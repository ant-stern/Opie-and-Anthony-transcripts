<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a deep dive into several breaking news stories.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, launched into highly offensive and crude jokes about the Casey Anthony trial, focusing on her appearance and perceived lack of responsibility, and the media's coverage.  Their commentary on the Medford Pharmacy murderer's arrest was equally graphic and vulgar, detailing the arrest itself and speculating about the suspect's motives and potential punishment.  They also reacted to Ryan Dunn's death, discussing the accident and speculating about his intoxication, playing audio of Bam Margera's emotional response.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Whitey Bulger's arrest after 16 years on the run.

The show continued with further speculation on Whitey Bulger’s capture, focusing on his girlfriend's role and his life in hiding.  A caller, Bill, provided context about Bulger's brother's political career and Bulger's past as an informant.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to Justin Bieber's early departure from an Adam Carolla show, allegedly due to Jim Norton's performance, with ensuing sexually charged commentary about Bieber and Selena Gomez.  Britney Spears’ appearance was also criticized. This was followed by a segment of listener-submitted "F.U.s," filled with vulgar and offensive language.

The anniversary of Nirvana's *Nevermind* led to a game where sound engineer E-Rock created impromptu songs about various anniversaries, including Lorena Bobbitt, John Gotti, Ed McMahon's death, and Amerigo Vespucci's first boat ride, culminating in a song about Glen Campbell's Alzheimer's.  Opie then recounted a lengthy, often vulgar, story about a childhood road trip with his father, detailing his father's drinking, driving, and CB radio handle, "Paisano Cowboy." This transitioned into a discussion of their own CB handles, “Wrangler” and “Diamond Dust,” and concluded with playing a portion of "Convoy."  A short pre-recorded segment with Christian Slater and a brief interview with Elijah Wood during a commercial break were included.

The Elijah Wood interview covered his career transition, including his early roles in *Back to the Future Part II*, a Paula Abdul music video, *Radio Flyer*, and *The Ice Storm*.  The majority of the interview focused on his FX show, *Wilfred*,  detailing its premise, darkly comedic tone, and explicit language, and even the show's genesis from a stoned conversation.  He discussed the *Lord of the Rings* experience, the time commitment, and the unique atmosphere.  He also shared stories about his ongoing auditioning, a particularly bad audition, and adrenaline-fueled activities like crossing Victoria Falls on ropes. The interview concluded with further discussion of *Wilfred* and a humorous bit featuring "BoboCop," followed by a brief appearance by comedian Joe DeRosa.  Brooke Shields was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

Comedian Joe DeRosa joined the show, discussing his over-prepared backpack, his 15-minute film "Cheat," and a humorous anecdote about meeting identical twin porn stars.  A highly vulgar discussion ensued, focusing on anal sex, strap-ons, and dildos, and the hosts and DeRosa debated the "gayness" of certain sexual practices. Brooke Shields then joined the show, and the hosts reminisced about a previous appearance where she'd consumed bad wine.  The conversation with Shields covered her career, her role in *The Addams Family* musical, dealing with rejection, and the challenges of live theater versus film. DeRosa briefly returned to promote his show before the segment concluded.

A post-show discussion involved hosts, Sam Roberts, Kenny, and Roland.  The conversation focused on the 10 o'clock hour, the dynamics between Sam and other staff members, including frequent insults.  Brooke Shields' appearance was discussed, along with Sam’s intentionally awkward question about her yoga body.  A push-up bet, Mars and E-Rock's push-up contest, and Sam's YouTube videos were also mentioned.  Mars’s personality and interactions, Weird Al Yankovic’s previous appearance, and Elijah Wood's legacy as a child star were also discussed.  The segment concluded with speculation on a rotating host system for the 10 o'clock hour.

The final segment revisited Brooke Shields' age and appearance, her flubbed Tony Awards presentation, and her husband's advice.  The discussion moved to comedians using joke writers, followed by analysis of her role in "Blue Lagoon."  A staged bit between Jim Carrey and Tom Hanks on Letterman was discussed, and the hosts debated their show's "time travel" technique.  The film *Inception* and a critique of *Titanic* followed.  The rotating guest-host segment was revisited, with brainstorming potential candidates and criticisms of other radio shows' formats. The hosts also compared their treatment to that of comedians, discussed their grand jury experience, and detailed the “Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal” segment. The co-host's new job in news radio was discussed, before the show concluded with Fez climbing a flagpole outside the building.

[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's satellite radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  You get it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  Hey, everybody.  Jimmy started us off by saying, let's see if they put Lindsay Lohan in jail.  Violates probation again.  I have empathy for someone that can't stop drinking and getting high, but there's something about her that just annoys me so much.  Your tits?  Yeah, that's the only thing I don't annoy me, actually.  I think what it is, it's one thing to be sneak and drink because you just can't help yourself, but it's another to shove it in everyone's face and have a barbecue with your friends. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, is that what she's doing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she's under house arrest.  She's having a barbecue in plain sight of everybody, obviously.  Are you allowed to do that?  You're allowed to have people over.  You just can't drink, right?  I'm sure you're technically allowed, but it shows a little irresponsibility, and then she doesn't pass another drug and alcohol test.  She really should just be laying low, you know? 
[00:05:00]  Just kind of lay low.  As in, uh, le-lo?  Le-lo, lay low.  Le-lo should lay low.  Lay low.  But she goes back to court today.  I don't know how many chances you give a person.  If it was you and me, we'd be done.  We'd be in jail already.  Right?  This would be over.  She's got ankle bracelets.  She's got, uh, you know, home confinement.  And she's still drinking.  And she sits there in the courtroom looking like... 
[00:05:30]  She's not as hot as she used to be.  No, she's weathered.  She's got that horribly bleached hair.  A little bleach in the hair is nice, but now when it gets down to that, just over the top, it looks like it's destroying the hair bleach.  Yeah, it pretty much is.  She's, uh, she's, what is she, a natural red?  Uh, yeah.  She hates her red hair.  You could tell she despises it.  She despises being a ginger.  Despised.  And will do anything she can to get rid of the ginger in her. 
[00:06:00]  What's that?  Freckly tits.  Oh, no.  She's rubbing out freckles every night.  She just hates everything about being a ginger.  Yeah, a ginger.  I think she takes Brillo pad to her cleavage, freckled cleavage every night.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's not a fan of being a redhead.  No.  Mm-hmm.  No.  Ah.  Godspeed there.  God bless her.  When's that?  Later this morning she goes to a little court action?  I believe so. 
[00:06:30]  I can't keep tabs on that many cases.  You got the Casey Anthony thing.  I'm all in with Casey Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He only had a half-day session.  No, that must have bums you out.  Yeah.  I want to see what's happening.  I think she's going to beat the murder one, though.  Yeah, I know.  You keep saying that.  Yeah.  I just want to keep reiterating so when it happens people go,  Wow, you were right, Ed.  No, they'll go, You're a dick.  You were right.  You're an asshole.  Hair looked good yesterday. 
[00:07:00]  She wore more of a ponytail style instead of a bun.  I hate the bun.  Mm-hmm.  Pulls it all back.  It makes her hair look like, uh, makes it look like she's really like a prison bitch.  Like that slicked-back, greasy fucking hair thing going on.  But, uh, with the long hair and the ponytail was flowing over her, uh, arm, over her shoulder.  Looking very, uh, looking much better.  In the big, tight, purple top she was wearing.  She looks, uh, some of the Google images on her, wow.  Crazy person. 
[00:07:30]  And then others really hot.  She's got, she made some crazy googly-eyed face at a lawyer the other day.  Oh, God.  And they freeze-framed it and fucking sent it, you know, it was making the rounds.  Are you outraged by that?  Oh, no.  That the media's manipulating pictures of her to make her look crazier?  The more pictures, the better.  Gives me a boner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There she is with her hair bleached blonde and some fucking tatted, jacked-up guy squeezing her tit. 
[00:08:00]  She's a party girl.  She sure is.  She's a party girl.  How much longer for this thing?  I don't know.  It's going on for a while.  Could be a while?  Yeah.  Rest of the summer?  Nah, not that long.  Oh, really?  Yeah, defense, they're just popping up clown after clown.  It's hilarious, really.  Yeah.  Oh, and that prosecutor, oh, boy.  Oh, is he a good one?  Is he?  Yeah.  Who, the Casey prosecutor?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  He did something the other day.  There was some woman, and she was giving testimony about the skeleton they found for the child in the woods 
[00:08:30]  and the fact that some people are speculating that the skeleton or the body was placed there  maybe only a few weeks before they found it.  And part of a hip bone was buried in the ground and, like, in the sediment of the ground.  Like, it had been there a while.  And she went, she goes, well, you know, there are a lot of animals around.  A dog could have buried it. 
[00:09:00]  And the prosecutor actually looks at her and he goes, a dog.  A dog.  He's doing, like, the laughing thing.  And, you know, the jury is just looking like, oh, yeah, that was ridiculous.  It was hilarious.  A dog.  A dog.  And he's like, no further question.  And they walk her away with no further question.  Like, I'm out of here.  Like, it's big out.  It was classic.  That really is a great time to walk away. 
[00:09:30]  Like, did you hear this shit she just said?  It took everything she had said, regardless if it was right, wrong, good.  The jury loved it, didn't like it, and just made it look silly.  It was like, it was a dog ate my homework moment.  It was like, oh, well, a dog could have buried it.  It depends.  Dogs.  Yeah.  So, uh.  You seem to be enjoying yourself.  Ah, keeping tabs on that one.  It is fun.  All right.  It's making headline news. 
[00:10:00]  It's making its bones off of this case.  Ah, yeah.  All those people that you'd never know.  And there's fights online for the 50 people a day that are allowed to go in and watch it live.  They're actually duking it out on the line.  Punching each other in the face.  It's wonderful.  You ever see the video of the fight?  It's great.  Yeah, I've seen it.  I've seen this as well, yes.  People are losing their minds.  People want to.  They want to check this shit out.  They want to be there and see this.  So they're pushing each other.  There doesn't seem to be much organization. 
[00:10:30]  Why do they want to see it to this point where they have to fight each other?  I mean, the morbid curiosity thing that we've talked about in the last couple of days.  Now it's like a fame thing.  But look, they're kind of headlock.  By the way, a lot of white people fighting.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Believe me, this is all about white people.  Let's point it out.  White people fighting.  This case is all about white people.  Black people do not care about this case.  It's all about white people. 
[00:11:00]  The people online are white people.  They're punching each other.  The court is full of white people.  The only black people involved seem to be the ones that Casey Anthony might have been sucking their dick to get a tattoo.  Oh, that's all white trash.  Hey, I like that.  A couple of black people there.  There was one sister I saw.  Yeah, probably going to some other trial.  Maybe a brother or something.  It's like emotions are probably running very high because of what the case is. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  It really is a very murderable woman.  She's the one that you'd like to see ripped to death by people.  Well, you're being a little harsh.  I meant raped.  Sorry, I said ripped.  You meant raped instead of ripped?  Yeah, it's ripped.  I think it's a lot of these housewives with kids that want to go in there, and they've already made their mind up, you know, which isn't hard to do.  I mean, this bitch is a lying sack.  She is quite the lying sack of shite. 
[00:12:00]  But, you know, it's the prosecutor's job to prove it.  I don't know if they prove murder one.  Seems like they're confusing everyone enough.  Yeah, yeah.  They're throwing a lot of monkey wrenches in there.  We can't convict the murder one thing.  Hey, front page of the paper, we got the Medford guy, huh?  Oh, my God.  The Medford Pharmacy murderer.  Boy, you gotta give it to the Suffolk cops.  They tuned this guy up.  Hats off, Suffolk County.  That's old school.  They tuned him up.  That's Lee Harvey Oswald shit they pulled on this motherfucker. 
[00:12:30]  First of all, he looks kind of like Lee Harvey Oswald.  Yeah, he's a scrawny little fuck.  And he got beat up pretty good by the cops.  Yeah.  As they brought him in, I guess there was a confrontation when they were trying to arrest him.  Well, there could have been a slight altercation inside the residence, Opie.  What happened was they got a tip from some girl that she recognized him from the surveillance tape.  Even though he was wearing a beard, huh?  Yeah.  A giant nose is hard to hide.  Oh, man. 
[00:13:00]  Fake beard.  Does he have a schnozzle at...  Everybody wants to get into the Oxycontin.  Yeah, he went out to his car.  Because this girl said, hey, I think this is my neighbor.  The cops staked the place out.  They checked all this shit and everything just lined up.  This guy's a fucking drug addict.  His wife's a drug addict.  Well, really fast, we're talking about the guy that walked into the Medford drugstore or pharmacy, whatever, early in the morning and just killed four people. 
[00:13:30]  Four people.  No one had a chance in this scenario.  He walked in and just started executing people to get the drugs.  He was afraid of being recognized.  So you're right.  They did not have a shot.  Because he killed them not as a reaction, but because he didn't want to be recognized.  He didn't want to be recognized.  He walked in with the fake beard.  They had him on surveillance camera.  Most of the people know the story, but just in case.  Anyway, continue.  Sorry.  No, they went to his house after figuring out, you know, it's him.  They checked his driver's license, saw that it matched the picture from the surveillance. 
[00:14:00]  And then they saw him get into his car like he was leaving.  And then I guess something tipped him off, and he went back into his house.  And the cops are like, that's all we need.  They took their big master key, that giant pipe full of cement, that metal thing, bam, bashed the door in.  And knowing that this guy killed four people and armed, I'm sure they didn't take any chances on, you know, hey, could you please get on the ground?  I grabbed him, and it looks to me like the guy obviously resisted. 
[00:14:30]  Because from what I see here, there looks like a right hook to his fucking eyeball.  And then a few other to his mouth, his forehead.  I'm sure they took his face.  A couple of boots.  A couple of boots, maybe.  Took his head and smashed it into the floor, you could tell by his forehead.  So the Suffolk cops, you know, not taking any chances.  And took him into custody, saying that his wife, very sick, she needed the pain pills, and his wife is saying that's why he did this for me. 
[00:15:00]  She's another piece of shit.  Just complete.  The wife, what a fucking fat rat.  Ugly.  What an ugly, fat pill popper.  Fucking, yeah.  Horrible.  Two white trash Suffolk County douchebags.  Someone asked me on Twitter, what should we do with this guy?  I'm like, they should have killed him on the way to the fucking police station.  Looks like they tried to maybe fuck his head up. 
[00:15:30]  Well, you know, obviously this isn't a death penalty case or anything like that.  Should be.  Even though he just executed four people.  Should be.  Even if it is.  We haven't killed someone in New York.  No, New York.  We've had the death penalty forever, and we haven't even used it yet.  They don't do that.  No, of course not.  Pain in the ass.  People will argue that point.  I don't feel like arguing the death penalty thing with anyone.  No, but yeah.  He should be killed, yeah.  He should just be fucking killed.  There's no doubt.  He's the guy, and that's that. 
[00:16:00]  Wait a minute.  Let me see.  I'm sorry.  Let me see that picture.  Does he look tuned up in that photo yet?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow, yeah.  It takes a while for the bruises to appear, too, by the way.  But they did it all inside the house.  Oh, yeah.  No cameras around.  Where there's no fuck cameras, no butt-in skis.  You could beat a man for a cop could beat a guy without the threat of a camera in front  of him.  And you can see the way that big cop, that's a big fucking cop.  Oh, that's a big boy, that guy.  If you have a cop coming in to get you, that guy is probably 6'5", and the guy's cuffed, 
[00:16:30]  and he's dragging him by the shirt.  By his shirt.  He's not even in uniform.  He's in a Mets shirt.  He's wearing a Mets shirt.  Like he got the call on his way to the game or something.  That is a big fucking cop, man.  That's a big officer.  Wow, is he not happy.  And then the old veteran is standing next to him.  I have a feeling the veterans got him.  Yeah, you think the old school guy?  You're talking about the big 6'5", younger cop.  I have a feeling it was the old guys going, let's do this for old times. 
[00:17:00]  I think the big guy got his shots in.  Oh, yeah.  No, I think they showed him what to do.  40 cops involved in the IRS.  This is what we used to do in the 70s.  And I'm sure they showed the younger guy what it was all about back then.  Go ahead and hold him up.  He's a war hero, Captain.  His wife's fat.  She does pills.  They got that scumbag.  You knew they would soon.  With that much surveillance video.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  You knew someone would recognize.  Nobody wants to go to jail for armed robbery.  That's a big jail sentence.  But it's like, now you'll never get out.  That's it.  He's done.  Who cares?  He'll have a good life in fucking prison.  Who cares?  He'll be fine in prison.  He got 8,000 hydrocodone pills.  I don't think he's going to do good in prison, to tell you the truth.  Why?  He doesn't have a record.  He doesn't have a fucking record.  He's not one of these guys that's been in and out of the joint.  He was in the military.  And he's been, like, in, I guess, some kind of a rehab thing. 
[00:18:00]  He entered Brookhaven Hospital for pain management, the first step before getting into a detox program.  A source said his addiction began years ago after he was injured playing hockey.  His wife has problems with her stomach, allegedly.  And he lost his job because he was stealing from fellow employees.  So when he lost his job, he had no health insurance. 
[00:18:30]  She couldn't get the pills.  So she's like, I need my pills.  I need my pills.  So he goes and shoots four people.  Anything to shut her up?  Yeah.  And I'm sure I'll be hearing shit about this one.  Why?  Licensed gun owner.  Oh, boy.  But allow me to retort.  He obviously was lying because once you go into treatment for drug addiction, you have to report that. 
[00:19:00]  And they will take your fucking license.  At least suspend it.  And take your weapon.  The fact that he's licensed and he had to fire a bullet when he got a gun or whatever.  Or one of them had to have a ballistics check already.  They got ballistics checks on your guns.  It's going to help concretely tie this guy into the crime.  Yeah, it's ballistics tests on your guns.  There's a casing and they have the actual round that they fire.  And the casing on the firing pin or the primer will show up. 
[00:19:30]  Your firing pin is like a fingerprint.  It's got different machine marks and everything.  And you can look at the firing pin and look at the primer and see where it impacted and match it up.  Now, why is everyone unique?  Why is the same machine not making the same marks?  It's just everyone's a little different.  On purpose they do it?  Well, they want to do it on purpose and really make these things markable.  But it would pretty much break the gun industry. 
[00:20:00]  You can't really.  They'd have to change all their machinery and everything.  But it's good enough.  I mean, every bullet looks different.  Now, you know.  I mean, believe me.  If any of my guns were used in a crime, they would be able to tie it because they do have ballistics on it.  But that's what they do now when they sell every gun here, at least in New York.  Wait, they couldn't do something that makes stamps each one with a number that is, like, you know, instead of a weird, whatever it is, marking, they can't have something that in one of those markings is a number?  Yeah, I guess they could, but... 
[00:20:30]  Why don't they do that?  I don't know.  It's all up in legislation.  They're trying...  But I mean, why don't the gun companies do that?  It would make it so much easier to track, you know, as years went on, it would be so much easier to track...  Yeah, I don't know.  And it's easily defeated by a criminal.  That's what it is.  A lot of these things are very easily defeated.  Files, bashing shit up.  I mean, there was a guy that committed a murder with a handgun and then just reamed the shit out of the barrel. 
[00:21:00]  And it pretty much ruins the gun for ballistics tests.  Oh, really?  Yeah, or you could take the firing pin that lands on the primer and give it a couple of zip-zips with a file.  A couple of what?  A couple of zip-zips.  Zips.  What's that?  That just reminded me of Charlie Callis.  Oh, so when the bullet gets fired, it comes through the gun.  As it goes through the chamber, it's also picking up markings?  Yeah, it goes as it's... 
[00:21:30]  The rifling inside gets picked up on the actual...  On the bullet itself.  ...and you can match it up with the rifling.  I feel like I get to ask you when I talk to Ann.  I get to ask a Discovery Show question.  It's great.  It's like watching TV and getting to stop it and get asked the man questions.  They're called lands and grooves.  It's like having a police officer in class.  Lands and grooves.  He's up there and you get to ask your questions.  Your questions.  Well, they got that fucker.  Yeah, they got this guy.  They got Dead to Rights.  But again... 
[00:22:00]  Just disgusting.  He'll be in life in prison.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got it.  But I mean, this is not a death penalty case, obviously.  Oh, it is.  It's a death penalty case.  It's premeditated murder.  But I guess what I mean by that is not a chance in hell.  They're pukey New York.  I don't give a fuck if going into it, it's a death penalty case.  It means nothing.  It means nothing in the end.  They never start with a death penalty case.  The prosecutors are like, no, we'll go, you know...  Yeah, they're not even brave enough to go death penalty case from day one. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  What the fuck?  These people didn't even have a shot.  Somebody's on the line wondering if someone in the store had a permit to carry if he had a chance.  No, that looked like a bad situation.  Because all four weren't in at the same time.  He walked right up to the counter.  And the two people were behind the counter.  So he was able to just shoot both of them.  And then two customers came in at the same time.  So those two customers that came in, he's able to just bop, bop, pop them. 
[00:23:00]  They walked into a fucking armed robbery.  Yeah, yeah.  Having a gun for your protection does not necessarily mean you're always going to come out on the winning end.  Of course.  This guy...  This guy knew exactly what he was doing.  He murdered four people.  He wasn't going to let any witnesses be around.  Didn't give them a chance in hell.  There was no reasoning, nothing.  No.  No.  Because he probably knew the pharmacist recognized him.  He probably was in front of that counter many times.  He'd been in there.  Getting those dumb pills for his wife and himself. 
[00:23:30]  That's how they got him.  He'd been in there.  Yeah, that's how they got him.  He was a regular there, this dummy.  I get you that they knew he was a regular because he probably knew where to go for the pills he wanted  because he had seen the pharmacist do it so many times.  Yeah, yeah.  He was probably so direct when he went to the pills that they just were like, who was getting these pills recently?  He's a dumb motherfucker.  He got 8,000 pills that day.  Wow.  He stole 8,000 pills.  And then what, just went home?  I guess so.  His wife was waiting for him in the car.  Fat, ugly wife.  Yeah, she was the getaway driver.  So she's waiting outside as he goes inside and kills four people. 
[00:24:00]  And she's, and as they're, you know, perp walking him, wherever the fuck they're taking him.  And yeah, Hank, she's blabbing to the press.  She's talking.  You know how you usually just put your head down?  Yeah.  People put their head down.  They're like, ugh.  She's like, he did it for me.  And it's like, ah.  Can we get that audio?  I don't know.  I want that audio.  It's probably somewhere.  He did it for me.  She's going to go through some withdrawals.  I hope she enjoys that.  Yeah, enjoy your shakies.  Because I'm sure they'll be a little slow as far as, you know, giving her a pill or two to calm her down. 
[00:24:30]  And this tells you what, yeah, this tells you what complete trash they are.  He proposed to her at the Nassau Coliseum, popping the question on the big jumbotron.  I wonder if I was there that night.  I don't know.  I always hate that.  I hate when you idiots propose at a sporting event.  Because no one cares.  Yeah.  You care, and that's great.  It's like, oh, God. 
[00:25:00]  What is this?  I think in a way, it's selfish, too, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I think in a lot of cases, the guy is more the sports fan that he kind of brings his wife-to-be into that sport, sort of.  Yeah, yeah.  And she might get into it and wear her pink Yankee cap.  Like, look, I'm kind of into the team.  Pink Yankee.  But I think in general, you're doing it for yourself when you propose at an Islanders game.  Yeah, of course.  Fucking...  Islanders might get a new arena.  Goes to vote August 1st. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, great.  Thank me later.  Ah, it's only temporary.  The tax is going up.  Yeah.  Yeah, great.  That's all Nassau County needs, is the taxes to go up again.  We need a new arena, though.  Highest taxes in the country.  Let the Islanders just pay for it, then.  Or any team.  Let the team pay for it.  I think Wang would pretty much pay for it.  Let Wang fucking pay for it.  I think he pretty much will.  He's got a couple of bucks.  He's doing what he can.  But it's like, let them pay for it.  It's their fucking building.  I mean, like, they're not giving a share of the profits to people.  Oh, no.  They'll rape us.  Everything will go up drastically if there's a new arena. 
[00:26:00]  They raise ticket prices, even though they don't even make improvements on the damn place.  Yeah, they always do that.  They go, yeah, it's going to cost some tax money to build the arena.  But, oh, the business it'll bring in, and the local economy.  And then you just go, why ain't I seeing this?  And how come I'm still paying the huge taxes?  Even after it's built.  Hey, let's say hi to Frank on Long Island.  Frank.  Oh, Frank was better?  Yeah.  What's going on? 
[00:26:30]  Hey, I have a question.  Why would a pharmacy carry 8,000 pills?  I have no idea.  Well, 8,000 pills isn't a lot.  It's not?  As people are coming in?  That's their supply, don't you?  You think 8,000 supplies is a lot, eh?  No.  I don't think it's a lot, Frank.  He managed to bag about 8,000 hydrocodone pills in the robbery, I sort of said.  You know what?  He had filled prescriptions at the pharmacy before.  Might have been a bunch of different type of pills.  No, maybe what happened, he knows exactly their schedule, too, when the new pills come in. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, maybe.  We have a Dwayne Reed in our neighborhood, and I forget what day it is.  I'm not sure if it's once a week.  But the truck pulls up, and they have bins.  Yeah.  Like, dozens and dozens of bins, and there's a guy out there with a fucking gun, and they have the side door open.  It's a CVS.  Yeah.  As they're bringing in the new supplies for the week or for the next two weeks.  Yeah, that's a lot of shit.  And I walked by, and I kind of took a peek in the bins.  I'm like, this is fucking some hardcore pharmaceuticals right on the sidewalk right now. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  So maybe this guy knew exactly when the new supply was coming in, and maybe that's what you're talking about with the 8,000 pills.  This place was also not your basic CVS.  It was a mom and pop, right?  And more of an industrial.  I think they also supplied some pharmacies.  Oh, really?  Some smaller pharmacies, and they had, like, everything stored in there.  Frank, maybe you're right, but I feel like 8,000 is nothing. 
[00:28:00]  The whole neighborhood is so popping, happy neighborhoods.  8,000, that would serve a couple hundred people, maybe, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, 8,000.  You see those big fucking containers that they open up, and then they go, sprinkle, sprinkle, sugar, sugar, sugar.  Me and Jimmy were talking about this case on the way home yesterday, and I don't understand why there's plexiglass in every pharmacy.  They make it – if you're addicted or you're going to do some harm, I don't give a fuck if I walk up to the pharmacy desk and there's a plexiglass. 
[00:28:30]  Those guys look like they're sitting ducks.  Like, it would be really easy to rob them if you wanted to.  Yeah, what is – and we talked also about the banks that are not doing it.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  What are they – why are they not plexiglass in Bank of America?  Yeah, what is that about?  So, this pharmacy is popping up on every corner now.  Some places there are.  Making people itch, like, I think I could get away with robbing this place.  But, dude, when you think of Medford –  Medford's a little rough.  And fucking – nah, you know, Suffolk camp – 
[00:29:00]  Even the Bank of America in New York –  Medford Patchogue is a little white trashy.  Yeah, it is white trashy, but –  And I say that because I do have family down there.  I do have – well, I don't want to say who I have, but I have family down there.  So, I kind of know that it's a bit white trashy.  And they said something about – this is the biggest mass murder, I guess they're calling it,  in Suffolk County, since DeFeo killed his family in the Amityville Horror House in 1974. 
[00:29:30]  So, it's not like this happens all the time.  Well, that's good to know.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's not bad.  Yeah, you know.  I mean, it sucks, but –  It does suck.  No, I don't know.  It's something about pharmacies and just – they're just so welcoming.  They're right there.  It really bothers me.  Hi, can I help you?  Yeah, you know, you go to get your little prescription filled or whatever, and you go,  man, if I was a bad guy or someone that has an itch, this would be kind of easy.  The itch. 
[00:30:00]  You know?  The itch.  That itch that can't be scratched.  I'm just thinking if you got the plexiglass up, it's going to diffuse some of this shit.  Yeah.  Because I really believe some more of this kind of weird shit is going to happen.  I really do.  Maybe not mass murder, but a lot more holdups.  This guy just had, like, all the fucking features of a douchebag.  Yeah.  Fucking – with his oxycontin and his fucking hydrocodone.  It gets better for him now, though.  The tune-up was the worst thing that's going to happen to this guy. 
[00:30:30]  Do you think?  You don't think the big cock in his asshole when he goes to prison?  Nah, you know what?  We talked to some of the guys.  They all swear there's no –  No one fesses up to it.  They all swear there's no cockplay unless you want the cockplay.  This skinny fucking douchebag.  They all swear, though, man.  Now, one guy has – he goes, it's not like that in here.  We've talked to the prisoners.  By the way, he –  They're fans.  He shot a black guy.  That ain't good if you go to prison.  Oh, really?  And you're a white guy.  Skinny white guy. 
[00:31:00]  And he shot a teenage girl who should be in a prom.  Yeah, a teenage girl.  Shot a fiancé of some guy.  I mean, gee, this guy's got to get – you just – he's got to get the big dicking.  He should just get pulled out in the parking lot and a fucking bullet should be put in him.  Yeah.  We're too polite.  We really are, yeah.  If it's obvious that he did it and everybody knows he did it and his ballistic cast and all that shit, just –  We're America, Jimmy.  We don't do that type of thing in this country.  You know this.  Oh, yes.  You know that, sir.  We're civilized.  We're a very civilized country. 
[00:31:30]  And we can't.  We just don't do that type of thing.  He's just another one that –  But sometimes I think you just should.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  It would feel good.  I'm not going to argue with anybody, by the way.  I could be a friend to you.  Is that what he said?  Huh?  The sisters in Shawshank.  Oh, fuck right.  What was the line?  I don't remember it.  I got to watch that movie again.  Hard to get.  He's like, ugh.  He's washing himself.  That fucking guy's hilarious.  Moving on.  Kaz in Virginia Beach.  Thoughts on Westboro Baptist Church protesting Ryan Dunn's funeral. 
[00:32:00]  That has a recipe for some disaster, my friends.  Oh, fuck.  They're just idiots.  That has a recipe for disaster.  They just know it's publicity for them.  So that's what they do it.  In America, you have the right to do that.  Yeah.  Because this is America.  But, man, I wouldn't be bummed out if something horrible happens to somebody.  Well, the last thing they were doing that made the press, a couple of the locals got involved 
[00:32:30]  and they were parked, the church, Westboro Church was parked at a hotel and they got  wind of it and pulled all their vehicles right behind the Westboro Church vehicles so  they couldn't even back out of the fucking hotel.  Who did that?  It was a bunch of people that were, that did not want them protesting.  So they didn't make the protest?  Westboro, no.  That's great.  Yep.  Make the cops tow every car.  Yeah, yeah.  And the cops will probably know what you're doing and hopefully. 
[00:33:00]  Cops will go by the book.  Cops will go by the book with it.  They'll tow it.  And go like, all right, look, that's going to take a while for them to get down here.  You know, they can't blatantly back up guys beating the shit out of these people.  But if you're clever and you want to do that, it's fine.  What a great fucking idea.  Yeah.  Yeah, they found out.  They were tipped off to where they were and just pulled up behind them, all their cars.  And these are a bunch of fucking good old boy rednecks with their pickup trucks and pulled  up behind them and was like, well, you ain't going anywhere. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  It turns out Ryan Dunn was pretty drunk, huh?  Holy mackerel.  197?  Oh my God.  Well, break that down for me.  0.197.  Well, 0.09 is legally drunk.  So it's twice.  And a little bit more than that.  So it's pretty much twice the legal limit.  And they estimate he was doing upwards of 140 miles an hour.  They said 140 today.  140 miles an hour.  Anywhere between 130, 140 miles an hour.  And trying to make an exit like that. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  Just woof.  He hit that guardrail, rocketed up into the top of the trees.  And then came down, crashed into the woods.  How high up are they estimating?  They were saying probably to at least 20 feet.  Wow.  Maybe higher.  So wait, did he hit the guardrail where, you know, the guardrail's on the ground and  then kind of goes up?  No, he just hit that fucking guardrail and was launched.  Why would that launch him?  I guess the energy going forward all of a sudden made energy going up. 
[00:34:30]  Picture taking a motorcycle and crashing into a low wall and the rider flipping up and  over the top.  Oh, I got you.  He went right up, ripped the car apart, and then it just was in point.  Killed instantly, I'm sure, right?  I would think.  Yeah, I would think.  They said yesterday that they both died violently.  Well, you're hitting that thing.  But I mean, they really suffered.  Really?  Yeah, if you die instantly, you're not suffering.  I would think you.  It still sucks, but.  I would think the second you hit that.  That's what I would think.  You're done. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  130 miles an hour, I mean.  Eee, that's fast.  140 now.  That's a lot.  Yeah, you're not smart enough.  That's fast.  I'm not a Porsche.  Hitting a fucking guardrail like that.  It's not exactly built for safety.  Like as far as like airbags all over and big fucking.  Yeah.  Turns out that.  Long skid marks on that fucking road.  You see that?  Oh, I just saw it coming.  I tried to.  Yeah.  There's a couple things we got.  Turns out that Bam and his mom predicted Ryan Dunn would die in a car accident.  Really?  Yeah, from Viva La Bam. 
[00:35:30]  Really?  Yeah, we got it.  It's on, you know, it was on his show.  I don't know if they made the actual prediction, but they basically were talking about how, you  know, this Ryan Dunn was taking chances with his driving.  Flipped a bunch of cars.  Wrecked a few cars.  And then someone in the discussion, I'm not sure exactly who said it.  We could, we could listen and figure it out.  Said they predicted that he would die in a car accident.  Wow.  Yeah.  You want to hear that?  Yeah.  Creepy.  And Dunn actually calls and says, dude, you better not have my car down there driving all 
[00:36:00]  over in my car.  Isn't that so funny?  Because that's all he used to do.  Oh, Glom's friends?  Oh, yeah.  Dunn used to drive around people's cars.  Well, the car he almost killed you kids in was not his car.  He was supposed to be working on it.  Well, Dunn learned his lesson when he rolled his car a couple months ago.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  He learned his lesson.  He'll never learn his lesson.  Dunn destroyed his own car by rolling it, by driving like an asshole.  He always drives like an asshole.  Too true.  I'm serious.  He's the worst driver, too. 
[00:36:30]  He's a grandstander.  I'll tell you.  He's going to eat it someday in a car accident.  He already has plenty of time.  I know, but I mean, like, that's his thing.  No, duh.  He's going to eat it one of these times.  He's wrecked six of other people's cars and three of his own.  I have him in the death pool for death by vehicle.  Yeah, he's the vehicle guy.  See, that guy officially said it.  And that wasn't Bam or his mom.  Wow.  That's on the DVD commentary.  DVD commentary of Viva La Banda. 
[00:37:00]  Great.  I can't wait for them playing.  I mean, I can't wait, but believe me, we all know they're going to be playing audio someday.  Me and Ope.  We know.  We told them not to do 270 miles an hour.  Oh, I'm only safe on a track.  I'm sure you're safe, but it's just things happen.  I'll just shut up.  You're crazy.  We told them not to make the zoom-a-zoom noise out the window.  This is what Jimmy worries about.  I know.  So, it's not, you know, I don't drive drunk.  No, you don't.  No. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, Bam's brother.  People say that was Bam's brother saying he was in the death pool.  It's just a horrible story.  It sucks.  And then we have audio.  I don't know if you want to hear it of Bam.  He went to the accident site.  Really?  Why?  Well, it's funny you should say why, because a few people asked me that yesterday.  And I said, I think you do, you know, when you're morning, you do some kind of, I don't want to say crazy things, but, you know, unpredictable things.  It's like, yeah, why would you go down there with the media? 
[00:38:00]  But, you know, I'm not questioning that, because, you know, he just lost his best friend.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever he wants to do.  Right.  A little different when you know the guy, too.  I don't know.  It just seems like, ugh.  You want to hear it?  It's rough.  But people said, like, I was criticizing them yesterday for going down there.  And then people are like, well, didn't you go to JFK's to Dealey Plaza?  And it is different, but, yeah, I guess I see that point.  I mean, there is, even though there's a historic assassination of a president, it's a little different than a guy drunk. 
[00:38:30]  It's still the same thing.  You're going to a scene.  So, yeah, maybe I would.  For the record, I would go.  I'm one of those guys.  I'm morbid curiosity, you know.  I guess I just hate the traffic slowdown so much.  I just resent people's nosiness so much.  Sure.  I don't know what it is, but, you know, there's a fascination there.  There's an animal instinct to it.  It's like, animally, somebody said that nature has that.  We're seeing what happened to somebody else and trying to avoid it. 
[00:39:00]  That's what the nature instinct is.  There isn't a nature reason for all this looking at stuff and wondering what happened.  It's ghoulish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, here's Bam.  He went to the accident site.  I think this is a couple days old now, and this is rough.  You really want to hear it?  Yeah, I haven't heard it.  All right.  Tonight, Margera went back to that crash site for the very first time.  It was in a very emotional time for him.  Right afterwards, he spoke only to us about his friend.  Oh, good for you. 
[00:39:30]  Good for you, newsman.  Only for us.  Good for you.  Good thing you got the exclusive.  God.  Oh, they're so hateable.  They're fucking the worst.  Why did he have to add that?  Because he's a typical dirtbag reporter.  Good for you.  Look at me.  Only to us.  Really?  That was important?  It's about you?  You're that powerful that he only spoke to you?  Only.  You just happen to be there, you asshole. 
[00:40:00]  Fucking douchebag.  We got the exclusive.  Oh, listen to that again.  What a...  I hate...  I fucking hate him.  Only to us.  Really?  Like he picked you.  Did he pick you?  Make sure you put in there that this is an exclusive.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure there was a graphic.  I'm sure.  Guaranteed.  Exclusive.  Fox whatever exclusive.  Sure.  You guys are all the same fucking person.  We don't notice the difference.  You guys do all that shit among yourselves.  But in the end, if Bam's on a news channel breaking down, we don't fucking know what news channel in the end, idiot. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  We're not thinking about that.  You assholes think all that shit through.  Right afterwards, he spoke only to us about his friend.  I've never lost anybody that I care about.  He's my best friend.  I was in Arizona when I heard, and I just remember I was with some friends having the best time ever.  And at 1230, I just started punching out the windows of the rental van and ripping out the speakers. 
[00:41:00]  And I don't even know why.  I wasn't mad at anything or anybody.  And if it's 1230 there, that means that it was exactly when he crashed.  You hear that?  Jeez.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere, he started just losing his shit.  He was three hours behind with that time difference.  And that would have matched up to when the crash happened. 
[00:41:30]  Damn, yo.  That's creepy.  You know, they were both fucking really drunk at the same time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He probably punches out things and rips things like every night.  Yeah.  That'd be like me saying, you know, I can't believe when my friend was killed.  I was there.  I was on Erosguide.com looking at prostitutes.  And I kind of sensed.  Yes.  But I think these guys all do drunk driving PSAs now.  Knoxville and Steve-O, who's sober.  And everybody thought Steve-O would be the first one to die because of how bad he was. 
[00:42:00]  I bet they all do drunk driving PSAs.  I would love to talk to Steve-O about this.  Oh, we try to talk to him.  Maybe down the road.  Look, dude, he's sober.  This may resonate more with him because his mind might be going, I'm lucky that wasn't me.  Yeah, he's still going strong with the sobriety thing, too.  So, uh, this continues.  He was the happiest person ever.  The smartest guy.  He had so much talent. 
[00:42:30]  And he had so many things going for him.  He's not right.  He's not right.  How do you get through this?  A lot of people have been worried about you.  I can't.  Do you really care, Mr. Reporter?  Uh.  How do you get through this?  Meaning, God, we really want more tears.  Yeah.  He is a fucking wreck. 
[00:43:00]  That's an all.  That's a rough interview, though.  So, what do you ask?  I mean.  Oh, Jesus.  I guess.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  Uh.  You don't have to ask anything, is the answer, to be honest with you.  Just shut your fucking mouth.  People have been worried about you.  I can't.  I can't.  Do you know how horrible it is being on an airplane for six hours, not being with everybody?  You're just stuck on an airplane. 
[00:43:30]  No one had any idea, probably.  It was the worst phone call I've ever gotten in my life, waking up to that.  You know, he, uh.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  He, uh.  Whew.  That just got me.  He said something that I think a lot of people can relate to.  When, um.  My dad was in that horrible car accident that ended up taking his life.  I found out when I was in Boston.  And I was just having, uh.  Wow.  Ooh.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  I was having a lunch. 
[00:44:00]  And I got the call.  And it was obvious.  This was not going to be good at all.  And then I had to drive from Boston all the way to Long Island just to get to my dad, my family.  Everyone at the hospital.  And when he said, do you know how it's like to be on a plane for seven hours just stuck?  I actually sort of broke down a little bit.  Yesterday, thinking about that.  Because it brought me back.  I had to drive from Boston to Long Island knowing that this was not going to end good.  But I needed to get to Long Island.  I was, I was going over a hundred miles an hour.  You just want to be able to beam yourself, you know. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Just peep myself over.  And I'm sure I'm not the only one that can relate to what he said there.  It's a, it is, it is probably the worst feeling that you could ever have.  Yeah.  I mean.  Knowing you're just, you can't get to where you need to be immediately.  Right.  To see what you could do or, in my case, I was hoping maybe to say goodbye to my dad.  But unfortunately, you know, that, even if I was there, it wouldn't have mattered in the end.  But.  Right.  Wow.  Wow.  Did that hit me.  Yeah.  That was a, that's a rough one, man. 
[00:45:00]  All of a sudden you find out, you know, I don't want to make it about me.  Let's go back to this.  His best friend is dead.  And he has to now get on a flight for seven hours, six plus hours.  Everyone can relate to that though.  Everyone's been somewhere when it was a death call or an illness call or whatever it was.  And you got to get where you got to go.  It's, it's fucking horrible.  Yeah.  Time.  To be on suicide watch.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  He's really depressed.  Time stands still.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  I mean, the clock can't go fast enough. 
[00:45:30]  Damn, that sucks.  Brick it.  I think there's a part two to this.  By the way, Ryan Dunn, you know, now they're saying up to 140 miles an hour.  Nate Sack from Westbury, he writes, if you jumped out of a plane with no shoot.  I wonder if this is true.  You'd hit the ground at approximately 140 miles an hour.  Is that all terminal velocity is?  That sounds.  That puts it in perspective.  I thought that would be faster.  Huh?  I guess I'm wrong, but I would have thought terminal velocity, which is what you hit.  Yeah, that's why I wonder if this is true.  I mean, Nate Sack's pretty reliable. 
[00:46:00]  Maybe he did some research on this or heard it somewhere.  I normally don't make terminal velocity errors when it comes to parachuting.  I mean, I'm known for that, and I'm almost embarrassed that I can't answer that.  Yeah.  Part two, bam at the accident site.  I'm curious, are fans still coming out to the crash site, Chris?  Yeah, perhaps even more today than yesterday.  Fans are flocking there, putting down flowers.  But one thing we saw in particular was this.  People coming to the crash site, fans and non-fans trying to gather, steal anything they could get their hands on, 
[00:46:30]  from broken headlights to parts of the engine block.  Some people actually told me they're going to put some of this stuff on eBay and sell it.  T-shirts and lighters and all kinds of things.  Let's break this down.  They are scumbags, which that is exactly right there why you hate them,  because they want to go and grab stuff for eBay.  They should be shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can I slow – I need to jump in, too.  It'll be one or two of those guys. 
[00:47:00]  Maybe.  He makes it sound like everyone's just grabbing it and throwing it on eBay.  That's – sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You're right.  But the media has a role, I guess.  But it's funny to listen to him being indignant about it.  They're going to capitalize on this much like we are.  At this very moment.  They're going to put it on eBay.  We sell the – how do you say that?  I just tripped.  Advertisers pay us, however you say it.  Ah, you got a great point.  They're both capitalizing on it. 
[00:47:30]  You've got a great point.  He talks only to us.  I mean, that's good video and audio of Bam.  I mean, it's good to see the guy be human,  and it is interesting to watch a guy that we like.  Somebody that fucking emotional boy,  if that Westboro church tries any shenanigans.  That's why I said it.  Wow, because Bam's the kind of guy that would just walk over  and fucking stab somebody.  But the thing is, they are used to people. 
[00:48:00]  They've been attacked.  They're fucking – I think they're crazy.  And all he would do is get himself in a legal nightmare and sued.  It doesn't seem like he would care about that.  No, no, he wouldn't.  But I mean –  That's what you need.  You need the people that don't care what's going to happen to them,  the repercussions, and just go over there and, you know,  do what's got to be done.  Yeah, here's the rest of the –  Stand those fucks.  They are hateable.  But what a great thing to block them in.  Yeah.  Just take the keys out of your car.  Yeah.  Here's where I'm parking.  Fuck you. 
[00:48:30]  Here's the rest of the audio.  eBay and sell it.  T-shirts and lighters and all kinds of things  have already made their way on eBay.  But at the crash site,  you should have seen these people pilfering away whatever they could.  I talked to a police officer.  They said, that is illegal.  That is still an investigation scene.  And these people should not be doing this,  but they were taking away everything they could get their hands on.  All right.  That's what people do.  Yeah, there's dirt bags.  I don't mind.  If they take it, to save it, that's ghoulish enough. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, I did do that on 9-11, so I can't –  Somebody gave me something and I still have it framed.  It was like, eh.  But to sell it is kind of –  It's shitty.  I'm sure more people are taking it just to have for themselves  than to put on eBay.  I would have had money on that.  What is that?  Ryan Dunn autopsy report.  Official one, the only one in USA.  $10,000.  Where is it?  On eBay?  Yeah.  Come on.  Who the fuck wants to buy his autopsy report? 
[00:49:30]  Any comments on that?  It's probably fake.  Fuck yeah, it probably is fake, yeah.  Of course.  Of course it is.  Somebody's fucking around.  Because of the toxicology reports,  the total couldn't be done yet.  His autopsy report couldn't be done this fast, can it?  I mean, the alcohol, maybe.  But can't they take two weeks to test for drugs and pills and all that shit?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Let me say hi to Grant, who lives close to the accident site.  Grant in Westchester.  Grant.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I live like a quarter mile right from that exit, and I drive by every day. 
[00:50:00]  And every time I drive by, there's like more and more people out there.  I drove by last night.  It was 8.30 at night, and there's a good 25 people out there roaming through the woods.  I've seen them grabbing branches and just ridiculous stuff.  It's insane.  People are vultures.  They really are creeps.  Yeah, I don't know what to say about that, Grant.  It's just ridiculous. 
[00:50:30]  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  See, I just bought an original 1979 Alien movie poster.  Ooh.  In my theater.  How much?  More than $500?  $500.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's in really good condition.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Would you let Sigourney Weaver sign it?  Um, you know what?  I would rather have a different something for her to sign. 
[00:51:00]  Not that piece of shit.  The original one with the egg.  Why wouldn't you have her sign it, Grant?  Because he wants it.  I know what he means.  He wants it.  But she was in the movie.  Yeah, but you know what?  That poster is just...  That's for the poster.  That's...  The original.  Yeah.  I would have, like, something else.  If I found out she was coming in at some point, and I could get another one or a different  thing, like maybe a card or something.  One of the, you know, like, things they put up in the theater or something like that. 
[00:51:30]  But the poster's got to be framed and put up by the theater.  I have Pulp Fiction also.  And Fargo, signed by William H. Macy, which is cool.  But getting a 1979 original Alien poster.  They're gettable, though.  I don't want to...  Anything like certain movie posters, like the big get in movie posters is for a film,  I believe, called Metropolis, which is...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  ...virtually impossible.  Even the original King Kong. 
[00:52:00]  Those are hard to get.  Like, really hard to get.  But the Metropolis one is the big one.  Yeah, that's...  What a cool poster that is, too.  It is.  I don't know how much it is, but...  Oh, the old Frankenstein cards, like...  Kenny.  Those are great.  Just take a picture of Club Soda Kenny.  Blow it up.  Ask him to sign it.  Throw a kid down the well, whatever the fuck he did.  They caught Whitey Bulger?  Yep. 
[00:52:30]  In San Diego.  What?  You're not...  That's like...  Let me go to JJ in New Hampshire.  How long has that motherfucker been missing?  16 years.  Wow.  We were in Boston...  I think he went missing right around the time we went to Boston.  Yeah, yeah.  We were up there 95 to, what, 98?  He was on the lam.  Holy shit.  On the lam.  What do you got on this, JJ?  Oh, he...  Morning, boys.  Hi.  Yeah, another spot on the FBI 10 Most Wanted open. 
[00:53:00]  They caught him this morning.  Uh, he was living in a small little apartment, just like any average old guy, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  I didn't really have that much detail.  I hope he stole my thunder.  Well, I'm sorry about that, sir.  That's all right, fella.  It's your job.  Hey, Whitey, where's your hat?  Let me see.  I got the story here.  Uh, Whitey Bulger, ledge Boston organized crime boss who was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted  list, has been captured.  Do they capture a lot of guys in the top 10 list?  It's very, very rare, right?  No, I think they get him with America's Most Wanted was a big one. 
[00:53:30]  Like, any time you can put them on...  But the top 10?  He's the longest to be on it.  Wow.  16 years.  Wow.  Taken into custody with his longtime girlfriend.  Uh, will make a first...  His first appearance in court Thursday, today.  Pair was arrested without incident from a residence in Santa Monica, California.  Santa Monica.  On Wednesday.  I wonder what you do when you're in...  You gotta...  He obviously has money.  How do they...  Maybe through a phone call?  Says the authorities credited a new publicity campaign for the tips that led them to the 
[00:54:00]  fugitives.  Somebody recognized him, I bet.  Some neighbor who had no idea who Whitey Bulger was.  They began airing a 30-second public service announcement on Tuesday.  On Tuesday.  Where?  Uh, centered on, uh, Craig.  Oh, the woman.  They got him through the woman.  His girlfriend.  If you watch that I Almost Got Away With It show, you ever see that?  He should have bailed on his girlfriend.  They always get nailed by a woman. 
[00:54:30]  They...  They...  Guys that...  Guys that get away with something, and then they escape, and they're on the lam, uh, they  change their name, their identity, they get licensed, they get all kinds of paperwork,  they get a job, everything's fine.  Then they...  And then, I fell in love with this girl.  And you know what happens?  They...  They get so infatuated with the girl, they tell them kind of what the deal is.  The girl freaks out a little bit, but, oh, it's okay.  And then the second the guy does something, like, looks at another girl, or breaks up 
[00:55:00]  with her, or she breaks up with him, she runs to the cops.  Oh, yeah, that guy?  Yeah, that fucking guy.  I've been living with him for fucking five years.  Yeah, but in this case, the FBI ran these spots, and they focused on her.  Like, we're looking for this woman.  Ah.  And that was Tuesday, and Thursday, people were like, fuck, I know that woman, she's  right over there.  Damn.  That's how they got Whitey.  Here's why, because Whitey probably stayed in the house.  He probably went out, she's the one who probably did everything. 
[00:55:30]  She did the shopping, she did all these things, and went to the pharmacy, and did all these  things that he couldn't, he was afraid to do, because he didn't want to be in public.  He probably went out very rarely.  So then, they knew that she'd be the visible one in every neighborhood.  Well, here you go.  So, this, Greg, or Craig, is 60.  The FBI says the public service announcement ran on shows that appealed to female viewers  in that age group.  The public service announcement listed some of Greg's or Craig's distinguished characteristics,  such as the fact she loves dogs and other animals, she goes to beauty salons, she worked 
[00:56:00]  as a dental hygienist, and likes to maintain her teeth.  And she had multiple plastic surgeries.  So, this was all the stuff they kind of threw in the PSA.  Yes.  Do you know a woman that matches some of this stuff?  Bulger, 81, ran the Winter Hill Gang in Boston, was indicted in connection with 19 slayings.  Jesus.  The FBI put Bulger on its most wanted list in 1999, had a special task force devoted to locating  him.  81.  He's had a fucking good run. 
[00:56:30]  You know what I mean?  When you're 81, you never want to go to jail, because he could live to be 98.  He could have fucking 17 years in jail, but you're 81.  You've had a great run.  Last time they had a sight on him was 2002 in London.  In London?  Yep.  Hey, JJ.  I'm sorry, but how is he flying after 9-11 with, I guess, a fake passport?  I don't know.  Everything's got to be fake.  Yeah.  And isn't his brother, who's his brother again?  I forget all this shit.  It's been too long.  JJ?  Yeah, I'm not really sure. 
[00:57:00]  He was the head of, was it BU?  Something, man.  Yeah, something like that.  He was a good guy on the other side.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I think they caught him because the chick's Facebook said, in a relationship with Whitey  B.  That was the first hint.  Yeah.  Much of a boy.  Very good.  And that's not bad, though.  He got 16 years.  Damn.  From 65 to 81?  And he was, what?  His age.  Oh, I think it was 1965. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He went on the land when he was 65 years old and made it to 81 before they got him.  Yeah, he probably thought he was home free, too.  Probably thought he was home free.  Yeah.  But how would he go and meet a new chick?  When you're 65, it's kind of hard to go out and meet a hot chick who you know is going  to keep quiet.  Oh, yeah.  You know, you got to just stay with your girl at that point.  Well, she was 44 when they ran, I guess.  If they were together that long.  Yeah, I think she's long-term.  Oh, yeah, right, right, right.  Probably. 
[00:58:00]  I don't know much about him.  I mean, obviously, I knew the name.  I knew he was at Boston.  Oh, yeah.  This is a huge story in Boston today, guaranteed.  Bill, what's up, buddy?  Hey, Opie, his brother was head of the Massachusetts State Senate.  That's what it was.  See, it was more important.  He was a politician.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Bill.  Yeah, they kicked him out of there because he was corrupt.  He's gone now.  They had a story in the local paper this morning of how they went to a South Boston home and  he come out in a T-shirt and they told him and he's just like, oh, what are you going 
[00:58:30]  to do?  You know, it's a big thing around here.  They finally caught him.  He was quite a rat.  He turned on a lot of people up here.  Whitey did?  Oh, yeah.  That's why he went into hiding.  Not so much because of the federal charges, because his own guys were after him.  You think his brother was in contact with him, which I guess would be really tough because  the FBI, I'm sure, was watching his brother real closely.  You know Howie Carr up here, right?  Of course.  Good old Howie who likes to talk about condiments and your favorite ice cream flavor. 
[00:59:00]  Favorite ice cream flavor.  I like Rocky Rolt.  When he has nothing else to talk about.  Yes, I do know Howie Carr.  He is literally obsessed with the man.  He has many books written on Whitey Bulger.  There's a lot of good stuff out there to read about him.  It's a crazy story.  I'd like to read something on Whitey Bulger.  You could also probably through an anonymous email address now.  It's a lot easier because all you got to do is just make sure you don't do it from home.  But if you have an email address that's fake and he has one that's fake that can't be  tied to you, as long as you don't check it from your iPhone or your home computer, 
[00:59:30]  they'll never know you're the one with that email address.  Go to a library or somewhere.  Yeah, that's a great point.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, buddy.  All right, Bill.  Thanks.  So there are ways to probably keep in touch now.  They're a lot easier than they were 20 years ago.  Yeah, probably.  Wow, they got Whitey Bulger.  I'm just trying to think they probably figure some way to fucking get you anyway.  Unless they follow you and then they use the computer or they get the computer chip.  What's that right after?  There's a computer chip.  There isn't one.  The chip. 
[01:00:00]  What's that?  Oh, God.  What do we got?  Obama Bieber gridlock today?  Yes.  Why is Justin Bieber in town?  Two of the most important people in the country.  Where's Obama going to be today?  Grubbing up money.  Grubbing money with Whoopi, I guess.  Where is he going?  I have no idea.  He's going to be all over the place, though. 
[01:00:30]  The Sheridan Hotel on 7th, the FDR, the heliport.  Sheridan Hotel on 7th.  Isn't that a couple blocks from here?  Yeah.  Is that the Mark David Chapman Hotel?  Sheridan on 7th and 53rd?  Yeah, that's the Mark David Chapman Hotel.  That's where he stayed before he shot Lennon.  I've gone to core dinners there, I believe, and then Sheridan.  They probably have good security.  That's where I met Laura Bush.  She spoke.  Really?  Roy Ennis' event.  Yeah, they've had Orrin Hatch speak there. 
[01:01:00]  But Bieber's already in town because Jimmy, didn't you tweet about Bieber last night, Jimmy?  Yeah, I did Carolla's podcast at Caroline's.  It was a sold-out show.  7.30.  And I woke up at 7 o'clock.  I totally forgot.  Actually, I did Bob Kelly's podcast in the day.  Totally forgot I had Adam's podcast.  I knew it.  And I napped.  I was just fucking tired and depressed.  And I woke up, and I'm on the phone with my manager.  And he goes, well, I got the podcast tonight.  I'm like, it's 7.30 now.  I fucking, my balls were awful.  I jump into a cab.  Literally five minutes later, I'm in a cab. 
[01:01:30]  And I'm calling Greg Charles.  I'm like, just tell Mike August I'm on my way.  And he goes, oh, you're fine.  We just, we're starting now.  So I made it there probably 7.45.  And I get in the back, and it's a full house.  And they said that, they said Justin Bieber's in the crowd with two big guys.  You know, he has to have security.  So Adam Brink.  Yeah, he does.  Why was he there?  I don't know.  I mean, maybe, I think that he just wanted to go to a comedy show.  He must know Adam.  Maybe he's familiar with Adam.  He's just a little kid, though.  What is he, 17?  Not anymore. 
[01:02:00]  You look at him.  He's starting to look like these fans of his aren't going to be liking him anymore.  Like, look at that picture.  You see the little girl and the little fresh-faced Bieber.  You think he's bummed that his fan base isn't growing with him?  Yeah.  No, but they'll all fuck him.  These 17-year-old chicks that fucking...  That's a 12-year-old.  Not her, but I'm saying in general, the girls that like him.  I don't think a lot of 17-year-old girls are fucking, like, doing that with Bieber. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  I really don't, man.  Unless he can make the jump.  He's stuck in kiddie land, I'm thinking.  He's doomed.  I would say most of his fan base is extremely young as he continues to grow.  I didn't know where he was sitting in the room.  God damn it, that's Selena Gomez.  So we...  Adam does like a half hour.  Yeah.  Just talking and stuff, and he's very engaging.  And he brings me on, and we're just talking about massages and happy endings and all that stuff.  And I'm talking about a finger getting slid in my ass.  And then we just keep going, and we're fucking around. 
[01:03:00]  And then I guess everybody knew he was there.  And Adam all of a sudden just goes, yeah, I guess Justin Bieber left on stage, he says that.  Probably your material was too much for him.  That's probably what it was.  A little too blue.  I don't know.  I don't know if he had a time constraint.  I would love to think that you're the reason he had to leave early and find something else to do.  Well, I had a feeling it was that, because he was...  I found out where he was sitting afterwards, because I toasted the audience.  I'm like, we arguably chased the biggest music star on the earth out of the room. 
[01:03:30]  Here's Dawson.  Everybody left.  But he was too, like, I was sitting, Adam was in the center of the stage.  I was stage right, facing the audience.  And he was extreme right, right by the...  When you go to Caroline's, you walk in the main door.  Say you're facing the stage.  If you're looking at a comedian on the stage, and you look to your left, there is a side door against the wall.  And he was right by there.  So I guess they got him in and out of there.  Yeah, yeah.  Because someone goes, yeah, he left.  He's squeaky clean.  So probably when you guys started down that road. 
[01:04:00]  Without a doubt.  They're like, we got to get you the fuck out of here.  You should apologize to Justin Bieber.  He's young.  He probably...  No, he probably just didn't enjoy it.  Apologize.  Someone said he didn't laugh once.  Oh, God.  He's got no sense of humor.  Well, he has no life experience yet.  Of course.  He travels the world, but he still doesn't have life experience.  He's also...  I don't even...  I'm not offended by it.  He's fucking...  He's 17, and he's hearing about, you know, getting jerked off.  I mean, that would have cracked me up when I was 17.  But I didn't have an image to...  It's all his image.  He's got it.  And he probably didn't laugh because, oh, if I laugh, it'll look like I condone this. 
[01:04:30]  Then don't go to a comedy club.  Maybe that's just not his thing.  Or maybe where he was sitting, he was afraid too many people.  I don't know.  Maybe he wasn't in the back of the room.  I told you, when I saw Tiger Woods years ago, when he came to see Dice, and I was watching  him while Andrew was on.  Yeah.  And he was literally...  He was laughing.  But he was literally on the table, like, humped down, laughing.  And it's like sometimes people are fucking...  He just may not have thought it was funny.  That's very possible.  He's young and this clean-cut guy. 
[01:05:00]  It went over his head.  No, people get it.  She has a giant head next to him, by the way.  Holy shit.  That's just forced perspective.  Selena Gomez has a wonderful head.  She's pretty.  Yeah, he probably didn't enjoy the show.  She has too much of that dirty blood in her, though, for you, Ant.  Nah.  There's a little too much dirty blood in her.  Nah, I don't know.  I kind of like that.  She looked good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how filthy could Bieber's dick be?  You know.  He's not having sex with Selena Gomez.  Oh, I think you're crazy. 
[01:05:30]  Of course you probably are.  Hell, he's not.  But you don't think so?  That's two pulses getting together going, look, this is good for both our clients.  Yeah, that's why she was really hot.  They do all that shit all the time.  I would bet money no.  Maybe.  Now, who's looking rough is that Britney Spears.  Did you see?  Oh, God.  There were a few pictures they showed of her in her latest tour.  And she looks rough, man.  A little haggard.  She looks banged up.  Yeah.  She looks way older than her age.  Yup.  She does look beat up.  A little rough around the edges. 
[01:06:00]  Life has fucked her up a bit, huh?  Yeah.  Now, she's had plenty of life experience.  Hell, fucking yeah.  Everything.  I just got a tweet.  If Justin Bieber didn't chuckle once, my love for Jim Norton has just multiplied by a billion.  That's great to think that you might have chased him out of there.  I'm pretty.  It had to be that because if it wasn't a time constraints thing, or maybe he just wanted to go to a stand-up show and was like, what is this?  He has a new cologne coming out.  Is that why he's in town?  Bieber did Letterman last night.  It better be O'Day my fingers. 
[01:06:30]  Charlie, last call before the break.  What do you got?  Charlie, let's go.  Whitey Bolder killed 19 people.  And the only thing Anthony cares about is that the woman couldn't keep her mouth shut.  Yeah, see?  He was just saying how these guys took court.  Yeah, he was just telling us how to get caught.  I ain't no fucking rat. 
[01:07:00]  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  All right.  What's the matter with you?  He might have killed 19, but I want to know what those people did that pissed him off so badly.  All right.  Thank you, Charlie.  Not a clue.  We'll break.  I'm sure they were bad people.  We got Elijah Wood coming in.  Holy shit, that's an A-lister.  Yes, he is.  He's a big star.  And Brooke Shields is certainly an A-lister.  Oh, Brooke Shields is coming in.  I forgot about that.  He's coming in to say hi as well today.  And 9-15, yeah.  Our new friend, Brooke Shields. 
[01:07:30]  I, um...  Yeah, Wilford is on FX.  It's Elijah's show.  I enjoyed it.  I actually enjoyed it.  I watched three of them yesterday.  Yeah, it's weird.  It's about a talking dog.  It's a very bizarre show.  But there were some brutal jokes, which I kind of enjoyed.  Yeah, I saw it.  I saw it last night as well.  Elijah.  Boy, what a career that guy's had.  It seems like you've got to be...  Ever since it was a little tater tot.  You've got to be famous to get a show on the air.  That's what I tell myself.  Ah, so they're not willing to build new shows around new talent. 
[01:08:00]  Around me.  Around new talent.  Oh, oh, you.  Oh, shit, what happened?  But, I don't know yet.  Nothing.  I'm just...  Nothing has happened yet.  I'm still here.  Like, meaning in this place in my life, not in this room.  No, no, no.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, fuck, I'm still here.  No, no, no.  God damn it.  But I mean nothing.  That's what's happened.  Nothing.  It's fiercely depressing.  Oh, yeah.  He was in The Good Son, that one.  Was he?  That was a good one.  Oh, yeah.  With Macaulay misbehaving.  I love that movie. 
[01:08:30]  He was a bad boy.  Sure he was in his denim coat.  Look at that.  You're all rough.  You got leaves on you.  Come here.  Let me muss your hair up.  Come here, Macaulay.  Look at your denim coat.  They throw the dummy over the...  Don't do that.  You're going to get in trouble.  Take your little hat off.  They fucked up Macaulay Culkin's career, man.  He's smiling.  By having him die in that other movie from the bee stings.  And then making him like this evil kid in this fucking movie. 
[01:09:00]  I cried so hard.  You're dead?  He got the bees all over him.  Yeah.  And I had a big tent in my sweatpants.  He was allergic to the bee stings.  Yeah, I know.  I was like, be careful.  They're going to start stinging you on your penis.  Wait, I don't think...  Got to get someone to suck the person out.  I got a person.  You got little bee stingers in your penis.  Why don't you come over here?  Let me get the bee stingers. 
[01:09:30]  The bee stingers.  Let me pull them out with my teeth.  I'll rescue you.  I don't think...  I think Uncle Paul should be arrested.  I was crying a lot in the theater when I seen that one.  Yeah.  What about that Klomsky girl that was in that?  Oh.  The girl that was in that movie.  I couldn't see through my tears.  I had such a big lump in my sweatpants.  You had an Anna Klomsky.  My little friend was with me watching. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yeah?  Did you have popcorn?  Sure I did.  Well, allegedly.  The hole in the popcorn.  I had to leave the theater.  There was a problem.  Somehow there's always a problem with you.  Misunderstanding.  The boy was crying.  I was simply comforting him.  Gotcha.  I said, come here.  Put your head in my lap.  A lot of misunderstandings in your life.  Sure there are.  Yeah, the scene where little Macaulay is in the coffin.  Oh, and he's...  I like...  Look at that. 
[01:10:30]  Who's that?  That's that Klomsky.  Yeah, when she's looking through the banisters.  I love that.  When she looks through the banisters at the wake.  Yeah.  Sure.  This movie was the worst idea.  This my girl.  No, it wasn't.  It was depressing as hell.  There she is with her little blue jeans and tucked in postal shirt.  Looks like a little postman.  Yeah, gonna deliver some mail in your postman shirt. 
[01:11:00]  She's crying.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Michael G.  Climbing Tom's J.  His face hurts.  Oh, he's so...  Ah, I like it.  He's a beast.  He can't see without his glasses.  Who wants to be at this funeral?  Looking at a little kid crying because another little kid's in a box.  He's so perfect with his little white suit.  He's dressed like a little angel with a blue tie.  Bet she's got no pants on. 
[01:11:30]  Bet she has undershorts and got torn off by a mortician.  So it's got to be...  Kurt Love's got to be real literal.  He's dead, dummy.  He can't see anything.  No shit.  You know what?  Did you see how she ran out of the house?  Yeah.  That has bothered me ever since I saw that movie.  They hired this little girl and she can't run.  She did the retard run?  Yes, it's horrible.  Oh, I hate him with the glasses.  He looked too old.  Look, the big kiss is coming. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, boy.  Get the old smooch going.  I don't think it's that big a smooch.  I should show him cartoons first.  The adult kind.  Have some wine.  Come here in a bike shop.  Put you in a tub with Dudley.  Dudley?  I hated his father's teeth.  They're so big.  Like rowing oars.  How do you chew at those?  Goddamn black tattletale.  Black kids are always tattling. 
[01:12:30]  My friend Mark got in big trouble in D.C.  Yes, he certainly did.  I just wanted to play some video games.  Let me tug you a little chocolatey.  So much bigger than the white kids down there.  Oh, fuck.  Look at Paul disgusts me.  Yeah, like a hard piece of candy.  Leaning in a little kid porn.  Wow, that was a big one.  Sure, they always pull back at first when you kiss them. 
[01:13:00]  Little boys.  Little boys.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I'm going to eat.  I got to go take care of this.  Yeah, why don't you take care of business?  Yeah.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to Paris Hilton.  Paris, fuck you.  You wasted 20 minutes of quality Opie and Anthony time by sitting there being nothing but a 
[01:13:30]  stump.  Fuck you for that.  And fuck you for just being Paris Hilton.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I wanted to give a big fuck you to the girl that was on her rag when I was fucking  her in my car.  And she didn't tell me she was on her rag.  I'm sitting there fucking banging her.  And now it looks like I got fucking splatter art all over my dashboard.  Fuck you.  You bleeding cunt.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to my sister Jody. 
[01:14:00]  I get a phone call at fucking work today saying that you called 911 and had an ambulance come  and take you to the hospital because you had chest pains.  I drive all the way to fucking Bel Air and I get a text message from your husband saying  she doesn't want any visitors including your parents because it stresses you out.  You could have been having a fucking heart attack and all we want to do is come up there  and be with you in the ER and make sure you're all right.  You know what?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I got a big fuck you to my dick. 
[01:14:30]  Not only is that fucking little, you gotta come in fucking 20 seconds.  Fuck you, you little prick.  Fuck you.  Hey, I like to give a fuck you to the fuck you line.  Who's doing the fuck yous?  He sucks.  F.U.  Fuck you.  This fuck you goes to my mother-in-law.  You live in my fucking house.  I pay the fucking bills.  You know what that means?  You have no fucking say.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This is your official countdown clock. 
[01:15:00]  There are now 67 weeks left on the contract.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU line 1.  That's 866-FU line 1.  Hey, now this is D.L. Hughley.  Hey, this is Brewery.  Hey, everybody.  It's Joel McHale.  Hi, this is Jim Jeffries.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Yes. 
[01:15:30]  Well, yes.  Why are we playing Nirvana?  Let me see.  There's got to be a reason.  Let me see.  Let me see.  There's a theme.  Second break.  What?  There's a second break.  That's why we're playing Nirvana?  Because it's the second break?  No, that's when the themes come.  Oh, really?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the thematic.  I don't see any Nirvana news. 
[01:16:00]  I don't see any Nirvana stuff on here.  It's under entertainment.  Opie, it is the 20th anniversary of Nevermind.  No.  20th anniversary edition of Nevermind will be released in September.  That was...  So what?  That announcement came out yesterday?  I guess so.  That's retarded.  That's a little bit of a stretch.  That is a stretch.  A little bit of a stretch.  Nothing else happened today that could have made...  Yeah, why don't you do...  Like music?  You could have done like...  All right, you know what? 
[01:16:30]  See, top of my head.  Let me think.  No, I got one.  E-Rock.  Let's see how damn good you are.  You got one minute to do this, okay?  Oh, shit.  Lorena Bobbitt cut off John's penis 18 years ago today.  You got one minute to come up with a song.  Wow.  And go.  Go, Virus.  I mean, E-Rock.  And go.  Lorena Bobbitt.  And just play the song as soon as you got it.  Lorena Bobbitt cut off John's penis.  That's 18 years ago.  18 fucking years ago.  Oh, he already has one.  Ah, Detachable Penis.  Very nice. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Very nice-y.  E-Rock.  E to the Rock.  Pulls it together.  Let's try another one.  And comes up with a great fucking song.  Who did this again?  Detachable Penis.  King Missile.  That's right.  All right.  How about...  Hmm.  You want to try one in?  Could be anything.  Trying to see what the...  Oh, let's see.  It could be anything.  It could be the Glen Campbell news.  The Chris Brown thing. 
[01:17:30]  That's pretty easy.  I'm going to go with something a little harder.  All right.  Turn off this.  We're in the middle of a bit, Jimmy.  You're coming...  We're coming back from break, let's say.  We're coming back from break.  Mm-hmm.  And the first thing I want to talk about,  and I need a little music to start it off with,  John Gotti was sentenced to life in prison 19 years ago.  John Gotti, Dapper Don,  sentenced to life in prison 19 fucking years ago.  That was 19 years ago? 
[01:18:00]  I don't know what happens to all this fucking time.  What was that?  That's 92 then, I guess?  Mm-hmm.  That's very good.  See?  The Godfather theme.  I would have went with Brother Joe's version, by the way,  just to pump it up a little bit.  To pump it up a little more rock.  But fair enough.  He got it.  Something like that.  Jimmy, you want to try one?  I don't know what you're doing.  I came in...  I think you're doing a live read.  I came in at the...  Well, we came back with some Nirvana playing. 
[01:18:30]  So I'm like, why is he playing Nirvana?  It turns out it's the 20th anniversary edition of Nirvana's Nevermind,  which will be released in September.  I guess that news broke.  Okay.  So we're trying to see how quickly  Iraq could come up with a song  that goes along with something that's in the news today.  Iraq always looks at the prep sheet  and decides in the second break,  when we come back,  what the hell  we should come back to.  So we decided Nirvana,  we weren't really feeling that that was that strong.  So if you look at this prep sheet 
[01:19:00]  and go like, hmm...  Did you do Ed?  No, no.  How about this?  Ed McMahon  died two years ago  at the age of 86.  And go.  Go.  He's got one minute.  We gave him a minute,  which is fair enough.  I would have thought that was longer than two years ago now.  Oh, yeah.  Ah.  All right.  Hey, we're back.  That's more morning zooish.  By the way, we're back.  But he did get it.  Boy, we did lose Ed McMahon  two years ago 
[01:19:30]  today at the age of 86.  All right, here's one.  Obviously the sidekick for Johnny Carson  and then later going on to Star Search,  Ed McMahon,  two years ago,  dead at 86.  You got another one, Jimmy?  I do.  Okay.  Turn off this.  And it was  345 years ago today,  Americo Vespucci  took his first boat ride.  Americo Vespucci. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Iraq?  Is this a new character?  Ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Play some tango music.  That ain't bad.  I like this.  He's much better than the virus  at coming up with shit.  I don't know.  I just made that up.  Of course.  Well, duh.  America is huge.  You discovered America, right?  What are you named, America?  A, um...  Or Columbus discovered America.  We made it...  America.  We made it too easy.  Let's really start challenging Iraq. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Iraq, you ready?  Glenn Campbell,  diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  Now we pump it up.  What?  Yeah, but I...  You know what?  What song is it?  I don't think it's fair  just to play a Glenn Campbell song.  What song is it?  I don't know.  That's my impression of Glenn Campbell.  Same old song.  I remember this one.  Thanks, Steve.  There you go.  Lonely sidewalks of Broadway.  It's a good tone, right? 
[01:21:00]  Where hustle's the name of the game.  I think I remember this song.  You think.  You got the words right.  Yeah.  This is good.  I can tell.  It's going so long.  How about you turn up a little bit  for fucking non-bats?  This is the big...  On me.  Right.  Right.  Oh, it's Rhine Stone Cowboy. 
[01:21:30]  Okay.  Oh, I know this.  I just didn't know the lead-up.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Like a rhinestone garage.  You know, it's got Alzheimer's.  That's enough of the words.  Like a rhinestone cow, Patty.  No.  I don't know.  I was more of a Wichita lineman guy myself. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know that one.  I like that song.  Got a little Wichita lineman.  Here's how you do it.  Hey, bitch.  Get Wichita lineman.  Oh, shit.  That's how you handle things in this fucking company.  Yeah.  When you're riding the train.  The soul room.  Dee, dee, dee, dee, dum-dee.  All this shit reminds me...  It just reminds me of taking that trip to California in the Pinto with my dad, my brother, and his girlfriend. 
[01:22:30]  Not my brother's girlfriend.  My dad's girlfriend.  And driving from New York to California in a Ford Pinto.  Wow.  Was that a good ride?  That sucked.  There was a cooler in the back for all of dad's beers.  And we used to have to be in the back.  And it was a little hatchback.  And the seat wasn't even up.  So we had to lay down the whole time.  And then the cooler...  From where to where?  From New York to Los Angeles.  You had to lay down the whole time?  Yeah, we stopped once in St. Charles. 
[01:23:00]  I think St. Charles, Minnesota or something.  Did you try to sit up?  South Dakota.  St. Charles, South Dakota.  I don't even know where it was.  Was he drinking the whole time?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Drinking the whole time.  Wait, did you try to sit up?  It's a hatchback in a Pinto.  You couldn't really sit up.  We could sit kind of Indian style a little if we ducked down.  Your dad was an asshole.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, but he was.  And then, well, you know, he had his own agenda.  And the coolers started leaking. 
[01:23:30]  Hold on, but I've got to slow you down.  Yeah.  So New York to LA, you have to lay down the whole time?  You can't even look out the window?  In America?  Well, it was a hatchback, so you could kind of look out the window.  The whole thing was a window.  So the back was, yeah, yeah, the back.  So there were a couple of pillows.  So we propped the pillows up behind the driver and passenger seat.  Oh, I see.  And kind of lay down that way.  So you look out the back window.  Yeah, so you look out the back window.  That's not as bad.  I get so carsick doing that.  And it was, well, as a kid.  I didn't even care.  But his cooler would, like, sweat the cooler. 
[01:24:00]  So I woke up, like, with cold, freezing water on my leg.  And he's like, all right, come on.  We're going to check into a hotel.  And it was this one-horse town fucking hotel we checked into.  Was it, like, a five-star hotel?  Oh, this was a piece of shite hotel in the middle of nowhere.  But we stopped at a few places.  We stopped and saw Mount Rushmore.  Nice.  And then we saw the Badlands in South Dakota.  And then we would dip down south and saw the Grand Canyon. 
[01:24:30]  Nice.  And the Great Meteor Crater.  Well, I guess he's not an asshole.  That sounds like a good trip.  It was fun, but he was something there.  And at night, he would drive with a beer, a beer between his legs, and the fucking, and  his .38 in the console.  Just driving around like, yeah, that's how you do it.  Oh, yeah.  He had a gun all the time.  Oh, yeah.  He was another one.  All the time.  Well, not quite as legal as his son, Anthony. 
[01:25:00]  But, you know.  You're a lot like him.  Well.  You like to drive, I don't want to say fast, but.  He wasn't a fast driver.  He was a weavy driver.  He could weave with the best of them.  Were you ever scared in the car with him?  Petrified.  Yeah, yeah.  There were many times I was petrified of falling off the edge of the Ortega Highway in California,  going to Lake Elsinore.  And it was one of those roads that were just like, these are, it's a movie road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's a fucking movie road.  Like that fucking, what was that movie with the truck? 
[01:25:30]  Empire Strikes Back.  Chasing Dennis Weaver, the whole movie.  Duel.  You ever seen Duel?  Oh, Jesus, no.  Yeah, that's the road it was like.  It sounds like the Pacific Coast Highway.  Yeah, but.  PCH.  But without, like the ocean, it was just, it was just fucking sheer cliffs.  That's what the PCH is all about.  And there'd be these big Conrock cement trucks that would come barreling down the other side.  And Dad's just kind of looking down. 
[01:26:00]  And he'd be like, hey, on the CB.  He's trying to drive, drink a beer, steer down this road on the CB.  Man, it's a Paisano cowboy.  Anyone out there got your ears on?  Paisano cowboy.  Wait, wait, wait.  That was his handle?  Yeah.  He rules.  It's a Paisano cowboy.  I take back the asshole comment.  He rules.  The Paisano cowboy?  You never said that before.  Oh, no, no.  The Paisano.  I forgot. 
[01:26:30]  I just remembered.  His handle was the Paisano cowboy.  And one of the greatest things to watch was him when he'd be on the CB.  CB, and he'd key down, and he'd be talking, and he'd have to make a turn.  So he'd put his hand with the CB mic on the steering wheel.  And you know how you just whip the wheel around?  He'd do that, and the little curly mic cord would get caught around the steering column,  and his hand would be like, goddamn son of a bitch.  He'd be like, it's all pissed and can't steer now, interrupting his driving even more. 
[01:27:00]  The Paisano cowboy.  Paisano cowboy.  And this was me.  The hand-wrangler.  It's wrangler.  Paisano cowboy, you got your ears on?  Who was your handle, Paisano cowboy?  No, I was a wrangler.  Yeah, we know that.  Ew.  I didn't know he was the wrangler.  We've talked about that before.  As you should have been.  I was the wrangler because I worked at Jimmy Jackson's rent string there,  and I used to have to wrangle up the horses. 
[01:27:30]  Got your ears on.  This is the wrangler.  The wrangler.  And a lot of times, Dad didn't answer back,  and I got very nervous as to his whereabouts and his safety.  Oh, you would try to talk to your dad on the CB?  Yeah, yeah.  What a fucking dork.  He wasn't home, and I was like, you know,  there were no cell phones or anything.  And you were hungry.  So I was starving.  And I would try to, you know, I would try to be like,  I'm like, hey, it's a wrangler.  Paisano cowboy, got your ears on?  And then sometimes this old bag, Tiny Bubbles, would come on. 
[01:28:00]  She'd go, oh, wrangler, this is Tiny Bubbles.  I'd be like, hi, Tiny Bubbles.  It's like, yeah, why don't you just call for your dad,  like maybe every half hour instead of every five minutes?  I'd be like, oh, okay, Tiny Bubbles.  They were telling you to shut the hell up.  Because I was always, breaker, breaker one nine, breaker one nine,  for Paisano cowboy with my daddy.  You just wanted your daddy.  Because he was probably out, you know, getting lit up at the depot 
[01:28:30]  or at the Swallows Inn.  What does breaker one nine mean?  That means, hi, I'm on channel 19.  I would like to get on the channel and request to talk to somebody.  Do you interrupt people when you say that?  No, you wait for people's conversation to be done.  It was pretty much the phone ring.  So it'd be like, breaker one nine, and then it's like, go ahead.  And then you kind of have permission.  You don't just get on and go, hey, what are you doing? 
[01:29:00]  You'd be like, you got a break first.  Break, make sure there's not a conversation going on here, motherfucker.  There were rules.  Do people really, how could you stop somebody from interrupting  if someone kept interrupting?  Oh, you couldn't.  You couldn't.  It was a constant barrage of, hey, motherfucker.  You're not allowed to curse on this air radio.  Yeah, fuck you, you fuck fuck.  And that's what the CB turned into.  So people still have CBs, right?  Wow, I think only truckers have them.  But do truckers still use them? 
[01:29:30]  I think the truckers still use them.  To talk to each other on an open line?  Yeah, and now it must be easy because, you know,  you don't have all the riffraff you had in the 70s when everybody had a CB.  People were getting bass stations at their house.  We had a bass station.  I had a mic like fucking, like in The Shining.  Call the police.  K to K-12.  Yeah.  I forgot about bass stations.  We had one too.  A bass station.  And then you had your antennas on your car.  You had to get them matched. 
[01:30:00]  It was always hard to match your antennas.  Did you just go out, in our case, just out to our driveway just to hang out on the CB?  And talk on the CB.  Yeah, on a summer night.  Yeah.  It's dark out.  You're bored with TV.  Your parents hogging it up, watching their shit.  Of course.  That's all right.  Yeah, we'd go outside and just turn on the CB radio.  Wow.  That's how I met the Dreamweaver, dude.  Come on.  Of course.  Oh, really?  Yeah, met her on the CB.  I had a much better handle than Anthony.  Oh, God.  His was the faggiest. 
[01:30:30]  Come on.  Wait, what was it?  I think it was Apple Tree Boy.  No, not quite.  What was it?  We did this break.  I don't remember.  I might not have been here.  I listened to it like a best of.  You'll find out.  No, what was it?  I probably was away.  I might have been on the road.  Oh, no.  You got it.  Oh, boy.  You think the Wrangler's bad.  Very good.  You think the Wrangler's bad.  People know.  See, people know.  Jimmy, you don't pay attention.  I was probably gone.  You need to pay more attention.  Closer attention.  I don't know if Jimmy was even when we first started talking about it.  Well, I was 11, maybe 12, maybe. 
[01:31:00]  And my CB handle was, I can't believe I'm about to do this.  People know.  Yeah, I know.  Jimmy's not going to make fun.  You promise you're not going to make fun, Jimmy?  Yes.  You sure?  You were 11.  Yeah.  I was 11.  Remember that.  Okay.  Diamond.  No, it wasn't Diamond. 
[01:31:30]  No?  You're leaving part out.  And then you decide which is a faggier handle.  That's your job today.  But don't make fun.  You promise.  Yeah, I won't.  Diamond.  Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust was his.  Sounds like a stripper's name.  Diamond Dust.  Look at his face.  I know.  Diamond Dust.  CB was the friggin' internet back then.  It was the internet.  That's all you had. 
[01:32:00]  It was Twitter.  Jimmy, you promised.  I wouldn't make...  You promised.  Who wouldn't want a handful of Diamond Dust to sprinkle about?  Diamond Dust.  I would love to have a handful of Diamond Dust.  That's what I thought of myself.  I wanted diamonds, but I knew I was only good enough for the dust part.  Breaker Breaker.  After they made their nice stones.  Yes, Breaker Breaker.  Diamond Dust here on the corner of 7th and Christopher.  I was 11.  Come on.  Diamond Dust.  I didn't even have pubic hair yet.  You got your ears on? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Diamond Dust.  You got your brown panties on?  Diamond Dust.  Oh, how bad is that?  That's pretty bad.  Yeah.  Because that's what...  I don't even know why, to be honest.  An 11-year-old would think that's cool.  I forgot what that's based on.  I don't even know.  I don't remember why I came up with that dumb name, but I certainly did.  An 11-year-old would think that's cool.  That's all it is.  When you're 11, you think that's cool.  Diamond Dust.  It sounds like mysterious.  You're not just, man.  You could beat the shit out of me.  No, believe me.  I'm just being honest. 
[01:33:00]  Diamond Dust is rough.  It's terrible.  Wrangler's not much better.  No, it's so awful.  Well, Wrangler was...  At least it had a reason, you know.  I was the Wrangler.  It's a rump variety.  No.  I wasn't a rump.  There is a reason you were a fucking...  It didn't put rump in there.  Taking loads in your rectum.  It's a perfect reason.  I never...  Catcher would have been great, and so would Swallower.  A little Crab Baby Cock Sucker, you got your ears on?  Crab Baby Cock Sucker, you got your ears on?  That would have been more appropriate.  Yeah.  Well, now they're coming up with CB names for us, which is awesome. 
[01:33:30]  Jordan writes, Breaker19.  This is the Blue Comb Kid.  I should have embraced that.  Yeah.  I should have been the Blue Comb Kid.  Yeah, Breaker19, this is the Tree Fort Cocksucker.  Tree Fort Cocksucker coming in.  Tree Fort Cocksucker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go on.  Oh, download Blowjob.  Download Blowjob.  Are you on the air?  Oh, my God.  You never had a CB handle, did you?  No, I didn't.  Why, man?  Why would I? 
[01:34:00]  I didn't have a CB.  Oh, he was too busy with the Lords.  Exactly.  Hang out with his gang, the Lords.  Breaker19, this is the literal Blowjob Giver.  This is the literal Blowjob Giver.  It's all gay stuff.  Gay stuff's always funny.  Big Daddy James could have been a nice CB.  Yeah, there's Breaker19, this is Big Daddy James, word is Bond, fat laces.  I'm out.  Yeah.  CB was a very big thing back in the 70s.  Hey, the Glen Campbell song could have been I Will Remember You, by the way, E-Rock. 
[01:34:30]  That would have been clever.  Oh, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Instead of just playing a Glen Campbell song.  Mm-hmm.  You want to still do that, or are we moving on from that?  It's not in here.  No, it's okay.  You don't have to play it.  Like a rhinestone cowboy.  Bam, bam.  Breaker, breaker.  This is Diamond Dust.  It's knowing that your floor is always open and your path is free to stand on your head.  See, he's crazy now. 
[01:35:00]  He has Alzheimer's.  You want to go more CB talk?  Because one guy is willing to admit his CB handle was Howdy Doody.  And then you got Carlos in Jersey.  Carlos.  Carlos.  What's up, boys?  Hello.  Hi.  I'm a trucker.  Everybody's got a CB.  And one time I had it on, just bullshitting.  It's the most racist thing on the line, too.  It's funny as hell.  Then a cop gets on the channel, tells us that there's like a black Nissan caused an accident.  So all the truckers, I'm on the turnpike in Jersey. 
[01:35:30]  And then we line up on the three lanes, like riding together.  And then another guy gets like on the side.  And then the car is trying to get around.  And we're fucking all swerving.  Wow.  You got you a convoy.  Hey, got your ears on, son?  Yes, son.  Let's play convoy.  Yeah, breaker one nine.  This here's a rubber duck.  A rubber duck.  Copy on me, big fan.  Come on.  This was very dramatic.  Yeah, 10-4, big fan.  Turn this up.  Sure.  By golly, it's clean.  Clear to flag town. 
[01:36:00]  Come on.  Such a Jewish chill.  You don't like this?  Yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy.  This love almost comes together.  We got ourselves a gun.  Convoy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a dark of the moon on the 6th of June in a Kenworth pulling logs.  Cab over Pete with a reefer on and a Jimmy hauling logs.  This is somebody who really wanted to be Johnny Cash, but wasn't.  It was not even close.  Knows a lot about trucks, though.  Is this a song done for a morning show? 
[01:36:30]  No.  This is...  You sure?  This is a movie.  With Chris Christopherson.  Yes.  Yeah, but I think the movie is based on the song.  Look at the fucking poster for it.  A shirtless Chris Christopherson.  All buff.  Who's...  Who's...  And who's the broad?  Yeah.  Who's that?  Looks like...  Let me see the broad.  Oh, that was at Ali McGraw.  Ali McGraw, yeah.  In her Afro stage.  This used to be fucking rock. 
[01:37:00]  Sam Peckinpah did Convoy?  Why is he shirtless in the poster?  Because look at his abs.  Do you think he looked at that poster and just went,  Oh my God, I look nothing like that.  Cloverleaf and them bears was wall to wall.  Them bears was wall to wall.  They even had a bear in the air.  Oh, really?  This is calling all trucks as here's the duck.  We about to go hunting bear.  Ugh.  Yeah.  The Smokey and the Bandit songs were good.  This is fucking hideous.  What was bear again?  Cop.  That was your copper. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  Yes.  We got a Kojak with a Kodak.  That was a cop with a radar gun.  A Kojak with a Kodak.  Yeah.  Hey.  This is...  Well, we rolled up Interstate 44 like a rocket sled on rails.  We tore up all of our swindle sheets and left them sitting on the scale.  By the time we hit that Chi-Town, them bears was getting smart. 
[01:38:00]  They'd brought up some reinforcements from the Illinois National Guard.  Can you pause this song?  There's an armored car.  Yeah, you're not...  What's the problem here?  I don't know.  A bunch of trucks going.  What's the problem here?  Ah, the cops are hot on their trail.  For what reason?  Exactly.  I have no idea.  Someone break this song down.  Yeah, we're hauling paper.  We got too much.  It's kind of heavy.  What do you got?  I've heard this song a million times.  I got to break it.  What's the problem?  I don't know.  Why is there a bear in the air? 
[01:38:30]  What's going on?  It's a maverick convoy.  There's something happening.  We're all doing 57 instead of 55 bears trying to get it.  Yeah, we got a bunch of stuff in the back of the truck.  My tire pressure was two pounds low.  So the convoy was real legal?  I don't know.  What's the problem in this song?  I got a little white in my beard.  My girl's got hair like Juan Epstein.  That is horrible.  Are they hauling crystal meth?  What's the problem here?  I don't know what was happening.  All right, go back. 
[01:39:00]  Let's see if we can figure out the problem.  The bears are in the air.  The cops are all chasing the big convoy because it's kind of hard to find 400 tractor trailers.  But now they're ripping up their paperwork.  They're becoming rebels.  And we're leaving it on the scale.  Yeah, they're bypassing the scales.  Are they?  It's crazy.  What against the system?  But what happened?  I don't know.  Let's go back to the song.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  I'm so frustrated.  We got 4,000 pounds of kiddie porn on a pallet in the back truck.  A little bunch of Asian boys with large white genitals in the mouths.  We've got to get it to California. 
[01:39:30]  They've brought up some reinforcements from the Illinois National Guard.  There's armored cars, tanks, jeeps, and rigs of every size.  Uh-oh.  What's going on?  Yeah, them chicken coops was full of bears, and choppers filled the skies.  Well, we shot the line we went for broke with 1,000 screaming trucks.  Why?  And 11 long-haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse microbus.  Hippies.  Hey, a rubber duck to a sod buster.  Come on there.  Yeah, 10-4 sod buster. 
[01:40:00]  Listen, you want to put that microbus in behind that suicide jockey?  Yeah, he's hauling dynamite, and he needs all the help he can get.  Oh.  Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey Shore, prepared to cross the line.  I could see the bridge was lined with bears, but it didn't have a doggone dime.  I says, pig pen, this here's a rubber duck.  We just ain't going to pay no toll.  So we crashed the gate doing 98.  I says, let them truckers roll 10-4.  I stopped to see it.  You don't like that?  No, this is terrible. 
[01:40:30]  What's going on?  I don't know.  We've got to get to the Jersey Shore because we're holding flip-flops for the kids.  Maybe they just did all their crystal meth before they left.  But do they expect to get away with this?  I don't know.  What are they doing?  Why not just pay the toll?  Right.  Why are you crashing the gate at 98?  What is going on?  Oh, my God.  The trailer looks really good.  That's not the trailer.  What is it?  The whole movie?  You found the whole movie?  The whole movie's two minutes long?  I like the Sam Peckinboss slow motion bar fight that's going on. 
[01:41:00]  Well, he was known for that, wasn't he?  Oh, yeah.  He was known for the fights.  Hey, was that...  Is that fucking Paulie from...  From Rocky?  Rocky.  He was in this fucking movie.  It's a little Burt Young.  Burt Young.  Burt Young, thank you.  Yes.  Wow.  Can someone explain what this fucking song is?  Ernest Borgnine.  Wow.  Oh, it was one of those films where they got all the stars.  Yeah, like Cannonball Run.  Yeah.  Yeah, they got everybody.  This is awful, man. 
[01:41:30]  Oof.  I can't watch this.  It's too chilly.  We're going to have to break because we've got Elijah Wood coming in.  Yes.  We're going to do a quick break.  Do a single?  Yeah, because he's here in the middle of this.  But someone, don't forget, I want you to explain this Convoy song.  Yeah, I want to know what the problem was.  Because we're not done with this.  I want to know what the fucking issue was that they sang about it.  Yeah.  And did they get away with it in the end?  Someone's saying that speeding was a big problem with truckers in the 70s.  Uh-huh. 
[01:42:00]  So what does that mean?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Truckers out there know the reason for this song.  So call us after Elijah Wood so we can go back to this, okay?  All right.  But next, Elijah Wood.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest  we couldn't get. 
[01:42:30]  Star of film and television, Robin Hood star, Christian Slater.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Christian Slater.  Christian, do you watch Top Chef?  No.  Thank you so much for your time.  My pleasure.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on  the Opie and Anthony Show.  If you've got nothing better to do right now, why don't you call the show?  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969. 
[01:43:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are we back?  We're back.  Oh, man.  Here we go.  We've got Elijah Wood outside the studio.  Bring him in.  Elijah.  Just met him literally a minute ago.  What's up?  How are you, sir?  I'm doing very well.  Yeah.  Busy?  Have they got you all over the place?  Not so bad.  Really?  Not too bad?  No, not so bad.  You've got to be used to this by now.  Yeah.  Jesus.  He's like, yeah.  Yeah, a little bit.  We were just, what were we just watching? 
[01:43:30]  That's Jimmy, Opie, Anthony.  That's me.  We were watching.  Travis.  Don't dump him.  What's up, Travis?  I like the way he looked at Travis, and you only introduced Travis out of obligation,  which I kind of like.  Because he was in the line of view.  It's like, ah.  I know we're going to talk about Wilford.  Are you the whipping boy, Travis?  I don't know.  Okay.  I'm getting the order of.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to talk about Wilford in a second.  Yeah.  It's on, premieres tonight at 10 p.m. on FX, and we saw it, but quickly, we were just  talking about you coming in and stuff, and we saw a scene from The Good Son. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  We forgot you were in that.  Yeah.  Because you've been around forever.  Yeah.  And you were Macaulay Culkin's brother in that, right?  The victim.  Cousin, I think.  Cousin or something?  The victim.  Yeah.  That was horrible.  And you guys are throwing the dummy over the overpass.  That's brutal, man.  It's so brutal.  It was a real, like, brutal movie.  It's kind of an intense scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, it's all, like, small stuff right before that, and then they throw the body over,  and you're like, whoa.  Yeah.  And Macaulay's all, like, into it and everything. 
[01:44:30]  Really.  Because it goes from smoking cigarettes to creating car accidents.  Yeah.  Stuff that a lot of us can relate to, maybe throwing snowballs at cars or something.  Or shooting bolt guns.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, you're throwing a dummy into traffic.  What the hell?  How did you make that transition from, like, really, you were a child, child actor into,  you know, you're doing roles now.  They're adult roles.  Yeah.  You have been for a while now.  Do you remember when that transition happened, or did it seem natural, or was it like, hey,  look, I'm doing adult roles?  I don't know if it, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  I mean, it's just one of those things where I just continued to work.  So I don't know if there was, like, one film that did it, or if there were a series of  films that just suddenly were more adult.  Do you remember the first movie you did, though, where you were like, okay, I'm not really  playing, like, the little kid here.  Although even as a kid...  I would have said The Ice Storm would have been a transitional film.  Because that was like, it was a teenage role, but it was such a, the subject matter was so  adult.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  You know what it is with your whole career, too, though?  Even as a kid, you weren't playing, like, kid roles. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  They were, like, some of those movies.  Radio Flyer was insanely intense to watch.  Yeah.  That movie.  You know, that was one of those, like, holy Jesus, this one's...  Yeah.  There was always some sort of maturity to the, either the subject matter to the characters.  Yeah, except maybe Back to the Future, too.  Right.  Okay.  That one, just a kid playing a game.  Right.  Love that one.  It's like, hey, look, there he is.  Playing a video game.  That was the first movie I was ever in.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, that was...  What was that?  What year was it?  God, in 89?  Was it?  Yeah, probably 89.  Something like that.  Yeah, to have a start.  Yeah, I know, right?  Jesus.  Yeah, that's a good one.  It was so awesome, because I had to get that.  Spielberg, see, and just go.  Ah, yeah, he fits the bill for a Spielberg kid.  I just auditioned.  It was the tiniest little role, so I just auditioned for it.  Yeah, it was nuts being on that set, like, having seen the original film, and then being  there in the future.  Like, it was blowing...  It blew my mind.  Like, I don't even know how I could process that.  It was so awesome.  What'd you do?  Like, just start doing commercials, I guess? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  As a...  What was the first one?  Mm...  My very first job was a Paula Abdul music video.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  It was for Forever Your Girl.  You rock.  You rock.  You rock.  You love Paula Abdul.  Yeah, he's a big, uh...  The guy in the booth.  No, he's right here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's over here today.  Hey, what's up?  I didn't see him in the studio.  Do you remember him in Paula Abdul's video?  Now that he said it, yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was that Black and White video.  David Fincher, funnily enough, directed that.  Wow.  Before he started making movies. 
[01:47:00]  Eric's very strange.  He likes Paula Abdul and Weird Al Yankovic.  That's his music.  That's your jam?  Those are your jams?  That's his jam.  You get in the car for a road trip and it's a...  Making mixtapes for chicks.  Right now on there.  Cool-hearted snake style.  Good for Elijah, beating him up.  Yeah, exactly.  Even he hates you.  Trust me, he deserves it.  So, doing TV, that's kind of new, though, for you, right?  Totally. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And from what I've heard from actors, it is a totally different vibe doing it.  Do you like it?  Yeah.  I mean, the pace is so much faster.  Yeah.  We shot 13 episodes in 10 weeks.  We were doing like 8 to 10 pages a day.  Some is like as many as 6 or 7 scenes a day.  It was a lot.  It was just a faster pace.  That was like one...  The whole thing is like one...  It takes the time of one take in Lord of the Rings, I'm sure.  Right.  It was just like as long as it takes to do an entire series.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Much different pacing. 
[01:48:00]  We should talk about Wilford, though.  You want to tell the people what it's about?  Yeah.  It's a weird show.  Yeah.  It really is.  It is.  It's a weird show, and it's not easily defined.  I mean, it's essentially about a guy who befriends his neighbor's dog, but he sees the  dog as a man in a dog suit.  And we find my character, Ryan, in a moment of crisis.  He's essentially trying to commit suicide.  Hilarious.  And he fails and wakes up the next morning, or doesn't wake up. 
[01:48:30]  He's going to go to sleep.  And he gets a knock on his door from his neighbor, and his neighbor's like, can you look after  my dog?  Reveal man in dog suit.  And sort of from there on out, you know, he spends the next day trying to figure out what  the hell's going on.  And then ultimately, at the end of the episode, sort of accepts this person dog in his life  and recognizes that nobody else sees him, only he does.  And it's going to be some kind of coping mechanism for him.  But everybody recognizes the dog as a dog. 
[01:49:00]  As a dog.  It's not an invisible friend.  It really is.  People, chicks react to it like a dog.  Yes.  And the guy, the dog is just a pig, which is great.  Does exactly what he does.  He puts his face in tits.  I mean, there's some really funny scenes.  Yeah, the scene with the waitress is hilarious.  Yeah.  And there's one scene, I don't remember what I saw.  I watched all three.  Yeah, yeah.  The dog's always stoned.  I like the fact they're showing that on FX.  The dog is always high.  The language is great.  You don't miss the word fuck.  You don't realize it.  It just feels like an HBO show.  Yeah.  With the language.  And the dog is really... 
[01:49:30]  What is he fucking, the big stuffed animal in one of them?  It's hilarious.  Because he keeps turning the stuffed animal...  There's so much more of that as the series goes.  He develops a very intense relationship with that stuffed animal called Claire.  Yeah, I think that made me...  I was watching it last night.  I got my thing late.  You're on cum stains on the...  Yeah.  He's talking about how much he likes eating out the asshole of a possum.  Yeah.  There's some really funny things.  You kind of love FX, man.  Yeah.  That's why they're kicking ass on the networks and everything. 
[01:50:00]  Because it's real language.  You don't have to sit there and go, oh, really?  You're spoon-feeding this to the children?  And they take risks.  I mean, the concept of the show is strange.  It's weird.  It's very surreal.  It's not easily defined.  And, you know, they gave us full creative control to make the show we wanted to make  and not have to pander it to an audience to explain too much.  Because we don't explain a lot.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like, why has this happened?  It's like, whatever.  Never explain it.  We're hoping for...  Deal with it, yeah.  Me and Jimmy are hoping for some kind of reveal eventually. 
[01:50:30]  I'm sure it'll happen.  As time goes on, you'll learn more.  But I feel like there's something we don't know.  Yeah.  And you get that feeling watching it, like there is more to this.  There's something deeper going on here.  And he obviously wants to hook up with the dog's owner, who's this beautiful girl.  Right.  And the dog is kind of cock-blocking, which is great.  It's very funny.  The cock-blocks the dog throws.  That's actually how the whole thing started.  Jason Gann, who created the character of Wilfred, initially started as a short film.  And he was stoned with a friend of his. 
[01:51:00]  And they were talking about how their female friend had a dog that was cock-blocking her  like prospective boyfriends and like giving the boyfriend shit.  And so he created this sort of humanized version of that dog, what Wilfred stoned.  And they're like, wait, this is a really good idea for a short film.  Well, there's one scene, I don't want to give away punchlines, but there's a very funny  scene where the dog tells his character that she has a flaw.  And he's like, I don't want to say where it is.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:51:30]  The dog says...  The dog's an asshole.  I'll say, it's only one line in one of the episodes.  But the dog says...  The dog is getting anesthesia or whatever.  And he goes, she's passing out.  He's passing out.  And the dog says, she has a dick.  And then passes out.  It's fucking funny, man.  It was really great.  They didn't soften it up and make it dog dialogue.  The dog is like really an asshole friend who does dog things.  And you only remember he's a dog when he talks about chewing the asshole out of a possum or 
[01:52:00]  he's humping somebody or somebody's reacting and petting him.  There's a very funny scene where he takes the dog to the beach and the dog's just being  a total douche on the beach.  There's a lot of really, really funny, funny scenes.  And it is bizarre.  So it's engaging to watch because you're like, you don't understand what this relationship  is, but it's funny.  How'd you get into this?  I read the script.  I was sent the script.  I was reading a couple of different television scripts, just kind of interested in television.  It's changed so much, you know, in the last five years.  It's definitely more acceptable and accepted to get into. 
[01:52:30]  It's that.  And it's also some incredible directors and writers and actors have moved to television.  And it's, it's an interesting medium now for storytelling in some ways, you know, more  consistent than film in a way.  And so I was just interested to see what was available.  I'd never really taken a look at it.  And this was one of the scripts that I read.  And a lot of, it seems like the funniest thing I'd ever read, really.  A lot of, like you just said, a lot of people that probably would have been shut out of TV  15 years ago because NBC, CBS, ABC or whatever, the few networks use these writers in the 
[01:53:00]  same fucking cornball, uh, you know, beginning, middle and end to an episode.  And now all these creative people have other outlets that you couldn't, you might be able  to do the show on a network, but it wouldn't be as funny because half the jokes wouldn't  be able to play.  Yeah, you're totally right.  They would have to cuten it up.  It would be so initiatized, you know?  Yeah.  The suicide attempt, they would be like, I don't know if we should.  It's too dark.  Yeah, it's too dark.  And we don't want to show sadness.  And we don't want to offend people.  Right.  Because, you know, making mockery of him taking a bunch of pills. 
[01:53:30]  And it's just great.  It's just great.  His fucking sister's annoying and always yelling at him.  But it's kind of hot and fucking, yeah.  His neighbor's a fucking complete, it's a very funny scene where he hangs out with  the neighbor and they porn out to watch hardcore porn again.  It's some funny shit, man.  Fucking, it's a really kind of a weird homoerotic relationship with the neighbor.  But the neighbor's not gay.  He's just creepy and fucking invasive.  Yeah, there's a lot of very, very funny, uh, funny things with the, uh, but the dog just  sets him up to get fucked every time.  Um, metaphorically, you know, the dog sets him up to have problems. 
[01:54:00]  It's like a really weird, aggressive relationship.  Like, the dog loves him, but also wants to see him just be ruined.  Just fail.  Yeah.  Like, the dog talks him into shitting into the neighbor's boots.  There's a lot of very, very funny things.  I won't give any more away, but you gotta, it's worth watching.  It's a very, it's a very strange show, Elijah.  Dude, they did that in the fucking, in the, in the, in the pilot episode where the dog  shits in the neighbor's boots and he's like, well, come on, there's one more.  And he talks him into shitting into the neighbor's boot.  Like, what a great thing to put in a fucking pilot.  And Elijah's character enjoyed it. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  He was very happy.  The dog kind of frees him in a way from being this, uh, this really sad guy.  The dog is kind of a balance.  Well, see, that's, that's the whole point behind any of those things.  Like, there are these, these ridiculous scenarios that Wilford tries to put him into that are  seemingly harmful to the character.  But ultimately what they're about is getting Ryan to live outside of his comfort zone.  Cause he's, what, what led him to suicide was essentially like living a path that was  not his own.  His sister told him what to do.  His dad told him what to do. 
[01:55:00]  And he ceased to like follow his own path.  Right.  And Wilford's like, fuck that.  Shit in the boot.  Yeah.  Basically.  Steal the guy's pot.  You know, the guy had a big pot plant.  But a lot of drug jokes.  Like, you know, I like the fact that they're smoking pot and it's like, they're not sanitizing  it like.  No.  Yeah.  At all.  And that to me is what, and it's on right before Louie.  So it's like, people are going to tune into Louie at 1030.  I mean, tune in a half hour earlier and watch both shows.  FX has a great.  Louie's show is incredible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is very good.  It's fucking, you know, he's brilliant.  I mean.  Incredible. 
[01:55:30]  I mean, that last, that first season, it was so interesting cause it sort of found its  legs three or four episodes in.  Yeah.  And just became something wholly onto its own, like indescribable, nothing like it on television.  Yeah.  And this new season, I saw the first episode from the new season and it's fucking incredible.  Yeah.  Well, that's what makes FX great is they let Louie, cause he knows what he's doing.  He has full control on the show.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Right?  But he was ready to walk.  He's like, nah, I'm not interested in doing it that way.  I want to do it this way.  And they gave it to him.  Yeah.  They're like, he wants to edit, direct, write, everything.  He's literally writing it as he goes along. 
[01:56:00]  He doesn't have to, he doesn't have to submit scripts.  We know, we know Louie pretty well.  It's amazing.  I know.  He's in a lot.  Yeah.  He's a great guy.  He's got photos of, uh, FX, uh, executives.  Absolutely.  What's that?  He wouldn't even show the executives the finished product.  No.  He goes, don't you worry, I will deliver and then you'll see it for the first time.  It's a real credit to FX.  They decided to go for it.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  And the fact is, and they said, you know, it's not a tremendously expensive show to do.  That's why Louie, you know, there's so much money wasted in television and the fact  that Louie knows how to do well.  He's been doing home movies, like, uh, these little shorts for you at the comic strip parties 
[01:56:30]  fucking 15 years ago.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he'd be showing these little weird, uh, videos he made.  Louie was always the guy doing that.  And, uh, nice.  It pays off.  Yeah.  He certainly did for him.  Yeah.  He's so funny.  Easily, I think, one of the best stand-ups in the record.  Yeah, he's great.  He's absolutely great.  Extraordinary.  I want to ask you about, uh, uh, doing Lord of the Rings.  Uh, it took, how many years to, to film all those?  Uh, it was the, it was four years?  Four years.  Yeah.  Now, you were pretty much.  60 months of, like, actual being in New Zealand for, like, a block of time. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, that, that's a lot of time.  Now, obviously, it worked out pretty well.  I mean, very successful, uh, movies.  Um, would you ever commit to that much time again?  Because it seems like a lot of career time.  And, and it is kind of a gamble, not knowing if it's going to pay off.  Uh, but, you know, you're, you're out of the loop for a while.  Yeah.  It was never anything I, I was worried about or considered.  I mean, I think, I, I recognized the fact that, that they were essentially setting out 
[01:57:30]  to, to make The Lord of the Rings, which is an incredible series of books, um, and it  was going to be unprecedented.  And the fact that Peter Jackson was directing it, I never kind of, I never really thought  twice about it.  Really?  It was such an incredible opportunity.  I knew, regardless of how it ended up being received and turned out, I knew it was going  to be a unique experience for me and a sort of defining experience either way.  And it turned out to be fantastic.  Amazing, yeah. 
[01:58:00]  And the films are great.  Um, but it was just, I was 18 at the time and it was the, the most incredible opportunity  I'd ever had.  So it was just, there was no question in my mind that it was something that I, now would  I, would I take a similar kind of, it really depends.  I think it would depend on the filmmaker and, and ultimately what the material is, but that  was a very special circumstance.  Not like a four years on doing like Smokey and the Bandit 4.  No.  You'd say like, no.  No. 
[01:58:30]  But it was a special circumstance, you know, the whole thing felt extremely unique and,  and like being given an opportunity to, to take an adventure, you know.  When I watched, uh, cause I watched every bit of the DVDs, the making of all the behind  the scenes stuff with Weta and everything.  A lot of footage there.  Oh my God.  I was like, all right already, Anthony, what are you doing?  I'm like, ah, I'm almost done.  Another three DVDs and I'm done.  But, uh, just an amazing, uh, amount of work that went into that. 
[01:59:00]  Uh, and, and it really is the only way it could have come out that way.  Yeah.  When you look at a, a, a book like that or a series of books like that and realize somebody's  going to try to make a movie out of it, you really got to go, yeah, cause that, it seems  impossible.  But, uh, yeah, he really pulled that off amazingly.  Yeah.  It was a pretty extraordinary feat.  You know, when you, when you consider how many people were involved in the making of it  too, and like the, the, the ultimate collective effort it took, it was just mind blowing.  Like down to the guy, like making the chain mail, like sitting in a room. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  That, that's it.  Like all the authentic, uh, costumes that went into it and real blacksmiths that made  the swords and everything.  Yeah.  He really wanted that.  It was a sort of Herculean effort, but it also felt like it couldn't have been done anywhere  else.  And I think we were all very aware of that at the time.  Like if it would have been done in the United States, it probably would have been double  the money and the atmosphere surrounding it wouldn't have felt the same. 
[02:00:00]  It really felt like a family effort.  Even though it was this massive film, it's so funny talking to people about it.  Cause they're like, you know, you're used to huge films.  Like, yeah, it was huge, but it also felt like the world's largest independent film.  It was, it was very much a local family effort in this small country.  And we felt very tucked away from Hollywood and the rest of the world in our own little  world, making this, you know, middle earth come to life.  Did you spend a lot of time with them?  Did you see the Maoris?  I'm sure when you were there, right?  Oh yeah. 
[02:00:30]  It's a, you ever see Once for Warriors?  Oh dude, that movie's incredible.  It's fucking amazing, right?  Amazing.  Great flick about New Zealand and the alcoholism and the, and the Maoris.  It's fucking.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that's about one family being broke.  But I always think of that when I think of New Zealand.  That's all I know about New Zealand.  So I just wanted to interrupt with my bit of knowledge.  Bringing nothing to the conversation except just getting my voice on the radio.  It's a really powerful film.  Oh, fuck, man.  It's almost like the Native American experience here to a certain degree.  Yeah.  You know, he's a big soap star over there. 
[02:01:00]  The guy who played, uh, Jake the Muss.  Um, and there's certain things in the book that happened that, uh, he wouldn't do.  So they had to change it and put Uncle Bully in.  Interesting.  In the, in the, in the, well, you know, it's 1994.  I'm acting like big spoiler alert.  But, uh, you know, the fucking, the daughter is raped.  Um, 13, she's raped by the uncle.  But in the book, I think it's Jake who rips her.  But, uh.  Oh, wow.  All right.  I just figured I'd completely destroy the conversation.  I did enjoy Wilford a lot, though.  I did.  Yeah, Wilford's going to do all right. 
[02:01:30]  It's, well, conceptually, it's great.  Yes.  When's the last time you auditioned for anything?  Like, cause you, you know, you're obviously, they say, offer only.  I mean, you don't have to.  No, I, I still audition.  Do you really?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  I auditioned for something the other day.  God, that depresses me.  Cause I'm terrible on auditions.  Uh-huh.  And when I get it.  Auditions still make me really nervous.  I'm sure they make everybody else nervous, too, when he walks in.  Nah.  Fuck.  He came out for this?  Did you get a callback and he walks in?  Oh, man.  It's either me or Elijah.  Your name is Fred Bentley.  You're from Ohio. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  Whether it's good to Elijah or Fred Bentley.  I think I did pretty good.  Walks out.  I think I did.  Fred Bentley's good, man.  You gotta love Fred Bentley.  Check his IMDb.  It's great.  Yeah.  Wow.  All the roles he almost got.  That's odd that you still get nervous, though.  Oh, totally.  Totally.  I think I was also out of practice for a while because I wasn't auditioning as much.  Yeah.  And I'm sort of auditioning more now.  I mean, I think the atmosphere around film has changed a little bit.  And people are auditioning for things when they didn't necessarily used to have to. 
[02:02:30]  I think.  Wow.  I don't know what that's about, but.  Actually, I have to say, like, auditioning for something and feeling like you've genuinely  earned it, it means more.  It feels like an actual achievement.  Oh, that if you just get tossed the role because of who you are.  Totally.  Past work, yeah.  Totally.  How do they tell?  Is it awkward for them to ask you to read for something?  Like, you know, we know he'd probably be great, but we have to ask to, it is kind of asking  somebody to do something.  I shan't. 
[02:03:00]  A lot of guys will, I'm sure.  Yeah, I guess the only way I would know that is just the atmosphere of going in.  And oftentimes I will say, like, I'll do a reading and they'll be very thankful.  I'm like, no, thank you for having me.  It's not a big deal to come in.  I can't thank you enough for coming in.  I'm trying to get a job here.  It's my job.  Yeah.  That's what I'm supposed to do.  That's real fame right there.  Does your agent bring you stuff or will they say, look, we'd love Elijah to read for this?  Would he be willing to come in and read?  Do they send you, like, scripts and go, would he read? 
[02:03:30]  That's great.  Yeah.  Because my agent will call, my manager will call, do you want to go in and try, should  I try to get you in for this?  Ugh.  The last audition I did wasn't good.  Did you bomb?  Fucking horrible.  It was from, oh.  What happened?  It was, uh, well.  It's an awful feeling, isn't it?  It certainly is.  It was for the, uh.  You walk out and you're like, ah.  I just missed.  No.  It was for the Alec Baldwin, Meryl Streep movie, you know, which to me did not look appealing.  And the role that I was reading for, I was wrong for. 
[02:04:00]  But I was like, it's Meryl Streep.  You have to read.  It's like, but it was for the hotel doctor.  And I'm like, you fuck it.  To my manager.  I'm like, I'm not a hotel doctor.  You fucking.  And I go in and I'm so bad.  I'm just disastrous.  And the girl is sick.  I'm on.  It's on.  First of all, it's hard to get on camera, as you know.  It's harder if the producers are in the room.  But on camera is fucking horrible.  And I'm bombing.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  I wasn't even that good.  I would have been better if I went.  And I said, I'm like, I stopped.  I'm like, look, can we just restart this?  And she goes, no, no, no. 
[02:04:30]  Just keep going.  We'll piece it together.  Meaning, get the hell out.  Meaning, you've wasted enough of my time already.  But I couldn't even be mad at her because I was giving an abominable read.  She did what she should have done.  I was wasting her time.  Yeah, she let you off the hook.  She fucking ushered me out.  I was doing you a favor.  We can get you out of here.  Exactly.  Get you out of your mystery.  The Hotel Doctor.  Yeah, I never should have read for that.  I should have just said no.  Hey, I want to ask Elijah about Victoria Falls, which has nothing to do with acting and stuff. 
[02:05:00]  But you went across that in ropes?  Yes.  And you were the first person to do this?  Apparently.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  You remember Jack Osborne's show, Adrenaline Junkie?  I know.  He was on it and he did – it's a stunt, really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had that show, which I think he still does, where he basically has people go to different  parts of the world and they basically do sort of like adrenaline activities.  And then he asked me to come down to Africa.  This is an awesome – I've never been to Africa before.  And one of the activities that we did was they pulled a line across the Victoria Falls. 
[02:05:30]  It was a giant gorge.  And we basically harnessed ourselves in and pulled ourselves across.  Holy crap.  It was amazing.  How high up were you?  I don't actually remember.  But I mean like you weren't 20 feet off the line.  You were high.  I was high.  It was actually the part of the season there where there's – it's the lowest water.  Like the – it's not a tide, but the lowest amount of water coming off of the falls.  Oh, wow.  So we could actually stand on the falls. 
[02:06:00]  It was mind-blowing.  And pulling ourselves across – it wasn't harrowing in like a bungee jumping kind of way.  In fact, in some ways I wasn't even nervous.  It was adrenalizing, kind of pulling myself out there and just looking at the vista.  And I ended up just sitting there and taking photos the whole time.  Wow, you stopped in the middle and just took pictures?  That's cool.  Oh, man.  It was fucking awesome.  Then again, if you've seen Cliffhanger, there's no guarantees.  I mean fucking equipment breaks.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Great scene, right?  I think I'm far too trusting.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't even really consider those options.  Yeah.  Isn't that great when she's fucking hanging there and Stallone grabs her and there's a great shot of the canyon?  Oh, yeah.  Couldn't hold on.  I did a gorge swing, too.  Have you guys ever done a bungee jump or anything like that?  No, no.  No bungee jumping.  No.  Skydive.  My girlfriend and I fought because he's in Vegas.  We fought because I didn't want to go up into a 51-story glass elevator because I hate heights so much.  And she's like, just come on, do it.  I'm like, you go fucking take the elevator. 
[02:07:00]  I'll wait.  And this castrating, rotten monster just screamed at me until I took the elevator.  Fucking horrible.  So I don't know.  I never bungee.  It scares me.  I want to hear about the swing.  Of course.  Yeah.  So the gorge swing is like a bungee jump except you don't have, you're not on a bungee.  It's just a normal cable.  And I did it twice.  Once with Jack, we did a tandem jump, which it's like, it's intense enough on your own.  But when you've got double the weight, it's so much faster. 
[02:07:30]  And we did it backwards.  So you're not looking.  But the first time I did it, I'm standing and you're looking at this giant gorge in front of you.  And they tell you to jump.  And everything in your body is saying, nope, nope, this is death.  This means death.  And the free fall, I don't know how many seconds it is, but it feels like an eternity.  It is the most intense feeling and horrifyingly scary.  There it is. 
[02:08:00]  Is this actually you doing it?  There is footage of me doing it.  He's doing a handstand.  I didn't do that.  The handstand is going off.  That's unadvisable.  Oh, gorge jump is unadvisable.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, no way.  I would never do that.  Oh, wow.  What's it attached to?  Something going across to the middle?  Cable, yeah.  It's a cable.  So then what happens, why they call it a swing, is basically at the end, it goes taut.  And once it goes taut, it turns into this lovely little swing.  Which is a lot of hell to get to a very peaceful thing. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  And I immediately felt like I wanted to do it again.  And then I regretted it when I was back, facing my back to the gorge, doing it backwards.  Which is an absolute nightmare.  When you do that, do they lower you into the water when you're done?  Or do you get pulled back up?  There was no water below us.  It was just rocks.  But you go to the ground?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because going back up would scare me more.  Really?  Being pulled back up.  Yeah, because you're losing ground.  At least when you're falling, you're getting closer to the ground.  That would scare me more.  See, that's the most dangerous part, though. 
[02:09:00]  No, I know, but...  Closer to the ground part.  Yeah.  That's scary, man.  Yeah, it was scary.  We also did a two-and-a-half-day rafting trip down the Zambezi River, too.  With Jack?  Yeah.  Why does he do that?  Why does he just stay home and just talk to Ozzy all day?  That's what I would do.  That's all I would do is just talk to Ozzy.  Jimmy's a huge Ozzy fan.  Huge fan of Ozzy.  An adventurer.  Yeah.  We had Jack in here recently.  He's doing well.  Yeah, I don't know.  He is, isn't he?  Yeah, he is.  It's amazing.  Did you see the documentary?  So much.  What's that?  The documentary?  Did you see the...  He did one on his father, right? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  No, I haven't seen it.  It's fucking great.  Is it?  I mean, I'm a huge Sabbath fan.  Yeah, yeah, me too.  I'm fucking consummate Ozzy.  Jimmy's the biggest Sabbath fan.  No, but I wouldn't have brought it up unless you mentioned Jack.  But it's amazing.  A guy with such a great career, and by me and you, would take these chances to...  Well, he wants to live.  Yeah, I know.  It sounds like he likes a little adventure.  Just stay in front of the cameras all the time.  Right.  That's it.  No, no, I'm not saying you don't live and enjoy life, but I would never.  Did you get the bug for adventure filming in New Zealand? 
[02:10:00]  Because they're all about that.  They are.  They have a lot of bungee jumps and gorge swings and all that stuff.  I did some of that there, but I didn't do a bungee jump.  They also do...  You can jump out of planes and stuff there, too.  I didn't do a lot of that.  They have this thing down in Queenstown.  It's like a jet boat.  It's a very fast jet boat that they drive around in these sort of little rivers.  And it's very frightening, and you get very close to the rocks, like dangerously close. 
[02:10:30]  That sounds creepy.  Yeah.  I did that.  That's pretty awesome.  No, thank you.  No adventure for you.  No.  I like being out there, but nah, that's too fast.  I'm just...  Would you do that?  The jet boat in a river with the rocks flying by your face?  I'm a car guy.  I'll do things in cars, but I won't...  I did that in New Zealand.  There was a...  Yeah.  What is it where it's off-road?  With off-road racing?  What is that called?  Rally cars?  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  They do rally cars.  Like doing the Baja down in Mexico.  That kind of thing.  So I got to do a ride in a rally car, and that was the most intense experience.  Yeah.  Don't shake your kidneys out of you.  Well, dude, the thing that blew my mind was how much control they have, but how it feels  like you're out of control the entire day.  Yeah.  Like you're...  It's all about the skid, and we were near the edge of cliffs, and the guy had control,  but it literally felt like it was constantly just out of control. 
[02:11:30]  I'm sure if you got behind the wheel, it wouldn't be as in control.  That's how I was feeling.  That is correct.  That's how I felt.  Yeah.  I did the NASCAR thing over at Pocono Raceway, where you go around with an instructor and kind  of get the feel of the car, and then they put you in the driver's seat, and you take  one out at like 140 miles an hour, 150.  And when you're with the guy and you're in the passenger seat, you're kind of like, wow,  this thing does stick to the road really well. 
[02:12:00]  Like he's going around these curves just flying.  Yeah.  And then you get in the car yourself, and like I said, everything tells you, I'm not supposed  to cut the wheel going this fast.  Yeah.  And you do it and realize, oh, yeah, this does kind of stick.  Like, then you've got to come out right next to the wall.  That stuff, though, I love doing.  That's fun for me.  But I would never parachute.  I would never bungee jump.  But something like that, I love it.  Dude, that sounds awesome.  It was so cool.  I would love to have an opportunity to do something.  Oh, Pocono Raceway.  What were we talking about yesterday?  In Vegas?  Oh, I was just thinking that. 
[02:12:30]  My ex did it.  We went to Vegas.  Oh, yeah, you were petrified again.  I wouldn't do it.  A little scared Jimmy.  I really am.  But my race car driving is, you know, I don't wear condoms.  I mean, we all have our thing.  Come on, healthy.  Death defying.  Exactly.  Whatever it is, it works.  We went to the stratosphere in Vegas where you fall. 
[02:13:00]  I imagine you would do it.  I think Elijah would do it, yeah.  I don't think it's as scary as what he's already done.  It's a decelerator.  Yeah, they use a decelerator.  You see this, right, Elijah?  Would you do that?  Would you jump probably about a 900-foot drop where they just kind of lower you off the  stratosphere?  Yeah.  You would do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, so he sounds awesome.  He's probably been in decelerators and rigging and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't really scare me.  That would horrify me from that.  It wouldn't scare me if it was like a certain height.  Did you do that?  No.  My girlfriend did. 
[02:13:30]  Oh.  No.  Again, the castrating.  His girlfriend does all the manly stuff.  Yeah, she wanted.  No, she knew I wouldn't do it.  She knew not to ask.  She's lucky I paid for her to do it.  But no, the elevator was the thing I did.  I was like, brave boy in the elevator.  The elevator.  The glass elevator at the Rio.  We saw Penn and Teller.  Fucking total pussy.  I am humiliating.  What is this ride?  At least you can own up to it.  I know.  I'm aware of that.  By the way, that's where you go.  Yeah, she did that too.  What is that?  It's where they just hold you over the edge and they drop you. 
[02:14:00]  What?  She said it wasn't that scary.  Oh, that's over the edge of a...  Stratosphere.  Stratosphere, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  It's horrifying.  What a strange place Vegas is.  Yeah.  It really is just an odd place.  It is such an odd place.  I was just there for the Beatles, the love show, their fifth anniversary.  And I actually got to DJ the event after.  But I hadn't been to Vegas in a long time.  And I hadn't really spent time there as an adult.  Yeah.  It was a very odd...  It's such an odd city.  Weird mix. 
[02:14:30]  Like, there's kids there.  There's so much ingrained sadness.  Yeah.  Like, it's such sadness.  You know, like, five in the morning, you're walking around and there are old women smoking,  sitting there at the fucking slot machines.  Yeah, the slot machines just hoping for the big win.  Oh, my God.  You ever take the ride two blocks off the Strip?  You want to see real sadness?  I'm sure.  At the old Strip?  Not even, man.  Like, the actual town of Las Vegas?  Oh, yeah.  A mere two blocks away. 
[02:15:00]  It is really sad.  I'm sure.  With the horrible motels and...  Well, the whole city sort of survives on the fact that it's all about...  Losing your people.  Losing your house.  And it's a city built on hotels and gambling and attractions.  So people have to lose for them to sustain the city.  So there's just, like you said, this underlying sadness.  Dude, and they come in droves and it feels like a lot of it's middle America and European  tourists and, ah, it's just a bummer.  Just hoping to make that big one and forget about their problems. 
[02:15:30]  And in the midst of it, there are these Cirque du Soleil shows.  Yes.  It's so weird.  It really is built on misery.  It's a show that...  I mean, it's a place that can be enjoyed for sure.  And I think like 36 to 48 hours, go to some great shows, have some great dinners, and  get the hell out.  Do you gamble?  I don't gamble at all.  I don't go to work.  So I have fun in Vegas because I don't gamble.  I'll buy 200 bucks in the week on video poker.  You gotta gamble a little.  I would...  Yeah.  I didn't do it when I was there.  I would love to. 
[02:16:00]  Like, I've never done blackjack at a table or poker at a table.  That would be awesome.  Yeah.  It's hard to stop.  I'd want to be able to play with somebody that knows what they're doing.  This guy does.  Ah, it's fun.  You play?  Yeah.  He's, uh...  Yeah.  When I'm at casinos.  That's fun.  The thing is, I don't...  That's cool.  I don't like making a point to go to casinos just to gamble.  I go there, like, if Jimmy's playing at one of the, you know, casinos, I'll go or, you  know, a concert's on that I want to see.  And then I'll go and I'll gamble and do that.  But, uh...  High roller. 
[02:16:30]  To jump in a car and just go, ah, I want to gamble.  Or...  I'd be broke.  But when you're there, when you're there, you're all in.  He's in the high roller section.  If I say, if you're going, you go.  He spits on the floor and they allow him to return.  Like, that doesn't matter how much he's gambling.  He has a pillow that he gets to scream into.  Yeah.  I was being much too loud when I...  I think he's being a little too polite.  I was discussing this with you.  And my buddy Keith, he's a cop here in New York.  He usually...  He's my security guy.  Nice.  And he grabbed a pillow and he's just like, eh, here. 
[02:17:00]  Because I would lean over sometimes and punch him.  I go, fuck it, a 21 dealer!  What is that crap?  You can't win with a 20 at this table?  20's not good enough at this table.  Like, that's me.  I'm just going nuts.  It's a sickness.  It's a good time.  And every codependent around him is like, go ahead, please, just win.  Please win.  So we don't have to pay for our own dinner.  Please.  We have to get a lot...  He has to rap, so...  Yeah, we are.  We want to get the plugs out, too.  A busy guy.  You can follow him on Twitter. 
[02:17:30]  It's at Wood Elijah.  One word.  E-L-I-J-A-H.  Wood Elijah is the word.  Oh, cool.  And Wilfred, I really enjoyed this.  I liked it, too, there, Elijah.  Thank you, man.  I think you got something here.  Premier's tonight.  I don't know you need us to tell you that, but...  What time tonight?  I think you're going to be a big star.  10 o'clock tonight on Netflix.  10 tonight.  Before Louie.  And there's some really, really fucking edgy stuff in it.  And I love where they went with a lot of the jokes.  There's nothing cutesy about it.  And for shitting in the boots, they won me immediately with a shit in the boot moment. 
[02:18:00]  Very funny.  You can always score high points with shit in the boot.  You can, though, because you don't see...  That's why I've seen the pilot, man.  I've never seen that in a show before.  It was fucking funny, and it was aggressive, and I liked it a lot.  I'm excited to see where the show goes.  You know, we did 13 episodes, and over the course of the season, it felt like the scripts  were getting better.  I love all the scripts, and they're very funny initially, but it started to open up conceptually  to play at a lot of other levels.  And I feel like what it becomes at the end of the season, I'm really excited for people 
[02:18:30]  to see where it goes.  I think that's what a show has to do.  So you start off here, you let everybody get used to the characters, and then you start  to build on it, and like you said, expand.  That's great.  Yeah.  Well, good luck, man.  Thanks.  It's very funny.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming in, man.  Yeah, it's been a pleasure.  Fun.  All right.  You guys are awesome.  Thanks, man.  Elijah Wood.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.

Don't you remember? 
[02:19:30]  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Command unit, please respond.

[02:20:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Elijah Wood.  Holy crap.  That was cool.  It was very cool, man.  A little starstruck, you think?  Him, I mean, when he saw us from the first time.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You could see it in his eyes.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys, especially since him being in The Lord of the Rings, and I fucking, 
[02:21:00]  it's right up there as one of my top movies, series, whatever you want to call it.  It's a masterpiece.  It is.  Epic.  I told Anthony during the break, no matter what he does for the rest of his career, he'll  always be associated with that film.  With a classic.  Those films, I should say.  But, yeah, at one point he's talking, and I'm just kind of looking at him.  I'm going like, hey, look, that's Elijah Wood.  That's Elijah.  Holy shit.  Hey, look, his mouth is moving like Elijah Wood's mouth moves into movies. 
[02:21:30]  So nice and so down to earth, though.  Right?  Down to middle earth.  I get it because it's a...  I try to be down to earth, though, man.  There's no reason not to be.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Oh, you didn't mean to.  Oh, Jimmy.  We always talk about ourselves.  He was very cool.  Joe DeRosa.  What's up, Joey?  DeRosa.  How are you, brother?  You motherfucker.  He's pulling a comment.  Fuck him. 
[02:22:00]  I'm kidding, by the way.  Joe.  What's up, Joe?  What's happening, man?  Look at you.  It's smiling Joe DeRosa.  Hi, Jim.  That's what we call him.  What brings you to this neck of the woods?  What are you doing in this part of the building?  I have to do two other shows over here.  You should have just done the Bob Kelly.  Did you hear what he did the other day?  What did he do?  That was classic.  He walked by this window like, yeah, I'm here and I'm not here for you guys.  He walked past, he tipped his sunglasses down and gave this half-assed peace sign thing 
[02:22:30]  as he was scurrying down the hall to be somewhere much more important.  And we did a little research.  Turns out he didn't have to walk down that long hallway.  He wanted to, to kind of show us, look, there's other people around here that want to talk to you, too.  There's a real buzz about me around here.  Right.  No one's talking about Bob.  Patrice is here and he's like, that fucking Bob Kelly just blew us off like that walking past,  like he got somewhere to be.  Fuck Bob Kelly. 
[02:23:00]  That's all Bobby's ever wanted out of life was to be able to snub somebody.  To snub, yes.  To just walk by and just go like that.  So he leapt at that opportunity.  To make him feel better about himself, but he never will.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If he could snub somebody as he's entering the pizzeria to balance out the guilt of what he's about to do.  That's so funny.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Now I got to do broad-minded.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:23:30]  Why?  La-da-da.  Ya-da-da.  No comment.  I don't know.  I got booked on it.  I don't know what it is.  What?  Don Wicklund's show.  What are you going to?  Oh, is that Don's show?  Why?  Don Wicklund's show.  What?  Why are they out of fucking D.C. with it here?  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  You have to do an ISDN.  They're not even going to be in the same room as you.  You're kidding me.  Usually.  Are you guys going to discuss recipes?  What are you going to do with them?  Recipes.  I thought it was a comedy show on Raw Dog.  Uh-oh.  Wait, is it?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Maybe it is.  I think it's on Cosmo. 
[02:24:00]  No?  Oh, wait.  No, I think it is.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Now you're fucked.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What is broad-minded?  Hold on.  I don't know.  Oh, well.  Fuck it.  What are you going to do?  You know what happened to me?  Sounds like your career is doing well.  Oh, Jesus.  He did a good job guest hosting for Andy Levy while Andy hosted for Greg.  You guest hosted?  No, guest hosted.  Guest Andy Levy.  Andy Levy was hosting.  He did Andy's part when Andy was doing Greg Gutfeld's part. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  You were getting raves on that.  It was fun.  Thanks, Jim, for saying that.  You were great, too.  Thank you.  Yeah, it was fun, man.  Yeah, they had me on a few times to do that.  It was fun, man.  I also want to apologize for the talent drop that has just happened in the room with Elijah  Wood walking out.  Oh, did you see that?  And then DeRosa walks in.  You're the buffer between him and Brooke Shields.  Yeah.  We need a regular.  We need one of our, you know.  Yeah, we need a little buffer.  We need a figure.  Something like that Sherbert.  Between two A-listers.  That's Sherbert that cleanses the palate.  That's you. 
[02:25:00]  Right.  You're the Sherbert.  Between the filet mignon and...  You brought in a W-lister between the two A-listers.  Yeah, we have Brooke Shields coming in today, man.  That's awesome.  What's she up to?  She's doing the Addams Family.  She's taking over the role of Morticia.  Oh, on Broadway.  I never thought that play would last.  I mean, obviously it's good if it's sitting around the floor.  This is the show you're doing.  Broadminding.  Start your day with the broads.  The broads.  Christine and Molly as they deliver their unfiltered opinions on news, entertainment, music, 
[02:25:30]  money, life, and finding a husband.  Look out.  The girls are probably pretty feisty.  Whether it's Molly asking Oscar winner Quentin Tarantino about his latest film or Christine  singing along with Kenny Rogers, it's unpredictable raw fun.  It's not raw fun.  One Star is a Friendship over 20 years ago is now a high-energy morning show that invites  you into the uninhibited lives of two women that have real problems, stories, thoughts,  and advice.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:26:00]  Yuck.  Well, I mean, that's great.  No, that's great, man.  Fire your man.  Yeah, come on.  Hey, I'm a good, healthy-minded male for them to talk to.  Who knows?  They might have a big audience, though.  Honestly, I think they're cool.  I don't know.  I hear they're all right.  We met them years ago, and actually, I knew it was nice.  I mean, they were fun.  Yeah, they were cool.  They were all right.  I just saw...  What's wrong with you?  I just said they were all right.  No, it's just...  You make me laugh.  You make me laugh, kid.  You make me laugh.  They were all...  I just saw Joe at the Louie thing. 
[02:26:30]  I did.  When we were walking out, did you see Natasha Lyonne from the American Pie movies walking  in?  She was at one of Burr's shows.  I met her a few weeks ago at Caroline's at one of Burr's shows.  Really?  She was at one of Burr's shows?  What is she, like a big stand-up comic fucking groupie?  I think she's like friends with Burr's manager, because she was there that night with him,  and then she showed up at the Louie thing, so I guess they're friends.  Nothing says listening, by the way, as packing your bag, as Joe's trying to answer your question.  I can multitask. 
[02:27:00]  I can pack my shit.  He asked Joe a question, and he's packing for like a trip.  Yeah, really?  It's like talking to a grip at the end of the shoot.  Really?  I only bring it up because his aunt does have to leave early.  It's not that he's not interested in your answer here.  Is that true?  Look at it.  He's bending over.  Who does she know?  Look at him.  He's just wrapping up wires.  I know.  Maybe you should explain to Joe that you have somewhere to go. 
[02:27:30]  Where are you going?  Actually, I got my yearly checkup.  Your what?  My yearly doctor checkup.  Yeah?  Yeah, I can only get a 10 o'clock fucking appointment.  Ah, Jesus Christ.  So I got to drive back out to Long Island now and get prodded, poked, and fucking everything  else by a doctor.  And then you got to go to the doctor.  I might get the fingers in the ass.  Stay tuned, people.  Stay tuned.  Have you ever got the fingers in the ass?  I've gotten a finger up the ass to check the prostate, and then he wipes it on something  to make sure there's no blood leaking out your asshole. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, your mustache.  I hope he doesn't have a cum detector on the thing.  Jesus.  Oh, Jimmy.  How do you feel about a finger up the ass non-clinically?  Non-clinically?  No.  Clinically?  No.  I don't like it at all.  No, I know it goes...  It's not made for that.  No, I know what goes on back there.  Really?  I'm a big fan.  You're a big fan?  Big, big fan.  My ass is like...  It doesn't work right with shit going in.  Shit coming out is fine. 
[02:28:30]  How come taking a nice dump feels great, but if you try to shove that dump back in, I'd  be screaming.  Yeah, no, I'm a...  You're a big fan, huh, Joe?  Jim, yeah?  I like my ass played with.  I can't be penetrated too much, but I like it even.  Yeah, because it feels like Jimmy then has to take shit.  Joe, how far?  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  First knuckle?  That means you like two knuckles.  All right, that's...  I'd be saying a lot.  No, we're grading on a curve.  If you're going to admit to one, that means you like two.  By the way, he's pointing to his wrist.  That's not a knuckle.  It's tough to hear.  It's a big-ass knuckle. 
[02:29:00]  It's a shoulder.  I'll just keep going further.  Just keep going.  Yeah, the first knuckle.  He's pointing to his right finger.  Yeah, that's why I brought it up.  I got to...  Can I tell you, it's really super fast, super fast.  I'm on Facebook the other day.  This girl, friend requests me, and she's really hot in the fucking picture, right?  Uh-oh.  And I'm looking, and I'm like, oh, this girl's cute, man.  So I go in, and I start looking at all her pictures.  I'm like, god damn, this girl is fucking beautiful.  Jesus Christ.  Really?  She wants to be...  I think she's like a model.  And I'm going through all the pictures, and I'm like, yeah, let me see. 
[02:29:30]  Let me see if she's taken.  And I go to the thing, and it's his interrelationship with Anthony Coombe.  Oh, shit.  You met her the other night.  I didn't recognize her, because all her Facebook pictures are like model pic, you know what  I mean?  They're all black and white, you know?  A little artsy.  And I was thinking, she does look kind of familiar.  It just wasn't registering.  That's hilarious.  Let me see what douche she's...  Oh, he's a good guy.  Oh, that douche.  Well, it is true.  That's magic.  I work that Jedi mind shit on girls.  You want to go out with me. 
[02:30:00]  I literally out loud at my computer, I went, oh, it figures.  Uh, yeah.  Well, let me go get a big man's finger up my ass.  Your backpack is fucking huge.  Yeah, I got computer equipment in there.  Yeah, that's a lot of shit.  There's a couple of cameras in there.  You got school books in there?  No, I think there's some of the shit that Roland gives me that I never take out of my bag.  Is it your go-to bag?  No, this is not my...  Well, it's kind of a go-bag.  It's got stuff to start fire in it if I get on matches. 
[02:30:30]  It's got a satellite phone.  I got a satellite phone in there.  I'm not even kidding.  You got your water purification tablets.  I got water purification tablets.  Survival things in there.  Yeah, just in case.  You never know.  You never know, Joe.  You know?  You guys are all going to be chasing me.  Anthony, what's in your backpack?  Help me, help me.  And I'll just be blasting away, going, shut up.  Get away from me.  I live.  You don't.  You're the first...  If there's ever a zombie outbreak or like walking dead, I'm coming to your house. 
[02:31:00]  I'd be the guy, though, that...  You'll be well protected.  I'd be the guy that like has all the equipment, is all prepared.  I'd be the first one to get bit in the neck by one of those bastards.  Yeah, trying to lead everybody in a battle.  Yeah, here we go.  I'm like, oh, that guy.  I got to get out of here.  All right, go, bro.  All right, go.  Here he goes then.  See you, man.  Good luck.  See you tomorrow.  All right, Joe.  It was good talking to you.  Oh, it hurts.  Jesus. 
[02:31:30]  What's going on, man?  What's going on?  Nothing.  Just fucking...  Just doing this, yeah.  What's, you know, how's the kid?  How's the family?  Good.  Good.  Very good.  Yeah?  That's good.  That's good.  I'm still single.  I had a nice Father's Day, yeah?  Yeah?  It's a big day with the kid, man.  I do have to tell you that...  I think I told you personally, but I don't know if I sit on the air yet. 
[02:32:00]  That movie that you guys did, that 15-minute movie, fuck, man.  It turned out well, huh?  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Seriously, I appreciate that.  Where you at with that?  It's playing at the...  I think it just screened in Chicago at Just for Laughs.  I couldn't go to that one.  And then it's going to Montreal Just for Laughs in July.  Last week in July.  And then Billy and Bobby and me are doing a live show to sort of cross-promote it up there or whatever. 
[02:32:30]  So that's what's happening right now.  But how do you make money off something like that?  You don't.  I mean, not a...  Because it's a short.  It's tough to...  Yeah, you don't, man.  There's just no...  There's no way to make any cash off of it.  But it gets your name out there and maybe the right people see it and it can lead to something else.  Is that how that works?  Yeah, I mean, I guess that's, you know, that's a possibility, you know, and it hopefully opens some doors up and stuff like that.  But, you know, at the end of the day, I think the most you could do with a short is maybe get it onto a DVD with other shorts or put it on a DVD of something full length. 
[02:33:00]  And, you know, as a bonus fee, it's like, what are you going to do?  Sell a DVD to your fans for $20?  Could it lead to a longer version?  Yeah, that's kind of what we're hoping to do.  We wrote a screenplay based on the short, so we're hoping that maybe we can sell that.  But, you know, it just hasn't...  It's just going through this process of, like, showing it to people and waiting for somebody that can actually maybe facilitate something like that happening.  You know what I mean? 
[02:33:30]  So, I don't know.  Maybe we'll go out and look for investors or something.  And I saw you guys, too, at the Louis premiere, and Bobby's all excited about the book.  Yeah, the book's...  Yeah, the book.  That came out of this, so that's exciting, man.  A book on cheating.  Oh, you don't want to give it away?  No, no, no.  Well, you said it's based on the movie, which is called Cheat.  What am I saying?  Well, yeah, no.  But they don't know...  You said it's based on the movie.  Your movie's called Cheat. 
[02:34:00]  What's wrong with you?  What am I giving away?  Well, we don't know what kind of cheating it is in the movie, so, you know?  It's, uh...  Your movie's called Cheat!  Yeah, I know, but it's not...  What did I do, really?  Nothing.  You said it's a book on cheating, but no one knows what kind of cheating you meant when  you just said that.  That's right.  That's right.  It may or may not be relationship cheating.  It may be cheating at cards.  It may be cheating on taxes.  You didn't just say what it was.  You just said a book on cheating. 
[02:34:30]  There you go.  So, I still haven't given anything away.  There you go.  All right.  It's good.  We're good.  I get all nervous, though.  I panic, because it's, like, so hard to talk about this without saying the wrong thing.  You know what I mean?  The movie?  Either.  Because the movie, it's like, there's, like, we're trying not to...  It's called Cheat, but we don't want to give away what it is.  Like Jimmy just was saying, you know?  What kind of...  And I certainly didn't either.  I don't know if we're even allowed to talk about it.  I don't know.  Okay, I got you.  You know what I mean?  You didn't do anything wrong.  No, I was just trying to pump you up and help you out a little bit.  No, it was... 
[02:35:00]  Thank you.  Because it's exciting that a book came out of the movie.  Yeah, no.  The book came out of the movie, so that'll be out in, I think, hopefully February.  Based on the movie.  Whatever the movie's about.  Yes.  Whatever it is.  Jesus.  All right.  I tried.  That should go home.  I tried.  I tried.  Am I blowing it today?  I'm just blowing it.  I'm sorry.  No, I love fucking with you.  I feel bad that you were trying to do something nice, and I panicked.  That's all right.  Which I do a lot.  No, I kind of get it, though, now.  I sort of get it.  Yeah.  But either way, that came out of me. 
[02:35:30]  You were in a tough spot.  Yeah, it's a tough spot.  What would you have asked Elijah Wood?  What would I have asked Elijah Wood?  Why?  I don't fucking know, man.  It's like I wanted to...  I was thinking about that when I was sitting out there listening.  What would I even talk to this guy about?  Because it's like all you want to do is talk about Lord of the Rings.  And I'm like, how fucking sick is this guy?  Did you talk to him about that?  Is that like an off-limits thing at this point?  Like enough?  We were discussing after the interview.  I think he appreciated that. 
[02:36:00]  You know, we spend a little time on it.  You got to.  But not a lot.  Right.  You know, he was cool down to earth.  He seems like a cool guy.  Yeah, and edgy, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, very nice dude.  I liked him a lot.  No, I mean edgy, though.  More edgy than I thought he would be.  Yeah, I mean, he's an adult male.  He wasn't like a typical Hollywood pussy like a lot of them are.  He was great.  Yeah.  Really cool guy.  And the new show looks all right, so.  Yeah, I got some.  I actually got some really good last watch on it, man.  I enjoyed it.  Well, based, I heard Jim's like testimonial of it.  It made me really want to see it.  Not that I didn't want to see it before, but when I heard that, I was like, oh, it sounds 
[02:36:30]  like not what I thought it was going to be very like indie art house.  You smoke pot?  A little bit.  Why?  I'm thinking about.  You thinking about smoking?  What?  You thinking about me smoking pot?  Yeah, I just want to make it very awkward for you right there.  No, my point, I think, and I want to ask Elijah, this Wilford seems like a show that if you  were a stoner, what do you think, Jimmy?  Yeah, I would love it. 
[02:37:00]  If you were stoned?  Yeah, because there's a lot of pot going in it.  Yeah, if you were stoned and then watch Wilford, I think it might be even more trippy for the  viewer.  Any comedy with pot, I'm sure it helps.  What's up with the knuckle thing?  You go too deep, huh?  Too knuckle deep?  Too knuckle deep.  No, I go one knuckle deep.  Two fingers, one knuckle?  I'm not adverse to the idea of two knuckles.  It just doesn't fit.  I just don't want it to hurt.  It's not like a gay thing where I'm like, no, I'm fucking take two knuckles.  I would do it.  The listeners, they changed how me and Ann thought about that. 
[02:37:30]  I always thought it was kind of a gay thing.  No, no, no.  And then the fingers and also strap-ons.  We got into the strap-on discussion and me and Ann were like, that's fucking gay.  The strap-ons are...  And the listeners convinced us otherwise, so good for them.  They turned us on that one.  I think the strap-ons are...  Would you take a strap-on?  No, that's a dick.  That's gay at that point.  But the listeners say it's not.  It's not.  I think I...  They came out of the woodwork saying it's not. 
[02:38:00]  I think you just want me to somehow admit that I would take a strap.  I tried taking it, but I couldn't.  I often tried fucking it.  I can't.  Yeah, I don't...  What if it was shaped differently?  Huh?  What if it was shaped differently, so it didn't look like a dick?  Right.  No.  Which is tough to do, because you're going to think dick every time.  That's where my...  Yeah, I mean...  What if it looked like a banana?  It was yellow.  Yeah.  It looked like a banana.  Yeah, what if it totally didn't look like a cock?  Without that stem, because I think the stem would really fuck you up.  Right, right, yeah.  Now would you take it?  Would you take a banana up your ass? 
[02:38:30]  No.  That was strapped on to a woman?  No, because it's...  You know what it is?  There's a mental thing here.  It's not the idea...  It's not just, oh, I want something in my ass, because it feels good.  It feels good.  There's something about it being part of the woman, and the woman doing that.  Once she puts the strap on on, then it's not part of her anymore.  Does this make sense?  You know what I mean?  When she's putting her finger in, it's like, that's her.  That's part of her.  And she's doing that because she wants to do that. 
[02:39:00]  Once she puts a strap on, then it becomes this thing of sort of like a fantasy, where  it's like, oh, pretend I have a cock, and I'm fucking you.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I don't think I can get past the silliness of it.  Yeah.  Now she's strapping on the belt.  Once she's stepping into it.  I don't know.  I don't know if I can get past that part of it.  Yeah, there is something silly about it.  It is, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay.  Yeah, I don't know.  Would you blow a strap on, Jim?  Wow.  What do I have?  Where's that come from, Joe?  That's a little weird.  I don't know.  We're talking about strap-ons. 
[02:39:30]  I've done it, yeah.  Yeah?  Sure.  How do you feel?  I'm assuming you're completely against it, Opie.  I don't understand the point of that.  I don't know.  People get into it.  There's something dirty and humiliating about it, if a girl is telling you to do it.  There's something humiliating about it.  Would you, Joe?  No.  Liar.  No.  I don't think I would.  I don't think I would.  You kind of want to, though.  I mean, but you'll take a chick's finger in your mouth, right?  What's wrong with that?  No, I'm saying, that's why I'm saying I don't think I would, because I'll do that, and I'm 
[02:40:00]  like, well, is there a difference?  I don't know.  Once again, it's attaching something.  It's a toy.  I've never been a big toy guy.  Yeah, I know.  Like, it just doesn't.  I think it goes back to just being silly.  All of a sudden, you're, like, sucking on a strap-on.  What if it wasn't attached to her?  What if you just hold it like this?  Would you?  Yeah.  Yeah?  There's still a girl's ass you're reaching under and squeezing.  It's still a fucking, there's a pussy under it.  And you'd be surprised how they like the feel of it against the top of their pussy. 
[02:40:30]  It's just a dirty thing to do.  Sure.  Dude, do you put it in the dishwasher after you're done?  Yeah, how do you clean one of those?  With the cereal bowls?  I've cleaned a girl's dildo before, and you've just got to wash it in the sink.  That's the most humiliating part.  When you look up and make eye contact with yourself in the mirror.  As you're scrubbing yourself?  Yeah, and you're washing the star of the show.  Scrubbing it before you give it back to her?  Yeah.  Because my average dick just couldn't do the job?  I don't know.  I met a couple of twin porn stars recently. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, at a club.  What do you mean a couple?  More than a pair?  They're twins.  No, I get the twins, but it sounded like you've met more than one pair of porn twins.  No, I just mean a set of twins.  One set of twins.  Gotcha.  At a club recently.  And one of my favorite porn videos of all times is they put on...  One puts on a strap on and fucks the other one.  And it's filthy because not only is one sister getting fucked by her sister, 
[02:41:30]  the other one is going, oh yeah, you just feel so good on my pussy.  They're getting into fucking each other as legally as they're allowed to on video  and then distributed or whatever.  How was their acting?  Were you buying into the fact that she was really enjoying it?  I 100% bought it.  And were they real sisters in real life?  They're twins.  They're identical twins.  Oh, that's fucking weird.  I 100% bought it.  So I'm at a club and I see these two girls and I turn to my friend and I go,  I think they're porn stars.  And he goes, no, no, no, I don't think so.  And I sat down and there was a bunch of us there and slowly but surely people 
[02:42:00]  started walking away.  And then finally it was just me and the two of them.  And I was like, hey, sorry, that was rude of me.  I'm Joe.  And I introduced myself.  And they gave me their names.  And I said, are you guys on, do you work in the business?  Because I didn't know how to breach the subject.  And she goes, they go, no, no, no, no, why?  And I go, you just look familiar.  Do I know you? 
[02:42:30]  No, no.  And I go, are you sure?  You don't work in the industry in any way?  And they go, yeah.  And I go, in any capacity.  And one of them goes, what's that supposed to mean?  And I go, nothing.  It's just you look familiar.  And they go, no, sorry, not us.  And literally it was like everybody just sat there like this with their head down for like  two minutes.  And then the one finally goes, well, years ago we did some movies together.  And I go, you're the porn twin.  You're porn.  And they go, yeah, yeah.  And they go, but we don't even recognize that part of our lives anymore. 
[02:43:00]  We don't acknowledge it.  And I was like, all right, well, that's cool.  I respect that.  You did something.  You're not down.  But as I was talking with them and being like, wow, these are totally, what, normal people?  It's like, you're like, no, I saw you fuck your sister with a struggle.  Yeah, they just didn't want to acknowledge it.  It kept popping back in.  Right.  It kept popping back in.  Wow.  Yeah, so.  Well, Joe, thanks for stopping in.  No, they're telling us.  They're telling us.  They're saying it's good.  And I'm not doing the gag.  You're scheduled for 9-15 with Broadminded. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  So now they can tune over to Broadminded to check out the interview over there?  Or stay here and listen to our Brooke Shields interview.  I shouldn't send listeners.  I don't care.  They'll hear the Brooke Shields either way.  Oh, yeah, on the replay.  That's true.  Guys, I'm going to miss you, to be honest with you.  Why?  Are you becoming a star?  No.  Right now, I'm going to miss you.  No.  When I leave, I'm.  What is it today?  You're just saying weird shit.  I'm not.  I'm saying like I don't want to.  You're not going to miss us? 
[02:44:00]  I have fun.  Well, we'll have you come back for a longer session.  Yeah.  At least you stopped in and said hi, unlike your pal Bob Kelly.  Well, you know.  Here, there was a stromboli at the end of the hallway.  Whoa.  You guys are podcasting together?  He does a podcast called You Know What, Dude.  I'm on it a lot, but I'm not like a permanent fiction.  He's trying to pull you away from Bill Burr, isn't he?  There's something going on there.  There's something going on.  There's a little tug of war between Bill Burr and Bob Kelly.  The three of us are doing shit together.  Now everybody's breaking it off.  But then Bobby's like kind of pulling you his way a little bit. 
[02:44:30]  Bill's like, eh, what are you doing?  It's like the band when the singer goes and does his own album and the rest of the band  does their own album.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  We're the rest of the band right now.  If you had to choose, which one would you choose?  If I could shake both of them fucking loose, I would.  Oh, really?  No, I'm kidding.  Do your own thing?  No, I'm kidding.  You can only pick Bill Burr or Bob Kelly.  It depends on what the situation is.  It depends on what the situation is.  You know the question.  If it's talking about two guys that can be emotional with each other once in a while, I'm going with Kelly. 
[02:45:00]  Absolutely.  You enjoy that you can get emotional with Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  And Bill Burr will be like, what?  If it comes with somebody trying to keep me stable, I'm going with Burr every day of the fucking week.  You're a politician.  I am.  You have to pick one.  I can't.  How about one for a podcast?  Can I?  For a podcast?  Right.  You're in the podcast world.  This is your thing.  You can either go with Bill Burr or Bob Kelly based on what you know.  That's a tough one.  Bobby's a lot of fun to talk to, but Billy's got quite a listenership to his podcast. 
[02:45:30]  So you would go with Bob Kelly.  You know, if I was keeping it real and artsy, I'd go with Bob.  I love that.  We just broke up a friend.  If I was going to the major labels, I'd go with Burr.  Depends if you want to go independent or mainstream.  Yeah.  You know, sometimes I want to go indie.  Sometimes I want to be the indie rock band.  I see what you're saying.  And sometimes I want to be an Aerosmith.  You know what I mean?  No.  I'm just kidding, Bob.  It's just a joke in case you're listening.  All right, Joe. 
[02:46:00]  They want you over there.  I'll see you guys.  Thanks for letting me pop in.  Right on.  Good seeing you.  What are we promoting?  Anything quick?  I'll be at Stand Up New York tonight for a show called Love Machine.  It's a late show at Stand Up New York tonight.  Come out.  It's a new show.  It's supposed to be pretty cool.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks, Joe.  Later.  Thank you, man.  Do we have time to break before Brooke Shields or no?  No.  We have like a minute, I think, before she's in.  Yeah.  She's just finishing out.  And then we have her for like 15, 20 minutes.  That's it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're better off staying.  Last time I tried to go on at Stand Up New York, they wouldn't put me on.  So I'll never go back. 
[02:46:30]  Why?  Oh, that was the place?  It was one of them.  Why wouldn't they do that?  Who knows?  I'll never walk in there again.  And the fucking Chicago Comedy Festival, I was so irritated.  We did the Wednesday night show, which is a weird night for a show.  We were guaranteed that we would be the only show that night.  That's why you do a Wednesday show.  It's hard to sell tickets on a Wednesday.  It's fucking Wednesday, middle of the week.  So they come to you and go, look, don't worry about it.  You're the only show, so that'll help the numbers.  Wow.  She looks good.  Yeah, she does. 
[02:47:00]  So we agreed to it, and then they put another show on sale with Ron White.  She's in the restroom?  Can we take a tiny, tiny break?  How long is a one break?  A single.  Four minutes?  That's good.  I mean, it'll eat into your time.  Huh?  It'll eat into your time.  Oh, she's in the bathroom.  Take a one break.  Take a single, and we'll come right back.  All right.  Brooke Shields next.  Well, actually, Opie and Jim Norton. 
[02:47:30]  Anthony had to head out early today.  Yes.  Brooke Shields.  How are you, Brooke?  Hi, Brooke.  How are you?  You look great.  Thank you.  I think she's becoming our friend.  Yes.  You're our friend now.  Yeah.  I'm a friend.  Yes.  If you've done the show twice, you become a friend.  And if you drink red wine.  You remember that?  Crack it on.  Remember that?  Oh, I remember.  I was trying to be cool.  That's when I knew you were cool, because it was homemade wine from Vinny's uncle. 
[02:48:00]  His uncle, Gino.  His uncle, Gino's.  From Jersey Shore.  Right.  We have not seen them since.  No.  And Brooke just-  And it was like in the basement.  They made it in the basement.  Yeah.  It's not good stuff.  How bad was it?  Now they're not here.  It was ripe.  It was ripe.  Very ripe.  Did you drink it to be polite, or because it was getting you where you needed to go fast?  That's right.  So it's all about that.  Yeah.  It's just getting a good bump.  Yeah.  Homemade wine does that.  Really?  It gets you loaded quick.  Well, it was very syrupy, but I remember thinking, all right, this is it. 
[02:48:30]  You either have the you-know-whats or not, so.  So you were being polite, but she hated the wine, and she's just a very nice person.  We all hated the wine.  That's the point.  It was warm.  Yeah.  Very.  It was just, I don't know.  Very fermented.  But I felt I was honored to have been brought into the fold.  Yeah, by drinking.  But that really is awful.  We have an A-list celebrity come in, and we give her this idiot's wine.  Right.  This foul stuff he carried in his pocket.  But then I'm thinking, wow, Brooke's cool.  Because most would say, no, with the wine.  I'm not here to drink his shitty wine.  Are you doing TV today, too, or are you just doing radio? 
[02:49:00]  TV, I did.  I'm going to do The View.  Wow.  Why do so many people hate doing radio?  Because you could do any show you want to do, but a lot of people don't like doing the  general thing of radio.  Well, I wonder why.  I always, I like the format, actually.  I feel like there's a, you, there's a freedom to it.  Right.  I think there's a freedom to it.  And I actually respect it as a medium, because I think it's been, it's endured.  You know?  Right, right, right.  And I don't know.  I didn't know people didn't like it.  Some people don't.  I think a lot of.  Maybe it's just, is it just personal?  It probably is. 
[02:49:30]  It's probably, they just hate doing this particular show, because they have to sit  where you're sitting.  No, there's a lot of celebrities that blow off radio and go right to TV.  A lot.  A lot.  But it's such a, it's a different type of intimacy with people.  You know what I mean?  Like you're, I think people wake up, they wake up with it, they live with it, and I think  they get to have their own independent sort of relationship with it.  So that's why, I mean.  And you could take your time with it.  You know what I mean?  We haven't even started the interview yet, but she's on the air, hanging with us. 
[02:50:00]  It is, it is.  No, I'm serious, though.  It's not like, okay, go, go, go.  What are you working on?  And, you know.  Yeah, three minutes, and then a clip, and then you're done, and then a commercial.  Right, right, right.  It's less formatted in that way.  Or safe that way, which is much better.  The confines are different.  Right.  How's that?  People really do get a weird relationship with you on radio, because they're listening every  day, and it's a soap opera, and they know so much about you, because you've got  to fill four hours, so they learn everything.  But they also can create a visual that they choose. 
[02:50:30]  Do you know what I mean?  It's a, it's a, they get to have their own independent relationship with you.  Right.  Because you're not sitting, watching somebody, and then you know that that person is seeing  the same part.  Right.  You know, so they're, they, they can envision whatever they want, and it's, I think it's  more intimate in a weird way.  Do you attract, I mean, I think for a woman it's harder, because, especially, you know,  a beautiful woman, a model, do you attract kind of a weird, eclectic group of fans?  Like, I'm sure you have nice people that like you, and then the creepy ones, and you're  like, ugh, I have to shake your hand. 
[02:51:00]  Get out the Purell.  So, I, I have such a, I've been around for so long that they, that the scope of, and  the age range is sort of staggering.  Really?  So, it's the, you know, it's grandparents, and there's this little kid, like a little,  little Broadway kid just yesterday, and she was like, I know you, and I thought, you're  six.  How do you, how the hell do you know?  Like, and it's, you know, it wasn't Hannah Montana, or, you know what I mean?  It's a, there's definitely an, I have an eclectic, and also there's people that have  like, grown up with me, and they've got the, whatever it is, with Blue Lagoon, or 
[02:51:30]  whatever that world, and then there's a, so it's different.  But how did that kid know you?  She, um, saw the Tonys.  She watched the Tonys.  Oh, wow.  And she was, and I, I heard her talking to her mom, and it was one of those, like,  very stage mother, you know, you have that tap class tomorrow, and you have this,  and I just, I never lived in that, that era of, of, I mean, I didn't, I wasn't  this, on stage when I was a kid.  Right.  But it was definitely, like, the professional mom, and then, and the kid 
[02:52:00]  recognized, and I was really, it was kind of, I didn't know if I was sad about it,  or if I, it was like, I wanted her, she was too young to know about the Tonys.  And speaking of kids, I read recently, uh, you don't want your kids in showbiz,  right?  I, you know, I can't be a hypocrite.  Like, I, it's one of those things where I love what I do so much, but it's also a  business that is just, it's all about rejection, and it's all about not being  good enough, and it's all about someone getting there first, and, you know, you're  always, you're always not tall enough, not short enough, not blonde enough, not 
[02:52:30]  young enough, not old enough.  Like, it's, there's something about it, and I just, I would love them to not feel  that rejection.  Do you, do you get used to it after a while, though?  Like, are you comfortable, like, I mean, now you probably don't get a lot of it,  but.  I don't, I don't, I don't think you ever get used to it, and especially if you're an  entertainer at your heart, it's, you want approval all the time, you know, whether it's  you're a comedian, you want to be funny, or you, you, you want that, like, there's  this validation that no matter where you are, I don't think you ever feel like you 
[02:53:00]  get it.  And can I point out what a phony I am?  I just asked Brooke Shields, like, do you ever get used to rejection?  Like, I don't know the answer to that.  Of course you do.  I've adapted.  No, I don't know if you get used to it, though.  I think you just get, you start to go, oh, I get it.  I'm going to go over there, then.  Go where you're wanted.  Like, I mean, that's, my career has been, go where I'm wanted.  Right.  Because when, you know, when television's cold to me, you know, I get to, I'm lucky  enough to be able to go, okay, I'm going to go over here, or I'll write a book, or I'll, 
[02:53:30]  you know, I mean, there's been, I refuse to allow myself to feel rejected, but you feel  it.  I've gotten, I've gotten used to a certain level of it.  Like, where, like, I understand a lot of it comes, for me, not as much as stand up  with other vehicles.  But you're right, you can always go and do something else.  I didn't think of that.  But, yeah, you're used to it, though?  Oh, I just, I expect it.  But maybe that's what comics are like.  But, yeah, I just automatically expect it.  I'm used to it.  I don't know if anyone would get used to rejection.  You know how to handle it after a while. 
[02:54:00]  That's a rough feeling to go through.  I'm surprised when they don't.  That's where I'm at.  I'm surprised when they don't.  But is that a defense mechanism?  Oh, yeah, probably.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I think that that's like, because you don't really, I think what happens is  it used to be where if I was in a room full of people and there was one person that I  felt I hadn't won over, I didn't like me, I would focus on that person.  Right.  And that I've stopped doing.  And getting back to the kid thing, it's one thing to feel rejection yourself.  I'm finally a parent.  My kid's 13 months old.  Oh.  I can't imagine going through him being rejected. 
[02:54:30]  You'd want to kill.  Like, you, it's, it's, it's all of a sudden irrational to, like, that is, you know, and  I, my older one, she used to go and look on the playground and I'd see her walk up to  kids and be like, you want to play with me?  And they'd say no.  And she'd go, okay.  And she'd say, you want to play with me?  No.  And I would watch her, watch her just get rejected on the, and then she would just dance  around her, you know what I mean?  And you kind of went like, wow, that's resilience.  You know, I don't.  Because she's going, F you, my mom's Brooke Shields.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Sorry.  Yeah.  No, now they're starting to.  Do they understand how this whole thing works?  You know, it started a little bit at school because some of like the fourth graders and  the, or it's like second grade and then fourth graders gave my older one a hard time.  And, and they said something like, your mom's famous.  And she answered back with something and I didn't know what it was.  And then I asked the teacher and she, her answer was, she's not a good idea.  She's not just famous.  And I was like, that's so cool.  It's a good answer. 
[02:55:30]  Six year old.  You know what I mean?  I mean, it was just, so I'm not as worried.  I'm not as worried, but it definitely, they're now starting to like if mom, but now if you  have something that precedes you, like going into Broadway or going into the Addams family,  that now is bigger than my just being famous.  Right.  So they're able to focus on that.  They'll be like, my mom's going to go into the Addams family.  You should go.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So it's a thing that's, it's less about their mom and more about, I don't know, it separates  it a little bit.  Who are you replacing, by the way? 
[02:56:00]  Bebe North.  Let me see.  I'm not familiar with Broadway.  Oh, you know her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  If you saw her face.  Wasn't she also on Cheers?  She was on Cheers.  She was on Cheers.  She's on Cheers.  She's a real.  And Frasier.  Oh, okay.  I'm sure I would know her if I saw her.  Yeah, you would absolutely know her.  Consummate, like in Broadway, did Chicago for one of the, she's one of the only people  I think to play both Velma and Roxy.  And she's been at it.  You know, she's the.  Are you excited?  I am.  I'm, you know, I got, the dress is really hard to navigate and the wig is a bit, and 
[02:56:30]  you know, doing a show, I've been doing shows now for years, and not being 28 doing a show  and you're doing eight a week, it's, I can feel it now.  You're sort of like, wow, it's a, it's a tough one.  Oh, that's her?  Okay, yeah, I don't recognize her.  You pretty much got to get in shape to do Broadway, I would imagine.  It's like being, it's like being an athlete.  It's definitely.  Right.  You got to learn how to pace yourself and find some kind of rhythm.  And you have to live like an athlete, do you?  You know what?  I think I might have to see The Addams Family. 
[02:57:00]  I definitely want to see it.  I had never seen a musical, and then I saw Book of Mormon a couple of times.  We both went.  Oh, you did?  Did you?  I enjoyed it.  So I'm like, now I would see, see, when I first heard about The Addams Family, I didn't  want to see it, but now it's still around.  It's not like a quick run.  It's still here, so it must be good because it's been around.  You know what, it's like, it's an iconic, it's, it spans such a long period of time.  From the original television show, which was like in the 50s, and then you've got  the movies with Angelica Houston and Raul Julia, and that became sort of iconic in its 
[02:57:30]  own way.  And now this is a, it's when you, I have to say I understand what you mean because you  think, oh, it's for, you know, people are going to come and see it in the summer, but  it's a very, very beautifully crafted show.  And it's funny, and it's very, um, wry.  Is it hard walking into one, like, where the cast that's already established, too, where  like, you're the new person in the cast?  And you are, you're the new kid.  Like, you have to, you have to, um, there's a lot of respect, though, that, that, um, I  have for all of those, all the performers, and you realize more than in any other medium 
[02:58:00]  how much you need each other.  Who else is in that?  Um, uh, Roger Reese is, uh, replaced Nathan Lane, and so it's the two of us were, and  he, you'd recognize him, too, and he's a very, he's a thespian, and he's, he's just a lovely  energy, and, um, it's good.  It's a, it's, uh, you know, you asked, you get asked to play Mortician.  Have you done one?  You have to say yes, right?  You say yes.  Of course.  Have you done one yet?  I haven't, and I haven't even done it with the whole cast. 
[02:58:30]  Okay.  And we, um, I've been in rehearsals, and today is one of the first days I get to be  on stage with other actors.  When does, when are you actually, um, like, if people, you can get tickets, Adam's Family  Musical, it's two D's, adamsfamilymusical.com, when can you get, when will you actually be  on the stage?  My first show is Tuesday.  Oh, wow, it's coming out.  Right around the corner now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, my first show.  So, how long have you been rehearsing?  Uh, two weeks.  This is our third week.  Oh, okay.  Which is actually longer than I've ever been given for a show, because they're rewriting 
[02:59:00]  some of the book, and some of the, the choreography, they're changing it, and they're also preparing  the road, the tour, so they're rewriting some of the, the book, you know, the book is like  the script.  Okay.  So, it's like books, lyrics, and then choreography, and, uh, and they've added, they've, we've  sort of finessed it a little bit, and so it feels new.  It feels like it's going to be new.  So, when you, when you walk out onto the stage, you have to, like, pause, because people are  going to applaud when they first see you. 
[02:59:30]  Well, this entrance, um, for the actual Adams family, because we're at the unit with Pugsley  and Wednesday and Lurch, and, um, uh, it's a, it's such a showcase, like a house crashes  down, and, and it's one of the best orchestrations of an entrance, and so, basically, you're begging  for the applause.  There's no, there's no way around it.  Yes, so it doesn't come as humiliating.  Yes, exactly.  It kind of has to, it has to show up.  Do you know the, uh, you know.  That's all, yeah.  The two.  Imagine if she can't get that right. 
[03:00:00]  I'm like, God, she's really good, but she can't snap.  She just doesn't know how to snap correctly.  Yeah, she snaps out of tune, like a second after everybody else.  Just a little bit later.  Oops.  Did you, are you happy when you see, like, I can't say happy, but you see someone like  Spider-Man, which is so much, and it's been such a, a mess so far, and it's got to make  you feel better about the show you're doing.  Like, well, nobody wants to go see that, because it's a disaster waiting to happen, so at least  this one's working.  The weird thing is everyone does want to see it.  Oh, do you think it's a disaster?  Yeah, it's a, it's a weird thing going on with that.  It's like a car accident.  Yeah.  It's like big, but you know, I haven't seen it, um. 
[03:00:30]  They re-worked the whole thing, and they're trying again now, so.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if it'll ever make back its money, but it's almost, I mean, I can't  imagine.  80 million, I think, is, is what it's in the hole.  Someone, a promoter I talked to recently told me, they would have to be sold out until  sometime at the end of 2012 or 2013, every show.  Just to break even?  To break even.  Wow.  It's not good.  No, that's a shame, because you know a lot of hard work went into it.  Oh, God, yeah.  Um, but it's, you know, I, I went to go see the Addams Family, and went with my older daughter,  and the minute the orchestra starts, the audience snaps. 
[03:01:00]  Like, it's, it's part of Americana, it's like a part of people's psyche, and so you're  like, oh, you know what?  This is a, a hit.  Hey, I gotta go to Bobby in New York.  Uh, Bobby, we got Brooke Shields in studio.  She's gonna be doing Addams Family.  What's up, buddy?  I actually, uh, when I found out she was doing Addams Family, I'm a big fan of Addams Family,  I bought five tickets for me and my family to go front row, actually.  Oh, goodness.  Just, just because, just because of you on O.B. and Anthony, because your rapport with  them is really, really good. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  When Jimmy, when Jimmy started talking about Brooke Shields, and you guys met, doing, um,  Oh, Furry Vengeance.  Furry Vengeance.  And Jimmy's like, yeah, she wants to come in.  I'm like, no way does Brooke Shields want to come in and hang with us.  We had so much fun.  I guess I had a weird, maybe it's a reputation.  I just thought this would be above you or something.  I don't know.  I don't know what it was.  Beneath you, I'm just sorry.  I'm not beneath, excuse me, excuse me.  I'm sorry, yes, I'm sorry, sorry.  It's the subtle slip of a megalomaniac.  No, you're right.  It's so above you.  I'm like, ah, we're, she's not going to buy it.  Well, thank, thank you for buying the, uh, the tickets, Bob. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, Bob's going to be in the front row, so.  Bob's going to be in the front row, and there's a, there's an orchestra pit, which is, which  is always special.  A lot of shows I've done, um, we haven't had a pit.  The, the orchestra's been behind us, so it's always a, a treat for the.  The orchestra pit is, is, you can actually see the orchestra.  You can see the orchestra, yeah.  And they're all, they're all in the pit, and they're all, all playing, and it's being conducted  from, it's called the pit.  The, uh, how many weeks you got to do?  Um, I'm, well, through the summer, and, you know, I guess if they, if I do a good job,  or if I don't get booed off the stage, then. 
[03:02:30]  No, yeah.  Have you ever gotten bad reviews in theater?  Like, I mean, I, I know that it's, it's a, it's not like you took one moment in a theater.  They come to see you one night.  Yeah.  With a movie, you can redo it in takes, but with one night, they come to see you, and that's  your whole review.  And they never give you a chance, especially with me.  Like, they never give me a chance to sort of get into the run, or, and then sort of give  me the benefit of the doubt.  It's always, um, you know, I try, that's, that's the one area that I try really not to  get hurt by it, just because you have to go do it again that night, and you can't go in 
[03:03:00]  there with your tail between your legs.  Do you even pay attention to reviews at this point in your career?  I can't, because if you, you know, I, I read, I remember reading once that if you believe  the, the good, then you have to believe the bad, or if you believe the bad, then you have  to believe, like it's, and it's, it's definitely, I feel like people feel the need to critique  in a, uh, you know, and everybody's got an opinion.  And the only thing that I can do is do it eight shows a week, you know, when you do it 
[03:03:30]  eight times a week, and just that alone, I'm proud to survive.  Have you bumped into any critics who have given you like a bad, uh, or anybody who has, who  you know has bad mouthed you publicly?  And I imagine you run in some of the same circles.  I don't think they, they make it a point to talk to me.  I think, but I just, uh, you know, and again, it's like, because the, the thing that you  have to know is that each person that bought a, a ticket or five, like Bob, um, it could 
[03:04:00]  be first family where we have a lot of fat listeners.  It could just be Bob.  It's one of the listeners that will behave, but each one of those people, they've spent  a good amount of money on that ticket and Broadway in particular, especially in this day.  And you have to do that show for them, you know, and they, they've either, it's a destination,  it's a gift, it's a, it's an anniversary, it's a, it's a big deal to go to theater and  you have to do it for every single one of those, those people. 
[03:04:30]  And that's what gets you past bad reviews.  It really is fun though.  I can't believe how much I enjoyed a musical.  Like I definitely will go, I'm not being polite either.  I will absolutely go see this because I'm like, oh, that's why people like coming to a  Broadway show.  I never got it.  And then I saw a musical I liked.  I'm like, oh fuck, this is a lot of fun, man.  I would definitely do this again.  I mean, musicals are their own sort of breed.  I mean, I, I've been getting to see a lot of straight plays too.  And you know, the, the commitment that I just saw Jerusalem, uh, the night before last  and I was mesmerized, you know, I was absolutely in awe. 
[03:05:00]  Is it a drama or a musical?  It's a drama and it's a, there's two intermissions and it's, um, but I was in such awe, you know,  I was, I was the only one in the theater in my mind.  It was all done for me.  How long is it?  Um, it's yeah, two and a half, almost three hours.  That's not bad.  Yeah.  And it's, but it, you don't know it.  It goes, it goes by very quickly.  But I think just that there, there are a few things in the industry that are still about  just hard work and you don't, and talent, but you don't get rewarded for bad behavior 
[03:05:30]  in theater.  You know, it's not, it's not celebrated.  It's everybody's in there.  You sign a call board.  You're one of a cast of however many, and you have to work your ass off.  Like you just, and that's, I don't, I think that that's why I have such respect.  Leave the ego at the door.  Well, do you know what?  On a movie though, like, like, I think they'll tolerate a lot of shit on a movie that they  wouldn't tolerate on a live stage because you wreck the entire performance for everybody  if you're not prepared on a stage. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  And if you're, you know, you don't get to show up late, you know, you don't get to not  come out of your dressing room or you don't get to, you know, you do your own makeup.  You do your, you know, I mean, I have a wig, so I don't, I don't do my own hair,  but I get, someone does that.  You do your own.  It's a, it's like being, we're like gypsies, you know, you're like, you're in a troop.  It's kind of like going back to it, to earlier days where before, you know, you were very  famous and taking, it's like bare bones.  Everybody kind of does their own shit.  There's a bunch of you go.  And if you don't show up, you know, there's someone else who's ready and waiting and 
[03:06:30]  prepared.  Hey, do you, do you even have a memory of not being famous?  Cause you pretty much hit when you were 12, I guess.  Right.  Somewhere around there.  I, I don't.  Do you even have a memory of walking around like just being anonymous?  Anonymous?  No.  And I think that that's, um, in a way it was a helpful thing because I've seen young people  who aren't, don't have any fame.  And then in one movie or one year, they become absolutely more famous than they could handle  and they don't know how to handle it. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  You know, I never, I never knew what it was like to not be recognized.  Right.  So in a way it was never a big deal.  Right.  Okay.  You know, and you, and there's a certain level of access that the media has always had to  my life.  And as sick as that is, you sort of go, oh, you know, okay.  It's, I don't feel so violated because it's been, it's, I know now how to navigate my privacy  and keep it without it being threatened. 
[03:07:30]  I saw you once.  Uh, I had a whole, it's not bad.  I had a holy shit moment because we're lucky enough to talk to a lot of celebrities, but  you're one, you know, you're, you're in the, you know, you're a list or whatever.  I'm having a juice in the neighborhood at a vegetable juice place that I like going to  and I'm just hanging out at the counter looking out on the sidewalk.  And all of a sudden I look up and there's your face through the window.  I'm like, holy shit, that's Brooke Shields.  Was it Liquitaria?  Uh, no.  No.  Juice Generations.  Oh, Juice Generations. 
[03:08:00]  So I see.  Yeah.  So had she been on yet or no?  No.  No.  Oh, no.  And I, and it took me back like, holy crap.  And you were, I know what, I think you were going to a little, uh, yoga place or something.  I've tried.  Did I have a mat or a mat?  You looked like you were dressed for yoga.  Let's just put it that way.  And I just had that moment with myself like, holy shit, that's Brooke Shields.  I don't know what this means.  No, but it's, I never know.  I approach people if they're not with their children or whatever.  I'll always walk up and go, hi.  And I just try to take a picture. 
[03:08:30]  It's creepy.  No, I mean, you know.  You're the fat guy?  I am.  Well, I got her at the cellar, uh, years ago.  You had stopped in to see Colin and I got her popping out of the cellar.  I just happened to stand by the door and, uh, she was very nice to everybody.  Tim likes his pictures.  Uh, you're a fan of, uh, comedy, obviously.  I'm a fan of comedy.  Stand up.  I, I, yeah.  You know, it's, and my husband is, um, he, he was, uh, he was like one of those guys  that would just sell the jokes, you know, and he, he went to business school just so  that he could get to New York and then he, he was born here, but then he went, he was 
[03:09:00]  raised all over.  And, you know, I just, all those guys, like just-  Wait, he would sell the jokes when he was a writer?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's like, he sold like Jim Carrey a joke for like 50 bucks or something like that.  You know what I mean?  It's like you hear those stories and you're like, I used to go see Adam Sandler all the  time and, and Chris, you know, like those guys, I just would, we'd go in on a Wednesday  night or we'd go to Caroline's or we'd go to whatever with my friends and-  What is this, because you, you, you're on the other end that we're on, like all the  Tracy has gotten in trouble and, you know, people say stupid things and when you're in 
[03:09:30]  this world of everything you say is scrutinized and then any special interest group comes to  you and goes, look, this bothers us.  We want you to do this, this, and this.  Is the motivation normally because you're afraid of, you think people are afraid that  everything's going to be taken away if they don't do it exactly as whatever special interest  group it is asks them to do it?  Like, you know what I mean?  You know what I'm talking about?  Kind of.  But what's the-  Like, what, what is the counterbalance to that?  Like, how, how do you counter that?  Whatever the instance is, it doesn't even have to be his instance. 
[03:10:00]  When, when somebody, when they're pressuring you, they said, well, you've done something  that bothers us and you might not feel like you have.  What is the counterbalance to that?  You know, I think that you, there's, you've got to be like a, you have to be so diplomatic  because you don't want to sell out entirely.  Right.  You don't want to go against what you really feel.  And yet you have to sort of say, take into account that you now, as a public figure, there  is a certain responsibility, not to play by the rules, but to, um, to at least be, be responsible 
[03:10:30]  for what you, you say.  Do you know what I mean?  You can't just say, well, this is the way I feel because unfortunately you're, you're  given a lot of opportunity by being in that position.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, I think I'm sort of talking in circles, but-  No, not really.  No, I totally got it.  You, it's a delicate, delicate place to be and it's very-  You kind of got to be a politician.  As I was going to say, it's very political.  And you, you know, I understand people saying, well, this is it. 
[03:11:00]  But it's, you're also, you're in a position now, you've been given a lot of opportunity  and money and you're, you're reaping the benefits of that.  So there's got to be some type of accountability that goes with it.  Whether you agree with it or not.  Right.  You can, you can agree to disagree, but you have to at least do that.  Kind of play the game.  Now it seems harder now for people too, because there's so many, I mean, this just happened  to be somebody saying something, but it seems like they're always out to get people doing  something wrong.  Whether you're a politician doing something sexual, it's like they're out to get you  and we're, we're kind of like a gotcha country now. 
[03:11:30]  Where the access is just unbelievable.  I mean, you know, if you, if you're out on, and TMZ gets you doing something, you know,  no matter what you do with your mouth, it can be dubbed into something.  Right.  Like there's so, there's so, everybody has access constantly to people and it's a frenzy.  It's a, there's a frenzy.  And I think it's really difficult.  Yeah.  There wasn't all, it was hard to get scandal out there like years ago.  Yeah.  They could cover it a little bit easier. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  What, how did they do it in the seventies or eighties?  It was really tough.  It's a, it's interesting because I was recently just on the Tonys and I had a huge debacle.  Like I, I live television.  I, I, I thought I was having a stroke because I was saying something, but I was reading something  else and I started to stutter and I, and I didn't do my intro and we hadn't rehearsed  it and he threw it at me at the last minute.  I was trying to be a good sport and, and I called my husband and I said, I don't know what  to do.  I just made a fool of myself on like in front of the whole Broadway community and, and 
[03:12:30]  I'm, I'm a professional.  I knew what I was doing, but they count.  It was a series of things that made me mess up, but I took it hard because I don't like  to mess up.  And he said, you know what?  Curse.  He said, if you get up there and curse, you'll get bleeped and that'll be a bigger story.  And it was an interesting, the psychology behind it was fascinating to me because it's  exactly what happened.  And so I got up there and I thought I need to regain this.  And the, the, the idea of me saying a bad word was so, it was, everybody was in such 
[03:13:00]  a up in arms and it was, it fascinated me because it just was, it was the biggest story.  It, it, what a brilliant point by him.  But like that's, your husband's pretty smart.  And she's like, he's so bright, like he's bright about all of that, but he, he just, you  know, he understood the psychology behind it.  And I thought after the fact, after I sort of regained my footing, I thought, wow, that's  really interesting.  Like really that that's noteworthy, me getting up there saying a bad word. 
[03:13:30]  What did you say?  And did you say that?  I did.  I just said, yeah, I mean, I just, and it was one of those things where I knew I would  get bleeped.  And so I feel a little bad that it was not as off the cuff, but, but at the same time,  I was like, you know what?  This is a survival business.  Like you survive because you're the only one out there.  And, but the fact that that was news, I thought, wow, this is how fascinating, you  know, what'd you say?  You don't have to.  Oh no, I just said, I just said shit.  Oh shit.  Okay.  I just said, oh, I thought it was going to be edited. 
[03:14:00]  And then I realized shit, it's live.  And then I, you know, kind of covered my mouth.  Are they giving us the rap?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  I'm going to yank her out of here.  Adamsfamilymusical.com.  A D D A M S family musical.  This Tuesday you can, uh, is her first live show.  And I'm really, I'm, I'm, I found out about this this week and I'm actually really going  to go see, I will.  I absolutely will.  It's a good, it's a good date night.  You guys will have.  Yeah.  How's that going?  Not good.  Not good. 
[03:14:30]  Not good.  You have any friends?  Maybe.  Oh, I, okay.  Now I know.  She's got some yoga friends.  They don't have to be.  Yeah.  Anybody.  They can be like one fifth as attractive as you.  They don't have to be on your level.  Just someone that might pair up well with me.  Low self-esteem.  The yoga is working for Brooke, by the way.  Fantastic.  Not to embarrass you, but you're, you're all right.  All right.  That's a very good compliment to give, Brooke Shields.  You're all right.  All right.  All right, Brooke.  She's beautiful and she's, you know, the yoga's working and doing great for her.  And once again, we didn't blow it.  We didn't screw up. 
[03:15:00]  No, we didn't.  I think she might come back for a third time.  I will.  A third time's a charm.  I think we'll get it.  The Addams Family on Broadway, Brooke Shields, this Tuesday all through the summer.  Great.  Brooke Shields, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  Continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You know it.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:15:30]  And look who's still here.  There's no more.  Your mics aren't on.  I don't have control over them right now.  Look who's still here.  Oh, thanks, Sam.  Go for it again.  Do you have a Facebook?  Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Roland.  And if Club Soda Kenny is here, you know what that means.  That means that the boss hasn't given him permission to leave, which means the boss is still here.  Why do you make me sound like an asshole, Sam? 
[03:16:00]  Well, you're Kenny's boss.  He's your, like, whipping boy.  And why does the 10 o'clock hour not sound like an Opie and Anthony show anymore?  It's not an Opie and Anthony show.  You tricked the bosses.  Well, they gave me the slot, right?  All of a sudden, I'm like, wait a minute.  10 o'clock hour is technically our time still, but I'm listening to Sam and Ron do an interview with Weird Aliyaki.  Like, they're booking guests, and they're not even talking about Opie and Anthony anymore.  Look.  You're kind of brilliant.  Thank you for saying that.  Because you got in the back door. 
[03:16:30]  You're like, no, man.  I'll, you know, I know the guys want to do a little less radio.  And, you know, no, I'll keep it going.  I'll play some bits and talk about O&A.  Yeah, I said.  And it'll be great.  And they agreed to that.  And now it's basically your show now.  Well, but you and Ant are on the show all the time.  You're obviously enjoying it.  So as long as you and Ant are happy.  I'm not saying it's bad.  Right.  It just has become something completely different.  And they didn't see it coming.  Like, I didn't have this in mind all along.  Like, Ronnie is like us.  He doesn't want to do more radio. 
[03:17:00]  But he comes in.  Yeah.  Because it gets him away from Fez for a little while.  I don't know what his motives are.  You know, he gets to kind of, like, do something a little different.  Yeah, everybody likes to do different things.  I'm doing something a little different right now.  I mean, you wanted to leave early today.  I did.  And I've officially kept here past 10 o'clock.  I did.  But we didn't want to blow off the Brooke Shields interview, who I'm just amazed she's a friend of the show.  And I'll say this.  Did you like my yoga body question?  Yeah.  I was trying to go for awkward.  More uncomfortableness. 
[03:17:30]  Why?  You're all right.  Yeah.  Hey, sweetie, that yoga's really working for you.  Did you see the yoga arms on her, though?  She was looking great.  Fucking well-defined, but not that Madonna ridiculousness.  No, she was looking fabulous.  Just a little, little, little definition in the arms.  At 6 o'clock, all the yoga girls are on the up west side.  What?  6 p.m. or a.m.?  6 o'clock.  What?  All the yoga people walk by the juice place?  Yeah, man.  Like, I was trying to not tell her which juice place, because now they know where she does yoga. 
[03:18:00]  I'm surprised you didn't make some kind of comment about her wearing yoga pants, because  I know you're a fan of the yoga pants.  What's wrong with yoga pants?  I didn't say anything was wrong with that.  You don't have to get defensive.  I'm just saying I know that that's something about you.  You enjoy a good pair of yoga pants on a lady.  Absolutely do.  The toe.  What do you enjoy besides wrestling?  Why would you get defensive?  What, do you enjoy wrestling pants?  I can't enjoy yoga pants?  I'm not attacking you.  It seemed like you were attacking me.  I was pointing out something that you liked.  Kenny, was he attacking me?  Who, prick face Sam? 
[03:18:30]  Sam's just, uh, Sam, uh, Kenny's just staring at you, and that's the first thing he said.  Well, Kenny's just because he's stupid.  Like, he's staring at me, and there's just wind passing through his ears.  Oh, wow, that's really brave of you.  Yeah.  Good one, prick face Sam.  Good one.  Say that on the sidewalk.  Why would I say it on the sidewalk?  Because you're protected by SiriusXM when you say shit like that with a live mic on.  Now, let's march outside, and you say the same thing to Kenny and see what happens.  I'm not going to attack Kenny off the air because it provides no enjoyment to the listeners. 
[03:19:00]  That's who I do this for.  Someone sounds like hoo-hoo.  The listeners.  Roland, I was going to say, we should give credit to where credit is due,  and realize that there were two A-list celebrities on this radio show today.  Roland bookings.  Way to go, Roland.  I was going to say, way to go, Opie, for approving them.  You know how to play the game.  Do you see what the common denominator is, Sam?  What?  He's eyeballing you, Sam.  What are you mad about? 
[03:19:30]  He's got issues with you.  He talks about you every day on the way home.  Did you hear yesterday how he belittled me yesterday on the show, too?  What did he do?  He just told everybody I was a disgrace.  Even doing commercials, too.  Well, I mentioned that Kenny had left his former position of employment in disgrace.  Why would you do that?  That's a touchy situation.  I saw it in the newspaper.  Made my wife cry.  Did she?  Yeah, they never recovered from that.  And he was bringing up his fodder? 
[03:20:00]  I saw it in the paper.  I didn't think it was private information.  What, a new article?  No.  Yeah.  Don't focus on the positive like my son getting Airman of the Week.  Right.  I didn't know he got Airman of the Week.  Yes, you did.  If you were to ask questions, you would know that Kenny's son got Airman of the Week, and  there's an article about it.  What good is going on in your life right now?  Nothing.  That was a good thing that was happening.  He just said nothing good is going on in his life right now.  My therapist wants me to be very positive, so I am. 
[03:20:30]  I am being more positive.  And are you really seeing a therapist?  What did I just say?  Yes.  How long have you been seeing...  Get this shit out of your ears!  How long have you been...  That's not positive.  How long have you been seeing a therapist for?  What's the difference?  Next question.  It's something that's interesting to the listeners.  What motivated you to see a therapist?  I'm fucked up.  Why does Sam get all the exclusives?  Kenny's going to the therapist.  Nobody knew this.  I knew for a long time.  I was just wondering if we were ever going to bring it up on the show.  Well, what you do is you lead people to admitting things about themselves.  Why would you give him that info when you could have done it for the boys? 
[03:21:00]  I led him to it.  Well, Prickface has a way of bringing the best out of people.  Thank you.  You get so annoyed that you just give up information.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right, Prickface?  First of all, that's not my name.  Oh, prime time.  Same difference.  And why weren't you brave enough to bring up with Weird Al that we kind of beat him  up recently on our show?  Yeah, he's not brave.  You should have heard the shitty interview you did with the mob wise, too.  Because I'm not going to invite people into the studio when it's under my watch and say, 
[03:21:30]  hey, by the way, you know who doesn't like you?  Like, that's just a rude thing to do to somebody.  But you're at the connection of the O.B. and Anthony show, which beat him up for over  an hour.  But now I feel guilty because I respect Ronnie B.  Uh-huh.  And Ronnie was talking, I was listening yesterday, and Ronnie was talking about how quick Weird  Al is because he's good and unmasked with him.  Yes.  And Ronnie actually said Weird Al was one of the quickest guys he ever interviewed.  Yeah, he said he was quicker than a lot of the comedians.  Really quick as far as, you know, coming up with funny lines and stuff.  And I went, damn it, man. 
[03:22:00]  We had it all wrong with this Weird Al.  Did you hear Eric's James Blunt question?  Why would I?  He's literally, when I'm talking to Weird Al, and I'm saying, well, most people, you  know, your parodies aren't vicious.  I'm surprised when people have problems with you.  While Weird Al is answering, Eric says into my headphones, James Blunt song.  As if I know anything about what he's talking about.  Did he beat up James Blunt pretty bad, honestly?  I guess he made a song called You're Pitiful and Atlantic Records instead of You're Beautiful.  Right.  And Atlantic Records didn't like it.  So at a concert that Eric went to, Weird Al put a t-shirt on that said, Atlantic Records 
[03:22:30]  sucks.  Ooh, that's edgy.  But I'm supposed to know that because I was sitting with Eric at the concert?  Like, why wouldn't Eric ask the question?  Yeah, why doesn't E-Rock ask questions?  Because it's not my show.  You get to be, it's everybody's show.  Technically, it's not Sam's show.  Technically, it is Sam's show.  No, no.  I mean, no.  You've made it your show.  Technically, it's not your show.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's keep the facts straight.  I was told it's his show.  What did Jeff Berlin say right before we got on the air? 
[03:23:00]  Technically, it's everyone's show.  Here's your host, primetime Sam Roberts.  That's what Jeff Berlin said.  But you just snuck that in there.  Jeff Berlin did it.  He's the voiceover guy.  No, I snuck that in there.  Well, I mean, I don't, he doesn't.  I would do the same exact thing, but the facts are, it's technically not your show.  You made it your show.  Technically, it wasn't designed to be my show, but technically it has become my show.  I feel like I had to stay late today just so people know that this hour is still connected  with the Opie and Anthony, you know, show.  Loosely now.  Very loosely.  Very loosely. 
[03:23:30]  First of all, it's a guest we would never book, although now I feel guilty that we didn't  talk to Weird Al because I think we blew it on that one.  And then you also got a co-host, this Ronnie B guy.  Yeah, Ronnie B.  And there's no O and A bits anymore.  Well, we played a bit or two yesterday.  And then you get a different Roland.  I'm like, who's that guy?  Because when Roland comes on our show, he's a very different, timid Roland.  Well, he's a wise-ass on your show.  I hate to be the guy to tell you this.  Then don't.  People are very stressed.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  People are very stressed out coming in this studio from 6 to 10. 
[03:24:00]  And they're not stressed out coming in here from 10 to 11.  Oh, name names.  Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan brings goodness to this show.  He told me that he gets-  I'm getting a lot of props on Troy Kwan later.  Yeah.  His stock is a rising.  Yeah, he's been doing great.  But he's very stressed out when he comes in here.  Sterniolo and-  Sterniolo.  Sterniolo and Joy.  And that's, by the way, Sterniolo is a star that was first discovered on After Open  I Know.  I know.  I know that.  But that's what we bring everybody in.  We see what we get out of people. 
[03:24:30]  Did you get him on the air yet to talk about the latest push-up contest?  Yep.  I got him on-  Yesterday?  Yesterday.  No, no, the day before yesterday.  He's out of his mind, right?  He went crazy on E-Rock.  He started screaming at him all over again.  Once again.  Oh, also Pete Dominick called Eric an idiot.  Oh, yeah.  Pete Dominick.  I told him during the afternoon.  He's not here yet.  But he started yelling at E-Rock in the hallway about what an idiot he is.  And I apologize for being obsessed with this.  But it amazes me that the kid won't do 18 push-ups for 180 bucks.  And then $10 for every push-up he does after 18. 
[03:25:00]  Like, who wouldn't take that bet?  I think you too.  I would try.  I still try.  Beyond that-  Who the fuck wouldn't do that?  You offered him $1,000.  Well, that's off the table.  I'm not messing around anymore.  But he still said no.  By the way, I'm in training.  For what?  To take out Mars.  MMA?  No, Mars says he could do 60.  I'm not really-  Wait, I'll wake him up.  Mars.  Mars.  Mars is in-  Another shot from Rowan.  Well, another shot from Rowan.  No, Mars starts his fiesta at what?  Tent? 
[03:25:30]  Siesta.  Oh, fiesta's what?  Party.  Thank you for the introduction, Gordito.  Hey!  Oh, gracias, pendejo, cabron, piche madre.  Con pendejo, la ramputa.  Oh, shit.  Yo, she just said su madre.  Hopi, you want to know what's really going on behind the scenes?  Wow, you guys could do that?  Yeah.  I want to hear more of that.  I could tell that the maricon con pendejo.  Let me tell you-  Su padre su madre con con mi pipi.  See, he doesn't even know how to speak Spanish.  It doesn't make sense.  I could do it, too.  Taco Bell.  You want to know what's really going on behind the scenes?  Mars has picked up on the fact that whether he's in studio or not, every time his name 
[03:26:00]  comes up, Rowan takes a shot at him, and it's gotten under Mars' skin on a legitimate  level, not just in good humor.  He's annoyed that Rowan keeps taking shots at him.  I'm going back at him in humor, and on the show, I'll go back at him outside.  But you don't like that when you're not in here, he's still taking shots at you.  I'm used to it now.  But you don't like it.  I'm used to it.  He doesn't.  I didn't do that.  Where's my wallet?  But anyway, Mars, why do you have a problem with everybody here? 
[03:26:30]  He does end up with problems with everybody.  Who the fuck says that?  You have a problem with Rowan.  They're talking behind the back.  The other day, you said Jim was peer pressuring you.  You got a problem with everybody all of a sudden.  Anyway, getting back to the push-ups.  Avoid the topic.  Avoid it.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.  Can you move your phone this way?  Can you make sense?  It should be, I do 60 push-ups before I stop.  Wait, you could do more than 60?  Yeah.  Can you do 60 right now?  No, I just finished doing 300.  Mars was in the army, Sam. 
[03:27:00]  They just said I just finished doing 300 today.  The army's called San Quentin?  Have you done 70?  My limit is 70.  I want to push 70.  I could do 90 push-ups in two minutes.  Oh, I'm done.  Without stopping?  No.  No, no.  I said I could do 60 without stopping.  Can you do more than 60 right now?  No.  All right.  I'm in training.  I'm officially in training.  It's going to go down one of these days.  Without stopping?  Yeah, I understand.  I did the 51. 
[03:27:30]  Okay.  But I was fucking shot.  I got to get in a little more shape.  How long is it going to take you?  To get in shape?  Yeah.  A month.  One month.  I'm a little soft right now.  Okay.  It's a July competition.  I can see that.  Huh?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  He's using what I say to him on me.  I know what he did there.  Oh, Brown Noser has finally taken some shots.  Come on, put your own shit.  You're taking my shit and using it against me.  That's my line.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I've said that a million times to you.  Okay.  But fair enough.  It was a good line. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  I mean, Mars is a little chubby for an MMA guy.  Am I disturbing your guest, Sam?  Who is that?  Brooke Shields.  She should come in.  No, no, no.  We did the Brooke Shields thing.  We could get a different side of her.  Yeah, of course we can.  Well, I mean, we did after opening it.  But what does all this have to do with my videos?  Well, it doesn't have anything to do with your videos.  Nobody was talking about them.  You know what was great the other day, G.H.?  What, Kenny?  That big compliment Tom Papa gave you about the Central Park video.  Yeah, but Roland hinted that he told Tom Papa to do that.  You were listening?  Yeah, I picked up on that. 
[03:28:30]  No.  No.  Tom Papa's sincere.  Did Tom Papa do it on his own?  Tom Papa did it on his own.  But Roland hinted.  I saw that.  Roland was pointing at himself and nodding.  And pointing at his head like, I made him say that.  And pointing at his head like, my great idea.  I saw what you did, Roland.  I didn't do that.  Not for Tom Papa.  For who?  What?  For who?  No, I didn't do that.  You said not for Tom Papa.  Yeah, I didn't do it for Tom Papa.  No.  Why did you point at your head then?  I don't know.  Did he have an itch?  He is.  Look, I'm bald.  It happens.  I still have a mess.  He is a sweaty bald guy.  My stomach itches. 
[03:29:00]  My balls itches.  I don't know.  What the fuck's going on?  Can I talk to the morning mashup on this show today?  I know you...  Oh, wait.  They were yelling at each other in the hallway.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah.  Stanley was screaming at Nicole.  Because I know you don't like them on this show.  You bring them in and I'm out of here.  All right.  Well, then we'll wait.  I got a real problem with those people.  Why is that?  Because they just play hits.  Well, they have to.  I mean, less talk, more music, right?  They do like...  So then why do you need six people?  They have four.  And they do like two and a half minute talk breaks.  No, because some of them do different names and stuff.  Like, oh.  Stanley Sack. 
[03:29:30]  See?  That's just a segment that Stan does.  But that's a different guy.  No, it's not.  So he's representing two different people as one guy.  Stanley Sack is Stan's sack.  Yeah, he's black.  So why doesn't he just say Stanley T?  No, he's taking out his sack.  So then he's Stanley Sack and he's Stanley T.  He is not the sack.  He possesses the sack.  He dresses like his mom dresses him every morning with the big shorts and the weird teeth.  I don't know anything about that.  That's what Sam said in the after show.  What are you talking about?  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're going to be a victim of a drive-by with that shit, man. 
[03:30:00]  That's not nice.  Yeah, Roland.  Is that true, Mark?  You know those people.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Roland is just...  He's just looking to deflect whatever he gets.  I see his mind working.  And when it goes to him, his eyes start moving.  And then he goes, where can I go?  Where can I go?  He's not that quick that you can't tell.  All right.  So, yes, Sam.  My latest video.  All right.  I'll talk about it for a second.  It might be Robin Williams in Drag in the Park.  Yes, dancing.  With the yellow beard?  Yes.  People said you might have got Robin Williams doing some weird shit. 
[03:30:30]  This is amazing because you already got Barbra Streisand at the bus stop.  Yes.  That's my thing.  And now you found Robin Williams dancing in the park.  Yeah, that is a great video.  Yes, because you're asking.  It might be Fez.  But I thought it was Robin Williams.  Now that Fez is not on the Ron and Fez show, I might have caught Fez in the park.  I'm not sure if it's Fez or Robin Williams.  Yes.  All right.  Fine.  I'll talk about it.  Where can people even see these videos?  On YouTube.  Everybody knows.  And a great person makes a great cameo in that video we're speaking of.  Who?  The dog poop?  Oh, did you like that part? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Who's the cameo?  You got to watch OP Radio on YouTube.  Oh, the username is what?  OP Radio.  Oh, okay.  Did I stutter?  I was trying to get a second plug out, bitch.  Biatch.  Why the attitude?  Because.  He's a quick face.  He's got a chip on your shoulder.  We brought you up in this business.  Now why the attitude?  I don't have an attitude towards you.  There was a little bit of an attitude there.  That's why I came in here.  Because I heard this motherfucker mouthing off at you.  When?  Before.  Just now.  What did I say? 
[03:31:30]  Look at you.  I'm mouthing off at you, dummy.  You do it to everybody.  You can learn something about loyalty through this man right there.  Thank you very much.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You should hear what he says when you're not here.  You're foolish.  You can learn loyalty and we can buy Rosetta Stone.  Why would Mars need Rosetta Stone?  Because he's a dummy.  He don't know what the fuck he's talking about.  Rosetta Stone is how people learn Spanish.  He already knows Spanish.  Mars, could you teach my kid some dirty Spanish?  Yes.  Because he might need a second language in this world.  OP.  OP.  You don't want Mars around your kid.  Remember the Hispanic thing?  All right.  That was only uncles. 
[03:32:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, but you're an uncle to something.  Exactly.  So technically, you're an uncle.  Well, uncle to their nieces and nephews.  Plus, it's like...  That's where the problem lies.  You know, you work with Mars.  Mars comes over.  Hey, it's Uncle Mars, everybody.  Uh-oh.  So, Sam, yes, it's really important that you do stay to the end of my videos because there's  always a little special treat at the end.  And the latest special treat might be a cameo from Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  That's amazing.  Yes.  I call it a little something-something.  Do you?  Kenny, what's your problem with me? 
[03:32:30]  You are the one with the problem with me.  You made my wife cry yesterday.  Why did she cry?  Tell her not to listen.  Because you're bringing up some old stuff that no one wants to talk about anymore.  So what?  So don't talk about it.  Just because you ran out of time after the Weird Al interview.  Yeah.  The Weird Al interview went to the end of the show.  Oh, but then before that.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sorry if I made your wife cry, but there was nothing to cry about.  All right.  I accept your apology.  So fucking relax over there.  Oh, my God. 
[03:33:00]  What the fuck?  Kenny, are you going to take that shit?  Who, from Madison Square Gaga?  That's what the shirt says.  It's not even a shot at me.  My T-shirt actually says that.  But why are you wearing a Lady Gaga shirt?  Because I went to the show and enjoyed it.  Because you're a faggot?  Oh, bro.  Good one.  Tracy Morgan.  Why don't you keep it on paris?  Is that bad?  Yeah, you're going to be fired.  Calling someone?  Yes!  Is that bad?  Have you been so stupid?  Have you turned on a TV lately?  He can't read, so it's okay.  No, he made comments about it.  Did he just say, is that bad? 
[03:33:30]  Wait a minute.  You really are a stupid guy.  Look, in the old days, we were allowed to do that and we weren't even thinking gay.  But now you can't really say that shit.  Not even gay?  What?  That's gay?  I mean, you could put it in the right context.  Look, we obviously still do it and wanted to still do it.  We don't mean anything by it.  It's just a bunch of guys talking.  But the fact is, it's a rough one right now, man.  Okay, so I'll stay away from that.  We've learned something.  What do you mean by... 
[03:34:00]  That might be tough for you.  What do you mean by he's a faggot?  Yeah.  Now I've got to be careful, because if I define faggot the way I was using it...  Well, how are you using it?  Yeah, how are you using it?  Let's be honest.  He's wearing a Lady Gaga shirt and you said something like he's a faggot.  He's a little monster and he just...  Kids are little monsters, too.  Well, what do you mean by that?  Look at the way he is.  He's not manly, like a real man.  What, like I'm not like I need to lose a few pounds like Mars?  Do you mean he's gay? 
[03:34:30]  Not to grow up.  Do you mean he's gay?  No, bring up the barrette in his hair.  Yeah, that shit, too.  Scrunchy in your hair?  There's no barrette or scrunchy in my hair.  There's a band that I tie it back with.  I think you picked the wrong color is the problem people have.  Fucking red.  Jess said she liked red.  It's a girl's color.  I don't mind that.  I mean, I'm pretty secure in my masculinity that I can pull off a red headband.  It's bright red.  I mean, I'm sorry it's not a free t-shirt, Mars, but...  I feel sorry for Jess.  We all make...  Ooh.  I feel sorry for your nieces. 
[03:35:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  That's why they stay away from me.  Oh, what?  Okay, now he's admitting to child abuse.  Anyway.  Oh, but you want to hear a secret?  What?  Troy has heard you on the air repeatedly say, and you said it again today, that's why I bring  it up, that you're thinking about smoking pot again?  Six years already you've been saying that.  Troy wants to smoke you up bad.  No.  Like, he said, if you ever invite him anywhere...  Jay Moore gave me something.  What did he give you?  Just an envelope. 
[03:35:30]  What's in the envelope?  I don't know.  I haven't opened it yet.  When did he give it to you?  When he was doing Law and Order.  What's in it?  I don't know.  I didn't open it up yet.  Why don't you take a look?  Where is the envelope?  It's in my house.  Why can't we see it?  Because I don't know what's in it yet.  Troy wants to smoke you up.  No.  Hey, look.  Send me a cow.  I get that.  Okay, I got that.  I'm not going to smoke pot with a hipster.  You don't like Troy that much.  I like Troy.  But socially...  I don't understand the hipster thing.  So socially, like, as a work...  What does that have to do with smoking pot? 
[03:36:00]  He doesn't like your ideals, so he doesn't want to be that too...  And the new stuff's really strong, right?  Oh, I'd get, like, ridiculous shit.  Well, then you'd try to put it in my butt, probably.  Why would you give me ridiculous shit unless you were going to do some harm to me?  Troy, would you try to have sex with Opie if you got him high?  I would not, no.  Okay.  No.  I thought that should be addressed.  So why are we getting ridiculous shit?  What are we doing after we got high?  Well, I don't know.  You know, because we were talking about...  What would we do after we got high together?  No, because we were talking about you going to see...  Why do I need ridiculous shit if I haven't smoked pot? 
[03:36:30]  And I'm embarrassed to say this because it makes me sound really old.  20 years.  Because it's...  You were 10?  10.  Well, yeah.  17.  Wow.  It's just real good, clean, high grade.  See, like...  But if I hadn't smoked it that long, why would it matter if it was ridiculous or not?  It could be shitty and I'm going to do all right.  You can just take one or two hits, but it'll just be like a nice, clean eye.  And then what do we do?  Well, because we were talking about going to a concert.  You watch cartoons.  And I said, if I ever went to a concert with Opie, I'd get him ripped.  What concert? 
[03:37:00]  I don't know.  Something cool.  Like, what's going to Rihanna?  What do you consider cool?  Sound of the way that you're into?  Foo Fighters?  You too?  Yeah, exactly.  If Foo Fighters are playing or anything.  That's November.  That's a long time.  I'm just okay with Foo Fighters.  Troy would want to take you to some, like, electronic show or some hipster.  There's like a hipster thing.  You wouldn't dig that.  Yeah, why don't you dubstep on down there?  Or Williamsburg with glow sticks.  I know what that is.  Or Troy would take you to Williamsburg with a bunch of glow sticks.  Oh, like a gay club? 
[03:37:30]  No.  That Williamsburg ball.  That's what they have, like, the electronic with glow sticks.  If I don't know what the Williamsburg ball is, what do you think the status that most  of the listeners know what that is is?  Fine.  It's a hip event.  Nobody knows what that is.  Yeah, but it's Brooklyn.  We're a national show.  What's wrong with glow sticks?  Nothing's wrong with glow sticks.  Rave kids like glow sticks.  If there's glow sticks around, there's going to be some girl rubbing up against you.  Are you saying that what you're counting on?  She's probably on ecstasy.  Troy, tell them.  Yeah.  Nice.  If there's glow sticks, that means they're on the E or the ecstasy, whatever the fuck the 
[03:38:00]  kids call now.  I didn't take a position.  The kids call now, and then they have to rub up against you.  Yeah.  Or Troy can take you to the 675 bar on Tuesday.  I didn't take a position against glow sticks for the record.  I mean, I'm fine with glow sticks.  You kind of thought it was kind of wimpy and lame.  I didn't.  But the girls will rub up against you.  I'll take that into consideration next time I criticize glow sticks.  And if you happen to have a boner at that point, it could be a good thing.  Tell them, Troy.  Yeah.  If you have an erection in a club and you rub it against a girl, she'll like it?  Well, if she's on ecstasy, quite possibly. 
[03:38:30]  No, you let them rub up against you.  Yeah, exactly.  If you rub up against them, then there's going to be problems.  But you can't be on ecstasy because you won't get a boner.  So that would totally...  But you've got to go into one of these places and make them believe you're on ecstasy so  they feel like you're on ecstasy.  Yeah, you're on their level.  But you're faking it so that way you still get the erection.  Right.  So the girls will back their shit up right into you.  Well, Troy DJs every Tuesday at the meatpacking.  Yeah.  And when Troy DJs, he gets chicks wet.  Do you?  He said there's tons of chicks at 675.  Do chicks get wet when they hear your music? 
[03:39:00]  They haven't told me that they...  So you don't know...  Yes or no.  You don't know...  Right.  Fact or fiction on that.  Exactly.  Okay.  But you said there's a lot chicks there.  Oh, yeah.  It's a cool spot.  Troy, you're flaming.  Flaming?  You know...  That's in reference.  Most people would take that to mean gay.  That's Mars over there giggling like...  That's why Mars giggles.  But the fact is you're wearing a low V-neck and you've got some flames popping out.  So you're flaming.  I'm the same in heart with wings.  See what I did there?  That's the brilliance of me.  Yeah.  I got a laugh from Mars because he thought something else. 
[03:39:30]  And I said something very safe.  You know Mars is very simple, right?  Oh, quite.  Like, it's not that much of an accomplishment to get a laugh from Mars.  Mars, you're kind of simple.  We know that.  He's a simple guy.  There's nothing wrong with being simple.  I enjoy myself.  Yeah.  It's easy, right?  It's easy to have a good time.  Mars, say something that'll blow us away right now.  One, two, three.  Where'd we go?  Roland nailed you on that one, Mars.  Did he really?  Yeah, he nailed you on that one.  Yeah, you're not smart enough to understand.  Say something...  Okay, now he's a good one too old. 
[03:40:00]  Thank you.  Say something that'll blow us away.  You're like, I can't fucking believe Mars just said that today in the 10 o'clock hour.  Go for it, Mars.  Blow us away with anything.  Knowledge.  Anything.  I got nothing for you.  Last time you were in here, you blew us away with the revelation that you touch your nieces  or whatever that was.  I don't remember specifically.  I do not touch my nieces.  We'll go forward with that though.  What's today's big thing?  I do not touch my nieces.  Blow us away, Mars.  And let's get this straight.  No, no, no.  We're talking about the next thing now.  The deal with the Hispanics.  Oh my God.  Not again with this bullshit.  They love their kids.  Okay?  They love their kids. 
[03:40:30]  They love them so much they want to share their love with other family members.  Mars.  According to you.  They pimp them out.  Mars, you eat pussy?  All the time.  All right, talk about it.  Look, Mars, blow us away with something.  I've got nothing to blow you away with.  All right, well then tell us, other than KFC and Popeyes, what's a fast food chicken restaurant?  No, I'll tell you what, man.  I don't know how the hell you're letting that motherfucker, Opie, pronounce the restaurant name. 
[03:41:00]  I don't know how you let Sam talk down to you and just like-  I don't talk down to Opie.  To all of us.  I talk down to you, but I'm not going to try it.  Have your own battle.  I will.  Exactly.  Yeah, nice try, dummy.  Mars, you eat ass?  It might be a trick question, Mars.  I know, right?  Do you, Mars?  Is that too complicated of a question for you?  Uh, not just any old ass.  Do you eat ass in general?  Have you eaten ass?  Yes.  And you eat ass?  As I eat ass.  Kenny, what's the response then?  So what's the response? 
[03:41:30]  Mars, if a queer jumped on your back, would you let him stay or jerk him off?  Kenny, that's not appropriate for this hour.  I don't put up with that kind of talk on this show.  That was Club Soda Kenny, for the record, not the viewpoint of this show.  I don't put up with that on after Opie and Anthony Live.  I don't know what year you're used to.  Mars, what's the name of the restaurant?  What restaurant?  It's not KFC.  It's not Popeyes, but they do serve fast food chicken.  Pollo Tropical. 
[03:42:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  A playa Loco.  No, no, no.  You know what I'm talking about.  Why does he have to lean in to speak Spanish?  It's the weirdest thing.  He's not good with mic technique.  He's a natural-born engineer.  But when he does English, he's got the proper distance.  But he leans in when he does the Spanish.  Like there's a kid in front of them.  Do you ever listen to the Spanish radio stations?  They're deeper.  They speak like this.  You know what it is, Opie?  He has no idea how these microphones work.  Which is weird for an engineer.  Oh, man, I would love to choke that little fucker out.  Choke me then.  No, I can't do it.  Exactly.  Shut the fuck up. 
[03:42:30]  Wow.  That's rough.  You're in a rough position now.  We are adults.  We communicate with words.  You're fucking mental bullies, but you are.  Well, I'm sorry if you can't keep up with me.  But we communicate with words here.  Shut the fuck up.  He's keeping up with you.  Apparently, it's taking you this long to respond to it.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  Why do you got problems with Mars?  I'm just picking on him today.  Plus, he won't give me the name of the restaurant.  You know what restaurant I'm talking about.  Boya Tropicana.  No, no, no, no.  It's American.  They're closed on Sundays.  You love them.  They come up here for Chicken Sandwich Day. 
[03:43:00]  I'll say it.  Don't say it because Mars can't pronounce the name.  You know what Mars' favorite movie is?  What?  West Side Story.  Why is that?  He's cracking himself up.  He's cracking himself up.  Why?  Why is that?  Look who's joining the party.  Sam.  You don't even move over? 
[03:43:30]  We just freed up our mic.  Wait, he doesn't even move over?  Yeah, he's going to move.  Thank you.  He's going to move over.  Let's trade.  No, it's not trading.  It's called moving out of his way.  You know, we traded.  You know, Opa.  Ronnie, it's great to see you.  It's good to see you.  You know you created a monster with this kid, right?  Well, yeah, yeah.  He started to turn on me, too, which is wonderful.  Well, the strange thing about it is that the feedback that I get from listeners is just hate right now.  Yeah, yeah.  And I go, well, sometimes that works because at least it's energy, and then you can flip it. 
[03:44:00]  Obviously, you bought a lot out of Goodwill yesterday, bringing Weird Al in here.  You know, who doesn't love him?  Well, we didn't love him until I heard what you said.  I don't know if you were listening to this hour.  No, I can't.  You turned me around on Weird Al because I thought what he did was pretty easy.  He's made a great living, okay?  No, no, no.  Here's the interesting thing.  Yeah.  A lot of guys do that, and he's the only Weird Al, though.  True.  But how you turned me, you said you did it unmasked and said he was one of the quickest guys you've ever talked to. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, and I was waiting for it to be kind of a boring hour, and he's legitimately a funny guy.  He just puts it in that strange fucking realm.  Do you think he wants to be doing more?  No.  I think he's very happy.  He knows what he's got.  I think he loves it.  He's got over, like, a million Twitter followers and all that kind of shit.  Yeah, I know.  Who am I to say?  Of course.  But I just always thought it was a simple thing.  That's all.  But here's the thing about it.  Yeah, it is somewhat of a simple thing, but why, for like 35 fucking years, is he the only song parody guy? 
[03:45:00]  I know you've never worked anywhere without the Weird Al clone.  They've been in every fucking station, that guy in the Hawaiian shirt.  And a mustache.  What did you say yesterday?  Because he picks hit songs to redo, and, oh, fuck, what was the line?  It was classic.  I shouldn't have went there, because now I'm fucked it all up.  No, no, we've got plenty of time to wait for you.  No, no, no.  I know it's going to be good.  I know it's going to be there.  You're used to waiting for people to fucking move on. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, gee, see.  Was that my fault, too?  No, but just the fact that you bring it up goes to show, the flashlight comes back on again.  And here's the thing that you don't understand, Sam.  Okay.  You're under Opie's protection, and everybody fucking sees that.  For whatever reason, Opie goes, oh, I like this kid.  Someday, you know, Opie will get hit by a truck, and people are going to come after you with knives.  What did I do to anybody?  I'm not going to go through fucking details for you, because that's what you do.  You try to bring... 
[03:46:00]  It's up to you to figure it out.  Yeah.  And then that also, that would lead to me setting up things where other human beings have had their fucking feelings hurt.  And there's this...  And again, it's nothing against you.  You're clawing your way up.  I get the whole thing.  You know, you're like, oh, I'm in over my head.  What do I have to do to make things work?  I get it.  You know, it's like a junior shock jock.  I think it works out well for you.  Who did you guys have on today?  Oh, my God.  We had Elijah Wood.  Kind of starstruck.  I'm not going to lie to you. 
[03:46:30]  Every once in a while, you look at one of these guests and go, holy shit.  But what is it about Elijah Wood for you?  Lord of the Rings.  That was a masterpiece.  I can't fucking sit through it.  I don't understand.  You've never sat through Lord of the Rings.  I've tried.  I've tried.  I think all three.  I'm not an action movie guy, by the way, in general.  A lot of action in that movie, but it's a masterpiece.  Yeah, I don't...  You know, I think it has to do with fantasy for me.  Like, science fiction, I'm okay with if it's science.  But if there's, like, fucking dragons and wizards and shit, I'm just like a fucking bad Led Zeppelin song to me.  I'm like, I don't know what to tell you. 
[03:47:00]  A guy with a long beard died.  I don't know.  You know, there's darknesses come over the kingdom.  Do you watch the Lord of the Rings stuff?  Yeah, I did.  I know it's really big.  I mean, I wasn't, like, a super fan, like a Trekkie for Lord of the Rings, but there's huge movies.  No, that doesn't...  Yeah, well, there's a lot of...  Do you know what?  Right now, I just found this out yesterday.  The number 10 movie of all time just came out, that fucking Pirates 4.  Right.  I don't know a human being who's seen Pirates 4.  No, number 10 of all time?  Number 10 of all time.  It's made over a billion dollars this year around the world. 
[03:47:30]  No.  It's made three times more money outside of this country than it.  I gave up on those movies after maybe the first.  I was in for the second, and then I was...  I'm halfway through the second you were in for, and then you're like, I don't know who...  I think that's what happened to me.  I think I did get through half the second, and I really liked the first movie, but I have no desire to keep watching them.  But once they got the snake face and all those...  And the ghosts are running around on the ship.  Yeah, I don't even know what you're talking about.  I've been gone before that.  Yes.  But Elijah, whatever he does, he'll always be known for Lord of the Rings above anything else. 
[03:48:00]  He's always welcome to Comic-Con.  That's what we were kind of thinking.  If it goes bad, he's got a career.  But it's pretty amazing that he was known as the kid from all the movies.  He was known as a child star, and now he's found something else that he's known for.  Well, what was he first known for?  I would say...  He was in The Good Son, believe it or not.  He was Macaulay Culkin's...  So he was like tiny then.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  See, here's the weird thing.  It's like a lot of...  In the old days...  I'm only talking about like 20, 30 years ago. 
[03:48:30]  If you were a kid star, that was the end of you.  Right.  But now all these people were kid stars.  Just about everybody you know has been...  You know, if they're 30, they've been acting for like 27 years.  Yeah.  It's no longer a bad thing to have been on the Mickey Mouse Club.  Sure.  It's fucking neat.  Child star is not a term really anymore.  Right.  Child star means you were really famous, and now you're a complete fuck-up.  Right.  And you don't get that anymore.  What are all those kids in the 70s?  Well, I don't think they had any training.  I think they just picked cute kids. 
[03:49:00]  Right.  Where now...  Oh, good point.  Now I think it's like...  They're trained.  Yeah.  They're like little fucking chess prodigies.  They're right.  You know, like, stay with it.  Do it.  Don't fucking...  You know, no one ever thinks, all right, I'm 13, I've made a million dollars.  How much heroin can I put in my own?  Just...  I think I can put a lot in it.  That is true, because Elijah, in like 94, Roger Ebert said that Elijah Wood was the greatest  actor of his age group or whatever, like he was a phenomenal actor for that age.  Right.  And then he said, good, Ryan Dunn's dead.  Good. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Fuck Ebert.  You had every right to say what he did, but relax.  Well, it's...  How much attention do you need?  You got to jump on that right away.  The thing is, everyone knows.  You don't need to fucking say it.  Yeah, we all knew what it was going to be, but a lot of people were, you know, severely  bummed out.  Right.  It's almost like if someone's mom died and you show up at the funeral, like, I used to  worry.  I knew she was 350 pounds.  Yeah.  Figured diabetes.  Yeah.  Just shut the fuck up.  Give it a day or two.  Everyone knows it.  You don't need to fucking teach a lesson to anyone right now. 
[03:50:00]  At that moment.  Yeah.  There'll be plenty of time to teach your little fucking lesson to people about drinking and  driving.  I thought the funniest line is, bam, like, immediately put out, why don't you shut your fat fucking  mouth to a guy with no jaw?  That was classic.  It was just like, the guy.  Do you think he knew?  No, bam doesn't fucking, you know.  I didn't think so either.  When that news came out, bam was just fucking tattooing, you know, some skateboard across  his arm.  Yeah.  Hey, we also had Brooke Shields in today.  How's Brooke doing?  She's, uh.  She's all right. 
[03:50:30]  We got weird in here.  Did it get weird?  Yeah.  No, it didn't get weird.  See, I haven't seen.  I just want to acknowledge that she had a nice yoga body.  The thing for me is I'm a huge fan of hers.  But that goes back to Harry and the Hendersons.  When that happened, I saw her in the hall one day and couldn't believe how long that  woman is.  You should have heard how Opie ended the interview, though.  He said, because earlier in the interview, he said, I saw you on your way to yoga once.  And then that just kind of let it sit there.  And she was like, all right.  And then he wanted to increase the awkwardness.  Well, I was just trying. 
[03:51:00]  I was going for awkward.  Yeah.  So why are you playing my cards?  He's fucking Perez.  That's his fucking thing.  You are, aren't you?  I want it was on the radio.  I want you to know the way you're doing it.  I like people to just go, wow, that was awkward out thinking that maybe I was going for awkward.  But you said it just like 20 minutes ago.  You said you're going for awkward on the air.  That was 20 minutes ago.  Oh, but what?  Why?  What are you doing with the flashlight in here trying to say this is the way Opie works?  Because I didn't want Opie.  Opie was about to address this and I didn't want him to have to set up his own thing.  I don't know.  Sometimes for me, it seems just like you feel like you're doing a director's voiceover and 
[03:51:30]  just let the words speak for itself.  Well, do you want to talk about...  I just wanted to comment about her that she looked good because she's been doing a lot  of yoga.  That's all.  Can I explain what he means by that?  Yeah, I got it.  Okay.  He said the yoga, whatever, I see you're doing the yoga.  You're doing good.  You look all right.  I said you look all right.  But he said like you're looking all right.  I want to say that she looked hot.  I wanted to go for hot and you're a piece of ass for your age, but I didn't want to like 
[03:52:00]  be rude.  You said the yoga's working.  I said you're looking all right.  The yoga's looking all right.  You're looking all right.  Does anybody know?  It's got to be mid-40s.  Yeah.  The weird thing about Brooke Shields, when she was like, I don't know, like nine, she did  a lot of nude scenes in movies.  Pretty Baby.  And Pretty Baby, of course, is the famous, you know, like full frontal for a little girl.  Well, but then she did a George Burns movie where her ass was out in a fucking comedy.  Wow.  And I'm like, if this happened today, they would come and arrest everybody that was on 
[03:52:30]  the fucking set.  Of course.  They don't be brought up on child pedophilia charges.  But at that time, they were like, hey, this is what you're known for, honey.  You might as well do it here for a comedy or else you're out.  I felt like I was Ronnie B today when I was interviewing.  Yeah?  Yeah, because I go, hey, Brooke, do you even remember a time where you weren't famous?  And I'm thinking, that's something Ronnie B would have asked.  But then you told her she looked all right and the yoga's really working for you.  Hey, why would you have to do that?  I had a moment. 
[03:53:00]  I'm sharing a moment with Ronnie B.  I didn't say we didn't do a bad job.  I was basically saying, look, Ronnie, I could fucking raise the level when I have to.  And then you have to bring it back down as dopey-opey with the fucking awkward shit.  It's not dopey.  You did it on purpose.  I had a moment today where I'm like, you know what?  I think I got a good question finally.  Brooke, do you remember ever not being famous?  You're a multifaceted performer.  Yeah, but then you had to bring it down.  This annoyance that you feel, you create it, Opie.  Because there's no reason that you couldn't take any one of your guys and have them do the fucking after show. 
[03:53:30]  This is the payback, right?  Yeah, they should all.  Maybe Danny should do it one day.  E-Rock should do it one day.  I've invited everybody in here.  No, no, not invited with you.  A fucking revolving thing of hosts.  Nobody wanted to do it.  Right, but now –  I call it brilliant on his part, though, I have to say, because he – this was supposed to be a show that was hosted by whoever, but he made it his own.  That's brilliant.  And nobody wanted to host this show on our staff. 
[03:54:00]  Well, now let's have another election and see if people are out there because I've talked to a lot of people who would like to do it.  But, I mean, you say it's brilliant, and it's very brilliant in a Machiavellian way, like the guy behind the guy.  Like, I don't know about that.  I don't know, Opie.  But I turned this show into something that would be worth hosting, and now people might want to.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you for what you've done.  So now you should fight for it.  I am fighting for it.  That's what I'm doing right now.  Well, we've got to, like, audition other people before you fight for it.  You can audition whoever you want.  That's what Ronnie's saying.  I say we just spin the wheel, make the deal, and make it one of those things where the people have to be in there. 
[03:54:30]  Wow, spin the wheel.  Yeah.  And then every day you don't know who's going to host it.  Every day you don't know who it's going to be.  You know, some people want to host it, then the person who doesn't, that's really fucking funny right now.  That's brilliant.  You know, and then it isn't all like, oh, let me make this about me.  Let me, you know.  I was out for one day and said whoever wants to host it.  Nobody did.  E-Rock played bits.  That's because.  Why are they closing the curtains?  What's the big reveal?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm feeling nervous now.  Ronnie, you sent me up for something.  Seven guys coming in here with machine guns. 
[03:55:00]  Is that what you're worried about?  Is this it?  Is this the fucking thing?  I light a match and all of a sudden guns go off.  Why are they shutting?  Oh, because that's how you do your show.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Then something's going on.  Will you at least keep.  I try to make this show visual.  Fez doesn't like to have eye contact with.  Me, I know.  Don't be like that, Opie.  You know how he feels about it.  I'm going to try to work it out with him.  I decided.  I would ask you a question, but I don't want to.  Just by even saying that, though.  Well, no, I'm not trying to ask. 
[03:55:30]  No, see what that is?  You're picking up on it?  Yeah, because now we have to go.  What would the question be that you didn't want to ask?  We understand you don't want to ask it, but now we have to know.  I would have just said, what do you mean by that, Opie?  And you could have furthered your explanation.  Why not just let it sit?  Let it fucking simmer a little bit.  Let people that are listening to the show go, oh, God.  Can you go back to that picture?  That's interesting.  Which picture?  You don't even know what was just up there?  It was in Naked Brooke Shields, and the little girl thing is usually not my thing, but how  old was she?  E-Rock put it up there.  He's doing it right now.  Oh.  E-Rock actually has this on his own stuff. 
[03:56:00]  Is that wrong to think that's not Ronnie?  No, that's 1980.  That's when she did the, we're all trapped on an island, like lost.  Oh, that's Blue Lagoon?  Yeah, Blue Lagoon.  How old was she in Blue Lagoon?  Um, this was probably her last Naked role, so she must have been like 11, 12, 13.  That's it, right?  Yeah.  Well, she was always tall for her age.  Yeah, she was.  She was a blanket.  Her eyes are ridiculous.  I think this was the time when she was dating Michael Jackson.  She was 15 in Blue Lagoon.  Okay.  And she's 46 now.  Yeah, we figured mid-40s, although she doesn't look mid-40s, but we just figured it out because 
[03:56:30]  we've known her forever.  Did you see her, how bad she fucked up on the Tony Awards?  She explained it on our show.  Yeah.  She's like, fuck, I fucked it up so bad.  I was so bummed out.  She said she called her husband, I don't know how to get out of this, because she knew  she was going back up on the stage.  Her husband goes, go up there and curse.  And she's like, what?  And he goes, yeah, if you curse, that's what they're going to pick up on, and they're going  to forget that you just fumbled and mumbled through that thing.  So make it worse all the time.  So now they're talking about how she cursed on the Tonys. 
[03:57:00]  It's pretty smart.  It's actually, who's her husband?  I don't even know.  She used to be with her husband.  I don't know what he does now, but he's a joke writer, or was.  Like, he used to sell jokes to Jim Carrey for 50 bucks, and Chris, I don't know if officially  Chris Rock, but a bunch of guys.  I hate to think of those guys buying gags, though, don't you?  Yeah, I hate it, too.  Yeah.  I hate it, too.  Just if you've got nothing to say, don't go up that night.  What's the big fucking deal?  You are right, man.  When you find out that a lot of these major, over-the-top comics actually had jokes written 
[03:57:30]  for them, I'm like, wow, why?  Who's some of the biggest that you know that have writers?  Well, I mean, when Chris Rock does an award show, he hires Rich Voss.  Well, I kind of get it for an award show, because it's such a weird thing.  Right.  But if it's just his act, and he's touring around the country, I kind of feel like you  want to think it's his.  Kind of think they just go up and do their thing.  Yeah.  Well, she said her husband wrote for Jim Carrey.  Gave him a joke here and there.  Do you know of guys?  No.  As you ask that question, I'm not... 
[03:58:00]  Because it doesn't come out in public.  No, it really doesn't.  They don't really want that out there.  It's really fucking distasteful.  So when you ask that, I'm like, fuck, I couldn't give you a list.  Yeah, it's really fucking...  Yeah, well, it's weird, because with a recording artist, they will put on there, you know, who  wrote the fucking song, and then it's out front.  Right.  But, you know, if it's Jim Carrey, he should be like, you know, here's something Brooke  Shields' husband said to me.  I think it's...  If I was writing for Jim Carrey, I'd be just like, stretch that neck out a little bit.  Just a little bit.  It's working for you.  Yeah.  It's working for you.  Make it seem like your feet are on backwards. 
[03:58:30]  Wow.  That had to be stunt boobs in Bluelive.  Yeah, that's not real.  That couldn't...  You couldn't do that.  No.  Even back then.  They're heaving boobs.  Brooke Shields' character's on her back, but you don't see her back.  Yeah, they did use stunt doubles, right?  You have to.  I have to think that.  Wow, that's a big muff underwater.  Okay.  That was a late 70s, early 80s muff.  Oh, yeah.  That's...  That was just literally...  At first, I thought it was a blowfish from here.  Okay.  No, it was fucking... 
[03:59:00]  Seriously, it was good.  All right, good.  You just didn't want to give me anything.  Thanks, Rodney.  I thought Jim Carrey, if he wants to.  I know he's doing Letterman.  I felt like I don't want to give him anything like that.  Actually, I saw Jim Carrey on TV the other night.  I thought he was fucking hysterical.  So he does Letterman, and he tells this long story about his dogs getting in with skunks  and all this kind of stuff, and he acts it out, and then Letterman says, you know, it's  weird because Tom Hanks was just on the show talking about the same thing, and they show  Tom Hanks, and it was like word for word, he had captured fucking Hanks, and Jim Carrey's 
[03:59:30]  just sitting there looking like he's busted and all fucking embarrassed.  It was very, very funny.  Was it set up?  Yeah.  It was all fucking set up.  Between those two, I mean?  Yeah.  Okay.  Good bit.  Yeah, it's very, very funny.  I can't believe no one's ever done it before.  That's pretty smart.  Just fucking go in and lift another fucking celebrity's panel.  That's really smart.  That's really smart.  Hey, before I leave, Ronnie, discussion on time travel and future shows and stuff.  I bragged yesterday that we were the first radio show that time traveled, and I got killed  on my Twitter. 
[04:00:00]  They said, well, Ronnie B's been time traveling for the last four weeks.  My answer to that was that you just pre-recorded.  No, no, no, no.  What's the difference between time travel radio, which I believe me and Ann and Jimmy did yesterday,  and what you did the last four weeks?  I think it's fucking amazing that you guys did it second.  I think that takes a lot of time.  Seriously, it takes an amazing amount of courage.  You guys have always been good that way, like seeing when something's breaking and being  right there, right in the fucking pocket.  So you don't want to admit you just were pre-recording that that was some time traveling shit you were  doing before we did it. 
[04:00:30]  Well, see, we were doing the news before it fucking happened, calling games before it  happened.  I don't know.  The stuff that you were doing, you were interacting with tape, right?  The online feed.  Oh, the online feed.  It was looping.  There was some Inception shit going on, because then it was like three or four of our voices  at the same time, as we were still live.  By the way, have you gone back and watched Inception?  No.  The great thing about it is it gets worse and worse every time that you watch it.  Really? 
[04:01:00]  It's like the opposite of Goodfellas.  Goodfellas gets better and better, obviously.  I've never seen Inception.  Really?  I loved it in theaters, but I guess...  Here's the thing.  Inception's so great.  You would fucking love it.  There's this ring.  It's got magical powers, and it represents everything that dragons have done throughout  the...  It's like a dragon king.  Oh, nice.  Who's running...  And these dwarves.  Yeah.  They're like friendly, but somehow they're...  Yeah, they're Inception.  But somehow they're like mischievous. 
[04:01:30]  It's a weird thing, because one of them's riding a unicorn.  So fucking good.  And DiCaprio, which character does he play in this whole thing?  DiCaprio plays a boy who drowns on the Titanic, and it's such a...  It's a weird movie.  A lot of stuff is going on.  Well, it's everything you like.  It's fighting robots.  It's got everything.  So there's a fucking Green Lantern.  You know, we brought it up on our show, but Titanic was just a movie about a one-night  stand.  Where was the love in that movie?  Where was the love in that movie?  Love at first sight.  Fuck no. 
[04:02:00]  That was a one-night stand.  You don't think it would have survived the test of time?  No.  They fucking were on a big ship trying to get to America.  They're in the middle of the ocean, and it's a one-night stand movie.  Well, here's the thing to actually back up, and I hadn't really thought about this  before.  But it's really, when you're a rich girl, it's really easy to fuck the townie.  You know, like, hey, she's edgy.  But then to move across town?  Yeah.  You know, fucking...  Nah, that's a whole different thing.  Yeah, they'd actually have to leave her lifestyle and not just leave it while she's on vacation. 
[04:02:30]  Right.  Let's have her grow up in Long Island and see how fucking great it is.  And no one else would let go of the fucking piece of wood there in the ocean.  And just hang out?  You'd push her off at that point.  I think there was enough fucking room.  I think so, too.  Yeah, if they were both sitting on it instead of lying down.  Well, look, you're going to sit on it.  The lower half of your body might get a little colder because a little more of it's going  to be in the water.  Put your fucking feet up.  Yeah.  You should have mounted her and got on that big ass of hers and just fucking...  That's a great idea.  You know, just fucking relax.  I think we've got to kill about 15 minutes before a boat shows up here. 
[04:03:00]  It's so weird.  They hired an iceberg to play that part.  Oh, I'll be...  Well, her lower half's a little big.  I know.  I know.  I like what icebergs are if you see what's going on under the water.  I know, but I just meant it was hurtful.  Why is it hurtful?  She's a multi-millionaire.  It doesn't mean she would like to be made fun of.  Wish one of the other guys was hosting right now.  Well, they're welcome to.  Mars could come in and host for a while.  Mars would be fucking great.  You would like to see that?  Yeah.  Could you do a week of this, Sam? 
[04:03:30]  What?  Rotating host?  Take Ronnie's idea.  You have nothing to do with it except spin the fucking wheel.  Yeah.  And then you could be like...  Spin the wheel, make the deal.  Of course.  And then you could be like kind of on the side there, kind of watching the whole thing.  Well, I don't want people...  Do it for a week.  I don't want people...  I won't be on the side because then people will think I'm trying to make it about me.  Walk around and get a short list of people that could do it.  Okay.  Certainly our staff, but maybe Sterniola.  Maybe a couple of the Ron and Fez guys.  I don't know.  Whatever.  My interns are unbelievable.  Yeah.  Are they?  And then you spin the fucking wheel and they get that hour. 
[04:04:00]  And you kind of control it a little bit to make sure it's not totally off the rails.  What about hosts from other fucking places?  There's so many of these other stations that are trying to get people to listen.  Here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Sterniola.  What about the morning mashup?  What if we just got them all in here?  That would be boring.  You wouldn't like that?  You don't like the morning mashup, guys?  Not really.  Hmm?  They play hits.  Yeah.  I have no respect for people that play hits.  Why are they playing hits?  Since they're on satellite.  Do we really need hits here?  No, we don't need hits. 
[04:04:30]  We should be making hits.  And how easy is that gig?  Six people to play hits?  They say that it's four of them.  And they say that their chemistry is what makes them really special.  They play hits.  They're like the Beatles that way, though.  Yeah.  The one thing they've got to do every day is make believe they really want to play Kesha  again.  That's their whole job.  Yeah.  I mean, there's only 25 songs or so.  So they have to get up and get excited.  It's top 25.  It ain't even top 40.  It's top 25 now.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not.  Yeah.  It's not a lot of different songs. 
[04:05:00]  What do they do?  They talk.  They come up with like four or five different topics per day that might, you know, turn into  a, uh, here's what happened in my life.  Let's make it a hypothetical question.  Next break, we take calls and then we move on to the next topic.  That's the formula.  So give us one of the topics.  So I understand.  Like, uh, we could play along.  They would say, they would say, Oh, Nicole will come on and say, I told Matt to do, to  take out the garbage.  And he was mad at me because an hour later I took it out myself instead of waiting for 
[04:05:30]  him to do it.  But I didn't think it was ever going to get done.  And how long should you let your significant other?  That's a really boring relationship.  Well, I don't know.  I can't comment on the relationship.  Who cares?  Why would it be a thing in a household?  Well, you have to kind of twist it into topic to get the phones lit up, you know?  Yeah.  People got 35 minutes.  Ron, is that a thing in your household?  The garbage?  No.  Yeah.  It's either.  You only need two phone calls because these breaks are two and a half minutes.  Every once in a while I'll hear, Oh, you said you're going to take out the garbage.  Oh yeah, I forgot. 
[04:06:00]  Oh yeah, I'll do it now.  And that's it.  You wouldn't be a caller that related to that topic.  No.  They would have to focus on the other people.  See, my side of that thing is, what the fuck did you just say to me?  Seriously, I want you to fucking say it again.  What the fuck did you just say about the garbage?  See, that's Philly coming out now.  Yeah.  Ronnie tries to keep the Philly down in him.  I listen enough to know that Ronnie is struggling every day with the Philly thing inside his body.  He really struggles.  He struggles with it.  That's the real Ronnie right there. 
[04:06:30]  I hope he fucking gets it because for fucking people who don't have a lot, they have too  much pride.  It's the one thing they have too much on.  Yeah.  They constantly think they're disrespected.  Right.  For fucking apparent reason.  That's Philly.  He's this guy Philly.  Can we get Rob Cross on the wheel?  Yeah, fine.  Can we get him hosting an hour?  Ronnie, I mean...  Rob Cross is a very fucking skilled program director.  And he used to be on the radio in Arizona, and I forget what his name was.  It was...  Chuck Roast.  Okay, Chuck.  I almost called him Meatloaf, and I knew that couldn't have been right.  His name was Chuck Roast? 
[04:07:00]  Chuck Roast.  Oof.  Kid Kelly knew him back then, so he had to be somebody.  He didn't know him well enough to bring him up with him.  Well, he wasn't going to hire him.  By the way, is Kid Kelly the correct Kid Kelly that we hired?  Because there's so many around the country.  No, no, no.  He's the Kid Kelly.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  He's the guy.  What were some of those other names, Ronnie?  Mason Dixon.  Mason Dixon was a biggie.  It's all over.  I got one.  Sandy Beach.  There were a few Sandy Beaches.  Okay.  I'll give you another one.  The guy who does the morning show over at Raw Dog. 
[04:07:30]  Sonny.  Sonny Fox.  Sonny Fox.  There's a lot of Sonny Foxes.  Is there?  I didn't know that.  And Sonny Fox got...  Given the name Sonny Fox, the Sonny Fox that we know, not knowing that there was a more  established Sonny Fox.  Oh, no kidding.  Like at one time, program directors would just tell you, hey, I'm putting you on the air as this.  And the kid would be like, great.  I don't give a fuck.  Where are we at with Spider Harrison?  Is there just one spider?  Spider Harrison.  No, I'm serious.  Can we get a countdown?  No, I think there might be more than one.  He's Spider with a Y. 
[04:08:00]  He's Spider with a Y.  Oh, Spider with a Y.  Oh, that's why he's not getting sued?  That's original.  Well, he's been Spider Harrison for a long time, too.  And I would have...  I think Bubba...  Well, there's been Bubba somethings, but I think even they tried another Bubba Love Sponge.  And I think maybe the...  I think Scott tried to rip it off.  Who?  Scott and Todd.  Scott Shannon, yeah.  Scott...  Wasn't there like a fake Bubba on there?  Scott Shannon did fake Bubba when he took Pirate Radio to L.A.  Yeah, he did fake...  He started saying he was Bubba Love Sponge.  He did it when he was at Z100 in New York, too. 
[04:08:30]  They used to have their guy go out and do...  Look for bumper stickers to give you $100 if you were listening to the radio at that time.  And that guy was always named Bubba the Love Sponge.  That's really fucked up to just feel like you can steal somebody's gimmick.  Yeah, no kidding.  Is there only one human, Newman?  Yes, there is.  Everyone knows that.  I hope so.  Well...  You picked the one name that we all know there's only one.  We don't know that.  That's why I asked the question.  We're positive.  Well, I'm glad you answered that.  I can't wait for tomorrow's show.  Yeah, who's going to be spinning the wheel? 
[04:09:00]  I like the idea of Mars fucking in here.  Are we starting on a Friday?  Yes.  You going to do it next week?  I'll do it next week.  It's Ronnie's idea.  So today and tomorrow, you've got to figure out who's going to be in the pool.  We've got to build a wheel.  You've got to build a wheel.  Build a wheel.  We don't do sound effects.  This has to be a real wheel, not a fake production wheel.  The clicks?  Does it have to click?  Yeah, where you're acting like, oh, we're doing it, and then you pull it out of your pocket.  Yeah, we don't like that type of radio.  Fucking been around the radio enough for a shit.  Like a wheel of meat.  Kenny, do you want in?  No. 
[04:09:30]  Okay, Kenny's out.  You're going to be perfect.  Seriously, Kenny, I would love to fucking hear it.  Cop talk.  I would love to, but I don't work for free.  Okay.  Well, that's part of the deal.  Mars, you don't mind?  I'm in.  Okay.  All right, good.  What if we open it up to the listeners?  Everyone who has a podcast, which is every listener now.  Everybody.  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  We're competing with listeners now for audience.  And every comic.  The fuck, you assholes.  Every comic that you've ever had on your show has their own podcast.  Talking to the other comics who have podcasts.  Well, I laugh at the comics because they kind of look down at radio guys. 
[04:10:00]  Look what you're doing now.  Are you in, Eric?  Look what you're doing now.  Are you in or are you going to say to the producer?  I got to sit here and do everything else so I can't.  Once again.  Holy shit.  Once again, Eric has an excuse for not stepping up.  Oh, wow.  And taking the spotlight.  Iraq, you could also play some of the tunes you love.  What was that first album you ever bought yesterday?  He's the DJ, I'm the rapper.  My first prince.  That was funny.  I heard that yesterday, too.  Well, then we got to find out who else is interested.  I'm sure Troy will do it, but I don't know if you want Troy.  Death metal. 
[04:10:30]  I'm a big fan of Troy.  Okay, you want Troy on.  Big fan.  He's on the list, then.  He's moved up.  So far, we got Troy Mars and Rob Cross.  You know what?  We should seriously, fucking every time we talk about this, we should start saying your  kisses on my list.  I was making the list up.  That'd be the fucking go-to song.  And Sterniolo's there, too.  Yeah.  What about Dusty Street?  Does she get a part of this?  Who?  Exactly.  I don't know.  I think we're...  You don't know who came before you.  That's a shame.  He doesn't fucking...  He doesn't know the business.  Yeah, you don't care. 
[04:11:00]  I don't know.  The sweat we put into this business, she should know us.  I'm trying to learn from you.  Okay.  Learn about Dusty Street and come back with a full report tomorrow.  I just got a text that Fez climbed a flagpole downstairs, so I got to go get him down  off there.  Fez is here?  Yeah.  Wow.  Trying to make the scene today.  That's great.  Looks like he's not coming in, though.  He's up on a flagpole.  Oh.  Out in front of the fucking 30-year-old.  Jesus.  I don't know what it means, so I got to go get him.  Hope it was a great scene, yeah.  Yeah.  How was the jury thing? 
[04:11:30]  It was horrible.  Did you really learn from that?  Yeah.  I have to come on your show.  I want to talk about it.  Are you a changed man?  In what way?  I don't know.  You saw some shit, right?  Yeah, I saw some ugly shit, but I don't know if it changed.  Don't give me any.  Grand jury stuff is rough, no?  No.  Some of it is very, very uncomfortable to have to see.  You know, they have to see the victims and some of the stuff that happened.  The other part of it, though, is in fucking New York, never get in trouble because the  grand jury, I think 90-some percent of them are like, fuck that guy, whoever it is. 
[04:12:00]  They're just like, hey, if the cops said it, fuck him.  So you could get in fucking serious trouble in this town.  Really?  Serious fucking trouble.  You saw the system at work.  Yeah.  Don't punch another fucking guy.  Don't punch anyone.  Because I saw people in bar fights and serious fucking shit.  You've talked in front of grand jurors before, right?  Any grand jury, you can indict a ham sandwich.  Yeah, that's the old fucking saying.  And they would say you could indict a ham sandwich unless Ronnie B's on the fucking 
[04:12:30]  grand jury.  Right.  Because, and I'm going to wait like a month or two and bring in some of the guys from  the grand jury.  But we were.  Did you make friends?  Yeah.  Well, I have made better friends than I do at work.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  Mainly, it felt like you were in the Lost Island where people started to fucking depend on  each other.  But there are certain, like, I said this before, too, like, the detectives. 
[04:13:00]  There's some really fucking bright New York detectives.  Some of the uniformed cops, I don't know.  That's the fucking roll of the dice.  Some of them, some of them you're like, all right, this guy.  But other guys, you're like, he's like a bouncer in a bar.  He's, you know, I don't know if I fucking trust anything.  This guy is saying.  And the DAs, they're fucking frightening.  They are fucking frightening.  So you don't want to trust the judicial system?  No, no, no, no.  No, not at all.  I want to fucking stay away from anything that happens. 
[04:13:30]  Everybody should have a fucking lawyer.  I've come to figure out.  Everyone should have a defense lawyer.  Rich people do better than poor people?  White people are the best fucking people.  The number of people indicted with Hispanic last names in the island of Manhattan was alarming.  Overwhelming?  Alarming.  Really?  Do they have lawyers, though?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Because there are.  This is real shit, too, man. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  But also, to me, some of the best people that I think I've ever had the chance to fucking see  are the detectives who work in the sex crime fucking part of it.  Right.  Those guys are the shit.  They're the fucking dudes.  And when you see some ugly stuff and then these guys come in and basically tell you, not only  did we, we got him to sign.  Don't worry about it.  And they get so many fucking people to sit down and sign.  Wow.  And you're like, why would the guy do it?  There's nothing in it for him. 
[04:14:30]  You can only imagine, you know, the pressure that guy was feeling to sign.  I don't know whether they just fucking tore him around, what they do.  I would love to know the secrets.  But when those guys were coming in, the fucking deal was already done.  Don't worry about it.  We got this.  This is all ready.  We're making him build his own fucking jail.  There's like, yeah, there is fucking spooky stuff.  But yeah, you don't want to be poor in this country for any fucking reason.  And everyone knows that.  Yeah.  Why don't they change that? 
[04:15:00]  In what way?  How would you change it?  I don't know.  It just seems, quote, unfair in a country where we feel like we give everyone a shot.  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, everyone does have the same thing.  Everyone gets an attorney.  But then when you have more money, you get the good attorney.  You get the better attorney.  Right.  It's kind of like a video game.  You get the better video weapons, excuse me, if you got, you know, points and money.  It's exactly right.  So that guy's coming in and going, well, wait a minute.  How does this blood thing work?  And you're going in. 
[04:15:30]  A regular fucking guy doesn't have that kind of money to figure out, hey, what did they do in the lab?  They're just like, that lab shit is fucking cement.  You know, he's like, hey, the lab said it.  I'm like, I don't know, I guess.  Why would the lab lie?  You know?  So you really do need OJ money to fucking relax in this country.  That's unbelievable.  I hate to break up this conversation, but we're running into Ron and Fez time.  Who are you?  Seriously.  My name's Sam.  You were the guy that used to fucking host the show before Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal took place. 
[04:16:00]  Next week is Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal.  I also want to do that same thing for the people that are co-hosting or basically the sidekick for Dave on the Saturday Night Dave show that everybody loves.  That's up to Dave.  That would be completely up to Dave.  Does Dave get a shot at this hour?  He's doing his morning news thing, so he's pretty far away.  Yeah, I'm glad he's finally doing what he loves. 
[04:16:30]  I'm so glad he finally found his calling.  News, radio.  He's good at it.  Have you ever heard any of the things that he's done?  No, no.  You've got to play one during your show.  It sounds like a man who's got a gun at his head.  He's a co-host now, though, on the show.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I thought he was just doing news.  No, he's officially the show co-host.  Well, when can we push that girl out?  She's fucking...  I mean, I'm sure he's working on it,  and I would hope that the station recognizes that  she's yesterday's news at this point. 
[04:17:00]  Do they do garbage bits about not taking the garbage out?  No, no, no.  They don't go into mash-up territory.  So it's very slow...  It's an NPR station?  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah.  So he has to monotone it?  Yeah.  And just be like,  interesting thing I saw in the news.  Dave does try to tell a funny story every now and then,  but for us who are used to hearing Dave's real funny stories,  you could just tell how completely subdued...  subdued...  Like, he seems like he's on a tranquilizer of some sort.  Like, he just...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He slightly laughs instead of doing that, you know, 
[04:17:30]  real big laughing...  Real funny, taking his dick out and slapping it on the table.  And it's not that crazy of a story at all...  Right.  ...compared to what we know he has.  Does he stick anything up his ass?  He's never done that on this show yet.  Wow.  I saw Dave the other day.  He was all...  On a bridge?  No.  We were at a wake...  As you were driving by.  We were at a wake, and everyone's sitting around.  It was like, kind of a quiet time.  And Dave, and this is a fucking total shoot.  He was being serious.  He wasn't being strange.  And he just goes... 
[04:18:00]  He wasn't trying to be funny.  He goes,  You know, formaldehyde has only been with us since the 1860s.  And interestingly enough, it came along same time as the Civil War.  So it really was like the dot-com business of its day.  And we're all like,  What the fuck are you talking about?  But I bet most people weren't aware of that.  He'd just seen some Civil War documentary  and just had this thing in his head as,  I'm going to try to appear as smart as you can when possible.  Can we rescue him somehow? 
[04:18:30]  Or is it too late at this point?  No.  Dave is going to break through, in my fucking opinion.  Dave is going to hit something.  And I do think it's going to be visual.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  His videos are terrific.  His videos are so fucking funny.  But the thing that I told him years ago,  instead of fucking having an anchor like Sam around his neck,  is I really wanted him and his chick to do the show together.  Right.  And do that kind of he-said-she-said fucking show back and forth.  Because it's always been a very, very funny concept to me. 
[04:19:00]  Sam missed, a couple weeks ago,  Sam misses a lot of time on that weekend show.  And they did the show together,  and people were going fucking crazy for it.  Yeah, they enjoyed it.  Because it was the first special delivery  that they really felt like Dave came through almost himself.  But I also get positive feedback when it's me and Dave,  and when it's just me.  People love the show.  From your parents.  I know that.  And your parents are great people.  Well, they like it, and so do a lot of fans.  Are your parents, you think right now,  they're going,  you really think they're going to do this spin the wheel,  make the deal thing? 
[04:19:30]  Well, they won't.  It doesn't seem right.  They won't be listening except for the part when I spin the wheel,  if that goes down.  But you are confident that everyone else is going to bore of it,  and you slide right back in, right?  Everybody, I mean, if they're better than me,  they can take it.  I mean, I'm not, I think.  You're that sure that you're so much better  than all the people you work with?  I don't know of any,  if they are better than me,  they can take it.  I'm not,  like if it is what it is,  then it is what it is.  I'm not confident or unconfident.  How many times did you say is in that fucking sentence? 
[04:20:00]  It's like seven fucking times.  Yeah, four or five.  Have you learned anything from this hour, Sam?  Yeah, I shouldn't ask questions.  It was passive-aggressive, wasn't it?  I mean, I hope he fucking brings you in here,  gives you the fucking shot,  and then you slap that on him.  It's fucking odd, that's all.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  Well, I was being attacked a little bit.  Were you going for edgy there?  No.  I'd never go for edgy.  I'm not the least edgy person on the channel. 
[04:20:30]  He told Morris to fuck himself, basically.  No, he said shut the fuck up.  Knowing that he can't choke you out.  Yeah.  That's edgy.  Is it?  Yes.  Seems kind of wimpy.  Why is it wimpy?  Because only a wimp would say this  knowing that he can't get choked out  when everybody listening knows  that if I had the possibility of getting choked out,  I wouldn't be saying it.  That's a smart answer.  I don't know.  Well, I think you're fucking wiry,  and I think you'd have a tough time catching you.  I'm not even sure if you can.  I don't know if you can.  Seriously, I've seen you move. 
[04:21:00]  You're very fucking quick.  I guess so.  But, I mean, Mars has training.  I'm sure if it came down to fisticuffs,  Mars would do all right.  Well, Mars is a little slow these days.  You think so?  Yeah, he's a little soft.  But do you notice something?  He's a little uncomfortable.  I like this.  Well, I'm not uncomfortable,  but the vibe has changed.  Yes, it has.  Yeah.  What, between the two of you?  Between me and Mars, exactly.  Who are you talking about?  You right now.  Yeah, I think Sam took it too far with Mars today.  No, no.  You think that's what did it?  With Ron.  Ron putting him in his place. 
[04:21:30]  No, no.  The only time I got mad  is when he slapped fucking Opie back with that.  What am I supposed to do?  I feel it.  And I'm like, hey, easy.  Yeah.  But if there's anything that happens  between you two guys,  I think it should be the old Indian leg wrestling,  which hasn't been done for many, many years.  I think it's hard to bring that back.  Don't bring Ron into this for no reason.  What the fuck is the Indian leg wrestling?  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  You should go do radio.  It's something.  Yeah.  Talk about garbage.  Maybe they should do it and take it out.  Yeah, yeah.  You're more the,  should I take the garbage out or not type of thing.  Right.  He's all like, 
[04:22:00]  oh, let's go Mexico Gold Cup this Saturday night.  Easy.  With us for once.  USA.  Stop wearing the Sirius XM shirt around like.  Like that's going to help get you a raise.  It is what it is.  He's really flying the colors.  Yeah.  All right, that's it.  Yeah, why are you flying the colors?  Why am I flying the Sirius XM colors?  I know.  I mean.  Because it's a free shirt.  Yes, exactly.  What's wrong with it?  It's always the same thing.  I got to go get Fez.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Oh, yeah.  The flagpole thing.  Thanks, Ronnie.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  I'll be an Anthony. 
[04:22:30]  I enjoy the hour with you.  Continue tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
