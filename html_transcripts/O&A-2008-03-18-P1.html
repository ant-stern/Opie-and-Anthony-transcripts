<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a joke about a PGA golfer accused of killing a hawk, before diving into a detailed discussion of a VH1 reality show.  This segment heavily featured clips and commentary on a contestant named Tiffany, described as unattractive and repeatedly ejected from the show for erratic, intoxicated, and racially offensive behavior.  The hosts also discussed other contestants' outrageous actions, specifically highlighting a phone sex challenge involving Bret Michaels and subsequent fights between the female contestants.

The show then transitioned to a humorous bit on using a rotary phone, contrasting it with modern technology. This segued into a broader discussion on the absurdity of celebrity reality TV, featuring mentions of various has-been celebrities and brainstorming ludicrous future show concepts.  A clip of Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) engaging in inappropriate behavior was shown and discussed.  The conversation then shifted to a chimney burglar who got stuck and needed police rescue, leading to jokes about the burglar and a discussion about birds, their perceived stupidity, and a caller who owned several birds, including a talking parrot. Patrice O'Neal called in to critique the Star Wars saga in high definition, specifically targeting the Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks. Colin Quinn also called in with a humorous anecdote about a child at a baseball game, sparking a discussion about kids in sports and, ultimately, a lengthy conversation on high school gym teachers and locker room experiences.

The hosts then reminisced about their own high school experiences, focusing on their adolescent fascination with seeing girls naked in the locker room and sharing anecdotes about classmates trying to sneak into the girls' locker room.  They also talked about a gym with a strategically placed mirror offering a view into the women's locker room.  This led to a phone interview with Ruth Buzzi, which quickly devolved into a series of increasingly awkward and offensive questions from Opie and Anthony, leaving Buzzi visibly uncomfortable and ending the call prematurely.  Big Kev's presence at a celebrity event and his role in facilitating the call with Buzzi and other planned guests was mentioned.

Following the Buzzi interview, a listener's question prompted a discussion about condoms. Anthony shared a personal anecdote about a condom mishap in his youth, leading to a conversation about his aversion to having children and speculating on the reasons behind it. The show then featured the "Wake Up Your Spouse" segment, where Steve from Orange County called in and woke his wife with a blowtorch.  Another listener's participation in the segment was briefly discussed.  The segment concluded with Anthony describing his move to a predominantly Jewish neighborhood and sharing anecdotes about his limited interactions with his neighbors.

The final segment began with Anthony recounting a nighttime incident where a creaking door sound led him to believe he had an intruder. He grabbed his shotgun, searched his house in his pajamas, only to discover the sound was his girlfriend's computer email notification.  Anthony's actions were discussed with a caller, Craig, who joked about Anthony's perceived craziness.  The conversation continued on Anthonyâ€™s home security anxieties and included a humorous anecdote about a neighborly encounter with a young boy.  Unexpectedly, Bret Michaels called in to discuss his experience playing Microsoft Flight Simulator X, detailing a lengthy simulated flight and the game's realism.  The hosts and callers then discussed the game's features and the appeal of flight simulation. The segment concluded with further discussion of Anthony's perceived paranoia and his home security measures.

[00:06:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Tell those five girls, basically, you're too ugly to even get into the house on a horrific  reality show.  Oh, that's great.  That was awesome.  Did they talk to me?  I'm very disappointed.  Well, there was one girl.  Well, there was one girl who just, like, all of them, yeah, they're all just like, I'm embarrassed. 
[00:07:00]  I came all the way from Iowa.  Like, they're just, like, from horrific states, right?  The bus, like, the bus from Oklahoma City, the bus, the bus from Oklahoma City was 72 hours just  to get to Utah.  I deserved more, right?  But one girl just refused to leave.  Wow.  Yeah.  She was just the whore that wouldn't quit, right?  So she comes back, you know, and just starts pounding on the door.  And then they just had to let her in. 
[00:07:30]  And, I mean, she looked like she was every bit of 47.  Oh, my God.  Is that Tiffany?  That was the girl who kept going, don't threaten me with a good time.  Oh, Tiffany.  We got that clip, actually.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  That was her catchphrase.  They did a montage last night.  I don't know if it was on last night.  I have it on DVR or whatever.  But the episode I saw, they did a montage of her saying that over and over again.  And when she says it is basically when someone's telling her to get her life together,  someone's criticizing her.  Someone's trying to give her some real good advice, and that's what she says. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  If you don't shape up, we're kicking you out of the house.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  If you don't get off drugs, we're taking away your children.  Yeah.  That's how any of the guys have.  She was a mess.  It's the catchphrase of the summer, though.  Oh, it's fantastic.  We got the clip of Tiffany trying to get back in the house after she was deemed too ugly  to be in the house, right?  Basically.  Big Don, he called out five names.  He told us, you're out of here.  By the way, Bill, thanks for the huge setup.  No problem.  Wow, really?  We just happened to have this clip. 
[00:08:30]  Five names.  He told us, you're out of here.  I didn't come all the way from Chicago to be eliminated before I even walked in the door.  My name is Tiffany.  Hi, Tiffany.  You caught me, and I was wondering why.  Listen, it's nothing personal.  This is physical.  If it was up to Brett, he wouldn't have dismissed me.  No, Brett, if it was up to Brett, the entire city of L.A. would be here.  But I'm a big fan of his.  I had a hat made.  I came here all the way from Chicago.  There's literally nowhere for you to sleep.  I'll sleep on the floor.  Please. 
[00:09:00]  Please, I'm begging you.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I don't care.  If I had a hat made, I'll do anything.  Anything.  I'm using bags.  He finally said, yeah, and I jumped up, hugged him, and I didn't let go.  It's meant to be.  Oh, man.  What did she have made?  A hat?  Yeah.  I can't hear.  A hat made.  Tara Reid's older sister.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  I'll do anything.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  You have to stop smoking crystal meth first.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  I'll tell you, man, if she did four more episodes, she could have sold a million of those  t-shirts.  It was just, it really was going to, like you said, it was going to be the catchphrase  of the summer.  Oh, my God.  Well, then she gets let back in the house, and this is what she does immediately.  I'm Tiffany.  I'm an alcoholic. 
[00:10:00]  Tiffany, she got completely bombed.  I was just sitting back watching, like, holy ****.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, ****.  Ain't no booty like Southside Booty.  Ain't there's no band enough to step front of my face.  I got here this long.  I'm not going to, like, go home now.  Brett will keep me around.  Just an old, drunk broad.  Is that what she is?  This is what it's not doing justice.  She's like one of those girls who's old, but she's kept herself in shape.  Right.  So from the neck down, she could be 32, but you look at her face. 
[00:10:30]  She's just a, she's a lizard.  She's closer to 50.  Oh, it's awful.  Oh, Jesus.  Tammy Faye.  Yesterday.  You know what?  It's a good show.  I mean, yesterday I was watching.  They had to do phone sex because if Bret Michaels is on the road.  Did you see that episode yet?  Oh, it was great.  I'm telling you, it's a great show.  You know, Bret's girl's got to, like, you know, help him out if he's on the road and  she's back home.  Oh, sure.  So they had all these girls, like, dressing their hottest, like, lingerie and lay on this, 
[00:11:00]  like, you know, this, like, heart-shaped type bed and do phone sex and he's in another  room.  And they hooked up something.  Did they hook it up to his?  Yeah, they actually hooked something up to his unit.  Yeah.  To see if he would get aroused.  Yeah.  And if he were terrible at it, they would just flatline.  The best part was Bret would get halfway through if they stunk.  He just hung up on them.  Dude, I'm telling you.  And they got some great bits on this show.  One girl just started just giving phone sex and everyone else was, like, horrified, like, 
[00:11:30]  whoa, man, it's just a fun little show we're trying to participate in.  And she's like, oh, suck your beep.  Her whole segment was beeped out.  That was the weird thing.  Wow, heck, you're a beep in my beep.  All the other girls are watching.  So it kind of made it awkward.  But there were some girls that were just so bad at it.  They were just like, I just really want to spend time with you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just, you know, I just think you're interesting. 
[00:12:00]  And it's just like, lady, what is this supposed to do for this guy?  This guy's a rock star.  He's probably had an 18 on one.  18 on one.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God, Brett, let me tell you what I'll do.  I will take your entire beep into my beep and then beep and beep until you beep all over my beep.  And if you want to put it beep, feel free.  I don't mind that.  I've done it before.  Brett, if me staying in the house takes you putting it beep, I will do that. 
[00:12:30]  I've never done that sober.  But I'll probably do it for you.  And I'll even wash **** because my **** is probably really filthy.  But for you, I'll do anything.  I'll let you go from **** to my ****.  And that's really sick.  That's disgusting.  A lot of girls won't do that.  A lot of girls wouldn't let you put ****. 
[00:13:00]  But I would let you do that right there.  And I will **** until you ****.  And then if you want to put it ****, I'll even do that.  I don't care.  Do you have a dog?  If you have a dog and some peanut butter, I will **** the peanut butter on ****.  And then I'll let the dog ****.  And you can watch.  I'll even let the dog **** me.  All over my, on my. 
[00:13:30]  And the dog could, I don't even care.  Even the dog could **** my ****.  Because I don't care.  And that's really dirty.  But for you, I'll do it.  We got one more Tiffany clip worth playing.  You love me ****.  Love you ****.  She's a sloppy mess.  And it was pretty funny.  ****.  Hey, that's not a nice word. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah, it is.  It's not a nice word.  You can't go throwing words like that around.  Hey, now, now.  Simmer down now.  Simmer down now.  No, you simmer down.  Simmer down.  Yeah, that needed a set up, obviously.  Tiffany calls one of the two black girls in the house an F-ing C-word.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She was dropping it.  Dropping it like it was not that.  Why would they boot her?  Yeah, right. 
[00:14:30]  Did they boot her yet?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they boot.  Yeah, she was.  Yeah, that's where they're just so stupid.  Why?  You would like the black.  You keep her as long as you possibly can.  You know, they did it with Sanjaya.  Loose cannon.  You keep these people.  It makes it interesting.  It would have been good because the black girl on the show is hilarious.  She wore like a first.  There's a clip on CW11.  Oh, there it is.  Of a clip of the show.  Yeah, well, I think he's on CW11 right now.  And then he's heading over here.  Yeah, there he is.  It's still 1988, dude. 
[00:15:00]  I was going to say, don't talk about him, but he's on there, so he can't listen to us right now.  He looks good, though, man.  I got to say, he doesn't look much different than he did a few years ago.  Oh, wow.  I mean, they showed him in like pajamas without all that stuff.  Like the headband.  Oh, that was bad.  Oh, my God.  He looked like a circus clown out of his makeup.  Oh.  It was bad, dude.  He's had some stuff done on his face.  Well, there's chicks like pushing each other and stuff.  No, that black girl's hilarious.  The other black girl there is like, she's really into animals, like Peter. 
[00:15:30]  And the black girl had a fur coat.  And she goes, I hate animals.  She goes, they're for food and clothing.  And she goes, how can you say that?  She goes, if there was an animal in here right now, I'd slit its throat.  I swear to God, just to piss her off.  And she totally took the bait.  It was great.  And on last night's episode, two girls went at it after the phone sex thing.  And they're upstairs.  And the one girl has like, I think the girl calls them circus boobs.  Yeah.  She's got implants that are so massive.  And they're really high up, like way higher than they're supposed to be. 
[00:16:00]  And they just are.  Bizarre.  They're massive.  And she calls them circus boobs.  They are a little freakish look.  She looks like she has an ass on her chest.  So the one girl thought she was going to be cocky and started making fun of her circus boobs.  So the circus boob girl goes, oh, yeah, and just starts making fun of her face.  And it turns out the girl that has the kind of the face is a little off is because she was in a car accident.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  So, you know, she started the like the little fight.  And then circus boob goes, well, look at your awful face. 
[00:16:30]  And she's like, but that was from a car accident.  And then, like, you went too far with this.  And she started complaining to Brett saying it was, it's like a disability.  Would you make fun of somebody in a wheelchair?  Right.  But she was the one.  You know how it goes.  If you're going to fight, you're going to, you know, you're going to break out all the, all the weapons.  That's not fair.  I was in a car wreck.  Yeah.  If your face went through a windshield, you probably shouldn't start snapping on somebody. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  You shouldn't be talking about someone's circus boobs.  They just showed a motorcycle accident, a little motocross, a little crash one of those girls took, face planted.  It was pretty good.  So they just put these whores in interesting little contests and competitions.  Dude, they're all whores.  They're all trying to act like they're not whores.  But they have a stripper pole in there.  And then the second they got drunk, all of them were doing those, those you need whore abs stripper moves on the pole. 
[00:17:30]  You know, you got like your legs straight out.  It's like the only people who can do that are strippers.  Yeah.  I didn't want to like the show, but I like it.  Yeah.  VH1 knows what they're doing with this celebrity reality crap.  I was telling Jim last night at the cellar, like we were talking about, you know, how, you know, the reality TV and game shows.  There has never been a better time in Hollywood to be a has-been than it is right now.  Oh, my God.  You have a better shot at getting a TV show than I think.  Than anyone else.  Somebody brand new, yeah.  Scott Baio, I just want to punch him in the face. 
[00:18:00]  Have you seen that show?  The Two Corys.  The Two Corys.  They were in here yesterday.  The Two Corys, yeah.  But my thing is, what is the cutoff line where even like you're too old?  I think it's like 75 or four.  I would say like Tony Dow isn't getting a reality show.  He was the older brother on Leave It to Beaver.  But then when you get to that old, then you have to herd the has-beens.  You've got to put them all in a house.  In a surreal house, yeah.  Like the My Three Sons guys.  The My Three Sons sons. 
[00:18:30]  You could get one of them.  Yeah.  And he'd just sit there crying how there was no residuals.  Anyone from Gilligan's Island, do you think?  It'd have to be one of the women.  Yeah, Marianne or Ginger.  Ginger, yeah.  Yeah, they could probably do it.  Yeah.  Hey, we've got to like change gears a little bit here.  How to dial a rotary phone.  We teased this before the break.  Ah, speaking of the olden days.  Nice segue.  Well, you know.  Speaking of Juan Epstein, sometimes you've got to just jam on the brakes. 
[00:19:00]  Well, they could do that.  The Welcome Back Cotter people would definitely be.  Yeah.  Because they had Horshack in the fights.  Remember that?  Oh, and that celebrity box.  They've just been through all these and they gather up the has-beens to beat each other up.  And Horshack got beat up by Screech, right?  Yeah.  I'd love to be a has-beens agent just to hear the offers that come in.  Oh, it's got to be just hysterical.  VH1 wants you for a celebrity toe jam.  Race to the bottom of the Grand Canyon with the cast from Family Affair. 
[00:19:30]  Just these horrific shows.  It's heading that way.  They're going to get worse and worse.  It is VH1, I think, that started all that stuff, too.  They're the ones we first came up with.  Yeah, yeah.  They're brilliant, man.  Well, they came up with the concept of celebrity.  Yeah, they took the reality show thing.  The celebrities involved with the reality shows.  Making it cool.  Because when reality shows first hit, no celebrity would be caught dead to us.  It's like, oh, that's hack stuff.  Those are people that just can't make it legitimately. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  But then somehow VH1 talked them into like, oh, that's good.  Well, they don't get the big celebrities.  They get the has-beens, which is hysterical.  Watching these people living together.  Yeah, but see where it's going, though?  It's going to be legitimate stars are going to sign on for this as their next project.  You watch.  That mini-me guy, he was the quickest has-been ever.  He was just like the, you know.  Yeah.  They're still in post-production. 
[00:20:30]  And he was naked on that little scooter, peeing in the corner.  One of the greatest moments ever, by the way.  And he was huge.  Like when the movies came out, the Austin Powers movies, people were quoting things from the movie.  I remember page six, he was in scores and he had little leather pants.  Yeah.  And he was the toast of the town from Monday to Wednesday.  And then he's-  There he is. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my God.  How do you make a comeback from that?  How can you classify that as a person?  No.  What about when he started getting going on?  Do we have that clip?  Do we have all the clips?  Yeah.  If you're laying there dreaming about a fire, you think there's a fire engine going on? 
[00:21:30]  What a mess.  And he was.  He was, you know, a big star.  Even when he's sleeping, he doesn't even look peaceful.  No.  Completely naked on a scooter, gets off and just takes a leak in a closet.  And then he was in all the Austin Powers movies.  That's great.  So I had a dial a rotary phone.  Ah, right.  Well, everyone around here has got their iPhone.  Some people love them.  Some people hate them.  I am a fan of the iPhone.  We've come a long way, though.  We certainly have.  There's the seg. 
[00:22:00]  So you got the iPhone.  Mm-hmm.  A mere 50 years ago, they had to teach people how to use a rotary phone.  Rotary phone.  Because, you know, back in the day, you picked up the phone, you talked to the operator.  Right.  And then they did away with that, and now you can dial your own numbers.  You have to crank that little crank on the side.  Operator.  And then go, Sarah?  Yeah.  Sarah, could you connect me to 555?  Right.  Well, here's the, uh, here's, uh.  Murray Hill 6.  Yeah.  Wisconsin 9 or 8.  Here they instruct you on how to use your rotary phone. 
[00:22:30]  The local news of the week.  At midnight Saturday, the telephones in this city will be changed to dial service, and all  telephone numbers will be changed.  Ah.  Late this week, new directories will be delivered.  This is important.  Here are a few important suggestions for the use of your dial telephone.  Before calling any number, first secure the number from your new directory.  Then remove the receiver and listen for the dial tone.  It sounds like this.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Doesn't everything just sound harrowing? 
[00:23:00]  Like, like the Russians are going to attack at any moment?  Oh, my goodness.  And why can't we, like, update that?  Why are we still using the, meh?  We still got it.  It's a little different variation, but it's there.  But can't it be something else by this point?  I didn't understand even what he was saying.  Secure the number?  Secure the number.  Does that mean look it up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  First, secure the number.  Memorize it, or stay away from the apparatus.  You do not have the brain intellect to use this new technology.  It's got the voice down.  That's it. 
[00:23:30]  It sounds like this.  If you hear it, run.  That's right.  Your phone's about to explode.  The Reds have gotten your phone.  The Reds.  The Reds are coming.  The Reds.  Do not discuss the war when you pick up this apparatus.  Yes.  Loose lips sink ship.  Oh, sorry, man.  Loose lips sink ship was my line.  Damn you, Bill Burr.  If I'd have secured the number earlier, it would have been my line. 
[00:24:00]  And listen for the dial tone.  It sounds like this.  That tone indicates everything is ready for your call.  With the receiver off the hook, dial the desired number.  For example, suppose you want to dial 2-3-6-5-0.  Dial each numeral in this manner, pulling the dial around.  That's a whole phone number back there.  That's a whole number?  No dash, no parentheses, no nothing.  If you want to dial five, it's like, what's your number? 
[00:24:30]  Five.  For example, suppose you want to dial 2-3-6-5-0.  Dial each numeral in this manner, pulling the dial around to the finger stop each time.  Be sure to allow the dial to freely return to its normal position.  Would you try to stop it with your finger?  You push it sometimes.  Oh, I remember dial phone.  Come on.  You'd go like, and then rake it back to its starting position.  Oh, that's right.  You would.  Because you'd try to dial faster.  Wow, I forgot all about the stupid dial phones. 
[00:25:00]  ...the dial to freely return to its normal position.  And this is the ringing signal.  What's the same, too?  Hello?  What's the problem?  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  Come on.  Alexander Graham Bell joke?  No?  No, that's good.  I just did it.  Yeah.  If the line is... 
[00:25:30]  Hello?  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Well, how do you walk?  You could call your local bowling alley.  Call a tobacco shop.  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Well, you best let him out.  He may suffocate.  There can't be much air in there.  In there?  ...the dial...  Hello?  Is your refrigerator running?  Well, you better catch it.  Your food will go bad.  Listen to me. 
[00:26:00]  You gotta go dirty.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get breath where I said.  It's the super across the way.  Hold on, hold on.  It's gonna pick up.  If the line is busy, you'll hear this busy signal.  It's just, everything is so terminal back then.  Yeah.  Huh? 
[00:26:30]  It really is.  Like, meh.  Ah.  But we haven't really updated that crap.  The busy signal.  If you hear this busy signal, go to your local shelter.  Where there will be food and supplies.  You may have to stay there for weeks as the radiation settles down.  Oh, wait.  It's just a busy signal.  Sorry, I thought the commies were coming.  The Reds.  The Reds.  Just when we got done with the Nazi menace, the Reds come.  And remember, if you see black people in your neighborhood, dial 911. 
[00:27:00]  Now it's back in the day.  Dial 911.  If you see a Negro.  No.  Dial 911.  911.  Just nine.  Yeah.  That's reserved for the police.  They'll be sure to be there with fire hoses and German shepherds.  It's the 50s, get it?  If you get a busy signal, try writing a letter.  Thought it was funny, then.  Thank you. 
[00:27:30]  Good time to credit, then.  Yeah, right?  It was funny.  Until Saturday midnight, please use your present directory and make your calls in the usual manner.  How was that?  Yelling out the window?  We just pick up and the operator did it all.  Operator.  Hey, uh...  Number, please.  More with us.  Opie and Anthony, next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 KROQ. 
[00:28:00]  KROQ.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sometimes on the Opie and Anthony Show, we've got to deal with real stupid listeners.  Joanne, you're a dumb broad.  No, I'm not.

Oh, I get it.  I get it.  Hey, do we know who does the headlines at the Post? 
[00:29:00]  No.  It's just another guy that hides behind his laptop.  Can we find out somebody out there listening has to know the name...  Of the douche.  Of the douche who does the headlines in the Post, the one that called you a dopey-opey  and pervy pal.  I would like to know this guy's real name.  Yeah.  His real name.  They never divulge who writes these headlines.  Why is it a secret?  You're not working for the NSA.  You're working for toilet paper with print on it.  Well, it's pretty cute today. 
[00:29:30]  A chimney burglar, a bad Santa.  A bungling burglar had to be rescued by police yesterday after he tried to squeeze down a  chimney in a West Side apartment building.  I woke up and I heard faint cries and I called the police.  Dominic Singer or Domin...  What's that name?  Dominic...  Dominic.  Dominic Singer.  Singer who lived at blah, blah, blah.  Said that when cops arrived, they broke through the brick wall of her chimney.  As soon as they took away the flu, you could see his feet sticking out.  That's fantastic. 
[00:30:00]  What an ass.  They pulled him out by his feet.  Thank goodness the boiler wasn't on.  Who's saying thank goodness the boiler wasn't on?  That would have been good.  That was the homeowner saying...  The homeowner?  I'd have been on the roof.  I swear to you.  I would have been on the roof pouring scalding coffee down the chimney.  No, no.  Here's what you do.  Why use the toilet when you have a chimney with a fellow trapped in there?  With a fellow?  Hey, hey, you're getting that on my head. 
[00:30:30]  As soon as they took away the flu, you could see his feet sticking out.  And she continued.  They pulled him out by his feet.  Thank goodness the boiler wasn't on.  So she's very happy that the burglar wasn't hurt.  He was safe.  Yeah, not hurt.  But the burglar was trying to take your things.  Yeah, he was in there trying to take your things.  And maybe if you were in there, God knows what he might have tried to do.  It was 5'1".  What could he have done?  Stolen your child's clothing?  Little Sanchez beat it.  Here's the laugh of the morning right here.  I'm 5'1". 
[00:31:00]  She's 5'1".  Oh.  I'm 5'1", and he was shorter than me.  He looked like a racehorse jockey but covered in soot.  A lawn jockey.  Wow.  Little fella.  She said the robber later identified as, name I can't pronounce, was shirtless.  But his pockets were filled with loot, including a necklace probably from a previous job.  Oh, I was going to say, I thought he got in and then was climbing out.  But, yeah, he'd been on another little jaunt that evening. 
[00:31:30]  And this witness, very confused.  This guy thinks he was Spider-Man.  Spider-Man never went down chimneys, you ass.  Why does Spider-Man?  He was no Spider-Man.  He got stuck.  And he's lucky someone heard him yelling.  That's right.  Spider-Man doesn't behave like a bad boy with no shirt and loot.  Right.  Spider-Man just puts on that outfit that hugs in all the right places.  You read about every so often when they're knocking a building down and they tear down a chimney and a skeleton comes out. 
[00:32:00]  That's one of the guys that just didn't, no one heard his cries, just sitting there, help, help.  How long?  How long do you think?  What an awful death.  How long?  You got to, you got to like dehydrate, I guess, is what gets you first.  Three, four days?  I don't know how long.  You can't last that long without water.  Yeah, maybe, maybe three days.  The chimney all cramped up, your ass itches.  Oh, and your arms, you can't get to them?  No.  Is there over your head so you can fit down? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, and you're just stuck there.  Help, help.  No one for miles.  Help, help.  Especially if you're like, your arm is pressed against your mouth so you can't yell too loud.  A little shallow breath.  And you sound real loud to yourself, but outside the chimney, right outside, all they hear is,  Oh, oh.  There's a bird on top looking down because it thinks it kind of hears something.  And then it realizes, no, let's just drop a white gunky mixture on whatever the offensive noise maker is.  So much hope is gone, you think maybe the bird can help you? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Can you go get me help, bird?  Get help, ex-dinosaur.  Birds suck.  This is how stupid they are.  When they're in the cage, if you throw like a towel over it, they think it's night.  How do you not just kill those things on principle?  Bunch of dopes.  How do they survive and morph from dinosaurs to become such dopes?  A pillowcase makes it nighttime. 
[00:33:30]  It's five.  It's four in the afternoon.  Pillow.  Oh, well, it's dark.  All right.  These should be the smartest things on the face of the earth, being around that long.  They're the last of the dinosaurs.  Last of the dinosaurs.  Right.  Been around for a while.  They can fly, for God's sake.  Ah, the rooster's crowing.  First thing in the morning, towel on.  Oh, how am I going to get up for work?  It's so late. 
[00:34:00]  Every time I see a bird, I want to grab it by the tail feathers and smash it into a wall.  Look, it's night.  Just be a bad pet owner and just keep taking the pillowcase off and on.  On and off, on and off, on and off.  Yeah.  I must be 50 years old by now.  So many days have gone by.  Chomp chomp.  Emma, are we allowed to make fun of birds?  I hope not.  Cheryl, are we allowed to make fun of birds? 
[00:34:30]  We better check with Cheryl McCarthy.  He wanted to throw it against the wall.  That's a hate speech.  I'm from the Bird Hatred Society.  You people are hating on birds.  M.I.  Shwoogie, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I just had to call out everybody for missing a really good joke by Anthony.  Oh, what did they miss?  Well, when you were talking about the guy pulled out of the chimney,  Anthony said he looked like a little jockey except covered with soot.  And Anthony said like a lawn jockey.  Oh, that was funny.  Oh, they heard it. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, we heard it.  It was funny, but he wasn't covered in soot, stupid.  It's soot.  You non-pronouncing ass.  Put a blanket over your cage and go to sleep.  Exactly.  This blanket over the old skull.  That's what you do to old people.  Whenever they start talking to you, once you throw a face cloth on them,  they just think it's nice to fall asleep.  Oh, it's so dark, I've missed my programs.  When I was your age, shut up.  Towel.  Ha, ha, ha.  You know, your father was the... 
[00:35:30]  Towel.  Old bird body grandma.  She still got coffee in her hand, towels over her dumb old face.  You're spilling it.  Stop, you're spilling it.  Oh.  Put this towel over your head and go to sleep.  Your grandson, Frank. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, no.  See, exactly.  I knew it.  What's the matter?  Tom Chiasano just walked in and he's a bird owner.  Oh, no.  I want to complain about your insensitivity to birds.  I own birds.  What kind do you have?  I have an African gray parrot.  Does it talk to you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's a talking bird.  Unfortunately, the talking bird, it sounds all well and fine, but most of the time they're  just going, ack, ack, ack.  What is that?  I like when they go like, hello, hello, hi, hi, Tom, Tom. 
[00:36:30]  But you walk past them and they go, ack.  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  Neighbors think a murder is going on at your house.  You spend an hour trying to get the damn thing to say one lousy word.  One word that's just screaming at you.  You just talk stupid.  This bird talks up a blue streak.  Really?  Yeah.  What does it say?  All sorts of stuff.  All sorts of stuff.  All sorts of different stuff.  Yeah.  It says, may the force be with you. 
[00:37:00]  How old is this bird?  Does it wear glasses?  A geek bird.  We've had a bird for like 18 years.  Wow.  Really?  This bird will outlive me easy.  They live like 50 years.  Does it say, why didn't you give me more money?  In February, it was going, Matt, you should have hired me instead.  Matt?  Wow.  How old do they get?  They live to be like 50.  Jeez.  50 or 60.  And is it true you put the cover on? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  At night.  Yeah.  You cover them up at night.  And it falls right to sleep.  Good night.  He says, yeah.  Good night.  It says good night.  It says good night, you idiot.  Right.  I mean, it only says good night because they've heard my wife and I saying good night to it  and my son saying good night to it for the years when we would cover him up.  Nothing inappropriate.  It's all conditioned response.  The bird doesn't say anything inappropriate, maybe heard a couple of things.  No.  One of my son's friends told him to say, cook me.  That's about it. 
[00:38:00]  That's about it.  No, like, dirty words or anything.  It's FCC compliant.  Yes, it is.  As a matter of fact, I think it would have been a better hire before us to hire the bird.  Hey, it's my bird.  Of course, it says you see compliant.  I would listen to a whole radio show hosted by a talking bird.  Yeah, why not?  A boozy, boozy, but.  I'm sorry.  Plus, we have four others.  Four?  You have five birds.  You have five birds, yeah.  Okay.  Crazy bird people.  Yeah.  Those crazy cat people.  My wife is dander allergic to dogs and cats, so we got birds. 
[00:38:30]  Birds.  Two parakeets.  Parakeets just sing, though, right?  Yeah, they're the coolest of the birds.  They make the best noise.  Yeah.  A Belgian canary, which sings beautifully, and a Madagascar parrot, which is blinded when  I and my wife took in as a mercy mission.  Hey, Jim.  Does it talk also?  Uh, no.  No?  Hey, Jim, can you throw a towel over Tom, please?  I said I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm out of here. 
[00:39:00]  Tom just nods off when you put a towel over his head.  I can see where this is going.  All right, I'm out of here.  Right, Tom.  Tom, what's the matter?  Well, we have five.  Ow.  No more insensitive remark about birds and birds owners, please.  I apologize.  They will jump out of anything we talk about, birds.  Except your apology.  On behalf of my lobby, we accept your apology.  There's no carpets in Tom's house.  It's all just newspaper on everything.  Oh, they eat everything.  Eat everything.  Really?  Well, you got to buy them birdseed.  But carpet, wood, you name it. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, it's eaten through a frame of a window.  Wait, do you live in a home or you live in an apartment?  Home.  Okay.  Hmm.  That makes sense.  Home with a bunch of holes near the windows and big patches missing from the carpet.  Birds are loud, though.  My grandmother had it years ago.  They just make noise.  That's all they did.  When they could talk, it is wonderful.  It's fun.  I like when you see a big parrot somewhere and it's talking.  But like I said most of the time, ah!  Can we lock that side door, please?  No.  Holy crap.  If Tom wants to come in and contribute, he has Carter's on show. 
[00:40:00]  And it was terrific.  He had bird information.  I don't mind so much.  He couldn't get in here fast enough to talk about birds.  He owns birds.  Birds.  Stupid animals, right?  They show no affection.  Whatsoever to their owners, no matter how much love you pour on them, they will treat  a burglar in your house the same way.  My ex-girlfriend has a bird and she thinks this bird is really something.  So I met it and I wanted to punch it in the face because I was trying to be nice. 
[00:40:30]  It's like, just be nice to him.  And he's on my shoulder and he starts nibbling in my ear.  And I'm like, take this piece of crap off my shoulder or I'm going to pick it up in my  hand and throw it at your face.  There are people that own snakes that are like, no, you won't believe the amount of love and  affection this snake can show.  No, it can't.  No.  It has no eyebrows.  It cannot even give you an emotional look like he's happy or sad or pleased that you're 
[00:41:00]  home again.  That tongue just darts in and out looking for something to bite.  That's it.  Oh, ready to cue?  And this is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neill.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  Sunday, I woke up with a chisel going through my ear.  Just a chisel.  That's what it felt like.  So I had to lay there and watch the Cinemax Star Wars marathon that was on for 18 billion 
[00:41:30]  hours of just Star Wars.  That's all you did yesterday?  Dude, I watched from the first one to the last one all in a row.  Just kept watching it and kind of got an appreciation for a few things that I kind of bashed in  the past and other things that were kind of silly.  Like what?  Some furry thing that Lucas had made so we could sell it?  Exactly.  Now, Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie out of all of them. 
[00:42:00]  And I even mean the new ones with all the whining of Hayden Christensen.  You know, Return of the Jedi, horrid puppet show.  It's a puppet show.  It's not a Star Wars movie.  It's a puppet show.  That's all you saw with these little stupid Lucas puppets, Muppets.  What noise did the Ewoks make?  Was that their noise?  Oh, they would just...  And it was... 
[00:42:30]  I've sat through it just going, I have to watch it because I'm watching them all.  Yeah.  And it was awful.  The newer ones kind of got more of an appreciation for those, even though I can't stand the whiny  Hayden Christensen with his, just, just...  It's not fair!  Why can't I be a Jedi master?  Shut up!  Stop your whining!  But the battle scenes and lightsaber battles, you cannot compare the early Star Wars. 
[00:43:00]  You know, the original Obi-Wan and Darth Vader lightsaber battle is so lame compared to,  you know, the Qui-Gon and Sith and young Obi-Wan lightsaber battle is amazing.  You got to explain to people, you watched it on High Def too, right?  Yeah, High Def on Cinemax.  So, you know, that was, it was my Sunday recoup day.  Well, that's the problem with the High Def.  When you see some of these older movies, you see all the patching and the mistakes and...  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  You know, how they...  They did a good job, technically, of fixing the early ones.  I mean, you know, Lucas did a good job of, and I don't mean adding in the crap stuff that  a lot of people say, why don't you just leave it alone and stuff, but just to make it look  better.  Take the hiss out.  If you looked at a lot of the Imperial cruisers in the space scenes, you'd see this discolored  gray box around them as they were kind of flying through space because of the way they  had to do the matting back then and stuff. 
[00:44:00]  So, now they fixed all that, so it's a lot clearer.  The models still hold up, I think.  They look great.  Yeah.  As opposed to the CGI that they used in everything now.  But, yeah, there's things that are good with the old ones and things that are good with  the newer ones.  I never saw the newer ones.  I got a new appreciation.  I never saw any of the newer ones.  Did you?  No.  You'll throw up over Jar Jar Binks.  That was another thing.  Like, right when that first one of the new ones came on, I was just like, oh, yeah, this  one.  This thing.  Oh, this one. 
[00:44:30]  This kid's movie.  How do you talk?  Mesa.  Mesa want blah, blah, blah.  Oh.  Oh.  Lucas is a putt.  What a douche.  He's a putt.  What a great franchise that could have really gone well.  Like, the second one out of the new ones, Clone Wars?  Sure.  Best one out of the new ones, I think.  A lot of great battle scenes.  Pretty dark.  You still had the whiny friggin' Anakin. 
[00:45:00]  But at least he started, you know, at that point, he started turning a little dark and  evil and stuff like that.  So that was pretty good.  And, again, the space battles put to shame anything.  You watch the original where the X-Wings are coming into the Death Star and, you know,  it's pretty much them throwing M-80s on a model with some sparklers involved.  And then you watch the new scenes where there's, you know, hundreds of ships in one shot firing  at each other and just flying really close and big Imperial battle cruises and the smaller 
[00:45:30]  fighter ships.  It just looked really good.  A lot of color.  And then you look at the early ones and go, oh, well, that's all you did all day, though.  That was it.  All six movies.  That was my entire Sunday.  Star Wars.  That was it.  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  WXRK. 
[00:46:00]  New York.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Colin Quinn.  You listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And the best is Lady Di and Marion.  So you can imagine the worst.  Let's say hi to Mike in Georgia.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey there, Mike.  Hey there, Opie and Anthony.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thanks.  What's up, Mike?  You know, I've just been listening to this Mayor Bloomberg thing, too.  And, you know, I'm not a rocket scientist or anything. 
[00:46:30]  I didn't, uh, I, um, forget it.  I was going to comment on how he sounded like one, and it surprised me, but it came out I  didn't and ruined the whole thing.  I'm figuring that, you know, what gave the kid the cardiac arrest was more or less the,  uh, ball and not the bat.  Well, agreed.  But they're saying that the ball hit him a lot harder because, uh, the kid was using  a, using an aluminum bat.  Well, you know, let's, you know, they got an elbow guard. 
[00:47:00]  They got a face guard.  They got a toe guard.  They got a knee guard.  They got a crotch guard.  Why don't you give him a chest guard and let him go play?  Well, how about this?  Not every kid should be playing baseball.  Well, there you go.  For some reason in America, every kid has to play baseball.  If you can't take a liner to the chest, you shouldn't be playing?  A little, a little tip to the parents out there.  When your kid's in the backyard, maybe try to figure out what they might be good at.  If it's ballet?  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  Like, I say it all the time, but it's been a lot of fun watching my, uh, my wool, my little 
[00:47:30]  nephews grow up and I go to these games.  They go to the, the peewee hockey games and the little league games and stuff.  And, uh, thank God, you know, my nephews, they got, they got some skills.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, but you go.  You go to some of these games and you see some of these kids that they have no business  being on the baseball field.  Yeah.  Maybe they should be on the, in drama class.  You could, you could tell even at a very early age that, uh, some of these kids will  do much better on a stage.  If you know what I mean?  Maybe they should be doing a flower arrangements, something like that. 
[00:48:00]  Whatever.  And not be on the field.  But every, I guess every father wants their son to be a baseball star in America.  So, uh, you know, everyone, everyone throws their kid into the old pool and they just  hope they got a major leaguer.  And dad's the last one to pull them out of there because dad really wants him to, uh,  be a sports kid.  And I tell the story, a kid on first base while the game's going on, kind of like just twirling  around like a ballerina.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And then the, the, the son's, uh, father's on the sideline, just mortified, just trying  to get the kid down into the position, into the first base position.  Kid doesn't care.  He wants to be on a stage.  He wants to go do anything but baseball, but it's obvious the father's kind of pushing  this on him.  Did you?  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I used to spin in a circle.  It was a nervous tick I had.  I would spin once in a circle to the right.  It's so stupid.  I have once in a circle only.  Things are wrong.  Things are wrong.  Spin, all's well.  And I was playing for Young's Glass Service in fourth grade and I was in the outfield 
[00:49:00]  and I was spinning, occasionally spinning.  And now my coach screamed from the sidelines, hey Jimmy, what are you, a ballerina?  I was in right field.  Yeah, of course you are.  Both teams, all the fathers heard it.  Oh, it was awful.  Well, they were probably all looking at you going, what is he doing spinning around?  Way to not wait until I get back into the dugout, coach. 
[00:49:30]  How about a little quiet talking too?  No, you've got to make an example.  How about you take me to the side when no one's looking?  Boy, he took me right out of ballerina school though.  I quit spinning.  Did you stop spinning after that?  No, you're not.  But did you look kind of, you know, limp-wristed while doing it?  No.  That's what I'm talking about.  You spun like a man.  Oh, yeah.  I'll show you, which doesn't work on radio.  Yeah, but I want to see it anyway.  But it would just be a spin, like you'd have to take like a...  Okay, that's silly. 
[00:50:00]  Were your hands on your hips like that?  Or whatever.  Or just whatever you were doing.  And then you did that and everything was right with the world, right?  I don't know why, yeah.  Man.  It's like that.  So when you said ballerina, that touched off a lovely memory.  All you have to do though is go to one game and you realize who's there to play baseball  and who's there because daddy wants them to be a baseball star.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  I was never a sports guy.  You are obviously, you know, talking all the time about basketball and things like that. 
[00:50:30]  Were you one of those though where dad would show up and be proud of your prowess out on  the field or something?  Well, my dad was a basketball star back in the day.  Had to try out for the Knicks.  That's the big story in my family, but he blew it off because of personal issues with  his first wife.  And so I never regretted that one.  Well, she never looked back with regret on that.  She ended up dying.  So she decided to be with his dying wife instead of trial for the Knicks. 
[00:51:00]  I think it was pretty.  Hey, you're not going to get a tear from me.  You're not going to get a tear from me.  You can't.  It's the only reason I'm here.  A fine tragedy like that, that's the only reason I'm on this earth.  I was only joking.  Because then he turned around and married my mom and had six lovely kids.  So there you go.  You wouldn't have been here.  But we were brought up with basketball in our blood, kind of, although I'd never had the 
[00:51:30]  height.  And that was my sport.  I tried the Little League.  And I was like, Jimmy, I was right fielder.  I was scared to be in the batter's box.  I realized early on, that's what I'm getting at, that I got some knowledge.  I realized early on, I don't want to play baseball.  I like playing in the schoolyard with my friends when there's no pressure and there's  no, you know, kid trying to throw a ball as hard as he can and he has no freaking control.  Yeah.  That was never fun for me.  So I said, you know what?  Basketball and running and other things were much more my speed. 
[00:52:00]  I had a good arm.  I could throw really far, really hard, but nothing else.  I was a disaster as far as any kind of sports went.  It was just awful.  What was your favorite sport?  None.  None sport.  Not one sport where you enjoyed it?  There was nothing I did.  I'm not talking about making the high school team or anything, but just one sport growing  up where you're like, you know what?  I like this.  Like, for me, it was basketball.  I could play basketball, and I did when I was a kid, like 12 hours a day. 
[00:52:30]  I hated basketball.  I was bad at everything.  Like, I was bad at everything.  I liked dodgeball because I could throw the ball pretty hard, and I was really skinny,  so I was hard to hit.  That's a sport you play with girls.  No, no, no.  It's a sport.  It's not even a sport.  It's a dumb game you play in gym class.  It's recreation.  Yeah, it's recreation.  It's not a sport.  But that was it.  I mean, things like baseball, I was always the kid that, even if I connected with the  ball, it was an infield out. 
[00:53:00]  It was done.  I couldn't get it over the goddamn heads of the infield.  And two-hand touch football, it's ridiculous.  What am I going to do?  I wasn't big enough to do any blocking, that's for sure, and I couldn't get away from anybody.  So I'd just get slaughtered.  I was a little, like, string bean.  Hockey, there was no hockey.  Oh, I loved hockey growing up.  We used to play stupid, like, floor hockey.  I loved floor hockey.  In gym, and there was always the big douche who would have to check you against the accordion 
[00:53:30]  door that separated you from the girls.  All I pictured were horrified girls looking as they're playing whatever they did over  there with their dyke teacher.  All right, girls, time to climb the rope.  I'll be holding the bottom.  I'll be holding the knot.  Make sure you wear your skirts.  Get those panties off, girls.  As they see, the accordion door just get pushed in because another skinny kid's getting his  head smashed as they check. 
[00:54:00]  Shower time, girls.  Coach, we just got out here.  Shower.  Listen to me.  We're all showering today.  The dyke girl gym teacher.  Why was the gym teacher ever called out for being a dyke, ever?  Every one of them.  Every single one of them was a lesbian in hiding.  And the guy gym teacher was the opposite of that, was like all man ready to punch a fifth  grader in the face.  He was just a miserable F. 
[00:54:30]  Like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman coming into your...  Every male gym teacher was a failed athlete.  Yeah, yeah.  He kind of made it to like the farm team or minor league this, minor league that.  They all got a story.  Or went to Europe to play his sport.  And then finally he had nothing left.  So he's like teaching gym class to a bunch of freaking burnouts.  And the goof to all those guys is, well, you watch.  You'll be teaching gym class.  Right.  No, I won't.  You know, I'm making the cut. 
[00:55:00]  I'm going to make the team.  And then they don't make it.  And they take out all their aggression and aggravation on kids.  But dude, in my junior high and high school, the female gym teacher, she was more of a  male than I was.  Yeah.  Like no one noticed this.  And she was allowed access to the...  Oh, smorgasbord for her.  To the dressing room or the showers, whatever.  Locker rooms.  Whatever.  The showers.  Because you never think that the gym teacher could be a lesbian.  Like she's just kind of, you know, monitoring and... 
[00:55:30]  She's a tomboy that never grew out of it.  And she's 45 years old.  With the short hair.  And the big oversized sweatshirt.  Short gray hair.  You know the look.  Like, what is going on here?  Protect your...  Awful.  And when you're in junior high, as a girl especially, you have no clue about being a lesbian.  You have no idea for the most part.  Especially back when we were going to school.  Now, I'm sure they're a little more open to all that stuff.  And they're growing up a lot faster.  But back in the day, these girls had no clue. 
[00:56:00]  And they just thought it was safe to be kind of naked for the gym teacher.  Yeah.  Imagine what that gym teacher was thinking.  And she's just making believe she has to do something in the locker room.  And...  Oh, I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  Jim teacher walks in.  I got...  I got to get the girls out to the closet.  Suit up, girl. 
[00:56:30]  Girls, suit up.  I...  And in my school...  For some odd reason, the gym teacher's office was in the locker room.  In the locker room.  What the hell was that about?  And it was kind of like a booth with, like, windows.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  So she's sitting there on the phone making believe she's getting ready for the big game or ordering  more dodge balls, whatever the hell they did.  Picture your cubicle at work in a strip club.  That's where they work.  I got a...  Oh, phone call.  Let me make...  I'm having trouble with my whistles.  Yeah, we need... 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to need...  Another gross of dodge balls.  Some...  Field hockey shin pads.  You guys...  Dry off well.  You don't want to get athletes full.  What?  The off is right in the locker room.  I swear to God.  Oh, I never even...  I totally just... 
[00:58:00]  You totally made me remember that.  That is the funniest thing I've heard in weeks.  And I told you this story.  I've mentioned the high school.  I better not.  But it's long gone because they finally remodeled.  But I was one of those...  I helped out the coach.  Coach.  I forgot.  We had a little title.  Like we were coaches, helpers, whatever.  I don't know what the hell it was.  Wow.  But we had access to his office, which was right next to the women's locker room. 
[00:58:30]  His office was not in the locker room like the girls was.  The girl teacher and coach.  And we noticed this cork board that had all the schedules and stuff.  And one day, I don't know, maybe it was passed down from generation to generation,  but someone just knew to close the door, lock it, and remove the cork board.  And there was a fine, fine hole that went right through.  A little key hole.  Right through, not just a wall, like it was those blocks. 
[00:59:00]  Cinder blocks.  Cinder blocks, thank you.  This hole went all the way through the cinder block.  Someone worked very hard.  And I guess I finally was invited into the inner circle.  And I was like, hey, you want to see something?  I'm like, yeah, whatever, we're just sitting around talking about the Knicks or something dumb  because we're all obsessed with basketball.  And one kid's like, you want to see something?  I'm like, what?  He goes, oh, trust me on this.  So they locked the door, and they removed the cork board, and there's a hole.  And he waited as the period is ending. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And all the girls file into the locker room, removes the cork board, and it was like...  Wasn't covered by a poster of Rita Hayworth.  And I hate to say this because I know a lot of people who went to high school listened to this show.  They'd shatter.  I saw most...  We were watching you.  I saw most of the girls that I graduated with naked.  Oh, what a thrill.  Naked.  That was about the biggest thrill you could possibly have was the thought that you were going to see them naked. 
[01:00:00]  It was actually the thought...  When I would watch the girls come out of the locker room, the thought that they were just naked was enough to get you all worked up.  Sure.  That was like, oh, and then you'd be next to the locker room, the girls' locker room, and think, right behind this wall, it's just a little wall, is just paradise.  There it is. 
[01:00:30]  And it's what they call sanity that kept you from just running in there.  Because there was...  We talked yesterday about the over-the-top guy, guy that didn't know how far to push it.  Yeah.  There was always a kid every year or so that would just run into the girls' locker room.  He just couldn't take it anymore.  I can't take it.  I gotta see this.  His little perf switch went off.  Oh, and the news would spread through the school.  He'd be in trouble.  It was just...  Yeah, his little perf switch went off, and he had, I gotta get in there.  It's just tempting you. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  It tasked me.  It says it right on the door.  Girls' locker room.  It says, nude girls are in here.  Right.  I'm...  Hormones are pumping.  I'm going through a time of my life where I can't keep this thing in one spot.  And there's a door, there's a sign on it that might as well just say, all of your nude  girl dreams right here.  It doesn't even have a locking knob on it.  You didn't know how...  You're pushing it open.  You didn't know how you... 
[01:01:30]  What the hell was going on down below?  No.  Oh.  You're just trying to keep it under control.  I gotta get in there.  Right.  It's like Regis.  I gotta get in there, Gellman.  There's no girl!  The worst would be if you time it wrong and you run in while they're still dressed.  So you're thrown out of high school and you saw nothing.  And they'd just turn around fully clothed going, what is this idiot doing?  You really had a guy that would just run in there?  Yeah.  Every year or so there was some guy that would just lose his mind.  And have to run in, usually with something like a bandana around his face or something. 
[01:02:00]  But everyone knew who everyone was.  Yeah.  So you'd get busted.  I worked out at a gym that I gotta keep this on the QT too.  Oh, you're only talking to a couple of people.  And there was a cork board.  Another cork board.  Those cork boards.  With like the yoga class schedule and the spinning schedule and, you know, massages when you can get a massage.  Nice gym.  And I discovered, because one day I'm just looking at the schedules and I just kind of take a little glance to the left and I'm like, oh my God. 
[01:02:30]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Perfect shot at the mirror in the girls' locker room that bounced off to the nudity.  And I would just stand there in between sets like making believe I'm looking at the yoga schedule over and over.  Boy, he sure is interested in that yoga schedule.  Oh, and I couldn't believe that no one discovered this. 
[01:03:00]  And it wasn't, you didn't, you didn't have to look like a creep.  You were just looking and just kind of looked over to your left and boom, mirror, boom.  And you would just wait for the hot chick to be done with her workout and you would, time to check the yoga schedule, hoping, hoping, hoping.  And it was like fishing.  I'll tell you who else knew it.  The person who wrote the yoga schedule.  Who else would put that faggoty nonsense on the wall?  You occasionally get that in bathrooms or bars or something like that.  Yeah.  Perfect timing.  You're walking by, the door flings open. 
[01:03:30]  You could look in the mirror.  It's a girl coming out of the stall.  You don't really see anything, but you're like, hey, who?  Just got a little view into the inner sanctum.  All right.  Anyway, the female gym teacher bit is beyond hilarious.  Why they put her office, it's great.  I swear to God.  Brought that up.  I know.  I remember it.  Oh, it was in yours too?  Yeah.  The office was in the locker room?  The office was in it.  It was a way to save space.  I don't know what that was about.  There were a couple of times after school hours, if I was in the school for any reason 
[01:04:00]  whatsoever, I don't even know why I'd be in there, but no one was in there.  Me and a couple of friends would go into the girls' locker room just to look around.  And that was like.  And see what it was like.  It's like, yeah.  That would get your mind going.  You'd go up to the bench.  Find out whose locker it is.  Oh, yeah, I know this chick.  Oh, wow.  Tomorrow should be naked right in front of this locker.  Like a dog.  Can you do the dyke gym teacher? 
[01:04:30]  All the clueless young teenage girls.  Yeah, my girls should be coming in soon.  They've been out playing field hockey.  We just need another order.  What are we looking for?  We need some uniforms.  And you've got to.  The team.  And you've got to order the giant ball that no one knows why.  Yeah, we need the big round ball that they lay on and roll around on their little bellies.  All right.  Oh, here they come.  Hold on.  All right, girls.  Shower time.  I'll be your home. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, my gosh.  What?  Get undressed, girls.  That's it.  Get clean.  That's what I taught you in health class because I'm also the health teacher.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You're beautiful. 
[01:05:30]  Ladies, make sure you wash your guests.  Wash right there.  Are the schools that clueless?  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, put the gym teacher's office right there.  It'll keep it all convenient.  They can talk with the girls.  I bet you that's how the dykey gym teachers chose their job.  They probably went from school to school and went, wait.  Wait a minute.  Where's the office?  Oh, we decided to conserve space, and your office is going to be in the women's locker room. 
[01:06:00]  Okay.  Don't care about the pay.  Whatever.  I'll be in.  What time do I start?  Now?  When do the naked girls come in?  Where's my whistle?  Oh, it's wonderful.  Your office is right off of the teacher's lounge thing.  Goodbye.  See you later.  All right.  We'll break.  We'll continue.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[01:06:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 KROQ.  I was shopping for it.  92.3 KROQ.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Big Kev.  You know, I heard you guys talking about how, you know, there's some issues with guest stars and celebrities.  Yeah.  I have a celebrity for you right now.  All right.  It's Ruth Buzzy. 
[01:07:00]  Ruth Buzzy?  Hold on.  I'll put her on.  Hello?  Hey, Ruth Buzzy.  You're talking to Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Am I talking to Opie and Anthony?  Hi, Ruth Buzzy.  You are talking to Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  How are you?  And you're on in 18 cities right now, Ruth.  18 cities?  Yes.  Wow.  That's a lot of cities.  Ruth Buzzy.  You may remember her from Ronan Martin's Laugh-In.  And then the last seven years, Sesame Street.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Dean Martin roasts. 
[01:07:30]  Dean Martin roasts.  A lot of people think, a lot of people say, oh, it's so wonderful to see that you're on  another television series with that character.  I just love that character.  Right.  And I just go along with it.  Yeah.  Hey, Ruth.  Because they show that so much.  They think it's a series.  Hey, Ruth.  What?  Do you think anyone cares what you've been up to?  Do I think anybody cares?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That I've been up there?  Does anyone...  Do you think...  Do you, you, Ruth Buzzy... 
[01:08:00]  I am not listening to this.  I am not listening.  You mean think that anybody cares that I'm up here in Jersey?  I love the studio.  Does any...  Do you think, Ruth Buzzy, that anyone cares what you've been up to with your life?  Well, I guess so, because why are you talking to me?  I'm not part of this.  I can't even listen.  I haven't listened.  I'm plugging my ears.  I actually met Ms. Buzzy on a plane.  She was very nice.  I got her autograph about two years ago going to Las Vegas.  Oh, my God. 
[01:08:30]  Ruth?  Yes?  You see the big guy with you?  Big Kev?  Yes?  He told me to say that to you.  Oh, okay.  So, if you got that pocketbook of yours, why don't you hit him across his big sky?  No, I'm not going to...  He's too nice.  I'm not going to hit him on the head.  Oh, my God.  I'm not listening.  But I'd like to hit you on the head.  And who's your friend?  He's way, way back.  Tell him to come forth a little more.  No, he doesn't want any part of this. 
[01:09:00]  Why is that?  He doesn't care for my work, huh?  Is that why?  I love you, Ruth Buzzy, and I am sorry, and I'm embarrassed about Opie.  Oh, don't be embarrassed about Opie.  We all understand.  We all understand.  Do you think anyone cares about your career right now?  Oh, God.  Stop it.  My husband and I.  Stop it.  What kind of a question is that?  Stop it.  What kind of a question is that?  I came to...  I went to all this trouble to get down here to do this interview, and why are you asking 
[01:09:30]  me something like that?  Oh, no.  You can't answer?  I don't need to.  I hear silence.  I don't need to.  Am I just a joke to you guys?  Oh, no.  No.  No.  I think so.  I'm smelling a little rat here.  No.  No.  You're not a joke to us.  You're too smart.  I'm too smart? 
[01:10:00]  You're too smart for that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So.  All right, Ruth.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Oh.  I want you to know that I'm up here at the Chilla Theater.  If you want to come and see...  And check me out and see how smart I am.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  I met Ruth on a plane, and she was very nice.  I got an autograph.  She signed my business card for me going to Vegas.  Now, let me ask you a question.  And you were very nice to me. 
[01:10:30]  Why did you ask me for an autograph?  Because I always enjoyed you.  Oh, good.  Oh, okay.  That makes me feel better.  And my friend told me that Ruth Buzzi is on our plane, and we got off, and I believe it  was Vegas.  And you were very nice, and you signed...  What was it?  It might have been coming back to Newark.  I don't remember, but you were very nice.  And I still have it.  Good.  Good.  I'm glad to hear that.  Why don't you come out and say hello?  I can't.  I have to work this weekend, or I would.  Yeah.  Okay.  I absolutely would.  Just a caucus.  All right, Ruth.  You know, I saw Ruth Buzzi on Laugh and Dancing.  You know how they used to have the girls dance? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Joanne Worley and Ruth Buzzi and Goldie Hawn, and you'd be dancing in the bikini.  You looked pretty good.  You had a pretty good body on you.  Yeah.  I'm really quite a sexy woman.  Yeah.  Yes.  I think they call that a butter face.  Butter face?  I've been calling a lot of things about my face, but never a butter face.  A butter face.  Get off the floor.  I'm not playing with you. 
[01:11:30]  How many of those...  You get a lot of the great roasts of the Dean Martin and the Sinatra, all those great roasts.  And Rickles?  Look at Jim trying.  Do you know what a butter face is?  No.  Maybe I shouldn't know.  Don't answer me.  No, it's not a bad thing.  Don't answer me.  I might hang up on you.  You wouldn't do that, would you?  Sure.  I'm just trying to make...  If you offended me, sure.  Why not?  I was just trying to have fun with you, and...  There's only 18 different places listening to us.  That's how many people?  You wouldn't hang up. 
[01:12:00]  We were just...  I was just trying to have fun.  I'm just...  No, no, no.  You're okay.  It's the people behind you that are laughing.  I have a feeling they're just laughing at me, not with me.  I'm just a stupid radio guy just trying to make a career, and I thought I was trying  to be, you know...  No, you're being very nice, really.  You are being very, very nice.  I didn't say anything bad.  Wait a minute.  It was Anthony.  No!  You know, yesterday...  I don't know if it means anything, but...  I don't think...  I was with all...  No, not yesterday.  The day before flying yesterday. 
[01:12:30]  I was with a lot of my people from Laugh-In.  Yes.  We had a reunion because Katie Couric came out and flew out to L.A. and interviewed us.  What did you get?  Because we all got inducted into the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame last week.  That's exciting.  For Rona Martin's laughing.  For Rona Martin's laughing.  That's right.  Very cutting-edge program.  Yeah.  I do remember.  And then years ago, I was inducted into the Rhode Island Hall of Fame, which was... 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God!  Because I was born in Rhode Island.  I just realized who you were.  Why is that?  Can you tell us about the upcoming season?  For what?  Sex and the City.  I'm not Jessica.  Is that what you're thinking?  You're not Sarah Jessica Parker?  No, no, no.  People have said that I resemble her.  We both have long faces.  I'd love to be on that show as her mother or her sister or her cousin.  Well, you're both butterfaces.  That's a butterface, huh?  Okay.  I'll take it as a compliment. 
[01:13:30]  You know, everything's hot.  Okay.  I think you guys are having too much fun.  I think I'm going to go and have some fun now.  Wait.  No, no.  Don't hang up.  This is all we have today for our show, and I'm trying to impress my bosses today.  Oh, gee, this is all you have.  You're going to lose your job.  I'm not feeling too good about myself right now.  If butterface is the only thing you have today, you're going to lose your job.  I'm not feeling too good about myself.  I'm sorry.  That's okay. 
[01:14:00]  Very, very nice talking to you.  Okay.  Goodbye, Ms. Buzzy.  I did enjoy talking to you with you.  Thank you, Ruth Buzzy.  Tell your nieces and nephews to come and see us at the Chiller Theater.  Okay.  Who else is going to be there signing?  Who else is there signing?  Oh, just tons and tons of people.  Like who?  I wouldn't even begin to start the list.  Who are you hanging with today, Ms. Buzzy?  Linda Blair.  Does she still have really nice boobs?  I don't know, and I don't care.  We just saw a picture of her.  I really don't care about something like that.  All right.  I'm going to go.  I have to leave because I have to start the show. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Okay?  What's the show?  Well, we have to start our show.  Is that sign autographs and stuff?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on now.  I'm going to give you back to Kevin.  Bye-bye, Ruth Buzzy.  All righty.  Hello?  Hey, Big Kev.  Hey, now see, that's a quality celebrity interview you just did.  Can you get Linda Blair?  I'm working on it.  I'm also working on Jeff Conway.  Oh, man.  Oh, Kinnicky?  And I also had Ron Polillo on the phone, but you guys went to commercial or something. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, Horshack?  Yeah.  Arnold Horshack.  So, do you have anybody?  There's so many quality, quality guest star celebrities here today.  So, once again, Big Kev is at the Hatspin Hall of Fame, where he will be phoning in throughout  the program with some of these fine celebrities.  You will not believe the quality of the celebrities here.  Are there really 18,000 people there?  I think over the span of the entire weekend, there will be.  Hey, did Ruth walk away all happy and light on? 
[01:15:30]  No.  No?  No.  She walked away, but I don't know that she was all happy.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Thank you, Big Kev.  I'll talk to you soon.  All right.  That was so painful.  And here's what really bothers me.  By the end of the interview, Ope is cute and tussleable, and you and me are creeps.  I'm the bad guy.  How did that happen?  I know.  It's the Stockholm Syndrome.  Like when you start empathizing with your kidnappers.  That was horrible. 
[01:16:00]  Horrible.  Horrible.  Jesus.  She wanted to peck your forehead and give your blonde locks a little tussle.  All right.  So, uh...  Oh, you're being nice.  I know you're nice.  I'm nice.  And I'm like...  And you're not nice.  You're not.  You were horrid.  I thought I was very endearing there.  Horrible to her.  I was very nice.  And you weren't.  I think she's going to ask me out for tea or something.  Yeah, sure.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Andre 3000, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Dennis, what's up?  Hello.  I have a fun fact, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now this is better.  Yes.  Okay.  The Ramsey's condom is named for Ramsey's III, the Egyptian pharaoh who had 160 children.  Yeah.  Why would they name a condom after someone that had that many children?  Yeah, that doesn't make sense.  Maybe it's the...  He's probably the worst example of someone who didn't have one.  If you have 160 kids, you certainly could have used one. 
[01:17:00]  I don't think they really put the emphasis with condoms on the fact that they are helpful  in preventing pregnancy and disease.  I think they really want to put the emphasis on virility, and this will really...  Boy, you'll be able to just oomph with this thing on.  You know, the commercials aren't really geared toward that.  I saw one last night, and it was a bunch of pigs, I guess, a bunch of pigs walking around  a bar, fresh, fresh, fresh, that was fresh, fresh, fresh, there's pigs walking around 
[01:17:30]  a bar and some chicks, and then one of the pigs goes up to a condom machine and pulls  out a condom, and all of a sudden he turns into a guy, and he walks up to the bar and  gives the girl, like, a look, like, hey, I got a condom, and of course they're going  to be effing, but nothing about, you know, disease or pregnancy, they like positioning  these condoms like they're going to feel better than if you weren't using one, which, no. 
[01:18:00]  I'll say right now, we, me and my girl are in condom-using phase because her pills got  all screwed up because of the prescription.  Oh, no.  Yes, tell me about it.  Holy mother of God, I haven't used one of those in so long.  Since you were 15.  Oh, and they're awful.  I mean, they're good in the fact that you're, at least you're doing, you're doing it, but 
[01:18:30]  they just do not feel good.  They don't feel like, you know, that when you, when you first start going at it, let's  say, and there's just the initial, you don't get that, that wow.  Wow, that's really good.  It's, uh, it's just not there.  It's awkward.  You're rolling. 
[01:19:00]  Let me roll this down for you.  Ugh, hate them, and I got to deal with it for a month.  Really?  Yep.  Why?  Till the pills kick back in.  I, I wouldn't do it.  I have to.  Why?  Because I don't want kids.  You don't have to have kids.  You're a great gambler.  You, you, you, your odds are way up.  Oh, you think I win?  Please, of course.  Oh, damn, Snake Isaac.  I don't want that.  So are you going to survive the month or what?  Going to have to.  Yeah.  Dude, I have to. 
[01:19:30]  There's no way.  No way am I having any kind of kids.  And back at, I remember some real risks back in my younger days where it was just like,  I don't, there was a girl once and, uh, we were upstate, me, my brother, a bunch of  friends were all upstate and we all had our girlfriends with us.  And, uh, she, um, had, uh, never been with, uh, a man. 
[01:20:00]  Uh, I was going to be the guy.  So.  What a catch for her.  I was going to, it certainly was.  It was a catch for quite a few girls back in those days.  Let me tell you.  They could all tell stories.  I am embedded in many a girl's head.  Did she get on a bus to meet you?  Yes.  We met at the bus station.  I'm indirectly trashing you.  You know, I know.  I don't care.  All right.  All for good radio.  Go ahead.  We're in a, uh, a cabin upstate and, uh, I figure I need, uh, to, I need a condom for 
[01:20:30]  this.  So I knew some of the guys that I was with had been in relationships with these girls  and probably might've had some condoms.  So I'm searching.  But at that point, I swear to you, I did not know what a condom even looked like, like  what it came in.  I knew it, it was a rubber thingy, you know, but I didn't know what it looked like in a  package.  So I went into another room where another couple's in there sleeping and I'm rummaging through  their stuff on the dresser tops on the end tables. 
[01:21:00]  And I grabbed, uh, a girl's, uh, one of the other girls contact cases and went in and went  into the bedroom and go, I think I got some.  And I opened it up and it's a contact lens.  Needless to say, I couldn't use it.  I couldn't put it on.  Not only did she get pregnant, but the kid had 20, 20 vision.  You can put it on like a, like a yarmulke.  Yeah.  That's what I figured.  I figured you just kind of put it on like, and just covered it. 
[01:21:30]  And I knew it wasn't a condom at that point, but you know what I did?  I said, ah, what the hell?  What are the odds?  Roll the dice.  That's it.  Roll the dice.  Because in that situation, uh, that you, you're thinking is definitely impaired.  So, uh, that was it.  That was it.  Luckily, nothing happened.  Uh, but, um, nowadays, no, no. 
[01:22:00]  Don't want a kid.  Too much trouble for all, for all ant.  Why would it be trouble?  You'd be a great dad.  Trouble.  I, I.  You would teach your kid a lot of interesting things.  I'd probably be, uh, one of the best dads in the world.  But, I'm too selfish as a person.  I like my time.  I like what I want to do when I want to do it.  If I want to run off somewhere to, to a casino or to, uh, another resort.  Yeah, but what if you, what if you have one of those cool kids where that doesn't really 
[01:22:30]  interrupt that crap?  Yeah, a cool kid.  I've seen parents out there that end up having cool kids and their life really isn't, uh,  interrupted.  Oh, no.  It's interrupted by the, from the time they come out.  Plus, you got money where you can, like, you know.  For, like, years.  Get people to, like, change those pesky diapers and stuff.  Yeah.  What am I going to have a nanny?  They could do all the dirty stuff for you.  I don't know if you want a nanny raising a kid, to tell you the truth.  You got to do it yourself.  And then, the fact of the matter is, it doesn't matter how cool your kid is, that coolness 
[01:23:00]  ain't going to come out until at least, the earliest, like six.  Then they might be like, wow, your kid's growing up kind of cool.  You could take them places and talk to them like maybe a human being for a few minutes  before they start crying.  And then you got to stoop down and talk on their level.  When I see fathers, I see guys my own age going, what do you want?  Yeah, that's good.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  It's like, oh, my God, he's talking like a baby.  He's an adult talking like a baby.  Did your dad wreck it for you? 
[01:23:30]  Uh, I'm trying to think.  That's what adults do, though.  He might have.  He's supposed to talk like a baby.  I don't like that.  You can't talk to an infant and go, the fourth quarter, stocks are dropping.  Why not?  Because the kid's stupid.  The kid should talk like an adult at that point.  But for those five years, your life is just in limbo.  You're done.  It's spent wiping and cleaning up crying and messes and broken bones and wondering if your  kid's got some frigging mental disease.  I understand all that.  But where does it come from?  Did your dad wreck it for you?  Um, I don't, I don't think so. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe he did because I kind of saw him as being imprisoned by, by kids.  I saw him not wanting.  I really believe this comes from somewhere because I really think, and a couple of people  are calling, they're saying that you would be a great kid.  My daddy had a great love for me.  Believe me.  I know that.  But I felt he was imprisoned by children, like by having a wife and kids.  He didn't want it.  He was selfish, too.  He wanted to go out west and be a cowboy.  And he was young and broke, wasn't he? 
[01:24:30]  This is different.  Being young and broke and like being ready.  But I have the mindset of a young, broke person.  I really do.  But you took notice of something and that planted the seed.  Maybe.  Yeah, you might be right on that one.  But what, you know, so be it.  I can't, I can't fight that.  That is something I just, I have a fear of children, of having children.  I like children.  I like playing with kids.  Kids love me.  Like when I go over houses, unless they're picking their nose and wiping it on my couch. 
[01:25:00]  But when I go over to people's houses and they have kids and stuff, kids love me.  I play with the kid.  I'll throw a ball around or whatever.  But the thought of having my own, oh, never.  Never.  I understand that.  I understand that you're not going to change.  But it's really interesting to see where this comes from.  Yeah, it might be my own horrid childhood that I had as far as parenting went.  And you just took notice.  Yeah, I took notice.  I looked at poor, unhappy dad. 
[01:25:30]  And your mom working her ass off to try to raise three kids.  Yeah, and then mom's got it.  Poor mom.  She's just stuck.  She's stuck.  She got to the point where she finally raised kids and in her 40s, she said, you know something?  Get the F out.  I'm having fun with my life.  You guys, I'm done with you.  And I'm 21 years old or something to go, but mommy, you're kicking me out of the house.  I'm an adult.  And I'm just like, I don't know what to do.  Oh, grow up.  Grow up.  Went out.  I'm stealing people's Hydrox cookies in a room for rent across the hall from me because I didn't know how to make a living for myself. 
[01:26:00]  I thought you got kicked out before 21.  No, it was like 21.  That's not too bad.  That was pretty bad.  Oh, I was living in my car.  No, I know all that.  I thought that was at 17, 18 years old.  No, I was about 21.  17, 18, I was still living with my mom.  And then it just got to the point where she said, that's it.  Get out.  I need to have some fun here and live my life. 
[01:26:30]  I'm done.  And you're like, but, but, but, but, but, but.  I have a room in this house.  Well, what about me?  I, I didn't, I don't have to buy toilet paper.  I got into an apartment and realized I got to buy this stuff.  Shampoo.  How many times I just took soap and rubbed it in my hair.  Yeah.  All right.  We're running late.  We got to take a break.  We're going to continue with that a little bit today.  A little Vico analysis.  No, because I'm trying to figure some of this stuff out.  Yeah.  I'm a, I'm a weirdo. 
[01:27:00]  It's a new phrase, a phrase, a new phase of our relationship.  Yeah.  I want to see where some of this stuff comes from.  Yeah.  I think I know where it comes from.  I think.  Because I really do believe you'd be a great dad.  I think it is the early days of me.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll go to break with this.  Anthony's daycare.  I like this.  Oh, yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You love your kids, but sometimes they can be a handful.  Kids are great when they're other people.  Who can you trust when it comes to your youngins?  You change them.  You wash them.  You bathe them. 
[01:27:30]  Anthony's daycare oasis is a paradise.  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison.  Filled with joy.  We don't think they're cute.  Tenderness.  We think they're annoyed.  And most of all, Anthony's love.  I can only hope your child turns up like little Adam Walsh without his head.  Parents adore our staff.  These guys hate kids.  And our facilities are safe.  I have burning cauldrons of wax just sitting around for aesthetics.  Just listen to these happy children frolic through Anthony's daycare oasis.  I hate your kid. 
[01:28:00]  And I wish him dead.  Just take it from Anthony himself.  Grab your little friggin' rat and say,  We love you, Anthony.  Ugh.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  92.3 K-Rock.  WXRK New York.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:28:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Uh, Mike D. from Chicago writes,  Why doesn't Anthony get a vasectomy?  Because you were talking about how...  Get off.  Get...  Well, you don't want to have kids.  Get out of here.  Wait.  Now, there's not even like a small part of your brain that would consider having a kid.  No.  I don't want a kid.  100% no effin' way, right?  100% no effin' way.  Girlfriend, uh, her pills got messed up, so you have to, like, rap.  Yeah.  So, why don't you get the vasectomy? 
[01:29:00]  Then you never have to worry about that again.  Um, I think mostly...  There's probably a few reasons.  One of which is, uh, I don't like any pain down there.  And I hear there is pain involved.  You gotta take the frozen peas and put them there.  I saw the operation done on, uh, one of these medical channels.  Uh, and it just looks disgusting.  They cut the side, pull out this little piece of spaghetti with a probe, and snip it, and 
[01:29:30]  then burn the ends.  It's a tiny little slit.  The vasectube, yeah.  And then they take tweezers, and they pull that tube out.  Yeah.  And then they chop.  And then they chop a little piece of it out.  It's not even chopped snip.  And the peas...  They snip, snip.  The little piece is, uh, it's, you know, about an eighth of an inch long.  Jimmy's still confused by the peas.  You know, do they...  Do the peas are frozen peas?  Yeah.  The frozen peas are used on...  Yeah, in a bag.  Okay.  And then you...  People use that all the time when they have to ice down an area.  An area that's, you know, not a flat contour.  You know, it's a lot of contours.  They discover that a bag of, uh, frozen peas are very, very good for... 
[01:30:00]  It gets into the nooks and crannies.  ...for, uh, icing down stuff.  Better than ice cubes.  Yeah.  Let me ask you.  I don't know.  The vein that they cut is in your testicles, right?  It's right at the top of, um, where, uh, the, uh, scrotum meets.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's a, uh, an incision that's made there that's about, eh, a quarter to a half  an inch at most at the top.  And then they go in with this, like, hook-like probe and pull out this white tube. 
[01:30:30]  And that's the tube that delivers the baby makers.  Um, and then they, they, they snip a piece out of it.  Right.  So now if, uh...  A little piece of spaghetti, it looks like.  And then they burn, they, they cauterize each end, the open end of what they've cut out,  uh, of...  Oh, I thought they kept that just, uh, like, just a gap there.  And if you were going to get a girl pregnant, you know, your, your guys had to, like, do  an Evel Knievel.  Set up a ramp across the Snake River Canyon or whatever that was. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, wait.  They do leave it connected but burned.  So it's almost like...  No, it's not connected anymore.  So what are they, just free-floating your body?  They, they, I, I think they're just reabsorbed into your body is what happens because they  can't go anywhere.  But that always, I always thought that would make, cause that problem that you get when  you get, um, uh, worked up and can't finish, uh, anything.  You get in severe pain.  Because it seems like if you have something like, if you have a vein that's being pulled 
[01:31:30]  taut between two ends and you snip the middle, doesn't it seem like it would be almost like  a, like a pulled, it would just kind of go back each way like, like window shit.  No, I don't think it's under that kind of pressure.  No, it's kind of loose.  It's just kind of loose and, yeah, it needs room to expand and contract.  If you need to know more, just look to your right, uh, YouTube.  God bless YouTube.  There you go.  Oh, there it is.  A man's vasectomy.  Yep.  Wow.  Right there on YouTube.  When I was looking, they, uh, were poking needles in the old, uh, in the old hornet's  nest.  They were doing the old gag called the, we call that the brain. 
[01:32:00]  That's, that's what I see on my camera.  Anytime Keith, the cop gets it when I'm not around.  Oh yeah.  I've seen Keith.  He's like, yeah, I brained Anthony.  Yeah.  That's, I'll be going through my pictures and go, Oh, Keith.  He'll let, now see, look, look at what he's doing.  Oh, see, I don't need that.  I don't need that done.  Yeah.  But you're not going to feel that.  Oh God.  He just poked with a scissor.  You don't feel that.  I don't care.  You don't.  It's not being done.  That's a big vein.  It's all numb.  It's all numb down there. 
[01:32:30]  They didn't even cut them yet.  No, they didn't.  They're just preparing the area.  They poked it through.  Look, see, now they pull out, pull it out.  Here's the slice.  It's a very little incision.  Look, just enough to pull it out.  Here's the slice.  The slice is nothing.  You can handle that, Anthony.  Oh God.  A little needle in there.  Look, all the guys in this studio right now are holding themselves.  Look at that.  I am holding.  All right.  A little more of a slice.  A little slice.  Looks like he's cutting a worm in half. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looks like a worm.  Yeah.  That's what it looks like.  By the way, someone, Mike D is saying 10 minutes in the doctor's office, you sissy.  Is that it?  10 minutes.  They freeze you up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  10 minutes with the mob.  Oh, that's all.  10 minutes with the mob if you're a rat.  But you're not.  But dude.  It doesn't matter.  Dude.  It's like filling a cavity.  They numb you up.  Hello.  They numb you up and you don't even know what's going on.  When you're done.  And then when the, you know, the Novocaine wears off, you feel it for a little bit. 
[01:33:30]  Uh-uh.  No siree, Bob.  And things look different.  Okay.  I figured they would.  That's the...  Stuff looks different because it's, uh...  Yeah.  No.  Stuff looks different because there isn't an additive in there that is normally involved  in, uh, uh, that.  Is it like going to the diner and if you said, uh, hey, I'd like a glass of milk, please, and  they'd bring you water instead.  Exactly. 
[01:34:00]  That's exactly it.  If you were to take that glass of water and throw it on your girlfriend's back, it would  look silly.  You still want a good presentation.  Right.  You want a nice presentation in the air.  I want a nice presentation.  I don't want anything screwed up like that.  But would the glass of milk be fuller than the glass of water or would they be the same,  the same size?  I believe the same size, uh, uh, glass of water or milk.  Oh, that's fine.  But it just would freak me out, uh, seeing, uh, water being spilled everywhere. 
[01:34:30]  Why?  Instead of, uh, a glass of milk being spilled.  I prefer it.  It would just look...  No, why?  Why?  Because if you spill milk all over the sofa, it's a pain in the ass to clean up.  You spill water, no one notices it.  And there goes...  Jack-Jack, take care of it.  Stupid Jack-Jack.  Steve from Bayshore, give me...  Okay, terrific.  Oh, look, he's tugging now.  He's tugging.  He's snipping the vein.  Yeah, this is all... 
[01:35:00]  Look.  I can't even watch this.  Look.  It's no big deal.  Dude, that is not what you want to see.  And there you go.  You don't want to see anyone doing...  What is he using?  He's using, like, wire cutters.  Yeah, they gotta...  They gotta follow procedure, man.  You would think this would have been done by now.  Didn't you used to think doctors were very delicate with surgery?  Oh, man.  Where it was, like, and then they very delicately cut things and move things around.  They are working in there like mechanics on a car.  They're pulling, chiseling, sawing things. 
[01:35:30]  All the surgeries I see on TV now, yeah, it's deeply disturbing.  Oh, they're pulling how rugged they are.  They're very rough with their surgery.  They dab.  They constantly dab that cock.  Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab.  It's like trying to get the little...  There it goes.  He just cut.  It's like trying to get the little bit of jelly out of a jelly jar.  Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.  Clang, clang, clang.  I don't need any of that.  I'm not getting one of those.  It's been suggested a couple of times, but my answer is always nine. 
[01:36:00]  Nine!  Well, you can have it.  The thing is, the amazing thing is that you can have it undone.  If you want to have kids someday, they can reverse the procedure.  It's not the fact that wanting to have kids...  Yeah, he doesn't want to have kids.  I don't want to have that done to me.  It really does.  That's what it comes down to.  You don't want to have that.  That's something I don't want to have done to me.  It looks like they have a man's bald skull trapped in a vice.  Exactly.  And they're removing his brain stem.  Like above the eyebrow ridges, they just have his head closed. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  It looks like a cancerous tumor.  It's not the tumor.  The sequel to Silence of the Lambs, and they had Ray Liotta, and they opened up his head.  Opened up the top of his head in one of the most ridiculous scenes in movie history.  Exactly.  Way to wreck a great franchise.  The top of his head is off, and his brain is showing.  Karen, those brains are all I had.  They were going to eat them.  No, they weren't.  And then he just walks into the room with the top half of his head off.  Yeah.  I'm like, what are you doing to this great franchise? 
[01:37:00]  I don't think brains have that much steadfastness to just stay there with the top of the skull off.  I think they spill out.  All right, let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Ant.  I just wanted to tell you what happens when a vasectomy goes wrong.  I had it done about 10 years ago.  Excuse me.  And the doctor's in there, and you stay awake, and he numbs the area, makes the slice. 
[01:37:30]  He's cutting the vas deferens tube.  He cuts it in two different spots.  He cuts, cauterizes each end, puts the titanium clips so nothing, like there's no, nothing left of chance.  And I mean, in the long run, it's worth it.  But when I was in there, I saw the smoke start coming up and the smell when he's burning the tube.  And he's like, dude, don't pass out.  I said, I'm passing out.  I'm going to be sick.  He's like, count the tiles on the ceiling. 
[01:38:00]  He goes, do anything.  Just hang on.  And I said, let go of my, let go.  It felt like he's squeezing and twisting the area.  And I said, let go of it.  He goes, I'm not touching it.  And both him and the nurse both put all their hands up.  And I said, it feels like somebody's down there squeezing it and twisting it.  And he's like, just hang on.  Don't pass out.  And let me tell you something.  It was the worst half hour of my life.  I couldn't believe the pain. 
[01:38:30]  I'll tell you what.  In the long run, it's worth it, definitely.  Yeah, well, obviously they did something a little wrong.  There's a lot of people calling in saying it's no big deal.  A lot of people, a lot of my friends said they have it.  I must have went to, like, Dr. Frankenstein or something.  Well, you don't ever want your doctor going, dude, don't pass out.  You never want a doctor giving a vasectomy, talking to you like he's your buddy in Nom.  Yeah.  Stay with me.  All right.  Thank you.  Ace of Spades.  Yeah, he's sitting in the back.  Jack of Clubs.  He's throwing around death cards. 
[01:39:00]  This guy's holding his groin, sitting in the back seat.  Harvey Keitel's telling him you're going to be okay.  Creepy.  Any man holding his junk can drink out of my canteen anytime.  Drink patty water.  Let's say hi to Randy.  Patty water.  In Chicago.  Randy.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  Well, we're hoping we're going to be on in Chicago for a while to come.  We still haven't had a real good shot at Chicago, but we're hearing things.  We're hearing things.  Things.  As soon as you said that, I started panicking.  I'm like, I need to call right now because I don't want you guys to leave. 
[01:39:30]  You guys are awesome, man.  Thank you.  Well, the word's going around that Fresh has been registered to this fine station you're  listening to us on, CKG.  So we don't know what that means, to be quite honest with you.  It could just be.  I don't know what it could be, actually.  But we're hoping that we get to survive because we like Chicago.  What do you got, Randy?  Oh, I just want to clear up one thing that Anthony said.  There's no difference in the texture or what it looks like.  I've had a vasectomy, and this is like my third year. 
[01:40:00]  And there's no way you could tell between water and milk.  Now, how is that possible when the stuff that is, yeah, the powdered milk, say you're using  powdered milk, and you use water and the powdered milk.  If you take away the powdered milk, you're just going to end up with water.  How about we just get a doctor on the line instead of a listener from Chicago?  How about Dr. Steve? 
[01:40:30]  Let's get a doctor on the line, and we'll answer that question.  Okay.  But Randy's saying there's no difference.  There has to be.  Dan says there has to be.  There are two compositions to what we're talking about, to this, you know, when a woman gets  pregnant, she supplies the egg, and the man supplies the sperm cell.  Yes.  Now, the sperm cell has to travel in semen, which is excreted from the prostate. 
[01:41:00]  And that's what it travels in.  It needs some kind of fluid to travel in.  If you are just taking the fluid from the prostate, it's colorless.  The color is added in because of the population of sperm cells.  So if you take that out of the mix, it's going to be clear.  Maybe that's not the only thing that colors it.  I think it is.  But the key here is I have no idea what I'm talking about. 
[01:41:30]  I know.  Let's get a doctor on the line.  I actually just looked at you and said, well, maybe it doesn't.  Like, if you would have said, the sperm does not at all have anything to do with the color,  I might have said, well, maybe a part of it might.  No matter what you said, I would have just conjectured.  Let me also put it this way.  There is a certain substance beforehand that men deal with that is colorless.  Alcohol?  That I'm trying to be as nice as possible here and not get dumb because we are having an intelligent medical conversation here. 
[01:42:00]  You know what I'm talking about?  It's clear.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That is what you're talking about.  That is exactly the same stuff you're talking about as later on what happens when it's mixed with the cells that then can impregnate women.  So if you take the cells out, it's going to look like that the whole time.  Okay.  But don't they say that, you know, if you're with a girl and you're hooking up, that she can't â€“ you have to be careful the whole time through. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, in the very beginning, if you're in â€“  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of the cells can get through and swim around in that.  Well, that's dangerous.  But it's such a small number, you don't notice any color difference.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get a doctor to answer a couple of these questions.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Michael Shiklis.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:43:00]  We got a guy on the phone, Steve, from Orange County.  Steve.  Yo.  You want to wake up your spouse?  Yeah.  All right.  Give us some details here.  Is it your wife, girlfriend, boyfriend?  What do you got?  My wife.  All right.  Your wife.  And how are you going to wake her up?  I got a blowtorch.  Jimmy said it's wake up your wife with a blowtorch.  Wake her up with a blowtorch.  Wait.  Did you suggest that, Jimmy, yesterday?  I was saying that should be the name of the bit, yes, wake up your â€“  But I was just being a goose.  Well, what are you going to do with the blowtorch, sir?  All I got to do is walk in and light it up. 
[01:43:30]  You know, it's pretty loud when it lights up.  It'll get things going.  You know what I mean?  Get a nice pop.  All right.  Do you promise us that you're not going to, like, burn your wife or burn down your house?  We'll try to keep away from the curtains and the hair.  All right.  Here's Stephen Orange County.  He wants to wake up his wife with a blowtorch.  Hmm.  Wake up, honey. 
[01:44:00]  Wake up.  Why are you doing that?  It's wake up your spouse, sir, Wednesday with a blowtorch.  He did it.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  He really did.  I heard this.  Hey, Steve, that's all right, man.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Take care.  Thank you.  Just a quickie to kick off wake up your spouse Wednesday.  With a blowtorch. 
[01:44:30]  He did it with a blowtorch.  He took you seriously, Jimmy.  What an awful thing to wake up to.  She's like, what are you doing?  Steve, what are you doing?  I bet you that's what a lot of people say when their spouse ends up murdering them.  Yeah.  Because you don't expect it.  All of a sudden, you're like, what are you doing with that axe?  That's the last thing you say.  Hey, you know what?  I think...  Doing that hammer, Carl.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:45:00]  I think there's a lot of surprise, the last thing you say, before your spouse kills you.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what are you doing?  That's what she said right there.  That could have been like...  That could have ended with...  A murder.  Her whole body up in flames.  But there you go.  Now I'm thinking that the bit has finally officially taken off.  Because now I know our listeners, they're going to try to figure out a better way to wake  up their spouse.  How do you beat blowtorch?  The audio could have been better, but you got the groggy audio of the wife going, Steve,  what are you doing? 
[01:45:30]  Swanson.  Hey, I want to know if I can substitute wake up your spouse for wake up your brother.  Yeah, it's basically wake up someone you live with.  Just wake up anyone in the house.  But we had to come up with some kind of name for this dumb thing.  So, yeah, sure.  How are you going to wake him up, Swanson?  Actually, I'm just going to walk in screaming.  Okay.  What? 
[01:46:00]  What the hell's it going to happen with you?  that is fantastic  who was it he woke up yeah swanson how old's your brother um 12 12 12 oh that's why he was like 
[01:46:30]  because he reverted back to being about four or five and then he sounded like an almost teenager  but he started like mommy yeah i think my mom's gonna use this as a reason for me uh that i'm  being influenced by you guys now wow that's all right there you go we got two already wow we've  been doing this bit for about a month we get one here and there and already we got two okay gotta  go guys all right you're a good boy sometimes it takes a while to get these bits going so there 
[01:47:00]  you go all right it's wake up here's past wednesday so far we got a blowtorch and a guy screaming  that was an obnoxious scream it really was it's opian anthony the opian anthony show  really fast anthony had a uh a neighbor moment 
[01:47:30]  yeah it was just quick i love my suburban neighborhood we like going into anthony's  neighborhood every once in a while because if you know anything about uh anthony and now there's  people in pittsburgh and west palm beach they don't really know us yet no but uh we're being heard  finally back in philly and boston and other places where they they know a lot about us the people in  like boston and worcester they kind of know like what uh where i came from i lived in ashland  mass i lived in ashland mass enough said i lived in a housing complex amongst the brazilians 
[01:48:00]  where they were actually they had chickens in their on their patios and uh yeah so i finally uh decided  very recently to grow up and by very recently i mean three months ago or so and i decided to make my  first ever house purchase and i moved to a neighborhood that is full chock full of jews  because uh and i'm a catholic roman catholic guy but i just love the jews in the neighborhood 
[01:48:30]  because the lawns are perfectly kept by mexican landscapers they uh they're nice you know they give  a little wave howdy neighbor they all own nice cars and everything that's what i just a nice suburban  neighborhood that's what i like and you know i've made contact with the next door neighbor a little  bed and there's kind of some scuttlebutt around the neighborhood about me and i guess they're talking 
[01:49:00]  amongst themselves uh if it's a good thing that i live there i think there's a little gossip which is  just part of suburbia they're going to be all gossipy you know but no harm done it's not like  living in the city where a pizza delivery guy uh comes to your house and gets shot in the face and  robbed that's that or there's roaches oh it's just weird because you don't want to uh communicate with  anybody really let's be no that's the hardest part i'm very uh we get these updates from kind of 
[01:49:30]  time you've had the neighbors come over with like uh baked goods baked goods invite them in or not  i don't know the protocol taking their baked goods at the front door and pretty much slamming the  door in their face but finally you invited them in for for a quick moment no i never invited them in  oh i thought you did no one time they were going to a movie when we did invite them in and told them  we have nothing here i mean we just moved in and then after a while they gave us some more time came  over with some baked goods and uh i i guess we were supposed to invite them in and make some coffee and 
[01:50:00]  then share the baked goods but we kind of just grabbed the baked goods shut the door and that was it  with the chains still on the lock and then they are the chain yeah they're just hello what do you  want yeah they're just squishing the muffins through the little space that you allow not even open the  door through the intercom hello what do you want hi it's your neighbors whatever you got leave it on  the uh mat and go away and let me see your hands let me see your hands as you're back away from the door 
[01:50:30]  i'm not a very social person and throughout my life in my living circumstances i don't know how to  socialize i i just have a great visual of of them with a i'll call it a bunt cake wasn't a bunt cake  and you only give them like two inches so they're just shoving the cake cut it cut it into slivers and  slide it under the door you think one of them was ever walking their door like like nine at night  and it's all dark outside so the light in your apartment is illuminated your house and they look  through the crack and they just see you and that nazi jacket marching around your living room talking to 
[01:51:00]  yourself in your underpants you're just wearing the top half of the uniform look i hope i i certainly  hope no iron i don't wear a nazi uniform around the house i don't own a nazi uniform he only waits  for the full moon i am a fan he doesn't have to turn his lights on so people aren't on to him i am a fan  of the 40s and the war era black socks halfway up his thigh i own a british infield rifle it was a  nazi killer i don't own nazi paraphernalia trying to envision what you look like i'm thinking black 
[01:51:30]  socks halfway up his calves his underpants not not boxer briefs but underpants tightly cropped with  the socks with he has his socks he has the little thing that holds them on his calves and then only  the top half of the uniform and he's on the porch with a broomstick like it's a rifle he's just holding  i know and they go anthony and i don't they were such snappy dressers weren't they snappy well come  on now they were you gotta give them that i i did have a little bit of a frightening moment there 
[01:52:00]  last night yeah what happened well i was alone uh last night uh my girlfriend went uh out shopping  and uh i i'm alone in the house so i'm just kind of laying why am i alone why why am i alone i'm watching  tv and i hear a door open i hear a little creak like a and i look at the alarm and i realize oh my 
[01:52:30]  god i hadn't set the alarm i i i now i i tripped up i didn't set the alarm and i hear a door distinctly  hear a a creak of a door opening and it's very loud so i know it's not the tv it's not some neighbor  thing please tell me you almost shot an innocent victim dude i go right tell me i go right for the  gauge right for the 12 i i uh i put on my jammy pants and now i realize i still have no curtains up 
[01:53:00]  so if anybody's looking at the house they're looking at a lunatic in his pajama bottoms toting a 12 gauge  down his stairs yelling you best come out mother effer or you're dead you do know this was all in  your mind right no no no i it was a creaking door there was it was a creaking door it was anthony  sure it was so i i'm sneaking around the house with the shotgun like you know checking the basement  or anywhere else maybe they you know came into it through a basement window and opened the basement 
[01:53:30]  door somehow you know i'm just kind of you know going over everything checking every corner of  the house you're not kind of just checking anything when you have a shotgun well yes i was i was prepared  to kill somebody if i would have seen them in there and they perhaps weren't white i'm kidding now stop  it inappropriate i'm kidding of course if they did not belong there can i jump in for one second uh 
[01:54:00]  craig go ahead i'll be craig what's going on hello we still have to do this craig yeah all right  what's up you're starting to worry me man why well y'all do you're holding hands with danny the  match game and this morning night you're picturing anthony walking through his house black socks and  underwear well because we think he's nuts yeah everyone thinks i'm crazy yeah but the phone's still i i'm  really not and and and i i checked the house uh while toting my my 12 gauge and uh it was clear 
[01:54:30]  so i gave myself the all clear all clear all clear all clear and uh went upstairs and as i'm walking  back up the uh the stairs please tell me someone scared you and you and you shot a hole in your  no you would have loved that wouldn't you i would love the fireplace also his girlfriend comes in hey  big huge hole and here's the thing i had just called my girlfriend and she was having dinner 
[01:55:00]  so i knew that she wasn't the one that was coming home so i knew everything you know if someone's  coming through my door they don't belong in the house and i'm not a shoot first kind of guy make my  take out a kneecap but you know i'm not going to kill the guy right away i'll wait i walk up with  the shotgun over my shoulder and i could because now the house is clear so i could just kind of walk  upstairs and i hear the door it's my girlfriend's computer it has a sound prompt when she gets an email 
[01:55:30]  that makes the sound of a creaking door opening and closing and that is what i was hunting down  in my house last night please tell me you blew away the computer i turned and fired what did i need a  new dell monitor he was a little yellow man and whenever the american online came on he would run  quickly across my screen i had no hands or feet it was a little dog and he wanted to answer my questions 
[01:56:00]  with a paper clip it was a tough shot but i finally got him the talking paper clip upset me  and i had to shoot you know what's going to happen one day he's going to get broken into  and he's going to point the gun and they're going to walk up and go give me that gun and he's going  to go stay back stay back and they're going to walk up and just take it from him no i will shoot to  kill i'm protecting me and my own i i you know i'm protecting my house you realize what it was 
[01:56:30]  you just kind of returned to your post yeah i returned to my post back on my patio no i put  the uh 12 back i hadn't even racked it yet there wasn't even around in the chamber i was waiting  that's a dramatic moment nice scares everybody away but that was after i had my neighborly moment  uh young lad as i pulled up in the driveway bouncing a basketball down the street this is a lovely  suburban neighborhood i live in doing doing he's just bouncing a basketball and i get out of my 
[01:57:00]  my uh vehicle and he goes you're anthony he's about 10 or 11 or something like that i go yeah  yeah hi and he just keeps going i go what's your name he goes billy i live over there  doing doing i go well it's nice to meet you billy yeah nice to meet you doing doing doing down there  and i'm just thinking what a wonderful neighborhood this is where you could just see scenes of suburbia 
[01:57:30]  like that no problem of uh no threats of being robbed except by a computer making noises well  speaking of which on the instant feedback inbred pest a wet from a website uh you can't mention  uh she should make a sound prompt that says what are you doing so and can say i don't know can you help  me if i were her now i'd really i'd really do it her next her sound prompt should be every time 
[01:58:00]  someone walks in she'd be like all right you checked the other room every 20 minutes you're  running downstairs with your gun cocked just wearing underpants my underpants no i had to put  like and and here's what happened i knew the sound came from outside the bedroom so i could see from  my bedroom i could see down my hallway and to the staircase the top of the staircase so if anyone's  coming in i know they have to be downstairs and if they're going to threaten me at that point they  have to come up the stairs so i'm putting my pajama bottoms on with a deadlock stare at the top of the 
[01:58:30]  stairway like because i i don't want to take my eyes off of it just in case you know they rush me  but i don't want to be caught without my pants on you don't want to be found i don't want to be killed  or kill someone without my pants on because that's embarrassing either way because then you can't kill  someone and put your pants on because then it's like you know i don't know perhaps there was some 
[01:59:00]  splatter on your leg and they would be doing something where you're screwing around with evidence or  things so i but i don't want to shoot someone naked or in my underwear all right let's go to  greg and westchester greg making sense jimmy you're looking at me like i'm a psychopath perfectly normal  to happen to put your pants on before you murder somebody it's not murder if they're in my house  it's self-defense my friend to be distracting self-defense greg what's up good morning boys good  morning good morning boys great show hey anthony yeah you're searching through the house looking for 
[01:59:30]  that rascally rabbit no i wasn't hunting for a cartoon rabbit you idiot ah what's up back  there's some great phone calls coming in but uh we're having a problem with the phones today  unfortunately why can't i just protect me my castle it's a man protecting his his castle  that's what it is you guys you're a bunch of you're gonna sit you know what's gonna happen  someday jimmy's gonna order out or something or order one of these uh whores and he's gonna get

[02:02:30]  phones that does work because someone actually sent an instant feedback going hey does this work  because i'm sending from my uh mobile device yes it does work uh this one comes from 781  but it says uh anthony you won't shoot to kill you'll burst into tears you sally  no in the old days i may have a little call back from yesterday's crying segment we're too honest on  this program that's the problem protect your castle huh and how many wives have you beheaded 
[02:03:00]  i don't behead wives chip in saratoga anthony you're watching too many effing abbott and costello  meet the monsters movies oh like no like there's never been home invasions in nasa county uh new york  my friend there are there's been plenty of home invasions anthony refers to his house as a castle  but it seems more like his bunker brian from florida house bunker whatever you want to call it 
[02:03:30]  when that lad came up and said hi you're anthony you had those visions of popping out of the bunker  and seeing the young germans defending the turf you felt you know what i did i walked up to him  i patted him on the cheek and i said i wish i had a whole battalion like you looks like you needed  danny over at your castle last night to hold your hand that's damn funny if danny comes into my  neighborhood he's getting shot no he's not he's part you yeah but the other but yeah okay  yeah he might fit all right uh that's very funny if someone's just trying to flip me through the 
[02:04:00]  radio and they hear that nice part you ah what you're gonna do juke broad all right stay in age  i'm asking you to help me here henry this is the ona virus spreading across america okay here we go  hey this is brett michaels of poison and you are listening to the worst of opie and anthony i played  something even more nerdy and geeky last night this is the geekiest thing there is no real 
[02:04:30]  excitement in it there's a sense of accomplishment but it's a game where there is  and it's it's it takes about three and a half hours depending on uh what i was yeah about three  and a half jimmy get ready to look away it was the brand new microsoft flight simulator x that came out  and i flew a 737 from uh la guardia to orlando airport in real time  it took 
[02:05:00]  it took three and a half hours um and yeah i i just did that  i i i took off and well you know why because it's yeah you do it you do it the actual way it's  done you don't use anything that like you know the overhead map view to steer yourself like  to florida you have to use the gps or uh the vor uh uh radials that are on the ground things like 
[02:05:30]  that and you you you actually use the instruments that are on real planes the autopilot and then you  crank it up you know 35 000 feet and and the graphics are great so it looks really cool and  then uh you figure out how everything works it's uh amazing and then when you come in for landing  that's the uh that's the tricky part that's what they say that's the tricky part you do know that  but shock jocks it was the geek it really was stupid i'm sitting there and three and a half hours 
[02:06:00]  later i'm like all right i'm ready to land did you have a sense of accomplishment um yeah yeah even  though i hit the runway a little to the right of the runway isn't it true though that most of that  time you're doing nothing doing absolutely nothing just kind of looking at the instruments the autopilot  really takes care of everything you're just dialing in altitudes and headings and uh then you hit the  command and boom the plane you think that you could fly a plane tomorrow i think i could i could fly a 
[02:06:30]  plane like i think i could fly an airline commercial airline i know where everything is i know what  everything does there is a feel that you need to the whole thing landing would be very difficult and  you've never flown a plane before you've just done these i flew a cessna oh you did years ago like i  took one of the um did you take off and land or were you no no no or were you like it was all right  time to take the wheel it was a ride yeah it was one of those and you take the wheel and kind of do  and that was before flight simulators but uh yeah you know once you know all the instrumentation and how 
[02:07:00]  it works uh it's just the feel of it and uh landing is a whole nother animal that's there's a lot  involved in that yeah is there yeah but it was it was why wouldn't you hit something on purpose why  would you do that right um why wouldn't you pitch it right to the airport you'd do it a couple of times  as a matter of fact i i tried pulling that yankee left turn into the building oh really yeah with a  a side wind coming and it is very hard to make that turn uh with the of course 25 mile an hour 
[02:07:30]  what do you get out of this it's actually uh you you learn a little something about aviation  uh the graphics are great so you can look at um places and landmarks and stuff like that all over  the globe there's 25 000 airports all around the world that are really detailed there's air traffic  control air traffic ground traffic uh so you got to interact with air traffic control uh there there  are missions where you actually have to uh obey air traffic control and go to their the the proper 
[02:08:00]  altitudes for uh for the direction you're flying in and things like that and it's uh it's interesting  does it look like the skies in front of you yeah it looks really cool like the clouds and the weather  you can actually set it for real-time weather so it checks the weather on the internet and wherever  you're flying that's the weather that you'll get so if you like i took off last night um uh and it  was raining because it was raining here at night yeah but then it was you couldn't see me i know it's 
[02:08:30]  dark well it it's but i wanted to do it real time you could see like the light very pretty and you know  the moon was full how do you look out the side window uh they got a little view thing on the uh on  the stick you get a little um it's called a hat switch and it could turn turn around you can look  at any portion of the uh flight deck and uh switches and knobs galore for everything so you know where  everything is you need a good gaming card uh yeah definitely you really need a top-notch computer or 
[02:09:00]  this thing i'll just and people are really really into this they like in their uh their hours up on  this get their hours up there are uh on you you i can actually uh join an a virtual you can make a  virtual airline online that you then have to carry out a certain schedule and keep the schedule and  there are other people online you could uh fly in formation on these uh uh with stunt planes with 
[02:09:30]  other people online there's everything from helicopters to commercial jets to stunt planes  small cessnas ew it's but you learn about aviation yeah it's wonderful watch this  hey chess book i'm not saying chess chess book an eight-year-old online chess play whoa what kind  of graphics card you need for a a rook i said for like five minutes i got into it  no offense it does give you a feeling i'm getting beat up because there's a bunch of listeners out 
[02:10:00]  there that do exactly what you were doing last night i just don't get it on any level whatsoever  you got to be kind of a computer geek and an aviation geek like i love aviation yeah i love the  whole so why don't you just go for real and start uh flying less uh because i don't want to end up  inside of a building yeah i don't know it's just kind of it's a little it's a little iffy i'd rather  leave it to the pros let's go to scott in new mexico scott can i ask a question uh yes uh scott 
[02:10:30]  uh i got your beat i've flown that thing from kennedy to hong kong before it takes about 14 hours to get  it done if you go to if you go to flight sim.com i know you're not allowed to promote them but you  can download everything from fighter jets to world war ii oh yeah the aircraft i mean there's all kinds  yeah there are people i understand there's a community that's really into this but uh scott  you do this in real time isn't there a fast forward like uh there is how do you not hit the  fast forward just to get a couple hours done knowing knowing for a couple hours you're going 
[02:11:00]  to do absolutely nothing you can accelerate it but the problem is is if you get too many aircraft  commands it'll it'll cut you off your flight plan and then it won't get any more commands see if you  go too fast it's not just a straight line you know when you're when you're in a passenger plane  you're not just flying straight especially in weather and stuff like that you got to listen  to the air traffic controllers you got to adjust things like that so that's what uh the why you  don't fast forward you can fast forward though can you start upside down the plane yes you can  i'd fly upside down have a fun flight for everybody yeah why not upside down airlines yes scott 
[02:11:30]  if you flip the gps switch on the dash of the aircraft if you flip the gps switch you don't even  have to enter command it'll fly your flight plan whether it's an ifr plan or a gps  direct route yeah yeah the gps really takes any work out of it you got to use the vor's all right  hey thank you scott that makes a little more fun there's a ton of people calling in they're into  this how are we going to be number one in chicago talking about this crap because this is top of the  line stuff do you know that microsoft flight simulator has been one of the best selling games 
[02:12:00]  since it came out in like the the early to mid 80s when it really sucked it was pretty much a line  for the horizon and you had like one gauge yeah and and uh the refresh rate for the screen was like  you got one frame every five seconds it was pretty much it and i picked that up and was thrilled with  it i thought it was amazing uh now this one it's the new one that just came out it's a flight simulator  x and uh it looks amazing and and the realism uh everything from you're at the terminal you know 
[02:12:30]  you got to make sure you get the proper um clearance and radio frequencies for pushback you got to  actually dial in the right radio frequencies for the pushback taxi and then uh departure and then  they hand you off uh to the different uh flight air traffic controllers and then approach runway  uh you could just sit on the runway no but what if you don't want to do anything but just fly just 
[02:13:00]  fly you want to just back out and fly you could do that too you could just yeah you could just take  off when do you get fighter jets like telling you to to land the plane can you get that done i don't  know they ought to put that in though that's the stuff i would like the experiment i just got it  yesterday actually flying you know from from new york to orlando boring i would like do all sorts of  things to see what see what this game could do i just got the new one yesterday yeah all right it's pretty  similar to the previous one but it looks a little better you should fly straight up in the air and 
[02:13:30]  not come down just see what happens like keep going up straight uh you will wing over and come down  yeah all right listen and just swing over and shut your engines off listen i've done that i've shut  the engines off could you see the plummeting interesting yeah wow we plummeting we could uh talk  about this all morning of course we could but let's talk chess and then we'll watch whoopee just go  right past us in the ratings here in new york no i don't sit and wear a captain hat in front of  my computer you probably do the captain's hat you probably do dork oh my god he makes believe he 
[02:14:00]  used to fly in vietnam i i sit in my office with the door locked and my girlfriend has to have a  special knock to come in so i know it's not terrorist but you have a little peephole you put in the door  yes  no i don't  let's uh let's take a break we got lots to do still all right it's the ona virus spreading across america  the opium anthony show
