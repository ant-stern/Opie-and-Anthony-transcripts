<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in their characteristically vulgar humor, noting the absence of E-Rock, who was at a food and wine show.  The conversation quickly turned to a recent slashing spree in Opie's neighborhood, perpetrated by a homeless Texan, sparking a discussion about the mental health system and its perceived failures. A caller, Jimmy, experienced technical difficulties.  The hosts then criticized Mayor De Blasio's policies, reminisced about a "grittier" New York City, and shared anecdotes about neighbors' reactions to the slashing incident.

A substantial portion of the show dissected a Chevrolet commercial featuring the words "crazy" and "insane," which had upset Fez from the Ron and Fez show.  The hosts played the commercial and analyzed Fez's reaction, contrasting it with Ron's perspective. They played clips from Ron and Fez, highlighting Fez’s extensive, rambling critique,  speculating on a potential link between Fez's reaction and a past incident involving Troy Quant, and suggesting Sam Roberts’ intentional manipulation of the situation for comedic effect. This led to a discussion of Sam Roberts' alleged manipulative behavior and Fez's perceived paranoia.

The show then transitioned into the recurring "Jocktober" segment, highlighting bad radio moments.  They discussed a particularly poor "fugitive" bit from a Canadian radio station and previewed their upcoming Jocktober segment featuring criticism of an Atlanta radio show, "Star 94's Cindy and Jimmy in the morning."  They also previewed their upcoming guest, Paul Williams, playing a portion of his song, "An Old Fashioned Love Song," and comparing it to a Three Dog Night cover.

The music-themed segment that followed involved playing various songs by artists such as Three Dog Night, Sting, and Aldo Nova. The hosts discussed Sting's "loot" project, a negative encounter Opie had with Sting, and extensively mocked Aldo Nova's 80s music videos. They analyzed Great White's Led Zeppelin cover, focusing on the vocalist's range and the band's fire incident, and spent considerable time trying to identify a woman from a Great White music video.  They also discussed Paul Simon's performance of "You Could Call Me Al," and called Paul Williams, revealing he didn't play keyboard despite one being set up.  The segment concluded with discussions of the US government shutdown, a motorcycle chase, and the video game Grand Theft Auto.

A segment heavily featuring a viral video of a Range Rover versus motorcyclists' confrontation followed, with hosts and callers debating fault amidst profanity and racial slurs.  "Jocktober" continued with a detailed, derogatory critique of "Star 94's Cindy and Jimmy in the morning,"  including playing audio clips and analyzing sexually suggestive photos from their Facebook page, ultimately leading to the page's takedown.  A caller with 20 years of motorcycle experience contributed to the discussion.  Paul Williams' upcoming appearance was briefly mentioned again.

The show included a segment about a woman's DUI arrest, followed by a "gross foods" phone topic with callers Amanda (chicken on the bone) and Carla (boiled okra).

The Paul Williams interview covered his career, substance abuse recovery, work with various artists (Three Dog Night, Daft Punk, the Muppets), anecdotes with Burt Reynolds and Johnny Carson, his documentary *I Am Paul Williams*, and his book *Gratitude and Trust Recovery Is Not Just for Addicts*.  The hosts and Williams exchanged jokes, and Williams' sobriety was highlighted.

The show concluded with Jim Norton's advice segment.  The Opie and Anthony podcast episode 21 was promoted, featuring a "wheelchair Fred bit," a "dildo in the bathtub bit," James Caan stories, and Brother Joe's guitar performance.  Paul Williams' sobriety was mentioned again.  Callers discussed various relationship issues, including spanking, infidelity, cuckolding, defecation during sex, and compulsive lying.  Norton provided advice, suggesting therapy and 12-step programs where appropriate. A call about incest porn was cut short.  Norton concluded by promoting his shows.

The show is twisted.  I'm telling you,  who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, 
[00:04:30]  it would say,  die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear  is real.  Bring this over.  Clean it hard.  Clean it hard.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  The whole gang's back together today.  Well, not the whole gang.  We don't have E-Rock.  Where's E-Rock?  He's out, you know,  until further notice, I guess.  He's at some kind of food show.  He's at the wine.  The wine and food show.  Food show.  Down there in Disney.  Epcot.  Oh, Epcot, Disney, whatever the fuck. 
[00:05:30]  Same place, right?  Same thing.  Weren't we going to call him or something?  I tried calling him.  You did.  But he's on to us.  It went right to voicemail.  Sucks.  I hate when they're on to us.  Fucking crazy ass motherfuckers.  All right.  Good morning, everybody.  Nah, there's a fucking slashing thing in my neighborhood yesterday.  We were just talking about this.  We were talking about crazy people.  Yeah.  And they're a nuisance.  They really are.  I worry more about crazy people without guns than people with guns. 
[00:06:00]  Period.  There's a mental issue that's going down in this country.  Yeah.  Way crazier than some dude with a fucking gun.  Well, the real crazy people rarely get guns.  The truth of the matter is.  Yeah, but they do really well with bricks.  Pipes.  Scissors.  This guy had half a scissor.  Yeah.  Or the old pusheroo.  They're really good.  Yeah, the old shoverific right into the fucking subway. 
[00:06:30]  They're really fucking good.  But right in my neighborhood, man.  Really close.  A park that I've been to many, many times with my children.  Oh, yeah?  You got a homeless guy who's from Texas originally.  And he went on a slashing spree.  What a fucking asshole.  And this park, Riverside Drive Park.  Yeah.  It used to be a fun place to go.  And they made it really fucking nice under the West Side Highway.  It goes for blocks.  Like 20, 30 blocks. 
[00:07:00]  My family, we stopped going there because we noticed that more and more homeless people are using it to fucking crash.  Fucking dangerous.  And they used to have patrols.  But, you know, Bloomberg was worried about fucking sodas and shit.  So, we had to, like, lose the patrols down there.  They couldn't fund the patrols anymore.  They put the patrols there after that fucking lopper guy was cutting people's fucking heads off down the West Side.  It was like, how long ago was that? 
[00:07:30]  I'm not even going to fucking make believe.  All right.  What?  That's a Seinfeld reference.  What?  Do you know how I knew it was a Seinfeld reference?  Because when you were telling that story, I could hear dumb Travis going, the lopper?  Yeah.  The lopper?  And I'm like, there's no way he knows anything current.  The lopper?  It's on the West Side.  We're on to you, sir.  It's on the West Side.  But, uh, they used to have, like, you know, these assholes on bikes and stuff, patrol it.  Yeah.  Which I didn't really, they were a pain in the ass because they were such, you know, dicks.  Didn't they make you stop riding your bike on fucking somewhere? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, I got a ticket.  Yeah.  I got a ticket for a couple hundred dollars because I was on my bike.  How much a ticket is for that?  Something like that.  On a path or something.  Jeez.  But anyway, this guy, you know, homeless fucking guy from Texas, all of a sudden decided he  really needed to slash people yesterday.  Jesus Christ.  And he got a kid?  Well, he started with, I think he started with a jogger.  Just a lady jogging.  Just a lady jogging and he takes the half a scissor right to her back. 
[00:08:30]  That's how it started.  Then he slashed three more people, including a two-year-old.  He got a father fighting off the attacker to protect his own fucking two-year-old.  See, if he would have fucking been an armed citizen.  That is true.  Could have just pulled out the gun and fucking dispatched that guy.  We wouldn't have to hear from him anymore.  But if he was armed, he would have shot the people instead of slashing them.  Oh, no, not him.  And then they hold the fucking guy for police.  You know what?  You got to do the right thing and take his life. 
[00:09:00]  Kill him.  What good is this fucking crazy lunatic?  Snap his neck and say, look, I was holding him down.  He was trying to get up and I just heard a pop.  Right.  And then you fast forward a couple of years.  We'll be on it.  This guy will be out there again because some asshole will go, you know, it was the medication.  We figured it out.  And now he's good now.  He's good now.  Yeah.  And he'll be out there eventually.  Yeah.  We got the right meds for him.  So we're just going to send him out now.  Not fucking monitor if he's taking them. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  So when he stops, he'll kill somebody.  I'm so fucking tired of it.  People just minding their own fucking business.  And this guy decides for whatever fucking reason.  What?  Did he hear voices?  What was it?  Oh, it's always the voices.  What was it this time?  Oh, it's always the voices.  Fuck.  Jimmy in New York City.  Yes, Hope.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you?  Good, good.  Jimmy, what's up?  All right.  Hello.  Let's go. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, what was that?  Sorry.  That was a keyboard that I don't give a shit about.  Oh, good.  What do you got, Jimmy?  You work at the psych hospital?  Yeah, my phone's fucked up.  I'll call you later.  All right.  All right.  Call us later.  I like that guy, though.  I like that guy.  He knew his phone stunk.  Give us a jingle.  But these fucking crazy people, you see them walking around all the time.  You just wonder which one is going to fucking explode.  Which one will snap.  Which one's going to snap? 
[00:10:30]  You see them wander around like zombies.  I've just had it with them.  I've had it with them.  The authorities are powerless to do anything because then these groups come in and say,  you can't fucking do that.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Why not?  And then forget about it once de Blasio gets in.  Holy shit.  He's literally a communist.  Yeah.  And he doesn't give a flying fuck about it.  He'd love New York City to look like Havana.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  I can't wait, though.  Burnt out buildings in the Bronx again, maybe.  Cars on the West Side Highway.  Abandoned vehicles all over the West Side Highway.  Prostitutes back.  Squeegee guys.  I like a little fucking grit.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's fun as long as you're not living in the city.  Yeah.  It was fun to visit it growing up.  All dirty.  It was completely different than what it is today, as most of us know now.  Everyone walking around with a big afro like his son.  The afro's coming back.  I know.  The Oscar Gamble afro is coming back. 
[00:11:30]  I fucking was way ahead of my time.  I saw two brothers sporting the Oscar Gamble in the last week alone.  The big-ass fucking Natru?  With the hat.  That's why I'm calling it the Oscar Gamble.  The famous Oscar Gamble picture.  Just Google image Oscar Gamble.  You'll see him in his Yankees cap.  I saw two of those in the last week.  Huge afros with a fucking hat on.  Wow.  He does have a big afro there.  How is that hat on his head? 
[00:12:00]  I don't know.  You've got to think he pinned it down, right?  I don't know.  There's no way that hat would have stayed on.  I'd like to see what it looks like right when he takes it off.  It's probably an invisible hat on his head.  I bet that hair don't move.  So my neighborhood was abuzz yesterday with this slasher dude.  People very mad because it happened in their neighborhood.  It's just kind of a well-to-do area up there.  What happened?  Well, then you get the assholes going, 
[00:12:30]  this shouldn't be happening in our neighborhood.  They always say, you know, this doesn't happen around here.  You've got to hear that nonsense.  And then you've got to hear the people that just want to, like,  you know, bring you down.  Man, so many people that work in my building, did you hear?  A kid got slashed down there.  Like, there's people that they can't wait to deliver the bad news.  They're fucking bad news junkies.  They love it, dude.  They're junkies, right?  They love it.  And they don't. 
[00:13:00]  What happened?  Kenny.  Isn't Kenny one of those?  Oh, yeah, he is.  He certainly is.  Kenny makes the bad news happen and then tells you.  And then tells you.  Somebody got their legs broken.  What happened?  I broke them.  Yeah, some people just love that.  Hey, did you hear?  And I'm like, and one guy said, hey, did I go?  Yes, I heard.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  All of us with small children are fucking freaking out today.  Yes.  Is that the reaction you want from me? 
[00:13:30]  So here it is.  Thank you.  How do you stand there and watch some guy stabbing your fucking two-year-old?  I'm sure the other's fighting, right?  Shit.  It was more of a slashing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The two-year-old is fine.  Everyone's okay.  A couple of people are in critical condition, but they're going to be all right.  Yeah.  But you know what?  People help out.  I mean, people were on it, man.  They were on it.  Could have been a lot worse.  Should have pounced on them.  Well, I read the story and they're like, and one man, you know, held them until the cops 
[00:14:00]  got there.  I'm like, no, that ain't happening.  At least fucking throw some elbows on when he's down there.  Tune them up a little bit.  Oh, fuck.  Right on his throat.  How could you not just bash his brains in with a fucking brick?  Like, how is that illegal if he's slashing a child?  How is it not legal just to bash his brains in with a rock?  At that moment, you can.  But if you pin him down and subdue him, then you can't.  Right.  So it's better to just kill him right away when he's fucking doing shit like that.  You're like, oh, and then you throw him on the ground and crush his windpipe. 
[00:14:30]  Sure.  Go, hey, he fell.  And I fucking, you know, the way I fell on top of him.  What are you going to do?  Well, you know, most crazies, most crazies keep it between the lines.  We know that.  Although, you know, they're me, me, me shit kind of.  And they're all crazy.  So it's very difficult to know if they're going to keep it.  But you just walk around the city, you know which ones are potentially a major problem.  A little volatile.  There's a guy I will, I don't know why I haven't videotaped him yet.  But he, he, he, his pants are half fucking down every day. 
[00:15:00]  And he bends over to fucking pick up shit.  But he's wearing, any young black guy, that's what that is.  He's Hispanic, actually.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  And he, you know, he's, he's always digging through the trash.  He's wearing basically rags and his pants are halfway down.  And the neighborhood, I guess, has just decided to let this be.  Or maybe they've called the cops, but the cops are like, I don't know.  There's nothing we can really do about this.  In New York, there's other things to worry about.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like, fuck it. 
[00:15:30]  But don't you think eventually that guy could be an issue?  Absolutely.  You're walking around with your pants half down, fucking bending over, looking for like a half a burger in a fucking garbage pail.  You should stand behind him and just start jerking off.  And that would fucking stop him.  Well, then you would be the problem.  Yeah, the fucking city's full of those kooks.  Yeah, it's just, that one was close to home yesterday, though, of course.  Of course.  Horrifying.  Yeah, it is horrifying. 
[00:16:00]  Fucking horrifying.  It's ridiculous.  I don't go down there much, man.  I know that little area you mean it's nice down the water.  They put it together all nice.  But like I said, you know, all the homeless, especially at night, they need places to sleep.  So the word got out, you know?  Hmm.  A lot of bushy areas and, you know, tall grass growing.  And it's perfect for a homeless dude to fucking lay down at night.  And then look at the stars over the Hudson River.  Nice view.  Although I'm sure they see something else when they look up in the sky. 
[00:16:30]  Of course.  They see big faces that are telling them to hurt people.  Right.  They see the face of their mother and father or whatever uncle hit them.  Yes.  Fuck.  You have to go out to win my love.  You must kill people.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck.  Yes, mommy.  It's grace.  Yes, daddy.  I'll do some slashing tomorrow.  It makes perfect sense to them.  Yeah.  Always.  No way so.  That's great, great. 
[00:17:00]  I thought we were going to have Chris Matthews in today.  Bumming.  He was here yesterday.  Saw him yesterday in the fishbowl.  Nick DiPaolo was yelling and screaming.  We were walking out with Nick DiPaolo yesterday, who was fucking fun as fuck on the show yesterday.  Yeah, he was fun.  Yeah, I guess he's at Caroline's tonight.  Every Wednesday in October.  So go see Nick down there.  Every Wednesday he's doing it.  Yeah.  He's working some shit out.  Oh, wow.  That's a great idea.  Yeah.  So we were walking out and Chris Matthews, he was in the fishbowl. 
[00:17:30]  Doing like a town hall or something.  Doing a town hall with a bunch of people.  But he was reading from his book.  He was reading.  Nothing worse than sitting there as the guy who wrote the book, allegedly.  Yeah, yeah.  Most people don't even write their books anymore.  I'm sure Chris Matthews had a hand in his.  But in general, these dummies don't write their own books.  No.  And then they sit there and just read passages from their books.  Why would that be fun?  You're not interested in seeing that?  That's what I realized.  So he was in the fishbowl and, you know, it's soundproof. 
[00:18:00]  So from outside you can't hear if you're in there.  But there were a lot of people outside the fishbowl gathered around looking in, watching him.  And we walk out and Nick is like, oh, there's that fucking asshole, Chris Matthews.  What a cocksucker.  Fuck this cocksucker.  Everyone starts laughing.  He said fucking liberal and all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  That fucking liberal cocksucker.  Look at that fucking idiot.  It was Bob Grant sitting in there. 
[00:18:30]  I'm like.  Everybody was just.  You know how sensitive they could be around here, though.  So I was a little worried for Nick.  Oh, it was great.  It was funny as all.  Good for Nick.  Yeah, good for him is right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was fucking really funny yesterday.  Every comic and impressionist he was bringing up saying, oh, yeah, I used to see that guy.  He was hilarious.  And then fucking Sam would pop up a clip and it was the worst.  He's like, oh, fuck, you're finding.  Oh, you keep finding clips where they suck.  Fred Travelina and John Beiner. 
[00:19:00]  I don't know what Fred does.  I know his name.  Apparently horrible impressions and singing.  Wow.  Fred Travelina and John Beiner.  I did Leno yesterday.  He mentioned both of those guys while we were talking.  Wow, that's fucked up.  I talked about Rich Little.  He goes, hey, you know, Fred Travelina and Beiner.  He did good impressions.  Wow.  That's weird.  Weird, funny stuff.  Look, I just did an impression.  Ah, shit.  Sam Roberts, the instigator.  Idiots still think we start at 6 a.m. 
[00:19:30]  and they have a problem when we start after 6.  Go fuck yourselves.  Fucking idiots.  We don't even know when the show starts.  What do you do?  Get right to the job and fucking get right to work?  Or maybe you pour yourself a cup of coffee.  But that's what they complain about.  Fucking check your Twitter and everything.  That's what they're complaining about.  That's it.  Aaaaaaah!  Holy shit. 
[00:20:00]  Are you kidding me?  I hope somebody's alarm just went on and was set to this station when you did that.  I don't understand the mindset of a person that is freaked out because a radio show is starting  a little after 6.  Fuck, 6.15, 6.20 some days, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then some days we go to 10.30.  Yeah, that's what happens.  Like yesterday.  But you're so bothered that you have to reach out to us about it?  Of course they do.  Did the guy write something on Twitter that was annoying? 
[00:20:30]  No, not even annoying, really.  That was a mouse.  I use the word a lot.  It's mind-boggling what people just get all uptight about.  Fuck, you're wasting time.  This life thing goes by really fast.  You're going to waste it fucking worrying about dumb shit like that?  What am I going to do?  Go entertain yourself for a while until we start.  Start there.  I'm on a blocking spree, by the way, without even replying. 
[00:21:00]  Because I used to reply at first, or I used to direct message somebody and be like,  Hey, with your three followers, I'm double.  But now I just like at the drop of a fucking hat, I'm blocking people.  I don't care who they are, how long they listen, if they have a wow fucking tag in their picture.  Fuck it.  All that shit.  Don't care.  Right.  Block-a-roonie.  Don't give a shit.  And for nothing sometimes. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, Anthony, nice fucking something.  Boom!  Goodbye.  Don't need it anymore.  Don't need ya.  It feels good.  It does.  It feels good to block.  And then they write, a lot of times they write, could you unblock?  And I've done it a couple times.  Some have been cool, but a couple of these scumbags are right back to being cunts.  I'm like, why did I ever unblock them?  No fucking reprieves.  I give no one a reprieve from fucking blocking.  I've done.  It doesn't.  No.  I've done the reprieve.  I don't care anymore. 
[00:22:00]  It's worked out very well, actually.  Don't even care.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  We've been doing this long enough to know, like, the haters.  You so know the difference.  It's very easy.  I mean, fuck, I've been doing this, you know, God, 30 years.  Oh, my God.  I've been doing this 30 years.  I know if you hate me.  I'm not stupid.  You know what I mean?  I know the fucking difference.  I don't want to fucking take the time.  I don't want to waste the time trying to interpret what somebody meant.  I used to check their timeline a little bit and see if they goof around with us a little 
[00:22:30]  and be like, all right, what he said, it's like on the border, pissing me off.  But he seems to have been a fan.  I don't have time for that anymore.  I don't care.  Boof!  Boof!  I have a young cat at home.  I don't have time for this anymore.  Speaking of crazy.  Yeah.  People need their update.  Crazy.  Crazy, crazy for being. 
[00:23:00]  Let me do this first, though.  What?  Let me do this first.  Ooh, he's warming his hands up.  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-T. 
[00:23:30]  Host.  Holes.  Bits.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for...  Jocktober.  I got a tree on my house.  Day two of Jocktober.  Yeah.  Wow.  Damn, it certainly is.  I like this music.  It's wacky.  And we have another bonus Jocktober.  That's right, we do.  It's an update, I guess, right?  This isn't the actual Jocktober for today.  No.  It's an update on yesterday's Jocktober. 
[00:24:00]  How was it?  I didn't hear it.  Oh.  Sam just infuriated myself and certainly Anthony.  Yeah.  He brought a fugitive.  Fucking...  The first Jocktober.  The first fucking day he brings the fugitive bit that some radio station in Canada is doing.  It just starts with some fucking chick going like, somebody stole $10,000 from...  We're like, no!  No!  Was it good, the Bits?  Oh, it was terrible.  It was a new level of low. 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  They did it the worst.  Yeah, it was the worst fugitive bit I'd ever heard.  My favorite part of it, though, was how they shoehorned in the sponsor.  Yeah, the PETA pit or something.  The PETA...  The fugitive eats healthy.  The fugitive thinks fresh and eats healthy at PETA pit.  Ew!  Yes!  I don't believe you.  I swear to you they did.  The fugitive thinks healthy?  Thinks...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't believe that.  It was so ham-handed the way they...  It's unbelievable.  ...threw in that fucking plug. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, they kept doing it.  Well, today we got to update Jim Norton.  We have the actual Jocktober for today.  We'll do a little later.  That's later, yeah.  But we have to do a fez update.  Best not be a fugitive.  I'll say that.  Fez?  Why Fez?  It's a fez update.  Oh.  Today's main Jocktober.  Yeah.  Not a fugitive.  We're going regular Jocktober today.  I think everybody can take a deep breath.  Before we lose the whole audience.  That's what we want.  But yeah, bonus Jocktober is... 
[00:25:30]  Oh, one guy wrote,  Oh, it's Jocktober.  Time to tune out Opie and Anthony for a month.  I'll see you November 1st.  Fucking bye.  That's what I wrote.  I go, bye.  Oh, do I fucking love it.  Because these idiots,  some of the material we choose to talk about  might be lame when, you know, on the surface,  but the jokes are always there.  Oh, my God.  I take pride in the fact that this radio show,  the jokes are always there.  So an idiot like that just going, bye. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, no matter what you could say  about yesterday's stupid fugitive heavy fucking Jocktober,  Nick DiPaolo is hilarious.  Yeah, the jokes were there, period.  We were all having a good time and laughing.  I wish I could find the actual tweet.  He's like, oh, see you in November.  Bye.  See you.  Especially because we all start getting flooded with tweets  in like August saying,  It's only a month and a half till Jocktober.  And there's got to be one douchebag.  No, there's more than one douchebag.  Gad. 
[00:26:30]  It's so just ridiculous.  Yes.  Well, apparently yesterday got a lot of heat  when we talked about Fez.  Fez on the Ron and Fez show.  Fez was upset that a commercial used the word crazy.  Have you seen the commercial yet, Jimmy?  And insane in the commercial.  I have not.  So we should play it for you really fast.  Yeah, I have not heard it.  Yeah.  We were all stupefied by this one from Fez,  to be honest with you.  He couldn't fathom that people weren't upset  and offended by the use of the word crazy. 
[00:27:00]  And to Ron's credit,  he just, he didn't, he didn't know what to say.  Ronnie instantly.  Ronnie almost didn't know what to say for the first time.  He said, you're nuts.  Yeah.  He couldn't believe that this is the cause  that Fez has taken up.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  And it's no joke.  This is real.  Oh, no, I imagine he is real.  The Chevy Cruze offers an EPA estimated 36 MPG highway.  Sam brought this to our attention, by the way.  Crazy.  Crazy efficient.  Ten standard airbags.  And you get Stabilitrack with traction control.  That is like crazy protection. 
[00:27:30]  This interior is insane.  It is insane.  I was going to say crazy again.  Visit your local Chevy dealer.  That's pretty much it.  That is it.  And he thinks that's just,  we shouldn't be throwing that word around lightly.  Especially corporate America  shouldn't be throwing that word around lightly.  In fairness, you know, it's insensitive.  It's very insensitive.  I fucking hate you. 
[00:28:00]  Ronnie had a great angle on it.  He goes, people that,  when you have words like retarded  and fucking, what's another?  Fans of ours.  Queer.  Gay.  Nigger.  You know.  They, it's.  I have to throw that out there.  He just wanted to.  He's like, oh, I got a chance to say it.  He wanted to say that one first.  Of course I did.  I could.  Let me.  Let me pad it.  His father just called him.  Let me pad it before I say what I really want to say. 
[00:28:30]  You have to pad it.  I'm kidding.  You have to pad it.  You think Reed Twight was padding?  Oh, all that was.  Absolutely.  He couldn't wait to get to the word.  He couldn't wait.  But, but all those things that Ronnie had a great point.  He says, uh, like people that are called those words and want them eliminated.  They are proud of, of who they are.  Yeah.  And they don't want to be called a certain thing.  He goes, but crazy and insane people.  They're not proud that they're crazy and insane. 
[00:29:00]  So they don't have like this thing like, oh, you're misusing the word or calling us that.  We're, we're crazy Americans.  It was a really a great, uh, great point.  And, and then, uh, as, as, as Fez addressed it, he didn't acknowledge it at all.  It went right to reiterate.  Well, he doesn't really, there's a, there's times where he doesn't listen to the advice  Ronnie.  No, Ronnie was giving your eyes are spinning around in your head.  Ronnie makes some great points.  And Fez at times, I would have to say, uh, doesn't really hear Ron.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Which is, which is amazing to me.  He's just waiting for Ron to stop talking.  Yeah.  And I think the Chevrolet commercial should have went further.  We said it yesterday.  Have a crazy guy in the backseat after all that, after they use the word crazy a bunch  of times, then you, then you go to the backseat and there's a guy in a fucking straight jacket.  I probably would have ran out and bought a Chevrolet if they did that.  Right?  Exactly.  It'd be funny.  The old days, they would have done that.  Sure.  Not anymore.  Cause we are kind of sensitive douchebags now, but.  Mm.  Mm.  So anyway, Fez went off and then when Fez was making his argument, he used the word 
[00:30:00]  insane.  Yeah.  As he was.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which fucking.  His quote was.  Blows up his whole point.  Blows his quote there.  He goes, if they had used the word retarded in that commercial, people would have gone insane.  Right.  Yeah.  It was like, well, you just said people would have gone insane.  Right.  Proving how much in the, just the regular vernacular.  Right.  Of course.  Yes.  Yeah.  I tell you, you didn't like the word vernacular.  I never said that.  You destroyed me for saying vernacular.  You, you, you're dumb. 
[00:30:30]  I'm supposed to say smart things.  You're dumb.  Ah.  Ah, geez.  So, so it was a whole thing on our show.  And then I guess everyone couldn't wait to listen to Ron and Fez yesterday.  If you remember.  And then Fez, I guess Fez wants all words banned because.  Oh, everything.  You know.  Why?  I think that's his cause.  He wants all words banned.  Oh, so he can get, he just wants to get behind that? 
[00:31:00]  Think, think about it.  Oh, if every word is banned.  Think about it.  Oh.  Think about it.  That's a thinking dance joke.  That's perfect.  I'm there.  You get it?  Every single word gets banned.  There you go.  Well, he's sort of doing that already.  Right.  Yeah.  Is the, you know.  Yeah.  I'll say this about Fez.  That's why he's not talking much because he wants every word banned.  See, it's not as fun if you say it that way.  Yes, Jimmy.  I think Fez is, you know, he's, he's kind of, he's kind of, I guess, he came out of the 
[00:31:30]  closet.  He's had a big couple of years, but you can't get bogged down in language, in the fucking  language.  Like, I know what he's, he's just trying to, I guess, make things that he feels are wrong,  right?  Uh-huh.  You don't want to get caught up in the, the little nitpicky stuff that you as a radio guy  hate because that's not where the fucking battle is won.  Like, you don't win people by saying, don't use crazy in a commercial when you know that  the intent is not to be horrible. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  You know, it's like he should be fighting other battles because he's trying to, you know.  Right.  He's trying to find his way, right?  Yeah, he doesn't want to hear people yelling faggot.  And I understand that.  Like, he's probably, it probably always bothered him, but now he feels like he can speak up  and he doesn't have to be quiet about it.  But it's like, still, even though you can speak up, you shouldn't harp on that.  Right.  Because you're not going to win anything from that.  Well, the Ron and Fez show is very interesting.  It took Fez two hours to talk.  Oh, right.  About the situation.  Which is brilliant on Fez's part because, man, you know, they,  they ate up quarter hours yesterday. 
[00:32:30]  We were just explaining the eating up of quarter hours thing the other day.  Yep.  On regular radio, that was your goal, to eat up those quarter hours.  Meaning, keeping those people tuned to the fucking show.  I was tuned in.  By teasing shit.  I got home and immediately turned on the Ron and Fez show in my house.  And you guys said, who would Fez be upset with?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because this whole, because we talked about the commercial on the air.  We brought the clips. 
[00:33:00]  And you said, who do you think Fez is going to be upset with?  Yes.  And it was.  What did I say?  Right on the money.  Sam Roberts said he would be upset.  Nice.  Be upset with Sam Roberts.  Nice.  Particularly with me, because he's not going to.  But he also had a little scenario as to why you did this.  Well, we got the clips.  Oh, it's brilliant.  We got the clips.  I loved it.  I just want to point out one of the things Ronnie does very well.  Yeah.  Dare I say it's brilliant. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  When we have some info that we want to do on our show, we do it at 6.02.  We can't wait.  Can't wait.  We suck.  We start babbling right away.  You say he has Art Bell skills.  Ronnie sits back and he goes, hey, I know I have a bigger audience today because people want to know what's going on after the Opie and Anthony show.  And he just sits back in his fucking chair and takes it all in and he's all about, I'll get to it eventually.  Oh, yeah.  We have to babble right off the bat about it. 
[00:34:00]  Do you think we panic and just start?  We can't wait.  We fucking regurgitate the information immediately.  Ronnie's talking college football for a little while.  I'll get there.  Fucking amazing.  The pacing that that man has is wonderful.  It's a true fucking gift.  Just sitting back like that.  And he knew.  And two hours in, it all went down.  Yep.  Because he finally spoke up.  Was he there the whole time?  No.  Well, he was, but then he left for a while. 
[00:34:30]  Do we have that part?  I don't know if they referenced him leaving, but we do have the clip of Ron asking him about leaving.  Why he left.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, so you could just leave a radio show?  Well, Ronnie didn't like that much.  No.  You could just leave?  That would rule.  And by the way, throughout the two hours of Fez not talking, there were people calling in saying, where's Fez today?  Right.  And Ron just said, well, he's here.  He's having an off day.  And then he would just move on to college football or whatever else. 
[00:35:00]  So Fez finally spoke up yesterday on the show about the whole crazy controversy that maybe we pushed a little forward.  It started on Ron's show.  Yeah.  We just got the clips because we couldn't believe it.  We couldn't believe this is the cause he wanted to take up.  Any radio show that we caught wind was doing this, we would play the clips, especially on this platform, especially on this channel.  Right.  Yeah.  Of course.  So Fez finally spoke.  Fez, you haven't said a word.  Yes, it is. 
[00:35:30]  And it is almost 1 o'clock and you ran off to the bathroom, I guess, to either shit or throw up?  Mm-hmm.  Which one?  Throw up.  What are you upset about?  Just Sam's attack on me today on the O&A show.  Why would that make you throw up?  Just because I'm upset.  It's putting it under the guise of Jocktober, but I know exactly what it's about.  I know exactly why Sam does this now. 
[00:36:00]  It's under the guise of Jocktober?  Yeah.  I mean, that's how he presented his stuff today.  Mm-hmm.  You know, clips of me yesterday on the show trying to explain why I was upset about the Chevrolet commercial.  Fez, in all honesty, you were a babbling lunatic yesterday.  This is your show now, Sam.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You finally did it.  Yeah.  How does that...  How would it occur to any person? 
[00:36:30]  Well, he put two and two together as far as why you did it.  Right.  The whole...  Not only were all you guys involved in, like, yes, please.  I didn't say shit.  You said lots of shit.  I didn't say nothing.  A ton of it.  But the entire staff was in the office going, yeah, we got to present these clips to O&A tomorrow.  Just saying everybody was involved?  And Fez doesn't want to acknowledge that for whatever reason?  Fez continues.  Sam did this just because of the Troy Quant situation. 
[00:37:00]  That's all this is about.  Wow.  I didn't get to hear this.  Dude.  Wow.  I had to get my kid to school.  I was bummed that Ronnie didn't address this the first hour because that's when I was listening.  Wow.  Even I was like, I did not see this coming.  So Fez was one of the guys that really had a problem with the Troy Quant stuff?  Yeah.  Well, Fez went on the air immediately after the Troy Quant fight that got him in trouble.  Oh, right. 
[00:37:30]  It said he was scared and stuff.  And said he felt threatened.  Felt threatened that Troy would be...  That's just silly.  Silly.  Because he knows Troy wouldn't do shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wouldn't even do shit on the air.  But that was like the first major negative reaction that Troy got from that fight.  Was from Fezzy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So he ramped it up a little bit?  Oh, boy.  I don't know if he ramped it up or that's how he felt, but he...  You can see where Fezzy's coming from, certainly.  So that's why you have this vendetta against Fez? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Why are you hassling Fez?  Yeah.  So he thinks this is our way of getting back at Fez for us.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's the wrong pronoun.  I mean...  No.  Oh, you.  It's Sam Roberts' way of getting back at Fez.  Because, obviously, the Opie and Anthony show is being manipulated by one puppet master,  and that man's name is Sam Roberts.  I don't think anybody would deny that.  That's fairly true.  It's just me, huh?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Congratulations to me, then.  Yeah.  Because for some reason, I'm still getting blamed for that. 
[00:38:30]  And so Sam's going to try to take it out on me any which way he can, instead of just saying that.  Where I'm supposedly to blame for a suspension.  Well, let me make this clear to every...  We've never said that.  Nobody said it.  Have we ever said that?  No.  No.  No.  I've got to say, we've never said that.  I didn't say that.  I hired someone to skywrite it, but I never said it.  Nobody's ever said that.  It hasn't even come up, like, in a joking form.  Yeah, we've never said that. 
[00:39:00]  No, we actually said...  We were kind of mad at Fez that, you know, he was misreading the situation, because there's  no reason why Fez should be worried about Troy Kwan ever.  But then we knew he had gone to management and said, you know, hey, don't do anything,  you know.  Yeah, I knew that.  We knew he did that.  Yeah, which was cool.  Right.  That's fine.  I hadn't...  I haven't thought about Fez and Troy Kwan's interaction since it happened.  Right.  You're not very nice.  Wow, we never said that, Fezzy.  Nobody did.  No one on this show thinks that. 
[00:39:30]  Well, let me make this clear to everybody out there.  The only time I went down the fucking hallway about Troy was to tell management, don't fire  the guy.  I shook my hand at my wedding.  That was the one trip I made.  I never asked for a suspension.  I never asked for the guy to lose his job.  I went down the hallway to say, don't fire him.  You little scamps get together.  But this is being projected on me. 
[00:40:00]  And trust me, I found out later there was a contingency of people upstairs upset by that  day.  What exactly is a contingency?  A large group.  Okay.  A large group of people upset that day that went to one of the outcube guys to go down  the hallway, talk to management, and have something done about it.  I wasn't part of that group.  And I told them, I don't want anything to happen to the guy, but this is Sam's way of 
[00:40:30]  retaliation because this is going on and Troy's not on the air.  I can't disagree.  That's what this is all fucking about.  Absolutely.  And so I'm letting everyone know I didn't have anything to do that, do with that.  So what you're saying is you're taking this all in the spirit of good fun.  Rodney knows how to break that tension with a quick line, man.  But he's incorrect.  That's not how Fez is taking it.  Oh, Jimmy, see what he did. 
[00:41:00]  Why would I care if Troy Kwan's on the air or not?  Well, I mean, you like Troy.  Yeah, I like him.  I could see Fez's point if this was more of a cause.  But he wants the word crazy banned from a Chevrolet commercial.  Oh, right.  Of course we're going to bring that to our show.  That's crazy talk.  Why did I pull the blueberries clip?  Right.  Oh, come on.  Oh, boy.  Remember when he said that blueberries was a standalone fruit?  It is a standalone fruit.  It's one of my favorite things ever. 
[00:41:30]  It is a good moment.  And I didn't pull that because of a vendetta.  We all have shitty moments.  Yeah.  That's one of the greatest shitty moments of all time.  It's funny.  It's wonderful.  Yes.  That's right.  It's happened to all of us.  I will say this.  Or you try something and it fails miserably and then you're incredibly uncomfortable and  trying to get yourself out of it.  It's a home run.  It's a home run.  And not only a home run, it's out of the ballpark itself.  It's a fucking home run.  It's a monster home run. 
[00:42:00]  And if I had a secret vendetta, why would I wait a month after Troy gets back before I  did anything?  You're trying to oversell this, Sam.  Relax.  It's fine.  Yeah.  If you got a secret vendetta, just be a man and say it.  We all know.  It's fine.  Nobody actually takes this seriously is what you're saying?  No.  We are.  There's not a person that believes that this is why we brought the crazy shit to the show  yesterday.  All right, then.  And then I got told later on as well that the stuff I was really upset about had nothing 
[00:42:30]  to do with it whatsoever, that that wasn't even going to be looked at.  So why did you throw up?  Why are you upset?  Why can't you just act like it's no big deal?  Because to me, it is a big deal to get attacked like that.  And it's all Sam because he's upset about what happened with Troy.  And that, I mean, I vocalized it on the air, but I didn't have anything to do with any  repercussions.  That can't be further from the truth.  That can't be possibly. 
[00:43:00]  And you should have, you know, if it bothered you, you should have talked about it on the  show.  Makes for great radio.  What?  If he was bothered by what Troy did.  Of course.  It is what it is, but there's no secret vendettas here.  I don't think anybody.  Well, yeah, but you've had a weird thing with him since that incident.  Oh, boy.  Have you found it to be so?  Yeah, it was odd.  Oh, my God.  You're going to get Fezzy going.  What?  Sam coming in going, look, we can get, let's do this. 
[00:43:30]  And we're like, why don't you leave him alone?  And he's fucking comes in with something else.  Sam, you don't like the gays?  Sam, Jim's devil's advocate routine is not good for somebody who's obviously irrationally  paranoid.  Right.  Yeah.  See, you're calling him paranoid.  I don't think he is paranoid.  Oh, boy.  Are you a fan of the gays?  I love the gays.  You love the gays.  You want to make that point today?  Gays are some of my favorite people on this planet.  Very insincere.  I've never heard you say that before. 
[00:44:00]  I don't think anybody's upset.  I'm upset.  Why are you upset?  I'm upset because Sam's pulling this shit on me.  Just because he's upset about something I didn't do.  That would take it to the point where Sam cared about Troy.  I don't believe that's true.  Sam only cares about Sam.  So that's the problem with the logic of this. 
[00:44:30]  The one character judgment I can't disagree with.  Yep.  I mean, I heard that yesterday.  I was like, oh, yeah.  Ronnie hits it right on the head.  Hell of an argument.  Yep.  That was a bit too real right there.  It's all he's got is to try to look for someone's fuck ups.  You know, all these years he's been doing that show.  And that's all he's got at this point.  Absolutely.  That is, oh, E-Rock ate something.  Sal was late.  Whatever.  Yep.  Sal was late.  Why are you angry?  He's got a point there.  Because I know what this is about now. 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  And I'm putting it out there.  Good.  It's not a big deal.  You don't find it slightly funny?  No.  We were part of Jocktober after all these years.  I mean, I was like.  You don't find it slightly funny?  Ronnie was honored to be part of Jocktober.  Of course.  He said it was a little too long in the making.  He assumed he would have been part of Jocktober years ago.  And that this is more like one of those lifetime achievement awards. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Fez is wrapped tight these days.  He's pretty tight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to loosen up a little bit.  Yeah.  You got to relax a little, Fez.  It's not all.  Follow the lead of Ron.  See?  Yeah.  That's just hilarious.  It's fun.  There's not always a big battle.  October after all these years.  I mean, how does that not strike you as funny?  It's been going on for a million years and we finally made it.  Did it.  And I see it more as a lifetime achievement award. 
[00:46:00]  I really do.  This is something we should have gotten 10 years ago.  You know?  It should have happened again seven years ago.  Five years ago.  That was ours locked in.  To get it now.  The bittersweetness of it.  We know it's for a lifetime worth of work.  There you go.  Good job, Ron.  Ron's great.  So there's your update.  Yep.  And Sam Roberts didn't go into the studio.  No.  I heard them asking for Sam to come in and discuss it with Fezzy. 
[00:46:30]  But why wouldn't you?  Were you scared?  I was not scared.  Oh.  I felt that this argument had reached a point of lunacy that even I had no idea it would go to.  You do try to look for people's mistakes, though.  Fez did raise a point there.  Yeah, but the absurdity of Fez implying that I am one-dimensional.  Oh, man.  Now you're just attacking the guy again.  Wow.  We're done with this.  No, Jim presented that fact to me. 
[00:47:00]  Did you hear some people were calling in and stuff and saying that you don't have the right  to say anything about Fez because he's a veteran and you are a mere fucking rookie?  Of the Thousand Psychic Wars?  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I heard people saying that, but if somebody is taking shots at me, I'm going  to take shots back at them.  I don't know.  Yeah, but we were done with it.  Ronnie ended with a nice laugh, brought us all back together, and then you start new shit.  No, Jim.  Jim.  You start a new shit right there.  Jim started that.  Well, I started shit. 
[00:47:30]  Ronnie brought everyone back together and he started making fun of the fact that, you know,  he thinks it's an honor that he's part of Jackie.  We're keeping it fun.  And the laugh was there.  The track ended.  We were ready to move on and you had to say what you said.  No, no.  Jim.  I didn't hear Jim.  What did I say?  Exactly.  We reincorporated the conversation.  Oh, boy.  I just see, you know, you beating up on a poor guy and it's not right.  I'm not beating up on anyone.  Guy's in a tough place right now.  You're hitting him while he's down.  Exactly.  Fucking bully.  You're right.  It's just not in the spirit of this show.  That's what we're starting to learn. 
[00:48:00]  Attaboy, Sam.  It's about time you learned that lesson.  Bullshit.  It's just smart enough.  We don't like making fun of people on this show.  No, it's mean-spirited.  Smart enough.  Yep.  Right.  We do have another Jacktober today, though, correct?  Excellent.  Who?  The official Jacktober.  Yes, yes.  The real Jacktober.  Yes, thank God.  It's hard to make, you know, Ron's show the official Jacktober.  No.  It was kind of a, what would you call it?  Like an add-on.  Like a little.  Exhibition.  Homage. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And we never said the show itself was Jacktobered.  Oh, no.  Because the show is-  There was a Jacktober moment.  Right.  Ron and Fez show is a brilliant show that I listen to every day.  Well, why'd you put it in Jacktober?  There was an element to the show.  So you're saying that half of that show-  I wouldn't call it half.  It should be-  So you're saying that Fez is less than half of the show and he deserves to be Jacktobered?  Well, I mean-  By the way, speaking of Jacktober-  I'm not saying that.  What piece of audio are we going to do to end it this year? 
[00:49:00]  We're working on that.  We're running out of bad bits, aren't we?  I hope at this point.  E-Rock and me spent some time going through tapes.  E-Rock-  Okay.  Because this is also, not only is the end of Jacktober like a celebration, it's a big  moment for E-Rock because you guys, or we, spend the year making fun of him.  Yeah.  And if he can find me a great-  Nugget.  O-N-A-Nugget.  See, in the spirit of Jacktober, we make fun of ourselves.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  The last day of Jacktober every year.  Right.  Tradition.  It's a tradition.  That just goes to show all the shows that we bash, that it's all in good fun.  Yeah.  Right.  And we can laugh at ourselves and control the laughs.  Right.  Yes, exactly.  Right.  You laugh at yourselves one day a year.  Uh-huh.  And then every other day.  Oh, yeah.  You just bash.  However, if one radio show says, I don't get this Opie and Anthony show, it's four hours  of-  Fucking kill him!  Damn it! 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Yeah.  I can't wait to hear it.  Where are they from, by the way?  Don't say the name of the show, but what city-  I wouldn't even say that.  No?  No.  I will say this, because you want, you know, the fans to have their fun.  It's a major market.  Okay.  Major market.  And it's United States?  United States of America.  Major market in the U.S.  South of here.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Pretty south of here.  Oh.  Right. 
[00:50:30]  Major market.  That's all I want to say, though.  Mm-hmm.  Because part of the fun is when the segment starts, and you announce it, and then everybody  scammers.  Everyone goes.  Right, right.  And does, you know, what they're going to do.  Whatever they do, I don't know.  We have never encouraged that.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  We got Paul Williams coming in today.  We have this new, weird friendship with Paul Williams.  Paul Williams.  I was trying to find that, by the way. 
[00:51:00]  An old-fashioned love song, the version that you sing, and I can only find the new one.  Oh, man.  I want an old version.  I think we played it.  Did we?  Playing on the radio.  Are we setting up keyboards for Paul Williams?  We're working on it.  What do you mean working on it?  Working on it.  This should be done.  Yeah, we're trying to find a keyboard that we can use.  We have a great songwriter coming in today, and, you know, we wanted him to just fucking  sing the whole time.  Oh, wait a minute.  From the Muppet Show.  Old-fashioned love song from, um...  And that looked old.  Yeah, this is an old one. 
[00:51:30]  All right, let's pop that up, and let's see if he's...  Doing that on the radio.  Doing radio.  Doing radio.  Well, well.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Oh, yeah.  Laying on the radio.  Radio.  And wrapped around the music is the sound of someone promising that they'll never go. 
[00:52:00]  You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on.  On and on.  Don't need him for ringing them back because they've never really gone.  That's just an old-fashioned love song coming down in two-part harmony.  That's just an old-fashioned love song.  When I'm sure...  When I'm...  When I'm...  When you had made a weep on dreams of... 
[00:52:30]  Oh, the great Paul Williams.  ...to each evening when the lights are low.  No!  The lights are low!  To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feeling that we've come to know.  No!  How can anyone not like Paul Williams?  You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on.  No need in bringing them back in the cold bag on.  Gone.  That's just an old-fashioned love song. 
[00:53:00]  Coming down in three-part harmony.  He was that good of a writer because...  But then the voice became what it is.  Yeah.  You know what I'm trying to say?  Like, if you came out today, it sounded like that.  I don't know if you would have a spot in music.  Right.  You'd have to be a very good songwriter.  I want him to just sing songs his entire appearance.  I know.  Right?  Yeah.  I just want him to sit behind the keyboard and just sing whatever the fuck he wants for  an hour.  I know. 
[00:53:30]  That's what I want to hear.  Let's do that.  Are we celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Muppet movie?  The original Muppet...  Muppet movie.  You should say Muppet, right?  He wrote, It's Not Easy Being Green.  Right?  I like that, too.  Oh, or Rainbow Connection?  Rainbow Connection.  He wrote that one.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Okay.  Rainbow Connection's the one.  And then there's the Three Dog Night version.  Which one do you like better, Jimmy?  I know the Three Dog Night version. 
[00:54:00]  Could you find a little bit of the...  No, of an old-fashioned love song.  Let me hear theirs because I like the poem.  Find a little Three Dog Night version.  I'm probably going to go poems.  No, man.  It's Three Dog Night.  They knew what they were doing.  They did do a good job.  They made it sound a lot darker.  Yeah.  Ready. 
[00:54:30]  Just a different interpretation.  It's good.  It's really good.  I like this guy's voice.  Yeah, really good.  I think Paul's has more character, though.  Yeah, definitely.  Paul Williams' version is a lot more, like, almost campy. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, it's up.  It's got, like, the horns, the little, like...  We've got to ask him about this.  Yeah.  If he liked the Three Dog Night version.  He must have because they made it a huge hit.  Jesus, did they ever.  But this is effortless.  The guy is singing effortless.  No.  I like fucking Three Dog Night.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  On and on.  I want to hear that.  I like Paul Williams' better, though, but I do like this.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  I can't wait to see him.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  When I'm sure they've worked for you and me.  Just an old-fashioned love song. 
[00:56:00]  What are the other songs Three Dog Night did?  Did they do Mama Told Me Not to Come?  She said...  Yeah, they did that.  Which was kind of trippy.  They did...  Not Three Times.  Joy to the World.  No, that was the other song.  That's Tony Orlando and Don.  That was Tony Orlando.  Yeah.  Wait, what other songs did they do?  I'm trying to remember now.  Oh, right.  They have Joy to the World. 
[00:56:30]  Shambhala.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They did.  Well, I've never been to Spain.  But I kind of like the music.  Can you play that just a little bit?  And they did one.  That's right.  Yeah.  They had a lot of hits.  One is the loneliest number one.  Do they write this or do they cover it?  One is the loneliest number one.  Wait, we've got two songs going on.  Yeah, that's the one. 
[00:57:00]  And they go with Never Been to Spain that Ann was talking about.  This was a Harry Nilsson song, was it?  Which one?  Was it?  Number one?  One?  Harry Nilsson, maybe?  And which one is this?  Never Been to Spain.  Oh, he kicks in now. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, he kicks in now.  But I kind of like the blues.  Good like it.  That's got to play until it kicks in.  Of course.  Jesus.  Oh, I see a keyboard stand coming in.  Yeah.  That's all he's going to bring.  Yeah.  Keyboard stand. 
[00:58:00]  Let's be.  All right.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, yeah.  But I've been to Oklahoma.  Well, they tell me I was born there.  But I really don't remember.  That's good shit right there. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, three dog night.  Three dog night with you.  Hey, it's Dennis Falcone.  Playing a little three dog night.  You know, a three dog night is actually a term used up in Alaska.  When they get cold, they'd have to sleep with their dogs to keep warm. 
[00:59:00]  And if it was a three dog night, it was really cold because you needed three dogs to keep warm.  Three dog night.  Never been to Spain.  Oh, I've never been to Spain.  All right.  Mid-song ramp up.  I like mid-song ramp.  Nice.  And we'll be back.  Let's play it out.  Fuck it.  Ladies, I'm insane there.  And they sure don't I use it. 
[00:59:30]  Big time I'm using.  Never gonna lose it.  I can't refuse it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, I've never been to heaven.  But I've been to Oklahoma.  Oh, they tell me I was born there. 
[01:00:00]  But I really don't remember.  In Oklahoma.  Not Arizona.  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:00:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  Just a cast away. 
[01:01:00]  I lost that sea.  Another lonely day.  You had to do this, right, Travis?  Oh, boy.  This is your favorite version, right?  Oh, fucking loot.  He finally even realized the loot's stupid.  The loot stunk.  Thank you, Kenny.  Why didn't he do a second album with the loot?  Because he even realized.  No one wanted his loot.  We've had some moments on the show.  This moment is me and Jimmy's moment. 
[01:01:30]  We went and saw Sting and his loot.  So disappointing.  We were so bummed.  I can't believe you went to see that.  Was Patrice with us or no?  We were thanking God that he wasn't.  No, there's no way he was there.  We were thanking God that he wasn't.  Because he wouldn't have been able to help himself.  Oh, he'd have been.  No, me and Jimmy are sitting there going.  I remember.  Going, thank God Patrice isn't here.  He would have ruined it.  Because everyone's sitting there all polite.  Song after song.  No one knows.  Just politely clapping like this at the end of the song.  Meanwhile, like.  He brought some legendary loot player with him from fucking Europe. 
[01:02:00]  Who gives a shit?  And finally, at the end of the performance, he did this.  With the loot.  I think he did maybe two songs that were recognizable.  And then we met him.  And then, you know, I was a huge police fan growing up.  Yeah.  And my fucking camera.  I'm not as bad as Jimmy, but.  I know this is going to be the only chance I get to meet Sting.  Of course.  And the fucking flash didn't go off.  Oh, no.  So I politely said, there was only, how many people were getting pictures that day? 
[01:02:30]  Seriously.  It was this very, very small group.  I don't even think it was 20.  It might have been like a dozen.  So I wasn't holding up anybody.  I wasn't holding up Sting.  Denied?  No.  He got really mad.  And in the picture, you could see he's scowling because he had to take a second picture.  Was he serious?  And I even thanked him, and I apologized.  He was just like, I don't know.  He's just an angry guy.  Some guys are graceless with people.  They're graceless.  Is that the way to put it?  I think so, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  In that situation, because he was in front of the XM marquee, it was about meeting.  Right.  It wasn't like he was walking with his wife down the street, and you were hassling him.  No, not at all.  Maybe that's what happens when you fuck for 20 hours and don't calm.  Get a little fucking pissed.  Do you think so?  The tantric's making him cranky.  Yeah, fuck that tantric shit.  He's 60.  I want to shoot a load ASAP.  I'll tell you this.  ASAP.  I'll tell you this, watch.  He's 62 today.  He looks great.  62?  Doing something right.  Yeah.  Is he still with that Trudy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  She's looking all right, too, man.  I actually do see him walking around New York.  Oh, yeah?  I saw them walking.  Yeah, they're in our neighborhood.  You see him every once in a while, and you go, holy fuck, that sting.  He's a biggie when you see him walking around.  You're like, holy fuck.  He's a star, man.  He's a star.  I said hi to him.  He said hello.  He's walking by.  I am?  I was like, hi, sting.  He's like, hello.  Jim?  No.  No.  He didn't say that.  No.  No, the very important part was not there.  If he said, hello, Jim, you would have had to run home and come, right?  I would have done it right there.  Why are you waiting at home? 
[01:04:00]  I would have tantically come on his heels.  I don't know.  You got to, I guess, respect him that he's trying different things, but that loot project.  Could you play the one that we've made fun of a million times?  Oh, that one.  The one.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Yeah, yeah.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  That was terrible.  Musicians who've made new recordings.  What?  God.  No, that's not the one we played. 
[01:04:30]  Sam's going to find them.  I have another one that might be it.  Let me see.  Yeah, yeah.  At least entertaining clip possible, as per Nick.  Yeah, here it is.  Come again, sweet laughter from now and part.  Thy graces that we find.  I'm at the Ren Fair.  Yeah.  The fuck is this?  Could I have some mead and a steak on a steak?  To kiss.  To die.  To die.  To die.  With me again, in sweetest sea of breath. 
[01:05:00]  To sing, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die.  How infuriating is it to hear him sing Die?  To die.  Come again, that I may see.  Yeah, that's great.  Could you play Don't Stand So Close to Me?  Please.  That's the only chance I'm going to get to see you.  Please, Roxanne.  Anything?  Here it comes again. 
[01:05:30]  I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die.  Oh, God.  I die.  I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die.  It just gets funnier now.  Why is he saying it that way?  Why?  He knows better, Opie.  He's an artist.  Good point. 
[01:06:00]  This is like crazy.  It's really, it's not bad, but if you want something, the police, this is weird.  Where does that fit?  Where would you play this?  Oh, it's different.  Oh.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  That makes my joys to grow.  I frowns the features of my world. 
[01:06:30]  He's right on key with everything, though, man.  He does have a good voice.  He's a talented fuck.  Yeah, that's the guy.  There he is.  Let me see his picture.  The loot guy that he brought in.  Because Sting talked about how he's just a beginner with this instrument and blah, blah, blah.  But here's the expert.  The word he uses, this guy's a looting cunt.  Is there one more?  Come on, one more. 
[01:07:00]  Please?  For us?  No, thanks.  Soundtrack to fucking.  Oh, well.  Well, happy birthday, Sting.  62.  Stink.  Stink.  He had a pretty popular solo effort there, too.  I liked a couple of his solo songs.  I can't think of them right now. 
[01:07:30]  Field of Gold or Field of Dreams.  No, yeah, one that was really good.  What the fuck was it?  He liked singing about the Russians for a while there.  Oh.  Well.  What song did he like by him?  I didn't like his solo stuff as much.  I kind of liked.  And it was extremely successful.  God damn it.  It was really kind of a hit, I think.  Which one?  Well, no one's helping me here on Peltalk.  Well, because he had a lot of hits.  Little fuckwads.  How did it go? 
[01:08:00]  Now you're doing rolling.  Yeah.  Ah, shit.  I wish I could remember.  Fortress Around Your Heart?  Um, no, I don't think it was.  No, I would hate this.  No, no.  I don't like this at all.  No.  Um, no, not Englishman in New York.  I hate that song.  I don't know that one.  Yeah, you do.  I'm Englishman in New York.  Probably know it.  Yeah, you probably would.  I hate that song.  No, if Ant's saying he likes a Sting song, it's got to be upbeat. 
[01:08:30]  I'm trying to think.  Not necessarily.  Ant doesn't really like to bring it down.  It was good.  I wish I could fucking remember this.  God, I remember fucking commercial jingles from 1965, and I can't fucking remember a Sting song.  We'll get his Wikipedia up.  We'll go through the songs real fast.  And then we'll move into this jock-toe.  That was it.  What?  Thank you, sir.  Who got it first?  I got it.  No, I have to give this guy some credit. 
[01:09:00]  I think it was, uh, I got it right here.  Oh, Lose My Faith in You.  Oh, okay.  I liked that.  That's a good song.  Runti got it.  That's a good song.  I liked it.  Because his voice is very good in it.  It's very melodic.  And it's a slow, slower song.  Yeah.  It's not a complete animal.  Oh.  My sister probably fucking.  No, it's not free, free, set them free, Dawn.  Free, free, set them free. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, God.  I hate that song.  Ding, a wacky video.  I do know this one, sure.  You do?  Of course.  The chorus is nice.  You know what?  I do like this one.  I think it reminds me of when I worked at Pergament, though.  A lot of these songs from the 80s.  I love your Pergament stories.  I hated them, though, because I would be doing an Iron Day from 930 to 930, and I'd have  to hear these fucking...  Over and over again.  This is 93. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, 93.  That's not what I know.  93.  Wow.  I was not content, my friend.  Dude, this song is 20 years old.  It's okay.  That's 20 years.  20 years?  Yeah, it's okay.  Holy fuck.  I saw the police reunion.  This thing has good range.  I saw that at Madison Square Garden a couple years back now, and they were great, but I don't  think Sting really fucking wants to do that anymore. 
[01:10:30]  No, huh?  I think he put it together to help the other guys out a little bit.  That's the worst.  That is the worst when you're in a band where the singer gets really more famous as a solo  artist, and then you're like, dude, hook us up.  In all fairness, he didn't call it in at all.  It was a great show, but you just got to feeling like, all right, look, are you happy?  I finally did this.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, because I'm done with this.  I'm doing my thing.  Leave me alone now.  He doesn't need the money, but I think everyone was begging for it for so long, he finally 
[01:11:00]  gave in.  Why would you want to split it with those guys?  That's a lot of it.  If you want your solo guy, you get to fucking call the shots and keep all the money.  Yeah, you could just go out there and fucking with studio musicians.  I just love that reggae sound they had.  It was like pop reggae, whatever, but I just loved the sound they had as a band.  You never mixed up The Police with any other band back when they were a big band in the  80s and stuff like that?  Yeah.  You knew.  You fucking knew that with The Police.  I was never a huge fan, though. 
[01:11:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I wouldn't turn them off, but I wasn't like, oh, cool, The Police are on.  Zenyatta Mandata.  I would need, you know.  That shit.  I'd be a lot more psyched if Saga came on, On the Loose.  Oh, gosh.  That would have gone.  What?  Come on.  No, I like that song.  Great song.  It was a good song.  Do they ever have another song?  No one could stop you now.  Now.  It's very, tonight.  It's very, no one to tell you how.  I like this.  Ant's picking the songs today.  To let you on the loose. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, this is fucking.  This was one of those songs that made you a fag instantly in your car.  You really thought you could pull this song off.  And you over-exaggerate it when you sing it.  What, I'm the only one?  Get the fuck out of here.  You'd be fucking driving.  Yeah.  Tonight.  The Loose.  To yourself.  This is the part. 
[01:12:30]  Here we go.  Reaching for something else.  No one can stop you now.  No.  No.  The Loose.  No one to tell you how.  Tonight you're on the loose.  It really is being given in proclamation form.  It really is.  The fucking town crier is singing.  No one to tell you how. 
[01:13:00]  Tonight you're on the loose.  This was one of those videos that were always heavy fucking rotation.  I will never understand.  So a band like Saga comes out with this.  Yeah.  Do they have another hit before I go into this dumb rant?  One of those not quite as big as this song hit.  But how does a band that has on the loose, which most people really liked, it was kind  of one of those weird guilty pleasures.  It was a huge hit.  And then nothing. 
[01:13:30]  Nothing.  What happens?  No one to stop you now.  They got the same manager as Modern English, who said, guys, just stop.  One is good.  Yeah.  That's all you need.  No one to tell you how.  Tonight you're on the loose.  Paul Williams.  I saw Modern English once.  Oh, no.  That's right.  I've told this story, I'm sure, a million times, too.  I love that they did this.  They played I'll Melt With You twice because they just didn't have enough songs for their 
[01:14:00]  set.  And I think their set was only, there was a bunch of bands that day.  I think their set was maybe a half hour.  They just couldn't fill up a half hour.  So they had to play I'll Melt With You twice.  Oh, God.  Embarrassing.  I think they pretty much started and ended with I'll Melt With You.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because people are like, holy fuck, they're starting with this?  What are they going to end with?  Well, they're going to end with I'll Melt With You.  Jeez.  Saga.  You know Saga came out with a Greatest Hits album?  What's on it? 
[01:14:30]  It's a 45.  It's this song 12 times.  What was it?  Time's Up.  Time's Up.  What was their second hit?  Time's Up.  What is Saga's other hit?  Can you play Time's Up for a second?  God, this sounds like 28.  You've got to be like.  20 80s songs.  You've got to be an uber fan to know this, I think.  Yeah.  I think they might have had something else that was sort of a hit.  I have one more song.  It's called Wind Em Up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wind Em Up. 
[01:15:00]  Wind Em Up.  Yeah.  I remember that one, actually.  Yeah.  You'll know.  See that one.  It wasn't huge.  It's the backwards on the loose that we're talking about.  Yeah.  The One Hit Wonders always had that second song.  To tell you how.  Right.  Tonight you're on the loose.  They took their hit and they just scrambled up the music a little bit.  Tonight you're coming on for more.  And there's every indication we may be headed far or far. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's the same song.  Today we're on the loose.  Yes.  I barely remember this.  Yeah.  They try to make this a hit.  Poor guys.  God, really?  What year is this?  80s.  It's got to be 80s, right?  When do you realize you're a one hit wonder?  Yeah.  How many years before you're like, fuck it? 
[01:16:00]  Well, then what happens with some of these bands, they go overseas and they're not a  one hit wonder.  I heard Aldo Nova used to do his song twice, too.  Fantasy.  Fantasy.  Let's just the fantasy.  You know.  I got to say it again.  I was in Rochester.  I saw Paul Simon.  Paul Simon in concert was ridiculously good.  Yeah.  He's another one that could fucking sing his songs. 
[01:16:30]  I wouldn't like I would never go out and buy Paul Simon shit.  But it was Rochester.  Not a lot of the big acts came through.  So I went and saw Paul Simon.  He played You Could Call Me Al.  I told this story on the air, too.  I just want to acknowledge that.  And it was like a seven, eight minute version.  It was over the top.  He had like fucking 20 musicians on.  Porns and stuff.  Oh, it was ridiculous how great You Could Call Me Al was live.  And the whole Rochester War Memorial at the time.  I'm not sure what they call it now.  Everyone was on their feet just fucking loving it.  Really? 
[01:17:00]  And then he goes, wow, that was fun.  And he goes, you know what?  Let's do it again.  And went right back into it.  And no one minded.  That's hilarious.  Actually, when he did it the second time, he even got a better reaction.  That's great.  Yeah, you probably knew.  You know, no one's going to care.  Because he was so involved with, like you said, the horns and the dancers and the backup singers.  It was just ridiculous.  This was a song in a movie.  I remember when I was a kid hearing this on the movie channel previews.  Like I forget what movie this was in.  Really?  It's weird how you hear a song and you just remember that moment of watching the previews for a film. 
[01:17:30]  What movie was it?  I don't know.  Hmm.  If You Be My Buddy.  That's what you do.  What?  This is when I was younger.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  This is 1989.  This is where he picked up, like, that African sound.  That African sound.  He had them on stage.  Oh, boy, did he.  Yeah.  Some real live Africans.  Oh, they were dressed apart.  The whole, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I vividly remember this one.  It was a hell of a show. 
[01:18:00]  Nice.  Whatever happened to him?  I guess he just got old, right?  Paul Simon?  Yeah.  Yeah, he kind of looks like Don Rickles now.  He looks really old.  Julio.  Is there a song with Julio or no?  Me and Julio down by the school.  Julio.  That's a great song.  Yeah.  Me and Julio.  Probably sound lame saying that Paul Simon's song is a great song.  Different types of music.  What the fuck are you going to do?  You know, you're going to stick to one genre.  We're going to get Jogtobered. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stupid Chevy Chase in the video.  Oh, right.  Remember?  He was, like, playing the horn.  Yeah.  The video wasn't that great at all.  I never liked Chevy Chase.  I don't think I ever really liked him.  I enjoyed him in a couple of things for moments.  Caddyshack, he was good in?  Yeah, yeah.  Caddyshack.  Vacation?  Vacation.  Yeah, the first vacation's fucking hilarious.  Love that one.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:19:00]  And then, um, then not so much.  Fletch.  You know what I noticed the other day?  Fuck.  I was watching Fast Times at Ridgemont High, again, of course, and at the end, the guy that  comes in to Rob Hamilton, and that fucking, uh, he comes in with a gun.  Right.  I know what a safe is.  I've been watching this place.  Because that guy is the guy that gets killed in the opening of Django on his horse.  No way.  That fucking falls over, and he's still alive, and the slaves shoot him in the fucking head. 
[01:19:30]  That's the same fucking guy.  How do you know?  I just recognized him.  Did he have a career between Fast Times and Django?  Yes, he did.  He was in fucking 48 Hours.  Wow.  That's 82.  That's right after Fast Times.  Yeah, 48 Hours.  He was in, uh, uh, Beverly Hills Cop.  Um, he was in a few, a few fucking movies and TV shows and whatnot.  No kidding.  Yeah.  He's the guy.  He's the fucking guy.  All right, Hamilton.  You notice how out of shape Forrest Whitaker is in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and he's 
[01:20:00]  supposed to be the big football star?  He's just the big football, yeah.  Got that tight jacket on.  I tried, uh.  Earth, wind, and fire, and little brother.  I tried to turn my wife on to Fast Times at Ridgemont High, having a young wife, you know,  turn her on to some of my movies.  Sure.  And it was in a hotel room in Philly, and it was the TV version.  Oh, you can't wait.  Oh, yuck.  It's horrendous.  It's so bad.  It's not the same movie.  No.  Because they add all that other shit, all those scenes that weren't in the actual movie. 
[01:20:30]  That were edited out.  Because they have to get rid of so much stuff for the TV version.  Yeah.  We turned it off.  I'm like, I can't believe this is the same fucking movie.  Uh-huh.  Horrible.  Could be one of the worst TV edits ever of a movie.  Yeah.  You know, all that shit in the bathroom and stuff that wasn't in the regular movie.  Yeah.  And there were a couple other scenes.  Because they had to cut out so much.  Right.  That's him.  James Russo.  Oh, Jesus.  He was in Public Enemies.  He was in Donnie Brasco. 
[01:21:00]  Donnie Brasco.  Yeah, he's been in a few.  He's got a good little career there.  Yeah.  He's recognizable.  He was Eddie Murphy's friend that got killed in Beverly Hills Cop with the Barabons.  It's like, they're Barabons.  And then, actually, Mike from fucking Mike from Breaking Bad comes up and shoots him in the head.  In fucking Beverly Hills Cop.  What?  It's crazy.  It's a smorgasbord of modern cinema magic.  I ain't kidding. 
[01:21:30]  We got to go to Jim and O.  Iowa City.  Because you brought up Aldo Nova.  Aldo Nova.  I like that dumb fantasy song.  Life is just a fantasy.  Life is fantasy.  And we're learning he plays that twice.  Yeah, he plays it twice in concert.  Okay.  And now Jim's going to try to turn us on to another.  Oh, are you going to go with Balls and Chains?  No, no, no, no.  That's the only other Aldo Nova song I know.  Just trying to show some knowledge today.  Thank you.  Oh.  What do you got, Jim? 
[01:22:00]  Actually, am I on the air?  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, Monkey on Your Back.  Remember that one?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Monkey on My...  That was a fantastic song.  I mean, he's just singing about his girl being hooked on drugs.  And then they went to that electronic version of his voice.  Oh, yeah?  Dancing around.  All right.  Shut up and we'll hear a little bit of it.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Aldo Nova.  Monkey on Your Back.  That's got to be one of these videos. 
[01:22:30]  Really?  Where they, like, made a whole big fucking movie.  They thought they were making movies back then.  With these dumb videos.  Yeah.  Mini movie.  Yeah.  I think Michael Jackson started that with Thriller.  Oh.  Wasn't that really the first one that was kind of...  Pretty much.  Oh, God.  These special effects aren't very special.  Oh, my God.  Look at the 80s.  Whoa.  Oh, he's singing, but talking to the guy in the song lyrics. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yuck.  They're just hanging out.  Terrible.  With their shirts off.  These guys are cool.  He used to be brilliant witchy.  Put them too many rounds on the horse.  Got them hooking in the village.  Uh, who would be scared of these guys?  So, remind me.  You used to dress like that and you would get chicks, right?  You'd be a tough guy and get chicks.  Yeah.  He's always there. 
[01:23:30]  He can't deny it.  I just got all the features in the video.  Oh, with the bad effects.  Bad effects.  There's a green screen and there's stars behind them.  Right.  They're in space.  Look at them.  The three guitars in a row where they're tilting the necks up at the same time.  And the guy's wearing the Asian shirt.  The Chinese flag shirt.  The Japanese flag shirt with the Japanese writing on it.  Shirtless drummer with a big dangly earring in.  He's got a hell of a voice.  80s chick.  Oh.  Wait a minute. 
[01:24:00]  What?  What is this guy's gut hanging out?  What is that?  This is terrible.  Whoa.  I want a tooth like that.  All right.  That's great.  That's fantastic.  Thank you for that.  Aldo Nova.  Monkey on your back.  Check out the video.  It's classic 80s schlock.  Yep.  God damn.  I love it.  Whenever VH1 or VH1 Classic is playing 80s videos, you've got to stop on it. 
[01:24:30]  You've got to watch, right?  Because it's just so fucking funny to watch now.  And back then you were just watching like, wow, this is cool.  Right.  Now it's like, ew, this was never cool.  Fantasy was a huge MTV song.  Oh, my God.  They would play that all the time.  Wow.  I bet he had a problem keeping his weight down.  Aldo Nova.  I bet Aldo Nova really had a problem trimming down for these videos.  He looks like he's right on the verge of puffing up. 
[01:25:00]  That's funny.  Wow.  It's amazing how bad the videos were.  Aldo Nagel.  Jesus Christ.  Got a monkey on my back.  You know what else I used to love?  Fucking Great White Rock Me.  That was a fucking song.  Started off all nice and fucking quiet and slow.  Right.  And then it fucking rocked.  Rock me.  Whatever happened to those? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, I think they had a slight mishap.  Oops.  Some pyro.  This guy's voice is ridiculous.  You've heard him do the Zeppelin.  Oh, fucking great.  And you're not a big Zeppelin guy.  No.  But he pulls it off.  Because Robert Plant can't.  This guy fucking.  You know, I love this fucking song.  This song is one of my favorite songs.  Really?  Yeah.  This was definitely one of my favorite fucking songs.  This would come on.  Crank this bitch.  Oh, man.  I'd be driving my Chevy Manza. 
[01:26:00]  Coop.  And I'd fucking crank this up.  B.A.B.  The home of rock and roll.  Home of rock and roll would play this.  Ad Nauseam.  Right on.  What did it start?  It's a fucking jam.  Relax.  That's what's great about it.  Everyone's taking their time.  Everyone's in a hurry nowadays.  He knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  It starts.  Very Zeppelin-esque.  The guitar guy is like, all right, come on. 
[01:26:30]  Come on, let's do this.  What do you say, man?  Let's do this.  That's right.  The chicks are looking at us right now.  What a fucking fucking voice on this guy.  Fuck.  Just fucking smooth.  Like silk.  I see a man in here.  He don't care. 
[01:27:00]  Where the night is gone.  Oh, man.  It's going to kick in.  It's going to kick in.  I hope so.  Oh, come on.  Jimmy.  Relax.  You don't like it?  I do like it, but it's not kicking in.  I love that it just builds slowly.  But then it doesn't kick in there.  No, it just goes back.  It goes back down.  Hey, man.  It's fucking.  They know what they're doing?  Relax.  They're jamming.  Yeah.  Like the dead.  No.  I love the dead.  This has fucking got great sound to it.  It's not that fucking.  Oh, okay. 
[01:27:30]  Now, see?  Look.  Get a little fucking kick drum.  Comes in.  It's a dynamic song, Jimmy.  It's a slow build.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fucking rock me. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, a little air guitar.  That's right, man.  Hope he gave up the keyboards.  Oh, yeah.  Not bad I want to just jam in front of your wife again, how uncomfortable she was.  We can set that up.  Oh, it was my favorite moment of the month.  That's great.  Give me some Zeppelin by Great White.  Oh, my God.  He sings fucking Zeppelin better than Zeppelin, Zeppelin. 
[01:28:30]  I think he did since I've been loving you, I think.  Oh, my God.  I think.  What do you got on the Great White Zeppelin thing?  Do you hear what happened with Great White?  At the club?  Oh, yeah.  This is live.  This is live.  Unlike the audience over there in, where was it, Rhode Island?  We have a studio version of this?  Because I think they put out a whole Zeppelin album.  Oh, man.  That's crazy.  I think.  The live stuff is rough sometimes on the YouTube. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know if we have a...  Oh, my God.  No?  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  No?  No?  All right.  We'll go with the live version.  Is that it?  Uh-oh.  What happened, Sam?  Oh, boy.  Come on, Sam.  Old sabotage Sam is back at it.  Exactly.  All right.  We'll just go with the live version.  All right.  Oh, God. 
[01:29:30]  This will take a while.  It's a great song, though.  Look at that keyboard player's hair.  I thought there was a woman.  It's a poodle.  Old people were right.  They did look like girls back then.  Yes.  Jesus.  What was this?  The Ritz.  1988.  See, I'm giving you content.  Like Denny says to give.  Yeah, give them a little.  But not in the middle of the song.  Yeah, that's a good voice. 
[01:30:00]  That's the fucking congested sound.  Give them a little background content.  You've got to give them some content.  Give them a little content.  Yes.  Give them a little bit of background information.  This isn't the one I was thinking of, though.  He sounds like Robert Plant.  Yeah.  But when Robert Plant can't sound like Robert Plant, you need somebody else that can.  Are they still touring, Craig White?  Or did they just say, fuck it, and wake up in cold sweats at three in the morning? 
[01:30:30]  Fucking breathing heavy and thinking of the bodies.  Didn't one of them die in the fire, too?  I don't think so.  No, no, no.  I think they got out.  We've got to acknowledge that was just a fucking horrific situation.  Oh, my God.  Obviously.  I saw footage from the outside of that building burning.  Yeah.  And you could see people piled up at the door.  It was so fucking horrible. 
[01:31:00]  It just has a great fucking voice.  Yeah.  There's no, you know, what are you going to say?  People saying it's, babe, I'm going to leave you is the big one.  That's the one.  Okay, do we have that?  Babe, babe, babe.  Do we have the studio version?  No, fuck.  I thought they put this on a CD or something.  Right, white, babe.  I'm going to leave you.  They did one unplugged, right?  But we don't need the unplugged version. 
[01:31:30]  Well, maybe we do.  Yeah, this really shows, like, how insane this is.  He hits every fucking note that Robert Plant was never able to hit.  I would love to see the studio fucking takes of Plant trying to do it.  He needs some conditioner.  The great white guy.  Yeah.  His hair looks like it's been in a fun...  Oh.  He looks like one of the way outs from the Flintstones.  He would swear this is Robert Plant. 
[01:32:00]  It's better than Plant.  I'll tell you the truth.  I know.  You know I'm going to leave you...  Yeah, the inflections are all there.  Holy fuck.  You would lose a lot of money.  You would say, oh, Robert Plant.  Yeah.  I'll leave you in the summertime.  Yeah.  Leave you when the summer comes along.  Ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[01:32:30]  Leave you when the summer comes along.  Oh, yeah.  I hope he's fucking air guitaring.  Jesus.  You're rocking.  Thank you, man.  How is this unplugged?  Yeah.  The drummer sounds like John Bodlum, though.  Bodlum bass.  It is effortless. 
[01:33:00]  Unbelievable.  What's his name?  I forgot his name.  The great white guy.  Great white guy.  Thank you.  He's a good dude, too.  I interviewed him years ago.  Did you?  At P.A.B., yeah.  Cool.  Listen to these fucking notes.  Wow.  Listen to this.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[01:33:30]  How do you do that?  Easy.  Jesus.  That's fucking crazy.  But he is really not putting any effort.  It's fucking amazing, this guy.  They also had a video on MTV that had one of the hottest fucking girls I'd ever seen in  a video.  To this day, I fucking think about how hot that fucking girl was. 
[01:34:00]  Third Eye Blind?  No.  What?  I bet you if we look at it now, you wouldn't think so.  I know, because I haven't seen it in that.  This is all 80s up.  Has all that 80s shit up.  What was their big fucking hit in the 80s?  What was it?  Come on.  No?  Anyone?  Listen to that. 
[01:34:30]  Once, Bitten, Twice, Shy.  Thank you.  Let me see the video.  Find Once, Bitten, Twice, Shy and go full screen, because I want to see this girl.  Let me see the girl in my mouth.  He fucking...  All right.  Let's see.  It's the blonde girl.  Was it the Bobby Broad?  No.  It's not the Bobby Broad.  I forgot her last name.  Does she look like Tina Yathers from season one of Family Ties? 
[01:35:00]  Yes, exactly.  You're saying one of the hottest broads ever, right here.  In music videos.  Okay.  Yes.  Okay, sir.  Oh, wait.  No, that was the singer.  Oh.  We're...  Look at these chicks.  Oh, my God.  Jack Russell.  Thank you, Ray in Georgia.  Jack Russell Terrier.  Look at that ass.  He's looking at fucking Sam. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  A little honky-tonk piano.  By the way, the great white lead guitarist did die on the fire.  No, did he?  Yeah.  Wow.  Really?  I don't remember that.  I knew one of the band members died.  It's terrible.  All right.  Where are the chicks?  I know they start, like, singing backup with them or something during the chorus.  I hope my fantasy isn't fucking ruined. 
[01:36:00]  Where's the chick?  Oh, right there.  That was her on the bike.  Fuck.  There is she.  Oh, I'm ready to jack off.  Now we're just listening to music.  I know.  Fuck it.  Bring on the chicks.  Oh, wow.  Show her, like, in a quick flash.  I think that's the Bobby Broad. 
[01:36:30]  What?  Is it?  She was in a few videos.  Yeah?  I think she might have been in the Cherry Pie video, too.  No.  First video, Hope.  Oh, man.  Are you kidding?  She got around.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I believe so.  Come on, already.  They barely show her in this video.  No, no, I remember they show her.  She's, like, dancing around.  I remember.  I swear I do.  I'm obsessing.  You used to watch these videos.  They're waiting.  I used to watch this video just to see her. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, man.  And then ZZ Top would come on, and you'd have the ZZ Top girls.  Those videos got a little fucking tedious.  We get it.  Shark Trish Man was good, though.  Got your little car and your fucking chicks and the keychain.  They had a theme.  Yeah.  Oh, now the girls come up.  He just waved the girls up.  Oh, here we go.  Look at these chicks.  The jeans are up too high, though.  Shut up.  She's got a wedgie.  Oh, God.  Look at her.  She was the one on the right with the tits. 
[01:37:30]  Look at her.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  She's pretty.  Oh, my God.  She was.  Yeah.  She's a disaster now.  Oh, my God.  The jeans wedgie I could do without, though.  She's got that studded black fucking top on, and her big fucking pits were, like, screaming.  Is she Bobby Brown from the Cherry Pie video, too?  I think so.  Better not be.  What?  Do a Google image on the Bobby Brown. 
[01:38:00]  Although you remind me of Bobby Brown, the Zapper song.  What?  You remember that?  No.  That's a good one.  Sorry.  That's a good one.  Is it?  Okay.  I'll have to.  I don't know that one.  Oh, that's not Bobby Brown.  You're going to have a hard time finding Bobby Brown, because it's going to be Bobby Brown.  Yes.  What is that?  That's another Bobby Brown.  I wish you were like Bobby Brown's ex-wife.  Wasn't it Bobby Brown?  What was her name?  I don't know.  Maybe it's spelled with a fucking Y.  No, it's spelled with an I. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Maybe it's spelled with one B.  I think it's an I.  Put fucking Cherry Pie video, you fucking cretin.  Why are you getting so upset?  Because you fucking do this because you're upset about fucking Troy Kwan.  Because you got us in trouble with Ron and Fez, man.  Exactly.  Fuck.  All right.  There she is.  Let's see.  That's not her.  What?  That's not her.  What do you mean it's not her?  It's not the same girl.  Not the same girl.  All right.  Go Great White.  Great White fucking once bitten, twice shy girls.  Once bitten, twice shy girls. 
[01:39:00]  No, just Great White video girls.  Come on, Sam.  What are you doing?  It's not spelling wrong.  Video girl.  Yeah.  Well, how come she shows up again?  Because it's the same broad.  No.  I'm telling you, it's the same broad.  No.  She's probably fucking over.  Oh, God.  Look at her.  See?  Right?  The one all the way to the right.  Those fucking tits.  Maybe on the left.  Not the one on the right.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  No, I don't even know why we're doing this.  Exactly.  Weren't we going to do John Tober? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, we're looking for a fucking six.  We're looking for a six.  Fucking when fucking Reagan was still in office.  Yes.  All right.  Well, fuck it.  I think it's time to take a break.  Oh, Christ.  I don't think we got.  I found Bobby Brown.  What?  I found Bobby Brown.  Yeah?  B-O-B-B-I-E.  B-O-B-B-I-E.  Put B-O-B-B-I-E, Brown.  And we'll get a lot of Google Images popping up.  B-O-B-I-E.  There you go.  She won Miss Louisiana Teen USA. 
[01:40:00]  Well, she sure did.  In 1987.  Oh, boy.  She's 43 now.  Oh, Christ almighty.  Well.  That time is a bitch.  Yes, it is.  I think it's the same girl.  I don't think it's the same girl from fucking.  I think it's the same girl.  She was the cherry pie girl.  Was she married to fucking Lainey?  Yes.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  And was she in the other video?  Janie?  Whatever his name is.  Same broad, right?  I don't think so. 
[01:40:30]  I don't think so.  No, it doesn't say so.  It says she was.  Who was the other broad?  She was in the video for cherry pie, and she was on the cover of the album.  I don't know.  Very upset.  I don't want to know who that other girl is.  Why?  Because I want to remember her as she was with her big teeth.  You don't want to know what she looks like now?  No.  Why?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Fuck it.  All right.  And I think it's time to do Jocktober for today.  Yes.  And we got Paul Williams coming in, and the keyboard is set up, so. 
[01:41:00]  Cool.  I hope he plays.  What do you mean?  Did he say he was going to?  I don't give a fuck what he says.  Yeah.  You could call him right now and say, I know you're coming in in an hour and a half, but  we want you to play.  Oh, no.  Just be prepared.  It's not a bad idea, Sam Roberts.  Just cold call him.  I hope he's...  Not a bad idea.  I don't know why I still haven't put him in my phone.  He's not in your phone?  No, it's still on this dumb card.  It's kind of the fun of it. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know why I didn't put him in my phone.  And then if he doesn't pick up, leave him a voicemail that says, hey.  See, if you tell him now, he's got a reason to go, I can't, but if it's just there, he  wants to tell him.  You don't ask.  You tell him.  Right.  Just so you know.  That sounded like that long ring before a message picks up.  Really?  Tony.  Paul Williams.  This is me.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:42:00]  How are you?  Hi, Mr. Williams.  I'm going to see you guys in about, what, an hour, I think, huh?  Yes.  And we got a request, so we want you to be prepared for it.  Okay.  This is very considerate.  What happened, you guys?  What happened?  What's the request?  We got a keyboard set up in the studio, sir.  We want to just sing for an hour.  Well, here's the only problem.  I don't play piano. 
[01:42:30]  You don't.  Oh, see.  I write on it.  I sit there and I'll search for chords and write on it, you know.  But that's why I spend all that money taking a band on the road with me.  Wow.  If I can play, I can't play.  Oh, shit.  That's amazing.  I mean, I can probably stumble or find the chords to old-fashioned love song, and that's literally  about it.  Everything that I write, I write it in my head.  I go to the piano, I find the chords, write them down, go into this video, give the chords 
[01:43:00]  to the musician, they play it, and then I'm done.  I move on to the next song.  That's pretty...  Just because you can train a horse doesn't mean you can write it, you know.  That's amazing.  Oh, well...  That's pretty amazing, sir.  I would still love to hear you stumble through old-fashioned love song.  Yeah, now it makes it even better that you can't play the piano.  We're really going to have a good time.  Did you say that again?  I said, it makes it better that you can't play the piano.  We'll really have a good time now. 
[01:43:30]  It's absolutely perfect, you know.  It's like a chance, you know, like, what better chance than, you know, like, to be absolutely  old Thumbs Williams, you know.  And those bad notes, you know, floating around the world.  We'll work it out this morning, but yeah, I don't play the piano.  All right, we'll harmonize some shit.  We'll do some acapella.  Why not?  Exactly.  Acapella is us.  We can do some church choir stuff.  All right, we'll do it, man.  We're looking for...  Who's the love boat?  I tweeted about it the other day that I said, I want to get back in there near Opie, so 
[01:44:00]  you're near the love boat.  Yeah, the love boat.  Who was that invitating me?  Was that you, Opie?  No, that was Anthony.  Anthony does a great impression of you.  I give you credit for...  Anthony, you do a pretty good Paul Williams impression.  I've been doing a Paul Williams impression for my family and whatnot for...  ...probably 40 years.  Looking back when they sounded like the D after D...  I love that.  The love...  So what we're going to do this morning is have the old Paul Williams interview the new Paul 
[01:44:30]  Williams, and I can tell the old Paul Williams what a total fuck-up he was.  I like it.  I do, too.  You know, hey, listen, it's cutting-edge radio.  I mean, it's not...  Yes.  I love it.  Me, too.  I'm looking forward to it, guys.  I really appreciate it.  I'll see you in a little while.  All right, Mr. Williams.  All right.  I love you, miss you.  There he is.  Paul, I love you, miss you.  I love you, miss you.  That is the most insincere fucking sign-off. 
[01:45:00]  That's when he was leaving voicemails for people.  For Barry Williams and Paul Williams and Andy Williams.  No, Barry didn't call back again.  Oh, what an asshole.  Fuck him.  We got Paul Williams.  I don't know where it went wrong with that one.  One Williams per fucking show.  Probably you showed up at his house and ate bologna.  Maybe that was it.  Called him from the driveway.  Never really gone.  Does anyone play piano around here?  Because maybe we could have someone play the piano for Mr. Williams.  Yeah, he plays.  But they have to know fucking Paul Williams songs.  I don't know. 
[01:45:30]  I'll ask.  Yeah, ask around.  Like an old-fashioned love song.  The love boat soon will be making another run.  All right, very exciting.  Paul Williams on the way.  But, of course, we're going to do Jack-tober first.  Stay there.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  Mysterious XM.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  All right. 
[01:46:00]  So we got a keyboard in studio, but we got a guy that doesn't play keyboards coming in.  We got a problem.  Who knew?  Who knew Paul Williams didn't play a keyboard?  I'm more amazed he can write songs like that without being able to play the piano.  That's more amazing to me.  He just knows, like, some chords.  I bet you he knows his way around a piano and actually can play it, but he doesn't want to officially say he plays the piano.  You got to think, right?  Yeah.  He's been in music his entire life.  I think he could get something done with that thing. 
[01:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  We'll see.  I know I've seen him on shows, though, where they have him behind the piano playing.  I could swear I've seen that.  Well, he'll...  And maybe they film him like...  He'll probably have a story to tell.  Yeah, maybe.  All right.  I think it's time.  What do you think?  Is it time?  It certainly is.  I do believe.  I do believe.  I believe.  Government shut down. 
[01:47:00]  Day two.  Fuck you.  I realized yesterday when I was fucking sitting out by my pool sipping a cocktail.  I'm like, who gives a shit?  Well...  Ah, government shut down.  Oh, another cocktail, please.  Well, everyone thought the government would shut down and then anarchy would start, but  here's my question.  How many days does it take before you start seeing things?  Noticing things get a little ragged around the edges?  Not going to see things day one, day two.  You probably would go an easy week.  Yeah.  What day? 
[01:47:30]  When does it start getting fuzzy?  I would say 10 days in.  10 days is when...  What happens after 10 days?  There's something that happens.  Oh.  Where something shuts down.  Oh, the FAA stays open.  Yeah, they all stay open.  But there's something that doesn't.  Yeah, but, you know...  Like, they closed down the national parks.  Oh, look out.  Well, um...  The vet said, fuck you.  Yeah, yeah, the World War II monument.  What a great, great video.  We're going in.  A great thing.  They said, yeah, really?  And they moved the barriers that they set up because it's closed. 
[01:48:00]  Said, you're not stopping us.  And who in their right mind is going to stop a World War II vet when he decides, no, we're  going to...  This thing is open today.  They'll let him open it.  Fucking love those guys.  Yeah.  And then...  Storm Normandy, they can get in a fucking park.  Exactly.  Fucking animals.  I love it.  And then the, um...  Obviously, uh...  The post office, the biggest money-losing proposition the government has, is, uh...  Which...  Is still working. 
[01:48:30]  Which tells you everything you need to know about our government.  Yeah.  They can't figure out the post office.  Yeah.  Well, it's because of all the, uh...  The fucking retirement things they have to honor.  All the, uh...  They just can't figure it out.  That amazes me.  Yeah.  Gets to the point where...  Yeah.  Post office, um...  You know, I only check my mail once a month from now.  Do you?  Yeah.  They're getting really mad at my building because they have to, like, start piling it up somewhere  else.  Because I don't want to deal with all the fucking crap you get down.  You go paperless bills. 
[01:49:00]  You go auto pay through your bank account.  There's plenty of things where the only thing that shows up in your fucking mailbox are,  like, fucking Pottery Barn catalogs.  From those assholes that say, no, we're not going to send you anything.  We just need...  Yeah.  And I go, no, you can send me something.  You're liars.  Yeah.  So, no, I don't want to give you my address or my phone number or any of that shit.  You're just lying to me now.  I never do, dude.  Because I go, please don't send me...  Oh, we're not going to do that, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  I got fucking huge catalogs. 
[01:49:30]  What a waste of fucking paper and time and...  Yeah.  ...and money for these companies.  Who the fuck sits there and looks through a catalog?  It's ridiculous.  If you do give a fuck about a company, you go on their website and you check out the shit  that way.  You're not going old school and looking at a catalog that they mail to you.  It just makes me so mad that I don't want to shop there.  You should just go to the fucking post office and tell the guy, look, I want you to stop  delivering mail at my house.  Just stop.  Just fucking stop.  Please.  Please just stop. 
[01:50:00]  And see what happens.  We're blind to their tyranny.  It's unbelievable, though.  Just the junk mail is just out of control.  I know.  Out of fucking control.  Fucking...  This motorcycle thing is still hot, huh?  They're arresting people now?  Good.  I bet the postmaster general wouldn't like that.  You know, they said on the news what we said.  Yeah.  You got to pull some GTA shit if you're in that situation.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you're being chased by motorcycles.  Ray Kelly pretty much said, yeah, you got to run over people. 
[01:50:30]  In that circumstance, you run over people to save your life and your family's life.  And then the news people were like, yeah, you got to pull...  They didn't say GTA shit, but they said you got to stay on the highway.  We all know that in the GTA games.  And they said you got to get the attention of the cops.  So you know what that means?  You got to fucking speed or start hitting shit or going through tollboots without paying.  Yeah, like a fucking maniac.  Drive crazy and then all of a sudden the police are on you.  You get some stars on there and the cops come and chase you and...  And then you end that problem that you have. 
[01:51:00]  You don't get off the highway into traffic-filled roadway.  His tire was flat.  He had to because they slashed his tire.  I think because he couldn't drive.  Drive on the flat.  I agree.  Again, GTA.  GTA, you can fucking drive on that flat.  I've had the cops throw those spike strips out.  I keep fucking driving.  Old school.  I'm crazy like that.  Your car starts smoking old school GTA.  You can figure it out in your head.  Like, you know what?  I could go a little further before it's going to burst into flames.  A little further.  And then you fucking get out and hope the motorcycles surround it when it blows up.  Right.  And then you watch them fly and then you fucking run some more. 
[01:51:30]  One punch.  Right.  Knock him off his motorcycle.  And then like we said yesterday, you got to find a ramp immediately.  But your wife and kid are in there.  Hey, you can hold a kid with one arm, have a fucking wrap her arms around you.  We throw the kid out the window and it distracts them.  Go for a stunt bonus.  Stunt bonus.  Ruled.  Oh my God.  Is that fucking Dinkins?  What a fatso he is.  Oh Jesus.  Look at him with his dumbo tie.  He doesn't look that bad actually.  Oh, he looks huge though.  Look how fat he is.  He is a big boy.  When they pull back on him, you can see he put out like 35 pounds.  Really? 
[01:52:00]  But he disappeared from fucking life.  Yeah, he's had enough.  You think?  Oh yeah.  He sucked.  New York sucked.  Big Apple crime control under Dinkins.  A bite out of crime.  Big Apple crime control under Dinkins.  Dinkins was terrible.  It's like some of the most violent times in fucking New York.  He was a law and order guy.  Yeah.  And he liked to watch it, I mean.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  The washroom attendant mayor.  Oh boy, did Bob Grant hate this.  The tennis mayor. 
[01:52:30]  The mayor of tennis.  Oh boy, he hated him.  Yes, he did.  Now we're going to have the same thing.  De Blasio.  Someone makes a good point.  Does someone know the answer to this?  Why would the government shut down things that take in revenue?  Like national parks and stuff.  The answer is because they're stupid.  Well, not national parks.  Those are free, obviously.  Sorry.  I don't know.  I think because they got to lay off the employees.  They fucking.  Right.  Nothing the government does makes money.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  They're furloughing a bunch of fucking employees.  NASA, I guess.  FBI.  I guess I said Nassau instead of NASA yesterday and that drove people nuts.  Oh, really?  Nassau.  I'll acknowledge I got your hate tweets, okay?  I'm going to.  There.  I acknowledged it.  Paradise Island.  NASA.  You really?  I just said NASA.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I know it's NASA.  Sometimes we fucking say the wrong words. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But over and over again.  So maybe if I acknowledge it, the guy will just stop.  Yes, I knew.  Right when I was done.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid. 
[01:54:00]  Jocktober.  Hosts.  Holes.  Bits.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  I got a tree on my house.  Do, do, do, do.  Woo.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Do, do, do.  I certainly hope this does not involve any type of fugitive bit. 
[01:54:30]  Hmm.  Oh.  People are saying that the guy in the Range Rover was the asshole in that situation.  Why?  They're probably motorcyclists.  Those are the people that are saying the guy's an asshole.  No.  Hold on.  He's got a wife and kid in the car that he's surrounded by thugs.  Well, let's see what this.  He fucking went.  Let's see what Alan has to say in Florida.  Go ahead, Alan.  Before we get to Jocktober.  What's up, buddy?  What's your take on this?  Well, my take on it is when you see the video, it starts where you see the one guy who's obviously 
[01:55:00]  pissed off, stops in front of a Range Rover, and then the Range Rover proceeds to hit him.  So I'm thinking that something happened before that.  The Range Rover must have pulled a shit move to make that guy pissed off.  They said, here's the reports I heard.  Because we don't have all the video, right?  Earlier, before the video picks up, the biker said the Range Rover cut off one of the motorcyclists.  Probably.  Now, he might have.  Even if he did, that isn't a good idea for one of the motorcyclists to then stop short 
[01:55:30]  in front of the fucking Range Rover so he hits him.  First of all, he's distracted as fuck.  Secondly, he's Asian.  And he hits the fucking biker in front of him.  He hits his back wheel.  Then when he gets surrounded by these guys, what the fuck is he supposed to do at that  point?  The thing is, when the guy stops short in front of him, take your fucking brakes.  Well, why would a dummy on a motorcycle fucking stop short in front of a two-ton vehicle? 
[01:56:00]  And they weren't an asshole.  And everyone knows.  Hold on.  Everyone knows these guys do this every year, and they're not going for just an innocent  joy ride.  Right.  They're all about creating some havoc.  Right.  Within limits.  Like, their whole goal is to take over Times Square every year, I guess.  Yeah, this wasn't just a bunch of fun bikers having a good ride out.  They were fucking around.  They constantly do this.  They break the law.  They intimidate drivers.  They fuck up traffic. 
[01:56:30]  Fuck them.  Have you ever rode a motorcycle, Anthony?  I rode a minibike.  That's true.  But you're not acknowledging the part where these guys definitely were, you know, fucking  around.  Of course they were fucking around.  That's what you do.  Okay.  Hey, Ed.  Motorcyclists don't get carte blanche to fuck off and then be treated like saints.  I understand.  When there's a motorcyclist on the road, I give them more distance.  I don't fuck around when they're trying to pass me.  I move over a little bit.  I'll treat them like gold because I know they're very fragile out there. 
[01:57:00]  But if they're acting like assholes, then they're going to get what fucking comes to  them.  Fuck them.  I understand that.  But you know what?  I see a lot of people that treat them like assholes.  I don't go over there and punch them in the face just to act like an asshole.  I act like an asshole sometimes.  You act like an asshole sometimes.  It doesn't mean people have the right to run us off.  If everyone drove like me, we'd all love it.  Get home quicker.  We don't be drunk.  Enjoy ourselves.  Drunk.  We don't be drunk.  All right, Alan. 
[01:57:30]  I know you're sticking up for your fellow motorcycle guys there.  But I mean.  They were being dicks.  But they acknowledge that the whole thing is they're kind of dicks.  Yeah.  They're kind of intimidating.  You got a few hundred of them at the same time.  They take over Times Square.  I saw them go down Broadway.  It was an amazing sight to see.  It was pretty fucking cool.  But they were going through every light and everything.  They just took over the entire fucking road.  And then you got some of these guys that are going to fool around and kind of intimidate other drivers. 
[01:58:00]  We know that.  These aren't Hells Angels.  You know.  No, they're worse.  They're fucking worse.  Hells Angels ride all nice.  What they do on their fucking.  What they do on their off the road time is a different story.  But when they're riding.  Hells Angels guys are very respectable when they're on the road fucking riding their bikes.  These guys are a bunch of thugs on crotch rockets being assholes.  What color were these guys on the crotch rockets?  A lot of black guys and Hispanic guys. 
[01:58:30]  Anyway.  What does that mean?  The videos we've seen.  They've been mostly black guys.  That.  Oh, right.  Well.  It's a beautiful thing.  But, you know, I understand that, you know.  All right.  Hold on.  We got Debbie.  Hold on.  Debbie.  Debbie rides.  Debbie.  She rides a motorcycle.  Go ahead, Debbie.  You're on with Alan.  She rides on the back.  I do not ride on the back.  I've been riding for 20 years.  You ride bitch.  You ride bitch.  You have not been riding for 20 years. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, I have.  No, you haven't.  Debbie, it's Debbie the cop.  Yeah.  Oh, hi, Debbie.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Debbie.  Go ahead, Debbie.  You got Alan.  I got to acknowledge a lot of guys that ride bikes are pretty much calling what happened.  You know, those guys are a bunch of twats, so.  Those guys are a bunch of fucking assholes, and I would have done the same thing or shot one of them.  Honestly.  Yep, exactly. 
[01:59:30]  That's what I was saying.  I would have shot one of them because my wife and my kid's wife is at stake.  When you have, yeah, when you have some guy breaking your driver's side window with a fucking motorcycle helmet,  a crowd of these guys around you, they're pissed off at you, and your wife and kid in the car,  if you're armed, you fucking shove that thing right up his fucking nose.  Absolutely.  He didn't take it to the car until he plowed through them.  He fucking plowed over these people.  Yeah, because he didn't want to get dragged out of his vehicle. 
[02:00:00]  They surrounded him.  They surrounded him.  Wait.  They were surrounding him.  He was going to be the new Reginald Denny.  Dude, they were.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  They were menacing him.  I'd love to see how this guy would handle it.  He'd sit there.  Now. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  Anybody.  He would have been safe.  The motorcycles would have passed him.  Yeah.  He should have rolled his window down and waved his hand.  This is not the Asian you're looking for.  This is not what you think it is.  Those are a bunch of assholes on Crotch Rockets.  They were riding quads illegally.  They were riding just out of control and dangerously.  They were a danger.  And what happened to them, I'm surprised it's not happening more often.  You know what?  Bullshit. 
[02:01:00]  I mean, people, I live in Florida now.  I used to live in New York.  I lived in New York for fucking 40 years.  I live in Florida now.  And no matter where I am, there's fucking assholes on the road.  Even on my bicycle.  You're just not being realistic.  You're trying to stick to your point, dude.  Yeah, you're misreading this situation.  They were menacing him.  They were fucking with this guy.  Those guys were menacing everyone.  Supposedly, Rebecca's on the line.  She said that there were over 200 911 calls.  Nobody calls me Rebecca.  It wasn't like the guy was just driving, running into them. 
[02:01:30]  They surrounded his car probably doing 50.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  They brought him to a stop.  Hey, fish man.  And they intimidated him and harassed him.  Not said.  What are you supposed to do?  Yeah.  So why are you just assuming that it's happening instead of assuming what everyone else is saying  is what happened?  No one is saying that.  Everyone is saying they were fucking with the guy. 
[02:02:00]  They ride in these giant groups.  They go around you.  They go slow.  And even if he did something which was bad or he cut somebody off, even if he did cut  somebody off, you don't fucking jump in front of him with 50 guys around him and fucking  jam on the brakes.  What do you want him to do?  Yeah, we're not...  I agree.  That was a stupid thing to do on that guy's part.  We jammed the brakes in front of him.  But if that happened, he shouldn't have fucking clawed through the rest of them.  What should he have done?  What should he have done when they surrounded him?  What should he have done with a wife and kid in the car? 
[02:02:30]  Thank you.  We're not talking about...  One of the guys got off the brakes and started coming towards him.  Yeah.  That was the moment that he ran the other guy over.  So what should he have done, sir?  He should have stayed in his car.  Uh-huh.  If he would have stayed in his car with his windows closed and not...  Yeah, because that helped when they broke the window open and dragged him out.  And by the way, when he took off, dude, they were slashing his tires and smashing his car with their helmets. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, that was after he ran over the other motorcycles because he was being threatened.  No, no.  That was before.  He took off.  Dude, he took off.  They were fucking hitting his car.  They were slashing his tires.  He broke one of their legs, taking off in a panic.  Right.  And then he kept driving and his tires started going flat.  So then they got him off the highway, and that's where they dragged him out and beat the shit out of him.  Before they did that, they had stopped him, and they were damaging his car, and they were slashing his tires. 
[02:03:30]  That's why he panicked.  He didn't just do that on the road for no reason.  And he's got a hundred of his friends, too, that are pissed off.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  You're just full of shit, dude.  You're full of shit.  All right, Alan.  Thank you.  This guy would have done the same thing, by the way.  He's just trying to stick to his point.  All right.  You don't know what you're talking about.  They were fucking attacking his car.  And this guy's going, he should have just sat there instead of driving over them?  If he was in a vehicle where that was happening, that guy, he would have done the same thing. 
[02:04:00]  Of course.  He'd have hit the gas.  Of course.  And tried to escape.  We're not talking about 10 and 2s here.  No.  Those guys are not 10 and 2 drivers.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They all went into it knowing, we're going to have some fucking fun today.  I'm even suspect that the Range Rover cut someone off.  He may have, but in the situation, yeah, I know.  Yeah.  In the situation that you have hundreds of motorcycles around you, you know, you probably have no choice but to cut somebody off.  It's always intimidating when you get in that situation where you've got a whole bunch of guys on bikes around you on the highway. 
[02:04:30]  And you do try to, you know, be as safe as possible.  Yeah.  But now they're cutting you off.  They're going in between the two lanes doing all their shit.  Dr. Steve said, Jesse Ventura just said, Obama was a CIA operative before he became president.  The guy's a fucking nut.  Obama, a CIA operative.  Was he?  It's a false flag operation.  Oh, God.  Would you have him back, Jim? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, in a second.  I would have him back.  I could care less if he comes or if he doesn't come.  Give him a fuck.  He's welcome back, though.  I don't care if he comes, stays, lays, or prays.  My toes are still tapping.  He's the one that doesn't want to come back.  A lot of people saying those bike guys were assholes.  They are assholes.  A lot of guys that drive bikes, by the way.  So, hey, it's time for Jocktober.  Sorry about that.  Of course.  So, we're going to Atlanta today.  Hot Atlanta.  Oh, boy.  That's a major market in the South.  A town down. 
[02:05:30]  One that Opie and I almost ended up in.  Well, it was, you know, told to us that it's just like New York.  Just like New York.  It's mini New York.  If you move to Buckhead, you get yourself a nice house.  Yep.  And you deal with the utter, utter savagery of Atlanta.  And then you go home to your suburbs.  Well, I don't know if you would have done well in Atlanta, quite frankly, because there's  a lot of radio competition out there.  A lot of competition in the mornings.  Mm-hmm.  I like going after the bigger market shows, because they should know better.  Absolutely.  Because a lot of times, they've been around a while. 
[02:06:00]  Going market to market.  Yeah, where they've moved up in their careers to the big leagues.  I travel around Atlanta today.  If you see me, don't push me away.  Oh, God, don't.  Yuck.  No.  Fuck you.  Stupid fugitive.  No.  I wish.  Oh, no.  Would you do another fugitive bit?  No.  If he does, he's out.  I would do, if we had 30 days of Jack Tober, if it were possible, I'd do 30 fugitive bits. 
[02:06:30]  Whew.  It's the same bit.  Yeah.  I know.  I would only do, I would do, I will continue to do fugitive bits.  We didn't even get to hear the morning hot tub.  I don't even know what they sound like.  I know.  They call themselves the morning hot tub.  That was yesterday.  You're just hanging out in a hot tub with the morning show.  Today, we're going to get to hear the hosts.  Oh, today, it's all about the hosts.  What are we looking at?  We're looking at Star 94.  Yeah.  In Atlanta.  Yeah.  Today's hit without, today's hits without the rap. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, they don't like black people.  Your life and your music is another one of their slug lines.  I love that thing.  Your life and your music.  Your life and your music.  You think that's a good slug line?  Oh, God.  What does that mean?  Today's hits without the rap.  Yeah.  It's Star 94.  It's Cindy and Jimmy in the morning.  Cindy and Jimmy.  That's right.  Oh, is it one of these, they kind of make believe they could be married?  Like a couple?  Well, they have other families outside of this. 
[02:07:30]  Like, Cindy talks about being a mom.  Oh, that's nice.  Oh, boy.  And Jimmy, he's just a guy, like, he likes the new GTA game.  Nice.  But you know what?  I bet she keeps him in check.  Well, that comes up.  Oh, right.  They got a sports guy or any of that shit?  They have a tank?  They have producer Casey who's there.  He's a little younger, a little wilder.  Okay, that's good. 
[02:08:00]  A little new blood injected in, kind of a loose cannon.  Yeah, exactly.  That didn't work out well for us.  Oh, Jesus.  Who are you talking about?  What?  You know.  You didn't have anybody named Casey on the show?  I don't know what I'm talking about.  We thought young blood would help us out.  Now you're an old man like us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, you tend to do that to people.  I saw a picture of you and Jimmy.  That picture you posted of you and Jim Norton.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, such a young little Sam.  Let me see it. 
[02:08:30]  Barely a fucking hair on his face.  Now he's got scruffy beard all the time.  Does he look different?  Five o'clock shadow in the morning.  Look at you.  You have the Fred Flintstone mouth.  It's all fucking...  Look, look, look.  That's you?  Look at the fresh-faced little kid.  There's Syracuse, New York, college.  Oh.  Holy shit.  All potential and possibility.  I look better and you look finished.  Look at young Sam. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, that's when Bobby Kelly loved you.  He was on that show.  Very twinkish.  That was the first time I met Jim, the first time I met Bob.  Wow.  And it was Jim, Bob, and Keith Robinson doing the Tough Crowd tour at Syracuse University.  That was up there.  Yeah, that was in Syracuse.  Where was Scorch?  Wait, was this before you were on our show?  Oh, yeah.  Damn.  Look at you.  That's probably 2002 or 2003.  Ew, you've been stalking the show.  You've been stalking us.  What the shit?  Oh, no, I was a listener.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  You knew that.  That's creepy. 
[02:09:30]  Were we on the air then or no?  No.  We weren't on the air yet, dude.  Oh, my God.  He was stalking us.  It was before XM.  How old are you there?  19, 20?  I'm probably like...  Yeah, I'm probably about 20.  20.  Yum.  10 years ago.  That was a fast 10 years, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, the next 10's even quicker.  I accomplished a lot.  Did you?  Yeah.  Well, you kind of did.  I'll give him that.  Yeah.  Certainly don't look at Opie and Anthony with the hero worship I want to stand.  But that's our whole goal around here, because it just makes us uncomfortable. 
[02:10:00]  Reality.  Reality came in pretty quick.  Reality.  I bet you never thought you'd piss off Fez to the extent that you have.  No, I never.  And do vindictive things to him.  You're right.  I never realized I would be such a venomous little prick.  So many things, and that little fucking head of your, that giant head of yours.  That's a terrible person.  He's wearing an Avril Lavigne t-shirt.  I could tell.  Look, Paul Williams is coming in.  We're running out of time.  We'll get back to talking about Sam in a little while.  But first, can we do Jocktober today? 
[02:10:30]  You brought it up.  Don't talk about me all day long.  Star 94.  All right.  So this is one of those things, like some of these radio stations are doing now, they realize that there's some good hit music out there, but their audience is a little older and can't handle the rap thing.  Don't like the black people.  So they love the slug line, today's hits, without the rap.  Without the rap.  Especially in Atlanta.  Oh, yeah.  Atlanta's a big hip-hop town.  You'll get your rap elsewhere.  You ain't getting it here.  Hey, white people, we got radio for you over here. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  We got a lot of those people down there.  That's right, those people.  Whitey, here is your radio station.  Right.  There's more of those people than there are mysterious people, I think, in Atlanta.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, we got Cindy and Jimmy, and it's time for Cindy's Celebrity Dirt.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Throwing the ball around a little bit.  Yeah.  Jesus.  One of the things that makes this show unique is once an hour, they talk about celebrity gossip and give it a clever name with an alliteration. 
[02:11:30]  Oh.  That sounds good.  Clever name.  People are saying phase one is already underway.  Okay.  Well, let's take a look.  We've never encouraged any of this behavior.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What?  Let me see.  Well, the first thing just says, AJ Poopy Shits posted a photo.  Gregorio Hughes posted a photo.  Gregorio Hughes.  Dave Freed posted a photo.  And then one under that just says, uh-oh, okay.  There's one that says, Jim Chandler is a cuckold. 
[02:12:00]  Leave him alone.  Picture of Greg the Hammer Valentine in a bellhop outfit from the ICP theater.  Right.  Picture of an animated E-Rock Nagel riding his refrigerator.  Oh, yeah.  It's a Coke Logic classic.  Oh, my boy.  Why is Troy Kwan taking a black penis?  It's a picture of Troy Kwan taking a black penis.  It says, Rocket, bro.  Yeah, it says, Rocket, bro.  I think we need Troy to come in here and defeat somebody.  No, no, no.  That's not right.  He doesn't want to bring it up.  What?  He doesn't want to talk about that stuff. 
[02:12:30]  Sure.  Yeah, he's good.  Oh, my God.  So many folks in the picture.  Terry Clifford.  I have one request.  Yeah.  It makes those Rochester trips really tough.  Can we lay off her this shit?  There's no fucking way we're laying off her.  No way.  We just begged me.  You have to.  Because he runs in the same circles as that planet.  Oh, God.  That's a big circle.  Yeah.  I will put that.  Yes, he doesn't run in the circle.  He goes around the event horizon.  I will put the no Terry Clifford request in the same category as the no fugitive request. 
[02:13:00]  That's the pay no mind list.  Let's get into Cindy and Jimmy.  Star 94.  Time for Cindy's celebrity dirt.  Star 94 mornings with Cindy and Jimmy at 610.  You saved the drama for your mama.  So go get her.  Quick.  Whoa.  Watch out.  Wow.  Save the drama for your mama.  That's a good one.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Is that a diagram to perform a late-term abortion? 
[02:13:30]  Jesus.  Why are they boasting?  It's disgusting.  Why would this radio station do that?  Holy fuck.  I don't know what promotions they have going on.  It's crazy.  Look for your mama.  So go get her.  Quick.  Mom!  It's time for Cindy's celebrity dirt on Star 94 mornings.  Funny.  No, baby.  Oh, brother.  Oh, here it is.  Let's kick it.  So, Ice Ice, baby. 
[02:14:00]  Welcome to 1992, ladies and gentlemen.  I could listen to this song all day.  All right, stop.  Collaborate and listen.  I'm back with a brand new invention something.  Grab the hold of me tightly.  Close like a harpoon daily and nightly.  Will it ever stop?  Yo.  I don't know.  Turn off the lights.  And I'll go.  Do the extreme.  I'll rock a muck like a vandal.  Light up the stage and watch a choke like a candle.  Okay.  I made such a mistake.  I don't know where you thought you could play that.  I thought no rap.  What happened?  Yeah, they're rapping.  They're rapping.  They're off the bat.  They say no rap. 
[02:14:30]  There's vanilla ice.  They're fucking hilarious.  You like them, Chippa?  Fuck yeah.  You were laughing right with them at the end.  Bam, burn.  Ah.  Shooky, ducky, crack, crack.  So, is it just rap?  Yes, it is.  They say no rap and then their first thing was rap.  That's pissing off to pee once.  Oh, yeah.  That's like saying you don't like the word crazy, but then you use the word insane in the sentence.  To illustrate your argument?  Right.  Right.  Who would do that?  That's stupid.  I don't know.  It's dumb.  Sam. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  So, that's a good start right there for their show.  Well, they're freewheeling.  You know what I mean?  It's like if they fall into something that's fun and organic.  Riffin'.  Maybe they'll take 30 seconds off the news so they can rap the first verse of Ice Ice Baby.  I like it.  I like it so far.  My version goes dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.  See, the original version went dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Mine goes dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. 
[02:15:30]  It's different.  It's not the same.  Didn't he pretty much just admit to us it was all bullshit in the end?  It was all fucking bullshit.  He ripped the goddamn song.  And then didn't he say, in the end, I just bought that song anyway or something?  Yeah, but then everybody said he was lying.  Yeah, I think he probably was.  He's coming back.  He's coming back.  We'll call him out on it.  Yeah.  Return of Vanilla Ice.  All right.  Marvel at the originality, humor, and chemistry displayed while telling this Justin Bieber story.  Oh, Star 94, Atlanta's, today's hits without the rap with Cindy and Jimmy.  It's an old carnival sign or something. 
[02:16:00]  Marvel!  Marvel at this.  So they got some good chemistry.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's just the way they can inject the jokes.  You know how you were saying earlier today?  You just stick with whatever we're doing because we'll get the jokes in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do the exact same thing.  All right.  So Justin Bieber, he's in China right now, and you're thinking, this doesn't have to do with Vanilla Ice.  Wait for it.  Justin Bieber's in China right now, and he seems to be having such a good time, such a good time,  that he thinks that his bodyguards should just pretty much do everything for him. 
[02:16:30]  For example, they were at the Great Wall of China where they're visiting,  and they carried him up the Great Wall of China on their shoulders.  Oh, stop it.  They did not carry him on.  There are also pictures of Justin Bieber skateboarding with his bodyguards running to keep up with him.  On the Great Wall?  Isn't there a sign there that says, please, no bicycles or skateboards?  No skateboarding.  On the Great Wall of China.  That's good.  That's good, right?  That was spontaneous. 
[02:17:00]  Fuck yeah.  Wow.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Oh, my God.  It was like a love jacked over.  There's a photo on their Facebook page.  I don't know why, but one of their listeners, his name's Hemorrhoids McGillicuddy.  Really?  And his picture looks a lot like Opie with a baby diaper mustache.  Posted a nude photo of Bobo with his penis showing. 
[02:17:30]  That's not nice.  And the caption says, shut up, cunts.  It's Bobo time.  It's Bobo time.  One of his many catchphrases.  Bobo comes up with them.  Oh, he does.  Hey, we're getting some intel.  We got some intel coming in here.  Oh, okay.  Jason in D.C.  Jason.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  You already got this guy.  Jimmy Alexander was his name when he was here in D.C.  What?  It made my morning, I think, last year when you guys made my name.  We nailed this guy already? 
[02:18:00]  Wait, we got him when he was in D.C.  and now we're getting him in Atlanta?  Yeah, he was Radio Sidekick before with his, like, the quasi-Fez voice.  Okay.  And now I guess he's moved down to Atlanta to Green Pastures  because Jack Diamond is now unemployed here in the D.C. market.  Wait, he was on Jack Diamond's show?  Yeah, the Jack Diamond morning show.  Ew.  Wow, we already went after this guy.  That's not nice.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, but now he's a host.  We had no idea.  Yeah, well. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  He's as terrible as a host.  He's going to think we're following.  Yeah, thank you, Jason.  Maybe we are.  Well, Bieber had his bodyguards, what, carry him up the Great Wall of China?  So that's, like, a publicity fucking skunk thing, right?  Stop.  There's a photo of our producer.  Dr. Gay.  Travis, a.k.a. Dr. Gay.  Oof.  And he's wearing a red Christmas sweater.  It is the worst sweater.  It's red.  It's got, like, a plaid, black.  Where did they find that?  A white plaid thing going on and a bow. 
[02:19:00]  That was from my bad Christmas sweater Christmas card.  And he's holding his dog, who's got a Jingle Bell collar on.  That non-breathing shitbox.  Oh, God.  The caption just says, Dr. Gay says hi.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Very nice.  This is an embarrassing photo.  Yeah.  Not really.  Here's a photo of Anthony Cumia hanging out with several black gang members.  Why does, I think that's photoshopped.  I don't think so. 
[02:19:30]  Dennis Falco.  There's a picture of Denny.  Yelling.  And he's making a big, yeah, yelling, expressive face.  And it says.  Behind the board, by the way.  Where, what station?  That looks like Walk 97.  Oh, that's the Long Island station.  Okay.  Walk FM.  And it says, this is Dennis Falcone.  He told us to attack your Facebook page.  This is our fight club.  He is our Tyler Turden.  They're embracing Dennis Falcone as their leader. 
[02:20:00]  That's great.  For Jocktober.  Oh, that rules.  Oh, I'm kidding.  What's the Bieber story, though?  Well, he was on, and they went to the Great Wall of China.  And why were the bodyguards carrying him?  He just had him do it, because he's a little douche.  Because he's a douchebag.  Yeah.  He probably hurt his leg, the little leg.  He probably didn't.  He probably...  Twist my ankle.  Maybe he was high on the dope.  Oh, that poor kid.  Come on, guys.  Yeah, I feel bad for him.  God bless him.  Just stop.  Guys!  There's a photo from Game of Thrones. 
[02:20:30]  Sure.  Instead of the lead guy with the beard and everything, Scott Shannon's head is...  Well, he's getting ready, because he knows we're coming for him.  And it says Jocktober is coming, so he's preparing.  Oh, God.  Wow.  What's that?  A photo of a small Anthony Cumia inside what appears to be an asshole.  You have to turn that.  I can't see it, Shannon.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Jeez.  Why didn't you notice the pussy in that picture?  Anthony's not in the pussy.  He's in the asshole.  I don't know what that is.  Is that even a pussy?  What is that?  That's a pussy.  I don't know. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  Oh.  Travis...  Travis Teft is also getting credited for unleashing everybody on this Facebook page.  The hounds.  His head is put on the gladiators button.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  So now we move on with Cindy and Jimmy on Star 94 in Atlanta.  Guess what?  They talk about GTA 5.  All right.  Well, this is a good guy break.  We talked about GTA 5.  Sure.  And now they're talking about GTA 5.  Right. 
[02:21:30]  But all I want to do is steal cars and get chased by Smokey.  That's what I want in my life.  And that's what I saw the commercials for the new Grand Theft Auto 5.  Oh, you are a video game guy?  Well, that's the thing.  Oh, my God.  There it was.  There it was.  That right there, people, is...  Is the hole.  The hole.  The hole.  That was the hole voice.  It was the hole content.  Perfect.  Perfect.  She played it perfectly.  Wow. 
[02:22:00]  The first hole comment of this year's Jacktober.  There you go.  You're a video game guy.  Oh, you're a video game guy?  Safe to assume most guys are video game guys.  Yeah.  At least to some extent.  A major majority.  What is that picture?  It's a really...  On their Facebook page.  I don't know how it got there.  Star 94 in Atlanta.  It's a very unflattering photo of our former intern, Cream Pie Jones.  That's Cream Pie.  Yeah.  Cream Pie Jones had the worst body on him. 
[02:22:30]  Well, the photo is taken from behind, and it's just his body, and all he's wearing is  a pair of hot rod briefs.  Well, we made him wear the hot rod briefs.  Well, it was the hottest rod contest.  Yeah, to promote the hottest rod contest we did for the movie.  He's got a lot of muffin top coming over.  Very large love handles coming over the top.  I think he was a mess.  Yeah, I think he still is.  Let's get him...  Call him.  Oh.  What are you doing?  Doing the same bit.  Fuck.  Sorry.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to give him a call and see if he'll... 
[02:23:00]  Tell him we want to talk about Syracuse.  That didn't work.  We'll take our calls these days.  Once I got him on the after show, and I started asking him about his internship, and he said,  the phone screener informed me you wanted to talk about Syracuse.  Syracuse.  And he hung up.  Because he won't talk about his experience as an intern.  He's very ashamed of what he did.  Why not?  His videos with shit on his head.  Oh, boy!  Yeah, I don't know if you remember.  One time you took a shit in a toilet, Jim, and he picked up the shit with his bare hands. 
[02:23:30]  Let's go to the bathroom.  And said, big boy made a doody.  Big boy made a doody.  Then he put it back into the toilet.  And you're wondering why.  And he flushed it and said, bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  To the doody.  He waved at it, too?  Yeah, he did say goodbye.  He waved at feces.  It was like chop meat, too, that fucking dump.  Yeah, that was a fucking, that was a soupy disaster of a shite.  He picked it up like chili con carne. 
[02:24:00]  Baby type of mustache.  I love the Facebook attack that's going on.  Wow, a lot of great pictures showing up.  And we have nothing to do with this.  We didn't say a word.  I don't like it.  Here's GTA 5.  They talked about it on Star 94 with Cindy and Jimmy featuring them today on Jocktober.  Are you a video game guy?  Well, no, that's the thing, Cindy.  I'm not a video game guy.  I play a video maybe once a year.  I'll get one, and I'll start playing.  I become obsessed with it, then I'm done with it.  But I'm not what you call a gamer.  Okay.  So I go in, and I'm with Cindy. 
[02:24:30]  We go in a store.  I buy it.  It's like $70.  It was expensive.  I was kind of surprised.  I shook a little for you when you bought it.  Cindy, that's how bad I wanted to steal cars.  And get chased by Smokey.  Because you can steal a sports car, a van, an SUV, trucks, tractors, scooters, motorcycles,  RVs, boats, 18-wheelers, for crying out loud.  And since that's illegal to do that in real life, you just wanted to play it.  That's right.  And you know what you can also do?  She had to remind.  Pedestrians.  But you're not supposed to do that.  It'd be funny if you said I wanted to hit my co-host in the head with a fucking hammer. 
[02:25:00]  What just happened there?  Oh, it's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Rewind on that one, because the first part was she had to remind everybody that stealing vehicles  is illegal in real life.  I didn't hear that.  You know why?  Why?  I tapped out.  Why?  I don't know.  I was in, because he sounded like all man talking about that GTA.  Dude, I faded out.  What happened?  Well, he's talking about GTA.  You can't handle this.  No, I just, I'm not even joking.  I just faded out.  What happened?  He was talking about being chased by Smokey.  And she has a problem with that?  And you could take a car, a motorcycle, scooters, even 18-wheelers. 
[02:25:30]  He named everything.  Yeah.  Once he names all the vehicles.  How far back do I go?  I'm going to listen this time.  Maybe 12 seconds.  Okay.  Listen to her.  There's RVs, boats, 18-wheelers.  Okay, so the first part is you listen to her mention that that's illegal, because it's  like reminding the listeners.  Then right after that, tell me if this is a whole moment or not.  Oh, okay.  Hey, it's Paul Williams.  Is he here already?  Yes, he is. 
[02:26:00]  Hold him back.  Maybe he's gone to another.  Hold him back for a little bit.  Is he going to another studio?  Hopefully.  Because you can steal a sports car, a van, an SUV, trucks, tractors, scooters, motorcycles,  RVs, boats, 18-wheelers, for crying out loud.  And since that's illegal to do that in real life, you just wanted to play it.  That's right.  And you know what you can also do?  Hit pedestrians.  But you're not supposed to.  Oh, my gosh.  I mean, that's what happens.  Oh, you get points for it.  No, no, you really do.  You get cash sometimes.  This is a terrible game.  Oh, it's horrible.  Oh, God.  The more you hit, the more police chase you. 
[02:26:30]  No, no, okay.  All right.  I don't want to hear any more about it.  Oh, my God.  Women stink on the radio.  God, they suck on the radio.  They just stink on the air.  I don't want to hear any more about it.  Why would you?  It's fun.  Yeah, why would you?  It's right.  Wow, what a hole.  Holy fuck.  She is quite the hole.  You think she's a hole?  Definitive.  You end up feeling bad for the dude.  You can't hear his energy.  He's trying to at least get something going. 
[02:27:00]  Is he?  Oh, I don't want to hear any more.  What?  Look at Jimmy's face.  It makes me physically ill.  Doesn't it?  Do I have to deal with that?  Why?  Why would you ever deal with that?  Oh, my teeth.  What are they?  It's a big fake teeth in my picture.  Fuck, you had nine teeth pulled.  I did?  Are they really?  Oh, my God.  Those morons.  You guys fucking suck.  Wow, what happened?  We just told the truth here. 
[02:27:30]  I had to explain.  On our show.  This dumb show is on.  I'm out of work.  There's a picture of Scorch.  That's a great photo.  That is a good pic of Scorch right there.  These guys are very creative this year so far.  Sibby.  Sibby is really good.  I got Sibby with me.  Yeah.  That's your Scorch impression.  Yeah, Sibby.  That's a good one.  Know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  There's a picture of what's his name from the CW that Arthur Chan and on the top of it  it says, what the fuck is your problem, man?  That's what he said. 
[02:28:00]  Old school.  It was old school.  You got to go old school, too.  You got to pee.  I drank two coffees.  I'll be right back.  But you're in the hot tub.  We're naked broad in this one.  And two men.  And two men.  And one of the men has his balls on Jimmy's head.  That's really uncomfortable.  Balls are resting on Jimmy's head.  Jim, why'd you do that?  I just wanted to get in the water.  I wanted to frolic.  All right.  I'm going to pee.  All right.  Fine.  It's time for their marquee bit.  What is it?  It's called the Purse Playlist Montage. 
[02:28:30]  That's right.  The Purse Playlist Montage.  Okay.  Do you want me to tell you the rules of this?  Please.  It's a contest.  It is a contest.  Okay.  You have to find a fugitive?  No.  So, by the way, as an update, it appears phase one is complete.  Oh.  Boo.  What's phase one again?  Phase one is they turn their wall off to commenters, and then people start commenting on all their posts.  On other comments.  Right.  On other posts. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  All right.  So you can still get in there.  You can do all the things.  Until phase two.  There's a photo of Dennis Falcone.  He's in front of a mic and a board at a radio station.  And in big letters, it says, if Dennis Falcone can do it, why the fuck can't you?  We got funny listeners, man.  Oh, that's great.  Dennis is the hero of Jacktober.  Yeah.  We got some funny fucking listeners.  All right.  So it's the marquee bit.  What?  It's a contest.  It's a contest.  Okay.  A caller calls up.  Oh, I like contests. 
[02:29:30]  And they automatically, they win a purse.  A purse.  Yes.  And.  Is there something in the purse?  Well, Opie, now that you mention it, if they can name all the songs in the music montage,  they get $1,000 in the purse they just won.  And that's the purse.  Purse.  Purse.  Playlist montage.  Purse.  Purse.  Purse. 
[02:30:00]  Good morning, Jan.  How are things in Kennesaw?  Oh, nice and quiet this morning.  Nothing better than when two broads start yapping.  Oh, yeah.  Makes for compelling radio.  What's your heart?  Good morning, Jan.  How are things in Kennesaw?  Oh, nice and quiet this morning.  I bet they're going to be a little better and a little bit louder with your poppy red striped  Tory birch tote.  Oh, my God.  I'm so excited.  Oh.  Jan, you should because this bag is pretty. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, I cannot wait.  Thank you, guys.  You're welcome.  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  I can't take it.  Oh, wow.  Go do that in the bathroom when you're putting new tampons in.  That's terrible.  Oh, God.  Oh, I'm so excited.  Oh, God.  Oh, did you see what one of their listeners put?  Their listener, Lyle Tripperson.  Yeah.  Did you see what he put on their Facebook page?  Oh.  Jim Chandler.  Yeah.  Did you see what the caption is? 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  No, I don't see.  May I read it?  Yeah, you can read it.  It's terrible.  It says, Greg Opie Hughes hates me.  I totally hate it.  Sad face.  And a picture of Jim Chandler.  We're almost friends again.  Let's call the fuck down.  That's Opie's college friend that he jock-tobered last year because he hates him.  Is Paul Williams doing another show right now?  Yeah.  Okay, go.  Let's get through jock-tober.  So they're doing a purse bit.  And we just got through two girls just yapping with each other.  You're welcome. 
[02:31:30]  Jan, now the purse is great, but here's your moment where you could put $1,000 in that new  purse.  Check out the Star 94 Purse Playlist Montage.  Okay, Jan.  I got it.  Can you tell us the names of the songs and artists in the montage?  $1,000 is yours.  Well, I thought my kids talk fast, but that's too fast for me.  I just had a little fun, you know.  I just had a little fun for everybody.  I thought my kids talk fast. 
[02:32:00]  She's delightful.  She's a true delight.  Yeah.  My kids talk fast, but that's too fast for me.  I don't know.  Jan, that's okay.  You didn't get the $1,000, but you got yourself a new Tory Birch bag this morning.  But you did get this.  It's a roach clip that you put on your clit.  It's an alligator clip.  Your clit hood.  You did win this.  You have to put it on until your clit falls off like a skin tag. 
[02:32:30]  Yuck.  She won a purse.  You're supposed to make that shit easy.  No.  Fuck.  Was that it, hopefully?  Yeah, for that one.  Okay, good.  You know what would be great if her purse had big pieces of horse shit in it?  You don't tell her that she won a fucking purse full of horse shit.  Well, very good news.  You know, we like when the jocks talk about themselves a little bit.  You get to learn a little bit about them. 
[02:33:00]  That's the way you develop a relationship with your favorite radio personalities.  Yes.  I love that when you start the clip by saying, very good news.  Very good news here.  Because it is.  It is.  It is very good news.  It's great news that we're going to learn about this.  Some of these clips have not worked out as well as we thought.  No, this is going to be a good one.  Very good news.  I enjoy when a jock shares a little bit about themselves.  What is Intern David doing in that picture?  On their Facebook page.  I saw, I don't know.  They must have some weird connection because one of their listeners posted a photo of Intern David. 
[02:33:30]  And this was after the show one day when his immunity challenge was to eat an entire cake.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Which was off the air and had nothing to do with our radio show, by the way.  Didn't even get brought up on the air.  Did he's cute?  No, no.  No, he just ate until he was full.  Why don't we get him on the show, maybe?  See if you can call Intern David?  Why don't we call him?  Oh, no.  Oh, that's right.  He literally, literally runs away from people that say that, hey, you're David from the  Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:34:00]  Has there been one person that has left this show that doesn't hate us?  I don't know.  He's not working.  Can you name one fucking person?  Sidney and Jackie.  True.  Oh, that's right.  I wonder why that is.  Sidney and Jackie.  Pat Duffy doesn't hate us?  Pat Duffy's another one.  Okay, good.  David works at the 9-11 one.  Not right now.  The government's closed.  Oh.  Wouldn't that be closed to tourists?  Is that federal or state?  Yes, it is.  Oh, well, it's federal.  Because the Statue of Liberty is federal.  Right.  And that's closed.  So the 9-11 memorial?  No, no, no.  Now I can't go to work. 
[02:34:30]  I can't go to work.  Well, Bobo, what do you do, Bobo?  What would you do, Bobo?  Bobo, what would you do, Bobo?  All right, Star 94.  We've got to rush this along because we've got Paul Williams.  Obviously, he's going to finish.  It's morning for Cindy and Jimmy.  Cindy, we learned a little bit about Cindy here.  Thank God.  This is nice.  Last night for dinner, we had what I thought was a normal, healthy meal.  Dog shit.  I explained it to Mr. Jimmy Alexander, and he proceeded to make the sound. 
[02:35:00]  I know what her meal was.  What was her meal?  It was placenta and a kumquat.  That was the worst meal ever.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  We had herbal tea and the diarrhea of a cancer patient.  Holy shit.  I have an update.  Yes, Sam Roberts.  What's up?  The Star 94 Facebook page has been taken.  Why did they do that? 
[02:35:30]  Oh, no.  Facebook page.  They don't know how to have fun.  It's gone?  Let me see the Facebook.  Let me show you.  See, you click the Facebook link here.  Yeah, where does it go?  From their website?  Yeah, it just goes to the main Facebook page.  Oh, man.  What's the main Facebook page?  Meaning facebook.com.  Oh.  Like, it just goes because there is no.  Where's that page?  Well, at the moment, it's non-existent.  Oh, what happened?  Fuck.  Yeah, so.  People just don't know how to have fun anymore.  I would love to hear the conversations, you know, at these stations, like down there. 
[02:36:00]  Like someone going, what happened to the webpage?  Like, what happened to our Facebook page?  Fucking.  Well, I gotta.  Take it down.  Take it down.  There's fucking horrible stuff.  I don't know if they were lying or not, but on Monday, somebody called the after show  and said their brother works for a radio station in D.C.  Yeah.  And that they were having meetings on the 30th of September or whatever.  Oh, about.  Saying, you know, I'll be an Anthony to do their Jocktober thing.  Here's how to handle it.  Be on the lookout.  Look at the Facebook page.  If you see pictures of Anthony Cumia or Big Black Dicks pop up, it's probably their fans. 
[02:36:30]  It really has become a thing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Other radio shows are aware of it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Especially since this is like the, I don't know, probably the seventh year of doing this.  Oh, my God.  It's a month.  We've been at it a while.  So Cindy here is going to tell us about what she ate.  She thought it was healthy.  But, you know, Jimmy didn't think that it was.  He didn't like it.  Yeah, yeah.  Salon.  Mm-hmm.  I told him we had salmon.  Mm-hmm.  Some Parmesan noodles. 
[02:37:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then a mix of squash, zucchini, and mushrooms.  Mm-hmm.  Which I felt out of my husband's asshole.  She's even a dullard when she eats.  Ugh.  She's sitting there.  That sounds horrible.  She's probably sitting there cutting it.  This is wonderful.  Shoving it in her dumb face.  Yeah.  Or no, she's got the fucking zucchini hanging out of her box.  Honey, where's the eggplant?  And then she does, like, the do-si-do, and it fucking plops on the floor. 
[02:37:30]  Right out of her ass.  Yeah.  She's got a fucking...  She's got a cuke in her asshole and a zook in her box.  Like, tell me, Jesus.  And a zook.  A zook.  And when he came home, she was fucking up.  Well, you know.  Oh.  Holy fuck.  All right, let's see what the problem is with this.  I don't know. 
[02:38:00]  I like salmon.  Yeah.  The trifecta of...  Easy.  And while I am not a vegetable fan, and those would not be my favorite vegetables, I didn't  have that same way.  That's a great thing to say if you're a nurse, and you've just pulled the plug on somebody.  I'm a vegetable fan.  Yeah, so I'm tired of washing this thing, moving his little gourd-like genitals.  It's gone.  I'm a fan, and those would not be my favorite vegetables. 
[02:38:30]  I didn't have that same reaction.  So you got squash, zucchini, and what was the third?  Mushrooms.  Mushrooms.  Oh, my gosh.  I just put in the mushrooms over.  I don't really do the mushrooms either.  No.  Well, thank God you have a dog, Cindy.  What you do is you rake all those vegetables on the floor and let the...  Slather it on.  Yeah.  Put other mitts on them.  They don't give him table food.  Oh.  Oh, God.  I don't give them table food.  No, she gives them lap food.  Give them boxed lunch.  The dog's always under the table.  Her husband's like, what's going on in there?  She's got her fucking feet up and under the table stirrups that she hadn't sold. 
[02:39:00]  She's rolled pieces of roast beef up her pussy.  The dog can fucking...  Her pussy looks like it's smoking a cigar like a Dick Tracy.  She's got a roast beef tube hanging out.  The guy tried to make something of it.  She's like, no, I don't feed him table food.  I don't feed him table food, no.  John in Texas, we might have some intel here.  John.  Hey.  I got a personal message from producer Casey at their show.  Okay. 
[02:39:30]  Why is he writing you?  I put a post on there that said, Anthony is the true Grand Dragon.  Send him to Metro Mall.  A Metro Mall.  That's where our security buddy was.  They sent me a personal message saying that O&A suck and they have to resort to bullying other stations.  Bullying?  Oh, wow.  Ew.  We're fucking hurt.  Bullying.  Shit.  I don't like the bullying.  They're onto us.  We're not bullying.  We do suck and we are bullies.  We're making fun of you.  It's different.  We're critiquing your work.  That fucking hurts. 
[02:40:00]  We're critics.  Punch it out, boys.  Tell them that was a low blow.  Yeah, we don't go for that.  Wow.  Is that Cindy right there?  Oh, yeah.  We got a better picture of her?  Let's see what she looks like.  She's not bad looking.  She's actually pretty.  She's a pretty slim girl.  Give her a smooch.  Yeah, she's a...  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  Is that...  Wait.  Is that a mug shot?  Or...  Oh, no. 
[02:40:30]  Okay.  Yeah, it is.  She's a better egg than I thought.  I like this girl.  We always...  I love when we find the little nuggets.  A little nugget.  Oh, no.  There it is.  What happened?  Give us the story, Sam.  This is from 2006.  Okay.  Fair enough.  All right.  As you know, we've all done some things.  Everyone makes their mistakes.  We've all done some things.  A lot's changed.  A lot's changed since 2006.  She's a different person now.  Okay.  Because on October 7th, 2006, Star 94's Cindy was arrested for alleged DUI. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, no.  What happened?  What are the circumstances?  Was she weaving?  Was she trying to fucking tasty up that vegetable medley with a tequila arm?  Or Cindy?  Or was it aggravated DUI and they had to dig a patent leather shoe out of her grill?  Jesus!  Ow!  Yeah, she was driving the fucking the wrong way up the sawmill.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Wow. 
[02:41:30]  What do we got?  Um, this story all, uh, okay.  Uh, so Cindy says that she had been in a bridal shower, had a couple drinks earlier in the evening.  That's it.  That's it.  So close to midnight, she drove three of her girlfriends, uh, she drove three of her girlfriends  to their cars.  Oh.  A cop pulled her over for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign.  Oh.  She just kicked the girls out of the van?  Get the fuck out, you cunts.  She opened the side door and then took a hair pinch her and they all just tumbled out. 
[02:42:00]  He asked her to, uh, follow the finger.  Oh.  Yeah.  Walk in a straight line.  Oh, boy.  And, uh, she felt she did fine on those, but when he asked her to take a breathalyzer,  she refused.  Ah.  Smart.  Uh, he proceeded to arrest her on suspicion of DUI.  Ah.  Uh, and he handcuffed her and, uh, blah, blah, blah.  Uh, she felt she was not intoxicated.  You think she's smart to refuse or no? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Why?  Well, you got more breathing room.  You got a little more bargaining room in, uh, court.  If you blow and you know you're drunk, you're fucking drunk and that's it.  Right.  If you know you're fucking drunk, you don't blow.  Oh, if you're not, if you know you're not, you haven't been drinking, you blow like a  motherfucking dyno.  You're nothing to lose.  Yeah.  But if you, uh, if you've been drinking, you don't blow.  Right.  Yeah.  That's the story.  I don't know what the update was.  Oh.  All right.  Ah.  You're going to get your license suspended for like 90 days.  Right.  Um, if it's your first. 
[02:43:00]  Well.  All she wants to do, like you Google.  Is dance.  You Google image her.  Oh.  And it's like the third picture that comes up as a mug shot.  Whoops.  She's happy about that?  No.  Let's see some like, uh, nice pictures of her.  Let's, let's see her.  She's aight.  She's pretty, yeah.  She's aight.  Blow that up.  Give her a smooch.  A smooch-a-roo.  Hey, hey, babe.  Let's take a little look, see here.  What's up?  All right.  Yeah.  You know what?  She's aight.  She ain't too bad right there.  Not too bad at all.  And she's a fucking drunk. 
[02:43:30]  It's great.  She could drink.  Now I know why she doesn't like GTA.  Oh, right?  No one drives properly in GTA.  No.  That's illegal.  Now I get it.  Oh, well.  Wait a minute.  Do her picture?  Who's that with her?  Throw mama from the train.  That might be her mom, though.  Is that her mom?  It looks like her mom.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, we got two more clips to do before Paul waves.  Oh, please.  Who's the lady that said Ben Franklin hairdo?  We got to push this along.  All right.  Here we go.  Back to-  So I guess this leads to a phone topic bit called gross foods. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Sounds fun.  This sounds good.  And this one is terrific.  And it ends with a big laugh, which you want in radio.  Yes.  When you're doing radio, you want to go out on a big fucking laugh and hit that sweeper.  Yes.  Star 94.  Star 94 mornings with Cindy and Jimmy at 640.  So we're talking about foods that are so gross to you, but maybe no one else.  Good morning, Amanda and Decula.  What about you?  Chicken on a bone.  Completely grosses me out. 
[02:44:30]  I've heard that before.  It just creeps you.  Well, how do you eat it?  Like chicken or anything?  It has to be boneless.  I went to KFC last night for the kids, and after picking it off the bone for them, it grossed me out.  I didn't even eat dinner.  Amanda, I'm sorry.  You give me a bucket of chicken from KFC, I'm a happy man.  Yeah.  My face is in the bucket, practically.  Oh, boy.  That's why they call Cindy Bucket.  Bucket of beers.  My face is in the bucket.  You'll know my face is in the bucket, which I'm half in the bag. 
[02:45:00]  Vomiting up fucking rum.  The bucket next to the bed.  You got it.  Old bed spins McGillicuddy.  I got one foot on the floor, and I'm looking at the ceiling, y'all, and I'll never do it again.  And my fucking face is in the bucket.  I love that we found that.  That just adds a whole other dimension to the abuse.  Oh, what's going on, Sam Roberts?  No, nothing.  The face book's still down.  Okay.  He said, I want you to blow in this. 
[02:45:30]  I said, fuck you, pig.  Yeah.  My face is in the bucket, practically.  No.  That's why they called Cindy Buckethead when she was a kid.  Wow.  So, Amanda, you don't even do hot wings, then?  No.  You're missing so much, Amanda.  Our heart goes out to you.  They called it a bucket head because she put a bucket on her head, cut a hole in it, and she would blow you.  Give me some bucket head. 
[02:46:00]  No, it was a buck for head.  Oh, they mispronounced it.  Buck for head.  Hey, if we're going to be accused of being bullies.  Right.  Wow.  You hear the big laugh, though?  They got a big laugh there at the end.  That's nice.  Hey, look at that.  Someone on PalTalk saying, hey, Cindy's Facebook is still up.  Oh, why would they?  I don't know.  She's nice.  I mean, she's very pretty.  They're not going to make her.  What's up for the big laugh?  She's a kid.  Wow.  So, Amanda, you don't even do hot wings, then? 
[02:46:30]  No.  You're missing so much, Amanda.  Our heart goes out to you.  Oh, God.  All right.  The final clip for today's Jocktober.  All right?  All right.  Final clip.  And then we got some Paul Williams action.  Cindy and Jimmy show.  It's very pretty.  They do one more call on the gross food bit that's going very well for them.  All right.  Carla in Athens.  So, what is a food that completely grosses you out, but most other people eat it? 
[02:47:00]  Oh, I have boiled okra.  See?  See?  Eh, eh.  There's only one way that should be prepared.  Fried.  Then you don't taste it.  Yeah.  Then you don't taste it.  It's like the grease is okay.  But to see someone, oh, God.  It is like, I'm sorry.  It's like watching them eat mucus, okay?  It is.  It is.  Ew. 
[02:47:30]  I don't know.  I thought he was kind of nice.  Ew.  There you have it.  There you have it for today.  Star 94 in Atlanta.  Oh, my God.  That was bad.  Yeah.  A gross food phone topic.  Not good.  Yeah, that was just...  Wow.  All right.  It was lackluster.  Damn.  A lackluster show.  You think so?  Yeah, that's what I would call it. 
[02:48:00]  Morning drollery.  Morning dreck.  Morning milk toast.  It's milk toast in the morning.  That's a chick show.  So, just get two chicks.  Why do you force...  Dishing.  But why do you force the guy to do it?  Exactly.  That's a chick show.  Well, you got to get the men involved, too.  How are they getting involved with that?  He wants to get chased by the Smokies.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Smokies.  What the hell is he talking about?  I don't know.  No one plays GTA and thinks, oh, look, the Smokies are on me. 
[02:48:30]  No, not even if there's guys with cigarettes running after you.  Never thinking.  We should go to break right now, so...  We have plenty of time with Mr. Paul Williams, who...  I'm tired.  I guess is around the corner there.  Another studio.  Yeah.  He's scheduled for 9.30.  He's having his rump kissed.  Okay.  That's nice.  Roland just emailed me.  He wants to know if we'll take Jessica Seinfeld. 
[02:49:00]  Jerry won't come...  Jerry's wife?  Jerry won't come on the show, but his wife will.  What's Jerry's wife promoting?  She's got a new cooking book.  Oh, he had her to Charlie.  A cookbook?  Yeah, a cookbook.  She's very nice, but I would prefer to get Jerry first.  That's a cookbook.  What the hell?  We pretty much have begged to have Jerry on the show.  Yeah.  Does she cook, like, Fazeeli Jerry?  Stuff like that?  She fucking put him in the little pan, cook him up, a little sauce.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Well, does she tell you how to make a nice fruit salad with the Mackinac peaches, Jerry? 
[02:49:30]  The Mackinac peaches!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Oh, yeah.  Coming down the green bar.  Coming, yeah.  Open the door for Paul Williams.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Fashion love song.  Welcome back.  Paul Williams.  What a pleasure.  We bow to you, sir.  I love Paul Williams.  He does.  Take a seat, sir.  Well, we can sit him over here first.  Where?  What do you want?  Right there.  Right there, Mr. Williams.  Sure.  We got to call you Mr. Williams.  Mr. Williams, please.  Mr. Williams?  It's the Pauly Show.  The O.P. and Anthony.  Yes.  The O.P. and Pauly Show.  The Pauly.  Paul Williams.  The Pauly Baba.  Man.  We can't believe that you don't play piano. 
[02:50:30]  We're amazed by that.  Yeah, but you got to understand something.  Yeah.  Because you can...  Where am I going?  We got a mic in there.  Yeah, there's a mic right there.  Pull that mic up.  Hold on.  What button there?  The last one, this one.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Yeah, pull that mic up because you could still talk.  Okay, wait a minute.  Do you buzz you?  That's amazing.  Actually, when you keep the sound off, then it's like, you know, loneliness takes the romance.  You could be great if you don't hear it.  How do you know what chord sounds like what if you can't play it? 
[02:51:00]  Well, because, you know, you know what it sounds like when you fart and you haven't quite found it, you know?  Sounds like everybody else in the room going, ugh.  What mic is that, Mars?  We're trying to set up Paul Williams' nice here.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  Anthony brought up a very good...  I did.  ...point or question.  Oh, yes.  I obviously watched you years ago and all throughout your career, and I know, or I could remember seeing you at the piano 
[02:51:30]  on some of those shows singing a song.  Yeah.  Did they maybe tape you from the other side?  No, no, no.  It was like, you know, I think I actually played a couple, you know, I'd play, I think I could play a perfect love.  I could, but there were, but there were like shows that we do in England where you pre-record everything.  Uh-huh.  So you're lip syncing anyway, you know?  Oh, okay.  So it's like, when you do that, it's like, you can be the best.  Yeah.  He throws his hands up in the air. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, do that thing where you get under the piano and play backwards, upside down.  Sure.  Yeah, pick it up and carry it.  Yeah.  But I can't hear anything here.  Yeah, what's the matter with that keyboard there, Mars?  It doesn't sound very loud.  Where's the volume?  Oh, man.  We hear it here.  You do.  But barely.  Your airflow volumes up?  Barely.  Yeah, barely.  People look right through me when I was all alone. 
[02:52:30]  Never seemed to notice I was there at all.  So there's a little volume.  They always seem to look the other way.  And winter days were colder.  You're playing a piano.  When I was all alone.  You know, but it's pretty bad.  I mean, it's like...  Wait a minute.  You're going to make a living doing this?  Really?  Really?  Just an old-fashioned love song. 
[02:53:00]  Playing on the radio.  And wrapped around the music.  It gets pretty boring.  No, no, no.  What are you kidding?  Not for us.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  Just an old-fashioned.  On stage.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Coming down in three-part harmony. 
[02:53:30]  It's really terrible when I do it.  That's why I spend all that money for musicians.  You know, we...  When you wrote that song,  because it does have kind of a more...  I don't know the word for it,  but it's a little more campy when you did it.  A little more...  Like, almost ragtime-ish.  I did it very ragtime-y.  Yeah, very ragtime-y.  When you...  Like, when Three Dog Night took it,  do you have any say over how it is  or what it sounds like  and then it gets released?  Or you can say,  I don't want my song.  I'm not even allowed in the building. 
[02:54:00]  Chuck Negron said,  first of all,  I don't want to record it.  Oh, God.  I had three hits with Three Dog Night.  Are we on the air yet?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Not interesting.  It changes nothing.  It changes absolutely nothing.  But there's a guy named Richie Podler  who was their producer.  I had three hits with him.  I had old-fashioned love song  Family Man out in the country  in the opposite order.  Out in the country,  old-fashioned love song  and then Family Man.  Hold on.  Give me 20 minutes 
[02:54:30]  while I remember which order they're in.  But the fact is that  they didn't want to record any of those.  I wrote old-fashioned love song  for the Carpenters.  I knew that Richard would love it.  It was old-fashioned.  It was kind of rinky-dinky.  Richard Carpenter was going to love this.  He didn't listen to it  through the first verse.  It was like, next.  Wow.  Wow.  No kidding.  But Three Dog Night recorded  all three of my songs reluctantly  and they were all three hits.  They didn't want to do it.  They didn't want to do it.  They didn't like me.  They didn't like my songs.  What the fuck?  It's the problem.  I know. 
[02:55:00]  No, but you know,  actually Chuck Negron and I  are really good friends.  No, it wasn't a matter  if they didn't like me.  It's just they wanted to do  a little edgier stuff.  But Family Man is very edgy.  Play it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you don't have it queued up?  Oh, okay.  I'll have to be leaving.  No?  No.  We can play a little bit of that.  We could definitely.  Yeah, they made your song dark.  They made it dark.  They made it dark.  This tired city  was somebody's dream.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I'm talking about  a love song, too.  Old-fashioned love song  that made it dark, too.  Old-fashioned love song.  Just a good old song.  Yeah.  I love what they did with it. 
[02:55:30]  Well, you did.  You liked it like right away?  You know, listen.  If I was the only one  who sang my songs,  I'd be hot walking horses  right now.  I mean, let's just.  I mean, I wouldn't be sitting here  with Opie and Anthony.  I would be, you know,  go, come on, paint, you know.  Let's get you wiped down  before you catch a sneezy, you know.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  How many hits did you have?  Not nearly enough.  As many as people, you know,  like, we tried to really puff it up  in all the bio through the years.  It looked like I was.  I looked like a really important writer.  But there are guys out there  with so many more hits than me, you know. 
[02:56:00]  But, you know, I had a half dozen  that kind of hung in there.  More than a half dozen, I think.  Come on.  You know, but see,  here's what I'm excited about.  I just turned.  You guys called me on my birthday.  I just turned to 73.  I've got the two songs  on the Daft Punk album.  I'm more excited about  my two album cuts on Daft Punk.  That was really cool, yeah.  We played the whole song  the other day.  It was great.  We loved it.  Well, how about Beyond?  I wrote two.  I wrote Beyond, too.  You didn't know that.  I wrote the lyrics to that  with these guys, you know.  What was the Touch one?  I loved it.  Touch is the one that I, yeah.  We liked hearing it. 
[02:56:30]  That's the one I sang.  Yeah, singing it.  Nine minutes long, you know,  so they have to pay me double.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  That's a lot.  I hope so.  I feel a lawsuit coming out.  How did that come together?  You know, they called me.  They were fans of,  I did a movie in the 70s  called Phantom of the Paradise,  which was, you know,  which even my family didn't watch.  You know what I mean?  It was like,  this was not a motion picture  that was going to change the world  based on the number of people  that went to see it,  except in two cities,  in Winnipeg, Canada,  for some reason,  Winnipeg and Paris. 
[02:57:00]  Wow.  And so the, you know,  the two gentlemen of Daft Punk  had seen Phantom of the Paradise  like 20 times,  and they were in the studio,  and Chris Caswell,  who's my music director  and my piano player,  went in to do some piano overdubs on,  I think it was on Tron.  They were doing the score for Tron.  And they started talking  about Paul Williams,  and he went,  well, I just came off the road with him.  They said,  we're trying to find him.  I went, oh,  and they went, ooh.  They called me,  and you know what?  They were fabulous to work with.  It wasn't where you went in  and they had built the house  and they were looking for wallpaper. 
[02:57:30]  They were wondering  what the house was going to look like.  So at the very beginning,  the first song we wrote was Touch.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, listening to you sing on that  was pretty cool, definitely.  Isn't that interesting?  I mean, how courageous of them.  Instead of just doing one more EDM,  one more, you know,  dance music album,  they created that whole thing.  They could have done that,  but instead they were very brave  and they got the guy that wrote,  you know, I keep playing.  The more times I do this,  the more times I get paid for it.  You'll get it right.  Just in all things. 
[02:58:00]  I'll be so...  Let me know  and then I'll just have to sing a few bars.  You'll swear you've heard of it before.  It's just a little...  But you know,  but what a treat.  They were just,  they were wonderful to work with.  And I love that they put like this,  you know,  the astronaut's comments  about seeing something out there,  Cernan's comments.  What was his name?  Yeah.  Dr. Edgar Mitchell.  Was it Mitchell,  the one who saw something out there?  Or Cernan.  Is his name Cernan?  Is it...  You know,  I'm showing my ignorance. 
[02:58:30]  I'm not sure.  At this point,  I've now lost all of the fans  of space travel.  But you know,  I'm 73 and it's going around.  I have a great memory,  but she's back on the West Coast.  Yeah.  You actually...  Are you getting any more offers  from more contemporary artists?  Not one.  No, huh?  I'm very surprised.  I bet you will.  No, actually,  you know what I'm doing right now  is we're writing Pan's Labyrinth  as a stage musical  based on, you know,  the Guillermo del Toro film.  Oh, yeah.  So doing that  with Gustavo Santo Alaya. 
[02:59:00]  And Gustavo and I  just wrote two songs  for a movie called  The Book of Life,  an animated film for Fox  that Guillermo is producing.  And, you know,  I've got my day gig.  I've got, you know,  the two things  that are really exciting  in my life  is, you know,  the day gig at ASCAP,  finding to make sure  that young,  rung writers  can make a living and all.  And my website,  which is gratitudeandtrust.com.  And, you know,  Tracy Jackson and I  are writing a book,  Gratitude and Trust Recovery  is Not Just for Addicts,  for Penguin. 
[02:59:30]  It'll be out next year.  So we're writing a book  where, you know,  we kind of created  a bunch of affirmations.  So if your life  is totally screwed,  you know,  based on bad habits,  if you're a gossip  or you keep settling down  with the wrong person,  you keep marrying  the last wife  over and over again  in a new body,  we've written  affirmations that can  kind of help you  put your life together.  We hope.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  And obviously  from experience,  you have some experience  in that.  Absolutely.  I have a black belt  and whoops,  you know.  I have a black belt 
[03:00:00]  and whoops.  I am.  It is surprising sometimes  how your memory  can be so good  with all the drug abuse  in your earlier.  You know what?  Yeah, exactly.  You know,  I misplaced,  you know,  the bumper sticker line  is that I misplaced  a decade.  You know,  you're an alcoholic  when you misplace  a decade,  you know,  like whoops,  the 80s,  gone.  Yeah, yeah.  Reagan president,  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  But yeah,  I've been sober 23 years  and it's just been,  it's been the most  amazing gift,  you know,  to wake up in the morning  and remember what I did  the night before. 
[03:00:30]  I'm still embarrassed  and ashamed once in a while,  but at least I know  what to do about it.  And now I remember  and I,  and yeah,  the fact is that,  you know,  and I speak a lot.  I speak,  you know,  I share my story a lot  at a public level  and all,  and it's a boring story.  It's your basic mayonnaise  and, you know,  kind of a drunk-a-log,  but I never came out  of a blackout  with a Russian arms dealer  or a Norman Mailer.  Norman Mailer.  No,  I can wake up on a plane  to somewhere  you don't know  where you're going.  I come out of a blackout  in the boys' department 
[03:01:00]  of Sears,  you know,  trying on,  trying on reindeer sweaters.  Some tough skins.  Yeah.  How grateful are you?  I'm very happy  that there was no Twitter  when I drank  and no fake,  like no immediate way  for me to connect  with a lot of people.  All we had was drink and dial.  Yeah.  All we had was drink and dial  and it was,  you know,  it was,  and the fact is,  even today,  I try to not send  any major,  major,  in totally complete sobriety.  I don't want to send  something out late at night  if I've decided 
[03:01:30]  I had a brilliant moment.  Let's sleep on it.  Sleep on it.  See if you want to,  yeah,  put it up there  for the world to see.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Of course,  the other thing  we're all talking about  is the fact that,  and it's so Muppety,  that they did the Muppet  nearly 35-year anniversary.  You know,  Kenny Escher and I  wrote the songs  for the Muppet movie.  They've now released it  on Blu-ray  as a nearly 35th anniversary.  They released  a contract  and asked me  to write the liner notes,  you know,  so it was,  it's interesting  that that's been  35 years. 
[03:02:00]  35 years,  yeah.  So I have you to thank.  It's my son's favorite movie.  I've seen it  10,000 times  in the last year.  This is,  I used to love  the Muppets.  This is really  testing our friendship,  isn't it?  Wow.  Sorry.  But at this point,  I can name  30 Muppets easily.  Exactly.  And you have a favorite?  I love Gonzo.  Gonzo's all right.  I'm trying to think.  Sweetums.  Sweetums,  yeah,  Sweetums.  But I also like,  you know,  I like Ratso.  Ratso?  Ratso's very cool.  What do you think  of the new movies?  Well,  the second one's coming out, 
[03:02:30]  what?  Yeah.  In the new year,  but the first one,  I really liked.  I was really impressed with them.  They were nice enough  to put Rainbow Connection  in as the big number  at the end.  There's not a movie  without that song.  Well,  thank you very much.  Thank you,  Lawrence.  What do you mean nice enough?  They had to.  It's nice to be working again.  Of course they're going  to do Rainbow Connection.  It's like the Love Boat theme.  It's like you're lying there  in bed,  you know,  in some little town in Ohio  and you turn on the TVs  on for the night before  and your mouth tastes like  the south end 
[03:03:00]  of a northbound Buffalo  and you're hearing  the Love Boat.  And you were singing  Anthony was.  Anthony did.  Come on.  I was harmonizing  with them a little bit.  I was just going  The Love Boat  Soon we'll be making  another run  The Love Boat  What I would like is  because that's what  I used to sound like.  Yes, yes, yes.  Well, that's all the cocaine.  You couldn't get your word down.  The nasal,  yeah, a little nasal  because of the coke.  It's collapsing up there.  I never knew  that was from the coke.  I don't know  if it was or not 
[03:03:30]  or if it was just  arrogance or whatever.  Love exciting and new  You climb aboard  We're expecting you  See, I'd like the old me  to have a conversation  with the new me.  With the new you.  Exactly.  I'd say, old me  What were you thinking?  You know?  Fun, fun, fun.  That seems to be what  anyone was thinking  back in the year.  Yeah, well, you know,  we did it until  the wheels fell off.  We had a lot of fun.  But, you know,  I also think that  a lot of that  was just medicating.  You know, you're sitting there 
[03:04:00]  and everything in the world  is going right.  You're this little kid  from Bennington, Nebraska,  you know,  and all of a sudden  you're sitting in a room  with Sinatra or Cary Grant  or somebody  and some part of you  goes, do I belong here at all?  And rather than look  at that thought,  you go, let's have  one more drink here.  Was it a confidence thing?  I think so.  I think that,  I think fear-based thinking  is behind a lot of booze.  A lot of drug addiction.  You were in  Smoky and the Bandit. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  My art films.  Oh, Smoky and the Bandit.  Smoky and the Bandit,  one, two, and even worse.  Even worse, yeah, yeah.  Actually, even worse  was the most fun to make.  They were a vacation  to make and a job to watch.  It was like...  And Billy Bob Thornton,  and I think I actually  used this on the air  with you guys before,  but Billy Bob Thornton  has the best line ever  about Smoky and the Bandit.  He says, you know,  in Pauline in the South,  they consider Smoky and the Bandit  a documentary.  And he's right.  I get off the airport,  off the plane, 
[03:05:00]  and walk through the airport  in Nashville,  and Lil Enos is a star.  Oh, yeah.  That first one  was one of those  great comedies of all time.  That's a great movie, man.  That's a great comedy.  Gleason was better than that.  Literally a classic.  Really funny.  Gleason, from about 10 in the morning  until about 4 in the afternoon,  Gleason was amazing.  Before 10 and after 4,  you know,  you were kind of  taking your life  in your head.  You called me hardly.  You know,  while we were shooting  the first one,  or no,  not the first one,  maybe the second  or third one,  it was...  No, it must have been...  I was given a star  on Hollywood Boulevard. 
[03:05:30]  He went,  ah, you're being given...  You're being given laurels.  You know,  you've been given laurels  hardly, you know.  Oh, shit.  So then I became hardly.  So I'd go,  oh, why don't we change this line  and just let me go hardly.  If it ain't broke,  we don't fix it.  Did you get to know them at all?  Yeah, a little bit.  And we had...  There was one amazing experience  where we were cut loose  around 4 on Pat McCormick,  who was a great big guy  that played,  you know,  my daddy,  Big Enos Burdett.  Sure.  Yep, yep.  So Pat and Jack 
[03:06:00]  and I went  and there was  a Mexican restaurant  that he wanted  Mexican food.  It was closed.  He went in.  He was the great one.  They opened it for him  and he had been drinking  all day  and he would drink  those big plastic cups  you make malts in.  He would drink that  full of,  I think,  vodka and air.  I don't know  what he mixed it with.  But he was very,  very drunk  and he got into  one of these  coughing fits.  He did that  for about  maybe 15 minutes  and then he was  just quiet, 
[03:06:30]  you know,  and you'd ask him  a question  and instead of answering  you'd go...  Oh my God.  At one point I went,  Jack,  if you're going out,  if you're dying,  can I have your watch?  He opened up one eye  and looked at me  like,  you little...  I knew he was okay.  You could tell  even during  some episodes  of The Honeymooners,  he would get into  these coughing fits  and then when he was  smoking the cigar  and he'd stop  and go,  it pays to buy the best.  I loved him.  I loved him. 
[03:07:00]  You know,  I worked with Art Carney  too.  I did a movie called  The Night They Saved Christmas  and Art Carney  played Santa Claus.  I played his chief helper.  I played more than one elf  in this lifetime.  I've got my own ears  and pointy shoes.  Yeah.  Somebody said,  ask you about Pat McCormick.  I don't know if you had any  Smokey and the Bandit stories  with Pat.  Well,  Pat used to write  the monologues for Carson.  So that's where I met him.  That's where he wrote 
[03:07:30]  all the hilarious monologues  for Carson.  Our first conscious memory  is coming out of a bar.  Him looking at me,  towering over me,  looking down at me  and he goes,  you know what little guy?  You look like an aerial  photograph of a human being.  Six foot.  What an asshole.  That's great.  I said,  wasn't I stationed on you  during the war?  It was so funny.  He said,  you know,  I can't find my car.  I don't know where  I parked my car.  You're going to have  to help me find it.  I said,  okay,  well,  I'll help you find it.  What kind of car is it? 
[03:08:00]  And he went,  oh no,  that would be cheating.  Yeah,  I just loved it.  We were great friends.  We did a bunch  of fall guys together.  I actually wrote  a movie for us  called A Rooster.  It was a movie of the week.  It was a pilot.  We did that.  We had a great time,  but then he had  a bad stroke.  Oh, wow.  Then he finally passed away,  but great guy.  Yeah.  He wrote for Carson for us.  That's amazing.  He wrote for Carson for years.  That's where Bert got the idea.  I did 48 Carsons.  I remember six. 
[03:08:30]  So I was in doing Carson  and doing The Tonight Show  and Bert Reynolds was on the show.  And Bert,  I don't remember  if it was before or after.  I'd done a movie called  The End.  I scored for Bert.  But he looked at Pat McCormick  and I was standing there talking.  He said,  I've got to get this on camera.  And the next thing you know,  he calls and he said,  come on down  and play the villains  in my movie.  Nice.  Yeah, exactly.  Smokey the Bandit  was before The End,  I'm pretty sure.  Yeah, I think it was.  I like The End.  It was a good movie, too. 
[03:09:00]  Don Deluise.  In The End  is one of the great performances.  Amazing.  One of the funniest performances ever.  You're right.  The man's nuts.  Grab him.  Yeah, yeah.  Famous line there.  Love this.  Yeah.  You got any Carson stories?  We've been learning  a lot about Carson lately.  His lawyer's coming in,  Henry Bushkin.  Oh, that'll be great.  We saw the documentary recently  and obviously everyone says  how he didn't really  have a lot of friends.  You know,  it's funny because  I was really tight  with Ed McMahon.  And it's funny  because Ed McMahon  introduced me  to his new wife 
[03:09:30]  and he said,  you know,  Paul had kind of  a problem with alcohol.  That's like getting  your fourth star  for an alcoholic.  To have Ed McMahon  the world's  most famous drunk  turn to his wife  and say,  you know,  Paul had a problem  with alcohol.  It was like  I had arrived  in alcoholic fame.  You know,  it was complete.  Oh my God.  I had a friendship  with Ed  and,  you know,  with Carson.  I'd go in  to do Carson  and I would,  you know,  I would never talk 
[03:10:00]  to him until  we were on the air.  That's what people say.  It was like he'd,  you know,  you'd kind of stay away  in that way  and I think it was  part of his successes  that he would keep it fresh,  you know,  and so what happened  when you're sitting there  talking to each other,  you know,  if you have that conversation  in the dressing room,  you know,  it's like if we had  a long talk  before the show,  this would be really  even more boring  than it is.  But the fact is  because we're out here  catching up,  you know,  after all these years,  it's a little more interesting.  But yeah,  with Carson,  it was just,  we went out a couple times  but,  you know, 
[03:10:30]  I liked him very much.  I loved how he laughed,  would laugh.  My favorite moment ever  on the Carson show  was I went on  in full orangutan makeup.  You know,  I was...  Planet of the Apes.  Planet of the Apes,  Battle for the Planet of the Apes.  Yeah.  Carson said to me,  reached up and he touched  my orangutan makeup  and he said,  this is for a movie,  isn't it?  And I said,  no,  this is seven months  of nothing but banana daiquiris.  And he fell off the...  It's my favorite bit of tape  that I have of me.  It always seemed like  a very sincere laugh  and he wasn't putting it on 
[03:11:00]  and he genuinely enjoyed  having people make him laugh.  What a great gig.  Right?  What a great gig  to just sit there  and have,  you know,  across from you  on that couch  is everybody from  Raquel Welch  to Gregory Peck  to,  you know,  whatever.  And they're there  to pretty much  entertain you.  They know  if they get a good  laugh off of Johnny,  they did well.  They did the Johnny.  So they're trying  to impress Johnny.  Yeah.  Standing back  behind that curtain  waiting to go on  with a special energy.  I mean,  it was like, 
[03:11:30]  you kind of go,  okay,  I can go on right now  because everybody's watching.  You know,  the choices for entertainment  these days  are so amazingly fractured.  But in those days  there were three networks  and everybody watched  the Tonight Show.  Oh, God, Johnny.  Everybody watched Johnny.  Hell yeah.  I was just reading  how they honored him  at Harvard one year  and just,  you know,  with other students.  Like now,  it's like late night  talk show guys  aren't as much,  you know.  But back then,  it was just like  everybody loved him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man.  I had nothing there,  by the way.  I got to ask Paul 
[03:12:00]  about the documentary.  That was when we met you.  You came in to promote  the documentary on yourself.  Yeah.  How did that work out for you?  You know,  it's interesting.  It's my warts  and all documentary.  There are parts of it  that are hard for me to watch.  You know,  I'm looking at this little guy  who's just this vapid,  arrogant,  you know,  loaded out of his brain.  There's footage of me  hosting Merv Griffin one.  It's like,  I am so clearly loaded.  But beyond,  but the part that's tough  is that I had no sense of that.  That I didn't,  I didn't,  you know,  look at how I was like  this cocky, 
[03:12:30]  arrogant little,  I'm joking about  marital infidelity on the road.  And I looked at that footage  and I went,  I don't want my daughter  to see that.  You know,  let's,  let's take that out.  But then,  you know,  I had editing rights  and I thought,  if this is going to be  a film about recovery,  if it's going to be  a film about,  about recovery,  then you need to leave it in.  So,  you know,  it's if,  if this arrogant little bastard  could get,  could get his act together  and have the life  that I have,  then,  then anybody can.  There wasn't an inkling  that you were being  an arrogant guy  or did you have any, 
[03:13:00]  any close friends  or family that were like,  hey,  Paul,  you're kind of being a dick.  Oh yeah,  you know what,  what they said,  what they didn't say  that would have been  wonderful if they did.  What they did say  is Chris Caswell,  who was my piano player  and the music director  said,  you know,  I'm really worried about you.  You're doing,  you know,  like you're really  kind of losing it  to the,  to the drugs  and I fired him.  Oh right,  yeah,  you fired him.  I fired him,  yeah.  All right,  so people were kind of  gunshot him.  Yeah,  and the thing is  after I got sober,  I just,  you know,  went and threw my arms  around him  and went,  you were the one,  you know,  because there were  a lot of people  that were, 
[03:13:30]  even though I was a mess,  you know,  we were making a bunch  of money  and they were  kind of cool with it,  you know,  so.  Oh,  there are people  that,  that you were,  were close with,  burned bridges with  and then wouldn't  accept an apology  or a,  hey,  you know,  after your,  your recovery?  You know,  no,  I,  I,  well,  I have a,  like probably wife number  two would fall  into that category.  Those are special cases.  We were,  we were married  in sobriety,  so that's,  that,  I can't really say that.  I think that I was  really fortunate  that,  that the,  the people that, 
[03:14:00]  you know,  the,  my worst years,  I actually wasn't  around a lot of people.  I didn't,  you know,  I,  I just disappeared.  I went from doing  49,  48 Tonight Shows  to like within,  you know,  within a 10 year period  or whatever  to just,  I just pulled the plug,  you know.  Yeah.  So I didn't go out  and screw things up  so bad and all,  but,  but I have had situations  where I told somebody  I wanted to,  you know,  kind of getting out  of the cars  and after thought,  oh,  by the way,  I probably owe you  an apology  for the way  that,  that,  that I,  that I treated  what you,  while we were  working on Ishtar 
[03:14:30]  and the guy  that I was talking  to reached over  and grabbed the car door  and kind of shut  the door and said,  if you want to talk  about it,  let's really talk about it  and I was sort of like,  ooh,  I was,  I was,  I was sort of tossing  something like lightly away.  Right.  It was a major thing.  As an aside.  Wow.  I wasn't giving it the,  you know,  the,  the,  the respect  and the attention  it deserved.  I guess it.  Learning process.  You really wronged him  and he felt it?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  He felt it  and,  and,  and he said,  let's talk about  what it was like.  Wow.  In other words,  if you're going to do this, 
[03:15:00]  do it with,  with the,  the respect for the process  and the respect for me  instead of just sliding  out of the car.  Did you regret opening  your mouth at that moment?  Like,  I should have waited  until I saw it  to just go home  and take a leak and.  You know what?  I have,  I have to tell you something  that probably  the most important  one minute  out of this conversation  today is that minute  is to be able to say  on the air  that I really screwed  that up,  that process,  that it's kind of  a holy process  where you're putting  your life back together  and you have the opportunity  to turn to somebody  and straighten it out 
[03:15:30]  that I treated it  that lightly.  So that's,  that's,  that's really important to me  to be aware of that  and not do that again.  Did you have  the conversation with him  and.  Proper conversation.  Yeah,  and I heard about stuff  that I'd long forgotten.  That's got to be painful  to have to like.  Well,  there's an interesting,  there's this place  right between sleep  and wake  or like late at night,  you're almost,  maybe you don't have  experienced this.  It is like a mail slot,  you know,  it's like,  you're almost asleep  and a memory will click.  It's like,  it's like God's delivery. 
[03:16:00]  And all of a sudden  there's a memory  and you go,  oh my God,  I did that.  Oh,  sweet Jesus.  Did I,  oh my God.  And then you,  so then you'd straighten it out.  You go and you call that person  and you say,  I need to talk to you.  I owe you an amends  that may be a financial amends  that may be a whatever,  but it's an interesting process.  Apparently so.  I got a lot of phone calls to make.  That's Paul.  Do you talk to Barbara Streisand?  I called her after I got sober  and had one,  one serious conversation 
[03:16:30]  with her about the way that I,  you know,  I mean,  I was so flippant about where,  you know,  when I'm a,  when I get scared,  I get noisy and funny,  you know?  So I mean,  at least I did then.  I thought I was noisy.  I was certainly noisy.  I thought I was funny,  but I'd be very kind of flippant.  And Carson asked me,  what's it like to work with Streisand?  And my line was,  it's like trying to have a picnic  at the end of a runway,  you know,  which is funny.  But the fact is then in sobriety,  I looked at the time  that I spent working with her  and for her.  And,  you know,  like she said,  what do you need to be comfortable? 
[03:17:00]  I said,  I'd like to have macadamians  and white wine  at my fingertips at all times.  And I just said that.  And the next day,  I went to her house  and there were macadamia nuts  next to every chair,  you know,  and great quantities  of white wine.  But,  but so she bent over backwards  to make sure  that I was comfortable  in,  in a working situation.  She had,  we had seven weeks  to write the entire score  for the,  for a star is born.  So it was a highly  charged experience.  But,  you know,  I,  I think I was unfair to her.  I think,  I think that in the, 
[03:17:30]  in the interest of looking  like I was unimpressed,  probably inspired by the fact  that I was totally impressed  and scared to death.  Right,  right,  right.  But again,  that wasn't a conscious thought then.  That's looking back  and you go,  oh,  what was going on?  Because then I,  I mean,  even before I was a celebrity  or famous or anything,  I,  when things were really bad  in my life,  they were fine.  It's like,  I was fine.  I was five years sober  when I went,  oh my God,  you had a horrific childhood.  You should have been sad a lot.  Let's start now.  Okay,  well,  but, 
[03:18:00]  but,  but it's interesting,  the process,  you know,  you look back  and you begin to understand  why you do things  that are pretty unconscious.  I got a,  I got a follow-up question.  So you guys write Evergreen.  Yeah.  An amazing song.  It won the Oscar that year.  Oscar,  Grammy and the Golden Globe.  And you guys never really worked.  Like pulling teeth  to get that out of her.  I was going to do it for you.  But then you never worked  with her again,  right?  No,  we never did anything after that.  That is so weird.  Yeah,  yeah.  And were you the problem  are you saying here today?  I'd like to think so.  I'd like to think so.  Yeah, 
[03:18:30]  you know,  yeah,  I think so.  But you would think  she'd want to go back,  you know,  considering what you guys did.  She actually recorded  several songs after that  and it was very kind.  She,  on her,  I wrote a song called  Love Dance  with Yvonne Linz.  Turn up the quiet,  love wants to dance.  That was on her album  Before Last,  I think was,  yeah,  she actually recorded it twice  with a small group  and with a,  with a,  with a really large,  much beautiful orchestra.  But,  and then she recorded  a song that Kenny Asher  and I wrote with her  called Answer Me  on an album after.  You know, 
[03:19:00]  she,  she was really sweet to me.  She recorded a bunch of tunes  even after  the Stars' Born Experience.  When you say like,  okay,  you're going to write  a movie score together,  they tell you,  you need X amount of songs  for this movie.  How do you,  how do you begin to think  of a song  for a moment in a movie  that isn't just literally  enunciating what's happening  in that moment in the movie?  And then the driving.  Like,  how do you avoid doing that?  Well,  you have two things.  You have the script  which tells you what's going on  and the thing which,  as you just pointed out, 
[03:19:30]  which also have the characters  of the,  you know,  the people that you're writing for,  you know.  So,  I mean,  with,  with,  with Kermit,  why are there so many?  So,  we even write in Kermit Speak,  why are there so many songs  about rainbows?  With the rhythm of the light.  I think that,  that what's most important  is that the song  kind of moved the action along.  that replaces the dialogue there  and moves the action along?  This is really going to be boring.  No,  it's,  it's called,  it's called creativity  and talent,  Jim.  You can't just say,  hey,  write a song for a movie 
[03:20:00]  and then anyone can do it.  But you know what,  here's the brilliance  of Jim,  of Jim Henson.  I love Gonzo.  So,  they're right,  in the story,  they're trying to make it  out to Hollywood  to become rich and famous.  The car breaks down  in the middle of the desert.  They're around a campfire  and everybody is just,  is just like,  we've,  you know,  Kermit's like,  I blew it.  I've failed everybody.  Spoiler alert,  by the way,  spoilers.  Yeah,  man.  You know,  but the fact,  give it a few more years.  But,  but the fact is  that,  that I looked at,  with Kenny  and we went,  looked at Gonzo  and went,  Gonzo, 
[03:20:30]  let's have Gonzo  just look at that sky.  I mean,  because I've been out  in the desert,  I mean,  in the middle of the night  many times  and you look at that sky  and Gonzo  is a landlocked bird  and I think  we're all landlocked birds.  That's why I love skydiving.  I love the way it felt  to be in free fall.  I love that.  I think we're landlocked birds.  So we wrote this song.  I'm going to go back there someday.  I've never been there,  but I know the way.  I'm going to go back there someday.  There's not a word yet.  For old friends who just met,  we wrote this song that is,  I mean,  it was just, 
[03:21:00]  it was all about Gonzo's experience,  spiritual awakening,  looking at that sky.  And Jim Hansen,  when he heard it,  he went,  I don't know.  We said,  well,  we recorded it anyway  and he listened to it.  He went,  what if we did this?  What if we had Gonzo  buy a bunch of balloons  at a fair scene  and experience flight?  So there is an actual,  factual reason  for him to be reflecting  on having experienced flight.  And then he put it in the movie.  It was just,  you know,  it's a collaborative process.  And how it works, 
[03:21:30]  if I,  I don't know,  there's a,  the big amigo  is a much better writer  than I am.  I just try to stay  out of the way,  you know.  But you jumped out  of a plane.  A hundred times.  We were just talking  about that last week  on the show.  I just don't know  how you do that.  You know what?  I loved it.  I loved it.  Are you scared every time?  At the time?  Are you scared every time?  Because we talked  to a few guys  and they said,  to this day,  I'm scared when I jump  out of a plane,  even though I've done  it numerous times.  You always get,  you know,  it cleans your windshield.  You know,  of course,  you have to realize 
[03:22:00]  the time I was using,  I was in the middle  of a chemistry experiment.  Oh, my God.  You know,  so if 80 seconds  of free fall,  I jumped with the  Golden Knights.  I was past a baton  in free fall  by the Golden Knights,  the Army free fall team  and all.  Do you feel like  you're falling  or do you feel  like you're floating?  I'll tell you  what it feels like.  Do you ever put  your arm out the window  of the car  and play with the air?  It feels like that  all over your body.  There's no sensation  of,  because of the relative wind,  there's no sensation  of falling at all.  If you jump out  of a balloon  or off like a bridge,  then you get that thing  in the pit of the stomach.  I never did that.  I always jump 
[03:22:30]  from a moving aircraft,  so you don't really  get that and all.  But it was just,  you know,  in those days,  in the DC-3,  we'd have a little bump  just to kind of make sure  we were wide awake,  have a little bump  to make sure  everybody's wide awake.  So 80 seconds  of free fall  would seem like  a summer vacation.  It was like,  because your mind's  going,  you know.  I couldn't imagine  how fast your heart  would be beating  between a blow  and jumping out  of a goddamn plane.  What's really interesting  is they've done experiments  they find with 
[03:23:00]  seasoned skydivers  that the heart rate  gets below normal  in free fall.  Really?  Pulls it way down.  Wow, no kidding.  Exactly.  I couldn't imagine.  Except for the ones  that you hear this,  oh my God!  Yeah, screaming, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  That would be us.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  You might surprise yourself.  You might do it once  and realize that this stuff works.  The physics are your friend,  but, you know,  the shoot's going to work for you.  There are,  you've told a lot of stories  about how you've been on shows  and don't remember  doing them or anything.  Is there, like, 
[03:23:30]  one of the most embarrassing moments  that you could remember  watching, like,  now in sobriety  and going,  holy shit.  Oh, yeah,  the Merv Griffin show.  It was the Merv Griffin show.  Merv Griffin show.  The Merv Griffin show.  It was just, you know,  and it's just,  and it's just,  you know what?  It wasn't even a matter  of getting out there  and, I mean,  I've forgotten the words  on shows.  I've done all that stuff  that normal people do sometimes.  Right, right, right.  But what's tough  is to look at yourself  when you're just being cocky,  arrogant,  inconsiderate,  and looking at, like,  hey,  have I got it together? 
[03:24:00]  And you look at it now  and you go,  boy,  not only did you not  have it together,  but, you know,  you are as unlikable.  You know,  the thing is that,  you know,  I love life  and I love people  and, you know,  and at this point,  life is likable to me.  You know,  I mean,  I don't know  if I'm likable to everybody,  but life is likable to me.  I love my life  and I'm grateful.  That's why we're doing the book,  Gratitude and Trust.  But to look at that  and to see this guy  who is just so full of self 
[03:24:30]  and so unlikable  is really hard to watch.  Jeez.  I'm amazed  that that was a decade,  a full decade  of acting like that.  Well, I'm not sure I,  I mean,  you're having to catch me on it,  really, you know.  And again,  I was probably scared to death  because I wasn't feeling it  because I was so totally loaded.  Right, right.  I had probably just lost  a ton of weight  because I was skinny  and I had my little mustache  and I was going,  oh, God, you know,  you're Frank Sinatra  crossed with Clark Gable  or, you know, 
[03:25:00]  and your audience is going,  who's Clark Gable?  You were,  you were the coolest guy  in the room, right?  According to yourself.  According to me,  I look at him now,  I was just a major asshole.  Paul Williams got to go.  He's a busy man.  They're saying you got to go.  He's promoting.  Oh, my goodness.  I think you got other stuff to do.  Yeah, I do.  I have another show to do.  Thank you for one more time.  And I love my birthday call.  Thank you.  We loved doing it.  We thought obvious. 
[03:25:30]  We thought you were going  to be a little upset about it.  You're very cordial.  No, no.  I'm not kidding.  I was thrilled.  I was thrilled.  You guys remembered.  And Anthony sang  The Love Boat  on your phone the other day.  The Love Boat.  You didn't answer that time.  Actually, I do like that one.  Just an old-fashioned love song  coming down in three-part harmony.  Someday I want to come back  and I want to interview that guy.  Oh, man.  We should do a duet.  Yeah.  Just an old-fashioned love song  coming down in three-part harmony.  It's an old-fashioned love song. 
[03:26:00]  Thank you, guys.  It's a true show.  Thanks, Paul.  Paul, thanks so much, man.  Always a pleasure.  You're great, man.  You guys are amazing.  And we barely promoted it,  but it's the 35th anniversary  of the Muppet movie.  Yeah, it's being re-released  out now on Amazon and iTunes.  There you go.  And it's I am Paul Williams  on Twitter.  At I am Paul Williams.  And what's the website again?  Gratitude and trust.com.  Gratitude and trust.  Gratitude and trust.com.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Come back and see us.  Paul, thanks so much, man.  Great. 
[03:26:30]  Appreciate it.  No problem.  You're in the wheel.  There he goes.  He's got like a great head  of hair on him still.  And I don't dye it.  What the hell?  And really?  Come on.  That's like your natural hair,  color, and hair.  And hair color, exactly.  Man.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's amazing.  See, the cocaine did something right.  Kept that hair healthy.  He's fantastic, man.  I love him.  What a sober guy he is.  Yes.  I really admire him.  He's a very, very sober guy.  He's one of those guys that if he ever went back  to boozing and drugs, that you'd be like, 
[03:27:00]  there's no hope.  Yeah.  For anybody.  Yeah.  Right.  Because he really seems to have pulled himself together.  And embraced it.  He's still as creative as ever.  And like you said, loves life.  Yeah.  That's fucking great.  Very nice, man.  That's great.  Listen, it's Wednesday, so it's podcast day.  The Opie and Anthony podcast, episode number 21.  We dug deep.  We got the wheelchair Fred bit.  Oh, the dildo one?  The dildo in the bathtub bit. 
[03:27:30]  That is fucking disgusting.  It really is.  We haven't played it in years,  so it's up on our podcast this week.  And we also have James Caan telling Godfather stories.  Yes.  And then I think the nugget is Brother Joe doing the Godfather theme on his guitar.  Really, really fucking solid version of that.  Yes.  Go get it.  And I'll be here for another 45 minutes doing an advice show.  Oh, we stepped on Jimmy's advice show.  Oh, Jimmy.  So good.  Sober talk with Paul Williams.  Somebody's going to fucking not call and get into trouble because they didn't get your advice. 
[03:28:00]  In October 25, 26, I'm in Rochester at the Comedy Club.  Right.  Copey and Anthony have left the building, but Jim Norton is not going anywhere.  If you have problems and a phone, it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor.  And your chance to speak directly with him has arrived. 
[03:28:30]  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  You know, normally, I like to start this program and talk for a second.  But I figure with the phone lines, as lit as they are, why not go right to...  Oh, that's right.  No one wanted to recall again. 
[03:29:00]  We had Paul Williams on the Opie and Anthony show.  And I was saying at the end, this was three minutes ago, what a sober guy he is.  We can turn the theme song down.  How long are we going to let it play for?  Sorry, I'm trying to answer the phone.  Roper's fucking concert.  He's just a sober guy.  He's a very spiritual, grateful guy.  Yeah, I envy his sobriety and his state of being. 
[03:29:30]  He's very good.  His state of mind is very good.  I find myself to be far less pleasant with my travels.  I was on the flight last night.  It's such a cliche thing.  And I finally fell asleep because, you know, I've had my sleeping woes.  And I'm awakened by...  This fucking...  Basically the equivalent of a six-year-old load.  Just screaming and crying.  And the father talking to the kid. 
[03:30:00]  And I'm like, ugh.  But I guess I was like, it's really hard being a parent.  And I don't envy that shit.  But, oh, was I irritated.  You want to stand up and just go, shut that fucking kid up.  But you can't because, you know...  Were they at least trying?  It's hard to say.  They were right behind me.  I was just, you know...  What could you do?  It might have been the descent, too.  Let's see here.  Dex likes his women to beat on him.  Hi, Dex.  Hello, Jim.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Well, it's kind of a weird, long story here. 
[03:30:30]  We'll see if you can give us the abridged version.  Yeah, well, I've been with a woman for 17 years.  And we've kind of been having issues and stuff here.  I think I've been the one that's been feeling a little heartbroken just over the shit that's going on.  And the only way that seems to be getting better here, and it's actually been a real turn on, is she just started, you know...  I knew she wanted to take something out on me, so I let her start, you know, just kind of slap me around when we were fucking. 
[03:31:00]  And, man, it really, really turns me on.  I can't even describe it.  Did your mother hit you when you were a kid?  No, not at all, no.  And even when she would play, slap me around and stuff, I didn't like it.  But the issues we've been having were, you know, she's never cheated on me and stuff.  But we kind of, you know, we were kind of swingers in the past.  You know, just find the right person and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  But now she's, you know, she's been getting a lot of tattoos lately, which is no problem. 
[03:31:30]  I love them.  That's great.  But she's kind of developed something for this tattoo guy that she's been going to.  And she wanted me to have a three-year-old asking if he wanted to do a three-way with us.  And I was never comfortable in having our friends, you know, everyone needed to be a stranger.  Sure.  So I didn't have to worry.  But now...  What's that noise in the background?  Is that your radio?  Yeah, that might have been the low mood on you.  I'm sorry. 
[03:32:00]  I kicked that off.  So now the issue is...  So since all this has kind of come up, the only way I'm dealing with this, and it really helps,  is when she smacks you around.  She was just straddling me over.  Hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  All right.  I get it.  You like to be smacked.  I don't mind it sometimes, too.  A little choking.  Is it because you're hurt that she wants somebody else,  said you don't know how to express that.  So this is kind of helping that hurt?  Exactly.  That's exactly what... 
[03:32:30]  And I don't know where this leads in the future,  because she was just straddling me on the couch.  We're just playing over the weekend.  And she was smacking me in the chest with the bell.  She had it wrapped around her head, around her hand, you know.  It had about a foot and a half, you know, sticking out.  And she was just smacking me in the chest with it.  And it was just such a turn on, because I knew we couldn't go fuck because she's on her period.  I mean, we could, but...  Well, if you like it, dude, look, if you like it and she likes it, it's fine. 
[03:33:00]  If it's only being used because it's kind of reflecting real hurt, well, then it might be an issue.  But, you know, tell her that you don't want to have a threesome with the tattoo guy.  Don't do it, because once you see it, you can never unsee it.  Right, right.  And I've seen it before.  We've met under extreme circumstances, you know, 25 years ago.  But I mean the friend, the fact that it's a friend and you don't want to do it.  And that's kind of what I told her.  I said, I could do it with you, but it would really, you know, and we have a handful of kids, I mean. 
[03:33:30]  And I said, I could do it with you, but it would probably be the end.  I mean, I don't know if there's something...  And see, she rode with me a couple weeks ago when it was the guys calling in and talking about the other, you know, their wives fucking other guys and shit.  And so she hurried, you know, the whole hour with me while we were at work.  And, you know, that...  And so since then, it's probably progressed, you know, worse and worse.  And I could do that with her, just not with somebody that she...  I understand, yes.  Of course, I don't blame you.  I got...  Dude, I got to let you go because we got a bunch of calls.  Thanks for the help, buddy. 
[03:34:00]  You're welcome, buddy.  But yeah, I understand that, too.  Like, even when I would have those fantasies with girls, I never wanted to picture them fucking anybody I knew.  It was more pornographic.  I didn't want a personality attached to it.  Chris in New Hampshire, a serial cheater.  What, are you having sex with the Cheerios?  No, Jim.  Fuck yeah.  I actually relocated the entire family up to New Hampshire because I just...  You know, I'd see an attractive girl.  I would hit on her. 
[03:34:30]  I would see how she responded.  And eventually, it would turn into something of a relationship.  And, you know, where we used to live, it happened probably 10 or 12 times over a six-year period.  And then now, I've moved up here, and the same thing is starting to happen again.  Well, there's an old expression.  Wherever I went, there I was.  That's...  You're not going to change...  You do what they call...  When alcoholics do it, it's called a geographic.  You're not going to change who you are because you change your area code. 
[03:35:00]  If you don't want to cheat, you have to work on why you're cheating.  Do you go to therapy?  I did go to therapy down where we were, but not since I've been up here.  I figured...  I thought since there was very little opportunity up here...  No, you'll find it.  You'll find the opportunity.  Yeah.  Do you think you're a sexual addict?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, then that's what you should...  If it's bothering you and it's making your life unmanageable, and it's causing you to  move your family and have them uproot and find new friends and your kids to go to new 
[03:35:30]  schools if you have kids...  Well, you know, then maybe you should think that your dick is getting everyone in trouble  and your dick is inconveniencing your family, and you've basically taken your children  away.  How old are they?  Almost four and almost two.  Okay.  So they don't have a whole lot of friends.  But you've taken them out of their environment, or you've taken your wife away from her friends  because you can't stop cheating.  So instead of uprooting everybody, why don't you try addressing the sex addiction?  Yeah.  And I think the thing is that I don't know how to address that with the therapist, is that 
[03:36:00]  we talk it out, but the reality is I think when I go seeking out these other people, it's  a confidence issue, but it isn't like that's what's lacking in the house.  My wife is a very loving and complimentary person, but it's like the minute a girl gives  me the wink or the smile or whatever, something just clicks, and it's like, boom, I want that. 
[03:36:30]  Well, most men are weaker than women when it comes to this stuff.  But it's also about, you know, if it's an addictive behavior, you're not going to find  logic with it.  It's almost like when someone is 400 pounds, there's no logical reason why they're shoving  cake into their face.  It's because it's part of an addiction.  So if it's a sex addiction, well, even if a girl doesn't wink, we still get interested.  But if she does wink, we don't know how to say no.  It's always been hard for me to say no.  Like, I think I have X amount of pussy lined up. 
[03:37:00]  And if I say no and turn it down, I can never get it back.  And I'm passing it up.  It's like a true addict.  And it's like, who gives a fuck?  I've been rejected.  You think every girl that rejects me thinks I'm turning that dick down?  Well, yes, that's why they do it.  Why can I never walk away from pussy?  Part of it is low self-esteem.  You're finally getting what you couldn't get in high school, whatever it is.  But a big part of it is just being selfish.  I want what I want when I want it.  It's greed.  Grabbing for more than my share of everything.  And I'm guilty of that, too. 
[03:37:30]  But if you've got a family, I would suggest addressing the addiction.  And, you know, you address it with you.  You have to be willing to do something about it.  You know, you can't just talk about it.  You've got to be willing to do something about it.  I'm talking to me, by the way.  So, you know, that's what I would suggest.  Maybe go to a 12-step meeting and talk to your therapist about it.  But for real.  Thank you, Jim.  Okay, buddy.  Good luck.  Let's see here.  Jack in Georgia.  A girl goes to the bar and picks up a guy.  And you hide in the closet.  Oh, your girlfriend does?  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  This is fucking awesome.  It's the greatest thing.  We just started doing it a couple months ago.  And I'm 52.  She's 25.  Yay.  We both wear Bluetooth headsets, right?  And we keep in contact with each other at the bar so I can hear all the conversation.  And the dude doesn't know that I'm watching.  So, you always get a motel room where there's a lounge downstairs.  And then she picks up on him.  I'm listening in.  I know what's going on.  I head up to the room and I'm high.  And they come in and they fuck while I'm watching. 
[03:38:30]  And he doesn't know it.  And the part that's about it that he doesn't know it is the greatest part because then everything's natural, you know?  Well, if you want to put a stop to that, watch the first episode of Game of Thrones this year.  I mean, Burwock Empire.  You know, I understand that that's, to me, a bit of a dangerous game because, you know, the guy has been drinking.  You don't know him.  He doesn't know she's with somebody.  It could get violent or he could freak.  You could sneeze and he could freak out because you're in the closet.  I know.  I farted once, too. 
[03:39:00]  Do you have a gun?  Yes, I do.  With you?  Georgia, buddy.  You carry it.  I got a concealed carry.  Oh, okay.  So you have a gun in the closet.  You better believe it.  Okay, that's fine.  Then you know what?  That's fine.  Public defender is a cannon.  Okay.  No, that's good, dude.  If you, because this way if it gets out of hand or if he's drunk and he starts hitting her, you can protect him with the, you know, you can protect her and yourself.  Okay.  Then enjoy.  All right, buddy.  Have fun.  Good for you.  Now I'm going to be careful.  If anyone in Georgia tries to fuck me in a motel, I'm going to have to peek in the closet first. 
[03:39:30]  Hope I don't see this psycho with his dick out and his fucking giant desert eagle.  All right.  Let's see here.  Jason in Virginia.  I have a cuckold experience.  I think I fucked up.  Hi.  Hey, Jim.  How you doing, man?  Good.  How are you?  I'm doing good.  Hey, let me go from the beginning.  We've been there for like 13 years.  I've always, you know, fucking jokes around.  Hey, man, let's do this.  Let's do that.  It even got so far as where, you know, role play with a guy she worked with.  All good, right? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, I kind of laid off of it because she wasn't into the real thing.  Well, the real thing happened.  You know, I said she called her ex-boyfriend up, went and met him in a hotel, and did it.  And what were you doing?  Fucking took the kids to a movie.  Why?  Exactly.  Wait, wait, wait.  What do you mean?  Did you want to do that or she wanted to?  No, I didn't want anything to do with it.  You let her just go fuck her ex-boyfriend? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Why?  Well, I don't know, dude.  I don't know.  I mean, were you turned on by the pain of it?  See, I don't, yeah, I was thrilled.  We came, she came home.  Oh, my God, yeah, we fucked again, and I ate her out and all that kind of stuff.  But the more I thought about it, the more it just gave me an empty feeling inside and  it killed me, man.  What were you thinking about in the movie theater while you were watching the movie with the  kids? 
[03:41:00]  Oh, God, I couldn't even think about the movie.  I went to watch Grown Ups 2, and the whole movie was ruined because I couldn't think about  it.  I was thinking about them the whole time.  Were you turned on or depressed?  I don't know.  I was turned on at first.  I really was.  And then, you know, like I said, when she got home and told me what happened, it was cool.  The next day, it was okay.  I was like, oh, my God.  Well, okay, so that beside the point, that's all cool.  I said, look, I don't want that to happen again.  I'm done with that.  Well, she even emailed this guy and talking some dirty, foul shit. 
[03:41:30]  I mean, talking like, oh, I want to fuck your dick.  And then they even went as far as saying, hey, you know, we can meet up sometime.  And I found out about it, and I hit the roof.  So she's doing this shit behind your back.  Yeah, kind of, yeah.  Well, that's dirty.  I mean, so it's not a real cuckolding thing like you're participating in.  And she's basically kind of getting you to sign up for the fact that she's going to cheat.  And you should never do this stuff if it's going to be painful because sometimes what happens with couples or myself even as a single guy, you start to feel numb. 
[03:42:00]  And when you feel numb, you feel nothing.  So we want to feel something.  And sometimes letting somebody fuck somebody else is a way to feel something because that something is going to be hurt or that longing or that I'm losing this person.  Sometimes we just want to feel something.  And I think that's the wrong reason to do it.  But it sounds to me like you guys are in a bit of trouble if you catch her doing it.  She's already fucked her ex-boyfriend, and then you catch her doing this shit.  That's bad.  Well, I mean, and I said, look, you know, because I kind of didn't monitor her emails. 
[03:42:30]  And I said, look, it's got to stop.  And it has stopped.  I even emailed him.  I said, look, dude, no more of this bullshit.  No.  So, but, I mean, I honestly think that she won't do that again.  But it's still just an empty void, I feel now.  Yeah.  I don't blame you, dude.  And the problem, I mean, my real issue is, you know, I got, you know, an ED problem, too.  So, you know, a lot of times I do feel bad because, you know, she's 40 years old.  She wants to have sex.  And I'm like, I'm not interested. 
[03:43:00]  That could be a problem, too, because they're hitting their peak, and you want to fucking doze off.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  Yeah, so, I mean, yeah.  Well, I would suggest, again, if she's, how long are you married?  14 years now, actually.  I guess that's a while.  Yeah, since 99.  If you feel, it's a problem if you feel like she wants to fuck a lot more than you, and then that puts pressure on you because you're afraid if you don't, she's going to start emailing people and go fuck somebody else.  Exactly, yes. 
[03:43:30]  Well, eat her box.  Yeah, I'm pretty good, Dad.  I can do that.  All right, well, make sure you do it more.  I can do that.  All right, buddy.  See you later.  John in Texas, loves anal with his girlfriend, but she shits every time.  Mr. Norton, it is a pleasure to talk with you, sir.  Thank you, John.  Yeah, every time.  And I don't have a problem with it.  Oh, okay.  She gets kind of embarrassed by it, but is it natural?  I mean, this is the first girl that I've ever had that was wanting to do it as much as she does. 
[03:44:00]  I've had it happen, but what you've got to do is get her an enema and have her do an enema first.  Okay.  And that should clean her out.  But, yeah, I've had that happen a few times with girls where you're fucking, and all of a sudden, the next thing you know, your fucking dick is wearing an Abe Lincoln hat.  I would just have her take an enema first.  All right.  I'll talk with her about it.  Pleasure talking with you, sir.  All right, buddy.  Enjoy.  Let's see.  Mark in New Jersey, career advice.  He's a performer.  Hi, Mark. 
[03:44:30]  Hey, what's going on, Jim?  How are you?  My problem basically relies on I'm sort of succeeding in my career, or I don't know.  It's kind of a blurry line whether I'm succeeding or failing, but my personal life just seems to be completely fucked up.  And if I'm not either in New York trying to promote myself as a artist, I'm just in my room thinking of killing myself.  I'm not going to do it, but it's...  What kind of performer?  I'm a rapper, actually.  Okay, so you're a rapper, and you're getting some work?  I'm not some work.  I'm getting showcases and getting spots and open mics. 
[03:45:00]  It's in the city.  Okay, but your personal life is not where you want it to be.  It's completely fucked up.  Just gone.  Well, that's the truth with a lot of performers.  How old are you?  I'm 24, and that's what I was asking you, because you, in my eyes, made it as a performer, and you seem to have managed that.  It's a lot of suffering and sacrifice, and I know I got, like, you know, however many more years down the line.  Sure, sure.  And, you know, I gave up everything, and I don't mean that dramatically.  I mean just, you know, everything came second to performing. 
[03:45:30]  And, you know, we all have personal lives that get fucked up.  Mine still is sometimes.  But just try to use it in your work.  That's the only thing that gave me solace is that I could take whatever was going wrong, and I could use it in stand-up or in my, you know, or I could talk about it now on the radio.  If I have a disastrous personal experience, I can now come on the show and talk about it, or I can do a joke about it.  So you can use it in your work because you're creative.  Imagine fucking accountants.  They can't use that in their life and in their work.  They can't use their shitty, you know, I jerked off again stories in their work. 
[03:46:00]  But we can use that stuff.  So at least be grateful you're in a job where it's going to help you.  So I would just.  What's that?  Mark Random Ford.  Google that.  Okay, buddy.  Had to get the plug in.  Love you, Jim.  Thank you, man.  Good luck with you.  Good luck with you.  Good luck to you.  Let's see.  Joe in Texas.  Obsession problem with someone on social media.  Hi, Joe.  Hi, Jim. 
[03:46:30]  I enjoy your comedy on O&A, and you're just a genius.  Oh, it's very nice of you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I got this Twitter friend of mine, but she just got rid of her account, and I've just been stalking her on Facebook.  And then finally, she just got rid of Facebook, too, but she doesn't know I've been stalking her.  And she's this girl that lives in England, and I've just been obsessed with her ever since. 
[03:47:00]  It's been a year now since I've actually talked to her.  It's going to be in December.  But we DMed each other all the time, and I just had this just ridiculous Twitter crush on her.  And, you know, kind of like each other and stuff.  But how do I go about, like, actually going over there because I actually know the town issue?  Let's see.  He was doing a Bobo story, which is fine. 
[03:47:30]  That was that British girl.  I didn't mind that he was doing a Bobo story.  We're just pressed for time.  So I didn't object to your story, sir, but I knew what you were doing, and there are people asking real questions here, which is, again, I'm fine with fucking around, but we started 20 minutes late.  All right.  Let's see.  Biff in New York, a disabled guy at work, keeps calling you a racial slur.  Okay.  Hey, Jimmy?  Yes, Biff.  Hey.  All right.  What's going on there?  Hi, buddy.  All right.  These guys are working with us. 
[03:48:00]  Well, he's been working at the company at the hospital I work at for 25 years.  All right?  And everybody thinks he's, like, slow.  He's a little, you know, it's his excuse for everything.  He gets away with everything.  Okay.  All right.  So I was working late last weekend, last Friday.  I kind of stayed over.  And the guy starts calling.  He starts, you know, this Italian shitty starts saying, moving on, right?  And I'm like, okay, I'm 20.  Ha, ha, ha.  You're black?  Yeah, I'm a black guy.  But, you know, towards the reason, the guy's like, what's wrong with you niggas? 
[03:48:30]  Everything you do, you're ruined.  You do this.  You do that.  You move into the neighborhood.  And he starts saying some shit about making pizza, how black kids at Domino's are ruining  it for the Italians.  And I want to kind of spread this around town, around the work, but I don't know if I should.  It's like, you know, is he really, if he's disabled, I don't want to leave it alone, but  it's been bothering me.  Well, let me ask you.  Did you say anything to him about how you don't like it?  But he's a little slow, apparently.  And he talks like that. 
[03:49:00]  He's just kind of really rough.  Well, maybe if you talk to him nicely, if you think that it's genuine and he's not trying  to hurt you, he's just an ass, maybe if you talk to him, you will save his teeth from  getting knocked out someday in a bar.  Like, you work with him.  You know he has a reputation of being a bit of a dumbbell, but some stranger in a bar is  not going to know that.  Some guy in some waiter in a restaurant, when he goes, you know why the blacks always cause  is not going to know that.  So you may be helping him by telling him like, look, man, I know you're probably not trying 
[03:49:30]  to be this way, but this is how it's coming off.  And then if he continues to do it, well, fuck the fact that he's slow.  So you don't have to work in an environment where a guy's being a shithead to you, especially  once you've talked to him and said, look, this is why, you know, maybe you're right  not to overreact right now because you know, he's got something going on.  So you're being, you know, you're being cool about it.  But I think that if you have the discussion with him, you're A, doing yourself a service  and you're B, possibly saving him and ass kicking.  I was thinking maybe I should call him something back. 
[03:50:00]  I don't really know any good Italian racial slurs.  Just call him Anthony Cumia.  No Italian wants to be called that.  I would talk to him.  I would just talk to him.  All right.  You might, you actually might be helping him.  You seem like you're a together guy.  You know, he's obviously not.  You'd probably be helping him.  I mean, he said it in a really nasty way, though.  The way it was such a stinging nigger.  Like, it wasn't just nigger.  It was his niggas.  It's like he had that N.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:50:30]  With his nose and he threw it in there with a stick.  Well, talk to him again.  See where he's coming from.  Maybe he's not that slow.  Maybe he just, maybe he has a fucking, he sounds slow and he uses that just to say whatever  he wants.  But get a vibe from him.  Talk to him and see how he reacts.  It did sound like a, like a pent up rant.  I don't know what ticker triggered him off.  Like, I couldn't believe it.  I didn't tell anybody at work.  Well, again, talk to him and you'll, you'll get a much better read on him once you have  a nice discussion with him.  And he might, he might actually listen to you.  Or if he continues, then you go to whoever is running the place.  Cause you don't, you don't have to put up with that shit. 
[03:51:00]  All right, buddy.  All right, Jim.  Thanks a lot.  All right, my friend.  Good luck.  Uh, let's see Joe in Boston.  No women today.  All guys had a, uh, sexual triangle with an old flame and a new girl.  Yeah.  Do they both know about each other?  No, they don't.  Uh, this one girl who's coming in from, uh, California, I actually haven't, I haven't  actually seen for like two years.  Um, but when we were together, when she was here in Boston, we would have just crazy,  crazy, awesome, just disgusting sex, um, all the time. 
[03:51:30]  And I know she wants to hook up when she comes back here.  Um, but this other girl that I've been dating, uh, we've been out maybe, I don't know, like  10 or 11 times and I really like her.  Right.  Uh, we have, we haven't had sex yet, but I have a good feeling about her.  I feel like I might actually have some sort of a future with her.  Well, have you, have you said you're going to be exclusive with each other or are you not  there yet?  No, we're not there yet.  Okay.  So just don't mention it to her until, and you, you know, right now you're in that fucking gray  area where you're non-exclusive.  So you can probably get away with it. 
[03:52:00]  Just don't tell her.  And if it ever comes up, go, look, we weren't exclusive.  I didn't know what you were doing.  Just get it out of the way quick.  Bang this X another time and then fucking be done with her.  I would just still feel so guilty about it afterwards.  Oh, then don't do it.  Then don't do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've already fucked.  You could also look at it like this.  You've already fucked the other girl.  True.  Like, you know, it was fun, but it could be awful this time and just wreck your memories.  Just jerk off thinking about it.  All right.  That's actually a good idea. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  If you're already getting, if you're already saying, I'm going to feel guilty because I  like this girl, then you've made your decision.  This girl is more important to you than dumping a load with the other one.  So the potential for a good fuck is great, but you actually think there's something with  this girl.  So don't blow it on the out of town pussy because you'll regret it.  All right, cool.  All right, man.  Good luck.  Let's see.  Paul in Ohio seeking advice, dealing with a drinking problem.  Hi, Paul.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hello, buddy. 
[03:53:00]  I'm a big fan of you, big fan of the show, but I feel like I'm a compulsive liar with  a drinking and an eating problem.  And it's really starting to affect my wife that I've been with for a couple of years.  Yeah, I just, I drink a lot.  I hide it from her.  I hide eating from her and all garbage and junk food.  And I know you've been working out to me, right?  But yeah, you're like, I know what you're saying.  You're closet drinking or you're doing, I definitely understand.  Right.  You know, I just want to know, I mean, I hadn't had a drink in about four days and yesterday 
[03:53:30]  was a shit day at work.  And I sat down and I had a glass of wine.  I didn't go any further than that.  But I had a huge fucking Sunday from, you know, Dairy Queen.  Right.  And just to kind of like taper those emotions and the piss offness that I get.  Well, dude, let me say this.  We're all liars when we're in the addiction.  So that's not a shock.  When you're drinking, we lie about that.  We all lie about our addictions.  We all downplay it while we're active to protect the addiction. 
[03:54:00]  Have you, do you want to stop the drinking and stop the compulsive overeating?  I do.  So, okay, so what have you, what steps have you taken?  Calling you.  Okay.  I would say that's one step, but a better step, a better action would be to, again, go  to, you know, go online, find a 12-step group you like for either program and give it a shot.  I would suggest the alcohol first.  The food is bad, but you're not going to drive into a pole driving home from a restaurant. 
[03:54:30]  I would suggest beginning to address the alcohol first and foremost.  Right.  I, you know, I tried to talk to my wife about it and, you know, she just thinks that I'm  being selfish.  You know, she's right in a way, but what she says doesn't mean a fucking thing because she's  not a sober male.  You want to try to talk to a guy who's in recovery who can go to a meeting with you and  talk to you.  You know, she's not going to be able to help you there.  This is one you have to do with the help.  But she could support you, but you have to go, I would suggest, a 12-step group. 
[03:55:00]  Okay.  Right on.  That's the step.  Okay, buddy?  Thank you.  Good luck, man.  Let's see here.  Ben in North Carolina.  Difference between sex addiction and drug addiction.  Yes, sir, Jim.  Just, I kind of wanted to give your opinion on this.  I'm an opiate addict and I'm also, I love sex.  I mean, I think about it, want it nonstop.  But I'm having, I hear this argument all the time.  I mean, I'm having a hard time understanding, you know, when I don't have pills or, you know, 
[03:55:30]  I mean, I get sick and want to beat my head against the wall.  And then I hear people say they're sex addicts and I just, I'm trying to understand that.  I mean, what's your opinion on it?  Because I just don't see it as an addiction, but I'm trying to understand.  It's the same.  It's the same thing.  It's just different substances.  Like, there's physical withdrawals and stuff from alcohol and from, you know, from all this stuff.  But the difference is also, like, okay, you don't get physically sick and vomit when you're not acting out sexually. 
[03:56:00]  But, well, it's just, it's the same thing.  It's the same result you're getting.  It's this dopamine drip in your brain.  The reasons for doing it are the same.  It zones us out.  It takes us out of the present.  It's an escape.  It's just a fucking, it's a numbing, avoid the present behavior.  And it's not like, you know, it's not how much you drank or how much drugs you did.  It's what it did to you.  So if it makes your life unmanageable, if both of those things make your life unmanageable and you're doing them for the wrong reasons, then maybe you can see the tie-in. 
[03:56:30]  I mean, I don't know what your sexual behavior is like.  Oh, is he gone?  A lot of people have trouble seeing sex as an addiction because it's a natural instinct.  But nobody has a problem seeing food as an addiction.  Like, you know, some people go, I just quit eating.  But, you know, which, you know, that is the basics of it.  But when you're compulsively overeating, people know that there's something wrong with you. 
[03:57:00]  People know that you got some kind of a fucking problem.  Same thing with sex.  Sex and food are harder than drugs.  So if you're not too sure, you know, if drugs and sex are the same thing, say, yes, they are.  But food and sex are harder to recover from because you cannot be abstinent.  Drugs, as much as you might puke, get off of drugs.  They get out of your system.  You go to meetings.  You don't have to do them anymore.  It's out.  But, you know, try fucking going out to a restaurant while you're trying to eat healthy and you have, you know, a steak with no butter and some steamed vegetables and the chick you're with has a fucking banana cream pie. 
[03:57:30]  And, you know, it's like much harder.  Oh, just have a bite.  You know, it's much harder to eat healthy.  So whatever.  But I don't mean to babble.  But they are the same thing.  Just different substances.  Oh, my God.  One more call quick.  Oh, no time.  Fuck.  Jim in Long Island with the obsession for incest porn.  That you can't shake.  Try to call back next week.  Okay.  Because I will talk to you about that. 
[03:58:00]  We just started late and we have to end.  Friday, Saturday, October 25, 26.  I'm at the Comedy Club in Rochester.  There's only four shows because I'm taping a TV show the day before.  And Friday, November 1st, I'm with Dice at The Beacon, Ticketmaster.com.  And, of course, the comedy cabaret is sold out.  Thanks a lot, everybody.
