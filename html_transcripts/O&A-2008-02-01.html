<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a rejection of the pressure to be "nice" on radio, immediately transitioning into a discussion about *Lost*, including a spoiler-free season premiere summary from a caller.  This segued into a conversation about the challenges of DVRs for television advertising.  The hosts then launched into a profanity-laced tirade against Eli Manning and the New England Patriots, expressing their general contempt for overly enthusiastic sports fans.  They followed this with humorous commentary on awful male enhancement infomercials and what they considered the worst Super Bowl songs ever. A bit featuring comedian Bob Kelly’s infatuation with Tom Brady was played.  The show included listener calls discussing NFL team loyalties and the presidential primaries, along with a segment guessing political debate opinions based on demographics.  The broadcast featured an explicit description of sexually explicit online pictures from a show-associated website, eliciting strong reactions from the hosts. They concluded this section with commentary on a news story about the genetics of blue eyes and the LAPD’s response to paparazzi surrounding Britney Spears’s ambulance, noting Spears’s perceived decline.  Russell Peters’s cancelled appearance and Louis C.K.’s upcoming guest spot were mentioned.

The next segment focused on the fascination with self-destructive celebrities (Amy Winehouse, Sam Kinison, John Belushi, Chris Farley, Kurt Cobain, and Britney Spears), with caller input on Spears’s situation. Other topics included a 92-year-old golfer’s hole-in-one, terrible NFL rap songs (particularly the Miami Dolphins and L.A. Rams), and a humorous Elvis Presley clip.  In-studio guest Louis C.K. offered his perspective on the upcoming presidential election. The segment featured offensive and racially charged humor, listener suggestions (including a rejected "Take it out Tuesday" idea), and the announcement of a staff member attending a Knight Rider premiere party at the Playboy Mansion.  A "Black History Month" bit highlighting lesser-known African-American figures, starting with a muffler shop owner known for loud exhaust whistles, was introduced.  Further discussion of the L.A. Rams rap song and Louis C.K.’s tour dates concluded the segment.  Graphic internet pornography was also displayed and discussed, prompting reactions from the hosts and Louis C.K.

The broadcast continued with a chaotic mix: an unintelligible song fragment, a caller needing to deliver his six-year-old daughter's fecal samples to her pediatrician, and a Chris Berman clip showing him cursing during a commercial break.  The conversation shifted to Louis C.K.’s weight loss, a drunk driver calling 911, and the hosts' own legal anecdotes, including one host's jail time.  A news story about a stolen cement Jesus statue with a feces-related ransom note was discussed, followed by impressions of the news reporter. Calls and discussions about food waste in America versus Haiti, where people eat dirt cookies, along with personal anecdotes about food and bad restaurants, filled the airwaves.  The segment concluded with dream analysis involving murder and public transportation disasters, followed by plugs for Louis C.K.’s and Jimmy’s shows and a Playboy Mansion contest.

A segment followed that centered on listener-submitted anecdotes and the hosts' own stories about childhood experiences with defecation, urination, and early sexual experiences.  One host recounted an embarrassing bowel movement incident at his producer's future in-laws' home, and another shared a story of defecating in his underwear at Conan O'Brien's show. The discussion included wet dreams and bodily fluids.  A caller, Greg, recounted a story about using a dinner roll as toilet paper. Another listener shared the story of their dog consuming a used diaper.  A prolonged bit followed involving Dr. Steve performing an on-air prostate exam on Roland after significant negotiation and incentives.

The final segment featured Merrill Howard Kalin doing impressions (Jack Benny, Alfred Hitchcock, Porky Pig), and involved offensive jokes targeting various groups, including people with intellectual disabilities.   A weight-gain challenge among several individuals (Lily, Brock’s Johnny, Butcher, and Eastside Dave) was discussed, with graphic descriptions of their bodies and eating habits. The segment also included discussions of Merrill’s cooking show, listener emails, a bet on a Giants-Patriots game, and a listener's Sopranos tattoo.  Numerous references to sex, bodily functions, and other offensive topics were present, along with listener calls. The show ended with plugs for upcoming appearances and other shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  Jesus, I'm sorry.  Usually I'm alright.  That one is...  I've been dropping them all morning.  I can't help it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  My eyes are tearing. 
[00:01:00]  I think that celebrities, especially people like a Hugh Fledger...  This boring bitch makes Ambien look like methamphetamine.  This is where entertainment is going.  Shut up, you f***ing moron.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Die.  Die.  Die.  All right.  Wow.  If we pull this off, we're going to be...  What?  Employed.  Employed.  Employed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Yeah.  I reiterate.  I concur, actually.  Good morning.  Welcome to Black History Month.  Oh, it starts today. 
[00:02:00]  Welcome to What the Hell is Sam Month.  I don't know what it is.  February.  February.  February.  Can anyone say that right?  February.  Can everybody just say February?  February.  They don't take the...  They don't take that R seriously.  They don't take it serious.  February.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212.  O&A. 
[00:02:30]  We're off and running.  Rob from Long Island has a question for Anthony.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, big night last night.  What do you think about Long?  All right.  No one tune out.  Don't start going la, la, la, la if it's DVR'd and stuff.  I'm not going to say anything.  I'm not going to be a spoiler.  I'm just going to give a general overview.  I love the show, and I thought the premiere episode of this season was very cool, sticking  with the whole, you know, concept of the show, leaving you going, what? 
[00:03:00]  And just wanting to see more.  Don't ruin anything for anybody.  No, I won't, but do you think it'll be ruining anything if I say they're keeping with  the flash forward now?  I like that whole thing.  Yeah.  No, because I think that they can't really do any more of, you know, flashbacks because  you know everybody's story.  Yeah, unless they bring in new people, you know, then they'll go the flashback thing,  but the flash forward is kind of cool, you know? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I think now it's like the island, it's sort of like the flashback, and it's like, you  know...  Look, Jimmy's all irritated.  He's like, all right, I don't want to hear it.  Jimmy took his headphones off.  Just don't get into any...  I don't even want that many details.  I'm just saying...  Don't get into any details.  I thought it was really cool.  I was watching it on my computer while I was on the computer, and then it was also being  DVR'd upstairs, so then when I was done watching it, on upstairs, watched it again. 
[00:04:00]  Look at you.  Because you got to do that with that effing show.  It's a love-hate relationship, because you sit there, and then at the end it goes,  dong, and you see the lost logo come up, and you go, what?  Not that I thought they were going to tie it all up in the premiere episode of season  four, but you know, I love the show, and I hate it.  But I heard the fact that they were at a mall or something, just shopping, really, really 
[00:04:30]  took away from it this season.  Yes.  Yeah.  It turns out they were all just shopping at a mall.  Are they really lost, though?  Come on.  Let's be honest with each other.  I got to DVR it.  Now I had this first episode gone, so now if I go to watch this season, I'll have to...  I hope they re-show it.  You could probably get it off of iTunes.  That's what I did.  You could just download it.  I did it for the entire third season.  I just watched it all on iTunes.  Okay.  It's very handy.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not going to start talking about Lost, because I know when Ron and Fez were talking 
[00:05:00]  about it, before I would see the episodes, I turned the show off.  And I enjoy their show, but I was forced to turn it off, and I don't want people to do  that, because they didn't say we're not going to discuss Lost.  Well, we kind of turned the corner.  Back in the day, we would blow it for everybody.  Yeah.  But now, DVR is the way to watch TV, so we can't do it anymore.  I have so many shows that I love watching, and they're all just piled up on DVR, just  waiting for me.  I do those commercials. 
[00:05:30]  Zip, zip, zip.  But they try to get you at some...  Some commercials are pretty good at getting you.  Like, they put something in there.  Yeah.  Where if you're fast-forwarding through, you go, whoa, what the hell is that?  And then you've got to check it out.  Well, they're getting smarter.  They're adapting.  They know they can't get around the DVR and the fast-forwarding.  Like, I watch that dumb Biggest Loser show.  I don't even know why.  Makes me laugh.  Makes me teary-eyed.  Jesus.  Makes me want to just sit there and eat potato chips and realize how fortunate I am in my 
[00:06:00]  genetic makeup.  I'm not going to get that fat.  But what they're starting to do is they're starting to do commercials, but it's within  the show.  And halfway through, like, there's a little, like, minute or two segment, you're like,  wait a minute.  This has nothing to do with the show.  It's a commercial.  How to eat better.  But it's a product they're trying to push through the Biggest Loser show.  They all have to figure out different ways of doing commercials because people are DVRing.  They're finally doing it, though.  That and TV shows like the show that followed Lost looked like I didn't even want to watch 
[00:06:30]  it at all.  But then they go, stay tuned for a special message from Oceanic Airlines, you know, the  airline from Lost that crashed.  And I'm like, no, I don't want to stay tuned.  I don't want to watch this show.  So fast forwarded through the entire show, waiting to see the little Oceanic logo, saw  it, and the bastards put it right at the end.  But I didn't have to watch the show.  And then, you know, you see a little snippet and little hints and clues of this stupid 
[00:07:00]  show, Lost.  Yeah.  It was interesting.  I won't say anything to Jimmy.  No, you want to see it.  It was like interesting, yeah.  I'll say it's one show on TV that I watched, because I hadn't watched network TV in years,  that I really was impressed with.  Yeah.  Wow, this is a great show.  Yeah.  I got a box set, I think it was last Christmas, you know, all the box sets that were available,  and then my brother took him, and he hasn't given him back, so, you know, I haven't even 
[00:07:30]  seen one episode yet.  Yeah.  I want to catch up, and then I'll get the ones on iTunes, and then I'll finally, you  know, sometime in March or April, I'll be right there with you guys.  Yeah.  Because I do want to watch that show, and I still got the wire box set sitting on my  shelf.  And I don't know why I haven't started that yet.  I'm always weird with the new series, because I feel nothing for anybody in the show.  Well, yeah, you got to kind of build that up.  Yeah, so it's hard to get into, all of a sudden, go, all right, I'm going to commit  a few hours of my life to this, because there's nothing drawing you to it yet. 
[00:08:00]  Right, right.  And now that's stupid wire.  I'm actually watching it a week in advance on the dumb DVR.  You can watch it a week in advance on DVR.  Ooh.  What do you mean?  Does it cost you?  No, it's free.  Oh, okay.  What do you mean a week in advance?  How does that work?  Let's say episode one of the season will air Sunday.  Yeah.  The Sunday before.  Right.  Episode one, you can get on, I'm sorry, in demand.  Oh, yeah, okay.  It's free, but I think they're pushing that because eventually they're going to start  putting commercials or ads there.  For some reason, they're free.  Oh, so then if you want to see it early, you're going to have to pay by watching commercials 
[00:08:30]  or something.  I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  But I saw a commercial, it was sort of like a product, like one of the infomercials  was on Comedy Central late, late, late one night, and it was for like a male enhancement.  Yes.  And it was supposed to make you bigger, and it was a guy and an awful female co-host,  and it could be the worst thing I've ever seen.  I've never loved something so much.  Don't you just sit there and watch those?  And the more awful they are, the better.  It's late at night.  There's not anything on anyway.  And you sit and watch those bad infomercials with the bad acting. 
[00:09:00]  I like the ones that I have the live studio audience that are amazed at every single thing  that the stupid, phony hosts of this phony show they're trying to pull off as like a  TV show.  Welcome back.  Well, the commercial that you just played is for what you're selling.  Right.  We'll be right back after this message.  And then it's a commercial for the gadget they're selling, and then they come back.  Hey, we're back.  We're back.  We just had a commercial for what we're doing. 
[00:09:30]  Sometimes it's like a set of a talk show.  Sometimes it's just someone's kitchen, like it's a cooking show.  But they're all...  You really watch those?  Oh, yeah.  I watch maybe for a minute.  No, I'll watch for a minute if they did a good job putting one together.  I love the train wrecks.  I like the ones that they're smart enough where you just think you're watching a commercial,  like a one-minute commercial, and it takes you five to seven minutes to realize, wait a  minute, this is going to be like just nonstop for the next 20 or 30 minutes. 
[00:10:00]  The music ones are fun, too.  I love these songs of the 70s.  And then they'll play like this clip, the same five songs over and over with video from  the same five bands doing those songs, and they can't even get them singing the song.  So they'll play the song in the background, show the band, and the guy's lips aren't moving  to it because they couldn't even sync it up.  They got like BTO doing some B-side song.  Completely ignoring the fact that everyone has iPods and can download this stuff themselves. 
[00:10:30]  Who's going to go out of their way to buy these CDs from a dumb show in this day and age?  The best part of this infomercial, my girlfriend and I watched it.  We couldn't stop.  I was just rewinding.  To the same thing.  And it was, I forget what it was called, but it was just about making a guy's package  large.  It was so stupid.  But it was like they were trying to do this random interview in the street thing, and  yet every person they talked to, they're like, hi, have you heard of this?  And the guy would go, yes, I have. 
[00:11:00]  Do you know anyone who's using it?  As a matter of fact, I'm on it.  Oh.  It was so bad, like every guy just happened to be taking this product and a bunch of tripods  walking around Los Angeles.  I would love to get that audio.  That would be funny.  It was wonderful.  It was so phony.  It was terrible.  Yeah, they don't have to be real.  It says it's an infomercial.  Well, we got this fine clip.  No, my brother, you've got to buy your own.  That was a classic.  That, I think, was the first real catchphrase type infomercial. 
[00:11:30]  Or was it even an infomercial?  It was just a commercial.  It was some kind of urban hits, you know?  Yeah, it was a bunch of people dancing in somebody's living room.  And he's like, wow, this is a great album.  Great album.  You mind if I borrow it?  And the guy goes, no, my brother, and takes it away from him.  You've got to buy your own.  No, my brother, man.  Mm-hmm.  Brother, man.  All right, we got that going on.  We got the stupid news.  They're rerunning that piece. 
[00:12:00]  We were making fun of this piece.  The local news, because, of course, the Super Bowl right around the corner now, two days  away.  They're doing a whole piece down here in New York.  What kind of clam chowder do you like better, Manhattan or New England?  Well, that makes sense, because the Patriots are from New England, and the Giants are from  New Jersey.  So they sent this report.  Why Manhattan clam chowder?  What about Jersey clam chowder?  They sent this reporter out, and they're just asking what you like better, and it's like 
[00:12:30]  a four- or five-minute piece.  It was god-awful, and they're rerunning it.  I guess they're going to rerun it every hour now.  So you just don't understand.  It culminates at the end of the piece with her mixing together Manhattan and New England  clam chowder.  Yeah.  And then eating it.  What happens?  I don't know.  Don't spoil it.  I want to see it.  I won't.  I won't.  It's like Lost.  Hey, speaking of the Super Bowl, we got the top five worst Super Bowl songs of all.  Of all time.  That's fantastic.  Some of these are.  We've been playing some bad ones, but these. 
[00:13:00]  There's one the Rams did called Ramming It.  Ramming It, huh?  I don't even know if we're allowed to play it on the radio.  I know they're talking about football, but whoa.  Of course they are.  Why would they sign off on this one?  They're ramming it.  You've got these big-time athletes bragging that they ram it.  Yeah.  Talking about how they ram it.  Nice.  By the way, let it be known that the Super Bowl is not even going to be close.  It's all cute that it's been hyped up for the last two weeks. 
[00:13:30]  The Patriots are going to destroy the Giants.  Eli Manning is going to get on that field in Arizona, and he's going to S his pants.  He seems pretty confident in his interviews.  Well, that just shows that he's hiding a lot of fear inside.  Yeah.  I just think it's so different when you're playing the Super Bowl than any other game, obviously.  He's going to walk out onto that field and realize this is completely foreign to him,  and he's just going to lose his mind.  Fans predicted, what, three interceptions?  I don't think it's going to be close whatsoever. 
[00:14:00]  No?  I think Eli had a great playoff, but I think it's not even going to be close.  You know what really gets people going?  First play.  Let's say the Giants win the coin toss.  Yeah.  They have the ball, and the first play out, interception, huge run for the Patriots for a touchdown.  And that'll set him up for the big win. 
[00:14:30]  That'll be like, you'll just sit there and go like, all right, let's turn this off.  Just turn this off.  No one's interested anymore.  You guys are right.  Dallas, again, different team, but Dallas, Buffalo in 93.  Dallas started off at a 7-0 deficit, and they won 52-17.  I mean, the score first doesn't mean anything.  I know, but it's how you do it.  If it's really an embarrassing, like if he gets ridiculously sacked the first play, you  just kind of look and go, oh, boy, oh, boy. 
[00:15:00]  Didn't they see that coming?  Brady's done, what, three Super Bowls now, right?  Oh, he can walk out there and notice everything.  It's got to be nerve-wracking, but when you're doing it for the first time, when Eli Manning  walks out onto that field and realizes there's billions of people watching, he's going to  S his pants.  And they're watching you.  Yeah.  For the most part, all eyes on you.  Right, which is just completely nerve-wracking, even if you've been there a few times.  But for the first time, and everything is a little too shiny, and there's way more cameras 
[00:15:30]  there, and the whole stadium is just glistening.  Sparkling.  They got blow-up stuff all over the place.  Huge logos on the field.  Yeah, it doesn't even look like a real football game.  No.  It looks like a futuristic game.  Movie set.  Played in a futuristic stadium.  It's going to be so foreign to him that I'm telling you, it's not even going to be  close.  Not even going to be close.  I don't know.  The Giants seem to have won a couple of very tough games on the road. 
[00:16:00]  In Texas, not easy to win in the playoffs, unless, of course, you're playing a team that  can't tackle.  And then in Green Bay, which is much more impressive, because they actually played like  men and still lost.  I don't know.  I think you're wrong.  I think the Giants are going to play really well.  You think they're going to win?  Yeah, I hate them, but I want them to win.  Why do you want the Giants to win?  I don't want the Patriot fans to have that joy.  That's all it is.  Why?  I don't like it.  I don't want them to be so happy.  You know something?  But you love the Boston Stouts when it comes to your comedy.  I love Boston.  Why don't you give them a break? 
[00:16:30]  Give them one little break.  One break?  They got the goddamn socks break.  Give them one break.  They come to your shows, Jimmy.  They're faithful to you and your comedy.  And I love them.  And I'm happy that their team is doing so well.  And I was happy when they won the Super Bowl.  But enough is enough.  I hate the Giants.  Always have hated the Giants.  Me too.  I mean, I'm not trying to jump on a bandwagon here.  I am a Jets fan, which makes it a little weird.  But we spent some time up there.  And I just hate the Giants.  And I'm one of these New York guys where when my New York team is out,  I don't jump on the other New York team.  I just can't do it.  You don't have state pride. 
[00:17:00]  Have some pride.  I would never root for the Rangers.  Never.  That's what I...  Because I like hockey way more than football.  I like hockey way more than baseball.  And I can't imagine, like, I'm a huge Islander fan.  I know.  Start laughing.  And, all right, so the Islanders get knocked out again.  And then I'm supposed to jump and start rooting for the Rangers?  That's insane to me.  You're not supposed to root.  Here's the ground rule here.  And I don't care because I'm from New York.  I'm supposed to root for the Giants.  F the Giants.  You're not supposed to root for them like they're the team you've been rooting for your whole life 
[00:17:30]  and be one of those fans.  Those are the fair weather fans.  But, given the choice, you've got to go with your home state team above, especially a state  that is just, with the whole Red Sox-Yankee thing, I can't even imagine rooting for the Patriots.  Sorry.  Can't even imagine.  I would root for any other team but the Patriots, even if the Giants weren't in there. 
[00:18:00]  See, I would root for the Patriots over a team I hate because I never want to see a team that beat my team win.  I want them to suffer as I have suffered.  Oh, man.  Well, you hate the Cowboys, so you would like the Patriots over the Cowboys.  No, I love the Cowboys, of course.  I just don't like when they can't play, they don't tackle.  But in this weird case, I just don't want to see a 19-0 season.  If it wasn't for that, I'd probably be rooting for New England to humiliate the Giants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Humiliate them.  I just don't want Boston fans smiling like that.  Oh, I'm fine with that. 
[00:18:30]  It's all good in my – see, this guy doesn't know the show anymore.  Ryan in Iowa, what's up?  Hey, what's up, OB?  I'm putting all my money on the Giants.  Thanks for the vote of confidence.  Winger hunger.  Well, you know, I've been rooting for the Pats very early this year, very early.  When I knew the Jets just, you know, socked, I started rooting for the Pats.  Every week I was saying, go, Pats, go.  You know that.  Yeah.  They kind of messed up my sports curse. 
[00:19:00]  They've been winning like crazy.  Uh, Joanne, Jersey, what's up?  Hi, uh, Jimmy.  Good morning.  Anthony and Opie.  Hello.  Yeah.  Um, I don't understand what the Giants ever did with you guys.  Huh?  I don't like the Giants.  What can I tell you?  Big blue.  Big blue blows.  And to give them just a tiny bit of credit for how far they've come.  I mean, come on.  Just a little, in your heart, you know, they.  Well, you gotta give them a little bit of credit there, OB.  They had a great second half of the season.  Eli Manning, I think, was the best quarterback in the playoffs, I believe, as far as stats go. 
[00:19:30]  I understand all that.  He came, you know, he grew up and became a big boy.  I'm a big kid now.  He's a big boy now.  But you know what?  He's going to S his pants Sunday.  He's going to lose his mind.  He's going to lose his mind when he hits that field.  When we come back, we're going to start with the Super Bowl songs.  Some of the most horrific Super Bowl songs ever done.  So bad.  I haven't heard half of these. 
[00:20:00]  I don't know how you don't hear a gunshot from the sound engineer room.  Right.  A muffled gunshot.  Well, they threw Super Bowl shuffle into this list.  We don't have to play that.  No.  I don't know that song.  It's classic.  But all these other songs were trying to become the next Super Bowl shuffle.  And as much as Super Bowl shuffle is kind of dated now and all that, when that song came out, a lot of people were digging it.  It was very popular.  Yeah.  I don't know if a lot of people liked it because it was kind of goofy.  And if you watched the video, the chills it gave you. 
[00:20:30]  Sure.  Well, the Bengals tried to come up with their own Super Bowl shuffle.  So did the Dolphins, the 49ers, the Raiders.  And, of course, the big highlight today, the Rams singing, Ramming It.  Ramming It.  All right.  All right.  We're going to go to break with this little piece that Tim put together yesterday.  Our pal, Bob Kelly, who's up in Boston for the Super Bowl.  He's playing the Comedy Connection in Fennell Hall tonight and tomorrow night.  Mm-hmm.  He was just telling us how much he loves Tom Brady. 
[00:21:00]  Listen to this.  He certainly does.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Baby, it's a dream come true.  You have a crush on a man?  Yes.  Who do you got a crush on?  I have a huge man crush on Tom Brady.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have sex with Tom Brady, but I would date him.  Really?  Yeah.  I'd like going to date.  Why do you have a crush on Tom Brady?  He's hot.  Brady has a perfect little bum chin. 
[00:21:30]  His eyebrows are nice and neat.  His hair is nice.  He's really looked into this.  This isn't even a bit.  His torso is, like, even with his legs.  His hands aren't mushed up.  They're nice, nice hands.  Wow.  You ever see him walk out?  Like, watch him after.  Watch any quarterback on the post-game interviews.  They're sweating still, and they just look grimy.  They got some T-shirt on.  Brady comes out looking like a supermodel, and he changes it every week.  One week, he's kind of rough with a little scally cap on. 
[00:22:00]  The next week, he'll come out with a suit with the napkin coming out of the pocket.  Then they'll switch it up and just wear a black raincoat to look like New York sleek.  He's not even hot.  He's perfect.  Tom Brady is perfect.  I met him, and my knees got weak.  They took us into the locker room, and it was...  Oh, did you see stuff there?  Just naked football players.  You were in heaven.  He walked out.  He was in a double-breasted gray suit with the white napkin coming out of the pocket. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, a picture right there.  Oh, God.  I was just staring at him.  I couldn't stop staring.  You know this is not normal, right?  Oh, it's not normal at all.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Black History Month has begun.  I dropped the voice down a little bit.  Oh, sorry.  That would be a stereotype.  I apologize to my black brother man out there.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  You think we could talk black?  If we had to?  Stick him up.  Jim is only joking.  Oh, you just got to have a little soul in your voice.  That's right.  Let me say hi to Josh in Buffalo, listening on the edge.  Josh, what's up?  What's up, man? 
[00:23:30]  Hey, Josh.  Hey, you being a Jets fan and rooting for the Pats, that's kind of sacrilegious on both.  It's kind of effed up.  I got to be honest with you.  I know that.  My brother Scott, who lives out there in South Hold, is not happy that I'm going with the Pats  because he truly believes the Pats are the asterisk team.  You know, the papers every day here as they're doing their Super Bowl coverage has to show  the asterisk in every Pats story.  But then my brother Darren, he went to Fredonia the same time I think Anthony's sister went 
[00:24:00]  to Fredonia, by the way.  Little Dawney.  We had a little connection back then.  I think I truly believe my brother and your sister hooked up back in the day, but they  were both too drunk to know that they hooked up.  I don't know.  I'm convinced of it.  I really am.  Something went on between my brother and your sister way back in the day when they were  both at Fredonia.  She never fessed up to it.  No, she wouldn't fess up because they wouldn't know.  It was just one of those like, you know.  I think my sister was a blackout and have sex kind of a gal. 
[00:24:30]  I don't remember that.  All right.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  I was just trying to have fun.  Geez.  My brother was a blackout type of guy.  I have to deal with the fact that she had sex with Adam Ferrara.  Please.  All right.  Let me just wrap my mind around that one.  All right.  Well, anyway, my brother Darren, he's a huge Jets fan, but a bigger Bills fan from his time  in Western New York.  Hello, Bills. 
[00:25:00]  And then you got me.  I grew up loving the Jets.  Then I spent well over 10 years in Western New York, so I love the Bills.  I take a peek every year.  I was up there for three out of the four Super Bowls, and we spent time in Boston, so I like  the Pats, too.  Have those Super Bowls go, by the way.  Pretty bad, yeah.  Yeah.  So I like my three favorite teams in football.  I swear to God, if you listen to the show, if you have listened to the show over the years, 
[00:25:30]  it's the Jets, it's the Bills, and it's the Pats.  Those are my three favorite football teams, and I know that's completely insane.  I know that.  Yeah, it is.  It's absolute insanity, man.  I mean, it's like the Islanders and the Rangers being in the same division.  I mean, that's understandable.  I mean, scratch the fact that the New York teams, you know, if it's the Islanders and  the Flyers, you're obviously going to hate the Flyers.  Well, to tell you the truth, this is where it gets weird in hockey.  Before I start rooting for the Rangers, I would root for the Flyers.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Why is that? 
[00:26:00]  I hate the Rangers.  Well, what exactly do you hate about them, though?  I'm an Islander fan.  They're pompous.  Ranger fans are pompous.  And Ope's got a Philly tie-in now.  They go to Madison Square Garden, and they watch, you know, hockey games in suits.  They're just pompous Wall Street dudes.  No, I don't get to see too many Rangers games.  Well, I'm a Rangers fan, obviously.  I don't get to see too many games, but when I go to the ones in Buffalo, I'm sitting there  front row, Rangers jersey, full decked out, loudest person that can be in the arena. 
[00:26:30]  Ready for this?  I liked the Sabres, too.  I liked the Sabres way before I liked the Rangers.  Way before I would like the Rangers.  All right, Josh.  Yeah, the thing is, I can see your point, because I would never root for the Red Sox.  Ever.  No matter who the hell they were playing.  Al-Qaeda could put a team together, and I'd be like, go Al-Qaeda.  That'd be a little rough, though.  Against the Sox?  Yeah, that'd be a little rough. 
[00:27:00]  Absolutely, I would root for the Al-Qaeda team first.  Would you?  Yeah.  It's not even, I don't even have to think about it.  That's how much I would never, ever root for the Red Sox.  And that's how you feel.  Yeah, I don't feel like I'm in a tough position.  I've never liked the Giants whatsoever.  Never.  And I don't like fair weather fans.  I don't like fans that jump from one New York team to the other just because they live in New York.  I don't like that.  I don't respect that. 
[00:27:30]  I wouldn't jump.  It's not like a jump thing.  Well, I'm not talking about you.  There are guys out there that are huge Jets fans.  That's ridiculous.  And they want the Giants to win.  And I'm not saying you should jump in and root for the Pats like you're excited they're going to win.  But you should probably maybe just kind of be maybe neutral.  But all of a sudden they become hardcore Giants fans.  Not hardcore.  But I think you can sit there and want the Giants to win, even if you're a Jets fan.  I think it's the fair weather fans for the simple fact that they hate the Patriots.  And me, for the thing is, it's just I hate the New England sports dominance this year. 
[00:28:00]  You know, the baseball, football, basketball.  Thank God.  Who cares about soccer?  You know, after the Pats win the Super Bowl, then all eyes are on the Celtics.  They're having a fine year, too, man.  They can win the Triple Crown this year.  The Triple Crown, my friend.  And I'll even say this because I was a sport.  I mean, I still like sports, but it would really affect my life.  Fairweather fan.  Yes.  Yes.  You're into that.  Now I am.  I'm like, I'm almost like, yes, I am a Fairweather fan. 
[00:28:30]  And you know what?  Drop dead.  I am a Fairweather.  When's the last time one of the Cowboys showed up to one of my gigs?  Or when's the last time they took off to watch me do anything?  Or one of the Yankees showed up when I needed a few bucks.  They don't.  Yes, I'm a Fairweather fan now.  They're doing good.  I'm interested.  If they're not, they can fall into a ditch.  I don't bleed Dallas stars.  I bleed giant blue.  I wish you were right now.  Well, we've said this off and on for a while now. 
[00:29:00]  The fans take it way more serious than the actual players in the end as far as rooting  for the hometown team.  You know, the players are rooting for the hometown team because that's who they're playing for  right now.  But you got guys that'll root for the Pats until they're dead.  But these guys who take pride...  I don't even mind a fan who's that hardcore.  Like, I really don't.  Like, if a guy just loves his team, it's cool.  I hate the way they think, though, that that makes them somehow better on any level at anything. 
[00:29:30]  Like, dude, I'm hardcore.  Yeah, really?  Well, then why don't you paint your face and stay on the tracks?  I'm not interested.  I don't care how hardcore a fan you are of a stupid bunch of men who throw a ball around  Yeah, the real hardcore fans that just wear all the jerseys and have their houses nothing  but decorated with the team.  And they do have this attitude like they have more of a right to be a fan than anyone else  does.  And if you even talk about being a fan, they jump on you about, yeah, you're not a come 
[00:30:00]  on, come on.  And then if they blurt out stats that you don't know, they try to catch you, trip you up.  But that's their one source of pride is that they're not a fair weather fan.  And do you mean, like, when that team wasn't scoring as many points, you still sat there  like an idiot with a beer in your hand and a flag and watched them?  You're better than me.  Good for you.  Good for you.  All right, let's say hi to Matthew in Virginia. 
[00:30:30]  Matthew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm kind of with Jimmy here.  I'm kind of excited to see the Pats win just because it'll shut up the stupid 1971 Dolphins  or whatever in their perfect season.  But at the same time, I kind of want to see them lose so that all their hopes and dreams  kind of get slushed down.  Dude, I can tell you, I haven't followed sports as closely in the last few years, just the  nature of doing gigs and stuff, whatever.  And I watched that Dallas playoff game this year, and it's amazing the rage that team 
[00:31:00]  playing badly can...  I really would drop dead eventually if I continued to watch it.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't do it anymore.  Too much stress.  I will never be able to comfortably watch a team lose like that.  I just can't handle it.  I can't do it.  Wow.  Let's go to Tom in Boston.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, Ope, what's up?  You love those three teams you love, right?  Yeah.  It's the AFC East minus Miami.  I know.  I'm going to acknowledge it. 
[00:31:30]  It's really stupid.  How do you love teams in the same division?  And then the Bills play the Jets, and it's like, you know, I win.  No matter what.  I kind of win.  You're a winner today.  You know what?  I hate the NFC in general, though.  I freaking hate the NFC.  You're a Jet fan, though.  I'm not a big NFC fan.  I can't think of one NFC team I root for, I guess.  No.  You can't have one, bro.  I have one NFC team.  It's the Bucs.  I love the Buccaneers.  You like the Buccaneers? 
[00:32:00]  Very cool.  See, like the Jet fans, like...  I don't understand hardcore Jet fans.  I mean, you're more dedicated than I've ever been.  But it's almost like the team has been so disgustingly handled for so many years,  and they refuse to get a stadium.  They refuse to do so much.  If people just stopped going, they would eventually do something.  But people are like, dude, I ain't fair weather.  Okay, fine.  Then you sit there.  It's 10 degrees out.  You have your little beverage while they're being slaughtered 38-2.  Not even on a safety because the guy tripped while he was walking back at halftime with the football. 
[00:32:30]  You convince yourself that you're helping the team.  I love when you go see a Jets game or whatever, and the Jets are like 3-13,  and you decide to leave in the fourth quarter because you want to beat the traffic.  You're not really seeing anything special at this point.  And everyone boos you as you're leaving the stadium.  Are you leaving?  Fair weather fan.  Yeah, whatever.  You get stuck in two hours of traffic because you needed to see the last play of a 3-13 team.  Screw Fair weather. 
[00:33:00]  Whatever.  I'm a bright, sunny day fan.  Right.  Not even fair.  What's the weather, Al?  It's fair.  No, bright, sunshiny day fan.  The second it even looks a little cloudy out, I'm not a fan.  I'm away.  The minute they lose, I don't look.  I'm not that bad.  Here we go.  We got to save ramming it for a little later, but we're playing terrible NFL rap songs.  Okay.  The first one is from the Bengals.  They really thought they had a hit on their hands when they came up with Fear the Tigers. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, I thought you meant the Bengals hit it.  Listen to this.  Cincinnati, are you ready?  Yeah.  Welcome to Paul Brown Stadium.  And let's give a warm welcome to Marvin Lewis and the Cincinnati Bengals.  Fear the Tigers.  Fear the Tigers.  Because we're the Tigers.  Crank it up.  We're ready to rumble.  Crank it up, boo.  Because we're king of the jungle. 
[00:34:00]  Crank it up, boo.  Fear the Tigers.  Fear the Tigers.  Because we're the Tigers.  Crank it up, boo.  We're the king of the jungle.  The king of the jungle.  And we're ready to rumble.  Where's the jungle?  I'm not Paul Wall, but I'm real dirty.  Like the stuff, and you know I got a bad girlie.  At home, and she's cooking on some leg bones.  On the sideline, talking on the telephone.  Made two adjustments, and I was gone.  Now I'm back on the field to seal the deal.  Flew the backfield up with intent to kill.  Now that's how I'm living, because I'm way too real. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know what he was going for there.  He was on the phone, and something about a bone.  While his wife's cooking at home.  This is not one of the worst Super Bowl songs ever, though.  This is just like a mediocre rap song.  They could have picked a lot worse one than this.  This is awful.  I don't like any sports song.  Biggest dance in the jungle.  When we come through, we gon' shake, rattle, and rumble.  Rumble like some thunder in the middle of the summer.  Rolling over players like a Hummer and a Honda. 
[00:35:00]  On them 84s, oh yeah, I'm the man.  When I hit the field, you understand what I'm saying.  The feel is how you see me when I'm showing my mean mug.  Getting the icing on the cake when you see the scoreboard.  Man!  Hooray!  That's a West Coast sound to it.  That reminds me of old Snoop.  But that's not a good song, but that's not as bad as the Patriots song we're listening to this year.  Well, wait till you hear Ramit.  Wait till you hear Ramit.  We probably should have went right to Ramit.  Big debate last night.  You had Hillary and Obama going at it, and it was pretty much a draw, they're saying. 
[00:35:30]  No real clear winner.  I think they're trying to...  They both held their own.  I think the fact of the matter is they're both the frontrunners here, you know, and neither wants to really trip up.  So they're not really taking any chances right now until a Super Tuesday.  You know, they're really pummeling the airwaves with ads.  Right.  But as far as debate goes, none of them was going to say anything that was really going to be earth-shattering 
[00:36:00]  because they don't want to fall into a trap and say something stupid.  Wouldn't you love one of them one day, I mean any candidate, to screw up and go, you know what, I did say that, that was stupid, that was wrong, what I should have said.  Why would none of them...  Everyone has to be perfect.  Yeah, when they criticize, like, didn't you say two years ago that you supported this?  And then the guy go, yeah, I did.  You know something?  I thought it over and realized I was wrong on that one.  Did a little research or whatever. 
[00:36:30]  But then they go, oh, wrong!  That's the guy's supposed to be infallible?  Yeah, how about some real moments?  I'd rather have somebody, yeah, fess up, make a mistake and fess up to it, than try so hard to not make a mistake.  You're going to make mistakes.  All right, I got something really fast for you guys.  So the debate was pretty much a wash last night, okay?  Anyway, they polled some people and asked who won the debate.  And I think you two can figure out what this person will say just by their makeup here. 
[00:37:00]  Okay.  All right?  Let's try this.  You got Rita Normandu.  She's 61, and she's an actress.  Uh-huh.  I think that she's going to say it was close, but I thought Hillary made most of the major points, and do you have any work for me?  Does anybody need any to pen undergarments sold on television?  Or dent you cream?  I think it's probably, well, what she does is known to be a little liberal. 
[00:37:30]  Very.  But the age, she's probably got some ingrained things in her head that she can't get out.  All right.  I'll say Obama, though.  Ooh, Jimmy is right.  One for Jimmy.  Oh, damn.  One for Jimmy.  All right.  How about Alexander Otero, 42.  He's a tow truck driver in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Oh, boy. 
[00:38:00]  Okay.  Hillary.  A 42-year-old truck driver in Williamsburg?  Tow truck driver in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Okay.  I'm guessing he's black.  I could be wrong.  I'm saying I'm guessing he's black and that he said something along the lines of boo for the Jews, and he went for Obama.  Another point for Jimmy.  Damn.  Jimmy's got this so far.  But I will say the way you set it up, I kind of, you know.  Oh, really?  I thought he was Irish.  All right.  I'll try to be.  Well, no, Williamsburg.  They just.  Oh, no.  Crown Heights is where I'm thinking of. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Oh, wow.  You made a mistake and it paid off.  I was wrong.  How about Jennifer Cho, 36, stay-at-home mom, Jackson Heights, Queens.  Age?  36.  Hillary.  Um, I don't know.  Will she go for a woman or she's Asian?  Will she go for a minority?  Uh, I'm going to say she went for a.  Blacks and Asians don't normally get along with each other.  That's a damn good point.  But the paper would probably want to have some diversity of opinion because they think 
[00:39:00]  that that's interesting.  Oh, that's true, true.  Well, they may be saying, ah, I'm going to say she went with Obama.  I'm going to say she, uh, that they wanted to show a woman voting for Obama so it wasn't  too obvious.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Well, she don't want Hillary.  Anthony got one there.  Oh, yay.  Uh, how about Ilana Segal, S-I-G-A-L-L, however you would say that, 41.  She's a professor at Columbia University.  I'm just laughing.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Right there.  Obama.  Karl Marx. 
[00:39:30]  41.  Professor at Columbia University.  Obama.  Obama.  Obama.  And again, now it's just a matter of like when you don't know the answer on a test,  that you start like just going back and forth.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Five in a row.  Right.  A pattern.  Yeah.  I'm going to say that a very liberal professor probably went with, uh, God almighty, would  she want the black?  Hillary.  I got to say Hillary.  Jimmy's right again.  Damn, wow.  Jimmy only has one wrong.  And, uh, Jeff Kaufman.  He's 52 and he's a high school teacher in Queens. 
[00:40:00]  You do?  Kaufman.  Hmm.  Probably.  Uh, Hillary.  Um, I'm going to say that he's 52.  As liberal as he may be, he feels more comfortable with the man.  So he went with Brock.  You're both right.  He thinks it was a tie.  Oh.  A high school teacher.  A high school teacher thinks it was a tie.  Hedging that bet.  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's what you expect from a high school teacher.  What a weasel with no opinion.  Right.  Yeah, right.  Come on.  What, do you want to work for one of them? 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Uh, we're going to do some more of these terrible NFL rap songs after the break.  Get into some other things.  Who's coming in today?  We got Russell Peters.  Uh, he bailed.  Okay.  He's a very funny comedian.  Well, he's getting ready for his big show tonight, I guess.  We had him on yesterday, but we got so busy later on on the Opie and Anthony show that  we didn't get to talk to him as much as we would have liked.  So we invited him back, but he-  But since canceled.  To his credit, with everything that was going on in there and his limited mic time that he  had, everything he said was funny as hell. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Uh, I was listening to a little bit of the replay on the way in this morning and wow,  he had some great lines.  He'll be back.  I mean, he's a guy I know well.  He's a very funny comic.  Yeah.  And he's doing major shows tonight.  Yeah.  A major show tonight in here in the Paramount Theater, whatever it is.  All right.  We got Louis C.K. coming in as well.  And, uh, speaking of yesterday, we did Cherry Darts and that's all we could say on this side  of the show.  Yeah.  But the website that is named after our show has some fine, fine pictures. 
[00:41:30]  Some fine, fine pictures.  Wow.  Holy mother of God.  Which one is that?  Who do you think?  I don't know.  There's a couple of them.  Like I said, the website has some fine pictures.  Say something.  That's Ohio, he said.  Wow.  That's Ohio.  Yeah.  There was a girl from Ohio.  There was two sisters from Ohio.  That's amazing.  And there was a hiney from, I think, Long Island.  And I wanted to say, it was the type of thing, like when I saw this girl. 
[00:42:00]  Where's that one?  Jen, I think her name was?  Yeah.  When I saw her ass, I felt the way like religious people feel when they have some sort of, like  when the Virgin Mary shows up on bread.  It was just.  Look.  Look at that.  Uh, like I said, we got some fine pictures.  God almighty.  Oh, Jesus.  On the website that is named after this radio show.  Wow.  Right, well.  I can't believe what actually comes out of it.  We have some very fine pictures. 
[00:42:30]  Whether it's going into a cup or.  That's right on a boy's chest.  Um, wow.  Amazing.  Oh!  Well, and then.  Yeah, thanks, hero.  And now we got the goof factor.  But it's all fun in the end.  So, check out the pictures for yourself.  Damn, Ohio looked good.  Uh, is that legal?  Are these pictures legal?  Show me both Ohio's, the sisters.  People, um.  Some people on PalTalk yesterday,  because we had a crap load of people on PalTalk during that event. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  They actually didn't think it was real.  Really?  Because whenever you go and you see something so cool on there,  you think it's a tape or a porn movie or just something.  But other people were telling them,  no, this is absolutely real.  Damn.  So, there you go.  Check it out for yourself.  It's like a snare drum.  How sexy is that?  Jesus.  All right, wow.  I was, all I can say is this,  while I was watching this event,  all I was doing was fiddling and pinching. 
[00:43:30]  Fiddling and pinching.  Disgraceful.  And there you go.  Yeah, I gotta admit,  I do believe I got up at one point,  and I had to sit back down.  Oh, really?  Out of embarrassment.  Yeah.  Anthony was kind of losing his mind yesterday.  Over, over, over, over that.  Over that.  Over that.  She's standing there with that ass over that.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  We had a bunch of naked girls.  All I'm gonna say is this,  one, and they would do something and then line up. 
[00:44:00]  It was very great.  And there was one who was a big girl.  If you've ever seen Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.  Think wafer and bucket.  But the confidence she had was pretty amazing.  I think she was great.  Her name was Chris.  Yeah.  It was so funny to watch.  She was blocking Anthony's view of what could be the greatest ass of the millennium.  I mean, I'm including the 1970s.  Yeah, of course.  And he goes, could you switch with her?  In the middle of the show, I just stopped everything and went,  you, could you just move and switch places? 
[00:44:30]  Because I couldn't, I didn't, you couldn't see anything behind that girl.  That girl, because she was a little big.  He asked the big girl to move so he could look at the ass of a small girl.  Oh, God, is that hot.  They're all so naughty.  By the way, people are going to the other websites.  Just staring at pictures.  It's the website named after this radio show.  The show, what's wrong with you?  Y'all at Opie, he's trying to clarify.  It's the name, not Opie.  All right, with that.  Oh, my God.  With that, we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there. 
[00:45:00]  Get it?  It's black history, man.  Right.  This is what we did.  Go check it out, the Opie and Anthony show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Don't forget about onaradio.com.  And don't forget about our website that we can't promote.  That's where the good stuff is, people.  You know what I mean?  There's a reason why we can't promote it. 
[00:45:30]  Uh, what else is going on?  Yeah, this kind of creeped me out today.  Scientists say all blue-eyed people are related.  What?  I actually read that at 4.15 this morning.  Because I wake up, my BlackBerry goes off.  Yes.  And then I check my mail real fast because Travis sends a little news thing.  And I'm reading the news about how all blue-eyed people are related.  And then I kind of rolled over and looked at my fiancée. 
[00:46:00]  Who has fine blue eyes.  And I'm like, oh my God, this is creepy.  Related, uh...  How?  I don't know.  Is it, uh...  That would take some reading.  Probably, uh, like, hundreds of thousands of years ago.  Dan, what do you know on this one?  I think it's basically that there was one dude with blue eyes.  Like, it started it all.  Some sort of mutation.  A devil.  Some type of devil.  Really?  Yeah, they're tracing it back to one guy with blue eyes.  One guy. 
[00:46:30]  It's, uh, got to be acknowledged, by the way, uh, Than is out of Afro Wars officially.  We're doing this Afro Wars with Rana Fez.  And Than can't really grow an Afro, so he's been growing this, uh, massive beard.  I mean, it got massive.  And he finally had it.  And he had a shave the other day.  And he's been coming in with different, like, uh, facial hairstyles.  Yesterday he came in looking exactly like Steve.  Our own Steve.  And today he's got the creepy mustache on.  Do we have photos with you every day like this?  Oh, yeah.  We're gonna put up, we'll put up, uh, the photos on onaradio.com today. 
[00:47:00]  Sure.  Can we do the whole thing with the big beard and then, uh, you know, the goatee and now  we got the mustache?  The, the one I took of myself in my bathroom last night, just, uh, Travis nailed it.  It's a smoking gun pedo mug shot.  Yeah.  It is the worst picture of fan you ever want to see.  It's definitely a, uh, uh, watch out for this guy in your neighborhood picture.  With that mustache right now, you look like Jeffrey Jones.  He's the, uh, principal in Ferris Bueller's. 
[00:47:30]  Yes.  Oh, wow.  That's the mustache.  Just a creep.  Bueller.  Look at the picture he took last night.  We'll have all these pictures up on onaradio.com as part of Stephen S. from Bayshore's rundown.  Wait, what did you say about blue-eyed?  Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't hear that, but all back to one person?  One guy started with blue eyes?  How does that work?  What is that?  Someone explain the universe to me.  You're not talking about the Nation of Islam thing about how white people were created.  Oh, boy.  Maybe.  Okay.  Dr. Jakob?  Who knows? 
[00:48:00]  So that's going on.  Maybe.  Created white people?  That's why we're evil?  Yeah, that's what the nation believes.  Oh, that's good.  That's logical.  Also, the LAPD defends huge police presence that took Brittany to the hospital.  Did you guys see that?  Motorcade?  She's just a kook.  Paparazzi following the ambulance.  She's a kook, but because she's famous, then she gets presidential attention and treatment.  Yeah.  Did you see how many...  Yeah, it was amazing.  The flashes that were going off, and they're following the ambulance. 
[00:48:30]  They talked to a few people.  They thought the president was in town.  Because it was that type of thing with the guys on the motorcycles and SUVs.  Yeah, it was a motorcade.  It was a motorcade, exactly.  And the police will probably defend it, saying that, look, I mean, people, the paparazzi  are driving like crazy to get photos.  It's endangering other people.  They have to start really arresting these guys, taking away lights.  They have to really start hurting these guys, because they're just driving like lunatics.  They're wrecking neighborhoods.  Yeah.  Speech.  Speech.  Speech. 
[00:49:00]  Sorry, I'm boring myself.  They're saying it's not preferential treatment.  It's protecting public safety.  They're eventually just going to have a tank for Britney Spears.  Just put her in a tank.  What are they protecting?  If Britney dies, and most likely she's going to do something stupid, and that's what's  going to end up happening, who gives a crap at the end?  So she contributed a couple of cool pop songs back in the day.  Yeah.  You hear about the laxatives she's taking?  No.  She's taking up to 10 laxatives a day. 
[00:49:30]  Trying to lose weight, or what is that about?  She's on like a Red Bull and laxatives diet.  Is that her defense against the paparazzi?  Just muck up the lens?  Do a headstand and spin quickly.  Show her about his boss.  This chick used to be an 11, and now you're finding out she's taking 10 laxatives a day.  She's on the Red Bull.  She's smoking cigarettes.  She's drinking all the Starbucks drinks.  She's going through Cinnamon Glade air freshener in the bathroom with a can a day.  The worst picture that actually almost made me feel bad for her is her sitting on the 
[00:50:00]  curb with her dog.  Why did you feel bad?  Because she's wearing a Judge Smails hat.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah.  And we never thought we'd see Britney Spears wearing a Judge Smails hat.  Yeah.  Kind of feel bad.  She is a kook.  They're saying she's going downhill fast.  There it is.  Look at her Judge Smails hat.  She is just not right.  It's amazing how, like, I don't know, like, we're saying, well, we're such voyeuristic 
[00:50:30]  people, and we are, and we are kind of pigs to look at this, but it's not like she's being  private about it.  I mean, this was one of the biggest singers in the last 25 years, and now she's just a  psychopath.  How do you not look?  Oh, it's a great story.  Because we don't know her, so it's great.  You want it to end in tragedy, too.  A lot of us out there are hoping it ends in a tragedy.  You know, if the story ends, well, wow, Britney got her act together, and she's going to put  out an album and go back on tour, I think there's going to be a big letdown by a lot 
[00:51:00]  of people.  Yeah.  For a lot of people.  We love tragedy.  As humans, we love tragedy.  We don't like to admit it, but we love it.  Yep.  You know, when you're in traffic and you know you're being delayed because there's a car  accident, you're not hoping for a little fender bender.  No, you won't.  You really aren't.  Carnage.  You're a little scared of luck sometimes, but you're looking because you just want to see something  horrific.  Yeah.  Deep down, you want to see something.  Do you know if she straightened up and did put out another, as long as she doesn't do 
[00:51:30]  anything beyond, like, this is all self-destructive crap.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Amy Winehouse.  People will watch this all day.  All you got to do is straighten up and come back, and people are like, oh, good, you're  back.  In Hollywood, you can do this stuff all day, and no one will ever hold it against you,  as long as you're not being a kid toucher or something.  I've always been a fan of celebrities that are self-destructive.  Always.  What is that about?  Are we all like that, or is it just not?  It can't just be me, but Kinison, Belushi, Chris Farley, Kurt Cobain. 
[00:52:00]  I love destructive entertainers.  I can't get enough of them.  It's the cliche thing to say, because it's been said so many times, but people really  do love the big build-up and then the big tear-down.  They love watching people become successful and then love watching them just self-destruct  and fall apart.  I think sometimes, and there's other times, like, I noticed that my idols are all screw-ups.  Ozzy is a disaster.  I mean, he's better now, but even in the rock and roll world, you look at Ozzy and they 
[00:52:30]  would go, ugh, that guy has a problem.  Yeah.  But what is that about?  Is it because their personality faults make them more creative in what they're doing?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Are you watching somebody?  You just feel like you're watching somebody, like, doing 100 miles an hour with no seatbelt  on, and there's something about that that's very intoxicating.  Not in a bad way, like you want to watch them fall, but you're just watching somebody  reckless.  I would rather see Sam Kinison than Jerry Seinfeld.  Sure.  You know, that's where I come from. 
[00:53:00]  You know?  I couldn't get enough of Sam Kinison.  Jerry Seinfeld, yeah, he's great, but whatever.  But he's healthy.  He never did anything for me.  Too healthy.  As far as, like, enjoying his comedy.  Yeah, it was a great show.  He's a great show.  He's a great stand-up.  He retires with a quarter billion, marries a hot chick and has nice kids.  Who wants to live that life?  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  I just want to know if any of you guys know the whereabouts of Howard K. Stern, because  Brittany's recent plight sounds an awful lot like the last days of Anna Nicole. 
[00:53:30]  Well, she has her own Howard K. Stern, that Luft guy that is fighting for control of Brittany.  I mean, anyone else reading up on this stuff?  It's pretty interesting.  He's like, I guess Brittany signed some papers the last time she was in the nuthouse, and  I guess this guy Sam Luft, I think his name is, Lufty or whatever, has control over Brittany.  And the parents are out of their minds yelling and screaming at this guy, like, you're hurting  her even more.  But supposedly, he can make the medical decisions. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Just pull the plug.  I love you guys.  See you later.  All right.  So now it's going to have to go in front of a judge, because the parents are outraged.  They don't want this Lutfy, something like that, to be in control of her.  And it, oh, I just, my mind just went on.  No.  We'll commit you.  Oh, well.  What happened to me?  Sorry, Jimmy.  We were just talking about something.  I just lost my mind.  We were talking about Brittany.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She needs to be dragged away from, like, and not go back to, like, the Hollywood scene 
[00:54:30]  or anything.  She needs to go back to her country bumpkin upbringing.  Her mom wants to bring her back to Louisiana for a while.  But she's going to be in the nuthouse at least three days, and they're going to try for a  longer stay.  Yeah, she'll be in there longer.  They really tricked her, too.  It was, like, kind of an intervention, but they had this plan in place.  Yeah, the ambulance rolling up.  Yeah, the, what?  The NYPD.  The LAPD were calling her the package.  They had code words for her and everything. 
[00:55:00]  It's like, hey, why are they out there?  Oh, man.  And then he came in, and she did not go willingly.  No.  No.  Had to drag her crying.  All right, so that's going on as well.  And then you've got some 92-year-old legally blind golfer.  He gets a hole-in-one.  What?  Legally blind?  That's luck, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, thanks.  The first time in 20 years he actually hit it towards the hole.  He's been firing backwards towards the 18th from the beginning. 
[00:55:30]  So that's a big deal.  Another terrible NFL rap song.  This one is a Dolphins song called Can't Touch Us.  Can't Touch Us.  Instead of can't.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Blue 42.  Blue 42.  Yeah.  Sit.  Hut, hut, hut.  Can't Touch Us.  Can't Touch Us.  Can't Touch Us. 
[00:56:00]  Can't Touch Us.  My, my, my, my, Miami hits them so hard.  Makes them say, oh, my Lord, thank you for blessing me with all those Dolphins and all that  speed that's good.  And you know you're down with a Super Bowl team and a super hometown.  We're known as such.  This is a team you can't touch.  Told you, Buffalo.  Can't Touch Us.  Yeah.  That's how we're playing in, you know.  Can't Touch Us.  Look at that ball fly, man. 
[00:56:30]  Can't Touch Us.  Yo, let me bust these football lyrics.  Can't Touch Us.  West do kids and fans.  You got to like that.  Now you know you want to dance.  Don't move.  Out of your seat.  Watch the other team because they're going to get big things rolling.  Hold on.  Pull a little bit.  Let them know what's going on.  Chill.  Like that.  Push on, Miami.  Push them on back.  Let them know.  You're too much.  This team can't touch.  That's awful.  What a creepy white guy.  Yeah, that's awful. 
[00:57:00]  By the way, Stephen S. from Bayshore, he writes,  I enjoy nothing better than Elvis' slow slide into oblivion.  And I don't know why.  That was just really interesting to watch him slowly fade away.  Because Elvis was beautiful.  To watch Elvis laugh at himself on stage and become this disaster.  And women still wanted him.  There was a beauty in that.  Can we play laughing Elvis?  We haven't done that in a while.  If you can find out.  Chuckling.  A little chuckling Elvis.  He still had some kind of dignity though, man.  He was still a bad dude on stage.  He was a bad dude on stage, man.  I love watching Fed Elvis. 
[00:57:30]  I really do.  I love him.  Why though?  There was something.  To me, it was easy to be charismatic when he was young and beautiful.  I mean, in the 60s, who cared?  But in 1976, when he was bloated in a jumpsuit that he never...  He wore a cape.  The man wore a cape on stage and just threw little silk things at chicks and they went crazy.  And he was fat.  All he wanted to do was eat banana and peanut butter sandwiches and not go to the bathroom.  And I'm getting a little abuse from Scott M. from Hobhog. 
[00:58:00]  He goes, no, I'm not reading up on Brittany Ope.  I am because it's a train wreck.  I like reading about train wrecks.  It is really bad.  But she's in a bad way.  Now it's getting...  It's definitely teetering on kind of pathetic and sad.  Because I don't think it's at the point where she's thinking out, hey, this is great publicity for me.  This is a girl that's like really effed up now.  But it couldn't get sad enough for me.  No?  No, I'm serious.  You just want her dead? 
[00:58:30]  When I see the body bag, it's going to be sad for me because there's going to be no more to watch.  To watch.  Oh, yeah.  The decline.  Here's Laughing Elvis.  What do we know about this clip?  I think Stephen S. from Bayshore brought it to our attention.  But Elvis is singing one of his songs.  And I think some guy's toupee.  I don't know what made him laugh.  I know there's different laughing clips.  There's not only one.  There's many different clips of him from different shows laughing.  And Stephen S. would know.  I think it was Love Me Tender.  There's a scene where he talks to it like you're standing there and the world is bare or whatever it is. 
[00:59:00]  And when he would do that live, he was probably really high.  And he would laugh a lot, I think.  It's Are You Lonesome Tonight?  I'm sorry.  Are you lonesome tonight?  When he starts going, Are you lonesome tonight?  We might have to stop it because I think I'll remember.  I think there's a line in the song, and as he's doing the line, somebody in the audience's toupee got knocked off.  Oh, yeah, that was it.  Or got messed up a little bit.  And started laughing.  Maybe.  And Elvis saw it and then just lost it. 
[00:59:30]  Because he's laughed many times during this song.  To me, there was something very silly about what he was saying.  Yeah.  And he just always would laugh.  This is one of my favorite clips.  We haven't played this enough.  Laughing Elvis, everyone.  I do the chairs in your poilor, seem empty and bare.  Do you gaze at your bald head and wish you had hair?  Can you stop that?  Is that a line from the actual song? 
[01:00:00]  No.  Okay.  I didn't think so.  So he was just messing around.  That's what it was.  He saw a guy bald in the audience, I guess.  He would throw these weird lyrics out during this part.  Like, he's done it in a different show.  Just to keep it interesting for himself, probably, right?  And he would, I love the fact that half the time his audience would laugh at his awful jokes.  Yeah.  And Elvis would bomb in front of his own crowd all the time.  I want to introduce the band.  John, this is Charlie.  Because they probably weren't a, you know, they probably weren't a crowd that was into comedy. 
[01:00:30]  They just wanted to hear Elvis and didn't realize that the guy's actually funny, too, on top of it.  Dude, you want to watch your god, you want to watch this thing you idolized.  You don't want to see him fat laughing at himself on a pill haze.  All right.  Here we go.  So now I think that's what it was.  I think he was making up the lyrics, saw it like a bald guy and went with it.  And then he couldn't help himself.  Do you gaze at your bald head and wish you had hair?  A drop filled with pain. 
[01:01:00]  Shall I come back?  Tell me, dear, are you lost?  Oh, Lord, Lord.  I wonder how.  You know, someone said, the world's a stage.  He must play a part.  Listen to him laugh, man. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  And I had no cause to die.  Oh, my God. 
[01:02:00]  Sing it, baby.  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear, are you lost?  Is your heart filled with pain?  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear, are you lost? 
[01:02:30]  How great is that, man?  Steven S., he's giving us a little more info.  The guy lifted his toupee when Elvis mentioned bald head, and Elvis could not stop laughing.  Oh, okay.  And the best part, Steven S. continues, are the girls still going with the backup singing,  no matter how much Elvis falls apart?  Yeah, that is, people are saying, wow, what troopers the backup singer is.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what's great about that?  That is a genuine laugh. 
[01:03:00]  That cannot be a more genuine laugh.  It wasn't put on.  It wasn't something that they do, you know, they do in every city or something.  He's just laughing his ass off.  Laughing his fat hillbilly ass off.  You know what's cool about that?  He had fun right to the end.  Yep.  A lot of entertainers, they just don't have fun anymore.  Well, you can tell he had fun right up until just before the end.  I don't think sitting there on the bowl, he was having much fun.  I'm talking about his stage performance.  At least we're numb, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Let's say hi to Angie in Rochester.  We've got to say good afternoon to Rochester.  Hello.  We barely acknowledge Rochester, the home of Brother Louise.  What's up, Angie?  I have an idea for you guys.  Yes.  Okay, so you know how girls, we have to whip a dollar on Wednesdays, right?  Yeah.  Okay, what about the guys?  We need something true for us girls.  Oh, boy.  How about take it out Tuesday?  Wait, we've been through this.  Wait, you suggest what?  Take it out Tuesday.  And how would that work, Angie, from Rochester? 
[01:04:00]  Well,  Yuck, sane.  Hey, Black History Month, after the break, what are we doing?  Guys flash.  Girls flash during WOW.  It's great.  Guys flash on this day she wants to invent.  They go to jail.  Yeah.  That's just the way it works.  Yeah.  We can't be whipping things out.  We figured this whole thing out years ago.  Yeah.  See, we kept it legal with Whip It Out Wednesday.  And we kept it heterosexual with Whip It Out Wednesday. 
[01:04:30]  We don't want to be the show that promotes, you know, take it out Tuesday.  No.  Let man down do that or something.  Can I wish luck to our black friend, Wesley Snipes?  Yeah.  Good luck, Wesley.  I hope he beats the taxpaying rep.  I don't think he will.  I think he's in deep doo-doo.  I think you're right.  I think he's in deep doo-doo.  Black History Month, what are we doing?  We're going to, like, look at...  Black heroes.  Black heroes.  Sure.  Let's call it that.  We're going to look at our first black hero after the break as part of Black History Month. 
[01:05:00]  Right?  Okay.  We're involved with this.  That's cool.  That's very cool.  Also, something for you guys to do as we step aside for a second.  We're sending Sam and Big A to the NBC Knight Rider premiere.  It's a party at the Playboy Mansion.  And you can join them.  Really?  You don't have to hang out with them, but you can go with them, and then you can go your  separate ways.  Can you go into the grotto?  Imagine Big A in the grotto.  I want to go in the grotto and see what that skimmer picks up in the pool.  Why am I the only one in the grotto?  Where are the bunnies? 
[01:05:30]  We're sending Big A to the Playboy Mansion?  I'm going to take full credit for that one.  As soon as I heard about this promotion, I begged God to allow that to happen.  It's fantastic.  That mess.  Just seeing him at the Playboy Mansion.  Hey, hef.  In a big robe.  And they'll say that to him.  Hey, hef.  If you want to join the guys, you go to onaradio.com to register for the trip to the Playboy Mansion.  And don't forget to watch the Knight Rider movie event Sunday, February 17th on NBC. 
[01:06:00]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We lost Jimmy for a little while.  This is the craziest morning show in America.  Jimmy was there, but now he has to go somewhere else to do another morning show.  Really?  We're the only morning show that does other people's morning shows.  Yeah.  And not even like it's not a guest that has to go and do it. 
[01:06:30]  Jimmy's a member of this program.  Yeah.  It's one of the main players.  He's now not on our show anymore because he has to do another morning show for about 15 or 20 minutes.  He's doing some other show.  You're already doing two shows at the same time.  Yeah.  So we called Louis C.K. off the bench and he's now in the game.  I'm always ready.  It's Black History Month, by the way.  We're going to be celebrating.  We're going to be looking at some very important black people.  The history of blackness.  From the world of everything.  From the world of blackness. 
[01:07:00]  Gotcha.  So we're going to have the first one in a few minutes here, hopefully.  I like the fact that we're getting right on it the 1st of February.  And it'll last the whole month.  Yes.  We'll be on it every day.  I request that we look at Styx from Happy Days.  Yes.  I'd throw that out there because that's where we're going with this bit, by the way.  They call him Styx because he was skinny, by the way.  Yes.  Oh, was that it?  No.  Because he played the drums.  He played the drums.  He didn't play the drums?  Actually, no, he did.  But that's not why they called him Styx.  Yeah.  And he was offended? 
[01:07:30]  I remember that.  Was he really?  How did that play the drums, man?  Oh, really?  What, do you think we all play the drums?  That's actually where I learned.  But he did play the drums.  But he did play the drums.  That's what it was.  They call you Styx because you play the drums.  Hey, man, no.  But wait a minute.  White people don't.  But you do play the drums.  Yeah, no, I do.  But that's not why they call me Styx.  But white people don't think that every black guy plays the drums.  That's ridiculous.  It's a rhythm thing.  Yeah, I understand, but.  I learned on Happy Days that we think that.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  In the 50s.  In the 50s.  Right, right.  We learned a lot about what we thought in the 50s.  I actually found out on Happy Days that all of that marching and fire hoses on children  and stuff was trying to teach white people that not all black people play the drums.  Yeah.  That was the game that was made mostly.  They're called Styx sometimes because they're skinny.  They're skinny.  Hey, put up one of the really good pictures from yesterday.  I want to do some with Louie in a second here.  Hey, I want to do a speed round with Louie C.K.  All right.  Pats or Giants? 
[01:08:30]  I'm from Boston.  Pats.  All right.  Yeah.  That's it on that?  I know it's a speed round, but I know I'm hoping for a little more than just.  Sorry.  That doesn't make a good radio.  Do you care about the Super Bowl?  Yeah, I guess I do.  I do like the Patriots.  And I like that they cheated and that they're winning.  I actually think an asterisk is a badge of honor in any sport.  I think it's awesome that not only did they win every game of the season, they cheated. 
[01:09:00]  And nobody cared.  No one cared.  They weren't forced to stop playing.  I think cheating in sports is fine.  Of course.  You think so?  Yeah.  Everyone's doing it, too.  It's sports.  It's sports.  Especially in the NFL.  They were all doing what the Pats were doing.  They just got caught doing it.  Yeah.  So what?  Good.  All right.  Enough of that.  Obama?  Yeah.  Or Clinton?  I don't know.  Really?  Yeah, I really don't know.  You go either way on that one?  Do you care? 
[01:09:30]  I kind of do, yeah.  I would think you're more of a Democrat.  I am more of a Democrat, but I hate Democrats.  Why?  I'm very sort of holding my nose to vote guy.  Because I fart in a voting booth.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  I like Obama.  I like him.  I like listening to him.  But really, I mean, it's so stupid, because my arguments are totally shaped by the propaganda.  Because I actually will be in the shower thinking, he's very charismatic, but does he have enough experience? 
[01:10:00]  And then I go, what am I saying that for?  Somebody told me to say that.  Yeah.  Because you heard that somewhere.  I heard that I'm CNN, and now I'm saying it in the shower.  I'm a tool of the media.  But we're all like that.  You read one political book, and then you think you're an expert.  Or you could get right on Meet the Press and discuss the issues.  Yeah, exactly.  Well...  Because you just repeat crap you read in a book.  Yep.  It's not your opinions.  Hillary's a smart Democrat, but she's not likable in her personality. 
[01:10:30]  No, I can't take Hillary.  She really makes me mad.  I hate her.  But I loved her husband.  I really...  Bill.  ...enjoyed him.  Well, he'll be the first lady.  That'll be fine.  Are you scared?  Back in the White House.  Are you scared that this country might have a black president?  No, I'm not scared.  What are you laughing at?  We've been discussing this for a while on this very program.  Yeah, this has been a very...  I don't think it'll hurt anybody.  Wait, you say no?  No, I'm not afraid.  That answer is... 
[01:11:00]  ...false.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, I swear.  Oh, hey.  I'm learning something about myself.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  What is there to be...  Is there something to be afraid of?  Well, ask Anthony.  Ask Anthony.  Well, it's not really afraid.  Do you think he'll actually go like,  All right, brothers.  No.  Go ahead and do whatever you want.  See, that's why it's making me look silly by saying this stuff.  Because everybody thinks I have this impression that he's going to take office. 
[01:11:30]  They're going to swear him in.  The second he's sworn in, that hand's going to come off the Bible in a black power sign.  Yes, exactly.  And everyone's going to know.  It's going to be one code word.  Yeah.  He's actually going to take the Bible and beat the...  Yeah, beat up the chief justice with it.  The chief justice, and it's all hell will break loose.  Pandemonium.  I don't think that.  Yeah.  I just think there's a lot of subtleties here.  I do.  I'm just not afraid of it.  I'm just...  You're welcome.  I got good locks on my door.  I'm not worried about it. 
[01:12:00]  You welcome it.  Yeah.  I just...  I think the changes will be subtle.  There'll be subtle changes.  Like what?  Based on the fact that...  A few things.  Black people, in general, will now have to deal with the fact that they have the opportunity  in this country to become president of the United States.  Yeah.  That's a huge thing right there.  It's very hard to cry that you're being held back when the leader of the country is, in 
[01:12:30]  fact, a black guy.  Right.  So that will affect things.  I don't know how, but that's a little...  That'll affect things.  The other thing is, a black guy in the White House, a lot of black people will be like,  hey, our guy's in there now.  Yeah.  So now, you know, we're going to get what we're due. 
[01:13:00]  We're going to get what we're due.  There's going to be a lot of pressure on Obama to, you know, placate, to make concessions  to the black community at large.  And I think a Congress, especially if a Democratic Congress is in there, will give him a lot  more than they've given stupid George Bush, old white guy, you know, everything.  I don't think so.  I think what's going to happen is that everyone's going to realize that it doesn't matter. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know that he'll be a good president, but I think black people will be disappointed  that they didn't get a check in the mail for having a black president.  Well, that's another problem.  I'm with you on that.  Well, that's what I was saying.  There'll be this expectation from black people, and perhaps that won't come about.  And also, you know, yeah.  I just believe the system is in place that one guy can't make that many drastic changes  to the way we live our lives in America. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  I think those days are long gone.  We used to have great leaders, that one guy that really did a lot and changed his country.  I just don't see that being possible in the year 2008.  I think also that there's something that happens to the president when he gets there.  We've talked about it here.  Oh, right, right.  All right.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I've got to give you credit, because we went down that road yesterday, and I forgot who  told us.  Were they giving the tour of the White House?  Yeah.  And scare the crap out?  They put him in a room and say, here's who really killed Kennedy. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  They spill the beans.  We eat poor people, they're in the food, or whatever it is.  Yeah.  And the next day, he's going to be like, okay, well, let's not be too hasty, you know.  But he's not even saying he's going to do, he's not even like a big, like Ralph Nader  is thinking of running because he hates, because he thinks Obama's a wimp.  Right.  And that Obama's just a status quo jerk.  Yeah.  So that's, you know, he's not even like, it's not Jesse Jackson.  If Jesse Jackson was running it, I'd be like, oh, okay. 
[01:15:00]  Now there might be a problem, but you just see Obama as...  It's because he's an activist, and he's nuts, and he, you know, he would scare me, because  like, he marches against barbershop, because, you know, he gets movies, he's an idiot.  But see, this is, you're making my point.  You're making my point for me.  That it's going to be an insipid little change.  That it's not so much, because we know that the president himself really doesn't have  this almighty power to do things like that.  But it's more, and I said this yesterday, it's more the symbolism of him in office that 
[01:15:30]  will make the impact of amongst black people than it is the reality of him in there.  So you're afraid of black people having a little bit of pride and hope?  No, no, they've had...  You think that's going to make them more dangerous?  True.  Ah, okay.  See, I love...  You think that's going to make them a little more dangerous? 
[01:16:00]  I love when, whatever I say, you have to put other words in my mouth.  No, that's the fun part.  I didn't say that.  I'm just saying that there will be this expectation amongst black people.  And I think Obama is going to...  That stuff will be better.  Right.  Stuff's great.  If he's the president, stuff is as good as it's going to effing get.  The easiest...  There hasn't been an Asian president yet.  So why aren't the Asians next in line to come up and say that they're the downtrodden and 
[01:16:30]  the spit-spat-upon?  Because they're good at math and...  Yeah, whatever other stereotype you could dredge up.  It's just...  I haven't seen an Asian drunk in a long time or a drug addict.  That's true.  That's all.  But, no, the thing, the easy way to make fun of you, the thing it sounds like, is that  you're generally intimidated or afraid of black people.  You're uncomfortable around them.  I am.  But it's balanced.  You've seen me talk to Patrice.  I have. 
[01:17:00]  And I've seen how you look at them.  Yeah.  But there's a balance that you feel because you know in the big picture they're losing.  Well, you're worried about getting gas in the middle of the night and there's some brothers  listening to, you know, the hip-hop's coming from their car and that you look at them and  they go, oh, God, and their guy's the president, too.  Oh, I see.  True.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah.  I can't win this game. 
[01:17:30]  It's hard, right?  We've been going at it for a while.  Yeah.  It makes for some fine radio.  It's our election commentary.  Yeah, sure.  It's great, though.  It's a very honest reaction you're having.  Yeah.  You know what?  It's Whitey's reaction.  I'm the voice of Whitey.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  I've been laughing at Anthony, but there's a lot of people that agree with him.  No, because...  They call every day when we hit this subject, so...  Look, when you're white and a black guy's, like, waiting on you or something and he's  being really nice, the party's like, yeah, no, the day the tables turn, you're going 
[01:18:00]  to cut my head off.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just going to be...  My politics are really...  It's not going to take it.  My politics are really simple.  I want to see a black president, because I want to be alive to see what happens.  That's all.  Oh, you just want to see...  I just want to see...  You're just bored.  Yeah, I just want to, like, all right, we got a black president.  Now, I'm going to take a look and see what that really means to you.  That's what I'm like.  Why not?  I'm a spectator.  Instead of another white guy.  No, I'm...  Another old white guy.  I want something different in there.  I'm totally a spectator.  I want to just check it out.  Every time there's a special report on the news...  It hasn't happened in a while, but every time TV is a special report, I'm like, ah, they 
[01:18:30]  shot somebody in the 9-11 again.  You're going to get the popcorn.  You like tragedies, too, right?  I love watching crazy stuff go down, yeah.  And don't you wish...  So exciting.  I brought this up a couple weeks ago.  Like, when you see the wildfires out west, you want to see that just keep spreading and  spreading.  Yeah.  When they say 100 homes have been destroyed, you're kind of disappointed that it's not  200 yet.  But did this...  No, and you want to see, like, you know, Allie McBeal or somebody, or whatever her name 
[01:19:00]  is, Calistro, Flockhart, coming out of her house on fire.  Like, man on fire, you know?  The worst or better, but...  You know, running on fire and screaming.  The worst or better, and we're not saying anything too crazy here, but here's the question  I got for you.  When do you really want it to stop?  Like, in my head, I like seeing wildfires or whatever just keep expanding and expanding  and expanding.  When does it get to the point where you're like, okay, all right, no, stop.  We got to put this fire out.  My house.  That's easy.  My house is exactly the line. 
[01:19:30]  You know, when you see those...  My neighbors.  Yeah, screw them.  You know what?  My yard, even.  Hurricane Katrina was a tragedy, but when that thing started spinning toward New Orleans,  eh.  Yeah.  You were kind of going, this is going to get interesting if it hits New Orleans, and I kind  want to see what that means.  People like action movies, right?  Right.  And as long as it doesn't involve you, if you're watching it on the news, it's just an action  movie.  Well, that's what it is.  You don't know the people.  Well, like the day before, Katrina, when they were saying, I mean, it was so clear.  I've never heard such an accurate weather report in my life.  Well, right on. 
[01:20:00]  They said, this is going to happen.  And I remember, they said, everyone's just going to go to the Superdome or whatever it  is.  Yeah.  And I thought, that's crazy.  Those people are all going to die.  I'm not doing nothing tomorrow but watching TV.  It was like an ad for here, you know.  Oh, good.  That's on tomorrow.  Speaking of tragedies, Britney Spears.  Yeah.  Do you care?  Are you watching?  No.  I mean, she's just one of millions of people in America whose lives are disgusting to look  at. 
[01:20:30]  She's a very average American girl for her age.  Are you hoping she gets better?  I have no hope or care.  No, there's no feelings.  Just nothing there.  I have definitely masturbated.  Is that going to get bleeped?  I don't know.  Probably.  Okay.  I have definitely done things to my person while looking upon her in the past.  Right.  And I kind of like all versions of her.  Like, I definitely did wrongful fantasizing about her when she was a little, when she 
[01:21:00]  was a little Britney.  Not, not, not, not, not, not little, little Mickey Mouse Club, but yeah.  When she was being portrayed as the virginal baby, baby, I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  Put on those sweatpants.  Yeah.  And then, but then when she became pregnant, Britney pumping gas into her SUV, I was like,  that's awesome.  I definitely do have a weird thing about her that all the just tragic versions of her are  very sexy to me.  Right. 
[01:21:30]  Okay.  And I like, I like fat Britney.  You do.  I like it.  Yeah.  Turns me on.  All right.  And now, she's dirty.  She's a dirty girl, but I don't care if she died tomorrow.  I would, there would be no feelings inside of my body.  I would just go, oh, that she's dead now.  All right.  And one other thing before.  I guess no new pictures to.  Yeah.  One other thing before we go to break.  Yeah.  Go over there and, and turn on that computer screen, grab that mic, and I want to get a  natural reaction from you.  That's all I'm saying.  It could, it could be horrific.  This is like, it could be really good. 
[01:22:00]  It could be really bad.  I want to just get your natural reaction.  Two girls, one cup.  Believe me.  Just Jimmy's mic, Iraq.  Just grab Jimmy's mic.  Or yours.  Okay.  Turn on that computer screen.  Show them where to turn it on.  Okay.  And just get, and just, I just want a natural reaction to what you see on this computer screen.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Hmm.  Oh, man.  What's in her thing?  What?  Wait a minute.  No. 
[01:22:30]  No.  No.  No.  I'm not seeing anything.  What am I supposed to be seeing?  All right.  You're gay.  No, you're just, actually, you're just supposed to be seeing that.  You're supposed to be turned on by that?  It's just kind of, well.  It's kind of gross.  The lighting, the lighting is so awful.  And there's plastic everywhere.  And she looks scared.  Well.  It's the last frame of a snuff film before the snuff part.  She's about to get murdered.  Do you like Huey Lewis in the news?  There's some weird whipped cream on her wrist. 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  Yes.  It doesn't turn me on.  All right.  Don't describe it too much, because that's where we'll have a problem with the show.  But we were thinking you'd have a different reaction.  What did you think I would react like?  Holy mother of F.  Really?  That's, I mean, but that's just.  Mother of F.  That isn't the best picture.  I'll tell you that right there.  That isn't the best picture.  No?  I don't care about that.  No.  All right.  Well, the picture's up.  I can walk by that and give it a nod and go, hey, how's it going?  It was part of a bit we did yesterday called Sherry Darts. 
[01:23:30]  Uh-huh.  And if you go to the website that's named after this radio show, you can see the pictures  and the videos.  We thought we'd get a little bit.  The thing is, you know why it doesn't, that's, if I had never seen the internet, I mean, that's  a picture of some girl's ass on the computer screen.  Right.  It's like a dollar bill.  It's just.  You know why that's, that's, that's pretty graphic.  There are pictures that are just of her standing there that blow that picture away.  Can you get rid of that window that you just put there for a second? 
[01:24:00]  I thought that that was poo.  Oh my God.  Like somebody had stuffed some.  Oh, you, but you know something with our, with our track record, you should expect that.  That's exactly it.  Well, that's what you're showing.  It's Opie and Anthony are showing me a picture of a girl.  I'm like, where's the poo?  No, it was just a, what part of her did you shove poo in?  All right.  All right.  Enough with the poo.  Sorry.  They're dumping out.  We sound like we're underwater now.  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We just wanted you to see a picture of a naked girl. 
[01:24:30]  And we thought you'd be like.  I guess I was supposed to be like a guy in the forties.  How about that picture?  Hubba hubba.  How about that picture?  Hubba hubba.  The punky girl with the boots.  Yeah.  That's, she's awesome.  Except for her boobs are.  All right.  Just keep it at that.  A little depressing.  Yeah.  The fat woman next to her is definitely fat, I would say.  Yeah.  And then the girl on the end, I like, cause she looks embarrassed.  Yeah.  And that's a turn.  Wow.  You, you kind of call these pretty, pretty well.  Yeah.  And the other one looks very. 
[01:25:00]  No, now she's great.  Now she looks great.  Yeah.  See?  Yeah.  See, that turns me on.  When she's all splayed open, I just.  I don't like that kind of porn where it's like, look at this.  Right.  This, you, it goes in here.  You are absolutely right.  I'd rather just look at a picture of a nude girl.  Yeah, look.  Then somebody flipping around in some position where you're seeing everything like that.  That's the thing.  A girl like in jeans and a bra, like I could use a picture like that for days without being 
[01:25:30]  bored of it.  Slow down.  I mean, if it's.  Do you want a parka and a nun habit on them?  What do you.  How about, how about some nudity there?  Hey, something for the imagination.  A little something.  A little something.  See, that's better.  Now I like her even more.  She's got the bra and panties on.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Louis C.K.  We're going to take a break in the house and we look at our first black, are we calling 
[01:26:00]  them heroes?  Yes.  Our first black what?  Or black history.  They are black heroes.  They're people in history.  All walks of life.  Yes.  That we are paying tribute to that might not be the same people.  Because every year, Black History Month, all right, we understand George Washington Carver.  Please.  Enough about George Washington Carver.  Malcolm X.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't get trotted out much, does he?  Malcolm X.  Oh, my God.  They all do.  But we want to pay tribute to some black people that aren't getting the recognition 
[01:26:30]  and haven't over the years that they should be.  Right.  And yet they're heroes.  Yeah.  And we're going to challenge the staff.  They're going to come up with one every day.  Yep.  In the month of February.  We got the first one.  So we pay tribute.  That's right.  We got the first one after the break.  All right.  And Jimmy, back with the program.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, and Ram in it.  We play Ram in it after the break.  How was your other show, slut?  It was fun. 
[01:27:00]  It's weird to listen to what you can say.  Oh.  And it was good.  The energy was great.  Mulroney was in, who I love, and the wolf in Albany.  And I was decent at best.  Decent at best.  I do 25 hours of radio a week, and I'm on the phone, and I've just become a deaf mute.  Like, I'm not effective on the telephone.  I do that when I call in a radio show.  Like, I call in Ron and Fez.  And I wait, and I'm all nervous, and then I hear the...  You're on the air, and I go like... 
[01:27:30]  I'm all nervous, and I got butterflies, and I sit here and go, I've had a show for years.  Why am I nervous?  No, I hate that.  On this side, you got the upper hand.  Oh, totally.  Yeah, but I know Ronnie's not going to try to throw me under the bus, you know, but still,  I get all like...  He rolls his eyes, though.  He rolls his eyes.  You're on the phone with him, and he's rolling his eyes.  I've been there.  I've seen it.  He rolls his eyes.  No, I was on the phone with some radio station in Florida, and it was one of those things  where they come on, and everybody's laughing, and I'm just stepping in the middle. 
[01:28:00]  I don't know what they've been doing.  Yeah.  And the guy's like, hey, we got Louis C.K.  What about you?  What do you think of whatever it was that day?  Britney Spears or whatever?  And I was like, I don't know.  And they were like, ew.  And I could feel them immediately.  And then the guy actually said, I think we got a helicopter that's chasing a car.  He's chasing a car, so we're going to go.  Are they hung up on me?  Oh, no, for a helicopter chasing a car on the radio.  And I know the instant they hung up, Miami radio, they're just crapping all over me. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Because I said nothing.  That guy sucks.  He just had nothing on that subject.  I wish.  We can continue this after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Louis C.K. in studio today.  Louis, what are you promoting?  Well, I was going to promote that I'm shooting my new comedy special in Boston, March 1st.  What happened?  Berkeley Performance Center. 
[01:29:00]  I sold out.  We didn't even advertise, but we're pretty much sold out both shows.  How cool is that?  It's pretty cool.  But I am going to be.  Oh.  No, I'm February 14th in Buffalo at Center of the Arts, and I'm in Cleveland on February  15th at the Playhouse Square, and that's Detroit sold out.  Oh, I'm in Wilkes Bar, Pennsylvania.  I don't know when, at some point.  What place?  I don't know what place.  Somewhere in Wilkes Bar, Pennsylvania.  There can't be that many places in Wilkes Bar. 
[01:29:30]  You got a website for these dates?  Just go there.  Pretty much.  Just go outside and see where people are walking towards.  Yeah.  And that's where I'm playing.  This is all on the website, right?  Yeah, it's all on my website, lewisck.com.  But I think we might add a show in Boston just for people that didn't get tickets, because  we sold out in like two days.  That's really cool.  Yeah.  I was really surprised.  Thank you.  All right.  It's Black History Month, and we're going to do something a little different.  That's why the cool music.  I don't even know who does this. 
[01:30:00]  Who is this?  Mayfield?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, took a light to the head on stage Mayfield, and he died paralyzed, I believe.  He got hit in the head with a light.  Yeah, he hung in there for a while, didn't he?  And then the paralysis finally got to him.  Oh, hey, I wanted to say something, by the way, to this guy whose name I hear all the  time, Coke Logic.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted to thank him, because I actually went, when we went on sale, I wanted to make  sure that some Opie and Anthony fans were able to go.  And I went to the whack bag to post it, because I opened an account there once, and I couldn't 
[01:30:30]  post.  So I wrote to the administration guy and said, can I post this?  And nobody answered.  I was yelling in all caps.  I was writing, saying something.  Oh, no.  Help me out here.  So I wrote Coke Logic, and I said, and he posted it.  Oh, great.  And so some ONA fans got the tickets.  That's good.  He's a trooper.  All right, so for Black History Month, anyone can talk about Malcolm X, and Martin Luther  King, and who else?  The guy, the... 
[01:31:00]  Nelson Mandela.  Nelson Mandela.  The dude in Tiananmen Square that stood in front of the tank there.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  They get talked about a lot in February for Black History Month.  So we want to look at other people.  Also famous heroes, but I think they're not enough recognition.  There you go.  From all walks of life.  So this is the beginning of the bit.  It's going to get tough, because we challenge the guys in the office.  Oh, yeah.  Come up with one of these guys every day for the month of February.  Here's the first one. 
[01:31:30]  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American  individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot.  It is today.  Today, we honor Bub Rub, who installs Whistler tips to vehicles in a muffler shop in Oakland.  The whistles go whoop.  When you want to whoop, it's that whoop, whoop.  You know what I'm saying?  The neighbors are saying way too loud.  That's only in the moment.  You're supposed to be up cooking breakfast or something by the end, so that's like an alarm 
[01:32:00]  clock.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Yes, Bub Rub, we say woo-woo to you, too.  Whoop, whoop.  Whoop.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's how we're, uh...  Yeah, there's Bub Rub, man.  That's nice, because it's recent black history, too.  Well, yeah.  We should get the news story, because it was great.  The guy came up with a way to just make a lot of noise while you're driving your car. 
[01:32:30]  Which is odd, because black cars are usually very quiet.  Windows usually rolled up with soft music, wafting out.  As a general rule, that's what I have noticed, too.  What is this thing, by the way?  It's a whistle that goes into what?  The exhaust?  This thing is, yeah, it's a little whistle thing.  It's a little round device.  You shove it in the tailpipe, and when you hit the gas, it makes this high-pitched whistle  that you just can't even deal with.  That's so stupid.  It's just, it's nothing more than to be obnoxious. 
[01:33:00]  That's the dumbest thing.  It's horrid.  Here's the news report on it.  Nearly every muffler shop in Oakland is installing Whistler tips.  It's a piece of metal welded inside the exhaust pipes that makes the car audible for almost  a mile.  Almost a mile.  Tell me about the whistles.  The whistles go whoop!  It sounds like what?  Of course they do.  When you want to whoop whoop, it's that whoop whoop, you know what I'm saying?  Then you got the flows.  They didn't chip off the flow, man.  It's a decoration, man. 
[01:33:30]  It's just for decoration.  That's it.  That's all, man.  Decoration?  That's all, man.  Decoration doesn't make a high-pitched squeal that you can hear a mile away.  It's like a bomb is dropping.  Get ready.  There's going to be one on Air Force One.  Oh.  Oh, damn.  There's going to be one on Air Force One.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Oh, yeah.  Going to put Whistler tips on the motorcade.  Damn, you didn't.  You didn't pun.  Of course you got to pun after that. 
[01:34:00]  You dope from Cleveland.  Forgot your name already.  And here's more from the story.  Roxanne Brun says the high-pitched tone, like the squeal of a bar train that doesn't stop, is keeping her awake at night.  Police have told her it is legal.  Some neighbors are saying way too loud.  That's only in the morning.  He's supposed to be up cooking breakfast or something by the end, so that's like an alarm clock.  Woo, woo.  That guy's awesome.  You're supposed to be up.  That's only in the morning. 
[01:34:30]  Are you?  That's only in the morning.  That's only disturbing in the morning.  I look forward to who we look at on Monday.  This is going to be a good bit.  That's amazing.  We're thinking sticks from Happy Days.  How is that not illegal, though?  I know.  That's crazy.  First of all, but they said it isn't.  That's crazy.  It would make you stop at an intersection thinking maybe in an emergency vehicle.  Glass-packed mufflers are illegal.  Yeah.  What are they called?  Loud.  Glass-packed, because they have fiberglass in them. 
[01:35:00]  The ones that are crackly when you hear a car that's going to...  They put them on a lot of mufflers.  That's illegal.  Yeah.  That's illegal.  It's called glass-packed.  They're mufflers that were made badly with fiberglass, and people found out how loud  they were, so then they started flying off the shelves.  Why do people want loud mufflers?  Because they get to make that noise when they drive around.  It's cool.  It's cool.  When you gas it, and then when you let off the gas, it sounds like the car's ready  to explode.  Oh! 
[01:35:30]  Boom!  Boom!  Exactly.  See, I'm thinking like a guy who creeps around the corner, trying to talk to girls in person.  Right.  You want it very quiet.  Silent.  Very quiet.  You want fast, automatic windows.  Yes.  You need an electric car.  Bzzzzzzz.  It just rolls away.  Scott from Hop-Hog.  Great observation.  The whistle tips, they're only loud in the morning.  Does it get quiet in the afternoon, this thing?  I guess they do.  Yes.  All right.  Finally, we've got to play another horrible NFL rap song. 
[01:36:00]  This was for the L.A. Rams.  This one is unbelievable.  But these are throughout history, right?  Yeah, sure.  Break.com did kind of like the top five or six worst rap NFL songs of all time, and I  think this one is pretty much the worst ever.  I hate these.  The L.A. Rams.  Just hold on to your seat if you feel like you're going to keel over.  I did this song called Ramming It. 
[01:36:30]  Ramming It.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, God.  I like that.  Hold on.  He's dancing.  What were they going for there?  Do you know how to ram it?  Whip it, right? 
[01:37:00]  I don't know.  No.  Ram it.  I just think they were going for it.  No, it sounds like the village people song.  Yeah.  Body.  Do you feel my body?  Tying in well with the lyrics.  Ram it.  Ram it.  Do you know how to ram it?  Oh, the video is great.  They're ramming their arms forward.  It's very Eddie Murphy-ish music.  Oh, yeah.  Party all the time.  It's very 80s Eddie Murphy. 
[01:37:30]  This is the sequence where the main character is starting to make it.  Yeah.  Drinking champagne in clubs and wearing silk shirts.  It's the upswing montage.  Yep.  Yeah.  Ram it.  Ram it.  Ram it.  Ram it.  Ram it.  Somebody's counting money.  They're giving each other the thumbs up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Money's going through one of those counters.  Somebody's buying a Porsche.  Yeah.  Ram it.  Ram it.  Ram it. 
[01:38:00]  Maybe.  Ram it.  Ram it.  Ram it.  And Ram it.  Woo.  Well, Kevin from Connecticut, he just threw his arms in the air like you just don't care.  So.  That's right.  It's getting the job done out there.  Nice stuff.  Fun song.  So bad.  Oh, they're all dancing in their Rams uniform. 
[01:38:30]  That clappy.  Yeah.  Oh, a lot of clapping.  Yeah.  Oh, a lot of clapping.  The Rams get down so nobody's strong.  And don't you worry because the Rams are wrapping.  When game time comes, get it back to Zappan.  We can't sing and our dance is not pretty.  But we'll do our best for the team and the city.  So get on your feet and clap your hands.  Let's land right now with the L.A. Rams.  Hollywood, Anthony, Dodge City, tough.  If you throw it my way, it's going to get rough.  I like to ram it.  As you can see, nobody's not jamming any more than me.  He looks like, what's his name from the Bee Gees?  The thing that's awful about watching the video because they're just in the empty stadium 
[01:39:00]  is that you just picture that shoot day.  Oh, God.  Everybody has to be at a team meeting.  Yeah.  Everyone has to be here Wednesday at 4 o'clock.  Oh, what for?  We're shooting the ram at video.  It's mandatory that you show up.  I ain't going to that, man.  I ain't going to that.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  I ain't.  Ugh.  And then they stood around and it took forever.  Can we do that again?  Oh, really? 
[01:39:30]  No.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  That last line was creepy.  I like to ram it as you can see.  Nobody likes ramming more than me.  Well, it rhymes.  Terrific.  It rhymes.  It's going to get rough.  I like to ram it as you can see.  Nobody likes ramming any more than me.  The calm is either.  Nobody's just a sweater.  None of this cool is a quarterback in the street.  I come from the end looking for the sack.  I don't stop coming until I put him on the back.  This is a limousine with it.  Ramming it looking for the sack.  And this was written by a white person, too.  Of course it was.  This is rap written by a Jewish, an old Jewish couple. 
[01:40:00]  That guy looks like CJ from A Soldier Story.  Look it.  Look it.  Hey, get you.  Did he hang himself?  Yeah.  I don't want to sing ram it so hard.  Until I put him on the back.  This is a limousine with it.  My moves are like trainers.  They call me the demon on special teams.  I know how to rock from the toes to the head.  When I pull the trigger, I'll knock you dead.  I'm a mountain man from West V.A.  They call me Herc and I came to play.  I learned long ago if a ram is just right. 
[01:40:30]  You can ram it all day and ram it all night.  Now, I don't really know much about...  What year of the Rams was this?  Oh, boy.  What year?  I'm going to guess 82 or 83.  I don't think those are the stars doing the big numbers.  The big ram it number?  I don't think they got the stars.  That guy who just said, I'm a devil on special teams.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  That doesn't sound like...  He's not like an all-star.  He's not an all-pro running back.  Ram it all night.  Ram it. 
[01:41:00]  Well, I'd drive the bus that carries the team.  And I'm on the bench in case he gets hurt.  Oh, it's pretty gay.  All right.  This part where they're sitting in the hook, ram it.  They're all like...  Bent over.  They're all bent over holding on to a rail.  And they're going down the line showing all the players.  Shaking their shoulders.  And they're shaking their shoulders.  And they're wiggling, obviously, their hips.  They want to ram it.  They're into the ram.  Was this the St. Louis or the L.A. Rams?  L.A., of course.  Yeah.  That's right.  Hi. 
[01:41:30]  Ram it.  Ram it.  We are going to ram it.  Yes, it's ram it.  Everybody ram it.  We'll be rocking L.A.  No, that's very...  That's very L.A. football.  Ram it.  Yeah.  L.A. doesn't deserve a football team.  No, every time that I go to L.A. to like a...  Big Daddy Hill, take a look at my stock.  I'll catch you at the tournament and I like the block.  I'm quick off the line as I can be  because I don't want a big running over me.  This is baby face and yellow yield. 
[01:42:00]  I'm a tackling fool on the football field.  From the Jersey Shore to Boboa Bay.  If you run at me, you'll have a bad day.  This is R.B.  No, it's all brown.  Fastest man in the whole damn town.  Cars and ladies are a part of my creed.  But more than that, I feel the need for speed.  This is Catcher.  I'll have to make a run.  With shades on, I can catch a BB in the dark.  So now you're ready and I'm sure you'll agree.  The ramming is fun when you're ramming with me.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty gay.  That is so bad.  Every time I've been at any social gathering in L.A.,  every man in L.A. is gay. 
[01:42:30]  They're just all gay.  But they all come from some town  and they try to talk football at parties.  Like, oh yeah, Green Bay is awesome this year.  Like, they try to sound like they know about their team,  but they're just all...  Every man is effeminate and soft.  Fruity.  Fruity.  Homosexual would be another word.  A bunch of delicate flowers for big decisions.  Yeah.  Delicate flowers.  If you'll agree, the ramming is fun  when you're ramming with me. 
[01:43:00]  Ram it.  We know how to ram it.  Let's ram it.  We know how to ram it.  We rock it and it.  So let's ram it, is it?  Let's ram it.  We're gonna ram it, let's ram it.  Yeah.  Everybody ram it, we'll be rockin' L.A.  So let's ram it today.  Let's ram it.  That's only half the song, by the way.  Do we continue?  No.  No.  Okay, good.  Hey, I have a request.  Yeah.  You have 30 seconds to ask you for something? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  I forgot about this.  This is kind of perfect for you guys to enjoy.  One time I was here  and I needed somebody to run my daughter's backpack to her school.  Right, yeah.  Is there somebody who could run another errand for me?  What I have in my pocket.  I hope it's drugs.  It's better than drugs.  What is it?  I have three vials of my daughter's poop.  Jesus Christ.  That need to go to her pediatrician this morning. 
[01:44:00]  Oh my God.  I literally have three tubes.  They are vials in plastic baggies.  It's a six-year-old poop.  Can I see them?  I predict a very unsuccessful store, Luke.  Don't open it because you'll contaminate the spesan.  Oh!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh!  Child's poop.  Oh my God.  It's...  Really?  Is she sick or is that just standard?  Wow!  We just do it for fun.  We just like to find it.  We just like to get a breakdown, you know? 
[01:44:30]  How did you...  And you've got to be careful because, you know, I want this on the radio.  How did you collect this?  Oh, well, there's very detailed instructions inside of me.  Yeah, but see, what I'm looking at, how did you collect it?  Oh, no, no, don't...  No, that's not all that's in here.  See, it comes with a little...  It has this little...  Each vial comes with this little red liquid.  And a solution in there.  A solution in there.  And it comes, and on the top, each top, if you unscrew it, which I can't now because  it'll get contaminated, there's a little scoop. 
[01:45:00]  It's like a tiny spork.  Oh!  It's a little spoon with spikes on it.  I gotcha.  It should come with a yogurt.  Yes, and so you...  I gotcha.  Exactly.  And so you...  Because when you showed me, it looked like you couldn't use a strainer.  Yeah, no, no.  No, it's...  But it was good, solid.  And, well, one of the poops that I did was nice, solid, not too offensive.  Just scooped it in there and shook it up.  Yeah.  But then the next one was soft, and it was a drag.  Yeah.  And she was...  She's standing there watching me do it.  Oh, that's embarrassing. 
[01:45:30]  And I'm like, that...  You could have done a nicer poop than that that I have to now.  Well, you gotta do it.  Like, if you gotta...  Like, it's part of, I guess, testing for kids, right?  You have to, uh...  Occasionally, you gotta do this.  Yeah.  No, she's got weird...  I heard the doctor said I'd like some...  Samples.  I'd like some samples.  All right.  We'll, uh...  We'll give that to one of our guys.  Yeah.  Doctors might just be weird.  I'd really like a stool sample from your daughter.  Yes, please.  It would really be helpful in determining the cause of her headaches. 
[01:46:00]  We'll run it over to the doc for you.  One girl, three vials.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Just don't ask your guy not to brush his teeth with it or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever kind of stunt he wants to do.  Well, that guy would be right there.  Yeah.  There he is.  Our Amish friend.  Duffy.  Okay.  Hey, uh...  Before we go to break, we got, um...  Um...  Some audio that's just hitting the net.  I think it's a bit old, but it's still really good.  Uh...  Chris Berman.  Just losing his mind.  I think...  I believe during a commercial.  And they were rolling tape, and some guy that didn't really like him too much decided 
[01:46:30]  that everybody needed to hear this.  Chris Berman, everyone.  When I'm doing TV and I got 18...  God damn it.  Can't everybody stop for 10 minutes?  I mean, everybody seems that that's the only...  Everybody can we stick...  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's not that much to ask.  Is that when everybody has to move when I'm trying to concentrate?  Jesus.  And you guys thought I was a fan.  I mean, that's so rude.  I can't believe that that's...  It's so goddamn rude.  Just... 
[01:47:00]  Why does everyone all of a sudden have to move?  Got two f***ing hours to move around.  Wait 10 minutes.  Jesus.  I'm sorry to explode by that, but that's...  It's like no one's ever worked on TV here before.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jesus.  Duncan under the...  What the f*** do they think I'm doing?  I really...  I actually can't believe what I just saw.  Not now.  It's like no one here has worked on TV before.  Now I hear a dial tone. 
[01:47:30]  And there were seven people, though.  I mean, Jesus.  We need to use the studio for 15 f***ing minutes.  Just everybody, you know.  There you go.  Oh.  Sounds like he's never worked on TV before.  I love when people just lose their minds like that.  And it's caught on tape.  Good for him.  Fantastic.  That'll be on OARadio.com later today.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  We've got to take a break.  More with Louis C.K.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Heading into a speed round here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Going to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today?  Louis is smart.  Why is Louis smart?  I don't know.  Why?  He just is.  In what way?  Every way.  Really?  Except for happiness.  He's awful at that.  He's pretty happy.  He looks happier.  Other people's.  Something's going on with him.  He looks happier these days.  I know.  He's going on with me.  He lost weight.  He lost weight? 
[01:48:30]  I can see it.  I will.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm going to a boxing trainer again.  Oh, I hope something.  I hope.  Young Puerto Rican man.  Think Clint Eastwood movie.  I hope six months and now you're biting your own tongue in a hospital.  I hated that movie.  It was depressing.  Phone number 877-212-018.  That's the worst movie I ever saw.  Okay.  No.  I'll be fresh.  No, I guess not.  You're exaggerating.  It was bad though.  You're right.  It wasn't great.  No.  I've had enough of Clint Eastwood's acting. 
[01:49:00]  I love him.  But he's old and gravelly.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Take a seat.  Just direct.  What was the worst movie you ever saw?  Give us a go.  We got this fine story though.  You've probably heard of drunk dialing, but wait until you hear who this Wisconsin woman  called.  Pat Dykstra called 911 from her cell while driving, then hung up.  When police called her back, she told them her boyfriend thought she shouldn't be driving  because she was drunk.  I know somebody could follow me home because somebody seems to think I can't drive home 
[01:49:30]  straight.  Okay.  Why is that?  Oh, he seems to think I'm too intoxicated to drive.  Okay.  And so you called 911 or he called 911?  Well, he wanted me to call 911 because he thinks I'm too drunk to drive.  It happened after the couple left a Dodge County bar early Sunday.  Dykstra says she got behind the wheel because her boyfriend was too drunk to drive.  I don't like to get on the phone while driving.  Okay.  Well, I can certainly let you go, Pat. 
[01:50:00]  I don't want to cause you to...  I would appreciate that because I don't like driving on the phone.  Wait, that's the whole thing?  She, uh...  No, it was a little more...  Oh, did she get arrested?  Oh, well...  What happened, Opie?  Well, we'll tell you Monday.  Dykstra gave a description of her vehicle, which police traced to her Fox Lake home.  There, they found Dykstra getting ready for bed.  I was home already and in my pajamas, going to bed.  Dykstra then failed the sobriety test and got a $740 OWI ticket and a mark on her driving record. 
[01:50:30]  I think a judge will look at her and say, you know, you stepped up to the plate.  You did the right thing.  I think it's commendable.  Does she regret calling the police?  It's good in a way, but if I'd have thought about it, it wasn't good for my driving record.  You know what, man?  I don't know how they can give her that ticket because technically they can't prove where she was when she made the call.  She could have been in her driveway.  She could have been a passenger.  Yeah.  She could have been a passenger and just been drunk.  It's a confession.  Yeah, but again, they can't prove that it was an accurate confession because she confessed while she was doing it, but they can't prove where the car was. 
[01:51:00]  She confessed, but she was under the influence, so the confession's tainted.  Right.  She could just say she got a ride home with a friend.  Because she was driving drunk while she was confessing.  My brother once...  Well, why did they say she did the right thing?  I didn't understand why.  By calling?  That's not the right thing.  That's the drunk thing.  Yeah, but drunks always...  Every time I've been in traffic court, drunks...  People just love...  Courts love drunks because they want them to get better.  For some reason. 
[01:51:30]  So I go and...  You know, I drove with a suspended license, so I got arrested.  And the judge was like, you know, your record is reprehensible.  You show no remorse.  You do nothing but repeat your offenses, and I'm going to go the limit with this.  Then the next guy is like...  Give me a minute.  This guy threw a rock through a window, literally, and set a fire and then passed out in the street.  And he goes, are you in a program, young man?  He goes, yes, sir, I am.  Okay, good for you.  Good luck.  I wish you all the luck in the world.  All the luck. 
[01:52:00]  In the world.  All the luck in the world.  In the world.  I want everyone else to have bad luck so that you can have good luck, you stupid drunk from  Mansfield.  Mansfield, Massachusetts.  Just...  Joe had a little run-in years ago.  Years ago, Joe wasn't able to get a license, registration, insurance, anything.  He was like in that realm of your life when you go through that.  That's me right now.  So at the time, especially, the Reggie's were a lot different on the windshield. 
[01:52:30]  It was just the sticker.  So he drew one.  He looked at one, got some colored construction paper, and drew the lines of the ruler.  It used to just be like a grid with some holes that they punched in it on the date.  Almost like your inspection sticker still looks here in New York.  And he drew it up, taped it to the windshield, and unless you were right on top of it, it  looked perfect.  Couldn't even tell.  So his car breaks down on the parkway, and he's underneath the car, and a cop comes up 
[01:53:00]  and starts talking.  So Joe's like, let me get my stuff out of the car.  So he goes to go into the car, and the cop's kind of still looking at his tire, I think,  bent or something like that.  So Joe just scrapes the crap right off the windshield, so the cop couldn't see it.  And he goes, where's your registration?  Everything goes, oh, no, I don't have one.  And he wrote him up for everything.  Joe goes to court and just says, I wasn't driving, because my car was broken down on  the side of the parkway.  And it didn't matter how it got there or anything, because you could say I was trailering it, 
[01:53:30]  I was towing it.  So he got away without anything.  That's amazing.  And there he was driving with this forged government document.  I got arrested once at the Holland Tunnel, because this is how bad I was.  My license was revoked.  Not suspended, but revoked.  That's bad.  And I had crazy amounts of warrants, open warrants.  And the car I was driving had the plates from a different car. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, that's never good.  The cops don't like that.  No, and the plates were bad anyway.  Anyway, so, I mean, in other words, the car that they came from had expired.  The plates were expired and from another car.  For anyone that doubted, Louie was Mexican.  And I was coming through the Holland Tunnel, and I had no money.  That's where it all started.  I was one of those things where I pulled up to the toll booth and said, hi, I have no  money.  What do we do?  How do we do this? 
[01:54:30]  And the guy said, just give me your license, and I'll fill out a thing.  And I go, it's not on me.  And he goes, give me your registration.  I go, I don't have that either.  He says, give me your name and your social security number.  You just said how smart this guy is, Jimmy.  Yeah, exactly.  This isn't a smart thing.  No.  You're right.  And then he made me pull over, and I went to jail.  First, he put me in a jail cell that's under the Holland Tunnel toll booth.  There's a jail cell.  There is?  Yeah, he took me down some stairs.  Hey, you got to see something most people don't get to see.  That's right.  Unless you're a scofflaw, not a criminal. 
[01:55:00]  Exactly.  And I slept the night.  I actually spent the night.  I just slept in a little jail cell down there.  And then they transferred me to Weehawken County Jail.  And that was the worst thing that ever happened to me.  Was that one under a photo match?  Where's that jail?  Weehawken is a really bad jail.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Why?  I would not have thought that at all.  It's terrible.  People are throwing food out the windows all the time.  I mean, I almost puked just taking a bite out of a sandwich there.  Was it violent there, frightening?  Yeah, it was really scary.  It was really bad.  And Weehawken, who would have guessed? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, it's really bad.  It's mostly New York drug addicts that get taken.  Because the New York jails overflow.  And they start letting the Port Authority arrest people so that they can take them to New Jersey.  Because Port Authority is New York, New Jersey.  How long were you in for?  Like a day and a half.  I was in for a morning, afternoon, night, and the whole next day.  It was horrible.  That's a long time.  Well, and when I got there, I was in a holding cell, and one of the guys in the holding cell  said to me, don't let them take you out of this cell, because you'll never be hurt from 
[01:56:00]  again.  If you get moved to a permanent cell, they'll never find you.  They'd lose people, because it's a bad bureaucracy.  Everybody in the cell agreed, don't leave this cell.  And a cop would come once in a while and say, we've got to move you.  And I'd go, no.  He said, just say no.  I'm like, how do you just say no?  And I go, no, I'm not moving.  And he goes, come on, we're moving you to a permanent cell.  And I go, I'm not leaving here.  And he goes, ah, pfft, all right.  And that kept happening.  I just kept refusing to leave the cell. 
[01:56:30]  How do you refuse?  To say no.  Wow.  I didn't know that was an option.  Yeah.  Let me out.  It's really good.  I don't belong here.  No, and the worst part was that there was a toilet just in the middle of the floor of  the whole, like in the middle of the room.  Yeah, you would just have to sit there.  You just had to sit there and shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  There's no privacy or anything.  I bet I got dumped, even though I didn't say it.  No, I didn't.  I think you stopped it.  So wait, did you get moved to an apartment cell, you'd be there for a week, baby?  Basically, and I mean, because I made bail before I even arrived, because I used the phone 
[01:57:00]  in the, in the, in the Holland Tunnel cell, and I, I made bail right away, but it took  two days for the bail to find me.  That's right away.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's bad.  How much was bail?  The prison system is bad.  Oh, I mean, I had to pay, yeah, it was like.  Like nothing?  No, it was a lot.  Really?  It was like $600 or something.  I mean, for me, that was a lot then.  Now, now I would.  You're like, I'll pay $6 million to get out of here.  I don't have that kind of money.  Figured we could take care of it right here in Brainerd. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Give him that one.  Exactly.  Right here in Brainerd.  I just want to be in full compliance.  Oh, thank you, Iraq.  Yes.  Yes, because that helps a lot of song.  They want more stuff behind our bits.  So there you go.  Listen to this.  It was sitting on that cement right there.  For about a year, Jean Mansell has cherished her cement Jesus statue and heirloom from her  late uncle.  There was footprints behind it and footprints in front of it. 
[01:58:00]  But Thursday morning, Jean walked outside only to find that Jesus was gone.  The husband got a strong cross.  The husband got a phone call and a real grassy voice over the phone saying, check your mailbox. 
[01:58:30]  In the mailbox, a ransom note.  The note basically said they were holding Jesus for ransom.  The note reads, we are holding Jesus ransom until you clean up the poopy from your wieners and trust us, we see you take your wieners for long walks without picking up their poopy in our yards.  This has upset us, so please clean up the poopy if you want to see Jesus unharmed. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  I hate our country.  Yo, drop bombs on us now, somebody.  It is the worst.  Is that the whole story?  No, Jimmy.  What happened?  Christ escaped?  We'll tell you Monday.  Oh, look at you with the tease.  He got arrested and he's lost in a Weehawkin somewhere.  It has to be a young person because they put these little lines next to the word Jesus. 
[01:59:30]  No adult's going to waste their time doing that.  And referring to weaner poopy?  My gosh.  My gosh.  My gosh.  Put lines next to the word what?  I didn't understand that.  Yeah, next to the word Jesus.  I don't know what they mean.  Put lines.  Unless they underlined it.  Or they put it in quotes.  Quotation marks, maybe.  No grown-ups going to waste their time doing that.  Like, it's not Jesus.  It's Jesus. 
[02:00:00]  You know.  It's your Jesus.  It makes sense.  It's appropriate to put Jesus in quotes.  It's actually good punctuation they were using there.  Jesus.  This could be the greatest news story because it has Jesus, weaner, and poopy in it.  It's pretty good.  All in one.  All in one.  He, he, he.  Gene has four wiener dogs and admits there was a complaint last year about their leavings,  but says she's cleaned up every pile.  Ew.  Why can't this guy talk like a human being?  They're leaving?  They're leaving. 
[02:00:30]  They're leaving.  You're leaving.  He already said poopy like four times.  Yes.  Poopy.  Poopy.  Wiener poopy.  I think he was like, probably were going over the copy when he was doing the voiceover.  Yeah.  Should I say poopy or, you know, it doesn't seem dignified.  But I was saying poopy and quoting the letter.  Right.  I think now that it's me speaking, I should say feces.  Should I say feces?  No, that's a little too.  How about leaving?  Waist?  No.  No.  Leaving.  Leaving. 
[02:01:00]  Leaving.  Because I could say it with that inflection.  Leaving.  Leaving.  Oh.  Start Googling wiener poopy.  Let's go, guys.  There it is.  Let's go.  Wiener poopy.  We want that as top Google search for the day.  Yeah.  This is today's Google search.  Wiener poopy.  Can we hear the end of that again where he says leaving, please?  Oh.  Leaving.  Leaving.  It has to be a young person because they put these little lines next to the word Jesus.  No adult's going to waste their time doing that. 
[02:01:30]  And referring to wiener poopy.  My gosh.  My gosh.  Gene has four wiener dogs and admits there was a complaint last year about their leavings,  but says she's cleaned up every pile since.  We really built that up.  Yeah.  He just goes, complains about their leavings.  We're like, leavings.  Yeah.  I liked our version better.  She's cleaned up every pile since. 
[02:02:00]  I take my dogs for a walk.  I carry a plastic bag with me and I pick up anything that they do.  Now, Gene just wants her statue back and says she won't press charges.  I hate this guy.  That one's really bad.  I hate this guy.  She wants her statue back and says she won't press charges.  Let me do another one.  Take two.  Let me do another one.  She says she won't press charges.  How was that?  Can I hear that back?  Is there a school for that? 
[02:02:30]  Is there some place we don't know about?  Broadcasting school.  Broadcasting school where they tell you to do this.  It doesn't sound like someone's doing you.  You have to use your diaphragm.  Someone's entering you and you're needing to.  I'm leaving.  And she said, oh, that's good.  Yes.  How long?  Why?  How long is broadcasting school?  It could be four years, yes.  Or it could be a quick weekend course.  For this guy, it's like a two year. 
[02:03:00]  It's like the same as, you know, being a sous chef for, you know, the Olive Garden.  The American Culinary Institute.  Can we just hear that last part again with it?  And says, she wants her Jesus statue bag.  She wants her Jesus statue bag with me and I pick up anything that they do.  Now, Jim just wants her statue bag.  And says, she won't press charges.  All right.  That was worth it.  And says, she won't press charges.  And says, she won't press charges.  Jim just wants her statue bag and says, she won't press charges if Jesus isn't harmed. 
[02:03:30]  And I thought, my gosh, something like that's going to be safe in your yard.  Why?  It wasn't.  Why would you think that?  It's outside.  It wasn't.  It's safe in your house, in your locked garage, in your yard.  It's not safe.  It's sitting outside, dummy.  Did we take your daughter's leavings to the doctor's office yet?  Where are her leavings?  Oh, you still got her leavings in your hand.  And Louis C.K. still has them and says, he needs somebody to bring them down to the pediatrician. 
[02:04:00]  And says, the poopy from the Wiener Childs.  What is that?  I don't understand what that is.  What a word.  Who told these people that that's how we like to hear things?  We want to hear the news delivered in a phony, singy, singy voice.  And says, he sounds like an American version of the BBC guys. 
[02:04:30]  You know, BBC News.  Oh, they are really weird.  And genocide.  Like every story somehow has.  Yes.  And HIV AIDS.  There was a problem in Baghdad.  Baghdad.  Another bombing which claimed the lives of hundreds.  What kind of inflection is that?  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  Another tragedy that could have been averted. 
[02:05:00]  Let's go to Dan in Boston.  Dan.  Hey, good morning.  Today I learned that Luis C.K. is actually a Mexican.  Yes.  And the whistles go, woo-woo!  Yeah, we did learn that today.  Very nice.  Go, Pats.  Go.  All right.  I think we can squeeze one more of these weird stories in.  They've been piling up around here lately.  It's lunchtime in one of Haiti's most desperate slums.  But because of rising food prices.  It's called Haiti. 
[02:05:30]  I don't sound like mad.  It's lunchtime in one of Haiti's most desperate slums.  It's Sonny D time.  I think they're going to be eating leavings.  Leavings.  Sonny D in Haiti.  They open the refrigerator and it's just five people with bloody machetes looking at a rump roast or something.  Let's say hi to Mike in Arkansas.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  How much do hooker leavings cost? 
[02:06:00]  Leavings.  Depends on the gal.  Depends on the freshness.  It's lunchtime in one of Haiti's most desperate slums.  Because of rising food prices, some of the poorest can't even afford a daily plate of rice.  They're going to eat that baby.  Instead, they're taking desperate measures to fill their bellies.  This mother and her toddler now rely on a traditional Haitian remedy for hunger pangs.  Cookies made of dried yellow dirt.  You might have long been used by pregnant initials.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:30]  The crowd loved that.  By the way, I'm not getting in trouble for playing that boring clip over.  Why would you?  All right.  Because God wanted that played.  There's a commercial here.  I think it's a commercial that we're playing here in New York where Mike from Mike and the Mad Dog is talking about the Super Bowl.  I guess he's doing a little Super Bowl tidbits or something.  I don't even know.  But his delivery is like, I don't want to do this.  I'm being forced to do this.  So here it is.  He's going to pizzazz that guy.  I've been playing the boring clip under his commercial read. 
[02:07:00]  What happened with the dirt cookies?  They sound lovely.  Yeah, it's like yellow cookies made from dirt.  Comedy for hunger pangs.  Cookies made of dried yellow dirt.  The mud has long been used by pregnant women and children as an antacid and source of calcium.  But now cookies made of dirt, salt, and vegetable shortening have become a regular meal for some.  Food prices are up as much as 40 percent on some Caribbean islands after floods from last year's hurricane season damaged crops. 
[02:07:30]  Because of that, Caribbean leaders held an emergency summit to discuss cutting food taxes  and coming up with ways to reduce the island's dependence on imports.  Patient doctors say those who rely on the cookies are at risk for malnutrition.  And officials warn the dirt can contain deadly parasites or toxins.  This story reminds me.  That's why I had to jump in.  I was out for sushi the other night.  And the rice wasn't as gummy as I like it to be.  So my sushi fell apart. 
[02:08:00]  That's really a drug.  Did you send it back and have it thrown into a garbage pail?  I certainly did.  I said, throw this away.  No one will want this.  No.  That's what that story reminded me of.  It's worthless.  Have a dirt cookie.  They're eating dirt cookies.  Dirt cookies.  How awful.  Don't call them cookies.  No, they're not cookies.  It's dirt.  It reminds me of when, and this is true, I took my daughter to dinner the other night  and I ordered her a plate of spaghetti and a cheeseburger.  Wow.  In case, because she's fickle.  She doesn't know which one she wants.  I understand that.  A bite of each. 
[02:08:30]  If we're going to talk about food, can we play We Are the World or something?  We need some music behind this.  She took a bite of burger, a bite of the pasta, and the rest we just chucked in the gut.  Throw it away.  For the rats.  The rats eat better than the Haitians in this city.  I bet you that their cookies have some leavings chips in them.  I'm sure they do.  Leaving.  I gave my dog, I fed my dog fresh beef and vegetables for breakfast this morning.  That's true.  Fresh beef from a supermarket. 
[02:09:00]  I went to an Italian restaurant here in Manhattan and it's served what they call family style.  Ah, yeah.  And it's a giant, you get a giant platter of food.  Mm-hmm.  And it's just me and my girl.  And she doesn't like what I have.  Sure.  And I don't like what she has.  So we each had to get a giant, giant portion of which you couldn't even tell we had eaten  anything out of it.  Yeah.  And I was stuffed.  Right. 
[02:09:30]  And then they take it away and throw it in the garbage.  Yeah, no.  And you throw it in like hazmat garbage so it's certain that no other people will eat it.  Right.  It's like a shredder for food.  Yeah, because it's illegal to give that food to anybody.  That's right.  And the beauty, because we are Americans, all that beautiful food that's in the dumpsters,  we don't let the homeless eat it so we poison it.  That's right.  They dump actual poison on this delicious food that the homeless would have grabbed and had  a nice meal.  Exactly.  We do that because we're Americans.  That's what we've always done.  Jimmy, you got a food story maybe? 
[02:10:00]  Well, I started with the sushi one.  I normally, I don't know.  I mean, I like to take a couple of bites out of things and throw it on the floor.  And they just say, look, this fell.  I'm not paying for it.  Then I go home.  It fell.  What about the gluttony Super Bowl Sunday?  You know, big game on Sunday.  The gluttony that's going to be.  Chicken wings.  Yep.  I'll order a pizza.  A few, about a week ago, I was driving from Louisville, Kentucky to Knoxville, Tennessee.  And I stopped at a Kroger's.  Right.  At three o'clock in the morning.  And it was open. 
[02:10:30]  Totally lit up and air conditioned and perfectly, you know, controlled.  And there was just about an acre of meat on, out on the, you know, on the shelf.  Yeah.  And no one was going to ever buy it that night.  And the next day, it would all be thrown away.  Yeah, of course.  And that Kroger's represents literally millions of supermarkets that just have, in case one  guy wants meat at three o'clock and wants a square inch of meat, they put an acre out 
[02:11:00]  there.  Yeah, it really sucks.  They got to eat dirt cookies.  And then it all throws, oh, those people with dirt cookies?  I forgot about the dirt cookies.  Why are they eating dirt cookies?  There's meat at Kroger's.  And if you want to go back a ways, I remember.  How far is Haiti from Louisville, really?  How hard would that be?  Come on.  Just make the swim.  And when I was probably a little older than these children that they're talking about  that are making dirt cookies, I remember going to Jack in the Box with all my friends at 
[02:11:30]  the end of a night of drinking.  And we would get breakfast jacks, they were called.  Right.  But we would get extra ones just so after we eat our fill, we could drive by the Jack  in the Box and throw them at the big windows in front and just watch them slide down the  window.  And would we laugh as that food, that sustenance, was just oozing down the windows.  We have enough food here in this country to do funny things with it. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have to be told not to play with our food.  Exactly.  That dirt cookie story reminded me.  I had a Toll House freshly baked.  I had about eight of them, and I was only going to eat three.  And a couple of them actually had more chips on one side of the cookie than the other.  Oh, that's awful.  That's not so infuriating.  That's awful.  Hold on.  I want to make more room so I can eat.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do they deal with the anorexia problem over there?  Like, do they have to maybe force them to eat the dirt cookies? 
[02:12:30]  I guess so.  And the bulimia?  Like, does that hurt when after you binge on dirt cookies, you have to purge and there's  the pebbles that scrape your throat?  Look at the positive side.  They don't have those diseases in Haiti.  That's right.  That was...  I bought...  I went shopping the other night for my kids, and I got a chicken and some lamb chops and  beef.  And then I ended up not feeling like cooking.  Yeah.  I got takeout every night this week, and all of that food went rotten and in my fridge. 
[02:13:00]  Yep.  You just got to clean it out and throw it away or else the fridge stinks.  I know.  It's a real drag for me.  It's a real...  Molds.  Yeah.  Everyone understands that what we're really trying to say with this bit, and don't misinterpret  it, is that this Black History Month, we want to acknowledge that in Haiti, they are  spoiled.  They're what?  Spoiled.  They're spoiled.  Excuse me.  You don't have any food.  Have a dirt cookie.  I'd love to have cookies for every meal of the day.  Listen, it's not just dirt, too.  What did she say?  They had a vegetable shortening and salt in there? 
[02:13:30]  That's something.  It's delicious.  It just sounds great.  Have a dirt cookie, son.  You've been good.  In some countries, that's a delicacy.  You know when they say that?  Exactly.  In some countries, that's a delicacy.  Yeah, because they don't have any actual food.  Because they don't have beef.  Figure it out.  Poor countries.  Spit is a delicacy.  Yeah, that's why slugs are a delicacy.  They spit in each other's mouths for food because they got nothing else.  How about, I remember being a small child and my parents getting into a big fight, and my  father taking a full plate, a big platter of spaghetti, and just throwing it against the 
[02:14:00]  wall and calling my mother an F and a C. And watching the spaghetti, it was down the  wall. And it brought tears to my eyes. Not, you know, the waste of food. It was the fact  that my parents were probably getting a divorce, and I was devastated.  Well, the people in Haiti would probably happily drink those tears for nourishment now.  Of course. Well, add it to these dirt cookies. That's where the salt comes from.  Their own tears. 
[02:14:30]  Wonderful snack. Wonderful.  Oh, look, an infected toe. Let me suck on that. I'm thirsty.  I'm thirsty.  I have personally, I have probably personally poured about four million gallons of milk down  the drain. Just poured it down the drain to feed a nation. Bought a gallon of milk.  This has been repeated 50,000 times in my life. Bought a gallon of milk, made it, didn't  even drink a glass of it, made a cappuccino with an eighth of a cup of it, and then let 
[02:15:00]  the rest rot, come back home from the road and pour it out. Right. How about lunch meat?  Lunch meat? Oh, yeah. We all get like a pound of ham or turkey or something. Give me a pound.  You know what? Give me a pound, buddy.  You make one sandwich and forget that it's in the fridge and then right into the garbage.  That's it. Swiss cheese becomes cardboard. It stiffens up on it.  Teach a man to buy cookies. Boy, I screwed up. 
[02:15:30]  I've never actually read the Bible, but I just heard it's good.  Oh, wow.  It sucks.  Yeah.  Hello? Hello?  Yeah, we were doing great show.  No, that's the thing. Give a nation grain and food and rice, and they'll eat for 20,  30 years.  Yeah.  Teach them that the dirt beneath their feet can be cookies, and the whole country will  be dead in a week.  And that's how we leave you today.  Words to live by Lloyd.  Yeah, really fast. Got to get this in. We're sending Sam and Big A to the NBC Night Rider premiere 
[02:16:00]  party at the Playboy Mansion, and we want you to join them. This is what you do. You go up,  you go to onaradio.com and register to win the trip to L.A. to the Playboy Mansion. And  also, don't forget, watch the Night Rider movie event Sunday, February 17th on NBC. We  got to get out of here. Louie, big plug or what? What do you got?  Buffalo Center for the Arts, February 14th, and Wilkes Bar at the Something or Other Center  on March 7th.  That's Something or Other.  There's going to be more tickets available to my special in Boston at the Berkeley Performance 
[02:16:30]  Center March 1st. We're going to get tickets out more somehow. We're going to squeeze  more tickets out.  All right. Jimmy, anything? You good?  I got bananas coming up next weekend in Poughkeepsie, and February 15th through 17th, I'm in San  Francisco at Cobb's Comedy Club.  Very nice. On Monday, we'll be discussing the big Pats wins.  Oh, yeah. Good luck, Giants.  What?  Good luck, Giants.  What?  Yeah.  Whatever. 
[02:17:00]  You're a Pats fan. Help me out here.  It's just sports, though.  Finally, a little dose of reality.  It's just sports.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  And the Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  It's just sports.  Excuse me.  And the Opie and Anthony.  And the Opie and Anthony.  And the Opie and Anthony.  And the Opie and Anthony.  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Something sounds real bassy today.  Yeah.  Is it?  It's me.  I'm very smooth.  Are you?  No.  Are you?  Are you?  Oh, no.  All right.  I was just talking to Chris Rock who told me he had a...  Wait, I can't hear shit.  Uh-oh. 
[02:21:30]  I'm turning my headphones off until this is...  No, it's not even about that.  It sounds muffled or something.  All right.  All right, go ahead, Louie.  I just was talking to Chris Rock who said that he had an awesome time on this show.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was really funny, man.  Yeah.  He had a really fun time.  Yeah.  We hit it off with him, I do believe.  He'll never come back, but we did hit it off that day.  He'll come back.  I'll come back.  He will.  I'm just kidding.  I think he'll only have fun in Patriceman's studio that day.  Yeah.  He'll talk about Patrice being self-destructive.  Yes.  And Chris Rock gives great advice. 
[02:22:00]  I know him nearly as well as you do.  I know him casually.  He's very smart.  He's got good instincts.  He's brilliant with the business.  Yep.  Like business.  Everything he's ever said to me as far as the business is concerned has been on the money.  No, when I was doing...  When I was making Poodie Tang, when we were in pre-production, I was...  There's this producer on the movie, Coddy Chubb, and he was like my right-hand man.  He was doing everything for me.  And Chris came up to me and said, that guy's going to take the movie away from you eventually. 
[02:22:30]  Oh.  And I was like, that's crazy.  He's my partner.  This guy's got my back.  And he goes, no, that guy is going to eventually take this movie away from you and kill you.  And it's exactly what happened.  It's exactly what he just knew it.  He didn't even know the guy.  He saw the two of us talking, and he's like, yeah, that's the guy.  That's the guy they picked to watch you and help you, and then in the end, he's going  to screw you.  Oh.  And that guy did pry the movie away from me and fuck me hard in the ass.  He learned that through having that done to him. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, exactly.  He knows...  He's good enough now at the game to go...  He just goes, oh, that's that guy who does that.  And now I'm that way.  Now I can do that.  You just know...  You can tell the future.  There's certain people and who they are, because there isn't really that much variety  in any one industry.  I've noticed that, too.  Like, if you go from industry to industry, no matter what it is, there's that guy and  this guy.  There's the guy with the nervous laugh who will sell you out eventually under pressure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's, you know, there's the dude.  There's, like, all kinds of people. 
[02:23:30]  There's the chick.  There's the woman who, like, takes...  During a meeting, she takes off her shoes and then sits kind of cat-like and says how  much she loves you, and she'll eventually fuck you up the ass with somebody else's dick.  She'll rip off some other guy's dick and shove it up your ass.  But you learn to players, because the thing they're not good at is changing shape or tactics.  They're not shape changers.  No, they're not.  They're just...  Very obvious.  They're vicious, but they're not... 
[02:24:00]  You know, you can walk around them once you learn to drink.  The greatest fuck you in entertainment history is the Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney thing.  What was that?  Where Michael Jackson owns, like, you know, the Beatles catalog.  Right, and he sells it to, you know, commercials, M&M's commercials or whatever.  And fucking McCartney taught him how to do that or something?  Yeah, McCartney gave him some...  How does that go again?  McCartney gave him some advice.  I bring this up because there's something to this that just popped the other day, but  what's the story again?  I think it was something about McCartney kind of told him how to keep ownership or something. 
[02:24:30]  It was something about getting ownership or keeping ownership, and I guess Michael had  so much money, and I think he used it to buy a lot of the Beatles catalog.  I don't know exactly.  Some listener may know more.  Yeah, Michael owns a lot of the Beatles catalog.  I know.  They were pals, but here's where it's current.  So Michael Jackson's doing a 20th or 25th anniversary version of Thriller, like remixing it.  Oh, boy.  And doing all sorts of shit with this album.  He's trying everything, isn't he?  It's going to be a really big deal, and it's going to come out, I think, in the very early 
[02:25:00]  spring, in a month or two.  And there's no hint that Paul McCartney was ever on that album, because I do believe they  sang a song together on there.  Was that Thriller?  No, I don't think...  Was it?  Hmm.  Yeah.  The Girl is Mine, or whatever that...  Yeah, was that on Thriller?  The Girl is Mine, or whatever that...  Well, that's the song they're talking about, so...  She's Mine.  Well, then maybe it's more than...  That's mine, Paul.  That's fair.  No, she's mine, Michael.  But there's no hint that Paul McCartney ever collaborated with Michael Jackson. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  I thought it was the anniversary of the Thriller CD.  I might be wrong.  Maybe it's the Thriller CD, and they threw some other things in there.  Now I need to find the story.  What about the one with the video where they're in the covered wagon thing, and they're traveling  around with the elixirs, and then they put on a little stage show.  Awful.  And then he did Ebony and Ivory also, right, with Stevie Wonder.  Stevie Wonder.  I think that was symbolic of racism.  I like the Blackfellows making...  Is it that piano, you dummy?  Yeah, but piano...  Because you're saying, like, Ebony and Ivory live side by side on my piano keyboard. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, Lord, why can't we?  And I think that he was talking about, like, why can't black people and white people...  No, that's stupid.  He was talking about how the keys on the keyboard, some of them are black and some of them are  white.  And they're next to each other.  Yeah.  They would have been more obvious, I think.  Okay.  Yeah.  And also, black and white people are like, they can't get along.  Oh, not like keyboards.  What an idea that is.  Not like the keys on it.  Do you ever see...  No, it's not even close.  Do you ever see the minor key on a piano rape one of the other keys?  No.  Never.  Never. 
[02:26:30]  Excellent way.  It never pulls a gun out and shoots the other black keys.  Yeah, the white keys don't own and whip the black keys.  No.  But there are more white keys, and they are...  There are more of the white...  And the black keys have to kind of fit in.  And the black keys are also a little off key, like they're sort of like weird keys.  It's like a little strange...  Off, out of the mainstream keys.  Fan knows a lot about pianos, and he doesn't use the black keys at all, from what I hear.  You stay away from them?  He stays away.  He's so racist.  Yes.  I only play things in C or A minor for you. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, see.  There you go.  That's how...  Excuse me.  He actually is quite the accomplished pianist.  That would be a great code for racism.  That club is only an A minor, if you know what I mean.  Or you could just listen to a song and know you're listening and go, he didn't use one  black key in that.  Exactly.  I know what he's going for here.  Exactly.  Hey, Chris Burman.  Black History Month, by the way.  Yeah, Chris Burman, listen.  That was our little tribute.  You know, because we played this earlier, but satellite radio, you get the curses, so here 
[02:27:30]  we go.  Now you get it uncensored.  Chris Burman losing his mind on live TV.  Not live TV.  This was in between takes, I guess.  He was doing something for Monday Night Football.  I think the year is 2000, and it's up there somewhere on the internet.  Maybe Breakdive.  I don't know.  Danny found it somewhere.  I know it'll be on onaradio.com.  Steve will link it on that website for sure.  When I'm doing TV and I got 18...  God damn it.  Can't everybody stop for 10 minutes?  I mean, everybody seems that that's the only...  Everybody can we stick... 
[02:28:00]  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's not that much to ask.  Is that when everybody has to move, when I'm trying to concentrate?  Jesus.  And you guys thought I was...  Jesus.  I mean, that's so rude.  I can't believe that that's...  It's so God damn rude.  Why does everyone all of a sudden have to move?  They've had two hours to move around.  Wait some minutes.  Let's get the bleeping.  The whole reason why we're playing it today over here for a second time.  Were we supposed to say fucking over it?  Maybe that beep wasn't ours. 
[02:28:30]  No, no, no.  I...  Say it.  What happened, OB?  I fucked up.  How?  Played the wrong one.  You fucked up by letting E-Rock do something.  Yeah, no.  I fucked up.  How?  I had a scary murderer, like, chase me all night long in my dream.  Oh, honey.  To the point where the dream was so exhausting, I had to wake up.  It was more exhausting than scary.  Oh, yeah.  I'd find a place to hide in a town or something, and next thing you know, I get some kind of...  Scary murderers right there.  I get some communique that he's getting close again, so then I have to take off again. 
[02:29:00]  This dream was exhausting, and I woke up, and I just, like, I slapped my face a few times,  just wake up, shake up the brain so the brain forgets this dream, and we'll try another dream.  What are you afraid of facing?  I fucking love nightmares.  No, he did.  He's not afraid.  He faced it.  That means you worked it out.  He was running away from it, and it keeps getting close, and he keeps hiding.  No, when you work hard at something.  Dream analyzing blows.  No, I'm very good at it.  Dream analyzing.  No, you're not.  I dreamt I was fine.  All dreams mean the same thing. 
[02:29:30]  It's the Jews trying to control your mind.  That's what every dream is.  Every dream is that.  But I'm tired, because it was exhausting.  It was just exhausting.  Nightmares are exciting.  They're fun.  I love having nightmares.  The scarier, the better.  You wake up, you're like, holy fuck!  But it's like you were in some cool movie.  And then you're up, and everything's fine.  You had, and I've talked about this before, you have the hugest life-threatening fucking 
[02:30:00]  problems.  Right.  And in a second, they're gone when you wake up.  It's like, that's fixed.  That is the greatest.  Thank God, because I was up for murder of somebody.  The one I have all the time is being in an airplane, and we're flying through a city.  Like, I'm like, there's no way we're not hitting those buildings.  I've had the one.  And the pilot's like, apologizing.  I know we're a little low.  Please bear with me.  But the thing about that dream every time is that I tell myself, this time, this is not  a dream.  I always dream this.  Yeah.  But this is real, and I'm just sure it's real. 
[02:30:30]  I have that one all the time.  Like, we go to takeoff.  It's always on takeoff.  And there's trees and a field, and I'm like, oh my God, I could hear we don't have enough  power.  Yep.  We're not off the ground, and we're going into the trees.  Always.  And the plane never fucking takes off right.  And I'm the same way.  I go, I know this is a dream.  This is, yep.  But every time it happens, like, holy shit, why the fuck? 
[02:31:00]  That's your mind telling you.  It's just symbolic of being afraid that your plane is going to hit something.  But that's abstract.  You really go deep.  Anthony's on to something, though.  When you wake up from a horrific dream where you think you're going to prison for life,  I don't know, whatever it is, and you wake up and realize it was just a dream, it is  the greatest feeling ever.  That's the biggest one I have all the time, is I'm just hanging out, and then it hits me,  and my memory goes, wait a minute, I fucking helped people kill somebody. 
[02:31:30]  Well, that's what, I always have a dream that I murdered people.  Yeah.  And they're buried somewhere.  I'm in a room, and they're knocking on the door to make me pay for my murders.  Really?  And I'm like, that's it.  This is the end.  See, I don't get that.  I get the one where I've killed somebody, and they're, after years, they're on to me.  Like, the cops are starting to come to the door and go, uh, we found something, and then  I'm like, and I start thinking, I'm going to fucking be in prison for my whole life,  because I did do this.  I'm like, I did it. 
[02:32:00]  And then you wake up and go, ah, good.  Case dismissed.  I dreamt that I was driving a bus, and I drove a bus into a crowd at an intersection  and plowed down about 40 people and killed them.  Oh, fantastic.  And then everybody was at the bus windows, banging on the windows, trying to get in at  me.  That's actually what I jerk off to.  And then I woke up and thought, oh, thank God.  Mm-hmm.  I dreamt the other day, and this is the truth, and I actually talk about this in therapy.  Yeah.  I dreamt that my mother walk into my room, but the room I live in now, and took a cat litter 
[02:32:30]  box full of cat shit, and dumped it into the trash in my bathroom, and I said, don't  do that.  Don't leave that in here.  And she belligerently dumped the cat shit into my fucking bathroom garbage can and then  walked out.  Wow.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I actually dreamt something.  Hopefully it means something, not just, I don't want mom dumping cat shit.  I actually dreamt, Dylan.  I have a friend who doesn't talk to me anymore.  Like, I have a friend who broke up with me.  Why?  I don't know.  Like, I broke up with you. 
[02:33:00]  I wrote him an email saying, I'm not sure what happened, but I miss your friendship.  And he never wrote back.  He just doesn't talk to me anymore.  And I had this dream the other night that I was at his father's funeral.  I don't think his father is really dead.  But that he's Jewish, and that at a Jewish funeral, the father gets, his father gets  put into a giant garlic, a big, like, head of garlic.  A clove of garlic, or head, yeah, whatever.  A big giant head of garlic, and that he wanted me to carry this big head of garlic to the 
[02:33:30]  funeral.  Means a lot to the Jewish people.  But it wasn't, it wasn't part, he's like, I just need you to carry it to the thing, and  then stop, and then we'll take it from there.  Oh.  Like, I was just carrying his dead father in a giant garlic.  Yeah.  As a favor, and he wouldn't even, I'm trying to make small talk with him, he wouldn't  even talk to me while I'm doing it.  And then at one point, he's like, okay, that's fine, I'm like, because I'm not Jewish, he  wouldn't let me come the rest of the way.  Well, selfish, maybe he was sad about his father being dead, and you're thinking it's  about you.  That's right.  Maybe he's fucking sad that the man who raised him is now in a garlic head being carried  by a fucking red-haired creep.  So what? 
[02:34:00]  Maybe he should have fucking snotty Jew.  Who gives a shit?  But wait, no, like, that's the oddest thing, too, is when dead people show up in your dreams.  Yeah.  And stuff, and you hang out.  Like, my father occasionally pops into my dreams.  That's real, by the way.  And then you're like, you're like hanging out and talking, it's like, hey, you don't  even think twice about it.  And then you wake up and go, ew, that was creepy, he's been dead.  But he's still alive in your dreams.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, there's actual communication going on.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, if you read a book or two on your death, they experience that.  How come it's usually hanging out, talking, and not driving drunk in his pickup truck 
[02:34:30]  with me in the passenger seat, scared shitless?  What is he saying to you in the dreams?  Nothing.  They're people, Anthony.  It's small talk.  Don't hate them that much.  They're people.  No, no, he wouldn't say that.  No, you must.  In anyone's wildest dreams.  He's making sure you carry the torch for the kumias.  Yes.  Do not forget the lessons I taught you when you were five years old.  Or you just wanted to go outside and play.  Well, this guy says, Tom in Philly, I had a dream that the show I listened to five hours 
[02:35:00]  a day once pretended to drop bra bombs on a TV station.  What a nightmare.  Then he woke up and realized, we never did that.  Yeah.  I'll never bring that up.  And then you get Thomas from Dallas.  Were you dreaming, Opie, were you dreaming that you were the young Opie and the older Opie  was out to kill you for the blimp thing?  Linger longer.  Should have.  All right, back to Chris Berman.  It's interesting because the two things I know about you is running away.  Scared.  What do you mean? 
[02:35:30]  Because the one story that really resonates to me about you is the one where they taught  you about sex in school.  Oh, yeah.  That was horrific.  And then told you that your parents know and then you ran into a tree.  Oh, yeah.  An apple tree.  An apple tree.  A very poetic tree.  I was 11.  It wasn't even like a fern.  It was an apple tree.  I was 11 or 12.  That's the real George Washington story, by the way.  Well, I was, you know, back when you're 11 or 12, you're getting your sex, you know,  knowledge from other kids that sort of like get a tidbit here.  That was good enough for me. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, exactly.  To see the film and then be warned that the parents are prepared for you to come home from  school so you could have a longer discussion on this.  I wasn't ready for that.  No.  I just wasn't ready.  Totally.  And your parents know.  What?  And there's no exaggeration.  Because I, as a kid, I loved climbing trees that like the taller, the better.  I mean, I would get kind of crazy with the, you know, the climbing of the trees.  And yeah, I ran right up the apple tree.  And I remember like it was yesterday, my dad looking up at me going, come on, it's not  going to be that bad. 
[02:36:30]  Come down.  No, it is.  We'll just, we'll just talk for five or 10 minutes.  I'm like, no.  Oh, it's awful.  But that's interesting because that fear, which is not everybody reacts to that.  That's 12 years old, though.  No, I know, but not everybody, nobody, not everybody reacts with fear to that situation.  Right.  You react to it with fear.  And there's something about that in your fear and these dreams, these exhausting running  away things.  Well, your hormones have to.  I think it's the same person.  You know what it comes down to, though, in that case?  When you're learning about sex, your hormones got to be ready.  They got to match up.  That's right.  Like, I developed very late. 
[02:37:00]  So for a 12-year-old, I still want to hang out with my GI Joes and my stupid bike with  the baseball card that made the noise a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  I wasn't ready for that crap.  All about fucking.  Your hormones got to be ready.  You start feeling some shit.  You're like, all right, tell me what this is.  I need to know if this is cool or not.  I was already showing my dick to the retarded girl down the street.  It was all about just sex at that point.  11 or 12?  No.  12 is 7th grade, isn't it?  Oh, I was fucking 2nd grade.  2nd grade. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, yeah.  2nd grade, yeah.  It was always about, like, girls with me growing up and being a kid.  Like, the first time I kissed a girl, I think I was probably 6 in the basement of this shitty  apartment building.  And then she started kissing this other kid named Keith right in front of me.  I was like, you fucking little bitch.  I didn't say that.  I was like, you poopy head or something.  Well, I remember in 3rd grade, there was a girl named Debbie Fuller in our class, and  we all talked about wanting to fuck her. 
[02:38:00]  I fucked the shit out of her.  Yeah, sure.  And in 3rd grade, and one time I was in class, and we had this little loft that you could climb  in, in 3rd grade, in my classroom, and John Ryan was in there, this fat kid, and he had  his little dick out, and he was jerking it off and saying, I want to fuck Debbie.  And everyone was just sitting around.  Wow.  We were all just sitting around, and one of us had his dick out, and he was jacking off.  3rd grade.  Jesus Christ.  My daughter's in kindergarten.  Where did he get that?  Well, I don't know.  I don't know where he's at.  I was way behind. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  I know.  I don't have any of those stories from when I was younger.  I remember I loved Kelly Howell when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade.  I had such a crush on her, but I had shit my pants a lot in school.  Did you shit your pants a lot?  You were a pants shitter?  Horrend.  It would always smell like rust.  And I was standing in line one time, and Kelly Howell was right behind me, and she's  like, did you go poops in your pants?  And it was my first attempt at sarcasm.  I'm like, yeah, sure.  It doesn't work when it's true, though.  No, of course it doesn't.  It was a confirmation that I had indeed flat. 
[02:39:00]  I had flat.  It looked like a fucking shit nail head.  Like, I had flattened it by sitting on it.  It was cold.  There's nothing worse than fucking cold, rusty-smelling shit in your underpants.  Oh, that is horrid.  Yuck.  And she knew you shit yourself.  How could she not have?  Because I was standing there stiff-legging, trying to get out, smelling like shit.  I shit my pants all the time in school, because I only wanted to shit at home.  I remember I shit my pants in school once, and it was like, I just basically coated the  inside of my underwear with diarrhea. 
[02:39:30]  And I went to the bathroom, and while I'm in the stall, Michael Boyvin, the toughest  kid in school, and his gang came into the bathroom.  Come on, Wime.  And I was standing on the toilet with my shit underwear in my hands, just praying that  he wouldn't kick the door open and find me there.  Would you have been a matter of it?  And I had no choice.  I ate it.  What else could I do?  What else could I do?  I wish Michael Boyvin would have found that fucking underwear in your head.  You might not be here.  I wouldn't be right here. 
[02:40:00]  No, I'd be with him right now.  I'd be married to him.  My best shit story happened when I was 31 years old.  Really?  Yeah.  I've told it a couple times.  It was Rick, our old producer for this radio show.  I was down in Florida, and I was meeting his, what would be his future wife for the first  time, and it was a big deal.  And we went out, and we had a little lunch, whatever, and I had an upset stomach all day.  And it was when boxer shorts were really in, so you're a little looser, right? 
[02:40:30]  And I had shorts on, and I had sandals on.  And I was saying goodbye on their stoop, and I thought I could sneak out just a little  bubble fart.  And this is a true story, man.  A little nugget fell out, rolled down my leg, bounced off my sandal, and just rolled it.  Rolled to the front.  Take that with you.  Like down to their feet?  Oh, pretty much.  It could have been more perfect.  You know what it is?  It just rolled and landed right in their feet.  That was my last milk dud. 
[02:41:00]  Get all mad.  That's how they say goodbye in some countries.  That's actually how you say goodbye.  That's a cookie in Haiti.  That's how I met his future wife.  And then I said...  That's how they fell in love?  I don't feel good.  And then I just shit my brains for the next six to eight hours or something like that.  I ended up not leaving.  I had to lay down back in their place.  I ended up having just food poisoning or something was going on.  Never fucking shit myself.  Never fucking shit myself.  It was just one little nugget and I was already in my thirties.  Oh my god. 
[02:41:30]  When I was writing on Conan, I was a writer there and I was laying awake in bed one morning  like not getting up yet.  And I was sleeping in just underwear.  No shirt for some reason.  I usually sleep in a shirt and underwear.  And I just lay in there about, you know, going, planning to fart.  And just shit.  I just shit in my underwear.  And for some reason, the fact that I was in bed, mostly naked, it just really upset  me.  And I was really bummed. 
[02:42:00]  And then my phone rang and it was my friend Dino, who was one of my guys I wrote with on  Conan.  And I told him what happened.  I said, I just feel so...  I don't want to get out of bed now.  Like, I don't know.  I just don't want to move.  This was the grossest thing ever happened to me.  I don't want to deal with it.  And then I got out of bed.  I cleaned up.  And I went to work.  And I opened the door.  And the writer's assistant, this woman says, hey, I heard you shit your underwear this  morning.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And every single person came up to me.  Conan said, hey, how did that go? 
[02:42:30]  Shitting in your underwear.  And I go to Dino, and I said, what the fuck?  And he goes, I assumed you wanted me to tell everybody.  Why wouldn't I tell you?  You wouldn't have told me.  Didn't you tell me so I could spread the news before you got to work?  Amazing.  I like piss to bed stories when I was a kid.  I think the last time, though, wasn't...  And it wasn't one of those, you know, if you're just a kid, you piss to bed.  Because I never did that.  It was kind of when you're in your early teens, almost, and you dream that you're taking 
[02:43:00]  a piss.  Yes.  Right.  So you're laying in bed, and you're dreaming that you're just taking this fucking wicked  piss.  Wicked piss, yeah.  Wicked piss.  And you wake up and go like, uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Pissed all over the fucking bed.  Do you know, I did that with that dream when Louie and I were in Bonnaroo, a few years,  2003, to Tennessee.  I woke up in my hotel bed, and it was fucking my sheets wet.  I pissed my bed just a couple years ago.  Wet dreams are fucking great.  Well, when I was like in... 
[02:43:30]  You just cum in your fucking shoe to load in your sleep.  Just to stay with piss for a second.  When I was in, like, first grade, I remember I just...  I was in my bedroom just being confused, and I just...  I pissed on my bed, like, standing there.  I just...  That is confusing.  I pissed on my bed, and I remember thinking, I don't know why I'm doing this.  Wow, that's weird.  I didn't piss my...  I just pissed on it.  And then I didn't let anybody in my room for a while.  I just said, please don't go in there.  And it just got stiff with piss, and it was really depressing. 
[02:44:00]  Get rid of that bed.  So what about coming in your bed?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, when you have a wet dream.  And those are just for the very youthful.  Right.  I don't think I've had one of those in fucking decades.  But I do remember you cum, like, in a second.  Because in your dream, I guess you've been so worked up that in real life, you got a rod,  and you're humping your bed, or whatever the fuck you're doing.  And then when this dream girl, the girl in the dream, has her clothes off, and you just, 
[02:44:30]  like, touch your dream dick to her dream pussy.  Yeah, yeah.  Dream cum comes out all over the fucking place.  And then in real life, you're just shooting your load all over.  You know, a lot of times, you know.  But it feels, in your dream, it's like, it feels amazing.  But a lot of times, you're not rubbing in your dream, by the way.  No, you just, like.  You have just so much, like, sperm built up.  That's amazing, that complete mental fucking thing, then.  And there's no physical pumping.  But that's why you don't have many wet dreams if you have an active, you know, sex life. 
[02:45:00]  You gotta really.  Yeah, dry yourself off.  I've never had one.  That's why, Jimmy.  Because you're just jacking.  Wet dreams are amazing.  It's what, like, there's a cycle to this.  Because when I was in 8th grade, 7th grade, what is it, 12, 13?  Mm-hmm.  That all I needed was 12-year-old, 13-year-old Lauren Tossey in her gym clothes.  Lifting up her shirt and pulling her shorts down slightly.  Yeah.  That was the picture I had. 
[02:45:30]  And I'd come immediately.  Like, that's, to me, that was the pinnacle of sex.  Right.  Thank you.  I didn't even, yeah, no, here's the thing.  And then I grew up and I started getting handjobs.  I started fucking women, getting blown, you know, coming on asses and faces and tits.  And now I'm 40 and I'm back to the, that's all I can really get off of.  That's all you can really think about.  I'm an old-age girl showing me four inches of her belly.  Yeah.  Let's go to Florida.  What happens there?  No, and a grown woman blowing me.  I'm like, can you leave? 
[02:46:00]  This is boring.  Let's go to Greg in Florida.  Greg.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Well, I got a good shit story.  It's actually two-fold.  It's the same day.  Two-fold.  Okay.  Yeah, it's a two-fold.  Well, it was about 12 years ago.  I used to drive a truck for a bread company.  I just like how it's got old-fashioned for a second.  Two-fold.  The next one would be thrice of shit.  Well, I actually have more shit stories, but this is the best one I could say. 
[02:46:30]  But anyway, I ate something that morning that obviously didn't agree with me.  And, you know, I started feeling like getting the sweats and, you know, getting the fucking goose pimples on your arm.  And so I pulled over the truck, went out in the woods, and didn't have anything to wipe with.  So I took a dinner roll with me, and, of course, took my shit, wiped with the dinner roll.  And as I'm walking back, I saw some squirrels sitting there eating the damn dinner roll.  Wiped his ass with a dinner roll.  A dinner roll.  That's fucking great.  You're a true gentleman. 
[02:47:00]  Dinner roll.  About 30 minutes later, it hit me again.  So they're eating dirt cookies in Haiti.  He's wiping his ass with a dinner roll.  America.  I'll tell you what, it was silky.  Better than Bob Kelly's damn water flat.  Oh, shit, listen.  That could be, you know, wiping your ass with a dinner roll.  That is the ultimate.  Yeah.  Fucking, that means that we've got two years left in this country.  That's the end of Rome.  That's the end of the French aristocracy.  When you're wiping your ass with a dinner roll. 
[02:47:30]  Wiping your ass with a dinner roll.  He's very resourceful, though.  That's good thinking.  Sometimes you're proud of yourself, and it's like, well, I figured this out.  How do you have rolls and not a napkin, though?  Where were you?  You drove a bread truck.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I was at a bread truck.  Yeah, I was out in the middle, and no one.  Wait, so you opened the big, he opened the big back of the truck and took out one dinner  roll?  One lucky dinner roll and never going to make it to the dinner table.  Yeah, and then the squirrels were kind of shaking their heads as they were eating it,  so I don't know.  That part I don't believe. 
[02:48:00]  That dinner roll could have been on the table with a family going, thank you, Lord, for  these side gifts we are about to receive.  How come there are only 11 of these?  Yeah, wait a minute.  You ordered the shitters dozen.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You ordered the baker's dozen gags.  Shitters dozen is funny.  Fucking baker's dozen like an old lady I'm trying to spit out.  That's a baker's dozen.  Shitters dozen.  All right, we're going to take a break.  A baker's dozen is 13, a shitters dozen is 11. 
[02:48:30]  Let me just cap it by saying that my dog ate a full shit diaper yesterday.  Oh my God.  There's nothing.  What the fuck is with dogs?  The worst moment in a parent's life.  It's worse than anything that's happened.  She eats, well, she doesn't finish.  That's the thing.  If she gobbled it up and cleanly ate it, I wouldn't care.  But I come home and there's the remnants of a full shit diaper all over the floor, and  she's got literally a shit-eating grin.  And shit in her fucking whiskers. 
[02:49:00]  That was like sushi for your dog.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was very enjoyable.  All right, more shit stories after the break.  Good thing.  And we might have another Stan Meyer situation here, a guy that invented another car that  would make us all happy.  What happened to Stan Meyer, by the way?  Do we know?  I hear it could be hoax, but I don't know.  What Stan Meyer?  It was a real news report, though.  Yeah, I know.  All right, we'll explain next.  We started with this.  Here's Chris Berman, uncensored.  From earlier, we played this with the bleeps, but now you get it without the bleeps for 
[02:49:30]  XM.  When I'm doing TV and I got 18, god damn it.  Can't everybody stop for 10 minutes?  I mean, everybody seems that that's the only...  Everybody, can we stick?  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's not that much to ask.  Is that when everybody has to move when I'm trying to concentrate?  Jesus.  I mean, it's so rude, I can't believe that that's...  It's so god damn rude.  Just...  Why does everyone all of a sudden have to move?  I've had two fucking hours to move around.  Wait 10 minutes. 
[02:50:00]  Jesus.  I'm sorry to explode by that, but that's...  It's like no one's ever worked on TV here before.  Jesus.  I'm talking under the...  What the fuck do they think I'm doing?  I really...  I actually can't believe what I just saw.  Not now.  It's like no one here has worked on TV before.  I hear a dial tone.  I mean, there were seven people, though. 
[02:50:30]  I mean, Jesus.  We need to use the studio for 15 fucking minutes.  Just every...  You know.  The Opie and Anthony Show Award for Most Disturbing Phone Call goes to...  Donkey Sausage.  What the...  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in the microwave  and then have her roll around in that screaming donkey sausage, donkey sausage. 
[02:51:00]  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Do Jim and Dean's donkey sausage.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There's something oddly attractive about that.  That's got to be a promo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, nice. 
[02:51:30]  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Playing a little black music for Black History Month.  Yeah.  Started up today.  Black.  I see Dr. Steve on the bleachers.  Black History.  Yes.  We got a full house out there.  Dr. Steve has his show coming up on the virus.  Saturday Night Virus with Dr. Steve.  Yes.  He did his first one.  It was a big hit.  Everybody loved it.  A lot of phone calls.  It was a hit.  It was huge.  It was a hit.  What's the matter?  It wasn't a big hit. 
[02:52:00]  It was a hit.  What?  I was here.  I saw the reaction.  Yeah.  Those phones lit up with people that wanted to talk about people's dirty parts.  Pretty much.  Really?  Yeah.  Everybody wanted to talk about the erectile dysfunction, vaginal anomalies.  There was a lot of excitement when you saw Dr. Steve.  For the most part, these bleachers are filled up every week and you could give a shit.  Yeah.  But you saw Dr. Steve.  You couldn't get over to him fast enough. 
[02:52:30]  I had to go over and shake Dr. Steve's hand.  We correspond a lot, me and Dr. Steve.  Really?  Yeah.  What's that about?  Dr. Steve's a good guy.  He's like the answer man.  If you have any issues, you want to know some information on things, he's very knowledgeable,  Dr. Steve.  He's got a lot of panicked calls from me.  Has he?  It burns a little, but I'm not.  Yeah.  What is that?  It's Steve rules.  Yeah.  Hey, last time Dr. Steve came to New York, we made him check, what? 
[02:53:00]  Pat Duffy's prostate.  That was right.  Guess what, Dr. Steve?  You're going to have to do it again.  Why?  Because it's going to be his thing.  His thing?  Yeah.  We like to give people their thing.  And I mean, he's known for like sticking a finger up Pat Duffy's asshole.  It's a great use of an MD license.  Yeah, right?  We're trying to get...  He's going to be working for Doctors Without Borders and Dar Ford.  Again.  He's a great fucking intern's asshole on a radio show.  Who do we have lined up for today?  Uh, well, we're trying. 
[02:53:30]  I mean, the big get is Roland, but Roland, uh...  Roland will do it.  Roland?  He ran away.  Where's Roland?  Someone's got to get a finger up their ass because Dr. Steve's in town.  It's his thing.  We'll examine Roland's leavings.  Roland, get over there.  No!  Dr. Steve has a great voice for radio, too.  Yes, he does.  Roland.  Not doing it.  Everyone has their price.  What's the matter, Roland?  Get over here.  I know, but...  Oh, come on, Roland.  I got an idea, though.  At least get our mic so we can discuss this. 
[02:54:00]  We're not going to just hold you down and stick a finger up your ass?  Exactly.  Yeah, we've seen you fight.  No, we're going to hold you down and stick a finger up your ass.  Stick a dick up your ass.  No one wants to fight you.  We saw it when you get mad.  It's not pretty.  Why do we have Dr. Steve standing in the door like a Jehovah's Witness?  He can come in and sit down for a moment?  Yeah, can't he be a little closer?  No, he's...  That's Dr. Steve.  He's good.  Okay, I'm good.  Are you comfortable over there?  Yeah, I'm comfortable.  Yeah, he is.  He's fine.  I've been sitting all day.  And they're just going to...  He's fine.  All right.  Hey, Roland.  No.  Why wouldn't you get...  You might have cancer. 
[02:54:30]  Well, that's okay.  That's okay.  That's okay.  I'm going to be a surprise when I go to see a doctor.  You're one of those guys that you just don't want to know, right?  No, I just don't want to know.  There's a lot of us out there.  So when I do fall down and get checked in the hospital, I go, oh my God.  What would it take for you to get a finger up your ass?  This is legit.  It takes a lot.  Dr. Steve, this is legit, right?  You can't fuck around.  Your license is at stake.  Right.  He's going to put a glove on.  No, it would absolutely be legit.  He's going to put a glove on.  He's going to lube up.  And he's going to do what?  You're going to jam it in and feel around.  Yeah, he was in Pat Duffy's ass for maybe five seconds. 
[02:55:00]  Maybe.  No.  Roland, have you ever had an exam for your prostate?  No.  No?  Really?  How old a gentleman are you?  28.  You're 28.  How about if I give you $40 cash?  $100?  What if I give you $100?  $40 cash.  Like the other option was you're going to write him a check or an IOU.  Or give him merchandise.  Put a little note for getting his finger in your ass in the memo.  Let's negotiate.  Cash.  Cold hard cash.  Hold on.  Let's negotiate.  Roland books all the celebrities for our show and the guests. 
[02:55:30]  What guest do you want us to have on the show that we said no to that would be very  important for you in your career?  I think that's two.  Why don't you just fire him if he doesn't do it?  Just tell him he's fired with an iron fist.  He's done a great job for us.  Erich Logan has noticed, by the way, your job lately.  Thank you.  See, look.  You'd go behind the couch over there.  No one will see you.  You're bent over.  All we'll see is from your chest up.  And it's legitimate.  Keep your hoodie on.  And it's legit.  It's not a goof.  He's a real doctor.  So, any guess you guys passed on? 
[02:56:00]  Which guess do you wish we would take that we said no to?  Well, there's a long list.  Well, give us a couple that we have said no to.  That's true.  Let's see.  Coming up.  I'm trying to think.  Look, he's got the glove on and everything.  Dr. Steve is very anxious.  He needs to do his thing.  Very anxious.  Dr. Steve's known for this.  And we've got to keep the bit going.  Right, Dr. Steve?  Sure.  And he's actually in town doing a show.  When is your show?  Tomorrow night. 
[02:56:30]  Saturday Night Virus Show.  Weird Medicine on the Saturday Night Virus at 9 Eastern Time.  Answering medical questions and we have a special celebrity guest.  Oh, cool.  It's Kevorkian.  Yeah.  Nothing?  What are you swinging missing on a Kevorkian joke?  What do you think?  Look, we're moving the couch.  It's easy.  Oh, I don't know.  Pat Taufey, come on in here.  He is real and he's not going to fuck with you.  I think we know he's going to.  It's actually for your own benefit. 
[02:57:00]  I don't know.  I'll be honest with you.  It's not a pleasurable thing.  I know.  But it is for your own benefit.  If you find out that you have a healthy prostate, everything's fine.  My dad had one last week and he goes, ugh.  Yeah, it's not a comfortable thing, but it's not something that's going to kill you.  I mean, not doing it could kill you.  It doesn't hurt.  That's okay.  I've been shagged.  It's unpleasant.  The fact that you balked and said, what guest?  Like that means that a finger is going in your ass. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, he's interested.  It means he's thinking about it.  Yeah, if you were going, no, because if it was me, I'd be just going, this isn't going  to happen, guys.  No matter what, this isn't going to happen.  Yeah.  The fact that he already said, well, what guest simply means there is a finger going to be  in his asshole.  I'm going to have to look at the list.  How about this?  If we give Roland, if he does it, we allow him to book, say, any two guests.  Yeah, we'll go two.  Like the two guests, you can just tell us what day. 
[02:58:00]  We would like to have a certain day lined up.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We have no choice.  We will not have to clear them with us.  I think Roland's scared that he's going to make cumzies in his pants.  Oh, jeez.  Paul's all shy.  I think it would be really funny to have the guest, you book the guest, and then we  have to explain why they're on our show.  We don't even know who they are.  Dude, we're never told who they are.  Yeah, all right.  Roland just brings them in and sits them down, and then we have to tell them why they're in 
[02:58:30]  here and do the interview.  Off the cuff.  And I want to go to Pat Duffy.  Now, talk to Roland.  Pat Duffy really had a finger up his ass last time Dr. Steve was in town because it's  Dr. Steve's thing.  He's very gentle.  It's my thing.  He's very gentle.  Very gentle.  Thank you.  And it's good to know.  I mean, you might as well just get it done so at least you know that you're healthy and  you don't have anything.  And it was awkward, right?  It was a little awkward.  I don't want to lie to Roland.  It was awkward.  But no one saw his ass or anything.  Even Dr. Steve didn't see.  He was kind of just feeling around and kind of... 
[02:59:00]  Did you take my daughter's shit to the doctor?  It's in root right now.  Okay.  The leavings.  The leavings, yes.  Dr. Steve is actually...  It is what he does with the prostate.  Like, he's actually been known with patients to say, you should have your prostate checked.  And when they say no, he goes, come on, please.  He loves this.  He loves this.  And Dr. Steve, you should have came here yesterday.  We had hot girls.  They had asshole gaping going on in the studio yesterday.  And you could have checked them out for all sorts of things.  We were very disappointed that we...  Missed that one? 
[02:59:30]  Missed that one.  You know, you check them all and then laugh as you tell them they don't have a prostate.  It would have been very, very funny.  Well, you're treating me of prostate cancer.  Just like every female of every species on Earth.  All right, Roland.  However, the bad news is you've just been fingered in the ass.  But it's still a good idea to eliminate it.  What's going on with Roland?  While I cum on my pants.  All you'll have to do is tell us when the guests are coming in so we can block the time.  Yeah.  You don't have to say who they are. 
[03:00:00]  Two guests of your choice.  Or just tell us off Friday at 8 or whatever.  Pick it.  It could be anyone.  Is that worth a finger in the ass?  Why not?  He needs to do that for work.  And there's also a couple of favors he could probably call in.  And it's legit.  Yeah.  And it's not going to hurt you.  We'll do a fine interview.  And Roland, you've listened to the show before.  Yeah.  So you know what's going to happen.  Yeah.  I don't see you getting out of this.  People pay for this.  The only thing I...  Insurance companies pay people to have this done.  It's something...  We're giving you a prize. 
[03:00:30]  I know.  This is going to happen to you.  I mean, at some point in your adult life, this is going to happen to you.  Right, right.  But I feel okay.  Yeah, but he's right.  At some point, whether it's now, whether it's at 30, 40, 50 years old, at some point,  you will have this done.  So you might as well...  What are you putting it off for?  I don't know.  And you always remember...  For bad news.  Your first time.  You always remember your first time.  It's a big fear of menace, prostate cancer.  And the bad news is scary, but I just got a test, and then I had a fucking sonogram 
[03:01:00]  done where they had to look at my prostate and everything, and they said it was healthy,  and I was surprised.  I didn't think it was, so I feel completely relieved.  Over-fucking-worked.  Yeah.  I feel pretty good.  Take good dumps.  Yeah, but Dr. Steve's got a big dump.  He's got the glove and everything.  He's ready to go.  Prostate cancer doesn't...  You don't go like, ooh, I feel prostate cancer-y.  Yeah.  It just happens to your body, and it kills you.  That's true.  It eats you asshole and dick first.  True.  And then you die a year later. 
[03:01:30]  Boy, you should put that on a PSA.  Prostate cancer is very serious.  It eats you asshole and dick first.  Ooh, gotta get checked.  Then it has dessert on your balls.  Scott M. from HopHog writes, don't negotiate.  Just tell Roland to open up his butt cheeks Friday-wide.  You would be, let me be, a little reality here.  Let's say, God forbid, you have prostate cancer.  It usually winds up spreading to other organs, your hips, your bones. 
[03:02:00]  Once it gets in there, you're done.  Now, if you're laying in the cancer ward, your terminal, they've told you you just have months  to live, you would probably think, I'm being honest with you, God, I wish I would have  had that done, and I could have avoided this.  You would be saying that, wouldn't you?  It's like if someone smokes and they have lung cancer, you would say, like, God, I wish I 
[03:02:30]  would have stopped smoking.  I got a better reason.  And do you have, how much, Dr. Steve, how much does sticking, how much do you charge  people to stick your finger up their ass?  Well, for a complete physical, it's about anywhere from $150 to $250.  So, see, so you're making money.  Yeah.  You're saving that.  It's like, I have full medical.  I have full medical.  Dental.  Dental.  Eyes.  Dental.  Eyes, yeah, you got two of those.  Come on, Roland.  It's behind the couch.  No one will see.  Yeah.  It's good for you. 
[03:03:00]  Except for Peltac.  No, no, no, no.  There won't be any.  No one's going to see your butt or anything.  It'll just be your face.  Yeah, let's get them robed.  Yeah, there'll be a robe, so it's easy access, and no one sees anything.  The fact that you're standing here talking about it means you're going to take a finger  in the ass today.  Let's just get this done.  Yeah, because it's going to happen.  Because you are curious, probably, because you know it's something you're going to have  to get done anyway, medically.  Even if not for the radio show.  Oh, so everybody loves the limelight.  Medically, it's like, for me, it's like, a little bit of it.  That's mostly for the guests. 
[03:03:30]  Everybody wants to be a star.  Don't you want to be a star today?  Yeah.  This is a great big shiny star.  This will be very professional, too.  This is like a stripper.  Go behind the couch.  He's never going to do it, because he knows that we're going to keep asking.  He's making 20 bucks a dance making us ask.  We'll make him pay if he doesn't do it.  We'll make him pay if he doesn't do it.  Yes.  I was the thing.  You need to move from bribery to blackmail pretty soon.  We'll start saying no a lot more than we do now.  Trust me.  Look at that.  There's another side to this.  Hope's going right to the nasty, nasty part. 
[03:04:00]  Okay, let's just keep it as two guests.  Two guests.  Okay, and then.  Of your choosing.  We'll be good guests, too.  They won't.  We have no choice.  So he's going to do it, then.  Hold on.  Let me interrupt real quick.  You guys out there, you can do the paperwork on the commercial.  You don't have to do it now.  They're enjoying.  You guys, you can fill out the paperwork on the commercial.  Yeah, the whole reason you're here is to watch Roland Gibson.  Yeah, you don't have to fill it out now.  The fact that that was just handed to you in the middle of the show is really irritating.  You relax.  Enjoy yourself. 
[03:04:30]  You can do it on the commercial.  There's no rush to fill stuff out.  Can I get three guests, and we'll do it now?  Okay.  I say yes.  Three guests over a period of.  Oh, no, no.  No, but they'll be all.  They'll all be named guests at show.  We'll all know.  He's playing us.  No, no.  No, he said three right now.  I say he's playing us.  No.  I say three right now.  But now, wait a minute.  We can't have three guests in like a week.  No, no, no.  It's got to be spread over.  Four months.  How long?  Four or five months.  Three guests of his choosing.  Hold on.  But we said two.  You're going to three. 
[03:05:00]  So now we.  This is a bargaining thing.  Now he checks you for a hernia, too.  What is it?  That's hernia.  Fair enough.  He's probably more likely to have a hernia than prostate cancer.  Oh.  So he's going to like grab your ball and then you have to cough.  It don't hurt at all.  It don't hurt at all.  And then we're talking three guests.  See, that's what I do now.  So now you get the hernia check and the finger up the ass.  All right.  All professional, by the way.  Is that the robe?  That's a towel.  What happened to that big robe?  It's fine.  My pants are sagging.  A what?  All right.  I wouldn't use that towel.  We were using that yesterday to wipe girls' asses. 
[03:05:30]  No, you don't need that.  That's all right.  If you have a tissue, he's fine.  All right.  Get the pal talk camera.  No, it's just for your face.  Just for the reaction.  Relax.  No one's going to film anything embarrassing.  And we're doing this because it's Dr. Steve and it's his thing.  I use vanilla soap up there, so it's clean.  Fair enough.  I'm sure it is.  Thank you.  By the way, Dr. Steve's not thrilled that he has to do this.  I'm pretty sure he's not.  But it's okay.  But he's professional.  You know, in all seriousness, prostate cancer is rare in people Roland's age. 
[03:06:00]  Testicular cancer is a young man's disease, and every young man should be checking his  nuts on a monthly basis.  So if I can just get that out, then I at least feel like I've said something professional,  and then now we can go stick a finger up Roland's butt.  And you can check him for testicular cancer too, correct?  Absolutely.  That's a fucking doozy.  That's a biggie, Roland.  I thought I had it because I had like a lump, but I had Dr. Feel it.  He goes, no, it's part of like the bandage.  That's how you and I met.  Aw.  What do you think about the lump on your neck?  It was in a rest area, which was so odd. 
[03:06:30]  Through a glory hole.  Is that how we met?  Was that our first chat was about that?  Yep, sure was.  No, I had an operation with a kid because there was no circulation on my left leg.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Now the confessions come out.  Oh, boy.  What do you mean, no circulation?  Here, move the mic over to behind the couch so Roland can get comfortable.  Roland, you can just hold the microphone, I guess, so no one's near you.  That's right.  Yeah, we want to hear the...  Yeah, block him in there. 
[03:07:00]  I don't want to thank you.  And Dr. Steve gets the mic.  Okay.  Yeah, Dr. Steve's got a mic.  Dr. Steve's putting the glove on.  You know, because this is what he requested from the show when he comes to New York.  He says, hey, you know, my thing is to stick fingers up.  He's double-gloving it.  Right here.  Two gloves.  I love the fact that the people he's with, they're pulling out cameras and everything.  You've heard of a Tennessee two-bagger.  A Tennessee two-bagger.  Please make this your Christmas wine.  He's doing two gloves. 
[03:07:30]  Roland, and we swear there's no pal talk on your ass.  No, no.  If there is, it's there.  No, it's not.  But you do have to all stay clear of his face.  It so barely matters that this guy's a doctor.  Oh, I know.  We really could have been let this audience member stick a finger in his ass.  Oh, I know.  It wouldn't be that different.  I do want to acknowledge that Roland didn't really fight this one at all, by the way.  No, he didn't.  Okay, good.  This was going to happen.  He went from no to, well, how many guests?  Within like ten seconds. 
[03:08:00]  There's movies coming up.  So, Roland is doing this so he can book three guests that we would usually say no to.  This is a good booker.  This is a really good booker.  All right.  What do we got, Steve?  I'm ready.  Steve, you've got to talk us through.  Okay.  So, the first thing you have to do, my friend, is assume the position, which is to put your  elbows on the...  I do.  Now, put your...  He's already breathing heavy from anxiety.  Put your face forward.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because this is that.  And don't move your head around too much.  I'm trying not to.  Because this is the view we want. 
[03:08:30]  I'm getting upset.  Wait, can I see the view on one of these cameras?  All right, hold on.  I want to enjoy the PalTalk view.  Hold on, Steve.  Hold on, Steve.  And I just added my PalTalk thing.  All right, hold on a minute.  Oh, man.  Can we think up a different bit for me when I come...  Yeah, yeah, right?  Can we be creative?  God forbid you check if it's breast cancer.  You want...  All right, there's Roland's face.  All right, good.  Is that a good shot of Roland, you think?  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  You can see the lines on his forehead and...  Yeah, that's what we want. 
[03:09:00]  Just keep your chin up.  Yeah, keep your chin up.  Let's really rain a roller coaster.  Yeah, don't show us the top of your head.  All right, this is...  We love getting the reaction shot.  All right, Dr. Steve.  If you can't see the camera while you're getting a finger up your ass,  the camera can't see you riding a finger up your ass.  All right.  Remember that.  Are you doing the testicle first?  All right, he's lubing up now.  And there it goes.  It's going in.  It's going in.  Watch that face.  It's going in right now.  Oh!  Stay out of the way!  Here we go.  Are you ready?  Oh, it looks like a...  One eye!  One eye!  He's turning into pops. 
[03:09:30]  Roland, how is it?  It's like a buddy hacket.  Roland?  Perfect.  Absolutely normal.  Ooh.  How was that?  Roland?  It was the most awkward thing ever.  I'm going to go home and take a shower.  His ass is a little big, so I can only get in about one knuckle.  Oh, wow.  But it was enough.  And I've got long fingers.  But it was enough to feel you've got a totally normal prostate.  All right.  All right.  Let's do the testicular exam.  All right.  Let's move on to the bowl. 
[03:10:00]  Doctors are fucking amazing.  I don't get it.  This one's the serious one.  Oh, Roland.  All right.  I think there's a big ballast.  I'm scared.  Find the camera.  Find your camera.  There you go.  There it is.  Turn your head and cough.  There you go.  We've got to see that face.  Which side did you have surgery on?  The left.  The left?  Okay.  Look at that fucking grimace.  That grimace.  Totally normal.  You're okay, man.  All right.  There you go.  Boom.  Boom.  What if he said you have cancer in your balls? 
[03:10:30]  We'd all laugh.  We'd all be like, ah, cancer.  Line of the day.  You're going to die of ball cancer, you fag.  Wouldn't that be ironic if he got hit by a bus and killed when he left here?  You wouldn't even have to.  A man with perfectly normal balls and anus was killed today.  No, the coroner finds grease in his asshole and he thinks it was a lover's quarrel.  Sam.  Rolling?  Yes.  Jimsy.  That's right.  They found lubrication in his buttocks, Sam.  This was a lover's quarrel. 
[03:11:00]  Well, Quince, I don't think there was anything to indicate that.  He's a fat man with a greasy ass, Sam.  It was lubricant.  It was lubricant.  It was lubricated.  It was murder.  Jimsy.  That's right.  He had a juicy, delicious ass, Sam.  Unlike that girl on my boat whose ass is flat.  Like a pancake. 
[03:11:30]  Give me my members only, Jack.  I'm going to get throat cancer, Sam.  Rolling?  Yeah.  Feeling a little squishy back there?  Yeah, a little squishy.  Yeah, a little gushy.  You might want to go into the bathroom and cry.  How was it when we went in?  Wipe it out.  It was all right.  I was like, I'm about to take a dump and then that's like, hey, come in here.  That was awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The gel inside.  So what guess are you thinking?  I don't know.  But they'll be a good guess. 
[03:12:00]  There's a guess that you might not think of.  Like, oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't kill us too much.  No, no, no.  See, I think you should renege on the thing.  He can't sue you.  Here's what this nice guy Louie wrote down.  When he's done, you should say no to the guest and fuck you.  Too bad.  Sue us.  He couldn't actually sue you.  Just go, thanks for the finger in the ass.  No.  No to your shit guests.  Take your guests and walk.  Business as usual, you fucking dummy. 
[03:12:30]  Hit the bricks, greasy ass.  Someone wants to know if you use the same glove because now they're thinking we're all  in that shit bag.  No, that's why I double gloved.  I took the one glove off.  Yeah, yeah.  The lube was Juicy Lube Wild Cherry brought to us by MySexyStore.com.  All right.  Wow.  Definitely.  I smell cherry scent.  That's not a natural scent for a Mexican.  Dr. Steve's bid is sponsored.  That's terrific. 
[03:13:00]  Because it's your thing.  It's your thing, Dr. Steve.  Thank you.  We'll try to come up with something for the next time.  Derek in New Hampshire or Indiana.  What's up?  You made a man take a finger up the ass to benefit your radio show.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Of course.  What do you do for a living, asshole?  All right.  Puddle of Aids from Jersey writes, remember yesterday there was beautiful young girls gaping their  asses?  Yeah.  Now this nervous fat boy's asshole and balls are being groped. 
[03:13:30]  What happened, guys?  You can't keep up the pace.  It is true.  This show is all over the place.  It's a bit of a seesaw.  It's okay.  That's fine.  Ebb and flow.  Hey, Dr. Steve, the big promote for the show tomorrow night.  What are you going to do?  Well, we've got a bunch of topics that we're going to discuss and callers calling in with  their medical problems.  And they always tend to be things that they wouldn't ask the regular doctor but have no 
[03:14:00]  problem talking about anonymously on a national radio show.  And it's called Weird Medicine, 9 o'clock Eastern on XM202, the Saturday Night Virus.  How long is it, Steve, the show?  Three hours this time.  Oh, good, man.  The response last time was really so overwhelming that Danny said we've got to do three hours  this time.  It went too quickly last time is what happened.  It went amazingly quickly.  Dr. Steve has a way, because I've talked to him many times on the telephone, a great  way of making you feel comfortable and relaxed. 
[03:14:30]  You're really good.  You have a great way, just as a physician, because I'm a nervous wreck.  But even if you're not sure what's wrong with you, he still has a great way of kind of  talking you through it.  You're like, all right, I'll fucking live through this.  I'll live through this.  And usually you're okay, but...  Yeah.  And what does a pimple on your dick mean?  Like a pimple, like a white head.  Would you stop feeding your dick chocolate?  I can't beat that line.  Is it bad?  Oh, no.  Not necessarily, if it really is a pimple.  It's not me.  I was blowing my dad, and he had a pimple on his dick.  So I just want to know if I should worry about old dads. 
[03:15:00]  That sounds perfectly normal.  Okay.  Good.  Do you know I have a discoloration on my penis?  You want to show Dr. Steve?  No.  Behind the couch, man?  No.  It's like on the head.  It's a purplish color.  It looks like somebody pinched it and went, bad boy.  And it hurts.  It doesn't hurt.  It's just a weird purple discoloration.  It's like a burst blood vessel or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  You know, I would have to see that.  But people just aren't perfectly shaded all over their body, and you'll have places that 
[03:15:30]  just develop that one.  How long could it have been an old trauma?  Years.  It could have been a lot of different things.  It looks like the Virgin Mary.  Is that weird?  I've had girls ask me about it, though, because they don't know what it is.  Ah, yeah, they don't like seeing anything weird on a dick.  Yeah, they wear a nice, clean, white slate.  That's it.  Or shiny black.  Capillaries called a Hershey bar.  Hold on, a collection of capillaries, what?  Called a hemangioma.  It could be a lot of different things.  What's the hemangioma from, though?  It's just, it's a, you've seen those little pink spots on people's skin, same thing. 
[03:16:00]  It's just a, you know, the body is just a very complicated thing, and sometimes, you  know, especially on our skin, it's one of our most complicated organs, you'll just have  things show up, and they really don't mean anything.  It'd be funny if you looked at my penis, and you said it means.  Like to show, we show up, and it doesn't mean anything.  That, however, is going to explode in 15 minutes.  It means my cock is rotting like a carcass.  And the tip is going to fall off my knees for that. 
[03:16:30]  Your cock is going to fucking become an undead, and it's going to kill you.  A zombie cock.  Yeah.  A zombie cock.  I wake up, and it's holding a razor, just cutting my fat little belly.  Why?  Why?  Sam, this was murder.  All right, Dr. Steve, tomorrow night?  Yes, tomorrow night.  Thank you, my friends.  What time?  Nine o'clock?  Yeah, nine o'clock.  Nine o'clock.  Nine to midnight.  Nine to midnight.  It is very entertaining.  A lot of callers call, and the phones are jammed.  Excellent use of a degree in education. 
[03:17:00]  People love that.  Yeah, exactly.  Beautiful application.  And it's really sad that he does get information out there.  Oh, yeah, he does.  I almost find that sad, that he helps people on this goddamn channel.  The tip of his penis was purple, Sam.  Love it.  Thank you, guys.  Love the gymsi.  That's all I think of.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  I hated that show when I was a kid, because I loved The Odd Couple, and I didn't understand  yet that an actor could just go over it.  And I used to watch Quincy, and it'd be like, be messy. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Where's being messy?  Be funny, and Oscar Madison-like.  Eat a big sandwich, and let it fall on the floor.  Wipe your hands on the curtains.  Where's your bathrobe?  Yeah, it was a whole new character, and he was all serious.  And he talked about issues.  I hated that.  I remember he found the botulism in the stadium sink.  Does anybody remember that one?  No.  How do we not have any clips of dramatic Quincy moments?  Yeah, we need dramatic Quincy moments, because it was such drama. 
[03:18:00]  And it was the only stupid coroner that was directly involved with the crimes.  There'd be gunfire, and there's Quincy ducking behind a car, throwing people's organs out  at him, decomposing kidneys.  Solving crimes.  Yeah, he's like solving the crime.  One-man show.  That fucking creepy Asian Sam, always lurking around the genitals of whatever dead things  Quincy was working on.  He always walked in, and Sam always would lift his jet-black hairdo out of the lap of something  dead. 
[03:18:30]  Well, Quincy, I thought I dropped my contact lens.  You're practicing cunnilingus.  That's right.  On a corpse.  That's necrophilia, Sam.  Oral necrophilia.  That's not a silent nod of a yes.  They're dead.  All right, we need more Quincy clips.  Yeah, we love Quincy.  We're going to do the weigh-in for the biggest gainer contest, but first we have this fine  piece of audio.  Next, you're going to store it up. 
[03:19:00]  Store it up so good.  Skin make false.  My jello's falling down.  My jello's falling down.  I love that clip already.  Excuse me, folks.  My jello's falling down.  What the hell?  You stupid.  All right.  Well, it's good old Merrill.  We've played Merrill clips before.  It's the retard hosting a cooking show, part three.  It's a retarded person hosting a cooking show. 
[03:19:30]  Yes.  It's Merrill, everybody.  They can do anything.  They're handy capable, is what I like to say.  My jello's falling down.  Excuse me.  My soul's going to be stirring up the jello here.  I'm trying, folks.  My jello's not doing that great.  It's dying in the audience.  It's because your brain doesn't work and your face is pushed in.  It's what the doctor said during the sonogram.  Your jello's not doing well. 
[03:20:00]  You might want to remove this.  You might want to.  This is dark.  This jello's just going to be.  My jello's falling down, folks.  Here.  I don't have on my pippet-pippet-polls, folks.  I don't what?  I don't think. 
[03:20:30]  What?  It's a galloping dumbbell.  Oh, man.  He just wants his jello to come out right.  Julia should have aborted that child.  Oh, God.  No, it's fully a child.  Fully a child.  And by jello, he means IQ.  Halitosis kid from Baltimore.  Yes.  More from Merrill.  Merrill finally shows you the final finished product of his jello. 
[03:21:00]  Welcome back to the Merrill Howard Kalen Show.  We just came back from the microwave.  Sounds like Pee Wee Herman.  Cooked a marvelous chicken and stuffing.  You forgot what you cooked, you asshole.  Let's see how it came out.  His hands are red from touching it without gloves.  Licking good chicken.  And look at that. 
[03:21:30]  And stuffing.  Oh, who's eating that?  Oh, jeez.  Thing is, he's using a shove-up-his-nose-mouth asshole.  He's got a feather sticking out of it.  It's still half alive.  Fucking dumb Merrill.  He just took a chicken and took it by his feet, smashed his head, and cooked it.  Just go work in the box factory, retarded man.  Quit dreaming.  It's just depressing everybody.  It's a special snot recipe.  Oh, God.  Nobody wants your fucking salmonella chicken. 
[03:22:00]  I'm going to fucking eat that.  Bringing down the human curve, you asshole.  Go fucking cook meth in a tub.  Spoiling her average intelligence, you cunt.  Exactly.  Roll that around in your mouth.  Fucking hilarious.  Oh, man, here's some chicken.  Chicken.  Fucking bunch of grasshoppers in a bowl. 
[03:22:30]  They're still alive.  Put fucking baby powder on it and vinegar.  He just punches them in his fist.  That's the idea of cooking them.  Good chicken.  Let's find out more about Merrill.  People in the audience, people anywhere, do not cook alone.  Have your mom or dad or your brothers or your family, be there when you're cooking.  That's hilarious.  Excuse me, folks.  My Jell-O falling apart. 
[03:23:00]  You need your mother to tell you not to pee-pee in the Jell-O.  Because you will forget because you're all retarded like me.  Everyone's retarded.  Don't cook alone.  And don't put your tongue in these tempting things.  That's a socket.  Oh, God.  You know, let's go to the phones.  It's Mike in Cleveland.  Hello, Mike. 
[03:23:30]  How about cooking with big tongues and drool your child?  There he is.  Very nice.  Chris in Virginia.  Hey, Chris.  Iron Helmet Chef, America.  Iron Helmet Chef.  Let's go to Carl in Utah.  Carl.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  You guys rule.  Hey, I just had an epiphany.  I think you guys need to come up with the beep game for Merrill.  You think this might work?  I don't know.  I already came up with the beep game. 
[03:24:00]  All intelligent thoughts.  Boop.  All right.  El Gano.  Let's try Mark in Philly.  Mark.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You should be named Martha Stupid.  That's pretty good.  That's not a bad one.  Excuse me, folks.  My Jell-O falling apart.  Enough about your Jell-O.  Excuse me.  Jimmy, you think this Merrill kid likes to cook?  I don't think he likes to cook.  This Merrill LOVES it!  Loves it, right?  But he probably doesn't have any heat on. 
[03:24:30]  No.  They don't cook the stove in because he might kill himself and everybody in the neighborhood.  It's a cardboard box.  He's got a pot on top of it.  It's a Susie Bake Coven.  Fuck it.  Puts a rock in instead of rocks.  Susie Bake Coven.  Isn't it an easy Bake Coven?  Whatever.  Fucking Susie.  Susie in there.  Susie Bake Coven.  What about Jell-O?  What?  Does he like the Jell-O?  Merrill?  He loves it!  He lives for it.  He won't shut up about it.  This show is going to be good.  Listen to me, people out there in the audience. 
[03:25:00]  No.  No.  And anywhere else in the whole world, do not cook alone.  Be with your mom and dad or your family because they will have to teach you the way to cook.  No, they don't.  Do not use a knife for anything.  That's only you.  Just watch Merrill put dressing on your salad.  Don't use a knife for anything.  Oh, Jesus.  So good.  Oh, what was that sound? 
[03:25:30]  That's the sound.  Don't give me advice.  My brain works properly, you asshole.  Yeah, I could use a fucking knife.  I'm using all my synapses.  I'm like, you're using 12 of them.  You fucking useless asshole.  Fucking, you think everyone's retarded?  What the?  Don't use a knife.  Well, can we use a yummy sound?  For anything.  Anything.  All right.  Steve from Bayshore writes, oh, God, a pinch of extra gross.  Where is that fucking track?  That's right. 
[03:26:00]  You take a bowl and you fill it with disappointment and you stir it up with embarrassment.  Get the mixing bowl, put it on your head and cut around with scissors for a hairdo that  we all have.  Do not use a knife for anything.  Just watch me or put dressing on your salad.  Fucking. 
[03:26:30]  So good.  What was that?  Sounds appetizing.  Yeah.  Damn bronze medal winner.  Fucking.  All right.  Once again, we attack the tough targets.  I know.  We really are brave here on this show.  Look out, world.  I'm better than that guy.  Ha ha.  We were lucky enough to be normal.  Yeah.  Well, why do we have to put it that way? 
[03:27:00]  Why can't we just make fun of retarded people?  Right.  Yeah.  Who's to say what's normal?  Guilt free.  Maybe he's normal.  Right.  Fuck him.  He's ignorance is bliss, I say.  This guy is happy as a pig in shit.  You don't know.  Well, the day he shot this, he was.  You guys are all tripping over each other.  I know.  The day he shot that video, he was happy.  Could have been as soon as there was a wrap, he was like, I'm getting tired.  I don't want to do it anymore.  I'm sick of the cooking. 
[03:27:30]  But everyone loves it.  You bring happiness and joy and inspiration.  Hey!  I want to masturbate again.  No, don't.  I want to masturbate and poop at the same time.  That is kind of a stereotype they have.  They're just jerking off all the time.  I don't know if it's accurate or not.  Simon from Virginia writes, did you find the show on not enough oxygen in the womb network?  Not enough oxygen.  Yeah, here we go. 
[03:28:00]  More of Merrill.  Ready, set.  Merrill's going to do some impressions.  Ready, set, be retarded.  No.  His show is on HB.  Oh.  Oh.  That's his parents' reaction.  Oh.  Just playing it.  Merrill wants to do some impressions for everybody.  And I want to tell you something.  The one of the invitations I want to do before we leave tonight is...  Wreck-Hail-Welch. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Ba-da-dum.  Well, hi, everybody.  I'm it.  I'm Wreck-Hail-Welch.  Yeah.  That's just what she sounded like.  This show is almost over.  Hip, hip, great to be.  Well, you know, Gracie's going to be here is my all-time favorite.  It's Jack Benny.

[03:29:30]  I'm Pocky Pig.  That's Merrill.  Alfred, your father should have pulled out his cock.  Yeah, that's just what Porky Pig did. 
[03:30:00]  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  That's just what Porky Pig did.  Yeah.  He just stood in that circle and just went...  Did he even get to the punchline of that?  He didn't even say that's all, folks.  No.  He just blathered on like, oh, like a retard or something.  As if one would almost think that the fellow was retarded. 
[03:30:30]  If I didn't know better, I'd say that fellow had Down syndrome.  Fucking old stegosaurus brain.  Fucking brain of a leaf eater.  Fucking old stegosaurus brain.  Fucking old stegosaurus brain.  Fucking old stegosaurus brain.  Fucking old stegosaurus brain.  Fucking old stegosaurus brain.  Hey, there's more?  One more.  Come on.  Great.  Next week's show, we're going to be doing a scene from Motorola.  What? 
[03:31:00]  Motorola.  What?  Motorola.  The show's going to call the topic is the life of Motorola from Merrill Howard Kalin.  What he does at Motorola.  He's going to spend the whole day there.  What the fuck?  The show's going to be interviewing my friends, my boss, the people who are my best friends,  who's not my best friends. 
[03:31:30]  We're going to introduce everybody.  No one's your best friend.  No.  It means everybody.  If you were a lie.  If you were an Eskimo, they would have left you for the fucking Bears asshole.  All my everybody.  You're fucking...  The show's going to be fun, mate.  There's going to be invitations.  There's going to be a lot of those guest stars, guest hosts.  No, there's not.  Exactly.  No one's coming.  Exactly.  And that's it, folks.  Yeah, that is it.  Thanks for coming to the Merrill Howard Kalin Show. 
[03:32:00]  With the forehead up, it's a great impression of Pete Rose and Moe Howard.  We got Matt from Queensbury.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Who is that, Chef Boyard and our family photos ruined?  Chef Boyard.  Come on.  Jimmy, I'll see you in Albany.  Thank you.  All right.  Watch it out.  Oh, the kid.  He would have been put out on a float if he was a fucking Eskimo.  They would have...  Put him on an ice float?  Put him on an ice float and let the fucking...  Let the whatever's get him.  Polar bears, right? 
[03:32:30]  He would have been naturally selected.  Killer whale?  They wouldn't have eaten him, though.  They would have sensed that something was wrong.  Like the way you smell a piece of bad sushi.  Yep.  Wolfgang Suck.  He was a fucking...  Wolfgang Suck.  No, Wolfgang Cluck.  He's dope.  Let's go to a...  He was a fucking Sioux Indian in the 1700s.  They would have kicked him to death.  Should have been the end of him.  Prayed to their gods never to send another.  This one doesn't work.  This one doesn't work.  This one broken.  This is one brain broken.  This one heaped broken. 
[03:33:00]  This one heaped broken.  This one heaped broken.  Brain broken.  This one stinks.  This one stinks.  It was a simpler time.  Yeah.  Brain broken.  Brain broken.  Kick him to death.  Must kick to death.  Must kick to death.  They scalped him and used his dumb hair as a throw rug.  Keep fucking retarded Indians around.  Mike A.  They knew something was wrong when they gave him moccasins and he ate them. 
[03:33:30]  They're like, he has to go.  He's...  This is not gonna be helpful.  Mike A.  Hey.  Hey.  Me?  Yes, sir.  Hey, shouldn't this retard being a blimp tossing out fucking water balloons?  Oh, that doesn't...  That's hurtful.  That's...  That's hurtful.  I don't even understand that one.  Yeah, we did a bit 12 years ago that was really bad.  I listened to it just the other day for the first time in 12 years and we're very embarrassed.  Yes.  Biggest gator time.  Let's get the weigh-ins going.  Okay, we need a scare. 
[03:34:00]  Louis, we got guys just pigging out and trying to gain as much weight in the next three months.  Oh God, really?  Going against all those fucking shows that are trying to get America out of health.  Who's doing it with people on your show?  Well, obviously not Sam.  We got Butcher.  We got, uh...  Oh.  Where's Bronx Johnny's music?  Bronx Johnny.  Bronx Johnny.  The lovely Lily.  Oh my God.  The cute girls doing it?  Yeah, the lovely Lily.  Why doesn't it make her fat?  I don't want to make her fat.  So no one wants her.  Wait, wait, hold on.  Why isn't her mic gone?  Why would that work?  Ron and Fez Nuna 3.  Thank you.  Ah, there's the plug. 
[03:34:30]  Got that for us.  Dave, you are looking good, man.  You are looking good.  Let me...  Congratulations!  You guys have officially destroyed my fucking life.  You won!  Ron and Fez Nuna 3.  0 and A 6 to 12.  You guys won.  I have nothing anymore.  I'm like a grown up version of Chunk from fucking Goonies.  You really have gone to shit.  Did he not look like this always?  No, no.  He was a slim guy.  I was 195 when I started this whole fucking debacle.  He was a slim guy.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God. 
[03:35:00]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  On Ron and Fez's show, he winds up getting married.  Now he's expecting a child with his new bride.  Oh my God.  And he's turning into what looks like the typical fucking piece of shit father.  That's really bad.  Look, he's got a wife beater on.  You can see his belly button and tits through it.  That's really bad.  His awful white man tattoos.  How much does he...  I want to know how much he weighs.  Whack bag.  Yeah, whack bag tattoos.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  My whole life is going...  Spiraling down.  Yeah, look at your belly.  Your gut.  Abuse and overheating.  Oh yeah.  He's a ridiculous alcoholic too.  Wow.  Financial issues.  Thanks, Don.  Anyway.  You look like you're going to beat your wife at some point during your marriage.  Yeah.  I'm there.  I'm ready to snap.  I'm snapping at homeless people all the time.  I see you dressed just like that with the cops like wrestling you down and you drunk  arguing with them to get the fuck out of my house.  It's my house. 
[03:36:00]  It's my house.  I got rights in my house.  And they start spewing like what they think their rights are.  I got the right to hit my wife in my house.  It's like, no.  You don't.  And the immediate turn from defiance to, okay, okay, no, don't.  All right.  Yeah.  Right when the fucking taser hits him with a mace in the face.  Okay.  Okay.  My eyes are burning.  Baby, I'm sorry, honey.  I'm sorry, sweetheart.  I'm sorry, sweetheart.  Bail me out.  Bail me out, baby.  The constant feeling of having this shit. 
[03:36:30]  If Dr. Steve had given me the prostate, there would have been poop on his finger.  Really?  Just from all the overeating.  You're just eating too much.  It's ridiculous.  You're really taking this to heart, literally.  I get all in.  That's my problem.  That's my problem.  Hey!  This is great.  All in.  Once he got married, I saw, like, this spiral.  Oh, man.  Like, you were a pretty wild, single guy where you're out drinking all the time.  Yeah.  But you kind of, at least you kept yourself in some kind of shape. 
[03:37:00]  Right, yeah.  Now you've just given up.  I've just destroyed myself.  Yeah.  Wow.  Due to the radio business.  Wow.  All right, who's going to weigh in first?  I think we saved Dave for a little later.  Yeah.  Let's go with Lily.  I'm first.  How are you?  I'm doing well.  She's a very slender, pretty girl.  She's got 5'9".  What do you think the Giants' chances are of winning the Super Bowl?  I haven't, I don't know.  I haven't weighed myself in like...  No, no.  What do you think the Giants' chances are of winning the Super Bowl?  But that's good not to be a narcissist. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, the chances.  Oh, the Giants.  I heard of, there was a bet made yesterday.  A lot of people were talking about this bet that went down on Ron and Fez yesterday.  What was that about?  See, well, my girlfriend was in the studio with Ron and Fez yesterday, and a bet was made  that if the Giants win against the Patriots, Lily comes over and spends the night over  our house.  It's true.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, that's the deal they cut.  She spends the night over your house?  Yeah, but the Giants have to fucking win.  Like, I should be in a car right now just driving up to pull a fucking Nancy Kerrigan on Tom Brady. 
[03:38:00]  Because you want her to see her in her jammies.  Bash her.  Yeah, yeah.  Or out of them.  Whatever, yeah.  Out, in, it doesn't matter.  I got cameras everywhere.  I lost weight.  You lost weight?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought you were taking this seriously.  I was, but you know what?  I'm having womenly troubles this week.  Uh-oh.  Where is?  So I tend to not eat when I...  Yuck.  When you're having your period, you call it womenly troubles? 
[03:38:30]  Yes.  Womenly troubles.  How old are you?  Womenly troubles.  That's what the Irish called the fucking terrorism.  Someone?  The troubles.  The troubles.  The troubles.  She's having womanly troubles.  Yeah.  I remember the times of the troubles.  That's right.  Yes.  This is my unclean week.  So I tend to eat more.  The curse.  So don't the women eat a lot usually when they're having them? 
[03:39:00]  Well, before.  Before to get ready for it.  Like, I will tear my house apart looking for food.  And then they bloat.  Yeah.  Before I get my period.  Yeah.  But once I have it, I have like absolutely no appetite.  Right.  And she gets it pretty bad because those boots were white when she put them on this morning.  Thank you.  I'm winding down now.  She has red boots, people.  Red boots.  Thank you.  So what was the wet?  I was 25.4.  Lily has gained white boots that were made red from blood of her vagina.  See, blood came from her vagina. 
[03:39:30]  And she, and she had white boots before.  She had white boots before.  She had white boots before.  Lance, I think it's a problem.  Something inside of her was murdered.  I'm gypsy.  Wow.  More gypsy.  More gypsy.  So what do we got there, Sam?  Lily has lost 2.2 pounds since our last weigh-in.  How much does she weigh?  And gained 1.6 from the beginning.  Wow.  She's only gained a pound and a half more or less.  More or less.  Correct. 
[03:40:00]  What's a ruling if there's a hotel fire that kills the Patriots?  Anyone?  Ruling here?  Giants win by forfeit.  What happened?  Has that ever happened in a Super Bowl?  Depends on what she wears to sleep though.  She could stay over and wear like a whole.  I think she's a panties and t-shirt too.  You don't think she'd just be fun to spend the night like a sleepover?  Excuse me.  Don't make me look shallow because I was sexualizing.  All of a sudden I'm an asshole.  Like we could all play Monopoly or something until late at night.  Um, that's cool.  Or poker or something? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, poker.  More adults.  We could play poker.  Strip poker.  I don't like the fact that Anthony's coming up with a good guy.  Like, wear flowers.  We'll play chutes and ladders.  I'm locking the door and holding her at gunpoint.  Meanwhile, he's got a toilet cam hooked up.  I know.  Someone suggested yesterday that she would just be locked in the guest room with one of my guns  and accidentally shoot me as I walked to the bathroom.  How old are you?  How old are you? 
[03:41:00]  I'm 26.  God, she's cute.  Thanks.  I like her.  Everyone loves Lily.  I'm not very married, you know.  I'm married but not really.  Oh, it's okay.  I'm in a relationship.  Okay, that's fine then.  That worked out nicely for both of you.  Way to go, Lou.  One flailing reach and one cold hard go fuck yourself.  All right, who's up next?  Let's go with Brock.  Welcome.  Brock's Johnny.  She said, see what happened.  Brock's Johnny making his way to the scale.  Yeah.  See, that's Brock's Johnny.  Yeah, Johnny, you high right now? 
[03:41:30]  I wish.  They test twice a day at my job, man.  Twice a day?  Yeah, they ain't not fucking around.  They don't trust you at all, do they?  No.  Twice a day?  That's not...  No one gets tested twice a day.  Fucking shit, you know.  That shit is crazy.  They get tested twice in a week.  What do you test for?  Fuck.  Whatever's in your system.  What are you doing?  Well, allegedly I do weed occasionally.  No, no, no, but what are you doing for work-wise?  Oh, security and shit.  Not drugs.  Allegedly and occasionally.  Security?  For what?  Uh, Marriott and...  Oh, I can't even... 
[03:42:00]  Oh, fuck him.  Marriott and, uh...  Fuck him.  Some majestic homo shit.  Cool hotel though, if you have out there.  Do you see some majestic homo shit?  I guess.  It's majestic something.  I can't pronounce.  You're like a hotel security guy.  Security guard.  Fucking...  I do janitorial shit if need be.  What are you looking for?  Yeah?  I'm looking for money, man.  No, I mean, what are you looking for when you're doing the security thing?  Like, what are you looking out for?  Oh, I gotta make sure people's packages get to them.  Nobody bugs the guests and shit.  If someone calls up and says, I need like a wire for my computer, you're the guy that 
[03:42:30]  brings it up?  Nah, I send the kids down to go...  Oh, fuck them then.  Okay.  We got...  For some reason, you can have 14-year-old Asian kids working outside and call them interns.  Oh, shit.  That sounds illegal.  Really?  The Marriott here in New York?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  A little scandal going on.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Interns.  Call them interns.  Interns that are making sneakers in the basement.  That work in a hotel.  Yeah.  That's great.  Interesting.  Alright.  How are you doing?  Oh, shit. 
[03:43:00]  How much?  Oh, boy.  Is there a dot there?  Is there a dot there?  Either way, 165 or 1650.  It said 195.  I've lost about, what, eight pounds?  You're all losing fucking weight.  What are you guys eating, AIDS?  You're wrecking our beds!  Ron and Phil.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You're bitch!  Ron and Fez are working you guys too hard. 
[03:43:30]  I don't know.  They work you too hard, except for Dave.  Dave's figured it all out.  Look at his gut hanging out of his wife's beater.  Eating pizza right now.  He's eating right now, too.  What a mess.  This Ron and Fez crew, they can't even, like, gain weight the right way.  I'm fucking trying.  I can't keep the weight on, man.  Is there anything you guys do correctly?  Oh.  Dave, you absolutely could be in one of those movies.  Yeah, but you pick people.  You pick people.  There's some people that are fat guys and waiting.  Yeah.  Like your friend Dave here.  Like, that's pretty much...  Dave is...  I can't...  If he ever looked skinny, he was just waiting to look like this. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Do you see him like...  I think this is his natural state.  I can totally see him in a movie where it's in Boston, and he's like the miserable Irish  dad who's just like fucking angry.  No, a movie.  He's like a cartoon.  Everyone hates him.  He's like a cartoon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he's a caricature.  But these other people are generally...  They look like their bodies take care of themselves.  These are people who have a self-cleaning system.  Yeah.  Lily, I don't see gaining anyway.  No, she's not going to gain any weight.  Actually, it was just a ploy to get you in here on a steady basis.  I did go to the bathroom this morning.  Oh, you did?  That is my problem. 
[03:44:30]  Nice one.  I had to.  When I wake up, I have to.  Nice one.  It's like a three pound shit then.  Yeah.  It's good.  We're going to get a plush and then tell us about it.  Then we want to send somebody in there to check it out.  Okay.  Take a picture.  I go here all the time.  Okay.  Let us know next time.  I'm serious.  And Lily now has a camera on PalTalk.  Yeah.  Somebody sent it to me.  Yeah.  Creeps.  She cammed up last night and we got to see her puppy attack her.  Aww.  He wasn't attacking.  He was biting, but he's teeting.  No, I know.  Well, you didn't have peanut butter and he's very angry with that. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  He's crazy.  What kind of dog is it?  It's a Sharpay.  Okay, cool.  That neck.  Do you think their eyes clipped and shit, right?  Yeah.  My old one I did, but this one seems to not be so wrinkled by the eyes.  It was growling and then it attacked her face.  It was really funny to watch.  Wait, wait.  Why are we clipping the eyelids?  I mean, they did fine in nature before humans had to start fucking with their eyelids.  No, their Sharpays are all fucked up from overbreeding.  Breeding.  That wasn't supposed to be in nature.  They get infections in their skin from the folds.  That's wonderful. 
[03:45:30]  They're not supposed to be so wrinkly.  People do it because they think it's cute and then they get irritated and they have  bad lives.  Look at Lou.  But nobody actually loves dogs.  They just like looking at them.  I didn't know that.  Why do you know that, Lou?  What?  Why do you know that?  Because I don't know.  I just hear shit and then I know it.  Okay.  And Lily, you were in your bedroom last night?  Yeah.  And you were wearing something.  It was very skimpy for you.  It was just a tank top.  You were usually dressed like this.  It was just a tank top.  But it had like spaghetti straps, didn't it? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, little spaghetti straps and stuff.  Little spaghetti straps.  Sure.  That's good.  It was a tank top.  Well, based on the reaction of the room, people were very happy.  I will never go on cam again.  You're never going to go on cam again.  Never.  Why?  Creep.  See, you fucking people ruin it.  They do.  Well, what did you think they were going to...  That's true.  How many Arabs were jacking off of you?  Why else would somebody want to see you on a camera so they could jerk off to you?  Yeah.  I mean, do you think they're going to pretty much this?  They want to see the expression on your face when they tell you what big Giants fans they 
[03:46:30]  are?  Like, it's not quite...  It's really weird.  I don't know.  Why don't you just want to dress like that?  You're a very sharp dresser.  You always have like a cool style.  Well, she was in like her bedroom.  It was nighttime.  It was very late.  It was getting up at like 10 o'clock or something like that.  Yeah.  And she was kind of in the bedroom.  It was kind of gym lighting.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Can PalTalk fucking get compatible with Mac already?  Yeah, they better work on that.  Enough already.  What the fuck?  Hurry up.  Assholes.  I'm sorry.  We got to get Travis Wade because he's got to get back to work for line of the day and 
[03:47:00]  stuff.  So next time Lily poops, we're going to take a look at her poop.  He's going to take his pants off.  First I have to take my pants off because Sam insists.  It's not.  Oh, Sam.  Sam.  That's right.  Louie, look at these legs.  Look at these legs.  They're good legs.  No, I don't know what these are.  Oh, Christ.  When did you get out of Auschwitz?  Jesus Christ.  Isn't that awful?  Throw him on a pile of corpses already.  Jesus.  That really is horrible.  Fucking hairy sticks.  You need to be slung into a corpse pile by an SS officer.  Holy shit. 
[03:47:30]  That's ridiculous.  Holy shit.  That's ridiculous.  I think they're nice.  Yeah.  Oh my god.  Usually legs like that are walking around the beach fighting for french fries.  Oh my god.  Did he gain a pound finally?  I gained more than a pound.  What did you gain?  I'm at 122.4.  Oh, whatever.  I think that's three pounds, right fam?  Let me just put it in my spreadsheet.  What an exciting bit we got going.  This is thrilling.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  You're now leading Lily by .8 pounds overall. 
[03:48:00]  Damn right.  All right.  They're in their own division there, Louie.  Yeah, that's the lightweight division.  Yeah.  Now we go to either Butcher or...  All right, Butcher.  Butcher is our ace in the hole.  Butcher looked like he was in shape.  For this whole time that he's been here, up until a couple of weeks ago, we thought  he was actually in shape.  Yeah.  Like he's one of those guys that looks like he's got muscles and stuff, but he was hiding  a world of hurt underneath loose t-shirts.  Dave thinks he looks like crap. 
[03:48:30]  And then when we gave him this challenge...  There you go.  When we gave him this challenge...  Wow, that's really good hiding.  Yeah, isn't it?  That's amazing.  He's got a sleeper disgusting body.  That's amazing.  Word.  Oh, Butcher's happy with his weight gain.  No.  It could be better.  217.  From what it was your original...  You weighed 217?  Yeah.  Jesus, I'm fucking fat.  I believe the last one was 216, if I'm not mistaken.  Yes, you've gained one pound.  Oh, a pound.  What the fuck?  He slowed down.  I think I outweigh all these people.  Really?  He's gained 8.6 overall. 
[03:49:00]  8.6 overall.  I'm trying, man.  You're working it.  All right.  You joke about your weight, Lily.  I've taken a dump in like two days.  What's that?  Your joke about your weight is fucking hilarious.  Oh, because I weigh 240 now, and it's not supposed to be your age plus 200 pounds.  Yeah.  I don't know how the weight is.  It's not in a good form.  No doctor's gonna tell you.  Hey, your age plus 200.  That's about what you should weigh.  That's never a rule of thumb to follow.  No.  I was watching a boxing match, and there was two guys, and they each weighed 115. 
[03:49:30]  And I realized these two guys still need a fat baby to make me.  Like two grown men.  I'm sure I'll weigh these guys if he weighs 217, because I'm usually at 240.  You have lost weight, though.  You lost weight, though.  Yeah, but I'm still there.  Slimming down.  All right, finally Eastside Dave.  Let's go.  Wasting away.  Here comes Dave.  Look at this disaster.  With pizza.  By the way, I gotta also mention that Eastside Dave is in Afro Wars.  Yes.  He's also in Afro Wars.  Dave, I want you to know that Than has back, he's done with Afro Wars. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, he's out.  He officially shaved.  Oh, yes.  So now it's down to you, Sam, and Danny.  But Sam is like, you're running away with this thing.  Sam has got the natural, round, African Afro.  Yeah, but Eastside Dave, it's getting interesting.  I'm coming on now.  You are, really?  Yeah.  I think I'm getting there.  Because of our show, he's gotta grow his hair out.  He's got a fucking huge belly.  Look at that.  Look at the gut.  Look at the like...  I have a Sopranos tattoo.  Look at his hate handles. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, show Louis CK the Sopranos tattoo.  Would you like to see my Sopranos tattoo?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  It is the worst tattoo ever.  What the fuck is that, Kenny?  Come here and look at this.  What the fuck is that, Kenny?  I want Mr. CK to see mine.  I don't even know who that's supposed to be.  He thinks these are the Sopranos.  Now, you ever see tats that look like real people?  Yeah.  Look at the horrible work this is.  That's awful.  It doesn't look like any of them.  That's awful.  Nobody looks like anybody.  Hold on.  Who did that?  Some guy from Long Island.  Nobody looks like anybody.  I didn't do a lot of background checking on this. 
[03:51:00]  That is horrible.  Janice looks like fucking Joe Pepitone.  Janice is one of the people you got?  Which one's Janice?  Janice?  No, it's not Meadow.  It looks like Meadow.  Meadow who looks like Janice, who looks like Joe Pepitone.  And then wait a minute.  Who looks like Gene Wilder.  The son looks like a superhero.  He looks like...  It looks like the Kiss Alive cover.  But also the shit this guy chooses to get tattooed.  It's like he sees an interesting McDonald's commercial and he's like,  I'm going to get a tattoo of that. 
[03:51:30]  I found that kind of amusing for a minute.  I'm going to get a tattoo of it on my body.  A bad one.  It just looks like Mount Douchemore.  My whole thing is it's a billboard of bets I've lost.  Yeah, he loses bets.  And Lucky Boy, which means pedophile in prison.  Great joke by Mr. Bennington, but Ron...  Lucky Boy means pedophile in prison?  Yeah, he tricked me.  You better not go to prison.  Wow.  So let's see...  No, that's my switch.  Yeah, step up there.  Let's see what he weighs though.  You are a fucking Dr. Zayas looking motherfucker.  That Sopranos tattoo is horrendous. 
[03:52:00]  Isn't that horrible?  Yeah.  And what was your starting weight?  195.  195, okay.  That's a sweet boy.  195, that is skinny.  202.2.  202.2.  Wow.  Jesus, I weigh way more than any of these people.  I thought that was a lot more.  So did I.  I'm very surprised at that number.  You have to work harder.  But seven pounds...  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Team...  You got a lot of stress in your life these days.  I do.  Team ONA is winning on all fronts right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Every class. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, every class.  Of course.  How do you like being married, Dave?  Do you like it?  I do, Jim.  I'm going to do a hot meal.  Once, twice a week.  I'm just kidding, baby!  Oh, I'm in trouble.  Are ya?  Oh, Louie's weighing himself.  Jesus Christ.  How much are you, sweetie?  242.  Oh my God.  242.  How do you look skinny?  Maybe you're putting all muscle on.  242, I'm gaining weight.  Dude, you don't...  You're all muscle?  You slimmed down.  You don't look like 242.  No, you really don't.  You hide it well.  That's what it says on the thing.  How tall are you?  5'10"? 
[03:53:00]  I'm six foot.  You're six foot.  I have a long torso, so I spread it out.  Is that it?  Look at this.  It's awful.  Wow.  All right, there's the weigh-in.  That was really exciting.  All right.  I liked it.  It was fun.  I like talking to these people.  Yeah, they're great.  Good group of people we have here.  Noon to three.  All right.  Noon to three.  All right.  Noon to three.  ONA, six to noon.  Thank you.  See you.  Thank you.  See ya.  You got anything else?  I love this kid.  I apologize for fucking being underweight. 
[03:53:30]  I will fucking pig out till I gain something.  Love foodie tank, Lou.  That's the shit.  Thanks, man.  And I appreciate the fact...  You actually made killing your kid kind of funny.  You know my kid?  When you said you had to buy the fucking tailpipe of the car.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I didn't kill her though.  She didn't die.  I said almost.  I didn't say you did.  Okay.  Hilarious, no doubt.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  All right.  Plays music.  Yeah.  Bronx Johnny gets his own music when he comes on our show.  Look at him just struts out.  There he goes.  Bronx Johnny, everybody.

Oh, I don't know.  I'm just feeling shy.  Ha-ha.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  That's what the doctor said during the sonogram, your cello's not doing well.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.

[03:56:30]  Louie, any plugs?  Fucking Wilkes Bar.  I don't have the paper.  Is it Wilkes-Barre?  Wilkes Bar.  It's the Kirby Center.  The Kirby Center and Wilkes Bar, March 7th.  But more importantly, Buffalo, the something center of the arts.  Hold on.  On February 14th.  And Cleveland, the Playhouse, on the 15th of February.  Please come to those shows.  Something center.  I have to plug...  No, you don't.  But I do. 
[03:57:00]  Okay.  Next weekend, not this weekend, but next weekend is Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  And then February 15th through 17th is Cobbs in San Francisco.  And I have a bunch of dates going on stale soon for, like, Seattle.  On stale?  On stale, yes.  We're going on stale.  No, I guess we're shit on the shelf.  As we shouldn't.  Some nitpicking douchebags.  I'm a tripping cunt.  Fucking...  I talk for a living and I can't do that properly.  I put T's where they don't belong.  Lost or not in cells.  Give me those ribs.  Under the rage joke, Sam. 
[03:57:30]  At least he's expanding his repertoire.  One impression, one joke.  And finally, Dr. Steve, the big plug for your show.  I want to thank you for sticking...  Yes.  I want to...  I want you to...  What?  Oh, all right.  Dr. Steve, everyone.  Hello.  Just want to thank you for sticking your finger up Roland's butt because, you know, it's your  bit now.  Thank you for the opportunity.  That's your thing.  Thank you for the opportunity.  But that's your thing.  We started it.  We got to keep it going.  Yeah.  It's a great thing to have.  I was working on a t-shirt for you, so...  Thanks, man. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Listen to Weird Medicine, 9 o'clock Eastern on XM 202 Saturday night on the Saturday night  virus.  Very good.  Tomorrow night.  Dr. Steve.  Tomorrow night.  Very entertaining show.  Thanks.  I'm going to come by and hang out.  Why?  Yeah.  Do that.  I like this.  And then we all go out afterwards and get shit-faced.  It's kind of fun.  Excellent.  Excellent.  It's excellent.  It's excellent, too.  Okay.  Big brother, man.  Oh, face!  Oh! 
[03:58:30]  Touche, my friend, too.  All right.  Quick count.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  Thanks, man.  Roland, anything?  Did he clean out your asshole?  I cleaned it out.  Was it gushy and kind of uncomfortable?  Liquid-y.  And what?  Like, liquid-y.  Yeah.  It wasn't that bad, right?  It was awkward.  It was awkward.  By the way, I just realized that I was talking to Lily with a fucking Breathe Right strip  on my nose, and I want to remove it with a shotgun blast.  All right.  First of all...  If she worked in my office, it would be...  She's doing a nose. 
[03:59:00]  Without it.  Oh, no.  I mean, without the Breathe Right strip.  No, but you don't want to just talk to her...  It's not even about that.  You just don't want to talk to a pretty girl with a fucking band-aid on your nose.  If I worked in an office where she worked, I would be just...  That would be my whole day.  Really?  Okay, it's been 24 minutes.  I think I can go over again.  I just...  No productivity whatsoever.  It would just be constant.  Remember those days?  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  If you ever had to work in a real office...  And there'd be a girl who's just like, she doesn't have a scar across her face, so you're 
[03:59:30]  in love with her.  You're like, oh my God, she weighs less than 300, and she doesn't smell like actual shit.  I want to have a...  I guess they really did need to invent human resources, because I forgot about that.  You would always come up with some dumb excuse why you had to go to that side of the office  or just walk by.  Just asking for something or...  Exactly.  Hey, how's it going?  Did you notice if they had dropped...  If there's their new coffee in the coffee machine?  Yeah, it's all dump stuff.  I don't know. 
[04:00:00]  You may want to just go check it.  I should go check it.  You're right.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm going to go jerk off to you in my cubicle.  Louis, that is hilarious.  Oh, it's so sad.  It's so true, though.  Is that the new Nissan I saw you pulling up in this morning?  Yes.  Just anything to maybe get a little more personal into your personal life that I could talk about?  And the best part is she was always like a four or five, like you said.  It wasn't even that special, but it was like the only female in the area.  You just stare.  You just look at her neck and her fucking cheeks. 
[04:00:30]  You're like, she's got the best skin in the world.  So you're going to shenanigans with everybody on Friday?  God damn it.  Yeah, no, huh?  No.  All right.  That's fun.  Great.  All right, guys.  We'll see you Monday.  It's Flea Man from Westchester.  I love Jim Norton because of his brutal honesty, his hilarious commentary on society, and that  he likes to kill, rape, and eat people and admit it.  Do you have any fantasies about Jim?  I'd like to be in between him and Rich Voss and have them flip a coin to decide who fucks 
[04:01:00]  me.  Fucks me.  Fucks me.  Fucks me.  I'll be in happening. </pre>
