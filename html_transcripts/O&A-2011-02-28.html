<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Jim Norton recounting his post-Portland and Cincinnati trip, highlighting the attractive women in Portland, the unexpected snowfall, and an uncomfortable medical checkup with a large, seemingly incompetent technician.  The bulk of the show centered on a scathing, vulgar critique of the 83rd Academy Awards, specifically targeting Anne Hathaway and James Franco's hosting, which they deemed awkward and poorly executed, speculating on Franco's possible drug use or extreme nervousness.  They contrasted this negatively with Norm Macdonald's superior comedic live tweeting of the event.  Other Oscar moments discussed included Kirk Douglas's appearance (with subsequent graphic speculation about an accident involving defecation), Melissa Leo's use of the f-word, and the lack of applause during the "in memoriam" segment. Audio clips from the Oscars, including Hathaway and Franco's monologue and Kirk Douglas's presentation, were played. The hosts also engaged in extensive, vulgar commentary about various actresses' physiques, particularly Mila Kunis, Hilary Swank, and Scarlett Johansson.  The show extensively covered Charlie Sheen's recent controversies and rumors, including playing audio clips from interviews and discussing his negative drug test.

A caller shared an anecdote about a man who had sex with a woman born in the 1800s, prompting further crude jokes.  The hosts also pitched their fictional, darkly comedic and offensive Oprah Winfrey Network TV show concept, "The Rape of Agatha Dinsley," providing a graphic description of the plot.  Clips from *True Grit* were played, and the *Spider-Man* Broadway show delays were briefly mentioned.  The show also included a discussion of Oprah's Master Class, described as boring and featuring an unappealing website design. This transitioned into graphic discussions of male anatomy and bodily functions, along with mockery of medical illustrations of the reproductive system.  A caller, Tommy from Hazleton, PA, described a house fire, hinting at racial tensions with his neighbors and attributing it to a kerosene explosion, prompting further speculation from the hosts.  E-Rock's absence was noted, with speculation about a faked illness.  A news story about a major mayonnaise spill was read, generating more crude jokes.  The hosts discussed celebrities known for self-destruction (Sheen, Spears, Woods), played a staff-created song incorporating Charlie Sheen quotes, and reviewed a news story about a fake cancer doctor who committed sexual assault.  An audio clip of the Fab Faux playing "I Am The Walrus" was positively received.

Actor Michael Madsen joined the show.  He recounted a humorous incident involving his son and a bungee cord, shared anecdotes about deceased friends and colleagues (Chris Penn, David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, Bob Crane), and detailed his experiences filming *Reservoir Dogs*, including improvisational moments, interactions with Quentin Tarantino, and behind-the-scenes stories. He discussed obtaining Steve McQueen's shotgun. Madsen shared stories about his previous jobs, his son's aspirations, and interactions with Marlon and Christian Brando.  He promoted his roles in *Kill Bill*, *Strength and Honor*, and his book, *American Badass*.  He also mentioned Charlie Sheen's presence at Christopher Penn's funeral.  A separate segment featured Madsen discussing his career, rejecting reality TV offers, and promoting his new film, "The Bleeding."  The hosts also discussed Michael Douglas's health struggles and the media's coverage of both his and Charlie Sheen's lives.

Finally, a significant portion of the show involved highly offensive and graphic commentary on a news story about a male nurse, John Rimes, charged with sexually abusing elderly patients, with the hosts speculating on the victims' reactions and the nurse's motivations and engaging in dark humor about potential violent retribution.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream  style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, it starts funny and it starts funny and it starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and they've even gotten their  show suspended from satellite radio. 
[00:04:00]  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh, funny. 
[00:04:30]  Ah, morning.  Hi, everybody.  Jimmy's back!  Jimmy Norton.  Yes, I am.  Hi.  You were in, uh, Bigfoot country.  I was in Portland, yeah, and I woke, I went to bed last night at 10.30 because I was so  tired from the flight.  I woke up at 2.30 in the morning.  I'm not meant to sleep.  What are you doing?  I'm on West Coast time.  It was like a nap.  Oh.  Are you refreshed?  No. 
[00:05:00]  No.  I just kept, I kept, I kept lying in bed thinking, I can't breathe.  You're suffocating.  It was a horrendous.  Oh, God.  Right back to normal.  Oh, God.  Thank you to Portland.  Very small crowds.  Not a draw in Portland, but man, were they fucking hot.  Oh, good.  Oh, really?  Literally, it's like, the helium was so good, it's like I would film something in that fucking  room.  They really appreciated the comedy, huh?  Wow.  Unbelievable.  The crowds that were there were amazing.  Very good.  Very cool.  How's Kid Chris, our old pal?  He's great, man.  It was good to see him.  He was well.  He actually texted me on my old phone I happened to have with me, and he's like, hey, man, 
[00:05:30]  I'd love to see you in Portland.  I didn't even know he was out there, but he's doing great, and it's like one of the few  terrestrial shows that's like a small company owns it, and you can still have a good time  on it.  Oh, so you could have some fun with that.  It was fucking fun, man.  Yeah, it was like doing his show eight years ago or ten years ago in Sacramento when I used to  do it.  Oh, wow.  It felt the same.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah.  He's doing good.  I'm glad he landed on his feet, and he's doing well.  Yeah.  What about the Bigfoot thing?  Is it all over the place out there?  I've never been to Portland.  I didn't know that it was fucking ... I thought it was like Chicago, weather-wise, but they 
[00:06:00]  had like an inch of snow, and they're like, oh, weather permitting, we'll get out there.  What are you doing, you faggots?  Just fucking take a toothbrush and ... There's nothing on the ground.  Yeah, what else do you have to do but clean up your stupid snow?  They don't get snow out there.  They don't get cold weather.  They get it down to like 40.  Portland doesn't get snow.  No, dude, I thought that they would have been like a ... They're like, no.  You would think they would get something.  Nothing.  Hmm.  Very cool.  But they were nice people, and Cincinnati was lovely, you know?  Oh, fuck.  That's ... We haven't seen you since Cincinnati?  Dude, I've been gone, and because of the day off, and because there's no fucking afternoon 
[00:06:30]  flights anymore out to ... Anywhere.  You have to fly out the night before the morning of.  Yeah, right, right.  I was in L.A., and then I went to Portland.  So you were in L.A., Cincinnati, and Portland.  Yeah, man.  Guess what?  We were here the whole fucking time.  Yeah.  It was great.  I missed it, though.  I left being gone for a day or two, but I really missed this.  I don't like being away.  I fucking missed a gig, man.  I really do.  I would hate to not have this gig.  I'm going to start getting edgy.  Itchy.  I got to get back on there.  I got to get a mic in front of me.  You're not talking. 
[00:07:00]  You're talking with your friends, but you're not coming on here no matter what you want.  Like, today we'll talk about the Oscars or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Who else am I going to talk about?  It's my girlfriend who talks too loud at three in the morning.  What was she doing?  Nothing.  She just talks loud.  She doesn't mean to.  Why was she up at three, too?  I get up, and she get up at 4.30 and whatever, and she's dropping N-bombs.  It's like, you know, we have to live here.  What are you doing?  Jesus Christ.  That's hysterical.  Literally.  It's like she's like Edward Norton with tits.  It's like, what are you doing?  Who's she dropping N-bombs at?  Whoever.  Anybody who fits that mold. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  It didn't matter what reason.  I understand.  Do you understand he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs at one point?  Just loud.  But she's not being angry.  She just talks loud.  That's really funny.  Oh, God.  Just wandering around.  Fantastic.  And then we talk about Lady Gaga and the song that's obviously the Madonna ripoff, and  she's just loud about it.  And she's like, and you know, and she just starts fucking, I'm like, all right, I got  it.  It's fucking five o'clock.  You're screaming.  Fucking maniac. 
[00:08:00]  I got it.  We're not even mad at you.  She's not yelling at me.  She's talking.  She talks loud, huh?  She fucking dies.  And then just stares at you waiting for a response.  And it's the middle of the night, right?  Dude, it's fucking literally.  You just want to chill.  I was at 2.30.  I finally get up at 4.30.  Yeah.  And she's like, you can't sleep?  And I wanted to go out and have some coffee and an apple by myself.  But that wasn't meant to be.  Oh, no.  No, it was fine.  Just chatting.  It was nice, actually.  What a horrible middle of the night snack.  Dude.  Coffee and an apple. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  I'm like, what will ruin my breath and make me shit at the same time?  Right.  Ah-ha.  Oh, fuck.  Dude, I was so annoyed.  I couldn't.  There's nothing worse than not being able to go back to sleep.  I went for heart tests.  I was fucking.  I literally thought I had a valve fucked up because I'm like, I'm not getting the blood's not leaving my lungs fast enough.  There's something wrong.  And what do they say?  I didn't talk to her yet, but she still had the message that it looks pretty normal.  Did you go to my lady?  I don't know.  You said her.  Probably, yeah.  She's a heavy lady with glasses. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  She's very nice.  I wanted to leave as soon as I went in there because, like he just said, I went to get my heart checked as well.  And the lady checking it is fat.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, wait a minute.  I'm like, you're not taking care of your heart.  Why am I here?  Why don't you pop up on this fucking thing and check yourself out?  It has to be.  She's.  It is the same person.  Okay.  That ghoul of an assistant she has.  Yeah.  What's he about?  He sounds.  He's like, okay, lie back.  Lie on your side.  He sounds like every fucking, every awful lawyer who does a commercial for himself.  Have you been injured?  Did your heart stop? 
[00:09:30]  Call the lady I work for because she did it.  He's a fucking ghoul and he gives you nothing.  And what did he put on those?  What do they call those things?  Those suction things?  The electrode thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But he puts them on really like carefully and there's like a little more to it.  He might have handled you differently.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I have a lot of side fat.  You don't.  I was like a fucking four in that room.  You were probably eight and a half to him.  Sometimes they just all go like.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, he was, he was carefully put them, putting them on my body. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And then he's like, oh, wait, I have to redo this one, this one.  And he's redoing them.  I'm like, it's the time we put on the electrode.  But she's fat.  I'm like, God.  Did you do this?  I did the, I did the whole thing.  Cardiogram or like echogram, I think it's called where you lay there and they take and  they do a sonogram.  So I'm like, how does it look?  He's like, the doctor will explain everything.  I'm like, thank you.  But you're here.  Don't you know what you're doing?  Yeah, man.  You know what the good and bad looks like?  The tech people enjoy you panicking. 
[00:10:30]  I don't think they're allowed to really tell you.  Well, yeah, you're right.  You're 100% right.  But most of them are cool enough to go.  I'm not allowed to.  But they give you the look like, don't worry about you.  You're cool.  But some of these people go, oh, the doctor will let you know.  And then you just start thinking crazy things.  He's like, you think, well, he would have said something if I was all right.  So obviously something is drastically wrong and I'm going to find out any moment now.  I like when there's like anything where they go like, hmm.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hmm.  And then they go like, what? 
[00:11:00]  They go, no, I got a loose cable here.  Yeah.  It's like, no, you fuck.  You don't go, hmm.  Yeah.  You go, there's a loose cable here.  Hmm.  I think they love the power trip.  Yeah.  They're in a position where they know you're panicking and they really get into it.  Did you get the, because I have a leaky valve, but she said it's pretty normal.  It's nothing serious.  I got the.  What, the little backup action?  A teeny bit, yeah.  Yeah, that's more common than you realize.  I think I got a little of that.  Yeah, she said it was okay.  It was nothing.  But they wanted to make sure there was nothing. 
[00:11:30]  And I haven't gone into detail, but they give you the, they shoot you with radiation for  the, and then you do a distress test, which I did very well on.  But then they give you a card because you have to go through airport security when  you go, and they're like, in case you just head off a machine.  Oh.  You have to show them this fucking flimsy card that nobody would believe.  Oh, really?  What does it look like a dumb library card or something?  Exactly.  That somebody has written and circled something.  Call us.  Who are you?  Grace.  Yeah, that fucking happened to me when I was going through customs.  Forgot where I was going or something, but I just had like one of those.  Thailand?  Barium stress.  Thailand. 
[00:12:00]  It was Thailand, I remember.  Poor little lad's mouth was radioactive.  His little hiney.  Oh, you're making my filling hurt.  Yeah, so, yeah, that happened, and the customs guy went, he goes, I walked up and something  started beeping, and he goes, he picks it up and reset it.  He goes, have you had a, you know, barium stress test recently?  I was like, oh, yeah. 
[00:12:30]  And then I'm looking like, how the fuck did they get that info?  Yeah, that's crazy.  Like, what has he got written down on that sheet?  Yeah.  And he's like, yeah, it's setting off the radiation thing.  It's like, oh, that's healthy.  Yeah, you don't want to know you're ever radioactive.  I'm radioactive.  Well, they told me, don't hold any babies for like 24 hours.  Like, don't be around small babies.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  They did.  Shouldn't you have told them that that's a law?  You can't be around them at all, any time?  Thanks to that whole canker situation.  Yeah, but they said you can't touch small, small infants or whatever for 24 hours because 
[00:13:00]  of your radioactivity.  So you checked out all right or what?  I think so.  She left me a message, but she was nice.  She goes, we wanted to call, talk to your results.  She goes, but looks normal, fine.  She goes, but if you want to call, we'll talk about it.  And I want to ask about an apnea thing that she was going to investigate.  And I'm going to go get my lungs chest.  I don't know why I had this sleeping thing.  Halfway through my stress test, she's actually told me, why are you even here?  Oh, really?  I'm like, because it's in my family and I'm getting up there.  Yeah, right?  Half my uncle, half my fucking family has heart issues. 
[00:13:30]  Dude, I was almost rooting for something like a block valve and a stent because I was so  frustrated with this thing that happens.  That would have explained what it is.  That would have been like, oh, okay, this was blocked and now I'm good.  But now I have to go for more tests and figure out what it is.  You don't want any of your shit blocked ever.  I guess not, no.  If that's psychological, what are you going to do?  Just, it will be a lot easier to realize that there's nothing physically wrong.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  You want to go to a meditation class?  I certainly don't.  No.  Are you going to?  I'm going to have a nice story this week. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, no.  I'm going to a meditation class.  I'm trying to get this fucking anger out of my fucking mind.  Wow, you're going to a meditation class, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Do you just sit there and om?  I have fucking no idea.  And it's a beginner class.  I'm like, a beginner class?  Aren't they the same class?  How could there be an advanced sitting?  An advanced class where you just concentrate on your breathing.  Come on.  It's advanced sitting and doing nothing.  Exactly.  I don't know.  It's either going to be really boring for the radio or it might have a story.  We'll see. 
[00:14:30]  What happened?  No, I'm just looking at Mike Tyson.  Oh.  Well, Jimmy's back and we're very happy.  Portland was a success.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Portland was okay.  I wish there was more people.  Cincinnati was great.  It's kind of like really far away, though.  It's fucking, it's just a much smaller city.  Do you know they have the most strip clubs per fucking cap in the country?  Like, I didn't even go to one.  Oh, you should have just to see what it's all about.  Ooh, really?  Yeah, I just couldn't though.  I'm like, it just sets me off.  We had one.  It sets me off.  It really does.  Especially in a bad place.  One of the hottest strippers we ever had on the show came from Portland. 
[00:15:00]  I never forgot her.  Although I forgot her name.  Portland, Oregon?  Yeah.  And she was starting.  From Portland, Maine.  Do you remember that girl?  Oh, Iraq's not here because a mayo truck fucking crashed on the highway.  Oh, God.  Did you hear that story?  Everybody was tweeting it.  I'm like, oh, hey guys, did you hear this?  And I clicked the link and I'm like, oh, this story again.  A lot of people are going to be disappointed that Iraq's not here for a beating.  Yeah, why isn't Iraq here right after a mayo truck fucking overturns and spills mayo all over the street? 
[00:15:30]  All over the fucking highway.  Where is he?  Is he okay?  Tired from cleaning it up.  Okay.  Yeah, he's tired from...  With his tongue.  Yeah.  Fat kid.  He can't talk.  His tongue is raw.  But a girl with some nice big natural ones used to do our show at NAW.  She was one of the locals.  She danced at...  I can't remember where anymore.  Portland.  And then she was moving back to Portland.  We have Car Crash Comedy this Friday too, right?  Yes, we do.  Fuck.  Yes.  I'm actually looking forward to that.  And we're finally doing Deadly as Snatch too.  A week from Friday. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, good, good, good.  We'll be talking about that this week.  We need a few more contestants.  Oh, fuck.  And I think we got like $2,000.  Yeah.  Is that not counting the money we all decided to pop in?  I don't know.  We decided to chip in some cash.  That's including ours?  Yeah.  Fuck.  I was hoping I didn't have to actually fucking, you know, get the money.  I thought that would motivate other people to...  Yeah, to come forward and go, no, you don't have to give the money.  We got it.  Right.  We'll take care of it.  We'll get, you know, Steven Singer or something to put the bill. 
[00:16:30]  Well, I got to tell you, I stayed up all night and stayed up all night for the Oscars.  And I don't know why I did.  Well, the Oscars themselves sucked monkey ass.  Absolutely.  But there's a phenomenon happening today that is just amazing.  It is Twitter.  And it has turned every big worldwide event into mystery science theater.  Right.  Where you're able to...  This is the closest you're going to get to sitting in a room watching an event with genuinely funny celebrities and comics and laughing your ass off. 
[00:17:00]  And everybody blurting shit out.  It's fucking hysterical.  Travis gave me a heads up.  And everybody else, I guess, all other five people that follow Travis, gave us all a heads up.  He goes, you got to fucking follow Norm Macdonald. 
[00:17:30]  Norm is killing.  So I'm like, all right, I like Norm.  I click on there and I'm following him.  And this motherfucker was tweeting every few seconds and everything was hilarious.  He was beyond funny.  Because you read it in Norm's voice.  Right.  So whereas somebody else could have tweeted the same thing, it wouldn't have been as funny.  When Norm was tweeting it, you picture that Norm cadence and delivery and stuff.  But it was some of the funniest shit I've ever read at an event like that. 
[00:18:00]  I was crying.  He absolutely became the king of live tweeting last night.  Yeah.  I mean, he raised the fucking bar.  Because then you tweeted, you're checking out Norm Macdonald.  So now I'm like, okay, I'm going to check out Norm Macdonald.  Yeah, yeah.  And he made me put my phone down for a while.  How the fuck do I compete with this shit?  I compete with that.  But you just keep fucking tugging away.  Click, click, click.  Right, right.  Hoping something sticks on the damn comedy wall. 
[00:18:30]  Something's got to be funny.  Right.  But you get people that are like, I was following a few people.  And, you know, just funny shit.  Yeah, it was great.  It was funny.  I had people like, I have a follow, the follow feature.  And if you don't want to follow people all the time, you can just chase them around for a little while.  And Norm was fucking great.  I had Kevin Smith on.  Kevin Smith was doing it pretty straight, though.  Right.  He was giving like the inside kind of thing, which was a good. 
[00:19:00]  Which was another angle.  Yeah, everybody doesn't have to be.  You get a few different looks, right?  Ripping everybody apart.  Yeah.  Like vultures.  Norm was hysterical.  Absolutely.  That was cute.  I don't even know if you'd do it justice by reading any of his tweets.  No, it was just.  It was right at the moment.  Although his last tweet, it was after I signed off.  He said, you guys were the 83rd best hosts ever.  83rd. 
[00:19:30]  He was hammering.  When hair plugs met Sally.  Yeah.  When Billy Crystal walked out, I was just like, if he starts singing, I'm going to shoot my television.  I was going to.  He just presented.  But, in a weird way, a lot of people were so happy to see Billy Crystal on that stage.  Sure.  No joke, because Anne Hathaway and James Franco sucked a bag of dick.  How could they not be terrible?  They were horrendous.  It was so utterly bad.  And I felt bad for Anne Hathaway. 
[00:20:00]  She was like trying her best.  She was standing on her head.  Right.  She was trying her best to get something going.  James Franco, to me, in my humble opinion, looked fucking stoned out of his gourd.  I believe he was on something.  It looked like he was on something.  His eyes were constantly shut.  When he did barely open them, they were glassy as hell.  But where do you get high? 
[00:20:30]  All eyes are on you.  Because you're the host of the show and you're doing interviews in the red carpet.  Where the fuck do you go?  Or maybe they threw a pill in them.  There's a lot of downtime.  You go to the bathroom.  You fucking whatever you need to do.  I think he was scared.  You think he was scared?  Yeah.  He was obviously the wrong choice.  And she was the wrong choice.  Yeah.  They wanted to go younger and they wanted to go safe.  That's what the Oscars were thinking.  And they failed miserably.  Yeah.  They really did.  Do you know what I found out?  And this is why the awards win what they win. 
[00:21:00]  The average age of the Academy, I think, is 57.  Yeah.  If you wonder why fucking old people love this shit and young people think it stinks, it's  because you've got 57-year-old people making the decision.  Well, they acknowledged that and they said, we're trying to make the Oscars younger.  That's what I think Anne Hathaway or one of them said.  Yeah.  They were trying to bring down the demo.  Oof.  They obviously wanted to avoid a Ricky Gervais type host.  These two, there was only one joke about the celebrities themselves and it was a Charlie 
[00:21:30]  Sheen joke.  Of course.  Look out.  Which is the easiest joke to make in that position.  It's so safe at this point, right?  Who's going to be offended?  Charlie Sheen's not even going to be offended by someone making fun of them.  No.  You knew they'd be terrible.  You should have had him come out and do like a cameo.  Yeah.  There was a moment in the open where they did some Inception thing with Alec Baldwin.  Yeah.  And I thought, how great would the spin be where they were never going to be the host?  And then all of a sudden Alec Baldwin goes, no, that was a dream.  You're not hosting the fucking Oscars. 
[00:22:00]  And then he walks out.  And he hosts.  That would have been, well, that would be just too crazy for Hollywood, though, right?  No one would have been able to keep that secret.  But everybody would be talking about how, wow, they pulled a fast one on everyone and it  was actually Alec Baldwin the whole time that was hosting.  Like, James Franco couldn't read off the teleprompter.  He couldn't fucking, I don't think he can act either.  It's like, how is he up for an Oscar?  They're all terrible on the teleprompter.  That's how hard that is to do.  These guys, I mean, actors have a hard time doing that stuff. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then we should come back and call each other again.  Are you a fucking idiot?  Have you ever done this before professionally?  And then they awkwardly look at each other and go like, and now the nominees.  It's like, there's our little joke.  Yeah.  It bombed.  Yeah.  And now get to the business at hand.  Do you have opinions about the winners and stuff?  I certainly do.  Yeah, we could do it.  Yeah, yeah.  I was going to play.  Oh, you have some of their jokes?  Well, Anne Hathaway and James Franco opening the show. 
[00:23:00]  I mean, usually the first five minutes of the show, when they have a comedian, is usually  kind of good.  Yeah.  They take shots and they talk about the movies.  This was just horrendously bad.  Oh my gosh, you're all real.  Wow.  This is actually happening.  Okay.  Hello, and welcome to the 83rd Annual Academy Awards.  Cheap applause.  Yes, Jimmy.  They stink already.  Yeah.  Already.  I've never heard anybody stink before the clapping stopped. 
[00:23:30]  Holy mackerel.  That was an intro to a junior high school talent show.  That sounded like someone walked out onto a stage at a school and said, welcome to our  talent show.  Yes.  Yes.  And they handled it like such.  And like you said, I mean, if you hang out on Twitter a little bit, you see all the  people that could possibly be hosting this thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, why are they hosting the Oscars?  They get a...  I hate to say it, but you'd rather have a Billy Crystal. 
[00:24:00]  Why don't they get Norm out there?  I never imagined.  Doug, hey, why aren't they thanking the computer?  I don't understand this Facebook movie.  They should be thanking the computer.  Do yourself a favor as we talk about the Oscars.  Go to Norm MacDonald.  M-A-C, you know, Donald on Twitter.  And the two guys that came out and thanked their wives, and they were obviously gay.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like they point to these beards in the audience, and Norm's like...  He just tweets like, what? 
[00:24:30]  Like, you're just reading, what?  He goes, the Wolfman's more believable than these guys having wives.  I'm reading one here.  Oh, great.  30 British guys.  Yeah, British.  He was ragging on that.  Right.  The fucking stuttering guy.  Did you do the Wolfman one?  Yeah, he had a few Wolfman ones.  She looks nothing like a black swan.  That dude looks exactly like a Wolfman.  And then they had the guy that won for the King's Speech. 
[00:25:00]  Colin Firth.  Yeah, Colin Firth.  He came out and won for the King's Speech.  And then right after that, they were doing Best Picture, and they had his speech from the King's Speech with all the clips going.  Right.  And Norm just tweets, he goes, hey, the guy narrating this sounds just like the guy that just won the award.  It's just nonsensical Norm greatness.  Did you notice Colin Firth was one word away from stuttering, though? 
[00:25:30]  From being the stuttering guy that can't fucking give a speech.  I thought everyone said how great his performance was, but it seems like he's very close to being a stutter in real life.  He didn't stutter, obviously, but it looked like at any moment he could.  Yep.  Really odd.  And then that other old guy that won, I guess he wrote it.  Did he write it or something?  I don't know.  And he couldn't find the microphone.  Oh, really?  He was just standing there, and then they had to point him to the microphone. 
[00:26:00]  That was awkward.  Yeah.  Nothing worse, though, than when they fucking paraded Kirk Douglas out onto that stage.  We'll get there.  Yeah, yeah.  I just want to say I was horrified.  My jaw dropped.  I was just like, wait.  Why are you horrified?  That's exactly what you want to see.  Oh, it's what you want to see, but I was like, they're not doing this.  Right.  They are not doing this.  Yeah.  Oh, they did it all right. 
[00:26:30]  Oh.  Guy turns out to be 95, by the way.  Wow.  Is he?  95.  That's another thing Norm wrote.  He's like, who knew a massive stroke was great for comedic comedy?  We got every second of Kirk Douglas, by the way.  But first, a little more of Anne Hathaway and James Franco starting this mess.  Anne, I must say, you look so beautiful and so hip.  Oh, thank you, James.  Yeah.  You look very appealing to a younger demographic as well. 
[00:27:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  So here we are, and it's Hollywood's biggest night.  And it's very exciting for both of us because we're both nominated.  Uh, actually, James, I'm not nominated tonight.  Oh, come on, Anne.  Don't be so modest.  I'm not modest.  I'm just not nominated.  You know.  All right.  It used to be.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Well, all right.  And that's where it ended. 
[00:27:30]  And he goes, it's fedding, fedding for both of us because we're both nomineed.  Oh, he said that?  Nomineed.  How about nominated?  He was really fucking scared.  He looked wasted out of his gourd.  Because these people are dull.  They're dull.  Most actors, and, you know, not the ones with personality like the great one we have coming  in today, but the fucking most of them are horribly dull.  Who picked these two?  They should never be able to pick another Oscar.  No, no.  Someone's head should roll.  Look, you don't want a Ricky Gervais type of guy, but, I mean, you drop this low. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  There's no one in between.  She was fishing for applause bricks.  All right.  It used to be, you get naked, you get nominated.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  But enough about me.  James, you are nominated tonight.  We got it.  When she said, but enough about me, we knew that it was you. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  There was no real reason to add that in.  When they did the little pre-interview with James Franco before the show, and he's sitting  there, and he wasn't answering anything, I knew right then, I'm like, uh-oh, there's  going to be trouble with this guy.  And it looks like James Franco hates Anne Hathaway.  You think so?  I think he's just miserable.  That's going to come out in the next couple of days.  Well, they had no chemistry between them.  None.  They probably-  Were nominated tonight?  Sorry, James.  No, no, no.  I was going to say they probably didn't hang out or talk. 
[00:29:00]  They probably did the rehearsals.  No.  And had like a little meal together.  But literally, when I hosted, again, not to make it about me, when I hosted with Jenna  at the Porn Awards, we met and we had a meeting together.  And then I think I didn't see her until rehearsal.  Like, we went good, but there was no hanging out.  There was no-  Yeah.  And it was like the same with the other person I hosted.  It's like, you should probably hang out a little bit so you get a cadence with each  other.  That was a mistake I made.  Or at least find two people that know each other very well.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, something. 
[00:29:30]  Something.  They were just, obviously, they're just two fucking separate entities put together.  It was absolutely terrible.  You are nominated tonight for Best Actor.  Your first nomination.  Thank you.  Tell us, are you nervous?  Uh, no.  No.  Come on, you must want to win a little bit.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, what do you get if you win?  You get an Oscar.  Yeah, but do I, like, get money with it, or?  No, you get prestige. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  For the rest of your life, everyone will refer to you as Academy Award winner James Franco.  What do you mean everyone?  Like, even my mom?  I'd be weird if my mom called me Academy Award winner James Franco.  I've known her a long time.  He said Academy.  Academy.  He's slurring.  These bombing idiots.  Oh, God.  They're, it's like me at the cellar, working on material.  Oh, shit.  They're fucking horrible. 
[00:30:30]  They are really, they were incredibly bad.  We would have all taken a Billy Crystal song at this point, right?  Oh, slow down.  Him singing about all the nominees, it's terrific when he does that.  Oh, we're here at the Oscars.  Doing his black guy impression.  When he walked out on that stage, I was like, no, no.  I thought it was going to be like a, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I'm here, I'm here for the Oscars. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, I hate Billy Crystal.  Do you?  Yes.  Don't find him entertaining.  Is he too swammy?  He had a humorous anecdote about Bob Hope.  Yeah, and then the Oscars decide to do a little something with Bob Hope to show how great an Oscar host could be.  Yeah.  That was smart.  So they had a podium set up, right?  And then there was this like kind of screen that you couldn't see.  It was like a hologram.  A hologram of Bob Hope comes on.  Kind of creepy.  And he starts, I didn't know Bob Hope was a Sith Lord. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Because he looked like he was beaming in a message.  And he's killing.  Dead Bob Hope was killing.  How many times did he, because I know Billy hosted it eight times.  Eighteen.  He hosted eighteen of them?  Eighteen times.  Yep.  Bob Hope.  Oh my God.  Yeah, yeah.  See, that's smart though.  Back in the old Hollywood days.  And then he intros the next two presenters.  Who was doing the Bob Hope impression? 
[00:32:00]  Or did they splice some shit?  Oh no, that sounded awful.  It did, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  And he was like, yeah, nah, yeah, Jude Law.  Yeah.  It wasn't Bob Hope.  They should have had him host the whole fucking thing then.  Yeah.  A hologram Bob Hope was way better than James Franco and Anne Hathaway.  Oh, definitely.  I'd watch it.  I've known her a long time.  Is your mom here tonight?  I think, yeah.  She's somewhere.  My mom's here too.  Hi, Mom.  Hi.  My mom, everybody. 
[00:32:30]  You look so beautiful, Mom.  Oh, thank you, honey.  Annie, honey.  Yeah?  Stand up straight.  Mr. Steven Spielberg's here, honey.  Really, Mom?  In front of a million people?  You're going to be out?  I'm sorry.  Okay, thank you.  I take the note, Mom.  I take the note.  I take the note, Mom.  Lily, sit down.  My grandma's here too.  How am I doing, Grandma?  This is painful. 
[00:33:00]  This is in front of a billion people.  These are the Oscars!  Right, in front of a billion fucking people.  It's painful.  And I don't even fault the actors.  You're supposed to be dull, and you are.  It's whoever made the decision.  I mean, James Franco didn't...  This is what he does.  He's an actor.  He's not a guy who does this.  What do they see in these two?  He's a bad actor.  Not on the movie screen, because that's different.  Right, right, right.  They know that craft very well, but obviously Franco and Anne Hathaway have done enough  interviews and things on the side, and then they decided, no, these two need to be hosting 
[00:33:30]  the Oscars.  Holy fuck.  Isn't it unbelievable?  Dude, it's embarrassing.  It really is.  I enjoy watching people bomb a lot.  This is uncomfortable.  It was uncomfortable.  Notice not one joke about anybody in Hollywood.  No, it's all polite laughs, and in the past, everyone has just beat up everybody in the  crowd.  Great job.  You guys are great.  You're great. 
[00:34:00]  I just saw Marky Mark.  That's actually Mark Wahlberg, Academy Award nominee.  Yes, and we loved his film, The Fighter.  Oh, no, no.  All right, it's been such a great year for big studio pictures, tiny independent films.  And it's been a great year for lesbians. 
[00:34:30]  That's right.  Not just in general, but in movies.  The kids are all right.  Lesbians.  Black swan.  Dancing lesbians.  Toy Story 3.  Where's the dad?  Tonight, we will honor the great films and talents of the past year, and also occasionally  look back at some of the best movies in Oscar history.  Let's begin with one of the most enduring and beloved films of the last century, a classic 
[00:35:00]  from 1939 that remains a classic today.  That's it.  That's all we're going to play for.  It's heinous.  It only got worse.  It only, yeah, it's...  And then at one point, he comes out in a dress.  Yeah, well, I guess they figured, look, we got nothing else for you.  Can you please put this dress on?  Just put a dress on and walk out and get a laugh.  Because they're not, you know, they're not like, like, I'm just looking at a clip of  Walter, I'm not listening to it, looking at him introducing on YouTube, like, Lucille 
[00:35:30]  Ball and Bob Hope.  But Matthau was an old fucking school guy.  He wasn't some, ugh, just horrendous.  And like, people that could just be funny.  You know, maybe ad-lib a little bit.  It was painful.  There were just painful moments after moments.  And some great moments, because after the break, we got it clear of the field, so we  have some time for Kirk Douglas.  Kirk Douglas.  All I can say is, wow. 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  How does a body keep living when it gets to that point?  I don't know.  Boy, is he clinging on.  His face was frozen.  I know he's 95, but...  The Grim Reaper actually led him out onto the stage.  Horror show.  He looked like a Muppet.  Yeah, my brother just texted me real quick.  He goes, uh, the Crypt Keeper.  Because he did have, his face looked like the Crypt Keeper.  But he was funnier than Anne Hathaway and James Franco. 
[00:36:30]  I know we're going to make fun of...  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't understand a word he was saying.  There's a couple of laughs in there.  Yeah?  If you get past the whole weird Dick Clark stroke thing.  The...  And Anne Hathaway's like, oh, be still my heart.  She's like, oh, boy, you know, when...  Like, yeah, we'll go out.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  You smell like piss, sir.  Yes, terrific work in the past.  You're basking in your own urine at this point.  I'm not letting you eat my pussy. 
[00:37:00]  I don't care who you are.  I don't care how good your son is in movies.  You don't like that fake we'll-go-out crap?  It's like, yeah.  Like the old guy and the young girl.  And it's like, well, you, you know.  The only place I like seeing that is at my house.  Wouldn't it be great if she just gave him an honest response?  Yeah.  Stop it.  When was the last time you got a rod?  Exactly.  I'd rather fuck anybody in this room but you.  His dick hole looks just like his mouth.  It's just all kind of leaking something. 
[00:37:30]  Like a bass trying to kick a fucking hook out.  Oh, yeah.  Well, after the break, we'll play the Kirk Douglas audio.  Oh, please.  And Christian Bale, forgetting his wife's name.  We'll get into that.  I know.  There's a controversy there.  And Melissa Leo, was she the one from The Fighter?  The mom from The Fighter?  She dropped the F-bomb.  Yeah.  And what I love, I got it in front of me.  Of course, it's America.  So, holy shit, you can't have the F-bomb on TV. 
[00:38:00]  We got the British version of the Oscars where they're like, ah, fuck.  They just let it fly?  Yes, of course.  Because they're not uptight over there.  Yeah.  They know that saying fuck on TV is not going to stop the world.  Well, the show itself is British.  The whole Oscars have just turned, they give the awards to British people all the time.  That's all that wins anymore.  No black people this year.  Really?  Where?  No black people up for awards.  Oh.  Were there any movies that were, I couldn't think of any one that I thought should have been. 
[00:38:30]  Literally.  We all knew Mushmouth would get it.  Well, Halle Berry had to get out there and praise Lena Horne.  Lena Horne.  Breaking down the black barriers and stuff.  I was so pissed with the death montage.  Were you?  Yeah, because they got fucking a song going on.  Well, we've talked about how you love to applaud for your favorite dead guy.  Yeah.  And there was no, you noticed there was no applause.  No applause.  That's what got me pissed.  They must have told that whole audience, please, whatever you do, do not applaud the dead people. 
[00:39:00]  Because it's like.  That used to be my favorite part.  You see who's the greatest dead person of the year.  Who they really would have.  Who's more important than the other dead guy.  Like a fucking, you know, a lighting tech.  Right.  A smattering.  They'll get a smattering.  But Dennis Hopper would have gotten fucking woo.  That would have gone great.  I saw your tweet.  That's what I thought.  He should have got the biggest applause.  And then they got Celine Dion singing that smile song. 
[00:39:30]  Celine Dion singing.  Which is the most depressing song ever.  Yeah.  It's like, it's already depressing in a way because they're going for that moment.  You know?  And then they have her.  It's like, okay, well, if we all cry, will you stop this nonsense?  Smile till your heart is breaking.  And then Norm tweets, should we really be smiling?  And then he also tweeted, these people are dead, but she's alive?  Talking about Celine Dion.  Yeah.  It was, it was great.  And then Lena Horne was the special dead person. 
[00:40:00]  Lena Horne.  She didn't make the montage because the montage was over.  Then Halle Berry comes out to praise Lena Horne for breaking down the barriers.  Yeah.  And Halle Berry's half white, first of all, and Jewish.  Yep.  And Lena Horne is barely black, too.  When they played that black and white footage of Lena Horne, she was genuinely pale.  Right.  She was white.  She broke down the barrier for people that are sort of black.  Right.  That's what I tweeted.  That's it.  She didn't break down the door for black people. 
[00:40:30]  No.  She broke down the door for people that are sort of black.  Not like Sidney Poitier.  You don't got, you don't got a ton of precious broads out there because the one broke down  the barrier, right?  Yep.  You got the ones that are comfortable for white people to look in.  Yeah.  That's a fact, though.  Right?  Oh, hell yeah.  I'm just looking at the, it says, was host James Franco awkward, nervous, or just stoned? 
[00:41:00]  That is the story everyone's running with on the blogs.  I wouldn't go awkward.  Yeah, they should go scared, though.  Scared?  Was he scared?  He absolutely was scared.  He was a little petrified.  He was petrified, and maybe he took a little something to try to relax the nerves.  Those writers, by the way, they should find who wrote those stuff, and they literally  should have their writing hands put through a buzzsaw.  That fucking weak, corny shit.  Hi, Mom!  Sit down, Grandma!  The writers were shot by the network firing squad.  Were there even any writers? 
[00:41:30]  You have to wonder.  Yeah, did they just bail?  Of course there were, but, I mean, really?  Yeah.  Who wants to put their name behind those jokes?  They were terrible.  All right, when we get back in, let's do the Kirk Douglas.  Oh, yeah.  And other things, we had a busy show, man.  We should do a...  Really busy.  What?  Kirk or Dick.  It should be a game.  Kirk or Dick.  Not a bad idea.  Because I couldn't tell the difference sometimes.  Do we have the latest Dick Clark audio laying around somewhere?  I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  You might be able to tell by the crowd yelling, though, behind Dick Clark.  I'll be, yeah.  But I want to just compare the two to see who's...  Compare the two.  ...who's doing a little better.  See what happens.  Yeah.  At least Kirk has an excuse.  He's 95.  Oh, my God.  Who gets that contract?  Not many of us.  But the past few years have not been good ones.  You're 95, but it's not like he's fucking, you know...  I think he leveled off since he turned 80.  Just kind of leveled off.  Wow.  But can I say one thing?  Because I'm looking at a clip.  Bob Hoke, Hope, Bogart, Bing, and Cary Grant and Brando. 
[00:42:30]  It's funny when old people write stuff about, like, the old days of TV.  Some of the comments on the YouTube.  Real classic.  When TV was real.  Yeah, that's when it was real.  Leave it to Beaver and my favorite, Martian.  It's like, TV can't stink.  But I'm also tired of people glorifying the old days when not one real subject was fucking touched.  Watching that fucking 4-3 piece of shit television.  TV's more real now than it's ever been.  I mean, with reality TV, like it or not, it's a lot more realistic than fucking what it used to be.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Sure.  My whole statement.  Real stars.  Although the sitcoms suck.  Most of them do, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, we'll break.  Do some Kirk Douglas and other stuff after this.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  And now, here's Oscar.  Nominated for eight Academy Awards, including performance by an actor in a leading role, directing, and best picture. 
[00:43:30]  The Social Network.  Presented by Patrice O'Neill and Rich Voss.  Let me rephrase this.  I sent my clients 16 emails.  The first 15, you didn't raise any concerns.  Is that a question?  In the 16th email, you raised concern about the site's functionality.  Were you leading them on for six weeks or something?  No.  Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before?  It's raining.  I'm sorry?  It just started raining.  Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?  No.  Do you think I deserve it? 
[00:44:00]  What?  Do you think I deserve your full attention?  I had a swear and oath before we began this desposition.  Oh, wait, hold on.  I had a swear and oath before we began this.  Look, I had a swear and oath.  I had a swear and oath before we began this deposition.  I had a swear and oath before we began this deposition.  And I don't want to perjure myself.  So I had the legal obligation to say no.  Okay, no.  You don't think I deserve your full attention.  I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall, they have the right to give it a try. 
[00:44:30]  But there's no requirement for me to enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.  You have part of my attention.  You have part of my attention.  You have the minimum amount.  And the rest of my attention is back at the office of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intelligently or creatively capable of doing.  Did I adequately answer your condescending question?  Now, go fuck yourself. 
[00:45:00]  Stay tuned for more Oscar moments presented by The Opie and Anthony Show.  Trent Reznor wins an Oscar last night.  Wow.  That's kind of strange, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, the music and social network was great.  You remember Trent as the Nine Inch Nails guy. 
[00:45:30]  I want to fuck you like an animal.  Talk about fisting and shit, fist fuck.  And there he is in a suit and going up there and accepting an award like he's Hollywood royalty.  Kind of looked a little corporate.  He certainly did.  But you know what?  Good for him.  I hate this song, even though I know it's...  I've never gotten to Nine Inch Nails.  Nine Inch Nails, they have some good songs.  I know.  They're very popular.  I just never...  Yeah, this was good shit. 
[00:46:00]  What does the Drudge Report have there, Jimmy?  We're doing a little Oscars wrap-up here.  It's like one of the headlines is,  Actress Drops F-Bomb on Broadcast TV at 8.45.  And it's like, I like Drudge, but I'm kind of tired of them trying to make news.  Yeah.  And it's like, you know what?  That's not news.  And she didn't drop the F-Bomb officially.  They got it.  Oh, they got it?  Of course they got it.  At 8.45?  They got it. 
[00:46:30]  All you heard was, like, a little shock after the beep.  It's really like old lady website Drudge at this point.  Stop trying to create and make news.  This is what he's talking about.  Okay.  Yeah, I am kind of speechless.  Golly sakes, there's people up there, too.  When I watched Kate two years ago, it looked so... 
[00:47:00]  See, they just fucking cut it out.  Yeah.  So, Drudge, what are you doing?  No one dropped an F-Bomb.  No.  Not on TV, at least not here.  Even if you went, oh, my fucking God.  Like, who cares?  She didn't drop the F-Bomb officially, because we didn't hear it.  The British version is right here, because they don't care about language.  You can cut us on TV.  Okay. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I am kind of speechless.  Golly sakes, there's people up there, too.  When I watched Kate two years ago, it looked so fucking easy.  Oops.  See?  It's not going to hurt anybody.  If that would...  Oh, my God.  8.45.  I'm really fucking offended now.  Is this live right now?  Or taped or whatever?  For eight years, and I could, like, take a few shots back, I didn't know you were going 
[00:48:00]  to take your little ball and go home and punish everybody in the process.  But it's Sheen's character that has come into question time and time again.  Smoke's where he wants.  The one thing I'm finding about you is that you seem really nice.  You seem like you love your children.  Yeah, man.  I'm the nicest guy you want to make.  But then you hear about this violent side.  Yeah, it's obvious.  When you're talking about...  Are these women making this up?  Yeah, yeah.  Or is this really happening?  Tell us, you know, what really happened in that house in Aspen?  What really happened in that hotel room in New York City?  I can't do that right here, because that means I have to expose people.  And regardless of, you know, what tomfool or heirs skullduggery they rolled in with, I 
[00:48:30]  can't do that.  I don't roll people.  Were you violent?  No.  No, it's not.  So why did they say you were violent?  I don't know, because they were making stuff up.  Instead of the source, they're going to...  And everybody takes their word over mine?  Do you have a violent side at all?  Now, today, when it's needed to protect my family, absolutely.  And it's unlike anything you'll ever see.  Are there any drugs in this house?  To my best knowledge, no.  No drugs in the house right now? 
[00:49:00]  Not that I know about.  If I know about them, I'll find them and throw them away.  It's not a big deal.  Ooh, drugs in the house.  What about the people who supply you with drugs?  Are they out of your life?  I, I, I, again, I cannot speak about things that, um, that are sort of, you know...  Terminating?  I just, that's really nobody's business.  I think you know the answer to that, you know.  Are you willing to take a drug test?  Sure, you got a cup?  I mean, I got nothing to hide.  And, uh, there are some reports this morning that Charlie Sheen could be suing for more 
[00:49:30]  than 300 million dollars.  The fucking...  It's unwatchable.  They had Sheen interview exclusive in front of his face during the entire interview.  While he's talking, you could see from his nose up, his mouth.  These lazy, lazy motherfuckers in television.  Laugh with people off the set, which I presume to be...  He, uh, wow, he doesn't look good at all.  That's terrible. 
[00:50:00]  He looks horrendous.  Dude, you're watching, and they're advertising themselves in the guy's face.  Yeah.  Who the fuck runs network television?  It's horrendous.  Here's a little more.  This is their family.  It may be unconventional, but it seems to work for them.  He calls them the goddesses?  The goddesses.  He calls them his wedge.  It's, they're a huge part of his life.  They were approving everything and going over everything with him and, you know, just really  there for him.  Okay.  Well, you're going to have a lot more later in our next half hour, also on 2020 tomorrow 
[00:50:30]  night, a special edition.  And in that next half hour...  Whatever.  Obviously, you got the exclusive.  I mean, you're not going to find Charlie on any other channel today, so you don't need  the big exclusive thing over his face.  I think there is a problem, though, with exclusivity.  Like, NBC's got it.  Right.  And ABC's got it.  They gave it to...  He gave interviews to everyone, but it's CBS.  Except CBS.  I said, fuck you, CBS.  Yeah.  Yeah, that situation's just... 
[00:51:00]  I don't know.  Is he sober?  He looks...  He might be sober, yeah.  He looks crazy.  Some people say maybe he is sober, and he's just out of his mind because he is sober.  He looks crazy.  You know, it's been a while.  Looks a little manic.  Yeah.  Right?  He does.  A little manic.  He's all over the place.  He looks really thin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He sounds bad.  He sounds like he's smoking, obviously, so it's...  I like that he just lit up during an interview.  I love guys that do that.  Yeah, because you know he basically can't smoke anywhere anymore.  I think that was his house, probably. 
[00:51:30]  He probably invited him to his house.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Smoking his own goddamn house.  Pretty much blew the smoke right in her face.  He didn't give a fuck.  He don't care.  Well, we'll have more Charlie Sheen audio from the big 2020 interview, I guess.  I guess that's the 2020 interview.  They're just playing a clip or two?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right, and Kirk Douglas at the Oscars.  This was the highlight.  Well, you know, they brought him out relatively early in the Oscars.  I guess he had to go to bed or something.  With a bathroom.  Had to go to fucking take a dirt nap. 
[00:52:00]  And when he came out, I was like, no, no.  Was he in some big, in case of bomb, break glass?  Like, the hosts were sucking.  So it's like, all right, bring out the corpse.  Let him walk out.  He had a little cane.  Yeah.  When they said Kirk Douglas, I was like, no.  No.  No.  And he actually gave out an award.  And then he didn't know when to leave the stage. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, they were trying to lead him away from the podium.  He didn't want to leave.  At one point, it looked like he thought it was his own birthday party or something.  Yeah.  They were all there for him or something.  And then the poor, dumb nominees are sitting there waiting for him to open the envelope  and say something.  And he just kept going, oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  And then he keeps talking and talking.  And they're just like, announce this fucking thing already. 
[00:53:00]  Exactly.  Oh, it looks terrible.  The clips they're showing just look terrible.  Of what?  They did a little montage of some of the silly things James Franco and Anne Hathaway were doing.  Oh, yes.  Awful.  How god awful.  Charming.  They were charming.  They were.  They were terrific.  Some of the awards annoyed me, too.  They gave them, too.  Yeah.  Fucking.  King's Speech, I think, first was great.  Best Picture.  Did you see?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  Best Picture. 
[00:53:30]  Come on.  We got it.  You beat the odds.  Cut.  You were the king.  Oscar loves when you beat the odds, though.  Fuck you.  Of course that movie was going to win.  I thought Inception was weird, but that should have got best screenplay over.  How the fuck did the King's Speech get best original screenplay?  That annoyed me so much.  It was just a story of a guy who fucking, who couldn't say his PH words or whatever the  fuck it was, and then he talks.  Mumbles McGillicuddy. 
[00:54:00]  Exactly.  And it wasn't important in history, because we never really heard of this guy until this  year.  I mean, sure, some of you historians out there, but the average schmoes, we didn't  know this guy.  It wasn't important enough for us to know about him.  Well done film, but come on.  Best Director.  Stop it.  There weren't a lot of great films this year, though, when it comes down to it.  Black Swan was really weird.  It was good.  I thought Natalie Portman deserved it.  She was fucking fantastic.  She was a shoo-in, as they said.  Yeah, that was great.  They knew she was going to win.  She was truly nuts in that fucking movie, man. 
[00:54:30]  All shot with close-up.  Aronofsky shot that so weird.  It almost wanted you to feel crazy and claustrophobic, because every shot was in close-up.  Yeah, that's his style.  To make you feel very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And Mila Kunis.  Oh, she was great.  Hot.  Yeah.  Hot.  Mila Kunis.  Hot.  She's really hot, but she has negative ass.  Oh, no.  It goes in.  Yeah, she really doesn't have an ass at all.  I used to be into her until I saw that.  None ass.  That took you out of it?  Oh, completely.  I know you're an ass man. 
[00:55:00]  Completely.  You like the ass.  I'm a big fan of that Winter's Bone chick now.  Yeah.  The blonde in the red dress.  I gotta tell you, that Scarlett Johansson's still...  Still up there?  Still right up there.  She had the hair like she just got out of bed.  Yeah.  She had some messy hair.  She messed it up for the Oscars.  Yeah.  She had some messy hair.  She had a nice dress that you could kind of see through.  Hey, if you had sex with Hilary Swank, would you be considered gay at this point? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You would, right?  Yeah, that's...  I just want to get that out there.  Because we were all looking at her and going, what the fuck, man?  But she has great traps.  I wonder what exercise she's doing.  I could use some better traps.  What the fuck is that?  That is no ass.  That's her no ass.  Oh, that's terrible.  And her no ass.  A no ass and a small ass.  A small and flat.  You could tell there's nothing there.  Like, her back goes straight into her ass.  Her lower back. 
[00:56:00]  And her fucking shorts are just hanging there.  Right.  They're like boxer shorts that are hanging.  They don't know what to do.  There's nothing to cling to.  To fill up this area right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's got to fill that up, right?  She should take a dump in her pants to fill up that bottom area that's missing.  It would look better.  She looked like she was going to have a boob pop out at any moment last night, though.  She was wearing those nippy guards.  Yeah.  Those flowery things that chicks stick on their nips.  She's pretty hot, though, Danny.  Come on.  Of course.  I'm not saying, like, I wouldn't fucking hit it.  Her face is ridiculous. 
[00:56:30]  It would always bother me that she didn't have an ass.  Yeah.  Like, if me now was with Mila, like, Mila Kunis was still Mila Kunis, I would still be like,  I don't know what she's going to want.  Is that her sort of showing a boob?  Second row down?  Second picture?  Yeah.  Let me see that.  Oh, no.  It was deceiving.  I saw her in person when they did that family guy at Carnegie, and she was smoking hot.  Yeah.  Smoking.  Was she good in Black Swan?  I don't even know. 
[00:57:00]  I didn't see.  I didn't see Black Swan.  She was sexy as fucking hell in Black Swan.  Mila Kunis was very sexy in that movie.  She was great, too.  All right.  We're stalling.  Here's Kirk Douglas from last night.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And I want to thank James.  Thank you.  He looks much better out of the cave.  And I want to thank Ms. Hathwoody. 
[00:57:30]  I thank you.  Ms. Hathwoody?  I want to thank Ms. Hathwoody.  Well, Amy Franco and Ms. Attaway, they look much better in the cave.  What was he saying?  I don't know if it was a Batman joke.  No, he looks much better out of the cave because he was in that 27 hours.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  So that was where that came from.  All right.  Well, he's killing with those jokes.  I thank you.  She's gorgeous.  Wow. 
[00:58:00]  What were you when I was making pictures?  Pictures.  Pictures.  She was 20 years away from being born.  Making pictures.  What would you have done with her anyway?  Yeah, really?  Fucked her mouth in the trailer.  Look at her and drop dead.  Where were you when I was making pictures?  Frankenstein.  Why do they have to cart him out? 
[00:58:30]  I know.  Can't they just mail him an award and say thanks?  He didn't even get an award.  He didn't get an award.  What did he do?  He presented something.  Like any schlub.  Yeah.  He took someone's spot.  Oh.  That's good.  I have something to confess.  I just shit myself.  I love telling this woman.  And I'm crazy about beautiful woman.  All right.  I'll give 20 bucks to anyone that could tell me what he just said. 
[00:59:00]  No problem.  I like something woman.  I'm crazy about beautiful woman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what annoys you is Anne Hathaway is fanning herself in the back.  Yeah.  Like she's got the vapors.  Which probably just means that his shit fumes are hitting her.  He fucking.  I bet you right now he has liquid shit dripping into his fucking older gentleman's socks.  He's actually.  You know the little things that hold your socks up?  Yeah.  Those garters.  Those sock garters.  Those sock garters have shit behind them and they're slipping down.  His socks were all bunched up.  Thank God he's got them on because they're kind of holding the shit back a little from just dripping off onto his shoes. 
[00:59:30]  And she's smelling his shit wafting at her.  You think he can keep his breath together at this age?  His breath?  No.  What do you think that smells like, Jimmy?  It probably smells like the Grim Reaper's feet.  Effortant.  It's horrible denture breath.  It's terrible.  How good could it be?  It's fucking awful.  Oh, shit.  And he's had facelifts, which makes it just weird.  Has he?  Yes.  Look how tight his face looks up top.  I don't know.  Is that facelift?  He had his eyes pulled back.  I know what he said. 
[01:00:00]  I love thyroid women and crazy about beautiful women.  Because thyroid women are like kind of are sexy and saucy women.  That's the old school.  I think he loves thalidomide women.  Oh, falalala.  That's what he's saying.  Falalala.  Look at those earlobes. 
[01:00:30]  What the fuck?  That's just crazy.  Giant melting earlobes.  I know your ears continue to grow your entire life, but wow.  Do they?  Yeah, your ears and your nose.  Oh, that's great.  Your nose?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, look at old people, man.  They got big fucking ears and big fucking noses.  Oh, that's crazy.  That's a big earlobe.  He looks like he was...  What did you say about his earlobe?  You had a good tweet about his earlobe last night.  Oh, oh, I said, I wonder if you could take his earlobe and press it on a newspaper and 
[01:01:00]  pick up the picture.  I called him hashtag old silly putty ears.  It looks like silly putty.  Because the way he was moving, too, it was jiggling and jostling.  It looks like he took out those big rings that the hipsters wear in their fucking ears.  It looks like he still has a man.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  And now I'm going to give you five of them. 
[01:01:30]  The anomaly for best actress.  Did he say talented women?  I don't know.  I know he said anomaly.  Oh, maybe.  He's going to read the anomalies.  The anomalies?  He's going to read the anomalies.  I heard that.  They should have given him really hard words on purpose.  And subsequently, and henceforth, and in conclusion.  Yeah, and then they have Francis Ford Coppola and a few of the other guys up there, and 
[01:02:00]  they weren't allowed to speak.  They didn't say anything.  But he's, but Kirk can just fucking ramble on as long as he wants.  They had Tuco from fucking Good to Bad and the Ugly come out.  They sure did.  And he was, oh my God, ancient.  He was that dead color.  Like that fucking, it looks like, it looks like miraculously, even though all three of  them were on camera, that they didn't white balance the camera properly for him.  He was like that yellowish death color.  Eli Wallach?  Yeah.  How old is he, though?  But he was in, he was good in actually in, uh. 
[01:02:30]  He was in some movies.  In Wall Street 2.  No, no, no, the Wall Street 2.  Yes, Wall Street 2 he was in that.  He was in Wall Street 2, yeah.  He was the old, old guy who was, uh.  I still haven't seen that movie.  It's actually better than I thought it would be.  I didn't, it wasn't, you know, an award winner, but it was okay.  Yeah.  And he was great in that.  He played one of the high, like the head, the head finance guys, whatever.  Seriously.  He was good.  He looked like he didn't know where he was last night.  Uh, 19, holy shit, I think we're going with 1915.  Oh my God.  85, 96. 
[01:03:00]  Another 95 year old.  Jesus.  Possibly 96.  No, 96 at the end of the year.  Like born right after the Titanic sunk.  It's fucked up, man.  Oh, speaking of which, fuck.  Remember Pat Cooper was in on Friday?  A little side thing really fast.  And remember he was talking about how when he was 14, he was banging a 50 year old?  Yeah.  And it's one of his regrets because he told his friends in the neighborhood and she had  to move?  Yeah.  Someone after the show, and I wish we fucking thought about this while Pat was in here. 
[01:03:30]  We were talking to a guy that banged a woman that was born in the 1800s.  Someone did the math after the show and his tweet blew me away.  I'm like, holy shit.  Because he was 14 and he's 82, right?  Right.  So that's 68 years ago.  And she was 50 at the time.  All right.  So what year were we talking?  Well, I think he said on the show it was in the 40s.  Yeah.  She was born in the 1890s.  Yeah.  She was like 1880 something, 1890 something. 
[01:04:00]  18 anything is fucking old.  So we were listening to a guy talk about how he was banging a bra that was definitely  born in the late 1800s.  Fuck.  That's kind of weird, right?  Fuck yeah.  Pussy smelled like slavery.  Mint, juleps, and sad people.  But maybe his math doesn't add up because he said in the 40s, but he's 82.  I don't know.  I'll do the math during the break and make sure it's accurate.  More Kirk Douglas.  The nominee for Best Actress Supported Actress Award. 
[01:04:30]  Well, here they are.  Amy Adams.  Hey, when the Oscars does this and they bring out a Kirk Douglas, what emotion are we supposed  to feel?  I feel just bummed out.  Like, what are they going for?  Yeah, it's a drag.  Because can't they just bring him out and let the place, you know, give him a standing  ovation and then he walks his ass backstage or something? 
[01:05:00]  Oh, God.  Like, what are they going for there?  I don't know.  Look at his eyebrows.  He started talking to the audience and it just was, oh, God.  I think I missed it, though, because I have a pounding erection.  And I don't think that's what they were going for.  From the minute he sauntered out there, I've had a fucking fist in my underpants.  He's like pointing at you, Jackman.  And what was he saying?  It was like, you know, you're not laughing, but he's laughing. 
[01:05:30]  And it was just sad.  No one's laughing because we can't understand you.  You know what, Danny?  Why pop up Kirk Douglas from an old movie that he was in?  Why?  And let's compare.  Why are you doing this?  Because.  Why?  Why?  Because I want to see what fucking father time does to people.  We all know what father time does.  Nah, let's hear him talking like Kirk Douglas did.  Oh, I see what you mean.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a movie clip.  When did he have his, when did half of his face take a vacation? 
[01:06:00]  Never returned.  Half of his face just packed up bags in the middle of the night and left.  Half of his face retired.  Yeah, half of his face just went to the fucking Bahamas.  Damn.  Half of his face is playing golf.  Full time.  This is Kirk Douglas.  It's Harry James.  What are we going to play?  I don't know.  How about get happy?  Okay, but I ain't.  You start us moving.  Let's see what happens.  Your answer won't be far off.  It's a terrible movie.  Oh, doesn't it?  And now they're just going to play music. 
[01:06:30]  Who the fuck would watch this?  Five white guys in suits.  What was it?  Playing jazz.  Didn't he play a gladiator or something?  Oh, yeah.  What was his big role?  Wasn't he in Spartacus?  Spartacus, right?  Okay.  I think it was in Spartacus.  With Tony Curtis.  With Tony Curtis in Spartacus.  Weren't they bathing together?  No, it was very gay.  Very homoerotic.  Get that scene so we can all get turned out.  Spartacus.  Here's Kirk Douglas.  Huh?  Do you want the bathing scene?  Oh, yeah.  We so want the bathing scene.  Where's the bathing scene?  If you find the bathing scene.  We can just talk about bathing together. 
[01:07:00]  Tony Curtis.  Well, Tony Curtis.  The only time he bathes is when an orderly decides his time.  Dunks him.  Some old black orderly fucking puts his old man head under the water and dunks him.  You're half a face.  All right.  You were terrible last night at the Oscars.  You ruined him, motherfucker.  Punch to the spine.  Fred Tuck in Indianapolis did the math. 
[01:07:30]  Pat Cooper born in 1929.  The chick would be 36 at the time of Pat Cooper's birth.  Oh, okay.  So she would have been born in 1893.  1893.  So he was talking about a girl he banged.  Woman.  Wow.  That was born in 1893.  That is fucking weird.  Yeah.  That is really strange.  Her asshole smelled like Lincoln's top hat.  Fucking wooden dentures.  First time she ever got splinters was in Washington. 
[01:08:00]  Ate her asshole.  Why?  I'm back for an hour.  It's already there.  Why not?  I know, but why can't I just grow up and change?  It's good shit.  Asshole eating splinter jokes.  Boo.  All right.  Here's Kirk doing some material before announcing the winner.  You know, now is the moment.  The moment that we are all waiting for.  And he dies?  Yeah.  Hugh Jackman is laughing. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know why everybody in Australia thinks I'm funny.  I don't know why everybody in Australia thinks he's funny.  Because half his face went down under.  He's just mean.  You couldn't wait, though.  Would that be great if Hugh Jackman said,  No, I'm just laughing because no one understands what you're saying. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  You old fuck.  Yeah, you said nomalies.  It's nominees.  Nomalies.  How about this?  If you can't say nominees, you don't present an award.  They should have tested him with fucking backstage.  And every time he got it wrong, they step on his foot really hard.  Hit him with a cattle prod.  Yeah.  And his old knees.  His knees have fucking turkey neck.  Wait.  Do you think I would ruin my career if I was backstage and I met him and I assaulted him?  Just punch him in the face so hard, his little jaw breaks. 
[01:09:30]  For no reason.  For no reason.  Other than just to be a tough guy.  Oh, God.  To be a tough guy.  To work on some MMA moves.  All right.  Kubrick did Spartacus.  Well, the first is not laughing.  He's British.  What the hell?  They just explode.  These two laughter.  Any type of sound. 
[01:10:00]  Because they're uncomfortable.  He's British.  They're uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Is he?  They're just uncomfortable.  Because they all want to go, a monster!  It lives!  It was horribly uncomfortable to watch.  God bless him.  Yeah.  He didn't make it that long, but when did he have the stroke?  Did someone say, I don't know?  It's got to be at least 10 years at this point.  Oh, okay.  It has to be.  Right?  8 to 10, I would say.  8 to 10 years ago?  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  This is the moment.  If I get a good, you know.  He kept delaying.  Huh?  He kept delaying.  Yeah, he was getting big glass for that.  What was going on?  He knew what he was doing there.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  He knew everyone was anxious, and he said, fuck that.  I'm going to have a little fun with this moment.  Sorry, Jim.  No, I was actually going to say something that probably would have got me in trouble. 
[01:11:00]  Can you whisper it?  It's got an N-word in it.  Oh.  Oh, right.  You're still laughing.  Cold and first is laughing.  You know, I will never forget this moment.  Do you think it would have gotten a big laugh out if somebody walked out in a Grim Reaper 
[01:11:30]  outfit and just beckoned to him?  It would have gotten a zero from the audience with a big sickle.  He slowly comes out from the wing and then just beckons him with that one finger going, come  on.  It either would have gotten a zero or the biggest laugh in Oscar history.  Why don't they do that with a really old person one time? 
[01:12:00]  And then he just turns and looks and sees him and goes, ah, and tries to run away.  All right.  How long are they going to make this sketch?  And you've got them doing tricks?  And then the Grim Reaper pushes him into a hole?  I just like that he's very scared of him.  Three times and I lost every time. 
[01:12:30]  But now we have a winner.  And the Oscar for supporter access goes to me, Melissa Leo, the fighter.  The spider?  Marissa.  Oh, the fighter.  Yeah.  I thought he said spider and I thought.  The spider.  I thought he said Marissa Theo. 
[01:13:00]  I don't know what he said.  Her name's Melissa Leo, but I guess they figured it out.  They had to figure it out themselves.  I thought it was a Christmas card to him.  I'd say you want to get your Oscar, your big moment.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  She'll forever have to play it for her family and go, yeah, this is my moment when I got  the Oscar.  Marissa Bear, the spider.  It's like, what the fuck?  The verbal equivalent of fucking marbles just falling out of his mouth.  But, you know, maybe it is kind of cool to get an Oscar from Kirk Douglas, though. 
[01:13:30]  Well, maybe years ago.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I guess it would still be cool.  I don't know.  He's got to be the oldest in Hollywood.  She kissed him.  Did she?  She kissed her, yeah.  Yeah.  He kissed her.  What am I saying?  I can't even get it right.  I've got all kinds of homosexuality going on.  He didn't seem nervous, though.  I guess, you know.  Well, he's been in the game a while, I guess.  Why would he be nervous?  He could be dead tomorrow.  Do we have any of that Spartacus, because Danny found some Spartacus when he was fucking  Spartacus? 
[01:14:00]  Just the Trello.  Trello?  Any talking?  You just can't find him, huh?  There's a little talking.  Look at him.  He was all man back then.  He'd kick your ass.  The symbol of the Senate.  All the power of Rome.  Ah, he broke it.  I imagine a god for slaves.  And I pray.  What do you pray for?  An early death.  I pray for a son who'll be born free. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know if I like his acting.  No.  They were all like that back then.  Yeah, that's from that era.  He was over the top.  I know I don't like my own, so before anybody says that.  That's terrible.  Before his brain took a fucking blood bath.  Exactly.  Before my brain looks like a fucking tomato that you left in the microwave for too long.  Oh, God.  Makes it like a kabushka.  Hey, guys.  Matt in North Carolina has a great line.  Oh, cool, cool.  Great line for Matt coming up here.  Hey, Matt. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  I couldn't believe it when I saw that Grim Reaper coming out on the stage.  I'm stroking to us.  No, I'm stroking to us.  What's that, bro?  Your phone cut out.  Ah, well.  Strokes.  Spartacus.  Make it work.  Dude, I don't know.  We didn't hear you.  You said Kirk Douglas came out.  What are you talking about?  What do you got?  AT&T?  Okay.  He hung out.  He knew.  He knew he was hung out to dry.  How could he not? 
[01:15:30]  That fucking joke actually was a big black circle with a little wick on the top of it.  Oh, my.  Holy mackerel.  What, you don't like that?  Oh, it's seven-gram rocks and finishing them because that's how I roll.  I have one speed.  I have one gear.  Go.  How do you survive that?  Because I'm me.  Because I'm me.  I'm different.  I just have a different constitution.  I have a different brain.  I have a different heart.  I have a different, you know, I get tiger blood, man.  You don't worry that you're going to die when you take that many drugs?  Dying is for fools. 
[01:16:00]  But you're only human.  No, there's certain blends I will not entertain because that's how people go down.  I'm too smart to do that.  Oh, boy.  You know, I'm sorry for the guys that that happened to.  But, you know, he should have read the directions before he showed up at the party, you know.  So you actually have a strategy about how you take your drugs?  No, I just have a couple of rules.  I don't know if it's a strategy.  You're clean right now.  Sure.  So is this better now?  Your life now?  Clean with your children?  Yeah.  No, it's perfect.  It's not better than being on drugs.  It's perfect.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  No, it doesn't compare.  They're whole different realities, you know. 
[01:16:30]  There's great things about both.  But what I'm harnessing now is absolute, you know, focus.  It's exciting.  It's exciting.  I've come back from a place that, you know, people can put labels on it and they can figure  all this stuff out.  They can try to, like, normalize it, normalize it.  Boring, stupid, you know.  And that's fine.  But for me, I've just answered to a higher calling and it happened in the blink of an  eye.  And I'm totally excited by it, you know.  Are you worried you're going to relapse?  No. 
[01:17:00]  Why?  Because I'm not going to.  Period.  The end.  But how do you know?  I blinked and I blinked and I cured my brain.  That's how.  Everybody has the power.  It's because everybody here, you know, can't is the cancer of happen.  Can't is the cancer of happen.  I can't do it.  The Nike slogan doesn't say, just try it.  Oh, okay.  Just try it.  No, just do it, man.  But you love to party.  I mean, what's not to love?  How do you.  Especially when you see how I partied, man.  It was epic.  The run I was on made Sinatra, Flynn, Jagger, Richards, all of them just look like, you know, 
[01:17:30]  droopy-eyed, armless children.  When you look back at the last time you used drugs, are you disgusted with yourself?  Or do you think, how could I have done that?  I'm proud of what I've created.  It was radical.  You're proud of that party moment?  Of course.  Why wouldn't I be?  Why would you be?  Because I expose people to magic.  I expose them to something they're never otherwise going to see in their boring, normal lives.  And I gave that to them.  I may forget about them tomorrow, but they'll live with that memory for the rest of their  lives.  And that's a gift, man.  One of the women said that she was afraid she might OD. 
[01:18:00]  One of the women who was here.  What's that got to do with me?  You're showing them the party.  I just, you know, that's got nothing to do with me.  That's all on her.  And if she does, I'm sorry.  You say that you like the feeling of being on drugs and it's exciting and fun.  Not anymore.  I bored the hell out of me after a while.  I was like, okay, let's try something else.  How can anyone believe that you will stay clean, given your track record?  I'm not interested in what people believe.  I'm interested in what I believe, and I believe in the truth.  And that's what rules me. 
[01:18:30]  And Charlie Sheen did end up taking that drug test while we were in his home.  He passed the urine test, but also took a more comprehensive blood test that would reveal if even more drugs were taken.  Okay, Andrew, thanks very much.  We want to get to that right now.  Joining me is Dylan Howard.  He's the senior executive editor at Radar Online.  He was there with Charlie Sheen when the actor took the more comprehensive drug test.  And Dylan, tell us how this all came about and exactly what test Charlie was given.  Well, good morning to you, George.  This came about after we were confronted with speculation from those who were seeking answers as to why Charlie Sheen went on these radio rants, if you like. 
[01:19:00]  I confronted him.  I asked him whether or not he was prepared to undergo a drug test.  He said he would if, when he passed, that I would drink his urine as a mark of a man, if you like.  Of course, that was a joke, and that never went to fruition.  But he did agree.  In fact, he even flew back from the Bahamas, where he was vacationing, to take this test earlier than expected. 
[01:19:30]  He was so confident that he would pass.  And, George, not even Charlie Sheen knows the results of this drug test.  Right, and we were just showing the blood.  We were just showing the blood being drawn.  What more can you tell us about to take the test?  Well, this was done by a court-certified laboratory here in California.  A company that he's certified to practice in five states and is a member of the prestigious college, I should say, of American Pathology. 
[01:20:00]  It was undertaken on Saturday afternoon.  They took two tests.  They took a urine test, and they also took a blood test, the results of which took 24 hours to compile.  And this comprehensive report right here details the results that America wants to know.  And you tested for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, alcohol.  What did you find?  The blood test tested for a grid of 10 drugs, the urine a grid of 9.  And the good news for Charlie Sheen, as he's watching this at home, I can tell you that right now, is that he tested negative for every single one of those tests. 
[01:20:30]  So negative.  No drugs in his system at all, according to this urine and blood test.  And that means, you know, we check with some experts as well.  That means he is likely clean for at least a few days.  This is good for, what, the urine test for two or three days, maybe the blood test just a little bit longer?  So who cares?  No, in fact, the blood test only goes for a window of around about 24 hours. 
[01:21:00]  But it's a more complex test and looks deeper into the system.  The urine, on the other hand, tests for some 72 hours.  But this is a big win for Charlie Sheen.  Make no mistake, he flew home early to confront these allegations.  People thought that he was using in the Bahamas.  By the way, the next person in this country that complains about airport security,  you should have your fucking head lopped off.  Again, I know Charlie volunteered for this, and it's like, he's an adult.  But this is fucking, his drug test results reveal. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Like, what a fucking, what a bunch of nosy assholes we are.  Busy bodies.  We really are.  I like the fact that he's doing, you know what, do what the fuck you want to do, brother.  He's an adult.  If he wants to get high, I think he's kind of dumb.  But fuck it, do it.  That's pretty much where he's at.  His whole thing is like, I don't care.  Look at me.  Rockstar.  Right.  Living the life.  It's hard to argue that, you know, he had a great time.  He's not asking for help.  He looks like a lot of fucking fun.  That's what he says.  A lot of fun. 
[01:22:00]  And so the guy decided to stay sober for a few days.  Yeah.  A few days, take the test, and then fucking, whatever.  Just to kind of shove it in some people's faces that he hates right now.  I like the way he talked to that twat reporter, too.  Yeah.  With their fucking, she can't believe somebody likes it attitude.  Man, I had fun.  Enjoyed it.  Good.  Yeah.  You know what?  If you're not going to stop, then at least fucking be unapologetic.  Because it is his life, and he is an adult.  And it's like, you know what?  I think he seems like he's full of shit completely.  But go ahead, man. 
[01:22:30]  Do what you do.  He really does seem like he's just going to fall off the wagon.  He just sounds like a deluded guy.  Like a fucking really delusional guy.  He sounds like crazy.  I don't remember him being this crazy.  Yeah, he's manic.  Maybe, man.  That might be it.  Well, like you said, he had a great run.  But just the fact that they're showing a guy who's just off track.  It's such fucking nosy voice.  We love watching the wheels come off.  Yep.  And we're hoping the wheels come off. 
[01:23:00]  It's completely off.  And that's great.  Enjoy it.  But then just don't feel like a fucking McCarthyism is taking over.  Yeah.  When they want to look at the extra sketch outline of your cock at the airport.  Don't wonder why the whole country.  And don't wonder why they fucking, why some guy whose roommate is blowing people,  puts it online, and then the roommate tragically kills himself.  How did this happen?  Just don't be shocked by it.  Because everybody's a busybody.  Yeah, we're all nosy.  I guarantee there are people that, like, I want my privacy protected. 
[01:23:30]  I don't need that.  And they're the first ones yapping about this at the water cooler.  Yeah.  The proverbial water cooler.  Not a real one.  Figuratively speaking.  Yes.  It's great TV to listen to him ramble.  Fuck yeah.  I enjoy him.  He comes up with some good stuff.  Some good quotes.  He's an entertaining guy.  He's coming up with a T-shirt a day at this point.  T-shirt a day.  Right?  I'm an F-A team, bro.  Yeah.  There was a couple new ones in there that weren't bad.  Yep.  He is good.  Might as well play this into break, talking about Charlie Sheen. 
[01:24:00]  When we get back, we'll wrap up our Oscar observations, I guess.  Oscars.  And then move on to other shit.  Yeah.  Because there was a lot that happened over the weekend.  But first this.  Every year, thousands of people die of cocaine use.  We call those people losers.  Actor Charlie Sheen knows all about the positive effects cocaine can have on your life.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning, you know?  And just winning every second.  Cocaine can put you in touch with your emotions. 
[01:24:30]  My motto now is you either love or you hate.  And you must do so violently.  I don't live in the middle anymore.  That's where you get slaughtered.  That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.  Think you need AA?  Nah.  Cocaine will make you sharp enough to fix it yourself.  Debate me on AA right now.  I have a disease.  Bullshit.  I cured it with my brain, with my mind.  I'm cured.  I'm done.  There it is.  Cocaine will improve your spelling tenfold.  S-H-I-T.  You may even meet your soulmate.  I'm going to hang out with these two smoking hotties and fly privately around the world. 
[01:25:00]  You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view.  So try cocaine today.  Hey, Thomas Jefferson did it.  Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson.  He was a pussy.  Um, thanks, Charlie.  Pure and complete gnarly-isms.  Losers winning.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  And now, here's Oscar.  Nominated for ten Academy Awards including performance by an actor in a leading role, performance by an actress in a supporting role, and best picture, True Grit. 
[01:25:30]  Presented by Roland Campos and Rich Voss.  All right, Mr. Cogburn.  In four years as U.S. Marshal, how many men have you shot?  I never shot anybody.  I didn't have to.  Well, that was not to question how many.  Shot or killed.  Let us restrict you to killed so that we may have a manageable figure.  About 12, 15, stopping men in flight, defending myself, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 
[01:26:00]  Around 12, he says, or 15, so many that you cannot keep a precise count.  I've examined the records and can supply the accurate figure.  Well, I believe them two war tomes make it 23.  And how many of, and how many members of this one family, the Warren family, have you killed?  Immediate or?  Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother, and Cleet Wharton, half-brother? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, Cleet was selling Arden Spears to the Cherokees.  He come at me with a king bolt.  A king bolt?  Now you are armed and he advanced upon you with nothing more than a king bolt from a wagon tongue?  I've seen men badly torn up with things no bigger than a king bolt.  I defended myself.  Return to the other encounter with Aaron Wharton and his two remaining sons.  You sprang from cover with revolver in hand.  I did.  Loaded and cocked? 
[01:27:00]  Well, if it ain't loaded and cocked, it don't shoot.  And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed man?  Well, he was armed.  He had the axe raised.  Now, I believe you testified that you backed away from Aaron Wharton.  Which direction were you going?  I always go backwards when I'm backing up.  Stay tuned for more Oscar moments.  Presented by the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:27:30]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Follow the Opie and Anthony Show on Facebook.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, 28 years ago today, War was released by you too.  Thank you for that, Travis.  This album was pretty successful, right?  I like the War.  Yeah.  As successful as their Spider-Man Broadway play?  Pretty much.  Another delay, by the way.  I think the sixth delay of that show opening, the retooling, the script, everything. 
[01:28:00]  Everything from people fucking almost dying because they're trying to make people fly to the script sucking ass.  What's the latest delay about?  Punching up the script.  Again?  Yeah, they got to rewrite like a bunch of shit because it just sucks.  I thought someone else got hurt or something.  It's one of those things where it's just like so...  It would be so difficult logistically to pull off this guy flying around every night. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  It just doesn't work that day.  I want to see it, though.  Well, everybody wants it.  Like, what initial opening is going to be huge?  Yeah, I want to see this damn thing.  Because you're going to want to see a disaster.  Right.  You want to see the Spider-Man guy just plummet.  Honestly, if they figure it out, it would be pretty damn cool to go see.  Yes.  I don't think they'll figure it out.  I don't know if they're going to figure it out, though.  I think so either.  I'm reading headlines, news headlines, and it's driving me nuts how dishonest the mainstream media is. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  NBC, New York.  Kirk Douglas puts on the charm for Anne Hathaway.  Really?  Why can't they be honest and say it was really uncomfortable and awkward for everybody?  Is charm a new type of diaper?  He was trying to be nice.  Kirk Douglas puts on satin pillow for Anne Hathaway.  He's old.  He's old.  Acknowledge he's a Hollywood legend and all that, but it was uncomfortable. 
[01:29:30]  There was no real charm going on.  So uncomfortable.  Oh, the best and worst dressed at the Oscars.  That just came in.  Good.  Lost Duke Schneider over the weekend, huh?  What was he?  Dodgers?  Dodgers.  Brooklyn Dodgers.  One of those guys.  Brooklyn Dodgers.  84 years old.  You know, he still holds the home run record for the Dodgers.  Which Dodgers?  I think overall, though.  All the Dodgers?  All the Dodgers.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I just heard that on the news this morning.  So now you sound like an expert. 
[01:30:00]  So I just hear shit on the news, and I'm like, yeah, I'll just repeat that.  I'll do one.  Fucking Knicks beat the Heat last night.  No one was watching that game.  A couple of people were tweeting it.  It's like, what are you doing?  Get out of the game.  They finally got me, though.  Fucking Twitter.  I'm trying to concentrate on the Oscars and try to come up with something funny.  And all of a sudden, they're like, dude, the game's getting really good.  And I'm, like, getting itchy.  And I'm finally saying, oh, fuck it.  I'm going over.  And I watched, like, the last couple of minutes.  But it's weird.  The Knicks beat the Heat, but they lost to the Cavaliers. 
[01:30:30]  The last two games they played, they played the Cavaliers and lost.  Worst team in basketball, obviously, without LeBron.  So then they go and play the team that LeBron moved to and beat them.  That doesn't make sense.  So much luck involved in sports.  I'm starting to think you're right.  Just in sports in general.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  That's like a luck factor.  Miami Heat, some would argue, best team in the NBA.  Not necessarily the best record.  And then you've got the Cavaliers.  So they lose to the Cavaliers but beat one of the better teams. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  All within two days.  Two, three days.  Doesn't make any sense.  Nah.  One more Oscar observation, then we'll move on.  Christian Bale.  Why was he putting on that weird accent?  He's from England, dude.  Oh, literal Jim.  Welcome back.  But I mean, I'm just saying, the guy sounds like he's from a whole bunch of places.  Chip, he really does.  I know.  Why did Chip have to come back?  I was here early. 
[01:31:30]  I liked Jimmy.  I was here at 545.  Roland made me wait.  We got Michael Madsen coming in today.  Yeah.  Perfect day for him because he'll beat up Hollywood for everybody.  I know that much.  We love Michael Madsen.  It's been a while.  You never met him?  I've never been here when he's been in.  Kind of intimidating.  Another one of those intimidating guys.  But funny as all.  He's cool.  Yeah.  I think he's terrific.  So Christian Bale.  Yeah.  A lot of people noticed that he probably forgot his wife's name. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  That's what people are saying.  And then he kind of made it look like he was choked up.  Well, then he tried to cover it up with a tear.  He was getting emotional as he was trying to say her name.  But it was obvious he forgot or didn't want to say her name.  Yeah.  Because he said, like, my wife, and he told, I want to thank my wife.  He pointed, like.  I want to thank my wife.  And then ready to say her name.  And then he was like.  Yeah.  Another great Norm tweet was, you forgot your wife's name, but you remember Boomer? 
[01:32:30]  You remembered Boomer?  Because he's thanking all these people on his crew and staff.  He's rattling them off, too.  I want to thank everybody, Boomer.  You remember that?  Yeah.  Boomer.  But your wife's name, you seem to have forgotten your wife's name.  And why aren't you thanking the computer?  Thank the computer.  You know, that was made by a computer.  Computer.  He was obsessed with the computer.  Where's the wolf man? 
[01:33:00]  He did a good job.  He looked like a wolf man.  It was so fucking funny.  All I want to do is listen to you read Norm MacDonald.  Norm's tweets are the best.  From last night.  Yeah.  Might not make as much sense now, but definitely worth checking out sometime today if you're one of those Twitter people.  He was just, he's the king of live tweeting right now.  He's the man everyone's going after now.  If you have the Oscars DVR'd, just go to Norm, his Twitter, and just follow along with that. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, that's not a bad idea.  You would laugh your ass off.  It's really not a bad idea.  He was commenting on everything.  I don't know how he was firing him out so fast.  On every little thing that was happening, he was just nailing it.  Yeah, I just went to his Twitter again, so.  Oh, so fucking good.  Yeah, I'm trying to get one.  I mean, he must have tweeted well over 200 times last night, easily.  All right, Christian Bale for getting his wife's name. 
[01:34:00]  And, of course, mostly my wonderful wife.  I didn't think I was like this.  I thought I said, my wonderful wife, who's my mast through the storms of life.  I hope I'm likewise to you, darling.  And our little girl, who's taught me so much more than I'll ever be able to teach her.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  See, it's more of a visual, though, because he, like, and then his hand went like this, like, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  He was, like, his fucking, first of all, his beard and hair didn't match. 
[01:34:30]  No.  He looked like he was getting ready to spy on the great Danton in The Prestige.  He had to put the fake beard on and go in there.  He was going to snap a trap on some woman's hand.  It looked very odd.  But he's good, man.  They showed a clip of him from the fighter.  You didn't see the fighter?  Is that what you said?  I haven't seen any of these Oscar-nominated or won. 
[01:35:00]  Fighter was pretty good, man.  Although Marky Mark takes you out of it a little bit.  Marky Mark.  He was the producer of the film, right?  He didn't have to be in it.  I don't know, was he?  Maybe he did.  He was too polished to be a guy from Lowell.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Lowell, right?  Took place sort of in the Lowell area, which is a rough area.  Is that Southie?  No, it's northwest of Boston.  West.  Didn't we do a show there once?  Oh, yeah, we did.  It was like a fucking, at the Lowell Shit Center. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, the Lowell Shit Center.  Lowell.  We were on their billboard.  The Lowell Shit Center.  I don't know what it was.  It's such a funny name for a place.  Before the corporation started naming.  Yeah.  It was such a great name.  The Shit Center.  Yes, it's now the PNC Shit Center.  Bank.  Bank.  Bank.  I ran out of stim.  Oh, God damn, man. 
[01:36:00]  Nick Jagger looks old, man.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking 67, I want to say.  He looks every fucking minute of it.  Does he?  He's ancient.  He's had some life.  Oh, my God.  You know, it's not like he's been taking care of himself.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you see him on concert footage now.  He's still good, though.  Yeah, he could still dance around, and I'm not sure if he sings well or just sings like 
[01:36:30]  he always did.  Oh, oh, oh.  Tom will move.  You move.  You move.  Like, there's no dynamic to his voice anymore.  I don't know.  He'll do it until he's 80.  Oh, I know.  Norm MacDonald.  Finally, Al Franken wins something.  Yeah.  Some guy came up there looking like Al Franken.  And then that other guy that came up with the big fucking me in rotgut hair.  He had like the big afro. 
[01:37:00]  I just wrote hoo-hoo when he came up.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all I wrote.  I saw that one.  I just wrote hoo-hoo.  Young Howard Stern won an Oscar.  When he came up, Norm just went, nice wig.  You just have to laugh at Norm.  It was great.  Yeah.  Everything was sarcastic and just fucking.  Well, when the costume designer won.  Oh, yeah.  His tweet was, this is horse shit.  I designed those costumes.  I designed those costumes. 
[01:37:30]  I designed them.  Here's the one you referenced earlier.  I believe in Wolfmans before I believe you guys have wives.  Wolfmans, too.  He didn't say Wolfmans.  He was calling.  If he was trying to say more than one Wolfman, he called them Wolfmans.  And he beat everyone to this tweet.  When that one guy thanked his wife, he wrote, you have a wife?  Yeah.  It was so.  You have a wife?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you see the guy that thanked his boyfriend at the end of the.  No.  Yeah.  That was at the Best Picture. 
[01:38:00]  Oh.  One of the guys from.  You know what I liked about the Oscars, too, is they don't even try to, you know, put a  woman with Kevin Spacey anymore.  Oh, no, no.  Just.  He comes out singing a show tune.  Right.  Who is he singing with?  He was just came out to the podium by himself and he starts going into some song number  at the podium.  Yeah.  Some of these guys come out and they give you the illusion because they put a nice hot  broad on their arm.  Yeah.  Because they could still pull it off.  But Kevin Spacey, they're like, just go out there. 
[01:38:30]  Go out there by yourself.  Do whatever you want.  Everybody knows you eat cock sandwiches.  Side of balls.  Just go out there.  And is Gwyneth Paltrow's new fucking thing is thinking she's a singer that.  I mean, she's she's passable.  Yeah.  She's passable in a karaoke bar.  Right.  But it's like, why was Jennifer Hudson introducing her to sing?  Should have been the other way around. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Gwyneth Paltrow should have done the reading.  Should have been introduced.  Jennifer Hudson should have been doing the same because Jennifer Hudson, after she read.  Yeah.  She was proud of herself.  Like, oh, I got I read that properly.  Oh, what's an award?  Well, yeah.  But she got through it, is what I'm getting at.  You win this and we'll give out the award.  It's like, oh, could you call it an award?  I'm past the Jennifer Hudson thing.  Remember last week I was saying how hot she was?  Oh, boy.  Worst tits ever.  I said they're like looking pancake flattish. 
[01:39:30]  They were.  When they push up that cleavage and you see it's a little loosey-goosey, that is the biggest fucking turnoff.  In my humble opinion, if I may pull a Jimmy the Greek for a moment, I have not seen many African-American women with nice tits.  If they're naked in a magazine or whatever.  Or just maybe with bras on, maybe with fucking, you know, clothes.  But when you see them naked and stuff, the nipples are usually past the equator. 
[01:40:00]  They look chewed.  I don't know about chewed or anything, but they're just too, they're too, like, they're pointing down almost.  Oh, my God.  I almost did a Jimmy the Greek.  I can't even say what I was about to say.  Oh, well.  No.  I was going to, this could start an argument, but you're talking about a black woman with tits.  Yeah.  How about Oprah's?  They were very, very prevalent last night. 
[01:40:30]  They were fucking huge.  She fucking came out.  No, she didn't.  Yeah.  No, she didn't.  I'm kind of embarrassed to say, but I watched a little Oprah, and that dress she had on,  I don't know how the fuck she got in that, because she's nowhere near that size.  No.  She had some kind of corset that had to be strangling her fucking innards.  And, of course, I used the same joke.  I used 8,000 times in the past.  I just tweeted, don't worry, ladies and gentlemen, those chains are made of high tensile steel. 
[01:41:00]  She's out on stage.  Come on.  I learned something from your tweet last night.  The photographers were scaring her.  I learned something from that tweet, though.  I always thought it was tension.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's tensile.  Tensile.  I had no idea until last night.  Yeah, tensile is...  And then I had to look it up going, did he fuck that up?  It's like a hard...  Because I always thought it was tension.  Yeah, that's a stressed pencil.  Tensile.  Dude.  I'm going to be the only one that says Oprah cleaned up nice. 
[01:41:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I'm going to be the only one?  You know how sloppy those are?  She's...  She looks...  I think she looks like a mess there.  I'm the only one, then.  All I'm thinking is pussy stink.  Oh, God, yes.  And by the way, her network's tanking.  Oh, tanking.  Yeah.  It's pulling in less viewers than Discovery Health did before they replaced it.  Really?  They replaced Discovery Health with her channel.  No one cares about her dumb channel.  No.  Well, the problem is they don't have enough shows.  So they're playing a lot of crap. 
[01:42:00]  No, they're playing a lot of crap.  Is it all women they're trying to get to?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Their programming schedule is very, very thin right now.  Extremely thin.  Yeah.  Read some of the shows on there, Danny.  I didn't know the ratings were that bad.  Yeah, there's only like a hundred and some odd thousand people watching at any given moment.  No, it's funny about that.  Yeah.  It's doing so bad.  Like, Oprah kind of want to retire and sit it out and be more behind the scenes.  She's going to have to pull up a trace and come out of retirement.  She is so going to be doing a show for Owen to save it within the year. 
[01:42:30]  Mark my words.  You heard it here first.  She's got it.  She's going to have to.  I think she was thinking, well, I own this network now.  I'll do some specials here and there.  She needs a fall guy.  I think I'm thinking Logan.  Oh, fuck.  No.  No, that would be good for us.  Yeah.  Get rid of Logan.  Get rid of Logan.  Hire him here.  Hire him here.  Abso-fucking-little.  And we'd be happy again.  But great.  I'm actually writing a fucking show for the Oprah Network. 
[01:43:00]  It's like a special.  Like they do these.  It's like a show.  Yeah.  It's like a special.  Can you tell us anything about it?  It's just called The Rape of Agatha Dinsley.  It's a story about an older woman who's raped and bludgeoned in her home by her non-white neighbors. 
[01:43:30]  Agatha was very friendly.  She gave out cookies to all the kids.  And she gave out cookies to the wrong young men.  Oh, fuck.  She was found brutally raped with cookie dough covering her mouth and nose so she couldn't scream.  Agatha Dinsley.  Tinsley.  She had shoe prints in her face. 
[01:44:00]  The Rape of Agatha Dinsley.  What an awful sounding show.  It's a made-for-TV movie.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Any idea who's going to star as Agatha Dinsley?  I don't know.  How old are they?  She's supposed to be 79 years of age.  Betty White, maybe?  Yeah, that'd be great.  But she's too...  Agatha's a frail woman.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So you need someone a little thinner.  She has a degenerative bone disease.  She's very brittle.  She's a brittle-boned lady.  They cracked her hip in 15 places while they were pounding away on it. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  They throw her down the steps.  The whole...  Basically, the movie is two hours.  The Rape is an hour and 51 minutes.  No real character development.  Not at all.  All you see is Agatha handing out cookies and then the bell rings and three black fists  cave in the screen door and fucking shatter Agatha's teeth. 
[01:45:00]  Agatha?  That's how she says it after she's punched.  And then it's an hour and 51 minutes.  An hour and 51 minutes of brutality.  She gets thrown through a fucking drywall.  Kicked down the stairs.  Is it kind of like the Passion of the Christ?  Yeah.  It's a beating on that level of savagery.  On that scale.  Holy shit.  Oh, they shit in her tub.  Horrendous behavior. 
[01:45:30]  Gang graffiti all over the inside of the house.  They fucking...  They steal her cookie recipe.  That's all she had?  That's all she had was her cookie recipe.  And they stole that after?  Yeah.  Because the kids would love her cookie.  They didn't know what it was.  And they found it her secret ingredient, where she would take a regular chocolate chip cookie  and put one of her own asshole hairs into it.  And they're so disappointed.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:46:00]  Yes.  I can't take it.  Good old Agatha Tegley.  I can't even fucking breathe.  Well, I hope Oprah's sake...  It'll help the...  That'll help the ratings.  That'll help the own network.  Really sad.  She better not let those people go too far that she's employed all these years, because  she's going to need to get that show right back on the air.  Yeah.  All right.  What are the shows?  What does she got?  There are, like, a lot of weird, like, self-help shows.  Oprah presents Master Class. 
[01:46:30]  Uh-oh.  Show about white people.  Breaking Down the Bars.  Oh.  How to Get Away in Three Easy Steps.  Our America with Lisa Ling.  Ugh.  Searching for...  Your Father.  Ask Oprah's All Stars. 
[01:47:00]  A Scale.  Oh, no.  That's Dr. Oz, Susie Orman, and Dr. Phil.  Anna and Christina's Grocery Bag.  Oh, no.  They couldn't do Oprah's because something.  Because they only had a half hour for the show.  And they couldn't find something big enough to hold it.  I just found out thoughts.  Would have had to be Oprah's Grocery Giant Garbage Bin.  Boo.  Fuck, I should have quit while I was behind.  Zilch.  Sorry.  Christina Someone's Big Bowl of Love. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, great.  That's a bukkake show.  Deliver Me.  Baby show.  Dr. Phil.  Enough already with Peter Walsh.  Deliver Me.  It's probably where they give free abortions.  In the Bedroom with Dr. Laura Berman.  The Gayle King Show.  Miracle Detectives.  Mystery Diagnosis.  The Best of Trading Spaces.  Kidnapped by the kids.  Uncle Paul hosts that one.  What would you do?  The Own Edition.  I want to read some of the synopsis on these. 
[01:48:00]  Wow, that stinks.  What's Masterclass about?  Yeah, Masterclass.  Besides the obvious.  Oprah Presents.  Masterclass.  It doesn't even tell you what the show's about.  That's dumb.  Does it?  What is Masterclass?  Eight modern masters open up about success, failure, triumph, disappointment, and heartbreak.  Oof.  Yuck.  That's four O's and an F. Oof.  Yuck.  That seems horrendous.  Horrible. 
[01:48:30]  How do masters open up about that?  Well, it was great until I had to pick my own.  Exactly.  Wow, that's rough.  First time you get arrested for beating one, you don't know what to do.  That's rough.  That sounds horrible.  They are the what?  They are the stories you've never heard from the people you thought you knew best, handpicked  by Oprah for their unique impact on the world. 
[01:49:00]  Eight true modern masters sit down and share the untold stories that have shaped their lives.  Oh, let's eat you how they're stories.  Life lessons learned along the way.  In an intimate setting, failure, triumphs, disappointments, and heartbreak.  It sounds terrible.  It really sounds awful.  And who's going to be in the master class?  You got, well, first season masters include Diane Sawyer, Jay-Z, Maya Angelou.  Doesn't she do that bird poem? 
[01:49:30]  I hate her poetry.  That's a good poem, though.  The Caged Bird Sings?  Caged Bird Sings.  No, it's not.  Do you know why the Caged Bird Sings?  Oh, I...  Yeah, well...  Simon Cowell, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, Warren Michaels, and Oprah herself.  Oprah herself.  They're just boring people.  I know, exactly.  Yeah.  That dribble.  All right.  I don't like the website.  I'm looking at it right now.  It looks like an ad for fucking makeup or something.  It just doesn't look...  Nothing grabs you.  It's a bunch of broads. 
[01:50:00]  How about, you know, the cock and balls count for fucking ad dollars, too, you silly goose.  Why don't you stop selling it to holes?  All right, Vagisil.  We get it, you fucking pussies like a foot.  Scratch, scratch, scratch, all day long.  Scratch, scratch, scratch.  Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.  Ugh.  Look, it's all pink.  The page has, like, pink background stuff.  We get it, you're women.  Exactly.  No guys watching that. 
[01:50:30]  It's great when you take a fucking channel and just completely devote it to cutting off half the audience on Earth.  Really good.  Yeah, the ones that spend.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right, we'll move on to the things.  Things?  I guess that's it for the Oscars.  We didn't even tell you who won anything.  Who cares?  I figured if you cared, you'd know already.  Oh, who cares?  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was digging watching it, though, with the tweeting.  Yeah, the tweeting.  Without the tweeting, I don't know what, I wouldn't have watched it. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, no.  I would have went to bed at 9.30.  Mm-hmm.  No problem.  Yeah, no reason to fucking sit there and watch that shit.  And then make believe I saw the damn thing, like we do every year.  I think this is the first year we actually watched.  I shot four gallons of cum last night.  Does that have to do with anything?  But I still woke up after four hours.  Wow.  That is a good sleeping pill, though, when you knock one out.  Holy fuck.  When your mind's racing.  Oh, yeah.  Seems to calm you down, right?  Oh. 
[01:51:30]  Nice.  Releases something.  Sure does.  All over the bed.  Took the pre-cum piss, or the post-cum piss after that.  You know, that way you stand over the toilet for a minute, and your balls are confused.  Like your dick doesn't know what to do.  I always wanted someone to describe that feeling.  You just did it perfectly.  Your balls are confused.  Because what is it?  Everything's swollen, so it's giving you the illusion that you need a leak.  You don't really have to leak yet.  And what a pain.  It's almost like there's a little traffic cop in there holding the piss back. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  Until you come clear to the causeway.  I do believe there is some kind of little valve in there.  I know, but I was trying to move the valve.  Yeah, yeah.  You could piss through it.  That's kind of hard to do when you've got a raging one, and you're kind of leaning over the bowl.  That usually happens after a really good session, too, right?  Yeah.  A really good session will cause that.  I'll just wait until it goes away.  Yeah, but that's not easy when you're trying to sleep.  Well, that's true, yeah.  Yeah, it's right in there.  Yeah.  No.  What the fuck?  Let me see that valve, Dan.  It's a little check valve. 
[01:52:30]  I hate the side fucking medical drawings of cock and balls.  Yeah, the cross section.  It looks just like a snail crawling over a golf ball.  So horrendous.  Oh, my God.  That's exactly what that looks like.  If you turn it sideways, it looks like a warning at a golf course.  Be careful.  Snails are devouring golf balls. 
[01:53:00]  Why couldn't God just put the sack inside, by the way?  There's no reason for it.  Making us all look silly.  It's got to be a lower temperature.  No, I understand why scientifically.  Balls have to be 96 degrees to make sperm.  Oh, really?  And that's why they hang low, because it's kind of like, it's cooler.  They regulate their fucking temperature by sagging.  That's why when you get out of the ocean, they're sucked up into you like a...  And when you have a fever, they're fucking down to your fucking kneecaps.  I like a fucking nice, a nice hot batch. 
[01:53:30]  Like, you know, like where they've been fucking...  It's hot, but they've been crammed inside your body anyway, and your ball's like 106 degrees.  So you know the load's going to be fucking horrendous.  I love a good horrendous load.  Horrendous?  Yeah.  Now all I'm ever going to see is a snail crawling over a golf ball.  There's no reason for that fucking horrible diagram.  Too fucking funny, man.  And the vag is a good cross-section, too, because it looks like a steer. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, with the longhorn.  Yeah, longhorns logo.  Longhorns logo.  Fallopians.  Longhorn ram.  Sure does.  They're dumb ovaries.  There it is.  The longhorns.  Longhorn vag.  Exactly.  I hate the ovary pictures.  Look at that.  Two stalks.  They're stupid eggs.  I want to go down that dumb tube.  It's a stupid vagina. 
[01:54:30]  Into the stupid womb.  Everything says stupid.  It's dumb.  Reproductive parts are stupid.  Oh, that looks good.  I'd like to fuck her just like that, with a cut in half.  You're just sliding your dick in and out of a bloody trough.  Jesus.  Shouldn't it technically be called a herterectomy?  Yes.  Because they take out her plumbing.  Yeah, get it out here.  You're no longer a woman. 
[01:55:00]  Jesus.  The way they don't like hearing that.  It's funny.  You're a fucking, you're a Newark warehouse.  Of course.  Right on.  Hey, we got a man in Hazleton, PA.  Local news got him after a house was burned down.  Oh, yeah.  Local news wasn't going to fucking stop.  No, he's an eyewitness guy.  Could be the best eyewitness guy ever.  Really?  Could be.  Well, there's been a bunch of really good ones over the years.  But this guy, his name's Tommy. 
[01:55:30]  Tommy.  Oh, his house burned down.  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.  An explosion.  Freaking.  My father said, what the hell was that?  Freaking, I've seen smoke flying through the wall.  And I still looked at, the house is on fire. 
[01:56:00]  Freaking, I knew it.  I knew it.  Who does he sound like?  I knew it.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  And Chris Farley, though?  No?  Okay.  A little bit?  Definitely, there's some Chris Farley in there.  But, Tippi Tom.  Definitely the tipster.  We miss Tippi.  He did.  Yeah, we're coming up on two years already.  Really?  Yep.  That's kind of weird.  He's in a better shithole.  Yeah, he sure is. 
[01:56:30]  Tommy, you've had a few beers.  Is that because of the trying to forget the fire?  Uh.  I lived here my whole freaking life.  I lived here almost my whole life, buddy.  I lived through almost my whole life.  Man, you know, I have some bad things to say about those people that lived next door to us. 
[01:57:00]  Uh-oh.  Do you think you're lucky to be alive today?  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  He's got some bad things to say about the neighbors.  Yeah.  Now, I'm thinking...  Oh, yeah.  There's a problem.  Oh, yeah.  He brings it up, but he doesn't go the distance.  The racial problem.  He said he's going to go racial, but he never does.  He never went racial.  So, and I'm thinking, is he going...  Do you think he'll go black? 
[01:57:30]  Do you think he was going to go black or maybe...  Like...  It's only two.  Yeah, I know.  I don't even know where the Asians live.  I know where the Hispanics live, and I know where the blacks live, but do you really know  where the Asians live?  Seriously.  No, they're kind of everywhere.  They're kind of...  But they're not in one area unless it's...  They're in Chinatown.  No, besides the Chinatown, obviously.  I like how you just have an area.  It's like, it's Chinatown.  I know.  But besides that, where do they really live?  They all just squeeze into Chinatown?  They're really...  Amongst us all.  They don't really spread out. 
[01:58:00]  No.  They're like the Chinatown.  The Chinatown, yeah.  Do you think you're lucky to be alive today?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Because I'm frigging smart.  Frigging eyes.  I smelled the smoke.  My mother smelled it.  My father smelled it.  And it was a matter of time that that house... 
[01:58:30]  Frigging...  Went off.  This guy's a scream.  He's great.  I smelled it.  No.  You're lucky?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Tommy explains what he meant about his neighbors.  Uh-huh.  Here we go.  He has a problem with the neighbors.  Okay.  And I'll tell you why. 
[01:59:00]  I'm gonna get racial here.  I'm gonna get racial.  Okay.  Frigging...  Nobody filled that oil tank.  All...  All...  Winter long.  Nobody.  It was all...  Kerosene. 
[01:59:30]  I heard a...  Kerosene explosion.  I didn't know the sound.  Frigging...  I heard it.  Frigging...  Ask...  Boom, man.  I...  Frigging...  I heard the frigging explosion.  I've seen the...  Some...  Some...  Some...  Some...  Some...  Flying through my frigging damn wall.  Okay. 
[02:00:00]  Thank you.  Tommy, thank you for talking to me.  Tommy, thank you for talking to me.  Thank you.  And they're just like, oh my God, we got gold here.  Yeah, we got gold, all right.  We got gold.  I wish he would have gotten racial.  I know.  He didn't get racial, but...  He said he was gonna.  But he never did.  I know.  Chris of PA has a little knowledge on Hazleton.  Uh-huh.  Chris.  Even though he never got racial, he's probably referring to illegal immigrants, illegal Mexicans,  because they have a big problem with them up there, up there in Hazleton.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Ah.  So maybe the...  Maybe the kerosene.  And they didn't... 
[02:00:30]  They didn't fill up the oil.  Mm-hmm.  Then they used kerosene.  And he heard the kerosene.  Kerosene explosion.  Right.  Because he could tell the difference.  Yeah, he knows the difference between the two explosions.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Chris.  No problem.  Anyone else bummed that E-Rock's not here for the big Mayo story?  Fuck.  Do we have the Mayo story, at least?  Yeah, what happened there?  Big...  Where is E-Rock?  Is he still sick?  I don't know.  I think he made believe he was sick Friday, because he had a flight to catch, is what I'm thinking. 
[02:01:00]  He took it...  He had a day off today.  Did he have to go to the Mayo Clinic?  Like...  That's why you asked if he was sick.  I know.  You had that in your head already.  I was waiting to pop that out, but then he was on a plane, so...  You didn't care if there was an answer, did you?  No, not really.  That's how this works.  Yep.  Wait, he did well if he was sick Friday?  Yeah, well, he came in.  But he came in.  He made it look good, and then...  He pretended...  Well...  At the end of the first break, all of a sudden, he comes running in here. 
[02:01:30]  I've been puking all morning, even though there's no real proof of that.  He goes, I gotta go home immediately.  He has luggage with him.  The next thing you know, he's tweeting from an airport.  Yeah, he's going to his hometown of Florida, I think.  A little quick visit.  Home town.  Yeah, he's from Florida.  Pretty cool, huh?  Yeah, he's probably got a boat and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  But then he put on his Facebook status last night that he was still sick, so he wanted  everybody to feel sorry for him and stuff.  Hence, not being here today, I guess.  I guess.  Or did he have today off?  He did take today off.  He didn't have Friday off. 
[02:02:00]  He just, you know, he got sick in the bathroom, and I think it's an unhealthy lifestyle, but  that's me.  Oh, you think that's what's doing it?  Well, of course.  Nobody gets sick as much as he does.  Sam, can you read the Mayo story that we'll certainly bring up again tomorrow when he's back?  Yeah.  A section of Interstate 44 in southwestern Missouri was closed for several hours after  a tractor-trailer crashed and spilled its load, creating a giant slick of mayonnaise.  A giant slick of mayonnaise. 
[02:02:30]  Lieutenant Scott Levin told the Springfield news leaders that the truck driver lost control  taking the rig through a cable guard and into the median.  He said, walking on the spilled mayo was like walking on ice.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  And what was thought to be a wild hog was lapping it up until people realized, wait,  it's unshaven.  Hogs don't shave.  A dangerous nagel entered the scene.  No injuries were reported, and other vehicles were rerouted before the cleanup was completed. 
[02:03:00]  But yes, a mayo slick in Springfield, Missouri.  That's a lot of mayo, I bet.  Sure is.  I mean, it sure is.  Quite a mess for people commuting.  Yes.  Yes.  Very slick conditions.  Because of the mayonnaise.  The mayonnaise.  May-o-nays.  Which, E-Rock, by the way, loves.  Loves the mayo.  Loves mayonnaise.  Is he a Miracle Whip guy, too?  Will he eat that? 
[02:03:30]  I mean, will he?  Yes.  Yeah.  Would he prefer Hellman's original?  Yeah.  What the fuck is Miracle Whip, by the way?  Isn't it mayo with, like, more vinegar thrown in or something?  If you're going to do mayo, do mayo.  Why fuck around with that Miracle Whip?  Fuck it.  Miracle Whip.  Nothing better than mayonnaise on a sandwich.  E-Rock isn't a guy who likes to wait, though.  He's not a patient boy.  He's somebody who likes to be rewarded immediately.  Immediate gratification.  If he expects mayonnaise, and all we have is Miracle Whip, he will eat the Miracle Whip  while waiting for the mayonnaise to arrive. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, okay.  That's the circumstance.  Poor E of the Rock.  We'll bring that story back up tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Is he coming back tomorrow?  He should, unless he's super sick.  Yeah, maybe he's still sick.  Throwing up mayonnaise.  Maybe he'll be back to Wednesday.  Troy Kwan just handed in a Charlie Sheen.  I'm an F-18 bro.  He's obsessed with Charlie Sheen as Troy.  Is he really?  He's in love.  Well, Charlie Sheen could have had the greatest quote ever over the weekend. 
[02:04:30]  Don't want to fuck it up, so let me read this.  Verbaltum.  Transcripts.  Verbaltum.  Read it Verbaltum.  Verbaltum.  Charlie Sheen says he's on a drug.  It's called Charlie Sheen.  Yeah.  Could be the greatest quote ever.  Charlie Sheen.  How can you blame this guy?  Where could I pick up some Charlie Sheen?  How are you outraged by this guy?  Just enjoy it.  Couldn't be.  We haven't seen one of these in a long time.  Nope.  What was the last one we saw?  Where everyone was like, oh boy.  An unapologetic car wreck? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Britney was pretty good.  She was pretty good for a while.  She didn't care.  She was shaving her head and being nutty.  Swinging umbrellas.  Who was it?  Paparazzi.  Yeah, yeah.  She was being crazy.  Who were some of the great ones of all time?  You had Chris Farley was just amazing at the end of his life.  He would show up at events just completely out of control.  Charlie Sheen.  Britney Spears.  Lindsay Lohan sort of.  Yeah, yeah.  She's entered into that realm.  Who else?  Let me see.  They were still in the public eyes is what I'm talking about.  Falling apart completely?  Yeah.  Not these guys that fade away and then you hear things. 
[02:05:30]  That's a good one.  Steve-O.  Steve-O was a great one.  Yeah, Steve-O.  What about what's his name?  The old actor who broke into a bank and fell asleep in it?  Yeah, but...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but he does his on the side.  This has to be your whole lifestyle.  Like it's in front of the cameras is what I'm talking about.  Or on a radio show.  Yeah.  He didn't mean for it to get out, but Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson?  Oh, man, yeah.  Yeah, but that's...  Tiger.  What a great personal life coming apart that was. 
[02:06:00]  Do you realize how...  I know you guys don't follow God.  Oh, he sucks.  He's done.  He just sucks.  They don't want to say it yet, but he's dropping down in the rankings every week at this point.  He can't do anything out there.  I don't know what his current ranking is going to be, but he's not number one anymore.  He was number one for years and years and years.  And then they had this match tournament.  Travis knows.  He knows a little bit about golf.  He got knocked down the first round.  That image that he had, now that it's gone...  Right.  I think that image was part of what made him push.  It was to keep that image.  Because him being a great golfer was part of the image. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  So now that the other part of it is fucked up, I think he just doesn't take golf as seriously.  And as a golf fan, I cared at first.  I don't care as much because these young guys are pretty good to check out.  I mean, whatever.  I don't want to get too deep into it because it'll bore the shit out of everybody.  But when was the last time Tiger Woods won a tournament even?  I don't know.  It's been over a year because he had that whole thing go down last Thanksgiving and he certainly  hasn't won since then.  No.  And then there was a few months before that, so it's probably a year and a half since he's 
[02:07:00]  won.  Travis will look it up.  Wow.  But in the paper today, they said that Tiger Woods, listen to this, he goes to Dubai to  design a golf course.  So they go, oh, that's cool.  Yeah, we want a golf course designed by Tiger.  They gave him $55 million.  Oh.  Not only is the golf course not built, they abandoned the project.  Did he get his money?  I believe he walks away with $55 million for basically doing nothing.  Why did they walk away? 
[02:07:30]  They're having problems over there.  Where is this?  With Trump?  We got a friend that is living in Dubai and they got problems.  They overextended.  They can't finish these projects.  They're sort of running out of money because a lot of them are just sitting there.  What a bunch of dummies giving him the money and he took off.  He didn't take off.  He did his job.  He was waiting.  I'm sure they handed in the design and everything because Tiger Woods sort of designs  the course, but he gets guys behind him that really know how to do that shit.  And then they just abandoned the project and he walks with $55 fucking million. 
[02:08:00]  Tiger's last win, August 2009.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's not good.  A long time ago.  Oh, anyway.  So Troy, who's obsessed with Charlie Sheen, put a song together.  He's in love.  All right.  If it sucks, we'll stop it.  We're going to listen to this cold right now.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just  look at their loser lives.  And then they look at me and they say, I can't process it. 
[02:08:30]  Well, no.  And you never will.  Stop trying.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Enjoy the show.  Newsflash.  I am special and I will never be one of you.  This is me not on drugs, bro.  I will destroy you in the air and I will deploy my ordinance to the ground.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning.  You know, the first one's free. 
[02:09:00]  The next one goes in your mouth.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  Wait, can't process it.  Losers winning.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Buh-bye.  Buh-bye.  What do we think?  You guys have to talk about this story.  A fake cancer doctor raped and molested his gravely ill cancer patients. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, look.  We can't always knock it out of the park.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Everything is not going to be like gold.  We do that on a daily basis.  We deal with that here. 
[02:10:00]  Whether it's something as simple as a line that one of us throw out.  Look, I have a bunch.  To a bit.  Look, I have a bunch of stinkeroos every day.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd played a part in the...  I don't know what he actually did there.  He got a bed and then slowed down Charlie's audio a little bit.  Troy makes mixtapes.  He likes electronic music, so he's...  But that wasn't very electronic.  What I'm hearing, I heard like some goofy, clowny music.  Circus music?  Kind of. 
[02:10:30]  And then...  It's a juxtaposition.  Charlie Sheen's voice kind of fitting to the beat of it.  Right.  But there wasn't any like...  It was good.  Like auto-tuning or anything, which would have made it on the...  No, I liked it.  What do you got?  I thought it was good.  You did?  You went to another story right away.  Right when Sam said, so what do we think?  You were like, we got to get to this story.  It was like a random story on feedback.  You guys said it was always bad.  I thought it was fucking great.  I liked it, Troy.  I thought it was good.  You know how we go from it.  Sam is getting a little wacky with it.  I like those. 
[02:11:00]  No, I just haven't said well with the audio.  There you go.  Thanks for playing it.  I mean, everything can't be a banger, you know?  Yeah.  Troy played a part in the PSA that was on earlier.  That was good.  Oh, wow.  With bombs, too.  I'm just getting mad at Troy's hair.  How old are you?  33.  I'm fucking sorry, Ed.  No, that's fine.  I'm obsessed with Troy's hair, and I didn't hear you, and I have to apologize to you in  the audience, because it sounds like I missed a great one.  Fuck.  It was just underhanded. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, it really was.  Mean.  I was trying to say it quickly.  Yeah, yeah.  I love Troy's hair.  You can always see him walking down the hallway.  You know it's Troy from the back.  Cool.  But thank you for playing that.  I mean, you play the song again?  I don't know.  No, don't play it again.  Wait, you want to hear it again?  No.  It was good.  I liked it.  What?  Fuck you, Sam.  What?  We can play it one more time.  Fuck you, Sam.  I thought we were going to get another play out of it. 
[02:12:00]  We have a way of taking all the positivity out of an individual.  Oh, I know.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  Troy was so positive.  Yeah, he's all right.  That's it.  I do want to thank...  He can't hear right this second, right?  He's got to come back.  No.  Oh, oh.  No, he can't.  You didn't like it?  Go ahead.  No, no.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Never mind.  No, Travis waved me back in.  I didn't hear what you said.  Your hair is enraging.  I know.  It's a fucking mess.  I'm starting to do a comb-over thing.  It's not a comb-over. 
[02:12:30]  I'm trying everything to hold on to what I've got.  And you've got a fucking way too much hair.  Yeah, it is.  I've got to cut it off.  It is too much.  I hope you get one of those weird balding patterns.  Why would you hope that?  Can you Google image weird balding patterns?  I'm going to pick out what I hope happens to you.  Oh, God.  By the time you're 40.  The time I got in Chernobyl.  Just giant clumps falling out.  Give me a weird one.  I mean, some of the male pattern baldness is fine.  Give me a weird one. 
[02:13:00]  Where the...  Where it looks like a canal up the middle or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I want something horrific to happen to him.  Oh, something like this?  Let me see.  Oh, God.  The guy can't even grow his hair long enough to do a full comb-over.  The comb-over starts at his ear.  And he's combing it over.  And it just, three quarters of the way over,  it just wisps out on him.  Yeah.  And then you could hope his vision goes, too,  so he has to get those bad glasses.  I bet that guy, when he's brushing his hair over, 
[02:13:30]  he constantly has his head turned so it looks good in the mirror in that part.  Give me another one.  He just ignores all the flesh.  Yeah, yeah, all the fucking smooth skin.  See, there's not bad ones.  Donald Trump, we've seen it a million times.  Let's see.  What about something like this?  Let me see.  Intellectual property?  Some guy's awful balding is intellectual property?  Oh, God, that is bad.  What the fuck?  I don't know what's going on with his head. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  Whatever.  I do want to thank Troy for the Fab Faux tweet, though, over the weekend.  That's pretty cool, right?  Yeah, you know the Fab Faux?  We talk about these guys.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The Beatles song guys.  Their version of I Am The Walrus we played for everybody.  They do the Beatles perfectly.  Yeah.  They're obsessed with making it sound exactly like the record.  They don't fuck around at all.  And they came to SiriusXM and did Abbey Road?  They did the second side to Abbey Road, the suite.  That's their thing.  When you see them in concert, they do the entire album.  But that's pretty cool. 
[02:14:30]  They pick an album that they want to do, and they do the entire album.  Then I think they throw in a few others just to kind of bring it all together.  Can we play a piece of this thing?  It's on my Twitter.  Yeah, they use the same instruments that the Beatles used.  You've got to hear this, Ann.  I'm serious.  Just for a moment.  I don't know how many Beatles fans we got, but it's worth it.  A change of pace, obviously.  Is it better or worse than the Charlie Sheen song?  Let's listen to this.  Okay.  This is from SiriusXM.  Listen to how good this sounds.  It's a fast word a little bit, too. 
[02:15:00]  Why?  Because there's an intro here.  Oh, fuck.  Like here?  That's live from here?  Yeah.  And they nail the vocals.  And they take turns on the vocals.  It's not just one guy.  Depending on the song.  And if the song was doubled up on the album with vocals, they'll do two people through it. 
[02:15:30]  One sweet thing.  One sweet thing.  Pick off the bags and paint in the limousines.  Soon we'll be away from here.  Step on the glass and wipe that tear away.  One sweet thing.  Can't do.  Today.  Can't do.  Today 
[02:16:00]  Ain't true  Today  Yes, it is  Live, it's amazing  They're playing this fucking live  They have people playing strings there as well  Pop it forward a little bit  Just so the people can get a little taste 
[02:16:30]  His sister Pam works in the shop  She never stops  She's a golden eye  Takes her not to look at the queen  Only place that he's ever been  Always shouts out something obscene  Such a dirty old man  Dirty old man 
[02:17:00]  Fast forward again  Notice they're different singers  Depending on the song  Yeah  Go a little forward, Sam, please  Horns  Yeah, the tone of the guitar 
[02:17:30]  I never give you my pillow  Great live harmony  I only send you my invitation  And in the middle of the celebration  I break down  Boy, you're gonna carry that wave 
[02:18:00]  Carry that wave a long time  They do sound really good  God  Boy, you're gonna carry that wave a long time  There's nothing wrong with this  There's nothing wrong with this  No  There's not a flaw  No  Well, I'm probably just listening to the Beatles  One more fast forward  The love you take  Is equal to the love  This is probably why 
[02:18:30]  Brett Delft killed himself  He had a Beatles cover band  Probably heard these guys  And went, what the fuck am I trying  These guys are good, man  There's plenty of people out there  That can get together in a studio  And make it sound like the Beatles  Right  To fucking play live like that  Right  Is crazy  And have it sound that good  Didn't they say the Beatles  Had a tough time playing live  Later on in their short career 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah  Well, they didn't play live past 66  Yeah, I know  And one of the reasons was  They said it's too complicated  To bring out on the road  Yeah  They didn't have shit like monitors back then  So you'd get out on stage  And the bitches would be screaming  And they couldn't even fucking hear themselves  Sure  That was, I think, a 17-minute video  It just gave you a taste  Wow  I saw the Fabfo do the White Album  Start to finish  Including Revolution 9  Which was incredible  Really?  Yeah  It's a long, boring song  Yeah, it is  It's boring  But it was when John Lennon  Was experimenting with avant-garde music 
[02:19:30]  And he was in with Yoko  And they were trying different things  And trying take loose  And it's about 10 minutes of just noise  A lot of drugs  But, you know, in retrospect  It's kind of cool that they went that far out  Probably do the whole album, though  It's like, I understand, like  To play some songs that people don't hear  But  Wow  Well, it's kind of an experience  I mean, you know  You put on a record  And you listen to it all the way through  So to sit there and get that experience  From a live band is pretty incredible  And the Beatles knew how to make albums  Unlike today  They don't really make albums as much anymore  They just go for the hit  I remember smoking weed 
[02:20:00]  And then listening to Number 9  Of my friend's house  Yeah  And just like  It's a different experience  Did it talk to you?  When you're completely fucked up  It has to be  Yeah  It's like, whoa  And they fucked up with the panning  They did some, like, weird panning shit  Right  In the middle of the song  So it was like  Number 9  Number 9  And you're like  Ah, fuck  I'm freaking out  You nailed that  You can be in the Fab Faux  It's the Fab Faux  It's F-A-U-X  Fab Faux  Yeah  And they're touring all over the place  And they're just amazing 
[02:20:30]  And blah, blah, blah  Go to Troy Kwan's Twitter  To find the tweet  Because it's 17 minutes long  If you want to really get into it  It's Q-U-A-N  Troy Kwan  Q-U-A-N  Troy Kwan  On Twitter  Do they do the old Beatles albums?  Like Beatles for sale?  They do everything  Where it's like  Oh, they go all the way back?  Yeah  They do everything  Everything  I've even seen them do  A live show  Where it was Beatles songs  That were written  In the Beatles era  But then it came out  On their solo records  So some of the early  McCartney stuff  From his solo  And everybody else  You know 
[02:21:00]  How like YouTube  Has a lot of documentaries  That never see movie theaters?  Yeah  Someone  We were talking about this  Over the weekend  And someone tweeted me  That there's a documentary  Coming out  About Paul being truly dead  Really?  And if you can find it  There's a YouTube clip  Or a website  Or something  I think it's just  A website right now  But you can buy  The fucking movie  And I'm like  I think I gotta buy this thing  And I never buy into  These weird movies  Did you watch a trailer  Or something?  I don't even think  They have a trailer  But they explain 
[02:21:30]  That they have audio  I hope you into getting it  Yeah, they certainly did  They say they have audio  Of George Harrison  Basically on his deathbed  Admitting that Paul did die  And they had to cover it up  And  Well  And  I know  I know  Exactly  He didn't exactly have  Cancer of the heel  Or ankle  And then experts say  It's definitely George Harrison  But then they're trying  To figure out  If the audio  Was fucked with  And  They have all this proof  That he actually died  And  You know  We've heard this  Over the years  But there's new  Little clues  And songs  That have never been  Talked about 
[02:22:00]  Sounds like a conspiracy  To me  Do you have  You have  The website?  Is this it?  No  If you're gonna quote anybody  George Harrison  Motherfucking  Inside of his head  Sound like a fucking  Gelatin bowl  Put Paul is dead  In Google  Documentary  Something like that  It's not gonna be on YouTube  Cause they want you to buy  This fucking thing  I was hoping they had  A few clips  I'd love to interview  The guy that fucking  Started that rumor  Yeah  Remember that guy? 
[02:22:30]  Oh  I forgot about it  It was horrendous  Ah whatever  That's not it either  It's a brand new one  Maybe we'll have info  After the break  You could play  I Am The Walrus  By Fab Foe  Going into break  Off YouTube though  You don't want to play  Troy's song one more time?  We could do this  No let's not do that  You don't want to play it?  That's cool  I'm the walrus  Fab Foe  Fuck yeah  You like that?  Do you like the Beatles?  Do I like the Beatles?  What do you think?  Fuck yeah  The Beatles  That's the holy grail  Of rock and roll  They're the shit right?  They're the best  No one's gonna ever be  Better than the Beatles  His actual favorite song 
[02:23:00]  Is Ebony and Ivory  No that's not true  You like Ebony and Ivory?  That wasn't the Beatles  Well McCartney went through  A bad period  Between the 80s and the 90s  You don't like  Where they  Side by side  On my piano  Keyboard  Oh lord  Why can't we?  I don't know  Because on the piano  Fucking certain keys  Don't hit other keys  And take their purses  Idiot  Maybe that's why we can't  Certain keys  Don't have giant cocks  While other keys don't  I love when the news says  A key was seen 
[02:23:30]  Stealing something  Some unruly keys  They don't tell you  Which one it was  You know  What was it?  They just described  The outfit  It was wearing a hoodie  We got it  Yes  Goddamn minor keys  Stupid McCartney  I'm just waiting  For FabFo  I am the walrus  In a break  A little more  Where's Danny?  Danny's better at this  Are you looking up?  I didn't know  If you were looking  For them or for me  No I don't think  It's in the system  Okay  I am the walrus  FabFo  Are they popular?  Yeah they're fucking huge  And one of the dudes

[02:28:00]  The virus, Sirius XM  The O.P. and Anthony Show  This is The O.P. and Anthony Show  What is this, Jimmy? 
[02:28:30]  I don't know why I'm drawing a blank  I'm fucking here  Oh yeah, okay, Metallica  I like this  Oh, this is not  Oh, it's driving me nuts  It's not Cyanide  I love this album  Danny didn't love this  Did Travis just let you off the hook? 
[02:29:00]  No, Danny did  I was enjoying Jimmy trying to figure it out  Squirming  I knew it, I just  I happen to like this record a lot  I hate loops like this  She's playing a song  No  Oh yeah, I know  We should go back to doing a little of that  Yeah, we do a little here and there  There's no need to mix it up  There's some songs that just don't sound  Right  This sounds way better 
[02:29:30]  Like this  Yeah, this is a great band  You think?  Absolutely  I don't know if I agree with that  La, la  See how this is going to go  Michael Madsen here  Oh, good  We gotta get him in  Yeah  Don't make Michael Madsen wait  Where is he, Samuel?  I think he just arrived  He's walking down the hall  Yeah, he's walking out  Oh, is he?  First time in a couple years, huh?  Yeah  He's just a cool fucking dude, man  Yeah, he is  I'm very happy to meet him  You're gonna bark all day, little dog 
[02:30:00]  Look at him  He just looks like Michael Madsen  Wait till you hear him, man  He is the best  He is like the king  He is the shit  He is ridiculous  Look at Michael Madsen  Look at this guy  There you go  Hi  How you doing?  Michael  Michael Madsen, there he is  What's up, brother?  How you been, man?  Good?  Sounds like farts in here  That was either Jimmy or  It's the eggs  Or dumb egg whites  We just had some eggs  I hate that shit  Is that a gas mask for me?  It does stink, right? 
[02:30:30]  Egg whites suck  You're gonna have an egg  Have an egg  But the eggs smell  Egg whites  No matter what  Nah, you know what?  Egg whites smell worse than fucking  That yolk thing cancels it out or something  It was the Swiss cheese, too  Oh, was it?  I think so, yeah  That's gotta be really bad  You smell very good  All the way it comes out  Did you just pull a Red Bull out of your back pocket?  Yes, I did  Right the fuck off  A little energy  Quick energy  Hey, I need a kickstart  You need a little kickstart  It's early in the morning  You're not a morning guy, right? 
[02:31:00]  Well  No  Yeah, no  Well, I am  I mean, if I have to be  Yeah  Yeah, you know  I can be a morning guy  It depends on what I have to do in the morning  When you wake up next to her  It's not that hard to face  Well, I wouldn't imagine it would be  Yeah  I gotta get this sound here  Did you watch the Oscars last night?  I have to ask you  It's my turn  Yeah  I did watch them, yeah  Of course, didn't everybody? 
[02:31:30]  What's your take on that whole thing?  Well, I think I was really happy that the King's speech got something  A few things  I don't usually watch a lot of movies  Because sometimes if that's what you do for a living  It's hard to really appreciate it  Because you know exactly how it was done  And it's kind of hard to take yourself  It takes the magic out of it?  Yeah, but I did watch that picture  And I thought it was really damn good 
[02:32:00]  And I was happy that it got recognized  And didn't get buried under some  Piece of shit  Well, yeah  Exactly  That's what happens  It usually does happen  I was surprised  I thought it was pretty spread out across the board  Yeah, well, I guess they did pretty good  Because what do they get?  They got picture, actor, and director  Yeah, so that's kind of  Those are the big ones  It's good news for Bob and Harvey Weinstein 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah  I thought Colin Firth deserved best actor  The movie itself, I kind of liked Inception  It was just a true story  So I thought he was amazing  But the guy was just yammering through the whole fucking thing  We got it  Yammering  Inception isn't about Leo  It's about the special effects  Yeah, yeah  That's true  Didn't they win for that too?  Special effects?  I think they did  Sound editing, all that stuff  Yeah, I haven't seen the picture  So, you know  I have to be nice and fair  I haven't checked out Inception yet 
[02:33:00]  I start talking about people  People will never give me a job, so  I keep phasing out on that movie  I hated it for the first ten minutes  And then all of a sudden  I watched it again and I loved it  Just like, God damn  Yeah, you gotta watch it a couple times  Yeah, yeah  You just kind of watch it  Jesus, it's not so bad  I love that fucking  Because there are certain points of that movie  You could definitely get up  To go grab something from the fridge  Or take a piss  And not care if you come back  And sit down for the rest of it  Yeah  I was like, ah  That's a bad sign  I don't know  2010 John Cusack thing  Oh, man, yeah 
[02:33:30]  In the name of almighty God  You really need that  Why is it determined to make these pictures  About the end of everything  Apocalypse  This is what's going to happen tomorrow  Battle of Los Angeles  That's one that's coming out soon  The Winter Bone was very good, I thought  Yeah  Yeah  The Winter's Bone  And that had that fucking  You know  When you look at the guy  That was behind the counter  At the liquor store  In fucking Dust Till Dawn  And he's nominated for an Oscar 
[02:34:00]  It's like, wow  That's pretty fucking cool  That guy was good  He was intense  He really got that  Backwoods scary kind of thing  Yeah, yeah  That would have been a good part for me  Yeah, fuck yeah, man  Yeah, I could have smoked that for sure  Yeah, definitely  Do you watch movies like that  Where you're like  I know I could do that better than him  He's fucking awful  Well, it's not that I would do it better  But I'd do it different  And, you know  My wife talked me into watching the picture  I'm glad she did  It was really good  Yeah  Good girls  I don't know 
[02:34:30]  All the characters seem so real  They're a threat  They actually had a real threat  Behind what they were doing  And it was cool  There's something about  When you can really  Kind of relate to a character  On screen  As opposed to just  They think that the action  Or just blatant violence  For no reason  Is going to make it  A good movie  When you don't give a shit  About who is having violence  Perpetrated upon them  Yeah, I think you're right 
[02:35:00]  And there's  There has to be some depth  Behind the violence  Yeah, yeah  I mean  Not to care of something  About the person  Or understand the person  Perpetrating these things  Yeah, I mean  I'm sure you've heard it  A thousand times  The violence perpetrated  Against that poor cop  Sitting in that chair  Well  That was  But that was done perfectly  That was, you know  Done in a way  Where it's like  You obviously understood  Your character  You understood  This cop is really fucked 
[02:35:30]  Even though  They didn't get into  You know  His whole story  But you knew enough  About him  And you knew  He was scared shitless  So it was just done  Very well  You know how scary it is  When you're begging  For your life  And you hear  Are you done?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Are you done?  That really did  Fuck with people  Is the fact that  There's no talking  Himself out of this  Because you're really  Annoying me  This guy  He's talking to a fucking  He's talking to a pit bull  I was busy  Trying to get something  Finished 
[02:36:00]  And it wasn't  This thing  You're finished  Is that it?  Is that it?  I know  You know  I'm not even sure  That was in the script  I probably made that up  Really?  Just kind of  Yeah  Personally I probably  Wanted to go to lunch  Or something  Subconsciously  I was trying to get out  You've done  You know  What is it?  Three o'clock  I want to get back  To Malibu  Starving  What makes that scene  Horrified too  Is when he leaves  And it's just a beautiful  Day outside  And I think you hear  Dogs barking  Yeah, yeah  With birds chirping  Kids playing and stuff 
[02:36:30]  You're like  Holy shit  There's a horror show  Going on inside  That was my car  That was my car  Oh that's right  You ever sell that thing?  No, in fact  I still have it  We tried to sell it  For you last time  Yeah  I didn't get  A good enough offer  No  Man  It got up to  Some ridiculous  Like 15 grand  Or something  You gotta be kidding  I wouldn't give  That damn thing  Up for 15  Jeez  I'll leave it  For my kids  After I croak  Then when I croak  The car will 
[02:37:00]  Like triple in value  Yeah, what?  This was his car  You might remember  This car  Remember this car  Michael Madsen  Opened the trunk  To get a gas can  To burn a guy  Yeah  That's the best part  It's such a nice day  But he's going to get gas  To burn a man  I forgot  I left it in the car  I'll be right back  Yeah  We actually left Kirk  In that chair  At lunchtime once  Really?  It was just a joke  You know  He didn't appreciate it 
[02:37:30]  What are you working on now?  I don't even know  What he's promoting  You've got like  A thousand projects  You're working on  There's a Michael Madsen  Book right in front of him  The IMDB is full of shit  Okay, so  There's a lot of things  In there that are  Very irresponsible  And you have to be careful  With those guys  Oh really?  Yeah, you run into somebody  On an elevator  And they tell you  Their brother-in-law  Wrote a script  And the next thing you know  It's on the IMDB  That's in post-production  Oh shit  And it's really not right  I'll keep that in mind  I take it as law 
[02:38:00]  Just call me  And I'll tell you  I'm here promoting  A picture called  The Bleeding  I did a vampire picture  With DMX  And Michael Mathias  Is the lead of the picture  And Vinnie Jones  Is in it  And it's pretty good  It's a big action movie  I play a priest  Actually in the film  Not a  Like a priest  Well, he's a priest  But he's  He's a priest  With a Thompson  So badass  Machine guns  He's got two 
[02:38:30]  They're like 25 pounds  A piece  Two Thompson  Trying to shoot them  Both at the same time  It's pretty cool  God damn  Yeah  I bet  It sounds like fun  Oh, it's  Yeah  It's a good movie  There's an audience  For that type of picture  And  It's  You know  Having a big premiere here  Like a red carpet event  Oh, cool, man  You want to come?  Yeah, we'll go  I'd love to  You're all invited  Yeah  When is the premiere?  It's  What does that say  Right there?  It's  February 25th 
[02:39:00]  To March 3rd  Village Cinema East  February 25th  By the way  February 25th  Could we be less  Show busy people?  We should have said  When can you come?  We should have said  Well, when is it?  We'll check  But no one said  Yes, we're available  Of course we are  It doesn't matter  When or anything  Live broadcast  From the red carpet  We're there  So the red carpet's  Happening for a few  Different days  I'm confused  I think it's there too  That's the exclusive  Engagement  I'm imagining  The red carpet  Is probably the 25th  The first night  Well, the 25th happened 
[02:39:30]  Oh  No, it's tomorrow night  Yeah, we're up to the 28th  Oh, okay  It's tomorrow night  Or tomorrow night  Roland, what's going on?  Do you know what's going on?  With what?  With the red carpet  In this movie?  Wait a minute  I just got some notes  It says  Oh, it's  Roland just kind of  Handed over  The cast sheet  Of the bleeding  That's good  Because we were wondering  Who the executive producer was  Roland  Why are you handing us this?  We're just trying to be polite  Roland just handed a list

Did you get to check out  Some of those weird sex shows?  They get really strange over there  Yeah  In the strip clubs and stuff  With darts  They have different themes 
[02:41:30]  You know  They have different girls  Secretaries  And pom-pom girls  And college  I saw some girl  She took a pin  With a feather on it  And put it in a straw  And then put it in her vagina  And did some kind of muscle move  And the pin shot out  And popped a balloon  Not bad, huh?  It's fucking amazing  That's a hell of a talent  Can you do that, honey?  She doesn't have to  She has many other things  Many other talents  Keep me occupied  I need some glasses

Somewhere  Somewhere 
[02:42:30]  Somewhere  Somewhere  It's called Red Dragons  The dragonflies  Have an air strip  Have an air strip in Thailand  They line up like little red helicopters  All along the stretch of stone  Next to the pool  Every morning I go for a swim  And even sometimes in the river  One has to be careful  Because the river Kwai  Has a strong current  I heard that long ago  There was a bridge  That became famous  Because it was blown up  By POWs during the war  To stop supply trains  From getting across  I also heard there are some letters 
[02:43:00]  Written by soldiers  That were here  And now I'm walking by  The same waterway  Eating strange fruit  And Russian salami  Caught with a switchblade  I bought at the marketplace  You know you've been in a place  Long enough  When your farts start to smell  Exactly like the jungle around you  There are a lot of  Different kinds of jungles  And a lot of  Different kinds of farts  This morning  I came down the stairs 
[02:43:30]  And a small Thai woman  Smiled at me  And she wore a blue uniform  Which meant she worked  For housekeeping  And I recognized her  As the one who always  Put fruit in my room  Her smile was like the smile  Of the generations of Thai people  And I hope the smell of my farts  In my room  Has not offended her  But she would have  Smiled at me anyway  Because that's the way  That they are  She was eating grapes  And I asked her  If she was taking a break  And she smiled again  I went to the lobby 
[02:44:00]  To my car  And out to the set  Where I spent  The rest of the day  Playing a crazed  American mercenary  Massacring Asian families  And burning their village  To the ground  The last time  I came back from here  I spent a few days  In a nuthouse  I hope that doesn't  Happen again  Holy shit  That's great  What a great little  Chunk of your life there  For a moment  Listen to those pages of it  If  That's a great book  I need some help 
[02:44:30]  Fellas  You need two  I'll leave this for you  That's great man  You should be doing  Book signings with that  You should literally  Be doing book signings  That's great  Great pictures in here  What kind of stuff  It's a color book  What kind of pictures  Is in there Jimmy  We only have one copy  Of the book  That's the south of France  Wow  That's my little  Five year old Luke  Cool hand Luke  He calls himself  Cool hand Luke  Self proclaimed  Cool hand Luke  No he has a  Cool hand Luke  Poster on his wall  And he recognized  His name Luke  And he said  It's cool hand Luke 
[02:45:00]  So now  What's your name  He goes  Cool hand Luke  He can't  He's going to  Try to eat 50 eggs  I hope he doesn't  That's a tough order  Great shots in there  No he's a cool  Little guy  He's actually  Yeah he's charming  He's pretty funny  At five  He dislocated my jaw  The other day  How'd that happen  I was in a hotel  And he was there  With me and his mom  And I had one 
[02:45:30]  Of those bungee cords  That you exercise with  Right  It has these big  Wooden handles on  Anyway he  He stretched it  I was sitting on the  Couch like that  And he stretched it  All the way  To the door  Of the room  You know  And I realized  I was like  Oh shit  You know  And he was just  Staring at me  And I thought  It was like  One of those moments  Where I could have  A father and son  Lesson  In trust  And love  You know  And I said  You know son  If I was to let go 
[02:46:00]  On my end  Of this thing  It most likely  Would take your head  Off  I said  At least knock you  Against the wall  And you know  Might hurt a little bit  And he was staring  At me  And I said  But you know what  I'm not going to let go  Because I love you  And I want you  To trust me  I'm your father  And about  Three or four seconds  Was by  You know what he did  He fucking let go  Man  And boy  I'm telling you  That thing 
[02:46:30]  I don't know  If you've ever been  Hit by a bungee  That's been stretched  Six, nine or ten feet  From you  But it got me  Right in the side  Of the face  And I felt like  I just got smacked  By Marvin Hagler  And I  It literally  Knocked me over  I was like  Sitting on a hide of bed  And it dislocated my jaw  Right  So  Yeah  You know  And he thought  It was funny  I rolled over  On the floor  And I hit my face  And I popped it back in  But then  My face swolled up 
[02:47:00]  Like a pumpkin  On one side  But  It was one of those moments  You know  Did you have any  Post  Taken out by a five year old  Trust speech with him  After that  Yeah  He was really sorry  And I knew that  He was sorry  And I just  Hugged him  And told him  He was a good boy  What are you going to do  You know  You're  No  No  Corporal punishment  With the children  No  No  I got enough of that  When I was a kid  Yeah  I don't  I try to 
[02:47:30]  Sometimes that perpetuates  The thing  I want them to  Love me because  I want them to  Listen to me  Because they love me  Not because they're scared of me  Yeah  It's a different deal  You know  What was the most common form  Of discipline  You  When you were growing up  Don't punch in the face  The most common form  Yeah  Lights out Mike  Yeah  Oh Jesus  And wake up later  And wonder  What the  Oh man 
[02:48:00]  What did I do  To deserve that  Down the stairs  Well you seem like  You were probably  A pretty rambunctious kid  And maybe a handful  As a teen  Well  Later in life  I realized  Perhaps I had it coming  A few times  But you know  I don't know  Those days are over  You ever get in serious trouble  Arrested  Shit like that  When you were growing up  I think that's probably  What was irritating my father  Oh yeah  It's the punches  I was constantly in trouble  For some damn thing  One thing or another  But I was innocent back then 
[02:48:30]  Yeah  Stealing cars  And that kind of thing  That's innocent  Yeah it's a felony  Yeah well  Yes I know  Unfortunately I can't vote now  Because of that  But a lot of my friends  All my pals I grew up with  They're not here anymore  And so I guess I'm lucky  I made it  And they didn't  And even recently  I mean I lost  Chris Penn  Oh yeah  David Carradine  Dennis Hopper  You know all these guys 
[02:49:00]  Were really like  You know  You're not going to see  The likes of people  Like that again  I mean really  No  You don't miss somebody  Like that until  They're not around anymore  And then you go  Oh my god almighty  Who am I going to talk to  At 3 o'clock in the morning  Now you know  Did you  You knew Carradine  Did anybody  I mean  Hopper was old  And he was sick  But Carradine  Kind of went  And really  People would never  Would have seen  That one coming  Did you  Did you know that  About him  Knowing him  Was that like  Something he'd be  Open with his friends  I think if you  Are going to go out 
[02:49:30]  In some sort of  Sexual mystery  In your 70s  I don't even know  If we're supposed to laugh  I don't know  It doesn't get better  Than that  It makes perfect sense  Yeah  It was a sexual mystery  Yeah I mean  Well no one's ever  Really going to know  What happened  You know  It's like Kennedy  Or Marilyn Monroe  You know  What really happened  But no one's going to know  And I think that's  Kind of interesting  I mean it's very David  To have done something  Like that  Really  You know  I mean  What an exit  Yeah it's sort of like  A 
[02:50:00]  That's a great way to put it  What an exit  I'm leaving now  And this is what happened  It's sort of like  What's his name  Bob Crane  Is the same thing  Like no one really knows  What happened to him  Well no one cares  No one cares  But it was such  A sordid thing  Like you just thought  Of him as being  Dumb Hogan  From Hogan's Heroes  Got murdered by a tripod  And then you find out  Like his skull  Was literally pulverized  With a tripod  Somebody was angry  Yeah so I was mad  He didn't do it to himself  That's for sure  No it wasn't suicide 
[02:50:30]  I hit myself  Because he used to film  And videotape  Like his sexual exploits  All the time  Probably fucked somebody's wife  And videotaped it  That would be an interesting  They should put that  On an adult channel  Somewhere  Yeah  The Crane tapes  How come that  Has never came out  I don't know  You would think  There'd be a shitload  Of films and videos  Of Bob Crane  Just going at it  He had a big hog  Why don't we go past  The fact that he  Popped his own jaw in  We just 
[02:51:00]  That's like a normal thing  That did strike me  As really uncomfortable  But I just  If it happened  To any one of us  We'd be calling 911  We'd be at the hospital  Michael Madsen  He just casually  Popped my jaw back in  And we're like  Yeah of course  That's what we would do  If that happened to us  She was trying to call  The hospital  An ambulance or something  And I said  Honey no  In the name of God  Don't do that  I don't need to be  You know  Filmed by someone  Madsen arrives  In the hospital  I mean  Just honey  Broken jaw  Oh boy  I can take care of this honey 
[02:51:30]  Please  Don't panic  Danny points out  You're talking to a man  With motorcycles  All over his shirt  And skulls on his boots  So I'm surprised  He popped his own jaw in  All right  Exactly  Good point  I need to go shopping  My wardrobe  Is getting a bit tired  Honestly  I don't  My bags are all messed up  And I didn't  I didn't have some nice clothes  I  I should have went to the Oscars  I might have got a free suit  Out of it  Do you ride? 
[02:52:00]  Sorry?  Do you ride bikes?  Oh god  Yeah  Yeah  I got a couple  I have the bike from Hellride  See that picture?  Oh yeah  Yeah  I know the one  Dennis and David  I got the Gent bike  They built that bike for me  For the movie  And then at the end of the thing  When they first gave me the bike  It didn't  There it is  Right there  Look at that thing  Wow  That's an S&S bike  It's a shovel head motor  On an S&S frame  You know that bike  Has no front brake 
[02:52:30]  You could tell  There's like  Nothing really there  When I went to the set  On the first day  I said  Where's my bike?  And they said  Oh it's in the truck  And they took it out  And I looked at it  And I said  You guys  There's no front brake  And I said  Oh Jesus  You're right  And I said  Well  How am I supposed to stop on a hill  Up or downhill  And hit a mark in a movie  With no front brake  I said  You know  I'm going to kill myself  And because of that last statement  The part about killing  I get a letter from  The Weinstein company  Telling me that 
[02:53:00]  If I ride that bike in the movie  They're not responsible  For what happens to me  And you know  So  We  I taught myself  How to ride it  Without the front brake  And then  Then they made a double of it  But it didn't look  Exactly the same  The back fender was different  And the front wheel  Looked different  Because now it had  A great big disc on it  And so I  I said  Listen  I already know  How to ride this one  So I'm going to keep this one  And I'll sign the paper  I'll sign the death warrant  But I want to keep the bike  Oh shit 
[02:53:30]  So it was kind of a deal  We made  Your life  In my garage  Risking your life  For the bike  Yeah  Pretty much what you did  No  It's in the garage  I got the jet bike  None of all those items  It'll be worth some dough  When I kick them  Jesus  How much harder  Is it to stop  I don't know how to ride a motorcycle  How much harder is it to stop  With no front brake  Well it depends on how fast you're going  Depends on what kind of surface you're on  And you know  You can usually glide into something  With a foot brake  And then eventually 
[02:54:00]  Put your foot down  And just  You don't want to try to stop  On a hill  Man  No  It's a bit sketchy  But we were in Barstow  And there's a lot of flat  Highways over there  Gets a little squirrely  It's a good brake  It's a great motorcycle picture  You know the plot doesn't make much sense  But it's really fun to watch it  You can understand what it's about  But it's really cool to watch it  Quentin Tarantino cut that thing  Thank God he saved it by editing it  Yeah  Really  Well apparently it was pretty hard 
[02:54:30]  To put it together  And they had a  Did a couple passes on the editing  And then finally Quentin said  Okay  Now it's my turn  And he took all the footage  And actually put it together  Really nicely  Those are the most underrated guys  In Hollywood are the editors  Sally Minky too  Yeah  She was on the  When they did the memoriam thing last night  They showed Sally  Yeah  Yeah  She's cut me  Good lord  A lot of times  Yeah  She was really wonderful  It's sad what happened to her  It is amazing  What happened to her 
[02:55:00]  She died hiking  Yeah  Oh she was the one  That died hiking  She was up in Griffith Park somewhere  That's right  With her dog sitting next to her  Hypothermia  Yeah  Good God  I used to hike in Griffith Park  When I first went to Hollywood  Why?  Was it the thing to do?  Get out and do some hiking?  I used to hike up to the observatory  Oh nice  And I used to sit up on the roof up there  And read scripts  And look at the Hollywood sign  If you could see it 
[02:55:30]  Through the smug  And I don't know  I was very introspective in those days  Thought it was like the thing to do  And  You know  I was a loner  I was here by myself  I was pumping gas  And Union 76  And I had my little  I had my Harley  And that was about it  And you know  I didn't know where I was  How do you separate yourself  From everybody else  That has a script  And is trying to  Get work out there  And working at gas stations  It took a while  Yeah  It took a long while  I met a lot of people 
[02:56:00]  Pumping gas  Fred Astaire  Came in on Christmas Eve  I remember  He had a flat tire  And I met Peter Falk  Cicely Tyson  Warren Beatty  Jack Lemmon  Gas station to the stars  Jack Lemmon  Had this really old MG  And I met Tom Knott's  One time  Really?  Yeah  Were any of them cocks  Or no they were all okay?  Huh?  Were any of them pricks  Or they were all okay?  I thought Warren Beatty  Was very bizarre  And then years later  He was supposed to play 
[02:56:30]  My brother in Kill Bill  Warren Beatty was  The original Bill  In Kill Bill  Oh really?  But him and Quentin  Just couldn't  Understand each other  So they decided to  Not work together  That's how David Carradine  Got in there  But everybody was pretty nice  I met Donald Sutherland  Came in one time  He was very bizarre  He's about 7 feet tall  But I had my  The guy that I worked for  His name was Ray  And I started getting 
[02:57:00]  Episodic television shows  I got an episode  Of St. Elsewhere  And then I did  An episode of  Cagney and Lacey  And I went to  You know I said  Look you know  I got a TV show  And I have to be off  For you know  Tuesday and Wednesday  And he goes  Listen kid  Let me tell you something  I was like  What?  What is it?  And he goes  You better figure out  What you want to do  You know  Why didn't you tell us  You were an actor  When we hired you  And I said 
[02:57:30]  Well I really didn't think  I was qualified  To say that  And he said  We need you around here  So you better  Make up your mind  Son  What are you going to do  The chances of this  Continuing to happen  Are a billion to one  And I said  Well  Considering I'm making  Two dollars and fifty cents  An hour  With you man  And I said  You know  I think  Maybe I'll take a shot  Take it  After a few more shows  I just  That was it  I worked with Dice  For a long 
[02:58:00]  I toured with him  And he loves you  He would speak  Very very frequently  About your days  On Crime Story together  Yeah he's a fun guy  He's great  I probably would have  Seen on this weekend  If I'd been in L.A.  Because I was supposed  To do that  Thing at the Beverly Hills Hotel  The Night of One Thousand Forgotten  But  I didn't make it  What's that?  I'm just joking  It's a thing called  How stupid am I?  No it's a thing called  Night of a Hundred Stars  And they do it  At the Beverly Hills Hotel  It's like a viewing party  And it's very nice 
[02:58:30]  And you see a lot of people  Like Mickey Rooney  And Connie Stevens  Holy shit  Oh wow  Liz Rigno  And Batman  There'd be me and David Carity  To sit there  You know  Why are we here?  Then Dice would come over  And sit down  And it would all become obvious  And understandable  Now there goes Judd Nelson  Holy Jesus  What would  Would it be open to the public? 
[02:59:00]  Is that Scott Bale?  It's like Comic Con  My God almighty  You get real excited  Is it open to the public?  Do people come in?  So what is it?  Norby Walters  Throws the whole thing  It's actually a really  Really nice event  I met  Tana Nicole there  Remember her?  Oh yeah  Yeah  She reached across the table  And grabbed my hand  And she was  Telling me how much  She loved me  And Thelma and Louise  And she wouldn't let go  Of my hand  She's a big chick 
[02:59:30]  Man you know  And she was pulling hard  And she almost pulled me  Across the table  For Christ's sake  I mean I had to pull away  From her  I had to get away from her  She was like  A rhino  She was a big girl  She was hammered  What do you do  In between films?  What do you do for fun?  Well I have six boys  Yeah remember that  Lots of kids to take care of  And there's a lot in here  About them  It's  Being a father 
[03:00:00]  Of that many boys  Is very very complicated  Because they're all  In different stages  Of their mental development  You know  So one of them's  You know  In this phase  And the other one's  In that phase  And they're all kind of  In a wonderful way  What are the ages?  My oldest son is 23  Then I have 21  17  16  13  And 5  You're just  You are really  Very virile man  You are in it 
[03:00:30]  Testosterone  Yeah  I'm busy  With them  Did you keep going  Because you wanted a daughter?  No  I  The daughter thing  Is very scary to me  I  Who knows  I mean maybe someday  But right now  It doesn't seem likely  I wouldn't want to  Raise a girl anyway  It would be too complicated  I'd prefer  If I had a daughter  I'd want her to be gay  Yeah that's what  A lot of guys say  The thought of some  Sleaze  Yeah  Hello Mr. Mattson 
[03:01:00]  Hey wait a second  Man  I know what you're doing  Yeah I remember that  It's different when the boys  When the sons  Have the girlfriends come over  And they have the towel on  You know  Hi Mr. Mattson  You're like  Oh my god  You know please  Go in the other room  Go outside  Please  Go away from me now  You have to leave  Yes please  Get out  Oh shit  Out of town  And the housekeeper 
[03:01:30]  Is like  You know  There's a young lady  Over here  And the boys  Have her in the room  And I'm like  Well  Okay  Mommy and daddy  Are not home  They take over  Trust me  Do you see any of them  Maybe  Going in the direction  You went in  As far as  Maybe a little trouble  Here and there  Well I think  They could skip  The trouble part  Yeah  Because that didn't  Do me any good  But  My oldest boy 
[03:02:00]  Wants to be  A tattooist  And  He's actually  Pretty good at it  And  My son  My 21 year old son  He wants to be an actor  Which  I've tried to talk him on  Of aggressively  But he's really  Kind of stuck out  He auditioned for the  Actor's studio  And he's been studying a lot  And  He's got an agent  A manager  And  He's a very handsome kid  He looks like Clint Eastwood  I mean he's really  You know  Whatever it is  You know 
[03:02:30]  It  Or whatever it is  I mean he has it  But  It's very  Very  Very  It's a lot harder  To get involved  Than I think he understands  It's really  Very  Very  Isn't that something  He'll learn though  I mean  It always seems like  Actors try to  Discourage their kids  From going into acting  What is it that  That is so  Bad about that  I think  You have to have  A really thick hide  And  You know  The rejection end  Of everything  And the competitive  Part of it all  You know 
[03:03:00]  If you're not  Really  Don't know  What that end of it is  It can really destroy you  It can rip you up  And  I just don't want him  To have to go through that  If you look at  Anthony Quinn  Or  Kirk Douglas  Or  Anybody who had  A few sons  Marlon Brando  For God's sakes  Steve McQueen  I mean  Their sons  Really were up against  A great big problem  Because every time  They walk in a room  People would look at them  And go  What happened 
[03:03:30]  You know  What I mean  It's kind of  Left them  A little bit  Without anything  To do in life  Did Brando's kid  Try to act  Oh yeah  I didn't know that  Christian did  I was pretty good  Friends with him  For like  About two years  Before the shooting  And  We had  We had an awful  Lot of fun together  Christian was pretty cool  But he didn't know  What to do with himself  And I felt sad  For that  Did you know Marlon  I met him  Twice  He was 
[03:04:00]  I was with Christian once  And  It was on New Year's Eve  And it was about  Three o'clock in the morning  And  And the phone rang  And  Christian was like  There's still  The time pointing at the phone  You know  He didn't like to  Answer the phone  So I picked it up  And I was like  Oh put Christian on the phone  And I'm like  What  I want to speak to my son  And I was like  Oh my god  So I put my hand  On the phone  And I said  Christian  You know  It's your dad  Man  And he's like  I don't want to  Talk to him  I'm not going to 
[03:04:30]  Say nothing to him  Tell him I'm not here  And I was like  Okay  So I went  Yeah  He's kind of  I'm not sure where he is  He's not  He's not here  And he goes  Put my son on the phone  And he had to  And I was like  Whoa  Shit man  Now he's  Yelling at me now  You know  I'm like  Great  I just talked to Marlon  Brandon  He's yelling at me  Okay  You're lying to him  Thanks man  Yeah I'm lying to the guy  Right  Tell him I lied  It's three o'clock in the morning  Everybody's loaded 
[03:05:00]  You know  He's loaded  You know  And I'm like  This isn't good  Right  So I say  Christian  In the name of God  Pick up the phone  And he's like  Yeah  So he goes in the other room  And he picks up the extension  You know  And I'm trying to be polite  I'm not going to hang up  I want to make sure he gets it  Right  So I'm listening  You know  And Christian picks up the phone  He's like  Yeah  And Marlon goes  Who was that asshole  That picked up the phone  And I was like  Great  You know  I said  No  And now he's called me an asshole 
[03:05:30]  You know  I was like  You sure lost points real quick  Fucking hell  You know  It wasn't a good beginning  What a great story  Hey who'd you come up with  In the business  I had a bite of the evening  And I was like  I'm the asshole  Oh you actually  Was that you  Was that you  I go yeah  Who'd you come up with  In the business  Who were your peers  Who'd you start out with  Out there  Well I grew up  Watching Kirk Douglas  And  And 
[03:06:00]  Burt Lancaster  And  Lee Marvin  And  Robert Mitchum  All the tough guys  You know  Those guys  Were pretty  Interesting  They don't have actors  Like that anymore  Humphrey Bogart  And Spencer Tracy  And  Jesus  You know  That kind of talent  Just doesn't exist anymore  But I  I  Started off  Doing episodic television  You know  I was orderly  In the hospital 
[03:06:30]  And I  Worked as an auto mechanic  I worked as an orderly  I  I did landscaping  I was a pipe fitter  A plumber's apprentice  I went to school  To be a paramedic  I drove a lot of tow trucks  I  I  I  I worked in a  In a factory  That made airplane parts  And  Oh my god  I drove a lot of trucks  I parked cars  Good place to steal  I'm from too  By that  I  Did a lot of stuff  I tried to start 
[03:07:00]  A landscaping business  And  Cuddled on the grass  And  I painted houses  And  I  Sheld  Snow  I  Did  Jesus  My god  In heaven  I  I  Did so many  Things  I  I  I worked in a lot  Of gas stations  Changed a lot of flat tires  Pumped a yellow  A lot of gas  And I  I  You know  I had this idea  About the acting thing  But it didn't really  Seem like a  Reality  When I started doing  Episodic television  I didn't really see  I didn't  I mean  Piers 
[03:07:30]  I don't know  I didn't have  Any of those  Because I was  Kind of a cowboy  I didn't realize  When I got off the plane  That a leather jacket  And motorcycle boots  Was a costume  You know  Yeah  You know  And you know  I didn't  It could be well  That it dawned on me  I went in  For a reading  Really early on  And  I  Was on my way to work  And so I had my  Union 76 stuff on  I had my blue shirt  Mike  You know  And my blue pants  And  You know  Then I went in to read 
[03:08:00]  For the part of this  Punk  Kid  Or the mean  Older brother  And  By the time I got to work  Raymond was very angry  Because I was getting  Phone calls  And  They said  You know what  The casting director  Just wanted to tell you  How brilliant  He thought it was  That you came in  Dressed as a blue collar  Person  It was just incredible  It just  Wow  You know  You have the part  You got the part  And what did you do  You have a western costume  And I was like  I was on my way to work 
[03:08:30]  Yeah  This is what I do  I rented this  From a fucking  Halloween store  They said  Jesus you guys  But  I kind of  I kind of  Realized  And I caught on  To the whole  Kind of  Oh okay  Well it's all  Make believe  And  It was a good lesson  Yeah  They couldn't  Accept the fact  That you were really  Going to a real job  I was making it up  Somehow  Years later  I was doing a western  In Augusta, Georgia  And  It was a part 
[03:09:00]  David Carradine  Was to have done  But having him  Pass away  It went to me  And when I got there  It was like 2 o'clock  In the morning  And the producer  Explained to me  That my wardrobe  Was in the room  And I went up there  And in the dark  And I opened it up  And there's this  Rack of clothes  And I turned on the light  And I looked at it  And I started going through it  And it was David's clothes  They had given me  Carradine's wardrobe  You know  And I  It's bad enough  That he died  I didn't need to see  These tags 
[03:09:30]  You know  With his name on it  And I called him  And I said  What in the name  I said  What  He's at David's clothes  And I said  Oh well  You know  I said  It doesn't fit  This stuff isn't  Going to fit me  I said  Oh my god  They said  Maybe you'd like a few  Anyway  The next day  They actually took me  To a Halloween store  In Augusta  To get my cowboy clothes  Oh shit  Yeah  It was one of those productions  I got my wardrobe  From a Halloween  Oh my god  This is a great film  There was a big 
[03:10:00]  There was a statue  Of James Brown  Right out in front  Of the store  And it's like  Kind of on a pedestal  It's like  I guess James Brown  Was from Augusta  And it's got this statue  Of James Brown  It was so funny  Because I went  And I looked at it  And it was so small  It was like tiny  There it is  Look at that thing  There it is  Yeah  Yeah  And then the guy  I was with him  He goes  Yeah  He didn't like it  When he saw it  He got mad  That wasn't bigger  He got mad  You know  But it's life size  But he got mad  He didn't like it 
[03:10:30]  So they put it up  On a pedestal  See they put it up  On a higher  To make it look  Like he's taller  To make it bigger  Yeah  Yeah look at that  That's pretty cool  That's kind of horrible  Actually  It was very strange  Getting my clothes  In a Halloween store  And the James Brown statue  The James Brown statue  See the Halloween store  Is right over there  He's pointing  Right behind that guy  Right  Right behind that guy  I was in there  Getting my wardrobe  How authentic  Could a cowboy  Outfit  Possibly look 
[03:11:00]  Bought at a Halloween store  Well I had to rummage around  For a little while  You know  The pre-packaged shit  They had  It just wasn't right  That sheriff outfit  With the little  I went around in the back  And I found a good hat  Which was the key  To the whole thing  Yeah  And then I went  And I found a  Yeah looking like  Marty McFly  Back to the future  I had some pants  And I was able  To put together  I got a little vest  I got my own shirt  And I got some nice pistols  On the set  You know  So it ended up okay  I got it together 
[03:11:30]  Took a while  What was the name  Of the movie  Can we see a picture  Of Michael from that  He's laughing  I don't know  Whatever happened  To that thing  I don't know  It was called  Sundown at noon  Or something  Did they ever release it?  I don't think so  I don't think it's finished yet  It might be in post production  It's the 5,000 other projects  On the IMDB  That I'm supposedly in  Yeah  Lies  God  You handle a lot of firearms  In movies  Are you comfortable with them?  Do you like shooting? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  I have a hard time  Sometimes watching  Other actors with weapons  Because  Sometimes they just  Don't look right  Holding it  You know  And you think  Well I got this gun  You know  It's going to be pretty good  But it isn't that at all  I can't explain it  So  The way you handle it  I think is  Very unique  I mean I think  Clint Eastwood  Is good with a gun  But it's not 
[03:12:30]  It's an intuitive thing  And not everybody can do it  I haven't  Rarely seen anybody  Who can handle a gun  Properly  Kirk Douglas could do it  Robert Culp could do it  Steve McQueen  Steve McQueen was pretty good  With the shotgun  With the 12 gauge  In the getaway  I have that gun  By the way  His son  Give it to me  Really  Yeah  It's a Winchester  That's very cool  But the gun thing  Is  I can't explain it  It just  Well I'm thinking back also  To Reservoir Dogs 
[03:13:00]  It almost looked like  It was an extension  Of your hand  Yeah  You were waving  You were gesturing with it  At one point  Yeah  It was like  He's fucking talking  With his gun  It was like  It was pretty good  Scratch your head  Yeah  It's a useful  It's a nice gadget  To have  In a movie  In a scene  It's like a cigarette  I mean you take  A cigarette away  From Humphrey Bogart  Yeah  You know  I mean  Bogie was Bogie  Let's face it  But when he put  That cigarette in his mouth  And lit it up  All of a sudden  It was a whole other thing 
[03:13:30]  Yeah  And you give me a gun  It's a whole different deal  I don't know why  My shoulder holster  Yeah  I didn't want to wear  That shoulder holster  It was too tight  You know what  The pants didn't match  My jacket  They were too tight  I had a t-shirt on  So when he tucked it in  It was way too tight  In the waist  And I didn't want to wear  That holster  Because it was  Very confining  But it was the outfit  And it was Quentin's idea 
[03:14:00]  I told everybody  To show up on the set  With black suits on  And I didn't even have one  So my pants  And the jacket  Don't match  If you look at Buscemi  He's got black jeans on  And he didn't have one either  What the fuck  Where was wardrobe  We got the ties  From wardrobe  The ties  The thin ties  And I was supposed  To wear black shoes  And I didn't have  Any black dress shoes  I had black cowboy boots  And that's why  I'm wearing them  In the movie  That almost makes sense  Though for the character  You seem like  The kind of guy  That would wear  Black cowboy boots 
[03:14:30]  That's all I had  And then when I got  The razor  I figured  Okay where am I  Going to put this thing  Ah the boot  Where am I going to put  In my fucking pocket  Well yeah  It just seemed  To make sense  To put it in the boot  But a lot of things  Happened that were  Not in the screenplay  And thank god  Quentin was decent enough  To let me get away  With a lot of stuff  The dance  Was that something  That he asked you to do  Or you just kind of  Knew to talk into the air  And dance  Well I'm no dancer  And I tried to explain  That to him  But in the thing 
[03:15:00]  It said  Mr. Blonde  Maniacally dances  Around the manacled cop  And I always remember that  And you know  I was always questioning  Well what do you mean  Maniacally  You know  You're supposed to be  All handcuffed  And then it turned  Into duct tape  Of course  But we never really  Rehearsed that  We rehearsed the whole movie  For like a week  Maybe a week and a half  Before we were shooting  And every time 
[03:15:30]  We got to that scene  I just said  Listen I don't want  To rehearse it  Because I don't know  What I'm going to do  And thank god  Quentin didn't force me  To do it  Because he obviously  Knew that I didn't know  What I was going to do  And I kept saying  I'll do it on the day  Yeah  When we're actually  Going to do it  I'll figure out  What to do  Because I'm good  If I'm backed  Into a corner  And I said  Listen I don't  I don't know  What I'm going to do  I really didn't  And then when they  Finally shot it  We did like  Four versions of it  The music was  Supposed to be  Barroom Blitz  By the Blasters 
[03:16:00]  Oh really  Because he didn't  Have the rights  To the Steelers wheel  And so I did it  To Steelers  Because I knew  That that was  The one he wanted  And the talking thing  It's very subtle  The little dance  Is very subtle  It's very understated  It's great  Yeah yeah yeah  It's a subtle  Little move  I suddenly had  To do something  And then I had  The damn ear  In my hand  And when I  You know I was  Supposed to walk  Out of frame  But then actually  He picked me up  Coming in the frame 
[03:16:30]  And I was holding it  And you know  It's funny when you  Watch yourself  Because you see  Things that other  People don't see  But I see myself  Thinking because  I was thinking  What am I going to do  Oh really  What am I going to do  With it  And he was going  Throw it  Throw it  Toss it  And I  Didn't really want  To do that  Yeah  So I said  Hey can you hear me  That was his ear  Right  Hey can you hear me  And then I threw it  After that  But the dance is great  Because it really is  That's the way 
[03:17:00]  A sociopath who can't  Dance  Would dance  Absolutely  There's a little spin  A little backlog  They're not good moves  That's just what you do  You're massacring a man  Like a lunatic  Yeah it was time  To get the razor out  Because I wanted  To stop dancing  Yeah  The perfect way  To stop the dance  The song is just  Synonymous with this scene  Now I think  Anytime you hear that  God damn  I'm like an animal  It's brutal  No I said  I told him  I said  Kirk I'm going to  Jump on you  Like an animal  There was no other 
[03:17:30]  Way to do it  Except mount him  It's just  I realized you had  I mean imagine  It wouldn't be easy  So now you're  Hashing this out  In your head  Yeah and Quentin's  Going throw it  Throw it  Throw it  See I didn't want to  I just didn't  Really  I just turned around  Like  It was like  Three  Then you laugh  At him  It was like  Three days later  He goes  You remember 
[03:18:00]  When you talked  In the air  And I go  Yeah  And he goes  It's in the movie  And I never  Really thought  That it wasn't  Going to be  So it's kind of  Another lesson  For me  Because  I wasn't in control  As much as I  And then when he  Then when he goes  Outside  We were talking  About this earlier  It's fucking amazing  What's great too  Is that when he  Holds the ear  And he fucking  Throws it  Then you look  At your hand  Annoyed that there's  Blood on it  And you almost  Wipe it on his shirt  Accusingly  Like an asshole  Well it's movie blood 
[03:18:30]  It's very sticky  And there's the car  You could own  Well you see me  Trying to get my  Keys out of my pocket  My hand was all  Sticky from the blood  And the fucking  Keys were like  Stuck in my pocket  By the third time  I did it  Poor Kirk was  You know  He was covered in it  Yeah  Now was your character  Supposed to have  Just had a can of  Gasoline for emergencies  Or did you  Specifically get it  To burn this guy up  No I went to get it  For that purpose  Oh okay 
[03:19:00]  Yeah that one makes  Sense  I tried to explain  To Quentin  That um  If in fact  I had  Set him up  If I blazed him up  Can you imagine  The horror  Of him  Burning in flames  At the same time  I'm being shot  By Mr. Orange  Now that would have  Been pretty powerful  Yeah no shit  You know  You know  That torched him  And oh my god  See I think  That would have been  A lot more disturbing 
[03:19:30]  In the way that  It actually is  But I think he was  Pretty fed up  Of my suggestions  At that point  He had had it  With you  Yeah he had  Because every day  I had something new  So I made all this up  Man this was just me  That's apple juice  By the way  Oh wow  Yeah  It's the same color  As gasoline  Oh hey  She's handy to know  Learn something  See I'm gonna throw  The can  Now  What's the matter  Don't do this  Please 
[03:20:00]  Did that burn a little bit  Burn a little bit  What a prick  Oh god  On his fucking cut ear  You sure don't like  Police officers in this  Well you know  Oddly enough  I've got a lot of cops  Who are very nice to me  Yeah  Through the years  After this  And I've always found  Perplexing  Perplexing indeed  I was in  I was in Dallas Texas  And um  Don't  Please don't  I went to see  The chief of police  And he had a 
[03:20:30]  Mr. Blonde poster  Oh shit  Don't throw  Well done  Don't  Don't  I can imagine  If I would have dropped it  Yeah  There you go  That was Tim's big moment  But you see his gun  Is empty  Yeah  And he goes like this again  Even though there's no bullets left  Which was kind of  Overdramatic  I thought  Yeah it was a little  Overdramatic  And then he drops the clip  And now he's going to go  Like this again  Because he didn't know  What else to do  See  He's delirious  From bleeding 
[03:21:00]  That was so true  I love you  That's funny  All right Tim  You know  You've had your moment  You know  Delirious  Lay down  Okay  I actually wanted to have  The zippo in my hand  Still lit  When Chris Penn  Comes in  And he sees me  On the floor  I wanted to have  The zippo  Still going  I wanted Chris  To lean over  And blow it out  But you know 
[03:21:30]  Quentin  I was like  He was so angry  At me at that point  He was like  No  No  No  We're not going  To do it that way  I was like  Okay man  It must have been  Some great discussions  Between the two  I love the breakdown  Of the scene  But what's great too  Is the horrible strategy  To actually  You're trying to hide out  In that place  To actually burn  The cop alive  Like that wouldn't draw  Attention to the hiding spots  You're waiting for  Fucking Joe  To get rid of the loot  Where's Joe  At that point 
[03:22:00]  Well I don't care  But in the meantime  I'm going to start a fire  And burn a cop alive  That won't cause any noise  Because I have to  Five gallons of gasoline  In the middle of a wooden warehouse  I'm angry  Not even trying to help  The guy that shot  You're too busy  Setting the guy on fire  You're a horrible guy  To work with  That was great  You're hysterical  I feel like the breakdown  It's amazing  It's like  The stuff that made 
[03:22:30]  The scene so interesting  Like the stuff  That was so fucking  Great about it  Was just kind of  He just let him  Do what he wanted to do  Which is great  Yeah  No he did the same thing  Until Bill  Pretty much  Oh really  He didn't want me  To wear that hat  And he didn't want me  To have long hair  And didn't want me  To wear that white cowboy hat  But then you can't imagine  It being another way  Any different  Well I've been in Mexico  Making a western  And I got that Stetson  In Durango  And I was wearing it  To the  They have Halloween shops  In Mexico  I was a real Stetson 
[03:23:00]  And I kept wearing it  To the read throughs  And there he is  And Quentin says to me  You're not going to wear  That hat  And I said  Well yes I am  And he goes  No you're not  You're going to cut your hair  And I go  No I don't think so  And so we had this  Little kind of  Silent war going on  And I think  By the third  Read through  I had become 
[03:23:30]  Concerned about Uma  Because she would not  Make eye contact  With me  And I went to Quentin  And I said  Listen what's the deal  With Uma  And I said  You know  We got to do this  Thing together  And I got to have  You know  She doesn't seem  Like she wants  To communicate with me  I'm a little concerned  And he goes  No no no  It's just the way she is  And when we  Comes down to it  She's going to be there  And she'll be good  And I said  Alright you know  And I was leaving  And he goes  Oh yeah yeah  And I go  What  And he goes  You know  Now I can't picture you 
[03:24:00]  Without the hair  I can't picture you  Without the hair  So we're going to do it  And I said  Oh well  Okay  But then after  About a week  Of shooting  I did the stuff  With  David  At the trailer  And then we're out  In Bakersfield  I'm supposed to be  Doing the strip club  And he comes to my camper  And he gives me sides  He wrote a scene  And he gives it to me  And he goes  This is what we're  Going to shoot today  And I said  Okay  And I read it 
[03:24:30]  And it's the scene  Where the guy tells me  To take off my  Fucking hat  Right  So he wrote a scene  To make me get rid  Of the hat  What an asshole  Yeah  You know  He set me up  Man  He let me get comfortable  He knew I wanted it  He knew it was my  It was  Yeah  It was my strength  Right  I had the hat  You know  And then he made me  Take it off  Because then I didn't  Have a choice  Because it was in the script 
[03:25:00]  Like oh shit  Now I can't say no now  Right  He probably toiled  How could I get him  To take that fucking hat off  For a while  Before he realized  I'll just put it in the script  Yeah  That's what he did  That's a genius  Okay  That really is  But the thing is  Is when I took it off  I don't think he really  Fully anticipated  The emotional  Empathy  That I was going to get  Because you really  Kind of were like  Oh man  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Oh Bud  Did I take out his hat  You should have had 
[03:25:30]  A smaller hat underneath  Bud was bummed out  A little tiny one  Like those  Like those Clinton things  Every time you take one off  There's another one  Under here  Yeah a little  So finally  There's like this  Fucking thing  Tiny little  Is this one okay  What about this one  Oh man  That's  Who knew  Kill Bill was all about  The hat  Yeah  It was  Everyone was obsessed  With the hat  It was a sympathetic  Scene for you  That became the moral  Center of the film  Right  Yeah  Right to the scene 
[03:26:00]  Just so you get rid of it  It was  God  What a thing to do  Right  Did she not make  Eye contact with you  Because of the way  You guys were kind of  Playing  Like you know  She was kind of  Supposed to not like you  I think  A little  Well  I mean everybody  All actors have their own  Way of getting to this  Psychological place  They need to be  And I think maybe  She was just trying  To fill me out  And just trying to  Figure out what  I was going to do  Or  Let's face it  I mean  I had to do some  Pretty bad things  With her  And some pretty 
[03:26:30]  Mean things  And I think she was  Just trying to  Find her way around me  Or trying to figure out  What I was doing  And maybe she was  Trying to throw me off  I don't know  But the first thing  We did was the thing  In the graveyard  And  When I first went  To the set  Her stunt double  Was in the back  Of the truck  All tied up  With belts and stuff  And I went  Oh god  You know  I'm going to play  This whole thing  With a stunt double  But then  After we did  The blocking  And then 
[03:27:00]  I came to shoot  My god  There she was  And so  And she started  Looking at me then  And  I realized  It was just  Her way of preparing  Hmm  She ended up  Being great  And I love  Our stuff together  I blew the whole  Front of the camera  Off with that shotgun  By the way  Really?  She watched  When she comes in  The whole front  Of the camera?  Yeah  I blew the whole lens  Off the camera  Bam  Wow  I had it right up  Against the lens  And  But the shells 
[03:27:30]  Were rock salt  And when I test  I did a test fire  Outside with it  And  It was just like  A big cloud of dust  Come out  And so  They were thinking  That it wasn't  Going to really  Hurt the camera  And they kept  Telling me  To do it  Over here  And over here  And over there  And Quentin said  No, no, no  I want you to  Point it right  In the lens  And I said  Yeah, I think so too  So  They loaded me up  And they  You know  It should have had  Some plexi  In front of it 
[03:28:00]  Or something  But it was so close  I think they were  Worried about a reflection  But  When I fired that thing  It blew the whole  Front of it  Wow  Like a $50,000  Panavision  Wow  Yeah  When I come out  At that door  Her sword  Was laying on the ground  And I kicked it  And it spun around  In the air  And stuck right  In that barrel  Back there  It went around  Like a pinwheel  And stuck right  In the barrel  Really?  Yeah  That was pretty crazy 
[03:28:30]  That's a good trick  I only have one bracelet  On there too  You see  And in the stills  Of the movie  I have two bracelets  Because I forgot  To take mine off  I love these little  These little details  That's great  All I want to do  Is watch movies  With me  Yeah, no kidding  That's all I want to do  I picked out that shirt too  I still have that shirt  It is very you  When I'm looking at that shirt  This is a spit  Now you know who really  Was spitting  In her face  Was Quentin  Really? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah  See, she spit at me  But then  They gave her a plunger  See  Oh  Oh  See, some of the spits  In my face  Were Quentin spitting at me  Oh  Some of her  Was him spitting at her  Because he wanted to be  A specific, precise  Certain way  See, she's completely  A toy now  And there goes the needle  Right in the butt  Yeah  They had a lot of volunteers  That night  And I think every girl  On the crew  Did a take of their butt 
[03:29:30]  In Uma Thurman jeans  To get a needle in the butt  Wow  And the shot in the movie  Just now  That was Quentin  Who stuck it in the ass  That wasn't me  He gets all the good  He gets all the good jobs  He came over  And he says  Alright, alright, alright  You've done enough  He goes  You know  I'm going to do  The needle in the butt  And I was like  Alright  Mr. Director  Does Quentin have a foot fetish?  I've heard that  Yeah  Because there's  Every shot  Every movie 
[03:30:00]  Yeah  Has some kind of shot  With a girl's feet  And yeah  Yeah, he kind of does  But you see  He  In fact  I was supposed to wear  Two different colored cowboy boots  I was going to have  One red one  The red python boot  And then I was going to wear  A black one  On the other foot  It was my idea  To have the two different  Cowboy boots on  And there's one scene  In the picture  When we're massacring  Everybody at the wedding  I do have the two  Different boots on  But then later on  He was like  No, no  That's too much 
[03:30:30]  I don't want the  Two boot thing  I was like  Alright  Okay, whatever  I didn't get away  With that one  But man  That's kind of a foot thing  Sounds like you guys  Got long  Didn't apply to men  Yeah, we did too  Didn't apply to men  I just did the friar's roast  Of him in New York City  Right, right on  They actually made me a friar  I am officially a friar  Oh, really?  New York City, yeah  God bless those guys  Quite an honor  To be a friar  That's pretty cool 
[03:31:00]  There's a lot of  Old school guys  Freddie Roman  Frank Sinatra  Dean Martin  They don't show up  So much anymore  They're all over the wall  Their pictures  Their pictures are on the wall  Good enough  You see that  I got two bracelets on  Now, see  Ah, yeah  A little flub there  A little flub  A little flub  She was good too  Daryl Hanna was enjoyable  I'm going to go home now  And watch this fucking movie  Yeah, I think so  It gets me psyched  It's such a good movie  She lives in Malibu  I see her all the time 
[03:31:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, she's nice  Sometimes people think  Deanna is Daryl Hanna  Wasn't that her own car  In that too?  No, that's mine  A Trans Am  Yeah, wasn't that hers?  No?  No, I took that  I actually acquired that  While we were shooting  So  What don't you take  From the set?  He takes whatever he wants  He's going to tell him no though  You can work things out  You know  If you approach the subject  Make some DLG  What's the coolest piece of movie memorabilia you have?  I have that sword that's in my hand 
[03:32:00]  Yeah  Oh, damn  That's nice  Oh my god  I got this Detson  The Steve McQueen  Gone  I guess the Steve McQueen shotgun  That's pretty cool  That's probably the best thing I got  And I had it ID'd by the weapons handler  That made the original Peckinpah film  I was making a picture called Species  And Bobby  Bobby Vesiglio was the weapons handler  And he had been the weapons handler  On the original getaway  And I told him I had the shotgun 
[03:32:30]  And he goes  You don't have it  And I said  Yes, I do  I said  Steve's kid gave it to me  And he goes  Yeah, you don't have it  And I said  I'm going to bring it over here  And show it to you  And he goes  All right  I got my books  And I'm going to look it up  I have the numbers and everything  And I said  Okay  I wrapped it up in a red bath towel  And I put it in my trunk  And when I got to this set  I said  Bobby  I have it  And he comes walking over  And I open the trunk  And he said  Okay, man  And I started unrolling it  And the minute he saw it 
[03:33:00]  He had his books with him  And the minute he saw it  He just went  Okay  And he used to walk away  I said  What are you doing?  He goes  That's it  That's how good he was  He just knew it by sight  So that's all the identification I needed  That's pretty  Yeah, that's a great piece of that  It's a nice ratchet  12-gauge pump  What was your favorite movie?  You've made a lot of movies  You know  I played an Irish-American prize fighter  In a picture called  Strength and Honor  That never got out there 
[03:33:30]  And never got any distribution  I think it got caught somewhere  Between the wrestler  And the fighter  And  You know  It still has a chance  To be  Something good  If it could get  Distribution  Could get properly released  I think it's a  Really damn good film  It's a very emotional thing  There's no  Guns  Or cigarettes  Or anything  It's about a father  And a son  And I accidentally kill 
[03:34:00]  Another fighter  In the ring  In a prize fight  And I promise my family  I'm never going to fight again  And then  My little boy is sick  And  He can get an operation  In Los Angeles  The whole thing  Takes place in Ireland  And so I agreed to do this  Big bare knuckle fight  In this gypsy camp  With Vinnie Jones  And the prize money  To save my kid  And it's  You know  It's funny  Because you do a film like that  And you see it 
[03:34:30]  And you know how good it is  And you know what it could do  It could completely change  The course of your life  And your career  And then you find out  About the underbelly  Of the industry  And what really goes on  With distributions  And knee slapping  And all kinds of deals  That are made with  People that want a certain thing  In a certain place  And  You're really  Really hard to get in there  Especially with an independent film  And  It's still possible  Because I know  The director  And some of the guys  Are still trying really hard  To get it in the theaters 
[03:35:00]  And get it released  But  It's  That's a good one  I mean if I had to pick one out  I guess that would be it  Is there any way we could see it?  I  I know  You can't just buy it online  Or something  Netflix  Yeah  Something  Netflix  That's a poster of it  See  It's right there  I mean look how many awards  This thing got  It got like 38 nominations  I got best actor  In Boston Film Festival  It got best picture  Best director  Best actor  In New York  Independent  Film Festival 
[03:35:30]  Did you get into Tribeca?  No  I never went to Tribeca  But I did everything else  Los Angeles  New York  Boston  I remember when you were in here  A couple years ago  You were talking about this  You've been really pushing this  For a couple years now  Well you know  I'm really indebted  To Mark Mahan  The director  And the guys in Ireland  To put up the money for it  And  It's such a beautiful story  And it's a different side of me  Or  Or maybe not  It's just  At least it was  Not to kind of move you  I mean 
[03:36:00]  I think a lot of people saw it  And they were like  Oh my god  I think  I think it kind of  Concerned  Some people  Who would be very happy  To keep me in the box  As the bad guy  Oh really?  And  Yeah  And  But you know  It's there  It's there  Who knows  What will happen  Some day  Do you just walk  Into some places  And see some people  And go like  Oh this guy  Like you just know  What the guy's all about 
[03:36:30]  Hollywood insider bullshit  Yeah  Happens all the time  Yeah  Do you  Are you  Are you good at  Playing the game though  Like  It seems like  You're a pretty  Straightforward  Kind of  Hey  Go fuck yourself  Kind of guy  Yeah you know  To a certain degree  I am that way  But I've also realized  That being that way  Sometimes can be  Very misconstrued  You know  You can be in a room  With 50 people  And sign 50 autographs  And have 50 conversation  But that 51st person  Who might want to talk to you  When you're leaving 
[03:37:00]  Or when the building's on fire  Or maybe you know  You have something  Really important to do  And you don't have  That much time  For that one person  That one person  For the rest  Of their entire life  On earth  Will say  I met Michael Madsen  That fucking asshole  You know  He's a prick  He's drunk  He's a jerk  You know  He fucking blew me off  You know  It's really kind of  A mixed bag of tricks  You really  You speak your mind  And you talk about  A lot of things  That a lot of people 
[03:37:30]  Know are true  But you can't really say it  Because if you do  You're going to be  Put out of the business  For saying it  So it's kind of  A  It's a very  Very strange  I mean  Look at this whole thing  With Charlie Sheen  Is going on  But you know  I'll tell you a story  About Charlie  When my friend  Christopher Penn died  Sean called me up  To be a pallbearer  At Chris's funeral  And I was carrying  That box  Into the chapel  And I was really shattered  I mean 
[03:38:00]  It was one of those times  In my life  Where I just couldn't  Put it together  And I was  Really crying  Like heavily  And I had been  For a couple of days  And I was really  Destroyed  And I was walking  Up the thing  With him  And I just  It started to happen  Again in the  In the church  And I was crying  So hard  And I felt  Somebody come  Over and put  Their hand  On my shoulder  Who started  To walk  Behind me  When I was  Carrying the  Box  And I looked 
[03:38:30]  Behind me  And it was  Charlie  You know  I had made  A picture  With Charlie  In Arizona  We made a  Motorcycle picture  Together called  Beyond the Law  And we went  Crazy when we  Were making  The film  And obviously  And all these  Other things  That are going  On with him  But you know  What  On that day  When I was  Walking in that  Church  Carrying my  Dead friend  And I was  So sad  Charlie come over  Put his hand  On my shoulder  You know  Nobody else  Did that  That day  So for whatever  That means 
[03:39:00]  You know  Yeah now he's  He has empathy  He's  You know  Yeah  It was  I think  You know  It's so insane  How people get  There's like a  Parade  When people go down  Look at what they  Were doing  To Michael Douglas  When he was sick  I was in a market  And I saw  A newspaper  Had this picture  Of Michael Douglas  Looking down  And like this  And he looked  Terrible  Like he was  Already dead  And it said  The final days 
[03:39:30]  The final seconds  It's over  You know  Kirk flies in  Catherine Zeta-Jones  Collapses in the airport  It's done  You know  And this is where  He's going to be buried  And right next to it  There was a  People magazine  Or an Us magazine  With this really  Nice picture  Of Michael  And it says  I haven't given up  I feel stronger  Every day  And you look at  These two  And funny  And you go  Who's telling  The truth  You know  And then when  He got better  I was watching  Television  And there was  One of these  Tabloid guys 
[03:40:00]  On TV  And he was saying  Michael Douglas  Has recovered  And he claims  That the press  Was glorifying  In his death  And the tabloids  Were relishing  The fact that  He was going down  Of course this isn't true  But these are  Michael's allegations  And I went  Wait a sec  I saw it  It was true  It was damn  You know  They were happy  Why do they do that  We were talking about  How they love  Just ripping people down  Like the Charlie Sheen thing  Is a prime example  Of people love saying  They want their privacy  And leave me alone  And when the press 
[03:40:30]  Comes up to them  Or the government  Wants to put a camera  Up somewhere  It's like  Hey hey privacy  But they're the first ones  To want to know  Every detail  Of what Charlie Sheen  Is taking  Who he's going out with  What he's saying  Yeah well  They want to vicariously  Live through the situation  I suppose  I just  And he's been saying  That though  He's been saying  Look  I'm living like a rock star  You people never will  So you can't even  Wrap your mind around  What I'm doing  Is what he was saying  Well  There's a certain amount 
[03:41:00]  Of sanity  To that statement  But  It's not going to  Spin that way  No  They're going to  Spin it back  Against him  You know  The flip side  Of the coin  Is you're lucky  To have a job  And make that kind  Of money  Yeah well  That's what  Everybody looks at  And you know  I think he's  Throwing it away  Well time will tell  I have no dire  Predictions for Mr. Sheen  I'm sure that he'll  Come out on the high side  CBS is in a weird  Position though  Normally the networks  Are just worms  But they're kind of  In a weird position  Because if something  Bad happens 
[03:41:30]  People are like  Well you saw this coming  And you know  And they're like  Look at Elliot Spitzer  He's got his own  Talk show  No kidding  For God's sakes  I mean come on  Everybody  You would have bet  A lot of money  Against that  People are trying  To get me to do  Reality shows  And meet the Madsons  You should  But when I look  Well my house  Is pretty funny  And pretty crazy  It was probably  A big hit  But when you look  When you look at  What happened  To the Hogan's  And the rest of them  And reality shows  You blast your  Whole family apart  Could get in the way  Yeah  I mean come on  I don't need  That kind of trouble 
[03:42:00]  I don't think so  You have to be on  Five seasons  Before they finally  Start paying  Oh is that the  Number  Five seasons  In the beginning  It's pretty grim  They don't give you  It's all a whole  Speculation  Yeah we don't know  We don't know  How this is going  To work out  So we're not going  To pay you a cent  Basically  If it's successful  Well then we'll  Renegotiate  But right now  We're just going  To play a game  And I'm like  No man  No thanks  Sorry  A built in audience  What the hell  You want to do that for  Turn my kids  Into celebrities
