<pre> one of his family and i think that we have a right to be a really young of  course it's open at the end  and we are a writer studio is filled right now i want that kind of me going  around and looking at hanging the and eating out of the tours that cookies  yes they had a ralph congrats on your first day  they did it is a right one  yeah that's the right one  thank you missus t  she said the cookies  i must say the first uh... shows i must say we are finally moving forward here 
[00:30]
 denny w yes we are very very excited at the uh... hiring of ralph to torrent a  guy i grew up listening to  you were co-workers weren't you we are co-workers for many years i'm very very  happy with this higher i must say because we're missing about everything  else around here i think the other call letters or no  uh... yeah we say b a b a ralph there was a lot  self of the long island contingency yes  and i'd like to think about  lucky buckman for more than a few hundred dollar we got to draw the line  somewhere that it's a crime out loud now it is a fact that i think that's what i 
[01:00]
 think that  it ends with the ralph but uh... i used to cut school and check out our out on  the radio and said that when i was just a punk  i'm still a part of the really really good about the fact that i got a job now  but i just want to welcome ralph i'm serious i was so excited  say is like what's wrong with you because i took my lunch and i sat in  front of my stereo cranking up ralph today because you never listen to me  though the way to know how to make it shut up and start listening now because  i'm excited once again well is that we're moving forward uh... the papers are 
[01:30]
 still printing on that uh... three people are upset about david not so i  are you on a star with that  well yeah we had a bunch of articles over the weekend a barge  they doubt they just can't stop writing about opiate anthony's and it's  interesting to keep uh... writing about is make sure you get our names right  that's all we care about  this is my favorite  david hinkley who uh... writes for the daily news  god we gotta call him because i am convinced this is a job it's gotta be a  joke 
[02:00]
 it has to be it has to be yes  let's say a couple of the notes that came here on former n.e.w. d.j. scott  muni dave herman two long-time voices of new york radio cut loose by the station  on november thirteenth  these are letters  from toms river new jersey  i guess scott never fired because they were deemed too old to rock and roll  if that's so how come no one told the old jocks over at cbsf m  can we start there 
[02:30]
 uh... because cbsf m  is an oldie station yes  so there's all jocks over there  ron london's cbsf m  hello love  that's fine  but when you're trying to rock and get an attitude here like any w used to have  you can have that and let's just uh...  put it straight here that they weren't fired zero  their fire because they didn't do anything in the ratings for many many  years right  we live and die by the ratings in the radio world tell works 
[03:00]
 uh... continuing  anyway i stopped listening to any w when they brought in those two jerks all p and  opi  all  and  this is interesting i'm dopy this time yeah usually it's doping and anthony  but this time it's all p and opi can i say that you want to get to us please  don't use the opi and opi are dopey and it and you know i'm not funny and all  that stuff about something better because it doesn't bother us we've heard  it before i don't come up with some of the make us chuckle right 
[03:30]
 who wants to listen to to howard stern wannabes  or howard stern himself for that matter  i think  uh... hell of a lot of people listen to have worked  uh... i think so  okay uh... you know as well as i do that scotty pioneer the very format howie  baby claims is his domain  no howie ought to kiss scott's but  scott was in the rock format and howard stern is in the talk format  so williams talking at his ass william haye 
[04:00]
 is uh... yes from toms river new jersey is speaking out of his ass yes  and then we go on to see the rest  and he can you know what  this is real  and i'm listening to any w for forty years  probably longer  no more no way  if you think i used to put my radio on it seven a m but i turned it off in the  afternoon because i can't stand  those two idiots  who who was she talking about 
[04:30]
 i thought maybe it was ralph  uh...  uh... yes give ralph some time  i don't listen to howard stern or i miss you  i just don't appreciate their humor  i guess it's my age  but bring back scott muni and dave herman  and i think now  cedar harest  eighty-year-old lady writing a letter to david hinkley any princess  david should know that we're not going for eighty-year-old listeners here at  any w  yeah yeah all we we we really were trying for that lucrative eighty-year-old 
[05:00]
 women uh... rating  so we can uh... tell sales they could start buying up those depend on the  garment spots yet does arbitrage even rate eighty-plus  i don't think so no they don't  so i don't know what we what he was getting out of david is getting at my  printing these uh... these letters are these  maybe the only letters he got about the subject  uh... whether any more people that are relevant to this to the twentieth  century 
[05:30]
 and these people right  i don't know  maybe we ought to talk to david because of david wants complaint letters we  could hand them up a ton of uh... only letters that are much better than the  ones he printed  i think he was going for the ones that uh... were pro  scott and dave right and anti-opin Anthony yeah  so the only way you can get those really are from the eighty-year-old  because i think everyone else realize it was time to move on here right at this  station hands ralph to tour everyone thank you  thank you ralph thank you ralph  okay what do we get screwed for the job the magic of things uh... gales in 
[06:00]
 today's paper and who i don't know we're in the paper all week  so apparently everyone isn't rooting for jobs in my jail  i don't be an anthony's every friday show someone made jill g the subject of  that wish  triggering around of marilyn roe jokes from the host  it was a met fan that said after the manager of because he's clinging to  life he's dying he's alive he's  he's passed out he's playing poker  the news of these helping out fellow patients right down east and the comment 
[06:30]
 we said was you know it is in a rundown between life and death that's all we  said and and all that's no different than the papers  don't you have to be clipper rallying in the late innings right  and they're saying the same thing in the newspapers print that stuff  the daily news is trash in us for talking about your domestic or they  already got your magic also bitch where he wrote in their job waiting for a  so ourself  right  any other press you want to talk about  now we have lawyers upstairs talking about friday show 
[07:00]
 it's just a mess around here i was a mess  well to seven w any doubly with our right in new york is open at the end if  you want to send a fax into the show to one two nine five seven  w any w i should just read a couple here at the main okay to be an anthony  what is sunday for new york football fan and we need to do the best games in a  long time could it be the jets heading for division title first one since  nineteen sixty nine  let's keep our fingers crossed and no matter how bad the giant season might be 
[07:30]
 they still  beat the broncos go new york let's hear it for the both teams  where's all these hundred dollars anthony i'll give you a hundred dollars  but i got some to say  uh... anthony where's all these hundred dollars  they're coming in like crazy  screw  uh... the giants  we've got to say screw big blue this is my personal opinion book and i tell us  of all they said they saw call all season and now they decide  that they got a uh... play 
[08:00]
 against denver well let me first start by saying  i'm more of a jet stand in june stand but on friday i did say  that uh... the chance would be easily cover the spread and would possibly be  the broncos for the biggest upset of the season big blue big blow you didn't  believe me  you bet me a hundred dollars  i win i want my money  all right don't worry about it  i don't well shan what's your problem with uh... big blow  they played a great game yesterday what why can't they do that uh... 
[08:30]
 consistently i'll tell you why  cuz they they decide because all the uh... hype and pressure  about playing an undefeated team  that now they're going to decide to play  now it's important i'll tell you they do it from the beginning all p i'll tell  you what okay go ahead okay a lot of people out there think the giants have a  really bad team they don't have a bad team they have a horrible offense in  general  okay they have a very very good defense the problem this year is that the  defense for big blow has spent 
[09:00]
 a lot of time on the field  and their poll is pretty much wear out the defense and finally start scoring  because the giants can't get anything going offensively this year  the like the little did like the gorky kid that that rex it for the the real  athletes  what do you mean  uh... come on denver going on the way to be undefeated and and and uh... the  crap all the team has to be a dumb way do you want to that horse to the  quarterback to go on the field this year  and what the giants to be done by the lines that deserve to uh... no one in 
[09:30]
 new york wants to see john l way have an undefeated season i'm sorry  i'm sorry and giants didn't deserve to beat them they played like that uh...  they played a great game yesterday yes so it was that they could play a good  game  you're just better because you lost a hundred dollars  please  now my team the jets  look at a fantastic last night  very good yes you're absolutely right and i'm i'm excited for uh... then go  out to buffalo and kicking the bill's ass and winning a division 
[10:00]
 what it does that i'm happy for you if they can have so happy for you  it all i ask is that if bill parcels could just put away that stupid timing  pattern play that he likes to do  really you know the time and i don't play to the core of the end zone  now i wasn't familiar with that open  seriously i'm not i'm not i've been a few like a r or  or do you care or you want me to just a mobile i'd i don't know i basically  pay you money so i don't feel very good i don't get basically it's a play where 
[10:30]
 many you know steps back and just causes it to the core of the end zone okay  well both of you know guys are running it's it's called the uh... a timing  pattern right  it doesn't work  and yesterday they throw it again and they got intercepted in a and i was  just very frustrated the week  uh... prior to that uh... they tried to a three times it doesn't work  get rid of it  i don't i personally don't uh... think that was a giant touchdown yesterday  either  uh... ike  i saw that i saw the official come in and he waved it off shut up and then i 
[11:00]
 feel somebody else had to come in another official and and given the  touchdown  i'd personally that uh...  now i i saw the replay right  i thought i'll think it's a like  yeah that's not a doubt that school and that is not a touchdown i see the  replays like  alright that is so it's not a point you were losing a hundred dollars to  they were going to cover the point spread i didn't know  well they can't even hold on to a ball i thought maybe uh... they could have uh...  and before we finish our sports break here 
[11:30]
 met sonny ricky henderson  what is who's really excited about this ricky ought to keep his mouth shut and  count his blessings he's already saying you know they're better than anything  that's a better than the yankees people that's what i he's saying now let me  tell you know thing here i'm more of a mess in the yankees fan i think this  ricky henderson signings  is stupid  you're a shut up  did people forget that his average drastically dropped to like two thirty  last year the guy can't hit anymore  now he could still run like a mother i get 
[12:00]
 like a lot  mother i get  excuse me  all age  yeah all hot hot  mulligan  all of them because still run for you on a car i get a lot of other right  met signing ricky stupid  uh... right  not bright thank you  well i i i thought you were going off a little more about it uh... earlier  when i heard you are saying  uh... telling me about ricky saying that uh...  the match building the then the yankees what did you say he's on drugs 
[12:30]
 they're not  a pimple on them at the beginning of a pimple on the eighties and  why  pearl  dead fighting words are all huge  huge and different  and uh... they gave ricky henderson uh... william a's number  yeah come what they thought that now granted william a's had a couple of  really bad years with the mad  but it's still william a's now  and only one of the guy since may's retired for the number it was like a  fluke or something i work for half a season of some stupid 
[13:00]
 and i was part of ricky's demands anyone has twenty four  so have fun with your little number twenty four ricky  uh...  it's just a  stupid stupid  trade well stay tuned for more on my command dog  uh...  well this whole town's excited right now you know both teams look great both  policies look great uh... over the weekend trying to  uh...  dollars and they may prove they can be a team like denver 
[13:30]
 what the hell happened in the rest of the year that was going to happen with  so much pressure they could play like that all the time i want to hear it  anthony was going to happen eventually cuz they have a very good defense  they get their offense figure on the uh... the offseason they're gonna have  a pretty good uh... team next year it takes all the hype  for them to perform  perform out before the hype  uh... yet  uh...  just take the last time 
[14:00]
 uh...  wane shepard and old dylan song everything  is broken it's open and then i meant rocket and rolling here yeah  and uh... we we were talking on the way in and we both uh... got rocked into  getting our christmas trees uh... today well it's it's christmas  christmas time you have to go out and get everything  and get you i was supposed to do yesterday  but um...  how was it happening 
[14:30]
 long over well i want to brunch  into a a few but those branches where you pay a  ten bucks for the food in the bill comes in you drink a hundred dollars  bloody marys and mimosas and  yeah so uh... we were supposed to get the christmas tree  went to brunch  and then uh...  and is what the chance and uh...  and happen can't get the trick  that happened  and play that it is a dream ball  get the tree to jump to see can't get the tree that 
[15:00]
 i was a mess  yes we got it today  well i i i got yesterday  and uh...  i don't know i'd probably should have tied it on the top of the car  but they even have  i guess sports truck and my name and  but seats down throw in the back let's go i don't want to wait around  so many people to my car you can you put on time i know i i guess that's the  whole deal you put on top and tie it down i couldn't be bothered as i just  throw in the back of my car were out of here and have a rack on top to the 
[15:30]
 united so you you barely even have to tie it and you're right on what can i  tell you  so i could get away with it  told the dead thing out  maybe that i got a bad tree because there's probably needles in my car right  now that's you know that's you in your car  now it's gonna pine needles in it yes say we have we get these arguments uh...  all the eats in my car and i hated eats in his car and  now he puts trees in there and his needles all over  i'd hide the tree to my roof will make those not to get me as inside let me 
[16:00]
 tell you so i was buying uh... sports utility trucks way before they became  pass a  pass and not pass a way before they became popular sorry i had to run work  and uh... i'd use my sports utility truck for what it was built for you  throw the stuff in the back and yet and you go four wheel and then you go see it  but the tree can go on top i guess you're right  well i put the tree on top of the  and that's my fifty dollar tree stand was in the back  who liked  what you've got a 
[16:30]
 well over the past few years  i've had quite a difficult time with tree stands  first i went with the red and green metal one that you remember when you were  a kid with the green arms yeah i i've got a little  yeah i'm past that stage that things a nightmare  and and you can never get it straight and never stand up straight is a  straight straight up okay you lean away and it's it's tilted and you try to pull  it in  the water in their last for three minutes right and but when you use that  stand you got a like use the rope to tie it to doors and stuff you do not 
[17:00]
 secure it's gonna fall over exactly  last year  i'd throw that one away and i get the big green one  that fits like it  a gallon of water  this got the big screws that screw right into the okay that's the one i got  what was the problem with that  well this is a heavy base you can get a lot of water and the screws are kind of  a pain to screw into the general what  if if it's going to lean over on you  the damn thing is going to tip over on you 
[17:30]
 did you get it straight up and down  it looked pretty straight  and it would look pretty straight yeah you wait the content  so i got uh... is talked into getting this stand how much did the trees there  they cost a little bit of a box  fifty dollars for a tree stand  you've got to be lying  this thing is this thing there that is worth fifty dollars well lp  but you you put this  that with with uh... the the stem of the tree goes you you you put it into this  big round unit 
[18:00]
 that has these  gear looking things on the gears  then you pop it into the trees that and it swivels up  and you can adjust it  uh... until it's great so it's kind of locked in place with like a ball bearing  type of thing it's this big gap ball joint with gears on it all right i got  teeth on it and then you move it until where you get you got  and get it straight and then you push this pedal  and it locks it in place  so it's straight up and down 
[18:30]
 oh my god  how did i make in so many years without the fifty dollar tree stand that did you  see the advertisement for the tree stand after brunch yesterday or before brunch  that's all i want to know all maybe that's  uh... yeah  uh... we think that's not like one of those late night gadgets you say  discussed it during brunch  you got talked into the fifty dollar tree stand here  after some absolute uh... your tree stand cost more than your tree at this  point 
[19:00]
 i think you're right and i can't wait for the tree stand to go bad and you  can't hear him and you can go play  because you know it's going to happen  for fifty dollar tree stand  you know i didn't really think about it so now  what's wrong with you know i'm in the tree  well we don't  now the trees just kind of there i don't know when i'm going to decorate it  now you know one step at a time  you left it out on the porch or something for a whole night 
[19:30]
 without water  uh... get those needles be fall off in a week really only needed to last what  where we down to ten days and i was done with christmas shopping at right now  i don't i only need to last ten days  i know when these people that keep it up until february  uh... that's me  crip really  christmas is over let's get them tree of the house and move on with our lives and  and they believe we had a great christmas i like having a fire hazard in  the living room  really guy you take it out in early february and this just not thousands 
[20:00]
 upon thousands of needles  somewhere was standing all the way to the front door we tried to know right  yet  anthony pepsi one  but they see you got a bottle of it in your hand there i was brought a uh...  bottle of this  now one thing i think you know about me  i drink a lot of soda  i hate diet soda  so when i was handed this on my time  let me taste it  he's tasting the the pepsi one 
[20:30]
 doesn't taste like diet soda really it doesn't  i grew up with my mother  with a refrigerator full of diet soda  and i used to steal it  we can't let me drink this for your track  yeah  uh... you know when i was twelve right guys like  it was horrible  because it had a saccharin  this doesn't have saccharin  no sugar it's a brand new  pepsi one and it tastes like regular cola  uh... that doesn't taste like a pepsi soda at all 
[21:00]
 it doesn't taste like diet  it tastes like regular  okay i like it  and no other software and has this new sweetener i'm told  no  it's special it's very special yes i see you're just about done with that pepsi  one there's i must be enjoying it  is it about three or four sodas per show  and it's never diet because diet sodas always taste horrendous okay they have  that aftertaste 
[21:30]
 but this uh... it tastes like  okay taste like pepsi  anthony cigars around the world the original cigar the month club this is a  great idea for christmas you don't want to go trudging around the malls it's a  crowded you can't park  you could do this by phone a website if you have a cigar aficionado that you  know or somebody that  you think might like cigars  for our christmas i don't smoke a lot of cigars but if someone gave this to me  this holiday season i'd be pretty stoked  and i quite a lot of this is kind of cool  and for only twenty four ninety five per month plus shipping cigars around the

[23:00]
 well i love christmas controversy here at the  radio station opening  well uh...  obviously uh... i don't  think everybody knows but with w i n s wins ten ten wins news is upstairs  we got to meet the gang at our christmas party friday yes we did  high  the time from ten ten wins  this is my friend bob  bob and then they can only talk to us in ten minute intervals  what was that all about  yeah  that you give us twenty two minutes 
[23:30]
 uh... tell you  my life  but that that that is going to be done you know  for all the people you know  but i don't get to be a at the bar on the ones  quickly on the ones  yeah every every five minutes someone had to leave another guy had to come up  with the time and now with the financial report  and then i you guys are called  it was great to meet them  and other boss introduces us to the whole staff  because a lot of the the winds people i want to know what we look like all my 
[24:00]
 guy one of the a whole look like basically yeah that was pretty much  if you don't like  the up on the dance floor you know  uh... we had our party at christmas party  and he goes i want to bring up all the and anthony down so i think it's a bit  look like you know say a couple of words  i had told everybody it wins that i love their traffic on the ones yes  and they appreciated that yes i will  a little pause nearly anthony  then i give open the mike  and what did you say open  to better traffic is never accurate yeah 
[24:30]
 and they're all i got out of the in the whole night people coming up to me going  i love your show at  boy you're the you're the nice one i hate that all b  what was he saying about our traffic i think they take it seriously  that's their  did that's what they do that's a whole day  that they did their their new york  up there when they they did the news happens  and and traffic and what they they know it  they tell it in your bullfin on and then our boss got her vote me in a really 
[25:00]
 bad position  i thought you get fired at the christmas party  you hear the horror stories every year that people get fired at the christmas  party stuff yeah  he looks at me and it gives me the mike again says oh but i i bet you're  wondering how many people are  part of the tuesday night armor club in the room  and and i'm here talking like this wives and husband has dressed up you know  obviously a lot of people just simply not into what  you and i do  yeah like that i was going to have to do that so i turn around and go actually  boss everyone wants to know if you remember the tuesday night over club 
[25:30]
 and also the whole place was like  did he just say that  and i was just talking to him  how could he get fired so fast  oh no and then the boss drastically changed the subject and said okay it's time to  dance whatever we moved on but uh... yes we did we were big hit at the  christmas party  it was fun  i like meeting all those people yeah it was great uh... meeting carol miller 
[26:00]
 six-foot eight husband who values tall who looked at me the whole night like  you want to kill me well our little controversy a couple months back but  uh...  nice gunny yet so it's fun to to meet the people that you trash at the  holiday party uh...  it was just brutal  but there's a little controversy here now in the building  upstairs  uh... there's a little nativity scene  on one of the tables up there  and now it's starting up controversy worry i don't know it's like this whole  thing going on you can put in the tivity scene 
[26:30]
 and i think there's even a manor  up there  representing hanukkah  and and there's still a problem  because i don't think one's is represented  is that what the problem is that i think so  well let's get one of those quans uh... afro trees then  is that what  what is the because you got the manor for hanukkah yeah you got the nativity scene  or a little christmas tree for uh... christmas yeah  squandered i think it's like a little afro bush  the chia head  yeah i like it like that like a chia pet or something you grow the chia head afro 
[27:00]
 or a bonsai tree that you shape into an afro i think that's what they do for  quants of all is that it  i think so i wasn't sure i didn't know if there was a uh...  an ornament  they could lay out that would represent quonser  i'm not here in as much of about quonser this year as i did in years past now  i don't know what i was going to be in  maybe someone could explain that to us  quonser  uh... are african-american listeners maybe they can explain that to us  was was there all those are like uh... you know where's our own all could maybe 
[27:30]
 enlighten us on quonser i didn't even think of that because i don't consider  our all black man does are also a break one's a  i was there all  and i will only got a celebrate quonser will find a rolling and get to the bottom  of that  yeah early as i was my he goes down the hall and why  he's the white is black man you'll ever meet in your life that is the truth  uh... so the cost of our since the winning end  i don't know maybe they'll have to get rid of it  i'd work my 
[28:00]
 because that's how i hear their own pay our own stuff around well uh... what's  what's up with quonser is it still  the big thing  i had no idea how to come in and you know it's not at all we celebrate  christmas this year  does the rest of the gang in the hood uh... celebrate quonser the people who  they don't catch all the crap like killed my brother what you do it meant  you had to celebrate the holiday of the devil man what you doing  uh...  on the other hand  are you living in our town 
[28:30]

[29:00]
 uh...  you know nothing about quonser really no  said said the truth  well well you know something we ought to enlighten ourselves a little bit  yeah well listen to work on is all about it was a call and i know this certain  on like st like uh...  things there there are these ideals  that quons is based on them  i believe there are seven  seven yes  i'm not sure maybe someone can enlighten us  son of quonser  other any quonser songs 
[29:30]
 yeah we can maybe we can make up a quonser song  and  but to be fun  anthony good news are listeners came to the rescue and i found a quonser song  thought it would be only fair to play a quonser song  because we're playing all these all these christmas songs today okay so would  you like to hear our quonser song are no way to find a bit yet okay  what are you doing 
[30:00]

 christmas we have our uh... christmas tree and uh... nativity scene  hannukah has the manoran  and we were wondering what quonser has yes  and we don't understand quonser all that well no i'd seem to know there are seven  principles  of quonser don't they have like seven candles or something like that's not like  the hannukah thing  so i'm hitting the computer  and i'm trying to research a little bit and see what these principles are and i  can i found a couple  so if you bear with me here's 
[31:30]
 but these are the principles of uh... once a while i whipped this out  that's what that's one that's one of the principal here here's another  and where the white women and there's another one i'd  i think this is the quonser site  right  now  so it's based on seven principles and you are found to the spark and i hear  the first one again because i talked over it  okay  alright  excuse me while i whipped this out  uh...  and this one i can look for the rest 
[32:00]
 and where the white women at  and so you got to  interesting you got to the principles and uh... you're looking for the other  five  and before someone kills me  you're not  alright all right man  very nice and i think you very much that was  no problem of the unbelievable and you have uh...  are we going to expose some of radios deepest darkest secrets uh... yeah we  can do that you want to know you want to wait we can do it now i guess yeah 
[32:30]
 well i a m c dot box show where they expose the magicians tricks and i was  the master of where exposing radio secrets  exposed  because there's a bunch of uh... jocks out there that are lazy  they don't do their own stuff  uh... they get things sent to him  like scripts and and cds with bits on them and then they just playing like  they're their own and make believe it's their stuff  one thing and then there are jocks that'll just play like old comedy cds and  yeah and that's as creative as they get anything to do and create radio so 
[33:00]
 that they do some kind of like you know funny five o'clock five o'clock like that  that's what a package stupid thing else let's play an old george carlin record  and they have on funny and and uh... creative and entertaining yeah well  regardless at least uh... there are a few people out there that that  just do  their own stuff  but you like to do that our own stuff we try  and uh... you know sometimes were successful and other times we fall on our  face we know that but we're not going to take a pre-packaged thing and say it's 
[33:30]
 you know our direct and terrible right at least we try  yeah we'll give it a world so that said uh... does a comedy service that's been  you know trying to get us to sign up with their little service  and i think this will not take no for an answer  first of all because this  uh... there's no humor involved in the stuff whatsoever terrible and this  comedy services in every city in america  and they prepackaged this stuff in the morning show plays it and it and will  make believe that it's their stuff yeah like they were up all night 
[34:00]
 writing this right according to it'll be like a fake commercial or fake song  yeah  and you sit there at home and some people find it funny and then on and  then they'll take the credit for it  all right well with that said uh...  i got the latest uh... offering from this comedy service now this is also a  lot of these things work they send you a cd  one half  of a little scripted bit recorded on the cd yeah and then there's gaps  in between  that guy's part  where the dj 
[34:30]
 is supposed to interact yes with the person so that it makes it sound more  real like they came right with it  because now it's the guy's voice oh my god that they must have done this  themselves yes  it is uh... a rules right a clever rules  so we want to try doing some of the material in the air show you how great it  is and how funny it is let's see how it works out there this is absolutely  historical stuff again  understand why we don't want to sign up with them tomorrow at the night  alright so this bitch called barney the red nose toady

[39:00]
 uh...  and they're right next to each other  and everyone was confused  as well and we were supposed to meet at uh... harry's  salaries  well we all know that we are aware that harry's  that where we you will be but we all stood out outside and we went over it as  a group and said are we supposed to be a salary is a very few people  idiots were all together let's just go right here  and we did and we did have a great time watched uh... all we got a lot of that 
[39:30]
 too  watch the couple pretty much have to wait out and get it on in the booth now  we're at mustang larry's right  mustang harry's harry's okay  and uh...  well stand by the bar having to have in some drinks  and we who looked over first  uh... was in there was a new market  i don't even know who was somebody just went and check that out  and i look at the booth and there's a guy and a girl in the boosters 
[40:00]
 going at it going out and the girls shirt was unbuttoned the guy's hand was  in our shirt  and her hand was on his crotch  and they would take  just draw  going at it and we kept like  like trying to look like you're not looking at first like the where where  uh... taking peaks around the pole and stuff is really one of you know  look like the losers it was so obvious though that everybody was looking to  spend people all around the bar  pretty much huddled around their table at first it was very uh... i was very 
[40:30]
 careful when they were taking their peaks and by the end of the night by an  hour later  did there was a scalper selling you know front row seats  this is all it's a mustang barriers or whatever  and i think that the carries  harry's  and uh... right so what happened to bed  well that's a that's it with that story  well you know we had a good idea that all but in that situation bars it was  fine it with the funny part was the couple had  they thought they were getting away with something like a man known as known as 
[41:00]
 that you know to pay attention to us and we have to uh...  grab my package for a little while  now we're all watching  night so bad you left the party and you didn't go to mustang uh... and harry's  you go  i had a return again  without your eyes man i was traumatizing experience i want to have  okay  we'd all been drinking at the christmas party as we know and  party night just decided i had the bright idea to go to uh... a large 
[41:30]
 nightclub  uh... that's known for you know strange activity  solely we arrived in the the nightclub there about uh... twelve thirty week  those these three women you know  address very well and dancing together and and you know going out and so so  speak my uh...  the friend decker approach them for dancing out with them and you know  filling out on these ladies hot  you know very well and i don't know if you think you're doing well by and  okay i think we're doing very well it is going really well we convinced them to 
[42:00]
 leave with us which i  well i have to have an hour to get out of you know that could go to the bar  do you want to have this is going  so i noticed when we go to the coat check that their voices weren't you know  that they had like guys voices  they had guy voices  but they're good looking women so  sure they are  uh...  i guess they had said something i i missed this 
[42:30]
 said something they said something to my my friend and i i wasn't pay attention  i wasn't standing right there and uh...  so i walked out of the  out of the tunnel there with with  you know to my arm and i was every guy's looking at him checking them out some  like i think this is pretty good so you think you're pretty much uh...  and i think that uh... supermodel or something and my friend but they had  mainly voices when you got there  all of the women's bodies so when then did you find out that they had a slot  uh...  right to the point here 
[43:00]
 uh... well we uh... we were at the top ahead in your children's door and we  uh... talking at the bar about how we had met i was with uh... one of them my  friend was off with the other one and she said  well that's great that you don't have any problem with uh...  trans sexuality  uh...  if you're not getting freaked out and i was totally freaked out at this moment  wait wait wait you can stop saying she now yeah  uh... he's not bald or anything you know  i asked her how i said well technology or he or whatever you want to call it i 
[43:30]
 said technology is pretty great because i would have never known she said well  party we would find out if we got an intimate site that uh...  so the only time so we can you know that she quit not  i realize what was going on you know i have a forty five minutes i say they're  making out the cab there was no time to get in the front of camp and on the way  hand on the leg not they were more touchy feeling  i got  well 
[44:00]
 leg and just  and  and  and  and so i mean you're up in your leg  and and what were you doing to get a shower together in the morning  something here and i know that  he whatever is rubbing your leg and at this point i still think it's a check 
[44:30]
 you are not going to just sit there you're going to respond right now i was  sitting where you touch her why were you talking to why were you touching the  hot girls are you talking about she's rubbing your leg and you're sitting there  doing this little notice i have to be this is not when the voice was started  freaking out and i noticed that they share a lot of makeup on under a little  but  but  but  but  but  but  this is the start of the specs on the 
[45:00]
 but  but  but you still let her rub your leg  well  but  but  but  are classic when i was on all fours i started to suspect something  man  i can't start that  well then  well  picture a catcher  uh...  i didn't have to come in here and tell them about it  notice it didn't sit down during the whole story 
[45:30]
 that  and they didn't have to  uh... just a little bit and that's great  uh... right  thanks for sharing with the so what do you think around  uh...  and then i must say i don't know  uh...  uh...  and over the other one  one of two seven w any doubt that you know i can do your 
[46:00]
 john for the day and the wall flowers before that so be an anthony for the  right home  getting a bunch of requests a anthony  yes for our two bits  one is you'll see the pork man  uh... the little christmas on the pork man did last week on our radio show  very haunting yes i'm sure will play that you haven't heard it yet you  definitely want to stick around for that  and uh... i'm proud to say that people are requesting the i stole stuff from  your hotel bit  and you play that very late  in the show  last week 
[46:30]
 so uh... this would be a good time to get it on okay yes  johnny land  me on the rock in new york one or two seven w any doubt that you know  on the way days in the pink floyd as well  and we're going to leave the show tonight with the gerbil song to getting a ton of  requests for that so i just want to make sure you get your tape player setting  ready to go so you get a copy of that concern  we listen to you guys when you send the email  yes we do have to just people starting to bootleg a lot of the the wacky  uh... little bits and stuff that we do we don't care 
[47:00]
 now we we appreciate that spread the word we can use all the help we can get  at least it's somebody up putting a tapes of us out there are record company  doesn't know it  now anthony be nice  well we keep getting calls from people going to guys where can i get your cd  and what we have to say  uh... we don't know  no we don't know and is it because we don't talk to our record company  no we speak to them probably weekly  and nothing ever happens and now that we're playing the grandma got run over  by a reindeer song from opi anthony's the man world now people really want to 
[47:30]
 see the entire for christmas and uh...  a record company gives the great news last week that they shipped another eighty  units  eighty-eight unit they actually call us to tell us this like it like this is  going to make us excited  eighty how many people can listen to any w on a weekly basis when you get  sent to me  all-time i couldn't even begin to think couple million different people yeah  okay  and i'm obviously not everyone into us  let's say small percent of say 
[48:00]
 maybe one percent of the people okay might be interested  in uh... purchasing an open Anthony the man world city maybe maybe it's in the  back of my like well you know if i saw that maybe i would buy it  alright so what's one percent to make two million  to counts  to two hundred thousand right  one percent of sound two thousand  to twenty thousand  twenty-two  to like i've ever regarded  what's one percent  to two million 
[48:30]
 twenty thousand twenty thousand  okay i was part of the look alright  for sake of argument twenty thousand people out there might be interested in  buying our cd picture he thought so why don't the record company ship  eighty units  eighty units open  and that's conservative numbers  i'm sure there's a lot more than twenty thousand people that would be interested  in picking up our cd in the new york area  farm at the right 
[49:00]
 oh my god i was great at man to a pathetic  i've got screwed up at the decimal point there  how many units could a record store i mean how many records are there  uh... on manhattan g campy that many of those right maybe two or three half a  one or something yeah pretty much is one city per ten record  stores well  i would that said  i'm not i've also made a lot of people money over the weekend  uh... and here doesn't like to be on the air 
[49:30]
 but the math question what is what is  what is one percent two million  uh...  twenty twenty thousand twenty thousand  and alright i i think it's  yet twenty thousand i think the phones were like crazy cuz  people have an opportunity all of us and say we're on the call up so  break is the policy of someone's got the right answer okay it is  uh... uh... yeah i i mean a lot of people uh... money  had to do that on friday i i was brave enough to go on the radio not many  people this town were brave enough to do this and i bet you a hundred bucks that

[57:00]
 telling us very low  and don't laugh over there  they get banned on you feel better  as my therapy you feel better for letting it out then uh...  well let's just say came out of the closet earlier not come out of the car  most people try to become members of the tuesday night farmer club on tuesdays  then has officially become part of the uh...  homosexual community  uh... now you're very in a minute earlier he came in and explained that 
[57:30]
 after the christmas party  on uh... friday night and then i must say you were pretty damn trashed  yeah i was yeah  he he went to this bar  and picked up these  hot chicks  and then for some reason when down to the village with them  and uh...  he found he found out that um...  jiminy cricket jeepers creepers they were men  they were  they were checked with nuts  the bank sexual and the best actual and the best line at uh... and it they weren't 
[58:00]
 a trend what were they transvestite and said for transsexuals sexual there they  don't know a lot of transvestites tell you that i have a good idea they had  boobs i mean they do now  big you know that's called breast implants and i mean it  the best line bank goes hey man  i knew i was doing great is like it i was hanging out the girls in the bar and  then we left the barn like everyone was staring at us they were staring at you  because you are the idiot that is the only with the man who had the bad the  men in dress they weren't staring at you because while look at that lucky guy 
[58:30]
 going home with that super model  uh... you're too trashed to realize that five o'clock shadows  and what you say earlier about the makeup  was a little bit of makeup on the you know i didn't realize that i don't know  i don't know what you say earlier then  what i say i don't remember what i want to pull the tape  you said there was a lot of makeup on the right now i was one of me but i didn't  realize that until we get into the other place with more like why do you think  so but a lot of makeup on the day knows  uh... 
[59:00]
 now uh...  you didn't have any makeup on you after the night was over did you know  and just wondering  i know that you said that the guy was rubbing your leg  at one point in the barn before you realize that it was a man and uh...  for forty five minutes for some reason i think  and  i know if a girl is rubbing my leg in a barn  for forty five minutes i'm gonna make a move  in that time 
[59:30]
 because you know you're in right  open my right of course you're right so now this guy is rubbing your leg you  think it's a check  and then  you don't do anything  i think you touched i think that i think that  uh...  writing  and  i know more  but i think that  all 
[60:00]
 some of the traumatized  i guess  you know i don't know how much of a band you should confess right now in our show  that you actually made out with a guy i did not make out there and then he makes  a good point with the uh...  one of the drink and i really like you  you know  girls like me don't make guys like you a lot  but soon  touch my leg  you're going to be  yet to get away when she was touched your legs and we have to do it 
[60:30]
 we're going to think we have this is a good i mean if you feel some stimulation  other  beyond it i'd probably could have been separate way  highlighted by a man and i do know  and i know that i was a man i was born so when the guy was rubbing your leg  right did you or did you not get excited i probably did  Now by leg, are you talking knee?  Or upper thigh?  There was some thigh action, right?  There was some thigh action.  And you sat there sitting on your hands? 
[61:00]
 What were your hands doing?  I had a Heineken in my hands.  Alright, there's one hand.  That was not a Heineken!  That was Bob!  That was no Heineken.  So you were sitting on your hands?  Yes.  Was it a long neck Heineken bottle?  For some reason the bottle kept getting a long neck and then back down to a stubby. 
[61:30]
 So when...  I'm never going to live this town.  No, you're not.  You're absolutely right.  You're never, ever going to live this town.  Ben was so excited about this story.  He called me three times this weekend to tell me.  It's a great story.  It is a great story.  I mean, I just never thought...  It's tragic.  It's tragic.  A cute little story.  It could have been a lot worse.  So when did this...  We know it was worse, but you're not going to confess to it.  It was a little worse.  So when did this girl break the news to you that she was a guy? 
[62:00]
 Was it when you guys were both taking a leak in the bathroom?  As she was standing next to me at the urinal, I got a little suspicious.  I really like you, Ben.  You want to zip this up for me?  Come on, confess more.  What do you want to know?  I just know that more than you say.  Now you have the Heineken in one hand, right?  Now your other hand.  You're close enough where he's got his hand on your leg. 
[62:30]
 Now what's your other hand doing?  You weren't...  It was on the table.  You didn't like maybe touch the shoulder a little and go,  wow, you're like a linebacker.  You didn't touch the shoulder and, you know...  Nothing?  No contact.  You had no contact.  In 45 minutes thinking this was a girl with her hand on your leg,  you didn't even touch her.  The most contact I had was when we walked out.  I told you I had two of them on each arm.  That was really...  You told me you hugged a couple.  I did.  I hugged one of them.

 I hugged the one with the huge fake boobs in front of the bank machine.  I hugged...  This was before...  A little peck on the cheek maybe?  No.  When they went to kiss me when they left,  I realized they're a guy.  I put my head down so they got my hair and they're like,  you're not going to let us kiss you?  I was like, no way.  He was a homo sandwich.  I am far from a homo.  Oh, man.  I came close this weekend, but...  You better get those glasses checked, man.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  How much were you drinking that night?  That you would leave with two men. 
[63:30]
 Not even one guy.  Three.  He left with three guys.  You left with three guys.  It was myself and my friend Decker.  At the time, I thought there were three girls.  Do you realize if they wanted to assault you,  one would have to sit and wait while the other two finished?  Listen, I came back on it.  You were in that much trouble where all three of them couldn't even do it at the same time.  One would have to sit back and wait. 
[64:00]
 Three men.  Start slow.  You know, what are you doing?  You don't enter the gay community with three guys.  You're going to kill yourself.  Wow.  Most guys start dating.  They start off slow.  I'm going full out.  I want three men. 
[64:30]
 And you know something?  There's that one in a million tranny that you look at and go,  right, he's pulling it off.  Kind of looks like a chick.  But when you have three in the same bar,  one is going to look like Murray.  You know, a bomb.  And you said that they had the deep voices and stuff.  You didn't notice that?  I had suspicions.  I definitely had suspicions. 
[65:00]
 Jesus.  It's been curious.  I've been curious.  I've switched.  It's been over.  I'm switching stations now.  Yeah, go over to Q.  Perfect company over there.  Yeah, you'll fit right in.  Alright, very good.  Once again, Ben.  Thank you, Ben.  Once again, you haven't proven anything.  I know.  I still think a lot more happened on that bar stool or table 
[65:30]
 when he's touching your leg and you do nothing.  I can't accept that.  I told you I hugged the other one.  That's true.  From the bank machine with the big boobs.  You're the guy, okay.  I didn't have huge boobs.  How is he poking me in the stomach when I see both of his hands?  We asked him that question.  He said, where is it?  Because there was no balls.  You were still hanging out after you figured it out?  I was fast.  Not enough.  That was when I watched the other guy. 
[66:00]
 You heard what my friend Decker said when he called in.  He said, I came over and looked way to close and said I had to get out of here.  I freaked out when I figured out what was going on.  You hung out?  At that point, Ben, you just cut your losses.  Cut your losses.  He wanted to know where his penis was.  He was fascinated with all this stuff.  Fascinating.  Where did he tell you it was, Ben?  He never answered that question. 
[66:30]
 Where it was isn't important.  Where it could be is.  It could have been a lot worse.  Where are you going tonight?  Cruising the glory hall?  Where are you going?  Therapy?  I'll be hanging out at the mine shaft tonight.  Then I'm going to pile drivers.  Come on, wait a second.  Everybody thinks I'm a homo.  We understand you're just a confused young man.  I'm a little taken aback that after it was learned that they were guys, 
[67:00]
 that you still hung out and kissed them.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  One from tracks, Bruce Springsteen, leaving train.  Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band touring in 1999.  We're all just patiently waiting for ticket info on that.  I saw the Bruce legends on VH1.  How was that? I haven't seen that yet.  Pretty good. I like that legends thing.  Even if they play artists that you don't like, 
[67:30]
 you end up kind of liking them.  It's like, oh, I kind of like the new kids on the block.  That was really good.  I feel like I know them now.  This weekend I saw Queen, U2, and Springsteen.  It was pretty good. Insightful.  Now you're not a U2 fan, so how did you like that one?  I thought it was great.  I thought it was pretty cool how they started out.  Punk kids and everything.  And kept it together. 
[68:00]
 I got to respect them for that.  Changed the music a little bit at the end of the 80s.  Able to pull that off.  I have a newfound respect for them.  They didn't even know how to play their instruments at first.  They were really not that good at playing.  They wanted to do cover tunes when they first got together,  but they were so bad they didn't know how to play other people's songs.  So they just made up their own.  It was pretty cool. I enjoyed it.  Evil Can Evil last night.  In between the Jets and Dolphins game, I had to switch back and forth.  I didn't know what to do for a while there. 
[68:30]
 What did they have?  Celebrity Profile?  All these shows are the same, but they have different names.  Behind the music, Celebrity Profile.  Legends.  I don't know, whatever.  It was on Evil Can Evil and it was just so cool.  Evil. A fixture of the 70s.  He's dying, you know.  He needs a liver transplant.  He's got hepatitis C, which is the worst form of hepatitis.  He's going to die.  Which is kind of a bummer, you know.  I remember when I was a kid, always watching him.  He survived all those crashes and now look, 
[69:00]
 he's going out because he can't get a liver in time.  My favorite was the rocket.  No, it wasn't a rocket.  It was a sky cycle.  What?  It was a rocket. What do you mean?  No, man. It was the Evil Can Evil sky cycle.  Sky cycle?  That's what it was.  That's what he called it.  It was a rocket.  No, it was a sky cycle.  Were there wheels on it?  Well, no. 
[69:30]
 He called it the sky cycle.  I had a sky cycle when I was growing up.  My parents had to get me one because of the Snake River Canyon jump.  How did they explain how the shoot came out?  Well, there was a book written  a few years back by his  ex-marketing director  or publicist.  He claims that Evil  knew he was in an S-load of trouble  and decided that the only way to survive that  was to just pull the shoot immediately.  Yeah, that's what I figured.  That's the rumor  that Evil actually pushed the switch. 
[70:00]
 He ended up splattered in the middle of the canyon  if he didn't do that.  But no, it was interesting. I never saw this before.  I'm a big fan of Evil Can Evil.  Back in, I think it was 1965  when he was just a regular stunt man  like everyone else and he would go around the country  and do some of these stunts. One of his famous stunts  is he stands on a race track  and allows motorcycles and cars  to race at him.  They're going about 50 miles an hour  and he would jump up in the air just in time  and the bike or the car would go under him  before he landed down. 
[70:30]
 So he's not on a motorcycle or anything?  No, this was one of his earlier stunts before he became  the Evil Can Evil.  This was in the late 60s, mid-60s, whatever.  They showed footage of Evil  taking a handlebar to the groin  because he miscalculated  the jump.  He was 15 feet up in the air, flipping all over the place  and landing on his back.  Now he needed a liver?  From what? How did he get it?  Well, they said  because of all the operations and the blood transfusion.  But he could 
[71:00]
 need the liver from all the whiskey he drank.  The Terenka is a sauced up guy all the time.  But if you get the chance,  watch the celebrity profile in Evil Can Evil.  It's amazing.  It was so freaking cool.  The guy defied death so many damn times.  I just love all those shows  because you could learn more about anybody  than you ever could in history.  Flipping through the channels.  Another show on Hitler on the History Channel.  I like A&E Biographies, one of my favorite shows.  I'll even watch A&E Biography  on Kathie Lee Gifford 
[71:30]
 just because I hate her  and she's just useless to me.  But I don't know, they make it interesting.  That biography show is pretty damn cool.  We told everyone we'd leave with the Jets.  We're going to be back.  Alright, we told everyone we'd leave with the Gerbil song here.  Okay.  But hey, thanks for listening. We really appreciate the support.  We know you're out there.  Yes, thank you.  We're going to start cuddling our faithful listeners.  We need your help, you know? </pre>
