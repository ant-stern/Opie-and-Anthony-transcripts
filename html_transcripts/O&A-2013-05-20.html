<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between celebrity news, personal anecdotes, listener calls, and comedic bits.  The show began with a discussion of the *Celebrity Apprentice* finale, focusing on Penn Jillette's perceived unfair loss to Trace Adkins.  The hosts dissected Trump's allegedly biased judging, suggesting it stemmed from a personal grudge related to comments Jillette made about Trump's hair in his book.  They detailed Adkins' past, including being shot by his ex-wife and his decision not to press charges, and recounted a fight between Omarosa and LaToya Jackson during the finale.  This transitioned into a critique of Justin Bieber's attempt at a "hardcore" image, contrasted with Bruno Mars' successful stage presence, and an analysis of a video clip of Miguel injuring an audience member during his performance. Sam Roberts was mentioned in relation to upcoming podcast content. The "Opie and Anthony Nugget," possibly featuring the George Brett story, was also discussed.

The show then moved to a more loosely connected set of topics.  It started with criticism of a musician's rapidly changing image, followed by a strongly negative discussion of Bette Midler, fueled by an anecdote about her alleged refusal to take a picture with a female military veteran and her political stances. This segued into a discussion of *Jersey Boys*, the Four Seasons, Frankie Valli, and a previous disagreement with Barry Williams, which the hosts intended to apologize for. The segment continued with anecdotes about a text exchange with a cleaning lady whose broken English caused humorous misunderstandings; the hosts’ Candy Crush addiction and their attempts to manipulate the game's mechanics; and a story about a stand-up performance encounter with a masseuse who had cerebral palsy. The segment concluded with a clip of a poorly sung rendition of the "Star Spangled Banner," a discussion of a previous incident involving a newscaster, and an attempt at a dead air challenge.

The next segment began with a vulgar discussion of women's beach attire, followed by Jim Brewer's story about a chaotic encounter with Lars involving a knapsack hitting a woman. This was followed by a graphic, sexually explicit monologue.  The show then shifted to a discussion of "creepy kids," featuring numerous listener calls detailing unsettling stories of children referencing dead relatives or unseen entities.  Callers shared anecdotes about children reacting to unseen figures, and making statements about deceased relatives or strange occurrences. Speculation ranged from children's imaginations to possible paranormal activity. The segment concluded with more listener calls, a discussion of Stone Temple Pilots' new singer (Chester Bennington), and a conversation with Jesse Joyce in studio, which included graphic and humorous anecdotes about strip clubs.

Jesse Joyce's guest appearance dominated the following segment.  He shared several anecdotes, including accidentally revealing a comedian's planned proposal on stage; an Alaskan stripper's involvement in murders; speculation on a Powerball lottery winner; Curt Schilling's financial ruin; Jesse's own investment failures (including Citadel Broadcasting's IPO, a supposed breast cancer cure, and "Melba Water"); his struggles with alcohol and gambling, including a DUI arrest and a humorous DUI class experience; and a disastrous comedy introduction where the MC took a joke about Holocaust denial literally.

The final segment revisited the *Celebrity Apprentice* finale, focusing again on the alleged rigging in favor of Trace Adkins.  The hosts discussed Trump's use of a year-and-a-half-old apology letter from Jillette to influence the competition.  A significant portion focused on listener calls about their Candy Crush addiction, including strategies for overcoming challenging levels,  the frustration caused by hints, and the financial implications of purchasing in-game items (one caller mentioned spending $300 on Marvel Avengers Alliance). Opie’s role in introducing the game to the host and his subsequent addiction were heavily discussed, along with the impact on his personal life. The segment briefly mentioned an abandoned plan for a stalker's wedding to Patty Fezz and a professional wrestling event.  Nicole from the *Morning Mashup* briefly joined the show, sharing her own Candy Crush experiences.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, this is perfect.  This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me!  I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on?  Life?  No, is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  I'm telling you what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. 
[00:04:00]  It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why this is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And Sam.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:30]  Good morning.  Morning, morning, morning.  Hi, everyone.  There we are.  Yes.  All ready to broadcast.  We are broadcasting.  What?  We are.  How did that happen?  We are actually broadcasting right now.  Why didn't anyone tell me we're on the air?  Here we go.  Last we left you.  What happened on Friday?  That was like three days ago already.  Friday? 
[00:05:00]  Dennis Rodman looks like an asshole.  Well, yeah.  I didn't get to watch.  I was watching the Billboard Music Awards instead of Celebrity Apprentice.  The Taylor Swift Show?  The Taylor Swift Show?  Yeah.  With a little Justin Bieber thrown in.  Bieber's not getting any love, I guess, huh?  And Madonna trying to look young.  Who?  Madonna.  Who?  Madonna.  Jesus.  She went pantsless.  What?  She had this getup, but they're saying she didn't really have any pants on.  She didn't look bad, actually. 
[00:05:30]  She didn't look bad.  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  She's never been my thing, but she didn't look bad.  No.  That face work is starting to look all right.  Really?  She getting the hang of it?  I think so.  I think it loosened up a little bit because when she first got whatever it was, cheek implants  or something, she looked downright creepy, but she doesn't look as bad anymore.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Friday was what?  Trace Atkins Day?  Yeah.  Our boy, Trace Atkins.  It was a big show with Trace. 
[00:06:00]  And he won Celebrity Apprentice?  Yes, he did.  Well, he deserved it, man.  We were behind him all the way.  His ice cream sucked, by the way.  No one could say it in front of him.  Not a fan of the maple macadamia ice cream.  It wasn't as good as Penn's ice cream?  Oh, God.  It wasn't even close.  Penn's ice cream was so good.  He wound up selling more ice cream.  Penn wound up selling more ice cream.  Yeah.  In the Trace.  Yeah.  But he did not win. 
[00:06:30]  But that's not fair.  Well.  It just shows you it's a dumb goof show.  Business isn't fair.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  I ate so much of that goddamn ice cream.  I'm done with this.  Yeah?  Yeah, I went through two pints.  No problem.  Wow, you did.  You got more?  No, fuck yeah, I got more.  That shit was really good.  It was righteous.  And wherever I went, you couldn't really find the Penn Jillette ice cream.  Yeah, huh?  I mean, I found it, but there wasn't many pints laying around. 
[00:07:00]  And then what?  The place was loaded up with the Trace Atkins fucking waffle syrup ice cream?  Yeah.  It was a little...  Yeah.  Yeah, if I want that much maple, you know, I'll have pancakes.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We love Penn Jillette, but man, that Trace Atkins, within two days, turned us all around.  He was very fun.  He was a great guest.  I'm sure he was.  He was a great guest.  And, you know, he talked about whatever. 
[00:07:30]  I was scared to ask him half the shit.  Wow.  Did you look at his finger?  Oh, yeah.  He showed it.  Yeah, it's all fucked up.  He showed it.  He's like, yeah, it's bent.  It's bent at like a 90 degree angle.  Completely bent.  Pinky.  And he can't move it.  Did it on purpose so he could play.  I was thinking, though, that's a real man.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  God forbid I lost my finger.  I would have him reattach it so it looks like normal.  Yeah, yeah.  But to him, he's like, fuck that.  You know, have it all bent and shit so I can hold on to a guitar string a little bit with it. 
[00:08:00]  Play the guitar.  Yeah, man.  Can he move it at all?  No.  It's a dead finger.  It just hangs there.  It's just fused at a 90 degree angle.  Yeah.  So he can sustain.  Sus.  Sus.  So he could sus.  Sus.  Finger.  Yeah, he's all man, that guy.  Fucking oil rigs and accidents and fucking near-death experiences.  Shot by his ex-wife.  Fucking crazy.  I guess his new wife was yelling and screaming that the ex-wife did not call 911. 
[00:08:30]  No, she was like in the sound booth yelling, fuck her.  She called her fucking lawyer first.  Because Trace Atkins is such a good dude.  He's like, he said he went into the bathroom because he didn't want to bleed on this really nice rug, I think he said.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice carpet.  So he laid down in his bathroom waiting to die.  Yeah.  And he said the chick that shot him called 911.  And then his current wife was yelling and screaming, that's not true.  She called her goddamn lawyer. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  So who called 911?  I don't know.  Maybe the lawyer did.  No, I mean, he said she did.  She must have, but she didn't call 911 first, I guess.  Right.  I don't know.  That's kind of what I got out of it.  I don't know.  And he didn't press charges, which we were confused with, but then he told us that it made the divorce nice and clean.  Hmm.  So he saved a lot of money by not...  By not pressing charges.  That was one of those things like, okay, look, you fucking shot me through my goddamn heart and lungs.  Let's just fucking bow out of this little relationship and keep my shit. 
[00:09:30]  I'll give you a little pocket money, but you're not getting any of my goddamn houses.  Not getting that fucking Trace music money.  Now, why did she shoot him?  I don't know.  Did she ever give a reason, or did he give a reason as to why she shot him?  We were too scared to ask him.  He said he wasn't being a good man.  Right.  He kept it vague.  I don't think he deserved to be shot.  Are you cheating?  He kind of drifted in that general.  Well, she was pointing the gun at him, and what did he say? 
[00:10:00]  Give me that gun, or I'm going to take it from you and beat you with it or something?  Yeah, yeah.  So she decided to put it under his armpit and pull the trigger.  Wow.  That's just crazy.  I'm going to take it and beat you with it.  Why would you say that to somebody who has a gun?  Because he handled it.  The fucking Gunnery Sergeant Hartman fucking way to handle somebody with a weapon.  Because he's a man's man.  That's why.  Yeah.  His stories were all just man.  Just all manly stories. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  He got pulled over with a loaded pistol one time.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The stories this guy was telling, it was just unbelievable.  Mm-hmm.  He'll probably be part of the podcast this week, right, Sam Roberts?  Yeah, I would think that that whole thing with him and Guy Fieri and Colin Quinn and Tom  Papa and just weirdness and hilarity.  It was fun.  The guy was all rock and roll.  Rocking and rolling. 
[00:11:00]  What did his t-shirt say?  He had an ACDC shirt on for those about to rock.  That's what he does.  That's how he came in.  Yeah.  Right after we were making fun of how he's all rock and roll, that's how he showed up.  But, very good news, he's going to cater the bus trip.  Oh, good.  Which supposedly is happening in September.  Good.  No, it is good.  I know.  He's going to set up barbecues all over the fucking place.  It's just something so white trashy about we're having a bus trip catered by a guy who does  Jack Daniel's chicken.  But he knows all the joints. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  So he's going to map it out for us.  I think that's great.  I hope it happens.  I'll believe it when it happens.  Yeah, so why?  Supposedly it's going to happen in September now.  They actually asked if a certain week is good for everybody, right?  Yeah.  Mid-September, somewhere around there.  I don't know.  What about Montreal?  Are we going to Montreal for the festival?  Oh, I don't know.  That's, that's, I don't know.  It's in the works.  That's in the works.  It's in the works.  Oh, okay.  It's on the back burner.  By the way, the new podcast will be what?  Available Wednesday morning? 
[00:12:00]  Wednesday morning.  Because people are like, hey, the first one was really good, but what?  That's it?  What are you doing?  I actually got that tweet last night.  That's it?  It's been a couple days.  We're only doing one a week.  That's what you do.  I mean, if we weren't doing this full time, then maybe we'd have a whole bunch of podcasts  up, but we can't.  Yeah.  We can only do like one podcast a week.  It's a weekly thing.  Just a little taste.  And it's mostly to, you know, hopefully get people to listen to this show.  On board.  Get them on board.  On a more regular basis.  Or get new listeners. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  But thanks for everybody that's subscribing to the podcast.  I hear it's doing really, really well.  It is doing very well.  Very good.  People are, you do four hours a day, five days a week.  Hey, hey, what are you doing?  What?  It's only worse stuff?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking people.  Yeah, it is.  Yes.  It's only that yes.  But it's people complaining that get to hear this show.  So then they go to the podcast and then they see that it's very similar to this show and 
[00:13:00]  they're all bummed out.  I guess it's flattering.  Yeah, it is flattering.  You just don't imagine people have that kind of time on their hands.  But I mean, it's, you know, we're going to dip into the archives and pull some old  stuff out too.  Oh, yeah.  And of course, the Opie and Anthony Nugget.  Is there a lot of buzz about the Opie and Anthony Nugget?  Oh, yeah.  And the Nugget.  Oh, yeah.  What's on the short list of possibilities for the Opie and Anthony Nugget?  This week.  I suggested the Mike Schmidt shit story.  Right.  That was that was George Brett or Mike Schmidt? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, George, George Brett.  Sorry.  The George Brett story is right now the leading contender.  There's still more E-Rock songs to go, obviously.  Some you got to spread those out, though.  As much as I love a good E-Rock song.  Yeah.  Lots of options for Nuggets.  Colin sure enjoyed the E-Rock song.  God, he really did.  Oh, boy.  He was laughing.  Just when E-Rock thought it was going to go away.  Colin really fucking sold it. 
[00:14:00]  Couldn't get enough.  Sean F.  I'm an asshole.  Sean F. is very excited because he got 10,000 clicks on that song because of Colin Quinn.  It's worth more.  Yep.  But anyway, so Trace Atkins turned us all around.  We were all big Pendulet fans, and we are still.  But we knew there was not even a chance that Pendulet could win after learning about Trace  Atkins and having him on the show.  And the Donald knew that.  Right.  You know, they got to make the winner.  They got to, you know, popular with the people. 
[00:14:30]  But I don't get it if Pendulet sold a lot more ice cream.  Well, you know, that Midwest crowd.  But that was the whole, that was the whole.  You'd think if you were the most successful businessman there.  It's a business show.  Right.  And you're a, quote, business.  Your ice cream sold way more than the other guy.  It should be a no-brainer.  How much more did it sell?  A hell of a lot more.  Yeah, but maples sucked.  I don't know the numbers, but.  And the people weren't voting. 
[00:15:00]  It was all up to Donald Trump.  You know, the guy with the business mind.  Of course.  So what was his logic in the whole thing?  Well, he said, it was very telling.  The thing that he said right before he fired Penn.  Mm-hmm.  Was the, wait, technically, no.  Because it's the finale.  So he doesn't fire.  He hires.  Oh.  You're hired.  Right.  Wait, so when he gets this huge live audience, he doesn't use his catchphrase?  He hasn't in the past.  He just says, you're hired.  You're hired.  You're hired. 
[00:15:30]  Wait.  You're hired.  Oh, my God.  You see.  I usually say you're fired, but I'm saying you're hired.  That daughter of his is fucking pretty hot, though.  Oh, God, she is.  That Ivanka.  Ivanka.  She married?  Ivanka, yeah.  Yeah, she is.  Oh, she's already married.  Fucking, what, spit a kid out.  Those Trumps love having kids, don't they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They sure do.  She's very attractive.  But right before he announced the winner of Celebrity Apprentice, he mentioned that 
[00:16:00]  in Penn's book, I guess, after the last season of Apprentice, that Penn had taken some shots  at him.  Yeah, so.  So now it's like.  So what?  He's holding a personal grudge?  That's the only thing.  A year later or a couple years later at this point?  They went through the two-hour show.  Right.  And then at the very end, he says, you know, you did say some nasty things.  So it was just a revenge thing.  Like, hey, after all is said and done.  Right.  All the contestants, all of the, everything that happened on the show.  I'm still pissed that you fucking bad-mouthed my hair. 
[00:16:30]  So you're fired.  So they should have fired him, you know, weeks ago.  Yeah.  He said in his book that Donald Trump's hair, he said, he did say to his credit, he said,  Donald Trump has better hair than me, but it looks like cotton candy made of piss.  Oh, well, yeah.  Wait, Pendulet said that Donald Trump has better hair than him?  Pendulet said.  That's just a lie.  Well, he's being, you know.  He's being polite.  Yeah, but you could, I hate that be polite shit so you can do your line. 
[00:17:00]  But that makes it hurt more.  When you lift him up a little bit and then you lift him a little higher just so you can knock  him down farther.  I guess.  Can we see the finale?  Well, what part?  And the moment where Donald Trump said, you're hired.  The music.  You want to see the very end?  You want to see the big Omarosa-Latoya Jackson fight?  Oh, look out.  Yeah, what was that about?  Look out.  Well, Latoya Jackson said that, she inferred that, you know, Omarosa was seeing, what's  his name before, when he died?  Michael Clark Duncan.  Michael Clark Duncan. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, they were in here together.  Right.  And right after Latoya got fired in her limo as she was driving away, she inferred that  Michael Clark Duncan's heart attack was probably caused by taking Omarosa.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  So, what, they haven't seen each other since?  No, and I guess Omarosa's suing her.  Oh, so it's a, it's, wow.  She was very pissed.  Suing her why?  Like, for implying that?  Uh, yeah, I think it's more of a, like, I don't think she can actually win a lawsuit.  Of course she can't. 
[00:18:00]  No.  And then they got into an argument that Gary Busey had to try to break off.  What kind of fucking freak show?  And Dennis Rodman is just sitting behind them in a Hawaiian patterned blazer and a big fake  yellow mohawk.  And makeup.  And makeup?  No, his eye shadow and stuff and lipstick.  Yeah, his dumb fucking, Donald Trump can't hire a guy like that.  No, of course not.  He said, Stephen Baldwin's just over here in his suit taking himself seriously.  What did she say to Omarosa?  Wait, why is Stephen Baldwin taking himself so seriously? 
[00:18:30]  He's an idiot.  They're all morons.  He's a goofball, too.  They are all morons.  Pendulet is the only one that, well, Dee Schneider, I'll put in that category, too.  Dee Schneider's back there like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here again.  Him and Pendulet deserve better.  Does he do well on those, Dee?  Yeah.  He has.  He didn't do well on this one.  He got fired early this year, right?  Yeah.  Who else deserves better from that show?  Because there's a lot of goofballs there.  Well, Trace.  Yeah, Trace deserves better. 
[00:19:00]  Pendulet deserves better.  Not Stephen Baldwin.  Dee Schneider.  Maybe Mary Lou Henner?  No.  She's a goofball now.  Yeah, she was good.  She's got a very good memory.  All right, let's see the fight.  Okay.  So, you know, Omarosa, I've always wanted to ask you this.  Is that just for the camera, or are you being serious?  I'm all about making good TV, and we've done that for 10 years and 13 seasons.  I agree with you.  We have done that.  It certainly was exciting.  So, LaToya, Omarosa, let me just ask you. 
[00:19:30]  Are you back?  Are you friends again, LaToya?  We were never friends, and I don't think we'll ever be friends.  Could you be friends?  You see in the middle of the way.  You see.  You see.  You see between them.  Oh, look out.  Could you be friends with Omarosa?  And for the record, I never once said anything negative about Michael Duncan Clark.  He's a wonderful.  Michael Duncan Clark.  No.  That's the thing you can say about LaToya, who passed away.  First of all, you're not LaToya.  Thank you, Gary.  Thank you.  All right.  I said.  Okay, in other words, Penn. 
[00:20:00]  In other words, definitely.  Oh, you said something about Michael Jackson there.  Easy, easy, easy.  Okay.  Who needs you two guys?  Who needs you?  He's a fan of Joe.  Okay, good.  So you're getting along beautifully now.  That's good.  That's the way I like it.  Peace.  Peace.  All right.  Does he always do it in front of a live audience?  Just for the finale.  The big finale.  The big finale is in front of a live audience.  God, why wouldn't you let those two just go at it?  And they completely choreographed the fact that they set Gary Busey between the two women 
[00:20:30]  that are fighting.  Yeah, yeah.  That was totally fucking calculated.  I was so distracted by that commercial.  So it looks like a cartoon version of me and Opie in the rockauto.com.  Oh, it was an animation.  Of course, it's like, wow, it looks like Opie and Anthony cartoons.  Jesus Christ.  Very funny.  Yeah.  I can't get enough of the Tony Saragossa commercial, by the way.  Hey, Tony Saragossa here.  You pissing your pants?  Trying to sell it. 
[00:21:00]  Trying to sell it.  That it's a manly thing to wear a fucking ditey.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Just throw your underwear away.  Just buy new ones.  All right.  Let's go to the big announcement.  I want to see the logic in this whole fucking decision.  Maybe you should play the clip.  I don't know if this...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  I could do that.  Omarosa.  What did she say about Michael Jackson?  I heard that.  Your brother, she said.  Your brother died.  Your brother died.  You should have more respect. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, did she?  She's just trying to mention...  She should have said something.  Like, you know, you should have gone over there and maybe, what, you can't sing him a lullaby?  Have him go to sleep?  What's the matter, huh?  You have something.  Yeah.  Bring up the kid thing.  Yeah.  Why do you need fucking drugs and fucking children running around?  Huh?  Yeah.  That would have been a good one.  Omarosa was in here.  She couldn't have been nicer and more quiet.  Yep.  She was so chill.  All smiles.  She was really in love with him.  She's the...  Michael Clark Duncan.  ...reality show staple, you know, the angry woman.  Yeah, but we were all surprised when that... 
[00:22:00]  We didn't realize who it was at first.  Yeah.  Because we were expecting some over-the-top bitch.  Yeah.  She says she doesn't act that way unless she's getting paid to be on a reality show.  Ah, there you go.  She's trying to change her image a little bit.  I get it.  She's just trying to make that money.  It's like, look out.  She's a bitch.  Oh, look out.  All right, here's the finale of Celebrity Apprentice.  So, Penn, you said some really bad things about me the last time when you got fired.  And you were nice enough to write a letter, but you attacked me in a lot of ways. 
[00:22:30]  You even attacked my hair, but you did say it was real.  In a funny way, yeah.  Okay.  Do you regret that?  Yes.  No, I don't regret telling the truth, but my mind has changed.  I did not know when I was first on the show that it was honest.  I thought this was a second chance.  And I think you can say that since the second season started, I have been polite, energetic,  and nothing but pro the show.  And my team won.  More and more of my ideas were used, and I enjoyed every second of it.  And the letter you wrote me was from the heart. 
[00:23:00]  Completely sincere.  Okay, and I accept that.  That's good you've done for Opportunity Village.  And also, Penn and Teller are like 30% up for a number of years.  That's pretty good.  You're doing great.  Trace, what are your final thoughts?  My final thoughts are that going into this last task.  He starts grilling Penn about insulting him.  Yes.  And then he just goes, hey, Trace, final thoughts?  Yeah.  And he's grilling Penn on something that happened years ago.  Yeah.  That they moved past from.  Not only is it not the final task, it's nothing from this season of the show.  Nothing. 
[00:23:30]  He's been holding the grudge the entire time.  Of course he has.  How many years ago did that happen?  It was probably a year or two ago.  Yeah.  It was in Penn Jillette's book.  It was very funny.  The chapter on Celebrity Apprentice was very funny.  He's just sitting there making Penn Jillette like,  all right, I'm going to bring this guy to the finals,  and then I'm going to fire him because he's an asshole.  And he's going to make him fucking almost apologize again.  Right.  And by the way, he did right before this,  because he could have, the whole deal is like,  if you win $100,000, it goes to your charity. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And he could have given them both $100,000  because right before he did this,  he brought out Little John, who was in third place.  Mm-hmm.  And he goes, hey, Little John,  I'm going to give $100,000 to your charity.  Wow.  Because I like you.  Mm-hmm.  And nothing for Penn Jillette?  No.  Hey, what the fuck is that about?  Oh, he's just fucking Penn over.  He brought him back just to fuck him.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  He's just an asshole.  Yeah.  My final thoughts are that going into this last task, 
[00:24:30]  I think I delivered the best ice cream,  I made the best commercial,  I put on the best show,  I brought in the biggest celebrities,  and I raised the most money.  That's exactly what I was going to say.  Okay.  And I know that the American Red Cross  is very near and dear to your heart.  There's somebody,  there's a Red Cross volunteer right this second  helping somebody in this country.  Helping somebody.  Look at how nice that is compared to  do you feel bad about calling my hair piss color?  Yeah, you know,  he set Penn up for a big fall here. 
[00:25:00]  This has nothing to do with the show.  He did it on purpose.  This is a personal vendetta  that he brought Penn back just for the,  Penn never had a chance.  So,  never had a chance.  He signed Penn to do the show  with the intention  of bringing him to the finals.  Right, to the finals.  To humiliate him.  He knew.  He knew right from the start  Penn was going to go all the way  because it's his choice.  Right.  You're fired, you're fired, you're fired.  Never going to be Penn  until the final episode  where he gets to humiliate him  on national television. 
[00:25:30]  And that's all his purpose was.  And whoever comes in third place,  he's also going to get money.  He's also going to get something.  But not Penn.  Not Penn.  Who sold the most ice cream.  Right.  Penn got so fucked on this.  Penn walked into a trap.  Yes, he did.  He really is an alpha male, Trump.  We got to give him credit.  Like, he alpha males guys  kind of like Penn.  Gene Simmons.  Gene is a fucking,  is a pretty dominant guy.  And man,  Trump really has a fucking way.  Yeah,  he's just got a way  with these other guys.  He just doesn't let  other guys intimidate him. 
[00:26:00]  He doesn't let a grudge go.  My God.  No, he really doesn't.  Vote great.  I mean,  there's no question about it.  No doubt about that.  Do you want to hear  who the winner is?  Oh,  sure.  So,  the winner  of all-star celebrity apprentice  is  the very great  The drama.  Trace Adkins.  Oh, 
[00:26:30]  oh,  Penn.  Penn,  you never had a chance.  Oh, God.  Penn knew that was going to happen.  At that moment,  he had to know.  Because the final,  the finale of this show is,  Penn,  tell me about the time  you said I had piss hair.  Trace,  tell me about how great you are.  Red cross,  helping people.  Right.  Yes.  You know what Penn was right there?  Remember the little movie  called Carrie?  Bring him up on stage  and pour the fucking blood  over his head.  Yeah.  That's exactly what Penn had.  He had the blood poured  all over his head.  That had nothing to do 
[00:27:00]  for his big moment.  In that moment,  Penn knew,  oh,  why did I do this?  Why did I fucking do this?  Why did I do this?  No,  not really.  Penn doesn't care.  I came here  to fucking be humiliated  by the guy  that was pissed off at me.  That's all.  Oh,  we picked the winner.  Penn could have sat  and done nothing  the whole season  and he would have made it  to the finale  because the sole purpose  was for Donald Trump  to make him look  like an asshole.  Yeah,  it was.  Like a fool. 
[00:27:30]  Like a fool.  He did.  He sold more ice cream.  He's a great idea guy.  Nothing against Trace Adkins.  But Penn,  you know,  he's a mover and a shaker,  that guy.  Donald knew.  He goes,  okay,  Penn apologized  for what he said  in his book  but he did it  in a letter  that he wrote to me.  I need to get him,  not just on my show,  on the finale of my show.  I gotta do this live.  The biggest ratings.  And pull his pants down  and dick him in the ass  in front of everybody.  Make him announce 
[00:28:00]  to the world  how great I am.  Right.  Because he wants me  not to fire him.  Bring up the fact  that he wrote  a fucking letter  of apology  that no one knew about  until the finale.  Yes.  What do you say  in the book exactly?  Is it online?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh,  poor Penn.  A victim.  I feel bad.  He was a victim  last night.  I thought Trace  would win the thing,  but...  Yeah,  but not because  of those reasons.  But,  I mean,  you don't humiliate  the other guy  for old shit  that he got passed.  Didn't talk about 
[00:28:30]  his charity,  nothing.  Nothing.  Yeah,  he didn't even mention  his charity.  Jesus.  And the Red Cross  is a great charity.  Yeah,  yeah.  Right now,  somebody in the Red Cross  is helping somebody.  He's just the perfect guy.  Perfect.  It's like a flag  fucking voice box.  He is a good guy.  He is America.  Everybody who does  these media tours  says that this is  the most difficult  thing they've ever done,  Celebrity Apprentice.  So,  in his book,  Penn wrote,  the secret truth 
[00:29:00]  of the Celebrity Apprentice  is that it isn't  very hard.  The tasks are nothing.  Makeup starts  just after 5 a.m.,  and the show goes  to about 10 p.m.,  but you spend  most of that time  doing nothing.  The Celebrity Apprentice  is junior high  with a better brand  of acne cover-up.  And then he wrote,  I wasn't even going  to say anything  about Trump's hair.  I live in a glass house.  I've always had  ugly,  out-of-style hair. 
[00:29:30]  Trump's hair  is a lot better  than mine,  but as I sat there  for hours,  half listening  to Donald carry on,  it struck me  exactly what  his hair looked like.  It looks like  cotton candy  made of piss.  That revelation  came to me,  and I had to  type it here,  but my hair is worse.  He doesn't quite  pull that off.  Oh, boy,  that stuck  in old Donnie's craw.  Did he make  the show,  Pendulet talked,  or was it in his book,  I don't remember now,  but those boardrooms 
[00:30:00]  that are only,  what,  10 minutes on TV?  Yeah.  Pendulet said  would go on for hours.  Yeah,  all the people  I talked to said,  like...  They would go on  for hours,  and you would have  to listen to  Donald Trump  talk about himself  and his businesses.  Oh, God.  Half the time,  it had nothing  to do with the show,  and they would  just have to sit  there for a couple  hours,  and then they would  finally do the shit  for the TV show,  and that's what  you would see  on TV,  obviously.  He does.  Some of those  boardrooms are  three and a half  hours long.  It wasn't even  three and a half  hours long.  And he's just  going into  non-sequiturs 
[00:30:30]  about his hair,  about his businesses,  about his suit.  You know,  back in 1982,  I had an opportunity  to...  Oh, and you're  just sitting there  like, fuck.  You have to listen  to all of it.  Fuck.  He wrote,  we've chosen  to make this  whack job  with the cotton  candy piss hair  and the birther shit  into someone  we want to please.  Who said that?  Penn.  Oh, he wrote that?  Oh, yeah,  he wrote that.  Yeah, he was all  in in his book.  He was very honest.  It's all water  under the bridge.  Come on up here, 
[00:31:00]  Penn.  Let me ask you  something.  He wrote,  but the celebrity  apprentice people  are honest.  They don't pretend  it's about something  beautiful,  and they don't  pretend it's fair.  It's venal,  venal?  What's that word?  V-E-N-A-L?  Yes.  Yes.  I don't know  what that means.  I know you don't.  Venal people.  Venal.  Venal?  Venal.  Just making it up now.  Whatever.  Let's go with venal.  I like that one.  It's people  clawing at stupid,  soulless shit  in front of the 
[00:31:30]  modern-day Scrooge  McDuck  in order to stay famous.  Scrooge McDuck.  Mother-day Scrooge.  So Donald Trump's  been waiting  about a year  for this.  I suddenly understand  Trump's point,  though.  He's been pretty broke.  He's been waiting.  He must have been,  last night,  he must have just  been wringing his hands  going,  aha,  my plan has all  come together,  culminating here tonight  where I will make  Penn look like  a complete jackass.  He did a whole  season of television  just to make  this guy look like 
[00:32:00]  an asshole.  He's Dr. Evil.  Knowing he would  never pick him.  That's a Dr. Evil  type plan.  Perfect.  It could have been  Gary Busey  sitting next to Penn.  Of course.  Penn never would  have won.  No.  No.  Never.  Oh, that's great.  But also,  Penn never would  have been fired  before the finale.  Nope.  So, oh man.  He wanted to do  this in front of  a huge audience.  NBA guy showed  up to a prom.  How is that allowed?  I don't know.  How come I can't  go?  That's Dwayne Wade  from the Miami Heat  because it's a, 
[00:32:30]  I told you,  because you got  to do a stunt.  You got to make  believe it's a stunt.  Yeah, huh?  You got to be like,  oh, win a fucking  prom date with a  fucking radio guy.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, it's a one.  Win a prom date.  What an awful  contest.  It really is.  No one would enter.  What an awful prize.  Any other Penn Jillette  quotes?  Or is that it?  No one would enter.  No, they wouldn't.  It's true.  Soapes the prom all angry. 
[00:33:00]  Ruining everyone's moment.  Jackass.  It's all their moment.  And now we got to  fucking make it about me.  Yeah.  Fucking just scorning  the interracial couple.  Everyone's happy for them  and you're like,  ow!  I just walk up  and point at them,  boo!  Jesus.  Boo!  Can we get Penn Jillette  on the phone today?  We could try.  He's got to be in New York.  Probably be tough.  Yeah, he's definitely.  He's never going to see  Donald Trump again,  so we might get  some good stuff out of him.  Unless he flew out  in a rage last night  immediately after the taping. 
[00:33:30]  I wonder if it's  crossed his mind,  this whole thing,  this whole conspiracy theory  that we have hashed out  here this morning.  It's only big for Penn,  though.  It's only good to get that far.  Oh, absolutely.  If Trump really wanted  to humiliate him,  he would have fired him  the first week.  Oh, Penn's very happy  because his ticket sales  have gone way up,  he said,  because of the show.  He was telling us on,  oh, well, yeah,  the other day that  more people know who he is  because of the show.  Which is hard to believe  that people don't know  who Penn and Teller are 
[00:34:00]  at this point.  He wanted just that  satisfaction of admitting  on the finale,  on television,  on live TV,  you wrote that note  and you are sorry  and you like me.  It all came together  right there.  He wanted the king  of comedy moment.  Rupert, you were right  and we were wrong.  We were wrong.  We could look out  the windows  and spit on people's heads.  Ah, look down at him.  Hey, down there.  Look at us up here.  Oh, God.  He was talking about Rupert 
[00:34:30]  when he was talking  about how great it would be.  They could just look out  a whole window  from a tall building  and say,  hey, suckers.  Like, point at all  the regular people  on the street.  Jesus.  Fucking suckers.  Yes, hey, suckers.  Well, Donald Trump's  vindictive.  You got him, though.  We learned that.  You nailed him.  Nailed him.  Perfect plan.  You got him.  You just gotta, you know,  anyone could do that.  You just have to have  a network TV show  that a lot of people watch.  You have to be, 
[00:35:00]  the whole win-lose thing  is up to you.  It's not an audience vote thing.  You can't have a vote  that you need to fix.  You have to be the final word  in who wins or loses.  Do you think at 10.58 p.m.  when Donald Trump  starts bringing up  what Penn said,  Penn is just going,  oh, what the fuck?  Oh, no.  Fuck.  It's all,  I see it now.  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Why would he  fucking fell right  into his trap?  Why would he bring this up  two minutes 
[00:35:30]  before the show  is over?  I'm a magician.  I see things.  I'm the sleight-of-hand guy  and the fooling people  and I was fooled.  But you guys,  it's a sickness, though.  Donald Trump sat on this  for a whole year.  That is epic.  Those three-hour boardroom meetings,  he could have brought it up.  Never once.  Never once.  He just sat on that.  Movie-style revenge.  That's fucking  Wrath of Khan-type revenge.  That's just sick.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  We gotta get Penn on the phone  either today or tomorrow.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We have to.  Definitely wanna talk to him.  Make sure Roland is on that one.  Penn was in every single boardroom  the whole season.  That's like 13,  however many weeks they did.  And Donald Trump  was just giving the impression  that everything's good.  You wrote that letter.  We haven't even talked about it,  but we're good.  Penn, you're doing great this season.  We're doing great.  You said some shit,  but you did the right thing.  You wrote me a letter.  We're good.  Here comes my opportunity  to humiliate you  by not talking about your charity  and by... 
[00:36:30]  They were never good.  Making you reiterate  your apology to me.  He was never good  with Penn Jillette.  100,000 to Trace,  100,000 to Lil' John.  See, I'm in Penn.  Write another book.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Another asshole  was on TV last night.  Oh.  The Biebs.  The Biebs.  Wow.  Boy, falling from grace  pretty quickly.  No, he was winning  awards last night, though.  Yeah, but that's... 
[00:37:00]  The Billboard Awards  are pretty big.  I guess, right?  That's a pretty big deal.  But I don't think  the audience was very loving.  I guess they booed him  or something?  Yeah, it was hard to tell  on TV,  but they were definitely  booing him.  Really?  He walked up there  in, like, leather pants.  He looked like an asshole.  And a leather baseball jersey  that was, like, oversized.  And then those  over-the-top, you know,  Ray-Bans.  Yep.  He tried too quickly.  Troy Kwan gold chain.  Yeah.  He's trying to be cool  and it's like that.  He tried too quickly  to go from  little teen idol boy thing 
[00:37:30]  to he's hardcore,  look out.  Shouldn't that be, like,  a slow fade?  Because that's why  a lot of people  loved the fucking guy  was because he was  so down-earth and normal.  Yeah, yeah.  With goofy hair.  He had the Bieber cut.  But now, you're right.  He went too quickly  into this,  no, I'm really cool,  I'm a rock star now.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's acting  like Kanye West,  but Kanye West  has always been  kind of an asshole.  He was never  America's sweetheart.  No.  And Bieber,  you're supposed to go  through these times privately.  You're embarrassing  18-year-olds  finding yourself shit.  Oh, boy. 
[00:38:00]  The whole country  is not supposed  to have to watch you  going through  your little douche phase,  which we all go through.  Yeah, but he has people  that should be, you know,  calming him down  and going,  look, this is not a good idea.  You're going to lose  way too much  of your fan base  too quickly.  He should go  with the handsome  young man thing  and not,  no one thinks  he's cooler.  Like, no one looks  at Bieber  and goes,  oh, shit.  No one.  He should go  with the sex symbol  I'm a good-looking  19-year-old guy thing.  Well, he's trying  to look like a badass.  He's got tattoos now.  He talks like a wigger.  No, does he?  He's got the wigger. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's completely.  Yeah, yeah.  And last night was bad.  Yeah, last night was bad.  And I just heard  a quick clip.  He sounds like an idiot.  No, he didn't.  Yes, yes.  We're obviously  way too old  to really know, but...  No, he sounds  like an idiot.  All right, good.  Is there a picture  at Moe  to see what he looked like?  Oh, he looked ridiculous.  Yeah, he's looking  all bad.  Oh, the Biebs.  Good luck to you.  There he is.  See, hang on.  It's embarrassing. 
[00:39:00]  But see, most of those  pictures are like,  that's the guy  everyone fell in love  with, his fan base anyway,  and now he's looking  like that.  Oh, no.  His hair looks like  vanilla ice now.  And he had matching pants.  And his tats, you know.  That's really...  That is vanilla ice.  That's embarrassing.  Wear a suit.  Look like a gentleman,  a young gentleman.  Yeah.  Understated.  Make the girls want to see you.  Yeah, or make them want  to go see you in the movies.  How about humility?  Like, oh, shucks.  Then they'll still  want to cream on you. 
[00:39:30]  This guy is going to have  some tough years ahead of him.  Yeah.  You think?  He's headed into  Leaf Garrett territory.  Oh, boy.  What, losing all that hair?  Yeah.  He's still winning awards, though.  Yeah, this is him  sounding like an asshole  last night.  Oh, no.  You hear the blues?  They're booing.  Oh, that's that undertone  of boo.  Right.  If you get just below  the teen girls,  you can hear everybody's booing. 
[00:40:00]  Madonna.  What the fuck is she doing?  I told you.  The dean.  She's wearing, like,  stockings and fucking panties.  Right.  No pants.  And she's grandma.  Why don't you behave yourself?  She looks like a grandma.  Is that Prince?  Yeah, it looks like him.  Yeah, it is.  Yes.  Whipper snapper.  I didn't see Prince.  He did this version of  Let's Go Crazy,  and it was fantastic.  I think it was one  of my favorite moments  of the night.  And he's not jumping  on people, either,  which is good.  Oh.  He's a bit smarter than that. 
[00:40:30]  I wish we could just  listen there.  Michelle Turner.  Hey, can we get  that performance?  Let's play that  into break today.  Let's go crazy.  A brand new, uh,  he twisted it a little bit  last night.  Yeah, he slowed it down.  Nice.  All right, here's the beeps.  I think it's, uh,  I'm 19 years old.  Ah.  19 years old.  Where's the D?  I'm 19 years old.  I'm 19 years old.  You forgot the D.  Ah. 
[00:41:00]  Oh.  I'm 19 years old.  I'm 19 years old.  I, I, I, I think, uh,  I think I'm doing  a pretty good job.  What is he saying?  I don't know.  It's like confidence.  And basically,  from my heart,  I, I, I really just  want to say,  it should, it should,  it should really be  about the music,  it should be about  the craft,  the craft that, 
[00:41:30]  that I'm,  that I'm making.  This is not a,  this is not a gimmick.  I'm not,  I'm not a,  this is not a gimmick.  I, I'm a,  I'm an artist  and I,  I, I should be  taken seriously  and, and, and this,  all this other  bull should not be,  be spoken of.  Oh, man.  Why do you say,  you don't say this?  You don't say this stuff.  You, you think it,  you hope,  you hope it's presented  that way.  Oh, my God.  You, you do things  to present that,  but you can never say,  look, I, I'm seriously, 
[00:42:00]  guys.  Right, right.  He does what it is.  He just told the crowd,  I'm seriously.  Seriously.  That's perfect.  All you have to do  is look back through history  and think,  has there ever been a scenario  where somebody has said,  I should be taken seriously  and people have responded with,  he's right.  Yeah, yeah.  You know,  now that he mentions that,  Yeah, James Dean had to say that.  Oh, that's right.  He never had to say that.  Yeah, the Beatles,  each one of them individually said,  we need to be taken.  Oh, that's right.  No.  You, you don't say that.  It's, it's just.  You just, you just do your shit.  You are taken seriously 
[00:42:30]  or you're not.  You should act like people  are taking you seriously  and go,  and thank you for taking me seriously.  This means a lot to me.  And then people go,  oh, yeah, I guess he is being taken.  You don't stand there and go,  yo, y'all,  pipe down for a motherfucking minute.  That sounded like,  wah.  Well, that means it's,  it's obviously getting to him.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He really hears those boos.  Because in the,  anytime his name is in the news,  it's never about his music  and his craft.  It's about,  who's he going out with?  Is he doing drugs? 
[00:43:00]  What the fuck?  He's puking on stage.  So he must be like,  you know,  I, I, I'm doing all this work  and like,  no one is taking me seriously.  But instead of saying that,  you ought to be happy that you're,  it's like the reason is  because the music is not great.  No.  So the fact that you have  an amazing career,  you don't fucking unmask  the fact that it's not great.  Right.  Let people who still enjoy it,  enjoy it.  Shut your face.  Be happy.  I don't even think it's about the music.  I think it's about this shit.  How he presents himself. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  That really bothers people.  This only makes it worse,  by the way.  Right.  Oh, God, yeah.  Watch and go,  ew,  shut the fuck up,  you baby.  Woken up.  I want to thank my manager,  Scooter Braun.  I want to thank my family at home.  I want to thank my mother,  my father.  Booze.  I want to thank Jesus Christ.  For what?  Mom,  I love you so much. 
[00:44:00]  Dad,  I love you.  Little brother and sister,  I love you so much.  Thank you guys so much.  Fans,  you're incredible.  Do you think he knew they were booing them?  Oh, yeah.  You never not know  someone's booing you.  But that's also the kind of breakdown  that happens when  you're a little kid  and you live in this insulated world  where,  yes,  you're wonderful,  Justin.  Everybody loves you.  And then the girls are screaming  and, oh,  I guess I'm wonderful.  Everybody loves me.  He could do no wrong  at that young age. 
[00:44:30]  He's on Ellen.  He's on fucking all  and they love,  everyone loved him.  There's nothing.  And now it's just like,  That's when he was tossable,  though.  Right.  That's the problem.  Yes.  Everybody even thought  his documentary was inspiring.  Oh, yeah.  No,  he really did work hard  for this.  Yes.  Now,  now he's just  on stage  in front of a national audience  whining  that he's not  being taken seriously.  Oh, boy.  That doesn't get you  taken seriously.  Someone's got to tell him  that this gangster thing 
[00:45:00]  is humiliating.  Just be a nice  little white kid.  The rappers will like you  anyway because you  bring in business.  Yeah.  That's why they like you.  Rappers like you  if you bring in business.  Money, yo.  Yeah,  because if they put him  on a hook,  singles will sell.  Yeah,  they don't care,  but you don't need to,  they don't look at him  and go,  fucking Justin's here.  Everybody calm down.  He might get angry.  No one's afraid of you.  I won't be taken seriously.  Be the white kid  that walks in and goes,  hi, guys,  I'm white,  and I'll be happy to see you.  Yes.  Be yourself. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, imagine what he's like  when he's hanging out  with fucking rappers  in a studio.  He probably,  like his voice  gets even more affected.  I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah,  that's what I'm talking about.  Me and you eat fondue.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't like that?  Fondue line.  I don't like that.  It's a big boy line.  No one does, apparently.  No.  He is an ass.  Anything else  from the Billboard Music Awards?  He looked,  let me think.  Yeah.  He's the second biggest, 
[00:46:00]  he's the second biggest,  like, loser of the night,  last night.  He looks like an asshole,  but not quite as much  as the Donald made Penn look.  Penn's number one.  Penn,  the biggest tool  of the evening,  last night.  And Donald's watching  everybody make fun  of Justin Bieber  and thinking to himself,  I got Penn worse.  Yeah, yeah.  I got him worse.  Oh, it doesn't matter. 
[00:46:30]  Penn,  you talk with your voice  affected,  you implied we eat fondue.  Yes, I did.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I think that,  and what,  some dude fucking  almost broke  some lady's neck last night?  Yeah, Miguel.  That's Miguel, yo.  I don't know Miguel.  What is he saying?  Miguel's big in the R&B world.  Is it a song we know, though?  Probably not.  What's the song?  I'm very popular  with R&B folk.  You are?  Yes.  I don't know what it's called.  But what did he try to do?  They had a little pit area? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, he was trying to...  And he was trying to jump over  the little tiny pit area?  And then he ended up  dropping a Hulk Hogan leg drop  on his way down  on some chick.  Yeah, it's just some bra  that's in that area.  He thought he could  clear the audience  between the little  walking platforms.  Yeah, everyone's talking  about this.  Look at this.  He missed.  Oh, boy, did he miss.  All right, let's see.  More of the  look at this shit  from the Open Anthony show.  Oh, he jumps.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  He fucking got it  right on the throat. 
[00:47:30]  Holy fuck.  And then he just keeps singing.  You're a fucking asshole.  What a self-centered...  Let me see how he nailed that.  Because they were making it  look like it was  that big, fat, blonde chick.  Is this lip-syncing or no?  No, he hit two people,  but the one he...  The one he fucking like...  If you watch the clip,  they get that girl  away from there  like immediately.  They walk her right off.  So she had to get hurt.  Oh, she slammed her  back of the head  on his stage.  He'd get a concussion.  He trapped her neck  in the crook of his knee.  And why can't we hear  the audio?  I think the... 
[00:48:00]  Because they don't  own the audio?  Huh?  No, no, no.  You'll be able to hear this.  Oh, okay, okay.  You should be able to.  But the guy continues singing?  Yeah, he really does.  Oh, that's not going  to work out well for him.  Is he singing  or lip-syncing, though?  He might have had to.  I don't know.  If he's lip-syncing,  he might have had to keep going.  After you almost break  some chick's neck,  I think it's over, Johnny.  You got to acknowledge  what you just did.  You better recognize.  He doesn't even acknowledge.  Watch this.  Self-centered ass. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  It's not lip-syncing.  Oh, he thought it was her,  so he grabbed her?  Yeah, yeah.  What a dummy.  Actually...  So he thought it was  the blonde that he hit.  Yeah, but it took a few seconds  for him to do anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, his first instinct  was just to keep singing.  Right.  Yeah, that absolutely  was his first instinct.  He would have grabbed  the chubby bleach blonde anyway.  Oh, and... 
[00:49:00]  Those people.  Well, what are you going to do?  Do you guys like  that Bruno Mars song?  I really like it.  I like Bruno Mars.  There's something about him.  I hate to admit it.  It's a big one.  The one that's on now,  like the Heaven or whatever.  I really like that one.  Every song he puts out  is catchy as all hell.  He's good.  Although he sounds like  Sting in that one song.  Big fucking time.  Is that the hit?  That's Heaven, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think that's a bad thing.  Locked out of Heaven.  It's very popular.  You know this song, right?  This song is very popular.  If you didn't know better,  you would swear it's some,  like, like... 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You would swear  this is like an outtake  from Zenyatta Mandata.  Everything.  The guitar.  One of the award shows,  you performed it with Sting.  No, I know.  Yeah.  But this is such  an old police song.  Yeah.  This is totally police.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  It's a good song, though.  Sending out an SOS.  Yeah.  Message in a bottle.  Message in a bottle. 
[00:50:00]  How old is this guy?  Like, 20?  No, he's older than that.  But he's in his 20s, I think.  You think he's what  Justin Bieber wants to be?  Yeah, because he started  as, like, a songwriter.  He's a musician.  See?  He's talented.  He plays instruments.  He plays instruments he produces.  Holy fuck, is that the police sound?  Yeah, yeah.  You think the police are cool with that?  I guess they are,  because Sting performed with them. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Do girls like him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is short, though.  Justin Bieber likes to think  he's, um...  He's somebody who's talented.  You know?  Right.  Like a singer-songwriter.  This fucking prodigy.  He is.  He's not.  He's a...  He was a mediocre singer  who had the high voice  when he was a kid.  He had the look going.  And he can't fucking capitalize.  He's not a...  He's not a dynamic dancer 
[00:51:00]  and entertainer.  You think Bruno kicks his ass  in talent?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely, yeah.  I would think so, too.  How does a guy like Bieber  make a transition  without embarrassing himself?  There has to be a way to do it  where people wind up liking him  and go,  wow, I still like this.  How about natural?  I think the transition...  Thank you.  I think the transition  isn't natural  and it's way too quick  and that's what's bothering  a lot of his fan base.  Yeah, he's got to be  out of the spotlight  for a little while.  Yeah, yeah.  And then come back  with a little new image  or whatever.  He's changing his image  every week.  Maybe go and write songs 
[00:51:30]  for somebody else  if he's so talented.  Because he doesn't know  who the fuck he is  so every week he's coming out  with some new image  thinking that's going to stick.  So maybe stop the hip-hop shit.  Just be your fucking self.  Yeah, yeah.  And maybe do a nice duet  with someone.  Take some time  to figure out who you are.  Right.  Maybe do a duet  with an older lady  like a Cher or a Bette Midler.  That's what I love to see.  Bette Midler.  Bette Midler's a cunt.  Yes, she is.  I gave her a bit  smashing on Twitter.  She's an asshole.  I saw that.  What happened?  A friend of mine  has a son  who was in the military 
[00:52:00]  and they were out  eating  in a steak place.  And again,  I've taken enough  celebrity photos  where I know  when it's right and wrong.  So my friend said  that him and his son  were there  and his son's girlfriend  just got back from Iraq.  And Bette Midler,  they saw eating.  The restaurant,  he said,  was very light.  There wasn't a lot of people.  And they said  they waited  until she was done  and as she was walking by,  the girl said hello to Bette.  They must have waited  a long fucking time.  Yeah, she's a big lady.  She's a big lady  that can eat.  So they said hello  and they gave her a hand. 
[00:52:30]  She said Bette  said hello to her  and said,  oh, you're beautiful.  And then she said,  well, can I have a picture with you?  My mother and I are big fans.  And Bette Midler's like,  no, dear.  And my friend said  that they were right by the door.  So it wasn't like  she would have gotten mobbed  and it wasn't a full restaurant.  And then my friend was like,  look, they're in the military.  She just got back from Iraq  and she was like,  oh, and then she said,  oh, thank you, dear.  Or darling.  And then just walked out with that.  And it really annoyed me.  And then people,  I say that on Twitter  and people are like,  what, because she's not  for bloodletting?  Bloodletting.  You don't have to agree 
[00:53:00]  with the war,  you fucking Twitter troll faggots.  It's just a courtesy  you show somebody  in the military.  And no,  Bette Midler's not obligated.  I didn't say Bette Midler  should be drummed  out of show business.  I didn't say Bette Midler  should go to jail.  I just thought she was  for saying no to somebody  who's active in the military.  I can't picture a scenario  where I would ever say no  to someone who just got back  from a tour of Iraq.  Ever.  That's what I should have  told Joe Pesci.  Oh, man.  He just got back from Iraq.  Yeah, I was reading 
[00:53:30]  some of her tweets  and oh, my God.  She was actually saying  that she was happy  with the IRS  going after the racist  Tea Party groups.  And it's like, really?  Like, no matter  who they're going after,  you're for  a government agency  as powerful as the IRS  just targeting  certain groups and people?  You should never be happy  at that.  Holy fuck, you dummy.  Think she felt that way  about McCarthy  going after perceived communists?  Yeah, you got it. 
[00:54:00]  Did that witch hunt  was okay in her mind?  Sure.  And this is  a hate group.  What's a hate group?  How is the Tea Bar  a hate group?  Yeah, they hate fucking taxes.  They hate the destruction  of the Constitution.  She's another fucking  out-of-touch celebrity  who has nobody around her  to go, shut up.  Yeah, yeah.  No one around her  says anything but  oh, Bette, good point.  Fuck her.  Good point.  She should be tap dancing  in front of a glory hole.  That's how she started.  I should respect that.  I was reading some of the  fans' tweets to her  because between me  and Jimmy 
[00:54:30]  having a little  misunderstanding  well, not misunderstanding  a little tiff with her  the fans got involved  and called her  you know  some choice words.  I said to my friend  when I saw the Twitter starting  I'm like  no one has called  this woman a cunt  in 40 years  and now 10 people  just did that.  Yes.  Indeed he do.  I just thought  it was really shitty  especially knowing  the circumstances  it wasn't like  she was in an airport  and trying to lay low  then you understand  look, she doesn't want  to start a firestorm.  Wait, that means 
[00:55:00]  you're bringing up Pesci again.  No one was around.  It was just me and Pesci  and two other fucking people.  Pesci didn't want  to look like shit  he was traveling.  He didn't want to look  like shit in a picture.  But Bette's out.  She's out on the town.  Dressed to the nines.  Right.  Pesci should have  taken a picture with me.  I'm telling you.  I looked like shit too.  Jesus.  You should have said that.  I know I should have said that.  Speaking of Pesci  I saw Jersey Boys Friday.  My brother took  for a birthday present.  Wow.  To go see Jersey Boys. 
[00:55:30]  How was it?  It was pretty goddamn good.  That's what people  were saying.  Your brother took  you to see Jersey Boys  as a gift?  Yeah.  Went with me,  my brother,  my sister  and Carol,  Joe's girlfriend.  And yeah.  It was fucking  It was good, right?  It was pretty goddamn good.  People are saying it's good.  It was pretty fucking good.  They know how to figure out  that Broadway shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They really know how to do that.  You had a real  night on the town,  did you?  Night on the town.  Night on the town. 
[00:56:00]  But it sounds like  you had a good time.  It was pretty goddamn good.  You went to Saudis after.  Oh, it was wonderful.  It was fucking good.  What's it about?  Were you surprised  how good it was?  It's about the four seasons  and how they started  and they do an amazing job  recreating the tunes.  But it's also about  how they got famous.  And a lot of them  like a little  some mob ties there.  And Pesci was a friend  of one of the guys 
[00:56:30]  in the band.  And there was  a lot of interaction.  He like kind of hooked up  I didn't know that.  one of the guys  in the band.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they had him  like being a real  little wormy kid.  Doing a Pesci impression  on the stage.  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  What's the four seasons  big hit?  I don't know.  They had many, many hits.  A lot of songs  you just know, right?  They had  then there was the  then  no, they had  some of the old ones, 
[00:57:00]  you know.  Dawn was one.  Why is he on the  fucking ball over here?  Who's back there?  Travis.  Just sitting there  fucking having a good time  looking up hockey stats.  Two seconds away  from playing Sherry  and you mentioned Dawn.  Oh, Sherry.  I thought it was Iraq.  Oh, they're the Sherry group.  What happened to Iraq today?  He's got a personal day  for himself.  Oh, nice.  Oh, yeah.  This one is  one of their hits.  Yeah.  This is an old,  old one  from the early 60s. 
[00:57:30]  Wait, this is a  big fucking song.  Yeah, it's a big one.  Did all right, huh?  Yeah, he had  one of those  fucking weird  high voices.  Why do fools  fall in love?  Yeah.  Do that one.  That's Frankie Lyman  and the Teenagers.  Uh-oh.  I saw  four seasons.  Did they do it first?  Other hits, maybe.  A lot of these guys  kind of did  each other's songs, right?  Yeah, whose song  was that?  Oh, wow. 
[00:58:00]  Some of these songs  were...  Ragdoll.  Sherry.  Big Girls Don't Cry.  Big Girls Don't Cry.  Oh, wow, of course.  Walk Like a Man.  Walk Like a Man.  Of course.  Can we hear  the Why do fools  fall in love?  I thought that was  Frankie Lyman's song.  Not a way.  It's old. 
[00:58:30]  No, this is...  Whoever's version of it,  Frankie Lyman's is better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they wrote this.  They did all right  with this song, though.  Maybe they did write it.  Then there was  one of the later ones.  Oh, man.  I can't do it  with this in my head.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, What a Night.  That was them?  That was them, too.  Oh, What a Night.  Yeah, play that one.  That was a big hit.  Late September?  Yeah.  Back in 63?  What year did that one  come out? 
[00:59:00]  Better be 63.  No, no.  They was talking  about 63,  but I think it was  the 70s?  Yeah, 75.  75.  This was a giant hit  in 75.  I don't have it  by the Four Seasons.  I have it by the Dells.  What?  Let me hear it  by the Dells.  No.  Oh.  Why wouldn't we have it  by the Four Seasons?  Oh, What a Night.  No.  The song is called...  Might just not be... 
[00:59:30]  I mean, it's possible  it's not just...  What's it called?  It's called December 1963.  All right.  December 1963.  Who the fuck...  Why would you fucking  call your song that?  And I call it  Oh, What a Night.  It's December 1963,  parentheses,  Oh, What a Night.  All right.  It's always ignoring  parentheses.  Yeah.  You gotta have  parentheses in there.  They had a lot of hits.  They had an amazing  amount of hits.  Oh, my God.  It's a massive song.  This was giant in 75.  I would go as far as 
[01:00:00]  to call them prolific.  Huge.  Oh.  I played the Frankie Valli.  I thought it was  a Frankie Valli song.  Okay.  This is their original song?  This is Frankie Valli,  yeah.  Yeah.  Because he kind of  went off and did some shit  at the Four Seasons.  Was he a member of them?  The Four Seasons?  Yeah.  He was like the lead singer.  This is labeled Frankie Valli  and the Four Seasons.  Yes.  After a while,  it became Frankie Valli  and the Four Seasons.  Like Diana Ross.  Once they were like,  hey, shitheads,  I'll leave you behind  if you still want me here.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Take your cut  and deal with it.  Take your cut  and deal with it.  I'm just gonna go  and find some musicians.  Their big moment  was the songwriter  that joined  the Four Seasons  was writing  all these fucking songs.  Oh.  Frankie Valli  didn't write the songs,  really.  It was this songwriter.  And his claim to fame  was he was a one-hit  wonder with,  she's got short shorts.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  He was the short shorts guy.  And then he wrote  all these songs  for fucking Frankie Valli  and the Four Seasons.  No kidding. 
[01:01:00]  So, yeah.  And it was really funny  and like,  it's, it's,  you know,  the show's been there  quite a while  and it's not going anywhere  anytime soon  so it had to be good.  Why was December of 63  such a good time?  I don't know,  he was just talking about  like,  back in the day.  The whole song  is him explaining  why it was so great.  Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.  Good song.  And the horn section,  it was like,  you wanted a horn section  in there?  Bang, bang.  And it sounded great.  The guy that fucking  did the Lee vocals,  he was the guy 
[01:01:30]  from the actual,  the first cast  of the show.  He came back  and he's doing it now.  So he was like,  it was a good show though.  I might have to go see  this dumb thing.  Do you want to hear  the Jersey Boys version  of this?  Yeah, yeah.  Let me hear  the Jersey Boys version.  The Jersey Boys version.  They do,  they do Broadway  up the endings.  Oh really?  You know,  they go,  oh,  what,  oh,  no.  They have to do that?  Why?  Those big Broadway endings  and songs.  Why do they have to do that?  I don't know,  it's Broadway. 
[01:02:00]  Oh,  look.  Girls,  oh wait.  Maybe that was it.  I like that they talk  into the song.  Good acting there.  No,  this isn't the guy.  This is the songwriter guy.  There's probably two versions of it.  Wait,  wait,  you know who this sounds like though?  I do.  Barry Williams.  It sounds like,  turn this up.  This is the songwriter singing it.  Not the Frankie Valli guy. 
[01:02:30]  Oh,  Travis,  excuse me.  Are there two versions?  No,  this is the only one.  Wow.  That's Barry all the way.  It's Barry Williams.  A lot of people asked me over the weekend  if I reached out to Barry Williams  and apologized  and I'll be honest,  I was too scared to reach out to him.  He was pissed.  Let's give him a call.  Play one of the other ones  from Jersey Boys cast  where the guy actually sounds like.  I was just filling Jimmy in.  I woke up Barry Williams on Friday.  He was pissed.  He was worried you were going to give his number out.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  And I still haven't reached out to just to say sorry.  I'm going to text him and say I'm sorry.  When?  It's three days ago.  I'm serious.  I know how pissed he was.  Why was he pissed?  He used to be friends.  I could tell.  Play ragdoll.  Because it was quarter to six in the morning his time.  There.  That's right.  Who else is talking about him, honestly?  He was scared  because when the phone rings that early,  usually it's bad news.  Oh.  I think that's what got him.  Is this ragdoll?  You did give him bad news.  The cast is still alive.  I guess so.  And what better stage?  I don't know.  I was going to play Dawn. 
[01:03:30]  The one right here at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I don't know Dawn.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they are.  My old friends.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Famers.  The original four seasons.  Wow.  That's.  Spaz nailed it.  Yeah.  That's the gay voice.  Oh, this song.  Yeah, the guy did it like really. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, he does.  He does a pretty good job.  Absolutely.  It was good.  I laughed.  I cried.  I felt great about myself.  See what I did there?  On the rag.  What was the big finale?  The over-the-top song that ended it all.  I thought it was December 63.  It must have been, right?  Yeah, but apparently, you know.  According to Travis. 
[01:04:30]  I know.  All right.  We should take a break.  Can we play Prince?  Yes.  Right from here.  Prince.  What did he do last night again?  Let's go crazy?  Mm-hmm.  Let's go crazy from last night during the Billboard Music Awards.  Prince came out and did this.  I 
[01:05:00]  Well,  If you don't like  What the living is 
[01:05:30]  Take a look around you  At least you got friends  You call my lady  For a friend of mine  Beat your phone  Try to know the door  Let me tell you what I heard  Don't keep going  Let the elevator break  Take a look around you  Take a look around you 
[01:06:00]  Burn, burn, burn, burn, and I feel it  Put us in the truck  Let's go  It starts now  You're ready to live out loud  guitar solo  We'll be right back. 
[01:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:07:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:07:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:08:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:08:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:09:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:09:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:10:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:10:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:11:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:11:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:12:00]  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts. 
[01:12:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:13:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:13:30]  He's on a schedule where he does touring and then he goes back to England and he gets treatments.  So I'm doing something with them, I think, I'm doing something with them, I think, in June here in New York.  But this was the label, but this was the label, but I got to go out today and I got to go out today and I got to go out today and all of a sudden have the new album delivered to me. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, see what the hardships are there, Jimmy.  Oh, God, do I love it?  Oh, God, do I love this new music? 
[01:14:30]  I mean it's in your kids, I think, I got to go out here in New York and it's been关ets on the actor and they're in New York in New York, okay, what am I going to like that? 
[01:15:00]  It's like you do this radio interview, and then they play some of the songs, and then they sell it to radio stations, and we get to play it here on Sirius, which I played on the Boneyard, which was nice.  I'm very happy.  Ooh.  I hear Ozzy and Sharon are back together, too.  You got your suitcase here again.  Yeah.  I know.  Traveling Jim and out of his suitcase.  But I'm done after the Stress Factory this weekend.  I'm done traveling.  I'm done with everything.  That's this weekend already?  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Thursday through Sunday.  Fuck. 
[01:15:30]  I want to read a couple text messages from my cleaning lady.  The people that follow me on Twitter enjoyed this immensely yesterday.  I had the kids all weekend.  My wife's doing some things, and so I had to babysit my kids the entire weekend.  So I was just looking for a break, just a couple hours, go to the gym, just walk around, anything, get a cup of fucking coffee.  And so I was desperate.  Like, you know, I got my go-to people that watch my kids, one being my sister and one being a lady that might cook for us. 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  And the cleaning lady is at the bottom of the list, but she does a good job.  But the problem is she doesn't speak English too well.  No speaky?  Well, me and Jimmy share with a cleaning lady.  She's a very nice woman.  So I texted her yesterday because I was feeling pretty desperate.  I was like, I've got to get the fuck out of this house.  It's not all fun and games, trust me.  I want to get the hell out of the situation for a couple hours. 
[01:16:30]  So I wrote her.  I wrote, can you do three hours today?  And she wrote, and I swear to you, because somebody said, is this a bit?  No, it's not a bit.  She wrote, hi, I'm sorry, but today we are going to do something to my grandmother and I have to go with it.  But maybe I can go with you as 4 or 4.30 if you want.  Oh, that sounds ominous.  All right.  I'm going to do something to the grandmother.  Sorry, but today we are going to do something to my grandmother and I have to go with it. 
[01:17:00]  Wow.  Did you ever find out what it was?  No.  I would assume, I mean, you know.  I know what it is because I know the grandmother, what her thing is.  Oh, yeah, what it is?  The grandmother, they're forcing her into scat porn.  Obviously, it's broken English, but could you imagine if it was real?  Like, they decided they have to take out the grandma and she has to go with it? 
[01:17:30]  She was against it, but she knows she has to go with it.  She's got to go with it.  So I just wrote, um, okay, because I had no idea what that meant.  And then she writes me a couple hours later and she wrote, want that fence when I can  go home now, but that's not a, but, but it's not a question.  Want that fence.  She, she ended with an exclamation point.  So this wasn't a question, even though it, it feels like a question. 
[01:18:00]  Uh-huh.  She wrote, want that fence when I can go home now.  That's what she wrote me.  That doesn't make sense.  So I wrote, okay, sounds good.  Gracias.  But what did she mean in the first place?  Which one?  Do you even know the fence?  Want that fence when I can go home now.  Well, a lot of people, you know, it's kind of cool when you throw some of this shit out  there because then you realize a lot of people deal with the same stuff. 
[01:18:30]  You know, she, English is her second language.  So she knows what she wants to say to me.  So then she fucking puts it into some kind of translation program.  But she's, she has a horrible translation program.  If it comes out, want that fence when I can go home now.  Well, yeah, what could that be?  Fence.  And, and she's taking out her grandma.  What does this have to do with babysitting my kids?  Oh, someone's saying it could mean child gate.  Want that fence when I can go home now. 
[01:19:00]  No, but we've never talked about child.  All right.  Then it's not child gate.  What is fence?  What is that fence?  What is fence in Spanish?  Oh, you know what we could do?  El Fenso.  El Fenso.  Put this into English.  Uh, uh, uh, how do we do this?  Then we need Mars to read it.  Oh, I want that fence.  Put it in English to Spanish and then have Mars read it.  Oh, what, what the Spanish means.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I knew there was a way to do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So put in, this was all just to try to watch my kids for a couple hours. 
[01:19:30]  And, um, and someone noticed the timestamp on my text messages.  And I had explained that too.  I'm obsessed with candy crush, which is a dumb girlish girly game.  And, uh, someone taught me if you, if you, you know, uh, fuck around with the time on your phone, you don't have to wait.  Right.  Cause it's the most clever thing they're doing with this candy crush to get you addicted, but they only give you a certain amount of lives.  And you either have to ask your Facebook friends for more lives, which I'm not going to do.  Think how many you could have with all your Facebook friends. 
[01:20:00]  Or you could pay 99 cents every time you want more lives.  That's crazy.  Uh, and which I was doing, but then someone said, look, dude, all you have to do is, uh, you know, change the time on your phone.  You get more lives.  How far ahead are you?  Well, I was six hours ahead at this point.  But then when you put your phone back to normal, then it's like a ridiculous amount of time before you could play candy crush.  Yeah.  I would assume that you can't get something for nothing.  But what I do is I play with it until I have to go to bed.  And then I, I know I have eight hours to kill where I can't play candy crush anymore, but I'm sleeping. 
[01:20:30]  And so by the time I wake up, I'm good to go again.  But that's why the timestamp, I've been fucking around with the candy crush and moving my, moving my time around to get more lives.  What's the, what's the simple object of that game?  Because I know it's one of those very simple.  It's not really that simple.  It's just one of those mindless puzzle games.  You know?  Yeah.  You got to clear boards and all sorts of shit.  A board clearing game, right?  Well, it's more than that.  You got to mash the candies.  Yeah.  Mash the candies. 
[01:21:00]  You got to mash the candies to make super candies.  No, it's a friend losing thing.  Because you go to your friends, you're like, could you help me out?  I got some candy.  Hello?  Hello?  I need candy crush lives.  Hello?  Then you got this dumb chocolate thing that just starts growing around the board.  Oh, man.  Which makes it harder.  You can't have that.  And then you got to drop ingredients all the way to the bottom.  So you got to figure out pathways to get them to the bottom.  It's, it's quite addicting.  Oh, you want to put that in there?  By the way, you do know that language will no longer be a barrier someday. 
[01:21:30]  Like, you see how this Google, oh, future, Jimmy, Spanish to English, English to Spanish.  Fast forward a few years, once all of a sudden we have those things, it'll be like the U.N.  We'll all just have them and talk to people in different languages.  Jimmy, language is not a barrier at all in my life because I'm sitting there last night  around about five o'clock, the doorbell rings and she shows up.  She just showed up.  So I was able to communicate, get the fuck over here. 
[01:22:00]  Even though it came out really strange, in the end, I was, I was, I was surprised because  I didn't, I didn't know what want that fence when I could go home now means.  No one knows what that means.  I didn't know that meant I'm on my way over.  So I was just hoping against hope that she was actually going to like, somehow we were  going to be able to communicate and she was going to get over to my house, which she  did.  Fuck, does that mean that?  Huh?  How does that mean that at all?  I don't know, but it worked out in the end.  I asked her if she could watch my kids for three hours.  I mean, she was there maybe an hour and a half.  I just got a quick fucking breather, but I was able to communicate that to her in the 
[01:22:30]  end.  I, I don't know if you were able to communicate that to her.  If she showed up, I did.  I wrote, can you do three hours today?  She wrote, hi, I'm sorry, but today we are going to do something to my grandmother and  I have to go with it.  But maybe I could go with you as four or four 30.  If you want, I wrote, um, okay.  A couple hours later, she writes, want that fence when I could go home now.  I wrote, okay, sounds good.  And then, uh, a mere hour later, she showed up at my, uh, front door. 
[01:23:00]  Want that fence when I could go home now.  Want that fence.  Are you translating that to Spanish?  Yeah.  All right.  Now where is Mars?  Oh, wait, you know Spanish, right?  No, he doesn't know Spanish.  He grew up with some Spanish.  He's a fucking...  He got raised by a Spanish lady.  How do you say fence in Spanish, Sam?  Okay.  Uh. 
[01:23:30]  I don't...  Oh, wait, I thought Mars was...  Wait, someone is saying maybe she's talking into her fucking phone.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Maybe she's...  She's talking Spanish into her phone, so the phone is fucking it up a little bit, and  then she pushes whatever program she's got to throw that into...  English.  English.  Yeah, because...  Do they have that program?  I don't know, because if you're using just a basic translator online, I don't think they  fuck it up this bad.  Hmm.  Yeah, I don't know...  Oh, fence also means near in Spanish. 
[01:24:00]  What?  That's what someone's saying.  All right, let me say fence.  Let me see.  So fence...  Want that near when I can go home now, instead of want that fence when I can go home now.  I don't know.  I'm trying to see if anybody has an idea.  She might be saying I'm near.  Do you want me to come by?  Oh, yeah, that's what she meant in the end, but I mean...  You know, it says, want that fence where I can go home now.  After I figured all this out, after the fact, I was like, okay, that obviously meant I'm 
[01:24:30]  done with my grandmother, whatever the fuck they did to the grandmother, and I can come  over now.  Mars, what does that...  Just read that...  What is it Spanish?  Yeah.  What does that say?  First of all, read it to everybody, and then tell me what it means.  Read it first.  All right, what does that mean?  What does that mean?  Would you like me to go...  Do you want me to...  Do you want me to go when I can to your house now? 
[01:25:00]  Doesn't really...  Yeah, that's what she's trying to say.  All right, so that's...  Because vaya is how they're translating fence, but that also means to go.  That's the verb.  Oh, I told you.  It's ear.  See, what my Spanish cleaning lady wrote was, want that fence when I can go home now.  That's what she wrote in English.  The word fence is also used for near.  Sam just said that.  And that other Spanish that other people talk.  That dirty Spanish.  That other one. 
[01:25:30]  No, the proper Spanish.  Proper Spanish.  Oh, proper Spanish.  Proper Spanish.  Do we, Mars?  I'm going to speak that shit around here.  We know how to talk that shit.  There you go.  So it worked out in the end.  Yeah.  I got a babysitter for a couple hours.  Look at that.  Got out of the house.  Yeah.  I was really amazed when that doorbell rang, though.  I was like, holy fuck, this works.  Because you didn't know fence meant fucking...  Whatever it means.  What?  Yeah, I'm near.  When I was responding to her, I was just being polite.  I had no idea what she was telling me.  So I just wrote, okay, sounds good. 
[01:26:00]  Thanks.  Yeah, she could have said anything.  Yeah.  Let me throw all your possessions out when I'm here.  Sure, I'll get rid of them.  Right.  She must have just been saying, I'm near your house.  You want me to come over now?  Yeah, a lot of people say, and it also means she was close.  All right, but that's not what it said in English.  It says fucking fence.  It says fucking fence.  Thank you, Sam.  That's what she typed out.  I'd be very confused if I got that text message.  Want that fence when I could go home now.  Yeah.  I said I'd ask for a babysitter, not a fence.  Imagine if she showed up in a fencing outfit and just started poking you. 
[01:26:30]  Because she thought you wanted some Olympic help.  She must talk into her phone, because I think she knows enough English where she would look  at this and go, this doesn't make any sense.  Ah, there were the fence that could.  Here's what I caught her doing.  She was fucking out.  She dusts everything.  Yeah.  She was dusting over my book covers with autographs on them.  I'm like, no.  No.  She's like, no, but I just...  I'm like, no, you don't.  Oh, no.  She did not put cloth on those signatures.  Oh, my gosh.  She's going to be smearing all the autographs. 
[01:27:00]  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I just was smeared on the boxing glove.  I clean it.  That was Ollie's autograph.  I was smeared.  Yeah, but at least your Buzz Aldrin book would be all right.  Yes, that's true.  It certainly would be, because Buzz signed it inside.  Buzz Aldrin, he's obsessed with Mars.  He was all over TV this weekend.  Buzz Salino.  Yes.  Buzz Aldrin's obsessed with you.  He loves you, dude.  He loves you.  Yeah.  I just put L in front of, like, English words when I talk to her. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  And I feel like I'm having, like, a bilingual conversation with her.  Yeah.  No, it'd be like her saying the, and then just talking Spanish.  I just...  I'll say stuff like, el dirtio, and I'll point to, like, a message.  Oh, see, they don't like that.  That's Lucy Spanish.  That's Lucy Ricardo Spanish.  I do that, though.  Can't you learn, like, four sentences?  No, I know a word or two here.  After six years of Spanish, that's about it.  Yeah.  Just a word or two.  Anyway, so that worked out well for me yesterday. 
[01:28:00]  Dirtio.  El dirtio.  I have said that one, yes.  And why would you write, why would you say the dirty?  Just so, because she's Spanish.  So I'm like, hey, el dirtio, and I'll just point over there.  Add a little Spanish in there.  I'm not even joking.  It's got to put an O in there.  It's not a joke.  I actually say that.  It sounds condescending.  Yes, it does.  Oh, boy.  I'd be insulted.  I get laughed at by a lot of people in my house.  El made-o.  Yeah.  El dirty-o.  El stop laughing, oh, bitch.  Oh.  Anyway. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  I try to keep English-speaking people in my house.  Except for the pool guys.  I went outside to check what was going on with the pool, and a Spanish guy was, you know,  he's kneeling down by the edge of the pool doing something.  Right.  So I'm like, so, what's the scoop today?  And he gives that, like, smile look up.  Oh, no.  And just nods at me.  That panic he's having.  I'm like, all right.  Not getting anywhere here.  Back in the house. 
[01:29:00]  Bug it.  Yeah, they give you that look like, ah.  See.  And he just nods his head, yes.  Mr. Anthony.  That's when you say, you look at him and you go, el scoopo.  El pulo.  No, el scoopo.  Yeah.  Yes, it works.  I'm telling you.  Try it.  I know que pasa, que paso, whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  They keep showing that leg drop over and over again on every news channel.  Did you want to see the video?  They've just shown it five times in a row and seen that.  Let me see the one with the commentary by Jim, uh, Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler. 
[01:29:30]  I just tweeted this.  It's hilarious.  You have to get it.  Here it comes.  From the home of the family.  The home.  It's loud.  Holy shit.  The sound effect just right.  The stomping of the man.  Yeah, yeah.  Roll out with the leg drop.  That's good.  That's just the stage thud.  That's a funny video right there.  What an idiot.  Not as funny as, um, Chip, actually, with the sunglasses.  Those were hilarious.  That was...  Did you see the Vine?  Did you see the Vine video? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm behind on Vine videos right now.  I got a bunch of them.  I just threw them.  It's ridiculous.  That's so easy.  Yeah.  Chip, you're right.  They are.  Fuck yeah.  Oh.  That's a different one.  Which one is this one?  That's a different one.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  He's got a mohawk.  I'm just cutting my hair.  Yeah, he's cutting his hair so he's shaved a mohawk.  Where's this one? 
[01:30:30]  This one's great.  The one right before it.  This is normal.  Hilarious.  Yeah, this is great.  Jim Norton on Twitter for the Vine videos.  Oh, where's the fucking volume?  Put it from the beginning.  You're fucking losing everything.  Hilarious.  Normal.  Hilarious.  Normal.  Hilarious.  Normal.  Hilarious.  Normal.  Hilarious.  His sunglasses are on, and then they're upside down for hilarious.  Normal.  Hilarious.  No. 
[01:31:00]  I love that the Chip finds it great.  The fucking home run after home run.  It's the perfect fucking...  What's this one?  Was this Florida?  It's the Ducks.  Yeah, it was in Jacksonville.  I didn't see this one yet.  Yeah, the fucking home run.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  The little ducks are out of pond.  Wah, wah.  And then he has...  He's having so much fun.  Yeah, the chip does have a good time.  Oh, I'm having a fucking ball.  Fine was made for chip. 
[01:31:30]  You see this is...  Eric.  Friday's.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Iraq fucked it up.  Piece of garbage.  I like sea salt.  How about D-E-N-F salt?  Not funny.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  I like sea salt.  How about D-E-N-F salt?  Not funny.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  Do you have a new masseuse story?  Someone's requesting you to tell it on the show. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know if you want to.  I don't know if I do.  Is it one of your bits?  It might have just been a bit idea.  Maybe they were in Jacksonville this weekend?  Did they hear it?  It was Jacksonville.  It was actually good.  I wish there was more people.  But the club, the Comedy Zone was great.  And the people that showed up were fucking really good.  Excellent.  Excellent.  Yo, Ben, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, buddy.  Maybe it was a bit, but one was the masseuse with cerebral palsy or whatever.  Oh, what's happened?  No, no, no.  I'll tell you what happened.  That wasn't a bit.  I was on stage and a girl was talking a lot. 
[01:32:30]  And so I said to her, she kept talking like I'm a masseuse.  But then she kept yapping.  I couldn't understand what she was saying.  I'm like, what?  What?  I know, sir.  I'm telling the story.  I was there.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What happened, Jimmy?  No, thank you, sir.  So I'm telling this.  I'm talking to this girl about massage.  I'm like, so you're a masseuse?  Because she kept piping up.  And I'm like, oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:33:00]  She doesn't speak very well.  She's drunk.  Oh, he thought she was drunk?  Yes.  And this guy, he just told the story the way.  Yeah.  But again, I wasn't going to tell it anyway.  And I'm like, so are you drinking?  And she's like, no.  She said something like, I got cerebral palsy.  Oh, fuck.  And so, of course, I went with it.  It was fun.  Because she was tackling but having fun.  She was totally cool.  I mean, she was drunk, too.  She was drunk with cerebral palsy.  And she was a masseuse. 
[01:33:30]  And so we played with her for a little bit.  It was a lot of fun.  Jafaka?  No, I didn't.  Jafaka?  She had a boyfriend with her who was cool.  But you could tell that she was a little high maintenance.  Just because she had been drinking.  And she leaned against me.  We took a picture together.  And I almost moved out of the way.  And she would have fallen over.  Oh, man.  But she was very nice.  Yeah.  But she was, yeah.  I kept fucking with her.  I'm like, what?  I don't understand you.  It happened like five times.  And people were shushing her because she kept piping up.  Oh, my God.  But, yeah, she had CP. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, that's a motherfucker.  I know.  But, you know, it wasn't uncomfortable because there was no way I could have, you know, known.  So it was.  That would have been.  You could have made it uncomfortable.  No, I didn't.  By being all like, hum.  I think I told her I liked it better when I thought you were drunk.  I think I said to her.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Yeah.  She was nice.  I have it filmed somewhere.  If it's anything interesting, I'll bring it to you.  Very cool.  All right.  And that guy fucking just calls up, hey, remember when you said the Jews walk into a bar and  they own it?  Tell that story.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:34:30]  He really did kind of cheese it.  We got a singer singing the Star Spangled Banner really, really badly.  What happened?  It was up there in Canada.  Oh.  At the National Junior Hockey Tournament.  Of course, it's a hockey thing.  Have you heard this yet?  No.  So this is one for the ages.  Is it a Canadian?  I would assume so.  Yeah.  Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light. 
[01:35:00]  First of all, I'm noticing, starting pretty high.  You've said this over the years.  It's a song you've got to start, oh, say.  You've got to start low, right?  It's all about the fucking beginning.  That Star Spangled Banner is a rollercoaster ride.  And it's all about where you start.  Because once you're on it, there's no fixing it.  You know?  So if you start up there, by the time you get to Rockets Red Glare, holy shit. 
[01:35:30]  You've got to get really high.  You best fucking be able to sing.  And you said this is a really tough song to sing in general, right?  Yeah, the range is huge.  So you've got to start low.  Oh, say can you see.  And then by the time, you know, you get to the high part.  Yeah, you're all right.  You wrote this song?  Ten bucks.  Anybody knows who wrote this song?  Francis Scott Keeney.  No, no, no.  Too late.  Oh, what happened?  Too late.  Too late.  What so roundly we hailed at the twilight's never scleap. 
[01:36:00]  Who's broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous night.  Oh, no.  Ramparts.  Ramparts.  Or them.  Or those ramparts.  Who's broad stripes and bright stars after dawn's early night. 
[01:36:30]  What are you doing?  She's falling apart.  What is she doing?  Oh, my God.  Have the words in front of you.  She obviously forgot the words.  Didn't Enrico Palazzo forget the words?  Who's that?  Fucking naked gun.  She forgot the words, so she's just going with the whole fucking cadence of the song. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Have we been in front of us?  There it is.  Everyone gets that part.  Oh, they're trying to help her.  Oh, wow. 
[01:37:30]  Boom!  She doesn't have a bad voice.  She just fucked that one up pretty badly, though.  I wonder what people said to her when she went back.  Yeah.  Hey, good job.  Yeah, you know, you stumbled a little bit. 
[01:38:00]  You picked yourself up.  After the game, Norm had issued this message on Twitter.  She said, I'm embarrassed and deeply sorry.  I wish I had more time to learn the American answer.  How about your whole life you had?  Cheat sheet, right?  Just read the words.  Oh, fuck.  Just read those words.  Oh, yeah.  Cheat sheet, you fucking cunt.  How bad is the devastation?  Coming up next.  Why are they doing the same shit we are, man?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Hey, that was pretty good there, Alexis.  You've done a good job over there.  You know, that stunk.  Yeah.  Poor girl. 
[01:38:30]  Is she getting followers on Twitter?  Oh, she says...  Well, no.  She only got 551 followers.  But she says, no doubt...  This is very much like the gay fucking shit newscaster guy.  Yes.  She writes, no doubt it's been a rough 24 hours.  Thanks to everyone who has sent supportive messages, I also empathize with the victims of cyberbullying.  That sounds like Miss Teen Delaware.  Same fucking thing, right?  Yep.  Didn't she fucking pretty much been a tough 24 hours?  Yeah.  Go with... 
[01:39:00]  What is AJ Clemente tweeting these days?  How is his...  How is his bartending gig?  Fuck that guy.  He wouldn't come on our show.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  You think Letterman or any of these other guys remember you at this point?  Of course not.  Third day.  New bar.  Back in Dewey.  Come into Cape Passa and celebrate Mother's Day with some tacos.  Holy shit, look at that.  He's at a taco bar. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  In Dewey.  All right, what else did he tweet?  What could they possibly be paying him for that gig?  So nice in Dewey today.  Summer's almost here.  Dewey.  Wants to be in Dewey.  Come hang with Dale and I at Dewey's new hot spot.  The table and tap room.  250 Sam Seasonal.  Wow.  Wow.  What was his last couple tweets, though?  I don't know.  Just go Rangers.  Go Rangers. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Rangers are having a tough time right now.  Yeah.  Just...  Yeah, what have they got?  Fucking...  Are they down two?  Yeah.  Two zip.  One week before Memorial Day weekend, come into Cape Passa for a drink on the beach and  maybe get on TV at Inside Edition.  That means Inside Edition is going down to film him.  They'll do like...  They'll just show like two seconds of video and comment on it. 
[01:40:30]  Remember this idiot?  Yeah, yeah.  This is what he's doing now.  But they'll have a nicer way to do it?  Yeah.  That's what we would say.  Of course we would.  We are.  Of course we are, yes.  What's that?  That's his mom.  His mom, yeah.  His supportive mom.  Oh, she's...  Must love having him back around the house living there.  Yeah, I'm so happy my son is home.  We get to spend time together.  Oh, it's wonderful.  You should be settling down.  I do settle down.  Mom, what a different drink every night.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  He's serving beverages.  Oh, boy.  Guess who almost just shat his pants? 
[01:41:00]  Wow, really?  Yeah.  I was about to force one out,  and something inside of me said,  you might not want to do that.  Oh, it's talking to you.  Yeah.  It is.  You had some weird food last night?  No, but I'm going to take the old skipper root of the toilet.  Go ahead there, Jim.  I'm going to take the very rare work shit.  Yes.  Oh, really?  I can sense it is going to be pure liquido.  Oh, you should record it on your phone.  If it's a good one.  You bet I will.  Yeah.  What the fuck? 
[01:41:30]  Get that echoey toilet sound and everything.  If you guys want to be in my Vine video,  I'll do a viral video.  Whatever one.  What the fuck?  Oh, boy.  I would like to be in one of the...  I think Chip's fine.  Chips are really going to take off.  They are great.  You want me to do one with you guys?  I'll get you guys a viral video.  Hold on a second.  What the fuck?  We'll do it in two seconds.  Get a couple million people watching.  A couple million.  I'm just going to show everybody.  Show the whole gang.  Look, just...  No, you got to smile.  That was my thing, though.  You got to call my appointment. 
[01:42:00]  It's Opie.  And Anthony.  Hi.  Jesus.  And Sam, too.  And I'm Chipper.  And I'm Chipper.  Fuck you, Sam.  That's all it is, huh?  See?  Fucking home run. 
[01:42:30]  That's a good one.  Upload that fucker right away.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  It's called Chipper introduces the gang.  Oh, that's a good title.  It's going to introduce the whole gang.  And there it is.  What the fuck?  From the volume up.  And Anthony.  And Sam, too.  And I'm Chipper.  Fuck you, Sam.  It's Opie.  And Anthony.  And Sam, too. 
[01:43:00]  And I'm Chipper.  Fuck you, Sam.  It's Opie.  And Anthony.  And Sam, too.  And I'm Chipper.  Fuck you, Sam.  It's Opie.  I had to save enough green to go,  Fuck you, Sam.  Yes, of course.  I'm watching my green go down.  Still not available for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  What?  They're dumb.  They should get right on the vine.  They got some heat right now, man.  The vine.  They're available for everybody. 
[01:43:30]  Exactly.  It's taking them so fucking long.  Fuckies.  Motherfuckies.  That just felt good.  It was nice.  I know.  I get so edgy with, like, dead air.  I like it, though.  All right.  Let's try.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's a dead air competition.  Ah!  We were doing good there. 
[01:44:00]  Hey!  You're a panicky pea.  Just let it happen.  It is panicky.  Hey, you know, Ron and Fez have a lot of, like, that.  Just, you know, Ronnie won't say anything for a while.  He collects his thoughts or something.  And then he'll just, you know, yeah, that's what I think.  They say something, you know?  Right.  That's not him collecting his thoughts, though.  No?  What is it?  He's hoping someone else would fucking maybe do some lifting.  Oh.  Well, that's pepper.  Give him a chance to just fucking breathe for a second.  All right.  You want to try?  You want to try?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:44:30]  Wait, doesn't the channel shut off if it's quite too long?  Fucking s-  Why are you laughing?  It's weird.  It's working, though.  He's a radio professional.  Why are you panicking?  All right.  We should see if we can get the channel to shut off.  What happens, though?  How do you turn it back on?  Let's find out.  We just call and turn it back on.  Yeah.  Does it actually turn off?  Well, it'll sense that there's dead air, and it'll just switch on to, like-  Backup? 
[01:45:00]  Just like, yeah.  Let's do it.  How long does it take to do that?  Not that long.  We just call down the hall and say, hey, we're having a silent game.  All right.  Let's try again.  You want to try?  Let's see if this works.  There's no way this works.  No way.  I'm saying it will never work.  It'll pick up the room noise, I think, right?  Yeah.  I think you guys have to be incredibly quiet.  All right.  Okay.  Well, I was doing really well.  Okay.  I'm not saying anything.  No laughing.  No nothing.  Ready?  There's the one that panics.  I'll be good.  Ready? 
[01:45:30]  Stop.  What are you doing?  I heard you snicker.  You might have to leave the room for this bit.  All right.  Give me one more chance.  If I ruin it again, I'll leave.  What is that about, though?  It's weird.  There's no noise.  It's the radio.  Yeah, but why do you feel like I have to-  Because I giggle.  He gets nervous.  He's nervous.  None of this means anything.  Who gives a fuck?  All right.  Let's try to turn it off.  All right.  Let's see if we can turn the station off. 
[01:46:00]  I still hear you, you idiot.  He's snickering.  I didn't make a sound that time.  And you're crying.  Why?  Because I couldn't make a sound.  I was laughing.  What's wrong with you?  Because he's fucking funny.  We don't get ratings anymore.  This doesn't matter.  I don't think we'd ever do this on a regular radio.  We need to do 30 seconds. 
[01:46:30]  Best few guys have sounded.  How do you know it's 30 seconds?  For some reason, I just remember that from back in the day.  Radio gold.  Let's go with 30 seconds.  All right.  Let's look at the clock.  All right.  It hits the two.  There's five seconds.  He can't see.  I want to do 30.  I was good at five.  It's 30 seconds.  All right. 
[01:47:00]  There's 10.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh.  Oh.  Sorry.  I thought I could get a.  That was you.  I thought I could get a round of Candy Crush.  That was Candy Crush making that noise. 
[01:47:30]  I thought I could get a quick one in.  You know what's really fucked up?  What?  I could hear the second hand on the clock.  No.  When it's silent.  Yes.  Listen very closely and watch the second hand.  And it goes.  I'm not kidding.  Watch.  Okay.  Quiet.  I do hear that.  You hear it?  Yeah.  It's going.  That's creepy.  It's fucked up.  We'll just go to break and we'll talk about creepy kids next. 
[01:48:00]  You know we're never going to make 30 seconds.  Huh?  Not with that attitude.  We should.  We got to get this channel turned off.  Dude.  You fucked it up so many times.  I'm not into it anymore.  You don't want to play Candy Crush?  I thought you could get a quick one in.  Turn this out of your phone off.  Actually, I still have to wait 2,500 minutes.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  You've banked that much time?  Yeah.  You're in debt that much time?  Yeah.  So now I'm going to have to pay the fucking 99 cents now to wash that back to zero. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Well, we.  All right.  Let's try it one more time.  If it doesn't work, we're going to break.  Okay.  Okay.  Ready?  Ignore the second hand.  Okay.  Shh.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  Noise.  We're still here. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, we're still here.  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:49:30]  We're still here.  Do you know how much the guys that run this channel hate dead air?  Oh, they fucking hate dead air.  That's their thing.  Why?  Well, it's the number one bad thing for radio.  Yeah.  Dead air.  Dead air.  Like, they don't even know what's on the channel.  But when do we have dead air that they hate it?  Like, if it's two seconds of dead air.  They go nuts.  Yeah.  Why was there seven seconds here?  Why did this happen?  Anyone else notice that when the second hand got to four, it really paused a little extra?  Really?  I might lose my fucking time. 
[01:50:00]  An extra long second?  It was like, I would call it a second and a half.  Come on.  It camped out on the four for just a little longer.  You didn't notice that?  No.  What's up, Mars?  It does kick off.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's picking up room noise or something, I think.  No, no, no.  You guys wouldn't sign it.  But DC, I think, picks it up.  And probably in DC, they're listening to you guys.  So they won't go ahead and put the...  Why?  You know.  Is there a human in the loop, you mean?  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Down in DC.  There's a person in the fucking...  We got to take the human element out of the loop.  It's a machine like war games.  Do you want me to call you CC and tell them that to you?  No, we don't care.  It's not that important.  We were just trying to kill them.  We're not going to purposefully, like, call them and have it work.  Right.  Then we could just shut the fucking mics off.  There, we did it.  But, I mean, you know, we were hoping it would just automatically.  Some machine.  Are you a fan of the hot pants that Taylor Swift was wearing last night?  She could wear something that looks much better than that.  I don't know why she wears those fucking tight... 
[01:51:00]  A lot of...  They're too high on her waist.  I don't like that look, do you?  Too low on her leg.  The high waist is very, very in.  I understand that, but I don't think it's flattering to a woman's body.  I want to see her thong sticking out of her.  But it's really in right now, huh?  Yeah.  Very in, yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  Because Low Cut was in before, so we've got to change it.  She's smoking.  But that means you don't have a chance of seeing the teaback.  Hey, you know, the chicks will be down at the beach party with their teabacks.  With their whale tail. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, God.  Rock hole.  Mm-hmm.  All right, we're going to talk about Creepy Kids next.  Something Ant brought up.  Yeah, I got to that.  It's so scary.  And we did save it, and we got it in front of us.  Ooh.  And, yeah, we'll do some other shit, too.  But first, this.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer. 
[01:52:00]  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that, 99 maybe.  And he goes, um, dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  Let's fucking hang out, and I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it, and some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books  and no books.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is it?  A guy from Saturday Night Live is going to send him back his books. 
[01:52:30]  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass.  For the minute, I get it.  For the minute, I get it.  He's like, dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  Get rid of the fuck.  It's ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with the fucking nap.  It's like, so I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  I said, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up, and the bags go 
[01:53:00]  all over, and he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking nap, sack, huh?  Are we hanging fucked in the nap, sack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting on my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I'm like, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer. 
[01:53:30]  What's up, baby?  You want to get some dirty talk going?  Yeah, that's it.  I'm going to give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm going to lay your back or something, and I'm going to lick all the way down your neck  like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like that.  I'm going to clean out your ears or something, and get wax on my tongue, and then lick all  the way down your neck.  Oh, that's a nice, dark nipple. 
[01:54:00]  I wouldn't mind getting some nook out of that.  And then I'm going to get my tongue, and I'm going to start flicking it all over your nipples  so much that you start cumming.  You're going to cum so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises.  I'm going to get down here and just start licking your fucking cooter really good.  I'll just, I'll open up your cooter.  I got, I got like long nails on my middle fingers, so I'll dig my nails into your cooter  lips, and I'll open them up, and I'll just go like, and I'll get in there until you cum 
[01:54:30]  so many times or whatever.  I'll stick it right in you, too.  I'll climb right up on you like you're a building or something.  I'm going to climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats in you.  Someone put a finger in my ass.  Now, now, back to our show.  You'll be the three show.  Now, back to our show.  Continues.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  You'll be the three show. 
[01:55:00]  Continue.  A rush.  Oh, yeah.  So, we got creepy kids.  Yeah.  It brought this to our attention, huh?  This got me all scared.  I was, uh, I was reading it online at night, and it was like, oh, man.  I couldn't imagine having one of those dumb fucking kids saying this shit.  Yeah.  It would petrify me.  Hey.  What?  What would petrify you if they said it was him in open court? 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  I have a sound effect for you.  Oh, you do?  I don't know how good it'll be.  It was very, very brief.  Okay.  I had a little bit of mud spraying.  All right.  A little mud.  Jim had to go to the bathroom.  Okay.  And, um, we have a little sound.  All right.  How do I play it?  Is it that sound you can only get from the toilet echoing?  Yeah.  I haven't heard it, so I don't know. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's disgusting.  That's the Hershey squirts, right?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  But that was all the noise it made, and the rest of it was actually fairly quiet.  I ate last night, I ate these fucking, these honey and thyme carrots, and all my little 
[01:56:30]  shits were, like, thin like that.  I think I just dutied out my honey thyme carrots.  What's honey thyme carrots?  Honey and thyme.  They had, like, spices on them or whatever.  Wait, you found carrots that have spices on them?  In a restaurant.  They got a gussy up them carrots.  Oh, yeah.  Carrots blow.  I like a good carrot.  Nah, I'll drink carrots and a vegetable juice, but fuck that.  I just wasn't sure if everybody heard it or not.  Ah, God. 
[01:57:00]  Damn, that is so disgusting.  Oh, that is squishy.  Oh, goodness, mate.  That was delightful.  Delightful.  I think not.  So creepy kids.  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's, um, apparently when you have these kids, they, uh, they walk around the house and, and they say creepy shit to you.  Right.  That would lead you to believe that there's some kind of ghostly things going on. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  In your house.  And, and then, you know, that's got to leave you all unsettled.  And then even, even, you know, days after that, you got to be thinking, oh, what the fuck?  What's walking around my house?  Some creepy ghoul.  So, um, they have a, uh, like a list of a few stories that these kids were saying to their, their parents.  A few things.  When, uh, when my youngest son was maybe two years old, he crept outside our bedroom door very early one morning while my husband and I were still asleep. 
[01:58:00]  I woke to a deadpan, tiny voice whispering, let her in, let her in, let her in over and over again.  Ooh.  Uh, and then she said, turns out the cat was pawing at the back door.  It was just informing us.  So that's not scary.  Right.  But, but the beginning of that.  Well, it's scary until you realize it was just a fucking cat.  Yeah, it's the cat.  Right.  But, but then there are times kids do this when it has nothing to do with the cat or anything. 
[01:58:30]  Right.  Um, uh, this guy was tucking in his two year old and he said, goodbye, dad.  And, uh, the father said, no, we say good night.  He said, I know, but this time it's goodbye.  Oh my God.  Like, how do you sleep that night?  No kidding.  You fucking sleep that night.  You dumb kid.  Yeah.  The fuck is that about?  Man.  While changing my daughter in front of the open closet door.  Dad, what's that video camera for? 
[01:59:00]  I said, we're making a movie.  Shut up.  You're going to be in a motion picture business.  Yeah, I'm going to be famous.  That's why I'm wearing a mask.  Yeah, they're in front of the closet door changing.  Uh, she kept looking around, uh, laughing.  Uh, I asked her what was so funny.  She said, the man.  To which I replied, what man?  And she pointed at the closet and said, the man with the snake neck. 
[01:59:30]  What?  I turned around and nothing was there.  I'm afraid to look into the history of the house to see if anyone hung themselves in the closet.  Oh my God.  The snake neck.  The man.  Like, what the fuck was she pointing at?  By the way, that's where I had to just put the fucking, I, I.  Oh really?  I went back to pornography on the computer.  It was like, cause then I'm looking around like, out windows, waiting to see little beady eyes.  He's looking into something.  Snake neck.  The man hung himself. 
[02:00:00]  How terrible.  Snake neck.  That's fucking scary.  Fuck yeah.  Um.  Eh.  This just sounds like a smart, smart ass, ass kid that, that learned something.  He said, I was on a bus recently and we stopped outside a walk-in clinic.  A little girl in a seat in front of me turned to her dad and said, death is the poor man's doctor.  Jesus.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Uh, I jokingly asked, uh, what's the best way to get a girlfriend? 
[02:00:30]  What?  The seven year old's response.  Tell her to be my girlfriend and she'll never see her parents again.  Or she'll never see her parents.  Or she'll never, and that's what I say.  She'll never see her parents again.  Um, before, oh yeah, this kid goes, before I was born here, I had a sister, right?  Her and my other mom are so old now.  They were okay when the car was on fire, but I sure wasn't. 
[02:01:00]  He was maybe five or six years old.  It was totally out of the blue.  What are the fucking, what is happening?  Well, now the phone's running.  It's scary.  We're going to get some fucking stories now.  Um, let me see, find another.  Uh, my five-year-old at the time had night terrors and would scream in her sleep.  One night I said, uh, mama's here.  It's okay. 
[02:01:30]  She looked right at me, still asleep, and screamed, mama, but who's that behind you?  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  The fuck needs that?  Who needs that?  Oh, God.  Um, uh, that one's just, some of them are just kids being, like, smartasses.  Sure.  Others are kind of scary.  Um, oh, man.  Walking through a graveyard to visit some departed family members. 
[02:02:00]  We're walking across the grave of a baby boy who died shortly after being born.  There's a family relationship, so we know for a fact the mother is still alive.  My four-year-old son turned to my wife and said, why is that baby crying?  Why won't his mom hug him?  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Just, why the fuck would you bother?  You gotta, you gotta choke the kid out at that point.  You can't fucking, uh, have him doing that. 
[02:02:30]  Um, my daughter said to me that there's a woman who watches, uh, her watch movies in  her room and sleeps on the ceiling above her bed when she sleeps.  Oh, my God.  She also says, it does not like me and wants to eat my heart.  My kid watches Elmo and fucking dinosaur train.  What the hell, where the hell did she get this from?  Oh, my God.  Sleeps on the ceiling.  Probably all curled up weirdly.  And then rolls across the ceiling and down the wall like they don't have gravity. 
[02:03:00]  What's gonna make this worse is real stories coming in now.  Yes, of course.  Let's say hi to Paul.  Hi.  It looks like Phil.  Phil in Jersey.  Phil.  Phil, Phil Connors.  Phil.  Yeah, I have a cousin who, uh, she was two years old and she used to sleep in a crib.  And, uh, they kept finding her outside of the crib every morning when they woke up.  So, my aunt asked her why she was, how she was getting out of the crib and she said,  the old man picks me up and dances with me. 
[02:03:30]  They asked the old lady that they rented the house from and apparently her husband died  and he used to carry her children around and sing and dance with them all the time.  Sure.  Wow, fuck.  Oh.  What is he?  What's the shit about?  That's fucking, like, creepy.  Uh, thank you, Phil.  Oh, man.  Let's say hi to Eric in D.C.  Yeah, um, I'm a soldier and I was, we lived in Germany and my three-year-old little boy,  we were in a German house and all of a sudden about three in the morning, my three-year-old 
[02:04:00]  screaming in his room, he's yelling, get it out, get it out.  We go in there and he's throwing every movie out and he points a jitty-jitty bang bang  and he says, get that movie out of here.  I don't want it here anymore.  He hadn't even watched that movie yet.  What the hell's that about?  Yeah, he just knew the movie sucked.  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, you, chitty-jitty bang bang.  Movie does suck.  Has anyone ever explained this shit?  Yeah, well, when the kid, like, has no means to learn shit like this, how do they come up 
[02:04:30]  with this stuff?  Well, when it matches up with some kind of history of the house, that's really fucked up.  Yeah.  Let's go to Andy in Boston.  Andy.  Boston Strong.  What's up, Andy?  Hey, a little suburb outside of Boston, Hopedale, Mass., a little mill town.  My wife's parents have lived in this old, old house for years and I've been with her for  11 years and they've told us time and time stories of this house just being fucked up.  So, my son's six now, when he was three, I was sitting right there when this all happened. 
[02:05:00]  He was sitting on his grandmother's lap and if he's in the living room, he can look into  the hallway and you see the stairs going upstairs, but you only see about five stairs  because the wall cuts it off.  So, he's sitting there, he's giggling uncontrollably and pointing at the stairs and it's just the  three of us there.  And we're laughing, we're like, this kid's goofy.  Then all of a sudden, he just goes stone cold white, puts his face in my in-laws' chest 
[02:05:30]  and just starts bawling.  Three years later, he hasn't let us bring him into that house.  So, I don't know.  I don't know, but he hasn't been able to step foot in his grandparents' house in three years.  Oh, did he see like some fucking creepy, scary shit?  Oh, man.  Holy fuck, man.  I don't want to do this bit.  I don't like that.  It's all fine and well now.  We take a home.  It's dark out at night time.  Let me say hi to Steven Rockland.  Steve.  What's up, fellas? 
[02:06:00]  Hey.  My now five-year-old, since we moved into our house about three years ago, has told us  there's a man living in the attic.  You don't, why would they do this?  You little fuckwats.  Make his room in the attic.  Yeah, yeah.  What makes it worse is shit randomly disappears and will appear like my money clip went missing  three years ago.  It showed up on my pillow two months ago.  Oh, what the...  Ooh. 
[02:06:30]  That could be your kid.  That's fucking...  Yeah, it's probably your kid's a thief.  No, I asked him.  I asked all of them.  I asked my mother-in-law and my mother and my wife.  Nope.  Barry Williams is Greg Brady lived in the attic.  That's right.  He's got his own room up there.  Maybe he was hiding the money clip.  He was keeping them by his cigarettes.  Oh, right.  The cigarettes.  Or by the goat.  The mascot goat.  Thank you.  Hiding those secrets that Dad had money.  Let's go to Janine in North Carolina. 
[02:07:00]  Janine.  Hello.  Hi.  Same thing.  I was changing my daughter.  She's probably about 14 months old.  And it was just after my husband's grandmother passed away.  And she's looking up in the corner of the room, kind of giggling and laughing.  And I look up.  And I'm like, what are you laughing at, Cookie?  She's like, Nana.  She goes, Nana?  She's seen her dead grandma?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck is this shit about?  And they can't, like, know, like, I'm going to freak my parents out.  Let me say some freaking shit. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  She was a baby.  Oh, shit.  All right.  We got a deputy.  Thank you, Janine.  Eric in Wisconsin is a deputy.  Eric.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got this kid I've been dealing with.  Been to his house a couple times now.  And every time I go out to his house, he comes out of his room.  And he tells me that there's an old man in there with a knife and a dog.  And he tells him every night that he killed mom and dad. 
[02:08:00]  And the last time I was there, he actually invited me into the closet.  It actually happened.  And I was like, fuck that.  I ain't going to no closet.  And he kept following me out into the room.  And this kid has a really bad, he can't understand what he's saying.  And he actually comes out of his room.  And he's real low voice, never heard anything like it.  And he's like, I'm the fucking devil.  Get your ass in this closet.  And day when I get a complaint out at that house after that, I will not go back to that house again. 
[02:08:30]  Cool kid.  How do you like that, Chip?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Kids can just freak their parents out like this.  Yeah, of course.  Let me say out of Ron and Indy.  Ron.  I knew better when I was a kid.  I would pull the shit out of my dad.  You would have got the upper hand.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You would have had the upper hand for once.  Ron, what's up?  My dad passed away about two weeks before my youngest daughter was born.  And when she turned three, I heard her playing in her bedroom. 
[02:09:00]  Went in there to see what she was doing.  And she said that she was just playing with some old guy.  And I thought she was just messing around.  You know, no one had ever told her about my dad.  Took her downstairs.  And we have a photo of him up on the mantel.  And she said, Daddy, that's the guy.  Can you ask him to come back to play with me?  Oh, boy.  Get the fuck out of here.  Whoa.  And what did you do?  I was just kind of speechless. 
[02:09:30]  It's one of those things you try to tell people.  How about you tell your dad to knock it off?  Yeah.  That's what I would do.  Yeah.  That was like the...  And I had dreams, and he scratched my penis, and then I felt better.  That's hilarious.  That's like the Twilight Zone episode where there was little Bill Moomey.  Little William Moomey.  And he was...  The grandma died.  And she was going to take the fucking kid.  Because she missed the little kid. 
[02:10:00]  So she was going to take the kid.  So she was always fucking around, making the kid almost drown in the fucking fountain and shit.  And she was going to kill him.  And the kid would talk on the little toy phone.  Oh, right.  And he'd giggle and go, oh, grandma, yeah, I'll see you soon, and stuff.  And then she was telling the kid how to, like, kill himself so she'd be with him.  And then at the end, the father was like, you know, the kid, he's drowned.  And they're trying to save him, save his life.  And the father gets on the little toy phone.  And he's like, Mom, please give him to us.  He's just a bad mother. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my.  And then he came back to life.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  That was really creepy.  They had to give you the Hollywood ending, huh?  Yeah, of course.  Even in that world.  They shouldn't have, right?  Rod Serling, you pussy.  He pussied out on that one.  Yeah, he should have.  I don't know if he wrote that one.  But, yeah, they should have just had the kid die.  And the mother go, like, fuck you, over the phone.  Eric in Florida.  Eric.  Yeah, morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, so I used to live in Kansas.  And it was kind of a creepy old house.  The attic was really weird looking.  I mean, it was an addition that was built on top of the house. 
[02:11:00]  But, anyways, my dog would go up there with no problem.  But the basement, he would not even step a foot on the first step there.  And, I mean, you could try everything you could to get him to go down there, and he wouldn't go.  But anybody else's basement, friend's house, and stuff, he had no problem.  Yeah, that's creepy when dogs know shit.  Animals.  I don't like when animals do that.  They just stare at something and nothing's there.  Like in The Sopranos.  Remember the cat was looking at fucking the Christopher picture?  Yeah, yeah.  And fucking Paulie Walnuts was all pissed. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  Yeah.  It's a snake with fur.  Well, we got a shitload of them.  We got my son said he saw a dead guy at the hospital.  Well, walking around the morgue.  He saw an alien.  Five-year-old.  All right, let's try this one.  Let's say hi to Steve in Connecticut.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  My five-year-old son has conversations with my father who died three years ago in his bedroom almost every night. 
[02:12:00]  Did you listen to him talk to him?  You can hear him talking to him, and you go in there, and you'll say, you know, Jason, who are you talking to?  And he'll go, oh, I was just talking to Pop.  He was in here.  And it's like, you just get freaked out.  What the fuck?  Come on.  How do you not just freak out every night?  And the best part about it is my father had his leg amputated, so he'll tell me, Pop has a new leg now.  Pop can walk.  Oh, come on.  That's like proof positive. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Right there.  Full of shit.  It's full of shit.  Your kid's a fucking liar.  It's right.  Let me say hi to Paul in New York.  Paul.  Hey.  How you guys doing?  This shit could be explained, right?  By somebody?  Go ahead, Paul.  Yeah.  My daughter, when she was three years old, she kept saying, I'm playing with my friend Gigi. 
[02:13:00]  I'm playing with my friend Gigi.  Oh, no.  Shoving bananas up his ass.  Throwing shit.  And fucking throwing shit at her other playmates.  Gigi's my wife's grandmother.  Oh.  And then she goes, oh, and she goes, and I was playing with my friend Johnny.  Johnny's my wife's brother, dead brother.  Jesus.  How were they in the mob? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  The whole family's fucking checking out.  Gigi, huh?  Wow.  Why do kids, like, want to play with these old fucking people?  Exactly.  Like, no one wants to play with old people.  Pop.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's try Ray in Baltimore.  Well, you doesn't have to call him Ray.  Fucking, there's way too many stories out there, though.  Ooh.  We're blowing off half of them.  Go ahead, Ray.  Yeah, I got a new house.  I live in North Carolina now.  My mother came to live with us before she passed, and she always liked playing with her 
[02:14:00]  granddaughter.  She always played with her.  She was, like, about almost two years old then.  And so after she dies, we cremated her like she wanted, and I don't know where to, I didn't  know where to put it, so I put her in the closet, and the closet doors are always closed.  And the girl's getting older.  She's about two and a half, and she's, like, always pointing in the closet and waving when  we're talking to her.  It's like, who are you waving at?  What are you doing?  It's grandma.  It's grandma.  I'm like, oh, my God.  That shit can fuck you up big time.  Well, does she know that the old bag is in the closet? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, somehow, kids do pick up on so much shit you don't realize.  Well, since that, I have married her, so we haven't heard anything more.  All right.  That's right.  It's his mother.  He's in the old bag.  What a fucking prick.  Holy shit. 
[02:15:00]  Does the kid know the old bag is in the closet?  Oh, Jimmy.  God damn, that's fucking, that's so bad to say about his loved one.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Oklahoma City.  Ryan.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, so my cousin, he's probably about two or three at the time, and his mom's giving 
[02:15:30]  him a bath, and he looks at her and says, I used to know grandma way before I knew you.  And she goes, well, what do you mean?  She used to visit me.  I guess he's referring to heaven.  And then he goes, well, I didn't want to come here, but they made me.  What?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  And what do you say?  Knock that shit off.  Right.  Put on SpongeBob. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Don't ever speak of this again.  Yeah, that's some creepy shit.  I couldn't imagine that.  It's bad enough.  You know, you go to sleep, and you read some shit, or watched a movie, and then you think  you're going to open your eyes, and some scary face is going to be one inch on your face.  Oh, Christ.  That's like my nightmare.  Oh, and the color of the face.  Oh, yeah.  You have to shit again?  Jimmy's running out.  He's got an apparition in his pants. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, wait.  He's going the other way.  Frankie.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up, Frankie?  About 10 years ago, my son kept saying, the man in the box is going to take me to a hockey  game, and he never fucking did.  What?  The man in the radio is going to take me to a hockey game.  He changed it.  And 10 years later, he's still haunting me with that shit.  All right.  We're just about done with this.  Oh, boys.  We got one more call coming in.  Hi, who's this? 
[02:17:00]  Hey, it's Chippa.  Oh.  Hi, Chippa.  Chippa, what?  You got a story?  Yeah, it's a good one.  I was in a car one time, and we're just driving along.  We was going back from, I had to go to Crouses to get some dip because I was having a party.  And so we're just driving.  We're just fucking driving, right?  Just rocking out, playing some sick fucking puppies.  And all of a sudden, we're stuck in traffic.  I'm like, what the fuck is this shit?  I'm cursing and screaming and getting through it. 
[02:17:30]  And there's this fucking, this kid next to me, and he goes, he goes, it was an accident up there.  Some lady got hit on a bicycle or some shit.  And I'm like, what the fuck, kid?  How do you know that shit?  Maybe she's okay, right?  And the kid goes, she's right behind you, Chippa.  That's from The Sixth Sense.  And the fucking lady is, the fucking lady is standing outside, her head's all fucked up.  That's a movie.  Chippa, that was from The Sixth Sense, the movie. 
[02:18:00]  They probably stole that shit.  I told that story one time.  Fucking tits were all out and shit.  She's like, go ahead, jiggle my big tits.  No, see, that wasn't from the movie.  They must have left that part out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm fucking Zooty.  Of course you were.  You were driving Zooty.  Yeah, we were fucked up.  I've seen another ghost, too.  Yeah?  Fuck, yeah.  I was, uh, one time, I would, uh, I was, I was in my house, right, and I heard this chick, 
[02:18:30]  so I'm like, well, let me check this out.  Maybe it's some pussy for the old Chippa.  And I'm like, what's up?  And the chick puking in a tent.  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing in here?  There's a tent, you're puking in it.  She's like, whatever, I'm just sick, Chippa.  That's from The Sixth Sense.  It's from the same movie?  It's the same fucking movie.  It's not a movie, it's fucking, what happened to me.  No, it's not.  Cock fucking.  All right, Chipp.  There goes Chipp.  Finally, Joe in Pennsylvania.  Joe! 
[02:19:00]  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey, buddy.  I was, uh, moving into a new house.  I was in Wisconsin at the time.  I'm in the Army.  And I set up the upstairs for my daughter to play in while I was moving furniture.  And about a couple hours later, she comes downstairs.  I go, hey, kiddo, how you doing upstairs?  She goes, good.  It's fun.  The dead people are fun to play with upstairs.  Oh.  Yeah, and I don't believe in that stuff at all.  And I asked them, like, what do you say?  She goes, yeah, the dead people come around, but it gets really, really cold when they're  up in the closet with me.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  And the entire time we lived there, um, she was dead set on saying, you know, that there  was dead people upstairs she was playing with, and the house creeped the hell out of me.  I couldn't keep a babysitter at night.  The house was really creepy.  Wow.  Thank you, Joe.  Thanks, man.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  The only one I got, my daughter, who's now seven months, when she was, like, three or four  months, she would just turn her head and look at my, I have a picture of my father. 
[02:20:00]  In my living room.  And would just stare and smile at just that.  We have a whole bunch of pictures.  Yeah.  But that's the only picture she would, she would focus on and get happy and smile.  Oh, man.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  But it, I mean, it creeps us, it used to creep us out.  She doesn't do it as much anymore.  I wonder if kids pick up on people's energy.  Like, when you're looking at that picture, maybe you get a good feeling, so maybe she picks  up on that.  Maybe kids are like dogs and that they unfiltered pick up on emotions or our own shit. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  I think there's more of a logical explanation than thinking that your kid's upstairs, you  know, fucking playing with dead people for real.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine?  Oh, man.  And then what happens?  That's, that's Sixth Sense or whatever you want to fucking call it.  What?  It just turns off someday.  Yeah.  I've never seen that movie.  I've never seen it.  A lot of people say that, like, you know, kids see dead people.  Yeah.  They swear by it.  So what, at what age does that just turn off?  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  You're now just like us idiots.  I guess when you get to that.  When you lose that special talent.  When you get to that point where you, where you'll remember things as a, you know, as an  adult, you'll remember back then.  Before that, it's just like, I don't know what happened.  Like, there are years of your life that you were just walking around like a, like a drunk  blackout from the time you were born until what?  Like four?  Four and a half?  Pretty much.  Which is weird because my, my kid's three and I, I, I, I assume we're making great memories  for the kid, but then I look at my own life. 
[02:21:30]  I'm like, my first memory, I think it's like kindergarten.  Like five.  Four or five.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no way I remember anything before that.  Two and three.  It's just a big blackout.  Right.  You're just like, I don't know.  They tell me I did this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break and Jesse Joyce is going to join the program.  Jimmy's at the Stress Factory this weekend.  Tickets got to be sold out or closed.  No, it's not, but it's selling well. 
[02:22:00]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Nice.  Four nights.  Wow.  Four nights.  Seven, three, two, five, four, five.  Ha ha.  You're camping out.  Yeah.  I haven't done the room in a couple of years, so I'm happy to be back.  Very good.  All right.  Jesse Joyce next.  New from Got It, Got It recordings and Egghead Records.  All the hottest Opie and Anthony sounds repackaged and approved by management.  It's now that's what I call Repurposed Volume 1.  Never before has all this repurposed radio audio been available in a single compilation. 
[02:22:30]  Hear what happens when a comedian telling a story about a simple trip becomes a war hero.  Every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  The Comedians Don't Stop with Rich Voss and the conversation about technology that turns  into a little something else.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  You hook it up.  Okay.  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage? 
[02:23:00]  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Hey, was Sam talking about circumcision or docking?  Sam, what made you even want to get into docking in the first place?  For whatever reason, I wasn't circumcised, obviously, when I was born.  Now That's What I Call Repurposed brings you the racist rant turned into a country-sweeping  song.  Calling for me, hey.  Tell it to me, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Calling for me, hey.  And we really get meta with Repurposed.  Purposed is sounding weird now. 
[02:23:30]  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  We've got to keep pumping them out or they won't leave us alone.  It's Now That's What I Call Repurposed, Volume 1.  Available now from Got It Got It Recordings and Egghead Records.  Where are you?  Why are you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Where are you?  Why are you with me?  Because I need you to notice me. 
[02:24:00]  I remember when I met you.  You'll notice me.  Hurting me.  Painting me.  Say.  Say about me.  Where are you?  Why are you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Where are you?  Why are you with me? 
[02:24:30]  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  Where are you?  Where are you?  Why are you with me? 
[02:25:00]  Because I need you to notice me.  Serious.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  You see the STP thing?  They got a good old, what, Chester?  From Linkin Park as the new lead singer? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  And people are asking me, what do I think?  I don't like it.  No?  I like STP with Scott Weiland, period.  It's got to be called a different band.  Thank you.  At that point, you just fucking go, all right, these guys, the DeLeo brothers are talented,  Chester's looking for something a little different, let's come up with a new project.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  They don't want to go through all the time and effort of getting a new brand, a new name,  a new band out there, so it's just like, ah, yeah, it's STP.  But Scott Weiland is STP with that distinct voice in his. 
[02:26:00]  Is there a clip out there, Travis?  I heard there was a...  I don't...  This was the K-Rock thing in L.A., right?  Yeah, someone said there's a...  So were they playing Stonehenge Pilot songs?  Supposedly, that's what I heard.  And Scott Weiland is on tour playing the same song.  Yeah, yeah, because the band...  There's two bands.  Yeah, they hate each other.  They've always hated each other.  They were able to keep it together for a couple years recently, and that was it.  I saw an article over the...  Huh?  I saw an article about this over the weekend.  I haven't seen a video, though.  Wait, is this him? 
[02:26:30]  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  You know why I grew up singing all this shit anyway, right? Like everyone can sing STP 
[02:27:00]  Sounds pretty good  There's just something about Weiland, though, that something very distinctive in his voice that that guy doesn't have. Like, everyone can sing STP, but that's pretty close, though. It is pretty good. Do they get together just for a quick thing, or are they trying to do something with this? I'm wondering if they were booked for this already, and they were like, you know what, let's just do something. Thank you very much. Yeah, because Chester's still doing it with Lincoln Park. 
[02:27:30]  You know what, I'm all right with this. It seems like it's a quick, maybe one and done, or a couple shows here and there.  I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed. 
[02:28:00]  I don't think he's got the Weiland range. It's not bad, though. Oh, you know what? They recorded a song together. Oh, they did? Yeah. I think this is kind of like a side project, though.  I'm not the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed. 
[02:28:30]  There's a lot of people. There's a lot of people in the news today that are just giving fuck yous left and right. There's another Donald Trump pendulum situation. The DeLeo brothers are like, yeah, really? You're going to go fucking do it without us? Well, fuck you.  Fuck you.  No, fuck you.  I love this song that way.  If anyone cares. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, there's a good one.  I love Dead and Bloated. All right, we've got to get Jesse Joyce in here.  Ooh, yeah.  What's he got cooking?  We're going to find out. Jesse Joyce entering the studio.  Pull up a chair.  What's up, brother?  Take a seat.  How you been, man?  I'm good, man. How's things?  That looks like the backdrop of Caroline's.  It is adorable. Yeah, I got it from home.  It's a nice little coffee cup.  Thanks.  We're watching, like, some Stone Temple Pilots with the Linkin Park guy. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, okay. Right?  Yeah, he joins Stone Temple Pilots.  That's TP. You know what, though?  For a show.  But now we're finding out that he also recorded a new song with the guys.  Is it the screaming guy or the rapping guy?  From Linkin Park.  I think it's Screamy Guy.  Yeah, Screamy Guy.  All right, Chester.  Screamy Guy.  Chester, Bennington, I think, right?  Yeah, the rapping guy and Screamy Guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been to a lot of strip clubs.  I'm familiar with their music.  Exactly.  Do they play them a lot in strip clubs?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I figure.  Yeah, it's like that and Kid Rock, you know. 
[02:30:00]  It's pretty much.  Yeah, yeah.  Strip club staples.  Nowadays, used to be like fucking, you know.  Molly Crew was huge.  Yeah.  Huge in the clubs.  All the 80s.  Fucking 80s, man.  And the dance, I just loved.  I never understood their criteria for rejecting a song.  Right.  Like, it's like Dr. Feel Good, and they're dancing around to it, and then fucking, you  know, it comes on, and then some other metal song comes on.  Could you just, could you eject this one? 
[02:30:30]  They cover their tits up for that five seconds that they're being human.  Yeah.  Could you, could you eject this one?  Bobby?  Bobby ejected it.  Thank you.  You've been to some unprofessional strip clubs, my friend.  Oh, it's Long Island, dude.  Right.  Long Island.  Long Island.  Why do they have to cover up, though?  I don't know.  They would, like, cover up and be like, um, yeah, we, we.  And then they'd put, you know, another song on and just shove a beer ball in.  Probably means she was hit to that one.  The fucking, the crank addict she's dating probably belted her to that song. 
[02:31:00]  Turn off, kickstart my heart.  She's just twitching.  I dated a stripper once, like, a long time ago.  And it's interesting how dull.  How'd that work out for you?  Yeah, fine.  Whatever.  I was a drunk at the time.  It's not right.  You fucker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You fucker.  Where the shit comes out.  It's amazing how quickly strip club bitching on the, like, you know, when you have to talk  about the mechanics of the job, how, like, dumb office politics it becomes, you know?  It's just like, cinnamon took my song. 
[02:31:30]  Like, that's literally, like, a conversation I had to have once.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they're always bitching about the owner of the venue and how fucking, you know,  shitty they're treated.  Right.  How they didn't get the fucking prized, you know, Friday night fucking spot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're real catty and competitive about the slots and whatever.  I never thought that when I was just tossing back fucking $12 Budweiser's watching your  sorry ass.  Did you guys ever go to a strip club in Western Canada?  They do an interesting thing because, you know, they have coinage.  They don't have, like, the dollar.  They're, you know, like, the smallest bills of five, you're not going to fucking give 
[02:32:00]  a stripper a $5, you know what I mean?  Right.  So there's the dollar and $2 coins.  Yeah.  And so what happens is, like, you end up, like, what they do is they come out and they  put a magnet on their twat, right?  And you go, like, fling, like a pirate.  You're just flicking coins.  Get out of here.  And if you get one to stick, you get to keep the magnet.  That's like the little.  Oh, my God.  Who wants the magnet?  There's a fucking stink box on the back.  Well, I think that's part of the appeal of it.  Like, that's why dudes like to get it rubbed on their head and whatever.  I don't want the magnet, though. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  At the condo, at the comedy club, it's filled with those magnets.  And, like, do you know how hard, like, like, you could be there all night and not successfully  get it to stick on the magnet, you know?  So, like, the number of man hours that are invested in filling a refrigerator with those  twat magnets, like, that is an impressive amount of time the comedians have spent there.  What kind of magnet is it, though?  It's, like, got her shitty picture.  It's, like, one of those ones you get at, like, a car dealership or whatever, just, like,  a square or, like, a little.  And it's got her picture on the front and then the magnets on the back.  But then the awkward thing is, at the end, they have to collect the money, you know? 
[02:33:00]  So they pull out, like, a little metal detector thing, and they just go, like, walking around  the stage nude like a grandfather.  Just click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  It, like, really takes you out of it.  Like, it's not sexy at all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's pretty entertaining.  Oh, man.  Yeah, there were plenty of things that just took you out of it for the moment.  When they'd get into, like, like, yelling matches with the bartender, it's, like, just  fucking dance.  Yeah.  Oh, and when they, you know, they were just fucking shaking down some poor old sap at 
[02:33:30]  the corner of the bar.  Right.  Like, just crawl over to, and you see them just keep coming back.  And then the other dancers notice they smell the blood in the water.  Right.  There's just a stripper feeding frenzy of this poor guy who's just doling out his fucking  social security check.  Oh, yeah, I got, like, I've been to a lot in my day, you know, and I pretty much know  the etiquette, and I know the whole gag is they're supposed to pretend to like you, and  that's what's awesome about it, right?  Right.  But I totally, when I was, like, 25, it was, like, I actually had a lot of money at that  moment in my life, because I was writing for a thing.  Yeah, yeah.  And I've never been so, like, hosed by a stripper in my life. 
[02:34:00]  Like, it was amazing, because I even knew the deal, but she, like, played me perfectly,  because, like, my attitude, especially as, like, a 25-year-old and I'm a comedian or whatever,  like, I'd go in a strip club and go, like, I'm not like the rest of these  serial killers, you know?  And so she...  And that alone puts you in a vulnerable position.  Yeah, because she came up to me...  Because you're thinking you're better than them, so she treats you like you are better  than them, and you're like, look, I'm fucking...  See, I knew I was better than them.  Yeah, all these assholes think...  That's exactly...  But she really does like me.  She totally came right up to me, and she was like, you're not like the rest of these 
[02:34:30]  serial killers, and I was like, I know, I'm not.  Exactly.  She spent the whole time hanging out with me, and, like, and it was like, when it happened,  when I realized I got taken, it was like the end of Usual Suspects, you know what I mean?  Like, I dropped my Jack and Coke and slowly replayed the whole evening where I gave her  $700, she gave you $700?  I gave her $700 over the course of the night, but, like, yeah, and so, but it was so fast  how she played it, because it was like she wanted to go out, she's like, you know, let's  hang out afterwards, and I was like, yeah, let's totally hang out. 
[02:35:00]  Hey, look at this, I'm fucking gonna be taking a stripper.  And right at the moment where, like, I was about to get her number, coincidentally, every  time the song would end, like, she had this, like, brilliant mathematical timing where  she knew how long every song was that she danced to, and so it was like, right then,  the song, and she would go, like, listen, I'll get your number in a little bit, like,  we'll totally do, but I gotta go out and make some more money, and I was like, no, no, you're  staying here with me, and then she'd change the subject, and then, like, I never, it was  brilliant, and then at the end of the night, she's like, do me a favor and go out, she  was like, I need your number so we can hang out, and I was like, great, and she's, and 
[02:35:30]  I don't have a pen, she's like, go out to the bar, so I'm like, okay, so I go out  to the bar, and then they, like, close the strip, like, all the lights come up, you  know what I mean?  And so now I go to the bartender, and I'm like, I need, do you have a pen, because  this stripper wants my number, you know what I mean, or whatever, it was just, and, uh,  no, he's probably like, yeah, yeah, yeah, and he's like, here you go, buddy, right, and  so I, like, write down, like, all of my contact info, and then I go over, yeah, yeah, yeah,  yeah, yeah, and I go back over, and now there's, like, a bouncer there, and I'm like,  oh, can I get back, and then here's the worst part, she told me her real name, you 
[02:36:00]  know what I mean, because, like, that's how, that's code for, like, you're in, you  know what I mean, they don't, they reveal what their real name is, and she said it was,  like, Jennifer, or something, you know, so I was like, uh, I was like, hey, uh, I know  that, I bet you hear this a lot, like, as it's coming out of my mouth, I'm like, oh,  I'm fucking such a douche, and I'm like, I know you've heard this all the time, but,  like, really, she asked for my, no, can you just make sure that Jennifer gets this, and  he goes, which one is Jennifer?  Like, she gave me a fake real name, and I was like, oh, she's fucking brilliant, you have  to just kind of slow clap it, because it was really impressive.  How embarrassing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so, $700. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, $700, yeah.  Did she call you?  No, I didn't, I never even got her, the bartender, yeah, the fucking bouncer did.  Yeah, hey, how you doing, man?  You know, you gave me your number.  Yeah, thanks for giving me both of your email addresses, also, just in case, in the Poconos.  Did you go back the next night?  No, no, no, no, no, because, like, I knew, I, but I was, I don't regret, like, God bless  her, she totally earned that $700, and that was when I was, like, 25, like, I could have  used that $700.  Sometimes the money is worth the, you're hanging out, and you're 
[02:37:00]  almost having this stripper girlfriend experience for the night.  She's with you.  Right.  You know, at the bar, you're chatting it up, you're fucking drinking, you're able to put  your hand on a leg and shit, and treat her like that, and then, you know, you're paying  her money, and then you just leave.  It's like a fucking, a prude prostitute.  Right.  If you come at the end, it's worth it.  Well, you're not going to come at the end.  You're coming at the end at home.  Yeah.  By yourself.  Jack off.  I mean, you're so down the, you're so down the fucking pervert rabbit hole, I don't know, 
[02:37:30]  like, have you ever, you ever just gotten a lap dance?  Oh, yeah, I remember, I've come in my pants twice during lap dance.  Okay.  Teehee.  They're wonderful experiences, to blow a load in your pants is fucking fantastic.  I think, from an etiquette standpoint, that you're not supposed to do that.  I know you're not, but I wore silk boxers, and I fucking shit in advance.  Of course I did, and she was rocking those, that ass crack on my dick.  Rhythmically, like, she was jerking me off, and this was in New Orleans, and she's trying  to get me to go into the back room for more money, and, like, I knew the champagne room 
[02:38:00]  was a bust, and I had given her, like, three or four lap dances.  I'm like, oh, maybe I'll go.  What will happen back then?  I'm just trying to keep that ass cheeks, uh, uh, uh, uh, and all of a sudden, fuck.  Oh, my fucking pants.  And I was working with Pete Correale and Louis Ramey, and I walked outside, and they're  like, how was it?  I'm like, look at this, and I showed them a fucking load.  You had a big shiz stain on your...  Gigantic.  Holy shit.  They were disgusting.  As well they should be. 
[02:38:30]  It was wonderful.  It was really wonderful.  Right.  I got thrown out of a tranny surf club once.  I walked in in New Orleans just to see what it was like.  It was on that same trip, and, uh, I'm like, I just walked right in, and the girl  wanted this big brute chick, wanted to give me a lap dance.  I'm like, no, I don't want one.  She goes, oh, okay, honey.  And she took my arm and walked me right back out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was funny.  Yeah.  Kicked me out.  I went to one in South Dakota once where, uh, it's like, it's just like a bar, but it  says it's a strip club.  It's like the only place in town, you know?  And, and I go in, and, uh, this lady, just a lady comes up to me in, like, a flannel 
[02:39:00]  shirt, and she's like, you want a lap dance?  And I was like, well, yeah, whenever one of the strippers comes around, yeah, if you  want to...  If you'd like to inform one of them that I'm here, yeah, that's fine.  And she was like, no, no, no, like, that's me.  And I was like, what?  And she was like, it's five dollars.  And so I was like, all right, well, that's worth it for the five dollars, like, just to  see what happens.  And she pulls out a fucking boom box, like, there's no, she just hits play on the tape  deck on a boom box, and then just takes off her flannel shirt, like, not even, not even, 
[02:39:30]  like, trying to, just, like, removing her shirt, like, she's getting a mammogram.  Like, that's the experience is really amazing.  Was it all right, though?  What did it look like under the flannel?  It was like, I, this is the, I, it's all come full circle now.  I literally gave her that five dollars, because I was like, someday, I'm going to be able  to tell that story somewhere.  So, now, that's the whole reason that I did it.  Yeah, yeah, that's where the strip club, like, the going to strip clubs all panned out in  the end, because, yeah, you come on the radio, and you just, yeah, you got a bunch of them.  There's an amazing one. 
[02:40:00]  Last time I was here was right before I went to Anchorage, and there's a great strip club.  Oh, dude, the, like, I did the worst thing I've ever done on a stage in Anchorage, and  I feel like a piece of shit for this, but.  Turn the mic on.  I totally walked in.  That's great.  Thank you for doing that.  That's amazing.  Yay, Jimmy.  Something was brewing.  I know.  I was like, yeah.  I thought, yeah.  Anyway, so, last time, one of the times I was there, I told you guys I went to this, 
[02:40:30]  like, crazy old guy is this wolf farm, and he rescues wolves or whatever.  Yes.  So, I'm friends with the radio guy who's there in town, and he and I had plans to go to that  thing, and at the last minute, he bails on me.  This is like six years ago, and he goes, but my son's going to come with you, who's  like 19, you know, and I was like, well, I don't need the company.  I wanted to hang out with him.  Oh, man.  So, it's like, all right, fuck.  So, like, now I've got to, like, babysit this 19-year-old, you know, and he was fine,  but he was like a really awkward, you know, like, kind of like maybe what Roland was like 
[02:41:00]  in high school.  You know what I mean?  Just this, like, you know, like, hey, how's it going?  You know, like, just quiet dude or whatever, you know what I mean?  Oh, you shouldn't have to deal with that.  Figures always smell like Similac for some reason.  Roland.  So, anyway, do we get to deal with the fact that I said what Roland was like in high school?  No, no, no.  That's okay.  No, I'm like, I'm like, I don't know, why would you have to deal with that?  Like, like...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How?  Roland knows what he was like in high school.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, anyway, so he's like, he's just, like, quiet and whatever, and I'm just, like, dragging 
[02:41:30]  out, like, what's, how's school going, buddy?  You know what I mean?  It's like an hour and a half trip, and I buy him lunch, whatever.  So, that's six years ago.  I forgot all about this dude.  Fucking, just recently, when I was up there, like, two months ago, I go, this dude comes  up to me.  He's like 20, whatever, five, six.  This guy, he's like a pretty normal, and he's like, hey, I just want to tell you, I'm the  kid that you took to, I just want to say thanks for being cool to me when I was, like,  a weird, awkward kid.  And I was like, oh, hey, that's cool.  And he's, like, excited to tell me he's, like, a grown-up now, you know what I mean?  He's like, I graduated from college. 
[02:42:00]  He's a grown-up.  Whatever.  Like, the show's about to start, so it's kind of getting loud.  And so, we're talking, and he goes, yeah, yeah, things are going great.  I've got a job now.  And he's like, and I got engaged.  That's her right over there.  And he points to her.  Oh, no.  And he goes, and that's her dad.  And he points to her dad.  He's like, he just came into town today.  And I was like, oh, thanks for bringing him to the show.  It's really cool.  And then the show starts, so, like, I've got to go.  So, anyway, I'm on stage, and I just got divorced this past year.  So, I have, like, a chunk about being divorced, you know?  Uh-huh.  And I want to have, like, a married couple in the front to kind of, like, pull out. 
[02:42:30]  You know, like, I just fuck with them, with the married couple.  But there's no, it's a new joke because I got divorced recently.  So, I've never experienced there not being a married couple.  So, there's just nobody.  So, I'm like, fuck, what do I?  And, I mean, I could do the joke, but I'd rather have somebody to play off of.  So, I go, well, kid, in the back, Jimmy, you just got engaged, right?  To him, silence.  Like, I don't hear anything at all.  And I can see him, right?  And I'm like, come on, don't leave me hanging, right?  Like, and it's just weird. 
[02:43:00]  So, I just move on with the joke.  Afterwards, he comes up to me, and he goes, I haven't asked her yet.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  He goes, I told you I was getting engaged.  I thought he said that he got engaged.  So, I fucking blew up the proposal in front of her.  And, wait, it's worse.  The dad, remember how he said the dad came into town?  He flew the dad in to ask his permission.  Oh, fuck.  So, in front of the fucking future father-in-law, I just fucking outed.  I'm like, come on, you just told me minutes ago. 
[02:43:30]  You got to get it.  Oh, no.  It's the fucking worst thing.  Wow, you fucked that up.  Oh, dude.  Damn.  I've never felt like more of a piece of shit.  Was he mad at you, or did he understand?  No, he was, like, shell-shocked.  Like, he didn't know what to do next.  He was like, dude, what?  He was like, what?  Yeah, yeah.  What did we do?  Like, that's kind of, so then I'm, like, in damage control mode.  Like, how do we fix this?  Like, I don't know what to do.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oops.  That's a oops.  Wow.  I flew the dad in to ask his permission.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, from, like, far away.  From, like, Florida or something. 
[02:44:00]  To Alaska.  Well, to your defense, why the fuck would you tell the guy that's going up on stage without  saying, you know, don't say anything either.  It's a secret.  I guess.  But still, it's unacceptable that I did that.  Well, yeah.  If you say to a person, like, because he thought it was pretty clear, I'm getting engaged.  Uh-huh.  But it was loud, and I heard I got engaged, and then he points to him.  Wow.  Yeah, you were half listening because he was an annoying audience member.  Exactly.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  How long were you in Alaska?  Just for the gig.  It's still weak, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  It's cool, though.  It's a crazy place.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a great strip.  The reason I brought it up, there's an amazing strip club there called the Alaskan Bush Company,  and one of those strippers, it was like an MSNBC documentary.  She, like, murdered a couple dudes.  Whoa.  Or she got them to murder each other.  She was, like, this black widow chick.  Wow, that's pretty talented.  She's pretty hot.  Her name's Michelle Manahan.  Look her up.  Does she still dance?  No, no, no.  She's in jail now.  Why?  Like, she got away for, like, 10 years.  She just escaped.  Like, she got these guys to kill each other for the insurance money on her behalf.  She took the insurance money and, like, bailed.  To Alaska.  And then, like, became a... 
[02:45:00]  No, that was in Alaska.  She bailed to, like, New Orleans or something.  Because a lot of people go to Alaska.  What a genius.  Yeah.  To hide.  That's a good one.  And then she ended up, like, being, like, a soccer mom when they caught her.  Like, she had, like, two kids and whatever.  So, let's pretty fast name.  What's her name?  Michelle what?  Lanahan?  We used to look her up to say, I want to see what this girl looks like.  I kind of remember this story.  And women can get you to do anything.  Just do a Michelle stripper.  Yeah, there you go.  She had her own life going.  And they caught up to her.  Oh, she had a pretty face.  Yeah, well, she was hotter, too, when she was back in the stripper days.  I would gather.  Oh, yeah, I remember her.  Yeah, you remember her?  Yeah, of course I did.  Oh, there's that picture, right. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How much time is she doing?  A lot.  Oh, yeah.  How'd she get them to do it?  I don't really remember exactly the details.  But, you know, they're sad Alaskans.  Yeah, and she fell in love with them.  You know what I mean?  They could make them do anything, I'm sure.  What an awful person.  Yeah.  What an awful person.  That story, when you're talking about the 19-year-old, and then you grew up, and he's like a man.  I was thinking how awful that's got to be for, like, a child molester that goes after young boys. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, when they grew up?  And then it's like, then there's that man, and, you know, you fucked him.  Yeah, you remember me?  You got to be like, oh, no, he's going to kick my ass now.  I don't even tell anybody what I did.  So are you, in a way, saying, like, hey, it's a good thing you didn't fuck that guy.  It's a good thing you didn't fuck him on that trip.  Good thing you didn't make him jerk you off while you were looking at wolves.  Imagine if he had masturbated you into the wolf feed.  That would have been amazing. 
[02:46:30]  Dogs certainly seem to like ejaculate, so I imagine that translates to their cousins.  Fuckers will eat anything.  Where are you going to be, Jesse?  I'm at the Comedy Club of Jacksonville this weekend.  We just came back from Jacksonville.  No, but I didn't do that.  I did the Zone.  Comedy Club.  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.  And then I'm doing the Carolina Comedy Club in Myrtle Beach the week after.  Nice, very good.  And those are two totally non-offensive names for comedy clubs.  They're just the comedy club of whatever. 
[02:47:00]  At least they're not trying.  Yeah.  Which is good and bad.  Well, you know, I don't know if you guys know.  Some of these club names are rough.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I used to tour with Geraldo.  I don't know if you knew that, like, for a long time.  Of course we do.  And so the go-to club name that we would always just like, hey, where are we working on this?  He would just go, shit stains was the name of the club, right?  And I'd just go like, oh, we're going to shit stains Thursday through Saturday or whatever.  And so we had the same manager, this great story, that some college chick who ran some newspaper, like, some bullshit college, she was, like, fact-checking an interview she'd just done with Greg. 
[02:47:30]  She called the manager all flustered, like, two hours after the interview going, like, hey, can you, I can't find, can you find, I've been looking everywhere, can you give me an address for shit stains?  Like, I've been Googling it for two hours.  Like, can you imagine what the fuck she was actually Googling for the last two hours?  You didn't just put her on the internet and have her find shit stains?  Pictures of this radio show coming up.  Why did I just Google Geraldo? 
[02:48:00]  You should have Googled him.  It's pretty great.  His club would have come up.  Stupid bitch.  Stupid bitch.  The winner in the Powerball still hasn't come forward, huh?  That's an amazing story right there.  I'm just looking at the tape, hey.  One fucking ticket, huh?  One ticket in Florida.  What part of Florida had it?  By Jacksonville, actually.  No, no, no, by Tampa, I'm sorry.  Zephyrillis.  Zephyrillis, yeah.  Where's that?  Outside Tampa, obviously.  It's like, like, a small 30,000 people live there.  Some small place for 3,000 people. 
[02:48:30]  You know, it would have went up to a billion, excuse me, a billion if no one won.  Could you imagine?  Do you know how you'll know if I ever win?  If I ever walk into work with my dick out, you'll know I've won the Powerball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just my cock out.  Something tells me other things could make you do that.  Then you realize I have the wrong number.  Yeah, that doesn't seem like the only circumstance under which Jim would walk in with his dick out.  Billion dollars.  Yeah.  It would have been.  It would have went up.  We're estimating it would have been over a billion. 
[02:49:00]  Now, if, like, did that person pick those numbers, or was it one of those instant tickets?  They usually say quick pick is the best way to go.  Because I'm thinking, I'm thinking, you've got to pick your numbers, obviously, because  it'll drive you nuts if they do come in.  Yeah.  But they say, most of the time, it's a quick pick.  Now, because the numbers didn't show up at the place where I would have bought it, you  know, in New York.  Right.  Does that mean that even if I played, there's no chance in hell I would have won?  Like, did the guy that came in, like, right after I would have come in, did he get my 
[02:49:30]  numbers?  Oh, good point.  Yeah.  Like, is it, or is the random fucking randomness of the numbers changing every split second?  It's got to be random.  So that, like.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  So, like, it's not like that store was destined to have the random numbers.  Yeah.  Or, or, or does it mean because the store I would have bought the tickets in didn't have  the winning ticket that I never would have been able to win, even if I had bought the  Oh, meaning you would have been in the Florida area to get the ticket. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  No, okay.  At that store, at the very store that sold it.  Or, or could you have had the numbers?  Or could I have had the numbers here if I did play because with the random numbers come  up?  Even more importantly, how cool would it be to get a hold of the person that was, like,  a split second from having the actual numbers, but they were, like, you know, this close.  And then you go up.  How do you live with that?  Well, it would be great to call them out.  Hey, that's all.  And tell them how close they really were.  Check the paper tomorrow, whoever committed suicide in fucking Zephyrsville or whatever 
[02:50:30]  it is, that's them.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  I wondered that.  Do you have to be in that actual store or that number would have came up anywhere, but  it just happened to come up at that exact moment.  Makes me feel better that I didn't play because no one won from the store that I buy it in.  It's a very complicated algorithm.  Dude, we will get 20 different answers.  No, dude, my uncle built the machines, and it's totally random with every second.  Like, so if you come in two seconds later, it's totally different numbers than the guy 
[02:51:00]  that would have come in after you.  All right.  That guy's full of shit.  The last caller.  See, because the numbers.  All right.  Wouldn't it be completely random, though, since there's always like, oh, six people have  this number all across the country, you know?  Like, you always get those cases.  It is completely random, but I'm just saying, like, all right, if me and some other dude  were in line, right, we're both going to get five quick picks, and then we switch places 
[02:51:30]  in line.  Now, I got his numbers, and he got my numbers.  Or is it, like, if I wait and go, all right, I'm going to wait one, two, three, four, five.  There, I waited five seconds.  Now give me my numbers.  Are they completely different numbers because I waited five seconds regardless of, you know?  They have to be.  Yeah, I think so.  You think they're constantly going, woo, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, here they  are.  I think so.  You know, like when they, I don't know.  I have no idea.  I want to know how many tickets this guy bought and how long he's been playing.  Like, does it work when people buy $300 worth every week? 
[02:52:00]  Or is it just the guy who walks in and just says, fuck it?  He's bought $700 million in tickets.  Yeah.  I didn't really read the article, but wasn't there a story about some dude who won it twice  just the other day?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's happened a couple times.  Not with something this big, but, yeah.  Was it random numbers you won with, though?  I guess so.  Yeah.  My grandma had, like, a crazy lottery habit, and, like, it was at least, like, $150 a week,  I think, is what she was dropping.  Like, never.  And if she did, it was, like, $2,000 or something, you know what I mean? 
[02:52:30]  So it was, like, totally not worth it.  So my dad somehow was able to convince her to, like, just literally throw it into a coffee  can, and then once every two months she would win the lottery.  Like, he would draw numbers, and she would win all her money back.  He would draw numbers.  And she's, like, a little immigrant lady, and so she was, like, didn't quite understand  the math of it, you know?  And she was just thrilled every time that she would win the lottery, like, every two months.  It really worked.  It was amazing.  It was pretty great.  That is good. 
[02:53:00]  What a buffoon.  Oh, really?  What a dolt.  I don't know the answer.  I'm trying to get your answer.  You'll never get the answer to that one.  Yeah, that one's, I don't know.  That's a lot of fucking money.  That's $600 million.  One fucking winner?  Well, that ends up being, like, $300 million.  It's like, yeah, they take...  It's amazing that they take...  $370.  $370 after taxes.  What's the lump sum, though? 
[02:53:30]  Well, what's the lump sum?  $370.  Oh, you can get $370 right away.  But if you get it over 20 years, what can you get it at?  Oh, well...  It's over 30 years, I believe.  And then they'll tax every dolly you make on that.  You've got to be a nut to fucking take the 20-year thing.  You wouldn't?  No, not for something that big.  If you get $370 tomorrow, who gives a fuck?  $370 million?  After federal taxes, there's no state tax in Florida.  What's the...  They get $278.  Wow.  I wonder what the most...  There's probably a story about it.  What the most amount of money somebody's ever blown is. 
[02:54:00]  Like, the most famous disparaging...  Because you're kind of basically saying that $370 million, you're set up for life.  Yeah, you're pretty much...  But I bet you there's a guy who's blown $370 million.  You know what I mean?  Well, Curt Schilling went through a lot of money.  How much money did he fucking burn through?  I don't know how much he went through, but every time the lottery gets like this big, there's  those stories online of the top 10, you know...  Idiots?  Idiots.  That have won the lottery.  Rags to riches to rags.  Right.  Wow, dopes.  Yeah, there was some lady in Toronto.  $75 million? 
[02:54:30]  No, more than that, right?  $75 million.  He sued for over $75 million from one company.  So he blew through a lot of fucking money.  Wait, he sued through...  He's being sued for $75 million.  His dumb video game company that he made after baseball.  Oh, Schilling.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He is broke, huh?  Yeah, Schilling took all his money and loans and fucking barred from everybody to pump it  into this fucking video game that was kind of like World of Warcraft and EverQuest and  stuff.  You know, one of these...  It wasn't even baseball related? 
[02:55:00]  No.  No, he was a crazy EverQuest fan, and he thought, well, people sign up for this, and it's a  subscriber-based fucking game.  I'm going to put one out.  So it's one of these, you know, dungeons and fucking swords and shit like that.  It just never got off the ground.  Was it good?  I saw some clips of it, and it just looked like a bad version of World of Warcraft.  Hey, but that article says this thing cost him $50 million. 
[02:55:30]  Well, it says...  Of his own.  Later on, it says that...  Oh, because my point really fast, he made more than that, so he would still have millions  left.  It says that the company owed more than $150 million and had less than $22 million in assets.  Oh, he chalked up a lot of debt.  But what was his personal loss?  That whole nut, or just part of it?  I don't know.  I don't think he had a lot of big investors. 
[02:56:00]  I'm guessing if he put $50 million of his own money in, and they only have $22 million  in assets, and they have $100 and something in debt, he's lost all his money.  Well, he lost his $50 million.  Yeah.  But my point is, he made more than $50 million, so he still has millions.  How much did he make?  I would guess.  Yeah.  How much did he get for the sock that he sold?  Yeah.  Well, I hear he's broke.  I hear he's fucking broke.  He probably blew through a lot of money.  We got a lot of questions today.  We need answers to them.  Oh, I'm never going to get answers.  Yeah, this is a very speculative show. 
[02:56:30]  Yes, yes.  No, because I'm assuming he had other investors, so his part was, here's my $50 million, but  he was expecting to turn that $50 million to hundreds of millions, obviously.  I think he coughed up every penny he had.  He sold the sock for $92 grand.  That's all he got for that?  Yep.  Good.  That's what it went for us.  Shithead.  It's a fucking sock.  How much is he worth now is the question.  Did he lose more than the $50 million investment, which is brutal, obviously?  I mean, he probably didn't have that much more. 
[02:57:00]  At his peak, the most he ever made was, in 2005, he made $14.5 million.  He made $114 million over his career.  Okay, that's a lot of fucking money, man.  That's just salary, though.  Not counting his endorsement deals.  But don't forget, you lose a piece to agent and taxes and math.  You lose a good piece of that.  Right.  I think he still has tens of millions of dollars left.  Let's say you lose half of that to agents' taxes.  Plus, he's bought a house.  He's bought cars. 
[02:57:30]  He's bought all kinds of shit.  He has four kids.  Quite a hat collection.  Look, he lost.  He invested $50 million of his own money.  He lost all his baseball earnings.  Right.  Yeah, that's it.  What are the earnings worth there?  Sorry, Sam.  What are the earnings worth there besides baseball earnings?  I don't know, but I know that he put his sock up as bank collateral.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead, Sam.  His net worth right now is listed at $1 million.  And that's like...  Which is probably just the minimum that the website has. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The website doesn't go lower.  Because, yeah, it's called Celebrity Net Worth.  Yeah, they're not going to have like, well, it's $40,000.  Yeah, he's got four kids.  Oh, my God.  And that's how much did he make?  What did he make in his last year?  I forgot to.  His last year, he made $8 million.  His peak year, he made $14.5 million.  How much do you think those kids want to stab Dummy for losing the investment?  Yeah, because they look like they're like high school age, too.  Like, they definitely need to go to college.  Hey, all you kids are playing these games, right? 
[02:58:30]  Oh, God.  All told, he made just under $115 million in baseball.  And now he's left with nada.  Ugh, what an idiot.  Well, a million is still sweet, but he obviously owes all sorts of money.  Yeah, he doesn't have a million, like, just sitting in his checking account.  Yeah, that's all.  Unless he did it through a corporation where he's not personally liable.  I think he went all in.  He did.  Just said, fuck it.  I don't want anyone else.  This is my thing.  He's like, this is my baby.  Watch this.  And if you're sending four kids to college, a million, if you're paying for their college. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, that's like a million.  That million goes quick.  You might as well just take $50 million and go, you know, red.  Right.  At least he got a 50-50 shot.  Well, a little less, but I mean, it's insanity.  Take $50 million of your own money in something as speculative as video gaming.  I got a buddy who, his uncle's a pit boss at a bunch of those, like, you know, crappy,  like, real small town, like, Native American casinos, you know? 
[02:59:30]  And apparently, like, the dirty secret of those places is that they average, like, a suicide a week.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, because it's people who just, like, fuck it, and they just bring the last, yeah,  and they just put it on red, and then when it doesn't work, they hang themselves in the  shower.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  They have nothing to live for if they don't win.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, like, that's, you know, because it's like small town shit, so it's like, I'm going  to take it all, go to the little...  Yeah, here's my shot.  I'm going to do it.  So, whenever I perform at those places, like, I always walk down the hallway in the hotel 
[03:00:00]  and go, like, there's a dead guy behind one of these doors.  Oh, one of these doors.  Someone, yep.  But you know, also, if it does come in, they're going to take that money and eventually try  it again.  Oh, of course.  They're not going to go, oh, this worked out great, I'm leaving now.  Yeah, yeah.  No way.  You've never heard a tech billionaire go, well, you know, it started when I put $10,000 on red.  Yeah.  And then I parlayed that to a billion.  Never.  Speaking of which, how about this fucking New York City kid?  Yeah.  Sold Tumblr to... 
[03:00:30]  Yahoo.  Yahoo.  I was ready to say that.  Went to Yahoo.  Yahoo.  1.1 billion.  Can be 1.1 billion.  High school dropout.  But he was highly intelligent.  He knew high school was not for him.  He was like 26 years old.  He went to Japan and was fooling around there for a little while, then he came back home and  started tinkering around.  All you got to do is figure out...  Came up with Tumblr and fast forward a few years, 1.1 billion.  Some internet fucking...  It's like an archetype of a high school kid at this point.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's like...  There's like the nerd and the jock, and then there's the kid who drops out and fucking 
[03:01:00]  makes a billion dollars in some internet bullshit.  But Yahoo's seeing something there, because Tumblr only made 13 million last year.  That was it.  Wow.  They're seeing...  They made 13 million dollars in revenue last year.  So, I don't know what Yahoo's going to do to turn around around.  Well, with the big Yahoo behind it, I'm sure it'll do nothing.  1.1 billion.  But they scoop up these little companies all the time.  I invented a photo program that went nowhere.  Yeah.  It's a way to print out your photo, and it makes like a spin fan. 
[03:01:30]  Like, you know the things that Japanese people use between their hands, so your picture's  on a fan, and it cools you.  I don't understand why that didn't...  Get shilling on the phone.  See if you'll invest in it.  Yeah, yeah.  I got some money behind that one.  It bombed financially and in the auditory sense.  Jimmy.  Yeah, it didn't do well.  Yeah, you got...  I don't...  I don't know how people could do that.  Like, take your entire life like that and just... 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you know, you could be speculative, but use risk capital.  Only use your risk capital.  We should shut up.  Did you hear about that insane...  Before we move on, we were fortunate enough to get the call to buy some fucking options  in Citadel Broadcasting.  It was...  You're looking at two guys that really thought they were going to be multi-millionaires.  It was the IPO.  Of this fucking deal.  It was the IPO.  The IPO.  We were getting into.  You know, the ground floor.  Major shareholders in Citadel. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, there used to be a time where if someone gave you a call to be in on the IPO, it was  a guarantee almost every time.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  So I went in large.  I went in a hundred and...  What was the exact total?  A hundred and seven thousand.  Oh, shit.  That stock is now worth...  Zero dollars?  Yeah.  Really?  No joke.  It went bankrupt.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Zero.  Oh, dear.  Zero.  They're like, 19 bucks a share to get in.  They're like, oh, right.  19 bucks a share.  And then the next day when it traded, it went up to like 22. 
[03:03:00]  Something like that.  Like, oh, man.  See?  It's on its way up.  Here we go.  Now that $107,000 is worth about $100 and whatever, $40,000.  So if you got out of it two days in, it would have been a smart move.  That was it.  It never saw the initial price ever again.  Oh, shit.  It drastically dropped within a week.  And we both had the same logic.  This can't get that bad.  It'll eventually go up.  It can't completely lose it.  This thing ticked down day after day for years.  And finally, they declared bankruptcy. 
[03:03:30]  And then it got to a level where you're like, fuck, let it ride.  I mean, what the fuck?  I'm going to take 10 grand?  You don't happen to have a $100,000 bloody sock lying around, do you?  Brutal.  Here's the timeline.  After an IPO of 2067 in August 2003.  All right.  We got in at 19.  So, I mean, we barely made a dollar.  We were up $1.67 a share at that point.  And a high of $22.70 in December 2003.  Okay, you're right.  $22.70.  Citadel closed at one cent on March 6, 2009. 
[03:04:00]  Delisting happened.  Well, you had five months of growth there.  Yeah.  Five good solid months.  That leads you to believe it's going on.  But we saw all the other radio companies.  They were in the 40s and the 50s.  So, we're like, okay, we got in at 19.  They fucked that up so bad.  It's up to almost $23.  We got some room here.  And then it went down to one penny.  Fucking cocksucker.  It went down to one fucking penny.  That fucking cock.  It makes me only better.  My parents invested a large amount of their savings into it that the double VCR. 
[03:04:30]  Oh.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You would have thought that would have took, yeah.  Yeah, it was a lot of money they put into the double VCR.  They do all there?  No, I don't know.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, they lost a significant amount of money.  The double VCR, Norton.  We are going to be rich, my friend.  I think any time you invest, like, I mean, how would you know with that, with the thing  you guys did, but like, any time you invest in something like zany, like, really, like  the fucking video game, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Double VCR.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's too gimmicky.  That was like to dub one to another? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, yeah, that was the point.  That's fucking perfect.  You rent something from Blockbuster, you fucking dub it out?  Where could I get in on this?  I think it was like six months before DVDs came out.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Another story, when the merger was going on, they gave us all, like, kind of a stock guy  to do the actual, you know, deal that we had, whatever.  And then he's like, you know, I can help you with some other things.  This was my first dip into financial advisor territory.  Oh, right.  And the guy sold me on a company that was coming up with a drug to cure breast cancer. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, that one.  And he said this, you remember that one too, right?  I played that a couple of times.  I played.  And he's like, you know, this is coming in within the next year or two.  I fucking, fucking believe this idiot.  Bio something.  BioMira.  BioMira.  I made some money on that fucking thing, though.  BioMira.  And he's like, and how he sold it, I'm like, well, fuck, here you go.  And I pushed, like, a whole pile at him.  Oh, no.  And I lost bad with that one too. 
[03:06:00]  But there's, like, always going to be cancer.  Why did you think that?  It's like, there's a pill that's going to end racism.  Fantastic.  Let's throw it on that.  BioMira.  I'll fake that I took it and spit it out when the nurse leaves.  Check out of your tongue to make sure you took your time.  That was boiler room shit.  And then finally I was like, what am I doing?  So I just got a boring, boring Jew that keeps it real safe.  Oh, he needs that pill.  Right.  Oh, he does need the.  The pill that stops racism. 
[03:06:30]  I love that.  I lost, oh.  No, I'm just thinking how funny that would be.  But now it's like, you know, fuck those guys.  Just keep it safe.  I lost all my money on a fucking investment.  I believed in it strongly.  Oh, really?  I was that, Jim.  Yeah.  Is it the stripper in the Poconos?  I lost a lot on her.  It was, this is a really good, it was, I believe very strongly it was called Melba Water.  Because we all love Melba Toast and we all love water.  So it tasted like, it tasted like Melba Toast. 
[03:07:00]  Well, Fiddy made a lot of money with the vitamin water, right?  Right, but this had actually had crispy hunks of Melba Toast in it.  You're thinking Melba Water.  This had little hunks of toast in the water.  Oh, toast in your water.  Yeah.  Well, that's great.  And you can suck it down and get a nutritious meal and a delicious treat at the same time.  And Melba Water.  That's terrible.  Yeah, I know.  I like the fucking amount of E-Trade these days.  You put money in an E-Trade account and then you're just like, all right, well, Apple is announcing earnings, so I'll fucking spin the wheel and go like, maybe it'll be up, maybe it'll be down. 
[03:07:30]  Fucking fuck around with that.  Yeah, you just screw around like that.  Beats the horses.  I got killed on the fucking stupid Preakness.  What the fuck happened to Orb?  Orb did nothing.  They basically said he can't lose.  They spent two hours in the pre-show, whatever the fuck they called, saying, yeah, this guy can't lose.  This horse can't lose.  It was awful.  Fucking stupid horse.  I had that horse.  I had an X-Acto with Orb and any other horse in the whole race could have won. 
[03:08:00]  So all it had to be was Orb had to win the race.  There you go.  And then I would have had like an X-Acto.  And I put quite a few bucks on it.  But no, the horse couldn't fucking do shit.  He didn't do shit.  It was dangerous when you could bet right from this now.  Oh, so you weren't even there.  Here's my casino.  You didn't go to it.  No, no.  I just fucking...  Twinspires.com.  I'm like, yeah, I'll bet this.  I'll bet that.  And then you just watch the race. 
[03:08:30]  And they're off.  You watch it on your phone.  It's the sickest fucking thing.  Literally, it's very sick.  They shouldn't do it.  It's very dangerous.  And then E-Trades and other things.  It's like, oh, the market's open.  Why don't I invest?  It's not investing.  You're betting.  You're not investing money if you're fucking betting on a company for a day.  All right.  Yeah.  Shilling really is fucked.  Yep.  People that know way more than us.  No.  His company accepted a $75 million loan from Rhode Island to move his biz there, then went bankrupt. 
[03:09:00]  Wow.  Shilling made personal guarantees on the loans.  To get the loans, he used his own assets as collateral and made personal guarantees.  That's Angry Mike 28 with that.  That's the sack.  Zeket, I guess it is, on Twitter also.  Damn.  Yeah, so he's completely broke.  I bet there's some shenanigans going on.  And his career is over, obviously, so he can't just fucking say, fuck it, I'll pitch  a few more.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's get some money back. 
[03:09:30]  Right?  Oh, he's fucked.  I've got to get back out there and fucking throw a few.  I don't like to give away where my money is going.  Oh, yes.  But I will tell you about a company I believe very strongly in.  Yeah.  They make ceiling vacuums for your foyer.  Just for your foyer?  It's like a fan, an internal fan, like a, you know, in the bathroom, you have a, in  the bathroom, you have a, and it sucks the smell out.  This is much more powerful.  It's about a thousand times more powerful.  So when you walk in the house, it's just, you don't have to take your hat off. 
[03:10:00]  Your hat, but it's also a hat remover?  That's what, that's all it is.  When you walk in the house, you just flip the switch and it sucks your hat up to the ceiling.  All right.  But how much does it cost?  I mean, if it's reasonable.  It's very reasonable.  It's $1,800 plus, it's about $2,200 to install.  And on your way out the door, you just shut the thing off and the hat falls.  We haven't gotten that part perfected yet.  So for the whole time that you're in the house, it would be stuck to the ceiling.  It's got to just, it's making like noise. 
[03:10:30]  But what happens is it comes with a free hat top duster.  Because there's a lot of dust that gets sucked up.  So people complain that their hats were filthy.  And their scarves got sucked up there and child's toys and other things.  Yes.  What about things that are light?  You got to go on Shark Tank with that.  Yeah.  I think the boys would love that one.  The foyer hat vacuum.  Everything you have involves hats.  As it should.  It's a fun punchline.  Yes.  It's a good word.  Who doesn't love a white hat? 
[03:11:00]  What's up with Biomirror?  Do we have any info on this?  It has sex with man mirrors.  I guess the fucking thing was supposed to be my...  I have to piss.  Oh.  I got it kind of leaky, too.  Take a leaky, Jimmy.  What, uh, yeah, I'd love to see what this stock's at.  Ugh.  I don't...  I'm out of...  Is it bankrupt?  Yeah, I think the company's closed.  Oh, what happened?  Yelp says it's closed.  How's that, uh...  How's that drug doing?  So that's another zero.  Wow.  That's another zero in my portfolio.  Another zero.  Another donut for the Opster.  Yep.  Opster's got two zeros in his fucking portfolio. 
[03:11:30]  You were talking about degenerate gambling.  Oh, yeah.  Being in recovery as I am, I get asked to do these, like, conventions and stuff like that,  you know?  Mm-hmm.  And I went...  It doesn't happen to be my problem, but it's the same world.  Like, I got asked to do a Gambler's Anonymous one, you know?  Uh-huh.  So I went...  I met this dude.  This is no bullshit.  He had these fingers.  Like, he had his index and thumbs.  Oh.  And that is it on both...  He's like a fucking crab person. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, man.  You know what I mean?  Oh, the lobster people.  Because...  No.  Because bookies took the other three.  Oh!  They took his fucking fingers.  They took...  Like, they took six of his fucking fingers, and they left him with the card-playing fingers...  To pay his debt off.  Yeah.  And it's like, as an addict, I completely understand losing all three on the one hand.  Like, I get that you have, like, a pincer on the one...  Oh, my God.  And then I can even get how you'd lose the pinky on the other one, because it's like,  all right, like, I think things are going to turn around for me.  But then once you lose, like, this one, like, the ring finger... 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then, like, you don't see a pattern.  By that time, like, he still gambled away the middle finger on his other hand.  I...  He really thought he might fucking pull it off with that one.  I can't imagine the one...  He was just left, like, a little crab man.  I can imagine the one pinky.  You'd be like...  You'd have to really sit and assess your life as, like, wow, because of gambling, they  took my finger like a fucking movie.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's got to stop.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  But, I mean, you know, the pinky, like, I think you could...  If you're an addict, like, I think you can justify away that one.  You're like, nobody even uses that one anyway.  You know?  It's useless.  Was it six incidents, or was it one?  I suspect it was six separate incidents.  Six separate times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Because, like, and then what's left?  Like, they're going to take his thumbs.  Like, that's the only thing that fucking separates from animals.  You know what I mean?  Like, he would have been...  Like, this is what keeps us from the monkeys.  Wait, how far down did they take the finger, though?  Like, all the way.  Like, he had no finger. 
[03:13:30]  So, he just had, like, this, like, weird, like...  Right.  That was his hand.  Yeah.  So.  Wow, that's really committing yourself to the...  Yeah, it was impressive.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  No, I, uh, I like playing some cards and stuff.  But I couldn't imagine getting in that much trouble.  Yeah, that's a lot of, like...  I mean, who do you even...  Yeah, yeah.  I played a few poker games, you know.  You throw in some money, a few hundred bucks.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Did you ever see Dirty Work with Norm MacDonald?  There's a great...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Chevy Chase is the doctor, and he has, like, a horrible gambling problem.  And he keeps coming in.  Like, every time you see him on screen, he's, like, way more fucked up than he was the last  time, because, like, bookies have, you know...  And he comes in, he's got, like, his arm in a sling and whatever, you know.  And he's, like, here's the...  This is my favorite line.  He goes, like, here's the thing I don't understand.  You know, you owe a bookie money.  He takes your toe.  You still have to give him the money.  Like, I love that part.  Like, as though the logic would be, like, they'll just settle for your finger.  Right.  Settle up.  Like, yeah, yeah.  It should be washed, no? 
[03:14:30]  My finger's worth that much?  No, you still owe the money?  And the juice is still running?  What the fuck?  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I met a dude with seven DUIs at one of those once.  That's pretty impressive.  That's another thing.  It's, you know, obviously you have a problem.  You know, not the drinking, but you can't drive when you're drunk.  Yeah.  Some people are good at it.  Some aren't.  Right.  They're talking about lowering it to .05, the blood alcohol level, which is...  I mean, you can absolutely drive on .05. 
[03:15:00]  Do you really believe, though, that some people are good at it and some are not?  It's like, or you just think that those people are lucky, like...  There's an element of luck, but there's an element of luck, you know, just driving any  day.  Right.  But, I gotta tell you, I did a great job.  I could drive drunk pretty fucking safely.  I drive like a lunatic when I'm not drinking.  Right.  Because I know it's just, all right, I'll get pulled over, I'll fucking yap a little  to the cop, maybe get a ticket, and that's it.  It's not this, oh my god, life-changing moment of getting a DUI, where there's months of 
[03:15:30]  legal fees and lawyers and all that shit.  So, when I would be drinking, I would fucking tend into it.  Middle lane, cruise control, and fucking concentrate, pay attention.  That's not a good argument, though, because I'm a fucking maniac otherwise, is not a good  argument.  Like, they would say, well, the way you drive when you're drunk, you should be driving that  way sober, too.  Well, yeah.  And I do, for the most part.  But, yeah, but I mean, and you can't use it as, like, if the cop pulls you over, you  can't be like, you should see how I drive sober. 
[03:16:00]  Like, you know, I don't think that.  You should see, I'm doing a great job here.  If you think this is bad with that little seven-year-old leg in my grill, you ought to  see me sober.  I've never, I never got a DUI, or, um, I don't even think I ever got pulled over when I was  drunk.  Well, I did.  I, I, I got out of five of them.  And I, and I finally got the sixth one.  Just swing that, you shoot the cop.  Yeah.  I got out of the DUI.  I blasted him and threw the window.  No, it was, like, in tiny towns, you just tell them you're the comic in town and they  think it's interesting or whatever, you know, like, that kind of thing. 
[03:16:30]  Like, tell me a joke.  Yeah, yeah, that kind of happens, that kind of shit.  So, I literally got, and, and I did the sobriety test sometimes, and I would, like, I really  thought I was good at it.  Like, that's the bullshit logic of it.  And, uh, cause, cause, cause one time I actually, uh, uh, I completely blackout drunk drove across  four states, and I have no recollection of doing it.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  From Kentucky to Iowa.  And I, like, I just remember at three in the morning in Kentucky going, like, or no,  I remember, like, that night going to the club going, don't drink, cause I had a 10 hour 
[03:17:00]  drive the next day.  So, I was like, if I fuck around, I'm not gonna make it.  And then at three in the morning, I remember being drunk.  And that's it.  That's all I remember.  Wow.  Well, just take, uh, take a consolation of the fact that while you were driving, you  knew what you were doing.  Well, that's the crazy, I have no, it's like, I'm like meatloaf.  I have no, so what happened is, like, I wake up at five o'clock the next day in the  hotel and I'm like, I'm totally fucked.  Like, I've missed the show.  Like, like, I hadn't missed the show yet, but it's a 10 hour drive.  Like, mathematically, this is impossible.  I'm not gonna make it.  So, I just start running around the room to, like, get my shit together.  I don't know what to, and I, and my bag's already packed, which is weird. 
[03:17:30]  So, I, like, grab, and I'm like, oh, I must have packed my bag when I was drunk.  Wow.  And as I'm, like, walking around the room, I'm like, this isn't the same hotel room that  I've been staying in for the last couple days.  Fuck.  And I fucking, I did an entire drive, which means I left after three in the morning.  Like, so, that means I drove through a rush hour somewhere.  Oh, shit.  And I stopped to get gas at some point.  And I checked into a hotel.  And just don't remember any of it.  No, it was, like, time traveling.  I have no recollection of any of that trip.  And I just got there, and I checked in the parking lot.  My car was kind of, like, a little askew in the space. 
[03:18:00]  But, you know, and so, like, I went out to, like, make sure there wasn't a fucking, you  know, pink bicycle under my car or whatever.  And everything seems fine.  Like, I never got any feedback negatively from that.  So, I was like, but the irony is that people ask me, like, oh, so that's obviously when  you stop drinking.  And it's like, no, not at all.  Like, that told me I'm a fucking excellent drunk driver.  I rule.  It led me to believe I could totally get away with it.  Yeah.  What did make you stop?  The DUI that I got in New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You couldn't get out of it? 
[03:18:30]  No.  And you know what?  I was so, like, apparently, it's in the police report.  I thanked the cop for arresting me at the time.  Because, like, I needed to have somebody.  Because, like, I got to the point where it was, like, DUIs aren't even going to stop me.  Because I can get out of him, you know?  Wow.  And so, like, I finally, when I did get the guy, I, like, thank you.  So, I call him every year on my anniversary.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  So, right.  You're with these phone calls.  Is he cool to you, though, when you call him?  He was really weird about it for the first couple years.  Because he's, like, kind of an awkward guy.  Right.  But, you know, I think that nobody really ever does. 
[03:19:00]  Like, I bet you the DUIs do get people sober.  Like, not just me.  And I bet you, like, nobody ever really does say, like, hey, thanks for doing it.  It'll be eight in two weeks.  Oh, that's great.  So, when he pulled you over, did you know you were fucked up?  Did you try the comic thing?  Or what did you try?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, see, the weird thing is, like, I remember seeing those cops in a gas station.  Like, I pulled in to get food because I knew I was wasted.  So, I was like, I better get something in me.  And as soon as I walked into the convenience store, I remember seeing those two guys and  going, like, be cool.  And they probably saw you.  Yeah, yeah.  And I thought I was, like, playing it off. 
[03:19:30]  But I guess they then, like, started following me because they're like, that guy's shit face.  So, they just followed me for, you know, it took me, like, they took them, I think it's,  like, 18 miles from that gas station.  So, they followed me for a while.  They were state troopers.  And they went to skate over the line a little?  No.  They got me for, I guess they couldn't get me for anything.  They needed probable cause.  And I really applaud them for this.  It might be, but I flicked a cigarette out the window, so they got me for littering.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, they wanted something.  Yeah.  Anything.  Which, like, I'm so thrilled that they did that, though. 
[03:20:00]  Like, because, you know, nothing else was going to stop me, you know?  Boy, you must have been doing fine, though, if they couldn't pull you over beforehand.  That's the thing.  It's like, I thought I was a good drunk driver.  Apparently, you were.  But at some point, that was going to fucking catch up to me.  You know what I mean?  You're a great drunk driver until you're not.  And usually, when you're not, it's a bad scene.  Yeah, yeah.  I told great for, I never had a problem.  What happened?  I ran into a fucking van and killed six people.  Oh, that was your first problem?  Yeah.  Yeah, when you meet a guy who's like, or not me, when you hear about a guy who, like, 
[03:20:30]  killed 13 kids in a bus accident, you don't ever go, like, well, how was he driving before?  Yeah, yeah.  What was the rest of his driving record like?  Oh, he killed plenty of people like that.  It was a spotless driving record up to that point.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, wow.  That's, no, it's scary, though.  I remember being pretty ripped a few times driving home, and you're just looking in the  mirror, and it's like, oh, my God, there's a cop back there.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Okay, God, God, please don't have him pull me over, okay? 
[03:21:00]  Please strike someone dead right now so that they have to leave.  Well, that's what's so amazing about getting pulled over now, like, because I lived with  that fear for so long that, like, if I get pulled over at two in the morning now, it's  like the most liberating.  Like, it's great, because it's like, fucking.  Hey, guy.  Whatever.  How you doing tonight?  It's great.  You all right?  Nice.  Good for you.  Because they assume I'm drunk.  Like, that's my favorite part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, he's coming up under the impression that he's going to get me.  Yeah.  But, yeah, you just roll the window and go, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was  fucking with you.  I was fucking with you.  Nah, I was fucking with you. 
[03:21:30]  I'm a comedian.  You hear the one about the, uh, fag cop?  He put a nice thing in his own asshole and then took a shit on it and speed off.  I had to take that class, you know what I mean?  Like, when you get convicted of a DUI, you got to go and take a DUI class or whatever.  Like, it's a.  It's got to be a treat.  Oh, dude, it was the worst.  Like, I went to, like, Catholic school, so, like, I never had the dangerous  minds experience you know with like the fucking just public school shitheads like just these  animals throwing things around the classroom this is like a grown-ups at a dui class in in flushing 
[03:22:00]  in queens and like all of them were just fucking animals they're like throwing paper airplanes  around the room and like throwing spitballs at this burnout who's teaching the class you know  what i mean and and uh the one guy was from china like straight up didn't speak a fucking word of  english they were just pushing him through like just sit here for an hour we'll sign your paper  like he literally couldn't participate in the thing and there was another dude in the class  was like taking nips of a flask the whole time when the teacher that's a great segue  drunk in the fucking class what's that nice that was a great segue 
[03:22:30]  oh i get it totally wow that's fun they're gonna have a pill for that soon oh yeah racism pill yeah  so uh yeah so uh you know one guy's drunk and whatever and then like there was this moment in  the class like i was the only guy who like i was really making an honest effort to change my life  around you know because like i've been a drunk for so many years that that i'm like really like paying  attention and whatever you know and trying to do the right thing and everybody else is like using it 
[03:23:00]  as like an like how can i get away with it next time you know they're like does that penny thing  work where you like they're asking questions about how to not get it trading like prison house  fucking recipes for booze and yeah yeah how to make a shank and uh so you know they put that  one time they put that chart on the board that tells you you know like how much you weigh versus  how many drinks you can have you know like that thing yeah and to be honest like i didn't want to  know what that said because i knew i could trick myself like i bet you if i knew how much i could get  away with i probably would try you know so so i didn't write down the list so then like we i get 
[03:23:30]  into the thing and the guy's like hey jesse how much can you have and still be okay to drive  in three hours and i was like well none and he goes no that's wrong oh and i was like well  technically no but it's right for me like it's not wrong but just for me i'm not gonna like and  i'm like clearly i'm not the first person to ever gotten sober in one of these but he goes uh what  does your chart say and i know the science behind it yeah he goes what the chart say and i got him  write down the chart he goes we got a fucking troublemaker like like i was the problem in the 
[03:24:00]  class the whole time because you don't want to drink at all when you're driving this guy's from  fucking china like it was insane how they didn't oh my god see you buddy bye i have a flight at noon  so i'm leaving right now but uh oh jimmy jimmy i'll see you thursday and uh stress factory this  weekend and jesse you're just hilarious man oh you're a safe flight jimmy norton and jesse's gonna  be hilarious in uh jacksonville at the comedy club yes this weekend thursday friday and saturday  yeah and then uh myrtle beach south carolina at the carolina comedy club may 28th through the 30th 
[03:24:30]  right jessejoyce.com do you know the last time i was at that club uh i do this thing i think it's  kind of fun with like uh oh like new guys like brand new mcs who are real nervous you know they're  like 18 they don't know what they're doing you know just to break the ice with them you know like  they always come up real nervous and like they don't want to fuck anything up so they're like  yo what do you what do you want me to say about you and they'll have like a pen and a piece of paper  ready to go so they don't mess up your intro or something it doesn't fucking matter you could  go up and like just bang on a pot and go jesse joyce and it's the same exact nobody cares right 
[03:25:00]  but so uh so i was just to like break the ice and fuck with them i go uh i was gonna like hey listen  i don't care what you say just make sure they know i don't think the holocaust happened right i just  think it's a funny whatever like it just and they like like they just laugh you know because it breaks  whatever it's funny thing so i did that in myrtle beach and like i just totally naturally i've done  that for years and and i was like he laughed so i was like you can make an assumption there he  fucking did it oh wow like i thought he got the joke but he clearly he went up and he was like i  don't know this next comedian the headliner just wants you to know that the holocaust didn't happen 
[03:25:30]  here he is jesse joyce like that's how i went up in front of a group and i was like what the fuck  you know and ironically it probably would have gone a lot worse if it wasn't myrtle beach  there was like a significant pocket of people in the room who were like  well let's hear what this guy has to say like all right finally i gotta like this guy's ideas  now we're in for some entertainment  yeah yeah whoops yeah whoops wow that's a pretty that's a a guy that really doesn't understand like 
[03:26:00]  hey you're joking he's like 18 or whatever like i just think yeah i don't know i thought he thought  that i was like this is gonna be hilarious but he doesn't yeah yeah there's no possibility six years  later no possibility he got it and then decided fuck no he wasn't watch what i do now no because  he was very nervous like there's no way he was like fuck this guy yeah so oops with that i think  we're gonna wrap up for today cool uh yeah look at the one with the time it's 10 o'clock my goodness 
[03:26:30]  jesse joyce thank you so much yes sir thanks for coming in coming in it was fun you always have uh  great stories oh thanks man yeah you guys are fun to hang with great stories that are funny  well that helps that does help all right all right man take it easy and uh bye  you bet it is after opian anthony live with me sam roberts 
[03:27:00]  here on the opian anthony channel 866 wow one wow is the phone number we got  opie sudoku if you want it you want to call in and let me know what did you learn  on today's opian anthony show  i love the breakdown of celebrity apprentice mainly because i love celebrity apprentice but i think  it's absolutely true donald trump was just sitting there waiting just sitting there waiting 
[03:27:30]  he knew pendulet was going to do a good job he said i got to get him back on this show  because pendulet writes this book and he writes a chapter about celebrity apprentice and he's making  fun of donald trump's hair and he's uh saying the show is not a difficult show to do he's got all this  going on and and and and what we found out was he wrote a letter of apology to donald trump after it  came out but that was like a private thing that was something that he just did so you know maybe 
[03:28:00]  he was uh feeling guilty about it maybe he felt like he didn't want donald trump to take it the  wrong way i don't know for sure but he privately sent him a letter of apology and said you know i  just want you to know that i meant no ill will and blah blah blah he said that trump's hair looked  like piss cotton candy but still he meant no ill will by it he's just joking around right so donald trump  he goes apology accepted but that apology was not accepted he's sitting on that apology note 
[03:28:30]  for like a year and a half just waiting for the moment to come and then he pitches to nbc all right  why don't we do all-star celebrity apprentice so we can bring back people that have previously been  on the show and nbc's like well i mean i never really thought of that but i guess we could all  because why else would you bring pendulet back for a second season so he gets him back and he goes  well first we need pendulet back on the show right oh yeah i guess he did great last time he gets 
[03:29:00]  pendulet back on the show task after task you're doing a great job pen you're doing a great job  pen yeah we'll pass you through no problem buddy you're fired i don't think so you're doing too good  of a job pen we love having you on the show then what happens he gets pen all the way to the finals  the live finals the show that everybody watches i mean you didn't hear about celebrity apprentice on  the opian anthony show before this week or last week right because it wasn't the finals yet now  everybody's talking about it what's trump gonna do he's gonna use those final moments of that episode 
[03:29:30]  to boom drop the hammer you know pen you said some not nice things about me some not nice things  about the show you apologized though didn't you now pen has to admit on national television  that he apologized to donald trump and do a little bit of groveling let him know i didn't mean anything  by i i mean ever since then i've only said nice things about you in the show and blah blah blah  at that moment pen knows he's sunk and so on one end he asks pendulet about the horrible things he said 
[03:30:00]  about him a year and a half ago then he turns to trace atkins and says trace he's the other finalist  what did you learn being here or whatever it was what do you what do you think of your time on  celebrity apprentice the most softball tell me how great you are question and boom the big announcement  trace atkins wins celebrity apprentice if you don't think the fix was in from the beginning  sorry you're naive i'm sorry pendulet but this time you were outsmarted let's go to uh area code 
[03:30:30]  210 you're on after open anthony live hey sam it's lady trucker how are you good now did you  get off level 29 on candy crush no lady trucker i didn't get off level 29 of candy crush i've been  there for a week and i cannot let go i can't get past level 29 okay well maybe everybody stands  all right i'm hanging up on you you obviously can't form a sentence but it's that goddamn candy 
[03:31:00]  crush and opie talked about it and a couple of weeks ago i would make fun of anybody who played  candy crush because it sounds stupid and it looks dumb like it looks like a little kids game and it's  candy all dropping and everything and just to say candy crush is a stupid thing to say it's like very  sort of it's almost feminine to say oh yeah i play candy crush but you start playing that game i'm  telling you it's addictive and you won't stop they keep putting out new levels you can have people 
[03:31:30]  send you lives on facebook but those goddamn levels i was breezing through them boom boom boom and then  i get to level 29 and i can't get past it for the life of me i can't break enough jellies to get past  that level and then the stupid game that drives me what drives me crazy about this candy crush game  and if you played it don't knock it till you try it you start playing that game i guarantee you you'll 
[03:32:00]  be on board with it they give you hints right as you're playing the game because the object  is to match up like candy you have to get three candies in a row it looks almost like a full tetris  board you get three candies in a row when you get those three candies they explode and they  disappear and you have to disappear a certain amount of candies that's the whole object of  every game so they give you hints and let you know oh look these three are together you could  move these three to knock the whole thing out and you go okay i'll take your hint they're always the 
[03:32:30]  worst fucking hints imaginable all they do is lead you in wrong directions yeah it knocks out candies  but it's it's the worst move you could possibly make never accept the hints  four seven eight you're on after open anthony live hey is this uh sam roberts am i on the air  you are cool i want to play uh what did i learn okay okay all right i learned that if you go up to  western canada yeah you got a bunch of coins if you get that little coin on uh the stripper's uh 
[03:33:00]  what is it magnet no you're too slow buddy too slow area code 302 you're on after open anthony live  sam roberts professional broadcaster that's right  sam um about the um celebrity apprentice finale i've never watched a show i never watched anything  on tv with donald trump in it but trace atkins said he sold the most ice cream and he raised the 
[03:33:30]  most money that made him the winner no no no don uh pendulet sold more ice cream trace atkins might  have made more money he might have got some celebrities to come in and put some dollars down  but uh pendulet moved more pints well i'm i'm just saying that trace said he sold more ice cream  trace can say whatever he wants to the fix is not in against trace well i understand that and about  some old business what happened to the stalker petty stalker patty fez whatley wedding was that 
[03:34:00]  just a huge work oh my god that's a great question i hadn't even thought about that so much stuff  happens that you forget about some of the day-to-days maybe at some point one of the round  fez guys will be wandering around down here and i can find out if this whole thing is happening sal  you haven't heard anything about the stalker patty fez wedding have you remember that was supposed to  happen yeah that i haven't heard about that in a really long time i guess it's on the back burner  because i thought it was supposed to happen around wrestlemania time and that was a month ago  i can text uh i hope i just hope they're still in love 
[03:34:30]  i hope they haven't fallen out of love thanks buddy hey sam yeah buddy is uh eric there no eric  has taken a personal day for himself today oh i wanted to yell something what did you want to  yell we can hear you where he is all right i'll talk to you later five six seven  hey sam uh one thing i wait till you get to level 67 or 65 i'm paying you to crash i have been on 
[03:35:00]  that for two months well this is this is what i'm afraid of is that i'm going to get past level 29  finally at some point i can only i can only dream that i will and i'll get past level 29 and then  every level is going to be as fucking complicated as this one is i don't know and then you know that  they're not doing anything to help you because halfway through the game they'll let you know  that there's no possible you know candy combinations to do anymore and they'll have to resort everything  and so it's like well why wouldn't you give me a good level to begin with 
[03:35:30]  that's true uh did you hear anything about what happened with extreme rules by chance last night  yeah i was watching it i watched the whole show  i'd hate to ask for spoilers but can you give me some  well what do you want to know i'll give you a little bit of spoilers  uh the john cena and ryback match  it ended in a no contest there was a good spot at the end of the match  john cena and ryback wrestled in the last man standing  but they both just had to get helped out by an ambulance so nobody was left as the last man standing 
[03:36:00]  there was nobody standing  yeah it looked cool when it happened but there's nobody standing  all right thanks a lot  all right buddy  and and and uh and the other thing with candy crush  is that they have everything figured out  so they give you five lives right  and then at the end of the five lives  you have to wait  like 20 minutes to an hour  before you can get another life  so you have to go through these five 
[03:36:30]  you die you die you die  you got to retry though  because it's addicting like i said  so you keep retrying  and all of a sudden they won't let you  unless unless  you pay goddamn 99 cents  and then they'll give you five more lives  99 cents  and so people are just plunking down  plunking down plunking down  you're not even gambling on anything  at least with slot machines  when you're putting in quarter after quarter after quarter  until you realize your life savings are gone  at least you're gambling  at least there's some kind of possibility  like the reason you do that 
[03:37:00]  is so you can make back your money right  but with this goddamn candy crush  it's just  it's just feeding this monster of a machine  because i've done it  and i never pay for apps  i hate paying for apps  and i've had to plunk  i mean you guys know  i hate paying for anything  my tv is  14 inches for god's sake  eric in oklahoma  hey good morning sam  what's up buddy  hey uh  wanted to say that i learned this 
[03:37:30]  on the opening anthony show  it's probably not a good idea  to drink and drive  yeah i think uh jesse joyce  and by the way jesse joyce  always a great guest  the reason i like jesse joyce in studio  i think this was his second time  if i'm not mistaken  is because  he always  knows a guy  you know what i mean  like he knows so many people  that have been through  whatever it is that we're talking about  but yeah  i would probably agree with him  in the sense that anybody  who says that they're a good drunk driver  just hasn't gotten busted yet 
[03:38:00]  drew  in uh  either louisiana or los angeles  yeah louisiana  all right what's up buddy  well sam  i've got a two-year-old  that plays with my phone  and he'll pull up  he'll pull up candy crush  and use up all of my fucking lives  what an asshole  oh dude that's what i tell him  i'm like  what's wrong with you  you're gonna time out dude  exactly  you dickhead  daddy only gets so many lives  okay this is  now i gotta wait like  a day and a half  before i can fucking play again 
[03:38:30]  no you know what you do  is you could  whatever bank account  you're saving money  for a little junior  to go to college  is exactly  where the itunes money  is coming out of  because 99 cents  from his college account  should be going back  into that game  that's a pretty solid idea  i like that  yeah  wait till  wait till level 35  after you get past this  when i've been stuck  on that for a month  did you have  did you have  problems with level 29  i did  yeah okay good  i'm not alone  this is how obsessive  thank you drew  this is how obsessive  this game is  number one 
[03:39:00]  it's making fathers  angry at their children  and number two  people are actually  stuck on a level  for a month  can you imagine  any game  that's not this game  and i i i have  no problem  putting down  a video game  i don't spend a lot  of time playing video games  i'm very bad at them  especially like  xbox and playstation  games horrible  at them  terrible video game  player  can you imagine  not being able  to put it down  can you imagine  being stuck on a level 
[03:39:30]  for a month  and still playing  that's what this game  does to people  it's horrible  sal in huntington  hey sam  listen if you go  on your iphone  if you change the  settings  if you change the  date on your phone  you get more lives  automatically  that's what opie  said that he does  he says he changes  the date  but i feel like  that's really falling  in to candy crush  addiction  when you start  actually changing  the date on your  phone so that  it can't keep up  with what time it  is i feel like  you're way  you're investing  way too much 
[03:40:00]  and maybe that's  better than  shoving 99 cents  into it every time  but i feel like  that's too much  hey you know  whatever you gotta do  to get past level 29  you know what i mean  it's true  whatever you gotta do  by any means necessary  get past that level  thank you sal  rick in florida  hey there sam  i've spent uh  over 300 hours  of my own money  on a facebook game  what game  what  what game  marvel avengers  and you spent  three how old are you  48 
[03:40:30]  oh my god  you're a grown ass  man  and you're spending  i'm a grown ass  man and i'm addicted  to that damn game  what is it just  i dream about it  are you trying to get  like is it an escape  from your family life  you dream about the game  yeah sometimes  if i'm playing it  then i'm a truck driver  so i i drive  i i get on probably  about three times a week  and when i'm on it  i'm on it for  12 hours at a time  yeah and it's like  so addicting for me  and i've spent over 
[03:41:00]  300 hours  i mean it's just  the way it is  it's just i mean  sometimes we're out here  in different truck stops  and there's nothing to do  it's and you see  you're sitting there  playing avengers  for 12 hours on facebook  yeah  oh my god  did your family know  that you're dropping  hundreds of dollars  yeah my fiancee  is not too crazy  about it but  she kind of understands  she has her own  addictions i guess  she could say  so  she kind of understands it  let's just see  what's the money  spent on  oh you buy gold 
[03:41:30]  to get different weapons  recruit other players  to buy energy  uh to move up  in different levels  do a different adventure  and it's also stupid  because eventually  you get to the point  where either you beat  the game  or you get bored  of the game  and the only thought  in your head is  i wish i hadn't spent  that fucking 300  on this game  i'm an idiot  the thing is  which is really  i mean i can see  the computer games  out there  with their point of view  but it's like  just a lot of those 
[03:42:00]  games out there  if you want to play them  now they're making  it online only  now i can't get  online all the time  you're a truck driver  yeah i'm sitting  at shippers  and receivers  and i can't get  online  well i can if i buy  one of those  stupid cards  but then you're  paying so much money  one of those  dude you you know  damn well  you know you're  about a week away  from driving down  the road at 70  miles an hour  with your laptop  on your lap  and playing  goddamn avengers  and jackknifing  into a family 
[03:42:30]  of seven  or eight  or eight  depending  all right thanks rick  it's weird what  happens and then  i'm sitting there  you know watching tv  or whatever with my  wife  and it's humiliating  because i'm just  sitting there on my  phone  boop boop boop boop  boop boop  i always keep it on  silent because i  don't want that  girly candy crush  music playing  but it's obvious  what i'm doing  because i won't  take the phone  away from my  eyes  and i'm just  moving candy  with my finger  and jess goes 
[03:43:00]  are you playing  you playing candy  crush over there  you know it's so  you could you  could ask the  question politely  and say oh  what are you  doing over there  playing candy  crush but candy  crush is something  that it's so easy  to make it sound  like a shitty  thing to do  uh mark in  florida  hey um if  you're frustrated  with having to  wait 30 minutes  for a next  flight wait  until you get  to i think  it's like level  35 or so  where they start  every 10 or  15 levels  they make you  complete three  challenges but 
[03:43:30]  you can not  number challenges  but just  challenges  and you can  only do one  challenge every  24 hours  so if you  complete one  challenge you  have to wait  24 hours before  you can advance  in the game  how much money  do i have to  give them how  much money do  they want before  i can advance i'll  give them whatever  they want  i don't know what  it is because i  don't i refuse to  pay for anything  but but some  people do some  people do i  know yeah  during during that  24 hours when i'm  waiting i go back  to the level that  i've already completed  and try to get  three stars on  everything they 
[03:44:00]  have these i can  keep playing  they have these  little bonuses  where you can  you can do  things to make  it easier to  beat a level  and i and i  sit there clicking  like oh how  much is this and  like one of them  is five dollars  there's one bonus  thing i don't even  get how it works  but i'm tempted  because it must be  a miracle worker  there's a bonus  thing that you can  add to the game  that they charge  forty dollars for  it's 39.99 for  an iphone game  add-on and you  know people are  doing it because  this game is a  sickness  thanks mark 
[03:44:30]  my wife was  pissed at me  last night  because i was  sitting there  playing candy  crush while we  were watching  the movie and  i had no idea  what was going  on in the movie  and had to keep  asking questions  and she was not  pleased at all  yeah you get it  because you don't  want to give up on  the movie entirely  so you keep asking  questions like oh  what just happened  there and she  if you're playing  candy crush you're  playing candy crush  just give up on  the movie no no i  can do both i'm  multitasking  yeah i think this  is all opie's fault  though  what did he get  you hooked on it  yeah yeah of  course i'm talking  about i didn't even  know it existed  until he was 
[03:45:00]  talking about it  oh boy he really  is a destroyer  yeah  all right buddy  all right have a  good one man  talk to you later  oh i want to  yeah rick in  wisconsin you're  on after open  anthony live  prime time  what's up buddy  you know all you  need to do is just  link it up to your  facebook and you  don't have to pay  anything  no you still got  to pay for lives if  your facebook friends  aren't giving them to  you  and and and i don't  want to ask facebook  friends for lives to 
[03:45:30]  candy crush because i  don't want my facebook  friends there's not  that many of them i  don't want my facebook  friends knowing that  like i'm one of those  guys that's just  sitting there waiting  by his phone hoping  because you can link it  to your facebook and  then people on facebook  can actually send you  extra lives right and  i don't want them to  realize that i'm one of  those people that's  going to send out  requests for lives and  just stares at the phone  waiting oh i hope  somebody answers i hope  somebody answers this is  what's on my mind  look at your look at 
[03:46:00]  your call everybody's on  i know i make sure i  mean but but you sit  there you know it's not  healthy like it couldn't  possibly be that there  is that little going on  in the world that candy  crush should take up this  much space in your brain  it's a stupid game it's  it's the dumbest thing  in the world go to  your fucking pc you can  get all the free shit  without paying for it  i'm scared thank you  rick it's just i don't  want to do anything more  let me see what uh lou in 
[03:46:30]  new york says what's up  lou hey what's up buddy  um yeah when you install  the app you could say  don't send out requests  to friends if you log in  through facebook and all  you have to do when your  five lives are gone is  delete the app and  reinstall it and just  keep going and go but  there's other things i  feel like those are the  little things like like  changing the date on your  phone installing and  reinstalling things  figuring out all these  workarounds i feel like  is when you're giving  into the addiction and  when you're just saying 
[03:47:00]  okay i give up on life  like i'm willing to  inconvenience myself to  this extent to figure out  all the little  technological ways to  cheat this game out of  giving it the 99 cents  because i'm not waiting  20 minutes for more lives  understood you know  thanks lou  all right bye later  uh adrian  hey how you doing  good  what you gonna do when  you get to when you go  to the next level you  have to take an airplane  and a train you have to  have tickets from facebook  friends to give you that  are you fucking serious 
[03:47:30]  yeah i'm stuck right now  level 35 i only got one  facebook friend that's  playing that passed that  level that's humiliating  you have to ask facebook  friends for a ticket to the  next level  yeah you gotta take a  plane or one and then  the next time is a train  oh my god  crazy stuff  i gotta get myself away  from this game if there's  anything else like  everything else angry birds  is stupid it's boring now  we've done it uh that  other pipe game that opie  was all about i beat every  level  oh this is bad 
[03:48:00]  i get you that's what it is  the pretty colors  is that what it is even for  men adrian men like you and  me  have to admit we don't like  you don't want to admit to  your friends that you play  candy crush  no i don't but it's so  addictive  and those colors are pretty  those colors are pretty  this is like candy land for  adults  right and candy land was the  shit i used to cheat at  candy land  thank you adrian i used to  cheat at candy land all day  long  you know what i would do i  would insist i'd be playing  with my mom and i would  insist that i because you 
[03:48:30]  know how candy land works  there's no die like you  don't roll anything you  just pull up a card and the  card tells you what space on  the board to go to and some  of them have colors and some  of them have little pieces of  candy  so what you really want to do  is get the card with the  piece of candy that will  take you all the way as far  as you can on the board i  mean my parents my mom when  i was playing because i  didn't have any friends  obviously not i mean who  plays candy land with their  mom even at four  however old i was my mom  had to know there was 
[03:49:00]  something up because i was  sitting there and i would be  like let me arrange the  cards and i just go every  other card piece of candy  color piece of candy color  so she'd be sitting there  like oh i got yellow i can  move two spaces and i'm  sitting there going look at  me with peppermint i guess i'm  moving halfway across the  board  it's a little schmuck but i  can't go there with candy  crush  sal do you do candy crush  uh no i don't don't start  do not start so i play like  other like stupid fucking  games it's the worst  decision i've ever made in 
[03:49:30]  my life to start this game  yeah it doesn't sound like  everyone who's calling in  seems pretty fucking  miserable they're always it's  all it does is bring pain to  your life yeah there's no  good to come of it because  you can't you you won't not  play it maybe i'll give it a  try no don't do it because i  waited so long to install this  game i see eric playing it all  fucking day exactly and that  was another thing i was like  okay this is like the type of  game that eric gets addicted  to right i'm like i'm not  gonna play this game and then  i found myself i swear to god  last week i don't know if  you were in the office cell but 
[03:50:00]  i was in the office talking  about candy crush with eric  about how great it was oh  yeah then you get to this  level and eric is like oh wait  till you see that and i'm like  no kidding you could just go on  facebook and i'm like what is  what's happened in my life you  said i turned around and he's  like i was like what the fuck  are you doing on your phone he's  like i'm sending uh sam lives i'm  like i don't even fucking want  to know what's going on see  it's nice of him because he  knows the struggle that i'm in  because i can't be asking  people i have a reputation to  uphold okay i'm a professional  broadcaster above all else i can't 
[03:50:30]  be sitting there asking people on  facebook for lives like that's  what i'll do i just say eric you  got any more lives for me buddy i  need them because like the people  on my facebook are friends that i  knew in high school and college so  i'm sitting there like sending out  a photo of me and little john and  they're thinking oh my god sam  must have this great life where  he's talking to celebrities and  really have his shit to get oh he's  just one of us asking for lives on  candy crush he's just a schmuck  higher level rank than uh sam is and 
[03:51:00]  he's chilling with old john yeah  exactly you know what's gonna  happen they're gonna realize that  i'm stuck on level 29 for however  long it's gonna take it's been a  week already i remember when uh that  that farmville shit was like  everyone was all over that shit for  a while see and i was smart i didn't  start farmville because i was like  this is stupid and i'm above this  okay i can live above the influence  this is my thing i think i can live  above the influence just like that  commercial says you don't see me 
[03:51:30]  doing all kinds of drugs you don't  see me smoking cigarettes or drinking  alcohol because i live above the  influence like you've seen that  commercial right sal yeah i live above  the influence i thought i was gonna  i'm like you know professionalism is  my anti-drug you know yeah and then i  download candy crush and i just look  like a fucking asshole after all of it  is it like one of those things you  could play like while you're taking a  shit like you could play i play it  while this show is on i play it while  opie and anthony and jim are like sam 
[03:52:00]  why don't you have this on the  computer and i'm like cuz i'm not  looking at the computer right now i'm  looking at my phone guys yes you can  play it while you're taking a shit you  could play it while opie and anthony is  on and you're supposed to be  googling stuff you could play it while  anything is happening i'm in the  studio with them it's not like i'm  eric in another room hiding now eric  plays when he's back here too i'm sure  he does i would too constantly and if  they ever call me on it you'll hear it  on the air i hope they're not  listening right now because if they  ever call me on it i'm going to tell 
[03:52:30]  them i was researching something on my  phone i'm going to tell them i was  looking up whatever they're talking  about i'm gonna be like yeah i was  just looking that up on my phone  because the computer's slow you'll  hear me say it sal this is not good  and you'll be able to call me out  and you'll say you really don't have  an addictive personality and it's  something as stupid as no i do have  i have an obsessive personality that's  why i don't do any of this stuff that's  why i never started drinking or never  started doing drugs because i'm very  obsessive look at me i can't just  watch professional wrestling on  television right i have to have  everything like i have to meet every  wrestler buy toys and do everything 
[03:53:00]  right i can't just i can't just enjoy  rob zombie's music i have to get his  logo and autograph permanently  tattooed onto my arm same thing with  jack white and i'll do it with jay-z  if that motherfucker ever comes in  this building okay i have an  obsessive personality that's why it  was a bad idea to download this  candy crush game because it's ruining  my life and it's humiliating me i'm  not really uh into it isn't it just  bejeweled right yes it's just bejeweled  that's all it is that's all it is but  it has like a really good social media 
[03:53:30]  backing i guess it's terrible social  social media backing because it  humiliates you in front of your high  school friends and then i get this  text i wish people weren't listening  usually they aren't my one friend my  my friend from high school his wife  just texted me and says candy crush  equals heroin but that's his wife who  texted me that's not him it's his wife  is she gonna send you a life now it's  the i hope so it's the game your wife  plays  not you oh man not as a man don't do it  sal do not do it i'm not gonna i'm not 
[03:54:00]  gonna listen to this guy listen to mark in  new jersey what's up mark hey sam i'm  on level 147  147 that's very impressive yeah but the  problem is once you get into the  advanced levels  there's this chocolate that grows  you see just the fact that we as men  have to have a conversation where part  of it is yeah but then you get to the  part where this chocolate grows and it's  like this is what we're talking about  and it has its own cool sound and they  change that stupid song every once in a 
[03:54:30]  while but the chocolate grows every  move you don't break the chocolate  more grows and eventually it'll  completely lock you out of the board  and you have to quit  what do you mean quit you have to quit  there's no more moves it'll say hi  you can't move anymore boom you're  done what the fuck i swear to god just  wait you'll see and you know it's  gonna happen too it's not like i'm  gonna quit this game like i should  you should do more gray hair as days go  by it's been two weeks since i've been  on this level my friends are obsessing on  it we all are we sit around and don't 
[03:55:00]  even talk to each other no laptops in  front of us and play candy crush you're  grown men and you're sitting around  playing candy crush we can't let it go  51 years old brother thank you mark  i'll punch it out thanks sam yeah my wife  is sitting there she's on the couch she's  on her computer but the reason she's on  her computer is because there's nobody  to have sex with her why because the  guy that's supposed to be having sex  with her is too busy trying to beat  level 29 of candy crush it's it's  ridiculous does she play or no no of 
[03:55:30]  course not she's above it she's far too  mature to be sucked up in stupid candy  crush she's sitting there surfing the web  being like okay i guess i'll just uh  entertain myself for a while while this  man in my life is sitting there going  playing candy crush hoping that some  facebook friend just randomly sends him  a life because he's got too much pride to  go on facebook and ask his friends for  fucking extra peppermints or whatever  goddamn things they give out i want to 
[03:56:00]  know how deep does this go do you play  this during wrestling when wrestling is  on i was playing this last night during  the pay-per-view during the pay-per-view  dude yeah the beginning of the pay-per-view  not the end of it shit but yeah i mean am  i gonna sit there and just watch a mark  henry sheamus strap match or am i gonna  have a little candy crush in there too oh my  god you know mark henry and sheamus they  have a beef right and i want to see this  beef get settled and they're settling it  in a strap match but at the same time  now i've seen these guys wrestle before 
[03:56:30]  let me add in a little candy crush here  to keep the keep keep keep the pace going  you know what i mean holy shit sam you  got you got to delete off your phone  right now and my wife is sitting there  next to me while wrestling's on the tv  and candy crush is on the phone and she's  sitting there going what is this this is  the man i believe in yeah this is to me  this is a guy that i'm counting on to be  the future of my life i want this man to  one day bear my to one day supply me with  this seed needed to bear children just as a 
[03:57:00]  fucking saint man yes she is she really  is or a glutton for punishment i can't  tell no she's just the same maybe she's  like she's a cutter but she doesn't want  to cut herself so she makes herself deal  with it like she doesn't want physical star  scars so she just creates situations for  herself with there'll be some terrible  emotional scars the twinkish husband who's  playing with fucking cell phone games  all day it's not like i'm working out  sal  dan in detroit i don't have time to work  out i'm stuck on level 29 what's up dan 
[03:57:30]  what's up sam how are you buddy i'm not  great actually how are you um  unfortunately uh i'm on level 335  i know i won't i won't play the fucking  game i'll only play it on my ipad that  way i have to stop playing it for a few  weeks because the updates the put on the  ipad for uh so long but the one thing i  can do is i can accumulate lives and like  right now i have 60 some lives that people 
[03:58:00]  give me so i can when i do play it i'll go  home at night like 9 10 o'clock and play  it uh i'll play it for a good solid hour but  i i've honestly played this fucking game  for so long that i i'll look at the clock  and say i just spent three hours of my  life i just wasted three hours of my  life playing this stupid game yeah you  think about how much you could have  accomplished in that three hours how much  could have gotten done like when you're  when you're being productive think about  how much a real productive three hours  gets done you could do a lot and that  guy was touching on the uh the chocolates 
[03:58:30]  that grow well later on because you get  bombs that you have to detonate before  they fucking go off chocolate bombs uh  no not chocolate bombs just bombs they're  just bombs you have to like you have  to you have to strategically find your  way to get these to get the candies  colored to the colored bombs that make  them so if they don't they'll they'll  blow up themselves and they'll end your  game but uh then there's stone walls  that like you know how you have the  jellies they'll have stone walls where  you gotta get like you gotta land it  three or four times on this thing then  they have cages it's it's it's fucking 
[03:59:00]  ridiculous this game it's also stupid  and i like that i like too that dan  that you said your idea of of uh of  curbing your addiction of maintaining  your own semblance of what's going on  and figuring out that okay i have to  have a life i'm only going to play on my  ipad so i'm going to beat every level  until there's just no update you know  what i mean that's a lot of time thank  you dan horrible it's become a fucking  thing in our family my mom my brother  and i we see who can get on the level 
[03:59:30]  it's just stupid so stupid when you  have conversations with your mother  about chocolate that grows it's like  what happened what happened right  all right buddy i'll talk to you later  all right take care nicole from the  morning mashup just walked in nicole  i'm sorry to bargain i just like need  some love no just hang out you know  what we're talking about i feel like  it's candy crush i don't punch you if it  is really dude yeah you don't know you  don't know the pain of candy crush  until you get to almost level 100 drop  your phone in the toilet and never save 
[04:00:00]  your game so i had to start over so now  i'm back at like 39 or 40 and so the  chocolate growing is going to be the  like the baby you're back at 39 or 40  like i didn't save the games like i was  up to like i don't know how do you save  the game i thought it just saves no so  like when i had to get a new phone after  i dropped in the toilet  how'd you drop your phone in the toilet  i was drunk of course oh of course it was  in my back pocket and i went to go pee real  quick at the bar and then as soon as i  pulled out my pants  boink there goes the phone there goes your  candy crush everything everything and i'm 
[04:00:30]  telling you the chocolate growing oh god  you're gonna you're gonna want to punch  chocolate in the face look i've been on  level 29 for a week i know i want to just  give up having a smartphone no like i'm  like maybe i just go back to having like  a motorola razor or something like that  how many times have you uh pressed the  other 99 cents yes i will order more  lives yes i think only maybe twice and i  told i was telling sal and the callers  because you know if you sign up if you do  the facebook thing if you join it then 
[04:01:00]  people on facebook can give you lives  can i tell you a secret please do okay if  you go into your settings oh my god with  the settings now go into your settings and  where you do the set time automatically  people were telling me about this but i feel  like it's like cheating it's not cheating  it's saying okay i'm letting the addiction  take over now when you'll go so far as to go  into your set like one guy was like you  know what you do if you want more lives  yeah you just uninstall candy crush on  your facebook and then reinstall it and  they give you more lives when they i go 
[04:01:30]  you just gone too far you're just giving  into the addiction at that point yeah but  i think you've already given into the  addiction if you even bought more lives  once once you press yes i will buy for  that 99 cents once first day yeah that  you gave in so what are you guys talking  about as soon as you play this thing for  more than an hour a day you're addicted  and you're worried about the logistics of  it sal hasn't started i told him don't  start it's the worst decision i've ever  made in my life got hit by a car the  other day okay there's the addiction  i was walking playing candy crush and i  mean i should use never like text and 
[04:02:00]  walk right or text to drive but you  should never ever play candy crush and  you weren't even you weren't even  inebriated no set straight up sober  after work just trying to walk home to  go walk my dog see like there's a lot of  situations i could see you nicole being  in that would result in you accidentally  getting hit by a car yeah if you if you  died by mistake at a young age yeah and  the addiction that you died of was  candy crush that would not be what you  would expect i'd be like what a waste of  time she could have gone out like with  at least having a little more fun than  trying to match up lemon candies wait 
[04:02:30]  and see there's so many different  candies coming your way you can't stop  playing no you're not going to no you  know we had a discussion last week  about this and i thought maybe after the  weekend you'd be over it and your hair  looks crazy you look like it's taking  over your life i told sal i'm sitting  there there's pro wrestling on the tv  there's candy crush in my face because  the phone's up and jess is just sitting  there next to me going like i wonder who  will have sex with me you know what i was
