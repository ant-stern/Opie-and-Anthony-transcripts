<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The E-Rock-hosted After Opie and Anthony Live show focused on a Colin Quinn birthday celebration.  A key segment featured a 2006 clip with Rich Voss and his wife, Bonnie, in studio.  Voss was discussing his repeated, unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking, sparking an unexpected in-studio appearance by Colin Quinn.  Quinn launched into a scathing rant about Voss's personality,  characterizing him as lazy and relating a car ride filled with Voss's conspiracy theories.  The ensuing discussion, involving both Quinn and Bonnie,  included numerous jokes about Voss's smoking,  his potential to start a fire due to his habit, and his general character flaws.

Following this segment, the show aired a clip of Colin Quinnâ€™s horrified reaction to watching "Two Girls, One Cup" for the first time.  Quinn's extreme disgust and repeated interruptions to overcome nausea were highlighted.

The broadcast then played a song by Colin Quinn titled "Going Back to Brooklyn," which Bob Kelly introduced. The song was universally panned as atrocious by the hosts and Kelly.  The show concluded with promotional announcements for the next day's Opie and Anthony show, featuring Jim Florentine and Sugar Ray Leonard as guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, not quite.  Sam's not here today, so my name is E-Rock  and I'll be doing After Opie and Anthony Live.  And look, I'm going to level with you. 
[00:00:30]  We're not going to do a lot of bullshit talking like Sam likes to do.  Everybody's still around.  Travis, Danny, Derek, Roland's down the hall.  I guess he ran after Opie and Anthony pitching guests.  But we're just going to focus on a lot of material today  and pretty much one main theme for After Opie and Anthony Live.  The guys didn't mention it today,  but it is our friend Colin Quinn's birthday.  So I figured, why not do the 10 o'clock hour?  We got about half an hour here.  Why not do some stuff that centers around Colin  and either being destroyed or destroying friends of the show? 
[00:01:00]  I figured that would be the best thing to do for today.  We're going to start off with a bit from 2006.  Rich Voss, one of the many times he talks about quitting smoking,  he's in studio, Bonnie's in studio.  And Colin just happened to be listening to the show at his apartment, I guess.  He's not that far from our old XM studio.  And he decided to walk in, because he had enough with Jim talking about the ways to quit smoking.  He had enough about Voss just bullshitting about how he's going to do it, 
[00:01:30]  but not really doing it.  So this is from 2006, like I said.  Rich Voss, quit smoking.  Colin Quinn is pissed.  Here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  And we have guests come in.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  I was actually...  Take his seat.  Take his seat.  Colin Quinn just ripped Voss out of his seat.  Took his headphone. 
[00:02:00]  You were raped.  That's the most exercise he's done in a month.  Colin, you picked the perfect day to stop by.  You picked the perfect day to stop by.  Get in on this.  Voss is telling us he's going to quit smoking again.  But as Colin walked in, I was thinking about Colin.  That's fucking really creepy.  That's great.  You're psychic.  Is that awful bandage on your nose?  That's from one of the girls he's dating.  Let's get Colin Quinn a mic.  We need a chair for him.  I'm surprised.  Oh, what is that?  Colin shouldn't have to stand.  You look like I'm expecting Bud Fox to save you. 
[00:02:30]  Nothing?  No, that's not bad.  LA Confidential?  Hey!  Come on!  Come on!  Just threw his breakfast on the floor.  The reason I came by, by the way.  Okay.  Are we going to have an intervention or something?  Something.  The reason I came by.  No, not anything.  It's an intervention for you two guys.  Oh, what do we do?  A little power corrupt.  Power corrupts.  Apparently, from giving this idiot a voice on the radio, he drove me home last night. 
[00:03:00]  His Toyota Caddy.  Have you seen that Camry that he calls a Caddy?  Toyota Caddy.  Camry.  Camry.  Norton.  Have you seen it?  It's the worst Cadillac ever.  It's the worst Cadillac ever.  He showed it to me.  He was like, oh, yeah.  Looks like a Camry.  So he's got the most awful GPS.  Like, you know, his crayons.  It's an eight-year-old girl.  And then, uh, so last night we're driving home, this moron goes to me, you know, I don't 
[00:03:30]  believe much in conspiracy.  He always has to deny that he believes in everything, and then he believes in it.  So you feel like he's a unique guy instead of just another, you know, strip-all idiot  like the rest of us.  I'm like, I'm not a conspiracy guy like some of these idiots.  Then he goes into this thing about the wing nuts.  We heard about it, yeah.  It was just so aggravating.  I felt like saying, you know, either do charity or learn a musical instrument.  Fucking phony bore.  It's so boring. 
[00:04:00]  It's so shitty.  I mean, if you saw these photos, he goes, give me, I'm not giving you my fucking emails  to get whipped.  Send me some shitty pictures.  Go back to porn.  At least then you were kind of excited.  You're all phony.  Instead of reading a book or taking a class, this is what dumb people do to feel intellectual.  They check out, like, the sides of planes and go, I mean, if you look at the vector,  there's some other shit.  Because some other asshole sent it to them and go, you know, this is not a 757.  Yes, it probably is, but who gives a shit? 
[00:04:30]  You boring idiot.  It was actually...  Take that thing off.  Is that a sleep apnea thing?  What else could it be?  Colin, you're on fire.  Don't sit down.  I'm not going to sit down.  He's working the room.  He's pacing back and forth and just doing some crowd work.  I think you're fat because you don't have to, you know.  Oh, my God.  We all do that, though.  We'll read all those political books and then just reciting what we just read to other people.  But I claim it's ours.  But I was honest about where I got it.  I didn't say I made it up.  I said that I found a credible source.  The gravitas in his fucking idiotic face is what got to me. 
[00:05:00]  He put the pressure on me, though, now to dispute this.  He goes, I'll send you the link, watch it, and then you tell me where the piece came from  that isn't a 757.  That's right.  Tell him to prove it.  Then you go, well, what's the motive?  I don't know.  Well, that would be part one of this argument.  But I don't know.  Tell me the motive.  Then don't bring it up until you have a motive.  Well, I don't have to have a solution.  No, a motive is different from a solution, you.  Yes, it is.  A motive is a solution as to why it happened.  Why would the government shove a plane into the Pentagon?  I don't know if they would.  Because they were waiting for the right opportunity. 
[00:05:30]  So that day when two planes went into the World Trade Center, they said, now's our chance.  Quick.  Because the ones that went into the Trade Center are legit.  It's that Pentagon one.  Yeah.  They just had it sitting there waiting for that to happen.  He raised some good points, and I had to say he raised some good points.  And you raised no good points.  I didn't say I did.  Beat it.  I really thought they were going to play it.  No bars in town.  I saw them last night.  Bring them in.  I can call it.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Well, we were talking about Rich Voss and his dumb smoking. 
[00:06:00]  He's got to stop smoking.  Yeah, why don't you just stop, stupid?  But he's almost smoked three packs a day, and I quit.  When you quit?  15 years.  Well, he won't tell us why he won't quit.  He keeps making excuses.  He's afraid.  And setting dates when he might quit.  You want to know why he won't quit?  Because I fucking smoke.  We all smoke.  Jim smoked.  He quit.  Because you're afraid to deal with the sadness and the fear and the anger that's going to  come out when you quit smoking.  You don't have something to hide behind.  Most of all, I deal with anger and fear on a daily basis. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, by lighting up five packs a day.  I know.  And the fetal position.  Oh, no.  Some use the mission of the fetal.  Do you know that fire that you were talking about in the hotel room?  Yeah.  It's directly because of your smoking, not because of her candle.  She lit a candle to stop the smoke.  That's right.  No, she was reading tarot cards.  No, that's not true.  If she was reading tarot cards, she's as crazy as you are.  She needs some more.  Were you reading tarot cards? 
[00:07:00]  Were you reading tarot cards by candlelight?  No.  I get a, you know, a scented candle.  And it's just for the...  Because it's nice.  And it's just for the smoke, right?  Yeah, it's for the smoke.  I'm a way to put myself because no one will rip it apart.  Do you make them open up the anti-suicide windows like that fraction of an ancient...  Last night I was there.  You were there puffing out there.  It doesn't work.  Blows it right back into the room.  One night I look over.  He's in bed with a cigarette asleep.  Oh, that's bad.  Oh, that's never resulted in thousands of deaths. 
[00:07:30]  Did you ever see his old apartment on the fucking floor?  It looked like little black snail trails because this fucking lazy Jew kept falling asleep  with cigarettes in his hand and dropping them on the floor.  He's not going to die from lung cancer.  He's not going to...  No, he's just going to burn up.  It's just going to take a bunch of people with him.  He's fucking...  He's sanding something and putting varnish on it.  And he falls asleep and fucking chills everyone in the house.  What's a little richie afraid of when he takes a cigarette away and there's no barriers  between him and the world?  That's right.  What is...  I'd like to know, too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, you know, it's... 
[00:08:00]  No, no, just...  I'm not afraid of anything.  What is a little richie...  You are.  It's addiction and, you know...  Right, but where does addiction come from?  Pile of ashes.  What's it come from?  It's addiction.  Would you just accept that?  It comes from...  You feel comfortable sitting there with something blocking, a big wave of smoke blocking you,  not only from the world, but from your alleged wife?  Absolutely.  Well, she's reading tarot.  She's reading tarot cards.  I'm not reading tarot cards.  By candlelight.  And tea leaves.  Yeah, she's got to read tea leaves.  It's the modern day knitting when a husband's not really... 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, these two are coming up with hobbies so they don't have to hang out with each other.  How quick did this fall apart?  This is the shortest marriage.  I want to fucking know what exactly...  Like, you are...  Everyone hides.  You hide your fear behind fucking cigarettes.  Other people hide certain failures behind a lot of food the last year and a half.  I knew it was coming.  I know.  Can I theorize something?  A great telegraph acting technique has really come here.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:09:00]  Can't wait to see Lucky Lou here.  We call it King of Queens with cursing.  Perhaps, Rich, when you started smoking, whatever it was, 20-some years ago...  When...  How long was it?  I don't know.  Okay, so a long time ago.  30-something years ago.  You needed the cigarettes because of your, whatever, your fear, your unhappiness.  And now you're addicted, but maybe you don't need the cigarettes anymore. 
[00:09:30]  You have a lovely bride.  Maybe you're better.  You should be happier now.  I'm very happy.  I got a lot...  Look what you scored, bro.  I'll tell you what it is.  Yeah, he did score big.  The problem is, you still want to think I'm Rich Voss, a teenage rebel, or an old man  a few years away from Boca.  Just admit it, and you're in the scars.  And walk around, you knew it just you could be complaining about your ills.  Old Jews don't smoke.  What's the matter with you?  I hipped you to Jews.  It's ours.  You leave my stuff alone, Noah. 
[00:10:00]  I won't touch your stuff.  But you got to stop smoking.  I'm going to.  I really know you.  There's no...  Set a date.  Just set a date.  Set a date?  Not set a date.  But don't do it for us.  You do it now.  You don't set a date.  How many times do I say I want to quit smoking?  You don't set a date.  You know what you do?  I've never heard you say that.  Where's your pack?  Huh?  Here's how you do it.  Where's your pack?  It's out in the car.  You know what...  Anthony goes...  It's on.  Anthony goes for the old school Ron Conkerman style.  Give me the pack.  Ron Conkerman.  In Anthony's families, you just see one of the uncles come out in the Bermuda shorts 
[00:10:30]  with the sandals.  Give me the pack.  He's smoking.  Give me your cigarettes.  Give me the pack.  You quit?  Yeah, you are.  Done.  But that was how he helped me quit.  He fucking...  Anthony helped me quit by the same disgust to just fucking throw the pack out.  You immediately throw it away.  And I did.  I had one more and that was just for me.  Yeah, because it's Juano or one of these people, remember?  No, no.  It was the guy with the thing on his lip jaw.  We were playing.  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  We have doctors in the studio and people would come up and get free examinations for whatever 
[00:11:00]  they got.  Something on their legs, something on their...  And this one guy had a bump on his gum line.  So the doctor put the glove on and he's feeling it.  He goes, that's a hard lump.  That's not good.  He goes, you have this checked out immediately.  He goes, you smoke?  And the guy's like, yeah.  And the guy's...  And then we start talking about how he's going to look with half a jaw.  Well, the fear on the guy is like, oh God, just tell me what it is.  Tell me what it is.  I mean, it was supposed to be a fun bit and turn it to...  Jimmy quit.  That guy...  It was horrific.  And one doctor, just to add to this, punched out. 
[00:11:30]  He's like, I don't want to be part of this.  Wow.  He saw what was in that guy's mouth and said, I'm done.  I don't want to be part of this.  The guy turned out to not have...  Right.  We found out a month later.  But when he was trying to go, the guy was like saying, all right, where should I go?  What should I do?  And watching him try to hang on to his sanity, I'm like, that is exactly what it looks like  when you find out you have mouth cancer.  I was like, that is exactly a moment.  Because the guy was trying to not panic, and that's what's freaking out.  But it was panicking him.  Okay, where do I go?  What should I do?  Who should I go to check this out? 
[00:12:00]  And if, you know, I want the best guy.  I'll never forget that day.  You ever stop smoking for a limited time because maybe you had something, you didn't know what  it was, and you're like, uh-oh.  Uh-uh.  Nothing like that.  No.  No?  No, no.  I smoked nonstop.  Just set a date, you phony.  You did quit for six months.  You did quit for six months.  I quit for six months.  What spurred that?  I was working in Boston, and I went and saw the mad Russian.  There was a guy up in Boston that everybody...  I went to that guy that didn't work for me.  You went to see, huh?  No.  He's just a douche.  He doesn't work for anybody.  No, he works for a lot.  Shut up. 
[00:12:30]  I went six months.  What's the mad Russian?  He was some, like, hypnotist guy.  You call me a flake for conspiracy theories?  Some fucking commie pushes...  Why did you throw my Aussie doll on the milk?  Oh, Jesus.  This is turning into one of the weirdest shows.  Anything we think somebody might love has to be destroyed.  That's right.  He broke my trophy on his dumb show.  That's right.  Oh, my shit. 
[00:13:00]  This fucking Aussie doll.  There's a little Aussie thing that Stalker Patty gave me, and he just ripped it up.  And, boss, oh, oh, things are going bad.  She's the only person that emails me consistently.  Who's the mad Russian?  So, Colin, when's your show on so I can be on again?  The mad Russian is this fucking flaky douche in Boston, and you sit there, and he does an  energy thing over you, and supposedly makes you quit.  Jesus.  And I'm an asshole for thinking that fucking...  It worked on my hands.  Why did you go?  It wasn't really 21 years. 
[00:13:30]  How about this?  Fuck your aunt.  She was ready to quit.  Yeah, well, if you're ready to quit, maybe that's a help.  That's really impressive.  Maybe that's a help.  Maybe that's a fucker aunt.  You should do everything you can do.  I mean, you should...  What?  Yeah, get a patch, get hypnotized, do all of it.  Do you like the smoking, Bonnie?  Everything.  I love it.  I don't want him to quit.  He subconsciously wants him to die.  What'd you do?  What'd you do to the Bonnie?  You didn't even accuse him of that, because you know he has no money.  It's a false fortune, yeah.  It's really not fun to be around somebody who's quitting smoking, and I'm not looking  for that.  How fun is he now? 
[00:14:00]  How much fun could he be?  Did you ever smoke, Bonnie?  Ever?  Yes, I did.  You did.  It took me many tries to quit.  And you quit?  Yeah, so four years.  How long ago?  Four years.  Mm-hmm.  You miss it.  Actually, at one point, before I started dating Rich, I thought I might actually start again.  It's very rough when you hook up with a smoker, and you've quit for a while, because you just  pick it right back up again.  Well, she drinks and gets high every now and then, so that was hard, too, you know.  Trade it in.  Stop trying to even it up. 
[00:14:30]  Maybe you could handle booze now.  No, I can't.  I can't.  Please.  Why don't you go to a smoker?  I know a smoker's thing next week.  Next Sunday, I'll go with you.  To a smoker's thing?  Yeah, like a smoker's meeting.  Next Sunday?  Yeah, Sunday night.  You're not working.  Stop acting like you are.  Wait, what's Sunday?  This Sunday?  Sunday coming up.  Yeah, I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  What, Sunday?  Sunday what?  What?  Between Saturday and Monday?  No good.  No good.  And Colin, as much as after that Aussie doll thing, how I really don't want to admit  this, helped me more than anybody. 
[00:15:00]  The thing he said to me, which I don't think he made up, but he said to me, the urge to  smoke will pass whether you smoke or not, and that was as perfectly simplistic as I needed.  Well, it's the same as drinking and getting off.  Shut up.  Stop trying to act like you, too, understand this.  You're still smoking, kiddies.  Rich loves to be the expert on addiction.  He'll just jump in.  Oh, please.  Listen, just switch your car. 
[00:15:30]  Look at Bobby.  Guess what?  Every guy's like that.  Hey.  No matter who you're married, you'd be miserable every time they open their mouth.  Boss, are you going to the Freedom Center?  What the fuck is the Freedom Center?  That's the laser therapy thing.  First of all, when somebody goes, what the fuck?  It's Staten Island.  I'm doing it.  Huh?  It's Staten Island.  Welcome to Freedom Laser Therapy.  What does lasers do to make you stop smoking?  Freedom from smoking addiction.  It's Staten Island.  I don't know.  They probably make a good cigarette lighter.  He's done no research.  You're going to light it up with a laser?  He's done no research on it.  None.  Someone said laser.  Someone said it to him.  Dummy thought technology easy. 
[00:16:00]  That's the future.  No problem.  They'll take out that little cell that makes me smoke.  Oh, stupid.  He thinks they're going to do some kind of brain thing.  I think it's Dave Ward-Dowell that I told you about it.  What's the gimmick here?  They don't really explain.  Oh, good.  It's vague.  It's lasers and it's vague.  Low-level laser therapy.  Hold on.  I think I had it.  You don't have to wear contacts anymore.  They use some kind of Jedi mind shit on you.  You don't need that cigarette anymore.  You have no need to smoke.  I feel great as soon as you hit Sunday when you get back in town, we'll go to a place. 
[00:16:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  We've got Tyler and Columbus.  Tyler for Rich Voss.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, you guys were just talking about that guy that had the big lump in his mouth from  years ago.  Yeah.  My father-in-law got the big casino in his jaw and about a month ago he just had it removed.  He's about, what are you, Voss, about in your 40s?  Good call.  He's 85.  What did he have?  The big what?  He's cancer.  The big casino. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  I thought he had like seizures or bounties.  No, he's, uh, actually, I had cancer in his mouth.  White.  What do you mean?  No headphones?  And, uh.  For Rich?  Not for Rich.  For Colin.  Why would there be headphones for somebody that's in studio with us?  Look.  Why?  Why would we have that?  Colin actually took a toilet paper tube to his ear and he put it to Rich's head.  It's a great photo of him.  He's hearing the sea.  Wait.  That's wacky.  That's wacky.  Wait, so he had, uh, he had his whole jaw removed, not the tumor? 
[00:17:30]  Uh, yeah.  They had to take his, uh, the cancer spread through actually the bone in his jaw.  There you go.  There you go, Voss.  All right.  Look folks in some of that, maybe.  And actually the veins and everything in his jaw and they had to remove the whole damn  thing and rebuild it.  They took like hip from, or bone from his hip and skin from his chest and legs and made  him a new jaw, but he's all.  Oh.  Hey, Voss, stop it.  Dude, this guy's telling, this guy right now.  I know.  I guess a million of these stories, if I'm not fucking ready, I know.  Yeah, by the way, caller, you know what?  During your story, Rich was checking his bookings on his Palm Pilot thing. 
[00:18:00]  No, I was trying to.  He's not even.  No, I was trying to find the quit smoking thing right here and I found the, uh, the, uh,  link, uh, website or whatever.  No, I mean, yeah.  Right next to the link to buy cigarettes online.  After ONA, it's live.  Yes, it's after Opie and Anthony live.  Sam's not here.  My name is Z-Rock, so I'm filling in for the little bit of time that we have left before  Ron and Fez start.  Are they live today?  Yes, they are live today at 11 o'clock.  I got the thumbs up.  So it's, uh, Colin Quinn's birthday. 
[00:18:30]  We're talking about Colin Quinn today and, uh, digging through some of the archives here,  trying to find some stuff that maybe we haven't played in a long, long time.  And this one came up.  It's a short bit.  When we were, we had a fascination at one point with the website, two girls, one cup.  And we were showing our comedian friends and celebrities that we could get away with it.  Uh, what they thought about two girls, one cup.  And this one features Colin Quinn on his birthday here on after Opie and Anthony live.  You haven't seen two girls, one cup yet.  Oh no. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  All right.  Roll them.  Won't even face them.  Really?  It's like a phase of you, two girls, three, one cup of, uh, soda.  This is like an internet sensation.  Where the fuck have you been?  It's a phenomenon in and on.  Stop fighting.  I only watch, I only watch the, uh, the saucy ones like, you know, that, uh, big in front  of Britney stuff.  That's good.  All right.  Here you go.  Oh, is that funny?  And we like to tape it for the internet.  So this is, uh.  I'm still trying to get Kim Kardashian, ladies and gentlemen.  This is, uh, this is two girls, one cup.  Best camera for Colin.  What is this nonsense?  Well, what do you see so far? 
[00:19:30]  It's, uh, excuse me.  I see an Indian girl and a, and a white girl and they're pulling each other, one's pulling  the top down.  That's it.  That's right.  Exposing her boobs.  Just exposing the boobs.  There you go.  Nice.  Right, Colin?  Yeah.  Very nice, actually.  All right.  Hey, what?  Oh, God.  Why did it come out the texture?  Turn, turn.  Why?  Why does it come out the texture of ice cream, though?  That's the only amazing part.  See, that's why I think it's fake.  Why don't you watch it?  Turn around.  Colin, you got to lie.  You got to lie.  Why don't you just fucking be a man? 
[00:20:00]  Colin, you got to lie.  It's making me suck.  You got to lie.  Colin.  Colin.  He's going to be sick.  Come on.  Colin.  You made us pause the tape.  Now, look at it.  Look at it.  He's going to be sick.  We're only halfway done.  Look at it.  I didn't think it would phase you.  Look at that monitor so we can get your pretty face on camera.  Right there.  There's a pail.  Just a kid to get sick.  Now, just watch the rest of it.  You have to watch.  You got past the worst part. 
[00:20:30]  It should remind you of yourself in the business.  All right.  All right.  Roll him.  All right.  Oh, God.  Now, watch it.  Colin, watch.  What are you doing?  What's going on with you?  Colin.  Stop looking away.  I'm going to throw up.  You're ruining our radio show.  We had to put pause again.  Colin.  I'm going to throw up.  No, it's great.  All right.  All right.  Here.  Let's bring it to throw up.  There you go.  She's puking the shit up.  I'm going to be normal.  Now, watch.  This is...  Now, she's puking shit into the other girl's mouth. 
[00:21:00]  She's puking shit into the other girl's mouth.  Watch.  Look at that one.  That was a gem.  She puked.  Oh, look.  They're still hungry.  The girls are still hungry, Colin.  Colin's got...  He can't get away from it.  The fucking...  The one girl ate the shit and then puked into the girl's mouth.  Oh, that's a great reaction.  How many people have thrown up from watching this?  I thought you said he wasn't going to be famous.  I thought you said he wasn't going to be famous.  I didn't think he would be.  Yeah, really, really puked.  That was disgusting to you.  And we're back here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:21:30]  That was Colin Quinn checking out Two Girls, One Cup for the first time.  It is Colin Quinn's birthday.  I don't think we said how old he is.  I don't know if he wants us to say how old he is.  But if you want to know, he is IamColinQuinn on Twitter.  You can hit him up there.  Say happy birthday and say, how fucking old are you at this point?  We got to get out of here.  Ron and Fez are going to be here at 11.  One more thing we're going to play before we end this.  This was actually a request from Bob Kelly.  He did a nice little intro for this, so we'll let Bob take out the show. 
[00:22:00]  So, for Colin Quinn's birthday, and we'll see you tomorrow with Opie and Anthony.  Jim Florentine and Sugar Ray Leonard will be on the show tomorrow, so you don't want  to miss that.  We'll be back at 6 a.m.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  What's going on?  This is Bob Kelly, and you're about to listen to the most atrocious shit on the planet Earth.  That's right.  Colin Quinn, the self-proclaimed legend.  This is what happens when you get too famous, and you actually think you can put out a song.  And you know, in some way, he actually thought this was actually legit.  He thought it was going to go double platinum back in the day when he was on MTV. 
[00:22:30]  Remote control.  Was it remote control?  Him and his, when he was thin, but his head was still big.  He had the earlobes of a fucking elephant.  And he did going back to Brooklyn.  To Brooklyn.  To Brooklyn.  Oh, I wish you went back to Brooklyn and stayed there, because this song stinks.  This should have been the end of your career, but this business sucks, and they gave you  five more chances.  So listen to this, and when you get douche shivers on the back of your neck, and you have to  pull over the car and throw up, blame fat Colin Quinn. 
[00:23:00]  Colin Quinn.  Oh, shut up.  This, right now, what you're about to listen to, is going to make you want to stab a baby  in the face.  It's the worst song you'll ever hear in your life.  So I'm serious.  Turn your radio off now.  This is Going Back to Brooklyn by Colin Quinn.  I know, I just wanted to see you guys fucking, see how long it took you.  You really do are afraid of talent, aren't you?  On the Opie.  You guys want to go, you fucking dummy, just say it! 
[00:23:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  I don't think so.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Man, I don't think so.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Crying.  Denying.  Shying.  Blow-drying.  Trying to fit in.  Going back home.  Coming back a hero.  Where the girls look like Madonna and the guys sound like De Niro. 
[00:24:00]  The top is down on that guy's T-bird and he's listening to the latest disco.  Gold earring, big chains, t-shirt, and his hair held down with Crisco.  Now his girlfriend's cute, but I can't look over, cause it might start an ugly rumor.  If he hears Bruce talk around my body, they'll throw a chore.  He's like Andrew Dice Clay, without a sense of humor. 
[00:24:30]  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  I don't think so.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Man, I don't think so.  Hit my old turf.  The place they grew the tree.  Met a girl who chewed her gum like she was castrating me.  Nails, wild. 
[00:25:00]  Clothes, wild.  She said her name was Laura.  She gave me a pair.  Started spraying her hair.  And showed me a photo of Richie Sambora.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Giving it.  Reliving it.  Forgiving it.  For all the pain it put me through.  Genuflecting.  Protecting.  Reflecting.  What am I doing here?  I haven't a clue.  I'm going back to Brooklyn. 
[00:25:30]  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  I don't think so.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Excuse me.  I don't think so.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. 
[00:26:00]  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Mine and Fez are next on the virus. </pre>
