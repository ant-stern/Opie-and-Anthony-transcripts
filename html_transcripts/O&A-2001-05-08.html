<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with lighthearted banter about Jim Brewer's reaction to AC/DC and plans to distribute "WoW" stickers at an upcoming concert.  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion about their anniversary party and the controversy surrounding access to photos on opanthony.com, with a caller and Froy, a website representative, debating the policy restricting access to attendees only.  This segued into a discussion of the WNEW.com "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" and listener accounts of their "WoW" sign appearances on Raw's War. A movie preference debate ensued, featuring titles like *Memento*, *Das Boot*, *The Usual Suspects*, *Shawshank Redemption*, and *Seven*.  The upcoming "WoW" sticker distribution road trip was heavily promoted, detailing logistical challenges and the involvement of various businesses.  A caller's offer of his girlfriend's nudity for Tool tickets, initially rejected, was later reconsidered pending a better offer. The segment concluded with an announcement of a Mother's Day contest for NSYNC and Backstreet Boys tickets and previews of upcoming discussions about a school canceling Mother's Day and overly dramatic news teases.


A significant portion of the show involved a meandering, often offensive critique of local news personalities, including Nancy Lou, Connie Chung, Katie Tong, Sheila Wang, Roz Abrams, Sue Simmons, and Lisa Hill, with stereotypical comments about their race and/or sexual orientation.  Opie also expressed his dislike for sportscasters Russ Salzberg and Angela Ray.  The discussion then shifted to a man who survived a 150-foot fall from the Williamsburg Bridge, leading to a humorous, yet unsuccessful, attempt to calculate his impact speed.  The hosts repeatedly referenced "killer teases,"  including "Eat at Your Own Risk" and "Eat Your Vegetables and Die," and continued to promote the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Studio guest Adam Ferrara participated in the banter, with references to his Olive Garden commercials.


This segment focused on brainstorming a game show concept, "Teen Weakest Link," hosted by Jim Norton, featuring teenage girls in lingerie.  The discussion involved graphic and vulgar jokes.  Callers contributed with stories about E. coli from lettuce, Rudy Giuliani's family life (featuring sexually charged and insulting comments), and personal anecdotes about parental infidelity, massage parlors, and a raid on a "body shampoo" establishment in Lodi, New Jersey.  The conversation included extended, crude discussions about sexual acts and euphemisms, a complaint about an offensive stereotype in a previous segment, and a detailed discussion of "Slap Happy" videos.  The segment concluded with promotion of the show, the whipped cream bikini contest, and Mother's Day monkeygrams.


The final segment focused on a school canceling Mother’s Day and Father’s Day due to “alternative parenting.”  The hosts, along with guests Adam Ferrera, Jim Norton, and Brother Joe, engaged in a conversation about various family structures, using highly offensive and crude language. Callers Pat and Timmy shared their experiences growing up with two dads and two adoptive mothers, respectively.  The discussion was punctuated by sexually suggestive comments, homophobic slurs, and several tangents. Brother Joe promoted his upcoming gig at Bar 9. Advertisements for ProFlowers.com and NJTOff.com were interspersed throughout.  The segment concluded with a “What Did We Learn?” segment and announcements of upcoming guests, including Johnny B from the Jerky Boys, Otto and George, and Mick Foley.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNAW, it's O, it's A, and it's ACDC.  Yeah, that was kind of cute, huh?  Cute little rhyme there, a little bit there.  Well, uh-huh.  Two for Tuesday, Ben.  What's wrong with you?  Two for.  A whole lot of Rosie and, of course, Thunderstruck.  Just laughing because every time I hear ACDC now, I think of Jim Brewer.  Brewer doing it, yeah.  Brewer ruined ACDC for me.  Yeah, because all I picture in my head is him losing his effing mind. 
[00:00:30]  And him rocking.  Right.  ACDC, of course, at the Garden tonight.  Sold-out show with Buck Cherry.  That's going to rock!  We should send someone down there to hand out WoW stickers before or after the show tonight.  Time to be fed.  That's right.  I'm back for a chopper.  I hate you crazy.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:01:00]  I've been here for seven years.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Right.  Pick your bomb and kick it off now!  She was a hoover.  Marijuana is a narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Right.  All right, we've got to get into the show.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  You know what happened quickly?  Yeah, go ahead. 
[00:01:30]  Saturday, at that party, I lost my cell phone.  You ever lose your cell phone?  I've been calling it, but no one answers.  They're not stupid enough to answer it.  But the thing is, get this now.  I think I dropped it in Big Kev's car because he was the designated driver.  So I'm waiting to just have it picked up by some poor girl that's getting ready to be chopped up.  Help me.  Help me, please.  I'm talking to the back, please. 
[00:02:00]  So, no, I really, I don't know where it is.  And I call it.  I'm just waiting to get this $2,000 phone bill.  Calls to Guatemala or something.  You know, I want to bring up something about this fine party you guys all went to Saturday.  Yeah, opanthony.com, what, they threw themselves a party, right?  Yeah, kind of an anniversary party.  Yeah.  And everyone was invited.  That was insane.  That is associated with opanthony.com.  Yes.  I'm kind of ticked off at the fine folks at the message board. 
[00:02:30]  Why?  And I'll tell you why.  Well, I couldn't make the party.  Yeah.  Nothing against you, my friend, or the people at opanthony.com, but I couldn't.  I had to get up early for a marathon.  Yes.  The next day.  We talked about that yesterday.  Now, I am a fan of the show, just like you are and everyone else is.  Sure.  You know, we're the hosts, but I'm also a fan.  Right.  I'd like to see what's going on with anything that's associated with us.  I can't view the pictures from the party. 
[00:03:00]  Well, there is a policy.  Holy S.  On the board, that only people that were at the party view the pictures.  I think we're going to have a problem, my friend.  I will get the pictures, and I will show you the pictures from the party.  The people at opanthony.com love the answer.  Mm-hmm.  I think I might have to start my own message board.  Oh, no.  There might have to be competing message boards here.  Oh, no.  Because I'm like, okay, well, I couldn't go to the party, but I would love to see what went on.  I go on opanthony.com, and I find out I'm not privileged enough to see pictures, because I wasn't there. 
[00:03:30]  That's to protect the innocent, all these pictures.  It used to be.  They're only traded now.  They're only traded amongst the people that were at the party.  There were plenty of people there.  But that's completely bogus.  That's completely against everything we believe in.  No, no.  We're all about sharing and giving stuff up for free.  No.  No one wants to be caught in a situation that might be embarrassing or something.  But it doesn't sound like that's what it was about. 
[00:04:00]  All drunk.  The message board was talking like, huking.  Look, these pictures are only for the people that were there.  Next time, pay the $10, and you'll be able to see the pictures, too.  Ah, kind of an attitude.  I'm not happy about that.  I'll show you the pictures.  Why can't they just be posted?  Because this is an anonymous thing.  People from the message board, they post.  It's under pseudonyms a lot of times.  And you just don't want your images out there. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  Look at this.  I think it's more than that.  I think there's some attitudes happening.  There's a little click going.  And if you're not part of the click, you're out.  You're out.  No, because everyone's cordially invited to the party.  And if you attend, then you get to see the picture.  A lot of people bitching on opianthony.com saying, look, I want to go.  But, you know, my kid was sick was one of the reasons.  Or I had to do this.  And you lose out.  It's one of those extra special things about being there.  Whackbag.com.  W-H-A-C-K-Bag.com. 
[00:05:00]  That hasn't been a post on there in eight months.  Oh, well.  Kind of ticked off.  Would love to see all the pictures.  The head of opianthony.com is on line seven right now.  Right.  Froy from opianthony.com.  Froy, hello.  Hello, Anthony.  Opie.  How are we doing?  Hi, Froy.  I know I'm not your favorite, but that's okay.  Oh, Opie.  I see how you kiss Anthony's ass on a daily basis on that board.  Well, that's okay.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. 
[00:05:30]  Wait a minute.  What do I do to kiss Anthony's ass?  That's okay.  Who are you on the board, Opie?  What's your name?  What's your name on the board?  I don't post on the board.  There you go.  I took time out of my day to register your name that you wanted specifically reserved.  Froy, I'm too scared to post on opianthony.com.  You guys are vicious over there.  Vicious to the newbies and you guys are brutal.  Well, they have an adopt-a-newbie program.  You can be adopted.  I'll let Anthony adopt you.  No, that's okay.  Have one of the real experienced people. 
[00:06:00]  Froy, I want to see the pictures from the party.  I don't know.  You know, there is a policy to protect, you know, people who were there from, you know...  You know what?  But that wasn't explained on the board.  It kind of sounded like, look, you know, if you didn't go to the party, it's your own problem  and you can't see the pictures now.  Anthony kind of explained it to me, so now I understand a little better.  It's nothing personal and it's not just you.  And I mean, you know, if Anthony happens to distribute these pictures, you know, he might get banned for it.  That's policy.  Rick is holding up a sign.  Who got drunk and hooked up with a fat chick? 
[00:06:30]  Who wants those pictures on there?  You know, things like that.  Yeah, exactly.  People puking.  It just made it sound on the board that, look, I'm just not privileged enough to see the pictures because I wasn't there.  Oh, Opie.  Kind of makes me, you know, feel...  Did we hurt your feelings, Opie?  No, never.  There was one guy checking in saying, look, I was there.  My wife don't know about it and I don't want her to find out.  Enough said.  There you go.  But that wasn't explained.  It made it sound like, look, you know, you have to go to the parties or you don't get to see all the fun we had. 
[00:07:00]  Well, we like to keep a little bit of an aura of mystery about it, you know, just so people feel a little bad that they didn't come.  It's like the raccoons club, Norton.  Well, it's really just to protect the people who do stupid things and make asses out of themselves.  Or people who, you know, have their pictures taken when they're half naked or puking or, you know, have their face in Mindy's breath.  Things like that.  All right.  All right.  There you go. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  That's about it.  Hey, tell Kev to check his car for my cell phone.  I will tell him.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Take it easy, man.  Bye.  Let's go to Al.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, F them on O&A message.  They're a bunch of elitist pricks.  Elitist is probably the last word I would think of.  I don't know.  You guys are, like, rubbing out all the people that aren't cool enough.  Oh, isn't it the Opie and Anthony show?  Last I checked, I think that was the name of the show.  All right?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:08:00]  So what's the deal?  They can't show you the pictures?  They're a bunch of pricks.  All right.  That's all I got to say.  You're getting people pissed off now.  Thank you, Al.  Suck it easy.  All right.  Just want to bring up an observation.  That's all.  There you go.  But much on line four.  I can show you the pics.  Oh, but I'll have to kill you.  I don't want them emailed to me.  I want to be able to see them like anyone else that didn't go to the party.  But now that you explain that there's some pictures that can get people in trouble.  Yeah.  I understand that part of it. 
[00:08:30]  I don't want to go to jail.  All right.  Enough with that.  You want to know if there's one big orgy going on at the party?  No.  It was just, it was cool.  Like I said, my brother was there.  My brother was there.  Lynch and Dina Colas showed up.  We were jamming on stage, having a great time.  Okay.  Now I'm going to get pissed.  What?  Now I'm going to get pissed.  What? 
[00:09:00]  Mr. X from Jersey.  Opie, maybe if you ever, ever supported anything that the message board did, you would be more privileged.  You tool.  Well, I don't think Mr. X is.  See, that is completely unfair, because I'll tell you right now, I've said opianthony.com probably over a thousand times in this radio show.  So if that's not supporting opianthony.com, then I don't know what is.  Oh, boy.  Who got caught being gay?  You know, who wants that on us? 
[00:09:30]  All right.  All right.  You can say Lynch.  Now to the important things.  Boobs.  Boobs, yes.  But first, Kenny, really fast.  We should get this out of the way, too.  Kenny!  Yo, what up, man?  Hey.  Yeah, did y'all see the wow signs on Raw's War yesterday?  I saw the wow signs on Raw's War last night.  Yo, they've shown them about 30 times yesterday.  The guy who had the wow sign, especially behind Jim Ross.  Yeah, that's where I saw it, yeah.  And Paul, you've got to call the show.  You've got to come down with your sign.  We're going to hook you up with some serious stuff. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  He had the chance to put it on a little bit longer, because Mick Foley was sitting right next to him.  It was unbelievable, Andy.  Yeah.  I want to ask our question.  Yeah.  Y'all coming around the city on Friday, right?  Yeah, we're going to talk about that in a little while.  Are you going to go to Queens?  Yeah, we'll be in Queens.  Like around Valley Stream?  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Valley Stream is in Queens?  Yes, I'm around there.  Yeah, on the border.  Oh, okay.  Like Green Acres Mall.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, one.  Bye.  I don't know.  We're going to figure...  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, whoever that kid is who had the wow sign behind Jim Ross, holy S, call the show, 
[00:10:30]  bring the sign down.  We will totally hook you up.  We love when that happens.  I think everyone knows that, right, Ant?  Mm-hmm.  You get the wow signs and the O&A signs on live TV.  Yeah.  And we hook you up with whatever you want.  Whatever we have that we can give you, we'll give.  What is this?  Where is it?  Well, I missed it, but I was reading a bunch of emails before the show.  I guess Jim Ross, it was on so much.  And it was such a distraction that Jim kind of turned around and commented and said something  about, I guess there's some kind of promotion going on here tonight or something.  I guess there's some kind of promotion going on. 
[00:11:00]  Why?  I don't know what that means.  That's what I'm getting from the emails, but if anyone else has details on that, please  call the show and let me know.  Yes.  But it was very cool, and you deserve a prize for that.  Thank you very much.  Did not go unnoticed last night.  Nice.  All right.  Okay, yeah.  Now we can finally get to boobs, Anthony.  Sorry about that.  All right.  I am punching up WNEW.com right now.  Yesterday, we had 13 finalists in the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Uh-huh.  Grand prize will be a trip to Hawaii. 
[00:11:30]  We lost three girls overnight.  What's wrong?  I thought she was out.  Oh.  And this one was in.  Wait, turn around.  Did I screw up?  Yeah.  Look.  Here.  Right.  Is she out?  Yeah.  And she's in?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  By like two votes.  Oh, it changed right at the last minute?  Yeah.  No, that's accurate.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Someone, uh... 
[00:12:00]  I swear, yeah, it's accurate.  It changed as 3 o'clock hit.  Oh, my God.  Basically, what happens is we had 13 finalists yesterday.  We're down to 10 today.  We had three girls that, you know, the three girls that had the least amount of votes were  knocked out of the competition.  Yeah.  And basically, you could vote right up until 3 o'clock.  And yeah, you're right.  We had three girls, but the one girl made it, and another girl got knocked out at the  last second.  It was that close.  All right, the three that have been eliminated by your votes are as follows. 
[00:12:30]  Laura is out.  Savannah is out.  I really like Savannah.  Yeah.  She was a personal favorite.  And, uh...  Madison is out.  Madison from Privilege, Gentleman's Club.  Yeah.  That's a big surprise, too.  So, uh, yeah, Laura, Savannah, Madison, out.  Out.  All the rest of the girls that were picked as a finalist, uh, eager and willing to take 
[00:13:00]  your votes.  That's right.  Now we're down to 10 girls, Anthony.  10 girls.  So now all the people that voted for, uh, you know, those three girls are going to have  to decide who they like now from the remaining 10, uh, finalists.  Uh, this contest is easy.  Basically, you just got to vote every day.  Yeah.  At www.com, foundrymusic.com.  As the week goes on, the girls with the least amount of votes are just, you know, eliminated  from the contest until we finally get a grand prize winner for the trip to Hawaii.  Okay?  You vote for your favorite girl.  Favorite girl.  www.com, foundrymusic.com, f-o-u-n-d-r-y music dot com. 
[00:13:30]  How does the voting look?  Is it, uh, are there some people that look like they're doing very well?  Is it very close without mentioning any name?  There's, right, right now there's one, two, three girls that can win it.  Three girls that are looking very good.  But the other one's very close race.  Right.  Uh, as far as the other girls are concerned.  But as we eliminate more girls, I mean, we've seen that the voting can drastically change. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Drastically change.  Of course.  So, what's going to happen?  We've got ten girls today, Anthony?  Yeah.  By showtime tomorrow, we're going to eliminate another two.  Another two.  So then whoever was voting for those girls now have to put their votes to someone else.  Right.  And it could change the voting pattern.  And still vote for your favorite.  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  You have to vote every day.  I haven't voted yet today.  I'm saving my vote.  Oh, you're saving your vote?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  By the way, the websites are getting pounded. 
[00:14:30]  A lot of people bitched because I guess FoundryMusic.com was down last night a little bit.  It's just getting crazy traffic.  So, please be patient.  Yes.  You know.  As soon as we mention the websites, we're crashing them.  So, you know, just make a mental note and vote later if you have to.  Okay?  All right.  Paul, you're next on WNEW.  Paul.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  You guys rule, man.  All right.  Hey, I wanted to tell you about that sign with the wow last night on Raw. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened was Mick Foley was coming.  Jim Ross turned around when they had the camera on him and they were going to, like, you know,  Jim Ross was, like, waiting for Mick Foley to come out of the audience.  And when he came, when he turned around, he said, oh, we got some kind of radio promotion  going on here.  And then that's when Mick Foley jumped over the fence.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  So, you got good exposure.  We got huge exposure last night.  And we're going to hook up that guy with some great stuff for doing that for us.  Yeah, it's cool. 
[00:15:30]  Thanks, Paul.  No problem.  All right.  Now this guy, Ted, on line nine, is claiming he was the guy.  Ted, what's up?  How you doing?  Oh, by the way, yeah, you're right, Rick.  Mick Foley in studio Thursday at 3.30.  Ted, go.  Yeah, I'm the one that had the wow sign last night.  Behind Jim Ross?  Yep.  The yellow one with the red lettering?  Yeah.  Yep.  I actually had two of them.  Did you have a pink sign, too?  That was, my daughter was next to me about Regal of being a queen.  Yeah.  Yep.  Okay.  You still have the sign?  Oh, yeah.  Come on down.  We're going to give you some great stuff. 
[00:16:00]  Okay.  My son's all crazy now.  He's listening inside.  Where do you live?  Garden City Park, Long Island.  Can he come down?  Not today, no.  All right.  Well, just show up anytime while we're on the air.  We're going to hook you up with some great stuff.  Okay, great.  And if for some reason you can't make it here, I don't know, we'll mail you something.  No, I can mail.  I can make it in.  Yeah, but it's cool to come down.  You come down with the sign, you know, we'll talk to you on the radio a little bit, and we'll give you  some great stuff, all right?  Sounds good.  Thank you, Ted.  Thanks a lot.  Just show up anytime between 3 and 7 the rest of the week.  Okay, great.  All right, man.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Nice. 
[00:16:30]  What's wrong?  I'm trying to realize it.  I'm trying to...  Is this guy for real?  He goes, maybe it's the fact that the girls' pictures are in...  Do you think the fact that the three eliminated were black and white is a coincidence or some  bias of your simple listeners?  Now, if you look at the finalists, you will see three girls, Laura, Savannah, and Madison 
[00:17:00]  eliminated.  They have a red X through their pictures.  Right.  As Foundry Music does this, or as Scott Columbo does this, he changes the picture from color  to black and white after they're eliminated.  Just so there's no confusion.  And the only reason I'm wondering if this guy was for real or joking is you would have  to be so incredibly stupid to not realize that.  Okay.  Yeah.  As the girls are eliminated, they're going to go into black and white mode with a red X 
[00:17:30]  through the whole picture.  Probably thought the Xs were there, too.  Yeah.  You know, you shouldn't taint the competition by putting Xs over chicks' faces.  That's funny.  Let's go to Sal.  Sal, what's up?  Hey, Sal.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Anthony?  Hey.  Dude, I went to go see Memento last night.  Memento, yeah.  F-ing blew my mind. 
[00:18:00]  That's a great movie, isn't it?  That movie was great.  It's the best movie I've seen in a really long time.  I'm telling you, the listeners have to go see that.  Screw the Mummy, because I saw that, and that was good.  But if you want a movie that'll, like, make you think, I was sitting at home last night  thinking about it.  I don't like thinking.  You like thinking.  It makes my head hurt.  No, it's not a special effects, you know, type of movie.  It makes you think.  There's not many sets. 
[00:18:30]  Not many characters.  Ooh, stop.  I might leave the show to go check it out, the way you're describing it.  It sucks.  What happened to you, Ed?  What?  I love the action movies.  You like other movies, too.  Like?  I don't know.  I've always...  You don't like a thinking man's movie?  Um, there are a couple, I guess.  I'd be hard-pressed to really search them out right now.  Name a thinking man's movie you've seen that you enjoy, that had nothing to do with special 
[00:19:00]  effects, maybe didn't even have a star.  A star in it.  Not the Matrix.  The Matrix count?  I love that move when they do that.  I think it's called the Matrix move.  What kind of coincidence is that?  Uh, I can't...  What?  Jaws?  No, that's a little...  A thinking man's movie, just based on complete storyline.  That's a really good story.  No special effects, really.  Right.  You have to be a big star.  Boy, I'm shallow.  I love it.  Bridges of Madison County? 
[00:19:30]  No.  I wish I fell asleep three times on three different occasions.  Right.  For some reason, trying to watch.  Well, Sal, cool.  I'm glad you enjoyed the movie.  Yeah, thanks a lot for opening my eyes to that.  Everyone should go see it.  I'm serious.  I don't even know if it's...  I had to go to, like, the Huntington Arts Cinema to see it.  It's not even in regular theaters, I don't think, is it?  I had to go see it in a clear view.  Yeah.  Like, all the way, like, two towns away from where I live.  Right.  Rick's wife brought Rick's mom, and she didn't get it.  She hated it. 
[00:20:00]  No?  All right.  Thanks, Sal.  All right, man.  Bye.  You know what one of my favorite movies is?  And it was kind of...  But there's some action in there.  A lot of action.  No, there's nothing...  Das Boot.  You ever see that one?  I never saw Das Boot.  It's a great movie.  World War II German U-Boat.  And all the people in it, and the story behind all that depth charges going off and whatnot.  I can't think of...  Boy, I guess I'm just shallow. 
[00:20:30]  The Usual Suspects.  That was a good movie.  Great movie.  Not a lot of action in that.  Kaiser Sose.  Mm-hmm.  He was dead the whole time.  He was dead the whole time.  Don't ruin the end of that one.  All right.  Oh, let's see.  Mafia.  It was a great thinking man's movie.  Jay Moore.  Yeah, you were thinking...  I was thinking, how did Jay accept this?  What about Brian?  Brian's got a good one. 
[00:21:00]  Like Shawshank Redemption.  That was a great movie.  That was a great movie.  Good story.  Yeah.  Not a lot of action, but some good killing too, you know?  Good movie.  Yeah.  Doesn't mean it has to be, you know, violence-free.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Good movie.  Huh.  American Beauty.  A lot of action in that.  Wow.  American Beauty was a really good story.  Loved the killing.  All right.  Unbreakable.  Unbreakable.  That was a...  Whoa. 
[00:21:30]  No thinking man's movie.  And they're going to make...  They're going to shove two more of those down our trots.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the concept of that was kind of cool.  Wait, you finally saw Unbreakable, right?  Yeah.  The concept of it was cool.  An ordinary guy who turns out to be some kind of superhero.  Right.  But the way it was done was, oh my God, that movie was slow.  Oh.  They should have had more of a...  Slower than a mongoloid.  They should have had more of Bruce Willis kind of, you know, bumping into people and seeing how, you know, what's...  You know what I mean?  And then going and doing something about it. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Like he did with the little family that was tied up.  Right, right, right.  Like that was cool.  Right.  That was the only good part of that movie.  They only had one of those scenes.  They could have had three or four of those.  Maybe in the sequels.  Freddy Got Fingered.  There's a Thinking Man's movie.  Oh, God.  Joe Durf.  Here's one.  And I know you like this movie.  Dennis.  Yeah.  Ultimate Thinking Man's movie was Reservoir Dogs.  That was a great story.  I mean, if you really look at it, everything happened like off camera.  Nothing happened while you were watching.  Right. 
[00:22:30]  As long as you guys were talking.  How about like a Pulp Fiction?  Believe it or not, that's...  Pulp Fiction.  That's great.  Exactly.  But that had, you know, some nice violence, too.  It's punctuated by brief moments of action, but you're right.  But Unbreakable, who liked that one?  I hated that.  I was so pissed when I left the theater.  I was like, let's make a superhero movie very, very, very slow.  No one pisses me off about a movie like Unbreakable, and it happens a lot in Hollywood.  What's that?  You leave the theater going, wow, what a great concept for a movie.  Yeah.  That was cool.  Like, it was a little different.  It wasn't like the same type of thing you see over and over again. 
[00:23:00]  But then you're like, but they didn't hammer it on.  They made the wrong choices someplace.  It happens a lot.  But you sit there, and you're like, this is a great idea.  That could have been huge.  Yeah.  And they ruined it.  Well, maybe it'll be better when they do it again.  And Seven.  Bobby from Jersey, the movie Seven.  Seven was a great movie.  Twisted.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Good.  Listeners bailed me out.  Tommy?  How do they know what movies I've seen?  Well, it's all the movies that every guy's seen. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Tommy's got another good one on Line 3, L.A. Confidential.  Yeah, that was good.  That was good with a really good story.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Enough of that.  Things to do in Denver when you're dead.  That was a good movie.  I didn't see that one.  Oh, God damn, dude.  You've got to rent that one.  Who was in that?  Oh, there was a bunch of people in it.  Yeah.  Ensemble.  Rick, I don't mean to treat you like, you know, you're working for another station.  So here.  Christopher Walken.  I want to give you a mic.  Yeah, Walken was in there.  Walken was in there, too. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, awesome.  Rick, you've got to get on mic.  So we give our people full mic power at this radio station.  How's banked?  Jaws 4.  All right, see, now I'm turning your mic off.  Now you're relegated back to the box.  Yeah, awesome.  Now you're going to have to scream for the rest of the show.  That was just stupid.  It's only one reason why you wouldn't get full mic power, because what you have to say  is not really important. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, they dump out of that movie title real quick.  The fantasy movie.  Science fiction.  Please, give me a break.  Exhibit A.  God damn.  You know, can anyone say, jump the shark?  Like, we were talking about this the other day, and I definitely don't want to get into  it.  Although, we might get into it a little with Giuliani's problem that he's having with his  wife. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  As far as...  Look, I can't even talk anymore.  But as far as divorces go, if your ex-wife can bring a motion picture in as evidence to  show, how she contributed to your career, you are so assed.  God damn.  I don't know what you're talking about.  That's brutal.  You're talking about movies now, divorce, movies.  Yeah, wow.  I don't know where you're going with that.  Andy Garcia was in Things to Do in Denver.  Very good.  Great.  Quick break. 
[00:25:30]  Anthony will be back.  But basically, today, guys, you've got a job to do.  Keep voting for your favorite whipped cream bikini lady on WNAW.com, FoundryMusic.com.  You've got to vote every day.  Very important.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  Oh, wow.  O.P.  What did you learn on the show today?  Really not too much, sir.  Not anything useful, anyway.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned absolutely nothing.  I actually lost brain cells today.  What did you learn on the show today? 
[00:26:00]  What I learned today, this bit still sucks.  The O.P.  Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Sam Adams, we love it.  Yes, we do.  Sam Adams continues to show the world how great American beer can be by winning awards in several  recent international beer competitions.  Sam Adams' passion and independence in brewing continue to set it apart from the other beers  of the world.  Show your support for independent thinking everywhere. 
[00:26:30]  Have a Sam and judge for yourself what a world-class beer should be.  I love that drink.  Sam just won, get this, beer of the year at the Helsinki Beer Festival in Finland.  Wouldn't you love to go to the Helsinki Beer Festival in Finland?  That's got to be a par-tay.  Five gold medals at the New Zealand International Beer Awards and two gold medals at the International  Beer Competition in London, England.  All won by Sam Adams.  Sam sold in 19 countries around the world. 
[00:27:00]  Sam has won more than 200 international awards in the last 21 or two and a half years.  21 and a half years?  Yeah, just to jump in real fast, two and a half years, I think.  Ah, there you go.  When we were broadcasting live from Boston last summer, he had all his awards on display.  It was insane.  The guy, he's passionate about beer.  It was insane how many trophies he had.  And it shows, yeah, more than 200 international awards in the last two and a half years.  More than any other beer on the planet and more than any other beer in history. 
[00:27:30]  You know, the awards are great and it's wonderful to be able to say you won all these awards.  But the bottom line, we drink it, we love it.  Sam Adams.  Get one right now.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.R.N.Y.  Out of country.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O&A Show.  212-757-1027 is our phone number if you have anything for this mess. 
[00:28:00]  Speaking of the Black Crows, Anthony.  Their new CD is out today.  Lions getting great reviews.  The Post giving it three and a half stars today.  And you know how we like to talk about Napster and all that?  Yeah.  And you know how we've had discussions about Napster and the reason why we're downloading  all the music for free and stuff, or were, because now it's really become a pain in the 
[00:28:30]  ass, is because, you know, the record company's been getting away with murder for all these  years.  Those are high-priced CDs.  High-priced CDs.  And we've discussed this and said, look, the record company needs to get a little more  creative with their new releases.  That would help this situation.  You know what I mean?  Give something you can't get by just downloading it off the web.  Because they're like, yeah, we can't compete with people downloading this stuff for free.  And we said, well, that's not completely true.  You give us some extra stuff when we go to the record store to buy these CDs, and we're 
[00:29:00]  going to be happy again.  Right.  Well, the Black Crows, the new CD.  They are trying, my friend.  In the review, it says, hats off to the Crows for their innovative use of the Internet in  conjunction with this release, Lions.  With the CD, you get an Internet access code to view and listen to a webcast of any show  on the band-supporting tour.  Oh.  So you get to check them out live on your home computer.  You can also download one complete concert. 
[00:29:30]  So you get some live Crows.  And you can download that concert off of Napster.  And you don't have to buy the, you know.  You're probably right about that.  And to, at least they're trying, though.  And to snag, and you can snag a single song, concert, highlights that will last 30 days on  a hard drive.  Last 30 days on a hard drive.  That's interesting.  Well, at least we're, you know, they're at least trying and starting to give us some extras  when we go to the record store is what I'm getting at.  Little something extra. 
[00:30:00]  There's still snags in the whole system.  We understand that.  But eventually, you know, they'll probably give us so much stuff.  We could justify spending the outrageous prices for new scenes.  That, speaking of Chris Robinson, did you see him on The Daily Show last night?  I missed it.  I heard Jon Stewart was out of touch.  Jon Stewart, man.  Didn't really know much about the band.  Got the drummer wrong.  Yeah, got the drummer wrong.  And then he was pretty much just bashing Chris Robinson, saying like, you know, oh, well, 
[00:30:30]  your wife is on a better show right now, kind of goofing on himself.  And then he sneaks in like being funnier or something.  Like he didn't think Chris was being funny enough.  Chris is a very funny guy.  And then saying how he goes, you know, what it is with guys like you and me, you know,  we're ugly and but we, you know, we get nice looking girls.  And you know something, Chris, we're going to be ugly in 30 years.  We're still going to be ugly. 
[00:31:00]  And but the people that are chicks and stuff will be ugly, too.  Like, but it's like, Jon, where are you going with this?  He was on vacation, I guess last week.  And I love The Daily Show.  Stephen Colbert was was guest hosting for him.  That guy's effing hysterical.  He is so damn funny.  I'm watching the show last week laughing my ass off.  And Jon Stewart gets back.  And lately, I've noticed, man, Jon has just been getting like he's got an attitude almost.  And he's he's not coming off like he used to. 
[00:31:30]  A little problem.  Somebody thinks he's got to ground Jon again.  Got to sit him down a little intervention.  Because he's starting to lose that that kind of cool dirt bag thing he had going.  Dirt bag thing.  Yeah.  Remember that?  He got, for the love of God, he used to come on this friggin show.  Yeah.  He got too big for us.  You know, you start hosting some award shows and sitting with the big stars and everything.  It's over, Jon.  You know what sucks about radio? 
[00:32:00]  We get the people on the way up and we get the people on the way down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No in between with this radio show.  And then he's barely on his own show anymore.  Which I don't mind.  Like I said, when Stephen Colbert sits in, Stephen can't do an interview to save his life.  I was going to say, I got to play the other side of that.  The guy's interviewing skills are.  But you know something?  I don't watch the show for the interviews.  The interviews last, what, five minutes?  And I'd rather watch Stephen Colbert in an uncomfortable interview situation than watch Jon Stewart in that interview he did with Chris Robinson last night. 
[00:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  It just blew.  And the whole show, like when he's doing headlines, it doesn't come off like it used to for some reason.  But then when Stephen Colbert was doing it, it was funny.  I don't get it.  Jon better get it.  Jon.  Jon, re-evaluate yourself.  You're obsessed with this, aren't you?  Get yourself grounded.  I enjoy the program, Opie.  Because I remember you were also pissed at Jon for kissing Bob Costas' ass.  Well, yeah.  Bob Costas comes in after the Vince interview that he did. 
[00:33:00]  And he's sitting there with, you know, three days of thinking after the interview.  Now he's got the witty comebacks for Vince three days later on Jon Stewart's show.  And Jon is just talking about Vince and the XFL and the WWF like, oh, it's so far above that.  And it wasn't the sarcasm that would be cool, you know, if you throw that in.  Because we always do that.  Always bashing the WWF and stuff. 
[00:33:30]  But it's with some sarcasm to him.  But he's sitting there with Costas just like, oh, imagine the trolls that watch that programming.  And he's serious.  Hey, turn that down, God damn it.  Lee, you're on the radio.  Turn down your radio.  Sorry about that.  All right.  Lee's a girl?  Mm-hmm.  All right, Lee.  What's up, Lee?  No, but I was watching my same episode last night.  And Chris Robinson, he was trying to give it back to Jon.  Oh, I know.  He was trying to give it right back to him.  Like, cutting on him because he hosts the cable TV show. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Well, Chris Robinson can hang.  Yeah, absolutely.  He has no problem hanging and getting into it.  It didn't seem like it was all fun, you know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Like, Jon had some kind of, I don't know, kind of like an attitude.  Yeah, he's not the same since he got back from vacation.  All right.  He used to be funny.  Thank you, Lee.  No problem.  Taking time off to make movies and stuff.  You know?  I guess that's what he's doing.  Setting up his next award show.  You want us to call Jon for you, Anthony?  Yeah.  So we can discuss this with him? 
[00:34:30]  Well, that Bob Costas thing did not sit well with me.  Believe me.  Yeah.  He's got problems.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  Oh, Doug.  What's up?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  You going to ever kiss Stephanie McMahon again after what happened last night?  I did see that.  I didn't watch Raw's War all night long, but I guess I saw some of the highlights.  I tuned in, Ant.  Yeah.  And Rikishi, I know what Doug's going to say here.  Rikishi was giving the lovely and talented Stephanie McMahon the stink face like I've never 
[00:35:00]  seen the stink face before.  Oh, no.  She was up there.  She was in there and up to her ears.  Stop it.  Was it the serious stink face?  Anthony, Stephanie, what a trooper.  She went the distance.  Her head.  It wasn't one of those where she turns her head.  No.  Her head almost disappeared completely.  Holy Jesus.  Yep.  Now it's just a handshake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just, yeah.  If Stephanie's listening, do not go for the kiss anymore.  If Stephanie not now, not the balloon not anymore.  You told her, too.  And next time, it's going to be a kiss hello. 
[00:35:30]  No.  No questions asked.  No.  Now she's going to go for the kiss.  No.  And you're going to go, hey, how you doing?  Not after where that face has been, uh, Miss McMahon.  Oh.  It was pretty disgusting.  I was thinking about that, too.  There's Rikishi.  That's his move.  The stink face, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, if you don't know who Rikishi is in the WWF.  Big, fat Samoan.  He's got to be, what, 400 pounds?  His, his ass, there's a famous saying, but his ass looks like he's been sitting in a  gravel drive, uh, you know, uh, gravel drive, uh, driveway for hours. 
[00:36:00]  Sorry.  Like on Lava Rock.  Right.  On Hawaii or something.  Right.  Just disgusting.  Yeah.  I mean, it just, it's all cellulite.  Oh, it's disgusting.  And he shoves, uh, this ass in, in people's faces while he's pretty much wearing a thong.  Yeah.  More or less.  And people's face go, like, right in there.  Yeah.  Ugh.  But I was thinking, I'm like, does the guy shower just before his match, make sure it's  nice and clean?  And you got to think, the boss is daughter.  What if you're going to give her the stink face?  You, like, use Brillo. 
[00:36:30]  What if he got the cranky ass working or something?  Oh, Jesus.  And something tells me he could shower, but the walk down the ramp would work up cranky  ass on him.  Right, right.  You got a sample.  Big, fat Samoan cranky ass.  Got the rotting ass.  Ugh.  It's worse than a dirty penny, Rick.  Rick's saying it tastes like a dirty penny.  How would you know?  Rakeshi's ass tastes like a dirty penny.  Way to go, Rick.  Yeah, Doug, we saw that, though.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Let's move on here. 
[00:37:00]  212-757-1027.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, you guys got to come down to South Queens on Friday.  Okay.  We've got a heavy contingent of people that listen down here.  We had a meeting today.  We should discuss what's going to happen Friday.  We're taking the show on the road.  We're going to look like the war room in our office.  We've got a map hanging up on the wall.  People, like, toiling over the map with highlighters, trying to figure out a route to take.  Yeah, if you weren't listening yesterday, basically we have decided that we want to hand out 100,000  WOW stickers. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  On Friday.  So we're renting, like, a tour bus.  It's a tour bus.  It's going to be kind of like a caravan.  And there's a guy that wants to give out what?  Ben, grab the mic.  Because it started out as we're just going to get on a tour bus with all these stickers  and we're going to stop, you know, in Long Island, Jersey, Staten Island, Brooklyn, you know, everywhere.  We're going everywhere.  Right.  And jump out of the bus and hand out stickers and move on.  Now there are people that want to join us.  They want to join us.  Some people just have some fun and hang out. 
[00:38:00]  Now, it's just going to be show people in the bus.  But people still want to follow in their cars.  Right.  Something, we get a caravan going, that's fine.  But now, instead of just civilians and listeners wanting to follow,  now people are just trying to work their businesses in.  Yeah.  People are realizing there's a good opportunity for, yes, exactly, their business.  I guess we're going to have some brand new Corvettes helping us out.  Corvettes will be flanking us like escort fighters.  Yes.  All right.  And then Ben got a call today from Jimmy's Italian Ice, I think in Brooklyn or something 
[00:38:30]  like that.  Jimmy's Italian Ice.  And what does Jimmy's Italian Ice want to do?  He wants to drive behind and hand out free samples along the route.  A tick.  Like a tick on a dog.  They want to get on the bandwagon like a leech and just hang on and try to, like those  fishes that follow the whale.  The pilot fish on the shark.  Thank you.  Stay under the shark's mouth hoping that some pieces of fish that flake off, they want to  nibble at the plankton. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, my God.  It's going to be an event Friday.  We're going to attempt to broadcast the whole show.  You want hot dog?  From the tour bus.  The guy's pushing a hot dog wagon 60 miles an hour down the road.  Hot dog.  Pretzel.  No potato.  Too early.  We're going to start at noon on Friday.  Yeah.  We're leaving the station at noon on this tour bus.  The tour bus looks sweet.  Oh, yeah.  And we're going to head rock stars for the day.  We're going to head straight down Broadway. 
[00:39:30]  Then we're going to Brooklyn, Staten Island, Jersey City.  We're going to get up to Bergen, like the Hackensack area, kind of.  Then we're going to jump across to George Washington.  Then we're going to do like New Rochelle and Yonkers.  Yeah.  Around there.  And then we're going to head down 95 to somewhere in Queens after we go over the Whitestone, I  guess.  Yeah.  And then we're going to head out to Long Island, do some fun in Nassau County.  Suffolk County.  We're not going to make it this time. 
[00:40:00]  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Can't quite make it out there.  And then we're going to, on the way back from Nassau, we're going to hit Queens again  and back into the city.  All day.  All day.  Just broadcasting live, handing out stickers and saying hi to everyone.  Noon until 7.  We're on tour giving away WOW stickers.  We're going to have like, yeah, but we're going to have more than that.  We're going to have shirts and stuff to give away wherever we go.  And hopefully by showtime tomorrow on all the websites, we're going to have specific places  we're going to be.  We are going to be here in Northburg and we're going to be here in Nassau County.  So we can have a little welcoming crew. 
[00:40:30]  And then on the way, we'll be handing them out as well.  Yeah.  You know, if we're at a light or stuck in traffic, we'll jump out and hand them to everyone  around us.  Fabulous.  Should be fun.  Should make for some interesting radio Friday.  So it freaked out Pete, the engineer, who's now a radio star.  Pete was in the office talking about stuff.  I don't know what the hell he was talking about because we're going to have to figure out some  way to broadcast from this bus or from the places that we stop.  And of course, we need Pete's expertise. 
[00:41:00]  So Pete comes into the office talking about some kind of broadcasting equipment that we'll  need and trying to get the bugs out of it.  Then he looks at his watch and realizes, it's our coffee time.  Why are you scheduling a meeting during our two o'clock coffee time?  And then his coffee buddies come in and start going, Pete, what are you doing?  It's coffee time.  Like they're freaking out that Pete isn't back there like he's been every two o'clock forever. 
[00:41:30]  You know, I love those guys.  They've been with the company for who knows.  Pete's working on 40 years or something.  44, I think.  44 years.  44 years with this company.  And the rest of the guys aren't too far behind.  And they sit around like a bunch of old ladies gossiping and stuff, talking about the old  days, sipping on their coffee for an hour.  Every day.  What is that 44 years ago?  What year is that?  That's 57.  1957?  Hold it.  Was there FM radio back then?  No.  No, no, no.  He worked at NEW AM. 
[00:42:00]  The AM.  When it was all chicks?  The chick lineup?  I remember that.  Oh, my gosh.  Or reading about that, I should say.  Yeah.  The whole lineup was, what, female talk show hosts or something?  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-bang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang.  I love this music.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-bang-a-dang.  I was explaining how a Marty works.  And I'm like, we don't care how it works.  Just get it done for us, please.  Pete started working here before, like, oh, before we were even doing anything in space.  God, Doug is on the same wavelength as us. 
[00:42:30]  Doug.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  How you doing?  All right.  Say what you have to say.  Yeah, my friend just got signed by Cy Records.  Uh-huh.  And I was wondering if you guys want to throw him on the bus.  Yeah.  We actually were goofing with Pete, saying, Pete, there's going to be a live band.  Right.  We're getting a flatbed truck to follow the bus.  Right.  And, uh, who'd you say?  You said it was Limp Bizkit.  Yeah.  He had no clue.  And the Stones are going to play a set, too.  Right.  And Pete's like, why do you come to me with this now? 
[00:43:00]  Right.  You come to me a couple of weeks in advance.  No, a month in advance.  Like, Pete.  Pete, I thought with the Stones you're playing.  It's the Stones and Limp Bizkit following our caravan.  Our little road trip thing we're doing.  It's coffee time.  Right.  And we had to bribe him with the cheesecake.  Yeah.  He goes, so, uh, this Limp Bizkit, will they have their own equipment?  Yeah.  They have their own equipment, Pete.  It's Limp Bizkit.  All right.  So...  I don't know. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Right.  So then he's discussing all this stuff that we have no business, you know, knowing about.  So we just, we started the chant.  It's the new thing around the station.  Yeah.  When we get, uh, you know, a little frustrated and confused, we just start with the chant.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Nothing works here.  Medication doesn't work.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:44:00]  I've been here for seven years.  Coffee time.  I'm missing my coffee.  All right.  So we'll have details on that by showtime tomorrow.  We'll have the route figured out, where we're going to be, and all that.  Yeah.  All right.  We gave the staff 24 hours to figure this out for us.  Coming to an area near you.  It should be a lot of fun.  It's like Rain Man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We'll be taking video and snapshots.  We'll put them all up on the website.  Oh, it's going to be a rolling party, and we'll see if this bus gets arrested.  Yeah.  I guess Sam Adams already came through with a ton of beer. 
[00:44:30]  All right, guys.  Nice.  Mark.  What, Mark?  Mark.  Hello?  Why are you saying, come on, guys?  It's your problem.  Oh, I didn't know.  I was wrong.  Yo, my girlfriend wants to come down and get naked.  Look, he's all just aggravated.  Why are you aggravated?  He doesn't care what we're talking about.  He's just like, come on, guys.  Enough of the crap.  Get to me.  Get to me.  I'm waiting here.  It's all about me.  So what do you have that's so important?  Dude, my girlfriend's gorgeous.  She wants to come down and get naked for you guys for tool tickets.  She looks like Patricia Kostas with a better ass than Jennifer Lopez. 
[00:45:00]  Well, that's not hard to do.  Jennifer Lopez actually does not have that good an ass.  Oh, I agree, but this girl's ass is phenomenal, dude.  Mark, usually I would say, well, come on down, but, I mean, we saw so much nakedness  the last two weeks.  Not that I don't want to see your girlfriend naked, but for tool tickets?  We're going to need something a little more.  Something a little more.  You tell me it's done, but I'm telling you, you've never seen anything like this in my  life.  I don't know how I got it.  Mark, let me tell you something. 
[00:45:30]  I know we could get you tool tickets, but the nakedness, it's got to go, it's got to be  better than that.  Yeah.  What do you want?  You tell me, we'll do it.  You figure it out.  No, we hate when people do that.  I know.  Tell me what to do and I'll do it.  You guys come up with it.  How about this?  You give me the other number to call, so I don't have to get back on hold for like two  hours.  I can get in touch with her, we'll figure something out, and I'll be back in touch with you guys  within 45 minutes.  No, just call it.  No, we can't give out that number.  Just call back when you have it figured out.  We'll remember you, I swear.  All right, cool.  All right?  It's got to be good. 
[00:46:00]  It's got to be really good.  All right.  All right, ladies.  Speaking of which, Anthony, we do have a pair of NSYNC tickets.  NSYNC?  Two pairs of tickets to see NSYNC.  Ooh.  With the backdoor boys.  No, it's separate.  Wait, we have what?  Two NSYNC and one Backstreet Boys.  Oh, oh.  Your NSYNC Backstreet Boys connection.  Now listen, I think we're going to start this contest next week.  Yeah.  It's a very simple contest.  It's called Mommy.  Mommy.  Mommy.  Mommy. 
[00:46:30]  Mommy.  What would you do for NSYNC tickets?  It's sort of a Mother's Day tie and awesome.  This is a huge.  Yeah, very good.  And we love this because we've gotten some great, great guests from this.  It's a huge promotion for our show.  I know there's a lot of people that would die for NSYNC tickets.  They're pretty good seats too, right?  Mm-hmm.  And basically we ask the mommies what they would do for the NSYNC tickets.  Yeah.  The winner last time we did this shot a bottle rocket out of her coochie.  Yeah.  Coochie fireworks. 
[00:47:00]  That was great.  Coochie fireworks.  Bottle rocket went flying out down the hall.  Right out of the area.  We had the mother-daughter queefing team.  Queefing team on the phone.  That was wonderful.  And of course, the famous gay Marco, who was never with a woman before, eating some peach  for NSYNC tickets.  So, Mommy, start thinking.  Because we're going to ask you next week, what would you do for the NSYNC tickets?  We're going to have a little competition, all right?  Yeah.  There's something to think about. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Anthony.  Yeah.  We should take a break.  Nick, you want to get into the divorce thing again with the Giuliani's?  Giuliani.  Yeah.  Some interesting things with that today.  Yeah.  And I want to get into, there was an article in the paper today about a school that's  canceling Mother's Day.  Canceling Mother's Day.  All over the news today.  And you're not going to believe why.  How tragic.  We'll get into that next.  You sound like the news people.  Mother's Day canceled, and you're not going to believe why.  We'll tell you about it later in the broadcast. 
[00:48:00]  But first, tragedy strikes.  You know why?  That's funny.  But you know what?  But that wasn't a life-threatening tease.  No.  This is what I hate.  And we've talked about this before.  These news stations, they'll do life-threatening teases.  Life-threatening tease, right?  Something that your kids are playing with right now could kill them.  We'll let you know about it tonight at 11.  Yeah.  Swear to God I heard that tease.  Can the food you're eating give you cancer immediately? 
[00:48:30]  We'll tell you about it a little later in the broadcast.  But first, weather.  Hey, you've got to get us some heat here.  But first, weather with the gay guy.  The life-threatening tease.  The life-threatening, they do it all the time.  Infected water with E. coli in our area.  We'll tell you the areas a little later in the broadcast.  Drink up.  There's a...  God, I need to know her name because I hate her. 
[00:49:00]  She's a...  She's a...  She's a chink newswoman.  Oh, my God.  And she does those teases.  Well, I don't think she's thinking about it.  In the late morning.  In the late morning.  I've seen Cynthia Sandama do it myself.  This just out.  Can your motor vehicle kill you?  Yeah.  Are you driving the SUV that could explode at any moment?  We'll let you know at 5 o'clock tonight.  And now also the big thing is the food. 
[00:49:30]  And the restaurants and supermarkets.  Everything.  We'll show you where not to eat.  A little later in the broadcast.  Fees and food.  We'll tell you where.  Yeah, great.  I'm going out to eat.  I'm going out to lunch right now.  Bitch.  That's something I'd like to know right now.  Where is it?  It's like...  I have reservations.  Tell me where it is.  I got to go out.  I can't wait for the end of the broadcast. 
[00:50:00]  Blurt it out.  Blurt the name out.  They got to hold their listeners.  I'll be.  Other viewers.  Yeah, but enough with the deaf teases is all we're saying.  Killer teases.  Killer teases.  Killer teases in the news.  We'll tell you about it.  We can understand, you know, what male movie star likes to suck sea.  We'll tell you at 11.  That's not going to affect...  You can wait for that.  Yeah, it's not going to affect me personally.  Unless it's you.  But you tell me my...  Right, right.  Then you kind of want to know.  Right, right. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Did they catch me?  Jesus Christ.  Right.  Yes, it is Nancy Lou, Carolyn.  I hate that.  I hate...  Nancy Lou?  That's the one.  Thank you, Carolyn.  You're very welcome.  Or is it Caroline?  Caroline.  It's Caroline, Brian.  Caroline.  Caroline.  It's Caroline?  It's Caroline.  Oh, okay.  I hate your name, by the way.  Because I got a Caroline in my family and a Caroline.  And every time I see them, I don't know which one to say. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, no.  What's the baby do?  The baby do.  And they both get pissed off.  Caroline or Caroline.  Right.  And I have one of each in my family.  Well, maybe they'll try to make it up to you and name both of their children Opie.  Yeah.  I know.  What a great name.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  It's not Katie Tong on the WB?  No.  Katie's all right.  She's been around forever.  Yeah.  Nancy Lou.  God, she drives me nuts.  Katie was New York's answer to Connie Chung.  Yeah.  Right.  Actually, she was the local version of Connie Chung. 
[00:51:30]  And everyone got them confused.  Connie Tong?  Katie Chung?  Who?  I remember that when she first burst on the scene here.  When the Asian chick reporter was very new.  Now it's like every station you turn to.  Every station has it.  It's Sheila Wang.  Oh, my God.  Every station has to have the gay weatherman, the Chinese news girl.  You need the black guy.  The black reporter going through the black neighborhoods.  neighborhoods and the crippled guy in the wheelchair for those special stories. 
[00:52:00]  There's only one of those so far, though.  Hispanic reporter, too, you need.  You can't just cover the urban stories with a black guy anymore.  You're right.  You need the Spanish guy.  You can cover it with who?  Like a Chang Chung Perez.  Oh, good.  Yes.  And I've seen that guy.  It's like, what is he?  Right.  He's multifaceted.  Sure.  Just, you know, you could probably break into the news if you're kind of ethnic looking,  but you're not sure what it is.  And just call yourself Bill Chang Rodriguez Johnson. 
[00:52:30]  You're in.  Hey.  Leroy Wang.  Leroy Wang.  Cover all your angles.  You know, we should take a break, but we're on your game.  What's up with Opie being a tool today?  Am I being a tool today?  Uh, Randy.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Why am I a tool, Randy?  Let's get it over with.  You know what?  I don't know.  I don't think you're a tool generally, but today, I mean, picking on poor Caroline,  Caroline, I hate your name.  Oh, no.  She knows I was kidding.  That's an old Brian Regan bit. 
[00:53:00]  She's cool with that.  Oh.  What's the matter?  You don't listen to Brian Regan?  Okay.  People that listen to the show, you can't have a thin, you know, a thin skin.  We just F around.  And don't take things out of context.  Well, you know.  When you're doing a Brian Regan bit, you should know it.  Study your O&A.  Very good.  See, now he has to be in the A-hole.  See how it changes, Randy?  Yeah, well, you know.  What can you do?  No, I don't know.  Take care, man.  All right.  But really fast, because we were talking about the guy in the wheelchair.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, man, he's a great reporter and stuff.  Yeah.  But a little advice to the guy, he shouldn't just, like, dramatically wheel up.  It's a little weird.  Do the roll shot.  The roll shot.  Well, Opie, a reporter that can walk and talk is very, very valuable to a news station.  And what they do is they go on scene, and then the reporter starts walking, either toward  the camera, maybe side to the camera, and going, I'm here in front of this building,  and they're walking in the zoom out.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  It's got to be dramatic.  You can't just be standing there.  If you're standing there, a guy in a gorilla suit might pounce him with a wild sign. 
[00:54:00]  You think they've got to keep moving.  You think they're sitting there counting the steps because they know where they have to  end up by the end of their little...  Oh, absolutely.  So I'll start here.  Let's run through it a couple of times, and then when we go live, I'll know that I'm  walking.  You zoom out.  It's going to be fantastic.  Right.  So the guy in the wheelchair, he starts talking, and he'll give his wheelchair a push.  And he's talking and rolling.  I'm rolling here in front of this building.  It's too nerve-wracking because I'm like, is he going to slow down in time? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Is he going to, you know, bang into the camera guy?  And then he'll put his hand down and stop himself.  Right.  Like the guy that's walking would stop walking.  I give the guy a lot of credit.  Yeah.  He pulls it off, but as a viewer, it makes me very nervous.  I get a little uptight.  It does.  It gets me like, oh, my God.  Where's he going?  Right.  Is he going to stop?  He's just wheeling.  Where's the hill?  He wheels off camera.  All right.  I'm going to roll down here when we go live.  Yeah.  Let's run through it a couple of times.  Scout, what's up?  Hey, you forgot one guy, man. 
[00:55:00]  Huh?  The fat weather guy.  It's either the gay weather guy, right, or the fat weather guy.  Right.  The fat, jolly weather guy, who is probably gay.  Right.  Anyway.  Not as many father-son weather teams anymore.  No.  That's a dying breed.  We only have one.  Storm Field and Dr. Frank Field.  Yeah.  The fields are still happening.  What were those two nutcases on Channel 9 way back?  Whoa.  The father-son team.  Well, there was that one guy.  Hello.  Yeah, but then his son. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, well, instant feedback, so I'll give us the answer.  The guy that used to go, hello, and a very special hello to you.  His whole bit was hello.  Yeah, he was the hello guy.  And then the name of the town.  Yeah.  Then he named it.  Hello, I can say.  Right?  Yeah, but I can't remember his name.  He had, like, three names, like serial killer.  But he was kind of, like, a little freaky.  I can't believe he had a son. 
[00:56:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I had him pegged as the gay leather man.  Oh, Lloyd Young.  Thank you.  Lloyd Lindsey Young.  Thank you.  You can stop sending in your Lloyd Lindsey Young.  Tracy.  Yeah.  Well, turn on your radio.  You're on the radio.  I'm on the radio.  All right.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, it was Lloyd Young, right?  Yeah, Lloyd Lindsey Young.  Lloyd Lindsey Young.  And then what was his son's name?  Because his son took over after him, I thought.  Then he went to Lloyd Lindsey Young, and Lloyd Lindsey went to Lloyd Lindsey Old.  Yeah, well, whatever.  He was an absolute reject. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, Tracy.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  One thing about the Asian reporters and newswomen, though, they don't age.  Don't age.  No.  Kylie Tong looks as young as she did when she first started in New York.  You know who age is?  The national, the network anchor women that they keep on forever.  Like, what's her name there?  Arnold's wife.  Oh.  Maria Thrive.  Oh, no, the praying mantis.  She looks horrible.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  The praying mantis.  That's awful.  Just a skull with skin.  How are you?  No, but the Asian ones, they don't age.  They got more shelf life.  Maybe that's why they keep them.  Look at poor Michelle Marsh.  Oh, poor Mish.  Woo.  Mish Marsh.  Yeah.  She hit the wall.  She was a hot little thing for a while there.  And then what about that other one, the black chick that can never say five lines without  screwing up?  Oh, wow. 
[00:57:30]  Roz Abrams.  Roz.  Roz Abrams.  Yeah, Roz.  Do you remember the campaign that they had on whatever channel she was on?  Channel 7.  Channel 7.  And it had a little song to it, Step Up and Say Hi to Roz.  Yep.  And they show her on the street, and she's walking, and people are like, Hi, Roz.  Like, that was their campaign.  Hi, Roz.  And she's walking, Hi.  Step right up and say hi to Roz.  Hi to Roz.  And hi, Roz.  How the F did she agree to that?  Can you imagine they approach you, Hey, we're going to do this huge campaign where it amounts 
[00:58:00]  to you walk down the street, people are going to say hi to you.  Not just the normal way that they would every day, but we are going to promo it to force  people to come up to you and annoy you 24 hours a day.  Step up and say hi to Roz.  Right, right, right.  Hi, and Roz will say, Go F yourself.  Imagine she's like, Look, man, the camera's not on.  Yeah.  You know, because it's pretty weird for me.  Yeah, she's got to be in restaurants all over the place.  And all these, like, nice dressed people are going, Hi, Roz. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  Well, hi.  Hi, Roz.  Step right up and say hi.  Hello, Roz.  Hi.  You know.  Thank you.  I saw it on a commercial that said hi, Roz.  You got five dollars?  Sue Simmons, that's right.  Sue Simmons.  Another one that screws up the reading of the copy.  She's the one that really F's it up.  Don, what's up?  That's what I meant.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Fuck it, Roz.  Oh, I mean, hi.  How about that Sue Simmons, man?  She can't talk on the television. 
[00:59:00]  She stumbles, mutters, every single goddamn word she says.  Yeah.  I can't get to her first.  She's the one I was talking about.  All right?  Unbelievable.  Very good.  You know, it's going to piss off Channel 2, but the new black lady they got, deeply disturbing  how much she smiles.  What, really?  Holy ass.  Someone get me her name.  The new black chick on...  I think she does probably 6 and 11.  We're not around at 6, but 11. 
[00:59:30]  CBS News?  Yeah, they got rid of Dana Tyler.  And Stephen Clark.  And Stephen Clark.  That would be Lisa Hill.  Lisa Hill.  She smiles like she's biting into a lemon.  WCBS.com is West Coast Business Systems?  No, no, no.  My God.  I want to see a picture of her.  But what's her name?  Lisa Hill.  Lisa Hill.  She smiles like she's, yeah, chomping on a lemon.  It's like a sourpuss smile thing happening. 
[01:00:00]  Really?  She smiles all the time.  It's the worst smile I've ever seen on TV.  I can't pop her up right now.  Damn it.  We've got to find a picture of her, because you'll die.  I mean, watch tonight.  You'll start laughing.  It's just one of those obscure, stupid things that piss me off.  Ackie smile.  All right.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Good.  Do they have her smiling in the picture?  What's her name?  Lisa Hill.  Yeah, Lisa Hill.  Lisa Hill. 
[01:00:30]  She only told me four times.  I can't remember.  CBS News, Lisa Hill.  Damn it.  Hey, Brian, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  I've got to say, today you're right on the nail with everything that you're saying about  these reporters.  Yeah.  I work at a news station over in Jersey, and, yeah, they run through it five times, and  then they get back and say, oh, did I miss the step?  Did I say something wrong?  Can I do that one again?  Yeah, it's all about walking and talking at the same time.  And they have to stop talking and walking at the same time. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  Oh, yeah, and then the camera has to stop at the same time, and they say, this looks  dramatic now.  We see the building.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what we want.  Yeah.  Cheesy.  Very cheesy.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Thanks.  You don't got it in?  No, I can't.  Because now the sights must be getting pounded or something.  Where do you want to go in?  Eat at your own risk.  Eat at your own risk.  Nightcast.  Weeknights.  11 o'clock.  Their news story.  Eat at your own risk.  They don't tell you what, where, who, how.  There's another killer tease. 
[01:01:30]  Not nice.  Damn it.  All right, there's one more thing I got to mention.  All right.  And I know someone's going to pick up on this.  Russ Salzberg.  It's got to be said.  Oof.  Russ Salzberg does sports with that little pixie with the blonde hair, the cute little  one.  Yeah.  That I don't think ever played a sport in her life.  I think he should have at least played a sport to be a sportscaster.  Just my own little pet peeve.  Right.  I don't care if you're a woman, but at least, you know, you should have been, you should 
[01:02:00]  have played a sport.  Ben might have Lisa Hill's picture.  All these sites are getting pounded now.  Anyway, Russ Salzberg, he, he co-anchors the sports report every night, Anthony.  Yeah.  That's the, oh, it's not Lisa Hill, man.  That's not her.  She's a black chick.  No, she's.  It says it right here in the, uh, in the paper.  No, she's the new one with Ernie and Nastas.  Ernie's still going strong in New York, huh? 
[01:02:30]  It's, uh, Ernie's partner on channel two.  Maury Alter, remember him?  Maury Alter.  Didn't he get trounced?  No, it's not, it's not Lisa.  Aw.  Okay, Jay's on this.  Listen to this, Anthony, because you probably haven't seen Russ.  Uh, Jay, turn on your radio.  You're on.  Yeah, it's now.  All right, what are you going to say?  Angela Pinhead Ray.  That's who it is.  Right, okay.  Who the one on the stick?  But then, getting back to the Russ Salzberg thing, man, they, they, they act like a silent  movie vaudeville type of thing.  They're so off cue. 
[01:03:00]  And she doesn't even know what she's talking about.  Women in sports, not cool.  No, you know, because people are going to jump down my throat.  It's not even that.  First of all, I don't think there should be like, uh, you know, a team sports thing  going on on the news.  No, never.  But those two, and this is, Russ Salzberg is the biggest pussy.  And I'll tell you why.  He has agreed to do his sports reports with a, with a woman.  Uh-huh.  That's, that's bad enough right there, because it's not tough to be, uh, you know, uh, the  sports guy on a, on a, on a, on a news broadcast.  Alone. 
[01:03:30]  It's a, it's a five minute gig.  Yeah.  And now you're splitting the time with someone else.  Warner Wolfe made himself famous with it.  Right, with the, you know, she's the cute blonde one that actually takes  the lead on that.  Russ is kind of like the second guy there to begin with.  Not only that, they make these two go out and do really silly things that Russ agrees  to.  Uh-huh.  Where they'll like, you know, they'll try to.  Giant Pop-Tart kind of stuff.  Yeah, they'll try to, uh, I don't know, they'll, they'll take a dance class together, or they'll,  or they'll play badminton together.  The sports guy.  Yeah, they, they put Russ in these stupid, you know, stupid situations. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Where he looks completely ridiculous.  Uh-huh.  And he has agreed to all this.  Jesus.  Wow, that must suck.  There she is, Angela Ray.  Oh, let me see.  But there's, that smile's pretty normal.  Yeah.  That's a normal smile.  Monica Pellegrini.  Thank you, Dennis.  There's a killer tease playing on our show.  It's about killer vegetables.  I think the promo's called Eat Your Vegetables and Die.  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:30]  We're playing something like that.  A news teaser.  Probably.  A spot.  I can't wait until it comes on.  I'm going to have to listen now.  I don't know.  Who listens to the commercial?  Eat Your Vegetables and Die.  Dennis, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, Monica Pellegrini, dude.  Explain to Anthony how, you know, they'll do these little clips where they go out and  try.  The dumbest things I've ever seen in sports ever.  Try stupid things.  Holy crap, dude. 
[01:05:00]  Any freaking whore can just read some, read out some cue cards and sound like she knows  about what she's talking about.  Dennis, you're not getting it.  I'm not, I'm not trashing the fact that Monica Pellegrini is, you know, like a sports  lady on the news.  That's fine.  I think Russ is a pussy.  No, but the stupid skits, like when they try to team him up for like, to cover something.  Yeah, they team him.  They're totally off.  They team him up and then, you know, he's trying like things that he shouldn't be trying.  The worst thing I ever saw, they tried to team him up for this golf outing thing.  Right.  And I guess that's Russ's covetee or whatever, but oh my God, the worst thing. 
[01:05:30]  She's sitting there trying to golf or something.  It's just stupid.  Well, you know who's responsible for that?  A show that came out a few years back, Good Day New York.  The Morning News Show.  And they had a bunch of people just doing insane things under the guise of like a news  show.  And I think one of them was that English guy that would bang on the doors and, hello.  Oh, he called you.  Yeah.  Gordon Elliott.  Gordon Elliott here. 
[01:06:00]  Gordon.  And he'd bang on the doors and cook people dinner and stuff.  And then they had another wacky guy that for some reason on a new morning news show,  he's going to jump out of an airplane with a parachute.  Yeah.  So then all these other, and it did very well.  Right.  So all these other news stations, the networks, start thinking, hey, we need a wacky stunt  guy.  Right.  On our news show.  So they start sending out the news people to do, like you said, dance things.  Well, but yeah, with Russ Salzberg, though, he's getting involved with Monica Pellegrini  in these really ridiculous things. 
[01:06:30]  I don't have specific examples which are pissing me off right now.  I can't think.  I used to love the news when it was, you got the anchorman, very serious, no cohorting  with the fellow people on the set.  They tell you how many people died in the NAM and then golf to sports.  Right.  You know, it's just serious stuff.  Now it's all banter at the end of the news broadcast.  Right.  You know, okay, we'll see you again at 11.  Ha ha, it's fine.  I'm like, what?  And she's like, oh, Jake. 
[01:07:00]  You know, a little banter.  Cowbell Bill.  Hey, what do you say, guys?  How do you?  Hey, you talk about annoying.  Has anybody seen this black sports guy on CBS?  Tiki?  Tiki Barber?  Is that his name?  Oh, Tiki Barber.  I just had him on the show last week.  Right.  The guy can't talk.  You know, it sounds like a course between Buckwheat and Elmer Fudd.  And the Yankees won yesterday.  Oh, wow. 
[01:07:30]  He just talked about that.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  Well, I just wanted to put my two cents on.  Oh, yeah.  That was one and two.  I got to turn it off.  Very nice.  Thank you.  All right, Bill.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  If I see a phone call come up and it says Tiki, I'm leaving the studio.  Could very well happen.  Tonight on CBS 2.  On JAG.  In the military, you're supposed to hide your face.  Yeah, there's the killer T somewhere. 
[01:08:00]  But Harm and Mac are about to break the rules for real.  And then after an all-new edition of 60 Minutes 2, it's hard to find love later in life.  Is there something you want to tell me?  I am feeling for you.  And even harder to lose it.  Judging any all-new episodes.  Tonight, starting at 8 on CBS 2.  Followed by Netcast at 11.  Tonight on CBS 2.  I was, like, totally sick.  Meet a little girl who almost died from eating her vegetables.  Of course, I just ravaged that tiny little body. 
[01:08:30]  How can something as simple as lettuce put your life at risk?  I'm Ernie Anastas.  I'm Angela Ray.  Tonight, CBS 2's month-long food investigation continues.  Find out what you need to know about the safe handling of fruits and vegetables.  Eat at your own risk.  Tonight at 11 on CBS.  You bastards.  What's wrong with the lettuce?  What is it?  Can I have a salad?  Holy crap.  A lot of people eat in front of the TV.  You're getting that tease as you're eating lettuce.  What's wrong with my lettuce?  Great miserable crap.  Yeah, right, Homer. 
[01:09:00]  Tell me what's wrong with the lettuce.  Save some lives.  The killer teases.  Great example.  Eat at your own risk.  Okay, I won't.  Right.  Jesus.  I'll just starve.  I'll just starve until you tell me what's going on at 11.  Thanks.  Thanks, Dick.  Their month-long food investigation for a month.  Well, you know what?  The cow thing was so effective, they decided we've got to keep this going.  Oh, yeah.  Dragging the sick cows to slaughter. 
[01:09:30]  Probably the sickest thing I've ever seen on TV.  That was a cow that was dying.  A goddamn cow dying.  They call them downers or down.  I don't know.  But it was still alive.  There's a term, barely.  So legally, you can slaughter it.  Barely.  So they're dragging this in.  As the cow, it was all matted and had bugs and foaming at the mouth.  It can't even get on its legs to walk to slaughter.  So they're dragging it to the bolt in the head. 
[01:10:00]  Foam.  Meh.  Dragging it to slaughter.  The cow goes, meh.  No, this cow wasn't.  Meh.  They shoved that down our throat right after the Survivor finale.  Yeah.  You're in a feel-good type of mood, and all of a sudden they're showing, you know, really sick cows being dragged to slaughter.  And I love a good steak, you know?  Oh.  And you know how I like it, right?  Uh, medium rare? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Which way?  You know, but now, they got me so scared, you want to take a blowtorch to it before you eat it.  Peace, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  What about those two tools they sent to Giants, Dave, to the football?  Later, Megan.  You got it, Pete.  You got to give them that.  Come on, the diving for the football thing was cool.  That was pretty wacky.  Hey, we could go for ourselves, too, with the help.  Killer green peas. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  Coming soon.  Green peas.  Why?  Mm-hmm.  But I did it right.  Carrots.  What's up, Doc?  You'll be seeing your doctor after eating these carrots.  Purchase that.  Oh, no, we'll tell you later.  We'll tell you at 11.  Because we are deeks.  Your chick has chlamydia.  We'll tell who you are after these messages. 
[01:11:30]  There's a murderer in your house right now.  What's your address?  Find out at 11.  How?  So true, so true.  We got to take a break.  We're late.  Your husband just went into the restaurant to get his gun, and you're sitting out in the car.  Who's going to shoot you?  We'll tell you at 11.  That chick was a whore, man.  Oh, and what a looker, though. 
[01:12:00]  What a looker.  Yeah, you see the picture of the paper?  I'm thinking it was a stray shot.  Her head is so big, the odds of some stray bullet hitting it.  Kind of a good deal there.  You look like the big-headed creature from South Park.  The chango-chango-mouth.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.  Oh, whatever.  Wow.  Okay, we got to take a break.  Chewy, chewy, chomp. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, whatever, right.  We got to take a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Pink lettuce.  Watch out for our pink lettuce.

[01:13:30]  Fat Lip.  The O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I'm liking how the music brings us back into the show.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of like that.  Yes.  Something a little different from your radio show.  Popular little ditties.  All right, there's so much going on today.  Yeah.  You know, really quick, I mean, we don't have much on it, but how about the guy that falls 
[01:14:00]  off the Williamsburg Bridge and doesn't even hurt himself?  Well, I think he's hurt, but he didn't break any bones.  Didn't break a bone.  He didn't stop breathing.  Stopped breathing.  They had to kickstart his lungs a little bit there.  Get him breathing again.  Yeah, he'd landed, how far down was it?  150 feet, I believe.  150 feet into the East River.  This guy's working on the Williamsburg Bridge.  Falls off.  He lands next to a barge.  They kind of scoop him out of the water. 
[01:14:30]  Paramedics right there.  Get him breathing again.  And as he's getting into the hospital, he starts talking.  Yeah.  150 feet.  At a height like that, the water has the consistency of cement.  Right.  And he's a lucky man, they say.  Told his wife that his family flashed before him as he was coming down.  And he said, it seems like it took forever before he hit the water.  Oh, man. 
[01:15:00]  What the hell is that like?  Falling.  Boy, that sucked.  That was a little slippery.  Oh, yeah.  That's exactly what he was thinking.  Kind of looking down.  Yeah.  Water's coming up now.  I think it was more like.  Do you think he did?  Holy cow.  Are you just kind of like, oh, my God, freaking out on the way down?  And what's your first thought when you start breathing again?  Holy ass, I survived that. 
[01:15:30]  But he stopped breathing.  So, you know.  That's what I mean after they, you know, got his life going again.  You're like, open your eyes and go, wait a minute.  Get out of here.  No way I pulled through this.  You mean I get to survive?  Oh.  God bless the guy.  I guess so.  Someone do the math for us.  How long does it take to fall 150 feet?  How fast was he going?  Did he reach terminal velocity?  Yeah, because you're going pretty damn fast by the time you hit that water. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Dennis.  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  It's me again.  Hey.  I'm just a freaking encyclopedia full of useless information.  That's all right.  Guinness Book of World Records' highest high jump was 172 feet.  And the guy landed wrong.  And he hit it like, almost like he'd be on like all fours, like his shins and his palms.  Wow.  And he was okay.  He was okay?  Yeah, the guy was totally fine.  How the hell was that?  But that's still pretty rough, dude. 
[01:16:30]  150 feet.  Imagine this guy set the record and he wasn't even trying for it.  He just missed.  You know.  He just missed the record.  Did he do it again?  122 feet.  Oh.  All right, fellas.  I'm out of here.  All right, cool.  Peace.  Yeah, what a...  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, that's...  Wow.  That is just a little too high to be falling.  You go to the high diving board at a public pool.  How high is that?  The real high ones.  Maybe 20.  20 feet. 
[01:17:00]  Maybe.  And you know you look over the edge and go, I can't do this.  Yeah, you get all freaked out and stuff.  I've never gone...  Have you ever gone off to the high diving board and one of those at a pool?  Oh, yeah.  You have?  Oh, yeah.  I could never do it.  I'm the pussy that walks back down the ladder.  I'm the pussy.  You never jumped into like a quarry or anything?  No.  You did that.  No.  I was going to say, because you always hear about that.  People go to the quarry and jump in and they end up dead.  Never jumped off a bridge or something?  No. 
[01:17:30]  Why would I want to do that?  I like the regular standard diving board on the 8 to 10 foot swimming pool.  You know what I mean.  Yeah.  The regular one.  Not the high diving board.  It's certainly not 150 feet.  You guys got a story to tell.  No broken bones.  You got to go through life thinking, oh, I was dead.  They bring me back.  Why?  How?  Who?  That's like a life-changing event.  That's all good. 
[01:18:00]  You're like, all right.  You know, I'm going to look at things differently now.  Like, what's his face on Survivor that fell into the fire?  Oh, Michael?  He kicked out a little too far, didn't he?  Yeah.  It's like, show us your hands.  And they show him there's nothing wrong with him anymore.  You know, this made me appreciate my family, my life, everybody else.  Like, dude.  I can name 15 of my friends that have done that in the woods growing up in high school that  fell into the fire. 
[01:18:30]  The wood-ins?  The wood-ins, is it?  Nah.  It'd be 120 miles an hour.  Oh.  120 miles an hour.  You're saying the guy hit the water going 120 miles an hour?  Um, it's 150 feet.  Yeah, it's good.  I don't like when we discuss physics on this show because our audience never gets it right.  I'm just really curious.  I want to know how fast he was going when he hit the water.  I know there's a formula to it.  It increases over time but only to a certain point.  And it's like it doubles every whatever. 
[01:19:00]  But I'm not sure what it is.  This guy says your weight doubles every foot you fall.  That's why I love discussing this because we all have a different way of figuring it out.  But no, this is a constant.  There's no opinions on this.  That's what makes it fun, though.  On this problem.  It's an absolute.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, you guys remember Action Park?  Yeah.  Remember all the people that used to die there? 
[01:19:30]  I used to love Action Park.  You'd go to those little Indy cars and they had the Alpine Slide,  which we call the Alpine Hamburger.  You'd fall off and you're in a cement half pipe just rolling down as your knees are leaving  skin all over the tube.  I have half of my wagon left in one of those freaking tubes.  Yeah.  Let's see how many theories we can get on the air.  Joe.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's the formula, Joe?  It's 13 feet per second per second.  It goes up exponentially every second. 
[01:20:00]  13 feet the first second.  And then 26 more feet the second second.  Until what?  Until you hit the ground.  No, because there is terminal velocity.  There is a point where you just stop gaining speed.  So it can't double.  That's not the right...  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  I learned it in science class.  Like, you didn't breathe.  Look, we finally need the knowledge from science class and we can't figure it out. 
[01:20:30]  Come on.  No, I'm serious.  All objects, no matter what the weight, all fall at the same rate of speed.  Well, that we know.  13 feet per second per second.  It may get to a point where it stops.  That's what Ant's saying.  That may be right.  I don't know what that is, though, but that's the rate of the shift.  Cosmic is saying a constant is 32 feet per second.  That's as fast as any object can fall.  Milo Yambags has the formula written.  X plus stinky equals 420 times equals weed. 
[01:21:00]  Now I need to know.  Howie.  Yo.  What's up?  What's going on?  All right.  Yo, you guys know how many meters that was?  What?  Don't bring meters into it.  All you've got to do is transfer it to meters and then multiply it by 9.8.  I swear to God.  This is so easy.  We were all stupid in school.  All right.  We've got supposedly a physics professor.  Sure.  Oh, okay. 
[01:21:30]  Sure.  I'll buy this.  Adam.  Yo.  You're not a physics professor.  Yo.  I'm visiting my girlfriend.  I do physics.  All right.  What do you got?  The correct formula is 32 feet per second per second.  You reach your terminal velocity after you have eight cycles.  Okay.  No, I don't know.  I don't know how far it was.  I just switched the channels.  I don't know how far it was falling, but you guys got a calculator.  You do the math.  Wait, and you fell 150 feet?  150 feet?  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  32 feet per second.  Per second.  Per second.  Per second.  You reach your terminal velocity once that cycles eight times, and you don't go any faster.  32 feet per second.  And then after eight cycles, so eight times 32?  No, because it doubles.  Right.  No way.  You'd be falling so fast.  Yeah, but once you hit so many feet, once you reach the eight cycles, it stops, and you 
[01:22:30]  just maintain that speed.  Oh, I need to know now.  I need to know.  I don't have my calculator on me, and I'm driving, so I'm sorry, guys.  So he only fell for about four seconds?  Probably.  That's a long four seconds, though.  That's why those skydivers, you know, they...  No, not even four.  Like, three seconds, according to your math.  Yeah, really fast.  You fall fast.  All right.  I'm getting, like, 8,192 feet per second, which is impossible. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  Dro is a physics major.  He can help.  Yeah, of course.  Dro.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  How's it going?  All right.  All right, listen.  What you got to do...  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Chris from Long Island.  Which falls faster?  I got...  Ah.  Ah, Ben just refreshed just as I was reading it.  Ah.  Ah, here it is.  Chris from Long Island.  Which falls faster?  A guy off a bridge or dice his career or resurrection?  Ah.  What's the formula?  Which way?  All right, Dro, go. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  What you got to do is it does matter what his weight is.  No, it doesn't.  The rate of descent, the cylindrical force, the cylindrical force magnitude, the two objects  that are way the same will only land at the same time near the nearest point.  What you have to do is you have to take his weight.  Shut up.  You have to take his weight.  Listen, I listen to science spas, all right?  I know what to do.  Exactly.  If this doesn't prove that we don't need science in school, I don't know what else does.  The weight.  The weight doesn't matter. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, God.  This is terrible.  I have a master's in physics, says Mike on line four.  All right.  This has to be the end all on this.  He could tell us everything.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  Good.  What people are forgetting, they have to take the coefficient of friction, and when  the coefficient of friction meets the acceleration, that's your terminal velocity.  All these guys are explaining it like they're in Bellevue. 
[01:24:30]  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  Give us the formula.  I don't know the formula off the top of my head, but when...  All right.  If you have a master's in physics, you can...  All right.  I was wondering if I had a master's in physics.  Ah.  That's what it was.  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  Take it easy.  He don't have it.  All right.  He doesn't have it.  No one has this.  God damn.  Did anyone go to school?  Anyone remember this? 
[01:25:00]  Kelly, do you know?  Kelly, do you know?  No.  No?  You didn't...  But you're cute, so that's okay.  Ah, Cecil.  Cecil.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Listen, I went skydiving like three, four times, and what they told us is that you fall  at about between 125 and 140 miles an hour, and it depends upon the wind.  The variance is the wind.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  I can see...  That's the speed.  I mean, I don't have a formula, but that's the speed.  All we want to know is if he reached that by the time he hit the water.  So we have to know what it is up to 150 feet.  Well, they told us that, like...  Well, pretty much, like, the second you step out of the plane, you're going pretty much that  fast.  I mean, I don't know how else to explain it.  Because the plane's going over that speed.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, this guy has his physics book open. 
[01:26:00]  Uh, Jason.  Hi, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  You guys want to find out the final velocity?  No.  We want to know...  Simple question.  The guy fell 150 feet.  I want to know how long he was falling.  All right.  Well, I got some...  And maybe how fast he was going when he hit the water.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I got your...  If you want, you want to write this down, Ed?  Oh, man.  What?  I got to write?  I got to...  Go ahead, Rick.  Write it down.  I'm writing.  The final velocity squared equals the initial velocity squared.  All right. 
[01:26:30]  No, no, no.  All right, look.  You just took me back to 11th grade, and I'm, like, starting to freak out.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Really?  All right.  We're the old school O&A.  Jesus Christ.  Jason.  Yeah.  Velocity squared...  And then what?  Well, you figure...  All right.  You figure his initial velocity is zero.  Okay.  His acceleration, that's 9.8 meters per second squared, or if you want to use your feet,  which is 32. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  32 feet.  Okay.  All right.  And then...  Oh, God.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  Oh, I got...  All right.  Well, I got the point for you guys, and I understand it's a little scientific.  Can we get Wile E. Coyote on the phone, please?  I'm on the Ask a Scientist index page on the web.  Now, where did he get the 32 feet per second, is the question?  Gravity.  That's gravity?  Okay.  That's gravity.  So, he's falling at 32 feet per second. 
[01:27:30]  It's roughly between four and five seconds.  Bill is saying three and a half seconds.  Bill.  Yeah.  Hey.  Okay.  Here's the formula.  Okay.  If you want to do the math on it, T squared plus 32 T, and then you have your distance.  Now, the T is the amount of time.  Okay.  You do a little calculus, and you take the derivative of it.  It gives you the acceleration.  Of course.  Goddamn derivative crap.  I hate it.  There you go.  He hit the water at 98 feet per second.  Now, you guys can figure out the miles per hour. 
[01:28:00]  But, he hit the water at 98 feet per second.  Right.  And, he fell for about three and a half seconds.  Right.  Because, you take the average speed, which is about 43 miles an hour, or 43 feet per second.  43 feet.  Without doing the whole bit of calculation.  It's about three and a half seconds.  But, I thought you couldn't fall quick, and then...  Now, what these guys are talking about, everything falls at the same rate, but in a perfect vacuum.  Yeah, I got the right.  So, one guy talks about coefficient of friction.  He's right.  Yeah, but that's inconsequential here.  Here, it's inconsequential. 
[01:28:30]  You're absolutely right.  You don't reach terminal velocity by the time you hit the water, and the coefficient of friction on a guy in the air is not enough to worry about.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  My brain has exploded.  Yeah.  So, basically, he's just falling through the air, and it's not as far as the skydiving guys.  Yeah, their math is probably right.  I don't do skydiving.  But, you're not falling 5,000 feet.  You're not building up enough velocity to reach terminal.  But, 98 feet per second, that hurts when you hit.  So, do we have how fast he was going when he hit the water and how long he was falling for yet? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  So, how long he was falling was 3 1⁄2 seconds.  Okay.  And, how fast he was going was 98 feet per second, like at miles per hour.  Yeah.  So, take, I didn't do all the long math, but take 98 feet per second, and you can figure out how many miles per hour that is.  I think you've got something to talk about for the rest of my ride down the turnpike.  Thanks, Bill.  You bet.  I'll leave you with that one to keep you.  That's an easy one.  You guys can get that one.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  All right. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Let's go to Don.  Don, what's up?  Don.  Hello.  Vinny's going to speak for everyone.  Vinny?  All right.  I hate this bit.  Nobody knows the answer.  I've been confused for 30 minutes.  I hate this bit.  Nobody knows the answer.  I've been confused for 30 minutes.  I hate this bit.  Nobody knows the answer.  I've been confused for 30 minutes.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, there you have it. 
[01:30:00]  Adam Ferrara, how are you, sir?  All right.  Well, we're not going to get the answer.  We were all really fast, and it hurt.  All right.  That's amazing that we, our audience, I'm kind of leaning toward that last guy.  But, you know, you can't figure out the speed without doing some math.  Three and a half seconds.  Three and a half seconds.  Give or take a tiny bit there, and 98 feet per second, you hit the water.  98 feet per second. 
[01:30:30]  Do some math.  Figure out how many miles per that is.  Use a calculator, for God's sake.  Heather.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  Great.  My sister lives out in Vegas, and we go cliff diving every time we're out there.  And I used to dive when I was younger, so we go head first.  When you hit the water at, like, 50, 60-foot cliff, if you're holding, last time we went, 
[01:31:00]  we're holding our hands together, lock your hands like you're going head first.  You hit so hard that your hands punch you in the head.  I mean, you...  I feel like that right now.  The minute you hit the water, your hands come up and punch you in the face, and you come out of the water like days.  Nice.  It's rough.  All right, Heather, thank you.  Yeah, bye.  All right, bye.  I think Stinky has the answer.  Stinky's got the answer?  Stinky.  I think I got 66 miles per hour. 
[01:31:30]  That's what 98 feet per second is.  98 feet per second is 66 miles an hour?  That's what I calculated.  I would swear he'd have to be going faster than that, but, Stephen?  Yes, good afternoon.  Hey.  Listen, guys, you're all killing me.  Okay.  Okay.  Things fall at 32 foot per second in a vacuum.  We don't live in a vacuum.  Right.  Big fat construction workers fall a little slower.  Okay.  25 foot per second per second.  First second, they do 25 feet. 
[01:32:00]  Second second.  They do an additional 50.  Third second, 75.  Add it up, it's 150 feet.  He hits the water in three seconds at about 54 miles an hour.  All right.  I like this guy's answer.  I like this guy's answer, but where does it end?  Technically, you'd have to know the body mass of the person, their surface area.  It's way too complicated.  No, I'm not talking about anything.  I'm talking, like, in a vacuum.  In a vacuum?  Technically, it doesn't until it either disintegrates because of nuclear forces on it or, but in a vacuum, it goes on forever. 
[01:32:30]  No, it doesn't.  It has to.  No.  Gravity has its limits as far as pulling the guy down towards Earth.  No, because you're talking a mathematical solution to the question.  Yes, sooner or later, you're going to end up hitting the ground.  Physics doesn't work that way.  They don't care that there's ground.  There's no ground there.  It's 32 foot per second.  No, I can't buy that.  All right, thanks.  I can't buy that.  It keeps going and going and going. 
[01:33:00]  More stupid science stuff.  It is now time for the K-Dog Week in Review.  Help!  I'm...  Science.  Just tell me what you've learned about Earth.  Follow this logic.  Scientists plan to zap tornadoes with microwaves.  All right, well, here we go.  Like, if you heat it, if you heat the water, it'll disappear, and it'll evaporate to gas your storms.  It's like a crack. 
[01:33:30]  That is to dry out a tornado.  Should I set my microwave on popcorn, potato, or frozen dinner?  No!  The hot air drives the cold air.  Now, if you send these high-end microwave beams to it, you turn that cold air into warm air,  and you're not going to get the tornado effect.  Don't be stupid.  I think that the microwave ovens could be used because it's all part.  What?  How do you fight the tornado with your own microwave oven at home?  You've got to look at the bigger picture.  Mental illness.  Treat it before it kills you.  Science.  You made it!  See, if you're emitting small microwave waves from one small microwave, 
[01:34:00]  and if everybody around the tornado area that's going to hit does this,  it's extending emission of microwaves.  Because you can get radiation if you're standing too close to the microwave  or you're cooking something or heating up something.  Well, that's the true effect for you.  That means there's something emitting from these microwave things.  So if you emit it towards the clouds, something could happen,  and you're doing your part to help. 
[01:34:30]  What?  It's a giant horse's ass.  How would you actually focus all of these microwaves?  You would have one center rod that would collect all the emissions in the shooter.  I'm just picturing a bunch of people in their trailers, you know.  Beep, beep, beep.  Come on, Ma, quick.  Get the microwave.  Thank you for the education.

I swear, my head is spinning from that last segment.  You do a little physics on your radio show,  and it, you know, freaks everyone out.  Boobies and physics. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  What the hell is this show?  At what rate do breasts sag?  Yeah.  We should say hi to Adam Ferrara in the studio.  Didn't even know we were stopping by today, but that's okay.  We love when you come by.  Of course, from the job.  Yes.  Now, you know something?  What?  This wacky life thing.  Mm-hmm.  First, it's just like, hey, my pal Adam.  Right.  Yeah, he's playing ha-has somewhere.  Governors.  The charcoal huts.  And now it's like Adam Ferrara.  Governors Thursday through Sunday of this week. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, look at you.  Thursday through Sunday.  Mm-hmm.  Big four-day stand.  The good one?  I think so.  I'm kidding.  The good governors are Area 51.  Yeah, there's UFOs flying out there.  They actually say on the directions, make a ride at the crop circles and listen for the  laughter.  Talking about the governors in Medford, which is a wacky place to have a comedy club.  A little drive to get out there.  Kind of far.  I hear it's a real nice room, though.  Yeah, it is.  It's a nice room, but it's out there. 
[01:38:00]  I mean, pack a lunch.  Yeah, it's going to take a while.  Now it's Adam Ferrara from the hit show, The Job.  Yeah.  You missed the one.  Well, there was a time there was Adam Ferrara from the Olive Garden commercial.  There you go.  Well, the hospitaliano went right out the window, huh?  See?  Look how the life changed, right?  If Adam Ferrara walks into Opie and Anthony's studio, how long for it be before they break  his balls?  Your terminal insult happens at...  Hospitaliano.  But you were the best hospitaliano guy. 
[01:38:30]  Thank you.  You are...  I can't even watch the commercials anymore, because the hospitaliano people are awful.  They don't say it with real conviction.  Right.  You were like, hospitaliano there, pal.  As an actor, you have to commit to the stupidity of it.  Right.  Now they got other people.  I don't know what it is.  I don't like when they change actors.  My grandfather's from Italy.  He came to the U.S., so I took him to the Olive Garden.  Right.  Holy crap.  Now he's going to have me whacked.  My grandfather had polio. 
[01:39:00]  They immigrated to Ellis Island.  They changed his name and gave him a shot.  So I bought him some macaroni.  But now you're on the job, though.  Yes.  And you find out...  We're waiting.  We're in limbo right now.  In limbo.  Waiting to hear from the network.  It's like being on death row.  Did the governor call?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you find out soon.  May 15th.  And I've got to say, I'm knocking wood for you, and it looks good.  You find out if they pick you up for next season.  Find out if we have a life.  The show's got great buzz. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Good ratings.  Very good ratings.  And it's funny.  Yeah.  Not one of those shows that's like, it was critically accepted, yet the public couldn't find it.  I mean, this one the critics liked and the people liked it.  So, best of luck to you, pal.  Thank you, champ.  Jim Norton, I was just about to introduce you to you.  Yeah, where's Norton?  Norton just ran out of here.  He figured out the answer.  He's going to do the math.  So when's Adam going to blow us off here?  I'm not going to blow you off.  The show gets picked up, and I can see it.  Hey, pal, who? 
[01:40:00]  Mr. Farrar, there's a message.  Hospitaliano?  Oh, okay.  I'm not here.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, Adam, this is for you, buddy.  Go ahead.  Was that your real family on the commercial, or were those like actors?  Oh, yeah.  Like Big Joe would sit there and put up with that.  It would be a different commercial if Adam's real father was there.  Well, that wasn't your grandma.  His bread is crap.  With your breadsticks.  It's Hospitaliano.  I thought it would be like, you sound so stupid.  What are you doing talking like that? 
[01:40:30]  And why are you talking to the TV?  We're eating here.  Here he comes.  Hey, Norton.  Jim Norton.  Yeah, I just wanted to get coffee.  Oh, yeah.  You need that.  Yeah, because you're not wound up enough.  Jim, we've got a great idea for you.  What?  We want to hash this out on the air.  Yeah.  We've come up with a really good idea.  All right.  For our next teen concept.  We're going to take a concept very original to radio. 
[01:41:00]  Hasn't been driven into the ground.  Okay.  Taking a game show that's on TV and putting it here on our airwaves.  Really?  What?  What?  But with a different twist?  Yeah.  We want to do Teen Weakest Link with your host, Jim Norton.  Teen Weakest Link.  Now, you ever see the show, The Weakest Link?  No.  The obnoxious...  And she berates you if you're wrong or something, right?  Yeah, she's really a bitch.  I mean, if you're voted on...  Yeah.  You're voted out. 
[01:41:30]  British whore.  Yeah.  And chill out.  You're really turning on Norton.  You mean you're humiliated?  Cool.  Nice.  If you're voted off because you're The Weakest Link, you've got the worst response to the  questions, whatever, she berates you, tells you why you suck and how stupid you are,  and then says you're The Weakest Link.  Goodbye.  So, is this version where you put me in a room with a bunch of teenage girls in which  everyone cries first, that's The Weakest Link?  Yeah, that's The Weakest Link.  That's The Weakest Link, and they have to leave.  The one that bleeds the most.  But we're thinking, we get a bunch of teens, teen girls in here, and we run through a similar 
[01:42:00]  version of the game, only you're the host, because I think you would do a great job  berating teenage girls.  Nice.  Yeah.  I really think you could.  Do you?  Except, yeah, I'm glad you could hear me and teenagers.  Now.  We worked out so well last time.  That's right.  Yeah, well, it'll be here in the studio, so we can keep the cops at bay for a while anyway.  Yeah, absolutely.  We're working on that concept, and we just want to know if you're going to be the host 
[01:42:30]  for that.  Yes.  All right.  And the girls will probably have to dress in some sexy lingerie.  Yes, they will.  What would you be wearing?  Sexy lingerie, I hope.  Or plastic to keep blood off the clothing.  A rain slicker.  Yeah, exactly.  And a sickle.  A clown costume.  Very bad things, they're cleaning up the blood.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  That's the type of thing.  Nice.  Nice.  He's getting way too excited about this.  Yvonne, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  First time caller, long time listener. 
[01:43:00]  Quack, quack.  I'm sorry?  Quack, quack.  I just wanted to tell you about that dying from your lettuce thing you were talking about.  Oh, yeah.  It's actually an old story.  It's this little girl got E. coli from the lettuce on the farm.  Okay.  From like, they dropped the lettuce on the ground where like the animal feces were.  And you don't wash her.  Damn those animal feces.  So that's what they're going to say on the news tonight?  Yeah, they don't wash the lettuce properly.  So the little girl got really sick and she almost died.  Sucks to be her, man. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  And the suspense.  So you don't have to wait until 11.  All right.  Jeez.  All right.  Thanks.  You got it, guys.  Any calls on anything else we said at 3.05 today?  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah.  I have a game for you guys to play.  You're 13 years old, right?  Yeah.  What are you wearing?  A shirt.  A shirt.  A shirt.  A shirt.  A shirt.  A shirt.  A shirt.  A shirt.  A shirt.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  Why Rudy's wife won't let his new girlfriend into the mansion?  You want to play that game? 
[01:44:00]  That's the game you want to play?  Yeah.  I think because she's a scorned bitch right about now.  And she doesn't want Donna Hanover, of course, Rudy's wife.  It's in the paper today.  Right.  Went to court to try to bar Rudy's girlfriend from living and being in Gracie Mansion.  Okay.  Because she's Giuliani's wife.  And people are all so surprised.  I think she's a bitch and she just, you know, who cares?  All right.  Get a divorce.  Get over it.  Whatever.  But, you know, what's the big surprise here that she's doing this? 
[01:44:30]  What do you think?  She'd be fine with the girlfriend living in the house?  Of course not.  No.  She's going to try to get it out.  But she's going to draw the line someplace.  But Rudy, who comes off or tries to come off like this moral leader of New York, shutting  down the clubs.  Script clubs, by the way.  Right.  I don't mean that.  But this guy, moral leader.  Do you see him with his kids anymore?  No.  Have you seen a picture in public with him and that fat son of his that Farley did so 
[01:45:00]  well on SNL?  You never see him.  Same time with the mom.  And the mom is bashing the father.  The mom.  It happens every time.  I was going to say, the mom got the best of him.  I used to hear, you know, when I was growing up and my parents got divorced, I would hear  from my mother about what a scumbag my father was.  And this just happens all the time.  It's human nature.  But a prick, you know, didn't support the family, just ran off.  All right, fine.  You know, I never really held anything to it because I like making my own mind up.  I go out to California to live with my father. 
[01:45:30]  I had a party.  It was a party 24 hours a day.  But then I could see how my mother would be annoyed at me.  You know, it's something that, you know, you could put it in your kid's head that the  father's a real prick.  Right.  But as a kid, the stuff that made him a prick to your mom, you love.  I'm drinking beer and riding bulls at 13.  And your dad got you laid.  Right.  Your mom didn't do that for you.  Hell no.  He tried a couple of times.  I'm kidding. 
[01:46:00]  Stop it.  Dark humor, it's called.  Look into it.  And, yeah, so, you know, I'm sure Donna Hanover's telling the kids, oh, I saw your dad's in  Gracie Manchin with that hoo-ah.  She was a hoo-ah.  She was a hoo-ah.  And the kids are probably like, kind of upset about it.  Donna Hanover is a C-blocker.  Right.  She's better concentrate on her old career, doing the baloney flat monologues, and leave  Rudy alone. 
[01:46:30]  He's the mayor.  If he wants to dump, I have no problem with it.  The baloney flat monologues.  The greasy meat flat monologues.  Oh, is that disgusting?  But, I mean, of course she's going to run around the house.  Does Donna Hanover still live there?  She still lives there.  She still lives there, and Rudy brings his, uh...  And she's got to listen through the wall.  Suck it.  Suck it.  Suck it like Donna never did, you. 
[01:47:00]  And then, you know, he gets done, and he comes out for the obligatory ice water from the  fridge.  And meets Donna Hanover there.  How you doing, honey?  Your ass is getting fat.  Heard from the kids.  I just had the best BJ I ever had, Donna.  How you doing?  How's the baloney life?  Baloney flat monologues.  Hey, uh, Kevin.  The 13-year-old that started it. 
[01:47:30]  Yes.  Hey.  Uh, what do you think about it?  I don't even know what is happening.  I just heard it.  Really?  Yeah.  Your parents get along there, uh, Kevin?  Yeah.  Nice.  Uh, Daddy's not banging anyone else on your side?  Well, no, I'm, I'm, I'm, you know, so the kid can relate.  That's what's going on here.  Rudy's kind of banging someone else there.  Does Daddy ever give your money, go, if Mommy asks, I've been here since 8 o'clock?  Buy in the alibi, right?  No.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  No, you guys suck.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Bye.  What did he say?  You guys suck.  Oh.  He said, how's your dresser?  Dylan.  What is that?  Dylan.  Dylan.  Yeah, I got...  How are you?  I got something that'll top all of this, okay?  Yeah.  Okay, one.  Well, there's two of them.  Which one do you want to hear first, the abortion story or the second kid story?  Uh, whatever, go.  All right, well, um, my grandma, this happened when I was three.  She revealed to my mom that my dad cheated on her twice with the same woman and had two  kids.  So while my mom was living in Brooklyn, she was living in Queens and he was going back and 
[01:48:30]  forth between families.  And your mom had no clue?  No.  He cheated twice and had two kids?  What aim?  Thanks a lot, Warren.  That's amazing.  And the second one, I was nine.  I was having a big fight with my dad, this and this.  And then my aunt came in and said, you should thank your dad.  If it wasn't for him, you wouldn't even be alive because your mom wanted to have an  abortion, but he just wouldn't give her the money.  Wow.  You're loved.  So you got that going for you.  Which is nice.  How many issues do you have?  How long have you been murdering hookers? 
[01:49:00]  There's 55-gallon drums lined up somewhere.  There's a hooker's parts in them.  That's that.  Yeah, wow, that's a little bag.  How old are you now, Dylan?  16.  You got any, like, uh...  I'm an effing man.  Are you?  That's a shame, man.  Well.  God.  Here's you in a couple of years.  I hate this place.  Meditations don't work.  Nothing else here.  You played the I hate this place, so didn't you?  I've been here for seven years.  I ain't here, though.  I was supposed to be aborted.  I hate you.  Oh, see you, Opie. 
[01:49:30]  My dad cheated twice.  Supposed to be aborted.  I hate this place.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to hear Anthony do Giuliani's thing.  Look what I did to you.  Get Adon at the refrigerator after a sec.  Look what I did to you again.  The whore.  Thanks.  I'm getting more kale now with prostate cancer than I ever did with you.  We're out of milk.  I'm shooting radioactive seeds.  Like a pea shooter that glows in the dark. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, that's crazy.  She's living in the house.  You know what she should do?  Bow out gracefully.  Leave.  She's trying to get the house.  It's Gracie.  She's trying to get the house.  It's Gracie Manchin.  She's just trying to get under his skin.  It's not a ranch out in Long Island somewhere.  It's Gracie Manchin.  You can't have it.  It's the next governor's got to, or the mayor's got to move in.  And she's trying to get the house. 
[01:50:30]  Because it's ingrained in their heads, Opie.  Get the house.  Mark.  Get the house.  Get the house.  Mark.  He's having sex with someone else.  Get the house.  Mark.  Holly wants a lawyer.  Mark.  No.  Hey, Bob.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah, so she's all pissed off.  Of course.  It's a rental.  Right.  It amounts to a rental.  Honey, the lease is up.  We don't own.  That's it.  Hey, Matt.  What's going on?  Move out.  Yeah, guys.  My mom once said to me, I should have kept the appointment. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, my God.  That's got to hurt.  It's tough.  It's all about.  I should have kept the appointment like it was made.  It was.  She just didn't go.  Yeah, exactly.  You know how close you came?  I feel loved.  You feel loved?  You're loved?  By who?  Yeah, how much does it cost every weekend to feel loved?  Please.  That is brutal.  You know, some parents can just say some nasty-ass stuff. 
[01:51:30]  You can't be pulling that on your kids, man.  And they do things like that to try to get back at the other parent.  You know, to use the kid as like the middleman thing.  Just evil.  Oh.  We've got to change gears a little bit.  And I wanted to know the answer to this question, too.  Andy, go ahead.  Oh, you're a massage parlor?  Yeah.  And the special release massage that worked on everybody.  Except you, Adam.  Yeah.  That's the question.  You ruined it for everyone.  You know, I...  Everyone was getting the, you know, the Yankee Cranky.  I didn't think the character should have gone in that direction. 
[01:52:00]  I really fought with the producers.  You know, he's more of a sensitive guy.  Well, I actually said, Tommy wouldn't do that.  Have you ever seen Tommy naked?  He's proud of it.  His motivation is to show it all.  I hate when actors talk in the third person about their character.  Whenever you see that goddamn...  Who's that actress that was banging every friggin' rock star around?  The one with the, uh...  Wynonna?  Wynonna.  Yeah.  Wynonna Ryder. 
[01:52:30]  She, whenever you hear her interview, she's like,  Well, I learned so much from her.  She's so sensitive.  And, you know, I learned so much from this girl.  It was you!  You're playing a part.  She's talking about it like it's someone else.  Ugh.  Don't ever do that, Adam.  Well, we did use a stunt penis.  Did you?  You know, so it really wasn't me.  Very good.  But, Adam, what was the problem?  What?  Why didn't you finish up?  Well, it was in the script that way. 
[01:53:00]  You gotta do what they say.  I don't tell you.  No, we didn't look at it that way.  Well, like, look at our pal, the King.  Come on, everyone remembers.  Whee!  Yankee Cranky.  You told the wee story on our show.  Yeah, the wee story.  Whee!  Yeah, it seems like you had a little input on that script.  No, believe me, it would have a lot different ending if I had any input on it.  What was the release method?  Was it manual?  Yeah.  Nice.  You ever been to the Yankee Cranky shows?  No, absolutely true.  I walked into one recently because I was overtired, and I walked into a Chinese place in Jersey, 
[01:53:30]  and it's the only legitimate massage parlor on the East Coast.  I get more volume from you guys than I got from her.  It was awful.  I got shiatsu.  You go in there, and you get a real massage.  I was so annoyed.  I'm all ready to tip.  I had money in my little robe.  Nothing.  All ready to tip.  Nothing.  Tips accepted.  Did you see the women after him?  What do you want from us?  Why don't you go home around us?  Yankee Cranky, please.  Yankee Cranky.  That was so irritating.  God damn. 
[01:54:00]  You see, a buck just locked in.  I had a buck.  That's not a man.  They have these places, though, and we always goof about it when we go to the sushi places,  that there's a chain of command for the girls that work in the sushi place.  The sushi place, after they bring you over on the boat illegally, and you're sold into  white slavery.  That's the job you try to work up to.  You work up to the sushi place.  Yeah.  And if you want it, you hold that job.  Because there's two levels beneath the sushi place.  The first one down is the nail place. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  You don't cut it in the sushi place.  You're doing the manicure.  You're cutting the nails.  Hey, girl, you want massage for it?  You're yanking out the white man's cuticle.  Yeah.  Then, the bottom of the rug.  Guess what you yank then?  Yankee Cranky.  Yankee Cranky.  For the girls that can't make it in that bed.  And you see sometimes at the sushi place, you know, we'll be sitting at certain sushi places.  We have a whole bit on this.  And the girl comes over, and she might screw up.  She might forget an order.  She might spill something.  And we're just looking.  What do we do?  We shake our head and go, uh-oh. 
[01:55:00]  Yankee Cranky.  She's going to the Yankee Cranky shop.  You scrub again.  You scrub again.  You go to Jack Jack.  Go.  Jack Jack.  We have the girls come over with their really thin, tiny wrists, and they're shaking as they  put the food down.  Like, oh, no.  You see some of the girls, the Asian girls, their wrists are like your pinky.  And they're shaking like Michael J. Fox trying to put down that goddamn sushi.  They're like, you can't even hold it.  And they put it down.  And you're like, how is that wrist going to hold up when she's got to do a manual release? 
[01:55:30]  Right.  And this guy, you know.  Well, maybe it's the other way.  Maybe she was doing the manual release.  That's the byproduct.  And now they just put her in it.  No, they build up the muscles doing that.  Really?  You go, you get your ass, you're back to Japan or China, wherever they came from.  Where, Heady.  Uh, Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  We went down to a, uh, one of them little places in, uh, Queens somewhere for a massage.  And, uh, funniest thing, Chinese massage parlor, right?  So we get done.  And the chick goes, oh, you want happy ending?  Happy ending?  Funny. 
[01:56:00]  You want happy ending?  What's so good?  Happy ending, they call it?  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  We want to give you a happy ending.  Better be calling it low main.  Well, yeah.  And when you walk in, they give you the wink and they go, oh, you want special massage?  You want special?  That would be the greatest thing I've ever heard.  You want happy ending.  Happy ending.  That's what they call the, uh, the, uh, free dessert you get for, like, a buck at Friendly's.  If you get, like, a platter, you get the happy ending dessert.  I got a fribble in my pants. 
[01:56:30]  All right, we got to take a break.  Now, do you pay before when you go in for the massage?  Yeah, $70.  She'd get really strong.  So it's 70, but how much would it have been?  Oh, she worked.  An hour, it was a real, I don't know how much it would have been, but I had, like, an extra  80.  You were going to give her 80 bucks?  No, just to touch the, you know, I believe it would have been a little bit more involved.  Just to touch the side.  How much is it to flick the head?  20 bucks if you flick the head?  How much to throw your web, though? 
[01:57:00]  To what?  To throw your web.  What is that?  Happy ending.  Throwing web.  Throwing web.  Oh, that's great.  Probably an extra 40, but I would have, because I was over time.  That was the day I shot Spider-Man.  I'm like, that's the way to treat yourself.  Throwing web.  Throwing web.  Yeah.  What a coincidence.  Yeah, yeah, I just humiliate myself all over my belly, but she wouldn't do it, so that  was the end of that.  I was disgusted.  So wait a minute, this would have cost you 110 bucks?  Probably, yeah.  It depends on what you wanted.  I would have given it.  For a handy?  Well, I would have gotten a little more than that.  I would have touched the back.  I like to touch the handy while I'm being...  Do you like that? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  What do they charge for that?  I don't know, but I couldn't find out.  She gave me no vibes at all.  Mikey?  Yeah?  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  A bunch of us guys play softball all the time down in New Jersey.  There's one of your good time places down there.  Queen of Australia.  Down in Lodi, New Jersey.  Everybody goes to Lodi after the games, and they call it body shampoo.  Everybody's got to get a body shampoo afterwards.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, this one place is the best place everybody wants to go to. 
[01:58:00]  We're all at home watching the news one night.  The top's ready to hold the place.  They're marching people out of there in robes.  Thank God there was no softball tournament down there.  Oh.  They would have missed the whole team out.  Wow.  And they call it a body shampoo.  Everybody's got to go get a poo.  Yes.  And they love grabbing the yam bag, you know?  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wonderful.  Did they, like, put down, like, that paper on the thing?  Like the doctors pull it out?  Yeah.  The doctor paper?  No.  They didn't.  Not for this one. 
[01:58:30]  No?  I don't know how they do it in the better places, but not in this.  In the better places.  Yeah, the real places.  Why?  You had the paper?  Like a doctor's office at it?  I'm trying to remember.  I had the doctor's office paper.  Like, you know when you were a kid and went to the school nurse?  It was a big brown couch.  Yeah, but they'd pull the paper.  You'd get up on there.  It's all crinkling.  Yeah.  The mood music was 1010 Winds, news radio, traffic on the 8th.  Nice.  I went off right when there was a clog at the Holland Conk.  Adam getting a handy.  I'm John Moncone. 
[01:59:00]  He's backed up.  Oh, it's cleared.  The tunnel is cleared.  Everything's flowing nicely.  That's what you want, though.  You want some desperate immigrant who knows if she doesn't do her job right,  they're going to drown her children in the tub.  Drown them like kids.  I didn't get that.  I got an old.  I got like a Mr. Miyagi-looking lady.  Oh, jeez.  I swear to God, no neck, big cans, and I know what I was into.  Look at eye, Adam, son.  Look at eye.  Focus power.  I've been here 20 minutes.  I show you wax on, wax off. 
[01:59:30]  Try to aim for a cup.  Very good, Adam.  It is now time for the K-Dawg Week in Review.  Science.  Just tell me what you've learned about Earth.  Follow this logic.  Sonar from the submarines is affecting the whale's mood for sex.  You're saying that sonar should be stopped because it's affecting the whales. 
[02:00:00]  It's affecting the mating call.  You idiot.  What do we need sonar for all?  Anyway, all of a sudden it's going boop, boop.  Hey, your head goes boop, boop.  Get out.  If we ever go to war again, we want stealth.  Duh.  So sonar makes noise that we should be silent.  Otherwise, only Russians or any Cubans or the Japs.  They might detect us.  Okay, stop.  And then it's all over, Johnny.  He is certifiably an idiot.  You dumb ass. 
[02:00:30]  Science.  Science.  You stupid ass.  Because if we send out a sonar beam saying, you know, I love you, I want you, to a whale,  the whale's going to come over and think that the submarine is another whale and might go to town.  What the hell are you talking about?  Thank you for the education.  He's either the best comedy writer of our time, or he's this stupid, huh?  WNEW. 
[02:01:00]  It's all over, Johnny.  Ah.  Boop, boop.  1027 WNEW is the sports guys at 5 a.m., the radio chick at 9, Ron and Fez at noon,  Opie and Anthony at 3, Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special, Ron and Fez.  Fez faces the unknown.  All right, Fez, you can do it.  Ronnie, I've never done this before.  I don't think I can.  Yes, you can, Fez, and it'll be good for you.  What is this thing even called?  It's called a salad. 
[02:01:30]  Why doesn't it taste like meat?  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez, middays, noon to 3, 1027 WNEW.  Anthony, Worldwide Monkeygram.  Yes, the fine people at Worldwide Monkeygram have several varieties of Mother's Day monkeys  for customers to choose from.  Each monkey, they got the chimp, it's black.  The gibbon they have is white.  And the orangutan, marmalade.  Marmalade colored.  It has a baby, each one that can be added. 
[02:02:00]  For example, dads can send mom a chimp with babies to match the number of children she has.  The mom monkeys can have garland or flowers.  And a Mother's Day ribbon included.  Another Mother's Day package, the orangutan, mom, with baby orangutan.  And a copy of the video, Orangutans with Julia Roberts.  I don't get that.  I don't know why that's funny to me, but it is.  Or how about breakfast for mom?  That includes Worldwide Monkey Pure Maple Syrup and Pancake Mix. 
[02:02:30]  All Monkeygrams start at $39.99.  So call them up in easy-to-remember number, 1-800-8585-101.  Send a monkey to your mom with a message that reads,  From your little monkey, Claire.  And maybe even when she gets it, sing the monkey song.  I had a little monkey.  His name was Tiny Tim.  I put him in the bathtub to see if he could swim.  How does it go?  Uh, I had a little monkey. 
[02:03:00]  Okay, thank you, Claire.  Worldwide Monkey, 1-800-8585-101.  Or reach him on the web, WorldwideMonkey.net.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  101-7-WNEW.  A little taste of the new one from Nine Inch Nails, Anthony.  That's deep. 
[02:03:30]  It's going to be on the Tomb Raider soundtrack.  That's out in a couple of weeks.  CO&A Show, 212-757-1027.  Let's get right to the phones.  Bobby has a question for Norton, I think.  Hey, what's up, Norton?  What's up, buddy?  I saw you down at Club Chrome.  You rocked.  Oh, thank you, man.  And when's the next time you're going to be playing around here, since you're there?  I'm doing, actually, West Orange Rascals this Thursday with Rich Voss and Otto and George.  Ah, no kidding.  One night only, yeah.  Three scumbags and a puppet, pretty much. 
[02:04:00]  The number there, I have to give the number, it's 973-736-2726.  On Thursday night, one show only.  And I've got another question for you.  Sure.  Are you going to be with Otto and George?  Are you going to be with him at the Stress Factory this month?  To be honest with you, no.  I don't know when he's at the Stress Factory.  All right, Bobby.  Thanks, Scott.  Bye.  Bye.  Cool.  Another fan.  There you go.  Someone from Flushing wrote, after Norton berates them and makes them cry, they can redeem themselves 
[02:04:30]  by bobbing for dignity.  Nice callback.  If we do the teen weakest link, though.  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to that.  One of the best Norton lines ever.  Bobbing for dignity.  Let me go to Paul, who's gay and has a problem.  Paul, what's your problem, Paul?  Hey, what's the whole deal with the overprotective mother?  I'm a gay listener, and I didn't have an overprotective mother.  And I'm gay.  Sure you did.  No, wrong.  Think outside the box, will ya? 
[02:05:00]  Think outside the box?  That's what your problem is.  You're living way outside of it, my friend.  Look, that's not true.  Think inside the box.  You have a lot of gay listeners.  That's okay.  Don't alienate them.  Why, you guys can't take a joke?  Well, I think it's just, you know, it's the stereotype going over.  No, sorry.  Bye.  Anyway, young lady.  Oh.  Hey.  Sorry.  We have no problem.  Cut it out.  Watch the mouth.  I apologize.  I apologize.  The bad words.  Watch the mouth. 
[02:05:30]  I know.  I apologize.  Paul, we stereotype a lot of things.  I know.  I'm just being, I guess I'm being an over-sensitive fag about this, huh?  See?  I love you guys.  Not too much.  Well, no, I've seen you actually, too.  Oh, great.  I love the gay guys.  I already saw you on TV.  What's going on with that gem?  I saw you when you were doing that WWF stuff.  Hold on.  Paul, if you want to abuse us, that's one thing. 
[02:06:00]  We don't have guts, though.  There's so many other things to pick up on.  There's so many other things to pick up on.  We don't have the guts.  All right.  Oh, please.  Hey, how is that gem thing going?  Is that dusted off or are you using it?  Jim or Bob or Pete?  I'm going to go.  See ya.  All right.  I got to go.  There's a C I got to put my mouth on.  And you're still working out, right?  Oh, yeah.  With your home gym?  Look at me.  I'm pumped.  See me?  So you don't need to use it anymore, right? 
[02:06:30]  I just hurt myself.  I'm making a muscle.  Has it become a coagrass yet?  No, Opie.  It hasn't.  And I still use it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why not?  Next week it'll end up in our office.  Just because we're not.  I feel like the foosball table.  I know.  Everything that...  Yeah.  Everything Anthony doesn't like anymore ends up in our office.  I couldn't use the foosball table in my apartment.  So now it's in the office.  And we got to set it up somewhere.  But there's no room in our office.  We don't have room for it.  So I don't know what to do with it.  I would love to play a little foosball before the show. 
[02:07:00]  I know.  Hey, Mike has a problem with the job.  Okay.  What?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Did we lose you?  Hey.  Hello.  He said I was on the pilot.  He was on the pilot of the job.  Oh.  And he had something about the Yankee Cranky episode.  Fellow actor.  Adam.  Hello?  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  Oh, I remember, Mark.  Mark called about two hours ago, Anthony. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  He wants tool tickets really bad.  Uh-huh.  I do believe we could get some if you have something interesting for the show.  Yeah.  I got some good ideas, and my girlfriend got some really disgusting ideas.  All right.  Yeah.  Because he said, look, my girlfriend will get naked if you guys give us tool tickets.  We're like naked.  Geez.  We need a little more than that.  Right, Norton?  You're also a good start.  Yeah.  Well, naked's always cool.  Oh, she'll still get naked.  Then what happens?  Yeah.  All right.  One of three different options.  First one is my suggestion.  You guys, I get naked, carry some signs down the street. 
[02:08:00]  What?  See, anything with you naked, you totally know.  What are the other two?  Mark?  The other one is getting a cell phone that works.  Right.  That's a good idea.  Mark?  We'll go with that one.  Now he's got a call back.  Yeah.  Yeah, when we said good ideas for your chick, besides just getting naked, it didn't mean involve you.  We told him to think about it for two hours.  He comes back with, I'll get naked and walk around the block with signs.  How about that?  You walk around the block naked with a sign while your girlfriend puts her hiney in my face. 
[02:08:30]  That's fair.  Everybody goes home happy.  No argument here.  Keith.  Hey, Keith.  Hey, it's Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, if you get rid of that big desk, you can set up the foosball table.  Opie's big oval office desk.  Yeah, we get rid of the big desk.  I think we have room for the foosball table.  No, we've got to talk to the boss about knocking that wall down.  Now, there's only one person that now uses that area.  You know the receptionist? 
[02:09:00]  One of the girls are now in the front lobby area.  They put the receptionist in the hallway.  In the hallway, but they made it look like a lobby area now.  Yeah, it's a nice L-shaped desk.  That makes you feel good about your job.  You had a nice cubicle near the boss's office and stuff, and they...  No, they put you in the hallway.  Moving in the hallway.  And then they paint it and give you new furniture and say,  No, look, it's a lobby.  It's nice.  This is nice.  The purple room.  She's under stairs.  You're right, Rick.  Yeah.  She's under the stairs.  Under the stairs they put her.  We're very happy with your work here. 
[02:09:30]  Get out.  Get under the stairs.  I can't look at you.  So now the cubicle isn't being used by anyone but our own Black Earl.  That's right.  So that space is now deemed a complete waste of space.  Because...  That's funny.  Only Earl.  So if we could get Earl out of there, we could blast that wall out.  Yeah, we're expanding again.  We could blast the wall out.  When we got here three years ago, they gave us like a tiny, tiny, tiny office.  Now we have the boss's office.  I'm even thinking you just blow out half the wall and then move it over to where Jeremy's office starts. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  So they could still put a little cubicle area right by our door, but we'll have a whole playroom.  Mm-hmm.  Whole area for the foosball table, some video games.  I like it.  Asian chicks.  Yankee Cranky, full release, happy endings, whatever you want to call them, on the foosball table.  You know what a really happy ending is?  Is if you release and then her head blows off.  But we want them to knock the wall down, right? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  When can that happen?  As soon as we sign that little contract thing.  Oh, that thing.  When is that going to happen?  Three and a half weeks to go.  It's going to get interesting.  Mark, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Sorry about that.  I'm on a landline now.  Okay.  Here you go.  He's the guy back with his girlfriend who wants to get naked.  What's option two?  He needs something better for the sole thing.  Here's the tool that wants tool tickets.  Yes, Mark.  Exactly.  All right.  Option two, this was her idea.  She wants to get naked, take a strap on and do various different things to me in front 
[02:11:00]  of you guys, or whatever, wherever you guys want.  Why on earth would we want to see that?  Mark, you're naked in all these ideas.  Exactly.  I don't want to be.  These are her ideas.  What's the other idea?  The other idea, again, was hers, was me going down on the top of Patty.  You guys got to say no to that one.  Boy, there's no anger in that relationship.  Well, we actually broke up last night.  That would actually be brutal.  How lame are you that you broke up last night and you're trying to get your ex-girlfriend  now, uh, tool tickets?  Dude, I want to go with some tool.  You'll understand.  I'll let you guys both sleep with her for these tickets. 
[02:11:30]  That's an option.  But he's telling us earlier how completely hot she is.  Oh, she's gorgeous, dude.  I mean, this is like, I've been with the girl since she was like two weeks after she  turned 18 until like last night.  Yeah, Mark, you've got to continue thinking.  Yeah, that's not quite working.  You kind of haven't hit it yet.  Can you guys give me a hint?  Well, you can't be naked.  Yeah, exactly.  You, not naked.  I don't even have to be in the studio.  You have to do whatever you want to.  You naked out of the equation.  What can your chick do with various parts of a body that would be entertaining for us 
[02:12:00]  and our listeners?  Yeah.  She shoot a ping pong ball or something?  Yeah, we had the girl that shot the bottle rocket.  We had the egg tossing, which was very good.  We've got to bring back the egg tossing.  Egg toss is great.  You want to do the egg toss?  Hear about that, Norton?  No.  Girl came in here and was able to put an egg somewhere, fire it out like a cannon.  And we had a blind guy catching him in an Easter basket.  And we took batting practice.  Oh, that's so great.  You should shoot an egg? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, and then we were hitting it with the wiffle ball bat.  The move's about to run!  Oh, exactly.  Fire!  She had it down.  She had it down.  She had kind of a hip thing going and also shooting it at the same time.  Felt like the Duke in World War II movie, loading up a mortar.  I hope you can shoot it straight up in there and catch it again.  Yeah, that would be good.  That's good.  Joe, talk into the mic.  That's something to gun for.  I'm not used to it.  Tell your girlfriend to get a dozen eggs and stretch.  Bring her in here.  Yeah, can she do that? 
[02:13:00]  I put my holes in this thing for a second.  Can she do the egg thing?  Yeah.  She cannot do that.  Dude, it might be funnier seeing her trying.  It's just going to dribble out.  Great.  I'm there.  Is that cool?  It takes a special girl to do the egg thing.  Trust me, she's got power.  Look, we can make it a competition.  If she comes down here and she can get it to go even two feet.  A lot of people shaking their heads.  No?  I'm telling you, dude.  Your girl cannot do the egg trick. 
[02:13:30]  But she's got to get it to fire two feet and then you get the tickets.  What about that?  On Monday, that sounds perfect.  What's the matter, Rick?  This guy's a tool.  This guy's a complete tool.  Give us your girlfriend's phone number.  We're talking to her because I think you're wasting our time.  He is.  Because no one's going to happen.  You're going to call your girlfriend.  She's going to go, I ain't doing that.  And then we just wasted an hour with you.  Then he's going to show up and say, well, can you give me the tickets anyway?  Hold on.  Let Rick get her number and we'll call her up.  Wait, how about this?  How about she puts an arrow in her balloon knot and tries to shoot an apple off my head like William Tell? 
[02:14:00]  I watched that, too.  All right, Mark, hold on.  Rick's going to talk to you off air.  This will be a complete waste of time, I guarantee you.  Right, right.  Your girlfriend will be on the line in about ten minutes and she's going to say, no way am I doing that.  Nothing works here.  We are.  All right, we should tell people next week we start our next little game called Mommy, What Would You Do for NSYNC Tickets?  And that's always fun.  That's where we got the bottle rocket shooting woman.  Yeah.  And that's something we need.  And the mother-daughter queefing team. 
[02:14:30]  And that was Norton Twiceless.  Mother-daughter.  A 14-year-old daughter and her mom doing queefing together.  Isn't that nice when a family can get together and learn things.  It was.  Well, the girl, the 14-year-old girl sounded like a piccolo.  Right.  And the mother was just a tuba.  It was the most disgusting thing.  Oh, it's like Close Encounters.  Yeah.  It was. 
[02:15:00]  It was a piccolo.  One of the funniest things ever, man.  Take it, Ma.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  It was classic.  No way.  What?  What?  You know why we can't talk to her?  Why?  Because this really hot girlfriend that Mark has doesn't have a phone because she lives in a trail.  Oh, stop.  He's so full of crap.  Mark.  Yeah.  You're such a tool.  I swear to God.  You're so full of crap.  We used to work together.  She moved into a trailer. 
[02:15:30]  I can't live there.  It's like two blocks away, dude.  It's in Eaton Town, New Jersey.  I'll bring the phone.  My cell there.  It's charging right now.  I'll bring it right over to her house.  And I didn't support her.  She doesn't even work.  She's getting a job.  Cut our losses.  Bring your phone.  Cut our losses.  I don't know.  I like a girl that lives in a trailer.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They'll do a lot for somebody.  That's good.  It's easy to pick up girls like that.  We learned yesterday that it's easy to pick up crazy chicks. 
[02:16:00]  So, we were talking about, did we watch that Bellevue special that was on HBO?  You're talking to Norton.  You're preaching to the choir.  Yeah.  Everyone attracted to a sexual and mental problem.  He takes ice cream sandwiches and hangs around the retarded home.  Trailer girls do wrong.  Oh, you just hold a book in front of them and rave them while they're mesmerized.  Well, they're mesmerized, huh?  Oh, that's nice.  Those girls and the, yeah, the insane. 
[02:16:30]  The insane are easy.  I love them.  You just tell them you're from Krypton.  And you'll stop the voices in their head and keep the aliens away from the tinfoil hat they're wearing if you suck my seat.  Swallow it.  It's magic juice.  It's your medication.  Cartoon characters come out of that.  There was a trailer park girl in western New York when I was living up there.  They nicknamed her Hoover.  I understand why.  Big fan of the president. 
[02:17:00]  And she bragged that one minute tops, no matter who you are.  And everyone will give it a try.  Really?  One minute tops.  Everyone lost.  Like the rodeo.  And everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone lost.  I have never had a girl be able to do that to me in a minute.  Believe me, if I did, you'd get a ring.  I have never been able to finish that.  Nickname was Hoover.  I like that.  How fat was she?  Yeah, she was a little chubby.  They try harder, though.  Good calling, by the way. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, well, you got it.  If you're the Hoover, a minute time like that.  Oh, she was proud of it.  Proud?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And what?  All you'd have to say is, all right, I'll try.  I'm in.  All right, damn it.  I'll put the effort in.  I'll try.  I'm from Missouri.  You got to show me.  I was upstate New York.  Think about the ones that you get down in North Carolina when I was in the Army.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  A minute?  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about, like, the entire company.  All of Charlie Company, like, within a week's span. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  I love that.  Got it.  You parachuted in, didn't you?  That's right.  Your days of finger-banging, old-carrying button socks to her purdy-pig patties are over.  All right, Sarge.  That's the greatest.  Gary Sargent Hartman, he could be the finest man ever.  Isn't he great?  Yeah.  I got a question for Norton.  Yes.  When she's doing the, and teeth are involved, what do you do?  Stop or keep going?  Always stop.  You stay still. 
[02:18:30]  You don't say a word.  I would think you would not say a word.  No, no.  It's very unpleasant.  I usually just, you know, sometimes you have to remove the apparatus from the mouth and  ask them to do a little, you know, bagged.  You know, go ahead, lap it like a little lamb, and then you just finish yourself off, give  yourself a happy ending, and then you strangle her with piano wire for not doing it right.  Like a little lamb.  Yeah.  You know, I've had teeth many times, and it irritates me. 
[02:19:00]  It really bugs me.  Well, that's boss.  I'm very surprised.  I thought you would deal with that.  No, I don't care for it at all.  No.  I don't care for it.  And if you've never had teeth, you have a little mule.  Guys, if you've never had teeth, have little mules.  A lot of people think the front teeth are the problem.  No, it's the molars.  It's like, if you want to raise an example, like a fine film like Slap Happy.  Right.  Slap Happy.  We were so happy that we talked about Slap Happy on the air. 
[02:19:30]  I emailed all of you.  I couldn't get over.  You don't understand how those things should be winning Golden Globe Awards.  You don't understand how much I love the Slap Happy.  Oh, it's great.  We got it.  We got to explain.  Yeah, the Slap Happy movies.  We've just screened a few in the office, and it's these chicks who have no problem with  this.  It's not like they're taken against their will.  And these guys degrade them.  They smack them in the face, smack them with their junk, and then proceed to take their 
[02:20:00]  junk and thrust it so far and so hard that the girls vomit all over them.  And then they're like, gagging.  And the guy's like, you take it, bitch.  Pulls her hair and just pulls it in.  And you just hear, bleh.  And then he puts it right back in.  Right back.  And then stretches.  Do you ever see where he posts the inside of her cheek?  Yeah.  And stretches her mouth out so far and hard it looks like it's going to rip.  Relax, Norton.  Yeah.  Norton's just getting so wound up. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Sexy.  I saw them in a booth for the first time, the slap-happies, and I'm like, well, here's  a purchase.  They're phenomenal.  I got one.  Slap-happies.  Oh, they're great.  He slaps them.  This guy's like a glass.  Yes.  He's macking.  And she's puking all over her chest and all over his junk.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And then right back.  I don't think that happens all the time.  What?  They're making movies about it?  I love it.  Phenomenal.  But he must get a lot of teeth.  It's just like, all over and right back in.  And it's just so brutal and so far that you've got to know he's getting a little chewed up. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, but he's got a mule, too, this guy.  You've got to respect him.  He's got to have...  This guy's not packing fine.  You've got to respect him.  This guy's got to have nine and angry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And angry.  And he gets like, he loves when the girls start going like, little gagging.  And he holds the bottom of their head.  He just grabs, like, it isn't even connected to her body.  He'll grab under her jaw and the top of her head and just work himself.  She looks like she has a mumps.  With her head.  A mumps. 
[02:21:30]  A mumps, yeah.  And he'll just work her head until she vomits.  Oh, my God.  It's so nasty.  Adam, it is so out there.  So out there.  Man, it's great.  On top of that, he writes the C word on her forehead.  And let's take it.  Yeah.  That's just rude.  And she says how much she, you know, she is a C.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a C.  Joni, a girl.  A girl's on the line that wants to talk about Slap Happy.  Joni.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:22:00]  So I've seen the Slap Happy ones.  Yeah.  You know the human toilet one?  No.  Human toilet?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So there's this, like, human toilet.  Well, each one has its own theme, apparently.  And, like, one, they just, like, write all nasty things on the girls.  And then there's, like, the human toilet one where she has, like, a toilet seat on her head.  And then he's like, are you a good girl?  And she's like, I'm your good little toilet.  It's really bad.  I'm your good little toilet.  And then what does he do?  And then, hmm, how can I say this?  And then he...  All right, wait.  Is it number one or number two? 
[02:22:30]  Well, no.  It's not number one.  It's, like, the happy ending.  All right.  Happy ending in the toilet.  And then...  But she has to wait.  And she has to wait for him to flush.  She's actually referring to Slap Happy Volume 3.  Oh, Steve, the Slap Happy connoisseur.  Because there are so many unanswered questions on him.  It's Slap Happy Volume 2.  Yeah.  It left me just wanting a sequel.  How did you feel about the film?  Did you enjoy it?  Yeah.  I mean...  They know.  They're really good. 
[02:23:00]  How did you get turned on to the Slap Happy series there, Joanie?  Well, actually, a friend of ours turned us on to it about maybe a month ago.  So I was so shocked when you guys started talking about it.  I was like, oh, my God.  I can't believe somebody else knows about this.  But he just got the Volume 4.  You should know about this.  All right, Volume 4.  Yeah, Volume 4.  And he said that it's, like, really good, like, half the whole way through.  Except, like, at the end, one of the girls starts, like, crying.  And so he gets all upset.  And, like, he actually, like, decides to do Slap Happy light now. 
[02:23:30]  So I didn't know if you guys have seen 4 yet.  Why?  You see a whole series of them crying.  That's the best part.  Oh, I know, I know.  So, like, a...  Oh, you know, you know.  Do you have a boyfriend?  Yeah.  Volume 5.  A very special Slap Happy.  What Christmas Slap Happy.  What's interesting about these videos, as they get further down the progression, Slap Happy,  one, two, three, four, the disclaimers before each one of these scenes gets longer.  Yeah.  The last one I saw, he interviews them for five minutes before each scene, saying,  you know exactly what you're doing.  You're doing this of your own volition. 
[02:24:00]  Uh-huh.  How old are you?  What's your real name?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Down the line, and then he proceeds to trash them and just do all that stuff that she says.  Has he ever asked the question, I'd like to talk to Helen.  Can Helen come out?  And at one point, this girl gets, in one scene, gets so shaken up that she's crying,  and the mascara's running into her mouth because she's been crying so hard.  Oh, that's the blonde girl, right?  And she gets so mad at the end, and, like, he goes back afterwards. 
[02:24:30]  I wasn't paying that close attention.  Norton has love in his eyes.  I have not seen it.  Your eyes are sparkling with love.  I feel like I'm talking to my soulmate.  You're right.  Yeah.  Imagine you two go out, maybe a little dinner, some sodomy against someone's will,  and then back home for slap hat.  July, I'm there.  What's that?  It's been July.  I'll be at Rascal's West Orange this coming Thursday if you'd care to come and have your throat violated.  If brutality's not your thing, I'm at Governor's. 
[02:25:00]  You'd be like those couples that go cross-country just raping and pillaging.  I love you, Mickey.  Right, yeah.  Oh, you two are made for each other.  This is kismet.  Yeah, well, there's a lot of us out there, I think.  Is there such a thing as felonious kismet, because I think that would fall into that category.  I'm telling you, I attract dirty girls.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, I like it.  Nice.  You're the best, Norton.  This is great.  All right, Joni, thank you.  All right, bye-bye.  All right. 
[02:25:30]  Well, look at that.  Make sure you vote for the whipped cream bikini contest.  A girl that likes slap hat.  Oh, that's right.  That's a little, uh...  That's a chick that you would not have to go to the movies to see Bridges of Madison County with.  No.  Yeah.  That's just great.  Yeah.  There's not a lot of what-about-my-needs conversations.  Are you mad at me?  You haven't used me as a toilet in two weeks.  You haven't written a C-word on my head so long.  Are you serious? 
[02:26:00]  Oh, God.  It's me.  We got some good stuff for the dump sheet tonight.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Uh, yeah, quickly, just if you haven't, vote, uh, for the whipped cream bikini contest.  They're hot.  Yeah, let me look now.  Got to vote every day.  Three girls are out of the contest, uh, by short time tomorrow.  Two more will be done.  I like that one.  Which one is that one?  You like her?  Yeah.  Which one?  Uh, I don't want to give it away, or, or, I don't want to taint the audience's vote. 
[02:26:30]  I don't think it'll happen.  All right.  Uh, you like, uh, Celia.  I like Celia.  I like Celia.  Celia's got big, round...  Yes, I like her.  ...implants.  Norton, which one do you think can take a punch?  Go.  So, go to WNEW.com and follow the instructions.  It's important to vote every day, guys.  Okay?  Okay.  It is now time for the K-Dog Week in Review.  Hello, I'm...  I'm...  ...Science. 
[02:27:00]  I just say whatever I want.  Follow this logic.  Nine new planets were found by scientists, but they're not in our solar system yet.  Now, think about this logic.  We have nine planets within our solar system, right?  Uh-huh.  Mars, Earth, Saturn, Jupiter...  Stupidity.  Uranus, Pluto, Neptune, and, uh...  Shut up, dammit!  Stupidity.  I, I, I, I don't know the other two.  There are nine planets in the other solar system, so I believe that is in the equilibrium. 
[02:27:30]  Okay, you beat it!  Basically, like, in, uh, Bizarro Land.  I know it may look like I'm going off into, uh, another intelligent tangent here.  I'm gonna bet a gazillion dollars you're wrong on this.  You idiot.  No, Sam!  Sorry.  In Bizarro, everything is, is the exact same except for opposites.  Follow this logic.  How do you bring me a planet?  We have nine planets.  We live everything the way we live.  The other solar system, nine planets, that's the sameness. 
[02:28:00]  Sam!  You useless puss-tule!  The differentness is that, uh, they do things probably differently than we do.  Different little, uh, quirky, quirky, quirky.  What a nod!  What an idiot!  I believe that the third planet from the sun also has life form on it.  That is probably, is intelligent, is intelligent, so I think that we should go research this.  But, be careful because of pressurization from gold from solar system to solar system.  It's a different atmosphere. 
[02:28:30]  You never, never know.  Andrew from Jersey.  Aren't you guys breaking some sort of child labor laws by employing a 12-year-old retarded boy and allowing him to go on the air?  We are in identical, symmetritized solar system things.  Can I step over and beat the living crap out of him so the smart one is getting the hell beat out of him on the other planet?  I was trying to start a thought, but it just left my mind.  Thank you for the education.  He's either the best comedy writer of our time, or he's this stupid.  Don't!

[02:31:30]  Bar 9.  That's Bar 9.  9th between 53rd and 54th.  What's that?  Your new, uh, the new home of Jill Buck?  It is, actually.  For at least, uh, at least for the next, uh, couple of months.  Yeah?  Yeah, every Tuesday night I'll be there.  Jesus, man.  Last time I went.  I don't know what it is.  I don't, I don't do shots.  But no one would ever believe that from the past three times I've gone out.  And it's, it's the Jägermeister.  You were rock blessed.  I know. 
[02:32:00]  Saturday at the, uh, board party?  Don't.  Oh.  Oh.  I forgot.  Someone actually had to remind me, uh, Ant, you and your brother and Lynch and everything  were doing wholehearted extreme tunes on stage.  And then I remembered somebody blurted out as a goof.  Do some extreme.  And starts laughing.  Right.  Joe?  They don't know this.  Joe plays anything.  And just from driving around, I can usually remember words to just about everything. 
[02:32:30]  At least pieces of it.  So he started doing it.  And I was like, oh my God, they're doing extreme tunes.  We got a good chunk of it, too.  It doesn't matter what someone can yell out.  We'll know some of it.  Sing some paper lace.  You know what Lynch was talking about?  He was talking about Can't You See, that old Marshall Tucker tune.  Oh, yes.  That was excellent.  Yeah, that was definitely.  Blasted right out, too.  We were, oh my God.  I heard the party was great.  It rocked.  Lynch and Dina Cole again.  I hear that. 
[02:33:00]  Who's that?  I'm gay.  I am gay.  You hear that, everyone?  I'm gay.  Never be here, sit this here.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yeah.  That's a winner  But it doesn't matter what the tune is 
[02:33:30]  Then you gotta get goofed on when you do it  Howdy  Bang it  Hey  I'm Big Dick Black  You're a girl  You're a bitch  I can't 
[02:34:00]  Wish somebody put this retard out of his misery  Yeah, all rocking with a string  Not for that  Howdy, faggot  Nice  It doesn't matter  I won't be doing any of that this evening  Very good  Thank you  Hey, I want to back up a little bit  Because Norton was talking about  How they're canceling Mother's Day  Yeah 
[02:34:30]  At that school where?  On the Upper West Side?  Yeah, where are we?  Some private school  I didn't mention the name  But, you know, to be all-inclusive  So everybody feels okay  Yeah, so it's not just Mother's Day  They were afraid of the whole Mother's Day thing  Not including everybody  Or Father's Day  They won't  Yes, no more Father's Day either  Because they don't want the kids to feel different  You know, like you don't feel different  When you go home  And you see two mommies  Rolling around on the floor  Yeah  Yeah, that's the reason they're doing it  Because of these families 
[02:35:00]  That have two moms or two dads  Instead of the mom and the dad thing  Yeah  Both mommies are guys  There's a problem  Yeah, exactly  Irritating  When you double up on Father's Day  You still got two  You still got two holidays  That's the one you don't see that much  Is the two dad  You know, sure, you see the after-school specials about it  But that whole situation just kind of freaks me out a little bit  There's always one daddy that likes to tuck in a little more than the other one does  You know, that's the one that's just 
[02:35:30]  The two mommies thing  It's kind of hot  Yeah  Unless when you start really thinking of the reality of it  As Rosie O'Donnell and her lover  And the little kids, you know  When you think of hot lipstick lesbians  Sure, that's fine  Yeah, two daddies  That hasn't happened really yet  In Hollywood or anything  Well, they don't usually give up  Because obviously they're not going to have them themselves  Yeah  And, you know, the lesbian couples can get a  Somebody from Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  To knock them up and have a kid that way  So you don't usually see the two daddies  It's funny though 
[02:36:00]  When you get the two lesbian couples  It's real easy to get sperm  Either any guy is willing to give that up  Guys are just willing to donate  Not really a commodity  But then, you ever hear the cases  Where they got the lesbian couple  This used to happen a lot years back  And they have a kid  Or adopt a kid  And the kid's taken away  Because there's a lesbian couple  And they usually give it to one of the mothers  Of the lesbians  When they split?  Yeah  Or not only when they split  Like if someone deems  Oh my God  This is a horrible environment for a child to live in 
[02:36:30]  And they give it to the mother  You just gave the kid to someone who raised a lesbian  You know what?  You have the sense in that  This guy swears he has two dads  I'm not buying it  But Todd  No, it's Pat  Pat?  Pat  Yeah  Oh, hey, what's going on, guys?  You have two dads  Yeah, my dad and my mom split up  When I was like five  Okay  And I found out he was gay  When I was like twelve, dude  You have two dads  Yeah, I swear to God, man  So you found out he was gay? 
[02:37:00]  Yep  When I was in like fifth grade  What, did he have a little talk with you?  Yeah  I was like, uh, Dad  Yo, what's up with not having any girlfriends?  And he was like, uh, well  I have some of the bad sex  Yeah, I swear to God  It's crazy  So wait, you went to live  They split up when you were twelve  You went to live with your father and his boyfriend?  I live with him right now  I'm homo-boking  Homo-boking, as I referred to  Well, wait a minute  Well, how did you know?  How did you know?  Did you see him like at the father's stage?  Mommy has a penis  How did you know?  Was he playing the potato sack race 
[02:37:30]  With another guy's bags?  No, they just like split up  And then like one day  I just got curious  And I was like  Yo, Dad, what's up?  Alright, how old are you?  Uh, twenty-one  And you've been living with him since you were twelve?  No, no  I just started living with him  I live with my mom for a while  But I live with him now  You know, I'd really like it  If you'd call Steve's mom  And he's around in the house  With another guy  And they're  Yeah, they've been together for like nine years  I gotta ask  I mean, how skeeved out  Do you get when they're like  Cuddling on the couch and stuff?  They're not 
[02:38:00]  Actually, they're not really like that bad like that  What do they do in front of you?  No, I've actually only seen them kiss once  And I was like  Ugh  Like, I mean, I'm cool with it, dude  But like, that's my dad, man  I don't know  It's kind of weird  But no, they're totally cool  Uh-oh  Like, was it a peck?  Or was it a real like kiss?  Yeah  Kiss  Once in a while it's a little wacky  But, you know, it's all right  Thank you for the A-love last night, kiss  Forget about it, dude  You have a fag dad  You got hooked up on clothes  On clothes?  Dude, I'm rocking your $200 sunglasses right now 
[02:38:30]  If someone isn't making  Taking bananas and making banana juice out of it  Look at you  I bet  I bet you're never naked in your own home  No  Yeah, is your dad's boyfriend eyeing you?  No, no, it's not like that  You know what another good thing is?  Did you bring a girl over to the house?  You know the fag dad?  Dude, I get  I swear to God  My dad has got me laid like 20 times  He's like, oh, you're so fabulous  Like, they're like, oh my God 
[02:39:00]  Your dad's gay  You're so cool  I'm like, hell yeah  It's a cool thing to have a gay dad to get laid?  To women  I guess so  It works with the chicks  Just put out a special call here  Look, I love you, Mom  But Dad, if you wouldn't mind  Put in the effort  I could use help  Wow, that's some story  Yeah, I mean, it's cool though  Is your dad the woman in the relationship?  No  Who's Tom?  No, he's definitely not  Oh, no, he's getting to be a little bitchy lately, man  I don't know  Yeah, menopause  Dude, I gotta ask you this  It would be horrific enough to 
[02:39:30]  You know, especially if you're growing up  And you're living with your parents  Your mom and your dad  And you have to listen to them having sex  And hearing your mom moan and stuff  Do you ever hear your father and his boyfriend having sex?  You know what?  You know what?  Just since I've been living there  Like, we just moved out of a place  So my room's a little closer  And I think I heard something going on once  So I kind of got up and, like, stamped around my room  And threw on some, like, Pantera and cranked it up  Just saw  You know what I mean?  Oh, you just gotta think  The noise that you're hearing right now  There's your pops just

No, dude  You know  Fast wing cowboy, whatever  Can I have the car, Dad?  No  Faggot  Just immediately  End the conversation  We argue over clothes sometimes, man  I'll be like  My bad, my bad  That's all right  I see you look like S in that shirt, Dad  Give it to me, y'all  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot 
[02:40:30]  I can't believe I finally got through to you guys  That's insane  That'll do it  I knew if you had a fag dad  You know what?  He listened to that show where Mark plays a peach  Gay Marco, yeah  Yeah, I made him listen to it  He was dying  He almost pissed his pants  Yeah, but let me tell you something  If your dad was married for a while  And had you  I mean, he must have done that before  Eating a peach  No, I mean, you know 
[02:41:00]  He checks out chicks once in a while, dude  What did your mom say?  Was your mom on to this?  Dude, it's funny  They're like best friends now  But when my mom told my grandfather  He was like  Oh, you did it to him  Oh, you saw  My mom's like the biggest fag hag  It's so funny  She's got like three other gay boyfriends  Yeah, see?  Your father's father, that is?  The grandfather?  No, my mother's father  Oh  Yeah  My family's crazy, dude  Like  They all 
[02:41:30]  We have like one big party for family time  Like it's nuts, dude  It's so wacky  This guy's actually living dog day afternoon  You know how great that is?  Yeah  Oh, man  I'm dying, Leon  That's great  Nice  Here's the boyfriend  I'm big dick  I got on the radio  Talk to LNX  There you go, Todd  That's  Wow  I didn't think we were going to find anyone  With two dads  Two dads  Yeah  They've still wrong on the thing  Yeah  Two dads  There you have it  I didn't think we were going to talk to anyone today  Actually, my mom's husband and my dad's husband 
[02:42:00]  Both have the same name  Huh  Neil  Fag  Bye  I had to do it  The old Neil Bob joke  I had to do it  Yeah  Yeah  All right, man  All right, man  Thanks  See you, Pat  Peace  Daddy's a faggot  Seems pretty cool, though  He seems normal  Seems cool with it  I don't know how he treats the hookers that he strangles  He's thinking of his gay dad  If it's getting you late  If your dad's a team player, you can't knock it  How about that?  You take a chick home  You introduce her to your gay dad  Your gay dad's just like talking clothes and fashion 
[02:42:30]  And you're like totally cool with your gay dad  That does have to get some points with the chicks  Yep  So what if you're beating the locker room every day in school?  Timmy  Hey, what's going on?  Timmy  Live it live  Live it live  What's going on, guys?  I can tell you  I was adopted by two lesbians  Which are my  I actually called her my mother  Your mother  How long ago was this?  This was years ago  I'm 28 years old now  I'm there in the late 50s  No, but how old were you when they adopted you? 
[02:43:00]  Oh, I was adopted about four years old  Five years old  Yeah  Wow  You have any memory before you were adopted?  No, not really  Now that's hot  Two mommies  Come on  Yeah, they're pretty darn good, actually  Did you get to suckle off both of them?  No, no, no  It wasn't like that  I wish it was, though  Is one of your mommies hotter, do you think?  Do you, like, think that way?  If you're adopted at four  You really  Those are the only moms you know  Yeah, not really  That's like, you know, growing up  That was the only, you know  The only family I knew, you know 
[02:43:30]  Was there one mom that you preferred taking  To the parent-teacher conferences?  Actually, it was funny  Because when I would bring them both  You know, I'd bring them both to school  And they'd be like  Where's your father?  And, you know, it's hard to explain to them  You know, that  I have two mothers  And all the kids in school  Would break my chops and everything  Yeah, because you're talking about  Like, late 70s  Early 80s  When you were doing the schooling thing  I mean  They weren't as open-minded back then  Yeah, it was back in the 80s  I mean, you know  It was weird  I used to get tormented by kids and everything  I grew up with  You know, I grew up with  I grew up with  You know  How was it growing up 
[02:44:00]  With two periods to deal with?  Oh, man  You know, it was even funnier  You want to hear something funnier?  Yeah  When I started, you know  Driving and everything  I turned 17  I got my license  Then it was the little stints  Like, can you go to the store  And pick up pads or  Oh, my God  I mean, it drove me out of my freaking mind over here  That bathroom  The bathroom garbage pail  Yep  When they're both having it  It's got to look like the floor of an ER  After a gunshot  That's been brought in  That's so funny  So  I was just afraid  The day I turned 18  I was out of there 
[02:44:30]  Jesus, man  That's great  His bathroom looked like mash  I don't know  Tell me about it  Were they do some kissing and hugging and stuff  In front of you?

Yeah, it was a double don  I couldn't believe it  It was green  Did you ever hear him going at it?  No, I never heard him going at it  No  Now, let me ask you  When you watch porn  Do the lesbians turn you on? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah  I just think mommy  I like lesbians  There's nothing wrong with them  Alright  Are they uptight about being gay  Or do you think they'll be going to Rascals on Thursday  To see me, Rich Force  And Otto and George  Or if they're more reserved  They can go to government  Thursday through Sunday  They love it  They're musically oriented  They can come down to Bar 9 tonight  To see me  Joe, I'll actually play music of Lilith Bear  I'm funny  Hear that rug  It's ironic  We're talking about two lesbians  We're doing plugs  Yeah  Quite a strange life
