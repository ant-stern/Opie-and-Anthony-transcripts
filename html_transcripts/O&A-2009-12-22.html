<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about three elderly women protesting the removal of a crabapple tree in Shrewsbury to make way for a dumpster.  The hosts attempted a prank call to one of the women, Ethel, but she was unavailable.  They then played a news report about the protest, noting the reporter's amusement.  A subsequent phone interview with Ethel revealed the women’s actions, their meetings with management, and the significant media attention they received.  Ethel, a witty woman who immigrated from England after WWII, humorously answered the hosts' playful and absurd questions about her age, background, and abilities.  A caller, Steve, briefly spoke with Ethel before Anthony left the show early.  The hosts then commented on Ethel's personality before transitioning to an in-studio interview with Philippe Petit, the famous high-wire walker.  Petit recounted his meticulous preparation for his walk between the Twin Towers, discussing his philosophy and lack of fear.  The segment concluded with a brief mention of a news story about a woman with multiple sclerosis who died in a house fire after a significant delay with 911.

The show continued with a sexually explicit segment featuring E-Rock, Sam Roberts, Nick DiPaolo, and "Stalker Patty," a virgin in her 50s who claimed to have stalked Opie.  The segment centered on crude jokes and attempts to initiate Patty into sexual activity, including dry humping, touching, and conversations about her anxieties and desires.  The hosts and DiPaolo made sexually degrading remarks and pressured Patty into sexual acts, which she largely resisted.  A strap-on dildo and a fake vagina were used in a sexually explicit bit involving Jimmy. The segment was filled with vulgar language and graphic descriptions.

A later segment involved a sexually suggestive phone call with a woman named Patty, including explicit descriptions of simulated sexual acts with a sex toy.  The conversation shifted to Patty's financial struggles, leading to a collection of money for her in the studio.  Patty then performed a striptease on air for money.  Following the striptease, Daniel Maurer, author of "Brocabulary," was interviewed, discussing sexually explicit slang terms from his book.  The hosts then showed Patty a video of "Two Girls, One Cup," offering her large sums of money to recreate it, which she declined.

A subsequent segment featured another interview with Daniel Maurer, focusing on sexually explicit terms from "Brocabulary," including "slam decapped," "transvest tanked," "master date," and many others (a full list is provided in the original summary).  A caller, Steve, expressed interest in the book, but his call was interrupted by the hosts' increasingly hostile and offensive remarks.  Emily De Raven, an actress from *Lost*, then joined the show.  The conversation shifted to *Lost*, including plot points, character deaths, and fan speculation.  The hosts discussed inaccuracies on Wikipedia regarding De Raven’s marital status and her roles in other films, including a question about a rape scene in *The Hills Have Eyes*.

A further segment featured another conversation with Emily De Raven, discussing *Lost*,  character relationships (Charlie and Locke), and her experiences on set.  The hosts repeatedly encouraged her profanity.  A call-in segment followed, with listeners making comments related to *Lost*.  The hosts discussed Emily's arm hair and the show's plot complexities.  They jokingly promoted her movie, *Balls Don't Lie*.  The segment concluded with an extended, sexually explicit bit involving the intern, David, who was challenged to perform increasingly outrageous acts involving Danny, including kissing his ass cheek, for money. Sam also participated in kissing Danny's ass cheek.  David apologized for running the show over schedule.  Bruce Campbell was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

The show ended with a "Guess the Sound" bit, where the sound (implied to be a child screaming) was initially obscured.  The hosts made crude jokes.  A caller, Steve, correctly guessed the sound, spoiling the bit which involved morbidly humorous answers related to a miscarriage.  The hosts expressed their annoyance and acknowledged the segment's tasteless nature, promoting their "worst of 2009" compilation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You're listening to the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We could talk to the crab apple brought today.  Do you want to do it or what?  More than I want to breathe.  Is it going to be the one, though, Stunt Brain?  How do we get her to say can't?  We really got to think of that.  Okay, so they could or...  So could they transplant the tree?  That's the goal.  Maybe a little...  So you're saying they can't?  Can you do this?  No, I can't.  Yeah, we need her to say that. 
[00:00:30]  We'll get her.  We'll get her.  Oh, we'll get her, all right.  Well, the story, got to thank Mike, the board op up there in Boston at BCN.  He found this gem, a great story in Shrewsbury.  Three old broads, an apartment complex, a crab apple tree,  and they're guarding the crab apple tree  because they don't want them to cut the crab apple tree down to put a dumpster in its place  because I guess the apartment complex needs a dumpster and they got to put it somewhere. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And it's this lame-ass tree all by itself in this apartment complex.  Lame.  And they're using, like, lawn furniture and a tiny little, like, twine to tie themselves together.  But then yesterday we called this Ethel, and she was sleeping.  Ethel.  She wasn't guarding the crab apple.  No.  And here's our best clip from the story.  There was a bunch of them, but this one is our best for obvious reasons, 
[00:01:30]  as they explain their plight up there in Shrewsbury.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies,  they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree.  And I can't see why they can't fix the dumpster, why they can't fix the pad.  I mean, I'd like to know them to tell me why they can't fix the pad.  All it is is a cement pad.  I'm sure if I was young I could fix it.  Yeah.  Just amazing.  Now, what's in that clip that we haven't really acknowledged?  It's some guy kind of laughing. 
[00:02:00]  Is that the reporter realizing what's going down?  I don't know.  Yeah, someone chuckled in there.  Yeah.  Well, we're getting Ethel on the phone right now to see how the crab apple tree thing is going.  Travis is dialing the number.  Oh.  It's ringing.  We're waiting.  All right.  I think we got her.  All right.  Be nice.  Yeah, no, I think it's good that they did that.  I mean, sometimes you've got to, if you have an issue with something,  you have to take the fight to City Hall, as they say. 
[00:02:30]  Jimmy, sometimes you've got to make a stand for what you believe in,  and nothing but the utmost respect for these three ladies making a stand for something they believe in.  It's wonderful, I believe.  More people should do it.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Ethel.  Yes?  Welcome to the radio show.  How are you?  Ethel.  Oh, I'm fine today.  Thank you.  Oh, very good.  Very good.  Now, Ethel, we've been watching your plight here,  your battle to save a crab apple tree in your apartment complex.  Right.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:03:00]  Could you take us through, you know,  the whole story for the people that might be hearing it for the first time?  Yes.  How did it start?  Oh, well, it started that we were told that, you know,  the apple tree was coming down to move a dumpster,  which the cement block had, you know, deteriorated.  Oh, goodness.  And it needed to be fixed.  Yes.  Well, they're having a dedication for a Mr. Ricker up here.  So I guess they wanted to rush it through,  and they thought we probably wouldn't even notice.  Oh, but you girls are sharp. 
[00:03:30]  I know.  You noticed.  The trucks came up, and we were out there in a flash,  and we just sat there, and the trucks left,  and we just continued to sit there.  But then we had a meeting last night.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  How'd that go?  Yesterday lunchtime, rather.  It went very well, and I think they realize now that, you know,  it's something they shouldn't have done.  So can they still cut this tree down?  No.  Well, they have promised not to do anything, 
[00:04:00]  and they're having another meeting on October 14th,  and they are going to see, you know, if they can find an alternative.  But why can't they just do something else?  Well, I don't see why they can't just fix the platform.  I mean, they can build nuclear bombs.  They can go to the moon.  So, I mean, just to fix it.  Well, they claim there are wires underneath which there are,  but they've been there for 37 years.  Oh, wow.  And I think that as long as they have the electric light company there, 
[00:04:30]  which they probably will, you know, to check it, it will be all right.  Now, you've gotten a lot of media attention on this, Ethel.  Yes, we did.  We were very lucky.  And I believe that is helping your cause.  So is the tree now safe?  Yes, yes, until October 14th at least.  Oh, goodness.  Yes, and probably even beyond that.  Can't you fix the slab or no?  Oh, I think it could be slipped.  There's kind of a slope there. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, and I imagine when the men come to pick up the dumpster thing that, you know,  they're not too careful, I don't imagine.  I don't know.  But, you know, the front of it has deteriorated over the years.  And one woman fell and broke her arm.  Oh, my goodness.  I hope she's okay.  Oh, yes, she's fine.  Oh, good, good.  Can the tree be moved and saved?  No, the tree couldn't be moved.  No.  No. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, I don't think it would even be worth it.  But it's a pretty spot.  That's what it is.  It's a very pretty spot.  Yeah, well, we saw it on TV and saw you ladies.  Do you spend a lot of time underneath the tree?  Yeah, well, we don't.  But we do have, like, a good view of it because otherwise we're just looking at a parking lot,  you know?  So that is a good spot.  Yes.  Yeah.  Ethel, can you believe all the attention that you're getting?  No, I can't.  Only in America.  Only in America, right? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely right.  I mean, can you imagine another scenario that would have given you guys this type of attention?  Oh, no, I can't imagine.  It was amazing.  We saw the footage of you, the three of you kind of, like, tying yourselves up to the tree,  just kind of challenging them to move you.  Yeah.  That's great.  Very brave, Ethel.  Can you think – I'm sorry, Ethel.  Can you think of another example of something that you've done like this?  No, not really. 
[00:06:30]  But we've been down several times when different things come up, you know, to talk to the board.  Uh-huh.  But we didn't get too far with those things.  But, like, when – we used to have umbrellas – well, there's two floors.  And upstairs, they needed umbrellas, sun umbrellas, because in the summer, it gets very hot.  I bet.  Of course it does, Ethel.  Of course it does.  Yeah.  Oh, they're very, very pretty.  And I used to look down there and I think, oh, that is so pretty.  It looks so nice.  And maybe plants hanging from the railing. 
[00:07:00]  And we used to have chairs on the porch and things.  Yeah.  Now we're allowed a chair on the porch, but we have to take it in each night.  Well, can you plant other trees there?  No.  Well, they claim they could plant another apple tree where the dumpster was.  But if they can dig it to put an apple tree, they can dig it to fix it.  Right, right.  So that's the way I think.  I don't know.  So they were saying that they can move the dumpster back where the old slab was? 
[00:07:30]  Yes, it's still on the old slab, but all it needs to be done is, I don't know, I think  they could fix it.  Ethel, can you spell superfragilisticexpialidocious?  Can you spell that?  Not right now, thank you.  Ethel.  It's not early.  Ethel, obviously I'm hearing a bit of an accent.  Where are you from originally?  I was born in England, and during the end of the war, 1947, I came over and married my 
[00:08:00]  husband.  Oh.  We were married for 54 years.  Oh, God bless.  That's wonderful.  Now, Ethel, it's true it's a crabapple tree, right?  Yes.  Well, Cliff in New York wants to know, can you use the crabapples to make something delicious?  No, I imagine, I think a tree should be fed, or, you know, it probably needs attention  to be able to use that. 
[00:08:30]  Do you think you guys can give it the attention it needs?  Well, we can try.  We can try.  Either that, or just have the apples drop on our heads.  Goodness gracious, Ethel.  But I gotta be honest, we were really shocked.  We love the kind of, the way you three weren't backing down.  Yeah, sure.  Can you think of a way that you could have gotten more attention from this?  No, I don't.  I really don't.  This was the best attention we could have gotten.  Yeah.  It helps your cause, right?  All that focus, now all these people are interested. 
[00:09:00]  It kind of helps you guys keep the tree going.  Yes, and we've had quite a few comments, you know, even on, you know, on the computer  and so forth.  Oh, I'm sure.  You use the computer?  Yes.  Really?  Ethel, Brooklyn Ace wants to know if you could see the tree from your window.  Not from the window, from the porch, I can.  Oh, but not from the window.  Oh, okay.  Now, the other two can.  Oh, your friends, they can. 
[00:09:30]  And you can too?  Yes.  Oh, they can and you can.  No, I can.  I can, I can see it from the porch.  I can see it from here.  Right.  In fact, my son came down to look at it yesterday and he wanted to, because he couldn't really  remember, you know, what it looked like.  And he said, it's a very pretty spot.  He said, it would be an eyesore to put a dumpster there.  Oh, it certainly would.  Hey, Steve from California wants to know, how old of a woman are you there, Ethel?  Well, I know it's not polite, but.  It's not polite.  I know it.  Well, I am 85. 
[00:10:00]  85.  God bless you, Ethel.  And from now on, I'm changing my age.  I'm going down to 79.  Oh, I like that.  You are quite a card, Ethel.  Hey, Ethel, as a 79-year-old battle axe, do you think you could climb the crab apple tree?  No, I don't think so.  No, I don't want to take that down.  No, absolutely not.  No.  Can you smell, because I know that one of the concerns you had was that this nice air you  had to enjoy.  Mm-hmm.  Can you smell the dumpster from where you are? 
[00:10:30]  No, I can't, because I'm like four houses down, but the others would, because on that  side, the wind seems to blow from that direction.  And don't ask me which is north, south, east, or west, because I never can tell.  I can't either.  I just rely on something.  Tell me.  So you can tell direction good?  No, I can't tell direction good.  You tell me three times, and I'm lost.  Oh, I gotcha.  How often do you go back to England? 
[00:11:00]  Well, when my husband was alive, we went quite a few times.  My two sons went, and they've been there, and now my grandsons have been there, and they  love it, and my granddaughter.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I'm sorry to hear about your loss after so many years.  I'm very sorry.  Yeah, that sucks.  Yeah, thank you.  That really sucks, man.  Yes, absolutely.  You sound like a wonderful woman.  Absolutely.  A lot of fun, a lot of energy.  That's nice that you and your friends have taken on this cause.  Right. 
[00:11:30]  Any other causes in the future, perhaps?  Well, if they come up, we'll be ready.  Of course.  Josh in Boston Proper wants to know if you can at least reach up and pick the crab apples.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, we could.  Oh, that's nice.  I could.  I'm not very tall, though, but I could.  I don't know.  What are crab apples good for?  I don't know.  I think...  I don't know.  Maybe they make some kind of jelly, but I think they do put it in some kind of jelly. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah?  Can you make a pie out of them?  Oh, I don't.  I mean, you personally.  No, not me.  I don't like cooking.  Oh, you don't, huh?  No.  Can you bake?  Oh, yeah, I have baked, but I mean, as you get older, you're just cooking for yourself.  Sure.  You don't try to go out and eat.  Can you run?  No, I can't run, I don't think.  I haven't tried.  I don't have to run for anyone.  Yeah, what does she have to run for, Opie?  Maybe she can sit on the patio or under the tree. 
[00:12:30]  I understand, but some of the older women out there, they're keeping themselves in shape  and stuff, so...  I saw her.  Yeah, I think people...  Yeah.  I think it's because of the TV.  Yeah, of course.  Yes, they know what it means to keep in shape, and they're much better off.  Ethel, can you rock climb?  Can I rock climb?  No, we did climb a mountain in...  Can you bike?  ...a few years ago.  Oh, you did?  Yes. 
[00:13:00]  Can you bike?  Oh, I used to bike, yes, but that's all we had in England.  Can you water ski?  Water ski?  No, I do not like water.  Oh, you don't like the water.  No, I'm scared of the water.  Well, that's probably why you moved off of the island over there, you know?  Oh, good gosh.  Can you rollerblade?  No, no.  Do you have vivid recollection of the war there, Ethel?  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, what was that like in England?  I like talking to people from England during the wartime. 
[00:13:30]  What was that like for a young woman back there in the 40s during the war?  Well, it was very, well, we used to, like, at night, we'd go to the, we called it the pictures, the movies.  Right.  And then my mother and father were home, and my little niece was with them.  But as soon as the siren sounded, we ran, we ran all the way home, because we figured if one's going, we're all going.  Yeah.  And the air raids, we've had, we had bombs on the street. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  One night, well, we used to go down at a little shelter in the backyard.  It was like a little concert hut.  Oh, my goodness.  And they dug down a big hole, and then they dropped it in.  But, of course, we were all there one night, because there was a big, big air raid going on.  Wow.  So, yeah, well, I remember all of it.  Wow, that is something.  That sure is.  So many stories, I bet.  I had five brothers and one sister in the service. 
[00:14:30]  Really?  Yeah, my one brother died in Tunisia.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Oh, we're really sorry to hear that.  You know what?  Heroes.  You could be very proud.  Yes.  Yes.  I think I could write a book.  You probably could.  Are you going to write one?  No, I don't think so, no.  I just took up painting with several of the ladies here, and I enjoy that.  Can you paint the Mona Lisa yet?  No, not yet, but just watch for the, just watch. 
[00:15:00]  Hey, are you able to speak German?  No, no, no.  No, but we did have Italian prisoners of war working on the land right near where I was.  Oh, really?  Yeah, after we moved from London, we moved up to the East Coast, and there was all these,  but my mother used to make them cocoa and everything.  They were just ordinary people.  Oh, wow.  Just like everybody else.  So now I hear the Americans, you know, when they were over there. 
[00:15:30]  Now, I'm not getting into any personal matters or anything, but any of the American men take a fancy to you, Ethel?  Yeah, just this one.  Your husband?  Yes.  Was he an American?  Yes, yes.  What did they used to say?  The worst thing about the Americans is they're overpaid.  Oh, that was the thing.  If they, you know, when they went to a, you know, to the pub or anything, I mean, they, you know, and I think that's the way they are.  They're just generous, but they used to have their money out on the table, and, of course, the English didn't have such good uniforms either, you know. 
[00:16:00]  Kind of scratchy uniforms, but no, but no, but no, my mother liked him.  My mother really liked him.  It was something like they were overpaid, oversexed, and over here.  That was the problem.  Yeah.  Oh, goodness gracious, Ethel.  All right, let's say hi to Steve from...  Oh, no, let's not.  Steve.  Steve, where are you calling from?  Hello, I'm in the house. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, hi.  Hi, Steve.  I think I have to leave early.  No, no.  This is terrible.  Ethel.  Hi, Ethel.  How are you?  This is Anthony, and I have to leave a little early.  All right.  But it's been wonderful talking to you.  Thank you.  And now you can talk with Steve, because I want nothing to do with Steve.  Hi, Ethel.  How are you?  Okay.  I can't really hear.  There's a noise going on.  I don't know what it is.  I'm calling.  I'm one of the callers for the radio show.  How are you?  Wait, you can hear him okay, Ethel? 
[00:17:00]  I can just about hear him, yes.  Oh.  Ethel, can you actually fix the slab yourself?  Can I what?  Can you fix the slab yourself?  I think when I was younger, I might have done it.  Because I had a very similar thing.  We used to have a crab apple tree where I grew up.  Oh, did they?  Yes, I was constantly engaging in certain experiences behind it with other friends.  Yes.  Well, I don't know how long this one will last,  but for however long it lasts, I think it's still going to be there. 
[00:17:30]  Well, do you think they're actually going to move the dumpster there?  Because that's where most of my production belongs.  Oh, you know what?  Oh, no, I was wondering if they're going to move the dumpster there.  No, no, I don't want the dumpster there.  I'm sorry?  I don't want the dumpster there.  Yes, I love the fact that you took a stand because so many people won't take a stand.  They just allow everybody to walk on them.  That's right.  But when it happens, when it goes through, when it's all safe, then they're all right. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really admire the fact that you have so much energy, too,  because my grandmother always was like that, too.  She had a tremendous amount of energy,  and she would always scold me for being in the closet with other boys and such,  and I love the fact that that energy keeps you going.  I'm right.  Of course.  Do you have any other causes that you're going to be fighting for?  No, I don't.  If we say, come up, we'll be here as long as we can. 
[00:18:30]  That's fantastic.  I can't do it.  Have you thought maybe you could name the crab apple tree?  Damn it, you got to.  No.  No, that's silly.  No.  Raboon.  No.  This lady's very nice.  Yes, Ethel is a wonderful, wonderful woman.  Ramone.  I enjoy eating crab apples.  They're delicious.  Aw.  Oh, well, I've never tried one.  Oh, Ramone.  I was only kidding.  You probably don't want to bake them into a pie, do you? 
[00:19:00]  No, I don't think so, no.  No.  No, no.  No.  Okay, well, I have to go now because even I have certain standards.  Yes, I'm sure you do.  I don't have work ethics.  Yes.  I don't have very good production.  I'm actually looking at the man I'm doing an impression of right now.  So it's like, Ramone.  She's a wonderful woman.  God love her.  Yes.  Wow.  Well, thank you, Steve.  And Ethel.  Ethel.  Well, let's talk to Ethel a little. 
[00:19:30]  Steve, all right.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Ethel, wow.  You're a media star now.  Yeah, you sure are.  I've got to tell my kids that.  Are you planning on doing any more television?  No, I don't think so.  No, I didn't like myself on television.  Oh, why not?  Why not, Ethel?  I thought you were charming.  Absolutely.  I think what it is, you don't really see yourself.  You know, I mean, you look in the mirror, but you don't really see yourself. 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  But I didn't like it.  Can you get out to Hollywood?  Oh, well, maybe someday.  Oh, maybe someday.  You can lead a horse to water, but...  But you can't make it drink.  What was that?  Excuse me?  But you can't make it drink.  Exactly.  Right.  Wow.  I've got to get one more.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Uncle Paul up there in Worcester, Massachusetts, wants to say something to Ethel.  Oh, all right. 
[00:20:30]  Hi, Ethel.  God love you.  Oh, thank you.  I love the energy.  Like the last caller said, I'm 57 years young.  So how old are your grandchildren?  Oh, your grandchildren.  Yes.  How old are your grandchildren?  Yes.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  How old are they?  What is he, a comedian?  No, no, no.  You have grandchildren.  How old are your grandchildren?  Oh.  How old?  Oh, my son. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, I hate to say how old.  No, your grandchildren.  I think he's 58, 59.  I don't remember.  How old are your grandkids?  Oh, no, my grandchildren, they're, um, one's still in college, and one is a teacher, and  the other one manages a store in, you know, Boston.  Ah, boy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, jeez, it looks like we've lost Uncle Paul.  Looks like we lost Uncle Paul somehow.  Maybe the phone line. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  He's talking now, Ethel.  Can you hear him?  No, I can't.  No.  Thanks.  What's he ringing the bell for?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm trying to get the guy's attention to fix the phone line.  That's right.  All right.  They said they fixed it.  Can you hear him now?  No.  No.  No.  Damn.  You'll do it for him, but not me.  I'll tell you, Ethel, you are a sharpie.  Thank you.  I like you.  You're very sharp-witted and just a wonderful woman, and best of luck in any future endeavors 
[00:22:00]  that you may have in saving this tree.  I think it was a very noble cause of you and your friends.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Keep fighting the good fight, and maybe we'll talk to you after it's finally resolved.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  You sound like you have a good time.  Oh, we have a lot of fun here, Ethel.  We try.  Do you think you could do your own radio show?  No, I don't think so, no.  No, I'm too busy.  Oh, really?  Wait, what do you do?  What do you do to keep busy?  Well, I do a lot of things.  We go out a lot. 
[00:22:30]  We go out to eat.  Like I said, we go painting, and we go looking in antique stores.  Can you drive, Ethel?  Oh, of course I can drive.  Oh, very good.  You don't get a flashback and drive on the wrong side of the road, do you?  Oh, no.  That did happen when we went back one time.  Oh, good gravy.  Yes.  And then we came home, and then my husband came out, and he wasn't used to driving on the  other side.  Oh.  And all of a sudden, he realized he was on the wrong side. 
[00:23:00]  It is.  In fact, when you're in the car, though, over there, and I used to look, and I'd see people  looking out of the window, and I'd say, well, he's not even looking where he's going, and  I realized it was a passenger.  That's the passenger.  Oh, my God.  Can you drive from the left side over there?  No, I never drove over there.  No, all I had was a bicycle.  Oh, a bicycle.  Yeah.  Oh, that's quaint.  And take the trains and the buses, whatever. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  It wasn't hard.  Oh, boy, we sure showed those Nazis, didn't we?  I guess we did.  Yes, we did.  He laughs.  I hear you, Ethel.  I know where you're coming from.  That's right.  All right, sweetheart.  You have fun, and tell your friends hello for us.  I will.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Bye, Ethel.  Thank you, Ethel.  There she goes, Ethel.  What a sweet old bag.  She was very nice.  She was too nice.  And, boy, did we get a few C words out of her. 
[00:24:00]  It was a good game.  She wasn't that easy.  That's why it was fun to do.  She wasn't easy to stump.  Came up with a lot of different words for Ken all of a sudden.  Damn it.  We need her the most.  Holy meckle.  Meckle.  Good job, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  She's just too sweet an old lady.  I'm not Ramoni her.  From England. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, just Mary Poppins-ish.  Yeah.  It was funny, though.  Made it through the war.  Her husband forever is dead and everything.  The call came through.  You were trying to bail out.  Oh, I know.  Just like, I'm not even going to sit here.  Yeah, I was getting death threats on Paltog and stuff.  Be nice, Tar.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Yeah, Ethel's all right in our book.  It's the worst.  Of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  And now we say good morning to Philippe Petit on our couch.  I can't believe you're actually sitting here. 
[00:25:00]  We're huge fans of yours, sir.  We've been talking about you.  Just pull the mic a little closer.  We've been talking about you for a long time.  Even before the documentary, we were always talking about you.  Chris, there's another guy, Alain Robert, who you probably know.  He climbs buildings.  No, I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a assistant.  He doesn't use a wire.  He just climbs the buildings, which is pretty easy.  I think he knows them, but he doesn't want to acknowledge them.  Yeah.  Which is cool.  I like that.  Yeah, glorified window washer.  I think what you did was harder.  Everybody knows you.  You walked on a tightrope in between the Twin Towers. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I don't try to do things that are harder, harder.  I'm interested in beautiful theater in the sky.  All right.  I've never heard it put that way before.  Yeah, that is that.  Well, the book I have, my ex-girlfriend, who did eventually leave me, got me your book for Christmas last year,  because I've been kind of obsessed with you for a long time.  She's got good taste.  Yeah, she really does.  She left me for a gentleman of color. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  In books, I meant.  And it's just this...  Still a fan, Jimmy?  Yeah, of course I am.  Yeah.  And I knew he'd be an interesting interview, because you do have a very poetic, odd way of  looking at the world.  You're not a typical guy.  I couldn't be.  Not to do that, I suppose not.  Was there ever a moment, because my greatest fear is heights, and Nick was talking about  the terror of heights.  Were you in the middle of walking across in between these buildings, and you just thought, 
[00:26:30]  what am I doing here?  No, no.  I had been thinking of being between those towers for many, many years, even before they  were built.  So when I found myself there, it was by choice, not by chance.  And I loved it.  You had no fear of falling?  I mean, even as a guy who knows...  It's very logic, my answer, and it's not a pun.  It's reality.  I had no fear of falling, because I could not fall.  If not, I would be fearful, of course, and I would run away in fear.  But because I cannot fall, because I put myself in a state of psychological and tangible 
[00:27:00]  certitude, solidity, I can enter in this fragile world with knowing I will do the final  step victoriously.  So what are you thinking as you're walking across?  I mean, there's one part where I think you said you focused on the other building, on  a piece of metal.  Is that what you actually looked at?  Yeah, yeah.  One nice way, when you're on a tightrope, try it one day, and believe me, it's the right  way.  Look at where the wire is tied on the other side. 
[00:27:30]  It's a bit like the horizon on a long walk, and that makes you feel like you're part of  a rigid system.  But in these walks, as you know, I walk many times, eight times.  My friends told me I didn't have a machine to measure my walks, but I stayed there like  almost 45 minutes, and during that time, I actually looked down, looked around.  You sat down on the wire.  Yes, I sat down.  You laid down on the wire.  And how high up were the Twin Towers, like a quarter mile?  Just a quarter of a mile. 
[00:28:00]  Something like that?  Yeah, yeah.  A quarter mile in the air.  That would knock the wind out of you.  Yeah, no kidding.  One of the highest towers in the world at the time.  Sure.  This photo here, this is to me, I mean, they're all horrifying photos, but this one I'll show  Nick, is Philippe, he's in between the towers, and he is, you could be lounging on a hammock  somewhere.  So let me correct you, there's nothing horrifying about this picture.  It's glorifying about the Twin Towers, and it's magnificent about seeing a man becoming  half a bird.  It's glorifying to you, horrifying for every single human being out there. 
[00:28:30]  Philippe, how do you explain that you don't have an affair of heights, but somebody like  me or Jimmy, is that genetics?  No, no, no, I was not born as a wire worker.  I actually fought for it because I was not born in the circus world, and my parents and  the teachers and the whole powers that be around me as a teenager said, no, no, no.  And my intuition was, yes, yes, yes.  So I became a natural climber at six years old, I climbed everywhere, played with ropes 
[00:29:00]  like little kids do, and I found myself at 16, 17, learning by myself, which is very unusual,  the art of wire walking.  So I have no fear because I loved it all along.  You see, if I force you to get on a wire, you're going to resist and say, oh, I'm scared.  But if you leave from your childhood climbing everywhere, it's very natural that you're going  to become a wire walker.  Carl Walenda fell to his death.  I mean, obviously, a very accomplished guy on the wire.  Was that after, I think, you did this, or was that before you did that, when he fell? 
[00:29:30]  After.  It was after.  Okay, so you didn't have that.  Would seeing that have kind of slowed you down at all, or it wouldn't have stopped you?  No, but it's always a good lesson.  I was actually invited to perform where he did, and I went to Puerto Rico, and I studied  the wind, and I say, I'm not interested in his assignment.  What was the mistake he made that day?  Just not reading the conditions?  I refuse to talk about how people could have felt if they're not in front of me, to refute  me.  But as a wire walker, I know that I will never do a walk when I await all the odds. 
[00:30:00]  And, for example, if I propose a place to walk where it's very windy, I will study the  wind, and I might say no, which I said in this specific...  Well, all right, going with that, so the day you decided to walk between the Twin Towers,  if it was windy up there, you weren't going to go?  No, it was windy, and by nature, there was turbulence there, which is like mad wind that  you cannot control.  And I knew that from my homework, and for dozens and hundreds of visits, sneaking up  while the towers were being built, or finished almost. 
[00:30:30]  So, I don't know.  I don't believe in gods, but I think the gods believe in me.  Sure.  So, you visited the towers dozens of times before this?  No, hundreds of times.  Hundreds of times.  Yeah.  I was in New York eight months street juggling to survive, passing my hat.  So, you were street juggling, and then you were sneaking into the towers when you could.  Well, I had to disguise myself as an architect, or a worker, or a journalist.  A reporter, journalist?  A reporter, yeah.  And then I sneak in a building thousands of times, have friends taking pictures, measuring  things, daydreaming. 
[00:31:00]  It's important to daydream when you're building a dream.  You're meticulous, because that's what I took away from the documentary.  This wasn't like a whim.  You really studied the towers, and you really prepared.  You went back to your hometown, and even when you were practicing the conditions that  you thought would be happening that day, you even had your friends shaking the wire to  try to knock you down.  Absolutely, and we have a wonderful, true footage of that that was shot at the time.  So, this film is marvelous, because it's a modern tailing, and at the same time, going  back 34 years, and showing amazing footage that survived, you know, all those dozens 
[00:31:30]  of years.  Now, there's video of you doing some other tightrope walks.  Why didn't you get the Twin Towers thing filmed?  Why didn't you have a buddy up there?  I wanted to.  I had.  I had my friend who shot the arrow with the bow.  He was a photographer, so we took pictures.  But we had rented a 16-millimeter camera, and I said, take a few pictures, but run to  the camera and press the red button.  I want a live footage.  And he was about to do that when the police came to his roof, so he has to hide. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, no.  And he went down, and his pictures ended up all over the world in the front page, but  no film, which at the time, I was really, really upset.  And now I think it adds to the legend.  Mystico.  Yeah.  I mean, the towers are even no longer there.  It looks like, did I dream all this?  Am I inventing all this?  I'm sure you've given that guy a scolding over the years, though.  Why are you hiding?  You should have got arrested for me, so we have some video of this.  No, no, but then the pictures have been confiscated, and you know, the wall.  Oh, so they would have taken, right, right, right, right. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, it was a caper story.  Now, Jimmy, you got it.  So you actually looked down at one point, and there was a photo of you, I guess, balancing  yourself, where you kind of go down onto the wire, and your leg is hanging down, and you  said you took a look down because you'd never see that view again.  Yes, I do that, actually, not in the middle of a performance, but sometimes, yes, I stop  performing, and I do a little thing for my own pleasure, and it is often to sit on the  wire, let's say on a very long and high wire, and then to look around and look down. 
[00:33:00]  And it's amazing because it's a view that, it is true, I will never, never have again.  Each walk is very different, and at the top of the world, you know, 1,350 feet in the  air.  Right.  I had to look around, and I recorded magnificent images.  Yeah, nobody, nobody will have that view.  You're the only one.  No, nobody did, and nobody will.  Nobody will.  Now, we were talking about this whole thing earlier this morning.  We really thought it was like a wire in a bag, you throw the wire to the other side,  no big deal.  I learned through the documentary, there's something like a half ton of equipment. 
[00:33:30]  No, no, almost a ton.  Almost a ton of equipment.  You had to sneak into the Twin Towers.  Yeah, divided in two crews, the North crew with the little equipment, the bow and arrow,  and the South crew, me and a friend.  A few accomplices, I fired a few hours before to sneak in the building because they were incapable.  So, we were not enough people on my tower, and we had almost a ton of equipment.  Right.  And you had to sneak in through the freight elevators and this and that, and you had fake badges.  You've got to be a good criminal, too.  Well, I am, I am. 
[00:34:00]  I was born a criminal.  I mean, an artistic criminal.  So, you know, I can go to school and talk to students and tell them, you know, go on  and pursue your dreams.  There's nothing illegal about that, although maybe there is these days.  And the biggest thing, you had to figure out how to get the wire from one building to  the other, and you finally decided on the arrow.  No, I didn't decide.  It was my friend.  Your friend came on.  I decided, and I thought it was a ridiculous idea.  Don't bother me with a bow.  Well, how were you going to do it if you didn't have your practice?  Wait, wait, wait.  Before you say that, how did you think you were going to get the wire across?  Oh, I had to throw it.  This is ridiculous.  It's in my book. 
[00:34:30]  I share with the reader all the ways.  One of the ways was I was thinking of a little radio-guided helicopter with a fishing line.  But those things, first, you need three years to master them, okay?  I went to a specialized shop, and the guy says, forget it.  Plus, he made a demo for me, and it makes so much ruckus.  The whole lower Manhattan would have woken up, you know?  So, but the bow and arrow was beautiful, and it worked.  Except I was thinking, what if the arrow pierced my heart?  And in the morning, the cops are really puzzled.  They see a dead French man with an arrow in his heart, and they say, you know, what's going on? 
[00:35:00]  But it didn't happen.  Yeah, and then you decide on the arrow with the fishing line.  And then in the middle of the night, you finally, well, your buddy, right, he shot the arrow across?  Yeah, on the ghost tower, he shot the cross, and then we pulled out.  Well, well, you're skipping a step, and I have to give this away because I found it a little strange.  It's very dangerous for me to skip steps.  I understand, but you couldn't, you didn't, you weren't sure if the arrow made it to your side with the fishing line.  So, very strange, you decide you needed to get completely naked to. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, but you're telling about the film.  A little bit.  That's not going to give everything away.  Yeah, it is true because, you know, imagine this is a comic movie in itself.  You're in the middle of the night, totally dark, and you're looking for an invisible nylon fishing line.  I mean, so I thought after a few attempts, I thought he missed.  Maybe the arrow is in New Jersey, you know.  So, yeah, I took my clothes off, and I look, and then I could feel on my legs a little caress of a fishing line.  It was the most beautiful caress I ever had on those legs for years. 
[00:36:00]  No, it's not true.  Well, then, then you, I don't, then you attach something else to the fishing line, and you slowly get up to.  Yeah, a heavy cord and a new rope, and then when it was strong enough, that rope, a thick rope, could actually pull a very heavy steel cable across,  and we are all kind of troubled, and the police came.  And, but anyway, read the book and see the film.  Yeah, we will.  Yeah, this is not, nothing you say is going to cause people to not want to see this film because, I mean, first of all, everybody knows you live.  So it's not like, well, does he die at the end? 
[00:36:30]  So it's how did he do it?  It's not like the Bible.  Hold on, hold on.  What is fabulous about this film is that there is a suspense, and even I, I'm supposed to be the guy I'm supposed to know I made it.  Well, I am on the edge of my seat when I'm in a dark theater full of people, I am laughing and crying and applauding with them, and I want to know the outcome.  Is he going to make it?  So it's a good film.  It's a great film, actually.  You're so animated, and you really make it by how you're describing everything.  I was also interested in all the people around you that are interviewed in this and all the people that helped you with this that are in this film that talk about what they were feeling and how they didn't think you. 
[00:37:00]  It's a very interesting group of people that all talk about what went into making this happen because everybody just obviously thinks of you instead of realizing that there were friends and then there was a girlfriend and there was all this stuff that went on behind the scenes.  The girlfriend and all this stuff, yes.  Why did he get naked again?  I don't understand.  Just to feel the fishing line.  A little strange, yes.  I'm with you on that, Nick.  Yeah, yeah.  How about a flashlight there? 
[00:37:30]  You sort of glossed over that.  How about a flashlight?  Look around a little bit.  What is that on my boss?  Are you going to do any more walking to that extent?  I know you're still performing all that, but are you thinking of another?  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Obviously nothing as huge as the Twin Towers.  Well, I have small, medium, and giant walks.  I'm not trying to collect the gigantic, but it looks, when I look back at my life, I have done big things.  But I have many projects.  One of them is quite mysterious. 
[00:38:00]  It's to attach my rope or my wire to the belly of those big statues in Easter Island.  The Moai, they are sacred statues.  And I will be like a very mysterious out-of-the-world walk.  So things like that interest me, and they almost look like they have their room in a movie rather than in real life.  But I continue to perform.  I continue to write books.  I'm writing my seventh book right now.  Wow.  And I continue.  I also lecture on creativity.  You know, go to people and tell them how I work by myself. 
[00:38:30]  I discover juggling, magic.  It's a life that is a life of passion.  And as long as life continues, I will continue to exercise those passions.  Do you think your skills have diminished now that you're older?  No, no, no.  I think I'm not older.  I'm much younger.  I am more knowledgeable, more masterful.  No, I think my skills, yes, physically the body is saying, leave me alone, I'm getting old.  But I disregard that.  I think it's the mind that pulls the body.  You had a guest before who, you know, who is racing around the world and his legs are new legs. 
[00:39:00]  So I salute that, you know, my hat off.  Can you get him on a wire maybe?  Yeah, absolutely.  Now that would be it.  Scott, what do you think?  Hey, maybe that's the next challenge.  This man has undoubted spirit and you can do anything.  That's basically what this film, Man on Wire, is telling.  Yeah.  Is that if you have a dream, stick to it and nothing is impossible.  So, yes, I continue to walk the highway, absolutely.  I had a question for him.  Sure.  Scott Rigsby, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, mentally, I mean, when I did the Ironman, it was more mentally draining than physically 
[00:39:30]  draining, so I had to prepare myself mentally.  So over and over, I dreamed about crossing that finish line.  I dreamed about every portion of the race, the swim, the bike, and the run.  And did you do that when you were preparing for these performances?  Absolutely.  Well, the chemistry of the victory that you just outlined is exactly the one I believe  in, except I am not formulating it so clearly as you just did, and I'm not living through  it so exactly. 
[00:40:00]  But it's intuitively.  I know if I look at how I prepare for a high-war walk for the past 45 years, it's exactly  what you said.  It's much more in the head.  And, you know, if the body is asleep, you wake it up and you pull it by the sleeve.  I mean, the body is an instrument.  So that's why I'm not really interested in those climbers and those stuntmen who do, you  know, impossible things.  It doesn't move me because where is the human theater?  Where is the soul?  You know, the mechanical work of a human body doesn't interest me.  You have to inspire me.  You have to move me. 
[00:40:30]  You have to be a poet, you know.  So, and that cannot be explained.  No.  Could someone climbing, though, have the same, could someone who climbs buildings, I mean,  it's amazing to me that the guy does it without equipment, could he have that same spirit that  you have?  He's just not a tightrope walker.  Well, but it will look differently than just climbing and climbing and stopping.  Yeah, he's calling it.  And climbing.  He basically thinking.  Somebody will make an opera vertical on a facade and turn around and do a kind of ballet  and you call it theater in the sky.  I will be the first one moved by it.  And when I see a human being getting higher or longer than the other guy and, you know, 
[00:41:00]  climbing nine peaks within eight hours to be in a book of records, I think these people  don't understand life.  Life is not to be the highest, the strongest, and the newest.  Life is to be meaningful and to inspire people and to do something beautiful.  So, really, and since I was not born in the world of the circus, from the beginning,  I took the wire as a stage.  What interested me was theater.  Of course, my stage is kind of thin and I'm not allowed to make one mistake because I 
[00:41:30]  won't be here to talk about it.  But that's the beauty of my theater.  It's a theater where you have to put your life entirely, not gamble it, but, you know,  carry it across in full focus.  Jimmy, basically saying they're hacks and all they're doing is climbing a really, really  tall ladder.  Philippe, can I ask, you said you've been doing this 40 years?  No, much more.  Can I ask how old you are?  Yeah, I'm kind of 60 or something like that.  Getting close to the big six on me.  But, you know, I have disregard. 
[00:42:00]  I know teenagers that are already dead and I know 95 years old people who are my best  young friends.  Right, right.  Hey, you've never answered the question why.  Oh, yes, I did answer.  I said there is no why.  Yeah.  But that's how you answered it.  Well, you know, I think also it's a...  Because that's the obvious question everyone would want to ask you.  Why would you, like, walk between the towers?  A real painter, if you interrupt the painter who should be painting all day long by such  a foolish question why, the real artist painter will not know why. 
[00:42:30]  Or the answer will be, well, I have no choice.  I wake up and I have to paint.  If you think and if you realize why, it's something else.  So I always had this kind of passionate calling.  I mean, I didn't decide to put a wire between the Twin Towers.  The Twin Towers called me.  I was a young, self-proclaimed, self-taught wire walker.  I wanted to use the wire as a stage.  How absurd, how poetic.  And then I was looking for great places.  And then I see six years before they were built, I see an announcement that one day those 
[00:43:00]  towers will be built.  And right there, I was an 18 years old imbecile.  Giving away the movie.  You're giving away your own movie there, Philippe.  I'm following your example from the beginning.  But anyway, you're right.  This movie can be seen even if you know what the subject is.  Now, what are you scared of?  Well, I'm scared of things crawling on the floor with too many legs or with not enough  legs, like snakes and spiders.  I'm not very comfortable.  But that's stupid.  It's because I didn't put my mind into studying them, you see. 
[00:43:30]  Well, how about we put a few of those on the wire and we get a little...  Oh, well, I have to read of that.  We'll make it a little more interesting for you.  What if I am across the Grand Canyon and I see a tarantula coming?  Well, I'll have to think about that.  You ever thought about snakes?  You ever thought about doing the Grand Canyon?  Yes, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  I actually, I had a big project there and it's still semi-alive.  But I need an art angel to sign a check.  You know, it's always the same.  I'm not the only artist who needs the motor to his dreams.  The, what's it called? 
[00:44:00]  The balancing pole.  The balancing pole.  Now, put your hands facing the sky like this, yeah.  How long actually is that?  Well, it depends of the walk and it depends of the wind I'm going to meet up there and  it depends of the tension of the wire and what I'm going to do on that wire.  So, it's a dancing parameters.  But at the World Trade Center, it was enormously heavy.  It was 40 pounds.  Wow.  And it was 28 feet long because I knew I would have to be fighting turbulence and I knew at 
[00:44:30]  that height I would be so fragile.  I needed my arms to be longer and heavier.  I mean, this is not a trick.  The balancing pole, if you don't know how to maneuver it, it's going to make you fall  off the wire left and right.  But once you know how to move it around, it helps you a little bit stay on that wire.  If you were to drop that, if for whatever reason you were to drop it, would you have  been able to make it to the edge of the wire?  I'm really not a good guy to answer the if questions.  I always frown that, you know, if you were a tree, what tree would you be?  Well, I'd be a solid oak.  But anyway, so there is no if for me. 
[00:45:00]  But if, I know, I know there is no if because I cannot put myself in the mind of what if.  You see, I narrow all the unknown into a moment where I am certain nothing will happen to  me.  So I cannot entertain the idea.  If I drop my pole, I cannot drop my balancing pole.  I cannot be allowed to drop it, you know.  But don't you have a process of elimination you go through where you have to go through  the worst case scenarios to prepare you to deal with them? 
[00:45:30]  No, no.  It's not that.  You do positive creative visualizations.  Well, it's half and half because when I train, I think of Murphy is the worst scenario.  I think a big wind or I think something breaking in the wire.  But because I am the engineer for my project and I direct my rigging crew and I practice  sometime even with the right direction of the wind for months before a big walk, then  as you can imagine, if you were following me for months before a walk, you would not say  this guy is crazy.  You would say this guy is crazy about details and about respecting his life and the life of 
[00:46:00]  the buildings and he doesn't leave anything to chance.  And what is Murphy is a thief that, you know, used chance to bother you.  So I cannot be attacked there.  There is no if for me.  But then when you're going through something like, aren't you going through, like when  you're checking the building out and you're going through, you're going through so many  steps to make sure that it was going to work.  You are in a way looking at, well, if security is here or if this guy is here or if this  doesn't work, this is how I get around that.  Okay, in the case of the World Trade Center Adventure, it was illegal, as you know, and 
[00:46:30]  there was a lot, a lot of question marks.  What if in the middle of my walk, some guard comes and starts banging on the cable or, I  mean, that would be the if that there was nothing I could do.  But it's not true because I was looking constantly on both sides.  You know, I did U-turns and I walked back and forth and I was really looking at any human  being approaching the anchor points.  And if they would have approached the anchor point, I would probably stop walking, sit on the  wire, hold myself with one hand.  All this in a way is answering your question of if, but it's just that it's my knowledge 
[00:47:00]  of the wire that saves me and my knowledge of myself.  If I thought I was invincible, I would already be dead.  You see, there is a certain humbleness in being the best at what you do.  Jimmy, we got to take a break.  Man on Wire is the documentary.  We got this.  This is just a horrific 911 story.  Listen to this.  Imagine calling 911 as a fire in your home begins to spread.  And the dispatcher puts you on hold.  Oh, boy.  That's what happened to a woman in Pennsylvania.  By the time someone took her call, it was too late. 
[00:47:30]  Listen to what happened.  Oh, boy.  It took six rings before an operator answered her call.  One ringy thingy.  It finally did.  911, can you hold one second, please?  I can't.  It's an emergency.  It's on file.  Brenda Orr, bedridden with multiple sclerosis, was placed on hold.  It took 25 long.  Well, there's the first problem right there.  I mean, when someone goes, when they ask you the question, can you hold, and someone goes, I can't. 
[00:48:00]  No, I'm on fire.  Then that's not good.  Some people go, yeah, I can, because the emergency isn't an actual holy-ass emergency.  She was in a holy-ass emergency situation.  Wow.  And they even asked her, can you hold, and she yells, no, I can't.  Brenda Orr, bedridden with multiple sclerosis, was placed on hold.  It took 25 long seconds before a second operator finally picked up the call. 
[00:48:30]  Thanks for holding.  911, where's your emergency?  911, I can't.  Hello?  911, the bed is on fire.  Are you still in the house?  Yes.  All right, well, you want to get out of the house?  No, I'm disabled.  The bed is fully and flinged.  Ma'am, you still there?  By the time the emergency response team arrived at the scene, it was too late.  She had died in the fire.  Disciplinary action has been taken against 15 members of the Bucks County Emergency Communications Staff.  They weren't paying attention to their job. 
[00:49:00]  They were just not doing their job properly.  How did her bed catch on fire?  Was she smoking in bed?  Midnight oil fan.  How couldn't she move the covers?  I got it.  Yeah, I guess she's disabled, so she probably couldn't move.  That is horrible.  How the hell did a bed catch on fire?  You know something?  Probably was smoking. 
[00:49:30]  I would bet smoking, yeah.  Which in that case, who cares?  All in with smoking.  In that case, who cares?  If something happened, like a plug shorted out behind the wall and lit the bed on fire,  then there's a...  That's pretty horrible.  Even smoking, though, you don't plan on burning to death in your own house.  The bed's on fire.  Dun, dun, dun.  All right, get out of the bed.  Oh, here it is.  How do we sleep while our beds are burning? 
[00:50:00]  How do we sleep while our beds are burning?  No, she's dead.  Oh.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  That is just horrible.  Yep.  Oh, well.  She probably...  She didn't die of smoke inhalation, man.  She burned. 
[00:50:30]  Burned.  You could hear it in the background.  Yeah.  Ow.  You could hear it kind of like this during the phone call.  I don't know.  I'd drag myself with my teeth on the floor or something.  Stop being lazy.  Get the hell out of bed.  Roll.  Do something.  I think the worst part is that she had multiple sclerosis.  Sclerosis, the guy said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You couldn't say sclerosis.  Nick, you got some?  What are you just saying?  He can't help himself.  What do you got, man?  This is just fantastic stuff.  I swear to God, the second you're like a 911 operator, I swear, I was like, please don't 
[00:51:00]  let her be black.  Please don't let her be black.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  I'm going to have to put you on hold a minute.  911, may I help you?  Oh, no.  Because one time I called, like, my roommate at NYU was like, he had like a seizure or  whatever, and I called him like, 911, and I was like, I could barely hear her.  I'm like, listen, can you speak up?  I am speaking up.  Oh, God.  I was like, I'm beginning to understand racism.  Why are you being so angry? 
[00:51:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock, and also with me, as always, is primetime Sam Roberts.  That's right.  How are you doing, Sam?  I'm great, and I'm happy to be here with you.  Me, too.  And this bit involves Stalker Patty.  She's in studio, and for some reason, Jim has a weird attraction to Patty.  He does.  He's always somewhat turned on when she takes her clothes off.  Stalker Patty is one of the mentally deranged freaks who shows up to our studio every now  and then. 
[00:52:00]  She's how old?  She's plus 50 now.  And she's a virgin.  Yeah.  She got her name because she stalks or stalked Opie for a long time.  And, yes, Jim is somewhat attracted to her.  And in this piece here, Nick DiPaolo is in studio, but Jim tries to have intercourse with  Patty above clothes.  Dry humping.  Yeah.  Like, fully clothed.  Trying to demonstrate that Patty can't get aroused.  So, well, she's never had sex.  No.  She's never been involved at all. 
[00:52:30]  She doesn't know any of this.  So we're trying to teach her how to do sex.  How to do sex.  Very masterfully and poetically put by E-Rock.  Can Patty figure it out?  I don't think so.  But here it is.  On the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're listening to the worst.  Worst.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is the fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's pretty stupid.  Patty, here comes Stalker Patty.  Hey, Patty, could you shuffle in on those fucking things you call feet? 
[00:53:00]  Very funny.  It's a sexy outfit.  It's like two skateboards.  Wow, Patty, I like the shorts.  It's nice.  That's right.  You fucking dress like Sissy Spacek heading down to do laundry at the creek.  Hi, Roland.  Oh, God.  What?  I don't know.  Where's your socks?  Oh, even I can't make fun of her.  Where's your socks? 
[00:53:30]  Certainly not stuffed into your bra.  No.  I'm not wearing one.  I know.  You're not wearing one?  No.  Let me see your tits.  You've seen them before.  But they're fucking nice.  Just lift up your dumb shirt.  Come on.  Patty, you've got great tits.  Nick, this is for you.  Fuck that.  I'm eating.  Let me see your breasts, please.  I don't want to spit up this omelet.  Patty, I helped give you your first orgasm.  All right.  Will you just show the boobs?  Remember when I diddled your clip?  You got scrambled.  Now look at fried. 
[00:54:00]  Patty, what do you got over there?  What do you got for me?  Can I lick your nipple?  Got something I showed over there?  Nice.  Yeah, Jimmy's back being single, so could he lick your nipple?  Oh.  I'm trying to bang this broad, Henry.  You're going to fucking help me out of what?  I'd do favors for you, right?  Exactly.  I'm trying to bang the cryptkeeper, Henry.  Can you help me?  Move over to Jimmy.  What?  All right.  Oh, Jimmy.  All right, lift up your shirt.  How about I won't lick them?  I'll just touch them a lot of fingers.  It's not yucky. 
[00:54:30]  Has anyone ever licked your nipple before?  No, it's yucky.  Somebody give me a napkin, quick.  If she is...  You've got to lick her nipple.  If you go to lick someone's nipple and they say yucky, you're going to have a fucking...  How about you lift it?  I won't lick it.  I'll just touch it real quick.  Come here.  Don't lick it, please.  I'm just going to lick it.  Disgusting.  Get a hold of yourself.  Why is it disgusting?  I'm looking at a fucking appendectomy scar.  Did she get fucking stabbed on the way over here?  No, it's an appendix scar.  Are you sure?  I thought you lived up in Washington Heights. 
[00:55:00]  I've had that since I was eight.  You should at least let guys have...  You should put an appendix in.  You should at least let guys have sex with a scar.  Be a good place to start.  Perry, let's see the rack.  You were never eight.  All right, there's the rack.  I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm going to touch you with my fingers.  Just let him feel you up a little bit.  Is this fucking legal?  No.  This is like rape.  I'm going to fucking end up on Judge Judy.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm not going to hurt you.  She likes me.  Those aren't that bad, really.  They're nice.  Come relax.  Come here.  Come here.  Are they getting hard? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, you'll like that.  No, I'm embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  This is unbelievable.  Don't be embarrassed.  Just let him play.  What are you feeling?  I don't feel it.  What are you thinking about while Jimmy does it?  It wet.  Cup or cunt?  No.  Patty, let me just lick your nipple real quick.  Come on.  Patty.  That might be fun.  We'll laugh about it later.  Yeah.  It'll be a good laugh for everybody.  But that's so far.  That's the beauty of it.  Well, that's what we do.  We're being silly geese.  I know. 
[00:56:00]  I've never heard of him.  And they're weird.  He's really weird.  Oh, is he?  All right, here comes him.  That's not that bad, Patty.  I'll be honest with you.  I didn't realize he was weird when he told his stories about jerking off with Voss with  a chick in the middle.  Yeah.  And while he's smelling ketchup and trying to vomit the bathroom.  What the fuck?  Present your nipple to Jimmy.  Come on.  I'm not going to bite you.  Just now move your nipple into Jimmy.  I did not bite my toast yet.  Oh, shit.  I swear to fucking God.  That's definitely a bite taken out of it.  Patty, just close your eyes.  I'm not going to hurt you.  Come here. 
[00:56:30]  Come here.  Come here.  Come on.  Don't worry.  I know, but I'm doing it anyway.  That's so disgusting.  Don't worry, Patty.  Pick your shirt up, mother.  Mother.  You're so weird.  Let him just suckle.  Let him suckle a little.  Patty, just let him suckle.  Come on.  Come here.  Am I going to do anything?  He just wants to suckle.  Do you want to continue having VIP treatment?  Let Jimmy lick your nipple.  Are we doing a radio?  I didn't do it yet.  Come here.  Come here.  I'm going slow.  Come on.  Relax. 
[00:57:00]  She's making a yucky face.  Believe me, this hurts my soul.  That's so disgusting.  Move your hand.  Move your hand.  It's like every day they've been on.  That's so disgusting.  Move your hand, Patty.  I'm not going to hurt you, Patty.  Relax.  Relax.  Just relax.  Relax.  Come here.  Patty.  Patty.  Hold her.  Why do you keep pushing a whip?  I'm not going to hold her belt loop so she can't move away.  She'll come.  She'll come.  Come here.  Closer.  You already did it.  No, but I didn't do it right.  Hey, I'm doing it slow.  Come here.  Let them suckle on them.  I'm not going to hurt you. 
[00:57:30]  She's like every day, like she hates it.  Come on.  Who's the well-built person out there?  She fucking is not happy with this.  No, huh?  Who's that lady?  No.  No.  Miss.  Who are you?  Okay.  Who is she?  Who's the lady?  She's looking at me like she wants to fucking cut my balls off.  Steve, who is that?  I'd be glad to.  Hold them.  I don't know.  Steve's putting the...  Who's that?  He's doing the slit the throat kind of thing. 
[00:58:00]  Of yours?  Oh, all right.  She's not a boss.  No, no.  Oh, okay.  Fine.  Give me a tits.  All right, Patty.  I thought she worked for X7 and wanted to fucking kick me in the balls.  Yeah, present the nipple to Jimmy.  Let's get this over.  I've been with the worst.  I've got to be honest.  I'm going to use my stupid nipple.  I didn't mean that.  Move your hand, Patty.  Jesus Christ.  I just can't help it.  It's a natural reaction.  If you pull away one more time. 
[00:58:30]  I'm embarrassed.  You ever see Cape Fear?  That's how I show you.  I'm embarrassed.  It never happened before to me.  Well, I've never actually done this with a fucking cadaver, so we're going to...  Thank you.  I'm kidding.  Come here.  Barely.  Come here.  Her last date was Michael Dr. Michael Boddy.  Well, Patty and I have a weird history.  Yeah.  You don't say.  No, but I was the first one to ever touch her breast. 
[00:59:00]  I was the first one to ever touch her breast.  Before her dad?  Come on.  No, Patty's been very...  She's a virgin.  She's a virgin.  Of course I am.  Patty is not a virgin.  Yes, I am.  Are you serious?  Yeah, with all this...  The fuck are you waiting for?  A crane to fall on your head?  Just get busy.  No, I don't want to dye a veins or something.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Well, don't fuck a Haitian with a needle in his ass.  You'll be fine.  Well, it's got to be a committed relationship.  Well, what are you going to do about the breast?  What if I gave you something on your breast through the saliva?  That doesn't...  Of course it can.  That happened once. 
[00:59:30]  Yes, it did.  That's how I lost my aunt.  You better look it up, Patty.  Better look it up.  It kind of felt good, though, right?  She had nipple aids.  It felt weird.  I don't know about good.  I can't decide on that yet, but it felt weird.  Patty, what are you waiting for?  Seriously, you're 52.  I'm waiting for a committed person.  I don't want to be...  Committed?  Committed?  ...that's going to beat me up or do something bad to me.  You know, I get scared.  You don't want to beat you up?  I do.  Who's going to beat you up, Patty?  You know who Steve Freed is?  You know, I don't want a guy that's going to control me or anything like that. 
[01:00:00]  I want to be somebody that cares about me.  You've been waiting forever.  Guys like that don't exist, for Christ's sake.  I know.  Just put on the lube and get out there.  Get in the...  You're sitting on the bench your whole life.  Let's go.  I want to be with somebody that I could fall in love with.  What kind of guy do you like?  Jesus.  Have you looked at a mirror lately?  Somebody like myself.  Quiet.  You know.  Somebody quiet?  So you're looking for...  Okay.  A retarded guy with no dick.  Yeah, because I'm a quiet person.  You're quiet? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I am.  You want a shy guy?  You have nice tits and they're going to waste.  I'm not shy, but somebody that I could click with.  You know.  I haven't met that person yet.  Sounds like you're on a remote.  No.  You haven't met them because if they're like you, you wouldn't meet them.  Because you're not...  You don't go out to meet people.  Yeah, Pat.  You've got to get out there, man.  That perfect guy for you.  I thought about...  I don't drink, but I thought about visiting one of the bars in, you know, on the...  You're going to visit it?  Visit a bar. 
[01:01:00]  Or something like that.  Can we get you a brochure before you go?  You want a drink?  No, I'm just visiting.  You know, a lot of them...  You want to visit a bar?  You want to tart it with that fucking sound?  Well, I don't know where to meet you.  I don't know where to meet people, really.  It's a great bar in Inwood.  Clubs or anything because you have to have a lot of money to get into those.  So I'm very limited in what I can do.  I hear a lot of excuses, Patty.  You know.  That's right.  I think you should get out there.  I'll give you $150 tonight.  You go to the Shark Bar.  What's a Shark Bar? 
[01:01:30]  Shark.  Shark.  Shark.  Where's that?  It's on the west side.  It's popular with the brothers.  Yeah.  Brothers?  Yeah, get yourself some, you know.  I don't know.  Why not?  Louisiana Black Snake.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  I want to go to a nice place like the Blue Fin or something like that.  The Blue Fin?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Blow Jacques Cousteau?  Come on.  Talk to me.  Yeah, but I want somebody that I could talk to about current events and things going on.  Oh, really?  Who likes the bowl. 
[01:02:00]  Who wants to fuck Mike Wallace now?  Once in a blue, blue moon, I like to take a little trip down to Atlantic City and walk  on the boardwalk and start.  What's blue, blue moon, Patty?  Atlantic City.  Atlantic.  I want to go to maybe two months or so.  All right.  I want to go to a city star.  What's blue, blue moon?  Blue, blue moon means once in a long time or once in a neon.  Oh, okay.  By the way, every walk with you is a boardwalk.  Thank you, Anthony.  No problem.  Well, she likes to talk about current events.  What's going on in the news?  Maybe we can introduce you to some... 
[01:02:30]  Let's see how this would go.  Oh, no.  What do you like about the current events?  Let's talk to somebody with a crane on his neck.  Yeah.  You know, that's because they're too cheap to pay workers' union wages and they hire, like,  lower paid people to operate them.  And they're not qualified.  They're all fucking union.  They're all union.  All these guys are union.  They're not getting crane operators outside the Home Depot, trust me.  They're getting scabs to fucking set up the cranes around Manhattan.  Do you know what the money they get for operating a crane? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, please.  I know a crane operator.  I'm sure that guy was like, well, at least I'm making a lot of money as he was plummeting  to his death.  Yeah, I make a nice dime.  They don't.  Right, why?  Kablamo.  Maybe because they're not as qualified.  Right.  Or don't know what they're doing.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to see you have this conversation on a loud dance floor.  You know, I can dance and stuff like that.  Oh, of course you can.  That's what I'm saying.  But, you know, I just don't want to be with a guy that's going to take advantage of me 
[01:03:30]  or hurt me in any way.  Thank you.  I get scared to death.  What's your favorite dance?  You ever do the Watusi in a shithead?  No.  Could you imagine the first fucking time she's laying there?  And, of course, with a lot of KY.  That first cock that just slides up inside her.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I don't want to end up with AIDS and diseases and stuff like that.  Oh, AIDS.  Who are you fucking?  What are you?  What are you?  Come on. 
[01:04:00]  What are the odds?  And AIDS takes about 10 years.  Yeah, you'll be dead by the time it kills you.  I want to live till I'm 103.  Oh, really?  103.  Why 103?  I don't know.  I don't want to die early.  Yeah?  104 is what?  You don't want to have AIDS.  That's it for the rest of your life.  And too many very young people have it.  They can never have a normal relationship for the rest of their lives.  Yeah, but they're all like choreographers and shit.  Yeah, you don't got to worry about that.  Two words.  Magic Johnson.  Exactly.  Look at him.  He put on 80 pounds after he had AIDS. 
[01:04:30]  It hasn't stopped him.  Yeah, but I wouldn't go with him because I'd get it back.  Oh, you're a racist.  Oh, you're a racist.  You're a racist?  No, I'd get HIV also.  No.  Oh, yes, you do.  It went away.  That's why they call him magic.  He's clean as a fucker.  I'm telling you.  You are contagious for the rest of your life.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's been fucking Isaiah Thomas for like two years.  Doesn't matter.  You're contagious for the rest of your life.  Listen to her.  You can give it to somebody else whether you're doing well or not.  But they keep testing him and it comes back negatively. 
[01:05:00]  I'm not making this shit up.  It's there for life.  He might be negative because he doesn't have a flare-up at that moment.  A flare-up.  A flare-up of the AIDS?  A fucking back injury?  Yeah.  A fucking cold sore.  They're not rickets.  Hemorrhoids.  He doesn't have a six-pound water blister on the head of his dick.  He's fine.  I just hope to meet a very nice gentleman.  Somebody a little old-fashioned who will open the door for me. 
[01:05:30]  Old-fashioned.  You look at my fucking name, Thomas.  Tesla.  Open the door for you like one of those basement ones when you wash storm door.  You know, someone that'll let me walk on the inside of the sidewalk and he walks on the  outside, you know.  Is that how it's supposed to be done?  What are you, a fucking crossing guard?  Jacket over the bus.  Yeah.  That's a knife.  To hide the fucking exposed wiring.  Patty.  You're so funny, Patty.  So, and you would have sex with a person like this? 
[01:06:00]  After, like, a committed relationship and that we were the only two people together and  he wasn't going to go with any other.  Right, right, right.  All that.  I know you're with the fucking questionnaire.  It's unbelievable.  But you would.  All that stuff is a guarantee.  You'd lay there.  I would prefer to also be married to him first than then.  Oh, no, you're really fucking stretching it.  Wow.  Yeah, you know, I don't know.  Yeah, there's plenty of 50-plus year-old women out there just getting married.  You do have, you have, your standards seem a little high.  I mean. 
[01:06:30]  What if he said this?  What if he said, I'll marry you, but first, you gotta let me put it in your shitter.  He wouldn't talk to me like that.  He might think you liked her.  Not on the first date.  I love you or something like that.  Oh, would it be great if some guy married her and then he just was the most despicable  fucking pervert?  Yeah.  Just grabbing her by the hand.  I'm going to fuck your mouth.  I'm going to fuck your face.  You're not going to suck my cock.  I'm going to fuck your face.  Come here, pussy face.  And there's a difference, bitch, and I'm going to show it to you right now.  Yeah.  You are getting your face fucked. 
[01:07:00]  And then he just grabs your hair.  No, he wouldn't.  You'd be like, whoa, whoa.  He looks like Vic Tabak from fucking Alex.  Just choking.  Just choking.  That's why you go out with a person for a long time.  Hold on.  He wears a sailor hat and a fucking tank top.  And his favorite hobbies are fishing, beating immigrants, and mouth fucking.  And you never knew any of it.  That's on my bio.  You can know a person who buys a mouth within six months.  And then he goes ass to mouth with you. 
[01:07:30]  He pounds your asshole.  Yeah.  Pulls it out.  There's slight streaks of brown shit on his dick.  And he fucks your face.  He grabs your mouth.  And you don't want to open your little chiclet teeth.  But he fucking squeezes your cheeks so hard that you've got to open it.  And he shoves his cock in your face.  And you taste your own shit.  That's right.  I think he'd be in jail after that.  No, you're married.  It's legal.  It's legal.  You're stuck with a house of horror.  You're stuck with a kitchen making him a sandwich after that.  And he calls your ears. 
[01:08:00]  He says, bring the handles closer.  And he grabs your ears like handles.  And he holds on like he's doing dips at the gym.  The guy that I end up with will never hurt me.  He would be my companion.  That's not hurting.  That's romantic.  Patty, this guy doesn't exist.  His face fucking is romantic.  Sure, they do.  Well, he did, but he died yesterday.  I want to get Roland's opinion on Stalker Patty.  What do you think, Roland?  You've been hearing this horse shit for a while now.  Seriously, horse shit.  I don't know.  She's delusional with that. 
[01:08:30]  I mean, there's no dude like that.  What's wrong with having a few values?  I don't know.  You're 52 and that shit's drying up like a dog shit on my lawn in August.  You've been 53 in five days.  Really?  Oh, in a few days.  So maybe you can get one in before next Friday.  Do you want to squeeze my penis?  No.  It's kind of hard.  No.  Patty, just squeeze his penis through the pants.  I'm not fully.  I'm not fully.  I'm telling you.  I'm not fully.  I'm not fully.  I'm not fully.  I'm not fully.  I'm not fully.  I'm not fully.  I'm not fully.  Patty, what the fuck?  Through the pants.  I know.  Just to be a silly goose.  It's my birthday.  You have a thing.  You know that.  You can't get A's through jeans. 
[01:09:00]  So I do.  Oh, shit.  I forgot she had a little bit of a thing.  She knows your goddamn birthday.  Yeah, she's a psycho.  Daddy, hold the microphone for poor Patty.  Patty, you know you want to do it.  Patty, just give it a little squeeze.  Not too hard.  I'll teach you how to squeeze a penis.  Through the jeans.  I'll teach you how to squeeze a penis.  Come on.  Come on.  I'll teach you how to squeeze a Peter, as we say.  Yeah.  Think back to Thanksgiving when you were six at the kids' table.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Patty.  Get in there.  For my life.  I know.  That's the beauty.  You're married.  I'm Vic Tabak.  I come home.  I've spent the whole day at the fish hatchery. 
[01:09:30]  I smell the showers broken.  Vic Tabak.  He's got a blood-stained apron on.  Yes.  What Vic Tabak's job is, is I have to remove the vaginas from all the salmon at the fish  hatchery and throw them into a pile.  It's a weird job, but I'm the man who does it.  So I'm dirty and disgusting.  And I just want my Peter squeeze when I walk in the door.  All right.  Squeeze is Peter.  Sounds like an idea for a pilot.  Yes.  Come on, Patty.  Get in there and squeeze.  Come on, before it gets totally soft.  I don't even know where it is.  Yes, you do.  It's right below his chin.  Yes. 
[01:10:00]  Give it a squeeze.  I think you see where it is.  I've never done this before.  I know.  Just gently.  Don't do it too hard.  Not too hard.  Don't do it like it's a boomerang.  Just get in there and squeeze this Peter.  Okay, give it a squeeze.  Go ahead.  Easy.  I'm embarrassed.  I know.  Me too.  Believe me.  I'm so embarrassed.  Oh, Danny?  Could you go around the other side of her so that I'll talk people?  Just pretend you're at the supermarket picking out the cucumbers.  Patty, my dick is running for the hills.  Go ahead.  Squeeze this Peter.  Come on, Patty.  It's right there.  Get in there.  Just give it a little.  Give it a little.  Give it a little.  And don't just touch it and move it away.  Give it a good honk.  Patty, if you don't. 
[01:10:30]  Give it a good honk.  One, two.  Don't.  Go ahead.  You can do it.  Go ahead, baby.  Look at her.  She really wants to.  It's like a date I had in college.  Just embarrassed.  She really wants to.  Just gently.  It's not a pit bull, for Christ's sake.  Pet it.  Now, you touched it with your pointer finger and thumb.  Yeah, you just pinched it.  Much the way a coroner picks up evidence.  How about you touch it with your whole hand?  Look how excited Patty gets.  My whole hand?  Yeah.  Patty.  It's a dick.  You don't pick it up like that. 
[01:11:00]  Patty wants cocked so bad.  Patty, just grab it with your whole hand.  The palm of your hand.  Just squeeze it hard.  Just rub it.  And squeeze it a little bit.  That's all.  Oh, you're not going to.  Come on.  What am I going to do?  Oh, my God.  She thinks he's going to cum.  She thinks he's going to fucking cum.  Your tits aren't that nice.  Jesus.  She has a subtle touch.  She grabbed it the way you grab a fucking banister when you're falling.  Patty.  Patty.  A little decorum.  Get in there.  Leave your hand there a little while.  And she grabbed half the head and half thin air. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  So she pinched the helmet.  Patty.  You've got to grab the shaft gently.  Not hard.  Just grab it.  Give it a shake.  Rub it like that.  Roland, show her how to do it.  Show me with your mouth.  Show me how.  Rub it.  Rub it.  Get in there, Patty.  Rub it.  You know, I'm large.  Just soft.  Soft.  This is so weird.  I know.  Let's be honest.  You are weird, too.  No, don't squeeze it like that.  I don't know how to do it.  It's not a spider you're throwing out.  Just rub it like that.  Yeah, just rub it, Patty.  There you go.  It wasn't enough.  Shoot it like that.  Trust me.  I've more than met the expectations. 
[01:12:00]  No, you haven't.  I want to come in.  I've exceeded expectations.  Just rub it like that.  Go ahead, Patty.  Go ahead, Patty.  Get in there, Patty.  Rub it.  Like this?  Rub it nice.  Yeah, not just rub it.  Rub it nice.  Spock.  Now with your fingers separated like that.  Spock.  She was giving you the Vulcan.  She had her fucking Vulcan fingers open.  She was giving you the Spock.  It's awful.  It was like being jerked off by James Colbert.  This big fucking athletic thing.  Oh, my God.  She has fucking hands like the Starbucks cup mermaid.  I feel like I'm going to pass out. 
[01:12:30]  You feel like you're going to pass out?  Get back in there, Patty.  Just rub it, Patty.  Rub it like that.  Just rub it.  Rub it like it's a little agabadoosha.  Get in there.  You're doing a fine job yourself.  I know I'm trying to teach you.  Come on, Rub it.  A genie's going to come out of it.  Like that?  Yeah.  Keep rubbing it.  Okay.  Patting it like a dog's head.  I did it like five seconds.  Yeah, she just rolled in her hands.  That's nice.  Who are you making, Cinnabons?  She needs a rolling pin.  I'm not getting hard.  I'm getting the reverse of hard.  My dick's actually inverted.  Running up into my asshole. 
[01:13:00]  I'm going to like four and a half, five.  Yeah, Patty, pull down your pants.  Patty.  He's going to rest his penis on your backside.  He's just going to rest it on your backside.  Patty, put some Tabasco on it.  No, Jimmy's not.  Put some Tabasco.  No, Jimmy's not.  No, I think I've exceeded expectations.  You don't want him leaking a little clear stuff down your ass crack?  I'll jump in here, too.  No.  I'm not resting my penis on her.  You gave it a squeeze through the jeans, and now I have to tinkle.  That's why it's soft.  It wasn't your magical touch.  Yeah.  It was the fact that I had to tinkle. 
[01:13:30]  Patty, how about he leaks a little clear stuff down your ass crack?  No, he doesn't.  Yeah, just don't.  She's petrified of the clear stuff.  Jesus Christ.  I couldn't even watch that.  No.  No.  We're going to put a little on your lips.  Patty, how about he just jacks off on your ass?  No.  Or shoots a load of hot cum in your ass crack?  No, Anthony.  No?  How about this?  How about this?  If I just hold your butthole open and make a wee-wee.  No.  No.  I did enough. 
[01:14:00]  Patty, how about this?  It's like watering a plant.  Patty, just hear us out.  Hear Jimmy out.  How about this?  You and I pretend we're in a race, and you're in front of me about to grab the leaky baton.  But I run too far, and it gets stuck between your butt cheeks, and we spin in a circle,  and we make jokes.  No.  Why not?  Not think this.  All right.  Okay, Patty, how about this?  I'm sorry.  How about this?  Go ahead and go.  You gently just put your mouth over his cock.  No.  Come on.  Until he shoots a wad in your mouth. 
[01:14:30]  No.  How about this?  I don't shoot the wad.  A big, thick, viscous wad.  No.  How about you just hold the head, and you go...  No.  Like a gerbil, like when they want some water in the fucking tank.  No.  Danny, I'll tell you when he's going to come.  Yeah.  No, here's the deal.  I'll just...  Okay, I'll go as far as this.  I'll touch it for real.  You know, that...  Without any pants.  Yeah, I'll do that.  No, you won't.  But you can't have contact with me.  No, you won't.  No, just through my pants.  I won't let you touch it, Bear. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Wow.  I don't want to be physically touched.  Close the doors.  I think we got something going on here.  No.  Close the doors.  Let's lock Patty in studio.  And rape her.  Can I get out before you close it?  No, I'm not going to take my pants.  Of course not.  Why would you?  No.  You know, I wouldn't do that.  I can't let you do that to me.  Patty, would you let a guy come on your tits?  No.  Ever?  No.  Even, like, this magic man that you're married to that...  I guess the shit is out now.  I'm sorry.  I want to be a lady.  What if...  Well...  Too late for that.  What if he's fucking you, right? 
[01:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  And he pulls out and just comes on your belly?  Is that okay?  No, I don't want that on me.  You want it in you?  You want it in you, then?  No.  Then what's going to happen with it?  You want to be 52 and pregnant?  No.  You don't want to use a rubber.  I don't want to do that.  I'm sorry.  A rubber with your husband after you're through menopause and you can't get fucking  pregnant?  Where do you...  You use some KY to lube up that fucking old well.  We're not married.  Okay.  And then...  No, you're married.  No, we're not. 
[01:16:00]  And then he's pumping away with his gray ass hair fucking glistening in the nightlight.  His face is in your neck.  He's saying different names.  Tell him the story.  I can't let him have this.  I can't do that.  I'm sorry.  Not possible contact.  Where's he coming?  What's he supposed to do?  Where is he going to shoot her on a coffee table?  I can't do that.  Patty, where do you want him to come?  Where do you want him to orgasm?  Where's it going to go?  In a napkin or something.  In a napkin?  What are you at IHOP?  What the fuck? 
[01:16:30]  Where are you going to find this guy?  At IHOP.  I'm sorry.  There's enough...  There's single men out there.  That are willing to fuck you and come in a napkin?  Are you out of your mind?  It's somebody you're in love with who cares about you.  But that's what I'm saying.  This is the guy that cares about you.  Who puts this shit in women's heads?  Unbelievable.  Who puts this in these girls' heads?  It would be a good six months or more before we got back to the school.  Six months, he can come inside you.  If we're going steady for six months...  Steady.  Going steady?  Who the fuck are you, Sandra Dee? 
[01:17:00]  Who the fuck are you, Potsy?  Fucking Sandra Dee.  Are you going to be wearing his letter jacket?  Wait, fair enough now.  Patty has said that...  Well, wait till we get pinned.  If you're with a guy for six months and you're both in love...  And you're monogamous...  Dr. Norton.  Yeah.  And he wanted to...  If, say, Vic climbed on and he was inside of you...  Vic...  Did he back still?  Yeah.  That's who she...  I was extremely in love with.  Hold on, baby.  Do you like Vic Tate?  Your orgasm was coming.  And he said, like, in a pirate voice,  Wrap your legs around and be back. 
[01:17:30]  Because that's how he talks when he comes for no reason.  Between couples that are familiar with little fantasy and role-playing and stuff.  That's kind of fun.  What kind of fans do you like role-playing?  You know, just like...  You can make believe you're a woman.  You know, like fantasy type.  Well, Patty, what kind?  Give us a help.  Okay.  Fucking murderer.  I'm with the guy for a long time.  And he comes home...  Are you going to use that tone of voice, the whole relationship?  ...and I would have a uniform on like a maid.  And I would have nothing on underneath. 
[01:18:00]  Well, most people don't have anything underneath the uniform.  What do you think?  They put on a uniform over a prom dress?  Yeah.  I would...  You're going to be dressed like a maid?  Or dressed like a Playboy bunny or something.  No, you're going to stick with maid.  I can see maid.  Hold on.  Playboy bunny might be sexy.  Let's get some sexy outfits for Patty to try on.  Playboy bunny with the little ears.  Yeah.  A little French maid, maybe, too.  A little French maid outfit.  Maybe.  I'm trying to figure out the maid.  You should dress like the rabbit in Fatal Attraction.  But it would be a relationship. 
[01:18:30]  When you put on a strap-on.  When you put on a belt with a penis and a cap.  No, because I don't go that way.  How do you feel about Devo hats?  Let's say...  You know what?  God damn it.  Opie asked a brilliant question.  What if your husband, Vic, or your boyfriend, who you were in love with, when you were kissing...  This Vic is something.  Yeah.  If he said Patty...  I need to get popped in the shitter.  If he said, I need to get popped in the shitter.  And you said, what do you mean, Vic? 
[01:19:00]  And he said it was something that Flo would do to him at the diner.  He liked to be entered.  If he said, I need you to enter me.  And he had like a special strap-on belt.  And he just wanted to put his big Greek man legs on your shoulders.  And have you fucking treat his asshole like you're fucking drilling for oil.  I mean, I'm trying to say this nicely.  Yeah.  What, would you do it?  Yeah.  This is...  And before you put it in, he goes spitting it.  Yeah.  How long do you have to go steady before you would pop another guy... 
[01:19:30]  Another guy.  A guy in the shitter.  A guy in the shitter.  Make that strap-on look like a collapsing crane.  Six months minimum.  Six months leave a wreck on his ass.  Wait, six months and you might pop your steady in the shitter.  That gives you six months to get to know the person.  All right, so she might do that, Jimmy.  That gives you six months to get to...  So would it go from just talking to on six months later, you're fucking him in the ass with a dildo? 
[01:20:00]  Or do you like slowly start with stories about, you know, getting a little sexy?  Do you get sexy talk?  Do you do sexy texts?  What do you do?  All right, Patty, take your...  I'm happy we get sexy texts.  Hold on, we have a strap-on.  I love you.  Sweet love letters.  Patty, you say sweet love letters, but what about the dirty talk?  All right, Patty, take your jeans off.  Patty, your date is here.  There it is.  Patty, take your jeans off.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Why?  We're going to show you how to put this on.  It's not going in you.  We're not going to do it.  Don't worry.  It sticks out.  It's brand new.  Take off your jeans. 
[01:20:30]  It's a strap-on.  Just take your jeans off.  It doesn't go in you.  Have we ever heard you in studio?  Patty, it straps on.  You might not last that tweet.  You don't know a strap-on when you see it.  It straps on you.  She thinks it's a hat.  I know.  No, it's okay.  You don't have to be.  We're doing it as a goof.  You don't have to be.  You'll fuck a guy with it.  Relax, Patty.  Get your ex-exam panties.  Nice.  Radio fucking panties.  Fucking nice.  All right, look at that.  There you go.  All right, drop the jeans.  Could you take the jeans off, please?  Lose the jeans.  You look like you're fucking getting an exam.  Yeah.  Let's sexy this up a little bit.  She's got fucking ex-exam underwear on. 
[01:21:00]  She's a body like Iggy Pop.  They happen to be clean.  We know.  Oh, wow.  Fucking satellite underwear.  What the fuck?  That's her selling point.  They happen to be clean.  We all got them.  Step out of your jeans, Patty, please.  Patty, please.  We don't want you to trip and fall and fucking break your head.  Well, we do, but...  Yeah, we can get in trouble.  We got in trouble for it, so...  Patty.  Do you know how that straps on?  What?  No.  I've never worn it.  Not you, Danny.  I'm trying to figure this out.  Yeah, it's some kind of wacky contraption.  Where's fucking stupid Dave? 
[01:21:30]  Dave, he would know.  Is Eastside Dave here?  Yeah, he would know.  Of course Sam knows.  Sam?  Dave wouldn't know.  He just knows what it feels like from behind.  Patty.  Whatever you do, don't put this on YouTube or anything.  We're not going to put it on YouTube.  Come on, Patty.  They wouldn't do that to you.  You're crazy.  They wouldn't do that, Patty.  We'll put it on ABC at 8 o'clock on a Wednesday.  Yeah.  Those are really nice doily socks.  Jesus Christ, Patty.  What the fuck?  Look at how long it takes to get her pants off.  It looks like she's wearing those things that chicks put on their feet when they're trying 
[01:22:00]  on shoes at the shoe store.  That's what she's wearing is socks.  Yeah, you're not supposed to take those with you.  They're horrible.  You're supposed to give them back after you're trying on shoes.  Not for nothing, though.  For 52, she ain't that, you know.  She's not bad at all.  She's hanging in here, Jimmy.  She certainly is.  I've seen a lot of dents on younger bros.  All right, let's go.  Let's step into the...  I don't know.  Patty knows.  Patty, now around your forehead.  There you go.  Yeah, step in.  I don't know why.  Can someone show Patty how to put on the fucking strap-on dildo?  Step with your left leg into that one, and then we'll try to buckle this around you. 
[01:22:30]  I hope she falls over and bangs her head with a strap-on.  And pops her own shirt with that.  Falls over and it goes up her pussy.  I saw this at a fucking...  It's ugly.  It's ugly.  That was actually the dildo talking.  All right.  Wait, Patty, we're strapping the dildo on you.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, shit.  Come on, Patty.  All right?  What the fuck are you guys carrying?  Ew.  There you go.  That's just yucky.  What?  Now it looks like...  Is that why they call it the hot seat? 
[01:23:00]  Well, that's...  Yeah.  All right.  It's being strapped on.  Now, Patty, like, fuck around with it a little.  Yeah.  Play with it like you had a cock.  Hold it in your hand.  Yeah, hold it in your hand.  There you go.  A few people have used that before, so just don't get shit on your fingers.  Patty, look.  You got a dick.  What do you think?  I don't like it.  No, leave it on.  Leave it on.  Leave it on.  Just stand there with a cock for a while.  That's right.  Now grab it.  Is she allowed to walk around the block like that? 
[01:23:30]  Grab it and wave it, like, angrily.  Yeah, like, eh?  Act like a guy.  Hold your penis and say something like that.  Hold your penis.  Talk like a guy and grab your cock.  Grab your cock and talk like a guy.  Let's go.  What would you say?  Grab that cock and say something.  Say, thank you, E-Harmony.  Yeah, I wanted to join Lava Life, but I don't know how to upload my picture.  Lava Life?  Lava Life?  I don't know how to take my picture from my space and put it onto there.  I wouldn't worry about it. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Well, I'll help you with Lava Life.  Can we get Patty to walk around the block with the strap on?  No, I will not.  Come on, Patty.  No.  We'll have a little parade.  People know me.  What's it to you?  Who knows you?  Who knows you?  Who?  Not outside.  No.  The crane operator's dead.  She's a sexy way of saying no.  People know me.  Yeah, that voice is turning me on.  Who knows you?  Besides wash vans.  People from Starbucks will be out there, and I've worked in their stores before.  No.  What are you hunching over for?  This looks like an army physical.  No.  Patty's going to walk into her own Starbucks with head on. 
[01:24:30]  Yes.  That's some cock you're supporting there, Patty.  Patty, I'll buy you.  That's some cock you're supporting.  This is a...  Let me tell you.  It's a miracle I went this far.  I wouldn't classify it as a miracle.  Yeah, a miracle.  Fucking miracle.  She's comparing this with walking on water.  Wearing a rubber dick.  He turned fucking one loaf into a thousand loaves, and Dumbella put on a fake penis.  Patty.  It feels weird.  What?  What?  It feels weird having a cock? 
[01:25:00]  How do you think it looks...  Put it in you.  What do you think it looks like when a guy jerks off?  Go ahead.  Do that.  Yeah, show us a guy jerking off.  Show us what a guy looks like jerking off.  Show us a girl.  Well, I see it on Paltalk sometimes.  I've gone into a...  Not with your camera, but you don't.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  She goes...  Guaranteed, they've never seen you.  She thinks they're jerking off, but their fingers are down their throat.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Start over, because that was amazing.  Do it again.  Do it again.  I see them do this and do this and do this and do that. 
[01:25:30]  Patty's demonstrating how guys jerk off on Paltalk.  One more time.  Don't do it.  Like this, and then like this, and like this, and then like that, and then they stop and  go like...  And then they go like that.  Hold on.  And at that point, I go click.  What happened?  You ever see somebody do the money shot and come?  No, they don't do that.  I don't see that on Paltalk.  She was moving like the fucking guy dancing in The Godfather.  I even saw one guy do this. 
[01:26:00]  Like that, and snap it back, and then I clicked all right in.  Hey, do we have any fake pussies in the office?  Yeah.  All right.  Get a fake pussy.  We're going to have Patty have sex with him.  Let's see Patty's fucking style.  Yeah.  We want to see how you have sex.  We'll get a fake pussy.  That's right.  You lube that up, and you're going to fuck the fake pussy with your fake cock.  Here's what we'll do with the fake pussy.  I'll put it over my ass cheeks.  Right.  So you can act.  You are crazy.  No, no, not again.  Would you really?  Why not?  Oh, that would be awesome.  You can act like you're giving.  We got to sleep. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  We need the big fake pussy.  We have the big fake ass.  What the fuck is that?  Who the fuck brought the, who the fuck brought the, who the fuck brought the, what is that?  That's a pink sock.  What is that?  A fucking hairy queen took our fake pussy home.  It looks like Qbert.  It's Qbert's nose.  What the fuck is that?  More importantly, someone took the fake pussy home.  I have it on my desk.  I put pens in it.  Fucking bro.  What's up, Danny?  Fucking Great Dane's pussy.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Jimmy, would you put that on your ass, I guess?  No.  Is that a tasty freeze?  Well, you know what we could do?  We could, we could like duct tape it to the console so it doesn't move around. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  That sounds good.  And then give it a good fuck in there, Patty.  Wait, do we have like a Playboy centerfold or something?  We got to have some kind of, you know, stimulant.  Do we have a large cardboard cutout of a wrestler?  All right.  Patty's got the strap on on.  I got to pee real quick.  So I'm right back.  Oh, wow.  You got to jerk off.  You got to do something silly in there.  How about a quick break as we set up for Stalker Patty's first fucking?  Yeah, that's good.  Stalker Patty, wearing the strap on, we'll be fucking a fake pussy.  It's a long day of radio.  You guys are underpaid. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  I really want to get a fucking...  Fucking genius, this stuff.  I'm so tired.  Genius.  Fucking despicable human beings we are.  Make a fake woman and we'll be back.  Hey, this is Nick DiPaolo.  Are you listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony?  The worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rox.  Sam, we're continuing on with Patty's sexual education.  Yeah.  Now we have Patty using adult toys to demonstrate sexual intercourse.  Well, again, we want to show Patty how to get aroused.  So, if it didn't work with human interaction, let's try, you know, the use of sexual AIDS. 
[01:28:00]  Does it happen?  Not like AIDS passed through sex.  It could be either one.  Yeah, let's give her AIDS, too.  Yeah, let's do that.  Throw it on top.  Plus, we show her two girls one cup.  Here it is.  On the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let the show die, then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  They should be shot.  Patty's going to poke me in the fucking pussy ball.  Yeah, I don't know how we got to this point, but basically, we got Stalker Patty in studio. 
[01:28:30]  She has a strap-on dildo on.  Jimmy has agreed to let Patty fuck the fake pussy that Jimmy's going to have between his  ass cheeks, basically.  Yeah, I'm going to hold it with my boxers on, because it's all sticky with tape.  And it's going to kind of feel, it looks like a proboscis.  And I'm going to hold it between my legs, which is going to poke out.  I'm going to look like a fucking, a chimp.  Have you ever seen a chimp pussy?  With that big red.  It already looks like you've been pink-socked. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, it looks like I'm already coming off a fucking hard night.  I saw this on Leave It to Beaver.  Jimmy, this is the lost episodes.  Could you put the thing between your legs just to see how it's going to look?  Yeah, let's see what it's going to look like.  Let me just keep my jeans on.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  I dropped the motherfuckers.  I'm going to keep my motherfucking boxers on.  Jimmy has boxers on.  All right.  Jimmy's falling down his boxers.  All right.  Always.  Adjusting his dick there.  All right.  You're getting a big laugh.  Turn around, Jimmy.  I want to see how this looks. 
[01:29:30]  Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Anthony.  Here it is.  That's what Patty's going to be, that's what Patty's going to have sex with.  You know what this bit needs?  One more thing.  Yeah.  A real cock.  I mean, no, he's been slipped.  The listener's in studio for this bit.  Come on.  Yes.  Let's get the, we've got a nice crowd.  Get the bleachers in here.  The crowd has been growing all morning long.  We've got at least 20 people out there.  We're going to quickly bring the bleachers in, and then Stalker Patty is going to start  her a fucking. 
[01:30:00]  I don't really take.  What?  What's wrong?  Is this a bad time to talk about the presidential election coming up?  Not at all.  It's what Hillary's doing to the Democratic Party.  Oh.  Get it.  Yes.  She's talking about it.  I tie it all into Hillary.  All fucking sticks of butter legs.  All right.  The bleachers are in studio, and the fans are filing in.  Get a good seat.  Come on in, guys.  Just like Wrigley feel, huh?  Yeah.  That's right.  This is like a Rockwell.  All right, Patty. 
[01:30:30]  All right, Patty, stand up.  Now, let's put my vagina in.  All right, Jimmy's going to put his vagina in.  You bet Jimmy is.  How many times have we heard that in the last two weeks?  All right, now, can you guys get a good view?  Wait, get a mic in front of these guys.  They got a mic in front of them.  Where's the best camera for this one?  Holy shit.  What a mess this is.  I'm getting queasy.  And Mrs. Voorhees is having fun?  All right.  All right.  All right, Jimmy. 
[01:31:00]  Wait, I got to get a one.  Hold on.  Just, Patty, don't get lube all over my underpants.  Wait, are we lubing up the cock or the fake pussy?  I say you lube.  What do you think, guys?  I don't know.  Ask the audience.  Remember?  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm sorry, Danny.  We have to go to the other side again.  Yeah, you vote for what you think.  All right.  Sorry.  All right.  Yeah, the audience.  It's audience participation Friday.  So should we lube up the fake pussy that Jimmy has between his ass cheeks?  Oh, I would say it has to be.  Jimmy is now bending over. 
[01:31:30]  This is going to be on the Food Network.  This is horrific.  This is horrible.  Jimmy is all the way bent over.  He's got his boxers on.  Jimmy's CD covers.  Now, Patty, I'm bent over.  My vagina is...  She's fucking mesmerized by it.  Patty, what are you thinking?  Get a mic up, Patty.  It's called presenting, by the way.  You're presenting.  All right.  Jimmy is certainly presenting.  Hold on.  Let me make sure it's nice and snug, Patty.  I'd hate to have you think I was a loose girl. 
[01:32:00]  Fucking size queen.  That's right, Patty.  Is it nice and tight, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm clenching my legs in an attempt to say no.  Let's just put that in that.  Yeah.  We'll let Patty lube up her own cock.  That's how it works, Patty.  Patty will lube up her own cock.  This is actually educational.  Yeah.  Patty, lube up your own cock.  It's brand new lube, so you don't have to worry about nothing.  That's right, Patty.  All right, Patty?  Patty's putting some lube on her left hand.  Get a lot on there.  Get a good one. 
[01:32:30]  Patty is lubeing up her cock.  Lube it up good.  Yeah, lube it up.  Jerk it a little bit.  Yeah, Patty.  Get it all around.  All righty.  What are you doing?  This is going to hurt.  See how unsexy that is?  Do you love me?  All right.  Do you have a tissue?  Exactly.  A tissue.  A tissue.  Could you say something unsexy?  No, you're going to be coming into the tissue.  Correct.  It's amazing the thing she comes out with during a sexual moment.  Yeah.  Hey, do you got any sandpaper and a Yankee hat? 
[01:33:00]  Fucking Patty, please.  I'm presenting.  Yeah.  All righty.  My pink fat lips.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  You're still doing it.  You got to wait for the thing to move.  Jesus Christ, Patty.  Hold on.  She goes, where does it go in here?  How many options are there, Patty?  It's either there or you're going to fuck my shoes.  Jimmy, your pussy's drooping a little bit.  My pussy does droop.  It's hot in here.  Hold on.  Jimmy's pussy's drooping a little bit.  Whenever it's warm, my vagina gets shy.  Should we go sideways so the listeners can see this?  The listeners can see it.  Patty, the vein goes underneath. 
[01:33:30]  Hold on.  All right.  Jimmy's hoisting his fake pussy up in the air.  She's putting it in sideways.  Come on, Patty.  I'm clenching my butt cheeks.  No, wait, Patty.  You just don't put it in.  Say something sexy.  Let's go on, Patty.  Make me feel like I'm a lady.  Jimmy's bent over the console.  Patty's behind him.  Focus.  Dick in hand.  Act like a guy for us.  Shit, I'm not in this show.  Am I?  It's a little hard.  Yes, it is. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, okay.  Sound like me.  Fuck.  I don't know why.  Think.  Talk like you think a guy would talk.  Okay, sweet baby cakes.  Here they go.  Holy shit.  What are you doing, Elliot Spitzer?  Okay, sweet baby cakes.  Sweet baby cakes.  Here they go.  This is the fucking Harlem Globetrotters theme song.  In Long Island.  You can do better than that, Patty.  Come on, Patty.  What are you doing?  I'm going to have to stick it in.  Come on, Patty.  Oh, I've been going out with you for a long time.  Yes, you have.  Oh, God damn.  She's got to establish a fucking relationship. 
[01:34:30]  Even in dirty talk, she has to get the commitment.  Are you crazy?  Let's go through the whole role play.  There was traffic on the Long Island Expressway.  I'm going to bottom out in your seat.  Oh!  Bottom out in your seat.  Wow.  Where'd you learn that?  Sesame Street?  What the fuck?  Come on, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Talk dirty to it.  Let Jimmy and Patty talk a little bit.  Patty, go ahead.  Talk to me.  Tell me that you love me and what you're going to do to me. 
[01:35:00]  I love you and I'm going to have sex with you.  I'm going to bottom out in your seat.  I don't know what C means.  Patty, we're a couple.  Use language like that.  All right, well, let's just try to pretend you're Vic.  I'm Patty.  Yeah.  I'm going to bottom out in your dippity-do.  Oh.  What, in an old lady's hair product?  What's a dippity-do?  That's what I had to do when I swallowed one of my replacement teeth. 
[01:35:30]  I had to dip my fingers in dew.  Nothing on that one.  Sorry, I'm Patty, not Jim.  Jim would have had a good one.  I don't.  All right, Patty.  Let's go.  Let's go.  He's got his headphones.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Patty.  Patty's getting all sexy.  Patty.  Oh, go slow.  Patty, it's radio, so you've got to explain what's going on.  Go slow.  Oh.  I got it inside the big city.  Go slow.  I'm a lady. 
[01:36:00]  Patty, call it a pussy.  Say, like, talk dirty.  Say, now I'm going to fuck your pussy.  Now I'm going to F your pee.  What does that mean?  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Finish my pie?  What does that mean?  Finish your pie.  F my pee.  All right.  Oh, ow.  Is it in?  Yeah, it is.  All right, fuck him.  Go back and forth.  Treat me like a lady.  Go in and out, Patty.  I am.  No, you're not.  You said you were going to bottom out. 
[01:36:30]  You only got the tip in.  Come on.  Yeah.  Grab his hips and pull him in towards you.  This is like this old house.  Like, fuck him.  Like that.  Now his hips.  Grab his hips and fuck him, for God's sake.  Not my spine.  What's the matter with you?  You're fucking my leg, Patty.  Hey, fucking Lassie, you're humping my leg.  I'm a tip-toe-er.  What can I say?  You're a tip-toe-er?  Tip-toe-er?  What's that mean?  I tip-toe through the tulips.  Yes, you should.  Another 40-year-old reference. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, it's awful.  Jesus Christ.  Tiny Tim fucking reference.  She should tip-toe through a fucking, an IED field in fucking Southern Iraq.  It would be kind of love.  All right, I know.  Put it in.  You send me.  Please just fuck me.  You send me?  Come on, hurt me.  Out the window.  Put it in.  Don't go in any further.  Yes, you can, rookie.  Bottom out.  This is like Yankee Workshop.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Patty, pull out and shove back in.  And repeat.  Hold my hips.  There you go.  Hold his hips.  That's right.  Not his back.  His hips.  Hold him by the hips. 
[01:37:30]  Fuck him.  What are you doing?  Fuck me.  You are one lousy fuck.  All right.  She's doing all right.  She's not.  No, she's bottoming out and you see.  She's got to hold the penis.  Hold on.  Let me reach under there.  Hold the vagina snug.  All right.  Jimmy's holding the vagina snug.  Now, go ahead.  Push it in.  Are you enjoying this, Jimmy?  I'm Patty.  Yes, I'm enjoying it.  Make me feel like a lady.  My lips are chapped. 
[01:38:00]  All righty.  I think we're on our set of twins by now.  Can I?  Set of twins?  Oh, my God.  Patty, you didn't come yet.  You don't say all righty.  You don't say all righty.  I've been doing it for 10 hours.  Patty, 10 hours.  Talk dirty.  I know.  Well, at least you've got improv skills.  Talk about how you're going to fucking come and stuff.  Please.  Patty, come on.  You've got to go to outer space to a world that no one's been walking on before.  Very smooth.  That's some great sex talk.  Seriously.  It's really good.  Out of space to a world she's giving.  I'm trying, though.  The beginning fucking dialogue from Star Trek she's giving. 
[01:38:30]  Fucking Bill Curtis says sexier things on his show.  Bill Curtis.  On the night of November 9th.  You're not being such a good story.  The forensic files.  You should help me on my trip to Atlantic City next week.  I'm doing it.  Atlantic City.  Atlantic City.  Atlantic City.  Patty, how does it feel to, like, have sex with a pussy there?  I remember seeing the diving horse off the steel pier.  I can only imagine.  I want to fart so badly.  Somebody did the Lindy.  I'm trying to push a fart out.  I only hope he doesn't do it this rough with me. 
[01:39:00]  This rough?  You fucking haven't even broken my cherry yet.  You're fucking jabbing my cherry like it's a fucking spider web.  It's still standing.  Put the cock in farther.  Make me fucking submit.  I can't do it any further.  Yes, you can.  Push it in, you little silly goose.  Jimmy, screw fart.  It splatter all over.  Dude, I don't care.  Right now, I'm so fucking...  You don't have no idea.  You must...  Talk to me.  Teach me a lesson so I can fucking force out.  Why didn't I take Metamucil? 
[01:39:30]  Talk to me.  Wow, she spanked you.  I teach you a lesson.  I learned you well.  Talk about how you're going to come.  Yes.  Talk about what schools you're going to send your kids to.  Spank me.  Let Nick show you.  Nick, get back.  I'm going to...  Yeah?  Okay.  I just came.  No, no.  I'm just going to...  I can tell by the tone of your voice.  No, that was unsexy, Patty.  Talk to me.  Spank me.  Fucking make me want it.  You want it.  You want it. 
[01:40:00]  Easy now.  You might break something.  Oh, God.  Good one.  And build up to an orgasm, Patty.  Yeah, build up like a...  I know you want it.  You've seen porn?  You've seen, yeah.  You've seen what it's like when a guy fucking shoots a load?  Come on, put it in me.  I turn the channel too soon.  Of course you do.  You do not.  Come on.  I can't watch the channel.  All right.  All right.  Make like you're shooting a load in him now.  Yeah.  I just...  Oh, I just did.  Wow.  What the hell was that?  That's so good.  Did you come or just take a shit?  What was it?  It's like on a rollercoaster. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, she's riding the cyclones.  You know, Patty, this was just as important for me as it was for you.  You think this is an accident, Patty, that I'm taking one near my shitter?  I'm giving it a shot.  I've been dumped in my relationship.  I'm giving it a shot.  I might like this.  It's 39.  It's time for a change.  It'll be a whole new dimension on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:41:00]  Okay.  Oh, shit.  All righty.  Well, all righty.  Should it be over by now?  Yes.  Your life?  Yes.  All righty.  I got a note from Governor Patterson.  I can't get more.  All righty.  Just...  Oh, wow.  What happened?  A clitorectomy.  Oh!  My pants came down.  What happened?  Patty's taking the dildo off the strap-on.  It looks weird. 
[01:41:30]  And it just...  The dildo...  I mean, the fake pussy just flew off of it.  Yeah.  Like, snapped off of it.  Oh, my God.  It feels like real skin.  Yeah, that would be...  What do you think it's going to feel like?  Oh, you like that, don't you?  A fucking cylindrical piece of metal?  Yeah, but that at least feels like it's plastic.  That feels real.  Oh, feel that, then.  Feel that.  Yeah.  Wrap your hand around it.  Yeah.  Wrap it around your hand.  That's the whole idea, Patty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, suck on that thing.  No.  Oh, Anthony, stop.  Oh, that's why she draws the line.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  No.  Oh, fuck Jimmy and a fake pussy, but...  I just simulated it fucking ass-fucking for now, but I'm not going to put that in my  mind.  You're not a virgin anymore.  How does that feel?  Well, if I was a guy, I wouldn't be a virgin anymore.  Well, wait till your fucking future boyfriend finds out you did this in front of a bunch  of people.  Yeah.  It's going to be hard to find a nice guy now.  You fucking whore.  It would have to be somebody.  Oh, my God.  Is this where the emotional abuse comes from?  Yeah.  Now we've just got to pound it with some emotional abuse.  Holy shit.  I'm witnessing a felony here. 
[01:42:30]  This is unbelievable.  That was kind of fun.  Why not?  Sexy.  Well, uh...  That was.  That was like watching the Iron Chef.  I want to thank 5-Hour Energy for sponsoring that last bit of radio.  Yeah.  That's great.  That was sponsored.  Yeah, we hand out the 5-Hour Energy to the listeners when they stop by to check out the  show.  It wakes up your brain and gets you bright, alert, and focused without the jitters or the  crash later in the day.  5-Hour Energy.  Go check it out this weekend.  I think we also have to thank AdamandEve.com for supplying us with the lovely... 
[01:43:00]  Oh, the sex toys.  Oh, really?  I thought you got those at Target.  Patty, into the mic, please, Patty.  Into the mic, Patty.  Pretend it's a dick.  That's it.  Do you...  I know we've given you a vibrator.  Do you use that at home?  Yeah, she does.  Well, I got to admit it, you know.  Yeah, well, sure.  But I think every adult does that.  Well, yeah.  So what do you think of when you used your vibrator at home? 
[01:43:30]  I guess, you know, after I've had a very stressful day, and I've been under a lot of stress  lately.  Wow.  Is it curling iron?  It loosens you up.  Oh, it loosens you up.  Wait, what is she stressed about?  What are you stressed about, Patty?  Not meeting Mr. Right?  No.  You work at Starbucks.  I have...  She does?  Well, I'm in a...  I'm going into a debt consolidation program next month.  More sex talk.  To help make all my medical bills and stuff.  Wait, a debt consolidation?  So they're going to tell you, like, to fucking put the money you save for stamps?  I couldn't think of anything else. 
[01:44:00]  Really inexpensive.  How much debt could you be in?  Tens of dollars?  There's debt consolidation.  They're going to give her a bunch of penny rolls.  Here.  Consolidate your...  Consolidate those in these rolls and bring them to the bank, you idiot.  80 pounds of penny.  Oh, Patty.  I have a lot of debt.  You know, on my XM bill, I'm paying them off $25 a week.  Holy shit.  So I'm turned off it the next month until I could get paid up.  She's got a priority.  How is she paying for XM? 
[01:44:30]  Hold on, Patty.  We're trying to help you out.  How much do you owe XM?  I owed them, like, I owed $103.  I gave them $25, so now I'm down to, like, in the 80s.  She's paying off a VIG for fucking XM.  My fucking heart is breaking.  Yeah, I'm paying off medical bills and stuff that I owe for clinical tests because I have...  What kind of tests?  Well, I'm developing a lot of arthritis in all my joints.  And it's painful.  I didn't notice it while you're fucking Jimmy. 
[01:45:00]  Well, it's painful.  It's around my wrist and my hand.  I think we should call her a health provider.  I don't think she has arthritis.  I'm about $3,000 in debt for a lot of tests and stuff like that.  All right, well, I'm not giving you that, but I'll give you a $60 towards your XM bill,  and then you can get $20 for somebody else.  All right, don't clap.  It's $60.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Now we've got to dig or else we look like assholes.  We look like scumbags now if we don't give our money.  As soon as the show is over, she has to make the brrrr sound on my balls.  Patty, I got $4.  There you go.  That girl, Patty, pick it up one at a time.  Take back you four times. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, here's 50 for you, Patty.  Here you go, you fucking prostitute.  There you go.  Take it away.  I'll have something on the night table for you.  Now scram.  You gave me a deep dick in and sang for your supper.  We got it.  All right, yeah.  Patty, I'm just a guest.  You turned on today.  Yeah, you're just a guest.  Patty, I'm just a guest.  How much do you owe altogether?  That'll cover you.  Well, it originally was $100.  I got $303, but I started making payment arrangements. 
[01:46:00]  No, all your debt in your whole life.  Yeah, to go to debt consolidation.  I have it all in a little green book.  I'm about $3,000 in debt to everybody in the world.  I have people who owe me up and stuff.  Everybody in the world.  Where do you live?  I live in an SRO.  My rent went up another $100, too.  What's an SRO?  Something retarded?  Single room occupancy on 43rd Street.  Do you share a bathroom with people that are also SROs?  Only with my cat.  You shit in a box? 
[01:46:30]  No, she shits in the box.  I know.  Oh, you potty mouth.  You potty mouth.  You use the S word.  Everybody uses that word.  Oh, okay.  No, they don't.  Yeah.  Not a lady.  A lady doesn't use that word.  No.  Wow.  You can get a house in master.  I'm a lady in different ways.  60 bucks.  60 bucks in master.  I will admit, I do have a mouth on me.  You use it for anything.  Jesus Christ.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  So, you're dead.  I don't feel good about myself.  Well, that's why I'm in the consolidation program. 
[01:47:00]  They'll take everything.  I might even reduce my debt.  Enough about the consolidation.  Awesome.  I know.  It's that fucking accent that's going through me like a knife.  Isn't it the worst?  I hope they, like, possess your computer and fucking chair.  Oh, no.  So, you have to just stand there, pick up pens.  I'm taking off my panty.  Let's make her work a corner or something.  Yeah.  That we can.  Do you realize you could whore yourself out and make, like, hundreds and hundreds a day?  You could probably do that.  No, she couldn't. 
[01:47:30]  Those women die early.  Dude.  Oh, she would.  Except for Sandy K.  She'll live forever.  You put her on, like, Craigslist.  Somebody will pay good money to fuck a 50-year-old version.  Imagine this fucker showing up at your house.  I think I have an idea.  Oh, Danny, yes.  Danny might have an idea.  They still have, like, live shows somewhere in New York, right?  Yeah.  Maybe we can get her in a booth or something and have all the fans go down there and pay  a dollar.  Oh, like, uh...  And she has to dance for them.  How about we do it right here?  Like a Keith world or something.  A show world or something.  We've got a bunch of fans here right now. 
[01:48:00]  We could, like, do this right.  We've got a poll.  We've got the platform.  You want to dance?  And maybe the fans can throw you some money?  They're not going to just throw you money.  You've got to have to work for it.  You're going to have to earn it.  Like a working girl.  Do a striptease.  Like a working girl.  A striptease.  All right.  Turn the blitzers sideways for the stripper pole.  That'll buy a lot of ibuprofen.  Wow, here we are.  Exotic West Coast dancers. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, Patty, what song do you want to dance to?  The Emperor's Club.  Hi, Client 9.  Leave your socks on.  What song do you want to dance to?  I don't know.  Dr. Feelgood?  Motley Crue is always good.  No, you know the fucking stripper song.  You two mysterious ways?  Oh, what?  The old time?  Marshy's Playground.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  Chair or something.  Candy.  Candy, yes.  The candy song. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  What's the candy song?  Oh, you'll know in a second, honey.  It was by Sammy Davis Jr.  I don't know the titles, but I know my music.  And you don't know the fucking music if you don't know the titles.  Exactly.  Thanks.  What do you say?  Your ear picks up sounds?  I know music.  How cute is this girl?  Yeah.  Oh, we should have her warm up for Patty.  You're right.  I would have taken the underwear off and just said, fuck the fake pussy.  God, she'd get lined up.  Yeah.  Miss, I don't know how to ask you this, but do you ever shit in somebody's mouth for a few dollars? 
[01:49:30]  Patty?  What song?  She goes, I wouldn't take money for that.  How about a George Michael song?  Oh.  George Michael.  A George Michael song?  All right, which one?  Come on, we've got to do Marcy's Playground.  Well, George Michael's just going to...  Candy.  What song?  Come on, Candy.  I do that Candy thing.  I don't know what it's...  I don't...  All right, it's Marcy's Playground.  How about the theme, the Barney Miller? 
[01:50:00]  Nobody knows.  The whole audience is like 20.  Yeah, that's an awful theme.  Dickie Punchcock is very confused.  I didn't some feedback.  Dickie Punchcock?  He says...  Of the Punchcocks?  Yeah, she lives in an SRO.  I thought she had SROs, which are shriveled, rotten ovaries.  Oh, that had a hurt.  Yeah, that was just...  I was in here because she's way over there.  Heartful.  All right, Patty, you ready to dance for everybody?  And if the audience likes what they're seeing, you can throw a buck or two at her, or preferably 
[01:50:30]  change right at her head.  He's kidding, sir.  The fucking...  The lunatic in the Phillies hat stood up with a fistful of change.  Right.  She was just kidding.  All right, Patty, ready?  Yeah.  If you do well, you might, I don't know, gain another seven or eight bucks here.  Have fun.  Can we get the music playing?  She is a trooper.  I'll give her that one.  All right, turn it up.  Go ahead, Patty.  This is you.  All right, Patty.  You going to dance or... 
[01:51:00]  Look at her go.  What are you doing?  Go, Patty.  You're not even moving yet.  All right.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  It's kind of wiggling from side to side right now.  Yeah.  The audience is horrified.  No, it's pretty sexy.  Go ahead, Patty.  That's not bad, Patty.  All right.  They're getting into her a little bit.  She's got her jean capri pants on.  I've been to Bird's Place in Ronkonkoma at 1130 in the morning and have not seen strippers  this bad.  All right. 
[01:51:30]  The show is off.  Patty is topless.  Wow.  That's starting to throw money.  Wow.  Don't pick it up yet, you greedy.  Don't pick it up, Patty.  Yeah.  Make believe you don't see the money.  That's what a good stripper does.  Right.  All right.  Now she's working on her jeans a little bit.  I'm going to have to go to a shrink after this.  Yeah.  They like what they're seeing so far.  Do they?  We see pink, we see green.  Yeah.  Oh, you heard that, Patty?  You show pink, you'll see green.  Wow.  Now unzip those sexy fucking Dutch boy paint shorts. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  She's slowly ripping the jeans off.  Body like that.  It was chasing Reese's Pieces.  Patty's down to the XM satellite panties.  Jesus Christ.  There she goes.  Kind of wiggling from side to side.  That's good.  There's some change going up there. 
[01:52:30]  A few quarters.  That's a little Patty.  Oh, my God.  She's going for the pink.  Don't.  She's sexy.  I'll give you 20 if you don't go any further.  Let's show it.  Oh, she's teasing.  She is a tease.  She's teasing.  Wow.  She's pulling the pants down a little bit, showing butt crack in the back.  She's leaving something.  She puts a little ass on her, man.  Does she?  She's teasing.  Oh, she showed a little of the pink and then pulled her pants back up.  Very burlesque show life.  She's moving like she's in a body cast. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, get that hair out of the way of those dits.  That's it.  She moves the hair around a little.  Come on, Patty.  You know what they want.  You know what they want.  If you did this in a tree house, you'd get arrested.  Apparently it's all right when it's on the fucking...  This is our tree house, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  You guys are fucking really crazy.  All right, come on, Patty.  Patty's teasing the pink and they're not...  They're getting frustrated now.  Uh-oh. 
[01:53:30]  She's pulling down her...  Now, what the fuck?  There we go.  She's thinking about pulling down the pants.  All right, hold on.  Pull them up.  Good music.  Pull them up.  We'll go to the second song.  Now another song's got it.  All right, Patty.  A lot of money coming out for her.  All right, here's the second song.  A lady's choice.  Just keep thinking about how much your wrists hurt.  Yeah, this will pay for that arthritis medicine.  Very good, too.  Yeah.  There she goes.  She's just popping.  She's getting back into it. 
[01:54:00]  She's rocking now.  She's down to the satellite panties.  Oof.  You know what's funny?  The whole audience is still watching.  Oh, somebody took their money back.  You're not happy.  Not happy?  He made change.  Oh, he made change.  I came for the Jew in the back.  What the fuck?  She's not an ATM machine.  The fucking guy made change.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  All right, Patty.  You know what you got to do if you got to get a few more bucks. 
[01:54:30]  Money shot.  That's right, Patty.  You know what you got to do.  Put on your shirt.  That's why they call it the money shot, Patty.  By the way, Patty will be available in the back room for blowjobs after this dance.  In the champagne room, also known as our office.  Patty working the pants.  Oh, what the fuck?  Wow.  Nick has turned away.  What's wrong, Nick?  That's great.  Patty, slide him down.  What are you doing?  Patty, what are you doing?  You're only getting changed because you're not giving the people what they want.  I've seen more attractive dancers than Mos Eisley. 
[01:55:00]  What's that?  That's Spaceport from Star Wars.  Patty, what are you doing?  You got to remove the panties and then the money will be a flyer.  Come on, Patty.  Show the pink and the brown.  Yeah.  Some pink and some stink, Patty.  All right.  Here we go.  She is totally nude.  There she goes.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Patty, you should bend over.  Anthony Clubhouse.  Show the mask crack.  That's good. 
[01:55:30]  Bend all the way over, Patty.  Slap that ass.  Slap that ass.  You got to turn around and slap the ass.  Do the ass slap.  Look over your shoulder and slap your ass.  There you go.  God.  Please, God.  Please, God.  Make that crane collapse on us now.  Wow, Patty.  Patty has a nice rump.  Jesus Christ.  Would you tag that?  Would you tag that?  Would you tag, Patty? 
[01:56:00]  Not if it was.  Tag it like a fucking rhino.  Like a fucking elk with a disease.  A disease.  Wow.  Let's over Stalker Patty.  There it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, that was Stalker Patty.  Make sure you tip her very well.  That was half dance, half gynecological existence.  Good job.  I don't know what the fuck that was.  Nice call, Patty.  She has a nice shorts if you're in fucking Kentucky noodling.  Noodling. 
[01:56:30]  See, Patty?  Here she goes.  Well, Patty.  Now you only owe 60 bucks to fucking exit.  There you go.  You're paying off that debt.  Boy, are you.  You can make some money doing that on a nightly basis.  Daddy, how much did she collect?  She made a fantastic 25 bucks.  25 bucks.  Not bad.  25 bucks for a life.  25 dollars.  Patty, you want to do individual lap dancers now?  I'm out of money. 
[01:57:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm out of money.  There's our listeners.  Look at her, picking up on money like a real stripper.  She sure is.  She's like, do you validate?  You're right.  All right, Patty.  Good job, Patty.  Not bad, Patty.  Seriously.  She was working the poll.  You're not shy.  You're shy.  You fucked me in a fake vagina and then took off your clothes for money.  You're not shy. 
[01:57:30]  You're an Amish hooker.  I'm shy.  She strapped out a fake cock and gave me the business.  How are you?  I licked your nipples.  How are you shy?  You just did two fucking dances for money.  Naked.  You're completely naked.  That's not shy, Patty.  That awful dance.  Robert De Niro.  Shut up.  You dance like the fucking robot on the front of that Queen album.  News of the world?  I usually don't talk very much. 
[01:58:00]  What's up, Patty?  I usually don't talk very much.  I'm a quiet person.  Oh, you don't shut up.  Jesus Christ.  I'm emotionally scarred from this day.  Yeah, yeah.  This one's going to stick with me.  Yeah.  I don't think there's anything else to do except Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Wrap it up.  That's why it was that.  It was like watching Billy and Bear get on his own.  Look at that fucking mess.  I still can't get over it.  Line of the Day is brought to you by.  Oh, I thought you meant Patty again.  He's looking at the crane. 
[01:58:30]  What's the bigger wreck?  It's like, what's the bigger wreck?  Ricky Yam from Massachusetts.  He says it all.  He goes, she's making money to pay off XM, but XM is making more money off of her.  I love the irony.  Yeah, it's just a vicious circle here.  Don, fucking pay Patty's XM bill.  How does Patty not have a free XM?  Like, Patty, if you had any sense of fucking pride or balls, you'd walk up to Don Wicklin  and go, hey, give me a fucking subscription and a radio. 
[01:59:00]  She does more radio.  And he'd go, show me your pussy.  Yeah.  She does more radio than Fez.  Yeah.  She should be paid.  I would never walk up to someone like that.  Oh, it's only Don Wicklin.  Oh, she's still doing the Chi Act.  Oh, I would never.  I would never do that.  I would never.  Give me your balls.  Yeah.  Let me, teabag me.  I'm a shy girl.  Give me your Roman Wu helmet.  But that's the furthest I'm going to go because I'm a shy girl. 
[01:59:30]  I'm not going any further.  Five minutes later, she's in a tub with a Japanese guy putting an eel in her pussy.  I've been paying my own bill for five minutes.  All right.  We know.  We don't care.  Good for you, Pat.  How about you get another girl and shit in a cup and eat it?  That's right.  I'll do that.  I'm shy.  That's it.  I got that video.  Two cryptic retards.  One cup.  The video didn't work.  All right.  Yeah, I've never seen it. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, you haven't seen that one?  No.  All right.  I think we ought to cue that up.  All right.  What's going to happen?  All right, Patty, get over here.  I'm actually getting queasy, I swear to God.  Patty, get right in that seat there so you get a good view over here.  Patty.  And you'll see another complete disaster.  Relax.  Patty, I'll tell you this.  Patty, if you do what you see in this video, I'll give you $1,000 cash on the spot.  Where's Sam?  Sam's fucked.  Opie, I'll give you $2,000 if you don't make a deal.  Wait, not yet.  We've got to wait for Sam to come out.  Two Girls, One Cup. 
[02:00:30]  I will not do that.  Stalker Patty's going to watch Two Girls, One Cup.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Sam maybe got against the camera.  Yeah, let's...  Hey, Patty, get on mic, will you?  Pull the mic close to you.  She just doesn't...  You don't know how to...  Right there.  There you go.  Turn that way.  Pull the mic toward your face now.  All right.  This is Two Girls, One Cup with Stalker Patty.  Put the mic near your mouth, God damn it.  Patty.  Don't look away.  No, turn it.  There.  There you go.  Don't close your eyes.  Don't look away.  This reminds me of my job at Deary Queen.  Wait, here we go.  Oh, she went to the bathroom. 
[02:01:00]  What makes you say that?  Patty.  Patty, you got to look.  Look.  What are they doing, Patty?  Patty, watch it.  Hold on.  We stopped the tape.  See what happens?  Now rewind.  What are they doing, Patty?  I describe it.  It's a commercial for Tic Tacs.  They're eating it like an ice cream cone.  They must be on drugs.  Look, Patty.  You got to watch.  If you don't watch, we're going to rewind until you've watched the whole thing.  What the fuck?  And we'll make you do this.  No. 
[02:01:30]  Patty, watch.  It's disgusting.  Patty, don't make us fucking pin your eyes open like Alex in clockwork.  What's going on, Patty?  Explain.  Yeah, what's going on?  They're throwing it up.  And they're eating it.  They got to be on freaking drugs.  They have to be coked up or something.  Nice shit shake right in the mouth.  They have to be on drugs.  Coked up.  Yeah, because when I've done coke, that's the first thing I want. 
[02:02:00]  There's a nice heaping help in a shit.  No normal person would do that.  Exactly, Patty.  They would have to be freaking high.  You know what the weird part is?  They got a clean bill of health from their doctors.  Yeah.  Do you ever think Al-Qaeda has a point?  It's still disgusting.  Okay, bring in the cup of shit.  Patty.  Oh, stop.  No.  Yeah, bring it in.  Bring in the cup of shit.  Oh, hell no.  Patty.  I will not do it.  For all your debt, $3,000.  Wait, wait.  What won't you do?  I won't do that.  Do what?  Put it in my mouth. 
[02:02:30]  Put what in your mouth?  The shit.  Sorry.  For $3,000.  No.  Not even.  Cash.  Cash right here.  I will not do it.  $3,000 to eat it.  $5,000.  Five grand.  Bring in the shit.  To eat a cup of shit.  No.  You just got to lick it like an ice cream and then swallow what's on your tongue.  Let someone puke in your mouth for $1,000.  No.  What?  $7,000.  $7,000.  Patty.  No.  $7,000.  I can't. 
[02:03:00]  That's disgusting.  She's not hesitating now, isn't she?  That's disgusting.  We know it's disgusting.  You don't have to sell us on the point that it's disgusting.  What's disgusting?  The shit or the price?  No one's giving you $7,000 to fucking lick real ice cream.  Yeah.  You won't be in debt anymore.  You won't be in debt.  Here's some Bazooka Joe bubble gum.  $18,000.  No.  What do you expect?  It's shit.  Oh, no.  It's chunky monkey.  It's not going to make your breath anymore.  No.  Come on, Patty.  I'm throwing up just thinking about it. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, you're not.  He's got a very...  I don't know.  All right.  Sam, here we go.  All right.  We'll give you $12,000 to lick Iraq's tongue.  Oh, wow.  That's...  Wow.  That's mean.  That's very nasty.  I'm sorry.  You ready?  Two girls, one puke shirt.  Boo.  A boo.  They got to be on drugs.  How much would it cost?  No, no.  For you to eat...  Wait.  For you to lick shit?  No.  I will not do that.  How much?  No one...  No normal person in the world would do that. 
[02:04:00]  Would you do it for $10 million?  Would you do it for $10 million?  I'm going to pee.  Yeah, but then the whole world would know.  All right.  All right.  But you would do it.  You would do it.  I don't think so.  No.  10 million?  You wouldn't lick shit?  No.  All right.  You're crazy.  All right.  I am.  We rarely do this, but we'll throw in an XM radio, too.  Yeah.  I have one.  That's a deal breaker.  I already have one.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Well, look, you let us down again, Patty. 
[02:04:30]  What can I tell you?  I can't.  I'm sorry.  Same old boring shit.  I'm not eating shit.  I can't believe it.  Uh-huh.  I can't believe it.  I can't lick shit.  Sorry.  All right.  Can she, like, talk us through the video again?  Just, Patty, I want to hear.  You have to describe it for the audience.  They haven't seen this video.  I've got to see it again.  You've got to talk through the whole thing and let us know what's going on, okay?  Could you play with your nipples the whole time?  Yeah, be a professional broadcaster, all right?  Yeah.  You talk through the whole video.  It's about 40 seconds long. 
[02:05:00]  Here we go, Patty.  Tell the radio world what's going on right from the beginning.  And go.  They're licking each other's boobs.  Well, no, the one girl's licking the other girl's boobs, and at the same time, she's going  to the bathroom in a cup.  Uh-huh.  And they're licking it like it's an ice cream cone.  Uh-huh.  Keep going.  The tongues are going in and out, and they're acting like they're enjoying it, which I can't 
[02:05:30]  imagine.  And she's eating it.  She's swallowing it, and she's smiling.  And now they're throwing it up in each other's mouths, and oh, she threw it up, and this other  one is going to eat it.  Oh, God.  Now it's falling all over the other one's boobs, and now the dark hair.  Oh, and now she threw up again, and the other one's eating it, and of course, I'm not going 
[02:06:00]  to eat for the rest of the day.  Hey.  Right on.  All right, Patty.  Nice description.  Yes.  All right.  That was good.  Are we going to do line of the day now?  Yeah.  What else can we fucking do with this thing?  Patty, let's just toss her out the window.  Right.  Wouldn't that be fun to just throw her out the window and watch her hit the sidewalk?  God, I'd laugh.  Sorry, Patty.  I just thought it would kind of be fun. 
[02:06:30]  Line of the day is brought to you by Cardscan.  And get all of your contacts organized in just a few seconds.  Check out the device that nobody should be without at Cardscan.com slash radio one.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, like he had no control of his own ass.  I'm the ripper.  I ripped one, ripper.  Oh, well, great reaction from the studio audience after that runner-up line of the day.  It was funny at the time. 
[02:07:00]  Here's the next one.  Yeah.  Unless you say you want to see the head bob for a few minutes.  Whatever.  You know, you want the games on.  Right.  You're in the mood for it.  You're used to it.  Yeah.  Your new girlfriend had dental surgery due to a misunderstanding about politics.  Nice.  You guys have fun out there?  Yeah.  Nice, huh?  Making us work on a Friday.  We'd call these Friday shows in if the audience didn't show up. 
[02:07:30]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Terrell Owens showed up at the wrong place, so he's going to be here any second.  Yeah, he's a half a block away.  Is he in the spokesman for Alzheimer's?  Yeah, that's what he's going to talk about today.  He showed up the wrong address.  That's a damn good point.  Nick DiPaolo, Caroline's, two shows tonight only.  That was good.  In Times Square, 212-757-4100.  Highly recommend you guys go see Nick tonight if you don't have plans.  One more runner-up. 
[02:08:00]  One more runner-up.  What if your husband, Vic, or your boyfriend who you were in love with, when you were kissing...  This Vic is something.  If he said Patty...  I need to get popped in the shitter.  He said...  Thank you, Patty.  You're welcome.  Do you like us better than Ronna Fess?  I love you all the same.  Oh, boy.  See, it's slowly changing.  That's what they say first.  You're all dear in my heart.  Half politician, half whore. 
[02:08:30]  If you had to choose, which show would you choose?  If you had to.  If I had to choose...  Sean Hannity.  My first...  Well, you know, my first love was always the Opie and Anthony show.  Was.  Mm-hmm.  You know, because of the longest.  And then Ron and Fez would be almost tied.  You know, but I love them both the same.  But you have to choose.  It's either that or a beheading.  It was a great Hillary Clinton fucking answer.  She's giving... 
[02:09:00]  You got to choose.  Well, I love them both.  They're great.  Really?  Fucking Howard Dean over there.  You have to choose, Patty.  I'm sorry.  I have to choose.  If you had to choose one show.  Yeah, I was going to be beheaded.  Yeah.  I would have to go with the first show that I've been involved with.  That was Opie and Anthony.  Let's say that crane across the street is going to collapse and crush this studio and kill one of the shows.  Oh, I don't think that.  Opie and Anthony, morning or midday?  When does it happen? 
[02:09:30]  It would happen at night when nobody would see me.  Good answer.  I don't want to kill anyone.  No.  One of the shows has to get crushed by the crane.  You have to because it's either that or beheading.  What show gets crushed by the crane?  I don't kill anybody.  What show would you rather?  What show?  You are God for a day and you have to make this collapse.  Anthony, let's make it a little easier.  We don't know if they're going to die, but the crane definitely will come right through the studio ceiling.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  Can I have everybody get away and escape? 
[02:10:00]  What show?  What show?  What show gets the crane?  What show is here live when the crane collapses?  Yeah.  What show?  Come on, Patty.  Mad money.  It's up to you.  It's up to you.  Oh, I don't want to pick and choose.  Bring in the sword.  What show?  Come on, infidel.  All right.  We'll add big Kev's geek stuff, too.  Oh, wow.  There's a no-brainer.  Nobody would die.  No.  You have to choose.  Pick a show. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Who's underneath the crane wreckage?  Anybody.  Who are they pulling out from the wreckage?  You're in Iraq beheading if you don't answer.  What do you got?  They're not pulling anybody out because everyone's going to get out alive.  Who's bloody red head are they pulling out from under the wreckage?  You're making me do something extremely heartbreaking and hard because I love you both.  Make a choice.  What show?  You have to make a choice.  I just couldn't.  You have to.  Do that or beheading.  Patty.  Patty, I got an eight o'clock show at Caroline's. 
[02:11:00]  Make the fucking choice.  I'm going to punch you.  Patty, it's not really happening, okay?  So just fucking make a choice.  Just pick one.  Pick one.  What show?  I don't want to say.  Just say it.  Who gets the crane?  Who gets the crane?  Come on.  Penn Jillette.  Who gets the crane?  Crashing through the ceiling.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, God.  You're doing something with my mind.  Right.  Just say it. 
[02:11:30]  Come on.  What's left of it?  Patty.  All right.  Oh, God.  Just say it.  You have to say it.  What are you, sleeping with Fez?  What the fuck?  It's an obvious answer.  Patty.  Come on.  What show gets the crane?  You got five seconds, or I'm taking that duct tape and putting it on your head and tearing  it out.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, you know, I guess the morning show would be saved. 
[02:12:00]  It would be.  Oh, boy.  Ronnie's not.  Ron and Fez.  You wish Ron and Fez got crushed by a crane?  You suck.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you wish death on Ron and Fez.  I did not.  In a horrible crane accident.  We were testing you.  You don't answer that question ever.  You don't ever answer it.  Ever.  That's why I just mean it.  It's a good thing to say who your favorite show is, but you wish death on people.  I don't mean it.  I can't believe you wish the crane collapses on the Ron and Fez show.  May the Lord strike you down at Starbucks. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, you're horrible.  I don't mean it, though.  What a horrible, heartless bitch you are.  Oh, I don't apologize for the Ron and Fez show.  Fez is one of the sweetest guys ever.  I know he is, and I love them both.  And you want him to be pulled dead from the wreckage of a crane collapse.  I said everybody get out of line.  That's what you said.  I didn't pick anybody.  Holy shit.  Dave is a brand new daddy, and you want a widow and an orphan left as they pull his lifeless body out of the bottom of a wrecked pile of cranes?  And Ronnie has suffered enough trying to keep that whole goddamn show together. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, Ronnie would probably be the only one happy that it happened.  He'd be like, thank God I'm being crushed.  It's more painless than doing this show.  You know what?  Nobody would have a show in the afternoon.  Everybody would be on in the evening.  It's too late, Patty.  Too late.  You wish the crane falls on them.  No, I didn't.  It falls on them.  How are you going to do an evening show if the crane falls on the end?  Right.  What the fuck, Patty?  You know I don't mean it.  No, you said it.  Now that Ronnie and Fez and Eastside Dave and the crew, they cannot do radio anymore, who 
[02:13:30]  gets to do Uninformed now?  Because now that's got to go on.  Who does Uninformed if Ronnie can't?  You are cruel.  Well, considering that none of this is real.  All right.  But who does Uninformed now that Ronnie can't?  Look out the window.  What's there?  Yeah, there's a crane.  It's a fucking crane.  Just teetering out there.  Not real?  What do you see there?  I don't see a crane.  I see a building.  Right there.  That's a crane.  It's not even pointed.  It's got Fez's name on it.  It's not even pointed this way.  Wait, does it fall, dummy?  No, I love them all. 
[02:14:00]  Who does Uninformed now that Ronnie can't do it?  No, I love them all.  Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa.  This is like a bad father's abuse.  I have more love for everybody on Exxon than anybody in the world.  You know that.  This is like fucking torture.  They ought to fucking let us loose at Guantanamo.  Oh, my God.  Hi, this is Patty.  Known as Stalker Patty.  Well, you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot. 
[02:14:30]  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Hi, hi, hi.  That's what they call me.  Hi, hi, hi.  She's a freak. 
[02:15:00]  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the T-F-ing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite oral treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big fat juicy cock.  After I slap your bag, slap your bag, slap your bag, slap your bag, slap your bag.  Shoot your big wad and come right into my mouth. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  Oh, God.  After I slap you off, I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard-nailed cock.  Yes.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear. 
[02:16:00]  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh.  I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy having my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me. 
[02:16:30]  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  It's worse of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock, and you all know who he is.  He's Prime Time Sam Roberts.  Everybody knows who he is.  Anyway, so this is one of the bad guest day segments.  We have author Daniel Maurer.  Maurer?  Yeah.  Whatever.  On the phone, sorry.  And he's promoting his book, Brocabulary.  Sometimes here on the Opie and Anthony Show, we have a lot of guests that are pitched to us.  And there are times when we'll take a guest, specifically knowing that there will be a bad interview, just to mess with them. 
[02:17:00]  And that was the case with this Daniel Maurer's Brocabulary, where it's just basically a book full of play on words.  Pay attention to the end of the segment, where Opie takes special care of his book.  Take all time.  And the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  He gave it away.  No, that's just a clue.  It's the worst.  It's so good.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  Oh, boy.  How excited are you for our first guest, Jimmy? 
[02:17:30]  Is he on now?  Hopefully.  Is that him?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  We're going to be talking to Daniel Maurer.  Daniel Maurer.  Now, what is this book about?  I just don't.  Dude.  This is kind of crazy.  This is like, this is terrific.  I'm proud that we got him on today.  It's Brocabulary.  Brocabulary. 
[02:18:00]  Brocabulary, everyone.  The new Manifesto.  Yes.  So it says Manifesto of Dude Talk.  Yes.  Oh, he can't hear us right now.  It's Brocabulary.  Right.  So, like I open this up and I see a brologue.  Oh, boy.  It's like the brologue is instead of a prologue.  Sure.  Called a brologue.  Well, of course.  Other things like bromunication.  Yep.  It's like communication, but the way guys do it.  Sure.  It's like a guys thing.  Sure.  You know. 
[02:18:30]  How great is that?  Because we've all, you know, we all love talking like this.  Yeah.  Guys.  It gets you the chicks.  A man-ecdote.  Yeah, well.  Instead of an anecdote.  Yeah.  You know, things like that.  What about, and then we get into some of the vocabulary.  Like, uh, like, Harry Olis.  We got, let's get him on the phone because it's bromunication. 
[02:19:00]  Brodal recall.  Well, we got to, we got to talk to, uh, Daniel Marr.  We're going to learn about Mantis.  Look at this.  Hold on.  We're going to learn about MC Hammered.  Dude, I got to tell you this.  Roundhog.  What?  Brodal recall is a bro's recall for what you did last night while hit-shammered.  Like hit-shammered.  This is, uh, I'm actually looking at the ten bro-manments.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  The ten bro-manments.  Can we get him on the phone?  We are.  We're just setting it up.  Cock-a-doodle brew.  Because I got.  Cock-a-doodle brew.  That's a beer that you drink first thing in the morning.  What are, what are these cards, like, what are these called where you have, like, the  word and then the answer on the back?  What are they called?  Flash cards.  Like, kind of flash cards?  We're going to learn about.  Community, chest, or chance.  Right.  We're going to learn about, uh, manalyze.  Oh, and you manalyze something?  Uh, a guyberry.  Uh. 
[02:20:00]  God damn this stupid fucking.  Jersey girl.  Power talk audio.  Punxs of Tawny Jill.  We're going to learn what that means in bro-cabulary.  Oh, that's funny.  It's when, when a groundhog comes out of its hole and burns the other groundhog's shit.  Oh, a master date.  Oh, good gravy.  Oh, this is great.  And a PDA hole.  Good job.  Oh, God.  Let's talk to Daniel Maurer.  Yes.  Author of Bro-cabulary.  Yes.  A new manifesto of dude talk. 
[02:20:30]  That's right.  Daniel.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good to be here.  Uh, we were, uh, going through your, your book, Bro-cabulary, the new manifesto of dude  talk.  That's right.  And, uh, how did this come about there, Daniel?  Let's start with the, uh, the basics.  Yeah, what was the inspiration?  Sure.  Well, the inspiration, actually, I was at, um, what I would call a douche-tonation.  What's that?  It was douchey, like, bars and clubs.  And I was actually, I was standing next to a shower girl, this girl that, you know, 
[02:21:00]  washing in the shower.  Yeah.  Um, that's how douchey it was.  And a guy, this guy called me a bromo.  I actually, uh, hadn't heard that one before.  A bromo?  What's a bromo?  It's a word for bros who are so tight, they're almost homo.  And, um, I started trying it out on friends of mine and people were, were, you know, kind  of found it pretty hilarious.  So, um, I realized there was something to this, uh, guy-namic, you know, this, uh, this  phenomenon of bros or, or what I would call guy-amese twins who are constantly attached  and kind of, are attached to a liver. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, gosh.  It's all guy talk.  They were always, uh, you know, drinking together and, and go everywhere together.  So, you know, I thought it would be cool to make up a, a kind of vocabulary for them  that they could use when they're bro-ing down.  Right.  Bro, bro-down.  What's a, when you're bro-ing down?  Well, when you're bro-ing it up, when you're, when you're with your bros and drinking and,  you know, at the strip club, that sort of thing.  I think you got a hit on your, uh, hands here, Daniel.  Well, I, I, I couldn't get past the 10 bro-manments.  It's like commandments, but for bros.  Exactly. 
[02:22:00]  Number one, I am your bro.  Thou shalt not put hoes before me.  Ah, bros before hoes has been something that's been said for a long time.  That's true.  That's, yeah, yeah.  Number two.  I actually have a spin on that, though.  I mean, it is, obviously that's kind of, you know, that's kind of unreasonable.  That's not going to happen in real life.  And it's okay to ditch for a bitch.  Ah.  As long as you, as long as you have a gallaby.  And a gallaby is just.  A gallaby.  What's a gallaby?  Is that like, what is that?  It's like an alibi for not, an explanation for why you weren't with your bros. 
[02:22:30]  And it should never be romantic.  It should never be chivalrous.  You know, it shouldn't be about getting a girl flowers.  It should be about deflowering a girl.  Right.  That is, um, that is a proper gallaby.  Nice.  And your bros should understand that.  You know, the bros before hoes can go out the window if you've got a good, uh, a gallaby.  Exactly.  All right.  I'd just like to understand.  But, um, yeah, you know, other, other, uh, more from the Ten Bro Mamets. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, you, you should, um, you should, uh, remember the Sabbath day, you know, to keep  it wholly devoted to watching football.  Um, you know, you should honor your mother and father, obviously.  No mother jokes.  Why?  Mother jokes can be fun, no?  I don't know.  I think they're a little played out.  And that's kind of the idea, you know, behind the book, that these words are a little played  out.  We need new words, you know.  Mm.  Uh, we've had, uh, we've had the same kind of wingman terminology for a long time now. 
[02:23:30]  So it's time to kind of...  Well, speaking of, uh, men needing, uh, needing new words, let's go through, uh, some of, uh,  some of your vocabulary here.  Sure thing.  Uh, which ones, uh, would you like to do?  Well, how about you hit us up with a word?  You know, let's talk about the old words and the new ones.  I mean, uh, we've had fugly for so long.  Why not come up with new ugly words such as, uh, tugly, which is, you know, when a girl  is so ugly, you'd rather just go home and tug it than hooking up with it. 
[02:24:00]  Ah.  Oh my God.  Or, uh, you know.  I gotta tell you, uh, Daniel, we got a live audience today and, uh, they're definitely enjoying  this.  They're, they're, they're, uh, ugly.  Yeah, man!  You like, uh, like Daniel so far?  Very good.  All right.  Tugly.  I like that.  Well, what about wasted?  I mean, you know, we've been using this word to describe a state of inebriation for so  long.  Uh, you know, what about.  We use it as time on this radio show.  What's that?  Now.  What's that?  I said sometimes we use it as like time on this radio show is wasted. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, good gravy.  We use more specific words like slam decapped.  That's when you're so slammed that you can't even like get your car keys out of your, uh,  out of your pocket.  You need your bro to do it for you.  I heard that.  Oh God.  Do you really want your bro going into your pockets though?  Yes.  You know, you're back to bromo again.  Good gosh.  I gotta make a call.  All right.  When you're transvest tanked, you're so tanked that you don't care whether the hooker you  just picked up is a man or a woman.  Yeah.  Transvest tanked.  Some people don't need to be drunk to do that. 
[02:25:00]  Jimmy would be able to talk about that.  Yeah.  He's got business today.  He's a very busy man, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I wish, uh, yeah, there was a word for, for, for that.  What is, uh, what is, I'm going through the brocabulary, Daniel.  What's this, uh, master date all about?  Master date, of course, is a, uh, a date, but instead of taking a girl, you're taking yourself  out of your pants.  It's, uh, it's, uh, it's kind of a masturbation session that's planned in advance.  Like, let's say your girl is going out on a Friday night and you, you know, that you're 
[02:25:30]  going to have a half an hour to yourself to kind of, you know, treat yourself to dinner  and a movie, dinner and a movie, of course, being a porno and some nachos.  Very good.  There's a whole actual chapter of Spank speak, which I'm really proud of.  Oh, Spank speak.  Oh, Spank.  Well, where's that?  I want to play along here.  That's towards the end of the book, right?  And they are, uh, shitter chatter.  Shitter chatter, sure.  And Spank speak is actually, uh, you know, like a masturbation, you know, when you're, 
[02:26:00]  uh, masturbating while smashed, which can often, uh, lead to a jack out, which is when  you black out while you're jacking off.  A jack out.  That's kind of funny.  Oh, my God.  That was, uh, jacking this weekend, weren't you?  Oh, my God.  I was so hammered.  I was, uh, yeah.  I passed out.  Right.  Dick in hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't mine.  You know, I'm confused, I'm confused with, uh, tear jerking.  Tear jerking is, uh, you know, let's say you break up with a girlfriend, but you still 
[02:26:30]  have some holaroids of her, uh, lying around.  Uh-huh.  What's a, wait, what's a hol-der-oid?  A hol-der-oid is just a polaroid of a hoe that you, uh, went out with.  A hol-der-oid.  Oh, all right.  I gotcha.  Oh, God.  I get that.  Some of these are kind of painful.  Um, but, yeah, tear jerking is when you, when you whip those out and, and you're kind  of, um, you know, jerking it to what I would call mornography, which is pornography of, you  know, a girl that you're still mourning the loss of.  Ah. 
[02:27:00]  It's a dark, dark place to be.  Yeah.  Well, uh, let's, uh, go to the phones and say hi to Steve.  Hi, Steve.  Hello.  You're on with, uh, Daniel.  Steve.  Hi, Daniel.  How are you?  Hey, Steve.  How's it going?  Is your book available in stores now?  I actually like the bro-munications and things of that nature.  Um, yeah, it is.  What exactly?  It's on Amazon also.  Oh, go ahead.  You talk.  I'll buy it on the net.  What, what actually, what, uh, inspired you to, to do this? 
[02:27:30]  I think they asked that question, right?  I don't, I don't know.  I was listening.  I was on hold.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Steve.  We, uh, we already asked him, uh, that question, Steve.  Yeah, for some reason, when, uh, our listeners are on hold, Daniel, they don't get to hear  the show.  So maybe, maybe you could humor, uh, Steve and just tell him real fast.  Well, is it because, like, is this something, are these words that people are actually using?  Like, did you create a lot of them?  Um, what happened?  Go.  Yeah, I did create, um, most of them, and the idea is to basically...  What is your favorite one?  I liked the, the, the, uh, the, the Holaroid and the other, one of the, the masturbation 
[02:28:00]  when the man passes out.  What is your favorite?  I like, uh, Horrensic Evidence.  Ramone!  Tell this bag of shit to stop doing puns!  Ramone!  I'd rather give a bro job than listen to this shit stain!  That's pretty good.  Ramone!  I hope this man dies of AIDS!  I wasn't expecting that. 
[02:28:30]  Ramone!  He's ugly!  He's ugly and he sucks!  Ramone!  Ramone!  I've read funnier leaflets at the DMV!  Tell me when you're done.  I'm just checking my email.  Okay.  All right.  I've read it temporarily.  What?  All right.  Let's thank you, Steve.  Yeah, sometimes, uh, yeah, sometimes these, uh, the callers slip through.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  I like that, though.  Tell me when you're done.  I'm checking my email.  Yeah, well...  Oh, wow.  Uh, Daniel?  Yeah.  So, where were we...  Oh, uh, the Punxsutawney Jill.  That was the one that, uh, piqued our interest when we, uh, were going through this.  Uh, Punxsutawney Jill is, you know...  What page is that on?  Hmm.  I'm trying to find it.  Wait a minute.  Do you know, uh, where that...  Oh, I got it.  Wow, what a coincidence.  I just turned right to it.  What page, Ant?  Uh, it's a 143.  143.  Okay.  You know, what's that one about?  That one is, um, you know, when spring comes around and, uh, you know, a girl starts wearing 
[02:29:30]  a kind of, you know, the first day of nice weather when she starts wearing a miniskirt  and by the end of the night, you know, she's shivering because, uh, the weather has changed.  She comes out like a groundhog, but, uh...  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  Did you do a lot of these...  Are these all, like, have you had...  Do you have contributions, or are these all you?  Uh, they're pretty much all me.  I mean, um, there were people who chipped in a bit.  Uh, my brother, actually, was, was pretty good.  He's the one who came up with, uh, forensic evidence, which is when you wake up and your 
[02:30:00]  apartment looks like a crime scene because there's panties strewn all over the place,  bras, you know, there's evidence that you were a horn the night before.  What do you call your brother?  That would be a hard thing to come up with.  Yeah.  Bro, bro?  He's my true bro.  He's my, uh, flesh and blood.  Yeah, but I mean, like, what do you call...  Your brother and bro speak like that in, uh, bro-cabulary?  You know, the bro of all bros.  Just a bro, yeah.  Hey, has anyone ever told you that you sound exactly like Kevin Smith? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, my God, he does.  The voice, actually, is very similar.  Yeah.  Do you know that?  I didn't know that, no.  Jesus.  Oh, wow, now that's creeping me out.  Yeah.  Wow.  I like this.  You got a whole thing here.  It's like a...  I like the, uh...  It's hard...  It's like activity she wants to butt in on, why you aren't having it, and your excuse.  Like, activity she wants to butt in on, watching the game, which everyone's had to deal with.  You're trying to watch the game, and she's going to put her face in there.  Why you aren't having it. 
[02:31:00]  Because she'll be like an annoying two-year-old asking,  Daddy, what's a touchdown?  What's a fumble?  What's a pigskin?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  And your excuse is, you're superstitious.  For 20 years, you haven't let anyone whose first name starts with whatever her initial is  watch the game with you, because it jinxes the team.  Yeah.  This includes your mom.  Sorry, babe, I know it's crazy, but that's just the way it is.  But when my team wins, I'll buy you a milkshake.  For the woman or for the kid?  That's an example of a Jersey girl, which is a girl who doesn't really follow football. 
[02:31:30]  She just wears the jersey just to kind of bro along with her boyfriend.  Ah.  Oh, I like that, because I was just at a hockey game.  And you see those chicks.  Yeah.  They're irritating.  They're just like the quarterback, you know.  They're the ones who love...  Well, that's why they came up with the pink version of the jersey, so the chicks could wear  the pink version.  Yeah, and the hats and all that shit.  What's a manti?  Mantis are panties that you would wear after hooking up with a girl when you don't have 
[02:32:00]  fresh, tighty-whities at your disposal.  And that's an example of a word that, you know, I kind of made it a mix of things that  guys actually do and that guys would never do in a million years, not sober anyway.  Yeah.  Just to kind of keep the girls guessing.  You know, women who read the book, I think their reaction a lot of the times is, do guys  actually do this stuff.  Right.  And, you know, they need to kind of figure that out with their boyfriend. 
[02:32:30]  How come you have guy dolls?  Acceptable guy dolls and false guy dolls?  Those are guy dolls.  Oh.  Guy dolls with a guy.  Oh, I see.  I get it.  What does that mean?  You know, guys that you look up to.  You're heroes, you know.  Like Brad Pitt and stuff?  Like Chuck Norris, you know.  Well, acceptable, you kind of compare and contrast.  Hockey players are acceptable.  Mm-hmm.  Ice skaters are not.  Yeah.  Hard drinkers like Bukowski are acceptable. 
[02:33:00]  Sure.  Deep thinkers like Plato are not.  Um.  Scott Peterson's acceptable.  Mm-hmm.  Nice husbands are not.  Mm-hmm.  Jake Lamont's way of problem solving is acceptable.  Talking things out or not.  Do you know any lines from, like, do you know any, like, Silent Bob lines?  You're asking me?  Yeah.  No.  Is this Kevin Smith?  No, he does sound like Kevin, but it's not Kevin. 
[02:33:30]  How do you know?  Okay, I'm reading this.  It's not Kevin.  No one else has told you you sound just like Kevin Smith?  I've never heard that, no.  Are you doing, like, a Seinfeld when Seinfeld, like, put out a book, but it wasn't under Seinfeld?  Seinfeld's name, but then everyone found out it was Seinfeld.  Did he really do that, like, Stephen King with Richard Bachman?  Yeah, a little of that, right.  How long did it take you to actually, uh, to write this?  Uh, it's hard to say.  It didn't take, um, you know, it took about a year. 
[02:34:00]  That's it?  Wow.  It took about a year.  There was a lot of, uh, procrastination involved.  Ah, ha, ha.  But, um.  Ah, crap.  Which, now it's procrastination.  It's obviously a little more wordplay, but.  That's very clever, because a lot of us, we have things to do, but we end up spending  time jerking off instead.  Procrastination.  It's fucking mind-boggling.  Right.  Jimmy can relate to that.  I can.  What's a, what's a dudonym?  A dudonym is, um, you know, like McLovin.  It's your pseudonym that refers, you know, guys never call each other by their real names,  so, you know.  No? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that's true.  You gotta have a dudonym.  You also have a brudonym, like, uh.  What's your dudonym?  With Abraham Drinkin, who makes a, uh, an ebriation proclamation.  Ah.  Uh, four horrors.  Better than the real one.  Yeah, exactly.  What is your, uh, what is your dudonym?  Um, I go by, uh, Danimal.  Danimal.  Danimal.  You know, the Danimal.  I also had a career as a competitive eater.  Nice.  And, uh, I was referred to as the fly, because I was on food like a fly.  I, uh, that, uh.  They called me that when a dominator shit in my mouth. 
[02:35:00]  Well, you know, it happens.  Danimal.  Jim, what's your, like, manly name?  What's that?  Do you have, like, a Danimal name?  No, I've actually never, I never had one.  I, I, I, I.  Really?  Yeah, I would love to have, like, a, I mean.  Can you give one to Jim?  Like, can you work off the name Jim?  Is it always off the name, or is it also off behavior?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good question.  It's usually, uh, it's usually off behavior.  That's, the brudonym would be, like, you know, your, your behavior while you're drinking, 
[02:35:30]  you know.  So, uh.  Oh, wow.  If you're, uh.  Jim aside.  You know, you could be, like, Saddam Broussain, or, uh.  I want to be Anthbrony.  That's kind of cool, right?  I could be, like, hey, Anthbrony.  I'm Bagless Jimmy.  Ah, that's a good one.  Yeah, Bagless Jimmy Rolls.  If you're with a name like Jim, I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty manly to begin with.  Yeah.  You spell it G-Y-M.  Your Jims are your.  Jim the shim.  You can only go down from there, like Jimmy, or Joey, or.  Or, uh, like, I, I sometimes I like to go to the Jimmy-nasium. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, Jimmy-nasium would be good for you.  Hey, nice.  Manly.  See, that's why we're not writing the book, and Daniel is.  Our, our stuff is lame compared to this.  Uh, Guyber Nation, we did that one, right?  Guyber Nation is when you shut yourself in.  You, uh, you don't, you know, maybe you've bro-deed, you've over-deed on, you're overdosed  on your bros, and you just kind of, uh, go in and kind of pump your stomach.  Rod Stewart bro-deed.  Robert Reed. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, they all did, sure.  Wow, this is, uh, pretty good stuff.  The, uh, the cup grade, what's that cup grade?  Cup grade is when you're dating, you know, a B cup, and you, uh, cup grade to another.  She turns 15 and.  B cup or a B cup.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, and you get a chick.  I actually like chicks with smaller tits, though.  Yeah.  To be honest with you.  I mean, I guess.  They're much better shaped.  They are.  And, uh, much firmer.  Easier to bite.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you, there's a whole chapter on titty-o-syncrasies. 
[02:37:00]  Titty-o-syncrasies?  Uh, how did we not know?  What page is that on?  You got, um, you got the scariolas, which are areolas.  Scariola.  They're so big, they're scary.  See, I actually like that.  I like a big, I like a big brown one.  Do you?  I want it to look like someone mushed diarrhea on their tits.  Dude, I'm so with you on that one.  What I like are the gripples.  The gripples?  Wow.  What are the gripples?  What are the gripples?  You know?  Oh, I like that.  Oh, yeah.  I like the thing that's gripping. 
[02:37:30]  That's fucking hilarious.  What else about the breast?  Because it's amazing.  Everyone's got different breast taste.  Tidiosyncrasies.  Tidiosyncrasies.  There's also, um, no offense to guys who, uh, who like smaller breasts, but there's also  gang-ups.  You ever hear Olivia Newton gone?  Oh, we're talking about tidiosyncrasies, of course.  Oh, just having some fun.  Good gravy. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, we...  Hello?  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tidiosyncrasies.  Tidiosyncrasies.  We're just trying to come up with our own, just to have some fun with this.  There go the floodgates.  What were you saying about, uh, something, uh, what was the one you said just before that?  Uh, the one, for, uh, a guy who likes a smaller, uh, smaller breast is a gay cup, which  is eight cups that are so small, they make you feel gay.  Ah, there's nothing there, right? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are a little rough.  We're still flat as a plate.  Yeah.  But, uh...  I never, I never, I never thought gay in that, in that case.  I always thought, like, underage.  Well...  You think underage.  Yeah.  Kyle S. from...  Well, Kyle S. from Indiana wants to help you with...  What's the, what's the chapter called?  Tidiosyncrasies?  Yeah.  Kyle S. from Indiana.  Christina Applegon.  Do you have anything about, because I like larger vagus, do you have anything, like, 
[02:39:00]  about clits or anything like that?  Ah, yeah.  Uh, there is, yeah.  Like a clitoris?  There's, like, a clit that belongs on a dinosaurus?  Nice.  That's pretty good, because Jimmy likes the big ones.  He likes the big ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything like, uh...  I like a clit, like an elephant trunk.  There's, like, the clitiot who doesn't know his way around...  Oh, the pussy?  A clitiot.  I like that.  All right.  I like that.  God, you have a million of them.  You have anything...  Yeah, I guess there would be clitiosyncrasies.  Maybe I'll save that for the, uh... 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we're not filming movies.  You should write something about, like, the smell under the hood.  Hey, you got anything on the shitter?  There's an entire chapter of shitter chatter.  Oh, it's called shitter chatter?  Shitter chatter.  Shitter chatter.  Oh, okay.  That sounds too much like shitter chatter.  That's like when you overpopulate the bowl.  When the bowl is, uh, overpopulated...  Oh, when she says she's gonna...  She hasn't taken a suppository, and she has.  The next thing you know, it's all over your chest.  And then you gotta pay her.  Oh, believe me. 
[02:40:00]  She's not even the Russian that was in the ad.  Excuse me, madam.  You put wet hay on my chest.  Ma'am, someone spilled gulags on my chest.  I'm paying for a solid log here.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Excuse me, miss.  I don't want to pay for fucking jerk chicken off my fucking chin and neck. 
[02:40:30]  What about, uh, you got blocabulary.  Now, this is good, because, you know, us guys, we like the, we like the blowjobs, right?  Is that what you do when you're out with your friend, cabulary?  Hey, that can be good.  For the second book, sir.  Uh, what's some of the blocabulary you like?  Blocabulary, um, well, there's the blowjobligation.  When you do a, um, when you do a favor for a girl, you help her move or something, you change  her tire, and she owes you a blowjob.  She's blowjobligated.  Oh, blowjobligated. 
[02:41:00]  That's very clever.  That's great.  Is that like when you drive someone, like, far from home?  And you say, uh, suck it, or you're gonna walk.  Or, or you're gonna end up in a shallow grave.  Exactly.  Not quite.  I wouldn't take it that far.  What's, uh, saving your life with a sucking mist called?  You wanna, you wanna explain, uh, chap's dick?  Uh, chap's dick.  What I like to put in my mouth.  Uh, chap's dick is, uh, chap's dick.  Uncle Paul!  Chap's dick. 
[02:41:30]  That's hilarious.  What's, what's your definition of chap's dick?  Uh, chap's dick is just a dick that you rub on our lips, like chap's dick.  Yep.  It's pretty, pretty straightforward.  Mm-hmm.  I, uh, my favorite in the, in the blowjob, um, you know, uh, chapter is Maxell, when you're,  uh, like the Maxell guy, the Maxell cassette guy who is leaning back in the, uh, a leather  chair.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm right.  How old are you?  Yeah.  What are you getting blown away?  I always thought that, like, when a guy was, what, what, what's the point of that one?  Is, like, that she's queefing on you and your hair's blowing back? 
[02:42:00]  Dude.  Uh, no, that, just that you're in a comfortable chair, you know?  Yo, uh.  In a nice leather chair.  How come the wind's blowing in the man's face?  Because it's a blowjob.  It's like he's listening to music during a tsunami.  Because he's actually getting a blowjob.  Hey, uh, I like your, I, I want to read this, because this is very clever.  Eating disorder is, uh, an eating disorder that's specific to cockaholics.  Yeah.  I've never seen someone with such an eating disorder.  She was a total penis fly trap. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, they like that one.  Did you reread this and go back over and find ones you missed?  Like, if you would write one, would you go back over and, like, have somebody reread it and go,  well, look, you could change this word, you could change that word?  Like, how many passes through did you do?  Yeah.  Seriously.  Yeah, I did, I did, uh, you know, with, you know, with any manuscript, you reread it, you add some more words.  It did get very pun-heavy, which is why it might be described as pun-ish-ment.  Oh, nice.  You know, there's no, there's no avoiding puns if you're, if you're doing guy talk. 
[02:43:00]  You know, that's a crucial, crucial element.  That's true.  You got a lot of it, man.  I like, I like, why would, why would bros, why would bros care about a boomer wang?  Oh, that's gone.  You've never, I mean, you've never watched porn and seen a dick that was exactly like you.  You're, well, that's a doppel wanger.  The boomer wang is like, that's in, I think that's in the, um, the, uh, you know, spank speak chapter.  It's just a, uh, a curved penis. 
[02:43:30]  It's just, you know, there needs to be a word for it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Um, I like this one, catheter.  Yeah, we're all going through the book.  Cranes are worse than a pain in the ass, they're a pain in the dick.  Yeah.  Uh.  You could also call them penile cancer.  Mm-hmm.  Wait, does crack-tivities?  What's crack-tivities?  Crack-tivities, just any activities related to, uh, the smoking of crack or, you know.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Other sorts of cracks.  Yeah.  Uh.  What's a give yourself a grinspection?  That's, uh, when you have a bang-over.  Uh, bang-over is when you, uh, wake up after a night of excessive banging and you want to  make sure that you're, uh, you know, not too obvious when you roll into the office.  You want to, you know, uh, give yourself a grinspection, make sure there's no short and  curlies in your, uh, in your teeth.  Wow.  That never happens to me.  They don't have hair yet. 
[02:44:30]  Gotta give you a dick one, make sure the braces haven't torn it.  And by those, I mean the ones on our legs.  I love a polio kid.  Yeah.  What are they gonna do?  It's a good day for him.  Hey, uh, a girl on a whore path, what's that all about?  Uh.  Um.  What's a whore path?  You know, she's on the whore path, but.  Oh, war whore.  Oh, I get it.  Yeah.  All right.  I think that's an example of, uh, when you're having a retargument, which is a retarded  argument with your girlfriend.  Ah.  Well.  Isn't that anything? 
[02:45:00]  Yes.  Or a discussion with a retard.  Which is always fun.  Don't put your tongue in there.  What's a bathlete?  A bathlete is a, you know, that would replace the word metrosexual, which is kind of tired,  but a bathlete is just someone who's an athlete about bathing, grooming, you know, just  three men around bathhouses.  A bathlete's a guy who can, who can, uh, go from bench to bench in the bathhouse and  fucking drink out of mules. 
[02:45:30]  We got it, Jim.  This, uh, this book is, uh, this book is, uh, this book is, uh, this always goes there.  And, uh, Christina Apple-less.  Shit got no apples.  Sorry, sir.  We just, we, we laugh at ourselves a lot. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  The book really should be more of like a Wikipedia thing where people can, uh, can tweak entries  and, and, uh, kind of make their own.  Um, yeah.  You got a, you got a website, do you?  Drill pill.  What's it, no, it's a drill pill.  Yeah.  That's probably like Viagra or something, right?  It's like Viagra.  Oh, see, I went with Flintstones Chewable.  If you're about to commit Viagra-vated assault, uh, you definitely, oh, Viagra-vated assault.  That's kind of like aggravated assault, but with your dick out in a hammer.  Right. 
[02:46:30]  Are you, uh, planning on selling a lot of these?  That's the plan, yeah.  Have you got out and done book signings and stuff like that?  Um, not yet, no.  I have, um, I have put my, uh, blot-o-graph on a lot of them, which is when you, uh, you  sign your credit card when you're totally wasted.  What's it called?  A lot of graph.  Why the blot, though?  Well, you're blot, though.  You're totally blot.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.  What is this, a shot glass put?  Shot glass put is, um, there's advice on when you get into a Neander brawl in a bar, when 
[02:47:00]  a bar-gument turns into a Neander brawl, and, uh, you're going to want to use, like,  the Q-E-Ville slugger, like the, uh, pool cue that you, uh, slug someone over the head  with.  Shot glass put is, you know, you take a shot glass and heave it like a shot put across  the room at someone.  Do you?  Um, so there's a lot of brawl, uh, bar brawl advice.  What is the, um, what?  What's Flack Friday?  Yeah.  Flack Friday is, you know.  It's amazing, by the way.  You actually remember all these offhand. 
[02:47:30]  I know.  It's amazing.  Um, yeah, I'm kind of amazed myself.  It's like you don't have a job or something.  Flack Friday is, like, Friday rolls around, your girl wants to be with you, you want to  be with your boys, you're going to get flack from someone no matter what you do, whether  you see the chick flick with her or you see the dick flick with them, you know, someone  is going to be pissed off at you.  Wait, chick flick with her or a dick flick with them?  Yeah, she wants to go out and see the new, like, you know, Tyler Perry movie or something.  And your guys want to go out and see the new Die Hard movie, you know, you're damned if 
[02:48:00]  you, uh, dude, you're damned if you do, and you're in 1985 if you're, like, that's if  you're in a bad relationship.  So, um, how long was it, how long was it till your, uh, bros told you, all right, enough  with the fucking puns?  Yeah.  I'm wondering when you're going to tell me that.  No.  Oh.  Yeah.  They, uh, they, um.  Brian from St. Louis, Melissa Lessridge. 
[02:48:30]  I don't know why.  It's definitely to be taken in small doses.  Keep it by the toilet, read it, you know, one entry at a time.  Yeah.  Run out of toilet paper.  That's true.  Shitterature.  That's, uh, the book you put by the ball, right?  217 pieces of, um, where, where are you actually, are you a New Yorker?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  What do you say, keep it by the what? 
[02:49:00]  And I forgot.  What do you say, keep it by the shitter?  Oh.  Or the, um.  Woo!  Holy shit. 
[02:49:30]  Wait for it. 
[02:50:00]  What the fuck?  All right, Ogre.  Oh, no.  Wait for it.  Of course. 
[02:50:30]  I've never seen anybody.  He says, would you have for breakfast a sponge?  Wow.  Oh, God.  Maybe that's got to be changed.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay, so it's vocabulary.  Is he gone? 
[02:51:00]  It's known as the urinal book.  No.  Still hanging.  Sorry for the interruption.  No problem.  Oh.  Ew.  I've never seen anybody go that long.  It's amazing. 
[02:51:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So.  What's a slurchous?  Slurchous is, uh, you know, when you're at the bar, you're making, uh...  Oh, God.  Don't wait.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Hello.  This is Cloris Leachman.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:52:00]  It's the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am Iraq.  He is Sam.  Sam, after the break, your favorite show, Lost.  Emily DeRaven is in studio.  Yes, I always say we need more people from Lost in studio, because I watch the show all  the time.  It's Emily DeRaven.  Who does she play on the show, without looking at the paper?  Um, well, we'll talk about that when we get back on The Worst of Opie and Anthony  Show.  These things are very, uh, timed, so we don't, we can't banter like that.  Her name is Claire.  No, I know, I know.  Oh. 
[02:52:30]  I just knew I knew.  Okay.  Anthony, I am Sam, and he is Iraq.  That's incorrect.  Really?  How dare you?  I wrote it wrong, then.  I am Iraq, and you're Sam.  Yeah, how dare you try to get famous off my name.  I'm not.  I think it was just a simple typo.  I don't think so.  I don't want to be Sam anyway.  So, it's The Worst of Opie and Anthony, and, um, you know, some of our staff are huge Lost  fans.  I know you're not.  I am.  I am a big Lost fan.  You're really?  Yeah.  Since when?  I've been, uh, I've been on board since season one.  Wow.  What'd you think of the, uh, the last episode?  Uh, it was a while ago, but it was, uh, surprising. 
[02:53:00]  Okay.  Uh, some, some twists and turns that I did not see coming, but then, uh, some things that I  would have changed as well.  What do you think about Jacob?  Yeah, you never know about Jacob.  That's the whole thing.  I know.  It's puzzling, right?  It is.  Anyway, we have Emily DeRaven in.  She plays Claire.  Claire.  Which, uh, everybody loves to say her name in the Australian accent.  I know.  Her being from Australia.  Claire.  And, uh...  Yeah, like Lost.  Anthony seems a bit smitten.  Well, we're all Lost fans, and when a pretty blonde who's on Lost comes into studio, you're 
[02:53:30]  gonna get smitten.  Fill in the blank, Sam.  Blank initiative.  Right here.  On the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Blank initiative.  Yes, that's a little teaser, I guess.  No.  No.  You're listening to the worst.  It sucks a pile of cock.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ah, shit.  All right.  What do you got, Jimmy?  We have to bring our guest in.  Uh, I wonder, if I say her name wrong, she can smash me in the head when she comes in.  I'm very happy.  Well, she should anyway.  Uh, I'm gonna lead you, Raven, from, uh, from Lost, of course. 
[02:54:00]  She's Claire on Lost.  She's one of the stars of one of the biggest shows on television.  Oh, Emile's here?  Emile D...  Emile, what?  Emile D...  Raven.  Watch that be right.  Hi.  Emile D.  Raven.  Could you straighten him out on your name, please?  No, I got it.  First, take a seat.  Welcome.  Is that right?  Okay.  No, it's Emile.  Look.  It says it right there.  Emile.  No, it's...  It's the French spelling.  I'm sorry.  Wow, you're beautiful.  My God.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  You don't really...  Do you watch Lost?  She's one of the big stars on Lost.  Yes.  I have not seen an episode of Lost. 
[02:54:30]  I have not missed an episode.  So, Hugh...  He's in the minority because...  Oh, I know I'm in the minority.  And I'm stupid.  I know I should be watching Lost.  I just haven't...  I got a box set that I got for Christmas, and one of my brothers grabbed it, and I can't  get it back from him.  And then I DVR.  I DVR it sometimes, and then stupid Than, who watches it all the time, goes, hey, did you  watch Lost last night?  I go, no, shut up!  And then he'll start going, oh, probably best episode ever.  Best episode ever. 
[02:55:00]  And then I sit there and get very annoyed at them.  But I watched last Thursday's episode last night, and I was a little worried about you.  Were you?  With your little legs sticking out from under the wreckage.  But I came through.  It's okay.  Yeah, actually, there was an exploded house you're in, and you just needed a...  It was a big explosion.  You just needed a Band-Aid.  Right.  How big was the explosion you were in?  Oh, boy, Jimmy.  What's wrong?  It was a huge explosion?  Yeah, the whole house was... 
[02:55:30]  The whole house is gone.  The whole house?  Jimmy, you hear that?  The whole house?  I've seen every episode, and I saw half of that one.  I downloaded it off iTunes while I was on the road, and I got through half of it, and  then my flight had to leave.  She's fine.  Don't worry.  I would assume that they wouldn't have a dead person promoting.  That'd be kind of silly.  Well, for the flash-forwards, perhaps.  But some dead people have been on the show, which is...  You know something?  They could kill you off on this show, and you're still on the show.  You're still on the show.  I know.  That's hysterical.  People die, and they don't even care.  It's like, oh, I'm dead. 
[02:56:00]  They can do anything they want.  The artistic license they have is incredible.  Michael was in season one, and then all of a sudden he was gone.  My theory is it was because the kid, Walt, probably grew too fast, and the problem is  when you have a 10 or 11-year-old, it takes two years to film.  All of a sudden, he's 51.  You can't replace him easily.  Enough with Walt.  I hate the idea that everybody had to suffer because of stupid Walt.  Why?  Because?  Who cares?  He's a kid.  Oh, I liked Walt. 
[02:56:30]  No, you didn't.  Uh-oh.  Am I supposed to like Walt?  He walks a good boy.  He's a good boy.  How many babies have you been through?  Malcolm, he's such a nice kid.  How many?  Because you have a baby on the show.  How many different kids have they used before they get big?  Oh, I've lost count, but they're all really sweet.  Do you attach them, or are you just kind of overpicking them?  Yeah, sometimes.  I mean, sometimes you use...  You know, if I'm in an episode for one day at work, that's sometimes the only time you'll use  that baby, but sometimes if it's, you know, two episodes back-to-back that you're in a lot,  you'll get to know them.  Really?  It's like only one baby per episode? 
[02:57:00]  No, they'll last a couple of months if they're good.  A lot of them, you know, don't enjoy being held by other people.  Yeah.  What is their mommy like right next to you and stuff to try to keep them quiet?  Oh, yeah, with the little toys.  Yeah.  Okay, make mommy some money.  How far in advance do you know what's going on?  I know the writing is so all over the place, and it's brilliant.  How much in advance do you know?  You know, we get scripts about a week to two weeks before we shoot. 
[02:57:30]  So that's all I know.  Oh, cool.  So what's going to happen?  Come on.  And we're shooting right now, like, we've got about two, three weeks left.  Yeah.  And then we're done.  So there's like a two, three-part finale.  Yeah, they cut out a couple episodes, huh, because of the strike to catch up, I guess?  Yeah, we were meant to do 16.  We're very bummed out about that, got to be honest.  Yeah.  Well, the thing is, film some other stuff for the box set. 
[02:58:00]  Film some filler stuff for us.  Mobisodes.  Yeah, we need it.  If they're still shooting, like, they don't shoot the whole season, and then just, like,  I thought it was like The Sopranos or The Wire or something, where they shot the entire season.  They actually just kind of shoot as they go.  What do you mean?  Like, you guys don't have the last three episodes of the season shot already.  No, not yet, no.  Oh, I'm surprised.  I thought they shot the whole season.  What a dope audience.  You're secretive.  Okay, I guess spoilers and stuff would leak out.  Wait, so you have to go back to Hawaii?  Yeah, I think I've only got one more day of work.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, that means she's done.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, that was a spoiler.  Oh, the internet's going to be a chatty.  It's going to be a buzz.  Are you surprised about, like...  Maybe more.  I don't know, actually.  Oh, maybe more.  That's good.  Too late.  Too late.  No, I haven't read the last script.  Oh, okay.  You don't know.  Yeah.  But you heard it here one day.  That's right.  Are you surprised at the amount of internet speculating and sites, and do you read any of that stuff?  Not really.  I kind of used to be...  I mean, we all used to speculate and ask these questions of what's going on and what's going 
[02:59:00]  to happen and where are we, why are we here, and we all kind of gave up a while ago.  Because they'd never tell you the truth.  They'd be like, no, that's not it.  No.  Have you ever read somebody's speculation, though?  Because sometimes we'll go on websites, you know, fan sites, and read some speculation  as to what people think is going to happen, and then you go like, wow, that makes perfect  sense.  This guy figured it out.  And then the next episode, you go, that guy was an ass who knew nothing.  I haven't read any that I really thought that's it. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, you know, the whole purgatory thing was a big thing for a long time.  Yeah, I think everyone's trying to figure out the big picture.  Like, there's this one big answer to the whole thing, and I just see it as a bunch of little  stuff going on that, you know, I'm kind of one of those, enjoy the journey instead of  the destination kind of guy.  What interests me is the whole island being able to move.  Yeah.  That's just crazy.  Yeah, that's a little odd.  That's just, okay.  What do you mean?  Yeah, I don't know what you mean.  Well, like, you know, no one could kind of find it again. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, it sort of oscillates around.  It's not just in one area.  Yeah.  It's like a big boat.  Yeah, it's like a giant boat or something.  And then it's got some power over people.  And the whole time travel thing is very confusing.  It's in a different time period sometimes.  And then it kept, like, what happened when, what's his name there, Michael wanted to, you  know, off himself.  And the island doesn't want him to.  Right.  So it does what it has to do to prevent him from doing that. 
[03:00:30]  And they make bad guys, good guys all the time.  Like, in season one, the others, you couldn't picture what the others were.  They must have been these monsters.  Horrible people.  And then you realize, no, they're just more victims.  And the doctor, Ethan, who, oh, my God, this guy's awful.  He's a murderer.  Oh, no, he was just trying to save babies.  Yeah.  Who don't like anymore?  Zan pointed out, Ethan has more time post-mortem than he did live on the show.  Yeah, for sure.  He really did.  He's killed off more time, more screen time.  It's like, how many times can you die?  Yeah.  Apparently a few. 
[03:01:00]  What's the biggest shock you've had?  Like, I mean, I know you guys probably see certain things coming, but of all the things  they've done on the show, what's one or two of the biggest ones that made you kind of  really, you couldn't believe they actually went in that direction?  Well, good or bad?  For me, one of the big things was Dom dying, because I personally worked with him so much.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, not Dom dying.  Charlie dying.  Yeah.  Dom's fine.  When she said Dom, I didn't want to be stupid and go, who's Dom?  Because I didn't want her to think I don't watch the show?  Oh, Charlie, okay. 
[03:01:30]  Just because, you know, you work with someone so much, and that's your work.  You go to work, and you go work with this person, and suddenly that's just, poof.  And then he's gone.  But then he pops up every so often.  Yeah, exactly.  So everybody's still kind of hanging around.  You were in The Hills Have Eyes.  Yes.  Which, it was kind of cool, because I didn't see that until after I saw A Lot of Lost.  I'm sitting there going, who is that girl?  Oh, yeah.  Pretty nice there when you're sunning in the little lounge chair, I must say. 
[03:02:00]  But, uh, you...  I didn't see any part you remember.  Well, no.  That movie was horrific.  Yeah, it really was.  But really graphically gruesome.  Cool movie.  But one of my favorites in that, what's his name from, um...  From, uh...  God damn it, why can't I remember now?  Would you...  Oh, Ted Levine.  Yeah, Ted.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  He has a line in there that is so funny, and it's just one word. 
[03:02:30]  When, uh, the one, the one, uh, guy asks, well, can you fix it?  When the truck wrecks, and he just turns around and goes, what?  And that voice is, what?  What?  Oh, we have that clip?  Yeah, I made them get it for me.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Can she hear it?  I don't know.  Can you hear that?  What?  Yeah.  I can hear it out there.  Yeah, she's got it.  Yeah, that guy is hysterical.  Like, everything he's in, I just...  Yeah, he's a great actor.  ...picture the tuck dance that he did.  Yeah, he's a cast on that movie. 
[03:03:00]  It was fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very gruesome, though, man.  I mean...  Whoa.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I was just saying, like, it says here on the thing, you got married to a...  It's off the subject, to an actor for...  And you were divorced less than six months later.  No, we never got divorced.  Oh, you didn't?  No.  Okay, well...  Incorrect information.  Well, here's...  This is exactly...  We're happy and married.  You know something, then?  Kill somebody.  This is what it says.  No one needs to die.  She got married to actor Josh Janowitz in June of 2007 and was divorced within six months. 
[03:03:30]  What are you, giving a deposition?  You can't read these things you read.  No, but who made up the prep sheet?  Sam.  Bring them all right now.  Bring Sam.  Bring Sam in here right now.  Sam dies.  Are you still happily married?  Yes.  Okay, good.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Do you wonder why we're languishing in mediocrity as a show?  It's because we have guys that are going to a, I don't know, a blog to get information?  I want to see where they...  I want to see where Sam went for this.  It doesn't matter where it is.  It's just, it's, there's so much stuff out there that's written.  But that sounds interesting.  Like, if you got married and divorced within six months, like, there's probably a story  there.  But, like, we got married. 
[03:04:00]  No, it's terrific.  We're still married.  There's really no story there.  So I probably wouldn't have hit on that talking point.  It really is.  Nobody wants to hear about happily married people.  Hey, as we get, as we get Sam in here.  Oh, here he is.  Okay.  I'm so sorry to be happy.  Sam, where did we get that info that she was married and divorced within six months?  Just so you made it up.  It was on, uh...  Online encyclopedia.  Wikipedia.  Wikipedia.  Wikipedia.  Yeah.  She's laughing at you.  Do you know anyone can sign on there and just put whatever they want in there? 
[03:04:30]  She's just laughing at you.  Wikipedia.  There was a rumor.  And it was a rumor?  No.  Is this under the rumor section?  Holy Jesus.  You are the worst.  No one checked it.  Wait, let me make sure now.  Were you in Roswell and Beastmaster before I make a bigger ass out of myself?  True.  Are you on Lost?  All right.  Roswell, though, you came on...  Wait, you came to become an actress, and then you landed that gig pretty quickly? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, I actually moved out because of Roswell.  I came out for an audition for that and then pilot season in general.  What were you doing before that, though, to like...  Were you doing anything in acting before that?  Yeah.  For a year, I did a show called Beastmaster, which was my first job at Harlem in Queensland.  And from that, then I got a call to just audition for Roswell.  I think they thought I lived in L.A. or something.  Oh.  So I thought, oh, yeah, I'll come out for pilot season, and that was the one that worked out. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty sweet.  We've got to get into our movie, but first, we've got Jay Moore on the line.  Can you put the headphones close to your ear so you can hear him?  Jay Moore, everyone.  What's up, Jay?  I have a question for Emily.  Okay.  Emily, are there something with a dress?  You had a dress?  You were in a...  You were in a dress?  You were in a dress?  Something with a dress?  What?  Say what?  You were in a mall where there was some crazy story.  Somebody told me from WFAN that you were in a dress? 
[03:06:00]  I have been known to wear dresses, yes.  No, you went to a mall where it was crazy.  Just crazy in a dress?  Jay, we have to say...  I'm kind of confused.  Thank you, Jay Moore.  I'll explain that.  That's Jay Moore, our friend, and he's making fun of me.  You know what?  Fine actor, Jay Moore.  Jay starred a new bit, though.  I think every celebrity that comes in, we've got to do that exact rant.  What?  I'm like, tell the truth, though.  You were some crazy story.  Eddie Trump told me from any W that you were in a dress?  Eddie Trump.  Yes, I can confirm that that story is true. 
[03:06:30]  I knew it.  Sammy!  All right, Jay Moore.  Jay is making fun of me because I interviewed a guitarist named Zach Wilde once and just...  I repeated the word dress many times.  It was probably amongst one of the worst interviews ever because he wouldn't shut up about this  dress question.  I was very nervous talking to this guy, and it was just really...  And it was him talking really fast, going, there was a story about a dress, you in a  dress, in the mall with a dress, and a dress...  And I guess that's what Jay was parodying.  Yeah.  That makes so much more sense now.  Now it makes more sense than just somebody blurting out the word dress to you. 
[03:07:00]  I know.  So Emily's film, Ball Don't Lie, premiered Saturday, this past Saturday at Tribeca.  What's the movie about?  It's a very gritty story of this boy Sticky and his growing up.  He's a basketball player.  He's amazing.  And it's, you know, it's everything from his growing up through foster homes to his present  day life and, you know, struggles and love life and all that kind of stuff. 
[03:07:30]  He's got an OCD, too, I noticed.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  But what kind of OCD does he have in the movie?  You know, just repeatedly doing things.  Washing hands and all that, right?  Yeah, that kind of stuff.  And then it goes away when he's on the court.  And what is your character?  My character plays his mother back when he was a child.  Oh, okay.  We're looking at you like, what?  Like, what, are you playing mothers already?  How the hell does that happen?  I always have kids or I'm pregnant or something.  It's really strange.  But, no, her character's a baby and she's got a lot going on. 
[03:08:00]  She's a prostitute.  She's got bipolar disorder.  Just trying to kind of, you know, give her boy a good life and not bring him into her  crap too much.  But that kind of happens anyway.  You play a prostitute with bipolar?  I do.  Fantastic.  Jimmy's in love.  Wonderful.  Both qualities I look for when I meet someone.  Oh, dear.  As an actor, like, I guess you want to do something totally different than what you play on. 
[03:08:30]  I mean, everyone knows you're from Lost and it's Claire, so you probably want to just do  totally different projects, right?  Yeah, whenever, yeah.  It's, that's what I strive for is just to challenge myself to as much as I can with different  characters.  Is there any nudity in this?  No.  That's good.  I prefer it.  I don't go for that.  Sorry.  I prefer that.  I don't go for that.  Thank God.  Well, you think prostitute may be a little nudity, right?  You never know.  You never know.  How'd you get around that?  It just, it just wasn't, you know, my stuff's with the kids, so that would be a little weird.  Oh, yeah.  Is it an R or a PG?  True.  Good point. 
[03:09:00]  Do you curse in it?  Do I?  No.  I don't think I do, actually.  Because she plays such a nice person on a lot.  You want to see sometimes people that you see on TV just being very pleasant, just cursing  a little bit in a movie.  They also have eyes.  You're a little, you know, bitchy.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  Fun to watch.  Let's say hi to Josh in Dallas.  Josh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Emily, I have a question.  In The Hills Have Eyes, there's a really intense scene where it looks like you're being raped  by one of those mutant guys. 
[03:09:30]  And me and my friend have this ongoing debate on whether or not you were actually raped.  What is your feelings on that?  Whether I was actually what?  Your word dropped out.  Oh, sorry.  The rape.  Yes.  Was I actually raped?  In the one scene in The Hills Have Eyes, there's a...  Yeah, I mean...  The mutant is attacking you.  Yeah, he rapes me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's brutal.  And you guys got a bet?  Wait, are you asking her if in real life she was naked? 
[03:10:00]  What do you say?  Your word dropped out.  No, I'm sorry.  No, there's this scene where it looks like he's raping her, but then they keep cutting  to him and cutting to her, and you can't really see if there's...  Dude, it's obvious.  Jesus.  Well, I haven't ever been raped, Anthony.  I don't know.  You don't have to be raped to know what it looks like.  Jeez.  This big, dumb-looking thing is on top of her, of course.  I've never seen the movie.  It's obvious that she's being raped?  Oh, yeah.  So, you don't think it's obvious because of how they filmed the scene, Josh? 
[03:10:30]  I like penetration.  It's not porno.  It's a horror movie, you dummy.  Oh, enough for you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  God.  Josh has apologized for our stupid listeners sometimes.  Jeez, are they dummies?  I think she's kind of enjoying it.  I hope so.  It's amusing.  It is amusing.  It's funny.  It's not the same old interview, right?  No, not at all.  You've probably got to do a lot of these today.  Yeah, quite a few.  You'll remember this one.  I'll tell you right now. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, I will.  It's already there.  Yeah, it's reigned.  How was CW11?  They're our friends.  How was that?  It was good.  It was fun.  Did they ask you really good questions, or was it just kind of like...  No, it was good.  It was very good.  Did they ask you about your marriage that failed miserably after six months?  No.  No, but they knew that I was happily married.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  Of course they did.  So, you were on a show that lasted one season, Lost.  Right.  You stink.  We're morons.  Has there been somebody on Lost that you have never worked with?  I don't know. 
[03:11:30]  I don't think so.  Maybe some of the others, but no, because we always have these big group scenes occasionally  where everyone's just there standing around.  Yeah, something.  And then you'll see, like, my favorite are some of the extras that have to just be there  to fill out the scene.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, what about my story?  You know, I crashed too, and I'm here wondering what the hell's going on.  And then sometimes they do.  Sometimes it's like, oh...  They go into it a little bit sometimes.  An extra gets a part now.  Naveen Andrews, is that Saeed?  Yes.  I swear to God, until I saw this, I thought Naveen Andrews was a woman's name. 
[03:12:00]  Really?  I thought...  I had no idea.  I don't know...  That's so mean.  No, I love Saeed, but I just...  Naveen doesn't sound like a guy's name, and they never match it up with anybody's face,  so I have no idea who...  Oh, right, because the credits just roll.  They just roll in alphabetical order, so I had no idea who played who.  Oh, he's good.  That last episode was pretty good.  I won't tell you, Jimmy.  But, uh...  Right?  Right?  What happened?  And then when Ben's walking away...  What happened?  That face he makes...  And then what?  So telling. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah?  That Ben, we've had him on here, and what a despicable character.  He plays on that show.  Oh, it's fantastic.  He's just like...  He's so docile, but so violent and awful.  Yeah.  And then he comes on the show, and he's a nice guy.  He's got these amazing eyes that just show so much.  And he can put that voice on.  Like, he'll just talk, but then all of a sudden he puts that...  It's so creepy, right?  ...creepy voice on.  Yeah.  Probably one of the creepiest characters on a TV show that...  Very unassuming looking.  He doesn't look like he'd be that...  Just a normal guy.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  But, yeah.  That creepy, but...  Oh.  And then what was...  Who was his buddy?  He was in the last episode, too.  He's dead now, but it was like a flash.  Is he dead, or did he die?  The big guy that turns out to be gay?  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Friendly.  Mr. Friendly.  Tom.  He had his little buddy in the hotel room there with him.  Yes, he did.  Give him a little kiss, and you're like, what?  Well, he said earlier that she's not my...  It's not my style, Kate.  Right, right.  So you kind of knew.  Yeah.  Kind of knew, but you know...  You see him kissing some young man in a hotel room. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  It's a little much.  Emily.  That's pretty funny.  The listeners are loving that you cursed.  Yeah, she dropped an F-bomb.  You dropped the F-bomb, and they were loving it.  Oh, down under?  I'm pleased.  Oh, is that all I have to do to gain...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, just...  That's it.  Just swear some more.  What's your favorite curse?  It's got to be the C, because that's the big one everyone loves using with that accent.  Probably fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Now they're...  You use that one all the time.  Now they're really losing it out there.  One of my personal favorites.  Yeah.  Let's say how to... 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  This is the easiest one to remember.  Yeah.  When you're angry.  Let's say how to...  Or Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel's a bad one, too.  Nagel is what we say here in the States.  It means a shit.  Yeah.  We just say Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Yeah.  So if you just go, ah, big hunk of Nagel, steaming pile of Nagel.  I've never heard that.  Yeah.  Are you screwing with me?  No.  No, just ask Eric Nagel in the...  Just say, are you fucking with me?  He's over there.  And then we'll answer correctly.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Texas.  Jerry.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[03:14:30]  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy, I know you're looking for a new lotion, and we asked her about a lotion.  You know how your skin's a little bit dry?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's got...  You've got to check out Jimmy's arm.  Why?  Why?  What's up?  They make fun of me because I have just little wispy arm hairs.  I don't have man arms.  Here, just show her.  That's nice.  It's embarrassing.  Look at his arms.  It's embarrassing.  So you want a cream to grow more hair?  Well, just touch it.  Just touch it right there.  It's him.  Look, look, look. 
[03:15:00]  He scares people.  What just happened there?  I just giggle when people talk about it.  He tries to scare people like that.  Oh, that's a good face.  That's a good thin face.  Wow.  Oh, did you see that scene?  No.  He looks a little worse for wear.  Maybe he shouldn't.  I'll tell you what happened.  This is what I watched up to the part.  I watched this week's episode up to the part.  Oh, wait until you find out why he's making that face.  Where they're all running.  Where Sawyer goes to get the kid and is coming back. 
[03:15:30]  And they go, he can't get back in.  Yeah.  That's where he's going to get me.  Did he go to get you?  I don't remember because I didn't see that far.  I just saw Sawyer.  He picked her up from the exploded house.  But nothing.  It was just a band-aid.  And to the clothes horse.  Yeah.  Just a band-aid.  I didn't get that far.  Let's go to Ted in Atlanta.  Ted Turner, everyone.  Yes.  I really love the way Emily says the word Charlie.  Can you say Charlie?  Charlie.  Charlie.  Charlie.  How many times was that in the script? 
[03:16:00]  I know.  There's Charlie.  Probably at least five times an episode.  Yeah.  You worked with him a lot.  I guess there's some people.  Do I see you with Locke a lot?  Yeah.  Quite a bit.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because I'm in his group now, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was also protecting you when Charlie was acting a fool with the baby.  Locke is the one that was giving him a beating.  True.  A beating.  Hey, when an actor gets killed off on the show, do you guys, because you know you're not  going to see him anymore.  Is there a really weird grieving on the set, just because you know that you're not going 
[03:16:30]  to see this guy that you've worked with so much?  Yeah, it is weird.  It is weird, especially when they don't live where you work, too.  So it's not like you're going to see them at a coffee shop or something.  I hate to tell you, but I'm very lost.  So much to show.  Hey, if you curse again, we'll promote your movie.  I'm trying to help out the listeners.  They're loving this.  One guy says, have her say, I want to get off this fucking island. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, my God.  They did it on CW11.  That would just be...  Yeah, Emily, could you say that?  I mean, you don't get an opportunity to say that on any other interview you're doing today.  What am I supposed to say?  I want to get off this fucking...  I want to get off this fucking island.  There you go.  The movie's called Balls...  How is that?  Now you can promote the movie.  I was ready to promote your movie by saying the movie's called Balls Don't Lie.  They really don't.  That's the porn of this movie.  Yeah, the porn title.  That's going to be the X-ray version, right.  Lift a dress, oh, you.  And now Bill Kaye wants you to say, where's my baby? 
[03:17:30]  What about my baby?  Oh, no.  I've said that.  It's ingrained in my mind.  Is that the one that Bob Kelly hates?  I don't know.  Bob Kelly loves his show, but he doesn't like how you say...  He's one of our guys that does the show a lot, and he doesn't like how you say baby.  Well, it was just always...  It annoys him.  He loves you, but the one thing...  It was just that she was always saying that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My baby, my baby, you know.  All right. 
[03:18:00]  Enough about the baby.  Your baby will be fine.  My baby's been taken about six times.  Yeah, quite a few times.  I seem to get it back unharmed.  Yeah, somehow.  I also like this line, I'm coming with you.  No one can seem to stay put anywhere.  It's like, well, I'm going to head over here.  I'm coming with you.  And the other person says, no, don't come.  And they go, yes, I'm coming.  And then there's a pause.  And they go, all right.  Let's go to James and Riverhead. 
[03:18:30]  James.  James.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Emily.  Any future news on when Jack's going to find out you're his sister?  Oh, I forgot about that.  Possibly.  How about that one?  Possibly.  And I heard...  They're supposed to answer every question with possibly.  What's that?  You heard what, sorry?  Charlie may be in some sort of episode this week with Jack.  Charlie is in an episode already.  Possibly.  Oh, because Jack is going to have like a horrid fever and everything, because he's going to 
[03:19:00]  be very sick.  And he'll probably see some things and some people and get some wisdom.  You know, it is really...  I would think.  It is weird.  The end result of Loft is going to be wizardry.  There you go.  Hey, can we show off the instant feedback?  Because now they're asking for stuff that I can't...  You can't have requests for that.  I can't...  She's going to charge...  She's a charming young woman.  I can't read half this stuff.  You're lucky I can't see that far.  Yeah.  I mean... 
[03:19:30]  Why?  What are they...  God.  Have her say, shut your fucking mouth and...  Oh, come on.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I'm getting at.  She's a nice woman.  Are we children?  Are we?  We're children.  There's six-year-olds listening to this.  No, they're not.  No.  No.  Maybe.  No one's listening.  No one's listening at all.  No one's listening.  You didn't see the satellite ratings?  Trust me.  All right.  Emily, it was a pleasure.  We love your laugh.  These guys love you on Lost.  And they loved your cursing.  And they loved your cursing. 
[03:20:00]  Well, it was a pleasure.  And the movie's going to be...  It's called Ball.  Ball.  Don't lie.  Don't lie.  Look, she can't read porn titles.  All right.  Can we turn this off?  Look, she's probably got a lot of interviews to do.  Oh.  We should let her go.  Before we really say something stupid and hit her face.  I know.  And never have another lost person on again.  Well, if you can't figure it out, I'm just kind of like beating her.  Would you stop it?  I just want her to go, oh, hell, I'll read whatever you want.  And then we'll print this stuff out.  I'll be the asshole.  I'm the nice one. 
[03:20:30]  Depends.  Just keep that in mind.  I'm just having fun.  I know.  It's good cop, bad cop.  He knows.  Don't mind anything he says, because it's probably him trying to get you, like, going.  What are you doing?  I'm blowing up your spot for just this once.  Why?  Any other guest, I would leave you alone and let you play.  Why are you getting uncomfortable?  Because we play good cop, bad cop, and it works very well.  Why are you getting uncomfortable?  Because I like the show a lot, and I think she's fantastic, and she's very pretty.  I've been enjoying her giggling at us the whole time. 
[03:21:00]  Like, we're morons.  Well, she lost all respect after us.  So, you're married and divorced three times a month.  What happened?  How could she take us seriously?  Oh, I know.  And then that man-child walks in.  I got it off Wikipedia.  This biracial zero.  Dummy.  Just, and he waltzes out with this stupid afro.  You shot your husband?  Is that what happened?  It's written down.  The beauty of Sam is like, yeah, don't blame me.  I got it off Wikipedia.  She starts laughing immediately, because she's like, oh my God, even my, like, four-year-old  niece knows that's garbage. 
[03:21:30]  But that's happened before with other guests.  I've asked other questions, and I thought, oh, this should be a very interesting conversation  point, and it turns out it was completely false, because, you know, people just, whatever  they read online, look out.  They should just go with it.  Yeah, yeah, that's what happened.  Right.  All right, well.  I also have five illegitimate children.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah?  My babies.  Well, I'm going to update Wikipedia after this interview.  You should, yeah.  No, that wouldn't be nice.  Oh, see, that was a good scene right there.  Did you see this, Jimmy?  Which one?  Oh, yes, I did.  Oh, okay. 
[03:22:00]  I did.  Where he takes the gun.  Yes, I did see that.  That Ben's a badass.  Oh, yeah.  He is just a badass.  Wait, how did you guys get in the desert?  Did you get...  It's in the future.  This is him, yeah.  It's like a...  They were having flashbacks and then flash forward.  Someone had decided, yeah, let's have a flash forward.  I got a lot of catching up.  Let's have a flash sideways.  It makes it so much more confusing.  Yeah.  In a good way.  But still, you're like...  You just need it a little more confusing.  Well, it's good because they don't do that...  ...thing with a flash forward.  Through the eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The eye opens.  Yeah.  I got a question.  I've never seen Lost, so how many hours do I have to watch to catch up? 
[03:22:30]  Holy Jesus.  A lot.  You're just screwed.  No, I'm not even kidding.  How many?  You're screwed.  You really...  The show is so specific and there's so much going on.  Oh, I would never just start watching.  I'd have to start from the beginning.  You'd have to start from the beginning.  How many seasons is it up to?  Fourth season.  So if you started today...  And there's 13 per year?  No, there were 22.  Oh, fuck.  Someone could get you by Christmas.  And they're an hour each.  They're 42 minutes each without commercial.  I'm so dumb.  You will be so addicted. 
[03:23:00]  I can't tell you how fast I got hooked on this show.  Yeah.  From the first episode, it's so brilliantly ready.  The pilot's probably one of the best pilots ever.  I like the pilot a lot.  Yeah.  It was really interesting.  You just didn't know what was going on.  I assumed, okay, this is going to be a 2000s version of Gilligan's Island.  Great.  They're going to crash.  And then how far can you go with it?  Apparently very far.  Yeah, right.  I cry a lot watching Lost, too.  I swear to...  I've cried during...  I'm such a Mary.  I have cried during so many Lost episodes. 
[03:23:30]  We were on a train once, and my ex there was with me.  And when Locke got shot in the little ditch...  Oh, yeah.  And it really kind of looked like he was dead.  Yeah.  You know, being killed.  She starts...  Crying.  Like, it's okay.  He'll be fine.  Yeah, no one's really dead.  It's Lost, right?  Don't worry about it.  Someone's saying it would take...  They're not going to kill off a character like him, although they did kill off, you know,  what's his name?  Echo?  Yeah, Echo.  Echo?  I couldn't believe...  What was that?  A contract dispute? 
[03:24:00]  That guy was on fire.  I know.  With the whole Nigerian plane thing, and you're like, this guy is here for good.  He was a good character, yeah.  He's dead.  Someone said it would take 90 hours to catch up.  It's straight.  You can get addicted, though.  It's a very...  Box sets are like...  They're the downfall.  I just finished The Wire.  Just sitting here, listening to people discuss your show.  She really wants to smack her face.  How silly is that?  What?  She's just like, keep discussing my show, all right?  You know when you're sitting at FH Riley's, and there's a bunch of fans sitting around  talking about this show?  Yeah.  How much you hate it?  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  That's what she's doing right now.  No, I don't hate it.  I'm very happy that you guys like the show.  How long is it going to take for you?  Except for you, because you haven't seen it.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  How long after this interview are you going to fire your publicist for getting you on this show?  I'll give it about five minutes.  Let her go.  She's got to go, right?  Yeah.  Are you happy, Sam?  They're going, yes, yes.  Did this go okay?  Are you happy?  Did it go well?  Well, her teeth...  Oh, no.  It didn't go well at all.  We could read body language.  You know, you don't have...  That's what's going to be the conversation in the elevator. 
[03:25:00]  You don't have to curse, because people tell you to.  Yeah.  That's not good for you, really.  Don't do that.  Don't you know who you are?  Aw.  Well, yes.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Can I get a picture with you, please?  Sure.  Why are you asking her now?  Yeah, we took her off the air.  Because, no, because on the air, she has to say yes, so she seems mean.  She would say yes.  I mean, she's very mean.  She doesn't seem mean.  I said yes.  You mean, so don't seem mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, so you don't seem mean.  No, you would seem mean if you said no.  She wouldn't say no, though.  Why would she?  Yeah.  Well, this interview went well.  It was great.  She did.  It did.  It went very well. 
[03:25:30]  You know, she's in a hurry.  Anthony, don't be too mad on yourself.  No, never you, the publicist.  No, Anthony.  Because they're usually the mean ones.  What's going on is Anthony's a fanboy when it comes to law, so he's very, very nervous.  He wants these interviews to be, like, perfect.  Yeah, they've got to go well, because I want, like, the whole cast eventually.  That's what's going on here today.  He's a huge fan.  Does Sawyer get a lot of girls?  I look at him, and it depresses me.  The guy who plays Sawyer, he's so handsome.  I'm like, because I'm such a psycho, like, I'll see him, and all I'll picture is my girlfriend  sleeping with him.  Oh, no. 
[03:26:00]  You look cuckled.  Why do you do that?  You're torturing yourself.  Because I'm like, that's the type of guy that could just take your woman, and she would  shamelessly leave me.  Did you see him in the crying video in Aerosmith?  I didn't know.  Pretty funny.  He's got, like, two seconds in that.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he steals the purse and runs down the sidewalk.  That's funny.  Pretty funny.  Well, let's save that gem until he's in.  First we had the failed marriage, and then that one.  Oh, we got a bombshell for him if he ever comes in.  You're an ass.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:26:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Iraq.  Here's Sam.  Sam, after the break, intern David.  The world's greatest intern.  The greatest intern of all time.  I know.  He can't run out of enough good things to talk about David.  He's eating pubes.  He's kissing ass cheeks.  What's this little Jew going to do next?  He's smelling buttholes.  Stay tuned.  And it's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Iraq.  He is Sam.  We do this all the time.  Sam, this one.  Intern David.  Always radio goalie.  My favorite intern of all time.  Intern David.  In this bit here, for some reason, he's eating pubes. 
[03:27:00]  Yes.  Well, Lillian, who used to hang out at the Ron and Fez show.  Stalk the Ron and Fez show.  Okay.  You could put it that way, too.  She was always a creep, but she was convinced to pull some pubes out, and we convinced intern  David to eat those pubes.  After that, Danny pulled his pants down, and we convinced David to just give his ass cheek  a little peck.  Does he do it?  Yeah.  We convinced him.  I already said that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So, he does.  So, no, uh... 
[03:27:30]  But what else happens?  Yeah, there's no tease for this anymore.  Well, I mean, it's coming up right now.  As a matter of fact, just listen to it.  You'll get all the details.  Or not.  He just told you what it all was.  I didn't tell you the whole thing.  I didn't tell you that we ran his face in at the end.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, crap.  You're listening to the worst, worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sorry about that.  Where's David?  That's silly.  David!  David!  David needs to redeem himself.  Why?  He doesn't, but...  Because he also kissed a boy.  David?  David?  Hi, David. 
[03:28:00]  You kissed a man today.  Yes, I certainly did.  Yeah, and you need to redeem yourself a little bit and get a little more masculine.  A little more manly.  Okay.  We have one of Lily's pubes here on the piece of paper.  You two met yesterday or Friday.  Yes.  If you would take that pube and just...  Eat it?  Yeah.  Eat the pube.  Eat the pube.  Just eat the pube.  Eat the pube.  All right.  All right.  It's right there.  It is kosher.  Bon appétit.  It's kosher. 
[03:28:30]  No, it really is.  We had it blessed.  There it is.  Just leave it there.  Don't lose it.  You had it blessed by a rabbi?  It's pretty hard for you to fucking get it.  It is.  That's what I was going to say.  God, Lily.  There it is.  It's the longest one, Jimmy.  It is a long-ass pube.  Wow, look at David.  On Earth.  David?  The longest one on Earth.  You're going to lose it.  Stop.  David?  Why don't you stand in front of a fan for a little while or on the...  I'm not going to lose it.  All right.  Now pick it up.  David got very excited about this.  Pick it up now.  No, it doesn't smell.  Put it on the tongue.  Put it on the tongue and kind of roll it around. 
[03:29:00]  What?  What?  It's hair.  I'm not going to roll it.  I'm going to just put it in my mouth and swallow it.  Well, whatever it takes.  Whatever.  Whatever.  It's like matzo?  You're chewing a pubic hair?  No one chews pubic hair.  How do you get them down, too?  See, you know nothing because you haven't eaten pussy yet.  Good luck swallowing that motherfucker.  How many guys have spent, like, hours trying to...  All right, should I try to swallow it?  And they just don't go down.  The dingleberries are a lot easier to swallow. 
[03:29:30]  How are you doing, David?  I think it's down.  You think it got down?  I think so.  You think so.  It's either down or it ain't.  Yeah, come on, kid.  David's wearing...  It's down.  It's down.  You did it?  All right.  David's wearing Lily's pubes on his head.  It's down.  It's down.  You got it.  All right.  Good man.  You redeemed yourself as a guy.  I don't know.  My throat feels weird after that pube.  You can't quite get it down is what it is.  I don't even know if it's down.  It feels weird.  It's stuck in your epiglottis.  It feels weird. 
[03:30:00]  It feels...  My throat feels weird, yeah.  David, we...  Your throat feels weird.  Yeah.  David's a pervert.  So obvious.  Can we confess to David what he really just put in his mouth?  Yeah, I know.  It was a Lily's pube.  No, it wasn't a Lily's pube.  Nope.  It wasn't.  Do you think a girl, first of all...  You've seen some nude girls around here, right?  Yes.  And what is one common thing with their pussies?  That they're clean shaved.  They're clean shaved.  That's what girls do.  You know what guys' pubes look like?  Yes, I know.  Do you know what's not clean shaven? 
[03:30:30]  Yes.  Danny's ass.  That hair came from Danny's fucking asshole.  That was the hair that surrounds Danny's asshole.  I thought it was Lily's pube.  Yeah.  We know.  We know you did.  Well, we didn't think you would just eat Danny's fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Would you?  Why not?  It's nice.  Well, I guess I did.  Stay out of this one.  But if we asked you to, would you have?  Probably not, no.  Would you give Danny's asshole, like, a kiss?  No.  Not lick it.  Just like a quick kiss.  No, I wouldn't.  No.  I guess you don't want to work here anymore. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, I guess you don't.  We've all done it.  Fuck.  Would you kiss Danny's nipple?  No.  Why?  Why?  Dude, we'll miss you, man.  It sucks.  Just the nipple?  That's a bit too much for me.  Ask Sam.  He's done all this and more.  Yes, I have.  Sam will even show you before you do it.  I don't think I really would want to.  I don't really want to.  It's too far.  If Sam kisses Danny's ass, will you kiss Danny's ass?  No.  How about the nipple?  Just the nipple.  No.  How about both of you guys at the same time? 
[03:31:30]  I've already found out that I've done too much.  You haven't done too much.  You haven't done enough for our show.  One kiss on...  You just kiss Danny's cheek.  That's it.  Yeah.  You don't even have to be near the brown spot.  Kiss his cheek?  No.  Dead center.  Danny, why don't you...  I said dead center on his sinkhole.  Danny, why don't you present your ass?  No.  Present.  No.  Okay, and present.  No.  My cheeks or my tits?  I would say the tits. 
[03:32:00]  You want my titties?  Would you lick his nipple?  No.  I wouldn't.  Why?  What if we blindfold you and you don't know if it's a girl or a guy?  That's a great one.  He'll never have any idea who we put in front of him.  Why would we put a girl in front of him?  Why would we?  I'm going to be retarded.  Look at his nips.  David?  I think I've gone too far.  Look at his hairy nips.  I see that.  David, you're a poor guy, aren't you?  Yes?  Yeah.  If I were a rich man... 
[03:32:30]  David, there's 20 to start.  Oh.  20 beans.  What do I got to do for that?  You have to lick Danny's nipple.  I'll put in 20.  Wait a minute.  Not just his nipple.  Let's...  Kiss his ass?  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  Yeah, what about them?  I'll lick my sweating balls.  No, this is...  Stop talking and start sucking.  We got 40 bucks on the table, David.  Halfway to your next Yankee...  Halfway to your next Yankee cranky. 
[03:33:00]  Yep.  It's not about all the money.  It's nothing to do with the money.  No.  Someone's saying we're ripping off Vince McMahon.  Kiss.  They do it on WWE, and it's not gay.  Sam, tell them.  It's true.  William Regal did it.  Yep.  You want us to show you the video?  That's all we're doing.  Man, it's the same thing that WWE does, and that's family fucking TV.  Kiss my ass.  If we could prove that the WWE did this, will you kiss Danny's ass?  For $40.  What do I got to do?  Just give a kiss?  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  A good one, like what we're going to show you.  What do you mean by a good one?  Sam, you get to buff Danny's ass to get it ready for the big kiss.  I don't know.  I'll throw you a bone today.  You were good.  I'll throw you one, too.  I think this is a bit too much for me.  What if we show you the video?  This is family TV.  We're just taking a page from family TV.  What are you doing?  You don't like family?  What's wrong with you?  What are you, a man?  Did that pubic go down yet? 
[03:34:00]  I think so.  It's down.  You don't know.  How much money have we got on the table so far?  $40, I think.  Yeah, $40.  You can't use $40?  I could.  All right, well, look.  Show the video.  Is it going to be on the big screen?  This is all we're doing, and this is family TV.  What am I looking for?  Oh, you have to just look on the screen.  It's broken.  All right, look.  This is all you have to do.  Danny, Sam, what is this again?  It's William Regal joins the Kiss My Ass Club. 
[03:34:30]  They had a name for it and everything.  Oh, $40.  All right, turn around.  Show them.  This is Vince.  Oh, no.  What?  What's the matter?  The pube?  The pube didn't go down at all.  It popped back up, right?  It popped back up.  It certainly did.  It dropped down at all.  See?  It's the gift that keeps on giving.  Yeah.  The pube was still there.  It didn't go down.  Swallow it.  I can't.  Hey, look.  Get it down.  Look, this is the Kiss My Ass Club.  Vince McMahon is a billionaire, by the way.  I know.  All right.  The pube is...  Just when you think it's down... 
[03:35:00]  The pube is not even down by one of the slightest.  No?  I thought you said it was down.  I thought it was, but all of a sudden it appeared.  I felt it on my tongue, like, ten minutes later.  Swallow that.  I can't do it.  I need some, like, water to swallow it down.  It's not going down.  You're not going to get water.  If you go down on a girl...  Yeah.  ...and you get a hair in your mouth, what are you going to do?  I didn't swallow the pube.  I thought it was down.  You can't make the spitting sound, because that's offensive.  It resurfaced.  You can't call mommy to help you.  Right.  You're on your own.  You can't get a drink of water.  Hang on.  You guys are going to miss the completely not homoerotic WWE clip that's playing right now. 
[03:35:30]  Right.  So this is all we want you to do, David.  And Vince McMahon is a billionaire.  And this is family TV.  Oh, he just did a little peck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the ass.  We want open mouth, both lips, kissing Danny's ass.  That's all.  Danny's brown eye.  I'm going to tuck to make sure everything's in his face.  Give him a fruit bowl.  Give him a fruit bowl.  No, no, no.  How much for a fruit bowl?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:36:00]  How much for a fruit bowl, really?  Come on.  Kiss his fruit bowl.  Everyone has a price.  No.  If you kissed his fruit bowl.  No, no, no, no.  But we have to put lipstick on you so we know you really did it.  No, no.  It's not a dick and balls when it's a fruit bowl.  Yeah.  It's a fruit bowl.  You can't call it dick and balls if it's called a fruit bowl.  Right?  No, no.  By 1130, this is going to be a rainbow party.  No, no, no, no, no.  All right.  Would you kiss Danny's ass for 40 hours?  I'll do it like this video, like a little peck. 
[03:36:30]  All right.  That's nice, too.  Danny, get up on the counter.  Ugh.  Jesus.  Danny's pretty sick.  He's presenting.  Danny's pretty sick.  Wait.  Get up on what?  On the, uh...  Danny's presenting.  He's presenting.  Ha, ha, ha.  Danny, get up on the table.  On the console?  Yeah, please.  Where you want me?  On all floors.  He's pretty sick.  We're facing, what?  Facing, like...  This is pretty sick.  Facing David.  Whatever you need to do.  All right.  This is pretty sick in your video.  Shut up.  We're just redoing a stupid WWE video. 
[03:37:00]  Fucking, there's kids in the audience for that crap.  I'll do it so everybody can get a good look.  It's just a little kiss.  That's all.  All right.  Danny's going to present his ass.  He's presenting.  He's...  What am I exactly doing?  Just giving a little kiss?  Of course Sam goes right behind Danny as he presents his ass.  You're tonguing his asshole.  I'm producing.  Yeah.  Sam, what do you think of Danny's ass?  I wouldn't put the dick in today.  I mean, you know, it's not bad.  You're going to have to squeeze around that way, though.  What's going on?  Come on, David.  Come on, David.  It's just a little kiss, right?  We've all done it. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, but you've kissed the middle.  You're just joining a very special club.  Not the middle, no.  I pray.  Wait, David, what are you looking at?  Please.  I wish.  David, what are you looking at?  I'm looking at Danny's ass.  Explosive diarrhea.  David, what does it look like?  Looks like a ass.  Well, describe it.  Like, what kind of ass does Danny have?  It's a little bit big.  It's hair.  There's some hair.  It's big?  Yeah.  It's a little bit big. 
[03:38:00]  It's hair.  There's some hair in the middle.  Yeah.  I think in a good way.  All right.  What part are you going to kiss?  Just the butt cheek.  Well, Jimmy's going to help us through this.  Jimmy?  Of course Jimmy is.  Just the butt cheek.  That's all I'm doing.  All right.  I love that bit.  Of course, Jimmy.  Hey, to tear down the wall, but I love that bit.  Jimmy, where do you suggest?  It's got to be a little.  I'm not doing it in the middle anyways.  Right on the crack.  How about this?  Oh, no.  How about this?  If you don't want to do the middle, how about this?  You do the right cheek, and then you just drag your lip quickly to the left cheek. 
[03:38:30]  No, no.  One kiss on the one cheek.  That's it.  No, you've got to drag.  And give him a reach around.  David, if you drag your tongue over his asshole, I'll throw in another $20.  A rusty trombone.  Give my ass cheeks a little bit.  No, no.  How about this?  I don't need the money anyways.  I don't care about the money.  No, you do need the money.  Just a little kiss.  No, you do need the money.  No, I don't.  Let's start a little smooch.  But you've got to be on the right cheek.  Sam, show him how it's done, please.  Really?  I don't remember how it's done.  I don't know.  Just go guess. 
[03:39:00]  Just take a guess.  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm not doing it.  I'm just giving him a kiss on the cheek.  That's all.  Sam will, like, kind of walk you through this.  I don't care.  Can I just lead him through it?  I don't care if he walks me through it.  I'm not going to do it.  Sam used to be an intern, so Sam, show him.  Show him what you had to do to be an intern on the show.  What if I just put my hand on the back of his head and guide him?  No.  I'm not doing that.  I'm just giving him a kiss on the cheek, so.  What's wrong? 
[03:39:30]  What's the difference between his cheek and if you kiss his ass crack?  It's a little too much for him.  Not the asshole.  We're just talking the crack.  I know, but it's still too much.  So what's the difference?  He's sweaty, too.  It's uncomfortable for me.  I can't explain.  What's the difference?  What's wrong?  It's uncomfortable.  It's either an ass cheek.  Yeah.  Do Sam need to give me an example or no?  Yeah.  I'm going to kiss the cheek. 
[03:40:00]  All right.  Are we ready?  Jimmy, you ready over there?  Yeah, ready to go.  Bye.  Do I need an example?  Follow me, Dave.  Go to this cheek like I go to this cheek.  It's just a little kiss.  I'm not doing the...  Wait.  We're doing a double?  Yeah.  I'm just going to show him.  Well, why don't you show him ahead of time?  You show him, Sam.  You show him.  Yeah, you show him first.  Watch.  David, if Sam does it...  You've got to come in close.  You've got to come in close, David.  I'm watching.  You have to come close, David.  I'm not coming close.  I'm watching for many.  David.  You're going to push your head.  And we all know Sam has a girlfriend that's going to be leaving him soon.  But he does have a girlfriend.  So Sam, why don't you show David how it's done? 
[03:40:30]  I'm not putting my head...  You're going to drag my head and do it.  I'm not doing that.  No.  David, just get to the cheek.  I'm waiting for you to show me how to do it.  Just get...  I don't feel any mouth on my ass.  I'm waiting for Sam to give me an example.  I'm waiting for Sam to give me the example of how to do it.  I don't know how.  Well, I think you should still kiss his ass, David.  I will.  After Sam shows him how to do it, I'll show him how to do it.  I think you know how to kiss his ass.  I think David raises an excellent point.  After Sam shows him, he'll do it.  David, will you do it if I do it? 
[03:41:00]  I will kiss...  I will give a kiss on one of the butt cheeks.  I will not do it...  I'm not going to do it probably the way you are going to do it.  What's that supposed to mean, you son of a bitch?  I don't know how you're going to show me, but...  Oh, Sam, are you going to take that?  David, I'm trying to lead you to something here.  Will you do it if I do it?  I don't know.  I don't know exactly what you're going to do.  I'm just going to give a kiss on the cheek.  That's it.  I give a kiss on the cheek.  You give a kiss on the cheek.  Yes.  All right, let's...  You show it.  You first.  Enjoy it, Danny.  I'm going to, immensely. 
[03:41:30]  Why don't you perform a...  That was a kiss on my ass.  Sam...  There you go.  I did it.  Sam just kissed David's ass.  Sam's gay.  That's okay.  That's all I'm going to do, too.  You're so gay.  It's all right.  David, your turn.  That's all I'm going to do, too.  I don't need that money.  That's all I'm going to do.  By the way...  Take back the money.  Oopsie.  As far as taking a picture of my BlackBerry.  Hold on a minute.  I've got to send this off to somebody.  Not yet.  Am I going to get in trouble with side piece?  No.  No.  Maybe.  All right, David, you ready for your $40?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:42:00]  You saw Sam do it.  I don't need any money.  You know, I'm just happy that my ass is finally getting the attention it deserves.  There's cameras on it.  This is great.  It's like your ass is at a press conference.  There's so many cameras in here.  I'm a star.  Go ahead, David.  It's your turn.  Okay, ready?  Sam, you decide if you did a good enough job for the $40 or you're doing this for free.  I'm telling you right now.  Okay, fine.  Where's my money?  Come on, get with it, Sean White.  Sean White? 
[03:42:30]  Okay, here I go.  Oh!  Oh, David.  Did you see how deep he went in?  Wow.  I got to say, Sam's kiss was just a nice little peck.  Dave's a little wetter than I would have liked it to have been.  And Sam what?  Sam shoved his face right into the mouth.  Sam grabbed David's head and shoved his face right into Danny's asshole. 
[03:43:00]  I was expecting that.  Oh, God.  Wow, that's a perfect picture.  I'm an ass man.  Yeah, an ass man.  I'm an ass man.  Dave's an ass man.  I think Dave should get $20 for that.  Yeah, we'll give you $20.  You really didn't show gumption.  Yeah, it's too...  Here, you can do it right.  Jimmy takes his back.  He didn't impress him. 
[03:43:30]  Don't crumple it up.  Don't pick it up.  No, we could do is we could put the other $20 in Danny's asshole and you have to pull it out with your teeth.  No, no, no.  You know what I'll do?  I'll put it like underneath my ball sack so my sack is holding the bill and he has to get it any way that he deems necessary.  Where are you going, David?  David, where are you going?  What's wrong?  You all right, David?  I'm all right.  Let's make sure David's okay.  Did you break your nose?  No, I didn't break my nose at all, no. 
[03:44:00]  What happened?  Tell everybody what happened.  No, it's all good.  My face went in Danny's ass and my glasses fell off.  No, the glasses didn't fall off.  Oh, good.  Protective lenses.  It was kind of doing a bit there, David.  That's okay.  Would you kind of kiss mine?  I will not kiss you.  No.  No one will be near it.  I'm done with that.  There's an extra $20 in it for you.  Oh, David.  Oh, I know.  Sam.  How about this?  Bring him back in here.  How about this?  David, get back in here. 
[03:44:30]  How about this?  You don't have to kiss my butt.  No one will be near you.  You just blow air on it.  Oh, that's a good idea.  I won't touch you.  I promise you.  I won't touch you.  For the people playing at home, Jimmy has...  No, no.  David, I'm not going to touch you.  I don't lie to you.  I'm not going to touch you.  Oh, yeah.  I will not touch you.  David, how about if no one's in the room?  No one will be near you.  Danny, move out of the area.  No, no, no.  For $20, what I have to do is blow on Jimmy's ass?  Are you kidding me?  No, I will not do that.  I promise you.  Hi, dude.  Sam.  Sam will not be near you. 
[03:45:00]  You have my word.  What's the point of it?  You think it's funny to blow on somebody's ass?  It's creepy.  Yeah, because then Jimmy will do...  No, I'm not going to do that.  Jimmy will do some kind of tee-hee.  It'll be fun radio, and then we go home.  David, if I will...  We don't go home unless you do this.  Nobody will touch you.  I promise you.  Yeah.  I won't even be around.  Nobody will be around you.  Nobody.  How close, Jimmy?  Like a foot away?  That's fair.  I'd say within a couple inches, but no one will touch you.  Jimmy is a man of his word, David.  You can trust him until he proves you wrong.  I promise you, none of them will be around you.  Dave, we'll all stand behind Opie, so you could visually see all of us at all times. 
[03:45:30]  Because nobody will come near you.  What do I got to do?  You put a couple inches in my ass, and you blow air on my ass cheeks.  But I won't touch you.  Someone's going to push my head in.  No one's going to push you.  Close the door so, look, no one can run in.  Yeah, no one can come in, and we'll all stand behind Opie.  You can even hold your own mic, David.  Now, I've...  Sam, give him the mic.  Just...  Sam, wave.  Sam, go over there.  Everyone behind, over here.  Now, you can see everybody.  David, look. 
[03:46:00]  Is there anyone else in the room?  Who's going to push your head?  No one is going to touch you.  Who's going to push your head?  No one.  Someone's going to run over.  You'll see it.  You'll see it, and you'll run away.  No one.  I promise you.  Believe me, we tell them no one's going to fucking run over and touch you.  Right.  Do me promises.  If you want us getting you more Yankee Crankies, you've got to do this for our show.  I actually don't want you to touch my ass.  Yeah.  So what am I doing, then?  Putting your face by the cheeks and blowing.  Blowing or just blowing?  Blowing air.  Get on your knees.  I'm not going to touch you.  No one's going to touch you.  No one's going to touch you. 
[03:46:30]  Travis is over here.  Where do you want Travis so you're not nervous?  I saw someone whisper.  Mars was just whispering and how funny this is.  No one will move.  Dave, look around the room.  What could possibly go wrong?  We've got hip hop Ron on the camera.  The rest of the guys are way behind the camera near me.  So what's the point of this?  No one's going to touch you.  Because Jimmy will make a funny noise.  Hold on.  You're going to fart in my face or something.  No, I'm not.  That's stupid.  See, I told you. 
[03:47:00]  See?  See, I told you.  I didn't even blow you.  I didn't even blow you.  I didn't even...  I didn't even...  Dave, ass man!  See, I told you.  I knew I was going to do that.  Dave, ass man!  I wasn't going to touch you, though.  No, you weren't.  I told you nobody would touch you.  That was a damn good one, Jimmy.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing it.  Steven, as for Major, who knew David would be starring in the baby turd video? 
[03:47:30]  There you go.  You got $40.  Thank you.  Well, now I got $60 because you gave me $20.  Yeah.  I gave him $20.  Oh, then I could have my $20 back, then.  Now ask Jewish Kobe how your ass tastes.  Oh!  I could have my $20 back because Jimmy gave you $40.  It's only fair.  Fair is fair.  You know, if Jimmy's giving you the $40.  How easy is this kid?  I know.  He just gave...  Will you take my $20?  That was a joke.  Now I'll give you $20 if you kiss my ass again. 
[03:48:00]  All right, here.  Here's my $20.  I don't want people to think I'm cheap.  There you go.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Actually, I think Dave should probably apologize for making the show go so late.  David, I agree.  I had a doctor's appointment at 11.15.  We're crazy behind on Braves.  So if you don't mind, could you please apologize to myself especially and the show in general?  We really wanted to get out of here right at 11. 
[03:48:30]  And to me for those chap lips.  Right.  Yeah, and to me for fucking...  And apologize.  Say, look, I apologize that I kissed Danny's ass and...  Why should I apologize for that?  And was going to blow on Jimmy's ass until he farted.  I didn't mean to fart about this.  And because of that, you guys are really late and you're late for your doctor's appointment.  I think that's a good one, Danny.  If you will.  I apologize.  I'm sorry for making the show go late today.  Why did the show go late?  The show go late today because I didn't want to kiss Danny's ass for a while or blow on Jimmy's ass. 
[03:49:00]  But you did.  But I did, yes.  And why did you do that?  Who had a nice...  For the show.  I did it for the show because you guys wanted me to do it.  So I did it.  Who had a nice ass, me or Danny?  They were both nice.  You have to decide.  Yeah, look.  We all like different kinds of ice cream.  It's like Highlander.  There can only be one.  You do pick one that you like a little better than the rest of the flavors.  If I had to pick one, I would pick Jimmy's.  Why?  Why?  I don't like the hair on Danny's too much for me. 
[03:49:30]  I like Jimmy's.  It's not that bad.  He makes his hair over there.  So Jimmy's was clean.  So safe to say...  Sasquatch ass.  It's not bad at all.  I hate to say you're not a fan of hairy man ass, but if it's a smooth man's ass, you're  okay with it.  I guess so.  You could say that.  You could say that.  All right.  It really wasn't that bad, Danny.  Don't let me get you down.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Tippi likes mine the best.  Good luck explaining all this to you.  You're a chick.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Godspeed with that.  We're good at faking stuff for the radio, huh, guys?  What?  Especially since the man like David ate that thing. 
[03:50:00]  It's all fake.  I like three guys.  Uh-huh.  Ooh.  All right.  Which three guys?  All right.  What's wrong?  Why are you making a weird face, Dave?  I'm making a weird face.  I don't know.  He's still trying to get that pube out.  I don't think it went down.  I don't think it went down.  You can't get that pube out.  Hey, Dave, that's not a pube.  That's one of my ass hairs.  That's his asshole hair.  Whatever it is, it didn't go down.  I don't think it's having trouble going down, whatever it is.  You want to drink some water? 
[03:50:30]  That's all right.  Why?  You don't trust us with some water?  It's all right.  This is so bad.  It's all right.  He can wash it down, but he has to do a butt shot out of my crack.  Yeah.  It has to cascade over my...  All right.  That'll be a fruit bowl.  Fruit bowl.  That'd be great.  If we could have got the fruit bowl.  Oh, the fruit bowl.  Oh, my God.  Something's got to be done with the fruit bowl at some point.  How much...  I'll go to the goddamn ATM. 
[03:51:00]  How much would it take for you to...  What are we doing?  Placing or kissing the fruit bowl?  Oh, no, no, no.  Dave, we just listen?  I'm not doing that.  There's nothing wrong with listening.  I'm listening, but I'm not doing it.  And what is the fruit bowl?  Well, the fruit bowl is...  Well, you know what the tuck looks like from the front?  That's what it looks like the tuck from the back.  Right.  Is a fruit bowl.  Right.  Because it looks like a banana and a couple of, like, peaches or plums or whatever is back there. 
[03:51:30]  And since it's snuggled between your thighs and butt cheeks like a bowl, it is called the fruit bowl.  How much to kiss the fruit bowl, Dave?  Let's get right down.  You're a poor kid.  You got turned on to the Yankee Cranky Shop.  I know you want to go back there.  I got a solid hundred.  No.  To start.  No, no, no.  I'm not going to do it.  I don't want to kiss the fruit bowl.  That's too much.  I don't want to.  I would imagine my pal Ant's got a hundred, too. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to.  For the fruit bowl.  That's $200 cash.  For the fruit bowl.  I know what it is, but I don't want to.  All right.  I don't think he's going to do the fruit bowl.  No.  I'm not engaging in, basically, prostitution.  I'm not...  Male prostitution.  I'm not pimping out.  That would be a great headline for another fucking paper.  Fuck in there.  Oh, and hey, throw it off the air for a minute.  To the record, I'm not paying the intern to kiss Danny's fucking balls and cock. 
[03:52:30]  Sorry.  I'm a bit killer.  I'm out.  You can kiss the butt cheeks, but I'm not paying to have Danny tuck his fucking cock and  balls back by his asshole and get them kissed.  You just don't know how to have a good time.  Yeah.  What's the problem, Jimmy?  Jimmy puts things into perspective you can really understand.  What's wrong with the fruit bowl?  I don't know.  Just a tough one to explain to corporate if we get any shit.  You know, the stock's not exactly going through the roof.  They don't want any fucking headaches. 
[03:53:00]  Trying to fix debt and get all that shit paid off.  And we got a fruit bowl kissing going on.  They called it fruit bowl.  Wait.  Can you imagine what the reports would be on the news?  Yeah, imagine what the news would be.  Trying to describe what it is on the news.  An indescribable act on the shock jock radio show of Opie and Anthony once again in trouble.  How many meetings have we done like that?  What were you thinking when you had the dude kiss the fruit bowl?  It's known as a fruit bowl.  And they're interned with a known learning disability. 
[03:53:30]  I didn't want to do it.  And I told them, no, but they said they would give me $20.  Oh, boy.  We here in the newsroom cannot even describe what this fruit bowl is.  But they do the whole report with an actual fruit bowl.  But suffice to say, it is disgusting and despicable.  It just gave me an idea for a listener's submission contest.  Yeah.  Listeners have to produce their own news reports.  Oh, their own news reports.  Of the show being fired for one of these ridiculous things. 
[03:54:00]  For him having to kiss the fruit bowl.  Or anything else that's happened in the past.  We should have a fruit bowl contest where you actually do the fruit bowl, but then someone  paint it so it looks like real fruit.  You can glue little stems on your balls.  By the way, the timing might be off now, but Pat from Woonocky texted me.  He's calling this David's Choice.  David, did you want to kiss the fruit bowl?  No.  I definitely didn't.  Were the guys pressuring you to kiss the fruit bowl? 
[03:54:30]  Yes.  That's how that would look on the news.  Fucking terrible.  That would look terrible.  I'm a little confused, though.  I'm not with you on this.  What's wrong with the fruit bowl?  In theory, it's funny.  Okay.  But the idea that David's an intern, and we're saying, look, we'd like you to put your mouth  by Danny's cock and balls and then on it, we'll give you a huge amount of money we'll  pay you to do that.  There's no way that's allowable.  I'm not a lawyer.  We can't explain that one away?  It's an impossible one.  Kissing the butt cheek is explainable. 
[03:55:00]  He was paid money to put his mouth on another employee's genitalia.  Yeah.  Fruit bowl.  In what was known as a fruit bowl.  Yes.  A radio stunt gone bad.  Tom Brokaw would have to come out of retirement for this.  No one is a fruit bowl.  A young, innocent man was forced to kiss another man's genitals.  Travis was saying, he's wondering if the news has fruit bowl B-roll. 
[03:55:30]  They would just show a real fruit bowl, a banana, and a couple of fucking plums.  Or they'd show stock footage of people in clothes bending over to pick things up.  What part would be the worst about that?  The mouth on the fucking genitals, I think, would probably sum it up as worst.  Got me begging you for mercy.  Why won't you release me? 
[03:56:00]  You got me begging you for mercy.  Why won't you release me?  I said release me.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am Iraqia Sam.  Sam, after the break, Bruce Campbell's in the studio.  Cultural icon.  He is.  The legendary Ash from the Army of Darkness series. 
[03:56:30]  Bruce Campbell stops by the Opie and Anthony show of all places.  It was memorable, to say the least.  It's coming up next on the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  But first, we're going to do another guest of sound today.  We got this fine sound that just came in.  We're trying to figure out what this is.  Me looking at Super Tuesday results.  No?  Bob Kelly in the fourth quarter of a Patriot Super Bowl. 
[03:57:00]  Wow, that's a...  They're usually not the obvious.  Like, it sounds like somebody being hacked apart.  Right.  But it's probably something silly.  It's someone videotaping something, because I think the person laughing is videotaping.  Yes.  Oh, very good, Jimmy.  Jimmy's on to something there.  You use your forensic expertise.  You could hear screaming, and then all of a sudden, a laugh. 
[03:57:30]  You shouldn't have heard laughter in the middle of screaming, Sam.  It obviously was the person with the camera.  Do you think it's some kind of...  Anthony's afraid that blackness is contagious.  It's not, Sam.  You're born with it, or you're not.  Does it sound like that person was in some kind of distress?  Alive, dead?  Do you think it was natural causes?  What did that sound like?  I don't know.  I can't tell because of the 80 decibel song coming to my head. 
[03:58:00]  Sounds of one thing, E-Rock.  I'm going to be deaf, and you're going to be accused of murder.  Jim C.  I love Jim C.  Can't get enough of Jim C.  With his flat-ass girlfriend.  I know.  Turn the music louder.  They can't hear it, Sam.  Well, Clance, get your tiny genitals away from me, Sam.  Stop with the magnifying glass underwear.  You're not fooling anyone. 
[03:58:30]  Jim C.  That's right.  Jim C's a five-line pony.  I love him, though.  Those five lines are gold.  We got Steve in Boston.  He wants to play guest of sound.  Steve, go ahead.  Hi.  Is it that kid who runs the 200-meter screaming the entire way?  Steve, yeah, it is.  Is it?  Oh.  Thanks for ruining the bit.  Good guess.  Steve, do you understand what this bit's about?  Hmm.  Sorry, gentlemen. 
[03:59:00]  Would anyone care what the real answer is?  Not at all.  Isn't it fun to come up with, like, goofy answers?  Goofy answers about, uh, I don't know.  Isn't that the first time someone's guessed, though?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Steve wrecked it for everybody.  See, all the phones are lit with silly answers.  Now we can't do silly answers because you decided everyone needed to know the right answer.  Thanks, Steve.  Well, I'm a douche.  Enjoy your day.  Good.  You too.  Bye.  Look at that.  Somebody wanted to say a woman in a restroom. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  Standing in something that looks like spilled Jell-O.  Yeah, see?  We could have went with silly answers.  We don't give a crap what the real answer is when we do this bit.  Let me just make sure I understand.  We're mad at that guy.  We're giving the real answer when the bit is called, guess the sound.  And we're mad because he spoiled a miscarriage joke.  This is a repugnant radio show.  We are awful.  The virus.  XM2, series 197, 197. 
[04:00:00]  The virus.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2009.  Catch up on an entire year's worth of radio magic.  What?  In just one week, starting December 28th, featuring unforgettable, make that forgettable, moments like this.  Why don't we let Sharon and Brett Michaels hear this?  Sharon's already there.  Brett's busy.  They're going to promote an event.  You want to hear this, right?  I can just keep talking.  I'm ready.  There's no need for it because I'm just...  Oh, no.  Come on.  Let's hear it.  Here it is.  This is not it.  I'm ready. 
[04:00:30]  Come on, you...  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2009.  Beginning Monday, December 28th at 6 a.m. Eastern. 
[04:01:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. </pre>
