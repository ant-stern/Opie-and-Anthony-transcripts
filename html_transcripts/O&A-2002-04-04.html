<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of Alan Sniffin, a dentist and administrator of the "New York Radio Message Board," focusing on his negative commentary about their show and its syndication.  The hosts played and mocked audio from Sniffin's podcast, "Board Reflections," highlighting his criticisms and dismissing them with ratings data and anecdotal evidence.  The discussion, punctuated by vulgar insults directed at Sniffin, also included mockery of the seemingly inane topics discussed on his message board, such as "This Week in 1988" and FCC regulations.  Simultaneously, they struggled with recording a commercial for "Sweet Release," a product enhancing sexual encounters with fruit flavors, finding the script awkwardly phrased and sexually suggestive to the point of sounding "gay."  They attempted numerous rewrites and considered using a female voice-over.  This commercial read struggle continued with other products, including Dream Cream, performed comedically by Steve and Jim Norton.  A listener email compared their commercial reads to "the Bernie Taupin and Elton John of live reads," while a caller, Laura/Lisa, offered to record a suggestive version for Sweet Release.  A commercial read for an adult video store followed, full of sexually explicit language and improvisations.

A significant portion of the show featured a phone call with Dave, who claimed to be climbing Mount Everest without Sherpas to plant a "wow" sign at the summit.  His claim was met with widespread skepticism from the hosts and callers, questioning his preparation, permits, costs, and the inherent dangers involved.  This was followed by a humorous news story about a Titanic-themed inflatable ride collapsing, resulting in a $100 million lawsuit, which prompted further humorous commentary.  The hosts also touched upon the relative safety (or lack thereof) of playgrounds and rides compared to modern standards, referencing monkey bars, tire chains, and lawn darts.  They played several songs by Wesley Willis, a homeless musician.  A caller, Barry, contrasted the lack of lawsuits after the Titanic disaster with modern playground accident settlements. Other callers shared childhood playground injury anecdotes. This led back to another heated exchange with Alan Sniffin.

A major segment, "Sex Pet Peeves," featured female callers detailing their sexual frustrations with men, including flatulence during intimacy, poor oral sex, using bags over heads, inconsistent rhythm, and inappropriate touching.  The hosts engaged in humorous and sexually explicit discussions about these issues and the supposed "awesomeness" of their phone screener, "Awesome Garrett," whose performance initially drew their questioning.  Multiple listener calls contributed to this segment, including discussions of O&A's perceived sexism.  The "What Did We Learn" segment followed, featuring listener calls filled with crude humor about sex, relationships, and other topics.  A listener compared intercourse to driving on ice, another claimed to earn as much as Anthony from amusement park trips with his child, and multiple callers referenced the show's perceived sexism.  A dentist called expressing fear of the show, and "Awesome Garrett" received further praise. A listener recounted Ed Sullivan's alleged fellatio expertise.  The Iron Sheik made a brief appearance praising the show and WNEW.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts repeatedly promoted a contest for a trip to see Aerosmith at the MTV Icon awards in L.A., urging listeners to bring unusual items to their upcoming live broadcast in Boston.  The show also promoted Jim Norton's show and an event at the Cinema Cafe.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  How you guys doing? How you goddamn guys doing? How you guys doing?  Couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, you could use 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  You know, that could be an underlying theme today on the radio show, Anthony.  What's that?  Things we wouldn't have if we weren't syndicated.  Right.  What about all the hot pieces of asses that we got to check out from all over the country during our Naughty Nighty contest? 
[00:00:30]  Alan Sniffin, you douchebag.  What a dick.  You douche.  Jay, what's going on?  He is such a tool.  Well, now, see, for our syndication audience, see, O.B., this is what's going to ruin the show.  Having to explain to the other cities what this is all about.  Bad dentist.  The rock and roll radio dentist, Alan Sniffin.  Yeah, when does he have time to fill cavities, man?  I don't know. 
[00:01:00]  I got a tooth rotting away, and I'm waiting for an appointment.  Jesus, maybe you ought to find another dentist.  My dentist isn't spending all his time talking about radio.  One that's not making up his own radio show on the Internet every week or so.  Alan, how bad do you want to be doing exactly what Ant and I are doing?  Very, very badly.  You don't sound too jealous, you douchebag.  Very badly.  But he's, you know, you've got to pay the rent, so he's got to go in there and fill some molars.  Why don't you explain Alan Sniffin to the rest of the country, Anthony? 
[00:01:30]  Well, you know, the Internet, O.B., is just tons of message boards.  Everywhere you turn, there's a message board about something.  Alan Sniffin runs a message board.  It's called the New York Radio Message Board.  And, well, it's about New York radio.  With a lot to do about WABC Music Radio here in New York.  It was music radio back in, I think, 1894. 
[00:02:00]  I guess he was a big fan of WABC.  Big fan of that, so he's got a whole website dedicated to that.  And, hell, I was a big fan of crockpots, too, but I had to move on, you ass.  Move on.  And it seems a lot of people that frequent the New York radio message board don't really,  as far as I can see from reading a lot of the posts, they don't really understand radio.  They really don't.  Well, you think if you ran a message board that talked about New York radio,  it would be run by someone that maybe had some experience in the field? 
[00:02:30]  He'll tell you he had experience, Opie.  In what way?  I don't know.  He did a little radio show somewhere.  It's like you and I starting a message board about dentistry.  Dentistry, yes.  We're giving our opinions on dentistry.  The New York Dentistry Message Board.  And how, you know, we wish the dentists were doing it the old school way.  Right.  How does this newfangled equipment, even though they're now filling cavities with that white stuff,  I like the old lead stuff myself. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, no, no.  I like the mercury.  No, we've moved on, my friend.  The white is much better than the silver.  How do you know?  You're not a dentist.  Hey.  You're going to start a message board.  That's all you need.  Exactly.  Then I officially become an expert.  Well, Opie, this guy is such a tool.  And he's going to think that he got under our skin and stuff.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I enjoy talking about this.  The guy has wished for our failure ever since we stepped into New York to do radio. 
[00:03:30]  And the cronies on that message board.  Remember when that message board said that you and I wouldn't last three months in New York radio?  I'd like to.  Oh, they're not.  Okay, they made it to three months.  Well, they'll definitely not, you know, make it past six months.  Yeah.  They've been doing this every three months.  And then if we have a dip in the rating, see, they're over.  Oh, boy, it's done.  They're done.  Look, see, I told you so.  It's done.  And then next thing you know, our ratings go back up.  And they go away.  And they just like.  Then they just go away.  Like cockroaches when you turn the lights on. 
[00:04:00]  They just kind of hide.  Uh-huh.  And then they wait for that next time to pounce on us.  See, I told you.  So now he's pouncing again.  Even though we've been doing this for four years in New York and we've been quite successful.  Right.  They're just picking us apart and trying to come up with something.  Well, him and a lot of the people that frequent this board, it's, you know, the usual suspects,  the same cast of characters that have done nothing but trash this show on a daily basis. 
[00:04:30]  Well, no one wants to see us.  And no one wants to see us succeed.  No one wants it.  And then once even they realize, all right, these guys are going to be around a while,  then, like you said, they just pick their little shots and try to take them.  Uh, the latest thing, uh, or the thing that Alan Sniffen does every week, uh, with this message board,  he records in real audio his board reflections.  It's a little weekly, um, thing that you can download and listen to Alan Sniffen do his little, 
[00:05:00]  almost an internet radio show about New York radio.  Picks various subjects that have been popular on the board that week and runs with them.  He, he does this instead of taking care of his patients.  There's somebody sitting back there going, oh, Dr. Sniffen, can you come in here?  The notification is wearing off.  I'll be in in a minute.  I got to record my board reflections.  Wait a minute.  Just hold the cotton in your mouth till you choke. 
[00:05:30]  I got to do board reflections.  He's a, he's a psychopath.  I'm going to get a restraining order tomorrow.  The guy is out of his effing mind, eh?  So the, the, the recent one that he taped, I guess today.  By the way, there was a big discussion, uh, I, I hate to interrupt, but you know how we do this.  And now we're going back a little bit.  There was a big discussion on the board, uh, earlier this week because you and I, uh, uh,  played a tape segment of Jim Brewer at 6.30.  Right.  And, and they're bitching and complaining.  All kinds of speculation as to why we played it. 
[00:06:00]  Are we playing it because we're getting lazy?  Right.  Are we playing it because we got in trouble?  No, Alan.  Did we have something to do?  No, Alan, the reason we played it was because I had to take a big, hairy dump.  And I couldn't wait any longer.  Is it okay with you, you idiot?  Sometimes you get a little diarrhea.  Sometimes you can get, you can kind of hold it in until the end of the show.  But you know what?  I felt like, ugh, could get a little messy in here.  It's hurting.  We got this really good Brewer bit.  We'll play that.  I could go do my thing. 
[00:06:30]  You ass.  There you go.  Questions answered.  Know why we did it?  Because we can.  It's our show.  We'll do whatever the F we want, you douche.  Well, he recorded a board reflections, Opie, like he does every week.  And one of the subjects is O&A and their syndication.  And he kind of does it in a way where he pits us against another local radio host here in New York City  that has recently been syndicated, and he decides who is doing better as far as they're being syndicated. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  And the overall picture.  Right.  We will, oh, you will hear this, and you will laugh along.  And one thing that, can I interrupt you, Ed?  I had a question.  Are these all real subjects?  Really?  Just so everyone is on the same page and realizes how ridiculous this message board is  and how dweeby these guys are.  You got some subjects of some topics?  These are other New York radio board topics in recent days, right? 
[00:07:30]  This is just in the last couple weeks, okay?  Right.  These people need to get a life.  They discussed this week in 1988.  This week in 1988 was one of their topics.  All right.  Maybe something was going on that week.  They also discussed, at length, FCC ownership limits.  Ah, no, that was a hot topic.  Basically, that means should a company be allowed to own eight stations in one city or nine? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, stop.  Wow, my heart just started racing it when you said it.  Another topic they've been discussing.  WNBC at 75.  No, it's not.  It was 66.  Huh?  No, 75 years.  Oh, see, I thought you were discussing the frequency.  Their 75th anniversary, Anthony.  Wow.  Big discussion on Scott Muni Wednesdays.  Yeah.  Yeah, listen to Scott's on the way in.  In between my traffic on 1010 Winds. 
[00:08:30]  They also discussed, at length, the soda wars.  Soda wars?  Isn't that the episode before the Clone Wars of Star Wars?  Which one was the soda wars?  Boba Fett, right?  He gets soda.  I can't remember.  That has something to do with it.  Hey, guys, I hate to tell you this, but I think you need to go get laid.  Also, a discussion on Mets public announcer for 2002.  Oh, really?  Ugh.  This week in 1967, WNAW-FM. 
[00:09:00]  All-female lineup.  Discuss.  Discuss.  Comment.  Discuss.  Does anyone...  There's another topic.  Does anyone have tapes of jamming oldies?  Hmm.  This was an exclusive topic right here, Ant.  Exclusive WABC cuts.  New jingles.  New jingles.  Memories of WRVR.  WR.  Dude, I've been doing radio for half my life now. 
[00:09:30]  I don't even...  I couldn't even tell you what WRVR was.  And now they'll write on the board, save me.  Care.  Didn't make an impression in my life.  And then finally, WNYCFM and AM schedules are online now.  Former WEVDPD has new job.  That's a really good one.  Who cares?  There's...  And then, no one's so pathetic.  He's just as pathetic as Bill Riley and all these other tools... 
[00:10:00]  Bill Riley.  ...that try to trash our radio show, Ant.  Yeah.  You know, they say, you know, there's no spin and stuff like that, but they all have an agenda.  Yeah.  Our listeners have tried to get on that message board, and just about all of them get banned from the message board.  They get kicked off, yeah.  They get kicked off.  Yeah, they don't allow...  Because Alan Sniffen really doesn't care what you guys have to say.  Yeah.  So, anyway, you want to play some of this board reflection?  Well, I was going somewhere, and I've got to kind of remember how I was going with this. 
[00:10:30]  The thing, like I said, that he recorded this week is about us, syndication, and this other local radio personality here in New York that syndicated, Hannity.  Yeah, Sean Hannity.  And who is faring best in the overall picture as far as syndication goes?  Here's another...  I guess all it is as far as Alan is concerned is how he feels syndication is going for both shows. 
[00:11:00]  How he, his impression, because he bases it not one bit on fact.  On, give me a Sean Hannity success story in another market.  Do I believe Sean Hannity will be successful in other markets?  Sure.  The guy does the type of radio he does very well.  You know?  Will he be successful in other markets?  Sure.  But give me one right now.  Alan has decided right now he is going to make some kind of decision on who's doing better. 
[00:11:30]  We have some success stories there, Alan.  We have been syndicated.  A lot of people on your very message board said it wouldn't work.  He said the Opie and Anthony said, oh, well, okay, we're giving in to the fact that they're here in New York and it's working, but they'll never work in syndication.  Well, we have multiple success stories in syndication.  Philly, Boston, Cleveland, and Buffalo.  I'm going to say it, too.  Friggin' Washington.  And Washington showing some success.  You watch the book in Washington as opposed to our numbers when everybody fled afternoons when we showed up in Washington. 
[00:12:00]  Those are success stories.  They're numbers.  They're written down somewhere as record, not a dentist's opinion of whose program is doing better as far as being syndicated.  So we'll play and laugh along and stop the tape if we want to comment on Alan.  I want to thank Alan for giving us 20 minutes.  Giving us our first break. 
[00:12:30]  Thank you, Alan.  Really, we didn't know what we were going to do today.  Now get back to filling cavities.  Yeah, take an x-ray and scrape an old lady's teeth.  Could you take the next 1,500 x-rays without that lead suit you've got to wear?  All right, ready?  And he has a jingle and everything, proving this guy so badly wants to be doing what you and I are doing instead of, you know, scraping teeth.  All right, dentist's office somewhere.  Picture this, and I sure hope you all saw the king of comedy.  Remember how Rupert Pupkin in his basement had a talk show set up? 
[00:13:00]  Of course.  So he can come in, and he was making tapes down in his basement with the applause and sound effects, and he'd talk on it, and he'd be yelling,  Ma!  I'm trying to do something down here, Ma!  Rupert, what are you doing?  Ma!  Ma!  That is exactly how I picture Alan doing his board reflections.  Down there, he's got his effects.  Okay, I've got to get the jingle.  I'll get the jingle. 
[00:13:30]  I'll hit it.  And then I'll come in, hey!  With a bunch of energy like the good old days of music radio.  Here we go.  Hi, everybody.  This is Alan Sniffen, and it's time.  Are you ready?  Here's Alan Sniffen.  Hi.  With Bored Reflections.  Hi.  Bored Reflections for April 4, 2002.  Here's Tom, Luke.  Radio77.com.  Go, go.  That's right.  It's time for Bored Reflections, where I make comments about comments being made to the New York Radio Message Board, 
[00:14:00]  the mecca of all Internet Radio Message Boards.  Well, it's the tale of two recently syndicated shows.  On the one hand, you've got Opie and Anthony, and on the other hand, you have Sean Hannity.  One program is syndicated as an FM Extreme talk show.  The other is being syndicated as a conservative issues-oriented talk show.  I just want to step in for one second and say, please remember, everybody, this is a dentist.  This is a dentist talking, okay? 
[00:14:30]  That's all.  I just want to remind people of it.  Not some old legendary program director that has seen people come and go.  It's a dentist.  It's a dentist.  That does root canals.  A dentist.  Which one is succeeding and which one is not?  Well, I think you can make an argument that both are succeeding.  I mean, after all, neither of which has fallen off the cliff, so you can't really say that either one is failing.  So maybe the better question is, which one is succeeding more effectively than the other? 
[00:15:00]  Which is the better program as far as its listeners are concerned?  You know what?  You've got to put the finger on Sean Hannity as the more successful program right now.  And you've got to say that Opie and Anthony's show has suffered since it became syndicated.  Oh.  Eh.  Wrong.  Try again, jackass.  Has suffered since we've been syndicated.  Hmm.  That's why the underlying theme will be, you know, what has syndication done for this radio show?  What has syndication done for this show? 
[00:15:30]  Would you say the show has changed or evolved from when we first got here?  Oh, yeah.  I'll say absolutely.  I think we're doing a better show now than we were.  I absolutely believe that.  Is it different?  And this is a guy that I swear to you, I wish I could pull up, and maybe you can.  I don't know how far back the records go on this message board.  But this is the guy that's saying our show isn't as good now as it was based on what? 
[00:16:00]  The message board used to call us juvenile drivel that wouldn't last.  The show is horrid, horrific, no structure, whatever it was.  There was always a complaint two years ago about this show.  There they go.  Hey, there's a new topic on the New York Radio message board.  The new topic is, I drink beer till I pass out. 
[00:16:30]  I drink beer till I pass out.  Discuss.  Well, they've found, a couple of the people have found the board.  And another topic, O and A suck, and the first post, banana juice.  All right.  Want to move on here?  Now, I know many of you, or Opie and Anthony fans, don't want to hear that.  But you've got to concede that this show today, that is Opie and Anthony, is not as good as it was a year ago.  And that point is being made in places other than the New York Radio message board. 
[00:17:00]  And I have...  Oh, yeah?  Where, Alan?  Where?  Where's that?  Where's your...  Where, Alan?  Where's that that this show...  Other people are saying that.  Like, where, Alan?  ...isn't as good as, uh...  Where are they saying that?  As it was a year ago.  New York Post?  Daily News?  Where are they saying that, Alan?  Where is that?  Where's your proof?  Hmm.  And I hate to be the one that says, I told you so.  Oh, no, you don't.  But the fact is, I did tell you so.  Can someone make up a montage... 
[00:17:30]  I told you a year ago.  Be careful what you ask for, because you may get it.  Can someone make up a montage of every time Alan has said, I told you so?  I told you so.  I told you so.  Well, it was me on the New York radio message board that told you all that this was going  to happen.  Spit, please.  Could you rinse?  There we go.  I was there telling you that this would happen.  Bike down.  Bike down.  Okay.  I am the one. 
[00:18:00]  Please.  And the truth is that syndicating a show rarely helps the local show.  The best you can say is it hasn't hurt the local show, but it rarely helps the local  show.  And frequently, it hurts the local show.  Some guys are obeying on sweet air.  I think you can argue that since it became syndicated, the show is not as good in New York.  Now he's going to give some examples.  All right.  This is going to drive our faithful listeners nuts. 
[00:18:30]  Dan from Hoboken said, Alan is right.  The show today is worse because I have to listen to Alan sniffing.  Now maybe people in Boston and maybe people in Philadelphia and maybe people in other markets  think it's a terrific show, but compared to what it was here a year or two years ago, it's  not as good for what Opie and Anthony try to do in terms of radio, which is generate a  lot of buzz, generate publicity, do outlandish stuff, get people to talk about them. 
[00:19:00]  That's what they were doing unbelievably well a year, two years, even three years ago.  A really good job of that.  Alan, you douchebag.  In the last week, we were on MTV, VH1, and Bill O'Reilly's huge special on Fox about corrupting  the youth of America.  You ass.  Daily News.  They're the facts.  The Post here in New York multiple times over the past few weeks.  Well, in the Daily News today, again, you idiot. 
[00:19:30]  And Alan, at any time, I swear to you, at any time, we can go outside of this studio, write  the C word on a sign, and hold it in front of a live remote.  We've done that already.  We do other things.  We move on.  And as I've said in the past, the show evolves.  It moves on.  We get new characters in.  Some of the old characters fade away.  It's a constantly evolving program. 
[00:20:00]  And are there people out there that would say, are there New Yorkers out there that would  listen to the show and say, yeah, I don't like it as much as I did a year ago, two years  ago?  Sure.  Of course.  They're going to say that regardless of syndication or anything.  I don't care if he says it, but get your facts right.  It's the nature of the beast.  That's what happens.  But, on the other hand, there are plenty of people that would say, I listened to the  show then.  I listened to it now.  I kind of like it now.  We're more comfortable with the talk format that we hadn't done prior.  We never did a talk show before this. 
[00:20:30]  And that's why I'm saying I truly like what we're doing now better than I do what we were  doing a couple of years back.  But to say that we're not generating any buzz.  Yeah, I know.  Alan, wait.  That made no sense.  Alan, in the last week, we've created a major buzz.  We're the talk of the whole music industry today.  A lot of people angry.  People just losing their minds because of what we did with the Korn thing.  It made MTV.  It made VH1.  It's now on, it's all over the internet now.  The story's going everywhere. 
[00:21:00]  We debuted five tracks for the new Korn CD.  That was a really big deal.  Yeah.  They were able to single-handedly keep WNEW going.  When the rest of the station was in the dumper.  Which it still pretty much is.  Well, yeah.  We'll give you that one.  All right.  Wait a minute, Alan.  All right, Bane.  We'll be fair.  All right.  You got one.  I like that.  Play still blows real bad here in New York.  Rinse.  Very good. 
[00:21:30]  We'll give you that one.  But now, their one successful show is not as good as it used to be.  In whose opinion?  Alan, we're still number one in all the demos that matter, you idiot.  If you're going to be, quote, an expert, why don't you use some facts?  It's all public knowledge.  We are hired.  We were hired to be number one men, 18 of 49.  We've been number one for, I can't even tell you how many books in a row, Alan. 
[00:22:00]  It goes up.  It goes down.  But the ranking always stays the same.  We're still number one.  Before we came to New York, Mike and the Mad Dog were the top dogs in afternoon radio.  No one even talks about them anymore.  They stink.  And no one has been able to knock us off, you know, the top of the hill here.  And we're number one in a million other demos, but I'm not going to bore you with that.  The one that really matters is 18 of 49. 
[00:22:30]  Rob from Jersey says, the way syndication has helped the O&A show.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to do this all day today.  Yeah.  Number one, Alan Sniffen exposed as a complete douchebag in 18 cities now.  Yes.  And you want to blame it on something?  You can blame it on syndication.  Now, they're going to argue, oh, no, not true.  September 11th had a lot to do with it.  And you know what?  I can't totally argue that point.  There is some truth to that.  September 11th certainly did hurt shows like Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  At the same time, it did help shows like Sean Hannity.  After all, you've got an overriding current event that has got everybody's attention.  A program that focuses on that is likely going to do better.  So, yeah, there's some truth to that.  Duh.  Alan, no one wanted to laugh after September 11th.  You know, we were put in a position where we had to do very serious radio.  And I'm pretty proud of ourselves.  I think we did a really good job.  But for a long time, people really weren't into this type of radio. 
[00:23:30]  People's listening habits changed drastically after the 11th.  Another thing you could prove by just looking at the ratings, Alan.  Look at the ratings like people in radio, not in dentistry.  Look at the ratings.  You'll see after September 11th, news stations went through the roof.  News stations went insane.  News-oriented talk like Sean Hannity.  Insane ratings through the roof. 
[00:24:00]  Spike you could see by looking at it.  It was September 11th.  Bam.  Spike.  And then, you know what happens?  It doesn't, after a week or two, spike back down to where it was.  If you look at the ratings, you'll see it.  It's a gradual drop-off to a normal ratings like we had before the 11th.  People gradually go back to what they were doing before.  They gradually go back to their listening habits.  Alan, if you'd bother to do your homework in the last ratings trend that just came out only two weeks ago, 
[00:24:30]  we're kicking Sean Hannity's ass again.  Right.  You idiot.  So look at that.  Look at the fact that we're now beating Hannity.  Because of 9-11, Sean Hannity, for the first time, beat us in the ratings.  Right.  And we weren't too happy about it, but there was really nothing we could do.  What are you going to do?  People wanted to talk about 9-11.  I understand that.  You know?  But the last trend, Alan, that just came out, guess what?  It's going back to where it was pre-9-11.  Yeah.  It doesn't all of a sudden turn back to what it was before 9-11. 
[00:25:00]  But still, here we are now.  We're more than six months since September 11th.  And listening patterns are returning to normal in that radio stations that appeal to adult music listeners  have been picking up in ratings recently, which implies that the adult audience that flipped over to news stations  and to talk stations is now moving back to where they used to be prior to September 11th.  So do you think Opie and Anthony are doing as well as they were prior to September 11th? 
[00:25:30]  I don't think so.  I don't think their show was as good as it used to be.  I think they've got too many people on there that don't belong on the show.  The best part of Opie and Anthony is when the two of them are on, dealing with the callers, or dealing with each other.  I don't think they need Jim Norton in the studio.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Alan.  Oh, Alan.  You don't appreciate Jim Norton's humor?  You hurt Jimmy's feelings.  Too bad Jim's not here yet.  Damn.  Jim Norton has helped this show tremendously. 
[00:26:00]  But he loved Jimmy.  He's just kind of one of the guys now that hangs out.  It's not the Opie and Anthony Jim Norton show.  We like having him around.  Yeah, he's not helping the radio show.  He's only sold out shows in every city we're syndicated to, practically.  Yeah.  Or at least the ones he's, you know, has decided to go into.  Yeah, quite frankly, no one really knew who Jim was or us in these cities before we got there.  Jim told me in Philadelphia, he goes, if I wasn't on the radio show, I wouldn't even be selling out the local comedy club that seats 75 people. 
[00:26:30]  Instead, in Philly, he did five sold out shows at the TLA.  Yeah.  That's proof that not only is he a very funny guy and a really good comedian, that the show has a little heat.  Mm-hmm.  A little power.  Alan.  Uh-oh, I'm seeing now they're deleting some of the posts on the message board.  So some poor son of a bitch is sitting there in the dentist's chair waiting for a film. 
[00:27:00]  And Alan's like, I'll be right back.  I gotta edit my message board.  And Alan, stop listening to this.  You got patience to take care of, you idiot.  I don't think Jim Brewer brings anything to the table.  I don't...  All right, keep going.  Is this guy insane?  Is he insane?  He doesn't think Brewer or...  Another one.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to go back, though.  Okay.  The guy's insane.  Because I got a point to bring up on this line.  Brewer has...  This contradiction.  Brewer has never... 
[00:27:30]  Brewer is, I would say, the only comedian we've had on the show that has never had a bad appearance.  Every single time he's been on our show, he's killed.  Yep.  The best part of Opie and Anthony is when the two of them are on dealing with the callers or dealing with each other.  Yes.  I don't think they need Jim Norton in the studio.  I don't think Jim Brewer brings anything to the table.  I don't think Jay Moore brings anything to the table.  All right.  Can I call you out now for being...  For completely contradicting yourself? 
[00:28:00]  The show is better.  Let me think.  The show was better a year ago, two years ago, he says, when pretty much Jay Moore was in here on a daily basis.  Pretty much the listeners called it the Opie, Anthony, and Jay Moore show.  The Opie Moore show, and Brewer made more appearances on our show back then than he does now.  Unfortunately, we would love to have him on here more.  So, you're contradicting yourself.  What?  And Brewer is... 
[00:28:30]  I mean, classic stuff.  Brewer doesn't bring anything to the show.  God, are you out of touch.  Sorry to tell you, Alan, we're not going back to ABC Radio anytime soon.  Or standards.  With cute little jingles, and the jocks get to talk for 20 seconds.  Too much time on the phone with these guys.  Too much time in the studio.  Too much time for self-promotion, which is what the three of those guys seem to be mostly into.  And not enough about the radio show itself.  The show is not as good as it used to be. 
[00:29:00]  Now, it may also be true that there are other issues here.  And some of those issues include syndicated stations maybe not wanting the show to be as close to the edge as it used to be.  Ehhh...  Please.  The syndicated markets have no say in the show.  We have to deal with dopey asswipe dump guy down the hall, but we've always had that problem.  When it was a WNEW-only show, it may not be their fault.  They may be doing what their affiliates want them to do, which is to be a less controversial show in order to keep the show on the air and not take advertisers off. 
[00:29:30]  All of those things may be true, but all of those things are a consequence of syndication.  And all of you people who kept calling up on the phone and repeating after them,  Syndication now!  I hope you're happy!  Did you get what you wanted?  Is this really working out for you?  Yes, it is.  Syndication now!  Yes, it is.  If it wasn't for syndication, we wouldn't have Frenchie going at it with Tom from New Orleans. 
[00:30:00]  Joy's saying, can I ask, who's he yelling at?  Is this a way of making it seem right in his own twisted mind?  Yeah, he does.  He is yelling.  Imagine, like, the sounds coming through the door where he's doing this.  People walk him by going, this is a dentist's office.  I thought he was going in there to look at x-rays.  He's going into the x-ray room.  He's going to look at the x-rays.  I'm waiting here in the seat to get my tooth filled, and I hear my dentist yelling at somebody  in another room. 
[00:30:30]  Come on!  He sounds like Lycus.  Do they do root canals on brains?  He's a pissed-off dentist.  It's working out well for them.  They're making a lot of money here, so congratulations.  Tip your hat.  You've got to give them credit.  Heck.  A lot of credit.  How do you know how much money we're making, Alan?  It was reported in the Daily News and Post.  Oh, we all know that's accurate.  A lot of money being made on Opie and Anthony by the two people who are running the show.  Good for them.  I don't begrudge them one cent.  Don't begrudge me.  My criticism, however, is that as far as New York is concerned, as far as WNEW is concerned, 
[00:31:00]  this show is not as good as it used to be.  Based on...  Just like I told you it wouldn't be.  This is what happens when you syndicate.  Now, I'm not calling this show a total failure.  Thank you, Alan.  I'm not saying that it won't succeed.  And I'm not arguing that Infinity is going to give up on it, because I don't think they  are, because they're making more money by syndicating the show than not syndicating the show. 
[00:31:30]  So, from their point of view, it is a success.  But in terms of you, the average New York radio listener, do you think the show was as  good as it used to be?  Is that rhetorical, or are we supposed to answer it?  No, I'm going to answer it.  Yeah, I think it is.  Yeah.  Yep.  The answer is obvious.  Now, the other show that got syndicated at about the same...  Want to keep going, or have you heard enough?  I don't know.  It goes on for another three and a half minutes. 
[00:32:00]  It just goes on and on.  Was there something else in here?  I don't know.  ...time that is doing much better, it seems to me, is Sean Hannity.  Much better.  And I...  Based on...  Based on...  Give me a success story.  Give me a success story about Sean Hannity and syndication.  Like I said, I'll give the guy credit.  He...  I believe he absolutely will do well in syndication.  But give me one right now.  You're making your little speech here on it? 
[00:32:30]  You can't.  This is your opinion.  This is Alan's opinion.  Mac, what's going on?  It's Mark.  By the way...  Oh, sorry.  I can picture that dude, like, yelling into an unconscious patient's mouth right now.  And he's got it, like, pumping out through the speakers in the waiting room.  They're, like, his only listeners.  They'll come out of that little haze that you're in after you have the sweet ass time to go.  With the dental dam spread over your mouth?  Was he yelling at me?  Dry blood in his hair?  Great.  Was he yelling at me?  Thank you, bro. 
[00:33:00]  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Tom.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  You guys are playing right into his hands.  This guy wants exposure, and you're giving him exposure.  He's a moron.  It's not good exposure, though.  I don't care.  That's fine.  I love playing this stuff so you guys can hear what people think of this radio show.  It's ridiculous in how they contradict themselves.  He can't get a radio show himself.  You're giving it to him.  Well, it's his opinion.  Yeah, I know.  Which, by the way, again, it's his opinion of our program. 
[00:33:30]  He doesn't think it's as good as it was.  But the was, the way the show was that he keeps talking about was better.  And it's plainly and clearly his opinion is a show that he didn't like.  That he said was horrible.  That him and his cronies on that same message board said wouldn't last.  But he was an infantile, horrid program.  He and his cronies, they don't like anything current or new. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  So even this show was better in the past.  They like everything.  Everything has to be in the past.  Even this show.  So he'll even discuss and say that we were better five minutes ago,  as long as it wasn't current.  Right.  He's out of his mind.  And I think part of the reason for that, again, is because of September 11th,  because he is an issues-oriented talk show host.  He did pick up on a lot of people who were looking for discussion of the events of September 11th, 
[00:34:30]  and he got syndicated at the right time for people to be looking for that.  That's just the way it worked out.  So he has been a beneficiary of circumstances, where Opie and Anthony have been a victim of it.  So things do happen that are beyond the control of the people doing the programs.  It's just the way it worked out.  But the truth is-  That is a true point, right?  All right.  Well, are we giving him that?  We are kind of victims.  He had two bells.  Well, we're okay with that.  We're fine with it.  We're back on track now.  Because Hannity is doing better. 
[00:35:00]  He's getting picked up on more stations.  All right.  Hold on.  This is true, too.  And the same thing happened to Bill O'Reilly, because it's safe programming.  Yeah.  Going into syndication, Ant and I knew we're an edgy show, constantly living on the edge.  Uphill battle.  You've got to listen every day, because you truly don't know what the hell is going to happen.  Maybe we'll get fired.  Maybe whatever.  You know what I'm saying?  And it's a tougher show to sell, yes.  So you don't get as many markets.  But that's okay with Ant and I.  We don't need a lot of markets.  Stations are adding him.  He recently got added to WLS in Chicago. 
[00:35:30]  I think that starts next week.  And they canceled Dr. Laura to do it, which, as far as I am concerned, is a terrific idea.  Dr. Laura had to be one of the worst talk show hosts I ever heard.  How she ever became as successful as she did was beyond me.  She wasn't compelling.  She wasn't interesting.  She wasn't a dentist.  She basically told everybody who called on the telephone to grow up.  That was her whole shtick.  One thing.  Hey, you big baby, grow up.  Stop bitching and moaning.  Be a big person.  Grow up.  That was her whole thing. 
[00:36:00]  That's what you said to every single person who ever called that show.  Wow.  He just made a lot of good points there, huh?  Brought his average up there.  It's getting neck and neck now between him and us, eh?  So it was amazing to me that it was successful as it was for as long as it was.  But that being said, as far as Hannity is concerned, he is not a one-trick pony.  He is talking most current events.  He has managed to tap into the weight.  And we're a one-trick pony, Alan?  I guess so. 
[00:36:30]  Just like Bill O'Reilly, you scumbags.  And not as good.  It's so easy just to say there's a one-trick pony radio show.  All they talk about is TNA.  If you listen on a daily basis, you know that's not true, you idiot.  But it's so easy just to say that.  Just throw it out there.  Like Bill O'Reilly said, obviously they only have one thing on their minds.  As we're talking about boobs that day.  People feel around the country, at least for the time being.  And he's doing well as a consequence of it.  Hannity is doing better, relatively speaking, than Opie and Anthony in terms of picking up number of radio stations and picking up a prospective audience out there. 
[00:37:00]  What?  What?  I'm Alan.  Here, I'll teach a little lesson today, okay?  Sean Hannity will have a ton more stations in syndication than Anthony and I.  We know that going into this.  Because the business is filled with a bunch of pussies.  It's a lot easier.  A bunch of people that are scared of this type of programming and don't have the balls or the know-how to sell this type of programming. 
[00:37:30]  It's safer.  Frankly, radio in general has become very homogenized and boring.  Because you've got general managers out there that would rather just sell very safe programming.  We already know that.  But as far as he goes, that he's more successful already.  No, he's not.  In getting an audience?  Why?  Give me a city, besides New York, where he's doing well.  Give me a success story. 
[00:38:00]  Come on.  He does sound like he likes us.  Again, some of that is due to circumstances.  He hit it at the right time, which was nobody's planning.  It just worked out that way.  But nevertheless, he's doing better.  Now, in terms of WABC, do I think Hannity is as good as he used to be on WABC itself?  No, I do not, frankly.  Whoa.  I think Hannity sounds better on WABC relative to the way he used to sound than Opie and Anthony do on WNEW relative to the way they used to sound. 
[00:38:30]  Carry the X, and then you divide by what?  What kind of net problem?  What formula was that?  He sounds better relative to who, what?  How he used to sound than we sound better to when we used to sound.  More gooder.  What?  So he, so Sean Hannity is more gooder.  More gooder, but not as good as he used to be.  But relative to us, more gooder.  Sean Hannity, more gooder than us now, but not as good as he used to be. 
[00:39:00]  Just pull the tooth.  So, in other words, I don't think syndication has hurt Hannity's show anywhere near as much as it seems to have hurt Opie and Anthony's show.  I don't think Hannity's doing as good a local show as he did when he was only on in New York.  I mean, I don't know how you could ever think otherwise.  He's not doing as good of a show, Alan, because the 9-11 thing is not in front of everyone's faces anymore.  That's why you could put a monkey on the radio after 9-11. 
[00:39:30]  They would give you good radio, you dick.  If he were, it would be incredible for Hannity to be doing as well in terms of his New York audience as far as things he talks about.  For him to do that, it would be a total turn-off to everybody else in the country.  So he's got to keep the show more national and focused.  Recently, that's been okay because that's where the big issues have been on a national level with September 11th.  However, that being said, still, I think Hannity is more true to the way he sounded before syndication than Opie and Anthony are. 
[00:40:00]  So it's an interesting study in terms of radio syndication, a tale of two radio shows, which is succeeding and which is succeeding better.  Because I don't think either one are a failure, but I do think in terms of the New York audience that the difficulty, the onus, the hurting of syndication has been more dramatic on Opie and Anthony than on Sean Hannity.  So, you know what?  It's an interesting thing, but I'll tell you something. 
[00:40:30]  Nobody from a local audience should ever want their favorite show to get syndicated.  It always hurts the local show.  Again, I think Hannity's doing a pretty good job, and it hasn't made a big impact on him, but it's made some.  But in terms of Opie and Anthony, come on.  The show is not what it used to be.  Careful what you ask for.  You may actually get it.  All I ask for is a filling, and I've been sitting here for three hours. 
[00:41:00]  Opie, I've got to thank Bobby from Queens, who went back in the Radio Message Board archives.  Okay.  And picked January 1st, 2000, Allen's Predictions.  You know where he always goes, I told you so.  I don't want to tell you I told you so, but here it is.  He's always been wrong, by the way.  Here's his predictions.  In the end, he's always wrong.  For NEW, the station here in New York, here's his predictions.  Opie and Anthony to mornings.  Yes, I know this can hurt Stern, but I think Infinity needs to take a gamble here. 
[00:41:30]  So he predicts you and I to mornings.  We were going to go to mornings.  My guess is Stern won't be heard at all that much, and WNEW will go up in the AM drive to around a 2.5.  The station will then bring in a new person or team to PM drive.  Wait, wait.  So we go to mornings, and then some new team comes in for afternoons.  In the less competitive time of afternoons, it will give NEW a chance to develop another show with a real following.  Something it desperately needs to do.  And mornings isn't the place to break new voices in. 
[00:42:00]  Mason and Kalinsky proved that much.  Leica stays.  The radio chick stays.  The station will try to develop some weekend talk programming.  None of this happens until a new PD is named.  Soon.  All wrong.  Not one thing right about this station, Alan.  I don't want to say I told you so, but I can't.  Right from your message board.  Not one thing in here is true. 
[00:42:30]  Good job, Alan.  There you go.  Good job.  Good job, Alan.  Now get back to scraping old ladies' teeth.  Still a tooth.  Teeths.  Wouldn't it be teeth?  Yeah.  All right.  Ah, ah, ah.  Here we go.  Ah, ah, ah.  Alan Sniffen's answer.  Hey, ONA, your ratings are lower in New York than before syndication.  Fact.  That's all I need.  That's all the support I need. 
[00:43:00]  But, hey, nice to know my opinion is so important to you.  Gotcha.  No, you didn't.  We just made you look like a tool to 18 cities.  The truth hurts.  Alan, number one is still number one.  And the ratings have always, always with this show, gone up and down.  Up and down.  Alan, number one is still number one.  You idiot. 
[00:43:30]  Look at you.  You're a dentist and you're listening to us today instead of taking care of your patients.  Is there a new Wesley Willis song?  Rock and roll dentist.  Rock and roll dentist.  Rock and roll dentist.  Rock and roll dentist.  Rock and roll dentist.  All right, Anthony.  Lots to do today.  There you go.  Wow.  We went really long.  Ooh.  Ben's going to kill us.  Ouch.  Tomorrow, we're broadcasting live in Boston. 
[00:44:00]  Uh-huh.  Another thing that syndication gave us, people eating puke.  I hope...  Say it's this kind of stuff.  There's an underlying theme to the show today.  Yeah.  What has syndication given this radio show?  There's another one.  People eating puke, thanks to Boston.  How about Hot Melissa from Philly?  Oh, all those Sacramento girls.  How about all the hot pieces of asses all over the country from the Naughty Nighty Contest? 
[00:44:30]  How about Tim Sabian and his tight slacks?  Tom.  Tom from New Orleans.  New Orleans Tom.  Goddamn.  Hey, boys.  Syndication brought us Jim Norton, matter of fact.  We couldn't hire him before syndication.  Right.  They didn't have it in the budget, my friends.  So that'll be an underlying theme, okay?  There you go.  So think of other things.  Yeah, we're going to be in Boston tomorrow, broadcasting live from WBCN.  And this is going to be really cool, Anthony. 
[00:45:00]  What is the wildest or strangest thing you could bring to WBCN?  Because we know everyone hangs out outside the studio while we broadcast.  And there's one big party.  So here's the deal.  What's the wildest or strangest thing you could bring to WBCN tomorrow while we're broadcasting live?  The winner, chosen by you and I, Anthony, will win a trip to see MTV Icon starring Aerosmith in L.A.  Oh, in L.A.?  This is a huge deal.  And what's different about this trip we're giving away? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  It includes a flight.  Oh, it does.  Yes.  You don't have to get yourself to L.A.  Unlike the Super Bowl?  No.  We gave Super Bowl tickets, but we had no flight.  This time around, you get to go on an airplane.  Oh, how great is that?  You get to go on an airplane and fly.  Hopefully not out of Logan Airport, though.  Maybe we could send our winner down to Providence and take a flight out of there.  But there you go.  Wildest or strangest thing you could bring to WBCN tomorrow while we're broadcasting live? 
[00:46:00]  The winner will win a trip to see MTV Icon starring Aerosmith in L.A.  I mean, just think of the craziest thing.  It's wide open, man.  Bring it down.  It could be an exotic animal.  It could be a person, a celebrity.  It could be just something you have in your house, whatever.  Something that we just go, oh, my God.  We could give an example.  We actually had somebody bring up into this very studio a Siberian tiger. 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  And that was a little much.  Yes.  But something like that.  It's not only animals, Anthony.  We don't want people to start thinking, well, it's the wildest or strangest.  Right, right.  It's the wildest or strangest thing.  If you want to dress up your patch like Yasha.  No, that was our second idea.  That was our second idea.  But that would be something cool and kind of odd to bring down to the studio.  We have to start taping ourselves in the office because, you know, Chachi from BCN and Oedipus,  they give us a call and they say, hey, man, we got this great trip to go to L.A. to see the Aerosmith thing, you know. 
[00:47:00]  So now we've got to come up with something, you know.  And they only gave us this trip maybe an hour ago.  Yeah.  So now we're brainstorming.  That's when we have to roll tape.  The idea that we said no to was have girls come down with their patch, their whole area, dressed up like Yasha Arafat.  Because we noticed in the newspaper the other day they had a real ultra close-up of Arafat's face. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And his whiskers look very pubelike.  Yes.  Very pubelike.  Yeah.  So if any ladies, we wanted ladies to come down with their patched, dressed up like Arafat.  The one that looked most like Arafat.  Well, we had the picture from the paper.  Yeah.  And we were going to compare, like, which lady's peach looks the most like Arafat's facial hair.  Imagine that, though.  They maybe use a magic marker for some eyes and stuff. 
[00:48:00]  And then a little piece of tablecloth glued to the upper region for that rag he wears on his head.  Yeah.  And then just the stray scraggly hairs.  Hell, who are we to say no?  If ladies want to come down and do that tomorrow as well, please.  We'll bring you right in.  We'll take a look.  And I'm sure Chachi will have some presents, some prizes laying around the joint that he could give away from the secret room.  A little sideline contest going on.  Yeah.  So, ladies, show up with your patch dressed up like Yasa Arafat.  But that's not going to determine the winner for the trip to L.A. 
[00:48:30]  So, once again, tomorrow at WBCN when we're broadcasting live, what is the wildest or strangest thing you could bring to WBCN for a trip to CMTV icon starring Aerosmith in L.A.?  Yep.  Just show up at WBCN tomorrow between 3 and 7, 1265 Boylston Street in Boston.  All right?  All right.  All right, and on the show today, we're going to finally get to the top five things.  Guys are doing wrong and bad.  The ladies will help us out with that.  Nothing.  We got to talk about the black man game. 
[00:49:00]  This is how syndication helped us.  We're like, holy S, there's so many effing people listening to us.  We actually prepare for the show now.  We never had little notes in front of us with actual things we were going to talk about, Alan.  Also, the Vegas promo, yeah.  We got to talk about the Titanic ride collapsing.  New developments in that, by the way, Opie.  Yeah.  I'm keeping tabs on it.  I look into the news now.  And when we get back, I think Steve, our Steve is a thinner Steve.  Oh, he's got it? 
[00:49:30]  He's got more raw audio as Ant and I try to muddle through a spot.  As we try to re-record the sweet release.  Yeah.  Commercial.  They re-wrote it.  And something else.  So, where's the other one?  Sure.  Too long for a car.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  So, we got lots to do.  We'll do the outtakes from our commercial production stuff next.  Roll it.  Rain wreck radio.  Like a bunch of people cheering on a rake.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Opie, Stump, Anthony, Slime. 
[00:50:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Sorry about that.  To the faithful listeners.  Yeah.  We do 55 minutes of radio.  That's what happens.  Then we got to lump all our commercials together.  Sorry.  Apologize.  Speaking of commercials, Lindsay.  Oh, it's a guy.  Lindsay.  Yo.  What a horrible name.  Not really.  I mean, I had to fight over it a little growing up, but it's cool. 
[00:50:30]  What do they call you, though?  They call me Lindsay or Linz.  Linz.  Linz.  Can you imagine?  Hey, Linz.  That's a faggot name if I ever heard one.  What are you going to do?  If I could have named myself, I would have done it differently.  Beat up.  I hate my name, so I've been Opie since, it seemed like a good idea when I was 12.  Now I'm in my 30s.  Now I first heard about you guys, I thought you were like the little rascal growing up  or whoever that was. 
[00:51:00]  I hate the name.  Hate it.  Would love to go back to my regular name, but it's, you know, I've been doing radio with  this name for way too long.  Yeah, it's called a trademark.  It would be stupid to change now, but anyway, a guy with a girl's name, what do you have  today?  Well, no, I mean, I was listening to you guys do that read, and literally, I mean, that  was cringe radio beyond cringe radio.  I was curled up in the fetal position on my floor, cringing and screaming.  So the next time you run that, if you want to put me on in the background, I bet I could  outdo your, it's torture, it's torture, by miles. 
[00:51:30]  You're talking about the live read for Sweet Release.  Yeah, you have that.  Yeah, it's our latest client, and we're having some serious problems with our latest client.  With the copy, though.  Yeah, you know, the guy, it seems cool.  Something tells me you guys are going to need your own radio station sooner or later.  He's a friend of Tim Sabian, the guy that loves his slacks a little tighter.  How close of friends are they?  They tasted each other?  I don't know, man.  No?  I don't know.  We're going to have to get Tim on the phone one of these days to talk about Sweet Release. 
[00:52:00]  Maybe they're using the Sweet Release.  Never mind.  All right, Lindsey, thank you.  Later.  Yeah, so they gave us this copy for this Sweet Release.  It's a website, sweetrelease.com.  Yeah.  It's supposed to make your byproduct of sex taste better.  Yes.  Yours and I guess the female is supposed to taste better or something.  And the male, you know, the product.  It's all well and good.  It's supposed to taste better.  It's all well and good. 
[00:52:30]  We're whores.  If you want to advertise on our show, so be it.  But the problem is they want us to do the live read as two guys talking about guys' brr.  Yeah.  And what it tastes like after using this product.  So hopefully you were listening yesterday.  We went through the whole process.  You know, we had the first script they gave us.  And that's the spot they're running.  That was a goof read.  And they're like, oh, that's good.  We'll play that.  No.  They cut out all the parts where we're goofing around and try to pull it off like we read it like that.  And if that don't sound gay, completely gay. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  Totally gay.  So we told sales that we need a new script.  Yeah.  You know, something that maybe doesn't make us sound so gay.  Something that we don't really have to discuss the taste of man juice.  Right.  You know?  Right.  We don't ask for much with this show.  That's all.  We don't want to talk about the taste of man juice.  We really don't have attitudes.  We don't have big heads around here.  Silly us.  Well, we're kind of putting our foot down with this sweet release thing. 
[00:53:30]  Uh-huh.  It's got to be a...  The copy has to be written just right.  So the client gets what he wants from his advertising dollars.  Right.  And you and I don't look like homos.  So we've got to kind of figure something out here.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  You know, I mean, ideally, instead of having Opie and Anthony do your spot, why don't you  have a chick do it?  Have a girl read it with a hot voice.  You've got some funky-tasting spot.  Exactly. 
[00:54:00]  That's why you need.  Yeah.  That might work.  But the client is so excited that he's on the Opie and Anthony show and he wants you  and I to read his commercial.  No.  It's not working.  No.  So, Steve, just before the show, all excitedly comes running up to us and goes, guys, I got  the new copy for sweet release.  Yeah.  Jeremy and I, we worked on this all night and we think we finally got something that you  guys could read and feel good about.  Sure.  Sure they did.  So, we should explain, too. 
[00:54:30]  We do our commercial reads in parts.  Separate.  You think it sounds like me and Opie are hanging out, talking to each other during these reads?  No.  Opie was in production.  I was playing EverQuest in the office.  Right.  That was pretty much it.  Right.  Then I get done.  I come up here and Steve drags me in to do my parts.  And then he cuts it all together with the computer.  Yeah.  That's why the hot wire spot sounds so weird.  That's why it sounds like that.  We're not even in the same room. 
[00:55:00]  I think I recorded my parts in, I don't know, Philly and you were in L.A. or something.  Yes.  I flew the Concord over to record.  You know?  There's got to be a chick involved in this commercial, but they don't get it.  That's what I said.  They don't get it.  So, here's me attempting the new script, Anthony.  All right.  All right.  No, Opie loves doing these anyway.  No, because right away I'm like, no, I'm not doing it.  I know.  Because for once I proofread. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  And I go, no, I'm not doing this.  And Steve's like, why?  Why not?  We worked on it all night.  And now here's my explanation.  I understand it, but how else do you...  I ain't saying there is sweet, delicious taste and scent coming from within.  How else do you word it?  That means I've tasted...  I'm not doing it.  Now, the most intimate acts are even better because there's a sweet, delicious taste and scent coming from within.  Why should that excite me?  Why the f*** should I be excited?  Because someone out there has got sweet, delicious... 
[00:56:00]  You think of a f***ing PC way to say sweet...  I mean...  I don't need to describe it.  There's...  Now the most intimate acts are even better because there's a sweet, delicious taste and scent coming from within.  And why should I f***ing care?  I sound like a homo.  Not doing it.  Rewrite number three.  C***. 
[00:56:30]  And Steve's all bummed.  Gee, I know.  Steve's trying to...  Well, is there some way we can work this out?  He's being the responsible one.  You know, I'm not...  He's trying to broker it.  I'm not out of line on this.  So then Anthony goes in to cut his lines for the same script.  And now Anthony is seeing the script for the first time.  Yes.  Ready?  For years you've been hearing about products that make sex safer and products that help you perform better.  Now get set.  Here comes the ultimate. 
[00:57:00]  A product that makes it more incredible.  It's called Sweet Release and simply put, it adds the taste and scent of succulent fruit to your pleasure.  The manufacturer promises that the female formula is a delicious, soft citrus flavor.  And the men's formula...  Oh, here.  Now I gotta f***ing read this.  And the men's formula is like a crisp, hard apple.  I know.  I've sucked f***ing.  Didn't we ask them to rewrite this?  Can you figure out another way to reword it?  Reword it another way so it sounds like I swallowed f***ing. 
[00:57:30]  The men's formula...  I have no clue.  Don't want to know what it tastes like.  No, I have no idea.  How would you reword it?  I sat here with Jeremy.  We tried to figure out a piecey way to reword sweet tasting.  You know what?  Get a f***ing girl in here that pops in and goes,  and the men's formula makes this f***ing taste like an apple.  And I go, that's right, chick, girl, whatever.  Me and Opie are not reading about men's f***ing tasting like anything. 
[00:58:00]  But that's what the product is.  I'm very happy for the people that made the product.  Yeah, I know, but how do you, you know, if they're...  Call 1-800-310-2984.  Visit them on the web, sweetrelease.com.  1-800-310-2984.  Or on the web, sweetrelease.com.  Get a girl in here to do this.  They really should use a girl.  Girls are the ones that suck f***, not guys.  Hello?  Because then I'm outside the door and I had a buzz thing because it's just like your face. 
[00:58:30]  I know.  I can't.  So, the saga continues.  They're going to try rewrite number three, Anthony.  I think it should be a girl.  I'm going to go out on a limb.  I think they're going to find a chick.  Yeah.  That's the best idea.  That works here.  And they're going to have a few lines in the spot, Anthony.  Either that or it's going to be Steve and Jim reading it Hooters style like they do  with their so many of those action-packed buddy...  It's like one of those buddy movies. 
[00:59:00]  Wait, no.  Hey, we're going to Hooters.  That's right, Jim.  Where they have great wings and beer and beer.  Even better, though.  Even better, Steve and Jim Norton did a goof read for that Dream Cream.  Yeah.  This was really the copy for the Dream Cream.  But we had Steve and Jim do it as a gay couple.  Whoa, Jim.  That was incredible.  I know.  You were as hot as our first time. 
[00:59:30]  Mm-hmm.  Do you remember how passionate our lovemaking was back then?  Oh, Mark, I know.  But lately, I haven't felt, well, in the mood.  Is something wrong?  No, actually, I'm normal.  Most men experience a lack of sexual desire from time to time.  But my brother told me about Dream Cream.  What's that?  It's an all-natural cream with this breakthrough ingredient that's been proven to enhance sexual  pleasure for men.  Mm-hmm.  And it's available without a prescription.  So I ordered some.  How's it work?  Well, I applied one little fingertip full and Dream Cream made my skin more sensitive to 
[01:00:00]  touch.  Mm-hmm.  I was so aroused.  Mm-hmm.  My sexual pleasure was so intense.  Mm-hmm.  It's lubricating, tasteless, and odorless, so it doesn't interfere, and it works almost  instantly.  You're telling me.  Come on, cuddle up over here and let's see what happens next.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Oh!  God, that last moan that Norton does makes me rich.  It makes me physically sick.  Mm-hmm.  Which moan is worse, Jim Norton moaning there or Jay Moore on the beginning of Moore Sports  the other night?  I'm not going to answer that. 
[01:00:30]  Either answer's wrong.  That's right.  It means you was, then you can assume that I enjoyed one moan.  That was a trick question.  Of course it was.  What am I, stupid?  Steve.  How long have we been doing this?  Steve.  Yeah.  Are we going for rewrite number three?  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, we have to.  I was able to piece the last one you guys did together into something that sounded like  a commercial.  Oh, no.  Yeah, it does exist just because it has to run at some point.  See, they did it again.  Wait, what?  No, the...  What?  So what we just played, you cut up and made a commercial of? 
[01:01:00]  I did.  I don't see it in the rack anymore.  I don't know what happened to it.  Hold on, man.  Are you serious?  Oh, and it's going to play soon.  And it's playing?  Oh, no.  Come on.  Where is it?  Steve, we...  No!  I don't even...  I don't...  This is what...  What did you use as far as Opie's part?  Because I don't even remember...  Oh, no.  It's classic.  It's classic.  All right, wait.  Now we're going to listen.  This guy's getting a lot for his advertising dollar, I'll tell you right now. 
[01:01:30]  All right, here's what Steve made out of what we just played for you.  And let's talk S-E-X.  Oh, that's the other one.  That's the other one.  That's the other one.  Oh, that's yesterday.  Oh, no.  We know that one.  Yeah, and it sounds horrid.  Yeah, we don't...  We don't...  Yeah, we just play that on the air.  We don't want that to play anymore.  Right.  And that's why we did the second one.  Oh, I know.  And we don't like that, so now you've got to get a third one.  Oh, look at...  Oh, I'm going to do that one.  Look what...  See?  Look at what's happening now.  Look at Tim McCann from Worcester, Mass.  Look at what he writes.  Hearing you do the live reads makes me think you guys are the Bernie Taupin and Elton John 
[01:02:00]  of live reads.  We have to deal with that?  The Bernie Taupin and Elton John of live reads?  No one else that does live reads is as difficult as you guys.  Just need some fag piano music playing in the background.  And then we did...  We should play the other thing before we move on.  Why don't we get Lisa to read that?  I didn't realize I was touching my junk.  Dude, you know...  And why are you looking?  You're still...  I enjoy the flavor.  I like the hard, crisp, ample flavor. 
[01:02:30]  Why don't we get her to do the read?  When I'm sucking...  Here's my beat.  Hi.  Are you going to get a female voice for the sweet release?  My name's Laura because...  If we can.  I don't want to say my real name's Lisa.  When I suck big, fat...  I don't like the flavor sometimes.  But with sweet release, it doesn't matter.  Black...  Brown...  Yellow...  It all tastes like crisp apples. 
[01:03:00]  Ang, ang, ang, ang.  So next time you're laying there sprawled out with multiple...  In your face, make sure they use sweet release.  Ang.  So when they spew all over your face, it tastes nice when you lick it off.  Remember, my name's Laura because I don't want people to know my name's Lisa. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, she can do it.  Is this other thing worth playing?  Yeah, yeah.  If only for the part where you touched yourself halfway through it.  How do you know I was touching my junk?  They've realized at one point...  At one point, yeah.  The whole time.  As you're reading, you had your hand grabbing and not even just kind of hanging down by your...  Why are you guys looking?  Because you're looking, oh, why is he holding his...  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  You were holding your junk, man.  Thank you, Ann.  And Steve goes, why are you reading this holding your junk?  And you had no answer.  So this is another commercial for another place that has something to do with sex, right?  Yeah, basically.  All right.  Here's the raw audio of this.  Oh, boy.  Here's your script, Anthony.  Another script.  People are now giving us scripts.  It's O and then A.  Oh, no. 
[01:04:30]  What did she want?  Lisa.  Hello?  I mean, Laura.  Oh, wait.  Wait, wait.  We got it done.  Oh, you said it.  Ask me.  Beep.  Beep.  Laura.  Laura.  What?  No, wait.  Don't curse.  We're out, like, running.  I know.  I'm not supposed to.  I did it purposely.  Act, act, act, act.  Act yourself.  Do you want to help us with this read?  I'm not there to record it.  I think my voice sounds worse anyway. 
[01:05:00]  Than a guy's voice?  You could do it.  Say, I like to suck C.  I would be more than happy to come in tomorrow and help you boys.  Say, when I'm sucking a hog.  I am not saying that now.  I like the creamy c*** to taste like it.  No, no, Lisa.  We're at a dump.  The button is now dark.  Yeah, stop cursing.  Stop.  All right.  Stop.  All right.  All right.  I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  All right, Laura.  Ah, ah.  You can't say that.  Yeah.  You can say J-O, I think.  You can't say it that way.  Did I get dumped out of two?  Mm-hmm.  You can't say it that way.  Damn it.  J-O would have been just fine.  Yeah, I know.  I screwed up.  Ah, Steve, so this is for a, um, a whack-off shack, right?  What?  A jack shack? 
[01:06:00]  No!  It's a whack shack commercial, right?  Yep.  Holy ass.  Huh.  When is Chrysler coming aboard?  How about Pepsi?  As soon as they start selling dildos.  The Chrysler dildo.  That better made the air.  That is funny.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  All right.  So here's our, here's another one of our clients. 
[01:06:30]  It's, um, it's a, it's a whack shack somewhere in Portland, right?  Portland.  I believe so.  They like to whack in Portland.  Who doesn't?  You wouldn't have known that if you weren't syndicated.  See?  Syndication good.  All right.  So, uh, yeah, here's the raw audio.  Oh, boy.  Here's your script, Anthony.  I'm switching.  It was script.  O-N-A.  We hate scripts.  The script.  My script.  Now Portland is writing scripts for us.  Let's see how faggy we sound in this one. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, Portland, listen up.  There's an adult video store right in your own backyard that has everything you want.  Well, not absolute everything, but it's close.  Oh, I get it.  See, they don't have everything.  What the f***?  You said absolute everything.  Whatever.  Absolute this.  Hey, Portland, listen up.  There's an adult video store right in your own backyard that has everything you want.  Well, not absolutely everything.  They don't have seven-year-old boys, huddle-a, huddle-a.  Where's Jim Norton when you need them? 
[01:07:30]  What the f*** does that mean?  But it's close.  But it's close to what?  It's close to having everything?  Or is it close to everything, meaning there's a McDonald's nearby?  All right, go ahead.  I did pretty good with that line.  You're turning it.  What?  I did pretty good?  I feel bad for Steve because he really has to put this crap together.  Yeah, I've got to go and pick through and find the line you read well.  Yeah.  And then glue it to the line that Ant read well.  Isn't that terrible?  All right, so it's Ant's turn. 
[01:08:00]  Taboo adult video.  The one place in the...  You've got to stand over there.  I can't speak with you right next to me like that.  Makes me nervous.

[01:10:00]  And then Steve has to put it together, and he's like...  Why is he, like, laughing there?  It's so stupid.  Yeah.  They're trying to make it sound like their booths are amazing.  Amazing jack booths.  I love it.  You don't give a crap what a jack booth looks like.  You might not.  As long as you're a good jerk.  You're spanking in the booths.  What more do you need than indoor parking, private viewing booths, and a huge selection of DVDs for under $20? 
[01:10:30]  Answer, a live nude girl!  Oh, that's not the script.  Exactly, Anthony.  No excuses.  Taboo adult video has three locations to serve your adult rights.

Yeah.  Yeah.  In some form, it'll sound like a commercial.  It'll sound awful.

Well, we'll tell you all about Mount Everest guy next, okay?  Right.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this.  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly.  Sometimes you want to hear...  Be fine.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:12:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show in New York.  Give us a call.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston.  We're going to be in Boston tomorrow.  Yeah.  Broadcast live outside.  Outside.  Maybe outside.  Who knows?  We'll be at WBCN tomorrow.  We're going up there for the Jim Norton Show.  Showing our support here in Boston or anywhere else outside of New York. 
[01:13:00]  866-2774.  Wow.  Real fast, too.  We got a trip to L.A. to give away tomorrow while we're in Boston.  We're looking for the wildest or strangest thing you can bring down to WBCN for a trip to see MTV icon starring Aerosmith in L.A.  Easy as that.  Bring down something you think is going to make us go, wow, that's odd.  Or wild or strange or crazy.  It could be anything.  Yep. 
[01:13:30]  It could be an exotic animal.  It could be a celebrity.  It could be just something you've got laying around your apartment there.  Or your dorm room.  Whatever, man.  Trip to see Aerosmith in L.A.  Just show up at WBCN tomorrow between 3 and 7.  That's 1265 Boylston Street in Boston.  Lots of instant feedback coming in today, Anthony.  Wow, that looks just like Yasser Arafat.  And we're doing the side thing for other prizes?  Isn't that so just for us to see?  Yeah, any ladies want to come down with their lap looking dressed up like Yasser Arafat? 
[01:14:00]  That's what we should call it from now.  Yasser.  Yasser.  You see her, Yasser?  But they're going to get confused.  They're going to think it's for the trip to L.A.  No, that's just a little side thing.  We're looking for ladies brave enough to come down to WBCN tomorrow with their lap looking like Yasser Arafat.  Yeah.  Because we saw this picture in the New York papers of his facial hair.  A close-up of his mustache.  It looked like pubes.  It looked like old lady pubes.  Pubes.  Old ladies.  And this is going to AJC on Long Island. 
[01:14:30]  He goes, what the F is going on with these effing commercial breaks?  We screwed up because we went like an hour straight without breaking.  So now we're getting it up.  And I apologize.  You'll notice it'll be back to normal very soon here.  Dan from Hoboken.  Are you divas going to start giving Steve C. a two-page list of acceptable foods and bottled waters for your future taped reads with him?  We do sound like idiots, but...  Yeah.  We do a lot of them.  And usually we don't complain.  No, it's just ones that kind of make us sound ridiculous. 
[01:15:00]  And Wacker from Boston.  I would rather take my chances and go to church in mass than listen to you gay tools anymore.  And a man in my position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous.  All right, want to get an update from a Mount Everest guy?  Hell yeah.  This guy is going to be the first person, hopefully, to climb Mount Everest, I don't know, with asthma?  Yeah.  And he's going to put a wow sign on the top of Mount Everest. 
[01:15:30]  Dave!  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up, bro?  Good, man, good.  I just want to give an update.  I'm leaving on Tuesday the 9th.  Tuesday the 9th?  Yes.  I'm taking a flight out of Philadelphia International.  I'm taking a layover in England and then going up to Delhi, India.  And I'm going to start my voyage from there.  And then you're going to begin your ascent?  Well, from there I've got to walk, actually drive, for a few days up to Kathmandu.  And that's where we're going to start entering the north face of the mountains. 
[01:16:00]  Kathmandu.  Yes.  Yes.  But, um...  Are you going to have Sherpa with you?  The Sherpa?  The Sherpa, that's right, Sherpa.  No way.  What do you mean, no way?  Nah.  Only faggots use Sherpas, though.  That's right.  You've got to be a real man.  A real man.  Scale Everest without any guides.  So who's going to be your guide?  Uh, just my friends and I.  Yeah.  So we've done a lot of research and study and, uh...  You're so dead.  This guy is so dead.  You are so dead.  Did you read into thin air? 
[01:16:30]  Yes, I did.  You're so dead.  I can't believe how dead you're going to be with dead man talking.  Well, my buddy's been there several times and, uh, has checked out the scenery and whatnot.  So he has pretty much, uh...  So you guys need to climb without a guide?  Absolutely.  And without the Sherpa?  Well, if you get the Sherpa, you've got to pay like $65,000.  Well, it's kind of worth your life.  Nah, we'll do it.  We'll prove it when we bring it back to the wild sign.  And how do you know where to go?  Well, like I said, my friend's been up there and he's done a lot of research.  He's climbed to, uh, a level of 21,000 feet, so he's pretty familiar with the, uh, scenery. 
[01:17:00]  You know what this is?  This is like when your buddies get kind of hammered and decide to make a road trip at night.  And it's like, you ever been there?  I don't know, just hop in the car, man.  Let's go.  But it's Everest, you know?  Yes, sir.  But, um, my sign is just about finished.  I'll be done about tomorrow.  So, uh, I'm going to get some pictures of it and send it over to you guys over the weekend.  Yeah, what's your wow sign made of?  Because it's got to last up there.  Well, it's 16 pounds of, uh, two poles.  Well, actually, there are four poles broken into two so we can pack them up in the bag. 
[01:17:30]  And, uh, it's made of aluminum across.  So it can withstand the, uh, temperatures and whatnot and the winds.  Black girl from the future?  Yes.  Yes?  Yeah, this guy, uh, he did.  He dies.  I remember reading it in the paper.  Climb a missing or soon frozen to death.  That's the headlines.  Guys are killing me.  Hey, that's the last chance.  No, the mountain's going to frigging kill you.  Yeah, Dave, but, you know, these guides and the Sherpa, they, they understand when these  fronts come in and stuff.  Because you're going to look up and go, hey, blue sky.  Hey, it looks great. 
[01:18:00]  I'm going to go for it.  Yeah, how are you going to?  Nice thing you know, you're in a blizzard that a guide or a Sherpa would have told you  was coming to help you out a little bit.  Well, when you reach your final destination point before you make your, uh, last climb  to the North Face, that's called the Hillary Step.  Right before the Hillary Step, there's a, uh, peace camp where we stay in for about two  and a half weeks to, uh, adjust to the temperature, to the climate.  Right, the pressure and the temperature.  But then how are you going to know if it's safe to continue on any given day if you're  really not, you know, are you going to be consulting with meteorologists? 
[01:18:30]  Yes, absolutely.  Okay.  My friend's got a laptop and, uh, he's going to, he's...  My dad has an awesome set of tools.  I can fix it.  Well, he has a friend that works out of, uh, University of Colorado.  All right.  So he's a meteorologist so he can keep track of everything and whatnot.  A lot of people starting to say that you're full of S there, Dave.  He sounds like he knows a little too much to be full of crap.  Well, Matt is saying he's full of S.  It costs 60 grand, uh, to climb Everest alone.  Well, no, it's not if you have your equipment.  I have over $17,000 worth of equipment just alone. 
[01:19:00]  So, you know, that, if you want the guide and everything and lodging and whatnot, it  runs about $65,000 for them to take you up.  And then you, you're on your own as far as climbing the final, uh, steps.  All right, hold on.  A lot of people calling now.  Hold on.  Let me go to, let me go to Jimmy while you try to get that to work.  Dude?  Hey, uh, oh, man?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Um, next week, me and my buddies, we're going to the moon.  Um, we built this cool rocket ship out of an old Buick and some jet fuel.  And, uh, we're going to go to the moon.  I want to put a big wow flag on the moon. 
[01:19:30]  Well, that would rhyme.  It's cool because we got scuba gear so we can breathe.  And that's all we really need.  We're not, I'm not going with an astronaut or anything like that.  But we're just going to land there and, uh, you know, see how it happens.  We're going to hang out on the moon for a while.  Get a wow.  And then, um, we don't know how we're going to get back, but we figure we'll hitch a ride  with the next, uh, spaceship that, that comes there.  Sounds cool.  Oh, my God.  You guys are killing me.  Jimmy, what's going on?  You know, this guy's got to fork over. 
[01:20:00]  He's talking about 65 grand for this, uh, the whole Sherpa deal.  But he's got to fork over some clam just to hike this hill anyway.  You got to get a permit for that stuff.  Yeah, don't they charge, like, uh, to just, for the, for the privilege to climb it?  No, not that I'm aware of.  Uh-oh.  I've never been told that.  I've looked numerously and extensively into this, and I have never heard of any such thing.  Hmm.  So, maybe it'll be a surprise when they get there.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  We have the money.  No, there's no problem.  We got the money.  What, are you rich? 
[01:20:30]  Well, my friend's a dentist.  Is it Alan sniffing?  Yeah.  If it is, leave him up there.  I wouldn't hang out with a tool like him.  All right.  I'd throw him off the top of the hill, actually.  All right, man.  Dude, um, I still, Opie, maybe I'm naive, but I still totally believe the guy.  Well, I hope you do believe me, because it's going to happen, guys.  And, uh, you're going to have the first whale on top of the world.  You got my word on that.  Now, you're going to call us when you land in, uh, England?  Well, yeah, and if the guys that go to the moon want to see and say hi to us, you know,  it'll be more than half. 
[01:21:00]  I'll wave right up to him.  Well, you got to call us.  You know when we're on the air, you got to figure it out because of the time zones and  stuff.  Yeah.  You got to keep calling us and giving us, uh, reports, okay?  I sure will, guys.  Yeah, don't you all of a sudden calls and go, oh, I went.  I was there.  I was on the top of the world.  Right.  Okay.  You know, we need reports.  We need phone calls from Mount Everest.  Absolutely.  As you're sitting there just waiting to adjust.  Well, as long as, uh, weather's permitting and it allows my, uh, signals to go through,  I'll definitely call you every day.  All right, Greg, what's going on? 
[01:21:30]  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just want to tell that guy that he's not going to make it halfway up.  My friend's dad did it and one, it does cost about $60,000 to climb it.  Really?  $66,000.  Yeah, and you won't.  You're, you're full of that.  It's not going to happen.  Plus, you have asthma, right, Dave?  Yes, I do.  It's, it's not, uh, sporting, it's like the pollen, dust.  So, we don't think the elements will pretty much, uh, won't act it up.  I thought you told us you were going to be the first.  Elmets won't affect you?  I know.  It's not ever.  What the hell is wrong with you? 
[01:22:00]  I have an illness.  I, I, thank you.  I thought you said you were going to be the first guy with asthma to climb Mount Everest.  Oh, yes.  Well, asthma.  Not the first guy with an allergy attack to, you know, ragweed.  Well, no, I have, it's, it's legitimate asthma.  It's legitimate asthma.  But it's, asthma is just an allergy in general anyway.  All right.  That's all asthma is.  But you said you were, you know, there were, there were a lot of articles written about  you and stuff because you're the first person with asthma to climb, uh, Mount Everest.  Right.  I've never said anything like that.  You guys came up with that. 
[01:22:30]  I'm just saying to myself that I am, I've researched all the climbers and I'm the first  person that will ever climb with asthma.  You know.  No one's ever been crazy enough to attempt at the 5th man.  Anthony, I'm going to have to take the other side.  I think this guy's full of S and somehow he's going to have to prove to us that he's  climbing Mount Everest.  Really?  If we get a call from, uh, Kathmandu.  Okay.  In Nepal, expeditions are controlled by the, hold on, hold on.  In Nepal, expeditions are controlled by the HMG Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation 
[01:23:00]  to, uh, climb Everest.  Here's what we're talking.  Here, fee for up to extra per person.  Well, this is, I guess, uh, 7 and part of 12, Mount Everest, $70,000.  Right.  Per group.  And then $10,000 per person.  Mount Everest, other routes, $50,000, $10,000 per person.  Sounds about right.  So, dude, it's going to cost you a lot of money. 
[01:23:30]  How many people in your group?  Three.  Three.  Three, so you've got to pay $50,000.  And where are you going?  I'm sorry?  And which, uh, face are you taking?  North face.  North face.  Yes.  It's, uh, side facing China.  The other side of the mountain, not the south side.  That's sad.  South side's one of the hardest, uh, ways to go.  Right.  Well, you know, it looks like it's going to cost you about $80,000, $130,000. 
[01:24:00]  $50,000 just to do it, and then it's going to cost $10,000 per person in your group.  Well, it's a free mountain.  How can they, I don't understand how they can charge you to climb a mountain.  Oh, no, you don't understand because you've got to pay.  This is so every clown with asthma from Philly doesn't decide they're going to climb the goddamn mountain.  It keeps the riffraff off the mountain.  These fees are payable within two months of the date of permission.  So you should have sent in a checker, Eddie, my friend. 
[01:24:30]  I am going to climb it no matter what.  Try and stop me, anyone out there.  Oh, man.  You got your plant-eye goops, whatever you want.  Your story is falling apart.  It's not falling apart, guys.  You haven't made any, uh, any applications to climb this mountain?  No, I have not.  I've been doing expensive training.  It's expensive training.  You can't just, everyone is saying you need permits.  They're calling like crazy.  You need all kinds of permits.  Brian wants to say hi.  Brian, what's up?  Yo, man, this dude's going to die. 
[01:25:00]  I have experience climbing, mountains climbing, you know, rock climbing and backpacking and stuff.  But what's your experience, Dave?  Have you ever been camping, at least?  I'm sorry?  Have you ever been camping?  Yeah, I grew up while I was camping.  Dude, it was either Mount Everest or Daytona Beach.  We were deciding where to take spring break.  So we were like, dude, Everest, man.  You know how far pot goes on Everest?  The smallest hit, you are so stoned.  Because it's like, all pot you get. 
[01:25:30]  But dude, you know something?  It's a lot of money.  You're talking for eight people, $130,000.  Payable within two months of the date of permission.  So you've got to ask permission.  And then when they can fit you in, who knows how long that is.  But within two months, you've got to pay them $130,000.  And then on their time, you will climb.  You know that people have died climbing Mount Everest because they got behind slow pokes? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  It's like when you're on the golf course and people have too many practice pots.  Because the last leg of climbing Mount Everest is, you know, extremely dangerous.  And if you're behind slow climbers, people have died because of that.  Yeah.  Hey, Kevin, what's up?  Hey, hey, even if this guy is telling you the truth, he's going to die.  He's saying that they're going to sleep for two and a half weeks at Hillary's step to acclimate themselves?  Yeah, that's impossible.  That's about 100 feet from the top, jackass.  I know.  And if you're right into thin air, you can only survive, what, two minutes at that point? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, exactly.  This guy has no idea what he's doing.  We're below Hillary's step.  He's not coming back.  We're about 2,000 feet below Hillary's step.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, people get pissed off.  I know.  I don't know why people are so pissed.  Well, there's some feedback coming in, Adam from Boston.  He has about as much chance of reaching the top of Everest as Voss has of doing a second deaf comedy jam.  And Mikey B from Brooklyn.  Hey, guys, me and my buddy are going to be the first people with tennis elbow to swim to Cuba. 
[01:27:00]  Later, tools.  Oh, my gosh.  Man.  The approval of the list is wrong.  That's all.  Yeah.  The approval of the list is wrong.  That's all.  We got all excited, but now we're thinking that this isn't going to happen.  All right.  Let it fly and we'll see what goes.  You know that Mount Everest isn't in the Appalachians, right?  I know that.  The Appalachians.  I believe it's in the Rockies, right?  Oh, brother.  A couple more here. 
[01:27:30]  Hold on.  All right.  Yeah.  This guy, a lot of people are saying he need permits.  John, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  It's full of it.  It's full of it.  Whoop.  Whoop.  He's full of it.  Go ahead.  He need permits for one thing to get on Everest.  Listen, you know, is he still on the line?  Yeah.  Has he ever swung an ice axe before?  Yes, I have.  You have?  Where have you swing ice axes before?  You know how to rope up?  You know how to lead?  Yes.  I've done rock climbing.  You've done rock climbing?  I've done rock climbing. 
[01:28:00]  I've climbed to the Rockies.  I've done several things.  I've done rock climbing at New York Sports Clubs.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  He's been to Chelsea Piers or Philly Rock Gym.  Do you know how to clip?  Do you know how to set ice screws?  I sure do.  Yeah, okay.  How do you do?  Like to swing Doritos in your mouth?  Your big, fat mouth?  Oh.  Yeah, okay.  That's right.  Awesome.  This guy, you have to have permits ahead of time, at least a year ahead of time, to get  on Everest, even to get out there.  Well.  Or else you're going to get arrested. 
[01:28:30]  Dave, explain the ice screws.  Yeah, what are those?  The ice screws?  No, that's John.  I want Dave, who's climbing Mount Everest, to explain it.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to hit him with your action.  You've got to make sure you think him right.  No, wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Dude, I know what I'm talking about.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Explain to a person that doesn't understand how to do it.  No, no, no.  You need to chisel out a little spot, then you screw it in.  Hey, you're not like that.  You ever see Rocky Dennis there in Mask?  Oh, man.  He planned his trip with his best friend and put the pins in the map, and then it never 
[01:29:00]  happened, and he got all pissed off.  Oh, God.  You're not going to throw all your hammers and stuff.  That was such a sad scene.  When they had to take all the pins down.  He was taking all the pins out of the map.  He had this whole trip planned out, and his buddy backed out on him.  Oh, my God.  And poor Rocky Dennis had to pull the pins out of the map.  Did the buddy back out, or did Rocky get too sick?  No, the buddy backed out.  And Sharon had to take the pins out of the map.  The buddy backed out.  Sharon took the pins out of the map after the kid died.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:29:30]  How can you compare to this?  That retard.  Remember that?  He was like, I don't care what you say.  We should take our trip.  Hey, last time you called, you did say you had a camera crew.  Absolutely.  Who's the camera crew?  Your buds?  What's that?  Your buddies?  My buddy P's got a camcorder.  My buddy has a photography studio, yeah.  And he knows how to run cameras and whatnot.  You know, a regular little, maybe, Panasonic camcorder can't really handle the extreme conditions.  I'm not much on cameras.  I don't know much about him, but I know he does run a company as far as that.  Listen, Jim is setting off on his own adventure. 
[01:30:00]  Yes, Jim?  Yeah, guys.  I'm going to bring a wild sign to China for you.  Oh, cool.  I'm starting to dig the hall this afternoon.  And I'd like to keep in touch with you guys.  In my progress, I'm going to bring a tin can with a couple of strings.  Really?  So you're going to be digging to China.  I'm going to China.  Dig to China.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  And I've got a tip for the climber.  Yeah.  Keep us up, Dave.  You've got to bring two S's to turn the wild sign into SOS.  Oh, man. 
[01:30:30]  Man.  That's classic.  You are getting hammered.  Yeah, it's okay.  Yeah, David.  None of these pussies have enough balls to try to do what I'm doing, sir.  But, you know something?  Balls are one thing.  And legally doing this with the permits that are involved is another thing.  Are you actually flying to England to start this trek?  Yes, I am.  You have your plane tickets?  Yes, I do.  No, you don't need tickets.  You walk on the plane and it just flies you over there.  All right.  So when you get to England, right?  Yes. 
[01:31:00]  You'll give us a call and give us the number you're at so we can prove that you're calling us from England at least.  Absolutely.  That'll be the next step.  Well, I've got a cell phone, so.  Oh, boy.  I can always do that.  If you want to record the bills, go for it.  I don't care.  No, we'll pay for it.  You call from a phone in England so we can prove that you're at least there.  Okay.  Because that'll be the first leg of the journey, right?  That's the first leg of the journey.  And when will you be in England?  I will be there on Tuesday night.  Somewhere.  I'm leaving at 3 o'clock in the afternoon at Philly.  All right.  Figure out with the time zones when we're on the air and you give us a call. 
[01:31:30]  When are you leaving?  You can even call us collecting.  3 o'clock Tuesday afternoon.  Well, it's like 3.03, 3.04.  Next Tuesday?  This coming Tuesday?  This Tuesday, that night.  And then I'm going right over there, straight out to India.  Straight to India?  Yes.  From England?  Yes.  And then what are you going to do?  It's a layover in England.  So let me get this straight.  Wait, I've got to get this straight.  Then you and your buddies are just going to look up at the mountain and go, let's go.  No.  And just start hiking and hope that no one from the tourism department is watching you. 
[01:32:00]  Well, not exactly like that, no.  And they're also a safety, like you have to register with these people for your own safety  so they know that you're up there.  I've never heard of such a thing.  Oh, my God.  They have to document where the bodies are.  All right.  We're going to keep an open mind.  When you get to the top of Mount Everest, could you get a Yeti to hold the wow sign for us?  A Yeti.  Oh, you guys are killing me, man. 
[01:32:30]  This isn't a Coors Beer commercial, you know.  Oh, man.  You'll see the wow sign on top of Everest.  That's all I've got to say.  All right.  You know something?  No matter how, it will be done.  That happens.  You'll get the biggest prize package ever.  You got it, guys.  All right.  So we look forward to your next phone call, Dave.  Yes.  All right.  All right, man.  Dave, the guy that's going to Mount Everest.  You told us have a good day.  All right, man.  You suck.  Eatabullet.com.  All right.  There goes Dave.  There he goes. 
[01:33:00]  You don't believe him anymore, do you?  No, no.  Okay, good.  I actually believed him for a while there because I thought he had everything in order.  Right.  I thought he was going to die for sure if he was able to try it, but I thought he was at  least going to try it, but Jim's going to correct us.  Jim, go ahead.  I wonder if you were picking on there, Rocky Dennis, didn't share, put the pins in the map  after he died?  Hmm.  You know something?  He may have pulled the pins out when his buddy ditched him, and then when he was dead, 
[01:33:30]  I think Cher walked in and started putting the pins back to keep the dream alive.  They'll be sticking pins in the Mount Everest guy because the Napoli's prisons aren't that  friendly, you know, when they pick them up there.  Al Mack from Clifton, is this guy's real name Brian, and is he wearing an eye patch and  a bandage?  Wow.  What a callback.  Good callback.  Dalton, what's going on?  How you doing?  Good.  I just want to talk to you about this strange item that I'm going to bring over to BCN tomorrow. 
[01:34:00]  I think it'll win it all.  All right.  What are you bringing?  A piece of my lung.  Coughed up lung.  What?  You can't cough up your lung?  On Everest, don't we?  He did it on Everest.  I have it in a jar.  It was a big procedure, and I don't smoke or anything like that.  Wait, wait, wait.  So you didn't really cough up the lung.  They took a piece of your lung out.  Well, it's not like, you know, my lung, but it's a piece of my lung.  It's called alveoli.  It's a little, like, air sac. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, and that's at the very bottom of all the air passages.  How do you cough that up?  I don't know, but it's in a jar, and I'm going to bring it over to BCN tomorrow.  All right.  Well, we'll take a look tomorrow, Ant.  I don't believe him.  All right?  You'll see it tomorrow.  All right.  One other point on Joe O'Reilly.  I like the guy.  I did like the guy.  I think you guys did a great job in the show.  I lost a lot of respect for the guy.  All right.  But you guys did a great job.  He's doing his thing.  Yeah.  Thank you, bro.  Thanks for the support. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, tomorrow, Anthony, we're going to be in Boston for Jim Norton's show.  I think he's playing Saturday at...  Friday.  He's playing Friday night?  At where?  Avalon.  Avalon.  Friday at Avalon.  Okay.  So we're broadcasting live.  We're supporting him.  And we're asking for the wildest or strangest thing you can bring to WBCN while we broadcast live.  The winner's going to win a trip to see MTV icon starring Aerosmith in L.A.  A trip to L.A. for the wildest or strangest thing you bring down to the radio station tomorrow as we broadcast live. 
[01:35:30]  It's always a party outside the station.  Right.  Just show up at WBCN tomorrow between 3 and 7, 1265 Boylston Street in Boston with your wild and strange things.  And we'll determine who wins it, right?  Right.  You want to explain real fast?  It could be anything.  Yeah, anything.  Coughed up lung.  Coughed up lung.  Some, I don't know, anything.  It's really up to you.  Something you think will amaze us.  All right.  Where do you want me to go in?  Line 11.  All right.  Jesus. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, Mike.  Mike?  Mike.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's happening?  I'm going to borrow my father's scuba equipment and put a wow sign on the Titanic for me.  You're going to go scuba diving and put a wow on the Titanic?  Yeah, I'm going to do it for you guys.  Now, that seems impossible, dude.  Hey, this guy's going to climb Everest.  How are you going to breathe?  Hey, man.  It's my father's scuba equipment.  I'm sure it's going to work.  Now, don't you know the water pressure is really hard and it's freezing cold down there that deep? 
[01:36:30]  Who needs water pressure?  No, I'm talking about the pressure on your body will squish you.  Well, I guess I haven't thought that far ahead.  Me and my buddy's going to do it.  It's going to go.  All right.  Well, good luck to you and keep us updated.  You guys rule.  All right.  Bye, Mike.  Dave from Long Beach over here up.  He says, dudes, I can see it now.  The Raiders of the Lost Ark map with the plane flying to the various cities so he can stop and take his asthma medicine.  Dan, da-da-da-da. 
[01:37:00]  Guy thinks he's Indiana Jones.  Yeah.  He's going to climb Everest.  Okay.  That's great.  We've got to talk about the black man game today.  And I think we need the ladies to call.  Maxim Magazine has sex mistakes.  Yeah.  The top five sex mistakes.  That guys make when they're with their checks.  And the ladies are going to call with what we're doing wrong in bed, okay?  And then we'll read this top five list, okay? 
[01:37:30]  Right.  And much, much more.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  2-1-2-8-3-0-3-7-8-5.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out the show today.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Got to move on about a bunch of things coming in about Mount Everest.  Let's go to Will Hong.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Will Hong?  Did this guy claim that he's going to be the first asthma person to go up on Mount Everest?  Yeah, the first time he called us, he said that. 
[01:38:00]  He's about eight years too late.  Why?  Just type in Mount Everest and asthma on any search engine.  And you'll come up with tons of people that have done it.  Not only that, asthma medication doesn't work up there.  The common inhalers, it says it doesn't work.  That's hilarious.  I was so excited that this guy was really doing this for the show.  He's going to die up there for the show.  I know.  It sounded good.  All right, Will Hong.  Thank you.  Guys, I'm going to capture the lock this monster for the show.  It's going to be great. 
[01:38:30]  John, what's up?  I'm going to put a big wow sticker on Bigfoot's ass.  I've been to Everest.  No, just visited it.  It's not like going to Bear Mountain where you just drive out there and you're there.  You need to book and have your transportation.  And once you're there, it's not like, okay, I'm here.  Let's just start climbing.  There's like two or three paths you can go up.  And you need to have Sherpas with you.  Of course.  There's no way two people can do it.  Of course.  Hey, guys, real quickly, not to change the subject, but a quick question, if you don't mind.  Yeah.  When you guys do worst of, why don't you guys tap the golden age of Spaz a little bit more? 
[01:39:00]  Because for my money, and I've been a long-time listener since the second week you've been on the air in New York,  two of the funniest moments that ever happened on the ONA show was when Spaz wanted to direct a porno movie and wanted you guys in it.  Okay, okay.  Dead.  Dead.  He's dead to us.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Thank you, John.  There you go.  Dude, chill out.  What?  Just talking about somebody.  I don't care.  Dead.  Dead to me. 
[01:39:30]  Frank, what's up?  Hey, the funniest moment on this whole Everest trip is trying to watch this guy get through the Philadelphia airport security.  What's your final destination?  Kathmandu.  What do you have in the bag?  Ice picks and axes.  Yeah, that's true.  How's he going to get the ice picks?  On the plane.  The guy's going to be dead in the airport.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Later.  I think we can all agree he's not going to do this.  I wouldn't worry about it. 
[01:40:00]  Douchebag.  I was so hoping it would have been a real deal.  You know?  How cool would that have been?  We'll never see a wow sign on the top of Everest.  No.  Might be for real.  You never know.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah, this was a fun story we saw yesterday. 
[01:40:30]  And there's an interesting new twist to it.  You know those Titanic inflatable boat things?  Huh?  Yeah.  Well, it seems...  When was it?  Tuesday?  The thing collapsed on some children.  A big gust of wind.  Big gust of wind blew and collapsed on top of the children. 
[01:41:00]  Big wind dead ahead.  It was ten children taken to the hospital with minor injuries.  You're seeing these things.  You're seeing these things.  It's a big thing.  It looks like the Titanic sinking into a lawn.  And it's an inflatable little slide.  The kids slide down.  Well, the wind was a little brisk.  And it blew over.  And some kids got like stuck underneath the plastic.  And nothing big.  No big injuries or anything.  I think it's great, though, the fact that they made a ride out of a huge disaster. 
[01:41:30]  Killed thousands of people.  And now, finally, it gets a little retribution by hurting some small children.  But this is the kicker, man.  The mothers of ten children that were hurt.  You know, they probably got some scrapes and little bruises and whatnot.  Suing for $100 million.  Suing the carnival in Queens and the city of New York for $100 million. 
[01:42:00]  Blaming the collapse of negligence.  The family's lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein.  Sanford Rubenstein.  I'm going to consult with Grady Blumberg.  Googly boo, Fred.  Great googly moogly, Fred.  Show them now.  The children's was hurt. 
[01:42:30]  These people, obviously, are just...  They're kind of thinking they won lotto.  I see a case here.  Where's Lamont Green?  Lamont.  I'm Sanford Rubenstein, representing the families of the injured child.  $100 million.  That'll get us out of Watts.  They were crying.  It almost suffocated their children.  They were frantic and crying, said Eunice Owey, one of the parents. 
[01:43:00]  And LaChique Sinclair said there was shouting, cursing, panicked parents.  I just don't know how in one day you could assess your child's damages to the point of $100 million.  Doesn't it take like weeks or months for people to realize they're having nightmares or they've been affected mentally by this balloon thing collapsing? 
[01:43:30]  $100 million taken out of New York.  And we really could...  Yeah, we could really give away $100 million at this point in the city of New York.  What was the worst injury?  They didn't even say.  They just said minor injuries, scrapes, bruises, nothing like that.  And it's made out of rubber.  When we were kids, it was made out of steel.  We used to have this thing.  We used to play it.  Solid steel with cement on the bottom.  Yeah, now it's plastic.  It could kill you.  There were vultures circling around it.  It's inflated rubber and $100 million. 
[01:44:00]  They think they won the lotto.  It was in, let's just say, it's in a neighborhood where perhaps money isn't really pouring in.  And they feel now that they could sue the city.  This is their lottery ticket.  Yeah.  God bless and good luck.  We're getting Rollo Rabinowitz in on the case.  Where's Rollo?  Lamont Schwartz.  Sanford Rubenstein.  James! 
[01:44:30]  I gotta get some matzo, James.  We're gonna pass over dinner, James.  Give me some bitter herbs.  JJ!  James!  And as Sanford Rabinowitz puts on his groovy colored yarmulke on his afro,  the Titanic ride blew over from a cleef coming out of my giant package. 
[01:45:00]  Elizabeth!  A hundred million dollars, Elizabeth!  I'm coming, Elizabeth!  Elizabeth!  Well, Godspeed.  And good luck.  Have fun when you're lost.  On your hundred million dollar raping of the city of New York.  A cleef?  Back in the old days.  Came out of Ann Esther!  Back in the olden days, you got hurt playing on something. 
[01:45:30]  That was it.  Remember that goddamn whiplash ride they used to take around Flushing, New York?  It was on the back of a truck.  It was called the Whip or something.  And it ran with this big diesel engine.  You're like, ah!  He'd come around like an ice cream truck would make the rounds.  You'd pay him whatever the hell it was.  The kids got in this big cage with seats in it.  And it would go in an oval.  Very slow on the straights.  And then in the curves, it would whip your head where it was hitting the cage.  It was called the Whiplash or something. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, and it would have...  With this big...  There's spinning gears and motors and everything.  And it would have the added tune version of Old MacDonald.  Yeah.  Yeah, bad music playing in the background.  Just a horrible, dangerous thing to play on.  I don't remember that at all.  Yeah, they used to go around the neighborhood.  You remember that, right?  Out there in Queens.  Yeah.  That spinning thing.  They'd have a concrete playground.  And then kids would get on the big spinning thing.  Oh, they got rid of those.  At 50 miles an hour.  And people would just fly off and trickle forth. 
[01:46:30]  They finally figured out that that's not a good idea.  Monkey bars.  Let's have something you could climb on that if you fall, you have to bounce off of 20 things  before you even hit the ground.  Nice 20-gauge steel to cushion the fall.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Scooping brains off the bars.  Yeah, now everything there is cushy pillows on playgrounds and stuff.  But the Titanic ride, it seems relatively safe, even if it tips over.  The thing's falling.  Oh, my God, it's falling.  It's falling over.  It's falling.  Still falling. 
[01:47:00]  Falling.  It's a balloon.  It's a balloon.  Yeah, tire chains on the swings.  The swings, remember that?  The tires.  Yeah.  Now that was dangerous play toy stuff.  The slip and slide.  The lawn darts.  Hit a dry spot on the slip and slide.  Hey!  A little puff of smoke off your side.  What the hell is that?  We didn't sue.  It's burning flesh.  Well, we have a new song by Wesley Willis. 
[01:47:30]  I love this guy.  The homeless guy from Chicago.  We got Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Where is Rock and Roll McDonald's?  People love Rock and Roll McDonald's.  We started the show with it today.  You got it, Rick?  Want to play it right now?  Yeah, just to give people a taste.  There's a second song that we're going to play.  Sounds exactly like Rock and Roll McDonald's, but it's about his mom smoking crack.  Smoking crack.  Crack rocks.  Here's a little taste of Wesley Willis singing Rock and Roll McDonald's.  As we cue it up. 
[01:48:00]  Sounds just like the other song.  McDonald's is a place to rock.  Oh, this is Rock and Roll McDonald's.  It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat.  It is a good place to listen to the music.  People flock here to get down to the rock music.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's. 
[01:48:30]  McDonald's will make you fat.  They serve Big Macs.  They serve quarter pounders.  They will put pounds on you.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's. 
[01:49:00]  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Boy, ah, I know, not enough vocals. 
[01:49:30]  That's a basic gist.  McDonald's hamburgers are the worst.  They are worse than Burger King.  A Big Mac has 26 grams of fat.  A quarter pounder has 28 grams of fat.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's. 
[01:50:00]  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock over London.  Rock on Chicago.  We need London.  Perfect for champions.  All right.  Wesley Willis.  That's rock and roll McDonald's.  Hold on.  There's a guy that wanted to make a comment about the Titanic slide.  Barry, what's up?  Yeah, guys.  Great show. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, thanks, bro.  You're very welcome.  You were saying about how when we were kids, you know, that we got hurt.  No one sued.  Well, go back to 1912.  The Titanic was owned by White Star Line.  Yeah.  Those people didn't get anything.  The family members of the 1,200 people that drowned, they didn't even get a dollar out of that.  So the people that actually died, their family got nothing.  And the people that, the children were on the little cushy ride that fell over, they won $100 million.  It's amazing, huh? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, because they went down, when Robert Ballard went down there and he took up a piece of the hull, they found out that the steel was bad.  And we would have known that back then.  If that happened now, oh, forget about it.  It would be a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.  Of course.  I learned that lawyers didn't have it figured out in 1912 yet.  No, not at all.  All right, thank you, Barry.  Take care, guys.  And real fast, Reuben.  Reuben.  Yeah, this is Reuben.  What's up?  Well, I'm talking about those rides in the playground.  Yeah.  How many times you sit on a seesaw and have your friends bust your junk open? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, they jump off?  They jump off, yeah.  Yeah, it was usually the bigger guy.  Exactly.  Because he could hold you up in the air.  And then he'd jump off, put his foot on it.  I've seen this, too.  Where he stands on it and goes, I'm going to let go.  No.  And then he drops you down and you break your tailbone.  Exactly.  Not knowing all you had to do was keep your legs down and out and you'd just end up standing up.  You would have been all right.  Well, jump off.  All right, Reuben.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And then really fast. 
[01:52:00]  Rob, what's going on, man?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  A little perspective here.  Abner Oluma got $9 million for being anally assaulted in the 7-0 precinct.  Right.  And these guys won $100 million because a balloon fell on them.  Yeah, yeah.  Their kids got a little shaken up.  Take it easy, guys.  A balloon fell on them.  That's a good point right there.  All right.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Now we got a new song from Wesley Willis.  Yeah, this is about his mother smoking crack.  Oh, wait.  Alan Sniffen is...  God damn it, there's so much going on today.  I guess Alan Sniffen, instead of filling cavities today, was listening to our whole rant about 
[01:52:30]  him on the New York Radio message board there.  Oh, really?  So now he has posted, nice to know I can make ONA nervous.  Uh-huh.  A dentist is now making us nervous, Anthony.  Yeah.  I am nervous to go to the dentist, but...  Not to listen to a dentist's opinion.  Alan, you're so full of yourself.  Yeah.  We just like pointing out people that make fools of themselves.  That's all that's about.  The truth is hard to take. 
[01:53:00]  It always is.  I guess that's why ONA dedicated a huge portion of their show today to my board reflections  today.  No, about 20 to 25 minutes, Alan.  Yeah.  It's nice to know my words are so highly regarded that they felt it necessary to respond immediately.  The fact is that syndication has hurt this show in New York.  Just look at the ratings for all the proof you need.  That's why ONA were so upset.  We're not upset, Alan.  We're still number one in the ratings.  Number one is still number one.  Denial is a strong thing, but ratings are ratings.  All right, Alan, look them up.  We're still number one.  And that was the problem. 
[01:53:30]  They couldn't actually refute my comments, even as they played board reflections over  the air.  So instead, we got a bunch of adolescent rambling.  They probably can't come up with anything else to scream about this week.  Of course, that's the problem with this show.  It's boring, and it didn't used to be.  Oh, and for those of you who will support them to the ends of the world, maybe you should  consider the depths their show has sunk to when they have to use me for material.  We use you for material, Alan, because you're a tool, and it was very entertaining.  We love putting tools on the show.  Is it that I'm so important or that they're so desperate? 
[01:54:00]  Alan, no, you're not that important.  I don't think those are the two choices.  And we're not desperate.  Oh, God.  You are so...  The guy is so full of himself.  You're delusional.  Alan, it hurts because you never made it in radio, right, Alan?  Pick one.  I'll go along with either interpretation.  What a dope...  You remember when we played a board reflections of his a long time ago?  Mm-hmm.  What's the matter, Alan?  That was back when you said the show was good.  And we played one of your board reflections back then. 
[01:54:30]  But what?  Back then it wasn't desperate?  Or thinking you're so important?  I want to thank, Alan.  You gave us a hilarious segment.  It was funny.  It was great making you look and sound like a tool.  Yeah.  Stick to gingivitis, you numbskull.  All right.  Floss.  So we got the new Wesley Willis song.  That sounds a lot like Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Sounds just like the other one.  And this one is...  I've got to read what the title is again.  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks. 
[01:55:00]  He's a homeless guy from Chicago.  Right.  We're going to get him on the show soon, but he's either in jail, on vacation, or...  That's a homeless guy going on vacation.  I don't know.  Something's going on with him, but we're going to have him on the show very, very soon.  As we debut another one on the Opie and Anthony show.  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks.  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks. 
[01:55:30]  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks.  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks.  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks.  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks.  My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks.  She had a good time at it.  She's Jack Sparone for no money.  She does it by drinking him with a Slytherin Western.  My mind is fucks red rocks 
[01:56:00]  My mind is fucks red rocks  My mind is fucks red rocks  My mind is fucks red rocks  That's great  At 11 o'clock p.m.  The police came to my mother's house to check her  They arrested my mother for possession of controlled substance  My mother was sticking to the metal clink  They locked her up for being a loser 
[01:56:30]  My mind is fucks red rocks  My mind is fucks red rocks  My mind is fucks red rocks  My mind is fucks red rocks  Rock over London  Rock on Chicago  Remco  Again  Go ahead and get it in store  There you go  Wesley Willis  My mom smokes crack rocks  My mama smokes crack rocks 
[01:57:00]  Rock and roll McDonald's  It's the same song  The music interlude wasn't as long though  Thank God  Yeah, thank God  I think he learned  Hey, what's up guys?  What's up?  Hey, I whooped that man's ass  Yeah, I heard that's a good one  How nuts is that one?  Do you guys have it?  Yeah, we got that one as well  Yeah, you should hook that one up  That one's my favorite  Does that sound just like  Rock and roll McDonald's  And my mom smokes crack rock?  It's a little different  He gets a little funky in that one  A little different feel  He's matured as a musician  In that one  Yeah, you can see that 
[01:57:30]  As an artist  Yeah  Does he use luscious luscious boobs  Because artists like  Working that into  No, I think he uses  The Wheaties breakfast  Of champions line  Oh, he used that  In the other one too  Yeah  Great line  We'll give it a listen  Thanks guys  Alright, let's try it out  I whooped Batman's ass  Wesley Willis  Oh yeah  A little slower  Batman got on my nerves  He was running me a moat  He ridiculed me 
[01:58:00]  Calling me a bum  I whooped  Batman's ass  I whooped  Batman's ass  I whooped  Batman's ass  Batman thought he was bad

I think so  Alright, Wesley Willis  Wow, that's good  Batman's ass  That would be the single  Yeah, that's the single  I think that's the balance 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, Rock and Roll McDonald's is the single  That's the ballad  Yeah, that's the power ballad  Every homeless fat guy has a soft side  I feel bad for the engineer  You know, the guy probably mixed Aerosmith and Zeppelin  Now he's got this bum in there  Nah, I think he mixed too much vodka and gin  That's a Casio in a living room somewhere  Right  Alright, we gotta take a break  The ladies are standing by with their sex pet peeves  Oh, yes  So we'll go to you ladies next  So don't go anywhere  In the meantime, let's go to the FU line  Thanks for calling

Like cause you enough uncomfortableness  Pain, yes  Enough pain that you can't even enjoy the rest of the ride  Right  Like  Well, uh, you're not alone, Brie  Cause, uh  Oh, is that one of them?  One of the big sex mistakes  is, uh, python tongue oral action 
[02:10:00]  There you go  Python tongue  Guys don't realize that we like it soft  Down, uh, you know where  This isn't a strong tongue contest  Like a safe or not drinking out of a water dish  So, there you go  You're not alone with that one  Alright, Brie from D.C., thank you  Thank you, guys  Love the show  Thanks  I'm distracted  Cause, uh, Davida is calling in  You might remember Davida from the Naughty Nighty contest 
[02:10:30]  Right  She has a, uh, a sex pet piece  Really?  Yes  Uh, Davida  Hey, what's up, guys?  It's Davida  How you doing?  Hey, Davida, what's up?  I really hate it during sex  When guys insist on putting a bag over my head  I don't know why they don't want to see my face  It looks like cancer  Later  Oh, my God  I didn't know Davida was checking in today 
[02:11:00]  Her voice does get deeper and deeper  PJ, uh, is checking in saying  Opie, why are you fronting with the ghetto accent while you talk to the sister?  You sound like Carson Daly interviewing Puff Daddy  You ever see when Puff, when Carson interviews Puffy, all of a sudden it's like  So, Puffhead, I'm down with it  It's like you're still Carson Daly  Shut up  Oh, this is another good one  Uh, Marianne, which is, uh  She's better known as the Little League mom that comes in here and has hot lesbian 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my God, yeah  Lesbian action every once in a while  As her husband looks on  Looks on  As her little kid is just waiting  Oh, that's right  The softball game  Waiting at a baseball field somewhere  Little League  Little League, wondering where Mommy is  Yeah, and meanwhile, Mommy was on the floor with about five other girls  Just doing unspeakable things  Allegedly  Really?  These girls were trying to hit all the bases  Oh, yeah  Just like, uh, Marianne's little son in Little League there 
[02:12:00]  So these, uh, these girls are laying on the floor doing stuff  And then, uh, Little League mom just comes strolling in  Takes her clothes off  And we're like, oh, where is she?  Is that the mom?  Oh, look at that  She's just taking her clothes off and joining in  And the dad is just standing there like, yeah, isn't it fun?  Hmm  Had his hand  His hand looked like, uh, it was Opie doing a read  He had it right on his crotch  So what's up, Marianne?  Hey, guys, how you doing? 
[02:12:30]  Alright, are you on your way to a Little League game?  A soccer game?  What are you doing today?  No, he's taking care of baseball practice today  Okay  So, I just got home from work, so  But I heard your subject today  And I just had to pipe in  Um, I think about  Well, when I was dating  Many moons ago  Uh, bad thing to do  Uh, when a guy goes down  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, well, well  A little dangerous  Might make it, might not  So we might want to, uh, explain it differently  Use a little more, uh, obscure, uh, terms 
[02:13:00]  Like, uh, go south  Yeah, a guy goes south  Okay, when a guy goes south  And he's going to visit the little man in the boat  Oh, very good  Oh, good, good, good  And, um, you know, the little man has a hood on  Uh-huh  And he pulls the hood back  And he starts to apply direct pressure to the little man's head  Ah, boy  Bad thing.  So don't ever do that because it makes the girls' toes feel like they're going to go on fire.  And is that good or bad?  That's bad. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, okay.  That bad.  A little man on the boat likes to have his hood on most of the time.  Ah.  Well, it's similar to another one of the mistakes in this magazine here.  It's called hot button abuse.  Mm-hmm.  Definitely.  Hot button abuse.  Definitely a bad thing.  This lady, Janie, writes,  Guys seem to think they're so smart, and once they find your little man in the boat,  they should never, ever leave it.  Exactly.  Ah.  So that definitely made the list, and I could see why. 
[02:14:00]  And then she writes,  Unless I'm shouting something like,  Holy Mother of God, move around a little.  There you go.  Okay.  Oh, look, I found a little man in the boat.  Yeah, you like that bitch.  Yeah, look, she's screaming with pleasure.  Shut up, you poor bank.  There's the little look.  I'm gently, gently.  I peel back the hood,  and there it is,  waiting for the pleasure that is Mike Tyson. 
[02:14:30]  Left, right, left, right, left, right.  Uppercut, uppercut.  I'm saying uppercut,  but you know what I want to say.  Now Shannon's going to say something differently.  Oh.  Shannon, the opposite of what we were just saying.  Go ahead, Shannon.  This might be tricky.  Be careful how you say this.  Yeah, Shannon.  Yeah, I don't know how to say it.  Well, I just, when a guy goes south, I guess,  my friends and I don't want to say it.  Warning, warning, danger, danger, danger. 
[02:15:00]  I don't think that will make it through.  Yeah, yeah.  And you discussed this with your friends?  Are you guys all sharing the same guy?  No, we have just different guys that do that.  Could you tape your conversations  and send them to Opie and Anthony?  So instead of going for the little man in the boat,  he, you go for the tunnel. 
[02:15:30]  He plunges.  Yeah, like, that's what...  You go for the tunnel.  Like, that's what his thing is for.  Like, why is he doing that?  Ah.  And we just get, I don't know, it's irritating.  It's irritating.  That's just silly.  It's silly when you come up looking very pleased  and you're like, what?  Hmm.  Oh, really?  You kind of give a look like,  what are you doing, rookie?  Yeah, and you just got to push him back down,  hope he does better next time.  Push his head back down.  Get down there.  Get the job done, you rookie. 
[02:16:00]  Get down to look a champ.  You suck.  All right, Shannon, thank you.  All right, bye-bye, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to Lisa.  Hey, Lisa, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good.  Glad to know that ladies are listening to us, by the way.  It's such a welcome change instead of call after call  after call being guys.  Guys.  Sausage fest.  All right, what's up, Lisa?  It's bad enough when a guy calls out the wrong name during sex.  Yeah.  But I had this experience once.  Wait, wait.  You know what?  I see what you're going to say. 
[02:16:30]  You've got to be lying.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Go ahead, Lisa.  Oh, boy.  I was headed south on a guy.  Yeah.  I'm going to be tender about this.  And in the middle of it, he calls out,  Oh, Richard.  What are you doing in a situation like that?  No.  Oh, wow.  That was the end of it right there, let me tell you.  Oh, my God.  Does he have a friend named Richard?  I don't know.  And you don't want to know.  I do.  It was over at that point.  So what happened right after you said that?  I left. 
[02:17:00]  There was no turning back at that point, guys.  Oh, Richard's sister is so hot.  How do you call her for something like that?  Wow.  Oh, man.  That's bad.  That's classic.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Lisa.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Anna.  Anna, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Maybe he was just joking.  Yeah, hi.  Imagine pulling that gag on your chick.  Oh, Bobby.  You'll be pulling more than that gag, let me tell you.  For a long time. 
[02:17:30]  Anna.  Yes.  And what's up?  What's up?  Number one thing.  Girls do call into the show, but Stinky doesn't let them through.  But then also another thing is.  His name is Awesome Garrett, by the way.  Awesome Garrett.  Yes.  My Garrett is an Awesome Garrett.  Right.  Yes.  One mistake that guys make is that they mistake the belly button for the veg.  Stop it.  No.  Who's mistaking the belly button for the holiest of all region? 
[02:18:00]  Um, I have friends, and it's also happened to me, and I swear, I swear it happened.  No way.  What do you think, Mr. Magoo?  They get too into, like...  Bye, Georgie.  Huh?  They get too into the whole moment and everything, and they just want to, you know, place it in,  I guess, like, right away, and they have a face with a knee, and goes into the belly button.  Oh, you're so small and tight, you know.  Oh, Magoo.  There I go. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, that's quite a hairless little thing, aren't you?  Mr. Magoo.  Mr. Magoo, you put in belly buttons.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I can't see.  Maybe I need new glasses.  Magoo, you've effed it again.  All right, you guys suck, and Norton rocks, and it's so hot.  Wow.  Bye, Anna.  We're losing, Anna, but there's no way that's true.  Maybe you get, like, a junior high school, you know.  Going for the belly button instead of the area. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, and then, you know, you're all tanked up, and someone might do that.  I don't know how you mistake that.  It's a good five feet away.  You know what I mean?  Debbie.  Don't even close.  Yes.  What's up?  Well, you know when you're, um...  Oh, you know what?  Hold on.  Rob does make a good point.  Only if you're really fat, you mistake belly button for me.  Oh, that's true.  All right.  Go ahead, Debbie.  Okay.  Well, whenever you're going and giving oral pleasures to the guy...  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  ...and they get a little overzealous and gag you.  You mean my...  It makes us feel so good, though, man.  Why?  It's not that good for you.  Like, see, Donna's pet peeve is almost the same thing.  Donna's pet peeve on line five can lead to Debbie's pet peeve.  Oh, so why don't we get them together?  All right.  Let me get Donna...  Oh, sorry.  Hold on.  Let's try this. 
[02:20:00]  There we go.  All right.  Donna, you're on with Debbie.  Hi.  What's your pet peeve?  Uh, pretty much the same as Debbie's, but with the assistance of their hand on your head.  Exactly.  The hand on the head and any pushing that's done like that?  Mm-hmm.  It's not polite.  It's not polite.  No, not at all.  What about a good little petting the head?  Like, good job.  That's okay.  That always leads to pushing with the hand.  We can never just pet. 
[02:20:30]  We got to push a little.  Why do we always just want to bury it up to the yamban?  Right.  We could do that without the assistance.  Right.  Mike on line eight is saying, let's hear what these girls want us to do.  Well, it's sort of a process of elimination this way, you know.  You hear what they don't want and don't do it.  Well, we could take care of it.  Right.  So just sit there.  Don't be arching yourself and trying to take out your tonsils.  Yes, that's right. 
[02:21:00]  We'll get the message.  You know something?  Just let us do it on our own terms.  Sometimes that's just an uncontrollable reflex.  That whole pushing thing.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Another contestant from the Naughty Nighty Contest checking in, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I'm not going to say the number.  No.  ONA, I hate when guys insist on rolling me in flower before initiating sex.  Okay, I know the number.  That's not nice.  I remember that.  It's still fresh in our memory, the Naughty Nighty Contest.  That's not nice. 
[02:21:30]  Jessica, what's going on?  Hey, ONA, what's going on?  You tell us.  First of all, I got to say, the only time chicks get through is when you say, well, ladies  call in.  They do not let women through.  But I got to disagree with the, what's the, the little league mom?  Hold on.  No, chicks don't get through.  I can't tell you how many times I've called.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Get Awesome Garrett in here.  Yeah.  Because we'll clear this up.  Awesome Garrett is retarded, Garrett.  Awesome Garrett doesn't lie either.  Garrett, a lot of ladies saying that they can't get through to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:22:00]  They're lying.  The last girl that called, I put her on hold, but you guys didn't pick her up.  They think that I have the ability to put people on air.  Oh, okay.  So what they're saying is they're not getting on the air, but you're putting them through  if they have something good.  A lot of ladies saying that you just hang up on them because they don't have anything  for the show, really.  I can't tell you how many times I've gotten hung up on, and I've had things for the show.  All right.  Garrett, I think we should discuss this.  I think we should just put any girl through that wants to get through, no matter how bad  her story is. 
[02:22:30]  Okay.  Oh, no.  We got it.  Oh, no.  Let's let the ladies.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I think Awesome Garrett is doing a great job.  I do, too.  Yes.  Exactly.  The best house screener we've ever had.  Awesome.  Our Garrett is an Awesome Garrett.  There he goes.  Everyone puts their arms up and waves them back and forth on that place.  All right, Jessica, go ahead.  I got to disagree with the baseball mom.  Yeah.  Because she said that you shouldn't go right for it.  At the right moment, going right for it can make it that much better. 
[02:23:00]  You want a tip?  When you know that the lady is there, and I'll tell you when she's there, when it's all tight  and it's ready to go, if you go for it, you'll get it, and it'll be good.  Whoa.  I don't know what to do.  I have a horrible mouth, so I got to watch what I say.  Oh, potty mouth.  Oh, yeah.  I got a bad one.  Oh, potty mouth.  If you go right for it, you can't go right for it.  No, so you got to know when to focus on just the little man in the boat.  Exactly.  But if you go at the right moment, it's perfect.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah, I got it on O&A. 
[02:23:30]  Woo!  It's a whole timed thing, Opie.  You got to have clocks going and stuff and hourglasses, and right at the right moment.  It's like a shuttle launch.  Yeah.  Right at the right moment, you got to go for it, and everything will come together.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Okay, the biggest pet peeve, when you and a guy are going at it, and he pretends to slide  out, and then tries to sneak the backdoor action in, and he gives you this look like,  what?  I thought I had the right one. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, that old gag.  We have that sheepish grin on our faces.  Believe me, you guys know exactly what they're doing.  I know.  He goes, what?  It slipped.  What?  Exactly.  I didn't know.  That's funny.  Good job, Chris.  It slipped.  Everything's all slippery down there.  You try to keep this car on the road in the ice.  You know?  You don't know where it's going to go.  It's going in the ditch or the bushes.  You don't know.  I was skidding.  I thought I was going to hit the bush, and I hit the mud hole.  What happened?  Oh, no.  I'm heading for the bog. 
[02:24:30]  Heading for the bog.  Carla, what's going on?  Hi.  How you doing?  All right.  My pet peeve is when guys play with your boobies.  It's like they're bad radio knocks or something.  Oh, we like to call that tuning in Tokyo.  Well.  Twisting and turning.  Boo.  Boo.  I'm trying to hurt really bad.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Some guys just like Carla.  They're working.  I'm like, yeah.  Here's the old one-man bands.  He's got the drum on him and the horn. 
[02:25:00]  They're working women's parts like that.  Just tugging and hitting and blowing into and tugging and kicking.  Yeah.  He's hitting the cymbals on his head.  Girls are a fine-tuned machine.  You can't just be beating on the levers.  Quit bringing Vaudeville back.  Working a girl like the Whack-A-Mole game at Great Adventure or something.  All right.  We'll continue.  We've got to take a quick break here.  Ladies, keep calling.  And we'll give you the rest of the ones that made the magazine here. 
[02:25:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got to get right back to the phones.  Running out of show already here, man.  I know.  Ladies calling in with their pet peeves that we do, I guess, during sex. 
[02:26:00]  Things that they don't really like.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I just want to tell you there will be people playing in traffic tomorrow in front of BCN trying to get a couple wilds.  Oh, cool.  I just finished making my sign for tomorrow.  Yeah, we're going to have a lot of fun when we broadcast live from Boston tomorrow.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey, did you hear about...  Yeah, he didn't even win.  Did you...  All right.  Whatever.  Just want to remind people we're looking for the wildest or strangest thing that you can bring to WBCN for a trip to see MTV Icon starring Aerosmith in L.A. 
[02:26:30]  Just show up at BCN tomorrow between 3 and 7, 1265 Boylston Street in Boston.  Ant and I will decide what the wildest, craziest, strangest thing is tomorrow for a trip to L.A., okay?  And speaking of Boston, Chris G. from Boston said,  I heard women don't like it when you start doing your Iron Sheik impression while effing them.  Pleasure for me to be doing you in the real Greco-Roman style from Tirana Ran.  Greco-Roman wrestling champ who is man in both. 
[02:27:00]  I beat him like Hulk Hogan at the Madison Square Garden.  Chris.  Very good.  Also, looking for the ladies to show up tomorrow in Boston.  This isn't for the trip to L.A., but more fine prizes from the secret room.  Show us your Yasser.  Yeah.  Chachi and Oedipus getting us prizes for tomorrow's festivities.  You want to explain the show us your Yasser?  Well, ever since we saw the front page of one of the newspapers had a close-up picture, Yasser Arafat.  And it showed his mustache, and around his cheeks, he's got not even a beard or mustache. 
[02:27:30]  It's pubes.  Looks just like old lady pubes stuck to his face.  We just want you to dress your patch up like Yasser Arafat.  You know what I mean?  Like shave it in a little mustache, beard-type thing.  And maybe draw a couple of eyes and get that little tablecloth-type towel he wears on his head.  And maybe glue it to the upper part of it.  Just make it look as much like Yasser Arafat.  He's been in the news a lot, so you can see what he looks like.  Maybe go on to CNN.com or something. 
[02:28:00]  I guarantee we'll get at least one lady that will do that for us tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Laura Orban is checking in with her pet peeve.  Yes, Laura?  Hi.  I don't like it when guys are gentle with me.  I like it when they F me in the middle of 57th Street until I bleed.  Oh, my God.  Here's one for New York.  Thank you, Laura.  Thank you, Laura.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  Robin, what's up?  What's your pet peeve?  That's horrid.  Hello?  Go ahead, Robin.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, my God.  I love Opie.  All right.  I love him.  Listen, I had a bite.  I had a bite.  So you got big boobies?  What?  Sorry.  What did she say?  Sticky just wrote, this is why no women.  You know what?  Our Garrett is definitely an awesome Garrett. 
[02:29:00]  He is truly an awesome, awesome Garrett.  He's why?  He's more awesome than we thought.  Well, that's the whole thing about being awesome Garrett.  But we can never even know how awesome he is.  It's infinite awesomeness, I would think.  Yes.  And listen, he's got a bull pet.  Yes, annoying Robin.  Annoying.  Come on.  What do you have for the show?  Listen, I bought...  Awesome Garrett is making us suffer because we... 
[02:29:30]  I know.  ...and we're out on something.  Go ahead, Robin.  I bought a hairless cat because my man didn't know how to do it right.  Punch out.  What did she just say?  I bought hairless cats because my...  A cat's tongue?  Holy Jesus Christ.  I'm really trying.  I'm trying so hard.  Don't even do that.  Let Garrett do it. 
[02:30:00]  No, no.  Hold on.  Get Awesome Garrett in here.  I want to apologize to him.  Yeah, we owe Awesome Garrett such an apology.  Awesome Garrett.  I am so sorry that I questioned your phone screening ability.  Yes.  Awesome Garrett.  I want to apologize.  I should never, ever again question your awesomeness.  After all, it is you that runs this show.  Yes.  And I want to know that.  I am so sorry.  I accept your apology.  All right.  What do you think of the show today?  I love it.  You guys are awesome.  Shut up, Robin. 
[02:30:30]  We're asking Awesome Garrett.  What are you, Alan Sniffin?  You think it's all about you?  What?  Go ahead, Garrett.  What do you think of the show today?  It was an awesome show.  Thank you.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Thank you, Awesome Garrett.  And Robin, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Who did it?  Oh, my God.  Elizabeth.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, Anthony.  I'm in love with you.  Oh, great.  There we go.  You got cats?  No, come on, you guys. 
[02:31:00]  I'm fooling.  All right.  No, it's a rhythmic thing.  A rhythmic thing?  Right.  You guys like a little consistency there, the same rhythmic motion for a while?  Yeah, up, down, up, down, repeat.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, yes, but, you know, just don't jump all over the map.  You know, stay in one spot for a while.  Oh, a little consistency.  Thank you.  I got what you mean.  Thank you.  It's kind of similar to one that made the magazine here.  Number five, changing speeds fast.  Yes.  Ah.  Yes.  And this lady, Lynn, writes, when you're in the groove of sex, don't spring a sudden gear 
[02:31:30]  shift on us.  Right.  That's right.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  And I got to tell you.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  It says, make like the eagles and take it easy.  The only time a woman wants you to speed up is in the final 10-second countdown.  That's right.  And she'll tell you.  Don't worry.  All right.  Go ahead.  You have something about Awesome Garrett?  Awesome Garrett always lets me through.  Oh, because you have something for the show.  Well, he's a nice man.  No, he's awesome.  And I also have always called him Garrett. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Elizabeth.  A little consistency.  Let's go to Trish.  Yes.  Hey, Trish.  Hi.  Hey.  I have a peeve if you're doing a quickie.  Yeah.  I see.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I didn't say that.  No, no.  You see, you're using a little too much detail.  Okay.  It's getting too understandable to outsiders.  All right.  So what you want to say is during the quickie, if the guy decides to get it really going 
[02:32:30]  a little too soon, you know what I mean?  By starting the act a little too soon, that it can hurt you because there's nothing really  to glide stuff around with.  Yes.  All right.  Very good.  Yes.  Thank you.  That's not on the top five?  Not really.  Well, that stinks.  That's okay, though.  You guys rock.  You're cool.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:33:00]  Bye.  Let's go to Don.  Quick solution to the problems she was talking about.  Prison lube.  But what if you were the Iron Sheik?  Oh, yeah.  The Iron Sheik's got one, too.  Iron Sheik.  Pleasure for me to lube.  Ah!  Tough!  Pleasure for me.  Very dry today as I try Greco-Roman hold on you.  Let me fix.  Ah!  Tough!  Pleasure for me to lube.  Ah!  Tough!

[02:33:30]  Ah!  Tough!  Oh, you're like camel.  Dry.  Like desert.  Dry.  Let me fix.  Ah!  Tough!  Now it is pleasure for both of us.  Much pleasure.  This is what I did to Hulk Hogan.  Hulk Hogan.  Bent him over.  Pleasure for me to.  Ah!  Tough!  To Hulk Hogan.  At Madison Square Garden.  Madison Square Garden.  Greatest city on greatest radio station in the vault. 
[02:34:00]  And when I have to vault, I go.  Ah!  Tough!  Lube up.  Very good.  Pleasure for me.  And the opium Anthony man.  Ah, Donna, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey.  Men seem to think that their junk is a lot larger than it is.  Oh, God.  Ah!  And how do they do this?  I know.  I'll clean this up as best I could.  Yeah.  All right.  When they TS.  Oh, good, good.  Look at you with the alphabet.  And still want the girl to use her mouth. 
[02:34:30]  We are not contortionists.  It's not that big.  There's...  You just told me that you have B-cups.  Yes.  See, that's another thing.  That's why.  There's a combo action there.  It's the guy.  It might not be big enough, but neither are the boofies.  No, no, no, no.  Not B.  D.  Oh, you have D's?  All right.  Well, then, you know, there's no excuse.  Well, there's a way to accomplish that, then.  It's not comfortable. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Then she's got a...  Walk around like Ed Sullivan.  The head...  All right.  Let's go to Debbie.  Debbie, what's up?  Debbie?  Hello.  Hello.  Hi.  You're on the radio, Debbie.  Oh, my gosh.  Hi.  Oh, I don't have a pet peeve, but me and my boyfriend were messing around in the bedroom last weekend,  and we had something funny that we found out.  It was actually that time of the month, and we took his thing and put it in my armpit. 
[02:35:30]  As a joke.  Your armpit.  You know what?  What, were you eating crackers at the time?  Geez, throw him a bone.  Armpit sex is a popular fetish, my friends.  And it actually turned out we enjoyed it, or he enjoyed it, and we put some oil on it,  and it was nice.  You know what it's called?  What?  Axolism.  Oh.  Look at that. 
[02:36:00]  That's neat.  Gold star.  I didn't know that.  And some ladies will let their you-know-what grow in a little bit.  For extra pleasure for me.  For extra pleasure for me to have hairy armpit.  For extra pleasure.  That's okay.  Was it stubbly?  No, no, not at all.  But Axolism isn't the weirdest sex fetish, Anthony.  No.  There's also one called aculinctish.  What's that?  Where you get turned on by licking eyeballs. 
[02:36:30]  Ew.  What?  I thought it was pop your eye out and I'll scone.  All right, Debbie, thank you.  Thank you.  I think we have one more and then we're going to just move on here.  Then pleasure for me.  I just feel like they have to ask questions after.  Ask questions?  Hold on.  Melissa.  Hey, Melissa, what's up?  Not too much.  Okay, make it fast.  Okay.  Well, my thing was that I hate when they ask questions afterwards.  Ask questions.  Yeah, afterwards, like, I don't know what I can and can't say, but like... 
[02:37:00]  Are you staying?  Did you own?  It's like, if you don't know, then don't ask because you're going to get a lie anyway.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Do guys really ask that?  It's been asked before.  Did you?  No.  No.  Yeah.  But of course, you lie.  No.  You say, yeah.  Couldn't you tell?  It was when you were...  And that's when I...  Oh, oh, yeah.  I thought you did then.  Yeah.  I thought you did.  I think I felt something.  They play well with it thinking that they knew. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  And nothing happened in the first place.  There you go.  All right, Melissa.  Thank you.  One more, and then I think we got the last pet...  Frigid bitch.  Oh, no.  We got two that the girls didn't hit.  Yeah.  Amanda, go ahead real fast.  Hey, Melissa was so right, but also I wanted to say, the first time this happened, I didn't  even realize it happened.  Yeah.  A little down south and some yellow stuff, you know, came out instead of what's supposed  to.  No way. 
[02:38:00]  Yes way.  Isn't that like...  Isn't that kind of...  It was physically impossible.  No, no, no.  And he didn't even realize.  I realized.  It's not physically impossible.  We've all, you know, in the morning and stuff.  Then I realized it was sweeter.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  They're going to dump out.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, it's a little sweeter than what it was supposed to taste like, and...  Oh, no.  All right.  So that's your pet peeve.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to end this.  Thank you.  Maybe they're using that product that we endorse here on the Ovi and Anthony show.  They ain't endorsing anything until they get the copyright. 
[02:38:30]  We'll try that read again tomorrow.  Yeah.  Okay.  One of the sex mistakes that girls didn't hit on, saliva slurpees.  What is that?  When a guy's running his tongue all the way down my body, I picture the wet trail a slug makes.  I also don't like when a guy doesn't suck in all the extra saliva when we're kissing or when he's going you-know-where on me. 
[02:39:00]  Jesus, man.  Wow.  Ugh.  As opposed to not just let that stuff ooze out.  Basically, guys, we've got to control our saliva.  Make it fun.  Use a crazy straw.  Then you can see it going all wild directions.  Look, it's going around circles.  And number one, biggest sex mistake, ear-a-lingus.  Uh-oh.  I hate ear-tonguing.  Oh.  I hate that so much, Corey says. 
[02:39:30]  If I had to pick the most horrible punishment in my life, it wouldn't be ripping my fingernails off.  It would be someone sticking his tongue in my ear for some extended swishing.  Who the hell does that?  It's too loud and too slow.  Yeah, you know what that sounds like?  Up close?  It must look like...  And then she says, try this instead.  Stick to a little nibble on her earlobe or a little light breath in her ear. 
[02:40:00]  Like you're fogging up your glasses, not inflating a mattress.  There you go.  No, you don't...  All right.  You don't need a...  Because you know how sensitive your ear is.  Something could be very low.  Your what?  Your ear.  Your ear.  Your ear.  Your ear.  That's what I said.  Where you hear out of?  Your ear.  I would know how sensitive...  Your ear is sensitive.  No, no.  Your ear...  I'm hearing you.  Your ear could be very sensitive.  Your ear is sensitive. 
[02:40:30]  It's sensitive.  Yeah.  And when someone's just a mere inch or two away, it's a lot lower in volume than if they're  right in your ear.  You have people that close to your ear?  Sometimes, you know, someone will get close to your ear.  Yeah.  Maybe you're in a loud club environment and someone comes to whisper in your ear and,  you know, they got to get close and it's like, hey, you know, then before you know it, you're  plugging up your ear just so it's not getting yelled into too loudly. 
[02:41:00]  You could damage your ear that way.  That's what you call it?  Yelling?  What do we learn next?  Next, what did you learn today?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's. 
[02:41:30]  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  All right, all right.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show and it's time to play What Did We Learn on the  O&A Show?  I think I hit the wrong button there.  Sorry about that.  I'm trying to read all the what do we learn as fast as possible here.  I guess we thought you wanted to hear him a little bit.  I did want to hear him a little bit, but then I got confused when I hit that because I thought  we were going into something else and then, you know.  All right.  But I think we taught people a lot of things today because feedback is crazy for what do  we learn. 
[02:42:00]  Let's get right to it.  Pizza Guy Bill from somewhere that I can't pronounce.  Today, I learned that intercourse is like driving a car on an icy road.  Sometimes you slide into a muddy ditch.  Ed from Connecticut.  I learned today on the O&A Show I can make as much as Anthony by just bringing one of  my kids to the amusement park in New York.  Oh, there you go.  That's really good.  Jersey Gary.  I learned today not to yell out Richard when you're having sex with your girl.  You also learned Mount Everest climbing fees are there to keep the riffraff off the mountain. 
[02:42:30]  A dentist makes O&A quake in their boots.  Oh, very scared.  And lawyers didn't have a clue back in 1912.  Sheep Lover.  I learned today Pepsi will start to advertise on O&A when they come out with a dildo.  We did learn that.  Sheep Lover also learned the white stuff is much better than the silver stuff.  He also learned scuba gear makes everything okay.  Scott from Connecticut.  Lots of people from Connecticut today.  Scott learned never take the little man in the boat's hood off during the storm.  O&A's female listeners have hairy belly buttons. 
[02:43:00]  And last but not least, our Garrett is a chauvinistic Garrett.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Ann.  I'm sorry.  Today I learned, this is Chris, I learned that they don't like it, but they're still going  to get the hand on the back of the head.  I learned Anthony calls anal yelling.  I learned that a woman is a finely tuned machine and you can't be banging on the levers.  That's true.  Yes. 
[02:43:30]  And awesome Garrett is truly awesome and you should never question awesome Garrett because  he has the most awesomeness.  Right.  Jerry from Medicine.  I learned today O&A are not boring.  Dentistry is.  Number one is still number one.  Suck it, sniffing.  90 years ago, lawyers were slimy.  Slimy.  They just hadn't learned to apply themselves yet.  And hot button abuse is still not as bad as dump button abuse.  True.  And Paul from Philly, I learned today that I'm placing a wow flag on the top of the White  House because Secret Service won't mind a bit. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  I learned dolphins have less pet peeves than women do.  Kind of from today and yesterday.  A little of both.  Did you check to make sure no one said that line before?  Oh, oh.  Mark, what's going on?  Oh, a day.  What I remember on the show today is that Ed Sullivan actually perfected the proper head  position for T-F-ing.  Proper head for T-F-ing, a really big T-F.  A really big T-F?  You're just going to put the mouth right down here in the chest? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, you've got to, like, get your whole head down into your shoulders.  And then...  Actually, I may have had some orange brush myself, but I enjoyed it.  But then you have to make the Charles Bronson mouth, where you cover your teeth with your  lips like Charles Bronson.  Remember, girls, Ed Sullivan neck, Charles Bronson mouth.  Learned a little more today.  Thank you.  We only have a couple minutes here.  Rob, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  Good.  I learned two things today.  One, I'd still rather pay for it than try to remember all those stupid rules.  Yep.  And never doubt awesome Garrett. 
[02:45:00]  Right.  Never, ever, ever doubt awesome Garrett.  Michael, what's up?  Today, I learned that four out of five DJs say that the number one reason for tooth decay  in America is the New York message radio message board.  Very good.  Very good.  I bet Alan's that fifth pain-in-the-ass dentist that doesn't know any better.  Four out of five dentists surveyed say this is good.  Not me.  But I'm too busy obsessing about radio, so I don't know.  I hate to say I told you so, but I'm the hold-out dentist. 
[02:45:30]  Abney, what's up?  Four-eyed ethic.  Hey.  I learned that the belly button is five feet away from the veg.  Yep.  And pleasure for me to be on your...  I stink.  He messed it up.  But he gave the Norton I stink.  You got to respect that.  And it saved a bit.  I stink.  I want to end the show with the Iron Sheik.  Do we have time really fast?  Let us do Sheik.  Foot, you got to plug real quick before we're looking for this.  Yeah, I'm going to be at the Cinema Cafe with my buddies on 1325 2nd Avenue on 70th Street. 
[02:46:00]  We have a dinner show at 8.30.  The food's outrageous.  The show is at 10.  Please call 212-772-6400.  That's 212-772-6400 at the Cinema Cafe.  Look at you with your commercial voice.  Sure.  All right.  And tomorrow we'll be live at WBCN in Boston.  We can't wait.  We love going to Boston.  Yes.  We go there a lot, man.  Yeah.  It's kind of like we're still in Boston.  It truly is.  And tomorrow, don't forget, we're looking for the wildest, strangest, craziest, most unusual 
[02:46:30]  thing you can bring to WBCN for a trip to see MTV icon starring Aerosmith in L.A.  Just show up at WBCN tomorrow between 3 and 7 with your stuff.  Right.  We'll take a look and we'll decide, okay?  1265 Boyleson Street in Boston.  There's always a party going on outside the station when we're up there, okay?  And girls, dress up your patch like Yasser Arafat for prizes, too, for different prizes.  We just want one girl to be brave enough to do that for us.  That's all we're looking for.  One.  I just want to laugh my ass off when I say it.  We leave you with this.  This is Aaron Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation Champion. 
[02:47:00]  Pleasure for me.  Today, Anthony and Opium, they bring me to the WNEW.  WNEW is one of the number one station in Manhattan and New York, and pleasure to have come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, and hello to all people, to the wrestling,  to the WNEW station, number one radio station in New York, and pleasure to have been here. </pre>
