<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guests Jay Moore, Jim Norton, and Ronnie B, discussing the show's controversial nature and their own self-destructive tendencies.  A significant portion focuses on Jim Norton's prodigious pizza consumption, detailing his preferences for various New York pizzerias (Joe's vs. John's), interspersed with humorous exaggeration.  They also discuss Colin Quinn's recent comedy special, specifically a joke about Jews, and then transition to Richard Pryor's comedy specials, their varying lengths and quality.  Norton highlights his intense work ethic, recounting a grueling performance schedule involving multiple sold-out shows and an immediate gig at the Comedy Cellar.  The conversation shifts to Nortonâ€™s appearance on *Watch What Happens Live* and strategies for connecting with a gay audience.

The discussion turns to Charlie Sheen's stand-up performances and the perceived betrayal by their associate, Roland, for failing to secure them tickets and apparently sleeping through most of the day.  A humorous anecdote involving a bizarre Tracy Morgan interview and a rant about Doug Flutie is shared, further highlighting Roland's unreliability and habit of fabricating stories.  Roland's role in preventing show blow-ups is debated.  A disturbing anecdote about Jim Norton watching graphic videos depicting Mexican cartel violence, impacting his sleep and performances, is recounted, with brief details of the videos shared.  The conversation returns to Roland's unreliability and his penchant for inventing narratives.  The first segment ends with stories about childhood tree forts and a lengthy anecdote about comedian Davey Mack's strange Easter egg hunts, concluding with a discussion of Sidney Lumet's passing and his films *Network* and *Q&A*.

The next segment begins with comedic impressions and banter, including a failed Nick Nolte impression, featuring Paul Reiser, Jay Moore, and Ronnie B as in-studio guests, with Jim Norton also present. Anthony Cumia is absent, on a cruise.  The conversation shifts to Reiser's new show, its promotion, and comparisons to *Curb Your Enthusiasm*.  Reiser discusses his career, stand-up, and working with Larry David.  Off-color humor, including jokes about mothers and genitalia, ensues.  An audio bit about Cumia's car trouble and a makeshift repair is played. The discussion touches on Reiser's personal life, his children's humor, and his views on television and stand-up comedy. Bruce Springsteen is mentioned, along with a running joke about Reiser requesting "half slices" of pizza, deemed "gay" by Ronnie B. The segment concludes with more impressions and Bruce Springsteen's "Candy's Room," with the hosts and Ronnie B expressing their discomfort and amusement at Reiser's presence.

A subsequent segment focuses on a disastrous interview with Ron Bennington. Opie uses vulgar language ("tripping balls," "on mushrooms," "on acid") to describe his overwhelming laughter during the interview.  He expresses remorse over insensitive jokes about his child, revealing Bennington had an undisclosed personal situation that made the jokes inappropriate. The discussion details the interview's awkward moments, featuring references to Nick Nolte and a recurring "slices" gag. Anthony and Jimmy's attempts to salvage the interview are recounted, along with Bennington's discomfort with their comedic style. The conversation shifts to a bad interview with Dice, Mark Ruffalo and "The Kids Are All Right," and Nick Nolte impressions, detailing Bennington's awkward behavior.  The segment includes impersonations and discussions about securing Charlie Sheen tickets and a Bruce Springsteen song selection by Roland. It concludes with further discussion of the Bennington interview, replete with vulgar language and laughter.

A later segment discusses the film *Grown Ups*, its unlikeable characters and dick jokes.  The hosts discuss a perceived slight by Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, who appeared on Howard Stern but not their show.  A conflict involving Roland, who allegedly lied about the Foo Fighters' appearances and missed a Charlie Sheen outing due to sleeping after taking NyQuil (or DayQuil) at noon, leads to a heated exchange with Sam.  Booking difficulties and mentions of Russell Brand, Ryan Gosling, and Pat Smear are discussed.  Anecdotes about Rich Vos's karate kick, Ronnie's attempts to make guests uncomfortable, and a dispute between Roland and Fez over booking practices are shared.  The segment culminates with the surprise arrival of Louis C.K., preceded by a frantic search by Roland, and a discussion of a controversial Jay Severin comment about interns, along with other off-color jokes and anecdotes.

The final segment features a conversation with Louis C.K., promoting his show. He discusses production challenges, running out of material, and the improvisational nature of his process. The hosts offer to help filter his ideas. He recounts a viral interview with Donald Rumsfeld, highlighting Rumsfeld's non-answers and calm demeanor. Anthony's role in the interview is praised. The conversation touches on "half slices" of pizza, dog breeds' brain structures, and what dog each person resembles.  The impending Ricky Gervais interview is mentioned, along with a discussion of Gervais's past projects and comedy style, and anecdotes about a conversation with Gervais, Jerry Seinfeld, and Chris Rock.  The hosts and Louis C.K. discuss favorite comedians (Bill Cosby, Steve Martin, George Carlin), the evolution of stand-up, and the changing context of humor. The conversation is characterized by rapid topic shifts, profanity, and an informal tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cringe  style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended  from satellite radio. 
[00:04:00]  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  Yeah, the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you, 19?  I'm 18.  It's delicious.  You made springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, let's do this.  Good morning.  We've already done about 40 minutes of radio.  Jay Moore's in the studio.  And, of course, Jim Norton in the studio.  I certainly am.  And Ronnie B, I think, is going to be walking down that hall any second, too.  Opie in studio.  And I'm in studio.  I'm trying to wake the fuck up.  And I went to, I normally eat healthy at night.  And at like 10.30 last night, me and Colin, I let him talk to me and I'm going for pizza.  I haven't had pizza in a year.  Let's go get a pie. 
[00:05:00]  I had pizza, too, last night.  Dude, it was Joe's Pizza in the village.  So good.  Oh, my God.  I haven't had pizza.  You could eat a whole pie easy, right?  We each had two and left.  It was fucking.  Two pieces?  Yeah, two slices.  That's not that bad.  That's a start.  So you didn't really eat pizza, then.  It was so good, man.  Yeah.  Pizza fucking rules.  I haven't had it in so long.  What are you, like an alien?  No, but I know it's great, but.  I don't know.  That was the most innocent thing. 
[00:05:30]  There's just pure, sweet innocence out of a little Jimmy.  Pizza fucking rules.  It was like, you're looking at fucking tits for the first time.  Whoa.  I had just forgotten.  Five years old or something.  Jesus.  But I don't eat pizza that often.  Like, I don't.  It's one of my most amazing foods when I eat it.  Holy shit.  That was my favorite thing you've ever said.  Thank you.  Pizza.  But it was so sincere.  Yeah.  It was so delighted.  And believe me, when I'm at the hotel and I look at like the room service menu and I 
[00:06:00]  can't make up my mind, my wife will just go, pizza party?  And I'm like, as soon as it's said, you have to do it.  Pizza party.  Yeah, pizza's so good, man.  You get fucking ways to come up and you fold the two slices on top of each other.  Oh, nice.  And you can't put enough garlic on that shit.  Joe's?  Joe's, you have to go by the pie.  They're amazing.  No slices.  Is Joe's better?  I don't know.  There's John's down there.  John's, I'm sorry.  John's is John's.  Oh, no.  John's is like the second best pizza joint in all of New York.  I think there's one that beats him out in Brooklyn.  Yeah, John.  I know what you're talking about.  Patsies.  And how did you only get two slices?  You have to order a pie. 
[00:06:30]  I just eat at the cellar.  No, no, no.  This is Joe's.  You can eat by the slice.  Wait, did you go to Joe's or John's?  We went to Joe's.  John's around the corner.  Oh, okay, okay.  What the fuck?  You fucking Disney.  You were that close to John's and didn't go to John's?  We didn't want a whole pie, I think.  And we were.  Throw the rest out.  Who gives a fuck?  Give it to the homeless guy.  Plus, my car had to be moved by 11.  I was on McDougal Street in one of those spots.  It was 1035.  If I see the car, you want to ride home?  Your pizza eating sucks.  No, my pizza eating was phenomenal. 
[00:07:00]  Get two slices and you have to hurry up because your car might get towed.  Colin was kind of like, he's like, he decided to go for pizza.  I'm like, I'll go with you.  And no, I was only going to have one.  He goes, let's get it to go.  So we could just walk.  Because if I stay, I'll have two.  But then I kind of see.  What do you want to walk and talk like newlyweds?  Yeah.  Likes.  Long walks to the village with pizza.  Dislikes.  Cars being towed.  That was almost Colin.  I'm not up to it yet.  Almost.  Cars being towed.  Ronnie B.  Hey, look.  Bonnie, the new director. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, Bonnie, the new director is here.  What's up, Ronnie?  We're talking about Jimmy's pizza eating.  I really just rediscovered pizza last night.  I haven't had it in a long time.  But he said, what did he say, Jay?  How did he say it?  He goes, pizza's fucking awesome.  It's true.  It really is.  Yeah, but he's 40-something years old.  I haven't eaten it my whole life.  But I just haven't had it.  You know, you don't have something in a while and then you have it again and you're like,  Jesus Christ, I forgot.  Where'd you get it from?  Joe's.  Either Joe's or John's.  On 6th Avenue, right there.  Oh, yeah.  But he was right next to John's and didn't go to John's. 
[00:08:00]  Joe's is good, though.  John's is good.  Ridiculous.  What about Jeff's?  Jeff's.  Jeff's is terrible.  Hey-oh.  G-E-O-F-F.  No good.  You know, just admit that we don't have good pizza in Manhattan anymore.  No, we don't.  What?  It fucking blows.  No, I disagree.  No, you gotta go to the outskirts.  Ronnie B's right.  You gotta go down the village.  There's no Italians left.  There's no Italians left in New York City.  You gotta go over the bridge to Brooklyn.  You know, Anthony Bourdain's has all the chefs in all the places.  It's all like Central American people anyway.  Ronnie's right. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Will.  Thanks for that.  Well, no, because we had awesome pizza and you agreed with him the whole time.  That's what.  Then someone cooler walks in.  It's not like that.  It's like the fucking playground.  You know, like when Ronnie says, here comes a fifth grader.  Yeah, pizza stinks.  You gotta go on the outskirts of Manhattan.  I'll give it.  The outskirts of Manhattan still have it.  I think Jersey has better pizza.  Spanish Harlem and Wall Street?  There you go.  Perfect.  That's perfect.  I will say this.  My pizza eating experience was not to be sullied. 
[00:09:00]  It was fantastic.  But he had to rush his pizza eating because his car was going to be toted.  Eleven.  Yeah, so me and Dummy just stood there and ate fucking two slices each.  How great would it be if he just went Colin?  Colin's on top of the world today after a special at the other day.  I saw it.  I didn't see the aired special.  Look, the trailers look great.  Yeah, it was terrific.  He was wearing a purple shirt.  On YouTube, the clips I saw, I was like, it was just a little, it was good, but not like, 
[00:09:30]  and I'm the biggest Colin fan in the world, so I hope it was as great as I'm wishing it would.  I saw him shoot one night and it was fantastic.  I saw the clip where he says, everywhere the Jews go, they get kicked out of it.  He goes, that's why shalom means hello and goodbye.  He's like, hey, how you doing?  Shalom.  All right, we'll be out of here in a minute.  I was watching the whole thing going, I can't wait until he gets to the United States.  I'm so excited when he gets to us, the United States.  It took forever, Rodney.  It did.  It took a long time.  It took way too long.  It was a long special.  It's not an hour special.  It was like, what, hour 20?  Really?  I think it was about hour 20.  I haven't even heard of that. 
[00:10:00]  Hour 20, yeah, the old school.  Well, because it's more like a play.  It's more like a...  This is fucking delicious.  Police pizza's great.  It could be a great opener for you.  Yeah, that's how these, the Pryor's special was like an hour 18, the great live concert.  The best hour recorded.  Ever, yeah.  They always used to be over an hour, and then they became an hour just because I guess  that was HBO's schedule and was easier for them.  The whole thing, when you see like old Pryor, or you listen to old like Pryor albums, the  thing, I always say Carlin is the best, to me, is like the best of all times, because 
[00:10:30]  there's no like real pieces of shit in the bunch.  There's some you don't like more than others, but like with Pryor, there's like four albums  where he's just talking fucking heroin gibberish, and everyone in the audience is like,  oh, shit, you're crazy.  It's probably because they were laugh records.  They were released probably by different ones than Warner Brothers.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had the ones where he did like the, you know, like That Nigger's Crazy and Something  I Said, and then he had the ones like The Wizard of Comedy, which was a laugh record one.  Like there were other ones that kind of compiled things, I think.  He got the, he got the hour, like lighting yourself on fire, shooting the car, it sounds like 
[00:11:00]  a Metallica set list, like smoking crack, like I shot my car, and it made sense to me because  my wife was going to leave me, and I said, not this motherfucker, you ain't?  Like that's, like he got the greatest hour, like he got 16 ounces of water into a 14 ounce  glass.  Like there's no room for, there's no improvement.  Oh, I see, like extra water.  Now I get it.  That's extra talent, I just threw it in.  Look, Ron, let me tell you, you're wrong about pizza.  No, no, I'm with you guys on the pizza thing. 
[00:11:30]  You should get a salad with it, though.  It's not really nice.  How long did it take you to eat the pizza, Jimmy?  Five minutes?  Not even.  Not that long, no.  I see his pizza eating sucks.  No, well, we gotta sit down and enjoy your sauce.  Fuck that.  You gotta get a whole pie.  I crushed.  I get a whole pie.  It takes me about five minutes.  Look at my gut, Opie.  I hadn't had it in a while.  I just, it was so fucking, it was a perfect crust.  It was crisp, and it was like leaking out. 
[00:12:00]  It was like drippy pizza.  And then Colin got another one, and I had to go with him.  And I had a nice fucking ice-cold Diet Coke.  Plenty of aspartame from my gums and brain.  Nice.  Fantastic.  Beautiful.  Really a good experience.  And this was after Columbus?  No, this was after the cellar.  I did spot the cellar last time.  I went down to the comedy cellar.  Wait, you flew home from Columbus yesterday morning?  Yes.  And then went to the cellar to do more comedy,  even though you had five sold-out shows in Columbus?  Yes.  I want to work on it.  That's a work ethic, sir.  Yeah, I did, it was great spots in Columbus,  but I want to work on it and add some stuff to my act. 
[00:12:30]  I'm so sick of my fucking voice.  I want to just do new material now.  Yeah, but you did five sold-out shows.  Sure.  It's great.  Enjoy.  Well, you know what it is, you get...  I do enjoy it, but it's my job.  Yeah, the thing that you forget is that they...  That's like a real battle.  It's like, you've got to go out there and do your second show,  and you're like, fuck, I just said all this shit,  and I'm so tired of it.  And you have to really psych yourself up like,  oh, wait a minute, they've never heard this before.  Right. 
[00:13:00]  To me, that's the high-wire act of not slitting my fucking throat on the road.  And you've got to make believe you're saying it for the first time.  Yeah, that's the whole game is I'm making this up.  It sure is.  I'm going to be at Gotham tomorrow night.  You coming by?  I'll go.  It's late for you, though.  Why are you going to Gotham?  Just to work out some shit?  To fucking make a living.  Yeah, you're off on Wednesday.  Tuesday or Wednesday.  Yeah, I'll fucking go, that's right.  Get some pizza after.  We're going to get some pizza.  I know a place.  Fuck, Ryan and some Chelsea gay pizza.  Chelsea gay pizza.  Chelsea gay pizza.  Chelsea gay pizza.  I was on Watch What Happens Live last night. 
[00:13:30]  Let's see if I can get some fucking gays now.  There you go.  I'm always saying, where the fuck are my gays?  Like Kathy Griffin and all these people are like,  She's got plenty of them.  Where are my gays at?  And I'm like, you know, I'm wearing a Nermez scarf  with that white jacket you saw me walking in a teacup Yorkie.  Like, how much gay can I be?  Open with Chelsea pizza.  That can be your bet.  Chelsea gay pizza.  The whole punchline is just...  Tripping out of the crust.  Do you have half slices?  And then fucking everyone goes crazy.  Because a false slice is too matchy-matchy.  Too much. 
[00:14:00]  It's just too much.  Too much.  Too matchy-matchy.  What do you have to do to get the gay audience?  Because they are phenomenally a good audience.  They go fucking crazy.  They're loyal, right?  I think they're loyal too, Jay.  I think you have to dish more.  Like, you gotta really spill it on people.  Stay on page six.  Don't get off the fucking page six.  Yeah, I went to...  You know, I'm trying.  But my wife and I are very dull in a great way.  Like, we lay in bed, watch Law and Order.  We don't cheat.  We don't drink.  We just fucking hang out.  Way to drop in Law and Order since you... 
[00:14:30]  Oh, no, not picking...  No, it's smart though.  It's good.  Because it's all over.  You're playing Charlie Sheen on Law and Order.  Everybody's talking about it.  Duh.  Spinoff.  And there's a lot...  There's talk about you replacing Regis.  What?  Yeah.  It's out there.  It's out there.  It is.  There was talk of me replacing Charlie Sheen three years ago.  Don Ivers told me...  Oh, by the way.  He goes, I fucking love those guys.  I go, you...  There's fucking mics everywhere.  We don't know why he's obsessed with us.  I don't know why he likes me so much. 
[00:15:00]  I met him once and now I can't get rid of him.  He goes, those guys did a thing for me.  Those motherfuckers are so goddamn funny, man.  Oh, I know why.  Because we're one of the only radio shows that fucking stood up for him.  Yeah.  He's like...  Supported him.  I'm sure Ronnie did too, but...  When he's on the fucking...  I thought he went too far.  I realized as I was saying that we had another big radio show in the studio.  You know, I thought he went too far.  I just thought, you know, nappy was such an awful word.  I have a niece who's nappy, and I just... 
[00:15:30]  You know what?  I didn't even know that.  So, if I've said it around you, I'm sorry.  You have a couple times.  Really?  Yeah.  But if she's a niece, it could have been that she was tired.  That's true.  Nappy.  Nappy.  It's clever, not funny.  It's clever.  No, it is.  I like it.  Perfect.  Perfect.  So, that was perfect, Jay.  Beautiful.  This is our random fucking Opie, Anthony soundboard message.  Hey, don't put any...  I did it.  Yeah.  It's fucking deep.  Because last week, you were doing great by just going blind, and then you fucking put  the thing to know where it was.  How do I switch the channel to a whole different thing? 
[00:16:00]  Danny or somebody else will fucking do it.  No, no, no, no.  We're...  Not yet, but later.  Danny?  All you do is hit the...  Danny was on it like an IT guy.  He was running over there so quick.  Now, Charlie Sheen.  Fucking Roland, Ronnie, blew me off.  I could have went to the Charlie Sheen show last week.  You know why?  I heard it was phenomenal.  Because he knows your allegiance is with Fez.  That's what it has to be.  I heard it fucking killed.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he fucking bombed on Friday.  Who gives a shit?  Last night, he kills Daryl Strawberry, and James Lipton went on stage with him. 
[00:16:30]  It's like, what?  Who put fucking angel dust in my Diet Coke at the concession stand, where I'm sitting  here watching fucking James Lipton, Daryl Strawberry, on stage with Charlie Sheen,  and he's fucking killing.  And the Knicks come back from fucking 20 down, and they pull shit out in a meaningless game.  Like, what the fuck is going on?  Look at the game tape!  Look, I would have a full report, but Roland took some NyQuil, was his excuse, and he fell  asleep at, what, three in the afternoon and just woke up.  I took some NyQuil for a couple years.  Yeah, but I was sitting around all day waiting for my Roland call, because he said, yeah, 
[00:17:00]  we're going to Charlie Sheen.  I got a hookup.  Where is he?  Because now he's hiding.  Because I could have had a full report today.  He didn't want you to come with him.  Danny, will you pull up Tracy Morgan, Doug Flutie?  Have you ever seen that?  No.  What?  Somebody's interviewing Tracy.  I just screamed, look at the game tape, and it's from Tracy Morgan.  Somebody's interviewing him, and in the middle of the interview, the interviewer goes, yeah,  you've got to look at the game tape.  And Tracy, like, great psychosis.  There's no switch.  You don't see the person change. 
[00:17:30]  And Tracy's like, how the fuck are you going to be great if you don't study greatness?  And the guy goes, you've got to look at the game tape.  And Tracy just becomes like a high school football coach.  He goes, look at the game tape!  No, I...  Put some pads on somebody!  I don't give a fuck if a Joe teammate!  I swear to God, Darrell Bonelli, if you pull that Doug Flutie shit again!  And he goes through this whole thing.  I don't know if you guys get...  I mean, it's something you might become obsessed with.  Before we play this, he did this during the Virus Tour while comedians were on stage trying 
[00:18:00]  to do their act.  Doing the high school football coach?  Right behind the fucking curtain.  What a fucking tool.  I forgot who was on stage, but they walked off really pissed off.  What a more successful than me jerk.  Because you can hear Tracy Morgan entertaining everyone backstage.  Well, then never mind.  I stink.  Is the football coach that only has one ball?  No!  He just gets obsessed with Darrell Bonelli through a fucking Hail Mary.  We might have won the game if it wasn't for God damn Doug Flutie.  I said 23, dive right, and get back in the huddle. 
[00:18:30]  No, he added that to it.  For his character, his character has one ball and is dying of ball cancer, and that's why  the team has to win.  I swear to God, but really, like, great psychosis, you don't see any switch.  Then you used to tell cats, join in!  Join in!  Break up the tension.  No, you said, though, you know, you used to say, uh, chemistry.  Like, you used to want, blend!  If you see me doing this, play the air guitar to blend!  Blend in with it! 
[00:19:00]  Go with your mind in detail.  Flow with it.  Learn how to do the, study!  Do your homework!  I always tell y'all, do your homework!  Get footage!  Footage.  How the fuck you gonna know how to be great if you don't study greatness?  Flow with it.  Now, look at the game tape.  Look at the game tape!  Hit somebody, goddammit!  I don't give a fuck if it's your own teammate!  Lay some pads on somebody!  I swear to God, Darby Nellie, if you start that Doug Flutie shit again, and when I call 
[00:19:30]  23,000, call the goddamn plate!  I didn't say Hail Mary!  You ain't Doug Flutie!  You ain't Doug Flutie!  Stop that Doug Flutie shit, Darby Nellie!  Just call the goddamn plate and get in the huddle!  Crazy, okay.  What's this Doug Flutie shit?  The two back to the goddamn three-hole!  That's all I said!  And I said cold time out! 
[00:20:00]  Lord, can I put square block out?  That's all I said!  You can say something Doug Flutie shit!  They're not yet spent at all.  Call the Doug Flutie shit out!  I can't get back to Doug Fluties!  We might have won the game if it wasn't for Doug Flutie!  No, it's insane!  If it wasn't for my damn Doug Flutie!  Hey, yo, listen, listen.  Is that what he did at Provider Show?  No, he becomes the old high school football coach with one ball.  Look at the game tape!  That's different.  That's different.  And those guys are sitting around, I'm like Sonny and Red and Joe Esposito. 
[00:20:30]  Just fucking loving everything.  Yeah, you gotta do some karate, Elvis.  Yeah.  That was good, Elvis.  That was fucking good, Elvis.  Yeah, why don't you go up to your bedroom and watch some surveillance tape for your guests?  It's like visiting.  Now we go to Roland.  Roland.  Yes.  You let me down yesterday.  I was waiting for the phone call.  I figured the Masters are over.  I'm gonna get the phone call from Roland.  What a Masters, gentlemen, huh?  And I'm gonna go see Charlie Sheen with my friend Roland.  Between you two, I got sick during the weekend.  What are you talking about?  I don't like when people...  You were sick.  How do you know I got you sick?  Well, then I and I are sick.  And why are you not sick today?  I was stuffed up, but I've been taking NyQuil all week. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, but you're not stuffed.  Did you go to the show, though?  No.  I was asleep.  You weren't sick enough to blow off Charlie Sheen.  You never had tickets to Charlie Sheen.  Did you tell Drunk old ladies you're Louis De Palma?  No.  I was delivered.  Your wife's peach slop gives me the trots.  Oh, Riga.  I have not once yet delivered.  Not even a phone call.  I was asleep.  The whole day?  Yeah.  NyQuil.  What time did you fall asleep?  Around noon.  You've been asleep since noon. 
[00:21:30]  Something's wrong with this story.  Well, I woke up noon.  I woke up again around 7.30 and took another shot.  That was as good as pizza.  Thank you.  You've been asleep.  You never saw Shane.  You didn't wake up once to think maybe I was wondering if we're going to Charlie Sheen.  Around 7.30, took another shot and then passed up.  I wanted to give a full report on this dumb show.  Here's the thing, too.  I never let him down.  Name me once another time.  Last night.  That's it.  It only takes once.  What do you think a rapist ever fucking says, I just did it once? 
[00:22:00]  He gave me the new Paul Rises.  It's just a tip.  Here's the deal.  He gave me the new Paul Rises show to check out, so that's not letting me down, but not  having tickets to Charlie Sheen.  Did you see a Gervais show?  How's that not letting you down?  I liked it.  I thought it was great.  I was surprised how much I liked it.  We were supposed to go to Charlie.  I'll make out to you.  I apologize.  Do you like the cartoon show he does on HBO?  I haven't seen it.  I would like it.  I like...  The thing I don't like is the cartoons.  The stories are so fucking great.  I wish I was watching three guys tell these stories. 
[00:22:30]  Instead of the animation.  Right.  Well, Carl is just an amazing character.  Did you see...  He had a buddy of his, had headphones on.  His real tall friend.  Merchant.  Merchant.  Steven Merchant.  I think it was him.  He had headphones on.  He was listening to like the Smiths and he had his eyes closed and he was jerking off  in his bedroom and when he woke up, his mother had put fucking cookies next to the bed.  He fucking blew a load of jizz all over himself.  Not when he woke up.  When he was done jerking off, he looked over there.  There was like fucking...  There was fresh biscuits. 
[00:23:00]  Like he just fucking...  When his eyes closed and his mother came in and just shut shit down next to him and left.  Emilio Estevez was last night, so he came out on stage with him.  No.  Yeah.  No.  It was fucking amazing.  There's no way.  I was surprised that they said Martin was there too.  I'm like, why would he be a part of that?  They did a fucking Men at Work tribute when they allowed to enter.  They did three scenes from the old Men at Work.  They came out with trash cans and you fucked it up, dude.  I can't believe we were going to Charlie.  Charlie, you made Opie miss Emilio Estevez. 
[00:23:30]  I'll make it up.  That was going to be my big thing tonight.  Emilio and Carlos together again.  How?  Can you get Charlie in here?  That would be making it up.  Yeah.  Let's get Charlie in here.  Which hotel is he staying at?  Just call five hotels that he'd be staying at.  He's playing at the Trump place.  Call him up.  He's probably under a different name.  You slept since noon.  Probably not.  When did you wake up?  He's the type of maniac to be like, get someone up here.  Let him call, man.  Good impression.  Jimmy did it great.  He woke up at nine, conveniently. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  Right in the middle of the Charlie Sheen shot, so it's too late to call me.  That's true.  The whole story, something's going on.  What did Daryl Strawberry do on stage last night?  See, I would have the answer to all this.  Everybody chanted Daryl at him and he started crying and ran off.  He tried to do a set.  Daryl!  Is there a better heckle in the history of fucking sports than just Daryl?  It's your own name.  Oh my god.  Can you think of a better one? 
[00:24:30]  I mean, when David Justice came to bat in the division championship series at Yankee Stadium,  he just got caught cheating with a hooker on Halle Berry.  And I'm always obsessed with, how do 40,000 fucking people get a chant at the same time  without the scoreboard going, hey, ho, let's go.  And everyone just starts going, Halle Berry, Halle.  And then like the next inning, Manny's hit list.  And I'm going, holy shit, Manny's 0 for 18 in the series.  Like, how the fuck does that happen?  That's funny.  Who started? 
[00:25:00]  Your name is Daryl.  It's texting.  They're fucking texting each other.  It's the internet.  It was before the texting, Ronnie.  That's true.  They were able to figure it out without the phones.  That's true.  Which makes it more amazing.  All right, Roland, you let me down.  What can I tell you?  Jimmy, did you get any toppings on your pizza?  I did not.  I put it.  You know what?  I'm very dry today.  No, no, no.  I don't believe in that.  I had a little salt on it, which I normally wouldn't do.  Because the cheese doesn't have enough of that for you.  That's right.  It's very abnormal for me to add salt.  As everyone knows, I never add salt.  Everyone just knows it about me. 
[00:25:30]  I don't do it.  Likes, long walks in the village with pizza, dislikes, salt.  Yeah.  But I'm very dry.  I had a splitting head.  I didn't sleep well at all.  I just kept waking up.  You've never been sleeping well in a long time.  I literally slept when I got home from the flight yesterday.  I saw a video over the weekend.  It's been giving me nightmares.  Why do this to yourself?  I don't know.  Rich Voss, live at Gotham?  Look at the black chick checking me out.  He watches the sickest shit. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  I can't do it.  Very, very bad stuff.  Which one did you see?  Just Mexican cartel murders.  Why?  Why would anybody fuck with those guys?  They're the scariest people on the planet.  You want a good night's sleep?  Watch The Real Housewives of New York or something.  That'll put you to sleep.  Not this cartel shit.  I literally just kept waking up thinking about them.  Why would you watch that?  Why?  Like, they're going to come in your fancy dormant apartment?  No, I wasn't having nightmares about them.  I just...  You get me home?  You get me home?  You get me home?  You get me home?  I just kept waking up. 
[00:26:30]  What were they doing to these gentlemen?  They've just been beheading people.  You love the beheading people.  I don't love them.  I've never seen a beheading on the YouTube.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  This one, the guy was hanging upside down naked.  And I imagine...  What happens is funny already.  The rival cartels are trying to out-macab each other.  And they fucking...  The guy's alive.  They cut his dick off while he's alive.  And then they behead him.  It's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen.  I saw it before the Saturday second show.  I almost couldn't do my show.  It bothered me so much, I couldn't leave the hotel. 
[00:27:00]  It was horrible.  Oh, my God.  I was terrible.  You're a fucking maniac.  It was terrible.  That's terrible.  And then you went on stage and did my show.  Did you think about it during your show?  Yes.  Oh, it was awful.  You're a lefty?  Mexican cartel.  Mexican cartel.  He's beheading the girl lefty.  You're a lefty?  Oh, God.  It was disturbing, man.  Fucking horrible.  That's fucking horrible.  It's like a life changer.  Ronnie, you watched any of that stuff?  No, I don't.  But I would seriously tell those guys I pay them back in two days. 
[00:27:30]  What the fuck does it do?  They cut off my hat.  I'm telling you, I get the fucking money back at the hotel.  No money isn't here.  I'm here just to discuss the deal, and that's it.  Then another guy's going to come in.  You go, Roland, completely fuck this up for us, guys.  Fucking Roland.  I was here to tell you.  I was taking NyQuil.  I didn't believe a fucking bit of that story, though, did you?  He's living a double life.  I think he is, too.  I don't disagree with Ronnie.  When Roland tells me things, I go, is this going to be in the book of lies by Roland, or is this true? 
[00:28:00]  I have to call him out.  Are there more than that?  Is that a common thing?  Roland is amazing.  Don't get me wrong, but I question some of the things he tells me.  So I go, is this going to be in the Roland book of lies, or is this a real thing?  Roland's a great booker, horrendous human.  And a horrible friend, obviously.  He'll get you like...  Who goes to sleep at noon knowing that someone's waiting for a phone call?  He gets us great guests.  And then you'll say, what about so-and-so?  And he'll be like, Roland is good, because he doesn't want us to blow people up on the air. 
[00:28:30]  He's smart.  So he'll tell us, hey, we were supposed to get fucking Charlie Sheen snapped, but he had to fly.  This book, his rep just called me.  It's like, it's six in the morning.  No one just called you.  Now he's on a plane.  He just goes...  He just defuses everything up.  That shit brings me to physical violence when people talk that way.  But the way he talks?  Like when they just have pull shit out of thin air, like, yeah, you know, the thing is, that's the deal.  But if he doesn't do that, we blow it up on the air, and we never...  Like, he's in a tough position, because it's a very self-destructive show. 
[00:29:00]  We haven't been that bad lately.  How do you figure?  Just in general, I'm saying.  We've been pretty good lately.  Yeah.  But we're the fucking boyfriend that's always getting our ass kicked at the bar, and he's just trying to get us out of there.  What was the last one we blew up?  Oh, I don't even know.  But, you know, I mean, in general, he's just looking out.  Didn't you show Norm Macdonald the door to get a...  No.  Norm was leaving.  He wasn't leaving.  That was the funny part about that day.  He just wandered around.  I was going to hang out.  As we're trying to get Brock Lesnar.  Sports show about hoarding. 
[00:29:30]  You know, nobody threw Norm out.  He wandered around.  He was standing here taking photos.  I just asked him to take the photo right outside.  I only go by what the message boards say.  Oh, well, they're usually right.  Yeah.  Well, he did get you 11 minutes with Sinbad the other day.  Sure did.  Where, in the middle of talking to Sinbad, you're like, Sinbad has to leave.  We just started.  Why bother?  Oh, you weren't here for that?  I was like, wow, Ronnie's so fucking funny, man.  I swear to God.  God damn it.  Opie, keep him quiet.  When you said that, I was like, fuck, Ronnie's funny. 
[00:30:00]  Sinbad's got to go.  Sinbad has to leave.  Ronnie was sitting in.  If you're bald-headed on Monday.  Jay, listen to this.  I like Sinbad.  It was great, man.  It was a fun interview.  No, Ronnie is great.  Ronnie's sitting in.  Fucking Sinbad is late, so we finally get him in.  We're just getting started.  He has to go.  It was the fucking weirdest thing ever.  And Sinbad was name and names.  I couldn't believe that he brought up the fucking, who was doing the coke.  He was ready to go.  Yeah, he was great.  He was ready to go.  Where did he have to go to? 
[00:30:30]  A bunch of other interviews.  But shows that mean nothing around here.  Shady.  He had to go to Shady.  You were late.  Shady.  Oh, man.  Backspin.  Beat Street.  Breakdown.  Yo, we're here to man Sinbad.  Holla, son.  That's a good song, too.  Beat Street.  Breakdown.  I wouldn't let you down, Jimmy.  Fucking from Beat Street.  Little Yimmy Norr.  Yo, I paint three of them murals for some of that ass.  Yo, what's up with your girlfriend?  What's up with her?  That was like the real breakdance movie where breaking was for fags.  Beat Street was for the one who really understood breaking.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jimmy. 
[00:31:00]  Ozone?  That's the way they look at it.  I don't see it.  I like Ozone and pop and fucking Turbo.  Oh, I like both.  And Ice-T was in it.  Was he?  He was a DJ at the house party.  I just like, first of all, there's always a rec center that needs to be saving.  I've never seen a rec center in real life in my life.  Third of all and fifth of all, there's always like some classically, it's like the Crossroads  where like fucking Ralph Macchio just goes in there and does like fucking Mozart on his  guitar.  There's always like some girl that does like the fucking splits and the reverse handstand 
[00:31:30]  and they're like, whoa, she got crazy mad moves.  Because she does like real ballet.  Did they get the money for the rec center though?  That's the important thing.  They didn't.  Always do it at the end.  In Breaking 2, Electric Boogaloo.  Right.  Not in Mannequin 2, On the Move, they didn't.  And not Arthur 2, On the Rocks.  Well, also in Beach Street, obviously Ramon died and that changed everything.  Yeah.  Not to spoil it.  Here comes Roland down the hall again.  I got it, TiVo.  Don't fuck this up.  I think Roland's coming with proof now. 
[00:32:00]  Where'd the guy go?  Was that the fucking Charlie Sheen show?  You, that guy.  I was going to go to him.  He couldn't wait around.  Now, what does Roland got?  He's got papers now.  I got a photo of him asleep.  It's time stamped from yesterday.  Is he coming in?  No.  Yeah, he is.  I just said no because I didn't have an answer.  All right, you got papers.  What do you got now?  Here's his papers.  Thank you.  When we were kids, we had a, you know, and you have like a fort in the woods.  Yeah, sorry.  You get all your Playboys in there?  Yeah, of course.  And we had this one kid.  In the bags. 
[00:32:30]  Like, Louis Caberson.  He was like rolling.  And some, Billy Morales' mom came out.  You don't remember any of the names.  Why don't I send him?  And said, I know you guys got Playboys in here.  And we're like, don't.  Like, look around.  And we hit him on this giant fucking rock.  And she goes, all right.  Then I apologize.  A mom said this.  Then I apologize.  And Louis Caberson pulls the rock back.  He goes, there's nothing under here but a bunch of papers.  He did not do that.  Why would I have a fucking, why would I make that?  What an idiot.  Nothing under here but a bunch of papers.  That was always the problem, though.  Where were you supposed to hide? 
[00:33:00]  The only reason why you had a fort is because you had some skin magazines.  But then it's not like there's a fucking closet in there.  You're just like, now what do we do?  You buried him.  But you put him in bags or something.  Open air.  There's no roof.  Plastic bags.  What's wrong with you guys?  Plastic bags.  Plastic bags.  We're getting lumber from the new houses.  There was always that fucking thing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The development, we called it.  We're going down to the development.  Oh, yeah.  You got some good supplies for the tree fort, though.  Oh, man.  If you're brave enough.  Before they lay the concrete, there's those bizarre fucking trenches you can run around in. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  Fuck, yeah.  Run in all the basements.  Those are the days.  Well, remember when it would rain, there'd be fucking water down there, and they would tell you  a kid drowned.  A kid drowned here last year.  Yeah.  Stay out.  Anything to keep you away.  Last year.  Well, last year to you when you were like five was like forever.  Last year was just a berm.  Davey, before we start today's radio show, we got to get all the stuff we talked about  before the show out there to the people.  Could you tell the Davey Mack story to Ronnie B? 
[00:34:00]  Dave McDonald.  I'm driving back from Germany.  Because Ronnie knows Davey just a little bit.  I'm driving back from my folks' house during that show he does.  Saturday Night Viac.  What is it called?  Sam and Dave.  Well, what night is it?  What does it mean?  It's a Saturday Night Get Together.  It's called Sam and Dave Saturday Night Get Together.  And I put it on, and Dave's telling the story, and he said every year at Easter, his mom  makes him and his brothers and the cousins dress up and do an Easter egg hunt on their lawn.  Do you know about this?  Oh.  So he already knows it. 
[00:34:30]  But the people don't.  Oh.  But the people know.  And they don't know your take on it.  The judges, they didn't know.  Yeah, who knows what happened with them?  Who knows?  They don't know your take on it either.  So Davey Mack's brothers and him, the mom, though, makes them dress in pajamas so she  can squint and make believe they're just toddlers looking for Easter eggs.  But his house is exactly across the street from a church, so people are coming out of,  and there's no wall or fence.  So it's just like church steps, street, and the McDonald's lawn.  So people are like, you know, praising the resurrection of Christ, and they come out 
[00:35:00]  of a building, and there's five fucking grown men in pajamas looking for Easter eggs.  Red-headed weirdos all pasty.  Like it's Cuckoo's Nest.  Dave goes, I'm here.  Like, two things happened this weekend with your fucking channel, where I was the guy that  goes, I almost fucking crashed my car listening to you guys.  And Davey Mack goes, and every year I come in last place with this fucking Easter egg, and  he's getting, like, more and more amped up.  And Sam goes, you're a 33, 35-year-old man. 
[00:35:30]  How can you fucking lose an Easter egg hunt?  It's your house.  You know where all the eggs are.  He goes, my brother did cross country.  And he goes, yeah, but it's a yard, you know, running through the fucking Adirondacks.  You know, it's not like you're going from fucking West Virginia to whatever.  And he goes, he's just quick.  And I, every year I go, fuck, why don't I fucking remember, there's always one under  the grill.  I had to call in and go, what the fuck are you talking about? 
[00:36:00]  And he just retold the story again.  Him and his brother, I said, you should just, oh.  And then he got crazy angry because the priest across the street keeps coming over to their  house and telling them to be quiet.  And he goes, there's no way our fucking shenanigans are going through fucking brick wall.  I go, in all fairness, if I know Davey Mac, he's yelling, cunt, fuck, cunt, fuck, cunt,  fuck.  And like, yeah, during like someone's fucking confirmation hearing.  And he said the priest came over once and told them all to get off the roof. 
[00:36:30]  I wish I heard this.  And I'm like, whose roof?  And he's like, our roof.  He said he's going to call the city and tear us down.  I go, what kind of maniac is living in crudely?  And what, does the moms hide the eggs on the roof?  No, they're just up there like grab ass.  And the priest came across the street and said, get off the roof.  And it's like, it's our roof.  And he's like, he's in on their lawn telling them, get off the roof.  And then I was like, I've been on the phone 18 minutes.  This is like what a crazy person does.  That's a great story.  His house down there, it looks like he grew up in a fucking bed and breakfast too. 
[00:37:00]  I mean, he's like from the hotel New Hampshire.  It's really, really nice.  Yeah.  His family's nice.  So what happened to him?  He was the fucking last one.  He was the last fucking kid.  That's always the case.  When they go, fuck it, just let him go out.  Who cares?  And then he also drowned as a kid.  And I think that fucked them up.  They didn't lock the gate.  And he fell into a fucking, he fell into Spring Lake last year.  Right.  A kid drowned.  A kid drowned.  How long was he drowning for? 
[00:37:30]  Well, he was dead.  I mean, he was technically fucking.  He was a fucking blue baby.  Yeah.  So everything that happened to him was just like a lack of oxygen.  And he's blue to this day.  Yeah, he is.  He's close enough.  He's still blue to this day.  I wish he'd come off the elevator right now.  If he's in the wrong fucking chair in here, he'll get windburned from the air conditioning.  His skin is so sensitive.  And his child's like five.  His daughter's like five years old.  I don't know how old this is.  Yeah, we try to not pay attention. 
[00:38:00]  It's too depressing.  He's a fucking wreck.  And all the tattoos you guys made him get.  Lucky boy.  Yeah, he got a lucky boy tattoo.  And that's what you get in prison if you're a kid motherfucker, right?  No, I just made that up, though.  I just told him that was a thing.  Then later, just to have him get upset.  He's got Sopranos tattoos, too.  We gotta do this again.  Jordan just writes, my brother did cross country is the greatest punchline ever.  Why are you losing?  Well, the rest of the family are like big achievers. 
[00:38:30]  They're like the little Lebowski's.  The little Lebowski's, they're doing great shit, you know.  So he's doing well as a blue baby.  Oh, and his brother went to Dartmouth.  That's what he said, too.  He goes, and my other brother went to Dartmouth.  Like, I don't have a chance at this Easter egg hunt.  And Sam, who I've never heard be that coherent and sharp, I'll give him credit.  The kid was right on it going, that's not an excuse for losing an Easter egg hunt at 33 years old.  And he goes, well, my other brother went to Dartmouth.  And every year I think, fuck, why don't I check under the grill? 
[00:39:00]  That's fucking funny.  And I said, why don't you just write it down now?  Grill.  Bushes.  Like, places it would be in your own home.  Put it on your hand, right?  His mom was like sneak a fiver into some of the plastic eggs, too.  So there's big money out there.  There's a six egg.  I'm sorry, I forgot this part.  There's a six egg limit.  What?  His brothers get all six eggs.  And the mom, the dad, and the whole family just sit there, watch Dave go back and forth  across the yard, because he's only got two. 
[00:39:30]  He's so fucking stupid.  And they're in their 30s.  They just sit there with their six eggs.  Yay!  This would be the greatest reality show ever.  Oh my God.  This would be...  And fucking Dave's like, where the fuck is it?  And then the priest comes across the street and goes, could you please keep it down?  Where's Charlie Sheen going next?  Who gives a fuck?  You think he makes it out of Florida?  Actually, Dave...  We don't think he would make it out of New York. 
[00:40:00]  Every other show is a good one, I guess.  Yeah, he adjusts for some reason.  He's not as bad, he adjusts.  Yes, Rodney, sorry.  He shouldn't...  First of all, let me go back to Charlie Sheen.  He should never adjust.  The fact that he tries to be professional ruins it for me.  He should just come out there fucking crazy.  You know, he should come out with a fucking fire extinguisher and just hit the first row  and fuck you people and go nuts.  Yeah, just go crazy.  Stop trying to act like I need to readjust this act. 
[00:40:30]  Nice shirt.  Thank you.  I forgot we were supposed to wear our Springsteen fucking shirts today, Rodney.  Remember?  I didn't listen.  I didn't listen.  No, uh...  I'm sweating my balls off.  The fucking...  Baby Mac made me sweat.  I was laughing for him.  I was supposed to go.  No, maybe if Justin...  Are you really pissed off you was Charlie Sheen?  I wanted to check it out so I could tell you guys about it.  Someone had to.  You know what?  You could have got a ticket there.  I think it was...  I was waiting for Roland.  I think it was the four guys...  And then I got lazy.  The four guys in this room, if we were at a sold-out Radio City, 6,000 people, right? 
[00:41:00]  Around?  Me, Jimmy, Ronnie, and...  It wasn't sold out, though.  But if the four of us went, we could have turned that whole fucking place around.  With, like, well-timed, like...  This sucks!  We would know when to throw that in.  Boring!  We've heard it enough.  We know when to fucking throw that shit in.  We would have been...  We really could have...  We could have made it hurt.  We could have really turned that whole fucking place around.  Hey, really quick, just in case he's listening.  Justin Stengel from Letterman Show?  Yes.  He was tweeting live on Friday's show. 
[00:41:30]  If he's around, call us.  Oh, did he go?  Yeah, I want to know about...  I really want to know what this Charlie Sheen thing was all about.  It was in our backyard.  So, hopefully he's out there.  You're a big fan of shows.  Completely.  He won an Oscar when he was 20.  He wasn't even trying, Ronnie.  That's right.  Remember Ronnie?  What did he win for?  He didn't.  He wasn't even fucking nominated.  Platoon won.  Why does he keep saying that?  He was very good in Platoon.  He was very good in fucking...  She's a fucking human being, man!  You ain't a one-man firing squad barns, you piece of shit! 
[00:42:00]  That was my rifle across the...  That was an excellent dude.  I actually ducked.  I ducked.  And, uh...  If I find out there was an illegal killing, I will court-martial your ass.  In the meantime, you two will cease fire.  He, to me, was the best part of Platoon.  No way!  Come on!  Zips in the wire!  That guy was the greatest.  Oh, that guy!  I think it was Charlie.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, zips in the wire!  Dump all your remaining firepower within my compound!  For the record, this is my call!  And he hangs up the phone and goes, 
[00:42:30]  Hell of a war!  Phenomenal.  And, uh...  What a fucking great movie.  Oh, it was good.  It was great.  Dear Grandma.  I've been here three days.  I hate it already.  Is that your best Vietnam movie ever?  Platoon?  I really am nutty about Platoon.  And I know Apocalypse Now is...  Uncommon valor.  Hamburger Hill.  Gardens of Stone.  Let's just name them all.  What's yours, Ronnie B?  Um...  You know, I like Apocalypse up to a point.  I don't know why I never... 
[00:43:00]  Like, Goodfellas and Apocalypse,  I never watch the ending scenes.  I just get too fucking depressed.  It does seem like two separate movies.  Yeah, it does.  And Full Metal Jacket, like,  once they go to Nam, you're like,  Wait, what?  I don't need that anymore.  What happened?  Yeah.  How is fucking Vietnam less scary than boot camp?  That's the fucking weird thing about that.  Like, you're, like, more claustrophobic  watching them in boot camp  than when they get to Vietnam.  You're like, this is so relaxing.  Yeah, wide open space, finally.  You get fucking away from that guy.  Oh, God.  I get to shoot something.  I like the Full Metal Jacket, though.  Yeah, the first 45 minutes, I loved.  The second half holds up, though. 
[00:43:30]  It was good, but it wasn't...  Completely different,  as we all have talked about.  The first 45 was such a unique thing, yeah.  It was all the camera work  and the perfection of the shots.  It was just a weird kind of...  Like, two films together.  But without the second half,  you never have Two Life Crew,  me so horny.  That's what fucking...  That locked that down.  You're right.  Knocked it out of the park.  That locked that down.  There was that great, you know...  There was the part where the guy  just kept getting picked up by the sniper  and they had to go out and get him.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  That was pretty...  And they shot that all in England  because he wouldn't leave England. 
[00:44:00]  At his big studios?  Shepard?  Shepard?  Whatever.  He can't leave.  He was one of those guys.  Yeah.  Kate Bush can't leave.  She can't fly or take trains or anything, too.  She just stays there?  Yeah.  Who's Kate Bush?  Some fucking whore.  They won't leave England.  Some girl I met.  Who did we lose over the weekend?  We lost...  Sidney Lumet, ladies and gentlemen.  Lumet, yeah.  New York's greatest director.  Q&A, fucking underrated movie.  Nick Nolte and Q&A.  I love that movie.  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck was he good in that?  They didn't list that one. 
[00:44:30]  Who doesn't?  Don't you come in my hand, you cocksucker.  I'll rip it off.  Timothy Hutton?  Yeah, he was a little overacted.  There's a fucking horrible scene with Armand Asante  where Timothy Hutton's like,  you're going to point your finger at me again.  I'll rip it off and shove it up your ass.  It was terrible.  They didn't list that movie with all the movies he did.  Well, it was Dog Day Afternoon and 12 Agree Mad.  Serpico, right?  Well, Vietnam veterans kind of me.  And Network.  Network.  Network, which is an amazing fucking...  Did he direct that one?  Oh, yeah.  An amazing movie.  Paddy Chayefsky wrote it,  and it may be the best script ever. 
[00:45:00]  I have to agree.  Fucking...  You think Network holds up?  We talk about this all the time.  Absolutely.  And it's proven right.  We're not really sure because now it is what it is.  But back then, he saw this 20, 30 years before it happened.  It's proven right now when you watch it.  You're like, oh, my God, he saw that coming.  But all I'm saying to the people that might be younger  and checking out Network for the first time,  you've got to remember there were three lousy channels,  obviously no smartphones, nothing.  And this guy predicted all this.  No reality TV.  They call it reality shows.  Right.  Yeah.  The news pundits. 
[00:45:30]  That fucking show should have been called 2001  instead of Network.  It should have been 2001 Space Saturday.  Yeah, there you go.  Because it's crazy how fucking real that became.  Mm-hmm.  William Holden is a guy  that had a lot of fucking shit left in him  when he hit his head on the fucking coffee table  with the Shangri-La.  That gave us a couple more.  And he could have fucking lived,  but he was too private to call the fucking ambulance.  Don't you're fascinated, like,  when you're around the addicts and stuff,  like, there's people that shoot heroin  into their ball bags for, like, 15 years.  They smoke crack.  They get hit by cars.  They go to Roosevelt Hospital. 
[00:46:00]  They're fun.  They pull tubes out of their body.  They go home.  They smoke more crack.  And then fucking William Holden  hits his head on a coffee table.  That's it.  Good night.  Yeah.  See you later.  The fragility of life, man.  She was very badly raped, you see?  Tactically, she was.  She being us.  Beautiful.  Of his talent.  Beautiful.  Jimmy, once again,  you've crystallized my thoughts eloquently.  You've done it again.  Yeah, he was just too private.  He could have called the doctor,  they said,  and he just didn't.  Or he could have worn a bike helmet.  Just fucking...  Every time you drank, 
[00:46:30]  put a fucking bike helmet on.  If you're going to be at the house by yourself.  Where...  Yeah, Sidney Lumet was a monster, man.  I'm excited.  See Q&A if you haven't seen it.  You know, I don't know if I've ever seen that.  And if I did,  it was so fucking long ago.  Nick Nolte, it's 1990.  Nick Nolte is so fucking...  A great tranny-loving lieutenant.  He's a scary, scary guy in that movie.  Oh, when he fucking reaches into the fucking...  I love when he grabs...  I thought Jimmy and I were talking about one movie,  two completely different...  I'm like, he's a great villain. 
[00:47:00]  Jimmy goes...  And he jacks off that fucking tranny.  It's right around the corner, too, man.  No, but he squeezes the tranny balls.  What's your name, cocksucker?  Sophia!  Look at that mustache.  He's got a mustache.  He's got one of the better mustaches of all time.  Oh, he's fantastic.  And one bad picture,  and now everyone fucking forgets, you know?  What?  With Nolte,  now everybody in the fucking world,  he gets the one fucking DUI.  Wow, Ronnie, that's just how it works out sometimes.  Who was that supposed to be? 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  I tried to do Nolte.  Off the top of my head.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  See if you got it.  Seriously.  Do Nolte.  I can't do what I'm laughing.  No, do Nolte if he was a Dave's fucking Easter egg hunt.  Well, David.  That's terrible.  It's really good.  It's really fucking good.  Everyone else has it.  Wow, who the fuck do I really sound like?  I'm trying to figure out who that is.  I don't even know if we can put a name on that one.  All right, why don't we break?  It's been a terrific first hour.  Ronnie B is here. 
[00:48:00]  Thanks for the judgment.  Terrific.  Paul Reiser will be here in a little while.  What?  He's coming early?  You want to hear something weird?  Oh, fuck.  Reiser is going to be here any minute,  so we should take a break.  Do you like Paul Reiser jazz, Ronnie?  Are you a Fosse fan?  Yeah.  All that jazz.  Where do you put it?  Are you great?  I like it for, like you said, the dope scenes.  The dope scenes before.  I love it.  Yeah.  It reminds me of when you're a fucking addict and you wake up in the morning, how much shit  you have to do just to feel normal again.  The Ben Vereen scenes was like, he was never a friend to nobody. 
[00:48:30]  That was my nickname.  Oh, Christ, Davey.  Everyone's got their eggs.  You're the only one running around the yard trying to get his.  It's getting better and better.  It's seriously getting so much better.  Thank you.  We're watching it evolve.  Oh, God damn it, Ronnie.  I'm not telling you how to live your life, but look, we got Paul Reiser coming in here.  What the fuck?  Ronnie already talked to Paul Reiser.  Did you watch his show?  Not yet, no.  I chose not to after talking to you on Friday. 
[00:49:00]  No, I loved it.  I didn't want to be tainted.  Who are these people?  So we got Reiser in a few minutes.  He was cool, though.  That was my hope.  It's all right.  It was great.  How long did you do?  Just a quick simbat.  15 minutes?  Yeah.  Quick simbat.  Let's do 15.  Did he go to shade?  Yeah.  We'll do 15 with Paul Reiser.  Why is he coming in so early?  I don't know.  I'm going to guess he's flying around for the press.  No, he probably has to do TV today.  That usually happens.  All right.  We'll break Paul Reiser next.  Jay Moore, anything?  Promoting anything?  You good?  Gotham tomorrow night and Wednesday night. 
[00:49:30]  If you want to fill that up.  All right.  Let's do that.  Bring in the gays now.  I've got half a slice.  Let's get the gays.  Gays Chelsea pizza.  Do you have half slices?  Yes.  I've got to watch my carbs.  Is that soy cheese?  Yeah.  That would be the slug line for the pizza joint.  We have half slices.  Do you have half slices?  Thanks.  I don't know why that's gay.  I mean, but it is.  One of the gayer things I've ever heard is asking for a half slice of pizza somehow is  in, like, in my mind, it just syncs up, like, in total Ronnie B fashion. 
[00:50:00]  Like, that's the gayest thing.  That has to just be gay.  Like, it going, hey, do you want to go in the other room and make out?  It's just as gay as that.  It's right there.  Do you have half slices?  You have to put the hours down like you're really hopeful.  Do you have half slices?  Please, hopefully.  Yeah.  All right.  Stay there.  I'm working on it.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show presents an auditory adventure into the private life  of a famous radio personality starring Anthony Cumia and his Super Snake Shelby GT500. 
[00:50:30]  I'm driving home yesterday, and I'm hearing, like, and usually when I step on the gas, what  you hear is the supercharger more than the exhaust.  So now I can't even hear the supercharger because the exhaust is just, like, real loud.  So I'm like, what the fuck?  So I pull over into a PC Richards parking lot, which is empty because it's, you know, pretty 
[00:51:00]  late on a Sunday, and I peek underneath, and I see one of my exhaust pipes hanging down,  dragging on the ground, and I'm like, you gotta be shitting me.  So here I am with a hanger rigging my goddamn car that costs a lot of money and a lot of  time, and I'm driving it around like a, with a goddamn hanger holding up my exhaust pipe. 
[00:51:30]  I got home and called up Cameron at Shelby and left a voicemail that was laden with curses.  What do you think?  I'm fucking 20 years old in my Nova that I gotta, I gotta, uh, put, use a hanger and  wire up a goddamn, uh, uh, exhaust pipe on, on a car that cost me, uh, a lot of money and  a lot of time, and, and, and I'm driving around like a fucking s**t because I got a, a piece  of goddamn hanger holding up my exhaust. 
[00:52:00]  Here he is in his Mustang, with his exhaust pipe falling down, he's fixing it with a hanger  that costs more than a quarter.  No wire hangers, ever!  It's another case of pure American incompetence.  This has been an auditory adventure into the private life of a famous radio personality.  Brought to you by the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:52:30]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I'm like, what happened to me?  Let's do this.  Should we get, uh, let's get Paul in here.  Yeah, we got Paul Reiser coming into the studio.  Pull it up.  We got Jay Moores in studio.  We got Ronnie B in studio.  Jim Norton.  No, you can sit on this.  Fine.  Anthony, Anthony's still on his cruise.  He'll be back a week from today.  Sit.  Sit.  Paul Reiser is going to sit right over there. 
[00:53:00]  Got a nice round table discussion.  Hi, Mr. Reiser.  Nice to see you.  We met on Friday, uh, very briefly.  You know what?  That wasn't enough for me.  No.  I needed a car.  The column looks terrific.  Say 40 times.  That's all right.  I thought that was funny.  Welcome to the show.  It's early, though, man.  This is early shit.  But, uh, are you doing TV today?  We're trying to figure out your schedule for you.  That is so darn decent of you.  Also, if you could, uh, pre, uh, uh, you know, do my plane ticket.  Yeah.  Pre-board that.  I'm doing, uh, yeah, I'm doing the Today Show. 
[00:53:30]  Okay, that's what I thought.  They're doing Regis.  That's what I thought, because why would you be here this early?  You don't have to.  No, I either.  It's like, I don't know.  I could probably blow off this interview and just do the TV stuff.  What time do you guys start?  Six.  Six.  I would have been here six.  I want to be, I want to get, I want to get when the jokes are fresh.  You know what I mean?  I don't want any jokes that are already been covered.  The first hour of our show is always beautiful.  It's perfect.  It's a perfect hour, and then we make it up after that.  And then we, like, try to do as strong as you can before the people wake up. 
[00:54:00]  Right, right.  And then during drive time.  And then we skate.  Then we skate till 10.  See, that's thinking.  I kind of like that.  Sam, do you have any half slices?  Half slices?  How frustrating is it?  Is it weird promoting a new show?  I mean, you haven't had to promote it in a while.  That's true.  No, it's not frustrating.  No, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of, it is easier to talk about something when people  have seen it, and as opposed to going on to describe.  That's actually, I only became a writer in the first place because I couldn't describe  things.  I go, well, let me, just watch it.  Just watch it, and then you'll see, and you'll see if you like it. 
[00:54:30]  What exactly is the new show?  What?  See, I have to describe it.  I know.  I hate asking like that.  I wish I had seen it, but I've not seen it.  There's a button here that says play, and you'll see it.  It's, it's a, it's a comedy.  It's basically, but never sounds funny.  No matter what I say.  Could I have been doing this for two days?  Yeah, I've yet to make myself laugh.  Yeah, describing comedies is always hideous.  Well, we just want, we just want to get the word out where the people see it.  And it's all, it was, that now, you see, that's all we want to do.  It is, it is a half hour comedy.  It's on NBC Thursday night at 8.30. 
[00:55:00]  It's, somebody said to me, it's a, sort of like your Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I said, all right, it's close enough.  I guess it's sort of curb-ish, in that it's based on me.  I mean, I'm not playing a character.  I'm playing myself, like Larry plays himself.  In fact, Larry David is in the first episode, which was kind of cool.  And I was surprised that he said yes.  Why would you be surprised?  You're a big star.  Yeah, but picture calling Larry David home.  Larry, would you, would you do me a favor and leave your house and do something for me?  No, thank you.  You think you're going to get a yes?  Yes, no, but he was awfully sweet and, might I say, wildly funny. 
[00:55:30]  Sure.  We had about a two-minute scene.  What is Chuckle?  Chuckle's a clown over there.  What did we get?  We lost Jay a while ago, which is distracting, the big Paul Reiser interview.  What are you laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  I'm looking at Anthony's sound effect board, and the little lines he has to remind himself of what button is what.  Like, you would write down, it just says on button 27, I can smell your cunt.  Yeah.  Like, that's a bad gaggle.  Like, I just, well, there's, I can't, like, all, like, Mom 1, Mom 2, Mom 3, Mom 4, like, what the fuck is happening? 
[00:56:00]  I'm not usually here.  There's a person who does this.  Here, Mom 1.  Wait, thank God you're up.  I am not going to lower the head.  So that's Rupert Pumpkin.  That's the, that's the narrow.  Oh, all right, then this would be Rupert.  Mom, please.  Those are classic, you know.  But to look over and see someone's, like, cliff notes of a soundboard, it's like, Mom 1, Mom 2.  See, but now we know why you're laughing, as opposed to you're just out of your mind.  Because we said, if you're getting there by yourself, that seems, it seems crazy. 
[00:56:30]  You guys know each other or no?  We go back, but never this early.  I don't think we've ever seen each other.  We don't need to see me this early.  You get along, right?  Watch what happens.  Yeah, when you see each other.  I didn't even realize you, I looked at the headphones.  I was another guy with headphones.  How you doing, man?  I'm doing well, brother.  Nice to see you.  I'm glad you're up and at him and doing a show.  I find sleep is just for the week.  Sleep when I'm dead, right?  You're a great actor for a stand-up, too.  And I'm a great dentist. 
[00:57:00]  It's fucking hard, man.  Most stand-ups cannot act, myself included.  It's fucking hard.  I'll take the compliment.  Thank you.  You know, on this show, I very specifically played myself so I wouldn't have to act.  Because it's just easier.  No one can say, I don't think you would do that.  I just did it.  And you must be right.  I don't think Paul would say it that way.  But I'm Paul.  But Ryze is a guy, like, every time he's in a movie, he's, like, super in it.  Right, sure.  He never just is, like, wow, who's the comic in the middle of the movie?  Right, right, right.  Yeah, you're awfully nice.  You're awfully nice. 
[00:57:30]  Are you going to eat those eggs?  I'm just saying, if you're not going to eat them, I'll eat those eggs.  He crushed it.  He crushed it.  Mickey Wark was the little hairdresser.  Mickey Moore.  Yeah, wow.  And he's not changed, by the way, in the last 30 years.  That's the beauty about Mickey.  We keep in touch every morning.  He goes, you still want to run lines?  And I go, Mick, the movie's done.  Leave it alone.  That's a long time ago.  Yeah.  It was like this bizarre school of acting that, like, there's all the guys in the time, like,  the whole, it seems like the whole acting drill was just to repeat everything you said,  like, am I going to finish these?  That's what you're asking.  Am I?  Am I going to finish these eggs? 
[00:58:00]  If the script is short, that's good, because then it doubles it up.  So on a 30-minute show, you've got to hold on.  You know, he was, but he was interesting then.  You didn't quite know exactly what he was doing.  He had his own little different rhythm.  He was great.  He was great in that.  Paul, you didn't describe the show, though, did you?  He said it's Morgan Kirk.  I said he started to, and I was laughing like an idiot, looking at it.  So the show, yeah, so we were describing it.  I can smell your cunt.  Oh, there you go.  By the way, he's a family guy.  It's always the whole show. 
[00:58:30]  It does.  Why were you giggling?  Why would you do that?  Why'd you do that, Karen?  That was all the money we had, Karen.  Not with Paul Reiser in the studio.  Why'd you do that, Karen?  Family guy.  Family TV.  My kid, my 10-year-old watches, or he wants to watch, he wants to watch a family guy,  an American dad, but he now, I have the opposite parental guidance.  He will go, I'll walk by and he'll go, Dad, I don't think you should see this. 
[00:59:00]  This has the F word and the S word twice.  I go, okay, good.  I go, wait a minute.  I'm supposed to stop you.  But now he knows, if you see it, Dad, you'll shut it off, so don't see it.  You still doing stand-up?  You know, I haven't been, and I just, like, two weeks ago, after 12 years, I went, you  know, let me see it last week, because I thought I'm going out on the show, let me just flex  the comedy muscle.  And as you know, the comedy muscle can get a little fat, get a little atrophied.  But it was fun.  I was actually really...  Why'd you point to me?  There's three comics in the room.  I'm the only one with a gut. 
[00:59:30]  It's radio.  I just read comedy muscle, because I...  Did you go back to material that you used to have, or did you just start fresh?  I did a lot of Jay's act, and I'll tell you something, it was not working for me.  Does it for him?  Does it for Jack?  No, I was...  No, I wasn't.  I was...  We're all in together.  I was throwing every...  It just started with some new stuff, and just really just standing up and seeing what  it felt like to look at people and talk to them.  Where'd you go on?  I was in L.A., down in Hermosa Beach.  But it's funny, because I hadn't been in the club in years, and I said, well, it's 
[01:00:00]  going to be all new people, and I don't know.  And I walk in, and there's Larry Miller and Gary Shanley.  I went, has anybody left?  This is like, these are the guys over here when I was there years ago.  Why did you stop for so long doing it?  I wasn't...  You know, that's a good question.  Like, why leave that much money on the table?  That's a really good question.  That's why I never stopped.  I was kind of...  I hadn't really thought about it, and I was kind of happy staying home.  And then periodically, I would go out, like, I would emcee a benefit or something, and  I would get laughed and go, well, that's fun. 
[01:00:30]  Why don't I do that?  And then I would just forget.  Were you a stand-up for an actor first?  I was a stand-up.  You were?  I was a stand-up first, and then kind of stumbled into Diner, and that opened that up.  Did you co-create Man About You?  Were you part of the process?  Yeah.  I...  Yes.  Yes.  And you got back-end on Man About You.  In fact, hold on a second.  There's a...  Oh, check's still coming.  There's one.  There's the answer to the why didn't you go to the stand-up question.  Because they were putting money in your mailbox on the regular.  Things worked out nicely, so I didn't have to go out. 
[01:01:00]  I didn't have to go out, but so that was nice.  But it was interesting, because by staying basically home for 10 years, which I wasn't  really.  I mean, I was doing some projects here and there, but basically kind of staying home  and being mostly at home.  The kids kind of accidentally gave me the material for what became the new show, which is the Paul  Reiser show on Thursdays at NBC at 830.  Because it really is about...  I play myself, and I, you know, 10 years later, what are you going to do with your life?  And there's a line in the pilot where I said...  I said this to a friend. 
[01:01:30]  I said, you know, I've been unbelievably blessed.  I mean, I think life has worked out really well.  I've gotten everything I've ever wanted in life.  However, I don't seem to be dead yet, so I didn't time this right.  Right, right.  So now I've got a couple of years left, I should probably do something again.  Well, Seinfeld's a good example of a guy.  After the show, it's almost like, okay, now I'm set financially, but he went on and he  didn't...  What does he want to do?  But I...  And I always loved the purity with Jerry.  He was like, that's...  Even when he started the show, it didn't seem like he was itching to do TV.  He just happened to come up with something brilliant that he did terrifically. 
[01:02:00]  But he always just always wanted to do stand-up, and he's the purist about it, which is why  he's so good at it.  You didn't miss it?  I didn't actively miss it, but as I say, when I would periodically get up and do a couple  of minutes, I would go, oh, yeah, that's coming back to me.  That's kind of fun.  You know, it's interesting, because if I have like a month where I don't do stand-up, it  never crosses my mind.  Really?  Never.  But if I live in Manhattan, I would think about it constantly, because I'd always be like,  who else is at the cellar?  Right.  Is Colin down there?  Right.  Is Jimmy at the cellar?  Then I'll go down to the cellar.  Oh, you know what? 
[01:02:30]  Then I'll put in for spots, and then that way I'll be there where all my friends are.  But if you're in L.A. and you're in like the West, once you get west of O.J.'s house,  you don't fucking leave for any reason whatsoever.  I'm west of O.J.'s.  You know what?  In L.A. I get very, I'm not going to say lazy, because you have shows, but I care less  about doing stand-up out there.  There's just, it's a different life, and it's like, if I had that kind of money coming in  on a regular basis, it's like you're relaxing, you've got a family, why fucking run out?  I probably would do the same thing.  Well, there is something, it's true, I did a couple of sets here at the comic trip this weekend,  and suddenly this memory of, it's got to be 25, maybe 30 years ago, where you'd go 
[01:03:00]  from club to club, and I would do, you know, you try and do four or five sets a night, just  because there's an energy of keeping it moving.  But I also remember that used to be the most confusing thing.  If you did more than two shows a night, the brain would go, you'd be on stage, and you'd  do a bit and go, did I just do that?  Oh, that was the early show.  Yeah.  I forgot to set this up, and the brain would kind of, your knees would buckle.  It was a crazy feeling.  But, yeah, I know what you're talking about.  There's more of an energy when you have clubs right near each other in New York, and you 
[01:03:30]  can just hop around.  It's funny, I did a benefit out in L.A. last week, and Adam Sandler came by, and he was  very nice, and he just introduced me.  And suddenly, you can never take the comedy club out of the comic.  And suddenly, here's Adam Sandler, he can't be bigger, and he came over, and he was just  doing jokes about it.  He goes, you know, Lucian just gave you the light, you've got to get off.  I go, wow, this is a 30-year-old reference.  You know.  What always amazed me about Lucian was he never was not on that comic strip softball team. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Lucian was no longer with us, but he was the manager of the comic strip club.  He looked like Robert Goulet after a stroke.  Jesus.  He had a Robert Goulet.  He was exactly what he looked like.  Yeah.  Good visual.  And he'd wear, like, driving gloves, and he'd pitch.  But you couldn't walk into the club without this guy being exactly there.  Yeah.  Sort of like the Empire State Building.  It was just going to be there when you drove by.  Was he nice?  See, Lucian either loved you or hated you, and he never liked me, which made me go in 
[01:04:30]  and get into every other club in New York to spite him.  I was like, fuck him.  So he helped me a lot more than he ever knew, because when I first came in, he didn't embrace  me.  But he also picked a lot of good guys, like Seinfeld, Gaffigan.  Like, I never would have picked Gaffigan to be great, but Lucian saw it.  Was he good to you when you came in?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was.  I don't remember the exact...  I remember the night that I, quote, passed the audition, and it was three of us.  It was Rich Hall and Carol Leifer and myself, and we were the graduating class of Monday. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  Whatever that was.  That week.  And I think Larry Miller was like six months earlier, and Jerry was a year earlier.  Jeez.  But here we are.  So now I'm going to get off and go, well, why were you talking about 30-year-old stuff  and you didn't plug the show?  Why would you get up at six in the morning and I'll go, oh, that was stupid to me.  You guys are replacing perfect couples on NBC.  And you had a great line, which is being a mid-season replacement is great, because you  sit around and you wait for other shows to fail. 
[01:05:30]  Well, yeah, you're a comedy vulture.  You're just flying around going, wait, there's a dead carcass.  And the irony is, you know, and they're always, the irony is they're always people you know.  It's always somebody you know, and it's somebody's, you don't wish anybody badly.  But in fact, you know, this, I actually wanted mid-season.  Nobody believed that.  And I said, when we were shooting a pilot, I said, how do we get on for mid-season?  And they said, you can't request that.  It's like, I like to be president, but I want to be vice president first, and then I want  the guy to die.  You can't work it out in advance.  And I said, but it's better. 
[01:06:00]  Mid-season is better for me.  Totally.  It takes all the pressure off.  You don't have to go to the upfronts, and they make you go to the bullshit.  Well, it's all.  You've got to fly to Toronto, Paul.  How can you, can't not go to Toronto?  And then you go to Toronto, and it's you and, like, fucking, like, two writers from The Daily  Show, and you're like, this is what I can't live my life for?  Well, but I actually had to sell, I said, listen, I said, pick this up for mid-season,  because they didn't pick it up right away.  And I said, I'll tell you why.  I said, you know, and I know, that these lovely shows that you picked up, many of them will die.  And you don't wish it for anybody, but it's just the sheer numbers. 
[01:06:30]  Especially at NBC.  It's the sheer, well, listen, NBC, you know, you don't get into fifth place by making the  right decisions time after time.  Four networks, and they're in fifth.  Yeah, so that's not easy.  But now that he's starting up, The Office, Will Ferrell, and all these big guest stars,  so Thursday nights, it's going to be really hot again.  It's going to be hot.  See, my whole thing, that was my secret plan.  I want to be the tortoise in the air.  I want to be the tortoise here.  Just kind of sneak in before they know it and go, hey, how did that show get on the  air?  Because, you know, I don't know how any show could ever really survive.  It's the greatest new thing.  Here it is.  Well, it's just, it's comedy. 
[01:07:00]  It's good comedy.  And you don't want to be a big hit on one week.  You want to be there for the long haul.  So to me, this show, we have great comics.  This is Andy Daly.  I don't know if you know Andy Daly.  He's a brilliant comic.  And Omid Jalili, who's a huge comic in the UK.  Yeah.  And his real name is Yafet Kodo.  No, he was in Whoopi's show, right?  He was in Whoopi's show, and he had a movie called The Infidel.  You son of a bitch.  That was for me.  Nice.  You see, somehow you sitting near a little board with your buttons.  It's terrible.  It scares you. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, it's just no good.  You know, it's weird now, too, because whenever Mad About You came out, it's a different game  now because there's so many cable outlets.  Like, your competition now, it's a lot more than it would have been 10 or 12 years ago.  You know, it's an interesting thing.  There's more competition.  There's more things vying for people's attention.  On the other hand, to be a hit, you only need, like, 72 people.  You know what I mean?  You get a million and three people, and go, wow, you're doing great.  It's like, and I don't, you know what, I don't need a hundred million people.  And it's also easier to watch shows now, too. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  You know, DVR and all that crap, so.  Yeah, they're going to watch it.  You would think everybody should be able to watch everything.  Thursday is, like, notorious.  NBC is Thursday, in my mind.  Like, when I was a kid.  No, when you were a kid, I was trying to remember, because when we were sort of grown up, in the 80s and 90s.  Monday was always CBS.  Oh.  What was it?  With, like, New Heart was always on Mondays.  Wow.  I don't remember this.  And then Thursdays was, like, I remember it was, like, The Cosby Show.  Oh, okay.  Growing P...  No.  What's the one with Michael J. Fox?  Family Ties. 
[01:08:30]  Family Ties.  It was, like, The Cosby Show, Family Ties, and then it was Cheers and Night Court.  Like, that was it.  Night Court.  Like, it was...  Cheers was before Cosby Show.  Okay.  Yeah.  Same night.  I think Cheers started Thursday night.  What was the Thursday thing?  Fucking split atoms, aren't they sure?  No, but we don't do facts, or we just fucking...  No, but you know what's worth remembering is those...  Ronnie's right.  Cheers did not get an audience until, like, its third year.  Right.  And then that beget...  The same as Seinfeld, too, right?  MASH.  Yeah.  Seinfeld took a lot.  I've had a little cult following, but that is harder to do. 
[01:09:00]  You don't get three years now, though.  No, and it's almost impossible to do otherwise.  I don't know.  How could any show possibly be a hit?  It's like, why would everybody watch anything in the first week?  Yeah.  You want to hear about it for a while.  So, to me, good news and bad news about television, I think if you put anything on and leave it  there, people will find it, whether it's bad or whether it's good, because you see shows  like, really?  People are watching that?  And other shows that are great, but they're moving around to something, and so all I've  always said is, put it on.  This is going to be a great show.  It's not going to get all 300 million Americans. 
[01:09:30]  There will be some that will say we'd rather watch something else, but there's 10 million,  I promise you, because it's relatable and funny and good.  The thing is, to me, my test was, when I watch this, and I don't watch that much TV, because  I fall asleep.  It's not that it's not good.  I just have two kids, and I'm not awake.  It could be on at 7 in the afternoon.  They're 15 and 10, but I'm exhausted.  It's been going on for 15 years.  What you just said, though, about it takes three years to get an audience, a lot of 
[01:10:00]  people, I guarantee you, have made that argument, like, as they were about to yank their show  off the air, there's no audience for it.  People are like, come on, look, it took Cheers three years.  I don't think it should take three years, but you can see that there are people from  the beginning, and it grows, and to me, I'm really confident that this show is the  kind of thing that would grow.  And what shows do you watch, Paul?  You know what?  My kids sucker me into something, and now I've been catching up on all 12,000 episodes  of The Simpsons, and we watch Modern Romance, Modern Romance, Modern Family. 
[01:10:30]  What's Modern Romance?  Modern Romance would be cooler.  What's that?  Albert Brooks.  Albert Brooks.  If you and your kids said that I'm watching Modern Romance, I would have been like, Paul  Reiser's the fucking coolest guy I've ever had in my life.  No, you know what?  How old are your kids, Jay?  My son is eight years old.  Okay.  So, but do you kind of do all the comedy training?  Like, make them watch things?  No, I try to, but he's not, he's more like a scientist.  He's very dull.  He's like a scientist, kid?  He's like a scientist, like a very logical thinking brain, and like when he tries to 
[01:11:00]  make me laugh, I had, once I had to actually say to him, like, it's really hard to try  to make your dad laugh when your dad's a comedian, but, because I know they're hard to go, you're  the least funny person I've ever met in my life.  Why is that so terrible?  That's so funny.  It's like, he's not listening.  He probably wants to be a funny guy.  Yeah, but it's, what should I do?  He wants to make his dad laugh.  He'd be like his mom, be like, oh, I'm divorced.  Oh my God, you're so funny.  And like, just turn him into a main, turn him into Tracy Reiner.  Tracy Reiner?  I'm not for sure, though.  I don't know who that is. 
[01:11:30]  Take a fucking guess, stupid.  Tracy Reiner?  It's fucking, yeah, it's Chris Rock's daughter, you fucking moron.  Reiner.  Reiner.  Reiner.  Oh, Rob Reiner.  Chris Rock's daughter.  What a douche.  Who's that?  Chris Rock's daughter.  Eric Douglas would have worked better.  But now, does he laugh at stuff?  Does he find things funny?  What does he find funny?  Yeah, you know, he's the kind of, like, I don't know, he's a strange guy. 
[01:12:00]  He's a great odd job.  Like, we go to Hawaii three times.  He still doesn't know, like, it's surrounded by water.  He has no memory.  Yeah, he's a scientist, this kid.  He's a blue baby.  We've got a blue baby.  He's the worst scientist ever.  We went to the zoo and fed baby giraffe.  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  He'll love it.  Take him to the zoo.  I went to the, uh, I knew the zookeeper of the L.A. Zoo, and he invited us to feed the  baby giraffe. 
[01:12:30]  Stop name dropping.  Michael D., the curator, the day after the baby giraffe was born, we went and we bottle  fed the baby giraffe.  And a year went by, and he had homework, and he had to spell the word giraffe on his homework.  And I go, you remember when we went to the zoo, and we fed the giraffes?  And he goes, the zoo?  And I go, yeah.  Didn't ring a bell.  And he goes, oh, yeah, were the toilets flushed by themselves?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I go, yeah, that's where it was.  Yeah, you can't make them like what you want them to like.  He bottle fed a giraffe, but also the trash can had a monkey face on it, and you put the 
[01:13:00]  trash in the monkey's mouth.  Well, listen, but he had a good time.  And he was like, daddy, look, I put trash in the monkey's mouth.  You just fed a fucking giraffe.  Only 10 people in the world get to do that, you idiot.  We fed a Sumatran rhino a head of lettuce, and he's going, the trash can has a monkey  painting on it.  You just described kids, man.  Wow, I need sleep.  That's hilarious.  Oh, man.  I'm feeding the trash can.  Oh, man.  One more thing.  E Street Radio, Paul Reiser? 
[01:13:30]  E Street Radio.  What about it?  Top five Springsteen songs.  You listen to E Street Radio.  I do know I listen to it.  Let's do it.  We got Meyer down last week making lists.  We're supposed to do a top five Springsteen list today.  Oh, good luck.  There was a thing, because I do listen to E Street Radio.  Good luck.  Good luck.  See you later.  That means with the radio show in general.  No, but I was driving around, and I heard Brian Williams was hosting one.  He was hosting?  Yeah.  He got Brian Williams.  Brian Williams did an hour.  He missed the tsunami because he's fucking doing E Street Radio. 
[01:14:00]  Picking out his Springsteen songs.  But he's a South Jersey guy, and he was wildly articulate and passionate.  It's like, whoa.  He's not this passionate about the news.  No, he's not.  No, but he's great.  He was great.  He really is a bore.  He's smooth.  What are your favorite Springsteen songs?  Oh, jeez.  But no, you put me on the spot.  Candy's Room.  Candy's Room.  Good.  My brain just goes so well.  It doesn't matter.  You said Candy's Room.  Independence Day.  I told him to say Candy's Room. 
[01:14:30]  Paul Reiser, 8.30, Thursday night.  I want to hear the five.  I want to hear more about Jay's Kid, because that's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  He's got three out of five.  By the way, the flip side of that is my kids walk around.  They've inherited from me my very bad Jerry Lewis impression.  They've never really seen Jerry Lewis, but they know.  They're just talking this musical thing now, and I go, I drop my book, and I go, what are you doing?  I go, it's Jerry Lewis.  But they don't really know Jerry.  They just know.  It's like me doing James Cagney. 
[01:15:00]  He always looks like he has a lozenge in his mouth.  Oh, the new, oh, yeah, later lozenge.  And he's rewritten history, like he's discovered Dean, he fucking pulled Frank out of obscurity.  He's always like, first show, there was 45 people on the boardwalk.  Second show, there was a line around the block.  I can't do that.  You need a lozenge.  Certainly, actually, you need the lozenge.  He said, first show, there was 30 people.  In between shows, Dean and I wrote down sketches on a cocktail napkin.  Second show, there was a line down the boardwalk to get in. 
[01:15:30]  Like, how the fuck was there a line down the boardwalk to get in?  And word got out from your dressing room where you and Dean were, they needed a singer.  And I said, how about my pal Dean Martin?  Like, no, that's not how it went at all.  He really is a pompous ass, isn't he?  He's a fucking whack job.  He acts like he can, I mean, he was very funny.  He's so like Gene Stapleton.  Who doesn't?  You want to fight, officer?  And you want to get the hell out of my house?  He was just, I think he takes himself very seriously.  He disapproved of the lottery. 
[01:16:00]  Was that Gene Stapleton?  No, that was fucking B. Arthur.  Wow.  You said Walter.  That was an absolute hustle you were doing.  I tried to keep it down for you.  I tried to stay quiet.  I was just thinking about him.  He's struggling.  Gene Stapleton.  Let him struggle.  Sorry.  Let him struggle.  We didn't hear my Nick Nolte impression.  It's great.  Can you do it, Paul?  It sounds like Gene Stapleton.  You want to hear Nick Nolte?  More than anything.  All right.  In fact, I woke up early this morning hoping this would happen.  This is perfect.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  You'll feel like Nick Nolte's in the studio. 
[01:16:30]  I tried to do Nick Nolte and it just came out.  I can't do it.  I go, oh, Christ, we got Paul Ryan.  That's not good.  That's not good.  That could have been better.  I can't do it.  But I meant to say, Jimmy's absolutely Geraldine Page.  Oh, now.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, he's a boar.  You want to fight, officer?  So Geraldine Page is different than Maureen Stapleton.  Very, very good.  And Gene Stapleton.  Gene Stapleton.  Oh, you were Gene Stapleton.  I was a fucking, I just really am just yanking foul balls all over the mezzanine.  All right, now.  I'm sorry. 
[01:17:00]  All right, so the important thing is, this is the most energy I've had at 7 in the morning.  I've never been in a room this funny.  More importantly, Thunder Road.  Thunder Road.  You got two to go.  What do I got?  Top five.  Independence Day Candy's room, Thunder Road.  Thunder Road, a little hacky.  I had time to think.  Oh, what was the one?  Okay, there was one from the post-9-11 album that kills me, Missing You.  That one that kills me.  It's John Waite.  No.  That's a different one.  Why does no one like Youngstown?  I'm not even a Springsteen fan.  I like that one. 
[01:17:30]  Youngstown's a fucking great Springsteen fan.  There's no bad ones.  No, it's just kind of by the numbers to me.  Okay.  So how does he, he writes like 700 songs at a time and he goes, I'll just put the best  15 on the X.  Nah, nah.  You follow him around?  He didn't.  He has hundreds of tapes.  He's never released.  Hey, did you guys hear Pink Cowlick?  So does he have lunch?  When does he have time to have a life?  He's like constantly writing songs.  If you add up all the songs, it would be more than 40 years worth.  But it is ridiculous.  Ronnie knows.  This guy has hundreds and hundreds of hours of stuff he'll never release.  Stuff he's done.  But then you listen to an album like Magic with like two songs on it that are really good 
[01:18:00]  and the rest of it you're like, well, where the fuck are the other songs that didn't  make it?  He's coming.  After he dies, he's going to put it out.  Oh, I'm sure.  Then you'll apologize.  Him and Neil Young.  They're just constant albums.  His kids will get a hold of those archives.  I went to see him at the sports arena in LA and he did Candies.  He did Reason to Believe, Candies Room, and She's the One.  Back to back to back.  And it was like an hour in, I looked at my wife and I said, we can go.  And she goes, don't you want to see the rest of the show?  I go, no.  Fucking Candies Room live?  Like, what is he going to do?  Fucking dancing in the dark to really light me up? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, but did you check with your in-laws every song he's got to do in Philly?  Yeah, I forgot.  It's Fever.  He's got to do the Fever, which he gave away to Southside Johnny, right?  That was his song.  In Philadelphia, he has to do that song every time or the place will fucking riot.  It was Fever.  They'll go crazy.  Let me ask you this, and this is probably too much to ask.  If Bruce Springsteen were on this show, would you ask him his five favorite Paul Reiser jokes?  I would definitely.  But I just want to know that's reciprocal.  I know what they're doing.  He doesn't need to work.  I mean, this guy's doing good.  Most guys just volunteer when they come on. 
[01:19:00]  I talked to Bruce Springsteen, and he told me he loves Paul Reiser.  Men love to put soap in the middle of their chest.  That was Harvey Keitel explaining.  I saw him.  He looked me in my eyes, Paul.  He loves soap in the middle of his chest.  There's no soap under the armpits, is there?  That's Harvey Keitel doing Bruce doing my act.  All right, sounds good.  That's pretty good.  You asked very two people. 
[01:19:30]  That's very eclectic.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Paul doing the best I can here.  Who was that?  That's Nick Nolte.  I know.  Now we know it's Nick Nolte.  Now we know it's him.  In the shower.  Do your, uh, Jay Moore, when you're that.  Honey, get away from the trash can.  We're feeding the giraffe now.  Dad, we're feeding a monkey on the trash can.  If they're going to feed the monkey.  I'm like, you were feeding a fucking six-foot baby.  No one gets to do that. 
[01:20:00]  My son comes out of the bathroom and I go, did you wash your hands?  You go, you got boys.  Boys are really, like, dumb, but you can, like, trick them.  Like, they'll say, can we watch TV?  And you go, we don't have a TV.  And they go, all right.  And they go back upstairs, like, we don't have a TV.  We don't have a TV.  I'll be honest, my kids are not falling for that.  I thought we had a TV.  But I just was watching it, idiot.  He's not like six, you know.  You know what?  I think it needs to end it.  Thursday.  We're going to plug the hell out of this show.  And by the way, ironically, the first episode is all about Jay Moore's kid. 
[01:20:30]  It's good.  It's a perfect segue, yeah.  No, Thursday's at 8.30.  And we're on after community, but leading up to Will Ferrell.  And I tell people, you know, Will Ferrell on The Office, you don't want to miss that at 9 o'clock.  Make sure your TV is working.  Set it at 8.30.  Wait, you're right in between those two shows?  You're right in between them.  Strong spot.  Nice spot.  I had a show, Gary and Mary, they put us on before fucking Criminal Minds.  And I'm like, that's a great place to put a sitcom before an hour of fucking serial killers, you morons.  Really?  But does it, you know, they always have that argument. 
[01:21:00]  And I never quite believe it.  Paul, please.  This is, I'm with you.  I'm with you on this.  Your show's not going anywhere.  It's going to the top, top, top.  He's got Henry Rollins on his show.  Henry Rollins.  Really?  And, by the way, it couldn't have been funnier.  He played himself.  Everybody has to play himself, because I'm playing me.  I'm just saying I'm available.  Larry Davis plays as Larry.  We have the Jay Moore character.  Bring me on as an anti-Semite.  We have Nathan Lane playing you, which is interesting.  We went the other way.  Got it, yeah.  Is this a little like the comeback?  Lisa Cujo show?  The comeback. 
[01:21:30]  Sounds like a little bit.  Yeah, not really.  You know, it's a very sore subject.  You're watching YouTube.  Is it?  Is it?  Yeah, him and Lisa Cujo had that whole thing.  With the whole thing.  Hey, you can't go there.  Can't talk about this.  Don't even call it a comeback.  Thanks, Sam.  Thanks, Sam.  Oh, man.  One guy.  Oh, I heard that.  I can hear that.  I hope everybody's okay.  Well, thank you guys for plugging the show and having me on.  A lot of times I wake up at 6 in the morning.  There was a Lisa Cujo thing. 
[01:22:00]  And a whole Lisa Cujo thing.  Now he's got to go.  No, no, no.  I know.  But now I'm going with it.  I thought the noise was the...  Now I'm going with it, because now he wants to get the fuck out of you.  No, I'm happy.  I thought that was...  I was leaving nicely.  That was the car crash.  John's joke bomb.  So that's the car crash.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't have that part in your brain that says, it's time to go away now.  I just would sit here until they cart me off.  I got nowhere to go, fellas.  The line is, stop talking so much, is my problem.  My brain never says, now's a good time to not say something.  Yeah.  You don't have that.  We don't have that. 
[01:22:30]  We got to get him out of here, because he's doing the Today Show.  I got to go to the Today Show.  And then we're going to watch it on TV.  With Hoda Koeb?  And you're going to watch it.  We're going to watch it.  We're going to be on on TV.  And then we'll turn it up to you.  I'll hold up a little thing.  This is watch, you know, watch, tune in, Opie, and anything.  I'll hold that on to the Today Show.  Everybody listen.  You scratch my back, I'll scratch my own ass.  And I think you owe us one more Springsteen song, I think.  Do I?  Yes.  I think you owe us one more, but we'll let you slide in.  No, no, no.  No, he's got to get five out.  Yeah?  Let me think.  Let me think.  The road's a little hacky, I'll be honest with you.  Well, but, you know, it's still good.  How about Born in the USA?  See, I can't think of a name. 
[01:23:00]  What's the one?  Wait, Johnny.  Johnny, they go on the street and there's a thing.  There's a deal going down.  What's that?  It could be any song.  No.  Johnny, you know.  They go on the street.  Come on.  No.  They go on the street.  I can't think of it.  I sound really dumb now.  No, you don't.  I can't.  No, he sounds smart.  A guy who can't think of the song that he actually likes.  New York Serenade.  Johnny's also on Incident on 57th Street.  Incident, thank you.  Incident on 57th.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, there it is.  I don't know any of those songs.  I don't know Candy's Room.  I don't know any of those.  Oh, my God.  Candy's Room is the song they left off that fucking documentary on HBO. 
[01:23:30]  Rockumentary.  It was a rockumentary on HBO.  It was a rockumentary.  It was a rockumentary.  But they're making the darkness on the edge of town.  I sit there for an hour and 40 minutes.  I'm like, where the fuck is Candy's Room?  Wow.  You take it very seriously.  He does.  He loves them.  It's like, it's the best.  You know what?  A lot of times, have you ever been to the zoo?  What is going on here?  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  It's happening here.  What do you mean?  We're going to play Candy's Room for you.  That's nice.  As we say goodbye to Riser.  Oh, hey, thank you so much for having me.  And I'm going to go talk to Matt Lauer. 
[01:24:00]  So the Paul Riser show, Thursdays at 8.30 on NBC.  Can't miss it.  That's huge.  It's right there.  And by the way, you only have to watch for a couple of weeks.  Then if they pick it up, you're free to watch whatever you want.  But I need your people to watch.  Because it's not like a book.  You know, a book, you can read it whenever you want.  A TV show, we get to see those numbers the first week.  Well, you get DVR numbers, don't you?  Yeah.  But how can that be?  I mean, they say they do.  But really, how do you know when the hell somebody's watching?  How do you get Nielsen numbers?  I don't know how it even works.  I think there's a guy in an office going, I don't like it, do I like it?  Oh, look at this, Candy's Room for you.  Oh, he's the expert, by the way. 
[01:24:30]  Did he get it right with Johnny?  You know Louis De Palma, right?  He got it right?  He had very good picks.  And Thunder Road's on Hockey.  Thank you.  Thunder Road would be on my list.  It's a classic.  It certainly wasn't the most eclectic on the group.  But how do you go there and not say that?  I'd go there.  All right.  I'm going to go talk to people.  Let's get them out of here.  All right, thank you so much.  Great to see you, man.  Candy's Room to break, why not?  And more with Ronnie B and Jay Moore and Jim Norton.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you, man. 
[01:25:00]  In Candy's Room, there are pictures of heroes on the wall.  We get to Candy's Room.  We had a walk in the darkness of Candy's Hall.  Strangers from the city.  Call my baby's number.  They may bring the toys.  When I come back to me, she smiles pretty.  She knows I might be Candy's boy.  There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face.  A sadness all her own. 
[01:25:30]  From which no man can keep Candy safe.  She said, baby, if you want to be wild, you've got a lot to learn.  Close your eyes, let them melt, let them fire. 
[01:26:00]  Let them burn just in the darkness.  We'll be in the world to shine.  And when I can't be close, she makes us in the world.  Oh, love.  Oh, love.  Oh, love. 
[01:26:30]  Look, I want to see you in the world.  Come on.  Oh, love.  Oh, love.  Oh, love.  She has fancy clothes  And diamond rings  She has men who can wear  Anything she wants 
[01:27:00]  But they don't see  She has fancy clothes  And they don't see  I can wear a mask  But they don't see  She has fancy clothes  If you can wear a mask  But they don't see  But they don't see  But they don't see  If they don't see  Sirius XM, the virus. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, this is the O.P.  D'Anthony Show.  Damn it.  All right, we're back.  We've been laughing for ten straight minutes ever since Paul Reiser left his studio.  We don't even know.  Paul Reiser left.  Things picked up. 
[01:28:00]  I guess we're going to give the stick to Ronnie B.  Because he has a lot of observations.  Real quick, somebody just wrote on Twitter,  Jay and Ronnie are getting hernias from carrying Paul Reiser around the studio.  This is the thing, O.P., and I'm telling you the truth.  I couldn't live with this kind of uncomfortability that you seem to be okay with.  I love it.  I love it.  That's like a fucking sunlight to plant.  I love that.  Or a plant to sunlight.  It's an area most people don't feel comfortable in.  I didn't think it was that.  I didn't think it was that uncomfortable. 
[01:28:30]  No, no, no, no.  It wasn't uncomfortable.  Hold on.  It got really weird in here.  All you'd have to do is read Paul's face when it's got here,  and Jay's fucking over there giggling,  and then making up a fucking lie of,  No, I was looking at something else.  What am I supposed to say?  I use a Ron Bennington line.  What happened?  He came in, and he sat down,  and he just started going,  Oh, it's good to be here. 
[01:29:00]  And I go,  I just said to him,  Do you have half slices?  And it made me hysterical.  So I realized it would be rude to just laugh in his face,  because there's no way he's going to know what the fuck I'm talking about.  So I turned my head,  thinking that he won't be able to see me,  like a fucking angelfish when you look at it straight on.  And then Sam is holding the camera,  and I see Sam holding the camera,  and he's sobbing uncontrollably,  laughing at,  Do you have half slices?  And then I'm laughing,  because he's laughing. 
[01:29:30]  It was literally like,  The mushrooms have just kicked in.  I can't,  without the hallucination,  I couldn't stop laughing.  And then he goes,  Well, what's going on with Mr. Giggles over here?  I know.  And then his fucking syllaboness is like,  He's Jodie Foster.  Yeah, sure.  Chicky maymay.  Chicky maymay.  And then recognized you finally.  And then that really made it uncomfortable for me,  because it felt like,  it was like,  you know,  Jay's trying to fuck up my spot.  I've been away for 12 years. 
[01:30:00]  He wanted a legit interview from us.  Yeah, he did.  And you didn't watch his show.  You didn't...  I didn't watch,  because I ran into Ronnie on Friday,  and he basically told me,  No, no, no.  it would be a better interview if I didn't watch this show.  I thought that maybe you'd be more optimistic.  Okay, that's all I said.  I honestly couldn't find my disc,  and they gave me a copy of it,  and I had the Gervais one,  but I didn't have that one.  I'm sure it'll find its audience.  And then Ronnie got up and just started...  I can't fucking be around.  I don't want to feel like I'm in school.  What was happening that you couldn't be... 
[01:30:30]  It was like the fucking church laugh started going.  But I had long stopped laughing at that point.  But Ronnie...  I was asking him questions.  He was talking about going to the Ice House,  or Pasadena,  or Hermosa Beach,  and then Ronnie...  Don't fucking...  Don't put it on me.  You got up,  because you thought he was a fucking snorer.  No, I didn't.  I thought he was really good.  And you got up,  you came over to me,  picked up the fucking newspaper,  and read it like fucking Fred Sanford.  He's like fucking shaking it out,  like the fucking Boston Herald on the tee,  like,  Oh, no, son. 
[01:31:00]  I fucking socks lost again.  I thought he was going to walk out of the studio,  though,  with his...  He walks over here,  the worst place to walk.  As if to say,  I can't take this shit anymore.  I couldn't.  It was very fucking painful for me.  You were getting very uncomfortable?  Yeah.  What was...  What was...  The fucking strangest...  Now,  here's the weird thing.  All right.  And I don't know whether you feel good about Jimmy,  but...  Did you do Q&A?  Turn that to...  What happened there to...  Now,  this is why I feel bad about myself,  though.  All right.  I feel fucking bad about myself,  because you said,  about what he's been doing for 10 years. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he's been taken care of, right?  Yes.  And the situation that he has at home,  and then I didn't realize that...  With your kid,  I was yelling,  take him to the zoo, Rock.  Take him to the zoo.  Fucking...  Then Jimmy tells me that's his real situation.  It was his real situation.  Can we turn the mic off for a second?  You don't know this?  Just one fucking second.  Well,  we need to on hold music.  You don't know this?  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do you have a quick...  You know what's happening?  Well,  I know what they're talking about. 
[01:32:00]  I mean,  but I didn't...  I only said it  because I was saying  that's probably why he hasn't  worked as much in 10 years.  He's probably been very...  You know,  he's got stuff at home  he's got to do.  He's probably been just preoccupied.  He's got a kid.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got one of those kids.  Oh, my God.  Right.  Yeah, but nobody said anything about him.  No, I said  I was doing about your kid.  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  You know,  we times love the zoo.  That's the fucking thing.  So then after Jimmy tells me that,  I feel fucking terrible.  Like,  when did Jimmy tell you that?  We don't need it anymore. 
[01:32:30]  Jimmy wrote a little note.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, he passed me a note.  No, we were just talking  during the break  and I was just saying  that's probably why he hasn't...  I didn't know that.  And then I'm doing about your kid.  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  I fucking like that.  I have a special aunt  so I wouldn't even, like...  It didn't even dawn on...  Like, I didn't say anything  other than that my kid's a bore.  But in hindsight,  he's probably going,  yeah, I wish my kid  was a bore.  What?  Count your blessings, Jay.  Count your fucking blessings.  I'm going on and on  and I don't want to get  so fucking bored. 
[01:33:00]  And he's not funny at all.  My kid's really a boring guy.  And he's singing.  He's up again.  Ronnie's up again.  He's walking.  And he's pacing.  He's pacing.  He's pacing.  I can't be wrong.  And he's pacing.  And he's over there going,  yeah, I wish my kid  was as boring as yours.  Oh.  Gotcha.  And that's what made Ronnie  I finally now...  Alright, and then  as soon as the interview ends,  Jimmy turns to me  with, like, fucking...  It really was like  being on mushrooms.  Like, I was tripping balls  for a second 
[01:33:30]  for 40 minutes.  Jimmy just leans in  with huge eyes  and there's a fucking  Q&A quote in my face.  Like, the last 40 minutes  never happened.  Like, we were just doing  Q&A, Q&A, Q&A.  He just leans in and goes,  you talk to me nice  for a straight beard.  But he did it like...  No, the line was...  It was when  fucking Nick Nolte  is sitting there  and he's talking  to the fucking  one tranny  about the fucking  line of trannies  dancing.  And he goes,  that one on the end  has, what, nice legs?  And she's like,  his name's Michael,  like yours. 
[01:34:00]  That was the fucking line.  But you're like,  Paul Rice is leaving  and he goes,  alright, we got  Candy's Room right here  for our outro music.  And, like, literally  an hour had gone by  and I hear,  to get to Candy's Room,  you gotta walk  to darkness.  And then all of a sudden  Jimmy just leans.  It was like being on acid.  Like, his eyes got big  and he got real close  to my face.  He goes,  that one's got nice legs.  And I'm like,  oh my God,  I'm tripping.  What the fuck  is in my coffee?  Take him to the zoo,  take him to the zoo, Roddy.  Take him to the zoo, Roddy. 
[01:34:30]  I couldn't live this well.  I've never seen  Roddy out of control.  Because I figured  he would get up  and just leave.  But he walked  to the weirdest  area of the room  because he didn't  know what to do.  He's a fucking  one in the zoo.  I couldn't be around.  They couldn't get a cage.  The people out there  gotta understand  the studio.  For him to walk  between me and you  is the strangest.  It's an L-shaped kitchen.  I went over and gave  fucking Sam a shelf too.  I wanted to really  make it weird.  And then they just  pushed Sam  and tried to film the mess.  If you picture  an L-shaped kitchen, 
[01:35:00]  Ronnie left the fucking sink  and was like,  I gotta get over  by the stove.  Yeah.  I think Paul had  a good time.  Yeah, that's why  he tried to leave  six fucking times  wrapping it up.  And you were going  just one more thing.  Well, it didn't help.  Give me another song.  It didn't help  with the cunt thing though.  That was fucking  uncomfortable.  He's a family.  It's uncomfortable.  He's family TV, Jay.  How do you not do comedy  for 12 years?  I don't know  if the language bothered him.  He fucking pointed to me  and goes,  you know,  your comedy muscle  gets flabby.  I'm like,  I just did a fucking 
[01:35:30]  show last night.  Don't fucking look at me.  Don't point at Jay.  And I'm the one  fucking with the gut  all the time.  Oh my God.  I don't think  he meant you though.  You don't think  overall.  I don't think  he knows I'm a comic  to be honest with you.  I think he referenced  you as the stand-up.  And that's what  insulted me most.  My God damn it.  I have a fucking  I have a really  So did he have a good time  you think?  No.  No, absolutely not.  I disagree.  I think he was fine.  I bet he comes up  on the fucking  Today Show later. 
[01:36:00]  What a nightmare  day he's had.  I bet he's telling  Kelly Ripa about it later.  Fuck.  And then he walked  down the hall weird.  I bet he was fine.  Yeah, he walks  like a cowboy.  He walks like  a fucking  old school cowboy  too.  It's like  like a fucking  silent movie cowboy.  Women like guys  with bow legs  because there's  the illusion  that they have  big cocks.  And that's why  they walk that way.  No, but that's true.  Women like guys  like that.  We complimented  the shit out of the guy.  We brought up  his movie career.  Dude, it was fun.  One movie.  His first movie 
[01:36:30]  he made when he was 19.  I was going to get  to Alien,  but I couldn't  stop laughing.  It was fine.  Take him to the zoo rock.  Take him to the zoo rock.  It was fine, Ronnie.  Take him to the zoo.  That is the show.  You just kind of  come in and hang  and fucking do it.  You go home  and get your fucking  shy box.  You misread that.  That's a normal  interview for us.  Yeah, I know.  For you guys,  I'm sure it is.  I know.  I know what it is.  I'm sorry you do  it differently than us.  Ronnie's the pro's pro.  I'm listening to him  interview Dennis Quaid  last night.  I'm in the car  driving back  and I'm like, 
[01:37:00]  I listen to the  whole thing  and, well,  I'm not going to  blow your spot up,  but I'm like,  wow,  that was incredible  and then it turns out  it was a little more  work for Ronnie  than it came across.  I'm not going to  take the bat out of your hand.  I just don't think  that a lot of actors  give a fuck.  I don't think  they're all that connected.  Oh,  can I just say  something real quick?  Ronnie comes over to me  and goes,  where'd you get  the fucking  E Street radio thing? 
[01:37:30]  And I go,  there's a one sheet  of like six things  to talk to.  Paul was in Beverly Hills  cop one and two.  I'm mad about you.  He made a million dollars  a week.  And then like the fifth one  is Paul said on Twitter,  he sits in his car  just listening to  E Street radio  and Paul goes,  nice something to  fucking not take a spoon.  What would you say?  Like,  I brought up  E Street radio  and he looked at me  like,  of all,  like,  what the fuck  are you talking to me  about E Street radio?  He was getting pissed.  Like,  if Springsteen came in here,  would you be asking about me?  Oh,  that was,  I thought that was a joke. 
[01:38:00]  No,  he was like,  fucking uncomfortable.  He's trying to plug  his fucking show.  Oh,  I didn't know that.  Here's the thing though,  he doesn't seem like  he knows any  Springsteen songs.  It seemed like  his funny broke.  Like,  he didn't even understand,  like,  I had to go,  I'm doing Keitel,  like how I,  explain to my son  why you can't talk  to people that way.  He's like,  I'll take him  to the Subaru.  Laugh on camera.  Laugh on the mic,  you asshole.  Every time I make  Roddy laugh,  he pushes the fucking  mic away.  I don't want any part of it.  Laughter's fucking  uncomfortable to me. 
[01:38:30]  I'm dying over here.  Laughter's not a  comfortable feeling for me.  You know what it is?  Like some smothering.  He hasn't done a lot  of these interviews  in a while,  so it's kind of,  he's getting back into it,  and he didn't know  if he was being laughed at.  That's when he walked in,  I think he was a little  uncomfortable.  He didn't look at us  when he walked in.  Because I do these  every week on the road,  but I think for him,  he hasn't done a whole  shitload of this kind  of radio in a while,  so for him,  it was just feeling it out,  and he was a little  uncomfortable.  He was confused.  A little uncomfortable,  yeah.  He went from the door  to his chair  looking at his fucking shoes.  Yeah, he was confused. 
[01:39:00]  Which to me is very odd,  because any time  you're on the road,  you walk in,  you go,  hey guys!  Sure, sure, sure.  Like, hey,  let's start off  on a good foot.  I'll just say,  hey, how you doing?  But he had one of the  hottest shows on television,  and now he's kind of,  this is not starting over,  his show is on the air,  but he's out  on doing morning radio,  plugging the gig,  it's been fucking,  how many years  since he's had to plug it?  It's probably been  15, 17 years  since he's had to  go out and plug.  Jay was being  fucking disrespectful.  He was fucking  over-giggling  in the fucking corner.  That's how it started.  And doing fucking  callback jokes 
[01:39:30]  that the guy  wasn't here for.  We never even got past  What are you fucking  time, sweetheart?  Jay, we never got past  the half-slicing.  I fucking,  You set the fucking tone.  All I said was,  do you have slices?  What does that mean?  Do you have half-slices?  That's why,  I just was like,  what am I going to,  let me just get  the interview started.  So right away  he didn't feel like,  oh, I'm the fucking,  I honestly didn't think  he saw me laughing  because I had my head  turned,  like that's how crazy,  like I was crazy.  And you were ducking down 
[01:40:00]  behind screens.  Any listener,  you have a lot of  fucking drug-taking listeners.  It was exactly like  a half hour,  40 minutes into Mushrooms  where nothing's hallucinating,  but you just start  laughing fucking balls  and you can't stop,  like you can't breathe,  like this is bad,  I'm going to have to go  to fucking St. Luke's Hospital  because I'm laughing.  He just didn't know  if he was the butt  of the Joker thing.  He was right though.  He was right to feel that.  But no,  but if you were to explain  to him that it was  the slices thing,  it was,  that would have made sense.  He didn't even hear  what I said. 
[01:40:30]  No, I don't know.  And here's the other thing,  if you're a fucking comic,  I don't give a fuck  if 30 years go by,  if fucking Hackett  sat in that chair,  not now obviously.  Yeah.  I'll fucking go crazy.  If fucking Hackett  sat in that chair  and we were all  breaking balls,  he would fucking  just fucking swing  for the Raptors  and play.  As a comic,  you gotta read the room.  No, but he didn't say  anything shitty though.  He should have been  able to read the room.  It was a different radio show  where these guys like to...  with me, I think,  and what you're saying is...  I think you should be able to.  If you're a fucking comic,  fucking jab,  throw the hook, 
[01:41:00]  fucking,  it's a room full  of fucking guys.  Play.  Yeah.  Fucking play.  We'll get the plugs in.  I asked Allison Janney,  I did a guest spot  on the West Wing once  and I said,  this is my favorite show,  why did Rob Lowe,  she's got a nice,  what's her name?  Michael,  just like yours.  That one on the end  has such nice legs.  I said,  why is Michael  like yours?  You're a fucking jerk.  He said,  I said,  why did Rob Lowe,  did he get fired?  She goes,  no, he quit.  And I go,  why?  She goes,  he just didn't 
[01:41:30]  want to play anymore.  And I thought,  like,  that's acting.  You fucking go to work  and you play  when you do your job.  If you're a fucking comic  promoting a fucking show  and you're in a room,  you know it's a fuck,  it's Opie and Anthony  on satellite.  It's not like his people,  this guy's got checks  coming in  for fucking $4 million  because they're playing  fucking Mad About You  to sue the fucking  tsunami people  at Red Cross Station.  He's getting paid  hand over fist.  He should,  I just,  if you're a comic,  you should just  fucking swing through it.  If you own a hat store, 
[01:42:00]  you put all the hats on.  Guy who gives horrible examples.  I just shook his hand  on the radio  just to make him feel better.  More importantly,  how's the Nick Nolte?  Oh,  he's got a boat.  He calls his boat  the Nancy.  I could vomit.  I'll cry.  Nobody wants to name  their goddamn boat  Nancy Jimmy.  It's getting better.  You've got to do it.  It's like Jimmy Stewart Nolte.  You've got to do it.  You've got Nick Nolte  in front of him.  And when Ronnie says it,  you've got to do it. 
[01:42:30]  Ronnie can talk me  into Robin and Ben.  Well,  you're,  uh...  Yeah,  but Ronnie can't sit  for an uncomfortable interview.  No,  I don't want to fucking  turn into a different guy  and start fucking laughing hard.  That's all.  I don't like  the fucking laughing hard thing.  But you're getting me  out of my comfort zone.  Let's get you out  of your comfort zone.  What part would you  have laughed hard at?  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Just the fucking weirdness  of feeling like  I was in school again  when you're over there  acting like you don't  want anybody to know  that you're laughing  and yet it's the loudest  fucking thing.  Oh,  you can hear it? 
[01:43:00]  Yes!  Why would we...  You were laughing  into a microphone.  How would we not hear that?  Jimmy's trying to be  a professional  and ask him questions.  And he's just staring at you.  Jimmy asked him,  where have you been?  No,  I didn't.  I said that  you're still doing stand-up.  I was actually curious  if he still did stand-up.  And I wanted to say,  where have you been questioned?  When it got uncomfortable  for me  was when he said  he went and did stand-up  and it wasn't that good  and I was like,  wow.  Like, how...  I would love to have heard,  yeah.  What's it like  to do stand-up for 10 years 
[01:43:30]  and then go up there  and go,  fuck, man,  this is hard.  How the fuck  can you not do stand-up  for 10 years  if you're a fucking stand-up?  Look at the game, Dave!  He was voted  one of the top 100 comics, too.  I mean,  Ryzen was a legit comic.  He wasn't like some guy  that just had a show.  But my point is,  apparently not.  You're born a comic.  You don't leave  that money on the table.  That's what I always say.  I say I don't do it  because I want to.  I do it because I have to.  Every interview.  We're talking about comics, Sam.  But isn't there...  There's a girl, Abigail. 
[01:44:00]  But, Jake,  can't you be a stand-up  without being a funny guy?  Think about that.  There are writers  who are stand-ups  that aren't particularly  funny guys, yes.  Put together  a good stand-up set,  but is he a funny guy  when he's just hanging?  Louie Anderson  is a funny guy.  And his stand-up  is like the most  vanilla,  milquetoast stand-up  in the world.  But if you sat  in a fucking car  with Louie  and just drove...  You'd be howling.  He's just a fucking  funny guy.  And he used to say, 
[01:44:30]  how the fuck  are you going to be great  if you get a funny greatest?  Stop.  I'm sorry.  See, that's a thing.  You can't stay on track.  There for a second.  Someone put fucking  drugs in my coffee.  He used to say to me,  they can never  take that from you.  They can never...  If you're at a fucking...  If there's a lightning storm...  They can never  take it from you, Jeff.  They can't take that from me.  You're funny.  The kind of...  And if you are a comic,  I don't give a fuck  if you wake up  and leave the hospital  and they stick a mic  in your face. 
[01:45:00]  It's just your fucking DNA.  Jimmy's never not funny.  Thank you.  It's true.  It's nice that you say that  to him, seriously.  Like, Ronnie's a fucking...  Like, the root of fucking  Ron Bennington  is a fucking comic.  But here's the thing.  You could have made him  feel welcome.  You could have made him  feel welcome.  You chose not to drink.  Yeah, you chose not  to vacuum.  That was a choice you made.  You know why?  It's not my fucking show.  We always start by  making him feel comfortable.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Always.  Big welcome aboard.  It always starts there.  We don't know where 
[01:45:30]  it's going to lead after that,  but yeah.  Your half-sliced thing  really derailed  the whole fucking thing.  I had no idea.  It wasn't on his prep sheet.  I had no idea.  I thought I was laughing  off mic.  Oh, my God.  No.  I did.  No.  It had the first day  of school when you're  smoking joint before you go in,  and then you and your friend  aren't sitting together,  but you're still laughing about it.  I was way past joint.  I was full fucking shroomed up.  How was the riser interview?  Did he have a good time?  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah, it was a good interview.  What did he say? 
[01:46:00]  I like Springsteen.  Thank you for having me in.  Where are the Charlie Sheen tickets?  What?  Yeah, you heard me.  You seem fine today.  That's true.  That sleep might have  helped him a lot.  I know.  He went to sleep at noon.  He's a fucking big bear.  No, here's the other thing.  Last weekend I was with you,  Jimmy was sick.  Yeah.  Still came in.  Still had things done.  That's right.  Didn't take a 14 fucking hour nap.  That's right.  We could have done a fucking  Rip Van Roland, LOL.  I'm very suspicious 
[01:46:30]  of this NyQuil sick thing.  That is true.  I really did fucking man up.  You did.  When have I ever  let you guys down?  But you sound fine today.  Well, yeah.  Can I take a NyQuil?  That's the fucking day.  Yeah, nothing matters.  Roland is like a cat.  When Roland feels like  he's in a corner,  he is like a cat.  That was a perfect answer.  When was the last time  I let you down for tickets?  Yesterday.  It's not even  officially yesterday.  What else is there  to talk about though?  Other than the thing  of like I didn't do  bad things before. 
[01:47:00]  You did this time.  You did.  It's the last thing  I care about.  You never even called.  I was asleep.  I would have called.  You didn't sleep  from noon until now.  I did.  Charlie Sheen  was at Radio City  Friday night.  That is true.  So you could have  gotten the tickets  Friday for Sunday's show.  Because he said  you were going to Philly.  Oh, he did say that.  I came back.  You did.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I went to Philly Thursday.  No, you did Thursday.  Oh, wait.  Now you're messing with me.  I thought you went  to Philly Friday.  No.  What do you got?  I'm on a pain  on my list, kid?  Well, girlfriend,  I don't have a schedule. 
[01:47:30]  Take him off that  fucking list.  Take him off that list.  Wait a minute.  Where the fuck  am I, Charlie Sheen?  Didn't you text me  that you were walking  over to my place  Saturday to give me  something?  Yeah.  Well, when all I  asked you for  was Charlie Sheen tickets  and my old man's  going to fucking  take me to Radio City  is the fucking  Charlie Sheen.  And you're going  to tell me  you're going  to decide  out of the fucking  blue to take  NyQuil and sleep it off?  Why don't you tell us  what really happened?  That's a great  Nick Nolte. 
[01:48:00]  Seriously, he's getting  so much better.  Amazing.  He's just getting  a little fucking madder.  There you go.  He's nailing it.  Best exchange ever.  Roland, why don't you  tell me the truth?  There's Billy Bats  in that bar.  Ronnie needs the truth  today.  Wonderful.  Ronnie, get the truth  out of him.  I don't understand.  He's living a double life.  That's all.  And whatever it is,  it's okay.  You're accepted here.  I was in my underwear  at the night.  Roland, tell me the truth.  Now we got underwear.  You couldn't get the tickets.  Now it's getting hot.  No, I can get the tickets.  If you couldn't get the tickets,  you couldn't get the tickets.  It's not a big deal. 
[01:48:30]  Just say what it was.  He hisses when he feels  like he's in the corner.  It's like a bad cat.  Yeah.  What it was?  I told you,  but you weren't listening.  When he feels like  he's cornered  and he doesn't have  a real answer to anything,  he'll hiss at you.  I didn't know  where the sound  was coming from.  When that was Roland,  let me see you do it again.  You are a fucking strange guy.  Yeah.  And no one,  you know,  like you meet someone  from radio and you go,  I never would have thought  he'd look like that.  Roland is like  fucking A number one. 
[01:49:00]  Like,  how the fuck does that sound  come out of that machine?  Oh, really?  He's got a high,  like effeminate,  like fucking gay,  like he works the floor  at fucking Macy's voice.  He'll go fucking crazy.  Don't fuck with him.  He will not,  he doesn't fucking play games.  Roland doesn't fucking play games.  Don't touch his face.  We're not even joking  on this one.  Don't touch his ears.  We're not even joking.  Roland is the real fucking deal.  Roland,  are you like a fucking crazy man?  Oh,  yeah.  And if I,  he's not like a midget. 
[01:49:30]  Why don't we play the pole clip?  You want to turn this into a win-win?  You want to fucking push back some things  and wrestle like your old high school days?  I wrestled Anthony.  It's on YouTube.  I fucking headlocked the shit out of him.  Almost broke his neck.  I'm out of the business.  Why didn't you get in,  why didn't you get in win-win?  That would have been perfect for you.  Playing a fucking wrestling coach.  What's that?  The fucking,  yeah.  I don't know.  Nobody asked me.  Oh,  yeah,  you would have been perfect.  You would have been perfect for that.  That's like when people come up to you and go,  hey,  how come you don't make like a,  you know,  you'd be really good in like a Vietnam movie.  But this is fucking North, 
[01:50:00]  it's a Jersey town wrestling coach.  No one asked me.  What do you want me to hire myself?  Yes.  I think you suck.  I think Jay's a fucking terrific actor.  Jay is a terrific actor.  Terrific fucking actor.  I think I'm starting to become pretty good,  but not.  No,  you're very good.  I've watched you.  Most comics are very,  really are great actors.  When I see myself,  I see how hard I'm working at trying to do the thing.  And like starting with seeing other people,  I see myself not working. 
[01:50:30]  Who's,  uh,  who's comfortable to you?  Who,  when you watch,  you're like,  I'd like to be in that feeling of comfortability.  Mark Ruffalo.  Really?  Who's that?  Fucking talks.  He's who is he?  I know the name.  He just got nominated for,  uh,  I saw that movie.  Kids are all right.  You like the kids.  All right.  I love it.  I like the kids.  All right.  Did you see the kids?  All right,  Ronnie?  Yeah,  I didn't like it.  I was really fucking disappointed.  You're kidding.  Yeah,  I thought,  uh,  here's what I hated.  The fact that the two lesbian chicks couldn't have like an alternative family that had still 
[01:51:00]  had to come back to,  uh,  all right,  what she really needs is dick.  She can't fucking turn down cock.  Like,  you know what I mean?  And I'm like,  fuck,  let them be different.  Why does everything have to fucking return to just being like everything?  Just like,  uh,  in up in the air where he caves at the end and you really found out,  Oh,  I'd rather be a nice guy at home.  Right,  right.  You know,  it's just like,  we still have to fall back to if you're fucking different,  you're unhappy.  You can't give the people the fucking chance to be themselves. 
[01:51:30]  That movie stunk up in the air.  Yeah,  it was fucking terrible.  And it fucking was,  I like the idea of the fucking guy is just like,  um,  I'm not fucking like everyone else.  I'm just going to fucking go around with nothing.  That's a fucking interesting thing.  Hit a lot of miles,  man.  It's true.  It's real true.  Him packing a suitcase was the most fascinating,  like that kid,  uh,  is that Reitman's son?  Yeah,  it is.  Yeah,  it was.  He did a fantastic fucking job filming the, 
[01:52:00]  I'm being serious.  Yeah.  The packing of the suitcase,  the putting your entire life in that little fucking bag was fascinating.  Yeah,  I thought like that philosophy.  I'm like,  okay,  I'm in.  And then a half hour later,  I'm going,  Anna Kendrick.  I hate it when they took all their clothes off and they showed the funny scene of the  two of them like disrobing and like doing their business.  The two,  the guy and the girl,  that was fucking painful.  Oh,  I gave a shit.  It was almost a good movie though.  Uh,  it would have been if it wasn't for the cast and story. 
[01:52:30]  The concept was good.  Yeah,  I did.  I liked the thing.  The concept was good.  Some people are different.  Some people don't fucking live like everybody else.  Right.  Why do you have to make sure at the end,  Oh,  it is better.  It relates to that guy.  Just like Ruffalo.  Yeah.  Why were they so fucking mad at him?  He's trying to get into the family.  Let the fucking guy come around.  He gave you sperm.  He gave you life.  Now he'd like to fucking come over for mashed potatoes with the dykes.  Let him come in.  Why does everybody have to act like,  Oh no.  Even though we're lesbians,  we're still like a mom and a dad. 
[01:53:00]  Just like you people at home.  Don't fucking change.  It's like,  everybody has to fucking fall back into that.  If you,  if you do something that they deem as a sin,  you're fucked.  Your nose is dripping.  I don't fucking,  God damn it.  I wish I would have said this fucking 15 minutes ago.  We're breaking Ronnie P today,  I think.  It's too early.  It's too fucking early.  I knew that's how you picked up the neck.  I was staring at Ronnie's nose.  Nose is trippy.  I was staring at Ronnie's nose,  and Jimmy picked up the neck.  Old shiny nose McGillicuddy. 
[01:53:30]  Ronnie would have called me for Charlie Sheen last night.  Ronnie would have called me.  Where was it?  Radio City.  Right there.  Fucking.  But,  Mark Ruffalo is a good actor.  Good one, Jim.  Do you think?  I like Ruffalo.  Yeah.  Jimmy just went,  Yeah, fucking.  I just ran out of steam.  I'm going to run out of steam.  I like Mark Ruffalo a lot.  And you know who I really like is,  I really like.  Bill Pullman?  He's natural.  Sam Neill?  A real fucking,  he's like a regular fucking, 
[01:54:00]  sorry.  Who else do you like?  I really like,  not Ryan Gosling.  Yeah,  Ryan Gosling?  I don't know who he is.  I know who he is.  I don't know one thing he's done.  He's fucking terrific.  He was in like,  the Mickey Mouse Club too.  Jack Black is very good.  I agree.  Guy's fucking,  the eyebrow goes up,  you're like,  uh oh.  Stuff's about to happen.  We're in trouble now.  Hey,  how did Arthur do?  Was that this weekend?  Oh yeah,  yeah.  Well,  he's got the,  oh sorry,  Ryan Gosling.  Because it came out 
[01:54:30]  at the same time  as another fucking comedy,  that high,  that he has.  No,  but that high thing,  they also split the money,  the high times,  or whatever the fuck it is.  Soul Surfer?  No,  Your Highness.  Your Highness.  Oh,  that comes out?  No,  that was out.  They both fucking,  oh shit,  didn't do well then.  Neither one of them did  big money.  Have you noticed,  the promos for all like comedy,  like all movie promos,  it's almost like by design,  we're gonna just show  fucking snippets of conversation,  like no jokes.  Right.  Like,  Your Highness is supposed to be  like this wacky fucking comedy,  and it's literally like, 
[01:55:00]  we've come to protect you.  And it's like,  Your Highness,  Friday.  And you're like,  what?  Like nothing funny.  And like Arthur,  I saw Your Highness.  It's Jennifer Garner  in a fucking magnet,  and he goes,  something in this room  is attracted to you.  That was my Nolte.  That's good.  That's very good.  I'm not saying  the man's not a good actor,  Ronnie,  but Christ,  you gotta take that  hell,  Stavros.  That was fucking good.  It is.  That was fucking  amazing to watch this thing.  The first one  through the window  to skylight.  I gotta take this shit  from Kevin Riley's  little boy. 
[01:55:30]  Fucking damn it.  For 8.30,  that's good Nick Nolte.  Great.  He's getting there.  It's so much better  than when we started  this morning.  It's gonna be the evolution  of Nick Nolte by 10.  You alright, Jay?  I wish you did.  Are we telling Roland  on Thin Red Line  when he tells,  you gotta take that  hell, Stavros.  I don't give a shit.  I got good men out there.  That was bad.  Can we get Roland's  top five before he leaves?  Top five what?  Nick Nolte's?  Top five Nick Nolte films. 
[01:56:00]  Top five Nick Nolte films.  No, Nick Nolte's.  Not films.  Don't hamstring him.  He went 48 hours.  No, Nick Nolte's.  Anything.  What's your second?  Any genre of Nick Nolte's.  Another fucking 48 hours?  The follow-up?  Was he?  I don't think he was  in that one, was he?  Yeah, of course he was.  Roland.  This ain't the fucking  Charlie Sheen concert.  This is real.  This is fucking real.  You fucking asshole.  He went to sleep at noon  and that's why  he didn't get to go  to Charlie Sheen.  Something fucking happened. 
[01:56:30]  I can't let that go.  Oh, something happened.  Of course.  He didn't have the tickets.  You fucking hibernating  bear son of a bitch.  He wants to be the man  and he just isn't.  That's true.  Poor Roland DeFugo.  He looks funny.  I want to rub Vicks  on his little back.  Little?  Yeah.  He's a fucking bear.  What's your five Springsteens?  Springsteens?  No, no.  He'll rattle it off, though.  What are your top five  Bruce Nolte's?  Bruce Nolte's.  Surprise us.  Incident on 57th Street.  Mm-hmm.  We'll go with...  Oh, wait.  What?  Incident on 57th Street. 
[01:57:00]  No, no, no.  What did you just say?  Well...  Just say what you just said.  I don't remember.  What song?  And I said, and...  What?  Just repeat.  What was the first song you said?  Incident on 57th Street.  All right.  They said 52nd.  All right.  Go ahead.  No, 57th Street.  How did he say that?  That's where we worked.  I said that.  What was that first word?  Incident.  Say that again.  Incident on 57th Street.  Yeah.  He just kind of rushes.  Roland just goes from like...  She's like a fucking drunk leaving the Grasshopper Bar and Grill.  He's fucking Pequonic.  It's the same street. 
[01:57:30]  Go ahead.  I enjoy...  Talk to me.  Off the promise.  How many times have you seen Springsteen?  160.  That's not true.  Yeah, it is.  He follows him around.  He sees the sound checks and everything.  That's why we're asking.  This guy's seen Bruce Morton.  Bruce's uncle seen him.  Something.  We're here in the...  Good to see you.  We're here in the ultimate top five list because this guy knows it.  Talk to me, you said? 
[01:58:00]  Talk to me.  It's a fun song live.  I don't know what it is.  Fun.  Sing a little bit.  The Fever.  The Fever.  Sing a little Talk to Me because I don't know what it is.  Hey, you talk to me.  Talk to me.  That's good.  That's good, Springsteen.  I don't think he says...  It's Big Springsteen.  You know, you'll fuck him on the phone.  All right, what else?  Give us the eight.  What is he up to, two to go?  Hold on, time out. 
[01:58:30]  What is this?  Stop coming through.  Don't it look like a wallet?  I just love it.  She's a pretty girl.  A couple of beautiful girls.  What are you doing tonight?  K-Kat Club rolling.  Smoke this.  You betcha, buddy.  Get your five out, Roland.  Get it out.  It's tough.  What about Midian Cross the River?  You like that, Roland?  Yeah.  You ever feel fucking bad?  No, but that's good if it goes into Jungle Land life. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, it's got to be a fucking back-to-back.  Sure.  Jungle Land, I do enjoy it.  Fucking Lincoln Logs?  You can hook all that shit up together.  It's like fucking...  We will rock you and we are the champions.  They've got to be back-to-back.  Well, that's just crazy.  I like the Jungle Land.  Don't punch his ears.  What else, Roland?  Probably Kitty's Back is one of my favorites.  Thunder Crack.  Yeah?  What are you saying?  Spirits in the Night?  That's fit for you.  That was really good, too, yes.  Lazy Jane, intermission man.  Lazy Bob on Twitter wants to know, Roland, how was it? 
[01:59:30]  Tell Lazy Bob to get cancer.  No, there's a good one.  How was it like to star in Despicable Me?  Words hurt.  That's a great observation if you saw the movie.  I didn't see it.  Is it good?  Candy's Room?  No?  It's an animated film.  I do enjoy it, but it has to go Candy's Room and T-She's a one.  I'm going to go Brilliant Disguise.  And this is the fucking dullest shit we've ever talked about.  All right, yeah, we're done with the one.  It's done.  Can I hear this guy's Nick Nolte impression? 
[02:00:00]  He's got one?  It's not going to be better than mine, Stavros.  I got a good man out there.  I can't.  Staten Island, Jimmy.  What's up, brother?  Good morning, boys.  When he was in affliction, he was pulling out his tookies going,  Jesus Christ, it's like, God damn.  You know?  And he ripped it out with a pair of pliers.  That wasn't bad.  Your phone connected.  Do it again.  You heard me.  No, I'm actually, I'm actually.  See, they don't believe us.  I'm really not fucking with you.  I'm an asshole, but I'm not.  No, dude, I'm not fucking with you. 
[02:00:30]  Your phone was really bad.  It actually was not a bad Nolte, but you only did one line.  It wasn't as good as mine.  Okay, right, I'll do it again.  Okay.  Slow it down.  Slow it down.  Move the phone away a little bit.  Okay, I'm moving it.  Rub it on your bush.  Let's go.  Put it in your pants.  Oh, nice.  Old school.  Let's do it.  I'm going to fucking do it.  Go ahead, man.  Jesus Christ, that's my god damn sauce.  It's not bad.  It's Nolte with a bad phone.  It's not bad.  No, it's Nolte in fucking 89.  That's not bad. 
[02:01:00]  Nothing with Nolte is when he does that whisper.  That is true.  You just got a bad phone.  Yeah.  What's the first Nolte?  No, I'm steen.  This guy had a 25-hour energy drink.  This is the new fucking game here.  What's the first time you remember, Nolte, where you're like, oh, I know that fucking...  48 hours.  Who'll stop the rain?  It's got to be 48.  I say rich man, poor man.  See, I didn't see that.  Oh, no, weeds.  Fucking classic.  Who'll stop the rain?  Fuck.  What? 
[02:01:30]  Who'll stop the rain?  I didn't know what that is.  It's an early, very early.  It was great.  What about weeds?  It's a dope thing, right?  He's a fucking dealer.  I don't remember.  I remember the song at the end.  Yeah, I believe so.  I think any of the movies where the guy's back from Vietnam and he's still kind of fucked  up.  Coming home.  Yeah, you get away with a lot of shit once you got back from Vietnam.  Who's Pryor's movie?  They don't do a lot of those movies, though.  Pryor did a movie where him and Mario Kidder kissed on film.  That was a big one.  Superman?  No! 
[02:02:00]  My hate doesn't allow it.  Here's like a fucking weird thing they do in those movies.  You're back from Vietnam, but you're still wearing the fucking jacket.  And you're like...  You gotta wear the jacket.  Yeah, you look like Linderman.  Seriously.  You're not helping yourself.  You gotta wear it.  You look like a fucking outcast right away.  Everybody with the T-Birds.  It's like, I'm off the football team, but I'm wearing a helmet around town.  Doesn't make any...  Doesn't make any sense.  Get a new jacket.  You're trying to fucking fit back in. 
[02:02:30]  De Niro did one of the best jobs probably ever of being the uncomfortable guy back from  Vietnam.  Dear Hunter.  Uh, fuckers, I was gonna say, but yeah.  Well, taxi driver, was he supposed to be bad?  I fucking had it instead of a brick.  Was he a Vietnam vet and fucking taxi driver?  He just fucking came off that one.  I don't know.  He said he was in the...  I think he wore the jacket.  No, that was Rick Shaw driver.  He was in the Marine.  Oh, yeah.  He was in the Marine Corps, because when he applies for his license, the guy says...  The guy says, will you drive in Harlem?  And he goes, anytime, anyplace. 
[02:03:00]  That's not an impression.  No, it's good, though.  It was very good.  Shut up.  Do you talking to me?  He goes, anytime, anyplace.  And he goes, weekends, holidays?  He goes, anytime, anyplace.  And he goes, how'd you drive in record?  And he goes, clean.  Like my conscience.  And the guy goes...  The guy slings back his chair and goes, you gonna break my chops?  Because if you are, you can take it right under the arches.  And he goes, says here, you're in the military.  And that's when it turns for him.  And he goes, yes, sir.  He was in the Marine Corps.  And the guy goes, yeah, no kidding, me too.  And that's how he gets the job, because he was in the fucking...  But I think he was a Vietnam vet. 
[02:03:30]  I was hoping we'd get somewhere towards the end of the day.  Anytime, anyplace.  How'd you drive in record?  Clean.  Like my conscience.  Dice doing fucking...  I listened to the worst of them.  You were like a crazy man.  He texted me out of nowhere.  I'm like, what is he talking about?  Bro, I'm fucking driving in my car.  And you guys said Dice in is the same time as Judd Apatow.  Yeah, he bothered Judd that day.  And Dice decides to fucking do impressions to impress Judd Apatow so he could be in the funny movie.  Funny Sandler, that fucking cocksucker. 
[02:04:00]  I mean, don't get me wrong.  He's a good kid, right?  And he was trying to impress Judd Apatow.  And you forget, he's a fucking great impressionist, Dice.  Yes.  And he nails him.  But then you could tell too much time has eroded the fucking sandcastle of the impressions.  So then when he did his Pacino, which to me was always like, wow, like spooky good.  It was very strange.  Like a little off.  And he was old Pacino as well.  And then Judd Apatow does fucking Tony Roberts out of nowhere. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, that's right.  And everyone starts laughing.  He goes, oh, twins, Max, can you believe it?  And then fucking Dice just ignores the guy.  And Opie goes, hold on a minute, Dice.  The fucking director of Funny People just did Tony Roberts.  And Dice goes, but why?  Who wants to hear that?  And it was like the most insane thing.  But it was a perfect thing.  But you know that fucking Dice never watched a Woody Allen movie in his life.  Probably right.  You know?  Probably right.  It was confusing to him.  He, it's 1991 all the time to him. 
[02:05:00]  Like me and my wife saw him in Vegas and it was like a hundred-  My wife and I.  You're in the room.  You're a fucking, you fucking motherfucker.  Keep him here.  Keep him here, Ronnie.  And he was in that weird room with like a fucking fisherman's net on the wall.  He came on stage to Fame by Marilyn Manson.  But he let the whole song play before he walked out.  And everyone's looking around like, is he, the fuck, is he an O-show?  Fame!  Ron's like, yeah, we know how Fame goes.  Wait, is that a remake of the Irene Cara song by fucking Marilyn Manson? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, she's going to live forever.  She's a good movie.  She's Coco.  Montgomery!  With Ralph Garcia.  I met him once.  He hated me.  The guy who played Ralph Garcia.  Make sure you get back to-  Is it a Beretta episode?  Make sure you get back to the Dice-  Who gives a turkey?  But you know, we got Coco coming in later on today.  Oh, wasn't that great?  It wasn't supposed to be this way.  Put your thumb in your mouth.  It wasn't supposed to be this way.  Her awful fucking candy corn tits. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, she just went in that other room.  Oh, she was wonderful.  I want to dance like Bruno's father.  Remember him on the cab, his awful dancing?  My son!  So Dice what?  Get back to the Dice.  That's right.  That's good.  That's good.  Way to pull it back together.  Let's do it.  Perfect.  And then all of a sudden he goes, the insanity of it was, the razor's edge of Dice doing the 
[02:06:30]  I'm the fucking greatest that ever bowed down at my feet.  Could you get me in your next movie?  Like him fucking ricocheting back and forth between being the Dice man and trying to be  nice to Judd to get him into a fucking Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler, like, I could be in  funny movie, people with the movie, watch this now.  And he's like, and it was like watching a fucking child dance in front of the TV.  And then he goes, he goes, these are impressions, you know?  And Judd Apatow goes, I remember watching you at Pips out and he goes, who cares? 
[02:07:00]  And like, he couldn't fucking get his brain around, am I fucking kissing Judd's ass or  am I the fucking king of all things in the world?  Am I Dice the greatest man in the world or am I trying to get a job from Judd Apatow because  I don't want to play Uncle Sputchy's Chuckle Hut in my fucking leather coat in August?  And then he did a fucking Sammy Davis Jr. impression, which was like, not great, better  than my, my Nolte's getting better. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, it is.  But it was good enough that you knew he was doing Sammy Davis Jr.  But it was bad enough that it was fucking humiliating to listen to in your car six months  after the fact, and he's singing, what kind of fool, can you find it?  He, someone has to find this.  You're right, we got it.  He's singing, what kind of fool am I?  And, and Opie goes, Opie goes, look, he's got the, Opie doesn't know what to say.  He goes, look, he's got the lip and everything.  And at one point, obviously, I guess Dice stands up and like, everyone's so uncomfortable 
[02:08:00]  that three guys at once go, oh, he's up, he's up.  Like, he's the fucking drunk.  We did a Ronnie B.  It's just very uncomfortable.  He's up.  He's up.  Like, he stood up and nobody knew it.  He's like, I'm not the only one.  I can be, I could be in a fucking movie.  That cocksucker.  And then he went on and on about like how it was just the fucking.  And then, then they exchanged numbers and Judd's still didn't want to give Dice his number.  Oh, he goes, can I get in touch with you without having to go through like fucking 
[02:08:30]  12 people?  And Judd Apatow goes, sure, but can it be like four people?  And he goes, come on, who's that what to who now?  He couldn't fucking make up his mind if he was the fucking Dice Man, a gag, or if he needed  a fucking job.  We got Iraq.  Iraq's going to fight it.  All right.  It was fucking, and then you text me, I'm like, what are you talking about?  And then Anthony did fucking, how fucking hard is it to fight?  You got a computer in front of you. 
[02:09:00]  You're spelling Dice wrong.  Then Anthony did Pacino.  He goes, it always sounded like it.  His mouth wired showed.  He's like, the man you see before you.  He starts doing Pacino and Dice goes, come on, stop it now.  I'm doing Pacino now.  Like he wasn't even, there was nothing connecting him to the fucking human race.  Right.  He needed it all.  He needed it all and more.  But he needed, it was, oh my God.  And my wife, when we saw him in Vegas, we left because we had fucking panic attacks because  it was the strangest.  You can, you can get Dice Pit seats for $200, premium seating for $150, or general admission 
[02:09:30]  for $75.  And I said, I'll take general admission.  And she goes, we're all out of general admission.  I go, all right, then fucking premium seating.  My premium seating, the guy behind me is sitting at the bar and his knees are against my chair.  Like, it's, it's like a fucking bar that he was performing in.  And my wife goes, oh my God, I gotta get, I'm having a panic, like loud.  Right.  Everyone's looking around like, this is really fucking strange show.  And we're in the cab, like sad, leaving this fucking show. 
[02:10:00]  And my wife goes, do you think he thinks he's doing good?  And I said, absolutely.  And Opie agrees with me on this.  Absolutely.  And in his defense, and he's one of the greatest comics that ever fucking lived.  No one's can fucking rock the garden like Dice rocked the garden.  That's in the books.  But the fact, like he can sit in his room in the Hilton or wherever he was performing  and go, people come from all over the world to see the Dicemen.  And there's a couple Japanese people in the audience and a family. 
[02:10:30]  So he's right.  But it was a fucking tough hustle.  But this fucking Candyman shit.  We got it, we got it, we got it.  You want to hear it?  Yes.  Okay, here it is.  Please let me stop talking.  We got the Beatles and all this sort of fucking things going on.  Wait, I have to open my eyes.  And then Sammy Davis.  No, I have to open my eyes.  Ed Sullivan didn't curse.  Opie made everyone close their eyes.  He didn't curse.  He's like a fucking child.  I'm sorry.  Close your eyes, everybody.  I'm sorry.  All right.  That show tonight includes Sammy Davis Jr., okay?  Why can't I find my eye? 
[02:11:00]  Perfect.  I'm sorry.  Boo!  No, see, that was an effect.  It's an...  What?  ...kind of man is this to never fall in love?  You do the mouth and everything.  He's up.  He's up.  It seems like...  Now he's standing.  All right, he's standing.  Glasses are on.  I'm the only one that I've been dreaming of. 
[02:11:30]  A kunk, a kunk, a kunk, kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a junk.  Why can't I...  And that...  I'm just doing that for you.  That's it.  Oh.  All right.  Now I just want to listen to the rest of that bit.  And then he gets stuck.  He takes a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk.  A kunk, a kunk, a kunk.  And I don't know...  Did Sammy Davis ever do that?  I don't know. 
[02:12:00]  Did he ever do that kunk, a kunk, a kunk?  I feel like...  I can't...  I can't...  I feel like he did now, though.  I feel like he must have.  I feel like he must have.  He's got the mouth and everything.  We didn't know what to say.  That means we didn't know what to say.  He's got the mouth.  It was like...  Anthony was like being like his nice Italian aunt.  Like, look at him.  He's got the mouth.  He's doing all this.  With a 300-pound nephew.  Look at his nice...  Look at him.  He's handsome.  Look at the collar on that shirt.  How nice it is.  Let's do this again.  That one section.  A kunk.  Yeah, that part.  A kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk, a kunk. 
[02:12:30]  A kunk, a kunk.  What can I...  A kunk, a kunk, a kunk.  I'm just doing that.  A kunk for you.  I'm Jimmy, who's like...  You guys have been friends forever.  Many years.  Even Jimmy goes...  And he's wearing glasses.  He's wearing glasses.  Because we didn't know what to say.  They're just stating facts.  Because facts are helpful.  Yeah, you said he's wearing glasses.  He's going to cut the mouth and everything.  Fuck.  I'm making people close their eyes.  You made everyone fucking close their eyes. 
[02:13:00]  Because it's like the real guys in the room.  Oh my God.  I'm confused.  You know, Judd hasn't been back since.  Geez, I wonder why.  I know.  Probably him and Riser on the fucking cell phones with each other right now.  What was that about?  No way.  What are they doing there?  It gets weird.  Two ships and two...  It gets weird in here.  I try to fucking...  It does.  You fucking just swing your head at the monitor.  The Riser came up.  We wanted to see if he was on TV.  Oh.  Wow.  Remember?  Yeah.  We'll turn up the TV. 
[02:13:30]  We'll play more guys doing impressions.  Sure, whatever you want.  We move like fucking fish in here.  We're moving at the same time.  It was like a fucking drum corps.  I want to know more.  I want to know more about Jay's son.  What?  Because the monkey fucking...  It was a fucking great story.  Seriously, that story...  I'm in a zoo, Rick.  That story was so funny.  But here was the sad thing.  I want to hear about Ronnie's kid.  He's around to fucking promote his TV show.  And he's struggling a little bit.  And then you come in crushing, doing funny fucking stories. 
[02:14:00]  And that helped him from being helpful to him.  Yeah, he's out of his way.  He didn't have one.  At that point.  He wanted to have a nice story.  How the fuck do you know...  How are you going to be...  I can't stop doing that fucking Tracy.  What about your kid?  He's a fucking Sammy Davis Jr. impressionist.  He's got the mouth and everything.  And he's wearing glasses.  Jimmy!  And let's keep our eyes closed.  Let's get him again.  Herculee!  Herculee!  He's a beautiful boy!  There we go.  One more time.  One more time. 
[02:14:30]  Account!  Account!  Account!  Account!  All from the beginning.  All right, we can do that.  Can we play this?  Not right away.  We should play this in the 10 o'clock hour.  The whole fucking segment now.  All right, go ahead, E-Rod.  We got the Beatles and all this other fucking things going on.  Wait, I have to open my eyes.  And then Sammy Davis.  No, I'm going to open my eyes.  Ed Sullivan didn't curse.  No, no.  During rehearsal, he would.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Our show tonight includes Sammy Davis Jr., okay? 
[02:15:00]  Uh-huh.  Why can't I find my eye?  Perfect.  Boo!  No, see, that was an effect.  The fucking eye joke.  It's in 63.  How kind of man is this to never fall in love?  You do the mouth and everything.  He's up. 
[02:15:30]  He's up.  Seems like.  Now he's standing.  All right, he's standing.  He glances her eyes.  I'm the only one that I've been dreaming of.  A kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink.  Why can't I?  And that, I'm just doing that for you.  That's an episode of the fucking Flintstones when they get hypnotized.  A kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, a kink, yabba, 
[02:16:00]  dabba, do it.  But Apatow could have thrown him in that fucking movie.  What's the big deal?  It's him.  Yeah, give him a couple minutes.  They had every other.  There's a lot of guys they probably should have used in that movie.  You know who else was in that movie?  Riser.  Was in that fucking movie.  Yeah, he was.  He did a walk-on, yeah.  Ray Romano was funny as hell.  Wait, you like funny people?  No.  I didn't either.  I didn't or wouldn't see it.  I'll tell you why.  Way too fucking long.  There's not a single likable fucking human being in that movie.  Not one person in that movie has one likable quality.  The girl's cheating on the husband.  Sandler's a fucking cock to Rogan. 
[02:16:30]  Rogan throws fucking Seth.  Oh, no, Seth.  Rogan throws fucking Jonah Hill under the bus to fucking go on tour with Sandler.  Sandler's a fucking dick to him the whole time.  You know, didn't fucking cheat.  It was like, is anyone fucking nice?  And every single joke was a dick joke.  Like, everyone stand out.  My dick's not as big as I want a dick.  It's good to be here.  I have a really big penis, you know.  And, uh...  I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. 
[02:17:00]  What's amazing is the gag movie posters and movies they had for Sandler  weren't really far from the front leg.  It was Sandler's head on a baby's body.  Like, I want some more breast milk.  And what was the merman?  Yeah, he would have done it.  I can't believe Ron Bennington would say that  Remember we were supposed to get him recently?  Oh yeah, remember Roland?  He made me watch that fucking movie  Where's the band?  What band? 
[02:17:30]  There's a band in here right now that you fucking promoted  But no one else would  I didn't want to say Foo Fighters, I didn't think we were supposed to  I used to talk to Dave Grohl all the fucking time  And now he's wandering around with the Foo Fighters  You can't get him in  You fucking put him over  He needs someone to talk about his new band after Nirvana  Listening Jimmy to Dice do that fucking Sammy D  Fucking really, be honest  And not saying anything bad about Dice  But he, what makes me crazy hysterical  Is he fucking is trying to act like he's goofing off 
[02:18:00]  But he fucking really went down and got it  He swung from the fucking heels  He fucking wasn't going like  Hey just, you know, just get a hit  That's all we need  All we need is one pin Rodney  He was fucking up and decking him  He was fucking putting him in a walk off  If he wanted a fucking walk off  And he again, then he could make up his mind  If he was goofing off  Or if he was the fucking greatest entertainer that ever lived  Oh, Grant Anderson  Yeah, we could do home run calls  We're going to break here 
[02:18:30]  Fuck  Oh, why?  Why not?  I wouldn't mind a good tinkle  Yeah, I know when Jimmy needs to leak  You can see it in his face  Will you do a cuckoo for me?  Ronnie's got it  I can't  I can't  You know what I'm going to do?  Let's fucking play that for Dave Grohl  Let's fucking seriously try to Dave  When we get him in, right?  Grab Dave Grohl and then make him feel uncomfortable  The way you guys do  Impossible  Fucking five minutes of uncomfortable  Dave Grohl's a rock star  He's not going to be feeling comfortable in here  Oh, when I was on SNL  I was at the after party  And I go up to Dave Grohl  And I go  Hey, you want to go smoke a joint? 
[02:19:00]  And he goes  Uh, I'm kind of doing  And I was so out of it  And so fucking crazy at the time  He has his fucking arm around his paternal and maternal grandmothers  He's holding like two old ladies  And you don't notice  And I just walk around  Hey, man, you want to go smoke a joint?  Oh, Jesus  And he goes  Yeah, I'm kind of doing something right now  But thanks, though, man  And then I racked focus and went  Wow, I'm not even seeing human beings  I was ill  We're going to take a little break  We'll be right back 
[02:19:30]  We're going to talk about how young you are  Yeah, for Jimmy's P  On SNL  A count, a count, a count, a count, a count, a count, a count, a count, a count, a count, a joke  Why can't I  You know, and that  I'm just doing that for you  The virus  Sirius XM  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  All right  He has the fuck  Save it for the air, gentlemen  Sam  Sam, why don't you grab a mic real fast  Because Sam is always trying to, like, stir shit up 
[02:20:00]  No  And you're telling me that Roland's a little mad right now, huh?  What happened, Sam?  Well, you guys brought up Roland  And I just said he was kind of tired of you guys calling him a liar  He's getting a little sick of it  Who called him a liar?  Well, for the people that are tuning in for the first time  Ever?  I was supposed to go, ever  I was supposed to go to Charlie Sheen last night with Roland  I was just waiting for the phone call  As I'm watching Tiger Blow last night  Or yesterday afternoon with the Masters thing  And I figured, Masters is over  I'm going to roll up to Radio City Music Hall with my friend Roland 
[02:20:30]  Check out the Charlie Sheen thing  And then I would have a full report for everybody  Never got the call from Roland  Turns out he took NyQuil, did he say, at noon?  And slept from noon until now  So I called him out on him  There's no fucking way  But he swears that's what happened  That's why we didn't get to go to Charlie Sheen  So how did he wake up in time to do the show?  Well, he was here early  Like, I got here a little before five  And Roland was already sitting in his office  What was that about?  I don't know, it was weird  This is a vacation week  Maybe he walked over from fucking Charlie Sheen across the street  He was there at the Charlie Sheen after show 
[02:21:00]  But you're saying he's getting mad now?  Well, because you guys keep bringing him in to tell him he's lying  Well, then Ronnie brings up  This is Ronnie's thing now  Because Ronnie wants everyone to be uncomfortable  I don't even understand that  We're all walking from the bathroom  I'm with you  And Ronnie's basically saying  Look, there's which part?  Pat Smear  It was Pat  And you go, look, they're going into Howard  And we learned that the Foo Fighters weren't doing Howard Stern today  Roland swore that the Foo Fighters weren't doing Howard or us 
[02:21:30]  I don't know anything about that  Russell Brand do Howard?  Oh, yeah, yeah  When was he here?  Oh, maybe he didn't do it  No, he didn't do anything  So Arthur didn't do well  No, but I think it was crazy to put it up against Your Highness  You got all  I would have thought Your Highness  You got a fucking tank  Same audience, right?  And Arthur would have done great  No, he's also in Hop  That's another Russell movie  He's got two movies out at once  Right  Half animated  He's the studio  How bad did Arthur Doe?  Do we know?  It's in second place  So we had the number one and number two movies  Yeah, but it did 12  Which means that it drops down to three this weekend 
[02:22:00]  That's a bomb  It's not  Yeah, it's certainly not where they wanted it to be  So where's Rowan?  So now he's got to explain the Foo Fighters thing  Did you see Ryan Gosling  Yes, I forget him  Lars and the Real Girl  Yeah  I mean, the kid's incredible  He's got a couple movies coming out too  Now he's doing too much  Really?  Slow it down, yeah  I like him as the indie guy  I like an indie guy  Slow your roll, big man  Yeah  Ronnie likes the indies  I like you and Ed Burns  That's where I'm fucking comfortable  You know what?  Ed Burns started Jay Moores 
[02:22:30]  Oh, really?  Ed Burns and the African American community  Started the Jay Moores  Oh, that's Jay Moores  I thought Tracy Morgan started the Jay Moores  Yeah, it was Tracy  Yeah  Roland's hiding  I can see it already  This ain't happening  So tell me, how did Roland and Vos get into it?  Let me tell you something  I do a thousand setups a day  Look at this 12 pack  He just holds his fucking shirt up  And shows you his thorax  He has the fucking worst body  Even though he's in shape  The star-bellied snitch  We said that 
[02:23:00]  Be careful with Roland  Because he will snap  And he's very scary  Well, do you think he knew the truth before he told you  Or he just found out later?  Which one?  The Foo Fighters of the Charlottes Sheen?  Yeah, the Foo first  The one where he was saying  No, they're not doing anybody  You can't be touched  He says it's a workaround  Here's some information about Paul Reyes  Okay, let's see  How did Rich Vos and Roland  My two dads  Which bit are we doing now?  You want to do the Rich Vos?  I want to know how Rich Vos and Roland  Get into a physical altercation  I don't remember  Does Zirok or somebody else remember? 
[02:23:30]  It was just an argument that had gone awry  I don't remember exactly  It was on the 57th Street facility  And how does it go to standing up to touching?  Well, it was like  Roland will say very, very personal things  If you slam him a certain way  Like, you know, get out a comic slam you  Roland just kind of goes  Like, Roland goes fucking  Michael Richard's Laugh Factory very quickly  Wow  Oh yeah, he's that guy  And then Vos goes  You don't fucking say that about me  Exactly 
[02:24:00]  You know, and Vos  Vos wants to stand up for himself  And Vos always says he's a black belt all the time  I'm a black belt  My greatest moment  Is I was on a date with a girl  And we saw Vos outside a Chinese restaurant  And he showed us a karate kick  And he slipped in garbage juice  It's one of the greatest things I've ever seen  He fell on his back in garbage juice  Throwing a karate kick  His little Jewish feet  That's one of the greatest stories  His fucking  Now, Roland  Yes  Let this be known  Let this be known that this is a Roddy B thing  Me and you are still close  Call, boss  Well, Roland 
[02:24:30]  Shut up  But here's the thing right here  Sam came down  Blah, blah, blah, blah  I got other things to do  He's really getting mad  He really is mad?  I told you  What?  But who pulled it?  Who just fucking brought this in?  Your guy's sense  You just get a little fucking respect  Who?  What?  What?  Roland's getting mad  I told you  Why are you angry, Roland?  It's not good  Because  Great answer  Because you understand the back story  Why we don't get that person  Well, that's  Ope wants to know why  It's not for the air 
[02:25:00]  I told him in the hallway  It's not for the air  Well, then you would have to tell Ope  Oh, you didn't tell me that  Yeah, you did  In the hallway  I knew it  The thing you told me?  Mm-hmm  But why would that be a problem?  Because  It's like  I don't mention names  I won't get in trouble  I'm not saying names  I know, but  Oh, you don't want  Yes  It was a workaround  Well, we're just surprised  That the Foo Fighters  Are doing that  Well, what do you mean by workarounds?  There were some workarounds  Yes  Instead of going through  The proper channels  You know the corporate lingo  Okay  There was a workaround  So good to be in a workaround situation 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, it's a workaround situation  Answer my question  Or you'll be standing tall  Before the man  Good call  That was nice  Yeah, because it was  It was a hoo-hoo call  So if you want to talk to a hoo-hoo  Yeah, we'd love to talk to him  Get him in here  I can  Go get the hoo-hoo  Why not?  You're a fucking grown man  You go wherever you want  It's a free country  Roland, you having a tough morning?  It's a free American country  But when you're in my cab  No busting heads, right?  Roland's having a tough morning  I can see it in his face  This is the Roland  You don't want to fuck with  Right here  This is not the ticklish  Fucking Roland right now  But you told me Roland 
[02:26:00]  Was fucking really  Putting a dump on your show  You said  What the fuck is up with Roland  Fucking me up  But here's the thing  I don't understand  Why would Sam bring that in  To everybody's attention  Yeah, Roland  And then Roland comes down here  And doesn't want to be here  This was a Sam thing  Sam said  Sam, you originally fucking said  Oh, this is great  This would be great radio  Roland's getting really pissed off  Then you bring him down  And now he's fucking hurt for real  It didn't work out for him  You're like fucking Jill Zarin  The housewives  Yeah  That's what Sam is  He's a shit stirrer  Oh, that's bad  You know all the shows  Roland, I'm just disappointed 
[02:26:30]  In the Charlie Sheen thing  Night Quill  Slept dead noon  Roland, I got it  Look  You know  You and I get along great  The last thing I want  Is for you to put your fucking hands on  You're a little  Like a fucking crazy person  But  We want to  Who's your boss?  No one really  No  I thought he was just superior  Yeah, he is  Look how strange  That fellow looks  Jesus Christ  Oh my god  I hate him for three different reasons  Fucking ADD radio  I know, I know two of them  Jay Moore  ADD radio  So your boss says 
[02:27:00]  I want to go see Charlie  When did you ask Roland  About Charlie Sheen?  Last week  It was the thing Roland  And now that he's  Saved to his face  You're like  And this fucking idiot  You said  I asked this fucking idiot  To get me Charlie Sheen  Roland and I are actually friends  Outside this place  I respect him, yes  We're friends outside this place  Why do you call him a fucking idiot  When he's not in the room?  Because I'm fucking mad now  Yeah  I respect you  We don't talk to anybody  Roland, I think you blew me off yesterday  And I just want to know why  And it wasn't NyQuil  Thursday he asked for the tickets 
[02:27:30]  Wednesday  Even better  Wednesday is even better  Wednesday, hump day  He asked for the tickets  You said your friend would get you in  My friend had got the passes  But I was  So then why didn't you get the tickets Wednesday after work?  There was no NyQuil then  Because I wasn't going to see him until Saturday  NyQuil knocks out that  My buddy, but I was six  I just stayed home  Your buddy?  Yeah  When do you call a fucking Ticketmaster?  What?  I'm not rich  I'm not rich  You're a fucking producer of a show  It's all a write-off  The whole world's a write-off 
[02:28:00]  Not the way  Knock a write-off  Write-off  Roland, very suspicious  I just  What color was the NyQuil?  Green or red?  Oh, good question  Orange  That's DayQuil  That is DayQuil  Oh, Roland  Roland  Roland  Roland  DayQuil keeps you awake, brother  You took DayQuil  Oh, fuck  And slept for 14 hours  Like a fucking black bear in the woods of Calgary  What days today?  Pretty much, I guess  Well, this really didn't work out on your plan, huh? 
[02:28:30]  No  We just thought you'd be way more entertaining, Roland  Here we go  We're going to Charles Sheen tomorrow  That's me at 1030  Charles Sheen was last night  That was 1030 Saturday night  Oh, Jimmy, you've done it again  Roland writes me at 1038  Wait for my buddy to clear the passes  Yeah, we  What was this?  1038 Saturday night  And then a minute later  I'm sick now  Been juicing  I got the sore throat and coughing  Yeah  So that was the first like  Alright, look  Fuck, I'm not going to get the passes 
[02:29:00]  I better start  I better start playing the sick fucking card  1033, you're on it  You got a guy  You got fucking shit happening  1035  I've been juicing  And I'm sick  And I'm sick  In two minutes  You went on a juice fast  And got ill  No  But it was a little progress overnight  No  According to the texts  It's 1030  And I agree with Ronnie  You can't be texted  Past tense  No  And also not  And also  It can't be bad news like this  You know what I mean  I mean he's like fucking  The Charlie Sheen tickets for him 
[02:29:30]  He's like a guy waiting for a bindle  And then he's going to get a text  I'm sick  That's got to be a fucking  That's got to be a conversation  Have you been let down  I feel like I've been let down  This much  From Roland ever before  I feel like our friendship  Doesn't mean anything to you Roland  That I don't even get a phone call  I'm a little uncomfortable  So now I think we need Foo Fighters  To make it all good  Can you make that happen?  Tell Roland  Why not?  The powers to be  He won't let it happen  What's your job title?  But why  What's your job title? 
[02:30:00]  Can I ask a question?  A monkey boy?  No for real  What's your job title?  Talent bugger?  Fucking book something  No he does a good job at that  I'll give him that  Now listen Roland  Can I ask you one question?  Why can't the Foo Fighters  Do Howard and our show?  In your humble opinion  Unplugged  Without you  The one plug  The other unplugged  What?  Done  But why  Why does he care?  Now we're talking in code  He just wants  Cause he's  He won't let 
[02:30:30]  Look I got a lot to say  But I'm trying  Cause I am friends with Roland  Are you a gay guy?  No  He's gonna fucking strangle you  I'm half a slice  Go back to half a slice  No that wasn't  That wasn't disrespectful right?  No no I'm not gay  Not like Fez  Well we don't know that  Where did that come from?  Where did that even come from?  So not only are you  Disappointing your boss  You're taking pot shots  That's why  They have a bad problem  Fez and him already 
[02:31:00]  Have a problem  I talked to him about it  Off the air  I said what is your  Fucking problem with Fez  And it seemed like  Something easily remedied  How come you don't like Fez?  I do  Oh okay  But  Fucking let's hear  I'm so confused  It's getting weird  You don't like Fez  Because of why?  It's not me  It's the whole department  In the world  He bothered the publicist  He creeps around  Like a little creep  And bothering publicists  How can you say  You like someone  And call him a fucking  Little creep  On a radio show  Those are not like words  By hundreds  Yeah right 
[02:31:30]  Well that's the truth  But how does he  Does he creep around  Or is he just trying  To get some guys  For the show  He creeps around  For  Why is he creeping around  Do you get what?  Is he trying to get  Your job you think?  No  What are you trying to get?  People  For what?  Unmasked  That's his job  That's his job  He's doing his fucking job  When you're home  Sleeping on the fucking couch  With NyQuil  Oh shit  Fez is going hey  There's a fucking  Paul Reisers in here  Let's get him  For fucking unmasked  And 
[02:32:00]  Like so Fez is doing  What OP's asking you to do  Right?  But there's a protocol  Fucking protocol  In his face  Literally it happened  With Paul Reisers  When he did our show  The other day  Then Fez said to him  Because Fez produces  The Unmasked show  Hey we also do a show  Called Unmasked  And his people were like  God it'd be great  They got fucking mad  At Fez for that  Why?  He's already coming in  For June for that  So everything was already  Set up  Fez jumps the gun  And bothers publicists 
[02:32:30]  How's that bothering?  Hey  You can't send Jay Moore  We'd love to have you back  Jay  It's people talking  Right  You can't  It's called the world  Of entertainment  No it's not  I'm sorry  And I'm in the world  Of entertainment  And I don't appreciate  You fucking talking to me  Like I don't know  The fucking business  And how fucking  The business works  When fucking human beings  Interact  It's total human nature  To go  Hey Ronnie  When you're in LA  You want to come by  To Melrose Improv  And do a spot  They're human fucking beings  Man  Not human being  Not humans doing  Humans being 
[02:33:00]  Humans being  Ronnie you might want  To move over a little  Roland let's just make sure  There's never physical time  Obi's afraid  You're going to attack me  We've seen it man  Why?  We've seen it  That was a good one Roland  Jay he's the one guy  In this whole fucking place  You don't want to fuck with  I disagree about Fez bothering  I think sometimes  With publishers  A guy like Fez  Just asking is acceptable  I think that's fine  That's how human beings  He's a fucking host of a show  A lot of times  You go to talent  There was something  I was trying to get done recently  And the publicist 
[02:33:30]  Was given a hard time  So I went right to the guy  Because I know him  And he's like  Yeah sure  I mean it was like  Sometimes you have to go right  From person to person  With the other talent  Because publicists  Block things for weird reasons  And they block things  Because of their own  Preconceived notions  And their own prejudices  So if you go right  If Fez goes right  To Paul Reiser  Like if Fez followed the part  And the publicist  Down in the elevator  And was bugging them  That's different  But you said  But he's creeping around  He does  He creeps around  He just hangs around  But this was his own show 
[02:34:00]  Paul Reiser was doing the show  Said I had a nice time  And it  The other guest  Not Paul Reiser  Who?  You told me it was Paul Reiser  No it was the other guest  When we had Danny McBride  Who?  Danny McBride  From Your Highness  How'd that do?  Did good  Yeah?  And what happened?  Should've done two more  Fucking interviews  Yeah  A couple more interviews  Would've helped that movie  You're not a fan  Of his TV show?  Whose show?  Oh no Jay  Jay you're not a fan  I love Eastbound and Down  Oh you do?  I never saw it  I like Eastbound and Down  When you first  When it first came out 
[02:34:30]  You gave me a call  And you fucking were like  I don't get it  Did I?  I don't think so  I remember that  Like it's one of my  Favorite shows  Second season  Not so good though right?  I liked the second season  I got fucking weirded out  At first  I'm like  What's he doing in Mexico?  Everything's changed  But then I  I fucking picked up on it  Then you went with it  Yeah  Roland  Can I talk openly  About the Foo Fighters  In my opinion?  Sure  See this is  One of the problems  With this  This place  The Foo Fighters  Belong on this show  But they're doing Howard  And this is not Roland 
[02:35:00]  I swear to you  Howard has a really good friend  Here that's in  A very high place  And purposely  Fucks with the show  He's kind of two-faced  He sort of looks  He sort of looks at us  Like he's helping our show  But then at times  Like this  He's not helping our show  On purpose  And you think  If he's working for the company  He would do the right thing  And get the Foo Fighters  On Howard  And our show  It's a no-brainer  You want Billy Hayes  To go talk to this guy?  It's a no-brainer  Is that  Accurate 
[02:35:30]  Or you don't want  You can say no comment  No comment  Accurate  Yes  That's true  So why do you have a problem  Why would it matter  If the Foo Fighters  Do a great interview for Howard  And then stop by here  And say hi  Why would it matter  To that guy  And I'm not going to mention  His name  That is really close to Howard  Nobody knows  Unless it's very personal  I don't know  Weird  I have no idea  Dave Grohl did our show  A million fucking times  Why is it a problem for Fez  So you and I  Are coming at him  Like a two-pronged attack  We're like fucking  Taking New Orleans 
[02:36:00]  Back from the British here  Trying to get things done  Why the fuck  Can't Fez  Say to a guest  Like that's how  Fucking people talk  Like  I don't understand  And I'm not  I'm really just curious  Like I don't know  Why that would  Ruffle your feathers  It's just when  When he leaves  Publicist comes to me  Why does somebody  Do this  Why  What makes a publicist  Such a big fucking deal  Your publicist  Is supposed to be talked to  Like  So you're not bothering  The fucking stars  Well they said  Like I won't be pitched 
[02:36:30]  When I'm here  Just send me email  So what  Who gives a fuck  Who you are  Well then that's what  He said about Fez  Who you are  Like bothering me  Who said that  Danny McBride  No but not to Fez  Fez only heard this after  The guy was real  Fucking nice to him  But then Roland  The publicist was  Yeah  And then he said  Don't pitch it to me  In my face  But he didn't say that  But you know what  Any  I will say this  Any publicist  Who's angry that a guy  Is saying hey  Could you come do this  Interview to the publicist  Is a shit  Publicists are really weird  They're a necessary evil  You have to play with them 
[02:37:00]  Because they exist  You have to  But they are shit  But the majority of them  Are fucking horrendous  But Roland is not  The publicist  Roland is made Fez  Right  I know  And isn't the whole  I'm not mad at him  I can waste two  It's the whole  You wouldn't not be mad at him  And say you wouldn't waste  Two fucking breaths on him  Those two thoughts  Don't coincide without anger  And isn't it the job  Of the publicist  To search out places  For their people  Yes  Exactly  So why would that bother  Now you take  Jay Moore  When he replaces Regis  If someone says 
[02:37:30]  I'd like to do  A fucking article  And Jay  You want people  Asking about it  Well you got it  Or at least  Or at least  Go to the publicist  Then the publicist  Goes back to the office  And figures out  What makes sense  Call back  Pettisaber  I'll do it  So Fezzi going  To the publicist  I don't really see  That as a problem  The department already  Had Dan McBriery  Booked on  I'm asking  Planning things  Ahead of time  So what  So then it should be  Doubly not a problem  Right  And they should have went  Hey funny you should  Why am I yelling  They should say  Hey funny you should  Mention that Fez  We're already booked  Thanks for reminding us  Wow you guys are really eager 
[02:38:00]  To have our client  On your show  We can't wait  I have to agree  And so now  Fez feels really bad  About himself  Could you continue  This conversation  With Roland  As Larry Merchant  Please  Roland  It's good  When Danny McBride  First  Broke onto  The comedy scene  No one  Could have thought  That a man  Named Fez  Marie Wadley  Could bring him down  Today  You Roland  Have brought him down  Jim 
[02:38:30]  Okay Jim  I got the fight  Four rounds to three  Roland  Fez  Alright  It's a bad room  I'm trying to find Fez  To see if he's in yet  You want to some more  Nolte  Yes please  He's doing his last  Yeah probably  Tell me  Fez Watley  What's the first thing  That comes to your mind  That's not a word  For the face you just made  Nothing  You don't like him  I don't say that  I don't have nothing  I'll get the real answer 
[02:39:00]  Would you say Fez  Is a friend of yours  I mean the work friend  Not a friend friend  Is Fez a friend of yours  A work friend  Ronnie B and I  Have only seen each other  In this fucking studio  True  That's a friend of mine  Jimmy's never been to my house  I've never been to his house  Jimmy's a friend of mine  I want to come over  I want you to come over too  Consider it done  All my publicist  Jimmy tells my wife  His deepest fucking secrets  Five minutes  I go to the bathroom  I come back  With fucking old girlfriends  You had a nice chat  Yeah I like that  It's like this poor guy  You know when he was seven  There was this thing 
[02:39:30]  With an ironing board  And I'm like whoa whoa  You just let it all out  How'd that happen  People tell her everything  I was probably overtired  But I don't think I said anything to her  That I wouldn't have told other people  No it was all stuck  Within seconds  You're telling her everything  My wife is an odd  There's an odd thing  Where people tell my wife  My mother has that too  People just tell her everything  It's one of those things  I like women who I can just tell anything to  They remind me of mother  You're not going to stick up  For your guy here  No I mean seriously  The thing is beyond like even show stuff 
[02:40:00]  Fez has the heart of fucking gold  He does  And he's having a fucking hard time  Yes  He had three fucking heart attacks  He's got  I asked him to go to my fucking Foxwood show last year  And he burst into tears on the radio  Well you pressured him  You pressured him  That's how he felt  Not really  But last time I called  I realized I was playing Foxwoods  And you're like  Where are you playing  And I go  And I fucking pulled up  With a stand up double  Instead of stretching it up  Then I noticed this  But in the same way  You fucking stay right there  I have to call Ricky's people  So I have to  Rich Voss said he's going to come in  Wait what are you doing? 
[02:40:30]  You have to call Ricky's people  They text me  Wait wait wait wait  This is real  Louis C.K. writes on his Twitter  I'm waiting in the lobby to go on O&A  Roland the Booker is making me wait forever  I'm going home  If he's not here in one minute  Alright go down there Roland  We're supposed to have Louis C.K. today?  Just text me  He's probably with Ricky  I'm guessing he's with Ricky  I'm guessing he's with Ricky  I'm rolling  He really  Look at him  Did you play Mark  The baby elephant right there  When he runs down the hallway  Someone tweet  Fucking Louis C.K.  And tell him to come and get him  I'll just text him  It's getting weird in here 
[02:41:00]  Ronnie  It's getting weird in here  It's a very strange place  Very strange  That's going to be the new tagline  O.P. and Anthony  It gets weird in here  I was trying to  Get him fucking riled up  No  When I saw him come in  That was the  Don't fuck with him face  He really did  He's like a fucking psycho  Yeah  I used to think he was a gay guy  Because when he's doing  All his hand gestures and stuff  And pointing to his butt  And doing his shrugging the shoulders  He to me looks like a gay guy  Am I in left field on it?  Yes  Yes you can't say stuff like that 
[02:41:30]  That's just something  It's just something that's wrong  So wait  If Louis comes up with Ricky  If they come early  We'll just talk him early  But we have to  Yeah  I don't know what the hell  This takes about  You gotta dump out right  No no  We have to  Ricky has to be a replay  We promised  A little business letterman's spot  Can't do that  But we can talk to Louis  But if they're together  We just  You gotta just  Then what happens  I have to piss anyway  Well they're not gonna wait around  For 40 minutes  For us to talk to him  They shouldn't wait at all  No  Yeah  So then they  Explain to Louis  Maybe we should just do it live 
[02:42:00]  And see what happens  The  I mean  Louis won a big  Comedy award  He did  What did he win?  Did he?  Whatever that Comedy Central thing is  Oh good  And here's the thing  I heard there was something  At Comedy Central  He beat Ricky  So there they are together  Buddies  Not for long  And then they make you fucking  You know  Compete against each other  Yeah not for long though  They're not gonna be buddies anymore  Alright  We almost had Roland fucking attacking somebody  I didn't get that vibe at all  Yeah I didn't either  He seemed fucking confused to me 
[02:42:30]  But I haven't seen him go crazy  He seemed like a dizzy prick to me  He's like  You know he  Like he and he said  Dave don't like each other  And Dave doesn't fight with people  And there's a common denominator  Roland  Yeah  You got a fucking producer  That doesn't get along with people  No he's a booker  No he gets along with people  Yeah  Roland is actually really  Really good at his job  I've never in my life  Met anyone's like  I have a fucking problem  With Fez Watley  Like that's like crazy  That's like  I don't like fucking  Miles Davis kind of  Roland is  Is kind of a goofball  But he takes  On our show  But he takes his job 
[02:43:00]  Very seriously  So maybe he feels like  Fez is stepping in his turquoise  How?  I'm just telling you  Charlie Sheen tickets  Well  He took fucking  Is that serious?  That was a bad one  Foo Fighters  That was a bad one  How about that?  Alright that's a bad one too  So what are you talking about?  Why do you have his back so blind?  Foo Fighters are beyond his control  I know what happened  Jimmy knows  Yeah  It's beyond his control  When  Names  Roland has brought guests back to this show  That the company and no one else could do  Like who?  Jimmy?  Yeah he has 
[02:43:30]  Who did he bring back?  He brought that guy  Oh he was good  He was one of my favorites  Until Jay made everything uncomfortable  Fucking Ronnie got way better guests than we did  And then Roland came back  And then we finally got guests too  I don't know how you're doing it  Fez  Fez  It's all Fezzy  See that's what this is about  Yes  That's what this is about  Roland sees the big names on  Well the other thing is  You're on at a ridiculous time in the morning  Yeah  You know  It's crazy 
[02:44:00]  How early it is in here for guests I think  But it gets weird  Like they come in in a whole different vibe  Like Paul Reiser came in  Totally  Different  He came in looking at his shoes too  Yeah  It was very odd  He came in  He probably got him wet by the pool  He's like  He has $20 shoes  He was intimidated  That's right  Meta  Jay  He was intimidated  By whom?  I don't know  Maybe just because it's a bunch of people he didn't know  I know that look  He was intimidated  I'm gonna go pee  Even though he's a big star  Why do you make him feel welcome though? 
[02:44:30]  I don't feel like doing that ever  Jason in Jersey  Jason  Hey I got a question for Jay  Jay  That show that you were on last night  Jay said he had a great time  Andy Cohen  What is it with that guy though?  Is he uh  Of course he is  Is he what?  But he acts like  That one we can say  Of course he is  Is he?  I think most gay guys  Are very into the  The women  Talking about the women  Because it's all about like the fashion  And the Christian Louboutin shoes  Yeah what is that all about?  Like I love your purse  I love your necklace  I think he talks about it perfectly  He talks about it like a gay guy 
[02:45:00]  My wife and I met Rufus Wainwright  And he fucking straight up and down  Mad dogged my wife  Like a straight guy  Yeah  And I looked at my wife  And my wife looked at me like  Did that just really fucking happen?  He goes I love your necklace  And then she goes  Oh thanks  And like we're  You know  It's Rufus Wainwright  Right  To us it's royalty you know  And he just  Then he didn't stop in the necklace  He did the full elevator  Up down and back  But do you think he was like attracted to her  Or just  I think my wife  Could flip  Flip a guy 
[02:45:30]  Guys like that  I don't  You know  Are you still there?  Rufus is pretty deep  Yeah  Go ahead Jason  So what's your question is  Is he a gay person?  Well I just  Just the way he acts  I didn't see his papers  But  You would have to say yes  I would think  You would have to  I don't know the answer to that question  You were hilarious on that show  The only show that he does here is out  Why are you watching it?  You must be a gay person  No  It actually just came on after that show  My wife and I were watching that Real Housewives  And man what a train wreck those women 
[02:46:00]  Jason hold on a second  It was fun as hell that show  We got Liam who's a great booker for SiriusXM  What happened with the Foo Fighters?  Because Roland's not really willing to talk  I asked for the Foo Fighters to do a couple things while they were up here  Including our show  Because it's perfect for our show  It's great for your show  Dave's a great interview  They wanted to do a whole takeover for Alt Nation  And was told that that was the only thing that they were going to do  And then someone on Friday made a phone call to Dave Grohl  And got something else done  Yeah and that's someone I kind of talked about  Without mentioning his name  But alright so that someone gets them on Howard 
[02:46:30]  So why can't  We made the phone call  But why can't he do more shows?  He's sitting in a studio down there  Going track by track through the album  And recording stuff  They gave us an hour of time to do a four day takeover channel  Yeah  I'm sorry Ope  So is he really not taking it over for four days?  He's recording content to take it over  Oh boy you just tore down a wall  People like to think the guy's sitting there for four days  It's supposed to be live  They're supposed to sit here with us for all weekend  Ronnie you like to think the guy's here for four days don't you?  You know what there's a reason they call it show business  That's right  Not just business  Right  Alright you gotta have a little show to this 
[02:47:00]  You just show the business  Yes  And not the show  Right  Yeah  Don't show the business  Don't fucking let the Rubes know  They're not gonna win the big fucking dog  That's the first time I've seen the album too  They just handed it to me  So he's gonna rush through his four days in what an hour?  Yeah and then bolt  It's gonna be an hour Ronnie  Not four days  Yeah okay  But they're gonna spread that hour  They're gonna spread that hour over four days  Wait is that  We got the answer  Is that them in the hallway in the  Where's he now?  They're split between two different studios  Fez is talking to him  Fez is  Fez took him in to do drops in the other room 
[02:47:30]  Whenever I'm in the New York City area  I listen to Ron and Fez  Is that it?  Ron and Fez with a Z?  Does Fez make them do that?  No  No  Isn't that like the most  I'd like to think he does  Yeah  Isn't that the most  It's the worst thing to hear on a radio show  Well did you ever hear that Albert Brooks album  Where he goes and does every radio format?  It's the funniest fucking thing in the world  I can't think of the name 
[02:48:00]  I think it's called A Star Is Bald  And he does the whole album  It's done in studio  And he does  This is what happens when I'll act like I'm doing talk radio  And you can fill this in right?  So one of them he goes  And he's actually going like this  This is Albert Brooks  Whenever I'm in New York  Chicago  Los Angeles  The Two Pines area  He just  So you can pull it  And then he'll do a  You're listening to W  A  B 
[02:48:30]  C  And the whole  You'll be able to fucking make your own drops out of it  That's great  It's fucking the funniest thing that ever happened  You know he's got a book coming out  Really?  Yeah  You'll be interviewing him  I hope so  We certainly won't be  Why not?  Will you get me the interview?  I would like to  Yeah I'm going to get you everything  I'd love to get Albert Brooks  Should we take a break?  Is Louie here?  I don't know  Iraq's saying we've got to take one more break  Before we go  All right let's just take the quick break  And he's begging  I'll make love  And then we'll come back on  Is Louie really here?  I don't  I think Roland's down there getting him  With Ricky? 
[02:49:00]  I don't know  I don't know  Well something's weird  Yeah  Something's really fucking strange  Always weird  Should you know that Louis C.K. was going to be here today?  No  That's the beauty of this show  The Desert Inn has heart  The Desert Inn has heart  That's why we never promote anything  Because we don't know ourselves  You should really tear roll in a new one  For fucking up Louis C.K.  Oh now there's three things Ronnie  See  Now that we got three things  I think you got your own personal thing  No I just wanted something to happen  That doesn't involve me talking 
[02:49:30]  We should break and come back  In case Louie's here  Louie was supposed to be a surprise  So the listeners blew that with their Twitters  If Louie Twittered it  It wasn't a big surprise  How old are we?  Why do we need a surprise?  I love surprises  You wanted the Louie C.K.'s a surprise?  I love the surprises  He's gotten your cake  It's going to be so nice  He's bringing him with a pony  Get on it Opie  Today's your lucky day  Well Louie's coming down the hall now  We really have to take a break  Let's take the break immediately  Just for company purposes  They've got to get their bullshit in  So when we get back  Louie C.K.  Stay there 
[02:50:00]  The Virus  Sirius XM  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie  Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie  Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie  Well  We're coming back on now  Yeah, we're on  Jay Moore is now reliving the Paul Reiser walking into the studio bit  Louie C.K.'s in studio  It's been a very weird morning, Louie  Yeah  And we almost lost Louie C.K. 
[02:50:30]  Because I guess you were supposed to be a surprise for us  Yeah, I didn't know that  I would rather you just know that our friend Louie C.K. is coming in  Yeah, I'm not a person that you surprise somebody with  No, but I think that's Roland covering his ass  Hey, look, it's your mailman  Right  Oh my God!  Because I think he forgot to tell us that you were coming in  So all of a sudden he goes, it's a surprise  And then just to get everyone up to speed  And Louie's in the lobby  And he's tweeting that he's leaving if no one comes and gets him  Because he was there since nine  Because he dropped his kids off  And then he did leave while we went to break 
[02:51:00]  And Roland had to do Heart Attack City to go find you  Yeah, he looked pretty bad when he ran and found me on 7th Avenue  How many blocks away were you?  Just half a block  I knew he was going to come  I was being a complete asshole  That's fine  I knew that if I went half a block away, Roland would have to run  Right  You know, it's not fair because he's extremely efficient whenever I come here  So he sets a high standard  So, like, it's been 17 minutes, I'm like, what the fuck?  And then I get  I shouldn't have Twitter because you shouldn't be able to punch out your big, you know, your sudden thoughts 
[02:51:30]  But that's why Twitter is great  Because I'm a little cunty  Yeah, I know  17 minutes is a long time, though  Five minutes is reasonable  But now that momentary cuntiness is in the Library of Congress  Good, it got action, it should have been there  You should have waited, you should have done it after eight minutes  But it's our fault because we were being up and rolling for another thing  He's having a tough morning  Because it blew me off at the Charlie Sheen lesson  It would have just vibrated like I'm fucking downstairs, right?  Or you could put the guy in the system and then you just walk up, get your fucking pass and come up 
[02:52:00]  Now I'm looking at the cunty tweet  It says, all it says is I'm waiting in the lobby to go on O&A  Roland the Booker is making me wait forever  I'm going home if he's not here in one minute  That's cunty  That's cunty, right?  That's right  That's not right  He has a job, I have a job  You just won a major award  Yeah, a major award  What'd you win? Congratulations  Uh, I won an Oscar for, uh  Oh, see, I thought they were a while ago  I didn't realize you had that  I was the best picture  You're incorrigible  Who'd you beat out?  I don't know, I don't  Oh, uh, you know 
[02:52:30]  Were you even there?  I was there because they told me three weeks ahead of time that I won  That you would win  Otherwise you would never go  Of course  And then the awards show sucks because everybody knew they won like a month before  So no one's like, oh my god  They're like, yeah, so thanks  It was pretty shitty  I didn't watch  It was dumb  I beat out a handful of other comedians  I don't remember who they were  Don't say no more  It was Ricky  Ricky was one of them  And Whitney Cummings was one of them  You beat out Ricky  Yeah  That's gonna mess up your friendship, I'm thinking 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, I don't care about that  No  I'll trade awards for friendship with that guy  Any day  We're gonna talk to Ricky in a little while  So it's not gonna make sense that we only talk to Louie for 10, 15 minutes  But then when we replay the Ricky Gervais interview  Whenever that's gonna be  Then you're gonna hear Louie a little more  Yeah, Louie will be here for the Ricky interview  Right  And for those of you listening now  You'll hear it in a few days  Fucking  Yeah  And I would've been here for 40 minutes  If  Roland's incompetence hadn't bungled again  Roland hadn't fucked everything up once again 
[02:53:30]  Roland's had a tough morning  As he should  Derailing this program  He's gonna come back down here again, man  He's gotta get in shape  I mean, for his own sake  If you run half a block and you look that bad  True  It's very rare, though, that he has to chase down cunty guests  Nick Nolte tried to leave last week  Oh, Christy God  Don't bring that shit up again  It's not a great Nick Nolte  He's working on it  It's so much better than it's sexy cloud  It's like Nick Nolte could sound someday  Three hours later, it's right on  It's been horrible  It's Michael 
[02:54:00]  It's really good  You fuck it with me  No, I'm serious  Thank God Louie showed up  At 6.30, I rolled out Nick Nolte  It was so fucking  And they were shitting on it?  No, it wasn't anywhere close to that  He's been working on it all day  Yeah  It's been a progression all morning  He's got it now  I've done this in my house  Watching Thin Red Lion  When he yells at Stabros  I gotta take the  I gotta stop all my head  Fucking Paul Reiser really fucked this up  That was pretty good  Did you see  Charlie  No one we know went to go see Charlie  Exactly 
[02:54:30]  Why would anyone go?  You went to see him?  No  I was going to  So I could talk about it  Oh, you went  Why not?  He wanted to go  And Roland didn't get his tickets  Because Roland took NyQuil  And fell asleep for 16 hours  At noon  He took DayQuil though  But NyQuil doesn't put you to sleep  Thank you  That's exactly  His lies are falling apart  He looks just like Big A  Who, Roland?  Yeah  That's the whole point  Is it doesn't put you to sleep  Yeah  So his lies are falling apart  I could see going to the show  For research  Yes, you're supposed to do that  I would  I would check it out  But I wouldn't  I wouldn't go thinking 
[02:55:00]  I was going to see a great show  No, no  I wouldn't go thinking  I'm seeing Louis C.K.  You know  The best reason to put Twitter down  Is fucking  You are one tweet away  From losing your job  Well, from losing all  To becoming infamous  Yeah  I mean, from really fucking  Yeah, what's his name?  Gilbert  Yeah  Are you past the Palin stuff?  Because some of your Palin  Yeah, I got past that  I deleted those too  So after a while  Because your Sarah Palin tweets  Could have been your Gilbert Gottfried  Yeah, they could have fucked me up  But I actually think  If I did them now  Like, that's how fast it's changing 
[02:55:30]  Oh, now they're aware  What did you say to Patrice in here?  What did I say to Patrice in here?  About  I'll tell you  Oh, the thing  How they named the thing  The word nigger came from  Because some black guy was  Being a nigger  That's what I said  To Patrice O'Neal  Sorry I had to hear that  I don't care  No, it's okay  The thing with Louie, though  Is if he's on a plane  Your tweets get fucking crazy  Well, because I get  When I'm on a plane  If I drink rum  I go to a different  State of consciousness 
[02:56:00]  That's something they say  Like in the ghetto  Like, no, only when I drink rum  I get a little  No, B and wine  Am I  Rum  Forget it  Rum  Forget about it  Now you drink the rum  Because you're scared to fly?  No, I just  Being on a plane  Is an opportunity to drink  I don't drink any other time  Do you drink to forget Lou  Or to dream greater dreams?  People do things on planes  They don't normally do  You'll never see tomato juice  Anywhere but on a plane  You know, I used to fucking have that  Before  Take an amazing story  Hold on, stop the room 
[02:56:30]  Everybody does tomato juice  All over the world  No, but no one drinks it  You can have a tomato juice right now  But you don't  Gallons of tomato juice  Disappearing every second  To planes  To planes  I drank it because  I'd be in first  And I'd feel like a gentleman  When they'd say  Would you like a beverage  And I would have a tomato juice  And then it just became a habit  Yeah  What?  She's great  What a fucking rump on her  Yeah, she's got a big rump  What's her story?  She's an intern, a producer, what?  I don't know  She's a big juicy  I think we've got to leave her alone  That could get us in trouble  With the HR  I think that's an HR situation  Yeah, you're not allowed 
[02:57:00]  To eat the ass of interns  Frowned on  Jay Severin  Jay Severin  Same exact thing  He said the other day  I fucked my interns  He's gone  That's it  He's done  This radio host out of Boston  Were you there when you were there?  I don't know  Are you kidding me?  No  He fucked him  What a dope  At least he said he did  I mean he said it was a joke  Or maybe serious  You can't fuck with interns  No  Fuck them  They're very sacred  They're sacred people 
[02:57:30]  They're really  They're a sought after commodity  Interns  Word for free  But don't fuck me  What's wrong with him saying he  Maybe he actually did fuck one  Who knows  Then that's  He's just telling the truth  On a talk show  He's so funny  Perfect  It's a great drop  It's a great drop  I don't even have the fucking thing  It was perfect  So the timing of that  Was amazing  That was the timing of Johnny Carson  Yeah  That was like  Johnny used to have a 360  And just hit it all night  We had a nice  You don't want to tell 
[02:58:00]  Any more kids stories?  I loved your kids story  I've been talking for fuck  I talk too much  We all know I talk  There's no secret  I talk too much  I loved your giraffe story  And then he goes  You're fucking with me  We're going to the bathroom  He goes  You're fucking with me  With the giraffe story  It was a great story  Well you also pulled off  Your Twitter right  Why are you so insecure?  Yeah why are you insecure?  Yeah Jay  Why do you  When you get praise  Why do you think  It's somebody trying to hurt you?  It's been a very odd morning  Yeah  A lot of people  Have been getting praise  Not for real  Oh really?  Well I just sat in that chair 
[02:58:30]  For about a half hour  Of the most uncomfortable  Interview you've ever heard  And on his bio  He made him feel like a loser  I don't think he's used to  Being a public person anymore  Is that what it is?  Because we're trying to figure it out  I think he's been a rich  Very rich guy  In a house by himself  I don't know if he has a family  Right  Because Jay says  If you're a comic  You should be able to  I don't know anything about him  I made that point before though  Yeah  But Jay says  If you're a comic  You should be able to  Feel the room  And go with it  If you had  He hasn't been on  He hasn't been on stage  In years and years  He said he didn't understand  For over a decade  And he goes  And then I went out  To Hermosa Beach 
[02:59:00]  And I went on stage  And he points at me  And he goes  And you know  Your comedy muscle gets fat  I'm like  The fuck you point at me?  Like I fucking  Well because he recognizes you  As his comedian  See  Thank you  He's saying hey  You know  You would know  Because you're a comedian  I wanted to say  He was paying you respect  A little respect  You really think he was like  I'm going to get aggressive  With this kid on the radio  No no no  I'm just doing it for a fucking guy  I like you  You piece of shit  I know what you mean  Just take a shot at somebody  You were over there giggling  And fucking with his back to him  But my thing was  If you're a fucking comic 
[02:59:30]  And you for fucking 10 years  If you go up on stage  If Louis doesn't go on stage  For 10 years  And you put him up on the cellar  You wake him up  And say go  Just go fucking talk to people  He's going to be fucking hilarious  I disagree  I don't  Sorry  If I take a few weeks off  I get a little nervy  I don't want to go on  Yeah  Yeah but maybe the audience  Doesn't notice that  If I don't go on stage for a while  I start having nightmares  About bombing  Really?  Yeah  Like bad nightmares  Wow  Where I'm on stage  In front of a huge crowd  And I'm just going  Like I can't get it out 
[03:00:00]  And people are starting to go  Oh fuck  Like it's getting ugly  Is it always the same room?  It's different  Sometimes it's an outdoor thing  Because those  You can't control outdoor  Yeah  And they're typically  Good comedy venues  Yeah  Yeah  Wonderful  Yeah exactly  Comedy doesn't need a roof  Let it breathe  Like the same way  With the Grateful Dead  It's easier for people  It can stretch out a little bit  Let it breathe  You can bring blankets  Nice setup  Oh thank you 
[03:00:30]  I do blame Jay Moore  For the Paul Reiser thing  Going bad  Because he did the half slice thing  Alright we were talking about  I'm bringing this up  Because maybe  When we started the show  Jimmy was talking about  He had pizza last night  With Colin  And it was the first time  Jimmy had pizza in years  And Jimmy like  Very childlike  And wonderful  And boozy  As he goes  Pizza's fucking delicious  Like it was amazing  It's been a while  Since I've had it  It was the purest  Like I wasn't teasing him  It was amazing  How funny it was  I said pizza fucking rules  Pizza fucking rules  Pizza fucking rules 
[03:01:00]  Yeah  And then I said  We were talking about  There's no good pizza  In Manhattan  And then I said  You know Chelsea  Something about Chelsea  And then Ronnie  Did something about  A gay guy  Ordering pizza  Did you have a half slice  And that's the new  Thing that we're trying  To get to take off  Yeah  Half slice  But just something  About a gay guy  Ordering a half slice  That's so funny  Why is that funny  I don't know  Because they love  The whole time  Why would he order  Half a slice  But somehow  Totally  I believe it is  Like a trope 
[03:01:30]  That's been around  For years  To keep his washboard  Stomach  It makes sense  Because he's gay  A half slicer  Like yeah  We just don't know why  Can I have a half slice  And I pictured like  Five like  Beautifully dressed  Like gay guys  And like they're  Mulling around  And I go  Yeah it's gonna happen  Who was that  And the guy going  Oh  You have half slices  Like  They gotta figure out  How to go in  How to go in  On half slices  So Louie knows exactly  Why I was laughing at that  Paul Reiser sits down  He goes  So how's everybody doing  And I go  And I just look at Paul Reiser  And I go  Yeah half half slices  Here's the thing 
[03:02:00]  I start laughing so hard  It's like  I don't know if you've ever done  And he doesn't know  Why you're doing it  Right  Exactly  Now here's the thing  With Louie  You showed him the respect  You told him the back story  Right  And now he's part of it  That's exactly it  So Louie and I  There's like a trench  You blindsided him  Right  With the half slice thing  With the half slice thing  Right  And you know what it's like  He didn't know  And like  You know  Okay  When you walk in  To a radio place  Are you gonna let anybody else  Say fucking anything  I know I have a problem  I've been talking  I know  I'm sorry 
[03:02:30]  You walk in now  It's too quiet  No it's good  You stood your ground  Now you  You're not gonna take anymore  See  The weirdness takes over everybody  See what happened there  Right  This is an aggressive room  Wow  You've been on radio shows  Where you walk in  And something's been going on  You don't know what it is  Yes  And if some young guy  Takes a shot at you  You're like  What the fuck is this place  And yet  He paid you a respect  By throwing you a  Hey you know what it's like  You're a pro  About the Hermosa Beach thing  That still wasn't enough  And you're still like 
[03:03:00]  Oh what does he mean  It's because you live  Moment to moment  You're like a dog  You live moment to moment  You don't give anybody  Any credibility  And you don't take any  Responsibility for your own actions  You just live moment to moment  You don't like an energy  You respond  That's it  I take full responsibility  For my actions  Well I  It's easy to just say that out loud  You live like a dog  You don't actually do it  But it is true  You have no past or future  You don't care about it  That's how dogs experience life  And E-Rock just told me  We have eight minutes  Eight minutes for what 
[03:03:30]  What the fuck  Because we've got to do  The Ricky Gervais thing  Right at ten  Great excellent  Because people get to bitch  When we don't go past ten  Which is a perfect day  To go past ten  But we can't  They'll hear more of this  Fucking fantastic  Fucking  Some kind of dogs  Later on this week  Yeah  Did I miss anything  What kind of dog  All dogs are  What do you mean  What kind of dog  He wants to know  What kind of dog  He lives on  There isn't a vast  Difference in brain structure  Between a fucking shepherd  Although with Cox  There certainly is a difference  Everyone look around the room  Like what kind of dog  Is each guy  Stop  Yeah  We don't want to do it 
[03:04:00]  What is this  Don't make us do that  That's fucking high talk  You've been doing  Too many morning zoo shows  Driving to a fucking gig  What's wrong with you  That's right  I like the half slice thing though  Because it's like  They have to get slices and pairs  Right  Like can I do half slices  Can I do half slices  Will you go in with me  Because he won't give me a half  He's going with a half slice  And the Greek pizza guy  Hates when they fucking come in  I get stuck with a half slice  Come in with your faggot friend  I'll give you each and half slice  Don't make me give you one  Malak I can meet you  With a half slice  We haven't talked to Louis 
[03:04:30]  Since the  Thank you for reminding me  The Rumsfeld thing  Blizzard  Oh that's right  That fucking thing took off  Uncomfortable  That really blew up  Another uncomfortable day  That I really enjoyed  I think you were losing Anthony  That was really fun  Because Anthony wanted  The real interview with Donald  He wanted to be friends with him  Yes he did  He really did didn't he  Because he was doing  A beautiful job  I think that's fair enough to say  Of straight manning the thing  He did a great interview  But also he was facilitating me  Because he kept him from hanging up  He got me  Right  To the place you needed to  Ten shots  To answer that  To ask that question 
[03:05:00]  So you left us  And then that  That video goes viral  Do you get any feedback from that?  Well I get both  I get some people  That loved it  I want to kill you right  And I get  Oh all kinds of angry  You know  You fucking  Unpatriotic piece of shit  That man  You know  Like they act like  He fought all the wars  That he planned  Like he was there  Just trying to have fun with him  Yeah  Just having a good time  Make a little different for him  He had the most amazing  Non-answers  Of anyone I've ever seen  Interviewed ever  Like in press conference  Oh yeah  At a podium I mean 
[03:05:30]  Like the most fascinating  He's the best at that  Yeah  Ronny you heard this right?  Yeah  Even the fact that day  That he didn't freak out  Or get pissed  Or hung up  I mean that's  He's like such a pro  It's because he's  An in control  Lizard person  He doesn't  He could destroy the planet  At any second  He's here just as  Amusement  But he could take us all out  That was an amazing day  Are you a lizard?  That was really fun  Animated by CokeLogic  So if you follow CokeLogic  On Twitter  I'm sure he'll tweet the link 
[03:06:00]  For everybody today  What else you been up to?  You filming the show?  Second season?  Yeah second season  Is it going well?  Yeah except for  I'm running out of shit  To shoot  I'm writing it myself  So after next week  I got nothing  Because I can't write  Right now  Like I'm not coming up  With any shit  Go with half slice  It's good right?  It is yours  Good good  We're going to give him  Half slice Ryan  Just like that  And then  Here's the thing too  Is like you have  Half slice  No  You got a quarter  And then that'll be  Boom  Fade to black  You have a quarter  And then we're done  Write it to Louie Louie 
[03:06:30]  Louie just ate  He doesn't want a full slice  Maybe the guy can  Hook him up with a half slice  Because I'm really not that hungry  But I don't want to be rude  And not eat  So how many episodes  Short are you going to be  If you don't start writing?  Well I just don't have  I mean I've shot about seven  About a half  A little over half  But it's just  We have nothing  We have a crew  And you know  It costs us like  90,000 bucks a week  Just to exist  As a company  You're doing this  Like we do our radio show  You're just making it up  As you go along?  Yeah I'm not supposed to 
[03:07:00]  But that's kind of  The way it's working out  Louie has the greatest  I backlogged a lot of material  But it melts quick  It's like when you  Have a plan  A snowball fight  Yeah  When you're a kid  And you make a thousand snowballs  Yeah  And they're gone  In like two seconds  After a while  You're just grabbing snow  And fucking throwing it  Rocks  You go to the rocks and sticks  That's where I'm at now  You seem to have a great gift  Of autonomy  You just are able to do the show  Autonomously  Yeah nobody tells me  I mean I write this stuff  And I give it to the producer  And we start  It doesn't exist anywhere else 
[03:07:30]  But it's hard  Because like I wrote something  Last night  Because I need shit  Holy shit  And I think it's good  But I don't know  And there's nobody  To check with  So I can email it  To my producer  And we'll be shooting it  Next week  But it might stink  We could be filters for you  Want to do it?  Well yeah  But we're on the radio  I know  Oh you mean  Off mic maybe  See what we think  Half slice  Yeah I can't  I can't  Were you really happy  With the first season  Because I thought  It was fucking amazing  I thought it was amazing  Thank you  Absolutely  I loved it 
[03:08:00]  But I got it  I have to  It has to be better now  It has to be  It's only  Sophomore James  You're thinking  Well I just think  You have to  Is that scary  You have to improve  For a second season  You have to  You've been writing  For so many years  Oh man  You know how to  You know how to  Not run out of ideas  You've been writing  For 30 years  Yeah but they run out sometimes  Oh not with you  They don't  You'll be fine  He's got a script  He's always got a brilliant idea  Always  I don't know  How is  We're going to talk to Ricky  In about 3 minutes  We have to leave unfortunately  You're going to hear 
[03:08:30]  The second half of this  Sometime this week  It's getting weird  If you're lucky  If you're lucky  But how was the new  Ricky Gervais show  You were on the first episode  Right  Yeah I think it's just  The one  I don't think it's a series  Is it  I thought it was  I don't know  I don't think they're doing  More than just the one  I've seen it  And I know what they showed  What's that  Why did he stop doing extras  He was done  He only does 12 and done  Yeah but is  The Ricky Gervais show  The animation  Isn't that third season now  Yes  Yeah that's going a while  But where he has to be  On camera it seems  Like the original office  Was fucking 13 
[03:09:00]  If you include the final  And so is extras  And it was gone  Yeah  Is Ricky coming back  To the office  I know he's doing  I have no idea  I don't know  Let's look in your eyes  But  I don't know anything  No I don't  We want a big scoop  But no the thing  With Jerry and Chris  Was amazing  It was you  Jerry and Chris Rock  Yeah and Ricky  And Ricky was kind of  Leading the discussion  Yeah  And what  You guys were just  Talking about comedy  For five hours  We just sat  And talked about comedy  And then they cut it  To an hour  To an hour  Holy shit  And it was intense 
[03:09:30]  It was really fun  It was interesting  And normally for me  To watch comics  Yeah it makes you puke  Talking about comedy  There's always one  Who's going to wax  Philosophically  You don't want to spit  In his face  But that was  It was really good  That's the way  To do it though  Five hours  Cut it down  To an hour  Jerry and Chris  Have something in common  That they love comedy  I feel the same way  Like we love talking  About it  And we all  Just love  It's  You know  I remember  Every comedian  I've ever seen  I remember everybody's bits  Top five  Comedians 
[03:10:00]  Nonetheless  Now who was  One of your guys  When you were growing up  Bill Cosby  Was one of my favorites  Storyteller  Yeah  And Steve Martin  Really  I loved  Yeah  Why Steve  Just he came out  And left fields  No I'm just asking  I'm asking Louie though  There could be more  To it  Some people  Some people forget that  Steve Martin was an amazing comic  And filling out  Filling out arenas  So I'm asking  Very original  It's funny to listen now  Because it's not  It really was like  The context  That the standups  Were doing like stories 
[03:10:30]  Or like George Carlin  Guys like that  Love Carlin  And then Steve Martin  Just acted like  A fucking goof  He was just weird  And I know  What Louie's saying  Is that when the gong  Would start for that song  All of our comedy blood  Just kind of got  Floor  Here's the thing  With Steve Martin  That was so like  Amazing  Is like  He made fun  Of being fucking funny  Like he made fun  Of the fact  That you were even  At his show  It made the whole  Fucking thing  Feel nuts  But are you sure  That's what's happening  Or was he really  Not that funny 
[03:11:00]  No  People just on Quaaludes  Laughing at a guy  With an arrow  He was  It's like Peter Frampton now  You look back and go  What the fuck  Was everyone so excited about  I think he was better  At comedy than Peter Frampton  We have ten seconds  And this fucking show  Is going to cut off  Louis C.K. is a great comedian  It's just going to end like that  Why does it have to end like that  Why can't we just talk  And stop it  Why does it have to end like that  E-Rock  Why  And that day  We'll be at Anthony's show  On the virus  Sirius XM  We'll be at Anthony's show </pre>
