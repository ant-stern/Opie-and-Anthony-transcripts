<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a detailed recounting of the hosts' experience at Sam Roberts' wedding in Connecticut.  They described the charming but quirky Main Street, the sweltering heat in the barn reception due to a malfunctioning air conditioning system, and the resulting discomfort.  The wedding itself was described as positive, with praise for the bride's vows and the groom's father's officiating.  Humorous anecdotes included a guest's enthusiastic (and awkward) dancing, another guest's unusually large head, a DJ who seemed to be a fan of the show, a bartender who refused to serve Anthony a drink, and a catering hall tip scandal.  Attendees from their group included Kenny, Jimmy, E-Rock, and Roland.  Post-wedding activities included a visit to Pepe's Pizza, and E-Rock's graphic story of soiling himself at the hotel was shared.  The segment concluded with a preview of upcoming guests: Paul Williams (with mention of a past phone call incident), Uriah Faber, and Anthony Bourdain, followed by a story about Jim Florentine's childhood encounter with a potentially predatory man.

The show then launched into a critical review of the 2012 MTV Movie Awards, particularly Russell Brand's hosting performance, which they deemed underwhelming and reliant on cheap jokes targeting "Twilight" and "Hunger Games."  They also discussed Justin Bieber assaulting a paparazzo (deemed "edgy"), Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's relationship (with speculation about a future sex tape), and several upcoming film releases.  A lengthy discussion followed about Adam Sandler's *That's My Boy*, focusing on its R-rated trailer and premise,  along with critiques of Sandler's comedic style and recurring wealthy character portrayals. Andy Samberg's involvement was noted, along with his upcoming appearance on the show.  Other films discussed included *Prometheus*, *Ted*, *Total Recall*, and *The Avengers*.  The hosts mentioned recent celebrity deaths, specifically Richard Dawson, and a viral video featuring "The Trelolo Man."  A harsh critique of Jason Alexander's comments about cricket, along with speculation about his preemptive apology, followed.  The segment ended with graphic descriptions and discussion of the Miami "face-eating" incident, including 911 calls, and an explicit audio clip of two men engaging in sexual activity.  Anthony Bourdain, Paul Williams, and Uriah Faber were again announced as upcoming guests.

An interview with Anthony Bourdain followed.  Bourdain discussed his move from the Travel Channel to CNN, emphasizing CNN's acceptance of the show's style, even after being shown some of its most "messed up" episodes. He detailed his plans for future filming locations, including Libya and the Congo River, and shared anecdotes about the dangers of his work, including severe food poisoning.  He voiced strong opposition to Mayor Bloomberg's large sugary drink ban on libertarian grounds, leading to a discussion about obesity and government intervention.  Bourdain promoted his new graphic novel, "Get Jiro," describing its violent content, and discussed his creative process and his history as a comic book collector.  He also promoted "An Evening with Anthony Bourdain" in Brooklyn. The conversation concluded with a discussion of the Miami cannibalism case and Bourdain's experiences with various psychedelic drugs. The segment closed with the hosts reading listener-submitted "F.U." messages and a brief appearance by Paul Williams promoting his documentary, "Still Alive."

The next segment featured an interview with Paul Williams.  He discussed his career, struggles with addiction and recovery, his work as a drug and alcohol counselor, his difficult childhood, the death of his father, and his strained relationship with his brother. He promoted his documentary, "Paul Williams Still Alive," detailing his life, including his struggles with addiction and multiple marriages, and his current happiness with his wife, Mariana Escalante Williams.  The hosts apologized for a past interaction where they abruptly ended a call with him.  Jim Norton then joined, making crude jokes about erectile dysfunction and infidelity, and promoting AshleyMadison.com.  A musical interlude about alcohol preceded the introduction of Uriah Faber.

Uriah Faber's interview began with a discussion of his sister's severe car accident and recovery. He shared anecdotes about his childhood, his protective nature towards his sister, and his experiences with street fighting in Indonesia.  He discussed his upcoming fight, views on trash-talking, and his relationship with Anderson Silva and Chael Sonnen, including Sonnen's use of testosterone replacement therapy. He promoted his book, "Laws of the Ring."

A subsequent segment focused on Faber's fighting career, specifically his brutal leg injury against Jose Aldo. He described the pain and discoloration, confirming he would fight Aldo again.  The discussion expanded to include the pain of various MMA blows, unspoken rules of engagement, and examples of fighters licking blood during fights (mentioning BJ Penn).  He also discussed concerns about infections from the fight mat.  A Marine Corps fan called in with gifts from the Dominican Republic.  The segment concluded with plugs for Faber's book, upcoming fight, and other Opie and Anthony appearances.  A significant portion then focused on Sam Roberts' extensive collection of professional wrestling action figures,  including damage sustained in a recent earthquake, and a detailed discussion of their value and rarity.

The final segment focused on the value of collectible wrestling action figures, contrasting the low value of mass-produced figures from around 1989 with other collectibles like baseball cards.  The hosts questioned the existence of truly valuable, non-mass-produced wrestling memorabilia, suggesting ring-used gear might be more lucrative.  They expressed surprise at the lack of extremely valuable wrestling action figures, contrasting this with the value some baseball cards achieved. No guests were present, though the hosts attempted to connect with a caller knowledgeable about collectible wrestling items.  The discussion included vulgar language.

[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Good morning. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning.  Oh yeah, that was Monday.  We're up to get up in the morning, you know?  Yeah.  Get into weekend mode.  We're, uh...  We all sleep late.  I guess.  I do.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  Well, hi.  Last time we saw you guys, we're all at a wedding.  I know.  I'm on the heels of the Roberts wedding.  Ooh.  The Sam Roberts wedding.  Where were we? 
[00:05:30]  I guess we could say now, huh?  Yes.  It's a shithouse, Connecticut.  Yes.  It's a shithouse, Connecticut.  Yes.  It's a shithouse, Connecticut.  What a weird fucking Main Street they got.  Anybody walk around?  Oh no, you guys kind of came in.  That way we just winged in and winged out.  I had to be there Friday for a rehearsal dinner.  Oh.  And, uh, so I had some time to kill.  Yeah.  And that Main Street is a weird place.  Yeah, and that really, uh...  It's like, they're trying to go for a, like a, like a, like a hip vibe, like almost hippie-ish. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, please.  Like a little...  A little chic-ish.  Yeah.  And then you got fucking crackheads walking around.  Oh yeah?  I miss those.  And they're mingling with each other.  Really strange.  Uh, I didn't see much of anything.  No, because you guys, uh, came in.  Yeah, we, we...  You were up there for what?  Maybe a total of five hours?  Uh, yeah, probably around there.  What time did we get in?  We got in at literally, uh, five, not five, but 4.30.  4.30. 
[00:06:30]  Wedding started at 5.  Left at 10.  Five and a half hours.  Or 10.30.  Tell you about 10.  Yeah, that's about it.  About 10.  And then, uh...  We did it.  And then out.  And out.  Fuck out.  Back, uh, back to New York.  It was, uh, before we, you know, make fun of some elements, I do, I do want to say  it was, uh, one of the nicer weddings I've been to.  Oh, it was a blast.  I don't, I don't, I don't really like going to weddings.  Yeah.  I don't know if I've said this on the air, because they're all the same fucking wedding.  Well, they are.  I like those weddings where they just, uh, have a little, little twist, a little, something 
[00:07:00]  a little different.  Yeah.  And they had a reception in a barn, so you didn't feel like you were in a wedding hall.  I like that.  It was, uh, it was, yeah, a barn.  I liked it, though.  This place called The Barn.  Although the AC was out of fucking control.  They had, apparently, one unit upstairs, like, up in the second level of the barn.  Right.  And, uh.  In the rafters.  Yeah, in the rafters.  No, this was a real barn.  Right.  Just blowing as hard as it could.  On our table.  If you were in the way of that stream, uh, it was getting a little chilly.  Well, we were. 
[00:07:30]  Our table was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Kenny was, uh, raising, holy hell, trying to get them to turn that.  It was freezing.  It was fucking freezing.  I felt like a little girl.  Of course it was freezing.  I couldn't handle it.  I couldn't handle the fucking AC.  The women from the table kept getting up and going to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Because they said it was warmer there because you walked in under the ledge.  Yeah.  Right.  So that, that, you didn't have that fucking thing blowing on you.  It was awful.  We were all, uh, taking off our fucking suit jackets to warm up ladies.  Suit jackets.  To warm up the ladies.  And the, um, the, uh, the, the, the dais for the bride and groom was right behind us. 
[00:08:00]  So they must have been getting hit with the same thing.  But they weren't even sitting there, really.  No, they were mingling.  They were mingling, mingling about the new Roberts couple.  Right.  Yes.  The brand new Mr. and Mrs. Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Boy, did she settle.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  What a fucking, uh, talk about out of his league.  She, uh, was beautiful.  Yeah.  Absolutely beautiful.  Really, really fucking unbelievably attractive in her wedding dress. 
[00:08:30]  And, and, and, and she, uh, she read off her vows up there.  And, um, it was, she did an amazing job.  Yeah.  Sam does it for a living.  And, and she kicked his ass.  She blew him away.  I can't wait to tell Sam that when he gets back.  She kicked his ass.  Kicked his ass.  He did okay.  Yeah.  He did okay.  But she had a thing.  Yeah.  She had like a, like it was a ticker tape.  Yeah.  A little scroll.  Like ticker tape.  That was white.  So she was kind of reading off that or referring to that.  Yeah.  Referencing that, I should say. 
[00:09:00]  It wasn't distracting.  Like she's holding a piece of paper.  Right.  And then it kind of was falling to the floor, but it looked like it was kind of part of her  dress.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool.  And she made up all those words herself.  Words.  Stupid getting fucking teary eyeballed at that thing.  I really did.  I don't fucking admit it.  God, she, she fucking hit it out of the park.  Quit her vows.  Kenny's great with the, with the emotion and stuff.  Because when the, when Jess's best friend got up and she gave a speech, right from the 
[00:09:30]  get-go, Kenny goes, how long is this going to take?  But he, he said it loud enough where like at least three tables were.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a little, uh, choked up when Jess, yeah, because, uh, it was nice.  I, Sam said he was, I was like, you're about to cry, right?  He goes, yeah.  Cause she, he, I didn't know that she came out to some song he really liked, some dumb  beach boy song, but I didn't, I didn't know the song.  This was the song.  What's the song, Eric?  God only knows what I'd do without you. 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  She walked up the aisle to this.  Oh, right.  Instead of the famous wedding song we've all heard a million fucking times.  Very groovy.  And who knew that Sam liked this song?  I may not always tell you.  Oh, I know this song.  Of course.  But long as there are stars above me.  Ah, look, I feel like I'm sitting there again.  You never need to tell you.  You know who we need to talk to?  Stinky has no emotion.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, like, I mean, the vows are pretty, pretty intense. 
[00:10:30]  I mean, some, a lot of people getting teared, you know, teared up and shit.  Yeah.  Or others just sat there like, whatever, this has nothing to do with me.  Yeah.  But the one emotion that wasn't around except for a couple people was out and out laughter.  And one of those people was stinky in the back row.  Stinky was just laughing.  He was laughing, that fucking pothead.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was probably stoned.  He was just cracking up.  He couldn't handle it.  He couldn't handle it.  There might be some deep emotion going on for a few minutes. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  That cracked me up, though.  Oh, this is, yeah, this is the song she walked up to.  And then, of course, Mr. Roberts, the senior Mr. Roberts.  The father.  The entertainer himself.  The entertainer.  He likes being up on the stage.  Oh, does he love attention, that guy?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  He has such good hair, I thought he had a wig.  I thought it was a rug.  Yeah.  He has such a thick, good head of hair.  He just has those jeans.  He has way too much hair.  Yeah.  And he's an older gentleman because he had his kids later in life. 
[00:11:30]  He's an older gentleman with all his hair still.  Way too much fucking hair.  Yeah.  But he did the ceremony.  Yeah, he did the whole ceremony right there.  Apparently anybody can do that as long as there's a justice or the peace at the end of the whole thing to sign off on.  Really?  Yeah.  Where was that guy?  He just had to be sitting somewhere.  Was he there?  I guess.  And then he signed all the paperwork afterwards.  What, he just has to be a witness?  Yeah, I guess so. 
[00:12:00]  That's how that works.  And then Sam's dad has to pull out the fact that 44 years ago his father married him.  Well, it must be nice to be part of a family tradition.  Are you part of any family tradition?  Yes.  Drinking.  There you go.  Yeah.  Sleep apnea.  My father has it and I haven't.  He goes, 44 years ago, my father married me and my lovely bride.  And I'm honored to do the same here today.  Doesn't he feel like he should have left on a hot air balloon after the ceremony? 
[00:12:30]  You know what I mean?  He's just like an old school coming to town entertainer.  Very oldie time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam's dad is very oldie time.  Really nice guy, though.  He was very good, though.  He didn't over-talk.  No.  Talked very briefly.  Did a great ceremony.  I like a quick fucking ceremony.  Don't piss me off with a long mask churchy thing.  Right.  Oh, my God.  I'll show up for the reception if I know that's happening.  And all the assholes on Twitter were really happy that it was raining all day because they 
[00:13:00]  knew they were trying to get married outside.  But in the end, for some fucking odd reason, it decided to clear up just in time for the  ceremony.  Creepy shit.  Yeah.  And then it started raining afterwards when we were all in the barn.  Yeah.  In the barn.  Freezing our asses off.  A real barn burner.  With a DJ that might be a fan of our show.  Oh, yes.  I'm sure he's listening right now.  Yes.  I appreciate that you like the show, but let's relax a little bit. 
[00:13:30]  We don't need to hear show references all day long.  I went up to the, I was going up to the bathroom and you got to pass by him when you go to  the bathroom.  Yeah.  And he goes, I just wanted to ask you, have I done anything that is giving you douche chills  tonight?  And I just looked at him like, this fucking very moment, you know, asking that question.  He was very excited because I had to borrow a tie from him.  Oh.  Yeah.  How do you have to borrow it?  You're going to a wedding.  Dude, I fucking, I was more than prepared. 
[00:14:00]  I had, I had, I had three different shirts.  I had a suit.  I had belts.  I had shoes.  And I even saw the tie in my closet when I was packing.  The tie.  I don't know where the tie went.  You have one tie?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Why do you laugh?  Because you're grown up in so many ways, but there are others that.  Why would you need more than one tie?  Because.  I don't go to tie events.  But you did.  Yeah.  Occasionally you go to a tie event. 
[00:14:30]  I don't go to tie events very much, but it's just a, you got to have like a couple of  nice suits and a few ties.  A couple different shirts that go in my suit.  Some other suit.  There's like.  There's like.  But the one tie matches all the shirts I got.  There's kind of a good mood suit and then there's like a funeral suit.  No, they're all the same.  They're all the same suit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because the dead guy doesn't care what color you wear.  You don't give a fuck.  All right.  You don't care.  I don't like suits.  I don't either. 
[00:15:00]  I hate them, but you know, you got to wear them.  I got one really nice tie.  Really nice.  Yeah.  And I forgot it.  And I left it at home.  So the DJ, he got all excited that he could do something for me.  Oh.  So he went to his car and he literally had 50 ties in his car.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Did he let you keep it?  He wanted me to keep it.  I'm like, no.  Keep the tie.  I'm like, here, here's your tie back.  Yeah.  I go, you can put it on eBay.  You probably will get about seven bucks for it.  Oh.  Because I wore it.  Seven dollars, maybe.  At the Roberts wedding by Greg Opie Hughes. 
[00:15:30]  And then the DJ couldn't help himself.  Just before the lovely couple were making their way into the barn for the first time,  the guy wished little Jimmy a very happy birthday.  That's how he started.  Yeah, that was the first thing he said, pretty much.  I looked at Jimmy and he even was like, we're assholes and all, but Jesus.  Well, I took a wave to the crowd.  You did wave.  Half of them were like, what does that even mean?  Oh, boy. 
[00:16:00]  It was important.  Well, it was, there were some very typical parts of the wedding where, you know, it just  happens.  I am a people watcher at the wedding.  And boy, were there some things to watch at the Roberts wedding.  Every wedding there is.  Every wedding, there's a bunch of people you can make fun of.  Yeah.  The older broads that try to do the sexy dance is just, I was beyond me. 
[00:16:30]  They're sexy in their own minds still.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, they are.  But there, there was a couple of women dancing there that night.  One in particular.  Oh, my God.  We'll call them Monster and Sir.  Oh, God.  This show got too popular. 
[00:17:00]  They're all listening right now.  I remember the days we could do this break and, you know, no one fucking listened to our  show after going to a wedding.  They're all listening right now.  I just think Danny's got a video rolling of some horrendous dancer at a wedding, girl  dancing at a wedding.  She'll be going down soon.  Oh, she takes a fucking dive.  Oh, I'm sure.  She falls.  She's got to fall.  Yeah.  Oh, she's all hammered.  Oh, there she goes. 
[00:17:30]  Right on her ass.  She's wearing panties?  Barely.  I don't know what the fuck's going on there.  Barely.  Yeah.  Well, this woman was dancing and doing her sexy dance and making sexy faces while she's  dancing.  And she's wearing like a white kind of dress, little short thing, and sticking her ass  out, looking over her shoulder, putting her fists on her hips, her fists on her hips,  and shaking her ass, and making a dancey, sexy face.  Almost doing like a Mick Jagger. 
[00:18:00]  Remember when Mick Jagger used to do that?  Yes, yes.  It almost looks like a chicken.  Speaking of Mick Jagger, Jimmy, Jimmy turns me, he goes, hey, I want to, I want to go  later on, I want to talk to Charlie Watts.  She looked exactly like Charlie Watts.  Charlie Watts.  Can you put Charlie Watts on her?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Horrendous.  It was Charlie Watts, Dr. Zachary Smith. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  She looked like Dr. Smith.  Oh, dear.  Oh, my God.  Yes, it's Charlie Watts.  Oh, my God.  And the whole sexy dancing thing was really getting me.  And then Jimmy decided to point out her calves.  The same woman?  Yes.  Oh, were they big?  They were big calves.  I wasn't sure if she used to be a man.  For real.  I don't know.  She had calves like a man?  Absolutely.  Yeah, she did.  A man's legs. 
[00:19:00]  She had man calves.  Yeah, and she, there was some sculpturing going on in her face that was suspicious.  Jimmy pointed out that she had, she was all happy because she made the covers of, the cover of  calves monthly.  I was just cracking up thinking how awful that magazine would be.  Yeah.  Calves monthly.  What a low sub rate that must have.  Yes.  Jimmy had some lines where I couldn't catch my breath.  Oh.  And then because I was laughing so fucking hard, Jimmy started laughing so fucking hard.  Yes, you have those, like, that upside down calf V thing. 
[00:19:30]  It looks like a heart, the upside down Valentine's Day heart.  Yes.  Yes.  That's a lot of working out.  It really is, right?  I think so.  I think that's a lot of running.  No, wait.  Biking.  No, what?  Anything with legs.  I don't know what that is.  Running, biking, walking.  Biking makes your fucking thighs big.  Oh my God, look at those.  Whatever.  Oh God, look at these women.  Oh, what the fuck is that?  What does she do to herself?  Cavs dot com, I guess.  What site is this?  It's calvesmonthly.com. 
[00:20:00]  That's nice.  Oh my God.  That's a nice calf.  I like a woman with a good calf.  A good calf.  Yeah.  The other line you did.  The other woman with the big head face.  We're awful.  We all looked at her.  Oh yeah, yeah.  And we just knew.  She was the one that we dubbed Samantha from Sex and the City.  Oh really?  Oh yeah.  But Jimmy goes.  She was going after the only two black guys on the dance floor.  Oh boy, was she?  Oh yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Oh yeah.  Oh well.  Ah.  But Jimmy walks up to me and goes, have you seen Giant Face yet?  And I knew exactly who he was talking about.  Exactly.  That's how big her face was.  I couldn't.  I couldn't catch my breath.  I started laughing so fucking hard.  When you say, who's Giant Face, and everybody knows, oh yeah, that's the one.  Exactly who you're talking about.  And then Jimmy was giving me Giant Face scenarios.  Because she was dancing on the dance floor. 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  I'm not going to be able to do it justice.  It was something about that her face gives a forced perspective.  So she had to keep telling her dance partner.  It was like, you don't have to keep back.  I'm not getting closer.  It's just the illusion my face gives.  Like she would lean in and whisper that.  Because she had that giant head.  And so it looked like everyone danced with it, backed up a little.  She was a classic that lady.  Everyone thought she was getting right in their face.  But it's like, no, it just looks that way.  It's an illusion.  It's like that trick in your rearview mirror.  That's all it is.  I'm here.  I'm okay.  She's a big lady. 
[00:21:30]  God, I was dying to tweet and make videos.  But we had to show some respect, unfortunately.  Yeah.  I tweeted a couple of things.  Yeah, little things we were able to do.  He said Dave.  Obviously, but, you know.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  And you guys met Bobby for the first time.  Yes.  I didn't realize it was the first time I met her, though.  Who's a star on this radio show, Sam's Mom.  I really thought I had met her before.  I would have sworn to you that I had met Sam's mother.  I'm like, I knew what she looked like.  I'm like, yeah, yeah.  I've met her before.  She's really nice. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  First time I met her was this weekend.  Yeah.  What a nice woman, though.  Comes up.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, thank you so much for coming.  It's like, what?  I fucking wing in, I wing out.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, I'll skin off my ass.  Oh, God.  It was fun.  It was a good time.  Definitely.  I think it was all right.  Yeah.  That fucking bartender pissed me off.  Why?  I go up there, and I ask for a couple of drinks.  And, you know, you're only allowed two drinks, which is fine. 
[00:22:30]  You know.  But then at the last minute, Jimmy kind of leans over, and he's like,  Anthony, could you get me a Diet Coke?  I didn't realize there was a line, and he was in the front line.  I already had two drinks.  And it was a long line at that point.  So I was like, oh, can I get a Diet Coke also?  And he's looking over my head, not even acknowledging me, going, yeah,  yeah, you, come here, come up here, come up here.  Like, don't even bother talking to me.  I was like, hello, Diet Coke?  It's not like I'm getting three drinks.  Jimmy's right there and stuff.  The other guy got it, though. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, the other guy.  Really?  What was that about?  So I'm just like, fuck it.  Well, it was about him not getting fucking tipped.  That's what it was about.  Bastard.  What a dummy.  It's like he blew off the biggest tipper in the place.  What a dope.  He's an asshole.  What a dope.  Good for him.  Fuck off.  I tipped the other guy great, too.  His partner.  Well, they probably split the tips.  Yeah, probably split them.  God damn it.  Yeah.  Of course.  Or they just, from what I hear in this scandal that's going on, a lot of these catering halls,  they collect the tips from the staff and they just pay them their wage. 
[00:23:30]  And actually, the venue keeps the tips.  What?  Yeah.  There's a class action suit going on with some fucking union.  There's a union of catering hall workers, apparently.  Right.  And they've been just taking their tips.  What?  And keeping it, and then they just pay the fucking staff what they pay them.  How do they do that?  Oh, my God.  I know.  It's amazing, right?  I don't know.  I would assume that's not happening at all.  Wedding halls?  Not at all of them.  But there's a few that are doing that, huh?  There's a few shysters out there.  Wow.  A few shysters.  How do you allow that? 
[00:24:00]  Like, why wouldn't you just keep reaching in and grabbing your tips?  And why would you...  I know, right?  Yeah.  They'd probably fire you.  Catering hall tips are a little different.  It's not like people leave money on the tables.  I think it might be something that's built into a bill.  Included in the bill.  You know what I mean?  And then the workers never see that.  Right.  I think that's probably more of the scam.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's like a...  I'm just, you know...  That makes sense.  But they're not just grabbing their jars off their things.  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, I've never been to a wedding where I left a 20 on the table, you know?  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  Good service. 
[00:24:30]  That was great.  Okay.  I've done that.  Or I find a guy.  I find the one guy that was good to us.  Find a guy.  I didn't this weekend, because there was no real guy.  No, there wasn't.  Right?  I like when there's a guy, you could just, hey, get me drinks.  Yeah.  I had to keep getting up and getting drinks.  Food was awesome.  Yeah, really good.  Usually wedding food sucks.  Wedding food.  It was awesome.  Yeah.  Did you have the salmon?  I did.  And I hadn't eaten all day.  That corn relish thing?  Yeah, the corn was very good.  Oh, the corn relish was great.  I was talking about corn relish.  But it was good.  Holy fuck, that was a nice combination. 
[00:25:00]  Sam's mother's cookie was fucking phenomenal.  She didn't fucking cook them.  She said she, I heard you bake them.  I thought she did.  There's controversy.  She goes, everyone's asking me, but I didn't.  Last thing I want to do is cook 200 cookies the night before the wedding.  Because in her mind, she has to do it right before the wedding so they stay fresh.  Because I felt the cookie was a little lackluster.  I was just being polite.  Yeah, I didn't think the cookie was that great.  Yeah.  She would have done a much better job.  It's going to drive her nuts that she didn't cook that now.  Roland, you have a good time at the wedding. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  What was your highlight, sir?  The cake was delicious.  The cake was delicious?  Yeah.  Drink.  Ate.  I just woke up.  That sounds it.  I'm tired.  What's with the throw?  Did you do something last night?  What happened?  No, I went home and passed out.  He was hanging out at the party table.  I don't know what the fuck was going on at that table, but...  He drank a lot.  There seemed to be other things going on at that table.  I don't know what you're talking about, sir.  Troy seemed to be trying to get everybody high. 
[00:26:00]  Troy was working the table.  Yeah, he's trying to get me high at 12, 1230, 1 o'clock in the morning at the hotel bar.  I'm like, I do want to maybe, you know, toke a little bit here and there eventually,  but I'm not going to start with Troy Kwan and his misfits at 1 in the morning at the hotel bar.  I picture a different scenario, to be honest with you, if I go down that road again.  He was, uh...  Jesus.  Somebody said he was dressed like Ace Ventura. 
[00:26:30]  He had a very colorful jacket on.  And then we got a picture of his outfit.  You got a picture of his outfit?  You should tweet that.  He has it up on his Instagram.  Oh, he's got it up on Instagram.  Okay.  He does?  Where's the...  What is he on Instagram?  I don't know.  Troy Kwan on Instagram.  He is the Ace Ventura look.  Troy Kwan.  Good luck trying to spell that.  Yeah, but something was going on.  You guys had a good party going on at that table.  Yeah, last it till like 3, 4.  Huh?  Last it till like 3 a.m., 4 a.m.  Really?  Where'd you go after the wedding? 
[00:27:00]  There was nowhere to really go.  The lobby.  Because the bar closed, right?  The hotel bar closed at 2.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  We bolted out about an hour, I guess, before everything just pretty much wrapped up.  We made it for the cake.  Yeah, you definitely fucking did it.  Made it for the cake.  It wasn't just a come in and come out really quickly.  But, yeah, we had a good time.  Mm-hmm.  Ace Ventura.  There he is. 
[00:27:30]  What color is that?  I don't even know.  Salmon.  Salmon.  You've got to go with salmon, right?  Salmon.  Isn't salmon kind of a pink color?  Yes.  I was very.  So why aren't we saying it's pink?  And he has a white linen shirt under it.  Yes.  It's a see-through linen shirt.  Yeah.  And he was wearing sneakers with the whole thing, wasn't he?  Yeah, Vance.  Yeah, Vance.  Vance, of course.  Were they the hip sneakers?  Oh, he was very fashionable.  Very fashionable.  Yeah, he.  Indeed.  There was some thought that was put in.  Yeah.  Oh, a lot of thought put into look just like a regular.  I just got my one suit with my one tie that I forgot. 
[00:28:00]  I've got to stop wearing suits to everything that's formal.  Like, apparently, like, you're just allowed to be casual at everything now.  I don't mind that, though.  It's amazing.  I'm just going to be casual at everything now.  I don't mind that.  You know, I would never wear a salmon jacket, but, you know, a casual jacket with no tie.  I'm done wearing suits to weddings.  Yes.  You are just allowed to just wear whatever the fuck you want?  No.  I think that's it.  Amazing.  I think I'm done, too.  I think you're right, Vance.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Fuck that.  I'm throwing my one tie away. 
[00:28:30]  Your one tie.  And really, how long is it on at the wedding?  Like, you put it on just for the second.  And, like, the second you get your first drink, it's off.  So why are we still wearing these things?  And I can't wait to take the suit jacket off, usually, too.  Yeah.  Unless you're freezing.  Well, I was freezing, so I didn't take my suit jacket off the entire night.  Well, no, I had to cover up some ladies, but besides that.  It was cold in there, right, Roland?  No, I was fine.  Oh, Roland's fine.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  Roland wanted to wear shorts.  Yeah, he was comfortable.  Yeah, yeah.  But Roland was almost dressed. 
[00:29:00]  I know.  It was strange to see you almost dressed.  Almost.  It was strange to wear that.  We came close.  Almost dressed.  There was actually a collared shirt, which was really creepy to see.  Yeah, yeah.  On Roland.  Yeah, it was weird.  It was weird.  Any other highlights, Roland?  That's it?  Well, we went to Pepe's Pizza afterwards.  Oh.  In New Haven?  Yeah.  How was it?  Phenomenal.  How far were we from New Haven?  Pretty close.  Really?  I had no idea where we were.  How'd you get there? 
[00:29:30]  Are you just lying?  No.  No, he said the night before he was going to Pepe's Pizza.  Yeah.  We went from after the wedding, the next day we went to Pepe's on the way home.  Oh, the next day.  He's looking forward to it, yeah.  I thought he meant after the wedding.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  The next day.  I think that's impossible.  There were huge buses getting people back and forth.  The morning mash-up was there and getting a little buzzed.  Oh, boy.  Nicole could give you a run for your money.  You do know that, right?  Nicole can drink.  You know she could give you a run for your money. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's out of her fucking mind.  Oh, yes.  Mr. E-Rock.  Oh, well.  Oh, I forgot E-Rock was at the wedding.  Yeah, yeah.  What was your highlight, E-Rock?  Any thoughts on the wedding?  I had two.  One was during the ceremony when they're saying, I do a bird shit on Eastside Days.  Oh, yeah.  And he just goes, ah.  Oh, right.  Was it a nice shit?  Oh, it was all over his shoes.  That's awesome.  And he was trying to clean it.  He didn't have a napkin, so he's trying to scrape it off with the wedding program, and  his wife's yelling him not to do that. 
[00:30:30]  He was trying to be on his best behavior.  Yeah, yeah.  As best as he could be.  He did all right.  That was true.  All he really did was fling himself onto the dance floor at one point.  Literally throwing himself onto the floor.  Yeah.  And screaming like, ow!  Ow!  I don't really know what that means.  I don't either, but that's what he does.  I don't really understand it.  It's his gimmick.  It's his thing.  He falls down and yells how much it hurt him. 
[00:31:00]  Then he would get up and kind of walk off like James Brown and like Sam's kind of consoling  him.  And then he'd push Sam away and run and jump and fall back down on the dance floor.  And throw himself back on the floor again.  It's the weirdest thing to watch.  I think I got like 20 seconds of it.  Maybe I'll post it.  Yeah.  It's just really, I don't know what to do with it.  He's a weirdo.  He's a great guy though, man.  Oh, I love him.  I fucking love his side, Dave.  He's fun.  I think he's really talented and this company really fucked him over.  Although he's kind of doing a little, what, a couple hours on the weekend, right?  On Saturdays, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  When is the show?  7 p.m. on Saturdays.  Davey Mac Sports Program.  Oh.  He should be full time though.  There's a nice plug.  Another good portion of the wedding was during one of the speeches where there was an emotional  pause and Kenny just goes, he lost his place.  Oh, right.  And once again, everyone heard it.  Easily heard that.  He lost his place.  Yeah.  Kenny's hard to figure out.  Did he have a good time?  He's ass-burger-y and an ass.  There's Kenny summed up. 
[00:32:00]  Does he have a good time?  Yeah.  It was very nice.  He acknowledges what a good time looks like and knows how to say that's what it was.  It was a fun time.  His text to me was like, it was good hanging with you.  You are good people.  No, at least it came from the heart.  Eric, yeah, it was nice to hang out with you.  You are good people.  Hope you have a safe, traffic-free ride home.  Traffic-free.  See you tomorrow. 
[00:32:30]  Ah.  You're good people.  What a guy.  He sees me every day.  Hey, E-Rock, were you high?  Yeah, that night didn't end well for me.  Why?  What happened?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did you vomit?  Uh, it...  A little vomit?  Two attempts and nothing came out, but then...  Wait, you were feeling queasy?  Yeah, about 2.30 in the morning.  How much do you hate puking?  And I feel that it's coming, but nothing is happening.  So I'm like, all right, I just go to bed. 
[00:33:00]  And then about an hour and a half later, all of a sudden, I thought I shit my pants.  And I'm checking, I'm like, no, no, and I go running to the bathroom, and I didn't,  but as soon as I turned on the light and pulled my pants down to check, that's when  it happened.  Whoa.  You shit where?  Jesus.  Wait, you didn't puke?  You shit yourself?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock.  Well, wait, how much did you have?  Like, what led up to this?  What exactly led to this?  It was highing and drinking all night.  And then...  Just only a minute you got high, you rule. 
[00:33:30]  The buffet at 2 a.m. didn't help either.  The buffet at 2 a.m.  At what?  The after party, they had a breakfast buffet.  Yeah, it was a breakfast buffet.  Where was it?  Eggs, sausage, bacon.  At the tavern that was in the hotel.  Bacon.  Maple sausage.  Huh?  Maple sausage.  How was it?  Oh, it was great, Ross.  It hit the spot.  Oh, it went right through me.  So, how bad did you shit yourself?  As soon as I got into the bathroom, I turned the light on, I pulled my shorts down to see,  and I bend down to look, and that's when it happened. 
[00:34:00]  So, I got most of it right into the toilet, but...  Oh, God.  Most of it.  Most of it.  Yeah.  Some of it, uh...  Oh, yuck.  Let's just say that the people who have to clean that room aren't going to be too happy  with the towels that were left hidden behind the curtains in the bathtub.  Oh, no!  You cleaned up the shit with towels?  I didn't know what else to do.  Oh, my God.  You just left the towels there, so...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you got to throw the towels away by the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Damn, he's talking like a pro.  You know how to clean up fucking shit towels in a hotel room, mister.  Well, I know for next time now, so...  That dumb little garbage pile in between the elevator doors, the two elevator doors?  Shove it in there?  Shove it in the big, the tall ashtray, standing ashtray thing, yeah.  The small one.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  That's your highlights from the wedding?  You shitting yourself?  Uh, no, that's right.  Oh, and Eastside Dave getting shit on.  Dave.  Oh, with the sparklers, too.  There were sparklers for photo ops.  Oh, we missed the sparklers. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, Dave shot a nice little video with sparklers.  That's all right.  I posted that.  Is it on the Facebook page?  It's on the Facebook page.  All in all, a very nice affair, I thought.  Very nice.  Very, uh, unique to be in the barn, and, um, the food was fucking great.  I was starving, because I had woken up late, and, uh, Ant said, why don't you come up,  because I got to stop in the city?  He said, yeah, all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I took a ride.  I wasn't, I wasn't going to drive up.  But I'm like, why would I drive when I could hop in a car? 
[00:35:30]  Take the old limo up.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  And, uh, I'm glad I did that, because I was tired of not feeling like driving enough time.  Yeah.  I didn't eat.  I didn't have time to eat.  That sounds like a good time, man.  Oh, it was fucking nothing better than not having to drive back.  Right.  Because you know, you know, I know I'm going to be tipping a few back, and, uh, yeah, you  just want to fucking be driving.  You didn't seem like you were tipping too many, though.  No, I was actually in pretty good shape.  I don't know.  It was just such a pain in the ass to get a drink.  Oh, really? 
[00:36:00]  I had to keep getting up and going to the bar.  It was in another room.  Yeah.  So I just was like, uh, and then, you know, they give you the little fucking shot glass  of drink instead of a nice big fucking burly glass.  Instead of a man's drink.  Yeah, you know, eh, it was all right.  Yeah.  And I got, uh, when we got home later on, uh, Jimmy actually came by the house, and, uh,  I was like, yeah, I'm going to make a drink.  And then I was like, I can't even fucking, I can't even drink.  Just didn't feel like it.  Didn't have it in me, uh, Saturday night for some reason. 
[00:36:30]  That's a late night.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You went back out to Anz after getting home from the wedding?  Not that, I got home by, uh, get back to the city by 12, late, or nighter than 12.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, it was pretty early.  It's, it's like, it was, I don't like, I don't like going, I don't like going to bed early  on a weekend.  Like, I like, uh.  You're like you're missing something.  Yeah, I like being up nice and late and going to bed late on a late Saturday night.  Yeah.  It's something that's, for me, it's a healthy thing to do.  It's like, yeah, you're going out, hanging with a friend, nothing deviant, nothing terrible, 
[00:37:00]  you know.  Because I tend to, uh, left to my own device on a Saturday night.  Well, shoving those hot dogs up your ass was not, uh.  Yeah, but at least I didn't eat them.  Shoving them in my ass was one thing, eating them was unhealthy.  I was hungry.  Yeah, but believe me, if I was fucking, if I was riding around by myself, I'd be shoving  other hot dogs up my ass, so it was better.  I don't have any ketchup, Daddy.  Daddy.  So it was fun.  Yeah.  Congratulations to Sam and Jess.  They had chicken fingers at the fucking... 
[00:37:30]  For Sam.  Oh, yeah.  But no, and also at the little reception, the cocktail hour.  Oh, right, right, right.  There was chicken fingers.  And little fries.  Little fries, fucking cheese and crackers.  But that's way better than some dumb mushroom thing.  Would you like a dumb mushroom thing?  It was great.  They don't even know what it is at some of these weddings.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But they had a tiny little thing where it was like four or five French fries in a little,  like a Dixie cup type.  Oh, and a little paper cone thingy, yeah.  I thought that was great. 
[00:38:00]  Yes.  I was all in as far as that goes.  I love my three French fries.  Probably had to go back a few different times.  Three French fries.  During the cocktail hour, Kenny kept, every now and then, a different waiter or waitress  would come by, and Kenny would interrogate as to why they were carrying that particular  dish or what they were doing here.  Okay.  He's like, what are you doing with that?  He's like, do you want one?  And he had to make them explain what was in each item, and then he would say no.  Of course.  That's the lovely and talented Kenny.  Yes.  Love him.  He's unique. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We should break, man.  We got other things to talk about.  We got a busy show today.  Very busy.  Oh, many guests, this is.  We have a Paul Williams controversy.  I at least want to talk about it.  It's all good.  Paul's coming in, and we're going to treat him like a rock star.  But he never forgot something that was done on this show many years ago.  That I forgot.  I forgot, too.  Or I didn't even know it happened, honestly.  I was just hoping it wasn't going to come up.  You want to explain after the break, I guess?  We'll do that? 
[00:39:00]  All right.  Paul Williams is coming in.  Do most people know who Paul Williams is?  I think so, yeah.  He's a fucking legend, man.  Yeah, his documentary was called Still Alive, and it's what he's promoting.  Yeah, everyone knows from the late night talk.  He was the short guy with long blonde hair.  He almost looked like a taller version of Cousin Oliver from the Brady Bunch, and he had glasses.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  But he was a funny, like, he did 50 Tonight Shows with Carson.  Yeah.  He did 50 Carsons.  Wow.  He was that guy. 
[00:39:30]  And he was in Smokey the Bennett.  He was the short little-iness.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's thirsty.  Right.  Dummy.  He was in everything.  He was in so many movies.  Yeah.  Oscar-winning songwriter.  And wrote so many of the memorable songs of the day.  Yeah.  Like, give me one.  Oh, how about Evergreen?  From the Star is Born.  What?  Yeah, Star is Born song.  Oh.  And, uh, what's the big Muppet song?  Rainbow Connection.  Love that is shed by two.  I have found...  He wrote that? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And the Rainbow Connection.  He wrote the Rainbow Connection.  Yes, Kermit's song.  Holy shit.  The Rainbow Connection.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He wrote the Love Boat.  Oh, did he really?  The Love Boat.  Soon you'll be making.  And he wrote, uh, just an old-fashioned love song.  Oh, yeah.  Playing on the radio.  But he would walk out in his little suit.  And I loved him, though, because he would belt these tunes out.  And he shouldn't have been a sex symbol, but women really wanted to fuck this dude. 
[00:40:30]  Is he officially a midget?  I don't know.  I don't know.  5'2", maybe.  He might be even shorter.  Well, how tall is he?  Can you see?  But he was an unlikely sex symbol.  There's a few clips in that, um, in that documentary where he's playing a kid, and it said he's 24 years old or something, and he looked like a child.  Really?  Yeah.  Can you see that picture, Danny?  Because he looks, he actually looks younger now, or as young.  That's him, like, now. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  And he's 71.  Yeah.  He, uh, he was on a Yo Gabba Gabba recently.  Oh, was he?  That's how I know him.  Remember the odd couple?  I thought that I watched children's programs.  We'll cover this later, too, but the odd couple.  5'2", you're right.  Oh, yeah.  The odd couple.  When Felix's daughter loved him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Paul Williams.  Felix's daughter was following Paul Williams around, and I believe he was going to be playing in Albany.  Well, we should tell the people what happened, then.  Who got the email over the weekend? 
[00:41:30]  I didn't even know until Jimmy brought it up at the wedding.  I'm like, no, he remembers.  Roland got a phone call.  You got a phone call, and what did they say?  There's a little problem.  He remembers, I think, 10 or 11 years ago.  Not naming names.  Somebody hung up on him.  It said something rude.  It said something rude.  Who do you think?  I said, what have you done in 10 years or something like that?  Yes.  Or lately.  Yeah, and he said nothing, and then it's irrelevant, and he hung up on him.  Oh, boy.  That was the quote.  You got it close, yes. 
[00:42:00]  So we never officially did the interview?  No.  Oh, boy.  So Roland emailed me and said, Paul Williams' problem.  He goes, you don't have to email.  If you email the publicist and kind of talk to him.  So he gave me the publicist's email, so I emailed him and told him truthfully, I don't remember the incident.  I'm like, I may not have been in that day, but I'm like, I can't explain why.  Sometimes we just do dumb stuff on the radio show.  It's like it doesn't mean anything, but we're looking forward to meeting Paul.  We're not having him in to be ironic.  I just told the truth. 
[00:42:30]  We saw the documentary.  It was great, and it's surreal.  We really want to talk to Paul Williams.  And he emailed me back.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Okay, cool.  And then I checked my other email a day later, and Paul had emailed me.  Really?  Yeah, very friendly.  Nice.  He went, hey, man, that was nice.  Thanks for addressing my concern.  And he wasn't being a baby about it.  He was just a concern.  He was very, very nice.  He really is a guy that knows where he is now, accepts everything.  He's very happy with where he is.  Yeah.  And what I saw in the documentary, you know? 
[00:43:00]  So you get kind of an impression of him from the old days, but it's not really who he is.  Yeah.  It was a very, very interesting documentary just about what his life is now.  Yeah.  Because he was such a, he was on, you could, if you said Paul Williams now, some people go,  who?  Like, you know, a lot of younger people don't know, but, you know.  Ah, he was a TV and movie icon.  Everywhere.  He never turned down a gig.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  He was in there.  They showed all these old clips.  They got archive footage from everything in this.  Yeah.  And they showed clips of fucking, a really awful scene with Angie Dickinson shooting him 
[00:43:30]  in Police Woman.  Oh, Police Woman, yeah.  He played a bad guy in Police Woman.  And she goes, you're under arrest for murder.  And he's looking like all, like shocked.  And then he pushes her against the wall, pulls a gun out.  It's like Paul Williams playing the heavy.  Yeah.  It didn't quite pan out.  I'm trying to, I want to know the circumstances of us hanging up on him back in the day.  So, there's probably just that moment, what he was promoting and all that. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, we don't know.  Our listeners do.  There are listeners that know way more about this show than we do.  I don't remember.  I don't remember that we hung up on him, to be completely honest with you.  I didn't either.  And that's what I'm going to tell him, too.  Wasn't that we, it was just an I?  An I.  I did not remember that.  But I don't remember the circumstances on that one at all.  If someone knows, please let us know.  Yeah.  All right, so we've got Paul Williams, we've got Uriah Faber coming in.  Uriah Faber, yes.  Who's fighting, actually, on the next fight I'm going to.  And he's promoting a book called, It's a California Kid, The Laws of the Ring. 
[00:44:30]  It's about his life.  And I started it, and it's very good, but what I got through.  Very cool.  Yeah, he's been on the show before.  It's cool.  Yeah.  And then Anthony Bourdain.  Nice.  He's a comic book book, Anthony Bourdain.  Yeah, it comes out.  Marvel's just sent that to me.  It comes out in July.  They should have given us this because I would have read it.  Like, it's called...  You made this?  Get Jiro.  It's like a hardcover comic book that looks really cool.  There's a severed arm right here.  Right. 
[00:45:00]  Graphic novel, Jimmy.  Oh, there's a graphic novel.  It's about a severed head.  Oh, yeah.  A comic book form.  Wait, you know what?  A graphic novel is different than a comic book.  What is the difference?  Is it a hardcover?  A hardcover, and it's usually like a collection of like 10 comic books in one graphic novel.  Oh.  So it's longer than a comic book would be.  Well, yeah.  It's just that it's packaged differently.  And then you get to spend an extra 20 bucks on it.  Oh, look at that ass.  Oh, well.  Got a naked idiot here. 
[00:45:30]  And he's leaving no reservations.  Is he?  A lot of controversy.  Why?  He's leaving the travel...  Oh, I'll have to ask him.  He's leaving the travel channel to do a show for CNN.  I've heard that's not true.  Oh.  I just wanted to start some controversy.  Oh.  I didn't hear that at all, actually.  I heard nothing of it.  According to the paper today, the travel channel was very surprised by the announcement.  Oh, really?  That he's leaving.  Yeah.  And he just filmed his last one in Brooklyn.  Oh.  Oh, right here in... 
[00:46:00]  So we'll have to ask him about that.  He's coming in at 8.30.  Oh, God.  There's a great picture of him.  I didn't know it was in Brooklyn with Jamie Hector and Michael K. Williams, Marlo and  Omar from The Wire.  There's a picture of the three of them at a table, and I guess it was in Brooklyn.  I was like, he must have shot around here recently.  Yeah.  Over the weekend, I guess he was doing some stuff.  So there you go.  And we got to talk about Richard Dawson next.  Oh, my God.  I hope you got that clip, E-Rock.  Strange things happen on this show from time to time. 
[00:46:30]  Just really weird, strange things.  Weird coincidence.  And the Richard Dawson one is very strange.  Yeah.  We'll explain next.  Stay there.  Gather round, kids, for a tale of childhood trauma.  It's a molestation memory with our friend, Jim Florentine.  My dad used to take us to wrestling matches at Madison Square Garden, and we met this guy  out front who would sell wrestling pictures.  Fat guy, 300 pounds, a bad mustache.  You know, and we became friends with him somehow.  He's like, oh, give me your address. 
[00:47:00]  He started sending us pictures of all the kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call me on the phone and tell me about the match the night before.  And my voice was about this.  It was this deep at 14.  He's on the other end, and I'm asking all these questions, and he's fucking breathing heavy.  I had no idea.  But then he wound up staying over at my house.  He knew all the kids in the neighborhood because we all got to the matches.  He convinced my dad.  He's like, oh, you know, I want to hang with the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  He took the bus from New York to New Jersey.  And my parents are a little weird about it. 
[00:47:30]  Like, I don't know.  But like, all right.  You know, they talk to the other parents and neighbor.  You think this is all right?  I see.  You know, he's a 40 year old guy hanging around 14 year olds.  They put him in the guest room the night before.  I wake up in the morning.  I'm sleeping.  He has his hand on my pants.  He snuck down there.  And I fucking jump.  I go, what are you doing?  He had my cock.  He goes, I'm showing you a magic trick.  I'm like, a magic trick?  I just said, I ran to the door to go tell my brothers, my older brothers.  And he blocked the door.  He goes, he went right to the photo album.  He goes, look, I'll give you.  I got 50 pictures and I'll give you 35 of them if you don't say anything. 
[00:48:00]  But my brothers were like, my brothers afterwards go, you got to tell mom and dad about this.  I go, no, because they were going to make me get the pictures back.  I'm like, fuck that.  I earned them.  Fucking kissed him on the cheek.  I sat on his lap.  He grabbed my cock.  I should have got dad in this camera.  This has been a molestation moment with our friend, Jim Florentine.  Now you know why he is the way he is.  The kids are running wild because school's out, but cool.  No reason to get antsy. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Jim.  Oh my God.  California is trendsetting again with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody.  Hey, Jim, did you like hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad?  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh my God. 
[00:49:00]  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley, and in the valley, we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops.  Turn it up.  Middle finger time.  Time.  Like, that's my grandmother.  Oh my God, you're so old, you should call dirt by name or something.  And a special appearance by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes.  Hello.  Well, whatever. 
[00:49:30]  You're, uh, grody.  Yes.  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Jim, coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk?  Like, with my butt or something?  3SXM.  The O.B.  and Anthony Show.  We're back. 
[00:50:00]  Anyone else see Russell Brand on the MTV Movie Awards?  Holy fuck, this guy sucks.  It was terrible.  From what I saw, I watched Game of Thrones, of course.  Right, right, right.  But, uh...  Right, right, right, right.  Oh, nice.  Oh, did you get shocked?  No.  Oh, your earpiece phone thing fell off.  I'm trying to do this one-handed so I can finish my breakfast, and, uh, my fucking thing fell off.  I hate that the little pad things fall off of the headphones so easily.  What are they, Sony headphones?  Yeah, these are good headphones, usually. 
[00:50:30]  No, that's like their one fucking downfall.  Doesn't fall off.  Yeah.  Uh, Russell Brand, I don't know, man.  Yeah, he was...  He was really fucking annoying.  And not that funny.  The whole show sucks.  And not in that, like, it's cool to say that MTV Awards show sucks.  Yeah.  It just really sucks.  It was terrible.  It might have passed us by.  I think it's made for, like, 15-year-old girls.  Is it because they were dragging people out, you know, and talking about things that...  I think...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I didn't get it. 
[00:51:00]  I think they've lost, like, touch with everything, though.  I don't know.  It's just fucking...  It was odd.  Russell Brand thinks he's really fucking cool.  He's in that Jack Black category of annoyance.  Who's in that fucking category?  Jack Black and Russell Brand?  It's cool to just come out and look unshowered and, you know, fucking riff.  Right.  Just riffing.  But he is showered.  Yeah, of course.  Everything on that guy's body was thought about. 
[00:51:30]  Very calculated.  It was pretty much just a commercial for movies.  Right.  Like, in a star-fucking event where celebrities came out, plugged their latest blockbuster, and  didn't want to be there, and left.  Like, Christian Bale comes out for the new Batman movie, which I don't think is going to  need any real publicity on MTV.  And he just...  You could tell he doesn't want to be there.  The MTV Movie Awards. 
[00:52:00]  Or is that the thing?  To look like you don't want to be there?  Maybe that.  Because some of the people were doing that, too.  So you don't know what's real and what's not.  I was just like, this is fucking awful.  That new Spider-Man movie, though.  I didn't see that part.  You didn't see the trailer?  No, I didn't see that part.  Does it look good?  Man, I think it looks good.  Going a little darker with the whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  I didn't...  A reboot of a movie that isn't that old.  That they rebooted. 
[00:52:30]  A 10-year reboot?  10 years.  Is it 10 years?  We're doing a 10-year reboot.  I mean, I think...  I'm probably wrong, but I think Spider-Man was...  Yeah.  ...2001?  Yeah, somewhere around there, right?  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Yeah, it looks good, though, man.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.  You want to at least try to listen to one minute of Russell Brand from last night?  Um...  We don't have to.  Oh, Spider-Man.  You want to go for a minute?  Sure.  All right, see if you can last a minute.  Welcome, welcome to the MTV Movie Awards 2012. 
[00:53:00]  Thanks, Martin Solvig, for spinning us in with music and for remaining here throughout the night doing that.  Twilight!  What?  Hunger Games!  What he was doing, because his material was lacking...  Yeah.  ...big fucking time...  Yeah.  ...he knew he would get a huge reaction, because the audience is filled with a lot of young fucking girls... 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  ...that he would mention Twilight and Hunger Games, knowing that would get a reaction.  Yeah.  So, after these jokes were going absolutely nowhere and laying flat, he would go,  Twilight, Hunger Games, and everyone would be cheering, like they were just cheering for  that horrible line he did.  Right.  Tonight is an important ceremony, because according to the Mayans, the world will end in December  this year.  If Earth hurtles into the sun and humanity is destroyed, we will all say as one, we had 
[00:54:00]  the MTV Awards 2012, and it was worth it.  Worth it.  I hate his fucking accent.  It's a fake accent at this point.  Yeah, it's gotta be.  Well, let's not worry about the impending doom of our planet now.  We have vital issues to discuss.  One, Justin Bieber beat up a paparazzi.  Well done, Justin!  Edgy.  That was edgy right there.  He's just fucking...  He's an edgy guy.  Justin, though, is so pretty that I think that even if he was attacking me, I would do a 
[00:54:30]  little orgasm.  It's his hair!  If convicted, Justin could face up to six months in jail.  I imagine that even inside, as the horror of incarceration closes in on him, and the nightly  gang beatings in the shower tangle that beautiful barnet, that in some quiet part of himself, he'll  be thinking, at least I got away from them bloody screaming girls.  Twilight!  Hunger Games! 
[00:55:00]  See what he's doing there?  See what he's doing there?  This is terrible.  Material falling flat, so he goes for the easy applause.  Terrible!  And if, after recent events, you think it's hypocritical of me to joke about a celebrity beating  up a paparazzi, wait till you hear what I've got to say about it shortly.  Oh, he must have cursed.  Kim Kardashian has found a new man, Kanye.  I admire Kanye a lot. 
[00:55:30]  His drunken stage invasion of the last MTV award show I hosted took a lot of pressure  off me.  Like watching someone else get in trouble at school.  I owe you one, Kanye.  And Kim took a lot of pressure off me with her world record quick marriage.  Cheers, Kim.  I just hope that the two of them do a new sex tape.  I think he's about to, yeah, I think we'd like that.  I think of Kim Kardashian as the Stanley Kubrick of sex tapes. 
[00:56:00]  They're always brilliant, but she only does one a decade.  I'd prefer one with Kanye, though, as co-star to that other bloke in the original.  He was a bit too pleased with himself, wasn't he?  A bit smug in the sex tape.  Ruined it for me.  Don't drink before the sex tape, though, Kanye.  Learn the lessons of the VMAs.  When you're drunk, you do have a propensity to pounce on unsuspecting girls from the rear  with a bottle in your hand.  Very good in an MTV show, but could really ruin a sex tape. 
[00:56:30]  Now, since we ain't got Kanye here tonight, I need someone in this audience more unstable.  Are you done?  Wow.  Are you done?  I want to hear one more joke.  I'm going.  And reckless than me to do something crazy if I say something stupid and start jeopardizing  my green card.  That someone is obviously Charlie Sheen, everyone.  Charlie!  Charlie, you do look well and relatively sober, so what I've done is I've taped a bottle of 
[00:57:00]  Hennessy and a gram of Coke under your chair.  In case I start going crazy, just neck it, do a couple of lines.  Release the tiger blood hero.  Twilight!  Hunger Games!  Chip liked it.  That was good. 
[00:57:30]  I would have said that, too.  That's good.  It's just some of that, wow, we're so outrageous.  He's so crazy.  Look at him going.  I don't know.  I'm not feeling it.  Wow.  Then, yeah, every segment it was another promotion for a movie, which, you know, whatever.  But don't try to present it under the guise of an award show. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  That was just terrible.  And what were some of the awards?  They're trying to be cool and fucking edgy with the awards.  Best Dirtbag.  Best Dirtbag.  That was pretty much the only one I saw.  I saw the Russell Brand opening, then I saw Dirtbag.  I don't know.  Best Dirtbag.  Best Dirtbag was given to Jennifer Aniston.  Really?  Wasn't that Villain?  It used to be like MTV Movie Award, Best Villain.  Yeah, something like that.  And now it's Dirtbag.  I get it.  They're trying to be edgy.  They changed with the times, man. 
[00:58:30]  I went back to the Celtics heat game.  I was done.  Yeah.  I tried.  I was done.  That's all I saw.  Terrible.  Yeah.  I guess the new movie's coming out.  Yeah, Total Recall.  The reboot of Total Recall.  See, that could be good.  If they do it right, it's August.  Yeah.  Who's playing Arnold?  Colin Farrell.  Is he?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I didn't even realize, uh, Cohagen will be Bryan Cranston. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Of Breaking Bad.  Sure.  Yes.  Malcolm in the Middle fame.  Yep.  Oh, that's cool.  I want to see Ted.  Yeah.  Of course you do, Gregory!  I want to see Ted.  Not that Ted.  Ted.  So far, the trailers and everything they're released for that movie, it looks hilarious.  Yeah.  I want to see Ted.  Tuesday, I get to see Prometheus tomorrow.  Yes.  I don't know what that is.  Yes.  Oh, please.  It's a wild space movie, Jimmy. 
[00:59:30]  Just a crazy space adventure.  Oh, God.  I don't do it.  If your hat falls off in space, you'd never get it back.  Thanks, but...  That's the slug line for the movie.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll be down here.  It's Ridley Scott, who of course did Alien, and Gladiator, and...  Who are the stars in Robin Hood?  Robin Hood, well.  Okay.  He also did Blade Runner.  Who's in this thing?  Charlize, and the guy, and then that chick, and then another guy, and... 
[01:00:00]  It should be good.  There's an Alien tie-in.  It appears, isn't it?  What time is the screening tomorrow?  Right after the show, hopefully?  No, it's later.  Oh, later in the day?  Later.  Yeah, I want to check that out, too.  We be going, yo.  I want to check out the new Adam Sandler movie.  Oh, great.  It has potential.  It has potential. 
[01:00:30]  Don't you think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We might have Andy Samberg coming in, so...  It has potential.  I think that movie has potential.  We'll see.  We'll see how it does.  Oh, boy.  That just looks terrible.  You can't say that.  It looks terrible.  We got Andy Samberg coming in.  He's a big star.  Oh, I know, but...  So can we say the movie has potential?  You're not digging it, huh?  No.  What's the problem with the movie?  Adam Sandler's in it.  He's terrible. 
[01:01:00]  He started out good, though, man.  First few were good.  Yeah, well, I guess it was the timing.  But this one looks like he's going back to old school, Adam Sandler.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The gimmick is like he was a kid and he had sex with his teacher.  And the teacher had a baby.  So he's not too far in age away from his son.  Yeah.  Probably 16 years.  So he's the irresponsible one.  The son is the responsible one.  Well, I haven't seen that done in Hollywood yet.  I bet. 
[01:01:30]  I bet by the end of this movie, they're going to teach each other a little bit about loosening  up and having some fun and maybe being a little responsible with your life.  No, that would be crazy.  I don't know.  Isn't this just like Big Daddy 2?  Oh, that's it.  The kid grew up and now it's like a continuation pretty much.  But that would be the first time that has happened in Hollywood where they would have  some kind of lesson involved with the jokes.  It's a brand new concept.  Why can't they just make a movie where it's just jokes? 
[01:02:00]  Why does there have to be some kind of lesson by the end of this?  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know you can roll in a heart attack, right?  Why?  Because we have Andy Samberg coming in.  When?  Soon.  To promote that very movie.  That's my boy.  It looks good.  Look at the movie poster.  Oh, it looks terrible.  Look.  Oh, it looks terrible.  No, look.  I'm assuming that's where they live. 
[01:02:30]  That big, gigantic mansion house behind them.  So this is yet another movie where Adam Sandler is magically, just has endless bags of money  that he can do whatever he wants with.  He loves to live in really nice houses in his movies.  You're right.  Why?  I don't know what that is.  Can't we just have a movie where Adam Sandler is a down-on-his-luck guy?  Right.  No, everything has to be over the top.  He's very rich in his movies.  Although he's not rich.  His son is, but he moves in with his son.  Okay, of course.  Rain over me, he was-  What happened?  Rain over me, he was down-and-out.  What? 
[01:03:00]  Rain over me, Sandler's movie.  Rain over me, it's down-and-out.  What was rain over me about?  Because no one saw it.  I mean, literally, no one saw it.  Some rich, semi-retarded guy running around getting into antics?  No, his family died in 9-11, and then he was struggling with it.  Don and Sheila was in there.  Oh, yeah.  Sounds hilarious.  That was a drama.  But no one saw it.  Oh, literal Roland.  No one saw it, though, Roland.  But we can't see Ted.  Roland's a huge Adam Sandler movie fan. 
[01:03:30]  Yes.  You love Adam Sandler movies.  He's funny.  I don't know why.  That's my boy.  When do we got Andy Samberg coming out?  Friday.  All right.  And next week, we can see Ted.  So make sure-  I'm right here, Roland!  Wait, we get to see Ted next week?  Yes, you do, Gregory!  Nice.  Well, here's the deal, Roland.  This is what we need from you.  Yes.  Make sure we don't have a chance of seeing That's My Boy before Andy Samberg comes in.  Oh, that's a good idea.  I need to care of that.  Do not give us screener copies.  Don't offer us anything.  There's beer cans on the floor. 
[01:04:00]  I didn't see that.  Oh, see?  Oh, they're on the grass!  It's like a trail.  It's like a trail coming out of his house.  Are you trying to say that Adam Sandler's turning this into kind of a frat house?  Well, that's the big house.  I think Andy plays his son, and the big house is probably Andy's through his diligence and  hard work.  Yes.  And Adam probably moves in.  Oh!  He's the crazy dad.  So it's like National Lampoon vacation.  I love how in the poster he's wearing work boots with a leisure suit, but the pants have 
[01:04:30]  to be short.  It's crazy.  That's crazy.  It's crazy.  That says crazy right there.  In the beer cans.  He's holding the beer can.  Of course, no name.  But he's still holding the beer can.  Like it's Laverne and Shirley.  There's no name on the fucking beer cans.  No, I don't think so.  Is there?  No.  It's blue.  Yeah, it's trying to be like Miller Lite, I think.  Yeah.  I know my light beer cans.  Yeah, with a touch of maybe bud.  That's all it is for him to show up and wreck everything.  You think he's going to wreck a few things?  Oh, God.  Things are going good until Dad shows up. 
[01:05:00]  Like he's spilling the beer on his tux.  Ah, shit.  He is.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Can we see the trailer?  Please.  We should really look at the trailer.  Roland, you're going to have a fucking heart attack?  No.  Roland just opened his eyes wide and he's like, no.  Andy Samberg is a very funny guy.  I like Andy.  Yeah, we like Andy.  But Adam is a good dude.  Right.  Make sure we don't see this movie before Friday.  Fuck Adam Samberg.  Let's at least have some laughs here.  Jesus, enough of this guy.  Let's have some laughs.  Oh, no.  I've got to put my birthday in.  Oh, Dan.  Happy birthday.  You have to put your birthday in for what reason?  Well, there's graphic content. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, make sure.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Oh, man.  It's a...  Wait, wait.  I didn't even hit play yet.  I know.  It's a candlestick bowling.  That's candlestick bowling.  Candlestick bowling.  That's what they do up there in the Massachusetts area.  But why are they laying there like they're bowling balls?  Did you guys have Richard Dawson out here?  Oh, what?  Did you have Richard Dawson out here?  Wait, why are they all laying there like they got bowled down there?  Oh, boy.  They must have run down the lanes and smashed their bodies into the candle pin. 
[01:06:00]  Uh-oh.  You're not supposed to do that.  No, you're not.  Someone said we've got to play Adam Sandler for the VMAs or the movie awards last night.  Was he in there?  I don't know.  Maybe we could take a listen and see what that was about.  Maybe we need to play that today, too.  You want to play the trailer, Jimmy?  All right, let's hear it.  Sure.  Roland, you want to leave?  Yeah.  Johnny Berger.  You were like a god to me and my friends growing up.  You fucked your teacher in the seventh grade.  You are a hero.  You are a dirty boy. 
[01:06:30]  Why are you so naughty?  I'm just a regular guy who did a wicked fucking awesome thing.  Were you thinking that when you were doing whippets with strippers in our kitchen or when  you passed out going down on my pediatrician in my bed?  Oh, man.  We were friends until you banged my mother.  Were you on crack?  You suck.  You are an imbecilic, immature, obnoxious, uneducated, ignorant asshole who I would like  to fuck hard and long.  So I'm going to go put a dent in that.  Did you pause that?  What are they trying to establish there?  I don't know.  I don't know what they're trying to establish. 
[01:07:00]  I'll say this.  It's definitely different than other Sandler trailers with the language.  Yes.  It's rated R, obviously.  Well, this is the latest thing.  You put out an R-rated trailer.  I like that a lot better than anything else I've seen, trailer-wise.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know how funny they'll be, but at least I know it's...  Edgy?  Yeah.  I mean, for an Adam Sandler movie, definitely.  I just hope that candlestick bowling thing.  Roland, tell me no one got hurt. 
[01:07:30]  And that's a quick trailer.  I like that.  Yeah, it did look bad.  That was 40 seconds.  Well, I'm sure there's eight different cuts.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Yeah.  20-minute trailer.  When they just kind of go in for the big joke.  Did we ruin our...  And that gets quiet.  We're good?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was saying the trailer looked a lot better than we thought it would.  Yeah.  If I can see, we turned it around, Roland.  Hey, they have stills that describe all the characters.  Really?  Let's see that.  Would you like to know about Adam's character?  Sure.  His name is Donnie, and he's interested in beer, mixtapes, helping ladies achieve maximum 
[01:08:00]  pleasure, beer, titties, listening to classical music, and then in parentheses, that means  Zeppelin, Rush, Van Halen.  See, they twisted that.  About me.  Wait, Jimmy, what's wrong?  Jimmy.  Jimmy's looking at my hand itches.  My forehead itches.  You don't like these made-up bios?  I don't know.  Don't you want to know about Donnie? 
[01:08:30]  It just seems to me.  He's wild.  Crazy guy, right?  Why don't they just say that?  Like, Donnie, first of all, bio should just be, he's wild.  This is like a morning show bio.  Remember we used to read the morning show bios?  Oh, yes.  Beer and titties.  He's wild.  He likes beer and titties.  Uh-oh, who's coming?  Guy over there likes beer and titties.  Oh, God.  Lock up.  Lock the doors.  Wild guy coming. 
[01:09:00]  Well, you know, about Donnie.  One of Morton Downey Jr.'s ten most intriguing people of 1985.  That's about him.  Wicked Good Hair.  He's a giver.  Just a reminder for the ladies.  He sang Shout at the Devil Online with Motley Crue at the Boston Garden.  And his personal quote?  I didn't spill my beer, fucker.  What does that even mean?  I didn't spill my beer, fucker.  Yeah.  It's the type of quote that just a crazy guy would give.  I mean, come on. 
[01:09:30]  What'd he say?  I didn't spill my beer, fucker.  Oh, God.  Trouble.  Trouble brewing.  Where'd Roland go?  He left.  Oh, he left the studio.  Hopefully he's fucking nose diving at an elevator shift.  Roland left the studio.  Oh.  He knows how to leave.  Trouble.  Oh, you're right.  Beer and titties.  Uh-oh.  Trouble brewing.  I didn't say anything about me about his mental retardation, because I'm wondering what 
[01:10:00]  his affliction is because of his voice.  Yeah, that's not a normal person.  Normal face, cleft palate voice.  Titty and beer.  Uh-oh.  Well, let's get the bio of his son.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to guess it's more stable.  Andy Samberg's character.  You think it's more stable, Jimmy?  Yeah, like likes, books, laughter with friends, and hammocks.  It'll be something healthier.  All right.  You got that.  Well, his interests are his fiancee, keeping a low profile, having a normal life. 
[01:10:30]  That seems like the complete opposite.  Dude, how could you put these two together?  It's going to be an explosion.  We got a movie here.  You got a complete opposite.  Something's going to have to happen now.  Going back to Ant's point.  Well, you know, it's going to be all wild, and then they'll have a falling out, and then  they'll realize they kind of need each other.  They kind of need each other.  You know, I was really ready to shit all over this thing, but I didn't realize that Vanilla 
[01:11:00]  Ice is in it as himself.  So that's really got me turned around now.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  As himself?  Was there anything else with Andy Samberg?  That was it for his bio?  Well, no.  If you want to know about him, let's see.  People call him the human calculator.  It says his parents died in an explosion.  I'm assuming that he's trying to hide Adam Sandler.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  And there's a quote that says, I guess he says this in the movie, folks.  So what, Donnie?  You're just going to get a handjob in front of all of us? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, I hope that's not in the movie.  Oh, my God.  That would be crazy.  Why would that be a quote?  That's like a line from the movie.  Well, that's a quote.  Oh, boy.  This is terrible.  So he calls his father Donnie, huh?  I mean, it's great.  Look at all these funny characters.  Look, James Caan.  James Caan's in it?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, and the Taya Yellow Ribbon guy is, too.  Tony Orlando?  I think he's in this, too, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  And my boy Rex Ryan's in it.  Yep.  Rex Ryan?  Yep.  There he is.  Jokes.  There's the Taya, the Yellow Ribbon guy, right?  That's him.  Tony Orlando is in it.  Hmm.  I can't.  Here's that funny picture that you like.  Yeah.  I guess we'll just wait and see.  Jimmy loves the funny pictures.  Jimmy.  What?  You got to pick it up. 
[01:12:30]  What?  But see, they're all on the floor like they're bowling balls or something.  They're finally all having fun together.  Oh, that's good.  That's how it can stop it.  What is that?  You got Adam Sandler in one lane knocking down the pins and his son in the other lane knocking  down the pins.  And don't forget Vanilla Ice.  And Vanilla Ice.  That guy.  We're all on the same page.  You know, I bet that's after they all realize, you know, a little, little, little fun is  okay.  A little unpredictable, spontaneous, dangerous fun. 
[01:13:00]  It's all right.  You think they teach each other something else?  Oh, absolutely.  You know, but still, you got to get up for work the next day.  We could probably play a game and try to guess what's on the soundtrack.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, well.  By the way, Roland, yeah, I would like to do that.  I'm sorry.  I got distracted because remember Roland said that Adam Sandler was not rich in Rain Over  Me.  He ended up becoming really rich from the insurance money.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So he's rich in that movie, too.  Why does he always have to be rich?  Right.  He's loaded. 
[01:13:30]  Because it's just a great excuse to set up the rest of the screenplay, I guess.  Like, it's just, it just takes care of so many things for you.  Well, what's about this character?  Well, he's rich.  So that way he could just have like a flying car and buy everything that he needs to all  throughout the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know why.  Wasn't Mr. Deeds, wasn't that plot line revolving around him inheriting like a ton of money?  A shitload of money.  Yeah.  He's been rich in just about every one of his movies. 
[01:14:00]  Well, I'm looking forward to this.  That's my boy in theaters June 15th, and we're going to have Andy Sandberg come in at  the end of the week.  Friday.  Yeah.  But not Adam Sandler.  Well...  He's too big of a star for us.  If you take Andy Sandberg, we're going to take Adam Sandler.  Oh, really?  One of those situations?  You're going to take Andy Sandberg.  Speaking of movies, the Avengers is now the number three movie of all time.  What's one and two?  I would think...  Yeah, I know.  It's got to be.  Avatar?  Yeah.  And Titanic? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  It's got to be.  Titanic?  Still?  It's got to be.  Are you kidding?  Plus, they just re-released it, and I'm sure they're attacking on the gross of all the  Titanic 3D tickets.  Did anyone go and see the 3D version of Titanic around here?  I did.  It was very good.  Yeah?  You're kidding.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Yeah, all right.  You scared me for a second.  The only 3D movie I've ever seen so far to this day, because I feel it's the only movie  that really can take 3D to where it needs to be, is Jackass 3D.  When the fucking dildos flying at your face? 
[01:15:00]  They're just dildos flying at you, and 3D duty shooting into the air?  I mean, that's what 3D is for.  It was pretty good.  I'm not going to lie.  I didn't mind the Avatar.  I know it's not a popular opinion on this show, but I didn't mind that movie in 3D.  Then you see it on TV.  They should not show it on TV at all.  It looks ridiculous.  It's all about the 3D?  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Richard Dawson.  This is weird, man.  I'm going to go back in time a few days.  Oh, you got the clip? 
[01:15:30]  Out of nowhere, we're talking about Richard Dawson on our show.  Yeah.  Why would we talk about Richard Dawson?  But we did.  Well, it came up in conversation.  This is from, I believe, 3 days ago.  4 days, maybe.  But then they got off the hook.  Game of the Hatfield-McCoy Family Feud Special.  Ahead, once-in-the-McCoy Family, Jimmy Rich-  I guess what happened, Ant's watching that Hatfield and McCoy, right?  Hatfields and McCoys?  I watched it.  Was it good?  Three-part little mini-series.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  And it up good? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, like, you know, Bill Paxton in anything, you know, you can't lose.  And it got huge ratings.  Hey, Hatfields are coming!  It was his stupid fucking, his stupid delivery.  I got a two-minute clip here.  I don't need the whole clip.  Yeah.  Just a part about what we said about Richard Dawson.  I thought there was a black guy in there.  They're all dressed old school with guns.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck have they got guns?  Only in 1979.  They're all coming out with guns.  They're all coming out with guns.  They're all coming out with guns. 
[01:16:30]  They're looking at this now.  People.  On your marks, let's finish the Family Feud.  Oh, let's finish it.  Richard Dawson.  It's got to be, right?  Come on, Richard.  It's got to be, right?  The star with Family Feud.  Richard Dawson.  Yeah.  He's just going to stop making out with the Hatfield and McCoy women.  Put your fucking guns down, you anchor.  Wow.  Is he dead?  Oh, God.  He's still alive.  Really?  Who's the pig?  Pretty sure.  Who said he was dead? 
[01:17:00]  I'm going to make him feel at home.  Ray Collins is dead.  Green acres.  Wow.  Did you hear that?  He was dead.  That was fucking last week.  Is he dead?  Is he dead?  I thought he was dead.  Well.  Well, now he's dead.  Kind of random.  No one has heard about Richard Dawson in years.  We play a fucking clip because of what you were talking about that day.  Hatfield, yeah.  And then we asked if he was dead.  Now he is dead.  Now he is.  Everyone charming motherfucking pig.  Welcome to day two of this day two. 
[01:17:30]  It really is kind of fun.  He is fucking hammered.  Sounds dry.  Best out of five.  That's going to settle it.  He's a good host.  A lot of money, of course.  Who gives it?  Why would I say that?  He's a good host, though.  Why would I throw that in there?  Who's a good host?  What, is he?  Who gives a fuck?  But I've seen that like, oh yeah, he is a good host.  Oh, look at this.  I would think Charles Nelson Reilly would be like the last surviving member of the match  game.  Is he still alive?  Cast.  Uh-oh.  Should we say it?  Don't even say it. 
[01:18:00]  I believe Charles Nelson Reilly is still alive.  Oh.  I believe he was at the wedding this weekend.  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on there.  Yeah.  I have terrible news.  You know who else just died?  I just found this out just right now.  Uh-oh.  Do you guys know the Trelolo man?  Who?  The Trelolo man.  You guys know him.  This is a big deal.  Oh, that guy.  I remember this guy. 
[01:18:30]  I heard he was sick on Friday.  Oh, boy.  And we've lost a great man today.  That's the guy that walks into the scene.  Oh, we played this shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who is he?  I forget his name.  Edward Keel or something.  He's scary.  What did he die of?  Hopefully embarrassed.  This got 147 million views?  No, almost 15 million.  This one has 14 million. 
[01:19:00]  I'm sure there's more with many more millions.  Wow.  Can you put this on our Facebook page?  How old is this?  E-Roc's putting it on the Facebook page.  It's from, uh, 70s?  Okay.  We did a whole thing on this guy, I remember now.  He's great.  Yeah, he is great.  He had, like, a little comeback happening, too,  because this video exploded,  and then, you know, people kind of half-jokingly were like,  yeah, I'll pay to see Trilolo guy sing,  and then he tried to put, like, some comeback thing together.  I would love to see him. 
[01:19:30]  Well, you can't.  He's dead.  No, I mean, one of the comeback things he did before he died.  I mean, he would be a lot older than this clip.  So we lost Richard Dawson, 79?  70, how old?  79 years young.  79 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, I heard upwards of 20,000 women he probably kissed on the family feud.  Really?  He married one of them.  Yeah.  He married one of the contestants, huh?  Yeah, he absolutely did. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  This is him trying to redo it?  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, because that clip is like 37 years ago.  Looks like they found him in the middle of Russia somewhere.  Where the fuck is he?  Yeah, it's probably Russian.  Oh, it is?  Oh, all right.  How's that Russian look to it?  Yes, comrade.  So he's dead.  Yeah, it's a sad thing.  Magnetic tray.  Anything Russian just always goes back to Yakov's dumb trays. 
[01:20:30]  Jason Alexander in trouble, huh?  Not really.  What is this about?  Oh, he said something and used the word gay.  Not talking about, you know, the gay.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  But he decided, I guess, for a preemptive apology before any shenanigans even started.  Right.  No one knew that he said anything bad.  And doesn't he know you could say gay now?  But not when you're talking about something being gay unless they're gay people. 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  You can't say, hey, that's gay.  Oh, that game's gay.  Why?  Well, because you can't.  We were all brought up saying that.  I know.  Even, I'm sure gay people said that not meaning the other gay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just singing.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  That is just nonsense.  That guy was a weirdo.  His face was creepy. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Looks like a burnt guy.  He was scary guy.  No eyebrows.  Famous internet people always have a little creep on them.  Oh, yeah.  Creepy.  They're not staring at anything in particular, right?  Yeah.  They always have a weird fucking hairpiece or something.  That's why Chocolate Rain Guy was so great, because he looked fucking crazy, too.  Yeah.  Anything ever happen to that guy?  Chocolate Rain Guy?  Yeah.  He got an endorsement deal at Mountain Dew, so he got a nice payday for a minute.  And that was it.  Yeah.  Didn't he have a follow-up song, which just wasn't the same?  Yeah, I don't even remember. 
[01:22:00]  I don't either.  Here's Jason Alexander.  You ever played cricket?  I've watched cricket.  Cricket's an amazing game.  It's a gay game.  You should be able to say that.  And it gets a big laugh, especially on an entertainment show where everyone's just trying to be funny.  It gets a big laugh, of course.  There's a lot of people wearing white, a lot of people wearing white, people wearing helmets for no discernible reason.  People not wearing helmets that look like they should have a helmet.  Everybody breaks for tea in the middle, and they come on in there, and then you hit it, and you just kind of run back and forth without any rhyme or reason. 
[01:22:30]  It's a cross between baseball and don't nap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know how I know it's really kind of a gay game?  It's the pitch.  It looks like nothing.  It's a kind of a, if you slow it in slow motion, it's kind of a...  It's the weirdest.  It's not like a manly baseball pitch.  It's a queer British gay pitch. 
[01:23:00]  Did he say queer British gay pitch?  Wow, he really went off.  Yeah, he did.  A little more than...  Almost like a Kramer.  Wow.  There's a nigger over there.  Yeah, well, there's a faggot over here.  All we need now is Jerry and Elaine.  Oh, wow, these goddamn Jews!  I hate the Jews!  And, of course, who wouldn't Elaine like?  Who would Elaine not like?  We've got blacks, Jews, gays.  Who else?  The chinks. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, the chinks.  Probably the tards.  Oh, maybe that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could go with the R word.  Wow.  That's all we need is her and Jerry to go.  He took a little...  He might have taken it a little too far there, maybe.  Yeah, you know, he was feeling...  In this world, not for us.  He was feeling...  In this PC world of ours.  The laugh when he first said gay game.  Yeah.  Everyone, like, laughed.  So he thought, eh, let me keep going with that.  Yeah, that might be a little rough.  I'm a funny guy.  This dumb fucking PC world we live in.  Whoops. 
[01:24:00]  You're a Mets fan?  No, but I'm not, you know, I'm not a hate-the-Mets guy.  I used to be a Mets fan.  Got our first no-hitter.  Stupid me, I really thought the Mets had a no-hitter.  I just assumed.  You would have thought, with all the history of the Amazons, that they would have had one.  Travis taught me that Mets were one of two teams that didn't have a no-hitter.  Oh, the other one being...  I forgot what team he told me.  The Padres, I believe.  San Diego Padres, that's right.  He didn't say that. 
[01:24:30]  I can't believe.  This is how it went down over the weekend while we were at the wedding.  Yeah, well...  Johan sweeps a little dirt away from the left of the pitching rubber.  Steps behind the rubber.  Tugs once at the bill of his cap.  Takes a deep breath and steps to the third base side of the rubber.  Santana into the windup.  The payoff pitch on the way.  Swung out and missed!  Strike three!  He's done it!  Johan Santana has pitched a no-hitter in the 8,020th game in the history of the New York Mets! 
[01:25:00]  They finally have a no-hitter!  And who better to do it?  Can you stop that?  Because there's a story within the story.  Ah.  The Gary Carter guy rules.  He was just let out of jail last night.  He's a hardcore Mets fan and he couldn't help himself, he said.  And he ran out on the field in a Gary Carter jersey to join the celebration and he looked  like he was part of the team. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, shit.  But then quickly you realize he's not part of the team because they're basically beating  the shit out of him in front of the mound.  See the guy right there?  That just jumped into the pile?  Did you see him?  Oh, which guy?  Oh, that guy, right.  He was wearing shorts, too.  Yeah, that was the giveaway.  Where did he come from?  He just came in from the stands.  Look.  He jumps into the pile.  Everyone's cool.  And then they separate him from the pile.  Oh, yeah, and then they realize, hey, this isn't a...  No.  That's pretty funny. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  The guy just ran from the fuck in.  Oh, man, that's funny.  He's in the paper today.  He said he couldn't help himself.  He's been a longtime Mets fan.  How do they get him out of there?  They realize, though.  See, they're grabbing him out of there.  There he is right there.  And they're going to go to a wide shot where he's getting the shit beat out of him in front  of the celebration.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What an asshole.  Fucking wrestle him to the ground.  That's fucking funny. 
[01:26:30]  I love it.  He couldn't help himself.  He couldn't help himself.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's great.  Oh, man.  And they're pulling him off the fucking field.  He got arrested.  What is that, like a night or two in jail?  Yeah, it's...  Yeah, yeah.  Especially since you just saw...  He didn't do anything.  They might give you two nights for that.  I don't know.  And then later on, SNY also aired an unidentified Mets penis in the...  They identified it?  Unidentified.  Oh, I'll...  Danny, if you go to Deadspin, you can watch the video.  Oh, yeah, no one...  Identified it. 
[01:27:00]  I'll get to the bottom of this.  No one wants to claim responsibility because it's kind of a...  It's not.  It's just an okay penis.  It's an out-of-the-shower.  It's lacking a little bit, so that's why no one is claiming responsibility.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he did just get out of the shower, right?  And for the golf fans, Tiger Woods had an amazing fucking day yesterday.  As we find the other clip.  Deadspin's saying it might be Ike Davis.  Oh, really?  But weren't they...  Who were they interviewing at the time?  Because it just worked out perfectly.  Dickie...  Who the fuck... 
[01:27:30]  It's in the clip.  Dickie.  I forget.  I'm tired today.  You got it?  Yeah, here it is.  Who were they interviewing?  Does it say...  R.A. Dickie.  Yeah.  See how it always works out?  Jim, what?  Watch.  You'll see the fucking guy walk in.  There's his penis.  Hey, hey, hey.  His little dick.  Ew.  The showers must have been ice cold.  That's horrible.  Oh, that's bad.  You don't want that one.  That's horrible. 
[01:28:00]  Wow.  What a terrible penis.  Whose dick is that?  You don't want that put out there for the people to see.  It's a great screen cap, too, because it looks like he's just staring.  His eyeline is lined up right with the dick.  Oh, is that great?  That's the fuck bubble.  Fucking hilarious.  Fuck bubble.  That is funny, man.  Just walking by in the background.  That's sad.  Oh, what a little, little guy. 
[01:28:30]  There's absolutely no presentation whatsoever.  No, it's literally resting on top of his ball bag.  Right.  So it's good.  God.  The entire penis.  That's horrible.  With his fucking, like a Civil War cannon.  Jesus.  And his awful croc shoes.  Right.  His crocs.  Oh, man.  That's a bad dick.  Can we throw that on Facebook?  Or no?  Does the nudity tell us?  We can throw the link up.  All right, yeah.  Throw the link up on our Facebook page for the people that haven't seen the Opie and Anthony 
[01:29:00]  on Facebook.  Wow.  So first time in 51 years.  So the Padres are the only team, huh?  Yes.  And there's already controversy because there was a blown call that Carlos Beltran should have  had a base hit.  Uh-oh.  Really?  Against Johan, yeah.  Yeah, he hit a ball that was called foul, but it hit the chalk, so technically it is  fair.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  Yeah, throw him a bum.  No, man, because it worked the other way for that poor guy that had the perfect game 
[01:29:30]  with the blown call at first.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that guy that no one talks about anymore because he didn't get the perfect game?  Because he didn't get the perfect game.  You don't know his name.  Armando Galarraga.  Oh, look at you.  Only hardcore baseball fans know that.  He would have been mainstream if he got that perfect game.  Stupid umpire blowing that fucking call.  Yeah, he really dicked that guy over.  That's in first place, too, huh?  Yeah, apparently they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's only, you know... 
[01:30:00]  You following your Yankees?  How many games left?  Well, not as much as I should.  Yeah.  I'll be honest.  It's all right.  They're not going anywhere.  That's not a good fucking beginning of it.  Well, good news for the Mets fans.  Bill Maher is now a part owner.  Part owner.  Well, that's like...  A minority stake.  A minority stake in it.  But they're trying to get out from under their Bernie Madoff fucking disaster.  So they're letting anybody buy shares in the Mets, but they don't have any decision making.  Or, you know, they're not allowed to do anything. 
[01:30:30]  Nah, it's just a...  I don't even know if he gets good seats.  Do you get good seats if you invest?  He's probably got to pay for them, still.  Yeah.  See?  Probably.  He doesn't need it.  Yeah.  We need the money.  All right.  Let's break, and when we get back, we got 911 calls from Miami.  The face-eating guy.  Ah.  We got 911 calls.  Did you see the 18-minute video that Gawker put up?  No, I...  We didn't talk about it last week, did we?  The only thing I saw was security cam footage.  We could only see, like, feet sticking out.  You couldn't see anything.  Yeah.  But you know what's going on there. 
[01:31:00]  That's what made that creepy.  Oh, were the feet kicking?  It was 18 minutes of him just eating his face.  Can you see that?  Not really.  Because, like you said, it's a security camera.  It's far away.  I think the big story there is just that now we know that it was 18 minutes.  18 minutes.  He's a slow eater, though.  But what does it take for someone to notice?  I'm sure the guy's screaming bloody murder.  You'll hear these 911 calls.  It's just people saying, yeah, you know, these two guys are doing something.  And, you know, there's two naked guys.  It's so weird. 
[01:31:30]  Where are they in this shot?  Probably right in that green square.  Where?  Oh, there they are, right.  Where?  Down under the bridge.  Oh, over there.  Yeah.  Are they fighting right there?  No one notices these two are fighting on the side of the road?  Who would care, you know?  It's just creepy.  Is he ripping his clothes off or?  Oh, man.  The guy's taking his clothes off.  See?  He's just yanking his clothes off.  He's like, I'm getting naked and now I'm going to eat your face.  I'm going to get you naked. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  What's going on?  I don't know, man.  What's wrong with these people?  The cars are just driving by.  The guy's fighting for his life.  He's fighting for his life right there.  People are trying to figure out if that's their exit or not.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  Punching him?  The guy's punching him?  Yeah, he's punching him in the face.  Yeah, see, you can see.  That's disturbing.  For the most part.  God, and then he just starts chewing on his face.  Oh, I was moving him around a lot.  Was he sucking his dick?  Where do you start when you, like, you got to start a face? 
[01:32:30]  I think cheeks.  Cheeks are so pinchable.  See, I would say lips.  I'd go for a lip.  Oh, lip?  Yeah.  Because it's got like a little, a lip.  Yeah, you might be right.  It's got a lip on it.  It's got a lip on it.  A lip.  It's got a lip.  I bet you could bite right through a lip, too.  You line up those teeth just right.  Oh, yeah.  I bet you could fuck it up real good, too.  Fuck yeah.  Like, you get the lip off completely, and you're like, God damn it.  I was trying to peel this fucking face off.  Now I got to go for the other one.  Ow.  Then what, do you go cheek?  And then chin?  I think eyebrow.  You can get like a good...  Eyebrow?  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, good grip on that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And just rip it right the fuck off.  But the cheek would be the best meat.  A chin.  How about a chin, too?  The chin.  You could really get a lot.  Yeah.  You could get your mouth around it, bite it right off.  You'd leave the nose alone, right?  That's got to be shitty meat.  Well, I would.  I wouldn't want to...  Like, I don't...  I don't like when you...  You've thought about that.  Well, yeah, look.  If you're going to eat a face, you've got to think about it.  I don't like cartilage.  And when I bite into some chicken, or you get like a bad piece of fucking...  Like a KFC, and you get that cartilage.  Yeah.  I hate that.  I bet a nose... 
[01:33:30]  And the nose is nothing but that.  I bet the nose has something in it like the plastic shit and the king crab legs.  Oh.  I feel like you bite it, and you've got to spit out that clear plastic shit.  You've got to spit out boogers and fucking hair.  Who wants to chomp away on a nose?  He's still...  Yeah, nose hairs and snot.  The eyelid would be like chicken skin.  No real meat to it.  Now he's dragging him under the bridge.  He's dragging him.  All right.  He's dragging him so he can eat him.  Yeah, that sucks, because they sort of move out of the security camera.  But he could still see some action. 
[01:34:00]  Do you think he left the bottom of his face because he had like a beard?  He had a beard.  It's probably bad, yeah.  You don't want hair in your mouth.  You don't need bum beard.  Bum beard.  Bum cheeks are bad enough, but bum beard has a lot of bugs and shit trapped in it.  Yeah, that's why he can't eat the chin, because there's hair under the skin always.  So you don't want that.  You've got to go cheeks, lips, lower lip.  You hope the guy passed out.  You hope the guy was unconscious before he started getting bitten.  Yeah, he was.  I mean, I think the beating really took him out.  Yeah, I took him out.  I hope so. 
[01:34:30]  His face is really bad.  Yeah, I think I read something that he only started coming to when he was being hauled  off by the paramedics.  Did the guy get his eye?  So.  I saw one of them in the picture.  I don't know.  That doesn't mean that the other one's not there.  I just didn't see it.  You can eat my face.  Just leave my eyes alone so I can still see shit.  Because to me, I wouldn't know any different.  It's like, how do I look?  I wouldn't care.  I would still see the same.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, and then you've got to look in the mirror.  Oh, no.  You get rid of the fucking mirrors right away.  Get rid of all the mirrors in your house? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  You wouldn't know.  No.  Look through your eyes right now.  You don't know what you look like.  No, but you'd know when you see people's faces go.  It's just horrified.  That's why the chimp attack or whatever.  Yeah.  What's really depressing about that is that the damn thing took her eyes.  Yeah.  Because she would have still seen the same.  Been able to see.  Yeah.  But does she want to?  Yes, you'd want to still be able to see shit.  I don't know.  Of course you would.  Could at least enjoy a movie still. 
[01:35:30]  All right, we'll do the 911 calls next.  And then it's a lot of guests on the show today.  Anthony Bourdain at 8.30.  Paul Williams at 9 o'clock.  And Uriah Faber at 9.30.  Stay there.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  Do you want me to do this?  Do you want me to do this?  On Sirius XM.  CBS News, Serene Branson is live at the Staples Center.  Serene.  Well, a very, very heavy, heavy-dirtation tonight.  We had a very Darrison fight.  Let's go ahead.  Terry's in those for a bit. 
[01:36:00]  They had the pen.  We had a very, very heavy-dirtation.  We had a very heavy-dirtation.  We had a very, very-dirtation tonight.  We had a very Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Fight, let's go ahead.  Darrison tonight.  We had a very, very-darrison. 
[01:36:30]  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Fight, let's go ahead.  Darrison tonight.  We had a very, very-darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison. 
[01:37:00]  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Darrison.  Ah, it's time for a little story about two fellas broin' down.  Sam is my bro. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, technically, I'm on vacation.  And Troy, you said yourself, if you're not in Cleveland to party, you shouldn't be in Cleveland.  Ha ha.  And when the party is broin' down in Cleveland, you know what's poppin' off.  If you're sitting here naked with your dick out, you're cool, all right?  Yeah, whatever.  All right, cool.  We on vacation, baby.  And boys will be boys.  Sam, go ahead and stick your finger in my butthole.  But all foreplay, all the time, makes Jack a dull boy.  Feel me? 
[01:38:00]  Slow that shit down for a second.  I'm 34 years old, man.  I know how to pace myself.  Dude, you're fucking awesome at this.  You're doing really well.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, yeah.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Fuck yeah, bro. 
[01:38:30]  Smash that ass.  Broin' down in Cleveland.  The only way we know how.  Dude, you should teach a fucking class.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Series action.  Series action.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  The guy is still getting his face eaten. 
[01:39:00]  Oh!  Yeah.  Danny pointed out.  Danny goes, by the way, you know, we went to break with the video of the guy getting his  face eaten, and I never put it on pause.  So that whole time where you were doing whatever, since the last time we were talking live, that  entire time the guy's been eating that homeless man's face.  Oh, the guy's face.  Just to give you an idea of how long 18 minutes is, just to give you an idea of how long 18 minutes  is of getting your face eaten.  And it's still going.  Especially if your face is getting eaten, that's a long 18. 
[01:39:30]  Do you think that time goes faster or slower when you're having your face eaten?  It's got to be so slow.  It doesn't zip by.  Yeah.  It's got to be real slow.  Would you go forehead meat?  Well, there's nothing there.  Yeah.  You've got to tear at it.  Yeah.  That's like working a wingette.  A wingette.  Yeah.  Or a winglet.  What did I fuck that up?  A winglet.  Yeah, a wingette.  I got it, though.  It made me laugh.  Anthony Bourdain is coming down the hall.  We should ask him about the tasty part of the face.  All right.  Yes.  He would know. 
[01:40:00]  This Anthony Bourdain is going to be a fucking star.  Yep.  He already is on the Travel Channel, but he's going to turn this CNN around.  And we have a Marine watching outside.  He's a very nice guy I met in D.C.  You want to bring them in?  I don't care.  We don't have time.  Maybe at the end.  We don't have time at the moment.  No, I mean so they can see better.  There's a room.  Anthony Bourdain back on the show.  How you doing?  How you doing, man?  What's up, bro?  There he is.  How you doing, man?  Good, good.  Real good.  Get you with your graphic novel.  This is the first copy.  You haven't even seen it. 
[01:40:30]  I haven't seen it fully bound and fully colored.  Really?  So it's a good morning.  Quickly, I want to say you filmed your last No Reservations?  Just the other day.  Because you're in the paper today.  You're in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Last episode.  Last ever?  Ever.  Wow.  And the last scene, actually one of the last scenes was, we were shooting with Michael  Quay White.  Yeah, I know.  We love The Wire.  Michael K. Williams.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:41:00]  Michael K. Williams.  I'm like a total super geeky fan of The Wire.  Oh, yeah.  And we're sitting there, middle of the scene, shooting with him.  And Jamie Hector, who plays Marlo, walks by.  Just a sort of geek inferno.  Yeah, right?  I loved it.  We've had all those guys on the show.  They're so nice.  So cool.  His charity is actually this week, Jamie Hector.  Yeah, Hector.  That's right.  This Saturday.  They do this paintball thing for kids.  And I forget the name of the charity.  We'll plug it later in the week. 
[01:41:30]  But I saw that photo of you with Omar and Marlo.  That's a great shot.  Moving Mountains, it's called.  Oh, moving out.  That's right.  Very good.  And actually, I'm not able to make it this weekend, but I'm hoping to organize a crew  of celebrity chefs to join up next year.  I think the idea of the cast of The Wire chasing a bunch of overweight chefs around  would be really the paintballs would be really fun.  Yeah, we went last year.  Was it last year?  Last year.  The year before?  No, last year we went.  No, it was a lot of fun.  It was really a lot of fun.  And it's funny.  Michael K. Williams, as tough as Omar was, I see him six months after that, and he's 
[01:42:00]  like, that well lasted for so long.  I was complaining about paintball weld.  You know that show's 10 years old already?  Yeah.  10th anniversary just passed.  Jesus.  Before we move on to your newer projects, so what are we going to see on the last No Reservations?  I hear you're just eating corned beef.  That's easy.  That's easy stuff.  Brooklyn, which is, in a lot of ways, a foreign country for me.  I mean, I spent the last, I don't know, since I'm 17 in Manhattan, born there, since I got 
[01:42:30]  out of a kid.  I mean, my whole world was about the size of this room for most of my work in life.  I never got out much at all working in kitchens.  And then when things changed for me, I was all everywhere else in the world but my hometown.  So I thought it was only right to look at it like in another country.  I had an amazing time.  What are the circumstances of the end here?  Your decision?  I'm moving to CNN. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  But the papers say today that the Travel Channel was surprised by this announcement.  That they were a little surprised, too.  Well, you know, what can I tell you?  I met a nicer guy.  It happens.  Are you kidding me?  We would leave for a nicer guy.  Yeah, please.  If someone called us, our contract's up soon.  If someone's calling and they're a nicer guy, we're out of here.  It was a real surprise to me.  I mean, CNN, they're a news organization.  I didn't expect to get a call from them. 
[01:43:30]  I definitely didn't expect them to...  I mean, I had a really good couple of meetings.  They really understood what the show was about.  We sent them the most difficult and seriously messed up, dysfunctional shows we've ever done.  You know, the Christmas special, the black and white Rome show we did.  You know, just to say, listen, do you realize what you're getting into?  Do you know who we are?  Have you seen the show?  They liked the show for all the right reasons.  We wanted to bring the whole production team over.  Same shooters, same editors, same everybody. 
[01:44:00]  My people I've been working with for 10 years.  And they're opening up the world in a way that, you know, few other people could do.  I mean, we want to go up the Congo River, which is something I haven't been able to do for security reasons.  I'm guessing, you know, if anybody can make that happen, I can make it happen.  Now, you own the show because it's weird that you can bring the name with you and everything over to the network.  No, no, no, I'm not bringing the name with you.  Oh, you're not?  Okay, you're bringing the name with you.  It's obviously going to be the same show, more or less.  I mean, I'm not morphing into Wolf Blitzer here. 
[01:44:30]  That's not what I do.  No situation room?  My audience would like it.  No video screens?  Yeah, well, you know what?  A lot of people were confused.  They're like, wait, Anthony Bourdain's going over there to do a talk show or something and just interview people?  It's like, now we're learning, no, that's not the case.  I'm not going to go over and do some ball-less version of the show.  But by the same token, I'm not going to, you know, I'm not morphing into a political pundit either.  Gotcha.  Very cool.  Do you know when it's going to air?  Next year.  Next year.  Oh, okay.  We start shooting this fall, late autumn.  And, you know, a lot of places that I've been meaning to go to for a long time. 
[01:45:00]  I've been trying to get into Libya.  Wow.  Really?  You know, there are a lot of things that I...  Who would want to go to Libya?  Apparently, even before Gaddafi was caught, I was getting, you know, we work as security guys now and again.  And a really interesting group of former SAS officers who work with us in hot zones.  And they're a fun bunch, really bright, really interesting.  And some of them, when they're not working for us, they're doing other things for various entities. 
[01:45:30]  Let's put it that way.  Sure.  Okay.  They're for hire.  We're getting...  I'll get the government.  Government.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, we're getting texts from within Libya during the revolution there.  And they're saying, it's awesome here.  Dude, the Italian food in Benghazi is great.  All these kids are doing anti-Gaddafi rap.  There's a whole sort of anti-Gaddafi rap scene going on.  It's a really exciting time in history.  And the food's good.  You know, we wanted to do that show.  Maybe, you know, next time we will. 
[01:46:00]  Are you ever scared?  I mean, what you just described sounds kind of awesome.  But then you think in your head, but it's a scary place.  Well, boredom scares me.  You know, doing the same sort of...  Must be petrified right now.  Going to Romania again scares me.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because we have a friend that travels the world.  He's Jimmy's guy, manager.  And he goes to crazy West African countries. 
[01:46:30]  And where else has he been?  He said he's gotten really sick eating in...  I don't know.  It might have been around Timbuktu or something.  It was like...  He ate like...  Or Ethiopia.  There's like raw meat outside that they eat.  And he said it was covered in flies.  And you eat some.  And that got him very, very sick.  I mean, I've been really ill twice.  Both times I had a pretty good idea going in.  That, you know, it was old.  Less than fresh.  And it was a tribal situation where everybody's looking at me.  A lot of honor and prestige is involved. 
[01:47:00]  And, you know, I'm the honored guest.  And you got to take one for the team.  How long were you sick for when you ate that?  What was it, meat?  Two days of serious crawling around on my hands and knees praying.  And, you know...  I would just tell him...  I'm not a religious man.  I would tell him, my mom said, when in doubt, throw it out.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  They don't get sick for it?  Yeah, that's what I was...  Yeah.  They didn't get sick, but you did.  No, I mean, listen.  The countries where they've got nothing, you know, you go in and you just look at the meat  section of the market and you're thinking, oh, you know, dude, oh, this is not going 
[01:47:30]  to be good.  Yeah.  But those are also sometimes the places where, you know, the most amazing things happen.  And then again, you know, you never know.  You know, I've eaten in places where I thought the food was going to be really bad and it ended  up being really great.  So, I don't know.  I just...  The world's a big place.  A lot of cool stuff in it.  And I'm having fun.  Was that meat cooked that you got sick from or no?  Cooked is sort of a...  Yeah, more or less.  They heat it up a little bit for you?  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  Couldn't you get it well done and just say, I just got it.  No pink?  No pink.  It's not going to help.  Oh, no?  What was the meat, by the way?  One time it was a warthog and the other time it was bush meat.  You know, just, you know, whatever they can get.  God knows what it is.  Yeah.  Wow.  A bit gamey.  A bit.  Yeah.  Like when Zimmern always starts...  It's mineral.  It has a mineral component.  I think that means it's...  Wow.  Right?  And how much did you eat?  Just enough to be polite, but enough to hit the jackpot.  And how long after did you start, like, oh, boy? 
[01:48:30]  You know, within 12 hours.  It's generally about 12 hours.  It's sort of a joke on the show, actually.  We're, you know, when we're sitting around with a crew and somebody makes, you know, particularly  in hotels in a developing country, you know, somebody will order, like, the egg salad off  the room service menu where, you know, we're sitting by the pool and, you know, interior  of Ghana and someone's ordering, like, paella and all the rest of the crew will all look  at our watches and go, mark time.  Yeah.  Check back in 12 hours and see if he's shitting himself. 
[01:49:00]  We'll put vets down, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Do you travel with anything in case you get sick?  You have to have something with you, like...  Yeah.  Uh, you know, but what could...  There's only so much you could do.  Sometimes you just got to puke and shit it out until you...  That's pretty much the program, yeah.  But everyone wants his...  You've got the greatest job.  I...  Honestly, the...  It's the best.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's the best job in the world.  We have a lot of fun and there are a lot of moments, even if it's a tough shoot, you  know, they're almost all the time, there's at least one day on the shoot where me and 
[01:49:30]  the crew, we've, you know, we finish shooting for the day, you know, you're out in the  Sahara someplace, you're hanging out with some Berber dudes or something, and you climb  up...  You know, at the end of the day, you climb up a dune, you know, smoke a joint, look out  at the Sahara, the moon dropping into the dunes, and you're thinking, this is not such  this.  Who gets to do this, you know?  Well, and I'm psyched that you're continuing with CNN, because I honestly didn't know what  type of show you were going to do for them, so that's great.  They've been very, very, very cool. 
[01:50:00]  That's awesome.  And there are a lot of...  You know, I'm obsessed with Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now, and so they're going up the  Congo River and retracing that whole history while we see the countries.  Wow.  You know, that's the big company for me.  The big get.  Are you going to have to relocate or anything?  No.  Move to Atlanta?  No.  I could live anywhere to make this show.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, I think also they're going to be asking me regularly for commentary, but  you know, I'm not going to be talking election results here.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, if they outlaw Olestra, I guess I'll be called on. 
[01:50:30]  You're the guy.  The seepage problem.  You're the guy.  Go to, yeah.  Well, we got a mayor outlawing large sugary drinks.  Yeah, how do you feel about that?  It's the dumbest thing ever.  Really?  Oh, you like it?  I'm a libertarian by instinct.  I really think it's horrifying to me on a cellular level, the idea that the government  would have to step in and tell you, you can't eat that, you can't eat that.  But, I mean, look at us, you know. 
[01:51:00]  I mean, I was having this argument with Ted Nugent.  It's like, you know, it's a military readiness issue at this point.  You know, move away from the drink.  I mean, I think it's a readiness issue.  I mean, there's giant gulps of, they did it.  They had no problem.  You know, when I smoked, they had no problem, you know, taxing me up to, what, $13 a pack,  of which, like, 95% was taxed.  They had no problem shoving me out of my favorite bar, restaurant, place of, you know,  every place that I could possibly smoke, and then moving me down the street and demonizing 
[01:51:30]  me and ghettoizing me in every possible way.  Now you've got to go underground, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty much.  So, you know, as far as health insurance, all the rest, I was, you know, smokers were  whack.  Well, you know, obesity is a much more destructive, provably much more expensive to the country  and physically destructive.  And, you know, again, you know, to put it in terms that even Ted Nugent relates to, you  know, we've got a lot of enemies in this world.  We might need to raise an army at some point, you know.  So, uh, how big a soda do you need? 
[01:52:00]  Boosies and cigarettes affect other people, though.  Like, secondhand smoke and drunk driving affect the pump.  So there's more of a reason to attack that.  By the way, I defer.  We're running out of a burning building together.  You're clogging my exit.  That's a good point.  Although, the fat guy will be left behind, so that's one less person I have to deal with  at the exits, because I'll run right by his big fat.  You're a first class on the plane.  Of course I am.  First landing.  Oh, man.  Right, right.  You're an obstruction.  Get off the plane and the plane's on fire.  I think in a patriotic America, every citizen should aspire to, like, if you hear your 
[01:52:30]  neighbor cry out an alarm, you should be able to get up off the couch in good order  and reasonably quickly to grab your weapon and get over there to help your neighbor out.  Indeed.  Fair enough.  That's a patriotic way of thinking.  But you think they'll stop drinking all their, that much soda?  Just because they banned the large cups?  Listen, I hate the whole idea.  Don't get me wrong.  I really do.  But I, you look at these giant things.  How big a soda do you need?  And some things ought to be done.  And we've clearly proven with smoking that the more difficult and expensive you make 
[01:53:00]  for people, the less they're going to smoke.  I mean, eventually it became so much hard.  It became harder for me to smoke than to quit, which is pretty hard.  I mean, I found myself crouched, you know, on the 20th floor of my building in the service  area, you know, sneaking a cigarette because I couldn't smoke around my kid.  And I was caught by the building manager.  I'm, you know, I felt like a high school student, you know, I'm like in my 50s.  And it's like, oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Neal Meyer. 
[01:53:30]  I won't do it again.  It was just so humiliating.  So maybe if they, you know, everyone needs to be caught in the service area, they're building  with like a big gulp of Mountain Dew, you know, a bag of Cheetos.  They should just cut funding for insurance.  Like after a certain amount of obesity, we shouldn't cover it.  That's it.  Fuck you.  If you're going to keep eating.  Like, I agree with you.  I just don't think the government can tell you you can't do it.  Once you decide to do it, we shouldn't pay for it.  Yeah.  When you say how much soda is enough, it's as much as I fucking want.  Yeah.  That's pretty much how it should be.  But it should.  Exactly.  But there's got to be personal responsibility. 
[01:54:00]  You're taking up two seats on the subway.  Now it's beyond a personal liberty problem, really.  I mean, I'm not talking about, you know, a world where everybody should aspire to be thin  by any means, but I think there's some middle ground here where your crap is floating downstream  in somebody else's property.  I do agree with you in some respects, but I really, that whole thing with the government  stepping in and saying you can't do something, it really does get me. 
[01:54:30]  And especially when it's something like that.  It's not something like, okay, I really would like to own automatic weapons, but they've told  me, I cannot, you know, I'll say all right for that for now.  But like soda, please, can you just get out of my fucking ass?  Listen, like I said, I really hate it.  But look at us.  I mean, diabetes, type 2 diabetes is at epidemic levels. 
[01:55:00]  It's like four or five times what it was just 20 years ago.  One in seven kids is going to have.  Yeah.  We're talking to a country that in 20 years is going to be predominantly obese, according  to the current thinking.  You know, this is no joke.  We're fat, sick, and weak.  The commies will be all over us.  There'll be Canadians pouring across the border and raping our families on our living room  floors, and we're going to be too big to do anything about it.  You think they'll go after restaurants also, with some of the things they serve? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, that's funny.  Some of the plates they serve.  Here's where I get totally hypocritical.  Well, because, you know, they're banning the large cups in some of these restaurants,  but you could buy an entree that's over 2,000 calories.  Bloomberg has already talked about limiting salt and making restaurants.  He's raised the possibility of telling chefs how much salt they can use.  I hate salt in my food, by the way.  That's where I turn around on a dime and become a complete hypocrite.  Yeah, because you're not going to say you can't order two steaks, 
[01:56:00]  or you can't order two cream puffs, or whatever it is for dessert.  Like, you can't.  Once you start regulating what people do, as much as I hate obesity, and it really does.  I agree with you.  Theoretically, I hate it.  It annoys me, and your shit's floating downstream.  I completely agree.  The government just can't fucking tell you you can only have so much soda.  Portions are, like, four times what they were 30 years ago.  We're eating, like, five times as much chicken.  You know, our idea of what a normal meal is is so completely distorted from what it used to be  and from what they eat in the rest of the world. 
[01:56:30]  I mean, they look at us and the rest of the world like we're out of our minds.  We're slobs.  We really are.  You know, I like eating.  I do it for a living.  I eat excess for a living.  Yeah.  But I believe there is a point that I think a lot of people, you know, who are heavy would agree with you.  There's a point at which you're not actually enjoying your food anymore.  You're eating for other reasons.  How do you keep the weight off with all the eating?  Clean living.  I don't snack.  I mean, if I know I'm eating a big, huge meal tonight, I'm not sitting around with a bag of Cheetos. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  You know?  You're saving your calories.  I'm just saving the real estate for something that's going to give me what I'm pretty sure is going to make me, you know, happy for the maximum period of time.  You know, I don't go to the gym.  I'm not, like, working out.  I'm not jogging.  I would hate to live in a world where that was obligatory.  But, you know, if it's taking you a long time, I think the line is if it's taking you an unreasonable amount of time to get out of your car, you know, this is not an alternate lifestyle choice. 
[01:57:30]  This is a health problem, and we should help you with it.  We shouldn't demonize you for it, but we should help you.  I wonder if there's another way to do that, though, instead of just banning the large cups.  I just think people are going to find their soft drinks.  It's a weird thing.  It's almost like saying you can't have Miller Lite because there's so many things.  You can have Bud Light.  You can have Schlitz or any other beer or Old English, but you can't have Miller Lite.  It's such a minor thing that it's not going to do much good. 
[01:58:00]  But we do that already.  You can have Miller Lite, but you can't have Four Loko.  Do you think that people drinking to excess is way worse than people drinking sugary drinks?  But we're not going to take that on because that's a whole fucking can of worms telling people they're drinking too much.  I think that causes way more problems than...  No, I think we just make it...  I mean, right now, where do you get big, giant drinks?  In convenience stores. 
[01:58:30]  He's trying to make it less convenient.  But what about the movie theater?  Because I think that's the one place where this really pisses me off because it's just like,  look, if I want to go to a movie theater to see a movie, I'm going to have a big old thing of popcorn,  and I'm going to have a 16-ounce soda that's going to last me for two hours and 20 minutes  while I'm eating this big salty thing of popcorn.  Now I've got to miss part of the movie to get another drink.  To go back up and get another drink.  That's where I'm at with this.  That's where you draw the line.  It's a really big issue because actually they don't make money on movies.  To make money on concessions.  The only way they make the money, and it's probably not so much on the hot dogs, 
[01:59:00]  it's on those giant supersized beverages which cost around three cents a piece.  So that's hitting the theater owners.  Sure, and I commiserate with the theater owners because I understand how the process works  and where the money goes, and it really sucks to have a movie theater in this world.  It sucks because you've got to play by the rules.  And when you're taking nickels and dimes out of the owner's pockets over some soda,  I mean, it stinks, and it's really affecting economies, personal economies.  I have to say I really resent paying like $22 for an overpriced, for a big soda. 
[01:59:30]  I do, but you know what?  It's not the movie theater's fault, though.  You should blame George Lucas.  I do.  Blame Universal Pictures.  No problem so far.  Because those are the ones that are taking, you know, 100% of an opening weekend box office.  For Transformers 7.  Exactly.  So what's the problem here?  Fine.  Maybe they'll be forced to make movies that we like.  I haven't seen a movie I liked in a while.  It's been a while.  I'm scared, though, because I'm thinking now we're going to reach a point where foodies  are going to start sneaking food into theaters, and that's really the worst case scenario. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, man.  Some motherfucker sitting next to you, like, you know, making cheese fondue, you know.  And she had chowing down on something that stinks.  Eating something like a pita sandwich, you know, loaded with something either really  good or really bad.  Either one would be worse.  I sneak in healthy snacks when I take in a movie.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like.  He likes dates in his pocket.  He'll have a pocket full of dates.  A pocket full of dates with not even a baggie.  But you know what?  They can either help obesity.  How about they give tax breaks to healthier places, like, or whatever, because.  That'd be nice.  When I'm in an airport, I travel a lot. 
[02:00:30]  It's impossible to not eat, like, shit, because everything in the airport is awful.  You know, like, one salad place and 40 McDonald's, which, again, the economy dictates that's what  people buy.  Right.  Then the economy should dictate it.  Yeah.  But they should give a tax break to another place so there's an incentive for them to  be in the airport so they can make money.  How about a tax break for a panini press that doesn't smell like the airport, you know.  I want to tell you what Jimmy said.  I like to eat healthy.  It's really hard.  On the road.  It's really.  It's easy in New York.  Especially on the road, but it's really hard.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, I don't even know what, eating healthy, I don't know whether I'm for that, but I think  tax breaks if you're, I don't know.  It's a way of encouraging a certain business, and again, they're going to lose money to  McDonald's and Burger King every time, but it gives them a way to stay above water, and  you're not forcing the public to do anything.  And since we do pay for it financially in insurance, well, it's going to come out financially  anyway, so that's a tax break.  I don't think that works.  I don't think positive reinforcement works.  I think negative reinforcement works.  You pass false rumors that there's rat feces. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, that would work.  That it causes penile shrinkage, or brain aneurysms.  That's effective.  I hate using, when the IRS is used, to do anything that coerces people into something.  It's not what it was supposed to fucking be there for.  It's the government blackmailing you when the IRS...  How do they afford to serve a Big Mac for a dollar?  That's the other side of the coin.  They're giving tax breaks to people to... 
[02:02:00]  You know, they're basically, the government is subsidizing big agriculture to kill us.  I don't like that at all.  I can't stand it.  But I'm with you.  Yeah, I'm for psychological warfare and demonizing and mockery.  Making people feel that it's uncool to do something is good, too.  I want to go back to the rat thing for a second, and then I want to talk about your book here.  But the government allows certain stuff to end up in our food, right?  You know a little bit about that?  Yeah.  Like rat feces and cockroach parts?  Well, always and forever, a certain... 
[02:02:30]  I mean, if you're cranking out tons of ground meat a day out of any facility, there is going  to be a small amount of stuff you don't want in there.  So there are federal standards.  Because they know they can't totally keep it out.  Yeah.  So they'll allow a mouse that will get ground up or something.  Well, they just try to spread them.  If they find too much mouse in one burger, they try to spread it out among many burgers  until it's an acceptable level.  Generally speaking, I mean, that's the way it works. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, one mouse hair per 100 pounds of meat, I could certainly live without it.  It's probably, on balance, cleaner than something any of our moms would make us in a home kitchen.  So that doesn't alarm me.  Right.  Is there ever...  Every time I see a roach in a restaurant, I don't want to eat there.  But in New York, it's almost unrealistic to think that every restaurant doesn't have it  on some level.  It's a constant war against them.  I mean, most responsible restaurants, especially these days, will build them out. 
[02:03:30]  It's a constant war.  So you're fighting them.  You build them out?  What's that mean?  Meaning you seal your points of possible access and you seal up every little bit of food and  you handle your food in such a way that the omnipresent problem...  There will be cockroaches if you don't maintain constant vigilance.  You know, leave it alone.  Ignore the situation for a week and you will have the cockroaches.  But you can't keep kitchens spotless.  It's almost impossible.  You can if you...  Yeah, pretty much you have to these days. 
[02:04:00]  You know, most of the places I know, they're really...  It's a constant fight.  You seal out.  You keep your food.  You know, you don't provide food for them.  Right.  So they completely clean the place out every night.  And if you don't, then you will have problems.  What do you think about the rating system here in New York?  I hated it initially because I just thought it was going to destroy the business.  It's hypocritical, meaning you're not allowed to have room-temperate food that's not at  certain high temperatures or low temperatures. 
[02:04:30]  If you're a good restaurant, you know, if you're a three-star restaurant, they'll come in  and they'll, you know, whack you hard and put you in the newspaper for leaving a block  of cheese out for longer than an hour.  Cheese is going to take days to go bad.  Right.  So it's not a threat.  Pizzerias everywhere in the city, they got pizza sitting out.  In the open, you know, at room temperature for hours.  Right.  They don't apply the law.  Of course, if they did apply the law evenly, there would be no pizza in New York.  But I'm not suggesting they do. 
[02:05:00]  But on balance, I hate the 80s.  I don't want to know if a place is an A, B, or a C.  Some of the best meals of my life have been in, you know, D's, D restaurants.  I find myself searching out the A's.  I don't know why.  Really?  I don't notice.  I'll say this.  Restaurants are cleaner and cooks are better educated about handling food.  So I guess, again, on balance, I'm coming around to like it.  But I don't want to think about that when I go in.  Yeah, it's true.  Is the food good?  I don't care if there's a sleeping dog on the floor.  Yeah.  And I don't care. 
[02:05:30]  I got you.  I kind of agree with you on that one.  Is the food good?  Yeah.  In fact, the dirtier you're looking in the dining room, the more confident they must be about  the food, I think, sometimes.  I like one thing Bloomberg did that I really like, though, is like in chain restaurants,  they have to list calories next to everything.  Like in Starbucks, they have to next to like those little cakes.  And I'm like, 400 for that?  So it actually has helped me stop eating a lot of shit.  I used to eat all the Starbucks cakes.  I don't eat them anymore.  I would see low fat and go, oh, this is healthy.  Oh, yeah.  Low fat's still 800 calories or whatever it is.  So, yeah, that I kind of like. 
[02:06:00]  It's affected the way people eat, apparently, like zero.  I mean, all of that calorie and ingredient information has changed habits.  Zero.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  That's what I think is to make you feel better about yourself.  But that's what I'm thinking with the soda.  I really think that it's not going to affect a lot of people.  You don't walk an extra two blocks for your soda or buy an extra, you know, haul an extra  two small bottles.  But the mayor does it, and then the next day he promotes donuts.  Donuts.  And he's eating a BLT.  We thought it was hilarious. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  It was donut day the next day after he came out with the big sugar drink.  Yeah, that's some bad timing.  Let's talk about the book.  Get a hero.  Get a hero.  Get a hero.  It's a comic book, man.  It looks cool.  I flipped open, and the first page I had landed on before, there was a guy holding, like,  a severed arm.  It's a pretty violent, and I say that in a positive way, graphic novel, I guess.  I called it a comic book, but no.  And there's a severed head a little later on in the book as well. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, yeah, bloody.  I mean, the first thing, when Joel Rose, my co-author, and I got together a few years ago,  we started talking about it.  We're both former comic collectors and, you know, comic nerds.  I used to collect as a kid.  Joel used to edit graphic novels a few years back.  So we started talking about, wouldn't it be cool?  And then what, if we could do anything we wanted in a graphic novel, what would we do?  And I thought, well, it's got to be super food nerdly. 
[02:07:30]  I mean, food's got to be really correct, even for the most nerdliest of food nerds.  No one is going to say, that is not the way you make putt of foot.  But on the other hand, it's got to be really cool.  You know, there's got to be a lot of violence in it.  Because, you know, when I read comic books, I liked the bloody ones.  And so I thought, if it's really, really violent, funny, and with a lot of really great food in it,  I haven't seen that in color.  That's a great picture.  We're looking at a picture of a boardroom, and there's probably like 12 people around the table. 
[02:08:00]  Every one of them is decapitated, and there's blood all over.  And in blood on the table, it says, flesh eaters, go vegan or go fuck yourselves.  Meat is murder.  It's really great.  And there's a guy lopping heads off with a knife.  This is really not something you would expect Anthony Bourdain to put out.  This is fantastic.  I mean, in a bloody comic book.  You wouldn't expect Anthony Bourdain to put this out.  It's fantastic.  I didn't mean that as a semicolon.  I meant that as a period. 
[02:08:30]  I meant that as a new sentence.  You know, it's a mix of a lot of things I love.  I love spaghetti westerns.  I've always loved those.  I love Japanese samurai films.  It was especially, you know, with good fire hose spurting when somebody gets wet.  Oh, yeah.  The blood squirts out.  So I just put a lot of my sort of obsessions all in one graphic novel.  And we were really, really lucky.  When we sat down with Vertigo initially, they gave us a choice of format, you know, full color, which is a big, expensive deal. 
[02:09:00]  But most importantly, they let us pick the artist.  And Langdon Foss, who worked with heavy metal, he spent a lot of time and a lot of work on this.  And, I mean, I get constant mail from him.  You know, should the knife be this?  Oh, wow.  I've been researching, you know, 15th century Japanese blades, you know, for these two panels.  Would you prefer this or this?  Is this correct?  That sort of thing.  He really worked hard on this. 
[02:09:30]  How long does it take to illustrate one of these?  Because it's just...  Almost two years, I think.  Wow.  Holy shit.  How many pages is this?  It seems like a pretty...  A hundred and something.  That's nice, man.  It's like a real place.  Basically five, what would be five separate individual, you know, paper-bound, all-bound ones.  And they're beautiful illustrations.  It just would take forever.  What was the best comic?  I collected two at one point, and then I sold them all to drink when I was a teenager.  What was your best comic book when you were collecting?  Well, I liked...  I collected early 60s Spider-Mans, the really old ones, Doctor Strange, the original Conan's. 
[02:10:00]  I liked EC, I collected old ECs.  But for me, where my head really exploded was when the first Undergrounds came out.  Early R. Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Spain Rodriguez, these guys.  I wanted to be a comic artist really badly and do, you know...  I mean, you know, this was both the most violent and pornographic stuff a 12-year-old could get his hands on at the time.  And it was also, you know, beautiful. 
[02:10:30]  I mean, these were works of art.  Are they worth a lot, those?  And counter-cultural.  I don't know.  Not as much as they could and should be.  I mean, the Golden Age stuff is still much more expensive and often less good.  I was a huge fan of Will Eisner's The Spirit, also, which had a very cinematic storytelling style, like early film noir.  So, yeah, I was really serious about the stuff.  And then, of course, I sold my collection for crack.  Everyone sells their shit for alcohol. 
[02:11:00]  I really did.  I sold a lot of...  That was a...  That was the punchline to the great comic collection story.  Yeah, you know, my grandmother burned them all or, you know, sold for crack or something.  They just found a collection somewhere.  It was, like, in somebody's closet in the back, like, years after their grandfather had died and they had, like, Action Comics No. 1, you know, which was the first Superman, the first Batman.  I mean, he had, like, a $3.5 million collection.  I never cared about those because the artwork wasn't very good.  I cared about the...  You know, if there were four issues, you know, in 1965 where one particular artist worked on them, that was the one I wanted to, you know, hold and sniff. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, do you like to smell the new thing?  It is the best smell, right?  Yeah, totally.  I won't smell this too deep because I don't want to put nose grease on the inside.  There's nothing worse than when you put nose grease on a fucking page.  But when you do something like this, do you write the story out first?  Because you're kind of...  You're going in panels.  And what is the story process with this?  You write it like a screenplay, essentially.  Oh, right, okay.  And then the artist breaks it down into a panel layout and as he runs into problems, gets back to you and says, here's the suggestion, you know, as he roughs out the visual storytelling, you know, he'll say something. 
[02:12:00]  You know, I can't fit this much text in one page or it doesn't make any sense or can you, you know, help me out here.  Okay.  So it's very back and forth.  It looks great, man.  Yeah.  I think this is going to do well for you.  It's a cool idea, definitely.  Yeah, I'm going to Comic-Con in, I think it's July, San Diego Comic-Con, which is going to be, you know, that second or third childhood for me. 
[02:12:30]  I'm really looking forward to it.  I'll be there.  Have you been before?  Never been.  It's cool.  Actually, I went back when I was, you know, a tween when they used to have it at like the Pennsylvania Hotel, I think, across from Penn Station.  A little smaller back then.  It was, you know, eight guys in a, you know, cardboard box, pretty much.  Yeah.  You know, I went with my, I went with some drawings.  I was trying to, you know, get some tips from the, from the pros.  It's pretty much keep your day job, kid.  Oh, really? 
[02:13:00]  Were hands the hardest for you?  I could never draw.  I would draw a little as a kid, but I could never draw hands.  So everybody had their hands behind their back.  We're mightily raised outside of frame.  Yeah.  I had a lot of challenges.  Mightily raised.  I can see that.  Yeah.  It's just out of frame.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Well, it looks great.  I've actually never read a, um, a graphic novel, but this one I want to read, because  it's, it's like, there's some really cool, uh, fucking graphic, graphic stuff in there.  Yeah.  I used to be into, uh, that, like, uh, old Fangora stuff. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Back, like, my, my uncle had this, uh, pile of, and it had just a mildewy smell to them,  and they were all black and white of old, uh, fifties movies and, um, uh, horror of the  day.  Yeah.  And it was pretty cool, because there were some really scantily clad, uh, women in it,  and, you know, a creature from the Black Lagoon is carting her away and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was great.  That was your first sort of exposure when you were eight, nine, ten, and you're just starting  to think about sex, and your first exposure is these sort of fifties, you know, uh, completely 
[02:14:00]  over-the-top, you know, hyper-sexualized alien.  Yeah.  I was like, you know, actual sex, you know, turns out to be a disappointment, you know?  It doesn't involve someone from the fifties being carried away by an alien.  When is this going to be available?  Uh, early July.  I think July 3rd.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Get Jiro.  Got to pick it up.  And you're also promoting, by the way, we have to say what Anthony's promoting, uh, it's 
[02:14:30]  an evening with Anthony Bourdain.  It's this Saturday, June 9th.  It's 7.30.  It's, uh, here in New York.  It's, uh, BAM, in capital letters, Howard Gilman Opera House.  It's in Brooklyn.  You can go to Ticketmaster to get tickets.  Um, this comes out, like you said, in July, and at No Reservations on Twitter.  This is called Get Jiro.  But this Saturday, 7.30 p.m., uh, at the Howard Gilman Opera House in Brooklyn, you can actually  go and watch Anthony.  What are you actually doing on your, uh, an evening with Anthony Bourdain? 
[02:15:00]  Uh, it's basically, uh, stand-up.  It's very much like stand-up.  Oh, really?  That, uh, we have to talk to the audience.  I have a bit of an audiovisual prompt to, uh, uh, you know, refer to a few seconds here  of tape or, or, or shots demonstrating various principles of eating your way around the world.  But basically, it's stand-up and then, uh, an extended Q&A with the audience.  Oh, that's cool.  Absolutely.  But, uh, in this case, uh, this is going to be a very special one because, um, I'm taking a prosecutorial  attitude, uh, shall we say. 
[02:15:30]  I'm, I'm making the case for something.  So it's a, a little unusual.  Cool, man.  That's a nice tease.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It'd be funny if it was for something really awful.  Genocide and gentrification.  Be more yuppies.  CNN's going, oh my god, what did we do?  We were just a psychopath.  It would make us happy, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  We're creeps.  Uh, I guess that's it.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Unless you want to talk about the Miami incident where the...  You know what?  You just told me.  I was going to ask.  There's a curiosity there because we're trying to figure out what part of the face would be...  Good to eat.  Well, what do you start?  How do you start a face?  Yeah, you know the story, obviously.  I would, I would, I mean, if you're looking for advice...  If you had to eat a face.  Yeah, we were saying cheeks.  That's what we said.  I said lip.  The cheeks.  No, lip is where the breath is.  Cheek.  But, but unlike this guy who apparently couldn't wait, you know, I would recommend a slow brazing  process.  You know?  Because it's pretty tough.  Yeah, it's got to be, right? 
[02:16:30]  I was like, wow, what's going on?  And the other guy who's like scooping brains or something?  For 18 minutes.  18 minutes he was eating his face.  And he wasn't just ripping the flesh off.  He was swallowing it.  That was the part of the story that really got me.  And what was his, what's the latest thing on his problem?  They said bad salts, but now they're saying bad LSD, right?  Or new LSD.  You know, I'm thinking a lot of acid earlier in my life.  At no point did I ever say, you know, I kind of want to eat that guy's face.  It's definitely not going to make my trip better if I eat this dude's face.  No.  That'll freak you out.  In fact, food and chewing in general were never sort of on my to-do list while drinking. 
[02:17:00]  No, no.  Did you like acid?  I loved it.  I was too scared to ever do it.  I mean, it's something that I did early and after a while.  You know, it was a good, it was a learning experience.  But, you know, on the other hand, a few of my friends did not have such happy experiences  and, you know, really never came back.  Wow.  It was a great adventure for me early on, but it's not a recreational drug, and it's  certainly not one that I would recommend in a blanket way to people. 
[02:17:30]  Because a lot of people just absolutely should, under no circumstances, take it.  I guess this guy in Florida would be one of those.  Yeah, yeah.  Allegedly.  It really is something, I think you really need to not have much anxiety in your life.  You need to kind of be a mellow guy, somebody that won't freak out.  You do LSD?  No.  I was too fucking scared.  No, no.  I did like mescaline years ago.  I did shrooms.  Which was kind of, you know, LSD light.  Mescaline for me too, never LSD.  Shrooms. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Never LSD though.  Shrooms and a cheese sandwich.  At a jazz festival.  I know.  That was always the biggest myth too.  They would say, oh, it tastes like shit.  You got to eat them with something.  That's what, that's exactly what happened.  It was, it's worse.  If you put mushrooms in anything else, it's making the mushrooms worse.  It's a dumb cheese sandwich.  That tastes like a shit cheese sandwich.  Here, take this Three Musketeers bar.  I heard real well though that day.  I heard everything.  Oh, did you?  Oh my God, that was great.  I heard raindrops. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  It was awesome.  But acid, too scared.  No.  I mean, I remember one time I was, you know, we were on a, me and two friends were on a,  you know, a trip and we had to stop off and get dry clothes or something at the friend's  house and it was sort of an overbearing, you know, right out of the movies, Italian  American family and the mother catches us.  You've got to stay for dinner.  Oh no.  She sits us down at the table and it's a big steak dinner.  And I, the level of denial that some families are capable of is quite extraordinary because 
[02:19:00]  we're sitting there with our eyes rolling around in our head, all staring at our food  like it's, you know, I see my steak is breathing, like up and down, up and down.  And I'm looking at it with this look of mute horror on my face and like nobody notices.  You know, the three, what's the, the three kids are acting a lot.  Oh, they're nice boys.  A little strangely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Wow is right.  That's great.  With that, we should let Anthony go. 
[02:19:30]  It was a busy day, man.  I'm glad you came back.  We like Anthony Bourdain.  Thank you guys.  Well, and thanks for, I got a, I scored a copy of this off you.  I hadn't seen it.  You haven't seen it yet.  Great.  Ticketmaster.  Oh, sorry.  No, go, go.  Ticketmaster for, for this Saturday, June 9th at the Howard Gilman Opera House in Brooklyn  if you want to see Anthony live.  Right.  And the book.  And the book is Get Giro and also CNN next year.  Next year.  So you're going to take a few months off, obviously.  Well, you're taping, but we won't see any live shows until next year. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you guys.  I'm sure you'll come back for that.  Oh, I'd love to.  Great.  Anthony Bourdain, everyone.  Thank you.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.

How are you?  Jim.  Hey, Jim.  How are you?  Anthony, hi.  Thank you.  Pleasure to meet you.  That's Anthony.  And that's Opal over there.  I saw the documentary last night.  Did you see it? 
[02:23:30]  Fantastic.  What did we think?  I thought it was great.  Paul, pleasure to meet you, sir.  Lovely to meet you, my friend.  All right.  Good, good.  Well, you know, it's a pull up a chair.  Yeah.  All in the store.  Yeah.  I just think it's, yeah, it's about you, obviously.  And what's the name of the, it's called Still Alive.  Still Alive.  Still Alive.  And I am LP.  Living proof.  Living proof.  It's such a great, different type of documentary because somebody could have just done a documentary  on you and, you know, grabbed a bunch of clips and run through that. 
[02:24:00]  Where are they now?  There he is.  Yeah, right.  Living in a trailer behind a junkyard, you know, doing a sock puppet show at the Red Lion.  And that's not what he found.  It was really a great, showing the relationship that built between you guys and kind of a building  of trust.  A buddy movie, you know, from stalker to family.  It really kind of is because he does come off a little stalkerish.  Yeah, it was frightening.  Especially at the beginning.  But I almost could relate to what he was saying because I guess I remember being 12, 13 years 
[02:24:30]  old, watching you on television like that.  You know, the family gathered around the television because you really didn't have DVRs or anything.  You watched what was on at that time.  Exactly.  And you were apparently on everything.  If you had a couch and put a camera in front of it, I magically appeared.  Yes, you were there.  I became better at showing off than showing up.  You got amazing clips from this, too.  Like, the archive footage, you seem to have access to everything. 
[02:25:00]  I didn't realize you had done fucking 50 Tonight Shows.  Yeah, I did 48, I remember six.  That's amazing.  You remember six?  Oh, man.  Were you ever under the influence when you went on?  Always under the influence.  I mean, I thought everybody had a glass of vodka in the morning in the shower, you know.  Wow.  Ed McMahon introduced me to his new wife right before he died.  And he said, you know, Paul had a problem with alcohol.  And it was one of those great moments.  I just got my fifth star as an alcoholic.  They have Ed McMahon say this guy had a problem.  Hi, Ed McMahon.  Are you kidding?  Who was world-renowned for drinking. 
[02:25:30]  Exactly.  One of the great drunks ever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did you do in Planet of the Apes?  I didn't realize you were in that until I saw the clip of you on Carson in your Planet  of the Apes outfit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I played a wise orangutan.  The thing I remember the most from being on the set is the fact that I'm standing with  40 orangutans.  And John Huston walked by.  We're getting ready to shoot something.  And as you walk by the 40 orangutans, you walk by me.  He went, hi, Paul.  And I went, wow.  Wait a minute.  It still looked like me and an orangutan. 
[02:26:00]  You were a very interesting guy on TV, though.  It's like, you know, I mean, I was born in 68, so you were a part of my childhood and  growing up.  And it was just, you know, poor Smokey and the Bandit.  My favorite line in the movie, probably, because he's thirsty, dummy.  What a great line.  He had to kick his ass just once.  In the South, they think of, Billy Bob Thornton said, in the South, they consider Smokey  and the Bandit a documentary.  So when we see those old Carson clips and various variety shows that you're on, you 
[02:26:30]  were always on, like you were always over the top on.  Was that your personality then?  Or how much did that have to do with the substances you were on?  Well, you know, I survived a 30-year chemistry experiment.  So, you know, that was, you know, the fact is that alcoholism and addiction is a progressive  disease.  So at some point, one point, I was just loving being there.  You know, I went from being the run of the litter of this weird little guy who, you  know, could run under coffee tables when he was in the fifth grade to getting all this 
[02:27:00]  attention.  So that's fantastic.  You're special.  You're loving that.  So there's a lot of energy to that.  And defensively, I'm pretty funny sometimes to keep from getting whacked.  You make them laugh, whatever.  But at a certain point, you know, the amount of alcohol and cocaine kind of kicked in.  And that whole, you know, I mean, there's a scene in the movie where I'm on Merv Griffin.  I'm just the most arrogant, grandiose, you know, little ass you've ever seen in your  life, you know.  And I look at that and I just, I can't believe that I could have turned into that and not 
[02:27:30]  known it.  That's what's frightening to me is to not know it.  So when I got sober, you know, there's nothing more pathetic than some little old guy going,  please, sir, may I have another cup of fame?  Oh, come on.  Come on, Opie.  Come on, Opie.  Come on, Anthony.  Put me on your show one more time.  It's just pathetic.  And it's not how I wanted it.  So when Kessler showed up with a camera, I was kind of, I don't think so.  I think this is to go poke the bear right now.  I have a wonderful life.  I'm now 22 years sober.  Wow.  And I love my life.  And I'm, you know, my gig at ASCAP is a full, you know, full-time job. 
[02:28:00]  Can you tell people what that is, too, if people don't know?  ASCAP is the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers.  We have almost 450,000 members.  We license the music, 100 years' worth of music, from Gershwin and Cole Porter, from Irving Berlin to Beyonce, to giants like Justin Bieber.  We are there.  And you're the president, right?  And I'm the president and chairman of the board.  Wow.  Your job to make sure people get their cash.  You know, so basically our whole gig is just, you know, radio, you play the music. 
[02:28:30]  You know, for years, music was played on the radio, and it was free to the listener, and the advertising was sold around it.  The ASCAP got a little taste of it for our writers.  The big thing is to try to make sure the guys that are making it, the music creators today, can continue to make a viable living.  As Bill Withers said, you know, he was sitting with a congressman.  He said, congressman, we've got to be able to make a living with our music.  Otherwise, we're going to have to get regular jobs.  And congressman, you do not want Ozzy Osbourne as your plumber, you know.  So that's the gig, is to make sure that everybody can enjoy the music forever. 
[02:29:00]  I mean, there's more music being played more often on more amazing devices than ever.  I love my iPhone.  I've always got my face stuck in my hand, you know.  My wife is screaming, that's Ireland out there.  Look out there.  Oh, I just found out who played Lincoln.  I want to know how many hits you wrote.  Do you know offhand?  Not nearly as many as I thought I did, you know.  There's a lot, though, Paul.  You know, I had a really nice run in the 70s, you know.  Yeah, you did.  But the big records to me weren't always the hits. 
[02:29:30]  I mean, like, I had an Elvis album cut.  I got more mileage out, you know.  I mean, I would ran back to my high school and go, please, now will you sleep with me?  Look at this, me and Elvis, you know.  So the album cuts of Ray Charles and Elvis and Sinatra and stuff like that were actually...  What's an album cut, Paul?  What's that mean?  If I knew the way, I'd go back home.  The countryside has changed so much.  A song from Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, the title song I wrote.  But yeah, I had three hits with Three Dog and Light.  I had Out in the Country, Old Fashioned, Love a Song and Family Man, You and Me Against  the World with Insulin Pulling Teeth to get me to do this. 
[02:30:00]  We've only just begun with a car.  Oh, you know, the Muppets were my...  Yeah, that's a big one.  I've got felt in my DNA.  So the work that I did with the Muppets was the best.  Rainbow Connection.  Rainbow Connection is that little song that just keeps on going.  Oh, yeah.  Wrote the songs for Stars Born, including Evergreen with Ms. Streisand.  And, you know, it was a really good life.  Then I got sober and I entered the poly-lama period of my life.  I got my certification as a drug and alcohol counselor.  And, you know... 
[02:30:30]  I think I actually called the show and talked about recovery at one point many, many years ago.  Oh, man.  Here...  Oh, right.  This show back in like 2000, was it?  In 1927.  It was...  1927.  You were still doing homework.  Right, right?  No, he was.  He wasn't.  I was working.  You were on Yo Gabba Gabba.  Yeah, now do you have little ones at home?  I got a two-year-old, so I'm like, that's Paul Williams.  I forgot the song, to be honest with you.  Yeah, how sweet.  But you did a song for Yo Gabba Gabba. 
[02:31:00]  That's pretty good.  I did.  Why are there so many songs about rainbows?  Oh, yeah.  Rainbow?  Yeah, sing a little more, I get paid.  Was there a point when you were a drug and alcohol counselor where it's like, you know,  you're in entertainment, you're this gigantic name, I mean, everybody knew who you are, and  then you go through this period where you're just kind of like a regular guy, and you're  doing this job where you're actually just listening to regular people talk, and...  Well, you know, yeah, you walk into the hospital room, and I worked as a volunteer for MAP.  MAP is a musician's assistance program.  Musicians are usually over-medicated and under-insured, you know, so... 
[02:31:30]  Right.  You go in and you try to help them get some treatment and all.  You walk into a, you know, and I was like, I mean, I was full of self.  I was like, I mean, I'm going to Ireland tomorrow.  Ireland is amazing because, you know, it's like the headwaters of alcoholism.  There's all these alcoholics to work with, you know, it's like, I'm running in and grabbing  them, and people keep grabbing me going, where'd you hide the gold, you little bastard?  All this stuff, you know.  But I'm walking to a hospital room and say, you know, hi, I'm Paul Williams, I'm an alcoholic,  and I'm your counselor, and I'm here to come touch the hem, I will save you. 
[02:32:00]  And they go, no, you're not, you're little Enos from Smoking the Bandit, and it's happening  again, you know, so...  But, you know, what happened to me is, for all the, you know, you know you're an alcoholic  when you misplace a decade.  The 80s were gone.  People were like, wait a minute, you know, why'd you quit drinking?  I said, well, it led to unplanned nudity often, and, you know, and, you know, I went from  sitting on Johnny Carson's couch to 3 a.m. peeking out the Venetian blinds at the tree  police, because I knew they were out there, you know, I just, you know, fired up on cocaine. 
[02:32:30]  It got that bad, huh?  Oh, yeah, I looked like a parrot.  I mean, I was just, you know, just, you know, just, you know, but, but, but when, when your  life turns around, you know, for the first time, I mean, I just sat down with somebody  and went, you know, somebody I didn't know, absolute stranger, and said, I'm, I'm dying,  and I need help, and, and put my hand up, and somebody reached back and said, you know,  we've been there, and we'll, we'll do it with you, so.  Do you think it was the, the drugs in the 80s that kind of, I mean, obviously, in the 
[02:33:00]  70s, you had a lot of hits, you were very active in writing and stuff, do you, was it  the drugs that kind of put the brakes on?  I think there's an arc.  I think there's an arc to when you're, when you're really relevant to an audience, I  mean, you have a certain age, you know, I mean, I wrote, I mean, basically codependent  anthems, think about it, I won't last today without you, I won't last today without you, it's  not a healthy thought, you know, I know that, you know, but, you know, so, you  know, you, you kind of crank this stuff out, and it's connecting with your audience, and  it's all kind of hallmarky, you know, and I wanted to be, I mean, I wanted to be Leon 
[02:33:30]  Russell, or I wanted to be Dr. John, you know, so I, I managed to match Dr. John with the  lifestyle, but never the music, you know, but so at a certain point, you kind of, you're,  you know, you've maybe moved on from that generation that's looking for its own music,  you know, and, and so I, I think that there was that element of, of, of fading, but the  drugs and alcohol just, you know, will put, will put you, a wall between you and anything  constructive in your life, or at least they will with me, the way I did them.  You don't think you were able to, uh, work outside of that, that box of the codependency, 
[02:34:00]  the, um, the, the lonely, different guy, uh, and kind of work outside of it, though?  I think I did, I think, I mean, I, I, you know, I, you know, writing songs for something  like Phantom of the Paradise, I would write, you know, I would, I would, uh, uh, write  essentially what were almost like parodies of different styles of music.  For some reason, what really can, where I connected with an audience is the place that,  that, you know, I'm, I mean, I've, I've turned to the guy I used to make fun of, and I have 
[02:34:30]  my cat's picture on my, my, you know, on my iPhone, it's disgusting, you know, I watch  golf and play golf, and, and, you know, I've got my cat's picture on the iPhone, I have  more pictures of my cat than I do my kids, I'm disgusting, you know, so.  You're just a nice man.  I'm a, I'm a, I turn into a nice man.  Where's that cocky smirk?  Yeah, I know, and it worked so well for so long, you know, but the fact is, I got comfortable.  I mean, I got comfortable in my own skin and all, and the idea of kind of, you know, now  celebrating, you know, what we're, we're doing here with, with the movie with Paul, he was 
[02:35:00]  still alive, is, is, you look at all this stuff, and I think there's a whole kind of a TMZ,  you know, consciousness of, about celebrity that, that we kind of look at in the film,  we kind of go, you know what, do you, is that the cornage of being, of being happy?  You have a lot of guys sit down in front of you here that are at the peak of their game,  and then, and 10 years later, you guys, 20 is what are still on the air, a lot of them  are gone.  How many of them are, are like scratching to get back on the air with you?  I just, I don't think that's, I don't, if you have to be famous to be happy, you're not 
[02:35:30]  going to be happy at some point in your life.  You told some great stories, too, in the documentary, like it was, it was really, uh, interesting  to learn about you, because again, I don't even know what I've seen, and stuff about when  you were, you were a kid, I think, um, I think when your parents passed away, and you had  to split from your, was it your brother, because the, and the line you said was like, every  time I eat, I'm taking food out of his mouth, because there was no money.  Yeah, my aunt stole me, my aunt said, you know, I went out and lived with my aunt for two  weeks, and she said, well, if you go back every bite of food you take, this is very sad, 
[02:36:00]  we'll be out of, I'll buy it out of your brother's mouth, your mom can't afford you both.  So when my dad died, my dad died in a one car, alcohol related, you know, wreck, he drove  into the abutment of a bridge, my dad was a six foot two inch, you know, man who got  up, went to work every morning, worked hard, but he came home, and, and, and alcohol was  the reward for a hard day's work, and I went, I get that, and since I work a little different  hours, I'll start at 9 a.m., you know.  Yeah, wow.  But I think, I think that, yeah, I, you know, I think that my becoming an entertainer  had a lot to do with just, you know, being 13 years old and winding up at, you know, 
[02:36:30]  at, at, you know, at school looking like I was in the third grade, I looked like, looked  like a kid until you put me next to a real kid, then I looked like a kid with a hangover  in my 20s, you know.  So, you know, I think that some of that, you know, you either fight or you make people laugh,  and I think that's part of, you know, how I became, who I became.  And you lived with your aunt.  I lived with an aunt and uncle, yeah.  It was, you know, and, you know, she wouldn't even give me the respect of abusing me.  It was just, you know, it's a nice upbringing. 
[02:37:00]  I slept alone.  It was awful.  Oh, damn it.  But you took, I just wanted to finish with that.  Are you in touch with your brother now, or?  My brother, you know who my brother is?  My brother's a wonderful songwriter.  He wrote, give me the beat, boys.  Free my soul.  I'm going to get lost in your rock and roll and drift.  The hell does that happen?  Don't be great.  Don't be great, exactly.  You know what?  My brother and I are really close.  But Dobie Gray made that a hit, and then someone recently made it a hit, too.  Yeah, Uncle Cracker had a big hit with it.  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  And like you're saying to him, you know what? 
[02:37:30]  The bridge really sounds like me.  Are you sure?  We were drinking then.  Are you sure?  I wasn't even.  Get away from me, you little bastard.  So he's six years younger than me.  He's six foot two, and he just, you know, I just love him.  He lives in Taos, New Mexico, and he wrote a bunch of great songs.  He wrote When We Make Love for Alabama and some, he had, you know, a bunch of country  hits as well.  He took me down to Nashville and cut the best record that I ever made that nobody ever bought  called A Little on the Windy Side, an album that I love to this day. 
[02:38:00]  And the week, two weeks after the album came out, the label folded portrait.  They dumped me and Ringo had new albums, and we've got so much in common.  When you, by the way, there was a funny line that we were talking about.  Who was it?  Was it Paul Simon you were talking about?  You were like, I think he asked, like, do your careers run into different directions?  You're like, well, Paul Simon might have been happy if he had done some more gong shows.  Maybe he wishes he did, and I wish I wrote Bridge Over Trouble more.  You know, yeah, yeah, Paul, God bless you, man. 
[02:38:30]  What an amazing, amazing song, you know, so.  Do you look at, as a songwriter, and obviously you'd go on shows and sing the songs,  do you look at, though, watching the Carpenters or Three Dog Nights singing these songs  and making the huge hits out of them?  Did you want to be the singer also?  No, I never loved the way I sang.  I'm, you know, I'm still a little iffy about it, you know.  But it's just, yeah, I mean, if you have the opportunity to have, you know, 
[02:39:00]  like Tony Bennett just recorded a song, like an album ago called Love Dance.  And I've recorded Love Dance, and I love the lyric, and it's a song I wrote with Yvonne Lenz,  and it's a really pretty sensual song and all.  But it's different when Tony Bennett sings.  You go, my God, that's Tony Bennett's thing in my words, you know.  And that's a rush at, you know, at this, I mean, I'm 71.  I feel like a real tired 37, but I'm 71.  And so at this point in my life, you know, it's just, you know, I don't need a lot of attention. 
[02:39:30]  I don't need a lot of attention right now.  Well, that comes out across in the documentary really well.  Stephen did such a great job of showing who you are, who you were, and who you are now.  And not the fact that it's like you're there saying, oh, I wish, or you're trying to get back to where you are.  You do come off as completely content where you are now, and watching it, I think the viewer sees it and is happy for you.  Yeah.  You know, I can't believe that, you know, accepting the Academy Award is really great, but watching golf in your underwear, that's fabulous. 
[02:40:00]  You know, that's, you know, did you watch Tiger yesterday?  Did you see his shot yesterday?  Oh, my God.  That shot.  I was trying to explain it to Anthony.  And to have Jack Nicklaus say, that's the best golf shot I've ever seen in my life.  And it was, flat out.  And he's seen a couple of shots, I bet.  The other thing that was different about him yesterday is his level of comfort.  I don't think this is a one-time thing and he's going to slip back.  You think he's back now?  I think that his next time out, you'll see the same game.  He's creeping right back to where he was.  I was wrong. 
[02:40:30]  I said, I thought he was done.  Did you?  I really did.  Shame.  I said he'd win a few tournaments, but as far as, you know, making a run for that record of the majors, he's done.  What we saw yesterday is like, I mean, that was, and you know what he said, it's interesting, but what he said about this shot, he said that's not the best shot of the perfect golf shot he said he made is the one over the green to there.  Oh, wow.  That's where he wanted to go, which is, you know, but the thing is, the other thing about this attention right now is there are two things I'm really passionate about. 
[02:41:00]  Obviously, I'm passionate about recovery, that, you know, that this has been an amazing gift and anything I can do to pass it on is great.  But also because I'm president of ASCAP, I can, you know, can talk about the fact that to the kids that are listening to, you know, to the music and all is that we're not trying to shut down the Internet.  Don't, you know, that's not what we're doing.  We just want the servers, the people that are giving you the music to pay a little part of that advertising as they always have so that there's right now there's some little lady with the headphones on or an electric keyboard writing a wonderful song. 
[02:41:30]  And she's got the headphones on because she doesn't want to wake the baby in the next room.  And, damn it, she deserves to make a living with her music, you know.  So that's the gig I have now.  And that's why I kind of welcome, I love the chance to do this, guys.  I really appreciate it.  Are you guys going after radio stations to get a little more money?  No, no, no.  As a matter of fact, we're following your career closely and trying to pull back our prices wherever you're working.  That's hilarious. 
[02:42:00]  You've stayed unbelievably active into your 70s now.  Yeah.  Was there a point between when you first started recovery till now that you kind of stopped doing anything?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I was really happy to run on the beach and play golf and, you know, and a new wife.  And that offered a lot of, you know, of joy in my life.  Sure.  Kind of reestablishing my relationship with my kids and all.  And just, you know, kind of just getting comfortable. 
[02:42:30]  Just being in my own skin and not being, you know, you talked about how on I was.  That's exhausting, you know.  It looked exhausting to watch.  Oh, it's just exhausting trying to be that charming and that funny all the time.  You know, when the fact is, you know, that I was slowly, my DNA was slowly shifting to ass, you know.  It was just.  How many times have you had, Paul?  When you get sober, I mean, I don't know about the rest of the world, but when I got sober, I noticed something.  I was tired.  Really?  I was tired of, and I was so over Paul Williams. 
[02:43:00]  I mean, I was, you know, it's like I'm done talking about this guy for a long time.  You know what, watching it, though, watching the clips from the documentary of you on various talk shows early on, I remember watching those shows growing up, and it wasn't exhausting to watch.  You were a fun, active guy.  People loved watching you.  But in the context of the documentary, it's exhausting watching you.  And watching you watch yourself is exhausting.  Oh, my God.  It's just, you know.  That one clip where Stephen sits you down to watch a Merv Griffin clip of you, and you're rattling off. 
[02:43:30]  It seemed, I don't know, were you doing cocaine at the time?  Maybe just a little.  Maybe a tad, because you were rattling off.  You were going, going, going, and it seemed like you were a ship without a rudder.  Oh, yeah.  And it was, it was, no, Chip.  It was very difficult to watch you watch that.  Yeah, it was painful for me to watch that.  And, you know, when Steve started this whole process, he said, if you don't like something, I'll take it out. 
[02:44:00]  And so I'm sitting there, and he's filming me watch me at my absolute worst.  I mean, I was, and again, the most, how unlikable can you get?  How arrogant, how grandiose, how shallow can you get?  And, I mean, I'm joking about marital infidelity, talking about, I'm a devoted husband until I buy that plane ticket.  I'm going, oh, my God, what kind of an ass would say such, you know.  And so, so I said, you cannot use that.  You cannot put that.  I don't want my daughter to see that.  You know, I think about my daughter and, you know, and her mother sitting in a theater and seeing that footage. 
[02:44:30]  But I did wonder how he talked you into it.  No, he didn't talk me into it.  Oh, he didn't?  No, I talked him.  He just put it in?  You know what, he put it in in a rough cut, and I saw it, and I went, you know what, you have to use it.  If you're going to have the arc of this film be, you know, where I wind up with a life that is a real gift, in recovery, you really have to see how bad it got, how bad I got.  And your whole, the way you detest watching it, it proves something there.  It shows that you have changed as a person, and I think it works very well in the documentary. 
[02:45:00]  You know what's frightening about it, too, is that, you know, the other thing that I realized, as I was saying, leave it in there, is that this happened once, in like 1983 or whatever, and nobody remembers it, and it's gone.  But you have now converted it to zeros and ones, and fed it into the big, you know, the big internet googly-gock, you know, where it thrives and grows.  Forever.  And versions of this now will reappear in the life. 
[02:45:30]  So I have to live with this for the rest of my life now.  This went from being part of something I had to check off and that I was ashamed of, or maybe had no idea how bad it was.  Now we go, we let everybody see it.  It's almost a way to make peace with it, huh?  It is, ultimately.  You're exactly right.  It's part of the process, you know.  So the other thing, I've always said that, you know, I joke about the, you know, I think I used the line here that, you know, you know you're an alcoholic when you misplace a decade.  But that decade is lost, and it's worthless unless I use it now. 
[02:46:00]  And the way I can use it now is what we're doing right now, is talking about recovery.  You said something about being married, too.  Like, I know you've been married a few times.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I finally got it right.  I'm married to Mariana Escalante Williams.  Her brother, incidentally, is Joe Escalante, the leader of the Vandals.  I don't know if you guys are hip to the Vandals or not, who's running for judge.  Joe, we're with you.  I mean, a punk rocker running for judge.  End times.  It must be end times.  But I'm married to Mariana Escalante Williams.  She's a Swedish and Mexican.  I just did a red eye with him. 
[02:46:30]  With Joe?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It was on Fox News.  He's fabulous.  He's hysterical.  He's very funny, you know.  And, I mean, he's a bullfighter, and he wants to be a judge.  And he's a punk rocker, you know.  Yeah.  Life is good.  You said that you're...  That's cool.  The line I like, you said you're a new wife, because you're talking about being in recovery,  and you said she got the man that the other women thought they were getting.  Yeah.  And the other women deserved, you know.  Yeah.  I was busy again being charming.  How many times were you married?  The Americans, the Pillsbury Doughboy song, you know. 
[02:47:00]  How many times were you married, Paul?  This is my third time, and this is right, you know.  This is it.  And I'm good friends with the mother of my children, you know.  We get along beautifully.  Both my kids are doing well.  Did you have the rocky period where you didn't quite get along with them?  I mean, after the marriage.  There was one in the middle we're not talking about, and it's going to stay that way, you  know, because, you know, we don't want lightning in this studio.  But, you know what, it's just, it's a drama-free relationship. 
[02:47:30]  Mariana is beautiful.  She's interesting.  She's a novelist.  She's written three books now, and she's just, she used to play piano and sing, you  know, and she makes me laugh.  She's beautiful.  I want to plug this, too, because it's called Paul Williams Still Alive, and it's premiering  in Los Angeles and New York.  It's at the Angelica here in New York on June 8th.  That's this Friday.  And the New Art in Los Angeles on June 22nd.  And that's where a lot of the documentaries pop up in the Angelica. 
[02:48:00]  It's fantastic.  It really is.  I can't rave about it enough.  It's unbelievable.  It's a great subject, which is Paul, and done so well by Stephen Kessler.  It's funny, isn't it?  It's very funny.  It's very funny.  I mean, you know, you talk about golf and how much you love the game.  You obviously play a lot.  But that shot that he put in there of Michael Bolton teeing off, and it looked flawless.  Yeah.  And then you plinking one right in the water.  Oh, I put one about seven feet in front of me.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, that to me is very funny in a documentary there. 
[02:48:30]  And that was one of my best shots.  What kind of handicap are you talking about?  You know, I'm a high handicap.  I think I'm 27, you know.  But the thing is, I keep lessons, so it keeps changing.  I just got fitted for clubs.  Now everything goes further than it used to.  You know, but I'll take that any time.  Right.  Do you play?  Not as much as I like.  Take me out.  He was pretty good, actually.  This would be the perfect ending to our story.  Take me out.  That really would be.  I would love to play golf with Paul Williams.  Yeah.  I don't play as much because I've got a two-year-old, so I would like to get out there more. 
[02:49:00]  You know, if anybody had told me 15 years ago or whatever the first time we talked, that  we'd sit here and that you had seen my performance on Yo Gabba Gabba, I would have said they  need a treatment.  You just pop up all the time.  You never really went away, Paul.  Yeah.  That's what the whole thing of the documentary is, too.  And especially seeing you in the Philippines, the crowds are amazing.  Massive.  They're massive.  They're there for you.  I mean, like they said, you never went away as far as that's concerned. 
[02:49:30]  What do you attribute that to?  The Philippines?  Yeah.  You know what?  The songs that were hits in the Philippines are the most, I mean, the songs that they love  the most need to go directly onto the cover of a Hallmark card.  They are the most absolute, completely sentimental things I've ever written in my life.  And they just love that sweet.  They're the sweetest people in the world.  And, you know, I would always make that little tour.  I'd go to the Philippines.  I'd go to Japan. 
[02:50:00]  Buy my clothes in Japan.  In Japan, I'm a medium.  Australia.  You know, and some of the old ones still work.  It's just amazing.  But, you know, it's just, it's always, you know, you walk on that stage in what is basically  a Coliseum setting.  Yeah.  And it's just, you know, if you want a quick dose of gratitude, if you want to go feel like  you're a beetle for a day, that's the place to go do it for me and all.  And they're just lovely, lovely people. 
[02:50:30]  And I, you know, I, I weren't, was never really worried about Al Qaeda coming to snatches up.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  But I loved, you know, I, my, one of my favorite moments in the movie is when Steve Kessler is  sitting in my dressing room and he, and he's hungry and he's scared.  He thinks Al Qaeda is going to get him and he doesn't even care that I'm there.  Yeah.  And when he gets to that point where he didn't care that I was there, then I fell in love  with him.  Yeah.  And I was like, okay, now we can be friends.  You're talking about your Splenda and underwear and he's worried about, you know, some Al Qaeda  cell in the Philippines. 
[02:51:00]  Amazing.  That was great.  And, and you really show how appreciative you are.  You stayed and signed everything and took pictures with everybody.  Yeah.  And there were a lot of people there.  I try to always do that.  You know, it's just, it's, you know, I don't feel like, I feel, you know, in a lot of  ways I feel like I was kind of plopped out of the audience and put up on stage to, you  know, to represent them.  So I don't really feel a great separation between me and the audience, you know, people  snatch me up on the street.  It's like, come here, I want you to meet Martha, you know, I don't think they ever did that 
[02:51:30]  to Sinatra, but me, they'll grab up in the neck and go, you know what, Ernie needs to  meet you and we go meet Ernie, you know, so I, I think that the people are really comfortable  with me and I think they sense that I'm really comfortable with them, you know, at this  point, I mean, I'm just grateful.  I mean, I, my train rolls on two tracks on gratitude and trust.  I trust I'll be, you know, where I'm needed and lead me where you need me and, and, and  let the day roll on out.  And it certainly, I really appreciate the, the, the fine treatment here today.  Well, you know what? 
[02:52:00]  And I want to say something.  We rarely do this.  I, I, I want to apologize to you.  We, we hung up on you like 10 years ago because I think we were just being stupid and having  a bad day or something.  Very kind.  But we fucking missed out is what I'm learning today.  Well, how kind?  And I did too.  You know, I did too.  But you know, the fact is that you may have been right.  I mean, I may have been, I may have been peddling something that was irrelevant at the time.  I don't know.  I don't know the circumstances of what happened that day, but we used to do, you know, crazy  stuff that didn't.  We were idiots.  We were just idiots that day. 
[02:52:30]  Well, I never did anything like that.  No, but we don't have anything to blame it on.  No.  I don't remember the actual circumstances.  Yeah, but.  I'm sure it was nothing you did that day.  Well, thank you.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  And obviously we missed out.  Because you.  All I know is that the more of resistance I felt, the more I dug in.  So I probably contributed to it a little bit.  It was, it was, it was obnoxious.  It's unnecessary.  Unnecessary.  And, and watching the documentary, it's like, you've, you went from the Paul Williams  that we knew from TV to now. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely, you know, happy and, and doing very well.  Thank God.  And we just, I guess in that interim, couldn't figure out what the fuck to talk to you about.  But lovely.  Look at this now.  I mean, this is wonderful.  It's a love fest now.  It's a love fest now.  It's absolutely disgusting.  Can we end it on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a,  kiss my, if on the way out, he put gas and then lit the fucking front door on fire  and then just washed this through the glass.  I'm really sorry about the sugar in the gas tank. 
[02:53:30]  This whole thing was a setup to burn us together.  Payback time.  Oh, that was terrible.  All right, we got to, thank you guys.  Let me promote it one more time.  Paul Williams still alive.  Honestly, a fantastic documentary.  The Angelica here in Manhattan, June the 8th this Friday.  And if you're out on the West Coast in LA, the new art in Los Angeles.  And Paul, thank you, man.  Thanks so much, Paul.  You're in the will.  Thank you.  You're in the will.  The great, but not when it comes to golf.  Paul Williams.  Yeah.  Let's play. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  I'll play.  Paul Williams, everyone.  Is my microphone on?  Because it's important questions I have.  Do you suffer from erectile dysfunction?  I occasionally do.  That's Jim Norton adding his own life experience.  Could it be perhaps you're tired of banging your wife?  That's a very, very real possibility.  For myself, that's not the case because I'm not married.  I get tired of banging girlfriends.  So if you're married, you know that you're probably tired of fucking that monster. 
[02:54:30]  How many times can you fuck the same woman before your dick tells you he's had enough?  That's your dick rebelling.  It's falling asleep on your balls because it's tired of that same awful wifely vagina.  Introduce him to some new pussy for Pete's sake and bam, you're banging like you're back in the 12th grade  or 14th grade or 6th grade if you're at Castle Cumia.  So where is the best place to find new pussy?  AshleyMadison.com.  We all know it's a bunch of unhappy married women. 
[02:55:00]  You're an unhappy married man where your dick is wilting at the side of that awful fucking gaping mouth vagina.  Looks like the half-eaten face in Miami.  You're tired of it.

[02:55:30]  Even if you don't find some sex-deprived wife whose husband probably has ED.  Oh, erectile dysfunction.  I thought it was Ed.  They have a horse.  A talking horse who fucks your wife.  If AshleyMadison, they'll give you your money back.  How many money back guarantees do you get that you're going to get laid?  You just don't.  So if you don't find some sex-crazed whore, you're getting your money back.  What's better?  Popping a blue pill to bang your wife for the thousandth time or listening to your dick  because that is what an erection problem is.  Your dick is yelling out, help! 
[02:56:00]  Find someone new, hot, and horny, and then take a blue pill  because you're probably a horrible fuck to begin with.  So why would you waste your horrible fuck skills on a new girl?

[02:56:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Channel.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of a treat.  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?  On Sirius XM.  Last night I think I shit the bed  Got so drunk I gave a dude head  Life is just a merciful blur  When you pop a piss-wassa  Piss-wassa, don't drink it slow  3 a.m. 
[02:57:00]  Bats up low  Sleep in the bathroom on the floor  What really matters anymore  All the crap you do  All day  Who fucking cares  Anyway  Piss-wassa  This is beer  Drop drunk  All for beer  Piss-wassa  Drink all day  It helps your trouble  Go away  Piss-wassa  Cheap German lager for export only 
[02:57:30]  Sirius XM  This is the Opinetry Show  This is the Opinetry Show  This is the Opinetry Show 
[02:58:00]  Oh, let's get Uriah Faber in here  It's guest day on the Opinetry Show  Yes  And then I saw Penn Jillette in the freaking bathroom  And I go, Penn, we can't even fit you in today  I'm sorry  Yeah  What's up, Uriah?  What's up, guys?  Hello, sir  How are you doing, man?  How are you?  Good, how are you guys doing? 
[02:58:30]  Really good  Good  You cut that hair  I did  You know what?  A lot of people are probably talking about that  My little sister was in a car accident  She had her skull removed  Jesus  What's up?  Yeah, it was like  She had her head shaved  And so  What do you mean she had her skull removed?  To get the swelling down?  Yeah  So she was in a car accident on Black Friday  Six-car pileup  And she was in a coma for seven days  She's 19  And basically 
[02:59:00]  So yeah, sympathetic head shaving kind of a thing  Yeah  And didn't she hit a rubber necker?  That's what  The person in front of her was slowing down to look at an accident or something like that  Like probably not doing the speed  Wow  And caused the pileup  I think that's what happened  I instantly beeped at those people  The second I see brake lights  I put my hand on the horn  When an accident's up ahead  And I'm like  I see fucking brake lights  On this guy in front of me  He's getting nailed  Yeah, yeah  Bam  And then I pass him  And then you know what you do?  You put your tires on the shoulder  And it flings rocks into their windshield  And that's  Yeah  Don't fucking rubber neck 
[02:59:30]  Genius  How's she doing?  She's doing awesome now  I mean  She had her skull removed for two and a half months  What part?  Just like a whole third of it on the right side  And where do they put the skull?  Her left side  Where do they put that skull for a while?  They do one of two things  And she's a thin girl  So they put it in her freezer  But they sometimes make a pocket in the fat lining  Yeah  And put the skull inside your own body  Wow  Which is a trip  I mean they have some crazy scientific stuff  Shit 
[03:00:00]  But that's like an extra operation  Aren't you almost better having it in the freezer?  Like where it's not going to be an extra surgery  To put it in and take it out of you?  I would think so  But  What do they do to cover that too?  Because I've heard of brain swelling before  And it's like  How do they keep that from getting infected?  How do you shower?  How do you sleep?  What do they put over that?  They just sew the skin back up  And then they  So it's just soft right there  Wow  And  Yeah  How do they learn how to do all that?  It's like being a baby again  It's like literally being a baby again  With the front of your head 
[03:00:30]  And she was  She was in the hospital for a month and a half  So  They're just really cautious with everything  And then if she was going to walk around  They'd put a  They'd put a  You know  A helmet on her  And stuff like that  See this says  The favor report  What's that?  Where?  Hey  I made it guys  Is that  Oh  Financial  Financial  Financial  Financial circles now  So  So she's doing better  Did you say  It was in the book  Because I was  I was looking through the book  Where you're saying  You're not scared that often  But that was something 
[03:01:00]  You really thought  That she might  Yeah  Oh man  I was freaked out  I mean that's my baby sister  I was  I was 13  When she was born  So it's been almost like a parental role  I've had  Yeah  And  You know  I was in  I was in  I landed in New York  I was there for about an hour and a half  And I got the call from my mom  Who was just hysterically  Just  Crying  And like  I couldn't understand what she was saying  And then she kind of like got out  The brain surgery  And  Your sister  And  So  Yeah 
[03:01:30]  It was pretty crazy  I flew right back  And was in the hospital for about two weeks  You know  18 hours a day  It was crazy  Yeah  You a protective older brother?  I wouldn't say I'm real protective  Like  Like  I'm not like a weirdo protective  You know  My sister's got a  Tony Montana  Yeah  That's a little weird  We're married Saturday  Yeah  All the women in my family are like  Tough  Like wear the pants chicks  Like I don't have to worry about it  My mom's like  Like she's a  You know  Like an Italian woman 
[03:02:00]  And my little sister  She's always  You know  She had a boyfriend for three years  And like  Like  Snapped her fingers  And he'd be following  And stuff like  You know  Yeah  I'm not like a super weirdo  Like some guys are  I've seen some weird dudes  When it comes to their sisters  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  A weird  Like  Not just looking out for bad things  But right  The creepy  We all know what we mean by weird  That is true  I probably didn't use  With a graphic  Graphic explanation  That I'd love to do  Of course we would 
[03:02:30]  I'm not one of those guys  But I just love  Describing it  For some reason  Well  What a creep  One of my favorite  Stories is what you had  Your sister's friends do  Well that was my sister's friend  You used your sister  To get some other things done  I was probably  I was probably  Eleven years old  Maybe my sister was  Seven or eight  And she would have  Her friends come over  For sleepovers  And they'd put their  Nightgowns on  And then I would say  Hey  Why don't we all  Why don't all you girls 
[03:03:00]  Have a headstand contest  Against the wall  And they would do that  And all their nightgowns  Would just fall over their heads  And I'd be like  Oh stay as long as you can  You wouldn't look at your sister  Oh don't  No no no  She was just collateral damage  For what I wanted to say  You made sure she was  Way on the left  Yes  So you didn't have to look  That's a really cool trick  The young Kelly girl  Down the street  Was the one I was  Looking for  That's cute when you're  Like eleven and they're eight  Like that's acceptable  Yeah it's all the same age group  But you know  It gets to a certain point  Where there's something  Very creepy about it  Like if you're thirty  And she's seven 
[03:03:30]  It's probably a fucking  Horrible contest to run  What kind of women  Do you  What kind of women do you like  Do you like dominant  Or more submissive women  Because it's weird  Like when people have  Dominant women in the family  Or dominant males in the family  A lot of times  They go for the same thing  In real life  Or do you  Or a dominant job  Like Uriah has too  Oh yeah  That sometimes makes you  Want something a little different  Something different  It just kind of depends  I like a chick  That has her own interests  For sure  I mean I can't handle  Somebody that's just  All into my business  All the time  You got to have her own interests 
[03:04:00]  You know do that kind of thing  But I like  You know  Somebody that  That is pretty assertive  You have to be  I don't really have time  To focus on  On like  Holding down a chick  At this point  So it's  You got to have her own stuff  Going on  And not be worrying about me  All the time  And stuff like that  Is it fun to be shirtless  In front of a girl  I'm kind of  I'm 43  I think the last time  I did that  I'm trying to think  Of who was in office  I want to say  Reagan  First term  Is the last time  I come to a girl 
[03:04:30]  And he looked better shirtless  He really did  Oh it's humiliating  Whenever you get into  A hot tub with a chick  I have to go  What the fuck is that over there  And then they look  And I sink  It's humiliating  Do you go in with the shirt though  No no no  You're able to take it off  As she's looking somewhere else  I can suck it in  But I pull them off  Like fucking Fred Mert  But when you're sinking  Into the hot tub  There's that one moment  Where the tits  And the side fat  Are going to meet  When you're squatting  Last night was bad  Because the water  Was so hot 
[03:05:00]  He couldn't get down  Into it quickly enough  My fucking scrotum  I just  I threw my scrotum  Under the bus  Right into the scalding water  Right into scalding  Just so she doesn't see you  Without a shirt on  I fucking dropped in  Like Ted Kennedy  Was driving me  But you're working out now  Jimmy  You know  You're working out  Just like Uriah does  The copy I have  Of Uriah's book  That I was looking through  It's called  By the way  That's what we're promoting  Yes  It's called  Laws of the Ring  And it's on sale now  And the copy I have  Is an advanced copy  With no photos  So I'm looking through photos 
[03:05:30]  I got photos  In this copy  Today's copy  Oh I see what you're saying  And just like  It's like  All those pictures  In the ring  And I'm like  God that must just be  A great way  Even if you're not a fighter  To feel good enough  About yourself  Like is the beach nice  Jimmy doesn't go  Hey what you gotta do  Is you gotta make  What you're rocking  The cool thing  And start just wearing it dude  But we're trying to figure out  What that is  So far what I'm rocking  Is I've met Uriah Faber  And other UFC guys  But that's never gonna get me laid  No  Guess who I've talked to  Yeah it's 
[03:06:00]  Funny is good to a certain degree  But they'll always  It's awesome  I hear the street fights  In the book  Oh yeah  Yeah cause you've talked about it  On our show  And it's an amazing story  But the details  Cause there's a lot more details  In the book  Than you've told us  Over the years  Yeah no  It's a long story  Yeah I mean  We would be here all day  I was fighting for my life  And all that good stuff  But yeah  People were enjoying  The little details  What was going through my mind  And stuff like that  But yeah  For those who don't know  I was in a fight in Indonesia  Really dumb of me 
[03:06:30]  And I learned from it  But basically had one guy  Then three guys after me  Then twelve guys after me  Then four  And then got Rodney King'd  In the taxi  And barely got out of there  The weird part too  Is you talk interesting  Cause there's a part  Where he's in the alley  About to fight this dude  And his friends  The guy's yelling and posturing  Which was to get his friends out  Yeah  And you said one on one  One on one  And then they start chanting  After like one  One 
[03:07:00]  By one  One by one  One by one  Yeah that little language barrier  He really  They thought he was challenging  The whole fucking town  Like a Bruce Lee movie  I'll take you all on  Fuck that  Oh shit  Oh yeah no  It was a scary thing man  I got  Is there footage of that  This  No  Street fight  There's no  I don't know  Nowadays everything's filmed  How many years ago was that  That was 2005  I think  2006  Right around the time  Before everyone started  Filming everything  Yeah  And I didn't have any money  Back then either  So I would have had  Just the what 
[03:07:30]  Pedro at that point  Well yeah  Cell phone  Now there'd be cell phone footage  Somebody in Indonesia  Well that's what I'm asking  Would have grabbed that  Yeah  What is it too  There's an interesting story  About your first fight  In the opening of the book  Where you're talking about  There's a  You're fighting this Mexican dude  Or this guy with tattoos  Like he looks like a fighter  And you're this clean cut  You know  Looking like a college kid  And everybody's thinking  You're about to get  The shit beat out of you  That you were in the wrong  What is it that  Enables you to go  You're saying  You're saying to yourself  You're dead dude  Like that's what you're thinking 
[03:08:00]  You're not afraid of this guy  Well it's just something that  I mean I've always thought  That no one could beat me up  I mean you kind of have to  Have that mentality  To be in my sport  And especially  You know  Get to the top of the sport  But I do remember  You know  Taking the first fight  And I remember  If I'm going to get nervous  This whole process  I'm not going to do it again  I don't want to be  I mean  Anybody that's had a fight  As a little kid  Like the anticipation  Of the fight  Is the bad thing  So I was like  Okay I find out  A month before  I'm fighting this dude  And I was like  If I'm going to be  Stressing about it 
[03:08:30]  I'm not going to  I'm not going to do it again  But it wasn't stressful  Until I got to that  The arena  And I was like  Alright  I've always thought  I'm a bad dude  And there's no reason  To stress  But walking into that cage  I remember thinking  Like what the hell  Am I doing  Yeah I got this  Big old Mexican dude  He's jumping around  He's got pride tattooed  On his stomach  And he's bald  And I'm like  What am I  I don't understand  What I'm doing this for  But then once I got in the cage  It was like  Alright now it's  It's go time  And I'm not about to 
[03:09:00]  Let anybody do anything to me  So do you read people  Like people's bullshit  Because I'm the one  Who would fall for that  Like if a guy is  Posturing  If a guy is like  You're dead  I'd be like  Oh he's right  I am  I'm dead  But you seem to see that  As false bravado  And like he's trying  To oversell something  Yeah you know  I think  There's no reason  When you're in a  Combat situation  And you're about to  Really throw down  With someone  There's no reason  To talk to them  There's no reason  To look mean  There's no reason  To do anything 
[03:09:30]  Because you're going  To find out  Who's the bad  Dude right there  You know  It's going to be  A quick reckoning  Of  Alright  Am I going to get  My ass kicked  Or am I going to  Kick someone's ass  So you know  The posturing  It doesn't make  Much sense  So the stare down  Doesn't mean anything  To you really  Will you stare  Or do you not  Care about that  It's usually  In the moment  So if I'm in a  Stare down situation  I'm already in the zone  And I'm just looking  Whatever I look like  I don't even know  What I'm thinking  It's just  Like I'm looking  At this guy  And it's not 
[03:10:00]  Because I'm trying  To intimidate him  This is really  The way I'm looking  At him  You know  So you're not  Worried about  Like I'm going  To try to psych him  I guess you're beyond  You're way beyond  That point  It's like  The psyching  Psyching guy out  Especially at this level  Is not the concern  It's beating him up  Is the most important thing  You're fighting  Your next fight  I'm actually going  To be at that fight  Which is July  I want to say  July 7th  In Vegas  It's UFC 148  And of course  The headline fight  Are you the co-main event?  Co-main event 
[03:10:30]  And the main event  Is of course  Anderson Silva  Chael Sonnen  That's going to be  A great fight  It's going to be awesome  Wow  I'm really looking  Forward to that fight  But Chael is one  Of those guys  Like Chael  Is a talker  Chael taunts  But he almost seems  To a point where  He's got to be  In Silva's head  On some level  There's no way  For sure  For sure  You see  The last time  When he beat  Who did he beat  From the UK  Was it  Oh god  Fuck  He was on 
[03:11:00]  The Ultimate Fighter  Yeah  He was the coach  For Ultimate Fighter  Anyways  He beats him  And as soon as he  As soon as he wins  Bisping  Michael Bisping  As soon as  As soon as he  Beats Bisping  They hand him the mic  And it shows  Anderson Silva  And he like  Is in his chair  And he's like  Looking away  And looking down  And just like  Oh my god  Like just  Bugging him  That Chael's  Gonna get on the mic  And he just  Gets on the mic  And says  Anderson Silva  You absolutely 
[03:11:30]  Suck  And Silva's  Just like  What's he gonna do  You know what I mean  He's already tried  To not fight the guy  And then he's  Gotta listen to him  Talk crap to him  It's like  It's a crazy thing  And Chael's  The best at it  Chael is  But he's an animal  Like he's a nightmare  In the ring  He just does nothing  But stay on you  It's like a fucking  Horror show  It's like  Having the flu  He just fucking  Hits you  And he's all over you  It's like  Can that get to a point  Where you hear a guy  Talking shit  And you're like 
[03:12:00]  Oh fuck him  He's scared  He's trying to  And then it gets to a point  Where it just begins  To eat at you  And it does begin  To scare you  Because Silva  Everyone talks about  Like he's  Christ  I mean nobody says  Bad things about  Anderson Silva  Right  Yeah I think  That and the fact  That the first time  They fought  I mean  Chael was beating  The crap out of him  You know  So I mean  That's got to be  Sticking his mind also  Not only is there  A lot to risk  Because this guy's  Been running his mouth  And calling him  A dirt bag  And everything  Insulting his country  So he's got to go out there  And put all the pressure 
[03:12:30]  On Anderson  And he already  Went up against him  And if you guys  Saw the first fight  Chael just mopped him up  And then got caught  At the very end  So Anderson's  Not only risking  Getting beat up  But he's got to  Defend his country  He's got to  Punish this guy  For talking crap to him  Chael's doing a good job  Of getting in his head  Do you think  It's also a part of it  Because I mean  They say Chael  Was on some substance  That he got banned  For a year after  Is it possible  That Silva's like  Well he won't be on that  This time  So now I'll have a  Or do you think 
[03:13:00]  That doesn't matter  You know I think  I think Anderson's  Going to come in  With his A game  He's going to come in  Basically  Trying  You know  To be on his  On his best  I think the last time  He kind of  Underested  Underestimated Chael  But I think  Chael got okayed  To do the TR  The testosterone therapy  Stuff so  So I think  What's that mean  I don't know what that means  The testosterone therapy  Is that  That's what  That's what he got  In trouble for  Was he was over  The legal limit  For doing this  Testosterone therapy  Oh  And he got a  He got it okayed 
[03:13:30]  By the commission  To have the testosterone therapy  But he just can't be  Over a certain amount  So I think he'll still  Be on something  Oh is that what it was  It wasn't like  He was doing  Illegal steroids  He was doing  He had an  Okay about the steroids  Or whatever he's using  The therapy  And  His  He went too high  On the legal limit  Oh I didn't know that  Okay  Testosterone therapy  What does that help with  Because I have a feeling  That really was  That would be a great  In a new segment  You know  That would be great though  If I was hosting 
[03:14:00]  My own TV show  And Uriah was on  And that was all we did  I just said  What is that  And you said testosterone  I will be right back  With our next guest  But what does it help with  Because I drink  I was drinking  Soy lattes for a while  And somebody said  That that kind of  Gives you tits  And estrogen  And I'm just  I want some more  Testosterone I guess  Helps with everything  Right  I guess so  I mean  Yeah  It's basically  Once you reach  A certain age  It just starts  Depleting after that  And it helps you  Get back to  You know  Your youthful  Top level 
[03:14:30]  I don't know  Too much about it  I haven't like  Done any real research  On the thing yet  But  It seems to be  An unfair advantage  Yeah  Yeah  That might help you  With the beach  You know what  It really might  But no  It would probably  Just give me a rage  That I couldn't back up  Like it would probably  Just make me as out of shape  I'd be like  What the fuck  Are you looking at  And I'd go you  And I'd knock my  Fucking teeth out  Which would help  My physique  If I could stop eating  But that's a case  Where I think  That the ultimate  Shit talking  Is beginning to 
[03:15:00]  I don't know  How Silva is  We had him in once  But he's  He's intense  He's very soft spoken  Yeah  He doesn't speak  In a weird way  Yeah  Yeah but he's  Very soft spoken  He almost whispers  Yeah yeah yeah  Did he  Is he able to talk  With you guys  Oh yeah we interviewed him  Yeah we did alright  With him  He was to promote  Like water  His documentary  When that came out  Okay  I mean he was  Easier than Fedor  That was the hardest one  Fedor  Not a word of English  With the Russian translator  Yeah that was a little rough  With his guys with him  It was very intimidating  That day  Yeah I'll bet 
[03:15:30]  He's got a lot of guys  We don't know what they're about  Five accountants  And we don't want to know  Yeah five legitimate  Russian accountants  Sitting behind him  Not at all  Not at all uncomfortable  Russian accountants  For sure  Yeah  Very legitimate  Five spiritual advisors  Behind him  Large men  Didn't they have Russian  Olympic jackets on  Of course they did  Yeah they were very comfortable  Walking around with Russian Olympic  They looked like  They were just tough  Fucking dudes man  Yeah  But he was the nicest one  Of the  Like he was the  Softest spoken  Of the group  Nice guy  But I'm wondering 
[03:16:00]  If this is going to affect  Silver  I'm flying out  For this  And I didn't realize  At first  That you were on the  How come all over the place  Why is there an interim title now  How come nobody has the belt  Well Dominic Cruz  Has the belt  He's been out  He had hand surgery  After his last fight  And now he blew out his ACL  So he's going to be out  Basically won't be fighting  For about a year and a half  And you know  The reason they do that  I think is  Because until a guy's recovered  He's not recovered  You know  And it just kind of 
[03:16:30]  Is like a place folder  And so we have someone  Who's the best in the world  Who's able to fight right now  And that's what  Hanan Baral and I  Are fighting for  It's going to be a great fight  The guy I'm fighting  Hanan is  On a 27 fight win streak  Jeez  And he's dangerous  More dangerous than Dominic  He's not as tricky  Not as elusive  And stuff like that  So it'll be  Like a more straightforward fight  But he's been knocking guys out  And submitting guys  I mean he's a dangerous dude  Now Dominic  Do you guys really not like each other  How much of that was for the show 
[03:17:00]  Or how much of it was just genuine  Like we just don't like each other  We've had a long pass  Of not getting along  And I mean  It's not like a hatred thing  We've had to deal with each other  On a bunch of different occasions  But  I've always felt like  He's just got like a chip on his shoulder  When it comes to me  Right  You know I was like  The face of  Of the WC  And he was in the WC  And you know  I get pushed as like  The lighter weight go to guy  But he's the champion  So  I think he's just a little bitter  And 
[03:17:30]  He's a poor loser  And I beat him  And  So there's just like  A lot of  You know  Like  Bad blood between us  But it's not like  We're trying to fight each other  Every time we see each other  It's just more like  I'll make fun of him  Every time I see him  Okay  So you might be in his head  A little bit  Probably a little bit  Would you fight  I'm sure you would  But  Would you fight Aldo again  That was a  Brutal video  Ugh  Wow  I would fight Aldo again  But  That's a great answer  That was very honest 
[03:18:00]  Dude  My  My leg  I've never been in that kind of pain before  Holy shit  It's basically like getting hit with a bat  For  21 minutes  And  Not being able to move  You know  And  I've broken my hands in competition  I fought Mike Brown  With  I broke  Two bones in my right hand  You know  In the first round  And dislocated my thumb  In the third round  I was fighting with no hands  For  You know  20 something minutes  That  Leg kick on the soft tissue  Is just like getting hit with a bat  Over and over and over again 
[03:18:30]  Oh my god  It was in the thigh right  Yeah  It was  From like the hip  To the lower calf  And my leg turned a different color  It was like a bloated  I liked watching that on Twitter  Yeah  The updates on Twitter  Yeah  It was pretty nasty  Oh yeah  Like it changed colors  Over like three weeks  Like went from like  Just really red  To then purple  Then black  And then  Wow  Little green in there for a while  Little green  Yeah  It was nasty  But yeah  I would fight him  I'd fight anybody  How long did that take  To get over  About a month and a half  A month and a half  I didn't break anything  There was no structural damage 
[03:19:00]  I had no ligaments or anything  It was just  Like a big ass bruise  We see that all the time  You always see leg kicks  You're all going  That's good  He's going for the leg kicks  And it doesn't look  Effective  Like from the outside  You know it is  Because I took one  From John Jones  Just to see  It's horrendous  I almost vomited  It was really upsetting  Oh yeah  It's bad  And the fact that you  Could take that  For X amount of rounds  And you were really  It was like a movie scene  That you were just  Like hopping around  On one leg  It was bad man  It was bad  There was two rounds  Of that where I was 
[03:19:30]  Just basically  Out of the fight  Because my leg  Was taken out of it  And he's a bigger guy  Than I am  You know  I've been at  135 pounds  For my last four fights  But I started in this sport  In 2003  And I talk about it  In the book also  This is before  California had legalized MMA  This is before  There was a big  You know  Fan base  There was no  It wasn't on TV  I was fighting  In any casinos  And I had to go up  Two weight classes  In order to even get a fight  And so I became 
[03:20:00]  A world champion  At 145 pounds  And the fights I fought  Were because  I was one of the top guys  At 145  But I'm a 35 pounder  I was a 133 pounder  In college  For five years  And so he's  About 10-15 pounds  Bigger than I am  And just kicking  The crap out of my leg  I mean  It was painful  And I would do it again  I would just make sure  That my leg was out of the way  Maybe go south  Off a little bit  Be a little more desperate  For a takedown  Right off the bat  But you know 
[03:20:30]  I'm back at  Where I should be now  At 135 pounds  Is it possible  You could talk to him  Before the fight  And go look  The leg thing  That happened last time  Was really unpleasant  We did that already  We don't have to do that again  Maybe you can make a pact  Like you avoid my legs  And I'll avoid your legs  That's a great idea  It's like linemen  Will do that sometimes  In football  Like defensive linemen  Offensive linemen  Will kind of have  An unspoken thing  I guess  Where they're not going  To completely kill each other  Or don't you guys have that  With certain foot stomps  Like up against the cage  Like it's just like  You're not stepping on mine  So I'm not going to  Completely step on yours 
[03:21:00]  You know  I don't know about that  I think you're not  Supposed to kick  Like to the front of the knee  Or something like that  Sometimes it's legal  It's just like  Bad taste to do it  But  No there's no rule  About that  I don't think  Oh no not a rule  But like something like  Two guys  Like an unspoken thing  Like yeah  Like when you're up against the cage  Two pussies making a fucking agreement  That they're not going to  Fuck each other up  I wasn't going to phrase it like that  But  It's like two gentlemen  They're making an agreement  About to step on each other's feet  While they're fist fighting  I think it's a fair thing  Because nobody wants 
[03:21:30]  To fucking footstep  On  Sticks  But it really is unpleasant  Oh it's gotta be  Is that the most unpleasant thing?  To just get a footstop?  Yeah what is the worst thing?  I mean it obviously all hurts  But what is the one thing  That you're like  Oh fuck  Not that  Not that  Jeez I don't  I get like  Black out during fights  When it comes to the pain factor  Oh really?  But what's the one thing  You just don't want?  I guess it would be like  Maybe just getting hit directly  In the nose  Or like eyes water  Or something like that  Oh man 
[03:22:00]  You know that's like  Just uncomfortable  A little bit  That's a terrible feeling  Yeah  That whole  Have your nose  Nose punch  Makes you all fuzzy  Yeah  Kind of hurts all around your eyes  I'm always amazed  That somebody can get kicked  In the face or head  And continue  You know  It's called men  That's even  Even beyond being men  Like I mean  Obviously yes Anthony  It's a good point  But you can't wrap your head around it  I just can't comprehend  That you guys can continue  After some of those hits you take  Like a John Jones elbow or something 
[03:22:30]  Those pointy elbows of his  Look just annoying  Or the last fight  Kane and Antonio Silva  It was a bloody beating  Oh my god  He got him  But he  Silva stayed in there for almost a round  Yeah  Taking Kane Velasquez's elbows to the face  Yeah it was like  Someone butchered a big cow or something  Yeah it was a mess  He was so big too  It was just like  Alright we need to sew this guy up  Like now  Whoring out  Do you  When you fight  If somebody else's blood gets on you  Like I know you've been tested  And they've been tested  But does it on any level 
[03:23:00]  Disgust you or worry  That you're getting somebody else's blood  In your mouth or your eyes  For whatever reason it doesn't  Do you ever watch BJ Panhill  Sometimes lick the blood  Which that  Kind of goes  Does he really  Yeah he's done that before  When he beat Matt Hughes  He like  Licked the blood off his glove  Holy  Which is kind of crazy  But you know  To each their own  I won't even do that  If I'm dating somebody  I'm like look  For the next four days  You sleep on the couch  The old Red Wings  The Red Wings  Never happened  I can see doing that  During the fight 
[03:23:30]  Psychologically  To fucking  Fuck the other person up  Like but after the fight  Why would you do it  I don't know  I don't know  To send a message  To the people watching  Yeah yeah  Oh here it is  For the next people  Oh it's just a photo  What a wreck  First step to recovery  BJ Penn admits  Blood licking problem  He's got a problem  He's got a problem  He's got a problem  He's addicted to it  The first step  Is awareness  Yes  And hopefully  You don't pick up  Any hepatitis  Or something  Is there something  I think we talked  About this last time  But Rogan  Had talked about 
[03:24:00]  After you like  Do you worry about  Picking up something  From the mat  Like he said  That there's things  Like face herpes  And all this weird  Shit that people  Can get  Because you're  Grinding on the mat  Will you use  Special soap after that  To avoid that type of shit  Not in a  I mean that's not  Like the main concern  In a fight  When they have a fight  It's like a brand new canvas  And  Or even training  No training  Yeah you make sure  I mean washing the mats  And all that kind of stuff  Is super important  You want to  You know  Shower afterwards  And stuff  It's like  You know  It's a grimy thing  You're rolling around 
[03:24:30]  On the ground  Fighting other guys  And stuff like that  It can be pretty brutal  There's a rumor too  Is it true  Is there a gay fighter  In the UFC  Or is that just a rumor  That people were spreading  It's not in the UFC  There was a  There was a guy  That tried out  For the show  That I was just on  I was just coaching  The ultimate fighter  And he  Had done gay porn  Oh right  He had been in  Like a bunch of films  And supposedly  Was not gay  I don't know how  That works exactly  But was  In like multiple  Like 
[03:25:00]  Receiving end  Wow  Male pornography  Oh no  And then saying  He's not gay  You know what though  Hold on  Devil's acting  Let's hear your story  Perhaps  If you're not gay  You have to be  On the receiving end  Because it's unpleasant  But you're not gay  So you will not be able  To be on the giving end  Because like  You might not be able  To physically  Get yourself  To be erect  To have sex  So you may hate it  But receiving  May be your only option  Uh no  Wow 
[03:25:30]  Apparently he was  On both ends  Oh  On many occasions  Well anyways  He tried out for the show  And he lost  Oh wow  So he wasn't on the show  And didn't get his opportunity  To fight in the UFC  If we were in court right now  Do you know how mad  My fellow prosecutor would be  That I asked a question  That I didn't know the answer to  Like they'd be like  Why didn't you research that  And know that stupid  You just made a terrible point  It was like when fucking  Darden told OJ  To put the glove on  It's like you should have known  What are you thinking  You don't just do that  Oh okay so he lost  And uh  And I saw some of the uh  Cause my on demand  Is fucked up  Like uh 
[03:26:00]  I don't know how to explain this to you  But my  It's like  The only thing that it tapes right  Is Game of Thrones  I tried to tape  Uh  You and Dominic Cruz this year  And it was just taping  All these  These specials  But it didn't tape the episodes  So I didn't get to watch them  Really irritated  You blew it  Technological  I really did  Now you're in uh  Fighting shape  You're ready to fight  Uh  Will you still train  For the next few weeks  Or are you done  No yeah  I'll be training hard  I'll be back to Sacramento  In a couple days  And be on it  You know hard  I've got this book tour  I'm doing a book signing tonight  At bookends in New Jersey  Oh right

[03:29:30]  Travis's mom  Travis  His mother  When Travis was 20 or 21  Became religious  Like an ultra-Jewish  Orthodox religion  She met a rabbi  And completely left her family  And he has not seen her  In 10 years  Like she's just gone  She disappeared  Yeah it's like  Seriously like  Something goes on  I can't remember  It's been a long time  Since I was in college  But it was like  Like something that  Happens fairly  Not like often  But it happens in common  Often if they gave it a name  Or something  Yeah right yeah  Wow yeah  Would you  We always do something 
[03:30:00]  And I think we're  Ending the show  Oh go  You always do  Some kind of move  And the last time  You bent my arm  Which hurt a lot  Yeah the gay maker  Remember  Yeah it was very unpleasant  I didn't care for it  Did it work  Are you gay now  No no no  It actually straightened  Guys out there everywhere  Guys out there everywhere  On the beach  Are sobbing right now  Yeah  But I would like to take  I took the last time  We had  I've gotten punched  A couple times  But only in the arm  And believe me  With Frankie Edgar  And Rashad 
[03:30:30]  And who  Jones  Oh boy did Jones  Put a fucking  But he likes it  Yeah  He's like  He's a nice guy  But he's just sadistic  Yeah he's a little bit sadistic  Yeah there's a reason  He's the champion  Like you can see  How can you be such a nice guy  And fight  And then he fucking  Puts you in a necklock  He's like  Oh this little guy  Is going to let me kick him  Oh here it goes  Yeah  And he goes  I should have kicked you harder  I'm like that's a good point  And he holds it a little longer  After you tap too  A little longer  He's the one guy  That holds it a little longer  Would you hit me  Not as hard as you can  But in the right arm  But let me just tighten up 
[03:31:00]  A little bit  Here's what's upsetting  I said would you  Before I got the sentence out  His fist is close  He was making a fist  Like yeah I could do this  I fucking hate when these guys  Are in fight mode  Like when they have a fight  Coming up  Like you want to get them  After a fight  When they're bruised  And relaxed  And feeling peaceful  But alright  Yeah just not  Okay  Okay  Not as hard  Oh no  I'm not gonna do this hard  Jimmy move your arm  Yeah sure  Why do you need to see me  Falling off the chair  Hell yeah  Okay  Maybe I should elbow him instead  Save my hand  Save my hand  Oh you believe me  You're not hitting a hard target 
[03:31:30]  With my fucking arm  I'm making a muscle  It's looking like hitting a fucking  I'm not gonna do this hard  Okay thank you  Ready  You know what  I actually physically jumped  An elbow would be too hard  I think to take  Elbow  No  Yeah don't do an elbow actually  No  I don't wanna hit you  No I don't mind though  It's in the spirit of  Just as long as you're not  Beating off while I do this  Yeah right  He's got a big fucking heart on  He's got a Cialis rod 
[03:32:00]  He's like  Just one more time  Oh yeah  Are you a lefty or a righty  Are you a lefty  I'm a righty  Oh you are righty  I know you've fought southpaw before  Yeah  Alright I'm gonna take one  On my left arm  Yeah  Cause the punches  Even when they hurt  You can like  You can survive them  I won't take an elbow  He's loving life  No no no  But I don't  How about an elbow Jimmy  No no  Elbow is too much  An elbow is too much  But I'll take another punch  You can go harder 
[03:32:30]  But don't put it all in  He's trying to figure this out  Yeah  Into a conflict  Okay  A little harder  Yeah  Ready  Yeah  Okay  How  No  Oh fuck  The headphones  Take the headphones off  No don't cock  Alright  Here we go  Oh shit  Oh  Oh man  I heard that  That was a good one  Wow  Does that hurt Jimmy  Does anybody else in here  Want to get hit  No I'm sorry  I'm good  Hope you want to take one  Dude  Dude  Dude that made a 
[03:33:00]  Thud sound  Yeah  That's fucking  Oh man  Wow  That sounded like a fight  But when you watch  These things  And I've said this  Every time I've done it  It's a new respect  Because you understand  Something  Even on a minor level  Yeah  Like he was being friendly  And hitting me in the arm  Not as hard as he could  Of course  How many percent there  Or whatever  Oh man  That's gonna bruise nice  Jimmy let me see  Pull it up  That was 60-70  I'm thinking  It's already  Already started changing color  Yeah  How hard was that 
[03:33:30]  Oh my god  I don't know  Not that hard  50  It wasn't  Yeah probably  Yeah probably 50 percent  Oh man  And that was in the  And I tighten up the arm  That's gonna bruise  It's a lovely  You got to tweet a picture  Of the bruise  Oh I will  I do  Every time  Oh yeah  He rocks got the sound  I want to hear this again  Okay  Oh fuck  The headphones  No don't cock  Alright  Here we go  Oh  It's that  Yeah  It's like a pop almost  It sounded like the love scene  In Raging Bull  That really fucking hurt 
[03:34:00]  That was a  But again  To fucking  To know you're gonna get in  And take that  On the fucking jaw  Oh please  Imagine that  To your face  No  I'm amazed  That anybody can take that  I don't know if we're allowed to do this  But there is a marine out there  That is a huge fan  That wanted to get hit  Oh I don't want to get  I don't want to hit him  He's a huge fan  He's a civilian  I can't be hitting people  Yeah you don't get in trouble  I just  Suggested  Look at he's all excited  He's ready  Big guy  He's like  Come on bring it  Next thing you know  Uriah's in course  Yeah right  He flashbacks to the war 
[03:34:30]  He's got  Oh man  It's already  It's already  That's gonna be lovely  Imagine getting that in the face  That's the amazing part of it  And then they keep fighting  I don't get it  They keep fucking  Once in a while  They fall  But there are guys  That will take three rounds  Of that  And then eventually  You get them at one  But how do you take that  What's that about  I don't get it  Hey isn't it crazy  You see  You see with boxing also  You see all these  Big hits  Big hits  Big hits  And it's just a little tiny one  On the chin  That puts a guy  Yeah that'll lay him out 
[03:35:00]  It's crazy about  I mean that's why  You gotta aim  If you guys are ever  Gonna get a street fight  Aim for the chin  Upper lip  Right here at the jaw  It puts guys out  That's where it is  You hit them hard  Yeah  You can just  Dink  It's amazing  Who can take the best punch  You've ever thrown  I'm sure you've hit guys  When you hit somebody  Hard  And you know you get them hard  And you get them right  Where you want them  And they come right back  It psychologically has to  Bother you on some level  Yeah a little bit  But you know  It just makes you want  To hit them more 
[03:35:30]  So it works out  That's the difference  Between him and me  What is it about  What they call  The button  Getting hit on the jaw  Yeah on the chin  Right on the kisser  I think it has to do  With some wiring there  The connecting of the jaw  And like the  The shaking of everything  The battle  And there's some nerves in there  You can take a good punch though  I mean  Oh yeah  This chin  This chin's famous  Yeah you got a chin  You got the chin  The chin is made  For a fighter  That's right  It looks like  There's a picture of him  As a baby  And he's got it  It's two days old 
[03:36:00]  With that chin  And he's already got the chin  But you need that  Like these guys  When you see a lot of them  Like Velasquez  And a lot of these guys  Have like these fucking  Neanderthal ridge  Like they're built to take shots  Where you gotta have a jaw like that  Where like  Like a Chuck Liddell type jaw  Where you're just made  To take fucking punishment  I on the other hand  Do not have that gift  Or an arm  Let me see the arm again  It's okay for now  But I can feel it  That really hurts  Yeah that really hurts  But you know  It's a war wound  I'll lie about what happened  I'll be like  He fucking got in my  Alright 
[03:36:30]  Tonight  We're wrapping up here  Tonight you can see  Uriah  At bookends in New Jersey  At 7 o'clock  To sign his book  It's called  The Law of the Ring  And the parts I've read  I've read a good piece of it  It's actually excellent  The street fight alone  With all the details  Yeah  And it's a really frightening thing  That we've all heard about  And it's a very detailed thing  And it was something  That you probably  Should have died from  I mean those guys  Literally were trying to kill you  Yeah crazy  And also  UFC 148  Uriah  Do you keep in touch  With those guys  Oh yeah  To send Christmas cards  Yeah thanks 
[03:37:00]  I'm curious if I go back there  If they'll recognize me  Oh man  I mean it's been some years  Yeah  They got other white guys  To worry about  Right  To kick their ass  But at the end of it  You make some interesting points  About why they might have done that  Which is stuff  That I wouldn't have thought of  So it actually had  Like a logical conclusion  To it  Oh cool  Yeah  And you're fighting at 148  Co-headline event  Co-made event  With Silva Son  Against  How do you say his name  Milan  Henan Baral  Henan Baral  I was way off  Portuguese with an R as an H  Oh yeah  It's kind of weird

[03:41:30]  On the virus  Sirius XM  So people  Wow  What a big thing  To talk about though  Twitter  Woof  You gotta love the Twitter  When you get a  Non-event like  Alright  It was a 5'9  Magnitude  Earthquake  East Coast  Rarely happens  Well that's what  This film  That we're working on  Is gonna be all about  The different experiences  I feel like  For me  It's sort of  The rebuilding process 
[03:42:00]  And my fiancee  Was at work  So thank god  She didn't have to  See the damage  First hand  I was able to  Brace her  Before she came  In the door  Yeah  Because that's  Something that  Stays with you  Yeah  You know  You can't  Unsee  This  Two action figures  I'll bet you  She knocked them over  Before she went to work  And there happened to be  An earthquake  She just looked at that  Dumb display  And she went  I'll be every morning  Before she goes  She fucking flicks  One with her finger  Fucking asshole  Or she just kicks  The side of the shelf  Yeah  I bet you there's been  Plenty of times 
[03:42:30]  Where all of them  Were knocked over  And she's like  I just don't want to  Hear his mouth  But without the coincidence  Of the earthquake  You didn't even give it  A second thought  Just set him back up  Going like  It must have been  Something  I don't know  Loose articulation  In the ankles  Yes  It's just  That is  You are so immature  It's  It's adorable  Wow  Where's Mick Foley  That's the Smackdown shelf  So Mick Foley's not  How many shelves do you have  Wait wait wait  What  You have them segregated  Obviously 
[03:43:00]  And  Obviously  And there were people  Who noticed  You see Cody Rhodes  There wearing the championship belt  I don't know who that is  I'm saying  Now you do  Looks like some guy  Named Dom  But he is the current  Champion  So people  On Twitter  Noticed that I changed  The belt  Oh you changed the belt  As the titles  Change in life  Who's the champion  Wow  That would let us know  That that is an accurate  Time wise  Yeah  I couldn't have  I couldn't have predicted that  So you don't put the rock 
[03:43:30]  In there  Is the rock in there  The rock's  A shelf below  On the legends  Shelf  Yeah  What shelves do you have  Yeah  It's a tall bookshelf  So there's like  Five shelves  On the shelf  And you're  You have wrestling figures  Never  How do they get  They get dusty right  Dusty roads  Dusty roads is there  Yes  Where's that  Under the  Fucking  Questionable preference  Shelf  I mean  Yeah  They get dusty  If it gets bad 
[03:44:00]  I'll use one of the  Whatever  Swiffer things  What  You know  What are you  The help  Get a fucking  The little air thing  And blow the air thing  Do you know the air thing  That you clean your computer  Dusty  Your computer keyboard  Those you should use  I find Swiffer  Does a better job  How does he work  With a Swiffer  You know  You just use the cloth  A cloth  On the fucking thing  They probably all fall over  Then you gotta pick them up  Each one individually  Well the air thing  You have weakly articulated ankles  Exactly  The air thing 
[03:44:30]  Would probably  Knock some of them over  Oh would you love  My glass display  That I have in my apartment  I have a glass display thing  Which I was just  It shouldn't  I spent way too much money  Oh he would love that right  Yeah it's fucking perfect  For what you have  I know  I've seen it  Oh you have  Yeah  That'd be great  For your wrestling figures  I know  But then the earthquake  Probably would have  Like shaken that  And they all would have  Fallen over  And then I would have  Had to go into  The glass shelf  That would have been  Wow  Oh my god  Don't even speak of it  Wow  Does she like the shelves  She doesn't mind  Oh  She'd probably rather  Put anything there 
[03:45:00]  Just books about  Clitoral circumcision  Anything more enjoyable  To look at  Than these figures  Well she prefers  That there is  One shelving you  As opposed to  Figures everywhere  Just  Would you put them  Everywhere if you could  Well I already do  Like  Extend it out  Like  Akeem the African dream  And Macho Man Randy Savage  Stand next to the television  Why  Because I like them  And they stand next to the TV  And you can see them  While you're watching television  You can glance over  And be like  Those are my favorites  I like those guys  Right now 
[03:45:30]  Maybe they'll  Change positions  Oh  Are these all the same size  Yeah  They're all to scale  It's all the same figure  Right  I mean the same series  Yeah it's the same series  It's all Mattel  How tall is each one  Yeah that would be stupid  Jimmy to have different ones  I remember one year ago  I used to collect dolls like this  Dolls  We'll go action figures  They're not doing anything  Yeah the lack of that  Exactly  They fall down  When you fucking  It's a little shake  They're atrophied figures  That's all they do  But I had like the thing 
[03:46:00]  And the Fantastic Four  And this is in the 70s  But then they made  Bigger Hulk dolls  And I hated the bigger ones  Because it didn't match  It doesn't make any sense anymore  I mean the big show  Of course  Is going to be about  A seven inch figure  But your average for you  Would be about six inches  Are they a scale  To each other  Like is the big show  Bigger than the rest  Of these action figures  Oh yeah they're to scale  Oh well that's interesting  Mattel does a great job  That's interesting  Because then they can't  Just mold all the body parts  For one thing  And then just pop  Different heads on them 
[03:46:30]  Right I mean they do  Share some of the  I don't care  Okay  I like the arms on this one  Are exactly the same  As the arms on that one  Yeah  Fucking  Yeah they do  Who's the guy  In the red shorts over there  That's Tyson Kidd  I don't know  Who any of these guys are  I know  Where's fucking Ivan Putzky  They don't have an Ivan Putzky  Yet  I mean maybe he'll come out  Why don't they do Legends  Why don't George Animal Steel  And do Legends  I have a George Animal Steel  He's a shelf  Why wouldn't you  Who else is there  I mean  There's four or five shelves worth  I've never wanted to 
[03:47:00]  Knock shelves over  Containing anything as badly  You should clean the dust  Off of them with a shotgun  Yeah  There were a few  Fun thing to do  How do I repair this  There were some that said  With a blow torch  There were some that said  With a shotgun  Though they weren't being helpful  But for the majority of people  Were sensitive  I don't think kids would buy  An Ivan Putzky figure  You're probably right  But it's not all about the money  Is it when you're making  Real legends  You're gonna make real legends  It's true  There is some integrity  To the line  Right  And kids don't buy this either  Fucking adults 
[03:47:30]  That's right  E-Rock would you own  Any of these  Would he  I own a couple  Not to the scale  That Sam does though  You don't own nearly as many  Nowhere near  Does E-Rock know a lot  About wrestling  I mean he knows  Like he's a wrestling fan  Yes  But I mean  I'm not as in depth  Or intense as Sam is  I think Sam's a little OCD  I think Sam's a little OCD  And I get it  I'm the same with other stuff  But I think Sam's a bit OCD  With this collection  Well there was one  Like when I got  I used to  When I was a kid 
[03:48:00]  Buy every single figure  Like repaints  Every single one  And at some point  When I got older  And it's still difficult  To this day  Had to say  One of each guy  That is made  So I don't need to get  Every Undertaker  I have an Undertaker  So was it like  Toy Story 3  I didn't see  Toy Story 3  You gave your little  Dolls away  No no I didn't  Give them away  What did you do  They're in my parents' house  I mean they're literally  Closets and closets  And closets  I'm talking about  You wanna  Here's what you  Closets  Sometimes something like this  You could probably make 
[03:48:30]  Some kind of  I don't know who would  Give a fuck  But it'd be a cool display  If you could set it up  But then again  There's probably people  That have more stuff than you  Right  Like dolls and stuff  I mean action figures  Dolls  A whole bunch of stuff  But yeah  There has to be people  Who have larger collections  Than me  But I have a fairly  Extensive wrestling  But you still  And you buy like  All the dolls  Like you buy  Like these people  Are  Well I buy current  Action figures  They're nobodies  I go into  Well no  Yoshitatsu  Maybe Seamus  Is a main event guy  I know  But this kid  This kid guy  Like you don't need 
[03:49:00]  That doll  Look at the action  Figure positioning  You see how he's  Towards the back  Of the shelf  The main event guys  Are gonna be at the front  Are there any dolls  You don't have  That you want to buy  Well there's  Dolls  There's lots of  Action figures  What  Action figure  Action figure  That you don't have  Yet  I mean  And they keep making them  What's the next doll  Purchase you'll make  Well I am looking for  A Bam Bam Bigelow  Action figure  From the legends  Bam Bam Bigelow  How much do these dolls  Run  The action figures  The current ones  Are like 
[03:49:30]  12  13  14 bucks  That's not bad  Alright  And the legends  Are a little more expensive  You're talking 17  18 dollars  Now let me  This would actually  Be a cool  As much as I want  To smash Sam  I do get this  I get it  I completely get it  Here's where this  Would be cool  If you had  In a garbage can  How great would they be  With fucking  Just garbage juice  And pigeon shit  Scraped out macaroni  That you didn't eat  Just laying on their faces 
[03:50:00]  Fucking meatloaf  Come on Jess  Man up already  Get rid of this shit  I'd be super pissed  But if you had  If you had a basement  Like a house  With a basement  Yeah  And you could get  Like a wall display  Where they were  Along the wall  In kind of a glass  Display  Case  That's why  I've always wanted  To do that  Because I have  All the collections  From when I was  Younger dreams  Yeah  That's not my dream  It's just something  Would you like to buy  Some of the repaints  Yeah I mean  If I had the money  I would buy more  What is  You need a raise 
[03:50:30]  Why don't you just  Not buy these dolls  And then just buy  The ones that you  Really want  The action figures  That I buy  Are the ones  That have the priority  Of course  What is  Maybe we can go  On ebay or something  I'm curious  As to what is  The  Like I don't remember  Where those dolls  That I had  When I was a kid  Are  But I still love them  I remember the packaging  They came in  Those little  Marvel comics ones  Yeah  If you're kind of OCD  It's like  Yeah  You know you have  To have them all  Yeah  What is the fucking  Get for a wrestling doll  Alright well I just  Ebayed wrestling doll  Well you're not going to get  Action figures  Action figures  The better  Result 
[03:51:00]  There you go  Hulk Hogan  Talking wrestling doll  I had that  Of course  I don't think it talks anymore  Go to her price  Thank god  I wish the real Hulk  Was like that  Yeah  It doesn't talk anymore  The Hulkster and Heaven doll  It's a little box  With a fucking tear on it  A little fucking dopey kid  Yeah there's just one  Empty seat with a W  Because it's Wembley  Wembley  In Wembley  374 wrestling figure collection  With free bonuses  $1300  That's a starting bid 
[03:51:30]  Nobody's bid on it  Let me see  Wow  Is that the most expensive one?  No there's a single  Oh wow  That's a whole Hasbro collection  I have  I think I have  Every single one  Oh boy  Is that really hard to get?  Some of them are  Some of them not  Those are probably harder  When they're in the box  But at least you take them  Out of the box  You're not just collecting them  I got bad though  When I was like  13 or 14  For about a year  I bought two of every  Single figure that came out  One in the thing  Yeah  Or you keep one of the box  I have like boxes at home 
[03:52:00]  That's why you don't eat  Certain foods  And that's why  You have a sickness  From being overly mothers  I'm surprised that's the only box  You don't get into  Or do get into  Shit  That's alright  Is this worth $1500?  I don't have any of the  Rock and Wrestling series  Would you want them?  Yeah  Why?  Because I don't have them  Rock and Wrestling is like  The cartoon  And so they look more cartoony  I don't have anything from that  Why are they so expensive?  This one is for $1500  Well the Rock and Wrestling set  You don't see that very often  Especially in the box  And the box is in perfect condition 
[03:52:30]  What is  I think with  Star Wars ones too  Oh yeah  I think with the original Star Wars  Which we all had  The  What were the sand ones?  Sand people  Yeah I think that was  The sand people  The little guy  Is the fucking  The hardest one to get  In the box  Oh the Jawas  The Jawas  The Jawa they call  Yeah yeah yeah  With the hoods  Yeah it's one of them  In the box  Is real  I saw a Star Wars poster  I forget how much  An original art poster  For thousands of fucking dollars  Oh yeah there it is 
[03:53:00]  For like  There you go  One sold for $910  $910  That's loose though  I think they were even more than that  That's loose  In the box there  $750  But they're graded too  So like  Yes  Like everything  Jam in tan  They do that for everything now  Are these the Somalia 1978  Um  Unpunch  What's that mean?  There's probably not a hole punch  I'm assuming  Oh okay  We're selling  Faggy wrestling dolls  Faggy wrestling dolls  For any faggot 
[03:53:30]  That wants one  What's ironic is  That is what Don West  Is selling now  Is he doing that now?  I don't buy the TNA figure  Look at this doll  Let's open it up  Check it out  It's another unknown wrestler  Another has been  Is that what  Is that what he's doing?  He's not  Not in those words  But yeah  He is selling TNA action figures  Like and selling them like that  Who are some of the people in TNA?  Well Mick Foley was  He's gone now  Ah  Hulk Hogan 
[03:54:00]  Has TNA figure  Oh well  Jeff Hardy's there  Why don't you get these?  The Hardy boys  Kurt Angle  Rob Van Dam  The TNA guys  That's  You gotta cut the line some places  Now it's  And that's where you drew the line in the sand?  There was a time when I would have gotten  The TNA guys  Because I needed every wrestling figure  But I don't get anything from TNA  I should buy them  Because I would like to buy them  Just to break them in front of Sam  Oh yeah  Upset me  God  Why would you just give them to me?  I don't know  Big boss man  Comes with an exploding heart 
[03:54:30]  Oh jeez  His heart explodes  Quite the action figure  Duh  Dependent on how fair he like you are  They could have a whole line of exploding heart  Oh yeah  Exactly  Holy shit  I did just get the British Bulldog  The British Bulldog  His heart explodes too  Be dialing people  Be dialing  911 for the action figure  I had to get two more by the end of the month 
[03:55:00]  Comes with a flatline EKG  I had to buy two more from Toys R Us  By the end of the month  Because they're doing a deal  Where if you buy four  And you send the UPCs in  You get a free Vince McMahon  Oh wow  Mattel has not made a Vince McMahon  And so far I've bought six  So I need two more  So I can get two  And leave one  Of course package  Oh you still do that?  Well just for the special ones 
[03:55:30]  Is that going to be worth anything?  I like the special ones  I would like to have one in the box  What piece of wrestling paraphernalia  Would you like to have  That you've seen?  Because your chair is pretty cool  That's signed by all those people  Right  I would like  I don't have  Anything I don't think  Ring used  Wrestling gear  Like tights  Oh okay  Boots  Of course  Things like that  That's what I would really like to have  Those are hard to get  Get the Macho Man in a Bronco  Macho Man in a Bronco  Whiskey bottle included in this one people 
[03:56:00]  Tree sold separately  Tree sold separately  But we're going to throw it in  If you buy it on Flex Pay  I have that old Vince McMahon  That's sold for $125  Oh I don't have it packaged  That's the old LJN Vince McMahon  Maniacal Chris Benoit  Maniacal Chris Benoit  Maniacal Chris Benoit  And his dead family  Buy it now people 
[03:56:30]  This isn't going to last  Just like his family  Three pack?  It's a three pack  Still in the box  The wooden ones  That they were buried in  Bedailing the SWAT team  It's horrible  Terrible  Say something like that  Trying to talk about the damage  From the earthquake  I didn't think we were going to get into  Chris Benoit's family  Well you know  It's tragedy  Tragedy 
[03:57:00]  We're doing a tragedy break  Yeah  I would need though  I mean  A giant  If I actually wanted to display  Everything I have  Including the figures  I mean I'd need a humongous basement  Why would you put them in the basement?  Prominently displayed  That's a cool place to put them  Prominently displayed  There will one day be a Sam Roberts house  With a Sam Roberts man cave  And by man cave I mean  A room where I put  Your asshole  No  No  I would love that 
[03:57:30]  If somebody broke into your house  With a gun  And like  In Livian the marathon man  You could only keep the action figures  That you could swallow  Or shove in your asshole  And then he could keep  The whole collection  Exactly  Jess would also start to ask  For some of her stuff  Like I don't know  There's so much room in there  Can you bring my shoes?  Get the Pat Patterson  And the ring boy doll  With working genitalia  Articulated genitalia  And look 
[03:58:00]  His hand fits right on the ass  And locks in  Locks in  To his ass  Pat Patterson  With articulated penis  If you become a rack  I would buy some of those  If they were advertised like that  Poor taste wrestling action figures  Yes  That's great 
[03:58:30]  Now what  Jess cannot like this  As a beautiful young woman  She likes  She seems to like  The better things in life  Yes she does  But what I  She doesn't mind it  Like she likes that I have passions  Yeah  And I also try to  Point out  Action figures  Of things that she likes  Yeah  For instance  She always liked  Twilight Zone growing up  So I go  Oh look how cool  This action figure is  And she'll feign interest 
[03:59:00]  But you know  It's not her thing  She doesn't care  I wish  I envy people  Who don't like that stuff  Like I love it  As much as I  I get it  And I wish I didn't get it  I wish I was like  You're a cunt  But I fucking get it  Of things  Yeah  All the time  I wish I could just clear  Everything out of the apartment  And just get rid of everything I own  But there's no way  I can get rid of this stuff  Do you know how many people  Have seen my stuff  And just go  It's like a museum in here  Yeah  I frame everything  And it has to be  It takes the fun out of life  Like I obsess over nothing  It's so stupid 
[03:59:30]  But once it's all up there  It's nice to have  Right  Yeah I guess so  Because I got into that movie poster thing  Now I'm like fully  Fully  But you have a finished basement  With a movie theater  And maybe six or seven posters  Tastefully done  Ange picked out  Of course I fucking saw the frames  That Ange picked out  And now I want to burn my own apartment  To the ground  I gotta go buy the frames  The museum glass  No glare  I go with that stuff of course  But I mean  You've got to  Yeah the frames are beautiful  That she picked out for him  What are we on a molly  If posters were like 
[04:00:00]  What I was into  The wall would be covered in frames  And posters  Like you wouldn't see a wall  It would just be posters  And that's not tastefully done  I was like that as a kid  With my kiss stuff  And I was always jealous  Of my friend James  Because his mother  Let him put on the ceiling  In his room  So his ceiling and walls  Were covered  But my parents would never  Let me touch the ceiling  Like once in a while  I'd start doing the ceiling  And just until they  Told me to take shit down  I get furiously jealous  When I see people  With better  With wrestling collections  That have stuff  That I don't have  Like who's one  Or what have you seen  That's one that you really like 
[04:00:30]  That you didn't  Well this is a good one  You're not gonna believe  The deal we got  It's the masturbating  Cuckold Hulk Hogan  With his wife  With double penetration action  DP action  Masturbating cuckold Hulk Hogan  Action figure doll  Is there a British  The Barber Beefcake Hulk Hogan  Two pack?

[04:07:00]  Old action figures  Show me a really  Old one  Snap into an  Oak tree  If you just  Google image  Hasbro or  LJN  WWF  You'll find it  Every time we  Click back on that  Fucking awful  Shelf collection  Just standing there  On that fucking  Homemade woodshop  Shelf  That's humiliating  For them  What are those  Figures  They look  Caricature-ish  Those are the  Hasbros  Those are from  When like  Travis and me  Were growing up  Just after the  LJN  Jake the Snake  Roberts 
[04:07:30]  A little trivia  For you Anthony  Yes  That Jake the Snake  Roberts  Was my first  Wrestling action figure  Wow  Are these worth  Money  Some of them  Are  Andre the Giant  Is worth money  I would say  The big boss  Man ones  Well the big  Boss fans  In a box  Are the dead ones  More valuable  Than the living  Wrestlers  Not always  No  No  It has more to do  With the figure  Than the wrestler  Now what is the 
[04:08:00]  Let me ask you  How much is the  Andre worth  What is the most  Valuable wrestling  Figure  Like with comic books  People could say  Well it's the  Action comics  Number one  Or it's with  Baseball cards  It's the  Honus Wagner  What is the  Fucking Honus  Wagner of this  I don't know  If there is  One per se  But like in this  Line the Andre  Is pretty rare  In the box  It's probably like  You could probably  Get one for like  Ninety dollars  That's it  Yeah it's not  I mean  They came out  In like  1989  So it's not like  It's that old  Yeah the thing  About these figures  Is that there's  So many of them  Right  They're mass produced 
[04:08:30]  Yeah in the box  They're probably worth  A little more  But like  Everybody had these  Okay so what is one  That wasn't mass produced  Like a fucking  An old dusty road  Or a magazine  Or something  What's an old  Wrestling thing  That's really worth money  Well I mean  It would probably be  Like ring used gear  Goes for a lot of money  Is there anybody  On the phone  That knows  That's all these  People trash  Oh I know  Of course  But is there anybody  Who actually is a collector  That knows  I don't know  Jim's saying you don't  Know anything about wrestling  Let's get somebody  On the phone  I know lots about wrestling  You do but you don't  Know anything about  The action figure value  You're just pointing 
[04:09:00]  At your heroes  And going yay  Fucking such  Well they're not  Like there is no  Super like  Thousand dollar action figure  You're saying there's  There's no one  That you're looking at  And the Star Wars one  Is that little guy  I don't know why  Now I'm interested in this  Like there's not a huge  Because collectibles  Are cool  Yeah  They all collect things  But they're not  It's funny  Like since  Even maybe 89  Or it started  But baseball cards  From before then  Before people knew  But then after that  Everybody knew to save them  Everyone knew to save them  They pumped out a fuckload  Under different names  And they would make them  Like 400 bucks  In meat  Like these shitty 
[04:09:30]  Don Russ fucking cards  Or all these  It's like nobody  What are you doing  Oh </pre>
