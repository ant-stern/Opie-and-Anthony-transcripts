<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts reminiscing about their old XM studio, recalling elaborate pranks like "sidewalk fishing" (dropping sex toys and pornography onto the sidewalk) and a particularly memorable stunt involving a box labeled "free puppies" containing gay pornography.  They lamented the stricter rules regarding intern interactions, marking the end of their supposed 50-year-old tradition of hazing.  A discussion about malfunctioning equipment, specifically a lack of batteries, ensued, leading to humorous anecdotes about battery-saving techniques and childhood memories.  The hosts recalled a past stunt involving an intern eating excessive candy after Halloween, highlighting how such antics would be prohibited today. A listener called, observing a shift in the show's tone since their return to XM, noting a perceived increase in freedom to mock people in the past.  This was attributed to the more relaxed atmosphere of their previous studio.  The conversation returned to the intern's candy-induced projectile vomiting, and a fundraiser for the family of a deceased colleague, Steve C, was mentioned, having raised nearly $50,000. Don Imus's birthday was also acknowledged.

The hosts then transitioned to a discussion of the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting.  They expressed frustration with the media's focus on the shooter, James Holmes, rather than the victims, proposing a violent, extrajudicial response to deal with him. The conversation shifted to one host's weekend activities, including a walk along the West Side Highway and a visit from Jimmy Norton and Chip.  A humorous anecdote about the host wearing dress socks with boat shoes, subsequently tweeted by Jimmy Norton, led to a debate about sock preferences.  The hosts then dissected the actions of the couple who survived the shooting, focusing heavily on criticism of the husband/fiancé who left his children in the theater while fleeing.  They analyzed a video interview of the man, highlighting his wife's apparent disgust. The man's hospital proposal was also discussed.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of the shooter and the potential for violence against him in prison.


The show continued with further intense focus on the Aurora shooting and the media's portrayal of James Holmes.  The hosts expressed anger at the New York Post's cover featuring Holmes as the "Joker," arguing it glorified his actions. They contrasted this with the media's avoidance of showing people running onto sports fields.  The discussion extended to the execution time of Timothy McVeigh and the hosts' desire for swift justice for Holmes.  Alex Jones's conspiracy theories surrounding the event were briefly mentioned.  A significant portion focused on speculating about Holmes's treatment in prison, considering the potential for retaliation from guards or inmates.  The challenges of handling such a high-profile case and implementing effective deterrents were also discussed. Gun control was debated, with differing opinions on the effectiveness of stricter laws. One host shared his personal firearm knowledge, countering misconceptions about assault weapons.  The hosts criticized the media's tendency to stereotype shooters based on race.  The segment included a digression about a man abandoning his infant and toddler during the shooting, followed by a mention of Joe Paterno and a song referencing "détente." A listener called in describing a personal experience of being robbed at gunpoint.  The segment ended with a discussion of the NRA's stance on gun control and the Second Amendment, followed by a song about a hermaphrodite.

A substantial portion of the broadcast centered on the reaction to Jamie Rourke, who fled the movie theater, leaving his family behind. The hosts and callers used highly offensive language to describe his actions, analyzing his behavior and the circumstances surrounding his girlfriend's injury.  They speculated on the theater's layout and discussed online commentary harshly criticizing Rourke.  A caller, Dan, shared a personal anecdote paralleling Rourke's situation.  Alex Jones then appeared as a guest, offering his theory that the shooting was a staged event connected to a United Nations treaty, involving a manipulated "patsy."  The hosts and Jones discussed this theory, referencing past alleged staged events like the JFK assassination and mentioning mind control drugs like scopolamine. The segment concluded with a discussion of the NCAA's decision to vacate Penn State's football wins due to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, detailing the sanctions and their implications.

The final segment heavily focused on the Penn State sanctions following the Jerry Sandusky scandal, including the $60 million fine, scholarship losses, four-year bowl ban, and the option for players to transfer.  The hosts speculated on the program's future, predicting a significant player exodus and a long recovery period, estimating six to seven years.  The demolition of the Joe Paterno statue was also discussed, along with audio clips of intense reactions from Penn State supporters. The NCAA's actions were analyzed, and characterized as potentially being an “inside job” or “black ops” operation. Highly offensive language was used frequently throughout this discussion of the sexual abuse.  The hosts then returned to discussing the couple from the movie theater shooting, playing audio clips and expressing extreme contempt for the boyfriend's actions using highly offensive language.  Discussions about gun control, the death penalty, and societal hypocrisy followed, again with frequent use of highly offensive language. A caller from Boston commented on the Penn State situation. The broadcast ended with a mention of further discussion on another topic planned for after the show concluded.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah. Good morning.  Hi.  Just watching some old videos.  When times were good, they're still good, but...  Talking about all the bits we used to do.  Over at the other building, the XM building, as opposed to the Sirius building.  When we, I think we can all admit, we're happier. 
[00:00:30]  It was just nicer.  It was just a nice place to be.  We had our own space, our own studio.  A lot of space.  Fans coming by every day.  Yeah.  That kept us motivated, brought an energy with them.  We could feed off their energy and do bits with them.  And then we were low enough to the sidewalk where we could go outside and do all sorts of events.  Yeah.  Well, look at that sidewalk fishing in New York City.  Basically, we had a whole office full of sex toys and porno and... 
[00:01:00]  Swag.  All sorts of porno-type swag.  Yes.  And then we would just drop it on the sidewalk.  And then we would broadcast and film people as they're walking by to see who was brave enough to get a little free gift.  Ah, classic.  Just dropping dildos and what's not on the sidewalk.  Leaving them there for whoever wanted to come by.  And we would just howl when someone finally would, you know, make the move and pick it up.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  And then we would drop more stuff on the sidewalk.  Sidewalk fishing.  Sidewalk fishing.  And then box of cocks.  Box of cocks is one of the best bits we've ever done.  Oh, it was the funniest fuck.  We took a box and then just put the hardcore gay porno images inside the box all over.  A lot of hard penises.  Yeah.  Lined the inside of the box with them.  It was a montage.  Not a middle.  A decoupage.  A decoupage.  And then in the middle, we just had a giant dildo.  Big cock dildo.  Yeah.  Oh, there's the box.  In the box.  There it is. 
[00:02:00]  And then on the outside of the box was written, free puppies.  And we just left it on the sidewalk for people to pass by and go, why are they?  Oh, that's terrible.  A box of free puppies in the middle of a sidewalk in New York City.  And they would open the box up to see the free puppies and if they were okay and be met  with a gaze of a lot of hard, rigid, turgid cock.  Now, if we try this bit today, because I'm looking at the date, 2007, five years ago.  Five years.  The NYPD would have blocks shut down if they saw a box that said free puppies on it. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  They would shut down this city.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Mike.  Oh, boy.  Oh, man.  I was going to do police radio sound.  Batteries.  Police radio voice.  We need batteries.  How do we get batteries done?  Do we have to ask E-Rock to ask the interns?  Oh, well.  Yes.  Fax E-Rock and see if you can send an email to the intern.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  We're not allowed to do anything with interns.  I told these guys a tradition that has been around for probably 50 years where you hire  interns and you beat the shit out of them.  And sometimes you would actually beat the shit out of them for good radio.  This place shut down that activity.  We're allowed when they come in to go, hey.  Yeah, we're not allowed to do anything with interns anymore.  We can still do that.  Be nice.  We can say good morning.  How are you?  We can have a good time with them.  I needed a little something from an intern.  I just did it myself because I'm like, I don't even know what that would mean if I asked 
[00:03:30]  the guy.  What's the protocol?  Yeah.  That was smart on their part.  Be nice.  Be nice.  A 50-year tradition has been shut down.  You're not allowed to do anything with interns.  There's no reason for them to be here.  No, really.  I mean, good luck to them and all.  I hope they learn a thing or two.  Think about it.  But there's no reason to have them anymore.  Yeah.  We could get our own shit.  Who cares?  But the box of cocks, there it is.  People are looking into them.  They're horrified.  Who are these insensitive people who just walk right by a box of free puppies?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  It's terrible.  Maybe they knew there were cocks in it.  You think they've seen this before?  Yes.  They've seen the box of cocks bit.  Yeah.  You'd be fooled again.  No.  Well.  Fool me once.  You certainly can't do that anymore.  Who's that?  Who's this?  Who's this guy?  That's Uncle Kevby.  I don't know who it is.  Has he been around for a while?  Yeah.  Don't talk to him.  He's the dumb one.  Get us.  Is he dumb?  He's dumb.  Oh, he doesn't know where it is.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, Travis doesn't know.  Travis.  Travis. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, no.  How many batteries does that take?  That's crazy.  That is a lot of batteries.  Eight batteries.  Saving them?  Eight double A's.  Yeah, I know.  Once you touch your tongue to each one, you can reuse it.  Are you a battery saver?  Your anal opening.  You're a battery saver.  Yeah.  For what reason?  Because I'm not a millionaire.  So what do you do with the batteries?  These aren't luxury items.  These aren't fucking fine antiques.  They're dead batteries.  What, are you going to build a fucking furniture out of them? 
[00:05:00]  And I love how people just throw it back in our face.  When I had no money, I didn't save batteries.  No, you know what I'm saying?  People don't save batteries ever.  I don't necessarily save batteries, but, like, I'll always rearrange them first before...  Oh, what is that going to go?  You know, that might work for, like, a minute.  Yeah, maybe I just need a minute.  Do you recharge your batteries?  Growing up, we used to recharge our batteries.  I do remember that, but...  We didn't have battery rechargers when I was a child. 
[00:05:30]  We had those Rayovac batteries that were actually wrapped in cardboard.  Remember the batteries that used to leak all the time?  They'd get, like, wet and ruin your toy.  They were literally wrapped in cardboard.  Oh, I sort of remember that.  It was, like, a swirly, cardboardy thing with the label on it and everything.  But if it would go bad, it would get, like, moist and crystal-y and stuff.  But, yeah, then they started lining them in, like, fucking metal.  When was the last time you used the word corrosion? 
[00:06:00]  Corrosion.  Our batteries are corroding.  It's the only time you use it.  Unless, as a kid, that was a rank-out.  A rank-out.  You're like, oh, she's corroded.  Oh, yeah.  She's corroded.  You're corroded.  That's hilarious.  Why would you say someone's corroded?  Because we're all assholes.  Ew, don't fucking touch her.  She's corroded.  We're all assholes.  That meant AIDS.  That was kid AIDS.  They were corroded.  Corroded.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Intern Craig loves candy.  I don't even know what this one is.  We made Craig, uh...  It was, like, the day after Halloween.  Right.  And Craig said he loved candy.  Ah.  So he had to spend the entire show sitting on the couch eating trick-or-treat candy.  Oh, yeah.  I don't mean, like, pounds and pounds and pounds.  You think we're allowed to do that nowadays?  We can't even have an intern eat candy?  I don't think you could have a staff member eat that much candy.  No, no.  No, because one woman died in a contest drinking water.  Right.  So nobody on the radio can drink water ever. 
[00:07:00]  Yep.  That's how it goes.  Look how big that bin of candy is.  That is how things happen, though.  One thing happens, we've got to shut it down for everybody.  That's, uh, in the news right now, as a matter of fact.  Dailymotion?  That's where we ended up putting a lot of our videos, because they would have been taken  down from YouTube.  Oh, right.  Oh, that's the main...  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, like, if you go to Dailymotion.com, you'll find a lot of Opie and Anthony videos  that you won't find.  Dailymotion.  And some logos.  I got a few on Dailymotion, because they don't...  They're cooler than YouTube.  Yeah.  YouTube gets just so panicky all the time over dumb stuff. 
[00:07:30]  There's Craig, just eating candy.  Yeah, whatever.  So we're just...  I don't even...  Why...  Oh, because of the Steve C. tribute, Sam noticed that the show sounded different when we first  got back to XM.  Yeah.  It wasn't better or worse.  It just sounded different, is what you're saying.  Yeah, it sounded very different when you got back to XM.  And I said you were also...  I felt like, in the early days, like, of making fun of Steve's car and, you know, naming  me and Martini Steve and stuff. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  There was a more...  It sounded a little more free to make fun of people.  You guys didn't seem to be worried too much about, you know...  Well, when you're beaten down like we have been in this place for a few years, yeah.  You just stopped doing those things.  We kept it fun, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a big studio with a studio audience, and we were on our own over there.  It was good.  It was nice.  It was real good.  Maybe we were also happy to be back.  It was early on.  Mm-hmm.  Well, they said, trust us.  You know, this is the place to be over here in this building. 
[00:08:30]  Isn't this great?  That's the place to be.  Even though we worked our whole careers to have our own setup, designed our own studio,  bleachers, everything.  Oh, it was fantastic.  That studio was great, man.  But they're like, trust us.  This is where you want to be.  No, you want to be here in a cubicle that looks like every other studio and watch management  walk around the hallways.  I don't see them walking around these days.  Well, at the end of the show.  Oh, at the end of the show, yeah.  Yeah, they love the end of the show meeting.  Like, oh, we just happen to be walking down here. 
[00:09:00]  Why is Craig puking?  He's projectile vomiting peanut butter cups.  We're not allowed to do that anymore.  Oh, my God, no.  I don't think so.  No, that stinks.  Never.  We might not have been allowed to do that then.  We knew our own line back then.  There was always the company line and then our line.  Yeah.  And our company line, our line moved a little further than the company line.  But everyone was cool with it.  We all kind of had an understanding.  Now they come running down the hall if we're scolding an intern.  Oh, is he vomiting? 
[00:09:30]  A lot.  The Steve C special was great, by the way.  I know.  I heard.  People loved it.  It was really good.  I wanted to listen.  I just couldn't listen.  People loved it.  But the feedback was amazing.  Oh, God, is he puking.  It's cranky, bro.  $50,000 for Steve C's family, E-Rock.  Just about.  It's pretty righteous.  Yeah, we're just under $50,000.  That's great.  Nice.  You send me the link.  I'll retweet it.  Sure.  Thank you for everyone who donated.  That's wonderful.  Something positive.  All right.  Don Imus is 72 today. 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  Yeah, I'm 72 years old today.  72 years old.  Oh, my God.  72.  Wow.  All right.  How was everyone's weekend?  Oh, wonderful.  What a nice weekend.  Nice weather.  You know, I told you before the show, I turned off the Colorado shooting coverage.  Oh.  And I realized that there was a nice, bright, sunny world out there.  Yeah.  Where the birds were chirping and the waves were crashing. 
[00:10:30]  Beautiful, right?  It was just so nice.  Yeah.  I think we kill ourselves sitting in front of the TV and just, you know, trying to consume  as much sadness as possible when these tragedies hit.  Yeah, with the 24-hour news and everything, you can't get away from it.  And then you already have a level of sadness, but the media's like, no, I think we could get  it even worse.  I think we could push this sadness thing up a little bit.  Yeah.  Now we're going to just talk about each individual victim.  Yeah.  This is really going to hurt.  This is really going to hurt your heartstrings.  I understand what happened. 
[00:11:00]  It was a horrendous tragedy.  Yeah.  Horrendous.  I know all the basic facts of it, but I chose not to do what I usually do and just sit and  watch every single minute of it.  I would turn on the news and if they weren't talking about something new, I knew there  was nothing new, even though I just turned it on because they would be pounding the shit  out of that.  Right.  But they were just reiterating everything people knew.  But they trick you and they go, well, coming up, we got new.  I know that trick.  And then you sit there and you go, you don't got new. 
[00:11:30]  You told me you got new, but it's the same, same new.  So I turned that off.  Turn something else on.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Obviously horrendous.  Horrible.  Yeah.  No one even tried it.  And everyone's debating how do we solve this.  You know how you solve this?  Yeah.  You realize that we're animals and you take this fucking asshole back out back and you  shoot him in the head.  Oh, that would be great.  And guess what?  The next asshole coward might think twice about this instead of throwing him through our judicial. 
[00:12:00]  But it's America.  Fuck all that right now.  And he knows that he's going to get in the news.  Pull him out of that jail cell.  Take him out back and shoot him and don't even do anything with his body.  Just let it sit there.  Let him rot.  For real.  For real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did this just so he'd get this type of recognition and attention.  And they're giving him just what he wants.  And they give it to him.  Of course.  Not covering the story.  Not talking about the victims.  But I mean, on the cover of the post, his fucking red hair, referring to him as the 
[00:12:30]  Joker.  It's like they literally are giving him exactly what he was hoping for.  I'm not talking about don't cover it.  They got to cover it.  But the way they're doing it, focusing on him.  Don't call him Joker.  Mad man.  Joker's mad house yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly what he wants.  Right.  The press is doing.  Bravo.  Bravo to everybody who gave him what he wanted.  I say you just shoot him in the back of the fucking head.  Shoot him in the front of the head.  Let him see it coming. 
[00:13:00]  You're on the side.  In the face.  Whatever.  I don't give a fuck.  Just shoot him.  Shoot him in the face.  Get him off this earth.  Yeah.  Immediately.  I went for a nice walk yesterday.  I walked for an hour down the West Side Highway.  I thought of you.  That's what I do.  Did you find a short pier?  See?  What were you looking for that you were walking or was it really peace of mind?  I just woke up and I'm like, I just wanted to exercise, but I'm like, I wanted to just  go for a walk.  It's nice down there.  Yeah, it was great.  So I walked for an hour.  You don't feel like you're in New York City when you're walking down there.  No, and you walk longer than I would.  I walked longer than I would have done other exercises for. 
[00:13:30]  How far down did you get?  I did like 60 blocks total.  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good one.  You should get a bike.  Yeah, I thought of that too.  It's made for a bike just going up and down the West Side like that.  It's really nice.  Oh, and then Jimmy Norton came over to my house on Saturday to watch the UFC fight.  Yes, and Chip also came over, which is very odd when it's just me and Chip sitting on the 
[00:14:00]  couch.  Yeah, right.  It's very odd that Chip comes over and starts talking.  I look around the room and go, there's no one else here.  Sometimes he needs us to do something too.  Sometimes with me, I just need to go somewhere and get away from Chip so you got him for a  while.  It's all fun and games, but then when you realize that Jim Norton's not in the room  anymore, that's when it gets really creepy.  And you got to tell Chip, no, you wouldn't do that.  You're lying.  You're like, yeah, I would kick him.  I would do the crane and then kick him in the face.  It's like, no, you wouldn't do that, Chip. 
[00:14:30]  And I'm talking to Chip.  Of course.  It was fun though.  There's no audience there.  There's no other people.  Sometimes you just have to go with it and just go like, really?  Yeah.  And you go, yeah.  Yeah.  And then, what an embarrassment.  I was going to do a compound show on Saturday, but then I decide, Jimmy texts, and I'm like,  yeah, Jimmy's come over.  We'll watch the UFC fight and everything.  So I didn't do it.  But before, I don't have to wear shoes because it's the compound show. 
[00:15:00]  I'm sitting down.  So I just kind of put some socks on, and then I slid on these horrible, like, things.  Oh, yuck.  Slipperish, deck-shoe-ish, beachy-looking shoe things.  I saw the picture.  And I just slipped them on over dress socks.  And I was walking around in those, and then Jimmy came over, and I didn't even think about it.  I am sitting watching UFC.  Why were you wearing dress socks?  Well, I had them on.  You just wore dress socks? 
[00:15:30]  Earlier, yeah, but then I kicked my sneakers off, and then I put these things on.  I kind of like the feel of a good dress sock.  You were wearing dress socks and sneakers?  I don't know why.  I like the feel.  See, look.  I don't know why you like dress socks.  Because he likes going boating.  I like the feel of a good dress sock.  What about a height that?  They fall down.  No, no, they don't fall down.  On my calves, they do.  A good dress sock stays up, and the material's very thin and nice.  I need a nice, athletic, white, cotton sock. 
[00:16:00]  It's too bulky, and they got that seam thing, and it's like, yeah, no, I need a good dress  sock.  Dress socks get me a sweating, and it activates the athlete's foot.  No, the big fucking athletic sock is that.  They don't call it dress sock foot.  It's athletic socks.  It's athlete's foot.  No, athletic socks soak up the moisture that will cause the athlete's foot.  Oh, that's good.  You hold it against your fucking foot.  But I think they call them dress socks, because generally you wear them with dress shoes and  dress pants.  No, they're very comfortable.  I enjoy them much more than the big, bulky, white sock. 
[00:16:30]  I hate them.  You do.  Yes.  I have two pairs of dress socks.  That's it.  They have yellow toes?  I think so.  Wow.  And I only wear them maybe not even once a year at this point.  Well, I was wearing them, and I was wearing these other horrible, shoe-y thing, and I  kick my feet up on the ottoman to watch a UFC, and I'm just sitting there, and out of  nowhere, I just hear this, and I look over, and Jimmy is now fidgeting with his phone and 
[00:17:00]  smiling, and I knew exactly what had happened there.  I got you.  He took a picture and tweeted it, and it's terrible.  Terrible.  That happens.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, yeah, he got me on that one.  I don't understand how you don't enjoy a thinner sock.  No.  Everything's stuffed in a shoe.  It's just, ugh.  A thinner sock is nice, but I can't wear these, these.  Like, I'm wearing dark socks. 
[00:17:30]  No, I was wearing them yesterday, and they fall down.  Dark socks fall down.  Not the cheap, black dress socks that everybody just has in their drawer to wear with,  Why are you defending this?  To wear, because I.  You realize we're right.  No, you're not.  You're panicking.  You're panicking.  They get sweaty when I'm in a dress sock.  No, you've got to have the right dress sock.  No, they're not.  There's something uncomfortable about a dress sock, unless you're going to a wedding.  No, see, it's not a dress, see, like that sock right there that I'm wearing.  That's a good sock.  Is that cotton?  It's, uh.  It's got to be cotton.  It's got.  Oh, my God.  What are you, in an 80s band? 
[00:18:00]  Let me see.  It's an 80s band.  Ah, that's a horrible picture.  But it's, no, there's a texture to it on the inside.  It's very comfortable.  It's not just that swath of thin black material dress sock.  I'm not talking that.  Don't they make your, like, they make my calves itch if they're too tight?  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  They hug your calf.  I mean, the good ones that you're talking about that don't fall down.  And they hug your calf too tightly.  And I don't like a strangled calf.  I enjoy a comfortable, I like a nice fucking athletic tube sock. 
[00:18:30]  Crisp new pair of white Hanes socks.  I won't totally go against the nice new white sock.  Right.  But on a daily basis, I've got to go with a good dress sock.  You are a fancy man.  I try.  Well, what about the shoes, though?  Could we all agree you should throw those away?  There's a problem.  Those are boating shoes.  Yes.  Why do you have boat shoes on?  I had those.  Yeah, exactly.  Why?  You are a hipster.  I'm a hipster.  Hipsters wear boat shoes. 
[00:19:00]  Boat shoes with dress socks.  I'm ironic.  It is.  It's irony.  No, I had those for quite a while.  And they were just sitting around.  And I slid them on.  Lest I did not have to go upstairs to put on my sneaks.  Because I was just going to do a compound show.  So why put on socks?  So you say, I mean, shoes.  You say slip into something a little more comfortable.  Well, when you come down in boat shoes and dress socks.  They were downstairs.  That's why I put them on.  Were you wearing a smoking jacket with a pipe? 
[00:19:30]  I was thinking about it.  Yeah.  But I decided not to.  Yeah, those shoes look so uncomfortable.  Boating shoes, dress socks.  And, by the way, tactical pants.  Well, of course.  Of course.  All right.  I dress like an idiot.  You don't wear your tactical socks, though.  No, I didn't have my 5'11 tactical socks.  Those seem to be a bit tight.  Yeah.  They're athletic in nature.  But they're a bit too snuggy for my taste.  Yeah.  I've tried.  They are a little snuggy.  They're not bad. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  They are snuggy.  If you want a snug sock.  If you want to feel like your foot is being hugged all day.  That's true.  Then those are the socks for you.  I don't like any sock with a design on it.  Unless it's a couple stripes or something.  It's got to be just white, right?  Well, everyone knows you're fucking real toast fuddy-duddy with everything.  Do you do a little color on your toes, though?  I'll put a little gray on the toes, sure.  I go gold.  Gray, maybe some red stitching.  A little gold, maybe a little gray just on the toes.  That's it.  Everything else white.  What about the heel?  The heel's got a little gray, too.  Gray on the heel.  That's all right, too.  But no logos. 
[00:20:30]  I hate logos.  I don't like a logo sock.  I don't like logos on anything.  Remember the old white socks that had the red and blue stripe around the top?  Those are your basic, generic gym socks.  I like when the girls wear the socks all the way up, though.  I'm a big fan of that.  Yeah.  What is it now?  Halfway up their thighs?  Yeah.  Socks all the way up.  Holy fuck, are those socks sexy on the right broad.  Yeah.  Anyway, you didn't watch the British Open, huh?  No, not a second of it.  Even in your boat shoes and your dress socks? 
[00:21:00]  Boat shoes, dress socks, tack pants.  He's watching the America's Cup race.  Adam Scott had quite the collapse, though, sir.  And Ernie L is an old-timer there, 42 years old, wins the British Open out of nowhere.  He made up, I think, seven strokes on the final day.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  That is crazy.  I did hear about it, but I didn't watch any.  There was a little chokage.  There always seems to be chokage at the end of these tournaments. 
[00:21:30]  Somebody fucks up.  Well, Adam Scott doesn't deserve to win because he uses the giant putter.  Oh, he's got one of those big putters?  He's one of those giant putter guys.  I hate those giant putters.  They look silly.  You don't deserve to win anything if you putt that way.  That's his first mistake.  That's stupid.  He's one of, I think, maybe two to three guys at this point that use the giant putter.  It looks stupid. 
[00:22:00]  Is that the one you hold, like?  Way up.  Way up.  It's under his chin.  It's under your chin.  Pretty much under his chin.  Yeah, it looks so stupid.  No, but you've got to use your middle finger and your index finger like this on the bottom.  Oh, is that how he does it?  Oh, yeah.  Swings it like a pendulum.  He doesn't really hold the bottom part of the putter.  Yes.  He just kind of directs it with those two fingers.  It's stupid.  Sounds stupid.  But it was a good tournament for the golf fans out there, whatever.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know what else to say about that.  It's golf.  I love how much Travis hates this couple.  I think the couple who got engaged after the massacre now,  Well, they have two kids.  Yeah, but I kind of hate them, too.  You do hate them.  I'm glad they survived, but yeah, I hate the guy.  I hate him.  Yeah, Travis was talking about how much he despises this guy.  Here comes Trav.  And it's questionable as to what he did during the shooting. 
[00:23:00]  Was he more interested in self-preservation or heroics?  Or what was going on there?  He stands his way out of it.  I think what goes on is your brain completely shuts down when mayhem is all around you.  Well, that's when people are separated into those categories of hero  and being able to look at a situation, assess and react, and sheer panic. 
[00:23:30]  The fight or flight comes into play, and apparently this guy loves that flight part of the whole thing.  Because isn't your parental instinct supposed to come in?  Right.  And you're protecting your young.  Of course.  Because he was at the movies.  It wasn't like they were separated buying popcorn and he was inside.  They were sitting together in the back of the theater, him with his fiancée or his chick  and his four-month-old and their four-year-old.  Yeah.  First of all, I just hate them for that.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  For just bringing two kids that age.  But hold on.  You've never brought your kid to anything?  Sure, I have.  But I've seen kids at all sorts of shit, and as long as they're not acting up,  I don't give a fuck.  Maybe they knew that the kid would sleep through the whole fucking thing.  I wouldn't take that chance as somebody who hates other parents that do that.  Hold on.  I've brought my kid to...  Because I saw this all over Facebook and I laughed at these idiots because they have no clue. 
[00:24:30]  I've brought my very young son to movies, restaurants, and whatnot.  Sure.  And if he does act up, guess what?  I'm out of there.  Period.  I don't think they would have been out of there.  I've never had that.  Is there a midnight screening?  We've been lucky.  He didn't act up, so we're lucky.  Would you have brought your four-month-old, though, to the Dark Knight Rises?  Probably.  At midnight?  At midnight?  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Because they sleep 18 hours a day, so probably.  I would have had him in a thing in front, and he would have probably slept through the whole movie. 
[00:25:00]  But I would have picked a seat close to the aisle or whatever, and if he acted up, I'm out of there.  Period.  You would hear maybe one quick cry, and you would hear the door closing.  I'd be out of there.  You're in a small minority.  Most people are not that giving.  Most people, when their kid cries, are...  Well, they're assholes.  Some of them are.  Yeah, that's the difference.  But this is a midnight movie.  This isn't like a kid's movie.  This is a fucking adult movie.  Yeah, I don't know.  It just, like, this isn't like you're taking your kid to, like, a Saturday matinee. 
[00:25:30]  Like, this just seems so selfish that, like, oh, they had to go to the midnight screenings.  Well, their thought is they have no family, and they don't make a lot of money.  Movie tickets cost the same every day, every show.  That's what they're saying.  No, I'm just...  I still hate them.  Yeah.  Fucking hate them.  All I'm doing is giving you the other side.  You have a...  Of course you should.  Oh, I hear you.  That's how you feel.  I don't care.  There's plenty of stuff with my daughter because I know how she's going to act.  Right.  And maybe they decided...  Especially when they're first born, all they do is sleep.  And they sleep through everything at first. 
[00:26:00]  But I'm not entirely sure that a four-year-old should be watching that movie.  Well, the four-year-old, that's a whole different argument.  I mean, my kid's three, and I certainly wouldn't let her watch The Dark Knight Rises.  Yeah, I think that's where I'm in agreement with you guys.  A four-year-old is a completely different animal.  They're aware of everything at four.  They're just being selfish.  I mean, people sometimes want to do what they want to do.  And they, you know, whatever.  Do you think the guy was a little more selfish than the girl?  Oh, my...  That's why.  That's all...  Well, the girl is a hero, right?  Well, she did what her mother should do. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  She protected her kids.  Someone's instincts kicked in.  The others didn't.  The guy who fucking lost wherever his infant was and then just decided to leave the theater  and not go back in.  And I'm not playing phony, brave.  Believe me, I'm a coward.  But I also don't have children.  Like, you're supposed to have parental instincts and nature.  Like, there's nothing more...  Of course the mother wouldn't leave.  That's why they get them in custody cases, by the way.  If anybody's wondering why women win all custody, it's for this reason. 
[00:27:00]  It's because their instincts to protect their young.  There's no way the mother would leave the kids.  Oh, what's going on there with that couple?  Okay.  White, black.  Is that what it is?  Maybe a little Hispanic.  There's something a little brownish.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, she's a black guy.  She's a Colorado theater shooting.  She looks like she plucks her eyebrows out and then draws them in with a pencil.  That could be a Hispanic.  Engaged hours after a surviving tragedy.  That's a different...  That's them?  No, that doesn't look like them.  That doesn't look like them.  Oh, okay.  Who is that?  That's a different couple, man. 
[00:27:30]  That's definitely a different couple.  Than the one you're talking about right now.  The couple I'm thinking about is a white couple.  Yeah.  Ha ha, Sam.  What did you do?  Sam doesn't see color.  Hold on, what's that name?  You just saw a couple.  They just saw a couple.  That's very noble.  How about LaGretta?  That's her name.  Oh, wow.  That's them?  LaGretta.  Then somebody else showed the wrong people.  No, it's not them.  Yeah, I saw a different picture.  That's Patricia LaGretta.  But they're not the ones with the four-month and the four-year-old.  The other two were all over the place.  LaGretta and her daughter... 
[00:28:00]  The other two are both Hispanic.  The couple's son, Ethan.  That might be them.  Maybe you're looking at a different picture.  Maybe they put a wrong picture in the paper for that couple.  It says...  What's his name?  LaGretta and 19-year-old Jarrell Brooks.  The story you guys are saying about...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  No, Roars.  Thank you.  Yeah, this guy saved her.  Ah!  Oh, that guy...  That's the guy that saved her.  Yeah.  The black dude saved her.  After her fiancé.  After her fiancé.  No.  After the fiancé tooled out of there. 
[00:28:30]  No, there's no reason there should be a picture of her.  So they think those two are the couple.  Well, you know what?  The media fucked it up.  It kind of shows right there that that definitely makes me think that they're getting engaged.  Yeah.  You don't have a headline that says Colorado Theater shooting victim engaged, then a man  and a woman...  I thought that.  Yeah.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Wait, what are you saying?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm saying that...  These two are not getting engaged.  No.  But it makes it look like that.  But these two were interviewed for whatever reason, and then I think the media heard,  oh, engaged, and went with this picture, not knowing the real guy. 
[00:29:00]  He saved her, and GMA reunited the two of them.  He saved her and her daughter while that fucking cocksucker boyfriend left his kid there.  Yeah, but you know what?  To his credit, he kept calling her cell phone.  Oh, that's cool.  Hey, there you go.  He lost track of his infant son.  Wow.  That does not sound like a man who would have walked outside if the kid was crying.  What a piece of shit.  And that's why I totally get what you're saying, Ope.  I've taken my daughter to stuff because I know how she's going to act, but this guy just 
[00:29:30]  gives me the sense that he wouldn't have left like you or I would have.  Unless he's in danger.  Did he jump off something?  I heard he put the kid down and jumped thinking that that was the best chance the kid had.  I have no idea.  What?  I haven't read that.  I would have went back in the theater.  I wouldn't have left the theater.  You don't leave your fucking...  But you don't even know.  No, I mean, you got a guy, a fucking maniac.  Who knows what is going on?  Is it your instinct to fall on your baby?  Your instinct is to protect your kid, I would gather.  Even if I did leave, yeah, I would have gone back in.  Once you realize that, oh, okay, they're not out here, let me go back in. 
[00:30:00]  I said a few months ago, when you become a father, you realize that you would actually  absolutely give up your life for your kid.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, there were boyfriends who took bullets for their girlfriends here, and this guy's  running away from his kids.  I wouldn't fault the guy who left his girlfriend.  Like, I could see myself doing that.  All I'm saying is, I think you're breaking it down to the basics.  I would like to know more details about what was going on there.  He hightailed it out of there.  He hightailed it out of there.  You think that's all it was?  He hightailed it the fuck out, man.  You saw a smoke, and he ran out of that kitchen. 
[00:30:30]  Fire!  That's why he said marry me.  He ran out of there like a cartoon character.  Oh, plowing over children, women, and walkers.  That's why he wants to marry her.  He feels guilty.  Yes.  He feels guilty about the cowardly, and again, I'm not phony brave, but I don't have fucking  infant children to look after.  Well, get the interview, because he goes through moment by moment what he was doing.  I think it was on Anderson Cooper, if you could find it.  Then I got some Jiu-Jitsu fruits.  He's like the fucking guy in the Saving Private Ryan. 
[00:31:00]  I just stood on the stairs while his friends were being stabbed upstairs.  Because his account of what happened was chilling, to be honest with you.  Yeah, look.  Chilling.  His name is...  I've never been in that exact situation, but...  But I could see leaving a woman, another adult.  I could see doing that.  I don't know.  But an infant?  You have a fucking four-month-old infant, and you leave it in the theater?  He throws the kid at the fucking gunman.  That's not the one.  Trying to distract him.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's not the one.  That's not the one.  Anybody get a fan vibe from the guy when you first see him? 
[00:31:30]  Did you?  Yeah, yeah.  The gunman?  Oh, the gunman.  You get like...  The second you look real quick, you're like...  The first thing I thought was, oh, God, he kind of looks like fan.  Wow, they don't have the interview.  It was chilling.  It really was chilling.  Maybe it wasn't Anderson Cooper.  Sam, his name is...  Maybe it was Piers.  It might have been that dope.  Jamie Wors.  R-O...  I think it was Piers.  HRS.  H-R-S.  Interview.  Piers.  I think it was actually Piers Morgan.  I think he got that one. 
[00:32:00]  Did Piers ask him, why did you leave your son in the...  It is...  It's about four to five minutes.  I'm sure he tried to make it sound like he was...  I don't know.  How do you run away and leave them there?  Here it is.  This is it right here.  All right.  This is the couple we're talking about.  I find myself just standing and just my son's on the floor and I'm looking around and like  I see the balcony because the shots had stopped for a second and I look over to see if I can 
[00:32:30]  jump over because I'm on top of the balcony and I'm contemplating in my head like can I  jump and can I jump with Ethan without him breaking his neck or me landing on him or...  And like as I turn to like find Ethan in the dark of the theater with the gas, like I'm  just so disoriented and I lose him.  I don't lose him and then he's open fire again and I'm like, you gotta get Ethan.  You gotta get Ethan.  So I'm trying to... 
[00:33:00]  Can you pause that real quick?  Look at her face.  Oh man.  Look at the fucking face on that.  Yes.  Look at her.  There's not an ounce of a loving look.  No.  She is pissed, right?  She fucking knows.  She's looking down.  There's no emotion on her face.  Like he's earned.  He left her in the theater to be shot.  He ditched her.  And the kid.  He left the fucking baby to be shot.  Oh man.  He probably will never get over this.  Do you think that'll come up in arguments later on in life?  Oh yeah.  I would bring it up. 
[00:33:30]  I don't even know him.  I'm gonna bring it up with whoever I'm dating.  He'll never be allowed to go anywhere with that kid again.  Oh man.  Dude, that's...  Listen to this.  She was right there with him.  Why would you need to jump instead of just laying over your fucking son?  Oh man.  Yeah, just get on the ground.  You picture your father fucking running out of a room that there's a shooting in and leaving  you there?  Oh man.  What a fucking cock.  This guy sucks.  Wow.  Yeah, look.  You're right. 
[00:34:00]  Her face.  She is fucking...  Literally, she'd be happier if he was describing how he got blown in the lobby.  I'm like, you gotta get Ethan.  You gotta get Ethan.  So I'm trying to...  I'm like, you gotta run back.  You gotta run and find him and get him.  And then once I was saying, just jump.  If you run back, you're dead.  That's it.  You're done.  You're done.  This is it.  Just jump.  Just pray that he won't kill your four-month-year-old. 
[00:34:30]  Just pray that you don't find him.  So I jump and I run and I land and I'm running.  I said, I'm running.  I'm looking behind me to see if people are running behind me.  And I'm looking for her and I'm looking for her and I don't see him.  And one hat's telling me, just go back in.  Go back.  Like, you can't leave him in there.  And it's like, well, if you go back, you're dead too.  And what if our kids live and they're orphans? 
[00:35:00]  You're just thinking, like, please let him get out alive.  And then I'm thinking, I don't want to live.  If they all die, I don't want to live.  You want to live bad enough to leave him there, motherfucker.  And her face has not changed.  No.  She's still looking down.  She's stone-faced.  She's stone-faced, looking down, won't even look at him.  She's disgusted with him.  He fucking, he's, watch how, this is how you know he's full of shit.  When he's going, I was looking around and then all of a sudden he's like, I wanted to get back in. 
[00:35:30]  No, no, no.  Describe the moment where you know where your baby is.  There's four seats.  Yeah.  And describe how your instinct is to jump off the balcony and not protect, Ethan, Ethan, Nathan.  How did you get out of the theater?  Why are you not, you couldn't see him on the dark theater floor?  I understand being disoriented.  And he was in the balcony?  Yeah.  And the gunman was below?  Yeah.  He stayed in the balcony.  I'll say, people are already saying he's never, ever going to get the number one dad mug for Father's Day. 
[00:36:00]  Thank you, fish, man.  Yeah, he's never going to get that.  This guy fucking stinks.  I think in that scenario, God forbid, if I was there, I would have had to stay with my kid in the balcony and then figure out a move.  Yeah.  He went for his move way too early.  Oh.  Way too fucking early.  He looked around, said, I don't see my son.  All right, I'm jumping.  Just get on top of it and fucking lay there.  But he might just be stupid.  I think that has a lot to do with it.  He might just be stupid. 
[00:36:30]  Even Uncle Paul lays on top of the kid, even when there's no gunfire.  In a safe movie theater, he lays down on top of the kids.  I think you're really safe in the balcony.  Even if you stay in the right theater.  I think so.  Your parental instinct should take over and protect your fucking infant kids.  Yeah, because the gunman would have to come up and around, up into the balcony.  Then him and Ethan could go for the jump if he has no choice.  He was in a safe position compared to everybody else in that theater that night.  She's disgusted because another man helped her. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, they're never going to get over this.  No.  Yeah.  Why would she marry this guy?  Of course she said yes at the end because he asked, you know.  The only thing we will never know is the absolute panic that you feel in that situation.  Oh, yeah.  And what that does to an individual is all I'm saying.  Well, it's supposed to come to the table.  We all would like to think we'd be a hero and take a bullet for our girlfriend or our  wife or, you know.  Not them, I wouldn't know.  Not one.  Or, you know, jump on your kid.  We all would absolutely say that.  But the only thing we don't know is the level of panic and what that does to the brain. 
[00:37:30]  That's all I'm saying.  Just throw it in there.  Well.  You're supposed to have that.  It's almost instinctual.  Instinctual.  That's an animal fucking thing.  You're right, right.  But my point is this.  He went for his move way too early.  He was in a pretty safe place.  Yeah.  Considering, obviously.  His move should have been to wait it out a little bit longer.  Especially a fucking infant.  Right.  Like, what?  Fucking, even dogs usually don't bite infants.  Even shitty dogs know that infants are something you don't fuck with. 
[00:38:00]  Did he at least shove the infant under his seat before he jumped?  He didn't know what a kid was.  He didn't know what a kid was.  I couldn't find Ethan.  I jumped.  I couldn't find Ethan.  I gotta go back in.  I gotta, but then I'm thinking I could be, he said, then I'm thinking I could be dead too.  And then he's thinking.  Which is very telling because he was like, ah, my family did.  And then he's thinking, I don't want Ethan to be an orphan.  You shut the fuck up.  You did it for the kid.  Little orphan Ethan.  But you left, you left Ethan there so he wouldn't be an orphan?  Yeah.  While she fucking trudged out the two kids? 
[00:38:30]  You don't.  You know how awful this guy's going to be when they fly together?  Oh, he's the worst.  I hope this fuck, she's not going to marry him.  No.  Nah, I don't think so.  She is fucking stone facing him.  Ooh, does she not like this?  Let's hear the rest.  Please, I'm praying and I'm just praying.  Just please let him get out alive.  And I got a phone call from a Colorado number and I answered it.  And thank God it was Patricia just telling me. 
[00:39:00]  And her hero.  Hold on.  Pause there.  It was Patricia and her hero because that's the other picture.  The black guy.  Of course, she was probably calling from the black guy.  From his cell phone.  Oh, man.  Of course she was.  Oh, man.  It was from his cell phone.  And I called it back and there was a rap ringtone and I didn't know what it was.  Of course it was a black guy, too, because they are cool under pressure, man.  Gunfire.  They know how to handle gunfire.  Now, you could say that or you could just say that they'll do anything for a white girl. 
[00:39:30]  But good for that guy helping her out.  You know how fucking disgusted she is?  You know how this guy has a deep-seated humiliation?  Our impotent man, yes.  He fucking left his girl and kids in the fucking theater.  And another 19-year-old helped them out.  And now he's got to sit there with her and explain that.  I'm almost embarrassed for this guy.  Yeah.  And I feel terrible for her.  Because you know this dummy wanted to come to the movie.  He's the one that said we'll go. 
[00:40:00]  Selfish asshole.  Fuck it.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Fuck.  For her to tell me, like, I have Asla.  Do you have Ethan?  And I didn't know what to tell her.  She had him born.  Can you pause again?  I'm sorry.  I can't imagine going to my wife.  I don't have him.  I don't have him.  I jumped and ran.  I jumped and ran.  I don't know where the fuck he is.  She's asking, do you have Ethan?  You're like, hi.  Excuse me.  There was gunfire going on. 
[00:40:30]  I don't know how to tell you this.  But I...  Were you in there?  That was an every man for himself situation.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Here in this interview again, I might be changing my, uh...  You know.  But, I mean, the panic in that theater, though.  I mean, maybe there's different levels of heroics and what you would do in this situation.  But this guy took the complete fucking coward's way.  He left his own infant son.  If it was somebody else's kid, I wouldn't sit here and posture phony brain.  I really wouldn't.  Right.  Because I know I'm a fucking save-your-ass fight-or-flight guy. 
[00:41:00]  But if you have your own infant, and your instinct is not to fucking protect your four-month-old,  then you fucking should not be coming in women.  Right.  And a four-year-old.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  And a four-year-old.  Well, she saved the four-year-old, right?  Oh, yeah.  Did she have the infant or no?  She had it under control.  Well, how about she was a bit selfish running out of there, not grabbing the husband and  the new boy.  Wait a minute.  Didn't she say, do you have Ethan?  No, he said he was worried that that's what she would say.  Oh.  I think what happened was... 
[00:41:30]  But she said, I have both of them.  Don't worry, honey.  I have both of them.  I saved both of them.  While you ran away.  But I think because of the sheer terror and panic and mayhem, they were split up immediately.  She's like, holy fuck, I'm just going to grab this kid and hope my husband grabs  the other one and get us out of here.  Yeah.  Right?  Because they weren't together.  If he had the baby and ran out and she had the other kid, I wouldn't be criticizing him.  Right.  I'd go, what's...  You know?  He just completely dropped the ball here.  But you can compliment him on this.  He did take the time to match his shirt to his hat. 
[00:42:00]  He did.  What a clown.  He's a big Broncos fan.  So.  Yeah.  This guy sucks.  She's livid right there.  Look at her fucking face.  Amazing.  He stood in front of his closet trying to find a blue t-shirt to match his Broncos hat for  longer than he stood trying to figure out how to fit his hair.  There's three months at home.  Oh, boy.  That's pretty funny.  There's a different blue, though.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Oh, God.  I'm ready for my clue set.  Honey, we're going to be on TV. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, this guy is truly fucking terrible.  Does Piers give him any lip about this whole thing?  I think Piers is pretty amazed by his account.  The whole...  Amazed?  How about...  Look at the wife's or the girlfriend's face.  Listen to his story of utter cowardice.  And comment on it.  Well, let's see what happens.  It's almost done.  Yeah.  Thank God she had them both.  Patricia, there is one happy ending to this, and that is what happened in the hospital 
[00:43:00]  later on, that Jamie did something very special.  Tell me about that.  We were in the hospital for about a good 10 minutes.  Wow.  A long time.  And he'd gone to the restroom and came out, and he just looked at me, and he said,  I know this isn't the time or the place.  And he's like, but will you marry me?  And I said yes.  And you just...  Something like this, just... 
[00:43:30]  I was knowing...  She got out of the shitter.  Going through...  Yeah.  She was still washing shit off her hands.  He just took a nervous post-almost murdered shit.  And this idiot thought it was the perfect time.  As the fumes were wafting out.  He's like, that's what I want to wake up to.  Oh, man.  This guy just isn't aware of anything.  No.  He's an idiot.  No.  Women really want to be in a perfect position if you're going to ask him to marry you.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Not coming out of the shitter.  After a mass shooting.  Right.  Wow.  He had two kids, so it's not like...  You know, it's a...  It's not like he...  This is a...  He waited too long as it was.  Right.  And then when he finally did it after having two kids with her, it's after he left the  kids behind in a movie theater that we've been shot up by.  Let our engagement remind you of my cowardice.  Right.  And how I ran out.  The time I shit right after you almost made me get killed.  Oh, this guy stinks. 
[00:44:30]  Because of the shit.  Yeah.  Maybe he should stay off TV.  He's not coming across too well.  No.  I bet that was definitely his idea, though, to accept the interview.  You know she doesn't want to, like, keep telling people this story.  Fucking...  I gotta try to clear myself.  And meanwhile, he just sounds like fucking an idiot.  He sounds hateable.  Yeah.  I like her.  I don't find her hateable at all.  Because you know he's the one that wanted to go to the movie.  Yeah.  Let's go.  There's no way that...  Maybe they can't get a babysitter that late and everything.  No, we'll take the kids. 
[00:45:00]  Just take the kids.  Fuck it.  No, they'll get married.  It's only three hours.  You got them.  Yeah.  It's only three hours at midnight.  Oh, boy.  And the four-year-old loves Batman.  Yeah.  There's only fucking gunfire and murders and...  Don't even worry about it.  Oh, my God.  PG-13.  Parental guidance.  Right.  We are the parents.  We're parenting.  We're parenting.  We're guiding them.  So this guy's got his first court appearance today?  Yeah, yeah.  Any shot of sniper or somebody will get at him? 
[00:45:30]  No.  No.  They always make sure these guys are taken care of.  I guess they said he's going to go for the insanity plea.  Yeah.  He's going to go.  It's going to be a little rough, though.  I mean, he was planning this for about three months.  So it does have that premeditation factor, not just like you went off the deep end.  They got the death penalty in Colorado?  Yes, they do.  Will they do something about it, though?  Well, we won't be alive to see it.  Yeah, most states have the death penalty, but they don't really... 
[00:46:00]  Not most, but a lot of states have the death penalty, and they never use it.  The appeals process, also.  This is a complete and utter joke.  If you have it, fucking use it.  There's the appeals process, which goes on for 20 fucking years.  But that's how they got around it.  They basically don't want the death penalty in any states.  So they slow down the process.  Not Texas, though.  No, no.  Texas will fucking fry your ass.  Texas is good when it comes to that.  This guy's in a woman's, I think the woman's unit, in protective custody.  Oh, great.  Because all the inmates are talking about killing him.  Who, the guy that ran out of the theater? 
[00:46:30]  Should be in there.  This guy, this fucking, he's, all the inmates want to kill him.  Yeah.  And he's, they said he's spitting at guards, he's pretending he's the Joker.  No, he's not.  Fucking kill this guy.  No, no, he thinks he's the Joker.  He's in a movie.  Strangle him.  Because he has not had any penalty yet.  What he needs to happen is they need to walk him and allow a couple of people to drill their convict fists in the side of his face. 
[00:47:00]  A sound thrashing.  One fucking broken jaw.  You know what?  One fist coming through a bar and connecting with his teeth will take this guy out of his, I'm the Joker role play.  And realize, I'm in for a horrible existence here.  Yeah, one of the broads will take him out.  Hopefully.  One of the broads could easily take him out.  Shanked with a hairbrush handle.  We've all seen the MSNBC shows.  Oh, lock up.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy fuck, those broads are scary. 
[00:47:30]  Not quite the attractive young convicts in there.  Put him in the yard with the broads.  The broads will absolutely take care of this asshole.  He's fucking strangle him.  He's definitely being kept away from anything.  The Joker.  Joker.  He thinks he's the Joker.  He thinks he's in a movie.  Yeah, just take a giant meaty fist and pound his face.  I don't even mean kill him.  I mean, like, the first time, because right now, he's still like the evil guy. 
[00:48:00]  No one has addressed him the way he should be addressed.  Yes.  Which is having, first of all, of course, having his teeth knocked out and his jaw broke.  But those are tangible things.  Like, those are not, you know, the death penalty someday.  Having your jaw wired shut is a real thing.  Or having teeth fucking, having gum pain because your teeth have been punched out is a real fucking thing.  And once he gets a dose of that, he's going to realize that he's in a fucking very bad place. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And that's how the paper should be addressing this little cunt.  Like, he is the broken little nobody that he is.  I'm not saying don't talk about it, but the fucking New York Post, putting this guy on the cover, like, the crazed Joker plot to escape.  Literally, you are not only giving him what he wants, but you're encouraging other people to do it.  Yeah.  You really are.  And they've shown that in study after study, profiler after profiler says that.  People that are nobodies that want to be a somebody, they take this route. 
[00:49:00]  Yep.  And look, hey, he's a somebody.  And now he's getting what he wants because he's an anti-hero.  Like, Alex in Clockwork Orange was an anti-hero.  That's what this guy is to a lot of people.  What about Uncle Hero, too?  Oh, Jesus Christ, Colby, are you fucking crazy?  It's been brought up before, but it's funny how they'll show this guy over and over again.  But they consistently don't show people running out on the field in sporting events.  I retweeted someone who said that. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, someone said that.  Because they don't want to encourage other people to do it.  Yes.  It's a great point.  Yeah, because we just suck.  Yep.  Now, that's got something to do with probably the venues putting their foot down.  That's got something to do.  But what a great point.  They don't want to encourage other people to do it, so they don't show it.  Yeah.  But this guy, they will put on the front page his evil glare.  Ooh.  He's the joker.  And I know you've got to name him. 
[00:50:00]  He's a criminal.  I mean, it's a real story.  You can't not do it on principle.  Yeah, yeah.  But to call him this and to talk about him the way...  Like, literally, if this guy had written...  James Hallman.  If he had written these headlines, this is how he would have written them.  That's how he would have wanted them written.  They're fucking...  Yeah.  These papers.  But meanwhile, you know, you do a rape joke or whatever.  Right.  You're a terrible person, but the public tolerates this.  This is what you do.  You get the CIA involved, and you fucking take this asshole out immediately.  And everyone goes, I don't really know what the fuck happened, man. 
[00:50:30]  He was guarded and turned our back for a second.  He died in his cell.  Yeah.  That's why that conspiracy and secret government shit doesn't work.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because this is a perfect case where you should do something.  Well, he's a patsy, because apparently, how I've heard, the government...  I was going to stage this whole thing.  Did we get the Alex Jones audio for today?  He's a complete lunatic.  Everything to him is a conspiracy.  Everything.  Could you get a clip of Alex Jones?  We should have had it today.  He is out of his mind.  Even I think he's an idiot on this one. 
[00:51:00]  Nice.  Yeah, he thinks this is some kind of psyops.  He loves saying psyops.  Please.  How long did it take for us to get rid of Timothy McVeigh?  Yeah, it was a few years, definitely.  But how many?  Because, I mean, that's a death penalty case that should have been, like...  Was it 10 years?  1, 2, 3.  Was it about 10 years?  I'm thinking.  Let me see.  I think it was longer than 10.  You also had another guy testifying against him, though, which made it a lot easier to nail him. 
[00:51:30]  Terry Nichols.  Yeah.  Who did not get the death penalty.  It helps that there's someone else testifying.  And didn't he, at the end, say that he didn't want any more appeals?  Yeah.  So...  Yeah, it was up to him, finally.  Yeah.  He finally said, look, just kill me.  How many years did it take to kill him?  Way too many is my point here.  Does anyone know the...  He was...  They killed him in 2000.  So...  What?  It says they killed him in 2000.  Did they?  No.  Was it... 
[00:52:00]  Was that it?  What?  Hey, Soup Jew.  Was that it?  It was 90...  Wasn't it 94 that it happened?  95.  April of 95.  95.  They killed him past 2000.  What did...  Uh...  2001.  June 11, 2001.  That's when he died.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Took six years, though.  There was something satisfying that he never even got to see 9-11, though.  Because he would have loved that.  He would have loved that.  Yeah.  He missed 9-11 by a couple months.  Good.  Fucker. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Six years.  Well, that's sort of speedy.  Yeah, well...  It kind of is.  As far as death penalty goes...  Yeah.  That one's kind of speedy.  Six years.  But again, he was the one that had to go like, fuck, no more appeals, no more nothing.  Just...  How long is the Alex Jones?  Inside the Joker's lair.  Uh-oh.  They're calling him the Joker.  Oh, just shoot him.  Don't call him the Joker.  They're all a fucking part of it.  And they know it encourages more, and they don't give a fuck.  They don't care.  Just strangle him.  Is that a fucking mole on that broad's face?  No, it's a bullet wound. 
[00:53:00]  Oh.  Jeez.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, my God.  I feel like a complete idiot.  Who is that?  She has her chin.  This is Greg Hughes.  I feel like a complete idiot.  What?  Is that really a bullet wound?  Yeah, they're interviewing a girl.  She had a tooth knocked out.  She must have gotten, like...  I'm sorry.  ...grazed on the chin.  For real, I'm sorry.  I thought you meant the fucking newscaster.  No, man.  I saw them interviewing this girl, and I just looked up.  I didn't...  Oh, I'm sorry.  She got whacked.  Idiot.  Oh, all right.  With a little boy.  Yeah.  I care.  Sorry. 
[00:53:30]  For real, sorry.  You didn't know.  I'll make fun of a mole, no problem, but...  I guess a lot of people couldn't help but see the Christian Bale wart slash mole.  Good.  Ah, that.  The fucking...  Everyone had moles.  Yeah.  How great is that?  Yeah.  It annoyed all of them.  It annoyed everybody.  Weepy Alfred.  Supposedly, his voice was easier to understand if you weren't in the IMAX.  Yeah.  Supposedly.  That's what I...  Reports that I got.  And you know how we were killed... 
[00:54:00]  I was killed on MSNBC when it was happening for not covering it accurately or enough, and  people were like, why are you mad that they're over-covering it when you were killed?  Because when it's an active news story, like when they're still pulling people out of  the theater, I would like complete coverage.  It makes sense to me.  Of course.  An hour after it happened...  Because it's still news at that point.  They're still bringing witnesses out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  There's a difference between getting the constant coverage because the network is prepared  or not prepared, and cartooning it with the Joker's lair. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  The Joker's lair.  The Joker.  Just fucking kill him.  No, he's spitting on the guards.  Guess what?  Because he's the Joker.  Oh, he's crazy.  Look out.  Guess what?  We're not better than that as a society.  Take him out back and shoot him in the head.  Yeah.  Be wonderful.  And then the next guy might think twice about it.  Start there.  And then you can discuss gun control, death penalty, all that other shit.  Take him off the fucking planet first.  One caved in fucking mouth, and this guy will feel differently.  Oh, he'll fucking...  His Joker fantasy... 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  ...with a broken jaw or shattered teeth.  Now, the cops have to protect him, which is unfortunate, but they do.  I would love to talk to one of those guys.  Like, I understand.  Trust me.  Yeah, they have to.  I really do understand, but I would love to talk to you about it.  Like, that's gotta kill you inside.  Because if they didn't have to protect him, they would be knocking his teeth out.  Right.  That's all...  Basically...  How weird is that?  They're the protectors.  They're walking down the corridors or whatever, knowing, I want to fucking do something to  this guy.  But that's why they have that, because, like, other prisoners would do something, but you're 
[00:55:30]  legally responsible for a guy when he's in state care?  Because literally, the guards would...  I think the guards would be more likely to beat the shit out of this guy than that phony  street justice the convicts have.  The guards would be more likely to fucking...  I think you're right.  ...take this guy's fucking jaw off than other convicts.  I love the fact that these inmates have a level of honor among themselves.  I don't even think they do.  Well, they're all saying how they want to take him out.  You don't believe that shit?  Nah, pedophiles survive in jail. 
[00:56:00]  Once in a while, someone does the right thing.  Pedophiles survive.  Rapists survive in jail.  Yeah.  I think more of these guys would be taken out, but that's how well they're protected.  Maybe, yeah.  In the end.  I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer, they wanted him forever, and then if, you know, finally the guy got  him with what, the...  But that wasn't even over what he did.  I know.  No, it's some prison beef.  Like a beef.  Like having a beef with somebody.  I think if you're in jail for a bunch of life sentences, you would absolutely be the guy 
[00:56:30]  that would just take him out.  Yeah.  For a cred in the prison.  Well, he'll be in fucking protective custody.  Fuck it.  You're never going to fucking hear about him getting killed.  Yeah.  Well, the next idiot that we're going to talk about is Alex Jones.  He says, is Batman Massacre staged terror?  What?  Can we do it after the break?  I got to pee really bad.  Yeah.  Where's our grub?  Oh, here it comes.  And also Joe Paterno.  We'll get into that shit as well. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNF Today Show.  Nothing?  Excuse me.  Nothing wrong with Rush, huh?  Still not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Canadians.  They know how to play their instruments.  Yeah, unbelievably well.  My God.  Why the Rush?  That's what she should have said to her boyfriend  as he jumped out of the fucking...  He left his fucking girl 
[00:57:30]  and a four-year-old and a four-month-old  that he fathered in the fucking balcony  while he jumped.  You definitely don't live that down.  No.  No.  No.  Well, did the guy come in the balcony?  Is that what it was?  No.  No, no, no.  I think the balcony, relatively speaking,  I'll say it again,  was the safest place that night.  He was down by the screen.  Yeah.  So why was this guy jumping down?  Like, wouldn't this guy be jumping... 
[00:58:00]  Probably because the gunman at that point  moved toward the back of the theater.  And he might have thought he was coming up the steps.  Maybe.  And then he's thinking...  Old panicky Pete.  Now I could jump and run out the exit.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I would love to know  because I really want to be wrong.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Leaves his four-month-old.  I can't...  Can you think of any circumstance  where you would leave your son?  No, of course not.  I mean...  But also, I'm just wondering  the level of panic  and if that just rewires your brain.  I don't know.  Didn't rewire the mother's brain.  She stayed.  I think... 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I think...  No, she didn't stay.  She ran with the other kid.  She took her kids, though.  She didn't...  No.  There were two kids.  Yeah.  She took the four-year-old.  The four-month-old was with him.  No.  No.  No.  She took...  He left both his kids.  Oh, and she came back  and grabbed the other one,  I guess, then, right?  She had both the kids.  She had both the ones.  No, but he's saying  that he had one.  No, no.  No, no.  He was a free...  No, he didn't have a kid.  He left them both.  Left them both.  That's what I'm complaining about.  When he said that, he said...  Why was he debating the whole  jumping with the four-month-old, then? 
[00:59:00]  He said...  First, he said  that he was going to jump  with the four-month-old,  then he couldn't...  Turned around,  couldn't find him,  so he jumped anyway.  Because she grabbed both kids  and ran.  Yeah, he jumped  without his children.  Yeah, that's kind of dumb.  He left both of his kids.  And then the black guy  came up and got her  and the kids.  Yeah, she should be  marrying the black guy.  If he took his son,  I wouldn't be faulting him.  If he took his kid and ran,  and she took the four-year-old,  I wouldn't be criticizing him.  Gotcha now.  He did something.  She should marry her protector,  the black guy.  The mind of James Holmes. 
[00:59:30]  Good job, CNN.  The mind.  Yeah, he's a coward,  and he's a crazy person.  Period.  Now shoot him in the fucking head  and let's move on.  That's how you take care  of this shit.  Because people talk about  gun control and all that.  The fact is,  wow, that is a bullet wound.  I feel like a complete idiot.  So where did the bullet go in?  Shot in chin.  It probably grazed her.  Oh, that's a graze.  So that's a big scab.  And knocked her tooth out,  though, she also, 
[01:00:00]  so it probably,  bang, really fucking slammed her.  It probably felt like  she got punched.  That's gotta hurt.  Yeah.  You think that her tooth aches?  Yeah.  But that scar will suck,  but it's also a great reminder.  Like, every day,  if something's wrong,  if you look at that scar,  you're like,  wow, I should be dead.  Like, that's a reminder  of how fucking lucky  you are to be alive, too.  And gun control  is one of those issues,  but the fact is this,  and the facts are the facts.  The guy, you know,  you could have done  a million background checks 
[01:00:30]  on the guy.  He was gonna get a gun  because he had a speeding ticket.  That's it.  Yeah.  So even if you clamped down  on making it even harder  to get guns,  this individual  would have got guns.  Yeah.  Even with tougher gun laws.  Yeah, exactly.  He had what?  Just a speeding ticket  on his record?  That was it?  That's it.  He didn't have any kind  of psych issues  at the time.  So it's easy to say,  you know,  tougher gun laws,  but the fact...  He qualified.  Why do I keep saying  the same shit? 
[01:01:00]  But he would have got a gun  even if it really clamped down.  So it's not as easy  as that, people.  His home's mentally ill.  You're gonna get  a semi-automatic, people.  I can't even deal anymore.  I did my Twitter thing.  I did a compound show on it.  Just deal with that.  I'm so fucking sick of it.  Well, this is Bloomberg.  We got Bloomberg.  I've noticed people  that are arguing  for more gun control  really don't know much 
[01:01:30]  about guns or gun laws already.  That's what I'm noticing.  People that have guns,  you have to know  about guns and gun laws.  If you're a responsible  legal gun owner,  you gotta know  about those things.  It's your life.  You could perhaps  go to jail if you don't.  And people that are  for more gun control,  they're just there  for more gun control.  So they don't really  educate themselves.  I had one guy.  He asked me on Twitter,  what's the difference  between a semi-automatic 
[01:02:00]  and an automatic?  Which is fine  if you don't know that.  I have no qualms  about somebody  not knowing that.  But then I started  looking at his  previous tweets  before that.  And they were all like,  they should ban this.  Why was this guy  allowed to get that?  It's like,  how could you argue  for gun control  when you don't even know  what certain guns do  or what's banned already  and what isn't banned?  He didn't go in  with a machine gun.  That's not even,  it's very difficult  for a civilian  to get a machine gun. 
[01:02:30]  You gotta be  in the right state.  Massive paperwork,  huge fucking money.  But people are talking  like anyone  in this day and age  could just walk  into a store  and buy a machine gun.  No.  It was a semi-automatic  assault weapon.  Really?  It's exactly like  a hunting rifle,  a semi-automatic  hunting rifle  that you see,  the big wooden stock,  the magazine  that goes in the bottom  and a scope on top  and you shoot a deer  or something like that.  That's exactly 
[01:03:00]  what an assault weapon is  except it looks  like it looks  more military.  It doesn't do  anything different  than any other  semi-automatic  wooden stock  hunting rifle does.  They like to make  it sound like  why are people  allowed to buy those?  Does it shoot  50 to 60 rounds  in a minute?  It shoots bullets  as quickly  as you can pull  the trigger.  That's what it is.  You gotta pull  the trigger.  Every time you  want a bullet  to fly out the front,  you gotta pull  the trigger.  So it sounds 
[01:03:30]  like you could just  ba-da-da-da-da-da  but it's,  you know,  if you want  to accurately shoot,  you can't just  sit there going  and pulling  the trigger  quickly.  But that's  what it is  and it's no  different than  a lot of  people's  hunting rifles.  That's just  what it is.  But it looks  badass.  It's got a lot  of plastic  parts on it.  It's got the  rails to put  laser sights  and scopes  on and everything  else but  no difference.  people are 
[01:04:00]  very uninformed  when it comes  to this.  They don't  know what  the laws  are.  And then  they say,  well,  I bring up  the point  that Detroit  and Chicago  and D.C.  have the  strictest gun  laws in the  country and  the highest  rate of gun  crimes in the  country.  And then  someone says,  well,  it's because  surrounding states  have lax gun  laws.  So people buy  them there  and then  bring them  to these  other places.  And that's  breaking the  law. 
[01:04:30]  Because people  are under the  impression,  by the way,  that you can  legally just  go and buy a  gun somewhere,  like Arizona,  somewhere where  the gun laws  are pretty lax,  and then just  go to New  York and go,  well,  I couldn't buy  it in New  York,  but I bought  it in Arizona  and here I  am with my  gun.  No.  You're now  a criminal  who has  broken the  law and  you can go  to prison  for that.  There's  regulations in  place.  There already  are.  It's not the  wild west as  far as  people buying  guns.  The problem  is there's  going to be  people that  do this  shit. 
[01:05:00]  There's going  to be people  that lose  their fucking  minds and  kill a lot  of people.  And people  want an answer  for it because  it scares them  that there's  no answer.  It's a  frightening  prospect that  no matter  what you do,  this is still  going to happen  at some time  and place.  I don't think  there's an easy  answer.  I don't think  there's an easy  solution.  But it's because  it's human nature.  This all boils  down to this  guy is a human  being that  malfunctioned and  there's nothing  that can stop  that.  You're always 
[01:05:30]  going to have  people that are  fucked up.  We're not  machines.  There's no  fix.  There's no  turn of an  idle screw.  It's a guy  and he decided  he was going  to kill people.  And when people  decide that,  whether they  use a gun  or a car  or knives  or whatever  the fuck  they use,  and the whole  thing of,  well, you  could kill  more people  with a gun  than a knife.  Yeah, you  can.  But you  know what?  If I decided  to take my  fucking truck  and barrel  it into  Times Square  and mow  down people, 
[01:06:00]  I could  guarantee you  I'll get  more than  12 people  killed if I  fly in at  70 miles an  hour into  crowded Times  Square.  It's people  that want to  kill people  are going to  kill people.  It's been  proven over the  years.  You know,  you don't need a  gunned Timothy  McVeigh.  You didn't  fire a shot.  I just don't  trust people  with guns.  I don't trust  people with  illegal guns.  I don't trust  people that  are irresponsible 
[01:06:30]  with guns.  I barely trust  people with  their cars.  I don't trust  people with  guns.  People are a  lot less  trustworthy with  their cars  than with  guns.  Legal gun  owners are  pretty responsible.  When you  wouldn't think  of the amount  of people that  do own guns  in this country  and how many  people are  actually killed  with guns.  And I mean  crime related  because a lot  of these stats  include legitimate  self-defense  killings,  police.  It's just  homicide by  gun includes  police in the  line of duty  killing somebody. 
[01:07:00]  So we  understand your  stand on this  but how do  we make it  better?  That's my  question today.  Very simple  to you.  How do we  make it better?  Because obviously  there's a lot  of gun violence  in this country  more than  other countries.  How do we  make it better?  I think we  are.  There's no way  you can avoid  this.  This is such  a rare instance.  No, I know  but I'm just  saying in general  the gun issue.  How do we  make it better?  Because it's a  hot topic for  a lot of people.  What needs  to be made  better?  Let's say  what needs  to be made  better first? 
[01:07:30]  The fact that  a lot of people  are being killed  by guns?  Well, it seems  like a lot of  people are being  killed by guns.  So what do we  do as a country  to make it a little  better?  How about cracking  down on the laws  that are out  there already?  It's pretty  illegal to have  guns in a lot  of the people  that are shooting  in Chicago and  Detroit.  Those are illegal  guns that they're  using.  Boy, they sure  didn't want to  continue at stop  and frisk with  people that they  suspect might be  doing something.  They jump in on  that.  I don't know. 
[01:08:00]  I don't know  what the answer  is.  All I know  is, as far  as the Constitution  goes, you're  entitled to  protect yourself  in the best  means you see  fit.  The best means  I see fit to  protect myself,  my loved ones,  is to have the  great equalizer,  a gun, which  puts you on  equal footing  with anyone  trying to do  anything with you.  What the result  will be in  certain circumstances? 
[01:08:30]  No one knows,  but I'll tell you  one thing.  It's not going  to be the  stronger guy.  It's not going  to be the  person that  maybe has  more friends  with him.  It's not going  to be the  guy that kicks  your door open  with a fucking  gun, even.  Or with the  better hat.  Right, the  better hat.  You're now on  equal ground.  It's the  detente, the  great equalizer.  And for anyone  to tell me I  can't use a  certain thing to  protect myself,  that's horse  shit.  Tex Punch  him.  What needs  to change 
[01:09:00]  is the  punishment  for breaking  current gun  laws.  What's that?  What needs  to change  is the  punishment  for breaking  current gun  laws.  Make them  crazy.  You start  fucking  throwing the  death  penalties  on these  people.  Yeah.  I think we  got to get  drastic with  how we handle  people that  are using  guns illegally.  People also  have another  misconception.  The Second  Amendment isn't  the right to  hunt.  people think  it's like  if you  can't  fucking  hunt  with a 
[01:09:30]  single shot  rifle and  you need a  semi-automatic  that's a  it's not  about hunting.  It's about  the Second  Amendment being  that you have  the right  to bear  arms,  to have  weapons to  protect yourself  from an  invasion of  your house  or an  invasion by  your government.  And that is a  dumb argument  because I would  assume if you  were hunting it  would be kind of  cool to have an  assault rifle or  it would make  it a little  more fun.  It would  make it fun  but boy the  traditional hunters  don't like those.  Oh I understand  that. 
[01:10:00]  They would argue  that point as  well.  Unloading.  But I could  see where that  would be fun  for some people.  What does  detente mean?  It's like a  balance of  power.  It's like we  had with the  Russians.  It's mutual  annihilation.  So one person  doesn't do  something because  they know that  they're probably  going to get  the same thing  in return.  What kind of  word is that?  I'm asking for  a reason.  I think it's  French.  It was in a  John Valby song  and I never  understood what  it meant.  It was in one  of his  and I never 
[01:10:30]  heard it.  Wow okay.  And the last  line of the  limbo is chalk  up one more  for detente.  Oh oh.  Which I guess  means that and  I never knew  what the fuck  that meant  until you just  said it.  You get a  little education  on this program.  Yes I do!  Here's Bloomberg.  Somebody's got to  do something about  this and this  requires and  particularly in a  presidential year.  The candidates  for president  of the United  States to  stand up and  once and for  all say yes  they feel 
[01:11:00]  terrible.  Yes it's a  tragedy.  Yes we have  great sympathy  for the families  but it's time  for this country  to do something.  And that's the  job of the  president of the  United States.  And I don't  know what  they're going to  do but I think  it's incumbent on  them to tell us  specifically not just  in broad terms.  You know  Governor Romney  when he was  governor of  Massachusetts  actually passed  a ban on  assault weapons.  And President  Obama when he  came into office 
[01:11:30]  in 2008  said he would  reinstitute the  ban, the federal  ban on assault  weapons.  And the governor  has apparently  changed his views  and the president  has spent the  last three years  trying to avoid  the issue or  if he's facing  it I don't know  anybody that's  seen him face  it.  And it's time  for both of  them to be  called, held  accountable.  I'll say this  much, at least  he's talking  about a real  issue.  Whether you  agree or  disagree, at 
[01:12:00]  least he's  talking about  a real issue  instead of  that sugary  drink crap.  It's hard not  to talk about  it now.  Like this is  one of those  things where  gun owners have  to know.  It's almost  like when  there's a drunk  driving accident  that's high  profile, everyone  talks.  Yeah, everybody's  going to talk  about this.  There's no way  you're not  going to have  guys talking  about getting  rid of guns  right now.  It's just  whenever there's  stuff like  this, it's  what people  talk about.  I love how  the mayor  brings up  assault weapons  again and  everybody's  talking assault  weapons.  And this  is an FBI  crime statistic.  4% of 
[01:12:30]  crimes, murders  actually, 4%  of homicides  were done  with a rifle.  4% out of  all of them  were a rifle.  And that's  every rifle.  If you just  whittle it down  to assault  weapons, it's  a fraction  of that.  It's not that  big a fucking  problem.  It's really not  taking care of  the issue.  No one's  taking assault  weapons.  So what is the  number one?  Handguns?  Handguns are  like 70% of  homicide with 
[01:13:00]  guns.  Aren't they  considered the  semi-automatic?  Aren't the  assault weapons  the handguns?  When he's  saying assault  weapons, isn't he  talking more about  automatic or  semi-automatic handguns?  No.  With the  assault weapon  ban that was  in place, it  was just about  the rifles.  And let me  tell you what  constitutes an  assault weapon  in a lot of  places.  Here's something  I'm not allowed  to own because  it constitutes an  assault weapon.  If I have an  AR-15, which I 
[01:13:30]  do, and it  has, here's one  of the criteria,  a bayonet lug.  If I have a  bayonet lug, which  is the attachment  to put a bayonet  on the end of  your fucking  gun, that is  one of the  things that  constitute an  assault weapon.  When was the  last time anyone  was hurt in a  bayonet charge as  a robbery or  shooting was  going on?  A stock, a  movable stock, one  that goes in and  out, because in  certain situations,  a circumstance  down at the 
[01:14:00]  range, long-range  shooting or shorter  shooting, you want  to adjust your  stock in or out a  couple of inches.  If your stock  adjusts, that's a  fucking assault  weapon.  If it has a  muzzle brake on  the end, which  is a flash  suppressor, something  on the end of the  gun that looks  cool, that is  another thing that  constitutes an  assault weapon.  It's all this  aesthetic shit that  really has nothing  to do with the  meat of the  situation, which  is, it's a 
[01:14:30]  semi-automatic  rifle, just like  your dad's  hunting rifle.  And people,  though, they get  there's so much  misinformation out  there that people  literally think that  you can go into a  store now and buy a  machine gun.  And that's what the  people are going,  we've got to stop  this, military guns  are being sold to  civilians.  No.  Sounds like shallow  victories, really.  Yeah.  I mean, you get  these victories, but  it doesn't really  solve the actual  problem.  No, no, it  really doesn't. 
[01:15:00]  Let me, the  phones, let's see if  we want to take any  of these.  On Facebook, blacks and  Hispanics are saying  that he's getting  special treatment because  he's white.  Oh, yeah, they're  very angry.  Maybe they're, is he  being treated differently  than a, I don't know.  They say if a black guy  shoots up a place, he's a  thug or gangster or  drug dealer.  If a Hispanic shoots up  something, they say, oh,  it must be an illegal  immigrant.  If an Arab shoots it up,  he's a terrorist.  And if a white guy  shoots it up, he's a  crazy white guy.  He's got a mental  problem.  But in general, that's  how it works.  That is how it works.  In general, that's how  it works.  They look into his past,  they look into what 
[01:15:30]  caused it, what did it,  but, and, you know,  there is a point there in  how the media handles  it.  You know what, if a  black guy walks into a  party and shoots, and I  understand this is  different because he  planned it and he  plotted it and he  painted his hair red.  It's a crazy white guy  thing.  But you don't, when a  black guy walks into a  party and shoots it up,  you don't say what's  wrong with him mentally,  what is he going through.  We assume we know.  We just, we assume we  know.  Poverty, lack of a father  in the family, growing up  in a drug culture, you 
[01:16:00]  know, we all have...  Lack of edumacation.  Lack of edumacation, all  that good stuff.  That's a good point.  I mean, they're not  wrong, but it's crazy  white guy.  Crazy white guy.  And crazy white guy  gets crazy white guy  coverage, which is  non-stop.  But when it comes to  like blacks or  Hispanics, it almost,  and again, we always  talk about the media  treating them like this  is just how they act.  Right.  That's a prime example.  This is the same media,  by the way, that doesn't  want to mention black on  white crime when it's got  racial implications as a  racial crime. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  The same ones who cover  a white guy doing it  like it's this crazy  anomaly of a madman.  Yeah.  But when you guys do it,  par for the course,  that's just an average  Saturday.  Well, the truth of the  matter is, this is a very  rare occurrence that  happens, and shootings in  black communities, it's  very common.  So I think...  I think that's why...  I mean a mass murder,  though.  Like a mass murder.  Gang shootings are one  thing, but a guy walking  into a place and just  shooting it up, which...  Black guys don't normally  do that. 
[01:17:00]  They do it at parties.  They don't do it here,  but that's where it  happens.  When a guy gets kicked  out of a party, he goes  back...  But it's never some  planned, psychopathic...  You have this deep,  lunatic thing going on.  It's very impulsive.  You know, yeah, I got  kicked out of a party.  Let me go fucking spray  the goddamn house.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it is almost a  that's expected, so let's  not even try to dig deep  into who this guy is,  because we all know what  the answer will be.  Right.  And with white guy, it's  like, whoa, this must be  some weird anomaly.  Crazy evil genius. 
[01:17:30]  Let's...  In a way, it is weird,  though.  He's booby-trapping his  apartment, dying his hair  fucking orange, not even  red.  What the fuck?  Just kill the guy.  I think he's a joker.  Some guy goes,  how is putting a bullet  in Holmes' head going to  act as a deterrent when  95% of these cases ended  in the shooter killing  himself?  God, look at this.  Somebody right here is  saying...  I guess you might have a  point there, but at least  this guy will be off the  fucking earth.  Somebody right here is  saying, I was under the  impression that an assault  weapon was a machine gun.  They never clarify things 
[01:18:00]  on the news.  Well...  They don't want people  informed on this, and  like I said, the least  informed people about guns  that I've seen are people  that want them banned.  At least get a fucking  education about what  you're trying to take  away from law-abiding  citizens.  Well, let's see if we  want to take any of these  calls.  If we had more guns, he  would have thought twice  walking in there and  shooting up.  That's speculation.  No one knows what  would have happened.  We have a ban of guns  in D.C., but there are  still so many guns here.  If people knew how to 
[01:18:30]  use guns, it would have  helped.  Right.  And assault weapons are  not used for hunting.  Yeah, it is illegal to  use for hunting, but he  was just saying what a  pisser it would be to  just spray poor Bambi  with fucking 30 rounds.  Oh, God.  That would be terrible.  I think it would ruin  the meat.  I think it would ruin  the meat.  It would be a little  medley.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  The debate will continue.  I think the answer is  everybody just needs to  have a cup of tea and be 
[01:19:00]  nicer to each other.  Oh, wouldn't that be  lovely?  From your mouth to  God's ears.  Everybody needs to knit  themselves in Afghan and  just simmer down a little  bit.  Let's have a cup of  coffee at Zanish and  just talk.  We love to debate in  this country, but nothing  really moves.  No, no.  This issue will not  change anytime soon.  And people criticize the  NRA a lot because of  their hard tactics the  other way, but it's the  only way we're going to  hold on to these rights.  And if there's any  misinterpretation of the  Second Amendment, just  look at the quotes of the 
[01:19:30]  people that fucking wrote  it.  Could you just do that  and not just the actual  amendment itself, but  quotes about gun  ownership by the people  that penned it and see  what their actual thought  process was when they came  up with the Second  Amendment?  It absolutely they wanted  an armed public.  They wanted them armed  and not just for a  tyrannical government and  prevention thereof, but to 
[01:20:00]  protect themselves.  What changed in your life  that you're such a gun?  I've always been.  I'm going to say  such a queer.  I was going to say gun  nut, but not like nut.  You know, you're over the  top with your guns now.  Over the top.  I've known you for 18  years, and most of that  time you didn't even own  one, and now you own a  bunch.  And you're all in with  guns now.  I'm all in with my right.  Something you weren't all  in with for most of the 
[01:20:30]  time I've known you.  What changed in your  life?  I don't know.  I mean, you casually say,  I always liked guns.  I used to shoot with my  dad out in California, but  then you ramped it up.  You're like really into  guns now.  Because I guess as I, when  I got my pistol license, I  started to see the real  fucking, the real issues  with people trying to  infringe on your right to  bear arms.  And if any other right was  infringed upon that much,  there'd be a fucking  outcry.  But the thing is, a lot 
[01:21:00]  of people don't have  guns, don't understand  them, don't understand  the Second Amendment,  and, but they're totally  willing to jump into the  fray of this argument  without being very  informed about it.  You know what I think it  is?  When Anthony bought his  house.  That was when.  It's because when you're  in apartments, you are  protected.  Because you're, I feel  safe in my apartment,  because I'm in a building.  I'm surrounded by people.  Yeah.  But when you are in a  house, there is no  neighbor that is like 
[01:21:30]  literally bang on the  wall.  You're on your own.  You are more on your  own.  And it seems like that  was when you became  into guns because, I  mean, I mean, in this  party, because, because  you're alone.  I also enjoy, let me just  also say, I, it's not  just this paranoia thing.  I enjoy shooting.  I enjoy going to the  range with a lot of  various weapons.  And I think I've been  lucky to have a career  that offers me the  financial resources to  buy a lot of exotic 
[01:22:00]  weaponry and shoot it  at ranges.  Because you know what?  It's fun.  It's just fun to do.  It's like shooting  darts with the fire  crackers going off.  It's just fun to try to  hit a target and  challenge yourself.  Mike in Jersey.  Let's just forget it  that, Anthony.  We'll just keep  hailing innocent people  as heroes, lowering the  flag to half-mast, and  letting the media compete  for ratings by going over  each and every detail of 
[01:22:30]  the incident, including  trying to figure out why  and why's in capital  letters.  So what would have  prevented this guy from  having a gun?  What would have done it?  Eliminate the Second  Amendment completely, or  what?  Or put this guy through  the mill to try to  weed him out?  Sometimes people aren't  going to be weeded out.  That's what happened  with this guy.  I wish these guys  would call.  I mean, they're angry  on his feedback.  You should call the  show, though.  I think he continues.  It looks like the  same guy.  Stop trying to justify  this.  You're a nutcase who  wears guns to protect. 
[01:23:00]  What when were you last  robbed at gunpoint?  It doesn't matter.  See, that's another  argument.  Let me fucking say  this to that guy.  It happens.  What are you living?  Where are you living?  Where it just happens  to people on television?  It just happens.  No, I haven't been robbed  or fucking assaulted  or had my life threatened  up close and personal  face to face.  But that doesn't mean  it doesn't happen. 
[01:23:30]  And mark my fucking  words, if you, sir,  were in a circumstance  where your loved ones  were being assaulted  or somebody broke into  your house and had a  weapon, you would sure  as fuck want to have a  gun.  all these motherfuckers.  Oh, when was the last  time that happened to  you?  It hasn't.  Doesn't mean it's not  going to.  And the biggest fucking  tragedy I can imagine  is having your gun at  home when something  happens to you and not 
[01:24:00]  being able to use it to  protect yourself or a  loved one.  How do you live with  that?  And this guy said,  don't don't say because  I like having guns that  I should only have one  if something happens to  me.  It's called being  prepared for something.  People are fucking  look what happened.  People.  There's bad people out  there.  I'm not paranoid thinking  they're all over the  place.  Ah, but you know what?  It's something you have  to be prepared for.  People do get fucked up 
[01:24:30]  by people that enjoy  hurting other other  people.  And this guy in the  theater, who knows?  Who knows what would  have happened if there  was one or two  citizens in there?  Well-versed in  firearms that were  able to, you know,  react.  You would have shot  in that theater,  wouldn't you?  If it was prudent,  yes, of course.  One more from Mike.  I wish you would call  the show.  Maybe you can't for  whatever reason. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  Well, just keep  debating and nothing  will change because  you need to be selfish  enough to quote the  Second Amendment.  That amendment was  written during the  development of a new  country based on  being created during  a war and martial  law.  Oh, stop it.  That isn't it.  They penned the Bill  of Rights and the  Second Amendment, the  First Amendment.  All these things were  put in place for a  nation to look to  and to use as a 
[01:25:30]  foundation.  They're not dated.  These are things put in  place for a free  country like we have,  you fucking idiot.  Greg in Huntington  Beach.  To your point, I live  in L.A., got robbed  at gunpoint a month  ago.  I wish I had a gun.  There you go.  And maybe, you know  what, even if you have  a gun, in certain  circumstances, the best  thing is just to comply.  Give me your fucking  money.  What are you going to  do?  I'm not saying, I'm  not fucking Mr. Wild  West here.  I'm not saying, yeah, I'd 
[01:26:00]  fucking be in that  theater.  I'd have taken that  motherfucker out.  No, the best thing  might have been to just  duck.  But, you know, you  don't know that.  The worst possible  scenario, I'll give you  the worst possible  scenario.  A guy in a movie  theater, the only one  with a gun, shooting  at a door full of  fucking people trying  to get out.  That's the worst  scenario.  I think another  person with a gun in  there that's a  responsible citizen  might have been able  to at least distract 
[01:26:30]  the guy, even though  he's wearing body  armor.  If a couple of  rounds hit him, it's  not, it's definitely  going to fucking get  his attention.  And what, his gun  jammed?  It would have been  even worse.  Yeah, one of those  big fucking 100  round rotary clip  gizmos drums, which  yeah, again, illegal.  That's an illegal  gun?  Firing off.  Yeah.  Attaching the drum  makes it illegal.  The drum, a 100  round drum.  But you can get the  drum online?  Yeah.  Legally? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  That seems weird to  me.  The drums.  That you can get  something that's  legal, but then it  becomes illegal when  you add it onto your  gun.  A lot of things are  grandfathered in with  laws, so when they  ban something, they  have to ban it from a  certain year forward.  They have to let  whatever it is run  out.  You know, so there's  certain magazines that  were pre-1996, I think  it is, you're allowed to  have.  You know what, though?  This is where the NRA 
[01:27:30]  loses me.  If it's something like  a 100 round drum, I  think that we, the  public, have the right  to say we don't want  citizens having that  under any circumstances.  75?  Huh?  50?  Where do you stop?  I think that...  Where do you stop?  I would say I'm  comfortable with the  nine, like, round  clip, whatever cops  carry, like, in that  area, but I mean,  because I don't know  the exact number, but  I know that there's a  line way before a 
[01:28:00]  hundred that I'm  comfortable with.  Because I'm four  people having weapons  and protecting  themselves, but a  hundred round drum.  I don't agree with a  hundred round drum  myself.  But the NRA will  fight that.  They'll fight that.  Yeah.  But I have no problem  with them fighting that  because they're tugging  on the rope with the  other end, which is  trying to completely  annihilate the second  man.  But that's what  Sharpton does.  Sharpton does the  same thing.  He's pulling on that  rope for the same  reason.  That's his argument,  is if I don't fight 
[01:28:30]  at all, I'm letting  something go.  Exactly, and he does.  Educate me on the  NRA a little bit.  Are they all or  nothing with this stuff?  For the most part,  yes.  They're pretty much  all or nothing.  They are, for the  most part.  Do you agree with  that, or do you feel  like there could be a  little leeway?  I like having an  organization there  that's willing to  really take it into  the trenches with the  people that would  have every gun taken  away from everybody.  I mean, look, the 
[01:29:00]  police, they say only  the police and  military should have  guns.  The police were  there.  They were in the  parking lot of the  movie theater for  crowd control.  They didn't have to  be called and drive to  the theater.  They were fucking on  scene and this  happened.  And here's the  other question.  How many people in  the theater, has it  come out yet, had  guns?  Actually, you're not  allowed to have a gun  in that theater.  There's a rule for  Cinemark theaters that  you're not allowed to  have guns. 
[01:29:30]  Well, if you had one,  it would be illegal.  And can they do  that, though?  Oh, yeah.  A university wasn't  allowed to do that  because your  constitutional right in  that state was more  important and overrode the  university's individual  policy.  How can they do  that?  It's all, it's  state by state.  State rights, as far  as gun laws and  restrictions go, it's  amazing the power they  have.  But the thing is, you  know, I don't see the  gunman paying attention  to a sign that says  you're not allowed to  bring a gun into the  theater. 
[01:30:00]  Well, obviously, yeah.  But that just assures  that he will be able to  open fire with impunity.  I was saying, and people  are cracking up, saying,  you know, you're an  asshole.  That is a microcosm of  an unarmed public.  That theater is a  complete little slice of  society of what it's like  when the public isn't  armed, but some type of  aggressor is. 
[01:30:30]  There's no recourse, and  aggressor wins.  It's beyond me.  So they should go the  other way and pass out  pistols before the show  Well, that's what other  people were saying.  Archie Bunker said that  on a flight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  And of course, the  hijacking.  The hijacking.  All right.  So I'll play that.  All right, go with the  Archie Bunker thing.  But that's ridiculous the  other way.  Right.  What I was trying to  explain is not everyone  is going to have a gun.  People aren't comfortable 
[01:31:00]  with them.  They don't like them.  Other people just don't  think about it at all.  Only a few people are  going to actually have  guns.  Because hopefully, and  I'm all for training, be  very good at what you do  and how you use a gun.  Be very responsible.  And in that situation, a  responsible gun owner that's  very familiar with his gun  and knows and is trained  will do a lot of good in a 
[01:31:30]  situation like that.  But how many people that  own legal guns are  responsible?  Well, you know what?  A lot of people own guns  and on a daily basis, if you  look at the actual numbers, a  lot of people aren't dying.  I just don't trust people  with guns.  Even when I walk down the  street and I see a cop with a  gun, I'm like, God, does he  really know how to use that?  But it's because, and I'm  not...  I'm being honest.  It's not offensive because  you don't trust yourself with a  gun.  Oh, no, of course not.  You don't like a lot of  people that don't trust  themselves or don't have an  understanding or are afraid 
[01:32:00]  of a gun.  A lot of people are afraid  to hold a gun and shoot  it.  It's a scary, kind of exciting  thing at the range.  I've seen first-time shooters  at the range, and they're  like, most people are  inherently afraid of a gun,  even if they're pointing it  just like themselves.  I'm not one of these guys  that wants all guns to go  away, by the way.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  I just...  There seems to be some  problems there.  Yeah.  I don't have a solution, by  the way.  Anthony's a responsible guy  with his guns.  Like, when you go over,  he'll hand him to you and 
[01:32:30]  go, I'll just shoot up in  the air.  Yeah.  I just have people  firing into my ceiling.  No, he's like, just go  outside and shoot, like,  over that house, but don't  shoot through the windows.  Yeah, yeah.  Things like that.  I'm very good with...  We play, like, adult army,  chasing each other with the  guns.  Yeah.  But you have to just use  the pew-pew sound, even  though you're firing a real  gun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He always tapes the  triggers, and just be  careful, because safety's  off.  Tape the trigger.  Well, we can all agree  that Alex Jones is an  asshole.  Well, we can.  At least in this room.  Yes, we can.  Because I know he's got  his fans out there.  I don't know what he's 
[01:33:00]  doing.  But the latest Alex Jones  audio is just...  Jesus, Alex.  Alex, what are you  doing?  He's a madman.  Yeah.  We'll explain next.  Now, I want to talk  about another thing that's  on everybody's mind  today, and that's your  stick-ups and your  skyjackings, which, if  that was up to me, I  could end the skyjackings  tomorrow.  All you got to do is  arm all your passengers.  And if he ain't got no  more superiority there, he  ain't going to dare to  pull out no rod. 
[01:33:30]  And then your airlines,  then they wouldn't have  to shake the passengers  on the ground no more.  They just pass out the  pistols at the beginning  of the trip, and they  pick them up again at the  end.  Case closed.  The Opie and Anthony  Show.  Sirius XM.

[01:34:30]  get poked in the eye.  She wears lace and she wears  flannel.  She watches football and the  Lifetime Channel.  What's that bulge under her  nightie?  It's just my hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Hermaphrodite.  Some things are white, some 
[01:35:00]  things are black.  Some girls wear makeup, mine  shaves her back.  She is still beautiful, she is  still fine.  It's too bad her package is  bigger than mine.  Yeah.  She looks like Cher, but she's  built like Sonny.  She loves Brad Pitt and finds  the Three Stooges funny.

[01:36:00]  The Opie and Anthony  Show.  All right.  We got an update on  the couple that were in the  movie theater.  They had a four-year-old and a  four-month-old.  People have a problem with that  right there.  I understand the four month old  I don't understand the four year old  being at the movie  because I know when my kid  especially was first born he just slept all the  fucking time so we were able to get  a few things done while he slept in public 
[01:36:30]  but whatever that's my point  of view on that  but then this guy  jumped off the balcony  left the kid behind because he thought  the kid might break his neck or whatever  it felt like he couldn't jump with the kid  he didn't even know where the kid was  he didn't know where his future wife was  with the four year old bad couple  we talked about him about an hour ago  because there's new listeners all the time  there's another piece of that story  Jimmy  and again the girlfriend I can understand 
[01:37:00]  because I would probably leave a girlfriend in the theater  I would be afraid and leave  it's more of a girlfriend situation though  they're technically like a married couple  they're not officially married but I mean they got a family together  he left his four year old and his four month old  and he just ran  he left his fucking  children  in the theater  right  now bringing them to the theater shows you that the judgment on this couple is kind of shitty  he left his children in the theater  and ran and jumped off the balcony and ran out  and  I guess left the wife 
[01:37:30]  with a girlfriend  and her four year old and a four month old  to fend for themselves  while a gunman shot  and then he gets in his truck and drives across the fucking  he left  and he said he was going to call 9-1-1  I don't think you need  and then he got the call  I don't think  he left  what you're going to be the  200th person to call 9-1-1  at that point you don't need to call 9-1-1  don't worry about it  you can assume that someone did that already  I hate this fucking guy  I hate him  he actually left the theater guy in his truck and drove 
[01:38:00]  yeah  this is why women get kids in custody fights  I had slight sympathy for him at first  zero  but  terrible guy  yeah  fucking  I had people go to go  you don't know how you'd react  you're right guys  I don't  but I will hope  that if I am fucking pumping out babies  I will at least react  by thinking to grab one  when I run out of a fucking theater  with someone shooting  especially a four month old  you could carry that shit like it's a football  it's a fucking kid  he just thought of himself 
[01:38:30]  and fuck her  and fuck the family  and then  let me see that picture  then he drove across the parking lot  which one  does he have  this guy has weird shit on his body  who  make this picture bigger  look at this guy  he has  this guy has fucking this weird  it's not acne  it's these weird bumps  all over his chest and arms  whoa what the fuck is that  like the elephant man  I think he's wet  oh is that water  okay  zoom in  I thought it was weird skin thing 
[01:39:00]  okay maybe you're right  is that water  I don't know  his beard looks wet  yeah  yeah he looks  wait a minute  he looks all wet  oh you're right  he's all wet  I thought there was something wrong  in his body  he's dripping  that's great  I'm so glad Sam saved me  an embarrassing tweet  but that was the gun we were looking at  oh by the way  the first 911 call  thank you for this info  Stephen Philly  one and a half minutes  so that guy  thinking he's going to call 911  as he's in his truck  fleeing the theater  he actually got into his truck 
[01:39:30]  he's lying  and started leaving  I was trying to help him out a little bit  when the show started  I'm out  I'm so out  he's terrible  I mean I was just thinking about the shock you're in  and I wonder if your whole brain gets rewired  when you're in a crazy situation like that  I mean even if you do run out  there's not a parent alive  that wouldn't try to save their kid  I understand that  yeah that one  you're wrong  there you go  that one wouldn't  there is a parent alive  and not even waiting out front  why did he get in his car and leave  it's like  he did everything bad 
[01:40:00]  I went home  I turned on the TV  I watched Seinfeld  I took a shower  yeah  I canceled all our credit cards  what a bum  yeah  I was making an office  out of the kids room  yeah she called  he was already repainting  who's this  oh honey  I thought you were massacred  with our children  oh my god  I didn't  oh  you were  it's funny  when you and the baby were there  I assumed you guys evaporated  to safety  yes 
[01:40:30]  when I jumped down  but then I started thinking  Ethan is not gonna have a father  but you left him  oh no I know  but that's why I'm saying  he wouldn't have a father  because I was gone  I was afraid he was there  he was probably home  on singles.com  as she's calling him  oh yeah  well you know  you have to move on  and she took a bullet  for the daughter  what  she got shot in the leg  yeah she got shot in the leg  so she takes a bullet  as he's driving away  so she did get shot  why did she say yes  to marrying this guy  I was telling these guys 
[01:41:00]  during the break  that women love to store shit  and it comes out  at the weirdest times  this is a huge one  she's got that stored  she's got the hydrogen bomb  oh my  their first fight  she's gonna bring it up  well at least I wasn't  the one that left the kids behind  you left  dies  right  it won't even be that though  there'll be an argument  and she'll say something like  well  I'm still here  like  what  what  what do you mean by that  surprised you haven't left yet  nothing  I  you know  why don't you just get in your truck 
[01:41:30]  and drive  that's what it'll be  it won't just be you left  it'll be that  yeah just jump in your truck  you know  and then as she turns away  she goes  you know  like you did at the theater  no  it'll be this  no it's more like  like you usually do  you know  and they'll be arguing  he'll be going  I'm leaving  well why should not be any different  oh yes  yes  but here's the thing I don't get  if the guy comes in on the ground floor  they're in the balcony  he's in a safe spot  how does  how does she get shot up there 
[01:42:00]  like where was  I'm trying to think  I don't think this is a balcony  balcony thing  I  I think  you know how the sides of the theater  you have the  that entranceway  and it's kind of a  little  like walkway  and then you  you can almost jump off the side  of the theater  seats  oh I know what you're talking about  like there's the rail  when you're walking up  in the seats  and  oh like basically  they might have been sitting  over the entrance to the door  right  that rail  why are they calling it a balcony  that's stupid  well I'm not sure 
[01:42:30]  if that's the case  that makes sense  he probably jumped down  and ran to safety  and as she was trying to get out  she got shot  yeah that's like  kind of what  I was thinking  he jumped over the side  it sounds like  yeah  that angle side  that could either be  two feet  or 15  or 15 feet  depending on how far  up in the theater you are  yeah exactly  what a fucking twat  that changes everything  I'm thinking it's a balcony  he's in a safe spot  more or less  yeah  but it sounds like  no one was really  in a safe spot  in that theater  no that's true too  but  why are they calling it a balcony 
[01:43:00]  I understand  now it's those  where the first like  ten rows are almost like  regular like seating  and then you got the big rail  yeah the rail  and you gotta walk up  and then all those seats  go up nice  when no one's head  gets in the way  and then there's  kind of a drop off  over the railing  yeah that's  that's not a balcony  situation  no  I'm thinking old school  balcony  yeah yeah  where you get to like  you know  yeah what is he  fucking  drop soda on the people  below  spit and make believe  you're coming on the people  yeah exactly  throw some Juergens  I'm the only one  that did that  what happened  Juergens dish soap 
[01:43:30]  on people  yeah you know  groan as you do it  but now we're learning  that the guy drove  across the parking lot  I'm reading another quote  hoping for the best  here's how you know  where his head is  he says  I'm thinking  he's crying  and they're going  to come get me  what  wait  who's gonna come  get you  the shooter  wait he heard  the kid crying  he's like  he's saying  he's crying  and they're going  to come get me  oh so he thought  the crying kid  was gonna draw  the gunman  he ran away 
[01:44:00]  from his crying baby  because he thought  that  so this  this cocksucker  thinks  so what does he think  that the gunman  is gonna shoot him  so he'll save his son  by leaving the source  of the noise  what a piece  of shit  Hawkeye's watching him  suffocate a chicken  this shit's gonna  in the back of the bus  this shit's gonna come out  this shit's gonna come out  in their next argument  oh boy  this marriage is doomed  it's hard to find stuff online 
[01:44:30]  because when you google  his name  it's just blog after blog  talking about what a coward  what a coward  oh they are  this guy  he's getting killed  on the internet  this guy wishes  he would have been shot  at this point  every video  every interview of them  on youtube  is just filled with comments  about what a coward  oh man  this guy is  oh boy  just the cowardly  wow  it's hard to defend  it's hard to defend  what a bag of shit  this guy is  a bag of shit  he was in his car 
[01:45:00]  he wasn't even  at the theater  at that point  he went from  being in the theater  with the gunfire  and his children  and his fucking girlfriend  to driving in his car  wait let's have  an open mind though  alright  we've all been  at a sporting event  you want to get out  of there early  probably avoiding the rush  I'm assuming there's  a lot of commotion  there's gonna be  a lot of people  trying to get in  their cars  and get out of there  that's true  he's going for  the early exit  to avoid the traffic  maybe he was looking  for another theater  to watch the movie in 
[01:45:30]  he was getting caught up  in it  well it just started  20 minutes ago  yeah yeah  I can just figure out  the story  imagine if they found him  in another theater  picking up where  that movie left off  you know I'm the only one  brave enough to go  into a theater again  just trying to talk  about how brave he is  you know it's dangerous  on the streets  I was in a car  what?  without a seatbelt on  and it's not like  he just went to his car  and just sat in his car  and waited  no  he drove away  he could not get  further away  faster  I think we made 
[01:46:00]  our point  but this is how  this shit will come out  we got Dan in PA  go ahead Dan  hey guys  just to remind me  of the story  when I was maybe  17, 18 years old  I'm with my now wife  then girlfriend  we're on the beach  she's laying there  she's got her top undone  laying on her stomach  sunbathing  and Gus the Wing  comes, picks up  a beach umbrella  starts rolling at tourists  I look up  my first reaction  is I jump the hell  out of the way  leave her there  and this is her luckily  and 10 years from now 
[01:46:30]  still when we're in a fight  she still brings up  how I jumped out of the way  of the beach umbrella  umbrella  oh my god  a beach umbrella  imagine gunfire  and this guy's fucked  I would just go  you know what  we shouldn't get married  he should cut his losses  it's going to get ugly  how did she say yes  well she's in shock  get out of there  yeah you think that's it  yeah of course  I think that  plus it is also  the only father of her kids  and it's like  she's in a decision  right now  now do I end this  relationship  and be a single mother 
[01:47:00]  or do I just marry  this pansy  and hope we're never  in another shooting  right  this video that Sam  has up  has 423 dislikes  it's just an interview  of them  oh shit  and what are the comments  this one is my favorite  bitch please  this fool threw his baby  on the floor  ran out of the theater  hopped in his vehicle  started the ignition  and drove away  keep going  meanwhile a teenage boy  proved himself  more of a man  than this roars idiot 
[01:47:30]  by taking a bullet  while protecting the family  that roars left behind  like garbage  by the sky  then the coward roars  just drove around  until his girlfriend  called his dumb ass  and let him know  what the danger was over  what's disgusting is  you defend in such  repressible conduct  wow  reprehensible  yeah  this one  I'm getting this one  in too  it says  as he slid down  off his chair  to hide  his baby's head  got caught between 
[01:48:00]  the seats in front of him  and started crying  like his baby's head  got stuck in between  the seats  this guy  is a piece of garbage  wow  he just  I'm surprised  he didn't throw the kid  to the gunman  and go here  here's what you're looking for  what a fucking bum  what a bum  can you fucking believe  that this guy  is that cowardly 
[01:48:30]  and that he's accepting  interview requests  yeah  just hide  hide in shame  what the fuck  do you think  you're doing  I'll talk about it again  sure  oh man  that's funny  and the girlfriend  took a bullet  yeah  she took a bullet  protecting her daughter  one YouTube user  is asking a good question  this dude  drops his baby  and leaves his  four year old  and girlfriend  goes to his car  drives away  and calls her  from his cell phone 
[01:49:00]  did he leave a voicemail  hey baby  you shot  this guy stinks  fucking great  and you know what  not only did he leave  but he takes the vehicle  so like  even if they do  get out  they get out  what are they gonna do  yeah  yeah  they just  he  is  he is just an example  when you see  like there are  genuine acts  of heroism 
[01:49:30]  that happen  stories coming out  of guys that did  protect their girlfriends  protected colleagues  and other guys  that were  I guess  one of the navy guys  protected another one  and  stories like that  are amazing  it just shows  what people can do  under those circumstances  as far as  you know  really coming to the table  on the other end  of the spectrum  this also shows  how fucking people react  with utter  incomplete cowardice  and  nothing but  self preservation 
[01:50:00]  on their minds  but how dumb  is he really  human nature  he's still breathing  that's debatable  you're absolutely right  I'm just fucking around  no but you're right  because both of them  are basic human nature  I mean  but  but what dictates  what is what  you know  like what makes  somebody  take the bullet  for another person  and what makes  somebody  fucking  pass his kids  down fucking range  and run out  and get in a car  he can't get far  enough away  that's just by leaving  that's the exact moment  when you find out 
[01:50:30]  whether a person  is wired to be  a good person  or a bad person  right  that's the difference  or a person  that could be  depended upon  or a person  that's just  a lump of shit  and meanwhile  if you're just  hanging out  without any  adverse circumstances  like this happening  you'd never know  like this guy  might have  you know  to his friends  he's like  he's a great guy  very dependable  yeah yeah  he drove me to work  a few months  when I didn't have a car  he was there on time  every day  you could really  depend on him  and then  you know  when it reaches a point  he is  all about himself 
[01:51:00]  and of course  the football fans  are chiming in  on YouTube too  typical Broncos fan  ducks out like a bitch  when shit goes sour  oh man  you guys want  I was just going to say  somebody uploaded  Jamie Rourke's  exclusive footage  of him leaving the scene  yeah  can you guess  I bet  it's  George Costanza  when he saw smoke  that's why I love  the internet  I know that there's  people just like me  yes 
[01:51:30]  this guy writes  what a fag  he let some kid  take a bullet for him  and got two people killed  he even interviews  like some super vag  super vag  yeah this guy  is never  ever going to  live this down  no  he has to walk around  with that fucking shame  you think he's ashamed  or is he too dumb  right now  no he's got  there's no one  that isn't going  to know  that they fucking  but I'll tell you  right now  he's right in that  thing now  it all is so fresh 
[01:52:00]  like this joker  jerk off  living his fantasy  this hasn't sunk in yet  even the shooter  is still in shock  that he did it  yeah  this guy  this fucking  Jamie Rourke's guy  is still thinking  that his argument  is believable  and his lie  is believable  and his bullshit  is believable  yeah  do you guys know  YOLO  yes  the concept of YOLO  you only live once  this kind of  YouTube commenter  said Jamie Rourke  pretty much said  YOLO to his family  and started running 
[01:52:30]  YOLO  YOLO  YOLO  as he's fucking  running down the hallway  and running to his vehicle  screw it up  really  there's not a single person  that isn't just  who's supporting this guy  is anyone supporting this guy  um  if I guess  she might have thought  like God  if I don't fucking  say yes to this proposal  he will just fucking  well he probably  wouldn't kill himself  we've seen his  self preservation  she doesn't even know  what she's doing either  she's in shock as well 
[01:53:00]  it's the father of kids  that are alive  it hasn't sunk in  I think when she has time  to really think about this  she's gonna be bothered  big time by this  she's gonna say one day  baby  can I ask you something  you think it'll be  a quiet night  like in bed  and it's like  um  baby  yeah  I told you that  can I  can I ask you something  yeah sweetie  go ahead  what  what's up  um  that day in the theater  yeah  remember that day 
[01:53:30]  yeah  oh my god  baby it's so good  that we're  we're all here and together  I thank  I thank God every day  yeah me too  um  but uh  what  what were you thinking  when you left us there  it's always gonna come up  were you threw the baby  between the seats  and his head got stuck  and the crying child  like  and you just left us there  the baby was crying  and he  that's the noise  that made him run away  because he was afraid  that crying baby  was going to attract 
[01:54:00]  he reacted to a crying baby  the way I do  he ran  let me ask you guys this  I know now in my life  I would uh  I would  I would die for my wife  and my son  who would you die for  if you're in that theater  you really gotta think about  though  like you could just say  well I'd die for that  but I think an honest answer  would be  you wouldn't die for anyone  which would be  which would be fair  obviously  how far would you go  with your heroism  that's pretty fucked up 
[01:54:30]  I've had relationships  in the past  would you sacrifice  your own life  for a complete stranger  no way  yeah  I'm not brave enough  yeah  I can only speculate  that I would  if I had a child  because I know  that nature  gives us that  incredibly strong instinct  to protect your own young  I'm here to tell you  that's one realization  you do have  you're like  holy fuck  it's like a light bulb  you're like  wait a minute  I know I would die  for my kid  but I don't think  okay here's what it is  I don't think a lot of people  go into a situation  of heroics thinking 
[01:55:00]  okay I'm gonna die  doing this  I think most of them  go into it thinking  wow that person  really needs help  I'm gonna help them  I know this is dangerous  but I hope nothing happens  like it's not that  jump in front of the gun  as the bullets  whizzing towards someone  thing  but some of these guys  are absolutely wired  to the point  where they would do that  it's a helping thing  because there's an instinct  I know that  for humans to help  also  if that instinct  is strong  then you help  I think there's still 
[01:55:30]  the self preservation  aspect of it  thinking  I hope I'm able  to get through this  right  and not get killed  then there's the  complete other end  where you leave  your crying child  and family  jump in a vehicle  and drive far away  in this case  you gotta realize  my life is pretty much over  and I don't think  you could  I got a lot of shit  I gotta try to do here  yeah  you know I've  you know I had  kind of an open mind  at the beginning of the show  yeah now it's just  forget about it  no yeah it's ridiculous  I think anybody  is capable 
[01:56:00]  of risking their life  for other people  in this right situation  I don't think you know  if you could or would do it  unless that situation  presents itself  like if you're in that theater  you know Jimmy  you're saying  I wouldn't do anything  in that situation  you look over  you see somebody  that might need help  you might get this  just instinctual thing  to help somebody  or you know  I could drag this person  a little bit this way  to get them out of  and if you're killed  doing it  you'd be large  as a fucking hero  we're talking about guys 
[01:56:30]  that are  that absolutely jumped  in front of bolts  yeah  and for  were they complete strangers  some were girlfriends  right  yeah  we had a little  three guys  that died for their girlfriends  yeah  they were for their girlfriends  I wouldn't be one of them  imagine those girls  now with the next boyfriend  yeah  that's a tough act  to follow  because having a wife  is different than a girlfriend  so I'm thinking back  to some of my exes  you forgot my fucking  birthday huh  yeah  you know my other boyfriend  let me tell you what he did  what he did for me 
[01:57:00]  exactly  roses huh  that's nice  yeah that's really nice  did I tell you what  my other boyfriend did  you know  the only reason I'm dating you  is because you saved my life  and he's no longer on earth  could you drive me to the cemetery  so I could you know  pay tribute to the man  that saved my life  right  do you think the relationship  between Jamie Roars  and his son  is going to be fragmented  once he finds out  what he did  yeah that's going to be  there is one person  who's on his side  on the YouTube comment  oh  who's that  J-R  but they're using 
[01:57:30]  good logic  they're saying  everyone needs to  shut the fuck up  it was fate  if he would have  went back  or stayed  he could have been  dead right now  and his kid  would not have a father  yeah  this was fate  fate  right  the day fate  stepped in  yeah  on the twilight zone  it was uh  not  it was not fate  it was feet  and he beat them  this is not a case  of me being  saying a guy  should have  protected his girl 
[01:58:00]  he left  his fucking  crying infant  in a theater  to protect himself  he stinks  they're going to get  into a fight one day  and she's going to say  why don't you ask  your father  what he did to you  when you were four  oh no  oh the kid will know  oh yeah  the kid will know  oh yeah  oh yeah  especially with the internet  this doesn't go away  oh no  daddy tell me  what happened  at the movie theater  yeah  well son  mom says you ran out  like it was a  Bugs Bunny cartoon  mommy said we were 
[01:58:30]  left all alone  and you left in the car  how come mommy  got shot while you  was driving around  listening to the radio  what was you doing  while mommy  how come there was  a negro helping mommy  while you was driving  around listening to  the radio  daddy  why didn't you hear me  crying while my  head was stuck  in the movie seat  why did you put my  head in between  the chairs  why did you fall  down on me  daddy why didn't  you want to crush  me but you

[02:06:00]  anthony alex jones  has a very good  take on the  batman shooting  yeah  ladies and  gentlemen alex jones  here with breaking  news i can't do  this today  breaking news  sounds uh how  many listeners does  this guy have a lot  right yeah  infowars.com  infowars  let me tell you  oh boy  here we go  enjoy the ride  people  yeah  i wish it 
[02:06:30]  wasn't the case  but all the  earmarks all the  evidence points  towards this being  a staged event  all the evidence  all the earmarks  we're a kooky  society we really  are fucking  nuts  how does it  as a whole  how does it  point to this  being some kind  of a staged  event  less scary  than the  randomness  right  of this  that it was  something planned  is for some  reason less  helpless and  frightening feeling  but i think  alex jones is  now just in 
[02:07:00]  great he just  believes all this  everything  he's got to do  it i like i  like it is at  any point does he  go and they  were told to  stand down  well let's  that guy jumped  down he was  told to jump  down  he might use  stand down  yeah  he definitely  will say  a conspiracy  psyops  yeah  he's either  go psyops  or black  ops  what else  will he say  i swear we  haven't heard  this clip  what else  will he say  here  well the police  were told to  stand down  and wait  because they  were there  you're going  to tell me  that he's 
[02:07:30]  going to do  a massacre  while the  police are  there  and they're  not going  to get to  him  someone open  that door  which by  nature makes  it a conspiracy  a conspiracy  sure  marks all  the evidence  points towards  this being a  staged event  the tragic  attack at  the midnight  showing of  the new  batman movie  the dark  night rises  you have the  united nations  treaty where  they only need  a few senators 
[02:08:00]  who are on the  fence to vote  for it that  obama says he's  going to sign  in the next week  and a half  we have that  treaty in  trouble on  a razor's  edge and then  magically this  happens and  within hours  all the major  media the  democrats they  come out and  say the  new york  times  bloomberg  all of them  it's time  to restrict  guns and  that's what  the unidere  treaty clearly  states is that  it allows  registration and  then confiscation  that's what fast  and furious was  about so let me  ask you this  question if they  would stage  fast and furious 
[02:08:30]  if they would  ship up to  twenty thousand  guns in a  hangar next to  mexico and  then the memos  came out in  cbs news to  blame the  second amendment  would they  stage this  there have  been many  staged events  where you  get a  patsy  drug them  up  usually it's  somebody in  the government  or university  thought i had  that word  patsy would  have been a  good word to  say that he  was going to  say  so what's  happening here  because of  some treaty  he thinks  that there  was a treaty  going to be  signed so  they sent 
[02:09:00]  in this  guy to  do the  shootings and  everybody's  anti-gun  yeah there's  a lot of  controversy with  this united  nations treaty  that's supposed  to be signed  it's some  type of  anti-fucking  gun importation  and registration  there's a lot  of shit on  there that a  lot of people  here don't  like and it  is controversial  so he's  saying that  to soften  up the  old beaches  you do  this and  it brings 
[02:09:30]  everybody on  the side  of the  treaty  it's where  you get a  patsy  drug them  up  usually it's  somebody in  a government  or university  program  like theodore  kaczynski  who was in  mk ultra  the unabomber  that's actually  la times  associated  press but  nobody seems  to know it  and then you  set them up  later down  the road  right  and that's  exactly what's  happening here  with the  loffner case  in arizona  and now  this new  one in  colorado  they follow  the complete  mo and we're  going to go 
[02:10:00]  over some  of that  but the big  telltale sign  is not just  the treaty  coming up  in a week  and a half  or this  being near  the globalist  command center  the alternate  u.s.  capital  there under  denver  and then  close by  in colorado  springs  the real  telltale  is that they  were ready  with the  propaganda  right on  time for  this  and associated  it with  the big  movie  now what you  do is you  have your  black op operator  coming in a  mask  they do  the killing  then you  either kill  or drug  a patsy  who's waiting  with amnesics  or other  chemicals  who will 
[02:10:30]  then take  the blame  and it's  very easy  to do this  with enough  PCP LSD  wait so he  didn't even  do it  so he  didn't even  do it  oh okay  he didn't do it  there was a guy  because he's  wearing the  mask  now no one  could say  what he  looked like  and there's  that guy  and he does  the shooting  then he leaves  he's the  black ops guy  and goes off  in one of these  silent helicopters  or something  and then  you dump  this motherfucker  all drugged up  after you give  him the  amnesiac  and then 
[02:11:00]  you dump  him there  and he's  the patsy  like  oh my god  what did I do  yes that's  what you do  and the guy's  mother  says you got  the right guy  but that's  just a mistake  well no she  could be in  on it  oh she is  that's right  she's part  of the government  patsy  no she's part  of the black  ops  black ops  right  alright  I'm with him  I'm with him  I'm with him  I'm kind of  in so far  kind of what I  thought  I'm kind of  in  Gulf of Tonkin 
[02:11:30]  you think that'll  come up  let's hope so  I hope so  we've seen this  over and over  again  Hitler  Lee Harvey Oswald  Lee Harvey Oswald  I'm saying it  right now  damn it  I'm going to say  Oswald  he's going to say  Oswald  so we've seen  this over and  over again  Hitler attacked  his own military  base  at Glywitz  on the edge  of Poland  in 39  to blame Poland  for it  dressed up people  in Polish outfits  from the local  concentration camp  that they shot up  this is done  over and over again  there's been cases  where they've had  these massacres 
[02:12:00]  at schools  over in Russia  and the security  services pull out  and they kill  the patsy  and arrest  one drug guy  they have drugs  like in the case  of Sirhan Sirhan  where the LAPD  shit  what what  with the shooting  of RFK  that his gun  didn't do it  he hadn't shot him  and it was another  caliber from somebody  behind him  that's what the  coroner said  they have drugs  now is that true  Ant  because he does  say a lot of  stuff where now  you have to go  and research  I think it's utter  nonsense  so basically  there was all  those people  in the ambassador 
[02:12:30]  hotel in the kitchen  they all saw  Sirhan Sirhan do it  yes  but it was a guy  behind him  but it was a patsy  yeah  a guy behind him  yeah  sure  meanwhile  the cameras rolling  they didn't catch  the assassination  but that's what  you would do  yep  sure  that's what the  coroner said  they have drugs  like scopolamine  that they've known  about for hundreds  of years  known as the devil's  breath  you've heard of this  where they blow it  on you  if they blow it  on you  it will make you  for 24 hours 
[02:13:00]  you have total  control  you can drive a car  or anything  you're not inebriated  except that you  have no free will  if they say stick  that would be  the greatest  date rape drug  ever  please  why isn't this  shit out  you can still  fuck and suck  and eat an ass  can we get that  on the black market  please  oh that sounds  great  I would love  that they could  blow it on you  and you just  fucking  you're doing  you're going  about your business  but then  you have no free will 
[02:13:30]  hey suck my dick  alright  and then  you're getting  your dick sucked  did anyone  blow anything  on you today  how would you know  how would you know  you don't know  because you lose  Alex Jones might be right  free will  we might have all  got blown today  we don't even know it  wow  blowing on  inebriated  except that you  have no free will  if they say stick  your hand in a blender  you do it  if they say hack  your baby up  with a hatchet  they say jump  off the stairs  and leave your baby  behind and your  girlfriend and 
[02:14:00]  drive away in a car  you do it  come on  if they tell you  to be a conspiracy  nut on the radio  you do it  you do it  you do it  the suspect is  refusing to cooperate  before his court  appears  shoot him in the  fucking head  please  break his legs  just break his leg  alright  pack your baby up  with a hatchet  they do it  they say  well she was trying  to burn the hotel  down  yes 
[02:14:30]  she had to be  corrected  yes  one of  one of the hotel  monsters blew  something in my face  and I chopped him  you chopped him  into little bits  didn't you  oh Alex  Alex  Alex  oh my god  Alex  oh boy  little Alex  they do it  they say  you know  jump off a cliff  you do it  this is just  some of the  old type drugs  directly from a plant  directly from a flower  that they have  so that's what  mind control is  a lot of 
[02:15:00]  mind control  and you look at how  he supposedly got through  a steel reinforced door  where they're set  into the wall  where you can't  before he gets to  the steel door  we got people going  hey this drug  exists  let's go to  Justin in Jersey  Justin  hey how's it going  hey man  you know  the only reason  I know about this  thing is I watched  a documentary  a couple years ago  about it  I believe it's in  Columbia  was it on  Info Wars  documentary  yeah where was it 
[02:15:30]  oh man  this guy  I think this guy  is completely  full of shit  yes of course  he is  yeah this stuff  it's actually  pretty dangerous  you know  it's basically  made of this  seed pod  that grows  on a tree  and they plant  these trees  along the street  man  anybody can go  and pick  themselves off  it's kind of  difficult to make  but you know  there are cases  where you know  gang members  will basically  they'll hire  a prostitute  or something 
[02:16:00]  they'll give them  some of this drug  they'll walk up  to somebody  on the street  you know  start talking  to them all night  get really close  blow it in their face  and then they go  and you know  wipe out  their bank accounts  and fucking  steal everything  out of their  apartments and shit  I mean  it's pretty bad  and then when  you know  the person  comes out of it  later on  they're like  oh what the fuck  just happened  you know  they have no  memory of anything  well now  I got a text  from Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  yeah  you blow it  on someone's 
[02:16:30]  tumescent erection  you snort it off  their tumescent erection  and if it's going  to fall  you put it  along the ridge  this way  you can tongue  the hole  while you're  snorting it off  their tumescent  genitals  you gotta tongue  the pre-cum  to keep the drug  from getting  all over it  you don't have  to swallow  you can always  spit it out  but you gotta  you gotta breathe 
[02:17:00]  it in  breathe it in  spores  I love the fact  that he's listening  to this as you  do it  yeah of course  he is  as I talk  about him  snorting  with his  mustache  I talk about  him snorting  this drug  off the  underside  of a  cockroach  Dr. Steve  says  we use  scopolamine  which is the  drug  scopolamine  every day  in the hospital  it is sold  to people  for seasickness 
[02:17:30]  on cruise  ships  so basically  dramamine  made this  man do it  little  dramamine  right  if you blow  dramamine  into a guy's  face  Dr. Steve  and Alex  should do a  show together  oh would that  be great  if you blew  smoke  in this guy's  face  yeah scopolamine  helps you  from  vomiting  where they're  set into  the wall  where you  can't get  out  ok this is  the door  let me go  back  yeah scoff  him and  somebody  just left  he left  it open  yeah that 
[02:18:00]  he went  out to  make a  phone call  which we've  all done  every single  one of us  have opened  up one of  those exit  doors  not exactly  a bank  vault  pretty easy  to do  this is  declassified  and you  look at how  he supposedly  got through  a steel  reinforced  door  where they're  set into  the wall  where you  can't get  out  because it  closes into  the wall  it only  opens out  he supposedly  kicked this  down  and they  tried to  hold it  shut  but he  got through  that's in  the associated  practice  who tried  to hold it 
[02:18:30]  shut  and why  wouldn't you  acknowledge  that it's  very possible  just to  make sure  it doesn't  close behind  you  dude he  has to do  a four hour  show every  day  it's just  exhausting  it really  is  exhausting  the way  he lays  it out  in that  scenario  sure that  sounds  impossible  to do  but that's  not how  it went  down  no it  was opened  only opens  out  he supposedly  kicked this  down  and they  tried to  hold it  shut  but he  got through  that's in  the associated  press  folks this 
[02:19:00]  is totally  staged  this is  totally  staged  and even  if he  wasn't  mind  controlled  himself  directly  by government  which I  believe the  evidence is  overwhelming  and most  people do  as well  you trust  your gut  on this  and history  these programs  do exist  this has all  the earmarks  earmarks  most people do  as well  I don't know  one person  he's a great  corny  he's an amazing  corny  I'll give him  that much  it's not  overwhelming  if there's  any doubt  overwhelming evidence 
[02:19:30]  overwhelming  and he throws  shit out  there  that's in  the AP  that's in  the LA  and now  you have  to do  all your  own research  to see if  he's even  telling the  truth  where did  it say  that people  tried to  hold the  door closed  I've never  heard that  I have not  can you look  that up  not once  I haven't  heard that  once  we heard  that he  made an  excuse why  he had to  get out  of the  theater  right  they're still  going with  that  and actually  they saw  someone leave  that way  so if you're  leaving that way  and you know  you want to  come back in 
[02:20:00]  and how  about the  overwhelming  evidence that  the guy  was planning  this for  months  and what's  the deal  with his  apartment  and the  fact that  he ordered  this stuff  and there's  a record  that for  months  he was  getting  on  the  patsy  part  he's  the  patsy  and you  know  even though  he was  booby  trapped  I'm sure  you know  the black  ops guys  got in  there to  clean up  all the  shit  that would  make them  look bad  and leave  behind only  the stuff  that would  make the  patsy  look bad  I'm sure  I'm sure  he thinks 
[02:20:30]  that the  reason  they took  24 hours  before they  went into  the apartment  was that  the other  black ops  guys  were in  there  of course  that's  what  happened  even the  news camera  was watching  them  but you know  what guys  he says it  here  you're all  being programmed  the television  itself and these  messages and things  are programming  people and it's  been proven to lead  to violence  that's why the  copycats  they're stationing  police all over  the place  at these movie  theaters in  New York  and other areas  because they think  copycats may  attack  that's the power  of a movie  and that's the  power of this  guy doing it 
[02:21:00]  they've just  got to stage  one real event  and it may  start a bunch  of copycats  and that brings  us to this  point  now they're  talking about  they talked  about this  years ago  but now  they want  TSA style  groping at  malls, movie  theaters, grocery  stores  turning everything  into a giant  prison  this reports  up at  prisonplanet.com  coming next  prisonplanet.com  you gotta believe  what's on prison  you're right  he is a good  carny  he's an amazing  carny  he really is  the best at it  and he has to do it  because he has  four hours to kill  what's he gonna do  just talk about 
[02:21:30]  how sad it was  he has to  make it interesting  this elixir  cures diphtheria  and baldness  please buy it  and it's good  for his business  he makes a lot  of money off  conspiracy shit  so I wonder  if you sat down  and had a few  drinks with this  guy if he would  say yeah of course  I don't believe  half this shit  of course I don't  this reports  up at  prisonplanet.com  coming next  TSA  at the movie theater  national association  of theater owners  reviewing security  procedures  the one in telegraph  got it right  and said basically 
[02:22:00]  a death obsessed  culture  not guns  is to blame  for batman shootings  we wrote our own  article  along those lines  again people reported  that other men  were inside there  that looked like  police  so that's why  they didn't tackle him  because it was  the authority figure  he was dressed like  the good guys  that wear black  uniforms and masks  basically dressed up  like Bane  notice Bane  basically dresses  like our cops  but he's supposedly  the bad guy  this is all  man  I don't think  Bane was dressed  like that  he is just going  off 
[02:22:30]  Bane wasn't dressed  like a cop  I don't sleep  so well batman  I've got apnea  it's apnea man  there's a crying  baby  quick stick his  head between  two chairs  and jump down  to safety  leave the baby  but see  throw stuff out  there  it's completely  wrong  Bane wasn't  dressed like a  cop in the movie  no  he just says  that's why  they didn't tackle him 
[02:23:00]  because it was  the authority figure  he was dressed  like the good guys  that were  I think  sorry I keep  stopping  but this is  what you gotta  do with Alex  Jones  and when we've  had him on the  phone  this is what  we do  and he messes  him up  and next thing  you know  he goes  I just woke  up  bad phone  connection  I don't  know  he is  just hung up  on us  at times  because he  panics  yeah  the reason  they didn't  tackle him  was how  are you gonna  tackle the  guy  as fucking  rounds are  coming out  you're in shock  and he's  shooting you  right  you're running  right  it would be  very nice 
[02:23:30]  if there was  this united  front where  people would  know to  just rush  anyone that's  doing that  right  I mean  again  there's that  thing  where  am I gonna  be the one  that gets  hit  yeah  and beat  him  I mean  you get  even six  people  just rushing  at him  at one  time  to just  fucking  pummel  him  it would  work  but we  don't have  that mentality  well your  first instinct  is get the  fuck out of  there  you might  be looking  around  going well  wait I gotta  save this  person before  I get the  fuck out  of here  or if 
[02:24:00]  you're in  an area  where you  know you're  safe for  the time  being  maybe you're  thinking for  a split  second  can I  make a  run  for this  guy  yeah  yeah  yeah  I know  you're in  shock  but it's not  your first  thought  I know  it's not  your first  thought  no no  your first  thought is  to preserve  your own  fucking life  right  that look  like police  so that's  why they  didn't tackle  him  because it  was the  authority  figure  he was  dressed like  the good  guys that  wear black  uniforms and  masks  basically  dressed up  like Bane  notice Bane  basically dresses  like our  cops  but he  doesn't  this is all 
[02:24:30]  massive  programming  and we  cannot let  them use  this to  take our  second  amendment  Kurt  Nimmo wrote  a great  article at  infowars.com  showing the  statistics  that it  is one of  the rarest  ways to  die  is from  a mass  shooting  it's almost  as rare  as shark  bites  shark bites  are even  more rare  the point  is don't  give up  your liberties  because of  this phantom  idea  go watch  my review  that came  out a month  ago  where I  talked about  this being  false flag  against the  psyche  to create 
[02:25:00]  this perception  of terrorism  being everywhere  and now  they've  actually  ignited  this  again folks  that's a lot  of the points  I covered a lot  of it on the  radio today  we'll cover it  on the nightly  news tonight  please tell me  what you think  below here on  the website  and at youtube  and we'll just  continue to  collate data  make your own  videos your own  articles about  angles that  you see  the point is  mind control  is real  they staged  fast and furious  before  this is perfect  timing  we'd be  idiots  not to  look at this  as a staged  self-inflicted 
[02:25:30]  wound  false flag  inside job  so there you  go with  Alex Jones  they're taking  away all  Penn State  football wins  from 98  to 2011  they're altering  all the old  records  that's just  dumb  turn out  no longer  winningest  coach ever  what are you  doing  that's just  stupid  how are you  vacating  how are you  hurting all  of those 
[02:26:00]  students that  played for him  by doing  paternal  is a piece  of garbage  right  and the  university  is garbage  but how are  you taking  away all  those wins  and altering  record  how the fuck  are you doing  that  honestly that's  completely stupid  not a fan of  paternal  trust me  in the football  program  but that's  that's just  ridiculous  let's hear this  are they actually  banned from  wow  Penn State  banned from  bowl games  say  for four  years  for four  years  involves  tragic  and tragically  unnecessary  circumstances 
[02:26:30]  one of the  grave dangers  stemming from  our love of  sports  is that the  sports themselves  can become  too big to  fail  indeed  too big to  even challenge  the result  can be an  erosion of  academic values  that are replaced  by the value  of hero worship  and winning  at all costs  all involved  in intercollegiate  athletics  must be watchful  that programs  and individuals  do not  overwhelm  the values  of higher  education 
[02:27:00]  in the Penn  State case  the results  were perverse  and unconscionable  no price  the NCAA  can levy  will repair  the grievous  damage  inflicted by  Jerry Sandusky  on his victims  wow  however we can  make clear  that the culture  actions  and inactions  that allowed  them to be  victimized  will not be  tolerated  in collegiate  athletics  I'd be happy  to take your  question  this guy is 
[02:27:30]  fucking  after that  explanation  I completely  agree  win at all  costs  which we've  said on this  show many  times  Harold Hayes  KDK  Pittsburgh  so you take  all their  fucking  wins  yesterday  calling the  free report  pretty much  an indictment  a charging  document  not necessarily  a verdict  don't you  usually  conduct  your own  investigation  and why  did you  rely so  heavily  on the  free report  the  free report  as well  as the  data that 
[02:28:00]  came out  of the  criminal  trial  provided  extensive  information  in this  case  the report  has been  accepted  by the  university  itself  it was  the result  of more  than 450  individual  interviews  an examination  of more  than 3  million  emails  and other  documents  that's it  goodbye  goodbye  old man  but what  they're doing  is saving  the Penn State  University  for the future  this will  save Penn State  next question  Mark Dennis 
[02:28:30]  dot cbs  sports dot com  does this  as speculated  open up  some sort  of Pandora's  box  for future  cases  or is this  unique  in and of  itself  this case  is obviously  incredibly  unprecedented  in every  aspect of  it  as are  these  actions  that we're  taking  today  and we  do not  see them  as opening  Pandora's  box at all  this is a  very distinct  and very  unique  circumstance  Mark  Pat 40 
[02:29:00]  from Yahoo  Sports  how much  communication  have you  had with  Penn State  about this  and do you  expect them  to appeal  in any way  we have  informed  Penn State  of the  findings  the adoption  of the  findings  coming from  the free  report  and also  of our  penalties  the one  that cost  something  fucking  guy  you have  unconsent  what are  we are  all the  players  could transfer  without  you know  penalties  they're going  to lose  10 scholarships  a year  wow  yeah this 
[02:29:30]  football  program  is  for the  next four  years  they lose  10  scholarships  a year  and  everyone  that's  in the  program  could  transfer  without  a  penalty  wait  what about  the play  no bowl  games  60 million  dollar fine  we certainly  hope  and I know  President  Ray and the  executive committee  hope  that the  fine that's  being imposed  will allow  who's going to  want to play  on that  that's what  I'm saying  they're severely  hurting the  football program  but they're not  killing it 
[02:30:00]  but it's going to  take a long time  to come back  from this  you're losing  scholarships  you've got  players out there  that will never  go to Penn State  first of all  you can't play  in ball games  for four years  you're not  going to be able  to shine  no one's going  to want to  play on that  team  anybody worth  anything  is not going  to want  to go to  Penn State  easily the  next four  years  so that clears  out the  entire student  body  so then they're  thinking after  four years  it'll be fresh  people  and we can  maybe start  rebuilding from  there  I don't disagree  with taking 
[02:30:30]  the wins away  now that I  think about it  because I mean  Paterno knew  all this shit  was going down  somewhere in  98 and it  was a win at  all costs  thing  so what  they're doing  is they're  saying all  of your wins  are being  taken away  have been  tainted  because you  knew all  this shit  was going  on  I don't  disagree  with it  now that I  think about it  if the  controversy  would have  come out  during one  of those  seasons  perhaps they  wouldn't have  won  they wouldn't  have won  they would  have had to  shake up  everything 
[02:31:00]  right  right  so  that would  have prevented  because they  hid all this  info  that kept  players coming  to the program  because they  didn't know  anything  so in a way  I understand  it  you know  what  that's a  fucking  good point  because if  Paterno had  to blow up  the whole  program back  then because  Sandusky then  you know  they would have  lost games  they would have  lost a shitload  of games and  players wouldn't  have gone there  they wouldn't  have had bowl  games all that  shit  this guy Mark  Everett  whatever his name  is  I like how he  brought up the  fact win at all  cost mentality  and collegiate  athletics will not 
[02:31:30]  be taught  because he has a  whole fucking  league to worry  about  not just football  every sport  actions that  you've heard  about  the NCAA  right  let's bring  in BJ  Schechter  BJ  BJ  Schechter  he's a  friend of  mine  oh a  friend  it's not  a relative  that were  handed out  this  they are  pretty much  killing the  program without  burying it  for the next  that's going to  take a while  yeah thank you 
[02:32:00]  four years  anyone who just  joined up for  this program  is still under  those fucking  guise of  bullshit  now anybody  who comes  will know  the facts  like for the  next four  years  right  a lot of  these guys  will absolutely  transfer  to the  schools  they all  will  yeah and  then after  four years  they're starting  from nothing  basically  to try to  rebuild the  program  wow  yeah this  Penn State  football will  be nothing  devastating  who knows  I would say  six seven  years easy  a change 
[02:32:30]  of culture  I don't know  how I was  trying to count  to see how  many times  I heard the  word culture  so this is  really far  more or  should be far  more reaching  than just  Penn State  it is  and I think  what the NCAA  is coming in  and trying to  say and you  can agree or  disagree with  you know  whether they  have the  authority or  whether this  is their  place necessarily  but what  they're saying  is you  know we  are going  to take  a bigger  role in  not only  athletics  but integrity  and you 
[02:33:00]  know I  think that  was you  know the  thing that  President  Emmert  you know  tried to  make clear  that this  was more  of a moral  and institutional  issue  rather than  it's going  to be fun  to watch  Penn State  games  and I  think we  said this  this no  longer makes  Paterno  the all  time winning  coach  which kills  his legacy  obviously  and someone  else said  that one  of their  five star  athletes  already  backed out  before all 
[02:33:30]  this  came down  and that's  why they  took the  statue down  yesterday  obviously  and  they knew  they knew  they were  killing  Paterno's  legacy  today  if you look  at this  case  it's much  much  bigger  wow  huge  we got  the  Paterno  supporters  this audio  I guess  is kind  of old  now that  the  sanctions  are out  there  $60  million  fine  they lose  10  scholarships  a year  for the  next  four  years  no  bowl  games  and 
[02:34:00]  the  athletes  that are  in place  the football  players  that are  in place  can leave  without a  penalty  and that  will  a bunch  of those  guys  who really  believe  they have  a shot  at the  NFL  or whatever  they are  leaving  I need  another  college  I need  to appear  in bowl  games  and all  that shit  and I'll  tell you  why that's  good that  they did  that  because  these poor  athletes  who went  here under  the integrity  of this  great  university  it's  embarrassing  to play  for this  everyone's  thinking  of boy  fucking  who's  going to  fucking  watch  the game  everyone  with a bunch  of boners  in the same  guy who goes 
[02:34:30]  the wrong  way with the  points  but you  can't  and I bet  you a lot  of those  guys are  relieved  they're like  oh fuck  good  I can  leave this  place  without a  penalty  I bet  you they're  happy about  that  you watch  in the coming  days you're  going to hear  about football  players leaving  for other  programs  they're going  to all  abandon ship  if they  can  what's that  oh boy  where are  the  Penn State  supporters 
[02:35:00]  today  they know  this  Louis Free  and they're  right by the  way that  guy asked  a good  question  this is  an indictment  as opposed  to a  conviction  and he  goes well  and this  fucking  guy said  well the  university  agreed  to all  of it  so they  know  that a  longer  investigation  Penn State  wants this  done  we'll take  our medicine  and fucking  whatever  that's much  harsher  than I  expected  and they're  on double  secret  probation  well they  didn't  want to  mister  dude they  took 13  years  of fucking 
[02:35:30]  college football  wins away from  that  amazing  and that was  more to just  kill paternal's  legacy  and also to  say a lot of  people feel like  he's skated  winning at  fucking all  costs  will not be  tolerated  at first I thought  it was outrageous  but when you  think about it  for a second or  two and hear  what he had to  say I  understand it  I understand  and you're  right they do  have basketball  and I think  that's what  they got  everything  the way  they handle  this brings  all college  sports and  the integrity  of all college  sports into  light so it's  like kill this  one and it 
[02:36:00]  shows that we  don't put stuff  on the culture  of winning at  all costs which  which we all  know is happening  in collegiate  schools  it's an inside  job  black ops  to bring down  the colleges  black ops  yeah  yeah  I guess the  audio of  paterno supporters  and the statue  doesn't mean  anything today  because I want to  hear some of the  supporters  Penn State  fans and supporters  could not hold  back their anger  and disappointment  as they looked  through a hole  in the fence  where the Joe  Paterno statue 
[02:36:30]  once stood  I think they  did the worst  job for this  for a university  and for the city  well said  he's not alive  anymore  he can't defend  himself  leave the man  alone  acting on the  orders of  university  president  Rodney Erickson  a crew  built a fence  around the statue  pried it loose  with jackhammers  and towed  the seven foot  tall 900 pound  bronze statue  inside Beaver  Stadium  are you also  going to take  down the  library that  you know  he helped  donate millions  of dollars 
[02:37:00]  I mean  where does it  stop  49 years  and the stadium  is here  because of him  and if you're  going to take  down the statue  then take  down the stadium  may as well  clean house  these dummies  it's amazing  how  he's there  because of him  so is  fucking boy  fucking  because he  turned a blind eye  because he did  do good things  I don't think  Paterno overall  was a horrible  man  I think he just  handled this  terribly  but I mean  even worse  than we thought  but you don't  take down the  fucking library  you don't undo  everything good 
[02:37:30]  it's almost like  as bad as  Hitler was  you don't just  not use technology  because Nazis  came up with  certain things  tear up the  autobahn  yeah  exactly  oh boy  is fucking  that family  it is amazing  in the course  of a couple  of months  right  yeah  emails  will get  you  wow  trying to be  slick  these cocksuckers  the unnamed  person  well technically  nobody can prove  yeah we all know 
[02:38:00]  what you're saying  yeah exactly  yeah those  fucking  little memos  emails  watch it  fucking  killed  paternal  again  good  ugh  I feel bad  for people  at Penn State  though  like  you know  it's like  they didn't  do anything  wrong  with the  students  well that's  true  and even the  alumni  who have  pride in  the university  you gotta feel  shitty for them  too  it's like  I mean  you guys  put your  hearts into  this place 
[02:38:30]  and you  loved it  and you  genuinely  had great  times there  and your  life was  there  yeah  and then  you realize  there was  all this  boy fucking  little boy fucking  in the showers  and everyone  knew it  except you  no one did  anything  about it  yeah you  didn't know  about it  I think  it is  kind of  fucked up  that  some people  that had  nothing to do  with this  are going to  be penalized  the students  and stuff  and all these  people  they won't  take the  records away  from the  students  I don't  think  I hope  not  you can't  do that  but just  the wins  which is 
[02:39:00]  because individual  wins don't  really matter  when you look  back  like how many  court  I mean  I guess  it does  to the  athletes  right  but  what does  that do  penalize  these wins  they penalize  the university  and they're  penalizing  Paterno  because a lot  of people  feel like  he skated  so you know  they knew  taking away  all those  wins  would make  him not  the winningest  coach anymore  but I wonder  also because  that might  settle some  people's  heads  because he's  dead  literally  you're kidding  throw it 
[02:39:30]  all on him  like  almost like  what was  the movie  where the  fucking  oh there  was a scene  in Game  of Thrones  where there  was the guy  they were  looking for  was alive  and they're  like where  is he  they were  going to  kill him  and they  point to  someone dead  and go  there he  is  yeah  yeah  yeah  that's  that's what  this is  in a way  although  Paterno  that email  gave them  the excuse  to do it  yeah  that's a  harsh penalty  man  big time  I would have  thought that  they were  just going to  throw out  all the  hats  in the  gift shop  all the 
[02:40:00]  Penn State  hats  throw out  there's  65 hats  throw them  out  and Penn State  is fighting  we'll give  up 10  but not  65  we think  this is  fair  unbelievable  yeah  that is  not unbelievable  no it is  pretty fucking  unbelievable  wow  you think  that's uh  that's pretty  harsh  I don't think  any college  has been  sanctioned  like this  in the past  for their  fucking boy  fucking  exploits  holy  mackerel  yeah  that's a  good one  and and 
[02:40:30]  you know  I think  it's pretty  amazing  and I  don't even  give a  flying fuck  imagine  these people  yes I  know  imagine  these people  in  Pennsylvania  that love  Penn State  oh man  here's more  audio from  the statue  the university  president called  the statue  a source of  division and  an obstacle  to healing  very sandusky  is the one  that did  the actual  crime  Joe said  he should  have done  more  but that  doesn't mean  we should  just erase  everything  good he  ever did  Ted Willis 
[02:41:00]  accused  the university  of giving  in to  demand  I'm disillusioned  considering  that Mr.  Paterno  gave his  entire life  to his  university  and now  they're having  to try to  remove all  traces of  his presence  here on  campus  he says  I should  have done  more  but he's  not the  only one  that's culpable  yeah I know  the only one  that's culpable  no of course  not  culpable  they're going  after everybody  that was involved  yeah  I think this  statue coming  down  yeah you know  it's just  a reminder  anyone that  looks at that  statue is like  ah there's the 
[02:41:30]  guy that  didn't say  shit when he  knew somebody  was fucking  boys in the  ass  they didn't  just  they dug  him up  and they  put on  cleats  and stepped  on his  fucking  face  and kicked  him  and they  took his  family  and they  go watch  this  yeah  and they  kicked him  I'm for it  good fuck  him  I think  yeah you got  Sandusky  who's in  prison  but then  you got  Penn State  which  wanted  wants to  distance itself  so much 
[02:42:00]  from Sandusky  but it  still has to  do something  to show  that it's  you know  it's sorry  so they  yeah  dug up  Joe  and they  just pound  the shit  out of him  he's  he's the  face to  put on  he's the  Penn State  face  that gets  put on  this whole  thing  13 years  of wins  what happened  to the  what happened  to the  guy that  was in  charge of  the university  at the 
[02:42:30]  time  they're in  big trouble  are they  they should  take away  anyone who  knew  like you  know  like the  curly  I hope  they're taking  away complete  pensions  and all  this  union  shit  they got  to deal  with  then  try to  go against  the union  as far  as getting  their pension  I don't know  if the union  will fight  that  boy fucking  well  I don't know  those guys  should be in  big trouble  I mean  it's obvious  they really  knew  and never  went to  real  authorities  no one  went to  the real  authorities  they're in  legal trouble  and they sit 
[02:43:00]  there and go  well you know  the university's  got its own  policing and  everything and  we took care of  it internally  no you didn't  no university is  going to take  care of something  internally if  it's detrimental  to them and  really have  transparency with  it you've got to  go to an  outside agency  I'd love to  know what  these emails  said that  Paterno knew  because I love  the way these  snakes  these fucking  snake cocksuckers  were talking  about it  like in that  way that  children talk  pig Latin  trying to cover 
[02:43:30]  it up  it's obviously  it was a  cover up  well the  person  like technically  no one knows  what we're  saying  yeah  Louis Freak  I'm so glad  you don't want  Louis Free  investigating your  computer I guess  that's bad news  you're in  Dutch  when there's  boy fucking  charges  and that  shithead  that shithead  stood out in  front of his  house  I just want to  coach one more  game  that fucking  shithead  they killed the 
[02:44:00]  program today  they really did  it's going to  take a while to  come back from  that  I retweeted  somebody who  said that they  should have put  Joe Paterno's  statue in the  library to  remind all the  kids to keep  quiet  whoever tweeted  that I don't  know if you  stole it or if  you read it's  god damn funny  and I'm annoyed  I didn't think  in that moment  that's why I  don't want to  watch Louis  that's why I  don't want to  watch stand  ups because  when I hear a  fucking piece of  brilliance like  that I'm like  cocksucker I  stink 
[02:44:30]  that is a  clever fucking  line  I don't want to  know how good  other people are  at being funny  fuck that was  that was the  fan that wrote  that  I wrote it  yeah that was  that was just a  dickhead that  wrote that  oh man  please I'm  pulling your  fucking leg  don't go  shoot me in  the asshole  and cunt  it was fun  we were at  aunt's house  fucking each  other's butt  with the guns  is that illegal  oh chip  no such thing 
[02:45:00]  well  fucking each  other with the  guns  yeah fucking  each other's  butts  yeah  butts  yeah  and then we  would smell the  guns and go  smells like your  hiney  and you'd go  smells like your  hiney  and we'd have  Tostitos  they did have  Tostitos  someone's saying  Penn State will  argue that  kid touching  and football  are totally  different  that's why  it'll be  reversed  no it won't  be  Penn State  agreed to  this  right  they're gonna  keep their  fucking mouth  shut  who said  is that guy  on the phone 
[02:45:30]  yeah  I would love  to hear  maybe he  knows  something  we don't  uh  Tom in  Boston  what's up  Tom  hey  you know  more than I  do about  this  NCAA  is one of  the weakest  organizations  on the  planet  but like  he said  this is so  unprecedented  that they  actually  finally  stepped up  and did  the right  thing  I think  they're doing  this  to cover  their ass  so they'll  look good  Penn State  will make  the argument  that kid  touching and  football wins  are unrelated  I don't  I don't know  how you 
[02:46:00]  how you  even bring  that argument  up to  anybody  I think  everyone  just goes  away  and feels  like  you know  they got  something  out of  this  Penn State  certainly  could have  lost  their entire  program  they're like  alright  we'll take  the fucking  hit  considering  that  there was  kid fucking  on the  campus  for the last  12  14 years  whatever it  would be  so we'll  take the  four years  and then  we'll rebuild  from there  the 60 million  is nothing  to us  the money  is laughable  probably to them  and then the  NCAA  goes see  we did  something  and everyone  goes away  kind of happy 
[02:46:30]  in a weird  way  and it went  all the way  up to the  president  this wasn't  like just  the coach  this was like  the beloved  power  and the  fucking  university  president  I mean  this dude  this goes  so far  Penn State  will not  fight this  they're gonna  take their  fucking medicine  and shut  the fuck up  and I think  they're gonna  go you know  what they're  relieved  that it was  only this  believe it or  not  because the  paterno family  fighting it  looks fucking  bad for the  paterno family  if Penn State  tries to fight  it  they know  how bad 
[02:47:00]  I don't fault  his family  though  I mean  I understand  why you'd  fight  you don't  want to  believe that  shit  but dude  Penn State  will not  fight this  because the  NCAA  if they didn't  do enough  the way we  look at  college sports  in this  country  would have  been re-evaluated  like literally  they may have  lost so much  in TV money  and fuck  they may have  lost certain  privileges  that they  now have  and the  NBA  or the  NFL  may have 
[02:47:30]  changed  the way  they do  business  with colleges  like this  was going  to blow  up everybody's  fucking spot  and with the  damaged football  program they  absolutely lose a lot  more than the  60 million they  got to pay the  NCAA but  yeah  oh yeah  but they laugh  at that figure  I bet you  yeah  I think the  next step is to  change the name  of the fucking  place  I wouldn't want  to send my  kid to Penn State  at this point  are they still  going to play  football just no  bowl games  yeah they're  going to play  they're going  to get  it's just  going to be  a silly  program  shitty players  that can't  get anywhere  else  yeah  yeah  they're going 
[02:48:00]  to play  sir  are you still  there  yeah I agree  that this should  have been  this is a  fantastic punishment  I love it  but I think  Penn State  has so much  to lose  as you all  said  I think  what they'll  do is  off some  people  off the  president  off these  people  as an  appeasement  dude they  don't have a  choice  yeah I think  they got to  take it  I really  think they  got to  take this  one  they're going  to take  it  I really  think  they  gotta  vacating  13  years 
[02:48:30]  you know  how many  schools  suck  that now  have a  win  against  Penn State  yeah  and now  you're going  to have  players  leaving  I mean  the program  is going  to be  a joke  for the  next  bunch  of  years  foreseeable  maybe  even  for the  foreseeable  future  I mean  the penalties  are for  the next  four years  but then  after that  the guy  to kind  of  rebuild  from  almost  nothing  yes  so  indeed  he  did  I  understand  someone on  twitter  saying  the concept  of pretending  games had  different outcomes  is just  dumb  dude no one's 
[02:49:00]  pretending  the games had  different outcomes  I get that  in a way I get  that part  but I think  it was more  to like  kind of  punish  Paterno  because they  can't really  do anything  to him  and it's  symbolic  it's  symbolic  that fucking  the legacy  of a sports  program  will not be  more important  than what  they did  and that's  why they're  taking those  wins away  and you  know what  70 years  from now  there will  still be  this block  of 13  years of  straight losses  and everybody  will know  it's because  of this  fucking scandal  that'll never  go away 
[02:49:30]  they in a  really weird  way  put a  fucking  permanent  tattoo on  Penn State  because  scandals  go away  even this  one  25 years  from now  will have  passed  it'll be a  thing in the  past  that you  look at  like Kent  State  which you  know  horrible  tragedy  but the  school  is a  permanent  white out  no school  is winless  in 13  years  but this  block  of  fucking  L's 
[02:50:00]  is a  scar  that will  follow  Penn State  forever  and they  knew how  much  that would  hurt  Paterno's  legacy  and they  they're  basically  saying  man  this guy  really  did  know  a lot  and really  should have  done  something  way more  than what  he did  this was  more than  Joe Paterno  just going  I'm not  too sure  what we should  do  this is  him being  an active  part of  the cover  so how  do we  punish him  through this  whole thing  the win  at all  cost  they could  have shut  down their  football program  that's why  Penn State  will not  fight  they'll just  shut up 
[02:50:30]  man now  you're a  parent  and you  got a  kid  that's  starting  to think  about  college  like  I would  imagine  a lot  of  parents  are  going  to say  not  Penn State  no  immediately  Penn State  you could  probably start  a quarterback  to be done  what else  planned  but I just  mean as a  regular student  even  that seems  like it  would be  a tough  place to  go  in the  coming  years  I'm going  to go  perform  at Penn  State  yeah  oh my  god  sorry  I have  to buy  some  options  for what  I have  to buy  some Apple 
[02:51:00]  options  yeah  yeah  what are  they  announcing  nothing  it just  took a  big shit  on Friday  what did  shit  today  Apple  god damn  it's the  fucking  whole market  stinks  right  so  yeah  that's  the  conspiracy  of course  I buy  Facebook  and it  drops  again  at  fucking  Zuckerberg  I hope  his feet  get caught  in a  lawnmower  you're back  in  yeah  but what  price  32  oh that's  good  what is  that  27  I'm the  kiss  of death  I'm a  mush  with stock  but I'm  not dropping  it again  I'm gonna  stick with  it 
[02:51:30]  if it  goes down  to four  I'll drop  it  yeah  all right  hey do we  have more  audio on that  couple  do we go  through that  audio from  the  oh yeah  yeah  are we moving  on from  yeah  oh no  Silvio is  mad at me  let's see  Silvio  415  you're the  biggest prick  on earth  you look  like one  two  get a  life  for what  reason  Paul  I don't know  on Twitter  I guess  he's a big  Penn State  fan  Paul 
[02:52:00]  Stancato  that's what  his name  is on  Twitter  I don't  know  he said  it to  me in  a public  forum  oh  what  happened  I don't  know  I'm going  to tweet  him back  I guess  he doesn't  like the  fucking  nice  what  happened  Apple  600  calls  August  that's  my  that's  where I'm  in  fucking  hey man  now I need  Apple to  just go  back up  that's all  it's got to  do  is go  back up  and I  win  that's it 
[02:52:30]  I'm back  in  better not  just take  another  shit  it happens  every time  I buy  options  I can't  just  like  it goes  up  and then  I punch  out  it has  to go  down  and I  gotta  wait  for the  fucking  shit  to come  back  you  motherfucker  there's  no reason  that it's  down  today  though  the whole  market  is down  like  220  points  it  opened  200  points  down  this is  crazy  it's 
[02:53:00]  because  of  Europe  again  with the  euro  increase  and  whatnot  so  you know  what  Apple's  Apple  if it's  being dragged  down by  this fucking  European  quagmire  people will  realize  that  you know  it's still  the great  company  moneymaker  that it's  been  and  then  comes  back  and  then  I  punch  out  that's  how  that  shit  works  exactly  right  that's  what I  say  what are  you in 
[02:53:30]  I mean  I'm in  Dutch  you know  what I  think  oh  you're  in  trouble  yeah  I  think  this  makes  Bobby  Bobby  Bowden  the  all-time  winningest  college football  coach  holy  fuck  who's that  who is  Bobby  Bowden  no clue  you have  no idea  no  that's too  bad  who is he  I don't  know him  either  Bobby  Bowden  oh I  know who  he is  he goes  Bowden on  the lake  oh boy  he's mostly 
[02:54:00]  known for  being the  head coach  at Florida  State  oh it's  oh you  said okay  I know  Bowden  is it  Bowden  yeah yeah  yeah  that's  no I  don't  know  they just  have been  saying it  on  it might  be  Bowden  I don't  know  either  I just  left it  out  oh  Bobby  Bowden  ah  that makes  sense  he was at  Florida State  from 19  I'm gonna  guess 76  to 2000 
[02:54:30]  he's been  gone a  couple  2009  well he's  coached from  1959 to  2009  yeah but  that's a long  Florida State  from 70  is it 76  I believe  76 to  2009  maybe  what do you  have like  8.57  average wins  per year  just about  that  yeah  yeah  really  impressive  yeah  yeah  it's like  a 74.3  winning percentage  oh yeah  yeah  I shouldn't  I don't even  need to be in  here to talk  no no  no this is  fucking  silent W  or is it  Bowden  I think it's  Bowden  silent B  I'm going  silent W 
[02:55:00]  out and  I'll be  Bowden  oh  I'll be  honest  I had no  idea who  the second  winningest  coach was  no  no idea  you want  to hear from  the couple  yeah  yeah  let's hear  some more  of this  oh goody  I love  this  I'm obsessed  with this  this couple  feel like I  worst at  Paterno  today  this is  if you're  just tuning  and listening  to the  replay  we did

[02:57:00]  part where you  save yourself  and leave him  when does that  happen  well Patricia  she now talks  about how  everyone else  helped her  except him  oh no  and there was  a point where  the gunshots  stopped  and I saw  people running  and I thought  they're running  he's not  shooting  just get up  and go  and I just  got up  I grabbed my  daughter's hand  and we just  we just got  out of there  as soon as  we could  you ran  yeah  I was trying 
[02:57:30]  to find Jamie  I didn't have  my phone  thankfully  there were  three people  two boys  and a girl  I wish I  would have  gotten their  name  the female  let me  her cell phone  so that I  could call  Jamie  help me  with my  daughter  you know  and I just  I'm thankful  for that  just that there  were you know  people who  were willing  to help  people that  were willing  to help  fucking  humiliating  poor Jamie  this next clip  is my favorite  oh there's more  oh yeah  Jamie is the 
[02:58:00]  worst boyfriend  ever  what a hark of  shit  well Jamie  now stresses  the  should I say  it or  no  someone said  we're  misunderstanding  things  he was just  out in the car  getting the air  conditioning going  you know  that's very nice  it's hot  and after  gunfight  the country  has been  suffering  from a lot  of heat  this summer  very hot  we just need  to be there  for each other  and like  be kind  to each other  people come

[02:59:00]  you know what  they are getting  married  so those vows  that's hilarious  oh yeah  I could see  the priest  love honor  and protect  well  I guess we could  cross that  love and honor  in this case  I guess we could  cross that part  cross protect  and then the black  dude will stand up  yo I'll protect her  yeah  I'm on the  motherfucker  we just need  to be there  for each other  and like  be kind  to each other  people come  we rush through  life taking  everything for 
[02:59:30]  granted  like money  clothes  and so  materialistic  and just  getting so  stressed out  he's diverting  one priority  it's like  like I said  family  family's number  one priority  family's number  one priority  number two  number two  family number two  and by the way  you take things  for granted  you think about  money and clothes  you mean like  the matching hat  and fucking  Broncos jersey  you were wearing  you hate this guy  I hate  this guy 
[03:00:00]  he's awful  we all hate him  he's the worst  person  family  number one priority  it's like  like I say  we rush in life  we forget to tell  each other  we love you  we rush in life  yes  we forget to bring  our babies  we rush in life  and we rush out  of movie theaters  alone  yes we forget to  bring our children  oh god  forget to tell  each other  we love you  and it's like  call your friends  call your family  kiss your son  kiss your daughter  hug him 
[03:00:30]  you never know  when it's gonna be  the last time  just don't save them  just remember  seeing his head  looking up at me  seeing his little eyes  and did he say  where you going  do you remember  hearing that  hey dad  where you going  I'm still here  I remember  looking at his head  as I stepped on it  to get to safety  go fuck yourself  I think the baby  was saying  hey dick  my arms and legs  don't really work yet  it's up to you  I remember  looking at his little eyes  his little head 
[03:01:00]  as a darker hand  saved him  while I ran  to safety  and put the radio on  and no one  like  like  whines like this  during an entire interview  I've seen people  get very emotional  during interviews  and they kinda  they kinda calm down  a little  they take a breath  he has this phony  it's a constant  it's a constant  whine diversion  right  please feel sorry for me  because I know  everyone hates me  because I'm a piece of shit  so overwhelmingly 
[03:01:30]  a lot of people  have questions  as far as what  this guy did that night  he has an awful story  yeah I know  but why  the real media  why aren't they  asking them  some of this stuff  because they like  the romance  of him getting married  more  but why don't they  point out  this guy is filled  with shame  he's a bum  he's a bum  he left his son  in there too  right  he didn't grab  the beer  he left all  three of them  yeah  he left all  three  he grabbed the baby  he put the baby  on the floor 
[03:02:00]  look I  you know  when the show  started  I was trying  to have a little  bit of an open  mind for this guy  I'll be honest  but as the show  ends  oh my god  what a hunk  of garbage  fuck  left  his baby  holy fuck  but these  the next  reporter  that has  these guys  they should ask  some tough  questions  it should be us  have you seen  the internet  everyone is  kind of  trashing you  yeah  and then maybe  he'll enlighten  everyone with  an answer  I don't know  I doubt it  yeah  I absolutely  doubt it  he's seeing 
[03:02:30]  his little eyes  and just  crying  just being so  like frustrated  about what to  do  I don't want  him to get  hurt  he's your  little boy  well that was  his most honest  comment at least  he said I was  frustrated trying  to figure out  what to do  yes which way  to go he  should have said  I was trying  to figure out  now that the  beacon is here  drawing gunfire  I can make  a safe getaway  that's good  use the loud  kid to fucking 
[03:03:00]  draw the gunfire  cocksucker  I was very  confused because  I couldn't find  my car keys  right away  yeah I didn't  know that  somebody scratched  my door  and I have  a Broncos hat  and I dropped  it so I stepped  on my son's  face and legs  to get my  Broncos hat  because it  matches  I'm stressed  out I didn't  know where I  parked in the  parking lot  took me a while  to find my car  yes  to put on  my favorite  radio station  and I didn't  get to see  the end of  the movie 
[03:03:30]  and I was  hot so I  turned on the  AC and then  I waited for  the phone to  ring  that's fucking  humiliating  it's pretty bad  what a fucking  bum this guy  is  yes  what a hunk  of shit  wow  you can't  to leave  you  and again  wife and  girlfriend to  me  maybe some  people feel  that way  but I can  understand that  because they're  adults  in nature  I don't know  if it instills  in you the way  it does to  protect the  young  can you imagine 
[03:04:00]  leaving your daughter  I don't  I don't  I don't  know  like wouldn't  you just lay  over her  oh yeah  you'd be getting  bashed in here  what  if I left  oh if you did that  your dumb  interviews on TV  we'd be in here  just bashing you  can you imagine  just fucking  I mean you can't  imagine leaving  I don't know how  you just  I imagine you can  actually  I got  I'm kidding  Travis  Travis turn me  on this one  I hate  this guy  hate him  one  I'm trying  one week  ago 
[03:04:30]  I left that  movie theater  with two bad  knees  18 years ago  I left Dayton  Ohio  with two very  bad knees  and a dream  to live my  life  and a dream  to become a  major league  baseball player  what happened  I thank God  I thank God  I saved my  whole life  he just  fucking  jumped  yeah  left his 
[03:05:00]  family  he's gonna  have to live  with that  that's definitely  gonna come out  does he kill  himself someday  no  I don't know  man  someone's saying  he's probably  gonna get so  frustrated  he shoots up  a theater  Jesus  the circle  of life  yes  alright I'm  out of here  what's up  let's go  what happened  time to go  home believe it  now look at  that fucking  time  we did good  what happened  we've seven  minutes  we've seven  minutes of  fun left  fun and  hijinks and  shenanigans  no commercials  we're good  shenanigans 
[03:05:30]  seven minutes  of fun remains  oh  no not for  these guys  we're going  satellite rules  not terrestrial  rules  we don't have  commercials  no commercials  do we have  commercials  no  how many reads  do we have left  I'm good  zero  oh  there's seven  minutes left  so we'll go  seven minutes  we'll go another  seven  six and a half  maybe  and then of course  the Sam Roberts  post show  extravaganza  that's right  that's what I call it  oh you do  no I call it  the shit show  if you haven't 
[03:06:00]  heard  oh  yeah  I hear  wow  Fezzy was  completely  going off  on the fact  that it's  guns to blame  and he said  the only people  that should have  guns are the  police  and the military  yeah Fez is not  in your corner  he's very pro  gun control  pro gay  he wants guns  completely eliminated  yeah he doesn't want  like the public  he doesn't want  any citizen  ever to be able  to own a gun  he wants it to be  like the UK  what what  but there are  criminals that have  guns there  yes 
[03:06:30]  people get killed  there  I don't understand  very few guns  not even the police  have guns over there  yeah yeah  well the bobbies  bobbies  well they don't  talk about  they have bobby pins  the amount of  people that get  killed from knives  over there  knives are very  big in England  they kill people  with knives  and bludgeonings  people are  bludgeoned over there  people get bludgeoned  with blunt instruments  not that many  bludgeonings over here  we don't get as many  bludgeonings  as you think  we got them guns  we got them guns  yeah  you know what it also is 
[03:07:00]  and people say  why is America like this  you know they put  that little list up  of homicides per year  in various countries  and then the United States  has thousands  and it blows everybody away  and it's like  what is it about our culture  we have such an open society  we're very free  to express ourselves  not um  we don't have a very  contrary to what we said  on this show  literally we don't have  a very um  nurturing government  we're left to our own devices  for the most part  we're abused and assaulted 
[03:07:30]  by our government  as far as money goes  and things like that  but to have an open  and free society  you also open yourself  up to a lot of people's  free will  which  some bad things happen  yeah  sometimes  some things  it happens with speech  all the time  there are these things  that are the price you pay  for being in a free country  yes  and one of those  is this  I don't know where  the violence comes from  I don't know where  this whole fucking  like  but we're not alone 
[03:08:00]  in the world  I mean if you look  at some nations  uh  the violence there  is unbelievable  we're a more violent country  like when you look  at death penalty  like I'm for it emotionally  but I've turned against it  because I think it's unfair  to poor people  I'm against death penalty  because I think that  poor people get it  for the same crimes  that rich people  wouldn't get it for  so I have a problem  with it  because their defense  is not as good  they can't afford  the same defense  we are like  the only non  like  Saudi Arabia uses it  like the countries  that use the death penalty 
[03:08:30]  there's not one of them  we would consider  fun countries  nice and fun  like they're shitty  they also stone people  yeah  they're countries  that we judge morally  the US is weird  like I love this country  but we're not honest  about what and who we are  yes  that's what bugs me  and why can't it  just be accepted  that for all of our greatness  we do have some foibles  we're violent  because all I kept saying  when people would mention  this whole list  of various countries  and their death rates  and the Americans  death rate is so high 
[03:09:00]  I'd be like  yeah  but we went to the moon  also  so could you fucking  list every other country  that went to the moon  oh that's right  there isn't one  like  like it's  it's  there's something  here with this country  the thing that makes it  inherently great  also makes  makes this  these bad things happen  you open yourself up  to certain things  in a freeze  I understand that  if I would like us  so much more  if we were just 
[03:09:30]  honest  about what we are  and what we like  the show  we already know  what the show is  it's mediocre  pieces of shit  bordering on hideous  but as a country  we deny  that we're violent  we deny that we're  sex addicted  we deny all this  it's like just tell  the truth about it  why do we have to  because when we lie  about it  it's like then  we're forced to live  with this facade  and this veneer  and it's not real  do you know how stressful  it is to try to 
[03:10:00]  hold up a lie  for that long  of course I do  yes of course you do  Jimmy  it is  you bring up  a great point  we're  we're not honest  about who we are  and what we are  as a people  and we like to think  we're one thing  and  and lying about it  is  just as bad  as what we're lying about  I think it's more  detrimental  if we were more honest  yes  men  we do love  fucking looking at  pornography  and sex  and when someone's  found to have 
[03:10:30]  looked at some sex  or maybe gotten a  hooker in his youth  he all of a sudden  isn't fit for public  office or anything  it's like  why  you've never done it  right  that's the  hypocritical way  we deny  who we are  when other people  get in trouble  it's why we're obsessed  with celebrities  getting in trouble  yes  it's why we're obsessed  with all this stuff  because it makes us  feel better  it like  it strengthens  the facade  for the rest of us  when you're exposed  my cover 
[03:11:00]  is even greater  it's this ugly  fucking thing  and maybe other countries  have it  I can only deal with  America because I live here  but it's the part  of our country  of our makeup  as a public  that I despise  and it's why  I hate when people  think like  oh we're being shocking  or we're not  I don't respect  these fucking  sacred cows  or  these societal  boundaries  of what's appropriate  language wise  because I don't buy it  I don't believe  your fucking outrage 
[03:11:30]  if everybody  was outraged  about black jokes  and Asian jokes  and rape jokes  regardless of circumstance  regardless of who did them  and regardless of context  I would respect  society's  decision  but that's not  how it is  it's fraudulent  and arbitrary  and attention grabbing  and we're the same way  with fucking  everything else  it's just a fraudulent  fucking persona  we have 
[03:12:00]  so how do people  think that we're  going to solve  all these problems  when no one's  even honest  about what  problems there are  and what we are  as a country  the whole way  this country started  with this puritanical  bullshit and everything  and right from the start  there was  debauchery going on  so it's just been this  constant bullshitting  and dishonesty  because we've gotten  so obsessed  with winning the argument  and I've said this before  but everything we do 
[03:12:30]  is jockeying  for position  in the next debate  like  like Carlin  had a brilliant bit  on you know  the constitutioners  and the founding forefathers  being full of shit  and they were  yes  they were  full of shit  and somebody pointed out  once and he was right  they were brilliant  with constructing  a government  like they really  the government we have  if the laws are followed  as written  are wonderful  but it's the underlying  people were frauds  they were slave owning pigs  who wanted it all 
[03:13:00]  for themselves  well it was a  do as I say  not as I do  kind of an atmosphere  and we're still like that  but this is why  other countries don't like us  because we go over there  and tell them  do as I say  not as I do  it's like at least  keep our fucking  full of shitness  to ourselves  full of shitness  fucking annoying  we really are  dirtbags  but when you say this  people are like  love it or leave it buddy  no  I do love this country  and I love it enough  to criticize it  and I can criticize it  which is the beauty of it  and being honest about it  I mean  not many people are honest 
[03:13:30]  yeah  because you know  people don't want to look  at their faults  they don't want to look  in a mirror  and start fucking  picking at yourself  and saying what's bad  and as a country  I don't think anybody  wants to do that  you want to believe that  hey  what's the company line  we're the greatest nation  on the face of the earth  we're a free nation  we have the ability  to do this  the American dream  is attainable  but you know  if you really  turn inward  and look  we are a bunch  of just despicable  dirtbags  lying about  who and what we are  and where we came from  we're jerking off 
[03:14:00]  obsessively  and we wonder  why Tiger Woods  fucked another girl  right  like I'm not saying  you gotta like it  but this fucking  how could they do  I don't know  what it is ingrained  in our psyche  where we need  to lie  about who we are  so much  and I don't mean  we should reveal  everything  but this fucking  underlying nonsense  it drives me crazy  it really is  it drives me crazy  it's almost like  you can't blame people  though  because like I said  they don't want to see that  a lot of people 
[03:14:30]  and a lot of people  wouldn't even recognize it  you know  they wouldn't  but again  don't be mad at me  when I don't respect  those fucking  phony dotted lines  you put up  I don't think I'm a rebel  or a maverick  I just  because it changes  every fucking two weeks  you know how fun  fucking women are  it's just fun  or is  it's just a fun thing  to do  so when Tiger Woods  does it  and everyone's outraged  by it  the guys that are outraged  they love how their dick feels  in women  they love it 
[03:15:00]  here's what the headlines  should have read  Tiger Woods  has a fun life  that's how the headlines  should have read  yes  I gotta go  I have a doctor's appointment  in 20 minutes  alright  I'm out of here too  I got things to do  Kenny  I'll be right down  and everybody else  you have yourself  a pleasant day  or at least a decent day  I don't really care  pleasant  do you care how their day goes  no  day goes  alright  what are you waiting for  go we rock 
[03:15:30]  you've heard about it  you've waited  four long hours  for it  and now the moment  you've waited for  rears its ugly nose  head  after Opie and Anthony  live  is coming up next  we're going to die  I think we've got a chance  to see you  I'm out of here  we're going to die  you  I'm out of here  you  I'm out of here  you  I'm out of here  I'm out of here </pre>
