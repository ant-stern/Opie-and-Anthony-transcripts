<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the introduction of guest Paul Mercurio, along with the hosts' phone number.  The conversation quickly devolved into absurd hypotheticals, like Opie fighting underwater à la *The Matrix*, before shifting to a caller named Howie.  Mercurio then plugged his upcoming performance at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  He subsequently recounted a series of bizarre news stories: a hippo killing a security guard, a man dying from a tick infestation, a man finding his wife working as a prostitute in Berlin, and Indian students firebombing their principal’s car over cheating.  The hosts punctuated these stories with their own brand of humor, comparing them to the absurdity of regular news.

Next, the show delved into a blow-by-blow account of "Spaz," a show employee, crashing the show's van.  Numerous callers, including Mike from the garage and Rod (who provided audio evidence), described the event and Spaz's post-accident behavior.  Spaz himself called in, blaming his blind spot and following instructions from Big Kev.  The discussion was rife with insults and humorous descriptions of the accident, with callers offering escalating estimates for repair costs.  The segment ended with much debate and speculation regarding the damage and Spaz's responsibility.

The broadcast then revisited a previous show featuring Ron Jeremy and a 46-year-old virgin named Patty.  The hosts recounted the challenge of finding money hidden in Ron Jeremy's pants and groin area, playing audio clips of Patty's attempts.  The segment involved graphic descriptions of Patty's struggles and Ron Jeremy's anatomy, using vulgar language to detail her discomfort and reactions.  These recordings were mentioned as being available online at WNEW.com and FoundryMusic.com. This "Stalker Patty" segment was repeated and elaborated upon later in the show with even more graphic details of her attempts to retrieve the money, accompanied by vulgar commentary from the hosts.

Ron and Fez, hosts of a preceding show, were in the studio during a discussion about a letter to Dan Savage regarding a straight man receiving oral sex from men at a gay gym.  The hosts debated whether this made the man gay.  The conversation segued into the removal of "too gay" billboards in the Bronx by their company, Infinity Outdoor, sparking further humorous debate on the definition of homosexuality.

The final segment started with personal anecdotes from Opie and his brother Elmo about their impoverished childhoods, including using grocery bags as lunch bags and book covers. Adam Ferrara joined the show, prompting a discussion about Brewer's mother, focusing on her appearance and a drunken anecdote.  The segment concluded with sexually suggestive comments about Brewer's mother and sister.  Earlier, a call from Jim Brewer, whose mother was in the studio, detailed the family's drinking habits and various drunken escapades, including public intoxication and embarrassing incidents.  His mother also contributed her own stories.  The hosts also interviewed Sam, a participant in a Valvoline motor oil promotion where he lived in his car for 50 days, with the interview punctuated by technical difficulties and numerous crude jokes at Sam’s expense.  An Adam Ferrara comedy show was advertised throughout.

The show included a prank phone call segment focusing on getting callers to speak, and a discussion mocking repetitive news coverage of heatwaves, particularly the predictable imagery used.  The hosts then recounted a past incident where they used binoculars to observe an elderly woman across the street from their hotel, incorporating sexually suggestive language and descriptions of her appearance and actions.  The segment concluded with further vulgar jokes about older women, their appearance, hygiene, and aging.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.P.S. and the name. 
[00:00:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  In the studio, Paul Mercurio, very funny guy.  Hey, guys.  If you want to get a hold of us, 877-692-1027.  That song makes me want to fight underwater. 
[00:01:00]  Great.  You want to go to Howie real fast?  You must get drunk and go crazy on your fish tank, right?  Yeah.  Hop in the fish tank.  Start slapping the tropical fish around.  He beats up the deep sea diver at the bottom of the tank to blow the bubbles out.  Takes his treasure away.  Hey, that's not that funny.  Hey, Frenchie.  Howie, what's up?  Yo, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Yo, can you just picture O.P. fighting this guy looking like the Matrix?  Moral flow?  Yeah, it can be like the Matrix.  You can do those Matrix moves in the water, floating. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, you can kind of just hang there.  The nice thing is you can be the same wooden actor as Keanu Reeves.  Underwater.  All right, Howie, thanks.  Take it easy.  Can I tell you something real quick?  Yeah.  I just found out before I came over here that I got the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Oh.  It's actually a pretty big thing for stand-up.  So, I'm very excited.  Oh, look at that.  I may not, but you may have to start talking to my people now.  Your peeps.  It happens with all of you.  As soon as I get people, I will have to have them start talking to you. 
[00:02:00]  Have them talk to us.  Hey, Paul brought in some cute stories for our radio show today.  Cute.  Oh, thank God.  Cute.  That's good.  No, you brought in a great one last time.  So, I shouldn't make fun of you.  I got one right here.  You had a really, some good ones last time.  Hippo kills hotel security guard.  Well, that fits the mood of the conversation right now.  An adult male hippo attacked and killed a, this is in Johannesburg, killed a security  guard at a smart South African resort. 
[00:02:30]  I don't know what smart, what a smart South African resort is.  Police and wildlife officers said, this is the quote from somebody who saw it.  The guard saw the hippo early on Monday morning eating grass on the resort's golf course and  his boss told him to observe its movements.  I'm observing its movements.  It's, I'm observing, I'm observing that it's sparing me with its snout.  I am observing that I just had my testicles removed.  I am observing that I am bleeding.  I'm dying.  I'm dead. 
[00:03:00]  I'm, what the, what is going on in this studio?  I've, I've played some golf in my day, but I never remember seeing a hippopotamus on  the golf course.  And this is a great resort.  Like this is supposed to be a good resort.  And there's hippos on the golf course.  One of the radio stations too.  Maybe a miniature golf course.  How close are you getting if you're observing?  I mean, how do you get yourself that close to a hippo?  Where he then kills you.  Exactly.  Well, what was the other story that you had last time where they, um, that was hilarious.  With a guy, um.  With the, what was all over his body? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, ticks.  How did that go?  The ticks.  The guy got attacked by ticks.  He died because too many ticks.  Yeah, 150 ticks attacked him.  Riding the bicycle.  Yeah, and I said, if you get attacked, that's natural selection at work.  It's like a slug coming at you.  And you're going like, oh my God, a slug.  I got to eat dinner and, and polish my shoes and make a suit and get out of the way.  Yeah.  It's ticks.  It's ticks.  Then there's this guy who's on his way to the brothel, uh, to, in Berlin, out of, to get a little action. 
[00:04:00]  And he runs into his wife, who is on the side, a prostitute.  What are the odds of that?  Oh my God.  It's just maybe servicing somebody, you know, and he's like, oh, uh, have her toss your salad.  She does that really well.  Oh God.  So he's a John?  He was, uh, going to see a prostitute?  He was going to see a prostitute, and he ran into his wife, who was secretly working as a prostitute, in Berlin.  That's, uh...  Those wacky Germans. 
[00:04:30]  Why don't they just stick to taking over the world?  Why don't they stick to losing world wars?  Leaving the prostitution to the people like, uh...  Principal got a pact for not letting students cheat.  The guy in India suffered major burns when students hurled gasoline bombs at his car after the school refused to let them cheat on an exam.  Do you believe these international stories that turn up on the internet?  No, I see, no, because we see this stuff on the show.  We did a story about half a pony, half a zebra today.  I saw that in the paper now. 
[00:05:00]  We've done a whole story on it.  A whole story.  Thank God for the Daily Show and their news, because I just don't get my fix of the real news at 11 o'clock on any of the networks or anything.  You never see Tom Brokaw going, and now a story about a half-zebra, half-jacka coming up.  After my retrospective on the Achille Laurel.  He took the summer off, you know.  You remember the cruise ship Achille Laurel and Tom Brokaw NBC Nightly News. 
[00:05:30]  This just in, a tick, a big swarm of ticks has attacked people on bicycles, screaming to get away, saying,  Oh, my God, I can't get my bike into lured gear.  Horrible carnage as the ticks suck their blood.  They're on my bell.  Get them off my bell.  I can't believe this happened.  Tom Brokaw NBC Nightly News, this out of South Africa, at a resort, a hippopotamus attacks a security guard in a resort golf course. 
[00:06:00]  The man was quoted saying,  Oh, my God, what kind of God is there if I'm being killed by a hippopotamus?  What am I, a goddamn cartoon character?  Of course, the tragedy of the Achille Laurel.  How do you hire a network anchor that can't say a letter L? 
[00:06:30]  Achille Laurel.  And the man pushed off in the wheelchair, of course, was...  Oh.  Leon Klinghoffer.  Leon Klinghoffer pushed from the deck of the Achille Laurel.  Thank God there were no llamas involved in that.  Because if I had to say a llama, Achille Laurel, and Leon Klinghoffer, I'd drown in my own saliva. 
[00:07:00]  A lisping anchor man.  But on key.  Truck driver in Berlin had to go to the hospital.  Berlin again.  With a 31-inch long spear stuck in his ass.  I swear to God.  Make your own joke.  Another tragic spear in the ass story.  The man identified as Mario S.  Obviously, we wouldn't want to give your name out there.  Said the spear hooked tip stuck two inches into his butt when he bent over and accidentally came in contact with it.  Oh, one of those stories.  What are you doing in your life?  You accidentally come in... 
[00:07:30]  Your pants are down and you're accidentally back into a spear.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  Strangely enough, this has happened with me.  I was cleaning some lamps on the ladder.  And you know how high up you're getting.  And I was in the nude.  The way I like to clean.  I landed on one of my many news Emmys.  Which were lodged inside my colon.  Hole.  Hole.  In my butt.  And it took a team of doctors to un-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-loge. 
[00:08:00]  Holy Christ.  Un-lo-loge the Emmy.  The daytime Emmy.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  Me and the guys on the javelin team, we were showering.  And I was hanging out.  It says that he...  The spear was leaned up against a closet.  If this guy's not gay, I'm going to get a sex change operation.  As I bent over, I leaned backwards into it.  I'm not a freak.  I missed the dildo.  It was right next to it.  I'm not some kind of a freak. 
[00:08:30]  I was on the fence.  Do I want the dildo or the spear?  The dildo or the spear?  I'm into African cultural decorations.  I'm just happy.  It could have been an Easter Island head.  I know it's not Africa.  Don't email me.  Shut up.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I'm a little woozy today, as usual.  Probably one of the most boring anchors in the world.  With all this.  I was painting my house today.  It was a little chilly, and I didn't open the window, so the fumes from the paint came out. 
[00:09:00]  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom, you're live on the radio.  Hostages in Iran.  No, Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  The Eye of Colossal Lane.  Tom.  Yes, call NBC Nightly News.  Tom Brokaw.  How did they remove the Emmy?  Because the doctor cautiously dislodged the spear and sewed the wound shut.  Don't make me say Vaseline.  Why are there so many words with the letter L?  I hate L. 
[00:09:30]  Would you like a lollipop?  Lollipop.  I'm a goddamn network news anchor on NBC Nightly News.  Even my title of the show, Nightly News.  I can't even say that.  Why can't I be on TRL?  Oh, that doesn't work.  Notice his book, The Greatest Generation?  Yeah.  No Ls.  The Greatest Generation.  A generation without Ls.  WW2.  Yeah, I can say that.  Korea.  Vietnam.  The Gulf War. 
[00:10:00]  Hey, these are things I should do work on.  Goal.  That's an easy L for Tom Brokaw.  I mean, it's a tragedy is John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane.  Oh, Christ.  Goes down off Martha's Vineyard.  The Coast Guard ship, the grass, trying to get the wreckage.  How come I can't say W?  The wreckage.  You can say W.  W, R, combination, almost an L.  I'm like some kind of a weird chink. 
[00:10:30]  Fly life.  Maybe there's an Asian background.  I'm doing an expose.  Tom Brokaw.  Asia?  Who knows?  Next NBC Nightly News.  As soon as I take this Emmy out of my butt.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad. 
[00:11:00]  Ho-ya!  Cirxman from wall to wall.  Ho-ya!  1027 WNEW.  All right, you're listening to the most interactive radio show in America, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Our listeners are a huge part of this goddamn radio show.  You guys are going to get us fired one day, but what the hell will go for broke?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  A lot of people checking out the damage to the WOW van, Anthony.  Yeah.  If you weren't listening to the whole show yesterday, Spaz went to the WOW sticker stop. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And, well, he crashed the van in front of a, I don't know, three, four, maybe 500 listeners.  Yeah, he hit a cement pillar that was in front of the place.  He was trying to back up onto a sidewalk or something.  What a tool.  And he, like, was trying to get over the curb, so it's like...  No, didn't he go up a handicap ramp, and it wasn't wide enough, so the wheel went poof.  Only one of his wheels were able to fit on the handicap ramp. 
[00:12:00]  The other one was on the curb.  So he had to gas it.  But as he's gassing it, he's, like, got the wheels cut.  So when it finally pops over the curb, it goes off to the right and smacks into the cement pole.  Yeah.  So we went down into the garage, and we finally got pictures of the damage.  I'm looking over here.  And you can check them out at www.com.  Just go to Opie and Anthony.  And your comments right off the bat. 
[00:12:30]  When he says it was nothing, no, this isn't nothing.  Yeah, it's not totaled.  I mean, obviously, but this is something that you would really be upset about if it was your car, and it didn't have, it wasn't beat up, it had just been painted, and you come home and see this on it, you would freak the F out.  Oh, yeah, look at the mirror.  All I know, dude, when I got, remember when I got my Cougar, like, I don't know, three or four years ago?  Sure.  And I had just gotten it. 
[00:13:00]  It was brand new.  First new car I ever owned in my life.  So psyched to have it.  It was black, beautiful.  I park it at a rest stop to run in and take a leak and get a soda.  I come out.  Someone had opened their door and put a ding right in the door.  I swear, if I would have known who that was, I would have killed the person.  For a ding in the door, I would have killed the person.  Now, fast forward to spaz doing this to the van, which had just been painted, doesn't have body damage, and he says it's nothing. 
[00:13:30]  Now, if a ding on the door set me off, imagine if I saw this kind of damage on my vehicle.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to show you how, like, really bad this is.  We have Mike from the garage in the studio.  He's a good friend of ours.  Yeah.  I see him every day.  And Mike was telling everyone around here that spaz is a complete tool.  Yeah, man.  He's crazy.  He's so crazy.  He can't drive.  No.  Because when he came to pick up the vehicle, he's holding his head down.  Yeah.  I was saying, man, this guy looks like a sick guy. 
[00:14:00]  You know?  His head's all down.  I was going to hoax him for his driver's license.  I swear, man.  Because you see, yeah, because he looks so nervous, you know?  You look like he's ready to steal it or something.  You see all the guys go down into the garage to get the van and stuff.  Yeah, like Earl.  Earl.  I used to see Ben.  And Ben and Psycho Mark.  They're all relatively normal, right?  You never thought.  This guy was, you know, just holding his head down.  I was like, man, I'm not going to give the vehicle to this guy, you know?  I can't believe it. 
[00:14:30]  Ah, here he is.  All right, spaz.  Hey, spaz.  Spaz, you are out of your mind.  I got to say it.  Did you see the damage to the van?  Yeah.  And you say it's nothing.  It's a paint job.  It is.  Okay.  Okay.  First, now, before you say anything, we have pictures.  Come here.  Look at this picture.  Do you see that this is actually dented?  That's dented.  I went down.  You've got to be correct.  I went down last night and looked at this van. 
[00:15:00]  What, are you going to go to the hobby store and get some matte black that you paint your  Estes model rockets with and just go over it?  How are you going to paint that?  A paintbrush.  Look, it's dented right here, right by where the seam of the door meets, and on the other  side, and over here.  I went down and looked, and you tried slapping a sticker over it?  Last night, I went downstairs to look at it, and I'm like, where's the script?  Oh, look, look.  He put a sticker over it.  Good as new.  Now, let's back up.  What happened yesterday? 
[00:15:30]  Well, I got there fine.  I drove the van perfect there.  Perfect.  No, you guys didn't even see me driving, so how can you make any comments on it?  Because I've heard.  No, but not, you didn't, yesterday you were not with me in the van, so you can't make  any comments.  I drove perfect there, and then I get there, Big Kev says, you know what, I think it'd  be better if you parked up on the curb in front of GameStop.  So, he started directing me on the curb, and I just didn't cut the wheel right.  Didn't cut the wheel right. 
[00:16:00]  You're backing up the curb.  No, I didn't back up.  I was doing forward.  You were going forward, and you hit this?  Yeah.  Didn't you see it right next to you?  It was on my blind side.  Blind side?  It hit the mirror.  How is the mirror your blind side?  I'm stunned, but it hit the mirror.  That's got to be the part of the vehicle that you see the most.  The mirror.  Other people hit your mirror.  You don't hit your own mirror.  It hit the back of the mirror, not the front of the mirror. 
[00:16:30]  It doesn't matter.  It's a pole.  It's a pole in front of your truck.  It went like this.  Yeah, that's the front of the mirror.  No, it hit the back of the mirror and pushed the mirror to the rear.  How is that your blind spot if it hit the mirror?  Anything that hit the mirror would be in plain view of you in the driver's seat.  I had my sunglasses on, and I wasn't looking.  Look, I think he was going forward.  I was going forward.  You were going forward.  So you had to have your...  Stop it!  Stop it!  Somebody said punch the gas because I wasn't making it over the curb, so I punched the gas. 
[00:17:00]  Punch the gas!  Thank God someone didn't say run over some pedestrians.  I heard somebody say punch the gas.  I thought you were going to take his job.  Hey, you've got to give me his job.  Yeah, you can take it.  No problem.  You have a lot of experience driving cars in tight areas around cement poles.  Have you ever smacked into anything down there?  No, no.  See?  Look at that.  Imagine Spaz.  Imagine Spaz working in the parking garage downstairs.  Oh, please.  People would be like, what is this?  I didn't know it was my blind spot.  I came out of the corner. 
[00:17:30]  I was fucking...  I'm sorry, baby.  Spaz wants to bring in paint and paint the damage.  I'd paint it and it'd be good as new.  It would not.  What about the dents?  There is no dent.  It's dented.  I saw it last night.  How do you know they weren't there before I got the van?  Oh, and cleverly right under where the new abrasions are.  That van was in good shape.  All right.  If you're going to play that game, hold on, hold on.  Rod, Rod, Rod.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:18:00]  You got a tape of the crash?  Yeah, we mailed...  Me and my brother were there.  We had a camcorder and we mailed the tape in today.  You saw the whole crash?  No, we saw it from when he pulled up onto the sidewalk.  Now, number one, he pulled up onto the sidewalk on a strip mall.  I mean, I don't even know how he fit the van.  There's about three feet of roof.  Why don't you just leave it in front of the sidewalk?  Because Big Kev told me that it's got to be in front of GameStop.  So I did what he said. 
[00:18:30]  Literally, he was almost through the window.  He was almost through the window.  You're like one of those old ladies driving.  It was hilarious.  I stopped your time.  Anyway, so we had the camera out and he's like bent over and it's like his butt in the camera's face.  And he's looking at the thing like, wow, what do I do?  And I mean, I've been listening to the show and I always thought it was like Parsley and Act.  And I'm like, no, it's real.  It's real.  It's Spaz.  And you can hear me laughing in the background.  It is so great. 
[00:19:00]  I can't wait to see the video you got.  Spaz, can I ask you something?  Yeah, it's not just a little scratch.  And he tries to open the door and a piece of molding falls off.  Right, right.  Thank you.  Bye.  I can't wait to see that tape.  I've got to ask Spaz something.  If you could come back here to Exhibit A, the photographs on the NEW website, see right here and here.  I see.  Now, this is the plastic door molding that keeps doors from dinging you in the parking lot.  A lot of the SUVs and vans have them now.  See that?  That can't be painted.  But I want to know how, if you hit the mirror, the door and this, right in this area, how did the running board back here get damaged? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that's almost impossible.  Did you roll over a cliff?  And over here, the part of the door, they didn't get that either.  There's more damage over here.  How did, if it happened right here, how did it get damaged back here?  Well, like, as soon as I felt the bump, I just cut the wheel the other way and it moved forward just a little bit more.  So you felt the bump, you cut the wheel so it wouldn't hit where it had already just hit. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And then you kept going forward and it hit further back?  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Scott Colombo's in the studio.  He does all the fine internet stuff for us for the NAW website.  You saw Spaz leave the garage yesterday?  Yeah, I saw Spaz leave the garage yesterday.  He was flying out of the garage and just almost slammed into the person in front of him when he realized that people were stopped in front of him. 
[00:20:30]  Whoa, this is dangerous.  We ought to give him one of those driving tests like they gave Marsha Brady and Greg Brady, you know, with the cones and stuff.  It's not a bad idea.  You sound like a really bad driver.  I'm a good driver.  I drive every car all the time.  What's the most of us?  Rain Man, you are a bad driver.  I'm not a bad driver.  I drive my own style of driving.  On style.  The Gonzo style.  The Gonzo style.  I drove with this idiot out to the Coliseum last month.  Yeah.  Nassau Coliseum for the WWF. 
[00:21:00]  I swear to God, we're on the expressway.  As Scott says, even though people are slowing down in front of us, he will hit the gas and come up right up to their ass and then slam on the brakes.  Oh, he's one of those guys.  And you're sitting there with your feet on the floor, boy, like, oh, my God.  And then changing lanes.  Not only does he only do 50 miles an hour, but he changes lanes like he's going through the cones.  Oh, my God.  And he's just like, he's looking back, and all of a sudden, the jerk motion happens, and he's in the other lane. 
[00:21:30]  Spaz, how bad is Erica's car dinged up?  Not at all.  You have no scratches on it.  It is not dinged up at all.  And I drove a U-Haul truck, mind you.  Oh, probably another U-Haul out there with the top ripped back.  All right, Adam, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Look at him.  He got the handle broken.  He got the mirror, the gas.  How can he get the gas broken?  He wrecked everything.  The whole side of this van is, like, scratched up. 
[00:22:00]  It had a brand-new paint job.  Look at the rest of that van.  It's beautiful.  I see this.  I'm blowing up the pictures.  Look what he did, man.  You can see the lights from the garage shining in that black paint because it had just been painted.  I think it all has to do with your commute, Spaz.  You're tired.  Maybe that's it.  It's taking three and a half hours to get to work.  Three and a half hours he commutes to get into work.  Can you believe that?  So who's going to pay for this damage?  It's got to come out of Spaz's pay.  I believe he's now over the $50,000 in Denmark. 
[00:22:30]  Dave, what's going on?  I'm a good driver.  Dave's going to tell us how much damage it's going to cost.  All right, Dave, what do you do for a living?  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Are you Dave?  Dave?  I hear something in the background.  You, man.  You.  Go.  Hello?  Yeah, you.  Yeah.  You're like 12.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're next on NW.  Jim's a body shop guy.  Hello?  You work at a body shop?  Yeah, I work at a body shop.  So do me a favor. 
[00:23:00]  Keep Spaz driving these vans.  We're slow right now.  I could use the business.  You know?  Did you get to see the pictures?  No, I haven't seen the pictures yet.  I got a...  We need a professional to check out the pictures and give us a call.  Give us a little estimate.  Give us an estimate.  I'll check them out and I'll give you an estimate.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Have the bosses piped in yet over this crash?  Not yet.  They probably will when they see the pictures.  Spaz, why are you getting so pissed?  Yeah, you're very defensive on this.  It's like it's nothing.  The pictures make it worse than it really is. 
[00:23:30]  No, the pictures don't show really how bad it is.  Pictures don't do this justice, I got to say.  Don't you understand?  This is not for a day.  Just painted?  That's a dent right there next to the door.  It's dented.  But that was...  I didn't do that dent.  Yes, you did.  I just scraped the wall.  But scraping, putting pressure on metal will dent it.  That dent wasn't done to find yesterday when I gave it to him.  That's dented.  Yeah, Mike who works in the garage, he knows the shape of the man.  The mirror got it worse.  Yeah, well, the mirror got it worse. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, sure.  But the side's dented.  And then look at the running board.  How are you going to fix that?  It's gouged.  There is material removed from it.  They're going to have to get a whole...  There's no painting it.  Yeah, they're going to have to get a whole new piece for that.  We could just cover it with a...  No, man.  It's our show.  We want a nice looking van.  Put what?  And look, there's a piece of a sticker over there that they tried to cover up the running board.  Big Cab, who was there.  Big Cab, did you see the crash yesterday?  Yes, I did.  Kevin, Spaz is almost blaming this on you. 
[00:24:30]  I know.  That's why I had to call in.  Because I can't take the blame for this one.  I'd like to back up a few paces if you wouldn't mind.  When Spaz arrived, there were no parking spaces at the strip mall.  And so what I said was, last week when Jeff Norris and I were doing the sticker stop, we put the truck right on the extra-wide sidewalk in front of the store next to the sticker stop, which is unoccupied at this time. 
[00:25:00]  And then I said, now listen to me and follow what I'm saying and everything will be fine.  Yeah, I know.  Get to the pass.  Let me, all right, well, here's a couple of facts that you might have missed.  One, someone did not yell out, hit the gas.  Someone yelled out, punch it, Chewy.  Punch it, Chewy. 
[00:25:30]  And that's when Spaz, perhaps one might say, over-enthusiastically hit the gas, which launched the car into the truck, the van, into the pillar.  That was the first hit.  Now, we have to get Spaz off of the pillar.  So I say to Spaz, put it in reverse.  Spaz puts it in reverse and cuts the wheel the wrong way towards the pillar.  And that's when, perhaps, a little other scraping damage might have occurred. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my dear, sweet God.  Can you believe me?  That's not a experienced driver.  No, you're right.  See?  Oh, yeah, like it happens every day.  You go in between two pillars at a three feet apart.  Well, then, you know something?  If you are doing it and it doesn't happen every day, wouldn't you be so extra careful that nothing would happen?  Or you wouldn't try it.  You just say, you know what, I can't do that.  I'm just parking it right here.  What did it matter?  You didn't need to be right in front of the place.  The whole parking lot was packed with our listeners. 
[00:26:30]  I got to hear from a body shop guy because I swear, the running board would have to be replaced  to get this thing in the condition that it was before this happened.  The running board has to be replaced.  There's no way to remold a piece of the running board.  It's like a plastic thing, and there's a gouge taken out of it.  The side view mirror would have to be replaced.  Side view mirror, replaced.  That dent would have to be taken out, and three panels would have to be painted. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  It's got to be at least two grand.  And you don't just paint the damaged area after you get the dent out.  You have to paint an entire area around it to blend it in properly.  What about the dent on the driver's side?  That wasn't my fault.  There's a dent there.  How come nobody got in trouble about that one?  Where's the dent on the driver's side?  Nobody took a picture of that one.  There's a dent on the driver's side.  When did you do that, Spaz?  I didn't do that.  That was there when I got it.  You're going to have to take the blame for all the dents. 
[00:27:30]  Lewis.  Oh, God.  I can't believe this.  Oh, no.  This dumb douchebag.  Hey, hey, hey.  Spazzy Wonder.  Did you have your dark glasses on, Spazzy Wonder, when you were driving the vehicle?  Did you have your seeing eye dog running in front of the vehicle telling you where to drive?  What the hell's wrong with you?  He was wearing dark glasses.  Oh, Babo, Babo, is that a handicapped lady standing there?  How the hell with it?  I'll back up.  Oh, my God.  What about the dent on the other side where I slammed my head after I realized what I did? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Guys, you're killing me.  This guy can't be real.  There's nobody this funny in real life.  Lewis, the funny thing is we all had a huge meeting before we decided to let Spaz go to the Wow Sticker Stop.  Uh-huh.  Huge meeting.  Like, you think it'll be okay.  You think he'll get there.  You think he'll, you know, not get lost.  And at what point did you smoke enough reefer to say, yeah, that would be a good idea.  Yeah, I swear.  Well, that's the guy who got people piss on his head. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, let him drive the vehicle.  It's just like the Brady Bunch episode where Greg was going to work for his father.  Oh, my God.  Taking the blueprints.  Stevie Wonder could drive better than he does.  And he screwed it up.  In fact, maybe you should have Stevie Wonder do the next Sticker Stop.  Hey, Spaz, look how you drive the vehicles, man.  Stevie, how do you do it?  I've been watching.  Oh, my God.  Let's make a point.  What's happened there has nothing to do with driving.  I got there fine.  I got there at 4.30 exactly, which is more than Earl can do. 
[00:29:00]  And second of all, nobody, it, everything.  Spaz, everyone gets to the point where they have the accident.  Right.  Everyone gets there.  It's not like, whoa, thank God I didn't get to the accident.  Right.  I got there, yeah.  You got there to the accident.  But what happens is it's not a normal driving thing.  People don't normally drive through two pillars every day.  Yeah, I know.  Only Spaz.  I was following somebody's advice.  Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.  Hey, Spaz, Spaz, pay attention, Spaz. 
[00:29:30]  Every night I park my car in a garage in my building.  There is about a foot of space combined between both sides of my car, which means with the  mirrors, there's maybe three, four inches on each side.  Spaz, I've been driving for 15 years.  If you blindfolded me and stuck a pipe off my ass, I could park the vehicle better than  you do, you dumb dickweed.  Figure out how to park a vehicle, dickweed.  Oh, my hair was all poofy, I wouldn't drag it. 
[00:30:00]  Goddamn, Lou.  Guys, you're killing me.  You're killing me.  Nothing could be this funny.  Hey, Spaz, maybe you should have put Spaz at the site of the explosion yesterday.  Then his poofy hair could have absorbed the radiation.  Hey, baby, my hair was poofy.  I couldn't drive.  I'm sorry.  Now I know why, by the way, now I know why that dickweed takes the train every day. 
[00:30:30]  Baby won't trust him with the freaking car.  Baby, that's why.  Handicapped people three feet tall could drive.  You dickweed.  All right, Louis.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Please, somebody shoot him now so he won't procreate and there won't be little Spazies running  around.  No, it sucks.  Louis is hilarious, but Spaz refuses to put him through on the show.  I know.  Because he calls every day to abuse Spaz.  Oh, yeah.  And Spaz hangs up on him.  The only time we get him on the air is when Spaz is in here and someone else is screening 
[00:31:00]  the call.  Bob from Jersey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let me get this straight.  You let the guy you call Spaz who believes in cancerous live wires, giant mosquitoes,  as well as the famous Cancer World Series conspiracy theory, drive the van and you're surprised  of what happened.  Hey, ONA, just saw the damage to the van.  I work for a dealership that has a body shop.  Guess what?  That running board alone, he looked it up, will cost you at least three grand to replace.  It's a piece of plastic. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, well, so?  It's got to be specially made.  That running board runs the entire length between the wheels.  And it's sectioned off like an end section, middle, front.  And to replace it, three grand.  That costs a lot of money, guys.  Yeah.  This guy, Anthony.  Yes.  You took pictures of the van at the sticker stop?  Yes, I was there.  I spoke to Kevin.  I walked up and he saw my shirt.  I'm a damage appraiser for an insurance company.  Oh.  All right.  So give us the estimate. 
[00:32:00]  Well, I'm faxing it to you right now as we speak.  I wrote it up.  Go get it.  Go get it.  Okay.  Let me see.  I'm putting it through right now.  And, yeah, he pulled me aside.  He said, you're an appraiser?  And I actually took a couple of pictures.  And, hey, listen, that wow really works.  I mean, until the cops showed up.  Yeah, yeah.  It was pretty cool.  I'm sending it over right now.  Do you have the fax machine there?  Hold on the line.  We'll take a break and we'll get your estimate on the radio next.  How's that?  Hold on.  Sounds good. 
[00:32:30]  Opie, one of the TWA Flight 800 investigators checking in.  Wants to know if Spaz can come down with some red and white paint to fix the crash damage.  Oh, brother.  All right, Ed.  Want to take a quick break?  Yeah, then we'll get the estimate and see what the deal is.  And we'll move on.  See you there.  All right.  Powered by.  Insert new show here.  Pawned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW New York. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  That's not funny.  Hey, what?  You didn't hear that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, that one.  Wait, I've got to hear this again.  I thought NW was powered by Opie and Anthony, Anthony.  Listen to what they put together.  Powered by.  Insert new show here.  Pawned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW New York.  Easy.  Wow. 
[00:33:30]  Easy.  Anyway, Anthony.  You're listening to the most interactive radio show in America.  Yeah.  A lot of people going over the pictures of the WNEW Wow, Opie and Anthony Wow van that was  damaged at the Wow sticker stop yesterday.  Very damaged.  Yeah.  Damaged by Spaz.  Uh-huh.  As he tried to circumnavigate the parking lot of a sticker stop yesterday.  Huge parking lot, one pole, Spaz found the pole. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Hit a big cement pillar.  Just scraped the hell out of it and dented it and ruined the running board.  And then he backs up and does more damage.  Does more damage.  He's trying to get away from the pole.  Well, this guy.  Well, yeah, let's get Anthony back on the line.  Yeah.  Anthony's faxed in an estimate.  Anthony, what do you do for a living again?  I'm a damage appraiser for an insurance company.  And you just happened to be at the Wow sticker stop.  You took some pictures and you estimated the damage, right?  Well, I heard about it and I said, I got to see this. 
[00:34:30]  So I ran up and they pulled, actually, they pulled me in because they saw my shirt.  And it said damage appraiser on it.  So I kind of got right up to the front, got my stickers.  And they said, well, what do you think?  And Spaz was putting stickers over it.  So I'm lucky enough to get pictures before he did that.  But did you get my estimate?  Yeah.  Now, on the bottom, it says add in replacement running board.  Yeah, that's a two-piece running board.  There's a small section in the front and then the longer section goes across the whole length of the vehicle. 
[00:35:00]  That's why it's only $152.  So it's a two-piece running board.  But you are right.  They can't be repaired.  They have to be replaced.  Okay.  So the total damage done to the van?  Net total.  What is it?  $1,057.57.  There you go, Spaz.  And you think you can just get some paint and everything will be okay?  $40.  Paint.  You're going to paint it yourself? 
[00:35:30]  As punishment, I guess.  Spaz, you can't just paint it.  How are you going to paint it?  It's not a wicked fence.  Let's ask him.  How do you paint a car?  Give us damage.  That's the whole way, the whole procedure to painting the van.  Yeah.  It has to be repaired properly or else it'll just, it'll look terrible.  Yeah.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  Give me the entire thing.  What would you do?  From start to finish.  Okay.  Well, you see, because you have the letters, you know, wow, paint that on things.  So what you would do is you put a piece of tape to, so you have your line, so you don't  paint over the, you know, so you have. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  We understand.  That's the first thing you would do.  Yeah, lay down the paint.  No, I'm talking about you, you walk up to the van.  Yeah.  What do you have with you?  I have my paintbrush.  Paintbrush?  Oh, it'll be a paintbrush.  Okay.  You have a paintbrush and what else?  Paint.  Okay.  And where are you getting the paint?  Probably like a local hardware store.  A local hardware store.  Okay.  Yeah.  And you have the paint, the paintbrush and what else?  And a roll of tape.  A roll of tape.  Yes.  Now, what's the first thing you do? 
[00:36:30]  I lay down the tape so I have everything lined up.  You lay down the tape to, to, to, to what?  To, to, to, to freaking re-taught.  To make sure that there's a straight line still.  Huckleberry spaz.  A straight line for what?  A straight, so, so, so, like, you know how, like, you make a block letters so I don't go  over the letters, you know, just lay.  You, wait, screw all that.  Okay.  I can't get past the, you honestly think you could just paint it with a paintbrush?  A paintbrush, don't you?  You can't be that stupid.  Hey, guys.  Do you think that's what they do at the, the, the body shops? 
[00:37:00]  You said that it was just painted.  Guys, can I get in here a second?  You better add another 500 to undo everything he's going to do.  We love it when they, when people try to fix them themselves first.  Yeah, de-spaz it.  Oh, man.  You don't paint cars with a paintbrush.  With a paintbrush.  So, the first thing you do is start taping over, what, the dirt and the abrasive that  is still on the dent?  That's what you do?  No, no, I tape over.  How are you going to get the dent out before you paint it with the paintbrush?  Well, if there is a dent, you can just take a little hammer and bang it on the other 
[00:37:30]  side.  On the other side!  How are you going to get to the other side of that?  Spaz, but a few goes body shop.  I know.  And there's people in their cars like, this can't be real.  Trust me.  It's as real as it gets.  It's as real as it gets.  500 people saw it for themselves yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Leonardo da Vinci checking in.  I wish I was still alive to get some painting pointers from Spaz. 
[00:38:00]  Spaz is going to be like, all right, it's our van.  We can do whatever we want with it.  Let's get a little alizarin crimson right here.  We're going to put a happy little tree over this big dent.  There we go.  Maybe a little waterfall.  All right, so, Anthony, you're saying $1,056 to get the van fixed.  Yes, at least.  And then you have to send it out to be re-striped and lettered with all your logos on it.  I don't know how much that's going to cost.  So you could probably add another $200 to $300 on that once you sublet out the striping. 
[00:38:30]  Someone recommending Spaz, maybe crayons.  You could just get a box of Crayola with a black crayon.  Oh, man.  Anthony, I guess we're going to let you go for now.  Okay, thanks.  It feels good to contribute.  Oh, well, thank you.  Syndication when Opie bangs Patty.  Thanks, guys.  If that's what it takes, I think we're going to be a one-station show.  All right, man.  Later on, man.  Bye.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:00]  So you get a paintbrush, and you start slopping paint on it.  Yeah, of course, but staying in the line.  Ah, well, staying in the line, Opie.  Yes, of course.  With black paint that you just pick up at a hardware store.  Do you know how many different types of black there are for cars?  What if the blacks don't match up?  And you know something?  You're not going to find an automotive black paint at a hardware store, and it cannot be  applied with a paintbrush, and it has to be.  But a spray gun.  Oh, my God.  A spray gun.  You're on to something there. 
[00:39:30]  Terry, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I blew up the picture on the net.  I made it into a BMP, and take a look at a section underneath the wheel well.  The damage goes below the skin there.  That's all the way into the wheel well.  You're looking at a lot more damage than that.  Oh, yeah.  Take a look at it.  If you manipulate it a little bit and blow that section up, that whole area there is  buckled into it.  So that whole fender piece has to be replaced, not just the skin.  You can see kind of where the door meets the front fender, right? 
[00:40:00]  Exactly.  In there.  Why do you guys keep this idiot?  I don't know.  First he splooges on your couch.  Now he ruins your van.  Shoot him.  It is truly, truly amazing.  Mack from Jersey.  Can of paint, $25.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Mack from Jersey.  Can of paint, $25.  Roll of tape, $5.  Paintbrush, $3.  Listening to Spaz explain, priceless.  The next time you let Spaz drive the van, make sure to install a second brake on the  passenger side like a driver's ed vehicle, and slap a big yellow student driver sign on 
[00:40:30]  the back.  You're so stupid.  Oh, boy.  Why don't we get Spaz together, can of paint, and try to fix the damage, Anthony?  Oh, that would be really funny.  What do you think?  Why haven't we heard from the bosses?  Yeah.  Will Pip talk to us about this?  I'd really like to know.  I am so amazed that you think you could just paint it with a paintbrush, and then that would 
[00:41:00]  be the first thing you would do.  You wouldn't clean the area off?  What is there to clean?  Look at it.  What is there to clean?  When you paint something, it has to be totally spotless clean.  You go over it with a certain type of alcohol to get any road grime and oil off of it, or  else the paint just chips away.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I'm a cop out here on the island.  Spaz has 10 days to report this accident to motor vehicle. 
[00:41:30]  Is that true?  Yeah, if the damage is over $1,000, he's got to do that.  Your insurance is going up, pal.  My insurance?  Yeah.  What, car insurance?  Yeah.  I don't have car insurance.  You're an idiot.  You don't have car insurance?  I'm not insured.  I just have a driver's license.  I don't have a car.  I use my girlfriend's.  Well, you've got to be insured to drive that vehicle.  Just because she's insured and you're driving her car doesn't mean you're a car.  No, it's under his insurance, under her insurance. 
[00:42:00]  Well, it's going to be, no, it's going to be under the station's insurance.  Yeah, the station's insurance will go up.  We know that, but I'm curious.  When he drives Baby's car, it's under her insurance.  Right.  So if he screws up, her insurance goes up.  But I never had with her car.  Of course not.  Now, Jeremy's in the studio.  Jeremy, have you seen any of the damage?  I've not yet seen all of the evidence.  Perhaps you could take a look at some of the pictures.  First, we get a little overview of the van.  Look at that beautiful van. 
[00:42:30]  Here, here, here, the mirror.  Back here, there's some more damage here.  And he seems to think it's nothing.  And he's going to go to the hardware store, get some black paint and a brush,  and just paint it up.  Yeah, how about a Sharpie?  Yeah, or some black tape, just sort of put it right over there.  We have an estimate that just came in from a guy that was on the scene.  The damage, and this is real, $1,057 worth of damage to the brand new painted wow van. 
[00:43:00]  Oh.  So, uh, we're just wondering, what's the protocol?  How does this get taken care of?  Do you fire him or do it?  Who pays to get it done?  Because we can't have a piece of crap looking van.  Normally, I suppose, whoever did something like that would put it on their credit card.  Ah, well, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Unfortunately, that's just about $1,053 more than he has on the card.  How much credit you got on your card left?  $4.36.  Pretty much?  That'll cover the paintbrush.  $4.36.  How much was your credit line?  $5,500.  What do you have to show for it?  Nothing.  Boots that you can't walk in?  My new home.  Your new home.  It's not a home.  You're renting.  You're renting.  Renting.  So what do you have to show for it?  Nothing.  Yeah.  Rent.  Rent.  You paid rent. 
[00:44:00]  I recall.  You paid rent with your credit card?  All $3,600.  The first month, the security.  Security and last month.  Do you know you're paying 19% interest on your rent?  And that was a cash advantage, I think, that.  Yeah.  Oh, then you're talking probably closer to 24% interest on...  You will be paying off your first and last month's security.  By the time you pay that off, you could have lived in Trump Towers.  Right.  The St. Regis.  St. Regis.  With the butler ironing your heavy metal shirt. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Unbelievable, Spaz.  Jumbo.  Yeah.  What's up?  How you doing, fellas?  Great.  Listen, why don't you save yourself some time and have all your future sticker stops at  the body shops?  That's a good idea.  They could just repair the damage as it happens.  Yeah.  You kill two birds with one stone, you know?  That's funny.  Thank you.  Syndication never, y'all.  All right, y'all.  Rock.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, you're next on N.E.W.  I can't believe this idiot.  He sounds like Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  I can fix it. 
[00:45:00]  I got a real awesome tool set, baby.  I didn't know I was going to hit it.  The pole was eons away.  Which way did he go, George?  Is he stupid?  Yes, he is.  Someone says we should paint little numbers on the van first before Spaz paints it.  That'll be more his speed.  All right, Brian.  Oh, later.  People want to know if the invisible man was injured in the crash.  No, he was fine.  A little whiplash.  And Tom from Farmingdale?  Yeah.  Too bad Spaz wasn't there when JFK was shot. 
[00:45:30]  He could have put the president's head back together with makeup.  He's freaking tall.  He's going to fix it with a paintbrush.  All right.  Enough on that, obviously.  We're going to make a little lake right about here.  Yeah.  Wendy.  I just had to say to Spaz, definitely a good driver.  Definitely.  All right.  Definitely a good driver.  Definitely a good driver.  All right.  Good.  And maybe I'll wow him again.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to take a break. 
[00:46:00]  Enough on Spaz and his crash.  All right.  The captain of the Titanic calling up wants to know if Spaz has a patch kit.  All right.  And let's regroup.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, we've got to go back to Friday's show because it was unbelievable. 
[00:46:30]  And we've got some audio clips of the mess that was going on in here.  Yeah.  Ron Jeremy was in.  And we had a couple of U2 tickets.  Right.  Very hot ticket, Opie.  And Patty, who comes on this program, she's a 46-year-old virgin, never had sex.  She says it's because of her religious background and upbringing.  I just think it's because no one would ever.  And she just, you know, she's very shy. 
[00:47:00]  I just never had sex before because I'm looking for the right man.  I don't just want to catch a disease.  I want to meet the right guy.  So I could have sex with him and not worry about being used or called a slut or nothing like that.  I need a nice guy that I could meet and maybe go out.  And after six months or so, we could start getting intimate. 
[00:47:30]  But until then, I'm not going to have sex with somebody that just wants to have sex for the sake of having sex.  And just babbles like that endlessly.  That's her.  I know.  So we invite her down.  It's her in a nutshell.  No, here's me in a nutshell.  How'd I get in this nutshell?  So we invite her down to win some U2 tickets.  Yeah.  If Patty's listening, she might as well call the show because we've got to find out how the U2 show was. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  So Patty, 46-year-old virgin, was here Friday.  Ron Jeremy was in the studio.  We put a pair of U2 tickets down the front of Ron Jeremy's pants.  Let me tell you something.  Stalker Patty has done nothing in her life sexually.  Never touched, never saw live man junk in her life.  She's never touched it, obviously.  And never had anybody touch her down in that nether region.  Never French kissed, nothing.  No.  The only thing she got, she got filled up once by our pal here, Jim Norton. 
[00:48:30]  Here on the show.  She said, well, I make you horny.  So you've got to understand how sick she is like this because she waited 46 years.  She's been waiting for the right guy to come along to touch her intimately.  And who's the first guy that does it?  Ron Jeremy.  Porn legend, Ron Jeremy.  Ron Jeremy.  What a professional he is.  You could catch something just from his rings.  The best, though.  I mean, every girl has a price. 
[00:49:00]  Even Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  We said Patty.  I mean, we should tell everyone.  You two are her favorite band of all time.  I like the edge.  She pleasures herself to the edge.  We got that out of her one day.  She doesn't do it often, but there are a few times we asked her if she lays back and  maybe her fingers start wandering.  Who does she fantasize about?  Because she's a stalker of Opie, really.  So I thought maybe she lays back and thinks of Opie.  But she's so effed up in the head that she said,  I can't fantasize about someone with a girlfriend.  And Opie's got a girlfriend, so I can't fantasize about him. 
[00:49:30]  But the edge I could fantasize about.  I think the edge is married with kids.  But I don't know him.  But he has some kids, too, right?  No?  All right.  But I don't know him, so I could fantasize about him.  I know Opie's girlfriend, so I can't fantasize about him.  But shut up.  Shut up.  I'll cave your head in with a friggin' spade shovel.  So as soon as we told her that the U2 tickets were down Ron Jeremy's pants, 
[00:50:00]  holy ass.  Oh, she went down there like a champ, like Seika.  Forget about it.  Her hand was right down there.  So we got the audio of her fishing out the tickets from Ron Jeremy's crotch.  Check this out.  It gets better after this, because then we upped the ante.  Patty has never...  Oh, no.  Never.  Never.  She's never had any kind of contact with that part of a man in her life.  Yeah.  All right, Patty.  Now I'm dizzy.  Patty's getting dizzy.  Now I'm dizzy. 
[00:50:30]  I can't believe it.  I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round.  You can't be on a merry-go-round.  I can't believe it anymore, please.  Okay, the ticket's away from you.  There you go.  All right.  You follow my voice.  Hello, hello, hello.  Oh, there she is.  She's on the stomach.  She's searching.  She's now touching Ron's stomach.  Ron's stomach.  Now she's going in his pants.  He's in front of me.  Went down Ron Jeremy's pants.  Ron, how much did she feel? 
[00:51:00]  She glazed along the side of the swamp.  She brushed the side of the legendary Ron Jeremy's swamp.  Here's the bad part.  Oh, my God.  John Tesh at Red Rocks.  She's my favorite fan.  Are you more excited about you two or that you finally touched man junk in all these years?  She's got it right to the side, man.  She's pretty good at that.  I don't think she's a very good one.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I brushed up against something, but I don't know what it was. 
[00:51:30]  It was filet of f***s.  Did she give you a pound of beef and a bucket of balls?  She's done this before.  Tell you what we're going to do.  We're going to upgrade your tickets, Patty, to the front row.  But you want a front row upgrade?  Open wide.  All right.  So there's Patty going for the U2 tickets in the front of Ron Jeremy's pants.  Yeah, we realized, though, that the tickets weren't really put in a place that she really had to search for.  So then we decided her second weakness, which is cash. 
[00:52:00]  Because I'm broke.  I don't make a lot of money.  I work at McDonald's.  They put me on french fries, but now I'm on soft drinks.  So now I'm hoping to get paid more money or I'm going to go to Burger King.  Of course, I'm trying to get a job at the Hard Rock Cafe, but they keep telling me to come back.  And I come back and they never tell me if I got the job.  But I need more money.  Hey, I'm shooting you. 
[00:52:30]  I'm going to shoot you.  She's so annoying.  So we decided $20.  Yeah.  Spending money.  Spending money for the U2 show.  But we would fold it up a little bit and stow it underneath Ron Jeremy's ample yam bag.  Right under the sack.  That famous sack you see swinging back and forth during every bob shot in the porno movies.  The back of the volley shot.  But Patty had no clue.  It was in that area.  No, she'd never really seen it. 
[00:53:00]  I don't think she knew the dynamics of male genitalia to know that, hey, you could hold a $20 down there.  Right?  You could just put it under there.  And now she's going to have to start moving some junk around to get that $20 that I need so bad.  Yeah, these pictures are up on WNEW.com and FoundryMusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com.  So you can play along at home.  Haywood from Yonkers.  If Patty looked like Britney Spears instead of Geddy Lee of Rush,  she would have been banged years ago.  I like it. 
[00:53:30]  Red butt cheddar.  All right.  All right, so I'm here.  And the men who hold our places to be the ones to start mold a new reality closer to the heart,  closer to the heart.  The blacksmith and the artist reflected in the rod.  Forced the creativity closer to the heart. 
[00:54:00]  So here she goes as she tries to find the cash for the first time.  Living in the limelight, the universal dream.  He kind of does look like Geddy Lee.  Good for Geddy, not good for a chick.  Yeah.  Neil Peart on the drums, everybody. 
[00:54:30]  Neil Peart.  He's one of the best drummers I ever worked with.  He makes a lot of money.  I wish I made the money he made working at McDonald's.  I never touched man junk in my life.  On a lighted stage, approaches be unreal.  For those who think and feel guts of reality beyond the gilded cage. 
[00:55:00]  Are you ready to rock, Chicago?  All right, so.  God, I hate her.  So here's Stalker Patty, 46-year-old version, trying to find the cash in Ron Jeremy's pants.  The first try at it.  Patty, and 20 bucks to enjoy the night out of seeing you two.  Yeah.  How about that, Patty?  Yeah, Bono.  All right, hold on, Patty.  Patty is now going down his pants. 
[00:55:30]  Go slow, honey, go too fast.  Her hand is down.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  She just pulled her hand out.  She pulled her hand out like a ferret pinner.  It's there, honey, it's there.  I swear to God, she pulled her hand out of there so quick.  It's under the schlong.  You'll find it.  Patty, go ahead.  You've got to dig it out.  She thought it was a roll of quarters.  Patty, go get it.  You're too low, too low.  Got to go higher.  Too low, go up.  Got to go higher, honey.  It's underneath. 
[00:56:00]  I swear to God, it's like something's nipping her.  She pulls her hand out of there so quick.  Patty, Patty, give Patty the mic a second.  Patty, it's not going to bite you.  Patty, what are you feeling?  What are you feeling right now?  It scared me.  That's what a lot of women say.  She got a grip on it this time.  Did she?  Patty, what does that feel like?  Weird.  Is the 20 still in there?  Oh, it's still there.  It's still in there.  Yeah, it's there. 
[00:56:30]  I love this.  She went back and forth like 20 times where she put her hand in, and then she'd eek.  She'd go eek and pull her hand out like a little rabbit or ferret was nipping her.  Nipping her.  But she didn't get the cash.  No, I couldn't grab it right away.  I didn't know what I was touching.  All right, here's the second try.  She tries to find the cash in Ron Jeremy's pants.  Now that you have your hand on it, honey, it's no big deal anymore.  Yeah, try the undercarriage.  It's like a second fiddle, honey.  Get in there, Patty. 
[00:57:00]  Let's go for it.  Keep going.  Wait, you're close.  A little lower.  A little lower.  Wait, wait.  To the right.  Okay, there you go.  To your right.  Again, other way, other way, other way.  A little lower, a little lower.  She's got her hand on Ron Jeremy's pants.  Keep going a little more.  Keep going a little lower.  Okay, now curl up a little bit.  It's right there.  Go up.  She just pulled her hand out again.  She squealed and pulled her hand out.  She makes contact with Fletch. 
[00:57:30]  All right, hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  What's going on?  I've done a lot of radio shows in my day.  It just really takes the cake.  I know.  All right, Patty.  46-year-old version Patty.  Patty.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  No, it's just spelled something.  It's called Ron Jeremy.  Yeah, he's called all the right spots.  Get him.  It's called Ron Jeremy.  All right, so that was the second try. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Third try, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Stalker Patty going for the money in Ron Jeremy's pants.  All right, here we go.  Get it out of the way, and there's something he's waiting for you.  This is for $20, so you can enjoy the YouTube show.  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  Patty, after you do this, we're going to show you where that's been.  We'll roll a few videos.  You've got to go near there.  You can't escape touching it.  I don't see it.  He's digging around in there.  You've got to get the salon out of the way, honey.  Higher.  Higher.  Go get it, Patty. 
[00:58:30]  Go on.  What are you doing?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  You pulled her hand out again.  Patty.  Don't look at Lisey for her.  I'll put it around there.  No, no, no, no.  Don't make it easy.  Oh, she's got to get it.  She's scared stiffer than...  Patty, Patty, you're going to have to lift up where it's hidden.  I couldn't put it any more blunt to her.  I mean, she had to actually get in there.  Lift it up.  They better not be dumping out of this.  We haven't really described where they'll catch it.  Work them.  You ever see the cane mutiny?  The way Captain Queeg used to work those big metal balls in his hand? 
[00:59:00]  I'll tell you, it's...  Who ate all the strawberries?  How many portions did you have?  Who ate the strawberries?  Old Yellowstain.  Old Yellowstain.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they called me Old Yellowstain.  But I said, we're going to go around.  That's how she's worked.  We went around.  You crossed over the cable, sir.  I didn't cross over the cable.  Strawberries.  Who took the strawberry?  And she's waiting.  She's working.  She's got to work those things.  Finally, I think she gets the cash. 
[00:59:30]  Here it is.  I feel like Guy to Home Russets.  Stalker Patty.  Going for the cash in Ron Jeremy's pants.  All right, she's back in there, Andy.  She's back in.  To your left.  My left is this way.  Yes, go to your left.  That's it.  That's it.  Now, go underneath.  You're there.  Go a little more underneath.  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  You can't avoid it.  Come on, honey.  You have to go underneath.  Come on, grab.  Don't be afraid of it.  It's not going to bite.  Just nibble.  Come on, Patty.  You're real close.  So close.  Keep going.  Patty's like on a top. 
[01:00:00]  Right there.  Under there.  A little more.  Patty.  You've got to use it.  Oh, my God.  She's right in there.  She got it.  She got it.  She got it.  Oh, my God.  My guts.  Money.  You're always.  My God.  Dean from PA.  What is the web address where the picture of Stalker Patty and Ron Jeremy are at?  Well, he said it.  W-N-E-W dot com, foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music dot com. 
[01:00:30]  We have one more clip to play.  I look just like Geddy Lee if someone punched his teeth out and replaced him with Tic Tac.  Thank you, everybody.  Modern day warrior, mean, mean stride.  Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride.  I've got teeth that look like those little chicklets.  I rock.  Look at me. 
[01:01:00]  That was mine does not for rent.  So I'm putting down his arrogance.  It's never quite the fence.  Running out the day's events.  The river.  It looks like a mouthful of baby chicklets.  My smile, all you've got to do, chew up about five pieces of hubba-bubba, mold it into the shape of gums,  and then shove some baby chicklets into it. 
[01:01:30]  That's me smiling.  Life by night away from here.  Change my life again.  All right, sorry, man.  Damien, what's going on?  It's Damon.  All right, Damon, what's going on?  I'm going to burn all my Rush CDs after hearing this.  I'm going to burn them all, set them all on fire.  Why are you doing this to you?  It's my favorite band.  Are you bastards ready to rock? 
[01:02:00]  I wrote this one after I burnt myself in the fry lighter at McDonald's.  I don't know this one.  I don't know this one.  All right.  All right.  I mean, I don't know this one.  So, so far she won the U2 tickets by going in Ron Jeremy's pants and $20 spending money.  We figured she needed another $20.  Yeah.  So this was just beyond horrific.  We had Stalker Patty take $20 and... 
[01:02:30]  Ron Jeremy's taint.  No, she actually, she put the $20 in her...  Down her panties.  In her area.  And it was exactly on the area, like right below.  Right on the seam of the panties, let's say.  It was between the peach and the balloon knot.  Right.  Exactly.  Right there.  And there, and the rule was Ron Jeremy then had to go and get the $20.  And when he pulled that $20 out, she would get it.  Right.  And now here's Ron Jeremy's big, meaty, porno hand. 
[01:03:00]  You know, you could rent to any of the movies or buy any of them, whatever, and see where  that hand has been.  Yeah.  It's been in every orifice that is known to man, woman, child, whatever.  And there it was.  Patty has never had anyone even close to that area.  No.  And the reason, because she says, you know, she's waiting for the right guy.  Ron Jeremy was that right guy?  Ron Jeremy could have taken that $20 in two seconds. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, I know.  How smooth is he, man?  It took about a minute and a half.  And this is some of the best audio you'll ever hear from a 46-year-old virgin.  It was sounds of a rape.  It really was.  It was like she was being sexually assaulted.  It sounded that way.  But she enjoyed it.  Yeah.  God, I wish we could have pulled that off.  That's what I said.  She enjoyed it in the hotel room.  Remember?  Because the girl I was with was screaming just like that.  Of course, I punched her in the face as hard as I could. 
[01:04:00]  And she hit me with the pepper spray.  But I'm impervious to that.  Impervious.  I-P-O-I-P-U.  Imper-  How do I even know the word impervious?  That's what shocks.  Sometimes Mike will shock you.  And sometimes Mike will just punch you in the face until your brain comes out your ear.  I'm full of surprises.  Here it is.  Ron Jeremy going into Stalker Patty's pants.  Yep.  We can save that for $20.  Check this out.  Patty, you ready for this? 
[01:04:30]  All right.  All right, Jim.  Jim, make sure you mic Patty.  All right.  Ron now searching.  Going down on the belly.  He is now finding the panty line.  There he goes.  He is.  Oh, my God.  Whoa!  Patty is freaking out.  I'm not sure yet.  Oh, my God.  Patty can't believe it.  She's in shock.  Ron Jeremy's hand firmly down her pants.  She's buckled over, doubling over her mouth agape. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Have you ever seen Patty like this?  This is unbelievable.  She's what?  Dude, she's enjoying this.  She just had to know.  I think she just owed.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  I'm over there.  He's almost got it, Patty.  He's almost got it.  You got to stand up.  He's almost got it, Patty. 
[01:05:30]  You're going to YouTube.  You're going to have $40 spending money, Patty.  I'm so surprised Ron can't find it.  Yeah, Ron.  You can't find it?  I thought you were an expert at this.  Oh, my God.  I think you lost the ring that time.  She's twitching.  She's twitching.  This is one small step for a minute.  She's on the floor.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, no.  Did you get it?  Yes.  He got it.  He got it.  Oh, my God.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's two tens.  She made change.  That's great, Richard.  What happened there?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Is that great?  That sounded hot.  I like the screaming.  That is great.  That was good.  The only thing missing was the kidney punch and the knockout blow.  That's just the highlights.  We're going to have to replay the whole bit the next time we take off or something, because 
[01:06:30]  it was an unbelievable hour of radio.  I feel like she should have been on a pinball machine.  A lot of people didn't see was to get the smell off his hand, Ron had to shove his fist  into a vomit bag.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Funniest deaf and fit, man, I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, what are you doing?  It's got to be the first time in my life I've ever heard Norton disgusted by a sex act.  Yeah, I know.  A guy that likes tinkle.  There he is.  Oh, she is a mess. 
[01:07:00]  Nice pitches.  Oof.  Yeah.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Kickin' ass, boys.  Keep it up.  All right.  Ernie O. from Jersey writes, I just tuned in.  Are you guys playing audio from the accused?  That's what it sounded like.  I swear I was drunk.  They put me on the pinball machine.  Words of the Prophets are written on Subway Wall's concert halls. 
[01:07:30]  Okay, how you doing, Philadelphia?  Are you ready to rock?  I am.  I had a hot day today.  They put me on burgers, and I don't know how to flip them, but it's a lot more money that  I'm like, how are we doing out there?  Look, I'm dancing across the stage.  Neil Peart.  He's wonderful.  Sometimes I fantasize about him.  Not often, though. 
[01:08:00]  Usually it's the edge.  God damn, this is a long musical intro.  How come I always write songs with very long intros?  Begin the tale of the friendly, nice of a family.  That's awesome.  That song, that's so elusive, and I don't know.  All right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:08:30]  1027 WNEW.  This is a public service announcement.  This is only a test.  Emergency evacuation protests.  May it bear your ability to operate machinery.  Can't quite tell just what it means to me.  Keep out of reach.  Get your reduction, doctor, straight check. 
[01:09:00]  Get your philosophy from above the stickers.  Wanted live without borders.  Wanted live without borders.  Without, all right.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Awful.  A lot of phone calls coming in. 
[01:09:30]  Let's say hi to Danielle.  Danielle, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Oh, Danielle, what's up?  If I listen to you guys drag on Black Girl, I had to call you.  You'll never guess what I watched on the Fox Family Network on Saturday night.  I know what you watched, because I watched about five minutes of it and was just disgusted.  I couldn't believe that at all stations it was on there.  Blazing Saddles, Opie, on Fox Family Channel.  I saw it on the guide, so I'm like, how the hell is this going to work?  I switch it on.  I've seen the edited version of Blazing Saddles a couple of times, and it's really bad.  That was beyond edited. 
[01:10:00]  It was just completely destroyed.  This one was just ridiculous.  Why did they bother putting Blazing Saddles on Fox Family Channel?  Hey, without the N-word and everything else, a good family movie.  Yeah.  It talks about the construction of the railroads and everything.  How the West was won.  It was like a history movie or something.  It was ridiculous.  They were taking other words from other lines that the actors said during the movies  and putting them in place of, like, a nigger or chink or something.  You know, Blazing Saddles, a lot of racist language, but all in a comedy context, Opie.  He didn't even play the Kansas City faggot line either. 
[01:10:30]  That was not even there.  No, you know what it was?  The Kansas City faggot line?  He took, they took one of Slim Pickens' other lines where he yelled horses real loud  and put that in place of faggots.  He goes, I'll pay you boys to build a railroad, not jump around like a bunch of Kansas City horses.  The line is, Kansas City faggots.  Why bother showing it?  Why bother?  Talk about a train wreck.  It sucked.  Yeah.  Duck that, man.  A day's pay for napping on the job.  They really said that?  Yeah.  It was supposed to be chink.  Mm-hmm.  Unbelievable how they, I mean, just don't even take the movie. 
[01:11:00]  Well, I guess they'll be showing porno next, right?  They just take out the language or anything?  Yeah.  It'll be a nice story about how the pizza delivery man wants to help out the housewife.  You know, leave it, leave it a big smile and extra tip money.  Wait, there are some movies that just do not belong on TV whatsoever.  No.  No.  There are some.  You've got to, you know, get a couple of the nasty words out, whatever.  But a movie like Blaze and Saddles, that's the whole movie.  The whole movie is all those rude jokes.  Right.  And if you're going to take those out, it's a bad movie.  Why play? 
[01:11:30]  Thanks, guys.  Okay.  Bye.  Our buddies, Ron and Fez, in the studio, they do the show right before us here in New York.  Yeah.  Um, we, we, we found a letter to, uh, Dan Savage in the village.  This is the village voice?  Yeah.  And we want to, like, um, mostly get, uh...  Fez's feedback?  Well, I don't know, though.  Well, why this story?  Why me?  I've read this before.  I don't understand why Fez should be in here for this story.  Yeah, it's more of, get Ron's opinion?  It's a man's story.  It is a man's story.  A man's man's story.  You know, you're onto something there, Anthony. 
[01:12:00]  Now, how are we going to read this?  Because, um, oh, we'll use code words.  The word that rhymes with lead is in this, uh, letter a lot.  Right.  It's, uh, well, it's what sits on your shoulders.  Only in another context, I think.  I think.  Rhymes with lead.  It sits on your shoulders.  It sits on your shoulders.  On your shoulders.  Mm-hmm.  Not getting it.  It's got a nose on it.  Fred is sitting on his shoulders.  Fred.  Only when I'm constipated.  Oh, God. 
[01:12:30]  That's good.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's read on, shall we?  Sure.  Why not?  I'm a straight man who doesn't get the H word that sits on your shoulders.  Doesn't get it.  The Hummer at home.  So about two years ago, I started going to the gym with a lot of gay members.  And I started getting the, um, Hummers from guys who followed me into the shower.  This guy's a straight guy.  He's married.  Doesn't get the Hummers.  So he goes to gay gyms. 
[01:13:00]  Guys follow him into the shower.  Now he's getting some of the action he was, uh, lacking.  Back when my wife was giving me, uh, Hummers, I had to shut my eyes and think about other  women.  The wife got fat.  Oh, no.  With the guys at the gym, I do the same thing.  Here's my question.  When I first started going to the gym, I would let the first guy who offered, uh, give me  the Hummer.  But lately, I've been getting selective.  I'm a pretty good-looking guy.  Former college athlete.  And lately, I've been letting other good-looking guys, um, do the, uh, deed. 
[01:13:30]  This means I'm paying attention to how the guys who want to, uh, do it to me look.  Which seems pretty homo, he says.  He doesn't want that.  But once the, uh, Hummer starts, I close my eyes and think of Lara Flynn Boyle.  I like him real skinny.  Am I a fag now or what?  Straight guy, gay gym.  He's thinking of Peter Boyle.  Nah.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Um, me? 
[01:14:00]  My opinion here?  Oh, he's, uh...  I'm saying gay.  Yeah, he's gay.  I'm saying gay.  I'm just glad to hear it had a happy ending.  Yeah, that would be nice.  Gotta help the pretty little faggot.  Now, what if you're with your own wife, but you're thinking of Mike Piazza's new haircut?  Right.  See?  Does that make you a bad person?  The blonde bombshell.  You've got some funky-tasting spunk.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  And now, I'm thinking gay. 
[01:14:30]  What do you...  Like, I wouldn't even...  All right, what about the new posters in the city?  Have you seen those?  Which ones?  What is the name of these feds?  They got them out...  They're pulling them out of the Bronx.  Right, yeah.  There was 13 of them in the Bronx, and city officials there pulled them down because they're  too gay.  Too gay?  What did he say?  Yeah, it was two guys in an embrace, and it's like...  I think it says, I'm not gay, I just like having sex with men sometimes.  Right.  And then it has a phone number, you know, for gay issues and AIDS awareness, and that 
[01:15:00]  sort of thing.  Wait a minute.  Wait, what?  So, for those of us that aren't gay, but occasionally, we'll bang our buddies.  Those were pulled down by Infinity Outdoor.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Why bring up the company?  It was our company.  Why bring up that fine company?  It was our company.  Oh, there it is.  Well, I took down those billboards to make room for the Opie and Anthony billboards that  will be in New York very soon.  Same picture.  Just new catchphrase.  No, no, no.  Are they using the same picture?  I'm not gay, but sometimes I whacked at O and A. 
[01:15:30]  No, no, no, no.  I'm not gay, but I sometimes have sex with other guys people don't understand.  Right.  See?  No, I think the guy doesn't understand that he's gay.  If you're having sex with other men under any circumstances, you're gay, maybe prison  rape, but I don't know.  Isn't there a minor amount of times, like eight before you cross into the gate?  There is.  Eight times?  I think eight.  Eight's the number? 
[01:16:00]  That's the cutoff?  Yeah.  After seven, you could go, I got one more, and I'm still not gay.  Was that eight or nine?  I lost track.  Damn it.  Eight or nine hundred.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I never, I've never partaken.  I don't know.  You got eight to go, then.  You're good.  I got eight creepy.  Like a cat.  You got nine lives, baby.  You're in a gray zone at this point.  And use your eight wisely.  Spread them out.  I would think if you're a straight guy like this guy is, and he says he's pretty good looking, 
[01:16:30]  he's a former college athlete, if you're going to get some Hummers, because your wife  isn't giving you any, you'd go and find other women to do.  But is he really gay if he's closing his eyes?  He's gay if he's calling himself a college athlete.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm a handsome college athlete.  In a small Midwestern town.  What is it, he said, some of the guys that he's with are too fat for him?  Well, he's getting picky.  At first, he would just let any guy at the gym do it, and now he's getting a little picky. 
[01:17:00]  Now he's being stressed in line.  Which means he's looking for the hot guys, the guys he thinks are hot now, to give him  mother.  What if you make the other guy tuck himself between his legs?  Are you still gay?  Do the fruit basket from the back?  Does that make you gay?  Are you still gay then?  So it looks like a woman?  Absolutely gay.  So gay.  Maybe the tucker is.  Right.  But you aren't.  Obviously the tucker is.  All right.  What if Nazis have your parents, and they're going to kill them? 
[01:17:30]  Right.  Unless you're with another guy.  Well, if it's part of...  Because the Nazis will give you a choice, it's this matter.  If it's part of the eight, I think it's okay.  Sure.  All right.  So now it'd be okay.  If you get eight.  If you get eight.  Nazis, okay.  But there's nine Nazis.  Uh-oh.  Or at least they're dressed like Nazis.  That could be a problem.  We're not sure what they are.  Right.  They're a lot of leather.  Do you want to hear the advice from Dan Savage?  Sure.  Why not?  He says, I don't think you're...  Dan Savage.  Dan Savage.  I don't think you're a fag.  S-G-G-G.  But no... 
[01:18:00]  What does that mean?  Impossible!  Oh, straight gay guy.  Gay...  Straight guy, gay gym.  Right.  I don't think you're a fag.  Straight gay...  Straight guy, gay gym.  But no doubt, Mr. Heterosexual Men...  But no doubt, Mr. Heterosexual Men do not like to get Hummers from other men.  But what does it matter?  What he thinks.  You're getting a Hummer.  He's not.  You win.  I don't...  I wouldn't think that would be your first option if you're not getting Hummers at home. 
[01:18:30]  To go out to a gay gym and get men to do it.  He's closing his eyes, though.  Yeah.  Does it give an address of this particular gym?  Yeah, where's...  Trying to do research.  Here's the thing, Fezzy.  You're still going to have to do an occasional sit-up anyway.  Make it look like you're there for a reason other than giving Jim a baby.  They don't just have a sauna.  He wants...  He can't go to a gym unless it has an elevator to get him up the steps.  Do a couple of sit-ups and then go into the showers and do some neck-ups. 
[01:19:00]  Would you be the guy?  Would you be the guy in the locker room that would come in and hope that the guy would pick you?  I would have to be first in line.  There's no way.  Oh, poor Fezzy.  I'd never get picked.  He'd be like the elementary school kid in gym class.  Pick me!  Pick me!  He's always a bright maid.  He'd be the last guy picked in the game.  That's rough.  That's funny.  In a gay shower to give the straight guys some time.  That was him then?  That was him then in third grade?  It's him now.  It never got better. 
[01:19:30]  It's just a different kind of dodgeball.  Oh, God.  Balls.  Dodgeballs.  Right.  Dodgeballs.  Well, that's it.  I guess we're all done.  There's no one else left.  Let me go to...  Bobby!  Let me go to Bobby.  Bobby, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  I got a comment on this one.  You're like a bricklayer, right?  Yeah.  A bricklayer lays one brick.  Is he a bricklayer?  No.  Same thing.  Yeah.  You do it one time, then you ought to gay.  Play it simple.  Eight bricks.  At least eight bricks. 
[01:20:00]  Eight bricks.  Well, think about it the other way.  It's like that old joke, you know?  Build a bridge.  Do they call you the great bridge builder?  No.  You...  One cup scale.  Right.  And you're off.  Now, Fezzy...  You're on bag.  Yes.  I want to get Fezzy picked today.  Yeah?  Yeah, I want to get him picked for one of the teams.  It's shirts or foreskins.  Oh.  That's right.  I'll tell you what.  If you pick Fezzy on your team, you get four outs.  Same as...  I hate the special rules. 
[01:20:30]  Same as when we played kickball.  Come on.  It just draws more attention to the last one picked.  Isn't that sad?  We'll give your team the extra guy.  The last picked guy.  You can have four outfielders.  We'll have three.  And he was a catcher in kickball.  Just behind the kid.  Kickball catcher.  How sad is that?  It's his most useless position.  Well, you struck out in kickball.  It's embarrassing.  I have a bad knee. 
[01:21:00]  That's funny.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  That's sad.  Hey, Mike.  This guy's a friggin' homo.  That's what's up.  Yeah, the guy in the letter?  Yeah.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Think about it.  I can't believe you guys are even talking about this.  Gee, he lets men do it to him, and you're calling him a homo?  What's wrong with you?  What?  I mean, I don't understand.  Why doesn't he go to a street gym and find another girl?  Why does he go to the gay gym?  Well, exactly.  That's what we're saying.  Jesus.  I don't even know why there's discussion about this.  Think about it.  He's freaking hot guys now.  Dan Savage's whole column is about gay guys doing the Hummers. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  With straight guys.  It's one after another.  Ross, what's up?  Hey, I'm a straight guy, and I used to belong to a gym that turned out to be all gay.  Right.  So one day, I made the mistake of going into the steam room.  I sit down, and two guys come in, and one guy's head bobs down on the other guy, and  I'm sitting there saying, oh, this is something I've never seen before.  And then some other guy comes in.  He sits down, and he starts looking at me like, hey, what's going on? 
[01:22:00]  Maybe there's a signal you've got to give him, like you wipe your brow or something, and  all of a sudden, the signal's being in the steam room.  And maybe if you weren't sitting there with wood, he wouldn't think you were in the room.  The guy is definitely gay.  So, Ross, what do you do?  That guy.  You let the guy.  I hope you're looking in the mirror when you tell him the story.  So Ross goes, ah, what the hell?  Yeah, you know, give me one, because, you know, the joke's on him, because I'm not gay. 
[01:22:30]  Ha ha, I'm not gay, and look what you're doing to me.  Ha ha, faggot.  You pulled you.  No, that didn't happen that way.  All right, but everybody's been out late at night.  I'm just amazed that after seeing the first two going at it, that you were still sitting  there waiting for a third guy to come in.  I wonder how this turns out.  You need to sweat out those rocks?  It really happened quickly.  I mean, Ross, next time, do the math.  I was waiting for a chick to come in.  Do the math.  There's three guys in the steam room.  Two are at it.  You're the loner, and then another guy comes in. 
[01:23:00]  Hello?  He's holding her feet.  Right.  Do the effing math.  All right, when you're out late at night, you pick up a girl, right?  Right.  And you don't know.  Yeah.  You know, you have that thing.  If you're at this three o'clock in the morning, she's dressed like a girl.  She's got the hair.  No.  And you don't ask.  Right.  Does that make you gay?  Absolutely, because there is never any question.  There is not one tranny walking around that could ever fool me.  Never.  You could always tell. 
[01:23:30]  This could be a contest, though.  Well, you could always tell that it's a man.  Yeah, we could do it, but every time we've had a tranny in here, without a doubt, you  could just know.  You could so know.  You know something?  There might be three on the whole globe that would be amazing, but for the most part,  anyone you're going to get around here in New York, they ain't fooling anyone, except  Psycho Mark.  We had Psycho Mark sitting in a chair, and this girl guy came in.  And again, he wanted to be fooled.  Right.  Because he's not asking.  You know?  But there's no way.  He put a blindfold on.  Most guys that are with trannies, they know they're with trannies. 
[01:24:00]  Just ask Eddie Murphy.  Yeah.  Let's go to Nick.  Nick, what's up?  O&A.  Yeah.  This is the Afro Show, huh?  Yeah, we love the Afro Show.  We love when Rana Fest come in to help us out.  Guys, this is very, very important.  Yeah.  Are you allowed eight or up to eight?  Oh, oh, you mean eight?  Does eight put you gay, or is it nine puts you gay?  Yeah, man.  What's your eight?  What's your eight?  Yeah.  What's your been eight? 
[01:24:30]  It's two eight.  Is it eight or eat?  Once you've eaten.  Later, guys.  All right, Nick.  Well, I learned something already today.  Yeah, it's interesting.  If you're going into a steam room, make sure there's an odd number.  Yeah.  Unless you want to pair off.  Freaking Ross.  And he sat there.  He sat there.  Those two guys are doing it.  Look, man.  Waiting for the other guy to come in.  Well, the steam room's foggy.  Yeah, right.  I couldn't really tell what was going on.  He's thinking, look, if you're not done with that, I'll finish it. 
[01:25:00]  You eating that?  I'm naked.  I'm in the steam room naked, feeling vulnerable.  Two guys are going at it.  Another guy comes in.  I don't know what to do.  First of all, I'm naked in the steam room.  Okay, right there.  Don't you wear a towel?  Grab the towel.  Anytime I've seen any steam room thing.  I've never been in a steam room like that.  But anytime I've seen one on TV, it's, you know, Major Nelson's in there with Major Healy.  Right.  Dr. Bellows.  Dr. Bellows.  And they're talking about something.  It's all like men in there, but there's no BJs going on. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, but the fact that there's towels and you're all naked.  And some guy's always stretching in front of you.  It's a bad situation.  You see right up the towel, you see that disgusting gamm bag hanging down by a Turkish taffy on a hot summer day.  Anthony, speaking of Dr. Bellows.  Yeah.  What would Dr. Bellows sound like if all of a sudden he was in the steam room and things went horribly wrong?  I thought it was the steam room and all this Major Nelson I saw.  But then I came in and there was a man and another.  And then I looked over here at Major Nelson and Major Healy and his mouth is. 
[01:26:00]  And then I looked and there was a girl, but she turned into a man.  But Major Nelson, and then General Peterson came in and soiled my towel.  Major Nelson.  I love that.  He never knows what's going on.  The guy's perpetually confused.  Loved it.  Now we have to take a break.  Yeah.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:26:30]  1027 WNEW.  This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk.  You can't ignore it.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, if you want in on our stupid radio show, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  It's filled with a bunch of nonsense, this radio show.  Of course.  But we like it.  Nonsense is good.  I hope you do, too.  So, our first female, Amy.  Hello.  We like putting the women right on the radio, so.  Okay.  Well, good to know.  No waiting.  Yeah, no waiting for the ladies, because most of you guys are scared of us. 
[01:27:00]  No.  All right, Amy.  What do you have for the show today?  This is bad.  I was in high school, and I was a freshman.  And, you know, working on being popular.  You know, all the games you play in high school.  And I come home one day, and my mom's like, oh, listen, this is really sad.  I ran into Mrs. So-and-so at the supermarket.  And, you know, her son doesn't have a date to the senior prom.  So, I just told him.  I told her to just tell him to have you go with him.  And it would be great.  You know, he's a really nice guy. 
[01:27:30]  He's like the dorkiest guy in the entire high school.  I'm like, Mom, you can't do this.  Your mom got you your prom date.  I'm like, you can't do this, Mom.  I'm a freshman.  I don't even want to go to the senior prom.  I can't do this.  You know, like, this could ruin my social career.  She's like, no, you got to do this.  This is awful.  My mom used to try to set me up with the bank tellers at her bank.  Oh, that's cute.  That was nice.  And it was always trying to set you up.  You know what's weird about moms?  What they think is cute and what you think is cute is two different things. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there's this lovely, cute little girl at the bank.  And I think you guys would be perfect together.  So, you finally go in with her, you know?  Great, because she can make small talk with your mom.  You're like, ooh, ah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She can make small talk with my mom, so I should be dating her.  Yeah.  It's like, Mom, I'm looking for something more in a hose bag at this time of my life.  My mom was just known for that.  She worked all the time.  So, she was, like, you know, always doing, trying to do extra things to, like, help you  out socially.  She packed my sister's lunch, and my sister comes home crying from school. 
[01:28:30]  She was sent home.  She went to Catholic school.  My mom had packed her lunch.  And you know how you would wrap up sodas in tinfoil?  Yeah.  Wrapped up a can of beer by accident.  My sister got sent home from school.  Rock.  That's a cool mom.  Like peanut butter and jelly and bud.  I never had, I never had the cool lunch.  No.  I was, I was always the guy trying to upgrade my lunch with my pals.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I never wanted to do that, because I was skeeved out by anyone else's, like, mom's 
[01:29:00]  hands touching the food.  Wow.  They'd always, you want to trade this sandwich?  I'm like, ah, you're skeevy mom's hands all over this thing?  Get out of here.  I'd get, like, a, you know, a bruised apple for a snack, and my buds would have, like,  homemade chocolate chip cookies or homemade brownies.  I'm like, come on, man.  Trade.  And I never, I know the horror you went through with the school lunch, dude.  But, especially with the bag.  I never wanted the brown bag.  I never wanted the little brown bag.  I wanted a lunch box. 
[01:29:30]  And every year, damn it, I got a lunch box.  I had my Lost in Space lunch box.  You know, one of my brothers should call up with the thermos, but I remember.  Because you're hitting a real soft spot in my family.  You should just hear what Opie had to go to school with for his lunch.  The bags.  We were so poor.  Yeah, yeah, poor, Opie.  We were so poor.  I'll tell you the story.  Yeah, like Anthony said, everyone has.  You think how embarrassing this is? 
[01:30:00]  It's the Big King Colbert.  I'll tell the story, you ass.  I'll tell the Big King Colbert.  If my brother calls, he'll...  That's great.  How embarrassing.  He would be suicidal to tell the story on the air.  But, basically, like Anne said, you know, all your friends had the cool lunch boxes.  Maybe, like, I don't know, the Brady Bunch lunch box or the Scooby-Doo lunch box.  Yeah.  Open it up.  You got your little thermos in there for your little fruit cup or something.  Right.  And your drink and your sandwich all nice and wrapped. 
[01:30:30]  Sure.  And then if you didn't have the lunch box or you didn't want one, you could go to the  store and buy the little lunch bags.  No, no, I'll explain.  The lunch box were, you know, were given to the kids whose moms really cared.  Right.  Then you had the kids that came in, like you said, with the small brown lunch bag.  You could go to the store and buy a big stack of those.  Right.  I don't know, it cost too much money to get the small brown paper bags for my lunch.  See, we were so poor. 
[01:31:00]  Like Rick, Rick guessed about two minutes ago.  My goddamn lunch.  A lousy peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a bruised apple were.  That's it.  It was just like two little things.  We're in a huge, huge wall bounds paper bag.  The one they pack the groceries in.  And then what was your carrying style? 
[01:31:30]  Would you carry the whole thing or roll it so it's just like the big bottom of the bag  and this huge rolled up?  It gets worse.  It gets worse.  We brought the bags home, home after lunch.  You had to fold them up and bring them home.  Oh, that's pretty bad, man.  So we could put the book covers on our textbooks.  You made them out of the paper bags. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, so like my science textbook had a big, huge wall bounds on the front.  While my friends had the cool Star Trek book covers.  So they were dual purpose, Anthony.  They were used to carry my lousy sandwich and bruised apple to school.  And then we had to bring them home so we could make book covers.  Did it have your name written on it, too?  Oh, thanks. 
[01:32:30]  Because then when you leave that with your coat, you know, you have your whole thing set up.  Yeah, where you have your coat.  Everybody knows it's your bag if your name's on it.  Oh, the big shopping bag.  I knew my brother would call.  He's a bitter man.  Elmo.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Is this a nightmare or what?  Why are you bringing this up?  You know, it gets dark at 4 o'clock.  I'm already suicidal and you have to bring that up.  I mean, we would take these huge, like, King Cullen bags and roll the top down and fold them 
[01:33:00]  and do whatever we could to try to mimic those small little bags.  We looked normal.  But once, I also got a cement bag from Dad.  Wait a minute.  One of those huge cement bags.  We, you know, we were done doing the sidewalks around the house.  Like a Sacrete bag or something?  Yeah, one of those huge bags.  You know, because my dad...  Still on counter in it?  So we put the food in that and rolled it up. 
[01:33:30]  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  It was unbelievable.  Trust me.  My brother says it.  It happened.  It happened.  I'm dying for you.  A cement bag.  This is like the shame of our family.  I still can't go shopping and get a paper.  I always have to go plastic just to erase the memory.  Elmo, you notice how, like, Ed's telling all his horror stories from growing up and I'm  keeping my mouth shut.  I know.  I'm like, oh, my God.  That's like going to a spa. 
[01:34:00]  I'm like, I'm just biting my lip because I don't want to have a nervous breakdown live  on the air.  Come on.  Unload.  It'll make you feel better.  Tell Anthony about the sugar and margarine sandwiches at Grandma's house.  Oh, delicacy.  Why do they feed the kids?  I'm diabetic now.  I wonder why.  Oh, my God.  He is, too.  What did they do?  Well, my grandma had a beach house out there in Waiting River. 
[01:34:30]  And that sounds pretty fancy.  No, it was a nice.  It was great.  It was a great little house.  And I don't know.  She had about, what, 40 grandkids' elms?  At least.  So she would just break out, you know, a loaf of Wonder Bread, just on the table, quick  margarine, all the way down.  She'd bake like 20 sandwiches at a time and then just pour sugar on the butter.  And give it to kids.  And give it to us.  And give it to kids.  Yeah.  Like they weren't wired enough. 
[01:35:00]  And then we'd bounce around.  Bing, bing, bing.  And then we'd go outside to get fried by the sun because we didn't wear sunscreen.  Wait a minute.  They wouldn't put sunscreen on you?  Oh, tell the whole story, man.  Come on.  Kids don't crank getting burned.  All right.  Number one, we'd go swimming in the ocean without any kind of supervision when we're like three.  We'd have no suntan lotion.  We'd be eating sugar.  I mean, it was just so sad.  And then we would be so burnt from the sun that we couldn't move, right? 
[01:35:30]  Right.  And what did we have to sleep in at night?  The army blankets with the sand.  It was like reclining on sandpaper.  Those old, like, army blankets, the real rough ones?  Yeah, those dark green blankets.  And we used to make tents out of them.  And we're talking, we were so sunburned, like our eyelids were red and like our underarms were red.  And we'd have to sleep on top of sand.  And then we'd have to sleep in these army cots with an army blanket. 
[01:36:00]  We might as well have been sleeping, you know, on insulation.  Because it was the same feeling between the army blanket and the sand that happened to be there from the last person that slept in the army cot.  And if it wasn't sand, then it was full of sugar, which has the same effect.  Oh, my God.  That's some upbringing.  It was great, yeah.  It was great.  All I wanted was, like, the lousy little brown lunch bag, little sandwich. 
[01:36:30]  I know.  I practically have to, like, stick people up.  Not for the lunch money, but for their lunch bag.  Like, give me the bag.  The last thing you wanted to do going to school was look different.  Exactly.  I swear to God, you just wanted a conformed fit in so no one would give you crap.  Because the second you try to do something different, you're marked an outcast.  And if you're the big lunch bag guy, people are calling you the big lunch bag guy.  The cement lunch bag guy is even worse. 
[01:37:00]  That's the truth.  But in the winter, like, I wouldn't wear my jacket because I'd use it to camouflage the huge lunch bag.  But now I go home with a cold.  It's just a nightmare.  It was interesting.  All I wanted was a sandwich.  Remember the kid in school, in the cafeteria that might as well have been the drug dealer?  He came in with the little plastic baggie of chocolate for the chocolate milk.  It was like this powder stuff.  And everyone would gather around, man, put a little in my milk, man.  Put a little in. 
[01:37:30]  Well, what you got, man?  What do you have for me?  I'm the chocolate man.  Here we go, kids.  I got chocolate.  And, like, his buddies would all, you know, just I keep a little for my head.  And then I get rid of the rest.  Oh, my God.  The chocolate milk kid, like, rule.  I never got the chocolate milk.  You kidding me?  I remember that.  And he would, like, dole it out to his buddies so that the milk just, it was still like the color of milk, just vaguely brown.  Like, yeah, we're drinking chocolate milk and you suck. 
[01:38:00]  Wow, I do suck.  I tried to trade the bruised apple or the bruised pear for that, but it never worked for some reason.  Why were fruit was a very low commodity on the ladder?  Elms, when we were growing up, why were our apples so damn bruised?  Because they had so much room to bounce around in those cheese in one bag.  All right, Elms.  All right, I'm going to go flip my wrist now.

[01:39:30]  I'll tell you what, I've had swamp ass for the last four hours.  Have you?  Why?  Because it's 98.  Yeah, you get cranky ass.  No, you get swamp ass.  Swamp ass, I understand.  Swamp pimples.  Oh!  Ow!  You've got to watch out.  You don't build up a fragrance back there, you know?  This weather will make you violent.  No, it's going to happen.  No, it's going to happen when you take your underwear off later.  When it's going to happen.  It's going to look like a shoeshine wreck.  Take it off. 
[01:40:00]  Let's see what you got.  So, yeah, we've got some fine looking, uh...  Those are all moms out there, Jim.  Are they really?  This is a mom contest.  Yeah, take a gander.  Yeah, it's the moms that like to have contests.  That's a mom?  That's a mom.  Can you believe it?  Of like 13 and 14-year-old kids.  And those are...  Oh, I know!  Adam Ferrara in the studio now.  How are you?  What's going on?  Adam Ferrara, what's up, bro?  Whose mother is that?  You see that?  You see my mom?  I'm going to get her naked.  Brewer brought his mom. 
[01:40:30]  You know something?  Brewer comes in, and I look and go, Brewer brought his mom with him.  His mom is right outside, and there's things going on out there that, you know, I don't know.  I know my own mother turns this show off.  That's not maternal instincts going on out there.  No.  You see those boobs?  Those are real.  That's in your Paula Poundstone family of mothering.  Rosie O'Donnell mother.  It's unbelievable.  Maybe we got Rosie down here.  Oh, yeah.  That's what we want to see.  Rosie O'Donnell, should I get Rosie down here?  We want to see a flatso.  Please. 
[01:41:00]  Yuck.  So we're going to have those pictures up on WNAW.com.  What will you think?  Is your mom cool with stuff like this?  Oh, my mom's crazy.  Yeah?  She's out of her mind.  Because I'm looking, you know.  And my sister.  My sister's over there.  That's your sister right there, right?  Yeah.  Right on.  There you go.  See, that was an accident.  She's like in her 50s.  I was a little bit.  Oh, you weren't supposed to be born?  Yeah, that was one of them.  You mean it was supposed to be oops, Brewer.  My mom's like 40, 41.  Hey, Brewer, keep your sister away from Adam.  It doesn't seem to stop him.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:41:30]  When did this happen?  What?  He'll date your sister at the drop of a hat.  What happened?  What happened?  You know, you should have a vein running up your face.  You're that big a dick.  It was many years ago, Brewer.  We were hanging out like we grew up together.  Yeah.  And his sister liked me, and we went out.  Oh, that's what it was.  Yeah.  Well, what was it?  Oh, I told you.  No, okay.  Anthony promised me his sister so I wouldn't invade his land.  What do you think it was? 
[01:42:00]  Some kind of arranged thing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You didn't have to accept.  Could have just said.  I asked permission.  I went to the Joe Buck Anthony Council.  The Don.  Look, my intentions are pure.  I mean you with no disrespect.  Were you like the king of the block?  No.  It was just, you know, it was a group we hung out with and stuff.  And then, you know, you could say things like, hey, look, I'm really good friends with your brothers and stuff.  And I don't think it would be appropriate. 
[01:42:30]  But Adam didn't have that in his vocabulary.  I asked you first, and I got a dowry of two sheep.  You dropped subtly like, hey, your sister's growing up.  Your sister's hot.  Don't even think about it.  Yeah, that's what happened.  You know?  She liked me.  All right.  Well, ooh.  See, I thought you were talking about 50-year-olds.  And he hit him with his brothers.  What am I going to do there?  Yeah, you can't even get him with a payback.  I'm sorry.  I got a couple of cousins you can look at.  Louise is hot.  Oh, God bless you.  You go out with my mother, first thing you do is going to get a thank you note from my father. 
[01:43:00]  I swear to God, I asked him the other day, I said, Pop, how's married life?  He goes, ah, it's killing me, but I'm not giving up.  She ain't going to win.  I'm telling you right now.  My dad always said, Dad, how's marriage life?  He goes, put it this way.  My day exists with a pork chop and a good crap.  That's a good thing.  My father's a diabetic.  I go, how you doing?  How am I doing?  Every morning I f*** on a stick.  How do you think my life is? 
[01:43:30]  It's, ooh, I hope it's purple.  It's, you know, it's the little things in life.  I got a crap.  It's the little things in life that make you happy at that age.  My father doesn't even answer the phone anymore.  I go, Pop, don't you hit a phone ringing?  It's never good news.  Leave it alone.  It'll stop.  I got a little big joke.  Hey, Brewer, does your mom smoke pot or what?  No, she never did.  No?  Did your mom?  No.  Did you ever smoke pot or no?  Give a thumbs up or thumbs down.  No?  You're a dirty liar. 
[01:44:00]  I will say this.  Look at her right now.  You see my mom?  Well, we can put her on the air for a sec.  No?  Yeah, sure, Ma.  Come here for a sec.  We'll be nice.  It doesn't matter.  She'll come right back at you.  Oh, really?  Brewer's mom.  Ma, give me her.  Brewer's mom.  Brewer's mom.  How are you?  Do you remember when you got hammered when you were in the city?  She came...  Yeah, look at my mom.  So did my daughter.  No, no.  You got wrecked.  First of all, it's five in the morning.  Yeah.  No, two in the morning.  Two.  What are you talking about?  Ma, it was five in the morning. 
[01:44:30]  Two.  This is what I hear, like...  You know when you were trying to sneak in as a kid?  Right, yeah.  Just praying not to...  This is what I hear.  This is...  Okay, I hear the door open.  I hear this.  I can't get my pants off.  I can't get my pants off.  I can't get so...  She fell out of a cab into a puddle. 
[01:45:00]  You think I'm lying?  Did you not do that?  No, we fell off the curb into this...  Oh, much better.  What's your poison, Mrs. Brewer?  Oh, what do you like?  Martinis?  Martinis.  I started today.  What do you like, the absolute or...  No.  No?  Dry.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I would like straight up, extra dry, just a little vermouth, not too much, and some chinky  food.  Uh-oh. 
[01:45:30]  Who is she calling into the studio?  My daughter that was with me when we fell in the gutter.  Did you both fall in the gutter?  Yes, we did.  Your sister fell in the gutter, too?  Yes, she did.  His sister fell in the gutter.  My sister gets just as hammered.  Really?  She hasn't done it in a long time.  And her husband had to pick us up and put us in the cab.  Oh, my God.  She's like Arthur.  She's 78.  75.  Sorry.  74.  74.  You're 74?  Yeah.  You're quite a firecracker at 74.  I've got to tell you that. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  Show us the moves.  Jim, stop it now.  Well, I met your mom.  We should put your mom...  Oh, I know.  I'll do the party right there.  My mom...  Tear ass up.  My mom, I take her to see Jim Brewer at the Vanderbilt a couple of months back.  She is so hammered.  She's just...  Hey, Jim, I love you.  I love you.  You are the greatest thing.  And she's hanging on him like...  Mom, either take him in the back room or stop right now because... 
[01:46:30]  I would do you.  But you know what?  I don't know if I want to do you.  I would do you.  I would do you.  Oh, that's great.  You'll offer Brewer your mother, but I can't date your sister.  Hey, you did.  Yeah.  Oh, my mother just out of control.  But these two together would probably be quite the item.  Falling out of cabs all over the city.  Now, just one point.  Just one?  Yes.  We managed to get home.  Yeah, that's all that counts.  I fell out of the car. 
[01:47:00]  She couldn't get her pants off.  She couldn't get her pants off.  I had to come in there.  I had to take my mother's pants off.  Oh, my God.  Well, I took your pants off for 34 years.  Jim, she didn't come home after being out.  For 34 years.  Jim, after being out with friends, she didn't come home with dick written on her forehead like you did.  No, unfortunately.  What's on your face?  There's some dick all over your face.  She used to show up.  She knew I'm getting wrecked or like around the corner.  Yeah.  You know, your friend would come pick you up. 
[01:47:30]  Like, yo, man, we'll take a drive around the corner.  Yeah, you got it.  This effort would show up when you are peaking.  You know, when you're like, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Life sucks.  Get out of the goddamn car now.  Get out.  And who are these whores you hit you with?  Oh, no.  Yes, I remember.  There were girls with you?  She hunted me down a pizza place.  These chicks are whores.  Get them out of here.  All of them right now.  Don't look at me like that, Missy. 
[01:48:00]  You're a whore.  Oh, my God.  She's a whore, Norman.  My best friend was Joe, and she's like, and Joe, I'm very disappointed in you.  I'm humping that girl against the wall at James' Pizza.  Think I'm lying?  No, I did do that.  Oh, my God.  This is like a therapy session for Joe.  Isn't it?  What a coincidence.  He said, you're embarrassing me.  I said, you haven't seen anything yet. 
[01:48:30]  This is out in the street.  You know, Queens.  Yeah, very embarrassing.  The brothers are watching, just having a field day.  Oh, God.  That nigga be wrecking out by his mother.  Mom's be wrecking.  That nigga be taken down by his mom, Joe.  Mom be taking that nigga down.  No, she's falling in the gutter.  She's falling.  Oh, snap.  He called that bitch a whore.  Were they whores, Jim?  Yeah, they were. 
[01:49:00]  Mom, how did you know they were whores?  You can tell.  You can just tell.  Yeah, they had that look.  They had the look?  Yeah.  Right, they had that look.  Reputation.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And you were disappointed in his friend.  See, my mother was never disappointed in Anthony.  I expect it from him.  Yeah, I know.  I was like, I was a great thing for Adam to have around  because it made him look so good in the eyes of his parents.  That'd be around him.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And the other one with the tattoos.  Why can't you be like Adam?  Be like Adam.  Adam, I know you're good friends with Joseph, 
[01:49:30]  but please don't take his example with the tattoos.  Right.  Okay?  They look good.  It's fine for him, but not you.  You're not tough.  That's fine.  Put an earring in your ear.  Oh, did he get the earring?  Did you have an earring, bro?  What's wrong?  Mom, what's wrong with the earring?  I didn't care.  Oh, you didn't care?  Cool.  If my son wants to be a faggot, that's his business.  Yeah, my dad did.  Yeah, my dad was not happy when I got...  But he doesn't yell.  He just gives you that look like...  Jesus Christ. 
[01:50:00]  Why didn't you go stick a donkey down your throat and just end the day?  Put on a skirt and put the donkey and the n*** on your chin and let's go round and round.  I'm packing in.  I fought in World War II for this stuff for an earring.  Did you get a tattoo?  You have a tattoo, bro?  No.  Oh, I was too scared for that.  I told my father, I said, you know, I think I want to get a tattoo.  My father said, you better tattoo a new address on your arm because you ain't living here. 
[01:50:30]  You all got that smart-ass remark, you know?  Yeah, we'd like that.  Hey, we were going to ask your mom if she, you know, did you used to smoke the wacky tobacco?  Never.  Never did that, right?  I'm very virtuous.  Yeah.  And you raised a Jim Brewer.  And I raised five bad children.  You were the leader.  You're probably very proud, though, right?  Yeah, I am.  Hey, did you really have a dog named Duffy?  Yes, we did. 
[01:51:00]  Little Duffy.  Little Duffy.  He used to hang out underneath the table.  Mookie?  Mookie.  And Casey?  I'm not going to tell you who I call him.  Mookie Wilson?  Yeah.  Mookie.  Right on.  I'm not going to tell you.  Gee, let me think.  Was he black?  Yes.  Okay.  That's all he needed to know.  No, he was a right fielder.  Duffy.  And you had to clean the crap off of the back of Duffy in the later years?  I didn't do that. 
[01:51:30]  No, no, Jim had to do that.  Before you go out, wipe the crap off Duffy's tail.  And no goddamn drinking tonight.  I'm not.  I'm not.  You would have to say that.  Preface it before you went out.  No, I'm not drinking.  Was he a big drinker there, Mom?  Jim?  I think so.  Yeah?  Out with his friends and stuff.  I never came home drunk.  Well, you know what was cool is that she would be passed out, because you would have two, three  martinis at 10 p.m.  I could be humping someone right on the couch. 
[01:52:00]  My mother would be right next to me.  But I woke up.  My dad's six-pack in.  My dog.  Wiping his ass.  I'm.  Oh, my God.  She wouldn't wake up for hours.  But what would happen is, what would happen is in the morning, my dad, my dad was a sanitation  worker.  So he would get up about 4.35, Dad, and he'd always get up. 
[01:52:30]  And this is where I'd go, hey, jackass, get up, get up.  You know, I just fell asleep a half hour ago.  Still says nice head dick all over my face.  And he goes, hey, last night, were you all effed up?  I go, no.  He goes, your ass.  The car's in the bushes.  Well, your mother wakes up, you jackass.  That was the dead giveaway, man.  Because there have been days you come outside and you go, I did not park my car like that.  You know, and you kind of remember trying to parallel park or something or pull it in 
[01:53:00]  the driveway, and you were really paying attention.  I've got to get a little closer to the curb.  I'm good like this.  Why?  You come out, you're in the middle of the road, or your car's backed into the curb.  I like two feet away from the curb on an angle.  It's like, well, you couldn't even straighten it out.  There's days you come out, and that's not my car.  Not only is it parked all left up, that isn't even my car.  In the middle of the night, you hear, what the hell?  What's your dick? 
[01:53:30]  Nice pork job, dick.  You come out.  Someone moved it, man.  You got it easy.  My father used to go to bed when I had to be home at 11 o'clock.  I said, Pop, I'll be home.  He goes, you're going to be home at 11 o'clock.  I'm setting my alarm.  I'm going to bed.  I'm setting my alarm for 10.59.  You better turn it off before I do.  That's a good idea.  Look at that.  A little late.  That is a good one.  Yeah.  Well, we used to, well, the first time drinking it, she was up. 
[01:54:00]  You know, like, those nights you just go out, and it just happens?  Yeah.  It's just like, oh, my God, it's 4.30.  What happened, man?  Where's my pants and my money?  Who's the dirty Mexican chick?  She's a whore.  So, yeah, I came home, and the first night, I really went drinking.  I came home, and it was like 3 in the morning, and she was waiting at the door.  You know, this was a friend's field day. 
[01:54:30]  His mom's off.  What a faggot.  What a faggot.  What a faggot.  And the whole time, she's yelling, Jesus, Jesus, God, this is what I'm raising the beans.  My dad was cool.  He's like, please, he don't know where he's at.  Wait till the morning for Christ.  He's all left up.  Give me one of your White Castle's ass.  It's kind of traumatic for a mom the first time you come home all left up.  Well, he was the youngest, and I went through that before with quite a few of them. 
[01:55:00]  As she looks at her daughter in the corner, my sister drove, my sister, which my mom didn't  find out until like a year, or did you find this out yet?  My sister.  Oh, no.  Wrecks the garage door?  Yes.  She tried to sneak out with the car.  This is a nice head move, Doreen.  She gets in the car with her friends, and she's not sure how to start the car yet.  Whatever.  She starts the car, starts rolling too far.  Car starts coming.  She doesn't know.  She panics.  Right through my garage. 
[01:55:30]  Right through the garage door.  Nice way to sneak.  The ride shore comes down, and she's like, I didn't know what happened.  It's just broke.  It's just three, four more teeth.  Yeah, it's just broke.  You fell for that once about two years ago.  I fell for it for a while, and then I thought, oh, no, they're lying again.  Isn't it fun when years later, you come forward with some of these stories to your parents?  All of a sudden, your brain says, they're lying.  Yeah.  That's right.  You're right.  Oh, if you think I'm a big Met fan, which they do suck. 
[01:56:00]  It's hard.  What do you think of Piazza's new hairdo?  I have a hard time defending myself against the diehard Yankee fans.  Dude.  Give me an F.  Give me an A.  Give me a double G.  Must I continue?  Nice hair.  D-double-E-K.  D-dick.  Come on.  Man.  Well, anyway.  Help us out. 
[01:56:30]  Get that hair back to normal.  First time we moved down to Florida in like 86, 87.  First time I come down there, I moved back to New York.  First time I come visited back, you know, we got our daughter.  The Mets are playing the Cubs.  I don't realize our neighbor is from Chicago.  Right?  What was she on?  What was whoever?  Tom and whatever her name is.  So they're...  We're on in Chicago right now.  She's watching.  Hey, what's up, Chicago?  That's all right.  Make sure it was a nice story. 
[01:57:00]  No, God.  Hey, Chicago rules.  So anyway, she goes like this.  She goes, whatever.  The Mets hit her, whatever.  They score some runs, whatever.  She opens up the sliding glass door.  She goes running out into the patio area.  Look what the hell is she doing?  She runs to the fence of neighbors.  She goes, take that, you goddamn cubbies fan, and go back to Chicago where you're from.  The Cubs suck.  Where'd I go, Milky?  Am I exaggerating? 
[01:57:30]  No.  Strike three!  If there was a bad call...  This dumb guy is from Chicago.  They pay him off straight.  That's what mobsters are from, Chicago.  And they're paying off the damn cubbies.  They do.  They do.  They do.  They do.  They're the Braves.  Yeah.  We all know that.  Die hard Mets fan, huh?  Yeah.  Sorry to hear that.  Too bad.  We're having a tough year.  It's a tough year for the Mets.  We're done.  We're done.  We're just done. 
[01:58:00]  Jim, matter of fact, your office called me asking if I want some Mets tickets from you.  I haven't called you back.  I can't give away.  I can't go in Yahoo.  I'm just so depressed.  I'm going Yahoo.  Anyone want fireworks night?  No.  Hey, McGuire's coming.  Nice.  I'll watch it on TV.  Can't even make fun of Rocker anymore at Shea Stadium.  You can't do anything.  What are you going to do?  Yankees are gone.  There's nothing to do but fight Mexicans.  So why are you guys in town today?  There you go. 
[01:58:30]  Inappropriate, pal.  Mom, why are you in town?  I'm visiting him.  Just hanging?  I decided to come in and try to keep him in line.  Yeah.  Good luck.  We're just hanging.  I'll tell you.  That's cool.  We're hanging.  We have other moms.  Jam fest tonight.  Oh, yeah?  What's that about?  It's just jam.  It's just, you know, it's like a festival.  It's awards.  People are jam.  You're hosting it, right?  Yeah.  Can the public go?  Yeah, it's beyond.  Oh, sold out and all that?  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  So we don't have to talk about that.  No, we don't talk about that.  Well, we could talk about Caroline's if you have nothing to do.

Which baby's at birth?  Yeah.  Now, I could see.  I could see where Pooper got a little.  Some of this from.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Mom's hysterical now.  Yeah.  Just hysterical.  She tends to grab her boob when she's annoyed at me.  And she goes.  What'd you say?  Pfft, pfft. 
[02:03:30]  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  What'd you say?  You're kidding?  I'm kidding you.  Hey, we got to take a break.  We're so old.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.

[02:04:00]  No!  Let the party hit the boat.  Let the party hit the boat.  Let the party hit the boat.  Let the party hit the boat.  Let the party hit the boat.  Let the party hit the boat.  I'm who's out.  I'm who's out.  No!  And this is the Opie and Anthony show.  Give us a call.  Toll free.  877-692-1027. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Very happy to be here.  Yes.  I can't believe that stripper called up and said she doesn't want to be called a stripper.  She wants to be called a dancer.  People pounding her about that.  Here's the difference.  A stripper is a chick that takes off her clothes and a dancer is an HIV positive Russian.  Tony from Philly writes on the Instant Feedback.  I'm so sick of strippers saying that they are dancers.  The last time I checked, when you go to a ballet, you can't see the dancer's effing uterus. 
[02:05:00]  You can't see the dancer's effing uterus.  So tell Miss Blake to shut the eff up and I'll give her a goddamn dollar.  See you next Tuesday from New York.  There's nothing exotic about a worn out clam.  Oh yeah, because she wants to be called an exotic performer too, right?  An exotic performer or just a dancer?  Vinny from Rosedale.  The difference between strippers and dancers is that strippers know when to shut their mouths.  She's just getting pounded by that. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  I'm not a hooker.  I'm a s*** extractor.  Let's go to Grant.  Grant, what's going on?  Hey, how we doing, Chief?  We're doing all right.  Yeah, I've got a little problem with these ladies who like themselves referred to as dancers.  What I'm curious, do we still have to refer to the ones who stand there like it's a bus stop?  Yeah, you ever see the ones that just stand there?  And collect money.  And collect money.  And sometimes they stand up and raise a foot and kind of stomp around a little bit. 
[02:06:00]  And then they just stand there and walk over and grab the money.  Or then the ones that kneel down and talk to one of the customers.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know.  That cannot possibly.  I'm going to college.  I'm doing it.  Get you.  Shake your ass.  Panda, to see you shake that ass.  Not talk to my neighbor over here.  Yeah, that cannot possibly be worse than the women who stand up there, three of them in a clump.  It makes a good point with the strippers that want to have that conversation with you. 
[02:06:30]  God, it's, you know.  What about the ones that are having a conversation?  I go home for a conversation.  You don't want conversation.  And you know something?  I remember some of the old days of the strip clubs.  The local suburban strip clubs.  Not like the city ones where they just want to sit on your lap and grab all the money.  Remember the rug act they used to do?  Where they would take the quilt, like from home, spread it out on the stage, put on a slow song,  and sit there and just like diddle, roll around, show their ass, get doggy style.  And then you'd watch this and the music would stop. 
[02:07:00]  And she'd take part of the quilt and cover her boobies up.  She was just, she was just like probing herself.  And then the song stops or she doesn't like it.  Jamie, could you press reject?  Could you reject this one?  And she's covering her cans with the quilt.  And then the music starts again.  You know, she gets a song she likes.  We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  And she's back at it, legs flying in the air.  That's so true.  Lots of oil, too.  Yeah, all the oil they did. 
[02:07:30]  The oil or the creams, whatever the hell it is.  I used to love the rug act.  Lisa.  Lisa.  Hello.  Yes.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yes, there is a difference.  A difference between strippers and dancers?  Are you a stripper?  Yes, I am.  Okay.  I believe that strippers are the ones that actually get up there and strip and take their  clothes off and get naked.  And there's go-go dancers, the ones that dance in Jersey, that go as far as a bikini and dance.  They don't, you know, they don't do the lap dances.  They just dance on a stage and dance in a bikini. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, but those girls don't even get naked.  So we're talking, that's the law.  That's not their choice.  That's the law in Jersey.  Yeah, the difference between dancer and a stripper is, um, with a stripper.  Well, you got go-go dancers and then you got strippers.  Well, a stripper's found in a dumpster.  No one cares.  And I don't have to apologize.  Wasn't Norton.  Brett, what's up?  Hey, Brett.  I had a correct Anthony.  These boys, they don't give you a knee job.  They give you a shin job.  Is it a shin job?  No, because it was the knee. 
[02:08:30]  Because you're sitting down.  And the only way she could get her knee in there is to bend at the knee and slide it  on the surface of the seat right up to your thingy.  They do the knee-calf move.  They go all the way down the shin and then up and down the shin, these whores.  I mean, uh, whatever they are.  These whores.  All right, Brett.  What club do you go to?  Thank you.  I want to go.  Yeah.  I used to, you know, you could go into a strip club.  Remember we just went to Flash Dancers like a couple of weeks back? 
[02:09:00]  And, uh, we sit down.  You're spending 20 bucks a clip just to have one girl come over.  Whether you want it or not, you can't just sit there.  I like the bars, like the old tender trap on Long Island, that crap hole that you would  walk in.  Hey, they get mad when we say that because they have, uh...  Oh, we've renovated.  They've renovated.  You changed the shag carpeting that smelled like vomit and feet?  Have you changed the dancers that smelled like vomit and feet?  They remodeled. 
[02:09:30]  We had one of the dancers in there.  I'm saying I love the place, Gelman.  Do you remember how hot Peaches was?  Peaches.  Peaches rocked.  She was in our best-ass contest.  Well, you used to be able to go into those places like that, like the tender trap or  the carousel out there or whatever.  You sit your ass down.  You get your five, six dollar beer.  And then you'd have a couple of singles left over from your ten.  And if you felt that you wanted a girl to come over, you'd pulled up the buck.  She'd come over.  It cost you one dollar.  And then she'd make her rounds. 
[02:10:00]  And you're enjoying the guy sitting next to you getting his little dance.  You know?  It didn't cost a lot of money.  Now, 20 bucks, she's going to come up.  I don't want a knee job.  I don't want to spend 20 bucks on that.  And it's also stressful because the dancers are coming up to you every 30 seconds.  It's like, I just want to sit here, mellow out, check out some T&A.  There's 20 dancers walking around.  They each will get one leaves.  Another one comes up.  What the hell?  You know?  What am I?  An ATM? 
[02:10:30]  Get out of here, you hooah.  What about this basketball thing?  What's that?  They pull their panties out a little bit.  And you've got to sit there and throw dollar bills in your pants.  I haven't seen that move yet.  Oh, yeah.  That's a big thing now.  Throw it in.  I get ripped off a couple of weeks ago.  Well, Bill, you're doing it.  No, no.  You do the basketball thing.  But this girl comes over.  She says hi.  I'm like, hey, what's going on?  She starts rubbing my shoulders.  I'm like, this is nice.  Give him a full massage.  And then what?  It's like 20 bucks. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, gee.  Get out of here.  An erotic massage, you got.  An erotic massage.  You didn't even want it.  No, I didn't want it.  I'm sitting there minding my own business.  These frigging hooahs are getting out of hand with this stuff.  Because you at least knew your place.  You sat on your goddamn bar stool.  You drank your expensive beer.  The dancer's kind of behind the bar.  She stepped on the bar.  You knew she was coming over.  You gave her the goddamn dollar.  Now these broads are walking around.  They rub your shoulders.  And then it's like 20 bucks.  Right.  You don't pay.  And, hey, Rocco, find the judge. 
[02:11:30]  Help the judge find his checkbook.  That's exactly what happened.  You know?  You walk by, they brush a boob on you.  Five bucks.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And if you're stupid enough to pull out all your money, all the dancers attack you like  they're...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, forget about it.  Like the pigeons are attacking the old lady at the park that has the bread.  You leave the french fries unattended at the beach.  Yeah.  And watch the seagulls.  Ah!  Ah!  It's like the stock market scene from Trading Places.  Yeah.  John, what's going on?  Not much.  There were a couple of bars on Long Island. 
[02:12:00]  A gaslight.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Sound familiar?  Uh-huh.  And the bogots.  You two were right next to each other?  Yep.  Uh, blood-sucking leeches, they were.  Suck the money right out of your hand.  I hate that, man.  You know, you used to know what you were getting.  There were a couple that were hot that you didn't mind, but, you know, the rest of them  were like...  And then when these dirtbag places try to, now they see what's going on in the city, and  they try to incorporate it into their other clubs.  Like, there was a local club out on Long Island, that all of a sudden, now they had to have 
[02:12:30]  a room, like the champagne room or the lap dance room.  Yeah.  It was nothing more than, I swear to God, it was like a stall that they built.  Some guy came in with some paneling and made a stall that was no wider than about three  feet wide.  They put a chair in there, and now the girls are walking up.  You want a lap dance?  Yeah, she'd drag you to this veal stall, where you would sit, she would wiggle around in  front of you, 20 bucks.  And then she'd give you the shift.  Honey. 
[02:13:00]  I'm not in Manhattan, honey.  Eh.  You're getting Long Island stripper rates, and it's daytime rates.  Daytime.  Daytime stripper.  Daytime stripper.  What hurts your eyes more, looking at her walking out when you're done?  You shield your eyes.  I bought a shot of water for one, for 12 bucks.  A shot of water?  What?  She's like, you want to buy me a shot?  I'm like, no, no, no, really.  She's rubbing on me and hanging on me.  I'm like, all right.  All right.  Okay.  Sad.  I buy, yeah, they're pouring water into their shot glasses.  Of course. 
[02:13:30]  12 bucks.  How do you know that, though?  I checked it out.  Wow.  See, that way they get the money, but they don't have to spend it on the booze.  Yeah, a little bit left out, you know.  It was well fucked.  Yeah, it did.  No kidding.  Who are the jackassers?  What are you, an idiot?  Yeah.  Who are the jackassers?  Because when I used to sit at these bars, and I would just have my few bucks, and I'm  there for maximum time potential.  You've got to know how to milk your beer.  You've got to know how to dole out the bucks.  You've got to know the girl that's over with the guy next to you. 
[02:14:00]  That's good.  I don't have to pay her.  Problem was, I wasn't milking my beer.  See, you've got to milk that beer.  Next thing you know, you've got these massive mammaries laying on your lap, and you're  showing up money.  Because then they come around the other side, when one of the other girls get up on stage,  and now they're your pals.  Now they go, hi, honey.  Hi.  You don't even like, I'm going to fall for this gag?  If I buy her a drink, maybe I'll go home with her and be able to duct tape her mouth shut  and chop her up.  A lot more.  A lot, Jim.  Look at Jim. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  But you know what?  In fairness to these girls, man, and I know what you're saying, these are nines and tens  dealing with guys that are ones and twos.  I hear you.  You've got to act interested in these disgusting men.  Absolutely, but I just want to go in, and I don't want to be pressured.  If I just want to sit there, and I'll dole out some cash for them.  I'm not stingy, but I don't want them coming up, pumping my pockets.  I'm going to go and unload a batch on one of them and go, 20 bucks.  You know? 
[02:15:00]  How do you like it?  Now go clean off.  Back in the Army, back in Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  Yeah.  You've got a bunch of Vietnam refugees.  All these little Chinese.  Oh, God.  Japs.  Yeah, and they were ridiculous.  They'd come walking over with a bottle of champagne, put it down, and all these GIs.  They haven't seen a girl in months.  Yeah.  And they said, you know, would you like to buy me a champagne?  And they do.  And that would be it.  And it would be like, you didn't ask for it, nothing.  And if you didn't pay for it, she would call over the big guy in the corner, you know? 
[02:15:30]  Squeeze it out of you.  Squeeze bars, they used to call.  Squeeze bars.  Scotty Dementia, what's up?  Hey, I've got a funny story about the bars.  Yeah.  You know who suffers?  The midget suffers.  Let me tell you why.  We go there, right?  We have a good time.  I go by the girl a drink.  And the bouncer says she'd like to buy her a drink.  It's all right.  It costs me $10, $20.  Now, if she wants to buy her another one, another 20 bucks, I'm down almost 100 bucks already.  I can't even get a kiss from the chick.  I'm buying her drinks all night.  Why?  She didn't want to kiss a midget? 
[02:16:00]  Or dwarf?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  You want to buy her a drink.  That's what they tell me.  So I buy her a drink, you know.  Then you want to buy her a Dom Perignon.  You are the Dom Perignon.  Wait, are you that zap?  Scotty, you think you're going to get something from the strippers?  Yeah, why are you buying strippers drinks?  Where's that rich voice?  I didn't buy them.  They wanted me to buy them.  I know, but you don't fall for that.  Scotty, look at the bright side.  When you're nose to nose, your toes is in it.  When you're toes to toes, your nose is in it.  Yeah, you've got the nice view.  Let me put some Jerry Mahoney clothes.  I've got a big date tonight. 
[02:16:30]  All right, Scotty.  All right, let's take a break.  There you go.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  WNEW.  Anthony, it's time for a segment that we like to call.  Is this guy in the New York area right now? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I think so.  He's not listening to us right now.  Don't worry.  Oh, okay.  We're safe.  Explain it fast, though, before someone can tell him what's going on.  Wow, this guy is driving around the country or something.  He's living in his car for 52 days for what?  I don't know.  It's some kind of Valvoline motor oil thing.  And they pitch these guests to us every so often that we can absolutely positively have  nothing of interest to do with this person. 
[02:17:30]  We call it bad guest.  Yeah, this is another bad guest on the Opie and Anthony show.  We call it bad guest segment.  We take the guest, and then we do certain things.  Sometimes you just F with them until they hang up.  I don't even know what to F with this guy with.  I mean, this is something I don't know what to even do with.  He's been living in his car nonstop for how many days?  29 days so far, I guess.  Hasn't left the car?  No, he leaves the car.  I don't know what he's doing.  It's like some kind of motor oil promotion. 
[02:18:00]  Valvoline motor oil?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's talk to him and see how it's going.  Silent game.  Shh.  What's his name?  Sam?  Sam.  All right, Rick is talking to him.  Be energetic, Opie.  As soon as Sam is put on hold, we can pick him up.  Sam.  Yes.  Hey, Sam, how are you doing?  Pretty good.  How are you doing?  Good.  Very good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Here in New York.  So what's going on, Sam?  Not much.  I'm just sitting here on Lexington here my last 48 hours in the car.  Now, you've been driving for how long, Sam?  Well, just in, driving, sleeping, eating, in the car.  Living in your car?  Yeah.  50 days.  50 days.  You've been living in your car for 50 days?  Yeah.  This is day 51.  I bet you a lot of people have asked you this.  That's true.  How do you relieve yourself, Sam?  Good question. 
[02:19:00]  I get 10 minutes every two hours to go to the bathroom and get showers.  Are you setting some kind of record, Sam?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I hate this crap.  Sam.  Yeah.  You actually, you're trying to live in your car nonstop for a certain amount of days, right?  Right.  But you get 10 minutes to take a leak and shower and stuff?  Well, I mean, just so that I don't come down with, like, venereal diseases and, like, malaria  and things like that.  Sam, you can't get VD from your car.  Who knows what you can get inside this car? 
[02:19:30]  That sucks.  I thought you were, you know, you had to take leaks in the car and, you know, try to, you  know, keep as clean as possible.  No, you know, the Avelines made it a little more humane for me.  Well, what's the big deal if you can leave the car to shower and take a leak?  You should be locked in there with a bottle.  Anyone could do that.  It's still not that easy.  I suggest you, at the end of work on Friday, go home, hop in your car, and just stay there  until you go to work on Monday, and just see how it feels, and then come back to me. 
[02:20:00]  Some people have lived in their cars and not had a place to shower.  Your phone is crackling really bad, Sam.  I'm sorry.  You know, we're here in between all the tall buildings.  I see.  So, have you seen anything interesting while living in your car?  I've seen a lot of stuff, but, you know, you've got kind of this standard view from the  car.  You do a lot of people watching.  There's a lot of people around doing funny things.  Sam, any flat tires? 
[02:20:30]  I actually caught a flat tire on the way down in Tampa, so we actually got to the place  and got it patched up before, you know, it got too bad.  Thank God.  It almost wrecked your whole promotion.  Well, I mean, I could have sat in the car while we, you know, got the car over to the,  you know, station and got it fixed.  What are you eating, Sam?  A lot of, watch this, drive-thru food?  A lot of fast food, but I've definitely had some people, you know, to help me get some  food, and there's always been somebody watching me, and that same person can go and give me 
[02:21:00]  some food that's a little bit better.  You can't hear us right now.  You can't hear right now.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Sam, what else can you tell us about this adventure you've been on?  Well, you know, it's been a hell of an adventure.  I mean, it's 75,000 minutes in my car.  You know, Max Life Motorhills for cars with 70,000 miles or more, and whenever it gets tough  and I don't think I'm going to make it, I just picture that $75,000 that I'm going to get.  So, what can I say? 
[02:21:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  You guys there?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  Getting full reception here, but I can't hear you guys at all. 
[02:22:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, that was painful.  Oh, that was painful.  I love that game.  Silent game.  So painful to sit through.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, it's thing.  You sent off the silent sensor from the transmitter?  Like, if nothing's going on in the air?  Oh, there's an alarm?  The alarm's going on outside.  Peace out of the heart. 
[02:22:30]  The dead air alarm.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  I love that gag.  Let me recover from that.  Oh, nice.  Silent game rules.  Silent game rules.  So cruel.  Very, very good.  Sam's calling back.  Thank God.  What happened?  Sam.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  What happened to your phone? 
[02:23:00]  I have no idea.  Could you guys hear me?  Now we can.  Now we can.  Sure.  It was just totally dead, but I was getting full reception.  I'm not certain.  So why don't we just continue with the interview?  All right.  We had to play a song in between, but what did we ask you?  There was something about, you know, the last thing we heard was a $75,000 prize?  Yeah.  That's the whole motivation of this thing.  Hello?  Yeah, could you tell us more about that?  Like, how did you qualify, or how did you get started in this? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, well, I won an essay contest.  I was looking for the ultimate car lover, and they put out an essay contest on the internet,  Why You Love Your Car, and I won that.  The winner got to do the challenge.  Hello?  Hello?  God, it's painful.  What do they call that pain that you get? 
[02:24:00]  What is that pain?  Like, I'm feeling actual pain.  Hoof-ah.  Doug, what's going on?  Oh, yeah, man.  Thank God for the silent game with that stupid ass man.  Hoof-ah.  Later, guys.  All right, Doug.  I'm cringing.  What?  Sam's calling back. 
[02:24:30]  Hold on.  Hello, Sam.  Yeah.  What the hell's going on?  I have no idea.  I'm getting full reception on that other phone.  I got a different phone now.  Well, Sam, we're the top-rated radio show here in New York, and we squeeze into our busy  show, and, you know, you got to get a phone that works a little better.  I'm sorry.  It seemed to be working a little bit ago.  It worked last night.  How are you?  All right.  Well, God, now we're just kind of annoyed.  I'm sorry?  What can I do? 
[02:25:00]  To be quite frank with you.  All right.  So, where were we, Ant?  So, when does this whole living in the car thing end?  It ends Thursday at 1210.  And what's the first thing you're going to do after you get out of the car?  Uh, I think I'm going to go for a run.  I want to get out of the car and move.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[02:25:30]  Stop it!  Stop it!  Don't call back!  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  The pain you're feeling when you do that is called the douche chills.  Yeah, I know.  You get that feeling in your chest like you want to do something.  I can't.  Like you want to do something.  But you can't because it's a styling game.  It's like when you're watching a movie and some really embarrassing part comes out. 
[02:26:00]  And you're embarrassed to be with your chick or something.  Yeah, you got to sit there and you just, oh, oh.  That's funny.  Thank you, Mike.  No problem.  All right.  Let's go to Ryan.  Ryan, what's going on?  Yo, I'd rather get a root canal than listen to this guy.  It's killing me.  He called back three times.  All right, Ryan.  Thank you.  Yeah, later, man.  Bye.  Bye.  I hate that game.  Huh?  I hate that game.  I love that game. 
[02:26:30]  Is he calling back?  No, please don't.  Please don't call back.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  No?  All right.  I think we should take a break.  I'm just looking at that line.  I do not want that to light up.  Why?  This is funny.  It kills me.  It kills me.  I'm all sweating.  I'm sweating.  Hey, Rick, why don't you call him back?  Oh, no.  See what's happening.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Ask him yourself.  Damn it.  If we can't get this problem taken care of. 
[02:27:00]  Well, I called Pete, and Pete's working on the phone.  Because now we're finding out it might be on our end.  Sam.  Yeah, how you doing?  What the hell's going on?  This is my third phone.  I mean, I think, I mean, really, I'm not certain.  Yeah, Sam.  I apologize, because we're trying to see if it's on our end now.  All righty.  Where are you getting all these cell phones from?  Well, just the people I'm with are here, and they're just lending me theirs, like, one  at a time.  Oh, God.  Sam, you're not calling a little radio station in the middle of nowhere.  I'm sorry. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, I...  You think Valvoline would have figured this out and given you, you know, some fine phones.  It is New York.  We got the tall buildings.  You know, we don't get the greatest reception.  Oh, well, I was getting full reception even on the first phone, but it just wasn't, for  some reason, I just went totally dead.  Wow.  I got to tell you, I'm really frustrated.  I mean, I was really enjoying the interview.  This is something that our listeners could really get into.  Now, I don't even know if I want to talk to you.  I'm sorry.  Oh, B, it's not his fault.  Can we talk to your boss? 
[02:28:00]  Don't be, um...  Yeah, you can talk to my boss.  Who's that?  My keeper.  Your keeper?  You want to talk to one of my keepers?  You got somebody that's taking care of you?  Well, there you know, they're watching me to make sure I stay in contact with the car.  Are they freaking out with the phones crapping out?  Well, yeah, they don't really know what was going on either.  Oh, damn.  All right.  Well, uh, Anthony, you have a question for Sam?  Well, I'm a little distracted, I know.  It's, um...  We do want to know what kind of...  Because, uh, a lot of times, size of a car matters. 
[02:28:30]  You're sleeping in the car, right?  Yep.  What kind of car are you using?  It's a 91 Acura Integra.  Hatchback.  Hatchback.  All right.  It's like a car.  What car are you driving at this point?  It's comfortable?  Uh, not really.  I mean, it's small, but it's like a little dog bed, and, uh...  Basically, the really gross part, though, is when you wake up in the morning and the windows  are all fogged up...  Yeah.  ...being curled up on the back of your tongue.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Ah.  You want to take some calls, maybe, from our listeners? 
[02:29:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  Because I really don't want to talk to you anymore.  Opie.  Now, come on.  It's not beautiful.  You're not.  What?  I feel so bad.  Well, you should, Sam.  The guy feels bad.  We're a very busy show here.  We had to, like, put off a lot of the things we were going to do on our show today for you.  Opie, be nice.  Come on, now.  The guy's putting in the effort, and it's his phone.  All right.  Well, why don't we put you on with some of our listeners for some serious questions only for Sam,  who's been living in his car for, what, a couple days?  Uh, 50.  50. 
[02:29:30]  50 days.  50 days.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Let me put you on with Clark.  Please, serious questions only for Sam.  Clark, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Listen, I got a nice question for you, Sam, is it?  Uh, have you been using the Valvoline as a lubricant to spank it?  Okay.  Enough.  Sam, you...  I haven't tried that yet.  Well, maybe you should.  We asked him serious questions.  Sam, I'm sorry.  Again, our audience sometimes gets a little, uh, a little wacky.  They try to be wacky.  We want, uh, and that's why we want serious, uh... 
[02:30:00]  Serious questions only.  Let's go to Charles.  Charles, you got a question for Sam, who's been living in his car for, I don't know, a few days or so?  Yeah, Sam, what's up, man?  How you doing?  What's happening?  I think it's a great thing that you're doing.  I wanted to know, does the new Acura Valvoline come with the synthetic blow-up, though?  All right.  Very funny.  It doesn't.  It doesn't.  Sam?  Stupid listener.  Sam?  Yeah.  You know, we're trying to conduct an interview here, and we think, uh, taking calls might be a good thing with, uh, serious questions only. 
[02:30:30]  Please.  Chris, what's going on?  You got a serious question for Sam?  Yeah, I'd like to know his location.  I'm sure there's about 10,000 people.  I'd love to know where he's located, right?  Yeah, Sam, where are you located?  I'm on Lexington.  Why do you want to know where he's, uh, located, Chris?  Maybe we could come down and, like, throw bottles and rocks at the car.  We could keep him in there for the next few hours.  All right.  You know, oh, this isn't going well.  Sam, would you like people to throw stuff at you?  Uh, it's not really my first choice for the activities around the car, but, you know. 
[02:31:00]  Of course not.  All right, hold on.  Well, we could keep him in there for a while.  All right, hold on.  Let me get rid of, uh, that obnoxious listener of our show.  I'm going to take that.  You know, we want, uh...  Serious questions.  Let's try one more here.  Frank.  Uh, hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  You got a serious question for Sam?  This is a pretty big, uh...  Yeah, no, because this thing, this thing kind of, uh, it sounds cool to me.  Uh, how long have you been in the car now, Sam?  Uh, this is day 51.  And you come out, like, what, in two days?  On Thursday. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  Well, when are you coming out of the closet?  Because you sound like a, like a flamer.  Oh.  Yeah, that's going to be a couple days after.  Really?  Oh, so, uh, we got an exclusive.  You will be coming out of the closet, Sam?  Well, I mean, I just go in there to get my shoes, and then I come back out.  All right.  Frank, you want to make out or something?  All right, all right.  The truck.  All right.  Now, thank you for that call.  What a...  Oh, I can't take this.  I'm embarrassed, uh, to our listeners.  Uh, let's go to Michael.  Michael.  Hey, guys. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, we've had enough fun.  Now, do you have a serious question for Sam?  Yeah.  Okay.  Sam.  Yeah.  Do you have a life?  Don't.  Do you have a job?  I'm trying to be an actor in L.A.  Are you living in a friggin' car for 50 days?  I'm trying to be an actor in L.A., so I'm pretty jocky.  You're trying to be an actor in L.A.?  Do you have a girlfriend or a wife?  Uh, yeah, I have a girlfriend.  Yeah, what does she think of your, uh, your, your, your thing?  You're living in a car for 50 days, my friend.  Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm making, uh, $75,000.  What can I do?  That's all you're going to make the rest of your life is $75,000? 
[02:32:30]  You're a loser, pal.  Oh, my.  Get away.  Oh, Michael.  Michael.  Thank God.  Sam, again, I, I gotta apologize.  I, I don't think these people really get the gist of what you're doing.  Listen, you know, this is a highlight of Sam's life.  He doesn't need, uh.  I know, people knocking him down like that, and, uh, I, I don't know, I don't know what  to do now.  I, I, I'm just, I'm modified, I'm, I'm embarrassed, uh, for our listeners.  Well, you know, I have faith in our listeners.  Let's, uh, let's go to Tim.  Tim, you got a serious question for Sam, please. 
[02:33:00]  Yes, yes, Sam.  Yeah?  Uh, I was wondering, how many hookers can you foot in an Acura, and is Valvoline paying  me for that?  Um, I can't really fit any, I don't think, maybe one, and, and they're definitely not  going to foot the bill on that.  How many notches you got in your belt already?  Yeah.  Um, yeah, I've, I've been wearing a belt.  All right, well.  There's gotta be some fun to this, Sam.  Oh, my God, I can't believe this.  Well.  I can't, I, I can't, I can't, I can't, uh, sit here and be party to this, Opie. 
[02:33:30]  Sam?  Yeah.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm cool.  Okay.  Well, any, uh, any final thoughts before we, uh, we let you go?  I mean, like, what are you doing for the rest of the day?  Anything?  Uh, not much.  I think we're just gonna, uh, hang out, you know?  We're in New York City.  I'm in my car.  Just kind of sit there?  Yeah.  Drive around a little bit, get a little bit of the traffic, you know?  It's nice.  All right, uh, Rick just tell me that Joe has a good question online, too.  Finally.  Joe, you got a question for Sam? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, a very serious question.  So I was wondering if he ever woke up one morning with the gear shift up his balloon  nut.  Sam?  The what?  Have you ever, have you mounted the, the, the gear shift?  For a little simulation?  Uh, I haven't.  The gas tank, though.  The gas tank.  Uh-huh.  That, that's, that's funny.  What, eh?  What's wrong?  Sam?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Uh, Juice, Juice has something.  Juice, what's going on?  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  How you doing?  Good.  It sounds like you're a car enthusiast, Juice.  I, I am.  Sam, I really like cars.  Okay. 
[02:34:30]  Um, Sam, I was wondering for about the past half hour, um, could you drink some Valvoline  and die, please?  The, the which?  Drink some Valvoline and die.  That would be great.  It would really be great for this radio show.  Thanks.  All right, uh, that's, that's a little over the line, right, uh, right, Ant?  Nothing, yeah, and there's nothing I could say now.  There's nothing I could say.  No?  You know, our listeners are going to have to be reprimanded and punished for, um, for treating  a guest like this.  I, I'm beside myself, Sam.  We have a guy named, uh, Biff on line 12, Anthony, who has a serious question for Sam. 
[02:35:00]  Uh, Biff.  Yo, fellas.  Hey, what's up, Biff?  Calling from L.A., man.  Wow, a black, L.A.  A black Biff.  Yeah.  Who knew?  Yeah, hey, hey, hey, Sam.  Yeah.  Sam, I'm banging your girlfriend while you're driving in your car, you loser.  That's, that's bad for me, I guess.  Oh, my.  Sam, do you worry about that?  Someone, you know, dogging your, your girl while you're doing this, uh, crazy stunt?  Uh, I'm not really too concerned about that. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, you should be, because I'm sharing it with all my friends.  Ooh, sounds like a bad scene over there.  It is.  All right.  You ain't gonna recognize it when you get it back.  All right, Biff.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Sam.  Yeah.  Any just final, uh, thoughts or, uh, information you could give us on this, uh, thing you did?  I'm really speechless at this point.  That was really a bunch of absolutely original questions.  And so are we, because we're playing the silent game one more time here.  Final edition.  Here comes a hello. 
[02:36:00]  Hello?  There it is.  Listen to this guy.  Listen to this guy.  Give us another one.  Hello?  Come on.  Hello?  Yeah, there's another one.  What a fool.  He can't hear us.  Come on.  Come on.  Ah!  There he goes again.  Did you like the good cop, bad cop, Opie?  Yes, I enjoyed that.  Like I give a flying F.  All right.  All right.  That went well.  I thought that went very well.  Cool. 
[02:36:30]  Andy, what's up?  Hello?  Andy, what's going on?  Hello?  Andy, you idiot.  Hello?  You're not playing that game.  Hello?  The buttons are up.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve?  You've got to turn the buttons on or we play the silent game with everybody.  Steve, I got you.  Steve, what's up?  No silent game with me, please.  All right.  What's up, Steve?  You know what's worse than the pain you get from the silent game is the pain you get from  that guy having to say he's sorry to you, Opie.  Yeah, Opie gets him to apologize. 
[02:37:00]  What a tool.  I apologize for nothing.  All right.  Great game.  Peace.  Cool.  We love the silent game.  And a lot of the newer markets don't know that.  When we do ask for serious questions only, it is an all-points bulletin, an alert to the  listeners to just ask the most ridiculous, stupid, stupid, embarrassing, ridiculous questions.  Yes.  Right on.  All right.  More to come.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027. 
[02:37:30]  Opie.  Anthony.  Opie.  Anthony.  Opie.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  WNEW.  Yeah, Opie, boy, the weathermen just having a ball with this heat wave.  Yeah, well, we're in the middle of a heat wave.  Heat wave.  That's what they're saying.  We've been waiting all winter for this.  Let's enjoy it before we start making it into a negative.  We didn't have a spring.  We went right from winter to summer, it seems.  That's what they're trying to say. 
[02:38:00]  Yesterday, the first really, no, we kind of had a warm day.  But, I mean, it was blazing hot yesterday and Saturday.  So, eh, Saturday night, I'm watching the news.  And they're like, this summer-style heat, how long is it going to last?  The heat wave, hopefully forever.  But it was like a day that it was hot.  And they're already, oh, people trying to find a way to get out of this heat.  It just got hot.  And then they show the same, same shots year after year. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, there's the chick unrolling her little towel in Central Park.  Here's the reporter walking on the beach watching the girls frolic in the waves.  Well, he takes off his jacket, though, at the beach.  Yeah.  So he looks comfortable, but he still has the tie on and everything.  Well, he's loosened up.  He's at the beach.  So he takes his sports coat and slings it over his shoulder.  But he's still got the shirt buttoned up to the neck and the tie and everything.  Yeah, that's how we all go to the beach, with a dress shirt on and a tie.  Or people head to the beach to get out of the heat. 
[02:39:00]  And then they give you the rules, the things that you have to do in this weather.  Avoid alcohol.  Check on the elderly.  And make sure you're dressing like clothing.  Yeah.  Unless you're a homeless guy and you're going to wear that snorkel jacket year-round.  The smelly homeless guy.  But it's the same thing.  And then they show, oh, the people in the public Petri dish.  Oh, the pools.  The pools.  That's right.  The public pools. 
[02:39:30]  Man.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  They're stacked in there.  All you see are heads.  Mm-hmm.  It just, it looks like a big Afro carpet.  The whole way across.  And the funny thing is, the pools don't even have water in them yet.  They're just waiting.  No, that's it.  All they got to do is they get everyone in there.  They pour in one bucket of water and everyone's up to their shoulders in water.  It's amazing.  We ought to, you know what we got to do?  We have to get a little mason jar full of the water from one of those city pools and 
[02:40:00]  keep it here just in case anyone F's up.  You got a shot of city pool water.  Let's have it analyzed.  Yeah.  Oh, we can do that.  Can you imagine the stuff you would find in the water?  Oh, imagine what goes through that skimmer.  Oh, my God.  I don't know who the hell would go in those things.  Nick, what's going on?  Hi.  This is Nick in Queens.  I'd like to report that the heat is still hot here.  Yeah, I know.  The heat is hot, you're saying. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, Pete, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I hate the friggin' weather, man.  I swear to God, nobody's ever happy in this city.  That's what sucks about New York, man.  It's too cold, it's too hot, it's too windy.  Bunch of wussies.  I was very happy with the heat this weekend.  Love it.  I know, me too.  We've been waiting all year for this.  Shut up.  Love it.  I know.  Everybody complains about the weather.  I love it.  The weather geeks, it's just a waste of seven minutes every night when they're on the news.  And longer than that now. 
[02:41:00]  You could say, you could sum up the weather in 15 seconds tops.  You could tell them what the weather was for today and what it'll be for tomorrow in 15 seconds.  They waste, what, up to 10 minutes of a newscast now?  No, they show you what the temperature is at that moment.  They show you a quick clip of maybe Central Park or something, or someone kayaking, or something like that.  And then they go, we're going to tell you what the weather's going to be tomorrow, a little later in the broadcast.  Get the weather over with then and there, and everything will be fine.  Right.  They've got to milk it, and they've got to bitch, and they've got to tell you the same stuff and show you the same clips. 
[02:41:30]  One thing I love, though, the daily news, you've got to love what they do when the weather gets nice.  They always get the chicks at the beach picture.  Look at that picture they put on page four.  I know.  Then they make believe it's like an innocent photo and stuff.  What is the caption under that really hot shot?  It says, cool conditions.  Nansiel Santos gets splashed by pals Gina Salino and Lucy Pompeo.  They must have been at Jones Beach. 
[02:42:00]  At Hampton Bays.  Go figure.  Oh, okay.  But it's probably the three hottest chicks they found at the beach.  And they're splashing and looking like, you know, they're going to go back to their blanket and just rip their shorts off and start munching.  Like, that's totally what comes to mind when you see that picture.  No, it's just a cute, innocent weather shot.  Yeah, a big headline, 61-year heat record melts.  Why aren't they taking the same shot of, like, I'm sure at that same beach they had the old ladies with the old lady bathing suits on, 
[02:42:30]  frolicking in the water.  Why not take a picture of them?  You know, the old lady bathing suits just don't cover up enough.  Should they just be wearing those big old-fashioned diving bell suits at the beach?  Because if I see one square inch of that dimpled cottage cheese stretched with latex stretched over it, leg,  where you could see her pulse from 20 paces in any of the many veins. 
[02:43:00]  Boom, boom, boom.  I don't want to see that at the beach.  I want to see Nan Seal frolicking with her other friends.  But if they're in the old lady bathing suit and they're making sauce, that's a different story.  Oh, yeah, well, we were desperate.  We had a look.  Our first week in New York City when we got this job.  You know, we've told the story a million times, but it's a great, great memory.  They put us up in a hotel, the kind people here at NAW.  That was the last nice thing they did for us. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, so we're having to hang out in the hotel.  You watch TV, you get bored, so we get binoculars.  And we're looking out the window at the apartment across the way.  And we're, you know, hoping to see some hot chick exercising naked.  No.  We see a 70-year-old woman.  70? You're being kind.  Yeah, I know.  She had to be older, Ed.  At least 70 years old, making sauce in her kitchen.  All fine and well.  But she's wearing an old lady bathing suit. 
[02:44:00]  And the strap across her shoulder kept falling off.  Kept falling off, so she's got, like, that strap-off-the-shoulder look with that big old lady boob, like, hanging.  Well, you know, the color of everything in old lady just becomes, like, white and liver spot.  So that even nip disappears, you know?  Oh, my God.  And gravity has just made her body look like E.T.  What, are you bathing the elderly at the nursing homes? 
[02:44:30]  How do you know this?  No, please.  Enough people have sent me ridiculous pictures over the web.  And the beach shots.  You go to the beach.  What do you see?  Oh.  But this is disgusting.  Well, we watched her for, like, a half hour.  It was hilarious.  It really was funny.  The stuff Ant was coming up with.  Yeah, I'm looking at the binoculars here.  Yeah, you stir that sauce, you old bitch.  You stir it.  You make that sauce.  I'm making my own sauce.  Yeah.  He was doing the Dirty Girl voice.  You remember that depression, don't you? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Doughboys are coming home again.  Yeah, I'm going to pound that old ass.  Stir that sauce.  Uh-oh.  Mm.  What kind of sauce?  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah, you old bitch.  Yeah, the only thing that sauce is missing is some Italian sausage.  I got it right there, you little bitch.  I'll help you stir that sauce.  Yeah, you're a filthy old whore. 
[02:45:30]  I'm watching you every night.  You've got to stir.  Why are you wearing a goddamn bathing suit stirring sauce?  Mm.  Oh, yeah.  Vagina.  Yeah.  Buttsy.  Yeah, you old bitch.  Well done.  We couldn't figure out why she was wearing a bathing suit as she made her sauce.  One of those old lady flowery bathing suits.  It was late at night, too.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  The whole scene was bizarre.  Yeah.  I love it when they're at the beach and they put on that old lady rubber bathing cap with  the little flowers on them, the little 3D stuck on flower head.  They tuck that big head up, like lacquered hair from the parlor.  I went to the parlor Saturday and I have to keep my hair nice.  Why don't you shower every day like normal people?  I went to the parlor.  How do old people, like, keep clean?  What do they do? 
[02:46:30]  Because they have their hair done once a month and they don't get it wet.  What's growing on grandma's head?  It's lacquered.  It's like I just put a chin guard and a face mask on there.  You've got a helmet.  Put a Major League, a Football League logo on the side of it.  But my grandma, God rest her soul, my nana, my father's mother, used to use just wonderful  hairspray.  And I swear to God, if she would have put the light switch up when she was spraying this 
[02:47:00]  stuff on, the whole house would have went up.  It was a fog.  It was a fog that if you walked in and say, hi, grandma, your eyes couldn't shut when you  walked out.  Everything was lacquered, plastered.  And she had this big bouffant, big bun, beehive hairdo on her head.  And us kids used to love touching it because it was just, it wasn't human.  It wasn't hair anymore.  A hair helmet.  It was a big, but it was piled up, Opie, like a foot off her head. 
[02:47:30]  Marge Simpson hair helmet.  Absolutely Marge Simpson hair helmet.  Oh, that's funny.  And she wouldn't wash it.  She would always talk about, oh, I'm going to the parlor a week from Tuesday.  Like, well, grandma, what are you doing for a week?  Yeah, it did.  It felt like one of those scrubbies that you use in your sink.  You know, the Brillo pads?  Not quite.  The plastic Brillo pads.  Oh, I don't know.  It's a scrubby.  It felt just like a scrubby.  My nanny, she used to have like a solution for everything. 
[02:48:00]  Some old world solution.  And she smelled like powder all the time because I guess she didn't shower because she had  to save the hair for the parlor.  So it was always baby powder.  And that was like her cure-all for anything that would happen to you.  Put some baby powder on it, Nana.  Put some baby powder on it.  And of course, my zits, you know.  I'd go through my teenage years and I'd go to dermatologists and Stridex and wash them  with soap and everything. 
[02:48:30]  She had the solution.  Baby powder.  Baby powder.  No, put Noxzema on it, Nana.  You know what Noxzema is?  It's like a moisturizing cream oil thing.  Yeah, that's really what I just put my face in a deep fryer.  Noxzema.  That was her cure-all.  Noxzema and baby powder.  Well, parents and grandparents especially have some wacky cures.  We would go out to Waiting River every summer.  Yeah.  And my parents, they just didn't believe in, you know, lotion. 
[02:49:00]  That tanning lotion.  Like any kind of sunblock.  Something.  Look how fair I am.  Yeah, you'd burn underneath a 20-watt light bulb.  Ridiculous.  So me and my brothers and sisters, we'd be let loose for the whole weekend out there in  Waiting River to the point that we were so burnt.  We were so red.  Like, we had the sunburn where it's on your eyelids.  Oh, you can't even move.  Behind your earlobes.  Under your neck over here.  Oh.  You would, like, you know, maybe lay in the sand and put your arms up like this.  So your underarms would be burnt to the point you can't move. 
[02:49:30]  Nothing worse than, yeah, your pits and behind your knees.  And then we'd have to sleep in Grandma's cots.  She had burlap army cots.  She had the burlap army cots because it was like that family compound.  She had a little house on the water there and stuff.  Nice and comfortable on the freshly burnt skin.  So me and my brothers and sisters and my cousins, we'd sleep on the cots, Anthony.  All over the place with the wool army blankets after burning all day.  And did any, like, sand from your hair get in the cot or something? 
[02:50:00]  The sand would be on the army cots and the wool blanket.  You're, like, rolling around on 20-grit sandpaper.  Oh, yeah.  And then we'd get home and we couldn't move.  We could not move.  We were so freaking burnt.  And my dad, my dad's cure for sunburn?  Yeah.  Vinegar.  What?  Vinegar.  Takes the sting out of sunburn.  Yeah, because it stings so bad it deadens the nerves.  Right.  We would be like, you know that sunburn where you just can't move and you take your shirt off? 
[02:50:30]  And you know the vinegar's going to be, like, ice cold, and then he would just rub vinegar all over you.  Yeah.  Oh.  That'll take the...  Vinegar?  That'll take the burnout.  Then you just stunk all night.  You were miserable and stunk.  Don't you think at some point they just opened up a cabinet and picked whatever they saw first and said,  this is what I know is good?  Yeah, put this on it.  This will take care of it.  Ah, really?  Maraschino cherries.  Right.  They've always got...  Bleach.  Clorox is the best thing for a burn. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Clorox.  Jell-O brand gelatin.  Just smear it on you.  Cloves.  Vinegar, though.  Vinegar on the sunburn.  Everyone's, like, writing in saying that their grandmas and nannies smelt like crap.  That's, like, an old-world thing, I guess, because they just didn't bathe.  Well, no, their hair stunk.  Yeah.  Because, like you said, they didn't wash it.  They would go to the parlor, so they wouldn't wash it until the next parlor visit.  The parlor.  The hair would stink from the chemicals and just not being washed. 
[02:51:30]  That big plastic hair dryer thing at the parlor.  Jesus Christ.  Remember those things?  Dude.  And they would pop it on top like the cone heads it would look like.  When does it go wrong, though?  Because, you know, those ladies were hot in their day.  Their husbands are all excited.  Hubba hubba 23 skidoo.  They come home every night.  They're banging away.  Yeah.  Having some of that, some of that, some of that there.  Oh.  Butts.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Some of that there.  Yes. 
[02:52:00]  Penises.  Vaginas.  Yeah.  Then what happens?  The years go by, and the next thing you know, like, they're going to the parlor?  They're not even washing.  And you're supposed to still be in love at that point?  Ugh.  You want to, you want to try to run your fingers through hair that's like, like a brick wall?  Pink!  Where does it go wrong?  Well, I remember there were a couple of times she had the in-between parlor visits where  she was trying, like she missed the parlor visit, and she tried to do something with 
[02:52:30]  her hair, and we'd go over to visit her, and she'd have two of those huge curlers.  You ever see those ones that are like the diameter of the 55-gallon drums?  And they'd be like, in the weirdest spot.  Like, Nana never had a curl there, ever.  But she put like, the big steel ones, like the, they were like that wire mesh thing, like  an accordion.  It's put there, so you can't see like the balding that's going on.  Oh, maybe that's it. 
[02:53:00]  Nana was doing the coma.  From all the hair that's falling out because of all the parlor visits.  Just wonderful.  I think my Nana is responsible for any hole in the ozone layer.  Just her.  The aerosol, I swear to God, you could not go near the bathroom when she was spraying this  stuff.  You'd smell it coming out from under the door.  And she'd be in there, lost in a fog.  Yeah.  Amazing.  And what old lady decided that, uh, that blue hair is hip?  Blue.  Yeah, where'd that come from? 
[02:53:30]  That's not a natural occurrence.  Someone had to start that trend.  Blue hair, Grandma.  Blue dots.  That's a good one.  Get, get to see the blue dots.  It looks so natural.  The sideways.  The sideways blue hair.  Sometimes, I guess, I guess you just give up.  You just give up.  All right, we got to take a break.  A lot of people liking your old lady stuff. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, 212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit. </pre>
