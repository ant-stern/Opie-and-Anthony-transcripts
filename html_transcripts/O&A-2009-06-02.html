<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a heated debate surrounding the murder of abortion doctor George Tiller.  The hosts and callers discussed the event's classification as terrorism, the role of media (specifically Fox News) in potentially influencing extremism, and the intense polarization surrounding abortion. This was followed by a discussion of a drive-by shooting at a Little Rock military recruiting station, prompting outrage from a caller, Paul, a former Green Beret, who questioned Reverend Al Sharpton's lack of public response.  The Air France flight 447 crash, Dick Cheney's support for gay marriage, Susan Boyle's mental breakdown, the perceived staging of an Eminem-Bruno Mars MTV VMA incident, the Yankees' baseball standing, and the return of a suspended radio host were also discussed, interspersed with numerous caller opinions and anecdotes.  The segment ended with criticism of the reality show "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!".

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the decline of traditional sitcoms and the rise of reality TV, along with a look at the exorbitant salaries of top TV stars like Oprah Winfrey (referred to derisively as a "snake oil salesman") and Dr. Phil. The hosts vowed to find a list of Oprah's promoted products during a commercial break. The conversation shifted to the premieres of Conan O'Brien and David Letterman's late-night shows and included a brief call from Kevin Smith, who was directing a film with Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan.  A significant portion focused on the "Thriller in Manila" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, including Ali's taunts and a comparison to Mike Tyson's ear-biting incident with Evander Holyfield (with a clarifying call about the headbutting incident).  This segment concluded with a phone interview with Joe Frazier himself, where he discussed his intense rivalry with Ali, including specific instances of Ali's insults and alleged threats (including pointing a gun at him), his boxing style, the three fights they had, his perspective on "Thriller in Manila," and his opinions on modern boxing personalities.

A substantial in-studio interview with Joe Frazier followed.  He detailed his boxing career, including the financial aspects (revealing instances of paying fighters and managers directly), his knockout record, and his impaired vision in one eye during the "Thrilla in Manila" due to implanted limbs. He discussed Ali's condition during that fight and the decision to stop it, their reconciliation after past resentments, a near-physical altercation on a talk show, his views on other fighters, and the state of modern boxing.  The interview touched upon his family, including the recent loss of a grandson, his family size, his website for merchandise, and some lighthearted banter with the hosts.  He also sang snippets of songs and a listener left a voicemail message for him. Don King and his business practices were briefly mentioned.

The show continued with a humorous, crude discussion about Dr. Steve's wine, allegedly made with liquefied ball warts.  Audio clips were played from a YouTube channel featuring a teenager with progeria, whose videos had been removed, prompting speculation about the reason.  A South Carolina caller discussed Joe Frazier's life and relationship with Ali. The hosts engaged in discussions of various celebrities and listener calls, with several callers sharing jokes and anecdotes. Joe Frazier, still in the studio, unsuccessfully attempted to record liners for the show due to incoherence. News stories covered included Nancy Reagan seeing her husband's ghost, the French Spider-Man scaling a Sydney tower, a car losing all four wheels, the discovery of plane crash debris, a zoo employee using degreaser in snow cones, and a father accused of biting out his son's eye.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a 750-pound woman whose removal from her home required a flatbed truck, provoking outrage.

The final segment began with discussions about upcoming Florida trips and Wellmont Theater ticket sales.  A caller, Dan, described winching a dead horse onto his truck and its subsequent disposal. Another caller, Brian from St. Louis, suggested a darkly humorous method for removing a deceased person from a house.  A video of a beached whale being blown up was discussed, speculated to be an early viral video.  Alan Robert's climbing activities were mentioned as an example of dangerous behavior. The show ended abruptly, acknowledging a large number of callers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Palaver, palaver, palaver, palaver.  Wow, that's cranked. That's cranked. Oh boy.  What, you good? No? I think I'm good.  I'm good. Got it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Systems go.  Oh, oh.  Good morning.  Oh, oh.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony.  We can start with two very serious phone calls. 
[00:00:30]  Serious?  One after another here on the old phone lines.  All right.  Get them out of the way.  Yeah, let's get it out of the way.  We never start with the listeners.  Let's go to Matt in Harlem.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA? Love you. Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, I don't mean to bring it down at this early in the morning,  but I'm surprised yesterday you guys didn't mention what happened on Sunday  with the abortion doctor, George Tiller, getting murdered in church.  Yeah.  I mean, to me, it's pretty fucked up just because of how, you know, 
[00:01:00]  what he was doing was for the benefit of the mother  and the eventually, you know, born disabled child or, you know, the one,  you know, it's just a messed up situation.  Well, yeah.  I mean, that abortion issue is a scary one.  You'll get lunatics on the right, these religious lunatics that think that  murdering in the name of the Lord is a great thing to do, and they're crazy. 
[00:01:30]  They're really kind of...  Fortunately, some of the boys in the Fox News Network encouraged, you know,  passively encouraged by calling him Tiller the Killer and, you know,  said he had blood in his hands way back when in 96.  Well, of course.  He got shot from doing this, so it's unfortunate that, you know,  you got guys that you can sometimes agree with in the Fox News Network  that it's unfortunate that, you know, they fuel the fire for these people  that just need the right reasons to do this stupid shit.  No, you can't even say it like that.  They don't fuel the fire for people.  Anyone who's going to pick up a gun and go kill an abortion doctor 
[00:02:00]  has got problems that go a lot farther than agreeing with Fox News  and them pushing them over the edge.  Come on, man.  I know, Jimmy, but it's just, you know, it's like you can't...  Out of all the things, domestic terrorism like that,  and because it is terrorism, because it's going to make other doctors  afraid to come out and say, I do this kind of practice,  because there's so many doctors that don't announce it.  There's only like two or three doctors that announce they do this practice,  and there's more of them that actually do it, that do it underhandedly. 
[00:02:30]  And when you have Fox News that kind of presents it and makes them, you know,  feel good about what they're doing, because they say they encourage the hatred of these doctors,  they're doing it for the benefit of human, you know, the mother.  There is a passive kind of encouragement that goes on on some of the programs on Fox News  and things like Fox News or just mailers from religious organizations  that are a little more, not as passive as Fox News is. 
[00:03:00]  You know, they're like, hey, yay, chalk one up for us kind of a thing.  But yeah, yeah.  It's the exact same kind of how committed they are to their task.  But that's the crazy side of, you know, the conservatives.  The liberals have their own crazy side that do the same, you know, kooky shit.  I mean, you're talking the extremes.  It's a religious extremist, man.  Yeah.  It's getting harder and harder to get an abortion, I'll tell you that much. 
[00:03:30]  This guy was well...  They did it in a fucking church.  They did it in a fucking church.  Well, that was the only place...  How did they do that?  Hold on.  That was the only place they could do it.  If you read anything about this doctor, he was well protected.  He had security 24 hours a day.  He had security cameras.  He had people walking him in and out of his practice.  So that was the only place they could get him.  The reason is because they say they did it for religious reasons, but they do it in a church...  Dude, you're looking for the...  Hold on.  You're looking for logic.  I mean, you know, the guy, obviously... 
[00:04:00]  I don't know logic, but it just...  It really inflames me that there's people like this in our own country where we pretend to be the higher calling,  you know, and then call other people barbarians.  But it's like, you know, we're fucking knee-deep in this shit.  But dude, a guy who would do that would kill a hitchhiker.  Or there's people murdered every day.  That's...  This is just...  It's like an issue that's never going to get solved in our country.  People are never going to agree on abortion.  So once in a while, some maniac is going to pull out a weapon. 
[00:04:30]  I think it was Eric Rudolph did it.  Once in a while, it's going to happen.  It's just too...  It's too big an issue for people to not occasionally get killed over.  I'm not saying that it's the way it is.  The difference between a maniac who kills a hitchhiker, Jimmy, and this guy, these guys,  these guys are heavily funded, like Anthony said, with the mailers and all that.  They plan it.  I mean, this is a true...  This is internal terrorism in its finest as far as, like, that kind of stuff.  Just like, you know, the Oklahoma City bombings.  I mean, it's not too much different.  This is the first one in 10 years, by the way.  The last one was in Buffalo.  It is different, though, because... 
[00:05:00]  I'm not saying it's not sickening, but it's one person killed every X amount of years.  I mean, again, I'm not demeaning it or saying it's not important, but you can't say it's  domestic terrorism.  And it's some crazy guy.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I disagree with you 100%.  I usually do agree with you.  You know, I'm not trying to take the word terrorism and put it out of context.  This is terrorism because it's going to make other doctors afraid to announce what they  do.  And there's tons of doctors who do this legally. 
[00:05:30]  He loves abortion.  Sir, I don't say you're wrong with the motive of it, but I'm saying the occasional wacko  who takes it to the extreme and kills somebody, I don't think you can classify as domestic  terrorism.  I think it happens too infrequently.  It's only just fundamentalism, which is a form of terrorism, if it's taken to the extreme  of killing somebody.  There's going to be less doctors doing this now, obviously.  Yes, and that's a form of terrorism to prevent the act of what they were killing for, to make  it people afraid. 
[00:06:00]  I mean, I know terrorism is, we have this thought of terrorism in war, but this is terrorism.  But the papers are reporting there's a doctor already taking this guy's place.  I think he packed his bags from another town and he's moving in.  He's moving in to take over.  He's not being afraid.  How many bitches you knock up?  Yeah, Jesus, you must have a potent load, Matt.  Why are you so invested?  Matt loves his abortion.  Well, let's just say it's thicker than tapioca.  No condoms, Matt. 
[00:06:30]  I use the Anthony Cumia method.  That's it.  Pull that off with a thumb.  Oh, I thought you meant too young to get pregnant.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  Yeah, he's right.  We didn't touch on that one yesterday.  That's a heavy one, man.  He's very passionate.  Like Jimmy said, that will never be solved.  Obama had a good statement about abortion.  He was saying like abortion.  Yeah, I like what he said about people who, like, because someone was shouting him down  when he was speaking.  And he said that, look, we're never going to agree on this.  It's like you're never going to agree on it. 
[00:07:00]  So the key is just not to reduce the opposition to a caricature.  It was some really smart point he made about it.  That's kind of, yeah, that makes sense.  Because it's never, they will never, it's a death penalty.  You'll never have an agreement.  Yeah.  You can have discussions on it, but you're never going to, at the end of the conversation,  have the guy go, you're right.  I've changed my point of view.  Those arguments are just exhausting.  I know.  Because no one changes their stance whatsoever.  No.  They don't even move a little bit.  A little bit.  And yeah, I did say it's getting tougher and tougher to get abortions.  Yes. 
[00:07:30]  Yes, I did.  Where do you pick one up?  I need to get an abortion.  Sarah Silver had a great joke.  She's like, I want to get an abortion, but I'm trying to get pregnant first.  We've got to go get you one of those abortions.  And we've got another heavy story coming in from Paul the Trucker.  Paul, starting differently today on the OPN Anthony Show.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, man.  Yeah, this is Paul, the former Green Beret.  We have spoken before.  My good pal Anthony, listen, I am just really angry with this. 
[00:08:00]  I want to use so many words to describe this individual, but out of being nice, I will not  use them.  Go ahead.  So I don't get the bell.  I'll just say, piece of shit, Muslim convert that decided to take it upon himself and drive  by the recruiting station and gunned down from soldiers yesterday in Little Rock, Arkansas,  killing a young white private.  Now, where is Reverend Al with the outrage today?  I don't hear him.  I hear crickets. 
[00:08:30]  I didn't even hear about it.  Not racially motivated?  Yeah, really?  What kind of story is that?  I didn't even hear about it.  I didn't even hear about it.  No, this was a big one, too.  Wow.  Recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas, two guys.  I guess there's something in the Army where right after basic training, you could come  home for a couple of weeks if you work at a recruiting office.  Yes, it's called the Hometown Recruiter.  I did it when I was a private.  So it gives you an opportunity to come home after basic training, see your family and friends.  You're still working for the Army, but you work at the recruiting office. 
[00:09:00]  And it was a drive-by shooting.  Two guys got shot, right?  Yes, it was a white private and a young Hispanic private.  The white private died.  This guy, his last name was originally, his last name was Bledsoe, I believe, but he was  a Muslim convert, drove by, opened fire with an SKS rifle, killing the young white private,  severely wounding the young Hispanic.  They caught him a few miles away. 
[00:09:30]  He had all kinds of items in his vehicle that said another pistol, another rifle, some type  of explosive.  And he basically said, yeah, I did it.  I did it for political and religious reasons.  And they're charging him right now with murder, terroristic actions, and something else.  And I'm just sitting there going, this scumbag should just be beaten to death.  But where's Reverend Al with the outrage?  This is your, here we have a targeted crime. 
[00:10:00]  Well, it's a black guy.  Well, it's a black guy.  So you won't hear, when black guy's the perpetrator, you won't hear Reverend Al.  We need a white Reverend Al.  It just doesn't happen.  I mean, I think Reverend Al is almost ready to admit to everybody that he only cares about  black issues.  Yeah.  Because it's becoming so blatantly obvious.  This young soldier got killed here in the United States by someone wanting to be a terrorist  and haven't even started his life yet.  And it's just enraging.  Well, now he'll lawyer up and he'll be fine. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then his dad, I guess his dad was in Memphis, this scumbag.  And, oh, I have no comment.  No, why don't you have a comment to what your son did?  Have a comment.  Say, hey, what my son did was wrong.  I don't condone it.  But, no, I already see it right now.  Oh, they're persecuting my son.  Oh, they're treating him so bad.  I just see the whole scenario playing out, as Anthony would say it.  It is a normal routine whenever they do something wrong.  Yeah, yeah.  The lawyers will just talk about the poor upbringing and the confusion and poor, poor guy. 
[00:11:00]  And then hopefully he'll get life in prison or the death penalty anyway.  How many guns are we up to now, Ant?  I don't know.  I lost count a while back.  A lot, suffice to say, a lot.  I wanted to share something with you real quick.  My girlfriend's father just recently acquired a Luftwaffe officer's pistol.  I took a look at it.  Of course, I'm looking for the stamping.  And there it was right there on the side of the barrel lug, my friend. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, you need the old stamping on there, if you know what I mean.  All right, take it easy.  Have a good day, boys.  See you, man.  Ammo seems to be the big problem these days, acquiring ammunition.  A lot of people stocking up, so it's hard to get.  I'd buy online now.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a pretty heavy story, too.  I didn't hear about that.  Oh, yeah.  That was a biggie yesterday.  Well, the plane kind of took over everything yesterday.  Yeah, that pushed a bunch of the stories off the front page.  The big story, the big Air France jetliner. 
[00:12:00]  They're starting to say this is a rare one.  Yeah.  Severe weather, taking a plane out of the sky is very, very rare.  Yeah, it's rare these days.  And that's what they're hinting at.  The A330 Airbus, no commercial accidents in 14 years with this plane.  Wow.  Very, very safe aircraft.  You know what?  You just bummed me out so bad.  Why?  Usually when I see a plane go down, I go, well, it's in another country. 
[00:12:30]  That means we sold them our old plane, so, you know, we got newer planes, they got our  old planes, and, of course, they're supposed to crash now.  This plane went into service, this particular plane went into service in 2005.  Oh, great.  Relatively bad.  Wonderful.  The planes itself, the A330, came out like 98, 1998.  Yeah, it's a relatively safe plane.  Oh, great.  But they fly, there's apparently this area of intertropical convergence between Africa 
[00:13:00]  and South America, a little jet stream by the equator there that really is volatile.  I mean, you get thunderstorms that are rising up to 50,000 feet.  You're taking off, you're trying to climb, and you're going through these storm clouds like  this.  It's over, Johnny.  You know what it's supposed to be?  That's supposed to be a hurricane. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But because of where it sits on Earth.  It's not cooked yet.  Well, but it's on the equator, so it just kind of, it can't.  It has no spin yet until it gets north or south of the equator.  Exactly.  Equator.  Exactly.  But basically, that is the start of a hurricane that never really forms because of where it's  located on the Earth.  But it's just a massive, massive weather disturbance.  You get those low-pressure areas.  Because when they start creeping north, they get that counterclockwise rotation, and that's 
[00:14:00]  when the shenanigans start with the hurricanes.  But this is just massive thunderstorms, and this plane apparently was flying right into  it.  Real heavy turbulence.  And then they had catastrophic electrical failures.  Oof.  How do they know all that already?  A number of them.  I guess the plane, you know, twitters to headquarters.  That's pretty much what the plane does now.  It talks to Air France. 
[00:14:30]  It sent an email and said, oh, our electronics are really screwing up here.  Do you think that was the lightning strike?  It could have been the lightning strike.  It could have been the turbulence that shook something loose.  It might have been, they say, usually a lightning strike on a plane does no more than make  a dent the size of a quarter in the side of a plane, maybe.  They're built to take lightning strikes.  I would hope so.  They're fucking metal flying through clouds.  Yeah.  Jeez, that sucks if they just hope they miss it.  Yeah.  It's hard to avoid a lightning bolt. 
[00:15:00]  We were watching a video of a plane getting struck by lightning yesterday.  It's amazing.  Oh, really?  And nothing happened to the plane.  It kind of just moved around quickly in the sky, and then it was back in its flight pattern  within a second.  You know what?  They may have actually just had an electrical failure that was lightning or may not have  been lightning.  It could have just been a fucking problem.  If these things don't go down to 14 years, eventually it's going to go down.  It could have just been a combination of a lot of stuff.  They said that they're not going to get to the crash site until Wednesday.  This happened yesterday morning. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Well, they'll finally get there tomorrow.  And tomorrow, a pilot that was coming into the airport reported seeing an orange glow  on the surface of the water, which now he knows was a burning plane or pieces of it.  So, yeah, I guess they got to get the troops together, get them out there.  But I don't know what they're going to find.  They're not going to find shit.  And they're not going to find the black box because I was reading it's deep water.  And you were telling me, what, 9,000 feet? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, something like that.  Very, you know, deep enough where the wreckage, they say the plane wreckage, might never be  recovered at this point.  And a lot of the victims also not recovered.  One of those things where, you know, family's got to go on the boat with the wreaths and  throw them in because, hmm.  What else are you going to do?  You're not really going to find people.  Like, you don't know.  Like, you're taking off from Rio, right?  You're going home and you're thinking about, all right, I've got to get to work tomorrow. 
[00:16:30]  I had a great vacation.  You don't realize that your body is now never going to be recovered.  Like, I'm leaving Rio right now.  I am going to spend the rest of eternity 10,000 feet in the ocean.  You're just going to disappear and be pretty much eaten by fish.  But I've thought about that.  Does it really matter to have your body recovered?  I guess it's for the family that continues living.  Want to have somewhere to go?  Yeah.  Cry?  But you as a...  Touch the stone with your hand and go, poor little feller.  Well, we do it for the living because I think you as a human being, you're like, all right, 
[00:17:00]  well.  Jesus.  You know.  What are you going to do?  That's a big lightning that hits that plane.  Let's say hi to Dan in Ohio.  Dan.  Dan.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hi.  Hey, I wanted to call out that first guy who called in about the boy in Fox News.  That was exactly Keith Overman's point on his show on Monday night.  He went on a half-hour rant calling out Fox News and specifically Bill O'Reilly, which  I'm not a big fan of, but calling him for a fuel in the flame and calling him killer the 
[00:17:30]  killer and all that, trying to blame it all on Fox News and trying to say that it's all  their fault, basically.  Why is it Fox News' fault?  I don't know.  Keith Overman is the biggest douchebag.  And I guess if I really had to sit here and think about it, Keith Overman, Bill O'Reilly,  I'd probably lean more toward what Keith Overman represents.  But he is such an asshole that I want Bill O'Reilly to kick his ass. 
[00:18:00]  And Bill O'Reilly's a dick.  Yeah.  But Keith Overman is that guy you hated in school.  Yeah.  It's known that Fox News leans a little more conservative than every other news organization.  Well, MSNBC does a nice job leaning the other way.  But I guess there is a responsibility to not incite.  If you look at something and it's inciting people to murder other people based on religious 
[00:18:30]  beliefs, that's pretty fucking crazy.  That's nuts.  But I don't think that's what they're doing, especially somebody who's perhaps a responsible  broadcaster.  I don't know.  Are there any over there?  Keith is such a tough guy when that camera's on.  Oh.  Yeah.  Do you guys watch him?  No.  I've watched him to beat.  I've watched him to get pissed off.  They can just get mad.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's too smart. 
[00:19:00]  That guy's a pit bull.  He's a douche.  A boo.  A boo.  Let's say hi to Russ, the trucker.  Russ, what are you hauling today?  I got some turbine parts.  Turbine parts?  Yeah.  I got me some turbine parts.  Who the hell needs turbine parts?  Oh, well.  ADF.  Nah.  Anyway, I got that.  You're talking about the airplane?  Yesterday, we were talking about they're making them out of a new capacity. 
[00:19:30]  It's lighter and stronger.  And the problem is it doesn't take it like the aluminum bodies used to take it.  And it finds components and burns them up.  And that's the problem.  After they're talking about yesterday, some expert came on.  And they think that's what happened to the plane.  That sounds silly.  That just sounds silly.  Yeah.  Well, that's great.  I ain't no expert, but that's what they're talking about on the news.  Yeah.  You know what's weird?  I was thinking of going to France, too.  So. 
[00:20:00]  Really?  Wow.  Could have been you if you went to Rio de Janeiro first.  That's what I'm thinking.  On that flight.  What if that was the only flight I could get?  I had to go to Rio first.  And then France.  And you'd have had a problem.  Yeah.  We all think that, though.  Come on.  Yeah.  Maybe this one's a little, you know, a little rough to connect yourself to.  But every disaster.  Who did the joke, Colin Quinn?  Colin Quinn.  9-11.  But it's so true.  We all do it.  Every single one of us. 
[00:20:30]  After 9-11, people always try to connect themselves to it.  People are like, oh, God, if I would have taken the two train that day.  Do you normally take the two train?  No, I've never taken the two train in my life.  Yeah, yeah.  He's calling.  He's like, you know, man, that day something told me not to go down there.  He goes, yeah, stupid.  The news.  The news told you not to go down there.  The news.  Colin had the best 9-11 stuff.  Plane had zero radar coverage when it went down.  All right.  Well, we're going to learn more about the plane.  Of course we are.  There was something else from yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  Now I can't remember.  Very frightening.  Oh, what about this?  This is called throwing the ball around.  I guess it's something we're starting to really get into with the show.  Where the phones light up with, like, current events.  We just kind of throw the ball around a little bit to begin.  Dick Cheney.  Yeah.  What a douchebag.  Yeah, he's...  I'll tell you why.  Dick Cheney says he supports gay marriage now.  Yeah.  Where was he when he was in office with Bush?  Hiding.  Hiding, not commenting, hinting that he hates the gays. 
[00:21:30]  Exactly.  But now that he's not in office, you know, he's got a gay daughter.  He's all rah, rah, rah about gay marriage.  Yep.  These politicians suck.  You don't know what they really think until they're out of office.  Now he's out because he's got the lesbian daughter.  I guess he figures...  Yeah, I'll come out and say...  But they were begging for him to give a comment about gay marriage and gay rights and just gays in general. 
[00:22:00]  Gay.  And he just blew it off and kind of hinted that, you know...  He blew it off?  Kind of hinted that he wasn't into it.  Yeah, it's one of those weird situations where it's like, where were you when you were in office?  Why didn't you speak up then?  You get this with every politician after they leave.  Oh, yeah.  Then they become very brave with what they can say.  And, yeah, that one's... 
[00:22:30]  That's a touchy situation, though.  Fucking vice president to one of the most religious presidents we ever had.  George W.  Yeah.  Using, you know, his religion to influence his presidency and how he did things, which is infuriating whenever you saw that.  His Christian values.  Your job.  Great.  Oh, the worst.  Let me bring religion into that.  You're not a fan of the Christian values? 
[00:23:00]  No.  You know, if you want to have them in your own house, that's fine.  Bring them to your goddamn job when you're the president?  Not so good.  No, no, no.  Because you're supposed to represent more than just Christians.  Yeah, yeah.  When you're in office.  You're supposed to represent everything.  You know, it's Christian values.  It's our job as Christians.  Yeah.  It's our job as Christians to go over there and help those people.  No, it's not.  Mm-hmm.  For what?  Why?  You're a Christian.  We're doing the marriage protection bill to protect marriage from the homosexuals. 
[00:23:30]  Really?  Talk to your vice president.  Apparently he's all for it.  Well, now we're learning that.  Yeah.  And he's also a big fan of Susan Boyle.  What the fuck happened to Dick Cheney?  Dick Cheney.  Is he crying at movies now, too?  Dick Cheney basically says...  Cheney turned into a fruit.  Yes, the gay marriage.  And he's kind of bummed Susan Boyle lost, so...  Wow.  I don't know what's going on there.  A goof-goop for him.  And you know what?  We could seg right into Susan Boyle.  Ah, what's wrong with her? 
[00:24:00]  She's lost her mind?  Is that what we're getting at?  Well, I thought she went to the hospital for kind of like an exhaustion thing, but now  they're hinting, eh, she's going to be there for 21 days minimum.  Really?  Dude.  The 21-day minimum thing.  Let me tell you something.  Which means that, you know, they think she might be nuts.  Let me tell you something about this woman, and you could see it right off the bat.  She's a kook.  She's kooky.  And she's this school marm-looking thing. 
[00:24:30]  Never got the time of day from anybody in her life, I'm sure.  She gets on this show, and all of a sudden she's, you know, number two as far as most  recognizable face next to Obama.  Is that...  Well, I'm, you know, exaggerating perhaps a bit.  Maybe not.  She's very, you know, well-known.  Who's more recognizable than Obama at this point?  Jim Norton.  I mean, not Obama, than Susan Boyle.  Let me think.  Who would you put on that list? 
[00:25:00]  More recognizable just by walking down the street and looking and going, hey...  Queen of England.  Yeah, she's pretty recognizable.  Yeah, that dumb head.  You can't miss that.  Brad Pitt.  Yeah, there's a lot of movie stars, I think.  Movie stars.  Spoils of pop culture, like a thing, but...  Muhammad Ali.  Simon Cowell.  Yeah.  Ali.  Simon Cowell.  George Foreman.  What's some of the other celebrities that are well-known?  There's people in Africa who have never heard of this woman.  Speaking of Muhammad Ali, we're going to get into it later, but I've completely changed 
[00:25:30]  camps.  I'm on Team Joe Frazier starting today.  Starting today.  I don't know about change camps, but I...  I have to change camps.  I loved this special.  Loved the...  I mean, the movie.  It's fucking phenomenal.  We got Frazier coming in, and yeah, there's a movie out, a documentary on the Thrilla in  Manila.  Yeah.  And wow, Frazier made his points very nicely.  I would like to hear Muhammad Ali's side of the story, but then again, who could read 
[00:26:00]  what he's talking?  Yeah, I'm looking forward to speaking to him.  Yeah.  Because he's coming.  What time is he coming on?  8.30.  8.30.  We got the Frazier guy.  Back to Boyle.  We can talk about Frazier after the break.  So what were you saying?  I'm saying so then she's all popular, and then she just loses her mind.  She comes in second.  And then I think it all sunk in finally. 
[00:26:30]  I think she was distracted by the show and everything she had to do to see where she ended  up.  But now that the show's over and stuff, I think she just kind of lost her mind a little bit.  20, they committed her.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Well, she went from a nobody to just uber stardom.  And she's still, you know, kind of funny looking.  So she doesn't have that going for her.  Boyle was beaten by a dance group called Diversity.  She seemed to take the defeat in good grace. 
[00:27:00]  But the strain was etched on Boyle's face as she left the studio later that night with  a huge bouquet of flowers.  Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden spoke to our Les Trent about the pressure Boyle  has been under.  She didn't sleep.  She wasn't eating.  I saw her just before she went on to stage.  And I hugged her and I asked her how she was.  And she said she felt very tired and that she felt sick with nerves.  And she was worried she was going to be sick.  According to one report, right after she lost, Boyle was heard shouting,  I hate this show. 
[00:27:30]  She is also said to have thrown a cup of water at a studio crew member who tried to calm her down.  Soon after, it was revealed that Boyle had been taken by ambulance to the Priory,  a celebrity rehab and retreat in London.  We're being told by her doctors that she's basically worn out.  She's exhausted.  She's exhausted.  She was a fucking fat Edith Bunker looking nobody.  And now she's one of the most famous people on the planet.  I mean, yeah, she's fucking, she's a little bit of a breakdown. 
[00:28:00]  Even British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was alarmed by the news about her breakdown.  I talked to the Prime Minister last night and he was very concerned about Susan.  He'd heard what had happened and wanted to make sure she was okay.  During the live finale itself, Boyle's behavior had raised eyebrows.  After being praised for her performance, she buried her face in her hand and made a strange  chopping motion to her neck.  And in an after-show interview, Boyle seemed confused.  I think you're just as much fun watching it as you did. 
[00:28:30]  It's just as much fun, actually, on the program when you watch it.  Before Boyle's health crisis, she was scheduled to be part of a tour by all of the finalists  later this month.  Her fans are keeping their fingers crossed that she'll make it.  Her fans?  I think it helps her that she's nuts.  Who wouldn't want to see this Kathy Bates character singing like that?  She'll come out in 21 days, dude.  Everyone will want to talk to her.  Yeah.  Everyone will want to talk to her.  She'll be fine.  She'll make a lot of money. 
[00:29:00]  She's rich.  She is going to do just fine.  Crazy old English broad.  She's Scottish.  Scottish.  Whatever she is.  Same thing.  Old nuts.  By the way, until you go over there and visit, they're all the same.  You know, you go over there and then they'll explain the differences.  Yes there, Jimmy.  That's in the Daily News.  Can a fucking newspaper get priorities?  Page two.  Conan O'Brien taking over the Tonight Show.  Page three.  They're fat factors.  Talking about how fatty foods are. 
[00:29:30]  And, oh, we've got GM on page four and five.  Page six.  Spits it with hookers.  And page seven.  Math scores rising.  Oh, yeah.  Page eight.  Plane vanished.  And one soldier killed by Muslim in Arkansas.  Yeah.  Can the fucking Daily News not behave like a total rag?  Prioritize a little bit.  You're still supposedly a newspaper.  Act like it.  Assholes.  Absolutely.  Yeah, big front page with Yankees on the front.  Yeah, let's...  Nick of time.  Guy hit a double. 
[00:30:00]  Gives a shit.  Let's go to 33 across from Pennsylvania.  He's got a little more on the Dick Cheney thing.  33, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, it's just like Al Gore.  He was vice president for eight years.  And now, all of a sudden, his priorities are the environment.  He had the perfect place, you know, the perfect soapbox to get something done.  And now, he is totally, you know, now he's totally green.  It doesn't make any sense.  Even after the guy who ran for president. 
[00:30:30]  Well, if you want to know what these guys really think, just wait for them to get out of office.  And then, you know, they sign the big book deal.  And then, they tell you exactly what they think on all these issues.  Yeah.  Because they have to toe the damn party line.  You know, everything.  They're just looking for the next job.  Because he was running for president.  Right.  And then, he had a shot at the Nobel.  Actually, he won the Nobel Prize.  And what happens next?  Dad, don't need to be the president.  I got a better gig now.  And let's not forget, Al Gore is a bloody millionaire from going after the environment thing. 
[00:31:00]  He has made so much fucking money.  It's great business right here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Great business.  You know what he brings in for, like, speaking engagements?  It's got to be 20, 30 bucks.  You think so?  Yeah, easy.  I would have thought of it more.  But the thing is, I don't know what to think.  Because, like, I got like Chaney.  Do you respect him because he does what his party wants him to do?  Like, we get mad when politicians allow their personal shit to influence too much of their policy. 
[00:31:30]  Like, hey, you're here to represent us.  Do what we want.  But if they don't allow too much of their personal thing, it's we kind of accuse them of being phony.  It's kind of a...  But I would imagine for the gay movement, if you got someone like Dick Cheney in office coming out and saying,  hey, you know, obviously my daughter's gay.  I'm for this gay marriage thing.  That's huge.  So you've got to think the gay community's not too happy with him doing it after he's out of office.  Yeah.  Well, probably better than not at all. 
[00:32:00]  Huh?  Probably better than not at all, though.  Yeah, I guess.  I don't think gay marriage thing.  There's too many people in this country that are...  Did you hear the...  A little intolerant.  Did you hear what Bush said?  What did Bush say?  Bush basically admitted that Laura Bush wouldn't have voted for him if she wasn't married to him.  Really?  Basically saying she doesn't really agree with...  She doesn't agree with all his shit.  With all the stuff he's into.  With his horse shit. 
[00:32:30]  All these politicians in the last couple of days, a lot of interesting things.  Yeah.  Did you see good old Joe Biden decide he needed to hang out on the Jersey Shore?  Did you see that picture yet?  No.  Oh, my God.  You've got to see the Joe Biden picture.  You know, he decided he needed a little beach vacation, so he took his little beach chair  with his wife and went to the Jersey Shore.  He is...  I think it was the same weekend that Obama was in New York doing his thing. 
[00:33:00]  He's really an invisible vice president.  They're going to get rid of him.  I mean, he doesn't...  Mark my word on that.  Anytime you see or hear from him, it's because he said something, you know...  Stupid.  And tripped over, you know, his tongue.  Yeah.  But now, uh...  What does he do?  He goes to the Jersey Shore.  He's like, what do you want to do today?  I don't know.  I'm the vice president.  Well, the party figured they needed him to get Obama elected.  Oh, God.  Now that Obama's elected, they don't need this guy.  So he'll hang out for three and a half more years, whatever it's going to be, and then 
[00:33:30]  they'll get some other guy if Obama gets a second term.  I don't know.  I don't think you cut the vice president.  I think if you have the ticket that works...  I also think that they like that he's got a big mouth because he takes the attention of  Obama.  He's not doing anything stupid.  That's true.  He'll say some stupid shit and people focus on him and not the president.  Yeah.  What site has that?  TMZ.  TMZ.com has the Biden pictures.  I would love to know what's going on out of frame of that picture. 
[00:34:00]  You think there's just a million Secret Service and all that?  Secret Service laying on the beach in suits trying to fit in.  You're standing in the water frolicking with guns.  He's got his one finger in his ear by the earpiece talking into his wrist in ankle deep  water.  That picture makes it look like Biden just decided to go to the Jersey Shore and a tourist  just happened to go, oh my God, that's the vice president.  I wish I could see what else is going on on that beach. 
[00:34:30]  Do you think he had a little section closed off for himself?  Yeah.  Which is just awkward, right?  Yeah.  I don't see anyone else in any shot there.  Yeah.  We go to Adam in Boston.  Adam?  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Hey, how are the Red Sox doing?  Um, just out of first place.  Did the Yankees win last night or yesterday?  I don't know.  I guess.  Isn't it true that the Yankees are in first place for the first time in how many years?  Which I found amazing.  Yeah, it's been a little while. 
[00:35:00]  Like, could someone tell me what year?  Travis saying it's since 2006.  2006.  So for the first time in three years, the Yankees have solo possession of first place.  Damn, yeah.  Isn't that weird?  I thought they would.  First time since when?  Since like 2006.  It's been three years.  Yeah.  It was 92 to 2006 that they were in first place also.  How's our old pal, Mayor Menino?  What a joke.  That guy's disgusting, isn't he?  Has he done anything stupid lately? 
[00:35:30]  Well, every day he does something stupid.  We just don't get to see it.  You know, it's an embarrassment.  You know, we hang our heads when we hear that guy talk.  The other thing about Boston, Jay Severin, we were wrong about him.  He did his suspension and he's back on the air.  Oh, really?  Not fired?  I listen to you guys in the morning, so I don't even know who that is.  Jay Severin, pretty popular talk show host up there.  Yeah, I've heard of him.  What the fuck did he say?  He said, uh...  Made fun of Mexicans or something?  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  I forgot what it was and we were all about.  He's so fired, but you know what?  Thought he was.  They sat him out for a good month and now he's back and I applaud the company.  I like that strategy.  For sure it's the right thing to do.  Yeah, but the radio companies never, you know, back your guy.  Never back you.  Uh-oh, it's one for the good guys then, right?  They're bastards.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think I'm a fan of his.  I've heard him a few times, whatever, but I'm glad that they didn't fire him over something.  Yeah, they sat it out. 
[00:36:30]  Over his opinion.  What's he supposed to do?  Sit it out.  He called Mexicans primitives?  Yeah, that's right.  Is that what he did?  Right.  That's right.  That Mexican rant about...  Primitive culture and all that.  Mexico being, uh, yeah.  It's not a huge stretch.  Third world country.  Well, a lot of...  No.  A lot of people had the same opinion, so...  Of course.  All right, Adam, what do you got today?  Well, listen, I think I found out exactly what happened to that plane.  Oh.  Um, apparently it needed some aesthetic work and the stupid French painted it with that exploding paint. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, Jesse, you're in short.  They, uh, used exploding paint.  What was the paint called again?  I'm a Navy SEAL.  It was a...  Oh, my.  A third night.  They mixed it up with the thermite paint.  While people were putting their luggage...  I know.  Shut up.  In the luggage bins, they were painting the inside of the plane.  God, is he just...  That was it.  Right.  The beauty of Jesse, he was the governor. 
[00:37:30]  I know.  You think about it.  When you see him, you're like, oh, my God, he was the governor of a state.  And he's just nutty as a fruitcake.  Ron has more on Dick Cheney.  Ron, Illinois, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Of course you do.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All you guys are giving Cheney too much credit.  All he said was that he supports states' rights to choose whether or not gay marriage should be legal.  But he has not come out and answered whether or not he supports gay marriage.  Wow. 
[00:38:00]  The paper I was reading this morning spun it slightly different than that.  Was that a diner placemat, Opie?  No, it was a newspaper.  Okay, just checking.  Never know.  Check it out.  All right.  We'll look into that a little further there, sir.  Thank you.  Jimmy?  And by the way, about this guy who killed this abortion doctor, the man charged with  doing it, he was described yesterday as a mentally ill extremist who believes in an eye  for an eye for a tooth for a tooth.  His ex-wife said he never thought of himself as mentally ill, but everyone else did. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  His anti-abortion rhetoric was very strong, and it's one of the things that made it her  – and even his brother said, well, we always thought of him as a kind and loving son and  brother and father who suffered from mental illness.  So everyone around this guy knew he was fucking crazy.  So again, it's like these guys that shoot abortion doctors are fucking nuts.  It's like a guy that shoots somebody because he thinks they're the devil or a serial killer  that goes out and kills only a certain type of woman because it reminds him of someone 
[00:39:00]  else.  Like, it's that kind of craziness.  That's all serial killers kind of, though.  They kind of stick to one thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so – but stuff like that, it doesn't necessarily mean it's some organized thing.  I know there are people that, you know, they do call for the murder of abortion doctors.  But as far as having this real organized thing, boy, I think that would be nipped in the  bud pretty quick. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Have some kind of organized group like that that advocates killing.  Imagine if all of a sudden the anti-abortionists just changed their tact, the pro-lifers, and  they started protesting and yelling, suck his dick!  And all they said to do is suck the dick of the abortion doctor.  He'd be just too embarrassed to go to work.  Suck his big, delicious cock!  Suck his big, delicious cock!  I can't go to work.  This is humiliating.  What did one of the leaders of the pro-life movement say about this?  I don't know. 
[00:40:00]  It was pretty – I want the exact quote.  He was basically saying that the guy got what he deserved.  Really?  I don't want to – we've got to find the exact quote.  Yeah, because, boy, that would be –  I mean, it's a little deeper than that.  Ooh.  Yeah.  It's a little extreme.  Of course it is.  And finally, before we take our first break, mainstream media kind of jumping on the old  bandwagon that that Bruno Eminem thing is a stage thing. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, okay.  Finally.  Took him a day.  Did they do a little investigative reporting?  Took him a – they're finally looking at the tape and saying everything we said after  seeing it one time.  Yeah.  You can watch it once.  But they're studying it, and they're still not sure.  And it's so obvious.  Of course it is.  God.  Ridiculous.  We're a little more savvy these days.  Yeah, yeah.  When you see a camera on Eminem before it happens, like, uh-oh, and Eminem's, like, scared like  this. 
[00:41:00]  He's not going to drop on me, is he?  You know what it comes from?  It was some honeymooners acting there.  Yeah.  I'm going to – you know where it comes from?  It really does.  It comes from reality shows, like scripted reality shows, where people watch these things  and think it's like the real world was season one, I'm talking.  Mm-hmm.  You know, where they did just pop cameras in and let people go off on each other and things  like that.  And it's not like that anymore.  So when you watch these reality shows, they're scripted, so they're fake, and you see, like, 
[00:41:30]  they'll cut to somebody before something happens.  Yep.  And you'll be like, wow!  Look at that!  Yeah.  Lucky they cut to him.  Yeah.  You know, it's all set up and fake.  So when this happened with Eminem and they cut to him while Bruno is still 25 feet in  the air, wasn't that a little suspicious?  And he flips perfectly into, like, a wrestling position?  Yeah, yeah.  And comes down right with his ass in Eminem's face. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  And then the fact that he didn't get the shit beat out of him.  MTV blew it.  They were going for a moment – well, everyone's talking about it, so maybe they didn't blow  it.  Yeah, yeah.  But, I mean, if you're going to do that, why not just have Bruno fall on him awkwardly  without a perfect positioning of the ass two inches from Eminem's face?  And don't show Eminem getting up and walking out either.  Like, cut and go right to a commercial.  Right.  Right.  Make it look like it's one of those things. 
[00:42:30]  They played it out.  Like, the camera's right there.  And why would Eminem agree to do this?  Because he's – I mean, there are rappers that don't like Eminem that are going to use  this against him.  Basically saying, you had man ass in your face.  Yeah, but it's Bruno.  Huh?  Yeah, but it's Bruno's ass.  It's almost a rite of passage.  Really?  And, like, look, they're just pushing him away.  They would have – they'd be fisting him.  And I love the reaction shots of the dummies in the audience that are thinking that –  The big celebrities. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, that think it might be real.  Yeah, he's got bodyguards that take up that doorway behind Jimmy, and they're going to just  spin him around like, you know, getting a pinata ready to get hit.  Wouldn't they just beat the shit out of him?  Of course they would.  What do they have to lose?  Their whole job is to protect Eminem and his credibility.  It's so obviously fake.  No, it's real.  I swear.  It's excellent acting.  But they're finally –  Great improv.  How did your ropes break? 
[00:43:30]  And the microphone, Eminem was mic'd.  Yeah.  Someone's saying, no, not really.  You know, the audio was picked up from Bruno's mic.  Well, Bruno was –  Bruno's face was buried in Eminem's crotch.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like under his chair.  Yeah, unless they had Bruno's ass, you know, light.  He had a microphone in his asshole that Eminem was talking into.  And, wow, what a coincidence.  These two guys both have huge projects coming out.  Yeah, yeah.  Got the Bruno movie and the Eminem CD. 
[00:44:00]  It couldn't be some other celebrity that has nothing going on right now.  Yeah.  Has to be these guys.  It's all just a load of shit.  Everyone's laughing behind them.  But it just pissed me off that the mainstream media was, like, hinting that this is real for a while.  And why is Eminem just sitting back like he's getting a lap dance, not allowed to touch the dancer?  His head is kind of back, but his arms are to his side.  Wouldn't you be grabbing the guy's, like, boots and just shoving them off you and trying to get out of your seat?  Dude, you would lose your mind. 
[00:44:30]  Why don't we do the experiment on the show and see how we handle it?  Cool.  No one is going to sit there.  What do you want to be?  I'll sit in the seat.  Oh, get those ropes for yourself.  No one's sitting in that seat for more than a second before all hell would break loose.  Yeah.  You would be fucking punching him in his ball bag.  Of course.  You'd be squirming trying to get out from under him.  You wouldn't just sit there talking, oh, man, what the fuck is this?  Oh.  People seem to think that this whole thing happened in slow motion. 
[00:45:00]  Like, if I saw a naked man ass, like, slowly ascending from the ceiling, I could put my hands up and go, oh, get out of here.  And, you know, yeah, yeah, push him away.  You don't just sit there and go, oh, what is this coming down on me?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, he sounded like he was locked in his chair.  Right.  Yeah, you would get out of your seat.  Anything.  Anything is right.  Especially with all those bodyguards around.  I mean, they would notice something was awry and, you know, push the guy off.  I mean, yeah, they'd be looking.  How stupid do people be?  But once again, yeah, once again, MTV was trying to do something. 
[00:45:30]  They got everyone talking.  But for the media to not even acknowledge that this could have been set up until today.  Yeah.  Now they're all in on it.  And finally, did anyone take a peek of that reality show, I'm a Celebrity, get me the fuck out of here, whatever the hell it's called?  Uh-uh.  Holy shit.  Right, right?  Holy mother of shit.  I'm so done with reality shows.  I saw five minutes. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Holy mother of shit.  Who's in it?  I saw, you know what made me turn it off because I felt sorry for the guy?  Lou Diamond Phillips.  Really?  As part of this reality show.  The star of every movie, original sci-fi channel movie.  But I'm like, this guy, how much does this guy have to suffer?  He lost his wife to another chick.  Yeah.  His career is in the gutter.  And now he's on this show.  I'm like, I can't, I can't watch this.  Who are the celebs? 
[00:46:30]  Let's see.  Let's see who the celebs are.  We got Lou Diamond Phillips.  You got Heidi Montag.  Who's that?  Press her button.  Does her picture come up on the bottom?  Yeah, it's that broad.  You'll know her.  Who's that picture?  She's from the Hills or one of those.  Oh.  The fucking Laguna Beach Hills thing.  Damn, dude.  She's hot.  Yeah.  What have we got here?  Janice Dickinson.  Oh, God.  Enough with her.  Who? 
[00:47:00]  Janice?  Who is she?  Janice Dickinson.  Janice.  I thought it was Janice.  No.  Janice.  Janice.  That's Janice Dickinson.  And then, whatever.  Hold on.  And Thani, who do you think that is?  A pie.  And Thani.  One of the first supermodels.  Janice.  One of the first supermodels.  Jimee, just stop.  Leave him alone.  Jimee.  Yep.  Oh, literal Jimee.  I'm teed.  I'm teed. 
[00:47:30]  Uncle Janice.  Uncle Payowl.  Running into the ground.  Of course.  I can't stand Janice Dickinson.  No, why?  She's one of these thinks she's hot, just a washed up whore.  Was hot.  Who's on all these stupid fucking shows.  And she knows how to work the shows.  Mm-hmm.  Because it's not reality.  It's total fake.  So she knows how to try to put drama in by getting in fights with people. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  The last thing I saw was one of those fucking, you know, load a house up with has-beens and  see what happens.  What was that one on VH1?  What?  Celebrity.  Oh, God.  The fucking.  Not Celebrity Rehab.  The other one?  Surreal Life?  Surreal Life.  That was it.  Yeah.  I saw a few episodes of that.  And that was like the last reality show I ever checked out.  And they got lazy with reality shows.  You know, like, Surreal Life is pretty much filmed over a weekend.  Really? 
[00:48:30]  I mean, maybe a little longer than that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like this three-month thing anymore.  Three months?  See, you forgot.  The first Real Worlds were six months.  Yeah.  The cameras were rolling for six months.  These guys were bored.  They were, like, hanging out in a basement of a house just filming for six months to get  good TV.  Then they knocked it down to three months.  You know that the new Real World is a month and a half?  Really?  Something like that?  It's barely a month?  And that's long for, uh...  Yeah.  Tori Wilson?  WWE.  WWE.  I remember her, of course. 
[00:49:00]  Uh, let's see Lou Diamond.  Where's his picture?  Lou Diamond Phillips.  La Bamba.  You might remember him, uh, from La Bamba.  Playing Richie Valens.  Was he in that?  Wasn't he in Stand and Deliver?  I don't know.  He was in Young Guns.  I know that.  And, um...  And now he's in Things That Suck.  Mm-hmm.  On Syfy.  They were trying to pick a leader last night, and it was... 
[00:49:30]  A leader.  And then they started talking about jungle slime, and I was...  I'm out of here.  Done.  I'm so done.  Who else is in this?  Uh, San...  Sanjay...  What the fuck is his name?  Sanjaya?  Yeah, from American Idol.  That, uh...  There you go.  Oh, God.  There you get Sanjaya.  Great.  We get Sanjaya.  How did they get this collection of fucking losers together?  Because no one else would do it.  They actually asked me to do that.  Is that Drew Boogie over there?  I don't mean Drew Boogie's a loser. 
[00:50:00]  I just mean it looks like Drew Boogie.  Yeah?  Who's that guy?  Joe...  Oh...  Joe Hinn?  Sally?  Joe Hinn.  John Sally rules.  Joe Hinn.  John Sally is a very entertaining guy.  He doesn't have to do that shit.  Can I say for the record, I don't like the fact that I said that they asked me to do it,  and nobody even questioned it or believed that I would be popular.  Or questions.  You're right.  No, you have to be a kind of a has-been or even a wannabe if you're doing that. 
[00:50:30]  Who's the other broad?  The one next to the blonde?  Yeah.  Who's she?  Someone else was pointing out bodyguards don't sit in the audience during the MTV award shows.  Oh.  Then who are the big thugs next to it?  Well, they had to have them there for the bit.  Of course.  You know?  What, you can't have your bodyguards sit there?  Guys like Eminem probably do.  And who's Patti? 
[00:51:00]  It's Pate.  Pate.  Blagojevich.  Blagojevich?  Oh, Blagojevich.  Oh, my God, yes.  Governor's wife.  What a disgrace.  They got the wife.  Know why?  Because the governor wanted to do it, and he wasn't allowed to.  Oh, right.  He wasn't allowed to.  So they got the wife instead.  Oh, I forgot about that.  That's what show this is?  Yeah.  Embarrassing.  Yeah, so they had to get the wife.  What fucking piece of shit channel is this on?  Who the fuck would want to see...  NBC?  ...the wife? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, good.  It's horrendous.  I'm a celebrity.  Get me out of here.  She's a celebrity?  For what?  For having sex with a guy that tried to sell...  Obama's sentence.  ...office, yeah.  That's all it takes to be famous, Steve.  Could they have a little dignity, though?  Could that family leave with an ounce of self-respect?  None left.  She's doing interracial porn.  They are in a dignity deficit.  Just horrible.  That joke was. 
[00:52:00]  Boo, boo, boo.  Oh, boo, boo, boo, boo.  I should be on the show now.  I'm a pair of ears.  Get me out of here.  You might have to watch the show.  Tori Wilson's nipples were so hard all night in every shot.  That's because she's got fucking implants.  Well, let's take a look at her nipples.  These girls that have these implants...  ...that's awesome.  I mean, a nipple shot from last night's show.  Oh, and of course, Stephen Baldwin, another fucking reality show whore. 
[00:52:30]  He's a lunatic.  Remember when he used to wander into our show?  Yeah, and just start rambling about things.  Oh, wow.  Wow, is he out of his mind.  He's like a crazy person.  Let's say hi to Stephen in Wyoming.  Steve.  Hey, what's up?  You know, my problem with this reality show is, like, you know, the first ones were all right,  but now they're still fucking fake, and people watch this shit.  If you just stop watching this whore shit on TV, and we all do it, you know, you watch 
[00:53:00]  them for five minutes, but if we stop watching this whore shit and giving them that little  bit of rating, they get rid of it.  We get some classic fucking good TV again.  Now, I don't know who's watching these.  Nope.  I don't get it.  Nope.  Nope.  No?  If you know what's going on, the sitcom and all those type of shows are going away,  my friend.  Too expensive to make.  So you're going to see more and more of these reality shows and these shows that are very  cheap to make.  In this day and age, though, maybe when the economy snaps back and people want to advertise  again, the networks can get more money and make better shows. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  Well, yeah.  I've lost.  There's too many Jerry Seinfelds out there nowadays, you know?  You can't pay them anymore.  There's no Jerry Seinfelds out there.  Name one Jerry Seinfeld that's out there.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Besides Jerry.  They all make too much.  You're just a one.  You brought up a good point.  The finance.  They all make too much.  Hold on, sir.  We couldn't hear you.  What's that?  I said, you make a good point.  The finance to all of it.  And they all make too much.  You know?  It costs way too much to pay anybody to work.  The wash-ups.  The wash-ups are even good. 
[00:54:00]  I'm bored.  I'm bored.  I'm bored with you.  Top 10 TV star salaries.  Zach Braff is...  Scrubs.  Zach.  Is he the one?  He makes 7.7 mil.  Per what?  Per year.  Annual pay.  Per year.  Okay.  His sister's a comic.  Charlie Sheen is...  What is he?  Number nine.  All right.  7.7 mil.  The cast of Desperate Housewives make 10 million. 
[00:54:30]  Yuck.  And they all got to make the same, I guess.  Kiefer.  Kiefer.  There he is with 13 million coming in at number seven.  Katie Couric.  15 million.  A waste of their money.  To be in last place.  James Gandolfini.  22 million.  What's he doing, though?  He's not even on...  Probably residuals.  He might have signed a good deal.  That thing's on A&E now.  You can watch him go,  I don't need this friggin' problems.  Friggin'.  You notice that?  You watched it?  I watched it for a couple minutes, too. 
[00:55:00]  Like, what are they doing?  It's my friggin' house.  Yeah.  You friggin' frig frig.  Right.  You missed Simon Cowell.  How much does he make?  Simon.  Simon is 30...  What?  36 million.  36 mil.  Oof.  And then I saw Letterman comes up next at number three.  Making 40 mil.  Nice.  He makes 40 million a year?  Yeah.  Nice.  Wow.  That's a hell of a paycheck.  Number two on the list is Dr. Fucking Phil. 
[00:55:30]  Is number two...  Well, then we know who number one's gotta be, right?  It's gotta be the Ofra.  The Ofra.  Ofra.  And what a severe fucking drop-off from number one.  What's Dr. Phil?  Let me look at Dr. Phil again.  Dr. Phil is number two with 45 million.  And then we go to number one at 225 million.  We have Oprah Winfrey.  I was reading an article on her just yesterday, and I gotta remember, and it wasn't a placement. 
[00:56:00]  They're calling her an oil salesman.  All the stuff she's...  Oh, snake oil salesman?  Snake oil salesman.  Yeah, that's shit.  For all the stuff she's pushing.  And then they listed all the stuff she's pushed recently on our show.  It's hilarious.  I forgot where it was.  Because I'll do a little searching during the break.  She's directly responsible for Dr. Phil.  Yeah.  For Dr. Phil's entire huge career.  He's now number two.  She probably gets a taste of his money.  Oh, I'm sure that she's an executive producer or something for the show.  Mm-hmm.  She wouldn't just let the guy fucking run off and... 
[00:56:30]  That Ofra.  That Ofra.  Snake oil salesman.  I'm gonna get the list of things she's pushed on her show recently.  There is just...  Ah, man.  That's a lot of fucking money to make.  Mm-hmm.  Well.  What are you gonna...  There goes snake oil.  Oh, you got it?  All right.  All right.  The queen of...  Maybe.  Yeah, books.  I mean, any product. 
[00:57:00]  These fucking dumb puppet bitches.  They just latch on to whatever she says.  If Oprah liked it, it's on Oprah's show.  Ooh.  Oprah pushes snake oil.  There's a few snake oil Oprah analogies being made.  Yeah, the one I read yesterday.  That might be...  Yeah, it might have been on Dig, actually.  Dig.  Everything seems to be going to this Newsweek.  Don't you dig?  It might be...  I think I got the link through dig.com. 
[00:57:30]  But it just listed...  The list was really funny.  Yeah.  Half the stuff is just shit.  She's pushing down housewives' throats.  Just shit.  And they run for it, man.  Yeah.  Why don't we...  We'll try to find that as we take our first break.  Just getting started.  Yes, we will.  We're gonna take a peek at Conan's first night.  See how he did.  Oh, that was his first night was last night.  And then David Letterman having fun with the fact that Jay is no longer around.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  So we'll do a little something-something after the break. 
[00:58:00]  Was he turning the screws on him a little bit?  A little bit.  Yeah.  You mean the guy that beat him consistently?  A little bit.  Ouch.  We'll get into it next.  Okay, Anthony.  Stay there.  The greatest cereal ever right here. 
[00:58:30]  Kashi?  I know Kashi again, but...  It is good.  Cinnamon Harvest is good, man.  Holy shit, this is good.  I just want to make it sound like Cinnamon Harvest.  The names of Kashi cereals make me not want to eat it, because it just sounds...  You want to try it?  ...like nature, man.  When you try to eat sort of healthy, this is...  This is...  This is...  This is it right here.  I don't like that.  I just don't like the names.  Try some.  No.  Cinnamon Harvest.  Kashi. 
[00:59:00]  That's it.  Almost as good as Popeye's.  Wow.  Wow.  Popeye's.  A little better for you.  Damn it.  Why am I thinking of Popeye's?  Ugh.  Opie and Anthony.  Cinnamon Harvest.  You can't harvest cinnamon.  Remember the really...  Buss of dust.  Remember the really...  Remember the really gay one I was eating?  Oh, God.  Lean on me.  Stephen and Steve.  Those capri pants.  My God.  Lean on me.  That was it.  With the woman on the front, standing on her tippy toes. 
[00:59:30]  And her yoga uniform.  Yeah.  Oh, when you poured the cereal out of there, we just...  Everybody just looked at you.  You know what?  I'll give someone a hundred bucks if they could eat a bowl of that without having massive problems.  Really?  Gastric problems.  Pains.  Farts.  Bloating.  The fuck is in that cereal?  Sounds like the Mets, apparently.  What happened?  The Mets.  I didn't know...  All the Mets got, like, fucking diarrhea.  They got explosive diarrhea. 
[01:00:00]  They all have the stomach flu, they're calling it.  Uh-oh.  The stomach flu, and they're passing it around the locker room.  I did not know that, Ant.  So, yeah, a few of the Mets are kind of...  Blasting.  Poor guys.  And what?  Our own E-Rock has pneumonia?  Yeah, a little pneumonia.  Pneumonia.  For the E to the rock.  Fatty pneumonia.  But he has no problem playing Punch-Out.  Oh, really? 
[01:00:30]  Enough of his stupid Punch-Out Twitters.  Shut the fuck up.  What's a Punch-Out Twitter?  Is he Twittering?  It's so funny that you said that, because I was just having this very same conversation  in the office with Sam and Travis.  Yeah.  Is he Twitter...  What's he Twitter...  You know something?  I don't even follow the E-Rock.  Why would you?  I guess I should.  He talks about Punch-Out.  What is that, a video game?  Yeah.  I guess.  It's for the Wii.  He only plays Wii.  Isn't it an old video game?  Yeah, but they updated it.  Yeah, they redid for the Wii.  Yeah, they've done it a few times.  They put out a Punch-Out for Super Nintendo, and now they're doing it again with Wii. 
[01:01:00]  Punch-Out?  Punch-Out.  That was like an old Mike Tyson boxing game, right?  Well, originally it was Punch-Out in the arcades, and then once it went to the NES, they got  Mike Tyson involved.  It was Mike Tyson's Punch-Out.  That's when I remember it.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Now I know that game.  What is he...  So he's Twittering that he's still playing it in classic mode.  And not only that, but he's been posting pictures of screenshots.  What a fucking bore.  Is he really? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, look.  That's his Twitter.  Who wants to read that shit?  It's a screen cap of Punch-Out.  Of course.  Look, the big cartoon things.  Fucking...  That Wii stinks.  Can you imagine if every time I beat a level in a video game, I took a picture of the screen  and posted it to my screen?  We should all start doing that.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to start doing.  When is Tiger Woods coming out?  I can't wait any longer.  They said June.  Next Monday.  They've actually pushed the Tiger Woods video game.  It's back to August.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  That's right.  It's August.  What?  Oh, thank God. 
[01:02:00]  I can read your eyes.  Thank God.  Jimmy.  Thank God.  I wasn't looking at Jimmy because I knew he was lying.  But pick up...  I wanted to...  We're talking Monday?  Yeah.  Is it a week?  Less than a week?  Yeah.  Six days.  Oh, wow.  Am I happy.  Nice.  All right.  Letterman.  Conan.  Thriller in Manila.  Yeah.  Thriller in Manila.  Joe Frazier coming in.  We'll get to that in a second.  How about...  What do you want to do?  Letterman or Conan? 
[01:02:30]  Just a little taste.  Well, I think it's a big day for the late night shows.  Right.  All right.  Conan's first day.  Conan first.  Jimmy, are you going to be invited on Conan?  I don't know.  I mean...  Oh, that's right.  I would, you know, be nice to be invited.  Sure.  But they never even acknowledged you were alive, which is so stupid.  They did not, no.  But I don't think that comes from Conan.  Sometimes, you know, everyone has a staff, and I don't know if his staff liked me or not.  They may have, and just because I didn't pursue what they did, I don't know. 
[01:03:00]  I got a really dumb question.  Sure.  Did Conan ever have edgy comedians on a show?  Yeah, he did.  Or were they more like political?  No.  Well, I...  Janine Garofalo's...  Yeah, well, he's had Janine, but he's had Mark Maron a lot.  Louis C.K.  Yeah, Mark on.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Now, Conan's had a lot of really good comics on him.  He's had Louis on?  Oh, many times.  I think Louis wrote for him, and I'm pretty sure Louis knows him well.  He's known him many times.  So how does Louis put the word in for Jimmy?  I never asked Louis to.  Maybe he would.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:03:30]  Fuck Louis.  Conan's first night.  Oh, fuck Louis right in his ear.  A little taste.  Quick hand, ladies and gentlemen, my old pal Andy Richter right there.  Yeah, brought back Andy.  Yeah.  You know why, though?  Why?  Well, Andy hasn't been doing much.  Kind of felt miserably without Conan.  What was he doing, Andy?  I don't know if this.  I don't know if much.  I don't know if I'm right there.  They were really good together, and then Conan...  Andy went out and acted in a few...  Bombs. 
[01:04:00]  Bombs, yeah.  I think he had a TV series or two he attempted, and...  Yeah.  They gave him a pan out.  So he's going to be like Ed McMahon?  They gave him plenty of shots, and now they're back together.  Co-host kind of a thing?  Like Ed McMahon?  No.  Is he going for that?  Probably the same role he had.  Which was Ed McMahon.  Just kind of...  Yeah.  I guess.  No, didn't he sit on the couch, though?  Yeah, so did Ed.  Ed did sit there the whole time.  Ed McMahon was like the guy that sat there with Johnny the whole time.  All right.  Hold on a minute. 
[01:04:30]  Like, Jay never had that.  Jay never had like a...  You're right.  He did not.  He kind of...  He had the rapport with...  What's his name?  His band leader there?  Kevin Eubanks.  Kevin Eubanks.  I'm considering John would announce it.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to challenge you on that a little bit.  I know you're...  I'll get my ass kicked every time talking TV with you.  Oh, it's okay, sir.  But I will ask you this.  Mm-hmm.  Didn't Carson start being solo dude, and then later, Ed McMahon started doing the couch?  Boy, I don't know.  I think Ed always did the couch. 
[01:05:00]  They would...  I know he almost moved off screen as the guest...  Well, yeah, because he'd get pushed way over, but...  Kept getting pushed over to the left.  Ed would announce Johnny.  Johnny would do the monologue, and then they would come back to the desk, and Ed would be  sitting there, and he'd have a little chit-chat with Ed, maybe do a few of his little  things, and Ed would go, oh, oh, oh, you know, a few, you know, little news things.  They'd do skits with the mighty Carson art players.  I'm just saying, I thought for some reason that maybe Johnny started solo on the couch, 
[01:05:30]  Ed McMahon was always there.  That's a good question, but I assume...  Well, to tell you the truth, in a home movie I have that goes back to the mid-60s, early  60s, early to mid-60s, somebody passed by a television.  And Johnny Carson was there.  Wow.  And Ed McMahon is sitting right there at the chair next to him.  Okay.  Very young, like...  It's so weird to pass by that and see that.  It's in black and white.  That's what they were watching.  Because the TV was black and white.  And that's what they were watching, yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Old family members in the video?  Oh, yeah, dead.  How great is that?  So dead.  Not that they're dead, but...  Wow.  Well, yeah.  My dad had something from the 50s, and it was like a great-grandfather, and all these  people that sort of looked like me, older version.  I mean, and I started doing the math.  I'm like, that guy that I'm looking at in this video that is associated with me through  blood was born in the 1800s.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[01:06:30]  Oof.  Because he was an old guy.  Yeah.  And it was the 50s, so, you know, do the math.  1880, easy.  Oh, man.  And then other people in that same video that are my aunts and uncles to this day, obviously.  So they're still alive.  They're in a video with a guy that was easily born in the 1800s.  Just like that.  Wow.  That is something.  And we would like to think that the 1800s were so long ago.  Yeah.  But it's just a generation or two removed. 
[01:07:00]  That's all.  You get an old fucking videotape of Christmas from the 50s or 60s in your family, you're  going to see some old relatives that were born in the 1800s.  That's fucked up.  That is fucked up.  Because that's like a long time ago.  That's Old West shit.  That's what I like to think.  Yeah.  Could have been a Civil War guy there.  Yeah.  Civil War?  Yeah, sure.  Civil War, sure.  Here's Conan's first  night. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, come on.  Max Weinberg.  Thanks, O'Brien.  It's like a Backstreet Boys reunion here.  Only not as good.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I have to admit, I think I've timed this moment perfectly. 
[01:08:00]  Think about it.  I'm on a last place network.  I moved to a state that's bankrupt, and tonight's show is sponsored by General Motors.  We got all three.  You think Conan's going to go a little more mainstream now that he's got the big gig?  Good question.  Because he was a bit quirky with his stuff.  Very quirky.  I mean, he worked on current events and what's not.  But, you know, Jay was all about right, mainstream, bam. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  He's not one of those guys that are like Jay, where he appeals to the masses.  He's kind of niche-y.  I like Conan.  I think he's funny, but I think he will have to change his act.  What is he doing?  Well, Jay's a stand-up, too.  It's like to watch a monologue that's topical five nights a week, you want a guy who's going  to, you know...  I mean, Conan's been doing monologues for years, but...  Yeah.  Yeah, but they're different monologues there. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, I'm wondering what he's going to do with his bits mostly.  Like Conan does these things during his monologue that are very quirky.  And, you know, kind of almost inside jokes to people that have been watching for a while.  I don't know how that'll go over with mainstream America mom and pop sitting there in bed waiting  to just doze off, you know?  It's one of those weird...  Man, we'll see.  More of Conan on his first night.  We're just going to play the whole show here. 
[01:09:30]  It'll kill an hour.  The whole show.  Commercials and everything.  Can you imagine?  How long would it take for the listeners to go, oh my God, I think they're playing the  whole show.  I think they're...  Oh, are they?  They can't be...  No.  No, no.  No.  We should do that one day.  A lot of people, a lot of people have been asking me, will your show, will your show be  any different?  Oh, there you go.  That's exactly what we were just asking.  And I told them, no.  My program will not change, because I'm going to do that one thing. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Yes.  My name is now Conando.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  if i could grow a mustache all right you know uh ladies this is a huge night for me i remember  watching johnny carson when i was a kid and thinking that's what i want to be when i grow up 
[01:10:30]  and i'm sure right now somewhere in america there's a little kid watching me thinking what  is wrong with that man's hair is is that even a man why is she crying  that hair is fucked up he really was blessed with some uh with some cowlick the old cowlick  it sounds like he's uh you know kind of not that nervous it's just a different studio yeah but it's 
[01:11:00]  the tonight show dude that's different you know yeah yeah looks uh sounds very comfortable a lot  of people uh have been wishing me well today which is very nice and getting i'm getting calls from  you know relatives and friends but i understand this is big we just received a quick hello from  secretary of state hillary clinton for our big first show this is the secretary of state this is huge  very exciting the secretary of state hillary clinton hello that was the secretary of state 
[01:11:30]  hillary clinton  right a little sound gag yeah i'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt here  it's a little taste of his first night and then uh on the other network  because we can't figure it out at home the other network which one are they talking about 
[01:12:00]  you had uh david letterman hi and welcome to the late show  i'm dave letterman i'm still here i knocked off another competitor  thank you 
[01:12:30]  well i uh my day got off to kind of a weird start i get a call uh from mom and uh mom says  well david i see you didn't get the tonight show again  ouch oh  and i said uh uh uh uh mom uh honest to god i said it's a pretty good show and she says  who's on the show 
[01:13:00]  i said well bill cosby is here  wow they really want to compete  and then  and then mom said okay maybe i'll switch from conan  thanks a lot ma  there you go a little taste of what happened last night  is this kevin smith he would call the hotline though kevin 
[01:13:30]  hey what's up  hey  kevin smith everyone  hi  um it is day two for me  fellas i i didn't get  wait it is kevin smith  we actually didn't believe it was you kevin until uh you just said that  yeah it didn't sound like you  no because you're  i was about to scream baba booey and hang up  holy crap  call from the set  uh not quite yet i'm driving to the set today there is no set it's just uh driving  shots so it's like you put the car on a process trailer 
[01:14:00]  right and then drag it and drive a driver so we're shooting on the bqe at one point which is  presents its own challenges  um that's in about an hour and then uh we take it to like some streets in queens or brooklyn i forget  wait wait you don't have to shut the road down for that right you just kind of i mean i i mean you know  ideally you would but you can't shut anything down in new york dude i mean no i'm like the bqe you know  people would be pissed off so can't somebody ruin the shot by like you know going up and going  beep beep you know i mean you know you certainly don't want people riding behind you beeping their 
[01:14:30]  horns but at the same time generally the backgrounds are kind of mushy you keep everything in focus  and then the backgrounds go mushy and so you're okay do you like doing days like this or do you  get bored would you rather do a set day or just kind of like a day off process trailer days are  horrible because you got to cram about six eight people onto the back of a pickup to truck essentially  what's dancing out to a pickup truck and you're just riding out in the open so it's like you know 
[01:15:00]  they always tell you you can't ride in the truck in a truck man will give you a ticket you have cops  following you and in front of you and you actually drive on the back of this truck the wind blowing  all the time and it's the worst way to direct an actor or two actors because they're in a car behind  you you can't get to them you have a walkie-talkie to communicate with them so there's always a delay  between what you're saying and uh what they're hearing it's uh it's you know look it beats you  know laying brick are really working for a week but in terms of this job it's as irritating as it  gets but the good news is good news is the two dudes in the car willis and morgan are hysterical 
[01:15:30]  we shot all day with them yesterday at this diner in ridgewood and it was uh we're satellite right  yeah yeah fucking amazing it was so fucking amazing the the chemistry between the two is just great  man it's it i think it's gonna be a really funny fucking movie oh that's great man that's great to  hear um but what i'm doing is i pull up that man when uh do a few but i'll try to call back  i'll let you guys know what's going on i'll try to call you from the process show it's just gonna sound 
[01:16:00]  like yeah i'll give it a shot regardless i neglected neglected to call you and felt i was just so  terrified i didn't have time to think about anything else actually shooting the scene but  now i feel a little safer we got one day under the belt everyone gets along well so so i got enough  time to call in but i'm gonna call in about an hour if that's cool to you guys yeah of course man  all right fellas see you always welcome i'll talk to you all right all right buddy kevin smith the man  of his word he said he would call from the set of his new movie and there he is and he did man how 
[01:16:30]  many people can be pissed on the b the bqe today now they find out it's bruce willis and tracy  they're like that's a fucking movie you know it's true yeah it's bruce willis and good chemistry  between those two yeah driving around in uh one of those trailer things they put a car in a trailer  and just drive it around with cameras it's so odd i didn't understand that until i was a lot older  yeah it's like how could they drive i couldn't figure that one out i don't get it then i finally 
[01:17:00]  saw one of those making of yeah oh that's how they do it but they put the truck in a flatbed  and acting same time such an idiot there are some uh shots you see like uh seinfeld used a couple of  techniques during the daytime they would just run you know whatever it was behind them they're driving  through manhattan and you'd have like the manhattan scene behind you then there were some scenes where  uh uh there would just be kind of lights like at night there'd be headlights behind them very fuzzy 
[01:17:30]  and then they'd like sweep lights in front of their face like if you're driving at night so you  wouldn't even have to put run any video or anything behind you and there was another one with just the  blurry kind of fuzzy background yeah that you want if somebody's behind the vehicle going i think that  was all waving into the camera i always thought that that was like green screen yeah the seinfeld  driving shots oh yeah it is it is yeah they didn't drive around new york no they're you could tell 
[01:18:00]  like sometimes they screw up when they go to turn the wheel and realize like you're not turning  in time or you're turning too late right looks silly very good speaking of movies what the hell  let's uh say into thriller in manila 1975 right jimmy yes jimmy's a huge uh old school fight fan yes i am  i'm a huge old school fight fan old school old school fight it was everything these fights were  everything yeah it was a big the big get they didn't happen a lot right and uh when they did 
[01:18:30]  everyone got got excited about it watched it when was the last big fight that everyone got excited  about for real like where the whole one of the tyson fights really gotta go tyson maybe a de la  hoya fight when de la hoya was undefeated might not have been a heavyweight not one of those things  where everyone was like dude you're getting the pay-per-view right i think you gotta go over 
[01:19:00]  the house i think you gotta go heavyweight fight to begin with yeah no offense to uh de la hoya gotta  go heavyweight holyfield getting his ear bit off that's probably yeah could be that could that be  the last fight that everyone really went because then mike wasn't able to box for how long after that  oh wow they took his license and everything so there wasn't really any more excitement left in  boxing then when he came back it was kind of big but and boxing was already starting to fade away  yeah as far as the popularity goes yep because i mean you could go back to i hate to say it last 
[01:19:30]  real big fight could have been uh spinks and and tyson michael spinks and tyson um yeah oh god damn  holy shit that clip still gets me he bit his ear off oh tyson was pissed and then he walks back and  punches him but i think tyson telling the ref he bit my fucking ear off somebody help me out with  this one tyson uh swears that he did this because he was so pissed off because what was holyfield doing 
[01:20:00]  holding him or or or uh too many low blows like it's just insane to look at the chunk he took out  his fucking ear oh i know what it was he was rabbit punching him holyfield was punching him uh behind  his uh neck and then yeah and the ref was doing nothing about it so tyson was getting more and more  pissed off and he nibbled on his ear a couple times like don't you fucking do that again and then uh  holyfield did it again and then tyson said all right well look what i do now when you see him 
[01:20:30]  rip his head he moves his head in a way where he is look at this look oh and you see that that  like resistance resistance and then it tear and it lets go it's not there's not many that's crazy  there's not many nerve endings in the year oh god damn but help me out that is something a crazy person  does you know what chewing on it right there holy and then he goes after him you know what i saw the  tyson movie that just came out less than uh a few months ago a few months ago and tyson explained his 
[01:21:00]  his reasoning and it made a lot of sense made a lot of there's no reason fight fans you gotta be a  professional in that ring and to bite the guy was a dirty fucking fighter and tyson started getting  pissed off you go to the ref and go well look at this guy look what he's doing the ref was ignoring  it you can't bite the guy's ear off you fight you never bite the ear of the opponent oh but tyson was  basically saying holyfield was fighting dirty and this is what i'm gonna do then yeah someone help 
[01:21:30]  me out with uh exactly what that was oh okay thank you uh ron of georgia he was headbutting okay yeah  it was headbutting i'm sorry so holyfield was headbutting uh tyson every chance he could get  and tyson kept looking even at the ref right uh ron like what the fuck are you gonna stop this headbutting  and they went back to fighting and and and didn't he headbutt him in a in a prior fight too  the first fight he never fought prior he buckled him with a headbutt yeah yeah he buckled uh tyson with 
[01:22:00]  a headbutt and and holyfield would lead with his head and and and make sure he headbutted uh tyson  because he couldn't get to him see he he he said that he did he wasn't good he knew he wasn't hit but  he felt like he was hit and he didn't know why he felt that way right and when they went back and  looked at the tape holyfield was coming in headfirst and he hit him two or three times and there was  one time that you could tell tyson was just dazed yeah yeah because uh holyfield had was known for 
[01:22:30]  kind of leading with his head and headbutting on his head but how did tyson explain this whole thing  in that horrendous movie not because tyson was bad tyson was amazing but uh tollback just filmed a  horrible movie a horrible director horrible and i'll tell you what i mean after seeing this  thriller in manila it makes the tyson movie looks horribly directed horribly yes but uh thank you  ron a lot of people a lot of people said tyson was frustrated with holyfield's boxing style 
[01:23:00]  that holyfield was a guy who beat tyson in the amateur ranks i think and i think that uh  he had a style that frustrated tyson and tyson was just getting frustrated  no but tyson just says look it's all about the headbutting this guy was doing and i he just  finally had it and obviously lost his mind and you're right yeah it's it's a mind of a crazy person  but yep you know tyson said you know what fuck you i'm biting your ear off now motherfucker um  someone else saying that it was the uh oscar de la hoya fight yeah with de la hoya who though 
[01:23:30]  i don't know jimmy mayweather see that's just it i don't know i'm i i i i barely paid attention to  it isn't to to the fights that weren't you know heavyweight fights it's not that fight it's not  it's not that fight oh you would remember we're talking about the memorable it's back to tyson  that's the last ones where people were just everywhere you had to see it you went over  friend's house for pay-per-view and shit like that you knew it was going to last a minute if you were 
[01:24:00]  lucky right and uh you but you had to see it well the um thriller in manila dvd that we were handed  yesterday we got joe frazier coming in in about 45 minutes smoke this fucking movie was great it  tells joe frazier's side of the whole thrill in manila yep yeah and uh you know you got you got  to understand that it's his side of it yeah but he makes some pretty solid points in this uh in this  documentary right jimmy yeah it's it's there's um certain things are obviously just frazier's opinion 
[01:24:30]  because he hates all these guts but there's other things that are indisputable which like the news  footage you show where uh you know ollie was a funny guy and he was a great fight promoter he  knew how to get you interested but you know he was the thriller in manila i'm gonna beat that gorilla  and he would he would take a little rubber gorilla and he just started punching it in the face rapidly  yeah um as frazier and he also called him an uncle tom which is the worst thing you could call  one black man could call another black man yeah he was really he taunted frazier in a way that went 
[01:25:00]  like because they were friends and frazier really helped him a lot yeah slow down there for a second  because they they they get into that with the film now when ali uh was banned because of his uh his  stance on vietnam and and didn't want to fight he lost his boxing license for how long three years  three years right and he he was out of the public eye he was he was he was close to broke and in this  uh film there's a there's a great scene where butch lewis who worked for frazier's camp  was in a limo with frazier and ali as frazier handed ali money yeah that's how bad it got for ali like 
[01:25:30]  here here's some money to get you by until you know you figure out what's going to happen with  your boxing career and they truly were friends and then when they reinstated ali also an ali  according to frazier completely turned on him and and ali explained years later you know he was saying  all the all that ugly shit because you know he was trying to promote a fight i just realized  that that fucking ear thing was 1997 that's a wow dude 12 12 years ago i remember i was in the 
[01:26:00]  car when i heard that i would have said that was probably three months god i just got my license  maybe longer and mills lane who was the referee yeah said something about uh mike's like mike said i  didn't bite it like bullshit you didn't know yes you did yes you did brad yes you did i think he  said something like that it was right when mills goes over to get points deducted or whatever  it's in the corner it happens you can hear mills lane saying something i don't know if we have it on 
[01:26:30]  you'd be able to hear it on this yeah um so yeah i just want to slow you down just to get that out  and then ali turned on frazier completely when he got back into the fight game and he made it  so if you were a black guy you rooted for ali and if you were white you rooted for joe frazier  which is completely amazing if you know anything about frazier's upbringing completely amazing and  this documentary gets into it a little bit the guy lives in one of the worst neighborhoods of philly 
[01:27:00]  he basically lives in the ghetto to this day he's a man of the of his people he lives in in one room  above his boxing gym really as ali is making millions and millions to this day he's pretty  much doesn't have a lot of money yeah i think he's hit uh hard times financially it doesn't usually  happen a boxer's amazing well not usually you wouldn't think of a guy like frazier i mean like 
[01:27:30]  you know lower level guys but a guy is iconic in frazier i think every heavyweight is broke except  for muhammad ali and george foreman yeah and it's from what they did after boxing uh before we  continue talking about thrill in manila here we go chris in jersey tell me if you guys want to talk  to any of these guys de la hoya versus trinidad was last super bout that was a big one um yeah that  was a big one uh a couple people saying that lewis tyson was last big fight yeah lennox lewis tyson was 
[01:28:00]  huge uh larry holmes versus cooney was last huge fight looney cooney remember they call him looney cooney  uh is frazier even going to be here because he had a family member murdered in philly over the  weekend no did he really yeah grandson or something oh wow it's a step grandson but i mean i'm sure  there's still uh you know emotions there oh wow uh holyfield versus lewis at the garden was last huge  fight nah holyfield lewis was big i'm sure but not like when you think of frazier ali that was a world 
[01:28:30]  event yep everybody on the fucking planet wanted to see that they all wanted to see frazier foreman  they all wanted to see ali foreman they all wanted to see ken norton i mean they all wanted to see these  guys fight that's what i was telling my girl last night i'm like man i mean 20 30 years ago when there  was a fight or any kind of pop culture event the world watched yeah but then again there's so much  there's so many tv stations the internet other things the twitters the facebooks and all that 
[01:29:00]  that you can't get the whole world or let's say the whole country involved in one event anymore  it used to be wide world of sports like you would turn that on and that was like your  your big sports show yeah that was it now you see sports anyway you go to espn they got 20 channels  you go on the internet you can't just get that big audience anymore for one thing you could get it  you could get it as time goes by because people go you know what i'm gonna go to youtube yeah and  check out what i missed this weekend or whatever so you do eventually get a lot of people on different 
[01:29:30]  mediums yeah people watch it too right but back then it was close circuit they they had him they had  him in movie theaters you would go to like the nassau coliseum you would go to the nassau coliseum and  they would have tv screens up and you would sit there with people watching a big bad big tv screen  it wasn't even clear no well they fought at 10 in the morning in manila for the american tv audience  like when ali fought for them it was four in the morning they would fight at these weird times 
[01:30:00]  whatever would give the american tv audience the biggest buying right uh chance it was 10 in the  morning in the fucking philippines when they went in and slugged it out to fill it and i wonder how long  it took to get your schedules adapted really wake up get my ass kicked today so the documentary uh  thrill in manila so yeah so frazier was uh known as like you know he fought for for the white people  out there wasn't he a deep south guy though he was from south carolina he was he was he was raised 
[01:30:30]  pretty much in south carolina which he said was you know one of the worst states to live in if you  were black worse than georgia alabama he said south carolina was matter of fact they in the  documentary they go back to his hometown or this one guy said uh i went back to his hometown after he  was the heavyweight champion of the world and he went to visit family and friends i think his mom  still lived there and she was smoking a corncob pipe on the front porch and he's the heavyweight 
[01:31:00]  champion of the world and he has a check he goes to the local bank and they wouldn't check they  wouldn't cast a check and he was the heavyweight champion of the world and they wouldn't catch  uh they wouldn't do you have identification do you have an account with us pull the hold of his fist  yeah it's my id uh wow i i don't know i look at i look at ali's i don't know a little differently  because this documentary i know it's frazier's take on things but it's still accurate i mean there's  still you still know that there's certain things he could not have spun a certain way you know ali had 
[01:31:30]  his charisma and he just ate frazier alive you know leading up to these fights because frazier  couldn't hang with him on that level whatsoever and this is uh something ali did during one of the  press conferences just it's a quick clip from thriller in manila frazier coming in to promote  this today now you're fighting a spiritual holy war when you face me now but when you're fighting  joe frazier is that a spiritual yes sir why because he's the uncle tom oh he's not he's not why 
[01:32:00]  did he insist on calling me cassius clay when even the worst of the white enemies recognize  muhammad ali he's the other type negro he's not like me you have two type slaves joe frazier's worse  than you to me that's what i mean when i say uncle tom see he's a brother one day he might be like me  but as of now he works for the enemy works for whitey the enemy yeah he really did not like  was uh was a racist he certainly was a racist when when we were all sitting there like oh my god ali 
[01:32:30]  love this guy look at him with howard cosell and when he said frazier is worse than you he was uh  the white reporter yes yes yes joe frazier had this fucking odd boxing style where he would just duck  he would literally go down to waist level oh look at that and come up and come up frazier was a really  hard guy to hit man he would just uh he would duck down to your waist and then roll back up and he  was a really fucking tough guy to hit did you um see in the documentary where they talked to some of 
[01:33:00]  these uh older muslim leaders and they claim that uh they fed ali a lot of a lot of that brilliant stuff  that he uh used in the media yes something muhammad i think i forget the guy's name was he said he gave  ali the quote uh what quote was it again no why would i go to vietnam vietnam no vietnam ever called me  nigger and that was ali's famous quote about why he wouldn't fight right it was a great quote why  i have no quarrel and this guy swears that ali had to face the media and didn't know what to say and  the guy told him what to say ali said it and it became his uh battle cry basically for what he 
[01:33:30]  believed in yeah but ali was uh i mean look he was uh he was with the nation of islam he would always  have that uh foi the fruit of islam which is like their security hat on he was hardcore fucking uh nation  of islam he had an fyi i always thought that was foi fyi for your information  but watching these guys go at it man frazier was so he literally watch how he ducks down we're  watching like clips of the thriller manila i think it really is and joe ducks down his hands are always 
[01:34:00]  like in front of his face and he ducks down to ali's waist and then rolls back up and throws  awkward punches so dangerous though you'd like to have your face down there where you could get an  uppercut like ali could just bam like bash him right in the head joe had a left hook that could  knock the fucking top three floors off a building that frazier's left hook was supposedly one of the  most devastating punches ever he wasn't known for his right was he wasn't a no his left hook right  you're right he wasn't a southpaw though was he i don't know we could ask him i just don't know 
[01:34:30]  because uh in the documentary they talk about how he wasn't known for his way uh uh his right  ali calls frazier a gorilla they told me i was gonna find a manila so i wrote a poem it'll be a  thriller and a killer and a chiller when i get that gorilla in manila and then he whipped out a  little rubber gorilla which was he said the soul of joe frazier come on gorilla we in manila  i have a secret place i'll go to get ready for joe frazier every day i go to the zoo 
[01:35:00]  holy shit killed him what a prick he would i tell you and then he crashed joe's training camp one  time and started taunting him from like the rafters of his own training uh camp like clever lang  and then there's an incident they talk about in the film that the media never picked up on  uh frazier's in his hotel in manila and uh ali shows up outside the hotel with a gun and starts  pointing it up at uh frazier after he called him to the balcony yeah and so didn't he start firing 
[01:35:30]  the gun up in the air not at him obviously but he started firing the gun how do you do that everyone  swears this happened and they said what's weird is when they were in manila wherever they went they  had media but at this at this particular uh point or incident they they didn't have media around  because i guess it was the middle of the night or something and people like he fucking came to  the hotel with a gun uh which he later said was a fake gun huh that was firing blanks i guess oh  okay yeah i'm just looking at joe fravers frazier's bloodied face yeah amazing these guys well like 
[01:36:00]  they used to just 15 rounds to piss out of each other didn't make it to 15 what's that didn't make  well that was the 14th round but i mean they were 15 round fights back then now they're 12 those guys  fought 44 rounds this is the fight where this is the fight where they both went into their uh corners  yeah after the 14th round they are all both guys were completely fucked up what we also learn in  this uh documentary some people knew this but i i did not i gotta be honest with you frazier was 
[01:36:30]  pretty much blind in his left eye for his whole career he had a training accident and he could just  what did what do they say he had very very he had a limited vision in his left eye which he completely  kept a secret nobody knew that except for him and his it was kind of foggy wow he could look out of  his left eye but it was very foggy and very yeah he had a training accident and what happened with  this thrill in manila fucking ali was able to close his right eye so they were saying so he's pretty  much blind they were saying he went into i think the 14th round pretty much blind and having to try 
[01:37:00]  to figure out how to to stay away from uh you know ali punched him in the right side yeah wow yeah and  so then they the 14th round ends ali it's now said was telling uh dundee his his guy yep to to cut my  gloves off he was done he didn't want to come out for the 15th round he was done he said cut him off  cut him off cut him off and uh there's uh a few people that swear they were sitting ringside and heard 
[01:37:30]  that well unfortunately frazier's uh corner did not hear that at the time yeah yeah because frazier was so  fucked up too and uh frazier's guy stopped the fight they never came out for the 15th but frazier's  got frazier wanted to fight frazier said he was furious he wanted to go out he's like don't you  stop this fucking fight do not stop this fucking fight you could see it they were reading his lips  in this documentary he's like don't stop and he looked pretty much like rocky did where his face 
[01:38:00]  was just a mess and the guy's eye pretty much closed that was confirmed because the guy i think his  name was something hauser he was ali's biographer he was in uh yes wing hauser he called he grabbed  ali and he said i'm ramrod and he beat him there was uh the guy who was in when we were kings he had  said ali confirmed it to him he not only had it confirmed but ali did say yeah i told dundee to cut  the clothes off motherfucker joe frazier's walking down the hall is this perfect timing or what oh man  is this perfect timing or i'm getting fucking chills it'd be funny if he walked in and just 
[01:38:30]  knocked you out and left i don't give a shit he can knock me out i'll take a fucking left hook from  him he's 60 something years old 63 63 where's the little cowboy hat oh my god it's perfect timing  i i thought we would do a little more radio before joe came in here oh how i want him but but uh but  really fast it's gonna take him a couple more minutes he's uh not really he's he's moving pretty  good uh so he so so frazier's corner stops the fight ali passes out in the ring ali couldn't 
[01:39:00]  collapsed in the ring collapsed he couldn't make it into the into the 15th round that's like movie  shit right there bring joe in here he comes joe frazier hello joe what's up joe how you doing there  joe how you guys doing how are you good man oh man wow thank you for coming fast cars and pretty  women beats you up all the time we were just talking about your uh the thriller in manila we 
[01:39:30]  didn't know you were coming to show yeah we got a copy of it we watched it last night and uh we  we've been talking about it for the last half hour it's an amazing amazing film yeah guys did a  good job on it man it's amazing how many i didn't know that there was so much real  animosity between you guys and when you watch this you you get a really ugly view of muhammad ali  you showed a really ugly side of ali that uh was eye-opening he always been like uh let's say 
[01:40:00]  uh rookie rookie that's a new word he's always been rookie man like you know people that helped him  uh he he forgot you know he don't have no nothing nice to say to them you know like all the guys that  he fought over the years you know they call him bear gorilla well i think i was a gorilla  my part uh bear gorilla you know ugly and like uh you know he was light bright damn near white 
[01:40:30]  well joe you he came out afterwards he came out afterwards in the new york times and said that  was just to promote the fight but do you think that's bullshit do you think that that went way  beyond promoting the fight i got a few more words there it's not a bullshit  there's a lot more behind it because you know like uh i i think the guy probably was more nervous  with some of the opponents you know i mean that he didn't really show what he's gonna try to crank 
[01:41:00]  him up to get them wild i get them to say different things you know to make them nervous  that they don't want to fight him you know what i mean yeah that's the way it was so we talked  the more he talked the harder i trained oh yeah yeah i asked him when the bell rang i hope you got  your lunch oh yeah you know you don't have no bricks in between would it frustrate you and i'm sorry  would it frustrate you because he was taunting foreman in uh in zaire would it frustrate you 
[01:41:30]  in those moments when he was holding your head and trying that psychological game on you or would  it not bother yeah he mugged me with on the second fight all night long mugged you mugged me like he  want to kiss me i don't want to kiss me we were there to fight not to hug and i kiss each other you  know i mean yeah for the people that don't know there were three fights the first one uh fraser won  no i want all three of them i think i think so i'm sorry but stop being right there i want all three 
[01:42:00]  of me i mean you can you can look at him now we had three fights you know i'm walking i'm talking  you know i mean he ain't nothing but a hound dog you know all the time so i'm like uh i'm enjoying life  you're enjoying life and ali is pretty much in his own little uh prison there well so that's what you  mean by you winning all all the fights and the main thing about it was it wasn't you and i you know i 
[01:42:30]  mean you look back the things he said at time and by you know like i'm not making anything up i am the  greatest i am the prettiest i am the fastest you see now you can't be no d yeah me you can be the but we  can't be the yeah that's the up there and he tried to warn him to have the action to back off  and that d he never he never did what the lord asked him to do so that way you think he'd be  punished for his arrogance in a way like or or his uh his complete arrogance you're saying like 
[01:43:00]  well i i didn't think that the arrogant part of uh him being like that the good man you you and i  can't be the because we don't use that word d me you ain't use d since you've been a head dog  he is the man of staff you know that and he said i am the greatest i am the prettiest i am the  fastest it was a great good man came in took over well jimmy let's start with this now joe you and 
[01:43:30]  ali were friends and you know yeah and no now we wasn't the friends like it's like me you can go out  and have a good time but you guys looked out for each other and we were friends to get the job done yeah  and when and when ali was out of the fight game you were there for him and you were helping him out  and you gave him a little loan and you you were you pretty much got him back back into the uh the  fight game i'm the man who went to the white house action president you talked to nixon that's right  action president give my his own film so i ain't not no lying about it he's not bragging about it but 
[01:44:00]  he asked me to go and talk to him i went and talked to the president to give him a license and it  worked it worked he gave a joke you think i got it in my back pocket brother you also gave ali money  because he was down on his luck how much money was it i need to know i don't know about 500  no big money okay you know i mean back in them days it was big money but you know uh i never got it back  yeah yeah so but alone to some guys like that's no problem you know i mean yeah had you fought had 
[01:44:30]  you guys fought once by then by the time ali left uh boxing was was asked to leave boxing because of  vietnam you had said fought once or twice by then none no you hadn't fought no no none you the war  you you you didn't oh you that's right you first fight was 71 that's right that's right he started  fighting ali after after ali came back matter of fact uh the war stopped for uh an hour  of the fight how do you like that you know two athletes stopped the war now if you can do that 
[01:45:00]  kind of work you are he should be able to go over and talk to them people and get them their models  together you know i mean but therefore he probably yeah so i he did probably didn't have that kind of  pull like you thought you did you know i mean i i learned a lot from this movie um the one thing that  was amazing to me how ali uh made it sound like if you uh rooted for joe frazier you were you know 
[01:45:30]  you you were against the black man and ali was all about you know if if you root for me you're rooting  for the black man and what's strange about that is like how you were brought up where you live to this  day you know you live in a pretty rough neighborhood in philly to this day the neighborhood is the best  neighborhood in the world you know wherever you carry yourself man well you you can't you can walk  in can i walk through there sure no problem nobody don't bother you you ain't bothering nobody but you 
[01:46:00]  go around shaking somebody's feather a leaf you're gonna get rain on you heard that but but how much  did that bother you that he don't bother me at all man no back then when he's trying to tell everybody  that you're didn't bother me it didn't bother me at all you you see how slow i got you see i walked  out on the fight you see i didn't punch it worried me uh i i asked him if he got his lunch that's all  yeah joe he ain't going nowhere he did the same thing to foreman in in in in africa he painted it 
[01:46:30]  where where he was kind of the black hope and foreman was a representative of the white man  that's everybody and mostly i think what mohammed did most of the time uh he probably was nervous  about us the guys that he had to fight at the time so therefore he was going to get hype up and  crazy get the other guy nervous you know i mean but because you know he didn't really know if these  guys were going to fight and when he got me oh my goodness he was really surprised you know i mean 
[01:47:00]  he thought he was going to go over there and run around and dance and and act a fool i'll show him  i'll show him where he's at you are a hard guy to hit joe you really were a joe we were just  watching footage of how you would literally duck down to waist level and come you almost  an impossible guy to get a good shot in on i'm a i'm a slippery yeah uh fast when i fast  in hand you know he glazed me up here sometimes close eyes you know that's all did he hit as hard as  foreman no no foreman nobody loves george george has a big george be tied up and still punch 
[01:47:30]  he's still punch hard he said i read for a great guy though he said he said that he was scared of  you foreman said that he was afraid of joe frazier and that was why he said when he knocked frazier down  the first time he was scared that he had really made you angry and that you were really going to  hurt him come and get him yeah he was afraid of you yeah i wish i wish was like that oh you don't 
[01:48:00]  believe him like that he's powerful he's a powerful guy he's a great guy you know uh he adds a lot of  good things to the boxing world and you know what we need to discuss now was made matter of fact i don't  know what they're doing because i don't know who's in which champion world uh those guys are them guys  who's uh being a part of this boxing world i would hope that somebody step up uh let's say god  bless my mrs ullman and the wbc at least two sanctions wouldn't be bad but all these crazy 
[01:48:30]  boxing they got one guy i thought was making love to the other one in the ring he got between his legs  and started pumping around and moving his body i said what are you doing it didn't look like no  fights was that concern yeah we were just talking about the lack of kind of excitement in boxing uh  now where where you know there's none of these fighters that you go holy shit i gotta see this 
[01:49:00]  fight a clean sports i mean boxing is one of the let's say the cleanest sports in the world you know  i mean we don't we don't start playing basketball in the ring we don't play hockey play football and  everybody in the world wants to fight on the court on the football field you know what i'm saying  we don't do that we don't play no baseball no basketball you don't try to do what they do  they try to do what you do fighting goes everywhere there you go right everybody wants like well why don't  they come down to the ring if you think you're that bad i'll make a comeback for some of them 
[01:49:30]  where would a guy like i'm sure people have asked this before but where would a guy like  mike tyson or like who was like one of the last big names or controversial names have stood up  against guys like ernie shavers or ken norton or guys from from your from your era but mike had  mike had cleaned his act up you know i mean and let's say uh you know you lost a daughter yeah yeah  i'm sorry to hear that mike you know but i've been this uh open of his film and uh he looked like he was 
[01:50:00]  a little small and happy yeah yeah i'm happy for that you know and sometime you you go into places  uh you just be related by the wrong kind of people you understand and i'm not gonna call  nobody but taking the name but you know yeah you don't have to you you know you know what i'm talking  about nobody will say don king i know i'm not gonna say it no no don's not a bad guy man is he not  no man don don got the money that's all you want he only thing he had to do is pay the money up that's 
[01:50:30]  all and that's a hard job but he got the he done the job right so don wasn't a bad guy no yeah it  wasn't one for you two for me one for you three for me no no it was like that's what it was the  manager go get half 50 50 all right right uh me uh the fighter go back and we get another 50 another 50  the managers don't know that time to pay your bill off see and don don't say no to the fighter the 
[01:51:00]  fighter is the guy that's doing the work so he gives him the money i get the tickets now when time  come to pay back oh the money got to come from you and the managers don't know about that see because  you went behind his back that's you can't do that that's not that's not a problem you know for a  fighter to do i've done that you know me but therefore i pay everybody back it was no crazy  discussion you know if i got your money and your ticket i want to pay you back let me ask you as a 
[01:51:30]  fighter because i've never been knocked out um when you when you're fighting a guy like you're in  you're a situation where george foreman hits you i've never been knocked out um you never but  so don't ask me no say knock down i've been knocked down yeah okay when a guy like foreman hits  you do you know like when he knocks you down the first time you're like oh it's gonna be a long  knife no no what i'm doing down here  get up off of that thing  yeah frazier was never knocked out and you only lost the three guys you lost a foreman 
[01:52:00]  alley and who's the third guy yeah who's the third guy i don't even know he's no third guy  i really don't know i lost i lost two fights oh so there isn't a third guy george roman  mohammedy never beat me all right i keep forgetting alley didn't beat you look at him now look at me  i forgot you're right you're right you're right  ain't no sense in going home but judy got your gal and go 
[01:52:30]  you're pretty happy that uh at least in the state he's in huh well no i'm not no i'm not happy you  know like sometimes we don't look at the things that we say and we do sometimes god's a great god  you understand what's your and man let me finish you don't you don't go around talking about i am the  and you could be the this that the you don't use that word that's that's the king's word yeah 
[01:53:00]  the man above about the when we start talking about him we can talk about the the master so  this is god's payback there you go god said shut that down and he didn't listen well you really  believe that alley is the way he is because because of uh you right and not the parkinson's  all right do you believe the beatings you gave him i i i well i was gonna say the thrill of manila  fight it's such an amazing fight a lot of people told ali you're done don't fight anymore and he 
[01:53:30]  fought for what another five years guess guess what you look at the family you be the judge i'm not  gonna i'm not gonna say one word you know we had three fights look at me ain't no sense i'm going home  i'm sure we got together and go joe and the knockouts getting back together that's the  question joe and the knockouts i let's say uh i lost uh two fights as yours won okay all the rest of 
[01:54:00]  my fights now you want to i want you to get my record okay tomorrow and look at it and it goes like  this ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko knock out knock out knock out knock out knock out knock out  that's how my record goes so therefore i lost two fights to george you know he does not and he was  big whoo he's a big guy the 14th round yeah let's go ahead jimmy the 14th round we want to talk about  the 14th round at uh thriller in manila one of the most famous rounds ever fought i mean you guys 
[01:54:30]  you fought i think two 15 round fights and this was your 14th round and when you look back which  you guys didn't know at the time ali had told dundee to cut the gloves off he couldn't come out  and you wanted to keep fighting yeah and your guy stopped the fight because he was afraid you were  going to get mortally wounded he was really afraid no the guy that stopped the fight because the guy  knew i had two implanted limbs in my eyes and i wasn't supposed to be fighting but therefore i got by 
[01:55:00]  the judges you know read the sign o f p z next time c i t that was up the same eye  covered up the same eye with the other hand  he switched hands yeah covered the same what's joe joe's referencing beautiful no one really knew that  joe couldn't really see out of his left eye right no one knew i had your people knew but the opponents 
[01:55:30]  never knew that you could not see out of how much vision in the left eye when you were fighting  i would say my great doctors know that's why i love them those guys well if we if we didn't have  those guys man where would we be think about that you know today they can take your heart out  put it on the table operate on it put it back take it long out answer go out there and get somebody's  heart somebody's long i mean who would have thought something like this could happen  so the doctor was there for me but what was what was the percentage of sight in your left eye when 
[01:56:00]  you're in your prime when you're fighting all these guys the eye was gone what happened when i  laid off for a while i came back when i took on george i had a lens now if you could remember the  first round was stopped the first fight was stopping first round the second fight was stopping the six  seven round when george knocked that lens out the night that i couldn't tell him wait a minute  you can't start looking around for a lens on the canvas yeah i might tell him time george to meet my 
[01:56:30]  eyes yeah trying to put it in with the glove so i went i went to war with him when the lens was  knocked out of my eyes as long as i was boxing and moving it was okay but getting back to the thrill in  manila so we're talking about the left eye you couldn't really see out of right and now ali's working  in your right eye yeah so by the end of 14 rounds you're in the corner and you're pretty much blind  you could see maybe a out of a slit of your right eye maybe i'm gonna stay close to him but there 
[01:57:00]  but uh adi said no you ain't going out there i'm not gonna be responsible but didn't eddie look over  to ali's corner and go he doesn't look too good either okay that's what i don't understand i don't  think i don't think he even warned about that because he was because how ali was slumped in the  in his corner he looked like he was in deep trouble too all right and then someone from  your camp was sitting close to ali and heard ali say cut the gloves i'm done we couldn't we 
[01:57:30]  we couldn't go along with that because we couldn't hear it from his corner but then you know hey listen  i'm happy with the way things went you know i mean you know and now i hear i'm making movies i'm  going out i'm still talking to the people yeah ain't no sense i'm going home you still have golden  pipes joe that's what's important hey did you ever resent did you ever resent the public because uh  for the way that they embraced ali were you ever just angry at the public for not seeing him the 
[01:58:00]  way you saw him no it's just a lot of people that in this world you know there's enough people for me  to share with him the people so if people love him better than do me it's okay no problem they  probably didn't love him they love the style and they love the noise he makes and they like what the  way he handled so they were they were also people like love me because i come to get the job done  i asked him did you bring your lunch because i ain't going nowhere you know i mean so this kind 
[01:58:30]  of thing the world have to share you know we all have like share some some as long as not crazy  vision as long as it's a good idea good embraces the people why not enjoy you know one of my favorite  moments from the uh from the thrill in manila is and i had never seen this before there's great  footage of joe and ali on a talk show and he has just had enough of ali and frazier stands up  and he he wants to knock ali's teeth out on the set of this tv show and you punked ali because 
[01:59:00]  ali's like sit down joe and you wouldn't sit down and uh and uh yeah they kind of tussled on the  floor a little bit it was the brother was in see the brother got into it yeah big he had nothing  to do with yeah comes walking into the he had nothing to do with but he was there and like you  know what was two brothers against me one so i grabbed the closest guy to me was his mom and so i  got double on the floor he saw joe's joe's look though joe was really just ready to street fight  him right there in the tv studio it was so great i've never seen that footage before and that wasn't 
[01:59:30]  to hype the fight or no no that was just pure anger on your part mr frazier that was my  common smoke that's right who was the second who was the second greatest fighter ever i mean  obviously number one is joe frazier well who's number two let's let's see as we go along any young  men all young ladies reached the epitome of being the champion is a lot of work they they have reached  their greatness you know i mean they're right they have that same margin as lewis let's say marciana 
[02:00:00]  all the dempsey all them great guys man we have reached that level of being a champion where else  can you go when you got to be the champion of the world now you're talking about uh the whole entire  world the station today i don't really like what's really going on so when i get a little  quiet down and rest a little bit and get up all those shocks that i had i lost a son uh friday  uh saturday on saturday some guy arrived by the bar and shot in the bar and killed him jesus 
[02:00:30]  sorry grandson so uh i gotta go back and start all over again i haven't been able to get down to  my family yet because i've been traveling so far right i came in saturday morning from london wow  and this happened like sunday morning damn yeah so i i gotta go back and find out what to do with him  and see if we can track this scam book now and i hope they would give him to me i'd like to do a 
[02:01:00]  couple rounds with him with his hand tied you look like you can still do a lot of damage i shook your  hand when you walked in you still have i'm 65 and i feel good the lord been let's say terribly good to  me and i love it i got 11 beautiful kids about 36 grand wow you know since i'm going home 
[02:01:30]  you're not fighting you're fucking  who's your who's your what y'all was fussing who was your travel companion in the thriller in manila  she was interviewed a few times and i need to know more about your travel companion  in the movie it's a it's a white lady she had like a philadelphia accent i don't remember they  said joe's travel companion i don't remember they just kept her what the travel companion she's my  secretary secretary yeah okay yeah and she was great the beauty of the thrill in manila too ali 
[02:02:00]  went there with his mistress and he was partying having a good time and joe's like fuck that he  left his hotel went on the outskirts of uh town and just and all he thought about was the fight  as ali was just having a good old time yeah well and that's when that's how you surprised ali because  ali thought it was a it was going to be an easy fight for him now well uh a man lifestyle is  lifestyle and you know and you can't break that away from right away sometimes we go to the graveyard  like that you know you can't make no changes yeah and the way he would have been trained uh it's no 
[02:02:30]  way that he's gonna be able to get around with a guy like me all that's a monster maybe even mike  guy's gonna take you so you know it's the idea that you know you can't do that but ali was cocky  because uh a great part of this film brings the mistress to manila goes to see the marcos right  and all the press is there and he basically introduces her as his wife i don't mean that 
[02:03:00]  yeah his wife his wife is back home going what the fuck gets on a plane the first plane to manila  i only had some shit you guys on the air you guys on the air all the crazy language  we can curse yeah  satellite radio  no no no it's okay it's satellite radio satellite radio joe come on times have changed yeah  satellite radio satellite radio yeah  give us a curse joe oh so you can sit in words huh oh yeah  yeah yeah no beeping give us a good one  this is how you guys show go  joe had a great quote 
[02:03:30]  actually that's what ali thinks every morning  i think marvis actually said this in the document i think it was marvis who said that um  you were watching ali light the olympic torch and and i think he said like wow what do you think of  that and you said uh they should push him into the fire  holy yeah he did say that  joe said that about ali  shh  they should push him  yeah 
[02:04:00]  and the voicemail thing i got it here  joe yeah  if you call joe's voicemail i'll just jump in this is what you get ant  if he doesn't answer the phone live  oh let's hear  my name is smoking joe freight  sharp as a razor  yeah it feels like the butterflies  things like to me i'm the man and the job you know  look and see  call me  bye bye  i'm the man who done the job look and see  wow 
[02:04:30]  yeah  the fight's been good to me and i really love it  and i i just want to  tell the people you know like uh  who gets in it you know it's not a it's not a game  your life is on the line  you can get hurt in gym  you can get hurt on the road in the morning  running somebody dug a hole  uh dug in the ground you don't see  break your leg break your neck  so these things can happen  in any kind of sports 
[02:05:00]  but boxing  is my game  and i love it i don't want to go back to where  it's been so  a man can say i've been i'm a world champion  right on  then they'll feel better you know but  what's all going on i don't know  i'm going down to talk to the president  i promise you that i'm gonna make  i'm gonna make a step toward that  as soon as those things quiet down  he got he got a heavy load  yeah he's a little busy  he got a heavy load on his back  yeah north korea's been misbehaving lately 
[02:05:30]  yeah  you don't need no more of that  you know i mean  i'll get around like maybe  now he owns a car company too so  joe i know we got to get you out of here in a couple minutes  but uh  the one thing  one other thing about the documentary  kind of made me sad  you're living in a room  above your gym  the great joe frazier  it's in the movie  thrill in manila  where are you living  miles was done by  the lady was on the  on the screen  on television  yeah  and she runs like a big business 
[02:06:00]  in wildwood pennsylvania  wildwood new jersey  right  and successful  and you go in  in the restaurant  and it's like this  look around  the father got  stuffed animals  all over the place  it's a beautiful place  and they open like  six  six months  out of the year  you know  as long as the summer  goes on  for  people that comes down 
[02:06:30]  and she does a fine job  my house  on top of the gym  it was  you go in  and do this  and my house  was dang near  three about  two hundred square feet long  two hundred thousand square feet long  my house  okay  and it was nice  I mean  okay  nobody's gonna come up  and bother me  I ain't gonna go  that ain't bother  nobody else  you just like living there  I like living there  there you go  why spend 
[02:07:00]  two hundred thousand dollars  of a house  and  I got a house  on top of the gym  just as comfortable  everything is at my hand  so  at least I don't know  swim pool  because I can't swim  and he's still training fighters  how's Marvin doing  Marvin's doing great  he's a preacher  you know  no I did not know that  he was good in the film  very good  yeah he's a good guy  he's a good minister  you know  he's a good father  yeah  he lost his wife  a few years back man 
[02:07:30]  from what  yeah  colon cancer  then he had to take care of the girls  he got his hands full  he thought I'm getting married now  you know  I don't know  well  I'm not married  I tell him sons  you don't need a wife right now  yeah dad  but you know  I can't  I'm a minister  so I know that too  but you're breathing  I mean  you heard me right  oh yeah  I've been cutting corn with me 
[02:08:00]  now you're still Joe Frazier  are you still  women still have to  you're still picking up women  because you're Joe Frazier  they're still at least coming to you  and you know  you know  do you still get  yeah yeah  well  this is what happened  I was a guy like this  you know  I ain't gonna give you  no more than I can take  you know what I'm saying  I'm a big family  I came from a big family  about 16  17 brothers and sisters  and I was a baby 
[02:08:30]  I was daddy's pet  you know what I'm saying  me and my daddy  went everywhere together  and I've seen everything he does  but therefore  not right down  to the nitty gritty  you know  I probably  peep around  he probably  steal a little kiss  mom and dad gone  so I can talk now  he steal a little kiss  every now and day  you know  so  dad went in the front of the house  and I went in the back  you read 
[02:09:00]  you read between that a lot  yeah  doing a lot of that today  Joe  and also  I want to promote  Joe's website too  you can get signed stuff  from Joe  he sells it off  from his website  and it's  joefraser.com  and there's all kinds  of stuff there  there's photos  and you can get  a whole bunch of stuff  of Joe's merchandise  on the website  which is you know  it's a great chance  to pick up  extra in common  probably one of the most  recognizable fighters  walking around  you get recognized a lot  well I only get recognized  a lot  listen I think  I went to like 
[02:09:30]  Malaysia  I went to  let's say  the last place  on the world  I forgot the name  England  France  Cleveland  where you went  Cleveland  New Zealand  okay  oh damn  that's the last one  they don't know you  in New Zealand  you can't go no further  yeah  they like  they look like  the end of the world 
[02:10:00]  yeah they're too busy  with their sheep  to know who Joe Frazier is  but I know  the good people  they're like maybe  year two behind us  but they're all good fans  that's true  hey Joe  did you  you cut up your  Olympic gold medal  into 11 pieces  for all your kids  is that true  yes I did  huh  who got  I love them all  you got an extra piece  laying around  I wouldn't mind  yeah  I wouldn't mind  a piece of gold medal  well you ought to  talk to them about that  yeah  yeah right  they gave them away 
[02:10:30]  yeah  I don't really know  what the  some of us still have it  I know one daughter  lost  lost hers  lost her  well you know  the old man  might have borrowed  for something  you know  oh wow  but he went on  don't worry about him  he had to talk  to the Lord  lost anymore  the other guy  he took a trip down  yeah  yeah  so it's good to know  that Joe Frazier  made up with Muhammad Ali  that's what we're learning today  they're good buddies now  and uh 
[02:11:00]  did he  that's a good question  did Ali  after the fight  he apologized  he brought in your son  and he said  uh  because Ali was just  saying how tough you were  and what a great fighter you were  and he apologized to your son  for all the things he said  and said tell your father  and you said  well why didn't he come  and say that to me  that's right  that's right  has he ever  have you spoken to him  since then  uh  couple  maybe a couple times  he can't  he can't play himself  like you and I  you know  so he can't  you know  and see all that  all that work  that work couldn't be done 
[02:11:30]  by you and I  you know man  that had to have been  the man above  because you know  he had the same amount  of fights  that you and I had  even less  less fights  because these guys  never went the distance  you know what I'm saying  right  I've lost two to George  that I would admit to  you know  and then  let's see  with uh  tough guy  with Bonaventure  whoo  he was tough  who  and then  Bonaventure  oh Bonaventure  yeah Oscar  Oscar Bonaventure 
[02:12:00]  he's uh  he's gone on now  uh  he went out there  and messed around  with a Mustang woman  out in Vegas  okay  yeah  oh Mustang Ranch  Mustang Ranch  yeah  oh okay  you know  you know what happened  no  don't worry about it  what happened Joe  wait what happened  sounds like it's a good story  I got shot  you got shot  yeah  at the Mustang Ranch  you got shot at the Mustang Ranch  oh  oof  well if you're gonna get shot anywhere  I appreciate it was there  yeah it was there  uh  let's see  no I'm gonna put it 
[02:12:30]  before I get in trouble  uh  he uh  took one of the ladies with him  back into this country  and I think she came back home  and he asked a fool  and came over here to get her  oh boy  ain't no sense in going home  Jesus  keep  me  in there  across  Joe enjoys singing  I don't mind Joe singing 
[02:13:00]  he's alright  Joe's still got a left hook  Joe's still got a left hook  he can sing all he wants  hell yeah  no no no  I'm looking at the ring  Joe's got some great jewelry  I mean you have  champion jewelry  he's got a great gold  uh  necklace with a crown on it  and a giant  gold ring  and that ring would really hurt  if it crashed in your cheek  no no no no  let me explain  this  this is my sign  I'm a Capricorn  uh  let's say  a king on top  and a boxing gloves  uh  my doctor gave me that 
[02:13:30]  uh  this is a  uh  $10 gold piece  my doctor gave me that  uh  my son gave me this  for a championship fight  you can see my finger  I've been trying  to get out of here  and see you guys  so fast  I left my ring home  see I was like  that shit  the finger didn't  with the ring  so  wow  it's like  life's been good  to me  and you know  I love people  I came from  my big family  and let's say 
[02:14:00]  I can't get too loud  because my grandmother  was light bright  almost white  oh yeah  a blonde  a black blonde  I eat like that  really  my grandma  on daddy's side  mama's side  was Indian  uh  leader in his lawn  you know  they got  no trouble  beside me  you beat them up  hey Joe  there's a thing too  when you  all those years  when you and Ali  were having your 
[02:14:30]  your problems  and uh  you would refuse  I think he had  a resentment against you  because you beat him  you were the first guy  to beat Muhammad Ali  and uh  did you ever call him Ali  or were you always  insisting on calling him  Cassius Clay  well  out of respect  you know  and like  you know  if you want  to have that  that's his name  he won't  I'll call him Muhammad  you know  but if he gets me mad  I can go the other  way too  you know  and uh  I don't 
[02:15:00]  I don't think  it's right  for any young man  to change his name  once mama  uh  carry you for nine months  and help you out  with mourning  and then if I give you  a name  they can't change  my name  I'm sorry  mama said  Muhammad or Joseph  they're gonna stay there  yeah I think you said  that too  nobody's gonna do that  yeah  didn't you say that  his mama called him Clay  I'm gonna call him Clay  wasn't that your call  no no no no  his mother called him  Clay 
[02:15:30]  I said my mother  gave me my name  I'm gonna keep my name  I'm not  nobody changed my name  you know  the good man above  but not  not the organization  yeah cause he was angry  I think that  that you  he's like  he won't even call me  he said at one point  that you wouldn't call him  Ali  oh yeah  that was well documented  in the film  well Joe man  I beat him up  so I should be able  to call him what I want  whatever you want  you certainly did  that's for sure  I mean uh  you stood 44 out of 44  out of 45 rounds 
[02:16:00]  and I stood up to fight  yeah  yeah he's insane  alright Joe's now  punching himself  Joe has a  but you have a rock hard  I don't know why I'm surprised  Joe Frazier has a rock hard stomach  let Joe just punch you  in the shoulder  no  old school  just a little punch  in the shoulder  it wouldn't hurt anyone  right Joe  nah man  he's a little  he's a little small guy  I'm a little fella  might come up his bones  you know what I mean  hey Joe  you like the UFC 
[02:16:30]  what's that  the mixed martial arts  fighters  the ultimate fighting  uh you escaped me  I didn't know what you were  talking about  the MMA  the karate fighting mix  no  you don't like it  no it's  it's no  there should never be  a  a answer  for  the fight game  fight games  nobody changing the rules  in the boxing game  in the basketball game  you gotta change the rules  in the football field  after the basketball  or hockey  why boxing  you know what I mean  he's aware how to make  a lot of money 
[02:17:00]  and  what's it called  what the world will be  we're just  we're just  we're just missing  compromising  we're just missing  the great fighters though Joe  we were talking  before you came in here  what was the last  great fight  great boxing match  and we have to go back  almost 10 years  10 11 years  we're thinking  Mayweather's pretty  Mayweather's a big fighter though  Mayweather gets a lot of  interest  not as much  like when you and Ali fought  or you and Foreman fought  the whole world  wanted to know  everybody  in England  the whole world 
[02:17:30]  watched  there's no more of that  well you  go back  and you'll lose  those guys  won't see what goes on  why  why  it's just to the point  where the money is great  the money is great  so everybody wants to get in  and get their condolgion  you know what I mean  new word  right  and that's the way  how they look at  they can come in  and get a little bruise  and bubble  a little slash  like the rassets 
[02:18:00]  you know what I mean  they bleed  and nobody's seen  got hit  how that happened  okay  I'm sorry about that  but you know  it's just one of them things  that goes on  man  that you know  they gotta get it back  where it used to be  right  that's all I can say  and uh  alright  I'm gonna go and talk  to the president  about it  I hope that he'll accept it  I'll point me out  to somebody  I'm gonna carry more  than me one  get a couple of guys  you know 
[02:18:30]  who feel that way  to a box  and you know  go up and sit down  oh I thought you meant  some muscle  bring some muscle  with you to the White House  no man  it's gotta be nice  to be Joe Frazier though  just to say  look I wanna go  talk to the president  no  I'm not gonna  bug him  because I know  he got his hands  full right now  but maybe when  people gonna cool off  and chill out  I'll go and talk to him  you should go  and then just stay  until they throw you out  that's what I would  I ain't no runaway guy 
[02:19:00]  no  just take a punch  from Joe  I don't wanna take  a punch from Joe  just in the shoulder  Joe how about a little jab  a little jab to Norton  look he moved his shoulder  nice and everything  toward you  how embarrassing  would it be  if he hit me in the shoulder  and I died  that would be embarrassing  alright we should get Joe  out of here  hey Joe  this thriller in Manila  was great  it's Ali vs. Frazier  a vicious rivalry  and the greatest fight  of all time  and it comes out  on DVD today  and I can't believe 
[02:19:30]  I'm not just saying this  because you're here  I cannot believe  how good this was  it's different  than when we were kings  so if you saw that  and you like it  this is the same style  but it's a totally  different fight  totally different interviews  Ferdy Pacheco  is great in this  the people from your corner  and your camp  that are in this  are great  it was really moving  I was surprised  at how moving this was  Butch Lewis  was really funny  in the film  good old Butch  oh yeah  the guy that's  oh Butch  is my good friend  I know  we know that Joe  he was great 
[02:20:00]  and Pacheco  do you wanna give him  a left hook or what  who's it  Ferdy  you like Ferdy right  Ferdy Pacheco  Pacheco  I didn't follow  too much  about what he was doing  but then  Butch was always there  for the guys  Butch is like  let's say  Don King  I mean  he talks a lot  you know what I'm saying  but the money is there  right  I mean you can't remember  a lot of fighters  don't like Don King  though Joe  come up with that money  big one  a lot of fighters 
[02:20:30]  don't like Don King  Joe  we've had Don King  on the show  can't get a word  what have you done  me  what  what did he do  he said  why don't people like him  they basically  say that  you know  Don King  took a lot more money  than he should  no  no  no  no  no  no  the government  ain't gonna let him  do that  the boxing commissioner  ain't gonna let him  do that  so now  but the fighter  gets the money  but therefore  one time  to pay the money back 
[02:21:00]  he take a vacation  like you don't remember  you know what I mean  like  well  why you take this back  because you got it  alright  you got this amount of tickets  you got this amount of money  what you want me to  pay for the fight  pay you  pay the other guy  and then for tickets too  no  the man can't do that  he was only being nice  to the guy  but I think  he's a great guy  you know  he sought this 
[02:21:30]  big stuff  with the money anyway  but he come out  of the clink  yeah  yeah  so  yeah I mean look  he's got an amazing story  Don King has an amazing story  I mean you know  been in jail  he killed two people  I think  and you know  look at him now  alright well  the great Joe Frazier  yeah I love this  I love this  DVD  it was really  really moving  and Joe is in it  Ali's not in  When We Were Kings  Joe is in this  and he's interviewed  through the whole thing  and you're brutally honest  you're brutally honest  and Joe is one of the few guys alive 
[02:22:00]  who is not in awe  of Muhammad Ali  when they finally showed  some footage  we're trying to get you out of here  but then there's other things  that pop in your head  when you're in your  you're in your boxing gym  and they finally show footage  from Thrilla in Manila  and you're watching it  and in the documentary  it says that you're watching this  for the first time  is that true?  that's true  you just didn't want to see  this fight after it was done  well  I don't  what can I learn  out of it  right  but you would think  if you're involved  with pretty much 
[02:22:30]  the greatest fight  of all time  that you would have seen  a couple times  over the years  I can't get very good  to train these guys  if I look at somebody else  seeing what they're doing  right or wrong  that's how I feel about it  right  if I don't look at this guy  and see what they're doing wrong  I'm never going to learn anything  from looking at my fan  and then I'm going to rerun  I can't add anything  that's had the fan go wrong  it's already done  it was a great moment  watching you watch this fight  for the first time  you could see in your eyes  like you're really  you're there  you're reliving it 
[02:23:00]  like holy shit  you knew exactly  what combo  you were ready  to hit him with  and everything  I might have  some of the older fights  locked up upstairs  in my house  you know  maybe now  but then I don't know  I look at guys  like Sugar Ray  Armstrong  Joe Lewis  Bob Siena  I can learn from them guys  but what am I going to learn  from me  you're not going to rerun  I was thinking more  nostalgia Joe  you're looking at your old work  like oh my god 
[02:23:30]  yeah this brings back memories  kind of like looking at  a film of a  I don't know  family vacation  who's the greatest fighter  of all time  you think was Sugar Ray Robinson  what  greatest fighter of all time  do you think it was Ray Robinson  you leave me out  no no no  I'm saying  Joe now you got to punch him right  see now you got to take  the punch on Joe  I was saying who would Joe pick  because I asked that question earlier  and I said who's the second greatest fighter  acknowledging that Joe Frazier  is the greatest ever  Jim  I was talking about not heavyweights  oh I'm sorry 
[02:24:00]  you're trying to get out of me  I like my teeth  I feel like any time  one of the guys  have reached that epitome  of being  a champion  you know  it takes a lot of  desire  and let's say  sacrifice  see what I mean  why  some guys  is like stumbling  on the base  they can't talk  they can't sing  ain't no sense  and go home 
[02:24:30]  you know  they can't really  do this thing  it's not because  somebody  laid some  morning  he was a great fighter  you know  he didn't sacrifice  sacrifice  is where you got  the control  when you gotta leave  the wife  the kids  the girlfriend  the good boyfriend  if he's a girl  you know what I'm saying  it's to the point  that you gotta  put all the things aside  there's no loving  going on  for seven to eight weeks  right  right  right  women weak in legs 
[02:25:00]  right  yeah  that was one of the sayings  I don't know  I don't know  about that  because I went to  training camp  for seven weeks  eight weeks  you know what I mean  so no sex  for seven to eight weeks  before a fight  that's right  I come to win the fight  yeah  you got a lot of poison  and I ain't gonna get weak  a lot of poison  Joe why do the white guys  bleed more than the black guys  in the ring  why the what  the white guys bleed more  in the ring  like Chuck Webner  comes to mind  that doesn't necessarily  have to be a color  on it  oh my god 
[02:25:30]  I just probably have  softer skin  skin probably softer  alright  so a lot of guys  light bright  damn near white  he probably not bleed  you know what I mean  because his skin is tough  yeah  and I didn't  I got  alcohol  and water  and  washed my face  a lot of it  tough on my skin  alright  so I went  and let's say  I had one cut  but that big guy  he put an uppercut 
[02:26:00]  in my mouth  boom uppercut  but therefore  I still got  those are your real teeth  I said  they're all mine  damn  he fought  Ollie three times  and Foreman twice  and still has all of his  real teeth  that's pretty impressive  I got all of mine  I've been a bit of it  that's pretty impressive  alright  they're saying  they're gonna  oh we're okay  okay cool  alright  they're putting us out  no no no  we're okay  we didn't know the gag  Jesus  yeah  there's a great scene 
[02:26:30]  in when we were  in Thriller in Manila  when  when he  Ollie punches your  he punches your mouthpiece  and it flies out  and goes into the  the fifth row  of the press  and it's a great shot  it's a really quick shot  if you didn't know  what was happening  you would think  something flew across the screen  but he punches your mouthpiece out  and you just  you still keep fighting  keep going  and he still has his teeth  probably  he didn't 
[02:27:00]  knock the bunch  he just protect  the front of your teeth  back here  he's not gonna shake it  the majority  of the front teeth  gradually get  the whack in  more than anything else  you know  and  God  blessed me  to keep all of mine  I got them all  and like  I don't  I don't  I don't think  I have no bad ones  no your teeth  look fantastic  what's that  they look good  yeah  they're all mine 
[02:27:30]  they're mine  and now  because  let's see  my fight was like this  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  knock out  I  let's see  I had a hundred fights  I had a hundred fight  amateurs  and pro  I think I lost  two to George  and that was it  and I lost  the rest of the guys  got knocked out  so Joe  are you gonna sing again  I mean not  I mean you went out  and sang for a little while  right years ago  you were going out  on the road  and singing 
[02:28:00]  why'd you stop doing that  you wanna ask this one  I certainly do  and now  the time is near  the time is here  check my hopes  and  prepare  I say  to take the dare  oh man  it's time to climb  ride through  them ropes  and  face a man  have a plan  but stage that plan  not in the shy way  well that's his right  but come to fight 
[02:28:30]  heck  I'll fight  in my  my way  oh so you did the  Sinatra song  your own way  no  Paul Lankin  wrote them legs  for me  oh did he really  yeah  okay  yeah he fought  the last one  the listeners want  a clean version  of ain't no sense  in going home  because they want  a ringtone  can you give us  a little ain't no sense  can you use  ain't no sense  in going home  because they want  to save it  as their ringtones  who say that  the listeners want  to hear  that when you  were singing  ain't no sense  in going home  yeah 
[02:29:00]  can you sing  that line  ain't no sense  in going home  Jody got you  getting gone  gotta go to home  but you work  too hard  gotta go to home  but you work  too hard  all you fellas  just gather  around me  you must hear  what I'm talking  about  I wish I knew  the words  I want to belt  out a tune  with Joe  I want to sing  a song with  Frasier  I can't sing  though  take a left  Hawk Jimmy

[02:30:30]  you like  country western  I do but I  don't know  many country  westerns  well I pull  out of  Pittsburgh  rolling  on the  sea boat  I got  my diesel  on up  and I'm  running  like I  never  before  scream  step  ahead  all right  I don't  see a cop  inside  six days  on the road  I'm gonna  make it  home tonight  I see the  ICC  checking on  down the line  I'm a little  overweight  my long  woods way  behind

[02:38:00]  early  he came a  half hour  early  so I had  quite a few  questions  prepared  and stuff  but we  kind of  covered  everything  I think  so  cell phone  message  I think  we did  good  and Jimmy  got some  really nice  autographs  I'll tell you  that much  yeah I got  Joe to sign  a glove  boxing glove  and the inside  of the DVD  is a picture  of Joe  and Ali  punching  it's a black  and white  photo  so I asked  Joe to sign  that to me  but I'll never  sell this stuff  man  I gotta get  a couple hundred  bucks for it  it's just  something I'll just  get more than that  a signed  fucking  glove 
[02:38:30]  I was about  to say  golfing glove  boxing glove  or Joe Frazier  I have another  one I told you  it's got  De La Hoya  Larry Holmes  Jake LaMotta  all those people  but I'm not  going to sell  that either  I took that  last time  it was over  I want it  I'll give it back  I've been just  using it at the gym  because I've been  hitting the heavy bag  lately  I figured he didn't  mind  I do  you were wrong  after the interview  we took pictures  with Joe  hilarious  yeah  oh yeah  he gave me a fake 
[02:39:00]  gut punch  he might as well  have hit me  the fear I felt  and I doubled over  like he really did  hit me  it was  it was one of those  things where  you know  the typical picture  you put your arm  around the guy  he puts his arm  around you  and you take a  picture like your  pals  well they were  doing that  and Joe Frazier  moved so fast  and threw this  fake punch at  Opie's stomach  and stopped  just short  of Opie's stomach  Opie actually  bent up  doubled over  and went like  whoa  I was just 
[02:39:30]  waiting for the  pain  yeah  like you know  you get hit  and it usually  takes a split  second  then you feel it  that's what I was  waiting for  I'm like oh my god  he didn't actually  hit me  thank god  yeah  it really did  look like  is Kevin Smith  calling in  we have to call him  ok  he said to call him  yeah we can call him  if you want  I don't know  if we want to bother him  he said he'd call us  very busy man  he kind of did it  he promised he would  call from the set  of his new movie  he called but we were  with Joe Frazier  so he left his  contact info  maybe he's with Bruce 
[02:40:00]  I say we dial up  Kevin Smith  I don't want to be  a bother  oh my god  he's directing a movie  I know  Bruce Willis  and Tracy Morgan  oh who's this  they were doing  some filming  on the  what  the  BQA  BQA  that's great  stuck in traffic  the whole time  road stinks  Kevin asked  from Brooklyn  he actually left  yeah Joe's  gone  fucking the wolves  were hanging  outside our door  really  yeah the stupid wolves 
[02:40:30]  the wolves  grabbing all our guests  fucking wolves  the fuck man  oh were they  yeah the wolves  were just waiting  wow  waiting for our guests  to bring them  on to another show  I've heard that  before  yeah  where do you go  after a Joe Frazier  interview  he was singing  for 20 minutes  oh he was just  singing  I wish I knew a song  I wanted to belt  out a tune with Joe  he loves to sing  he sure does  he was in  the knockouts 
[02:41:00]  played at a place  my mother used to  work at  then my mother  asked him to sign  an autograph to me  and my brother  Joseph  oh that's a famous  story  yeah  so he asked  how do you spell  Anthony  and she told him  then he goes  how do you spell  Joseph  maybe he's not  a Joseph though  he's a Joe  but  I'm not a Gregory  I'm a Greg  yeah but Joe  I couldn't tell you  how to spell  Gregory  so he could have  just put Joe  I guess  I don't know  let's say hi  to Vernon  in Philly  Vernon  good morning guys 
[02:41:30]  how you doing  hey Vernon  yeah  did he come in  with the big hat  on again  yes he did  the big white hat  yep  yeah  that's been his Joe  with the big hat  and the Cadillac  you know  because like I said  I grew up right  like three blocks  from where he used  to have his gym  right up on Broad Street  and you know  it was like  you know  he used to  I mean  you see him up there  he used to help  you know  train guys  and you know  work guys out  and stuff like that  and actually 
[02:42:00]  you know  just to give you  a little tidbit  there was a lot  of good fighters  that used to come  to his gym  before Mike Tyson  had you know  got big and famous  he used to train  up there a couple times  and also  yeah Tyson  Tyson used to come  up there and train  I used to watch  him up there  and work out  the damn  big head  fucker guy  now  and it's silly now  you know  you're falling 
[02:42:30]  apart  I feel like  Joe's on the phone  yeah we're trying  to hang in there  but you're losing  us  yeah  I often used to  train up there  you know  so he had a lot  I mean he had  a lot of good guys  to come to his gym  and everything  and I mean  he's generally  just a good guy  I mean I know  a lot of you know  whatever he went  through  with the alley  situation  and that stuff  like that  but  but why is he  living in a room  above his gym  he's got to have  a house somewhere  I'm thinking  he has  but also 
[02:43:00]  right  he had made  a lot  he had gotten  involved in a lot  of bad  business decisions  and actually  I wish you  know  I tried to catch  him while he was  there  because I wanted  to see  whatever turned  out between  him and his  daughter  because him  and his  daughter  had went  through a  serious  situation  with a case  that was  I don't know  if it's still  going on  or not  where he was  actually suing  his daughter  she's a lawyer  Jackie Frazier  was a lawyer  and she was  defending him  to try to  get him  some money  back  and then  that went  bad  and then 
[02:43:30]  they had  a big fall  out  and he turned  around  and was suing  her  for what  reason  taking some  of his  money  no  no  no  because he  felt like  she was  he felt  that he  was being  taken for  a ride  from his  daughter  and he  turned around  and wanted  to try  to sue  her  but I  don't know  if he  ever got  his money  I forgot  how the  case was  going on  about  he was  trying to  sue  for some  back money  bad  business  mister  doesn't  really  know  the  details  guy  yeah  alright  thank you 
[02:44:00]  brother  yeah  thanks  later  man  the one  thing  Frazier  didn't  really  want  to  get  into  but  you  know  with  Ali  saying  that  he  fought  for  the  white  man  and  stuff  and  you  know  Frazier  was a  ghetto  guy  he  was born  raised  and still  lives  in the  ghetto  basically  of Philly  in the  ghetto  that had to  drive him  nuts  that he  couldn't  explain that  to the  press  like  what do  you mean  I'm  fighting  for the  white  guy  the  white  man  I'm  so much 
[02:44:30]  more  ghetto  than  Ali  ever  was  Ali  was  show  boating  but then  they had  the old  interviews  you know  white cab  drivers  oh  Frazier  all the  way  black  guys  I mean  Ali  figure that  shit  out  I  never  I  never  even  knew  it  was  a  black  versus  white  fight  with  two  black  fighters  amazing  just  amazing  how  Ali  was  able  to  pull  that  one  off  very  artistic  with his  speech  that  Muhammad  Ali  and then  of course  because  you know 
[02:45:00]  because  he  upset  God  God  punished  him  put him  in the  wheelchair  and made  it so  he can't  really  talk  because  he  mouthed  off  to  people  after  watching  this  documentary  I  understand  because  Frazier's  been saying  that the  reason Ali  is how  he is  he's been  saying this  for years  is because  of him  and I  was like  come on  but it  kind of  makes sense  because at  the end  of the  documentary  I mean  he took  a beating  and a  bunch of  his guys  said don't  fight  anymore  you're  not the  same  fighter  after  the 
[02:45:30]  thrill  in  Manila  and took  many more  beatings  in the  ring  for the  next  five  years  leading to  probably  what's going  on with him  nowadays  what's going  on with him  now  I thought  it was  from the  decon  foregone  the decon  foregone  will get  bugs at  your house  you just  sit and  forget it  but don't  forget to  leave the  house  because if  you lay  in here  breathing  this shit  in  you're not  going to  be able  to talk  the  instructions  say  sit in 
[02:46:00]  house  press  button  and leave  you never  left  I always  stay  I forget  something  I come  back in  the house  and I  hear the  hissing noise  and the  fog  and I  go  because I  forget  I go to  read the  directions  again  but I  can't  see  because  of the  fog  so I  go to  bed  and I  breathe in  the decon  foregone  too many  times  oh my  god  I had a  I had a  wine tasting  at my  house  yesterday  yeah  yes 
[02:46:30]  was that  good  on a  Monday  you know  what  it wasn't  a wine  drinking  it was  a wine  tasting  and I  made a  point of  not making  it a  wine  drinking  because  yes  it is  Monday  now I  had a  guy come  over  and  because I  got to  fill up  my  little  wine  closet  there  downstairs  but I  don't  know  shit  about  fucking  wine  what do  I  know  what do  I  know  huh  what are  you  drinking  champagne  champagne  so a  guy comes  over with a 
[02:47:00]  little bag  full of  wine and  we were all  sitting around  eating cheesy  crackers and  drinking some  good wine and  figuring out what  I want to stock  up the closet  with  how did he  how did he  get you to  taste the  next bottle  did he say  anything in  particular  what like pop  the cork  and try  the wine  wine  that's what  he's getting  at  I know  what he's  getting  at  I don't  think you  didn't get  it  no I  was  fucking  okay 
[02:47:30]  yes  this is  what he  said  she was  very badly  raped  you see  see I  don't know  why he  said that  and then  he goes  first he  actually  came  first he  actually  came in  good  evening  yes  then he  came in  and I  was  eating  food  all right  yeah  and then  try the  wine  he was  pouring some  and it was  good  and I  commented on  how good  it was  I'm 
[02:48:00]  pleased you  appreciate  good wine  yeah  see there's  the table  and of course  Keith there  and a lot  of bottles  of wine  I see a lot  of bottles  on the  kitchen  counter  and see  there's another  glass there  that all the  wine was  I was kind  of like  tasting and  then spilling  out the rest  of the wine  out of the  glass  so you could  try another  one  yeah  because you  know  if you  drink a lot  of wine  like that  differently  that's a 
[02:48:30]  hangover  that's a  problem  that's a  bad hangover  wine gives  you really  bad ones  but found  some good  some good  wines  gonna load  that goddamn  bitch up  ready to  rock and  roll  oh yeah  steven s  from bass  show writes  joe is  great  he's both  an incoherent  ex-boxer  and a tone  deaf singer  nice  let's say  hi to  jay in  south carolina 
[02:49:00]  jay  what do you  say fellas  hey  hey listen  uh  joe frazier  and he was  actually a  reason  ali  tried to  pull the  white man  stuff  joe frazier  was actually  born in  beaufort  south carolina  like he  was  he was  growing up  really perverse  had no money  his parents  didn't have  much money  just farmed  and stuff  and so  see ali  knew about  all that  stuff going  on  and so  he tried  to play  like the  revert  you know  the steel  switcheroo  and uh  but yeah  man he  actually  he didn't

Goddamn YouTube channels.  God, I'm so upset.  What the fuck is going on with that?  Let's get to the bottom of that.  Let's see.  This retard is making more sense than Frazier.  That's Peter in Massachusetts.  Why? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, here we go.  This is a pretty good line.  Let's say hi to Rick in St. Louis.  Rick.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hello, Rick.  Yeah, Jimmy,  you said he doesn't have an ounce of talent.  That's because he doesn't weigh an ounce.  Weigh an ounce.  Oh, yes.  Good point.  Wally in Jersey.  Wally.  Hey, how you doing?  Wally.  Hello, worst name ever.  Wally.  Hi, Wally.  Listen, it could be worse.  Hey, don't you have a brother named Wally?  No. 
[03:06:30]  No?  Well, regardless, this guy is Joe C.  This guy is Joe C from Kid Rock.  Yeah, Joe C kind of sounded like that a little bit.  He sounded exactly like Joe C from Kid Rock.  But now when he raps, he sounds the worst.  No, if you listen, he sounds exactly the same.  Let's not fight.  A little bajaria loser.  All right, we'll look into that.  Thank you, sir.  Chris the Trucker.  Chris?  Sounds to me like little Marky needs the spanking and needs to go back to church.  I kind of like little Marky.

Is he still doing that little Marky shit?  Who knows?  That guy looked like a pedo.  Yeah.  All right, Chris.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Love you.  Bye.  Bye.  I like this rap.  We'll take a fine little break.  Got food in front of us?  I don't have any food.  Oh, I got food.  Gregorio.  Oh, I got food.  Pretty good stuff.  Made it myself. 
[03:07:30]  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  All right.  Bless you.  Oh, old school.  84.  84.  Shot in the dark.  It's a very old.  Yeah.  This song is 25 years old.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  I've been thinking about that shit a lot lately.  So in 1984, a song that was 25 years old would have came out in 1969. 
[03:08:00]  59.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm doing that weird math lately.  Yeah, I'm doing the backwards thing to the forward thing.  It's like, all right.  I'm doing that weird math thing.  More time has passed since then.  Exactly.  Yeah.  The Beatles haven't even landed in 1959 yet.  Nancy Reagan is talking to Ronnie.  That's great.  Really?  Yeah.  What's she saying?  Reagan says Obama snubbed her.  Also says she sees Ronald's ghost and has little conversations, little chit-chats with 
[03:08:30]  Boo.  You think Ronnie's haunting her?  No, I just heard some of your jokes.  Boo.  Yes.  I'm haunting her.  Her big, giant head.  What is she saying about Ron?  I don't know if they have, like, complete conversations.  It's a little vague.  She kind of feels...  No, because he's dead.  She feels his presence and...  She said that she has seances and she'll say, Ronnie, and he'll go... 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Yes, I pass gas.  Former First Lady Nancy Reagan said this week that President Barack Obama snubbed her and  that she still sees the ghost of her late husband inside her home.  Vanity Fair.  Obama missed an opportunity when she wasn't invited to a march ceremony where Obama said  he'd allow comprehensive stem cell research, but that the commander-in-chief later apologized  for the oversight. 
[03:09:30]  I wouldn't...  Boo.  Nancy.  What do you expect from a...  Of course, you're going to get snubbed.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  I would have gone and, you know, I don't like to travel, said Reagan87, a well-known  stem cell advocate.  Politically, it would have been a good thing for him to do.  Yes, but...  Oh, here comes the cranky old fuck getting ready for his shift. 
[03:10:00]  Ugh.  He's awful, isn't he?  Look how cranky this fucking guy is.  Watch the look he gives.  He does it every morning.  He doesn't have the balls to knock on that door and come in, though.  Watch the look.  Right about now, he stares, stares.  Today we get him shaking his head.  And then he looks right there before he goes.  See?  Ugh.  Ah, you kids.  Ugh. 
[03:10:30]  You meddling kids.  Get off my lawn.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ah.  I love when these people arrive for work.  It's great.  We missed a little Nicky today because we had Joe Frazier.  We couldn't interrupt the Joe Frazier interview.  No, we could have.  A little Nicky walk by.  A little Nicky.  Uh, it would have been a good thing.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, well, no one's perfect, she said.  Oh, especially not a...  Who knew I was so racist? 
[03:11:00]  Everyone.  Everyone.  Yes.  Uh, it isn't the first time Obama's insulted the first lady, the former first lady.  Uh, here's a quote from Obama.  Uh, I didn't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about, you know, doing any seances.  Obama joked on November 7th at a press conference.  Obama later apologized for his careless and offhanded remark. 
[03:11:30]  Boo.  Why do you have to apologize for everything?  Well, now I'm going to haunt the White House.  Yeah?  Yes, I'm going to be a spook.  A ghost in the White House.  I'm going to go around going, boo, I'm a spook.  Yes.  Yes.  That's what ghosts are.  Reagan spoke.  That's what ghosts are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Reagan, who spoke from her, her Bel Air, California home, also said she still catches glimpses of 
[03:12:00]  Ronald Reagan's ghost in the halls.  I wander the hallways looking for something.  My mind, I think.  Is it down here?  When you have Alzheimer's and, well, you die, you don't get to remember.  It doesn't all come back when you go to heaven.  You would think you would, though.  I asked God for a puppy. 
[03:12:30]  I thought I was three.  I miss Ronnie a lot, an awful lot, Reagan said.  People say it gets better.  No, it does not.  Yes, it does.  It got better for Ronnie.  Take your nagging.  It sounds strange, but I see Ronnie at nighttime.  If I wake up, I think Ronnie's there and I start to talk to him, she said.  It's not important what I say, but the fact is, I do think he's there and I see him.  It's my old coat on a coke rack, dummy. 
[03:13:00]  Well, she's always been into that spiritualist thing, right?  Seeing ghosts and fucking...  You don't believe in ghosts?  Seances.  I don't know what to believe.  I would like to think there are ghosts.  There are ghosts!  Ted, the ghost hunter!  Yes!  Ted, very scary. 
[03:13:30]  What's going on with Nancy Reagan?  She sees Ronald!  Yeah.  I'm a ghost.  He's very frightening.  Frightening.  Why is he frightening?  I don't know, because he haunts me.  Why does he haunt you, Ted?  I don't know.  He thinks I'm Nancy.  Why would he think that?  I don't know.  Maybe because I'm flat-chested.  Oh, God.  Fuck her.  She's in her 80s.  Ted hates that language. 
[03:14:00]  What else is going on?  She's going crazy.  That's nice to see.  Oh, the French Spider-Man is back in the news there.  Alan Robera.  I like this guy.  They call him the French Spider-Man.  Arrested after scaling a 41-story Sydney Tower in what?  Why don't you guess how long it took the French Spider-Man to scale 41 stories?  An hour?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Very interesting. 
[03:14:30]  Was it?  Uh-huh.  30 minutes.  25 minutes.  24, 23, 22, 21, 29, 28, 27, 28.  45 minutes.  What?  It lost me somewhere in there as you were getting closer.  Oh.  Ten minutes.  Give yourself a pill.  Did it really?  Give yourself a pill.  That's pretty fast.  I think that's pretty fucking fast.  Because he doesn't use shit, right?  Jimmy uses it.  He's the guy with the hands, and that's it?  Yeah.  Does he use, what does he use? 
[03:15:00]  A little powder?  A little rosin, I think, for his hands.  A rosin.  he's the one that just horrifies everybody  let him do his thing he obviously knows what he's doing  he hasn't fallen yet until he plummets  yeah that'll be his punishment  when he finally falls and then everyone  will say that he went doing what he loved  doing of course plummeting  while he screamed yeah yelling  screaming for 40 some  odd stories for that big impact  mm-hmm  it's gotta hurt when you hit your head and it hurts  like when you go  fuck you hit your head 
[03:15:30]  just imagine for that split second before you actually  croak like that's really gotta be  a bam smack  probably doesn't hurt  I bet it does for a second  I bet everything does for that split second  but I don't think it registers in time for you to realize  how much it hurt I bet it does  you think yeah I bet  alright I don't know  Robert  how does a car lose all four wheels on a  highway at the same time  what man this person  somebody hated this person 
[03:16:00]  that sounds like a  inside job  this is out of Zurich  a car traveling on a motorway in Switzerland  lost all four wheels simultaneously  coming to an immediate halt in the middle of the highway  the car had  just stopped and the passengers had changed  from winter to summer wheels  themselves  a common task in Switzerland  they change out their wheels in Switzerland  Switzerland  it's gotta be like snowy  yeah I understand they got a lot of snow  so they put the summer wheels on 
[03:16:30]  didn't tighten the lugs  used the wrong nuts  when mounting the new set of tires  when  when  when they then drove back onto the motorway  all the wheels disconnected  holy shit  luckily no one was injured  and no other vehicle was damaged  that's pretty amazing  it's probably best that all your wheels fall off  there's like two left  you're gonna roll off to one side  yeah that wouldn't be good  all four come off  you just skid  you go ah  come to a stop  that was fun  that was cool  funny games  yeah I remember snow tires 
[03:17:00]  I used to use them like just as tires  I was a broke ass motherfucker  I'd have those tires with the studs on them  and just rip up the gravel  you'd have the studded tires  and you'd be driving  and sparks would come off your wheels  yeah they don't really  they don't really have those anymore right  no  they just got an all purpose tire  I think  for most parts of the country  yeah  and then you use what  a little chains every once in a while  yeah  what'd they find the plane crash  oh we found the plane crash  a little google mapping  are there pictures of it  no  not yet  on google 
[03:17:30]  google  just uh  that some debris was found  an airplane seat life jacket  and some metallic debris  and signs of fuel  metallic what  metallic debris  found in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean  blah blah blah  debris was spotted  uh  about 410 miles  yep  north of the Brazilian island  of Fernando de Noronha  how amazing is it  that they found one alive  that is just like  the most incredible story  in the last 10 years  crazy  did I take a picture of the debris  Jesus 
[03:18:00]  this is the scale  you can figure it was probably  that's not the scale  is that the island  that would be the biggest hand ever  if that was to scale  you know what I mean  using their scale on the bottom  that's uh  that was a good cursor joke  when was the last time  you had a good cursor joke  three days ago  really  yeah  uh  what's Ozzy saying Jimmy  released a statement  on Tony Iommi's lawsuit  did not hear that  is this a new  statement 
[03:18:30]  must be  I have not heard  any statements from Oz  what did he say  I don't know  I'm asking you  you're the Ozzy guy  but no one told me anything  you're all Ozzy  all the time  my friend  I don't  uh  let me see  is there a new statement  or is this an old statement  and we have to change up  the prep sheet  last week the news broke  it uh  oh here's the statement  wow it's a long one  it's a lot of reading  I don't know if we want to get  into a lot of reading Jimmy  I'll explain it  if it's Ozzy  alright  um  it is with great regret  that I had to resort 
[03:19:00]  to legal action  against my long time partner  Tony Iommi  but after three years  of trying  to resolve this issue  amicably  I feel that no other recourse  reads a statement  from Ozzy  as of the  I'll do that part for you  as of  okay  as of the mid-1990s  after constant  numerous changes  in band members  the brand of Black Sabbath  was literally 
[03:19:30]  in the toilet  and Tony Iommi  touring under  the new name  Black Sabbath  was reduced  to performing  in clubs  oh damn  since 1997  when Giza, Bill and myself  rejoined the band  Black Sabbath  has returned  to its former glory  as we headline  sold out arenas  and amphitheaters  playing to upwards  of 50,000 people  at each show  around the world  I wonder who worded this 
[03:20:00]  because I didn't  we worked collectively  to restore credibility  and bring dignity back  dignity  to the name  Black Sabbath  which led to the band  being inducted  into the UK  and US  Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  in which Jim Norton  asked some very  poignant questions  in 2005  and 2006  that doesn't say that  respectively  I see it  it's right there  throughout the last  12 years  it was my management  representatives  who oversaw  the marketing  and quality control 
[03:20:30]  of the Black Sabbath  brand  through Ozfest  touring merchandising  and album reissues  he did  you're absolutely right  this is not Ozzy  it doesn't  it doesn't  it's not written  like Ozzy would say  this shit  the name Black Sabbath  now has a worldwide  prestige  and merchandising value  I've never said  those words  in my life  look at this  PowerPoint presentation  that it would not 
[03:21:00]  have had  by continuing  on the road  it was on  prior to the  1997 reunion tour  then Ozzy  addressed I owe me  personally by saying  Tony I am so sorry  it had to get  to this point  by me having to  take this action  against you  I don't have the right  to speak for  Geezer and Bill  but I feel that  morally and ethically  the trademark  should be owned  by the four of us  equally  I hope that  by taking this  first step  that it will  ultimately  end up that way  we've all worked 
[03:21:30]  too hard  and long  in our career  to allow you  to sell merchandise  that features  all of our faces  our Black Sabbath  album covers  and bad logos  and then you tell us  that you own  the copyright  we're all in our  60s now  the Black Sabbath  legacy  should live on  long after  we are all gone  please do the right  thing  what happened  it sounds a little 
[03:22:00]  it's Ted Osborne  it's Ted Osborne  Ted Osborne  Ted Osborne  how annoying  was that for  everyone listening  my apologies  fantastic  I'm getting into it  it really made  the statement  I only want to  talk like this  for the rest of the  day  it made the statement  a lot easier  to listen to  sure it did  hello Jim  your producer  is a faggot  how did your 
[03:22:30]  trademark die  wow so he's  well somebody's  mad  a lawyer  or Sharon  well you know  what  who wrote that  the bottom line  is that they  should all four  own it  I mean  yeah he's not  even saying  anyone should  at this point  he should just  take the name  what's the problem  they should all  own it  it should be  10 10 10  10 and 70  if Tony took  the initiative  now Ozzy  should try to  get the whole  damn thing  himself  right  screw the rest  of the guys  or at least  Tony  take his share 
[03:23:00]  a little  little po-fa  a po-fa  yeah we got a  po-fa  that happened  on TV  next you're  enjoying that  Dixieland  music  aren't you  all right  it feels like  one of those  old Albert  and Costello  kind of movies  or something  exactly  so is the  weather anything  to dance about  well I'm going  to sort of  sashay over to  the chroma key  wall here  and we'll show 
[03:23:30]  you exactly  maybe a better  back step  yeah I made a  better back stroke  with the rain  that we're going  to have in our  forecast here  yeah you know  she said  Albert and  Costello  what a bunch  of shit  oh she did  Albert and  Costello  what's wrong  with that  Albert and  Costello  that's not a  bad one  it's terrible  how does she  not know the  name Abbott and  Costello  she fucked up  that's all  Laurel and  Hardly  who's Laura  and Hardy  oh man 
[03:24:00]  Travis had  what happened  well Travis  had told me  he went on  a little trip  to Voss's  house  oh yeah  why is he  going to  Voss's house  I don't know  something was  going on  no he gave  us a bunch  of baby  stuff  oh baby  stuff  because he's  soon to be  his shoes  he's very anxious  to get rid of  everything he has  his personal  collection  yeah  yeah so  your description 
[03:24:30]  I curse you  for not taking  pictures  yeah I  really shouldn't  have brought it  up without  pictures but  yeah  Jim have you  been to his  house  I have not  I was taking  pictures  I've heard  I have been  there  okay  so I can  back up  what Travis  I could even  write down  what Travis  is about to  say  me and  Travis  didn't even  have this  conversation  no we  didn't  I know  exactly where  you're going  with this  and I'll  back you  up  go ahead  Travis  boss's  living room  looks like  a grandmother's  living room  ring the bell 
[03:25:00]  that's what I  was going to  say  he's got all  antiques in  his fucking  house  no but  they're not  antiques  he bought  them from  an estate  garage sale  yeah they're  like they're  antiques  technically  they're just  old people's  furniture  they're like  paintings you  get from  the Marriott  when they  say we're  selling all  the paintings  here at the  Marriott hotel  and you get  like these  awful paintings  yeah he's got  three paintings  that are just  haphazardly  hung  one is of  a ship  it's a ship 
[03:25:30]  that's what he'll  be doing to  gigs for the  rest of his  career  what a  fucking  jerk  one is like  two old  ladies  going one  way  one  and a  turtle handed  idiot in the  middle going  what do you  want from me  the dogs are  playing poker  yeah that  one  you ever see  this one  before  how clever  it is  and they're  in those  terrible  gold  gaudy  frames  oh yeah  big  big  frames  gold  leaf  and those  are all  hanging 
[03:26:00]  above  his  huge  old lady  couch  it's like  a  burgundy  color  I guess  of course  and it takes  up about  three quarters  of his  living room  did you see  his memorabilia  section  when you first  walk in  you mean  the stuff  that's  hanging  when you first  walk in  he's got  stuff  hanging  yeah  but it's  should be  him  it's so  it's so  shoddy  it's like  it's like  he took a  polaroid picture  of like a  computer screen  of him  on a stage  somewhere  it's horrendous 
[03:26:30]  how bad  this stuff  is  and he  doesn't  really hang  things like  with any  purpose  it seems  like he  just closed  his eyes  and just  put a nail  in the  wall  and just  decided  that that's  where he's  gonna hang  it  yeah  he's got  like a  montage  of pictures  of him  being famous  and what  about  his  television  set  his  tube  TV  is this  a tube  TV  well he's  got one of  those  remember  like maybe  five years  ago  they put  out those  flat screen  tube TVs  like  they were 
[03:27:00]  still huge  it looks  like a  flat screen  from the  front  yeah  yeah  that's  all it  is  it's  just  the  front  it's  got  like  a  little  thin  border  of  something  around  it  and  it's  flat  but  then you  go  around  the  side  and realize  it's  8 feet  wide  it's  still  too  deep  to  put  anywhere  near  those  it's  terrible  you can't  really hang  it on  a wall  why  wouldn't  so when  we all  go  digital  they're  talking  about  Voss  right  Voss  has to  like  worry  about 
[03:27:30]  the  converter  boxes  and  stuff  yeah  Voss  I'm sure  he still  uses  antenna  to watch  TV  why  would I  pay  the TV  works  perfectly  and of  course  his  desktop  computer  is in  his  kitchen  why  I don't  know  because he's  an idiot  it's the worst  house I've ever  seen  that's funny  Voss  gives him  baby stuff  I know  he was so  sweet  he gave us  so much  stuff  but we're  gonna have  to go

[03:31:00]  but now  you're telling  me one of  the kids  got a million  dollars even  though he  was the one  that provoked  the whole  fucking thing  yeah both  him and his  brothers they  were supposedly  drunk when  they were doing  it and they  were firing  batteries at  the tigers to  get them to  react  that'll do it  is this true  Dan  yeah it sure  is they're  gonna get  900 grand  what  and it says  the brother  sued the zoo  last november  the lawsuit  claimed the  men's civil  rights were  violated and  accused the  zoo of  negligence for  not building 
[03:31:30]  a moat big  enough that  the tiger  couldn't  escape  so we  should be  allowed to  throw batteries  at it  we should  allow kids  to throw  batteries at  tigers  without the  tiger getting  out and  attacking us  for being pissed  off because it  got hit by a  battery  the lawsuit  also accused  Singer who  is the  spokesperson for  the zoo  they accused  him of libel  and slander for  suggesting the  men might have  been taunting  the cat  what else do  you do with  a battery  throwing at a  cat  maybe they  weren't  were they

[03:33:30]  while the other  contains blue  syrup  it's pretty hard  to tell which  is which  the two bottles  are the exact  same shape  size and color  and it's those  similarities that  confused a new  zoo employee who  accidentally grabbed  a bottle of the  blue cleaner  when told to get  more syrup bottles  to fill the snow  cone machine  the garage  several of the  tainted snow  cones were sold  to people  including this  woman  and they took  bites and we  noticed they  didn't taste the  same and so i  tasted it i thought  maybe the utensils  were dirty and then  someone ran up to us 
[03:34:00]  and told us that it  was degreaser on top  of the blue snow  cone instead of the  blue syrup  the people who ate the  snow cone spit them  out immediately and  went to the emergency  room as a precaution  be careful and pay  attention to what you're  grabbing  what it does it could  have turned tragic  zoo officials say  they're very sorry  about the mix up  could have turned  tragic if you kept  eating something that  didn't taste good  right it just tastes  like bad butter  that was grease  the best part about  that uh that woman  that was talking who  had gotten one of  these tainted snow  cones uh they shot 
[03:34:30]  her shadow because  she was a big fat  person and didn't  want to be on the  news about a snow  cone story yeah  so they just shot  her not even in  silhouette but just  her shadow on the  floor and so you  could tell she was a  big mess great big  fat person big pig  having a snow cone  would you be able to  tell right away before  you even chomp it to  the snow cone that  something didn't look  right yeah something's  amiss you knew it  wouldn't be a salad  mishap  uh the great joe

[03:39:30]  well tisha the marion county  coroner's office has  characterized the situation  as both unusual and  delicate but in fact  the chief deputy  coroner here insists  that the office acted  in the best interest  of the victim's family  you be the judge  all right  48 year old  theresa smith  lived a solitary  reclusive life  the handling of her death  has become a public  embarrassment for the  coroner's office  it should have been  handled a little different  you know i mean  because putting on  a flatbed truck  like they did 
[03:40:00]  that was that was  like putting a cow  up there  exactly  smith weighed  750 pounds  ah  we're not even  talking about a lady  that's you know  look  300 pounds  something has to be  done  400 pounds  five  we're talking about  a 700 pound woman  when a behemoth dies  what the fuck  did you want  you can't just  throw it in the  back of an ambulance  and have it doing  a wheelie  all the way to  the coroner's office  look at the size  750 pounds  and the deputy  coroner who  attended her death 
[03:40:30]  called a towing  service to remove  the body  it's like they  kind of hauled  off like trash  you know  it's like they  didn't have  respect for her  body  and kind of  just told her  away like she  was a  like a lemon  she didn't  respect her body  thank you jimmy  you beat me  by a second  she didn't  respect her own  body  what do you  what do you  want from these  people  what do you  what do you  want  they could have  cut her in half  and put her in  two ambulances  treated her like the  slob  she was  right  exactly  what the fuck  were they supposed  to do  for real 
[03:41:00]  that would be  funny  cut her in pieces  right in front  of the family  with a chainsaw  stand back  should have left  her in the house  and let her rot  for a while  until she dropped  four or five hundred pounds  from rotting  and then maybe get her  in an ambulance  a bambulance  well I need a bambulance  and then  this part might have  been a little rough  this next part  this is the part  of the story  I might agree with  they put the spare  in her hiney hole  so far  I don't agree  but this part  got a little 
[03:41:30]  ugly  many of Smith's  neighbors  watched the record  driver  winch the victim's  mattress to a cable  and drag it  into the courtyard  what really got me  is when they  took her off  onto the flatbed  they threw this  dirty carpet  on top of her  once on board  they strapped the body  to the record  and gave Smith  a police escort  to the morgue  we escorted her  we escorted her  downtown  with two police  cars  and myself 
[03:42:00]  and coroner  just in case  something went  wrong  where she  was uncovered  throughout the entire  ordeal  David Johnson  and his 13 year old  son watched  from a distance  grief stricken  and at the same  time disbelieving  if there was  any other way  they could have  took her out of there  I wish they would  have done it that way  instead of having  to move her out  on a giant  um  helicopter  when they scoop up  dead dogs off the street  they don't treat them  that way  oh shut up  there's no 750 pound 
[03:42:30]  dogs dying on the street  dummy  if a cow died  what do you think  they'd do  they'd get a fucking  same rig  oh stop  what do you think  if one did  yeah  it did  jeez  did they really  use a winch  to get her out of there  what are they going  to do  pick her up  all that fat  big smelly body  what are they  tied to the mattress  and then winched  the whole thing out  yeah  who wouldn't want  to see that  I know  like a circus act  I would have laughed  until my fucking  throat hurt  watching that fat 
[03:43:00]  fucking spectacle  be pulled out  by machinery  spectacle  let's see  yeah let's go to  Chad in Canada  Chad  hey how you doing  Chad  hey listen  usually when we  shoot a moose  in Canada  we gotta quarter it  before we can drag it  out of the bush  yeah they're pretty  bad  yeah  so they could've  quartered her  it could've been worse  Oscar in Ohio  yeah hey I live  in Marion County  yeah they actually 
[03:43:30]  tied the wind cable  to her and drug her  up on the flatbed  like you do a car  that's ridiculous  well I mean  I'm sure her body  wasn't scraping  on the pavement  no  she was still  on the mattress  part  like the tone  of the yard  where they keep  your car  when you  you park  illegally  yeah I see  no problem  with what they  did  you can claim  your pig  at Pier 61  whatever it is  what was their  option  what are they  saying they  should've done  what's the option  there 
[03:44:00]  with more dignity  how  not cover her  with an old  piece of carpet  let her lay there  and just form  a new La Brea  tar pit  fucking big fatso  dumb family  just throwing  food at her  Larry the trucker  Larry  yes sir  they wouldn't  have got so mad  if they had to  stuck a wide load  sticker on her ass  and put flags  on her hips  that's very dangerous  though  wide load  driving down the street  some trucking  humor for everybody  I like it Larry  Larry rules  alright  they want a skydiver 
[03:44:30]  to come down  so the parachute  could cover her gently  she needed to be  covered  maybe they could  or just  nothing  just like  yeah leave nothing  maybe they could  use the sheet  instead of the rug  a sheet probably  wouldn't cover her  you don't think  probably not  that's crazy  750 pounds  that'd just be  oozing fat  oh  uh blue healer  you're right  I guess god  needed a fat  fucking woman  god needed a new
