<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts joking about their controversial past. They then morbidly discussed Aretha Franklin's pancreatic cancer diagnosis, followed by a discussion of the death of Opie's ophthalmologist, Dr. Philitoff, and a surprising call Opie received from Lisa Orban regarding the wake.  A substantial portion of the show analyzed Oprah Winfrey's denial of being gay in a Barbara Walters interview, with the hosts engaging in crude sexual innuendo while speculating about Oprah's sexuality and relationship with Gayle.  Opie then recounted his visit to Strawberry Fields on the anniversary of John Lennon's death, sharing video clips of his encounters, including a rambling letter left at the Imagine mosaic, which the hosts mocked.  News about Howard Stern's Sirius XM re-signing and the planned renaming of NYC bridges and tunnels, which the hosts ridiculed, were also discussed.  The segment concluded with the playing of a previously unaired, candid Rolling Stone interview with John Lennon.

The next segment started with a tirade against the MTA, using highly offensive language to describe its poor service and financial mismanagement. This transitioned into a discussion of the dangers of the Lincoln Tunnel, focusing on a recent bus crash, and a rant about the city's plans for lowercase street signs.  A lengthy anecdote about one host's experiences with union labor followed.  The conversation then shifted to Snooki's Times Square New Year's Eve appearance, leading to further vulgar commentary.  A discussion about unreadable fonts preceded a musical segment featuring the band Mando Birch, with Dr. Steve on vocals, performing a David Bowie cover.  Dr. Steve later called in, discussing the band's history and lack of success.  The segment concluded with more commentary on Mando Birch and Yes.  Offensive language and crude jokes were prevalent throughout.

The following segment started with a vulgar discussion about keywords associated with a specific music genre, followed by crude speculation about unicorns defecating on airplanes.  A call with Ian Halpern dominated this portion. Halpern, introducing himself with nonsensical phrases, promoted his movie "Small Town Chinese Pussy" and made hyperbolic claims about Gansu, China, having the highest per capita virgin population, leading to numerous sexually explicit jokes.  He also offered (already known and unsubstantiated) breaking news about Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey, claiming Oprah faked tears and alleging Elizabeth Edwards had a young male lover. He also commented on Barack Obama and Jennifer Lopez.  His claims were met with skepticism. The segment concluded with a conversation with John Stagliano ("Buttman"), a pornographer facing obscenity charges, discussing the legal battles within the adult film industry, focusing on his own case involving "Milk Nymphos," the absurdity of obscenity laws, and the impact of the internet.

A final segment featured a continued discussion with John Stagliano about his obscenity trial for films like "Milk Nymphos" and "Storm Squirters 2: Target Practice." He detailed the trial's inconsistencies, the prosecutor's alleged lies, and the FBI's role. He argued for adults' right to consume such material and contrasted his work with that of Max Hardcore, emphasizing his avoidance of misogynistic themes.  The discussion covered the vagueness of obscenity laws, comparing his case to Larry Flynt's and criticizing the lack of ACLU support. Stagliano discussed the financials of the adult film industry, mentioning figures like Sasha Grey and Jenna Jameson, and the subjectivity of obscenity laws, using "Two Girls, One Cup" as an example.  The segment ended with humorous anecdotes and banter.

Yeah, did you hear her say that? 
[00:05:00]  They don't really have any  They don't really have any info that comes out  But I mean  That means she just doesn't like sex though  You think she's asexual?  Yeah, I think she's one of those guys  A little asexual action  Those guys  I don't know  Because I mean  Gail is her friend  She likes hanging out with her a lot  Because she doesn't really like  Hanging out with this Stedman guy  They're never around together  Because the way she described it yesterday  Or the way I saw  I got it  Oh, you got it  Okay  Why don't we play it real fast?  I didn't know we were going down this road  Which is fine  It really 
[00:05:30]  It's almost like  If she's lying  I don't lie  She's really made a liar out of herself  That's why I think she's actually telling the truth  All right  Here's  What is this?

[00:06:30]  She spines  Huh?  She spines  Oh, it is  A lot of women have close friends  Very few have friends as close as yours  Mm-hmm  Describe that friendship to me  Whew, okay  Uh  Ding-dong, ring-ding, yodel, and speak  Coffee cake  She is  The mother I never had  What?  She is 
[00:07:00]  That got to you  That got to old you right there  That got to  I can understand  Oh, that's sad  I need a gal  I need a gal  Oh, get over it  True  A mother or a billion dollars  I'll take the billion  I would take the billion dollars  Every time in that scenario  Yes  Oh, you have to  She's a billionaire  She's a billionaire  I'm sick of feeling sorry for people that are billionaires 
[00:07:30]  She's the mother  That, uh  She never had  What happened?  Dude, would you trade your mother in for a billion dollars?  And you love your mommy  Yes, especially now  Especially now  I guilt my mother into trading herself in for my billion  Oh my god  What's wrong with these people?  I'll help you, Anthony  We can split it  Alright, Sal  There's only one person in your life  Bro, get in the car  We're taking a drive to the country  Right  Then you let her out of the car and just speed away 
[00:08:00]  Yeah  Get your billion bucks  Oprah's got houses all over the world  Yeah  Who needs a mommy?  She needs her mommy  The mother I never had  She is the sister  Everybody would want  She is the friend  That everybody deserves  She's everything  She's everything, yeah  I'm sure  I don't know a better person  And she licks a box like no one's fucking business 
[00:08:30]  I don't know a better person  Why is it making you cry?  Shoot  I wasn't going to cry here  That's what everyone says  It's making me cry because I'm thinking about  How much  I probably have never told her that  She knows now  Tissue please  I now need tissue  I've never told her that  Oh boy  Well, now you did on a TV show 
[00:09:00]  In front of everybody  Right  Instead of pulling her aside in private  Right  I don't know why  Maybe because in private  It would always sound like this  You are the mother of the  I never had  I don't know why celebrities have to reveal so much  Yeah  To Barbara  Yeah, to the media  Why are you crying?  Right  Supposed to run this show? 
[00:09:30]  Well, then that led to the lesbian thing  So let's take a listen here  So when those  To me  Dumb rumors come up  That you  Are gay  Are gay  Uh-huh  What do you say?  Well, I have said  We are not gay  Enough times  I'm not lesbian  I'm not even  Kind of lesbian  Not that there's anything wrong with that  Because the reason why it irritates me  Is because  It means that  Somebody must think I'm lying  That's number one 
[00:10:00]  Number two  Why would you want to hide it?  That is not the way I run my life  There you go  And why do you believe that, Jimmy?  It's just when she said  I am not even  Like I'm not even kind of lesbian  It sounded like the denial of a person who isn't  That sounds like thou protesteth too much  When you say I'm not even like me  Because like  I think all girls  Especially when they have their close girlfriends  A couple of glasses of wine  They look at each other  They think  Maybe  They kiss 
[00:10:30]  They hug a lot more  Than a guy ever would  Yeah, but they wouldn't say that's a lesbo  Right  I do  That's just a fun Saturday night  She almost said lesbo  It sounds like  Yeah  She's a lesbo-bian  Lesbo-bian  She's a lesbo-bian  So  That's big news today, man  I don't think everybody's going to buy it  Huh?  I don't think everybody  I don't think she convinced that  She's trying to throw everyone off the scent  Off the scent  Off the pussy scent  The scent on her fingers  Smell my fingers  Smell them  I'll prove it 
[00:11:00]  Smell my fingers  So there you go  I guess there'll be more to that interview coming up  When is that air?  Does anybody know?  Tonight  Tonight  You can check out the Oprah Winfrey interview with Barbara Walters tonight  That gal must just be able to hit her up for cash all the time  Like, Oprah, could I have a million?  She'll be like, oh, okay  I think her numbers just went up  If she's Oprah's mommy  Yeah  I think she just made a few mil off that  Oprah, I'm going out  Could I have like, you know, 600,000?  Because I really want to go out to a nice dinner 
[00:11:30]  Yeah  Oh yeah, it's on the night table  Why the fuck can't I have a billionaire friend?  I don't know  That would be cool, right?  Yeah  You wouldn't have to do anything  Reach that billionaire mark  You're fucking done  Yep  Then you've got to be charitable  Really?  Yeah, it's pretty much the law  If you're a billionaire and you're not charitable  Then you're one of those scumbag, you know  Yeah, but if you're a billionaire  Why would you care if people think you're a scumbag?  That's true  Yeah  You've got to be like Bill Gates  I want to give a million dollars to AIDS in Africa 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, but that's like a dollar to me and you  That's nothing, I know  That's nothing to him  He's not that good of a guy  He's handing out a few dollars here and there  He like made  Comparatively speaking  He like made one of the first like I think million dollar charity contributions or something  And a lot of other people are following suit  Or billion dollars it might have even been  What a waste of money though  Because I walk around this world  I haven't seen anything change  No, it was to give people AIDS in Africa  Oh  It was, yeah, everybody thought he was a good guy 
[00:12:30]  But it was for AIDS in Africa  And everybody's like, oh, that's cool  And then, but he's handing out syringes with AIDS in it  Oh  And injecting everybody  He just wanted to move the process along  Yeah, yeah, get along quicker  So you could open up some Microsoft factories down there on cheap property  Hey, shut up  No, I can't do that  So yesterday  Turn my ringer off  I decided to hang out with the hippies  Man  Man  Yesterday was the  With Dr. Steve's band  Well, we're going to get to that too, man 
[00:13:00]  We got a very busy show today  Yeah  I decided to go to Strawberry Fields for the 30th anniversary of the death of John Lennon  You kidding?  And boy, did I take it all in yesterday  Yeah, did you soak it in?  I soaked it in  What did you feel?  Well, the first thing I came across when I got there  Did you feel the love?  Hell no, man  Oh, right  A lot of fucking hippies trying to get as close as they can to the Imagine Mosaic  Oh, you couldn't get near it?  Oh, I was sitting pretty much on the Imagine Mosaic  Sacred ground  That's the  Hallowed ground  That's the beauty of me  And then people were getting really mad that I stayed there for a couple hours 
[00:13:30]  I should have stayed there for a little while and let others sit  And let others take their pictures  I'm like, leave me alone  Did you look like you were reflecting?  Or were you just sitting there like  Hey, look at me, I'm sitting  It was, hey, look at me, I'm sitting  Oh, because everybody else would sit there and cry or reflect  One lady's like  And he's not even looking  He's texting  So I turn around and go  I'm fucking tweeting  I got in a fight with a lady  John would have wanted it that way 
[00:14:00]  I got in a fight  She's mad because I'm in the way of her picture of the Imagine logo  With all the flowers and green apples and album covers and love notes to John Lennon  It's beautiful  That the fact that people are so easy to piss off at a moment like that in a place  Where they're coming  And it's supposedly to be for love and peace and remembering John  But if they can't get their fucking picture  Right  They'll start yelling  Right  Like you're stuck in traffic 
[00:14:30]  Right  I shot about an hour of video  I put up a couple videos  But then the next thing I noticed is I was able to sit pretty much on the Imagine logo  I got yelled at because my feet were on the flowers  The roses that people are laying down  Where do you think those are going?  At one point a candle fell over and was burning everything  Nice  And then the mayor of the Imagine Mosaic was yelling at everybody  What's his problem?  This is supposed to be a fucking love and peace thing  Yeah  He's yelling because one of the guitar players had his guitar case just willy-nilly on all the shit that was left for John Lennon 
[00:15:00]  Like on the Mosaic?  Yeah  I haven't posted that video yet  But there was a big fucking argument going on  So what was his problem with that?  He's like  I told you yesterday  He's the mayor of Strawberry Field  Self-appointed  Self-appointed  And every day he puts some kind of peace sign on the Imagine logo  Whether it's in bagels, pot leaves, flowers  Sometimes he'll just get a whole bunch of green apples  God  And he was yelling 
[00:15:30]  About 38 shells  That would be really ironic  But he was yelling to the crowd  He's like  Look people  Everyone needs to take a step back  This is a big day for me  I'm very stressed out  Because usually it's just, you know  A few people here and there  Visiting  He's stressed out  Like he makes the day about him  Yes  It has nothing to do with any of these fuckos that go down there  He goes  Please people  Please  It's a very busy day  So then 
[00:16:00]  Oh, the next thing I saw before I sat down  I forgot  And I thought of Anthony actually  There's a guy  That's trying to sell the fact that  The CIA killed John Lennon  And I got him on video  And he's down there too?  Yes  Preaching  You want to hear  What he has to say about the death of John Lennon  Please  Please  I want to hear this  Huge sign  Drivel  Yeah, go ahead  It wasn't the CIA  It was the  MDC  Huh? 
[00:16:30]  Wow  Mark David Chapman  No, Mark David Chapman was hired by the CIA  I was like  Sorry, I was looking for a joke  Yeah  Oh  No, no, no  I just threw out letters  Let me throw out three more  B-O-O  No, it's on my YouTube channel there, Danny  I'm sorry, I should have told you  The MDC, was it?  Wow  I was thinking some kind of racist stuff for Yoko  But  Yeah 
[00:17:00]  All right  Let's all take a breath and recover from that  Oh, Jimmy  It's  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Here's  And this is CIA guy  Yeah, maybe  Maybe Jesse Ventura could do a conspiracy thing  Okay, hold on  Hold on  Hold on  He's  Let me  Set the scene  He's absolutely kooky looking  He's got a giant like sandwich board thing on him  That says CIA  Killed  In red letters, of course  Lennon 
[00:17:30]  Right  And he's got all kinds of literature in his hands  In his gloved hands  And he's chatting with people, I guess  Correct  About his theory  Yeah, he's got his book he's trying to sell  That looks like he has maybe five copies that he made  Yeah  And then, yeah, little flyers with the basic info on how CIA killed Lennon  Yeah, yeah  Leary's book is bigger  Leary's book is bigger than that fucking thing  So I said, fuck, I gotta talk to this guy for a second  So I walked up to him  I sit in the middle and suddenly you're in their universe  Interesting 
[00:18:00]  Well, I've got it stuffed in one of my pockets  I'm gonna read it  How did this happen?  What happened?  CIA killed Lennon  You're welcome  Take care  They killed him because of Central America  They were launching their wars against Nicaragua and El Salvador  Right at that moment  And Lennon was seen as the one person who could galvanize a million people  Into the movement  So he had to be a little bit  Mark David Chapman was in close proximity with the CIA  In 1975  That's part of the public group 
[00:18:30]  Wait, did Mark David Chapman have something to do with it?  He was programmed  What do you mean he was programmed?  He was hitting it under their MKUlticur  You just walk away from him  That's the equivalent of the hang-up  Yeah, yeah, on video  On video  That's the equivalent of that  I like how you still hear him babbling as you're just walking away from him  What an asshole  Mark David Chapman was close to the CIA in 75  How close was he?  Did he live near them?  What was he even talking about? 
[00:19:00]  What I learned about the conspiracy guy yesterday  You have to speak very calmly  And very confidently  And then whatever you're saying is real  Yeah  Didn't that sound very real?  What it is is  Is it?  Right?  Yeah  CIA  Mark David Chapman  Maybe Jesse Ventura could do a little thing on  I don't think so  I don't even believe this asshole  No  Conspiracy  This man's a filthy hippie  I bet he never served  What an ass 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, he was an ass  The place was filled with assholes  I'd love to know the background on that though  Like where he gets it  And how much of that is just utter and complete bullshit  A fucking uber fan  Right  With his jealousy  With his jealousy and his feelings of inadequacy  Goes up and shoots John Lennon  Yep  And then this guy's got to say  Bring in a fucking Oswald CIA connection thing  It's just  Well, doesn't it all start with one little tidbit, you think? 
[00:20:00]  One little weird thing  I'm sure  Not an actual fact  But some little weird thing that pops up  And then they just run with it, right?  I'm sure we can all somehow  Be weirdly  Like six degrees of separation  Connected to somebody  In intelligence  The CIA  Oh, do you know  This person actually knew  His brother  Met with this guy  Who it turns out 
[00:20:30]  Was a CIA agent  And you're like  Well  And?  Right  You know  They walk around  They don't lock them in lockers at night  You know  You're going to meet people  From different jobs  Police officers  That are in  Anti-terrorism  But they make it like  It's so like  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  Look at that  He knows more people  Than just people that work  At a gas station  Sure  Yeah  So they take that  And spin it into this big  Hot wind  Hot wind  As I call it  Enough info for a book 
[00:21:00]  That guy had a book on it  Leary's got one too  It's really  Just a few pages long  And there's probably a lot of pictures  Of John Lennon  Yeah  Then  Then I moved on  To the actual  Imagine Mosaic  Where I saw the mayor  You know  Fighting with the guy  Fighting with the guy  Even though it was a peace love day  You know  Peace love  First of all  Lennon like played guitar  Right  And this other guy's guitar case  Was infringing on the mayor's area  Yeah  And he gets mad at that  Yeah  It's a day that's supposed to commemorate  The love that was John Lennon 
[00:21:30]  Well yeah  And it's a guitar case  So it fits in  It's like  And this fucking self-serving ass cock  Yeah  Is out there yelling at him  Because his guitar case is on there  He said man  I'm stressed out  There's a lot going on today  It's about me  I bet when he got dressed  A lot going on today  He gets in front of a full-length mirror  And has a little talk with himself  About how it's his day  And he's going out there  And then he probably gives himself a  And points his fingers at the mirror  Yeah  Because yeah you got it  Yeah  Now let's go get him  Yeah  He's in the paper today  If you want to see what he looks like 
[00:22:00]  Fortunately not for other reasons  No  So then I squeezed my way  I said fuck it  And I was ground zero at the Mosaic  There were thousands of people behind me  Thousands  It got so fucking crowded  And all of a sudden  Somebody squeezes through the crowd  And just drops a letter  On the Mosaic  And I tweeted it in four parts  We gotta read the letter today on the air  The letter is  Jimmy  I will love the letter  Babel  Who wrote it?  It is  Just a fan  A girl named Madeline 
[00:22:30]  Madeline  To John  Of course  Yeah there's the letter  I don't think he'll be picking it up anytime soon  To tell you the truth  Who wants to read this?  Oh we don't  We can't get it  Let me see  This is for  This is for John Lennon  On the 30th anniversary of his death  That was left at  The Imagine Mosaic  Dear John  Could you point out all the  All the grammar errors  While you  Really?  While you read this  Yes  Your music inspires me so much  And when I read about it  First of all  Let me say  There's a comma after dear 
[00:23:00]  Right  Right after John  Dear  And then  She didn't go down the line  And did not indent  I think John Lennon  Would be very  And the Y  And your  Isn't capitalized  Because  She starts off  With John  Your music  It should be  Dear John  Right  Your music  With a capital Y  Right  Your  Right  Exactly  It's dear  Comma  I didn't even notice that one  Imagine there's no grammar  You can in this letter  Yes 
[00:23:30]  Yeah that's  So that's just the first fucking  Three, four words  I'll read it  But who am I to say  Dear  John  Your music  Your music inspires me  That's exactly how it's written  That's how it's supposed to be read  So much  And when I read about how happy you and Yoko were  It makes me feel happy  You and Yoko were the perfect pair  Just trying to have  You and Yoko  Wear the perfect pair  Oh 
[00:24:00]  Wear the perfect pair  That's another problem the guy had  Location  Not we are  Right  Just trying to  Have change for the world  That is  A very hard thing to do  It is so inspiring  How many people  You did change  Because when you had power over people who loved you  You used it  People say your wife broke up the Beatles  I don't think so  I don't think so  When I've heard that  Paul got mad  That's sorry  I couldn't get the whole letter in one tweet 
[00:24:30]  Until we go to part two  Part two  This is such drivel from a lunatic  This sounds like a letter  That would be written right before you shot John Lennon  Yeah  If he was still alive  How about you just think this  And don't write it down  Right  And how about you use a period every once in a while  Period  Paul got mad because  When I heard Paul got mad  She was coming to recordings  I thought that Yoko  Just wanted to learn about the Beatles  And be there  To experience a great thing  I love your bed  In for peace 
[00:25:00]  Yes you did  For Yoko and you  It is wonderful how you  And Yoko met  Why can't we explain that  Jimmy reads these letters literally  It's the funniest thing  That was a scratch out word  It's a scratch out of the word and  And then the very next word is and  And these letters are much bigger  These are getting bigger and bolder  Yes  Someone's getting a little confident  Because their pillows are wearing off  It is wonderful how you and 
[00:25:30]  Yoko met  Yoko met  I wish you were  Still here with us  On earth  Another page  Sorry  Okay  I want to make sure people can read this  Oh  Whenever anyone says anything bad about you  Yoko  Paul  Ringo  Or George  I always say  How nice of a person  Every one of you are  Except me 
[00:26:00]  No  Anyone  Of you  Which makes no sense  Oh  Sorry  Anyone  You're right  I always say  How nice of a person  Any one of you are  Except  Me  No  No that's Mick Jagger  Spelled  That's Mick Jagger  Spelled like McDonald's  Right  It's  This idiot  Wrote Mick Jagger  Big  Capital M  Small c  Capital J  A  G  G  E  R  Mick Jagger  Like 
[00:26:30]  Go to Mick Jagger's  Can I supersize that please  At Mick Jagger's  And let it be known  Not one period yet  This is one long sentence  This is known as a rambling ass  Yeah go ahead  I always say  How nice of a person  Any one of you are  Except Mick Jagger  I read an article  About you  And how you  Didn't like Mick Jagger  And now  Paul gave him the song  I want to be your man  As a favor  And then he was 
[00:27:00]  Bad mouthing you  After you lent him a song  That will bug me forever  Ugh  Ha ha ha  I have heard  I have heard  Another page  This is the last part  I have heard  Yeah I got it  I have heard such great things about you  And if someone says anything bad about you  I never believed it  Because it is never true  Yoko is so beautiful 
[00:27:30]  See it should be  It was never true  Yoko is so beautiful  That's how I would read it  Yes  Yeah I think she went  Because it's never true  Yes  She looked like  Droopy tits McGillicuddy  I never believed it  Because it is never true  Yoko is so beautiful  I read that you loved  The one photographer  Because his picturey  Made Yoko look  That is the word  Picturey 
[00:28:00]  Because his picturey  Made Yoko look  Even more beautiful  It was apparently  A photo of someone else  Even more beautiful  Than she really is  Give peace a chance  Love Madeline  P.S.  I love you and Yoko  Now wait for your response there  Madeline  How old is Madeline 
[00:28:30]  I don't know  I didn't see her  I think Madeline's like  A stalker patty  Type thing  But only really  Really really retarded  Madeline's an ass  And it looks like  It's from a  Like little notepad  Because it's ripped out  Of the spiral binder  Angrily ripped out  Yes  Angrily ripped out  That person  Is insane  So then  Well the next video  You gotta just check out  For yourself  I tweeted it  I decided I was hungry 
[00:29:00]  During the sing-along portion  Of the festivities  And I videotaped myself  Reaching down  And picking up  One of the hippies  Green apples  And taking a bite out of it  It's during  What song?  Jimmy  It's more of a visual  That's nice  Green apple  I love you  I was right in the middle  We love you  And your foot's on the flower 
[00:29:30]  Foot's on the flower  And you took a bite out  Of their dumb apple  Their dumb green hippie apple  That's pretty funny  It was almost poignant  For a second  Because you had the apple  And it was like  Apple records  And shit like that  And then it's up to the people  And they're all having fun  And then it slowly  Goes down  And you just see  The apple with a giant bite  Taken out of it  And nobody's dumb foot  On the fucking flowers  I just sat there  For like two hours 
[00:30:00]  Man  What a bunch of  Dolts  And then  Finally we can move on  There was so much more  But the one other thing  That stands out  I decided to be a real asshole  And try to start  The give peace a chance  Chant  Because that's what they do  When they get together  All you gotta do is start  I live in the area  I've seen it happen  A million times  And before you know it  Thousands of people  Are dumb  So I wanted to be the guy  Right  For once I wanted to be the guy  That starts a chant  I always wanted to be the guy  At a sporting event  Or at a Lennon thing 
[00:30:30]  To start the chant  And I failed miserably  You gotta fail?  Yeah  All we are saying  Is give peace a chance  One other person singing right there  All we are saying  Is give peace a chance  I tried  They're not ready for the showstopper yet 
[00:31:00]  I didn't want to give up  Watch  All we are saying  Stop saying  I'm looking at them all  Looking at me like  You're an asshole  Give peace a chance  Later?  Hello  Later  There's a set list?  Hello  Really?  Yeah, that's kind of a late night  When it gets dark  You come here every year?  Yeah  What does John Lennon mean to you?  You know  Love peace and all those good things 
[00:31:30]  Singing music  In 2000 years he's going to be Jesus  Yeah  Yeah  That's all it takes  Yeah  That's funny  Late night when it gets dark  When it's 410  410 it gets dark  Let's sing  But they explain to me that you do the give peace a chance thing later in the fucking day  With the candles?  Yeah, there's a whole schedule to their horse shit  Everyone start yelling at me, later  We do that later 
[00:32:00]  We do it later  What are you doing?  Right  You're ruining John Lennon's dead thing  You're not following the schedule  Exactly  Mark David Chapman is responsible for that anniversary  Yeah  It's not like it's his birthday  No  Right  It's like they're celebrating Mark David Chapman doing what he did  Yeah  He probably thinks that they're all there like celebrating his deed  You're welcome  Look what I did  Yeah, you're welcome  Thank you very much  So I had fun being an ass at the fucking 
[00:32:30]  I think it's funny that you couldn't even get a give peace a chance  Chance started  Oh yeah  Yeah, at the place  Oh yeah  And I understand  Because there's apparently a set list  I understand how douchey that sounded  It's very funny  I felt uncomfortable even trying  And then to get yelled at  Because it wasn't time for that  It's not time?  What are you doing?  It's not dark?  Right  Do you know what I noticed?  And then the sun went down  And it literally was 10 degrees out  And I said, I'm done with this horse shit  Just when it was getting good, by the way  But I was like, I gotta go home 
[00:33:00]  I'm gonna get the fucking flu  What were you saying, Jimmy?  I'm sorry  No, no, no  It's funny when you asked her what Lennon means to her  She was ready to cry  Yeah  I'm just like, if you ask anybody what a certain bad means to them  It'll make them sad  Yes  What's so-and-so mean to you?  Well, it's  Well, what does Sabbath mean to you, Jimmy?  I don't know  I don't know  Kick ass  Kick ass  Listen to the words  Yeah  When you tell somebody, what does that mean to you? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, what does it mean to you?  What happened?  Breaking news  Howard Stern signing with Sirius Radio for another five years  Of course  Everyone knew that  I am  Five years  Breaking news  Howard Stern signing with Sirius Radio for another five years  Now we know where our money went  I wonder what the deal is  I guess we'll find out  I'm sure  It's for the exact same fucking money  No  Good for him, though  I'm happy  I would love to  Better for stock, I think  I would love to make that much money  I'm not gonna fucking lie to anybody  Hey, who wouldn't, right? 
[00:34:00]  But, you know  Right?  Today should be a good day to get stock  No  No  It's probably gonna be up  No, it won't be up  It might be up  I think it'll jump a little bit  It might be up  It might have a little bump  And then it'll go back down  Maybe a few pennies  Yeah  I don't know  I'm buying two million shares  Guy who doesn't know how to do stock  What will that cost you?  Two thousand dollars?  Boy, I wish I would have done that when it was a nickel  Yeah  Fuck, dude  Are we done with the John Lennon thing? 
[00:34:30]  Because the last major interview came out  From Rolling Stone  Yeah, I thought they had that better fucking tape recording equipment back then  It's all crackly  No one thought to maybe, you know, save this stuff properly?  Yeah  Where was it?  That stupid closet at N.E.W.  Oh, right  Just rotting away  God, you think that closet's still there?  Or do you think they finally got all that shit out of there?  That shit's gone  They had an archives at this old station we used to work at 
[00:35:00]  N.E.W.  The biggest rock and roll library  They had shit that people would pay a ton of money for  Yeah  Live performances from every band you could imagine  Yep  Live Bruce Springsteen  Live Rolling Stone  Everything  Yeah  I think they even have some John Lennon recordings in there  Because he used to just come up to N.E.W. and hang out  Because he lived in New York  Hang out with Scott Bune  And the rest of them  Well, we could try this  John talks about being older  And seeing things from a different perspective  In his last interview  I'm not claiming divinity 
[00:35:30]  I've never claimed divinity  I've never claimed purity of soul  I've never claimed to have the answer to the light  I've never made any claims  I only put out songs and answer questions  As honestly as I can  But only as honestly as I can  No more nor less  I can't do any more  I can't do any less  But I cannot live up to other people's expectations of me 
[00:36:00]  Because they're illusionary  And the people that are wanting more than I am  Or than Bob Dylan is  Or that Mick Jagger is  Or that the new punks will become  Because they have to grow up too  I cannot be a punk in Hamburg in Liverpool  Because I'm old enough  I cannot be 18 and be a punk  And pretend to be socially concerned with pimples 
[00:36:30]  And the state of the welfare  Okay?  Which I was at 24  I see the world through different eyes now  I still believe in love, peace and understanding  As Elvis Costello said  What's so fucking funny about love, peace and understanding?  Well, it doesn't sound like it's an interview from the turn of the century  Yeah, I know  No, just the voice too, you know?  Mary had a little laugh  My fleece was white at snow  Yeah  That was great  Yeah  To hear him talking like that 
[00:37:00]  Like people expect more out of me than I can get  It's great  You know what?  And now look  Yeah, but no one listens  And no one listens  Because he is a deity  Did that air anywhere though?  Or this is just found out?  Supposedly this is one of those interviews that never aired, I think  How did they not air this?  I don't know  It's great  I don't know  We're waiting for the 30 year anniversary to release it?  I don't know the back story on this  Maybe they just found it?  Who forgets they did a Lennon interview?  I can't live up to that  Maybe it was transcribed and thrown in their magazine  Oh  And so, but you're hearing it for the first time, obviously  Fuck, that's great, dude 
[00:37:30]  That's great  Oh yeah, Sam, what's the back story on this?  Quickly, Sam  With an accent  Sam!  It was a magazine interview  Like it was just for Rolling Stone  So that's why they just kind of  Oh, they put a shitty little recorder  Yeah, the tape was just kind of there for  Yeah  So this was transcribed  It was in an old magazine, right?  Yeah, I mean  But now we're hearing the recording for the first time  Yes  Yeah, but the problem is, man  He's a deity  I was there, man  These people are just all about it  Yeah, they're making him a holy man  All about it  And he was the one that even said  No 
[00:38:00]  Huh?  No, just fucking  Yeah  But not some songs  And he said, I can't  And I can't pretend to be concerned  With the state of the welfare  Like I'm not a punk like I was  You know, it's great  Yeah, he's getting older  He's getting older  It's like, yeah  Just like a real person  Yeah  Amazing  Sure  Leonard talks about maturing  And realizing that we are all part of the problem  When I was younger  Younger  I could say when one is younger  But maybe they'll think that's too ego  You know, I'm not allowed to speak on that level 
[00:38:30]  Because that upsets the little turds, right?  So let's put it like  When I was younger  I used to think that the world was doing it to me  And that the world owed me something  And that either the conservatives or the socialists  Or the fascists or the communists  Or the Christians or the Jews or the fascists  Were doing something to me  And when you're a teeny bopper  That's what you think  I'm 40 now  I don't think that anymore  Because I found out it doesn't fucking work 
[00:39:00]  The thing goes on anyway  And all you're doing is jacking off  Screaming about what your mummy and your daddy or society did  But one has to go through that  For the people who even bother to go through that  Most assholes just accept what it is anyway  And get on with it  Right?  So for the few of us who did question what was going on  I have found out personally  Not for the whole world  That  I am responsible for it  As well as them 
[00:39:30]  I am part of them  There's no separation  We're all one  Right?  So in that respect  I think  And I look at it all  And think  Ah, well  I have to deal with me again  In that way  Well, you're not going to have to deal with yourself  Too much longer  That to me  This was right before he died  Amazing  So much better  Wow  Than the people that are standing around  Just listening to his songs  And, you know  Love and peace  The guy had such a great grasp  On what the fuck was going on 
[00:40:00]  He really was a bright guy  Yeah  Fucking, uh  I blame the fascists  The communists  The conservatives  You know, everyone  And, uh  And I was like  Fucking jacking off  Saying what mommy and society  Your parents and society did  That was great  He, uh  He didn't believe in Imagine  He just wrote it  Yeah  He obviously didn't believe in his own song  Nah, it's just kind of like  Eh, whatever  But these people out there  Still believe in it  Yeah  That's great  How great is John Lennon?  I would just be blasting that  You're a bunch of little turds  You motherfuckers  Yeah  You pretty much said that 
[00:40:30]  Imagine who killed him  A little turd  In the end  That's exactly who killed him  A little broken turd of a man  Right  What a fucking honest guy though, man  That's pretty good  I just, Mark David  I'm just annoyed  Thinking about the guy  Shooting him  Because he's a selfish  Little fanboy  Yeah, that's what it was  Selfish little fanboy  Fat cunt  And then, uh  John talks about  Pretending to be a tough guy  As a kid  I come from the  Macho school of pretense  You know, I was never really 
[00:41:00]  A street kid or a tough guy  I used to dress like a teddy boy  And identify with  Marlon Brown and Elvis Presley  But I never really  Was in real street fights  Or real down-home  Gangs and nothing  I was a suburban kid  Imitating the rockers  And, uh  But it was a big part  Of one's life  To look tough  You know, I spent  The whole of my childhood  With my shoulders up  Round the  Round the top of my head  And my glasses off  Because you weren't  Supposed  Glasses were sissy  And walking  In complete fear  But with the toughest 
[00:41:30]  Looking little face  You've ever seen  You know  Getting into trouble  Just because of the way  I looked  But thinking that  That's what  What it was  You know  Wanting to be this  Tough James Dean  All the time  Took me a lot  Of wrestling  To stop doing that  I still fall into it  When I get insecure  And I still drop  Into that  You know  I'm a street kid  But I have to keep  In memory  I never really was  You know  I don't know  I don't know  Whether I would have  Survived on the streets  Of New York  When I was 16  You know  I was a little fruit  When I see some  Of the kids around here 
[00:42:00]  Wow  Yeah he dressed as a teddy  That's great  Believe it or not  Teddies were really  Tough guys  A teddy  Tough teenagers  In England  Yeah  And they took on  That persona  Of the Beatles  In the early days  They were all dressed  Like they were really  Fucking tough  When we played  The Cavern  Right  Yeah that was  Brian Epstein  Threw them in the  Fucking suits  That's pretty cool  You guys are going to  Be wearing the suits  And Lennon hated  Wearing the suit  I looked like a fruit  Yeah  Yeah there's their  Tough guy look 
[00:42:30]  That was their  Tough guy face  With Pete Best on drums  They were teddies  Leather jackets  They were trying to tell  People they were teddies  Leather pants  Yep  Looking all badass  And Epstein said  That ain't going to  Work man  For mainstream success  No  Then he threw them  In their jackets  They wore ties  At first right  Did they  I think so  Yeah probably  And finally  John talks about  Leaving music  This is literally  Months before he died  The last album  Was the rock and roll  Album  With a picture of me  In Hamburg  In a leather jacket 
[00:43:00]  And at the end of that  I was finishing off  A track that Spectre  Had made me sing  Or just because  Which I didn't really  Know all the rest  I'd done before  As a teenager  So I knew them  Backwards  I couldn't really  Get the hang of it  It was the hardest  To sing  Because I hadn't known it  Which one  Just because  Yeah  I never did that  At the cabin  In Hamburg  All the other numbers  I'd sung before  Live all my life  Since they were out  And at the end  Of that  I was mixing it  Here in Record Plant  Just down next door 
[00:43:30]  In this next studio  And I started  Speeling at the end  Of Just Because  And I was saying  And so we say  Farewell  From Record Plant  And a little thing  In the back of my mind  Was saying  Are you really  Saying farewell  And I had not  Thought of it then  And I was still  Separated from Yoko  And still hadn't  Had the baby  But somewhere in the back  Was a voice  Saying  Are you saying  Farewell to the whole game  But it was just  Flashed by  Like a flash  Like that  And I didn't think 
[00:44:00]  Any more of it  Until a few years later  When I actually realized  I had stopped  And I came across  The picture  Which is in the office  The original  The office that I met you  In today  The original picture  By Jürgen  Is there  Of me in the leather jacket  Leading against the wall  In Hamburg in 62  There you go  So  That's  That's great dude  Three days later  Was that three days  Before it was shot  Three days  Later  God damn man  Three fucking days later  He had a lot to say man  And he was starting  To say a lot of it 
[00:44:30]  I know  He really did change  Three days later  How fucking  He'll be a fun interviewer  I think his image  You know  Because his image  As a Beatle  Was so fucking huge  That it took him so long  To just keep talking  Like that  Right  For people to go like  Oh  Wait a minute  Because a lot of people  I don't think  Liked this John Lennon  No I know  Especially the older people  That were you know  Brought up on  On the Beatles  And stuff  They didn't want to hear  John Lennon cursing  And sounding like this 
[00:45:00]  They wanted the  Four lovable mop tops  But this was the real  John Lennon  Right  The entire time  I've read  As much as I goof on  The whole thing  I've read a lot  On John Lennon  I like John Lennon  He was my favorite  Beatle  Whatever  He was a rebel  And he didn't  He didn't like the persona  He was in the Beatles  He hated it  It was an act  He hated it  He loved the money  And all that for a while  But then he just  Got sick and tired of it  Yeah  And wanted to move forward  To some other things  Isn't that cool  Otto got to perform  In front of him  In the park  What?  Crazy 
[00:45:30]  Lennon put a dollar  In his  It's a story  Years ago  He told me that  That he was performing  I think Lennon  Lennon threw a dollar  Or two  Watched him  And then threw a dollar  Or two dollars  In his hat  How about he throws a hundred  He was a Beatle  Maybe he did  Threw a five  Chapman should have  Shot George  Save John  Show us how the dollar  He shot you  Shot my puppet  So there you have it  Should have kept  Those dollars  Yeah  But he didn't think  Now we could all move on  Stupid Otto  He probably brought  A roll with him  Wish he was here right now 
[00:46:00]  So he could kiss his mouth  Sometimes I do that  Well  The Beatles  Some say  The greatest band  Of all time  Yes  I  And we could argue  The second greatest band  Of all time  You think Rolling Stones  I think  Moon Age Daydream  Of course  And we'll be  Playing some Moon Age  Daydream next  We should do that  On what  I have an update  On what  Moon Age Daydream  Moon Age  Moon Age  Was the song  I think  The band was called 
[00:46:30]  Mando Birch  Mando Birch  Is the second greatest band  Of all time  What  Yeah I don't know  Steve sent this to me  Yesterday  He says  The name of my band  Was Mando  B-Y-R-C-H-E  Birch  Birch I guess  Mando Birch  What the fuck  Is that  And then he goes  And I have  Over an hour  Of awful music  Including another song  Written by me  Called  Good Time Boogie  I also  Oh god  No he didn't write a song 
[00:47:00]  Called Good Time Boogie  Also in my possession  I have Dr. Steve's  1970's era  Driver's license photo  Yeah the photo's great  You've seen that right  Filthy greasy hippie  He looks like  Now do you understand  Why I wonder  If he was a swinger  Back in the 70's  He looks like  Fucking Rico  The coke dealer  Or like a young  A young friendo  Yeah he was  He was getting  Some 70's  Earth Mama muff  Oh you know that  He had the look  Long hair  That the broads  Wanted back then  The hippies  His band still plays too  Yeah  Yeah 
[00:47:30]  Where are they playing  You know  I don't know  But  No I can't  Vote for that  They'll be playing  In Atlantic City  Wow  Believe me  I feel like I need  A shower after this one  On January 15th  Late Show  And the opening  For them will be  Me, Jim Brewer  David Tell  And Bill Burr  That's fantastic  Because our dumb show  Is sold out  But the last and final show  Goes on sale tomorrow  Morning 10am  It's the 11 o'clock  Saturday Late Show  Great  It will sell out  And this is the last one

[00:48:30]  He looks like a fucking  A male escort  That was pulled out of like  A celebrity's fucking hotel room  With blood on his fucking collar  It looks like  No matter what  No matter what you're looking for  Dr. Steve in the 70s  Had it for you  Yes  Unless it was a good phone call  To a radio station  In which case  He most certainly did not  How does that guy  Become a respected doctor  I have no idea  He's not  Yeah good point  Oh my god  Wow he was a pretty handsome guy  Back in the day  He probably got some tang 
[00:49:00]  I bet  Back then  Sure  If you wanted  It's a 40-conoline van  You have to tap it  And the C's will roll out  In the album  And then you all  Roll it up  Smoke it  Use the Yes album cover  Double album  To separate your C's  Very serious picture  He's trying to look very cool  In that picture  No smile  No nothing  He's like a peak friend  What do you think  His drug of choice was  Cock  You loved cock  Doctors  We're going to play 
[00:49:30]  Mooninch Daydream next  After the messages  From 1975  Dr. Steve's band  From back in the day  Back in the day  Only an Anthony show  On the virus  Sirius XM 
[00:50:00]  What's up everybody  What else is going on in the world  Hello  The John Lennon thing  Was a big deal yesterday  Certainly was  Oprah announcing she's not gay  That was big  Not gye  We got the Aretha Franklin  With the pancreatic cancer  Diagnosed yesterday  That sucks  For her  I don't know her  She'll live on with her music  That's all I care about, right? 
[00:50:30]  Thank God.  Thank God V8 spills very slowly.  Wow.  It just tipped over on my computer.  And like a little fucking blob came out.  A little blood clot.  Yeah.  Looks like the curb at Geely Plaza.  Bloomberg.  Possible presidential campaign.  Yeah, have fun.  Good.  Do it.  Stupid Bloomy.  Give it a try.  Bloomberg.  You're ruining this city.  Huh? 
[00:51:00]  Then the whole country will be fucking little islands with flowers on them.  Yeah.  Asshole has no respect for traffic at all.  A bike lane from fucking New York to California.  It's New York, Mike.  It's New York.  A lot of bike lanes and a lot of trees.  Fucking annoying, dude.  A lot of trees.  I don't mind that stuff.  I think it's good, and I understand why you would like it.  But as someone who drives, in a cab even, sometimes I hit traffic coming here.  Yeah.  At five to six in the morning or six in the morning, there's traffic on Broadway because 
[00:51:30]  there's two fucking lanes.  It's not a little village.  This is a giant city.  You just can't do it.  Stop.  It's so irritating.  It's so irritating.  Yeah, he's playing Sim City with fucking a real city.  Fucking asshole.  Let me see what happens if I shut down this road and put in a bike path.  You get a bunch of angry people.  It's like, what if fuck you to delivery guys, that is, and people who have to drive for a  living?  It's like, I don't like cabbies, but that's a shit job. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Another thing they're doing, let's see, they want to rename the Battery Tunnel to the  Hugh Carey Tunnel.  Ooh.  Isn't Hugh still alive?  Who's Hugh Carey?  That's going to catch on.  Who's Hugh Carey?  He used to be a governor.  Yeah.  Governor.  Why?  I know.  The Hugh Carey Tunnel?  Who gives a fuck?  This is an even better one.  Call it that.  Can I guess?  Which will never happen.  Yeah.  Oh.  The better part of that, I would assume, how much money it's going to cost to change all  the signs, because we get that every once in a while.  Well, that always, yeah, that's always a big thing. 
[00:52:30]  It costs millions of dollars to change the Triborough Bridge to the Robert Kennedy RFK  Bridge.  And they still call it the Triborough.  I would never say, take the RFK Bridge.  No, I go Triborough.  It's like the Triborough.  It's always going to be the Triborough.  Is that going on with the Hugh Carey thing, or no?  I think a lot of people just call it the Battery Tunnel, but this is an even bigger one  that's coming up.  They want to change the Queensborough Bridge to the Koch, fucking Ed Koch Bridge. 
[00:53:00]  Why?  Who cares?  To commemorate Ed Koch for being a mayor of New Yorker.  Is it a bridge that bumps into another bridge?  Two bridges?  Of course, they're docking bridges.  Doesn't a bridge need a tunnel?  What a waste.  It's a waste, because first of all, no one's ever going to say, yeah, you take the Ed Koch  Bridge.  That bridge will always be the Queensborough Bridge or the 59th Street Bridge. 
[00:53:30]  Of course.  It's never going to be the Ed Koch Bridge.  And for the rest of America, that's the bridge that is featured prominently in the opening  credits to Taxi.  Taxi and The Godfather.  And more so, if you remember, a little movie called Turk 182.  One of my favorite weird movies.  That was at the end, when he was changing the light letters on the bridge.  That was the Queensborough Bridge.  I don't know why I like Turk 182.  I think because it showed New York as very gritty.  Yeah, I like that time for movies in New York, because New York was just a disgusting mess. 
[00:54:00]  New York City.  With like, big buses with just smog coming out of it.  Also, The Godfather really confused everybody in the New York area, because they used the  Queensborough Bridge, making believe they were going to Brooklyn.  GW.  No, going to Jersey, maybe?  No, they, well, what's the famous line?  It is, yeah.  They were going to Brooklyn, right?  It was supposed to be the GW. 
[00:54:30]  They were going to Louie's in the Bronx.  It was supposed to be the GW, because to New Jersey, there was an arrow.  But they used the Queensborough Bridge that goes to Queens.  It didn't look like the GWB.  No.  No, it was the Queens.  It was the Queensborough?  Yeah, positive.  And he makes the U-turn.  Nice work, Lou.  Right.  Because you want to lose somebody behind him.  It didn't, it would never work.  You can't get to the Bronx with the Queensborough.  I don't know why I was just thinking.  Why am I even trying to fuck you?  I don't know why I was thinking of that, though, this morning.  I was thinking of the fuck. 
[00:55:00]  Maybe they were going to take the Whitestone of the Throg's neck.  Hey.  That's way out of the way, sir.  There wouldn't be a Jersey sign.  There was a Jersey, there's a two Jersey, that's why he goes, we're going to Jersey?  Right.  Maybe.  You can't go to Jersey that way.  Right, that's why you know it was supposed to be the GW.  Right, but they used the Queensborough.  They had to.  I'm still trying.  No, you're right, though.  They had to.  It doesn't matter to anybody.  That night, they were painting the George Washington Bridge, and they would not stop painting for filming.  Is that true?  No.  No.  I knew it.  I knew it. 
[00:55:30]  Why didn't they just use the GW?  That I don't know.  Maybe you couldn't jump like that.  Maybe you couldn't make that turn on the GW.  You can't make it on the, oh wait, how did they do it on the Queensborough?  They just spun around.  It might have just been easier to do the shot on the Queensborough.  It probably was.  Yeah.  Well, so the Hugh Carey Tunnel.  Hugh Carey Tunnel.  And the Ed Koch Bridge.  That's fucking stupid.  Stupid.  It's really dumb to read it.  Because, yeah, changing the signs, which you would think would cost like eight bucks, it usually winds up costing, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  To change the name will cost the city $4 million apiece.  Like, where did $4 million come to change the name?  And can't we use that for something else?  Yeah, like taxes being lowered.  Yeah, people will just yell and scream how New York's broke.  Yeah.  In New York City especially.  And then they do something like that when you know they could use that money for something else.  Yep.  I also hear the service on the MTA is at its all-time low, even though they raised fucking prices through the roof for people. 
[00:56:30]  The service is at an all-time low, which is great.  It just goes to show you again that these motherfuckers can't manage money.  And, as Rudy Giuliani put it, the only bookie operation in the world that loses money, OTB, closed down.  Yeah.  They closed it.  They lost OTB.  How do you lose fucking money when you take people's money for betting on horse races and pay them when they win and keep it when they lose, and they lose more than they win? 
[00:57:00]  How do you lose money?  You know how?  Through fucking shit management, through people lining their pockets, through too many fucking chiefs.  It's just, it shows exactly, that is a perfect example that any layman can understand of why nothing works.  You wonder why the MTA loses money when they're taking in billions of dollars, and people always have to go somewhere. 
[00:57:30]  They're using the trains, the buses, the tolls, everything.  And you're like, how can they lose money?  Because they can lose money as a bookie.  No bookie loses money!  And OTB had to close down because they're out of money.  That's just amazing.  It stuns me.  We all know bookies.  They don't lose money in the end.  They don't lose money.  Overall?  You never have to go and bust a bookie's leg for not paying you off. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  I mean, because they made money.  They know how to do that shit.  Yeah.  With the odds and all that.  They make money.  But OTB had to close down, which does not bode well for the local tracks here in New York.  Saratoga's talking about the fact that they're not even going to be able to survive without money from OTB.  Saratoga?  Yeah.  Springs?  Saratoga Racetrack.  Upstate?  Yeah.  That's a big one.  Belmont?  Same thing.  Big month for them.  Aqueduct?  Same thing.  These people, a lot of people don't go to the track to place bets, but a lot of people were going to OTB to place bets. 
[00:58:30]  Now, how does that work?  When you make a bet with OTB in the old days, obviously now, the track gets some of that cash?  Yeah, yeah.  The track would get some of the cash.  I didn't know that.  So now everyone has to go to the track to bet.  To bet, right.  Oh, yeah.  They're fucked.  No one goes to the track.  Maybe the Belmont Stakes, things like that.  So OTB is nationwide, right?  No, I don't think it is.  Oh, it's just local?  I think they have different ones in different places.  It felt like OTB was nationwide. 
[00:59:00]  So it'll fuck up the local tracks.  Or do you think another business will take its place, another type of OTB?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's state-run, though.  I think that seemed to be the problem.  It just shows you what the state's all about.  Because the state and the city, they can't do anything right.  Like you said.  But they can't get a private organization to do it because it's, you know, hey, you're a bookie.  And God forbid the private organization does it, does it right, and they make money. 
[00:59:30]  And then New York goes, hey, we want that.  We want to do that and get 50 people for the job of one and lose money.  Does that speak volumes or what?  It does.  New York would just overtax them anyway if a private person did or a private company.  They would.  They would just fuck them on taxes for succeeding and drive them out that way.  Yeah.  It's shitty.  New York really is dumb.  Can we go back to the tunnel thing for a second?  Tunnel?  Well, yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. 
[01:00:00]  I was just kidding.  Yesterday, my biggest fear happened, and thank God it didn't happen to me.  The Lincoln Tunnel.  I hurt myself?  It's a biggie.  That Lincoln Tunnel.  You know how they sometimes decide they've got to close a tube or two?  Yeah.  And then, so then what happens is you drive onto oncoming traffic in this tiny tube.  In the tunnel, yeah, yeah.  When you split the, uh...  Yeah, it's a sport.  It's my greatest fear, because usually a tube, obviously, is traffic going one way. 
[01:00:30]  You get two lanes nice.  Yeah.  Every once in a while.  Not every once in a while.  They do it a lot where they close enough of them down.  So now you're driving right at cars coming at you.  And there's no...  First of all, the lanes are really narrow.  Yeah.  Second of all, if, God forbid, someone does do something wrong, you can't go anywhere.  Oncoming, you're just, yeah.  You don't even have a shot to...  You can't swerve.  You can't swerve off the road or nothing.  You're just dead.  Fucking bus driver yesterday has a seizure and does just that.  Oh, he did? 
[01:01:00]  Oh.  Just that.  In the tunnel?  In the fucking tunnel.  He crashed into oncoming traffic?  Oncoming traffic, my fear that I've thought of forever.  Did he kill anyone?  I don't know what the results were.  That must have taken forever to clear out.  The traffic must have been crazy.  I'd have just been mad.  I believe he crashed into like four cars.  Oh, I'd have been beeping so hard, people would have been like, this guy.  It's crazy with this beeping.  Yeah, what is he?  Beep city over here?  Bada beep, bada boop.  Get out of the tunnel.  But why do they do that? 
[01:01:30]  I know.  It does seem very dangerous.  Kind of cool, though.  Let's see.  Drivers in the Lincoln Tunnel facing delays after a New Jersey transit bus collided with  four vehicles in the South Tube.  A crash occurred about 2, 10 p.m., right?  Middle of the afternoon, not too bad.  Suffered a seizure in the bus shortly before the New York-bound tunnel.  Cool.  Oh, wow.  Not life-threatening.  How many people were aboard the bus or if anyone was injured. 
[01:02:00]  They don't know.  Yeah, that's...  Everybody just veered right into oncoming traffic.  Oh, can you imagine a bus is all of a sudden in your lane and you can't swerve?  I hate when those buses are in those tunnels anyway.  They never go fast enough.  No one ever goes fast enough in those tunnels for me.  I hate the people that step on the brakes before they go into the tunnel, too.  There's no reason.  Right.  It's a lane.  It's just as big when you're outside the tunnel as inside the tunnel.  But they jam on the brake before they go into the tunnel like,  Oh!  No! 
[01:02:30]  Move!  And then every curve and turn, the brake lights go on.  Just drive like it's a regular fucking lane.  You gotta line yourself up nice, right?  Set yourself up nice and just keep your speed.  I go through those gates like horses taken off.  Like thoroughbreds taken off when the fucking bell rings.  Also, there's no fucking reason to stop behind the vehicle.  One vehicle goes through the gate and then the gate comes down. 
[01:03:00]  And then you wait.  The gate goes up and go.  Just get on the guy's ass and go right through the fucking thing.  There could be a line of cars going right through without the gate having to move.  Why do we have to have the gate?  The gate is stupid.  But it's only New York has the fucking gate.  Jersey got rid of the gate.  Yes, E-Rock?  E-Rock's got input.  The Lincoln Tunnel, they don't have any of the gates.  But people will still come to a full stop at EasyPass.  Oh, I know.  It's just ridiculous.  Because they want to see the little light that says EasyPass paid.  Right.  Green light. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  It's like you don't have to see that light.  It doesn't matter.  If it doesn't light up, are you going to stop and ask the person,  Hey, the light didn't come on.  Excuse me, sir.  You're going to go anyway.  Just go.  My whole fucking thing with driving is just go.  Yeah, you're right.  Hey, Dave C. in New York City.  Forget bridge names.  Ant started us down this path.  Look up New York City's plan to change every street sign to lowercase letters. 
[01:04:00]  Why?  No way.  No way.  Can you find that story?  Why would they need to do that?  And that's more waste.  Why?  Is that it?  Why?  Why?  New York City might not go ahead with sign changes.  New York City current street signs are here to stay.  At least for now.  God.  At least for now.  Not for the pop-up.  The Federal Highway Administration was requiring that all 250,000 New York City street signs 
[01:04:30]  be changed to the upper and lowercase font called Clearview.  The Fed said the drivers can identify the words more quickly with the upper and lowercase  mix, particularly at night.  Oh, my God.  Because they're all capital letters now.  Right.  If you look at a street sign, the whole street name is all in caps.  How does the upper and lowercase make it easier?  I don't know.  But has everybody been getting lost forever? 
[01:05:00]  What the fuck?  It's GPS now anyway, assholes.  Yeah, who's looking at street signs?  I just go, at the next street, make a left turn.  Yeah.  It's a common theme with this show.  It's just people just overthinking everything all the time.  Who came up with this?  I can't drive unless it's in Helvetica.  I made a left at wingdings and dingbats.  Gregory, I need Times New Roman or I can't find where I'm going. 
[01:05:30]  The font is not correct.  Perry.  Oh, there's Perry.  That's stupid.  Speaking of fonts, you know that there's a whole movement to get rid of the, what is  it, sans?  The sans font?  Why?  Sans?  Yeah, I made a few of my videos using the sans font.  Who doesn't like the sans font?  There's a whole movement.  They'll attack you, your videos and everything.  Because they feel like people are overusing it. 
[01:06:00]  It's kind of, what is sans?  What is sans looks like?  It's kind of like comic-y.  Oh, comic book-y.  It's like handwriting.  People are obsessed with getting rid of that font for some reason.  There's a whole movement in it.  There's a whole group of douchebags out there.  I guess there is.  That are in touch with each other and attack you if you use that font.  It looks like handwriting.  Why would anybody?  I would never care.  Never.  But people are out there that have nothing else to do with their lives that will attack  you if you use that particular font on something.  I've got to change my fucking nickname now? 
[01:06:30]  Fuck that.  What's your nickname?  Sans font-y.  Can we go back to that street sign thing?  Oh, it's so silly.  That is really a waste.  That's someone overthinking their job.  Do you think that they do stuff like that to give jobs to people?  I can't comprehend how that helps.  It's someone just like around here.  We'll try not to bitch today because I understand you guys don't like a lot of the bitching.  But it's someone trying to just justify their existence and their job. 
[01:07:00]  That's all this is.  Overthinking their job.  And let me tell you something.  Because they're saying that, I guarantee you there's already been a multi-million dollar  study on capital letters as opposed to lowercase and recognition in street signs.  Sure.  So they went through this whole expensive fucking program.  And then to enact it, 250,000 street signs?  So that's got to cost maybe, I would guess a dollar per sign. 
[01:07:30]  So that's $250,000.  A dollar per sign.  You know what one of those signs would probably cost?  Oh my God.  How much do you think it would be?  Probably $100 per sign?  To make it?  It's not even the making of the signs.  It's probably the human manpower to actually install them.  All that.  If you gave me 10 street signs and you were like, you got to get these done today, I would  take my sweet ass time.  My sweet ass time.  I would love to know what it would cost to do that.  And it's all union labor that's doing it.  So you know that the prices are really jacked up and they could probably only put up so many 
[01:08:00]  per day.  What happened?  One guy has to be handed the sign to put it up.  You need a three-man crew at every street sign.  What happened to you, man?  What happened to you?  You were a union guy.  Yeah.  And it sucked.  Because I would have liked to have been able to just walk into my boss and ask for a raise  like the old days, instead of having to have a fucking union delegate go to my boss and  get me a .03% raise per year for fucking 18 years of knocking 10. 
[01:08:30]  And my fucking negotiator was my fucking stepfather, Sal.  And he couldn't even help you out.  No!  You're helping him out now.  He was the guy.  You should remind him of all the times he should have helped you out a little more.  He was my union delegate with Sal.  So he would go in and negotiate my deal.  He was your eatman before you had any money.  He was.  He'd go in and be like, oh, Sal's here.  He must be negotiating with my boss.  Nah, I'm in a bad mood.  And then I'd get something like three.  It would be 3% increase for two years. 
[01:09:00]  And then the third and fourth year, you'd get like 5% increase.  Wow.  And when you're making $350 a week, it really doesn't amount to that much.  It really doesn't.  That's the other thing that companies got rid of.  Yeah.  Cost of living raises.  And then I had to kick it back to Sal, half of it.  Oh, really?  Oh, because it was all, you know, organized crime.  I'm teasing, of course.  They got rid of the cost of living raise.  Most people don't get that now.  Most people don't get that either now.  It's okay.  Forget about it.  They just fuck you at every turn if you work now. 
[01:09:30]  At least we get a Christmas bonus, though.  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait for that.  That's so funny.  I know.  Can we just do that one more time?  It's timeless, isn't it?  Christmas bonus.  You're just automatically out in the middle of the woods, the dark woods.  Where's my Christmas bonus?  No one's hearing you.  Just crickets.  No one's hearing you.  I really believe that we were the ones that kind of started that cricket thing.  You see it everywhere now. 
[01:10:00]  I love the cricket thing.  I don't want to do the hoo-hoo-hoo thing today, but...  No, I remember.  Actually, I do remember seeing it in, like, Bugs Bunny episodes.  Bugs Bunny used it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, then I should shut the fuck up.  I remember Otto years ago on stage, if a joke would bomb, he would go, cricket, cricket,  cricket.  And then he would just go, el grillo, whatever it is in Spanish he would say.  It was really funny.  A clown.  Wow, am I way off today.  Hey, so the signs, they're going to change the signs.  Signs, signs, everywhere.  Then you've got to hear, once again, how the city and the state is broke. 
[01:10:30]  It seems like if someone just looked at their books, they could easily find money.  Easily.  Yes.  Wasted money.  Wasted money everywhere.  Began the estimated $26.6 million process.  $27 million to change the signs.  Come on, you forgot the important word.  Taxpayers to pay.  Oh, of course.  $27 million for lowercase street sign changes in New York City.  $27 million to go lowercase. 
[01:11:00]  Now, we've been around a while now, right?  I would think so.  Do you know of one fucking person that has complained about street signs in your life?  I've never heard of this.  Let's not even make a joke.  I've heard complaints that street signs were missing or street signs were turned the wrong  way.  They're bent or something.  And that happens everywhere.  Whether you get lost on Martin Luther King Boulevard.  Yes, that's another one.  I'm at the corner of MLK and Malcolm X Boulevards.  Those are the best help.  So someone has decided to spend $27 million of our hard-earned money to change something 
[01:11:30]  that obviously none of us have ever heard of being a problem.  It does seem to me, though, that it's the Federal Highway Administration requiring the  city's Department of Transportation.  So this is an order that came in from the federal government.  The feds?  It's not just the state saying it.  So that's the only thing I'll let the state off on.  Well, how about the federal government realizes that this is not important right now while  we're broke, you fucking idiots?  Each new sign will cost $110. 
[01:12:00]  I guessed about $100.  I was almost there.  Officials say they will have $11,000 changed by the end of the fiscal year, but already replaces  about 8,000 signs a year due to wear and tear.  Shit.  So, oh, God.  Can I tell you something?  This world is fucked up, and if I could convince my family, I want to be a mountain guy.  I want to escape.  You just want to get away?  I want to escape all this.  I really do.  You have problems up there, too, though. 
[01:12:30]  Not like this shit.  The fucking, the bears would do something that annoys you?  I would deal with it.  I would become a hunter or something.  I can't take this.  I can't take this shit you see going on around you.  I watch the news.  I get so angry.  Why are they doing this?  Municipalities across the country are expected to comply with the changes, and we'll have  up until, let's see, until 2018 to do so.  We'll wait until 2017, and then just go, do it real fast. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, who's fucking, who's bothered?  I've never not, I've never said I wish signs were lowercase.  Yeah.  Right.  I've never known anybody that has said that.  How about you do one sign a year for the next quarter billion years?  Because I, quarter million.  Quarter billion years.  Quarter million years.  Here's the thing.  With everything being GPS now, anyway, it's like enough, we don't care.  Street signs eventually are going to be fucking holograms, or just, stop it. 
[01:13:30]  If you're going to change them, really change them futuristic, like Blade Runner and shit.  Yeah.  I bet you, after they spend the $27 million, then I would love to walk around and ask people  if they even noticed.  No one's even going to notice.  Did you notice?  That they changed them.  It's so easy to make the turn now.  Yeah.  And with GPS, it's like, it doesn't matter, you just scroll, you could get rid of the  signs.  Make a left.  Okay.  How long until you just have like a HUD on your windshield that just overlays Google Maps 
[01:14:00]  on the windshield?  That overlays it, and then in one little corner, like a PIP thing, you'll have like the street  sign, virtual street signs.  Or maybe like a little GTA map sort of.  Coming up, coming up.  Yeah, yeah, GTA map.  Yeah, shit like that.  Let's get some fighter plane technology in the cars, and if you can't cut it, don't  drive.  And I want the driving test to be a lot fucking harder than just parallel parking and driving  around a block that isn't even hard to drive around.  You ever see the driving test?  They take you around a little neighborhood, make you go, stop sign, a light, parallel park, 
[01:14:30]  and you're done.  And then these idiots get on the highway, and they have no clue what to do.  They're fucking doing 20 miles an hour on an on-ramp to a highway, and I'm behind  them.  I was about to say, the part of the driving test should be entering a highway from a highway  gas station.  And if you fuck that up, you don't drive.  You can't drive.  Then you don't fucking drive.  The tests should be a lot harder than they are.  And if you can't fucking do it, because it ain't a right, it's a fucking privilege to 
[01:15:00]  drive.  It's not a right.  You don't have the right to drive a vehicle.  And it should be a lot harder.  It would be safer.  It would get idiots off the fucking street.  It might get idiots to actually learn how to drive and get on a highway.  When I hit that fucking on-ramp, I am doing at least 60 miles an hour on the on-ramp.  And cars are doing the same speed I'm doing.  I could drift in anywhere.  I don't care.  And if I have to, you accelerate a little bit, or you let off the gas a little bit.  I'm not jamming on the brake, because the end of the ramp is coming up.  Like, I see so many little Asian faces looking out the window, with their arm out the window, 
[01:15:30]  their head craned completely around, at the end of the ramp, looking for an inn, with  cars doing 70 past them.  No, you fucked up, didn't you?  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  Oh, my God.  You fucked up.  There is one word I have been yelling driving home more than I ever have yelled before.  And it's not the N-word.  Very good.  A lot's going on.  They're going to pardon Jim Morrison today, after four years. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, good.  What's his comment?  There's his widow.  Man, there's something to be said about dying young.  Ew.  He would be way here next to that.  She was beautiful back in the day.  You see what she looks like now?  She was fucking smoking.  Look at him, man.  Looks like a rotten fucking pumpkin.  An American poet, man!  Don't mess with my Morrison.  Oh, please.  Shave your dumb beard.  I can't believe you never liked the doors.  No.  That saddens me.  American poet.  That saddens me.  He was the American poet.  But by the way, I think there is better music than the doors. 
[01:16:30]  Of course there is.  Oh, sure.  Fucking ABBA.  No, no.  Moon Age Daydream, man.  Oh, that's right.  Just to finish up on the signs before we move on, wouldn't it be great if they used the  worst font possible to change the signs?  What would be the worst font to use for straight signs?  Oh, God.  One of those script ones that are really too thin and high.  What's one of those fonts where your fucking eyes go batty trying to read it?  Does anyone know the actual name of one of those?  Yes.  I know the signs because that's the one that people hate. 
[01:17:00]  But even that is like print.  People are saying that's like doing a hacky radio.  Papyrus?  Is papyrus bad?  Papyrus?  Oh, that would be really hard to say.  Which one are we trying out for the street signs?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know if, you know, because these days, who knows if everybody has all these  fonts in them.  It doesn't matter.  But Blackadder ITC is pretty shitty.  Blackadder ITC.  It's very thin cursive.  Very thin cursive. 
[01:17:30]  Imagine if every sign looked like that.  That's like oldie English written with a quill.  It's like the Captain Morgan's font.  Wow, there's just too much going on with that B.  Yeah.  Brush script I'm getting is bad.  Brush script?  Curls or GG?  Yeah, that's a bad one.  Wait, I want to get a really bad one.  That's an awful one. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  That would be hard to see on a street sign coming up.  That hurts on the eyes.  But get like the most despicable one ever.  That's what we're trying to figure out.  Yeah.  What's the one where like the letters get really thick but also really thin in places?  Oof.  One of those comedy wacky ones?  Nah, that's easy.  I don't know if it's just wacky.  That's kind of wacky looking comedy.  Which one was that?  That was called Joker Man.  Joker Man.  Joker Man.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Go up. 
[01:18:30]  Go up to that Arabic looking shit.  Yeah, what is that?  Oh, my God.  That would be impossible.  Which one is that?  Matura MT script capitals.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty hard.  Someone's saying monotype Corsava.  Yeah, that's a hard one.  We'll do this until we really get one that just fucking...  Anything really thin and curly-whirly.  I don't have like crazy stuff on him.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Another dump that I started. 
[01:19:00]  Fucking idiot.  Piece of shit.  Fuck yourself.  Go live in.  Go climb a mountain and live there.  The world would be a better place.  Yeah.  I want to hear Dr. Steve's band.  Can we take a break before that?  Yeah, we could do that.  All right.  The song is called Moon Age Daydream, right?  And the band is?  I forgot already.  Shite.  Hang on.  Yeah, you have to look it up again.  Mondo Birch.  Mando.  Mando Birch.  Not even Mondo.  Mando Birch.  Mondo Birch. 
[01:19:30]  Mando Birch.  Mando Birch.  A palaver.  I want to hear Mando Birch.  All right.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM. 
[01:20:00]  A little peace frog for everybody.  That's the go-to door song when we talk about the doors, I guess.  E-Rock doesn't know any other doors songs.  You know any doors songs, E-Rock?  We have a few others here.  Yeah.  What would you play?  Refrigerator door.  Because you play this every time we talk about the doors.  I haven't played this in a long time.  Yeah.  It's the only one we play.  Trust me.  No.  There's Backdoor Man.  It's the only one we play.  Oh, Backdoor Man.  Roadhouse Blues.  Because I was ready to go into my same speech I've said a hundred fucking times about Peace 
[01:20:30]  Frog being my favorite door song and blah, blah, blah.  Give me another one.  Maggie McGill?  Is that how he said it?  Kind of something cakey, Kenny.  But not flaky, Kenny.  Not flaky, cakey.  He likes cakey, but not flaky.  Yeah, yeah.  God, we know each other way too much.  I like cakey, not flaky in the morning.  Flaky is an afternoon thing.  Flaky would be like an apple turnover.  That's flaky.  But cakey is like a marble cake thing. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The kind of gush mushy.  What about Enemans?  Enemans is cakey.  You wouldn't eat that?  No, I would.  Wait, cakey not flaky?  I want cakey in the morning, flaky in the afternoon.  And then bukkake at night.  That's good any time of the day.  Marble cake sucks.  I love marble cake.  Out of all the cakes you can have.  The chocolate and the cakey stuff.  Marble cake.  With the cinnamon on top.  No.  Fresh marble cake. 
[01:21:30]  It is good.  I hate fucking marble cake.  Smells good.  It's a conglomerated mongrel cake.  But the problem is it's all round like a bunch of marbles.  Oh, they're not really round.  Tip.  Hey.  He just gets mad at me.  He gave me a look.  He shot me a look because I refuted his marble cake claim.  Yeah, we're going to play Dr. Steve Sawyer, I swear.  I want to hear it.  In a few minutes.  But really quickly.  Really quickly.  Yeah.  I know you're a huge fan of Snooki.  So there's a big Snooki story to them. 
[01:22:00]  Speaking of round.  Yuck.  I think this is a great idea on MTV's part.  I really do.  Really?  I'm not a fan of the Snookster.  No.  Not at all.  I actually hate her.  I despise her.  Stand her.  Trying to be all sexy in that pistachio commercial.  Have you seen that one?  No.  Ugh.  Really?  They got everyone doing that.  Louis Black's doing one.  I saw fucking Blagojevich doing one.  Blagojevich is doing one.  And then what's his name?  I think a football player's got one, too. 
[01:22:30]  What's a football player?  Lyle Alzado.  He's a black guy.  Yeah.  His brain's the size of a pistachio before he died of brain cancer.  Does he get it?  Oh, my God.  They're trying to make her look sexy.  I know.  She's not sexy.  She's by a tanning booth.  And she got a little, uh, she's gaining a few pounds there, huh?  Yeah.  I think she actually does look kind of sexy there, honestly.  They put a jacket on her to cover up her fucking club.  Dude, she's not bad.  They're fat tits. 
[01:23:00]  She does have fat tits, but I want to work them like a speed bag and not have any pleasure  with them.  You think Snooki's sexy?  In that moment there, yeah.  No.  That little silk rubber, fucking big fat rump.  No.  They even got Keyboard Cat to do one of these.  Keyboard Cat rules.  Really?  Keyboard Cat.  Yes.  Epic.  This is epic.  Look at how cute Keyboard Cat is.  I fucking hate Keyboard Cat.  This is epic.  Any cat on the internet is adorable.  Keyboard Cat does it perfectly.  Look at Keyboard Cat.  Wonderful pistachios.  I love Keyboard Cat.  I would love Keyboard Cat if he had a fucking tire track to his back. 
[01:23:30]  You know, I don't care.  Call me a faggot.  Cats on the internet are the...  Okay, faggot!  What's next?  Thank you.  Cats on the internet, hysterical.  And adorable.  I don't know why, and they have such longevity.  I like Ron Livingston better.  Ron Livingston as the Keyboard Cat.  What the fuck?  That's fantastic.  I guess he was just sick of all the Keyboard Cat shit like everyone else. 
[01:24:00]  Did Ron Livingston just do this?  Yes.  Who is he?  Ron Livingston's hysterical, man.  He was in Office Space.  Office Space.  That's probably his best name role.  Not Band of Brothers, too.  He was fucking amazing in that.  I did not know that, sir.  I did not know that.  Yeah.  So, Snooki.  I'm not a fan of Snooki, but I think this is a great idea.  Ron Livingston as Keyboard Cat.  I didn't see that.  I did not see that.  It's great.  Snooki will have ball at New Year's, is the headline.  Los Angeles, California.  How many in our mouth?  Some people celebrate the New Year with a little Nookie. 
[01:24:30]  MTV plans to ring in 2011 with a little Snooki.  Oh, great.  Gotta hire better writers from the newspaper.  The network plans to put Jersey Shore star Snooki inside a ball that drops in Times Square  as part of its New Year's Eve special.  I hope it drops without any cable or anything.  They just fucking kick it out of a helicopter.  Like Omar.  Like Omar.  Like Omar.  Just...  They hang her like Omar.  The copter hits the ground from her weight.  You expect me to believe Snooki's pussy smells like the West Shore Expressway because Omar 
[01:25:00]  says so?  They say that.  I said I will not fuck her, Tony.  She's fat.  I told you a long time ago not to step on my foot, you fucking little elephant.  I'm keeping track.  We've done The Gay, The Godfather, and now Scarface.  Yes.  And Jesse.  We've done The Jesse.  Yes.  And I've complained.  So this show is almost another perfect one by us.  I don't think I've been racist yet. 
[01:25:30]  I was looking at...  Oh, you were with the marble cake.  Conglomerated marble cake.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  You squeezed that.  Your very essence is...  I'll be honest, though.  That was Danny.  I was looking at old Audible descriptions for what has gone on on the show in the past.  Oh, no.  And it could have been, like, a description from today's show.  It was just like Andy Rooney said some dumb shit.  People get confused.  They're like, they're not updating Audible.  No, we are every day.  Just looks like the exact same show every day.  Same show.  When you go back and read it in a little bit. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I know.  So, MTV, the 23-year-old known nationwide for her...  Whatever.  Says Snooki will be there.  They're trying to set a fist pump record, also.  So, people are going to be fist pumping.  Oh, no, they're not.  And then they're going to drop Snooki in a ball.  In, like, a glass ball or something like that.  And at New Year's...  I don't know why it's such a big deal to get the biggest audience on New Year's.  Everyone fights for the biggest crowd. 
[01:26:30]  CNN gets the...  It's always New Year's Rockin' Eve.  Yeah, of course.  I think New Year's Rockin' Eve.  And Dick Clark this year is still going to be co-hosting?  It looks like it.  Ryan Seacrest will once again host Dick Clark's New York's Rockin' Eve  with musical performance by Daughtry and Jennifer Lopez.  Yuck!  That's good.  That's Rockin' Eve.  It's fuckin' horrid.  Daughtry's okay.  I don't like Daughtry.  He can sing.  I don't like him.  I really like Daughtry.  I just wish he...  I like him, but...  I just wish he went a different direction and didn't go so poppy.  I think the name of his band stinks, too. 
[01:27:00]  But it's kind of smart on his part for more mainstream success, but...  It's just his last name.  I wish he was more of a rocker.  He's very successful.  I know.  He's one of those very successful guys that came off of that show,  and there's been a few that just haven't done shit.  Yeah, I like...  And he didn't even win the fuckin' thing.  He's a very humble guy, too, it seems.  So let's go to Mark in Palm Springs.  Ah!  Wonderful.  Mark, real fast.  Hello.  Yeah, hello.  Palm Springs.  You're on the air, Palm Springs. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, Snooki looks like a bell.  I can't hear you, dude.  What'd you say?  Your phone's cut out.  Snooki...  We heard you!  Every time.  Oh, man, you got...  I love when you set the hook.  Check that off the list.  Check that off the list.  You got one of those done.  Ah, Jimmy thinks Snooki's hot in that commercial.  In that?  I think she's sexy.  I have some more to do.  Her face looks a little...  What a way to bring in the new year.  Yeah.  I don't find anything attractive about her. 
[01:28:00]  At all.  Some of the older pictures of her aren't bad.  I would go Angelina...  That's a surprise.  I would go Angelina way before Snooki.  JWoww, obviously.  Yeah.  And then I would throw in a little Sammy Sweetheart before the...  Look at that, she's a fire hydrant.  Jimmy, look at that.  Come on.  She's not...  I'm not saying...  They dress her up nice for the pistachio ad, but she's a fucking pig.  She has big, giant, suckable tits.  She has big, fat hips, but I mean, she's not...  They put a jacket on her for the pistachio thing. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  They had to put a jacket on her.  Right.  Because she's standing by a tanning booth.  Right.  Or a little tanning bed.  Why the fuck would she be wearing a jacket?  Right.  I don't know.  To cover up her big, fat ass and her Mary Lou Retton torso.  She's just a big camel toe lady.  This just in from Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Next to Snooki, Dick Clark will be lowered in a iron lung.  Oh, poor Dick Clark.  Really?  Well, I'm sure, believe me, when we come back, we will have his countdown. 
[01:29:00]  We will just be laughing.  I wonder how it will be this year.  Do you think it will be better or worse than last year?  He'll still be doing it when we come back.  Wasn't he way off last year?  Oh, by eight seconds.  Seven, eleven, two.  Oh, that's right.  He got the numbers wrong.  Five.  His only job was to count down.  Monday, Wednesday, eight, to Sunday, Saturday.  Oh. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah, man.  Oh, yeah.  Is this Manson's record?  This is the Should Have Stayed Lost tapes.  Oh, come on.  It was just ready to kick.  It was just ready to kick.  Oh, we're going to kick.  I want to hear it kick.  Just for the setup.  That's Dr. Steve's band from 1975.  What's the name again?  I bet you not one person's room.  Mando.  Birch.  Calrissian.  Mando Birch. 
[01:30:00]  Mando Birch.  This is Mando Birch.  Who's Mando Birch?  Well, I was a doctor.  We're going to have Dr. Steve on in a few minutes.  He's probably some awful guy.  He invented catheters.  That's probably right.  They play this music at the hospice to clear beds out.  Because it kills the people.  Dr. Steve. 
[01:30:30]  Yes, here it is.  Smell the glove.  I'm an alligator.  Dr. Steve on Vox, by the way.  That is Dr. Steve.  What is him singing?  Vocals.  Vox.  It's just going to be V-O-X.  You've got to say V-O-X.  That's him singing?  Yes, yes.  And he's an alligator, it seems.  It seems, from this song, it seems Dr. Steve is an alligator.  Now, I don't go too deep with David Bowie. 
[01:31:00]  I know David Bowie had a song called Moon Age Daydream.  Is that this song or no?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll pick it about now.  I'll find it.  Does he sing about alligators, David Bowie?  Let's go back to Dr. Steve on Vox.  I'm an alligator.  I am a mama, mama, baby.  I'm hearing it is a Bowie cover.  Okay. 
[01:31:30]  Valtrex once a day, hey.  I'm filled up for fluid.  Yeah.  Yes.  Savage out of the vagina  Into the underpants  Oh, that guitar is  Oh my God 
[01:32:00]  Right now Dr. Steve is sticking himself  With dirty needles from the hospital  He should be  The drummer who Doyle's band  Wow, these guys should be singing comfortably numb  In front of a record store  Now we're almost halfway done, Ant 
[01:32:30]  Wow  You want to critique the band  You've been in a few bands in your life  What do you like, what do you don't like  Even given that the recording is  It's obviously a one mic live recording  Not done through a board or anything  So it's going to sound a little odd  It's the only positive thing I'll give him  His voice 
[01:33:00]  If he's trying to do a Bowie impression  I don't know  I hear a little Bowie in there  A little bit  I hear a lot of safety dance  He's a little pitchy  A little pitchy  He's a little pitchy  Dog  One of the guitarists, if there's two  I can't even tell  Are abominable  He needs to tune  And the drummer  That run wasn't quite a run  Yeah, the drummer doesn't sound very good either  He was clicking sticks when he's trying to get around the kit 
[01:33:30]  Oh, I think the bass player fucked that up  Very spinal tap-y right here 
[01:34:00]  I gotta play now  You're in tune 
[01:34:30]  Yes  I can play  I was jamming when I talked to Steve  It's like those videos  Where they get somebody who's been gone for a while  Or dead or something  And you play with them  It's great  I can't wait to see  Mando  What is it?  Mando  Birch  Mando Birch  Chris 
[01:35:00]  We'll just be actual footage of him  We have a Stonehenge monument  And that was a thread to be crushed by a dwarf  Viking blocks fecal matter  From producing and being released through the coal and the bough 
[01:35:30]  And, uh, oh how they dance the little children of Stonehenge  No, we're not gonna do fucking Stonehenge  Yeah  Yeah  Ha ha 
[01:36:00]  That's Nigel Tufnell  Ha ha ha  Dr. Nigel Tufnell  Ha ha ha  Wow  Kevin from Connecticut says  I got a fever  And the only prescription is more Mando Birch  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Uh, a couple things  Actually, wait a minute  Play the better song by them 
[01:36:30]  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  I don't think this is the same band  The drummer's much better  Ha ha ha  So is the guitarist  So is the vocals  Ah, ah, get the fuck out  Ah, get the fuck out  You're no Tufan son of a bitch  P.A. John, you fucking genius  Ha ha ha  Um, and that's for queers and retards 
[01:37:00]  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  I'm joking  They're there, they're there  They're there  Love this song  I'll fix people  Do you know how important that is?  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Yeah  You gotta play through it  Ha ha ha  You gotta play through it  If you play through it  You're playing through the whole song  Cause it just sucks  The, uh, it wasn't that bad though, right?  Uh  We've heard worse  Well, considering it's from what?  19-1?  75  75, okay  And the band's brave enough to do an obscure Bowie song  And they were, um 
[01:37:30]  I would guess  How old would you put Dr. Steve at?  Approximately in 75  I'd say 20  20?  20?  How old is Dr. Steve?  I don't know  I'd say he's probably, uh, 55  Holy shit  I don't know  I wouldn't put him at that old  Oh, maybe he was younger?  17?  Yeah, yeah  Okay, so it's 52  Let's find out  Oh  The lead singer  The man on Vox  Of Mando Topless  I mean  Mando Birch  Uh, Dr. Steve on the line  Dr. Steve, first of all  The name of the band was what? 
[01:38:00]  Mando Birch  And why Mando Birch?  No idea  We just thought it sounded cool, man  Were you guys smoking a lot of dope back then?  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  I think you could tell  You guys talked over my fantastic synthesizer solo  I heard  No, we heard the wild  I forgot that  Woo!  Yeah, he's playing keyboards, too  I forgot about that  Oh, my God  Did you have Leslie cabinets? 
[01:38:30]  No, I wanted one  I couldn't afford it  Yeah, those are the good ones  They spun around the speakers  Yeah  A rocked organ  And a mini Korg synthesizer  Oh, a Korg synthesizer  You were fucking styling back then  Sam  Did you do any shows?  Yeah, we did one  Or maybe two  We were together for like three years  And maybe played three gigs  That's a lot of practice  We were so arrogant 
[01:39:00]  That we would only play songs  That we thought were good  So, you know, we were playing stuff  That nobody wanted to hear  What was the set list for you guys?  Self-serving crap  Name some of the other songs on your set list  Moon Age Daydream from Bowie  Yeah  Well, I mean, we played  Gosh  Now that I think about it  It was  We played some Todd Rundgren  Oh my God  Todd Rundgren  Well, because the guitar player 
[01:39:30]  The really awful guitar player  At the time  And that  He was a big Todd Rundgren fan  Oh my God  You guys just didn't want an audience  No, absolutely not  You know, if we could  If we played beach music  We would have been huge  Right  Yeah, with a little surfing music  Play a little fucking  Peter Frampton or something  Yeah  What's the matter with you?  And how many people were at that gig  That we just heard?  Oh, that  There was like  Two high school girls  Oh, I was going to say  Not including the band  So I'm going to assume here  That you didn't get laid that night 
[01:40:00]  Dr. Steve  Absolutely not  You know, I got into it  Because I thought there would be groupies  I was sadly disabused  Well, not playing that kind of music  Yeah, you should have played the Beatles  You idiot  No, we were  No, we were  You know, the guitar player's dad was rich  And we played in their basement  And he offered us  To bankroll us  If we would just play the songs  He told us to play  Oh, okay 
[01:40:30]  And we told him to go fuck himself  And that was  You know, that was the turning point  Because if we had done that  We probably had some chance  Of at least playing a few gigs  Yeah  We played one high school gig  And they just basically  The kids in the high school  Just basically booed us off the stage  Oh, high school kids  Booing you off the stage  Yeah, because they wanted to hear  You know, stuff that people liked  Yeah  Not the stuff that we were playing 
[01:41:00]  Did you guys do any tall?  No, we weren't  Later on we did  Now, I will have to say  That when we got into our college  Farther into our college years  Because I was 19 when we did that  And post-college  We actually got halfway decent  And then we turned into a jazz band  I could flip  A jazz band  That's when the band just gives up  When you go jazz  It's like, ah, you play what you want  I'm going to play what I want 
[01:41:30]  We'll call it jazz  Oh my God  What did you used to wear?  Just regular clothes?  Or do you have gig clothes?  Oh, no, no  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  He goes, oh, boy  Uh-oh  Oh, no  No  I had this  It was a fleece-lined  Like goat leather jacket  That I wore  What a waste of a goat  Some kind of paisley bell-bottoms  Or something  Oh, God  I would love to see that 
[01:42:00]  A goat being worn by a donkey  Oh, it was awful  And then  That was the one song  They let me sing two songs  There was that one  And then  Good Time Boogie  By John Mayall  Good Time Boogie  And I didn't know the words  So I just made them up  And just kind of went  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  That was really bad  I'll play that on my show  That would be a tease for my show  Oh, nice  But I think what's great about the Moonate's Daydream thing 
[01:42:30]  Is the fake Cockney accent  Where I, you know, say  Put your spice spice close to mine  By  Can we hear a piece of the original by Bowie?  You got that in the system?  You're a fucking douchey.  That really is.  Wow.  I want to hear what the song's supposed to sound like.  Oh, no.  The song itself is very good.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, this is Bowie.  That's good.  This is good.  That's a cool song.  I never heard this fucking song.  I have.  No, you haven't.  Now, Dr. Steve, why did you put the same name on your song that David Bowie put on this one? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, right.  The Improntery.  Because your song was very different than that.  I didn't.  Yeah.  It was an homage.  Jared Davis from Kansas.  This is the shortest and saddest behind the music ever.  What is the band doing nowadays?  Is there one guy trying to keep it going, keeping the dream alive?  Yeah.  Calls every once in a while and says, come on, man. 
[01:44:00]  We could still do this.  What do you want?  Be a doctor for the rest of your life?  Is there one of the guys?  Well, there's my, the guitar, the rotten guitar player has actually turned into be a really great guitar player.  Oh.  He went to school and did a music major and actually learned how to play his instrument.  Oh, that's good.  He still has a new band all the time.  You can see him on Facebook under Syntax.  S-I-N-T-A-X.  Get it? 
[01:44:30]  I get it.  Syntax.  Syntax, but Syntax.  But he's, he's quite good.  He's quite good.  Okay.  And we did get the band together probably 15 years ago when I did, oh, it doesn't matter.  I was going to say, a death concert for the people at the hospice.  You all got together and played?  Yes.  Look at him.  Yes.  How was it?  Well, what we did was we played a bunch of songs that I wrote, and I just, those were 
[01:45:00]  the guys that I knew that knew how to play, and so we played one gig in Greensboro for  kind of an art crowd, and that actually was quite good.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't.  It wasn't.  Yoko was better in front of the art crowd.  What was the, what's.  At that point, we were doing Captain Beefheart.  What's one of your songs that you wrote?  Another obscure, weird band.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  God, you're annoying me.  What's the song you wrote? 
[01:45:30]  Echo and the Bunny Men?  I'm sorry.  Sweetie, what's the song you wrote?  What's the song I wrote?  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, I wrote a, oh, I wrote a rock opera called The Spirit Sweet.  Wait, you laughed at it.  The Spirit what?  The Spirit Sweet.  The Spirit Sweet.  Oh, yeah.  And sweet like, you know.  No, S-U-I-T.  Right, right.  Do you remember some of the words?  Sure he does.  Yeah, sure. 
[01:46:00]  All right, give us some.  On that visage of the sun, where the ancients are as one.  I was a yes fan.  But who are the ancients?  I don't know.  You're a Spinal Tap fan.  Old Perry.  Spinal Tap.  It sounds like Spinal Tap.  Give us a little more.  You can't just stop there.  And oh, how they dance, the little children of Stonehenge.  The stranger walks a lonely file, unthinking worlds beyond the trial of sullen masks and  moons and asks.  The thousands' heraldry below. 
[01:46:30]  Frozen cold beneath the snow of 100,000 stars.  P-roll for Philly.  Shitty band, shitty wine.  Yep.  That's me.  Here's a poem for you.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  When I see you, I think boo. 
[01:47:00]  Wow, he wrote a rock opera, though.  Oh, that's hilarious.  The elders.  What are they called?  The ancients.  Yeah.  What are the ancients?  What are they?  I don't know.  They're ancients.  They're old people.  Yeah.  And they did the same shit we did.  Yeah.  Hey, give us a little more of that, though.  Very mysterious.  I think that was that.  Yeah, you don't want to know.  It's a short rock opera.  Yeah, that's very short.  Let me see.  I should have not.  Well, I'd have to start from the beginning. 
[01:47:30]  Who was your influence for the rock opera?  Was it The Who and Tommy?  People are calling it quadriplegic phenia.  Quadriplegic phenia.  Did Yes do a rock opera?  Well, no, but they did.  These sort of, you know.  Well, yeah.  Tales of topographic oceans.  Can I hear a little of that?  Tales of topographic.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to the beginning and you'll hear me because it's.  Oh, yeah.  You're just like John Anderson. 
[01:48:00]  You're just like John Anderson.  Silence of soul sources.  Fiction infusions of.  Oh, I would hate to have your record collection.  You got that?  I loved that stuff back then.  Now I just listen to System of a Down, so I'm all right.  I kind of got it.  All right.  E-Rock, you got that?  System of a Down syndrome.  Of course.  Does he say no because he wasn't listening?  Because I saw him on his phone.  E to the R.  Do you know what we're looking for, E-Rock?  That Tales of topographic oceans. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yes.  I'm not seeing it in here.  Man.  He's probably spelling a T-A-I-L-S.  Of course he is.  It's not part of your system.  Man.  Dr. Steve.  Oh, here it is.  This was Dr. Steve's influence.  This is great.  Yeah.  Not yet.  This isn't it?  Oh, no.  It says First Movement Part One.  Yeah, First Movement Part One, no?  Maybe Yes did a...  No.  No?  Sounds like a deodorant commercial theme.  It might as well be. 
[01:49:00]  How are you saying it's no?  I don't think that's it.  This is the intro.  All right, what?  This it?  Yeah.  Tales for topographic oceans.  What's that even mean?  Well, topographic is topography.  And oceans are wet.  Not it either.  I don't know what that is.  All right.  Dr. Steve's saying this isn't it either.  Maybe you had the wrong song.  Yeah.  I'm starting to think you have the wrong song.  Either you or the whole internet.  Maybe you were thinking of Close to the Edge, huh?  I like Close to the Edge. 
[01:49:30]  That one I can handle.  Yeah, I like Close to the Edge.  I can handle that one.  You just went way too fucking deep half the time.  Long Distance Runaround?  Yeah.  Yours is No Disgrace?  Yeah.  They were a great band.  They really were.  Slow down, Lee Abrams.  Great Instrumentals.  I have the live Yes album still in my rotation and my CDs.  That's the only thing like that that I still listen to.  What's your favorite Yes song?  Seepage of a wound. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Yours is No Disgrace, definitely, up there.  Yeah.  Viscousy Fluid is a really good one off the second album.  Viscousy Fluid.  Anything else about Dr. Steve's band?  Yeah, I like Putrescent Festering.  This fucking song is all right, man.  That sounds like Carcass.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  So fucking groovy.  The album covers were great for Yes.  You weren't a Yes fan either, right?  Clean and weed on it.  Nah, I was for a short time back in the 70s.  The 70s, yeah.  Yeah.  Anything worse than when a Yes album came out and you looked at the actual album and saw  one fucking groove?  You're like, get the fuck out of here.  I paid for one song on this side of the album?  One song.  That is, that, I just dated us so bad right there.  Well, you know, you could be a kid and listen to that. 
[01:51:00]  Still trying to make believe we're in our late 20s, early 30s.  Make believe, what?  Fragile.  A terrific album by Yes.  Yes, Fragile.  I just like John Anderson.  Yeah?  Yes.  All right, Dr. Steve, should we let him go?  Oh, please.  It's good of you to share that with us.  Steve, you doing a show Saturday?  No, it's Big Kev this weekend and then we're on the 18th.  You guys have to switch back and forth or no?  Yeah, yeah.  We're alternating with Big Kev.  Why?  Well, I could only get my guys together enough times to do two shows, maybe every three weeks. 
[01:51:30]  So we were doing two shows and then a rerun, two shows and a rerun.  The reruns were just pissing people off.  So this way there's no reruns.  But you're the type of guy, not to take away from the other guys, because I do listen to  your show and I do enjoy the whole cast, but you've got such a unique show.  No, you and phone calls, worse.  Yeah, you do it yourself.  Yeah.  When those guys can't get it together for you.  Oh, my God.  Cigars and Scotch is saying from crap bands to lap bands. 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  All right.  Good one, my friend.  Good one.  Good one.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Take care.  Bye, Steve.  All right, boys.  Thank you, Steve.  Go kill someone today.  Oh, no.  He's the angel of death.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, he's the angel of death.  Yeah.  I wrote a song about it.  Sometimes I feel like Chief in Cuckoo's Nest.  I say, I'm taking you with me.  And then I throw a sink through the window after smothering Agnes. 
[01:52:30]  Agnes.  Her crooked nose.  Yeah.  Sitting there looking at him.  She was dripping Jell-O all over her hospital Johnny, so I put a pillow on her face to help  her swallow.  I threw a sink through the window.  Wow.  That was really, that was something there.  Yeah.  I liked how his recitation, his recitation of some of those vocals from his rock opera. 
[01:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  The Rock Opera.  The Ancients.  Yeah.  The Elders.  Where the Ancients are.  Yeah.  What are the Ancients?  The Elders.  Why do Ancients assume to have, how come no one says the Ancients were really dumb fucks?  Yeah.  Sick of the Ancients being seen as smart.  What a coincidence.  It's ironic.  Now he works with the Ancients as they're dying.  What are some of the key words to that genre of music?  Shitty.  Well, the Elders.  The Elders.  Ancients.  Uh, Ancients, uh, fucking can't think. 
[01:53:30]  Castle.  Well?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Mystical.  Mystical, yes.  Very mystical.  Mystical's a good one.  Druids.  Think Dio a little bit, because they went down that road more.  Yeah, Dio.  And the way you should.  The Forest.  The Forest is one of the key words for that shit.  The Forest.  Elf Clits.  Elf Clits.  Shamans.  Or shamans.  Fairies.  Fairies.  Unsheathed cocks.  Yes, yes.  Yes, very good. 
[01:54:00]  Docking.  Docking is another one.  Wiccans.  Wiccans, very good.  Wiccans.  I'm just reading off of the list here.  People are very good.  A seer.  A seer, very good.  I'm saying a seer.  Yes.  Ah, yes.  Pagans.  Pagans.  Fuck.  Yes.  Lords, Wizards, and Warlocks.  Nice.  Very good, Kevin, from Connecticut.  What else?  Yeah, it's good.  You've got to think more nature, too.  The Forest was a good one.  Sigars and Scotch are saying Elf Come.  Elf Come.  Is that really in there?  Uh, yes.  Elf Come.  Yes. 
[01:54:30]  Um, yeah.  Oh, unicorns.  Unicorns.  Unicorns.  You need the unicorns.  Very good.  Yes.  I hate unicorns.  You don't like the unicorns?  Fucking horses with a deformity.  That's what we are.  Big wings.  Probably shitting all over the place through the clouds.  Imagine you're flying and a horse shits on your 767.  Goes right through the fucking window and kills the pilot.  Giant horse log.  Thick, blocky horse shit on your wing.  Takes an engine out.  Yeah.  That's what happened to Sully. 
[01:55:00]  It wasn't a goose.  It was unicorn shit.  Big fucking road apple logs.  A road apple.  Spectro from Michigan.  Uh, the dawn of time.  Yes, the dawn of time.  Misty mountains is coming in from Chris in Virginia.  Dawn of time's a good one.  Yeah.  The Ancient Mariner, yes.  In the beginning.  The Ancient Mariner.  The Ancient Mariner.  Oh, The Ancient Mariner sails the seas of life.  Prophets and Hermits is coming in.  I think we just need to go through the entire lyrics of every Iron Maiden song ever. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, Iron Maiden was really good for doing that.  It's Iron Maiden.  It's Final Tap.  Oh, don't forget.  Kevin from Connecticut really coming up a lot.  Kevin knows his music big time.  You can't forget the Ferryman.  The Ferryman.  There's always the Ferryman.  It's terrible.  Dragons, of course.  Tree nymphs.  Tree nymphs.  Yeah, yeah.  A labyrinth.  Uh, the Overlord.  These are terrible. 
[01:56:00]  Pegasus.  If you have one of these in your song, just shoot yourself Pegasus.  Mystery Rings of Stones.  You have the Ancients.  Ruins.  Oof.  What river?  It wasn't just the river.  The River Styx.  Well, I know River Styx, but there was other ways they described the river.  Um, Mystical River, uh, uh, children laughing for the ages.  Children laughing.  Yes, the children.  Did we do, did we do goblins for the ages? 
[01:56:30]  Sirens.  Did we do that?  The void.  Sirens and catacombs.  Whoever said Ancient Mariner, they must have been looking at Iron Maiden and stuff, right?  Or is that just like a coincidence?  I don't know why.  Because there's a song.  He's probably, he's probably a fan.  The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariners.  Yeah, that's quite one passed.  Yeah.  But he, but they, they did it right.  Uh.  Perfect.  At the bottom of the Hidden Lake.  The Hidden Lake.  Purgatory.  Yeah.  Purgatory.  We did Ancient Lure, right? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, that's about it.  Excalibur.  Excalibur.  That's a good one.  You gotta have Excalibur in there.  Anything mythical, of course.  Mythical.  That's the point we're making.  Yeah.  I, I, I was never a fan when that shit hit.  No, it just, it just stinks.  It's shit you can't sing along with.  You can't relate to it.  It's just horrid.  And the mermaids. 
[01:57:30]  Yes.  The sirens.  What about the lake?  Singing you into the rocks.  How do they do the lake?  An abyss.  An abyss.  An abyss.  Yes.  Sword in a stew.  Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner is really, like, it's got it all.  Yeah, it really does.  Can you read the lyrics to that?  Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.  Please read it.  See his eye as he stops one of three.  Yeah, hang on.  Let's get something wrong.  You're not a poet?  Yes, he is.  Oh, I was trying to be a poet.  Jimmy's the poet.  I don't know.  Jimmy reads poems.  Let's get some beats.  How about we share it?  I would allow Andrew the first verse. 
[01:58:00]  I would be happy to share it with my friend.  Or maybe I'll just do the chorus that never comes up.  No, I would rather share it with my friend.  All right.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  I'd actually rather have Jimmy do it.  I was just reading it for my own curiosity.  We'll share it.  Cauldron's.  I will read the first verse.  Hear the rhyme of the ancient mariner.  See his eye as he stops one of three mesmerizes.  One of the wedding guests.  Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea. 
[01:58:30]  Ugh.  And the music plays on as the bride passes by.  Caught by a spell and Mary tells his tale.  Driven south to the land of the snow and ice.  To a place where nobody's been.  Through the snow fog flies on the albatross.  Hailed in God's name.  Hoping good luck it brings.  And the ship sails on back to the north through the fog and ice.  And the albatross follows on. 
[01:59:00]  The mariner kills the bird of good omen.  His shipmates cry against what he's done.  But when the fog clears, they justify him.  And make themselves a part of the crime.  Uh.  Sailing on and on north across the sea.  Sailing on and on and north to all's calm.  The albatross begins its vengeance.  A terrible curse. 
[01:59:30]  A thirst has begun.  His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner.  About his neck, the dead bird is up.  And the, uh, the shit curse goes on and on and on.  It does C-D-E-N-F or something.  And the thirst goes to get on.  Nobody has no water.  And then for them and me.  Day after day.  Day after day.  We stuck nor breath. 
[02:00:00]  Nor motion.  As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.  Water, water everywhere.  And all the boards did shrink.  Water, water everywhere.  Nor any drop to drink.  This song is the shit, though.  This is a great tune.  When it's not spoken like us.  The albatross!  The albatross!  It's all in the presentation.  Yeah.  Of course.  I think Dio's voice was deep. 
[02:00:30]  No, this is Bruce Dickinson.  Yeah.  Bruce Dickinson.  Sorry, sorry.  This bastard can belt out a tune.  Yes, he could.  But honestly, it might as well be Dio.  I mean, listen.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Damn.  I know.  Iron Maiden Thursday, man.  Yeah, we're going to play it out, but it's like a 14-minute song, unfortunately.  14 minutes?  14 minutes of this.  We can't do that to the people today. 
[02:02:00]  All right, you can figure that out.  This is crazy shit.  We do have a big breaking story, too.  Why don't we break and take care of some reeds?  Oh, what?  That's your breaking story?  That's a breaking story.  Wind breaking.  No, no, no.  What's the breaking story?  I don't know it yet.  Something's breaking.  No, no, no.  Someone has breaking news for the OPN thing.  So does.  I don't know.  Is this fake?  Do you get people to stay tuned?  Someone on the phone has breaking news. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Has a massive breaking story announcement to make on our show next.  Really?  What?  What?  What?  All right, we'll do that next.  What?  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Serious.  Serious.  XM.  We got Ian Halpern on the phone. 
[02:03:00]  I think today's the day he finally gives us a big, big, massive breaking story.  You think today's it?  I think so.  Now that he's been doing our show for like two or three years, I think today's finally  of the day that he gives us something real.  Right, Ian?  His Highness.  It's His Highness here.  Hello, His Highness.  Hello.  Hello.  Ah, yes.  What?  What?  Mekalekahai Mekahaini Ho.  Kung Yus His San Yem Bien Chou Shantan. 
[02:03:30]  Ah.  Merzidots and Dozidots and Little Lamsid Ivy.  Veseli Venocchi.  Bafangul Yu.  Shamos Magbarak.  Happy Hanukkah.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Of course.  All my Jewish, all the Jewish skanks out there that I banged over the years, big, happy  Hanukkah to you, too.  God.  That's sweet.  That's sweet, Ian.  I gave one of my chicks a menorah right up the ass, and she loved every second of it.  That's pretty hard. 
[02:04:00]  Those things are wide.  Yeah.  I'm making the best movie ever.  What?  The history of Hollywood right now.  I was wishing you guys happy holidays and Mandarin and Cantonese.  And this isn't my big scoop, but I've got to get in a shameless plug here.  Sure.  And my new movie's called Small Town Chinese Pussy that's going to be coming out.  That is not.  Yes, it is.  That is not the name of the movie.  Small Town Chinese Pussy.  Starring His Highness. 
[02:04:30]  It's my latest His Highness film.  And I've been traveling, man.  I've been in Bali.  Have you ever been to Gansu?  I've never been to Gansu.  No.  Where is that?  It's surrounded by the barren deserts.  It's an oasis town, beckons with sand dunes.  It's just beautiful.  Is it like somewhere Indiana Jones would go?  I think it's a bit more primitive.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Can we Google image this place?  Yeah.  Gansu. 
[02:05:00]  G-A-N-S-U.  Gansu.  Gansu.  This is where you were?  That was a villain from Star Trek.  How's the pussy in Gansu?  The Gansu?  Sideways.  Well, it's all in the movie, man.  I mean, while you guys are slaving away behind the microphone, I'm eating Chinese food 24-7.  Wow.  Is it good?  It's the best, man.  Have you gotten diarrhea?  America is just one big fucking brothel right now.  That's why I've been traveling in China.  Gansu looks like a shithole. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, come on.  We're Google imaging it.  I think the ancients live there.  Right.  The elders.  The elders and the ancients.  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  It has, per capita in the world, the most amount of virgins.  And that's why I went to Gansu.  What?  Because when I left the town...  Spock, explain.  The demographic has changed completely, because it's all Chinese small-town pussy, man.  I'm telling everyone listening to this show, there's nowhere better to go in the world than Gansu to get laid. 
[02:06:00]  Now, but you've really got only one type of girl to choose from, and that would probably be Asian.  Yeah, well, have you ever popped a Chinese cherry, Anthony?  No, I cannot say I have ever been with an Asian girl.  So you're telling His Highness right now, don't give me a lesson on Chinese cherry.  Oh, I'm not. I'm not, sir.  I've just done a movie about the Chinese cherry.  Sir, I never would try to say that, because I am not experienced in the ways of the Chinese pussy.  Well, I think you've got to open up and broaden your horizons, man, 
[02:06:30]  because all you've been doing is dating a bunch of American skanks who are just trying to embezzle you.  How many lawsuits have you got against you right now for sexual harassment?  Knockwood, none, my friend. None.  I'm a gentleman, Your Highness. I am a gentleman.  I know you're a gentleman.  I treat girls lovelily.  I know the chicks, man, they line up and, you know, they bend over backwards for you.  Is that it?  But you've got to broaden out, man, I told you. You've got to go to China. 
[02:07:00]  I like white girls of certain ages.  Nothing like Chinese cherry.  No.  No.  Is Norton there today?  I am, sir. How are you?  Norton.  Hey, Norton.  Have you ever popped a Chinese cherry, Norton?  No, I've had very, very little sexual interaction with Asian girls.  Except for hand movement.  Yeah, I mean, even that. I prefer white girls.  Yeah, I have not popped a cherry. 
[02:07:30]  I don't like virgins at all.  I don't like the dumb look on their face, the surprise.  I don't like that.  I don't like wiping blood on my dick on the fucking sheets.  Having to explain what just happened and what pills I'll now have to take so sores don't appear.  I don't like any of it.  Give me a dirt bag.  Give me a white dirt bag.  The spiny pinnacles of Chinese cherry, man.  There's nothing like it.  I'm glad you like it.  I pulled back up to the airport, I kid you not, in the movie in a wheelchair, man. 
[02:08:00]  Why? You had fucked yourself into a wheelchair?  I fucked the whole town.  Well, you're fucking the whole audience.  I had all these Chinese men after me because it's a big sin in Gansu.  Oh, they like you too?  You're going to carry before you bullshit at the altar.  Oh, see?  So they don't like that you were going around fucking there.  They're trying to ban the movie.  And we've been Google imaging for the last five minutes.  It's a shithole.  We haven't found one good picture, Ian. 
[02:08:30]  You haven't found a good picture?  Dude.  All right, a pagoda.  I see a pagoda.  How about do a Gansu woman Google image?  It's Gansu.  Let's see what the women look like.  Don't take my word for it.  Has any of your listeners ever been to Gansu?  Let's get somebody on the line.  What the hell?  I don't think anyone's ever been to Gansu.  Per capita, the most amount of virgins in the world per capita.  No one knows where Gansu is, never mind been there.  Right. 
[02:09:00]  Well, you're going to watch the movie.  They're all covered with SARS masks.  Every picture we have, the women and men, everybody is walking around with SARS masks on.  They can't suck your cock if they got that mask on, I mean.  Oh, and then there's old Mama-san.  That looks like the one that was with the one-legged hopping kid from Platoon.  I bet she runs the whole show.  Google Earth Manzuli.  M-A-N-Z.  Did you fuck up for Manny and Sal?  Here's the massive breaking news, by the way. 
[02:09:30]  We're talking about Gansu.  This is the massive breaking news.  I have two big news clips for you today.  Did you tell everyone else before us, like you usually do?  Well, one of them's already been broken, you know, and I fucked up on this one because  I emailed Travis and he said maybe I should come on yesterday.  And I missed the boat again because this one just broke a few minutes ago.  And I was just in transit yesterday, but one of them's out the window, the Stern story.  I would have broke it yesterday that he re-signed with your station for five years. 
[02:10:00]  I like the I would have, Ian, broken a story.  I have a witness here.  Travis knows that I...  But, Ian, we all knew yesterday.  Nobody knew yesterday.  There was a buzz around this whole place yesterday that it went down.  I knew first.  How would you know first?  Listen, I've been on Howard's show many times, and I have good sources there, and, you know,  I just have been following this story from the get-go.  There's a story that's going to happen tomorrow. 
[02:10:30]  It's going to be pretty big.  And I know it now, but I'm not going to say it until tomorrow, by the way.  I'm just letting you know.  I hear you, man, but you've never been to Gansu.  No, I have not.  And I'm willing to pay your ticket to Gansu.  I want to go to Gansu.  It's a one-way ticket.  So what's the big news?  What's the big news?  I'm going to hitchhike back.  Right.  Yeah, what's the big scoop?  Oprah Winfrey.  Okay, what's the scoop?  She isn't a lesbian, right?  No.  The Barbara Walters. 
[02:11:00]  Have you been following this Barbara Walters?  Yes, we have.  Yeah, we already played the audio.  We played some audio.  Why?  What's up?  What's up?  And let me ask you a question before I break this.  Do you think Oprah's gay?  I always did think she was gay.  And then listening to her explanation yesterday, I believed her because she sounded to me like  somebody who really wasn't gay.  But it wouldn't surprise me if she was.  So you're not answering the question.  I'm being honest.  I'm telling you, I really don't know.  Do you think she's not after hearing the audio she did with Barbara Walters? 
[02:11:30]  I believed her explanation.  I mean, to be very honest, I believed her that she wasn't, but it wouldn't surprise me if I was wrong.  So you're still swooning over those tears and that whole heart-to-heart caboodle with Barbara Walters?  Well, she said that her little friend there, what's her name?  Gail Kay.  Gail is like a mother to her.  She's been like a mother, a sister, a friend, you know, just everything to her.  Yeah, and, you know, this is a woman, Oprah Winfrey.  Or do you think she's ever gone down on Gail? 
[02:12:00]  I don't know.  Do I think?  I would never jerk off to it.  Just give me a hunch.  Like, seriously.  I think during their...  They're formidable.  I think during their long time that they've spent together, there was probably an evening where they were alone,  maybe a little wine or something, and things happened.  But that's just my personal opinion based on my knowledge of girls and what happens when they are alone drinking wine.  And they've known each other a while, and there's not a dick to be found. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  They usually wind up, you know, scissoring or something, which is ridiculous.  Finger-popping each other.  Well, you're getting warm.  You're getting warm now.  I am.  What about Opie?  So getting hard.  Opie, what's your gut on this one, Oprah?  My gut is she...  There's two things going on.  And I think she's either a lesbo, or she's one of those I don't like either.  Like asexual?  Yeah.  Like a fezzy?  Yeah, like a fezzy type.  Does Oprah look like she's good in the sack? 
[02:13:00]  No.  Holy shit.  No.  After all this buildup, she better be a Martian.  She's never spewed sexuality in all those years.  Right.  Not a one-time.  You're hearing it here first.  You're hearing it comes.  And this is straight from a good buddy who's an ABC producer of mine.  Ian Halpern.  Those tears are fake.  Ah.  And she faked the funk with those tears on Barbara.  It was all premeditated.  There were glycerin drops that she was carrying and rubbed in her eyes. 
[02:13:30]  And I'm sure Norton would know this.  I mean, you know, in films, how do you think they make, you know, people cry so easily?  Play this call for them.  Have this on a loop.  Well, you think of something sad.  Everyone knows that.  Yes.  And the tears come easy.  She took the chemical approach.  Really?  And I'm going on record for that.  But wouldn't Barbara Walters know that trick at this point? 
[02:14:00]  You know, Barbara Walters, first of all, she's practically senile at this point.  And she doesn't care.  As long as she gets the guests, she lets them do whatever the F they want to do.  And Oprah Winfrey, she's giving an hour or two.  She doesn't care.  You know, she wanted to make this the more drama, the better.  She's just after ratings still.  And bottom line, again, is I'm telling you right now, she took the chemical approach.  So you're saying that she took some kind of chemicals, put it in her eyes to make her eyes sting, burn, and made tears come out of them. 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  You know, there's two ways to do this with the chemical approach.  You could rub a menthol stick under your eyes.  Some cut onions.  That's the old way.  But these glycerin drops were seen on the set.  And that's how she did it.  I hear they also, on movie sets, use, like, small fans.  And then they drop, like, some menthol in that.  And then the wind blows into your eyes with this menthol-y thing and just makes you start crying. 
[02:15:00]  I used to do what Caligula did.  I have Drusilla hold an onion.  And I put my face into it.  And then I continue to speak.  Oh, I thought you got lard in a fist up your ass.  No, he was the giver of that to Proculus.  That's when Jimmy has to laugh if they do that.  Because he wanted to.  Because he wanted to fuck Livia.  And he was also jealous that Proculus had a full head of hair.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Open your eyes, Proculus.  Proculus.  And later he cut Proculus's, he had Proculus tortured, and he had his cock cut off and thrown to dogs. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, you're not getting that back.  Oh, boy.  You don't want to be on his shit list.  No.  Colleagues in the house.  Ian.  Cut off your dick.  I got more.  All right, he's got more.  This Ian Halpern, we've got to take it very seriously today.  Big allegations.  Oprah Winfrey cried on Barbara Walters, but it was fake.  And it was fake.  She took the chemical approach.  She wanted to be very dramatic to make it look like she definitely isn't a lesbo.  What else you got on this Ian Halpern? 
[02:16:00]  First off, Anthony, I want you to come to Gansu with me.  Enough about Gansu.  Gansu.  Gansu.  You're never going to go white again, dude.  Well, I doubt it.  I like white.  No, you're never going white again, man.  I love white.  All right.  What else you got on the Oprah Winfrey?  You think she's a lesbo?  I got three for you.  Three big scoops.  Elizabeth Edwards.  Hey, what about...  Oh, no.  Don't tell me she's not doing well.  Hold on, Ian.  So do you think Oprah Winfrey is a lesbian? 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  She's definitely had dalliances with women, and I know that for a fact.  So why don't you be the guy that gets it out there?  Because Kitty Kelly did a good job.  I respect Kitty Kelly.  But I did do...  If you go to my blog and Google Oprah Winfrey, read my post right now.  IanUndercover.com.  And in the search bar, type in Oprah, and you'll see a whole post I did about her being gay.  Oh, okay.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  Good plug for your website.  So that info was already up there.  There you go.  All right.  What else you got there, sir?  Elizabeth Edwards.  Yeah.  Toy boy.  And that's going to emerge in the tabloids in the next couple of weeks.  She had a toy boy the last few months of her life.  Or a boy toy.  What a boy toy?  A guy that wanted to have sex with a cancer victim?  He was a hospice nurse.  She was still horny until the day she died, and that's why I respect her.  You know, you've got to go out in style, and she definitely did.  Wouldn't that be John Edwards' camp?  Because Edwards looks like the biggest piece of shit in the world right now. 
[02:17:30]  He is.  He is.  He is.  So wouldn't they float that story like, look, she wasn't innocent?  Number two.  I still say Barry Obama has let down this country.  I think we do better with Osama than Obama at this point.  But, you know, putting a guy named Hussein in there makes no sense.  But I put Barry Obama number one, John Edwards number two.  It worked out very well.  Her boy toy was Captain Hook.  Well, here's the demographic of the boy toy. 
[02:18:00]  I like that.  There's some guy named Grim R.  Gary Reaper.  Why did I say that?  Here's your hook.  Here's your Captain Hook.  Oh, yes, yes, yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Because I've done some research on him.  Yes, sir.  23 years old, jobless, and gay.  And just extorting the shit out of her.  Fucking her for cash.  The last few months of her life.  Wow.  Was his name serious?  Make sure you're not serious. 
[02:18:30]  Shit.  So now, who is it?  It's a kid, small-town kid, Louisiana.  He's going to murder, as I said, in the next couple of weeks, you'll be reading all about  this, but a boy toy.  Well, who is he?  So we can have him now, and we can have it up front.  I've got to give you the name, because, you know, I'm going to break this story.  And, you know, pay my Gansu pussy, because I owe some money in China. 
[02:19:00]  That's why I'm back now for a bit.  We all do.  I'm busking on your show today.  Political joke.  Anything else that is a huge story, Ian?  Yes, yes.  On the Opie meter, what am I batting today so far?  On the Opie meter?  What?  That's the most critical meter.  Is it?  As far as Ian goes, yeah. 
[02:19:30]  I don't mind if Ian rambles about Gansu or anything.  Well, what did he say?  Oh.  So, so far, he said that Oprah rubbed some kind of chemical in her eye to make herself cry,  so she could really dispel this lesbian thing.  And then she said, then he said, he said that Edwards had a little boy toy right up until  she died, which was, you know.  Well, I met at the Oprah thing, because he already wrote the blog before he called us.  Well, no one reads his blog, so it's pretty much a breaking story right there. 
[02:20:00]  We're all about the exclusive.  All right, J-Lo.  Oh, here's the exclusive.  J-Lo.  Okay, we all know.  Dude, I heard she's talking about a TV deal or something.  J-Lo, first of all, we know she linked this L'Oreal deal, the new Facebook.  Bottom line, her and Anthony, it's just a relationship of convenience now, and they will announce their  split shortly.  Shortly being longer than six months or shorter than six months?  I'd say within six months. 
[02:20:30]  Within six months.  Okay, so we are looking for a J-Lo divorce, or split, at least, separation?  Yeah, and you're going to see some sex tapes emerge of J-Lo now from her ex.  From what ex?  One of the ex-husbands.  Oh, one of the exes?  Yeah, the first husband.  Oh, well, that's juicy.  Like her ass.  Like her ass, right.  Oh, well, Ian, well, well, we're going to keep our eyes and ears. 
[02:21:00]  After P. Diddy was in there?  J-Lo's ass was always way too big for me.  That's a little destroyed now.  Even a younger J-Lo, that ass was kind of threatened.  It was scary.  It was intimidating, I should say.  Danny likes the ass as well.  O'Janny Noah.  Huh?  I like it.  O'Janny Noah.  Yeah.  He's going to release some sex tapes.  Oh, really?  Yes.  How do you know that?  I know it for a fact.  For a fact?  Are we hearing this first, or is this already out there? 
[02:21:30]  The O'Janny's bit, well, you're hearing the split first.  Yeah.  All right, the split.  There's been rumblings about O'Janny's videos the last few weeks here and there.  But you're hearing the split first.  It's totally relationship convenience.  And I'll tell you one thing, J-Lo.  She can't get enough cock, man.  Really?  She ain't getting it.  Where is she looking, that she can't get enough?  She likes it hard, man.  She likes, you know, she likes something. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, it's like sold out.  Yeah, she likes the sausage to be primo.  And this guy's got a small dick, Mark Anthony.  Yeah?  You know, she likes the Congo style.  Oh, she likes the big, thick rod.  Yes, yes.  She likes, you know, the Chili Davis style.  Ah, big, okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's interesting.  If that does happen now in the next six months or so, you definitely have some crowing to do. 
[02:22:30]  Hold on.  With that, we go to Joe in Buffalo.  Joe?  Yo, hey.  Yeah, Joe, how you doing?  Shut up.  Joe, have you ever been to Gansu?  That was already out that J-Lo had sex tapes from her first husband.  Joe, Joe, take a breather here.  Have you ever been to Gansu?  You just enoysed everyone.  I want to off you off a free trip to Gansu.  Never good with the callers and Ian.  That's why I love him.  I know.  I'm going to go to Gansu today. 
[02:23:00]  You just enoysed everyone.  I'm not paying for someone's trip to Gansu with his highness.  All right, thank you.  And we're going to fuck as many.  All right, hey, hey, let's go to Chad in California.  Everyone has questions for you.  Chad.  Hey, hey.  Hey, ask him when the big epidemic in California, Southern California, these stricken people  are some bullshit like that.  Oh, yeah.  Wasn't there supposed to be?  Yeah, what happened with the epidemic in California then?  It became a worldwide epidemic.  If you've been following the fucking news, we're all about to die. 
[02:23:30]  Ah, shut up.  Whatever.  I just spoke two weeks ago in front of the California Chamber of Commerce.  The senator was in the front row.  So they fucking flew me first class there to give a speech.  It was Schwarzenegger's former advisor, chief of staff.  Flew me out.  And I'm like, it was their annual retreat.  I didn't fucking put one note together.  I didn't even do any research.  I got hammered on the plane.  I wanted to bang the stewardess in first class.  And she told me to calm down before she calls the cops. 
[02:24:00]  But anyhow, I got up there.  The stiff before me from the L.A. Times, he had them yawning.  And his highness doesn't prepare one fucking note.  But I went for 90 minutes, got a standing ovation, and got laid right after the show.  That's beautiful.  That's an accomplishment.  Let's go to Detroit.  Todd in Detroit.  You're on with Ian Halpern, breaking all sorts of stuff today for us.  You better make it good, Todd.  Otherwise, I want a machine gun on the air.  And you better start dancing, because you're going to be gone. 
[02:24:30]  Make it good, bro.  Why are you reading us the AOL news?  Oh, come on.  Dude, can't you do better than that?  Your jokes are so fucking old.  Okay.  While you're sitting at home, let's talk about your gay getaway that you keep talking about.  Young Asian boys?  Young Asian boys?  What's the matter, Ian?  You're going to lose a fistfight with a white guy?  Hold on.  Let me talk here.  My demographic is plain and simple. 
[02:25:00]  Chinese cherry popping for women, 98 and over, with minimum $50 million in the bank.  That's my demographic for chicks I got to date.  Okay, well, my definition is sex crime.  All right, let me go to Adam in Delaware.  Everyone wants it.  Adam.  Yo, buddy, what's up?  Ian, shut the fuck up.  Seriously, you're a fucking idiot.  You're full of shit.  You're just here for fucking fun.  We're here to laugh at you, you douchebag.  Yeah, that's why you're fucking on my picture in front of your computer right now. 
[02:25:30]  No, I picture your mom's fucking in front of my computer.  You remind me why I don't want to fuck it.  You are fantasizing, you homo, about licking my crack.  But only Chinese chicks get into his highness's crack this day.  Have you ever fucked a woman over 98 with $50 million in the bank?  And all I'm saying is that Anthony told this guy all about it.  Obviously, he doesn't know.  Don't get me involved in this.  I like Ian.  Hey, hey, hey.  His highness is amazing. 
[02:26:00]  Adam, I gotta be honest.  Ian asked you a question.  Now, have you fucked a woman over the age of 98 with $50 million in the bank?  And I have.  That's why these guys are driving the way behind the microphone today.  And I'm in Gansu, fucking half the city.  Ah, wow.  All right, one more.  One more.  One more.  Bob and Georgia.  Two more.  Hey, Ian.  Congratulations, Gansu.  The last person on the fucking planet. 
[02:26:30]  You finally give everyone your bullshit.  You are a fucking turd.  Oh, fuck it.  Are you going to watch my movie?  Oh, he hung up.  Give me one more.  Give me one.  Everyone's a...  They're all haters, Ian.  They're all haters.  I got one for you.  JoJo in Philadelphia.  JoJo.  Did you see WikiLeaks just released Ian Halpert's sources?  It's fucking Entertainment Weekly and TMZ. 
[02:27:00]  How we all get our news.  Fucking trick.  Yeah, I love you, too, brother.  I don't have to go to fucking...  Go make your nine bucks an hour while I'm getting my crack-looking, Zach, and Sue.  Yeah, but the difference is I'm good-looking enough to get laid in the United States.  I don't have to go to some fucking third world country.  Don't have you realized every fucking chick in the States who dates you, they're fucking prostitutes, man.  Everybody and their uncle's been in them before you.  You've never popped a cherry in your life.  I guarantee you that. 
[02:27:30]  If you watch my new movie, I'm popping cherry.  Once again, your sources are wrong.  When was the last time you popped a cherry, sweet pie?  Sweet pie, I'm sorry.  I'm not into your type there, fella.  Yeah, when was the last...  Whose cherry did you pop last?  A few in high school, man.  You're not your daughters, you fucking scumbag.  All right, we're going to move on to Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey, Ian, how are you getting laid so much in China with the lack of fat chicks there? 
[02:28:00]  I'll tell you, man, fat chicks are good.  And one of the chicks in my movie, she's about 200 pounds,  and there's nothing like banging a fat Chinese chick.  You know, I told her, listen, has there ever been a Chinese heavyweight champion?  No.  How do you know that?  Yokozuma?  We know that.  There's no way to answer that.  We just know.  Ian, also, if American chicks are so easy, how come you can only get that one chick to show up to your bed in? 
[02:28:30]  Hey, no, I'll tell you, that was only one on air, but there were many more there.  And I'll tell you, there's nothing like...  Seriously, brother?  Yeah.  There's nothing like banging a 200-pound chick.  Nothing?  I'll do that right now.  Nothing like it.  Especially if you're popping the cherry.  All right.  Anthony, when was the last time you popped the cherry?  It's probably been many years ago.  No, but it used to be my forte back in high school.  I believe you.  I don't think I had anything but virgins until I was in my 20s. 
[02:29:00]  Wow, look at you.  Yes.  Nice.  If there's one person in the history of womankind, and you could take them back and put them in their virgin status, who would you pop?  One chick.  Dakota Fanning.  And Norton?  Norton?  He just takes that answer.  Norton doesn't feel like playing today.  Yeah, no.  Are you mad at me, Norton, today? 
[02:29:30]  No, no, not at all.  All right.  Look, man, I'm your biggest fan.  You know what?  Not at all.  I'm going to give you one that agrees with you there, Ian.  John in Georgia.  John.  Hey.  Hey, John.  What's up, guys?  Jimmy, you'd love China, man.  For about 1,000 RMB, they come to your hotel room, and they're there as long as you want, and they're prettiest, cutest, youngest.  I don't care.  I'm not into Chinese chicks.  That's like saying, hey, for a nickel, you can get a vat of leek soup.  I wasn't either until I left the China. 
[02:30:00]  Let me ask you a question.  Hey, how much for $40 worth of bouillabass?  Who fucking wants that shit?  You know, Google this one.  There's no sweeter pussy than the chicks of China.  What comes up when you Google it?  There's no sweeter pussy than the chicks of China.  I don't know.  Has anyone else fucked a Chinese chick out there?  Out there, I'm sure.  A lot of Chinese guys. 
[02:30:30]  You've never done one, Anthony?  Seriously?  Never.  I don't have the urge, or I just don't.  I'm not attracted.  I am very attracted to white girls.  Hey, let me do a favor.  If I get you a Chinese chick, okay, and cherry popping it all, will you just at least try it,  and then let me know if you're going to go back to the Caucasians?  This isn't a fucking taste test.  I'm not, uh...  It is a taste test.  I don't want to...  It is a taste test.  I know I'm not going to like it.  All right.  All right.  We'll say it's all a taste test. 
[02:31:00]  I don't...  I really...  I find white girls attractive.  All right.  Let me go to Mike in Iowa.  One more that wants to agree with you, and then we've got to move on, Ian.  Yes.  Yes.  Mike...  Yeah, who's this fuck-tard kid?  He's not fucking anybody.  He's a Canadian Jewish guy with a small dick.  We're not fooled.  No one's fucking you.  You want me to post a photo of my dick right now on, uh, on my blog?  You're one of those type of guys that when a woman wants a fucking picture of you...  Is that all you want is info about the physicality of his highness? 
[02:31:30]  No one's fucking you.  You want all the dick info on you, right?  Nobody is fucking you.  Have you ever worn a condom?  A Chinese condom?  I don't wear a condom.  I follow Jimmy's rules.  You don't wear a condom, dude, because you don't get it, man.  Have you ever banged a Chinese chick?  Because I'm a real man, like Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, when was the last time you got laid?  Two days ago. 
[02:32:00]  Two days ago, and who was it?  Uh, it was my girlfriend.  All right.  How long have you been with her?  Long enough?  What's long enough?  I...  What?  Maybe...  See, you know what I'm getting at here?  No.  You are living not curiously, dude, through his highness.  Just admit it.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was going there.  I don't like gay sex.  I'm not living through you.  Oh.  Do you ever fantasize about me? 
[02:32:30]  No, I don't.  Yes, you do.  That's why you're calling in.  Right or wrong?  Now, listen.  Go to the Gansu, and then let's have this conversation.  Okay.  He's gone, too.  Ian, I give you two huge thumbs up today.  Ah.  Thanks for having me, guys.  No problem.  Two huge thumbs up.  His Highness.  Do you watch the movie?  I don't even know what the movie's about.  I know it's about Gansu, I guess.  It's about popping Chinese cherry.  I'm going to look for that.  It's about small-town Chinese pussy. 
[02:33:00]  Can we Netflix that?  I don't think they got it.  I've never had more fun in my life making a movie.  Small-town Chinese pussy.  Thanks for inviting us.  You really went literal with the title.  Hey, we've got to be right to the point today.  You know?  Certainly are.  We've got to brand it properly.  And Oprah, those are fake tears.  Everyone watching the show, anyone, if anyone watches TV anymore, it's all an act.  I think the interview's tonight, so we'll look for the fake tears.  Yeah.  Please do.  And also, J-Lo's going to separate from her husband in the very near future. 
[02:33:30]  Six months, I guess.  Yes.  And all the other stuff has been all over the place for weeks.  Hey, Buttman's here.  Oh, Buttman's here.  We've got to go, Ian.  We've got Buttman here.  Peace out, everyone.  Thank you, Mr. Halpern.  Quick break, and then Buttman.  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius X. 
[02:34:00]  All right, moving right along.  What do we got next?  We got Buttman?  Where is he?  John, I told Roland to bring him down with me.  John Stagliano.  He said, bring him down when we come back from break.  What's the story of Buttman, Jimmy?  Yeah, give us a little background.  Please.  He's a legendary guy in porn.  He started the gonzo genre.  What is the gonzo genre?  I'm sure he'll have to explain it better than I can.  I remember Spaz liked the gonzo style. 
[02:34:30]  The gonzo style.  The gonzo style.  The gonzo style, right?  He was facing a lot of time in jail recently over charges of obscenity.  And it's like, you think that went away in this country.  I know.  And it's fucking...  There's one guy who's in jail now.  He got four years.  And he was facing a lot more time than that.  For what?  It's mind-boggling.  There shouldn't be anything that can't be delivered to adults that that isn't illegal.  I mean, it's not illegal, is it?  No.  It's crazy.  It's community standard shit.  It's the same shit they get us with.  Sure. 
[02:35:00]  Come on in.  Come on in.  Hey, John.  How are you?  Welcome to the show.  How are you, sir?  How are you?  Take a seat.  We've just been discussing quickly some of the problems with legalities of adult films  and how some people are actually going to jail.  And that's not a good thing.  We don't like that.  Yeah.  Max Hardcore is in jail right now.  Yeah.  It's a really...  Now, what is the actual charge that he's in jail for? 
[02:35:30]  He's in charge for obscenity.  Now, I didn't think that was illegal as long as it was being distributed to adults.  Yeah.  From what I understand, as far as what you guys are concerned, certainly you wouldn't  think it was illegal from what I've heard about what happens on the show.  Well, that's true.  We don't think a lot of things are illegal.  It's a very strange law that you don't know you're breaking it when you break it, which  makes it a really bad law.  Because a good law would say, okay, this is the law.  I'm not going to... 
[02:36:00]  I'm going to choose to break it or I'm not going to choose to break it.  Just in the process of making a movie with hardcore sex in it, that's been interpreted  as being prosecutable anywhere.  So I guess the theory is you're supposed to know that if you're making hardcore porn,  they can come and get you anytime they want.  But isn't it like, this is what bothers me, how did they actually get max and what did  they charge you with?  It wasn't like there was no underage girls used.  That's the thing to be...  Right, right.  That's the shit that should be illegal.  But there was nobody under the age of 18 used.  Nobody was forced. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Well, the principle is not somebody being forced or any First Amendment free speech  thing at all.  The principle is...  It's a...  My lawyer likes to say that there's a history of the blasphemy laws.  Like if you say something bad about the king or something, there's the principle that the  government can control your speech if you say something that offends people.  And in this case, it's really the disgust emotion, I think, that is aroused by certain  images that people aren't used to seeing.  But the truth of the matter is, the First Amendment does not protect people against 
[02:37:00]  being offended.  I mean, you can offend people with what you're doing, your art, it's not your right.  You don't have a right in this country to not be offended.  That's true.  You don't have a right to...  You would think that people would logically extend that.  But it's really a political thing.  The reason why I was prosecuted was because George Bush appointed a task force, an anti-obscenity  task force, and the job was to stop the proliferation of pornography, and that's what they 
[02:37:30]  were trying to do with me, and that's what they succeeded to do with Max.  Where would...  Now, it's always been a gray area, and of course, there was that famous quote, you know,  I know it when I see it.  Where is the line?  Where is the line between acceptable adult entertainment that is sold and no charges come  around, and adult entertainment that people would deem obscene?  Well, the fact that anybody even asks the question that there's a line.  Right.  Because there really shouldn't be a line. 
[02:38:00]  No.  Because people think differently than...  Individuals think differently across a broad spectrum.  Some people are very acceptable with gay marriage, and some people do not accept that at all.  Me and Jimmy are married.  Exactly.  In Massachusetts, we're very popular.  So, the thing is, nobody wants to think about what you two guys do in the privacy of your  own home.  They have no choice.  We tell them on the air.  Okay.  So, the...  I think it's... 
[02:38:30]  You guys are...  The thing is, some people want to be...  Oh, God.  You guys are fucking mean.  Anyway, some people just are able to go through the world and not...  And accept other people's different lifestyles.  Yeah, sure.  And that's just their personality.  And other people are brought up in a more rigid environment, and they're taught, I think,  by their parents.  And I think this is a natural tendency, to some extent, is that you judge people all the 
[02:39:00]  time.  You judge what other people do, because is this good for me?  Is this bad for me?  And then if you're taught that if something is bad, then it's okay to force somebody else  to not be bad, that that's a principle, that it's...  That, you know, your parents say that, you know, you can't do this bad thing, so you tell  your brother, you can't do that bad thing, and then you tell your neighbor, you can't  do that bad thing.  It's just a matter of acceptance.  You were facing...  What exactly...  What scene was it that they used to try to get you? 
[02:39:30]  Well, the worst was these girls squirting milk out of their butts into the faces and mouths  of these other girls.  It was...  That's fantastic.  That's just silly.  That really is just silly.  It's just silly.  I personally was very aroused by it.  So, what's the problem with...  Milk out of the...  Was that a Joey scene?  These girls were supposed to be a beautiful ass.  I just never like anything coming out of an ass.  Shit I can accept, but no milk.  It just looks far enough.  That's terrible.  Shit I can't accept.  It's like watching an alien shoot bubblegum. 
[02:40:00]  Everything is like...  You know, Jason shot this movie, and it's really beautifully lit, and the girls are dressed  very nice, and it's just a...  It's very clean and pristine.  Milk is splashing all over the place.  It just sounds fabulous.  There's something...  It cues things in your brain, in deep-seated, like, weird things, and people get off on  that.  It sounds like it's like looking at a Kubrick scene.  It's just nice and pristine.  That cues things in certain other people's brains, you know, or they want to see that 
[02:40:30]  kind of violence or whatever, and somehow they get off on it.  It's cathartic for them, and maybe they're less likely to commit violence after that,  because that's really what happens, is that when you repress people's real feelings and  what they want to look at, then that becomes something that festers inside of you, and it  could be expressed in an antisocial way.  The only arrestable scene I remember seeing is Jim Norton in Furry Vengeance.  That was really... 
[02:41:00]  That should have been prosecutable for impersonating an actor, and I really did technically steal  their money when I accepted payment for that horse shit.  I shot...  It was kind of like shooting milk out of an ass, except it was my dialogue and the thin  lips.  What's up?  Shooting the script out of an ass.  So they see this scene, and what do they do?  They say it's obscene by community standards, and what do they do?  How do you find out you're in legal trouble?  Well, the Justice Department decides to prosecute you. 
[02:41:30]  But did you get a call from a lawyer, or did they contact you, or...?  They released a press release, actually, the day before that they were going to file the  charges, and then they filed the charges in federal court.  That's frightening.  Wow.  I felt like immediately it's...  I called the lawyer, and the lawyers are involved, and they're talking to the Justice  Department.  They're talking about trial dates and all sorts of stuff, and I feel like I'm...  All of a sudden, now I'm thrust into this legal system.  I'm just minding my own business.  I'm not hurting anybody.  In fact, I'm doing the best I can to make sure that there's integrity at my company, 
[02:42:00]  and we do everything properly, and now these other people are stepping in, and they're  going to put me in jail, and they're forcing me to go.  And their morality is, from all I can see, it's purely based on other people's idea of  morality, and has nothing to really do with the legal system.  I don't get that.  I don't get where it goes from...  That's because you have a vision of the legal system as being this thing where you only are 
[02:42:30]  in trouble if you hurt somebody.  I'm so naive.  That's somebody's rights.  No, the federal government has a huge number of laws, and they have a huge number of federal  prosecutors, and that's what they do all the time, is they make shit for the American people.  It's a really horrible thing.  There's all sorts of laws that are passed all the time.  That's what Congress does.  They pass laws.  It's really kind of a bad situation.  There's things there that we really don't know about until something happens to someone  like you, and...  Yeah, regulations on business, crazy little things.  You can't sell trans fats in New York or something like that. 
[02:43:00]  So somebody's like, you know, one of these guys on the street, you're going to arrest them.  It's insane.  How much time are you facing?  32 years maximum.  Practically 8 to 10, maybe.  Who knows?  If they had convicted me on everything, I might have gotten 10 years, something like that.  How many charges are there, though?  It's like...  It's funny, but Lenny Bruce, this is what they went after Lenny Bruce for.  It's the same thing.  I mean, back then it was, you couldn't say this, and now you can say what you want, but  pornography is...  You think like, wow, we sure thought crazy back then. 
[02:43:30]  It's a good thing, you know, we've progressed now to the point where we can figure out adults  want to see certain things.  They're consenting adults that are being paid to do something on film, and it's being kept  out of the hands of children, it's being marketed and sold to adults.  Where's the fucking crime?  Where's the problem?  Why can't we just be adults and mind our own business and watch things that we like without  the threat of being prosecuted?  It's beyond me.  Well, you know, in the national media, we talk about lifestyles and what's good and what's 
[02:44:00]  bad, and there's, you know, Mr. Dr. Phil, whatever his name is on TV telling us you should  behave this way or you shouldn't behave that way.  And people take that as an extension, like, you know, we should use the power of government  because the principle of the government controlling every part of our life has already been established  and it seems to be getting worse.  And people that want that in their lives are idiots.  I think anybody that sits there and thinks, because they always present, also the government 
[02:44:30]  will always present a law as something that they're helping you with or protecting you  from.  They never present something as, we're going to take this away from you anymore.  They realize that doesn't work.  Or we're imposing our morality.  They'll never say that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, this is the marriage protection law.  It's not the homosexual, fuck you, can't get married law.  It's, we're protecting traditional marriage.  And for this, it's like, look, we're protecting people from this horrible obscenity. 
[02:45:00]  And like, no, you're taking away a form of entertainment.  And if you want to say art to an extent to certain people, it's what they're taking away.  And the people that fall for that are just saps to me.  How much a year does porn make, would you say, as a whole?  I don't know if you have an exact figure, but you always hear it's by far the biggest seller  in video.  The business, what does it pull in a year?  Well, it's definitely gone down in the last, let's say, three years.  You know, DVD sales have gone down.  There's all sorts of free stuff on the internet, which has really trashed my business. 
[02:45:30]  We sell about 25% of what we used to sell.  We make more money on the internet now, but it hasn't come close to replacing what we've  lost.  But that amount, I don't know, it's in the billions.  Somebody told me once that porn, or I heard once in an outlet that porn generates more  income than the NFL or something like that, other forms of entertainment.  Are you worried about the internet?  Because obviously, the FCC is starting to look into it as far as regulation goes. 
[02:46:00]  Now, they say right now it's just pretty much bandwidth regulations and companies and stuff.  But once they get their mitts on something, I mean, you look at radio, they initially were  just in radio to make sure they were on the right frequencies years ago.  That's what the FCC was for.  And then all of a sudden, they're regulating content.  Are you concerned about that?  I am concerned about it, but I consider the internet to be a fabulous, incredible thing  that's happened to people.  Yeah, believe me. 
[02:46:30]  I love it, too.  We can spread information so easily and quickly.  Information and semen.  Knowledge.  And the government has less of a chance to get away with shit, like this whole WikiLeaks  thing that's going on.  I think that this guy's a hero to put this stuff on the internet.  Did you see what they did?  A lot of the supporters that are hackers, they're starting to hack into Visa, MasterCard's  websites, denial-of-service viruses.  PayPal, because they all denied him.  It's something that you can't do something on the internet without consequences, regardless 
[02:47:00]  of who you are.  Like, you can't just make a law and you'll get off scot-free and that law works, because  you'll have these underground people that will do denial-of-service attacks on a website  as retribution against going against somebody like WikiLeaks.  So it is still kind of the Wild West, like we've always talked about.  Well, yeah.  This is what disturbs me, too.  It's like, first of all, how long did your process last, and how much did you spend in  legal fees?  I know you spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, it was somewhere between $800,000 and a million.  I haven't actually added it up.  If you start from day one, it probably is about a million dollars.  But there's no way to get that back?  Never.  I can't.  I mean, unless I could prove that they did something unethical.  The prosecutors, which we know 100% the prosecutor lied.  I mean, there are lots of contradictory things that happened during the trial, and prosecutors  just do that routinely.  But we can't really prove that.  We can't prove misconduct, so we can't get any money back. 
[02:48:00]  What did they say you did wrong?  I sold a movie that is obscene, and obscenity is, you can't sell something that's obscene.  We understand it's a gray area, that obscene thing.  Yeah, it's obscenity is to be...  What in your particular movie?  I sold a movie called Milk Nymphos.  That was the one where the girls were spraying milk out of their butts.  And that's all it was?  Yeah, that movie, I sold that DVD.  Actually, I sold it to an FBI agent who ordered it, who actually ordered it into a post office 
[02:48:30]  in Washington, D.C.  He picked it up there from there, and he took it to Virginia and watched it there, and  never even watched it in D.C., and they prosecuted him in D.C.  That's another thing.  Oh, wow.  But the other movie, two movies, the other movie was done by Joey Silvera.  It's called Storm Squirters.  Actually, this was Storm Squirters 2, and I think it was the subtitle that really got  it, was Storm Squirters 2 Target Practice, which is, because these girls are like squirting  when they come, and it's a little bit like pee.  Maybe it is partly pee.  I don't know, but one girl was sitting on a chair about 10 feet away from another girl, 
[02:49:00]  and she lines it up.  And they only played one scene from each movie in the thing, and they definitely played the  scene where the girl is sitting on a chair, and she's playing with herself, and then she  sends this stream off about 10 feet into this girl's face, and she's got her hands together  like she's praying in church.  I thought it was beautiful.  So, arousing in perverse and interesting ways, and sorry if I'm getting aroused by that,  but that was...  See, like, no problem with that.  Whose business is it?  We did that bit on the radio. 
[02:49:30]  Like, if the...  We did.  With Big A, remember?  Yeah, he got it right in the face.  That's right.  Right in the face.  Oh, my God.  It looked like this Bruder film.  Yeah.  It was great.  Said there were no brains to be splattered.  It just amazes me that he ordered it with the specific purpose to get a case against you.  Now, if he hadn't ordered it, he wouldn't have seen it.  See, this is my whole thing.  Why don't we have the freedom as adults in this country to purchase something we want 
[02:50:00]  to purchase, watch it, enjoy it, and be left alone?  If they're going out of their way to order something, they just didn't have to order it.  They didn't have to be offended.  That's true.  Right.  And the only people forced to watch these movies...  It's forcing themselves to offend themselves.  The only people forced to watch these movies were the jurors in Washington, D.C.  Right.  Now, they were forced...  Nobody else has ever been...  By the government.  Yes.  They were forced to be offended by these movies.  They were.  They didn't ask to watch them. 
[02:50:30]  They were forced to watch them.  Meanwhile, any other time people are ordering these, they're not ordering these thinking  it's a Pixar movie.  They know what they're getting.  Am I...  Dude, it's disgusting.  We all talk about free speech and being allowed to do what you want to do.  But Max is in jail.  And look, what Max does is tasteless to a lot of people, but it's not...  It should not be illegal.  Not to the girls.  I'm sure they're tasting something.  Yes, but they're not enjoying it.  It's just funny to watch a Max movie.  It really is like a fun...  It's like something you see on fucking, like, ogrish.com. 
[02:51:00]  Yes, it really is.  But he shouldn't be in jail.  Did we actually explain what he did wrong, that he's in jail for?  He did something that was decided to be obscene by the standards of the people in Tampa, Florida.  And because Tampa, I guess, might have had the servers that had his websites on it, that  wasn't clear.  And they decided that, well, because the content somehow is here, even though people aren't  looking at it here necessarily, or maybe some people are, I'm sure.  How many obscenity...  Wait, but what did he do?  Yeah, what exactly did he...  What did he do?  Like, what was the scene that they said, that's the one? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, that's the one...  There were like five movies, and they did a little bit rougher sex.  There was some peeing involved, and it's just, you know...  The interesting thing that...  Max did mouth urination, too, and stuff like that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He was pretty dirty.  He developed this...  Can I just talk about anything?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sure, sure, sure.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Well, he developed the skill of having a heart on and being able to pee at the same  time.  That's a talent.  We all wish we could do that in the morning.  Yeah, well, that's when I was younger, maybe.  Max is...  No one's ever got more pleasure out of their dick than Max Hardcore. 
[02:52:00]  That guy's dick never went down in a scene.  Really?  He was the greatest.  He'd have on little brown shoes, and he would just talk with a weird, like, Minnesota accent.  There we go.  He's the greatest.  The one thing that I always remember is a girl told me, well, yeah, I work for Max Hardcore.  How could he ever hurt me with a dick that size?  He wasn't very big.  No, you might have a five, right?  And he was a little bit rough, but it was, like, you know, not a very dangerous thing.  Yeah, there's a little pee in there.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, we got some Max Hardcore right now.  He's doing four years.  Oh, wow.  But he kind of... 
[02:52:30]  He invented kind of that whole face-fuck, brutal...  Yeah, really, girl gagging.  That was very Max.  I have to say, he should get some credit for that.  I don't disagree.  I mean, it was being done by people on occasion in other places, but he was the one who  brought that art form, so to speak.  The government's giving him credit for it.  Yeah, and, you know, we laugh about it, but people pushing themselves to the limits and  enjoying themselves in really interesting and creative ways, that's valuable to the human  race.  What Max Hardcore did was valuable to the human race, and I enjoy it, and I enjoyed watching 
[02:53:00]  it.  Now, I didn't enjoy the misogynistic stuff that he did and some of that thing.  I would fast forward through that.  Well, there's obviously a lot of material that everybody would have a problem with in, I  think, any adult movie.  You're going to watch and go like, oh, well, it's not my cup of tea.  It's not my cup of jizz.  Yeah, you know, I'm offended by children going to church.  Actually, I know that sounds really bizarre, but, you know, kids being taught that faith  is important, which means suspending your reason and your reason capacity. 
[02:53:30]  I think that's obscene.  I think telling kids that there are some things in life that you just can't understand, that  you have to just accept, that's evil.  That's really bad.  And you have to now base your life on those kind of fantasy aspects of what's going to  be afterwards.  So now you're, in my opinion, wasting some of the things you can do or guilting yourself  too much in some pleasurable things that life has to offer because of this fantasy that 
[02:54:00]  might await you at the end of the rainbow.  It's, uh, yeah, well, those virgins that those guys, well, yeah, yeah.  So I'm sure they're, well, because if you get, they're still looking for their dicks,  nevermind using, if you get convicted for obscenity, like Max did, it's like, what's  to say that gay porn is an obscene or look, cause it is going to come around and what's  to say that like, you know, what a comedian is saying is an obscene thing.  Yeah, makes me, it really is fucking frightening.  It's like, you know, you never hear when you hear slippery slope arguments, it was like, 
[02:54:30]  where were all the free speech advocates at the ACLU and all of these fucking phony politicians  that are complaining about TSA screenings, where were all these people defending you  publicly?  Yeah.  It is an invasion of privacy too.  It's an invasion of, of, uh, uh, privacy.  You're watching these movies, you're producing these movies and you know who your, your audience  is and your customer base.  You're not forcing anyone to watch these.  Well, there was this thing that my lawyers kept saying, this is don't say you made money  on it. 
[02:55:00]  Don't say it's a really bad.  If you say you made money on this stuff, like, so it's like, that's a big negative thing  to say.  It's like you guys are actually making money over being a little bit on the edge, right?  I don't know how on the edge I've heard.  Used to.  We're actually making a little, not making a lot of money being a little on the edge,  making a little money being a lot on the edge.  But the fact that you're making money, that's the evil thing.  Yeah, that is evil.  You know, which, you know, making money simply means for most of the economy, not unless you're  ripping somebody off, but when you're not ripping somebody off, it just means you're, you're  giving something, people something that they choose to take instead of something else, 
[02:55:30]  which means you've created value in their lives.  That's what making money is.  What's to stop them from coming after you again?  Because that's what they do is they target you and they just fuck you legally and they  know you have to pay for your lawyers.  So like, what, what's to stop them from coming after you again on another film?  Yeah, they outbid you.  Right now, except for the fact that they were embarrassed a little bit, I think that their  case was not handled as well as maybe they'll do it the next time.  They'll probably do it better if they come after me and I have to worry about that.  And how, how long ago is this?  This was this summer in July.  It was this summer? 
[02:56:00]  It was a fun time in Washington, D.C. with 103 degrees, I think it was one day.  It was really interesting.  So now, what are you doing differently in your movies?  Anything?  What am I doing differently in my movies?  You guys, Evil Angel kind of, let me just tell you, is kind of like a company over other  companies that kind of...  I am a company that sells the movies of like 14 other directors and I don't own their movies.  I keep a percentage of the gross sales.  Okay.  But I help them package the movie, but the directors have to pay for that packaging and 
[02:56:30]  all that stuff and then I sell that.  It makes it so that if they do a really good movie, they keep all the profits and stuff.  There's only one or two companies...  It's like Porno Amway.  Yeah.  Well, I allow my directors a certain degree of freedom.  However, we have certain standards.  I don't like misogynistic movies.  I don't like woman-hating movies.  There are some companies that they build on treating women badly and that's an interesting  fantasy that the sexual dynamic, like what Max Hardcore does or whatever, works for some 
[02:57:00]  people to do that and I'm not going to condemn them.  I just personally would rather not sell that kind of movie.  And that's how it should be.  Yeah.  Whatever I personally don't want it.  Right.  You personally don't want it, so you don't do that.  And if someone wants to watch it, that's fine.  If they don't, that's fine too.  I don't understand how they can call something even obscene.  I don't know where, again, where that line is.  How many obscenity charges are brought against anything, anyone else? 
[02:57:30]  Are there any against comedians these days or anything?  Was it Lenny Bruce?  Lenny was.  Yeah, but I mean, in this day and age, is it just adult films that are being targeted?  That they use the obscenity law?  Yeah.  I think so, yeah.  Because, I mean...  You know, there's a definition of the obscenity law.  There is.  Yeah, there's a three-pronged thing where you have to show that it's totally...  Well, God, I can't even remember.  Is it devoid of any human value or devoid of any value to the community? 
[02:58:00]  That's a little subject.  Devoid of any value was actually eliminated from the law, and now they have to show that...  And Jimmy would be obscene.  It appeals to a purient interest, and then everybody has to run for a dictionary and trying to define...  And finally a purient, yeah.  And then it's defined in case law, whatever, an unhealthy interest in sex, which is why they picked those two movies.  Unhealthy. Again, again, very subjective, based on whose findings of healthy sex.  It doesn't seem like any of this... 
[02:58:30]  Like, if it was any other trial for any other charge, murder, manslaughter, robbery, burglary,  it would be thrown out just based on the vagueness of the law itself.  Exactly.  Yet they could hold you responsible for something that just really doesn't have a defined definition.  Well, they also, too, it's like, by charging you with obscenity...  They couldn't charge a comedian these days with obscenity, because people would come to your defense publicly. 
[02:59:00]  They would look like completely archaic assholes by doing that.  They'd be humiliated.  But nobody comes to the public defense.  It's better when Democrats are in office for stuff like this, but even a Democrat liberal is not going to come to the defense publicly of pornography.  They just won't.  Like, who publicly defended you?  Well, the Reason Foundation, there are libertarian...  Oh, did they defend you?  Yeah, and other libertarian organizations, or the libertarian idea, and then other people in the press,  that were definitely thinking that this was a crazy prosecution, that this should not happen. 
[02:59:30]  A lot of the liberal press was defending me also.  Did you feel abandoned by anybody?  Did I feel abandoned by anybody?  My country?  My first girlfriend.  I just can't get over that.  She had an incredible ass.  Unbelievable.  And she completely...  I was a wimp back then.  I didn't know.  I mean, I would have abandoned me, too.  But this time, the libertarians actually came.  I thought the libertarians left you hanging.  There were some organizations that were a bit more conservative that didn't say much. 
[03:00:00]  I think one of them said a little bit at the end.  I'm not going to name names.  But their base is more conservative, and I'm not conservative at all.  Now, when you get movies in from these directors that you're going to help distribute the movie,  are you a little more gun-shy now?  Do you look and go like, I don't want to get in that jam-up again?  Yeah, there's probably something like that in the back of my mind. 
[03:00:30]  But we sell the same stuff that we've always been selling.  It's not obscene.  I have to say that.  My lawyers tell me you have to say that.  It's not obscene.  Even though we can't tell what obscene is.  It's not obscene.  But it's not.  Because supposedly they could, like, replay this radio thing.  See, you said it was obscene.  Oh, God.  Oh, really?  Okay, sorry.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Well, that's lawyers.  Lawyers are always trying to protect you, like, in the worst-case scenario.  Say, don't do anything, you know.  We hate lawyers here.  If I was still...  You know, this thing was going on for two and a half years. 
[03:01:00]  They filed charges in April of 2008.  I don't think the judge wanted to hear this.  He knew this was a bad law.  And the judge, who...  But he actually ruled against this in almost every turn that he could.  He made it really, really hard for us.  But in the end, he could see that I had really good professional lawyers who were just so much  better than the prosecution team.  And we had our shit together, so to speak.  And it must have taken him aback, too, that you walk in there and you're not a monster.  You know, you're a normal-looking guy.  It's not like you came in with horns and you're just ripping women's tops off in the jurors' box and shit. 
[03:01:30]  That had to have helped.  That's true.  Well, I wish I could be like that sometimes.  Just go and squeeze the jurors, too.  In my fantasy.  In my fantasy.  You know, is that what you think about it?  I don't know why.  No, I just...  I think whenever you picture an obscenity trial...  Some bad person, yeah.  You would picture, like, some guy sitting there slouched back in his chair,  eyeing the judge and, you know, giving her the tongue and shit like that.  But it really...  I think that probably would have carried some weight, at least with me, but I'm no judge. 
[03:02:00]  The unfortunate thing is that I thought that I was shooting blanks  and I made my wife pregnant, like, six months before this.  So she sat in the front row with, you know, she's pregnant.  And then the prosecution uses a picture.  They couldn't identify my building because our name's not on the front of my building.  So they had this L.A. Vice guy who goes by and took a picture of the building.  And he took a picture of two things.  He took a picture of my wife entering the building.  And he said, well, that's Karen Stoliano, right? 
[03:02:30]  My wife, who was sitting in the front row, six months pregnant.  And the prosecutor says, can you identify her in the courtroom?  And she says, yeah, that's her sitting right there.  So now the jury is seeing this six-month pregnant, beautiful woman, my wife, sitting there.  And they probably were a bit more sympathetic.  Yeah, yeah.  So that might have been a flub by the prosecution.  It's like, yes, you want to put the glove on.  We certainly thought it was a flub by the prosecution, but I don't know what they were thinking.  And the spawn of Satan's in there.  Look at these monsters. 
[03:03:00]  They couldn't prove because we don't have a name.  In fact, the only way they proved that it was Evil Angel is we had a little picture of my wife's cat, Squeaky.  And it said the sign, because Squeaky's going like this in the picture.  And it said, beware of the evil pussy.  And they said, evil, this must be Evil Angel.  And that's the government's case.  This is police work for you, you know.  And when you think of all the other things there are to do and all the other things that the taxpayers' dollars can be spent on,  this is a prime example of just a huge waste of resources. 
[03:03:30]  Well, didn't Larry Flint go through all this, too?  It's like, didn't Larry get prosecuted for obscenity a fucking...  Didn't that set some kind of precedent where the judge should have just thrown it out immediately?  He did a Supreme Court favor Larry King.  It was too silly to be talking about the evil pussycat.  Yes.  This is not...  I deem this silly.  You would think...  No, Larry was prosecuted at a different time when things were a bit more conservative.  Yeah.  It's wonderful how our society is advancing and more tolerant, I think, all the time. 
[03:04:00]  Look at you guys from the air, right?  For now.  Larry was convicted a couple times and was overturned on appeal a couple of times.  And I think he won an acquittal another time.  He went through a lot.  He was facing a lot more jail time.  In fact, he spent a little bit of time in jail.  Although the inside story is I think he told his lawyer, don't bail me out right away.  Right.  He wanted a little...  Press conference from jail.  Yeah, yeah.  Larry's a great guy.  And didn't he show up?  This is the beauty of Larry.  He would sit in court with a shirt and it just had a giant black cock on it. 
[03:04:30]  And it said, I wish I was black.  That was what fucking Larry Flint would wear to court.  He was a belligerent motherfucker.  I wish I was black.  Yeah, Larry had no fear.  No, he really didn't give a fuck.  No, it's fantastic.  And they don't show that in a movie.  They show the I wish I was black, but I guess to show it on TV, they don't show the giant black cock.  It was the greatest shirt ever.  That's fantastic.  So they're honoring you tonight.  What's happening tonight?  Because I'm actually going to a function that is John's...  It's a function honoring free speech or whatever. 
[03:05:00]  And I'm like, I don't know, some kind of guest of honor.  I don't want to say that.  But I'm going there and it's being used to raise money for free speech and stuff like that.  It really is important.  It's like we bitch about it on the other thing.  But when I heard that Max went to jail and you, Yoshi, actually told me that you had gotten charged.  It's fucking enraging.  I honestly didn't know that there were still laws on the books that could put people in jail for obscenity.  I thought that had been done away with. 
[03:05:30]  I really did.  Well, the great thing about our country and our society right now is that most people think the way you do.  Because people are tolerant and they think we live in a free country.  And we don't, in fact, all the time.  But the general sentiment is that way.  And because of that, I think that I would have been acquitted.  The judge, he didn't throw it out technically.  He ruled for acquittal before we even put on our defense because their case fell apart for various reasons.  Because my lawyers picked it apart and said, well, they didn't even prove that he shipped the movie. 
[03:06:00]  They did such a bad job.  So you guys didn't even have to do anything.  Well, we did jury selection.  I had to spend all the money.  But the jury actually didn't vote on it because the judge said there's not enough evidence to convict on any of the charges because they did such a bad job in their case.  And my lawyers were really good.  Well, shouldn't that have happened when they first presented it and save you a little bit of fucking money?  No, because they didn't know that.  I mean, I was also being prosecuted on another law that was designed to prosecute phone sex and stuff where it said that it was too easy for minors to look at my stuff on the Internet because you just have to do some clicks and stuff like that. 
[03:06:30]  And they played this trailer, which did some of the same stuff, squirting and things like that were in the trailer.  And when they played the trailer, it froze up in the middle of the courtroom because they didn't capture it correctly.  They didn't know how to play it back.  And it was like this really interesting day and a half where they're trying to make it play.  And the judge says, well, do you think you can make it play?  And one of my lawyers gets up and says, it's like, well, I captured it in one format. 
[03:07:00]  And then they tried to play it on it with a different software.  And it's like the sprockets don't think, man, whatever.  And they had two and a half years to prepare this case.  It's an incredible waste of our taxpayer money.  But that was one of their –  I have to say –  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  I have to say I'm really disappointed they did such a bad job because this – I thought this was going to be like the high point of my autobiography.  It was going to go in here and the jury, you know, and they'll be all the sweating and the jury would like vote him or they'd be hung or something like that.  And then they just farted out. 
[03:07:30]  It was just –  But one of their points was that it was too easy for children to find things that they defined as obscene on the Internet.  Say that again.  They were saying that it was – that your work was too readily available to children accessing –  Yeah.  The standard of the Internet for a lot of sites, for most sites, is that you click and assert that you're over the age of 18.  Sure.  But I could still go to Google Images and type in any disgusting phrase that I want and I'm going to see it.  There are a huge number of sites that don't require that.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  The fact of the matter is that filters are the best way and monitoring your children is the best way.  Monitoring, parenting, I think.  Not going after parenting.  Parenting is the best thing you can do.  Well, when you brought up the fact that they would play some of this stuff in court, what was your feeling when you're sitting there watching this being played in front of people that obviously would be uncomfortable?  Did you ever get the feeling where you were ready to laugh even though it was a horrible situation?  But, like, did you look at faces and go, like, oh, my God, she sure doesn't like this.  She's not going to like what's coming up. 
[03:08:30]  Like, what was going through your head when they show some of this stuff deemed obscene, you know, that they deemed obscene?  You mean that the girl wasn't going to like the milk coming out?  No, they were lapping it up.  Are you kidding?  Were they really?  Were they really?  Yeah.  Come on.  That's the whole point of the movie.  Exactly.  No, he needs a jury.  Who's not doing the movie to make it look like it's on the court?  I mean, in the courtroom.  The people in the court.  When they were playing for the court.  Oh, was I thinking they were going to hate it?  And while you're sitting there, though, looking around, what was going through your mind?  Were you like, oh, fuck, I'm sunk?  Or were you thinking, holy shit, this is funny?  No, really, really, I had to think about this for two and a half years. 
[03:09:00]  I had to think about this before the trial.  And I had to think about, well, what is it that I sell?  What is it that represents my life?  And I looked at it very carefully and I thought about it from a lot of different ways.  And I really am proud of what I do.  And I'm sitting there and I'm looking at these movies and I'm saying, that's pretty well done.  And I'm really happy I sell this stuff.  And I could see that, excuse me, some of the jurors were uncomfortable.  A little uncomfortable.  They were being forced to look at it by the government.  Big rods.  They're trying to cover up in their pants.  It was a very interesting experience to go through it. 
[03:09:30]  And it was, in the end, because I won, it was life affirming for me.  It was like, okay, I really am proud of my life.  And I'm really happy that I sell these movies.  And I think that people who are willing to have the courage to stand up to conventional thinking and say, I'm going to be outside the norm, those are the people that move the world forward.  And that's what we need.  We need people who think outside the usual parameters in whatever field and are willing to have the courage to do that.  And even if it's milk squirting out of girls' butts, who knows how much pleasure people could get from that. 
[03:10:00]  And I think it does set the stage for other things that other people find horrible that aren't.  You know, it's like you said, gay marriage, things like that.  I mean, people are completely offended to the point where they want to kill people for that.  And then there are other people that are fine with it.  It's just, I can't buy into the fact that there are laws, though, that other people's morality can just be dumped on us. 
[03:10:30]  And if it's not just a dialogue between two people, I don't like this, I do like this, I produce this, I hate this, it has to get the government involved where you have the threat of losing your freedom, going to prison for making something that people enjoy, consume, and watch privately.  Well, you know, you're an American, you see.  I try.  You believe that we live in a free country.  We have this wonderful country that was founded with a bill of rights. 
[03:11:00]  I'm a little more cynical than I'm coming across here, I think.  I mean, but most of the rest of the world do not have the protections of freedom that we have.  You know, Muslim countries, they're not supposed to drink.  They're not supposed to.  I mean, in China, it's a capital crime to sell pornography.  You can be put to death for selling pornography in China.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's insane.  And they're, like, really big, China.  There's a lot of people there that probably...  If they were to take over the world, oh, my God, you know, I wouldn't have a job, I'd probably be in jail for sure. 
[03:11:30]  We'd fight to protect our pornography.  Go to war.  Go to war for that, sir.  Amen.  The most important thing that America exports is the idea of freedom.  That's what America really needs to be proud of.  But then we really don't get the enjoyment of the freedom here, totally.  We've spoken about this a lot on the air.  The freedoms that they talk about that we enjoy are usually held up with things like permits and taxes and liens and waivers. 
[03:12:00]  And there's all kinds of shit you've got to do to enjoy this freedom.  Like we were talking, you can't just go, like, I'm hungry, I'm going to grab my gun, I'm going to go bag a deer, and I'll drag it back to my house.  Now you've got a firing inside county lines, you've got a poaching charge against you.  You know, there's plenty of things that you can't do that you would think, as an American, I'm free to do a lot of things. 
[03:12:30]  But you're really not.  If you want to have a food cart in Los Angeles and put bacon on your hot dogs, you can't do that either because of all sorts of regulations.  It's crazy.  The structure, unfortunately, is set up so that government gets bigger all the time.  There's incentives for government to get bigger all the time, and it's a constant battle.  Again, though, it's based on dumb people accepting the fact that the government is helping you.  They're helping you and protecting you from things.  They're not taking away freedoms.  They're giving you protection. 
[03:13:00]  And then you realize, no, you've just taken away a freedom.  Most of the time they're protecting other people who have more political power than you do so that they can make more money.  Almost always, you know, some special interest has controlled the mechanism of government.  Did the ACLU come to you at all?  Did the ACLU contact you?  No.  Would this be an ACLU issue?  I mean, someone's going to tell me why it's not.  But why wouldn't the American Civil Liberties Union fight for somebody making adult movies with adults for adults? 
[03:13:30]  They probably would have years ago, but now they're more of a, I don't know, socially accepted.  Did they fight for Lenny Bruce?  I don't remember.  I don't know.  I would doubt it.  But they fight for things that are really unpopular sometimes, and I don't know why.  They'll give a reason, well, it was a state issue.  They'll give some reason.  But how about instead of harping on the fact, like where they want people to get fired for using politically incorrect language?  They've just become a business, though, like National Organization for Women, NAACP. 
[03:14:00]  They all start with this righteous purpose, and then after a while it just turns into, hey, look, we're generating some cash here.  And then it turns into this kind of politically correct, socially accepted thing where they can't delve into really controversial subjects or else they'll lose their base and their support.  I'm still confused about the obscenity thing.  I've just been sitting back.  I know.  It's crazy.  Because a video most of us have seen, Two Girls, One Cup.  Yeah. 
[03:14:30]  That video went viral.  No one's selling it, and no one knows where it came from.  Right, where the server is.  Is that what that's about, you think?  There's only in Brazil, actually, that –  And they have different laws, or – but how do they not go after websites in America that show that video?  You know what I mean?  Because that video is over the top, unbelievably obscene to a lot of people.  I loved it, though, but, you know, it's hilarious.  Practically speaking, there's no target.  I think that if it was commercially being sold and a lot of people were buying it or something like that, that they might have, in fact, gone after it if they could have. 
[03:15:00]  But if there was –  But I would think someone made a few bucks off that somewhere.  I don't know.  Because I think it got to a point, actually, we couldn't play it anymore because it was on some pay sites, right?  Pop-up ads and stuff like that, yeah.  Yeah.  The girls probably made a couple of bucks.  A couple of bucks?  They just had to dig out their pay out of the shit.  A free dinner.  You know, I mean, it's hard to defend some things like that, but you have to defend people's right to do that. 
[03:15:30]  Exactly.  And that's always been my whole thing is like – and there's plenty of stuff I don't like, but, you know, you're like, hey, they're free to do it.  I'm not going to interfere.  So what is the average – and I know it's probably different for different companies.  What is the average girl –  48 percent.  That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure.  What does the average girl make for a porn movie or a scene or a guy make for a scene?  People have no way to judge what their lives are like.  You've been hanging around the porn business.  You've done AVN shows. 
[03:16:00]  You've never talked to them.  Why do you ask me this question?  Because I try to fuck them, and they don't.  I never talk business at the vagina.  And they say I do – anal is $1,500.  Thank you, Danny.  Is anal $1,500?  That makes sense.  I mean, I heard you get more for anal.  Yeah, if you're a star, it's $2,500 or $3,000.  I don't know.  She's been doing it for free my whole life.  But with all the free stuff on the internet, though, actually –  Prices went down?  – have gone down.  So, you know, for a big – you know, there are some girls that make a lot of money, and like Jenna Hayes.  I paid her a lot of money.  But because Sasha Gray was brand new when I used her in my last big movie, she didn't make as much money as Jenna Hayes made on that movie. 
[03:16:30]  But now, Sasha Gray would make more money.  It depends on your popularity or whatever.  Do you think most of them try to – like the girls – like you get – look at like Belladonna or, you know, Jenna Jameson.  There's very few women that get to that point where they're kind of like moguls in the business.  There's only a few that seem to get to that place.  Yeah, but maybe more than guys.  I mean, how many male actors have gotten to that point?  I mean, that's just, you know, some people are cut out to be more business people, and some people are. 
[03:17:00]  Belladonna has done a very good job of marketing herself and organizing and producing and doing very good creative stuff.  Jenna Jameson and a few other girls.  But it's a business where women are free to do that, though, and completely treated like equals with men.  It's the marketplace that speaks.  You know, people want to buy your stuff.  They buy their stuff, and women have done very well.  You know, I did a radio thing where I debated this woman, Gail Dines, who thinks that gonzo porn is violence towards women. 
[03:17:30]  What is gonzo porn, for people to talk about?  Well, the really interesting thing is she made a differentiation, because she didn't want to say all porn was bad, because that would be very unpopular.  But you could say that certain feature porn, where the director controls the sex and the image of the kind of sex that's being shown, where, okay, well, you want to fuck the girl in this way, in a politically correct way or whatever, that's okay.  Whereas gonzo porn is more like just be creative and do whatever you want and be spontaneous, which is what I am credited with innovating, mostly because I was in the movie as the cameraman or whatever the fuck. 
[03:18:00]  I mean, gonzo porn.  Gonzo porn really is about people being more creative with sex and being just free to fuck in whatever way they want.  And certain men and certain women want to fuck in a more rough way or something that looks like what they call violence, which isn't real violence.  It's just rougher sex.  You know, basically, it's people who aren't very good in bed being jealous of people who are good in bed.  That's really what it's all about. 
[03:18:30]  I hate to say it, but that's what it's all about.  You know, and I would like that, because I know both sides of that equation.  I was certainly not very good in bed when I was younger.  And now I've been trained by my wife to be better in bed to a large extent.  Goddamn great, man.  Well, I'm happy you got acquitted, man, or got dropped.  That was really great news for you, but, you know, I think for the entire business.  Yeah, yeah.  And for anybody who's kind of creative in a slightly controversial way.  Edgy way, yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Got to keep all the doors open.  You know, I don't want the government stepping in and telling me what I can or can't see, no matter what it is.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  Yeah, that's a very bad precedent.  What's the website?  Evilangel.com?  Evilangel.com, yeah.  And the best movies.  I don't watch Joey's tranny movies, although they get sent to me so occasionally.  They'll wind up in my VCR.  I haven't watched every rogue adventure.  VCR!  You know, whatever.  Yeah, VCR.  I tell you, no, I'm lying.  What an asshole I am.  You know, I don't have my 8mm thing going. 
[03:19:30]  And I will see you tonight.  I'm happy you came in tonight.  Very cool.  All right, thanks, guys.  Congratulations.  Thanks so much, man.  John Stagliano.  Right?  No, the G is silent.  It is, right?  You left me hanging.  It is.  Stagliano.  Do you want to get the plug in?  You don't say Belagna.  It wasn't Joe DiMaggio.  We had an argument with him yesterday.  He said that the G in Sting was silent.  And then we asked him, how do you say it?  And he goes, Sting.  Sting.  So we didn't know what the plug he was talking about. 
[03:20:00]  All right, you know what?  We'll just do this.  We got the American Pickers thing from yesterday.  That's hilarious.  So we're going to end the show with this.  Am I plugged?  No, yes.  Pluggy.  How about I'll tell you what I won't plug.  No.  Irrelevant.  What aren't you going to plug?  Fuck January 15th, Late Show Atlantic City.  Me, Brewer, Atel.  Bill Burr on sale tomorrow morning.  Big deal.  Don't even think about it.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug. 
[03:20:30]  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug.  I'll tell you what I'm going to plug. </pre>
