<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the introduction of 12-year-old “Skid Marks,” a listener whose musical parodies, including songs about the Titanic, Charles Grodin's toupee, and a track titled "I Like to Fart," were played on air.  Skid Marks was scheduled to appear as a guest the following day.  This was followed by the airing of the "Road Rage" segment, a collection of recordings filled with extensive cursing and vulgar commentary about other drivers and pedestrians captured during the hosts' commute.

Listener feedback then took center stage, focusing on the show's placement on listeners' car radio presets.  Several emails and faxes were read, detailing the hosts' weekend activities (Opie's pumpkin picking and fall foliage viewing, Anthony's winery visits), and a listener's attempt at promoting the show with a Montauk banner.  The hosts then discussed the planned (but ultimately not conducted live) interview with Reverend Al Sharpton, who was in Haiti assessing hurricane damage.  A satirical, fictionalized phone call with Sharpton was performed, during which he humorously blamed the hurricane on white people.

A heated exchange followed with a disgruntled listener who accused the hosts of racism based on previous on-air comments about Sammy Sosa and Washington Heights. The listener's anger escalated, culminating in a threat to have her husband call and complain.

Suddenly,  Diceman, whose birthday it was, made an unscheduled visit to the studio, causing a brief, chaotic interruption before being sent away.  The show concluded with a discussion of upcoming TV shows, including *Mad About You* and *Real World*, and the announcement of upcoming Aerosmith ticket giveaways.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Skid Marks, he was on our show last week.  Yes.  He called in with a little song. He's 12 years old.  Mm-hmm.  Called in with a Bill and Monica song.  Well, now he's sent his little tape.  He does song parodies. He's 11 years old.  He put us to shame.  He has more creativity than you and I put together, I do believe.  That doesn't take much.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm quite honest.  But he FedExed a package, and he's got three songs for us to play today.  He's got a Titanic one.  Yep.  And he's got a Charles Grodin one? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, Charles Grodin toupee song from Skid Marks, and a song he likes to call I Like to Fart.  All right.  It'll be nice to hear an 11-year-old doing fart humor instead of us.  And he's coming on the show? Is this what I hear?  Yeah, I think he's going to stop by tomorrow.  I feel special. I feel like a celebrity's going to be on our show for once.  We'll have him in the imaginary ballroom.  Yeah, Skid Mark jamming tomorrow on the Open Anthony Show.  If you're a faithful listener of the program, you know who he is.  Also, I'm very excited to bring back Road Rage today. 
[00:01:00]  Yes!  It's one of our most popular bits with the faithful listeners.  We haven't done one in about a month and a half.  We had the tape going for the lovely commute in today.  And we're going to get that on later.  Yeah, actually, I'm going to try to get it on before the end of the hour.  Are you?  Yeah.  Good.  Because there were some classics today.  The guy delivering the pork is priceless.  My favorite was the guy illegally parked in the limo.  Yeah.  Yeah, we might have to set that up because I don't know if we got the audio. 
[00:01:30]  I think we might have.  All right.  We'll see.  On the way, we got the Road Rage bit.  And if you got something for the show, you know the deal.  It's like the People's Radio Show.  We encourage you guys to participate in our lovely program.  And there's many ways you could do it.  The first way is through the instant feedback.  Well, WNEW.com.  Click on our pictures and you could email us here in the studio.  And we like to read about your opinions of the show, whether we suck or we rock.  But also use it in a very intelligent, creative way.  Like, if you got a comment about anything we've talked about in the last few weeks, you know, write your thoughts down. 
[00:02:00]  Throw it into the studio.  And Anthony reads most of them on the air, actually.  It's a way to get in.  You know, it's the back door.  Yeah, the back door to the show.  Fax Line, 212-957-WNEW.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  Two for Tuesday with the Goo Goo Dolls.  That's name and slide before that off their latest CD.  Dizzy Up the Girl.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  And the faxes are spilling in like crazy.  This one says, I love your show.  Would you please play Alice in Chains?  I have never heard them on WNEW. 
[00:02:30]  We play Alice in Chains.  Not enough, if you ask me.  I love Alice in Chains.  And this person says, if you do, you will jump from preset number five to preset number one on my car radio.  We've got to play it then today.  Well, there, wait, one, two, three, four.  No, that's okay.  Preset five is acceptable to us.  Because that's, you know, the first set of presets.  We'll take five.  We just don't want to be preset eight.  I've been reading a lot of email from people.  We're moving all over the presets.  Are we? 
[00:03:00]  But a lot of them, yeah, we're falling into the between three and five.  Just that whole area.  Three, four, five.  We just want to be one of the first six.  It takes something really big to boost you to that first spot.  Right.  That's your favorite stage.  And that's the one you don't even have to take your eyes off the road when you hit that button.  Yes.  Boink.  There's my station.  There you go.  We want to be that.  And Bonnie writes, hi, Open Ant.  My friend Sandy is going out to Montauk right now to go fishing for the day.  And guess what she has?  She has a big banner with Open Anthony, a logo, and it says you've got to listen or you don't know what you're missing. 
[00:03:30]  102.7 N.E.W.  Say hello to her from her friend Bonnie.  See?  Well, that's good.  She's part of phase two, though.  But out at Montauk?  Yeah, but I'm sure she's driving from the city to Montauk.  Oh, okay.  She'll advertise the show all through the L.I.E.  I thought she just had the banner out at Montauk.  Yeah, that wouldn't be a good thing.  But we are looking for people to, you know, to promote our show for us.  Phase two, yes. 
[00:04:00]  Phase two is telling others about Open Anthony.  So we appreciate that, Bonnie and friend.  And then this guy writes, it's from Tom, he's offering me a free week, a weekend of fishing,  so I don't have to go to any more Apple festivals and pumpkin picking and stuff.  Tom, you rule.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  Oh, we had to go pumpkin picking this weekend.  I think everyone knows I had to go pumpkin picking because the email went nuts.  That's right, because I'm sure, I am sure, as God is my witness, next weekend, 
[00:04:30]  me and Open are going to go out and we're going to the clubs or something.  We're going to go watch some football at the bar or something, right?  Real manly weekend next weekend, right?  So anyway, on the way, we got some Tom Petty.  Where are you going next weekend, though?  You mean you can't hang out?  Gee, I wonder what you're doing.  Tell everybody what you're doing next weekend, after this weekend of pumpkin picking.  I'm going north.  Yeah, you're going up north.  Yeah.  Must be something really cool to do. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Where are you going?  Our old stomping ground up there in Massachusetts?  I'm going to check out the leaves.  What?  What?  I'm going to check out the leaves.  Check out what?  Leaves.  Leaves?  Leaves?  Yeah.  Did you hear that, people?  Opie now goes from pumpkin picking out on Long Island to this weekend.  He's going to go up north to watch the leaves change.  I'll give you a hint, though.  Well, it's prime.  It's prime up there.  Is it the prime peak color?  Peak color is happening. 
[00:05:30]  So you're going to drive a couple of hundred miles to go see the leaves.  Yep.  You want a little hint?  You want a little clue?  Let me clue you in on something.  If you wait a couple of weeks, it looks the same here.  See, it's a little south of where you're going to be going.  Yeah.  So down here, they turn a couple of weeks later.  So you mean if I wait a couple more weeks, I could just look out my window?  You look at leaves.  You have to drive around and look at leaves.  That's just something you do when you're on your way somewhere cool during the fall. 
[00:06:00]  And you're like, hey, look at the leaves.  That's kind of cool.  Park the car.  Let's go ahead and catch the game.  Yeah, I'm going out of my way to see leaves.  Yes.  It's going to be great.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's a lot of fun.  Where's my bullwhip?  Where's my bullwhip?  I've got to do it again.  Come on.  All right.  Here's Opie.  I've got my bullwhip that I got yesterday.  I could crack this pretty good.  I'm like Indiana Jones.  All right.  Here's Opie.  Figure it out.  Meow.  Meow. 
[00:06:30]  Meow.  Meow.  You get it?  Yeah.  I think everyone got it.  I think so.  Anthony.  What?  You're no different.  What are you doing this weekend?  I'm different.  What?  You got cornered in bed this morning.  Yeah.  Jen heard the show yesterday.  Yeah.  Talking about how guys and girls plan things differently.  Guys don't really plan things.  Well, that guy late in the show yesterday made a great point.  He said that guys don't start thinking about the weekend until Thursday, Thursday afternoon.  Yeah.  And most women start thinking about weekend plans on Monday. 
[00:07:00]  And that's the problem that guys are facing.  See, we've got to get more organized and start thinking about our weekend on Monday.  And then we'll have a say in what is going to happen every weekend.  Instead of just being led into something.  Right.  So what did your wife say?  The second I woke up, because she heard the show yesterday.  Yeah.  She goes, got any plans for this weekend?  Oh, jeez.  And then I'm trying to think, God, I've got to have some kind of plan.  Because you know she's got a plan.  Because she's got plans.  Yeah.  So if I don't have plans, all of a sudden, I have plans. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  They're not my plans, but they're plans.  So obviously, you didn't have any plans for the weekend.  So what are you doing this coming weekend?  Well, friends are coming down from Massachusetts.  And?  We're going to hang out with them.  And?  And what?  I know it's something stupid.  And?  I think we're going to check out some of those wineries out here.  Shut up. 
[00:08:00]  Give me the whip.  Give me the whip.  Oh, come on.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday.  With Tom Petty.  Listen to her heart.  And Free Fallin'.  Free Fallin' was the song you had to be listening for this hour.  To win the Kenny Wayne Shepard tickets.  And Joe Carrington of Chester, New York.  He was paying attention.  And now he's got a pair of tickets to see the taping of the VH1 Hard Rock Live.  Presented by American Express and The Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  Tom in Westfield. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah?  He doesn't like Free Fallin'.  By Tom Petty.  All right.  And for that reason, he just moved us to preset seven.  Ah!  We lost.  We lost ground.  Man, we walk such a fine line, don't we?  We can't win.  Come on, Tom.  Give us a break.  Come on, man.  At least give us number six so we're not on the preset Bs.  Yeah.  We're on his second set of presets that you don't even know how to get to.  For one lousy song?  Come on, Tom.  Bump us back up to at least six. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, maybe someone out there really likes Free Fallin' and they'll bump us from preset eight to preset five.  Oh, I don't know how to deal with that.  We've got to make up the losses here.  We can't lose any more listeners.  We really need to start gaining listeners at this point.  Oh, well.  Doesn't anyone understand that?  Ah, all right.  Later on, I think we're going to be talking with Reverend Al Sharpton.  Yeah, what is he up to?  He's going to Haiti.  Why is he going to Haiti?  Uh, to check out the damage done by Hurricane... 
[00:09:30]  Hurricane George.  Oh, this just in.  Hurricane George has been downgraded to a fall breeze.  A stiff breeze.  Stiff breeze, so some leaves might fall off your trees in front of your house.  Reverend Al's pissed, though.  From what I hear, he's blaming the hurricane on the white man.  And we're going to be talking to him a little later.  I can't wait to hear that.  I can't either.  I'm sure it'll all make sense coming from Reverend Al.  Also, the staff of the Opie and Anthony show, hard at work editing our Road Rage tape. 
[00:10:00]  The staff.  That's me and you.  Hope he's doing it.  Yeah.  The songs are on.  I'm doing it while the songs are on.  So, as soon as we get that edited, we'll put it on the air.  People enjoy when we have Road Rage on the way into work.  And had a couple of good, stupid MFs on the road today.  The best was the pork guys.  We saw a few of them on our way in today.  Riding bicycle.  Riding the bicycle.  I'll ride my swing bicycle.  Deliver mong chong pork.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York. 
[00:10:30]  Two for Tuesday with Bruce Springsteen, Candy's Room, and Pink Cadillac.  The box set, I do believe, is coming out November 17th, if I'm not mistaken.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A little later this hour, you've got to be listening for Foxy Lady from Jimi Hendrix.  When you hear that, if you're the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, you've got a pair of tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard.  Opie, we are not alone in our suffering at times when we have to do these things on the weekends with the girlfriend, wife. 
[00:11:00]  You know how guys are.  We never make plans, so we're always included.  In plans.  In the woman's plans.  Brandon, out on Long Island.  Hey guys, there's a good chance I'll run into either one of you two this weekend.  My wife is undecided about which ride is shorter.  Either out to Long Island, to the winery, or up north so Opie can watch the leaves change.  Is he going to watch the leaves change this weekend?  He doesn't know.  At this point, his wife is undecided. 
[00:11:30]  She hasn't decided yet.  Yeah, of course.  She's got to decide.  Okay.  And we've got another fax here.  Sarah, I guess Paul, heard your show, topic about plans.  I've been married seven years, and it just doesn't matter what day I submit my plans for approval, they are vetoed.  Tell Anthony that the winery tour is among the worst of the weekends.  I had to endure five hours with her parents sipping wine.  Just shoot me next time and spare me the agony.  Tell him just to start convulsing after the second glass, and maybe he can spend the day in the emergency room. 
[00:12:00]  It has to be more enjoyable.  I love the sarcasm, guys.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Jeff writes in an email, okay, I have you guys on preset one, but if I hear another Goo Goo Dolls song, you go on to preset eight.  They're holding us hostage.  They are holding us hostage.  With the presets.  We've got one girl who's going to make us preset one if we play Alice in Chains.  The other guy's going to take us off his presets altogether if we play Free Fallin' again.  Right.  Here's a guy who's going to take us off if we play the Goo Goo Dolls again. 
[00:12:30]  There's another guy that says, F the guy that doesn't like Petty.  Don't stop playing Petty on that idiot's request.  I suffered through the hooch.  He doesn't like that song.  I'll be back on Friday to send a big F you to the guy that said not to play Petty.  This is great.  Right on.  All right.  The facts lie if you want in on the conversation today.  212-957-WNEW.  Still got to get to the Yankees and all sorts of other things happening around town. 
[00:13:00]  If you've got any thoughts, give us a call or give us an instant feedback there.  Go to the WNEW website and click on our pictures and that instant feedback will go right to us here in the studio.  The Rock of New York.  1027-WNEW.  Two for Tuesday with Aerosmith.  Train kept a roll in all night long and crazy from the Get a Grip CD.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good news, Anthony.  What?  Our road rage is just about edited and ready for airplay.  We're going to do that in the 5 o'clock hour and say it's a bit that a lot of the faithful listeners really, really enjoy. 
[00:13:30]  Well, it's because they can relate to it.  Yeah, they can relate to that.  Driving in.  And the best part about it is the comments we make.  In between cursing out drivers, we talk about all the people we see on the sidewalks.  It's brutal, actually.  I usually don't remember it.  I black out when I drive in.  I just can't take the pressure.  It's a taste of reality, though.  Also on the way, we've got Al Sharpton making a visit today.  Yeah, he's going to Haiti.  Okay.  See how much damage was done by the hurricane.  Now, when is Al supposed to make his appearance? 
[00:14:00]  Like they haven't had this huge thing that's full of wind hit him already.  Reverend Al's going to visit, too.  I don't know.  I think as soon as...  As soon as you write it?  As soon as I write this.  Reverend Al will be on.  I don't have a time schedule.  Well, it takes a while to think of things that rhyme with cash.  Yeah, if anyone can help us out, we need a rhyme for cash at this point.  This is how we do our show.  People think we're polished and have it all figured out before we come out on the air. 
[00:14:30]  No.  If you've got a rhyme for cash, yeah, fax it in.  That's 2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W.  Got to get the listeners involved.  Great.  Now you're going to get 6,000 faxes.  Lash, ash, mash.  All right.  Thank you.  Any type of rhyme with money usually helps out the bit.  Also, I got the Skidmark songs.  You want to hear a little ditty real fast here?  Our little pal, Skidmark.  We kind of like this guy because he's immature like us.  We're in our 30s, though, and he's 11. 
[00:15:00]  I think he's 12, isn't he?  He's 12.  Oh, okay.  He's moving up there.  But when you're that age, it's a big difference, though.  It's not like going, hey, I'm 34.  Oh, 35.  Yeah.  11 and 12 to a boy is like a big deal.  Well, 12 and 13 is the big difference, though.  That's true.  I just mean one year makes a lot to a kid.  Well, he called us Friday with this great song about Bill and Monica, and we laughed pretty  hard.  And then he FedExed a package to us.  He's pretty sharp.  With other song parodies, he did.  I could just see his mom playing the piano at home while little 12-year-old Skidmark, 
[00:15:30]  you know, sings a ditty.  Skidmark.  Would you like to hear his song, I Like to Fart?  Skidmark, or the Charles Grodin toupee song?  I want to hear the Charles Grodin toupee song.  All right.  We can play that.  This is our new pal Skidmark, or Skidmarks.  Skidmarks.  He's coming in, what, tomorrow, actually, to perform live.  In the imaginary ballroom.  On our show.  He's going to jam.  Well, we're just like Rosie O'Donnell having kids on the show.  Well, it helps her rating, so. 
[00:16:00]  Only it's a little bit more twisted, isn't it?  Yeah, a little bit.  All right.  So this is 12-year-old Skidmarks and his lovely little tune about Charles Grodin's hairpiece.  Charles Grodin wears a funny little ratsy-ass toupee on his bald head.  And I can't determine if the damn thing is either living or dead.  Maybe he should take it for a check up at the local SPCA. 
[00:16:30]  For I think that little Wiglet needs assistance in the worst way.  Come on.  He's 12 and he's making up songs about Charles Grodin's toupee.  That's good.  He's got a career.  What were you doing at 12?  Um, nothing.  Exactly.  I was delivering penny savers on Long Island at 12.  You at least were motivated.  I was doing nothing. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, Daddy just give you an allowance?  No, uh, sorry.  Uh, Daddy, uh, left when I was, uh, 11, I think.  So, no, Daddy wasn't around, Opie.  So how'd you get your money for your baseball cards and...  I don't know.  I think I stole it.  I don't even know.  I blocked all that out of my head.  The scary part is if I pressured you, I think you probably did steal it.  Yeah, I probably did.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Would you like to hear his other song real fast?  Which one is this?  Uh, the I Like to Fart song.  Oh, 12-year-old kids like to fart. 
[00:17:30]  That's probably what I was doing when I was 12.  Yeah, that's it.  I was farting all the time.  All right.  Let's, let's, uh, do this.  Do we have the intro on here, too?  Little Skid Marks intro?  All right.  Check this out.  I got a song for you.  Anyone out there want to pull my finger?  I like to fart.  I'm a master of this art.  I pass a lot of air through my derriere. 
[00:18:00]  No one can surpass my skill of passing gas.  My technique of ripping parts is highly state of art.  How old are we? 
[00:18:30]  Well, he's 12, so I guess we're on the same level.  Oh, man.  1027 WNW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with Jimi Hendrix, Hey Joe, and Foxy Lady.  Foxy Lady was the song you had to be listening for this hour to score the tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard and John Boda of Staten Island was paying attention.  And he's got a pair of tickets to the taping of VH1's Hard Rock Live presented by American Express and The Rock of New York.  1027 WNW, the next song you've got to be listening for is Brass in Pocket by The Pretenders. 
[00:19:00]  Sometime in the 5 o'clock hour we'll do that, and all you have to do is be the 10th caller to score the Kenny Wayne Shepard tickets.  Doing this all day long for you, by the way.  Very busy day.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A lot of people liked Skidmark songs that we just played a little while ago.  Very cute.  Talent little kid, right?  Isn't he?  Yes.  On the way, we've got Al Sharpton making a visit.  1027 WNW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, David Bowie, the man who sold the world. 
[00:19:30]  Someone called up and said, I thought Nirvana did that song.  No, it's David Bowie's song.  Nirvana did a little cover of that.  Also, golden years before that, Soapy and Anthony, 2 for Tuesday.  Al Sharpton will be calling in in about a half hour.  He's going to Haiti.  Going to Haiti, and he's going to discuss his little trip with us today?  Like they haven't had enough big wind down there.  Now they've got to deal with Al.  Reverend Al is going to go down.  Right on.  He's on a fact-finding mission.  Really?  That's what the paper says. 
[00:20:00]  What's he going to find out?  That a lot of people died, I guess.  Which is obviously very tragic.  Yeah, but I don't know what he's going down there for.  You sure he's not going down there for his own purposes?  Not Reverend Al.  He wouldn't go down there to try to raise money for his own causes, would he?  Opie, now stop it.  I, you know, personally, I don't know how Reverend Al gets his money for those nice suits that he wears these days.  And the big medallions and stuff.  Medallions and airfare to go to Haiti.  And the hair products.  The hair products alone have to amount to thousands of dollars a month. 
[00:20:30]  Does anyone know what Al does for a living when he's not marching?  He's always marching or flying off now to Haiti.  No, I'm serious.  I'm curious.  Does anyone really know what he does?  He must have a job when he's not doing that no justice, no peace thing.  That's his job.  I don't know.  He's going down with other members of the clergy.  Okay.  All right.  We'll get in Al's head in a little bit.  We got that Reverend thing.  Yeah.  Matchbook cover.  Well, they finally handed over the road rage bit.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  So we had to get all the curses out of it and make it radio friendly.  God, I wish they would get into like, maybe at the turn of the century, we'll be able  to curse on the air.  That's kind of stupid that we can't.  Everyone knows.  Okay, watch.  Here's a little test.  Yeah.  The F word.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Say it in your head.  Ready?  Go.  All right.  Very good.  Everyone knows what I meant.  And everyone heard that word at least once today.  Yeah.  So.  Can't say it though.  What if like I say the first part and you say the second part?  Oh, I don't know.  Are we breaking rules? 
[00:21:30]  I don't know.  Maybe there's a gap that's got to go in the middle.  Like if I say, fuck, fuck.  I don't know.  Can we get a shot?  It.  Well, there you go.  I don't know.  I don't even know what the ruling is on that.  As long as there's a gap.  I mean.  I don't know.  I just said the fuck.  And you said the cuh.  Is that the way around the rule?  I don't know.  Who knows?  I don't even know what the rule is on.  Are we going to be fine for even experimenting with that? 
[00:22:00]  Who knows?  Probably.  All right.  So from time to time, we like to tape ourselves on the way into the city.  And if you've never heard this before, what you're going to hear, you got to like set  the scene.  Yes.  It's me and Anthony having lots of road rage, mostly Anthony because he drove today.  I drive.  It's like a scene out of the road warrior when I'm driving.  Yeah.  I have a mission.  I have to get from point A to point B. There are people in my way, and I'm taking it personally.  There you go.  And in between cursing out other drivers, we make fun of every single person we see on  the sidewalk.  You got to comment. 
[00:22:30]  And we don't do these bits often because it's kind of scary to roll down your window  and start screaming at complete strangers in the middle of Manhattan.  And we do it when we don't have tape rolling.  True.  But all right.  Well, here's our ride in today.  Check it out.  What is she smiling about?  Get out of the f***ing lane.  Oh, yeah.  Now she's done the f***ing brakes.  God damn it.  How's the ride?  Good.  Look at this f***ing idiot.  She's got a left plane, girl.  This is the left turns on the bridge, you asshole. 
[00:23:00]  There he is.  There he is.  There he is.  There he is.  There he is.  I got my bicycle.  I don't get to the winch and pull.  God damn, that's funny.  Look at this guy.  Look at the sides of this one.  F*** it.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  No, really.  The big orange afro is making a comeback.  Look at that hair.  The exact shade of Ronald McDonald's hair. 
[00:23:30]  Don't walk, Mace.  Don't walk.  That's telling him.  F***ing assholes.  Move.  What do you think they hide under those turbans?  Seriously.  Oh, look at this old lady, Ant.  Ain't gravity a bitch.  Holy s***.  Why is she lippin'?  Tough night.  Look at all the dirty little girls going into Victoria's Secret.  You're a filthy girl, aren't you?  You buy daddy a teddy.  Don't let him in. 
[00:24:00]  Don't let him in.  He ain't getting anywhere.  Denied.  F***ing assholes.  Get out of here.  Come on.  F***ing assholes.  F***ing assholes.  Tell another one.  Tell another one.  Hey, pork.  Why are you delivering pork?  Is that Wing Chang's or Cao Fang's pork?  With all these skirts, it's starting to look like downtown Hanoi.  Look at the size of this guy's bike chain.  It's as big as the Titanic anchor.  Why even bother at that point?  Because if he lose bike, he can't tell him I'm pork.  Yeah, but the chain costs more than the bike at this point. 
[00:24:30]  That man hates you.  F*** him.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Oh, come on.  With these f***ing people.  Yeah, just stop right there.  Look at this guy.  F*** you.  Oh, he's trying to make you your bitch.  F*** him.  That brownie lady knocking on a guy's hood, trying to get him to move his car.  Or she's going to get the ticket.  He's pissed.  She's knocking on his hood.  He's not happy.  She made you her bitch.  The only time I listen to a black car. 
[00:25:00]  For you kids at home, he says it's the only time you will listen to a black person.  Holy s***.  Can you feel the love?  And that's harsh.  Move, f***ing cabbie.  Move.  Where are you going?  Where the f*** are you going?  Oh, that's a killer move.  I bet you he don't like girls.  He's got to get a World War II Nazi helmet on.  I see that.  He's got a Nazi helmet on.  He says, oh, God.  And we made it. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, what you eating?  Opie and Anthony.  One oh two seven.  Oh, Reverend Al is on hold.  We'll talk to Mr. Sharpton next.  At least it sounds like Mr. Sharpton.  One oh two seven.  W on EW.  The Rock in New York.  Super Tuesday with Nirvana.  That song is about a girl.  From the Unplugged CD.  And come as you are, of course, before that.  A couple from the Unplugged CD.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Got to say hi to everyone on their way to the stadium for the big game tonight. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, Yankees.  It's going to be a horrible ride to the stadium, though.  Yeah.  Rush hour.  You've got a long wait.  But we'll try to keep you entertained.  Yes.  Keep it on N.E.W.  And if you like what you hear today, make us one of your presets.  That's what we're going for, right?  Yes.  We are going for that.  Top preset.  Yes.  Well, Opie, as we said before, Reverend Al is heading to Haiti.  He's part of a contingent of clergy that's going down there.  And he's going to, he's on some kind of fact-finding mission. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know what he's looking for.  What kind of facts.  Well, he's going to see how much damage there was.  Yeah.  And see what he could do to help out the poor people down there.  Well, I think, well, I'm seeing a lot of money in the paper.  You know, United States is shipping like a half a million dollars worth of supplies to the Dominican Republic.  Puerto Rico alone damage is expected to top $2 billion.  Wait a minute.  $2 billion in Puerto Rico?  Doesn't something have to be worth a certain amount before it can be damaged that much? 
[00:27:00]  Fine.  Well, anytime I see.  How much does a tin shack cost?  I saw the news footage.  All the, like, big buildings and stuff on the beachfront, that was fine.  Nothing happened to those.  No.  The big, expensive hotels are just fine.  Yeah.  It seemed to be like the shantytowns that blew down.  Yes.  They don't take the words of the Three Little Pigs book.  Straw blew away when the big, bad wolf did it.  Yeah.  Hay, same thing. 
[00:27:30]  Bricks stands up to the wind.  Okay.  Reverend Al going to Haiti.  Yeah, I guess he's, uh, oh, yeah, what's he looking for?  What's he doing down there?  He just wants to lend his support, obviously.  Well, let's talk.  Maybe he's going to get a hammer and start, you know, rebuilding the shantytowns.  I don't think so.  Take that big-ass medallion of his and hammer some nails in.  Use it like a hammer.  Yeah.  Cling, cling, cling.  All right, Al's on the phone.  Let's get to him here.  No justice, no peace. 
[00:28:00]  No justice, no peace.  All right, Al, calm down.  Open the gate, I'm coming to Haiti.  I am on a fact-finding mission.  I believe the white man has a weather machine and is using it against people of color.  Come on, you're out of your mind.  Haven't you seen Simon Boss Sinister on the Underdog cartoon?  Yes.  He had a weather machine and he is a white man.  Why do you think they call that country Haiti? 
[00:28:30]  I don't know, Al, why?  Because Whitey Hates, the black man.  Have you ever seen a hurricane from a satellite photo?  Yeah, I have.  Now, what color is it?  It's usually white.  It is white.  Why are there no black hurricanes?  Because they are a product of the white man.  Wait a minute, Reverend Al.  Most hurricanes originate in Africa.  Well, uh, well, uh.  Yes, and they are brought here from Africa against their will to do the white man's dirty work. 
[00:29:00]  Now, that sounds familiar, doesn't it?  Now, I need donations for all the devastations.  People are suffering.  Send your cash to Reverend Al.  My wallet will be engorged with your cash for the victims of George.  My hair can withstand hurricane-force winds, but these houses in Haiti could not.  But the rules caved in, so let the cash flow begin. 
[00:29:30]  Send your checks to Reverend Al at the Apollo Theater and make them out to my organization,  Care About Suffering Haitians.  Now, for short, you could just put C-A-S-H.  Now, I can't be lady.  I gots to go to Haiti.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Two from the Pretenders on Two for Tuesday.  That's Cuban Slide and Brass in Pocket.  And before that, Brass in Pocket was the song you had to be listening for this hour  for the tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard.  And Ed Lippert of New Jersey was paying attention, 
[00:30:00]  and he's got a pair of tickets to see Kenny Wayne  in the taping of VH1's Hard Rock Live, presented by American Express.  And The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  There you go.  People like the Al Sharpton thing.  Thank you.  That was a lot of fun.  Wow.  All right.  Someone's saying we're racists, Opie.  We're racists?  Yeah.  Why are we racist?  Because, hey, you're too racist.  That drunken woman's going to beat her kids all over again.  Wait a minute.  Oh, what the hell?  Stall.  Remember her?  Yeah, stall. 
[00:30:30]  I cannot believe you.  You definitely ain't trying to make friends and get listeners in the black community.  Huh.  I'll get the drunk lady.  Hold on.  I screwed up.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah, this lady.  She was calling us a racist last week.  Because we were talking about Sammy Sosa and how everyone in Washington Heights was soaping  up their window with Sosa 66.  So this lady thought we were racist.  Check this out.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, now racism is something that you put on the air, too. 
[00:31:00]  Is there no stopping you guys?  Is there no damn stopping you guys?  You're still conscious?  Just friggin'.  I thought you'd be passed out by now.  The Dominican guy calls up this big guy, and you're making fun of him?  He can write whatever the hell he wants on his car with his soap, okay?  He can write down that 1027 is the bad station if he wants to.  Hello?  You're a rip, lady.  Hold on a second. 
[00:31:30]  Hello?  Yeah, what?  Listen, I don't want any more racism.  I already beeped my husband, and he's going to call you guys, he said, and he's really  mad, okay?  All right.  And me listening to you is going to make his dinner cold, and he comes home with a dinner  call.  I don't know what else is going to happen.  It's going to be on your head.  You're racist.  You're racist.  Say you're a racist.  Accept it. 
[00:32:00]  Say you're a drunk.  Accept it.  So much fun I want.  Who's your husband, Jack Daniels?  I like gin, okay?  Bomb-based, sapphire gin.  All right, we got to go.  We got to go.  1027 WNNW, The Rock of New York with the cars on two for Tuesday.  Later this hour, you've got to be listening for Selling the Drama from live to pick up  those tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard.  Tenth caller will get them when you hear that song.  The phone number here is 212-757-1027. 
[00:32:30]  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  You catching any new TV shows?  I caught ER last week.  Did you?  Yeah.  Was it good?  It was kind of disappointing.  Really?  Yeah.  See, the new season's coming out and I haven't watched one new show.  Well, I don't watch sitcoms anymore, except for, well, I do watch Frasier.  Frasier's good.  It's funny.  Although, I didn't like the premiere episode.  No.  I don't know.  I think they're all losing it.  As I look through the paper, I see the desperate UPN network, who actually had the Diceman at 
[00:33:00]  one point, lost that catch.  You know whose birthday it is today?  Oh.  The Diceman.  Maybe we can get him in a little bit.  Well, he is sitting out there.  Wait.  Yeah, he's out there.  I think he's just kind of waiting around, hoping someone's going to give him a birthday  present today.  How old is he?  They say he's 40?  He can't be.  He's much older than 40.  He was 40 about five years ago.  Maybe Dice, yeah, we'll get Dice in a little while. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Oh, now he's looking at us.  No, Dice.  No, no, no, no.  Sit down.  Sit down.  We'll call for you.  Come on.  Let me in, guys.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's my birthday.  You're not going to leave me.  Hold the door.  Hold the door.  Don't let him in.  Don't let him in.  God, man.  Man, he's desperate for air time.  Always.  And he's always just hanging out in the N.E.W. hallways.  We'll get him in later.  All right.  Good birthday.  Anyway, UPN, new show, yes.  UPN going with, I think, shock value.  The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. 
[00:34:00]  A lot of flack happening about this show.  UPN Desperately Seeking Viewers is trying a mix of The Civil War and Benson.  Horrible concept and no better series.  This guy, Desmond Pfeiffer, is the butler for Abe Lincoln.  And he's a black guy.  And they have a whole series that revolves around this.  It's a wacky comedy about slavery and the Civil War.  That's zanerific.  Outrageous.  Not the worst show in TV history, though. 
[00:34:30]  For being un-PC.  Yeah.  Hogan's Heroes, without a doubt.  Ah, you got a point.  Wins that hands down.  Yeah, those fun-loving, wacky Nazis.  Wasn't that great?  As kids, you know, I'd watch Hogan's Heroes, and it's a comedy with swastikas in it.  Yeah.  Like, they all had the armbands and everything.  Yeah.  Hogan!  A comedy that revolves around a concentration camp.  Oh.  You are a fool!  I just love that show.  But we didn't know any better back then.  No.  Mad About You, debuting tonight. 
[00:35:00]  That is the funniest show ever.  I can't stop laughing at Mad About You.  It is so funny.  You know what?  Let me see what's happening tonight on the premiere debut episode of Mad About You, because  I'm sure the concept alone has got to crack me up.  Let's see.  Paul Reiser.  Yeah.  Oh, he's got a life-threatening problem, and he's in the hospital.  And Helen Hunt is there weeping over his body as they wheel him into surgery.  Have you seen it? 
[00:35:30]  God, that show's hysterical.  Yeah, there's nothing better than terminal illness.  Is it a very special episode of Mad About You?  Every episode is a very special episode.  They had a dramatic music in the beginning with slow motion footage where it's a very special  episode of Mad About You.  It's a laugh, right?  You should have seen the commercial for it.  They say, like, Helen Hunt in a dramatic...  Because she won the Academy Award.  Yeah.  So now she's no longer funny, I guess.  She can't be funny. 
[00:36:00]  So now they've got some kind of problem where Paul Reiser's going to drop dead.  I am proud to say that I've never, ever sat through an entire episode of Mad About You.  Thank you.  It's supposed to be funny.  And I'm sure on this show, like, he'll be ready to die and she's crying.  And he's going, I love you, honey.  I love you.  Oh, please, please survive it.  And then he'll do something.  Oh, I hope I got a good doctor.  You know, like that nervous laughter in the middle of something that isn't funny.  Yeah.  And then by next week, they'll make believe that never happened. 
[00:36:30]  It never happened.  I hate when they do that.  Everything's fine now, honey.  Everything's fine.  Oh, yeah.  It's good.  I had a life-threatening illness last week, but now we're going to have some more wacky  baby fun.  Last week, I remember they took my liver out.  Now I'm fine.  Now we could be funny again.  And you know you're getting older.  Well, we're only six short years away from actually being able to have a legal threesome  with the Olsen twins.  Think about it.  Isn't that frightening? 
[00:37:00]  Six short years away from legally being able to bed the Olsen twins.  So how old are they?  And they were infants when that show was on.  What are they, like 10, 11 now already?  12 years old.  12 years old.  Okay.  The cute little Olsen twins have a new show on Friday.  It takes two, is it?  Or the two of us?  It's always some two thing.  Are they still cute?  I mean, what kind of topics are they going to tackle?  One of them is getting cuter than the other one, I've noticed.  Okay.  You know, and you can tell one's like going to be okay, and the other one might go down  the road. 
[00:37:30]  But one of them's looking okay.  I think in the premiere episode, they each get their period at the same time.  It's going to be cute.  One of them likes pads, and one likes tampons, so it's going to be a wacky, goofy show.  Best show on TV, period.  T-G-I-F.  There you go.  T-G-I-F.  Cute little show.  Well, that's wonderful.  Can't wait to go home and watch a little TV tonight.  Yeah, that's great.  My advice, watch the Yankees.  Get that Blockbuster account going. 
[00:38:00]  Get your Blockbuster video card.  Rent them.  Yeah, watch the Yankees.  Oh, and a real world is tonight.  I'm kind of losing interest.  You're losing interest in this season.  A real world started off real good.  Yeah.  But now it's kind of, I don't know.  Irene slapped, no, Stephen slapped Irene last week.  Slapped Irene last week.  That was pretty cool.  That was pretty intense.  You know what, though?  I can't get over the good one.  The one with Pac.  Yeah, San Francisco is by far the best one.  There was nothing better than Pac, Pac, I saw you. 
[00:38:30]  You pick your scales and then you put your finger in the peanut butter.  I saw.  I have a boyfriend, you know.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Before you move on, Pedro had worse problems than worried about a dirty finger in peanut butter.  Yeah, Pedro had AIDS.  He had full-blown AIDS and he's worried about a guy sticking his dirty fingers in peanut butter.  I mean, come on.  I think he should have worried more about something else being stuck somewhere else than fingers in peanut butter, Pedro.  Maybe they would have skirted a problem. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Then he got in a relationship.  I'm in a relationship right now.  You know, he's cute.  We're in love.  We're going to be married.  I cannot live in this environment.  This is not a healthy environment.  I'm going to have to lease the house.  It's either I go or fuck goes.  That was my favorite real world.  Yeah, that was the best by far.  But this one isn't bad, man.  Seattle's pretty cool.  Yeah, I'm kind of losing interest, though.  Irene called Steven out and said that he's gay.  And then Steven got really pissed and smacked her heart in the face. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  The girl calls him gay and he slaps her.  I'll slap you.  Call me gay.  All right.  So there's going to be some implications.  He might have to leave the show for hitting a girl.  What do you think is going to happen with that one, Anthony?  I just hope on one real world, maybe in years to come, there's no one left.  They all get thrown out and they just tape an empty house for months.  Actually, I wish they would do the real, real world and, you know, tape a bunch of guys living in their parents' house in the basement. 
[00:40:00]  You know, a bunch of guys that work at a deli.  Or paying rent.  Or paying rent.  Yeah, there's something that's actually real.  So, all right.  There you go.  I don't even know where we're going now.  I think we have to play music here.  Oh, that's probably a good idea.  Oh, yeah.  We do that on this show.  1027 WNNW, The Rock of New York with live on Two for Tuesday, all over you and selling the drama.  Selling the drama was the song you had to be listening for to score the tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard.  And Dave Mason of Valley Stream, New York, on the island, was listening and paying attention. 
[00:40:30]  And he's got a pair of tickets to see Kenny Wayne at a taping of VH1's Hard Rock Live presented by American Express and your friends at The Rock of New York.  1027 WNNW.  Very good.  Hey, you know, speaking of tickets.  Yeah.  I just noticed that we're giving away Aerosmith tickets beginning Friday at noon.  And we're going to do that all weekend long.  Wow.  That's a good deal.  That is huge for Tuesday, October 13th at Jones Beach.  What?  I just remembered last time we gave away Aerosmith tickets at the station we were at before we got fired. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know, because usually you give away tickets and people are very happy.  What, you know where it is?  Yeah, go ahead.  Tell the people.  People are very happy.  Like, I would be pleased to win Aerosmith tickets from a radio station.  Secondary is where the seats are.  Right.  You know, just the fact that you're going is pretty cool.  Yeah.  We gave away Aerosmith tickets.  I guess, what was that, a couple of years ago?  A couple of years back. 
[00:41:30]  And this woman calls up and we thought she was going to thank us for them and just starts ragging us because the seats weren't good enough for her.  They were what were called lawn seats on the venue.  Yeah.  Which, you know, you got a bunch of rows of seats and then there's a grass area where you can put out a blanket and grab, you know, a bottle, whatever, party with your friends.  It's pretty cool, as a matter of fact.  She didn't like them.  No, not at all.  Bring your binoculars.  It's going to be a good show.  I'll wave to you from the front row. 
[00:42:00]  So there you have it.  Wow.  But we are giving away Aerosmith tickets this Friday at noon and we'll do that all weekend long for you.  I'm sure.  She was appreciative, wasn't she?  Now that we work at this fine radio station that we will have very good seats for the show.  How's up, you're not singing happy birthday to me, huh?  What the hell?  Rick, you were supposed to watch the door.  It's my birthday.  Nice to meet you today.  It's my birthday.  You're not going to say happy birthday to me?  Happy birthday.  I thought Jesus was my pals.  Hi, happy birthday.  You're not going to sing me a song? 
[00:42:30]  No, I'm not going to sing you a song.  You've been waiting out there for four hours just to come in to have us wish you a happy birthday?  I thought you'd have a cake for me because Jesus is my pals.  I thought you'd have a birthday cake for me or something.  No, I'm sorry.  We don't, Dice.  Yeah.  What are you going to do for your birthday?  I don't think you have many friends.  I mean, where are you going to go?  I got plenty of friends.  Yeah.  I used to be somebody back in the 80s.  I packed out Madison Square Garden.  The key word.  You don't remember that?  The key words.  Used to.  I'm still playing.  I'm still packing clubs out. 
[00:43:00]  Can I plug?  Yeah.  All right.  Get a quick plug in for your birthday.  All right.  I'm going to be at Jimmy's Comedy Toilet and Jersey, and I'm going to be, I laughed so hard  I popped a nut in Poughkeepsie sometime next week.  They still got to verify.  All right.  But I'm still funny.  I'm still relevant.  I'm talking about all the big issues, Opie.  Yeah.  Do you have a joke about any of the big issues, Dice?  Well, how about the, we got Bill and Monica in the Oval Office.  Oh, yeah.  This is good stuff.  Hello, Bill Clinton, he's sitting in the Oval Office, and Monica comes in. 
[00:43:30]  He's, hey, Monica, how about you give me your Lewinsky?  And she goes, oh, but you're the president.  And Bill goes, get over here and she can bang.  Oh.  See, I still set him on fire laughing.  Dice, the problem is no one really wants to hear about the president.  It's been rehashed.  He goes to the bathroom.  He's in the bathroom next to the Oval Office with some chick.  And this chick looks up and goes, oh, Mr. President, why do you still stay with Hillary? 
[00:44:00]  He goes, because I could get a slut like you have.  Hey, Gibby.  Fun is to see you laughing your balls off.  That's how they're going to be at the comedy banana out of Trenton.  They're going to laugh your balls off.  Dice, we're laughing at you, not with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep saying that as long as you're laughing.  Yeah, okay.  So Bill Clinton, he's on Air Force One, right?  Yeah.  And the stewardess comes by, oh, Mr. President, would you like a drink?  Yeah, and wouldn't you like one? 
[00:44:30]  I'd be like, Aggie.  See, you're laughing your balls off at me.  Guys.  On my birthday.  Yeah, guys.  And by the way, they made a mistake.  Guys, just take them.  Just take them away.  I want to say they made a mistake on what the date my birthday is.  Take them away from the microphone.  They made a mistake on my birthday.  Take them away from the microphone.  I'm not 40.  I'm not 40.  Yeah, all right.  Get out of here, guys.  I'm 25.  Yeah, get out of here.  He's so rude.  He takes my mic.  I can't even talk.  Who let him in today?  We said we wouldn't have him in this week. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  All right, Matt.  Disinfect this thing, please.  Matt Devote's up next.  Matt, you giving away tickets?  Your mic's not on.  Just scream.  I don't know.  All right, Matt will figure it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. </pre>
