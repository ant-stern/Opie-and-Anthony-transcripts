<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about the death of Mr. Roper from *Three's Company*, featuring humorous and crude speculation about his sexuality and the show's suggestive undertones.  This segued into the "Tuesday Night Hummer Club," a listener segment encouraging listeners to have sex on Tuesdays and call in to report their experiences.  The hosts detailed the club's rules and purpose—reviving intimacy in relationships—and took calls from listeners describing their successes and seeking advice on engaging their partners.  Anthony interspersed the calls with snippets of 70s TV theme songs, particularly various versions of the *Alice* theme song, prompting a discussion about Linda Lavin's singing.  He also lamented his failed investment in Zoom.com stock.

One caller's participation in the Hummer Club led to a lengthy segment where Opie and Anthony called the caller's wife, employing suggestive and explicit language to encourage her participation.  A representative from Vital Transportation then joined the show, advertising their limousine services and offering a giveaway. Opie then played a recording of a previous call where he broke the news to a child that Santa Claus wasn't real.  The show concluded with final remarks about the Hummer Club and the day's events, followed by a Pepsi One advertisement.

Well, never knew who I had.  Kicking myself and nothing  was my favorite 
[00:09:00]  sport.  I had to get out and start  enjoying because life  is too short.  There's a new  girl. Here she goes.  Feeling good.  God!  Never  never knew  got it sound.  What was she thinking? 
[00:09:30]  The end's  even worse. Listen to this. Cover your  dog's ears. Here it comes.  So  whee!  Whee!  It's like the emergency broadcast test.  What you have to do.  All right.  See? That was one version.  Yes. And there's a total of three, you're saying.  Oh, yes, Hopi.  Yeah, listen to this.  We have to hear another one.  I used to be shy.  See, this is my daddy. 
[00:10:00]  That's it.  That is hard.  I never knew who I had.  Kicking myself and nothing.  I'm not right enough of her.  You'd be sick.  All right, Linda Lavin.  Thanks.  Different version, though.  Thanks for that lovely phone call.  Equally as hammy.  There's a new  girl in town  looking  God!  What the hell is that?  I have no idea, but...  Get a singer for your show.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday, Led Zeppelin, Travelin' Riverside Blues. 
[00:10:30]  Misty Mountain Hop before that from Zoso.  Some people like to call it Led Zeppelin 4.  I don't think the band actually named that album.  No.  Some people picked up that it said Zoso on the side of the CD and said,  it's called Zoso, man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  All right.  On the way, some twofers from Alice in Chains.  Rock!  Our listeners were bitching and complaining,  saying they don't hear enough Alice in Chains on NEW,  so we paid attention. 
[00:11:00]  We listened to you.  We'll do a twofer before the end of the hour.  Figging that.  And we got some Joe and Jed up next for you.  Got a fax here, Opie and Anthony.  Just so you know, Linda Lavin is still on TV.  Oh.  She plays the mother of the main character on NBC's bad new sitcom, Conrad Bloom.  What?  Like I said, she's not on TV anymore.  I swear to God, I've never heard of this sitcom.  Conrad Bloom?  Never heard of it.  And then Kathy goes on to say,  she doesn't sing, though. 
[00:11:30]  Thank God for small favors.  You guys are great.  Conrad Bloom?  Conrad Bloom.  I swear, I've never even heard the name.  All right.  There you go.  We learned something today.  Well, if she is still on TV,  she's not going to be for long.  I've never heard of that.  I don't know if anybody talking about that show  doesn't have a buzz to it.  No clue.  Oh, someone is on the line.  They just joined the club, Ant.  Oh, nice.  Hello.  Hello, Anthony.  Yes.  I am a new member of the Hummer Club. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  I'm the Hummer, and he is the Hummy.  When did it go down?  Three o'clock this afternoon.  Good job.  Right on the numbers.  Yeah.  First in for the week.  You're our first brand new member this week.  Why, thank you.  What's your name?  Mary.  Mary, what's his name?  Bob.  Bob.  Cool.  What were the details?  Oh, a little bath, a little shower, a little, you know.  Don't you guys have to work today? 
[00:12:30]  Well, he works nights, and I was off, so it's perfect.  That rocks.  Were you guys waiting all day until three o'clock to hit so you could become members?  I could stand it, yeah.  That's awesome.  Chomping at the bit, so to speak.  All right on.  So Middlesex County rocks on.  Cool.  I was calling from South River, New Jersey, and right now he's taking it easy.  He's probably napping. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, he is.  I'm having a cigarette.  God, look, I think we made you happy today.  I think so.  Oh, cool.  It's a definite deal.  Well, congratulations, guys.  Oh, radio.  Were you listening to the radio while I was going down?  Oh, that is so weird.  Oh, he's having on.  Yeah, that is a little bit loud.  Anthony and I are trying to figure out how many people are having sex while they listen to us.  All the time.  Oh.  Oh, it's awesome.  You've got to have that spirit to rock hard.  All right.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Two for Tuesday with Joan Jett. 
[00:13:30]  Little Drummer Boy and Anthony, the complaints are coming in about that song.  Yeah?  We're not allowed to talk bad about the music anymore, but...  Well, that's a Christmas song, so it's kind of seasonal, so maybe...  The song blows.  Let's just say that...  Horrible.  One of our favorites.  Are people, like, in their cars singing along and stuff, getting psyched for the holiday  because they just heard Joan Jett sing Little Drummer Boy?  Ugh. 
[00:14:00]  Ugh.  Yeah, not a fave.  And everyone's calling it bitching and complaining and saying,  don't you guys have anything better to play as far as holiday music?  I like the...  I just like the goof Christmas songs.  I just don't get into, like, all these bands, you know, with their Christmas songs.  Well, you liked Gary Hewie.  Yeah, because it was different, though.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Because he was...  It rocked.  He was jamming, and you're like, how the hell is this guy going to play the Grinch Christmas 
[00:14:30]  song on a guitar?  And he pulled it off.  That's why I liked it.  It was totally different and new and exciting.  Doing the 12 Days of Christmas on a guitar.  Try to figure that at home if you're a guitar player.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Yeah, you're right.  I did like that.  So, people are requesting our Christmas songs.  Maybe we could play that here.  Yeah, it's a good, goofy song.  I think it's better than The Little Drummer Boy by Joan Jett.  Definitely.  There you go.  Now, that makes me laugh.  It puts me in the spirit to run around from mall to mall to try to get my Christmas shopping 
[00:15:00]  done.  Really?  Not Joan Jett, Little Drummer Boy.  Please.  And your brother did a great job on that song.  Yes.  Yes, he did.  Anthony's brother, Joe, on lead vocals for the Grandma song that he could find on  Opie and Anthony's Demander World CD.  Good luck trying to find that this holiday season.  A lot of people calling in saying, hey, congratulations.  You finally figured out a bet last night.  Yes, I did.  You picked the Niners.  Man, they won.  They won.  They kicked ass.  In all fairness, not the hardest bet to make, but... 
[00:15:30]  Oh, right.  Well, we'll accept it.  And the Giants...  Wait.  And the Giants-Denver thing was a hard one?  You're like, oh, 49ers over the Lions.  Not a hard bet.  No, I'm just saying the obvious.  You know, a lot of people took the Niners and gave the points last night.  It's the same thing with the Giants.  I'm just busting your balls.  Damn.  You went on a limb and said that the Broncos would beat the Giants. 
[00:16:00]  All right, so you're right.  Oops.  How's your Zoom.com doing today?  Well, I don't even want to talk about it.  Why?  Well, I...  Well, first of all, what did the market do today?  Did we kind of survive?  I know it was up a lot earlier in the day.  Yes, I think we muddled through today, Opie.  Mm-hmm.  But, um...  The market's just having a horrible couple weeks.  Yes.  I may have made a...  Oh, wow.  It's way up.  Yeah.  Closed at 127. 
[00:16:30]  127.  127.  Okay.  Very good.  And, uh...  I got rid of my Zoom.  It's all-time low, and it went up today.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Let's follow the story of Anthony and Zoom.com.  Oh, no.  Four days ago, you bought Zoom at how much?  38.  Zoom.com at 38.  Okay.  You sold it when?  Yesterday?  Yeah.  At what?  Like 21.  21?  21?  You lost 17 points in, what, three days? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, now it's going back up.  You're kidding, right?  What did Zoom.com close at today?  Oh.  What did it close at?  It's like 23.  Oh, my gosh.  Around there somewhere.  And you sold it when?  No, that's the way to go, though.  You buy high and sell low.  No, that's a great strategy you got there, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I should jump back on it. 
[00:17:30]  You might as well.  You might as well.  You're going to jinx it, but give it a try.  Oh, brother.  So you bought it at 38.  You sold it at 21, and today it's up to 23.  I better quit this game, huh?  I don't think I'm any good at this.  Well, the stock market might not be your cup of tea.  Not my cup of tea.  I'll go back to the track.  Let's stick with the Half-Life game that you play.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there we go.  1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York. 
[00:18:00]  Two for Tuesday with Alice in Chains for the Unplugged CD.  What a great CD that is.  Over now, and no excuses from Jar of Flies before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  And everyone is calling up about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Of course.  And we've got a bunch of guys standing by on hold.  They need our help today, Anthony.  Well, that's what we like to do on Tuesday.  We call up the significant other.  And give a helping hand.  Yes.  As they say.  Yes.  And let the girls know what the guy wants. 
[00:18:30]  Tactfully.  Mm-hmm.  Of course.  And most of the time, we're successful.  Mm-hmm.  The last couple of weeks, we haven't been quite as successful as we'd like to be.  Right.  I think a couple of couples are heading toward divorce courts because of the phone calls  we made the last couple of weeks.  But in general, we do get the deed accomplished for the guys.  Mm-hmm.  And there's a bunch of people just calling in the middle of the act and stuff.  It's like, okay, we know you're becoming members while we're on the air.  Call us after it's done. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, we don't want to hear it during.  No, we don't want to hear it.  Well, it's, yeah, exactly.  Okay, thank you.  Two for Tuesday with Pink Floyd on the Rock of New York.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, you're taking the ride home with Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And new members are joining the Tuesday Night Hummer Club as we speak.  A lot of you guys on the highway as you drive home.  Thanks for letting us know about that.  Just keep the car between the lines, okay?  Yeah.  And at this point, I guess it's time to try to help a couple out there, Anthony.  We like to do this every week. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, we get in there and try to get the couple some action.  Yes.  Yeah, it might have changed a little since you've been married, and we like to get in  there and shake things up again.  We get close to 100 people contacting us every week, begging us to talk to the wife or the  girlfriend or other guys, actually.  Guys begging us to talk to other guys for them.  This club is for everyone, I guess. 
[00:20:00]  Isn't that fascinating?  It's quite fascinating.  We've got to do that one of these days.  We'll do the guy-guy thing one of these days.  Jeez.  Have fun.  We've got to.  It would be sick, but it would be funny to sit through that.  I think a lot of people would check it out just for the hell of it.  But, yeah, we get you guys contacting us all week long with your sob stories, and you basically  say that you just don't know how to bring it up anymore. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, it's very hard.  Very hard to just bring up in conversation.  We need an icebreaker.  That's what we're doing.  And a lot of the emails and letters and stuff start to say, you know, when we first started  dating, when we first started dating, there's always that line, things were great.  We had monkey sex on the subway.  We would do it on the couch while her parents were in the other room.  Oh, jeez.  We went downstairs to do the laundry.  That's what they thought we were doing down there, you know?  But then time passed, and I got two jobs, and she's working and trying to raise the kids. 
[00:21:00]  And now our mother-in-law lives with us.  All these just horror stories.  Yeah.  So that's why we started the Tuesday Night Harmer Club.  We figured we'd put it right out in the open for everyone.  Right.  All right, so let's talk to Stephen here and see if we can help him out.  Steve, I hear you need our help trying to get your wife into the Tuesday Night Harmer Club thing.  Oh, most definitely.  She ain't buying it at all.  She thinks I'm making the whole thing up.  And I put you guys on to have her listen to when you guys were already off last week.  Ah, well, the key is to get her to listen to us while we're on the air. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, that usually helps.  Well, where is she right now?  She should be home.  She's not home.  She's just outspending more of my money, which that ain't too good.  All right.  When was the last time you had a home?  We're talking months.  We're back in June, maybe.  Okay.  It's been a while.  And why don't you guys get it on?  Ah, well, she was saying that she didn't like the way...  Well, can I say c***?  I guess I can say c*** now, huh?  I shouldn't say she doesn't like the way my c*** needs.  I'm drinking beer.  So I quit drinking.  You know?  And it's still nothing. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I got the herbs still, but...  All right.  All right.  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  A little too much information there, Stevie.  All right.  All right.  Let's give her a call here.  What's her name?  Roseanne.  All right, Stevie.  Let us do all the talking, but you'll be able to listen in, okay?  You got it.  All right.  Hold on.  Hello?  Roseanne.  Yes?  Hi, it's Opie and Anthony from WNEW Radio.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Good.  Your husband told us to give you a call.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  Okay.  Do you know why he told us to give you a call? 
[00:22:30]  I have not a clue.  Do you listen to the show at all?  When I can.  Yes, I do.  All right.  You know what Tuesday is?  Uh...  Nope.  Hmm.  Why do you laugh when you say that?  I don't know.  What am I supposed to know, I guess, right?  No.  Why do you laugh when you say that?  Do you have an idea?  No.  Yes, you do.  No, I really don't.  Maybe not.  Because Steve also said that he talked to you about it, and you didn't believe him. 
[00:23:00]  No, I didn't.  All right.  Well, we did start the club, the Tuesday Night at Hummer Club.  Is this ringing a bell now?  Yeah, now it's ringing a bell.  All right.  And we're crazy enough to actually start this club.  Uh-huh.  It's just a way to get couples together, to break the ice.  Okay.  Yeah.  When was the last time you gave him a homework?  Excuse me?  Opie, you've got to be a little more tactful here.  All right.  Well, you try.  Let's just...  Okay.  So how long have you kids been married?  Almost four years.  And I heard a little toddler in the background? 
[00:23:30]  Yes, you did.  So when was the last time you hobbed his dad?  Oh, Opie, Opie, please.  What?  Please accept my apology.  I don't even know what to say.  So, you have a child, too, huh?  Yes, we do.  All right.  That should be a good clue.  Yeah.  And things might have changed since you first got married, right?  Uh, yeah.  Well, that happens with everybody.  Have you buffed his helmet lately?  Oh.  I'm sorry, have I what?  Oh.  Bring him right here, sweetheart.  Oh, see, this is the type of stuff that kind of gets in the way of your relationship being 
[00:24:00]  the way it used to be.  And guys have a hard time asking for a certain thing that is very special to us.  Uh-huh.  The, uh, the Hummer.  So, we're saying that on Tuesdays, maybe the women in the relationship can give the men  a Hummer, thus breaking the ice and getting those wild, crazy, uh, sexual days back again.  Oh, okay. 
[00:24:30]  That's not my grandma.  No, it's not grandma.  Oh, no.  No, it's not grandma.  I can't really talk about Hummers when, oh, no.  How can we possibly do that with a kid right there?  Like, really?  I'm not even that sick.  Is it grandma?  Oh, oh, man.  Well, well, Roseanne, what do you think the, uh, the chances are of, uh, making Stephen a  member tonight?  Oh, I think we could probably swing something.  All right.  All right.  It'd make him very happy. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, good.  I'm glad.  It just, we're trying to make the world a happier place, and I think that's one way to  start.  That's wonderful.  You guys are really something.  Well, we try to be tactful, but it just never works.  Okay.  Well, listen, I just have one question for you.  Yeah.  What's in it for the women?  Anything?  Well, we do, we do, uh, encourage reciprocation.  Oh, okay.  Whatever that means.  Whatever you're into.  I know pretty much every guy is into Hummers, and women, uh, they're different. 
[00:25:30]  Some are into whatever.  Okay.  But if there's a guaranteed Hummer in it, I'm sure the guy will, you can go for anything,  you know?  Actually, Stephen.  Yeah.  Your husband's on the line, Roseanne.  I'm sure he is.  Hello, darling.  Hello, darling.  See, this is what it takes?  I tried to tell you, this is a real s***.  I didn't believe it.  Yeah, well, now you do.  Okay.  See, you didn't believe it, huh?  No, I didn't.  Woo!  Hummer, baby!  Well, there you go.  We accomplished a feat for you guys.  Beautiful deal, guys.  Well, have fun and let us know how it turns out tomorrow. 
[00:26:00]  Most definitely.  All right, man.  Grandma!  No, it's not Grandma!  O.P. and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday, Jimi Hendrix, Dolly Dagger.  I don't think I've ever played that song on the radio.  No?  Sounded good, though, man.  We're doing different things here at N-E-W, and are you experienced before that?  We're going to send that out to Brian and Gene and the rest of the gang at Centerport Deli.  They've been with us from the beginning, and we appreciate it, boys.  Thanks for checking in.  Yes.  Another Long Islander has joined the N-E-W staff, Anthony. 
[00:26:30]  Uh-huh.  Our pal and our friend, Ralph Titora.  We're very excited to announce that he is now doing the shift right before us here at N-E-W.  You were co-workers for a while, weren't you?  We were co-workers on Long Island for like three, three and a half years.  Yeah.  And I grew up cutting class high school and tuning in Ralph as we're drinking our beers in the parking lot of Harborfields High School.  So I go way back with Ralph Titora.  Yeah.  And it's the first time I feel like the station is finally moving forward. 
[00:27:00]  Here we go.  Here we go.  We're moving.  The process has begun.  Got a new morning show coming in soon.  We'll have details on that, and that's a very exciting thing as well.  Uh-huh.  So please keep listening to N-E-W.  It's only going to get better from here.  Yeah, we don't do these things overnight.  No.  Slow, arduous process.  Overnight.  You know, it's our six-month anniversary today.  I'm doing Afternoon Drive in New York City.  Are you kidding me?  Six months.  We've been here six months.  Feels like five years.  I know. 
[00:27:30]  It's been a long six months, but we are definitely starting to have a lot of fun.  I feel like I've aged five years, man.  Yeah, I know.  And Ralph the Tourer takes you through the world's largest rock library with the online  archives weekdays at noon.  A new feature that he brought to N-E-W, and it's pretty cool.  He's featuring great guitars this week, so make sure you check out Ralph tomorrow at  noon, okay?  Rock.  Anthony, I got another telemarketer call.  I forgot to tell you.  Which one is this?  This is a new one.  What do you got? 
[00:28:00]  Well, as probably a lot of the faithful listeners know by now, I'm sick of the telemarketers.  Yeah.  So I've turned the tide on them because they refuse to stop calling me.  I've tried all the tricks.  You know, take my name off your list.  Nothing works.  Nothing.  So I tape them, and I mess with them a bit.  All right.  This one, I will warn people ahead of time, is a bit harsh.  Like the other ones aren't.  Yeah.  A bit harsh.  A bit edgy.  If you're going to be easily offended, turn over to Fat Rocky and make a bid on a Furby 
[00:28:30]  doll or whatever the stupid thing you're doing.  Hey, we got Furbies.  What will you do for a Furby doll?  For a Furby.  Hey, we're going to...  You have to try to tell us what the little Furby's saying to win the Furby.  I know some stupid station in this town is doing that bit, so...  Of course.  I wouldn't doubt it if it was him.  But anyway, so this lady calls from a bank.  The bank I go to.  A bank?  Yes. 
[00:29:00]  I don't think I've ever gotten a telemarketer call from a bank.  Well, they're calling their customers to see how the service is.  Oh, oh.  You know, one of those service surveys.  Right.  So they ask you a bunch of questions, and between a scale of like one to ten, you've got to rate  the service.  Okay.  Like how is the teller, where you're greeted, where you're, you know, taking care of with  everything you needed, all that crap.  I've heard of those.  Okay.  And you sit home and you rate them.  Well, this gets way out of hand.  Take a listen.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York. 
[00:29:30]  Rolling Stones, two for Tuesday, rocking a hard place, and the love is strong.  Those bastards aren't coming to New York, huh?  Hartford is the closest they're coming on their next tour.  Great.  No New York, huh?  Thanks for taking care of us, Mick.  You're only in this city every other weekend doing our broads.  You can't play for us?  It's not a big city or anything.  Yeah.  Skip the little, the cute little town of New York, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Great.  Why aren't they playing New York? 
[00:30:00]  There's no basketball.  I'm sure they could get some dates at the Garden.  Oh, that's a good question.  It's pathetic.  I guess we've got to get them broads.  Broads.  Mixed broads.  Do we even use the term broads in the late 90s?  Yes, I think that's the term now that we use, yes.  Broads.  It's open, Anthony.  I want to congratulate all the new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, everyone.  Yay!  Good job.  Good job.  Good job, people.  Is Ben in it yet? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  We're going to talk to Ben.  Who the hell are you, first of all?  Yeah, really.  This guy has been, like, sitting here for the last three hours.  We don't even know who you are.  Two and a half hours.  Two and a half hours.  I'm Anthony from Vital Transportation.  I'm one of your sponsors.  Oh, crap.  You guys want me out of here right now?  We hate our sponsors.  It's like we're under a constant state of blackmail.  No, we love our sponsors.  Yes.  Yes, we do.  And what do you do?  We have a limousine company in Manhattan. 
[00:31:00]  I have 350 sedans and 100 limousines.  And Lisa Orban was nice enough to solicit me, and we're one of your sponsors now.  We start in the third week of January.  Hey, congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Do you have those cars that the guys drive around and cut everybody off with?  Oh, definitely.  The guy goes, I don't know where I'm going.  Where do I go?  He's on the air.  He has no idea.  Some of those drivers are worse than the cabbies.  Some of them.  My guys are all right.  They're all right.  They don't smell.  How's that?  You don't have any of those livery cabs, do you?  No.  I hate the livery cabs. 
[00:31:30]  They're all sedans.  They're all limousines.  They've got 350 sedans, 100 limousines.  In fact, we're going to send, I guess, a couple.  Yeah, you're sending a couple home.  Yes.  Your friend's yours, right?  From Boston, John.  Yeah, John and his lovely girlfriend, Tanya.  I don't think she's from Boston, though.  No, she's from London.  You want to hear a little accent?  Yeah, listen to this great accent.  Come on, Tanya.  Say hi.  Hello.  Don't you love that?  Hey, what do you call pants?  Trousers.  Or?  Or? 
[00:32:00]  No, that's me.  No, say it.  Go ahead.  Knickers.  She thinks knickers is rude?  She thinks the word knickers is rude.  Are you serious?  Come on.  Rick wants some.  Rick said, you know, maybe on the way home that he can get into the Hummer Club tonight.  You never know.  Well, I'll find out later, and then we'll discuss it tomorrow.  But, all right.  Do you get those big-ass limos that are like a block long?  How long are these limos going to get before they break in half?  I got a 14 passenger.  That sits there. 
[00:32:30]  It's the size of a van.  You can, it's got, it's everything.  You got, you got the soda machine, the sink, the toilet.  It's all around.  Soda machine?  It's a limo.  What the hell happened to the limos?  Great.  They got a hot tub in the middle, and, you know.  I brought him a shirt.  I brought Anthony a shirt for Joe DiMaggio.  I figured.  How am I supposed to wear this?  Where can I possibly?  Let me explain really fast.  He brought presents in for everyone.  He brought Ben, who was with that transsexual over the weekend. 
[00:33:00]  I guess officially he didn't do much with the transsexual, so he says.  So what'd you bring him?  I brought him an escort service book, you know, for S&M.  And, you know, I figured if Ben wants to have some girl call up, hopefully she'll be a girl, not a man with a mustache.  And I told Ben, you know, call up, see how much it's going to cost you.  We'll put it on a credit card and see if he can get satisfied for the evening.  All right.  So you brought that for Ben.  For Anthony, you got him a T-shirt.  I brought it all.  Did you see what I brought it all?  I brought it all a Giants yearbook and some rolling papers. 
[00:33:30]  I got the Jolton Joe DiMaggio.  You got the Jolton Joe DiMaggio.  It's a death watch shirt.  Every day Anthony's sitting there saying, you know, this guy's dying.  Now he's walking.  Now he might be dying.  So I had him every day, a different condition.  One day is fair.  It's, I think, more tasteless than anything I said.  Okay.  But hey, what the hell?  Thanks.  And where's the Tuesday Night Homer shirts you got?  Tuesday Night Homer shirts are right here.  All right.  This is for you.  It's like Christmas in here, Opie. 
[00:34:00]  Cute.  Can I say happy birthday to my son?  He's one year old today.  Security.  Security.  Security.  I'm going to kill Lisa.  I'm going to kill Lisa.  I can't wear this.  I can't wear this.  It's got sexual positions all over the back.  And it says on the front, if Wednesday is hump day, then Tuesday is Hummer day.  I can't.  Where am I going to wear this, dude?  I, you know, you want to make your lawn.  There's all kinds of sexual positions on the back of the shirt. 
[00:34:30]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven Hummer positions on the back of the shirt.  Correct.  There you go.  Two.  Is that a horsetail?  Oh, that's her hair.  Wow.  Okay.  I don't know.  The guy had a horsetail on.  Yeah, but that's not her hair.  All right.  Wow.  Well, thanks.  This is just like Christmas.  You're welcome.  Thank you guys for having me on.  Okay.  Thanks for letting me sit outside for a couple hours.  I also brought you a free $50 Feels for Meals traveler's check for the first 50 people. 
[00:35:00]  They get free feels.  Yeah.  Vital Transportation is donating that to them.  Okay.  Yeah, we are trying to get the Feels for Meals thing together, but all right.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Great.  I hope I didn't ruin the show.  No, you're fine.  No, no.  We were ruined well before you came in today.  I asked you guys if you want.  We're going to go to the Super Bowl, so I would like to call you guys from the Super Bowl and  give you a traffic report in regards to the limousines and everything else. 
[00:35:30]  What's going on?  Well, we can resolve.  With locations all over New York, Dwayne Reed has your holiday shopping challenge.  All wrapped up.  Everywhere you go.  A gift certificate for MusicBoulevard.com, the world's number one online music store.  That beats wouldn't change.  Oh, shut up.  Blue clock.  The MindSpring Holiday Offer.  Call toll-free 1-888-MSPRING.  Limited time only while supplies last.  MindSpring.  Internet services designed with you in mind. 
[00:36:00]  1-888-MSPRING.  It's two for Tuesday with Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  This is Everything is...  That's so high, baby.  Never gonna take a door.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Still nothing at my door.  I was duped.  Stepping all over the guy, man. 
[00:36:30]  I screwed that one up.  I'd like to have that one back.  Two for Tuesday with Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Aberdeen, off his CD, Ledbetter Heights, and everything  is broken.  The old Dylan song before that, Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  It's Hopi and Anthony, and I hope you had fun listening.  Yeah.  We're out the door.  Just about, huh?  Got to get out of here.  Got to get home.  Got to welcome everyone to the Tuesday Night Armor Club.  A lot of new memberships were, uh...  Be gone today?  Yes, yes.  One thing I'd just like to play. 
[00:37:00]  What?  A little thing.  You have nothing.  Fun little...  Fun little holiday ditty.  You have nothing.  What are you getting at?  This is funny, I think.  What's funny?  It's, uh...  It's you.  It's a tape of you.  Dude, you've been trying to play this tape for about a week now.  Well, what, am I going to wait until Christmas is over?  Nah.  Just a fun holiday little bit. 
[00:37:30]  Here's Hopi.  Live on the phone telling a small child.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm reforming.  No, cut it out.  No one wants to hear this phone call.  I do.  I do, too.  Everyone does.  That was a good phone call.  That there is no...  Rick, you want to hear it, too?  I want to hear it.  No.  That's cruel.  S-A-N-T-A.  You're a sick man.  Come on. 
[00:38:00]  Not right.  My poor son.  Thank God he's only one.  Come on, man.  Play it.  This is the old me, though.  Come on, man.  Okay.  This is Hopi from a few years back when he had some issues, I guess.  Well, this kid...  And he felt compelled to tell a small child that there was a...  No Santa Claus.  Oh!  Just did it again!  No kiddies.  Of course there is.  Santa will be bringing you gifts.  No, let me explain myself.  I said... 
[00:38:30]  This always works.  When I finally have kids someday...  Yeah.  And then I'm going to tell them right off the bat there's no Santa because I want the credit.  I worked, you know, worked two jobs, worked my butt off, and I never understood that growing  up that my parents sat there and kept their mouths shut as we opened up, you know, just  tons and tons of toys.  Right.  And they never got the credit.  Uh-huh.  I want the credit.  So he took it a step further and did this.  Well, no.  Felt compelled to tell a small child.  So we were talking about Santa on the air, and then a bunch of people called, freaking 
[00:39:00]  out and really pissed because their kids were listening to the radio, and I was the one  that broke the news to them.  Exactly.  And they didn't appreciate that.  Instead of saying, okay, well, thank you, and hanging up.  Which I did in this call.  You'll hear that.  Oh, yeah.  No, you begged the guy to put his kid on the phone.  You are going to wreck me.  I will not be able to leave my house.  It was Opie from a while ago.  Come on.  It's funny.  Who cares?  And now this kid has grown up, and he has a family of his own, and he's okay. 
[00:39:30]  What?  He's okay.  Wow, really?  Only in the two, three years that it's been?  No, this happened 22 years ago.  Oh, right.  I'm actually very old.  This is the old me, and now I'm the new me, and this kid is okay.  He's well-adjusted, even though I said this to him.  Well, let's just throw this out there, and the people can judge.  Oh, yeah.  I was just listening to your station a little while ago.  Yeah.  And I had my three-year-old son with me, and you guys were putting down the Santa Claus thing, 
[00:40:00]  and oh, it's just your parents and all that.  Yeah.  And, you know, I love Opie and Anthony, you know,  and I'm a faithful listener, but I had to change the station.  Oh, that's okay.  You're doing parenting, that's called, when you change the station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, I detect that you're a little pissed at us because we just said that there's  no Santa Claus on the air.  Well, it'd be one thing if it was, you know, a little later at night, and there wouldn't  happen to have been someone's kid listening, you know?  Dude, I'd just save you the hassle.  Now you can get the credit for all those presents you bought for him. 
[00:40:30]  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't, actually.  I changed the station in time where he didn't pick up on it because he was busy doing something  else.  Hey, what's your son's name?  It's Jeffrey.  Can I talk to him real fast?  Why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not going to say anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right, where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him.  What can I have to say to you?  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus. 
[00:41:00]  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  That's your dad.  No.  Oh, no.  Heartless.  Come on, that can't be real.  Come on.  Great, huh?  There's your poo bomb.  God, that is fun.  You're a cruel man.  What?  May I?  May I?  Yeah.  No.  First of all, how come everyone you got on the phone is either going, no, or, oh, no. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, Bill's dead.  But I was cheap.  Oh, no.  No.  You're slinking away.  Listen, man.  Poor kid.  The mother and father, you know, how stupid are they?  Pretty damn stupid.  I'll give you that.  Thank you.  They had to be really stupid and put you on the phone.  Well, thanks for wrecking my life, Ant.  Appreciate it.  That was great.  All right.  A little holiday call.  It's a little holiday cheer.  Yeah, cute.  Let's follow it up with, do they know it's Christmas now? 
[00:42:00]  I'm just sitting on the couch right now.  Daddy, is there really not a Santa Claus?  Is there really you?  Anthony, Pepsi One.  Opie?  Yes.  I am proud that the fine people at Pepsi decided to advertise on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  Are they crazy?  They got a brand new product, Pepsi One, and we tried it yesterday for the first time.  Pepsi One.  I hate diet soda.  I was raised with my mother always having diet soda in the refrigerator, and it was terrible. 
[00:42:30]  I'd go to my friend's house and get real soda because it tasted better.  You could just tell when it was diet.  Yeah.  So when I get this Pepsi One yesterday, I'm like, oh, another one.  Okay, bring it on.  I've had the NutraSweet.  I've had everything else.  Bring it on because this has a new sweetener.  So I drink it on.  All right.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's pretty good.  It wasn't bad.  And it was.  And I'm the biggest critic because I hate diet soda.  So if you're one of those big fat women that eat like crazy, they get... 
[00:43:00]  Well, you ever see it?  They get all the food, and then they get the diet drink?  Yes.  Get the Pepsi One because at least it'll taste good.  I'll go one step further.  I didn't even know it was a diet cola.  Yeah.  No clue.  I just started drinking it because I was choking on my lunch.  I go, all right, let me try this Pepsi One.  Yeah.  And I honestly just thought it was a brand new sweetener.  I didn't realize it was a diet product, and I was happy with it.  Seriously, if you've got to drop weight or you don't have to, if you just want something 
[00:43:30]  that tastes good, I'd recommend this.  Colette.  Yeah.  Say Ralph Datorra one more time.  Ralph Datorra.  Now she's trying to say it right.  Where's this chick from?  Where are you from, Colette?  France.  France.  France.  It's very obvious.  And she just found out that Ralph Datorra, who used to work on Long Island, is now working  here at N.E.W. doing the shift before us.  And we didn't understand she was talking about him because she said, I was like, I don't  know. 
[00:44:00]  It sounds like a disease, the way you say it.  Now, Colette, say his name again.  Okay, Ralph Datorra.  All right.  Are you going to call him tomorrow and welcome him aboard?  Yay.  Yeah.  A lot of the Long Islanders are very psyched that Ralph is now here at N.E.W.  So, check him out.  Look how excited he is.  Monday through Friday from 12 to 3.  It's a literal meaning of French dip.  Oh, right.  I've gotten those at the diner occasionally.  Now, we have one on the phone.  That's a nice Christmas gift. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You want to do them or something?  I mean, why are you that excited?  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  All right.  I'll stick to you.  All right, Frenchie.  Bye.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Call Ralphie tomorrow.  Okay.  What did she say again?  All right, later.  Bye.  Let's get the hell out of here, Anthony.  I'm gone. </pre>
