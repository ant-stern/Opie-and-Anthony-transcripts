<pre> One oh two seven WNEW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with R.E.M.  That's Driver Eight and what's the frequency?  Kenneth from Monster before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey man.  And kind of bummed, Mr. Roper died.  Yeah, how about that, huh?  Mr. Roper.  That was one of my favorite shows growing up, my dear company.  Three's Company.  Was it?  Yeah.  I didn't like it that much.  Why?  I don't know.  It was kind of gay.  I kind of liked the... 
[00:30]
 It was kind of gay.  The cans that were always jiggling around.  That was kind of cool.  Not Suzanne Somers?  Yeah.  She was like the worst actress.  I know, but you know why she got the job.  Yeah, I could figure that out.  Mr. Roper, his whole big deal was that he never gave his wife sex and his wife would  always make these little innuendos that she was never getting any.  Mr. Roper would make little jokes and look at the camera and then laugh.  Awful show.  She wanted Jack. 
[01:00]
 And he thought Jack was a homo.  That's why he let him live in the building with two girls.  Oh, wild show.  Pretty risque for the late 70s, I guess.  Hey Jack, but we know what you're into.  Oh, everyone laughs.  Oh yeah.  And the whole thing was, I even thought he was gay.  He looked at everyone.  If you're going to have a guy trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes, he's gay.  Make him look not so gay when he doesn't have to be gay.  Right. 
[01:30]
 He's true.  He always looked gay.  You know that Mr. Roper was only 74 years old?  He looked a lot older than that.  We did.  It looked like he was in his 70s during the show.  Right?  So, well we're mourning the death of Mr. Roper on the Opient Anthony show today.  It's kind of a bone support of our childhood, I guess, in a way.  Come and knock on our door.  We've been waiting for you.  Yeah, I can find that theme if you want, Anthony.  Where the kisses are hers and hers and his.  Mr. Roper's dead too.  Yeah, he died of cancer.  He did?  Yeah. 
[02:00]
 Uh-oh.  And he was in one of those Hollywood retirement homes.  He smoked a lot, didn't he?  Yes, he did.  Uh-oh.  Here's to Mr. Roper.  Come and knock on our door.  We've been waiting for you.  Come and knock on our door.  Mr. Roper.  Come and knock on our door.  Mr. Roper.  Come and knock on our door.  Mr. Roper.  Come and knock on our door.  Mr. Roper.  Come and knock on our door.  Mr. Roper.  Come and knock on our door.  We've been waiting for you.  We've been waiting for you.  Where the kisses are hers and hers and his.  Please, come and eat you.  Come and dance on our floor. 
[02:30]
 Dance on our floor.  Take a test of it now.  You've got a little face that needs your face.  Please, come and eat you.  You'll see that my miserable again.  Roper is going for you.  Come and knock on our door.  Please, come and eat you.  Come and knock on our door.  Come and knock on our door.  Come on, Jack.  Jack, you're a homo. 
[03:00]
 Jack, he's not sleeping with the girls because he's a homo.  That's horrible.  No, Mrs. Roper, you're not going to get the big slung tonight.  Are you done with your tribute to Mr. Roper?  Come and knock on our door.  Take a test of it now. 
[03:30]
 Where the kisses are hers and hers and his.  Please, come and eat you.  That's a cute little tribute there, Anthony.  Yes.  Also, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah, welcome.  We're up and running.  Yes, we are up and running and we are getting new members as we speak.  That's right.  We initiate new members starting at 3 every Tuesday for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  You're still Poohba? 
[04:00]
 Is that how it's working?  I'm still Poohba.  This is your last week of suspension.  Next week you'll be back in the club and then you can maybe break out your cute little  tape or something.  I will.  That's what I'm waiting for.  All right.  I'll prove you wrong.  We're just getting warmed up.  If you've got a fax to send us, we'd love to read it.  212-957-WNEW.  The phone line is 212-757-1027.  And we've got the instant feedback set and ready to go in.  WNEW, Doc.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York Bad Company shooting star on Tuesday.  On the way, some Led Zeppelin and the Who by request.  You're hanging with Opie and the Who. 
[04:30]
 We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  All right.  Thanks, Anthony.  Phones ring like crazy today.  Everyone's talking about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  And it's really simple.  Everyone has questions every week about this damn club of ours, Anthony.  The rules are simple.  You've got to get a Hummer on Tuesday between the hours of three and midnight.  That's it.  And then you become a member of the club.  And yes, both parties become members of the club. 
[05:00]
 What is that noise?  A computer problem.  All right.  Let me put that down for now.  But everyone's calling in.  Yeah.  Does it count if I get my Hummer on Sunday?  No.  No.  It's the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Everybody knows how it works.  And it's quite simple.  And we started this club to maybe get some sparks back into the relationships out there  because we pretty much did a survey.  Yeah.  And we found that a lot of people that have been married for quite a while, and some that 
[05:30]
 haven't been married that long, kind of lost the spark.  And guys find it hard to ask for that oh-so-precious experience.  Right.  The Hummer.  And we apologize for putting all this in the ladies' lap.  But someone has to get this started.  Yeah.  And you ladies are good at getting things started.  Right.  So it's simple as that.  You know, guys, if you've got a lady out there that you need help with, maybe give her a  call right now and make sure she listens to our show today because off and on we'll be  talking about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[06:00]
 They could bring it up tonight at dinner or something and maybe it'll get the ball rolling.  Talk about what those wacky guys did on the radio today and how silly and stupid this  Tuesday Night Hummer Club thing is.  And next thing you know, something might be happening.  It's an icebreaker.  Yes.  And later on we might pick Sad Sap from our audience and call his significant other.  Yes.  And see if we can hook him up.  Yes.  Give it that hands-on help that some people need.  Was it last week that we had the cold fish or was that the week before already?  I think two weeks in a row we've been screwed here. 
[06:30]
 We had three weeks that we just ripped and then two weeks, nothing.  Nothing.  Yeah.  We made people's lives even worse.  Where the guy got home, you call a radio station again and tell them I don't give you.  It's all over.  All right.  So we'll get into that.  If you've got a sad story, you can fax us.  212-957-WNOW.  The phone's ringing like crazy.  Let's grab one here.  Hi, NAW.  I want to know, Anthony is singing 70s TV theme song. 
[07:00]
 Yeah.  If he could do the Alice one again.  Well, you know something?  I've discovered there are three different versions of the Alice songs.  Oh, yeah?  I was singing the wrong one.  Really?  Yeah.  There's one that really gets out of hand.  What did you do there?  Where she really, there's a new girl in town and she's looking good.  Like really gets out of control.  We might have to break that out.  We mean there were three versions.  There's three versions.  I only remember one.  Yeah, we all remember just the one. 
[07:30]
 Don't make me punch it up.  I'll do it.  Oh, he's going to punch it up now because of you.  I'll do it.  That would be great because I really need a good laugh.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  Bye.  I could have sworn that there's only one version, Anthony.  No, but you might remember that we played the original version.  Linda Lavin is the worst singer ever.  She decides she's going to sing the theme song to our TV show, Alice.  It was bad enough in the 70s.  I think E plays it early in the morning.  Sometimes I fall asleep with Eon.  I wake up to Linda Lavin, that bad schlock jazz lounge singer thing that she was trying 
[08:00]
 to pull off.  It's just awful.  The first one, you might remember, it was early to rise, early to bed.  In between I cooked and cleaned away that in my head.  There's a new girl in town and she's looking good.  She's got us.  She's just screaming.  Very exaggerated.  Then I get an email from some guy going, there's another version with different words and everything. 
[08:30]
 I don't remember another version.  All right.  Here, I will pop it up for you.  Okay.  Here it goes.  A little cheesy version.  See?  Used to be sad.  Used to be shy.  Let's see, she gets out of hand.  The funniest thing, the saddest part is I never knew.  I never knew.  Kicking myself in nothing was my favorite sport. 
[09:00]
 I had to get out and start enjoying life too short.  There's a new girl in town.  Here she goes.  Feeling good.  I've got a song.  Never, never knew.  Girl in town.  What was she thinking?  The end is even worse. 
[09:30]
 Listen to this.  Cover your dog's ears.  Here it comes.  Whee!  It's like the emergency broadcast test.  What do you have to do?  All right.  See?  That was one version.  Yes, and there's a total of three, you're saying.  Oh, yes, Opie.  Listen to this.  Do we have to hear another one?  I used to be shy.  See, this is more dead. 
[10:00]
 That's it.  That's it.  I never knew.  Kicking myself in nothing.  All right, enough of her.  You'd be sick.  All right, Linda Lavin.  Thank you.  Different version, though.  Thanks for that lovely phone call.  I'm not as equally as Hammy.  Never knew.  Girl in town.  Looking good.  What the hell is that?  I have no idea.  Get a singer for your show.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, Led Zeppelin, Traveling Riverside Blues. 
[10:30]
 Misty Mountain Hop before that from Zozo.  Some people like to call it Led Zeppelin 4.  I don't think the band actually named that album.  Some people picked up that it said Zozo on the side of the CD and said, it's called Zozo, man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  All right.  On the way, some two-fers from Alice in Chains.  Rock.  Our listeners were bitching and complaining, saying they don't hear enough Alice in Chains  on any W.  So we paid attention. 
[11:00]
 We listened to you.  We'll do a two-fer before the end of the hour.  Figured that.  And we got some Joe and Jed up next for you.  Got a fax here.  Opie and Anthony, just so you know, Linda Lavin, the Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, Led Zeppelin,  Linda Lavin is still on TV.  She plays the mother of the main character on NBC's bad new sitcom, Conrad Bloom.  What?  Like I said, she's not on TV anymore.  I swear to God, I've never heard of this sitcom.  Conrad Bloom?  Never heard of it.  And then Cathy goes on to say, she doesn't sing, though. 
[11:30]
 Thank God for small favors.  You guys are great.  Conrad Bloom.  Conrad Bloom.  I swear, I've never even heard the name.  All right.  We'll learn something today.  Well, if she is still on TV, she's not going to be for long.  I've never heard of that.  I don't know if anybody talking about that show.  It doesn't have a buzz to it.  No clue.  Oh, someone is on the line.  They just joined the club, Ant.  Oh, nice.  Hello.  Hello, Anthony.  Yes.  I am a new member of the Hummer Club. 
[12:00]
 All right.  I'm the Hummer and he is the Hummy.  When did it go down?  Three o'clock this afternoon.  Good job.  Right on the numbers.  Yeah.  First in for the week.  You are our first brand new member this week.  Why, thank you.  What's your name?  Mary.  Mary, what's his name?  Bob.  Bob.  Cool.  What were the details?  Oh, a little bath, a little shower, a little, you know.  Don't you guys have to work today? 
[12:30]
 Well, he worked nights and I was off, so it was perfect.  That rocks.  Are you guys waiting all day to 3 o'clock to hit so you can become members?  I could stand it, yeah.  That's awesome.  Tapping at the bit, so to speak.  All right on.  So, Middlesex County rocks on.  Cool.  I was calling from South River, New Jersey, and right now he's taking it easy.  He's probably napping.  Yeah, he is. 
[13:00]
 All right, I'm out on the cigarette.  God, look, I think we made you happy today.  I think so.  Oh, cool.  It's a definite deal.  Well, congratulations, guys.  Oh, radio.  Were you listening to the radio while I was going down?  Oh, that is so weird.  Oh, he's having on.  Yeah, that is a little bit loud.  Anthony and I are trying to figure out how many people are having sex while they listen  to us.  Oh, all the time.  Oh, it's awesome.  You got to have that spirit to rock hard.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNAW, two for Tuesday with Joan Jett. 
[13:30]
 Little drummer boy and Anthony, the complaints are coming in about that song.  Yeah.  We're not allowed to talk bad about the music anymore, but that's a Christmas song, so it's  kind of seasonal.  So maybe the song blows.  Just say that one of our favorites.  Are people like in their cars singing along and stuff, getting psyched for the holiday  because they just heard Joan Jett sing Little Drummer Boy?  Oh, yeah, not a fave. 
[14:00]
 Everyone's calling it bitch and they go play and saying, don't you guys have anything better  to play as far as holiday music?  I like the, I just like the goof Christmas songs.  I just don't get into like all these bands, you know, with their Christmas songs.  Well, you liked Gary Hewitt.  Yeah, because it was different though.  You know what I mean?  Because he was jamming and you're like, how the hell is this guy going to play the Grinch 
[14:30]
 Christmas song on a guitar and he pulled it off?  That's why I liked it.  It was totally different and new and exciting.  Doing the 12 days of Christmas on a guitar.  Try to figure that at home if you're a guitar player.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Yeah, you're right.  I did like that.  So people are requesting our Christmas songs.  Maybe we can play that here.  Yeah, that's a good goofy song.  I think it's better than the Little Drummer Boy by Joan Jett.  Definitely.  Now that makes me laugh.  If it puts me in the spirit to run around from mall to mall to try to get my Christmas 
[15:00]
 shopping done.  Really?  Not Joan Jett, Little Drummer Boy.  Please.  And your brother did a great job on that song.  Yes, yes he did.  Anthony's brother Joe on lead vocals for the Grandma song that you can find on Open Anthony's  Dementor World CD.  Good luck trying to find that this holiday season.  A lot of people calling in saying, hey, congratulations.  You finally figured out a bet last night.  Yes, I did.  You picked the Niners.  And they won.  I did.  I did.  I did. 
[15:30]
 And all fairness, not the hardest bet to make.  Oh right, since they will accept it.  And the Giants Denver thing was a hard one.  You're like, 49 is over the line.  It's not a hard bet.  No, I'm just saying the obvious.  A lot of people took the Niners and gave the points last night.  This is the same thing with the Giants.  I'm just busting your balls.  Damn.  You went on a limb and said that the Broncos would beat the Giants. 
[16:00]
 All right, so you're right.  Oops.  How's your Zoom.com doing today?  Well, I don't even want to talk about it.  Why?  Well, first of all, what did the market do today?  Did we kind of survive?  I know it was up a lot earlier in the day.  Yes, I think we muddled through today, OP.  But the market's just having a horrible couple of weeks.  Yes, I may have made a...  Oh, wow, it's way up.  Yeah, close to 127. 
[16:30]
 127 up?  27.  Okay.  Very good.  And I got rid of my Zoom.  It's all time low and it went up today.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's follow the story of Anthony and Zoom.com.  Oh, no.  Four days ago, you bought Zoom at how much?  At 38.  Zoom.com at 38.  Okay.  You sold it when?  Yesterday?  Yeah.  At what?  Like 21.  21?  You lost 17 points in what, three days? 
[17:00]
 Yeah, now it's going back up.  You're kidding, right?  What did Zoom.com close at today?  What did it close at?  It's like 23.  Oh, my God.  Around this.  And you sold it at 25.  No, that's the way to go though.  You buy high and sell low.  That's a great strategy you got there, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I should jump back on it. 
[17:30]
 You might as well.  You might as well.  You're going to jinx it, but give it a try.  So you bought it at 38, you sold it at 21, and today it's up to 23.  I better quit this game, huh?  I don't think I'm any good at this.  Well, the stock market might not be your cup of tea.  Not my cup of tea.  I'll go back to the track.  Let's stick with the Half-Life game that you play.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there we go.  1027 WNOW, the Rock of New York. 
[18:00]
 Two for Tuesday with Allison Chains for the Unplugged CD.  What a great CD that is.  Over now, and no excuses from Jar of Flies before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  And everyone is calling up about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Of course.  And we've got a bunch of guys standing by on hold.  They need our help today, Anthony.  Well, that's what we like to do on Tuesday.  We call up the significant other and give a helping hand, as they say.  Yes.  And let the girls know what the guy wants tactfully. 
[18:30]
 Of course.  And most of the time we're successful.  The last couple of weeks we haven't been quite as successful as we'd like to be.  Right.  I think a couple couples are heading toward divorce court because of the phone calls we  made the last couple of weeks.  But in general, we do get the deed accomplished for the guys.  And there's a bunch of people just calling in the middle of the act and stuff.  It's like, OK, we know you're becoming members while we're on the air.  Call us after it's done. 
[19:00]
 Yeah, we don't want to hear it during.  No, we don't want to hear it.  Well, it's, yeah, exactly.  OK, thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, hi.  Two for Tuesday with Pink Floyd on the Rock of New York, 1027WNAW.  You're taking the ride home with Opie and Anthony.  And new members are joining the Tuesday Night Homer Club as we speak.  A lot of you guys on the highway as you drive home, thanks for letting us know about that.  Just keep the car between the lines, OK?  Yeah.  And at this point, I guess it's time to try to help a couple out there.  Anthony, we like to do this every week. 
[19:30]
 We get in there and try to get the couple some action.  Yes.  It might have changed a little since you've been married.  And we like to get in there and shake things up again.  We get close to 100 people contacting us every week, begging us to talk to the wife or the  girlfriend or other guys, actually.  Guys begging us to talk to other guys for them. 
[20:00]
 This club is for everyone, I guess.  That's fascinating.  It's quite fascinating.  We've got to do that one of these days.  We'll do the guy-guy thing one of these days.  Oh, jeez.  Have fun.  We've got to.  It would be sick, but it would be funny to sit through that.  I think a lot of people would check it out just for the hell of it.  But yeah, you guys contacting us all week long with your sob stories.  You basically say that you just don't know how to bring it up anymore. 
[20:30]
 Yeah, it's very hard to just bring up in conversation.  A nice breaker.  That's what we're doing.  And a lot of the emails and letters and stuff start to say, when we first started dating,  there's always that line, things were great.  We had monkey sex on the subway.  We would do it on the couch while her parents were in the other room.  We went downstairs to do the laundry.  That's what they thought we were doing down there.  But then time passed.  I got two jobs and she's working and trying to raise the kids. 
[21:00]
 And now our mother-in-law lives with us.  All these just horror stories.  So that's why we started the Tuesday Night Hammer Club.  We figured we'd put it right out in the open for everyone.  All right, so let's talk to Stephen here and see if we can help him out.  Steve, I hear you need our help trying to get your wife into the Tuesday Night Hammer  Club thing.  Oh, most definitely.  She ain't buying it at all.  She's thinking of making the whole thing up.  And I put you guys on to have her listen to when you guys were already off last week.  Well, the key is to get her to listen to us while we're on the air. 
[21:30]
 Yeah, that's what that usually helps.  Well, where is she right now?  She should be home.  If she's not home, she's just out spending more of my money, which that ain't too good.  All right, when was the last time you had her home?  We're talking months.  Back in June, maybe.  Okay.  It's been a while.  And why don't you guys get it on?  Well, she was saying that she didn't like the way...  Well, can I say ****?  I guess I can say **** now, huh?  I should say she didn't like the way my **** thinks I was drinking beer.  So I quit drinking, you know?  And there's still nothing. 
[22:00]
 Yeah, I got the herbs still, but...  All right, all right.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, a little too much information there, Stephen.  All righty.  All right, let's give her a call here.  What's her name?  Roseanne.  All right, Stephen, let us do all the talking, but you'll be able to listen in, okay?  You got it.  All right, hold on.  Hello?  Roseanne?  Yes?  Hi, it's Opien Anthony from WNEW Radio.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Good.  Your husband told us to give you a call.  Oh, he did?  Yes. 
[22:30]
 Okay.  Do you know why he told us to give you a call?  I have not a clue.  You listen to the show at all?  When I can, yes, I do.  All right.  You know what Tuesday is?  Uh, no.  Why do you laugh when you say that?  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm supposed to know, I guess, right?  No, why do you laugh when you say that?  You have an idea.  No.  Yes, you do.  No, I really don't.  Maybe not.  Because Steve also said that he talked to you about it and you didn't believe him.  No, I didn't. 
[23:00]
 All right, well, we did start the club, the Tuesday Night Hammer Club.  Is this ringing a bell now?  Yeah, now it's ringing a bell.  All right.  And we're crazy enough to actually start this club.  Uh-huh.  It's just a way to get couples together, to break the ice.  Okay.  Yeah.  When was the last time you gave him a homework?  Excuse me?  Oh, Opie, you've got to be a little more tactful here.  All right, well, you try.  Let's just, okay.  So, how long you kids been married?  Almost four years.  And I heard a little toddler in the background.  Yes, you did. 
[23:30]
 So, when was the last time you hobbed his dog?  Oh, Opie, please, please accept my apology.  I don't even know what to say.  So, you have a child too, huh?  Yes, we do.  That should be a good clue.  Things might have changed since you first got married, right?  Yes.  Well, that happens with everybody.  Have you buffed his helmet lately?  I'm sorry, have I what?  Bring him right here, sweetheart.  See, this is the type of stuff that kind of gets in the way of your relationship being 
[24:00]
 the way it used to be.  And guys have a hard time asking for a certain thing that is very special to us.  The Hummer.  So we're saying that on Tuesdays, maybe the women in the relationship can give the men  a Hummer, thus breaking the ice and getting those wild, crazy sexual days back again.  Oh, okay.  That's not grandma. 
[24:30]
 Oh, no.  No, it's not grandma.  Definitely not grandma.  How can we possibly do that with a kid right there?  Really?  I'm not even that sick.  Is it great?  I'm not even that sick.  I'm not even that sick.  Well, Roseanne, what do you think the chances are of making Stephen a member tonight?  Oh, I think we could probably swing something.  All right.  It would make him very happy.  Okay, I'm glad.  We're trying to make the world a happier place and I think that's one way to start.  That's wonderful.  You guys are really something. 
[25:00]
 I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm so glad you're here.  Well, we try to be tactful but it just never works.  Well, listen, I just have one question for you.  What's in it for the women?  Anything?  Well, we do encourage reciprocation.  Oh, okay.  Whatever that means, whatever you're into.  I know pretty much every guy is into hummers and women, they're different. 
[25:30]
 Some are into whatever.  But if there's a guaranteed hummer in it, I'm sure the guy will go for anything.  Actually, Stephen.  Yeah?  Your husband's on the line, Rosanne.  I'm sure he is.  Hello, darling.  Hello, darling.  See, this is what it takes.  I tried to tell you this is real s***.  I didn't believe it.  Yeah, well, now you do.  You didn't believe it, huh?  No, I didn't.  Woo, hummer baby.  Well, there you go.  We accomplished a feat for you guys.  Beautiful deal, guys.  Well, have fun and let us know how it turns out tomorrow. 
[26:00]
 Most definitely.  All right, man.  Grandma!  No, it's not grandma!  One oh two seven WNEW, the Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday, Jimi Hendrix, Dolly Dagger.  I don't think I've ever played that song on the radio.  No?  Sounding good though, man.  We're doing different things here at NEW.  And are you experienced before that?  We're going to send that out to Brian and Gene and the rest of the gang at Centerport  Deli.  They've been with us from the beginning and we appreciate it, boys.  Thanks for checking in.  Yes. 
[26:30]
 Another Long Islander has joined the NEW staff, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  And now, our friend Ralph DeTour.  We're very excited to announce that he is now doing the shift right before us here at  NEW.  You were co-workers for a while, weren't you?  We were co-workers on Long Island for like three, three and a half years.  And I grew up cutting class in high school and tuning in Ralph as we're drinking our  beers in the parking lot of Harborfields High School.  So I go way back with Ralph DeTour.  And it's the first time I feel like the station is finally moving forward. 
[27:00]
 Here we go.  We're moving.  The process has begun.  We've got a new morning show coming in soon.  We'll have details on that and that's a very exciting thing as well.  Uh-huh.  So please keep listening to NEW.  It's only going to get better from here.  We don't do these things overnight.  No.  Slow, arduous process.  Overnight.  You know, it's our six-month anniversary today of doing afternoon drive in New York  City.  Are you kidding me?  Six months.  We've been here six months.  Feels like five years. 
[27:30]
 I know.  And Ralph DeTour takes you through the world's largest rock library with the online archives  weekdays at noon.  A new feature that he brought to NEW and it's pretty cool.  He's featuring great guitars this week.  So make sure you check out Ralph tomorrow at noon.  Okay?  Rock.  Anthony, I got another telemarketer call.  I forgot to tell you.  Which one is this?  This is a new one.  What do you got?  Well, um, I got a new one.  What do you got? 
[28:00]
 Well, um, as probably a lot of faithful listeners know by now, I'm sick of the telemarketers.  Yeah.  So I have turned the tide on them because they refuse to stop calling me.  I've tried all the tricks, you know, take my name off your list.  Nothing works.  Nothing.  So I tape them and I mess with them a bit.  All right.  This one, I will warn people ahead of time, is a bit harsh.  Like the other ones aren't?  Yeah.  A bit harsh, a bit edgy.  If you're going to be easily offended, you know, uh, turn over to, you know, Fat Rocky 
[28:30]
 and uh, you know, make a bid on a Furby dollar, whatever the stupid thing he's doing today.  Right.  Hey, we got Furbies.  What will you do for a Furby guy?  For a Furby.  Hey, we're going to, you have to try to tell us what the little Furby's saying to win the  Furby.  I know some stupid station in this, uh, in this town is doing that bit.  So of course I wouldn't doubt it if it was him.  But anyway.  So this lady calls from a bank, the bank I go to.  A bank?  Yes. 
[29:00]
 I don't think I've ever gotten a telemarketer call from a bank.  Well, they're calling their customers to see how the service is.  Oh, oh.  You know, one of those, uh, service surveys.  Right.  So they ask you a bunch of questions and between a scale of like one to 10, you got to rate  the service.  Okay.  Like how is the teller, where you're greeted, where you're, you know, taking care of with  everything you needed, all that crap.  I've heard of those.  Okay.  And you sit home and you rate them.  Well, this gets way out of hand.  Take a listen.  One Oh two seven WNAW, the Rock of New York, Rolling Stones, Two for Tuesday, Rockin' a 
[29:30]
 Hard Place and Love is Strong.  Those bastards aren't coming to New York, huh?  Hartford is the closest they're coming on their next tour.  Great.  No New York, huh?  Thanks for taking care of us, Mick.  You're only in this city every other weekend doing our broads.  You can't play for us.  It's not a, it's not a big city or anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, the cute little town of New York, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Great.  Why aren't they playing New York? 
[30:00]
 There's no basketball.  I'm sure they could get some dates at the garden.  Oh, that's a good question.  It's pathetic.  I guess we got to get them broads.  Broad.  Mixed broads.  Do we even use the term broads in the late nineties?  Uh, yes, I think that's the term now that we use.  Yes, broads.  So, Penanthi, I want to congratulate all the new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club,  everyone.  Good job.  Good job.  Good job, people.  Is Ben in it yet?  Um, I don't know. 
[30:30]
 We're going to talk to Ben.  Who the hell are you, first of all?  Yeah, really?  This guy's been like, sitting here for the last three hours.  We don't even know who you are.  Two and a half hours.  I'm Anthony from Vital Transportation.  I'm one of your sponsors.  Oh, crap.  Do you guys want me out of here right now?  We hate our sponsors.  It's like we're under a constant state of blackmail.  No, we love our sponsors.  Yes, we do.  And what do you do?  We have a limousine company in Manhattan.  I have 350 sedans and 100 limousines. 
[31:00]
 And Lisa Orban was nice enough to solicit me, and we're one of your sponsors now.  We start in the third week of January.  Hey, congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Wait, you have those cars that the guys drive around and cut everybody off with?  Oh, definitely.  The guy goes, I don't know where I'm going.  Where do I go?  He's on the air.  He has no idea.  Some of those drivers are worse than the cabbies.  Well, my guys are all right.  They're all right.  They don't smell.  How's that?  You don't have any of those livery cabs, do you?  No. 
[31:30]
 I hate the livery cabs.  They're all sedans.  They're all limousines.  I've got 350 sedans, 100 limousines.  In fact, we're going to send, I guess, a couple home.  Yes.  Your friends are yours, right?  From Boston, John.  Yeah, John and his lovely girlfriend, Ton.  I don't think she's from Boston, though.  No, she's from London.  You want to hear a little bit of that?  Yeah, listen to this great accent.  Come on, Tanya.  Say hi.  Hello.  Don't you love that?  Hey, what do you call pants?  Chalices.  Or?  No, that's rude. 
[32:00]
 No, say it.  Go ahead.  Nickers.  She thinks nickers is rude?  She thinks the word nickers is rude.  Are you serious?  Come on.  Rick said, you know, maybe on the way home that he can get into the Hummer Club tonight.  Never know.  I'll find out later and then we'll discuss it tomorrow.  All right.  So you got those big-ass limos that are like a block long.  How long are these limos going to get before they break in half?  I got a 14-passenger that sits there the size of a van. 
[32:30]
 It's got everything.  You got the soda machine, the sink, the toilets.  It's all around.  The soda machine.  It's a limo.  What the hell happened to the limo?  You got a hot tub in the middle.  I brought him a shirt.  I brought Anthony a shirt for Joe DiMaggio.  How am I supposed to wear this?  Where can I possibly?  Let me explain really fast.  He brought presents in for everyone. 
[33:00]
 He brought Ben, who was with that transsexual over the weekend.  I guess officially he didn't do much with the transsexual, so he says.  So what did you bring him?  I brought him an escort service book, you know, for S&M.  I figured if Ben wants to have some girl call up, hopefully she'll be a girl, not a man  and a mustache.  I told Ben, call up, see how much it's going to cost you.  We'll put it on the credit card and see if he can get satisfied for the evening.  All right, so you brought that for Ben.  For Anthony, you got him a t-shirt.  I brought it all.  Did you see what I brought it all?  I brought it all, a giant's yearbook and some rolling papers. 
[33:30]
 I got the Jolton Joe DiMaggio.  You got the Jolton Joe DiMaggio.  Everyday Anthony's sitting there saying, you know, this guy's dying.  Now he's walking.  Now he might be dying.  So I had him every day, a different condition.  One day is fair.  I think more tasteless than anything I said.  Okay.  But hang on, thanks.  And where's the Tuesday Night Homer shirt you got?  Tuesday Night Homer shirts are right here.  All right.  This is for you.  It's like Christmas in here. 
[34:00]
 Cute.  Can I say happy birthday to my son?  He's one year old today.  Security, security.  I'm going to kill Lisa.  I'm going to kill Lisa.  I can't wear this.  I can't wear this.  It's got sexual positions all over the back.  And it says on the front, if Wednesday is hump day, then Tuesday is hummer day.  I can't, where am I going to wear this, dude?  I, you know, you want to make your lawn.  There's all kinds of sexual positions on the back of the shirt. 
[34:30]
 Two, three, four, five, six, seven hummer positions on the back of the shirt.  Correct.  There you go.  Correct.  I don't know.  Oh, that's her hair.  I don't know.  I thought the guy had a horse tail on.  Yeah, but that's not her hair.  All right.  Wow.  Well, thanks.  Just like Christmas.  You're welcome.  Thank you guys for having me on.  Okay.  Thanks for letting me sit outside for a couple of hours.  I also brought you a free $50 feels for meals, travelers check for the first 50 people. 
[35:00]
 They get free feels.  Yeah.  Vital transportation is donating that to them.  Okay.  Yeah, we are trying to get the feels for meals thing together, but all right.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Thanks.  Thanks for having me guys.  Great.  I hope I didn't ruin the show.  No, you're fine.  No, no, we were ruined well before you came in today.

Welcome everyone to the Tuesday Night Armor Club.  A lot of new memberships were begun today.  Yes, yes. 
[37:00]
 One thing I'd just like to play.  What?  A little thing.  You have nothing.  A fun little holiday ditty.  You have nothing.  What are you getting at?  This is funny, I think.  What's funny?  It's you.  It's a tape of you.  Dude, you've been trying to play this tape for about a week now.  Well, what am I going to wait until Christmas is over?  It's a fun holiday little bit. 
[37:30]
 Here's Opie.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  Come on.  Come on. 
[38:00]
 Right.  My poor son.  Thank God he's only one.  Come on, man.  Play it.  This is the old me, though.  Come on.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is Opie from a few years back when he had some issues, I guess.  Well, this kid.  And he felt compelled to tell a small child that there was a...  No Santa Claus.  He just did it again.  No kiddies.  Of course there is a...  Santa will be bringing you gifts.  No, let me explain myself.  I said when I finally have kids someday, then I'm going to tell them right off the bat there's 
[38:30]
 no Santa because I want the credit.  I worked two jobs, worked my butt off.  I never understood that growing up that my parents sat there and kept their mouths shut  as we opened up just tons and tons of toys.  Right.  And they never got the credit.  I want the credit.  So he took it a step further and did this.  Well, no.  He was able to tell a small child.  So we're talking about Santa on the air and then a bunch of people called, freaking out 
[39:00]
 and really pissed because their kids were listening to the radio and I was the one that  broke the news to them.  Exactly.  And they didn't appreciate that.  Instead of saying, okay, well, thank you and hanging up.  Which I did in this call.  You'll hear that.  Oh yeah.  No, you begged the guy to put his kid on the phone.  You are going to wreck me.  I will not be able to leave my house.  It was all be from a while ago.  Come on.  It's funny.  Who cares?  And now this kid has grown up and he has a family of his own and he's okay. 
[39:30]
 What?  He's okay.  Wow.  Really?  Only in the two, three years that it's been?  No, this happened 22 years ago.  Oh, right.  Actually very old.  This is the old me and now I'm the new me and this kid is okay.  He's well adjusted.  Even though I said this to him.  Well, let's just throw this out there and the people can judge.  Yeah, I was just listening to your station a while ago.  Yeah.  And I had my three year old son with me and you guys were putting down Santa Claus, the  Santa Clause thing and all it's just your parents and all that. 
[40:00]
 And I was like, I love Opie and Anthony.  You know, I'm a faithful listener but I had to change the station.  That's okay.  You're doing parenting that's called when you change the station.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  I detect that you're a little pissed at us because we just said that there's no Santa  Claus on the air.  Well, it would be one thing if it was a little later at night and there wouldn't happen to  have been someone's kid listening, you know.  Dude, I just saved you the hassle.  Now you can get the credit for all those presents you bought for him. 
[40:30]
 Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't actually.  I changed the station in time where he didn't pick up on it because he was busy doing something  else.  Hey, what's your son's name?  It's Jeffrey.  Can I talk to him real fast?  Why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not going to say anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right.  Where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him.  He doesn't have to say to you.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus. 
[41:00]
 Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus at your dad.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Heartless.  Come on.  That can't be real.  Come on.  Great, huh?  God, that is funny.  You're a cruel man.  What?  May I?  May I?  Yeah.  No.  First of all, how come everyone you get on the phone is either going, no, or, oh, no. 
[41:30]
 Yeah, Bill's dead.  But I was too, oh, no.  No.  He was slicking away like the way he was slicking away.  Like the way he was slicking away.  Listen, man.  Poor kid.  The mother and father, you know, how stupid are they?  Pretty damn stupid.  I'll give you that.  Thank you.  They had to be really stupid and put you on the phone.  Thanks for wrecking my life, Ant.  Appreciate it.  That was great.  All right.  A little holiday call.  It's a little holiday cheer.  Yeah, cute.  Let's follow it up with, do they know it's Christmas now? 
[42:00]
 Oh.  He's sitting on the couch right now.  Daddy, is there really not a Santa Claus?  This is about you.  Anthony, Pepsi One.  Opi?  Yes.  I am proud that the fine people at Pepsi decided to advertise on the Opi and Anthony show.  Okay.  Are they crazy?  They got a brand new product, Pepsi One.  And we tried it yesterday for the first time.  Pepsi One, I hate diet soda.  I was raised with my mother always having diet soda in the refrigerator. 
[42:30]
 And it was terrible.  I'd go to my friend's house and get real soda because it tasted better.  You can just tell when it was diet.  Yeah.  So when I get this Pepsi One yesterday, I'm like, oh, another one.  Okay, bring it on.  I've had the Nutrisweet.  I've had everything else.  Bring it on because this has a new sweetener.  So I drink it now.  All right.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's pretty good.  It wasn't bad.  And it was.  And I'm the biggest critic because I hate diet soda.  So if you want those big fat women that eat like crazy, they get, well, you ever see it? 
[43:00]
 They get all the food and then they get the diet drink.  Yes.  Get the Pepsi One because at least it'll taste good.  I'll go one step further.  I didn't even know it was a diet cola.  Yeah, no clue.  I just started drinking it because I was choking on my lunch.  I go, all right, let me try this Pepsi One.  Yeah.  And I honestly just thought it was a brand new sweetener.  I didn't realize it was a diet product.  And I was happy with it.  Seriously, if you've got to drop weight or you don't have to, if you just want something 
[43:30]
 that tastes good, I'd recommend this.  Collette, say Ralph Titora one more time.  Ralph Titora.  Now she's trying to say it right.  Where's this chick from?  Where are you from, Collette?  France.  France.  It's very obvious.  And she just found out that Ralph Titora, who used to work on Long Island, is now working  here at N.E.W. doing the shift before us.  And we didn't understand she was talking about him because she said, I do have Ralph Titora.  I was like, I don't know, it sounds like a disease the way you say it. 
[44:00]
 Now, Collette, say his name again.  Okay, Ralph, talk to her now.  All right.  Are you going to call him tomorrow and welcome him aboard?  Oh, yay.  Yeah, a lot of the Long Islanders are very psyched that Ralph is now here at N.E.W.  So check him out.  Look how excited he is.  Monday through Friday from 12 to 3.  It's a literal meaning of French dip.  I've gotten those at the diner occasionally.  Now we have one on the phone.  That's a nice Christmas gift.  Oh, really? 
[44:30]
 Yeah.  You want to do them or something?  I mean, why are you that excited?  Oh, you kidding?  Oh, you kidding?  All right.  I'll stick to you.  All right, Frenchie.  Bye.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Call Ralphie tomorrow.  Okay.  What did she say again?  Ralph Titora.  Ralph Titora.  All right, later.  Bye.  Let's get this over with.  Okay.  All right, later.  Bye.  Let's get the hell out of here, Anthony.  I'm gone. </pre>
