<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a graphic comparison of watching Gordon Ramsay cook to a sexual encounter, immediately setting the tone for the broadcast. This segued into a discussion of Opie's Valentine's Day dinner at Ramsay's restaurant, arranged by Don Wicklund,  which included Opie's wife, Ronnie B and his wife from the Ron and Fez show, and Opie's fiancée.  Opie repeatedly complained about the heat and length of the meal, oblivious to the prestige of the experience, prompting much discussion and a caller's betting offer on the veracity of his account. This segment also included a tangent about Jane Fonda's profanity on the *Today Show* and a double standard regarding acceptable language.  Bobby Kelly was in studio throughout this portion, and the show promoted upcoming guests: Michael Emerson (*Lost*), and Big A (with audio from the Playboy Mansion), along with their iTunes animation. Profanity and sexually suggestive topics were frequent throughout.

Next, a segment called "A Bronx-ish Tale" featured Rich Voss's disastrous attempt to perform a scene from *A Bronx Tale*, with the unexpected appearance of Chaz Palminteri in studio providing a stark contrast to Voss's nervous and awful performance.  Audio clips highlighted Voss’s comedically bad reading.

Following this, Big A recounted his experience at the Playboy Mansion for the *Knight Rider* premiere party.  Awkward audio clips of Big A interviewing celebrities (including Bruce Davidson) showcased his difficulty formulating questions and the celebrities' visible discomfort.  Further audio captured his interactions with American Gladiators and Hugh Hefner, all marked by nervousness, awkwardness, and inappropriate or rambling questions.  The segment included numerous F.U. calls from listeners.

The show then hosted Michael Emerson (*Lost*) in studio. The hosts and Emerson discussed *Lost*, fan theories, the writers' strike, and the challenges of portraying Ben.  Emerson detailed filming on Oahu and the use of special effects to simulate snow.  The segment concluded with a comically offbeat Black History Month tribute to Peter Edmund (*Full Metal Jacket*).

A later segment revisited the *Lost* discussion, focusing on the show's structure and mysteries, particularly the smoke monster, Ben’s goals, and Richard Alpert. This transitioned into a critique of Anthony's overly enthusiastic interviewing style, using examples from interviews with Shawnee Smith and Michael Emerson, playing a chaotic Ed Asner interview. Opie's lack of enthusiasm for the Gordon Ramsay dinner was again referenced. The segment ended with promotional announcements for Bob Kelly's stand-up and Opie's Comedy Central special.

Another segment focused on the details of Opie and Ron's Valentine's Day dinner, mysteriously paid for by Don Wicklund.  Speculation regarding Wicklund's motives in relation to a potential merger were raised. The conversation included tangents on Opie's reluctance to socialize, Fez's absence due to "Sundowner's disease," Opie's wine snobbery, Anthony's Call of Duty Valentine's Day, Earl stories (including a "Top This" segment), strategies for getting days off, and finally, the arrival of Michael Madsen in studio.

The conversation with Michael Madsen was unscripted, ranging from his Hollywood experiences and negative interactions with colleagues to his self-reviews of his filmography on his website. Madsen recounted burning down a church, stories from his work with Sam Peckinpah and Quentin Tarantino (including the *Reservoir Dogs* ear-cutting scene), receiving Steve McQueen's shotgun, and graphic details from his new movie, *Boarding Gate*, including the use of a tomato as a prop. He also shared anecdotes from his past as a gas station attendant, his juvenile delinquency, and the sale of his *Reservoir Dogs* Cadillac on eBay.

The show concluded with a guessing game about the cost of a recent dinner with Madsen,  discussion of Big A’s creepy song, anecdotes about Opie's family and Anthony being kicked out of a casino, and promotion of *Boarding Gate*.  Bob Kelly's presence in the studio was noted throughout the show. The entire broadcast was characterized by a highly informal tone, frequent expletives, and numerous digressions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  A girl gives you a strip club advice, and then you go and see Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  Your girlfriend did. It was you.  Is this where entertainment is going?  I think if you were touched inappropriately, it would make it like a quick pop song.  Yeah.  Like the Beatles used to do. 
[00:01:00]  The love, love, me, don't.  Yeah.  They're like, shit, freeze!  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed himself.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  There it is.  What happened?  Doesn't it seem like it was just that crappy Monday?  What happened?  Yeah, Friday's here.  Pitching about it being Monday?  And now look, Friday.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  It just kind of rolls upon you.  Yes.  You wake up feeling all good going, oh, Friday.  I like it.  I want to thank Don Wicklund.  No, you don't. 
[00:02:00]  Because I'm going to be tired all morning long.  Uh-oh.  A little romance in the air?  Yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up, you.  Yeah, between the two of you, that would be a one-sided.  Now, he just wants me to like him so bad.  Well, any man.  Oh, Don wants any man to like him?  Yeah, yeah.  So that whole marriage thing is a clever rouge?  Uh, it's a farce. 
[00:02:30]  A little farce?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone knows Don, you know.  Well, he swings both ways, boys and men.  It was Valentine's Day yesterday.  It's going to kill me.  It's never going to turn on another radio for me.  Don, could you please activate my radio?  He'll do anything for us.  He'll do anything for us.  He really wants us to like him.  Uh, yeah, literally.  He would do that too, probably, if you really want to give it a shot.  But, uh, yeah, Valentine's Day. 
[00:03:00]  Also, I start getting emails a couple days out from Don.  He's like, you want to go out with me and my wife for Valentine's Day?  And I'm thinking to myself, Valentine's Day, aren't you supposed to just do that with  your, your sweetheart?  I don't think it's supposed to.  It's usually a one-on-one thing, yeah.  I don't think, uh, you're supposed to share Valentine's Day with another couple unless,  unless you're one of those swinging couples, I guess.  I don't know. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know what the hell that's about.  A swinger.  So I'm blowing off his emails.  I'm like, ugh.  I don't want to, I don't really like you.  I don't really hang out with you.  So why would I spend Valentine's Day with you and your wife?  He knows it's true.  Okay, then it's painless.  Oh, yeah, because during the dinner that I finally decided to do with Don Wicklund and  his wife and Ronnie B, which is key to the story, and his wife, uh, you know, it came  up after he was drinking a little bit.  I'm like, I just don't feel like returning phone calls and stuff. 
[00:04:00]  But anyway.  Oh, no.  How awkward.  So I've blown him off.  Wow.  And then all of a sudden, he really wanted us to go to freaking dinner with him.  So he finally goes, what if I invite Ronnie B and his wife as well?  Of course, Ronnie B from the Ron and Fez show.  Now I got, now I'm a little interested in this whole thing.  He goes, trust me, where I'm going to bring you, you could check it off your list.  Like, I guess he's into this whole bucket list thing because of the movie.  You could check it off your list. 
[00:04:30]  Something you did in your life.  I'm like, yuck.  Oh, God.  So to make a long story short, I went out to dinner with him, his wife, Ronnie B and  his wife, and, uh, and my lovely fiance.  And, uh, he takes us, he didn't, he didn't really want to tell us what it was all about,  but he goes, trust me on this one.  So we go to this, uh, really, really, really nice hotel.  We go through this ridiculously nice lobby and we enter what is obviously a five-star restaurant.  I'm like, wow. 
[00:05:00]  And then, uh, we're just having a drink at the bar and all of a sudden the lady comes  up to us and goes, your table is ready.  I'm like, cool.  Where are we going to sit in this awesome restaurant?  Next thing you know, we're going through private doors to some kind of VIP section where the  tables are, are spaced out much nicer than a regular restaurant.  You're not on top of somebody like you got room, man.  You can pretty much shout and the next table is not going to hear you.  Right?  And I'm like, wow, this is kind of cool.  Don, Don's got some, uh, you know, some pull, some juice. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Next thing you know, we go juice.  Next thing.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, we're going through another set of doors.  What the hell is this?  And now we're going through hallways and stuff.  I'm like, wow, man, this must be the, the super VIP table for the opening to get smart.  Right.  And then we went into a phone booth.  Yeah.  And, uh, another set of doors opens and now we're in the kitchen.  Like, all right, we got to walk through the kitchen to get to the special section. 
[00:06:00]  What was he making believe he was Henry Hill?  Right.  Handing people money on the way.  Trying to impress.  And then all of a sudden we turn the corner and we have a bird's eye view.  I mean, we're right there as the main chef is cooking, cooking for this five-star restaurant.  And I turn and I see a booth set up.  He got us a table in the kitchen of a five-star restaurant.  Is it?  Yeah.  Isn't that something like that's supposed to be a big to do? 
[00:06:30]  Uh, I guess.  What is it called?  I guess if you feel like eating dinner in a, in a, in a sauna.  Yeah.  Cause it's hot in the kitchen.  Holy.  And he makes us wear like suits and stuff.  I haven't had a suit jacket on since, uh, I believe it's the David Letterman show.  So it's been a while, a little over a year.  Yeah.  So I'm all dressed up and, and also we're in this really nice booth for six of us and  none of us are facing each other.  We're all facing the kitchen. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, cause you want to see him work.  I guess.  And, uh, Bob Kelly knows exactly what this is about.  I don't know.  I don't have any of this class in me.  It's the, uh, cause I watch, uh, as you well know, a lot of the food network and the travel  channel and TLC and other bite marks on your TV screen.  You're trying to just get at it.  Half a remote.  Yeah.  It's the chef's table.  That's what they call it.  The chef's table.  I guess it was a big thing to get the chef's table. 
[00:07:30]  And it was some guy named Ramsey or something.  I don't know.  I don't know who this Ramsey guy is.  Was it Ramsey?  Yeah.  No, it wasn't.  I swear to God.  No, it wasn't.  Gordon Ramsey.  Yeah, I guess.  You're kidding me.  So I don't know.  I don't know who Don, you know what to get this.  No, no, no.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's not, not chef Ramsey.  It really wasn't Gordon Ramsey.  You're lying.  Yeah.  Who's, I don't know who he is.  Who is he?  The Scottish guy with the blonde hair?  Yeah.  He's kind of, he's kind of an, like an ass.  Yeah, I guess.  I saw him.  Are you kidding me?  What?  I don't know this stuff.  That's pretty huge.  That's pretty, dude.  It's like the number one.  That's the guy from Hell's Kitchen. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.  He flips out on people.  Right.  He'll go into a crappy restaurant and, and, and, and.  This tastes like dog food.  Yeah.  It's bollocks.  Yeah.  Do it again.  Throw it out.  It's trash.  You, and then he curses at people.  So what is he, like a, what, is he a reviewer or something for the New York Times?  Reviewer?  No, dude.  He is like a, he is the number one chef.  Really?  He has that, like, it's not even five stars.  It's like, like the Magnolia Medallion Award. 
[00:08:30]  What is it called?  I don't know.  So when I was bitching, I should have been more appreciative because I was sweating my ass  off.  I'm like, I don't, why can't we have a table in there where it's nice, the perfect temperature?  Dude, the guy is probably the most recognizable chef, aside from, like, Wolfgang Puck.  He has two hit shows on television.  Really?  Yeah, dude.  Really?  Yeah, dude.  He has two huge hit shows.  Hell's Kitchen.  Oh, that guy. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I saw him.  Is that the guy?  Turn that monitor on there, Eroch.  I just thought he was the waiter.  I don't know.  I thought he was the waiter.  I thought that guy was the waiter.  That's Gordon Ramsay.  He wasn't dressed like that.  He was dressed like he was a, you know, Jesus, I don't know.  It didn't kill you off.  Yes.  What?  Let me just serve this table.  Why?  There's no pumpkin in my risotto.  Right.  Can you get out of the way?  One spaghetti, one risotto.  Yes.  Yes.  Are you always going to be that rude and interrupt when I'm trying to talk?  I just want more pumpkin.  That's all I want.  Right.  Well, I'll get you more pumpkin. 
[00:09:30]  I'll ram it right up your ****.  Do you like it whole or diced?  Can we get security and get **** back to the seat, please?  So, that was the guy?  Yeah.  Dude, what?  How do you just not?  What happened?  Dude, that's probably the hardest chef's table.  Oh, my God.  The chef's table.  Chef's table is hard to get.  What is a chef's table?  Chef's table is when you get to.  A table in the middle of a freaking kitchen is an honor? 
[00:10:00]  Tell me why.  Dude, he is the number one chef of all time.  That's not just chef's table.  That's like you're dining and there's a celebrity in the room.  Yeah.  Well, but it was Don Wicklund.  How would he get this?  So, I just figured, wow, obviously, obviously the restaurant was booked for Valentine's Day  and this is all they got available.  Yeah, and on Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  I didn't even think of that.  Wow.  And then, I don't know, there was like 10 courses of little things, like little tiny 
[00:10:30]  little bite-sized things, but there were 10 of them, 10 courses, I guess.  Yeah, was it good?  It got to a point where they had an appetizer dessert before the dessert came out, and then  after the dessert, they had a chocolate thing to make sure you're okay with your dessert.  Chef's table, it's considered an honor to watch him and his staff work and prepare  your food.  It's reserved for the elite.  Oh.  Well, I had nothing to do with this.  Maybe Stupid Don threw me and Ronnie's name around to get this. 
[00:11:00]  Stupid Don.  Because Stupid Don went to like cooking school and stuff.  He wanted to be one of these guys.  Oh, did he?  So, he was.  Did he wash out?  Well, now I know why he was so excited the whole time, and then at one point, they go,  who wants to cook?  I'm like, I don't want to cook.  You got the opportunity to cook with Gordon Ramsay?  He wasn't dressed as like the chef.  He was kind of like just looking nice in the corner or whatever.  Yeah, because he's a celebrity.  And then all of a sudden, Don and his wife get up, and they're cooking.  I'm like, yeah, whatever.  I'll take a couple pictures for you. 
[00:11:30]  Did you cook?  No, I didn't cook.  Why would I cook?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  You could have taken some pictures.  And then Ronnie from Rana Fez, we were a little suspicious.  We're thinking, okay, now we're going to have to return the favor.  We're thinking that microphones are coming out at any moment, and now we have to do a private  radio show for these clowns.  So it's not smart that I actually said, could you cook this a little longer?  You didn't.  Oh, no.  You didn't do that.  You didn't do that.  This is not cooked, yes?  This is fine, mate. 
[00:12:00]  This is where it's supposed to be.  I don't understand.  What the hell is going on?  All right, hold on.  Let me say hi to Darren in Jersey.  Darren, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  How's it going?  Good, man.  I hope he's kind of stupid.  I would cut off my left nut to cook with Gordon Ramsay.  Really?  Why?  Because the guy's like a legend in the industry, man.  Yeah, he's a legend.  Famous hit shows.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean.  Dude, by the end of this thing, I almost passed out. 
[00:12:30]  I was soaked.  It was so hot in this kitchen.  Yeah, that's the kitchen.  It really is.  It's a crappy idea.  It's hot as hell.  Just the clanging would drive me nuts.  Yeah.  Someone mixing a sauce.  Oh, I'm not going to.  I mean, they were extremely professional, I guess.  I guess.  They would have.  You think any schlub is going to work with Gordon Ramsay?  You see what he does to these people?  It's not like you were at Mikey's Steakhouse in Long Island in the chef's kitchen.  I was making a lot of ratatouille jokes. 
[00:13:00]  Ratatouille.  Ratatouille.  Ratatouille.  You were a ratatouille.  I was like, I was saying stuff like, let's look for rats and, you know, fun stuff like  that.  Oh, God.  What?  Oh, God.  Dude, he doesn't take, do you ever see, he flips out on everybody.  Right.  Snaps.  That would have been great to see him.  Well, I know those cooking shows.  I've never, I've heard of the cooking shows.  I've never seen them.  Well, you did last night.  Live.  All right.  All right. 
[00:13:30]  I know they were like just.  I know.  He just doesn't get it.  All the food that came out looked really pretty and stuff, but I was, even though we  had 10 courses, I was a little hungry by the time we left.  You were still hungry?  And my cholesterol went up about two to three hundred points.  Well, I'm sure.  Very rich.  Yes.  That's where the people sitting at the table.  Can you cook this a little more?  Speaking of this, what, Kitchen Nightmares?  Kitchen Nightmares.  I think that's the show that's interested in doing something with my brother's restaurant 
[00:14:00]  in Huntington.  I wouldn't.  I swear to God.  I would not allow it.  Really?  Well, no.  Well, my brother, you know, the owner of FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart  of Huntington Village.  He'll be there this weekend off and on.  He got discovered by a headhunter for that show.  Don't do it.  Really?  He's not sure what to do.  Do not do it.  Because they basically go in and they set it up that this restaurant is on its last legs.  Right.  It's going to go under.  He's $600,000 in debt. 
[00:14:30]  He can only survive for 28 more days.  Oh, right.  And then he goes, Gordon comes in on his motorcycle with a leather jacket like a superhero, goes  into the kitchen, rubs his finger under the grill and shows him all the crap and the  cockroaches and how disgusting it is.  And then some hamburger your brother bought off the internet because it was a little cheaper.  And they expose all that.  And then he saves the day.  First of all, your brother would probably punch him in the face halfway through.  Well, my brother is more of an ass than I am.  Well, not an ass. 
[00:15:00]  I mean, he's a nicer person than me, actually.  But he doesn't.  I don't like being told what to do.  My brother definitely doesn't like being told what to do.  Oh, well, yeah.  Gordon Ramsay never tells people what to do.  No, never.  Why am I saying don't do this?  What am I, an idiot?  They were already at the restaurant and they filmed like an employee's meeting and their eyes  lit up.  They're like, wow, we want you and your restaurant for this show.  But my brother's not sure if he wants to do it.  But, oh, dude, if they went, wow.  Supposedly, though, these restaurants that are on the show, like there's a whole group  of people that just follow and check out these restaurants that he comes in and redoes. 
[00:15:30]  So, I don't know.  I don't know what he's going to do.  I haven't heard him talk about it in a while.  So, he might have even passed by now.  Let's say hi to Dave in Denver.  Dave.  Opie, you're an elitist ass.  Is there anybody on this planet you don't think you're better than?  Where did that come from?  The guy's sitting there.  Look, I got issues, but I swear to God, I don't know.  I don't know what a chef's table is. 
[00:16:00]  All I know is I was getting really hot.  I had to take my jacket off.  My shirt was unbuttoned.  I'm sweating.  So, he's got this whole thing wrong.  It's not like I'm looking at him like, yeah, whatever, dude.  I didn't know what this meant.  I was like, wow.  Opie appreciated the gravity of the event.  No, that's, you know, I just didn't know.  He thought it was an insult.  Yeah.  You couldn't get me a better table?  Dude, I mean, the kitchen?  People don't want to sit by the kitchen.  Not in the kitchen.  The rest of the restaurant had nice soft lighting. 
[00:16:30]  Of course it did.  Gordon Ramsay's cooking in it.  The tables were all spaced out nice.  I'm thinking, well, I guess this is the best we could do on Valentine's Day.  I guess, you know, you know, of course we ate for, we got there at six and I finally  got home and it's only like a 10 minute cab ride at 1030.  Four hours.  I'm like, enough with the courses. 
[00:17:00]  But that's the whole thing.  Oh my God.  It'd be the same guy at the Super Bowl.  All right, enough of meeting the players after they won.  You shake one hand in the locker room and get pictures.  You shake them all.  Just get me out of here.  Why do I have to take a knee and say a prayer with the team?  No, there's things I'd be excited about.  This is not one of them.  The food was really good.  And I guess I sort of halfway through understood that this was, I guess, something that's cool 
[00:17:30]  to check out.  Cool to check out.  Cool to check out is like a strip club where they get fully naked and they do ping pong  tricks.  How many people eat dinner in New York City on a nightly basis and how many actually get  the opportunity to eat at the chef's table when Gordon Ramsay's cooking and would absolutely  know who he is and appreciate it.  And then there's you.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Well, it's Valentine's Day, too.  On Valentine's Day, too.  Which is ridiculous.  Any girl would be like, oh my God, this guy takes me to the chef's kitchen.  It's Gordon Ramsay cooking.  That is an instant, like, month-long, every second you're going to be getting favors.  My girl would have cried.  I'm not even kidding.  She would have got emotional and cried.  You would have cried.  We all know you're a wuss.  I wouldn't have cried when I met him.  I would have cried when he said 10 meals.  Oh, thank you. 
[00:18:30]  I know that they brought out these little candy things that look like gems that we didn't  eat them.  We were too scared to eat them.  They look too pretty.  They look too nice to eat.  The food looked too nice.  No, these chocolate things.  They look like they just dug them from a mine somewhere.  Let's say hi to Prince.  Blood candy.  Prince in South Carolina.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing today?  Good, man.  I just want to tell you, what you experienced yesterday is pretty much like the equivalent  of an average person getting an invite to watch Michael Jordan Sweat playing basketball. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, that would have been cool.  I definitely would have enjoyed that.  That one I would have liked.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Tony in Pennsylvania.  Tony.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey.  Do you realize what an ass you are?  Yeah, I kind of, I guess I'm figuring it out now.  Hold on.  He's just like, what are you inviting me to go see a movie?  And you actually go to the set and sit next to Scorsese. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, there you go.  That's another thing.  What?  You go to a movie.  Scorsese and Scorsese is sitting there telling you about his film.  He's doing a director's commentary live next to you.  And then Opie goes, can you just keep it down?  And the guy, this guy was talking next to me.  This little short guy.  I don't know.  He's some Italian guy.  He had asthma.  He kept taking his asthma sprites.  He wouldn't shut up.  But he didn't know a lot about the movie and how it was made.  Oh, that was Scorsese. 
[00:20:00]  Who?  What?  I didn't agree with him, though.  I thought it was a totally different story.  Let's say hi to Kent, the movie guy.  Kent?  Hey, yeah.  Gordon Ramsay just kind of won his third Michelin star,  which is pretty much the biggest thing you can get as a restaurant owner.  Yeah.  Most people kind of get, like, two.  And that guy from that other show on Bravo, he just kind of lost one.  So this guy's like the Lance Armstrong of restaurants.  Like, nobody has done this before. 
[00:20:30]  There's one testicle.  What channel is the cooking show on?  I mean, I've heard of it.  The cooking show.  It's not even the cooking show.  It's the network.  Yeah.  Julia Child.  He has an uncensored show on the BBC you guys should pull audio from.  Yeah, yeah.  He curses like a maniac.  Smacks people, punches him in the face if he doesn't like what they're doing.  People have a real problem with this.  Joe and Rocklin, what's up?  What's going on, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, do you realize the opportunity you passed up?  That was like Steinbrenner making an invitation for you to meet up with Derek Jeter at Yankee Stadium and play catch. 
[00:21:00]  Just play catch with Jeter.  Unbelievable.  I can't believe it.  You dropped the ball, buddy.  I experienced.  Let's say hi to Randy, New Jersey.  Randy, what's up?  Oh, you guys should have been along great.  You're both complete assholes.  Yeah, you probably would have gotten along with him very well. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Everyone's all right.  Ryan in Virginia.  Hey, Opie.  I just don't believe you, man.  It's all right.  There's no way that six of you sat there in front of Gordon Ramsey.  Not one person mentioned the show or how famous he was.  Nothing like that.  No, no, no, no, no.  He wasn't cooking for us.  He was just kind of over there.  And Don goes, that's Gordon or whatever.  I think he said Gordon Ramsey, I guess. 
[00:22:00]  And I said, oh, wow.  Why are we sweating?  I'm calling from very near Langley, Virginia.  So I think I'm going to take this tape over to a little lie detector analysis.  All right.  You can do that, sir.  All right.  Watch out.  All right.  Thank you.  What an ass.  I mean, even if he is lying a little bit, it's called humor.  You exaggerate the truth a little.  This guy wants to stop the show.  No, you know what, though?  I absolutely believe Opie was just like, what?  Absolutely. 
[00:22:30]  I'm hot in here.  What is it?  Absolutely.  He doesn't even know his own friends when he's out to dinner with me.  What's your name again?  Oh, Bob.  Yeah, what's up, Bob?  How are you?  Hey, Bob.  Is your wife your girlfriend?  What is that?  The guy that hurt his leg once?  And Don, for the people that don't know, he really, really wants me to like him and stuff.  He calls a lot, and I just don't answer his phone calls and stuff.  And he's our liaison with XM down in Washington.  And he had this look in his eyes like, maybe finally.  Well, that was a biggie. 
[00:23:00]  That should have impressed anyone else.  Really?  Yeah.  It's as close as to sitting with the president of food.  I don't get it.  I don't even get that you haven't seen his face at all.  It was kind of weird when every course came out, like a different chef came up to us and  was explaining what we were eating.  That's what they do, because they're the ones that prepare the different courses.  I was like, enough.  I just want to eat.  What did you want?  Fries?  Yeah.  Do you want a Caesar salad? 
[00:23:30]  I'm like, all right.  I get it.  The food's good, and it looks pretty.  I hope he gets mad when all the food isn't on one plate.  Yeah.  I had something the other night at the Olive Garden.  Could you prepare it just like that?  Some kind of pasta thing.  All right there, Than.  You see Than in a panic.  Doesn't want to get into yesterday's situation.  His lips get smaller.  Yesterday's situation?  What happened?  Oh, with being late.  A little late for the break.  Wait, you got in trouble for that?  No, no. 
[00:24:00]  It was just we kind of got behind a little bit.  All right.  Well, the phone's just lit.  They just all want to yell at me.  So that was my Valentine's Day.  Why wouldn't they?  So that's a good one, huh?  That makes me mad.  Really?  Yeah, it really kind of makes me angry, because I watch all three of his shows, the BBC, one  of the two on American TV, and he is one of the most charismatic, just angry asses, but  he does have like the Michelin stars.  Unbelievable.  I'd love, I would love to be able to just go to his restaurant.  I'm actually too nervous to go there, because I think, you know, I'd feel uncomfortable. 
[00:24:30]  That would impress.  Like, I don't think you understand how much that would impress a girl to eat at the chef's  table with Gordon Ramsay there.  I hope he could get Billy Joel to sing his girl a love song on her birthday in their living  room, and the phone would ring, and he'd answer it.  Bill, Bill, hang on one second, one second.  Hold on.  And, Norton, let me call you right back, all right?  So I shouldn't be mad at Don, because here's the other thing.  I don't stay out late on school nights for the most part. 
[00:25:00]  I just can't get up and do the show if I'm out late.  So I'm like, oh my God, when is dessert going to get here?  It's freaking 9.30.  I'm in bed usually by now.  Oh, my God.  And then I woke up at 4.15 like I usually do, and I'm kind of yelling and screaming and  bitching out Don for making me not get a good night's sleep.  You are ridiculous.  It really is.  There's just something wrong with you.  You need a disease in your life so you can actually take it more seriously. 
[00:25:30]  Start appreciating things like that.  You really do.  You need to find a tumor.  He kept saying it was a big deal, so all right.  Big deal.  He kept saying, you know, you can check this one off your list, whatever that is.  All right.  So there you go.  I met Gordon.  I'm with Opie.  No big deal.  I agree with Opie.  Who cares about Gordon?  Gordon should be honored to cook for Opie and Ron.  Oh, wow.  Ron and Fez show.  All right.  We have to take our first break. 
[00:26:00]  Bobby's in today for Jimmy, who's out there in San Francisco.  Bobby Kelly.  A very busy show.  Call and yell at Opie at 877-212-0&A.  That's the FU line.  Oh, that's not the FU line?  Oh, okay.  Well, they're already calling, Iraq.  And like I said, I'm a little tired.  See, I didn't even recognize the number.  I say every freaking morning, thanks, Don.  Michael Emerson stopping by today from Lost. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  Ben from Lost.  What an episode last night.  Really?  I heard.  You haven't seen it?  Unfortunately, with Michael coming in, I had to know what happened.  So, I got a very detailed synopsis from Than and Travis.  I'm going to watch it, obviously, but the little surprises and stuff in there.  Oh, my God.  So, you didn't watch Lost last night?  No.  Damn it. 
[00:27:00]  You were doing your own Valentine's Day thing.  Well, I was kind of playing Call of Duty and mixed up in things.  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm an idiot.  I forgot.  That's because stupid Roland last week gave me an advanced copy.  He gave me a copy on Wednesday, and I watched it, and then I was expecting to get one, like,  yesterday, and I didn't, and...  Well, it's your fault, then.  I know, but...  Well, I know exactly what happened, and amazing episode, yes.  I must agree. 
[00:27:30]  I watched it like a blind person.  Can you believe that they actually had a T-Rex on the island?  Shut up.  I did not.  Is this Lost show a popular one?  Yeah, exactly.  This show got legs?  He could be on the island, and he'd be like, ah, I just...  Yeah, why?  So, Wickland took me to Hawaii, and they were filming some show.  I don't know what it was called.  Can't Be Found?  Something like that.  And...  Can't Be Found?  I met the cast. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know.  It was kind of cool.  I remember one guy from Party of Five.  I get it.  I guess yesterday was a big deal.  A big deal.  Also, Big A coming in.  He was at the Playboy Mansion with her own Sam, and we got great audio.  Big A attempting to interview celebrities, including Hugh Hefner himself.  So, the audio's terrific.  That I gotta hear.  That is terrific.  What a ghoul.  And then we gotta talk about Jane Fonda next.  We'll do that. 
[00:28:30]  Dropping the C-bomb.  No kidding.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And Bobby Kelly.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Bobby Kelly in-house today.  Before we move on, E-Rock found some info for me.  Yeah, I guess it was a restaurant called Gordon Ramsay at the London.  I was there last night for Valentine's Day, sitting at the chef's table, which I thought  was ridiculous, because you shouldn't, like, share Valentine's Day with other couples. 
[00:29:00]  I think it's a one-on-one thing, personally.  Well.  Except when you get a first, you know, a first-class seat to the moon.  Someone said it's like, it's like going around with Santa on Christmas and helping them,  like, give toys to the children.  I guess.  Code, alright.  Right.  Here's that, Gordon.  Try the wine.  All kidding aside, this is my problem in life. 
[00:29:30]  I need to enjoy things better.  I couldn't even really officially enjoy that, because I'm looking at the clock.  I'm like, I've got to get up at 4.15.  I mean, hurry up with this thing.  I've got to get to sleep.  There's like, he's bringing out, I don't know, eight bottles of wine.  You have to have a different wine for every tiny little pretty course they brought out.  And I'm like, please, you appreciate good wine?  Right.  And, uh.  Did you have to pay for this?  Uh, no, I guess not. 
[00:30:00]  I didn't know you were.  Oh, boy.  And don't call me like T-Rex arms or any of that crap I offered.  And Don's like, no, it's taken care of.  I'm like, alright, what do I have to do now?  You know, is this old school radio?  What, are we delivering coke to somebody?  Are we going to be, like, selling trips to the Dominican Republic?  What do I have to do in return for this, I guess, honor?  Your money's no good here, Mr. Torrance.  Right.  So I couldn't.  I think it was just enjoy it, and you still couldn't do that. 
[00:30:30]  No, because I was worried.  I'm like, I've got to get my sleep before the radio show.  See what I do for you people.  And so I couldn't enjoy the wine that was coming out.  I had, like, one glass.  But I guess we got the description of the chef's table at Gordon Ramsay at the London.  The chef's table at Gordon Ramsay at the London sits in the heart of the kitchen.  This luxurious table for up to eight guests offers an opportunity to witness the creativity of the chef de cuisine and his team firsthand. 
[00:31:00]  Dining at the chef's table is a truly interactive experience where you will enjoy direct contact with the chef de cuisine.  To create a bespoke menu.  Is that how you pronounce that?  I have no idea.  Based on the day's market produce.  Dishes can be tailored to individual dietary requirements.  Yeah, I had to tell them about all my allergies.  Oh, yeah.  Allowing all guests to enjoy this.  You're allergic to appreciation.  Right.  I'm allergic to being nice and peanuts. 
[00:31:30]  All five of your senses are mixed together just to make one aggravating ass.  Can you bring me some dishes that complement my personality?  That would be basically bland.  I need bland food.  Do you have tuna with nothing?  That will give me a lot of gas later.  All right.  So they tailor to individual dietary requirements, allowing all guests to enjoy this unique experience. 
[00:32:00]  Our sommelary, sommelare, sommelare, sommelare, yeah, that, will also be delighted to recommend wines to complement each course from one of the finest cellars in New York.  Sommelary.  Sommelary.  Try the wine.  Food.  Food.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, here's someone lingering longer.  This is, oh, well, of course, Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Hey, yo, all Don wants in return is to eat the marshmallow. 
[00:32:30]  So, oh, they brought out this marshmallow thing that was pretty tasty, I guess.  Good evening.  Good evening, sir.  Good evening.  No, I'm not going to trash the place.  The food was amazing.  I'm sure.  I guess I just, I guess I just, I got a Michelin star.  That's like a purple heart.  You don't even have to say that.  I got a Michelin fire.  The food was amazing.  Yeah.  It's like watching a nuclear bomb go off and go, that was kind of a big explosion, wasn't 
[00:33:00]  it?  It was quite a bang.  You think people got hurt?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The food was good.  Really, was it?  Yeah.  The sun's hot.  Of course, the food was good.  It was all right, man.  You know, Porsches were a bit small, but besides that, you had 10 of them.  What a big portion.  Go to McDonald's.  Really?  You used to eat yourself a Big Mac.  And then they were showing us all this stuff, like an Indian, like an Indian lemon that looked 
[00:33:30]  like it, I don't know, got hit with radiation or something, because it looked really weird.  It had all these, just put your hands together, I guess, and then kind of spread your fingers  out like this.  That's what the lemon looked like.  Like tentacles?  Yeah, it had tentacles.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah.  It looked like an octopus head, basically.  And I guess this particular thing is very rare, so they wanted to show us that.  And I'm like, oh, all right.  It was like foreign existence.  You had one on Valentine's Day at the best restaurant ever. 
[00:34:00]  At the chef's table.  At the chef's table.  And I was overheating.  If you cut it open, there's pearls inside.  Everybody got a pearl and a Rolex.  A Rolex.  He just handed out Rolex.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Jersey.  Charlie.  It's Joey.  Hey, Joey.  Hey, how you doing?  I just wanted to say to Opie, in honor of Black History Month, being in the kitchen with  Chef Ramsay, that's like freebasing with Richard Pryor. 
[00:34:30]  See, it's like freebasing Coke with Richard Pryor.  Imagine just sitting there, passing the pipe around.  Nice.  Or sharing a tranny with Jim Norton.  Right.  High-fiving each other.  Yeah, but I think a lot of the listeners from this radio show could relate, because we  allow an audience to watch us do our radio show every day when we go over to XM.  Yeah.  And I think a lot of those people leave that experience, just like I left last night.  Ah, I guess that's a big deal.  No, they don't.  You can see it on their faces. 
[00:35:00]  They're excited.  Oh, they're excited to watch us do the radio show?  That's the chef's table.  You should call that the chef's table from now on.  All right, from now on, if you come over to XM, we're going to call it the chef's...  The chef's table?  Why?  The chef's bleachers.  Got bleachers set up outside the glass wall.  Watch us create.  Yeah.  Almost cook the show.  Yeah.  That's great.  Look over and insult you every once in a while for their blank stares.  All right.  Well, I'll leave Don alone for a couple days then. 
[00:35:30]  Just makes me mad.  A couple of days for that?  A couple days, yeah.  I did tell him he's going to have to try a little harder.  For what?  Try a little...  Why?  Yeah, why?  See, people don't really understand the inside crap here.  It's...  Don really tries to, like, make me like him.  And I know that, so that's why I can't like him.  What do you mean try a little harder?  How much harder could you try?  What do you want him to do?  I kind of felt like he was being kind of a... 
[00:36:00]  Kind of a...  Like a kiss-ass last night.  Yeah.  He...  Oh, my God.  I just...  Yeah, no, no.  It's got to be an intervention.  It's just...  I know.  Try a little harder.  Chef's table at Chef Ramsay's Kitchen on Valentine's Day.  And he...  What could be trying harder?  Yeah, what could possibly be trying harder?  I'm kind of mad that he made me wear a suit jacket, quite frankly.  I actually had to wear a suit. 
[00:36:30]  What kind of place is this?  I got to wear a suit.  What?  Oh, God.  I'm trying a little harder.  I actually called him back.  I'm like, look, I'm wearing jeans.  I'll put on some nice shoes and maybe a nice, like, button-down shirt.  A suit.  And he goes, no, please, please look good for your lady.  I go, I look good for my lady.  He goes, no, really good.  Like, how good?  Like, you're going to a wedding.  I'm like, it's Valentine's Day.  During the week, I got to get up for a radio.  He goes, please, for me, for your girl, for Ronnie. 
[00:37:00]  So then I show up, and Ronnie B's all uncomfortable near the bar, too.  He was feeling the uncomfortableness of the situation.  He certainly appreciated the food, though.  I'm sure he did.  We all did.  I mean, it was definitely all right, man.  Yeah, because he knew what was going on.  After a second, he was like, oh, my God, this is kind of cool.  He was still sitting there sniffing, going, what was that?  Is that Indian lemon?  I don't like Indian lemon.  No, I like to smell the Indian lemon thing, whatever.  If we could find a picture for everybody, that would be kind of cool. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  Hey, we've got to move on to other things.  But we're going to get Ronnie B on the phone to talk about what he was feeling last night.  We'll let him sleep, though, the great Ronnie B.  We'll get him on a little later.  This happened late in the show yesterday, but it's definitely worth replaying.  Jane Fonda said the C word on NBC.  Dropped the biggie, what I call the hydrogen bomb of curse words.  It is the big one.  The C.  And I don't really care if she did. 
[00:38:00]  I don't really care at all.  What I do care about is if we dropped the C bomb, by accident, by the way.  Yeah.  And we have all sorts of safeguards in place.  We've got a guy down the hall.  Not even we.  A guest on the show drops it.  We've got a guy down the hall.  He's on a dump button.  And let's say the stars align and someone comes in here.  We had a sex bird on for Valentine's Day yesterday.  She could have easily have said it, right?  She says that word.  He is sipping coffee, forgets to dump out or what have you.  It's possible.  We are so fired. 
[00:38:30]  I can't even tell you.  In this day and age.  So fired.  And especially knowing that we didn't mean to say it.  It just kind of slipped out.  But stupid TV.  What's this going to happen?  And I think it's worse to say the C word on the Today Show than it is to say it on this radio show.  Absolutely.  They have about six million viewers.  Watching that.  And children, it's in the morning when they're getting ready for school. 
[00:39:00]  All the stupid excuses.  And believe me, more moms are watching that drivel than are listening to this show so their children could hear it.  And there's Jane Fonda.  Right.  The C-bomb.  Right.  Just drops it like the word the.  Yeah.  Didn't matter.  Just in case you missed it.  I mean, it's everywhere.  Especially today.  It's on every newscast.  It's in every paper.  It's great for ratings.  We can't play it yet.  What?  We can't play it.  Well, we got a bleeped version. 
[00:39:30]  So at least you kind of get the feel of where it was thrown in.  Yeah.  The bleep, obviously, is the word.  Amazing.  And I know when it started, there were some A-list celebrities who came out.  Talking about the vagina monologues.  You at first were not a big fan of the play.  So what turned you around?  Well, it wasn't that I wasn't a big fan.  I hadn't seen the play.  I live in Georgia.  Okay.  I was asked to do a monologue called, and I said, I don't think so.  I've got enough problems.  But then you were invited to go see.  And they just skated right over.  That never happened. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't hear it.  You didn't say it.  Bury your head.  Bury your head in the sand.  Yeah.  It's just funny, though.  It is hysterical.  Like I said, the only thing I care about is you do this on radio, everybody's fucked.  Everybody.  Like, GMs.  Fire.  Corporate people.  And they'll have to change formats.  I mean, all hell would break loose.  And, you know, all they have to do is a little apology.  Oopsie.  Yeah.  A little oopsie.  And now they're reaping the benefits of great ratings, because now everyone's going to 
[00:40:30]  be watching the Today Show this morning.  The potty mouth Today Show.  The double standard that is going on is ridiculous.  I mean, you don't think if Jane Fonda was on this show and she said that, you guys wouldn't  take the hit.  We would.  No, you wouldn't.  Jane Fonda.  First of all, the station would be fined, what is it, up to $350,000?  $350,000 or $60,000.  Per, per, I don't know.  Per station, I believe.  It's over $300,000.  Per station.  We're on a lot of stations still.  Yeah, yeah.  So this would be millions of dollars in fines. 
[00:41:00]  Millions.  And the FCC wouldn't even listen to the excuse.  No, no.  Oh, but you know, she's a guest.  And we'd go, oh, doesn't matter.  Went out.  Offensive.  Children.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, the C-word's the Alabama, obviously.  I mean, radio shows have gotten just destroyed by just the F-word slipping out.  Destroyed.  Yep.  So then, Meredith, this is the best they could do.  Before we go to break, in our last half hour, we were talking about the vagina monologues,  and Jane Fonda inadvertently said a word from the play that you don't say on television. 
[00:41:30]  It was a slip, and obviously she apologizes, and so do we.  We would do nothing to offend the audience.  So please accept that apology, and when we come up, we're going to be talking about the  secrets to making your love last.  And this story, of course, this is today.  I hate the double standard.  Hate.  And she just glosses over the apology, and everything's okay, and we'd have had to issue  statements that were never written by us, by the way.  No.  Yeah, I like to fill people in on these things before they ever happen, because when they 
[00:42:00]  happen, we're not even allowed to comment on them.  Whenever you hear a statement from Opie and Anthony, it's not from us.  Thank you.  It's written.  It's written by some brass upstairs.  It's called the job saver.  Yeah.  It's basically like if you're a hostage, and they say, read this.  Read this.  And there's a gun pointing at your head off camera.  The American policies are harmful, and America is a warlike nation.  That should not be here.  Meanwhile, the guy's got a gun to his head, and he's blinking out like, help me. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  That's what our statements are whenever we get in trouble.  Not one word came out of our mouths whenever any statement has been issued.  And I don't think a sorry should cover that.  You know, the I-man there, he was truly sorry.  Said he was.  Yeah.  And he lost his career.  I even went and talked to Negroes.  Yeah.  Shut up, you jerk. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  He's got a black girl on his show now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That helps.  Believe me.  Yeah.  A black girl.  I want an Asian child on my show so I could make some of those jokes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to get a, what they call a retard.  I want a retard on the show so I could goof on the Pete Rose haircut.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  And then I need a thalidomide baby so I can make flipper arm jokes. 
[00:43:30]  Because they're funny.  You know, flipper arm jokes.  Because I've decided all I got to do is get an air staff of freaks and various ethnic backgrounds.  Now hiring, I miss in the morning program, Eskimos.  We need Eskimos so I can make fun of whale blubber eating fat people. 
[00:44:00]  It's cold up there, baby.  I like mixing the old I-mis with the new I-mis.  She doesn't say yeah, baby, anymore.  Anthony's on to something.  The one thing I'll give Howard, he was smart enough back in the day to hire some black broad to just laugh at everything.  Oh, Howard.  And it wasn't because she was actually going to bring anything to the radio show.  She was there in that booth, by the way, where Travis now sits.  So Howard could do all that black humor without Reverend Al Sharpton and the gang getting on his ass. 
[00:44:30]  You know, that was really smart on his part.  And we've been told to do the very same thing over the years, and we just don't want to play that way.  No, it takes the fun out of the room.  Right.  Looking around.  Ugh.  You guys really went out of your way.  What?  All the interns you hired, they all look like little Amish boys.  We just wanted...  No, that's not us.  ...Aryan nation of interns that we have.  It's the same.  No, that's Steve.  Yes, yes.  I like them young, white and twink-like. 
[00:45:00]  Steve hires his type.  Yes.  The twink.  This is Steve's...  This is Steve's stable of twinks.  I'll dress them up like Hitler youth.  It's wonderful.  Hi, Steve.  Bunch of little, white, blue-eyed children.  I want to get them all pea coats.  I pat their little faces and go, I wish I had a hundred generals like you.  What's up, Steve?  No, I was just going to...  I'll show it to you when you go to break. 
[00:45:30]  Roland wanted to offer up his opinion on your Gordon Ramsay experience.  If the bosses go to fire me, I'm going to commit suicide.  Please take me out front and burn me.  I don't want to be captured and displayed.  That's right.  Steve.  What a creep.  Love Steve.  By the way, interns, they are his type.  It's like if you were picking interns and a bunch of hot girls were there, you would 
[00:46:00]  turn to the guy picking them and going, you're obviously picking your type.  Right.  Now we don't know Steve's type.  Young and tender and twink-like.  And that's how you executive produce.  Yes, that's how you executive produce.  I could train them.  I like having a young, malleable child to work with.  Soft like lead.  Forged into my own image. 
[00:46:30]  They're half twinks and half like bears.  Yes.  They're all little thin toys.  It's a hybrid like my car.  Yeah.  He really does have a hybrid gay bear.  I have hybrid gay people.  A twink bear.  He really makes that calculated.  Well, it's just fun.  Then it's ingrained.  The animated Steve is terrific.  It really is.  The latest animation from CokeLogic, which you can download for free if you go to iTunes  and go to the podcast section.  We have a whole section on iTunes in the podcast section, and it's a free download. 
[00:47:00]  We're not asking for anything.  I guess you've got to see a quick five-second commercial or something.  Whatever.  But Steve is animated, and it's great.  It's a good one.  He nailed you.  Yeah.  I don't think CokeLogic nailed me for the most part, but he absolutely nailed you.  What, Eric?  No, it's funny.  Well, it's funny because he asked for a photo of you, so he has your actual body, but he  photoshopped your head.  Yeah.  The latest animation is E-Roc's fridge with the door falling off.  It's really a funny bit.  Yeah, very funny. 
[00:47:30]  And Steve makes his first appearance in the CokeLogic animations that are just taking over  the world.  And it's not even him talking, which is the best part.  I don't know.  It's me and Jimmy doing the bad Steve impression.  So he's got two voices.  So going back to the chef table, I was at the chef's table last night at, I don't know,  a Gordon Ramsay restaurant or something like that.  And Steve, what did you just hand me?  Roland, who is a connoisseur of restaurants and chefs.  I guess it's in his family. 
[00:48:00]  There's a bunch of chefs in his family.  Okay, so this is his comment about my experience last night.  Let me read this to you, Anthony.  Bob, to have Opie do a radio show for you is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Opie is awesome.  His radio background is one that should be respected.  My dad is also in radio, and it's something earned, not given to you.  Wow.  Well, actually, he said, to have Chef Ramsay cook you up on the radio, that is a once-in-a-lifetime 
[00:48:30]  thing.  Chef Ramsay is awesome.  His culinary background is one that should be respected.  My dad is a chef, and it's something earned, not given to you.  I like the first one better.  Yes, right.  Hey, Black History Month, everybody.  Yes.  We got a brand new honor.  How much time we got left in Black History Month?  We're running out of days, unfortunately.  Like half over?  I'm loving this bit, though.  I think it's a good one.  It certainly is.  We might have to carry it over all year long.  Yeah.  Now, we'll do something different for March.  We'll figure out.  We'll make our own holiday. 
[00:49:00]  Why don't we play yesterday's honoree, and then we're going to play the brand new honoree  a little later in the show, okay?  Just in case you missed it yesterday, this is the honoree for Black History Month.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American  individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot  it is today.  Today, we honor Samuel L. Jackson and Halle Berry for their poignant roles in the racially  charged 1991 Spike Lee joint, Jungle Fever. 
[00:49:30]  Yo, there.  Would you let two loving brothers get a moment alone to get reacquainted?  You know what I'm saying?  Where the f*** am I supposed to go?  I don't know where the f*** I am.  I don't give a f*** where you go.  Can't you skin it after I'll f*** with you.  I'll get a motherf***er swing away from it.  I'm swang, motherf***er.  Never has such raw f***ing emotion been captured in one f***ing scene. 
[00:50:00]  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, moving right along with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Bob Kelly in studio today.  Bob, you promoting anything?  Yeah, I'm actually going to be at the Cleveland Improv. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, the 8th, February 20th, next Wednesday through the 24th.  So, I think I'm actually moving there.  Ohio?  I'm going to get an apartment for a month.  Four days.  Really?  Yeah, I might as well.  That's crazy.  He's there Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and doing shows Sunday night, too?  Sunday night, yeah.  Wow, you're blowing up.  Yeah.  Well, I was trying to take care of that.  He's working out.  I think I lost weight as Opie.  You definitely have lost weight.  Thank you, Opie.  Sorry, I don't look at guys like that.  It's not looking at me in a gay way. 
[00:51:00]  It's just looking less of me.  Okay, you have.  No, you have.  You can admit you're looking at a guy, and it's obvious that he's looking at a few pounds.  It's very obvious.  I don't really notice it, but you have.  It was very good.  Keep it up, Bobby.  I know.  You's got some guns, Bobby.  Yeah, I wouldn't mess with you.  All right.  Hey, a little definition.  I saw.  A little definition.  That's nice.  You've got to squeeze really hard and look just right, but I see something going on there.  Look just right.  In the right, exactly right lighting. 
[00:51:30]  My gay trainer, Bill, is just shredded, too.  It's embarrassing.  You've got a gay trainer.  He's like, sit down, do this.  Do the one that tells you to eat those bananas every morning.  It's called practice, honey.  We'll work your way up to holding two plums while you do it.  I'm getting communiques like crazy because now people are waking up that kind of know me and my personal life.  Yeah.  You know, I talked about the chef's table last night at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. 
[00:52:00]  Of which you had a complete lack of appreciation for.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, we'll re-explain a little later on.  But the Philly crew, check it in.  Lindsey's brother writes, Ray, who's another part of the Philly crew, Ray is so jealous of your night.  He says, watching Ramsay cook in his kitchen is like sitting on the bed while Ron Jeremy goes to town on some broad.  Well, there you go. 
[00:52:30]  Another fine analogy.  And it was really more like that when he spilt the New England clam chowder on Opie's lap.  All right.  I reached for it and I stumbled a bit.  I can identify.  I don't need Jimmy here to laugh at me.  Bobby gives me the same look.  Like, you're struggling, ass, aren't you?  I see it.  We got Big A in studio, but before we go to Big A, we have to play the Bronx, the Bronx-ish, the Bronx-ish tale. 
[00:53:00]  We, uh...  Oh, God, the Bronx-ish tale.  Oh, yeah, this is...  This is Steve and Derek.  They put together a fine piece of production here.  Basically...  It's amazing that we were able to do this.  Yeah.  Because Chas Palminteri, just a huge, giant actor.  I mean, he's fantastic.  I've never been shocked on this show.  That was like a TV moment.  Yeah, yeah, where they bring someone out and it's like, you don't expect it.  And he's become a friend of the show and he wanted to come back in and say hi before his Bronx-ish tale run is over down there on Broadway before he heads back to Hollywood. 
[00:53:30]  And we're like, all right, but we want to do something.  Are you game to do something a little different?  And he was so cool.  He's like, yeah, whatever you guys need.  You want to explain what happened?  And then Rich Voss, who was in here, Jimmy tells Rich that he wants to check out Rich's acting chops because, quite frankly, Rich is always talking about his acting prowess, how good he is at it. 
[00:54:00]  And Jimmy is always goofing on him that he's an abomination as far as acting goes.  So Jimmy gave Rich part of a script from a Bronx tale and said that me and you, Jimmy and Rich, will be doing this scene from a Bronx tale and then we'll all watch and see how well or awful Voss does.  And we had a lot of people in studio that day, including Bob Kelly, Patrice O'Neill, and a bunch of other people.  No one knew what we had planned.  No, and at the last minute, when Rich stepped up to the mic and we were going to go to the segment where him and Jimmy were going to do this scene from a Bronx tale, it's not Jimmy, Chaz Palminteri walks in. 
[00:54:30]  Door, yep.  At which point, Rich just pretty much craps.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's over.  Any confidence he might have been able to conjure up.  He was just a nervous, babbling wreck.  He was nervous doing this with Jimmy.  Yeah, he was, right, the second Jimmy gave him the script, he goes, I gotta study this. 
[00:55:00]  I gotta go to the bathroom and study.  He didn't know what he was doing.  He was beside himself.  And then when Chaz Palminteri walked in, he got so nervous.  And for him to do the scene, he was awful.  He was just awful.  If you could have taped his, videotaped his hand when you saw Chaz, his little fingers.  Did you see his hands when he was doing the lines?  They just kept going out in this, like as if you were to go, huh?  I don't know.  I don't know where it is.  What you do with your arms, you kind of go out. 
[00:55:30]  That's all he was doing.  That's the only body expressions he was making.  The contrast between an actor like Chaz Palminteri, who's fantastic, the natural way he just goes through lines,  and then the train wreck, that is Rich Voss, right after it, is just stunning.  It was a lot of fun.  So the guys took the audio and they put together this little piece.  Yeah.  Called.  Enjoy.  Called A Bronkish.  Bronkish Tale.  A Bronkish Tale. 
[00:56:00]  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say, it's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you, I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  A Bronkish Tale.  See what I mean?  See what I mean?  It's just, you hear all these great lines.  De Niro, Chaz Palminteri.  Yeah.  Louie, Beans. 
[00:56:30]  He's so over the top and awful.  Otis, he sucks.  He sucks in life.  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say, it's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you, I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  A Bronkish Tale.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on, what are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans. 
[00:57:00]  This guy owes me 20 and it's been two weeks now.  And every time he sees me, he keeps dying to me.  John, should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue with a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20. 
[00:57:30]  Come on, you got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A Bronx tale.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time.  Then I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  Brr.  Suddenly I'm freezing.  I've heard robots read better.  Did someone leave a douche window open?  I'm cold. 
[00:58:00]  He is such an ass.  He doesn't breathe.  No.  No.  I can't believe beans.  You read?  You read?  Huh?  Oh, God.  Mr. Faber-Sam?  But no, but now we know.  You understand?  Now we know.  Voss, funny guy.  Voss, great personality.  Been in the business 47 years.  Why?  Is the business really that mean? 
[00:58:30]  Is it really that unjust?  Yeah.  No.  Now we know.  Now we know.  Every audition, every shot he's ever had at opportunity in this business, he's done that.  That's exactly what they hear.  Now, anyone can hear that stinks on ice.  Could you imagine being a professional that auditions people and having that disaster walk in and read lines?  The second one word comes out of his mouth, you would instantly chalk up the rest of the time to a complete waste of your time.  He really does just get a check. 
[00:59:00]  The second, Louie Beans.  All right.  I hope the next guy's good.  Let me look down the list at the names.  Thank you.  He wouldn't get past Louie Beans.  Louie Beans.  Thank you.  Send in the next guy.  He couldn't sell pork and beans in a commercial.  Never mind Louie Beans.  Pork Beans.  He sucks.  It's uncomfortable.  It really is.  It's like hearing somebody sing Journey in their car while Journey's on. 
[00:59:30]  Don't stop.  Oh, he stinks.  With the windows down.  Let's say hi to Big A.  Big A!  Big A!  There he is.  Big A's shirt is actually going to kill people.  What's up, Big A?  Let's get the camera on Big A for a while.  Hey, get Sam in here, too, because Sam went out to L.A. with Big A.  They were hanging out at the Playboy Mansion, something I've never done.  Not many people have.  Yeah, we don't get that opportunity, Big A.  You've got a fine opportunity to hang out with the broads. 
[01:00:00]  Something I would have liked to have done.  Maybe I will in my career.  I hope he would have been like, what is this?  What is this, a birthday party?  Yeah, what?  What is going on here?  The Playboy Mansion?  What is this?  You wanted me to put pajamas on and do something called movie night?  Never heard of this.  I don't like going in caves, dude.  I don't want to go to the grotto.  The grotto?  What are there, nude girls?  Hey, hey, the nude girls is all right.  I would understand why that's cool, trust me.  But a chef's table in the middle of a kitchen, whatever. 
[01:00:30]  Whatever.  Hi, Sam.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Good.  So you've got some fine audio of Big A on the red carpet at the Playboy Mansion for  the Knight Rider premiere party.  Yes.  Big A and I were fortunate enough to be on the red carpet to interview all the celebrities  as they came through.  Ah, fortunate.  For the NBC Knight Rider premiere party.  Yeah.  Big A, you have a good time out there?  Yes, I had a great time.  I want to thank Opie and Anthony, Joe, and... 
[01:01:00]  I'll tell them when they come in.  Yes.  Can't you say I want to thank you guys?  Right.  I want to thank Opie and Anthony, the radio guys.  I go on their show occasionally.  You're on it, dummy.  Just say, you know, you're welcome.  Thank you.  Good.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're looking at us.  You can just thank us.  We kind of have a weird...  We actually have a relationship.  I don't know if you know that.  Not happy about it, but it is a relationship.  Somehow it blossomed.  Right.  I feel like I'm in the godfather every time he... 
[01:01:30]  Don Colleon.  I'd like to thank you on the day of your daughter's wedding.  Wedding on the day of her wedding.  That's Big A, all right.  I love Big A.  Sam, comments, how do you want to start this?  I will leave you now, Don Colleon.  Yeah, right.  I know you are a busy man.  Well, Big A, he's just staring.  Go choke yourself.  He's just staring.  Go get choked with a knife in your hand.  He's staring off into space.  Yeah, I know.  Thanks, Big A. 
[01:02:00]  That's a movie reference.  Oh, Big A?  Yeah, he just stares off into space.  Sam, I thought he might...  He seemed nervous when he first started, so I made sure to write questions for him because  I knew that, you know, he might have a tough time just coming up with them off the top  of his head.  Right.  And I quickly realized that one of the most uncomfortable positions to be in as a human  being is trying to avoid eye contact with a celebrity and their publicist as they realize  they've gotten into something that they...  They just don't want to be in.  Yes.  But they can't walk away from the retard because then TMZ will be on their ass. 
[01:02:30]  Exactly.  Not to think of it as a retard.  Oh, sorry, Big A.  Jesus.  He's not retarded.  He's not retarded.  He's not retarded.  He's not retarded.  He's not retarded.  He's sharp as a tack.  And that's the thing.  I'm telling you, Dane has that joke about always the crazy guy in the office and he always  gives him candy so that one day he comes in, he just kills everybody and then he goes  into your office and he goes, thanks for the candy.  Candy.  And then he walks away.  And blows his head off in front of you.  I always give Big A candy.  So when I'm in here and he snaps and he breaks your back over his knee and he grabs Anthony's 
[01:03:00]  head and just twists it off.  He's going to go, Bob, thanks for the candy.  Thanks for the candy.  All right.  I guess you're right.  Sure.  He just gave me the thumbs up.  Yeah.  Hey, you're fine.  These guys dead.  Spike W from New Hampshire writes, Voss reading with Chaz is like Opie going to dinner at  Oh, never mind.  That is.  Hey, yeah.  See, we both got to check off something on our bucket list. 
[01:03:30]  We got a bucket list.  Okay.  So should we just go to the audio?  Yeah.  The first guy is Bruce Davidson, who's what?  Well, he's in the New Knight Rider show and he was also in X-Men.  That's where people might recognize him from.  What's this X-Men?  It was an independent film.  No, it was kind of a big movie.  It was an indie film, a limited release.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was he in X-Men?  I think he was one of the politicians.  You'd recognize him if you saw him.  Basically, nobody.  Correct.  All right, let's go to Big A interviewing Bruce Davidson. 
[01:04:00]  Okay.  Hi, I'm Big A.  I'm here with Bruce Davidson.  What stands out to you as one of the main differences between the new Knight Rider and the old one from...  The new car is much more stealthy. 
[01:04:30]  You know, the old one was a little flashy and a real muscle car.  This one sort of hangs back a bit.  Sort of like a...  More like a stealth bomber.  Why wouldn't you acknowledge what's going on?  That sounds like...  Like, what the hell?  I would be like, what the hell is wrong with you?  That sounds exactly like Chaz and Voss doing a scene. 
[01:05:00]  Wow.  That is painful.  Okay, that's who he is.  I thought that's who he was.  He's the guy that kind of turned into water.  Oh, really?  Splashed on the table.  That guy.  Yeah, the politician guy.  Say stealthy for us, Big A.  I'm stealthy.  All right.  That only took five seconds.  That's not bad.  You're getting better.  That wasn't very stealthy at all.  Why don't you acknowledge that there's something going on? 
[01:05:30]  They're very uncomfortable.  They must have just been like, oh my God, please, I hope this is over.  What would have been hilarious if he went, could you repeat the question?  Yeah.  Easy for you to say, because it wasn't.  Yeah.  Let's move right on to the next one.  Big A asked Bruce.  He actually stayed for another question?  Oh, yeah.  All the celebrities, they tried their best not to acknowledge it.  They had that glassy-eyed look, like, oh, and they had this smile plastered on their face,  like, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, like as if there was nothing going on. 
[01:06:00]  And were you just mortified?  Were you just uncomfortable in your own skin?  I was shaking with tears coming down my eyes, because I was laughing and just staring at  the recorder, pretending I was checking levels.  See, I live for moments like that.  Live for moments like that.  I love being in that uncomfortable state like that.  Looking around at everybody's uncomfortableness.  Dude, you are plugged in all wrong.  Someone got your VCR and messed up the wires in the back, dude. 
[01:06:30]  I love living in that zone.  You feel uncomfortable at a five-star restaurant at the chef's table.  You feel comfortable watching somebody stutter through a conversation on a red carpet.  Oh, absolutely.  That's great.  All right, here's Big A.  And how, um, how, um, how, how steamed, um, um, would you be if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if statistically night writer did not live up to the studio's expectations? 
[01:07:00]  How steamed would I be?  I don't know how steamed I'd be.  I'd be upset.  I'll tell you, I would really look forward to this going, because I think it's quite a ride.  Let me tell everybody, uh, how much of an ass Sam is, and why I love him.  See, most people know that, uh, Big A can't say S-T words.  S-T words are, yeah.  All these questions have an S-T word in them. 
[01:07:30]  Or, why would you say how steamed?  Steamed.  Hey, you got rice.  You mean, I couldn't believe he had trouble with-  You're getting me steamed.  How steamed would you be if, statistically, the show didn't live up to the studio's expectations?  That was my fault.  I had no idea.  What would they do after, like, you turned, uh, off the, like, the recording device?  Every time it was just, uh, thank you, thank you.  And they just moved on quickly?  Yeah, just ran away.  We were, we were the last, uh, spot on the carpet, and so a bunch of people tried to 
[01:08:00]  walk right by us, and both Big A and myself would say, oh, oh, excuse me, excuse me, and  then a publicist would see a microphone, so they'd be like, oh, yeah, talk to this person.  They're with Opie and Anthony, because they had the markers on the carpet, and then as soon  as it started, the publicist was just, like, looking as if, like, okay, is that your last  question?  And Big A would just keep going.  Did you like the Playboy Mansion, Big A?  Uh, yes, um, very nice, and I had a great time. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, good.  I heard you were hitting on the girls and stuff, is that sure, Sam?  Yes, he was.  Beautiful girls.  Kick-Kick Club.  Did you get close with any of these, uh, ladies?  No, huh?  Nothing?  Not really, no.  No.  Nothing?  He tried to, but they were literally running away.  Really?  He was chasing them, though.  Literally running away.  Yes.  Running.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You can't wait for, like, ten years from now when he moves, Hef's dead, and he moves  out, and they find, like, just one body behind the pool.  No wonder.  Just, like, a grave dug with big hands. 
[01:09:00]  And anger.  Yeah.  You can just see the way it was dug with anger.  Her fibula bone is snapped in half.  Fibula.  Let's see.  Did she break it or something at some point?  Fibula?  Fibula.  There you go.  Fibula.  Yeah, Fibula.  That's my sister's name.  Yo, Fibula.  Fibula, what's up?  Fibula.  Yeah.  Get over here. 
[01:09:30]  We, uh, we have time for one more before the break.  Big A asked girls with painted-on shirts, so they were nude?  Yeah.  Oh, the body paint stuff?  Yeah.  Wow, that's not clothes?  I see the picture now.  The lighting's a little weird, so it looks like they're actually wearing clothes, but that's  all just painted on?  Yeah, they painted on, like, black t-shirts and the Knight Rider logo across the front.  And they have nothing on?  Right.  Wow.  Nothing.  That is cool.  So, uh...  That's crazy, dude.  Big A asked girls with painted-on shirts how they applied their outfits. 
[01:10:00]  They then break his heart?  Yeah, these chicks weren't even actually doing interviews.  They just got on the red carpet to take pictures for people.  Yeah.  But we stopped them and just started talking to them, and then, yeah, they kind of were  a little mean to Big A, I thought.  Breaking his heart is cholesterol.  I don't think this girl's...  Here we go.  Hi.  Hi, um... 
[01:10:30]  Big A from Open Anthony Show.  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  Was it painted?  Um...  Painted on?  Or...  Or...  Or...  Or...  Or...  Or...  Or...  Or...  Or...  Fuck on?  Paint it on.  You know?  Yes.  Um...  Um...  Um...  What are you beautiful girls with me?  What do you think about dating?  A guy like me?  If I were single, I definitely would. 
[01:11:00]  Are you just saying that, or really?  Eric, you're just saying it.  Thank you so much.  I mean, he just gives up.  Thank you so much for the rejection.  I'd hate that fake.  Well, if I was single.  If I was single.  At least they were honest afterwards.  Are you just saying that?  Yes.  I'm just saying that.  I would never go out with you in a million years. 
[01:11:30]  Even if I lost three out of my four limbs, I still wouldn't go out with you.  That's when his big hand went over her skull and he smooshed it.  Yeah.  Very, very funny, man.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got the big get.  I mean, they actually talked to Hugh Hefner.  Yeah, the guy.  Yes, we've definitely got to get to that.  How excited big A is.  He's all confident about this one.  Oh, yeah, of course he is.  I think he did a great job out there.  He did a great job.  So far?  So far, right?  I'm, yeah, totally captivated by this. 
[01:12:00]  No, wait a minute.  Both of you guys, don't try to give him candy like me.  You guys are smashing him when he walked in.  I'm still getting my neck twisted off, like you said.  Yeah.  Big A singing Hey There, Delilah.  We got that?  Yeah, listen to this.  Big A, everybody.  Hey there, Delilah.  Don't you worry about the distance right there.  You get lonely.  Here's the song I'm not listening.  Close your eyes. 
[01:12:30]  This is my voice.  It's my disguise.  I'm by your side.  Oh, what you do to me?  Oh, what you do to me?  Covered in blood.  Put your knife in the bathtub.  What you do to me?  Leg in his hand.  Oh, what you do to me?  Carrying her leg around like it's a drumstick.  Seems like a crooner from the 20s. 
[01:13:00]  Just gnawing on it.  He's actually playing air guitar with her leg.  Oh, man.  Sitting on her head like it's a stool.  Oh, God.  Cuts her head off first and then uses it as a stool to cut the rest of her.  Oh, what an image you're conjuring up there.  Uses it as a stool.  More with Big A after the break.  But let's go to the F.U. line on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:13:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, this is Brad.

[01:15:00]  On the Opie and Anthony show  Sam in studio  He went out to L.A. with Big A  For I guess the Knight Rider premiere, right?  Yeah, Knight Rider is this Sunday at 9 p.m.  Ooh, look at you  On NBC  Corporate loves you  The new Knight Rider  Yeah, it's a movie event  Brown nose!  So, and then the party was at the Playboy Mansion  Something I really have always wanted to do  We just don't get invited  We don't get invited 
[01:15:30]  I don't understand  But they invited Big A  Well, I guess technically they didn't  They were surprised by Big A's presence  Who wouldn't be?  So we threw him on the red carpet  This is something we've done a couple times over the years  People are like yelling and screaming  It's a stuttering John thing, whatever  Trust me  We could do a whole segment where I list a whole bunch of things we did  Way before Howie did  So just relax  Relax  Alright, there's your acknowledgement  Now go screw  It's like stuttering John like ten times over though 
[01:16:00]  Go screw  Yeah  Go hit somewhere else  He actually got words out  Yeah, he got words out  And just to hit one that he kind of got stuck on  Big A gets stuck on all of them  I love the haters too  Watch, they'll never even acknowledge that this was  Similar to what he did twelve years ago  Blind CC  Blind CC  Blind CC  Copy paste  Copy paste  Fake name on a message board  Fake name on a message board  Blind CC  Shut up  Now what? 
[01:16:30]  There you go  There's your acknowledgement  Now what?  Now what?  And is Big A asking outrageous questions?  No  No  See, Big A is talented enough to just ask normal questions and still horrify people  Yeah  He doesn't have to go for the bad question  He was nervous  He was nervous  Of course he was  So it was like 55 degrees maybe at that point  Because it was like evening  And so it was getting chilly  He was the only one on the red carpet  His whole forehead was just beating sweat 
[01:17:00]  And he kept coughing the whole time  Like he wasn't doing it when the celebrities were there  But he kept leaning over and like hat coughing on the other people  Oh no  Did he have that big rape vein on his forehead?  Bob Kelly in studio for Norton  You just hear a woman going  And all I remember is this big vein in his forehead just throbbing  It's okay  Okay nurse, get the kit  There's another observation here too by the way 
[01:17:30]  I want to have a bet with the guys today  When that button is going to officially pop off your shirt  Oh my god  That thing is struggling to stay on the shirt  Yeah  Sorry big A  What the  What the hell was that?  I thought that was it right there  Wow  I thought that was it  I swear to God my heart stopped  And I was just praying that I wasn't on his list  Yeah he's got a  Whatever he just did  I thought that was it  Like his brain just went 
[01:18:00]  It's over  He's got  He's the only person I know that has like boulders for cholesterol  Just rolling through his body  Just hoping they could squeeze through the  Yeah wow  That'll lead to his heart  Jesus  The big A  The button is a little  Wow that is under stress  A little tight man  You should undo that button  Just that one  No  It doesn't stop  It's like trying to hold back mercury  That liquid metal  You can't do it  Hey let's  Alright so we got big A asking wolf siren 
[01:18:30]  I can't take my eyes off of that button  I'm frightened it's gonna go off like a rivet in a submarine that's too deep  Yeah someone's gonna  Someone's gonna lose an eye big A  Someone loses an eye today  The thing is gonna take out an eye  That's funny  Hey uh so we got  We got big A asking wolf siren and stealth from American Gladiators about uh the joust  Yeah he got to big A got to meet all the American Gladiators 
[01:19:00]  Wow wow that's a big one  Yeah  It's huge  All the big celebrities  And so yeah he got to interview uh  Now I'm officially jealous  Now I can understand why that would be a big deal  Yeah  Are you really?  No  Okay I'm just checking  You know he has headphones on too right?  Yeah  I just noticed that  Yeah  Okay  Holy Jesus  Alright cause he's staring at the back of your head  Yeah now he's waving at us  He's actually squeezing  Even when he waves it's uncomfortable  He just bit his ring off  He could just stand up and like Predator pull my spine out 
[01:19:30]  Okay I get it you hate me  I wasn't a big fan of American Gladiators when it was called American Gladiators back in 1989  Or whatever it was  Well this one is bigger and better  Wow  Is it really?  There's a rousing endorsement  Yeah and as a matter of fact the season finale is on right before the Knight Rider movie  Oh wow  It's Sunday night  Whoa  Brown days  Yuck  You're gonna do great in sales 
[01:20:00]  Congratulations  This one is a little better  I love it  They actually get the gladiators really get violent and hate the competitors  Sam when you're in radio sales at some point in your career  Don't talk about how you used to be on the air and stuff  Because the talent really doesn't care  Okay  So remember that  You're a salesperson  You're in your suit  You shake hands with the talent when they come in to meet a client  Don't be like  Oh I was on the air  Oh yeah you might remember  Fan and Sam show 
[01:20:30]  And it's on the Opie and Anthony show  They don't want to hear it  Alright I'll keep that in mind  Thank you  And happy Black History Month  We forgot to acknowledge that  Oh thank you  He only gets to participate in two days of it though  Two?  I was thinking half a day  But alright two days  Just some indiscretion by President Jefferson years ago  One night Mrs. Jefferson wasn't in the mood  He had to go out to the old shack and back and take care of business 
[01:21:00]  And then your ancestry got back on the white highway  The old branch of the Sam family tree  He would play the black Harry Potter  Sam's white ancestry  He was on the white road  Yep  They had to take a leak  So they went into the black rest area  Yep  And then they got back onto the white  Back on the highway  The white highway  But the memory is always there  It's all speculation 
[01:21:30]  Well you were related to Jefferson  Yes that is true  Yeah he checked his ancestry  And it goes back to Jefferson  And Jefferson was just known  To take a few trips out to the shack  To take care of business  He's related to the side that they don't really acknowledge  They don't like acknowledging that one  Read a book and you'll see what I mean  Let's just say they're not on any money  No  No  Big A asked Wolf, Siren, and Stealth  From American Gladiators about the joust  Wolf, Siren, and Stealth  Big A at the Playboy Mansion 
[01:22:00]  Who?  Hi I'm Big A  On the Open Anthony show  I'm here with Wolf, Siren, and Stealth  Hey how are ya?  Okay  Do you find it hard to stay stationary when performing the joust?  To stay stationary  Stationary  Yeah  It's tough you know  The nervous laugh  She has a little easier time than like myself 
[01:22:30]  Because she has a  Really low squat  Like a shorter wheelbase  You know like kit  But yeah she can squat a little lower  She you know  I don't step back a little  And all of a sudden there's no more platform for me  So she has a little more room  My favorite part of that was when the publicists announced them  And they're like  And this is Stealth  And Big A just goes  Oh  Oh  Oh  S-T word  Why  Why  Why  The gladiators pick a name for Big A 
[01:23:00]  And basically just call him fat?  Yeah I thought  When they were picking  They started picking American gladiator names for Big A  And I thought they were being really insulting  Yeah  You could like  Like mountain  Yeah  You could call him mountain  Or planet  Mountains  Planets  Is that insulting?  Because it's saying he's very  Oh  Stature is  How about earthquake?  Take earthquake's name from the WWF  Earthquake is kind of a good name  Yeah I like that  Steven S. from Bayshore 
[01:23:30]  The guy had to blow dry his hair after this interview  Big A did have a little bit of a  Spittle?  Yeah  A problem with a little bit  You know drool on the corners of his back  Oh was that happening?  You're a little nervous and dry mouth?  Yeah  Yeah you got a little dry mouth  I imagine Big A is always dehydrated  He didn't need to send out  Did he have the white in the corner  Like he just ate like 90 marshmallows?  Yeah he did  Mosh  I love the Boston accent 
[01:24:00]  90 marshmallows  Alright let's see what this clip's about  Do you think I have a proper  You know body  Of physique  To be an American gladiator?  Any day my friend  The gauntlet  I've been trying to pick a name for you  And I haven't quite got it  But  We're gonna think  Chomper  Something like a mountain  Or rock  You know  I think he'd be good  Do you really think he'd be good? 
[01:24:30]  I think  Disgusting  How about that for a name?  Disgusting  You know what I hate about these people?  As soon as they walk away  They would obviously say to each other  What a fat mess  Yeah  Fat mess  Why do we have to talk  Talented  Yeah  Why do we have to talk to that  Fat mess  They fight each other with  Like a  A huge Q-tip  And they think it's talent  A huge Q-tip  Stink  Big A should be one of the events  Actually  Yeah  We're just gonna put him in an alley 
[01:25:00]  You have to get by him  With your clothes on  What do we got next  Big A  We gotta get to the big Hugh Hefner interview  It's the  It's just unbelievable  It's the highlight  Yeah  It's awesome  What's next  Someone said his name  Cholesterol  Cholesterol  Very good  The other ones  I mean that's the rest of the Gladiators  If you wanna just skip to  Well  You got Big A  He's asking Mayhem  Militia and Helga  And Justice 
[01:25:30]  About American Gladiators  Coming back  Is that worth playing?  The only part that's worth playing  Is that Big A  Might have had a little crush on Helga  Okay  Oh  Helga  So we'll go to that club  With a sexy name like that  I can understand  Helga  You were actually flirting with Helga?  Oh yeah  A little bit  She's a mountain of a woman  I heard you also got really hammered  At the Playboy Mansion  Huh?  You like your drink?  Get your drink on there Big A  I heard  I heard eight rum and cokes 
[01:26:00]  Oh my god  Perhaps  Some more  Yeah  Perhaps more than that  He was shouting out  I feel no pain  Physically  Was he scaring  Was he scaring people out there?  Yeah he was  I mean  She's on the news again  Oh no  You know what  Don't  That's what gets us fired  I'm sorry  Didn't mention the channel  And he was the other day  On channel 11  That's a repeat of his channel  Because after we went into the party  Yeah  He kept going up to the celebrities 
[01:26:30]  That we'd seen on the red carpet  And trying to talk to them  And thanking them for the interview  And it was so uncomfortable  Like I would turn  I wouldn't even coax him into doing it  I would turn around  And he's trying to find the American Gladiators again  To reminisce about the interview  Remember the interview we did  Here's him flirting  That's Helga  What quality of men do you like?  Intelligence  Whoa  Wait a minute 
[01:27:00]  Oh wow  That's  Big A's gay?  Allegedly a what?  You gay?  Big A  No  But that's  You're talking to a man  You're flirting with a dude  No that's Helga  Well let me tell you  What I like in a man  She does look like Steve  Wow really?  That's a  That's a  That's a broad huh?  What quality of men do you like?  Intelligence  Muscle doesn't hurt though  That sounds like 
[01:27:30]  A guy  And would you ever think of dating a man  Like myself?  Well I don't know  I don't know much about you  Tell her about you  Tell her about you  Tell her about you  Well actually  We could talk at the party  And  Oh yeah  Definitely  That sounds good  Look at a bottle of Chrissy  A couple drinks  And you know  Okay  I'm gonna be able to play 
[01:28:00]  Hey  Big A's got some game  And a little humor  Behind him  She laughs like Gene Hackman  I thought it was all in good fun  Like it was just  As soon as we got into the party  I turned around and lost Big A  And he was at the bar  Talking to Hal Gunn  Really?  Oh wow  Straight for her  You walked the walk too  You're like man women  Man  Alright Big A  Is she good?  Did she arm wrestle?  No I didn't  What did she  Did she talk back?  Was she into you?  Not really  No? 
[01:28:30]  She knew he was coming  Because her drink on the bar  Started vibrating like Jurassic Park  Behind that creepy smile  He's got game and a sense of humor  Who knew?  Did you make any moves?  What did you say to her at the bar?  Um  How big's your  I love my beepy button  He just ruined it  With that little gay thing after it  I love my beepy button  Oh shut the f*** up  Say I love my beepy button  I do 
[01:29:00]  Wow  Alright now we finally get to Hugh Hefner  We gotta move forward here  So what can you tell me about the Hef?  Well he was doing all the TV  There's a lot of TV like Extra and all those shows  And so he was just about to get off the red carpet  And for whatever reason his publicist turned around  When we were shouting  You know Hugh Hugh Mr. Hefner Mr. Hefner  And he went straight for Big A  And within I would say  Five seconds he realized  It was not a place he wanted to be  It was an awful mistake had been made  Yeah  But we got him 
[01:29:30]  I'm Big A  From the opening  And Anthony  The show  I'm here with Hugh Hefner  Um  What brings you  This is who touched  Us  Us  The arms  Cutting  The event  Something about the event  Um  What brings you  To us  What brings  To our  Studded  How do you think of such  Destruous women  Is that what you're trying to ask him? 
[01:30:00]  Oh no  Go F yourself  The stupid publicist  Ah the publicist  At this point  No one gives a crap  That he's got three fake girlfriends  Go screw yourself  Is that what you wanna ask him?  Shut up  Shut up  Bitch  You should've told her  That's way more interesting  Than wow Hugh  I see you got your three girlfriends  With ya  Yeah  So how do you handle  Three girls Hef?  Oh you're crazy  I don't  Why doesn't anyone 
[01:30:30]  Say it  Hugh you got three fake girlfriends  I mean it's great for the magazine  And stuff  But obviously it's fake  And you're not really  Banging these broads  Listening to him  Ask that question  Is painful  Uncomfortable  It's the most funny  Painful  Uncomfortable thing  I've ever felt  It's a range of emotions  Yeah  I haven't felt since junior high  That painful  Yeah  Cause Hef couldn't really hear him  And so like  But he wouldn't lean in  That close to Big A 
[01:31:00]  And so  The publicist  Grabbed the notebook  Out of Big A's hand  And read the next question  So he didn't even get a chance  To say statuesque  She grabbed the notebook  Out of his hand  Alright let's  See how this goes down  How do you find  Such statuesque women  Is that what you're trying to ask him?  How do you find  Such statuesque women  For the magazine?  Oh statuesque women?  Yes  Well these days  They kind of find me  Huh 
[01:31:30]  I  I've  I've never hit a woman before  Really haven't  I want to punch that lady  In the face  You've never hit a woman  In your life?  How do you find  Such statuesque women?  I hate her  I hate her  That wasn't the  Question you  Oh slow down  Jane Fonda 
[01:32:00]  I love what he  Is defeated  She goes  Is that the question?  Is that the question?  Hugh's a very busy man  Why not?  Yes  He's got to walk around  The party with his  Three broads  So everyone can say  Wow look at Hugh Hefner  Doing great still  At the age of 80  Shut up  Shut up  Alright find  Such statuesque women 
[01:32:30]  We got one more  Hugh Hefner clip?  They find me  Drooling on my chest  Right  In a lazy boy  You know  God bless Hugh Hefner  But you know  You gotta call it  Like you see him  I mean that's  Such a great  Great ruse  Wait you don't think  You don't think he's  There's nothing going on  With those three broads  No way  Nothing  He had four  One ran off with  Rob Schneider  At a roast party  God  Yeah  That's how much  These girls wanted to 
[01:33:00]  Get away from him  They ran up to  Rob Schneider  And said save me  Well you know  Bobby as a  As a bisexual man  Yes  Would you have  Wait a minute  Wait a second  Hey wait a second  You know  As you said that  It just slipped right past me  And I didn't even question it  I'm like yeah okay  I told Greg Hughes that  I didn't tell Opie from the ONA show that  I am  I'm pretty close  I'm as close as you can get  I have a bidet  Anyway 
[01:33:30]  We got one more Hugh Hefner clip  Yeah at this point  He had no humor about him whatsoever  He was just annoyed  Ah good  Why this is something different  He's gotta be bored with the same little crap  This is something different  Why not just go with  Roll with the punches man  Um  If I behave myself  Tonight  Um  Um  Could I  Start  Coming here  More regularly  It depends on the nature of the event  Ooh

[01:39:00]  The excitement around this place  Knowing that you were  Coming in today  From these guys  Just unbelievable  I'm glad you like the show  Yeah  Yeah  You got tons of fans  Of Lost here  Ben from Lost  Of course  And great to have you here  Huge fan of the show  Like Upset  As is everybody  Thanks  And the  When you were in the  In the green room  I guess a few people  Came in to say hi  Yeah, that's right  And Travis came out  And just went  Oh my god  He looks just like him  It's like yeah 
[01:39:30]  It's the actor  He plays him  You're a dolt  It's just so exciting  I mean, go on  There is  I was saying before  Wow  We came back also  About the writer's strike  Yeah  It upsets  So many people  But the people  I noticed the most upset  Were Lost fans  Because you want to see  A full season  Yeah, there was  I was at a picket  By Time Warner  One day  And a car drove by  And somebody was  Hanging out the back window  And they said  We're with you 
[01:40:00]  Go for it guys  But give me my loss  Yeah  That's what everybody  Was just eager to see  Is like  What's going to happen here  They can't just  Drop it off  It's bad enough  When the season ends  It's dropped off  And we don't know  What the hell's going on  I don't want to see  Half a season  This show  I've never loved  And hated something  More in my life  Every time it ends  You're like  What?  Why would you do that to me?  It is one of the most  Talked about shows  Obviously I've got to ask you 
[01:40:30]  When you first signed on  Did you see the potential  For this  When you first signed on?  Well I came into the show  Late  I came in the middle  Of season two  It was already  A pretty big hit  When I got there  But I didn't  Sort of realize  The full scale of it  I should have taken  My cue from my wife  Who has been a  Hardcore lostie  Since the pilot  Yeah  I should have known  That something big  Was up  Did you know  You were going to be  On the show  When the show started?  No  No  No  Because I 
[01:41:00]  As they've said  Many times  Everything's planned out  Everything's written  They know the story  From beginning to end  So I assume  Everyone was cast  Everybody  Oh no  See that's why  I think that's a bunch of  They do have a master outline  Yeah  I'm sure  But within that framework  There's wiggle room  There's room to improvise  And I think the character of Ben  Was sort of a try out character  Really?  I think they felt like  They wanted to put a  You know  A face and a voice  Onto the adversary 
[01:41:30]  In the show  But if I hadn't worked out  Or if that character  Hadn't worked out  I think they'd have been  Happy to kill me off  And go in a different direction  Well obviously  It took off  What would you  Attribute that to  Because  You're not very likable  On the show  But there is something  A bit charismatic  About you  On the show  But why do you think  People have taken to you  So much  I think because  It's ambiguously played 
[01:42:00]  The character is mysterious  We think we have evidence  To suggest that he's villainous  But we can't quite be sure  He has a kind of a candor  And maybe a little bit of charisma  That keeps us sort of off balance  Yeah  Plus they showed you as a kid  And all the bad stuff  Your dad  That's right  And you were like a good person  And then you actually  What you did  Wasn't  It was kind of revenge  Which you know  Which anybody would do  Yeah  And all we see too 
[01:42:30]  Is behavior and effects  We don't know what the motives are  We don't know what the agenda is  I think a day will come  When we find out  What Ben's real mission is  And we may see him  In a much more heroic light  The  Our buddy Jim Norton  Who's not here today  Is a fan  But he's just catching up  And it was pretty funny  Because he's on  I guess he's on season two  I believe so  And he goes  Who's coming in from Lost  I go Michael Emerson  He goes  Oh who does he play  And it's like  Oh no  Yeah  You know the guy  In the balloon 
[01:43:00]  That crashed  It's him  Like because  And what was his name  What was your name  When you first  And you were lying  About your name  Henry Gale  Yeah  Henry Gale  It's like  Oh Henry Gale  Yeah  You've missed a lot  You really have to catch up  And it's kind of good  He's not here  Because it would ruin it  And that's been a huge thing  Too with Lost  People do not want to know  It's like  Don't tell me  I have a T-vote  Or I haven't seen it yet  I'm going to get it on iTunes  Whatever it is  It's really one of those shows  Where people don't want to know 
[01:43:30]  What happens  Well everyone appears to be  Begging for spoilers  But nobody really wants them  Yeah  I mean the landscape of the show  Is that set of mysteries  And if you give those away  Then  You don't want them  Directly given away  But a lot of people  Are searching out clues  They want to draw their own conclusions  And then see if they're right  Because we were talking about  The amount of websites out there  That are dedicated to Lost  That take every little piece of the episode  Chop it up  Get pictures of it  Enlarge them  And you don't know 
[01:44:00]  If that was just a glitch in a prop  Or if it really is a clue  I know  It's like the Zapruder film  Yeah  People have just overanalyzed it  Crazy  Do you look at those websites at all  And get a laugh  I don't go on them often  But I have a brother  Who's kind of a computer guy  And he checks them out for me  Yeah  And gives me a report  On the coolest stuff  It had to be the best line  In TV history  At the end of last season  When Sawyer shot the guy  And you know he's going to say something 
[01:44:30]  You think he's going to say something  Stereotypically  He goes  That's for taking the kid off the boat  The best line ever  It is a great collection of characters  I mean that you  And that's such an important thing  In a show  Is to have  The audience have a relationship  With the characters on there  And they've built such strong  Characters on Lost  And I think it's because of the format  The flashbacks  And now the flash forwards  Really gets to build  The story of these people  Instead of just  Here they're on an island 
[01:45:00]  Deal with this  You don't know what they were before  Or what they're going to become  But the show really gives you that  And I think it's a genius way to do it  Yeah  It does have a really universal appeal  I think that's partly the casting  Partly the way the story works  I mean everybody  Sort of gets the feeling  Of what it would be like  To be lost somewhere  In a place  Where you were up against  Issues of trial  And redemption  Having to examine  And make up for 
[01:45:30]  Past crimes  Or mistakes  In your life  I mean that's a sort of  A universal idea  Yeah  And it's a great way  To bring in new characters  Which is something that  At the beginning  The first episode  You'd be like  Now what are they going to do  Okay it's these people  I'm sorry but we have  Gilligan's Island here  We're going to  You know  Have these people  And have to  Watch what they do  But it's amazing  The ability  With that storyline  To just bring in new people  And kill off favorites  Which is something  That is so odd 
[01:46:00]  Yeah  To see on a successful show  People dying  It sucks as an actor  To be on that show though  Because you could just  Be gone next week  But then you're back again  In a flashback  Or a flash forward  Or something  You know you're still  Seeing these people  Yeah  William Matpother  Who plays Ethan  Says he has now  Officially been in  More episodes  Since he was killed  Dead  Than he ever was  When he was alive  Now probably very  Very recognizable now  These days  When you go out  I have been noticed  On the street 
[01:46:30]  Do people treat  Now I'm sure  You're not like Ben  But do people  Kind of approach you  As that character  With that  They do  People are really polite  With me  I bet they are  A guy like Jorge  When he goes around  Everybody wants to  You know  Slap him on the back  And buy him a beer  Yeah yeah  With me  There's a little more formality  They're very nervous around you  They keep their distance a bit  And reach out to shake my hand  And they keep their eye on me  Any part of that in you  Because I know  A lot of people  Bring their personalities  To a role 
[01:47:00]  But any part of that Ben character  In you  Well I think I'm  Sort of slightly formal  And I'm  And I'm kind of a verbal  Kind of a person  But I'm nowhere near  I think as chilly  Or as calculating  As he is  He is a great bad guy  If he is a bad guy  Right  That's just it  You know  You just don't know  But he's not  He's not physically  Menacing at all  You're just this  Little guy with glasses  Yeah 
[01:47:30]  And you scare the hell  Out of people  It's like  How do you do it  It's that  Those eyes  And you  You just stare at them  But you know  That you have something  Psychological  That you were working on  Two months ago  With somebody  That's going to come into play  Yeah  Yeah  I think that's  That's sort of the concept  Is that the  Package  Is at odds  With the contents  He looks like  The least likely  Guy  To be  You know  A criminal mastermind  I know  I enjoy  And people have enjoyed 
[01:48:00]  Especially the past  Few episodes  You just getting  The crap beat out of you  You've been punched  In the face  More times  They can't  They can't go  Any further with it  Yeah  It's like  Everyone has hit you  At this point  I'm waiting for  Just some extra  To come up  And pop you in the head  There's nowhere left to go  They run out of places  To put wounds  On my head  I mean  No one ever looked worse  In a speaking part  On broadcast TV  Than I did last night  No  Just pummel  But finally  I was telling him  In the agreement 
[01:48:30]  Finally last night  There was a point  Where they were talking  About him  And he just looked like  You know what dude  I just need a break  I don't want to take over  The universe right now  I just need a break  Just let me sit on a rock  And everybody  Has to ask you  Spoilers  And stuff  And I'm sure  You're  You're pretty tight-lipped  About that  Because they  Don't want you  Talking about it  But anything  You could tell us  Well  And you catch me  At a vulnerable time  I'm in a dangerous position  Because I actually know 
[01:49:00]  Four or five more episodes  Than you have seen  Damn it  And there's some  Good stuff in there  And I  I can tell you  That some people  That you've learned  To like a lot  Are gonna get  Hurt  Hurt  And that  And that some people  It scared me  Him just saying that  Like I'm not  I think he's not even  Talking about lost anymore  And that some people  That you thought  You'd never see again  Are gonna turn up  Uh huh  In really interesting ways 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  The  The flash forward  Aspect of the thing  Is amazing  Because  You're  It's  It's  It goes against  Every rule of television  You're giving away something  Right  You're telling the people  This person will  Get off the island  At some point  And this person's  Gonna do this  Uh  But  We don't know  The middle part  We don't know  How this happens  And that's the  The captivating part  Of the whole thing  It's really daring  I think it's a strong genius  You know  I think it will ultimately  Elevate the show  Into being something 
[01:50:00]  That's really for grown ups  You know  Really an adult theme  Because  We're gonna see that  Post island  There are no  Fairytale endings  Sort of  No one gets out alive  Or  You know  They have to deal  With the same regrets  And misgivings  And compromises  That are the truth  About real life  Now  Last night's  Episode  With  Saeed  And  You pop in there  Ending up  You know  Turn it off  If you're  You know  Not caught up yet  Spoiler alert 
[01:50:30]  Tivo  And you're  Tivo'd  You're his boss  Yeah  So what  What is their  Arrangement  What transpired  Between  You know  The  Present time  On the island  And that situation  How did we get  From here to there  Yeah  That'll be a  That'll be a story  No I'm asking you  How  Damn it  That's what sucks  I was telling  About the show  Is that it's like  Every episode  Every week  You have to live  Like the 
[01:51:00]  The Sopranos  Finale  You  You  You know  Like the show  Usually goes all year  And then the last episode  You kind of  Kind of  Hush hush  Every week  Yeah  There's not this  Last episode  Cliffhanger thing  It's every  Or last  Of the season  Finale  It's every episode  Gives you this  What the hell  When that lost  Comes up  I just  Blurred  I curse  No  No  What are you  Come on  Give me another minute  It does piss you off  Every week  I get mad  Yeah  And there aren't  There aren't many shows 
[01:51:30]  Like that  You gotta be really proud  To be on a  Successful show  Yeah  Smart  Smart writers  Yeah  And when  That first pilot episode  Which was amazing  For television  You know  That was  That was  Major motion picture  Action  Yeah  And the way it's filmed  The effects crew  On that show  Come on  Is amazing  When they showed  The plane breaking up  Over the island  It looked great  I mean it didn't look cheesy  Some great CGI  Working on that show  Those scenes where 
[01:52:00]  Parts of the fuselage  Come hurtling in  Like bullets  Yeah  Yeah  It still makes my hair  Stand on end  It gives it a  Major motion picture feel  And then  The action  In the first episode  The first pilot episode  But then it just  Takes this turn  Because you think  It's going to be  Alright it's a  Plane crash movie  Or show  I get it  And we're going to  Learn about the people  And that  Wait  Wait what  What is the smoke  Right  What is the smoke  And don't say  I don't know  Or I'll have to  Punch you in the face  You're always asked that 
[01:52:30]  What is the smoke  Do you really know  As an actor  Do you know  What that is  I don't  I'm not sure  What the smoke is  But my brother  Sent me a list  Of theories  Every morning  After the show  I get a list  Of theories  From him  And he had  A really interesting  One for the smoke  This morning  What was it  Share it  Or  Well he just  He told me  He thinks  The smoke  You remember  Those particles  That make a circle  Around Jacob's cabin 
[01:53:00]  He thinks  Those particles  When animated  When they get up  In the air  They make this cloud  That is controllable  By who  By Jacob  Excellent question  It's like  I feel like  I'm going to get  An answer  But I'm not  It's just like  In the show  Yeah  It doesn't give answers  Travis really wants  Another shot at this  Travis you got  Michael Emerson  In studio  Huge fan  I mean huge fan 
[01:53:30]  Also this is  Travis  Shut up  Go ahead  You asked some  Of the questions  That I had  But as an actor  And a fan of the show  Is there like  A specific question  About the show  That you're  Looking forward  To finding out  Like the answer to  Well  I guess it's  Just my own ego  But I'll be  I'll be really curious  To find out  Who  What Ben's  Uber mission is  What are the stakes 
[01:54:00]  And who are the players  Because it's got to be  Larger in scope  Than what we've seen  This is the tip  Of some great iceberg  I don't know  If Ben is  You know  The last defense  Of humanity  If he's the only thing  That stands between  Humankind  And annihilation  Or maybe he  Fancies himself that  I'd love to know  The answer to that question  Who's the guy  That doesn't age  The guy that brought  What's your name  Yeah the character's name  Is Richard Alpert  He's the only guy  That I've seen  That hasn't aged  Yeah he's pre-other 
[01:54:30]  Too  Yeah he's  He's older  Yeah he's the  Yeah  He was like an other  Before the others  Were there  Before the others came  And when you were a kid  He was the same age  That's right  He brought the lady  I mean now  He just has a haircut now  Yeah  He just has a haircut  That's right  And it's like  That freaks me out  It's like  Just give me a nibble  Interesting character  Isn't it  He's staring at me  Like Ben  You're creeping me out  It'd be funny  If I just went missing  No  It'd be nice  Tell you the truth  There you go 
[01:55:00]  There's one way  To look at it  Wow so  Yeah you guys  Are all  Making the rounds  I guess  And what's the arrangement  For the season  Now that  The strike's over  But I guess  There's going to be  A problem  Writing all the episodes  Well they  Yeah we used up  All the material we had  So I'm sure  Someone is writing  Furiously  Even as we speak  But it'll take them  Ten days  To have a working script  And they have to  Hire back the entire company  You know  Everyone was pink slipped  Except the actors  So they 
[01:55:30]  You know  They have to rehire  You know  Drivers and camera  And grips and greens  And all  All those people  So it'll be  Two and a half weeks  Before we can film  And we're going to shoot  An abbreviated season  Yeah that's what  I'm a little worried about  We're just going to do  Five more  But these guys  Are the masters  Of compression  And you know  Rearranging the pieces  Yeah  We needn't worry  No  Oh the  Everything you would have gotten  You will eventually get  It may just not be  All this season  They'll  You know  They'll stick it in  And how 
[01:56:00]  How much time  Do you actually spend  In Hawaii  Well previously  When we shot  Twenty three episodes  I would be there  Nine months  Out of twelve  But now it's more like  Six  Because we were  Shooting shorter seasons  What island did you  Shoot on  Oahu  Everything you see  Like last night  All those scenes in Berlin  With snow  In the streets  That was downtown Honolulu  Wow  That's with  That's with snow machines  Doing that  And there's  There's Saeed  Making snowballs  And stuff  You know  In Hawaii  In Honolulu 
[01:56:30]  Something  I like the little piece  Of business he did  On the trash can  Grabbed it  Wiped his hand  With the towel  That's actor talking  You must be psyched  As an actor though  To land this gig  Because this  Is going to be played  Forever  And the  The check  You're going to be  Getting checks for this  You're just going to  Wake up one morning  And there's going to  Be a check for like  30 grand  You'll be like  You haven't worked  In 10 years  You can see the guy  With the artistic  Integrity here  Is just talking about  The money aspect  Michael's talking about  He likes to see 
[01:57:00]  Where his character  Is going to go  And end up  Hey those checks  Are rolling in  Aren't they  That's right  Naughton  You were banging  Nails five years ago  You're on the same  Boat with me  I'll be 90  And I'll be at  The lost convention  That's got to be  Your biggest nightmare  You're going to be  The guy  At the table  Because it's  Going to last forever  You know  It's one of those  Shows that  It's one of  These groundbreaking  Legendary shows  That are just  Going to find  A place in history  Like Star Trek did  And the X-Files  And this is 
[01:57:30]  This is this  Generation's  Version of those shows  You're going to have  To wear a brown  Jumpsuit with a  Dharma logo on it  Do you remember  In episode 15  When  Okay  Get out of here  We really have to  Take a break  We're really late  Michael  Fantastic  To have you in here  It's really great  To meet you  I'm looking forward to  I mean  Any other cast members  You want to say  Hey  Open Anthony  You're very nice  And they are fans  Of the show  You come in

[01:59:30]  Cleveland Improv  Go to improv.com  And hit Cleveland Improv  For tickets  Call me crazy  But I'm very good  At the observation  Yeah  And I'm getting  The impression  That what just happened  Here in the studio  Was a pretty big deal  Yes  Michael Emerson  Being in here  Was a big deal  And he's on Lost  And he plays Ben  Yes  And I got to tell you  Something  I have never seen Lost 
[02:00:00]  Which is crazy  And I wasn't even  Going to fake it  Like  Good old Mike here  Says  I noticed you  You threw in a couple  Uh-huhs  And mmm  That's all I could do  With that interview  But  I got the box set  From the Philly crew  Last Christmas  And my brother  Took it from me  And he refuses  To give it back  See that's what it is  About the show  And that's the  God is honest truth  I keep telling them  Give me my  Effing Lost box set  Back  Because I do want  To watch the show  But I haven't yet  But didn't you  Everybody  Everybody in the room  Got a free new box set  Except for me  Wait

[02:01:00]  Emerson, Lake, and Palmer  I was googling  My ass off last night  I was googling  ELP  You googled  Wrong my friend  I'm like wow  Michael Emerson's here  Cool  No  I want to see what  Lake and Palmer  What  No  No  It's uh  He's from Lawson  I was a gushing  Ass  When we went off  The air  For commercials  I go back  Where he's signing  The lost box sets  Because it's not enough  That I had just  Spoken to him 
[02:01:30]  I have to go back  And talk to him  On a more personal level  And then I'm just  Saying stuff  About the show  And how  The ensemble cast  It's amazing  That you could have  That many people  And still have  The audience  Care about  Such a big cast  And it doesn't come off  Soap opera-ish  With such a huge cast  And he goes  He goes  That was a big concern  Of mine  I was like  Yeah  He thought the same  Thing I did  And I'm just  I'm a gushing girl  You almost kissed him  I probably would have 
[02:02:00]  You almost kissed him  Let's be honest  He's a cute guy  Not in a gay way  But in a  I appreciate  And I respect  What you do  Yes  Thank you for  Entertaining me weekly  Right  Thank God it wasn't yesterday  He would have to be  A valentine  It was too late  Can't catch him out  On the street  And then from what I hear  He was walking past  He was walking past  The other studio  And who was in there  The board op  The board op  Is in there  He's more than a board op  Jesus  Well you know  The audience doesn't care 
[02:02:30]  And Michael just kind of  Peeked in and went  What did he do  He went hello  And waved at him  And freaked him  Just freaked him out  Really  Like he could just  Do that though  To people  He could walk around  And freak people  Out  It's those eyes man  Yeah  When you were talking  To him  He doesn't blink  Sometimes he's talking  And you know  You're talking to an actor  But then he gets  Into this cadence  With his voice  And his voice will go down  And you're like  Holy crap that's Ben 
[02:03:00]  Yeah  That is absolutely the guy  So cool to meet him  And then Roland  Has to tease us  And go  Locke's gonna be  In New York next week  Maybe we could get him  I go  Don't even ask  I go  The time you're wasting  Asking us  You could be trying  To get him  You don't have to ask  For lost people  Bring them here  Let's say hi  Bring them to me  Let's say hi  To Nick in Maine  Nick  Hey what's up guys  Hey  I want to be the first  To welcome the new  Character to the show 
[02:03:30]  Opie's  Know nothing guy  You know what  I'm gonna go with that  Nick  I mean  To be honest with you  The two things  That I've been  Talking about  This morning  The chef's table  At Gordon Ramsay's  Restaurant  That's right  Yeah  And this guy  Michael something  From lost  No  Ben  No effing clue  And that's the  God's eyes truth  But you know  Because of Nick  I'm gonna develop  Know nothing guy  I love the character  I like it too  Thank you  I finally have  Something to do  On the show 
[02:04:00]  Thanks Nick  Well they say  I do nothing  You know  Because they know  How a radio show works  Yeah  They listen  And they think  They know everything  Kind of like  Watching one episode  Of lost  And you got it  All figured  Well I don't know  About that  Alright so  Exactly  That's the point  I'm making  But you know  Everything right  Blind CC  Blind CC  Copy paste  Copy paste  Print message board  Fake name  Shut up  Shut up  You dopes  You know nothing  You know maybe 
[02:04:30]  1%  1% of what goes on  On a radio show  Anyway  I hope he really  Didn't say one word  During that  You know why  There are times  I'll blow up  Someone's spot  And just fool around  With it  But I  This was  I'm not stupid  I know loss is huge  I'm not  You know  And I know Anthony  Is massively into it  I've seen him  And his chick cry  On trains  Watching episodes  No no no  My girl  She cried  You got a little teary eyed  A little bit  A little bit  A little bit  I didn't  She was crying though 
[02:05:00]  When Locke got shot  A little bit  When Locke got shot  And it looked like  He was like done  When he got thrown  In the bodies  You got emotional  No she did  Really  I was throwing old people  Out of my train seat  Believe me  He did kind of  Turn into a chatty Cathy  He really did  Bobby you were right  Behind us  It's called an interview  You douche  I know but you didn't  Want anybody else  No no  I didn't  He was mine  He was mine 
[02:05:30]  Hold on  First of all  An interview is where  You interact  With the person  You're talking to  What you did  Was kind of a monologue  Of how much  He was talking  It was like  Voss acting  First I had to let  You know here  I am glad  That you brought that up  Because when Anthony  Gets excited about someone  Anthony is a great interviewer  I'm not  I'm not going to  Bust your balls  As far as that goes  But when Anthony  Really likes somebody  That's sitting in that seat  Oh boy  It's very difficult  Bastards 
[02:06:00]  I am so glad  It came from you Bobby  Let me tell you something  It makes the guest  More relaxed  When you know  That you legitimately  Appreciate their work  And you're familiar with it  Makes everybody else  Feel uncomfortable  Like when you're  In Letterman  Oh my god  It makes the guy  Much more comfortable  When you actually  Answer his questions  For him  No I wasn't answering  I was asking him stuff  I was also trying  To bring people into it 
[02:06:30]  That might not be  Such big fans  By letting them know  That yes  Yes  Michael Emerson  Said to say  He loved you  And thank you  That is fantastic  That is great  Maybe he would have loved us  Catch him on the street  Lunch  I see me and him  Doing lunch  Yeah do you  Do you really  No I go home  He'd actually start  Dressing like him too  He'd come up with  Little round glasses  Little round glasses  Yeah  Can't be that  Intimidatingly scary 
[02:07:00]  Try to use that  To maybe you know  Get a reservation  For dinner tonight  Or something  Hey but I  Interviewed Ben  From lost  People would go  Cool how is he  Tell me about him  Not like  Not like Bob Kelly  Calling him  You pretty much  Called him a little guy  With glasses  When  When he was sitting  In the chair right there  You go you know  And you're just  You're a little guy  With glasses  Yeah  Jesus insult the guy  He is not an insult  It's a fact  I'm not intimidated  By asking the hard questions  People don't like  To have  They don't have  A self image  Of themselves like that 
[02:07:30]  I'm a little guy  With glasses  Yeah he does  Bobby  I bet he  You don't think  He read that  In the character description  Jackass  What do you really think  He thinks he works out  That's the description  He's a little  He's a psychological  Chess player  He's not a weightlifter  And you're an  Ass kissing fool  Because I  You're offended  That I made fun  Of your new girlfriend  Just because  You didn't make  A good impression  You're just jealous  You're jealous of me  You're jealous of me  I am  Because you wouldn't  Let me  You're a C blocker 
[02:08:00]  Is what you want  I wasn't  It was a little creepy  C blocking you  A little creepy  You were  Creepy  I'm a huge fan  Of the program  And his character  Is amazing  And so am I  And so is Travis  And he said  He loved me  Because you wouldn't  He only loved you  Find your own  Lost star  Bob Kelly  Let's say  Let's say hi to  Scott in New York  Scott  Jump in here  Please  Help us out  Yeah  Let me remind you  Of Anthony's  Beautiful interview  With little 
[02:08:30]  Shawnee Smith  Oh my  Okay  Look  You know what  I've been a  Shawnee Smith fan  For many years  And I was gushing  A bit with her  I gotta tell you  I thank Bob Kelly  Today because  It's something  We kind of have  Noticed over the years  But we're too scared  To bring up to Anthony  That he gets a little  Chatty when he really  Likes somebody  So now we're gonna  Have to bring some  Examples of this show  Jesus Christ  It turns into  Alright  It turns into  The view  And I'm not saying  That it's not  Good radio  It's not about that  It was great radio 
[02:09:00]  Excited  I don't even know  The show  And I was very  Interested in  The whole process  That was going on  In front of me here  But  With that said  Yeah  You're so eager  To make a connection  You're acting  No it's trying  To get out  I know we have  Limited time  So I wanna get  A lot of information  Out  And you don't want  Anybody else  Getting involved  You would've put  Curtains up around you  If you could've  I am really a douche 
[02:09:30]  Travis  Is probably  A bigger fan  Than you  I was ready  To cut him off  Oh my god  Oh wow  Bobby  You notice also  Anthony doesn't  Smile a lot  People think  I don't smile  Anthony barely smiles  He leans in a little  To listen to the answer  And he just  Kind of has this  I was looking  Into his eyes  A little smile  On his face  Most of the time  He's just a club soda  Drinking miserable ass  But today  Oh hey  Leaning over  Turned all the way around 
[02:10:00]  Yeah my back  Was completely  To open  Doesn't even acknowledge  That he's actually  Doing a radio show  With other people  I was  Exactly  I was having  A conversation  With an actor  That I respect  His work  But he was making  It sound like  I was like  You know  This must be great  Any question I had  He actually was like  You know  Trying to put  It down  Because he didn't  Want him to go  You know what  You're right  About that  Robert  Michael Emerson  Was this close  To going  I just need  To let you know  I'm not gay  I'm getting a vibe  Here  I just want  He's a married man 
[02:10:30]  But why do you  Think he said that  You mentioned that  Because you were  Weirding him out  I wasn't weirding him out  I'm a fan of the show  Conducting an interview  Fanboy  You bastard  You were staring at him  We got a fanboy  You were staring at him  Like he stares  At people in the show  You think I creeped him  Out that much  You were creeping him  Jesus Christ  And let's not forget  Ken Burns came in here  And wow  I'm a big fan  Of his documentaries  I think they're  Officially dating  I mean 
[02:11:00]  Leave me alone  I'm really a bug eyed  Fanboy  Fanboy  What is a great for me  Me and my  He said my wife  For no reason  To it  Had no reason  My wife  He did not  He did  He looked right at you  Buddy  Look at the picture  Look at the picture  Oh no  Oh no  Turn the monitor on ass  Yeah  We just say that every minute  Oh look how much  I'm smiling  I am a douche  Look at me

[02:12:00]  With all the fanboys  And he kind of looked at me  Like you know  You want a picture  You know  I'm standing here  For a couple more seconds  And I was just like  I don't really know  Who you are  You said that  See that  I didn't say it  But I kind of said it  With my eyes  Like I  That's not right  And now when I  Catch up with this loss  With the box set  I'm going to be very disappointed  I'm going to get a picture with Ben  You're going to be really mad  You're really going to have to  Oh there it is  It's up on a pal talk  Look at how happy I am  Yeah  I look like a goofy fan 
[02:12:30]  Bobby you  You  You opened the floodgates  Because now I'm just getting  Communicates from people  That want to remain anonymous  A bunch of rats  A whole family of rats  Somebody  Is reminding me  That you did the exact same thing  When Quentin Tarantino  Was in here as well  Okay  Quentin Tarantino  We are getting examples  For next week's show  I'm a huge fan  Of Quentin Tarantino  And his work  You're a chatty Cathy 
[02:13:00]  When Anthony really likes someone  And the interview is going well  And I  You know  Call me crazy  But I try to maybe  Maybe be a part of it  Sometimes he'll turn around  And look at me  With these big eyes  Like oh god  Don't ruin this for me  How dare you  Right  Don't ruin this for me  Anthony show  We'll get back to your craziness  In a while  But I'm interviewing the big star  Him and his high cheekbones  I can't stand you  You just  You really did  You're just jumping in 
[02:13:30]  You are just an FP blocker  Famous person blocker  You just want to be  The only guy in the room  You know something  I'm willing to have an open mind  And realize I could be a douche  As far as this subject goes  I might be the douche  What picture is that  Look at that  Oh my god  It looks like you're getting  Your first picture  With like your third grade teacher  Shut up  With that hot chick  Who is that  Kristen Bell from Heroes  Oh Kristen Bell  Okay yeah sure  Yeah  Another show  I haven't seen

[02:20:30]  O.B. and Anthony  O.B. and Anthony  O.B. and Anthony  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:30]  And here we are at XM Satellite Radio, the opium fanboy show.  You know, I get a bad rap.  I haven't been this excited in a while.  This is something I've wanted to say for a long time.  Oh, you don't think I felt like a nothing sitting on Letterman's couch and I talked for 30 seconds? 
[02:24:00]  Hey.  Bob Kelly finally brought up the fact that Anthony, when he gets a little nervous because he's a little excited about the person he's talking to, gets a little chatty.  A little chatty.  I just chat a little.  I saw that Letterman.  I was like, shut up.  No.  Let him talk.  Now, now you're going too far.  Now you're messing with my Irish brother here.  Now we're both going to have to beat you up.  He's Italian.  Well, you know what I mean.  The Irish, though.  They're known for that. 
[02:24:30]  He's Italian.  They beat the shit out of each other.  But as soon as you mess with one of them, then they joined forces and kicked the shit out of the stranger.  Which you are.  La, la, la, la, la.  And Dave.  And then.  And then Dave.  And then Dave.  And then Dave.  Oh, you are a douche.  Paul B had his feet dangling off the couch, twiddling his thoughts.  I was like, la, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  No, I don't.  Hey, it took the pressure off me.  I still get the credit for being on Letterman, so I don't give a shit.  He did look like the cool one.  You were the man in the relationship that night.  I was just kind of. 
[02:25:00]  You know what?  We're trying to keep this fun, Bob.  It's a man.  No, we're obviously referring to the interview with, I've already forgot his name, Michael Emerson.  I've got to think Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  That's right.  Ben from Lost was on the other side of the show, if you're just tuning in.  And Anthony was a bit excited, and Bobby finally brought it to everyone's attention.  Something that I think a lot of people have picked up on over the last few years.  Well, you know.  Anthony asks questions and also answers them at the same time. 
[02:25:30]  I do not.  And the key is, at the same time.  He's pretty much answering the question he's asking.  No.  Travis was all excited.  He turns his back to us.  All of a sudden, he's inside the actor's studio.  He actually wanted to go to the couch and sit next to him and interview him that way.  I'm getting a bad rap. 
[02:26:00]  It was a good interview, obviously.  But now I've got to, I guess, kind of jump in the barrel myself, because someone writes  on the Instant Feedback.  We don't have it printed out?  Yes, right here.  Somebody brings it to my attention, this guy from his cell phone.  If you have Instant Feedback from a cell phone and you want credit, you've got to write your name somewhere.  He writes, and why doesn't Opie do more interviews?  Two words.  Ed Asner. 
[02:26:30]  Ah, thank you.  And see, that's my problem.  That's when I was out of the loop.  I was playing poker in a tournament, and Ed Asner was brought over as a guest when I wasn't there.  And it was, all you could call it was complete anarchy at the table with poor old Ed Asner in the middle of it.  We had me, we had Joe Rogan.  He was like Reginald Denny at that intersection.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had, uh... 
[02:27:00]  Have you heard the Ed Asner clip?  No.  Oh, my God.  Do we have a short version of this?  It's two minutes.  It's two minutes?  Yeah, we could...  It's excellent, please.  We could kill two minutes.  That's easy.  Yes, well, it was a poker tournament in L.A.  And I had to do the show by myself.  And, uh...  I mean, not by myself without Anthony.  Oh, there was, uh...  Jimmy...  Was Jimmy there?  Jimmy was there.  Yeah, Jimmy was there.  And, uh, Joe Rogan and Ben...  Yeah, Rogan.  And Ben laughing like an idiot.  And I have to now sit down with the great Ed Asner.  And it was kind of a boring interview, so I just kind of... 
[02:27:30]  Had to tell him it was.  He pulled the switch.  Oh, yeah.  The switch flipped in his head.  We have different styles as far as interviewing.  Different interviewing styles.  Anthony gets that.  Which I call making the guest comfortable.  And I like to make him uncomfortable because I didn't do my research on the person we're interviewing.  So this is my MO.  Here's the Ed Asner interview.  Part of it.  You're trying to get rid of me? 
[02:28:00]  Yes, sort of.  What are you doing, Ben?  Ben, what are you doing?  Ben, what are you doing?  Sign language.  What's his sign language?  Ed, that's Ben.  He's our producer.  And he decides when a guest is getting a little too boring, and that was the sign that he usually gives.  More disrespect to Ed Asner.  We're having a good interview with Ed Asner.  I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  No, that was, yeah, Ben.  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again. 
[02:28:30]  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  But be sure that he's not in there.  He does this all the time.  I'm a big fan.  We're very happy to have you on the show.  He is a destroyer.  He's a destroyer.  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He builds nothing.  He liquidates.  He's filthy.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts.  He's a Svengali.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts. 
[02:29:00]  Ed Asner.  Bravo.  The great Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Where's Norton going and where's Voss going?  Oh, you're getting photos and stuff?  All right.  Everyone is getting pictures with Ed Asner.  Dude, you went after Ed Asner.  I didn't go after him.  Oh, my God.  You so hurt him.  We were just so fun.  I think he was really upset.  I guess he didn't really get our sense of humor.  No.  The goof.  It's hard for people to get the goof, dude.  Actually, he's a legend.  I loved Mary Tyler more growing up. 
[02:29:30]  A lot of the old guys don't get the goof.  They don't want to.  They're like, come on.  But I can't be something of that.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer.  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  It was phenomenal.  Hey, Jimmy.  Get back here, man.  I started sweating.  No, come on.  Give me a handshake, please.  Fuck you, he said.  No, fuck you.  Dude, Ed Asner just said, fuck you. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, that's phenomenal.  We're back live.  So maybe that's why I don't do many.  Take the helmet.  I like how he was blaming me.  Right.  Anthony.  I'm like, no.  That's Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan was playing the part of Anthony.  He would have told you to shut up.  Yes.  What a mess of a show.  I would have shut up.  We go all the way out to LA.  And Anthony's not even doing the radio show because he's playing poker.  And Joe Rogan is making believe he's Anthony.  Ed Asner doesn't know what the fuck's going on.  Just another day doing the show. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  That's just a great name for Opie.  The Destroyer.  I know.  He's just the Destroyer.  The Destroyer of everything that is holy.  The guy had you pegged.  And then I was like, all right, well, shake my hand.  He goes, fuck you.  Just fuck you.  Probably hasn't sworn in like 18 years.  He finally just let a nice fuck you out.  All right.  So we're reminded of that today.  Yeah.  Thanks.  So what would you rather have?  A chatty Cathy or the Destroyer? 
[02:31:00]  The Destroyer.  I looked at that as a compliment.  I like that.  Jesus.  You call a guy boring.  That guy's a legend in the business.  It's like, the thing is, the way it led up.  It was like, well, our producer is telling us.  And usually it's our producers telling us, you know, we're out of time or this.  Our producer is telling us the interview is boring.  It's like, wait a minute.  He loves breaking the fourth wall down.  Oh, he blames the producer.  He doesn't blame himself, but he blurts it out. 
[02:31:30]  He's like Bruce Willis in Moonlighting.  He just looks at the camera.  Yeah.  Can I?  Yeah.  That's where we got our breakdown, the eighth wall.  That's from it, by the way.  No, but to take you inside that, like, the interview was going nowhere.  And Ben was, it really wasn't, because I just didn't do my research.  Well, especially out there.  You didn't know who was going to all of a sudden be in front of you.  Like, oh, fuck, Ed Asner.  And then you start thinking, what the fuck can I, whatever.  And Ben was, like, giving sign language, because he was, like, trying to tell us something. 
[02:32:00]  Like, I forgot.  Like, another guest is standing by.  Or Anthony's doing really good in poker.  He was doing something.  I'm like, oh.  Having a seizure.  Right.  And I'm like, this is my fucking out.  Get out.  Yeah, he did call me a fucking wasp as well.  He called you a wasp?  Yeah, that's just the short version.  Fucking wasp.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Why can't you get fired for calling somebody a fucking wasp?  No kidding.  Are we getting the great Ronnie B on the phone? 
[02:32:30]  I hope so.  Because we got rolling in studio.  Now we got to reset this for people that are just tuning in.  But for Valentine's Day, Don Wicklin invited me and my girl and Ronnie B and his wife and, of course, Don Wicklin's wife to dinner last night for Valentine's Day, which I thought was really weird.  And he kept emailing me.  He's like, come on, you can check this off your list, whatever that means.  I guess he was like referring to the bucket list or something.  Things you should do before you die.  Because you can check this one off. 
[02:33:00]  And then he started saying that we were going to sit at something called the chef's table.  The chef's table, right?  And I didn't even know.  I swear to God, I had no clue what that meant.  Really had no idea.  And then he said it's going to be at some restaurant called the London Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, I guess.  Yeah.  Chef's table.  Gordon Ramsay.  And a little thing about Don.  Maybe we get Don on the phone, too, because he was very excited because he went to culinary school.  And I'm like, all right, whatever. 
[02:33:30]  Did he?  And then we get to the restaurant.  And the restaurant was beautiful, like five star, ridiculous.  And I'm like, wow.  Because he made us wear suits and stuff, which I didn't want to wear.  And all of a sudden, we go through these doors.  And now we're in this crazy VIP room, which is even nicer than the restaurant itself, which I thought would be impossible because it was beautiful.  And then we go through another set of doors.  And now we're in some kind of like hallway.  And now we're in the kitchen.  I'm like, wow, I guess we have to walk through the kitchen to get to that real, real special area. 
[02:34:00]  But no, they sat us at a table right next to the chefs as they're cooking in this really nice booth.  And I still didn't understand how great this was.  And Roland is actually mad at me now.  Well, it's like an honor, though, because it's Chef Ramsay.  He creates the food.  Gordon Ramsay, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Chef Ramsay.  I thought you said Jeff Ramsay.  No, Chef Ramsay.  I thought it was Jeff Ramsay from Animal Planet.  Right.  He has Michelin stars.  He's huge.  Right.  And then there was course after course after course after course after course after course. 
[02:34:30]  And I don't know.  I thought the food was really good.  No, but the chef's table, they'll say, what do you like?  And if you're like, I like this certain moose, he'll create it for you.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  I got all that.  Did you cook with him, though?  I didn't want to.  Huh.  It's like the honor.  And I said it earlier, Gordon Ramsay wasn't actually cooking.  It's his joint, and I guess he was in the area or something, but it was some other chef.  But his sous, I mean, the guy is huge, too. 
[02:35:00]  His right-hand man.  He's on the F-word show.  Oh, really?  He's phenomenal, yeah.  Yeah, the sous chef is unbelievable.  So when I, after the meal, like, had a moment with him and said, you know, I'm a restaurant  owner, my brother, he's a great chef, that was probably bad, right?  He was probably going, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Really?  Yeah, because it's like.  Oh.  So I shouldn't compare any restaurant to the restaurant I was in?  No, because he's a Michelin.  Yeah, you can't.  What's a Michelin?  I got Michelin tires.  Who gives a shit?  You can't compare a chicken pot pie. 
[02:35:30]  Are you making fun of my, are you insane?  You've never eaten at my brother's restaurant.  No, I'm not saying it's bad.  It does a little better than a chicken pot pie, man, Mr. Bob Kelly.  Did they have that thing?  Oh, no.  It's just their training, though.  It's, like, intense.  Right.  Like, they go to the indigenous regions.  Like, his chef wanted to learn Italian food.  He stayed in Sicily for, like, two years.  Two years?  Did you get that done in a month?  Two months?  No.  Delivery.  Right.  At a pizza joint.  His background is just insane, his whole background.  But two years, after a week or two, you're like, all right, I get it.  It's basil, oregano. 
[02:36:00]  Is that the official story?  He had to go to Sicily for two years to study cooking?  Or do you pull a Michael Corleone and shoot a cop?  No, just he started as a teenager to go through.  But it's insane, his background.  Let's get the great Ronnie B on the phone.  Yes.  I bow to this man.  It's Ron Bennington from the Ron and Fez Show.  Ronnie.  What do you say, buddy?  Well, I don't know.  I think we were kind of in the same boat.  I'm starting to get the impression that last night was a really big deal.  We were living large, my friend. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  We were living like Jackie Gleason there for a little while.  Jackie Gleason.  Yeah.  Nice.  I show up in my suit.  Ronnie's in his.  We're looking at each other like, all right, what is this?  It was so great to see the old confirmation suit.  It's been so many years.  Yeah, I look pretty awkward in the suit.  But so we found $10 in his pocket for his grandmother.  Yeah.  And she's been dead for seven years.  I miss her.  But anyway, so what do you think, Ronnie? 
[02:37:00]  Ten courses.  We had like pre-dessert appetizers.  We had appetizer desserts even.  And then we had something after dessert.  We were living like Romans.  It was literally a Roman origin.  And I never ate so much while I was jerking off.  Yeah, it's good stuff.  We lost count.  Seriously.  In the kitchen.  I think officially it was an eight-course meal.  But there were things they were serving that they didn't want to count as courses.  Right, Ronnie? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, there was a cheese plate that came in three and a half hours into this thing.  No joke.  We were there four hours.  Four hours to eat dinner.  Four hours with Don Wicklin.  It's an experience.  That's what Roland's saying.  And I got to apologize to Ronnie and his wife.  It's Valentine's Day and I'm just talking Ronnie's ear off.  I know I was talking a little too much.  But I was uncomfortable to be in the booth with Don Wicklin.  And every once in a while I would like turn and like ask him some question I didn't really  need the answer to.  And then I would go back to Ronnie and we'd talk radio and this and that. 
[02:38:00]  On Valentine's Day.  On Valentine's Day, right.  Yeah, Wiggy was so excited and then he got to put on a little apron and go cook to everybody.  It was like being at a kid's party where the birthday boy gets to ride a pony.  It was like you went to build a bear.  Yeah, we built a bear of food.  Of food where the kid gets to get up and build his own bear.  The guy's like, would you like to cook?  I go, what the fuck do you think? 
[02:38:30]  I'm going to go over and cook with everybody?  I've been to a salad bar before.  I'm not impressed with it.  Thank you, Ronnie.  Thank you.  Because I've been getting shit all morning that I should have been more impressed.  I don't know.  Maybe if I went to culinary school I would get what's going on.  It looked impressive.  They put food in molds.  Great.  Were they sauteing?  They had a sautier, I believe his name is, right?  Well, I know that from Ratatouille.  Ratatouille.  Ratatouille or whatever, right.  Here's the thing.  The food was amazing, but we're in the kitchen, so it's hot as piss back. 
[02:39:00]  Thank you.  One more for me.  The kitchen doesn't seem like the place to be to eat.  You don't even want the chair near the kitchen door.  I was bitching and Ronnie was bitching.  We took our jackets off immediately.  The sweat is just forming on our foreheads.  It was so hot.  You know, it's like when you eat good food, but in the kitchen, you're a fucking bus boy.  That's what they do.  They have to pick at it as they're running in and out. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're eating with the border crossers, and I'm like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Me and Ronnie are looking like the portions.  They were a little small, huh, Ronnie?  They were a little tiny, but they went on forever, bro.  Forever.  Yeah.  Stuff you felt guilty that you were going to eat, because it looked just way too pretty.  Who was the waiter?  Was it the actual chef?  I guess.  Yeah, the chef brings it over to you.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  That's where it's from.  And then he shows you the raw materials.  Yeah.  He's showing us like a lemon from India.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  That looked like an octopus head.  That's the only way to describe it.  But Bob Kelly's in studio today, too, Ronnie, and he's mad as well.  I'm sorry.  We don't know this culture crap.  Yeah, but it's like, you know, I mean, maybe because you guys get a lot of stuff or whatever,  but like, you know, if somebody took me to a five-star restaurant for nothing, I'd be  like, I don't have to pick up the check.  And it's like half.  I'd be excited about that.  And if they took me to another portion of the thing, and then it's Gordon Ramsay.  Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.  He has four TV shows.  Oh, great.  It's a five-star restaurant. 
[02:40:30]  That's terrific.  But take me out of the kitchen, put the TV show up on the screen.  Yeah, it was hot as balls in there.  And these guys are trying to make me understand how great this was last night.  I mean, this analogy hasn't come in yet, but they're basically saying it's like watching  the Rolling Stones kind of work out satisfaction in front of you.  Yeah, I know, but don't sit me too close to the amplifier.  Exactly.  It hurts your ears.  Exactly. 
[02:41:00]  There was a really beautiful restaurant that we missed out on.  Fucking Ron had me dying, man, because, I mean, the food is coming out.  He's like, holy shit, we're three and a half hours into this, and now a cheese plate.  And then he made some kind of Coke analogy that was brilliant.  What was the Coke analogy again, Ronnie?  Basically, it's like when you're on a 12-hour Coke run, where you don't want to give it up  anymore, but you know the next bump could kill you.  All that excitement factor was going on for us.  Oh, God damn it. 
[02:41:30]  You can't really refuse anything, either.  You can't just say nothing.  You can't turn it down.  And like you said, if somebody else bought the Coke, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  And, you know, I really, especially at first, no joke, I'm not trying to play this up for  the radio.  I had no clue how unbelievable this experience was going to be, okay?  So the waiter, the first waiter, we had probably 10.  Well, no, we had about, how many waiters?  Probably three or four waiters, and then we had probably 10 chefs that stopped by the table.  They all have a specialty in this restaurant, right? 
[02:42:00]  And I felt like such an ass, because the waiter goes, anyone have allergies here?  And my girl just starts rattling off everything I'm allergic to, and then I...  Was she a monk?  And then, of course, I have to start with the jokes, like, yeah, also allergic to dust mites  and grass.  I don't think they're cooking with that.  No, they didn't, yeah, they didn't get the joke, but...  It was the captain, though.  That's the head waiter.  Oh.  Oh, the captain?  Yeah, he's the one that goes in the kitchen for the chefs.  Yeah, he looked a little more special than the rest of them, so... 
[02:42:30]  I don't know.  It was great.  It was...  And Wicklin just wanted, like, me to go, wow, Don, thank you.  He wanted your love.  Like, all he's ever wanted was your love.  Yeah, and then...  Oh, yeah.  And then Ronnie's turning into a therapist, trying to have me and Don work out our differences  in front of this, like, amazing situation.  It's just a story of unrequited love between Opie and Wicklin.  Like, Wickie is just taken.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  And Opie, not so much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Ronnie, you know, because he's been in the business a long time, like we have,  and Ronnie and I all of a sudden, like, started looking at each other.  We're, like, getting very suspicious.  We're like, what is this going to cost us in the end?  And it wasn't...  Whatever.  Money?  Who gives a shit?  Throw the money on the table.  But we're talking, what is this going to cost us in the end?  In the long run, yeah.  Are we going to have to deliver a kilo to somebody?  Are we going to have to be, you know, promoting trips to the Dominican Republic?  There was going to be some kind of something going on. 
[02:43:30]  A little plug-ole type of thing, right?  Right, Ron?  It was always the, we're making some changes dinner.  I don't know what he's doing on that.  We're restructuring some things.  Yeah, by the end of it, though, I certainly appreciated what was happening in front of us,  but I didn't know going into it.  I really didn't.  Did you, Ron?  Yeah, I did.  You did understand?  Yeah.  I mean, the place is incredibly famous.  He's a very famous guy. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Ron's a man of the world, too.  Yeah, he certainly is.  He's got a definitely more culture.  I don't know what Wickey spent.  What the hell did he drop to get that table?  On Valentine's Day.  On Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day, yeah.  I just thought that, you know, they kind of overbooked, and that was the last table they had available.  And literally, he's like, he's handing roses to our chicks and stuff.  Oof.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And we try to pay, because we're like, all right, because I know Don.  Don will take a bullet for, the fact is he'll take a bullet for any of us, and he'll, like, 
[02:44:30]  he'll, like, just max out credit cards just to try to get us to love him and stuff.  So I'm thinking, how much money is this costing?  And he's not taking a dollar.  Not a one.  He's probably going to expense it and hope it gets lost in this merger.  Oh, by the way, we weren't supposed to talk about this on the radio, because he kind of was hiding this from Elo.  I just remember that.  Holy shit, I just remember that.  Yeah, so thanks to Elo.  We had a great time.  Thank you.  Because he goes, please don't tell Elo.  Oh, shit. 
[02:45:00]  And I'm not even joking.  We were supposed to keep this on the QT.  But I'm thinking to myself, this is going to make for some good radio the next day.  Someone's got to go under the bus.  It's got to be Wickland.  He's got some secret deals going on behind Logan's back.  That was the dinner that stopped a merger.  Right.  I mean, it's expensive.  Yeah, a lot of people are commenting.  Why wasn't I invited?  Because we've...  No, it's not interesting.  Actually, it's gotten to the point where people just don't invite you anymore, because you say no all the time. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  You really just never...  I say no to burgers at the Parker Meridian.  I say no to another chicken pop pie at the Brooklyn Diner.  It's not burgers at the Meridian.  It's burgers with our staff that works hard behind the scenes.  I've taken these sons of bitches for burgers at the Parker Meridian.  I understand that.  I don't want to think that you're taking the sons of bitches for burgers.  What?  They would like to think you're thinking about them. 
[02:46:00]  I've taken them many places.  I've taken them to Rue.  But when you call them sons of bitches...  They are sons of bitches.  Just the price we have to pay.  If you could teleport back to Long Island right at 11 o'clock, you would.  You're just gone.  Why wouldn't I?  You're just gone.  If that was possible, why would...  If I could teleport, why wouldn't I?  But you never hang out.  That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  You never hang out.  You just leave.  You just go.  No, I would hang out for as long as the commute would take me, and then I'd teleport.  It would save me all that time. 
[02:46:30]  My point is, you should hang out a little more.  Have some breakfast one day.  You don't hang out.  It's always about food with you.  Oh, you're going to be...  Have a breakfast.  Ron and I were thinking...  You'll never fit in the teleport machine.  You're fucking...  That's the way you'll lose weight.  Your love handles will drop to the floor where you left, and you'll be a cylinder-shaped  corpse.  That's how the transport...  Ron and I were thinking, could you imagine what kind of omelet this place would make?  And I think that made Don's eyes roll, too.  But just imagine what kind of omelet this guy would roll out for you.  My God. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, is the uncomfortability over?  Are we finally back to...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Listening to you guys makes me feel like I need to call my parents.  I need to cry.  I'm sure Fez is at home crying right now.  Oh, yeah.  The Fez angle.  Oh, fuck, Ron.  You're...  This guy is one of the funniest guys on the planet.  Because he was explaining why Fez didn't make it.  Because I guess Fez did get the big invite.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Fez got the invite, and he couldn't go because he had Sundowner's disease. 
[02:47:30]  Where he's afraid to be out after dark.  I've heard about his Sundowner's disease.  When did this perk up on him?  This is the truth, by the way.  He's basically...  I think this is what happened.  He lives his life like I am legend.  Where he thinks when the sun comes down, the zombies come out.  So, Ronnie goes, well, Fez, just wear a Miner's helmet.  A Miner's helmet. 
[02:48:00]  It would brighten things up.  What?  Just live in perfect safety with your fucking Miner's helmet.  He goes, just walk around at night with a Miner's helmet on.  Sundowners.  And then I'm like, Ron, I have to know, man.  I just have to know.  You've been to Fez's joint.  Like, what does it look like?  And what did you say?  I said it looks like a four-year-old with a credit card. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, shit.  Fucking cartoons on the walls and shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah, that's exactly what I pictured.  So, I'm sure Ronnie's going to have his own take from noon at three today, obviously.  But we've been having fun with it today there, Ron.  Well, it was a great night.  It was.  The conversation was terrific.  The ladies looked wonderful.  The food was amazing.  Could have been a little further away from the fire. 
[02:49:00]  That's all.  It was almost perfect, Wickie.  Too bad.  And I admitted a lot of things to Ron last night.  Ron has a way of making you talk.  I'm like, why am I telling him?  I'm very open.  This is not smart.  We were unmasked.  We were unmasked.  Unmasked, Alfie.  Yeah, I think you got me unmasked a little bit last night.  And I basically admitted to everyone, yeah, I know I'm an ass, but I'm working on it.  My chick has certainly made me a lot better.  I got a ways to go.  But I just remember something else.  So, we walk into...  Nervously laughs in agreement. 
[02:49:30]  He just...  I hope to go before you sleep, big man.  He just left himself an out.  No, I got one other thing that I forgot.  So, I walk in, and Don has the excitement on his face that we all agree to come together  so he could really show us an amazing thing that we'll talk about this to our grandkids  someday.  That old gag, right?  So, I walk in, and Don's like, you want a drink?  You want a drink?  And I'm like, yeah, I'll enjoy...  It's a school night, but I'll enjoy a nice glass of Cabernet. 
[02:50:00]  So, he runs to the bar to get me a drink.  He wants me to feel comfortable right away.  He wants this night to be perfect.  So, God, this makes me look like an idiot.  Anyway, he gives me the glass of Cabernet, and I'm kind of a wine snob.  So, I take a little sip of Cabernet, and without even a hint of sarcasm or humor, I go, wow, 
[02:50:30]  did you just get me the house red?  What did he do?  Did his eyes open up?  His face dropped.  He was like, oh.  He just got all upset.  Just wants to please.  Want to please Opie.  So, then I made him buy, I think, a pretty solid bottle when we finally sat down at the  table, just so I could have one glass.  And then I kind of slid the glass he did give me at the bar, kind of, to the waiters.  Oh, so you absolutely meant it.  Yeah, that's what I'm getting at. 
[02:51:00]  That's why it's really awful that I admit this stuff, because it doesn't help the image.  Yeah, and Don was...  He melded like a candle, the poor thing.  Yeah, he was just...  He was like Frosty the Snowman.  Everything just left him.  Yeah.  No, but thanks to Don Wicklund, thanks to Ronnie B and his lovely wife, and Don's lovely wife.  We had a great time last night.  Maybe Ann will come out sometime.  I don't know.  Well, now this is going to cause a problem, because Anthony didn't get the invite, but I 
[02:51:30]  don't know.  Well, you guys out drinking champagne, champagne cocktails.  I'm home.  But be honest, you wouldn't have gone.  I might have.  You wanted the invite.  I understand that.  It doesn't matter.  What'd you do last night?  I don't think you would have...  Mickey knows.  What'd you do for Valentine's Day?  Valentine's Day, Call of Duty.  I spent it with the gay team, playing with the gays, which is Bobby's clan, on Call of Duty. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  With an icy cold Guinness.  Yeah.  It was nice.  Well, Ron, Ant had a great show today, because he was fanboy all the way.  We had Ben from Lost in today.  You know, Ben from Lost was in, and that's huge.  Did you just do a line, Ronnie?  What the hell?  Let's do a quick one.  Oh, my God.  Quick one.  You know what?  I call it a little morning cappuccino. 
[02:52:30]  I can get the day started.  Froth that shit up and put it on your espresso, right, Ronnie?  All right.  So Ben from Lost was in, huh?  Yeah.  So, you know, I'm a huge fan of the show, and I get a little excited when guests are in like that.  And I like asking questions and talking to the gentleman.  And then they call me fanboy.  Well, it disappoints me.  You had the opportunity to kill him, and you didn't do it. 
[02:53:00]  Damn it, Locke.  You had the chance to kill him.  Yeah.  And they don't got the episodes written or produced yet, so they would have had to kill him off if you actually killed him in real life.  And you know the press we would have gotten?  Hell yeah.  Oh, Coach.  You would have been a god to those people.  Wow.  Yeah.  They'd put me on the website and tried to enlarge pictures of my hat to see what's written on it.  Fucking geeks.  The other thing, man, we talked about Earl probably one out of the four hours. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  We had at least an hour of material on Earl at dinner last night.  Well, Earl's dad was one of the busboys.  It was great to see him.  Jesus.  Shine my shoes in between horses.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  We were playing Top This with Earl Stories.  Ronnie started, and then I tried to top, and then he's topping me, and then I'm trying to top.  It was just endless.  For years.  Endless.  You could go forever.  We're going to have to have a Ron, a Ron. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, well, a Ron and Fez, Opie and Anthony, Top This Earl Show.  Yeah, I'd love to.  Because I'm getting all the new Earl stories that are just amazing.  Amazing.  I listened on Worst of the other day, maybe last week or so, and it was Earl's picture hanging episode.  Yeah.  Where it took him four hours to hang six pictures.  I hung all six pictures in the time of a commercial break with time left over.  Oh, that's how that ended?  Yeah, and he couldn't fathom how that happened or why he had excuses, and then he just did what Earl always does. 
[02:54:30]  Gets really mad and storms off and says, fuck you.  Takes a half a day.  Takes a half a day off.  Yeah, takes a half a day.  He just leaves at will.  Oh, he learned a very valuable radio lesson, though, because we've all done it.  You know, the phones don't work.  You know what?  Until these phones are fixed, I'm not broadcasting anymore.  You did 15 minutes of radio.  You just figure out ways to take the day off, and no one's going to question you.  Ron, you know, you've got to at least give Earl credit for figuring out that. 
[02:55:00]  I'll tell you the truth about Earl.  He's going to bury us all like he did Muni.  Yeah, right?  Oh, yeah.  I remember with Ken Stevens, we were having our problems with Howard back in the day, right?  And word came down that, you know, they didn't want us talking about Howard or something like that.  And Ken has given us this big news in his office, right?  And all of a sudden, dead seriously, I just didn't want to work that day.  I just didn't feel like doing radio.  So I go to Ken.  I remember this one, yeah.  You remember this, right?  I go, Ken, you know what? 
[02:55:30]  I hear what you're saying with the Howard stuff, and we're on the same team.  I've got to be honest with you, man.  I'm having a tough time with this.  I don't think we can leave it alone.  I go, I really don't think we'll be able to leave this alone.  And you know what?  Let's be responsible for once.  I really think we should take the day off and let this just kind of settle in, and we'll  start over tomorrow.  And Ken is like, oh, this is a great idea.  Great.  Yeah, I like this.  I like this.  All right.  You guys are okay.  Take the day off.  He's like, you're okay with taking a day off? 
[02:56:00]  You got worst of and stuff?  I'm like, I see two weeks as being a little hard.  And I really need to unwind down in Atlantis.  And we walk out of Ken's office, and Ant looks at me basically and goes, that was smooth,  man.  I'm like, we're out.  Let's enjoy our day off, man.  That was the only reason.  We were just fishing for a fucking day off, and he bought it hook, line, and sinker.  Yeah, you can do that in this business for some reason.  Mr. Bennington.  All right, boys.  Noon to three.  Yes.  The Ron and Fez show. 
[02:56:30]  Yep.  Tune in.  Everyone does.  Everyone does.  Hey, I was telling the guys, by the way, I'm just about ready to shit the first five courses  out.  My stomach is a-bubbling.  Give me that percolating.  I'm going to take care of the first five, and hopefully after the show, the second five.  It's going to look like an Indian lemon.  Dude, the cholesterol.  Holy shit.  I saw Wickey go up and throw up like a bulimic as soon as we left the place.  He's way out in front of us all.  That would have been hilarious. 
[02:57:00]  All right.  See you later, boys.  Everyone's getting nervous.  We got Michael Madsen.  He's been standing by for like 15 minutes.  Ron, thank you so much.  All right.  Take care.  Obviously, Ron, from Ron and Fez, noon to three, like Ann said, here on 202.  Let's do a very quick break.  Very quick break.  Regroup, and we'll get Michael Madsen in here, who was early.  I apologize to Michael in advance, but we'll get to him in a second here.  Oh, hey.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:57:30]  Hey.  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here?  Awful.  Awful.  They're just awful.  Awful people.  Holy shit, we're going to get along with Michael Madsen. 
[02:58:00]  I'll tell you right now, man.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show, Bob Kelly in studio, and the great Michael Madsen.  Yeah.  Who just told us that he hasn't been in New York in five years.  And he's thanking us right off the bat, because he got a free trip to New York because of  our radio show.  That's a pretty good deal, as far as I'm concerned.  It's kind of cold outside, but, you know, it beats the hell out of L.A. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  You've been in L.A. for how long?  When I have to be there, back and forth, for about 14, 15 years now.  Oh, shit.  But you've been traveling, you were saying.  I've been all over the world.  I've been Ireland and Bulgaria, Moscow.  What the hell is it doing, Bulgaria?  I don't know where Bulgaria is.  It's called employment signs.  I have to go where I need to go. 
[02:59:00]  I'm more popular in foreign countries than I am in my own, so.  Is that the truth?  Come on.  It seems that way.  It's a little rough getting work nowadays.  Why the fuck is that?  A lot of competition in Hollywood, you know.  Michael Madsen, for fuck's sake.  You know, the guy with the towel.  He always does a scene with a towel on.  I'm up against him, you know.  And the other one, the Scientologist.  And, you know, the rest of them. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, good Lord, you know, make some room for Daddy.  But they're not very gracious about that.  Believe me.  No?  I mean, you know.  They drive past me in the street with my legs amputated to get to a meeting with Bruce Willis.  You know?  You know?  Oh, get it all out, Michael.  Come on.  Let's get it out.  Let's get it out.  Then I meet Bruce on Sin City.  And he starts telling me about all these projects we're going to do together. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  I'm like, yeah, that sounds pretty good, Bruce.  Yeah.  Thanks for looking after me.  Meanwhile, you know, a couple years later.  You're going to Bulgaria.  I see him at Astronaut Farmer premiere.  I'm like, hey, man.  Remember all those projects you told me about?  He's like, what?  What projects?  Yeah.  You know.  What about the last Die Hard?  You could have been in that one.  Oh, wouldn't that have been wonderful?  That would have really given my career a boost. 
[03:00:30]  I would have been the guy that he threw out the window.  In this scene, you light a cigarette, you fire a gun, and Bruce kicks you down a flight  of stairs.  No thanks, fellas.  I'd rather pump gas.  Wow.  By the way, we're all huge fans of what you have done.  Oh, yeah.  And I just didn't expect this angle, and I'm loving it. 
[03:01:00]  No, it's not an angle.  It's not an angle.  I understand.  I understand.  It's the business end of the business blows.  It just blows.  It blows.  People really knew what goes on behind the closed doors.  Not to try to relate to a great actor like yourself, but I mean, just doing radio, the  bullshit we have to deal with.  You're like, fuck you.  You think it's all fun and games, and then behind the scenes, everything sucks, and management  are assholes and everything, and it's got to be the same way in movies.  They ruin, as far as where we sit, the greatest job you could have. 
[03:01:30]  It's like, how do you ruin the greatest job you could have?  Goofing on shit.  I was listening to you guys in the other room, and I went, which one of you got to take a  shit?  I do.  I just thought that was amazing.  I never heard of a radio show.  All the other words is, fuck this and fuck that.  That motherfucker, I got to take a shit, you know?  Holy shit.  And you're sitting there, and this is why I'm sitting on these bleachers waiting to get  in there so they can talk about the shit they have to take. 
[03:02:00]  Great.  We like to call it an open and honest show.  Yeah.  I took a good shit before I left the hotel.  Did you?  Yeah.  Nice.  It does make you feel good.  It did.  It's like a great way to wake up in the morning.  Oh, God, yeah.  So I think I'm reading you.  I'm ready for the day.  I'm hearing you.  I'm ready to load up again.  I'm getting the feeling that you-  Jesus, this is so not what I expected.  No shit, man.  I love it.  We got you out there with Ben from Lost. 
[03:02:30]  Very actor-y, very formal.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure, yeah.  Another exciting show.  What will happen next?  Someone will get lost.  Oh, God in heaven.  I ought to bring a camera crew over to my fucking house.  They want to make a reality show, I can tell you.  Oh, shit.  One more thing than that shit.  Michael's been-  I can kind of sense-  Don't even ask him.  Michael's been through the mill as far as Hollywood goes. 
[03:03:00]  And a lot of people hide this stuff, but there are a bunch of assholes over there.  I mean, it's just the way it is.  Oh, there's a lot of them that are nice, and I've had some great times.  I've made some good pictures.  I've been very lucky.  Oh, hell yeah.  But, you know, 85% of it is horse shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's-  It's too hard to-  It's-  I get more work on my own than I do by, you know, playing the normal game of getting work.  Really?  I've run into people at a party somewhere and get a script or meet somebody that wants 
[03:03:30]  to do something, and-  You just scare the shit out of them.  You can make it.  You're like, all right, I'll put you in a movie.  Jesus.  Well, they have to take it to get in the elevator with me, but-  Does it amaze you sometimes when you look at the top-grossing movie of the week and go,  like, what the fuck is this country thinking?  Yeah, I kind of get that feeling, especially with some of the pictures that are nominated right  now.  Yeah.  It's very bewildering to me.  Like what?  Which one in particular?  Oh, well, you see, the thing is, is if I start naming certain titles, those people will 
[03:04:00]  never hire me again.  Not that they would anyway, but I am a bit mystified by some of the things that seem to  be, that get an enormous amount of attention in box office.  It's amazing to me.  Yeah, I don't know where, because I'll look at a trailer on TV or in the movie theater  and say, there is no way I'll ever see this movie.  I have no interest in seeing it.  And then it's, you know, number one, number two, and you go, who the fuck, who saw this? 
[03:04:30]  You don't like Fool's Gold?  What?  What?  Is that a movie?  We're just a bunch of lemmings out there, because Fool's Gold is getting the worst ratings,  like as, you know, reviews, whatever.  And it was number one at the box office.  I'm like, does anyone read?  No.  Is there a scene in there where he wears a towel?  A towel.  There's got to be one, right?  With the big knot in the front.  And his hair's wet?  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, my... 
[03:05:00]  I did a picture in Ireland.  I played an Irish-American prize fighter in a picture called Strength and Honor.  And the first time I produced a picture, and I tried to get involved in the distribution  and all that.  And I learned a lot of lessons about the way that that stuff goes.  And believe me, there's a lot of big money changing hands for promotional campaigns and  this kind of thing.  And, you know, the picture really got overlooked, and I'm trying to get some guys to re-release  it, but I think I'm up against a stacked deck. 
[03:05:30]  I mean, it's really hard to...  It's hard to make room.  They don't make room for anybody, you know?  It's a very Dougie-Doug thing.  Yeah, they got the thing figured out the way they want it to make the most, and they  don't want anybody changing the rules on them, I guess.  Well, as soon as I get in there, I'll be saying, telling them that they're all the  greatest guys in the world, you know?  I was wrong, you know?  No, I was just kidding when I was on the radio.  Holy shit.  I've been nominated.  He's living our life. 
[03:06:00]  I know.  Jesus.  Get me a towel.  Get Michael a towel.  I'll do a scene with a towel.  I'm scared to ask him questions about movies he's been in now.  I'm very lucky, and I've been very fortunate.  Actually, you have been in great movies.  I'm in a great industry.  I really am.  I'm just kidding around with you guys.  Someone threw you in IMDb, and they're saying, un-fucking-believable, you made 18 movies  for 2008 alone.  Well, I got six boys to take care of, and, you know, I need to keep a lot of groceries  in the fridge. 
[03:06:30]  You have six kids?  Yeah.  Yeah, boys.  Wow.  My house is like Lord of the Flies.  I actually saw it.  It was like theme days.  Like, one day, they'll all dress up as cowboys and Indians.  They're running through the house, spearing each other and shooting arrows at me.  You know, it's amazing.  I got a striped shirt with a whistle.  That's basically my wardrobe when I'm at home, you know?  Yeah.  No, it's just...  You know, it was the Army day, the little camel flies are in camis.  They're out in the bushes, you know, shooting paintballs at each other. 
[03:07:00]  It's insane.  I mean, I don't know how my wife, she's amazing.  She deals with it.  They tied her up one time.  Tied her to a tree outside, you know, and she was like, Mike, oh, God, my God, help me.  I couldn't believe it.  I always wish I had brothers growing up, but now I got all these sons, and it's just like  amazing the way they are with each other.  I didn't miss fuck all, you know?  I got to ask the obvious.  Have you ever done stand-up, Michael?  Have you ever done stand-up?  No. 
[03:07:30]  Nobody ever asked me that.  He did stand-up, though, and if a heckler ever mess with him...  If I didn't stand-up, I always thought that I would want to do this thing where one time  I was in my trailer and I was making a movie.  I was in Poland, and I was so fucking bored.  I was going out of my mind, right?  I had a shit in a bucket.  All right?  That's how low-budget it was.  And I was just sitting there thinking, my God, is this what it is? 
[03:08:00]  I was being eaten alive by all these Polish insects.  You know, it was like four o'clock in the morning, and I was like, oh, my God.  You know, I wish I was a lumberjack.  This is so fucked up, you know?  I just don't want to be in this business.  Why am I here?  And I started thinking, for some strange reason, about a hotel that could open up, and they  could call themselves the Kevorkian Suites.  And so you would check in, and they would have all these different themes in different 
[03:08:30]  rooms where you could go to kill yourself.  To die.  Yeah.  To kill you.  Yeah, yeah.  And so I was thinking, oh, man, I'm really on to something here.  So I started writing it down.  And I started thinking, okay, all right.  In one suite, they call it the Robin Given Suite.  And when you go in, there's like a piece of glass.  And on the counter in front of you is a gun.  And she's behind the glass, and she's going on and on about her relationship with Mike Tyson.  And she just keeps going on and on and on and on about it. 
[03:09:00]  And she won't stop, and you can't leave the room until finally, you know, you either shoot  yourself in the head or keep on listening to her.  And I thought another one would be like, you go in, and when you go in, they inject you  and put you to sleep.  And then there's a big metal sliding door on the other side of the room.  And when you wake up, the door comes open, and there's a big gorilla standing there.  And then you suddenly realize you have bananas around your neck. 
[03:09:30]  On a chain, right?  And you're like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Fucking hell.  And you grab hold of him because you want to give him to the ape.  But you realize they're made out of plastic.  And he's just coming at you, you know?  And he's going to rip you apart.  Do you smoke a lot of weed?  That's hysterical.  You just got to get...  You think about certain things like that.  Why not?  That's what you think about in Poland when you have to shit in a bucket.  Shit in a bucket and Polish bugs are eating you. 
[03:10:00]  And you're waiting to go on the set to play something.  And you used to shit in a spackle bucket.  I was in construction.  You have to sit in there, right?  Anyway, that's it for my stand-up career.  Damn.  Well, that would go over.  I'm not going to ask you about the greatest scene in Reservoir Dogs now.  I don't want to know the sarcastic answer to that.  Oh, actually...  That's probably what you're asked the most anyway, right?  You're probably sick of talking about that scene.  No, not really. 
[03:10:30]  I mean, I'm lucky to have anything that anybody wants to talk to me about.  I could be, you know, digging ditches somewhere.  How was it working with Quentin?  We had him on the show, and we were just amazed by the guy.  He's a nut.  If I cured cancer, and I was at a news conference, and they were asking me about my findings,  most likely someone would stand up and say,  that's great about the cancer thing, Michael, but what's it like working with Quentin?  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[03:11:00]  Just let him talk.  He's a great guy.  He's a genius.  Wow, he can talk, though, huh?  Yeah, yeah, he can go on, but at least it's interesting.  Yeah.  He's kind of a film historian, the guy.  I mean, he's got about 335-millimeter prints of movies in his garage.  And those film nights, those themed film nights and stuff.  Yeah, he's got a regular theater in his house with the curtains and a popcorn machine and  the whole fucking thing.  You know, after our interview with him, we felt like we were going to be invited over  to movie night. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, did you?  You know how you told that story about Bruce?  And he's like, yeah, next time you're in LA, give us, you know, give me a call.  But the problem was he never really wanted to exchange numbers or anything.  You know, he's hard to nail down.  I mean, when I did Kill Bill, it was only because I drove it to his house and I knew  the gate code.  And I just went and I sat by the pool and I waited for him to get home.  You know, I sat there for like two hours and finally he showed up.  I'm like, Quentin, what the fuck is going on?  Did I need a job, man?  You know, what are you doing? 
[03:12:00]  And then he whipped out the Kill Bill script and I was playing Bud, but Jesus, if I had  to wait for him to call me, I mean, it never would have happened.  It never would have worked.  Kill Bill gets just better and better the more you watch it, too.  It's just one of those movies you never get sick of.  Yeah, I think a lot of people.  Oh, my God.  Great time, man.  It was a wonderful experience.  It was really one of those pictures that stands out in your mind, you know.  Quentin's got a good way of pulling people out of relative obscurity.  Like, then came Bronson, you know.  Michael Parks, yeah.  Michael Parks is hysterical. 
[03:12:30]  Hey, I'm wonderful.  What the hell knew?  Now, it's obvious to ask Michael about some of the great roles he's been in.  What was the biggest piece of shit you were involved with?  I think this is the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  Oh, damn.  Holy shit, we got a new promo.  Oh, yeah.  Put that in the fucking intro to the radio show.  Oh, shit. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  Now that I'm completely uncomfortable.  That's great.  Oh, fuck that.  That's fantastic.  And I also took notice that, you know, fuck it, we're letting it all out.  He comes in, I go, hi, I'm Opie.  And he gave me a look like...  What a stupid name.  I was just trying to figure out if you were the one that had to take a shit.  Yeah, I saw it in his eyes.  I'm like, I know.  I've been stuck with his dumb name since I was 12.  Will you give me a break?  You just changed it, man.  All in his eyes.  I haven't changed it.  He didn't even have to say anything. 
[03:13:30]  I just saw it in his eyes.  Change the name, man.  I would love to.  We're just knifing.  Oh, there's so many ridiculous fucking radio shows do you have to do, you know?  I met Ron Howard once and I called him Opie and he never hired me.  I thought it was going to be funny, you know, and I was like, hey, Opie, I thought, you know,  I thought he would take it in the right way, but he doesn't really know how to take a joke.  He probably says something like, if I cured cancer, people would...  You won't see me in any Ron Howard films, but it's that way. 
[03:14:00]  That's how quick it can end for you.  Hey, what about this movie?  Do you want to talk about the new movie?  I don't even know.  Boardingate?  Listen, I shot that picture in Paris.  I played a stockbroker with a girlfriend who was a dominatrix.  I saw half of it.  Rowan gave me the movie and I watched it last night, but halfway through, the fucking DVD  gave me had a scratch, but it was right... 
[03:14:30]  The movie...  Where did it end?  The scratch?  Right when you were about to get...  Right before she pulled the gun out, you were about to get killed.  Oh, good.  Oh, so he gets killed in the movie.  Thanks, Bob.  Thanks for giving that away.  Good one, Bobby.  I don't know.  I don't know if he got killed.  That's what I'm saying.  I didn't see it.  She pulled the gun out.  Honestly, I got it.  I pulled the gun out, but the sex before that, it was this big lead up.  So they were doing all this kinky shit, dude.  I don't know.  She pulled the gun out.  There was handcuffs.  He had a belt around his neck. 
[03:15:00]  I was watching it with my wife, and it's so sexy.  It's a Valentine's Day movie.  Dude, I didn't know.  The sex in this is so dirty and sexy, but it's beyond what sexy in a movie is.  It's one point where he actually...  She's got a belt.  This girl's hot, too.  She's dirty hot.  Yeah.  She's got tattoos everywhere.  She's really sexy.  I don't know.  Is she German or something?  I don't know.  She's Italian. 
[03:15:30]  Is she Italian?  Yeah.  She's got that accent.  The blah, blah, blah.  The blah, blah, blah.  I don't know.  But he grabs her.  His rage...  Can I just say something about your rage, dude?  The way he is right now with that voice.  He's very quiet.  He's very cool.  And then all of a sudden...  And then he goes right back to...  Wow.  Sometimes you want a beer.  Honestly, God, dude.  His rage is like that real fucking holy shit rage. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  You see it in this movie.  He's just talking to her.  And then she says something.  And he goes...  I didn't invite...  And it just snaps.  And then all of a sudden they're outside.  It's this scene.  She gets in her...  He rips her clothes off.  Nice.  And she rips her belt off.  And he goes down in front of her.  Oh, I don't know how you...  She's reaching around and grabs...  And her hands is...  There's no faking this.  Dude, it's fucking satellite.  It's satellite.  Where did he put his dick?  What are you fucking beating around the bush? 
[03:16:30]  She just...  I'm sorry.  I'm getting nervous.  He grabbed...  She just reached in, unzipped his fly.  It was open.  And she's just stroking his mule.  And he's in front of her.  And just smelling her fucking pussy.  But through the underwear.  Which is even sexier.  He didn't even just rip them down.  He's just...  Holy shit.  And you're looking to see if he starts...  Kissing her thigh.  But then he's just...  Fuck it. 
[03:17:00]  And I'm watching it with my wife.  And in my head I'm going...  Now I'm going to have to fuck her.  Now I'm going to have to fuck my wife.  Apparently it is a good Valentine's Day movie.  Because in this fucking movie...  I'm going to have to fuck her tonight.  It's a Disney movie in Bulgaria, by the way.  It should have been released on Valentine's Day.  Wow.  Fucking...  But this is the one that...  It fucks with you.  Because all of a sudden they'll just stop.  And she'll go...  I don't love you anymore.  And he's like...  But he's like...  I don't know what you got to do.  And they'll go in a room...  And then we'll go back into dialogue.  A lot of really good dialogue.  Yeah.  And then they just start fucking... 
[03:17:30]  Like...  Just fucking smashing each other over the face.  Bobby has given this movie a better plug than anyone else could.  I know.  I don't even have to be here.  No.  I want to...  Who doesn't want to...  You should go to work for the distributor.  Where's my copy?  Yeah.  The scene in the front when you and your office is so fucking...  It's so back and forth.  I never get to do a picture with a girl.  I'm always beating somebody up or smoking a cigarette or shooting a gun.  And I never get to do any love scenes, you know.  Love.  I never get to go. 
[03:18:00]  I don't want to ride off into the sunset with the girl, you know.  All of us.  I was happy when they gave me the part.  It was my chance to break my stereotype, you know.  Yeah.  You had a great love scene.  Ruined my reputation.  What was the love scene?  He got a girl.  He fucked her.  Oh, my God.  He didn't kill anybody.  He didn't shoot anybody.  What was going on?  What was the love scene he had where he's fucking the dude's wife as he's in the...  Oh, is that fucking hysterical?  You get a love scene? 
[03:18:30]  The getaway.  Yeah.  The getaway.  Loved getaway.  Just shuts the door in his face.  What are you looking at?  That was one of the most despicable scenes.  What are you looking at?  You fucking...  Yeah, he's basically...  And she's all into it.  He's just fucked.  He's a nerdy dude tied up in the bathroom as Michael's banging his wife.  I love that scene, by the way.  But in his business...  It was such a good fuck that the guy...  He kills himself, right?  He hung himself.  Yeah.  He hanged himself in the bathroom.  That was one of those really hot but disturbing scenes because... 
[03:19:00]  What a way to go.  You're thinking of it, but then you're like, Jesus Christ, what if you're in that situation?  And you're not the fucking guy fucking abroad.  You're the one chained to the toilet or whatever.  And your old lady come in the next room.  Yeah.  And she's enjoying it.  You haven't seen that scene, Bobby?  I've seen it, but that's one of those things where the verbal saying that out loud makes  you go, ah.  Yeah.  Just the way he just said it.  Awful.  And she's coming. 
[03:19:30]  It's a remake.  It's a remake of a Sam Beckenpah picture.  Yeah, the getaway, right?  But you know what he has in this movie, too, which a lot of movies he does.  We're back to Boarding Gate, the new movie that comes out March 21st, limited release.  Certain actors, like Robert Duvall does it, and certain actors that do this business,  like stuff that's not in the, you know it's in the script, and it's just him doing it.  There was one part he ate, he was eating this food, and he makes the fucking, just him  eating it, it's just so interesting.  And then he just, he has like an olive pit in his mouth, and he's delivering his line, 
[03:20:00]  and he just goes, pfft, and spits it into the sink.  Like, it's like, you know, he's just like, holy shit.  Because you get, when you're an actor, you get a script, you just read the lines, you  do the things, you know, he just went, pfft, pfft.  Oh, sure.  Look, that's the fun of it, you know.  I think I try to get away with things like that as much as I possibly can.  I mean, that's why, you know, a guy like Quentin, even a guy like Olivia for Boarding  Gate, I mean, they both gave me that gift of being able to be on the spot and in the 
[03:20:30]  moment and let something happen just because it happened, not because it's on the page.  That's a lot better for me.  It's a lot easier for me.  It's a lot freer way to work.  When I cut that ear off, you know, I walked over to the side of the room, and I was holding,  I was looking at it, and I was thinking in my head, what am I going to do with this fucking  thing, right?  I got this fucking ear in my hand.  What am I going to do?  You know, and they're rolling, right?  So I'm just holding it.  I'm thinking, okay, what am I going to do?  And Quentin's over on the side, and he's going, toss it.  Throw the ear, Michael.  Throw it away, Michael. 
[03:21:00]  Throw it.  Throw it.  And I'm thinking to myself, no, I don't want to do it.  I don't want to throw it yet, you know?  And so I've spoken to him.  I said, hey, can you hear me?  You know?  And then I threw it, you know?  Fucking twisted.  And so Quentin's like, I can't believe you did that.  I'm like, well, what do you mean?  He goes, no, no, no.  What are you doing?  You're talking in the ear?  And then to the next day, he goes, Michael, listen, we went to saw the dailies, you know?  And when you're talking in the ear, it's staying in the movie.  It's such a, yeah. 
[03:21:30]  That's awesome.  It's such a, because only a fucking lunatic would do something like that.  And the character's obviously out of his mind.  Yeah.  Hey, can you hear me?  I figured, you know, it was the thing to do.  I mean, if you're going to have it, it just made sense to me at the most point.  We were talking to Quentin about that movie and that scene in Reservoir Dogs.  And one of the most, I don't know, the one with the most impact to me is when you walk 
[03:22:00]  outside of that funeral parlor and you hear the birds chirping, it's sunny, kids are playing.  And it's such a stark difference from the horror that is going on behind those doors.  Like for a moment, you're out of it.  And you're just outside.  It's a beautiful day.  Going to get the gas.  Yeah, going to get the gas to burn them with.  That was my car, that yellow Cadillac.  It's on eBay.  That really your car?  I put it on eBay.  It's up for sale right now.  Get the fuck out of here, really?  That was my car.  I drove it to the set that day and that's where I parked it. 
[03:22:30]  And I swear to God, when we were going to shoot the scene, they were going to go to  budget and rent a car for Mr. Blonde for the thing where the cop's in the truck.  And I said, why?  Why don't we just use my car?  It's right there.  And Quinn says, oh, that's a good idea.  Let's just use your car.  So when I walk out there and the Caddy's there, I mean, that's because that's how I parked  when I came to work that day.  Damn, that's on eBay, huh?  I've had the damn thing for about 15 years and I put it on eBay. 
[03:23:00]  What do you want for the instant?  I don't know.  I think John Schneider got $4 million for the Dukes of Hazzard Chargers.  You're looking for $4 million?  I don't know.  Anything's possible, right?  You never know.  I mean, you know, I won't have to go back to Bulgaria to go to work.  Fucking Bulgaria.  What is going on?  Why is Michael Madsen in Bulgaria doing a movie?  Well, you know, Paramount hasn't called lately.  Well, you're going to be in Sin City too, right?  Well, if they ever get around to making it, I'm supposedly going to be in it. 
[03:23:30]  Robert Rodriguez told me if I did the first one and it did well that he'd bring me back  for the second one.  So, you know, with those guys, you just kind of have to wait until they're ready.  So, I mean, there's no use calling him.  If he wants you, he's going to ring you up.  So, I hope I do.  It was a great picture.  I mean, it was a lot of fun doing that thing.  And the one thing talking about just reading lines off a page and then doing the things  that make a great actor different from someone just reading lines, the facial expressions  you can make, you don't have to say words. 
[03:24:00]  And that's a talent in itself.  Like, you can make a look and just go, oh, my God, this person is so fucked.  This person is so fucked just from a look.  It comes from a nefarious childhood.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Sometimes it's just out of boredom.  Yeah.  You didn't have any professional training or anything?  After about this three or four take, man, you got to come up with something.  Nothing like that?  Just kind of?  I tried to.  Early on, I went to Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago.  I tried to take a scene study classes there for a bit. 
[03:24:30]  And I just kind of fell out of it.  But I'm a very impatient young man.  And I just wanted to get on with it.  And I figured if this is what I'm going to do, I'm going to do it.  I don't want to be a career student.  And, you know, God bless anybody who's studying.  I'm not trying to take anything away from them.  It works for them.  That's fine.  But for me, I just didn't understand all the sense memory business.  You know, pretending that this fucking thing is boiling hot or, you know, pretending that  I'm blown in the wind or something. 
[03:25:00]  It was really kind of...  I didn't really need that whole thing.  And I didn't figure I was going to end up playing Hamlet anyway.  So, you know...  You want to fan of the Meisner technique?  I just wanted to get on with it.  So, I really kind of sidestepped all that.  And...  How'd you break in?  What was like your first...  What was the first role you did where you went, wow, I think I'm doing this for a living  now?  I went to...  Well, first I came to New York.  I met Sergio Leone when I was here.  And he told me I should pursue an acting career. 
[03:25:30]  And he had a film he wanted me to do, but then unfortunately he died.  So, I went to L.A. and I had 400 bucks.  I got a job pumping gas at the Union 76 station in Beverly Hills.  And, you know, my first customer was Fred Astaire.  I swear to God, it was on Christmas Eve and Fred Astaire fucking pulls in with a flat tire  on his car.  And I'm like this kid from Chicago and I'm like, holy shit.  You know, my fucking God in heaven, it's him, you know. 
[03:26:00]  It's him.  You know, he gets out of the car and he says, hey, and he, you know, pops me off a hundred  dollar bill.  And I says, look, it's $12.50 for the flat, you know.  And he just walks off and I'm like, holy Christ, you know.  And my boss comes over to me and I says, Jesus Christ, is that him?  And he goes, oh yeah, get used to it, kid.  Those guys come in here all the time.  And they sure did, boy.  I mean, I've seen everybody.  I didn't realize I was right in the middle of Beverly Hills. 
[03:26:30]  And so over the next nine or ten months that I worked there, I've seen everybody come in  there for gas at one time or another.  And it was pretty amazing.  And I finally met a girl and she knew a guy and so on, so on, so on, so on.  They knew an agent and this and that and this and that.  That's how it works.  And I went and I read for an episodic television show called St. Elsewhere.  And when I went to the thing, I had to go to work and I was figuring I was going to be  late.  So when I went to read for the part, I had my Union 76 outfit on because I was going to 
[03:27:00]  work, right?  And so I went in and I read, it was the bad brother.  I was like the bully brother of a family of bigots.  And, you know, it was, I was the hood, the hoodlum brother.  And by the time I got to work, there was a message for me to call this agent and I called  him up and I said, what's up?  And he said, you got the job.  And I said, wow, I was, you know, I couldn't believe it.  I was pretty stunned.  And they said, yeah, you know, the casting director said how brilliant it was that you 
[03:27:30]  came in dressed as a working class person.  Yeah.  And I said, what do you think?  I went to Western costume and fucking bought that.  I was going to work for God's sake.  You're on the phone, they're hearing the ding, ding of the cars driving over the fucking  hose.  It worked though, I guess.  That was the first thing I ever did.  It was Denzel Washington was in it and David Morris, it was a TV series about a hospital  thing.  And I didn't know what the hell I was doing. 
[03:28:00]  I had a cool jacket.  I remember that.  They gave me this brown leather jacket.  It was kind of cool.  But then you never looked back.  I just let the jacket act for me.  You let the jacket do the work.  I was like, I don't know what I'm doing, but I got this bitch in jacket.  What's the fuck with me?  All right, look at my jacket.  That's great though.  And you kind of, you know, you so vividly remember when you got out of your shit fucking  real job.  Listen, I started getting a couple of things after that.  I got like Miami Vice and Tour of Duty and a couple of other little Jake and the Fat 
[03:28:30]  Man.  A couple of things.  Remember I went to Ray who was running the place and I said, look, Ray, I'm not going  to be here tomorrow because I come here.  He goes, I suppose you're going to go do another one of those television shows.  And I go, well, yeah.  As a matter of fact, I have.  And he goes, listen, kid, you better make up your mind what you're going to do.  He goes, when you signed up here, you didn't tell anybody you were an actor.  And I said, well, I didn't really consider myself one at that time. 
[03:29:00]  And he goes, oh, you're getting intellectual on me now.  I said, no.  I said, no, man, I just really, I got to go do this thing.  And he goes, listen, we need you around here, okay?  So you better make up your fucking mind, kid.  And I'm like, oh, well.  Should I make $2.50 an hour having you yelling at my face, you know, and having people honking  at me, you know, and having Warren Beatty ask me if I should check his oil?  So, you know, or should I go and, you know. 
[03:29:30]  And try to be Warren Beatty.  I said, well, geez, that's going to be a hard decision, Ray.  I said, you know.  Let me think about it.  I need to think about this, yeah.  I'll let you know on Monday.  I'll give you a call, you know.  Yeah, that's something, yeah.  You better make up your mind.  When you really.  Stay here, Ray.  Michael.  I need to help these people.  Fuck Hollywood.  Fuck gas.  Fuck the movies, man.  Fuck it. 
[03:30:00]  Jack Lemon needs me.  He needs a valve job.  God damn it.  When you finally made it, did you ever go back to Ray's place to kind of maybe go, hey,  Ray, what's up?  Pull in for some gas.  Right.  Pull in for some gas.  See who the new kid is.  With a fake flat tire.  I've rolled in there a couple of times, and it's kind of a funny feeling.  Right on.  Yeah.  It's like a whole nother life, you know, a thousand years ago.  I think I backed into one of the pumps one night.  In a limo.  I'm going to knock the damn thing off. 
[03:30:30]  Sorry, Ray, and just pull away.  There goes that son of a bitch.  I remember him.  Stupid kid.  We needed him.  That motherfucker.  You always have the intimidating guy roles or anything.  Growing up, were you like that?  Were you kind of a troublemaker?  Were you kind of just a nice guy with a low, intimidating voice? 
[03:31:00]  My parents divorced when I was young, and we moved around an awful lot.  My father was a Chicago firefighter, and we just were constantly on the move.  So I was always like the new kid, you know?  Yeah.  Whenever you're the new guy, you tend to, you know, hook up with the wrong crowd.  Yeah.  A lot of my pals were kind of dangerous, and I, you know, I learned my lesson early on about 
[03:31:30]  those kinds of things.  Yeah.  You must have taken something away from them and brought it into your acting.  I don't know how I made it, because most of them are dead.  Really?  Yeah.  I got a couple of those.  I was, you know, parents divorced, and then moving around a lot, and the same thing.  You fall in with some real fun people when you're a new.  Because they're always looking for new recruits.  They're looking for new recruits, so you get in.  Yeah.  You get in easy.  They were exciting.  It was the only thing going on, you know?  Yeah. 
[03:32:00]  I was like, sure, let's go rip off a car.  Sounds good to me.  Fuck it.  Breaking into houses and stealing horrible turntables.  Sure.  Oh, God.  I stole a turntable of a church one time.  Jesus.  I did.  I swear to God.  I went to this youth group.  You know, they had a youth lounge, you know?  And they had a really bitchin' stereo in there.  And so, you know, like a couple nights later, I went over there, and I took the damn thing,  and I put it outside in the bushes underneath the floor. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, you had to stash it first.  Yeah, stash.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know how it goes.  Yeah.  How do you know?  See, you're just like me.  I used to do that.  You understand the mentality.  Same stuff.  And I went back and got it, you know, and I put it in my room.  You have to let the heat blow over and see if, like, anyone was onto it and found it  where you stashed it or something like that.  And scratch it up a little, you know?  Yeah.  I found it.  Yeah.  I found it.  Look at this thing.  I found it.  I can't believe it.  And then when you realize the heat's not on.  I took a bike.  Look at this.  I was going to Dana Hills High School when I lived out in California, and I used to walk 
[03:33:00]  home, and I didn't want to fucking walk.  So I went to the bike rack and just grabbed the bike.  And I rode the bike, and I stashed it in the woods, kind of under some shit, where we  used to go with the horses.  And as we were going through one day, I went, hey, wait a minute.  What's that?  And they go, holy shit, a bike.  I found a bike.  And my father goes, my father goes, all right, we got to call the police so they could take  it down to the police station to see if it was stolen. 
[03:33:30]  No, Dad.  So I'm like, yeah, I was like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  They took it down there.  The cops told me, if it's not claimed in three months, it's mine.  Three months.  And three months later, no one claimed it.  So it was mine.  I feel bad about the church thing, you know, but then again, the whole reason I did it  was because the priest was, like, hitting on my mom, you know.  Jesus.  At least he wasn't hitting on you.  That was the worst.  It was the worst.  Then I would have burnt the place to the ground.  With him in it.  I had to wait until he was in there doing his spiel and set the whole fucking place 
[03:34:00]  on fire.  Burnt that motherfucker up with the whole place.  It was bad enough he was hitting on my mom, okay?  We're out there singing the hymns and he's hitting on my mom.  Okay, you fuck.  Guess what I'm going to do later today?  I'm going to rip off your youth lounge, okay?  I'm taking your stereo system, you freak.  So it was completely justified.  You freak motherfucker.  Did I hit on your mom?  Yeah, come on, you know.  That's not right, man.  What's he doing?  He's supposed to be a man of God. 
[03:34:30]  He's, like, hitting on my mom.  That is not right.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Come on, man.  I'm glad I stole that goddamn thing.  Is he the most intimidating guy we've ever had on the show?  I love him.  Jesus Christ.  Top of the list.  Most intimidating guy right here, man.  Open and honest.  No shit.  I'm a dad with six kids and I, you know, I'm really, you know, I play dangerous people,  but I'm a...  You're all right.  I actually saw an interview with you where they showed your house in Malibu and your kids  and...  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, you actually, you were just this nice, peaceful guy.  Almost like...  It was almost...  Well, he writes poetry, right?  Yeah, well, you...  Do a little poetry.  Lately.  Lately.  I kind of got over that.  I got over it.  It was fun for a while.  I wrote a lot of stuff and then finally one day I just figured that's it.  I got nothing else to say.  I mean, I'm just...  I wrote a couple of books and that's it, you know.  I really am going to repeat myself.  The leaves were blowing across the driveway.  Frank Sinatra's dead. 
[03:35:30]  You know, what am I going to do now?  You know, I'll have another shot of whiskey.  I'll light a lucky strike and take a walk in the rain, you know.  Thinking about Frank, you know.  It's like, oh, Jesus, Michael.  God.  What the hell are you writing about it?  It was fun while it lasts.  That was actually kind of good.  Oh, it's in there.  You got to get the book.  It conjured up an image.  It really did.  It's available.  He's got an actual book out.  It's on Amazon.com.  Oh, man.  It conjures up an image. 
[03:36:00]  Do you drink or give that up?  You know, once upon a time, you know, when I was younger, that was definitely the thing  to do.  I mean, I think I probably, well, sure.  I mean, I never lost my mind, but sure.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, it's, you just, you got to know when to say when and you have to wait  till, you have to wait till after work. 
[03:36:30]  Put it that way.  Oh, did you ever, uh, on the job?  Did you ever drink on the job?  No, it's kind of dangerous, especially if you have to jump out of a Hummer onto the  flatbed truck or you got to fall through a plate glass table or you're shooting off  guns.  You know, you better be careful and you can't be, uh, hammered.  You know, that's how accidents happen.  Yeah.  Who the hell is that one guy?  It happens every so often.  Yeah.  Oh, John Eric Hexum?  Yeah, that's a perfect example.  Yeah, he's got a blank gun, he put it against his temple and pulls the trigger and you're  still getting the same force coming out of the barrel and the thing, uh, put a piece 
[03:37:00]  of bone right through his brain.  Yeah.  What the hell are you doing?  It's a gun, you idiot.  A movie set can be a dangerous place.  You got to be careful.  You got to know what you're doing.  Yeah.  You handle a lot.  Do you, do you shoot, uh, guns at all, uh, real life?  I got a, I got a Winchester pump.  I got a 12 gauge shotgun.  Home security.  Keep talking.  Making Anthony hard.  I love that shit.  Yeah.  It's a nice gun. 
[03:37:30]  Winchester pump.  Yeah.  Look at Anthony.  The gun actually used to belong to, uh, Steve McQueen.  Oh, wow.  It's the, it's the one that he used in the getaway.  You know, when he goes in the gun shop and, uh, and he gets the shotgun, he takes the shells,  he puts them in his pocket, he wraps it up in paper, he goes outside and he tells the  cops to lay down in the street and he's like, blast in the squad car, slow motion.  Sam Peckinpah.  He kept, he kept that gun and he really liked that one.  And, uh, years later I became friends with his son, Chad and me and Chad were hammered 
[03:38:00]  one night.  Um, it was my birthday and I was over at Chad's and he knew that I was a big fan of that picture  and, uh, he gave me the shotgun.  He gave me Steve.  Wow.  So that's a fucking present.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it kind of was, it kind of was.  That's a nice thing to have around the house.  There's a guy whose, like, career transcends time.  There are people now that are huge McQueen fans that weren't even alive when, uh, when  he died.  Steve was much too young to, uh, to go away, but God, what he left behind. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  Great movies.  Yeah, well, there was a different time and there was a different kind of directors back  then and there was a whole different mindset.  Yeah.  Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong era.  Yeah.  A little earlier would have been a little better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, the guys like Peckinpah and some of those cats, you know, they make us a pretty  good picture.  That was some sick shit, Peckinpah, man.  It's like, yeah, this isn't graphic enough.  Let me slow it down to see shit flying out of their backs.  Listen, he's up in the crane with a tumbler of vodka, you know, a bar on the set. 
[03:39:00]  Those were the days, right?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Made some great movies.  Yeah.  Yeah, he sure did.  I know his godson, uh, Joseph Culp.  He's Robert Culp's son.  Oh, yeah?  Told me some good Peckinpah stories, yeah.  He told me that when they did, um, when they were doing, um, Wild Bunch, that, uh, at a  lunch break, Ben Johnson and Bill and, I guess, uh, they took some chickens and they buried 
[03:39:30]  them in the ground with only their heads sticking out of the top of the dirt.  Jesus.  And then they were all get back with their rifles and they were going to take a target  shot and see who could blow their heads off.  But the chickens, when they're buried in the ground, they go like, they fell asleep.  Their heads just go like this, like they're dead.  And they just fall asleep and they're like, oh, man, this ain't going to be no fun.  They're going to pop their heads off, but they're all, they're sleeping.  You know, this isn't right, right? 
[03:40:00]  That isn't right.  And so apparently.  If they're up and clunking, that's perfectly fine.  Yeah.  But sleeping, that's not right.  So apparently Mr. Peckinpah.  Jesus Christ.  Apparently Sam, Sam Peckinpah, apparently him, or maybe it was Warren Oates, one of the two  of them apparently went over to the sleeping chickens and squirted Zippo lighter fluid on  all their heads.  Oh, my God.  It woke them up, yeah. 
[03:40:30]  And they were awake then, man.  And then, I guess then the shooting began.  The target practice commenced after that.  And they had to put them out of their misery.  Then it was humane.  Right.  Of course.  Of course.  Their eyes are stinging fire.  Holy shit.  Boy, it certainly was a different time.  Yeah.  Boy, boy.  Was the Humane Society person on set that day?  No, I don't think those folks were around me. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, probably not.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How many goddamn stories must you have?  Holy shit.  Right afloat.  We've been here for a long time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're supposed to be talking about Boarding Gate.  Yes.  The movie was...  The half of the movie that I saw was...  All right.  You saw half the movie.  Don't make it sound like...  Did you see it?  The half that I...  No, I got it in my pocket right now.  I saw it, so shut your face.  I got a screener copy.  I'm not in the other half, so it's fine.  Michael, we like...  I'm talking about the half he was in.  We like to be prepared for these interviews, obviously. 
[03:41:30]  And Roland, he didn't do the job.  He hands out these movies on Valentine's Day.  We all got girls.  And he also handed out a movie that was broken.  So halfway through.  He calls me.  He goes, I want to deliver the movie.  Because, you know, you got Michael Madsen coming in tomorrow.  I'm like, dude, I'm going to dinner in a half hour.  So I apologize.  But the synopsis, it's a story about a sexy ex-prostitute who's forced to flee London after a steamy S&M encounter.  You saw that, right, Bob?  That part?  Yeah, there's a couple of steamy steamy.  It ends in violence. 
[03:42:00]  That's Madsen playing the ex-lover.  She flees to Hong Kong and becomes involved with a couple who promised to help her get her papers and money.  But nothing turns out the way it was supposed to.  And the ex-prostitute ends up trapped in a sordid game of manipulation.  You don't sound like the trailer guy.  Wow.  No, it's not heavy, man.  It's one of the sexiest sex scenes.  It sounds like a movie I would enjoy.  I mean, it's just sexy, sexy.  And you review your own movies, right?  Directed by Olivia Esaias, who's a great, great guy.  Great director.  Great director, yeah. 
[03:42:30]  One of my favorite scenes is when you're eating your food and she's trying to fuck with him.  And he takes a tomato and just sticks it in her face.  She slaps it out of his hand.  But you know it wasn't in the script.  She's talking.  You know she's annoying him.  He takes it to me and just sticks it in her face.  It's like, what?  Oh, you've done that before.  What guy hasn't done that?  He's just a mushy tomato in her face.  And he just starts laughing.  She's angry.  You know, as an actor, she really was pissed.  Like, what are you fucking doing?  And he's like, his little laugh he does is like, that right there. 
[03:43:00]  She's a wonderful girl.  I really liked working with her.  I wish we would have had more stuff to do together.  I mean, she's a great little girl.  She's a...  How great is it when he...  We'd be great together in another film.  I hope somebody finds a script for us.  How great is it when he does laugh in some of these movies?  Dude, he...  Maniacal.  That's what I'm saying, dude.  The scariest part about him is when he's laughing.  Right.  That's when you're scared of him.  That's when I...  He starts laughing.  You're like, oh, shit.  I pissed him off.  Sure.  And, uh...  But can I ask you a question, though? 
[03:43:30]  Doing a scene with that...  Like, regular sex scenes in these movies, you can tell it's choreographed and everything.  But this looked really improv to what you guys were doing.  Because, like...  I mean, did you get...  I mean, she's smoking.  The first time I've seen her, she was sitting in a window.  And I was walking by this little courtyard in Paris.  And I seen her sitting there.  And I had a peach in my hand.  And so I...  I give her the peach through the window. 
[03:44:00]  And I went on the set.  And then when I got there, I was waiting for her to come in.  And she comes in.  And she's got a fist like this.  And I'm like, well, what's she gonna do now?  And she goes like this.  And she opens up her hand.  And she's got the pit in her hand, you know?  And she ate the whole fucking thing.  And, um...  I realized she's holding a can of beer with a napkin around it.  And she's got a straw in it.  And I said, listen, I really like this girl.  You know?  I mean, it was a great introduction. 
[03:44:30]  You know what I mean?  There's a lot to be said for that first impression thing.  Sure.  And there was a lot of things in the script that just said, you know, they begin to do this.  And they simultaneously climax.  And all these kind of things.  Or they write this kind of stuff.  But they don't...  The writer doesn't really realize that you actually have to do that.  And so I think she was game enough to just...  You know, and Olivia was game enough to just run the camera.  And if I just know what my parameters of the room are, where I can go out of frame and in frame, 
[03:45:00]  I think it's always better to just kind of just make it up as you go.  And that's what we did.  And you can tell, man.  There's one point where he...  She says, you're staying.  And you know that.  And she's like...  He goes, say yes.  She goes, yes.  And he goes, and I'm putting handcuffs on you.  And I'm fucking you.  And she goes, yes.  My dick filled up.  And I'm trying to hide it from my wife.  Because I don't want her to know that I want to tie some bitch up and make her my slave. 
[03:45:30]  And then slap tomatoes in her face.  You remember when Jimmy Cagney put that grapefruit in that...  Oh, classic.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  He did it before I did.  Just smushed.  Yeah.  Smushed that thing right in her face.  Nothing better than mushing something in a chick's face.  So much better than hitting her.  Food, man.  Take thing.  What?  You hungry?  Here.  Stick her face with a bowl of porridge.  Eat this.  Come on.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Do it now.  Oh, Christ.  Eat this fucking thing, too. 
[03:46:00]  I hate to say it.  I hate to say it, but we're getting the wrap-up song.  Running out of time.  I hate this.  Okay, guys.  Listen, thanks a lot for having me.  Please.  I really appreciate it.  Are you kidding?  I love New York City.  It's really cool to be here.  Can we have your number?  Like, when we're having a slow show, we'll just call in and you can tell a story.  Jesus Christ.  I can't do that.  His opinion of the show hasn't changed.  I'll be at Quentin's.  What an asshole.  Trying to get a job.  What an asshole.  Trying to get a job.  You're fitting perfect with this fucking show. 
[03:46:30]  I love it.  Maybe I have future employment in radio.  Yeah, you think you do, man.  Listen, if the movies don't work out with me, I'll be back.  Yeah.  So it's Boarding Gate, March 21st, so we've got to remember that.  Yep.  We'll promote it when it gets closer, absolutely.  Thank you, folks.  Or you can call us and remind us.  You guys are a lot of fun.  We'll have Roland get in touch, and that way you can give us a quick call or something  when it comes out.  And, of course, michaelmatson.com.  And someone was telling me you review your own movies.  That's got to be weird.  I kind of figured I had to make an excuse for some of the crap I've put out there. 
[03:47:00]  There's a lot of stuff in there that I figured I needed to explain myself.  I don't want anybody to think that I'm thinking it's all wonderful.  Like which one?  I think there's a – I made about 74 pictures.  I think there's about 15 of them that are really good, and I think there's probably  about 25 that are okay.  And nobody ever lost any money on me, but some of them I did to pay the mortgage, you 
[03:47:30]  know?  Wait a minute.  Is this you suggesting what to see and what not to see of your own movies?  Yeah.  Wait, go up.  You've got to go to michaelmatson.com.  This is amazing.  Only a while ago.  He recommends movies.  Recommend if you can find it movies.  Watchable movies.  Are these all movies you're in or just movies in general?  No, they're the ones I'm in.  Yeah.  Watchable.  You're in Choke?  Yeah.  I did that with Dennis Hopper.  That's based on the Palahniuk? 
[03:48:00]  No, they stole the title from us.  I did the original Choke.  Okay.  With Dennis.  And then Watchable, and then it gets down to Skip It.  His own movies, he's telling them to skip it.  And then he goes down to Unwatchable.  Holy shit.  And he lists the ones that are just completely unwatchable.  And then Can't Rate, Never Seen It.  So this time you've never even seen it, you've been in the movie, you've never seen it.  Can't Rate, Never Seen It.  Have you ever seen a more honest fucking actor? 
[03:48:30]  Jesus Christ.  No wonder you're not getting work in the United States.  Exactly.  You see how that shit works?  How about you don't burn a bridge?  Yeah, I'm going to hire him.  No fucking way.  He's an indie guy.  Yeah.  Okay, man.  Here's an example.  You've got to go to his website.  It's better than this interview.  Flat Out, which is one of the movies.  Was it a movie?  I don't even know.  Yeah, it was a picture.  It's in the section Can't Rate, Never Seen It.  And this is a one line he gives for Flat Out. 
[03:49:00]  Interesting film about a paralyzed motorcycle race, shot in two days as a favor to the producer.  It's like helping someone move.  That's kind of exactly what it was.  It's like either move a couch or make a movie for two days.  If I hadn't have done it, I would have had to move.  It was time to pay the rent, man.  That is horrible.  Wow.  Oh, that's fantastic.  All right, here's another one.  You know, I've got to do this.  Ghost. 
[03:49:30]  I know you've got to go, but this is too good.  Ghost, he explains it this way.  Low-budget movie, made during a time I was trying to pay my mortgage, also released  as Code of the Dragon.  Trying to pay the mortgage.  Holy fucking honesty.  Yeah, I could have said a few more things about that piece of shit.  You know, when you come back...  A kid who's the lead in that grandfather financed the movie, so, you know, that's all I need  to say.  Yeah, says enough right there. 
[03:50:00]  He said you were hired for a Sweet Sixteen party, basically.  James Dean's mantle is well-protected.  Goddamn.  Michael Madsen, can't thank you enough for coming in.  You guys are cool, man.  Been a fan for so long.  When you're in New York in another five years, you know, stop by.  Stop by, we'll still be languishing here in mediocrity.  Yeah, if you guys are still around.  Yeah, we'll be here.  The new movie... 
[03:50:30]  I guess he likes this movie, because he's promoting it, so...  They're probably going to fire me from the press tour.  Jesus Christ, did you hear the shit he was saying?  Get him out of the city.  Send him back to L.A.  The movie is Boarding Gate.  It comes out March 21st.  MichaelMadsen.com.  Michael, one of the best interviews we've ever had.  Yeah, absolutely.  We can easily say that.  In our week here on the air, it's been amazing. 
[03:51:00]  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks for stopping by our college radio show.  Yeah, we'll take a quick break, and we'll fucking end this mess.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  This is an emergency broadcast.  The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I think we're all in love.  How fucking great was that?  Michael Madsen from, of course, Kill Bill. 
[03:51:30]  All three of us have man crushes.  You know, get away.  And Reservoir Dogs and Free Will It.  What?  Free Will It.  I'm going to say one thing.  Yeah.  If anybody on any message board says that that wasn't a great time with Michael Madsen,  I wouldn't even call it an interview.  That was just a hang with his stories and stuff.  They're insane and should be banned from the board.  Because that was amazing. 
[03:52:00]  You're giving power.  Oh, I know.  Fuck what they say.  Because I want people to complain.  Give the shit.  And then get banned because it'll be funny.  Give the shit.  That was so much fucking fun.  And someone like that, you know, he's been in some of the best movies you're ever going  to watch.  And then he sits down there and he's hysterical.  Dude.  And he's so fucking honest and open.  All with that voice. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  That voice that made it sound like you had one of those old time speakers where it had  a crack in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a crackle.  I don't even got that thing going.  It's just one time I shot a bucket in Moscow.  Ah, E-Rock.  There it is.  There's my signed copy of Reservoir Dogs.  I haven't got a signed copy of anything.  And my signed copy of Kill Bill.  And my signed copy of Lost.  Can I see that?  What a banner day this has been.  Oh, yeah.  Let me hand it over to you.  I haven't worked with you for a dozen years.  Get out of here.  You insane. 
[03:53:00]  I forgot about it.  Let's get off the turnip truck.  Well, I knew we were going to get along because, you know, he sits down.  Before he sits down, like, I just want to introduce myself.  I'm Opie.  He gives me this look like, an Opie.  Why would you do that to yourself?  Why am I dealing with an Opie?  What the fuck is this?  We had to tell him to shut up because he was killing.  The two minutes before we went on the air for the first time with him, he was killing. 
[03:53:30]  We're like, oh, my God, shut up.  I know.  Like, here's what happens.  They bring a guest in sometimes before we're back from commercials.  Sometimes they bring him in when we're on the air.  Right.  When they bring him in early, it's very awkward because you don't, you want to talk to them,  but you don't want to say anything that's interesting because you don't want it to miss on the air.  You want to do that on the air.  Right.  But then you don't want to say something stupid because you don't want to say something stupid and boring.  Right.  So it's really a rough situation.  So we started talking, and he just started coming out with some funny shit. 
[03:54:00]  And Opie just goes, look, we're going to have to just stop talking.  Yeah.  And don't say another word.  And also, at that point, you just throw the script away.  We don't have a script, but you know what I mean.  You try to prepare and think, all right, what do you want to ask Michael Madsen?  When he comes in with that attitude, you're like, you know what?  Holy shit, he's going to fucking laugh at me.  I just throw it away and just go with it.  That was great.  As soon as he went, who's going to take a shit?  Yeah.  I was like, this guy's great.  Right on.  He's really trying to sell the car. 
[03:54:30]  There it is.  I'm looking at it right here.  It wasn't really supposed to be in the movie.  That's where he parked that day, which is another good.  And he says he's his, what, a mannequin in the trunk dressed like a police officer.  And you can buy the car that was in Reservoir Dogs when he goes outside to get the gasoline  from his actual car that he drove to the set that day.  It's up on eBay.  How much is it going for right now?  $68.50.  Right now, $68.50?  What does he want?  That's a bargain.  And he goes, as he's leaving, he's like, can you push the car? 
[03:55:00]  I really need to unload.  Unload, I need, this is why I have no doubt in my mind that that guy's actually killed  somebody.  Just how he talks, he goes, I really need to unload that car.  Could you like.  Unload.  He used the words like unload.  Yeah.  Could you give that a plug when you go back in the air?  I really need to unload this baby.  He should take it to the car crusher place that the wolf goes to.  How much does he want?  I'd buy that car if it was.  Yeah, it's $68.50. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, but he's not going to accept $68.50.  No, it says reserve, not met.  What's the, oh, is that a hidden reserve?  Yeah, it looks like a hidden reserve.  You got to think he wants, he's hoping for 100 Gs.  Yeah, probably.  I bet you he wants 100 Gs for that car.  Minimum.  That is a.  What's that on?  What website?  It's a famous car.  eBay.  It's eBay?  The auction only has 11 hours left, but he's not going to get his, what he's hoping for.  It's a famous car.  No.  Let's see, I've never wrecked the car all electric work.  She had a peach in her hand that had a beer with a straw. 
[03:56:00]  I'm just going to go home and just talk like this all weekend.  It'd be great to be able to talk like that.  Then maybe my girl will think of me as a man.  It's cool when you push food in the girl's face.  I'm going to fuck you.  Jesus Christ.  God bless him.  Well, you know what?  You really shouldn't do radio, any more radio after something like that.  No, that to be completely honest with you. 
[03:56:30]  But I'll say this much.  Big A's been waiting.  Fucking Tim in the other place had Big A sing his own theme song for when Big A comes in.  Yeah.  Listen to how creepy this is.  It's Big A.  We'll talk about this song a little more on Monday.  A little tease for a Monday or Tuesday show.  Tuesday show, I guess.  A song called The Intruder by Peter Gabriel. 
[03:57:00]  Sung by Big A.  I know something about opening windows and doors.  I know how to move quietly to creep across creaky wooden floors.  I know where to find you sleeping. 
[03:57:30]  And I know that I can score.  Slipping the clippers.  The clippers through the telephone wire.  Oh, that is cool.  Slipping the clippers.  Slipping the clippers.  Slipping the clippers.  Slipping the clippers. 
[03:58:00]  Slipping the clippers.  Slipping the clippers.  Slipping the clippers.  Slipping the clippers.  Holy shit.  Is that creepy?  Yeah, because he got like louder and...  I know.  Something about...  Anything he does like that, I just picture him hacking up a woman.  Oh, absolutely.  Just full of blood with an oldie time butcher's apron on.  And just swinging a meat cleaver with no feeling or emotion in his face. 
[03:58:30]  One of the lines is from this week.  I don't remember it exactly, but we're talking about Big A at the Playboy Mansion.  I believe it was Jimmy talking about him.  What, ripping the hooker's hair out?  Yeah, with a whole scalp.  Playboy bunny.  Yeah.  The part of her scalp.  No, she can't.  You just hear her whimpering in the grotto.  Looking for her scalp.  Because she wants to still be in Playboy.  What a visual.  What a great week of radio.  He is so scary.  A lot of fun. 
[03:59:00]  A lot of fun.  Yeah, fuck you and your mother if you don't agree.  We're going to do line of the day.  That's a great show.  Don Wicklin, everybody.  Don, why don't you grab that.  What mic is that over there?  Oh, Wickie's here.  Don.  That interview sucked.  All right, whatever.  I think the guy's joking.  Yeah.  Don, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie.  Oh, wow.  And I'm actually standing there.  Stepping out of character.  All right.  I want to thank you for a fine night of dining last night. 
[03:59:30]  Wow.  I'm writing this one down.  Son of a bitch.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm impressed.  Without a joke.  But as soon as I sit down, I go back to Opie.  Back to being Opie.  Yes.  No, it was amazing in the end.  It was good.  When I fully understood what was going on three hours into the dinner.  How come some people never see the actor that plays Opie?  No, it was terrific.  And I forgot we weren't supposed to talk about it on the air because you've been trying 
[04:00:00]  to hide this from ELO.  No, it doesn't matter.  No.  I saw a credit card.  You've got to take some money.  Do you know how much your dinner was?  From who?  Just take it.  Can I guess?  I told Ronnie.  Can I guess?  Hold on.  I'm going to guess too, but let me set this up.  Hold on.  Until Ronnie, this experience has to be, there were six of us, has to be $500 a person.  Perhaps more than that. 
[04:00:30]  Not counting the taxes, tip and all that.  Just like the basic, you want to do this, it's going to cost $500 a head.  No, I think more than that.  I think more than that.  I think it's less.  I think you are low balling.  I think it's less than that.  Really?  A little less.  Not too much, but a little less than that.  You could go out.  Or you have to pay for the table as a whole.  So maybe it's a table for a whole eight people.  Yeah, because they're not charging by little.  You've got to charge.  It's probably one lump sum.  Dude, they're stopping cooking for the real restaurant to come over and give you time too.  So, I'm going to guess, five G's, not counting if you're going to buy wine or, yeah, and tip and stuff. 
[04:01:00]  So five G's.  Five G's.  For just the food.  Wait, no, 500 a person I said, right?  You said four.  No, I said 500 a person, I'm sorry.  500 a person.  Three G's, three G's.  Anthony, what are you going?  I'm going probably seven ahead.  Seven?  Yeah.  A hundred ahead.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to go.  I should have been in math. 
[04:01:30]  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go 40, 42, 1.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  Price is right rules.  42, 1.  You stink.  I'm going 42, 1.  You're that woman that does that.  I'm going 42, 1, Bob.  Go hump Bob Barker's leg.  I'd like to spin the wheel.  Who's the closest?  You'll never know.  Oh, he's not going to tell.  What a cliffhanger.  That means it was, that means it was $7,000.  Yeah.  And he wants us to think that he actually, you know.  Oh, sorry. 
[04:02:00]  Did you have a good time?  I'm being great.  Did you have a good time?  Sorry.  I'll just show.  That's all that matters.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Thanks so much.  Oh yeah, that's right.  I didn't go.  Ooh.  That was Don's call, man.  That's all I need.  No, that's all I need.  All right.  Listen, now let's get really uncomfortable.  We can't end this terrific week this way.  Or yeah, we can actually.  FH Raleigh's this weekend, 400 New York Avenue. 
[04:02:30]  Doing a Long Island visit.  You should give the chef's table away at FH Raleigh.  Yes.  It's not a bad idea.  You should do one.  My brother does a fine job.  What was I going to say?  Oh, we got to get Big A to...  We're going to do the line of the day and get the fuck out of here?  Yeah, but Big A...  We got to get Big...  I got shit to do.  I got to be places.  That's why you didn't get invited.  I got gambling to do.  Yeah, you're going to the Atlantic City?  Yep.  Big A has got to sing that whole song.  He's got to sing the whole song.  Don't you think?  Yeah. 
[04:03:00]  The whole song.  Sure.  Of Intruder.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe we could do it here or something.  He should do it with pig's blood in his mouth.  I know.  All right, anyway...  Come down, seeing if...  What?  Seeing if Marissa could get me in trouble by calling the dealer a cunt again.  Yeah.  Did she really?  Yeah.  That's a great situation to be in.  Why'd she call her a cunt?  She was being a cunt.  But it's the dealer.  And yeah, Marissa thought it would be a good time to go, well, you're a fucking cunt.  Nice. 
[04:03:30]  I love you, girl.  And I stand up, and the first thing I do is pull out my black card, and I'm going, do  you know who the fuck I am?  Just trying to, like, calm everything down.  And security came over and threw us out of the casino.  Did she read and go, Anthony Kukumia?  Yeah.  Kukumia?  It was actually really funny being thrown out of a casino for calling the dealer a cunt.  That's funny.  Hoping to relive that moment.  Yeah.  Which ancestor changed her name from Kamiya to Kumiya?  I've always wanted to answer that.  It wasn't Kamiya.  But it's spelled Kumiya.  It's Kumiya.  Kumiya.  Kumiya. 
[04:04:00]  It means Kumiya in Italian.  Believe me.  Growing up, when you'd spell the name out, the first three letters, C-U-M-A, get it?  It's Kumiya.  Yeah.  Great.  I get it.  Kumiya.  Yeah.  Kumiya.  Kumiya.  Kumiya.  Kumiya.  Kumiya.  There's a little town in Sicily, I believe, named Kumiya.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I have no idea if they were from there or just stole the name or what.  They must just jack off a lot in that town.  Yeah.  The blacks. 
[04:04:30]  It's just jacking.  It's known, and Kumiya, the town is known, it's known that all the people, it means town  of the huge cock.  Instead of tomatoes, they jerk off and flick cum at each other.  That's their greeting.  Their Italian greeting.  That's their Alfredo sauce.  A big parade.  A big parade.  They jerk off and then Spider-Man each other in the face.  Kumiya.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do this Ski Colorado thing.  They're great advertisers.  SkiColoradoNow.com. 
[04:05:00]  Right, Don?  Radio.  They're amazing.  Yeah.  If I have to read some bullshit because you took us out to dinner, I'm going to fucking  kick your ass.  This is on the up and up, but I'm going to be very suspicious of the next sponsor that  comes on board.  Mmm.  You're going to be reading a lot of spots.  Yeah.  Somewhere line of the day sponsored by ginsu or something.  I was trying for a cooking joke.  That was the best thing to come up with.  Ginsu?  What the fuck is ginsu?  I don't know.  The ginsu knives? 
[04:05:30]  Ginsu.  Ginsu.  Oh, see?  You mix ginseng and fucking ginsu together.  Fucking Don had to tell me to not steal the forks, by the way.  You should have took one.  I only have...  I have two forks in my apartment.  Opie.  You had ten chances.  Opie, you had...  And you blew it.  You had fucking money.  I have...  You get to go to your ATM and look at your balance and a smile immediately pairs on your  face.  Okay?  You cannot not smile looking at your fucking balance.  Go buy a fork.  I have two.  Two?  Swear to God.  What's wrong with you?  I've been trying to figure that out for years, Bobby. 
[04:06:00]  Dude, just give your girl your credit card and have her go to Bed Bath & Beyond and get  some shit.  The Macy's?  My mom made us very nervous about money my entire life.  How?  If you really want to do a little therapy, let's go.  Ask me a question.  What did you...  How many people grew up in your house?  Officially, we had seven kids, but there was always more.  So, say, eight kids?  Nine?  Sometimes eight, sometimes nine.  How many forks did you have?  If you count the boyfriend that was living in our attic for a while on the QT...  Your boyfriend was living in the attic? 
[04:06:30]  Fuck you.  My sister's boyfriend, we thought the house was haunted.  We thought we had ghosts.  That's funny.  No joke, because we heard fucking noises in the attic.  He set up a whole apartment in our attic.  Not an apartment apartment, but a place to sleep and hang.  Fucking creepy.  Swear to God.  And then my...  You know, we're scared of ghosts and we think the house is haunted.  My dad went up there to check out the scene and I found a boyfriend.  And it wasn't a one-day thing.  He was living... 
[04:07:00]  We don't know officially how long he lived up there, but he lived up there for a while.  So, in the middle of the night you heard, yeah, yeah.  All right.  All right.  I thought that was a ghost.  All right.  There's a ghost having sex in our attic.  He's not going boo.  No, he's going poo-hoo.  Listen to me.  What?  I don't understand why you only have fucking two forks.  It's weird.  I know.  You live in a high-rise.  Yeah.  With a doorman. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  On the west side of Manhattan.  Yeah.  Probably one of the most expensive real estate areas in the world.  Yeah.  And you own it.  Yeah.  You live with a hot...  She's an 11.  Oh, yeah.  And you have two forks.  Yeah.  You have one bowl.  You can't both eat cereal at the same time.  Trying to eat it with a fork, no spoons.  Yeah.  You can never get the milk in the fucking thing.  You have to just drink the milk at the end like a fucking cat.  And then I'm too lazy to like clean the two forks so half the time I'm eating from the... 
[04:08:00]  I'm using the takeout forks that just happen to be piling up.  Plastic ones.  Yeah.  Break.  That's your salt and pepper too, the little packets.  Right.  You actually use a fucking spork.  I got things to figure out still, Bob.  What can I tell you?  Why don't you just today go to the fucking store?  And you know what?  You can just go...  I went to...  What is it?  Bed Bath & Beyond, I think it's called.  Yeah.  It's perfect.  Pick up some Beyond.  Yeah.  And I started looking at forks and I pretty much had a panic attack because now I'm like, 
[04:08:30]  oh, fuck.  Which fork do you buy?  The blue one.  It doesn't even matter.  Dude, you just buy a silver fork.  One with prongs.  No, they were too fancy for me.  I just...  Fancy at Bed Bath & Beyond?  Dude, fucking Bed...  Go there.  Go there today.  Alright.  They have cheap stuff throughout the whole store.  I won't go to Atlantic City.  I'll spend my day in Bed Bath & Beyond.  It'd be cheaper.  Do you have forks?  Yeah, but he doesn't...  Stone Age?  The fuck?  Of course I got forks. 
[04:09:00]  Yeah, but I hear you don't have much furniture or couches or anything.  I'm working on it.  I got couches and chairs, but they're in the dining room.  They were getting in the way of the guns.  Because the living room is full of computer equipment.  He has a chair made of AKs.  Dude, if you ever wondered how a college kid, let's say, would live because he hit the  lotto, come on over to either my house or his house.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  We're just like college kids that hit the lottery.  Oh, cool.  That would be sick. 
[04:09:30]  Toys and no furniture.  Right.  That's pretty much it.  My priorities are fucked up.  There's a Mets beanbag chair in front of the fireplace.  I shit you not.  Do you have a fucking beanbag?  There's a Mets beanbag chair.  You can do green screen videos.  Yeah, yeah.  Downstairs I have a green screen, lighting, video.  I just bought some new Lowell lights, microphones.  I can do anything I want, but I can't sit down in my living room.  You can recreate Star Wars in your basement. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah, I got all the software I need for my computers, huge monitors, things like that.  I got a plasma television and a big loungy chair in my dining room to play Call of Duty on.  You have no dining room table?  No, there's no dining room table because the living room furniture is in there.  Where do you eat?  In the kitchen where there's an island.  You eat in an island?  Yeah.  Or I eat at the computer.  There's something wrong with you.  There's something wrong with you.  How old are you?  You're almost fucking 58.  I'm not at all. 
[04:10:30]  Don't put me in that boss fucking age bracket.  Dude, you got it.  You're over 40.  Yeah, I am.  30, 32.  But you know what it is?  How old are you?  It's very difficult.  Bobby, let me tell you something.  What?  We gave you a lot of room today, but you got to now relax and reel it in a little bit.  You're a little too cocky.  You're acting like one of the guys here.  I don't like this.  First of all, I am one of the guys.  Go fuck yourself.  I don't like this.  They both look like you fucking the lead singers for Air Supply.  So fuck off.  I don't like this.  You don't like it.  You're taking some chances today, Bobby.  Check this out. 
[04:11:00]  Buy a fork and it won't happen.  Fuck you and fuck the Cleveland improv.  Fucking relax with that.  Don't you fuck with it.  I need furniture.  You got to fuck you money.  I don't.  I live in a one bedroom.  I got two stairs.  I hear it's lovely though.  It is a very nice room.  It's not a fucking tower.  By the way, Don spent about two grand on dinner.  Okay.  From Ontario.  It's right on the website, Don.  Oh.  Oh shit.  Oh.  Face.  I thought it was worth more than two G's.  Oh.  Oh fucking ingrate. 
[04:11:30]  Oh.  Anthony, I apologize.  Next time.  Thank you, Don.  Fuck Opie.  You would get the thanks that you so duly deserve.  Thank you.  For all I've done for you.  I didn't do shit.  I told you this last night.  You haven't done shit.  What did Missy say last night?  She was hilarious because of something.  We were talking about stress.  She goes, oh, thanks.  Now you're telling me this?  What was it?  How old you look now?  Oh no.  Yeah.  Don had to say that I've aged 10 years in the last year. 
[04:12:00]  Jesus Christ.  That was really nice of him.  What the fuck was it?  Ah, whatever.  It'll come to me on another show.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info and great deals on 26 world class resorts.  Up to the minute snow conditions.  You do this.  You log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here's a runner up line of the day.  But he kept leaning over and like hat coughing on the other people.  Oh no.  Did he have that big rape vein on his forehead?  That's incredible. 
[04:12:30]  Bobby's got a lot of things going on in his career.  He's got the improv starting Wednesday in Cleveland.  Yep.  Wednesday through Sunday.  He's got a DVD coming out.  CD coming out.  CD, DVD coming out.  Comedy Central special.  April, April 4th and April 8th, yeah.  And I was at that taping and now I gotta be Greg Hughes again.  Was I like nothing but...  Yeah.  Right?  We hugged and stuff.  I was very excited for you.  Yeah, it was a great day.  I was glad you're here.  I always invite you to my stuff because you know why?  You show up.  You're very supportive.  Oh no, you didn't.  Very supportive. 
[04:13:00]  You know, I could say...  I didn't say anything, dude.  I didn't say anything.  You said because you show up.  No, he shows up.  Implying that I don't show up.  No, I don't wanna...  You know, it's a long...  Dude, it's a long trip from Long Island into Manhattan sometimes.  Especially for someone he barely gives a shit about.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I've done...  I've showered Robert with praise of his comedy.  I've done this at every turn and yet I get shit like I never come out to see you. 
[04:13:30]  Nah, I invited you to my wedding, didn't I?  You're right.  I don't.  Yes.  I did both of you guys.  But yeah.  And there was no thank you.  Honestly...  I feel bad.  As soon as Bobby was done, it's gotta be said the place stood up immediately and gave  you a standing ovation, man.  Yeah.  It's gonna be a great...  I hope they filmed it properly and all that.  I hope they edited it, yeah.  Yeah, fuck Jane Seymour and fuck her birthday.  Thank you.  Thank you, Matt Man from Boston.  Never forget! 
[04:14:00]  My mom wanted a dumb autograph from Jane Seymour as we're taking the NBC SNL tour or...  No, we were going to see Phil Donahue.  We were in the elevator with just us and Jane Seymour and my mom.  Eh, you know, a little nervous.  Yeah.  Holy shit, that's Jane Seymour.  Ma, go ask her for an autograph.  I'm just a kid.  Jane Seymour, there's no one around, goes nah.  Ugh.  And now we have to awkwardly take the elevator down with her.  Fuck Jane Seymour!  Oh, man.  Anyway, another runner-up line of the day. 
[04:14:30]  Well, you know...  Bobby, as a bisexual man...  Yes.  Would you have...  Wait a minute.  Wait a second.  You know, as you said that, it just slipped right past me and I didn't even question it.  I'm like, yeah, okay.  I just...  You fucking...  You fucking walked into that right hook.  It's just...  Oh, you.  That's so funny.  It's just getting goofy now, dude.  It's just getting goofy.  We love when we just get goofy.  Like, no one could possibly be listening to this.
