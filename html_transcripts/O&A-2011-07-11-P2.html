<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The After Opie and Anthony Live show, hosted by Sam Roberts with E-Rock and other staff present,  focused primarily on a recap of Opie and Anthony's raucous 4th of July party at Anthony Cumia's house.  Guests Roland, a publicist, and Troy were in studio to recount the events.  The partyâ€™s highlights centered largely around Roland's heavily intoxicated and inappropriate behavior.  This included a crude toast to Eric Nagel wishing him "some pussy tonight," an attempt to submerge a Macho Man Randy Savage action figure in fondue, and offensive remarks directed at a waitress.  In contrast, Troy's participation was described as relatively subdued.  Eastside Dave's more boisterous actions were also mentioned, including a past incident where he nearly set Eric's wedding on fire.  The discussion also included details about Eric's own heavy drinking, specifically his three-day bender following the holiday. A humorous anecdote about Opie repeatedly ignoring Bobo's calls and keeping him on hold for an extended period was shared.  Troy briefly performed an impromptu rendition of Elvis Presley's "Burning Love." The show concluded with a discussion on the awkwardness of men's underwear shopping, specifically the discomfort of viewing images of muscular, shirtless men on packaging.  A caller, Craig, a personal trainer, affirmed this shared sentiment. The final moments included plugs for Ron & Fez and an upcoming Harry Potter movie viewing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, you guys just missed a party.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  We keep this channel live.  At this point, you're aware.  Anthony literally just walked out of the studio.  You just missed a big party.  Opie was here.  Bob Kelly was here.  Anthony was here.  We're talking about technology and podcasting and lighting and the compound. 
[00:00:30]  All kinds of exciting stuff.  It's the thing about this show.  It really teaches everybody that just because the mics are off doesn't mean the show isn't going on.  As a matter of fact, sometimes I just like to sit on the couch during commercial breaks  and pretend that they're doing a show for me.  E-Rock, sometimes you eavesdrop in this studio without them knowing,  so you could be a listener to the show as well, right?  No, I was in studio.  I heard everything.  I said sometimes, not this time.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[00:01:00]  Okay.  So that wasn't you mishearing me.  That was your way of avoiding the question.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Right.  You're making stuff up again.  Fair enough.  Okay.  Well, we are starting a new week, and this is a very exciting week  because a lot of people took the entire 4th of July week off,  and there's a whole new fresh energy here.  There's people walking around in the hallways.  Everybody is fresh, ready to go back to work, having a good time.  How much of that do you believe, Eric?  Oh, all of it. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, okay, good.  You are Mr. Company Man today.  Are we spinning the wheel?  What do you mean?  Oh, we're not doing that anymore?  No, we're not.  Where have you been the last week?  I guess I wasn't listening.  Well, I guess not.  Eric, that is long gone, the wheel spinning.  But today it was a big show.  Brian Cranston, maybe that's why everybody is so excited.  Brian Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle, from Breaking Bad, of course,  from Seinfeld, he was on the show today.  The thing that struck me about the show today, we're talking about guests, 
[00:02:00]  was Roland came in here, and he was really ready to eat a shit sandwich  the minute he walked in.  Like, they had Opie and Anthony specifically, and I guess this is since his  breakdown on the air a month or so ago, but Opie and Anthony had to specifically  say, Roland, you don't have anything to worry about.  Is he around, Eric?  What are you doing back there, Eric?  I can see you in the monitor.  You're not around anymore.  What are you doing?  The phone was ringing.  What do you mean?  The office phone? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Well, who was it?  It was Derek in production.  What did he have to say?  He was telling me about some stuff that we have in there, what we should run  and what we shouldn't...  From now on, I mean, if those phones ring, feel free to turn a mic on  and just say, hey, there's a phone ringing right now.  Well, that's...  The problem is that when I pick up, I never know, like, what's going to be  said, blurted out right off the bat.  So what you do is, from now on, if that phone rings, flip the mic on,  then when you pick up the phone, just say, sex bagel, you're on the air.  Just see what...  All right, well, then say Eric Nagel, and then say, you're on the air. 
[00:03:00]  Maybe.  Try it.  I think it'll work out.  Hi, Roland, you're on the air.  No, I say when the phone rings, not just...  I'll take care of the people coming in the studio.  Roland, you were ready this morning.  They brought you in.  Why did they...  Oh, to ask why Adam Sandler hadn't done the show.  Yeah, I came back from a food run, so I didn't know what they were talking about.  All I heard was, Adam Sandler, why isn't he doing the show?  And you had this expression on your face, like, oh, shit, what is this now?  I'm like, am I going to get thrown under the bus?  What is going to happen? 
[00:03:30]  That's what I went back to explain from the beginning and forth, and what's going on.  Do you get nervous when they start making fun of movies?  Yeah.  Especially ones that haven't come out yet?  Well, like, the ones that brought up the change-up to deflect it.  It didn't work, though, did it?  No, they're fantastic, though, because they're not getting impressed.  Oh!  See?  So, you saw them smashing the Adam Sandler movie, so you figure, if I bring up the change-up,  they'll just focus on that movie, and we're not getting either of those Ryan Reynolds or Jason Bateman anyway.  Correcto Mundo.  But you do think that the change-up looks good. 
[00:04:00]  I actually don't think it looks...  Well, I don't think it looks that horrible.  It looks like the Kirk Cameron movie with Doug Lee Moore.  Yeah.  Except some piss jokes instead.  Yeah, and caca jokes.  Yeah, some piss and shit jokes thrown in.  It's, uh, like, vice versa.  Yeah.  You know, it's...  That's why I threw that movie up, because I had to make fun of Adam Sandler, because it  is working on it, so I'm like, ah, throw this under the bus.  What are you...  Did you see the Adam Sandler trailer?  Hysterical.  You thought it would be...  You think...  It's going to make hundreds of millions of dollars.  I didn't ask you how much money it was going to make. 
[00:04:30]  I asked if you had seen the trailer.  I wish there was a screening tomorrow.  And you would go see it.  100%.  What's it called?  Jack and Jill?  Yeah.  And you think it looks funny?  It looks hilarious.  Roland, you're professional.  I'll give you that.  It's like another Adam Sandler, like a twist, where he plays two people in one movie.  And one thing you like in movies is twists.  I love twists.  I mean...  Suspense.  Right.  And you think there's suspense in the movie Jack and Jill.  Oh, yeah, because you're like, is he going to break character?  Is it...  You know what?  The fact that it's a film, not a play, and that they could retake anything means he's 
[00:05:00]  probably not going to break character.  He's not pretending to be a woman in the movie.  That's how good he is.  He's playing a woman.  That's fantastic.  If he broke character, they would just reshoot.  That's wonderful, too.  You like that.  I love it.  You like going in knowing this is a film, so if anyone breaks character, they'll reshoot it.  I didn't know that.  Yes.  I'm excited for it now.  I like Roland, too, because it all depends on if they're doing press or not.  Because you'll go to...  You'll just fall asleep in the movie. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, it's not like...  You won't lie about it.  You'll just say it was great.  Fantastic.  But you don't think it was bad.  You fell asleep, so you had a good time.  The parts I saw was wonderful.  Yeah.  I was also surprised, you know, while you're in here, Roland, that it took this long.  It's like Ant's pool party.  We were talking about it.  It was on July 4th.  That's a week ago already.  Yeah.  Finally, we get to hear some of what happened at the party.  Recovery time.  Is that what it was?  The brain cells start rebuilding. 
[00:06:00]  It happens.  And the memory comes back.  I have to see the best of us.  It's delicious.  Booze does that to you.  Is that how you describe booze?  Delicious?  It's delicious.  You, seeing Springsteen, you came in here to panic.  I don't see.  Oh, yeah.  I guess none of us, when we were actually at the party, understood what you were saying  on stage.  Because I don't remember you saying anything inappropriate.  But you came in like, all right, we should turn that off.  At the very end, I said something inappropriate.  Anthony, like, high-fiving.  Yeah.  What did the word start with? 
[00:06:30]  Nagel.  Okay.  Well, that's enough said.  Eric, were you nervous about the karaoke being on the air?  No.  Not at all.  How come you didn't?  See, the way it was set up was we all ended up in the karaoke room.  Like, there was the cool kids at the party were down in the karaoke room.  Everybody sang.  I sang.  Roland sang.  Eastside Dave sang.  Jess sang.  Ant sang.  Danny sang.  I don't know if, I don't think I saw a D-boy sing. 
[00:07:00]  I don't know.  I wasn't down there for most of it.  And Travis wasn't even there.  How come Travis wasn't there?  I don't know.  Hmm.  Well, he, I mean, I'm sure, I would hope that he would have sang.  But you, Eric, you were the one guy who refused to come down.  At first, you know, obviously you eventually did.  But at first, you refused to come down to the karaoke room.  Eh, because I don't do that.  Can they want you to see I Want Your Sex?  Yeah, that's what we were trying to set up.  You singing I Want Your Sex. 
[00:07:30]  See, that would have been funny.  Bagel.  You don't think that's funny?  Nah.  Why don't you do that stuff when everybody else is?  I don't know.  I just, I doubt, I think that was the first time I've ever done karaoke.  It is?  Yeah.  But like, if everybody there is doing it, all your co-workers are there singing songs  and stuff, it's like, you're not going to get made fun of for doing what everybody else  is doing.  So what was it that was holding you back?  Eh, I don't know.  I just didn't, I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  Probably because I wasn't drinking.  You don't like putting yourself out there.  I don't have to.  I love booze.  Yeah.  Eric has a problem.  He doesn't like putting himself out there.  Roland, on the other hand, likes booze.  It's delicious.  He likes alcohol.  Roland hung at the bar almost the entire time there.  He had to be from like, instead of walking everywhere.  Yeah, but you could drink and walk away, not drink it down and put it right back under  the tap.  It wasn't.  It was in his backyard.  It wasn't like it was like a bar full of people that you had to push through. 
[00:08:30]  It was his backyard.  You would have to take three steps.  It was so cold and delicious, I just couldn't stop.  He couldn't leave.  You had to drink quick before the ice melt and then get in a refill?  Yeah, I lost count.  How was this weekend for you?  Not too bad.  I haven't drank in a week.  Why?  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  Are you trying to hold back?  No.  Because people are like, you drink a lot.  No, I don't.  Oh, so this is one of those things where technically you are an alcoholic, but you're  trying to go for a week without drinking so you can prove you're not and then go back 
[00:09:00]  to having the problem.  Yeah, until I picked Betty Ford.  That's what happens.  Yeah.  I can quit for a week if I want to.  Yeah, you're dead.  I'm alive.  Well, Betty Ford passed away over the weekend.  She was 93.  So I don't think that that was you winning.  Face.  You do, on the other hand.  I win.  You didn't drink at all this weekend?  Did I hear that right?  Yeah.  That's what he said.  He said he hasn't drank in a week.  I drank all three days.  Eric, how come you drank?  What were you doing that you drank all three days? 
[00:09:30]  Friday night I was out and I was doing tequila shots.  Where were you?  I was out at a concert.  Tequila shots was in 1985?  Hey, Silver Patron is very good.  Doing tequila shots at a concert?  Who is this, Eric?  And then Saturday I was out in Long Island for a party and I was drinking there.  Where?  It was just somebody's house party out there.  Well, if you're drinking, that means it's a party. 
[00:10:00]  Back from where I used to live.  And what were you drinking?  Oh, yeah, right.  What were you drinking on Saturday?  Saturday was mostly beer.  Okay.  Like Corona.  And then Sunday went to the, Roland may know this place.  It's called the Standard Beer Garden.  Oh, yes.  Oh, I've heard of it.  I was there for eight hours.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you drink around your friends from work, Eric?  Yeah, because we see how well that works.  Why?  Because, well, you obviously enjoy imbibing every now and then. 
[00:10:30]  It's been a long time since I've done this.  But you did it three days in a row.  I know.  I don't, I wasn't paying attention.  See, that's how I felt.  You lost focus.  Oh, my God.  The beer garden was horrible.  What happened?  And just, because you got to buy these tickets in order to buy the beer at the, you know,  at the bar there.  Sure.  So, after, I think, two, and these are huge German-style beers, I just threw my credit  card down.  I just kept seeing tickets coming flying to me. 
[00:11:00]  You're going for it.  How come you don't drink around your work friends?  Like, how come you didn't drink at Ant's Party?  Because I was driving everybody.  I couldn't.  Yeah.  Well, you got drunk before at Houlihan's.  That's when I knew I had a problem.  Like, I wasted at Houlihan's.  You did or he did?  I did, but he drank, too.  Oh.  When was that?  A while ago.  Oh.  Yeah, but Roland drinks strawberry mojitos.  Well, I saw him at a, wasn't it, was that your birthday party or your wife's?  Uh, no, that was my birthday.  Yeah, at Eric's birthday party, Roland made it. 
[00:11:30]  You were shit-faced, and it wasn't even an hour into the dinner.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  The waitress stopped coming by the table.  Oh, yeah.  This is how classy Roland is.  And by the way, my fiancÃ©e, Jess, was absolutely horrified at Roland's behavior.  She got mad at you, though.  Well, yeah, because I was egging him on, obviously, but I was like, look, this is what I did.  Big Kev hit me, too.  Big Kev didn't like you.  I think that anybody who finds, like, I don't know, I think most of the time drunk people  are funny, but there's always, like, Big Kev and girls find drunk people obnoxious. 
[00:12:00]  Now, if Roland was doing that, like, say we were at a bar or at a concert or some kind  of bigger setting, that would have been fine.  No.  But the fact that we were in this, it's sort of upscale, but small restaurant.  It was this nice, yeah, it was a small restaurant, and so all the tables are close to each other.  Oh, yeah.  It was fondue, so it was like, you know, it was a classy establishment, and on the water  and everything.  It was a place where you'd wear a shirt to. 
[00:12:30]  And who is, somebody was giving Eric a birthday toast.  I can't, don't say, don't, don't, let me tell, Eric, who was giving you your birthday toast  before Roland jumped in?  Or no, maybe it was you.  No, it was Angela, I think.  No, I think, Eric, I think it was you thanking everybody for coming out.  And then, Roland.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Eric, I just said thanks to everybody, and that was the last I said.  And then Eric is sitting next to his wife, and Roland picks up his glass and says, 
[00:13:00]  Here, here, Eric, may you get some pussy tonight.  And he just screams it out, basically right in Eric's wife's face.  And Jess, I'm dying laughing.  I'm crying.  Tears are streaming down my face.  And Jess is looking at me like, How dare you encourage this behavior?  But I said, And this was like the beginning of the night.  Eric, what?  Do you remember somebody had given me a toy for my birthday? 
[00:13:30]  And Roland was looking at it and trying to put it into the pot that was melting everything.  Wasn't that your Macho Man Randy Savage action figure?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody gave Big Kev or Big Kev's friend Matt, also from Big Kev's Geek Stuff, I think,  gave Eric a Macho Man Randy Savage action figure.  It was a special edition one.  You don't have to justify it, Eric.  I own it myself.  But Eric had to eventually hide it somewhere because Roland kept grabbing it and trying 
[00:14:00]  to dip it in the cheese and the oils.  I forget.  Specifically trying to bend the box because Eric was trying to keep it collectible.  But Eric, did you get in trouble from your wife when Roland yelled in her face, Here,  here, Eric, may you get some pussy tonight?  No, because my wife adores Roland.  Not at that night she did not.  She was upset?  She wasn't happy that night.  I think I stole something from the bathroom. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  I had something in my pocket.  I was like, Where did this come from?  Roland, you can back me up on this one.  Eric's wife was not happy with you that night.  She likes you in general, but that night she was, no way was she happy with you.  Like, the blur visions I have of everybody's faces.  Yeah, just giving you dirty looks.  I was oblivious of what people are.  And then, poor Big Kev, who's there hanging out, he went to the bathroom in the beginning  of the night.  Oh, yeah.  And he was in the bathroom for like 15 minutes.  No, it's dirty, dude.  Okay, so everybody at the table knows what's going on. 
[00:15:00]  Like, you know why you're in the bathroom for 30 minutes.  So he walks back, he sits down, and Roland goes, Hey, buddy, what were you, taking a shit?  Hey, Sam.  And then I go, I'm going, I'm going, Roland, what are you doing this?  And Roland screams at the top of his line, What's wrong, Sam?  He's taking a shit!  Yes, Eric?  I was wasted.  No, I just spoke to her.  No, she was not, she didn't have a problem.  She was not horrified or anything like that.  That's bullshit.  Her and Ope's wife were horrified for the waitress because of the way Roland was treating 
[00:15:30]  her because he kept making these really inappropriate and very sexually aggressive comments to her.  That's what they were horrified about, but the toast was fun.  Well, I'm sure you, the audience, here on the after show, after Ope and Anthony Live,  you guys know, from Roland, from Ope and Anthony, you know he's not the king of subtlety.  He's either mumbling or he's horribly inappropriate. 
[00:16:00]  The touch of my pee-pee line made his head a few times.  Yeah, and guess what?  When Roland drinks too much, it's just horribly inappropriate.  I totally forgot about that.  You were drunk.  Yeah, I drank so much.  I think everybody was paying like $150 per couple.  I paid like $275 for my bar bill.  Yeah, he was just like throwing down hundreds like, here, I owe it.  You'd get, you know, nine strawberry mojitos.  Twelve, I think.  Twelve, taking shots. 
[00:16:30]  He had something that was mixed with orange juice.  Oh, yeah, that's delicious.  It had some really weird name that was exclusive to that place, and he just kept ordering that  and then saying the name after he ordered it.  But, I mean, people underestimate, if you want somebody to bring the party, invite Roland.  You got it.  And give him some booze.  Once you get Roland all boozed up, he's got, I mean, no sort of filter on anything.  Like, he will immediately just start saying things.  Like, all you have to do is whisper to Roland, hey, go tell that guy he's a moron. 
[00:17:00]  And then Roland just turns, hey, you fucking moron!  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  He doesn't care.  Like, I'm the social assassin.  Yeah, you're just, you're there to, you're there to make people laugh, even if it means  severing other relationships.  It happens.  You know, you don't know what's going to happen on a night with Roland.  Yeah, I know Jess was very upset, though.  She was.  I mean, Jess.  She ended up being drunk that she goes, why?  Hmm?  I remember her giving me a hug goodbye. 
[00:17:30]  She looked at me.  She goes, why?  Because she likes you as a person, but your behavior that night was completely appalling.  See, that's why Anthony had to say to bear in that hard liquor.  See, that's where your mistake was.  Anthony's party was the place to throw down.  Like, you should have gone and just gotten fucked up immediately.  Like, you should have been the guy.  Roland was rotating between the grill for the wings and the shish kebab stuff.  And then he's like, oh, I don't have anything to drink. 
[00:18:00]  So he'd go back downstairs and stand behind the tap for a while.  Roland, what did you have to say about Danny at that party?  Delicious grill master.  He was the grill master.  Roland kept repeating that.  Like, middle of conversation.  We're talking about something completely different.  Having a social conversation.  And, of course, it goes back to food for Roland.  Anytime there's a pause, but you guys got to admit Danny's the grill master tonight.  And we're all going, yeah, I mean, we're all enjoying the food, but we're trying to discuss things.  Yeah, but it's really good.  There was one point where my wife was talking with Joe DeRosa, and I'm just standing next 
[00:18:30]  to them.  And Roland comes over and goes, have you had the wings?  I'm like, no.  And then he goes, how did you not have the wings?  Like, you'd get all upset.  Yeah, but Roland, why didn't you go for hard liquor at Ant's house?  Because if the first time there was going to be polite, then second time.  Oh, there is no polite.  Well, see, I just didn't want to go too crazy.  So the second time, if I go back, I'll go for the hard booze.  Yeah.  Roland didn't go hard.  Troy didn't go hard.  Troy shit the bed at the party.  He did nothing.  Next time, a pregame in the car. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, that's the type of behavior I'm looking for.  And then Troy said he was going to come.  Troy's a pussy.  You didn't think, you thought his behavior was completely.  Yeah, Troy's like, ooh, I'm going to do, shut up, Troy.  You're not going to do nothing.  Yeah.  Because he's like.  He slept on the way there.  Yeah, he's sleeping on the way there.  We're doing karaoke, and he's in the pool.  Are you going to get you here?  I'm just kidding.  No, you weren't, Roland.  Yes, I was.  I just want to see him run here.  Like.  No, but Troy, though, we both, like, it was the first time we were invited, so. 
[00:19:30]  You didn't, like, Troy, you didn't throw down throw down at Ant's Party.  Well.  Like, I was just telling Roland that.  If you throw down, then you have to be there until, like, 2, 4 in the morning.  You have to, well, you have to be willing to do that.  But, like, Roland said, he went there, and he was more sticking to beer instead of hard liquor, and I was like, that's, the compound's not the place.  Well, the last thing you want to do when Anthony was cool enough to invite us out there to his party is to act like a total fucking asshole the first day you're there.  You know what I mean?  So, it was like, it was just wanted to be chill, just wanted to feel it out. 
[00:20:00]  No, that wasn't what it was about.  I mean.  Well, what's it about?  Like, you have to go be a, like, trash the fucking place?  If you're going to be the guy who's doing, like, you were talking.  But why do I have to be that guy?  Because that's how you were talking before.  Because I was the one that was drunk the first, and I jumped in the pool, and nobody else jumped in the pool.  Right, because you were.  And I look at you, I'm like, yo, come on.  And then, of course, Eastside Dave talks so much fucking shit.  Eastside Dave was the one who stayed for the party.  I had to leave because Eric was my ride.  You could have crashed an ant like Eastside Dave did.  I had studio stuff to do early in the morning. 
[00:20:30]  And he's like, I'm leaving now.  Mr. Party Animal has to do stuff early in the morning.  Sounds like a real crazy guy.  Oh, I don't have other shit going on.  I don't have other shit going on.  Because guess who Eastside Dave's ride was?  Who?  Eric.  He said, fuck it, I'm staying.  Well, that's great for him.  Because I came to party.  And then later, there were photos of him really close to Andy Levy in the hot tub.  But it didn't look like Dave was wearing anything.  No, I mean, at one point, Dave, right after you left, he was trying to do whatever he could to get the party to the next level. 
[00:21:00]  Because, honestly, Dave was disappointed by you, Troy.  Because you said you were going to bring the party.  And when I was ready to bring it, I was having a good time.  I'm like, yo, let's get in the fucking pool.  Let's get crazy.  You jumped in the pool at like 6.15.  It was later than that, dude.  The sun was starting to set.  And I was like, let's fucking go in the pool.  And I was half in the bag already.  And Dave's like, oh, I'm going to go.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Then we were.  In Troy's defense, when he first invited you to a place, he can't bring them hard.  Yeah, and I'm not going to act like a total fucking asshole at Anthony's place. 
[00:21:30]  But we were all downstairs doing karaoke.  It's what we were all talking about on the show today.  That's where the party was.  Okay.  Well, I was outside hanging out with Bob Kelly.  So what?  See?  That wasn't where the party was.  Okay.  Well, I mean, Bob Kelly and I were having a good time, so.  And Dave, Eastside Dave, he brought his party game.  I didn't see shit from Eastside Dave.  Well, you laughed at 10.30.  Well, I didn't see anything.  So, I mean, when was it going to fucking happen?  Because you went home at 10.30.  Of course you didn't see anything.  Because my ride left.  So did Dave's, but he stayed.  But I had shit to do.  He was my ride.  Well, Dave had shit to do, too.  He was offering to drive me back in the city. 
[00:22:00]  It would have been a fucking nightmare to get back in the city.  Do you know what shit Dave had to do?  Nothing.  No, party is the answer.  Oh, okay.  He had to party.  And that's what he came there for.  You and the other are standing in the pool by yourself.  Yeah, what's up with that?  Eric's taking pictures of me and, uh, what the fuck?  I don't know why he's got those pictures on his phone, to tell you the truth.  You and a bathing suit.  You couldn't wait to tweet them.  There they are.  You like them, Roland?  No, just very uncomfortable.  Is it uncomfortable that those pictures are there on the TV?  Or is it uncomfortable that Eric has pictures of Troy in a bathing suit stored on his phone? 
[00:22:30]  No, it's fine.  It's not normal.  Yeah, I didn't think so either.  By the way, you whispered that, you know, into a microphone.  I whispered it away from the microphone.  Well, how did, how did you feel your, did you feel like your expectations of how far you  would go at Ant's party were met?  Well, I mean, like I said, I don't want to go too, too crazy.  I mean, I want to, I'd like to be invited back to a compound party because it was a fucking  awesome time.  This is what you guys need to understand. 
[00:23:00]  Like, Roland and Troy, you guys both need to understand that the guy who trashes the  compound, that's the guy who's going to be invited back.  Yeah, I don't really see that.  Dave's going to get invited to every party and he tried to burn down Eric's wedding.  Yeah.  The reason that Ant loves Dave, Eastside Dave, is because he tried to set Eric's wedding  on fire.  And he's like, I want that vibe.  Eric, did Eastside Dave try to set your wedding on fire?  That he did.  That's the vibe Ant wants at the compound.  Well, that's not what I really wanted to do the first time there. 
[00:23:30]  I mean, I work for Anthony's show, so I don't want to be a total fucking asshole and puke  on his carpet and, and fucking trash the place.  You know what I mean?  You should puke on his carpet.  You should have at least puked on the, somewhere on the outside.  All right.  Well, in the pool.  If Anthony's kind enough to invite me to another compound party, I'll go big.  I'll go, I'll go hard in the motherfucking paint.  That's what I'm trying to.  I wish people would go hard in the paint and Roland, you too.  No more of this, like, just... 
[00:24:00]  I will bring you, like, I brought you his party, Eric's party.  To Eric's party.  Yeah, because that's the thing.  Roland was more out of control at Eric's birthday party with Big Kev at some restaurant  than he was at the compound party.  Yeah, but you want, he, I understand what he's saying.  We don't want to act like total fucking assholes the first time there.  So he's like, these guys are not coming back.  No, but he's going to say these guys are not coming back because they were no fun.  Don't worry.  We'll be fun.  I hope so.  Because, you know, how many more chances are you going to get?  I don't know.  But I think it was a safer move that Roland and I took it easy. 
[00:24:30]  Because I was, if I got so wasted by a pool, I'll poop in the pool.  That's hilarious.  I get crazy, too.  If I drink alcohol, I get fucking loony.  That's what we were looking for.  Yeah, no, I don't think he was.  I don't really think he was.  Dave poured beer all over the karaoke stage.  He almost destroyed all the karaoke equipment.  I mean, at the end of the day...  It was all good, though.  At the end of the day, I really don't think Anthony wants a food...  You know, the big spread of food that he had?  I don't think he would think that was funny if Roland and I started fucking... 
[00:25:00]  We're loaded and we're winging cupcakes at each other.  That shit sounds hilarious to me.  I would never throw food because it's just too delicious.  Yeah, you'd be trying to catch it in your mouth.  You'd say, no, we can't let this go to waste.  You bet your sweet tits.  You know?  No, I mean, you know, think about what's funny.  What's a fun thing?  There's a fine line between funny and being a total obnoxious asshole.  Let's get to the line.  Well...  And let's go a little over it.  That wasn't a line that I was willing to tiptoe across...  Next time?  ...at the compound party.  Maybe, I don't know.  Next time, I'll drink seven mojitos before I enter the car. 
[00:25:30]  That's what I'm talking about, Roland.  That's the attitude I thought we were going to have going in.  Yeah, because, like, Eric's party, I remember bits and pieces.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know.  But Ant's party, you remember all of it.  Yeah, I do.  See, that's bullshit.  To me, that's disrespectful to Ant.  I'll bring it next time.  Okay, that's what I like to hear.  As long as you're willing to bring it next time, you know.  It's all good.  And Troy, I mean, you will bring it next time?  If he's kind enough to invite me out again, I'll bring it.  And Troy will bring it tomorrow at the 675 bar.  Well, you're not going to be all fucked up at the 675 bar. 
[00:26:00]  Or you'll enable other people to do so with some nice music.  Yes.  Right, okay.  That's right.  That's where you're DJing.  Do you think Opie's going to go to this Mets game with Bobo?  Hell no.  I don't think so, bro.  I don't think so.  You don't think it's going to happen, no.  And Bobo just fucking keeps calling and keeps calling.  You're the phone screener, so you're the guy.  Like, people don't know, and I even don't know sometimes, because they'll hang out before  the after show, but true or false, there are O&A radio shows where Opie doesn't even mention 
[00:26:30]  that Bobo's on hold, but he'll stay on hold the whole show.  The entire time.  And you can tell on the phone screening thing that we use, how long they're on, and it's  like three hours.  And the listeners never know.  Right.  Because he doesn't mention, he doesn't...  And then Opie hung up on him today, and then he calls back, and he's like, oh, my phone,  I had a bad signal.  And what did you inform him of?  Nothing.  I just put him back on hold.  Whatever.  You know what I mean?  If they want to take the call, go for it.  And then, that's another thing.  He was on hold.  None of us knew it.  Yeah.  None of us had any idea, because how long was he on hold for? 
[00:27:00]  About another, probably another hour and a half.  An hour and a half.  Yeah.  And he's sitting there, you know he's sitting in his house, yelling at his mom, saying, you  know, I'm on the phone, Mom!  Yeah.  But he's on hold for hours at a time.  And he's so sure that Opie's going to go to this game with him.  He is.  He thinks so.  He thinks it's going to happen.  What did you see, Ted?  Well, he says that he re-upped, and his friend gave him like six tickets to a section whatever 
[00:27:30]  towards the floor.  Like, really good seats.  But I think Opie's made it clear that, number one...  By the field?  Yeah.  First, second, third base home?  Who knows?  It's Bobo.  Probably a bad one.  I mean, I'm getting this information from Bobo.  But Opie's made it clear that, number one, he's not going to want to go to this game  with Bobo and six of his friends.  And number two, Opie wants up in the 500s if he's going with Bobo.  Like, Opie wants nosebleed seats if he's going to go with Bobo.  Now, either way, whatever seat he gets, you don't see it happening, Troy. 
[00:28:00]  I would love to hear that Opie went with Bobo to the game.  I don't see it happening, but I think if Opie did decide to go, he could have a lot of fun  with it.  Yeah.  Roland, you say no fucking way in hell, you said.  No, I don't think so.  Eric, you've spent a lot of time around Opie over the years.  You know him very well.  Yeah.  Will he go to this game?  I think he'll tell Bobo to meet him there and just not go.  Okay. 
[00:28:30]  And will that be, will his intentions be, yeah, I'll go, and then at the last minute  he'll decide not to, or will it be malicious from the start?  He just knows he's ditching him.  He'll give a list of snacks for Bobo to buy for him to have ready as well.  I know, just be Bobo sitting out in front of that big bat, just waiting for Opie.  I hope somebody takes a picture of him.  I would hope so.  When's the game?  Saturday.  Saturday afternoon.  Ooh.  The Ron and Fez interns are starting to set up.  It's very exciting.  Because tomorrow we're all going to see Harry Potter. 
[00:29:00]  Are you?  Yeah.  What time?  You can come.  We have an extra ticket.  What time?  Seven.  Uh, we'll see.  IMAX 3D.  Oh, maybe.  Um, somebody is actually feedbacking in asking if we can get a drunk Roland show one day on  the air.  Um.  I could do it for a Saturday for a special delivery.  I don't see why we couldn't.  Yeah, we could have Roland come in on special delivery one day, but.  I could go to my bar.  I always go to here.  My friend works.  I don't think, uh, doing that in the morning would work because Roland has to work throughout  the rest of the day. 
[00:29:30]  Well, if I have off, I'll be more than happy to.  Well, yeah.  I just think you better have the dumb button ready.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because, I mean, Roland just lets it fly.  So, maybe we'll do that one Saturday night during special delivery.  Just invite Roland to come up and we'll, we'll do the nine o'clock hour.  That way you'll have some time to drink ahead of time.  Yeah, it's just up by my favorite bar, The Playwrights, by Caroline's.  Yeah, it's right around here.  My buddy bartends there and I just double every drink.  And that way the audience can, uh, can get to know drunk Roland a little better. 
[00:30:00]  Because it could be exciting, don't you think?  I love that idea.  Troy, why do you think it took Ant so long to, uh, bring up stuff from the party?  Uh, but there's only two days last week.  And there was a lot going on.  Yeah.  You know?  So, I think it was just the right time to get around to it.  Yeah, and your karaoke, that's how you know you have bad timing.  Your karaoke isn't even on the video reel.  Yeah, I don't care about that.  I mean, whatever.  What did you sing?  I mean, I fucking killed it anyway, so.  What did you sing?  Wow.  He sang Elvis.  Yeah.  Burn in love.  Yeah.  You want to do it here now? 
[00:30:30]  I mean, do you want to?  Just real quick?  Yeah, Eric popped me.  Hey, you got the song, right?  I mean, Troy, you can just do it real quick.  Yeah, because we don't have the video, so maybe just real quick you can just do it.  All right, fuck it.  Let's do it.  I mean, why not?  Let's do it.  Why not, you know?  What else are we doing?  Yeah.  All right.  Ready?  It's feeling good.  It's a Monday.  Give me a little more volume.  A little more volume of that music.  Lord Almighty, feel my temperature rising.  That's good.  High and high. 
[00:31:00]  It's burning through to my soul.  Yeah.  Girl, girl, girl.  You're going to set me on fire.  Yeah.  My brain is raining.  I don't know which way to go.  With your kisses lift me high.  Like a sweet song of the choir.  And you're lighting my morning sky.  A burning love. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, baby.  Let's give it up for Troy.  Very good, Troy.  I wish we had seen the video now.  I know.  Because we were fantastic.  Next time.  Listen, we were talking to Ant today about his personal shopper and being an elitist and everything.  When he was talking about having his clothes laid out for him on the bed.  That's what Bob Kelly was talking to him about.  About how he said, Ant, when you fall off this thing, it's going to be a long fall.  Oh, oh my God.  What?  Free Slurpee Day.  Yeah, it's 7-Eleven. 
[00:32:00]  Free Slurpee Day.  You want to hit that up at around 11 o'clock?  You want to hit up 7-Eleven?  Okay.  But it's not the first time we've talked about Ant clothes shopping on the air.  He has had to go underwear shopping in the past.  For himself.  He remembers those days.  It was back in 2005 when he first talked about it.  And it's been a theme that's come up a few times.  But this is pretty much the first time we really got into it.  Ant talking about buying his own underwear right here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:32:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Have we discussed, because, of course, clothing and whatnot, another great segue.  Have we discussed buying underwear that is not just Fruit of the Loom underwear?  No.  No?  Because I don't know what is in the underwear maker's minds.  But it's embarrassing.  It's like they don't want guys to buy their product.  I've kind of gotten past the point that I want to buy Fruit of the Loom underwear. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  I kind of want to step up a little notch and maybe buy some of the Calvin Klein underwear.  What?  It's better made.  I'll tell you where I'm going.  It's made better.  It's not just like the stupid rubber bands around your legs and waistband that Fruit of the Loom has.  Wait, Boxer Beach, you want to start buying?  Well, yeah, Boxer Briefs, things like that. 
[00:33:30]  But just like name brand kind of underwear that's made of thicker material.  It's nicer.  I got to step in.  I mean, honestly, logically, that makes sense.  And to the people out there that are new to the show and they don't really know you,  they're like, yeah, this sounds very normal.  Sure.  I've known you for a long time and you're just not the same person.  What is going on in your head?  I'm just treating myself to a few of the nicer things in life. 
[00:34:00]  Do you realize this is the 38th day in a row that you haven't worn the same shirt?  I wasn't counting.  We're keeping track now.  I wasn't counting, but thank you.  So you're shopping for some silk Versace boxers and...  Well, no, not silk.  It's cotton.  But if you notice, the material's thicker.  It's more comfortable.  And they don't stretch out around the legs and stuff.  It's not the underwear you wore when you were six years old. 
[00:34:30]  You know what I mean?  You kind of move up a little bit.  Right.  But these things are almost impossible to shop for.  You go to the store.  They don't come in little, like, plastic bags.  They come in boxes.  And there's a couple or three in the box.  But have you looked at the pictures on the boxes?  Yes.  No.  You walk into the underwear section, and now I want to buy the underwear, but I don't  want to peruse through gay pornography. 
[00:35:00]  It is like you are looking at the covers of gay porn DVDs.  And you're looking at them.  You're a man standing there with your arms crossed looking at these guys in their underwear  with armadillos shoved down the front of them.  With huge hogs.  Giant hogs poking through these underwear.  And that's all they're wearing.  Poking and wanting.  Tanned washboard abs.  Straining is a word I would choose.  Ficeps. 
[00:35:30]  Smile.  They're smiling at you and kind of winking.  All they want to do is just breathe.  It is.  You don't want to look.  You don't want to shop.  So you're looking at them, and now you've got to go, maybe these.  And you're thinking, why am I going from this to this?  What makes this box better?  Is the guy cuter on the box?  Because he has that look of just wanting on his face.  It is.  It's pornography. 
[00:36:00]  It's homosexual porn.  That's really funny.  On the boxes.  And I just want to buy the goddamn underwear.  But it makes it impossible.  So now you're walking to the register holding five boxes of nude men.  And you put it on the counter, and there they are, staring back at you.  Thanks for the purchase.  I bought underpants from The Gap recently, and I took them home, and it looked okay on  the thing, like you're talking.  Then I put them on, and then proceeded to throw them away. 
[00:36:30]  Really?  Yeah, because the ones I got from The Gap make me look like I have one of those European  bathing suits on.  I don't know what that happened.  Like a Speedo?  Not a Speedo.  It's like, it kind of like, it's almost like hot pants for guys.  Yeah.  The only way I can explain it, it's like, it's like to here.  And it didn't look like that on the packaging.  Did it look like a bikini?  Not a bottom.  Bikini.  Was it cut like that?  That's like the hot pants that girls wear, but just picture it a little looser so it  would look, I guess, okay on a guy. 
[00:37:00]  I don't know.  There's real hot underwear that chicks wear.  Boy shorts?  Yeah, those short things with the frills on the bottom and around the top.  That is like the hottest fucking underwear that girls can wear.  The little short thing.  I love those boy shorts.  Isn't that great?  Oh, fantastic.  Yeah.  So when your chick is buying your underwear, that's fine.  She could go up.  There's the guy with the pecs and the abs and the muscles and the wanting look and the  perfect hair and the huge goddamn python shoved down the front of his Calvin Kleins. 
[00:37:30]  But to have to look at this, because you can't just walk up, grab it, and walk up to the  register.  You have to stand in front of this huge display of nude men and look at them.  What's the size on this one?  Hmm.  Maybe this style.  Have you gone into Abercrombie and Fitch lately?  No.  With the big blown up posters of boys topless?  God!  Why are we exposed to this? 
[00:38:00]  What is going on?  I just want a pair of jeans.  You just want some clothes.  And you gotta look at gay pornography.  You're right.  There's something going on with Abercrombie and Fitch.  Because it's mostly topless boys in the big posters on the walls.  Every once in a while.  That I care to be found.  Every once in a while they throw a girl at you.  But in general, it's these, like, I don't know.  I guess they're supposed to be 16, 17-year-old boys, topless.  What the fuck?  Oh, dear!  Oh, dear! 
[00:38:30]  What the?  Who the?  What the?  You will be molested.  Hey, Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, no, I agree with Anthony, man.  I'm a personal trainer.  I'm a big boy.  I'm, like, 6'1", 220, very athletic.  And I got to buy those Calvin Klein ones.  And it's terribly uncomfortable just going in there, staring at nude men, trying to pick up some drawers. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, it makes you yearn for the day of just grabbing that Fruit of the Loom and that plastic bag at a Dwayne Reed or something.  And just, you know, wear that.  And get out of there.  You don't want to stand in front of 100 boxes with nude men on them.  It's men in their underwear with huge hogs.  And you got to stand there.  And pick and choose.  And you feel like, you know, all right, what style should I get?  Should I get the one that's cut this way or that way?  And the only way you have to make that decision is to look at the guy. 
[00:39:30]  Well, it looks hot on him.  You know what?  You don't want to have to be put in the position where you're looking and deciding what underwear you want because it looks hot on that man.  No.  Just put a picture of the underwear on there.  You ever seen The Invisible Man?  You ever seen an Invisible Man movie?  Yes.  Oh, a movie.  I'm like, how can you see The Invisible Man?  Of course not.  I saw a hat once.  He's a silly.  Yeah, I saw a hat just floating by. 
[00:40:00]  Glasses and gauze.  But, you know, he can walk around in his underwear, but all you see is the underwear.  He saw footsteps in the snow once.  Jesus.  That's it?  I've seen him.  He produces this radio show.  That's what I want to see on the box.  Just the underwear.  Hold on, bro.  Just the underwear as if The Invisible Man was wearing it.  All right.  Put it on there and just have it take out the person.  So now you're looking at the underwear itself.  Not on a guy. 
[00:40:30]  No guy is going in and buying it because the guy looked good on the package.  Have women wearing the goddamn men's underwear.  How about that?  Then I'd look and go, ooh.  You'd feel gay then.  Then you'd feel like a fag buying these because they're on chicks.  No, but it's the chick wearing men's underwear.  You know?  So it's like, all right, I see what style it is, how it's cut, how far down the leg it  comes, things like that.  But it also is a pleasure to look at.  Sure is.  And you can take it home and save the box to Jack, too.  There you go.  After ONA Live. 
[00:41:00]  You bet it is.  Proof right there.  Evidence that at one point Anthony did buy his own underwear.  On today's show, he was saying that, you know, he's wearing a shirt that he was getting  made fun of, which I don't like personally.  I don't like when people get made fun of.  But he was wearing a shirt that Bobby Kelly and Jim were making fun of, and he said that  the way he gets clothes now is that they're laid out on the bed for him, and he picks what  he likes and he doesn't like, and what he doesn't like just disappears.  And what he doesn't like gets to stay in his closet. 
[00:41:30]  It's an amazing way to live.  But that was only in 2005 when he was talking about buying his own underwear.  It's crazy to me.  Somebody, I was reading my tweets while I was playing, and somebody said, how long  ago was this?  2005 was already six years ago.  Eric, can you believe that clip is six years old?  We've been around a long time.  Too long, Eric.  Both of us, you and I.  It seems that way.  Have been here way too long.  This is like maybe something that the peak of its productivity hit probably three years 
[00:42:00]  in.  This was around May?  Beginning of May 2005.  It's over six years old.  This was over six years ago.  And you and I were both around for it.  Yeah.  It's a shame, Eric.  This, in this day and age, shouldn't be happening.  Another, and I mean, I should clear up a controversy.  Another tweet that I was getting while this was playing.  I mean, I sometimes check my Twitter at NotSam while bits are playing. 
[00:42:30]  But that was where the controversy lied.  Somebody tweeted saying, what the hell is this?  A bit playing during, after Opie and Anthony live, this is not what I pay for.  No, that's what I said to you.  That was your, okay.  That was me.  I guess I didn't realize that.  I'm going to say that to your face.  Yeah.  I mean, somebody also tweeted it in, though.  Oh.  So maybe we should.  I mean, I guess I have felt like we've been playing a few too many bits lately.  So maybe we'll try to, you know, squash that a little bit.  The Ron and Fez interns are putting the finishing touches on the studio. 
[00:43:00]  While the mics are live.  Is it a big Ron and Fez show today?  Big Ron and Fez show today.  What's going on?  Lots of stuff.  Okay, you don't know what's going on, do you?  I have no idea.  You don't know.  No idea.  They kind of keep you in the dark a little bit.  Yes.  Are you going to be, what, screening calls?  Or what are you going to be doing?  Yeah, screening calls and other good stuff.  So Ron and Fez call screener is a stressful job.  They do a lot of calls.  Very stressful.  Extremely stressful.  But you get her done?  Get her done.  I mean, sometimes when they do, like, music bits, it's impossible to keep up.  Yeah.  And Zito's a lot better.  Like, he's a pro.  Well, he's, yeah, I mean, he's paid to do it. 
[00:43:30]  So I would hope that he's better than you.  Yeah.  He is literally professional.  They pay him to, you know, screen calls and do other tasks.  Yes.  So, yeah, you're right about that.  But who's better?  Who's, are you the best intern as far as phone screening goes?  Phone screening?  Yeah, I think I am.  Ouch.  That guy out there is like, what the fuck?  No, no.  But he's got talent.  He's a great singer-songwriter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not a good phone screener.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying.  But not as good as you.  Yeah, but I'm like a smidge above.  But he's better at singer-songwriting than you. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, he's really good.  All right.  I'm not a good call screener.  You're not a good call screener.  No, no.  Actually, no, I would say I'm pretty good.  I would say I'm pretty good.  All right.  Well, I guess the only way to find out is to listen to Ron and Fez today and hear the  quality of the calls that get through on the air.  You can call them up at, you tell the phone number.  It's your show.  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ.  Way to plug the show, guys.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  And as always, Opie and Anthony, and After Opie and Anthony Live, continue tomorrow. 
[00:44:30]  Good day, everybody. </pre>
