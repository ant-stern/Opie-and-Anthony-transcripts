<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King's intro, immediately followed by a discussion of a morning altercation involving their security guard and Travis, who had called the guard a "fucking idiot" after his ID was deactivated for being lost.  The hosts then launched into a scathing, vulgar critique of Rick Santorum, fueled by intense dislike and speculation about his personal life and political future.  This transitioned into a debate on global warming, with Opie expressing skepticism and Anthony countering, punctuated by show employee Sam repeatedly showing them pictures of gay pornography, prompting further graphic discussion.  A lengthy segment followed, focusing on a women's college basketball player who had dunked, with the hosts commenting on her appearance and athleticism using terms like "monster" and "beast," and segueing into critiques of women's sports attire, particularly field hockey uniforms, accompanied by numerous sexually suggestive comments. The Denver Broncos' acquisition of Peyton Manning and the controversy surrounding his jersey number became another focal point, with the hosts speculating—using offensive language and jokes—about a potential financial agreement regarding the previously retired jersey number 18 worn by Frank Tripuka.  The segment concluded with preparations for Jimmy Norton's upcoming appearance on Fox & Friends.

The show continued with a chaotic mix of segments.  Discussions of a Jimmy Fallon song, their simulcast with Jim Norton on Fox & Friends, and a nonsensical impromptu song preceded a pre-recorded segment of Primetime Sam Roberts interviewing Jason Priestley with only one question regarding his car's fuel type. A significant portion focused on "Busy Buddies," particularly "Whore Talk with Nicole Biggums," analyzing Biggums' explicit confessions and predicting her impending marriage's failure.  The hosts then dissected Jimmy Norton's appearance on Fox & Friends, critiquing the panelists' appearances and personalities with crude sexual jokes, expressing dissatisfaction with how it unfolded.  This was followed by a remixed Mitt Romney audio clip, discussions of Kirk Cameron's comments on gay marriage and his Fox News appearance, and commentary on a 43-year-old Bengals cheerleader deemed too old for the role.  The show then touched upon the firing of a radio host for using a racial slur ("three monkeys"), leading into a preview of an upcoming Chris Jericho interview, all while punctuated by interruptions, arguments between the hosts about scheduling and Kenny's role, and crude humor.

The next segment began with the hosts expressing extreme disdain for a show opening featuring Audra Lindley and Norman Fell, calling it the "worst show opening ever" and a "fucking bat to the stomach."  This led to a conversation about Heinz Ward's retirement and player loyalty.  Studio guest Chris Jericho then joined, discussing his experience on *Dancing with the Stars*, his rivalry with CM Punk (including controversial promos utilizing Punk's family's personal struggles), his band Fozzy, their upcoming Download Festival performance, and the challenges of professional wrestling, including anecdotes about Mick Foley and Jericho's own frugal lifestyle.  Past show appearances with Frantic Fran and Dice Clay were also mentioned.  The segment ended with discussion of Jericho's WrestleMania match against CM Punk and his disdain for fans outside of conventions.

Anthony Cumia recounted a chaotic incident in Victoria, BC, where he was attacked by a crowd after a show, contrasting his experience with Nancy Grace's reporting.  The Jersey Shore cast, specifically The Situation's potential rehab and Snooki's pregnancy, and the show's future and declining ratings were discussed, along with "The Unit."  A comparison of physiques, notably Ryan Bader's abs, and humorous insinuations about sexuality followed.  A "Jimspirations" segment featuring bizarre inspirational quotes, a sexually explicit phone call between Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia from early 2010, and commentary on vintage commercials (Charmin, Creepy Crawlers, a Plymouth Duster, and a Charles Nelson Reilly commercial) with sexually suggestive and crude jokes concluded this segment.  A discussion of a Paul Lynde show intro comparing its canned laughter to contemporary television ended the section.

A comedic bit involving a fictional story about Paul Lynn, his golfing skills, stock market success, and his daughter's marriage to Howie, filled with sexually suggestive humor and celebrity comparisons, was read.  This transitioned into a discussion of the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment, introducing "Chippy Lynn" (a Paul Lynde impression), interactions with Club Soda Kenny, and a heated on-air disagreement between Jimmy and another host regarding a Christopher Reeve joke, further exploring the show's history and host-staff dynamics.  Several recurring characters and jokes were also mentioned.

Finally, the show opened with a discussion about Chris Jericho's radio show (initially misidentified), followed by a conversation about whether professional wrestlers are genuinely tough, spurred by a false claim of a conflict with Jon Jones.  Steroid use in wrestling and the Chris Benoit tragedy were discussed.  Anecdotes about interactions with The Rock (described as docile), Ice Cube (and his transition to family films), and a detailed Vin Diesel birthday party followed.  A significant discussion regarding the "Dougie" dance craze and its popularity among white people, leading to reflections on "gangster" culture, references to NWA and Ice Cube's "Fuck the Police," concluded with future appearances and guest mentions (The Muppets and Mick Jagger), and a brief appearance by DJ Hook in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  You should get it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's my nipples hogging. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Enough palaver.  Was there a palaver? Was there a lot of palaver there?  I don't think there was any palaver for him to be enough palaver. I don't know.  We did a fine 10-minute podcast for everybody.  Oh, no, that's right. We weren't recording. 
[00:01:00]  We went through the headlines already.  Yeah, we already fucking hashed it out.  We did our two cents on the headlines, Sam, so we're good with that. We don't need to do news now.  I mean, you're not considering the audience.  We hashed it all out amongst ourselves.  It's not our problem you guys weren't recording.  People were left out.  Yeah, you've got to catch this shit when it's happening.  Don't wait for us to turn the mics on when the fucking radio cold is happening.  Come on. Come on.  Come on.  He didn't give me one this morning.  Why? What's wrong with him?  I don't know. I walk out of the elevator. He's just sitting there.  He wasn't going to say anything, so I turn around to him. 
[00:01:30]  I went, good morning.  And then he just went, good morning.  Probably because Travis called him a fucking idiot while he was in earshot.  Oh, shit.  Why did he do that?  Oh, no.  Oh, why did he do that?  Travis was frustrated with his ID card this morning.  What did he call him?  The security guard.  He didn't call these.  Not to his face, but before the door shut, he said, I mean, I could have still heard him if I was sitting where he was.  But was he calling that guy a fucking idiot? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Why him if, wow.  So now we all have to suffer.  We don't get our good morning.  Because Travis's ID card was deactivated.  Yeah.  Well, it should be.  No kidding.  Because he lost it, but the guy told him to rub it.  Why don't you rub it?  Just rub it.  Like it's a hotel key.  Just rub it, morning.  Rub it on your leg.  Rub it, rub it.  Welcome aboard with the rub the key.  Rub it.  Does that work?  No, of course not.  Never. 
[00:02:30]  Never.  Does that work?  It works with your hotel key.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  But maybe not with the ID around here.  He might not have actually heard.  Maybe Travis was fired.  He might not have actually heard Travis say that.  You never know when people get fired.  Maybe he was fired.  Well, Travis lost his card, and so they specifically deactivated it.  Oh, really?  So rubbing it would have done.  Good morning.  Rub the card morning.  Morning.  Rub the aboard.  Welcome morning.  Cod rub.  Well, I'm happy to say that Rick Santorum certainly will not be our next president. 
[00:03:00]  No, no.  He's not getting the nomination.  And I am very happy to say that today.  This psychopath.  Yeah.  Look, man, I don't like any of them, but I will absolutely accept a Romney if I have to.  But not this Santorum fucking cat.  Santorum's an idiot.  And he lost again, so he's going to have to fade out now too, right?  Gingrich hasn't, and he's been getting killed.  No, Gingrich loves the spotlight, though. 
[00:03:30]  I know.  And we love watching him.  Let's all be honest.  Yeah.  I don't know about his politics.  I don't agree with his politics, but I love watching that fucking Duke Gingrich.  Was it Jimmy Kimmel last night that said that?  He goes, Gingrich should marry the primaries.  So that way he'll leave it eventually.  It was a really good line.  I'm sure I'm trouncing upon it.  I love Newt Gingrich because he's just being a dick now. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't even have a chance.  Not a chance in hell.  But he's not leaving.  I guess Santorum has an outside chance, right?  No.  No.  They said he doesn't really have, he doesn't have the delegates.  At this point, neither guy has a chance.  Yeah.  And if he was getting any delegates because he was winning decisively in certain states,  that would be one thing.  But he's just barely squeaking by when he does win.  Yeah.  So it's over for him. 
[00:04:30]  So Newt Gingrich is just being a dick there.  137 delegates Newt has.  And, you know, Romney's got 400 in shape.  I know.  I keep saying I'm not leaving anytime soon.  Ron Paul, you understand, because he has a whole, you know, he has a whole movement  and a whole agenda.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  He doesn't care.  In the end, it's going to be good for him and his people that he stays in there a long  time.  But what does Newt gain?  More weight.  See, because he's chubby.  More face time for Newt. 
[00:05:00]  What does Santorum do after he, you know, drops out of this thing eventually?  Goes back into his lower level politics.  Oh, good.  He's just fucking hot.  Fool around with your stupid thoughts down there.  Yeah, go back to wherever you fucking came from.  He's hateable.  He's hateable, right?  He's really hateable.  And I don't hate politicians that often, like, specifically as much as I hate his guts.  Yeah.  Really hate him.  Why do you hate his guts?  Because he's, uh, he's...  More than just the porn thing, right? 
[00:05:30]  Even the conservatives bug me because there's so much for less government until it comes  time to your personal life.  Right.  And they can't get enough big government in your personal life.  And he wants to fucking legislate about gay marriage and he's worried about pornography.  And so he's like, just go fuck yourself.  Right.  There's bigger problems in this country.  He's obsessed with the gays.  Yeah.  Douchebag he is.  Who gives a fuck what the gays do?  Oh, does he hate the gay?  Who gives a fuck?  I care about gas prices and jobs and all...  Yeah.  Other things, way before any of that crap, I've never wanted anybody to be arrested for 
[00:06:00]  fucking blowing someone so badly.  And I've never wanted someone to get busted so badly.  When you're that obsessed, there's something going on.  Maybe officially he hasn't done anything, but there's some kind of feeling in that guy's  head that he can't handle at night when he's by himself and his voice.  It just always happens that way.  The people that are so against something have a problem with it.  Right.  There's something going on.  There has to be.  Whether at night he's just dreaming about guys or something, you know. 
[00:06:30]  Whatever it is.  I don't know.  Maybe it's not even guys.  Who knows?  Oh, it's probably guys.  You think it's guys?  Yeah.  Oh, it's probably guys.  Maybe not of age.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  I'll be discussing this on Fox and Friends shortly.  Yes.  Jimmy's going to be on Fox and Friends.  They had me earlier before the show.  They put me on a panel at 7.15.  I'm surprised you're here right now.  No, I don't have to go.  You're crazy.  It's right across the street.  If I was doing Fox and Friends, you wouldn't see my ass right now.  Oh, really?  Any excuse.  No, I'd be fucking getting ready for my Fox and Friends appearance. 
[00:07:00]  Any excuse.  Right.  Exactly.  Any excuse, I'll fucking grab for that shit.  So recto mundo.  I'm really going to bitch to you because you did TV?  Hell no.  Why are you here?  Jimmy's very motivated.  Jimmy just loves being here.  Yeah.  And we like that.  Yeah.  So Santorum is certainly not going to be the president.  No.  Good thing to have had it with him.  Fucking...  I just...  I can't wait until he just goes away.  He's a prick.  Just go away.  Every time I see him on the news, it's just so fucking, like, frustrating that there's people 
[00:07:30]  that have power in this country that are like that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, just fanatic.  Mm-hmm.  Having his fucking religion get involved in everything.  It's just as bad.  Not...  It's not just as bad because of what's gone on in the world as crazy fucking Islamics.  But it's like...  It's the same thing, you know?  When you have that much religion influencing your political aspirations... 
[00:08:00]  Right.  It's the same fucking thing.  Well, what's scarier is that a guy like this came so close.  He got pretty close.  Yeah, yeah.  He was in the lead at one point.  And he's down to, like, the second guy, basically.  We don't like religious fanaticism when other countries have their leaders using it all the time.  Of course.  Why the fuck do we want it here?  Well, he got pretty close with his crazy thoughts, and that's kind of scary, I think.  Yeah.  I mean, Romney would never pick him as a VP, right? 
[00:08:30]  No.  You know more about that than myself.  No, no, no.  I can't see that happening.  What it is, though, is I think, and I hope, anyway, that his religious ramblings have been  what kind of shut him down and what made people kind of back off and go, eh, eh.  Okay.  Because it just, you know, I can't...  I hope the majority of this country isn't that crazy.  I know we have our fucking Bible belt and...  Well, we don't know the middle of this country.  No, no.  We broadcast everyone now, and it's awesome.  I love it. 
[00:09:00]  But we don't know.  Thank you.  There's a whole world out there we don't know anything about because there's plenty of those  people that think like Santorum.  That are just fucking, you know, who cares?  Like I said, I'm not sitting here on my soapbox defending the gay, but I sure as shit don't care  what they do with their own fucking dumbass lives.  Of course.  I could give a shit what the gays do.  Of course.  It's not a fucking issue.  Of course.  It's not anybody's business.  No, it's no one's business.  Let them fucking take their big, fat, turgid, veiny cocks, right? 
[00:09:30]  And let them just slam them into each other's ass off.  Nice.  Oh, just pounding until their balls explode, come way in the guy's sphincter.  Don't forget sucking at first.  Oh, and then taking that cock and just...  Like that.  Oh, just like that.  Yeah.  A big, veiny, fat, throbbing cock.  Let's do this.  And the guy is sucking it.  Wah, wah, just down his throat till he...  Wah!  Yeah.  Slow down a little bit, please. 
[00:10:00]  I don't care.  Like that, right?  Why would I care?  Right there.  Thank you, Sam.  Thanks, Sam, for that picture.  Like that, right?  Oh, the guy's looking down at a dick in his asshole from between his legs.  That just looks like fun.  Ah, doesn't it look like they're having a pisser?  They just look like they're having a ball.  Ah, they're having so much fun.  Because the guy on the bottom used to kick his legs like a baby and go, yay, yay.  Yeah, that weird legs akimbo straight up while the guy's plowing his ass and his feet  are in the other guy's face. 
[00:10:30]  I wouldn't get fucked in the ass just because my abs couldn't take half of my legs up that  hard.  You'd have to rest your legs, right?  Oh, they would just be all...  I'd be a terrible bottom.  That's classic.  In other news...  Well, it's being said here that Sam is showing me pictures from his private collection.  Well, I would assume so.  We all just assumed that.  Where are you at with global warming, man?  Come on.  You've got to start thinking some shit.  No.  They're starting to say they've never seen weather like we're seeing the last couple  days.  That's horse shit. 
[00:11:00]  It was 85 in Chicago yesterday.  It's horse shit, though.  And I think we were in, what, mid-70s easy here?  There's no...  They always say, like, it's the hottest since.  They don't say ever.  When they say ever, then I'll be like, oh, okay, maybe...  I think they're starting to say ever.  Nah.  For this, yeah, for this warm front that came through.  Maybe this one that comes through.  It's like...  But you also got to remember we're about three years into this, too, so we're starting to  get used to summer starting in March.  Last winter was freezing fucking cold. 
[00:11:30]  We got a shitload of snow.  And this winter, so what?  So what?  We got a nice, mellow winter.  It's happened before.  We've had winters where we've had no snow, and it hasn't been that cold.  But we've had the complete opposite in one year.  That's creepy, too.  Yeah.  So?  I don't think there's...  I don't see a problem with...  I absolutely believe we're affecting the weather.  Yeah.  I think humans on this planet, over the years, especially since the Industrial Revolution,  have affected weather patterns based on the shit we pump in the air, population, deforestation. 
[00:12:00]  I absolutely think we've had some effect.  But like any other animal on this planet, there is a cause and effect.  I just don't think it's that big a deal or that bad of something.  Whatever changes are made, it's an occurrence because of what we've done, and it's a natural thing,  and we'll adapt to it.  You have blinders on.  No, I don't. 
[00:12:30]  You do.  I'm just not a panicky Pete when it comes to this global warming thing.  The earth is fine.  Don't worry.  I was going for a bit.  You got blinders on because you just want your pool open.  Well, that's true.  So to you, you're just ignoring this shit.  April 2nd.  You're just focused on that pool.  You're looking out your window every day going, damn, that's happening April 2nd.  April 2nd, motherfuckers.  Fuck this global warming.  If you notice, I probably have a little color today.  I was yesterday.  What the fuck?  You know how much I spent for this color that I got?  And you got it yesterday in your backyard?  Right out in the yard. 
[00:13:00]  You mother of her.  Pulled out the Chase lounges for the first time of the year, laid down, and it's fucking March.  Laid down.  The sun was nice and hot.  You shouldn't be getting sunburns in early to mid-March in New York.  Fabulous.  Do you understand that?  Fabulous.  You should understand that.  What about that one?  Sam just keeps popping up.  Sam, do you understand we're way past that fucking discussion?  Sam just keeps getting new kicks.  I search gay tanning.  I thought that's what it was.  Oh.  But we're way past the gay thing, and you're still showing us gay pictures, so that means 
[00:13:30]  something's going on with you, sir.  What is that one, Sam?  Let me just see that one.  Gay tanning.  I thought this would bring the two topics together.  The guy literally has a thong tan line on his ample bubble ass.  Why would you do that?  Because you're gay.  If I was built like that, I would absolutely thong tan.  You would have a thong tan?  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  I would always show it off.  You'd show people the tan line?  Yeah.  Look at my bubble butt. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Give me a second.  A bubble butt.  Give me a second.  A bubble butt.  Well.  All right.  No global warming.  Fair enough.  No.  Setting records, all-time records all over the place.  I think, like I said, I think we affect it, but I don't think it's that big a deal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mexico dodged a bullet.  Mexico.  What was the earthquake?  Yeah.  It was like a 7.6, I think.  7.6 is pretty impressive.  Cost millions in improvements. 
[00:14:30]  I know.  Gay.  I know.  Did anyone tweet that?  Probably.  But the earthquake was deep in the earth, and that's why there wasn't  major damage down there.  It is deep in the earth.  It was like 12 miles down.  12 miles?  I think.  I think that's what they said.  Closer to the surface, more damage, obviously.  So that's why you're not hearing much about the Mexico earthquake.  Yeah.  Plus, it was in an area, I think, that wasn't heavily populated.  Mexico's great.  They got these areas that it's just like, eh, who gives a shit? 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Fuck it.  But at first, they said it was Mexico City itself, but then it turns out it was not  so close to Mexico City.  Within range of Mexico City, obviously, but.  Yeah.  Well, good for the Mexicans.  I'm glad.  Good for the Mexicans.  I'm glad for the Mexicans.  Good for the Mexicans.  A little shake, rattle, and roll for those guys.  Yeah, yeah.  That's okay.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Why good for the Mexicans?  Well, good.  No, good that they didn't get any damage.  I'm saying it's good they didn't get any damage. 
[00:15:30]  Good for those Mexicans.  I like the Mexicans.  I don't want to ever feel a 7.8 earthquake.  Like, no.  I felt that shakedown in the Outer Banks last summer.  The one that hit up here, too.  Where was it?  In Virginia or something?  Oh, yeah.  That's some weird shit.  We're not used to that.  You really get this feeling like, wow, there's really nothing I can do about this.  No.  It's like, the Earth is moving.  Ah.  Really strange, though, to feel, yeah, to feel the actual Earth moving.  Yeah, you're like, ooh, there's nowhere to really go to get out of the moving. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, people in California laugh at that shit.  They're just used to it now?  Yeah.  I don't think you ever get used to that.  Whenever there's something, an earthquake out here, you know, they always say, oh, well,  we got an earthquake last night.  Did you feel it?  Oh, they go to the weatherman.  Yeah, I feel it.  It was like 2 in the morning and I feel it.  But California sees that shit and goes, shut up.  Yeah.  Please.  They get rocked with things like that all the time.  But then, you know, they wait for the big one, as they call it. 
[00:16:30]  We've always heard about the big one.  When's that coming?  Sam, show us the big one.  Yeah.  Sam heard the big one and there he goes.  Another fucking.  Sam, you're so gee.  Jesus.  Sam's gee.  Oh, Sam.  All right.  Oh, Sam.  Wow.  Big one.  Sam probably just looks at these pictures and they confuse him as to what they're giving  him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What they're making is you-know-what bump.  Big one.  You like the big one. 
[00:17:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You guys, you watched the Knicks last night when Saturday's back.  Lin Sanity.  I don't think you could add Sanity at the end when it's a hit or miss thing where occasionally  he's doing good and then he's just, he's a regular player now.  Nah, he's a little better than a regular player.  He's Lin perfectly sane.  The Knicks got this new coach, Mike Woodson, and I think this guy knows how to fucking coach  this team.  Yeah?  So far, so good.  Yeah, they got a little winning streak. 
[00:17:30]  And Lin Sanity's back again.  So you could wear the jersey without looking silly?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  But what about like next week?  I don't know.  We'll have to wait and see.  You ever wear the jersey?  We'll have to wait and see.  You had a good game last night.  Real good.  But you don't care, so.  Why am I bringing it?  Nah, I'm not really a basketball guy.  I just know about the, uh, uh, what?  The Lady Redman, Lady Red Storm.  Holy shit.  Is in the Sweet 16.  Oh, no.  Gives a shit about fucking women's basketball. 
[00:18:00]  No one does.  No, I thought you were going to go with the fucking, the, the animal.  What?  Well, maybe I shouldn't say it because I don't know what color she is.  Shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Imus.  Oh, boy.  Here comes Sharpie.  Hey, Imus.  Oh, boy.  Holy shit, I'm doing a show with Don Imus over here.  I should have said, I should have said, I should have said monster.  Yeah.  What'd you say?  Basically, what I'm trying to say is there was a female basketball player yesterday who  fucking dunked.  And I think that's the, only the second time that has happened in, uh, in women's basketball, 
[00:18:30]  women's NCAA basketball.  I believe.  I believe.  Monster's good.  Yeah, yeah, because that's like big.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  And, uh, she's 6'8", and just fucking, I don't know, it was like an animal move, I  think.  6'8"?  Yeah.  You got the video clip?  Everyone else is showing it, Sam.  She's a tall chick.  Why don't we have it?  Sam's too busy looking up, uh, gay porno.  Yeah, the only thing you find immediately is when we ask for fucking larger, specific,  and get Cox's hook to the left.  But here, isn't that fucked up?  Like, he sucks on the computer. 
[00:19:00]  We're not complaining about the gay images, but you gotta get this other stuff up too fast.  Exactly.  And we can all get hard eyes, but let's get to the basketball, too.  You didn't see this dunk?  No.  It's a big story today in sports.  Huh.  Not as big as the Tebow thing, but it's big.  Tebow, Tebow, uh, to gangrene, huh?  Uh...  Oh, boy.  Well, isn't Sanchez gonna be annoyed at that?  Well, he should be.  They had to give him an extension on his contract, two years.  They didn't want to do that.  They didn't want to do that. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, man.  He's a fucking asshole.  How great is Florentine?  Florentine's the best.  He fired everyone up yesterday.  Yeah, he's Florentine.  I got a lot of tweets about Florentine yesterday.  He's great.  He's so fucking good.  People love him.  People hating him, and that's perfect.  Why do they hate him, though?  He's so funny.  But that's perfect.  You want that.  Because people have a passion for their team.  Yeah.  He's a fun guy.  All right, this...  Wow.  This monster.  Sorry.  Wow.  Sorry.  Watch this.  Tall woman.  Jesus.  She got it in there.  Yeah, she did.  That's a tall woman.  I think someone who knows more about sports than us can maybe back us up. 
[00:20:00]  I like how it barely gets in, though.  It's like, ah.  But the...  I mean...  None of that Jordan airtime pedaling in the air and slamming it down.  I think the only other dunk in women's basketball in the NCAA was like a breakaway.  Yeah.  So she had a nice running start.  This was just in the paint, as they like to say.  Turned around and fucking slammed it home.  Yeah, where people are like, whoa!  Can you say she's a beast? 
[00:20:30]  Whoa.  Because she did that?  What's proper, right?  I wouldn't even gamble these days.  I'm not gambling.  I don't know.  Oh, I would call her a wonderful woman.  Really?  Just this wonderful woman.  Would you date a 6'8 monster?  Eesh.  Would you walk around with a 6'8 girl, Jim?  If I was 7'2", if I was Kareem, I would.  But even then, it might be a little embarrassing.  But you don't mind your girls being taller than you?  No, I prefer it.  But a 6'8", a little too much?  I'd like to have sex with a giant.  You would?  Oh, fine. 
[00:21:00]  I wouldn't mind a giantess.  She'd have to have a big, juicy ass, but not fat.  I would fucking hang with a chick that tall, eat her big pussy.  Eat her big pussy.  I'd be out of my mind for that.  Well, we'd all have sex with a giant.  But I mean, would you date a giant?  That's the difference.  If she looked like Brigitte Nielsen, she's a tall...  Oh, my God.  Really?  You're into her?  That body is fucking great.  But that's a big girl, like a tall body, who I think is really nice.  You've got to think old school Brigitte.  Yeah.  Not new Brigitte.  She's a monster, too, man. 
[00:21:30]  She's huge.  But in the day, she was hot.  Ah.  Now she's a fucking disaster.  Is that her now?  Oh, I thought Sam was pulling up more gay porno.  Yeah.  That's Brigitte now.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  She's not that bad for all those...  Oh, stop.  Go to Brigitte, like, 1990s.  She looks horrid.  She would rip your dick off.  Her tits look awful.  Yeah, but look at her back then.  She was fucking sexy, man.  Yeah.  That's even...  That isn't even it.  I always felt like she...  Yeah, she was even on Vago's one.  Hold on.  I always felt like she had a slight man face.  Even in her hot days, man. 
[00:22:00]  Well, no, punch up...  Dude.  Because her hair is short.  Punch up, like, a picture of her from the 80s.  How long was she with Stallone?  She sent him nude pictures.  I think that's how they met.  Really?  That's from the rumor, yeah.  That would hurt with Mark Gastineau.  Remember, he punched her for...  But...  He knocked her around for a few years.  All right.  But this proves my point.  What a dopey-looking fuck he was.  This proves my point, though.  Mark Gastineau is huge.  Yeah, yeah.  And she looks like she's just as tall and just as big.  They look like two cardboard cutouts that have been put together the way their hands... 
[00:22:30]  Right.  It doesn't really look like they're touching each other.  Do you realize how big that bitch is?  And that's her in her prime, man.  She's as big as Mark Gastineau.  Come on.  Red Sonja.  Pull up the Red Sonja picture.  Yeah.  All the way to the right.  Give her a little smooch.  Oh, there you are.  Come on.  You wouldn't fucking...  Look at that body.  That's ridiculous.  She was slamming back then.  That fucking...  Oh, she's a lovely...  Big, long thighs to wrap around your head and make you smell her butt.  But she looks a lot...  She looks a lot thinner there than when she was with Mark Gastineau, though. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  She was juicy, man.  How tall...  She's probably 5'10".  I mean, I'm looking at her like she's a fucking...  No, she's got to be over six foot.  Biggest lady in the world ever.  You think?  Over six?  Oh, I think...  Look at her neck.  I think Gastineau is pretty tall.  That's got to be photoshopped.  Come on.  Is that real?  I don't know.  She...  Why are we talking about her again?  She was hot back in the...  Tall ladies.  Tall, tall, tall bitches.  And Joan Rivers called her a cunt years ago.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A hundred web show or something.  Good for her.  Good for her.  Her name is Brittany, and she plays center for Baylor. 
[00:23:30]  That monster's name is Brittany?  Brittany.  That's a...  Wow, that's not...  That's not understanding...  Parents were trying.  Your newborn.  We're trying back then.  Yeah, but you...  She probably has tall parents, so the tall parents should figure...  Well, maybe we shouldn't call her our kid Brittany.  Brittany.  She doesn't look like a Brittany.  No, she doesn't.  No, we're going to get in trouble.  No, you can say she doesn't look like Brittany.  This college basketball shit gets people in trouble.  Oh, it gets people so mad.  Because we're supposed to look at them like dainty fucking females. 
[00:24:00]  Get out of here.  You can't just be honest and say, wow, that's a brute.  I just don't find this...  She looks like a brute.  I just don't like ladies' sports.  I mean, I guess there's a place for it, but it just doesn't...  I don't care about it.  I can barely enjoy men's, plus a bunch of chicks running around.  All I'm thinking of is all the things that could be getting cooked right now.  All the dinners being missed.  If it's the same sport men play, it's tough to not watch the male version.  Why would you watch NCAA women's basketball when you can watch NCAA men's basketball? 
[00:24:30]  Is that bad, too?  I think...  I like watching women's sports, but it has to be one of those sports that just women do for the most part.  Women and men should compete and start...  Like, there's a woman and men's chess champion, which I don't get.  I think that's just because guys don't want to lose to a woman.  Right.  But there's no reason to split that by gender.  I'll be fair. 
[00:25:00]  I liked women's Olympic hockey.  It wasn't bad.  I didn't mind that as much.  Yeah, I didn't mind that as much when the Olympics were around a couple years ago.  I don't want to watch them bitches.  You don't like watching them bitches?  And I don't mind the lingerie football league.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, of course.  There you go.  I'll occasionally pull my car next to a high school and watch some of that fucking field hockey.  Oh, who wouldn't?  Some pervert invented that sport.  You know.  We've done this break, right?  With their little skirts.  With their skirts and they have to bend over the whole time.  That's...  A pervert fucking came up with that. 
[00:25:30]  Those uniforms that they wear are just archaic, though.  Right.  Why wouldn't it be...  There's really no need for that.  I don't want to fuck up the sport for everyone that jerks off to it, but why wouldn't they...  Why wouldn't they put them in shorts?  Put them in shorts.  Regular shorts.  Not skirts as they're bending over the entire game because they...  The inventor of the sport also made their dumb field hockey sticks too short.  They're very short.  So they have to bend all the way over.  Those dumb curly sticks.  And they're bent over hitting...  Oh, they're all wearing shorts.  Wait.  What the fuck?  Wait a minute.  A what?  What?  Did they change the whole thing around? 
[00:26:00]  Are you sure those are shorts?  Are those...  Is that a skort?  That's not...  That's not traditional field hockey.  I only watch traditional.  Is that a skirt or...  I don't know.  It's probably a skirt short.  There's no way they're playing in skirts, dude.  Waitress is going to wear skirts anymore.  They used to.  They used to play in these big, heavy, like...  They absolutely used to wear plaid skirts.  Wear just skirts when I was growing up.  And then the stick itself is shaped so they can, you know, touch the G-spot.  Oh, yeah.  It's curved for her pleasure.  For her pleasure.  Her pleasure.  Is it supposed to be some kind of a Scottish thing with the skirt and the... 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but...  Like, is it...  Is that where...  No.  Are they still wearing skirts?  Is that skirts?  Yeah, that's a skirt.  And those are tight skirts.  I think...  Those are real tight skirts.  Wow.  Where's that school?  Let's go watch field hockey.  Let's pull up with a cooler and a beach chair.  That would be hilarious.  Why not?  How quick would the cops show up?  Would they be called if you just got out of your car, you break out a cooler, and you  just start fucking drinking beers and watching the young girls play field hockey? 
[00:27:00]  What a weird fucking sport, man.  It's a dumb fucking...  A dumb game.  Is that the number one pervert sport, you think, for the pervs?  Let me think.  Schoolyard sports.  Gymnastics gets a little crazy.  Gymnastics, but you got to get inside the school for that one.  That's a tough nut.  Oh, you're talking about outdoor sports?  Yeah, yeah, you know.  Might be able to look over the fence?  Right.  Shit like that.  Exactly.  Well, you don't want to watch softball.  Because those...  No, they're all bruisers. 
[00:27:30]  They're usually some beasts.  Yeah, yeah.  Usually.  I don't know.  I, uh...  Field hockey, uh...  Field hockey.  I guess she's spreading her legs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With a dumb stick.  Dumb little wooden curvy stick.  Tiny, tiny, short stick.  Tiny little...  Short and stick.  Bending over for the entire game as you're wearing a skirt.  Does anyone care about field hockey?  I don't know.  They don't...  Like, I never see it...  I never see amateur field hockey on television. 
[00:28:00]  They never have field hockey.  What was that?  Hmm?  What's that?  What was that noise?  Is my phone vibrating?  Oh, it's yours.  Oh!  Something's going on in my brain.  Boyfriend?  Yes.  So, so Linsanity...  Linsanity is back, Ant.  Oh, Linsanity.  It absolutely is back.  I don't know about that.  It's back.  Trust me on this one.  And Jets have reportedly discussed trading for Tim Debo.  Yes.  So that means the Jets will have two average quarterbacks. 
[00:28:30]  That's great.  Yeah.  But maybe they could, like, split the game and confuse everybody.  But I just think...  There it is.  They're showing it.  They're going to show us all day.  What can we officially call her?  A monster or a beast?  I'd say monster.  Monster.  She's a big girl.  She's not that bad looking, though.  Like, she's not fat.  What?  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Fuck it.  I'm telling you, she's not.  When you see her hair down and she's running, she's not that bad.  Can we give you an eye test?  Let me see her again.  How can you say she's not bad looking? 
[00:29:00]  She's not fat.  Like, she's...  Her body, she's an athlete.  She looks like a man.  That's a man.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's a man.  Holy shit.  That face is not good.  She looks like the fucking guy from Q&A.  You remember that guy?  Oh, he calls us both a Nancy.  I could vomit.  Wow.  That is a fucking dude.  That's a boy, man.  That's a dude face.  Absolutely.  Yeah, that's...  With the hair back, it's not good.  With the hair down in the video, she was just running. 
[00:29:30]  I'm backpedaling.  Got a Sam Roberts hairdo.  See, but right...  Like, not there.  Oh, God.  Come on, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's not that great.  All right.  My mistake.  All right.  Good, good, good.  We thought we lost her examination.  Terrible.  We thought we lost you.  Let me see how big she is.  She's got to be...  Whoa.  How tall is she?  Oh, they said 6'8".  Right, right, right, right, right.  That's a 6'8".  6'8", man.  Yeah.  That's a...  Wow.  God bless her.  God bless her, then.  What does she do after basketball?  Does she stay in athletics?  You hope so. 
[00:30:00]  Imagine her walking to the law firm.  What are you going to do?  The big chick's cranky again.  Is the WNBA still happening?  I think it is, right?  Or did it fold?  God, I don't know.  I forget.  Yeah, right.  That's how bad it is.  I don't even know if it's a sport anymore.  Yeah, I know they were having problems, but I think maybe they survived.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Who cares?  Girls lacrosse, Ant.  Girls lacrosse?  No, man, because they cover up their faces and stuff.  Yeah, they're all covered up.  You've got to see their faces.  That's too brutal, too.  It's like, you know, it's fast moving. 
[00:30:30]  I like the dumb field hockey.  If you're going to be scoping out fucking youngsters.  I don't think there's a sport that comes close to girls wearing skirts and bending over the whole time.  Bent over.  If you're going to scope out some cooter.  I'm not going to.  You guys want to go scope out some cooter?  Cooter?  He's knocking a stupid fucking little ball around.  Did you guys hear Peyton Manning at the press conference yesterday?  No.  Oh, is he a dullard?  Oh, I know he knows how to fucking play and throw a football, but...  Ah, but he's got a hurt neck. 
[00:31:00]  He talks like he's half retarded.  Yeah.  Are we allowed to say retarded?  That's the R word.  I think there's 10 things in this first break I could get fired for.  Yeah.  Can you say that?  Yeah.  No.  I don't know.  Yes.  He looks retarded.  I think it's fair.  Begin the next chapter of my playing career for the Denver Broncos.  Broncos.  Starting with Mr. Bolin, I can tell this organization is committed to winning.  The Broncos, they do have incredible fans that love this team. 
[00:31:30]  And this truly is a special football environment.  I left Dayton, Ohio, with a bad personality and dreamed to be a dullard.  Glad that dream came true.  Boo-hoo.  If you can't get up for a press conference where you're announcing that you're going to make  about $95 million, we're a dullard.  We're just a great fit.  Fit.  I've always had a great deal of respect for John Elway.  He is one of the best quarterbacks.  Kiss the ring, motherfucker.  And his knowledge and respect for the game is evident in everything that he does. 
[00:32:00]  John Elway is a rock head.  Oh, boy.  What a lunk head.  He is a lunk head.  He looks like a rock-em-sock-em robot.  Robot?  He's got an ample forehead, doesn't he?  I let him know that I wanted to be a Denver Bronco.  I am thrilled to be here.  This went on forever, by the way.  I am thrilled to be.  Where am I?  Doing everything I can to help this franchise win another Super Bowl.  Franchise?  What about the team?  I'm going to wear number 18 for the Denver Broncos. 
[00:32:30]  I had the privilege of speaking with Frank Trapuca this morning.  Trapuca.  You had to take his number?  Great name.  I believe in everything I believe in, being a guy that appreciates the history of football,  I believe that a number is retired, it should stay retired.  But in talking to Frank Trapuca, I feel that he really wants me to wear his number.  No, he doesn't.  It was a very humbling conversation.  You got paid.  And I'm honored to wear his number.  God, why can't they be honest?  Another quarterback for the Denver Broncos.  Pause this.  Trapuca was.  What a, what a, what a, wait, what is, what are you, it's number 18. 
[00:33:00]  Basically, is 18 his number, I would assume, right?  I'm guessing.  Trapuca?  So, they retired his number, I guess?  Yeah.  18 got retired a while ago.  So this idiot needs to keep his fucking number.  So, so the Broncos said, fuck that, we retire this number, we'll take it out of retirement.  And this guy is okay with that?  He wouldn't be okay with that.  Yeah, why would you be okay?  It takes away his legacy.  Why would you be okay with that?  So how does that work?  Who knows this shit?  I guarantee that, I will guarantee they'd probably go to the guy and give him a nice payday. 
[00:33:30]  And say, look, we're taking your number back.  Why don't they just give him?  Fucking Manning wants it.  So here, how about a million dollars or whatever the fuck it would be?  Yeah, would you mind that?  No guy would want their number taken away from them if, if.  Well, that's his number, 18, like that's Manning's number?  Yeah.  I would assume.  So he wants, he wants his number, 18, but you know, with the Broncos, I guess, someone  help me out because you know more than me.  They retired a number for this Tripuka guy.  Tripuka.  What did Tripuka do that they retired his number?  Here comes Travis. 
[00:34:00]  There's no way a guy sits there and goes, oh yeah, please take my number.  Let's see Travis run like that right into the window like a parakeet.  Just bam, smash your face right against the window.  I don't think that, that's not a class move.  Who's Tripuka?  Tripuka.  He was their first quarterback.  Forever?  A long time ago?  Yeah.  Ever, ever.  So that's why they retired his number.  So first quarterback ever, they retire his number and now it's getting taken out of retirement?  So this guy is proud to give his number to Manning, which means no one's going to ever  remember Tripuka war 18.  Yeah, he said he wanted.  And then they'll never be able to retire the number again. 
[00:34:30]  They'll retire it maybe from fucking Manning.  They'll probably retire it again for him.  I doubt they would retire it from Manning.  So maybe he's borrowing it?  I mean, unless the guy goes and wins like, you know, three to five Super Bowls.  Or they'd retire it for both of them.  And it's just one of those weird things where it's tied in with both of their names.  No one's talking about Frank Tripuka.  But Manning would never allow that for terrible.  Retired for both of them.  If Manning wins the Super Bowl for Denver, then they retire 18 for fucking Pete Manning.  That's tough. 
[00:35:00]  I mean, a lot of quarterbacks have won Super Bowls for teams and they don't get their number  retired.  Did Frank Tripuka win anything or no?  I don't think so.  Why did you just tell Manning, you superstitious jizz bucket, wear another number?  But don't say that.  Because people like their numbers.  Oh, fucking.  They annoy me so much.  He is number 18.  I mean, the number is really important.  But it's not, though.  It's irrelevant.  To these guys, it's really important.  They're so weird.  But it works on, in both cases, Tripuka, whatever the hell his name is.  Tripuka.  He's not fucking proud to give his number to Manning. 
[00:35:30]  There's no way.  I wouldn't be proud of that name.  It's a horrible name.  He said it's an honor.  Then again, nobody's talking about Tripuka until now.  But he was told this is what's going to happen.  And maybe Peyton Manning fucking talked to him for 30 seconds.  You don't think they called him up and said, can I pretty please have your number?  No.  Please.  They said this is what's going down.  Come on, Tripuka.  They said this is what's going down.  You got any bills you need paid?  I'll pay some bills.  You're probably right.  I mean.  There's no way it's all nice like this shit.  It never is.  Does that someone know?  You know, Tripuka ain't set up for life. 
[00:36:00]  I think they offered him a split of merch somehow.  Any Manning merch?  Oh, man.  You get a piece of the Manning merch.  Maybe they don't have to.  But for PR reasons, I don't want him complaining.  I would bet there was some money.  There's got to be.  Because Ant brings up a great point.  He's not set for life.  Like, these football players that played, you know, up until the 90s, like, didn't make any money as far as sustaining, you know, a libel.  But going back to Jim's point, thank you, Nate and Hoboken. 
[00:36:30]  The Yankees have the number eight retired for both Yogi Berra and Elston Howard.  But I don't think Peyton Manning is the type of guy that's going to share number 18.  I don't think Peyton Manning is going to have his number retired.  No.  Why would he ever?  He would have to.  You're right.  He would have to have an amazing role.  Yeah, I mean, a five-year run, like, at the end of his career, it's going to be tough.  He's not going to make all five-year stuff.  You never know.  Maybe he wins three out of five.  And then Meatloaf has to change that song.  I'm just saying. 
[00:37:00]  Denver's got their contract good where they don't have to pay him every year if he doesn't pass a physical.  Could you go back to the Tripuka shit that bothers me?  Because it's obvious that it's all bullshit.  I had the privilege of talking.  You didn't even know who he was.  I had the privilege.  I was that money.  He didn't even know who Tripuka was.  What years did he play?  I'm thrilled to be here.  I'm looking forward to meeting my new teammates and doing everything I can to help this franchise win another Super Bowl.  I'm going to wear number 18 for the Denver Broncos. 
[00:37:30]  I had the privilege of speaking with Frank Tripuka this morning.  It really goes against everything I believe in, being a guy that appreciates the history of football.  I believe that a number is retired and you should stay retired.  But in talking to Frank Tripuka, I feel that he really wants me to wear his number.  Oh my God, that is bullshit.  No, why?  Because he feels bad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He feels bad and awkward that he's doing this.  I need my number.  So he needs to spin it. 
[00:38:00]  If he was being honest, he would have said, no thanks, I'll take another number.  Of course.  Right, right.  I believe in, you know, you don't take him.  He's feeling like the Broncos forced him to wear number 18.  Right.  How old is Frank Tripuka?  He is 84.  See, I don't know if Frank...  84.  I don't know if he doesn't want Manning to wear his number because people are talking about him again.  He'll get something out of it.  People are talking about him today.  But all year, his number will be talked about with Peyton Manning because he's wearing number 18.  All year, they'll fucking knock that name around.  All rang for the first time in years.  They will not knock his name around. 
[00:38:30]  Maybe not?  No.  No.  I mean, the only reason...  Because I really believe what Florentine was saying, that Peyton Manning is absolutely a diva in the end.  Oh, I mean, he comes off like it right there.  Like, obviously...  I just smell bullshit.  Nobody's believing, oh, I didn't want to wear the number, but they're forcing me to wear the number.  Right.  But after talking to him, I really believe he wants me to wear the number again.  He played four seasons for Denver.  The only reason his number's retired is because he was their first quarterback.  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck Frank Tripuka.  What are they?  He's 84. 
[00:39:00]  Go shit the bed.  I'm kidding.  I'm sure he's a nice man.  I got to practice.  What's going on in this country?  Oh, that's a good one.  That's what I'm practicing.  Yeah, yeah.  For Fox and Friends?  Fox and Friends.  Yeah.  Oh, come on!  I'm going to do one of those, too.  Come on!  It's not Fox and Assholes.  What are you doing?  Be friendly.  Yeah, well, we'll see.  Oh.  We're going to simulcast it.  Oh, we have to.  Oh, don't.  It's probably not going to be going to simulcast it.  No, I want to hear it.  We got to simulcast it.  But it's like, what are you talking about?  It's going to happen!  Oh, that's a good one.  I should do that.  Use that one.  Say something about, I think, I think Romney's going to get the nomination. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, looking now like Romney is going to get the nomination.  Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Stuck up your fucking ass!  All right, I'll see you guys in a few.  What, you really leaving now?  Yeah.  He's got to go to Fox and Friends.  But we were doing this thing.  I got to print a smaller copy of my notes.  Oh.  Exit polls.  Fun stuff.  Yes.  Have fun, Jimmy.  All right, God, I'll see you.  You'll be back, right?  Jimmy's coming back by 735.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy will be back.  See, why do you do that? 
[00:40:00]  He's running over to next door.  And then he's going to run back and be here by 735.  Wouldn't you take your time?  I'd take the whole day.  I would walk around Times Square.  I'd be like, I'm doing Fox and Friends.  I'd get a cup of coffee.  I'd show back up around 830.  Like, I got to take the day.  But Jimmy, like, he's going to be on Fox and Friends in like 15 minutes.  Yeah.  I would have been a long guy.  Run in, run on.  Look, he's coming back even.  There he is.  I forgot the phone.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, Fox and Friends on the way.  Awkward.  Oh, Jim.  You want your ID?  Oh, no.  For serious? 
[00:40:30]  Good morning.  Why don't you rub it?  Good morning.  Rub that ID.  Rub it morning.  Good morning.  Welcome a rub morning to board.  Welcome a board.  Good morning.  Rub your card.  Rub your card.  Fox and Chips.  Oh, no.  All right.  I'll try to get a sis.  Oh, please do.  Are you going to get a sis?  Please do.  What's that?  Yeah, what's that?  But it had to be subtle.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to go on again.  Yeah.  They're going to love you.  They're going to love you.  I don't know about that.  I'm going to leave my belt sticking out like this, like I'm a wild Randy guy who just walked 
[00:41:00]  in.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good look.  Lead with your belt.  Hello.  Welcome a board.  Rub your card.  Oh, look.  Now, Jim went all business.  I'm an asshole.  Rub your card.  Welcome a board.  Travis called me an asshole.  I was a fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Travis called me an idiot.  Welcome a board.  Rub your card.  Rub your card.  Can we do the rest of this clip?  It's almost over.  Yeah.  I'm honored to wear his number, being another quarterback for the Denver Broncos, as Mr.  Trapuca was back years ago as the first quarterback to play here.  So it truly is an honor for me, and I'm really following his wishes to wear it because 
[00:41:30]  that's what he wants me to do.  Boy.  And I'm honored to do that.  See, he keeps saying it.  Thank you very much.  He keeps saying that because he feels a little guilty.  I guess he said on March 9th, Trapuca said that if the Broncos sign him, he can wear  his number.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  So like weeks ago, but still.  I mean.  They probably sent a hit squad over his house.  I'm kidding.  You're going to go on and you're going to fucking say that you don't care.  I doubt that was the deciding factor for Peyton Manning.  What do you think the thing to do is there? 
[00:42:00]  Change your number if you're Peyton Manning?  Obviously, it's a tough call.  Yeah.  I mean.  He wants 18 to do his whole career.  A lot of these sports people really are attached to their numbers.  Really attached.  Or some people.  Some people, if number 18 was retired, they would take 81.  I've seen that happen before.  And then just flip the number.  Look at it in a mirror all the time.  Yeah.  Go, hey, look.  I'm still 18.  Just turn your shirt inside out.  Oh, that too.  Yeah.  So why has Tebow surfaced yet as far as talking about this situation? 
[00:42:30]  No, because he's still a Denver Bronco.  He can't say anything right now.  He hasn't been traded.  He wants to be traded, right?  Oh, no.  Probably.  He probably wants to play.  He's nobody now over there.  Yeah, but one hit and Peyton goes down and then you're back to fucking Tebow Mania.  That's true.  Is it Tebow Mania?  I get confused with Linsanity.  Linsanity.  It was Linsanity.  It's not Linsanity.  It's Linsanity.  That's what number one sports fan said.  He says Linsanity?  Yeah.  What does that mean? 
[00:43:00]  Number one sports fan.  And what does the paper say today?  They want to call it Tim Sanity?  Tebow Sanity?  What does he say?  It doesn't even make sense.  Turn it over.  The other paper then.  What's the headline?  Tim Sanity.  Tim Sanity, right.  Tim Sanity.  Enough with the Sanity.  If the Jets get him, it's going to be Tim Sanity.  Oh, God.  That doesn't work.  They have to trade him.  You think?  Yes.  Yeah, because if Peyton isn't good, the fans will start cheering for Tebow, and then John  Elway is just going to have a giant issue on his hands. 
[00:43:30]  I bet you that I...  He's got to get him out of there.  If you believe everything Florentine was saying and that Peyton's kind of a diva, I don't  know if this made the air, but you're right.  One bad game, and you've got 80,000 fucking fans screaming, Tebow, Tebow.  Peyton doesn't want to hear that shit.  So he wants that out of the equation where that's not even a possibility.  You don't think that even if they trade him, if he has a bad game, they're not going to  chant that anyway?  Oh, they will anyway.  They will anyway.  You're right.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  You're right.  But he doesn't get to go in.  Yeah.  Because then he goes in and has a really good game right in front of Peyton Manning's face.  So, yeah.  Montana switched his number when he left San Fran.  There you go.  That's a man doing the right thing.  Robert, what do you know about this?  No, I just remember when Joe Montana was in San Francisco, he had 16, and then there was  just a shame out here to lose Joe Montana.  When he went to Kansas City's free agent, they gave him number 19 because 16 was already  retired. 
[00:44:30]  There you go.  But Joe Montana's just a great guy.  Well, of course he is.  Joe Montana won four Super Bowls, so this is like Peyton Manning proves what you're talking  about, his divaness.  Yeah.  Yeah, because Montana is obviously an amazing quarterback.  He could have got 16.  Some would argue he's the greatest quarterback of all time.  Right.  Whoa.  He could have easily got 16.  Oh, yeah.  Why argue?  Exactly.  But he did the right thing because he understands the tradition of fucking football and retiring  numbers.  Retiring the number, it's not like a fucking person where it can come out of retirement. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  It's fucking done.  Yeah.  That number is for somebody.  Not you.  Yeah.  It's not yours.  Not yours.  Thank you, Robert.  I mean, the Colts already retired Manning's number the second they cut him.  Yeah.  You know?  There he is up on the TV now.  God damn.  He is just a duller.  He really is.  Just a bore fest.  I don't know.  Is this Jimmy? 
[00:45:30]  Hello?  Who's not?  Why do they pick up the hotline?  Now we got to wait?  Well, because what if it's not?  Who cares?  We'll be stuck.  It's either Jay Moore or Jim Norton.  I mean, come on.  Who are we kidding?  I'm just waiting.  Huh?  There's someone else it could be.  Oh, yeah?  Who is it?  It's Kenny.  Why is it Kenny?  Kenny's asking if we could take a break because Jimmy will be on at 7.15.  Kenny's producing the program. 
[00:46:00]  No, Busy Body's producing the program now.  Oh, shit.  Kenny's panicking.  We're going to simulcast Jim Norton on Fox & Friends.  I guess Kenny wants us to go to break.  He says take a break.  We got to take a break.  Oh, you found the T-bow?  Yeah.  The T-bow-y?  T-bow-y.  Jimmy Fallon did another T-bow-y song.  Oh, did he?  I liked it.  I didn't see it.  That's pretty good.  I'll reserve judgment.  Make sure it's okay with Kenny.  Yeah, we better.  All right.  We're going to break, and hopefully we'll simulcast Jim Norton on Fox & Friends and do some other things. 
[00:46:30]  So you stay there.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  Sirius XM.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel a hunger that tries to keep a man awake at night. 
[00:47:00]  Are you the answer?  I shouldn't wonder.  When I feel you wet my appetite.  With all the power you're releasing.  It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone.  Anticipation is running through me.  Let's find the key and turn this engine on.  I can feel you breathe.  I can feel your heart beat faster. 
[00:47:30]  Take me home tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light.  Take me home tonight.  Listen, honey.  Just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  Be my little baby.  Be my little baby.  Just like Ronnie sang. 
[00:48:00]  I say, just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  Baby, baby.  Baby, my little baby.  Baby, my little baby.  Baby, my little baby.  I feel a hunger.  It's a hunger.  Take me tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light.  Take me home tonight.  Listen, honey. 
[00:48:30]  Just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question We Didn't Get.  Television star and one-time heartthrob, Jason Priestley. 
[00:49:00]  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Jason Priestley.  Jason, what type of fuel does your car take?  My car takes premium unleaded.  Thank you so much for your time.  All right.  You bet.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a guest we couldn't get on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Serious, serious, serious accents.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Waiting for Jimmy to show up on the TV. 
[00:49:30]  Jim Norton's going to be on Fox & Friends if you want to watch that any minute but now, right?  I don't know.  7.15, I think.  7.15, but Kenny made us break and we probably, you know, broke a little early.  Of course we did.  Because now there's really not enough time to get into anything too deep.  Of course.  But we still have time to wait before Jimmy comes on. 
[00:50:00]  We kind of know how to do this, Kenny.  But Kenny made us break, so.  And we wanted to prove our point, so we broke when he thought we should break.  So now we've got this five-minute filler shit we've got to do.  I've got this five-minute forbidden zone.  Of course.  You can't do anything in five minutes.  Nah, not really.  I heard Eddie Money in there, though.  Oh.  Is that topical?  Well, EROC told me we didn't have time to get topical because we, you know, had to get ready for the Jim Norton Fox & Friends thing. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  But now it's very obvious that we could have done the getting topical with EROC.  Oh, okay.  Because they're just doing news right now.  By the way, do we have Channel 5's Fox up, or do we just have Fox?  What do you mean?  No, it's Fox & Friends.  It's Fox & Friends, okay.  Yeah, no, it's the national show he's doing.  It wasn't.  He's not doing local, right?  No.  Oh, okay.  Oh, it's the national show.  Kenny broke when you told us to, and now see what happens?  No, I didn't tell you to.  No?  What do you mean you didn't tell?  I made a phone call to make sure that you guys broke in time and we're back in time. 
[00:51:00]  We know that, though.  Yeah, so I had to say, like, now.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now we got to play.  Now, so who screwed up?  Who do we blame?  I think the phone screener.  Who do we blame, Kenny?  The phone screener?  The phone screener.  Yeah.  Why are you breathing heavy?  Were you running?  No, I'm not breathing heavy.  I have sinus problems.  He does.  He was telling me on the way in. 
[00:51:30]  He goes, I'm allergic to everything green.  Yeah.  And his allergy started last week.  I know what we can discuss very quickly.  We're discussing your allergies.  Let's discuss the show I created, Busy Buddies.  No, no.  Oh, boy.  They have a new segment.  What is it called?  Whore Talk with Nicole Biggums.  Really?  Oh, shit.  You're doing bits now?  We should play a recap of that show.  What did she say yesterday?  She said the studio stunk like dude.  Yeah.  She said that?  Yeah.  She was very upset with the way the studio smelled. 
[00:52:00]  Well, there were a few bad farts yesterday.  I remember one in particular.  That wasn't the highlight, though.  What happened?  What did she admit yesterday?  She said she prefers when she's going down on a girl that the girl be shaved, not unshaven.  She licks box?  She has licked box.  She was talking about some wild sexploits she had back in the day.  Yep.  And still, the marriage, the upcoming nuptials.  That's not going to last.  No.  She's going to miss the cock.  Do you know why it's not going to last?  Why? 
[00:52:30]  When she tries to jam a finger in her boyfriend's ass, he clenches up.  She also admitted that.  What?  That's like a cornerstone of a good marriage.  Yeah.  So, you know.  Oh, boy.  That guy.  I told her she should put a finger in, but she said he clenches up.  Yeah.  Oh, she's so not going to be married this time next year.  We tried to tell her that.  Should we get, like, a poll going?  And she loves strange cock.  Yeah, she said.  You heard.  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, she needs miles of cock.  She's listening intently.  That's always.  Maybe the guy's going to allow her to get some side gick. 
[00:53:00]  I don't think so.  Or maybe they do.  Like a cuck?  I mean, I don't know.  He's going to be a cuck?  Why the hell is she getting married, then?  Because she's, you know, she's going to be 30.  Her eggs are getting a little, uh.  She feels like, yeah, it's time.  Yeah, he's trying to talk him into threesomes.  But Troy said that he believes that she will stop being wild with her husband and instead  find other guys to be wild with.  Yeah.  That could happen.  Hey, uh, the threesome she had on the beach.  Was that a guy, guy, her? 
[00:53:30]  No.  Or two girls and a guy.  She doesn't like two guys.  No?  No rotisserie for her?  She's selfish.  Who was the guy?  Some guy.  So she didn't know the guy either?  I mean, I'm sure she knew him.  Oh, man.  But they were on a beach and some Mexican guy was watching him.  Oh, Jesus.  She's wild.  Is he beaten off?  Probably.  She doesn't think so.  Yeah.  Probably.  She's wild.  She's on Hits 1, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that like almost family programming?  It is family programming.  It is family programming?  And then she comes on here and exposes a different soul. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  People have no idea that she's wild.  No.  She's got a wild side to her.  Boy, she does.  I mean, she's a confessed lover of the dick.  She loves the cops.  She loves it.  So much.  Yeah.  Like, that's the big thing about getting married, how much she will miss strange penis.  Right.  And this is a new segment on the Busy Buddy Show?  I mean, if that's what you want to call the show, there's no segments.  There's no name.  Kenny is fucking programming your hour now.  He created the show.  Programming our show.  We might as well. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.  It obviously does a good job.  Go to break.  Go to break.  Iraq played Eddie Money because our pal is 63 today.  63.  We got to get Eddie Money back in studio.  It's been a while.  Wow.  Or maybe not.  Eddie Money.  Yeah.  He was.  As I recall, he was a fucking nut.  It was fun to have on.  He was cuckoo.  Yeah.  Oh, money sanity, I think.  It doesn't work.  Eddie, Eddie Sanity.  Monsanity. 
[00:55:00]  Mun, mun.  None of it works.  Mun lunatic.  By the way, I've been asked a lot.  We figured out the Cleveland thing.  Yes.  And the reason being because we bitched like a little fucking, or I certainly did.  They had no church.  I bitched like a little bitch.  They had no church in the matter.  No, G.H.  When you're right, you're right.  I bitched like a little bitch.  And guess what?  When you're right, you're right.  Now we're going to Cleveland.  Now we're going to Cleveland.  On our terms.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Cleveland.  Yeah, I'm psyched.  I'm psyched about that. 
[00:55:30]  Where's Jimmy?  Is it this?  Fox and Friends.  It's coming up.  Here we go.  Da-da-da.  Illinois Primary.  Years of too many apologies and not enough jobs.  Bottle doodle.  Historic drops in income and historic highs in gas prices.  A president who doesn't hesitate to use all the means necessary to force through Obamacare  on the American public.  He's got a weird stat.  But leads from behind in the world.  It's time to say these words. 
[00:56:00]  This word.  Enough.  Oh, watch.  It was a big victory.  Wow, I got scared.  I thought I was dropping some N-bombs.  It was in Obama's home state of Illinois and transferring the competition in doing so.  Take a look at those numbers.  And take a look at the Fox News exit poll.  It shows that beating the president was the number one quality among Illinois voters.  And Mitt Romney got that.  Go either way if you went with that word, right?  True.  So who do voters think you're the best man to win in November?  Might have got the medal.  An overwhelming 60% say it's Mitt Romney.  Here to discuss, here's our political panel.  First time ever together.  Poster Michael Maslansky is here.  Who? 
[00:56:30]  Attorney and former prosecutor Liz Mandarino is here.  And comedian Jim Norton is also here.  We can all analyze the performance last night.  We can analyze his performance.  Because he's at Caroline's this weekend, correct?  No, next weekend.  Next weekend.  Don't go this weekend.  No, this weekend I'm going to be in an adult bookstore.  Right.  Fantastic.  Again, there was a reason why we didn't promo that.  All right.  So let's talk about Mitt Romney.  What changed today?  Do you think that he's more likable now, Michael?  Well, I think the numbers suggest that he is more likable.  He's getting a bigger percentage of people who think that he can relate to average Americans than he has before. 
[00:57:00]  He's got almost a third.  The conservatives seem to be coalescing to a greater extent than in the past around him.  He's won among conservatives.  He won among Tea Party voters.  This is a really good story for Romney.  And it's a tougher sell for Santorum to get up there and say that he's making progress.  Even in this, it kind of admittedly mides.  Jimmy should reach over and squeeze that girl's tits.  He has actually done well, as usual, with people who make over $100,000.  College graduates seem to like him.  He won the Catholic vote again.  The moderate vote, not a surprise.  But Tea Party support is significant. 
[00:57:30]  He basically went to a dead heat with Rick Santorum.  What?  I think he did very well with the Tea Parties, and I'm impressed by that.  Jimmy's voice is high on Fox.  But I don't think he's a particularly likable candidate as much as he is a tolerable candidate for the Republicans.  I would slam her.  You can tolerate him.  Yes.  Well, I personally can't, but I think the Republicans can.  Now, Jim, a lot of people can't tolerate you, but that has nothing to do with this conversation.  I know, just because I'm too handsome.  But, Jim, in the big picture, do you think he's becoming more likable last night talking only about the president, not about his other Republicans? 
[00:58:00]  I just love the fact that we think he's relatable to most Americans.  He's worth $200 million.  He earned it.  I'm not saying he doesn't deserve as much, but nobody relates to that.  I think Ron Paul is like $5 million, and Santorum is like $5 million.  None of these guys have ever had to stand in the supermarket and complain to the manager that the coin store machine was ripping them off.  None of them relate to average Americans.  Right.  Is that a requirement to be president?  You have to relate to average Americans on some level.  Biden might, and maybe because he's worth $69, he's worth $250. 
[00:58:30]  Like, Biden might have some relation, but none of these guys have any connection to average Americans.  It's coming off like a limb.  You could also say that Mitt Romney started with nothing.  He didn't get an inheritance from his dad.  He was living in a two-room apartment.  They're beating up our Jimmy.  They're beating up our Jimmy.  Come on, Jimmy.  Well, he can relate to the early struggles, but since then he hasn't been able to relate to the general population, and that's his big problem.  I mean, that's going to be the problem in the general election that he's going to face.  He's going to have a tough uphill battle.  He does look the most presidential.  Like, if I had to look at somebody in the white house, Gingrich is a Lego person.  Santorum looks like a creepy social studies teacher. 
[00:59:00]  So if I had to vote for somebody who I like the way they look, I would say Romney because he does look presidential.  Right.  They're all fine people.  That's just your take on that.  Oh, God.  So representing average Americans is a problem.  What about working women, Michael?  Well, I think we've got this narrative out there now that Santorum has a problem with women.  He doesn't even understand that was humor.  Oh, my God.  He didn't do well among women overall.  He did even worse among working women.  And so I think to the extent that any candidate isn't doing well with them, it's going to be wrong.  What's wrong with that guy?  What's with that preemptive?  Well, as a woman on the panel, I think that, you know, Illinois is much more reflective of the states that are going to be toss-up states. 
[00:59:30]  He cannot relate to women at all.  And the states that are coming up states in Connecticut, even Pennsylvania, Santorum's home state, he's going to have a really hard time with women.  Bedroom eyes, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have no idea what she's saying.  I do not see him too well.  Overflow crowd last night.  She was a prosecutor?  Jim, women?  Wow.  Well, I don't know how women feel about him, to be honest with you.  I just know he's anti-porn.  And it's like, Rick, what do you expect me to do?  Okay, fine.  What?  Interesting close.  Jim, I wasn't expecting.  That's an important point.  A home run. 
[01:00:00]  Jim, Liz and Michael, thank you very much.  And you've got to go back to Opie and Anthony.  Yes, I do.  Well, we enjoyed having you here.  Thank you.  All right, 20 minutes now after the hour.  Moving ahead.  Caught in the act.  What happened, Kenny?  Well, you're supposed to be conserving energy.  Back to Opie and Anthony sadly?  Did he say sadly?  I don't know.  I don't think he did.  What did he say there, man?  That guy's a douche.  Wasn't he on our show once, or was it the other guy?  I always forget.  No, he was on once promoting a book about baseball that he wrote.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That didn't go anywhere.  God, he didn't even understand Jimmy was going for some human.  Oh, it's like, well, that's you. 
[01:00:30]  That's you.  That's all good guys.  It's up a soundbite, and we get in trouble because of what you said.  Right.  Oh, God.  Stop.  Wow.  All right.  Wow, that was honestly a waste of Jimmy's time.  Of course.  He said, sadly, you have to go.  Well, he probably meant sadly you have to go.  Like, we'd like to have you here.  Not like sadly that you've got to come back here.  Brian Kilmeade is the dumbest motherfucker ever.  That's coming in.  I don't know if he's dumb, but he's a scaredy cat. 
[01:01:00]  He doesn't even recognize that Jimmy was going for a little humor.  Yeah, that was very, he was so scared of Jimmy there.  Yeah.  Jimmy was just making fun of what these guys look like.  What's wrong with that?  Oh.  I said Newt Gingrich looks like a weeble wobble.  A weeble's wobble, but they don't fall down.  He looks like a weeble's wobble.  And Romney looks like an angry bird.  Think about it.  A little.  And Santorum, I always said, looked like Mr. Potato Head. 
[01:01:30]  Santorum.  Because he has those weird, you look at his face and you feel like some of the Mr. Potato Head parts are not there.  Yeah.  He has like tiny eyebrows, a tiny little mouth like you didn't put the mouth on yet.  He's proportioned like some guy that has issues.  He definitely looks like a guy that has some kind of issues that should get him in some sort of trouble.  I'm telling you, there's something going on with him.  Yeah.  I don't know if he's officially done anything crazy that's going to come out, but there's something going on in that guy's head that he can't handle when he's alone at night with his thoughts. 
[01:02:00]  Wow, what a waste of Jimmy's time that was.  Yeah, you got two knuckleheads.  Well, Liz was hot.  Well, that girl, I want to get the Jimmy lowdown on that girl.  He was sitting next to her.  He probably gave her the look up and down.  And the other guy thought, you know, this is my big moment.  Oh, yeah.  Fox is going to fucking hire me for a show.  Yeah, this is my big moment to like say, hey, you, he earned his money. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, hey, why is that bad?  Hey.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  You want to play this?  Do it.  Whoa.  Let's play this Mitt Romney thing.  Yeah.  And then we'll take a break.  And when we get back, Jim Norton will be back on this show.  Is it okay with Kenny?  Where he belongs.  Take a break.  Double check with Kenny.  Oh, yeah.  Please do.  Will the real Mitt Romney please stand up?  Yeah, I guess this is getting a little attention today.  Someone took Romney clips and edited it very nicely. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And it goes, sounds like an Eminem thing.  Ah.  Do you want to listen to it?  Give it a listen.  A lot of people are liking this.  We'll see if we like it and our audience likes it.  Uh, I just think he ought to be honest with the American people and try to win as the  real Mitt Romney.  Meet the real Mitt Romney.  Who is the real Romney?  No one really knows who the real Mitt Romney is.  He's an enigma and he's a dad and a family man.  Who is the real Romney?  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. 
[01:03:30]  Can I have your attention, please?  Can I have your attention, please?  Will the real Mitt Romney please stand up?  I repeat.  Will the real Mitt Romney please stand up?  We're going to have a problem here.  Y'all act like you haven't seen a Mormon before.  George, down on the floor.  I'm not concerned about the very poor.  Got it wrong.  Sorry, that's not what I meant.  I want every American to be at the top 1%.  I'm really named Willard.  That's my first name. 
[01:04:00]  I'm not looking for a colony on the moon.  Just for someone to blame.  I like being able to fire people.  I'm Newt Gingrich.  You're fired.  I'm Rick Santorum and I'm fired.  Boom, boom, boom.  Conservative women.  Love Mitt Romney.  And I love cars.  I love lakes.  I'm running for office for Pete's sake.  With regards to abortion.  Pro-life.  Pro-choice.  I firmly believe in my own singing voice.  For Purple Mountain's majesty.  Above the fruited plain.  Fruited.  What?  Where are we at, John? 
[01:04:30]  With regards to abortion.  You can choose.  Your own adventure.  It's a Republican dimension.  And I'm more concerned about the banks.  They're unable to lend.  Corporations are people, my friend.  My dog is on the roof.  My dog is on the roof.  Who knows the dogs out?  Who?  Who?  Understand I'm an exception.  The Obama contraception.  Not a bult.  I'm an eagle.  I'm going to get my lawn cut by illegals.  There will be an influx.  Hispanic voters in trucks.  Look, if you don't believe.  I'll tell you what.  10,000 bucks?  Well, I made a lot of money.  Matter of factually.  So I drove a couple of Cadillacs, actually.  I have emotion and passion.  That's a joke for the record. 
[01:05:00]  But if you want the soul of America restored, come on board.  Take your fair share in every Mormon.  Raise your underwear.  Sing the chorus.  Up a bear.  I'm Mitt Romney and I'm the real Romney.  All the other Mitt Romneys are just masturbating.  So with the real Mitt Romney.  Please stand up.  Please stand up.  Please stand up.  I'm Mitt Romney and I'm the real Romney.  All the other Mitt Romneys are just masturbating.  So with the real Mitt Romney.  Please stand up.  Please stand up.  Please stand up.  Boom, boom, boom.  I'm Mitt Romney and I'm the real Romney.  All the other Mitt Romneys are just masturbating. 
[01:05:30]  So with the real Mitt Romney.  Please stand up.  Please stand up.  Please stand up.  I'm Mitt Romney, and I'm the real Romney.  All the other Mitt Romneys are just masturbating.  So with the real Mitt Romney, please stand up.  Please stand up.  Please stand up.  That's not bad.  That must have taken a while.  No kidding.  Not bad.  Jeez Louise.  That video definitely has a lot of attention today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I don't think they're playing it on the news, though, right?  Oh, no.  No, it's too dirty.  Too scary.  It's dirty is what it is. 
[01:06:00]  All right, we'll do a quick break, and Jim Norton comes back.  And we got Chris Jericho coming in today.  Uh-oh.  We got to discuss his beef with CM Punk.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Sam's just going to be jacking off in the corner.  Oh, look.  Oh, he's talking wrestling.  Oh.  Never mind Sam in the corner.  He's messing.  Oh, Sam's just jacking it to you.  Oh, here's Jimmy.  We don't have to take a break.  Good. 
[01:06:30]  There's Jimmy.  Look at Jimmy.  You were just on the TV.  Yes, I was.  We just saw you on the television box.  We liked that Liz girl.  She looked very sexy.  Yeah, what was up with that girl?  She was nice.  She was cool.  She had a bed head.  Did she look hot?  Dreamy bedroom eyes.  In person?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was nice.  Yeah.  I was looking at her like, oh.  She was trying to rap with me a little bit.  I was like, radio baby.  I got to go.  Ah, I got to split, yo.  Brian Kilmeade, like.  What was that when he said, hey, that's your.  Because I said that he's a creepy social studies teacher. 
[01:07:00]  He looks.  He was talking about what he looks like.  Yeah, I know.  That's fine.  You're going for humor, obviously.  And he's like, oh, well, that's what you think.  They're all good guys.  Brian's a good dude.  He's afraid.  Like, they're all worried that you're going to say the wrong thing.  Everybody's scared that, like.  It's too bad.  You're going to say the wrong thing and get in trouble.  It was obvious that it was, you know, humor.  Of course.  But they're all worried.  He panicked.  Yeah.  Panicky Pete.  Yeah, that's what I'm very happy I said it.  Say it again.  Of course.  Yes.  Yeah, we were looking at her like, oh, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  We almost forgot you were on TV.  I don't blame you.  The temptation is to jump in and yap.  But it's like, it's a panel that everybody talks.  It's fine.  Panels.  It went well.  It was all right.  Kilmeade just.  They all worry.  No matter who the anchor is there, they all worry that you're going to say something  that's going to get them fired.  Because you're alive.  And they know they can't just cut you.  I thought you were the anchor.  Did you see Jimmy?  It was just.  No, it was great. 
[01:08:00]  I need coffee.  Ah.  But I was happy he got the O&A plug in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's good.  Did he say, unfortunately, he had to go back to them?  Sadly.  Sadly.  Sadly.  Because Kenny jumped in on that.  He's a busybody, Kenny.  He's starting to shit out of nothing.  No, he just meant, sadly, you've got to leave.  Of course he was.  Regardless of where he was going.  He's being polite.  Yep.  Jab.  You're a dope bookstore lineman.  Thank you.  I didn't plan that one.  Yes.  A dope bookstore.  Yeah, Liz is kind of cute.  Yeah, there's something there, I think. 
[01:08:30]  What do you do?  How are you doing, Mom?  She's like nice lips.  Where are you from?  Nice lips.  Should have wrapped her a little bit.  She went out for a little, like, a little soda.  What?  A malt.  A little foot.  I'm supposed to be on next week, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, we'll see if they don't cancel me.  Oh.  They shouldn't.  Why would they?  You didn't do anything bad there.  You were a good boy.  You were a good boy.  You were a good boy, Jimmy.  Throwing out some lines.  Making them panic a little.  Perfect.  It's just amazing to, honestly, it's amazing to me that anyone thinks of a guy who makes 
[01:09:00]  200 million can connect to the average American.  You can't.  He earned his money.  Yeah, but I'm not saying he doesn't deserve his money, but don't act like you can relate  to a guy who's making fucking 50 grand a year.  You can't.  Right.  Or 30 grand.  You can't.  Yeah, because he's trying to play it both ways.  Like, I'm just like you.  I don't think anybody that's ever been the president can relate to the normal, the common  man.  But wasn't Romney's father pretty damn rich to begin with?  So, I mean, did Romney actually make his own money, or did he have a good head start? 
[01:09:30]  He probably made his own money, yeah.  But he had a good head start, I'm thinking.  Nothing wrong with it, but whatever.  You can't relate to any of these guys.  Even Obama is fucking rich.  He makes it $7 million he's worth.  I believe so, yeah.  Yeah.  There's no relating.  Stop it.  Then his wife apparently has more assistance than any other first lady, and she's fucking,  you know, taking vacations everywhere.  She's loving being first lady. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, man.  She is using up the resources.  And his daughters, I don't like the fact that he takes, his daughters go to Mexico when there's  a travel embargo.  And it's like, do you know how much money that's costing?  I know that maybe, again, we speculate, maybe the Mexicans pay for that because it's good  PR for them.  Yeah, yeah.  So they may actually pay that expense.  Maybe it's actually cheaper.  I guess that's where she wanted to go.  Yeah, but how about when you're the president's daughter, you're a tremendous target for kidnappers.  How about you just don't?  How about you go somewhere to spring break like you just go to fucking Jersey or something? 
[01:10:30]  It's like an action movie that you would come up with.  The first lady or the first daughter goes to Mexico.  Yeah, she gets separated from a group.  Yeah, yeah.  And has to escape.  Oh, man.  And then she steals guns and she fights her way back to freedom.  Oh, you think that would be headlines?  You think there'd be a lot of headlines if that happened?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You think the whole world would stop?  Oh, with the Mexicans panicking.  Oh, man.  There'd be drones and bombers flying over the country.  Although in Mexico, if they did, for them, it would probably just be for money. 
[01:11:00]  Like, she would have a shot, I think, at being okay because for there it's money.  If it was Al-Qaeda, you're finished.  Because that's a much bigger thing for them.  Would you have to drop nukes at that point?  Yeah, I think they'd drop nukes at that point.  You've got to drop some fucking tactical nukes.  Speaking of Obama, what's the problem with De Niro's joke there?  And what was the joke?  And do we have audio of the joke?  He said something about, am I looking at the president? 
[01:11:30]  Is he looking at me?  Bobby, you're so funny.  He said something about, he named Santorum Gingrich's wife and Romney's wife.  And he said to the audience, he said, come on, are we actually ready for a, I don't think  it's, I don't think we're ready for a first white first lady.  Yeah.  She's joking.  That's funny.  There's nothing to it.  Yeah.  Saying that he wants more Michelle Obama.  And the reality is, his fucking wife is black.  Right.  Like, Gingrich should shut the fuck up, and all of them should shut the fuck up.  And I know there's a double standard in the media, but just because there's a double standard 
[01:12:00]  in the media, it doesn't mean you should fuck with De Niro for saying that.  Yeah, Gingrich said it's inexcusable.  He's a douchebag.  He's a fat douchebag.  I guess it's more, it's more acceptable to just go fucking around on your wife, fatso.  Is that it?  You know, it's the fact that the Democrats have just made sport of anything that somebody  on the right says, and has called them out, and has made them lose their jobs.  I mean, that's happened so many times.  They're definitely the speech police, the Democrats, as far as political correctness 
[01:12:30]  and race speech goes.  So, for De Niro to say something like that in front of the president, it just evokes race.  And any time you talk about race for some fucking reason, it's a bad thing.  I don't think the president was there.  Wasn't he at another fundraiser?  He was the first lady.  Was it?  Oh, the first lady was there.  He was actually there.  He was coming out.  Oh, okay.  And De Niro issued a standard, he's like, look, my ego is what I said, even though it was  ingest or whatever the word he used, it was never meant to embarrass anyone. 
[01:13:00]  Why is that a problem?  It's exhausting.  On that level, we have trained people to be so sanitized and phony.  It's like we don't allow for a verbal misstep by anybody.  So, if this continues, we'll just get joking.  We'll ban joking, right?  Yeah.  What's wrong with just joking about shit?  Nothing.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Especially when it's so obvious there's no hate involved.  At least start there.  Jesus.  But this is obviously a comeback because of what's happened in the past with things like, 
[01:13:30]  you know, Rush and shit like that.  Uh, and, and I still say the Democrats are a lot worse than the Republicans when it comes  to being the fucking police of, of people's speech.  When I don't mean on the radio and things like that.  I just mean the second you bring up anything race related and you're not a liberal Democrat,  you're going to get fucked.  They're, they're sickeningly, excuse me, hypocritical thing is race.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Whereas the conservatives typically go after sexual stuff.  Right, right, right.  And gay stuff.  Like, oh, believe me, I'm not giving them a pass, Jimmy.  But you're right.  They're more, racially, it's usually the Democrats that go after you much faster and much harder  for it.  I would agree with that, yeah.  Yeah, the second you trip up and say something that, that can be perceived as racist, it's  always the fucking liberals and the Democrats that jump on you.  Right.  The Republicans are never like, hey, you said something, sounded racist.  No.  Do we have Newt Gingrich's clip on this?  He's all pissed off. 
[01:14:30]  Why is he pissed?  He's just trying to get attention for himself.  He wants some attention because he's a fat douchebag.  I really.  50 cent gas, please vote for me.  Fucking, what a tool.  Well, let me, uh, let me thank all of you for being here.  The, uh, that felt a little bit awkward about all the folks outside, but I guess it's a lot  better to have an overflow than an underflow, so.  Leave your wife.  What?  And I'm, and we're both, the folks and I are both allowed to be here.  Rub your marriage.  What, what, say something?  And I just want to thank all of you for making the effort to come out this morning. 
[01:15:00]  We appreciate your support.  Who is she?  Oh, hateable.  Oh, thank you.  Every single one.  I do want to say one thing on behalf of, uh, both my wife, uh, and on behalf of Karen  Which one?  Pause.  What, what are you going to say?  I'm sorry to number three.  Yeah.  That I was fucking her when I was with number two, or at least thinking about fucking her.  Shut up, Newt.  Yeah.  Shut your fat face.  Newt really can't say anything.  Wouldn't it be nice if one guy came out and went, ah, he was kidding. 
[01:15:30]  Exactly.  God, oh, none of these phones do that shit.  And I don't give a fuck what side of you.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  I don't care.  I was kidding.  You're right.  I was kidding.  I was kidding.  I was kidding.  Oh.  You're in Elvira.  I'm in Elvira.  I would have, I would have so much respect for that guy if you just said the, you know,  I said what you said.  Sorry.  If any of them, he was just joking and supporting the first lady.  Good for him.  Who cares?  Move on.  I have so much respect.  We have more things to talk about.  If one of these blowhard jizz bags didn't jump on it. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  That to me would get much more mileage.  Although it wouldn't get the coverage.  Nobody would cover it because it's not inflammatory.  That's true.  Yeah.  Nobody would care.  Let's hear what Newt had to say about this.  Ann Romney, and that is, I think Robert De Niro is wrong.  I think the country's ready for a new first lady and he doesn't have to describe it in  racial terms.  There's nothing, these are fine ladies as is Michelle Obama, but this is not about the  first lady.  It's about the president. 
[01:16:30]  And that's where De Niro missed the whole point.  He was kidding.  De Niro is rich enough.  He probably doesn't notice the price of gasoline.  He's successful enough to notice the unemployment rate.  And as a Hollywood actor, he may well be short-sighted enough.  He hasn't seen what the deficit's going to do to our children and our grandchildren.  But what De Niro said last night was inexcusable.  And the president should apologize for him.  It was at an Obama fundraiser.  It was exactly wrong.  It divides the country.  And if people on the left want to talk about radio talk show hosts, then everybody in the 
[01:17:00]  country ought to hold the president accountable when somebody at his event says something  is utterly, totally on their side.  Well, that's his gimmick.  Yeah, I understand why he's saying that.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, obviously, I honestly don't think Newt Gingrich gives a flying fuck that De Niro  said anything about the first lady and, you know, race.  But when they just stomp the shit out of Rush or anybody else that says anything that's  perceived as racist or something like that, you know, then you got to punch back.  It's a good joke because we heard for well over a year is, are we ready for a black president? 
[01:17:30]  Are we ready for a black first lady?  So it's kind of funny, man.  Yeah.  It was a funny little twist on that whole dumb thing that we heard ad nauseam.  Well, De Niro's known for his comic ability.  Well.  His comedic ability is amazing.  Oh, he's not?  Oh, literal Jimmy Norton.  You think he got a laugh or it fell flat?  I think I'd be a laugh.  It's just because he doesn't know how to deliver the line.  Well, Matthew.  Everybody knows Miss Santorum. 
[01:18:00]  This is Gingrich and the other lady there.  Hey, other lady there.  Is America ready for a white first lady?  Bobby De Niro.  But everyone knows that Grace Hightower is black.  Like, there's not an ounce of racism in De Niro.  You can say whatever you want about De Niro.  There's nothing racist about Robert De Niro.  He loves blacks.  Dude, I don't think he's fucked a white chick since fucking banged the drum slowly, if even then. 
[01:18:30]  So for him to do a racial joke and for anyone to, stop it.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean anything and you know it doesn't mean anything.  Let's listen to the rest of the new clip.  Hopefully it's him quitting.  It's almost all over.  And on that, I'm retiring and hanging myself because I'm fat and annoying.  Apologize for him.  The president's going to get right on that.  I have a personal preference, obviously, for Calista to be the first lady.  I'm happy.  But.  So do we with Obama. 
[01:19:00]  Wouldn't that be great if she fucking dumped him and said, I can't get enough black dick in my life and drop Gingrich?  I'm taking your advice, dear.  Yeah.  And fucking Obama started just banging Calista.  How great would that be?  Oh, I'm going to fuck the Republican right out of you.  Okay.  I'm very honored to have Ann Romney as the first lady.  Shut up.  And Torm is the first lady.  Shut up.  I think that's just what De Niro said was just beyond the pale.  Mention it again.  He should be ashamed of himself.  No, he shouldn't.  Exactly.  Not when a guy's joking, especially. 
[01:19:30]  He should be ashamed of himself for Rocky and Bullwinkle.  Yeah, exactly.  Not that.  Analyze that.  Yeesh.  Whatever.  And by the way, it's funny.  Somebody's Twittering me.  So no response on Fox News.  Fox News basically getting Louie thrown off the White House.  I was there for a panel discussion about what am I supposed to do?  Mention what Greta did on her blog, you fucking dumbbell?  Oh, my God.  People are so stupid.  Imagine if you just went, hey, by the way, like totally went off of what they want to 
[01:20:00]  talk about and just start ragging Greta about Louie and they'd be like, wow, what do you  mean?  What do you?  It wasn't that type of appearance.  You talked for less than a minute.  Holy shit.  And Louie left that.  And I think Louie felt weird doing that one anyway, to be honest with you.  Fucking shut up, stupid Twitterer.  People are dumb.  They just don't get what it is.  Oh, you stupid fuck.  You know what?  We should continue down this road here.  We got the old dirt road.  Remember? 
[01:20:30]  Well, speaking of which, yes, and Kirk Cameron explains his gay marriage comments to Fox News.  Oh, Sam.  So get on the gay porno.  I remember Piers Morgan, he tweeted that he would love for Kirk Cameron to come back on  his show to explain what he meant.  But Kirk Cameron decided to go to maybe friendlier territory.  I don't know.  He went on Fox News.  Yeah, he was saying some things about Piers.  Oh, I saw her on your dressing message.  Oh, oh, pom-pom power. 
[01:21:00]  Four to three-year-old Bengals cheerleader has spirit.  God, fucking take your dried up uterus and leave.  You shouldn't be shaking pom-poms.  Give me an N.  Give me an E.  Give me an O.  Give me a P.  Give me an A.  Give me a U.  Give me an S.  Give me an E.  What's it, Mel?  Hopefully menopause.  I did that quickly.  Hopefully, Mel.  Hopefully.  You did it well.  Give me an O.  Give me an S.  Give me a T.  Give me a Perosis.  You think the Bengals would love to fire her, but they don't want the lawsuits? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You know exactly what's going on there.  No NFL team wants a 43-year-old cheerleader.  No.  I'm sorry.  It's bad enough the stewardesses are old now.  Oh, they're fucking...  Continental United now has the fucking worst flight attendants.  They should all be getting out of a tub in The Shining.  It's fucking horrible.  American has some hot ones, though.  American Airlines on that overnight flight coming home has some fucking good smelling ones,  man.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  One bitch came over.  I was like, yo!  I've crinkled up my water.  Oh, shit.  They got the 43-year-old pom-poming. 
[01:22:00]  That's Fox News now.  How much did you want to see a truck jump the fucking curb?  Oh, that would be so fucking good.  Me, me, me.  They let her pom-pom for eight seconds.  They went to commercial.  Oh, would that be great?  Enough of this battle axe.  I feel bad for the Bengals fans now.  I feel bad.  Because, you know, they don't want her.  They don't want her on the sidelines.  Of course they don't.  No.  They would love to replace her with a young, hot piece of ass.  She's trying to do the...  Give me a C.  Give me...  We don't want to do the Coney Island chant again.  It's 1960. 
[01:22:30]  Jumps up and down.  And she prolapses her vagina.  Her fucking, her mesh fell out.  Her bladder mesh.  Give me an H.  Give me a Y.  Give me an S.  Give me a T.  All right.  Historectomy.  And then the one shielding goes, why don't they call it a herterectomy?  Because it's a lady.  They're doing like all bad fucking laughing lines. 
[01:23:00]  43 years old.  Oh, fucking go home already.  Exactly.  Although she was nice.  She was nice.  I didn't see her.  Did she look good?  She looked all right, yeah.  She seems nice enough.  That Liz chick was kind of cute though, right on Fox and Friends?  Yeah, something dirty about her.  And she made time with you?  No, I was kidding.  She wanted nothing to do with you.  Really?  She didn't even say hi to you?  No, no, she was friendly.  She asked my name and I said, Jim.  Jim.  But I didn't ask her.  Jim.  Good for you.  You didn't see the chip face, by the way, in the teaser?  I did it real quick.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love it in the face. 
[01:23:30]  I didn't have the courage to do it during the panel.  So Kirk Cameron goes on Fox News to explain his gay marriage comments.  Yeah.  Have you heard this yet?  I haven't.  Yeah, I heard a little excerpt.  Yeah.  I think he said something along the lines is, my career is over, so now I'm worried about  guys fucking each other and marriage bliss.  Shit.  Fuck Kirk Cameron.  You got into some controversy about some comments you made about gay marriage in particular,  say it's ultimately destructive to our society. 
[01:24:00]  Do you change your feeling about those comments or do you feel that that's the right thing?  No, I don't change my feeling about the comments.  What disappoints me, to be honest with you, is that when you're sitting across the table  from someone who knows what your perspective is on issues, and I've been very consistent,  I don't think anything I said surprised anybody as a Bible-believing Christian, but to then  take some answers, reduce an important and personal and sensitive issue to a four-second  soundbite and toss it into a community to start a political bonfire and really upset 
[01:24:30]  people that you're saying you're looking to protect, I think it's disingenuous, and  it was an interview that was supposed to be about this movie, not about gay marriage,  homosexuality, abortion, the presidency.  And that's where you took a perception, because no one was watching that show.  Did you pause real quick?  Oh, shut up.  God!  What bothers me is nobody, first of all, these guys all go to, maybe he doesn't personally,  but celebrities go to rallies and all that stuff.  Nobody just wants to hear about your movie, you fucking blithering it. 
[01:25:00]  It's not interesting.  They're a great crew.  We had a really good time.  It was a lot of fun.  The character taught me so much.  I learned so much from him.  I became that character.  Shut up.  He knows that, too.  He knows if you're going to go on CNN, they're going to ask you some fucking political views,  questions.  Yeah.  You know?  And then this guy, is that Kilmeade?  I think that's the guy you...  Might be, yeah.  Was it?  Oh, it sounded like Brian Kilmeade.  It did sound like him.  And then he's like, oh, no one watches that show anyway. 
[01:25:30]  Piers ain't going to let this slide.  That's what I like about Piers.  He doesn't let this shit slide.  And Piers didn't kill him afterwards.  Piers got a good soundbite, but he goes, I think he's brave to say what he said.  Piers didn't destroy him after that.  And Piers is an interviewer.  Like, I don't mind an interviewer fucking doing that.  Let's listen.  Nice porno you pulled up.  I'm disturbed because it looks like Joe Rogan's making out with another man.  Holy shit, that does look like Joe Rogan.  You pulled up a picture.  Two gay guys tongue kissing.  Watch that be Joe Rogan.  Oh, no. 
[01:26:00]  The one on the left definitely looks like Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  Joe, after, you know, he takes a few, you know, maybe a few liberties with the pot.  Maybe.  Liberties?  Yeah.  A few liberties.  He eats it like a horse with hay.  Rogan actually, his wife doesn't even cook for him.  She just sends him out to the barn and he eats fucking pot with a pile.  You think he smokes a lot of pot?  It's all he does is eat and smoke and fucking shit.  He shits pot.  I would eat his shit if I was still getting hot. 
[01:26:30]  Here's the end of the clip because I think there was a couple more seconds there.  This movie, not about gay marriage, homosexuality, abortion, the presidency, and contraception.  Because no one was watching that show anyway.  So.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  A little jab, a little jab.  That was dangerous.  Well, Kirk Cameron, I mean, look, his answer was right up to a certain point where he goes  that they reduce it to a soundbite.  And he's like, I'm a Bible Christian.  I guess he's right about that. 
[01:27:00]  Like, what do you expect him to say?  That's how he feels?  I think he's a twat, but he's got the, you shouldn't penalize the guy from feeling that way.  Yeah, of course.  Should have went back on peers and challenged peers.  Peers.  Go back on peers.  Go on peers.  But his opinion.  If you have a problem with peers, go back on peers.  But it's not an interesting, like if he's interviewed, right?  And he goes, that's my opinion.  It should, it should be, it should never cause any type of a stir unless he is saying, we  should do this.  And he's saying something harsh.  Then you can challenge that. 
[01:27:30]  But who cares what his opinion is?  Doesn't the soundbite stand on its own too?  Because sometimes they get a soundbite that it's like, whoa, that's completely out of context.  But was his soundbite complete?  I think it was.  I think so too.  It was totally what he thinks.  But why is anybody ever surprised when, like he says, a Bible-believing Christian comes  out against, like, gays?  I mean, it's so obvious and expected.  What was this big, oh, what did he say? 
[01:28:00]  It's what they've been saying for years.  It's because we're coming to that place where everything you say has to be completely  cleaned and sanitized and middle of the road and not at all anti-anything or aggressive  anything.  So when somebody says something like that, you almost can't believe you just heard  it.  Like, what?  Did he give an opinion that may cause somebody discomfort?  Yeah.  We're trying to avoid causing our own self-discomfort first.  We're in a weird place here.  We're fucking sickening.  I don't like this at all.  I love the fact that we can do this. 
[01:28:30]  And even though we fucking do serious, it's fun to be able to at least do it.  And thank God for fucking stand-up.  Fuck.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  You got it knocked as far as that's concerned.  I go right up there and make fun of every community.  But of course, all kidding.  All kidding aside, please.  I have love for everybody.  They'll come after satellite eventually.  They haven't gone after cable.  We got some room, though.  But they'll get to us eventually. 
[01:29:00]  I love looking at regular radio and seeing these poor bastards, what they can't do anymore.  I mean, they've been completely castrated, fired left and right for the littlest fucking nothing.  Did that guy get fired?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Which guy?  That was just dumb.  Oh, they threw his ass.  Monkeys?  Yeah, that's a rough one.  That's just dumb.  You got to kind of understand the world you're in.  We didn't understand the world we were in when we fucked up with the Sex for Sam.  We thought we were untouchable.  But certainly, you got to know you can't say that on the radio.  Yeah, that was... 
[01:29:30]  He should absolutely be able to, but...  It just slipped.  You should be able to say what the fuck you want.  He said something about these three monkeys or something.  It just slipped.  He didn't mean to say it and want to defend it.  I think it just came out.  It's like if you were fucking arguing with somebody who's fat and they know they're fat,  you're like, what the fuck are you fat?  Like, oh, fuck.  What was the actual clip?  Because now people were too vague with this, I think.  Who was it, too?  I forget his name.  I don't even know.  The radio guy.  Some radio dude.  What did he say, Sam? 
[01:30:00]  Sam.  Dan.  Dan Cilio?  Yeah.  W-D-A-E.  I have the audio if you want to hear it.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go.  Oh, E-Rock.  Yeah, of course he does.  He collects radio audio.  What a weirdo.  It's a creep.  The guy's name was Dan Cilio.  Yeah, interesting.  Out of Tampa.  Okay.  Sports radio?  Yeah.  Tampa.  Florida.  Hey, that's your home state.  If I hear that, when he was fucking driving on dates when he was a teenager.  Yeah.  The Dan Cilio show.  Born and raised.  Let's hear it.  Wow, you're going to spend all that money. 
[01:30:30]  Ugh.  And Dan will be like, well, they're not really that good.  No, no.  October already?  If they get those three monkeys, I'm good.  I'm ready, man.  I'm ready.  I want those guys.  These are great players.  The partner just shut the fuck up.  The partner didn't say a word after that.  There was nothing.  The partner could probably even hear it.  He's like, wow.  That's just dumb.  That was just a slip.  That's just dumb.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Because he's got that man cow persona and the man cow voice.  But he kept talking after and he said guys after like he was hoping nobody. 
[01:31:00]  Guys, guys.  You think?  Yes.  Then you stop the whole fucking show and go, look, I'm going to tell you right now.  That was a slip.  Well, you're probably hoping no one noticed.  Yeah, you're probably hoping.  Not calling attention to it.  You don't want to draw attention to it.  There is a mindset there in the seconds after you say something stupid where you're like,  maybe no one heard it.  He should have dumped it.  He should have dumped it.  Yeah, of course.  That's what he's thinking.  Oh, we should have hit the button.  Unless they don't have a delay.  Maybe not. 
[01:31:30]  Maybe not.  Maybe they don't have a fucking delay.  Maybe if they say fuck, they're fucked.  Not like us here.  We should break because Chris Jericho is going to be here.  Can he say that?  Is Kenny okay with us?  Kenny's telling us when to break now, Jimmy.  Why?  I don't know.  7 o'clock.  He knows more than us.  At 7 o'clock, he was like, you know, I should break because Jimmy's coming on at 7.15.  If you want to simulcast him.  And we're like, oh, wow.  We never would have thought of breaking at a certain time to logistically figure out Jimmy.  You know what?  But thank you, Kenny, for bringing that up. 
[01:32:00]  So we broke exactly when he said.  And we wound up coming back five minutes early.  Right.  And had nothing to get into.  I just wanted to bring it to your attention.  That's it.  Yes, that's exactly it.  That's it.  That's exactly what he said.  Does he understand how the breaks are structured, too?  Where we can break for 20 minutes or four minutes.  Doesn't matter.  We can drop shit on the fly.  We weren't going to miss Jim Norton on Fox & Friends.  No.  That's Kenny's version of I'm just saying, I just wanted to bring it to your attention.  Yeah, if somehow you popped on there while we were in the middle of commercials, we would have just stopped commercials and potted you up. 
[01:32:30]  But Kenny's like, perhaps you should break now.  Supposed to be on next Wednesday for a longer interview.  Oh, well, then I hope you bring up the Louis C.K. thing.  Cut the mustard.  My ex got so mad that I kept saying that in an argument.  You can't cut the mustard.  She's like, I want to fucking stab you.  I just kept saying cut the mustard.  Oh, God.  She probably had every right to.  Yeah, she's probably right.  That's as bad as saying you don't have the skill set.  You know that, right? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, skill set.  Use a little elbow grease every so often.  It's awful.  When you do the dishes, use some elbow grease.  Elbow grease.  Exactly.  All right, we're going to break his Chris Jericho.  Should we play the clip when he's here, probably?  Yeah, sure.  Chris Jericho has some beef with CM Punk.  If we do this properly, we're going to make all the wrestling blogs today.  I like a beef.  And all the wrestling websites.  Like we don't make them when they just sit here and talk anyway.  If we do this properly.  Those wrestling blogs.  Jesus Christ, do they love fucking...  I love getting a Google alert.  And I'm like, oh, what happened? 
[01:33:30]  Look at us.  Oh, Sam Roberts of the Open Anthony Show was talking to, insert wrestler here, about,  insert fucking some drama here.  Yeah, Sam, you have the whole world believing that we just do a wrestling show.  Yeah.  That's the only fucking Google alerts we get these days.  Well, I've changed that.  I don't want people to believe that.  That's why it now says Sam Roberts from after Open Anthony Live or from the Sam Roberts Show.  I love when it's a Google alert.  And the only way I'm in there is because Sam Roberts, the Sam Roberts Show, from, and then 
[01:34:00]  it says mentions Open Anthony Show.  On the Open Anthony Channel.  Yeah, yeah.  On the Open Anthony Channel.  And it's all about Sam and wrestling.  That's what happens, you know?  I don't control the prize.  No.  They publish what they publish.  They sure do, sir.  Yeah.  You're a fucking...  How would you do that?  ...the press sweetheart.  That's you.  Sam's a press darling.  Immediate darling.  Immediate darling.  All right, we're going to break Chris Jericho next. 
[01:34:30]  The Open Anthony Channel.  What's that?  On Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU Live.  Here's the latest batch of FU's.  Fuck you!  This FU goes out to the entire fucking show.  I can't get...  ...out of my fucking head.  Fuck you, show.  Fuck you!  Fuck you, Norman. 
[01:35:00]  Fuck you!  So, isn't this great?  That's all I can fucking say, you're awesome!  Fuck you!  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you, rober!  Fuck you!  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you, too. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, thanks a lot, Jimmy.  Fuck you.  Hey Anthony, how you who you are?  A whop, whop, whop.  Fuck you!  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Isn't this great?  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I just want to say fuck you to, uh... 
[01:36:00]  Oh, isn't this great?  That shit is stuck in my fucking head.  I can't...  I can't get rid of it.  Ah!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  3-Sexam.  3-Sexam.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So, is it this great? 
[01:36:30]  Welcome back.  Yeah.  This really does get stuck in your head.  What, what, what, what?  Audra Lindley.  So.  This is this great?  And Norman Fell.  Oh, my God.  Terrible dance.  The worst show opening ever.  Just her tennis. 
[01:37:00]  It's awful.  There's nothing to this opening.  It's horrible.  The dumb kid.  I want to use that for fucking, uh...  If I ever have a show, I want to use that as the guest theme opening.  Oh, that would be good.  Right.  Yes.  It's the opening that makes it, though.  It's just, it's like a fucking bat to the stomach.  People are probably watching this, like, whoever put this video up is going, why are there  hits on this video all of a sudden?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck? 
[01:37:30]  Where's, uh, Mule Juice McQueen, man?  Is he here yet?  What?  He just checked in.  All right.  Chris Jericho's going to be here in a few minutes.  Welcome aboard.  Rub your card.  And he's going to say some shit today.  Is he?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  He's going to get a good morning, I bet.  Good morning.  Happy Monday.  A full week.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  When did it?  What?  Day.  Yeah.  Halfway there.  Morning, morning, morning.  We might have a Mike Schmidt situation.  With?  Oh, no. 
[01:38:00]  Ah, Heinz Ward.  Played for the Steelers.  Heinz Ward.  He decided to retire because he didn't want to play for another team.  Most would say he definitely has some football left in him.  But he wanted his whole career to be with the Steelers, I guess.  Oh.  Didn't want to leave.  So he got a little emotional yesterday.  You want to hear this?  Oh, yes.  He doesn't.  All right.  These past few weeks, I spent a lot of time reading thousands of emails, Facebook posts,  tweets, letters, cards. 
[01:38:30]  We get it.  And well wishes from fans everywhere.  Smoke signals.  And as I read them, I was really moved by the tremendous outpouring of love, encouragement,  and support.  Through it all, I realized that there's only one thing that I love more than the game,  and that's Steeler Nation.  When I think about football, I think about Steeler Nation and the fans.  Steeler Nation.  Uh-oh. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, boy.  All right.  Without the support over the past 14 years, this game wouldn't mean the same to me.  Oh, boy.  Wouldn't be as fun for me.  Oh, no.  You guys meant the world to me.  Oh, boy. 
[01:39:30]  The city and this organization means the world to me.  So today, I'm officially retired as a Pittsburgh Steeler.  What?  So, is it right?  That's all well and good, but he's given up millions of dollars.  He could still play, but he's not leaving Pittsburgh.  Chris Jericho!  Hey, man. 
[01:40:00]  How nicely dressed you are.  How do you get dressed that nicely this early in the morning, man?  How do you do it, sir?  I know.  We're slobs.  I don't know how you do that.  We are slovenly in here.  You're a classy guy.  Really fast on this.  The club wouldn't.  They don't have loyalty to their players, so why are the players being loyal to the club?  I don't know.  The guy could turn around and do a couple more years and get a bunch of millions of dollars?  Are we talking about Heinz Ward?  Yeah.  That's my evil nemesis. 
[01:40:30]  Why?  Because he beat me on Dancing with the Stars, the son of a bitch.  Oh, shit.  That guy.  That was the same year?  That was the same year.  The year he won was the year I was on.  How good do you feel that the ratings are rolled down because they don't have Chris Jericho?  Yeah, and I love the fact that Heinz has to retire in shame.  Is he retiring in shame?  Did he get caught doing something, or is he actually just retiring?  He doesn't want to play for another team.  Yeah.  So is that shameful?  Can we talk bad about it?  Yes.  His retirement speech.  Shane, I knew it.  He's weeping openly.  His retirement speech is a little uncomfortable.  Yeah, uncomfortable to watch. 
[01:41:00]  He didn't win the whole thing, did he?  He did.  He won Dancing with the Stars.  Yes, he did.  See, we didn't watch it anymore.  See, we didn't watch clips of him right there.  Oh, there he is.  We didn't watch it.  Look at him tripping the light fantastic.  Wow.  Tripping the light fantastic.  Yes, there he goes.  Yeah, so, okay, so that's the big news that's going on.  But the new season, they got a shitty cast and the ratings are down.  No, it's Urkel.  Urkel's on it.  Yeah.  I hear Urkel's really good.  Ratings are down, man.  Well, you know what's funny?  After I did it, they're like, next year we're going all A-list celebrities.  But what they find out is nobody wants to do this thing. 
[01:41:30]  No.  Because it's hard.  It's like seven hours of work a day every day for like six, seven, eight, nine, ten weeks.  Fuck that.  Who the fuck's going to want to do that, right?  No one.  You think Tom Hanks is going to show up and do Dancing with the Stars?  I'll tell you, Melissa Gilbert, that's who they wound up getting.  That's an A-lister now.  You're right, you know, Chaz Bono was the big one last year.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, I mean, that's the second.  I'm available.  Would you do it?  You would be awesome at this.  I'd get booted the first week like Jeff Ross did, but of course I would do it.  Of course I would do it. 
[01:42:00]  But if you could last the second week, you really have something to stick down Ross's throat.  Yeah, that would make me happy.  But then again, you're a better dancer than Jeff Ross.  Like, does that really get you anywhere?  Something handsomer than Jeff Ross.  Who cares?  They brought him back, though.  Yes.  Yeah, they liked that he roasted everybody.  You smell good.  Jesus Christ.  Thanks.  Well, I just had a shower.  That's why.  Whatever it is, it's a very good cologne.  I haven't seen Jimmy's since the Zach Wilde roast.  Yes, we did that together.  Which was a blast, man.  It was a blast.  I heard you guys had fun.  We did.  Which, like, I never knew being a roast virgin is that when they call you to do the roast, 
[01:42:30]  you think, oh, this is great.  Yes, I will come and tell some jokes about Zach Wilde.  But what you forget about is everybody gets fucking roasted.  Yeah, yeah.  All the guys in the panel.  So it was just, like, a two-hour insult for all of us.  Sharon was the most brutal, too.  Like, when she's, I was, I've been to a lot of roasts.  I was actually, like, as she was smashing me, I was like, ugh.  I was crazy to move on.  What did she say about you?  I don't even remember.  I honestly don't remember.  I know she just, because they planted on Ozzy's Boneyard.  But I have, I've heard it.  So let's get the clips. 
[01:43:00]  I want to hear what she said about you.  He was great, man.  Jimmy was great.  Can we get those clips?  Yeah, sure.  He was, like, the miserable, like, you know, suicidal comedian up there.  And he's just, like, so angry at the world.  But that's why it was really well done.  That's good for a roast, I mean.  And she crushed Florentine horribly.  Like, she and she.  Oh, wow, really?  Is there, like, some heat between them or something?  She doesn't like Eddie Trunk, who's on the show with Jim.  But she liked Jim.  But then Jim blasted her when he came on.  And she was, I sat next to her at that moment.  I think she was, I just saw her.  She was laughing.  So she was fine with it.  She wanted it to be brutal.  Yeah, and the opening line. 
[01:43:30]  This is Florentine's opening line.  And this is serious, so I can say this.  He comes out there and goes, Sharon saved money on a Halloween costume last year because  she dressed up as a cunt.  That's a good one.  Hello!  That is a good line.  But she laughs, though.  Because she has a contract, like a network contract, where you can't, you know, she can't  be saying that kind of stuff because of her show.  They have, like, a PG clause.  Right, right, right.  But she didn't want to castrate everybody.  She's like, I want this to be harsh. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, right.  Take the gloves, take the fucking gloves off.  And that's why it wasn't shown on TV.  Exactly.  I want to hear these clips, Jimmy.  Let's bring some good clips on the way.  They should be on YouTube there.  By the way, they cut Heinz Ward, I guess.  Oh, yeah?  Officially, they cut him.  So what's the loyalty thing?  Yeah, fuck the loyalty at that point.  Maybe he just doesn't want to play anymore.  Scandalous.  It's scandalous.  The scandalous he got cut.  Here's what happened.  And here's a little Dancing with the Stars.  Ah.  Talking amongst the guys here.  A little inside scoop of Dancing with the Stars. 
[01:44:30]  So there's this one dance called the V...  I was almost going to say the Vietnamese Waltz, but that's not it.  It's the Viennese Waltz.  And it's a lot of turning and spinning.  You know, you're spinning around.  I'm not good at that 22 years of landing on my head for a living and headbanging and  all these things.  If I turn around once, I start feeling a little bit weird.  So I did the rehearsal that day.  And it was actually the one time I've ever done the Tonight Show.  I was so nauseous from this spinning.  Oh, shit.  And I was like, I'm fucked.  Like, how am I going to do this?  So I went to the store and I bought this thing called the C-Band. 
[01:45:00]  Get the C-Band.  It's a little band with a marble in it.  And you put it on your wrist.  And it, for some reason, like, makes the nausea go away.  You're supposed to use it when you fly.  Yeah.  If you're on, like, a cruise or something.  So I put it on.  And then, lo and behold, like, magic.  The nausea went away.  Oh.  I went and had the dance.  And it was great.  And the next Monday after the, or next Tuesday after I went and killed this fucking dance,  Heinz Ward is sitting in the corner.  And he looks all sick.  I go, what's wrong? 
[01:45:30]  He goes, I got the Viennese waltz this week, man.  I'm going to throw up.  I said, listen, take these C-Bands, put them on, and you will guaranteed be cured.  He put them on.  He got, like, three 10s that week.  Fucking crushed me in the standings.  Oh, shit.  When I won the thing.  All because I gave him the C-Bands.  You did it to yourself.  See?  I should have just kept it to myself and not said it worked.  Oh, man.  And I could have won Dancing with the Stars.  And I could, too, be retiring in disgrace today.  Oh, my God.  You should have recommended something like sushi that you had in your backpack.  Take these Valium before the show.  Warm mayonnaise. 
[01:46:00]  They worked, though.  Because I get motion sick.  I take Dramamine.  This really works for people.  I'll try this cheap-ass little stupid stretch band with a fucking plastic marble in it.  What is that about?  What does it do?  I guess it's just one of them ancient Chinese secret pressure point things.  My husband, some hot shot.  That's the second part of ancient Chinese secret that no one remembers.  I don't remember that.  You're not allowed to have commercials like that on TV anymore, though.  That's like time to make the donuts.  Yeah, that one. 
[01:46:30]  I was watching a fuckload of those last night.  Like, some guy posted something that said, old commercials.  I'm just, I put it, it's on YouTube, so I pop it on.  Remember things like Gleam toothpaste and fucking, there's just this ancient shit.  But I remember, like, every one of them.  And I'm sitting there going, yeah, I remember this word.  I was, eh, I'm singing along with them like a ringtone.  And then I was thinking, what movie was that where people were watching old commercials as entertainment?  And they were, uh, shit.  Sandra Bullock, Sylvester Stallone. 
[01:47:00]  Daylight, Cliffhanger.  No, it was, uh, it'll pop up right here.  Demolition Man.  Oscar.  Demolition Man.  Demolition Man.  Yeah, that was, uh, and they would watch old commercials and listen to old commercial jingles as entertainment.  Wasn't that, like, in the future or something?  Yeah, and it was supposed to be weird, like, why would anyone do that?  And then I realized, holy shit, like, I'm doing that.  Yeah.  Just watching it as entertainment.  The future has come true.  The future.  Stallone was right.  Yes, Stallone.  My husband.  Some hot shot.  Some hot shot. 
[01:47:30]  Ancient Chinese secret.  Seinfeld Falk.  Yeah.  Caught right.  Caught right.  Caught right.  We should mention WrestleMania 28.  Oh, yeah.  Ah.  That's why Chris Jericho's here a week from Sunday, right?  Yes, a week from Sunday.  Miami, I think.  It's in Miami at the, uh, Enormo Dome or whatever it's called.  The only one we went to was Anaheim.  Oh, did you go to that one?  10 years ago now.  That was a while ago.  That's when we were in good with the WWF at the time.  Oh, what happened?  Did you have a falling out?  I don't think so. 
[01:48:00]  XFL.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe the XFL thing.  I guess we haven't talked to Vince since then.  No.  He was counting on us.  What did he do to you guys?  What did he say?  We hosted the XFL pregame show.  The pregame show.  On NBC.  Oh, on NBC.  And, uh, hey, we did a great job.  I thought so.  Well, Anthony, when it didn't work out, though, what did he say to you?  You're fired.  I'm not saying that.  I had to set it up for you.  You're fired.  Oh, my God.  You're fired.  That was a while ago, wasn't it?  The XFL beer bet. 
[01:48:30]  And look at a young Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Look at the right.  It has been a rough 10 fucking years.  All right.  I was going on and doing a warm-up for this.  That's when I started coming on the show.  It was right before that.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Yep.  You've been coming for 10 years?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  You looked exactly the same back then, though.  I love him.  Wow, look at all the fucking people in the stands.  Is this a game?  Is this a real game?  Oh, yeah.  This is before a game.  This is an empty giant stadium.  Everybody's dressed up as chairs. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  We don't have to show Chris Charlie this.  Oh, my gosh.  This is the one where...  You guys are now going for the...  You're really like a girl, Anthony.  What's going on with you?  I had big, heavy boots on.  It was hard to ride.  And a pussy.  I shall know it'll be out of the way.  Yeah, yeah.  And a pussy.  I forgot about that.  And look at the box go off.  Yeah, but there's no one there.  Look at this.  He's running on the field during the play.  Yeah.  Nobody gave him shit.  Nobody was supposed to get the tee for the kickoff.  He's supposed to run out and get the kickoff tee. 
[01:49:30]  But somebody had gotten it.  So I look like an asshole.  So he just looked like an idiot running out on the field.  Look out.  But nobody cared.  There's no one cared.  There's no one there.  There's no cops.  Look at that.  No one's there.  Just run out on the field, do whatever you want.  I know.  Who's that guy?  That's Bob Golick.  That's Bob Golick.  Duh.  It says on the screen.  Yeah.  He was involved.  Bobby's still there?  What did Anthony ask him?  Can we hear that?  I don't know.  Come on.  What's the rule of report on?  I'm not turning this on.  I just want to hear Anthony's question.  No.  Come on. 
[01:50:00]  Can Anthony ask a quick question?  No, please.  I don't know.  God, you guys look like you're teenagers.  I know.  I don't know.  Well, we're children of the 80s, so you're not too far off.  We are.  We're children of the 80s.  You're happy to be on TV right there.  Oh, boy.  We were so happy to get our free Hitman jerseys and jackets and hats.  Steve Austin still wears those shirts.  Does he?  Whenever I see him, he's wearing like a Memphis Maniac shirt.  Steve, that was 10 years.  Free shirts, free shirt.  Free shirt.  Free fucking shirt.  What do I care about?  Yeah, guys.  If you made $20 zillion, you can buy a new shirt. 
[01:50:30]  We went from NBC loving us to hating us within two weeks.  They went from like all is good to not even talking to us.  Well, they canceled everything.  They canceled.  Oh, there's Vince.  Remember the-  They canceled the pregame show.  Remember the awkward elevator ride with the main guy?  I forgot his name now.  He didn't want to talk to us.  We were in his office before all this is going down, and then we're at-  Ebersole?  Dick Ebersole?  No, no.  We didn't go that high.  But this guy in the elevator, like, it was already known the whole thing was going away, 
[01:51:00]  so there was no reason to talk to us anymore.  We're at 30 Rock.  But we're in an elevator with the guy.  We're like, hey, how you doing?  He's like, hi, hi, hi.  He turns his head.  Like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  That doesn't bode well.  I get him to push the next button.  I'm off.  Where are you going?  Anywhere but here.  He was very surprised we were in the elevator.  Yeah.  Hi.  How you doing?  How many weeks did that last?  Six.  Oh, okay.  I think it was only six weeks.  I think we made six.  Six of them.  I think.  Yeah.  We got paid for all 23, though, or something.  What did they do before?  We made bank.  Who did they replace you with? 
[01:51:30]  No one.  And they just canceled everything.  The season was canceled.  Probably.  Cancelled.  It was great.  It was a.  I think.  Pay me, motherfucker.  I don't care.  We were replaced by a Miami Vice rerun, I think.  Something really shitty.  These were funny bits, though.  They weren't bad.  All right, Jimmy.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  They were.  Yeah, thanks.  Jimmy, you know what's funny is that I come in here, and yesterday, before I left the house,  I got a package from Amazon, and inside said package is a copy of Monster Rain DVD by Jim  and I, you know, we started here with the big blow up. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  Remember that?  And then we saw each other when we did Z-Rock, and then we were friends, and then we met up  again at the roast, and now we're like, we're text buddies.  Yeah, that's true.  Which pisses off Sam.  Sam brought it to our attention.  Oh, Sam.  Sam's still holding on to the past.  There really is.  Get over it, Sam.  Sam wishes that you would retweet some of his stuff, too.  No, but you're not funny.  That's the difference.  The problem is that CM Punk is also a fan of Norton's, and all the wrestlers like what 
[01:52:30]  Norton does, and none of them like what I do.  But what do you say with radio people?  You just kiss their ass.  Let me ask a question.  Do you do stand up or anything like that?  No, I do radio, though.  I know.  It's the only time I've ever seen you sitting in this chair on Opie and Anthony's, so  I mean, you never say anything.  They don't ask me anything.  Sometimes they ask me stuff when you're not around.  You've got to just throw it in there, man.  And these guys will never let you get a word in edgewise.  That's true.  You know?  Say something now.  Say something.  But you tweet too much about wrestling, and that's probably the turnoff.  Well, let's not ostracize them here. 
[01:53:00]  You're a wrestling fan.  That's very cool.  What do you think about WrestleMania?  Are you excited about it?  I'm very excited about it, and I was just telling them about what you've done.  So, isn't this great?  That's another Whisk commercial, by the way.  Yeah.  Instead of like you.  That's a Whisk.  That's 83.  That's a Whisk commercial.  Okay, so you just told them to bring your match into the forefront, into this main event  scene where, you know, for a year they've been promoting this Rock Cena match, but you've 
[01:53:30]  shown up and only been here since January, and you have gotten your match with CM Punk  on that level.  And how have I done that?  By telling the world that his father was an alcoholic.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  But the bottom line is making it personal.  Yes.  Yeah, it's not about like insults of like, you know, Rock will say that Cena has lady  parts and stuff, and that's funny.  That's fine.  But what I do is go deeper to something that there's like a little bit of a grain of truth,  and then people really get angry at me.  The first time I did that promo about CM Punk's dad being an alcoholic, when I left the arena 
[01:54:00]  in Cleveland, people were throwing rocks at my car.  His return, like, people were so excited that Chris Jericho was coming back.  Right.  And he did this thing when he came back to WWE, where he knew that he immediately had to get  the crowd to turn against him.  So he walked out, and everybody's cheering, and everybody's going ballistic, and he gets  in the ring, and he's getting everybody hyped up and everything, and then after five minutes 
[01:54:30]  of live TV, of just him smiling, going, yeah, and grabbing the mic, and then putting it back  down, and going, yeah, yeah, and then he leaves.  And he did it three weeks in a row, to the point where everybody was like, what is he doing?  That's hilarious.  That's why we love Jericho.  Oh, what an asshole.  Everybody got frustrated to the point that they forgot that they were happy he was back,  and he was right back to being the most evil person on television.  What I love about Jericho is, so many times, you're not sure what is a work. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, well, I mean.  I love that about you.  Like, there's personal stuff with CM Punk.  Yeah, well, what I figured out over the last, maybe, three or four years, especially the  last time I was back, was that, I mean, you're obviously playing a character, you know,  and it's kind of like Seinfeld.  Jerry Seinfeld was on the show Seinfeld playing Jerry Seinfeld, but they're two completely  separate guys.  I mean, there might be a few elements of the same.  Same with me.  On WWE, I am a complete dick asshole.  I do whatever it takes for people to hate me. 
[01:55:30]  I commit.  I don't care if people throw rocks at me.  But when I'm not on that show, I'm not that character, but some people have a real problem  figuring out the difference, even to this day.  I mean, everybody knows that wrestling is entertainment, but it's still, people go, well,  you know, I met Jericho, and boy, I thought he was going to be a real jerk.  And it's like, you know, Anthony Hopkins doesn't really walk down the street in a straitjacket  trying to eat people's livers with a fine Chianti.  He's just playing that part in Silence of the Lambs and that John.  The hardest part is, like you said, Seinfeld being Seinfeld. 
[01:56:00]  Right.  When you're using your own name and it's supposed to be you, then people say, oh, it's him.  That's absolutely how he feels.  Well, exactly.  And that's even why, you know, like I have the band, my band Fozzy, we've been doing stuff  for 12 years.  We actually, when we first started, just as a fun thing, we came on your show.  Oh, yeah.  Now it's been, we remember that.  I thought it was playing the part, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we tried for what?  That was hilarious.  I think we tried for an hour.  Yeah, yeah.  And you wouldn't.  And then, like, two years later, we thought, listen, we want to just do our own original  stuff and have fun with it.  And now, like, over the last couple of years, I've kept it completely separate. 
[01:56:30]  There will never be Fozzy on the WWE because I can't bring this band onto the show because  people will hate it instantly just because they hate me so much.  They hate you, right.  And, you know, like, we're playing Download this year with Sabbath, the only show that  Iommi's doing on the day that Metallica's playing.  Wow.  We're doing that.  Yeah, we're doing that.  It's overseas or here?  It's in Donington in England.  Wow.  Damn.  That's pretty fucking cool.  We just signed a major label deal with Century Media.  We've got so much cool stuff going on that people go, why don't you bring Fozzy?  I can't.  It has to stay in its own other completely separate world. 
[01:57:00]  Its own entity.  Yeah, because we're doing really good there.  I can't take the chance that people...  Yeah, I can bring my grandma on there and people will call her a crack whore at this  point.  How many people are going to be at that show?  That's a massive one, right?  70,000.  70,000.  You're going to play in front of 70,000 people.  Yeah, we did last year, too, at Sonosphere over there.  We do really good over in England.  How does that feel?  It's amazing, man.  Because when I was a kid, probably the same as you, I wanted to be in a rock band and I  wanted to be a wrestler.  Those are the two things I wanted to do.  The only person that actually did that was Hulk Hogan.  Well...  Some of those great songs. 
[01:57:30]  Come on, man.  It's you and Hulk Hogan.  Hulk Hogan in heaven.  Hulk Hogan in heaven.  You're the same guy now.  According to Hulk, he almost got...  Lars called him to play bass in Metallica.  Oh, shit.  That's a true story that Hogan is told.  Look that up on Google.  Of course it's not true.  Okay.  Can you imagine?  Oh, man.  Whiplash, brother.  But he claimed that.  But, yeah, so, you know, it's cool to be able to say, okay, I'm going to be working in  front of 70,000 in Miami at WrestleMania in one of the big matches, and then, you know,  three or four months later, going to Donington to play the biggest show of the summer 
[01:58:00]  over there.  Damn, yeah.  See, Hulk Hogan reveals the almost joined Metallica.  Almost joined Metallica.  The wrestler also speaks about his love for the Stone Roses, which is the reason why  he's not in Metallica.  Hey, when is your...  When is that Donington date?  Donington is June 9th.  Can we go?  Yeah, come.  On your dime, I mean.  It's Metallica playing...  On your dime.  Metallica playing the Black Elm in its entirety.  Wow, man.  And then on the next night, it's Sabbath, the only appearance that Tony Iommi is going  to do. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, it's not the same night.  Okay, sorry.  It's a weekend.  And actually, Friday, which is so crazy, the headliner is Prodigy.  Remember Prodigy?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Still huge in England, where they're going to draw 70,000 for that.  But there's also like 1,000 bands.  It's one of those ones like everybody's on it.  Prodigy never went away.  They never went away.  Isn't it weird about some of those bands?  They're gone in America, but they've never gone away.  They're still playing in front of huge crowds.  We've heard that about what?  Aha, was it?  Yeah.  Like in Norway or something.  And here's another one.  Third from the top. 
[01:59:00]  It's Metallica.  There's an English band called Biffy Clyro that we have never heard of that's huge over  there.  Third from the top, Tenacious D.  Oh, my God.  People love them over there.  They're massive.  That's fucked up.  They're playing in front of 70,000 people two slots away from Metallica.  Wow.  Like what?  Who's playing right before Sabbath?  I think that's Soundgarden that night.  Oh, wow, man.  And the three headliners that night is Sabbath, Soundgarden, and Megadeth.  Damn it.  That's a good show.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  If you look at the poster, like go download. 
[01:59:30]  Don't you want to go to that show?  Why don't you go?  I might.  Everybody's mad as an ocean in the wake.  What are you going to do?  I don't care.  I've never gone overseas for a show, but I only might be playing one show in the States  too.  Yeah.  He's playing one stage show.  You should go.  Donington is.  Yeah.  If you look up, let's check it out.  Who's playing drums on that, Chris?  Do you know?  Is it Ward or they don't know yet?  I think.  It's still up in the air.  It's still up in the air.  Or if Ward doesn't do it, I heard Tommy Klufitos is going to do it.  Okay.  Which is, that's fine, but it's, I want to see Sabbath with Sabbath.  I prefer it.  You know what I mean?  Like how much longer do they have? 
[02:00:00]  Like let's do it right.  You know what I mean?  So.  Look at you, man.  Lamb of God.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  It's just like, you know.  Wow.  Look, Saxon playing.  Saxon.  Saxon can even do the main stage.  We're on the second stage.  That's still amazing you're in that fucking, you're doing a gig with Sabbath then.  That's crazy.  Yeah, it's cool.  And we're actually on the day that Metallica plays.  Very cool.  And there's four stages, so we've got second stage.  It's pretty good.  Even second stage, you'll be doing about 50,000 people.  Good for you, man.  Yeah, man.  I want to play the clip where you call out CM Punk because you're on here to promote 
[02:00:30]  the WrestleMania.  Sure.  This is what a lot of people are talking about today.  Because I did a little research this week, Punk, and I found out something, a little deep,  dirty, dark secret about you.  Oh, boy.  You've been straight edge ever since you came to the WWE.  You've never explained the reasons why.  I want to tell all of these wannabes why you're a straight edge.  I want to tell them that you're straight edge because your father is an alcoholic.  You paused that? 
[02:01:00]  Jesus Christ.  I don't know if you're going to answer this, but did he know you were going to say that  at that point?  Yeah.  I mean, he actually has done stuff like this in the early years on the independence and  stuff.  But I guess his dad was an alcoholic because he's straight edge.  That's his gimmick.  Which means no drinking, no smoking.  And so that's the reason why he's straight edge.  For real.  So I always try and find something in a storyline that's personal because people can feel it.  Something that's different from normal.  I'm going to hit you over the head with a chair or whatever it is. 
[02:01:30]  And you can hear the people react.  It's like, oh, come on, Jericho.  That's a low blow.  And in a lot of ways it is.  But that's what I do.  You have a little dick, don't you?  But he knew you were going to go there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knew.  But it's still pretty, pretty deep.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  You've only got to just neighborhood interviews before the match.  Fucking reviewing neighbors.  Didn't he have any homosexual encounters when he was young? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, that's right.  Your father was an alcoholic who let you down every step of the way when you were growing up.  And it terrifies you.  You don't want to end up like him.  But it's inevitable that you will.  Because alcohol is in your blood, punk.  Holy shit.  It's in your genes.  It's part of who you are.  And that tortures you.  I know you've built this facade, this wall that you're a sarcastic anti-hero with not a care in the world.  But I think I've found something that you care about. 
[02:02:30]  I've found something that gives you nightmares.  Something that terrifies you.  Let's see if I'm not thinking about it.  The very alcohol that you drink is the same thing that ruined your childhood.  The nightmares you must have about your father.  I almost feel bad for you, punk.  Is that the reason why you have all those tattoos?  Was the pain of wanting to drink so bad that you needed the pain of a tattoo needle to take it out of your mind?  Was it your only solace?  It doesn't matter if it is, punk. 
[02:03:00]  Because you are going to drink eventually.  And I'm the one who's going to make you drink.  I'm going to take away your title.  I'm going to take away your claims of being the best in the world.  I'm going to take away your bravado.  And I'm going to leave you a broken man.  You're going to hit bottom, punk.  And when you do, you're going to embrace your destiny.  And you're going to take a drink.  And it's going to taste so good that you're going to want to take another one. 
[02:03:30]  And another one.  And another one.  After April 1st, I'm going to be recognized for who I am.  The undisputed best in the world.  And the new WWE champion.  And you're going to be recognized for who you are.  Who your father was.  A pathetic, damn drunk.  That's too much for that.  Hey, boo.  Now he's got a line. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, now.  This reminds me of, was it Mystery Science Theater?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You talk over it.  What's going on there?  What's going on there?  No problem.  Is this just right?  You're a psycho, man.  Well, I mean, you've got to get into character, right?  I love it.  You know, and that's why it's like in that arena, everybody believes that I am the biggest  asshole in the world because I become that.  And that's, you know, that adds a lot of intrigue to what we're doing.  And a lot of people want to see that match, which is cool. 
[02:04:30]  Don't you bring something up about his sister, too?  Yeah, that was this week.  That was the follow-up.  That was the follow-up promo.  Is this promo done or is there a little more to it?  No, that's the end of it.  That's pretty much it.  Chris, I like what you're doing.  Call his mother a whore.  All right, Vince, whatever you want.  Well, the follow-up promo, he calls CM Punk's sister, right?  Yeah.  Crackhead.  Yeah, drug addict.  Drug addict.  Yeah, I said, I'll never say anything about your father again, I promise.  But your sister has another story.  You just sold me.  I'm watching WrestleMania.  I haven't watched it in a few years. 
[02:05:00]  I'm watching.  I haven't been in years.  I went to a Sergeant Slaughter match when I was a kid.  Years?  How about decades?  Wow.  My dad took me.  I forget who he was wrestling.  But it's really cool, though.  I mean, even just the other day on Sunday, we had a show at the Garden.  And, you know, anytime you go to the Garden, it's great.  This time, it was a sold-out show.  I always take the time to go to the back.  And if you've ever been in the back, there's pictures of everybody who's played there.  Not everybody, but, you know, George Harrison from 71.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  McCartney, and, you know, everybody's up there.  And then they've just added Van Halen from a couple weeks ago. 
[02:05:30]  So they have it from, you know, the 70s all the way up to now.  And just to see, like, you know, Tyson knocking out Frazier and just, like, it's just so cool  to know that you're in this arena where all these great moments have happened and to be  able to see them on the wall.  It's cool to be a part of that.  Tyson, do you mean Ali Frazier?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I meant Ali Frazier.  I was too scared.  I was too scared.  No, because Mike Tyson beat on Marvin Frazier.  I just said, yeah, that's what happened if he tells us.  Yeah, Tyson fought Ali, don't you know?  Don't make me tell what I know about your father, Opie.  Did you go Sunday? 
[02:06:00]  No, I was in Anaheim on Sunday.  I went to SmackDown last night, but I wasn't in town.  Where was SmackDown?  Newark.  Oh, okay.  I wish I'd have known it was here.  I would have gone Sunday.  I saw some of your pictures.  I should have told you.  I forgot.  It was great.  I would have gone to the house show on Sunday, but I was out of town.  Okay.  You said that right.  Don't get mad about it.  Wrestling last night, though.  You said it was great.  Real fan would have gone.  Yeah.  What happened when we asked Jericho about WrestleMania?  I mean, I don't know.  We're good, right?  Yeah.  We did pretty good.  They did very good.  We did very well.  They're actually paying attention and keeping an eye on what's going on.  Yeah.  Opie has some notes over there he's been reading off of. 
[02:06:30]  That's good.  That's right.  I don't have notes.  Like a real interview.  But you know what you're doing.  I know basic shit.  Yeah, no, that's good.  I know basic shit about this stuff.  A lot of guys, you know, not you guys.  Someone called out The Rock on our show saying that he's not as good off script.  Well, let's see.  What do you think about that, Sam?  Who said that to us?  Oh, Sam.  CM Punk said it to him.  No, John Cena said it to him in the ring about his notes.  Yeah.  He wrote them on his hand.  Who brought that up to us?  Yeah, Edge was in here.  That's right.  And he said the whole thing was that.  He pointed us toward that saying, look, man. 
[02:07:00]  It's the first time in a long time, maybe ever, that The Rock looked flustered after John  Cena pointed out that he had promo written on his wrist.  Yeah.  And that's something you don't do.  It'd be like, you know, you're doing stand-up with your notes on your wrist.  You just don't do it.  Like, I've never even considered it.  If I don't know what I'm going to say, I'll just wing it.  But to have the notes written down, I almost thought it was a gimmick.  Like, I thought it was a work, as we say.  Like, he did it on purpose so that John would say it.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't believe it.  Like, it was real, though.  And you don't know?  No, it was real. 
[02:07:30]  He just, he, hey.  Oh, it was real.  Did he write them in ink on his skin?  Yes.  Yeah, he had pen on his skin.  Pull your sleeve up, write some shit down, and that's what he was kind of looking at.  How did he read that in that moment?  Like, I could never focus enough to actually read that in front of a room full of people.  How do you make sense?  It would just be like, blah, I'd be afraid that I'd be like, and then, I'm just staring at my wrist.  What am I right there?  My penmanship is awful.  But it was also a moment that needed to happen because The Rock had been making John Cena look like an idiot for a year.  And for the first time, Cena looked strong. 
[02:08:00]  And that's what you kind of need going into that match.  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  It was definitely intriguing to see that, for sure.  There's two really good matches.  What else?  Well, and Triple H and The Undertaker are going to be in the Hell in a Cell.  With Shawn Michaels as a referee.  That'll be a good one.  Can The Undertaker still move?  He hasn't wrestled since last year at WrestleMania.  That's what I'm saying.  But I think he's healed up now.  He's been at it a long time.  Because what we have is he has a streak.  He's won 19 WrestleMania, so he's 19-0.  And this year, he's going for his 20th win at WrestleMania. 
[02:08:30]  So every year at WrestleMania.  Which means he's not going to get it because Vince is a prick.  Vince is not going to allow that nice 20 number.  No, you want to talk about a real-life Fonz, that's The Undertaker.  He calls the shots.  Whatever he wants to happen is what's going to happen.  Is he the oldest wrestler right now?  Yeah, I think so.  And definitely the one that everybody respects him.  Seniority.  Yeah, he's The Fonz, man.  Oh, wow.  He's one of those guys that is kind of top of the full chain.  Yeah, exactly.  Everybody will listen to what he says.  Even if he said something to Rock, Rock would listen. 
[02:09:00]  Really?  Or Steve Austin or anybody like that.  Really?  He's like the top of the top.  Wow.  And he's the coolest guy in the world, so he really is The Fonz.  You know, if you need advice on how to pick up the chick, you know, you're like,  I need a date for the prom.  What do I do, Taker?  Come over here.  Let me tell you.  We get Mick Foley in here every once in a while, Chris.  Uh-huh.  And we love pointing out how cheap he is.  Oh, totally.  We're getting the great stories out of him where he sleeps at fans' houses and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  To save money on a dumb hotel.  What he used to do was if, and we were talking about this the other day, as a matter of fact,  is if, like, you know, he had, like, maybe a 6 o'clock flight or something like that, 
[02:09:30]  and sometimes you don't get out of the arena until 12, 1230, he would just go to the lobby  of a hotel and just say, do you mind if I just sit on your couch for a couple hours?  Like, okay, and he would just sit there.  Everyone else would grab a room to take a-  Yeah, for three hours or something.  He's like, no, it's not worth the 50, 60 bucks.  I'm just going to sit on this couch.  It's hilarious.  That's an OCD thing.  Like, guys who do that, because I knew a guy like that, who are that, like, crazily cheap,  that's got something to do with hoarding money or hoarding the concept of money.  Because that's, you know, you don't want to spend $30 on eggs. 
[02:10:00]  I get that.  But to fucking not give yourself a room for three hours.  You're a professional wrestler.  You're an athlete.  Yeah, that's a problem.  Was it Edge that told the story that a whole bunch of these guys were in the same hotel room  one night?  They got stuck?  And was Jericho in there?  Yeah, yeah.  We got stuck.  I think he mentioned you.  Well, that's what happens, too.  Like, people don't understand.  It's like, when we go on the road, we're in charge of all our own stuff.  I mean, they give you a plane ticket, and that's it.  But when you get to the town, yeah, you've got to rent your own car.  You've got to get your own hotel room.  And sometimes, like, now with Hotwire, free plug, it's easy because you can just put it 
[02:10:30]  in there.  You can figure out your whole itinerary for the weekend, and it's cheap.  But before that, you would just drive around.  It's like, you know, okay, we're in Columbia, South Carolina.  I'll just get a room.  Well, the problem is there's a tile convention in Columbia, South Carolina, and there's no rooms  available for 40 miles, and you sleep in your car.  I slept in my car in the parking lot of the Columbia, South Carolina airport, and I was  the world heavyweight champion.  Wow.  And I put my little alarm on the dash.  I brushed my teeth with the water bottle.  Holy shit.  Wow, that's fucked up.  So the one time, we were in Detroit, and there was a blizzard, and everybody got stuck. 
[02:11:00]  So all the hotel rooms were booked, and we found one hotel room, and there was two groups  of guys, one group of three, one group of two.  And it's like, well, where are you going to stay?  We have nowhere.  We have a room.  So it was five guys in a room with one king bed.  And this was like only five, six years ago.  So you split the bed.  There's a box spring, and there's a mattress.  Two guys on each bed, and then like a guy sleeping on the floor.  So yeah, we're sleeping in a bed with another grown man.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[02:11:30]  People don't know.  Yeah.  Why is it set up that way?  Why does Vince set it up that way?  It's always been that way.  That's a pain in the ass for you guys.  It's very much a pain in the ass, and we're independent contractors is what it's called,  and that's just the way it's always been.  We're the same.  Because we came from the carnival days when wrestling was like at a circus.  Right.  And as modern as it is in some ways, it still has that old school circus mentality where  you kind of just got to fend for yourself.  And when you get into business, you come up that way, so no one will ever change it.  There'll never be like a big union or – because Vince will just shut it down. 
[02:12:00]  If you want to be in a union, then you're fired.  You're fired.  We'll find some other hack to come in there and do your job.  So you've got to figure out your own, man.  Plane tickets and hotel rooms.  Plane tickets are taken care of.  Oh, you said that.  Yeah.  So hotel rooms and cars, you know, all that sort of stuff.  Even on that level that you're on, like, you know –  Yeah.  I mean, I can get them to book rooms for me, but they'll book, you know, like, here you  got the Wall of Restorium.  It's $500 a night.  We're all just going hot wire and get something now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd rather do it myself.  Well, the reason it's a pain in the ass, you guys do over 100 dates a year. 
[02:12:30]  More than that, dude.  We do four days a week.  That's conservative.  Four days a week.  So 200 dates a year?  Yeah.  And you're booking all that stuff on your own?  Basically, yeah.  And also have to worry about, you know, doing well in the ring and all that.  Well, that's – yeah, exactly.  It's not just the travel.  Then you've got to show up and actually deliver.  Right, yeah.  It's an entertainment entity like none other.  I mean, that's why I love going with the band because we all get on the bus.  My tour manager tells me what time to get up, tells me what we're going to do.  I show up, you know, you do your show, you get back on the bus, you have some drinks,  you watch some movies, you go to bed, you're driving to the next town. 
[02:13:00]  There's no airport security.  There's no bullshit.  It's way better to do it that way.  And a lot of you guys just drive from town to town to save money too, right?  Yeah, I drive from town to town all the time.  You like it?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm used to it, man.  I've been doing this for so long.  Some guys like Sina and Punk have their own tour buses that they go from down to town.  You don't have a bus?  No, I don't.  It's only 100 miles or 150 miles, you know?  And if I'm going to be in the tour bus, I'd rather be with the band.  I don't want to be sitting on a big tour bus by myself.  Wouldn't that be cool to have your own tour bus where you have the whole back?  I'd be like being like them little kids in like the toy with Richard Pryor where the 
[02:13:30]  kid is sitting at the giant table.  It's super long by himself at the end.  Look at this giant table by myself.  What a loser I am.  Can't even get anybody to go on my fucking tour bus.  Marco has to go.  How long have you had that tattoo, Chris?  I got this in June.  Oh, you did?  All right.  I never saw that before.  Yeah, I had it when we did the thing.  What does it say?  It's the F from Fozzy.  Oh, nice.  The guys in the band all got them when we got our...  Did you ever think that Fozzy would last us long?  We started off as just a fun thing and then we actually had such good chemistry and we 
[02:14:00]  had some fun and some good songwriters in the band.  So I always wanted it to happen and now that it actually has been over the last couple  of years, it's really gratifying because like I said, I've been in a band since I was  12 years old, man and I know way more about music and it's like, you know, me and Jimmy  have our own radio shows on XM as a matter of fact and it's not just because we're like  just fanboys.  It's because we actually know what we're talking about and that's just from years of living  with it.  It's become part of who we are, you know?  But Fozzy's got to be at least 12 years old.  12 years.  Yeah, man.  We met you at N.E.W. and that's a while ago now. 
[02:14:30]  That was in 2000.  That was a while ago.  That was my first time on the show.  To date with Chris was in?  Yes.  And that's also, I believe, Frantic Fran was in that day.  Yeah, I remember Frantic Fran.  Dice Clay was there.  Dice, yeah.  And Andrew brought me in.  Yeah, that was...  I was touring with him.  I didn't know Chris Jarek was there.  That was, yeah, my first time on.  We loved Frantic Fran.  Yeah.  I forgot all about her.  We have any people on her?  Where is Frantic Fran?  Is she still around?  Can you find that for after the break?  Call in if she can.  We'll see what I got.  I think, yeah. 
[02:15:00]  But that was 2000.  Yeah, it was exactly what it was.  October of 2000 was when it was.  I didn't know who the band was or anything.  And they were like, just break character.  They just kept trying to get you to break character.  Yeah, yeah.  I was so frustrated.  I was doing like an Andy Kaufman, Tony Clifton thing.  That's exactly what my inspiration was for it.  I was like, I'm just going to keep doing this and I don't give a shit.  And it was cool for about two or three months.  And I was like, what are we doing?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Yeah.  If we actually want to do this, we better become ourselves.  We should get in one more question.  Do you have any Virgil stories?  Oh, shit.  Virgil?  That's actually a good question. 
[02:15:30]  Virgil will always, you can't see this at home, but he'll always like hit you.  I'm like, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.  And I'm like, I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Look, look, look, look.  I'll come in the ring.  Look, look.  I'll give you a big arm drag.  Look, look, look, look.  Then I'll give you a big body slam.  Look, look.  And it's like, I'm looking at you.  And there's no such thing as a big arm drag.  It's like the most basic maneuvers.  But Virgil actually, what he does is if there's like autograph signing conventions.  Yeah, no, that's why we're asking.  We know.  We're all about it.  If you get invited to do a convention, you show up. 
[02:16:00]  He just brings his own table, like a picnic table, sets it up in the corner, and just  starts signing autographs.  Yeah, yeah.  But the problem is he's not signing autographs because we got a whole montage of pictures  of Wimson by himself in front of him.  And I laugh with DiBiase's son all the time.  He has this sign that says, The Million Dollar Man, Ted DiBiase, and Virgil.  Yeah.  But DiBiase's not there.  No.  And had no intention of being there.  We laugh at this constantly.  I like that one.  Sucks to be Virgil, right?  There's Virgil.  Look, look, look, look. 
[02:16:30]  I'm signing autographs.  Look, look, look.  There's no one ever in front of him.  I'm fucking looking right at you.  Stop hitting me.  You get big lines at these things, right?  Yeah, I don't do a lot of them, but the times I have done it, yeah, people always want to  come and hang out, so it's cool.  Get pocket money.  Yeah, it's always good, too.  For me, too, I'm such a dick.  Even when I'm in the arena or outside, when I was at the garden, actually, the other day,  you have to park in the structure beside the garden, and as I was walking to the elevator,  there was a guy and his little kid son.  And when I'm on the grounds of the arena, I do not sign autographs for fans. 
[02:17:00]  I don't talk to fans.  I don't take pictures of fans.  Fans are beyond scum.  Oh, wow.  And this kid was standing there.  He's like, can you take a picture with my son?  And I'm like, just not even looking.  He's like, please look at my son.  I have a son, too.  And I just was breaking my heart.  Oh, shit.  I can't sign an autograph when two hours later, I want these people to boo me.  I can't do it.  Right.  If I saw him, I'm like, now, no problem.  So when I get to do these signings, it's fun, because then I can actually get a chance  to say hi and meet the people, because most of the time, they just...  That's awesome.  Get some dad punch you in the face. 
[02:17:30]  You didn't sign for my son.  Yeah.  You motherfucker.  There's no Chris Jericho merchandise, either.  I won't let them make it.  Anyone punch you?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want them.  Why?  Because I don't want anybody to wear a Chris Jericho shirt, because that's one less guy  that's going to boo me when I'm in the arena.  And yes, I have been in a fight with a fan.  There's probably even online.  In Victoria, BC, last year, or a couple years ago, I got attacked by two drunken fans,  and there was no security.  So there was a big brouhaha.  And then Nancy Grace saw it, and I was public enemy number one.  Until they got charged, and I was innocent, but there was no retraction.  Doesn't she suck?  Why would she not know her facts? 
[02:18:00]  What nickname did she give you?  Did she give you a horrible...  The wrestler.  Do you need some...  What's the backstory on this before we play it?  Okay, pause it for a second.  Backstory is we're in Victoria, BC.  I pull out of the parking lot, and there's no security.  It's just a parking lot with a thousand people gathered around.  And as soon as we pull off the lot, we're fair game.  There's a red light right by the parking lot.  I stopped at the red light, and some guy comes over and kicks in the side of my car.  Oh.  And this was right after about a year, or not even years after, but you knew Dime. 
[02:18:30]  I knew Dime.  No, I never actually met Dime.  Okay, well, you know how cool he was.  When something like that goes down, some guy kicks in the car, like, I don't know what's next.  So I got out of the car and said, you know, get the fuck away from me.  And I figured once I get out, tell the guy to leave, security will come, and they'll take him away.  There was no security.  And when I got out of the car, suddenly it was like a zombie movie.  I'm surrounded by zombies, and I'm cut off from my car.  Oh, shit.  So now this is what kind of goes on.  It's like, all right.  Human, Canadian, everybody, keep going. 
[02:19:00]  Monday night, here.  You see that?  Push you, man.  Yeah, they're putting their hands on you.  And this girl's boyfriend was punching me.  She was trying to punch me in the balls, so I'm trying to get her away from me.  I get in my car, she follows me.  And see what happened there was when I went and pushed her away, that's the one where Nancy Grace thought that I punched her.  You are definitely fighting off a crowd here.  It's the Walking Dead.  That's fucking crazy. 
[02:19:30]  I'm like fucking Rick, the sheriff.  See him, and this guy's coming at me.  I push him away.  I take him down.  The security isn't doing anything.  No.  And the people keep advancing.  And I'm trying to get back into my car, and I'm pushing everybody away.  Pushing everyone out of the way, yeah.  You know?  And then I drive away, and some guy jumped on the hood of my car like a Clint Eastwood movie.  Holy shit.  What dummies?  Yeah.  I'm like, fuck Nancy Grace.  She stinks.  Enough already.  And so when I came across and pushed the girl away from my car, it looks like I'm wanting  to hit her, but it gets cut off by the thing.  So that's what she saw, and that's where... 
[02:20:00]  Now, did she ever correct herself?  She should have punched her.  No, she never did.  Why would she?  Because what happened was the cops charged them, and I wasn't charged, but there was  no retraction.  Roland's panicking.  He's got to go.  Roland's freaking out.  Where's he going?  He's going over to Fox.  Uptown.  I've got a good morning, New York, whatever it is.  It's always a pleasure, man.  It's great seeing you guys, man.  Thank you for always having me.  It's always a blast.  Yeah.  Fuck you, man.  WrestleMania, a week from Sunday in Miami.  April 1st.  Jericho versus Punk.  And it's IamJericho on Twitter.  He's a good one to follow, boys and girls.  Thanks, guys. 
[02:20:30]  See you soon, man.  Thanks, man.  The O.P.  The Anthony Channel on SiriusXM.  And now, Jimspirations.  Inspiration is better than being outside of spiration.

The following sexually explicit CB radio transmission took place one evening in early 2010 between radio personalities Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia.  Neither party has been made aware of its existence until now.  I'm thinking about you.  Yeah.  Did you get the video I sent?  Yeah.  I really do want to be rough with you.  Wow.  Well, what do you want to do?  What are you going to do to wear me out? 
[02:22:00]  I want to treat you rough.  Throw you around.  Spank and slap you.  Slap your face.  Yeah.  Treat you like a dirty little whore.  Put my cock in your ass and then shove it down your throat.  I want you to bite me.  Now you're talking.  Then I'm going to tell you to shut the fuck up while I slap your face and pull your hair for making noise.  Wow.  I want you to beg for my cock.  Yeah.  Kiss you all over to convince me to let you have it in your mouth. 
[02:22:30]  We will see how bad you want me.  Whatever else turns you on.  Whatever I want, you are mine.  You please me like no other has or ever will.  I'm not losing that.  Great thing is we have a lifetime of this.  Okay.  Lights out.  Good night, sexy.  Coming to Soundlight Radio and your news.  Chipper Radio.  Chipper Radio.  C-H-I-P-P-E dash radio. 
[02:23:00]  Chipper Radio.  The big joke is going to be, what did you knock your radio over and chipped it?  You chipped your radio.  Chipper Radio.  Chipper Radio.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  There's no way they would know.  God, is that a great idea.  We might do the first hour of the show again.  They might if they.  What?  You mean do it live?  No.  Yeah, why don't you just say the same things again?  It's too late now. 
[02:23:30]  Or just play it.  They would hear, good morning.  We had a really good first hour.  Everything that's happened in the world.  And if we replay that now, we could go home early.  Oh.  You've had a really good first three hours.  Let's make it a tour.  That's true.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  Brown noses.  Yeah.  Brown noses to you.  Hey, the situation, is he in rehab or is he not?  Because people are trying to figure it out.  He says he's not in rehab.  He tweeted that you shouldn't believe everything you read. 
[02:24:00]  I hear he needs a little rest.  Huh?  I hear he needs a little rest.  Yeah.  He was very overworked.  And he wants to get his body in top-notch shape for season six.  Oh, the sitchigans.  Is that it?  Where are you, Jimmy?  I'm right here.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I call him sitchigans.  Why?  The sitch.  That Jersey Shore is done.  You got Snooki pregnant and you got the situation probably in rehab, but he can't say he's in  rehab because that fucks up the whole vibe of what Jersey Shore is all about.  So he's going to say, no, I'm just resting.  Yeah.  He can't get sober. 
[02:24:30]  No.  No, of course not.  No one wants to see a sober situation.  Although they might like it if it's something different because then there's something to  push against.  Like, they've run the gamut with the other shit.  Right.  So her being knocked up and him having this, there are normal progressions in life that  might make it more interesting.  Season two or three, this would have been a disaster.  But by season six, you've seen every fucking thing they could do.  My feeling on this is that they weren't even going to do a season six.  And then when Snooki turned around and said she's pregnant, they're like,  Oh, fuck.  We got to take advantage of that. 
[02:25:00]  You're a little snookster.  They just have her do her show.  But she's saying that she's not going to be pregnant in that house.  So she's going to kind of like come and go, I guess.  She's going to be like on the phone, like Chrissy and his company.  Just on the phone.  Snooki's cousin will show up.  Yeah.  Cookie.  Cookie.  That sounds horrible.  Yeah.  I think Jersey Shore should recast and keep some of these guys to kind of bridge the gap.  Why did she keep?  Well, just the situation.  Even Paulie Snooki in general.  Here's why they can't. 
[02:25:30]  It would end up like the real world where they would try to cast regular people and start  getting actors that want to show up.  Like the real world is not the real world anymore.  That's why Jersey Shore worked because they went back to that formula where they really  just got a bunch of goofballs.  Got a bunch of javroos.  Yeah.  Or else they'd be looking for the next situation.  Javroos.  Well, wouldn't it be, what's his name?  The Unit.  The Unit.  I talked to him in here.  He's Dolores.  You talked to The Unit?  I saw when he signed in.  I'm like, Jesus, dude.  Relax.  He's the situation's friend.  He walks around like a rock star. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He appeared on the Jersey Shore for maybe a total of five minutes.  And he's like, yeah.  And his name's The Unit.  Show these guys The Unit.  The Unit?  It's The Situation's friend.  He probably has a big dick.  That's what he says he does.  That's why the big unit, Randy Johnson, that's what his nickname is from.  He's a big cock.  And he is a big cock.  He certainly is a fucking cunt.  He's big.  Here's The Unit.  Let's see The Unit.  God.  God damn it.  The Unit's in shape, too, though.  Jesus Christ.  With GTL, that's part of it.  There's The Unit.  He has an 8-pack.  One, two, three, four.  He has an 8-pack. 
[02:26:30]  He's got one of those OPVs, too.  Yeah.  Not as nice as OPVs.  Like, his body isn't as defined.  No.  God help us all.  You know who has a body like that, which is a really depressing guy?  I think his name is Ryan Bader.  He's a fucking heavyweight or light heavyweight MMA guy who weighs, like, 200 pounds.  And he's like, I'm like, God, to be that big and in that kind of shape is frightening.  That's a whole thing.  That's part genetics.  You can't eat anything.  It's diet.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't eat anything.  You just got to work out for hours.  You know how much fat everyone has between that layer of skin and those abs that, like,  look, a little bit and it's fucked. 
[02:27:00]  Someone has to say, you got to be part gay to have abs like that.  Well, yeah, that helps, too.  I'm being dead serious.  Sam, is that true?  Sam?  You got to be part gay to fucking do that.  I have fairly well-defined abs.  I don't know how that's true.  Wait, it was part gay?  I don't know.  Maybe you could...  How are you part gay?  I don't know.  You only like guys sucking your dick, but you won't suck their dicks.  Yeah, there you go.  Jimmy just did fine.  You only like to eat a guy's ass, but you say no fucking my butt.  That's part gay.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That seems exhausting to try to keep your body looking like that.  Yeah, it is good, though.  I don't know how you do it. 
[02:27:30]  You do a good job.  Yeah.  Look at that, the way that shirt clings to you.  Holy fuck.  I mean you, Opie.  No, you don't.  The shirt's gripping.  You can't see it, but the shirt is actually gripping as...  I can count the fucking abs through the shirt.  I'm sexy and I know it.  Yeah.  I'm sexy and I know it.  How many hours do you think he spends in the gym?  I'm sexy and I know it.  Knowing him, I would say an hour.  If I didn't know him, I would say at least 16.  Yeah.  16 hours a day is what it looks like.  Yeah.  How does the shirt cling and show the abs through the shirt? 
[02:28:00]  I do a few hours a week, so hopefully my fucking baloney tits don't look like B-cups  anymore.  Holy shit.  All right.  That's where I'm at at this stage of my life.  He's sexy and...  That is modest, he says.  That's the answer that I repeated.  Oh, really?  He's sexy and we know it.  That's right.  Girl, look at everybody.  Sexy and I know it.  He works out.  I'll say he does.  Sexy and I know it.  He's sexy.  I'll say he does.  Noodles says it all. 
[02:28:30]  Fuck abs.  I like hamburgers.  Bravo, sir.  Oh.  All right.  I've never had an ab in my life.  Look up Ryan Bader.  Because for a small guy to do it is one thing, but for an athlete of that size to do it is  fucking mind-boggling that a guy can be that big and be in that kind of shape.  I'll say it is.  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  What are we looking at?  Here's Ryan Bader, who's a really big dude in that kind of shape, which I find him even 
[02:29:00]  more impressive.  Yeah.  What are you doing, E-Roc?  Cut off the wiggle-wiggle part.  Wow, I wanted to wiggle-wiggle-wiggle.  Wiggle-wiggle-wiggle.  So what do you think?  Jersey Shore done with the Snooki and the situation?  I don't know, man.  Ratings were horrible this year.  Were they?  Comparatively speaking, yes.  That's comparative, though.  They weren't bad compared to the rest of MTV, I don't think.  People are just probably moving on.  Still strong ratings, but just not as good as they used to be?  Yeah.  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah.  It's got its audience.  There's an audience that won't leave it. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  And those guys, they were not flashing the pants like they had a few-year run.  Those guys were all, like, situation is probably set for life.  He's getting $50,000.  They were talking about him on Fox this morning.  $50,000 a club appearance.  So let's say it goes down a few years.  He's still making 10 Gs to show up.  That's fucking amazing money, man.  Crazy money.  That adds up fast, huh?  Man.  You think he's doing one a week?  Oh, yeah.  I don't think these guys are dumb either.  I think they all have people around them.  Again, it's not like it was, say, even 20 years ago.  They're all investing their money. 
[02:30:00]  You hope that they are.  Because it's like you guys just made money just from hanging out.  Even Dina's smart?  Well, I don't know about that.  Dina's a dummy.  I had to explain to Jess the other day.  She was like, why would they put a new person on the show?  And I said, that's Dina.  She falls down.  Yeah.  And you just watch the show.  And literally, we were watching a marathon.  And we saw her fall down 13 times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where Chip Adi comes from, because he wanted to be on Jersey Shore.  He did.  Oh, yeah.  Chip, for some reason, thought that my ex-girlfriend had cancer. 
[02:30:30]  And he's like, I just want to be on Jersey Shore before you die.  She reminded me of that recently.  I forgot about that.  That's where Chipper D came from.  Why do you think she had cancer?  I don't know.  He's just an idiot.  He's just an idiot.  Yeah.  She had cancer.  And he wanted to go on Jersey Shore to impress her.  I could just be Chipper D.  Yeah.  Meet all the people.  What's up, yo?  He didn't even have a creative name.  He just took Pauly D's name.  What's Chipper?  I would love to be on Jersey Shore, but I would be like the fucking, the older guy.  Who kind of straightens everybody out and stops all the club stuff.  You'd be the fuddy-duddy is what you'd be. 
[02:31:00]  I'd be like the fucking, I'd probably be like, I bet you the young people would really like.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Come on, guys.  Keep it down, please.  I'm trying to write.  The voice of reason.  Passing around in my book.  I'd like to see Jim, like, going to the clubs and everybody's dancing and drunk.  And Jim's the one creepy sober guy who's still trying to fuck the girls.  Yeah.  He's still trying to get the girls to come home into the smush room.  And that would be the fucking, the headline, Jersey Shore star, in quotes, loses erection.  Fat stomach. 
[02:31:30]  It's not right.  Well, they are going to do a sixth season, so.  Yeah.  Good luck.  We'll have all the guys in here, I'm sure.  Good luck to you.  We've met just about all of them now, right?  Except Ronnie.  Ronnie's the holdout?  And I just found out next month I'm doing a wrestling show that Angelina is going to be on.  Who's Angelina?  She was in season two.  The holdout that left Jersey Shore.  What a dummy.  She left after season two.  What an idiot.  And now she's going to be in role.  She didn't see that that whole thing was going to be profitable?  What a dummy.  Because she wasn't getting along with anybody. 
[02:32:00]  So she never came back on?  No.  Dina took her place.  She left after season two?  I think.  Yeah.  I don't know if she made it through the whole season two.  Just jump in.  No, I was waiting for you.  This season they ran into her.  Please, you're not to talk about it.  What?  Go ahead, you're not to talk about it.  What happened to her?  Did she actually leave after season two?  Right before season two ended.  Okay.  But they ran into her a club during this season.  They couldn't get away from her.  Stop talking fast so I don't cut you off.  You heard that?  But they ran into her a club. 
[02:32:30]  Poor E-Rock.  Why does anyone give a shit about Jersey Shore?  That phone call is coming in.  That's a good point.  It's entertaining.  I watch.  Well.  Yeah, it's like.  I don't think as many people are entertained anymore.  People fall down.  People get all fucked up.  People do stupid shit.  We're trying to act young.  That's why.  I've seen it.  That's your answer.  We're trying to act young and hip on this radio show.  With Jersey Shore.  And I'm trying to infuse youth.  Oh, yeah.  That's why I'm on the show.  Youth infusion. 
[02:33:00]  How's that working?  Youth infusion?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got to talk younger.  Aren't you 30?  Shut up.  Are you 30 already?  No, I'm 28.  That went fast.  I'm 28 already?  I'm a child of the 90s.  Hey, man.  You got any rap songs I can jam out to?  Oh, that's a good one.  You got any rap songs I can jam?  Tenacious D.  Those guys are hilarious.  Ironic.  I just miss being a child of the 90s.  The 90s, yeah.  By one year.  You're a child of the mid-70s.  No, I'm not. 
[02:33:30]  Me and I are children of the 80s.  I'm telling you.  Dude, when I was watching that thing, that video on YouTube about all those products,  I remembered every fucking one of them vividly.  The first time you saw pubic hair, Nixon was resigning.  There was another one called, a toothpaste called McLean.  McLean.  And then there was a detergent.  This guy comes out and he goes, many of the clothes you wear these days are made of synthetics.  Yes.  Polyester.  And he names a bunch of synthetics. 
[02:34:00]  He goes, these are not meant to be washed in hot water.  So you need a detergent that's meant for cooler water.  Cold power.  Cold power.  Cold power.  Cold power.  I'm going to find this video.  Fucking cold power.  And Gleam, you're right.  Is AIM still a rubber?  AIM?  AIM toothpaste is another one.  What's AIM?  And then the other one, I'm polishing my teeth.  Polishing my teeth with pearl drops, tooth polish.  Dude, all this was just.  I don't want to ruin the gimmick.  I won't read what the year is that this commercial was on. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, well, this one's from 1971.  Anthony Heard has been jumped in his car.  Go to the video.  Anthony, what video was it?  It's actually called commercials from, I think it was 65 to 75.  Oh, just like that.  Just like this.  It was.  Jimmy just smashed Sam's banana. 
[02:35:00]  And, God, there were so many of them.  Probably be hard to single out any one.  But there's a bunch of those that are.  And they showed, like, the channel lineup for ABC.  This fall on ABC.  Mannix.  MASH.  And they're showing little clips from it.  And doing the ABC.  We're come home to ABC.  It was like all those dumb song in advance. 
[02:35:30]  She's squeezing the tomatoes.  Yeah, this is Don't Squeeze the Charm.  Turn this up a little bit.  Because these are very nostalgic.  But, Mr. Whipple, this new Charm in bathroom tissues is solved.  How about I squeeze it after you use it?  And I wring the piss out into my face.  What would be really great is if he grabbed it by the collars and said,  I just said, you cunt.  Don't squeeze the Charmin.  Mr. Whipple loses his shit.  Yeah, Mr. Whipple is fired for fucking punching the actress in the jaw. 
[02:36:00]  Smashes her skull in with a tomato paste can.  Yeah.  They come over it.  And Mr. Whipple is sodomizing her bloody body.  Her fucking head is leaking fucking red fluid.  He's ass fucking her with some canola oil he found.  Yeah, and he's dipping the fucking blood in it with Charmin.  Yeah, he's blotting it up.  And he just looks up with his hair mat and goes,  It's the quicker picker upper!  That's the wrong product, Mr. Whipple. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, Mrs. Logan.  Huh?  Charmin is so deep down pleasably soft, it's irresistible.  Oh, my God.  But, Mrs. Logan, the sign.  These were commercials.  I don't know if you only knew, Mrs. Logan.  I can't resist it myself.  I look to sneak a squeeze on the slide.  This is very sexual.  Of course it is.  Yay, look at the picture.  Mr. Whipple, please don't squeeze the Charmin. 
[02:37:00]  He's jerking off.  She comes, Mr. Whipple.  Yeah.  And then he says to her,  I was just pretending those were your juicy middle-aged lady tits.  I was thinking of squeezing them.  And then he starts pinching the Charmin and twisting it.  Stonguing it.  He's putting his dick between the Charmin.  He just don't fuck the Charmin.  As funny as that is, that's exactly what they want.  Yeah, that's what they were going for.  Yeah, of course.  They love that, what is it, the subliminal sex shit.  Yes.  Back then.  Mr. Whipple, please don't squeeze the Charmin. 
[02:37:30]  Because whenever I wipe my asshole with it, my finger pops through the paper, dagnabbit.  What's the next one here?  Take it home and squeeze it.  Squeeze it.  Squeeze it.  I love the announcers on that.  Creepy crawlers, creepy crawlers, creepy crawlers.  One of these.  Creepy crawlers are so much fun.  We are.  And everyone.  Yay.  Oh, that cat's dead now.  Showed a little cat.  So it's the kid problem.  Ah, Sam.  Good job, Sam.  Yeah, you'd put the plastic goop in. 
[02:38:00]  And the mold.  And put it in a hot fucking oven.  Yeah, we forget that.  We used to have to make our own toys.  Yeah, what the fuck was that about?  And they're showing the good versions.  They don't show it.  Because you know that it fucking bubbled over on the mold.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone's creepy crawlers.  Probably look like the elephant man.  I'm sure we've done this break, but then you run out of the goop and you start using whatever the fuck you could find.  Melting your army men.  Or crayons or whatever.  Crayons, whatever.  You would try everything.  You'd be a found used condoms around the house.  The best was the fucking reaction of the adults.  Ah, it's a creepy crawler. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, they're all scared.  Yeah.  A kid would think you could scare your parents with it, so you'd want it for Christmas.  And you'd hang it in his face.  Yeah.  Scary.  You can tell they're in the tail.  They're creepy crawlers.  Yeah, he was jumping up and down.  Creepy crawlers.  He spilled the soup.  Surprise me, Joe.  Oh, this thing.  Your poor wife.  How does she do it?  Maybe what it is.  Fuck you, cunt.  It's Rosie, right?  You work at a diner, Rosie.  It's the quick picker-upper.  No.  She says the quick picker-upper. 
[02:39:00]  She didn't say quicker picker-upper, right?  Right.  It's quick picker-upper.  Yeah.  But didn't it later on it became the quicker picker-upper?  Because then he pulls out his cock and he goes, oh, that's the quick picker-upper.  It's really big.  And she fucking holds it with bounty and the cock breaks the bounty.  His cock broke dry bounty towels.  That's how he would meet girls?  That was the test?  Yeah.  He would hang his half-hard heavy cock and just drop it on a bounty towel and it would fucking  rip it right and shred.  It would shred the bounty.  And believe me, you spill something on a diner counter, they're using that stink rag. 
[02:39:30]  Of course.  That fucking old stink rag.  Like, she's got the bounty soaking up her last period.  Oh, she probably had that last period a while ago.  Yeah, she did.  She's dead, too.  Yeah, she's dead.  She wasn't a good-looking broad, huh?  What a slob.  Rosie.  Not good.  She's judging people that spill things.  She's behind a diner counter at fucking 50.  How does your wife do it?  Do what?  She does it.  She does it the way I say, where she gets the fist.  That's right.  That's what you should have told her. 
[02:40:00]  I throw acid in her face like a Pakistani girl.  That fucking horrible country.  I saw a documentary last night on Pakistani women who have acid thrown in their faces by their husbands.  Yeah.  And guys who want to marry them.  Is that like a big thing to do?  It's fucking, there's like 100 cases a year, but that's a lot.  Wow, wow.  Yeah, it certainly is.  And they finally passed a law where it's life in prison if you do that.  Wow.  How did that start?  These fucking, these disgusting fucking men.  I guess they can't handle, if they think their wife brings them dishonor or she wants to divorce them.  They throw battery acid in their faces and it scars, the documentary was about a guy, a Pakistani doctor who lives in England and he goes back to Pakistan to help these women. 
[02:40:30]  And the one, her husband I think did it while she, outside a court, this fucking, you look at this guy and you just want to cut his throat.  And this poor woman, like half her face is completely, she looks like half a face in Batman except it's just scar tissue.  Whoa.  And her eye, it looks like she's wearing putty over the eye.  It's like completely smoothly sealed over.  Whoa.  And her lip is all puffy like, meh, see?  Meh, meh, got acid in my face. 
[02:41:00]  And by the end of it, she looks a little bit better, but it's so damaged that they can't even put a glass eye in her.  It's fucking horrible.  It's terrible.  Bunch of great guys over there.  That culture, I mean, I know it's not the whole country doing it.  Nah, don't, don't even say that because it probably isn't.  But just, just the fucking fact that that's acceptable, but, and then you see one of the guys who set his wife on fire.  The wife was saying that the husband threw acid in her face and that the guy's mother or sister poured gas on her and the mother set her on fire. 
[02:41:30]  And then the whole lady's whole neck is burned and they show this piece of garbage husband saying, she got mad and dumped it on herself and bumped into a candle.  Come on.  And then he says, uh, 99% of the women who go for this have thrown acid in their own faces.  And then this woman had to move back in with her husband and make up with the family because she didn't have enough money.  Holy fuck.  It's like a half hour documentary on HBO on demand.  That's gotta be an awkward Thanksgiving.  Oh, dude, I know.  Fucking her neck is terrible.  It's called saving face. 
[02:42:00]  That's crazy talk.  Horrible.  Man.  And she's still fucking him.  Wow.  It's a horrible, horrible fucking situation.  All right.  Sorry.  Oh, that was, uh, what's her name?  Rosie.  Rosie.  Rosie.  Yeah, I was watching these last night.  It's like, oh man, I remember, I remember all these so vividly.  Yeah, I remember these well.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I hit it.  Let's see what, uh, what's next.  In they go.  Oh, she's gonna demonstrate.  The body absorbs more liquid faster.  Strong, too.  Rosie, the mission's a love bomb.  Sure, it's a quick picker-upper. 
[02:42:30]  You're right, they're quick.  Oh, hi, guy.  Who are you?  Oh, how you doing, guy?  He opens it.  Pause this.  He's talking about it.  He's, one guy's opening up his medicine cabinet, and there's another guy.  Opening his medicine cabinet on the other side of the wall, like at another apartment.  And he's saying hi to him.  Yeah, he sees him jerking off.  He always goes back to jerking off.  The guy's taking a big shit.  I just stink.  Comes right through.  Hi, guy.  Isn't that where Pat from Unaki got that?  Yeah.  The new modern apartment. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, I think you got silver right, guys.  What's that guy's name?  He's, like, he looks familiar.  He was around for, uh, character actor.  Yeah, character actor for quite some time.  I think he was in everything.  That's Jerry Shepardini, the guy in the other room.  No.  Jerry Shepardini.  No, he's not.  He is.  No, he's not.  G-E-R-I.  He spelled it like the girl from Facts of Life.  Blair's cousin.  Jerry's got too big.  Jerry Shepardini.  I remember this one.  I forgot what it's for, though.  Wait a minute.  I remember it, but I forgot it. 
[02:43:30]  American Tourist.  Oh, American Tourist.  The luggage.  Every suitcase is the unexpected.  Oh, boy.  There's a monkey running down the steps.  Oh, boy.  Banging.  And he's wearing a hat.  Oh, jeez.  He's jumping on the luggage.  Oh.  Kicking it down the steps.  Oh, my God.  Big gorilla.  To us, an American Tourist, it's not just how good it looks, it's how long it looks.  It's one of those suitcases without...  Oh, it's got wheels.  Oh, this one does have wheels. 
[02:44:00]  It's that dumb wheels, though, that, like, rolled it where it would tip over all the time.  They didn't know to put the wheels on the side.  They took way too long to fucking invent the wheels.  Figure the wheel of the luggage out.  And you have to pull it like you're walking a pet.  Yeah.  They have ones now, though, which I kind of want to get.  Like, mine is wheeled, obviously, but the ones where they stand straight up and you can  wheel them like that.  I don't have those.  I don't have those.  Those are nice.  Oh, now you just sound like a crazy person.  Do you know what it is?  A lot of times I want to just wheel the whole thing in a row.  I just want to go wheeling and dealing and get my stuff with my hats on the airplane. 
[02:44:30]  Back when I would take a Pan-American over to Europe, we never had the wheels.  Well, I flew one time.  I was getting on Eastern Airlines and I was going down to Florida to have my vagina resculptured.  I did that, too, but the fare was cheaper on Piedmont.  Piedmont.  Piedmont.  I was just thinking of Piedmont.  Flying that shit.  Piedmont.  I'm flying Braniff Airlines.  Braniff, yes.  I did fly Braniff when I was fucking, I was dating this girl Tina back when I was, like, 22. 
[02:45:00]  And me, her, and her dad went to Disney World.  And her dad, this is how different flying was.  He flew Continental down.  I flew the airline and I wanted to come back with her.  Like, I went down by myself.  I was so scared.  Aw.  So he gave me his Continental ticket and he took my ticket.  I just switched to them.  Wow.  And just swive.  You could just switch like that.  Yeah, back in, how great was that?  88, maybe nine.  Yeah, that was the good old days.  Good luck now, right?  Switching.  That ain't happening now.  Don't switch a row or something.  That ain't happening.  Eastern Airlines, the wings of man. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  What was that one?  PSA was another airline.  PSA.  Continental Airlines used to say, we'll really move our tails for you.  Was that their slogan?  I think that was it.  What does that mean?  I know.  Well, they kind of sexed it up like that.  Of course they did.  It was always about the sexy stews and what they would do.  We were on those asses.  That was part of the selling point of the airline was their sexy stews.  You're right.  And now it's just fucking... 
[02:46:00]  Let's see the next commercial.  Hey, right.  Oh, what's this one?  You got the look.  You got the look.  Jordache.  You got the look.  I want to know better.  I hate you.  You got the look.  What is this?  Child porn?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yay.  Yay.  You like their Jordaches, Uncle Paul?  Sure do.  Yeah.  Oh.  Everybody's doing the Watusi.  I bet you can't name these people.  You know their names?  Sure I do.  Yeah?  Yeah, that was Timothy and Amber. 
[02:46:30]  She would always jump up.  I'd say, you got the look.  And she'd go, I want to know better.  And I'd say, you got the look.  And she'd say something.  And I'd put her face in the pillow.  Yeah, we'd all dance Jordache.  And I'd slide them down.  Yeah?  You like those tight little Jordache?  Sure.  I'd say, let me smell that word.  Oh, God.  You'd smell where it said Jordache on their butt? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, I could always tell when she'd been running around.  Because her little feet would smell.  And sometimes Jordache in that little middle seam keeps the smell of the privates in.  Oh, my God.  Scrub-a-dub-dub.  Somebody's becoming a woman.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck, Uncle Paul.  So?  Is this great?  Wow.  Sure.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard Uncle Paul say. 
[02:47:30]  What are you talking about?  The jeans.  The seam holds the smell.  Sure it does.  They're so young, their bodies are confused.  The body don't know what it's doing.  I'll show them what's confused with you.  Yeah, the jeans will just keep that in there.  I would always take it off and say, time to test and see if you're healthy.  Healthy?  Yeah.  You smell that seam there.  I bet you was jogging around the playground.  You fall off the jungle, Jim?  I smell a little copper. 
[02:48:00]  I'm sure once that happens, they don't get much of Uncle Paul's attention anymore.  Yeah, you got to just know when to kick them out the nest.  Come on out of here.  Go over there.  Yeah.  Old lady.  That's brutal.  I like Rick Santorum.  You do?  Sure.  Why?  He looks like a lot of my friends. 
[02:48:30]  Where's the sweaters?  And he's got the Anson Williams hair, though.  A lot of the same interests as you?  He looks like guys that do.  I would file trade with a guy that looked like Rick Santorum.  He would always go, I don't like the gays.  I'd go, me neither.  But it don't count when they're really young and you're just trying to teach them.  Yeah.  We would teach them how to kiss.  Oh, fuck.  It's so hard.  He looked like Rick Santorum. 
[02:49:00]  Santorum.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He was always talking.  How would you teach them to kiss?  You got to sit them down.  You put them on your lap.  You go, now, here's what you do with the lady.  And you take the shirt off and you rub the back a little.  And then you just plant one on the neck.  And you whisper something.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  Open your mouth.  Do your whiskers leave a little rash when you're done?  If you kiss too hard, sometimes I'd get crazy.  And we would lay on the beach like I was Montgomery Cliff. 
[02:49:30]  I'd pretend there was seaweed on us.  From over there to eternity or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Here to eternity.  Yeah, whatever it's called.  Yeah, whatever that is.  I'd go, I'm pretending I'm Montgomery Clift.  And I'd kiss real hard.  And they'd go, oh, you whiskers.  I'd go, why are you talking?  And they'd say, you're kissing my butt.  I would say, oh, wow, Chipko.  I would say that would be a dead giveaway, though, like leaving a rash like that. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, you would say the right thing.  A lot of parents said that, too.  What happened to his face, Mr. Hargis?  He fell.  Oh, is that what you'd say?  He skinned it on the rug.  You're either a really good actor or you had some shit happen to you when you were growing up.  I'm telling you.  You just teach him how to kiss.  Yeah.  And you got to keep telling him, close your eyes.  You look frightened.  Yeah.  You don't like the frightened look?  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:50:30]  You got to make him close the eyes.  People like that better in the pictures.  Yeah.  Paul, you got to ask him.  They look frightened.  Holy shit.  It's so disturbing.  It really is.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Damn kids messing up the pictures.  True.  Just really good acting, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Well, let me smell your jeans.  Hey, come here.  Take them tough skins off.  Tough skins?  Sure.  Should we go to the next commercial? 
[02:51:00]  Well, maybe it'll inspire Uncle Paul.  Okay.  Holy shit.  Or maybe Edgar.  Edgar was a big hit yesterday.  I fucking, I actually, I took a camera picture on my Twitter and I sent it to my ex who has  the flu and she was fucking miserable that Edgar was popular.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She should be.  I was so happy.  Next commercial, Sam.  Oh, please.  Stop.  Stupid.  There's a Frisbee disc for different reasons.  For individual, team, and disc golf competitions. 
[02:51:30]  There's a Frisbee disc for different seasons.  For windy flights.  And a glowing disc for warm summer nights.  There's a Frisbee disc for a new friend and an old friend.  And there's a great new thing.  A Frisbee band flying ring.  The whole season of reason.  Take your Frisbee disc or ring.  Frisbee sucks.  I know.  They weren't trying to do, they were all trying to do cool moves back then.  Let me catch it behind my back.  Look, I'm going to spin and then wing it underhanded and fucking, ah, Frisbee, shut up.  You didn't like Frisbee.  I did at the time. 
[02:52:00]  I liked it.  Now in retrospect, it seems stupid.  What was it called?  Ultimate or something?  Ultimate Frisbee, man.  We're going to play like football.  Play Frisbee football.  Frisbee golf.  Frisbee golf, Jerry.  They play it in the park.  We used to, we used to Frisbee golf.  Yeah.  In the schoolyard.  Yeesh.  Just would hit the trees.  We didn't have baskets.  That's an old hippie thing to do.  Yeah.  I play Fris-D in Fris-Z, not Fris-B.  Ah, that's a good one.  Fucking A. 
[02:52:30]  That's funny.  Should we go to the next commercial?  Yeah.  Yeah, just, let's fucking go through some of these.  Hey, what's Ali doing?  Who's in Muhammad Ali, isn't he?  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck is, who is that?  I don't know.  Mr. Titchener, I'm concerned about my effort.  Instead of a nice young man, all she's interested in is one of your cars.  Hard to believe, Mama.  It's the Jew.  One 98 cubes.  Who's that?  Three-foot-like four-inch bore.  Four main bearings.  Oh, but she likes this Dodge.  Mr. Titchener, may I give it my own little test now?  Give it the works, Ethel. 
[02:53:00]  The duster's big enough to dig it.  A duster.  Wow.  Her test.  I like the torsion bar suspension with lateral control on it.  Going into a field with it.  And the body, reinforced by steel girders.  More sex.  She's all sexy in this.  She's all sexed up.  The guy that runs the dealership wants to fucking mouth fuck her.  Yeah.  Her size.  They're riding through a crop.  For tight little spaces.  Mr. Titchener, what kind of a young man would be attracted to this?  It's your voice.  Yes.  Of course.  The engineer would love it.  An engineer I got. 
[02:53:30]  What I need now is a son-in-law.  I need a son-in-law.  Plymouth Duster.  Oh, my daughter wants to give the car the test my daughter did one time.  It was to lay in the back and allow three Negroes to ejaculate on her.  That's what she did at the dealership.  And oh boy, was the heck to pay for that.  That was what she would enjoy doing.  She would allow the Negroes to ejaculate on her.  She wouldn't even let them in the car.  They would just do it through the window.  And they would yell, white bitch.  That's preposterous. 
[02:54:00]  I didn't go for that at all.  I need a son-in-law.  I need a son-in-law.  And a daughter who doesn't sniff and huff paint and glue.  My daughter huffs.  She's got meth teeth, my daughter.  Teeth are falling out.  She eats corn in the car, but I hear the ka-chinkity, ka-chinkity.  And that's a bunch of her teeth.  We got it.  What is that lovely lady doing nowadays, you think?  Fucking, that's 40 years ago, right? 
[02:54:30]  George is 40 years ago.  Yeah, old bag.  So she's got to be like 60 now.  I was watching an ultra bright commercial with Farrah Fawcett, too.  They had one of those, and she was all young and hot.  Really?  Yeah.  Ultra bright, and they show nobody in our listening audience.  Toothpaste.  Thanks.  It's funny.  The taste you could really feel ultra bright gives your mouth.  Who's sex appeal?  Let's do the next one.  We've gone bananas for big banana in crayons. 
[02:55:00]  You've learned to write a bunch of bananas in class.  Oh.  Everybody's wearing a banana suit.  How are they wearing a banana suit, Uncle Paul?  How adorable.  But why?  They look like yellow peenies.  Everybody's got on a big banana hat.  Yay!  That's Charles Nelson Reilly, by the way.  Is he playing part of the teacher?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the big banana trying to sell the big banana.  I auditioned for this commercial. 
[02:55:30]  You did?  Yeah.  They loved it.  I kept grabbing the kids in their banana outfits and making the up and down motion.  Like, put those kids down, you.  Remind me, we've got to look up the brisbee, which is a whammo frisbee with a pot pipe on it.  Oh, I remember that.  They called it the bakebee and shit like that.  Really?  Yeah.  And they just sold it on TV?  No, not on TV.  Oh, okay.  It was like at a head shop.  They would sell it.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I thought it was an actual commercial.  I'm like, man.  Those things were stupid.  I know things were crazier back then. 
[02:56:00]  I didn't realize it was that crazy.  It was a wild time.  It was a wild time.  So what are they selling with the bananas?  Just bananas?  No.  Remember the Bic pen?  The Bic banana?  Sure, of course.  That's what they're selling.  The Bic banana pen.  All right.  Let's play this.  Oh, you can learn to color.  Write smooth lines or fast.  Oh.  Draw a banana and give it a hat.  Okay, but you'll go bananas.  Perfect banana crayon.  You'll learn to write a lot of ways.  And how do they handle Charles Nelson Reilly? 
[02:56:30]  We all had to make believe he wasn't gay.  How did that work back then?  Yeah.  You weren't really allowed to acknowledge anything, right?  It's like Paul Lynde.  I saw an advertisement, an old ad for the Paul Lynde show, where he was, I believe, married.  Oh, really?  And he'd come out from work.  Hi, honey.  Oh.  You know, and he's so obviously over-the-top flamboyant gay.  Can we find that?  And he was-  Let me go back to the commercials.  Yeah, yeah.  Find the Paul Lynde show.  So they thought it would be a good idea that they could trick America into thinking? 
[02:57:00]  Back then, people thought Liberace was fucking, you know, looking for chicks.  People just didn't know, you think?  I don't know.  Because we were too young.  I didn't know shit when I was growing up.  I think it's a Y.  It's about Paul Lynde.  But did our parents know that Paul Lynde and Charles Nelson Reilly were gay, you think?  And Liberace was gay?  Or they didn't know either?  Well, he's a little, you know, he's just showy.  He's different.  But do they know?  Can we-  I think there's just an ad for it.  Like a promo?  Find a promo. 
[02:57:30]  He's opening his briefcase, falls, the wind blows all the papers.  Oh, it's crazy.  Yeah, fall show promo.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  What kind of papers do you think are falling out of that briefcase?  Paul and Howie play the son-in-law game.  It's a pure joy.  Guess what it is?  It's a baggie.  You got a job?  Job?  You're going to get one if it doesn't even know what it is.  Share the joy of family living with Paul Lynde.  The Paul Lynde Show. 
[02:58:00]  Paul's daughter's family runs away from home tomorrow on ABC.  Tomorrow on ABC.  Paul Lynde was the father and husband.  Yeah, yeah.  And the daughter was going out with some guy that looked like Paul Lynde wanted to blow him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Watch Paul Lynde boo that hole between his wife's legs.  Watch Paul Lynde vomit at the very thought.  Watch Paul Lynde's wife get him to leave the room by putting her fingers in the dirty hole in the front of her body, as he calls it. 
[02:58:30]  She wants to watch her programs, and Paul is talking and being flamboyantly over the top.  So she puts her fingers in that shotgun wound, as Paul refers to it, and waves it around the room, and Paul leaves through the window.  That's a dirty place.  So, is there another Paul Lynde clip?  Find another Paul Lynde clip.  Please.  Paul Lynde has a married man.  What a terrible show that was.  The Paul Lynde Show.  I don't remember.  I guess he was doing well on, uh...  Is that Harry Reasoner? 
[02:59:00]  Harry Reasoner?  I don't know.  Yeah, it was.  Holy fuck.  He was doing good on Hollywood Square, so I guess they figured they'd give him a show.  All right.  Yeah, put it on part one, Sam.  I'll smash it.  Him or Charlie Weaver.  72, this is.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Let's hear the opening, Jordan.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  He's just walking out of the house under a bridge.  It's a very Mary Tyler Moore opening.  Can you move that arrow or I'll bite you?  He's getting to his car, and then the briefcase opens.  Getting into an old catty fucking ragtop. 
[02:59:30]  This can laughs in the opening?  Oh, Paul Lynde Show.  And then the Paul Lynde Show graphic comes up.  Terrible music.  He's driving now.  It's just a scene starring Paul Lynde.  Oh, no, he's got a Chevy Impala.  Harry Ackerman.  They go right to the exec producer.  That's how unfamous these people are.  How terrible is this music?  William Asher.  I used to see his name all the time.  The director?  Little Bill.  Oh, he's coming home.  He was leaving the office.  And he's getting out the passenger side. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, a bird just shit on his windshield.  That's crazy.  That's what the laughter is.  This is the longest intro.  I love canned laughter in the back.  He's coming in the house.  Quick, my double martini.  I've been to the front again.  Hello, dear.  How goes the rat race?  The rats are winning.  Well, I have your martini already.  Good.  Martini.  Anton. 
[03:00:30]  Paul, I'm very glad you're home because I have something to tell you that shouldn't be a disappointment.  Pause.  That gaping hole between my legs is not temporary.  A dick does not grow from this.  Yes, I have news which shouldn't be alarmed.  I have this new disease.  They don't know what it's called.  I don't know how I got it.  Oh, God.  I haven't been doing anything on my long drives up and down the parkway.  I have something to tell you. 
[03:01:00]  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Let's hear this.  This is going to be a two-martini story?  It is.  I don't want to hear it.  Okay.  I will tell you.  Martha, what is it?  Well, Barbara came home from college today with her degree.  Oh, terrific.  Thank you.  Well, that's not the only thing she came home with. 
[03:01:30]  Uh-oh.  To finish this, you might need it.  All right, Martha, have with it.  Well, the other thing she came home with was a friend.  Oh.  So?  A male friend.  Oh.  Oh, that's all right.  Pause.  I've gotten many of those.  Did she meet him in the bathroom through a hole that they were whispering to each other?  I tapped my foot a couple of times under the bathroom. 
[03:02:00]  That's how you let the undercover officers know you want to do it on their penises.  It's time she started thinking seriously about marriage and things like that.  She's past thinking about it, Paul.  Huh?  She and this friend stopped off in Las Vegas this morning and got married.  Married?  Yes?  You mean she eloped?  Yes.  And say a negro.  It's not romantic. 
[03:02:30]  It's illegal.  Why, she's just a baby.  How'd you find out about this?  Only this afternoon.  What's with the voice?  I'm saving the good news till when you got home.  If it's such good news, why were you saving it?  Well, he's a very nice boy, Paul.  He is entertaining, though, Paul.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he is.  Everything he says is just kind of funny.  Yeah, the way he's saying shit is the way he looks like, ah, I don't know.  I'm like, Martha.  He's disgusted with everything. 
[03:03:00]  Everyone accepts him as a straight guy there, though.  That's what's weird.  Because if this was on TV today, you're like, all right, this is a goof.  Yeah, this would be like, who is...  No one would buy into this.  Who is really over-the-top gay right now?  That's like out there that everybody knows is gay.  Well, besides Sam and Travis.  Dr. Gay.  Over-the-top gay.  Like a celebrity.  Over-the-top gay guy.  Situation?  Who the fuck should always have a gay guy?  Oh, what's that American Idol guy? 
[03:03:30]  Adam Lambert.  Yeah, Adam Lambert.  That would be...  This is actually like Adam Lambert doing a sitcom where he's married with a wife and...  Yeah, Perez Hilton.  That type of gay.  Married, wife, kid, and actually trying to play it off without trying to be, like, ironic about it.  This is actually enjoyable.  Paul Land.  And a lot of people say Seth MacFarlane stole Paul Land's character and turned him into an alien on American Dad.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I always knew that.  That's supposed to be a Paul Land character.  But maybe, like, the younger generation doesn't know. 
[03:04:00]  You know, Paul Land?  He didn't steal it.  It's an homage.  I still remember the Paul Land Halloween special.  I didn't like it because he was teasing Gene Simmons' shoes.  Go down in your elevator shoes.  Oh, right.  Oh.  I didn't care for that back then.  You see the headline today?  Kiss and Motley Crue?  This summer?  Oh, yeah.  I saw that yesterday.  I've known that for a long time.  Do you have a problem with that?  Is there a problem that you have with Kiss and Motley Crue?  Is there any reason you brought it up and didn't pay me to talk about...  Shut up!  Oh, fucking... 
[03:04:30]  Ugh.  In the end, the sap got married.  Yeah, he did.  I know.  Remember?  Yeah.  Remember how he told everyone else?  That's right.  Yeah.  In the end, the sap got married.  That's right.  My pal Gene got married.  What the fuck?  How about if he said he was sorry?  I'm with Anna on this one.  Nah, I don't care.  He's incapable of being sorry.  He comes across like a douche.  Yeah.  His music might be great, but he's a douche.  I'm not a big fan.  God of Thunder.  No. 
[03:05:00]  What happens here?  Yeah, let's get back to Paul and Joe.  Where's Barbara?  She's upstairs unpacking.  And where's this very nice boy?  We're upstairs in Barbara's room.  Where's Barbara?  The Stranger?  Paul, dear, they're married.  Now, try to hold that thought.  I guess I should be grateful for that.  Kids these days hardly bother with that formality.  You forgot the vermouth. 
[03:05:30]  I didn't forget it.  Stop.  You know what?  He's fucking funny.  Of course.  I didn't forget it.  Tell me about our new son-in-law.  I could watch this all day.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not bad.  His name is Howie.  I hate it.  And he's only going to be in the house three days a week.  Well, he's a nice young man.  He makes $80 million.  $80 million?  Well, I'll reconsider. 
[03:06:00]  Okay, so more.  Apparently, he's something of a genius.  Genius?  Howie?  Howie?  Howie?  Well, he seems to be a walking encyclopedia of knowledge.  And he's been around the world three times.  Well, so have I with a male escort.  He tied me up and we did poppers.  Around the world.  And he put it in every hole.  Oh, so isn't this great? 
[03:06:30]  So isn't this great?  I said that with a fist up to the watch buried in my colon.  He did die from doing amyl nitrate poppers, right?  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Yeah, Paul Lind.  Did he do that choking thing, too?  Yeah, he was into autoratis asphyxiation and amyl nitrate poppers.  What, did he suffocate?  Loved the gay sex.  Yeah, I think he did.  I believe there was a male escort involved. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, there was some guy involved.  It was very, very turgid or torrid or something.  Turgid is what I am hearing the story.  Yes, right.  This clip's almost over.  Let's go with it.  Yeah, oh, oh.  Fuck it.  Evidently, he's a very well-rounded young man.  Barbara says he's out on the golf course every day.  Every day?  Yes, and he shoots in the low 60s.  What do you shoot, dear?  In men's assholes.  There's something else about him, dear.  I know you're going to enjoy. 
[03:07:30]  He charts the stock market.  And according to Barbara, he's almost never wrong.  Oh, Barbara.  Uh-huh.  He's rich.  What's that, dear?  Nothing important.  Here comes his daughter.  Ew.  By the way, pause.  She kissed at the top of his head because she suspects where his lips are.  Yeah, yeah.  If we're in a contract, she will not kiss Paul Lynn on the lips or face.  Only his head.  That girl. 
[03:08:00]  Not that girl.  That girl played the daughter on The Odd Couple.  Played Felix's daughter on The Odd Couple.  She was also, for a short time, the voice of Lucy on the Charlie Brown special.  You're just a strange man.  I know.  How do you know this stuff?  I just know, like, that era.  Yeah.  She's that annoying voice girl.  I don't know.  I just really fucking...  So weird, man.  I don't know.  I just know that shit.  He's heavy.  He's fat? 
[03:08:30]  No, that means he's groovy.  Well, why did she say so?  Wait a minute.  I think I might be in.  She looks like Jennifer Piccolo from Happy Days, too.  Yeah, it's not her, though.  You sure?  Positive.  When they finally showed what she looked like.  Positive, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Similar, though?  They looked alike.  Yeah, they kind of did look alike.  I love that 70s skirt with the boots.  Oh, yeah.  She's got go-go boots on.  72, man.  72.  How is she married in this?  Because she's, like... 
[03:09:00]  She's not 18.  Well, she's a college student.  She's probably supposed to be 20.  I am.  She came home with her degree, so she could be 22.  Yeah, she came home with her degree.  Unless it was a two-year college.  I almost actually have her fucking name in my head.  That would be crazy.  So it's an F, I think.  Betty Jean Mercury.  No.  So it's an F.  Her last dance.  An F?  Franny.  Freddie Mac.  I'll get it.  Fanny May.  I think I'll get it.  Yeah, all right.  I think I have it.  It took me a whole year to learn groove, hey?  Did Mom tell you he's a genius?  His IQ is 185. 
[03:09:30]  Mmm, all that and wealthy, too.  Here he is, Dad.  This is Howie.  Ferdin', Ferdin'.  Pamela Ferdin'.  How do you do, Mr. Sims?  How do you do, Howie?  Oh.  Nice name.  Nice blonde-haired boy.  Shall we?  What do you have, Howie, Barbara?  Just a little wine for Barbara and myself.  Howie's a great connoisseur of wine.  Oh, really?  Howie, here's one for Barbara.  Thank you.  And one for Howie. 
[03:10:00]  Ha-ha.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you, dear.  No animal nitrate.  A toast to the bride.  Here's to the wings of love.  May they never molt a feather  till my big boots and your little shoes  are under the bed together.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Poland's face is disgusting.  We don't want to hear it.  You wanted two pairs of boots.  Oh, it's cute.  All right, hold on, hold on.  I've got to clear things up. 
[03:10:30]  Pamela Ferdin is the younger daughter.  Right.  And the older daughter,  the one that goes to college,  is the one that's marrying.  Came down the stairs with Howie.  I was confused.  I thought she was the one getting married.  She did look too young.  And it was much, yes, yes.  Gotcha.  That would have been an Uncle Paul  kind of thing.  Yeah.  So Poland is disgusted  with the whole thing.  The thought of his daughter  getting pounded  by this beautiful blonde gentleman  that he would like to have in his mouth.  Why don't you let me take him  for a test, Ron? 
[03:11:00]  He died in 82 of a heart attack, Poland.  Poland, yeah.  But the heart attack was from some stuff.  Under what circumstances, yeah.  Oh.  81.  By the way,  where did you two meet?  At school in the library.  Oh, you're a student, too.  Well, not exactly.  I graduated college  when I was 17.  What were you doing in the library?  Killing time.  I was going through the dictionary  to see how many mistakes  I could find.  Poland's face. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, boy.  What's that?  Well, if you're interested  in Indian people,  I think you'll find it.  It's a pussy.  What's that?  Exactly.  Why is there a lot of matted hair around it?  I don't understand.  Shouldn't you put flowers in it or something?  Oh, my God.  Looks like one of those shoe buffers  in the hotel room. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, fuck.  Right?  Yeah, what's that?  Old statue.  What is that?  It's Xochiquetzel,  the Aztec goddess of fertility.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Don't touch it.  Don't touch it.  Looks like a butt plug to me.  Howie says it's an absolute guarantee 
[03:12:30]  you'll have children.  How lovely.  Sally, why don't you go  and do your homework?  I don't know.  There goes Sally upstairs.  Don't make yourself comfortable, son.  This is your home.  That's very nice of you, sir.  I certainly appreciate it.  Sitting right up next to him.  I appreciate you taking the time  to visit with us.  I know how busy you must be  with the stock market  and that's just a hobby.  I chart stocks on paper,  but I never gamble.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you certainly are  a well-traveled man. 
[03:13:00]  I understand you've been  around the world three times.  Right.  I just finished  the hitch in the Navy.  The hitch.  Now the Navy.  Oh.  Well, uh, tell me, Howie,  what are your primary  business interests?  Until recently,  I was with a national  polling company.  You own this company?  Oh, no.  I was a field employee.  I went around  making surveys.  For every questionnaire  that was filled out,  I got 50 cents. 
[03:13:30]  This guy's...  That's another hobby.  This guy stinks.  That's my living.  Early mornings, I caddy.  Didn't Barbara tell you?  Hey, Opie, caddies.  Nice.  She mentioned that  you were on the golf course.  Yes, she did.  How are you?  You need a ball washer?  He's a butcher  in Eagle Rock, California.  Butcher.  He's like,  You look a little pale.  Howie?  Do you have enough money  to support my daughter?  No, that's why  we were so pleased 
[03:14:00]  when Mother invited us  to move in here.  Mother invited to move in.  Oh, my knees just locked.  I'm used to being on them.  Exactly.  Quick, put a cock in my mouth.  That's what always happens  when my knees hurt.  Get me a pillow  to kneel on.  This only lasted one season.  It's funny.  It doesn't seem that bad.  No, I'm enjoying this.  Paul Lynn is...  Paul Lynn is hilarious.  Fucking pretty goddamn funny.  He's got a little  Dennis Miller to him.  How?  Well, I know.  Tell you that I'm going 
[03:14:30]  to do everything in my power  to make your daughter happy  because I love her.  Let's go upstairs,  Howie,  and finish unpacking.  Oh, boy.  She's in Dutch.  Her wife.  He's a caddy.  Martha.  Barbara married a caddy.  Barbara married a caddy. 
[03:15:00]  Caddy.  It's not bad at all.  Ah, that Paul Lynn.  I think that's the only clip  you could find from the show, though.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.  Oh, there's different parts.  I want to see this show, I think.  I would laugh at this.  You know, there's three, four parts  or something like that.  I don't know.  Did they ever do a biography  on that motherfucker?  They should do a biography on it.  I think so.  Biography.  Jane Actman,  Pamela Ferdin,  you were right.  James Gregory.  Logan was right.  People are saying,  please post a link  to the Paul Lynn show.  What is it on YouTube? 
[03:15:30]  What do we have to do all the work?  Wow, Jerry Stiller  and Anne Miro are in this.  Really?  Stiller and Miro.  I'm guessing they played  the neighbors.  Wacky neighbors.  Wacky neighbors, I bet.  What's the clip there, Sam?  What is it called?  Just the Paul Lynn show?  Paul Lynn show, 1972, part one.  There you go.  That was funny.  Barbara married a caddy.  A caddy.  So gay.  My knees hurt.  He was very popular  on the Hollywood squares  as the center square also. 
[03:16:00]  Can you go to a clip  of that, Sam Center Square, Paul Lynn?  Center Square.  He was funny in that, right?  He made Hollywood squares funny.  Yeah, if it wasn't for Paul Lynn  in the center square,  I don't think it would have done as well.  And that was the place of honor,  was the center square.  Oh, yes, yes.  It was, they put a fist  on the seat just for him.  Oh, look at this,  the contestant.  Oh, go back.  You've got to go back  for the question.  Don't you know how the game is?  Sam, don't you know  how the show works?  Anger, covetousness, 
[03:16:30]  I can never say that.  Lust, gluttony, envy, and sloth  are collectively known as what?  Oh, the Bill of Rights.  There's a big Afro woman  sitting there.  What are they collectively known as?  The, uh, the seven cents.  Paul Lynn must have gotten 
[03:17:00]  so much dick.  Just a funny guy.  I'd fuck him.  By the way, you know  that they had to have  those answers in a minute.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he, he always tried  to make it come off  like it was a improv.  So why could,  why did the show work  when they brought it back?  If everything is written  out of time.  Paul Lynn was saying.  Yeah, he was a,  the interest,  it's just a different era.  Like, it's not the same  interest in that show.  And was he a stand-up, Jimmy?  Do you know of him?  I don't know.  Do not know.  No, he was,  I don't think he was.  He was just one of these  comic actor guys. 
[03:17:30]  Personalities.  Yeah, they had those back then.  Right.  Like Alan Seuss.  Jesus.  What did he say?  What was he,  a quote of something, Sammy?  I don't know.  It was those  Ronan Martin laughing people  that, you know,  they, they weren't comics,  but they were just.  Some had to be.  That ended up on shows  all the time.  Dean Martin's fucking,  he had,  he had a variety show.  Say he was a comedian  and an actor, so.  But they called people  comedians,  even if they didn't do.  I, I, I bet he did though. 
[03:18:00]  I bet Paul Lynn  like did a Vegas show  or something.  It's, it says  here that in 19,  Jesus,  1962 in March,  he was at Cousin Vinny's  in Point Pleasant,  New Jersey  with Jim Norton  this coming weekend.  And then they said  that March 29th  to April 1st,  he went to Caroline's  in New York  and performed his  stand-up act.  Wow.  Time machine shit.  Oh shit.  That's pretty good.  Nice.  I'm going to give myself  a spin clap for that one.  Oh shit.  You got to wiggle the ass 
[03:18:30]  though if you're doing  the spin like that.  His ass is wiggling  the ass.  You got to wiggle  that ass.  Wow.  Let's go.  It's time for the  Busy Buddy show.  I can't wait to listen  today.  Busy Buddy.  Troy's going to be doing  the Busy Buddy show  today, Sam.  I hope so.  You take notes.  What are you going  to talk about today?  Well, the Chris Jericho  interview went very well.  Oh yeah.  Wrestling talk.  Rehashed that.  You're the one  who had him on your show.  No wrestling talk.  Club Soda Kenny  starting trouble.  Yes.  First by telling you  when to go to break. 
[03:19:00]  Then saying that  Fox News was insulting  either the show or Jim  by saying goodbye.  Uh huh.  The Ropers theme  being a phenomenon  on this show.  Of course it is.  Phenomenon.  And a whole bunch  of stuff.  Chicks dunking.  Maybe I'll ask you  know, I'll talk to the  guys who work here  about the biggest  women they've dated.  Something like that.  What do you mean  chicks dunking?  Remember the first hour?  Yeah.  What were we talking  about?  That monster.  I don't know.  It was a while ago.  Oh, dunking a basketball. 
[03:19:30]  That's why you got to  take these notes.  I gotcha.  Oh, you're taking notes  during the show?  Yeah, I've been doing  it for months.  Yeah, what are you  writing a book or something?  And field hockey  being the sexiest sport.  Oh yeah.  Invented by a pervert.  Don't forget that.  Right.  Paul Lynn's funny.  I'm going to start  talking like that.  Oh, do the impression.  Why don't you put on  your backpack or something?  That's terrible.  That wasn't very good.  Chippy Lynn.  Chippy Lynn?  Hey, you look like  you're going to a picnic  or something, Sam. 
[03:20:00]  No.  No.  This is good.  Yeah.  This is a good character.  Hey, what are you doing  putting all your phones  in your backpack  or something?  There's no joke there, though.  Because it's more like  well-rounded.  It's like,  Hey, look,  your banana's all crushed  or something.  Like there was a bunch  of elephants running  through the room  or something.  The table would be crushed  as a banana.  Hey, what are you putting  your computer or something 
[03:20:30]  in your knapsack?  What are you eating  lunch tomorrow?  Two things don't even  go together.  You need some material.  I got material.  What, am I wearing  a shirt or something?  Oh, that's material.  Chippa Lynn still says  something.  I'll be in the center square.  You forgot to mention  this about Paul Lynn.  He was drinking  with a 34-year-old lover  when the dude fell  eight stories out a window  and died.  Wow.  It was kept out of the press 
[03:21:00]  and his career was safe.  Imagine if that shit  happened today.  Wow, really?  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  How did the guy  fall out a window?  I don't know.  Maybe he was a Batman  or something.  That's retarded.  It really is something  of a retarded kid.  Yeah, he might have been  some kind of a villain  or something.  Could you possibly find  this Dr. Tim in Illinois?  He writes,  Hollywood Squares question.  You are the world's  most popular fruit.  What are you? 
[03:21:30]  A bunch of oranges  or something?  What are you?  And Paul Lynn answered,  humble.  That's funny.  Hilarious.  That's a funny thing.  Is that real?  That has to be written for him.  There were plenty of  gay references.  You're the world's  most popular fruit.  What are you?  Humble.  Humble.  That funny fucking  bastard he was, man.  Humble.  You can't find it, probably?  I would have said  I'm a banana  stuck up a butt  or something.  I'm tropical 
[03:22:00]  or something.  You're 1 to 10 again.  What's that?  What's wrong with us?  Oh!  Or something.  Something.  Look at Travis  over there, Chip-A-Lynn.  Hey, he's got his hand  behind his head  or something.  What are you,  in a lounge chair  or something in Ohio?  Oh!  That doesn't make  any sense.  Yeah, it does.  I'll tell you,  99 cents  makes almost a dollar. 
[03:22:30]  Paul-Lynn.  Chip-Lynn.  Chip-A-Lynn.  Chip-A-Lynn.  Yeah!  What are you,  folding up your  quarter something  for your iPhone?  Call, hello.  Oh!  Cool, hello.  Hello.  I want to be  in a center square.  I'll have funny answers.  Like what?  Oh, yeah?  What's that question?  Well, let's go with  you're the world's  most popular fruit.  What are you?  I'm a bunch of  orange bushels  with tangerine hats.  I have two oranges 
[03:23:00]  and a banana  and I'd wink.  I disagree.  I look like a cock.  Circle gets the square.  Oh, no.  I don't know  what that means.  What?  Circle and a square.  What are we,  a bunch of different things?  I'm a triangle.  Oh!  Or something.  Or something.  Yeah.  Let's go home.  You're going to try  this on stage, Chip?  Yeah.  Is this your new?  Chip, I'll in.  I should do  set a square.  Hollywood squares.  What are we,  in California  or something?  Oh! 
[03:23:30]  I got a question.  Heaviest rock band  in America.  Sick fucking puppies.  Sick fucking puppies.  It's like he's spitting  when he says it.  I'll agree with that.  Yeah.  Oh.  X gets the square.  Yes.  Yeah, X gets the square.  What are you going to play?  A tic-tac-toe  or something?  Oh!  How come I don't call  tic-tac fingers?  Oh!  Oh, God.  Jesus.  I remember one time  we played thumbtac-toe.  Oh! 
[03:24:00]  We were putting thumbtacks  and he shut his toes.  I guess you knew that  by the name of the game.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm done with  Chippa.  I found this in.  I found this in.  I found this in.  Does Chippa Lind  ever play Words Back?  It's Words Back.  Yes, I do.  Square Center!  Oh!  Oh!  Square Center!  Take it easy.  I go to the doctor.  See ya.  All right.  We'll be back with more  in a couple minutes.  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[03:24:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like  sticking around  after One Day Live  is next.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And now,  the Opie and Anthony show  continues.  This is  After One Day Live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts.  Yes.  Those headphones don't work. 
[03:25:00]  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Which headphones are these?  Can you not hear anything?  No, they keep going in and out.  Okay, I think I got it.  I think I got it.  Sal, I think the emergency's over.  I think I got it.  The Jack.  There's something.  Which headphones are these?  Stu.  No, they're working now.  I had to fiddle with it, though.  I gotta find...  First of all,  I think we all have to agree 
[03:25:30]  for the sake  of continuing this argument  as to whether or not  Opie and Anthony  were children of the 80s,  that last hour of radio  has got to be stricken  from the record.  Yeah.  Because none  of what was spoken about  had any sort of recollection  in my lifetime whatsoever.  You don't remember  the Paul Lynde show  coming on after He-Man?  No.  No.  I had no...  I know of Paul Lynde  in the sense that  after he died,  people became aware of him.  Yeah.  But in my lifetime,  I have no recollection 
[03:26:00]  of seeing his work  in any sort of  new or live medium whatsoever.  Never.  No.  At all.  Well, you were more  of a child of the late 80s  into the early 90s, right?  I mean, I was born in 83.  It's not that late.  You were born in when?  79?  78.  78.  You're even older.  You don't remember  any of this.  No.  No.  Well, I remember Paul Lynde, 
[03:26:30]  but I think I was older  when I discovered Paul Lynde.  Right, you found out about him  after he was dead already.  Because I remember him  doing Hollywood Squares.  But it was reruns.  I remember he was  Uncle Arthur on Bewitched.  Yeah, but you were watching...  It was not like you were watching  the new episode of Bewitched,  was it?  No, they were reruns  on Channel 5.  Yeah, exactly.  Sometime in the afternoon.  The real question  we have to ask ourselves is,  though,  Chippy Lind,  is he a hit?  He's a huge hit.  We were talking about  Jim's characters yesterday  and how Jim has managed  to establish a stable 
[03:27:00]  of characters,  some of which are hated,  some of which are loved.  I think across the board,  Valley Jim is the most hated character.  Edgar has developed a fan base,  as we talked about,  but today we saw the debut  of Chip's new stage persona,  Chippy Lind,  where he's just kind of  stealing Paul Lind's whole routine.  Hit or no hit?  Eric, you say hit.  Huge hit.  You are. 
[03:27:30]  How does it rank  with the rest of his characters?  I still think  Ted's number one,  Uncle Paul's number two.  Were you able to find...  Well, you like Uncle Paul a lot  because you get it.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  I get it from Uncle Paul  or I get what he's talking about?  Yeah, either way.  I don't...  No, I don't...  You just agreed to either being...  I'm not sympathizing  or relating to what  Uncle Paul was talking about.  Just now,  you just said,  yeah,  like you were either molested  or you can relate to him 
[03:28:00]  in the sense that  you're attracted to young children.  No, I was not molested.  So which one?  Okay, so you do have a thing  for young children.  No, I don't.  But then...  No, I mean,  you can't go back on that now.  You said what you said  and that's cool with me.  I don't mind it.  Were you ever able  to find any  G-yogurt litty?  No, I'm still looking  because it's...  Some of those early notes  from 2005 are a little...  They're not as detailed  as they are now.  We're running by the seat  of our pants back then,  Iraq.  Nobody knew how long  it would take  before we got thrown  off the air. 
[03:28:30]  We certainly didn't think  we'd still be rotting away here.  Wow, how many?  Seven years later.  Yeah.  It's the longest run  the show's ever been on.  It'll be eight  this October.  It's October.  Ha, ha, ha.  Well, yeah,  I think it's unanimous  across the board  that Chippeland,  Chippeland  is 100% a hit.  Who's in there with you?  One of the interns  just left  and Paul came in.  Where does Paul  rank the characters?  Paul, where do you  rank Jimmy's characters? 
[03:29:00]  Oh, Deer and Headlights.  Here we go.  Well, he would be  number one, obviously.  Well, where...  What do you think  of Chippeland?  What do you think  of Chippeland?  Oh, fantastic.  He's confused, isn't he?  I think so.  He's flustered.  You can hear it.  He's not ready  for the big time.  He's not ready  for the spotlight.  Maybe he should  sit back down.  Once again, he chokes.  Well, it's what happens  here on After Opie  and Anthony Live  sometimes,  or if you want  to call it,  I guess some would  call it the busy...  I don't know  if it's Busy Bodies  or Busy Buddies show. 
[03:29:30]  The club show  Kenny has named  this thing.  I think that  he meant  Busy Buddies  except he's got  a speech impediment  so it sounded  like Busy Buddies  and then  that's what  it's become.  I don't think  Kenny was clever  enough to think  of Busy Buddies.  I think he just  thought...  He just said  Busy Buddies  and everybody  misunderstood him.  But today,  it was Club  so did Kenny  who was the Busy Buddy  as he always is.  He was calling 
[03:30:00]  the show  apparently  telling the show  when to take  a break  which Opie and  Anthony did  what he said  and we ended up  having to wait  five minutes  live on the air  with nothing to do  because we were  waiting to simulcast  Jim Norton's  Fox News  appearance today.  Then,  he comes in here  and he starts  saying that  Fox News  when Jim left  was saying  something unkind  about Jim  at the end  when all they  were saying  was we're sad  to see you go. 
[03:30:30]  That's a compliment  if nothing else.  But Club  so did Kenny  stuck his nose  in other people's  business again  and look what happens.  He's going to  wind up calling  because you're not  talking very kind  about him.  I'm not talking  kind or unkind.  I'm saying  what it is.  He is the one  who has a tendency  of sticking his nose  in people's business  you know.  He came in here  the other day  and started talking  about me and Troy  and started making  things up.  This thing has caught  on and I'm telling 
[03:31:00]  you if my job  here is being  defined as somebody  who sticks his nose  in other people's  business or reports  what other people  are doing,  that's what we're  going to talk about.  The fact that  Club so to Kenny,  the security guard  for the Opie and  Anthony show,  is all over the  place in terms of  causing chaos  and sticking his  nose where it  don't belong  and making things  more difficult  for people  because today  things got more  difficult during  that break 
[03:31:30]  for Opie and  Anthony  and things have  been more  difficult for me  because I have  to explain myself  over something  that doesn't exist.  So if anybody's  a busy buddy  around here,  it's Club so to  Kenny.  I mean,  that's it.  I don't see  what's so hard  to figure out  about this.  Eric?  So are you  going with the  official title  Busy Buddy?  No.  Are you going  to correct it?  The show's called  After Opie and  Anthony Live.  It's been called  many things  throughout its  incarnation.  Alright,  I gotta change  the pad data.  You can call it  whatever you want, 
[03:32:00]  but it's a show  that's live  that comes on  after Opie and  Anthony,  and sometimes we  talk about what  they did on the  show.  That's all the  show is.  It's called  After Opie and  Anthony Live,  but we bring the  curtain back,  and we also,  you know,  share with the people  what's going on  behind the scenes.  Everybody is  wondering,  you know,  what's Roland  doing back there?  Who's he booking  today?  What's Dr. Gay up  to?  What's the diagnosis  from Dr. Gay,  and who on earth 
[03:32:30]  is Troy?  Everybody's wondering  these things,  and the purpose of  After Opie and  Anthony Live is to  clear up whatever  questions are  remaining after the  Opie and Anthony  show.  You know?  You got people  feedbacking in now  that just want to  sound off and say  Chippy Lynn sounds  sexy.  Yeah,  maybe some people  are going to be  sexually attracted to  Chip Chipperson's new  character.  I don't know.  That was fast.  I mean,  attraction is one of 
[03:33:00]  those things.  Sexual attraction can  come in an instant,  and that's just what  happens sometimes.  But,  we have to call it  what it is here on  After Opie and  Anthony Live,  because that's the  purpose of the show,  isn't it?  That's the only  reason we're here,  to bring everyone  up to speed,  and to keep everybody  on the same even  keel.  I think it's a good  thing,  but,  apparently,  Club Soda Kenny  doesn't.  He wants to change  things up,  and he's allowed to,  but it is what it is. 
[03:33:30]  You know what I mean?  You know,  we have to call it  for what it is.  Jim in Alabama,  you're on After Opie  and Anthony Live,  Hey,  prime time.  I think it's time  you set the record  straight and let  Kenny know there's  only one shit-stirrer  on the show.  And who is that?  It's you.  I mean,  if Club Soda Kenny  wants to come in  and take the  responsibilities,  he can,  but it seems to me  what Club Soda Kenny  is doing is taking 
[03:34:00]  my role of shit-stirrer  and shit-stirring  by calling me  a shit-stirrer.  Look,  there's only,  who wants to be  the guy after the guy?  Right.  Exactly.  There was no,  I'm not sitting here  and being  the next guy.  I'm just the guy.  I'm just Sam.  There's no Sam  before Sam.  It's just Sam.  So if Kenny wants  to be the next Sam,  Kenny can be the next Sam.  But that's not the way,  that's not the way  I got here.  You know?  He's a hater.  You think so?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:34:30]  He's jealous of you  and your talents.  Maybe that's what it is.  I don't know.  Gotta be.  Thank you very much, Joe.  Bye, brother.  What else was going on  on the show today?  Chris Jericho.  Chris Jericho  was great on the show.  Opie was saying  that he wants to get  something the wrestling  blogs will pick up on  and they absolutely will.  Well,  I would say  this is  maybe Chris Jericho's  best appearance  on the show.  He's been on the show  a whole bunch of times  and I think  that this could be it for him. 
[03:35:00]  Hang on.  Duke wants to chime in.  Duke in New Jersey.  You're on  after Open Anthony Live.  What's up, Sam?  Yeah,  Kenny is killing the flow  lately.  He's coming in  with a bunch of crap.  Yesterday,  he totally killed Jim  and Drake Kwan  in the discussion.  He totally fucked it up.  I think he's going through  a terrible midlife crisis.  You think it's a midlife crisis?  A horrible,  terrible one.  Yeah.  I mean,  that could be what it is  because it's true.  I mean,  yesterday,  Troy Kwan and Jim Florentine 
[03:35:30]  got into this argument  about music  and it was like a,  you know,  it was a discussion  more than an argument.  It wasn't like a personal attack.  But once again,  Club Soda Kenny  sticks his nose into things  and...  I'm sorry to cut you off  but I was actually,  as a listener,  interested in that  and then here comes Kenny.  You know what?  You guys need to  find a theme music  for Kenny.  Something like that?  Something like  doo-doo-doo-doo?  Every time he walks in,  just some goofy shit.  Maybe that's what  we need to do.  Thank you, 
[03:36:00]  dude.  I'm out.  I mean,  I don't know  what to do anymore,  Troy.  I'm glad you're here  to bring the thunder.  Yeah.  But am I wrong?  No.  I think Kenny's  getting a little gun happy too.  You know what I mean?  Like where he's now  just coming in  and just blurting out  whatever he wants.  I mean,  you saw what happened today.  Yeah,  it backfired on him.  Yesterday,  he's chiming in  every five minutes  with some witty dialogue  and people are laughing.  Everything was good.  Now,  today he comes in 
[03:36:30]  and he's making  programming calls  and,  you know,  it kind of blew up  in his face a little bit.  It did.  Yeah.  It kind of made him  look like a bit of an asshole.  That's how you took  his appearance?  I mean,  you know,  I could see where  that would come from.  Right.  Because Opie and Anthony  are now sitting here  for five minutes going,  what the fuck do we do now?  Right.  Thanks for fucking this up.  Because they're professionals.  Right.  They are.  They made it work.  Because that's what they do.  Right.  But they're right about,  you know,  sitting there.  It's a daunting thing.  It's one thing  if you have 20 minutes  that you're like,  okay,  let's get into something. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  But if you've only got  five minutes,  what on earth  are you going to get into?  Exactly.  You know,  and that's the position  they found themselves in.  It would seem like  because of  Club Soda Kenny.  Once again.  You know?  But I have a feeling  that may have  set him back a little bit.  Like he realized,  okay,  maybe I need to go back  to just  sitting outside  and  securing.  Yeah,  make sure nobody  comes into the studio  that shouldn't.  Keeping everybody's,  you know,  keeping everybody safe. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  He does a good job.  I mean,  listen,  I've never been attacked  once working here.  Right.  And I feel like  Club Soda Kenny's job  is to make sure  that the people  who work for the show  don't get attacked.  I definitely feel like  this is a safer place  with Kenny around.  I've never seen  Opie or Anthony  get attacked.  Nope.  And that would obviously  be thanks to  Club Soda Kenny.  However,  I have seen them  in uncomfortable  positions on the air.  That's also  partially  thanks to  Club Soda Kenny.  And I've seen the show 
[03:38:00]  completely derailed.  Yeah.  And that's because of  Club Soda Kenny.  So it's like  if we could just  highlight his  positive attributes  more.  Right.  And kind of  push back  those negative  things,  maybe we'd get  somewhere.  Uh-oh,  he just hung up.  Well,  we'll talk to Suzanne  in Long Island.  What's up,  Suzanne?  Hey,  guys,  I just want to  let you know  that Chippy Lynn  is one of the  funniest things  I've heard  in a really long  time.  I was in tears  when,  laughing so hard 
[03:38:30]  when Jimmy  was doing it.  And I tweeted  Jimmy and I said  I hope that  Chippy Lynn  makes an appearance  tomorrow.  Well,  Chippy Lynn,  it's because he  says or something  but he does it  in the Paul Lynn  voice.  Yes.  That's what does it  for me,  the or something  in the Paul Lynn  voice.  It's very funny  and you guys  are great  and I'm  punching out.  Thank you.  Thank you,  Suzanne.  Now,  Troy,  you have had  a problem  with Chris Jericho  for a little while.  I have.  Has this been  brought up  on the air  before?  No.  I wish it  had today.  I mean,  obviously he had  to get out 
[03:39:00]  of here  because he's  doing a ton  of stuff  in New York  today.  Yeah.  He was actually  supposed to be,  he wasn't even  doing any other  shows at Sirius.  He was supposed  to do a couple  of them.  But he was  doing TV,  he was going  over to Fox,  he's doing  Fallon tonight,  he's all over  the place.  So he was in  here and we  had a limited  amount of time.  I had to get  in the Virgil  question.  That was important.  You know,  we had to talk  about WrestleMania,  we had to talk  about music,  we had to talk  about the fact  that him  and Jim Norton  are text buddies. 
[03:39:30]  You know how  Chris Jericho  and Norton  are text buddies?  CM Punk,  professional wrestling  superstar,  WWE champion,  replies to Jim  on Twitter,  just like,  oh,  funny tweet.  Yeah.  That makes me  very envious.  Rightly so.  Because these wrestlers,  and I told off the air  during the commercial,  I said,  I feel like if I was  not a wrestling fan,  I'd have an easier  time building that  bridge.  You come across  as a major fanboy.  You think so?  Yeah,  where Norton  is just kind of  like hanging out. 
[03:40:00]  Plus,  Norton's an established  comedian,  so they're probably  like,  I respect what you do.  Yeah.  Whereas with me,  Chris Jericho  said it best  when he said,  you don't do anything.  I just see you  sitting in this chair  all the time.  Right.  You don't do anything.  Right.  Like,  if you were hanging  out with Chris Jericho,  you met up to do  something,  he'd be afraid  you would pull out  a camera and be like,  hey,  can I grab a picture  quick?  Or,  listen,  you know,  yeah,  but still,  you're that kind of guy.  I'm sure he's been around  enough of those dudes  that are like, 
[03:40:30]  I'm not E-Rock,  okay?  I wouldn't do something  like that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah,  yeah.  But I don't ask him  for pictures when he's  in the studio anymore.  I've taken a photo with him.  I've gotten him to sign  my chair and all that.  Now we're just cool.  Yeah.  I just wish he would  realize that.  He,  well,  he's not going to.  No.  You come across  as too much of a fanboy.  But I'm not going  to give that up either.  Like,  I'm not going to pretend  I'm not a fanboy.  Then just be,  be who you are.  Exactly.  I was born this way.  I'm on the right track,  baby.  You know what I mean?  You,  however,  have a bit of a problem 
[03:41:00]  with Chris Jericho.  Yeah,  I just,  I guess I don't,  I don't really like him,  but I don't,  I don't not like him either.  Why don't you like him?  Well,  it's kind of funny  because back in the day,  my band was signed  to Megaforce Records.  And we,  we had sat with our manager  at the time.  This was the band  that all the members  of the band  fucked a girl  and then he rock cuddled  with her.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's the band.  Okay.  So we were signed to Megaforce.  Just bringing everyone  up to speed.  Okay. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  We were signed to Megaforce  and we had sat down  with our manager,  Johnny Zazula at the time.  And,  you know,  he was like,  you know,  we're doing this for you guys.  We're going to do that  for you guys.  And,  you know,  really talked up a lot of shit.  And we put a lot of,  you know,  effort into our record  and we were excited  at the time.  And then all of a sudden,  you know,  is he signed Fozzy.  And at that time,  like wrestling to me  had become a goof.  Yeah.  So it was like,  I was looking at Fozzy  and being like,  really? 
[03:42:00]  And this was also  when Fozzy was a goof band.  Yeah.  It wasn't,  was it?  I mean,  when they first came out,  they were like,  they were,  a lot of what they did  was borrowed from a,  what's the movie?  The documentary,  the Chris Guest documentary.  Spinal Tap.  Spinal Tap, yeah.  A lot of what they were doing  was borrowed from Spinal Tap.  Chris Jericho was doing a character.  Yeah.  And he was being,  and this was when they signed.  Yeah.  Okay.  And it was just like,  really?  And you were like,  this is what your time,  effort,  and money are going into  for the label?  Well,  did you understand 
[03:42:30]  that he was like a giant star?  Yeah,  but it's just,  it's disappointing  because you have this band  and you're so excited  about the future of your band  and you're told  all these things.  Okay.  So he sold you  a bill of goods.  Yeah.  That and,  uh,  there was an artist  on the label  at the time  named Biff Naked.  Oh,  the chick?  Yeah.  I remember her.  She got,  she had a couple singles.  Yeah.  Well,  they put all the effort  into Fozzie and Biff Naked  and not into the band  I was in.  So you got,  you're still a little jealous.  Yeah,  it just sucks.  And now Jericho's coming in here  and being like,  yeah,  I'm playing to, 
[03:43:00]  first I'm going to wrestle  at WrestleMania  in the main event  and then I'm going to go play  in front of 70,000 people  in England  with Black Sabbath.  Yeah.  And you're like,  I got a production piece  to work on  and I got to fucking deal  with Club Soda Kenny  every day.  Yeah.  That's okay.  I mean,  it's now  and it's all worked out  but,  you know,  I still have a little bit of,  like when I see him  it's just like,  ugh.  Because it's the envy.  Yeah.  And you're like,  why,  but you understand  that of course  they're going to put attention  into his band  when he's on 
[03:43:30]  a giant TV show  every week.  Like,  he's an established guy.  Maybe not in music  at that point  but he's got a built-in fan base.  Of course.  But yeah,  it was like,  really like,  why is this guy doing music?  This is a total fucking goof.  So you were mad  that he was doing music at all?  Yeah.  Like,  fuck that guy for doing music.  I'm trying to do music.  Yeah,  I was like,  dude,  take off your fucking clothes,  get into a Speedo  and wrestle.  Right.  You know,  like,  don't come over to this world.  But then he came over  and he kind of killed it,  didn't he?  I mean,  apparently.  Kind of blew up in your face,  didn't he? 
[03:44:00]  Yeah,  it's okay.  Where's your band,  you know?  Yeah,  exactly.  Well,  it's fine.  It actually worked out  for the better.  Why is that?  Well,  because that band was done,  so.  Good,  donezo.  Yeah.  But it still sucks.  Yeah,  because you had this deal  kind of dangled in front of your face  and then the big wrestler  comes along  and destroys everything.  Exactly.  Eric,  there's nothing you could do to help?  I know you used to  illegally get them  on the charts and stuff.  No,  I was long gone by that point.  That's a shame.  I did want to play,  though,  for everybody.  since Chris Jericho was in here  and it was referenced on the show, 
[03:44:30]  like,  Jericho and Norton  are friends.  Not like they hang out all the time,  but they're,  like,  they're cool.  They're cool.  Yeah.  They text each other.  They have each other's phone numbers  and they used it to send text messages.  That's huge.  That makes,  that's something that makes me envious.  I know how you feel,  Troy.  But,  his,  when was this now?  In 2008 when he came in here?  2007.  2007.  Wow.  It was 2007. 
[03:45:00]  He came on.  Have you ever heard this,  Troy?  This was,  uh,  the classic Jericho Norton fight.  I heard about this.  You've never heard it.  I don't know the audio,  no.  You gotta hear it.  It's,  uh,  it's,  it's amazing  that they're still cool after this  because this was,  like,  beyond tense  and it just went on  and on  and on.  Yeah,  now you got,  just so you know,  the original segment  was,  like,  49 minutes  of just being uncomfortable.  I chopped it down  to several minutes,  so.  To several minutes?  Uh, 
[03:45:30]  two,  three,  four,  five,  about six minutes.  All right,  so we're just giving you,  and you're just,  it's not,  it's right,  it's the whole,  it's what started it  and the whole heat  of everything.  Yeah,  so,  I mean,  we had no idea  what was happening  at this point.  At one point,  Master Poe went in the studio  and that just insulted Jericho  because Jericho was like,  just because I'm a wrestler  doesn't mean I don't have  the power to speak  without raising my fists  to him.  And we never waved  for Poe to come in either.  No,  of course not.  But,  check it out.  This is 
[03:46:00]  the Jericho Norton fight.  We'll be back.  Actually,  we're not going anywhere.  This is part of the show  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I actually played  in a celebrity,  Christopher Reeve used to have  a celebrity game  at the Garden.  I played four years  with it.  It was great.  But the one year  I asked my dad.  Jimmy.  My dad could come.  Jimmy's itching.  Don't fuck around with Chris.  He was a good dude.  Yeah,  why would I?  I can see your wheels spinning.  Not at all.  Jimmy's itching.  The third eye  you all blink off.  Oh,  terrible.  What?  Oh,  my God.  He kicked your chair.  Terrible. 
[03:46:30]  Everybody's going in.  You know what?  Christopher Reeve  in a wheelchair  could still kick your ass.  Not a big deal.  Good for him.  Great answer.  I thought you were supposed  to be a comedian.  That wasn't funny.  But anyways,  I have a story about it,  you jackass.  Don't interrupt my story.  I can't even tell the story now.  It's been built up so much.  He's really mad at me.  Well,  he was a friend of mine.  You don't talk shit  about someone's friend like that.  Yeah,  well,  that's true,  but he was a very famous guy  and we poke fun at it.  We do it.  It's not that it's nice,  but we do it.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Jimmy gets his ass kicked 
[03:47:00]  right after these words.  Opie and Anthony,  the host of the show,  your bosses,  are being respectful.  And you got across the line  when I said,  don't say it.  Well,  I wasn't being disrespectful.  Yes,  you were.  It's very disrespectful.  You didn't say you were friends with him.  I'll be honest with you.  I was this close  to being disrespectful,  but Jimmy jumped on it first.  But you didn't say it.  First of all,  you didn't say you were friends with him.  You just said you played  in the tournament with him.  I'm just kidding with you,  man.  I was actually going to go with the,  I could see your wheels spinning  when he said that. 
[03:47:30]  I was going to go on that.  See,  I threw you a softball.  See,  I was going to go on that part.  I would love to see him put Jimmy  in some type of finishing hole.  You know what it is?  You know what the finish is?  Jimmy can bend at least three times.  Here's the finishing hole.  That hole.  Oh.  That's the finish.  That whole crowd.  Not punching him  because Jimmy doesn't have  any bones in his face.  So,  just your fist  That whole crowd out there,  that whole crowd out there  would have stood up  if you hit Jimmy  and said,  leave him alone.  Please don't do that. 
[03:48:00]  Nobody would have helped me.  Of course not.  We're not going to do that.  No, no, no, no.  You really are,  but it's okay.  I didn't know he was a friend.  No, no, no, no.  No, my fury is over.  I'm happy.  I'm happy.  We love you.  We love each other.  And I am a comedian.  You didn't think it  because it wasn't a funny line,  but I am one.  Good.  Now, he feels bad.  I was laughing at the awkwardness.  Let's shake hands on air.  There you go.  Their hands are shaking.  We're fine.  We're buddies again.  They're okay now.  That was a little awkward.  That was.  You know, it was awkward.  But it was beautifully awkward.  You got to stick up  for your buds, right?  I mean, that's just the way it is.  Not really.  Not these. 
[03:48:30]  Not these guys.  Not these guys.  We're a bunch of miscreants.  We're a bunch of heathens.  You should go down the county cell  and see how these guys  treat each other.  We're brutal.  It's amazing.  We're just a bunch of scumbags.  It is amazing.  We're just a bunch of scumbags.  That's what we are.  We fucking...  Nothing is sacred.  This is very...  It's very close to home, obviously.  This is going to be interesting.  That's all I'm saying.  Let me say...  My father's a quadriplegic, too.  Well, he's been dead  for a few years.  No, Chris.  His limbs don't fucking work.  See, that's funny. 
[03:49:00]  That's funny.  That's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  You're mad at me.  It's not bullshit.  It is.  It wasn't very funny.  I'm not offended  as a guy who had delivered.  I'm offended as a comedian.  That was just a bad joke.  A third annual blink-off  was not fucking bad.  Look at Anthony's killing it.  I respect his opinion.  And that's what made it weird.  Because I'm laughing  because I thought that was funny.  It was funny.  It's just the third annual blink-off.  And what was funny about it?  It's the word blink.  What? 
[03:49:30]  And a blink-off will never happen.  And I got Patrice and Anthony  to laugh at that.  Guys, this conversation  is just going nowhere for me.  I know.  If you want me to continue  to participate,  we know the story now.  Let's just move along  and have some fun  and talk about cocks and stuff.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  We've reached this point.  Oh, my God.  Listen to the silence.  Oh, no.  I will close this part of my...  Had you said to me,  look, this is the situation...  I shouldn't have to.  There's certain things  that just aren't funny.  See, okay.  Well, then you're...  To me.  But again, I'm not a mind reader,  so if you told me that,  I would have certainly been respectful.  I said, don't cross the line. 
[03:50:00]  How much more do you say?  Don't say it.  I can see your wheels spinning.  We were already in the middle of it.  Had you set it up like that,  I'm just telling you,  it would have been different.  Yeah.  Man, your people listening to this show  just getting burnt  like they're getting a buzzkill.  They're going to have some fun on this.  No, they're fucking...  Chris, they're fucking vultures, man.  Our audience are fucking vultures.  Look at the smiling, grinning faces  on these creepers out there.  He doesn't like me.  I know he doesn't like me.  I know he's a jock.  He wants to punch me.  That's what they do.  I get it.  No, no, no.  I get it.  I'm smart.  I go and wire your car  so when you get downstairs... 
[03:50:30]  I don't have a car.  Do you have a car?  No, just wire clubs out of Kenny.  He's stupid.  Dude, I'm not mad at you anymore.  I'm over it.  But your feelings are hurt.  I can tell.  You're not a good psychologist.  My feelings are not hurt.  No, I'm not.  But you've got a different look  on your face now, though.  Well, Jimmy,  I'm not going to be phony about it.  Don't be phony.  Don't be defensive.  Just move on, man.  Jimmy can hold a grudge  like Simon Wiesenthal.  I'm only irritated  that he said like...  Simon Wiesenthal.  I was telling him  I was being respectful. 
[03:51:00]  Like, had I known that situation,  I would have been respectful of it.  I really would have been  for anybody.  But what he's saying,  but I told you not to...  Like, that's what's bugging me  is he's like,  hey, I instructed you not to  and you should have known  that's not my word.  And you should have just  filed his instructions.  He told you.  Now fucking shut up.  So now you want to continue this?  Now you're bugged now?  No, you're asking me  why not for it?  No, I'm telling you  we're over it, man.  You want to continue arguing about it  and disrupt the show?  Because I'll argue all day  if you want.  You just said to me,  I was done with it  and you just said to me, 
[03:51:30]  give us some wacky material.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  No, you see, you can't.  You can't say that  because I would almost  take the beating  to get the laugh I would get.  See?  Oh, no.  Oh, this is...  Killed.  This is nothing...  Can you match this?  This is reality radio.  But look at Opie.  Lean back,  hands behind his head.  But my thing is, Jimmy,  there's no reason  to continue on with this. 
[03:52:00]  You're continuing.  I'm done.  I'm not continuing.  You are.  I'm done.  You said to me  my feelings were hurt  and I was saying  that you were wrong.  They really weren't.  Okay.  That was why I had that  and I explained it.  It was not a winning thing.  Okay, well,  your feelings aren't hurt.  We're both bothered  by something.  We move on.  But let's go.  There's no bothering anymore.  I'm done.  We're done.  It's fun times.  Good times.  I'm done.  Good days.  Good days.  Fun times.  I'm done.  Holy shit, man.  Wow.  You just never know.  Live radio, man.  It's compelling.  You got to love it.  It's like the 50s. 
[03:52:30]  It's like the old Hollywood, man.  Dean Martin.  Fuck.  It's only 1034.  Shit.  I was hoping it would be 11.  This is crazy.  It was like a minute.  And we can't move on.  How does it happen?  What do we do?  This is the great thing  is, oh shit, here we go.  Oh, Paul.  This is a lot.  You gotta explain it, Patrice.  The security guards  just walked into the studio.  Here's the great thing about this.  This is the journey  that's going to be great  is finding out how to move on.  After ONA, this is live. 
[03:53:00]  And it was very difficult to move on.  I completely forgot  that Patrice was in that day.  I did, too,  until I was going through it this morning.  I went, oh shit, right.  And he was such a big part of it, too.  He just instigated and instigated.  Did you hear him turn on Jim at one point?  Were you in the studio?  You were in the studio.  I videoed the whole thing.  Yeah, it was so tense.  It was just like Chris Jericho  and Norton just,  there was venom.  Like, they were just avoiding  eye contact with each other. 
[03:53:30]  There was just hostility,  passive aggressiveness.  I think that if you have the video  or if the video's online somewhere,  it must be somewhere.  I think there's at some points  where while Jericho's saying his side  and Jimmy's saying his side,  Patrice wouldn't say a word.  He would just point.  And he would point at the other person  like you hear what he's saying about you.  And then that got Jimmy going.  Then he'd point back at Jericho  like he was directing the argument.  You're right.  He would sit there.  He wouldn't say anything.  He would just point.  He wouldn't say anything.  He would just point to people like,  yeah, he's got a point.  Oh, he's got a point, too. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just watching this thing go on and on.  And it really was like it never  got OK that day.  Like it never was not tense.  It took a while.  But then like I get, you know,  they see each other on the set of this TV show.  He comes in a couple more times.  And now they're like friends  to the point that I'm jealous.  They both have radio shows on the same channel.  No, they're not.  No, they're not on the same channel.  They're both on the Boneyard.  No, Rocket Jericho's not on the Boneyard.  It's on Sixth Sense.  Oh, they moved him. 
[03:54:30]  On Sixth Sense.  It used to be on the Boneyard.  A hair nation?  I don't know.  Motley Crue,  what, one,  64,  I don't have the sheet in front of me.  I think it's on,  I think Sixth Sense is one of those channels  that like  is almost syndicated.  You know what I mean?  How there's like a group of channels  on SiriusXM's that's actually syndicated.  We don't program them ourselves.  We were doing something for the Boneyard  and we couldn't find it online.  They don't really make it easy  where to find Chris Jericho's show  on SiriusXM.  No, I mean, 
[03:55:00]  I only,  I had to look up Chris Jericho's Twitter.  That's why I think,  go to like,  I don't know.  Actually,  Eric,  just Google  Rock of Jericho.  You're saying XM164.  Yeah,  XM164,  whatever that is.  I think it's  Sixth Sense  is the name of the channel.  Oh, yeah,  you're right.  Yeah.  Oh,  well,  I knew it was,  I apologize then  because when it was just  two separate companies,  he was on Boneyard.  Back in the day.  Yeah.  DJ Hook had just stopped in  for a second.  What's up,  man?  Did you hear,  did you hear this? 
[03:55:30]  Have you ever been into  like an argument  with somebody that you know  could beat the shit out of you?  Like a pro wrestler?  Hell yeah.  You have.  You get your shit  knocked out of you though?  I had beef with the  John Bones Jones guy.  You didn't have any beef  with him,  I was there.  You didn't have any beef  with him.  I'm lying.  You're just a liar.  You lie all the time.  You're trying to sound tough.  You know,  I had a beef with  John Bones Jones.  Yeah,  you stepped down.  Nah,  I'm name dropping.  But yo,  I've never had a beef  with a wrestler though.  No.  I always thought they were fake. 
[03:56:00]  Like,  they don't really fight  because it's all  a reenactment.  Well,  try like...  I know they do steroids  and all that,  but...  I don't think they do  steroids anymore.  Of course they do.  What do you mean  of course they do?  Of course they do.  There's a drug policy  in place.  Dude,  there's ways around all that.  You can do natural shit.  Natural?  Yeah,  it's called working out.  That's natural.  Extra testosterone  and shit like that.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no.  There's testosterone levels  tested on the regular.  But you could put that  in your ass too?  Like,  what's the difference  between steroids 
[03:56:30]  and natural liquid  going in your ass?  Well,  I don't know  what kind of natural liquid  goes in your ass  but it would depend  on the testing.  Oh,  oh.  Yeah,  they do,  they inject themselves  with like bull sperm  and shit,  don't they?  No,  because testosterone levels  are checked now.  They go,  they've gone crazy  with drug testing  since the Benoit thing.  The last thing they need  is another wrestler  going nuts  because of some kind  of drugs  or them relating it  to drugs  and killing their family  and stuff.  It's one little  isolated incident.  That's what I say. 
[03:57:00]  Move on.  It's no biggie.  It's show business.  Yeah,  exactly.  But those wrestlers  are really tough though.  I was hanging with  The Rock in Vegas.  He's so pussy.  You think The Rock  is pussy?  He ain't like,  no,  he's a fucking teddy bear.  This guy used to wear  a fucking dress on  in a movie.  But that's because  he's an actor.  First of all,  when were you hanging  out with The Rock?  It was three weeks ago  at Taj.  He's like an actor  and he's like nice to people  but you don't think  he could...  He had a fairy...  I asked him,  why did you wear  that little girl's skirt  with a wing?  He had wings on, right?  Yeah,  he was the Tooth Fairy. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah,  so why?  I guess he wanted  to make the money.  You wouldn't wear  a Tooth Fairy outfit  for a couple million dollars?  It's cool to do  kids movies.  Look at Ice Cube.  Who would think  a motherfucker  from Straight Outta Compton  is going to be  doing kids movies?  Exactly,  Ice Cube.  I'm not going to see  Ice Cube wearing  a skirt though.  He's pretty close.  He's not far from it.  You think so?  I mean,  what's his movie called?  Where are we...  driving his family around?  Are we there yet?  Whatever his movies are.  Like,  he's not exactly  coming straight  out of Compton.  He's America's  Most Wanted.  Yeah. 
[03:58:00]  And then he's doing  this shit.  Niggas with attitude.  From a group call.  Niggas, man.  Yeah,  no,  I don't hear that anymore  from Ice Cube.  Sometimes people realize  there's money to be made  in family entertainment.  But the difference is...  But I still wouldn't  fuck with Ice Cube.  That's what I'm saying.  Like,  he would smack me.  But The Rock was like  giving me drinks.  You know,  he gave me,  put ice in my drink  and then he fed it to me.  He didn't feed you shit.  Lying again.  You just lie.  But The Rock  could kick the shit  out of you.  Fuck him,  I'll beat his ass. 
[03:58:30]  If they knock  fucking shit out,  I could knock out  The Rock.  Who knocked you?  Fuck all that wrestling shit.  I'm jumping,  blood coming out.  I'm slicing myself  with a Gillette.  I ain't got time for that.  No, no.  Straight going in, man.  You think that's what they say?  You know how they bleed.  You see them bleed.  They get that Gillette out  and slice themselves.  Fuck that.  They still do that?  Like,  they jump around  with a little blade  and they slice themselves?  They don't really bleed anymore.  Oh, they?  Oh, shit.  It's gone very family entertainment.  They don't really bleed.  They don't do shots  to the head with chairs.  The tables.  What do you call it?  They do tables every now and then. 
[03:59:00]  The folding chairs.  Folding chairs,  but not to the head.  They'll hit you in the back  with a chair.  Wow.  Recently,  I was watching it  and there's like a hole  opened up in the ring  and then The Undertaker  came out and grabbed.  Like,  what's going on right now?  It's getting too ridiculous.  You would fuck with The Undertaker?  Come on, man.  You could fuck with The Undertaker?  I had,  who I had on the show?  Not The Undertaker.  Not The Undertaker,  but the other guy,  the one that came from The Undertaker.  What's his name?  Kane?  Kane.  I had Kane,  but he choked out PR.  See?  I wouldn't fuck with him  because he looks like a menace,  but The Rock was oiled up, 
[03:59:30]  tanned,  he was drinking.  The Rock is like an actor now.  He gave me a drink.  And he was all oiled up  and put an ice in your drink.  Bro, he was mad oiled  and he had Louis Vuitton on.  Like,  that's not gangster.  Yeah,  well,  The Rock isn't the most...  A wrestler wearing Louis Vuitton.  Yeah.  But he's an actor now.  He's Mr. Hollywood.  He's like,  you know...  Come on, man.  I just saw another movie  where he's like fighting dinosaurs  and he's going back in time.  Journey to the center of the earth.  Come on, man.  But Vin Diesel is like...  He's Vin Diesel,  you know?  Vin Diesel isn't like a tough guy anymore.  He's Mr.  You know,  I get my eyebrows waxed. 
[04:00:00]  That's The Rock.  Vin Diesel.  We don't want to talk about him,  but whatever.  What about him?  I did his birthday party one time.  Yeah?  How'd that go?  Cake, cake, cake, cake.  Yeah, there was a lot of...  There was a lot of moisture?  A lot of village people songs.  Going hard.  What?  Was he liking them?  I don't know.  Did he have his hands up  doing the YMCA and all that?  Vin swings that way?  Or was he a macho man?  Yo, man.  I don't know.  All the movies he be doing,  you know,  X, X, X. 
[04:00:30]  I don't know, man.  You saw some of that  is what you're saying.  I don't know.  I'm very cool with it, man.  But he gave me a movie  called Multifacial.  I don't know.  What does that mean?  And you didn't watch it?  He gave me a...  And it was a DVD too.  I was like,  people still have DVDs,  but he gave me a DVD  of a movie that he did.  I don't know if it ever came out,  but look it up on whatever,  Google or whatever.  It's called Multifacial.  So tell me,  explain to me what you're saying  about Vin Diesel.  He did a movie called  The Pacifier.  Okay.  What is he like to suck exactly?  Is he like a pacifier in his mouth? 
[04:01:00]  Hey, man.  He was like Mr. Nanny.  Yo, man.  The poster.  He's wearing the strap on the front  holding a kid  and one on the back  and he's carrying like a bag.  Is it gangster to do that?  No.  To prove your gangsterism?  Like you have to do those kiddie movies?  Oh, like to say like,  I'm tough enough to do a kid's movie,  but try to fuck with me.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know.  I mean,  I think I wouldn't fuck  with Ice Cube still  and he was walking around,  last time he was walking around here,  he had an afro and everything.  I wouldn't fuck with him.  Ice Cube is gangster, man.  That's niggas with attitude. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Don't fuck with the NWA.  What's that stand for?  Niggas with attitude.  Exactly.  But that ruins your cred though,  I think.  You think so?  I think so.  I mean, Ice Cube doing children's movies,  I don't want to hear that.  Yeah, but it's not like  he was actually walking around  with AKs and shit like that.  Boys in the hood, man.  Yeah.  But I mean,  he was like,  you know,  one of the most heavy  gangster rap songs ever.  Yeah, but it came out in 1991.  And not to mention,  fuck the police.  Yeah.  He made me curse a cop out, man.  What did you say to him?  I said,  fuck the police. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck you.  Police.  And then this guy in the Rock  giving me drinks, man.  So maybe the Rock's not gangster,  but like,  you wouldn't fuck with Kane.  Hell no.  You wouldn't fuck with Chris Jericho.  Hell no.  You know,  you wouldn't fuck with people  who are actually wrestling right now,  you wouldn't fuck with them.  They look like they fucking physical,  but I think it's all the act, man.  They just have oil  and they feed DJs drinks, man.  That's an actor thing.  I don't want to let you know  what the Rock was dancing to, man.  What was he dancing to?  This song called The Dougie.  He was doing The Dougie?  Everybody dances to The Dougie, though. 
[04:02:30]  Yo, man.  The Rock is not supposed to.  I got to say  every white person in America,  in corporate America,  dancing to The Dougie.  Look up The Dougie on YouTube.  Like The Rock.  Dancing to The Dougie.  Do that thing  where he fixes his hair and everything  and it comes down.  He's going in like.  Wiggling.  Like he wiggled.  It was crazy.  Troy Kwan,  people in the club,  they love The Dougie right now?  Oh, yeah.  Anytime you put that on,  teach me how to Dougie.  Do you know how to Dougie?  Yeah, I'm not going to start Dougie.  I like a little bit.  How does it go?  Can I film you right now?  Put it on fucking YouTube?  Who can't get like,  he's got 200,000 followers on Twitter. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, I can show people.  If he gets a video of you Dougie.  I'm not a good Dougie.  I'll have to practice my Dougie.  Like, how does it go?  Teach me how to Dougie.  Teach me how to Dougie.  Yo, you look fat.  Okay, how does it go, Troy?  Teach me how to Dougie.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  You look mad gay right now.  Exactly.  Well, how do you Dougie straight?  Exactly.  You Dougie straight with a girl in front of you.  That's how you do it.  Or a guy, I guess.  I don't know.  It is fucking terms.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Who, kid? 
[04:03:30]  You know, though,  you put this song on,  bitches go wild.  Yeah, they go nuts.  But I don't know.  It's just this crazy white moisture  that just explodes in the club.  Yeah, my fiancee,  who has white moisture.  She loves the Dougie.  She loves the Dougie.  My Lord.  Where did it come from?  Who's a female, by the way,  to clear up anything  that's been said on the show so far?  Female?  Female.  I was going to say she-mail.  No, no.  I said female.  It's a weird song  for white people to accept.  Yeah, it is weird.  Why?  This is like a real, like, 
[04:04:00]  ghetto street song.  You should do a poll, like,  in your blog,  like, why do white people like the Dougie?  Well, white people just like dances.  Like the chicken dance  and the fucking electric slide.  So you put the Dougie  with the chicken dance.  It doesn't matter.  And it's a simple beat.  Like, you don't want to complicate white people.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's just, it's easy.  Anybody can move to it.  And the lyrics are just like,  everybody Dougie.  Everybody Dougie.  You can sing along to it.  You know, everybody has fun to it.  It's simple.  But I don't understand regular white people,  but corporate white people,  wedding.  Is that weddings, man?  You see corporate people 
[04:04:30]  doing the Dougie?  Corporate.  I was at a Miller party.  I was at a Pepsi party.  Everybody got their suit on.  Remember the Macarena?  So when I'm-  People love that one, too.  When I'm planning my wedding,  I gotta make-  That's very white, though.  This is like a hood hip-hop song.  Macarena never hits the hood.  When I'm planning my wedding,  I should have the DJ  make sure he's got the Dougie?  Yeah, you better have that shit, man.  Otherwise people could be like,  what the fuck is this?  If you invite like white people,  you gotta have that, man.  What was the name of that band  Ice Cube was with?  Uh, Niggas with Attitude.  And what did he make you say again?  To the police? 
[04:05:00]  Fuck the police.  That's right.  Fuck that, man.  That's the note I wanted to go out on.  Don't give me no drinks, man.  Get the fuck out of here.  The Rock, man.  The Rock, he's giving you drinks.  Get the fuck out of here, Dwayne.  You call him Dwayne?  Nah, I call him The Rock, man.  He had a little Hawaii thing, too, going on.  Yeah?  I think he had like a fucking lay or whatever.  He was wearing flowers on his neck?  I gotta keep it moving, man.  Or was it a pearl necklace?  We gotta get out of here.  There's so much stuff going on.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I'm gonna be on your show this weekend.  Of course, man. 
[04:05:30]  Because we're gonna be interviewing the Muppets.  Yeah, we got Kermit the Frog.  You should come hang out with us, man.  All right, let's do it.

Yeah, we keep it real.  Hopefully, I can kidnap you on Monday, man.  I'm doing a party with Mick Jagger.  Yeah, I'll be there.  At that rock joint.  The spot's called Double 7.
