<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily centered around St. Patrick's Day and the unfolding Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The show began with discussions about the number of "amateur drinking nights" in the US calendar, debating the inclusion of Cinco de Mayo and the night before Thanksgiving.  This segued into a discussion of space junk orbiting Earth, comparing humanity to a "galactic hoarder."  They mentioned upcoming appearances on Imus' and Hannity's shows, and briefly touched upon a video of comedian Dice Clay looking like a "pirate" while ranting about Charlie Sheen.  Celebrity gossip dominated, including rumors of Tiger Woods farting on TV, Charlie Sheen's antics, and a Pokémon creator death hoax.  A financial advisor's reassuring email amidst market turmoil was also mentioned.  

The show then delved into a confusing discussion referencing genitalia and a “Dice” segment with unclear audio.  This transitioned into a discussion of President Obama's Irish ancestry and a critical analysis of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" performance on American Idol, deemed an "apocalyptic sign."  Upcoming segments about American Idol exploitation and a weatherman inexplicably becoming a nuclear power plant expert were also teased.  A sexually suggestive Star Trek skit followed, featuring Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on Dice Clay, who was sporting an eye patch (attributed to an infection).  Audio clips were played of Dice's profane rant against Gilbert Gottfried's controversial tweet about the Japan tsunami and Charlie Sheen's behavior.  More audio played of Dice mimicking a sad, injured animal, again with profanity and sexual innuendo.

Following Dice Clay’s audio,  the hosts interviewed Steve Herman, a Voice of America reporter in Japan, who provided firsthand updates on the Fukushima nuclear crisis and its aftermath.  Herman detailed the reactor cooling efforts, the widespread damage, evacuations, and the ongoing aftershocks. The conversation touched on the challenges of reporting quickly via Twitter versus traditional media.

The show then shifted to a rejected interview with Sammy Hagar, followed by a critique of American Idol's Japan earthquake/tsunami relief efforts, specifically their delayed announcement of text donation methods.  Casey Abrams' disastrous performance of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and the judges' responses were analyzed.  A trivia game about Van Halen's "jumping the shark" moment ensued (answered as the release of *Van Halen III*).  A caller mentioned a radio station playing 24 hours of Japanese music, prompting ridicule from the hosts.  Colin King, a guest in studio, discussed his recent breakup and a subsequent TMZ photo of his ex with Jim Carrey.  The show included discussion of King's USO tour in Germany, further commentary on the Japan disaster's long-term effects, and a listen to a Japanese rock band, Dirt and Gray.

The show continued with a discussion of the Chernobyl disaster, its containment, and the risks of approaching the site.  This led to tangents about a documentary on radiation levels in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, absurd lawsuits (including a pool accident), Mythbusters (and the hosts' sexuality), *Locked Up Abroad*, and the feasibility of firing a gun underwater.  Listener calls mentioned shows filmed in Chernobyl and Love Canal, leading to a discussion on abandoned locations like Kings Park Psychiatric Center and Willowbrook State School.  A personal anecdote about drinking and driving ("road sodas") and related slang terms followed, with numerous listener calls adding to the discussion.  A comedian's late-night appearance and personal struggles were discussed.  Colin Kane, another guest, promoted his stand-up performances and social media.  Bobo, a recurring character, made a surprise studio appearance.  The show ended with further discussions of slang for drinking and driving, a mention of an upcoming Elvis segment, and St. Patrick's Day greetings.

Finally, a segment focused on the scheduling of Colin King's segment as a buffer for Opie's commute, preventing him from missing Ron and Fez due to signal loss in a tunnel.  Opie made song requests for his appearance on a show called "Mimus,"  including oddly specific word requirements like "ho," "nappy," and "headed," leading to joking and speculation. Colin King then left the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazier, the better.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck. I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  Enjoy the show.  The show.  St. Paddy's Day, huh?  That's the big news today?  Hey, it's St. Paddy's Day, don't you know? 
[00:01:30]  Time to get drunk and vomit in the streets, don't you know?  You're not a fan of the St. Paddy's Day?  Yeah, it's another one of the amateur hour kind of deals going on, you know?  People drink and get really, really obnoxiously drunk.  How many amateur nights do we have?  Or amateur days?  We certainly have New Year's.  Two, really?  New Year's and St. Paddy's.  New Year's, St. Paddy's Day are known for your drinking and your vomiting amongst people that have a hard time drinking. 
[00:02:00]  The experts stay away on those two days?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't stay away.  You know, you can have a little fun.  You watch from afar?  Yeah, you just watch and go, oh boy, that guy's drunk.  Oh, that guy can't handle it.  Oh boy, look at him.  We saw two pigs in green T-shirts.  Already?  Just wandering toward the Today Show.  Really?  And just their big, huge, absolutely XLs.  Wearing some XLs. 
[00:02:30]  Wearing some XLs.  With some St. Paddy's Day crap on them.  Did they have jeggings on?  Green jeggings?  They were dressed for St. Paddy's Day and they couldn't wait to get started.  Heading toward the Today Show.  I don't know what the hell they're doing.  I'm sure they've got some kind of festive band going on, right?  It's just going to be one of those.  Yeah, I'm sure they have an Irish band playing.  Oh, look at this.  Locally, they're playing Thin Lizzy.  The boys are back in town.  On Fox 5 here in New York.  Yeah, and then we got one of the anchors there wearing some green. 
[00:03:00]  She's got a bit of the green on.  I got green, but I always wear my green 511 pants.  I see that, dude.  So I'm always in the green.  Fuck, I don't have any green on.  No, green.  Damn.  What's wrong with ye?  What the fuck?  We're all Irish today.  I hate that whole thing.  Yeah, do you?  Are you?  Yeah.  I like when you see certain people that are like, no, you're really not Irish.  And they got the button, kiss me, I'm Irish.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  And, you know, we got a complete nuclear meltdown happening, so.  Well, they're spraying water with a helicopter into the wind, actually.  I don't think any's landing on this fucking reactor, but.  I turned off the news last night and made believe that there are no monsters in the world.  No monsters?  Did you just have to shut it off and be like, I can't.  It's kind of strange when you shut off the news.  Yeah.  It's not really that bad out.  No, it's pretty quiet.  But, man, you watch the news for an hour, you are convinced the world is ending. 
[00:04:00]  It's frightening.  Because, I mean, I think it was CNN.  I think CNN is the worst of the three right now.  I really do.  Because a lot of people say Fox News is the panicky Pete's of it.  Well, they went with earthquakes, tsunami, what do they say?  Radiation, mudslides, and now snow.  That was the headline last night.  And now snow.  Snow.  Like, it's not bad enough.  Now they have to deal with snow on top of all the other shit that happened to them. 
[00:04:30]  For the poor people that don't have homes, they're caught in the cold weather now.  The snow.  It's snowing there.  And who knows what they're going to do.  But they're still keeping their dignity and their togetherness.  It really is fascinating to see.  Well, why would you live where those people lived?  You know, eventually a tsunami was coming.  Yeah, an earthquake, tsunami, that whole thing.  Well, you know what it was also?  A lot of people think, you know, Tokyo got bowled over.  This is a pretty out there area of Japan. 
[00:05:00]  So, I don't know.  It's not like the business of manufacturing centers, things like that.  They're just afraid now of the nuclear cloud blowing over the rest of Japan if something does happen.  If the wind blows the right way, right?  The wind blows.  And can we be honest with each other?  They got these 50 guys that are staying behind.  The Fukushima 50?  The Fukushima 50, they're calling them.  That's it.  The news loves when they can put a number behind a group of people, by the way.  The Fukushima 50 are staying behind to hopefully prevent a complete meltdown. 
[00:05:30]  This just didn't help me.  It is now the Fukushima 47.  Oh, boy.  Drop it to that.  Yeah, yeah.  So, what about the Fukushima 43?  Well, they're saying these brave volunteers who will be known as heroes.  Right.  Now, I've been watching this whole Japanese culture.  And like you said, and we were talking yesterday, they're a nice culture.  Very...  And they like to take care of each other.  For country, yeah.  But I also believe that some shit goes on behind the scenes, behind closed doors. 
[00:06:00]  And I have a feeling that the Fukushima 50, I don't think a lot of those guys are actually volunteering.  Really?  You think they're being forced?  I believe so.  Into doing this?  Because who the hell would take that job?  Well, Opie, during World War II, who the hell would have taken their Zero, their Mitsubishi Zero, and tied a little headband around their head, a little rising sun, and then flew directly into the deck of an American aircraft carrier.  See, this is sort of the new kamikaze for the new millennium. 
[00:06:30]  You think?  The Fukushima 50.  So, are we going to name a car after them, like we named a car after the other ones?  The Mitsubishi?  Yeah.  They should be the Fukushima.  We actually drive around in Mitsubishi's knowing what that means?  What's wrong with us?  We're having a blowout sale on the new Fukushima's.  Come on in.  Yeah.  So you really believe they're volunteers, huh?  Well, you know, Japan has that culture where it's more for country than for individual.  They truly are like Mr. Spock, running into that fucking reactor room on the Enterprise after Khan fucking unleashed hell on them. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  And, you know, I think that's their mindset.  It's that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  Right.  Live long and prosper.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Hit the glass with your face and leave a bunch of Spock makeup on it.  Film flub.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then kind of fall down and then...  Can I see that film flub?  Like Kirk kind of go like, oh.  I need to see that film flub. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure Danny will find it.  Well, locally, they're not talking about the Fukushima 50 because they just had a story.  Fukushima 37, Opie.  Oh, it's down at 37.  We're down at Fukushima 37.  It's dropping fast.  Oh, shit.  That doesn't look as good on t-shirts.  Fukushima.  You need those balanced numbers.  You can't have the Fukushima 37 on a t-shirt.  You're going to have 50 and then have it crossed out and then 48, cross it out.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, you know, fast forward a mere two weeks, they'll have a story on the last surviving Fukushima 50. 
[00:08:00]  Fukushima 50 guy, and it'll be like, wow, they gave their all and their lives.  They said they're going to die horrible deaths for taking care of country.  Yeah.  They probably will.  It's quite a heroic move, I think.  More tragedy, though.  I didn't even know this.  They're looking...  You know who's amongst the missing?  A national treasure, Tub Girl, is missing in Japan.  She's a national treasure.  Is this a real story?  Of course not.  Oh, okay.  No, I don't know. 
[00:08:30]  I just think that would be hysterical if they had to talk about, like, oh, Tub Girl is missing.  She blows diarrhea out her ass.  She's probably be able to...  Ah, never mind.  I'm not going to try it.  I'm not going to try it.  I'm not going to try it.  It was a major bomb.  I was waiting to have it.  I stopped on that one.  Where's Tub Girl?  And I think next week they're hoping to get pre-teen panty machines.  Oh, good.  Pre-teen used panty machines up and running. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, good.  They're down.  They've been down for a while.  So they're getting on what really matters.  I know they want our money.  I know they want us all to donate.  Why not set up vending machines all over Manhattan?  The panty machines?  Panty machines and all that other weird stuff they sell over there.  With all proceeds going to Japan.  It's when he first walks up.  He straightens his little blouse out, his little shirt, and then he walks toward the glass and goes, boonk, and hits the window.  And you see makeup from his nose ends up on the window. 
[00:09:30]  Are you kidding?  Why did they leave that in the movie?  I don't know.  Who would leave a bowl of blood on the bathtub when you're trying to make it look like a murder scene?  Oops.  Something's happening.  What Star Trek movie was this?  That was Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan.  One of the better Star Trek movies that were made.  Totally saving the franchise, to tell you the truth.  Because the first one, Blue Monkey Ass, and this one, Rath of Khan, really brought it back.  They turned it around, right? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The ability to make all those other crappy Star Treks afterwards.  Yeah.  What were we saying?  Fukushima.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Fukushima.  And you were talking about Tub Girl.  They did lose a famous person, though.  Did they?  And they're barely talking about it.  Let me guess.  The chick that got shit on in a wedding dress.  Very good.  Oh, this girl, the, oh, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee,  Did they lose her?  They lost the creator of Pokemon.  No way.  Pokemon guy died. 
[00:10:30]  Get out of here.  And I'm thinking, he invented all those cards.  Didn't he have one of those cards to help him out?  He could have got his Pokemon to help him.  And if I knew a little more about Pokemon, I would actually come up with an actual car that  could have maybe helped this poor fella out.  I know, there was Pikachu.  They lost the Pokemon guy in the tsunami.  Yeah.  That's the, the only celebrity I've heard of so far that Pokemon guy.  Then again, we don't know any other celebrities that come out of Japan or still live in Japan  or we don't know much about the Japanese culture. 
[00:11:00]  The Japanese culture.  It is pretty odd.  It's like an alien thing to us.  I like the sushi.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  I think that's all I know about Japan.  What about, are there, are there little schoolgirls in schoolgirl dresses around the nuclear  power plant just covering their mouths with their hand going, cause I know that's not like,  that's a very, uh, Japanese thing.  Yeah.  A little anime.  A little anime. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.  You know, the anime people, those sick fucks, they're going to exploit this eventually.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The radiation's going to like create some guy with a giant fucking.  Giant glowing dick.  Glowing penis.  And he'll, uh.  That the little, little ya-ya girls have to take.  Ya-ya.  Ya-ya.  And then they'll unleash like a, a jism tsunami.  Sure.  They'll have like a tsunami of, of cum.  Well, and there'll be some kind of tentacle, tent, tentacle thing. 
[00:12:00]  Yes.  In the tsunami that also has to, uh, rape the little, uh.  Oh, they love the tentacle penis.  Don't get mad at us, cause we're seers, and I'm telling you, eventually they will exploit  this, the anime people.  They love it.  Those sick fucks.  Oh, yeah.  Rathacon, yeah.  It's, it's, it's shortly after, uh, after, uh, that.  He goes in, he saves the, the ship with the reactor, and then, and then they don't know  up, up on the bridge.  They still gotta battle and get the fuck out of there.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, but then they go down.  When Kirk goes downstairs, that's when the shit happens. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, look, see?  Look.  Spock's sticking his face right in the reactor.  I'm watching it.  And, uh, see, he could go to the, he could be the Fukushima one.  Why'd you make a video, man?  I know.  Spock fixing everything.  Exclusive footage of the, uh.  The Fukushima 50.  That would be good.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It writes itself.  Yes.  Nothing better than a video that writes itself.  Rathacon.  Uh, Pokemon creator Satoshi Tahihiri is alive. 
[00:13:00]  Death report was hoax.  Oh.  Vince from Bayonne, he's good.  Why would they pick him for a hoax?  So I believe Vince from Bayonne.  Wow, that was going around a lot, too, man, that he was, he was dead.  So that info that we just said is false.  Why would they pick that guy?  Because that's the only one we know.  Yeah, it kind of is.  Name someone else from, uh, from Japan that's really famous, that we all know.  That old actor guy that was in Tora, Tora, Tora, and MASH all the time?  Well, how do you get that on Twitter? 
[00:13:30]  You know that old guy from Tora, Tora, Tora?  We lost him in the tsunami?  What's his name?  Who's going to retweet that?  You know, of Ka...  Uh, uh...  Exactly.  Exactly.  Ka?  Not Kaku, Michu Kaku.  Oh, Michu Kaku, God.  Kobayashi.  Did we have the worst timing on the Michu Kaku bit, or what?  Day before...  We should have let him.  Day before we would have...  We needed the expert, we decided to fuck with him.  I know.  What horrible... 
[00:14:00]  We always have bad timing when it comes to weird stuff.  Terrible.  Mako.  His name's Mako.  Mako.  Mako is a Chinese or Japanese...  He's a Japanese guy.  Oh, here comes Spock now.  We're watching.  We're all over the place, but...  Well, why don't they clean the glass to begin with before they shot this scene?  There's a lot of fucking, uh, prints on this thing.  A lot of fingerprints.  He's like, Spock!  Spock!  And then Spock kind of gets off.  He's all fucked up.  That radiation to the face really did him in.  Yeah, he's gonna be alright, though, right?  No, no.  No, actually, they've gotta fire him out in the giant sunglasses case. 
[00:14:30]  And then when...  Onto the Genesis planet, as they said on Seinfeld.  Right.  The giant sunglasses case.  And then he comes back with the dentures?  Is that what happens?  There he comes back.  Now watch.  Watch.  Dunk.  He hits the glass.  And look at the spot it just left on.  Oh, my God.  It left his makeup spot on the glass.  Oh, my God.  Do the Trekkies talk about that for hours and hours on end?  Oh, yes, yes.  I think somebody actually got a swab of it, and it sold on eBay for $6,000.  Of course.  The actual Spock nose makeup smudge. 
[00:15:00]  Of course.  Was this a sad scene?  This was probably the saddest scene ever in Star Trek history.  No.  The needs of the many.  Outweigh the needs of the...  Outweigh the needs of the few.  Right.  Yeah.  Or the one.  See?  That's Japanese culture right there.  Mm-hmm.  See?  It's like Vulcans.  They're like Vulcans.  No.  Spock.  Oh, boy.  Old.  Friend.  Oh, boy. 
[00:15:30]  Spock.  Two grown men crying.  This was bad.  Never good.  Oh, boy.  This, believe it or not, I'm old enough to have seen this in the movie theater, by the  way.  Oh, no.  And the theater was in tears.  People bawling, crying.  Oh, boy.  Not good.  Bawling, crying.  Not good.  At the Spock-Kirk death scene.  Wow.  That's a rough one.  That is heavy duty.  But he comes back.  With his dentures?  He comes back even pre-dentures, I think.  Oh, before the denture scene in the latest Star Trek movie?  In Search for Spock. 
[00:16:00]  Danny, you asshole.  He always punches up the erotic Star Trek art.  Why are they taking a bath together?  I don't know.  Well, there's something that is, in this culture, it's erotic Star Trek art.  What do they call it?  Fan fiction?  Fan fiction.  Erotic fan fiction.  Erotic fan fiction.  Starring Kirk and Spock.  And that picture is so disturbing.  It's horrible.  It's Spock and Kirk, and they're in a bathtub together. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I see that.  They're nude in a bathtub together.  They're nude in a bathtub in space.  In space.  In space.  Like, the whole background is those, like, spacey planet-sun thing.  It's the loving look that really gets me.  It really is.  The trouble is, see...  The touching is rough.  Yes.  But the loving look is really just over the top now.  And Kirk taking the very feminine position in this illustration.  It has Spock leaning in the tub, like he's leaning against the back of the tub laying down, right?  And Kirk is obviously between his legs, also sitting down. 
[00:17:00]  But he has got his head slightly on Spock's chest, with his head turned up, looking lovingly into Spock's eyes,  which are looking down in a very manly...  He's got his arm around him.  Dominant.  Yeah.  He's like, I got you, baby.  Yeah, it's like, yeah, sweetie.  I got you right here.  We're going to bathe together in space, and I'm going to protect you.  And he's like, thank you, sweetheart.  See, Spock, really, he's really the captain of the ship.  Yes, that shows right there.  Spock's the good woman behind every man. 
[00:17:30]  Was there actual...  Was there a story behind this illustration?  Probably.  It's so disturbing.  You've got to put that up somewhere.  Yeah, that's a good one.  It's so disturbing.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  And then there's kissing ones where they're making out.  That's a good one, too.  Oh, hey, where'd it go?  Hey, damn it.  Oh, come on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, what's the matter?  They don't want you to see that one.  There's all those good Spock, Kirk, gay, good...  Look at that one.  And the black and white one, the third one, you see that with the moon?  Yeah, the moon's there. 
[00:18:00]  Look at Spock's stomach.  Spock is ripped, and he's stretching backwards, and Kirk is behind him, feeling his...  Why are they doing this?  I don't know.  Did we ever show these to Shatner when he came in?  No.  Next time.  We never put these up.  Why are they doing this?  They're making out.  Making out.  In a sketch drawing.  And this is on Vulcan.  That was during a muck time when Spock and Kirk had a fight to the death.  And instead of fighting...  And they're actually hugging and kissing instead of fighting on Vulcan. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know what it is about this that makes me laugh hysterically.  It's the funniest thing, because you can see the humor in it.  It's so out of character.  It's an easy funny.  You can see the funny in it, but it's also so disturbing, too.  It's so out of character for these two people.  Oh, God, they're making out.  I'm shirtless.  I think they're in Kirk's quarters there.  That's a pastel drawing.  Yes, yes. 
[00:19:00]  Who's drawing this, though, and then showing their friends, too?  Look what I made.  This is rules, right?  He has artistic ability, and then he's also really fucking twisted.  Really gay.  And gay, right.  He really needed to go to an art shop and pick out your medium.  That's what I'm saying.  You had to make sure the muscles are just right with his pastels.  What am I going to draw?  That's a good combo, I guess, for that guy.  I don't know.  I guess the Trekkies would be kind of upset with that.  But, hey, there's artwork for everybody.  I should have hung that over my fireplace instead of the post picture I have. 
[00:19:30]  Well, you could just go to Photo Fiddle.  Photo Fiddle.  Could you Photo Fiddle?  Look, his hand's down his pants, too, by the way.  Kirk's hand is right down the front of Spock's pants.  Oh, Jesus.  Touching pubes.  Ah, shit.  Touching the pubes.  Yeah, those straight pubes like it's hair on his head.  So, I guess the Japanese thing is under control because the anchors are wearing green today.  Yeah, for St. Paddy's Day.  I'm happy to see that everything's just fine now.  Well, they've decided to take the helicopters and they're dropping water on top of these reactors to try to cool them down. 
[00:20:00]  But, it seems all the water is blowing away before it hits the reactor.  I mean, you're just making a fool of yourself now on TV.  Oh, boy.  You got the weather girl with like one of those cheesy, what do you call it?  Like a green tiara that says Happy St. Patrick's Day on top.  Yeah.  You're on the news, you stupid fucks. 
[00:20:30]  And then the black guy.  The black guy's got one of those leprechaun hats on, the green leprechaun hats.  He's the weather guy.  Yeah.  And he's.  Omar Gaddafi is taking the opportunity.  We have CNN on now.  Yeah, we got to change our buttons, Mars, please.  I'm not a fan of the CNN for the morning thing.  No, of course not.  That's like real.  They kind of hit the real news and stuff and not enough wackiness that we've grown accustomed to.  We need to beat the shit out of the local news.  Right.  And on any given day, any given channel, there's plenty to make fun of. 
[00:21:00]  Look, his green hat is keying out.  Because it's a green screen behind him.  He's in front of the chroma key and his green hat is keyed out and you can see right through it.  It's amazing.  He didn't think that.  Magic.  Well, that was like, if I may bring up last night, I popped online testing out some equipment for the compound show.  Yeah.  And I actually had beer and I put some green food coloring drops in it and the beer disappeared. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, cool.  I was able to hold it up to my face and you could just see the background.  Very cool.  It was a lot of fun.  So I'm sure you had to do that about 10 to 12 times last night because it was so much fun.  Probably three.  Okay.  I did like three Pilsner glassfuls last night.  Nice.  Very good.  Fun with a green screen and beer.  Hey, we got that reporter checking in at 7 o'clock that we turned a lot of people on to.  Oh, really?  W.  I forgot what it is now.  Yeah, I started following him.  W7VOA, I believe, is a great one to follow as far as the news in Japan goes. 
[00:22:00]  And he got all confused because he got a shitload of followers.  And he didn't know why.  He didn't know why.  And then our listeners, thank you to you guys, pushed the info toward him and said, look, you're getting all these followers from the Opie and Anthony show.  So now we're going to get a nice phoner from him.  And Andy Levy kind of turned him on to all of us.  Yeah, we said Andy Levy was the one that pushed it forward first.  And then we took it from there.  Yeah.  And I guess he's over there, right?  Oh, yeah, man.  And knows everything that's going on before the news even hits it. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah, he does.  So that's pretty handy.  I'm going to see what he's writing.  I'll tell you what he's writing right now.  Let's see.  I saw a lot of people also stopping.  Felt a lot of data.  Is something wrong with Twitter today?  Something fucked up.  They stopped following Charlie Sheen also.  Oh, really?  Taking our lead from yesterday.  And just not a big campaign.  Not anything like that.  I just decided yesterday that I've had enough.  There's no reason I should be following him.  Right.  I just updated. 
[00:23:00]  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  This guy, Mark Smith, he's saying he's laughing hysterical at the description of the Star Trek  tub photo.  Oh, really good.  Is Supermoon today also?  We get a Supermoon?  Oh, is that happening today?  Yeah, yeah.  Supermoon is today.  I noticed driving in.  It was looking a little large.  Yeah, yeah.  We got a Supermoon today. 
[00:23:30]  Uh-oh.  I don't know what it means.  It must mean the end of the world.  Another sign of the impending apocalypse.  What is the Supermoon going to bring us?  Does anyone know?  What does Supermoon do?  I see hashtag Supermoon, so maybe I should click on that and get some information.  Yeah, get some information.  On the tweeting community.  I can't wait to see the Supermoon on Friday.  I hope it won't kill anybody.  I guess it's a moon that is very, very close to the Earth.  Oh, oh. 
[00:24:00]  So what's the gravitational pull going to do?  I thought it was just a moon that was very super.  If a large coronal mass ejection occurs this week, it could trigger another earthquake.  But that's just some guy in the UK that's saying that.  Yeah, who's he?  You can't get all your news from Twitter.  Yeah, who's he in the end?  Supermoon.  I feel Supermoon rising.  What's it do?  With the gravity?  It's closer to Earth?  Is that what it is?  Yes, it's closer to Moon.  It's a full moon.  Full moon.  That will be very close to Earth. 
[00:24:30]  So it'll be very large and bright and full.  Wow.  Nice.  That's probably cool.  I guess if you're like a fisherman, you get extra fish or some shit.  I don't fucking know.  What the hell is that about?  The fish come to the surface?  Tides and stuff.  I don't know about that tide shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, look out for Supermoon.  We got Supermoon.  And reactors melting down and earthquakes, tsunamis.  And we got this journalist that we'll be calling at 7.  Or we're calling him, I guess.  Yeah.  And yeah, I want to see what the latest is over there. 
[00:25:00]  What's real, what's not?  I don't know.  Yeah, I know.  Some people say we have nothing to worry about, or they have nothing to worry about.  And then others say, oh boy, this is as bad as it gets.  This is a worldwide catastrophe.  So where are we at?  How do you find out the real news these days?  A lot of people buying those fucking pills there.  The iodine pills?  Yes.  They're loading up their fucking thyroid.  So no radiation can get in.  You dummies.  They might as well just make that cyanide. 
[00:25:30]  Just get rid of as many people as you can right away.  The horror.  You get the panicky peats, and they get their iodine.  They're sold out, what, in California and all that?  Yeah, yeah, California.  Because, you know, that's closer.  So they're deciding.  We at least get a little test period.  We get like, hey, how are you doing, California?  If you just see, like, Lindsay Lohan walking around L.A. with clumps of hair falling out of her head.  Charlie Sheen just fucking bleeding from the ears and nose.  Then we know we got problems. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, then you should probably pop a couple of those pills.  Yeah.  But other than that, I don't see anything, really.  I'm hoping it's good, because it's killing the market.  Man, did I get destroyed yesterday.  Thank God I put in a stop-limit order before I fell asleep.  You did?  Yeah.  I put in a stop-limit order for my fucking Apple stock, and I woke up and checked it,  and I was like, hey, I don't own this anymore.  Uh-oh.  So I checked, and I had automatically, because of the stop-limit, I had punched out of it  before I really went down the shitter. 
[00:26:30]  You saved yourself some money?  Saved.  Saved.  Got out.  I'm going to make it work for me, though.  I think futures are up today.  How are you going to make it work for you?  I'll buy back in.  We have a guy that sent out his email to all his clients.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he's trying to tell us that all is well.  All is well.  All is well.  All is well.  Like Kevin Bacon in Animal House on the sidewalk.  All is well. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, everyone is running out of the Delta House there.  Yeah.  On fire, basically, and there's our guy.  All is well.  All is well.  It's like the guys on the Titanic.  Don't worry.  The ship's unsinkable.  It can't sink the Titanic.  Yeah, that's our finance guy.  Yeah.  Sending out the email yesterday to everybody.  He doesn't want anyone to panic.  I was like, don't worry.  All is well.  Don't worry.  Through these times.  Yeah, our strategy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Our strategy is a diverse portfolio, which protects us against. 
[00:27:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I should read it, actually.  Where is that fucking thing?  Because it's worth reading.  Yeah, as long as you don't say his name.  Yeah, he'll probably get mad that I'm reading this.  But you know what?  I think I deleted his stupid email already.  Like you, we at Blank, Blank, Blank have been actively following the tragedy in Japan.  Yes, actively.  And as we send thoughts and prayers to the people of this country.  Wait a minute.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  We also turn our attention to the possible impact of this disaster on the financial markets. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  While we can't predict the final outcome, and then he goes with bull type.  Because we have worked together to develop a solid investing strategy based on your long-term goals.  Right.  We believe we are all well positioned to navigate any resulting turmoil.  Any.  Right.  Any?  Any, including.  How about an entire meltdown, a radioactive cloud that encircles the globe.  Right.  And a complete crash of society as we know it.  Yeah, where's that on your spreadsheet?  Yeah, could you show me the little dot that represents my portfolio and where it is on the graph? 
[00:28:30]  Is this cool to keep reading this so far?  Am I right?  Yeah, yeah, you're all right.  Just no names of companies or people.  It's important to keep some of the following points in mind.  The destruction from the earthquake, tsunami, and ongoing nuclear incidents, and then back  to bold, occurred in a less developed and industrialized area of Japan.  That's it.  See, it's in the backwoods.  We don't got to worry about it.  Tokyo's fine.  Back to normal font.  Yeah.  You'll know when the font gets big again, by the way. 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  As a result, we believe that for the time being, there will be a less direct impact on  the U.S. economy.  I think it went to bold type.  Yes, it did.  All right.  The nuclear situation is of most concern and has created an environment of uncertainty for  many countries and markets across the world.  Yes, we've seen this.  While the short-term disruptions are a cause for concerns for Japan, the long-term economic  effects of this disaster may well be positive.  Wow.  The rebuilding process will generate employment and business activity. 
[00:29:30]  The Japanese government has taken measures to potentially limit the economic damage, and  it has traditionally been very supportive of the economy during disaster situations.  By the way, this is as far as I got in the email.  It goes on and on and on.  He's trying to calm anyone's worries.  Meanwhile, we don't believe the U.S. economy.  You know who my financial guy is?  Keeps going on and on. 
[00:30:00]  My financial guy?  Yeah.  Dr. Old Bill Deal.  Oh, nice.  Down in Northwest Federal.  How's he doing?  Old Bill Deal.  Dr. Old Bill Deal.  How's Mr. Deal doing?  Bill Deal's doing good.  He's doing all right, huh?  Yeah, but you could ask him for a loan.  And what happens then?  Then he might give you a loan.  Yeah.  But he probably won't.  It's my deal here, see?  See?  By the way, someone wants to add another amateur night.  What?  Another amateur night.  We decide New Year's Eve. 
[00:30:30]  New Year's Eve.  Amateur drinking night.  St. Paddy's Day is certainly an amateur drinking day.  Mm-hmm.  And one more.  What do you think?  Nerd 05.  Oh, no.  He goes with Billy Chloe, it looks like.  CLO.  Fourth?  Fourth of July could be added as well.  Fourth of July is a very, like, but that isn't a hundred.  A holiday that's just known for drinking.  Like, number one thing with New Year's Eve is you drink.  Yeah.  St. Paddy's Day, please. 
[00:31:00]  Number one thing.  You want to guess?  I know.  Big day.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hit it.  Yeah, yeah.  Day before Thanksgiving.  You got it, Danny.  Give him a beer.  Day before Thanksgiving.  I think you might have to add that to the amateur drinking list.  I think you might have to do it.  Is that a holiday, though?  Yeah.  Well, everybody is obviously in town or out of town for their Thanksgiving din-dins.  Yeah.  And I think they just want to escape the family knowing that the dinner's the next day.  Next day.  It's like everyone goes out.  It's like everyone's off. 
[00:31:30]  Like where your local shitty swill bar has a line out the door and they're charging a  cover.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I usually, that's the night I usually hit the strip club.  I usually go to, like, the carousel out there in Huntington.  I go there the day before Thanksgiving.  Because it's cool.  There are a lot of people there.  They put on their top-of-the-line Long Island strippers.  Festive.  You know, not too scarred up.  What do they do to, you know, jazz it up?  Oh, the girls.  Make it festive.  The girls, they wear, like, green thongs and they wear a little green, funny St. Paddy's 
[00:32:00]  hat.  No, that's St. Paddy's day.  But Thanksgiving, they make sure their little turkey necks are showing.  Their little turkey neck.  They put on...  You know what they do?  They put those little paper frilly things on their ankles, get on the floor and spread  themselves open so you can look like you're stuffing them.  You can actually pull giblets out of their pussy.  Honestly, it's a fun, fun time.  It's wonderfully festive.  Giblets. 
[00:32:30]  It really gets everyone in the mood.  You've got to really reach in for the neck to pull that turkey neck out.  That would be some disgusting contest.  Giblets.  Whoever finds the giblets gets free lap bears.  Bag of giblets.  I'm sure there's someone somewhere doing exactly that.  Don't doubt it.  That's twisted, man.  Yeah.  Can we do a contest here?  I would love to.  Come on.  Next Thanksgiving.  Get to work on it now so we might be able to do it.  We want to pull giblets out of a girl's pussy.  Anything?  Anything?  Anything? 
[00:33:00]  Insertion?  Bodly fluids?  What do we got?  It's not insertion.  It's taking...  If they show up with the giblets in them, we're pulling them out.  It's not insertion.  We don't have any.  I think we have a loophole.  We don't have anyone here to ask, so...  Of course not.  Hey, they want to add Cinco de Mayo to the amateur drinking night list.  Look, we're talking about America here.  Yeah, I don't...  We're talking about America.  I don't think it makes the cut.  Although, in the last few years, they've seemed to really make a push to make Cinco de Mayo a little bigger, but...  It's not happening.  Why?  It's not really happening. 
[00:33:30]  I'm not running to the bar on May 5th.  Nah.  Yeah, I never think of Cinco de Mayo.  And the night before Thanksgiving just makes it.  Because it's not really a holiday.  You know why?  There's definitely a drop-off between St. Paddy's Day, New Year's Eve, and the night before Thanksgiving.  The difference between the night before Thanksgiving and Cinco de Mayo is that Cinco de Mayo can happen, and you won't even notice.  Yes.  No one even gives a fuck.  But if you're out and about on Thanksgiving Eve, it's unavoidable.  It's just unavoidable.  Bars are packed.  It's packed.  Traffic is everywhere. 
[00:34:00]  You know something is going on.  Yeah.  Before that, you've got to put 4th of July on that list.  4th of July is...  Before Cinco de Mayo.  That's like your barbecue outside.  I think you've got to add that to the average of drinking.  You're drinking.  You're watching fireworks.  I think drinking is a part of 4th of July.  Yeah.  I think we got it then.  Yeah.  The night before Thanksgiving, 4th of July, New Year's Eve, and of course today, St. Paddy's Day.  St. Paddy's Day being the premier drinking thing.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Because it's all it's about.  Right.  It's all it's about.  Like 4th of July, it's about Independence Day, fireworks, barbecues. 
[00:34:30]  New Year's Eve, it's New Year's Eve.  So it's about, you know, hanging out and celebrating New Year's Eve with drinking.  St. Paddy's Day is just about drinking.  And Boston, sorry, but that's just for Boston.  Marathon Day in Boston is a big drinking day.  Oh, stop.  We remember that.  Boston is.  But Marathon Day is ridiculous.  Yeah.  But the problem is that's localized.  Yeah.  We're trying to talk about the good old United States of America.  Right.  The entire country.  The entire country and what they're celebrating and drinking over and all that, bro. 
[00:35:00]  I hate that whole Cinco de Mayo thing.  Tiger farted on TV.  Tiger Woods?  Did he?  Did Tiger fart on TV?  Is this?  He was on Fallon, right?  Yes, he was as well.  But he was also at some golf thing.  And someone made a sound.  Is this all a little older?  No, no.  Oh, it's a new one?  Yeah, it's a brand new one.  Oh, okay.  Because I remember that one.  You want to play a...  You know what?  Hang on.  Give me two seconds.  Let me pull up the visual here because you can see Tiger.  Does he make a face?  Well, no, no. 
[00:35:30]  Because it's almost from the back.  They're watching someone else tee off.  Uh-huh.  But they giggle.  Like their shoulders are going like crazy.  Him and his cat.  So whereas a lot of times when there's like, oh, fart on TV, I'm like, it's probably just  some sound.  But I really do try to think...  But the reaction is, uh...  Yeah, I really think that they totally farted.  No, someone farted.  Someone blasted one.  All right.  It must have smelt like his golf game does lately.  Like shit.  Get it?  Oh, boy.  See, because he...  He is not...  He's not happening anymore.  No.  You think he'll ever fucking come back from this? 
[00:36:00]  He will win a few more tournaments.  But he never regains the...  No, not even close.  He never regains...  No, it's over.  It's over as far as him being as dominant as he has been.  Wow.  Because you've got all these young fucking guys coming up that are real good.  From his...  Real good.  ...school of thought on golf.  Oh, yeah.  Working out.  Guys that work out and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really have studied, you know, their clubs and...  He did change, you know, the way golfers are... 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  ...play golf and are perceived.  When he came...  It's always just fat, dumpy guys.  Yeah, with little beer bellies and stuff.  When Tiger Woods came on, the CNN was jacked.  Like, you know why I could drive this ball?  Because I fucking work out.  Yeah.  And these guys are like, well, I chose...  I wasn't an athlete.  I didn't think we had to.  Yeah, I didn't think I had to work out.  I walked the course.  It was not enough.  You know, further, whatever.  Yeah.  So, and now you got all these young guys that are...  That kind of followed in his footsteps. 
[00:37:00]  So, now it makes it tougher for him.  Wow.  Yeah.  Plus, he just never recovered from getting a four-iron to the side of the head.  Yeah, that shit.  But let's make believe that didn't happen.  Because we weren't there, so we don't know.  We don't know.  She was helping him out of the vehicle.  Come on.  Something.  She was helping him out of the vehicle by breaking the glass.  We'll never get the real story there.  Nope.  She ain't gonna talk.  He's not talking.  And by the time the neighbors showed up, they didn't know what happened.  Yeah.  Only two people could tell that real story, and they're both not talking. 
[00:37:30]  I just saw something fantastic on the news.  NASA to zap space junk.  They just showed a map of the globe, of the Earth, and a graphic of how much space junk is floating around it.  It is packed up there.  There is so much shit up in space.  And they're going to start using a laser to try to zap this shit and maybe get it away.  What are we doing?  Look at those pictures.  What are we doing as humans? 
[00:38:00]  That's all the shit that's floating around in space.  That's a picture of the junk?  Look at all the junk in space.  We just suck as fucking humans.  Oh my God.  Is that real or is that photoshopped?  Well, that's, no, that's, that's, it's, it's a graphic.  It's, it's obviously these things are not to scale, but there's that much shit floating around.  All around the Earth.  Where do people go to see this one, Danny?  That's fucked up.  Well, I mean, there's a ton of different ones.  If anyone just wants to Google, like, you know, space junk map. 
[00:38:30]  Okay, yeah, then you can see it for yourself.  Yeah, there's a lot of these out there.  Just go to meat spin, guys, and you'll be able to find it.  Why did we decide that's a good idea, to just fucking leave our junk in our orbit?  I think it got, I think we got to the point where it was like, all right, we're going  to space, it's so fucking cool that we won't worry about the junk.  How much junk are there going to be?  How many times are we really going to do this?  And then they just kept doing it, and it was like, wow, now we got a lot of junk up  here.  Do you think, if there's life elsewhere, they gotta be looking at this like, look at these  idiots.  Fucking, you know what we are?  Look at these idiots.  You know what we are? 
[00:39:00]  When you look at that house that has like all the shit in the yard, and just like they  don't keep the fucking lawn nice, the white trash of the universe.  We are the complete white trash hoarders.  We're hoarders.  Oh no, we're fucking galactic hoarders.  We're galactic hoarders.  Look at this picture.  That's a hoarding picture.  I need that satellite.  Right.  I need it.  Now look, what would you do if I just take away one satellite from you?  You're in power.  All right, everybody, look, we're not gonna screw around with anything. 
[00:39:30]  We have to get permission before we throw away any of these booster rockets.  Now, do you really need the booster rocket from an old Titan?  I got this when my mother died.  All right, keep it.  Fuck this.  Oh, here comes the sister.  Right.  She's mad.  Right.  We are hoarded.  We're a fucking galactic hoarder.  We're hoarding around our own planet.  We gotta look ridiculous to the rest of the lifeforms out there.  They don't clean their shit up. 
[00:40:00]  They're looking in their telescopes.  Oh my God.  Is that an actual photo?  That's another just kind of a graphic.  It's like when you see how many planes are in the air over the United States at any given moment.  You know what it looks like is that, uh, oh fuck, help me out.  Yeah, when you make the face with the magnet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  On the guy, Wooly.  What is it?  Wooly-Willy.  Yeah, I think that's it.  Wooly-Willy.  It looks like that much shit is around the Earth.  Like, they just took all the wooly shit, the metal shavings, and made a circle.  Yes.  You can't distinguish individual dots at some point.  I noticed that the poles have a little more. 
[00:40:30]  I wonder what that's about.  How does that work?  Polar orbits.  Polar orbits.  Synchronous orbits around the poles.  Yeah, geosynchronous orbits.  Sirius XM has some geosynchronous orbits.  Yes.  So, Sirius XM's satellite is up there hoping that none of this shit packs its way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  XM's satellites are geosynchronous, and Sirius satellites are not.  They perform some kind of a figure eight.  There's three satellites, and two are on at any given moment, and one goes to sleep when  it's over South America. 
[00:41:00]  And then it comes back in a figure eight as the other one drops down, and then those two  are awake while the other one's asleep.  And it continuously does this figure eight pattern, one slinging over South America and  powering down.  I thought Sirius, their satellites just orbit around Howard Stern's head.  Because it seems like that's the only thing they care about.  That's the center of the universe.  That's the center of the universe, according to Sirius.  And no one get angry, shut up, we're fucking having fun here. 
[00:41:30]  If you walk around these halls, you would not know that there's something else going on  besides Howard.  The center of the universe.  Yeah, their satellites revolve around Howard.  Good for him.  Trust me, it does.  Good for him.  And that's not a slam on anyone, fuckers.  Take it.  I thought these satellites did.  Enjoy that little fucking dig.  Like small, if any, like thrusters.  Can't they just blast out of the orbit?  I don't think so, no.  Escape velocity is like fucking crazy.  They're not made to escape.  You need like 25,000 miles per hour to get away from the Earth, and those things are just 
[00:42:00]  made for maneuvering.  How are we going to zap this shit?  I guess they're hitting them with lasers.  And then what happens?  I don't think it destroys them.  Does it make them smaller?  I don't know what the thing is.  I've heard things that lasers can do where if you hit something in space with a laser,  it will start to vaporize the surface of what you're hitting.  And from that vapor, it does make a slight thrust, which can push it away. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I see.  But again, I don't think you're reaching escape velocity with that.  That's a lot of shit they've got to fucking zap.  Yeah, they must be experimenting.  Like, they're not doing it now.  Are we going to have garbage men in space?  We should.  That shit will just all come fucking falling through the atmosphere and burn up.  But some of this stuff is so heavy that it doesn't burn up.  Right.  Some has nuclear fucking shit in it.  Oh, that's great.  A lot of it hits the ocean because the ocean is like 75% of the earth.  And other ones have hit in Australia, just the outback.  We've been very lucky where they just kind of hit places where no one lives. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, we're just going to poison ourselves.  Yeah, we're going to kill ourselves on this planet.  I think the life expectancy is going to start going back down.  Yeah, yeah.  And then it's going to get to a point where humans don't live enough to have real intelligence.  So it would just be dummies for 20 years.  So then we can't keep anything going anymore.  Like the life expectancy is going to be like 8.  Life expectancy highest ever in the United States.  I know it is.  That means it's about ready to start moving the other way.  We're ready to go the other way.  We just become so stupid we can't fix anything. 
[00:43:30]  As we continue to poison ourselves, what do you think is going to happen?  I love the idea that there are people out there still saying save the planet when what they mean is save us.  Because what we're doing to the planet is nothing.  We're not hurting the planet.  No, because we will look at it with our own minds.  The fact is the planet could wait like 10,000 years for all the radioactivity, whatever, to go away.  They don't care.  The planet doesn't care.  It'll keep spinning.  We'll wait 10,000 times. 
[00:44:00]  That's a blink of the eye.  It's nothing to the Earth.  Nah.  No, people think like, well, what about our children and our children's children?  Oh, wow.  You're going that far in the future?  Whoa, look out.  I'm just hoping to get past next year.  Yeah, fuck it.  How about that?  I'm hoping the planet gets past next year with this 2112 shit.  And you know this stuff was supposed to start before 2112.  Yeah.  Is this the start of the 2112 shit?  2112?  Or 2012?  I mean 2012.  Sorry.  I thought you were sorry.  You're going to stay alive for another 100 years? 
[00:44:30]  Okay, and I don't want to.  I have no desire to do that.  2012, though.  2012.  Is this the start of the 2012 shit?  It is suspicious, but I think...  Because you don't just wait for 2012 and then the shit happens.  It has to start building.  But if you look at...  Let's look at what was going on during Chernobyl.  Were people going like, uh, end of the world?  Oh, look.  Oh, boy.  No, because it was Russia.  Yeah?  Yeah, this is Japan.  This is...  About Three Mile Island where it's like, oh, boy, end of the world.  Look what we're doing.  They look different. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  But we can relate to Japan more than we did Russia.  Yeah, Russians were just scary black and white people.  They were.  Black and white grainy film people.  Yeah, that's so weird.  They were still living in black and white as we were living in...  Yeah, we were in living color.  Living color.  And why were they still living in the black and white world?  And they were in black and white.  I don't understand that.  Still in a little bit of fast motion.  Yeah, a little fast motion still.  A little slow crank going on with the camera.  Yeah, I don't understand that.  A little fast motion.  And everything was just gray and dark and dingy.  Until they had their May Day Parade. 
[00:45:30]  And then you'd see all those red commie flags.  But everything else is just drab green and grays.  When did they start living in color?  In living color.  I think when American Blue Jeans went over there for the first time.  And they saw blue.  I think when we knocked that wall down.  That wall down?  I think it was before that.  You think before the wall got knocked down...  Yeah, it was like glasnost.  I think when Poland started getting uppity.  Then the color appeared.  Yeah, and the color started appearing.  When satellite dishes came out.  When the Ruskies could pick up some of our own television. 
[00:46:00]  And the state-run TV stations couldn't do anything about it.  And they were able to see, like, wow, people are partying.  Look at them.  They're doing the pogo to fucking punk rock.  I'd like to do that.  All right.  Hey, we got a great little piece to play into the break today.  We go back to the Star Trek thing.  Oh, great.  This is something we used to play.  Really?  I forgot about this.  I want to thank E-Rock for this pickup.  I'm surprised.  I don't know what this is. 
[00:46:30]  You'll remember this one.  I forgot all about this.  But, man, you brought it up today.  So we go old school for everyone.  We're taking it back.  What do we got today?  I think we got a really busy show.  Yeah.  Let me see what we got.  Busy show.  Busy after show.  We got a lot going on today.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing Imus' show today?  Not Imus.  That's later, right?  Kiss me, I'm Imus.  Kiss me, I'm Imus.  He's doing a kiss me, I'm Imus.  Special tonight at 6 p.m. at the Hard Rock.  And we're being interviewed for it?  Yeah, we're going to sit in with him for a little bit.  Have a little chit-chat with him. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Hannity.  All right.  And then I do Hannity tonight.  Nice.  So tune in, please.  Very good.  We'll talk about how Obama isn't doing the right things.  You know.  We'll just talk about how Obama is dropping the ball on every front.  I cringed today because I'm like, oh, this just gave Anthony fodder with his Obama thing.  You know that there, and maybe we could get the news story for after the break.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a couple things you need to get for after the break. 
[00:47:30]  Fucking Dice went off on Charlie Sheen.  Did he?  And it was a weird little video that, I don't know.  Where did he put it?  It was one of the papers in New York.  I guess they now do their little, they're doing little interviews and stuff, which is  kind of smart for a newspaper.  Wow.  And someone tweeted to me.  It's literally my last tweet last night, OP Radio.  But we got to get the actual audio if they can get it down the hall.  Because they asked him about Gilbert Gottfried. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Had a few little things to say, and then he went off on Charlie Sheen.  I got to hear this.  And the best part about it, because we'll watch the video, we have to do the radio part  for the people.  Dice has a, looks like a pirate now.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  He looks like a pirate.  What's he doing?  Ah, matey.  I mean.  A best.  Let's save it for after the break, because we're going to want to spend time with this.  But Dice now looks like a pirate, and he's going off on Charlie Sheen.  It was great.  It was great. 
[00:48:30]  So we got that.  I'm looking for the black pearl.  Yeah.  And what was the other fucking thing I needed?  Come on.  See that?  There you go.  What's wrong with Dice?  I don't know.  Is something wrong with his eye?  And for the people that don't follow me on Twitter, I gave it away last night.  The secret weapon yesterday was Dice.  Was Dice, yeah.  He was on hold as we were talking to Ian and his whores.  I'm not waiting.  And those stupid bitches wouldn't shut the fuck up so we could just, you know, get Dice involved. 
[00:49:00]  I don't wait.  So he gave up on us.  For the likes of these people.  He gave up on us.  There was something else I wanted those guys to pull.  Fuck, I can't remember now.  What was I just talking about?  Their puds?  Yeah, pull your puds.  Get the Dice thing.  I can do that.  What the fuck were we just talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  The first thing, before the Dice, was the sound to pull of the thing.  Fuck me.  Look at the attention span here.  It's fantastic.  Oh, it's so bad.  But no one else can help us?  I'm looking down and seeing if somebody can pop it up. 
[00:49:30]  Because maybe I didn't even start with the hints yet, right?  Fuck.  Obama.  Oh, Obama.  Thank you.  Very good.  That goes to Anthony91.  Thank you.  Anthony91 is a true hero and should be part of the Fukushima...  26, it's down to.  Is it Fukushima?  The Fukushima 26 now.  It was 50, but they're just...  But add Anthony to the Fukushima fucking 50, man.  Because he's a hero today, truly.  Fukushima 50.  I heard this on the way in, and I'm like, oh my God, this is fodder for Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know if I want to deal with this.  And maybe I shouldn't even bring it up, because now I'm doing it to myself.  Wait a minute.  But they have discovered, and please pull the story...  Oh, don't even tell me.  I know this, and I was thinking about it.  Obama is part Irish.  Right.  They have discovered that Obama...  They look back in his past, his ancestry, and yes, President Obama is part Irish, so 
[00:50:30]  he will be celebrating St. Paddy's Day a little more than usual.  With his Irish background?  Yes.  Yeah.  Can you pull that story?  Good for him.  Good for him.  Do you have to fucking connect to everything?  He's a little bit of everything, isn't he?  And we got Smells Like Teen Spirit being performed on American Idol.  That's a sign of the apocalypse, and that the world is indeed ending.  You don't need to go any further than that.  Wow.  That's a shame.  Oh, and the teasing that American Idol did that Sammy brought to my attention. 
[00:51:00]  Shame.  We got a lot of fucking dirt bags.  We got a lot to explain after the break, ladies and gentlemen.  A little exploitation going on?  We're going to do the dice.  We're going to do the American Idol exploitation.  We're going to do the Teen Spirit thing.  And you've got to get the weather guy becoming a nuclear power plant expert.  I'm telling you, I'm not giving up on that bit.  Guy usually just talks about hurricanes and bullshit, and next thing you know...  He's an expert.  He's an expert, and he's telling everybody about what's going on in Japan.  Well, all I know is Irishman got to eat.  Yeah, let's do this. 
[00:51:30]  Going old school because you brought up to Star Trek.  Here it is.  Space.  The final frontier.  Specimen gathering mission on planet Alpha 177.  Mr. Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.  Aroused, his great physical strength could kill him.  But it's a risk I'll have to take.  Something bothering you, Mr. Spock?  May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans. 
[00:52:00]  I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.  Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions.  Love.  Tenderness.  Yes.  If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain,  I understand.  It's the way I am.  Don't be afraid.  Here's my hand.  Hold on.  You are beautiful.  More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known. 
[00:52:30]  What is your point, Mr. Spock?  I love you.  I can love you.  Kiss me.  You're out of your mind.  The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.  You don't really want to hurt me, do you?  Put that thing away.  No, I don't think so.  No!  I can't!  It's painless and quick.  Entry made by second officer Spock. 
[00:53:00]  Possible we may have hit the wrong entry point.  Yes.  Very well, Captain.  Try again.  It pleases you.  What are you waiting for?  Hurry!  If you'll excuse the intrusion, Captain.  Bury the hatchet.  Inappropriate choice of terms, Captain.  Keep your Vulcan hands off.  Just keep away, you green-blooded half-green.  Scotty.  No, wait.  Are you all right, Captain?  All right. 
[00:53:30]  I'm just going to be busy.  I have to take him back.  Inside myself.  I can't survive without him.  I don't want to take him back.  He's like an animal.  A thoughtless, brutal animal.  Let me get your hands.  The virus.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  It's the end of the world as we know it.  It's the end of the world as we know it. 
[00:54:00]  It's the end of the world as we know it.  And I feel fine.  Yeah, I feel fine.  A lot of Rush fans checking in, Ant.  Because I said 21-12 instead of 2012.  Oh.  And they're saying the year of Rush.  It's going to suck for Rush when they're not around when their big year comes around.  Their big year.  Yeah.  They'll play it, though.  Somebody will play it.  Someone in the future.  They'll be playing in their flying car, I bet.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Because that's going to happen.  Yeah, that's absolutely going to happen.  Oh, yeah.  We're winning.  The year of Rush, 21-12.  Very good for the Rush people out there.  You want to watch this Dice thing?  I live for it.  So, thanks to the guy that tweeted it.  I gave you credit on Twitter yesterday.  I can't find you right now.  Where?  Like, did Dice?  They just ran into him.  They ran into him?  Yeah, somewhere.  Somewhere.  Yeah, man.  And just asked him to comment.  What is he?  What is that on his face? 
[00:55:00]  It's an eye patch.  It's an eye patch.  He's either a pirate or somebody poked him in the eye.  Does he have, like, a bum eye now or something?  I don't know.  I don't know what this is about.  I'm a pirate.  It might just be him.  Him being, like, crazy?  Yeah, like, I'm going to walk around like this for a while.  This is my thing.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to go out with an eye patch on.  Just to screw people.  A vest, matey. 
[00:55:30]  Fire cannons.  Oh!  I'll get ye.  He's got an eye patch.  Oh!  Raise the jolly roger.  I got the jolliest roger ever.  Look, the cannonball, it's over here now.  I'm going to launch it over there.  Over there.  But it's over here now. 
[00:56:00]  Uh-huh.  You hear?  Uh-huh.  You hear me?  Uh-huh.  I want the cannons to all go, uh-guish, uh-guish.  Hey, what's in Davy Jones' locker?  Let's check.  Who's this Davy Jones?  Why would one of the monkeys have some in a locker at the bottom of the ocean?  It's stupid.  Where's my parrot?  Hey, I need my parrot for my shoulder.  And my peg leg. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, some chick was like,  Oh, Dice, fuck me with your peg leg.  I was like, shut up, you whore.  Fucking Dice.  I'm a pirate.  Why is he a pirate?  I got a puffy shirt.  I don't want to be a pirate.  Why is he a pirate?  What is he doing?  I don't know, but he has a patch on his eye.  He's a madman.  Fucking Dice. 
[00:57:00]  You think he's walking around with some of those doubloons?  Uh, some gold doubloons.  Doubloons?  How much for the sweatshirt?  No, no, I'll give you four doubloons.  I ain't paying five doubloons.  You hear?  I hear me.  He hears himself, which is nice.  What is this?  Uh, pieces of eight?  I got some pieces of five I'll pay.  No eight for you. 
[00:57:30]  Do you remember the time we pillaged your ship?  Do you remember?  Look at my hat.  I got a pirate hat.  The hat.  Yeah, why isn't he wearing a hat?  He loves hats.  He should wear the hat with a feather.  And is he trying to be a Somalian pirate or a regular pirate?  Old school pirate.  Old school.  Oh, okay.  I don't like the other ones.  I'll get that chick. 
[00:58:00]  After I bang her, I make her walk the plank.  You're a dirty whore.  Oh, my pirate.  That's great pirate-y music.  I like that.  Let's see what Dice is doing, though, with this patch on his eye.  I got to know what the fuck this is all about.  So they ran into Dice and asked him about who?  Gilbert.  Gilbert.  But then he really turned his attention to hating Twitter and Charlie Sheen.  Okay.  Let's give a listen. 
[00:58:30]  Your one-stop show.  Commercial.  That's good.  Of course.  Banan and everything.  How long is this commercial, though?  It's going pretty fast.  Already three quarters over.  That's a 15-second one.  Yeah, it's a quickie.  We can handle 15-second commercials.  There we go.  Here it comes.  As a very controversial comedian in your day, what do you think of what Gilbert Gottfried  said that got him kicked off of Affleck?  What Gilbert Gottfried said?  I don't even know what he said. 
[00:59:00]  What did he say?  Basically, he put out a Twitter tweet about this.  I'm not a Twitter.  Yeah.  I'm not a f***ing idiot with Twitter.  He put out a tweet.  No, I don't even have a Twitter account.  You know that?  You know what I got?  My wife does it for me.  Mrs. Dice Clay.  Anybody wants to Twitter me?  Okay?  Who gives a f*** about Gilbert?  You know?  You come to me with Eddie Murphy, well, then maybe I'll have a comment.  You know what I mean?  You know?  Maybe...  What did he say?  What did he say?  Something about...  Wait.  I think something about... 
[00:59:30]  Like he made fun of the Japan thing?  The Tokyo thing?  Yeah, he made fun of the tsunami.  And he made fun of that?  Yeah.  Okay.  He said Japanese...  Forget about him.  Forget about him.  How about, well, this f*** that everybody's afraid to say anything to, this f***ing Charlie  Sheen, with all his ranting and all the attention he's getting, maybe he should say something  nice and maybe some kind words to all those people out in Tokyo and to their families while 
[01:00:00]  he's got the f***ing spotlight on him.  You know what gets me about something like that?  Nobody's got the balls to tell this guy how f***ed up he is.  He's on TV terrorizing newscasters because they've seen him waving a f***ing machete in  the air.  But he's f***ing saying, I'm winning.  Let me tell you something, Charlie.  I used to be a big fan of what you do.  You did some great movies in the past.  And you get an opportunity to be on one of the greatest sitcoms of this f***ing decade. 
[01:00:30]  And then you go on TV and promote f***ing drugs.  You call that f***ing winning when you get f***ing fired from a hit sitcom?  You call that winning?  Do you call winning when there's f***ing custody battles, your kids are being taken from you,  and you're living with two f***ing porno actresses that I could watch on YouTube, jerk my f***ing  shut on the off button, and you think you're f***ing winning, going from a hit show to a  f***ing cooking show, tossing a f***ing salad?  Get the f***ing help you need. 
[01:01:00]  Because I'm sick of watching the Charlie A** show.  Take a word of advice.  I'm not afraid to tell you.  You're f***ed up.  They do commercials about f***ing drugs all the time.  This is your brain on drugs, and then they put it in a frying pan and show the f***ing eggs  scrambling.  Now they got Charlie Sheen to look at.  You're so f***ed up, you don't even see the billboards from that f***ing show you were  doing, the one you're being a f***ing anti-Semitic guy to, to your ex-boss, whatever his name 
[01:01:30]  is, that you're doing anti-Semitic remarks.  Nobody likes that f***ing.  You're not a rock star.  You're not a comic.  You're the biggest f***ing loser in the world, as far as I'm concerned, okay?  Go get the help you f***ing need.  Nobody's on Twitter watching you going, hey, Charlie's great.  Charlie's winning.  Everybody's watching you fall, and everybody's afraid to say it to you.  Get f***ing help.  And Gilbert, I think you lost a job, didn't you? 
[01:02:00]  Maybe you need some help, too.  But why are you wearing a pirate patch on your eyes saying this?  Guys, why do you have a pirate patch?  This is not a great rant.  But the f***ing newspaper blew it, because it's the news, so you don't need the beeps.  Oh, the beeps.  I would love to hear that unedited.  I know, yeah, yeah.  But although the beeps kind of make it funny, because at one point, it's just all beeps,  yeah.  Not a bad rant by our old friend, huh? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he's been doing that for a while.  Did you see his white sideburns with the dark black?  Yeah.  It's painted, yeah.  Yeah, the white sideburns.  You can't keep up with that.  The gray hair is growing in really fast.  It's really coming in quick on the dice, man.  By the time he puts his medicine on, it's already turning gray again, or white.  I thought what he was doing was growing out the sideburn white, and then coloring it  in, and then shaving around that.  I think he's fooling around with some shit right now.  Oh, that's funny.  He's fooling around with his luck.  And I have a feeling that the patch is completely a goof. 
[01:03:00]  I'm a swashbuckler.  That's a great word, Ray.  A swashbuckler.  Maybe he's going to pick up a blunderbuss.  I need a blunderbuss so I can shoot people with my blunderbuss.  Oh, he has an eye infection.  He told his audience in Fort Lauderdale.  That's why I love having this show, man.  I came in my eye, and it got infected.  Probably.  I got conjunctivitis like the puppies in those late night commercials. 
[01:03:30]  Someone adopt me already.  Look at me.  Adopt the dice.  Please adopt the dice.  I'm in this cage with my runny eyes.  And I'm pissing on the fucking bottom of a cage.  And it's hurting me.  My little feet and hands, it hurts on the metal cage.  Look, I'm making sad eyes.  And my nose is running. 
[01:04:00]  And I'm panting.  My eye's infected.  I will remember you.  How long does it take to find the song?  I know.  I see what he's doing in there.  I'm about to pull it up on YouTube.  And I'm like, you know what?  By the time I get to it on YouTube, it's just over.  That song should be on a hot button.  We go to it a lot.  We really do need that on a hot button.  He rocks still trying to find it.  Oh, we rock.  And he goes, I got it.  It's over now.  I'm already done.  And I'm spent.  And I'm spent. 
[01:04:30]  See, it would have been like this.  Watch.  And my eye is infected.  Because could you please adopt a dice?  My eye is all crusty and red.  And it's dripping goo.  It looks like banana juice is coming out of my eye.  And when you look under this patch, can you find it in your heart to take home a dice?  I'm in a cage. 
[01:05:00]  I'm shitting myself.  I got shit on my coat.  I've been pissing all over my feet.  You gotta help me.  I need a home.  You gotta sound sad or they're not gonna adopt you.  Hey, uh, some of the broads, look at me.  Oh, I'm very sad.  My eyes are runny.  And, uh, my ass hurts from sitting on this metal cage.  So take me home, you fucking cocksucker. 
[01:05:30]  Anyone, get me out of here.  I'm behind a cage.  Look at my nose is dripping.  Look, my nose is all cold because I'm sick.  And I have an eye infection.  And this fucking cunt is singing this song.  It should tug at your heartstrings.  I'm a pirate.  Woof, woof.  Take me home, you asshole.  Come on, you fucking, you fucking jerk off face. 
[01:06:00]  Look at me.  I'm sad.  I'm very sad.  Take your own dice home.  I'll bring you your fucking slippers at night.  I'll lick your face.  Or your bugs.  Uh, nice.  That's good shit right there.  I can't get over him with the pirate.  What is he doing?  You think it's a bit?  No, a guy from, uh, where?  Uh, Miami.  Saw dice at the Fort Lauderdale Improv two weeks ago. 
[01:06:30]  He had the patch, said he had an eye infection, so.  God damn.  And someone else wrote, yo, ho, ho, in a bottle of cum.  Ah, Israel checking in.  Israel.  Israel, yes.  So.  Oh my God.  Very good.  Oh, that was good.  I liked his take on that.  I wonder if there is an unedited version somewhere.  Yeah.  Who did that, though?  Because, uh, it was on the, um.  It was in New York.  It was on the Post?  It was the New York Post.  They, you're the news.  You don't have to put beeps in it. 
[01:07:00]  But it's like, what was the Post doing?  Everyone's doing that.  Did they just wander around and.  Everyone's doing that now.  Yeah, you can't just be in newspaper.  You gotta fucking.  Yeah, I know.  You gotta, you gotta spread your shit out.  But I would think that was probably L.A., right?  Everyone's going with a video, uh, visual element except for us.  We're doing it on our own.  Yeah.  Behind the scenes shit.  Oh, yeah.  But as soon as we do film, like, our radio show, they have a problem with it for some  reason.  Well.  Even newspapers now have a visual element.  Will you, will you wake up down the hall, please, and get us a visual element so these 
[01:07:30]  people could see shit as they're listening to this?  Yeah, they, they should.  But I do have that on my Twitter if you want to check it out.  OP Radio.  Twitter.  The dice with the eyepatch.  Hey, we gotta get that, uh, reporter on.  Oh, right.  W-7-V-O-A.  It's like 8.30 at night in Japan, I think.  What's his real name?  Uh, Steve Herman.  We got it there.  Yeah, that's it.  Steve Herman.  Herman.  He's given some great info on Twitter, W-7-V-O-A.  And once again, I want to thank Andy Levy. 
[01:08:00]  He was the one that turned us on to this.  Oh, yeah.  Andy Levy's a great one to follow as far as news goes.  And actually, not actually.  He's a rip.  And he's also a funny guy.  Yeah, very funny.  So it's a nice combo when you, when you follow him.  A bunch of happy St. Pat's thing.  Huh?  A bunch of happy St. Pat's coming in on the, uh, tweet.  On the tweeter, as they say.  All right.  Hmm.  Yeah, so we're going to talk to that guy.  Yeah, they're just calling him right now.  He's got the inside, uh, scoop.  We're just trying to...  He tweeted that he was going to be on our show. 
[01:08:30]  He did?  Yeah.  That's nice of him.  All the news you need to know from, uh, Japan.  And I hear he's there.  I hear he does work for CNN or something.  Yeah.  International, I think.  So then why is he getting info before CNN?  Because he's there.  So he probably, like, gives it to him.  He's probably the guy with the info.  And he tweets it as he's doing it.  And then they, uh, they pick it up.  Yeah, the news organizations, they're still behind when it comes to Twitter.  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  Yeah, I think they're trying to catch up. 
[01:09:00]  So many times we tweet shit before...  Before the news.  ...the big news, uh, Twitter accounts.  I read stuff on Twitter before it actually hits the news.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All the time.  Like, you could get your news now, at least a headline, uh, from, from Twitter or other  places on the internet.  Is it just ringing?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh, E-Rock's talking.  Was that on the air or just in our ears?  I think it was just in your ear.  Oh.  Yeah.  You can talk on the air sometimes, E-Rock. 
[01:09:30]  They're ringing.  Not now.  No, now it's too late.  Because we already got the info.  He just tortured a poor fellow.  By the way, there is something happening because at E-Rock, uh, Justin Stengel, who  is one of the head writers at, uh, Letterman.  Oh, yeah.  Who's, uh, uh, certainly a friend of mine and a friend of the show.  Oh, yeah.  He, he thought it was the funniest fucking thing when I brought up the whole, are you  watching the news with E-Rock?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And now people are just randomly just, uh, tweeting, are you watching the news?  Yeah, I got that.  Justin did one this morning. 
[01:10:00]  I just did one.  I got that text yesterday.  He goes, it was the funniest fucking thing because we all know people that do it.  Do that to us.  Watching the news?  Watching the news.  It's like, why?  You should never get a text that just says, are you watching the news?  Yeah.  I, well, I, I got a text yesterday from you.  Oh, I did it to you.  You're watching the news?  I did it to you.  Okay.  I forgot.  Yeah.  What the fuck, man?  You were in on the bed, right?  I, I know.  Okay.  I was like, yeah, what the fuck?  Okay.  It's just, just so you guys can understand how ridiculous it is. 
[01:10:30]  And then E-Rock gets mad at me.  Are you watching the news?  How, how about, you, you, you, you got a few more letters to use.  You have 140 characters.  Yeah.  Watching the news.  A little quickie on what I'm supposed to be watching on the news.  Of course.  Or what's so amazing.  But it's, it's bubbling on Twitter now.  People are just kind of randomly.  Watching the news.  Tweeting that here and there.  Let's say hi to Steve Herman, live from Japan.  Mr. Herman, how are you, sir?  I'm terrified.  All right, not, not from a tsunami, earthquakes, or nuclear radiation, but I've, I've heard 
[01:11:00]  about you guys.  Oh, no, we're, we're saints.  I would say only believe 33% of what you hear.  That's true.  And that, and I'm not even joking.  We're not all relaxed.  Unfortunately, unfortunately, the media only grabs on one thing we do, the, the shock jock  thing, which we do very well when we need to, but we're also very, very intelligent  guys.  We have a bad rep.  We sure do.  Yeah.  And we're, and we're seers.  We're, we're, we're modern day seers. 
[01:11:30]  We come up with stuff way before it actually happens.  We're like that girl in school that, um, uh, may have, uh, been a little sexually active  with one person, but then, uh, the whole school thinks she's a slut.  Right.  That's pretty much what we are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get the drift.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a real newsman.  I know.  We don't want to lose him before we start.  Well, I just wanted to give him that whole thing.  I could have gone much more detail with that, uh, little analogy, but I, I kept  it nice.  He certainly held back on, uh, held back on that way.  Yes, sir.  So, uh, Steve Herman, just a little history.  Uh, we got this guy, Andy Levy.  I don't know if you know him personally, but he was the one that pretty much told a lot 
[01:12:00]  of people to follow you.  W-7 VOA on Twitter.  And I certainly, I certainly went there and I started noticing right away, wow, this guy  has news way before I'm seeing it on my TV.  Yeah.  Well, uh.  Not too hard these days, but, uh.  Yeah, we were just discussing that, uh, it seems a lot of these, um, news outlets are  way behind, especially on Twitter, especially on Twitter getting, uh, the news out.  Well, I think, uh, part of it is, is, uh, news networks in the United States don't have 
[01:12:30]  a lot of people post it in many places anymore.  And also there is a journalistic need, of course, to, to verify something before you  put it on the air.  It's, uh, it's much easier to, uh, uh, write a hundred and, uh, you know, a tweet, uh, than  it is to, uh, go through the entire process of getting a story on the air.  So I do empathize with them because I also do the, the traditional media thing too.  And it can take hours to get something, um, uh, on our air or on our website as well. 
[01:13:00]  And that's the wonderful thing about Twitter, uh, it's, it is an early warning system.  And, uh, yeah, I get a lot of my first, uh, the first things I, I hear about are, are usually  on Twitter.  And then you go to the news for the details of what happened, but you've been, uh, you've  been really active and, and letting people know, uh, kind of what's going on over there  in, in Japan.  Yeah.  Well, one last thing just to set it up.  Uh, who, who do you work for, Steve?  I am the Northeast Asia Bureau Chief of the Voice of America. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  And, uh, VOA is, uh, paid for with your tax dollars, but we are an external broadcaster.  We are forbidden actually under the Smith-Mount Act from broadcasting to the United States.  Wow.  And what, what is the, just out of curiosity, what is the reasoning behind that by the way?  Uh, there's a bit of history, uh, when VOA was set up during World War II, uh, apparently  there were members of Congress that were nervous about the government getting into the broadcast  business.  Of course, I, that's perhaps a valid concern. 
[01:14:00]  And, uh, also there was pressure on, uh, some members of Congress, apparently, uh, from,  uh, owners of commercial broadcast stations who, who didn't want the government competing  with them.  So, VOA, uh, broadcast to the rest of the world.  We have 45 language services.  We have mainly radio, some television services, uh, the website, uh, and in some countries it  is the number one news broadcast, for example, in Afghanistan.  If in Afghanistan, wow, you guys imagine having to get ratings and go like, Hey, we're doing 
[01:14:30]  great in the Afghanistan, uh, 1834 men demo, believe it or not, in Afghanistan and in North  Korea that go out and do listener surveys.  Really?  Wow.  Do you ever have to do appearances by roadside bombs or anything?  See the wacky DJ thing, you know, how that goes.  I've been, I've been, I've been close enough to roadside bombs to, uh, to, to, to, to want  to keep my respectfulness.  Yeah, uh, uh, now out there in the field.  Now, you're not allowed to broadcast back to the, the United States, you said, right? 
[01:15:00]  But aren't you doing that through Twitter?  Well, it's not directed at Americans.  And that's one of the interesting things.  I love it.  How you can say that the Smith-Mount law may be archaic because, uh, and in fact, when,  when VOA first went on the internet, there, there were, there was some concern about,  oh my gosh, someone in the United States can actually, uh, access this directly.  Right.  Uh, but, uh, obviously technology has, has, has overcome those barriers, but the target  is definitely not, uh, Americans as far as our audience. 
[01:15:30]  And, and, and, uh, the problem, I, Eric M from Detroit, the problem is that they try to  verify the news before posting it.  Plus an editor reviews it.  That's why the delay.  That's part of it.  Yes.  All right.  But if you, if you got a little credibility behind you and it seems like Steve Herman does,  it's great to just get that news right, you know, out there to the people quickly.  Yeah.  That's what we're noticing with you, sir.  Well, it's, it's something that, uh, I actually, I got into Twitter when I was the, 
[01:16:00]  um, South Asia bureau chief based in Delhi when the, uh, Mumbai terror attack happened.  And, and I discovered it was a, a very quick way to sort of get a snapshot of what was  going on that, not necessarily take things on Twitter and put them on the air, but you  can definitely see trends developing.  And, and I have found Twitter actually to be a very reliable source as long as following  people that, that are considered credible.  So when I got, uh, first signed up for Twitter, I really never intended to, to be active tweeting.  It was rather, uh, another tool that I was looking at to gather information, which of 
[01:16:30]  course I still do as well.  Are you broadcasting to America by taking this phone call?  It seems like you're breaking a lot of rules, Steve.  It is not broadcasting.  Oh, this is not broadcasting.  Okay.  Hey, uh, and I also noticed that it looks like your whole job is to go to very dangerous places  around the world.  Del, uh, uh, Delhi.  Del, Delhi.  Delhi.  The Delhi.  You go to the Delhi.  The Delhi.  Pakistan.  Pakistan.  I've been to Delhi.  That's pretty nasty too. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, really.  Wow.  Yeah, uh, do you have, um, uh, loved ones that are worried about you a lot of times?  Uh, I think, uh, most people who, who were close to me quit worrying about me years ago.  Oh, really?  They just realized that's hopeless.  That's kind of cool.  It's kind of adventurous, you know, to be in, uh, some of those situations.  Uh, a little danger in your life.  Where do you, where do you call home?  I, uh, own a house in Tokyo.  I lived there for 16 years. 
[01:17:30]  I'm, I'm also, uh, from Las Vegas, Cincinnati originally, but, uh, grew up in Las Vegas.  That's, that's still my, uh, domicile in the United States because it has no state income  tax.  And, uh, I'm, I'm based in Seoul, Korea.  So, uh, I live in a bunch of different places.  Wow.  Well, uh, so what, what do you got as far as info, uh, going on in, uh, Japan right now?  And, and, and, and how close are you to the nuclear power plant?  I'm as close as you can get practically, uh, without being one of those, a few people left 
[01:18:00]  at the plant, uh, who are trying to put out the fire on about, uh, 45 miles to the west  of the plant.  I'm definitely in the zone now that the United States embassy, uh, yesterday, uh, declared,  uh, a zone of which an American, uh, uh, U.S. citizen should be out of.  Yeah.  And we will probably be out of here, uh, tomorrow.  What is happening right now is, um, uh, about, uh, five special, uh, fire trucks, uh, and, 
[01:18:30]  and other vehicles have been sent into the plant, uh, to try to put out the fire at the number  three reactor, which, uh, earlier in the week, uh, exploded, uh, has cooling issues with the  spent fuel, uh, in, in the, uh, in the pool, or these are rods that have been removed from  the plant.  Yeah.  They're being stored underwater. 
[01:19:00]  They're fine.  That contains, uh, mox fuel, which, which, which has, uh, plutonium in it.  And that's the one they're most concerned about.  And that is one of six reactors there.  And all six of those reactors are having problems to some degree.  Now, earlier in the day, uh, you may have seen this dramatic video of these, uh, Japan  self-defense force twin rotor helicopters, uh, doing four runs, dropping seven and a half  tons of water, uh, three shots at the number three reactor and one shot at the number four 
[01:19:30]  reactor.  And we haven't had anybody call it a success.  Obviously, if they sent the trucks in later, it, it, it wasn't a success, but we could see  on the, uh, video taken from 30 kilometers away.  I think that's about, uh, 20 miles, um, that, uh, the wind was sort of blowing the water.  Yeah.  Blowing it right off target.  So that's, that's the situation right now.  Um, the, um, the, as we speak, the, uh, nuclear safety agency. 
[01:20:00]  Uh, nuclear safety agency is, uh, holding a news conference down in Tokyo, explaining  some things.  And, um, I'm going to try to tape that while we're talking because obviously I can't do  two things at one time.  Don't interfere with your, your gig.  How many languages do you know?  I'm, uh, uh, I would say, I guess people consider me fluent in, uh, Japanese.  Uh, and, um, uh, so, and I've been working on my Korean and, uh, I like, um, uh, to study 
[01:20:30]  Mandarin, but I really haven't had any much time for language study.  Isn't it the same?  It's the same language, isn't it?  Well, to you, to you, it is.  Uh, what's your, what's your, like, uh, you, you, you, you stick to facts and what you  know and, um, uh, what you've learned and see.  What, though, is your, your gut feeling about what's going on, um, you know, as a person  you're, you're, you're there.  What are you feeling about this situation? 
[01:21:00]  Well, I would say that in the past 36 hours is the first time when I have thought there  is a decent probability that they may not be able to get this under control.  Hmm.  And you still feel that way?  Uh, well, I, uh, we have, we have seen nothing happen in the past day, uh, that, uh, that,  that changes my mind.  Now, they may come out any minute and say, look, we've, these water cannons, uh, that have 
[01:21:30]  been, uh, uh, putting water on the number three reactor are doing a good job.  Uh, they're also working to get power restored so that they can have, uh, uh, an electrical  powered cooling system because we had these multiple failures.  You know, it was the tsunami that came over, swamped the planet after the planet automatically  shut down on the earthquake.  Then they went on battery power for the cooling system.  The batteries failed and, and the transmission lines have been knocked out by the tsunami. 
[01:22:00]  It was just, you know, a cascade of, of horrible events that has put us where we're at today.  Right.  But, uh, you know, it's going to be whack-a-mole, I think, for a while in the sense that, well,  we've, you know, they may get one under control and then they've got to deal with another.  And if they've got high levels of radiation on the ground there, which they apparently  do, you can only keep these personnel in there for short periods of time.  Yeah, I guess that's, uh, putting a damper on the whole thing.  Jesus.  What, uh, what about getting power restored or getting some generators on site and, and getting 
[01:22:30]  those pumps up?  Well, again, you're, you're talking about a number of personnel that need to go in.  All right.  But right now, I think before they even are able to focus on that, the, the, the first  priority is to prevent a meltdown of these cooling rods, uh, so that they don't go critical  again and start spewing high levels of radiation into the atmosphere.  That's where we're at right now.  Uh, now I'm just getting word from the, um, uh, uh, Kyoto news agency that, uh, radiation 
[01:23:00]  levels have gone up after the water shot at the, um, at the Fukushima reactor.  Hmm.  Now what would that imply?  That has just been announced.  What would that imply?  Um, well, um, it, it could be that the water being sprayed is dispersing.  Yeah, exactly.  Some of the, some of the radiation out to the, you know, the, right outside the plant. 
[01:23:30]  I, I, you know, I don't know how to, uh, gauge the significance of that right now.  Wow.  That, that would, yeah, because if, if there is water hitting, uh, uh, the radioactive material  and then turning to steam, I would think that would be a way to carry the, uh, radiation  out of the plant and, and raise the levels.  Uh, it might also, uh, I'm just speculating, of course, it, it might also show that these  things might be uncovered, uh, to an extent. 
[01:24:00]  Well, the, the, the, well, the problem is, is that the, uh, the, uh, we believe that the,  uh, roofs of these, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, reactors, the buildings, that the roofs were  blown off by the explosions, these hydrogen explosions.  So they are exposed to the atmosphere and, uh, and that is definitely also the case at  the, uh, at the, at the, at the number, uh, four reactor, because I believe that cooling  pond is, is, is, is, has been exposed, uh, for a couple of days. 
[01:24:30]  And that four reactor also had a fire as well.  Well, it, it doesn't sound very promising that this is going to be, uh, taken care of  anytime soon.  That's for sure.  Um, what else, uh, what else do you think?  What do you see going on as far as the earthquake damage, uh, and tsunami damage, uh, that isn't  part of the nuclear power plant?  People, um, trying to get their lives back together?  It's unimaginable.  Uh, number one, you've, you've probably had hundreds of communities that were washed out 
[01:25:00]  to sea.  And, uh, they're not finding a lot of survivors.  Uh, the dead and missing right now is 13,000.  Uh, officially, it could actually be much higher than that.  There are international rescue crews.  One of my colleagues is, is up in Iwate, uh, prefecture today, uh, working on that.  I went up to, uh, Sendai one day this week.  The port of Sendai, uh, was, was, was, it was hit by an incredible tsunami.  And I was standing in the port of Sendai, and in every direction I looked, there were vehicles 
[01:25:30]  that had been destroyed in every way you can imagine.  They had been, uh, compressed like an accordion.  They had been put up one on top of another.  Uh, some were, were, you know, smashed horizontally, others vertically, uh, others that were flipped  upside down.  I have some pictures that were out on the, the voanews.com website.  Of course, we can't promote that to Americans.  But, um, um, uh, there is, and then you, I mean, you've all seen the, uh, the, the aerial, 
[01:26:00]  um, shots of, of, of, of these places.  Sendai, uh, part of the city is just gone.  And other parts, you go into downtown Sendai, and it looks like a modern, clean, bright Japanese  city, except, um, that there's, there's not a lot open.  And that's another big story, is part of Japan, from Tokyo on up, is just seizing up.  That's the word that I would use.  It's just like a piece of machinery that is, that is frozen, uh, on itself, uh, because, 
[01:26:30]  uh, supermarket shelves are, are, are empty.  Restaurants are closing.  I, I've been two times this week to a sushi shop here in Koryama, in Fukushima Prefecture,  where the owner is somehow managing to stay open, and the fish is great.  Uh-oh.  And he's advertising a disaster sushi set for 1,500 bucks.  Two-headed tuna.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know how, boy, I'd, I'd be a little leery of eating anything, uh, north of Tokyo. 
[01:27:00]  Well, I remember all the fish that still, that has come in, is, is, probably came in, uh,  before, um, all of this, uh, radiation.  Yeah, that's, that's, that's true.  That's the problem.  There's no, there's no logistics anymore.  Yeah.  Part of the country's not getting resupplied, and now with the, the radiation fear, definitely,  I would say, around Fukushima Prefecture, that, uh, there's going to be truck drivers afraid  to come in, and, and all sorts of things. 
[01:27:30]  We'll probably leave, uh, Fukushima Prefecture, uh, tomorrow.  Oh, really?  I, I suspect we're going to have to.  There's just, there's nothing left here, really, in terms of, uh, we, we went to, uh, uh, the, uh, the only supermarket in town that was open today for six hours.  The shelves were almost all empty, grabbed a box of bottled water, uh, some, some, uh, supermarkets, sushi, some snacks, and, uh, I can tell you tomorrow, there will be nothing, uh, to eat in that entire supermarket in this city. 
[01:28:00]  And there are major cities up and down the coast that this is the situation right now.  Wow.  And no resupply in the, uh, foreseen future, huh?  Wow.  That is something, man.  Yeah, so we have a number of, of, of just unbelievable events all going on at the same time in eastern and northern Japan.  Now, uh, as far as, uh, south of Tokyo and Tokyo itself, uh, is it, is it for the most part business as usual? 
[01:28:30]  Um, no.  No?  No, Tokyo is not, uh, business as usual.  Now, some people, there are some train lines still running, and some people have gone to work, uh, this week, but a lot of the commuter trains, most people in Tokyo rely on commuter trains to get to and from work.  They're not running.  Uh, if you look at the, uh, and I've talked to people who've said there's, there's, there's been runs on all sorts of things from toilet paper to bottled water to batteries in Tokyo.  And, oh, we're having an earthquake right now, an aftershock. 
[01:29:00]  Um, this is, Matt, this is a, this is a pretty small one.  We eat these for breakfast these days.  Oh, my God.  Holy gee.  I just held my breath, and I'm nowhere near that.  Well, you never, when they start off, you never know how big they're going to get.  Right, they all start the same, huh?  And, uh, you just wait, you just pause.  Oh, God, you're just going to sit there.  We've been getting these, they're almost every couple hours.  Wow.  And we've had, we've had, um, two this week that have been above magnitude six, and there was a warning from the Japan Meteorological Agency, I think it was on Sunday, that, uh, we were going to get another magnitude seven earthquake. 
[01:29:30]  Uh, I mean, they were actually saying that within the first three days, there was a 70% chance, and then after that, a 50% chance within the next few days.  So, uh, we're, we're due for that at the moment.  Oh, my God.  Just unbelievable.  Uh, yeah, well, uh, we love your, we love your tweets, uh, very informative. 
[01:30:00]  Um, Andy Levy, uh, from Red Eye over there, Fox News, he turned us on to, uh, you, and, um, it's, it's really cool.  It's, uh, good to have somebody that's right there putting that info out there immediately.  Yeah, we're talking to Steve Herman on Twitter.  It's W7VOA.  So, uh, anything else there, Steve?  I think we covered most of it, but maybe not.  Yeah, I, I, I think we just really need to find out, um, what has happened, uh, tonight with, um, with this, uh, spraying operation. 
[01:30:30]  Uh, they've said that they're not going to try the, the helicopters again today.  I don't know if they're even going to try that at all again.  It didn't look very effective.  The next 24 hours is absolutely critical, but we are seeing a situation now.  I, I don't, we didn't really talk about the, uh, the, the evacuations that are going on, even from Tokyo, where, uh, the United States Embassy is bringing in, uh, charter flights from overseas to put Americans on those planes.  Other, uh, governments, uh, have, uh, have advised their, uh, nationals to actually leave Tokyo. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, uh, a little telling.  And that's because of the radiation.  It's partly due to the radiation.  The other problem is just with the, with the infrastructure, with supplies running out.  Right, right.  If we do have a significant venting of radiation into the atmosphere, you can imagine that that would cause even more of this, uh, panic buying in places like Tokyo.  Sure.  And what was the other, uh, oh, uh, and, uh, is it possible this gets to a level seven, the nuclear power plant situation? 
[01:31:30]  Uh, yeah.  We're at a six right now, right?  I hate EA about that.  I think we're already at a six, right?  Yeah, that's, yeah.  Let's say we're at a six.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, by the way, uh, some of, uh, the, um, people listening on Twitter want to know what is a prefecture.  It is basically a state.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, you could assume in the context he put it in what it means.  I wasn't going to assume that because Japan's only as big as Montana, which is a state.  Yeah, was here a prefect?  Hey, prefect.  Your states are very tiny over there. 
[01:32:00]  From the oldie days.  Yeah.  Uh, well, again, thanks, and thanks for coming on the air with us, and we'll, uh, keep, um, looking at your tweets.  What's the, uh, what's the, uh...  W7 VOA.  W7 VOA.  That, uh, when I never knew that, uh, I would be such a presence on Twitter, I thought I'd always be more of a follower than, than, than, than having a big following.  But that is, in case you're trying to figure out what that means, obviously the VOA part, but W7 VOA is my ham radio call sign.  I assume that had to be some kind of ham radio thing, because, yeah, W7. 
[01:32:30]  I was a little bit of a radio geek in my day, uh, back, uh, back in the 70s.  Okay.  Which, as I said, was not a biggie.  We were just getting the information out.  It was, uh, centered here in Fukushima Prefecture.  It is a magnitude 4.4.  Uh, it's not even worth commenting on.  Jeez, that's...  Oh, that's easy.  That's nothing.  You go through that.  Oh, you guys.  That's nothing.  You guys over there.  You're just wacky. 
[01:33:00]  Uh...  All right, Steve, can we call you again, or what?  Sure.  It'd be great.  Uh, like I say, I, I, I don't know where we will be tomorrow.  Probably somewhere differently, and hopefully we'll still be in, uh, telephone range or mobile phone range.  Let's see.  That was pretty good.  All right, good.  All right.  He's relieved.  He's more relieved he made it through an Opie and Anthony phone call than...  Then the earthquake, yeah.  Then the earthquake itself.  That's horrible.  All right, Steve.  Thank you so much, sir.  Have a good one, guys.  Yeah, you too.  Stay safe.  Steve Herman, everyone, live from Japan. 
[01:33:30]  Everybody, see, because I wanted info from the guy, because everybody was just saying,  Anthony, you've got to go, paging Mr. Herman, paging Mr. Herman, you have a telephone call  at the front desk.  I was going to go with, I was going to go with a peewee thing.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  So peewee.  That's pretty cool.  We got that guy on our side.  Yes.  Which is nice.  Which, which is nice.  4.4.  He goes, it's not even worth commenting about.  Half of us would shit our pants if we felt a 4.4 right now in New York. 
[01:34:00]  It's just like, hang on.  Yeah, we're having an earthquake.  Yeah, yeah.  We're having an earthquake.  Then I stopped breathing, because now I'm waiting to see if it's going to be a really  big one or what.  This is him yelling at somebody.  We didn't get to this, but this is him yelling at somebody earlier.  I'm trying to use that phone!  See, it was, uh, and he couldn't hear from all the noise.  What?  What?  Ha ha ha!  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, thank God we caught him right after this. 
[01:34:30]  Morning, Mr. Blackfell!  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay!  Ha ha ha!  I pity the poor fool who don't eat my cereal!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  You know what?  Mr. Herman, Mr. Herman, you have a telephone.  call at the front desk.  Ha ha ha!  And, you know, he called on a very special day for himself.  Did he?  Yes, he did.  Thank you.  Thank you, old dear friends. 
[01:35:00]  For coming to my birthday!  Ha ha ha!  We can't just leave it alone.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Come on, everybody!  Wake up!  Rise and shine!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  We had a great conversation.  It was very informative.  Steve Herman!  The guy's right there on the front lines.  Yes.  And we can't just leave it alone.  He did tape his reaction when he saw the tsunami coming in.  Did he?  Ah! 
[01:35:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Uh, something living in some of the rubble, though.  Uh, yes, you are a pretty kitty!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha! 
[01:36:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ah, I don't watch it.  We don't watch American Idol anymore, but this is definitely a headline today.  Uh, KC Abrams, I guess?  KC Abrams!  song smells like teen spirit which is so bizarre yeah if you really think about it on american idol  who's uh in charge of like giving them well they got a music director i don't know they figured  that shit out i mean i mean don't they need permission and can someone say no man we're not  gonna let you use the music man thumbs up or down with selena gomez as she's on tv right where well

[01:45:00]  happen and then well i click you can't do it to every person not that guy you gotta keep  he's our in he's our in on in japan you gotta keep the guests uh guessing and the listeners guessing  exactly hey uh american idol speaking of japan why wait till you hear this one  fucking assholes are you reading a fortune cookie i know what is that little strip of paper that you  have it's the description of the disc oh okay i was wondering where you got that i swear it's a 
[01:45:30]  little it's a little fortune cookie strip you're reading yeah it really is you can show the people  over there what's going on it's just a little fortune well this this is how they give you things  to read this is what they give you put on your reading glasses i think i know i have to hold it  10 feet from my face i can't see anything up close anymore damn damn your eyes man i think american 
[01:46:00]  idol had a bit of a fail last night fail possibly an epic fail oh is this an epic fail i don't know  what is it it's about japan there's something wrong with the world today hey there like everyone else  we've been watching the devastating events in japan yeah and tonight we'd like to offer our help  our hearts and our prayers go out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy so once the show  finishes tonight you will be able to purchase the downloads of the songs with profits going to the 
[01:46:30]  american red cross and their relief effort in japan that's tonight profit and our results show tomorrow  night we'll let you know how you can text in your donations thank you in advance for all your  generosity now let's go this is american idol i really don't miss this show at all wow they're teasing  how you can give money by text but they're teasing it yeah because they want you to tune in the next 
[01:47:00]  they want you to tune in tomorrow or to or which i guess that would be today there's something wrong  with the world today that sounded great yeah wow yikes his voice is not holding up why tease a text  yeah tease a text a text a text a number to text to to to help out japan even opie wouldn't do that  hell fucking hell they could have got another day of donations yes but instead they're teasing it so  then tonight they'll give you the the number to text to help out japan that's pretty bad i'm 
[01:47:30]  thinking that is mainstream media should get on that one that's using uh a tragedy to try to boost  your ratings up a little bit and those people are waiting for their fucking you know donations oh yeah  oh my goodness and then last night uh we had this casey abrams casey abrams uh sam told us that uh  the theme last night was sing a song from the year you were born you were born yeah so he chose chose  smells like teen spirit oh my god he's so old oh boy how old is that song now i had already stopped 
[01:48:00]  doing cocaine by the time that fucking yeah song came out i had gone through my coke phase and stopped  doing it what is it 91 92 right yeah 91 well it came out in september 91 so we're talking almost 20 years  ago wow 20 years ago this is a class this is a classic rock rock this is classic rock because  when i was spinning tunes we were playing when i was doing it in the 90s we were playing stuff from 
[01:48:30]  the 70s put it this way this would be a classic rock song when this song came out that would be the  same thing as playing a song from 1971 right so if you were playing you could be playing a brand new  71 would be right around zeppelin song or abby roadish yeah yeah yeah kinda yeah oh my god that's crazy  that's fucked up right there this would be a classic rock song now classic rock all right well here's casey 
[01:49:00]  performing smells like teen spirit let's see how he did all right this is a tough song 
[01:49:30]  song to sing that sounds like uh what's her name singing he's articulating every word i saw this  i saw the signs it ended to opened up my eyes i saw the signs life is demanding without understanding  fucking great i listened to that whole thing that we did i guess we replayed it like a week ago yeah  when i was driving home i listened to that whole thing when she came in  fucking hysterical live we gotta get we gotta get an update on her holy 
[01:50:00]  shit  hello hello hello hello hello hello all right  Hello, hello, with the lights out, it's a danger, here we are now, entertain us, I feel stupid and contagious, here we are now, entertain us, I'm a laddo, an albino, a mosquito, a mosquito, a genital, a genital, a genital. 
[01:50:30]  A genital, a genital, a genital, a genital, a genital, a genital, a genital, a genital. 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  That is really rough.  Look, the only thing I can say, it is a very tough song to sing.  To begin with.  And when he went into it, boy, he had a real clunker there.  I don't know what to think.  What am I going to say?  Why is every phone lit? 
[01:51:30]  What happened now?  What happened?  What happened that every fucking phone is lit?  I don't know.  Maybe people want to say he sucks.  Really?  They want in on this?  What did the judges say?  Good question.  Well, I want to guess, because I don't watch the show.  They have to trash this.  I would think, yeah.  But there's no one to trash the performers anymore, right?  They're all nice, I hear?  Who's the trash guy?  I think that...  Who's he trashing that?  Is Randy?  Randy's doing...  Randy's so stepped up.  But he was never a trash guy. 
[01:52:00]  Well, he had to be, because he's the last of the original.  Right.  So he's got to step into the trash guy.  You know J-Lo and Steven Tyler are going to just be...  No, man.  They've got to trash this kid.  Yeah.  Let's find out.  Casey!  Casey, you are so good, man.  Wow.  The crowd's loving it.  I guess it sounded better live, huh?  If you were there.  Hold on.  Let me say hi to Jeremy in Indiana.  Jeremy.  Sounds like Billy Madison singing.  A lot of people... 
[01:52:30]  Someone said Adam Sandler, yeah.  That's why the phone's lit.  Everyone is saying that he sounds like Adam Sandler.  Like Adam Sandler.  Very good, Jeremy.  Thank you.  You represent a lot of people out there that have the same...  Jeremy called up with his opinion.  All right.  Let's listen to the judges.  Casey.  Casey, you are so good, man.  You're so crazy, and you're so talented.  And that's the perfect match.  To be crazy and talented and have it all together at the same time,  that's the goop the great stuff is made from. 
[01:53:00]  And you got it, man.  You got it.  You got it.  In this business we call show, you have the goop.  Steven Tyler said that was good.  He's got the goop.  How is he saying that's good?  Well, Casey has been a favorite throughout the season,  so there are also, I think, a lot of...  Is he the Will Ferrell looking one?  Yes.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  He does kind of look like Will Ferrell.  He looks like a young Will Ferrell.  Yeah.  And he also looks like Zach.  Yeah.  Zach Galifianakis.  Yeah.  He's been a favorite throughout the season,  so I think that has a lot... 
[01:53:30]  This is definitely his worst performance.  Dude, that was horrendous.  That wasn't good.  Did I hear something different?  No, this was his worst performance.  It was really bad.  That was...  And I think Ann or someone said that he was off.  He was behind.  Yeah, but...  Yeah, he was a little off.  And then he had to catch up.  He had to clunker.  I think that they liked his other performances so much,  and he's built up this little charm thing.  Benefit of the doubt.  They gave him the benefit of the doubt.  Precisely.  All right, that's what Steven Tyler said.  I hate the benefit of the doubt.  Let's move on.  Kurt Cobain, that's some big shoes to fill with that song, boy.  And it was a risk. 
[01:54:00]  And there was parts in it where it got a little bit screamy-screechy.  Yeah.  You know, he had the intensity, but he didn't scream all the way.  You know what I mean?  And so it still has to sound pleasant, and all of your performances are so pleasant  and so amazing to listen to.  I just wish I would have had a little bit more of that.  But you know I love you so much.  That means she hated it.  What do you think I hate about this fucking show?  That's her basically saying I hated it.  Yeah, I didn't like it.  So why can't you go, look, I hated that.  But she likes him.  I don't understand that.  She cannot give a negative review. 
[01:54:30]  But I hate when they go, you know I love you.  That means, look, that was awful.  I'm going to say it was okay.  Well, you have to translate what they say.  She's the one this season who, after a bad performance, goes,  first of all, you look great tonight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Taking up the...  Why can't we be mean?  She's abdueling a little bit.  Yeah.  Why can't you be mean?  Abdul.  Well, Simon, that's what Simon was for.  And there's no...  I mean, Randy is a little more technical, but even he's not mean. 
[01:55:00]  Simon would have been like, that was atrocious.  Yeah.  That was a screaming mess.  It sounded like a karaoke on a cruise ship.  That's why X Factor is going to be with Tom.  Oh, of course.  That's going to be the shiznit.  That's going to be the shiznit.  All right.  And then finally, Randy.  I think you're sexy.  Sexy still, that's what counts, right?  Listen, listen, me being a musician and me being a producer, writer, all the stuff that 
[01:55:30]  I do, right?  What I'm most impressed with and what I love about you and what you represent, like great  other bands, Radiohead, Muse, Licky Lee, whatever you, whatever you, whoever, you love  taking risks.  And I love that you're putting art first and then thinking about commerce.  It wasn't your best performance or the best vocal or anything, but I like that you're  fearless.  You are.  That's what we need.  Fearlessness.  Come on.  Come on, dog.  Bam.  Bam.  And they changed that music. 
[01:56:00]  That means like, yeah, yeah, we're done talking.  Yep.  It's time for Ryan to come in with the phone numbers.  Right.  Come on, Ryan.  Zero five.  You know what?  I made the...  And the guy holds up five fingers like, five, five, five, five, five.  I made the right decision.  I don't need to watch this show.  I...  I heard it completely different.  I couldn't.  It's still good.  It was horrible.  The show, I mean, is still good.  No, it's not.  It's compelling.  No, no, it's not.  What made that show great was Simon telling these kids how it is.  Yeah.  And like Jimmy says, you know, it would be nice to see him do that to young rappers, 
[01:56:30]  but, you know, we all pick easy targets to go after, right?  I'm an easy target.  But now you don't have that guy that is, you know, keeping it real.  Yeah.  And being honest with these guys.  Yeah.  Because a lot of times Simon would have to turn around and just tell the audience to go fuck themselves.  Right.  That's how he sees it, and fuck you.  What a boring show.  And they'd be boo, boo.  What a boring show if they all just like everything.  Everyone's great.  Well, you still get to see...  How do you know when they really like something?  That's what I need to know today.  How do you know?  You can tell when they really like something, because they actually start complimenting parts 
[01:57:00]  of the song, and they start really getting excited.  Not just your vocals stunk.  I really didn't like it.  But I liked the fact that you took a chance.  Right.  This one, they were complimenting him on taking a chance and saying they were talking about  him overall.  Yeah.  That the music itself was terrible.  Not this performance.  So is there a website where you could translate what they're saying so you know exactly what  they mean?  No.  That would be good.  You've got to watch and really know.  Obviously, when they go, you know I love you, that means, oh boy, we're going to talk 
[01:57:30]  about anything but your performance.  So you've got to think, okay, she didn't like it.  But that sucks.  That's not a way to do things.  No.  We're starting with a compliment on the haircut.  Oh, really?  Oh, that doesn't bode well.  No.  All right.  Enough of that.  The only reason we brought it to the show is because he sang Nirvana, which is very strange.  Give it a try anyway.  I don't think Nirvana ever wanted his songs on.  Nirvana never wanted his songs?  Why would I?  Kurt Nirvana?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he was Nirvana.  Come on.  Well, Dave Grohl. 
[01:58:00]  Dave Grohl has shown some fucking skills after that band.  Dave Grohl has had a career that's like so much longer than fucking Nirvana's was.  And probably at this point, not even probably, has sold more records than Nirvana did.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  Amazing.  You're right.  Grohl rules.  But I don't think Kurt wanted his songs on a poppy TV show.  On a poppy TV show.  The reason he put a fucking shotgun in his mouth was the exact thing.  I think the reason was because he was on the Huron.  You think that's it?  Yeah.  I think he just wasn't, he couldn't be happy with where he was because the whole, I think 
[01:58:30]  he was a lot happier just in a garage.  What, he was a tortured fucking artist?  Yeah, one of those.  Look, I'm not agreeing with it.  I'm just saying they're out there.  Yeah, what a tough fucking life you have.  They're out there.  How about you be a plumber?  That would have been silly, him singing that song.  Sorry to the plumbers out there, but I just picked your profession.  Putting together a couple of pipes and some fittings.  Probably sucked at it.  Putting some Teflon tape around some PVC.  Singing.  Hey, shut up. 
[01:59:00]  Go get me more glue.  Hey, Kurt.  I have to go out to the van.  Helper.  That wouldn't work.  That would be a sucky life.  That would suck.  He had a great life.  Right up until, you know.  Well, if he was able to keep it together.  Yeah.  And by together, you mean his head.  I think the Heron influenced his tortured soul thing.  Come on.  All right.  Smells like your septic tank is back.  Very good, Danny. 
[01:59:30]  Nice.  Before we move on from music, because we like to talk about music and make believe we know what's going on out there.  We certainly do.  Very important day to music history today.  Let me think.  Very important.  And there were a lot of clues in this segment that we're in.  I'll just say that.  I love games.  A lot of clues in this segment.  Okay.  I will say that 20 years ago today, Sergeant Pepper taught his band to play or something. 
[02:00:00]  I'll give you 13 years ago.  13 years ago today.  So that would bring us to 19...  13 years ago.  98?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm closer to death.  Way closer.  My girlfriend was born.  Get it?  Get it?  I'm a pedo.  You are?  If you are.  Don't put a question mark there. 
[02:00:30]  1998, Ant.  1998.  Ask the questions.  It's very important.  Music.  Music.  You got to hear my voice a little bit.  A very important day of music history.  Yeah.  I'm catching a little sarcasm here.  Okay.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Just a tad bit of sarcasm is leaking out of the Opie reactor.  So it helps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  1998.  And there were clues within this break.  Clues within the break.  So we're looking at...  Clues within this break we're in the middle of. 
[02:01:00]  Is it anything to do with Kurt Cobain?  No.  Is it the grunge genre?  No.  Is it radio?  No.  It's music.  I mean...  Well, music could be radio.  I guess.  I mean...  You're going to let me ask the questions?  Oh, sorry.  You can argue.  Sorry.  Why would you ask radio?  I don't know.  I'm talking about music.  Because I thought maybe it was our career or something.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Something very important 13 years ago.  Oh, yeah.  This was a milestone. 
[02:01:30]  A milestone.  And that's no sarcasm there.  This was certainly a milestone.  All right.  Does it have to do with...  Also known as jumping the shark.  Oh.  That's the biggest clue I'll give you right now.  Don't look down.  I'm not.  Is it a...  You got your cheaters helping you out right now.  I'm not even looking.  Is it a band?  Of course.  Okay.  Is it a band with a girl in it?  No.  Okay.  Band with a...  I don't know why I paused there. 
[02:02:00]  I know.  I'm like, wait a minute.  What the fuck is that?  There's no reason for a pause there.  Okay.  I don't want to throw you off.  Was it a live performance that happened?  No.  No.  Was it a record that came out?  Yes.  Okay.  So it was...  1998.  An album was released by a band.  Yes.  And this was them jumping the shark pretty much.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't Rapping Rush, was it?  No.  All right.  Clues within the break. 
[02:02:30]  Clues within the break.  American Idol.  No.  Okay.  That was the whole break we did.  Wait a minute.  Oh, it wasn't?  Let me think.  Okay.  Is it a rock?  Rock band?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  And did they do something stupid?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe at the time they didn't think they were doing something stupid.  If that helps you.  Damn it.  You know?  I might.  I think I know it.  Okay. 
[02:03:00]  By the way, when I start these silly little games, they're not supposed to be this long.  I know, but I'm terrible at these games.  The answer is not going to be as great as the build-up.  But I'm terrible at these games, but I want to know it.  This was supposed to be a quickie.  I just want to acknowledge that.  I want to win.  You want to win?  I want to win.  I know you like winning.  Danny, write it down.  Don't show it.  No, no.  Okay.  It's a band.  They put an album out.  It's an album, right?  They put it.  Well, yeah, but. 
[02:03:30]  An album out that.  It's all connected.  And Opie's thinking it's a big.  Jump in the shark.  It was a big mistake, this album.  Yes.  And they would even admit to it.  Are they still together?  Oh.  Where are they at now?  Probably taking a little bit of a break, but certainly not retired, I don't think.  No, they're definitely not retired.  They're not retired?  Are they actively out there?  They're actively preparing to do something.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah. 
[02:04:00]  Okay, good.  Yeah.  So they're not retired.  Ah.  And they certainly have moved on from this big mistake.  Just a horrible mistake.  I am freaking out.  I don't know.  And there was clues within this break.  But I didn't remember anything but the American Idol break.  I always only remember the last thing we did.  Look, I'm peddling my ass off when I... 
[02:04:30]  All right, ask a couple more questions.  Uh...  Uh...  Man.  And this will be a letdown, everyone, when we finally let this out.  This should have been just a throwaway thing I say quickly coming back from music.  Was it a...  And do you have...  And you got something when he gets the answer?  What genre was this?  Rock.  It was rock, but...  1998.  Jumpin' the Shark.  Release something.  Obviously an album.  Ah.  Clues within this break.  Fuck. 
[02:05:00]  To the identity of this band.  I can't...  Oh, my God.  Was it a hair band?  No, not in 1998.  No.  No.  Did they sell a lot of records?  Was it a very popular band?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did we used to play them on AAF?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Okay.  Okay.  A little bit.  And if we were still at AAF, we probably would have played this. 
[02:05:30]  But I think we were gone by then, right?  I think.  We left in 98.  98?  99?  99?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Ah, fuck, fuck.  I have to give up.  God, everyone on instant feedback.  But then again, they could be Googling their asses off, so I don't trust them.  Yeah, I don't either.  You give up?  Yeah.  Give me a clue that you think will blow it.  The one will definitely give it away.  I'm trying to come up with something a little different. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, believe me, it probably won't.  I'm never good at these.  You want, like, the first two seconds of the hit song?  Oh, I think that's going to give it away, but that's fine.  Give them two.  I could name that tune in.  Two seconds?  And was this the hit from that album?  Yeah, this was the big hit.  All right, give them two seconds.  And go.  That's a little drumbeat thing.  God, I hate this game.  I don't like this. 
[02:06:30]  Derek from Brooklyn, is this a new segment on the show called OP Shitty Trivia?  Yeah.  Because I like how it drives Ed nuts.  Because this was supposed to be a throwaway.  I'm going crazy.  All right, give them five seconds.  Okay.  Yeah, you've got to give him more than just a drumbeat.  Five seconds, go.  That was the same thing.  It was just a loop.  That sucks.  At the time, the band probably thought it wasn't a big mistake. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Because...  Is it a rock band trying to do rap?  No.  All right, is it a rock band trying to do, like, ballad?  No.  Is it a rock band trying to fucking...  Oh, God.  All right, we've got to go with...  Is it Metallica?  No, we've got to go now.  Fifteen seconds. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, God.  Go.  Rock cut?  Rock cut?  Oh, boy.  I hope the vocals don't pop in.  Oh, that's a good hand.  Hey, you...  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right, now what?  Okay.  You got the vocals.  Is that Sammy Hagar?  Well, remember when I said...  Yes.  ...within this break, had a clue?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The clue would be Sammy Hagar.  Sammy Hagar.  Because that's how we started this break.  That's why I'm amazed we're still doing this. 
[02:08:00]  So it was Sammy Hagar joined Van Halen.  He didn't join Van Halen 13 years ago?  Left Van Halen.  Yes.  He left Van Halen.  And they replaced him with Gary Cherone.  With Gary Cherone.  And put out that flop album.  In rock history.  Van Halen released Van Halen 3 with Gary Cherone 13 years ago today.  Oh.  Your clue was we started talking about Sammy Hagar, but you forgot that.  But I...  No, because it was...  And that would have tied the whole Van Halen thing in. 
[02:08:30]  I remember the Imus part, but I didn't think about Sammy Hagar.  And they made him try to sound like Sammy Hagar, if you remember.  Yeah, listen to that.  Turn this up.  Yeah, you...  So you think you made it back now?  Cause you know it's coming out of the way you're back at time.  Oh, this was killing his voice.  Here I have my way home.  Better make up your mind.  This is terrible.  It's horrible, right?  That's it.  Oh.  It's like sideways Van Halen. 
[02:09:00]  It almost sounds like Sammy Hagar.  They tried to tour with him, and he just...  He was blowing his voice out.  It was a disaster.  After, like, one song trying to sound like Sammy.  Only Sammy can sound like Sammy.  But they made him try to sound like Sammy.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  They like the Sammy angle.  Keep up your good nature.  I apologize once again.  A lot of apologies lately, but that was supposed to be just a quickie, but...  I think people like seeing me in pain.  Yeah.  And defeat.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Trying to get the job done, and...  Oh, my God.  Is this happening?  I'm embarrassed to be in radio.  Are we officially still on radio if we're on satellite?  What happened?  We shouldn't look at this as radio anymore, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Alex in California.  Go ahead.  Alex?  I'll be with that stunt.  You owe us 45 minutes.  Anyway, there is a station here in San Jose that's playing Japanese music, medication  to Japan for 24 hours straight, and it's starting to make me feel uncomfortable. 
[02:10:00]  They're playing Japanese music for 24 hours straight because of what happened in Japan?  Yeah, why?  That's right.  What is that supposed to do?  I don't know.  It's supposed to get people to listen, I guess.  I don't know.  And what does it sound like?  Here, hold on.  Hold on.  Here it is.  I don't know what this is all about.  What's the channel?  Maybe we can listen online because now I've got to hear this. 
[02:10:30]  92.3.  What's the calls on that?  There's a lot of 92.3s across the country.  There certainly are.  We were on one.  K-S-J-O.  K-S-J-O.  K-S-J-O.  All right.  We'll check it out.  Fucking Japanese music for 24 hours just because of the tsunami.  That sounds prongous.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break.  We've got Colin King coming in to say hi.  It's been a while.  Oh, yes.  And we also got the Tiger Woods stuff.  We've got Tiger Woods farting on TV.  Mm-hmm.  And we got Jimmy Fallon had, I guess, Tiger on the show, right? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  And thanks, Tiger Woods, for the controversy because it helped Jimmy Fallon's show with  the jokes and all that, right?  Yeah.  It gave him a little head start.  And Cassius in Brooklyn wants everyone to know that Courtney Love killed Kurt Cobain.  Everyone knows that.  Well, we all know that.  We all know that.  Of course.  She just got away with it, so.  Yeah.  All right.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm your present. 
[02:11:30]  I'm here dreaming of you.  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong. 
[02:12:00]  I'm gonna lose you.  You belong.  Sirius 197 XM 202.  The virus.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Certainly is.  That just made it sound like a great show, huh?  Yeah.  Very dramatic.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Is this the band? 
[02:12:30]  What?  This is the band.  Is this Japanese rock, Travis?  Yeah, this is X Japan.  Nice!  We got Colin Cain in studio and just to catch him up.  What's up, guys?  There's a radio station in California, 92.3 KSJO.  They felt like they needed to play 24 hours of Japanese music in honor of the earthquake and tsunami. 
[02:13:00]  Why?  What?  Yeah, exactly.  We don't know why.  That makes no sense.  So this is probably...  Why torture us?  Yeah, right?  This is probably one of the songs they're playing, I guess.  So we can suffer along?  Yeah, I don't know.  That's all I'm getting out of this.  We could all send our thoughts and prayers and everybody be cool and, you know, oh, yeah,  we need the help and everything, but let's not go on a limb and say that these motherfuckers  are making good rock music.  Yeah.  Please.  We should send our prayers to these guys playing this music because they clearly need help. 
[02:13:30]  They're the ones that...  Yeah.  This sounds like what they were probably going through as the earthquake was happening.  It sounds like they're very frightened.  Well, it doesn't seem too hard, though.  If you listen to it in the background, Faden, it's not too hard.  I don't know.  We're going to move on.  Yeah, we're going to do something else in a second.  But Tim Simpson then says, from Bethpage Long Island, he goes, there are some and some  in big letters, Anthony.  Decent Japanese rock bands.  Check out Dirt and Gray.  They are okay. 
[02:14:00]  Really?  And then I said to you, there can't be good rock bands in Japan if bands that we forgot  about in the United States 20 years ago go over there and sell out.  And sell out stadiums.  Yeah.  That's probably a clue that they're not coming up with great Japanese rock bands.  And you don't see people going to fucking stadiums here to go see Chang Vang Kwan.  You know?  Wouldn't that be Chinese?  We don't...  Well, okay.  Or...  Urugusa.  Yeah, there you go. 
[02:14:30]  That's it.  That's it.  Hashimashiga.  Yeah, that's Japanese.  Yeah.  Do the other one again.  Dong Chwang Kwan.  Oh, that's Chinese.  Dong Chwang Kwan.  What about Korean?  A little anger.  Can you tell the difference between Chinese people and Korean people?  No.  No?  I don't think so.  Yeah, I can.  Yeah?  No, I think I can.  What do you think it is?  Japanese have...  Their eyes are a little...  No, Japanese are different.  Japanese are amongst their own.  Yeah.  But Chinese and Korean are kind of close.  Oh, I can tell the difference. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah?  Koreans like crew cuts.  Yeah.  Well, they all have awful hair.  They all have awful hair.  But they can't really do much with it.  If you don't put product in, like, Asian people's hair, they look like a 12-year-old  lady boy.  It's just...  And the Chinese have...  They gave up and they all have the exact same haircut.  I got this figured out.  They do.  Koreans...  Bear with me.  Koreans, crew cuts.  Chinese, all the same haircut.  Japanese people try...  Oh, they try.  They're more like, um...  How did I describe this one time?  Where their hair... 
[02:15:30]  They try to make their hair different even though they have the same face.  Yeah.  Kind of like...  Kind of like, uh...  Yeah.  What's the fucking toy that you use to put different things on but you can tell it's  the same fucking thing?  Because...  What are you talking about?  Uh, Mr. Potato Head or...  Uh, not Mr. Potato Head.  What was the one I used to use?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, it's the same joke I use when I talk about, uh, water heads.  You mean it's the same face and you just put...  Same face but different hairdos.  Uh, I don't know about that.  It wasn't Mr. Potato Head.  Ann, look down. 
[02:16:00]  Help me out.  Um, wait a minute.  I'm looking, yeah.  Well, whatever.  No one's helping.  Of course.  I don't know that one.  Why help me in the middle of this bomb?  No one's helping.  Why help me in the middle of this bomb?  Just let the radiation get me.  It's fine.  Give me a helicopter.  I want out of this fucking bomb I started.  We need to...  We need to splash you with water to cool your core down.  It was going good, though.  Koreans, crew cuts.  Yes.  Chinese, same haircut.  Japanese, different hairstyles to look...  Try to look different.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  I like that with the bleach.  So it's a little blonde.  Yeah.  And then it's going one direction or the other.  They like really a spiky, wacky...  Yeah, Chinese guys, I don't think are...  Just woke up.  Chinese guys are into...  Japanese guys are.  Japanese guys are good.  But there's just a rule, though, that Asian girls with blonde hair, that's just a whore.  That's just a rule.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If you're an Asian, you have blonde hair, you're just a whore.  It's just an automatic rule.  A whore.  It is.  Think about it.  Have you ever seen an Asian with blonde hair?  You look at her twice.  Like, all right, she definitely...  She's a goer.  She's a goer.  She's the one in the world. 
[02:17:00]  She's a goer.  That's the rule.  Yeah, I think you're right.  They look like anime characters.  Do you guys want to hear Dirt and Gray?  Yeah, let's hear it.  I think that's how you pronounce it.  Because this guy's saying this is decent Japanese rock.  Decent Japanese rock.  And we say nothing like that exists.  You're about to hear decent Japanese rock, according to this dude from Bethpage.  Here we go.  Very good.  I like it.  All right.  Here it comes.  Sounds like Van Halen with Gary Cherone again. 
[02:17:30]  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Right.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  What's happening here?  What the hell is this crap? 
[02:18:00]  I don't know, but I just killed my mom.  Yeah.  Uh.  This sucks.  Oh.  Well, this could be any language.  When do you get the...  I don't know too much about heavy metal.  I'm not feeling this, yo. 
[02:18:30]  Are you feeling this?  No.  It's too hard for my taste, but it's not bad for what it is, you know?  Yeah.  It's actually pretty good for what it is.  You like the, uh...  You're like this thrashy...  Nah, this is heavier than thrash.  He's all...  He's all...  Screamy.  Death metal.  Nah, I'm not into the whole screamy stuff.  No.  I...  That throat thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's still good.  Do they just shred their throats? 
[02:19:00]  That...  I don't know.  It seems to me like...  Like...  That isn't very hard to...  To put together.  A song.  Like, to write that song.  Doesn't seem very hard.  Very hard.  You like melodies.  Just go, go, go, go, go.  You're a melody guy.  Yeah, yeah.  You like a little melody.  I like a little hook in the song.  And a little, uh...  Harmonizing.  I like a little hook in the song.  You know what I mean?  A little harmony.  Yeah, that's kind of nice.  I hear ya.  I hear ya.  Hmm.  Someone's saying, were you talking about color forms?  Was color forms where you could, like, kind of change the look on things? 
[02:19:30]  Uh, color...  Well, color forms were, uh...  Nah, nah.  Color forms, you put the little people in the little towns and stuff like that.  I don't remember that one.  Yeah, I used to like putting color forms on my tongue and just hold them in my mouth.  I don't know why.  Yeah?  What, the little...  Yeah.  The little color form people?  Yeah, yeah.  You'd lay it in your...  Because it was, like, a good texture.  I don't remember those.  It was like...  It was like labia.  My brother, growing up, my brother, growing up, uh, wiped his ass with Candyland cards.  And then he would put them behind the heater. 
[02:20:00]  And then in the winter, my parents would freak out.  Why?  Yeah, that was good.  Yeah?  Well, why was it Candyland cards?  Because it was just the game that we had.  And speaking of games, fucking...  Oh.  Growing up, I would always have porns.  And, uh, my boy, I lent him a porno tape and he actually put it in the back of, like,  the game Sorry.  And then his mom took him to the beach and she brought board games and just totally bagged  them.  And she actually just took it out and he just fucking just told me right in the spot.  Right there.  Yeah.  You just, you just brought up a memory of how the fucking, uh, the games were set up.  Remember, it had that hidden panel. 
[02:20:30]  Right, right.  So that's where he had the porno.  Yeah.  Yep.  Remember, you kind of lift the box up and there was shit underneath?  Yeah, yeah.  Usually that's why you kept all your pieces and stuff.  But some, uh, some of my friends were keeping their fucking weed and stuff in there.  Yeah.  Keep your weed in it.  But your friend got caught because he had the porno in there.  Yeah, he got caught.  It was like Sorry or Clue or something.  Some shitty game that they're still selling.  Do you remember the game Clue?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They have actually a Mexican Clue and it's actually just one room. 
[02:21:00]  Nothing?  No, it's all right.  We're laughing.  It's all right.  We're laughing.  I like that one.  I'll go to the bathroom now.  We're laughing.  I'll go to the bathroom.  We like that one.  They are trying to still sell the same shitty board games.  And then they're, well, actually the iPad's making some of these games cool again.  Really?  Because it's kind of cool to play them on your iPad.  Yeah, but if you play too many fucking games, you have no social skills.  I mean, you've seen these kids who just game all the time.  Like my cousin, he's honestly, he's got the social skills of fucking Mr. Bean.  Yeah.  And he wears a headset.  Oh, he's one of the online guys. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Spends more time online than in the real world.  He really affects, like I see him like at Christmas and Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  And it clearly, it really affects what's going on with him.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  Yeah?  No, you talk.  No, no.  No, but I'm a headphone video game guy.  Not as much as I used to be, yeah.  But you talk for a living.  You're on point.  You don't understand.  Like he can't talk.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're talking about the guys that really spend most of their days online.  Like doing nothing else?  You're doing other shit.  Oh, okay.  You used to be that guy more than you are now.  Yeah, when I was married. 
[02:22:00]  Get away from my wife because I didn't want to talk to her.  So that was exactly why.  He lived in the virtual world.  It was a much better place.  Oh, it was so much better.  Yeah.  The world of half-life, death, destruction, aliens, soldiers that wanted to kill you was better  to me than marriage.  It was more peaceful and relaxing than marriage.  He would wear that headset just all day.  And it's ironic, too, because that's exactly what he's been wearing in like five years,  working at like Miami Subs, just a fucking headset. 
[02:22:30]  He can't talk.  He can't talk.  By the way, since the marriage did come up, I want to say best of luck to Dominic Barbara,  attorney at law.  Well, if you remember, I did bring up he got an 18-month suspension from being able to practice  law.  In misappropriation of funds, things as such.  Just things.  Yeah, the Bar Association said, take Ike, you're suspended for 18 months.  And he decided to take that opportunity to announce his retirement, that he will not be 
[02:23:00]  practicing law anymore.  He's retired as a lawyer.  So he can't fuck over any other guys out there.  Exactly.  Because he fucked you over.  Godspeed.  Way past.  Godspeed, fucko.  Way past what he was supposed to do for his car.  Oh, please.  It was fucking brutality.  Hated that.  That's my ex-wife's lawyer.  You got burned.  Oh, did I get burned?  I'm sorry, I don't know.  Don't bring it up, Colin. 
[02:23:30]  I won't.  Don't bring it up.  Back to that heavy metal.  That was more of a disaster.  Play that Japanese shit.  That was more of a disaster than what's going on in Japan.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Japan thinks nothing compared to what happened in that courtroom.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Wish you the best.  Yeah, so Dominic Barbara.  It's over for Anthony, finally.  Godspeed, cunt.  How many years?  Over 10, right?  Yeah.  Over 10.  You paid out over 10.  For a marriage that was less than that. 
[02:24:00]  That was nine years.  Yeah.  I paid an extra year.  So when you say, I'm done with this person, oh, no, the courts will tell you when you're  done.  Yeah.  It should be when you say you're done, you're done.  You shouldn't have any connection to that person.  In Anthony's case, his connection to the person was longer than the actual marriage.  Well, Dominic was just great at telling the judge how much the ex had to do with my career.  So yeah, I wouldn't have been where I am.  So if she was so terrific, can I ask you? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Well, what is she doing with these amazing skills of hers?  Not a clue.  Because she made you.  So you know how like these producers and stuff, they make one person and then when they're done  with that person, they're so skillful, they move on.  They can move on to the next project.  So she must be involved with just an amazing radio talent out there.  Oh, it must be.  Either that or some fucking biker.  Who the hell knows?  Just clinging on the back of a hog.  Someone's old lady, I guess.  I have no idea.  I hear tell. 
[02:25:00]  I don't fucking know.  What do I know?  Good for her.  Good.  Good.  Have fun.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Yeah, I know.  Believe me, I would love to.  We try not to bring this up too much.  That's all I've heard.  It's like, no, but when you're with someone, last time I was in here, my girlfriend actually  fucking dumped me the day before I came in on my last appearance.  Oh, man.  Were you bummed?  Is that why you were so bad last time?  Oh, dude, I was awful.  No, dude.  I'm fucking with you.  No, I deserve that, man.  I deserve, I fucking just, fucking just. 
[02:25:30]  That was a joke, dude.  The retarded kid in the corner.  I was awful.  No, you were fine.  No, listen, but.  You gave me an opportunity.  But the thing is, when you say, when you're with someone, you want them to be happy with or without  you, and then they break up with you, and then you want them to be happy, just not just  yet.  No.  Just, you know.  No, no, you don't want to break up with you either.  She actually, this is a pretty fucking crazy story.  She had, she's always been with guys growing up, and she needed to be by herself, so I  was like, cool, I respect that.  And then I was like, listen, I care about you, I could stay with you, and she had some 
[02:26:00]  problems, I could help you, you know, go through this.  You were going to be a helper?  Listen, listen, listen, listen, no, no, let me finish, let me finish.  I said to her, I'm not going to fix your problems, but I like you and I care about you,  and I'll see if I can help you.  She goes, I can't be with you, I have to be alone, I can't date anybody.  Two months later, I go to TMZ.com, she's on the front cover with Jim Carrey.  Oh.  Your chick is the one, what?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  This was a couple months ago, not the one he's dating now, but this was like four months  ago.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, she left you for Jim Carrey? 
[02:26:30]  I don't know, it's TMZ, so their job is to manipulate anything, but it's just.  But it's the same girl you used to be with?  The girl that I was dating, yeah.  Holy shit, can we take a look at her?  Yeah.  Was she the Asian one?  No, no, no.  It's not going to hurt, is it, to look at?  No, no, it's not going to hurt.  Oh, okay.  Shit.  Ow.  Have you, you've rebounded?  Uh, yeah, and dunked.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay, good, good.  Can you give us a name or something?  Whisper it to Danny so we can see what she looks like?  Yeah.  Let me, uh.  I definitely want the picture with her, with Jim Carrey, just to make it hurt a little 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, I would like to see that.  I'm really glad I'm here, guys.  Oh, shit.  That one?  Yeah, yeah.  Where she's making out with him?  Oh, God.  They are really like fucking...  Where he's laying down on a couch in some club.  When he's knuckle deep at Tao.  Oh, his putt is turgid in that picture, and your ex is like, frolicking on him.  You want to hear a crazy story, actually, how I found this?  Oh, she was, she's fucking hot, dude.  She is, but you know what, man? 
[02:27:30]  That don't mean shit, dude.  I've learned...  Ah, that's a good way to rationalize it.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure that makes you sleep better at night.  Listen, you want to hear the crazy story?  It's not everything, dude.  No, not at all, I'm sure.  Listen, I want to share a crazy story real quick, how this came about.  You think he's got a heart on in that picture?  She's looking at it.  I don't know.  Oh, she is looking at it in the butt picture.  She is.  How did it come about?  How did she...  No, no.  My actually, my friend Josh Accardo, he's a comedian.  He's very funny.  You guys should check him out.  He's really funny.  He loves chicks' asses. 
[02:28:00]  He's like an ass guy, and like, he was at work one day, and he  saw a chick's ass on TMZ, and he wanted to go home later on the night  just to check it out.  And he stumbled across this, and he recognized her.  He's the only friend who met her.  So what are the chances of my one friend finding this and then calling me?  Otherwise, I don't go to TMZ.com.  I don't care about that shit.  You never would have known about this.  And for a reason, I had to see that.  And it was random how it came about.  And there he is.  Wow.  Yeah.  Jim Carrey with your ex.  Yeah.  What was her...  Jim Carrey rebounds and scores with Hot Brunette. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  With Hot Brunette.  I mean, what pissed me off the most, though, is that she's just, you know, she's so caught  up in that scene.  If you saw that guy in the subway, she wouldn't talk to him.  She's clearly with him because of who he is, and I don't want to be with anyone like  that.  That's fucking whack.  That's another great rationalization.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're justifying left and right.  So I guess your taste now are people that are good on the inside, even if they're big  fat pigs and shit like that.  That's what I do.  That's where you are now.  You're a big fat pig.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:29:00]  That doesn't know who you are.  You know, you've grown.  That doesn't care about your comedy.  You've grown.  That's good.  That's great.  You've learned from this.  I like hooking up with, like, ugly chicks.  I do because, like, I bring them back to my place because I'm not, like, big yet,  and, like, they say anything about my place.  Like, this is your place?  I'm like, look at your stomach.  Exactly.  Exactly.  It gives you a little bit more power, a little more juice.  You know, are you serious?  I hear you.  Ten minutes, I'm not going to kiss you, turn the lights off.  Yeah, no fucking, no games, no bullshit.  But, in terms of anything, you know that some really pretty girls, obviously, yeah, but 
[02:29:30]  you could not be with a chick who's just hot all the time.  You can't.  You're a smart guy.  You can't.  It's rough, right?  Come on.  What?  What happened?  What are you talking about now?  Where are we?  What?  So, what is the ex doing now?  Jim Carrey's not with her.  Mostly black dudes.  Mostly black dudes.  She moved on from Jim Carrey to black dudes.  I don't know what she's doing.  Jim Carrey's not with her.  The spiritual, the complete thing to do is to pray for the person and move on. 
[02:30:00]  You think Jim Carrey, yeah?  Definitely, yeah.  Yeah.  I would think so.  But then again, their job is to take those pictures.  What hurt me most is that she just lied.  She's a fake person.  Ah, she said that she wanted to be alone.  How are you going to tell me that you've got to take care of yourself and then this?  Let's call her now.  I don't ever sell.  I want to be alone.  I mean, would Jim Carrey alone.  She did call me.  Like, all the correspondence after she broke up with me was all on her part.  And then actually, she fucking called me up.  And I picked up the phone.  I didn't recognize her number because I deleted it.  I'm like, hello?  And she's like, hey. 
[02:30:30]  I'm like, who's this?  Click.  She just, I guess just, I didn't have her number.  So she just, yeah.  Whatever.  Well, got a few of those.  Now we're depressed.  No.  It's actually, it's not depressing.  That's a good thing.  Yeah.  It's a good thing, right?  You're out of that.  Yeah.  No fucking problems with the...  Colin was in Norway and Germany.  I want to hear about that.  Yeah.  German, Norway knows what's up.  They get a lot of the funny.  But Germany, I don't think they know what humor is.  I follow you on Twitter. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  And I like you on Twitter, but I was really frustrated by your Norway trip because you didn't have  many pictures of the broads.  Yeah.  You had a lot of pictures of yourself.  No pictures with broads.  I do have pictures.  Actually, I have to show you on my phone.  I'll tell you what.  I'll post one after the show for you and I'll tweet you.  All right.  What's your take on Norway and where else were you?  Germany?  I was in Germany.  I did a USO tour.  We did a big show for the troops in Germany.  Yeah.  That was really badass.  That was huge. 
[02:31:30]  I didn't know what to expect because it was for the staff and the nurses and doctors who  take care of the soldiers and some soldiers.  It wasn't like I was in some airplane hangar with 4,000 troops saying, pussy, and the place  goes crazy.  It was actually a little different.  You had to work a little harder than that.  So here we have all these smart doctors, and I'm up there talking about my taint at 10  o'clock at night, and they're just like, but I crushed.  And I actually set the tone for the rest of the show.  Good for you.  And honestly, they've seen a lot more bombs, so it's totally ... You like that one at 
[02:32:00]  the end?  That is good.  That was pretty good.  That is good.  No one fucking laughed when I said that.  Well, I was taking it literally.  Because the world is ...  I'm being like, you're right.  The world is crumbling.  Anthony's like, yeah, Colin.  Yeah.  Because they have seen many bombs.  It's tragic.  But behind your head, you see the collapse of the world going on.  Maybe we should turn off the TV.  See, that's a nuclear explosion as you're doing your own bomb there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good ... Are they still playing the same explosions?  Yeah, of course they are.  Evacuation order within 50 miles.  50 miles now.  They just showed a video of the helicopter trying to drop that water, and like you said ... 
[02:32:30]  It looks goofy.  It's stupid.  It's going everywhere but where it's supposed to be.  It's actually a dolphin they're trying to save in it.  There's no water.  Oh, yeah.  They are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, that's the opposite.  Yeah.  You just nailed me on that one.  Yeah.  The Japanese, not too good with the dolphins.  They're probably trying to figure out how they could get dolphins to fix their nuclear  plant.  How they could get them to swim in there.  I'm just saying there's some people that have seen the cove, and they're not as upset  as others about what's happening over there.  Oh, really?  That's all I'm saying.  Who?  Yeah.  There's people. 
[02:33:00]  That you know, personally?  What do they say the radiation ...  They're saying this could be payback for what they do to dolphins.  Oh, oh, I got you.  I'm just trying to be a little vague.  Does karma work with fucking ...  Because I don't want to be swept up in that tsunami because that could get you fired.  But there were some people saying, well, look how you treat the dolphins.  See what happens?  Dolphins.  I don't know.  The ocean scares the shit out of me.  What I love, too, is that you ever talk to somebody, they're like, yeah, I respect the  ocean.  Really?  I piss in it every time I'm there.  How about you guys?  Every time.  Every time. 
[02:33:30]  Who's getting out to take a piss?  I respect it, but I piss in it.  Yes.  That's an easy one, but I pee in people's pools, their hot tubs.  I don't know.  Fuck.  I ain't getting out of a fucking ...  Is that radiation?  I don't know.  I don't want to know.  What do they say the radiation is actually going to affect them in like 10 years?  What do they say that's going to happen?  Two-headed babies.  Really?  Things like that.  Yeah, this is as bad as it gets for that area.  Water heads.  That area will be off limits for forever now, I guess, or for very long ... How many years,  is it?  10,000.  For the whole area?  Yeah.  For the whole world. 
[02:34:00]  No, no, no.  Help me out.  Help me out.  You're an expert.  So this plan is fucked.  Yeah.  So how far is it fucked for and how long?  I don't think anybody knows yet.  You've got to see if ...  Well, what are they doing in Chernobyl?  Are you allowed to walk around the Chernobyl area?  No.  Chernobyl is just fucked.  No.  For how many miles?  I'm not sure how many miles, but for ...  Does anyone know?  For the foreseeable future, no one's going to be doing anything.  I understand that.  No one's riding that Ferris wheel.  I understand that, but when they contain it with the cement and stuff, like you're going  to do with Chernobyl, then what happens? 
[02:34:30]  How close can you get?  Oh, I don't think very close.  No, I think you've got to stay.  You can get fairly close.  I think they have radiation tests.  Actually, I saw a documentary.  20 miles?  Some dude actually went ... I can't think of the guy's name, but he actually went, and  his radiation level was through the roof, and he was testing each step he took, how  high it would go, and it was pretty intense.  It was some documentary that I ...  Why would he do that?  Uh, it's the whole show ... It's the whole show idea where they do bad-ass shit.  Like, that's like ...  They do bad-ass shit?  I can't think of it.  It's not Thrillist. 
[02:35:00]  It's, uh ...  How bad do you want to be famous?  That you just ...  Kill yourself.  Yeah.  Decide to do that.  But you know that people will do anything.  But he's actually a smart dude.  I can't think of his name.  Not that smart.  Yeah.  Wow.  But I think he was in a suit or something.  This guy's surprised they said I pee in people's ...  Yeah.  But people don't want to hear that story anymore.  I might have played that story out.  Anthony, you know this.  You know this.  You know what's fucked up is that ...  Say you got a pool at your house.  Yeah.  You got a nice pool.  I know that.  Say you're away.  Some dude breaks in your backyard, falls in your pool.  He can sue you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I know.  I think that's right.  Yeah, they can.  That's just ...  It's ridiculous.  That's why you're supposed to have alarms on your gates and everything.  There's codes that you have to have alarms on your gates.  I just don't know if that makes me ...  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, why are you there?  Well, we live in a world where you can sue for anything now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's completely acceptable.  I'd probably go and find him, right?  Yeah.  In the pool.  Yeah.  And be like, fuck.  Pull him out.  Throw him in my house.  Shoot him.  Yeah.  And say he was breaking it.  That's what I'd do. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  I was in a ...  Why are his lungs filled with water?  Did you shoot someone underwater?  Well, Mythbusters did it.  It's very difficult.  It's very hard.  Actually, smaller caliber weapons fare better.  They go a little deeper than larger caliber.  How long does a gun survive underwater?  Oh, you mean shoot the entire gun underwater?  Wow.  Is that even possible?  The Mythbusters are two homos in a garage in Oceanside.  Yeah, they are.  Don't look to your right.  The biggest myth is to see if they're homos. 
[02:36:30]  He's got a beret, his goatee.  I'll go for it.  Why are you telling me no?  Who's behind me?  Is he behind me?  Is he behind me?  What, you're a big fan?  Huge fan.  Of course.  I'm a big fan.  They're smart dudes, but they're just weird.  Come on.  They're playing with fucking two liters in a garage.  They're kind of whatever.  We think the American pickers are gay because they have beards and hats.  No.  First of all, it's not a beard.  It's a fucking red goatee, and I think it's a beret.  So you've got to be specific.  It's not just a hat.  Well, these guys are from San Francisco.  That's what it is.  Oh, boy.  Exactly.  So I'm just saying.  It's not just gays. 
[02:37:00]  That's the mentality out there.  Everybody's a little eclectic and different.  Sure.  I think their next experiment should be why you like them.  It would be a pretty easy science experiment, I think.  I mean, what's the hypothesis?  Yeah.  The conclusion is going to be I still like the show.  For what it is, yeah.  It's cool, but I'd rather watch something else.  You know?  Okay.  Like my pubes grow in my backyard.  Oh.  Why aren't you a fan of Mythbusters?  I crack jokes.  We all like experiments.  Yeah.  I'd rather watch, if anything, I like Locked Up Abroad. 
[02:37:30]  Real life shit.  Of course.  Well, that's good.  Not to say that Mythbusters isn't real.  Not that real life shit like science.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  You're going to nail me with the smarts.  Uh-oh.  Fuck that fairytale shit.  Fuck that fairytale, yeah.  I want to watch me some Locked Up Abroad.  Yeah.  Well, how about I put Mentos and Diet Pepsi and fucking watch it rocket in the air?  That wasn't them.  It was because of the idiots all around the country that were obsessed with that shit for so long.  It had to come to the forefront.  Yeah.  I'm really glad you're here today.  Awkward.  No problem.  It's not awkward.  Awkward. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, they're saying that they're going to start offering tours of Chernobyl.  They say the radiation levels are gone and want to use it for tours.  Good luck.  Is that possible?  I don't know.  I don't think the radiation's gone.  They're doing it this year.  Really?  Yeah.  Like official tours.  Like unofficially, people have been bringing people into Chernobyl for a long time.  They have like wolves that mutate.  I've seen that.  I bet they can't go to like the actual plant and walk over the cement encased fucking core. 
[02:38:30]  I mean, I'd like to just buy my ex-girlfriend an all-inclusive expanse, like, you know, trip there for the weekend.  It's just a little getaway.  I think that'll be good.  The Jim Carrey one?  For like...  Yeah, that one.  I remembered that one.  For like six months.  Fucking dick.  The Jim Carrey one?  Right on top of the fucking reactor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  I was going to...  Oh, yeah.  What were we just talking about?  Let me bring up Mythbusters again.  A gun...  No, do it.  I know.  Stop.  A gun underwater. 
[02:39:00]  Thank you.  Yes.  I'm thinking there'd be too much back pressure.  You might do some damage.  Like, if you could take the gun, put it underwater, and fire it real quick before anything gets wet,  like the bullet or the primer, it would probably fire, but the water in the barrel would make  a lot of resistance that I don't think it's made to take, and it might blow the fucking  breach up.  Even if you had the opportunity to fire that weapon underwater, I'm thinking it wouldn't  probably...  It wouldn't get very far under the water.  No, I don't think it would either.  Why hasn't Mythbusters done this one? 
[02:39:30]  They should.  They sort of did.  They did bullets into water.  From outside.  I want the whole gun in the water.  I think you might have a fucking catastrophic failure of the breach, because it's almost  like plugging the barrel up.  Yeah, wouldn't it be, in essence, almost like a lot of the pressure of whatever you  were in, like whatever water pressure...  You know, if you were in like an Olympic-sized pool, wouldn't it be all of the water of that  pool pushing against?  Yeah, and then just the resistance of the water itself, regardless of the depth of the  water, but like the water itself, the bullet would have a hard time cutting through  it in the barrel. 
[02:40:00]  Basic five-foot pool.  So it would...  Kidney-shaped.  I don't know.  Preferably.  I don't know.  The bullet would fire.  It would.  People are saying it would fire.  The bullet would fire, but I don't know if I think that might blow up.  Would it fall out of the gun like premature ejaculation?  It probably...  No, I think the gun would fail.  I think you should set up...  I should do this.  Can you shoot guns in your backyard?  Underwater.  Yeah.  I think underwater I could.  I think we got ourselves our next experiment. 
[02:40:30]  Next experiment in the pool.  What do you think?  You could shoot it underwater?  I have no idea.  What do you think?  I would get so arrested.  We got a target right here.  Come on.  What do you think?  I would never.  What's the...  What do they say on this?  It says, can you fire a gun underwater?  What's the answer?  Yeah.  What's the answer?  Well, Tiana.  What is she?  Tiana H.  Tiana.  She's dancing on Friday.  With the African-American avatar.  Yeah, yeah.  Says, yeah, you can.  That's it. 
[02:41:00]  So then...  But the bullet, not going to go as fast.  Here you go.  Source.  Movies.  Really?  Oh, damn, yo.  That's the best answer we could get?  And the best answer was chosen by the asker.  Really?  Great.  Well, we need to know for real.  It's on YouTube.  Well, how about stop being an e-rock and give me more than it's on YouTube?  What is that?  Google it.  Google it.  That's a Japanese...  That was a Japanese band music video? 
[02:41:30]  That looks like Fifth Avenue in about an hour.  You see that?  Yeah, that is going to be.  I'm a green puke.  Yeah, right?  Very good.  I saw a couple on the way in today.  Vomit hopscotch.  Oh, that's funny.  And when you're walking down the street.  Just absolute messes.  Yeah.  It's going to be drunk fest out there.  Pig olas out there right now.  Foul.  Pig olas.  Just some...  Messes.  Shooting a Glock underwater.  All right?  Is this the...  All right, let's...  All right, all right.  Enough with the fucking effect.  Let's just go with it. 
[02:42:00]  All right, let's see what happens here.  All right, let's do this.  Question.  Will a Glock shoot underwater, and how far does the bullet travel?  All right, that's good.  So far, so good.  Question, answer.  All right, the gun's firing.  I bet it's not even hitting that target.  It's not.  It looks like a piece of glass underwater, maybe?  It looks like the bullets just fell.  They just have to be immediately stopped.  And now they're looking for the bullets. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, they just fell on the...  Oh, my God, they fell like six feet in front of the gun.  Still a two-inch group.  He's bragging about his grouping on the floor of the pool.  It didn't...  Well, okay.  So that solves that.  Travels about two feet before losing complete velocity underwater.  More videos that...  I like that.  Sorry for you.  No plug.  I'd like to see something with a little more mass, though.  Yeah.  See what happens then.  That's kind of weird, though. 
[02:43:00]  Would you stand in front of that under the water?  Absolutely.  You would?  Yeah.  With no protection?  No.  Would you stand two feet in front of the gun?  No.  I'll stand two and a half feet in front of the gun.  Two and a half feet in front of the gun?  Wow.  Two and a half feet.  That's ballsy, man.  Even though I just saw that experiment, I don't think I could do that.  I know.  That would be very scary.  I mean, for a bullet to actually go through...  Like, for that nine millimeter to...  Let's say I was standing ten feet away from that gun.  I mean, it just wouldn't happen.  Physics would not allow that to happen.  It would kind of scary still, though, wouldn't it?  Well, hell yeah.  It's scary to be facing a gun.  See, that would be the video they should do now that they know that the bullet's only  going to go two feet. 
[02:43:30]  Oh my God, that would be scary, though.  Have a guy standing six, seven feet away.  You want a fucking viral video.  That's going to work.  I think the higher the caliber, the worse the bullet will fare.  You're looking at more resistance.  The more resistance, it might break up more, but I think you'd have more chance of shrapnel  actually hitting your target.  But at what speed?  It would have to be a huge load, right?  I mean, it would have to be a gigantic amount of force behind it.  I think that would defeat the purpose.  Well, we need to...  I know, we need to do this.  Go back to Mythbusters.  Dr. Steve says, apparently, you can go to the town, Chernobyl, but not to the reactor 
[02:44:00]  site.  Radiation not gone, but low enough for a brief visit.  And then he says, if you trust some post-Soviet tourism asshole...  Yeah, of course.  Who's desperate for tourist dollars.  Yeah, no, it is completely safe.  Fuck that.  We go to Chernobyl, we can take you to the reactor, everything.  There is no radiation.  You go by yourself, I wait here and collect your money.  No, I think it's still a little dangerous.  So Japan's going to be fucked for a long time to come.  I don't know, it all depends on what they're doing with this shit. 
[02:44:30]  Well, they're doing nothing.  If it's still a bubbling mass of nuclear material, or if it's still in rods, that can be removed  and put somewhere, who knows?  All right, here's an asshole.  Is the show called Danger Zone?  The one I was talking about?  No, it was...  Fuck.  I can't think of the name.  It wasn't Danger Zone.  I know that.  Chris in New Hampshire, what do you got on this?  What do you got?  Yeah, there's a show called Cooking in the Danger Zone, and they sent the host to right 
[02:45:00]  on the outskirts of Chernobyl, and he basically had a lunch with this ancient couple that  lived there, and pretty much, they tested him for radiation afterwards, and they found  that he had elevated levels, and they said, you kind of worked that off over time, but  of course, he had the test done in Russia, so...  Ah, in Russia, who knows?  Can't trust Russia.  I mean, they were just all kinds of wine and all kinds of crazy stuff.  Yeah, that's just fucked up. 
[02:45:30]  Ghost Hunters did a show from Chernobyl?  Let's go to Travis in Kentucky.  Travis?  Yeah, I think it was the Ghost Hunters, one of the ghost hunting shows.  They actually did a show and went into Chernobyl, and the footage is actually pretty fucking  amazing.  I mean, the school, I mean, all the paperwork still stood on the desk and everything.  It's amazing what they could do in Hollywood.  You don't think they really went, huh?  It's probably just a warehouse in, like, Jersey.  Green screen.  I mean, it showed footage of them walking around in the city, so I don't know. 
[02:46:00]  Look at those houses.  That would be kind of creepy to walk around and...  Oh, is that supposed to be a ghost?  Is that a ghost in the window?  Do they find ghosts?  I don't like pictures of ghosts.  Ghosts?  They scare me.  They said they found ghosts, but it was actually the radiation was screwing up their equipment  is what they were looking at.  Yeah, that's probably what it is.  You take a picture and it's...  You ever go to...  Oh, no, you're not a Western New York guy.  We used to go to Love Canal.  Oh, yeah, Love Canal.  Is that near Mount Airy Lodge?  Mount Airy Lodge, right.  It was.  They shut that down. 
[02:46:30]  Outside Buffalo, where they shut down an entire town, and it's creepy.  You still see kids' bikes, and the roads are all, like, grown in, and people just abandoned  their houses and pretty much left everything.  Wow.  What was that about?  They've discovered a...  That toxic waste dump...  Yeah, I forgot the exact story.  They built a whole development dump.  This was a long time ago.  Great.  I don't know what they're doing with that area anymore.  I think they started, like, rebuilding and saying everything's okay, and families actually  went for it.  Yeah, they did.  I think that was the last update.  They had a big cleanup and shit. 
[02:47:00]  And there's still an area, though, that is, like, off limits to...  But that was kind of cool.  They got webbed toes.  It was kind of cool to drive through that shit, though.  It was cool to drive through that shit.  Yeah, it looks like anything ghost town-y is good.  Where's the other place?  Is it Kings Park?  The old psych...  Oh, Kings Park Psychiatric Center.  That's cool, too.  What was that crazy one in Staten Island?  Remember that one with Geraldo, Geraldo?  Oh, yeah, Willowbrook.  Yeah, that was, like...  Yeah.  But getting to go to some of these places where they just abandoned and left is really cool.  The one in Kings Park, yeah, the sidewalks have little trees now growing out of them, 
[02:47:30]  but they still have the light poles and posts and some of the structures, I was going to say.  I was going to say houses, but they're not really houses.  They're like buildings.  They're institutional buildings.  Thank you, yeah.  Looks like a video game set.  Where now they have a huge tree just growing right through the fucking thing?  Yeah.  You've done that tour, right?  Illegally.  After a few road sodas?  Roads.  Road sodas.  Road sodas?  We used to call them road sodas.  What, beers? 
[02:48:00]  The only reason I'm...  What's road beer?  Yeah.  Road sodas?  I like that.  The only reason I'm bringing this up is...  The worst is when...  I admitted this yesterday, and I got killed on Twitter, so I'm going to continue.  Road sodas.  When I was a fucking...  That's great.  When I was a high school douchebag, we used to go, hey, man, let's get some road sodas.  You ever drink it when you're drinking in a car on a road trip, and then you got to go  to the bathroom?  That's just the worst, you know?  What are you...  Just trying to take a dump into it, like a Molson bottle, going like 70?  Oh, a dump.  I'm kidding. 
[02:48:30]  You like that switcheroo?  Huh?  I see.  I thought you...  I gotcha.  I thought you were going to talk piss, and you talked a dump.  You know?  One, two.  That's my knockout.  One, two.  Fucking...  I didn't see it coming.  Snapple...  That's what it is.  Snapple bottles were made for fucking taking leaks on the road, man.  Yeah, the wide mouth.  Of course.  Nothing scarier than knowing you're going to run out of room.  Oh, those Snapple facts.  And you remember those Snapple facts, though?  I'm sure you remember one that you...  Oh, under the plan.  You remember one?  Yeah.  Of course.  No.  I don't remember any of them.  No, I would never read those things.  There was this homeless dude down on West 3rd Street, and he was collecting bottles. 
[02:49:00]  It's a true story.  And he had tons of Sprite cans and Snapples, and he tried to, like, get money, so he's  reading the Snapple facts.  He's like, did you know, like, the Hawaiian alphabet has, like, five letters?  I'm like, do you know that your feet look like driftwood?  And then I just walked away.  That'll show him.  That will get him.  You really showed him.  Isn't it great how I put down homeless people?  Isn't that great?  That's good.  I talk about shit jokes, and I put down homeless people.  I actually respect that, because I do some things with homeless people, and that's...  It's well-received. 
[02:49:30]  I do things with homeless people.  You know what I did on Christmas Day?  What'd you do?  I handed out my expired credit cards and told them to go crazy!  That'll love.  They're not easy targets, is what I was going to say.  You don't know what you're getting when you fucking walk up to these guys.  I've walked up to enough of them.  Some angry ones.  They walk up to you.  You just said you walked up to them.  They walk up to you.  I walk up to them.  Oh, he walks up to them.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah, you do.  To be smarty pants.  I got this bit I'm developing called Homeless Roulette. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know about this one.  I've seen a couple of...  You walk up to them and hope for the best.  Hope they don't fucking scratch your eyes out.  The best part...  Anthony, you know this.  You know when you're out in the street or whatever, and you're talking to somebody,  and a homeless dude comes up, and you see him coming, and automatically you know  what to say to him.  I'm like, yeah, I got no money.  And then you turn back to your friend, and then you pause for like three seconds, like  what's he going to say?  Yeah, is this going to fucking ignite?  Yeah.  Is this guy going to fucking go ballistic on me?  Yeah.  Or the best thing to do is when you see a homeless dude on the corner, and you're walking with  your friend, you ask him to see his watch, and then you're holding it, and then you drop  it in the dude's cup, and you keep walking. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, shit.  That's a dick move.  Because then he's got to go back in.  He's got the watch.  Wow, that's fucking mean.  Yeah, it's funny.  That's good.  That's good to do to a friend.  Try getting your tag back from, you know.  There are actually videos on YouTube, tourists in Chernobyl.  Can we see one of those?  Really?  Tourists in Chernobyl.  How bad do you want to fucking see the world?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  How was Norway?  Norway.  It was a huge success.  It was my second time.  I don't care about the comedy part. 
[02:51:00]  I would assume that you were-  Just shut me up.  No, because I would assume you're funny.  You went over there, you know.  Yeah.  You were funny for those people, of course.  Yeah.  So that is a given.  But I'm talking about, like, the culture, and what did you take in from there?  Overall, I mean, obviously, every time I travel, I learn something.  The way of life there, it's just calm.  It's peaceful.  They're happier.  You can see it.  I mean, you get off the plane here in New York or Jersey, it just smacks you in the face  when you land.  You guys know that.  But, like, there, everything's cleaner, nicer.  It's just, it's relaxing. 
[02:51:30]  But being a New Yorker, it makes you uncomfortable when you fly somewhere else and everyone's  so nice.  You're, immediately, you think, what the fuck do they want?  Yeah.  That they're this nice.  They want something out of me.  Why are you so nice?  What do you want?  Let's cut to the chase.  Yeah.  But they're just being nice, which is hard to understand when you live in this shithole.  And the girls, yeah.  Like I said, the girls there, they're absolutely stunning.  I mean, they're ridiculous.  But it's just so the norm there.  I mean, when everyone talks about, they always say girls from Sweden.  I've been to both places.  I toured both, Sweden and Norway, and Norway definitely for me. 
[02:52:00]  They're just fucking beautiful.  Do they give up where the poo comes out?  They're actually, they're shy.  So, like, you got to, once you talk to them, they're cool.  But, like, as a culture, they're a little reserved.  Really?  Like, they wouldn't walk up to you at the bar and be like, hey, listen, I want you to  leave with me right now.  So.  You put up numbers over there or what?  Yeah.  Got some numbers up there.  Yeah.  Putting up numbers means, you know, you're fucking slamming.  What did you think I fucking met?  Getting actual numbers.  No.  What?  Come on, dude.  So, it was, I was in, like, seven different cities. 
[02:52:30]  Obviously, Oslo.  Oslo's the big one.  Went to all different cities.  You know, trains.  Where's the drop-off after the second city?  What do you mean the drop-off?  Meaning, like, you know, in the United States, we got probably ten solid cities, and then the  cities drop off after that.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Oslo is the big city.  And then the second one is probably pretty cool.  And then after that, there's a drop-off of what, how impressive the cities are.  Yeah, it was a little bit of, you know, the Stavanger, or Stavanger, I can't pronounce  it that well, but that was, like, the best show, man. 
[02:53:00]  The people there, they get, English is their second language, so they get, and I'm performing  for young, hip kids.  I mean, they know what's up, and they, it's.  Why don't us pompous Americans have a second language in general?  Why do we have that?  Everywhere else you go, like, they have a second language that you understand.  Yeah.  We're the only country that doesn't really have that.  I know, but yet we're the first ones to make fun of everybody.  True.  I mean, look at Mexicans.  A lot of Mexicans, they speak English.  I mean, I make fun of Mexicans jokingly.  I lie with nothing against them, but they speak English and Spanish.  But we don't need a second language. 
[02:53:30]  By the way, you know the saying, me casa, tu casa?  My house is your house?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's ironic that it's actually, I'm Spanish-Mexican, because literally, their house is my house,  because they all live together.  And I just set up that joke for about three minutes, and Opie just fucking, Opie just  fucking, Opie just fucking, Opie fucking put his, fucking laugh.  We weren't even talking about, just fucking, let me feel good so I can leave, dude.  We weren't even talking about houses, though.  I gotta fucking throw in a joke or two.  Anthony just looked at me, and then looked at his iPhone.  It's fucking phenomenal.  I know. 
[02:54:00]  Don't take that seriously.  No, the computer is so screwing up right now.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  Yeah, I hate when that happens, when Colin's here.  Fucking dick.  It's totally fucking up.  Fuck you.  It's Windows.  It's Windows.  It's Windows.  No response.  Really?  You click on a fucking thing, and you get no response.  That's the worst.  Anthony does his computer upgrades every day.  Don't worry about it, Colin.  Is that what it is?  Yes.  But he goes through this whole thing every day.  He needs to get his upgrades in.  Yeah, I gotta upgrades in.  It's not me. 
[02:54:30]  He's upgrading software right now.  Don't take it personally.  Don't take it personally.  He does it every day.  My antivirus has to, I really need to get it done.  I'm a stickler for a good antivirus.  Yeah.  It said.  All right.  Listen, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, we got Tiger Woods shit.  Tiger Woods farting, and Jimmy Fallon, thanks, Tiger Woods.  And more with Colin Cain.  Colin Cain on Twitter with the K, right?  Yeah, it's Colin, C-O-L-I-N-K-A-N-E.  Colin Cain.  Very nice.  Oh, I get it. 
[02:55:00]  For St. Paddy's Day?  Yeah.  I see E-Rock's wearing the green shirt today.  E-Rock looking very festive, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  None of us could be bothered, but E-Rock.  Wearing the green proud today, E-Rock.  I figured since I didn't wear red for Japan on Monday, I might as well do this. 
[02:55:30]  Was there a wear red for Japan on Monday?  Yeah, we talked about that.  Oh, you're right, right, right.  Somebody was trying to get that going on Twitter.  It felt miserable.  Yeah, that didn't work very well.  I didn't see many red shirts.  I think it was for Monday.  E-Rock, what do you think of the big Opie and Anthony St. Paddy's Day broadcast we're doing?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Keeping with the theme all morning, right?  Oh, yeah.  I wish we had some Guinness in here.  So do I.  Oof.  I got to hit that.  I'm in a bad situation, though, because it's St. Paddy's Day, right? 
[02:56:00]  I don't have to drive.  I'm going to that Imus thing, Kiss Me, I'm Imus thing at the Hard Rock, and I'll probably have a couple of beers or road sodas, as I like to call them.  Thank you.  Well, what did you call them growing up?  And don't say beers.  I did.  Road sodas.  I just called them beers.  Let's get some beers.  Colin, what did you call them?  Just beers.  I mean, road sodas.  Come on.  Road sodas.  We all thought we were cool.  Sometimes we reference the beer by its name. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, Buds.  Like, want to go get some Red Dogs?  Millers.  Yeah.  Because it's 1992.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Strohs.  But growing up, white people, they'll drink anywhere.  I mean, growing up, you can't drink in bars when you're young.  I used to just sit on, like, the side of people's garages and have, like, 12 Natty Lights and just finger a girl.  And my life was just pure.  Oh, would that be great?  Like, back then, would you, like, just hanging out?  Not a worry in the world.  You have a road soda in your left hand?  Road soda.  Road soda in hand, yeah.  Finger popping some broad from Bayshore. 
[02:57:00]  Smoking your fucking...  Right?  I would be smoking those camel fucking Reds.  Those new camel Reds.  Really?  Yeah.  We used to smoke...  Finger popping.  We used to smoke the shitty cigars.  Cigars?  Yeah, the White Owls or whatever the fuck they were called.  Pink Tip White Owl.  The White Owls.  You smoked those?  Yeah, we did.  Without anything, with the original blend inside?  Yeah.  After our road sodas.  Road sodas?  I think in the yearbook, you know when it says likes and stuff?  Oh, you didn't put road sodas. 
[02:57:30]  I think I...  I got a look, but I think I wrote, you know, likes, you know, having road sodas with my buds.  Oh, God damn it.  Wow.  That's brutal.  Now, one person's going to admit they called their beer something else.  I've never heard road soda.  No, it was the first time.  Yeah.  I guess I did a lot of traveling.  I heard Wobbly Pops.  Wobbly Pops.  I have a couple of Wobbly Pops.  Yeah, Wobbly Pops is a good one.  But I don't use that.  Someone else uses that.  Have you ever had some?  Yeah, Wobbly Pops is good.  That's...  Is that better than road sodas? 
[02:58:00]  Anything's better than road sodas.  Why?  It was code.  I don't know.  What kind of code is that?  That's terrible.  In case parents were around.  Oh.  They couldn't figure it out?  It's like, hey, Rob, go get some road sodas.  What's a road soda?  Ah, just a few Pepsis, Mom.  Oh, gosh.  We're going, you know, to the NASA Coliseum to see Foghat.  Ah, Foghat.  We're going to the Black and Blue Tour.  Someone says, all right, date for Philly.  He goes, okay.  I used to call them roadies. 
[02:58:30]  Roadies?  Roadies.  Barley pop.  See?  Well, here...  See, where we were getting there, where I was getting quickly, I'll finish.  I have a lot of time in between now, and it's St. Paddy's Day, and I can drink, but then  I've got to do Hannity tonight, and I don't want to do Sean Hannity's show, Drunk Off My  Ass, although that could be very funny.  It is a live program.  You don't have self-control like that.  You're fucked.  I know.  I really like drinking. 
[02:59:00]  But although, unless, you know, I'm doing a live from the compound and I'm home, I think  I'm pretty level-headed after a few beers.  I'll do a few.  I'll do a few.  Loosen up a little.  Yeah, yeah.  And then do Sean Hannity.  All I've got to do is, like, oh, that Obama, oh, he, oh, what he doesn't do.  Meh.  That's it.  I'm good.  All right.  There's a few people on board with the road sodas.  Thank God.  Yeah, you should eat.  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  I had some road sodas, Sean.  Road sodas.  And he's going to be like, what are you talking about?  Road sodas.  You know, the things that Obama drank when he got in trouble for saying stuff about that  cop and had the road soda summit in the back of the White House?  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Road sodas.  Road sodas.  What's some of those other road sodas?  They drink pretty good.  Well. 
[03:00:00]  Boy, wow.  Red dog.  Red dog.  I love that man to this day.  Meister brow.  Drunk Anthony and Hannity equals epic and viral, they're saying.  Could be.  You should do it.  All right.  Let's see if anyone could tell if I'm drunk and if I am, how drunk I am and point out  every slurred word.  Okay.  Because I got to tell you, I'm pretty good at drinking and not letting it be known I'm  drunk unless I'm really fucking hammered.  And then I do a webcast from my house, fucking drunk off my ass, and I watch back and go 
[03:00:30]  like, wow, I was fucking drunk.  I was drunk.  But this is a little different.  Yeah, this is, you know, national television.  Nah, just go for it.  It's St. Paddy's Day.  Serious show.  St. Paddy's Day.  But yeah, yeah.  It's expected.  I'm thinking Hannity's probably going to do one of those, like a politician drink at the  Imus thing where he just has the beer and holds it for the photo op and takes a sip  and puts it down because he's got work to do.  Right.  Meanwhile, I'll be on my, like, my eighth beer.  Just chugging. 
[03:01:00]  While he's fucking, I'm just slamming.  Give me another Guinness.  Oh.  Another Guinness, please.  Brewskies.  Hmm.  If anyone, tell me you didn't, you had to say Brewskies once when you were growing up.  Sarcastically.  Oh.  Could I, hey, there's one friend right now.  You got to say it like this, too.  You got to be like, hey, pass me one of them Brewskies.  And then slides across the bar and it just hits your hand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you just grab it.  Hey, Brewskies.  Brewskies.  Michu Kaku on Fox right now.  Well, we used to talk to him.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Brewski.  You want to hear Tiger Woods farting?  You got the video?  Yeah, let's hear that.  Someone is calling me Opie McLovin.  Road Pops.  What about Road Pops?  Road Pop, no.  No?  Road Sodas is funny.  Road Sodas is terrible.  That takes it.  That's terrible.  See, the problem is we weren't trying to be funny.  But you used to drive around and just get shit-faced in a car.  I mean, that's what you did.  Driving, right?  We weren't trying to be funny.  We thought we were being cool by saying Road Sodas.  Oh, believe me.  That's what makes this more disgy.  I didn't think you were ever trying to be funny with that. 
[03:02:00]  Maybe we were as kids, but I'm here to say no, we weren't.  We really thought we were being cool.  Road Sodas.  Oh, that's cool.  That's cool, right?  Why do I admit this shit?  I like it.  Road Sodas.  You going to play it from there or should I play it from here?  We can play it from there.  All right, yeah, here's Tiger Woods farting on the golf course, I think.  Oh, okay.  I thought this was an old one, Danny.  What are you saying?  No, it's new.  It's new, okay.  It's a new fart.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I think this, man, he must eat a lot of fiber because I think this happened already. 
[03:02:30]  This might be the second one.  Unexpected as it is, he actually farted again.  Ooh.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  That's really all there is. 
[03:03:00]  There's not much more after that, but you hear whoever was announcing that goes, uh...  Is that Tiger Woods?  You hear the fart and then the guy goes, spectator noise?  Yeah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Like they won't acknowledge it, but they'll say that there was a spectator noise.  Spectator noise.  And then he goes, is that Tiger Woods?  That's how I'm addressing every Jim Norton fart from now on.  Every time he's farts, I'm just going to go, spectator noise.  Jim Norton.  Fizzies? 
[03:03:30]  Fizzies.  No?  No.  Now, how about a couple of beers?  Hey, yeah, grab some beers for the drive.  Ty in Jersey said Fizzies.  And here, we got confirmation.  He's a faggot.  We got confirmation from Adam in Jersey.  Adam, go ahead.  Yeah, Adam.  Hey, how's it going?  You know, we called, uh, basically anything, any alcohol beverage that you would drive around  drinking, we called road sodas iced tea vodka, uh, sweet tea vodka, anything like that. 
[03:04:00]  Say, road sodas, Ant.  You gotta, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be one step ahead of the law.  Like he's not, what are you drinking tonight, guys?  Ah, just some road sodas, all right?  You're free to go.  That's right.  Never heard that in my life.  Go.  All right.  One step in front of the law.  You were weaving, but I guess it was because of the fizzy, uh, properties of the road soda.  The Fizzies.  Yes, yes.  Oh, we do have some Fizzies in here, sir. 
[03:04:30]  Fizzies.  Let's say hi to Bob in Connecticut, because you brought up slurring words on Hannity, and  he just wants to clarify here for everybody, okay?  Yeah.  All right, because you might be, uh, a little drunk on Hannity tonight.  Okay.  Let's get the word out to Sean.  Bob in Connecticut, go ahead.  Good morning, bo-bo-bo-boys.  Hello.  Yeah, I was wondering if racial slurs count as well, because my bell's gonna be going off like  crazy.  Oh, slurring.  No, I meant slurring my words, like, uh, you know, not being able to speak properly,  not racial slurs, which, uh, come out of my mouth all the time, whether I'm drunk or 
[03:05:00]  not.  It won't be like the compound.  It's tougher to hold them back, though, when you're drunk, so.  You think I might, uh...  This is a good question by this, uh, Bob.  I could filter myself a little.  I don't think I'll be dropping any N-bombs.  Okay.  Uh, no.  How about bevies?  Bevies?  A bevy of bevies would be, uh...  The way it's funny is how he introduces, he's like, how about bevies?  Because he's trying to sell it.  I'm, I'm, I'm good at selling shit.  Road sodas.  Justin Pell from Pittsburgh called him bevies.  Bevies.  Yeah, bevies.  Road sodas. 
[03:05:30]  Oof.  What?  I don't know, it's kind of gay.  It's a little gayness.  Oh, yeah.  Just a tad.  I can't argue that.  It's, it's pretty bad.  Uh, how about, uh, Chris in Los Angeles?  Chris?  Yeah.  Hey there, Chris.  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh, I just want to let you know, we call them, uh, travelers or pre-gamers?  Pre-gamers.  I've heard pre-gamers before.  Pre-gamers.  Travelers.  Never heard of travelers.  I have to have a few pre-gamers.  Never heard of that.  Well, you just say it.  I'm just gonna pre-game.  That's just, you just say you're gonna pre-game.  Yeah, you've heard that one, Dan?  I haven't heard that one. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  You pre-game before you go to the bar.  I don't call pre-gamers.  Oh, no, you save some cash, you drink like four or five beers, then you go to the bar.  Oh, yeah, I've done that.  Yeah, I've spent so much.  Yeah, yeah.  You pre-game.  I've done that.  Okay.  Yeah, I remember those days.  Eight beers.  We would have eight beers each, three of us, and then, uh, that would be a case, obviously,  right?  Uh-huh.  And then go to Huntington.  And then what?  I can't even imagine that.  And then go to the bars and buy overpriced beers.  And then go to the bars and actually drink.  Yeah.  Try to pick up some chicks.  Yeah.  We would grab a case of beer, go to my room when I was in high school, and the 
[03:06:30]  three of us would, yeah, slam a case, eight beers each, and then we would go out.  I can't even imagine that.  The tolerance that I used to have.  Fuck that.  We all used to do it.  Yeah.  Tiger Woods on Jimmy Fallon, everyone.  This is, uh, pretty good.  Tiger Woods, thanks for coming back to our show.  Thanks for having me.  It's been a year and a half since you were on our show.  Yep.  What have you been up to?  Uh, nothing.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Playing bad golf.  Yeah.  Uh, I want to, uh, say thank you for having the courage to come on a late night comedy  program.  I appreciate it.  Honestly, I've got to commend you for that.  Thank you for doing that.  Thank you.  Because, uh, it must have been painful and awful situation, the whole, uh, thing that  you went through.  But from a comedian's standpoint, and my monologue writers, thank you so much.  That was some of the greatest comedy in the game ever.  I mean, you must have heard every golf joke in the history of the, but that is like a magical 
[03:07:30]  thing that happened, your, your awful pain, and we laughed at your pain.  And I mean, just, I mean, not even making jokes, it kind of wrote itself.  The whore jokes.  I mean, balls, uh, shafts, holes, uh, foursomes.  I mean, it really wrecks itself.  I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  Tiger's a bore.  Yeah.  Tiger doesn't say shite.  Nah.  Just sat there.  Good for Jimmy Fallon, though. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  He's trying to clean up, clean up his image, though, after what happened.  I mean, he probably staged that fart, and then he just came, seriously.  Yeah, why?  Would that, would that clean up his image?  Well, seriously, everyone's clapping for him now.  It shows, it shows that he's like human a little now.  For real.  Okay.  I didn't think of it in those terms.  He's just, he's just, he just sucks.  No?  I didn't think of it in those terms, that it would make you a normal, uh, human.  Yeah, he's just fucked in the way.  But he's on TV talking about a fart.  Yeah.  So it's like, yeah.  What about ponies? 
[03:08:30]  Ponies?  Yeah.  Those are the little ones, right?  That's right.  You remember ponies.  Yeah.  Those tiny ones?  Yeah.  You call them ponies.  Yeah, those little mini buds that you'd drink.  Those things were, uh.  Nips.  Nips.  Nips, right?  Oh, please.  Nips.  Weren't they Nips, the half ones?  No time.  No time for that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  There's no time for that kind of language.  Talking about beer here.  What's wrong with you?  This is not the time or place.  That's right.  For that.  The little beers, of course.  I know what he's talking about.  Uh, they, yeah, I love those.  The little, the little buttons. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  They would go down really fast, though.  They would.  I don't know why they were fun to drink.  I wanted more beer.  I guess they stayed colder longer.  Remember the little half cans?  Yeah.  Those little half cans of bud.  I got a, I got a picture for you that would make you laugh.  Hold on.  That's regarding these, these little beers.  I remember the half fucking Budweiser.  You remember the other cans?  Do they sell them anymore?  No.  Uh, you know what?  I see them sometimes.  I haven't seen those in years.  Just in the cans, obviously.  Yeah.  I forgot all about that.  They're like little eight ounce buds. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  Yeah, it's a nice little, uh, mini road soda.  I think those are just marketed towards, like, junior high school kids, so you could say  you drank six beers and you feel cool about it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're probably right.  You drank fucking three and a half beers.  Here's a picture, Anthony.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  It's a midget holding a, a midget holding half a Coke.  Let me see.  A little one.  Show up.  You can pass it.  That's crazy.  That was in, I did a tour in Mexico and there was a midget on my show and he's holding.  That's great.  It's actually, that's a normal size for him.  It's the half one.  It looks fat, though. 
[03:10:00]  That's so weird.  Uh, let me.  It's a fidget.  Let me go with Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, I used to go drinking with an older guy at work and to disguise him.  Weird.  Uncle Paul.  We're going out for choir practice.  Choir practice?  Choir practice.  Yeah.  We're going to go tune up at the bar and enjoy some choir practice.  Did the older guy.  Sounds like a cop lingo.  Did the older guy touch your wiener?  Exactly right.  Yeah, that's.  He was a retired homicide cop.  Yeah, that's what the cops call it.  Choir practice.  Choir practice?  They do?  Yeah.  Well, they used to.  Back in the fucking 70s, I think. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Back when there was this nice, great corruption and fucking you could beat people.  What about this one?  Burger in Houston.  Burger?  Yeah, my dad always referred to his, all alcohol pretty much is spody-oody.  What?  That doesn't even sound.  That doesn't.  Oh, God.  All right.  I have the craziest sensory image for it now.  Whenever I smell it, I always think of him calling it spody-oody.  What's up, Adam and Tyler?  Why are you waving bobo in?  I wasn't.  I swear to God. 
[03:11:00]  I have nothing to do with this.  I waved at.  What are you doing?  I did not wave in.  I happen to be in the-  Get out of the microphone.  What are you doing?  He was in the vicinity.  Why did you come in here?  I have nothing to do with this.  I happen to be around the area for the parade.  Why did you come in here in the studio?  They told me.  I left a message on my face.  I told you to come into this studio right here.  You guys told me to come in here just now when I saw you guys waving.  No, it wasn't waving.  That was a goodbye wave.  I was fucking saying, we need the air conditioning turned on. 
[03:11:30]  So I was waving my arm, like, for air.  You don't just walk into a studio unless somebody out there says, Bobo, you come in.  I misread the waving.  I misread the waving.  Bobo.  All right, you should leave then.  Yeah.  What are you going to-  Are you going to be drinking?  Yeah, I'm going to be drinking tonight.  Great.  That's good.  Well, have fun.  Enjoy yourself.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:12:00]  There he goes.  Bobo.  Bobo.  I totally waved him in.  If you walked around your regular life like you were wasted, why would you then drink?  Yeah.  It probably levels you out.  You would think that would happen, but no.  Not so much with him.  On Saturday night, a lot of us want to get to Bobo State.  Get to Bobo Point.  I used to call it that.  I'd be like, oh, I'm Bobo'd.  I'm Bobo'd.  Yeah.  If you're too many road sodas, I get Bobo'd. 
[03:12:30]  I'm Bobo'd off my ass.  Does he really drink?  Yeah, yeah.  He does?  I've seen him drink.  What's he like when he's drunk?  You can't tell.  He's pretty much like that, retarded, to a point.  This robbery and shootout caught on tape.  These guys never know how to shoot each other.  They're over the couch.  Oh, I think you might have clipped one of them motherfuckers.  Look at them.  They're shooting each other.  I'm watching a convenience store robbery.  They're on each side of the aisle, just shooting over, trying to raise their gun up and shoot 
[03:13:00]  over the top without looking.  I think they just hit a lot of canned products.  Take a shot, motherfucker.  I'm getting word that E-Rock has a message from Imus.  What are you talking about?  I'm sent over a message.  Oh, fuck.  He has some work for you guys to do for the interview.  Oh, does he?  He wants to know what your five favorite songs are and if you can make a list for him.  Five favorite songs?  I'm not going.  Holy shit.  I'm not going.  Why?  Why do we have to know that? 
[03:13:30]  I wrote back why and I haven't heard...  Shut up, Roland.  I haven't heard back yet as to why he wants this.  Five favorite songs?  All right.  Here comes the goof list.  Alice in Chains.  Wood.  I don't really have any music I like.  Sound Garden.  Black Hole Sun.  I like that one.  You like that one?  Yeah.  Something from this century.  You're going to give him a real list?  Yeah, why would you give him a real list? 
[03:14:00]  Because what if it's a situation where me giving him a funny list backfires on me?  What about My Dick's All Shitty?  That's a great song.  That's a song?  My Dick's All Shitty?  You never heard My Dick's All Shitty?  Oh, no.  I thought you were just throwing a line out there.  No.  No.  My Dick's All Shitty.  My Dick's All Shitty.  From your end.  So Dick's All Shitty.  Is that one of you guys?  No.  We wish.  My Dick's All Shitty.  We wish, really.  This is two million bucks.  That is great.  Wow. 
[03:14:30]  Based on a Starship song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just love the passion.  Listen to the passion behind the words.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Say you won't blow me.  I hate it in your face.  Come on.  Say you only take the cock in your dirty face.  Now I'm all filthy. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  There's duty on my dick.  Duty.  It looks just like a black man's face.  So grab your road sodas.  Your coolie needs a diaper.  Oh, coolie.  Because I'm in your cold and blood.  I'm in dirty hand, but am I Dick's All Shitty?  My Dick's All Shitty from your end.  This is a classic. 
[03:15:30]  You're the girl in the back?  Yeah.  The girl?  My Dick's All Shitty from your end.  That's all Dick's All Shitty.  My Dick's All Shitty from your end.  I forgot how much I loved that song.  My Dick's All Shitty from your end.  Who was that?  I don't know.  That's a genius.  Brilliant.  That's certainly a genius.  Brilliant.  We got a cop that wants to talk about road sodas real fast. 
[03:16:00]  George on Long Island.  George.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, George.  Thank you.  NYPD rules.  Absolutely true story.  We had a rookie cop who was working in a command, and the lieutenant found out that he worked in the same area.  So the lieutenant's like, hey, listen, you want to give me a ride home?  And the cop's like, yeah, whatever.  So they go out, and the lieutenant's like, hey, listen, you want to get some road sodas?  So the kid's like, uh, I guess. 
[03:16:30]  So they pull over, and the lieutenant's driving, and he goes, uh, listen, roadies.  The kid looks at him and goes, all right, and he's about to blow him.  And the lieutenant's like, whoa, what are you doing?  Road sodas.  Beers.  All right.  I'm gone.  Colin, it's been great. 
[03:17:00]  I want you to plug your Twitter and get the fuck out of here.  Everyone have a good, uh, good St. Paddy's Day.  I think that pretty much wrapped that up.  That was a great story, by the way.  Holy shit.  What was that?  It's a blow job.  And, like, I don't even know what happened in that car. 
[03:17:30]  He's asking for roadies, and roadies means...  So the guy was going to blow him?  I don't know.  I guess.  I don't know what happened there.  I don't know what happened there.  Apple's up 720.  Nice.  Yeah.  Good.  Thank God.  Colin, you promoting anything, sir?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to be at, uh, Gotham Comedy Club this Saturday.  Uh, you can check out Gotham, uh, Comedy Club dot com.  Uh, I'm also, website, ColinCain.com, and I'm on Twitter, uh, which is at Colin Cain. 
[03:18:00]  And I gotta say, out of all the shows that I do, easily the most loyal followers, ONA,  without a fucking doubt.  Oh, they'll turn on you.  No, man.  It's all right.  Well, yeah, but, honestly, I gotta say that all the people, the stuff that they credit,  you guys, I'm not just saying this because you're fucking in front of me.  Yeah, well.  It's, it's, it's representation, you guys.  It's pretty fucking badass.  That is.  It is.  They're not bad.  They're not a bad sort.  Oh, they're all keepers.  For the most part.  I'd have a few road sodas with him. 
[03:18:30]  And we're not talking about head.  No, no head.  I don't know how that happened.  How does fucking roadies turn?  What the fuck just happened there?  And he said roadies.  Roadies.  So what?  I was going to blow him a few times.  I thought it was road head?  Like, why would you blow him and not say, dude, why are you asking me to blow you?  Right.  Like, nothing made sense there in his story.  And he said true story, which should have been our first.  Right.  Just the, just the, the seven seconds of silence after he's like, all right, goodbye.  All right.  I'm, uh, that right there was just, yeah.  Well, oh, well, so much for ending on a high note today, huh? 
[03:19:00]  Uh, you know what?  It just makes the beginning of tomorrow's show look that much better.  Ah, good point.  That's what I look at.  Sam, what do we got for the 10 o'clock hour?  Why the fuck is Bobo here?  Is he here for your, uh, portion of the program?  Yeah.  Are you going to destroy the 10 to 11 hour with the likes of Bobo?  Well, Bobo, uh, emailed Travis at one o'clock in the morning and said, I'll be going to  the St. Patrick's Day Parade.  So obviously I should stop by. 
[03:19:30]  And so we said, obviously you should.  And that was about all the thought that went into it.  Why?  Are you repeating that cop story?  Did you just call?  Yeah.  Did you just call from the other room?  Did you just call?  Did you guys not want Bobo today?  Oh, well.  I'm glad he's not on our portion of the program.  Well, we're not going to have a lot of Bobo.  Oh, no.  The Sam Roberts show can do whatever it wants.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I don't care.  Okay.  It's not like I listen.  No, we'll be, uh, celebrating St. Patrick's Day by reliving some St. Patrick's Day moments. 
[03:20:00]  Uh, we got some Elvis dice that we're going to play.  You know what's great about your portion of the show?  I thought you were going to say shit for a second.  Well, shit.  Uh, like, the, the, the time that you're on, instead of it going right from our show to  Ron and Fez when I jump into the truck to go home, it gives me a buffer for when I'm  stuck in the tunnel and the signal craps out.  Okay.  So then it's just, like, silence.  And then when I pop out the other end after the traffic, I could put Ron and Fez on, and 
[03:20:30]  I didn't lose them in the tunnel.  Oh.  So I get to listen to, you know, good radio.  So it's like something, it's something good that you don't mind missing.  Or just a buffer between this program and the one I want to listen to.  It's like, oh, thank God, there's something.  That I'm not like, fuck, I'm in the tunnel and can't hear.  Because you might have missed something otherwise.  Right, it doesn't upset me when the signal cuts out in the tunnel.  Well, one of my jobs as a producer is to make your life less stressful.  And that's what it does, because I'm like, I'm like, I don't care. 
[03:21:00]  Right, I don't give a shit.  The signal's gone, I'm not like, fuck, ah, God, quick, get out the other end.  Like, I wonder what he's saying right now.  You wouldn't think that.  But not a care in the world.  Wow.  Okay.  So thank you for that.  I mean, in that respect, you're welcome.  I want to, I tell you, I appreciate it.  Are we doing this Kiss Me on Mimus and we need five songs, huh?  What does that mean?  Give me five songs with the word ho in it for my appearance on Mimus's.  Money Cash Hoes.  Yeah, that's the one.  That's the one.  I want all my songs to have ho in the title.  Oh, shit. 
[03:21:30]  Something with nappy, something with headed, and something with ho.  Yeah.  Something with nappy roots.  He don't want to hear that.  I'll tell him I like the nappy roots.  What songs are they like?  What songs are they like?  I'd be like, I don't know.  The house next door to me was sold to, no, no, not that one.  Michael's in trouble.  I'm not a couple of Johnny Rebels.  No, no, not Johnny Rebels.  Nope.  I'm sure he has the whole collection.  I'm sure. 
[03:22:00]  I'm sure.  Let's go.  Thank you, Colin King.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Thank you.  See you soon, Sam.  No problemo.  Enjoy the 10 o'clock hour, and you out there, enjoy your St. Paddy's Day, I guess.  Happy St. Paddy's Day.  Yay.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM, the virus. </pre>
