<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-course.  The show began with a discussion of the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370,  ridiculing the media’s "zombie plane" moniker and speculation ranging from mechanical failure to outlandish conspiracy theories.  This was interspersed with the hosts' typical self-deprecating humor aimed at each other and the show's producers.  A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the impending departure of Lady Di, a female intern, with much discussion about her often-questionable behavior, spending habits, and the hosts' efforts to collect money for her.  The hosts also teased upcoming segments featuring Lady Di, including a potential show with Marion.

Listener calls punctuated the broadcast, addressing various news items, including a lesbian teacher scandal (with graphic speculation about their activities), a viral video gone wrong, and a discussion of the unlikely scenario of male teachers facing similar leniency.  The hosts engaged in extensive, often morbidly fascinated discussion about cannibalism as a means of survival at sea.  The show included a conversation about a new Boston album and a Billy Joel performance.

The segment featuring in-studio guests Brian and Josh began with a caller's incorrect assertion about a Nirvana song.  The discussion then devolved into graphic sexual humor regarding the fired female teachers. The focus shifted back to Lady Di's departure, with anecdotes about her saw-themed makeup, a confrontation with Bill about a TGIF visit, and her significant beer consumption.  Lady Di contributed her own ideas for future segments, including a conga line and celebrity guests. Heather B, a guest from a neighboring SiriusXM studio, joined the broadcast, sharing her experiences on "The Real World."  Lady Di's vomiting incident in the studio bathroom was also recounted.

Comedian Dan Soder joined the show, discussing his stand-up experiences, particularly dealing with intoxicated family members at his performances.  His upcoming San Francisco shows were also promoted.  A “Bobo” bit, filled with juvenile and sexually suggestive humor, was included. The hosts discussed an upcoming live podcast recording in Jersey City, and the conversation returned to Dan Soder's experiences with legalized marijuana in Colorado, including graphic details about his dispensary visits.  A listener call further detailed their own Colorado dispensary experience, followed by the hosts' reaction to another listener’s lewd comment about Lady Di.

A subsequent segment featured a recurring interview with Lady Di, who sported a “wacky fucking clown wig.” An attempt to interview an aviation expert, Dan, about the missing Malaysian airplane failed spectacularly, giving way to sexually charged conversations and tangents.  A caller, Cedric, discussed marijuana legalization in predominantly Black cities.  Another caller, Eric, and his brother proposed a “sympathy fuck” to Lady Di, leading to extensive and explicit discussions about threesomes, sibling dynamics, and sexual preferences. Lady Di's sexual history, including graphic details about anal sex and her lost virginity, was recounted. The attempted interview with the aviation expert was further interrupted by discussions of Heather O’Rourke and Bill, a roommate allegedly involved with Lady Di. Greg Gutfeld, author of *Not Cool*, joined the show and engaged in a discussion of hipster culture, the misuse of certain terms, and the absurdity of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 news coverage.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Lady Di's sexual experiences.

Another segment opened with a discussion of a botched makeover.  The conversation then moved to a previous show featuring Breitbart and Private Kyle, where a photo of Anthony Weiner's crotch was revealed, and the hosts discussed the strategy behind its release and Barbara Walters' reaction.  This transitioned to an interview with a porn star using pornography to pay for her tuition, prompting a debate on the ethics of her situation.  A large man walking by briefly interrupted the discussion. The show then touched on e-cigarettes and their media portrayal, with a listener from Wisconsin highlighting their positive impact. Greg Gutfeld and Dan Soder, both in studio, participated in this discussion, along with discussions of hipster culture, manufacturing job losses, and the romanticization of evil in media.  A significant portion dealt with bullying, with the hosts reflecting on their own experiences and Greg Gutfeld discussing the romanticization of rebellion and lack of bully accountability.  Listener calls included one from someone claiming to be Lady Di's best friend.  The show featured discussions of WWE wrestling and pop culture references, concluding with banter with Gutfeld and Soder, a send-off for Lady Di, and a final song lyric.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You know he's buying what she's selling.  Good morning, everyone.  It's Friday.  Oh, it's Saturday.  Where's our Friday guy?  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  Friday.  Wow.  That was old school.  Yeah.  A lot of people happy that it's Friday, not just because, you know, the weekend gets kicked  off, but because someone else gets kicked off this program.  Oh, the Lady Di thing ends today. 
[00:00:30]  I got a fat wallet today.  What a bittersweet.  Did you bring some money in today?  It's not just for me.  I brought a couple of Benjis.  I think we owe her at least $250 for the week.  Wasn't it like $50 a day?  Something like that.  I haven't given her money every day.  I tossed over money at the beginning of the week.  You're in for a Hyundai?  Yeah.  I'm close to that, I think.  I'm not up to a Hyundai yet, but...  Man, she's been doing fine here. 
[00:01:00]  If she didn't blow over $140 on beer, she'd be in a lot better shape.  I swear to you, I was thinking of really taking care of her today.  Yeah.  But then I'm thinking...  Yeah, you're just contributing.  Then I'm thinking she's just going to go through it immediately.  Immediately.  Maybe there's a way I could just maybe send her another envelope in a week or two.  Spread it out a little bit.  Right?  She can't control money.  No, she's...  Sam, we're passing the hat around today, too.  Oh, boy. 
[00:01:30]  What do you mean?  For Lady Di.  Me and Ann are taking the brunt of it, but you better squeeze a couple bucks out of that wall.  I should be getting money from her for watching her.  You better squeeze a little bit and make sure Dennis Falcone squeezes a little bit.  Oh, he'll be paying.  And make sure if Tim Sabian is here, make sure he squeezes.  You think Sam Roberts wants to cough over money to the fucking Lady Di?  No, he doesn't like...  He's broke.  He's destitute.  He's a bum.  He's not broke anymore.  I'm a bum.  Should he be doing better? 
[00:02:00]  Yes, but this kid's not broke anymore.  Oh, man.  The wife makes some cash?  She's doing all right.  They're doing okay.  How much do you get paid?  Can we put together some highlights?  Oh, we're already working on something.  Nice.  But just, no, not one big solid I'll remember you piece.  I want highlights.  It's coming, huh?  He's like, oh, back to the drawing board.  I want highlights so we can just sit back and go, remember when this happened?  Oh, and then this happened.  Here's a moment.  Here's another moment. 
[00:02:30]  What's wrong with you?  We don't want to work.  We could do that.  We've got to get older producers.  Yeah, that understand.  That understand how this works.  What it's like to just be beaten down and done.  Where it's like, oh, I get your mindset, guys.  Here's 20 highlight clips for today.  And then I go, thank you, older producer.  So you don't want, like, a producer.  Who's been in the business a long time and been beaten to death.  Yeah, you're with your ambition.  You don't want somebody who's coming in and be like, yeah, we had a full week.  Let's do a Friday show where we make new highlights.  Oh, God, no. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  So we're passing the hat around.  I don't want anyone hiding.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock.  What about E-Rock?  He's got some cash.  E-Rock's from a rich family.  E-Rock's got the cash.  You know he had a boat in high school?  Oh, he drove it there.  Yes, he did.  Pretty cool, huh?  Pretty cool, huh?  He drove to high school.  That's pretty cool, I think.  Pretty cool, huh?  You know, I think I'm tapping out with this plane thing.  Yeah, huh?  Good luck to those people.  Godspeed.  I mean, good luck to the people on the news.  Now they're calling it a zombie plane. 
[00:03:30]  They actually had a graphic that said zombie plane, question mark.  I always laugh because over the years we've been looked at as scumbags, basically.  Well, of course.  Shock jock scumbags.  Sure, sure.  You know, every other fucking adjective you could think of.  Uh-huh.  Horrific adjective.  You could add a few of those to the Twitter today if you want.  Sure.  And then you watch the news, and they're just way worse than we ever were.  Who greenlighted?  I swear to you.  Zombie plane.  They had a graphic.  Zombie plane.  And one, they went with some old school World War II guy that knows everything about flying. 
[00:04:00]  He goes, I prefer not to use the term zombie plane.  Oh, really?  And then the anchor is all like, how dare you?  We're going with zombie plane.  Why would you go with zombie plane, by the way?  And then the guy goes, I'll accept ghost plane, but not zombie plane.  Very good for him.  Right.  Because you could say ghost plane.  They're all dead, and the fucking thing's just going.  I thought when I went to bed and woke up this morning that they would have had confirmation that that debris was from the crash. 
[00:04:30]  No.  No, I would have thought so, too.  But it started, that whole satellite photo of the debris, that whole story started falling apart yesterday.  Right.  They started looking at it and going, it might be a shipping container.  Right.  And who knew that those giant containers are just falling off ships all the time.  Right.  That'd be pretty cool.  Yeah, you just go around picking those things up.  Imagine you're stranded at sea, and all of a sudden the currents push you toward a nice big container that has some good stuff on it. 
[00:05:00]  That'd be a cool way to live for a while.  But then you open it up and find out it's just rubber dog shit from Korea.  Right.  You got fucking a whole container of that fake vomit and rubber dog shit.  How would you even open up one of those things?  I don't know.  On the ocean.  Right.  It would sink.  You'd have to cut into the top somehow.  I don't know.  That stupid movie with the sailboat and Robert Redford.  Oh, right. 
[00:05:30]  Where he's stuck.  He hits one of those.  Really?  He's just at sea in his sailboat.  Right.  And out of nowhere, he wakes up.  You have to, bam, bam, a water sluts coming in.  And it was a shipping container that he just ran into.  They spotted the missing plane.  They didn't spot the missing plane officially.  What are you, out of your mind?  We got every news channel on.  So if it happens during our show, we'll let you know.  They think they have debris that might be the missing plane.  Might be.  But so far, they can't find that actual debris.  No.  Because that's about five days ago that image was taken. 
[00:06:00]  And what's strange is that it's 1,500 miles off Perth.  Uh-huh.  Southwest, right?  And we're just talking about this.  It takes four hours to fly there.  Four hours to fly back, obviously.  So that's eight hours of your day.  They say they can only search for maybe two hours.  A couple hours.  On site.  And then they've got to go back.  Yeah.  It's so remote out there.  It's, if this pilot did decide to kill himself and didn't want any details as to how it was  done, who did it, things like that.  Yeah.  He picked the perfect spot. 
[00:06:30]  Because it's so hard to even get to this area.  Right.  The weather sucks, apparently.  Right.  It's between Australia and Antarctica, in the middle of nowhere, in very deep water.  Right.  They can't even, like you said, they can't even get to it quick enough to be able to search  for any period of time.  And then the news is like, you know, these planes could, you know, refuel in the air.  Why aren't they doing this?  Because that costs a shitload of money.  That's a lot of fucking money.  I'm not really sure how much resources a lot of these countries want to put into this search. 
[00:07:00]  And then you need a fuel, a fueling plane.  Yeah.  And he's got to fly away the fuck out there, too.  Right.  So, you know.  Yeah.  You're just using so much fuel on this thing.  I don't know.  Well, and I think that the mystery as to what happened to this plane is more important to  the people that are giving resources than the people.  Right.  I don't think the United States government and all these other governments that are giving  machinery and fuel and man hours and everything are doing it so the families can feel better. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  They want to know what the fuck happened to this plane.  They want to make sure it's in the ocean.  Right.  And that it's not being used for some EVL.  EVL.  They want to make sure.  Right.  They want to know how this could happen so they can maybe prevent it from happening again.  But the families, they're just like, ah, whatever.  But the news, they said yesterday, this is the best news yet when they show the images  of the debris.  And I'm like, that's not the best news.  That's horrible news for the families. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  For the families, they don't want to think that that could be the plane.  The best news is them getting off another plane, waving to their families if they were  found.  But the news, they're just so self-absorbed.  The best news yet, no.  No.  Families don't want to hear that it might be the debris.  Right.  The best news for the family is that, no, that wasn't the debris.  Yeah, that wasn't it.  So then they could hold out hope that, what, they're living somewhere.  Somewhere.  Still a shot.  Where would they be living?  Australia.  They're in the epic. 
[00:08:30]  In the epic.  Look at.  Having some blooming onions and steaks at the epic.  One woman.  I think she's the American, the wife of the Americans.  She's like, I believe in my heart that my husband's still alive.  Yeah, she's a little biased, I think, right?  You think?  Maybe a little.  Well, that's not a viral video, MSNBC.  The kid with the...  But now, so now we won't have Steve Smith.  We can't cheer for Steve Smith anymore on the team.  Why are they playing this again?  This is three days old. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Nice airwit.  And no one's even sending it around.  No.  Believe me, when a video goes viral, we know it because we get it a thousand fucking times.  Yeah, I didn't get this one once.  What?  Oh, gosh.  I don't think it's a good sports education there.  But it all worked out for the little guy.  Yeah, it worked out for the little guy.  Yeah.  When Gavin met with his CEO in Times Square after Smith tracked him down.  Oh, that's why.  Steve Smith connects with the crying Gavin.  Hey, what a guy.  Well, that parent is a dirtbag. 
[00:09:30]  He is.  To make your kid cry on purpose to try to get a viral video, that's nuts.  Trying for that big moment.  Oh, and boy, do I want a viral video, but I wouldn't go down that road.  You could always sell your soul to the devil.  I'm not going down that road.  And do that.  Anyway, so.  Mm-hmm.  So the plane thing.  Yeah, yeah.  They can't find that debris they saw in the satellite images so far.  Nope.  Hmm.  So they'll continue searching.  But yeah, I'm kind of...  That dweeb in the freaking flight simulator is driving me insane. 
[00:10:00]  You know, if they would have hopped on a real plane and fucking looked for the plane, maybe.  Right, right.  They've sat in that simulator for days.  And he's like, you know, this experience feels so real.  You find yourself actually looking out the window trying to look for the debris.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  How about you help out?  No one cares about him and his flight simulator reports anymore.  Oh, that's the angle CNN is using.  Let's go back to the flight simulator god.  They love it.  They love the floor with the fucking map on it so they can walk around and place red dots where things happened. 
[00:10:30]  And they're just trying to milk this for all it's worth.  Yeah.  It's funny.  And then they go with the outrageous crap.  I think they mentioned black holes last night.  Yeah, yeah.  Black holes were mentioned.  If you can find that clip.  But now they're thinking, hey, I don't know.  It's a possibility the plane's in some black hole somewhere.  You know, nothing's off the table yet.  Black holes, meteors.  Aliens.  Aliens.  I would like to think aliens. 
[00:11:00]  We went with aliens very early on.  We did.  We did.  Yeah.  As a joke.  But they're actually not saying it as a joke.  No.  Everything's out in the open.  Is this a good clip, the black hole clip?  Oh, good.  Oh, here we go.  It was hijacking or terrorism or mechanical failure or pilot error.  But what if it was something fully that we don't really understand?  A lot of people have been asking about that, about black holes and on and on and on and  all of these conspiracy theories.  Let's look at this.  Noah says, what else can you think about black hole, Bermuda Triangle?  And then Deji says, just like the movie Lost. 
[00:11:30]  And, of course, they're also referencing the Twilight Zone, which is a very similar plot.  That's what people are saying.  I know it's preposterous, but is it preposterous?  There's a man on the wing.  Well, it is.  Black hole is about, you know, a small black hole would suck in our entire universe.  So we know it's not that, Bermuda Triangle is often weather.  And Lost is a TV show.  Thank you.  It's a TV show.  I always like things for which there's data, history, crunch the numbers.  So for me, those aren't there. 
[00:12:00]  But I think it's wonderful that the whole world is trying to help with their theories.  And I absolutely love the theories.  They're not helping.  They're not helping.  The whole world isn't helping.  It's a fucking water cooler conversation.  Right.  Two hundred and fucking, what, thirty some odd lives?  Yeah.  And it all amounts to a drama.  It's a TV drama.  Mm-hmm.  No one really cares.  You just watch because, you know, you want to be the guy that has the next thing to say  to your friends.  Hey, did you hear?  Mm-hmm.  No one cares.  Race to find the flight recorders. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, boy.  And they talk about only days left off the signal that comes off of the flight recorder.  Right.  Although it's a race.  But they should put better transmitters in those things, huh?  Or, why not, well, I'm, oh, boy, I just almost went with that.  Oh, you did.  You know where I was going, right?  You went with that joke.  No, no, I wasn't.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no, I wasn't.  Guess the joke, people.  Oh, yeah.  I know that joke. 
[00:13:00]  Why don't you make the whole plane out of the black box material?  Right.  The black box always survives.  Oh, I don't think.  They got some cool equipment, though.  Yeah, yeah.  They're showing planes and ships.  It's not even like a, it's a submersible.  Oh.  But it's not a submarine.  Oh.  That kind of just maps the whole ocean floor and goes up and down over the mountains underwater 
[00:13:30]  and all that shit.  And that's how they found the other black box.  Sonar.  It's crazy stuff.  Sonar.  Radar.  Yeah, but they just throw it in.  It's on its own.  Electric toothbrushes.  Yeah.  It's pretty much an underwater drone.  Yeah, yeah.  Just flies around and maps the bottom.  Finds some kind of anomaly and goes, oh, there it is.  Right.  Amazing stuff we got.  Good luck to you.  That's the other funny thing.  No one wants to offer their radar shit because it's all top secret stuff.  And their satellite pictures are all grainy. 
[00:14:00]  Meanwhile, we have great satellites that take pristine, crystal clear pictures.  But you don't want everyone to know how good our shit is or their shit is.  Like the Chinese when they released those images about a week ago now.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was the worst.  It was like three.  It was in 360 or something.  It's terrible.  Just terrible.  Like, oh, no, this is our satellite.  That's all we got.  That's all we got.  We're working on it.  But you know this shit is really good.  You have so many countries working, trying to work together on this that no one shares 
[00:14:30]  the information.  Because of that, you don't want people to know what kind of equipment you have because  obviously it's used militarily too.  And, yeah, no, we can't see all that good from 15,000 miles in space.  I swear we can't.  Right.  It's all grainy.  Bill and Georgia, I can tell you that's definitely not a shipping container.  Yeah, all right.  It's looking like it's the plane, but they can't find those pieces right now.  Someone was speculating, an expert or what have you, that it might be a shipping container. 
[00:15:00]  It might be the plane.  Right.  It might not be.  It might be something else.  Let's go to Josh in Boston.  Josh.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  I thought, well, first thing, how long before we have a countdown clock of when the battery  runs out?  Oh, they're already on it.  Yeah.  I think.  I've been just listening to coverage on my XM.  I think they said 17 days, so maybe 16 days we're down to.  They'll put it on the side of the screen.  Yeah.  Countdown to no ping.  Oh, I'm sure.  But then yesterday, I was listening to CNN on the XM radio, so I didn't see this, but 
[00:15:30]  they were talking about the possible ways to ditch a plane in the water.  So they got about, I don't know, maybe 1,300 feet off the water.  And he goes, all right, so we're not going to ditch it in the water out of respect for  the family.  And even if we did, it would freeze up the whole system.  You know damn well they can put that thing in the water, and it would be great TV, but  for some reason, they don't want to.  Ah, they're full of shit, though.  You're talking about the simulator again, because the same people that said that had 
[00:16:00]  no problem showing that mom screaming and bloody murder over the loss of her son.  And holding the cameras up way higher to get the best.  Oh my God, that was horrific.  There were so many flashes going on, I could not believe that they were just shooting or  something like that.  So out of respect for the families, they probably should have said, you know, somebody lost their  shit today, but we'll let the rest of the scumbags play it, but we're not going to  play it here.  So they're full of crap, man.  It's just ridiculous. 
[00:16:30]  But if you remember the Boston Marathon bombing, the coverage on that was crazy, too.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it's a cup of the soup of the day.  Well, the news loves this.  I mean, we get one or two of these a year.  By the way, Boston Marathon coming up soon for you guys.  Oh, yeah.  In one year, huh?  It's going to be a great, I think it's going to be great this year.  I don't know.  I think it's going to be really tough to, you know.  High security, even though the odds of anything happening is so slim.  But they have to make sure it's tight.  If something did happen, oh, boy. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I think it's going to be a great day for the city.  Is it going to be somber?  I hope not.  Somber.  I plan to bang it in the work.  It's not going to be somber, because everyone goes to all those bars and just gets hammered.  It's a little plastic.  God, I miss Boston at times.  Marathon day used to be great.  All right, you clock sucker.  All right, brother.  See you later.  I don't think they'd have been able to land that plane, by the way, in that water.  It's very rough all the time, they said.  That ocean down there is wavy.  It's no Hudson River with Sully fucking landing on what amounted to glass on that day. 
[00:17:30]  Absolutely.  You get some waves when you're coming in at 100 and some odd miles an hour with that much airplane.  It's coming apart.  Right.  Yeah.  No matter what, right?  Yeah.  I watched Air Disasters last night.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I'm fascinated with the mechanics of the whole thing, because they show the accident.  They recreate it.  They have recreation actors, you know, and nice sets of flight decks and whatnot. 
[00:18:00]  And then they have amazing computer graphics, CGI, that looks like the plane flying, and  it shows everything that happens.  And then they go through the investigation and what happened, and they piece it all together,  and it's amazing how many times some one little fucking thing that someone didn't do months  or years ago caused the accident.  And this was the one in Sioux City, Iowa, where the third engine on a DC-10 over the tail came apart. 
[00:18:30]  The rotor fan, one of the fan blades, sliced through one spot on the plane where all three  hydraulic systems lines merged, like, together and just cut all three of them, and they lost  all hydraulics.  So now they can't control the plane at all.  They have no controls.  So they use the engines, one on each wing, to try to, you know, they boost the engine on  one side to try to turn one way, boost it on the other to try to turn it the other way. 
[00:19:00]  And now they're going to try to land.  They needed a guy that was a DC-10 instructor, was one of the passengers.  He comes up into the cockpit and goes, can I help?  They're like, yeah, you run the engines.  Wow.  So the pilots are trying to, like, muscle the plane, and he's working the engine.  And, of course, it cartwheeled in a cornfield.  They lost 100 people.  I think over 100.  I think 130 lived.  Right.  They lost just about half, I think. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, just about half.  And all the flight crew, the pilots and the guy in there and the navigator, whatever they  called it back then, they all lived, too.  So they were interviewing them about what happened and some of the passengers that survived.  It was really amazing.  Well, those guys are walking around knowing that they survived a plane cartwheeling.  Yeah, yeah.  Man.  It was really, it's an amazing story, but I'm fascinated with all those fucking things.  I stopped watching them, though, like a month before we were going to fly somewhere. 
[00:20:00]  Like when I hear them, like, I'm not watching that shit.  Flying is supposed to be safe.  It's safer than walking, they say, but I don't know if that means, do more people get killed  walking per year?  I would gather.  But injured, you know, that's another thing.  Right.  I don't know.  It just seems like if something does happen on a plane, you're more apt to get killed.  Right.  Than you are if something happens to you walking.  Right.  You'll probably get injured. 
[00:20:30]  I don't know what the stat is.  Might take out a leg or something while you're walking.  Right, right.  But, you know, you're not 35,000 feet in the air.  We're off to a good start, and of course this comes in now.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, Marion.  How you doing?  I hope you're here.  It's Marion.  How are you guys?  Oh, look at that sexy morning voice.  Hi, Marion.  What's going on?  Oh, it's very Demi Moore.  Can you imagine rolling over and seeing this?  It would be quite an experience.  Are you laying there in a little negligee? 
[00:21:00]  No.  Morning breath.  Yeah.  That hair is probably all askew.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Hey, Diane.  I just want to give this message to Diane.  Oh, thank you.  Diane, whatever you do today, whatever you get today, don't spend it all in one place.  Okay.  No, I won't.  I won't.  I just want to make sure she hears that.  No.  All right.  I just want to say thank you, and hey, have her back next week.  We're not having her back next week.  Have her back next week.  Do you know how many people just screamed no in their cars? 
[00:21:30]  The feedback on this week has been overwhelmingly positive.  Of course, you're going to get the people that are going to hate everything.  But in general, I mean, you do the percentages yourself, and it's been overwhelmingly positive.  Yeah, yeah.  But I guarantee...  I guarantee...  If we did another week, we would lose everybody.  Everyone.  We have to tap...  No, you wouldn't.  We have to tap out after today. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  She's done after today.  We have to.  You got to have her back maybe in a couple weeks.  No.  No.  I don't think so.  We'll have her back for something else.  Maybe the Lady Di and Marion show.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's the next one on the docket.  Yeah.  Sam, put that on the docket.  Okay.  We're going to give you guys...  Oh, boy.  Hey, I love you guys.  I'll bust and chop.  No, you're not.  I'll bust and chop.  We're going to give you guys one hour on this channel. 
[00:22:30]  Mm-hmm.  With no direction, by the way.  Yeah.  You got to let us know when.  You tell us when you can do it.  We got to rest this a little bit.  Yeah.  We'll get back to you.  Don't go.  Talk to my people.  We got to rest the monsters for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't do this.  I just want to say thank you to both of you.  I love you guys.  Oh, of course.  Well, it's been a...  It's been a strange week, is what I wanted to say. 
[00:23:00]  Yes.  You guys loved it.  Come on.  No, because we went...  I hope you guys didn't love it.  We went into this as just a complete and utter goof.  And I think now all of us, including Anthony,  feel some weird, like, responsibility now.  Not to the point where we would actually do anything of significance.  No.  Anything to inconvenience me is out of the question.  I hate when you realize in your own head that the person is actually a human being.  I've always hated that over the years. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Because we're just trying to entertain the people,  so we find these strange people.  And then something happens, and you're like...  Strange could be fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I got to go, guys.  Bye.  Oh, that's too bad.  I was hoping that you were just drone on for another five minutes.  Bye.  Bye, Marion.  There goes Marion.  And then, like, something happens, and you realize these people are human.  What the fuck?  Well...  What the fuck's that about?  Sort of.  Sort of human, right.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Human-ish.  Right.  Did this broads I need attention alarm go off or something?  Yeah.  That's fucking...  Her I need attention alarm?  Snowy.  Snowy.  Yeah.  I've seen that you've been calling all week, so...  Great.  Sorry, man.  I'm a truck driver.  I get bored.  No, that's a great line.  I should have had you say it.  I heard her.  I said, it's very awful.  Fuck, did her attention alarm go off?  Hit the fucking stills button, you dumb.  She, uh... 
[00:24:30]  God.  She really does need attention.  That one.  Oh, it's bad enough to get put up with one of them.  But now, Jesus.  Every fucking day?  Everybody, every 20 minutes?  God almighty.  Well, uh, be, uh...  You'll be happy to know this is the final day...  Yes.  ...of the Lady Di intern experience, so...  Uh, Mariam won't be calling.  No.  Lady Di won't be running in.  No.  Interrupting everything.  Isn't it, guys?  What?  Kind of like Christmas Eve, isn't it?  I mean, one day...  One more day and no more of those two. 
[00:25:00]  At least for a while.  Yeah, you're looking forward to it like a kid on Christmas Eve.  And I, I think this also takes care of the whole super show concept for a little while, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, we did five super shows this week.  Yeah, so...  Uh-huh.  So we don't have to worry about doing a super show.  Not super show.  Stupid show.  Well, that could be...  That's a good name for it, too, sir.  All right, Snowy.  Love the show, man.  I know you're out there.  I know you're a regular.  Thanks, brother.  Snowy in Michigan.  Yes.  I mean, you know, you recognize the name Snowy.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  It's not that hard.  Yeah.  You're pretty good with the names and cities of people.  And remembering if they call and what they've contributed.  I'm just like, I don't know.  He's new to me.  I don't know.  Every ding-dong day, they're new to me.  Flights return from search area.  Breaking news.  Flights return from search...  That's...  That's not breaking news.  Breaking news.  They don't have anything.  You know, Fox does those Fox News alerts now.  Yeah.  The top of the hour.  Every hour.  So, regardless if they even have an alert, which they don't. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  They do it.  They go, and a Fox News alert.  And then they just mention, like, whatever, I guess, their top story is.  It's their top of the hour thing.  It kind of takes away from the urgency of that alert.  I get tricked, too.  Yeah.  I still get tricked.  You're like, huh?  What?  Oh.  And then you go, oh, that's right.  Like, they do this all the time now.  Using it.  During the Gulf War, I think they started doing that.  And it was, you know, oh, a scut attack. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Like, holy shit, this is an alert.  Oh, yeah, it was.  And now it's, you know, oh, boy.  Planes report no...  Kim Kardashian.  There's your breaking news.  Planes report no debris found.  Wow.  Oh, man.  This continues.  It's coming back.  And these are the Poseidon planes that the U.S. is sending over there.  And they scan with all kinds of equipment.  So if something is down there in their area, they'll see it.  Apparently nothing's down there.  Man. 
[00:27:00]  Amazing.  I'm following one of the news guys that are on one of those planes.  Are you?  Yeah, he's on Twitter.  And he's kind of reporting what it's like and what they're seeing and stuff.  And that they're not finding anything.  It's got to be creepy to be a plane all the way out there.  Just all the way out there.  In the middle of nowhere.  And they're flying fucking low.  Like 300 feet, 200 feet over the water.  And you see that just whizzing by.  Right.  Knowing if anything happens.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  We're out here for a little while. 
[00:27:30]  Imagine you survived the plane crash, but you're in that part of the world.  Just being tossed around.  Oh, man.  I'm starving.  I hope someone shows up soon.  These peanuts are running out.  Peanuts.  Plain peanuts.  What would you eat on your body first?  You've got to go with your pinky.  Just so you can get acclimated to eating yourself.  Really?  And it's not that big a deal.  You can still use your hand.  Yeah, you've got to save your thumb.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  How would you get your pinky off with no tools?  Would you just gnaw through it?  I think you'd just eat it on the bone.  Oh, my God.  Like a little corn on the cob.  You'd just eat it like that.  I think I would eat my athlete's foot first.  Because that would come off nice.  Yeah.  Nice and easy.  Yeah.  Start with that.  Start with that.  You could go with a meaty part of your arm, maybe.  Like your bicep.  No, you need your bicep.  But how much do you have to eat to survive like an extra day? 
[00:28:30]  Let's say you're going to die of starvation.  How much of your body do you have to eat to survive another day?  I think you could prolong your life for a good clip if you just do like one little mouthful of meat off of yourself a day.  Really?  One good big bite of protein in you, I think, would help you out.  So, you know, how about that meaty part when you make a fist and bang your fist on the table?  Right there?  Like that little meaty part under there.  But that's tough to get through with your teeth. 
[00:29:00]  It is.  You're going to have to work at it.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Gnawing on it.  Can you pull your ear off your body?  I think you could.  An ear doesn't have much.  Yeah, but I think if you really.  Not much protein.  If you really.  Just grab it hard.  And rip your.  So you're saying you could rip your ear off your head.  Yes.  And nibble on that for a while.  Yes.  You might get something out of the lobes, but the top isn't really much.  You know, but it's like eating.  It's like one of those bad wings.  Eating a rib or, yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, like a chicken wing.  A sad chicken wing.  That doesn't have much meat on it.  I think I might try to rip an ear off.  Oh, thank God.  I'm trying to think what else.  You can get off your body easily.  Maybe the back of your calf, but you can't get that up to your mouth unless it's really.  We've got to do some stretching first.  Skin tags.  Those are snacks.  Eating like popcorn chicken.  That's an in-between meal snack.  Would you get protein from your own nails?  Nah, they're just dead skin.  That's too bad. 
[00:30:00]  Like the same thing hair is made of.  I'm looking at my body.  I'm trying to figure out.  I'm trying to think.  I think I would have to rip my ear off.  Can you pull some of your pectoral and nibble at that?  Like bite out of your pecs?  I used to bite between my bicep and my shoulder when I was like frustrated.  Yeah.  So I think I could easily get a good bite in there.  You could probably, like your ear, you could probably snap your toes off.  Oh my God.  I think you could.  And you don't even have to chew those.  You could probably hammer fist your toes off. 
[00:30:30]  You could probably snap some toes off and then eat them like a big pill.  Right.  You know, just swallow them down without having to chew.  You think you could survive on one toe a day?  No.  You'd need at least three toes.  What about boogers?  No.  That's pretty much.  No nutritional value there?  No.  And your body is kind of making stuff like that.  And of course.  Stuff like that.  You'd have to drink your own pee.  You've got to drink your own urine.  You would have to do that.  So you would have some of your urine to wash down this tasty toe. 
[00:31:00]  You'd have to pee into your hands cupped.  Yeah.  And you would have to drink that.  But if you're floating in the water, you're going to have to do some weird floaty thing  where you elevate your hips, piss down your stomach and chest, and just kind of suck it up.  Oh my God.  This guy said I'd eat my testicles first.  There's no way.  No way you're going for your balls first.  See how they take our bit and they wreck it.  You can't.  There's no way. 
[00:31:30]  You would definitely try to rip an ear off.  Yeah.  And you could probably, if you really bite down, you could probably take off your pinky.  You could take off your pinky.  And maybe some flesh from your arm somehow.  From your arm.  Right there.  Right there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Think about it.  It's a little dull.  Uh-huh.  If you squeeze it, there's not...  Could do it.  ...not as much pain there.  You'd get something.  But now you don't want to disable your arms by chewing too much of the muscle off.  And how do you keep the bleeding down?  Although you probably could use the blood to help yourself out a little bit.  Yeah.  You might be able to drink that. 
[00:32:00]  You could drink the blood.  Until it stops bleeding.  Put it in the water.  And then the sharks come and get...  Oh, boy.  That's a problem right there.  The sharks.  Oh, JJ.  And, uh...  God, all the regulars checking in for that.  James!  Uh...  Jimmy James, New Hampshire.  What's up?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to let Obi know it takes only eight pounds of pressure to remove the  ear from the body.  Eight pounds of pressure to remove the ear?  Yeah.  You could do that.  Do you yank down?  Yeah.  How do you pull your ear off?  Or do you yank from the back?  Forward. 
[00:32:30]  Start at the top and pull down.  Eight pounds.  That's all it takes.  That's all it would take?  That's all it takes.  How bad would the bleeding be, though?  It's mainly cartilage.  I don't think there's that much blood feeding it.  I don't know.  You look like fucking Marvin Nash.  Imagine just...  Reservoir dogs.  Imagine you're in the middle of nowhere between Perth, Australia, and Antarctica, just floating  with your ear in your hand, knowing you got to now fucking eat this thing.  Shooing on it.  Do you just look at yourself and go, how did I get to this point?  Yeah, you would. 
[00:33:00]  You'd be like, man, in all of my fucking wildest hallucinations, I would never have thought...  I used to be a shark jock, goddammit.  I'd be in the middle of the fucking ocean eating my ear that I just ripped off of my  skull.  Eight pounds is all it takes.  Pounds, baby.  Pounds.  We got to do that bit.  Have someone rip their ear off for us.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get that through legal.  All right.  Take it easy, boys.  Thank you, JJ.  And we got a former Marine, Mike in Rockland. 
[00:33:30]  Mike.  Hurrah.  What's up, boys?  Hey, hello.  I was saying, you guys are barking at the wrong tree because they'd be dead of dehydration.  You could just go over a month without eating, but you need water pretty much within a few  days.  You can only drink your own piss twice.  But there's all that ocean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Drink up.  It's not going to be as good as piss.  Oh.  I have no doubt this plane is in the middle of the ocean and everyone's gone, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Which is very, very tragic.  Sean is full of shit with eight pounds of fucking pressure to pull a ear off. 
[00:34:00]  What do you think is the fucking trigger pull on an M-16?  Oh, shit.  Eight pounds.  It's way off.  Eight pounds, it seems too little.  Do you think if you hook an eight pound weight up to the top of your ear, do you think you'd  be able to pick it up off the ground without it ripping your ear off?  Wow.  That's a good question.  That's a good test.  Yeah?  Yeah, but you could, I mean, everyone has more than eight pounds of pressure they could  pull down on.  I don't think that's true, either.  I've been caught to the ground by an instructor from my ear, and I'm pretty sure he's more 
[00:34:30]  than eight pounds of pressure to put me in the front of your ear.  Oh, yeah?  Tough guy?  Yeah, but if you use both hands, it just fucking rip.  You could get it off if you need to eat it.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Whatever.  Two years, Ben.  All right, Mikey.  Punch it out.  How about you just start eating your mouth, like the bottom lip?  Well, I've been able to pull off a nice, you know, layer every once in a while.  Piece of skin.  You know, you feel a little something, next thing you know, you're just taking a whole  layer out.  And then you nibble between your front teeth, like... 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Horrible.  That would be terrible.  If you're to the point where you're eating yourself, I think all hope is lost.  Yeah.  All right.  After that, I'm hungry.  Submersibles.  Malaysia asking the U.S. for submersibles.  Of course.  We got the best submersibles.  And I bet you there's some drones in the sky.  I don't know if they could get drones out there.  People...  They said the drones, you know, could last a lot longer out there. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  They don't need as much fuel.  Flying out there?  Yeah.  Not many eyes, though, on a drone.  You get a plane like that Poseidon, you get some people peeking out the windows and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do they have to just eyeball it?  No, they got a lot of good equipment on those Poseidons.  They're meant to hunt submarines.  But they also got people, though, yeah, with like binoculars.  They're just looking out the windows, eyeballing it, and then the satellites.  1,500 miles offshore. 
[00:36:00]  God.  The middle of fucking nowhere.  That is the asshole of Earth right there.  Five aircraft searching for possible debris.  I really thought this was the day we'd have...  That's fucking over.  Confirmation.  It's over, Johnny.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We've got lots to do today.  It's Lady Di's last day as an intern.  Enjoy.  She's here.  Maybe we'll talk to her next.  Find out how her night went.  If she went to TGI Fridays, it went right home.  See what kind of condition she's in.  Because she's been progressively getting a little better as the week went on. 
[00:36:30]  Since Tuesday.  See if she...  Yeah, since Tuesday.  Right.  When she hit bottom on Tuesday.  She was really, really mad at me when she got in this morning.  Oh, don't, don't.  I want to hear about it after the break.  You've got it.  Also, we rushed planning a 41st anniversary tour.  Wow.  Okay.  I heard an ad for Jones Beach Theater, and it was like, Journey and the Steve Miller Band.  And I was like, what year is that?  Like, I had a fucking flashback that it was the 70s, early 80s, because it was the same 
[00:37:00]  voice.  See, Steve Miller.  And it's like, go on, take the money, run, and Journey any way you want it.  These bands have been going on forever.  Oh, my God.  Forever.  Yeah.  We got a lineup.  They got quite a lineup this year at Jones Beach.  Yeah.  Who else they got?  Barry Gibb.  Barry Gibb.  Cheryl Crowe.  What a lonely concert that must be for poor Barry Gibb.  Right.  All his brothers are dead.  Goo Goo Dolls. 
[00:37:30]  Journey, Steve Miller Band, and Tower of Power.  Tower of Power.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Backstreet Boys and Avril Lavigne.  I would see that shit.  I don't want to see...  Lionel Richie.  I don't want to see any of these.  Sticks and Foreigner.  And Don Felder.  And Don Felder, I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's that...  What are they calling that?  Oh, we just saw them on the news a few weeks ago.  They weren't calling it a supergroup.  They were calling it a merger or something like that.  Right, a merger.  I think that's what they said.  Boston.  Hey, do we have Boston's new song yet?  It's been out.  I think the album's been out since December. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, man.  Can we find the song...  I got to hear the single, because, you know, obviously they've moved on without Brad Delp.  That's got to be really strange.  Yeah, I want to hear what that guy sounds like.  Or maybe, you know, because of the production, anyone could have been Brad Delp.  Maybe.  I would hate to think anyone could be Brad Delp.  Yeah, yeah.  A, he was a great guy.  We met him a few times.  Yeah, and it could...  And B, I grew up with those Boston albums.  They were amazing.  Quite the range.  Well, the third one, not so much.  Not so much.  Although Cool the Engines wasn't that bad. 
[00:38:30]  But those first two were just every song.  Holy shit.  Album covers were Hang on the Wallable, too.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  A little album art.  Very crazy.  All right.  We also have a very, very hot lesbian story.  Oh.  Lesbian teachers.  Oh.  There's an update on a story we brought you, I don't know, maybe a year ago at this point.  Ooh.  Some hot lesbian teachers.  Hot lesbo action.  Got fired from a school for just doing hot lesbian things. 
[00:39:00]  Lesbian.  You're fired.  And now we got an update on that story.  Yeah.  Also, the Louis C.K. clip is hilarious.  That is so good.  I don't know.  Is it a visual, you think?  I don't think so.  No.  I think you could describe it.  Why do you have it in two parts here?  The first part is the Louis part, and then the second part is the other clip.  Yeah.  That way we go, hey, remember Louis C.K. said this.  Yeah, but do you have the clip from American Hustle that ends it?  I mean, we could get it, yeah.  No, that's what makes it hilarious.  Well, once it's all together, but it's just an interesting talking point to be like, here's 
[00:39:30]  this clip, and then that.  Oh, right.  You know what I mean?  That's the visual part is the American Hustle.  Right, right.  To me.  Brick.com did a great job with this one.  If you want to go there.  It's hilarious.  And then there's also the Billy Joel clip.  Did you hear him with the?  No.  We didn't start the fire?  No.  That's a good one.  He, I guess he's at Madison Square Garden where he's been playing, and he fucked up  We Didn't Start the Fire, and he comments about it.  You can't fuck up that song, because it throws off the entire, is that?  Exactly what it is. 
[00:40:00]  You can't mess up one word in that song, or you're so fucked.  Verbatim.  Okay, okay.  And then he starts talking about the song.  Oh, cool.  I gotta hear this.  It's funny.  It's a great clip.  We'll do it after the break.  Yeah, there it is.  Yeah.  Oh.  Thumbs up?  Yeah.  Nirvana Unplugged?  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  It sticks you right back, doesn't it, everybody?  Taking you right back to the 90s.  I still listen to this Unplugged.  It's a good Unplugged.  In my car when I'm driving around.  It's a good Unplugged.  One of the best.  Yeah.  Alice in Chains.  Alice in Chains right up there, man.  Those two, man, I couldn't leave the house without for a long time.  Yeah.  A lady dies on a walk she had to make.  Okay. 
[00:41:00]  She's being walked like a dog.  Yes.  Like someone has to take her out, walk her, and then bring her back.  I wanted to go out, so we had to let her out.  Oh, was she by the door scratching?  New photos of Kurt Cobain's suicide found by police after sitting undeveloped for 20 years  in the evidence room.  Why wouldn't you just develop that stuff?  You'd think.  But I guess the guy that took the pictures, he saw it, so he's like, ah, I saw all this  stuff.  I'll put it in the cabinet somewhere. 
[00:41:30]  And they released a couple of the pictures, and there's nothing really there.  Nothing real.  As Travis was showing me this morning.  A little box of drug paraphernalia, a cigar box.  Right.  And then, like, just some personal stuff.  And then that wacky winter hat he used to wear.  His wacky hat with the ear flaps.  What is, cool glasses.  I would love those glasses.  You didn't need that hat after that, huh?  No.  No.  That's for sure.  How do I get Kurt Cobain's glasses?  I think if you just put that out on the air, somebody, I'm sure, will send them to you.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Nice.  And then there's, like, a golf towel.  Yeah.  Big golfer, was he?  And then, uh, what else is in that picture?  His wallet, like you said, with his ID.  Big hitter to Cobain.  Where is those pictures if the people want to see them?  They're all over.  We'll put them on, uh, O&A show on Twitter.  Okay.  Yep.  Wee.  Wee.  Were we going to play the Billy Joel clip, you think?  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we do that?  I'm trying to figure out this new Boston album.  I guess.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  I guess they found Brad, some tracks Brad Delp did before he died, so they kind of threw  those together somehow to make songs.  And then you were telling me, Travis, they have, like, guest vocalists on the rest of  the album or something?  Yeah.  I believe I described it as a hodgepodge.  A hodgepodge.  Oh.  I think, like, four of the songs they have Delp on.  Right.  And then there's a bunch of other people doing lead vocals on some of these other tracks.  Are they trying to sound like Delp?  I have no.  You think I really listen to this entire time?  I didn't think you did.  But no one's talking about this, Boston. 
[00:43:00]  Nothing.  I've asked a few times in the last few weeks, and not one phone call on it.  We don't know what song they're working.  Yeah.  Because bands have to work a song to try to get the interest up.  Sure.  It sold 16,000 copies on its first week.  Ouch.  And then after three weeks, it was off the Billboard 200.  Oh.  Ouch.  It's very hard to do now.  Ouch.  That's sad.  All right.  Well.  Want to hear, like, a track?  Hey, I hope Sibby's okay.  Yeah, Sibby and the band.  He'll be back now on my show. 
[00:43:30]  Let me see.  What was he, a drummer?  Yeah.  Where's drums?  Tom Schultz did drums?  Tom Schultz did drums?  Well, he certainly could do that.  He's a genius in the studio.  No.  The personnel for this band, this record, is Tom Schultz, guitar, bass, guitar, keyboards,  drums, vocals.  And then everybody else is listed as vocals.  Wow.  This might just be his project.  That's weird. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  So he pasted this thing together in a studio somewhere.  Yep.  And it didn't do well for him.  Tom Schultz is a genius as far as working in a studio.  He knows his shit.  It's kind of like how Dave Grohl did the first Foo Fighters record.  There you go.  Is it really?  Yeah.  No Sibby.  He wrote and recorded that entire record.  Wow.  And then he got a band.  Maybe Sib was busy with the PFG TV show.  Yeah, he's got other things going on.  I think Dave Grohl, back in the day, handed in some songs to Kurt.  And Kurt's like, go away. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, this shit sucks.  Go away.  And he was just holding on to those songs for a while and finally got to put them out.  Kurt, I got gold here.  I got some good shit.  You got to think some of those songs could easily have been Nirvana songs.  Oh, yeah.  If Kurt was willing to listen to Dave Grohl a little more.  Let's see the Billy Joel clip.  Yeah, this is him at the garden.  Yeah.  And he's doing We Didn't Start the Fire.  Okay.  And I guess he gets a little tripped up, but he doesn't play through it. 
[00:45:00]  He stops the song.  Uh-oh.  just totally off yeah all you have to do is put up one word and so on and it's a train wreck

[00:55:30]  because the diabetic uh burrito  one of the teachers  needed some candy  to stabilize her blood sugar  there you go  why do you give her candy  with her shirt off  shirt off  maybe she was sweating  and the night of lust  started with the teachers  going to a bar  and knocking back drinks  there you go  it was room 337 by the way  where one was seen naked  from the waist up  and the other was on her knees  just ready to fucking go  then the stupid janitor  what's wrong with you  your job already sucks  and you get to see something cool

[00:59:00]  with what happened  to you after the show  ended  because people are  curious  they're always curious  as to what you do  she just worked  her own volume knob  by the way  she has picked up  on a lot  well I found  the cafe downstairs  and I scrubbed  my face  oh right  she had the makeup  on remember  downstairs  did you get  everybody staring  at me  did you get  some looks  going down  the elevator  and walking  through the lobby  I hear you're  mad at Sam  I am mad at him  why  I love him  but I'm mad at him  why  because he didn't 
[00:59:30]  let me wash up  up here  before I went  downstairs  you weren't  allowed to use  the bathrooms  I'm not allowed  to use the bathroom  I wasn't going  to use the bathroom  I was just going  to use the sink  to wash up  management was  going to shut us  down  you're not allowed  to walk into  the bathroom  never mind  the sink  or anything  they didn't want  you back here  we had to negotiate  and work it out  yes  and that's what  we worked out  as long as you  didn't use the  bathrooms here  you were allowed  to come back  for the rest of the week  and internships  are about life lessons  and you've learned  that your behavior  has consequences 
[01:00:00]  and the saw makeup  was a huge hit  huge hit  that's scary  I'm going to remind  people that  when I pass  the hat around  yes please  we're going to  pass the hat  that's scary  that's just nuts  Lady Di  we're going to  pass the hat  around for you  besides the money  that I promised  you and promised  you  we're going to  try to get  a little extra  from everybody  else here  but please don't  go and just  binge drink  with our money  what are you  going to do  with the money  I'm going to  go right home  and then what 
[01:00:30]  are you going to  do with this money  I'm going to  go right home  ok  can I stop  and at least  have one drink  that one  it's impossible  to have one drink  you can do it  people can do it  you're not going  to do it  I'm going to  go home  and  hold on  so after the show  yesterday  you left here  with the saw  makeup on  you went down  to the cafe  downstairs  I was mad  like that  and I only had  two dollars 
[01:01:00]  in my pocket  and you washed  up in a sink  down there  I washed up  in a sink  down there  how hard  was it  to get  the makeup  off  five minutes  oh good  ok  that means  that's hard  to get off  that's not bad  no  five minutes  that's great  I thought  it would be  a lot longer  it's on your  old face  believe me  I try to rush  as fast as I  can trying to  get the stuff  out  did anyone  say anything  on your way  down  did anyone  say hey  it's saw  no  I just got  a lot of  looks  I was cursing 
[01:01:30]  under my breath  and everything  I said  bye bye  I want to come  back today  have a little  fun  having a little  fun  a little fun  it was fun  it was dumb  makeup on your  face  we didn't make you  do anything crazy  this week  to be honest with you  we were scared  that was the  biggest thing  you had me do  physically you don't  look like you're in  any shape to do  anything  stalker patty  the stuff we've had  her do over the years  wearing makeup  is nothing  she would have  loved to just wear  makeup  she shaved her head  two or three times 
[01:02:00]  she had to crawl around  naked to get money  mousetraps  mousetraps  yeah  that's true too  did we put the  mousetrap bit on  our podcast  oh we should  that was a good one  that was an amazing day  take the wig  right  remember take the wig  maybe you could walk  around naked  and get your money  today  walk around  nah I don't think so  I mean on your  hands and knees  maybe  hands and knees  yeah that's another  one I don't think so  so what happened  after the makeup  you went home  I went right home  okay and I just  shook my head 
[01:02:30]  right  and I just  you know  I couldn't believe it  and then Bill  started to get on my case  oh what did Bill  get mad at  he's like I'll bet you  you went to TGIFs  after the show  I said no  I did not go to TGIFs  after the show  I'm home  didn't I  this guy cares about you  but maybe you smelled  alcohol on your breath  did you have any alcohol  on the way home  how  I don't know  with what  grab a beer  maybe you grab a beer  you got no money right  I could have used the credit card  but why would I do that  Penn Station has all those  beers and ice for people  oh boy 
[01:03:00]  no I didn't do that  I wouldn't do something like that  so why would he accuse you  of going to TGIF  because  I guess he knows  how long this show is  right  okay  but he doesn't know  how long Sam's show is  it's not Sam's show  it's a post show  well whatever  it's the after show  whatever it is  Sam's made of the show  and you know  and then the train  you have to take the  taxi to the train  and so on and so forth  and I was like  alright so after  you convinced him  you didn't go to TGIF  how was the rest of your night  how was the rest of my 
[01:03:30]  oh gee  I was just plain old tired  that's all  yeah  plain old tired  did you have any natties  of course I did  of course  how many natties  um  I don't know  around maybe 5 or 6 or 7  5 or 6 or 7  which means 8, 9 or 10  holy shit  5 or 6 or 7  yeah  and uh  dude I swear to you  and I'm probably just a wimp  if I did 6 or 7 beers  after the show yesterday  I would not be here today  I would not be able to function  my hangover would be shitty 
[01:04:00]  you don't drink  no I know  I used to be  but my tolerance is way the fuck down  that'd be right  even just a couple  that's what happens  you know  I'm a pussy  but um  anyway  so wait  so you had 6 or 7 beers  safe to say  are you feeling it at all today  no  god I don't understand that  nothing huh  I guess your body just what  adjusts to it  yeah  tolerance  you build up a tolerance  you don't have a headache  you don't feel shitty  you don't feel  no  no  well I do feel a little  you know  a little down  because I didn't get too much sleep 
[01:04:30]  last night  why  she was drinking  I was  no I  I had a couple hours  you know  because I watch TV  and then in front of the TV  just  you know  just lay there  you know  the thing is too  um  I don't know  about an hour later  uh huh  all right  you know  Bill took a nap  he gets up  and he goes  go to the store  oh boy  I said  you gotta be kidding  threw you right out of there  why did you have to go to the store  yesterday for him  I had to get two six packs  for him  and he says  here go ahead  get yourself two six packs  also  oh hey  does he drive  he 
[01:05:00]  yeah he does drive  so why doesn't he leave the house  he just figures  that I'm home  I can go out  and get it  but he's been there all day  why doesn't he go out at all  he doesn't go out  he doesn't like going out  and he was yelling and screaming  that you need rehab  when you were on the phone  with Dr. Steve  but he's buying you two six packs  now is this after you've already  this is after you've already  had a few beers  yeah  and then you get in a car  and drive to the liquor store  he can drive  believe me  oh my god  well you know  listen  don't drink and drive 
[01:05:30]  oh my god  I got him his two packs of cigarettes  and I got myself a pack  he said put it on the card  you know  he put money  he took money from his bank  and put it on the card  because you know  we got bills coming up  wait so  how many beers did you drink  before you went driving  about three  that's it  we can't condone that  I don't think anyone  well you know  I mean  I don't know what's the matter with him  he could have went out  and got everything  while I was  while I was here  right  but he didn't 
[01:06:00]  so  he just waited  till I got home  he goes  what took me so long  he was a lazy bum  he goes  I bet you  went to TGIF  I said no  I took the bus home  because all I had  was two dollars on me  so why doesn't he pick you up  I don't know  she had 140 fucking dollars  the other day  and she's got two dollars  on her today  right  that's why  she had two dollars  I swear I don't want to pay her today  I know  it's crazy  you're going to get paid  don't worry  and then you're going to go  to TGIF  and you're going to blow 
[01:06:30]  fucking all the money  on beer  no Anthony  I'm not going to do that  you're going to spend  all this money on beer  I said I'm not going to do it  this time  I don't believe you  do I have to yell at you  you could yell all you want  I don't believe you  Sam's going around right now  I think you're  dishonest with everyone  and yourself  you are going to  whatever money we give you  most of it  I'm going to say right now  most of it  is going to go to beer  no  we have to do other things  with that money too  you've got to invest it  yeah  invest in what  beer 
[01:07:00]  what are you going to do  with the money  I've got some cheap  Citadel stock  if you want  what's an earmark  for that money  Bill already went food shopping  so we don't have to do that  good  more for beer  so he did get  he went out of the house  to go food shopping  yeah St. Patrick's Day  he got the things  for St. Patrick's Day  and he goes  if you don't believe  I went shopping  open up the freezer  alright whatever  what is your share  you're going to get  a couple hundred bucks  a little more  whatever  what are you going  to spend it on  probably some more clothes 
[01:07:30]  I guess  clothes  we'll have to call her Monday  I guarantee  she spends all the money  before Monday  do you want me to show  your receipts  or something  or what  no just be honest  with us  when we call you  on Monday  no you're going  to buy beer  because people  will want an update  and food  you know  alright  whatever we need  so you brought  some ideas  for the show today  yeah  oh that I want to hear  Sam has them  well Sam's got them  Sam's passing the hat around  trying to get you  even more money  you know he got the ideas  another good idea  is  you remember that  another  you didn't even  give us one 
[01:08:00]  yeah  well alright  well this is the one  I didn't write down  oh ok  alright  you could have  guests  from the studio  in here  I don't know about  you guys  if you ever  want to leave  your seats  and do this  but you know  that song  Hot Hot Hot  when they do  that chain  and they go around  they go around  like around here  and stuff like that  the conga line  yeah  yeah  alright  and you could do  that with the guests  so we  so you have  we go through  the halls  of  over here  around here  like  right 
[01:08:30]  we're going to do  a conga  is it conga  or a conga  I think it's  conga line  David Johansson's song  right  feeling hot  hot hot  yeah  you missed the first idea  that's not on the sheet  Sam  oh  tell Sam  okay  you do a conga line  right  whatever guests  we have in here  hot hot hot  and you have the guests  and everything go  and then we go around  oh so that's the  that's the spin  that makes it unique  that you're playing  hot hot hot  instead of  you go around  dancing and stuff like that  oh  and then we do it 
[01:09:00]  and it's festive  and what people in the hall  will laugh  and everything  maybe join in  yeah that could be  yeah yeah  we gotta try it  Sam  yeah I mean  I'm writing down now  hold on  hold on  another song is  Love Train  I think that's by the OJ's  it is by the OJ's  right  and they do the conga line  to that too  oh they do  yeah they do  never heard that  I saw it done  is there any way  we could see what it would look like  I mean we don't have a line  but maybe just like one person  well one person  like could you demo  what that would look like  right yeah 
[01:09:30]  Mary thought of some of these things too  oh boy  of course she did  by the way  people are reminding us  that the Natty Ices  are a lot stronger than regular beers  that's true  so if you're having  5.9  5.9  and they got an extra ounce now  or something  yeah  5.9  what's a regular Bud  3  actually it's a little higher now  I think it's 3.5  if I'm not mistaken  so 6 or 7 Natty Ices  safe to say  is at least 10 Budweisers  11  it's a lot  maybe about 11 Budweisers  don't forget that I eat 2  you know  I mean you know  it's not a lot 
[01:10:00]  what did you eat last night  oh I had corned beef and cabbage  oh boy  and potatoes  oh boy  I feel bad for Starbucks  oh boy  what do you mean  splatter up those bowls maybe  huh  I'm not going to Starbucks today  no why  where'd you go  I don't feel like going today  I don't want to go to Starbucks  she was down in the Metro Cafe  it was just another place like Starbucks  yeah  it was the same thing  it's actually a step down from Starbucks  isn't it  yeah  it's closer though  let's say here are your other ideas  you want to read them yourself  you read them

[01:26:30]  that way  you do your little show  I used to have an aunt  every wedding  every wedding  hey  hey Greg  why don't you go up there  show the DJ how it's done  oh  oh  oh  and I would tell her  look I haven't played music  on the radio in years  yeah  stop  my favorite is  hey hey wait  someone will come walking over  when you're talking to someone  and go  hey hey look out  what you say to this guy 
[01:27:00]  he'll put it on his radio  oh  that's the fucking worst  it's like no  I've had that so many times  I don't want to end up  in your act  yeah yeah  what kind of narcissistic asshole  thinks I'm going to go  write about them  yeah  this conversation  it's just full of such  witty reparts  hey  oh you're like Carson  you're in his prime  you're just so full of bars  could you wait  until I get something  to jot down  what you're saying  or I record it  because I don't want  to miss a word  I don't want to miss a word  yeah yeah  I don't want to miss a word  exactly  yeah 
[01:27:30]  don't know  to be careful  with this guy  look out  he's a comedian  fuck  oh  oh  oh  you guys are going to do  the podcast live  in Jersey City  I just noticed that  April 1st man  the whole crew  April 5s  that's what you would say  I went to the  I went to the Rich and Bonnie one  it was unbelievable  how fun  that was a lot of fucking fun  oh and you did time  yeah  I opened up  I did some stand up up top  yeah it was great  it was put together  really well 
[01:28:00]  Bobby knows how to produce man  dude Bobby  fucking Bobby Incognito  that's my nickname for him  hey  like that dolphin lineman  that's who he is  imagine Bobby being like  if Bobby was an offensive lineman  being like  dude you're not part of the team  dude  come on dude  come on board  smooth though  oh man  he ran his production  April 1st  it's at the  where in Jersey  somewhere in Jersey City  Jersey City I believe  it's called Jersey City  the venue  I think no  I don't know where the venue is  you can't just tell people  it's in Jersey City  just get off the train 
[01:28:30]  in Jersey City  and wander around  until you figure it out  until you find it  let's see how big of a fan  of the podcast  you really are  I just said that  Bobby's really good  at producing  and then it gives me  a shitty date here  well you also asked  the stoner on the show  so I'm like  I don't know man  it's somewhere there  just take the bath train  you smoking more dope  because it's legal  in Colorado  I was just there  and it's  they fucking nailed it  did they figure it out  they nailed it  what do you mean  it's awesome  it's just awesome  it's like 
[01:29:00]  I remember when I first  started smoking pot  and you have that epiphany  where you're like  this is way safer  than alcohol  and you're like  they should sell it  well Colorado just did  what every stoner  thought they should do  you know you give  your license to a cop  and you stand in line  and you talk to his secretary  and then she's like  what's your name  and then they take  your license  and then you go  stand in another line  and then they say  the most adorable thing ever  where they're like  uh Dan  your bud tender  Rory's ready to see you  and you turn the corner 
[01:29:30]  to this little stoner  who's like  what's up man  your bud tender  yeah and he's just like  he's blown away  by everything you ask him  I'm like  I don't know  I'm looking at his  he's like  I asked him  I was like  I want one of those  hash pens  and he goes  oh yeah  he got like super excited  he's like  look  and he pulled one  from around his neck  like on a necklace  I was like  alright dude  you're fucking taking  your work a little too seriously  is he really a bud tender  that's what they're called  what's the deal  with the cop thing though  they uh  you know  they monitor  to make sure you're 21  they  oh so it's just for taking  um 
[01:30:00]  ID  why do they use a cop  I mean I think  they probably want to keep it  extremely legal  yeah they're trying to do  everything perfect  so the federal government  can't be like  can't be like  yeah  that's fucking done  you let an 18 year old  buy weed  if it's not a cop  then you get just some guy  and all of a sudden  it's going to be illegal  you get a black  you get a black water  underage or whatever  yeah yeah  what do you got to be 18  21  it is 21  and it's uh  they like  you know  they air seal the bag  no no  slow down a little bit  so now you've got your  bud tender  I'm talking to Rory 
[01:30:30]  he's loving life  but does he talk to you  about what kind of buzz  you want  or what  what does he say  he's like  I told him  I was like  I want some  you know  I want a head high  I want a good high  that doesn't knock me out  and stuff  he's like  we're going to get  and the names are  fucking hilarious  because he's like  we're going to get you  some orange blossom  butt fuck  and then you're like  I don't even know  what that is  but that's going to  keep you up  and I'm like  alright  he's like  then we'll get you  some indiga  for your  you know  good body high 
[01:31:00]  and I ended up  dropping like  fucking 400 bucks  really  oh they had  they just  everything  they keep pulling  everything up  is it cases like  Starbucks with  with their pastries  is it all just  kind of laid out  nice  they have it  more like  baskets  and they're like  they can go through  and like  pull it out  and they pull out  like little pill cases  and show you the buds  and they're like  what are you  and I'm like  do you get to smell it  yeah  I love the smell of pot  yeah  it was  it was surreal  it's just surreal  no shit  and those hash pens  are a problem  oh shit 
[01:31:30]  they're the best  you like those  love them  what is that  like a G pen  yeah it's a G pen  right  and it's  I got the oil  I'm not going to lie  so it's hash oil  yeah I think it's just THC oil  I'm not sure if it's actually hash  some  an alpha stoner  will probably  I remember the hash oil  we used to put it on tin foil  and then you'd get a lighter  underneath the tin foil  and take a straw  and when it starts bubbling  and smoking  you'd suck in all the hash oil  fucking smoke  I used to love smoking hash  in college 
[01:32:00]  under a glass  hash was the other thing  you would take the little thing of hash  put it on the tin  in the book  yeah I didn't do the oil  just under the glass  you'd let it get all smoky  lift it up slightly  and just  I remember the first time  this kid in high school  like shaved off  a little bit of hash  on our bowl  and he's like  make sure the flame hits it  for a while  and I hit it  and I was like  I'm not moving  I'm done  so then  you pick out your bud  and then what happens  bring us down  the entire line  I mean the guy  there's never been a person  I've never bought something 
[01:32:30]  where the person  working in retail  is as excited  about the product  as you are  yeah yeah  almost  I think the Apple store  is the only place  I've been where they're like  this is pretty awesome  we love the product  we're selling  yeah  and it's like  people in the weed stores  they're like  oh man  they're like excited  for you  and then Rory  he threw in a free pipe  wow  because I bought  I bought a couple  eighths  and he was like  super excited  and he's like  and then of course  they get you 
[01:33:00]  it's so funny  this is how much  marketing  has influenced  everything  immediately right  after I buy  a legal weed  for the first time  he goes  if you could fill out  this survey  on weed maps  it would really  be appreciated  so I download  the app of weed maps  and it shows you  all the dispensaries  in Denver  and it's fucking insane  it's just  oh there's shitload  it's a ton  is there any  kind of cafes yet  no  they don't have that  are they allowed  to set those up  I don't think  I think they're trying  to stay  I think they're trying  to stay  so in the right 
[01:33:30]  right  but can you smoke  in the place  you just  no  you can't  smoke  they airlock it  they make sure  you leave  there's no  they're really  that sucks  because you can't  really just socialize  with everyone else  that's in that space  here's the thing  that Denver's doing  though they've kind  of made it  where almost  it's like  Denver's being  classy without  being prompted to  like you can walk  outside of a bar  and where people  are smoking cigarettes  someone's maybe  smoking a bowl  oh okay  and then you can be like  hey  but it's much more  social than cigarettes  because you're like  I got a little weed  you want to smoke 
[01:34:00]  I'll smoke some weed  with you  and then you're both  you know  a little jittery  and nervous  I've said a few times  but when we did  the comedy festival  in Montreal  walking around Montreal  and smelling pot  everywhere  and no one  was misbehaving  yeah  every part  Montreal has so many  little parks  with so many  cool things going on  and everyone was  just high as shit  yeah Joe  my buddy Joe List  and I  hilarious comedian  we hiked  Mount Royale  when we were in Montreal  and we kept  just smelling weed 
[01:34:30]  all the way up  right  and I was like  let's follow it  right  and he was like  I don't think  you'll  you know  I think a lot  of people get nervous  about smoking weed  in Canada  if you're from America  because you don't want to  yeah you don't know  you don't want to be  locked up abroad  by a Mountie  right  it's officially legal  in Montreal  right  it has to be  because you smell it  everywhere  when you're taking  walks  huh  I think it's super  decriminalized  yeah I don't think  anyone really fucks  with you  it's not legal  but wow  so they  yeah they're just  completely looking  the other way 
[01:35:00]  then  because way more  you smell it  way more than  walking around  Central Park  or anywhere else  in New York City  certainly  well now you  want to smell me  because I have  a vape pen  a vape pen  motherfucker  I was telling  I got a G pen  but I'm not  I'm not in yet  I'm such a wimp  I kind of want  to start smoking pot  again  dude I'll tell you  this  I told E-Rock  before I came on  it was supposed  to be for the road  I was going to  take it on the road  so I didn't have  to ask people  for weed  now I have to  leave it at home  because it's just  it's got to be  a problem  it's just 
[01:35:30]  just a problem  it was just like  in silk pajamas  like in an opium den  yesterday  just sitting there  with a little blue  light blinking  going  what was that  knock at the door  oh shit  it's amazing  it's fucking amazing  people want to know  how much you're paying  per gram  James in Canada  wants that answer  a little bit more  I think it's around  I mean  someone from Colorado  could correct me  I was so blown away  by the whole thing  that I'm not going to lie  they could have  ripped me off  right right  it's so 
[01:36:00]  like when the lady  asked me  she's like  why are you here  I'm like  to buy weed legally  and she goes  okay  alright  like they get that  a lot  do you think  I was thinking  about this  the other day  do you think  every state  could handle this  nah  I've been thinking  about states  and which ones  could absolutely  handle the  legalized  marijuana thing  but I don't think  it's for every state  no  I just don't  I've lived in  New York  I've lived in  New York  can handle it  yes  Colorado can handle it  I've lived in Arizona  I don't 
[01:36:30]  Arizona and Florida  would fuck it up  those two places  I think  I think  because it's  they would do  something where  it would get weird  they always like  they would mess it up  I feel like  they would just be like  what other states  couldn't handle their  their legalized marijuana  I think anywhere  there's inner city  crime problems  I think there might  be an issue  with people  hanging out  around it  or  trying to be like  yeah man  I got you  I got it cheaper  or maybe  slugging someone 
[01:37:00]  in the face  as they walk  out of the place  I'll tell you this  if someone would  have hit me  when I walked out  they would have  been rich  with weed  the Pacific Northwest  no problem  no problem  I mean it already  is almost like that  it's funny to see  all these places  it's that east coast  thing that's a little  shady I think  Philly  Maine  no problem  New Hampshire  Rhode Island  no problem  Philly would be a  fucking problem  Detroit would be a  huge problem  a problem  Washington D.C.

[01:40:00]  of the first time  you go to a strip club  in a liquor store  wow  mixed with the safety  of a doctor's office  you feel safe  and the whole time  you're probably sitting there  going  wait this is really legal  you feel like  you're going to get  fucked at any moment  this is a big scam  wow  and you  there's so many people  trying to get in  that you have  you have cops  waving you in  and direct traffic  and the cops  are giving you  you know  thumbs up  on the way in  that's awesome  wow  even the cops  fucked up  cops know  that no one's

[01:43:00]  yes  planes  I worked as an  air traffic controller  for 14 years  oh really did you  yeah  wow  that is something  landings and takeoffs  oh yeah  so you know  we figured maybe  you could ask them  a few questions  about the Malaysian  airplane situation  if you're interning  for the show  we like teaching  the interns  a little  about radio  and broadcasting  and one thing  that you're going  to have to do  is our interviews  what  I wrote down  her questions  for her  these are actually  hers  and we dictated  them  we had interviews  with a porn star 
[01:43:30]  with the guy  from Pawn Stars  it was like  entertainment  this is more  don't forget about  the games  Game of Thrones  Game of Thrones  guy  oh my god  but this one  now is a different  take on the interview  this is more  news  so this is a little  more hard hitting  a little more serious  so that's what  we're looking for  well don't listen  she's just  rambling on  it's almost like  you guys are in a  marriage  and you're just  trying to explain 
[01:44:00]  something  whatever  before you get  to your questions  there's a guy  hopefully a call back  oh he is calling  back  there he is  put your headphones  on he's got a  proposition for you  okay wait  hold on  oh god  that is a cool  shirt you got  on Lady Di  hold on  Cedric in Tennessee  I knew that  hold on  there's too much  going on  hold on Lady Di  you're on hold  for a minute  Cedric loves to  the fact that  we said most  black cities  would fuck up  the free marijuana  thing  he's black  but he loves it  let's see what 
[01:44:30]  he says  Cedric go ahead  what's happening  fellas  what's up Cedric  man I love  your fucking show  man  I knew  I knew  she was a  fucking skinhead  but I'm  kind of disappointed  you guys  just named  all the blackest  people  you didn't  have no fucking  weed  come on man  come on  you don't think  that shit  would get all  fucked up  actually no  the blackest  cities are like  Gary Indiana  and Peoria  Illinois  we're not even  going with like  the really black  cities 
[01:45:00]  in all fairness  hold on  hold on  because we don't  we don't know  that world  obviously  so as a black  gentleman  what black city  could handle  the free  the free  the legal marijuana  thing  Atlanta Georgia  absolutely  you think Atlanta  could handle it  I wanted to give a  pass to Atlanta Georgia  when you said Atlanta  I do feel  because it's just like  New York  well I'll give Atlanta  San Francisco of the  South  yeah yeah  it really is  I think Atlanta could  probably figure it out  I think Oakland could  oh shit 
[01:45:30]  no way  I think Oakland could do it  no fucking way  I'll put my money on Oakland  there'd be just a line of beatings  when you walk out the fucking place  I think Oakland does it  you're high right now sir  a little bit  the knockout game  and then fucking run off with your weed  oh come on  the knockout game  is just a lie  told by the white media  to scare rural white people  was that it  damn I thought so  what about Jersey  not now  not now  yeah  what Camden  what about Jersey  Camden no 
[01:46:00]  Camden would have a problem  West Orange  Newark would have a problem  Newark would have a problem  I think Jersey could deal with it  yeah  Cedric's gone  alright  a few bad parts  but  anyway  here's a call for you Lady Di  you got your headphones on  yes I do  she's got a wacky  fucking clown wig on  how are you  I'm good  what are you doing like sitting right next to  move over  give Dan some fucking room  somebody  she's a little horny  Lady Di  she's a little horny  move the fuck over  somebody  somebody's already  somebody's already asked me  sorry about that Dan  now move the mic

[01:50:00]  no no  okay good  okay  it doesn't matter  if you're not fucking each other  the thing is  you're looking at each other's  dumb fuck faces  that you make  yeah that would be a problem  I don't want to see my brother's fuck face  dick and shit  nah  I don't want to see that  you gotta hear the uh  it's always in the devil's threesome  the guy always does the same noise  when he's getting blown  and the porn  oh yeah yeah  fuck yeah  and then there's  oh  and then there's  and then there's a possibility  your brother's dick is bigger  and that'll pitch it off

[01:51:00]  you know  I've seen his dumb face  my whole life  we both know that  I'm a little bit bigger  oh right  it's not a big deal  how big are you  well you're going to have to find out  but I'm going to say  oh  you better send me a picture  hey  she's getting all amped up  you know what I learned this week  she's horned up  she's got the time  oh fucking frothed  she's a frothing mess of horn dog  and now stands over there  getting a little jealous  that's okay  I don't want to be 
[01:51:30]  I don't want to be stepping on Colin Quinn's toes  but uh  that's true  so you're going to go out with Eric or what  and his brother  if they send me a picture  I want to see what they look like  they already know what I look like  can you send  I know what you look like  huh  excuse me  I know what you look like  well I don't know what you look like  so you've got to send a picture  through the uh  through the uh  email address  you do realize you're a two  right  oh shit  what was that  how did you give her one 
[01:52:00]  just be nice  that's me being nice  that is a one  what's  a one for what  but I was being nice  because I feel like I know her now  I  I  I  I graded on a little bit of a curve  yeah  a sweetness curve  okay  maybe missing body parts  could be worse  I don't know  you think that's a one  we're looking at a one  it's gotta be a one  that's a  a solid one  but a two is bad too  two is terrible  so I think one is worse than that  I don't know 
[01:52:30]  yeah  I'm not a conceited guy  but I'm gonna say  we're  we're about seven  no  but let's say  wait we're about seven  so combined you're a seven  combined  no no no  so they're a solid seven  so  14 inch of brother dick  right  don't do it  lady died  do you want 14 inch of jersey brother dick  ha ha  ha ha  um  let me see  that's your two  I like that she's  I like that she's  14 inches  no they're  they're  they're both seven  it'd be two sevens

[01:53:30]  alright so Dan's an expert  on aviation  and uh  we've asked all the questions  already so we figured  we'd give you a shot  to kind of interview  an expert on the Malaysian air  okay  air disaster  14 years  takeoffs and landings  okay  that's all I watched  that's great  that's right  no crashes  on my watch  oh nice  yeah that's good  clean record  it's your question  you started out  in a little airfield  in South Dakota  work my way up to Dulles  nice  the big  I mean the big leagues  are JFK and LaGuardia  I never got there 
[01:54:00]  but I got to do O'Hare  for three months  okay  it's pretty good  go ahead  alright Lady Di  okay  do you think there were  Russian terrorists  on board that airplane  oh  Russian terrorists  well I mean  the first thing you gotta look at  is flight plan  that was clearly  interrupted  right  so I mean  I don't think that we have  enough facts on board  yeah  to determine if they're terrorists  but I know from the  direction of the flight  that there was interference  and both sonars were taken off  and if you know anything  about aviation  I mean your first day  in aviation school  they teach you  yeah  you know 
[01:54:30]  the satellites don't  shut themselves off  that's true  that's true  are you listening to his answer  yes I am  I am  a good interviewer  you listen to the answer  and then maybe  you play off the answer  we're trying to teach you here  right  alright  um  wait hold on  hold on  I like the wind chime ringtone  in the back  that's my phone  it gives me anxiety  she doesn't answer her phone  it drives me nuts  when it's ringing  she goes like this  it takes it forever  she fiddles  it's ringing  ringing  she's fiddling with it  and you're like  answer it  no one  no one let you ring 
[01:55:00]  for ten times  like the old days  did you answer that one  in time  no  no  how are you  you're getting so many calls  oh my god  isn't that something  I mean  hopefully it's Eric from Jersey  Anthony's picture is gone now  okay  what  your picture is the wallpaper  on the phone  I really like her  why is it gone  I really like her 60s  60s NFL lineman face  I'll explain later  George Clinton's paper lions  over here  Alex Karras 
[01:55:30]  can you put up a picture of Alex Karras  look like that  looks like that  go with Alex Karras  looks like she played a lot  Alex Karras  we might have to get her an old school  yeah  looks like she played O-line with just the bar  oh yeah  just that one  it's Alex Karras  go Google images  him a little older even  oh the one up in the  Webster  go on  just Webster  right corner  right there  oh shit  oh god  that's you  we got a new one for her 
[01:56:00]  you look like Alex Karras  George  George  Popolopoulos  from Webster  yeah  or Mongo  from Blazing Saddles  Candygram  from Mongo  Candygram  from  that's funny  why did you think there were Russian terrorists on the plane  yeah  Dan how are the Russian terrorists sound  I don't know  why Russian though  I don't know  I have no idea  Dan knows how Russian terrorists sound  do you want to ask him  well wasn't the  she just blew right by that set up  did the airplane come from Russia 
[01:56:30]  well  where did the airplane come from  I mean that's a great  that's a great question  now any aviation expert  would probably be able to tell by the fin  however I haven't seen the fin  so I wouldn't know  but I would probably say that some parts were assembled in Russia  they have a  the high  export of  aviation  Boeing  tools  Boeing  tools  she  she's giving you the bedroom high  she know that right  oh  I feel like a tackle from the Rams  in 67  I feel like I'm blitzing the quarterback 
[01:57:00]  at old  at the old polo grounds  oh  oh my god  yes  very much  I'm married  he's kidding  I have a girlfriend  okay  there is some chemistry there though  isn't there  Sam's a little  I'm gonna fucking kill you  Colin's gonna get jealous  Colin is what we call yesterday's news  I don't step on Quinn's toes  she was hugging and kissing Colin yesterday  he's a Hulk  you don't want to hug and kiss  no I don't 
[01:57:30]  yeah I know you don't  I complimented you on your vagina yesterday  I did  I did  show dad your vagina  no don't  no through the pants  just spread your legs and show dad  I mean it's happening  look look see  yeah  nice right  hey  there it is  hey there  hey  someone is licking  nice right  yeah there it is  what are you doing  you got one of those  nice right  I can't think about it  obviously I have one of those  yeah  it works doesn't it  see the camel toe 
[01:58:00]  yeah  lovely  when she gets wet  she's not sure if she's excited  or if it's her diarrhea  oh yeah  I know the difference  believe me  oh she knows the difference  oh yeah  explain the difference  yeah what's the difference  explain the difference  between being excited with moisture  and your diarrhea  yeah  well one is on one side  and the other one is on the other side  yeah but I was thinking  it kind of pours into the same  you know  yeah  area  yeah  it does  by the way Dan  just to get you up to speed  in the 80s  Lady Di used to get it in the shitter 
[01:58:30]  every weekend  from her boyfriend  oh right  really  for the entire decade  I mean that was like  you were ahead of the curve  yeah  anal really didn't get popular  until mid 90s  no chicks are taken in the ass  like that  yeah you're like the Ramones  of butt sex  yeah  you were doing it  in a garage in Queens  before that was on it  if you want to say so  oh no  I don't want to say so  I have to say so  you're right  women didn't  they didn't take in the ass  until they figured out  that hair thing  and they're like  okay now  now I can present this 
[01:59:00]  I didn't want to  I didn't want to  but to keep that boyfriend of mine  well you have to  keep that prize  that's savage head standards  oh yeah  right  and by the way  it only happened on the weekend  she lost her virginity  in an abandoned building  oh Jesus  on top of a door  oh my gosh  yeah I did  I did  that's nice  also about a year ago  she came into the studio  and was so excited  she had a vaginal discharge  yeah  she squirted  you did  you did right 
[01:59:30]  well the reason  the reason that happened  is because  I haven't seen you guys  in 8 years right  uh huh  okay and then all of a sudden  I see you again  it's like  uh oh  I have to run to the bathroom now  you gotta take  you gotta take a pussy shit  I gotta take a nice puss dump  a pussy shit  everybody's talking sexy  that's what you want to call it  I mean  why not  oh man  you know what's so funny  is uh  people like 
[02:00:00]  in porn  the women try to act  like Lady Di  but this Lady Di  is the real world  equivalent of a lady  she's the real world deal  taking it in the ass  it's like if you really  think about what  like a girl  a girl in porn  it's like  I just wanted my shitter  and then Lady Di  is like  I'll do it  it was on the  front bench seat  of an Oldsmobile  and uh  he would lay her down  on his stomach  and just tool her  right in the ass  every weekend  every weekend  I can see  she would pull up  I can see  smell the wet cigarette  butts  that were somewhere  in that Oldsmobile 
[02:00:30]  yes  Winston's  what did you smoke  back then  I didn't smoke  back then  what did he smoke  GPC's  Marlboro cigarettes  did you lose yourself  did you go to your  happy place  and lose yourself  looking through  the rust hole  in the floorboard  just looking at the street  zooming by  well you know  it would be in the  parking lot  so I'm thinking  you know  discarded wax paper  from a deli sandwich  yeah  something like that  just crumpled up  blowing by the  rust hole  I mean 
[02:01:00]  you're the one  dropping the  yeah man  you had the diarrhea  not me  why would you  yeah you wouldn't  want these guys  to gross everybody  out right  right  yeah  because you  wouldn't do  anything like that  so  once you ask  the expert  more questions  alright  more questions  do you think  the airplane  exploded in the air  impossible  no  the flight  direction  well you gotta  understand  the lift  in itself  if the explosion  would have happened  there would have  been a drag  a little bit  of a lag time  and as far as 
[02:01:30]  coming down  so pieces  would have been  spread out  and much more  available  had there been  an explosion  that was a  serious question  because I'm  wondering about  that  do you think  can you repeat  the answer  does she ever  watch the news  she's editorializing  you can't avoid  this storm  I just think of  her trying to  block for  Johnny Unitas  she played  in the NFL  before they  let blacks  play  Emerson  Boozer  by the way 
[02:02:00]  New Orleans  New Orleans  checking in  they think  they can  handle  their weed  no  they can't  handle  you know  I used to  smoke pot  was this  before or  after  loosen up  the old  sphincter  muscles  I don't  remember  that's the  benefit of  the drugs  no no no  I remember  I remember  high school  graduation  yeah  okay  you and  Marion  no no no  it was not  even me and  Marion back then

[02:03:00]  be honest  no  never kissed  your girlfriends  back in  high school  no  no curiosity  nothing like  that  touch a titty  you ever touch  a titty  someone else  girls  not at all  not really  never  never get all  riled up  oh Dan  she's twirling  her hair  every once in a while  Dan's getting a little  excited  every once in a while  what  I think Dan's  questioning his  relationship right now  every morning  I think she's still  asleep  every morning

[02:05:00]  too  yeah I did like  that after the  weather  I showed her  we're in the ocean  the plane might be  how are the tits  oh wow  tits amazing  nice  she showed them to  me before you get  makeup done  cool  wasn't Heather O'Rourke  the kid from  fucking Poltergeist  yeah well uh  come into the  lives here  I think that was  Carol Ann  you know what Bill  told me  no  she's dead  what a Bill  Bill's a sage  isn't he  Bill's my roommate  Bill's an abusive  fuck  but he used to  lick her box a lot  yeah  hey tell Bill  to call his kids  just do that  please 
[02:05:30]  son of an alcoholic  just tell him  to call his kids  call your kids  call your kids  that's what I tell  every alcoholic  just call your kid  just once  Bill used to  lick her pussy  all the time  oh yeah  she would suck  his dick  did you guys  ever just  you guys just  bang out  he couldn't get  a whiskey dick  he had whiskey dick  but back in the day  they used to  you know  fool around  yeah  now they're just  roommates  a couple of times  he used to  lick your pussy  a lot  and now she just  gets here for him  were you there  how do you know  he told us yesterday  you fucking blackout 
[02:06:00]  drunk  how about another  question for the expert  okay  alright  another question  do you think  that there were  any Americans on board  you know  I think they checked  the flight records  but as far as  I don't think  there were  I don't think  there were  that's a serious question  I haven't been asked  that yet  at all the news sources  of all the outlets  you're the only one  that's asked that  so that's a good  question lady  that was a great  question  because that's  something  unlike anything else  they could check  you need an expert  yeah I definitely  in my expertise  I don't think 
[02:06:30]  I would be able  to tell  I couldn't tell  that's true  yeah  another question  any children on board  I don't know  again that's an  expertise question  that only a couple  people would know  people with flight  records  yeah  ticket sales  sure  that's a thing  so yeah  I can't answer that  yeah  any other questions  do you think  there was a bomb  on board  absolutely not  the flight took off  I think the explosion  the black box  would have been saved  and there would have  been some sort of  transmission 
[02:07:00]  did they find  the black box  they have not  found anything yet  yeah they did  they found debris  they found debris  but debris can be  that doesn't  necessarily mean  anything  the black box  is what they  need to find  right  flight records  indicators  right  other words  that are big words  must be amazing  that the news  just misses her  I can't believe this  I can't avoid  knowing certain  things that happen  in the world  I show off  10 channels  and the 11th one  still has  it doesn't matter  like there's  no way to not 
[02:07:30]  know this story  alright  another question  another question  do you think  I can't ask this  you can ask that  come on  come on lady  just ask the question  you just showed  your boobs  first of all  I hope so  okay  do you think  there are any  people alive  and floating  on the seats  alive and floating  on the seats  why are you laughing  that's not a bad question  no no  I know but  it's not a problem  I don't see how that is  a flight  a flight that I dealt with  why'd you ask it 
[02:08:00]  in Lake Superior  they floated for days  yeah  so that could  still  she's not listening  at all  I don't think so  okay  now terrorists  what weapon  do you think  the terrorists use  well again  I don't think  it's been ruled out  that it's a terrorist attack  maybe the  right  maybe  charm  okay  here's a bigger question  the question  come on 
[02:08:30]  lady  don't you get  all schoolgirl  on me  alright  how much money  does  an expert  make  I clear  around  22k  a year  just for  the aviation  union  not bad  then I get paid  every time  I go on  yeah  22 grand  lady  huh  that's after taxes  22 large  that's enough money  to take care of a lady  isn't it  is that it  lady  no  I have another question  on my own  alright go ahead  do you think  one of the pilots  might have had a heart attack  or something  you know what 
[02:09:00]  that's an excellent  excellent question  or you know  something wrong with them  and then all of a sudden  they  they just lost  the airplane was lost  from the radar  yeah  could be  could be  you know  a medical emergency  in the flight deck  and then what  he fell on  the transponder switches  while turning them  while turning them  which could have been a thing  and then the co-pilot  was so overwhelmed  he fainted  and fell on the other one  yeah  right  and broke the communications 
[02:09:30]  the radio  well then the plane  could have gone  what we call George  which is autopilot  right  yeah  so it probably went on George  for a while  George  and then we don't know  where it touched down  and the people in the back  were just hanging out  having some drinks  tiny vodkas  right  right  eating maybe  eating some Malaysian food  lovely  that's a good question too  I just thought about that  that's a great question  such as it might have happened  to the pilot  monkey brains  you know  cover your heart Indy  cover your heart 
[02:10:00]  call him  call him  call him  all right lady  you did great I thought  that was a great  that was the best interview I've had  I'm amazed that you have  no idea what's going on  and tits up front  I didn't even have to wait  through the questions  have a good flight  Dr. Jones  I just imagine  Shorty coming out  with a raft  out of the side of the plane  that's all  it could happen  yeah  it could happen  we should take a break

[02:17:00]  yes a war  it makes for a great book  no matter what you're writing about  war sells  we all know that  my next book is  the war on war  yes  it's all wars  that aren't really happening  yeah  oh yes  I like that  I do like that  wait a minute  that's actually a great idea  I know you shouldn't have blurted it out  she's squeezing your thing  yeah this is my phone case  so when you take a picture  you look like a clown  much like your hair  there you go  it's a phone case  oh well  there it goes

[02:18:00]  I had to say  I'm going to fucking kill you  I'm sure the sponsor loves that  fucking kill her  yeah  Greg Gutfeld  please  before we just ramble about things  and unravel  let's talk about the book  alright  the book is based on  one question  why do people keep doing stupid things  people keep doing stupid things  because they want to be liked  they want to be cool  and so they try to appease people  that really don't like you  well I call them hipsters  but hipsters are basically  a sub-segment  of a larger mindset  that permeates society 
[02:18:30]  which is basically people  who are waging  revolution on all things  right  okay  they're like  they don't like anything  that came before them  but they have nothing  to replace it with  yes  so they don't like  they don't like people  who wear suits  and go to work for a living  but they don't know  what else to do  except write performance art  this is  yeah  that's the problem  with this  I call it the self-published generation  yes  you used to have to go work  look at a shitty newspaper  in Topeka  for fucking 14 years  to get any type of  published article  and work your way out  and now it's like 
[02:19:00]  do you guys want to hear  my critique of the local  Cinnabon  I'm going to pull out  fucking  and it also  and that seeped into  pop culture  like if you look at  like House of Cards  or any of those shows  just sort of watching it  everybody has a job  and the hip job  is at a blog  and they're treated  like they're gods  that's not how it works  no  and those are the people  at the newspaper  we're jealous  of the people  at the blog  what the hell  but it's true  we've figured this out  too with radio 
[02:19:30]  because anybody  that has a podcast  right now  you know what dude  live in Jersey City  it's April 1st  yes  Dan Soder  podcast  you guys are cute  with your one hour  a week  that's adorable  it's three  with Bobby  that's adorable  it's great  when you're listening  to a podcast  and how they convince  themselves  that there are  other people  listening  and they'll actually  ask for callers  and it's the best  we get it with stand up  though  now we get like  there's never been  so many failed actors 
[02:20:00]  trying to do stand up  because that's the thing  they're like  I saw it on TV  I can just do it  that's how you get it too  I mean there's  a bunch of podcasts  that are worth listening to  but there's so many  that aren't  no one has to go  through that thing  you used to have  to go through  like to get a job  at a newspaper  or a shitty little  radio station  yeah making your bones  or anything  now you can just  now you're going to  make me cry  with the internet  you can just  do whatever you want  worked in some  shitholes to get  to this point  and these guys are like  I don't know  I got podcast equipment  I just review  the new video games 
[02:20:30]  and I have 300,000  people download it  I used to do  overnights in Tucson  you cocksucker  Dan's a radio guy too  you have a radio voice  I do  it's very sexy  no podcast is the new  wallet chain  yeah  can we go  okay  I get it  you got a wallet chain  so more in the book  so it's  so you got  here's the problem  with people like  you're describing  right  they don't  they permeate  society now 
[02:21:00]  where one will hear  from the other  and the other  and it becomes real  the word  or the phrase  that I'm so sick  of right now  is white privilege  yes  that seems to have  gotten to the top  of the pile  of shitty things  that's because  you've only dealt  as a man  living your aggro life  first and foremost  I'd appreciate it  if you could just  take your white  fuck  you know  you're right though  just by bringing up  white privilege  you have just 
[02:21:30]  reflected the nature  of white privilege  you can't see it  and the other word  that is great  micro  have you heard of  microaggression  microaggression  it's moving up  the charts  let's say  if they can't  nail you  on being racist  microaggression  is your subconscious  expression of racism  for example  let's say you're  in a college class  and you look  to your friend  on the left  you go  I don't understand  this math problem  she's Asian  that's microaggression  that's the example  they use 
[02:22:00]  because all Asians  are good at math  so you've just  admitted an active  the great thing  about microaggression  and white privilege  is that it allows  the person using that  to infer your intent  without ever  having to prove it  like I know  what you're thinking  and that's  the cool thing  on campus now  is assuming  they know  what you're thinking  and you have  to apologize  people apologize  that's the most  disgusting thing  people say  you know what  I don't know  if I said anything wrong  but I'm sorry  I'm sorry for it  my microaggression 
[02:22:30]  maybe we should  cancel this class  maybe I won't  use the word  bossy anymore  microaggression  or micropenis  because the micropenis  is very embarrassing  it is  microaggression  also very embarrassing  for society  micropenis causes  macroaggression  macroaggression  and you also have  to apologize  for the micropenis  did you hear  about the red marker  now I say this  assuming it has  to be fucking fake  but I think  it was the time  I don't think  it's fake  I think time magazine  tweeted that there's  a school that is  banning the red marker 
[02:23:00]  because it's mean  can you find that  Sam real fast  because it's mean  or  that we did this story  on red eye  it was in England  oh it's in England  in England  but it might be  in America now  because it seems  to start there  it does  and then it comes  over here  but we're adopting  all the policies  of England right now  because red  could hurt your feelings  there it is  it stands red ink  and tells teachers  to mark in green  instead  and get pupils  to respond in purple  yeah  oh my god  isn't that beautiful  the big red F 
[02:23:30]  I can't wait  but then you get  a red A  if you did  yeah  so what's the problem  yeah  Lady Di got a red A  back in the  oh boy  back in the 80's  hold on  hold on  before we continue  could you tell  Greg what happened  in the 80's  he needs to know  okay  back in the 80's  I had a boyfriend  he liked to duanal sex  oh really  yeah  that's a huge surprise  most men hate it  they hate it  no this guy wanted it  really  can you believe it 
[02:24:00]  this guy loved it  every weekend  every weekend  he would pick her up  and you know  pop her and shit her  she's like a sexual  Vietnam vet  she's like  I don't want to go back there  88  I don't want to go back  88  three clicks west  Elizabeth  Mike is back off  so  alright  that was a great story  it was fantastic  oh you want to know  how she lost her virginity  alright  one more  one more  go ahead Lady Di  Lady Di where and how  and how old  have been building  on a door 
[02:24:30]  I'm sorry about that  yeah  I should have  I should have sprung  for a hotel room  yeah  it doesn't really  is that the best answer  yet for losing  a hotel room  yeah  it is a good one  she was 16  he was 26  they're never good  those stories are never  very good  no they're not  wrong  but they're never that bad  well remember Fast Times  at Ridgemont High  that's the best one  where she's looking up  and she's  she's got to be  somebody  she's in the dugout  staring at the graffiti  yeah  the guy is so cool  he's like 40 
[02:25:00]  Ron Johnson  stereo salesman  that's right  got it ruled  that used to work  hey um  yes of course  you know what the new  stereo salesman is  personal trainer  have you been at the gym  the personal trainer  is always with the girls  that is the new  that is the new  stereo salesman  wow really  those are the guys  now that are getting  all the fucking  that's where it is  yeah  they got the bodies  they eat right  yeah  they're in great shape  and they're paid 
[02:25:30]  to show it off  it's not like you  when you have to get  it takes hours  before you get your shirt off  you need an excuse  like I think it's  there's no excuse  yeah  I just wear my shirt  all the time  yeah but no  you will like  stab somebody  so you can do  a tourniquet  with your shirt  there you go  oh we should probably  you look alright  you look okay  oh that's good to know  she's addressing you  right now  that's nice  with her hands  she's throwing it at me  she's very horny  she's horny  but she also has the runs  so  she's horny with the runs  Greg the 
[02:26:00]  that's a great combination  yeah  yeah  I got a  I have Pepsi  all right  Sam maybe we should  get around the studio  for a little bit  oh no  I'll just leave her mic off  she can sit there  I'm loving the five  doing well  loving the five  doing great  yes it really is  a lot of fun  yeah  it's a good thing  I've noticed of late  like most of the other things  you're covering this  the plane  this plane missing  missing plane  are you covering it  differently though sir  I get ornery about it  yes  I mean I get very  I mean the thing is 
[02:26:30]  this is the problem  it could be the biggest story  in the history of the world  if the  you know  it could  it could be anything  or it could be a tragic  plane crash  right  and the thing is  so you can't be  flipping about it  but the coverage  is getting so  ridiculous  ridiculous  and I'm constantly  trying to think  how do you cover it  how do you do it differently  so I basically just sit there  and I try to think of questions  that nobody else is asking  right  but I've run out  which is impossible  because they're covering 
[02:27:00]  every little  it's almost becoming  parody to the point  where you think  it's like with Santa  at Christmas  where they're like  right now he's over Idaho  fuck you  give me some real information  you know the only thing  I don't understand  about this whole thing  is the pilot's family  because the pilot's family  moved out the day  before that plane  really  and that's the  they released that news  a week ago  and then they didn't say anything  so  nothing else  so where is the family  that's what I want  have we not learned anything 
[02:27:30]  from the last 10 years  of movies  that this is going to be  some classified shit  that in 25 years  someone's going to turn  into a movie  and you're going to be like  wow I can't believe  that happened  that happened  I remember watching  the news on that  this is like Argo  it's going to be Argo  in fucking 20 years  you've got to be like Alex Jones  it's a false flag operation  obviously  he must be having  a field day with this  oh he's going crazy  he must be going nuts  right now  he's losing his mind  this is perfect for him  it's in hangar  whatever  yeah yeah  hangar 18 over there  in Groom Lake 
[02:28:00]  over there  by the fucking  there was one of those  flying saucers  over there  there's got to be  somebody's got to be  blaming this on chemtrails  chemtrails  or fracking  I think somehow  fracking is responsible  nothing better  than when the news  runs out of facts  and then they just  start making shit up  CNN was perfect  they have now  discussed black holes  black hole  could be black hole  and they've discussed  we did it as a joke  on our show  for real  but they're discussing  aliens  aliens  I blame the tea party  the word may 
[02:28:30]  is now  becoming is  you used to be able  to say  this is happening  now it's  this may be happening  the other thing is  if you phrase it  as a question  you can report it  has the plane  landed on this island  we'll discuss next  and then you come back  it probably hasn't  it hasn't  well that's the first thing  they teach you  in journalism school  is to not  to attribute the fact  to no one  so you can just say it  so you can be like 
[02:29:00]  it could be  still flying  or some believe  whenever anybody  says some believe  that you are  a racist  you have to ask  right then and there  you gotta go  who are the songs  because it's you  it is you  you're a whip  because you're not saying it  the famous people are saying  people are saying  all that shit  this sounds just like  microaggression to me  microaggression  you need an apology  I've seen on the  on the tag  on the bottom  on the graphic  a lot of times  there's  I've never seen  so many question marks  yeah 
[02:29:30]  like it'll be  a plane  plane in Afghanistan  yeah  and it's like  whoa  and they're hoping  you don't see  the question mark  yeah maybe they're hoping  you don't see it  the question mark is a little  like you know  lighter  the thing that drives me  crazy too  and I've said this before  and it's a nationalistic thing  we  why aren't we taking  charge of this  we're the best at this  and we're being polite  we're going okay Malaysia  we say Malaysia  whenever you need us  we're here  that's like being  that's like  somebody's being mugged  and you're over on the side 
[02:30:00]  going I have a gun  but I'll help you out  I think we're not  taking the lead  because we know  it's just a plane crash  in the end  do you think that's  I guess so  I think they just have  enough intelligence  where like it's  it's a plane crash  and we don't want to get  our resources involved  if it was any other  administration  I might agree  this one's just like  but he did his brackets  that was more important  he did his brackets  did Putin do his brackets  yeah his brackets  were like  East Ukraine  Russia vs Kremlin  we win  we win the game 
[02:30:30]  by the time they invade  by the time they invade Alaska  President Obama  will be having an Easter egg hunt  I fucking love that people  all of a sudden  now are  we've always been aware  that Putin's insane  like when he gave up  the presidency  but then he made  a new job  he's like  I'm no longer president  no you're president  but I'm prime minister  I'm bigger than you  you're a fucking psycho  you can't do that  what  could you talk into a microphone  what are you doing 
[02:31:00]  no it's on  it's on  it's on  okay  yeah  it's possible  beat news  how you doing  is it possible  that the pilot  got lasered  I will never  answer those questions  because I don't know anything  Greg let me step in here  as an aviation expert  let me step in  I think it's safe to say  he didn't get lasered  no I think we have  a hair removal  we have an expert  from the local laser tag  coming in  this is Tom Fickles  from Allentown laser tag 
[02:31:30]  his white would be blinking  if he was shot  by a laser  I do have one more question  I mean you gotta sensationalize  this stuff a little bit  but CNN once again  I'm up their ass today  I guess  but they called it  the zombie plane  are you alright  with graphics like that  zombie plane  what does that mean  I don't know  it's flying on it's own  I would think it would be  like a death plane  or a  yeah everyone's dead  on the plane  but an old school guy  expert they had on  and we said it earlier  he's like  I prefer that you don't  call it a zombie plane 
[02:32:00]  I'll go with ghost plane  but not a zombie plane  I had a friend  die in a flight  1962  I don't call it  a zombie plane  he wouldn't give his knowledge  until they changed it  from zombie plane  to ghost plane  alright now  I'll answer your question  the Payne Stewart plane  yes  that's what  that was creepy  because they  they flew jets  right up to that  and saw everyone  dead inside  with the plane  just tooling along  well here's the question  what if  and I asked this  I don't know  who I asked this to  what if all of a sudden 
[02:32:30]  today  the plane  is in the air  and they say  mayday  we want to land  what does America do  let's say it's coming  to LaGuardia  and they say  we need to land mayday  what does America do  do you shoot it down  do you wonder  if it was held somewhere  and they got away  and it's legitimate  yeah what would you do  I think you have to  I mean  because it could be  full of  it could be  full of gasoline  a bomb  radioactive material 
[02:33:00]  you let it land  in like North Dakota  oh there you go  you find a desolate  I guess you would  you would  you would  you would  what do you call it  you'd go  shadow them  shadow it to a  desolate airport  that's what you would  do  that's a better  to do  see you just came up  with a solution  you're the best expert  thank you  what's going on  that's why I want  all the things  food's coming in  jeez  is that a hot dog  wow  coconut shrimp  you want some  coconut shrimp  oh that's crazy  in the morning  coconut shrimp  I know  it's the alcohol  across the line  that's the weird 
[02:33:30]  no I'm sweating  my mom would make me  have cornflakes  for dinner  I really do  slightly buzzed  just yeah  have some cereal  I remember that  as a kid  you know it's going  to be cereal night  because daddy  and mommy  are falling asleep  I used to get  mine was mini hot dogs  and microwaved  fettuccine alfredo  that sounds good  that actually sounds good  mustard and mayonnaise  mixed for a dipping  sauce  that was the only  rice puffs that we had  all wheat puffs  right  wheat puffs  you always knew  when your friend 
[02:34:00]  had a problem  family  like an alcoholic  parents  because they  if you came over  for dinner  they would like  spaghetti  but with sliced  hot dogs  it was at the last  minute  they put it together  so good  they can eat  some protein  alright  and like  whatever they made  to drink  was this horrible  punch drink  that was used  as a mixer  like here's some  sweats  effervescent  that's used  for gin  my parents  are using it  yeah  you guys  did you just  give me this  because you were  making your own  drink  how about 
[02:34:30]  spaghetti  and ketchup  there it is  there you go  she's coming with  the gold  amazing lady and I  thank you for  contributing  that's close to  tomato sauce  try the coconut  train  she's a sexier  Ed McMahon  she really  not really  I don't want any  you want to know  who she looks like  W.C. Fields  throw mama  from the train  we came up with  Alex Karras  today  Oliver Hardy  you forgot  Oliver Hardy  shut up  and Babe Ruth  all in one  and the Bambino  the great Bambino 
[02:35:00]  the great Bambino  the later years  the later years  legends live forever  when he had to go  to the 316 guy  remember  316  was it 316  sporting events  316  yeah  sure  see it worked  it did  I remember  that's a success  it actually worked  all that time  he spent  ruining his life  you should have  saw me yesterday  really  why  the face pain  the face pain 
[02:35:30]  you're a child  at heart  aren't you  he doesn't care  he really is  yeah  that's good  I'll show you that  if child means enlarged  you can say that  we gave her a makeover  medical problem  yeah  we'll makeover  teetering on  we gave her  we made her look like  the puppet  thing from Saw  we painted her face up  I saw that tweet  you did the little thing  on the  yeah the white paint  and everything  right  I don't know  that's what I saw  it was very frightening  it scared me  it did right  I was frightened 
[02:36:00]  it scared me too  by the way  do you know  I think the last time  I was here  this cut was kind of  momentous  the Anthony Weiner  crotch shot  happened here  with Breitbart  I think the last time  you were here that day  wow  yes  no wait  I wasn't here  I was here  I wasn't here  I think you were there  shortly after  I actually thought  I was here  no we had  who was here  Private Kyle was here  Breitbart was with me  the night before  we were at a bar  and Anthony saw it  the night before  I was hanging out  you were on Red Eye  right  oh man yeah 
[02:36:30]  so we were together  we did some of that  drinking that night  and that's when you said  Breitbart come on the show  come on the show  and then here he was  next to that guy  from Law and Order  yes  oh you hated him too  Private Kyle  Private Kyle  and then he took the picture  from behind  no no no  he just passed the picture  out  he wanted that picture  out  oh yeah  I've said it a million times  that was probably  your most historic show  that was huge  that was huge  he didn't know  how to get the picture out  yeah  and he knew  that if he was just  careless with it  somebody would go  he was showing everybody 
[02:37:00]  so me and Ange  just took a picture  of his phone  as fast as we could  that was it  because no one  that was the only way  to get it out there  without  like you did it  accidentally  you left it out there  oops  oops  and then Barbara Walters  had a talk about us  and she was so pissed  remember  what she was saying  oh I saw that picture  days ago  and was so mad  yeah  and she didn't get  the exclusive  that's hilarious  it was acting like  it was no big deal  The View  The View  two days ago  so they have the Duke  the Duke porn star on  and the audience 
[02:37:30]  applauds wildly  and I'm thinking  I'm thinking  okay  if that was your daughter  she does  a violent style  of pornography  where she's choked  while she's having sex  they don't know that  they just see the girl  they all the people  in the audience  see is a girl  with hot pants  yeah  nobody goes  we're going to show you  a graphic scene  where she's almost  choked out  right right  this isn't Marilyn Chambers  she's not like  classy pornography  this is like  she should get the shit  kicked out of her  for 15 minutes  and Whippy's like  I think there's a really  good message here 
[02:38:00]  or something  about empowerment  what good empowerment  my ass  if she was here  she was here  at the beginning  of the week  kind of mousy  we got a lot  very mousy  we got a lot of shit  for our interview  I thought we did  alright though  I thought we didn't  beat her up enough  it's like  what are you supposed  to do  I mean I get  she was on the  independents  they were saying  she's like  a libertarian hero  because she's making  her own choices  I understand that  but you know  10 years from now  she's going to be  nowhere  she's going to be  nowhere  she's not hot enough  to have a long  career in porn  but she found her  angle  I don't believe  for a second  that she was paying 
[02:38:30]  for her tuition  I mean that she  did this just to pay  she was going to  go into porn  no matter what  and said  wait a minute  if I connect the two  that's going to be  a headline  which is smart  on her part  she's a businesswoman  at heart  but in this day and age  you can't just be  a new porn star  there's a million of them  no one gives a fuck  but if you have an angle  they care  and she's not hot enough  for that to continue  who's this giant  that just walked by  I just got distracted  he took up the whole  glass wall 
[02:39:00]  go check that out  do you have an  in search of radio show  because I think  that was Sasquatch  Sasquatch  he's going to  pin you on the plane  send me down the hall  to the in search of channel  they haven't found me either  you're listening to  70s on 7  that says Bigfoot  but we  I don't know  she turned out  to be pretty cool  the interview was just  us having fun with her  and I was like  alright we'll just  have fun with this  it's hard to beat up  on a girl  that like  she's got these weird  idealistic 18 year old  thoughts 
[02:39:30]  and you know  in two years  she's going to be like  oh god  did I say that  so what are you  going to do  crucify her  at this point  you know  the people  understand  her dad  is in Afghanistan  her dad is in Afghanistan  has no idea  this was a doctor  in Afghanistan  and he's like  he comes home  he comes home  I think any father  if their daughter  came to them  and said  I am going to do porn  because I need to  make my tuition money  that father's going to  figure something out  he'll figure something out 
[02:40:00]  with a friggin mask  over his face  holding a gun  at the teller  anything  you know the tweets  are going to be today  stop making excuses  guys  but that's  that's how bloodthirsty  I'm just being honest about it  if we blew it  we blew it  but in the end  I thought we just  had a good time  but how bloodthirsty  are we as a culture  that they're like  you guys weren't mean enough  this chick gets choked  for her job  her job is to take a dick  while getting beat up  and people are like  your questions weren't tough enough  exactly  she stops breathing 
[02:40:30]  until they say cut  they do multiple takes  of her with a dick  clogging her airways  that's what I'm saying  and you're like  nah  you guys weren't mean  on the radio show  you fucking zoo animals  the scary thing is  that is where she's  starting her porn career  that's where she's starting  where is she going to end up  she's not on  she's not on  dryhump.com  remember that horrible guy  she went right to god mode  like would open up  women's eyes  with like things  yeah he got arrested  yeah he's in jail  I can't remember his name 
[02:41:00]  I don't know why  Jimmy talks about him  all the time  Max Hardcore  yeah exactly  yeah Max Hardcore  is the guy that  would do those horrible  like facial things  he would combine like surgery  yeah it was terrible  with all kind of apparatus  yes  yeah that was my line  I couldn't watch that  I don't like any of that stuff  no I'm serious  that's my line  that's my line  my line is that guy  on the horse  up in the pacific northwest  that made that noise  right when you heard him  pop inside  my line is the sex  the sex scenes on Scandal  when it gets a little too 
[02:41:30]  quiet a little too hot  I just back off  a little too racy  when she's making love  to the president  it disgusts me  I don't like a well  stricken light scene  exactly  no one  see Joshua Molina  in bed in a t-shirt  it's just a little  too much for me  it's my line  can we take a phone call  we got a big fan  of yours Greg  Greg Gutfeld in studio  his new book is called  Not Cool  The Hipster Elite  and Their War on You  and we got Devin  in Wisconsin  Devin  hey Greg  how you doing  I'm good thanks  hey I just wanted  to say thank you 
[02:42:00]  for the rant  that you did  on electronic cigarettes  and the way that  the media  is portraying them  I'm a 20 year  former smoker  a good friend of mine  opened up one of these  shops out here  in Wisconsin  Wisconsin  we have helped  well over 5 to 6,000  people quit smoking  and they're just  going to keep on  kicking it to death  because of the  revenue loss  this is a good point  though because  I haven't had a cigarette  in four months  because of e-cigarettes 
[02:42:30]  which is nothing  but a nicotine  delivery system  like chewing gum  or the patch  but somehow  because it resembles  a cigarette  people are offended  by it  they're saying  that it could create  mass confusion  which is why  they're banning it  indoors in New York  the crazy  okay so  my comparison is  well then ban  cross-dressing  how many times  has Jim Norton  been like obsessed  confused  confused  when he takes  home the wrong girl  but you would never  do that in New York City  you would never  tell people how to dress  but because  the cigarette  looks like something else 
[02:43:00]  it looks like a cigarette  but you can't  make laws  because it looks  like something  exactly  and they should also  try the hash pen  because it's way  better  and obviously  the electronic hash pen  is where it's at  I mean that's  going to be the next thing  Greg what about  and I don't know  the chemicals  are they worried  about the chemicals  in those e-cigarettes  the Beijing water vapor  it can't be any worse  than an actual cigarette  no it's about  the amount of chemicals  in there  are practically nil  compared to an actual cigarette  it's water vapor  there's stuff that's in there  is in every 
[02:43:30]  and so many other  products that we use  they haven't done  complete testing of it  but when you compare it  to a cigarette  it's nothing  and the idea of  second hand vapor  is a lot  it's crazy  it's crazy  trying to go down  that road  yeah  what flavor do you  I smoke  I smoke just  plain old classic tobacco  I do the  what's the one I do  I do the blue  oh Stephen Dorff  yeah  because you know  he convinced me  I was like  you know  whatever Dorff does  I will do  I always like  when he flips up 
[02:44:00]  his collar  all pretentious  and he's like  take your life back  yeah  go fuck yourself  Stephen Dorff  I'm smoking hash  motherfucker  I'm getting high as balls  do you feel healthier  since  yeah I mean  I'm not coughing  as much  and  the only problem  with it  is you smoke more  because the cigarette  never goes out  so I'll say you're up  all night  going what happened  because you took in  so much nicotine  that's true  because you don't know  when you're done  so why don't they  that's one cigarette's worth  but wouldn't that be 
[02:44:30]  a great thing to figure out  where they kind of  go out somehow  and you gotta  yeah  they sure you set it  they have a thing  where like  if you smoke too much  it blinks five times  that's what the hash pen does  and that's when you know  you're ready  Jesus  you just pull  and then you just  launch that blinking  but it means to me  you and I used to  smoke cigarettes together  yeah  how much do you miss  the real thing though  I quit smoking in June  and it's like  I quit drinking  and I quit smoking  wow  smoking cigarettes  I miss every fucking day  when I smell a real cigarette  but I gotta tell you  it's been 
[02:45:00]  it's  this is the easiest  quitting ever  and I have not  the great thing is  I haven't bought a pack  that's the best feeling  those are like 14 bucks  yeah  I miss  I miss the nice  pack in a real pack  the ritual  there's a ritual  to the whole smoking thing  yeah  and just  that click of the lighter  on the first one  you're like  I'm back baby  I do fucking miss it  you know what feels great  walking outside  and seeing the person  in freezing weather  smoking  and you're not  and you're not that person  you're just out there  and you're going like  I was that guy  and then you watch 
[02:45:30]  an episode of True Detective  and you're like  I do want a cigarette  you know it really is cool  I could go for a tall boy  of Lone Star  and a fucking camel light  right about now  but Hollywood will never  go after that show  about smoking  no  that's great  yeah  there are certain shows  and movies  they'll go after  and ones they'll just  completely leave alone  but it's art  it's art  it's cool  it's like oh that's art  that person would smoke  that's uh  it's like who are you  to dictate who would  and wouldn't smoke  and who's impressionable 
[02:46:00]  to kids  and who aren't  they're going to cut it out  of old movies  but I'm almost convinced  at this point  with all the fucking hormones  in our food  and everything  that's ever around  shouldn't we just smoke cigarettes  maybe it's good  and it's like the microaggression  like can't we just come  all the way around  is that what's going to happen  in 50 years  that people are blatantly racist  and that's the new  political correctness  I think we've hit a point  where now it's like  it might be healthy  for people to vent  and just say  and have like an  have an intolerance free day 
[02:46:30]  like one day  oh man  it's like  what was that movie  like The Purge  yes The Purge  yeah racism  say whatever you want  say any word you want  any of these banned words  you can just go out  and say it  it's called rural Alabama  you can still do that  it's called my living room  it's called  it's called  Kumi's Twitter feed  it's called  my Escalade  on the drive home  do you think  there will ever be  a pushback  to all this stuff  it's obviously  the older people  like ourselves  that are like  this is nonsense  it seems like  the younger generation  is all in with this shit  I think on campus 
[02:47:00]  they're getting tired  of being told  I think there is  a pushback  the bossy thing  flopped  it bombed  that was great  and I think a few  a few years back  that would have had  more legs than it did  now but I think  people are starting  to get like  shut down everybody else  in their words  for a little while  yeah yeah  but for one thing  they didn't say  the word bitch  which is in all  in every hip hop song  that's what we said  Beyonce was pushing  that whole bossy thing  yeah but she goes  after bossy  and what about her husband  and you know  the n word  no one calls anyone bossy 
[02:47:30]  I never heard anyone  call bossy anyone  it was a safe  it was a safe cause  you're talking to a publicist  right  and a publicist says  you can do something  for like disabled kids  it's like  well I don't  I don't know  I'm busy  no those little weirdos  are creepy  but what about bossy  oh yeah bossy  that's good  that won't hurt my career  at all  I could just hashtag it  and I'm done  oh that's brilliant  you're absolutely right  and that flopped  we should take a quick break  and then we'll  we'll do another half hour  you're sticking around right 
[02:48:00]  yeah yeah I'm good  we're not breaking  if you're not sticking around  no I'm here  alright good  so the new book by Gutfeld  is Not Cool  The Hipster Elite  and Their War on You  also we got Dan Soder here  who's playing the punchline  next weekend  Wednesday through Saturday  Dan  yeah  and Dan Soder  on the Twitter  at Dan Soder  and also  we got a paid lady to die soon  she's been our intern  she's great  I think that was  an excellent treasure  she asked great questions  she does  you know what she is  she adds a whole new element  to the show  that was missing  which was death  I've never seen a pair 
[02:48:30]  of National Geographic tits  in person  on white  on white  oh look at the veins  oh you're terrible  we'll be back  with more opium  thank you  having a real good time  with Greg Gutfeld  new book  Not Cool  The Hipster Elite  and Their War on You  it is a war on us  I think this one's going to do well  I'm tired of the war  I'm war ravaged  it's a war on affordable rent 
[02:49:00]  I'm angry  yes  how do you fight back  with this Greg  I mean  we can't all write a book  that's true  you don't read their blogs  you don't fucking listen  to their  Buzzfeed  39 reasons  the worst thing you can do  is  do not take them seriously  or the best thing you can do  do not take them seriously  laugh at them  but we don't  but then there's other people  that do  I've been up until  the wee hours of the morning  fighting the Twitter battle  with a lot of people  with these similar ideas  and stuff  and it's amazing 
[02:49:30]  how uneducated they are  on a lot of topics  they're lazy  yes  they're very lazy  they're hashtag activists  yeah  and then they have this  hash-to-vix  hash-to-vix  that sounds like the new  like the group  that's rising up  in the Ukraine right now  hash-to-vix  the hash-to-vix  yes  we will get them  Britain wants us  to be hash-to-vix  they sound scary  it's just  it's so frustrating  to try to argue  with these people too  because they 
[02:50:00]  they are never wrong  yeah  they can never change  their opinions  based on it  you know what they  what they  what they're trying to do  which is failing  is they're trying to  they're trying to  apply meaning to facts  so if you give them a fact  that's just mean  and incestive  yes  that's like  but it's actually a fact  they don't like facts  yeah  they hate facts  they love pure emotion  and vagaries  yeah  well that's why kids now  are told to follow  their dreams  and they're special  that's why  like people wonder 
[02:50:30]  why all the factory jobs  are going to China  and shit  that's because  everyone grows up  thinking they're going  to be on American Idol  and not that they should  fucking learn how  to weld a door  this is an excellent point  yes  the essence of cool  is popularity  without achievement  yeah  there are  we keep saying  there are no jobs  there are jobs  there are millions  of jobs  and welding  and heavy machinery  Mike Rowe talks about  this all the time  he's a badass  and he talks about this  he goes  there's got to be  vocational schools  and trade schools  to get these kids  out of college 
[02:51:00]  and learn something  real  you can make good money  you can make great money  doing this stuff  and you can buy a house  with cash  but instead  everybody thinks  that they can be  I don't know  they could be  again like you said  an American Idol phenomenon  right  people don't even want  to learn an instrument  no no  they don't want  to learn  they don't even want  to go that step  no achievement  whatsoever  yeah  they want the popularity  without the achievement  without any work to it  the new factory line job  at America  is criticizing  they're like 
[02:51:30]  it's a great export  I'm going to start at 18  and I'm going to really start  tearing things apart  but it's fucking ridiculous  you know  I uh  I feel like the HBO show  Girls has created  a whole new army  of women  who are going  I'm just going to write  a sitcom about myself  about me  it's not interesting  Sarah and Jessica Parker  and Sex and the City  I think was like  the genesis of that  I'm going to write  a blog about dating  you're like  you're just going to  get fucked  and then jot notes down  but that was a terrific show  though 
[02:52:00]  that was a good one  oh incredibly well written  it was  I cried at least  once a week  I mean that was a  I'm not going to lie  that's an upper tier TV show  we had a program director  that told us to watch  Sex and the City  to get the vibe  of New York  I was in Boston  for three years  I don't think I lost  the vibe of New York  there were so many  bad messages  in that show  yes  we all  yes  my favorite though  is I always appreciate  Joe DeRosa  he will always defend 
[02:52:30]  his love of Sex and the City  but you  she was a terrible writer  that was the whole thing  she would do  her arena right  they would go  oh that was so good  it's like no  it's the worst  it's a show about  a terrible writer  I wouldn't read her  if she was a real person  exactly  that's what it is though  I feel like  this is what we get  for not calling our kids stupid  yeah exactly  like I'm in comedy  because I was so  verbally abused  that I had to 
[02:53:00]  develop a sense of humor  to deal with it  this is  the more you coddle  the more you create  a loser  yeah  really  that's the way  and we become  I talk about it  in the book  we are so consumed  by the idea of bullying  and the one thing  that drives me nuts  is everybody claims  they were bullied  but they never say  they were the bully  so where are all the bullies  where did all the bullies come  I was a bully  I was bullied  and I was a bully  I will admit it  yeah yeah  yes  and the campaigns  don't work  because there's more  bullying going on now  than ever before  because it's easier 
[02:53:30]  with twitter and everything  yeah the celebrities  that are doing these  anti-bullying campaigns  you know they're assholes  right  they bully their publicists  of course  one of my favorite lines  get me on that bully campaign  you used to have to walk up  to someone and bully them  and that was a risk  every single time you did it  or if it was being done to you  you had to fight  that feeling in your gut  knowing it was wrong  and you're like  I'm still going to slap  this dumb ass  in the back of your head  right  he deserves this  this goofy looking fuck  and now you can just be  an egg on twitter  that's why 
[02:54:00]  but Greg brought up  a great point  everyone was the bully  and the bullied  except for  the ultimate alpha bully  on the top  and the ultimate nerdy dick  that always just got bullied  on the bottom  that gets rid of two people  it trickled down  it was a spectrum  it was the Reaganomics of bullying  yeah  trickled down bullying  and not only that  but you kind of understood  that the guy at the top  that won  well his life was done at 17  he was going to go work  at a shitty job  and you knew the guy  at the bottom  his life was really going to  start around 27  when he got a graduate degree 
[02:54:30]  and shit  my favorite line  in stand-up right now  Burr has a line  in his act  where he says  this is what happens  when he's talking  about bullying  and he goes  there's too many nerds  this is what happens  when you eliminate  a species natural predator  and it fucking makes me laugh  it's one of those  accurate descriptions  the most popular kids  in high school  had a quick shelf life  their lives were  you were right  they barely even  went to college  you can't  you peak  if you peak too early  it's over  they were rock stars in high school  you got to peak in high school 
[02:55:00]  we all wanted to be them  but then you go back  to homecoming  and they're hanging out  in the local bar  they've still got  their varsity jacket  and I'm like  what's happening to you  they run their dad's  trophy shop  that's what it is  but they were rock stars  in high school  you're like  oh my god  you ran for 200 yards  on homecoming week  by the way  the air in the left tires  if you could pump that one  why is that  but everyone knew that  because that used to  just be an unspoken thing  that you're like  oh you know the guy  with the muscles at 15 
[02:55:30]  he's gonna suck at 26  but nobody tells you that  no but no  that's the  okay this is where  I become a right wing moralist  if you have  let's get militia greg in here  if you have an intact family  someone in your family  takes you aside  and says  you know what  that guy that's bugging you  he's gonna be a loser  in three years  quietly laugh at him  and if you have to  pop him in the face  but because you got broken homes  nobody's passing that information  no I can also say  though coming from a broken home  when you have a broken home  and that shit happens  basically what happens 
[02:56:00]  your whole life  you're like  I'm gonna get good at something  and prove to these motherfuckers  that they were wrong  and then you  you know  then in your 20s  you look around for that gratification  and it doesn't happen  god damn it  what game works  it's my 30s  yeah  even in the 30s  you want to brag to someone  and they're like  alright why don't you be professional  oh wow  it is  what other things in the book  that you cover there  I want to make sure  we do this proper for you  yeah  I talk about how  basically the 
[02:56:30]  the cool  romanticize  evil  for example  I talk about the  Rolling Stone cover  where they put the bomber  on the cover  and how he looks like  basically a long lost  Jonas brother  yes  that to me is a metaphor  for how the entertainment  is always in love  with the dark  and the evil  like  I have this part  where I talk about  how nobody knows  the name of Eugene Moore  or Howard Hall  but they know  Bonnie and Clyde  those are the people  that he killed  you never know the victims  you never know the victims  you only know the bad guys  and that's part of 
[02:57:00]  the overall hipster mentality  that it's so cool  to subvert the normal  to go after tradition  even though you have  nothing to replace it  so even killing people  is kind of cool  right right  as long as you know  there's no one to replace them  with  yeah exactly  one of your points  oh you had some  no I was just  I was agreeing  with that whole  thing that there's  it's great to criticize  look at the cop killer  you google  Daniel Faulkner  in Philadelphia  you'll get maybe  10,000 hits  you google  Mumia Al-Jamal 
[02:57:30]  you'll get  2 million  because he's got  so many celebrities  that are backing him  and Depp Rowe  because you know  he's a radical  with dreads  right right  we got a guy  that's going to  back up on your points  Max in Maine  go ahead  we got Greg Gutfeld  in the studio  is there a delay  in the phone  Max  bello  ah sorry  it says hipsters  don't want jobs  like you're saying  my industry  construction  has tons of jobs  they just won't take  you still  you're not there Max  yeah yeah  construction  alright go Max 
[02:58:00]  come on  hey  yeah I work  in the logging industry  running heavy  heavy equipment  it's pretty easy  for somebody my age  I'm right out of  high school  college age  I'm 25  it's really easy  to find a job  as long as you're  willing to work  with manual labor  and the pay is good  see that's exactly right  he's in  and who  I mean  by the way  being a logger  is cool  I mean I wouldn't even  I can't even  change attire 
[02:58:30]  I could legitimately  wear this  shirt  you're ready to go  all the hipsters  in Williamsburg  appropriate  the logger look  the look is there  they all have  logger beards  while they wait  your tables  you're supposed  to build a table  and I just want  I just want to let you know  that no trees  were harmed  and you're supposed  to be a tree  mass murderer  not a fucking  libertarian  you know what  I have this theory 
[02:59:00]  that like  people want jobs  they can do  drunk  you can't do  you can't be a logger  drunk  no  you can't operate  heavy machines  yeah they want  a job  like a writer  yeah it's like  if I won the lottery  I would be a writer  and it's like  well you can't write  well you know  it's just like  something I like to do  it's like nobody says  I want to build something  I want to build something  and I can't build anything  this country  was based pretty much  on people that built things  yeah  for free  it's called slavery  it's a pretty dark period  but now 
[02:59:30]  it's like  no one wants to  make things anymore  yeah  and it's showing  definitely  what  oh we can make  we can make opinions  yes we can make opinions  yes  we are the conveyor belt  of opinions  do you want to know  what I think about  usual suspects  that's our new export  is my opinion  on my  excuse me Greg  yes how are you  all right  you invented  the electric cigarette  right  yes I invented it  how in the world  well you know  maybe I shouldn't say  I don't know 
[03:00:00]  how did you make  one of those  I have a lab  I have a lab  an underground lab  where I take old  used cigarettes  and I shove batteries  in them  and then I light them  it's amazing  how well they work  actually they were  invented in China  over 10 years ago  really  all the technologies  from China  comes over  from China now  I remember  years back  when I was a little girl  okay they used to  they used to have  the cigarettes  bubblegum cigarettes  I don't know if you  remember that  right  and of course 
[03:00:30]  those are evil  because that's a gateway  drug  I remember having those  do you remember  bubblegum cigarettes  yeah  big league  bubblegum cigarettes  it was like tobacco  but it was shredded gum  and you take it out  they still have it  do they  did you ever get  Pez heroin  it was like real  heroin  but it's Pez  you just inject it  into your arm  with a candy  against the wall  just have a nice  sugar nod  a sugar nod  I got very good news

[03:04:00]  I think we might have needed you  we don't need you now  excuse me  but I was  alright hold on  hold on  this guy's a huge fan of yours  from Mississippi  Brad go ahead  we have to listen to this  come just  hey Brian  how are you  Mississippi  Mississippi River  here we come  that accent can't be real  but it is  here we come  go dump your ass in the river  that's a good comeback  say Mississippi  Mississippi though  river  go dump your ass in a river  you would think river  first 
[03:04:30]  it's like the McLaughlin group  with alcoholism  yeah this is  what's your take on the  Beijing economy  bye guys  bye  bye bye  bye bye  excuse me Greg  what's this  bling ball thing  that  ball bling  or whatever that is  it's a chapter about  how it's no longer  just enough  to be a good athlete  you also have to  cultivate a lifestyle  because that's because  pop culture  has infiltrated  and the idea of celebrity  has infiltrated  the idea of being a sportsman 
[03:05:00]  so now you've got to  it's not good enough  to just be a good sportsman  I blame Cribs  do you remember Cribs  absolutely  great show  Cribs  loved it  every major house  looked the same  because nobody knew  how to like  fill up a house  so they go  we'll just get some  weird glass sculpture  large paintings  and then there'll be  a game room  yes the game room  pool table  so the athlete  will walk through  and it's like  he's been in the house  for the first time  he goes  oh yeah  that's where I put my suits 
[03:05:30]  and there's a big thing  of suits  there's just one of his  jerseys framed  that's where I put it  in the pro bowl  this is where I kick back  do you guys want to see  points at a wall  do you guys want to see  the cars  there's nobody around  there's nobody in the house  no one's in the house  and they've all been  foreclosed  is Mary still there?  they've been foreclosed  all those houses  that you saw in Chris  five years ago  are gone  you know they are  they had some sweet rides  though  a whole spotless garage 
[03:06:00]  but none of the athletes  could explain  what they purchased  because they were purchased  by their manager  and it's gone  you need this  so yeah  I just opened up  a whole line of car washes  they also opened up  car washes  because somebody told them  that car washes  was the way you make money  that's how you  continue making money  after your career  and I got that  Scarface DVD right here  or the poster  the poster  or the  who did love  Pacino's early work 
[03:06:30]  the VHS tape  are you telling me  you actually saw that movie  I've never heard of that movie  what is it?  you live your life  by that movie  that movie inspired you  to live your life  you know how it ended  right?  in a  in a gaudy pool of blood  yes exactly  that's what you're  looking forward to  these kids  they used to like  real movies  deliverance  you know what's  going to be fun  like I said  it goes full circle  and the new hipster thing  is like whittling  and like making shit  with your hands  whittling  but you can't 
[03:07:00]  be arrested  for carrying that knife  yeah that's true  no pictures  in this book  he likes a good book  with pictures  sure why not  you know what you should do  is when you read your book  imagine pictures  imagine the pictures  in your head  oh I could take this home  what?  it's yours  not that you touched it  it's yours  it'll make a good  coaster for you  I can't picture  reading it  you can explain it  to the authorities  when they pick you up  sure  maybe you can use it  to hit Bill with  when they keep asking 
[03:07:30]  you to move  could you please move  that's an idea right there  hit Bill with it  by the way  we gotta give away  some wrestling tickets  what?  oh great  yeah  for the latest  happenings in WWE  or to see when  WWE will be in your  area  visit  WWE.com  forward slash  events  for tour dates  and we got a pair  of tickets to the  Brooklyn thing  DC  oh DC  DC  call if you're in the  DC area  yeah call  oh there it is  alright  WWE Raw  in Washington DC  at the Verizon Center  March 31st  if you could go

[03:10:00]  a guy with a uniform  let's put it that way  and how did you do  does it become space  it's 98,000 feet  that's nice  I've always wondered that  and when does it become  completely dark  like is it all blue  and then you cross into dark  99,000  is that 99  do you ever walk and wonder  when the rain starts  yeah yeah  it's got to start somewhere  they sound like song lyrics  yeah they are  do you ever walk and wonder  when the rain starts  it's really good

[03:12:00]  it really is  we're having a moment  where does the rain start  we were having a moment  when does the rain start  you'll do that song  you'll be the artist  it's alright I guess  it's a Neil Sadaka  old school  I would think maybe  James Taylor could do it  easy  I'll tell you later  it sounds like a Jimmy Buffet  Jimmy Buffet  would be a fun  that's a fun version  yeah it's like after  like the fucking  hey where does the rain start  like a little more off tempo  yeah  the rain is a metaphor  I was in my room  the rain is a metaphor

[03:16:00]  now  and look back  on another legendary day  broadcasting  this is the Opie and Anthony  Post Show  with Sam Roberts  welcome  it's the Post Show  866-WOW-1-WOW  Dan Soder is here  hey buddy  Lady Di is here  hey buddy 
[03:16:30]  you can do it  into the mic too  see Dan did it  into the mic  hey buddy  hey buddy  oh is everybody  feeling good  Di  still working  on the headphones  you're a WWE Network  superstar  I can't believe  I'm in the same room  as you  show me the picture  I'm fucking  we gotta talk  have you watched  all of it  I watch the WWE Network  constantly  can I tell you  a new character  that Big Jay O'Kerson  and I developed  please do  I'll just call  Di just said no  so there we go  alright we're gonna 
[03:17:00]  move on to the next  what's going on  I'm a big WWE fan  you don't even know  we already went over this  you don't know  tell me  tell me about the character  Big Jay and I  when we get high  we do  Macho Man  subtly getting racist  Macho Man  describing the  deterioration  of his neighborhood  you get high  yeah  where he's like  yeah  first they start  moving in  yeah  then the rent price  is going on  next thing you know  crime is up  yeah  schools aren't as good  you're like  what 
[03:17:30]  what are you talking  about Macho Man  no I'm not a racist  no I'm not  I'm the most liberal  person you're ever  gonna meet  but I know  statistics speak  for themselves  all I know  is small crimes  yeah  down to the bottom  up to the top  yeah  corruption in the city  dig it  yeah  and you can kind of  see Macho Man  in his crazier moments  having those conversations  absolutely  you're trying to tell me  that Asians  moving into the neighborhood  yeah  you fix it  changes the way  to school districts  are zoned  yeah  I like the older wrestlers 
[03:18:00]  like Hulk Hogan  and stuff  I don't mean  the older ones  I mean  you know  not like Macho Man  more like Hulk Hogan  yeah  you know  an alive old one  not a dead old one  right right right  right exactly  hey Sal  do we have a line of the day  although for me  line of the day  is racist  macho man  but Sal  you pick line of the day  here  comes  line of the day  line of the day  line of the day  we stayed friends with them 
[03:18:30]  you don't remember him  do you  yeah yeah  for how long now  oh yeah  I feel like we're in line of the day  I fucking agree with that line of the day  it was good  Greg Gutfeld  uh huh  see Di's a little out of  out of sorts  because  the first three days of this week  Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday  Di scored a line of the day  oh  so she's mad that she didn't  so she was kind of hoping  to close the week strong  is that right 
[03:19:00]  three out of five is good  but you know what  it's hard  because it's top heavy  it's the first three  so it's like  you get that glory  all at once  but that's it  you don't realize that's it  well you stop fighting for it  that's exactly right  if I have the line of the day  that's fine  but if I don't have the line of the day  that's okay  that's right too  that's a good philosophy  to just have  this is why  I ensure that there's going to be  more lines of the day  coming from Lady Di  you're exactly right  oh boy  because of that attitude  that can-do attitude  that's it  uh  Ron in Wisconsin 
[03:19:30]  hey Sam  I was watching the WWE Network  the other day  uh huh  and they showed a clip  from a beach bash  where Ron Bennington  and Sam Watley  were fighting  Dan have you seen that?  what bash of the beach  which one?  I think it might be 96 even  okay  because I just watched 95  like I just was telling  Iraq about it  I just watched 95  if you watch  Bash at the Beach 96  yeah  like halfway through  the pay-per-view  Tony Schiavone  starts talking about  these radio guys  that they had 
[03:20:00]  uh  wrestle a match  before the pay-per-view  started  from the Ron and Ron  network  and you see  they go to a clip of it  because they pre-taped it  before the show started  and it's Fez  and he's in a tag team match  and Ron Bennington  is his manager  and he's hitting him  with a cane  it's amazing  I mean I gotta  I'm gonna watch this today  it's amazing  it's 96  Bash at the Beach  I believe it's 96  Bash at the Beach  which is the  which is the big NWO  wait was it?  no it's 97  no it's 96 
[03:20:30]  I think  96  yeah Bash at the Beach  was it really them  or was it a cartoon  because uh  you know  no you're right  you're right  you're good to call me on that  Dan I misled you  it was a cartoon  everyone knows  the 96 Bash at the Beach  was animated  yeah  yeah  it was a cartoon  you're right  no I don't know  because  I used to  back in 1998  I used to have  a computer  and sometimes  you see these cartoons  and everything like that  you know people  put them up as cartoons  sometimes  no you're right 
[03:21:00]  I like that you just  explained computers  like they didn't catch on  yeah you're right  you bring that up  it was like  if computers never  got  became wildly popular  and some of the  computers had cartoons  on them  and in 98 or so  oh this is it  you guys found it  1994  94  is a year too late  see that's Fez  oh  that's Fez  alright  that's Fez  you can find it  Bash at the Beach  94 is the year  yeah  that's hilarious  you had a girl  wrestle him  um  and there's Ron  the manager  and he does the 
[03:21:30]  bad guy manager  perfectly  uh  Matt  in DC  what's up buddy  hey  I'm a huge wrestling fan  too  and I'm just curious  what do you watch  the most on the WWE  network  because there's so much  to choose from  you know what I watch  the most  I watch the episode  of Countdown  that I was on  of course you do  I just keep rerunning  oh there it is again  there  oh look who's talking  about the barbershop  and Bruce Beacare  you're more of a  narcissist than Lex Luger  oh  who's been watching it  that's why you're a comedian  save that for the stage 
[03:22:00]  I've been watching  the WWE replays  of Monday Night Raw  oh  from like 93  dude they're fucking awesome  I watched the ramp up  to the King of the Ring  every night  after my shows in Denver  when I would come home  at like 2 in the morning  it would be perfect  they would show the whole Raw  so  I would watch  I watched the whole lead up  to the first King of the Ring  and then you could find  the King of the Ring  and then I watched  King of the Ring  and it's so disappointing  the only good match  is Mr. Perfect Bret Hart  that's the only good  that's it  what were you just going to say  you're a comedian  are you a comedian too 
[03:22:30]  yeah yeah  I'm a comic  oh  I didn't know that  yeah yeah  I mean you know  you're up there  watching planes so long  you just start writing jokes  right okay  well it's a funny job  being a plane expert  I don't know  an aviation expert  you could be an aviation expert  and be a part-time comedian  you know what  we didn't mention on the air  I'm a full-time comedian  part-time aviation expert  of course Lady Dive  found out that Dan Soder  was an aviation expert today  and was asking him questions  about the Malaysian air flight  that was lost  a lot of questions  before she came on the air  Lady Dive informed us  that she was under the impression 
[03:23:00]  that an aviation expert  studies ships  in the ocean  I was  I got him confused  aviation is the gift of flight  right  I know what  navigation is  that the Wright brothers  right  navigation expert  is strictly boats  yeah I understand  I got him confused  oh my god  sure sure  I got him mixed up  so  Dive also said  that she was in the Navy  I was  you were in the Navy  yes I was  when were you in the Navy  my dad was on the USS Chicago  what  what </pre>
