<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter and crude jokes, before moving to a discussion of a Tosh.0 video featuring public urination.  Jim Norton was in studio and participated in the humorous commentary.  The conversation then transitioned to Rob Dyrdek's *Fantasy Factory*,  its stunts, and cast members like Chanel West Coast, with the hosts offering critiques of Dyrdek’s age and perceived attempts to remain relevant. A contentious phone call with a self-promotional podcaster, "Pod Radio," followed, characterized by aggressive back-and-forth and offensive language from both sides.  The hosts ultimately dismissed the podcaster's methods as ineffective. The segment concluded with a discussion on cryptids like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, anxieties of being alone in the woods, and the hosts' characterization of the internet age as the "decade of the asshole."

The show continued with advice for podcasters to have fun, followed by a discussion summarizing different decades.  A hostile exchange with a caller, "Iraqi Bobo," occurred.  The conversation shifted to politics, including John Boehner's re-election and criticism of Peter King. One host adopted the nickname "Sprout."  The hosts discussed Quentin Tarantino's response to Terry Gross's question about movie violence and the Sandy Hook shooting, interspersed with listener calls containing "F.U." lines.  The Colin Ferguson Long Island Railroad shooting and Carolyn McCarthy's gun control advocacy were criticized.  A detailed anecdote about a naked older man at their gym followed, alongside a discussion of Mimi Beardsley's appearance on a news program, her age, and her alleged relationship with Elvis Presley.  Pete Rose's new reality show, "Hits and Misses," was previewed.  The hosts revisited the contentious Tarantino/Gross interview, expressing frustration with what they perceived as disingenuous questions and the hypocrisy surrounding the use of racial slurs, further discussing Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio's responses regarding *Django Unchained*.

The next segment opened with a caller, Joe from Alabama, initiating a discussion about the N-word and the varying reactions to its use depending on context.  The hosts and caller debated the word's offensiveness and perceived hypocrisy in its usage, referencing a Samuel L. Jackson clip.  The conversation then veered towards discussions of the attractiveness of women of different races, filled with crude humor, and an unsuccessful search for a picture of Sophia Vergara's exposed breast.  Further tangents included a trailer parody, discussion of Ice Cube's music, a fictional movie starring Christian Bale and The Iron Sheik, and a Mensa member, Rich Voss, providing inaccurate answers about 20th-century American history.  The segment concluded with a recurring joke about a co-worker, Nicole, and her feet, culminating in her appearance in the studio, leading to relentless teasing and sharing audience reactions to pictures of her feet.  Jim Florentine shared a childhood story about a molestation attempt, and Adam Ferrara made a brief appearance.

The show continued with a discussion about a large, "nasty" foot and the authenticity of a Rex Ryan foot tattoo.  Adam Ferrara recounted high-speed driving experiences, including a near-death incident. He hinted at a scandalous Haitian vacation experience, recounted misadventures involving a dune buggy, tequila, and a woman, and reminisced about dating in the 80s.  Ferrara discussed upcoming appearances and his role in "Nurse Jackie," including details about filming during a hurricane and interactions with Edie Falco.  A lengthy, sexually explicit conversation followed, interspersed with more of Ferrara's experiences and repetitive mentions of Mimi Beardsley.  The conversation branched into entertainment news provided by Nicole, the aftermath of a hurricane, memories of the Long Island 80s music scene, and culminated with a video of Ferrara driving a modified Mustang with hang-glider wings off a cliff.

A chaotic segment followed, beginning with a promotion for Adam Ferrara at Levity Live and focusing on the "Line of the Day" segment, with criticism of E-Rock's selections.  The discussion shifted to *Django Unchained*, the use of the N-word, and varying perspectives on its usage.  DJ Who Kid joined as a guest, contributing to the already vulgar and offensive tone.  The conversation included tangents about Who Kid's wealth, a caller's Hitler-esque mustache, a caller's sexual exploits, a caller's opinions on Italians, further discussion of Nicole's feet, her alleged encounter with Miss USA, Who Kid’s touring experiences, the number of sexual encounters he'd had,  details about Nicole's marital problems,  jokes at Dick Clark's expense, and discussion of Who Kid's children.  The segment was filled with extremely vulgar language, racial slurs, and offensive language towards various groups.

The final segment featured DJ Who Kid discussing his sexual experiences, including an unplanned pregnancy and abortion at 19.  He shared anecdotes from his time as a security guard at the Port Authority, purportedly including an encounter with Fidel Castro.  He discussed his childhood, lack of sex education, and observations on the sexual behavior of children, specifically his 12-year-old son who was smoking weed and had a 12-year-old girl interested in oral sex.  The hosts and Who Kid discussed the changing landscape of teenage sexuality, contrasting their own experiences with the prevalence of sexting and early sexual activity among today's youth.  The conversation included references to various rappers and hip-hop culture, and frequent use of vulgar and offensive language, including racial slurs and sexually explicit terms. The segment concluded with Who Kid encouraging listeners with similar experiences to contact him on Twitter.

[00:00:00]  Satsang with Mooji 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker.  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flatulent.  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, you'll be an Anthony shop.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking about cock and ball. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed and convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  It's he's cocked.  With Opie the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag. 
[00:04:30]  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony the Rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy in the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass,  because it makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful,  but I just can't take them.  The Opie Anthony Show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  What an asshole.  You guys are an asshole.  Oh, that's great.  Good morning, everyone.  We're looking at yellow pee-pee monster on YouTube.  How old are we?  Oh, that's great.  How old are we, man?  He's basically in the tank.  What was this, on Tosh?  Yeah.  Why the fuck won't Tosh come on our show, Jim Norton?  I don't know.  You know Tosh.  I don't know well, but I think I've only met him once or twice. 
[00:05:30]  This show is meant for him if he's trying to promote a little bit.  But has he been in town and said no?  I don't know.  I haven't heard of him being here.  I've never heard of him being anywhere.  He's bigger than us, but I mean, if he needs a little promotion, this is the place to be.  I think he would, but I've never heard of him being here and saying he didn't want to.  He's probably just always known.  We're watching a YouTube video from Tosh's show,  and he's showing a video of a guy that just apparently goes into public restrooms  and pisses all over everything.  And it's just, you know, it's the first person perspective view. 
[00:06:00]  You don't see his dick or anything, but you do see the piss stream just pissing on everything.  The little paper thing you cover the seat with, the toilet paper.  There's cleaning supplies on the floor.  He pisses all over those.  What about the door handle?  The handicapped rail?  Yeah, the handicapped rail.  The toilet paper rolls.  He's just pissing on everything.  He's doing a 360, too.  The sink fucking...  The handrails in.  He's hitting everything.  He's an asshole.  And I think Jimmy said just before we went live,  this guy must have made a visit to SiriusXM. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because our bathrooms are shitty in the morning for whatever reason.  In the garbage pile.  What do you do to a bathroom at the container store?  Pissing on the toilet paper.  I'm saying he, but that might be a woman.  No need to profile.  All over the toilet itself.  This is in the tank.  Here he is, and it's most diabolical.  Come on, not the cleaning supplies.  Mexican ladies have to touch those.  All over the cleaning supplies. 
[00:07:00]  And I'm counting on you guys to help me.  If you see anyone drinking a suspicious amount of liquid, please email the show.  Do not approach the subject.  His bladder's extremely full, and you will get pissed on.  Keep in mind, you might be sitting across from me.  That's really funny.  That's pretty goddamn funny.  Comedy Central allows that, huh?  Comedy Central gets, it's amazing.  It's weird what they allow, though.  Well, they don't show his dick, so he can't prove it's pure.  It could be like, uh...  That's probably how he gets away with it.  Late at night, Tasha's show is fucking, like, uncensored. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  They show and say, like, fuck and shit.  They go all out.  This is the original.  Oh, the original?  Oh.  Well, he's also the face of Comedy Central now.  I mean, Tasha's massive.  Huge.  Oh, God.  Huge.  Not the changing table.  Oh, God.  I'm sure he pisses on everything.  Oh, God.  Not the changing table.  The container store.  That's funny.  Why all the red in this?  Barnes & Noble, I guess.  Look at all the dislikes.  How do you dislike a video like this?  Employees in the container store.  On the plunger. 
[00:08:00]  Again, he really likes pissing on those things you sanitize the seat with.  Right.  Oh, man.  Tasha made it way funnier.  Tasha made it way funnier.  The original video not as good as what Tasha did with it.  We were actually talking right before the show started about the clip shows, video shows  that are all over TV.  I like the shows where people hurt themselves, get hurt.  I like that shit.  That'll never get old.  No.  It's just fucking fantastic.  And that show Ridiculousness on MTV, I mean, I do like watching people hurt themselves. 
[00:08:30]  I can't stand the host.  And I can't stand his guests he gets.  Because it's normal.  Oh, Rob Dierdrick or whatever?  Hasn't he been on our show?  No, he hasn't.  He's blown us off.  He might have been on the phone.  Has he been on the phone?  I can kind of remember something.  Who is he?  I don't know.  Rob Dierdrick.  I think he invented DC Shoes.  I think his company was DC.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a multi-millionaire.  Is he really? 
[00:09:00]  You don't like him?  Well, you know what it is.  I don't mind him.  You know what it is?  He's another one of these guys that I just fucking...  There's a whole bunch of these guys.  They're a little too old to be extreme.  Extreme.  And they usually...  Look how he's dressed.  He's got the flat-brimmed hat turned a little sideways.  That's his look.  That's his company.  Yeah.  Made a lot of money off DC.  Yeah.  And his Fantasy Factory, is it called?  Mm-hmm.  That's a good show.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's so rich and he has nothing to do, so he basically bought a factory and they 
[00:09:30]  do crazy shit in there.  I had no idea.  Really?  I swear.  That show you should check out.  And then he did the show with the black guy.  Robin Bigg.  Robin Bigg was pretty funny.  I remember that one.  I actually don't mind the guy.  Really?  But I watch this show and he just seems like...  I don't know.  He's too...  He's too extreme.  I don't know.  Trying too hard.  Yeah.  And then they get the guests on that are also extreme guys. 
[00:10:00]  Like they had this one guy.  What's his name?  Street Bike fucking...  Mike.  Mike?  Yeah.  Street Bike Mike.  He's like some fucking guy that should be working as his plumber.  And he's like fucking himself up.  Is it Street Bike Mike?  Oh, Street Bike Tommy.  Street Bike Tommy.  I love how you had to stop your...  Is it?  Is it Street Bike Mike?  Street Bike Tommy.  Street Bike Tommy.  Oh, is it really Street Bike Tommy?  Yeah, and Street Bike...  Why wouldn't he change it to Mike?  That would be good on a t-shirt.  But it's like...  The guy is not a kid. 
[00:10:30]  No, but...  And he shouldn't be...  Extreme, extreme.  And then you get people like...  Like some of the jackass people, the peripheral guys have been on the show.  And they're like, let's see the lunacy of this guy.  And it's like...  What about the blonde?  His secretary.  I think she started out as his secretary.  Who, that fucking...  She's kind of hot.  West Coast fucking...  The one.  She always sits on the right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, I know this show.  She is pretty hot.  She's very hot.  I'll give you that one.  And he gets her to do some things during Fantasy...  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Factory, whatever it's called.  Fantasy Factory?  Fantasy Factory.  Are you sure that's the name of it?  It doesn't sound right.  Yeah, I think it's Fantasy Factory.  Chanel West Coast.  Yeah, she's all right.  She laughs at...  She's got a terrible laugh.  She laughs a lot.  But I don't know.  I just...  I'm not into that whole...  Look at me.  I'm fucking crazy.  What am I going to do?  Oh, I take this bicycle.  I'm going up a ramp.  And I'm fucking...  Oh, I slammed up a...  It's like you're 40, dude.  You've never been a fan of the extreme guys.  Extreme!  I don't mind the extreme guys.  When they're fucking like... 
[00:11:30]  What was the one show we used to make fun of with the announcer?  Everything was extreme!  Extreme!  Oh, yeah.  With that over-the-top delivery.  Oh, God.  Enough.  What about Buck Wow?  I guess a lot of people were tweeting me about that last night that I should watch.  I haven't caught it yet, though.  They're going to be the next big stars.  That seems to be, huh?  Yeah, they're definitely going to be stars.  Yeah, I...  So you like the clips.  You just don't like the host.  I love when some dummy rides his bicycle off a stairs outside of the school or something. 
[00:12:00]  He tries to hit the rail and just smashes their chin on it.  Head cracks on the back and they just laid out, knocked the fuck out.  Right.  It's great!  That's one thing that everyone having a camera has brought us.  More of that.  Do we get UFO sightings?  No.  Everyone has a camera now.  We still barely get any.  There's a few little dots of light that people go,  Oh, I think that's a UFO.  No, we don't get that shit.  We don't get Bigfoot.  We should have had a landing by now on tape. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  Not this...  It looks like it might be something still.  Or the Yeti.  We don't get any of that shit.  Well, it's hard to bring the cameras deep into the woods, though.  Well, yeah, but the one time that one guy did,  back in the old days on his horse,  Oh, there's Bigfoot.  Robert Johnson, his name is.  Oh, wow, really?  Robert Johnson.  Did he ever admit that that was a fake?  I think he did.  That just proves there's no Bigfeet.  There's no Loch Ness Monster.  No Bigfeet.  And there ain't no fucking UFOs. 
[00:13:00]  Stop it.  And they're setting up cameras in the woods now, too.  Yeah, they set up those little cameras.  You know, we all...  I don't believe in Bigfoot, but man, if you were in the middle of those woods,  sleeping for the night, you'd be out of your mind scared.  Dude.  Your mind would play fucking games with you.  When I got lost with Melinda that time, upstate in the woods,  we had to spend the night in this fucking camper's lean-to thing that was there  with one coat as our blanket.  I couldn't sleep.  All I did was stare off into the distance, horrified and petrified. 
[00:13:30]  I'm just looking like, please don't see anything.  Make this the most boring night I've ever had in my life.  And that's before you, uh...  I had no gun.  No gun.  I was petrified.  You had to be out of your mind.  I was just like, if something comes...  If I, like, see something...  Like when Charlie Sheen woke up in Platoon,  and he pulls his thing and looks, and it's just the woods.  And then he closes back his blanket again,  and then he opens it up, and you see his eye again, 
[00:14:00]  and he's looking, and the trees pretty much come to life,  and it's the VC.  Right.  Like, just, I'm like, I don't want to see anything.  You were nervous?  I don't want to see a bear.  I don't want to see a person.  I want to see nothing.  The woods are creepy as all.  They're lovely, dark, and deep.  But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep.  Um...  See, I've got some of that, what they call a fucking culture, Sam.  You're a creep.  You forgot that one.  It's Bob Frost.  Bob fucking Frost.  Is that a song?  It's Robert Frost. 
[00:14:30]  No, it's a poem.  Oh.  Is that a song?  But let me tell you, let me tell you why I remember it.  Is that Walt Whitman?  I don't remember it because I studied poetry in any way, shape, or form.  I remember it because it was a code word in a movie called Telefon,  where they said that poem,  and someone had, like, this Manchurian candidate thing in their head,  and they would go and kill somebody.  And that's the only reason I know that.  And you didn't write that down before you came in today?  That just came from your head?  No, just, I remember it from 1970-something. 
[00:15:00]  That's pretty fucked up.  When I was a child of the 80s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've done some hiking and stuff, especially when we lived in Boston.  Scary, right?  It's cool for the first few minutes, and then, yeah.  You start looking out in the distance, you don't want to know what the fuck's out there.  When it starts getting dark, and you're like, and those shadows,  like, shadows in the woods are fucking weird.  Right.  And then any sound.  Well, I told you the story, John O'Brien, our old friend.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We went hiking a couple times, but one night we decided to sleep out. 
[00:15:30]  What?  Really?  Yeah.  He found, like, this stream with sand and stuff.  He's like, look, it's a cool spot.  We're going to spend the night there.  Look at that.  That's real, buddy.  It's real.  The feet are, like, fucking 12 feet long.  That's a great picture.  That's pretty good.  In the sand.  Guy just staring at a huge footprint, dramatically, like, holy fuck, look what I found.  And, you know, we're hiking in when the sun was still up, and I was loving it.  But as soon as that sun starts going down, your whole fucking mind starts fucking with you. 
[00:16:00]  It's all just primal, man, at that point.  You just become a fucking caveman again.  And then we had beer and maybe a little pot.  That could help.  Pot for him, beer for me.  Pot would not help.  Beer would help me.  Pot, I would freak the fuck out.  Pot for him, beer for me.  Oh.  And Clinton had the cocaine.  Oh, Clinton fucking Obama had the cocaine, and I had the crack.  So, uh.  Fucking gurney.  And he sets up the tents.  It's starting to get dark.  He wants to cook some food, so we set up a little campfire, but he's like, ah, I need 
[00:16:30]  more wood.  And he goes off into the complete darkness to find wood.  And I'm like a little fucking bitch a foot away from the tiny fire that he had, figuring  I'd be safe next to the fire.  It's just.  I was a grown man at this point.  And there's no specific thing that you're petrified of.  You know, there's animals.  There's somebody that would just come out and kill you.  Well.  Uh.  What is it?  We did hear noises before he, uh.  Ha ha.  Noises.  Before he head out for fire. 
[00:17:00]  What the fuck was that?  He goes, ah, it's probably a deer.  Probably.  But it could also be a fucking bear.  Could be.  That's what I'm thinking.  So then we eat.  I drank a few beers.  He had a pot.  He might have had a few, uh, few tokes on something.  A few tokes on some weed.  And then he goes, well, there are bears in this area, because we saw the sign for bears.  It says, beware of bears and, you know, protect yourself, whatever.  So he goes, yeah, I gotta, I gotta, like, uh, put all the food in, uh, the pots we cooked  in, uh, in a tree somewhere. 
[00:17:30]  So then he heads downstream in the complete darkness.  What the fuck?  Going, we have to do this, so if the bear, if there are bears in the area, they'll go that  way.  There's no.  Toward the food.  There's no reason to be out there where there's things that can kill you like that.  Make a long story short.  Jesus.  It was kind of like you.  Like, this was supposed to be a fun thing.  The entire night, I'm just laying there wide-eyed, waiting for morning.  And he's, like, snoring away like this is normal.  You just lay on your side, and you look out into the woods, and you're like, just don't. 
[00:18:00]  No, please don't see anything.  I felt like I was safe, because I was in my tiny little tent.  I figured that little.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The little nylon between me and the bear would be good enough.  Nylon barrier's perfect.  Yeah, that works great.  So I kind of felt safe inside the tent.  And I thought the second I shut my eyes to go to sleep, when I opened them again, like,  there'd be just something right near my face.  Oh, yeah, all that shit.  I just, I just see, I wonder what that comes from.  I wonder what childhood memory that comes from.  Oh, boy, go to the flow chart.  Go to the flow chart. 
[00:18:30]  Something right near my face, it reeked of whiskey.  I was so worried that there'd be a big snake hanging there.  And then, man, as soon as that sun came up, let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  Then it's, you know, you're back to being the number one honcho.  I was, it was, I'm glad I did some hiking and shit, but, I mean, people are probably laughing  at us right now.  They do.  I know.  They do this all the time.  Like, it's nothing.  I don't care.  I'm glad I went hiking, too, because I realized that I would never go hiking again. 
[00:19:00]  I'm done.  Done with hiking.  Opie, Bigfoot is real.  The Patterson footage is real.  It's a female.  Look close.  She has boobies, and they jiggle.  Oh, Robert Patterson.  I said Robert Johnson.  Sorry.  Oh.  Who's Bobby Johnson?  Oh, that's the old school footage he's talking about?  Ratspin?  Yeah, it's from 67.  Robert Patterson's fake.  I like Ratspin from Vegas, so.  He's a dummy.  The guy admitted it was fake.  He did admit.  Yeah, it's a fake.  He was lying.  Yeah, it's a fake, sir.  Yeah, we would have found, like, some real remains by now. 
[00:19:30]  Something.  I've gone hunting.  No, they don't, Opie, because they cart off their dead, because they're intelligent.  So when one of them dies, they cart them off, and they, you know, do with the bodies what  they do.  No, really.  But it's like, look, we cart off our dead, too, and there's still fucking, people find  dead bodies laying around.  I would say we're way more intelligent, and we don't even want to help each other move.  No, right?  So, like, if one of our friends dies, we're going to make sure that we carry him off?  Yeah.  And how about the Bigfoot Cemetery? 
[00:20:00]  Where's the Bigfoot Cemetery?  Cemetery.  Where there's a bunch of fucking big feet buried.  Yeah.  One big quarry somewhere.  I think that's it.  Quarry.  Toss them in.  Yeah.  I don't believe in Bigfoot at all.  Or that dumb Loch Ness Monster.  No, the biggest photo there was a fake, too.  Yeah.  The surgeon's photo.  The Loch Ness Monster, right.  That's all phony shit, too.  Just stop already.  Remember those shows and movies that used to be when we were growing up, and it was all 
[00:20:30]  about, you know, the Loch Ness Monster, and those mystery shows with Leonard Nimoy.  In Search O's.  Iraq, did we do this bit?  Yeah.  No, I don't think this one.  No, we've done.  No, we have done this one.  I remember that one.  We've talked about.  In Search O's was great, but then they started running out of things to find.  Yeah, and it really got stupid.  Yeah.  Because it was like Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, UFOs, and then it was psychic phenomena.  That's right.  And then after that, it's like, hmm, my keys.  My car keys. 
[00:21:00]  My dentures.  Where did I put my dentures?  Jimmy, the dude you were talking about is on the phone.  Oh, good.  Oh.  From yesterday.  Oh, boy.  Who's this?  Yeah, it's Pod Radio.  Oh, okay.  Are you taping us for your stupid show?  No, I'll let one of your fans send me the recording like they did yesterday.  Fans.  Fans.  Okay, good.  Go ahead, brother.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up? 
[00:21:30]  What's up, Jimmy?  What's up, Jimmy?  Oh, what's up?  Well, we addressed it yesterday.  We kind of addressed it, but you don't listen.  I was asleep, man.  I was asleep.  I wasn't on my computer.  Why don't you give us your history of being a broadcaster?  Where do you come from?  Well, first of all, I...  Because you think you're like...  Because you think you're hot shit.  So where did you come from?  Have you been broadcasting for a while?  Why the big, over-the-top personality and attitude?  Well, I'll tell you how it started.  I mean, I'm actually a rapper. 
[00:22:00]  I started as a rapper, okay?  I've got songs with, like, Big Pond, Cypress Hill, people like that.  You know what I mean?  What do you mean you're a rocker?  What do you do for those bands?  A rapper.  A rapper.  Oh, a rapper.  Yeah, I rap.  I used to rap, like, in Arabic, too.  You know, I was born and raised in Iraq.  Anything we would know.  You ever hear Allah Akbar?  What's that?  What's that, Anthony?  Anything we know.  Hostile.  I mean, listen, this is how Head Radio started.  Anything we know that you rapped. 
[00:22:30]  Is there any songs you might recognize that you're on?  If you go on iTunes and type Kevin Keller, you'll find my shit.  You know what I mean?  Kevin Keller?  I'm not.  I mean, I've written shit for other people and stuff like that.  And, Tal Head Radio was a hip-hop station.  Well, you're coming across a little desperate.  What's that about?  You're, like, tweeting everybody over and over again.  And I don't know if that's going to work for you.  Certainly, you're getting a big hit right here because you're on our show.  But I don't know if that's going to translate to an actual audience. 
[00:23:00]  Dude, when I hit someone up like you, like, this is my thing, right?  When I hit Anthony or Jimmy or whatever, I'm talking to you, like, not just as a fan, as a man-to-man, you know?  You guys see my tweets, you know what I mean?  I honestly have never seen one of your tweets.  Okay, not you, maybe.  And then I look back because of Jimmy talking about you yesterday.  And I see that you have tweeted me, but it wasn't anything of interest that I would remember. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  I don't remember anybody tweeting over and over again, like, plugs.  Yeah, like, what you did was you misread something.  Like, you think that I was, oh, I can make fun of celebrities, but you can't.  Like, I don't care what you say.  I didn't want your ability to say what you want taken.  I wasn't offended by what you said.  It was the fact that you tweeted the same thing repeatedly with my name and an at mention.  So when you at mention somebody, it means you want them to see it. 
[00:24:00]  So you're basically saying to me, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.  It's like you keep knocking on the door.  So what do you want me to do?  Well, haven't you blocked me?  When you block me, you can't see my heart mention.  So when I'm doing that.  I only blocked you right then.  I blocked you a couple of days ago because I was irritated.  And then I unblocked you yesterday after the segment.  I'm like, okay.  Because I figured, I'm guessing you're over in England.  So I figured you're a six-hour difference. 
[00:24:30]  So I figured maybe that was why you didn't hear us.  But I didn't block you because I was offended.  Then you come out with me with a different name.  And you try to plug in.  Hey, it's Talia Radio.  Like, what are you doing, dude?  Like, I like, I'll go after people I don't like.  But I've never at mentioned people on Twitter and then expected them to give me something  or resented them for not giving me something.  It's like, what do you want?  It's like this how I did it.  And even like with you after you blocked me, I don't mean yesterday. 
[00:25:00]  Like, the first time you blocked me.  That's the only time I blocked you.  That's the only time I blocked you.  Yeah, so you can't see that at mentioned.  Once you blocked me, how can you see it?  I'm not doing the at mentions because I'm replying to.  You're not, you know how I do it.  I only blocked you.  Dude, I blocked you only after all those at mentions.  Jimmy explained it perfectly.  That was the only time.  I blocked you a day or two ago after all those at mentions.  It was at night and I was just like, I saw the same thing repeated. 
[00:25:30]  It was like Bobo does on the show.  I was just like, fuck this.  I'm not looking at this.  But I don't want, you can say what you want.  I didn't contact Twitter.  He's harassing me.  I don't give a shit.  But if you're saying it to me repeatedly and then I'm like, I don't want to hear this.  All of a sudden, I can't handle a joke made at me.  It's bullshit.  The way I saw it, man, you got to see it from my point, dude.  I'm so fucking bored with this guy.  But dude, how do I have to see it as your point of view? 
[00:26:00]  Shut the fuck up, you cock.  Raise your head, Opie.  Come here.  Why do you have to?  Wait, wait, wait.  Opie, Opie, Opie, come here.  What are you doing?  Are you doing a dumb little bit?  You're doing a little bit?  Is this your bit today?  Are you going to replay this on your show and think you're a hero?  You're a furniture motherfucker.  You're a furniture.  Oh, that's wonderful.  You're relevant.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You didn't finish the, uh...  Why don't you answer Jimmy's question?  Opie, what is your talent?  What is your question?  What is your talent? 
[00:26:30]  I don't have to explain what my talent is to a podcast, trust me.  I don't have to explain what my talent is to a podcast, trust me.  I've got my own fans, okay?  And if I want to fucking diss Jimmy, I'll diss Jimmy, okay?  No one's going to stop me.  Good for you, but answer Jimmy's question.  I'm a fucking big corporation like you.  Answer fucking Jimmy's question.  I basically just said to you, I explained myself pretty well.  You're just a little bitch.  Just answer Jimmy's question.  That's all we're trying to do today.  You got the attention of our show, so answer Jimmy's question.  What's the question?  I just kind of told you, and you said, well, I handle things my own way. 
[00:27:00]  It's like, okay, but then just don't get upset if somebody blocks you.  Like, why do you care?  I don't care what you're saying.  I don't want your right to say what you want removed.  Say what you want.  It doesn't mean anything to me.  But if I block you because it's irritating, don't get mad at me.  It's like you keep dialing the phone to my house, and I keep answering, and you're saying the same thing.  So all of a sudden, if I block your number, you're mad.  Dude, why are you taking it personal, man? 
[00:27:30]  I told you.  This is my only promotional tool.  But again, that's your business.  I don't have a corporation like you guys.  But we didn't do what you're doing.  Just do a good fucking podcast, and if it is good, people will start listening.  Word will get out.  We didn't have anyone help us.  I didn't pester people into helping me.  We didn't run around desperately trying to get the attention of bigger radio shows.  We just fucking did our show.  Dude, when I do, do I diss your fans?  No.  I send them a link.  I'm like, yo, check this out.  Starhead Radio.  But I don't know if you diss the fans. 
[00:28:00]  You can.  It doesn't matter to me if you do.  I laugh at it.  I laugh at it, man.  I've heard two minutes of your podcast yesterday because it came up with Jimmy, and that's it.  I don't know anything about it.  No.  Yeah.  And after this phone call, I won't be searching it out.  I don't give a fuck.  No, I'm the best, man.  I'm the funny guy.  No, you're not really the best.  You don't believe that, dude.  You don't believe that.  The two minutes I heard yesterday, trust me, you're not even close to the best.  You're better than Rogan?  Yeah.  You're better than Joe Rogan?  You're better than Joe Rogan?  You're better than Bill Burr? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  You're better than Jay Moore?  You're better than Fred from Brooklyn?  Right?  I'm better than Howard Stern.  Oh, God.  What you're doing, dude, is...  Good for you.  I kind of know what you're doing.  You're trying to get into this headspace of going after shows that are bigger because you think  they'll look at you like, oh, this guy doesn't take any prisoners.  This guy's not afraid at all.  Who is this guy?  But it's not an intriguing quality.  Well, I was scared when he called me furniture.  I was, like, petrified.  That was just amazing.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's not...  I need more from this guy. 
[00:29:00]  It's just amazing.  But, again, you're making my point.  You're making my point, dude.  You sound like an idiot.  Will you relax and have a conversation?  You're making my point.  Because you've done this to other people, in 23 years of stand-up, I've never done that  to somebody.  It's not the way you do it.  If you want to do it, fine.  But then just don't cry about it if you get blocked.  Oh, yeah, but the thing I thought, you got pissed off at me, like, because of that joke.  That's what I thought.  I was, like, yo...  Well, I know, but you're incorrect, and I'm telling you you're incorrect. 
[00:29:30]  He's told you now three or four times that you're incorrect.  I don't even remember.  I blocked you because you just were too repetitive.  It was just the same thing over and over and over.  It wasn't anything...  I have a question for you.  It wasn't anything you said.  I just blocked you.  Can I ask you a question?  Of course.  Here comes the...  No, no, no.  What do you think of Kim Kardashian having a baby with Kanye West?  I don't give a shit.  That's a tragedy, man.  Fuck that shit.  Are you trying to, like...  Have you motherfuckers gave up on this shit?  Come on, dude.  What the fuck?  I'm the bad guy?  Who's the bad guy? 
[00:30:00]  This guy's terrible.  You're really bad, dude.  He's terrible.  I mean, honestly, good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  Anyone trying to do radio or podcasts, and I, you know, I'll say good luck to you, but...  Jesus.  If this was an act...  Oh, my God.  It would kind of be funny.  Keep it up.  We'll feature you on the next October.  We'll have fun with you.  Listen, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, my dude, listen.  Your bars block me, okay?  You block me.  Jim's block me.  You're not the only...  Jim fucking...  Even Howard Stern has blocked me. 
[00:30:30]  What does that tell you?  Dude, what does that tell you?  If that's your thing, if you want a lot of people blocking you...  Raise your head, Opie.  Opie, raise your head.  What does this tell you?  You're a mother's pussy for saying I can't fucking do radio.  What does this tell you?  I'm the boss.  See, you know you can't do radio.  That's why it hurts so much.  That's why it hurts so much.  But keep at it.  You have a lot of talent, Opie.  What's your talent?  Tell me.  I don't have to prove nothing to you, sir.  I've been doing this since I was 18.  I think I've proven myself.  You've been doing it, what, a couple months? 
[00:31:00]  Good for you.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  You won't even come close to what I've done in this business.  Keep up your good nature.  Exactly.  If all these comics have blocked you, dude, what does that tell you?  I mean, honestly, I know you're doing shtick right now.  I get it.  I've been on the phone.  Doing phoners is difficult.  I hate it.  I hate calling into places.  But I'm just telling you, like, stick aside.  If I've blocked you, and I did unblock you after the segment yesterday.  Anthony blocked you.  Burr?  You got Bill Burr to block you?  Yeah, really?  Like, what does that, dude, what does that tell you? 
[00:31:30]  Like, that should really make you question.  None of us are afraid of what you're saying.  It's not threatening.  It's not, uh-oh.  It's not like that at all.  You're not being blocked because you're saying things that offend us or upset us or a joke  that we can't take.  You're being blocked because you're just annoying as far as your repetitiveness of just, you  keep tweeting the same thing over and over, so you're swatted like a fly.  It's not like you're this big power to be reckoned with. 
[00:32:00]  You're just annoying.  You're just annoying.  That's my point.  This is my point with Anthony and you guys.  It's like, I just want to chomp like you guys.  Open the door.  Then fucking do your stupid show, and maybe people will listen to you.  That's what happened to us.  We never had anyone fucking bring us up and do the way you're doing it.  You idiot, just do your stupid podcast, and if it's good, people will listen.  Listen to it.  That's right.  Listen, listen.  You're going about it the wrong way.  How many times do we have to tell you?  You're doing it the wrong way, dude. 
[00:32:30]  Because all the guys that you're blocking are guys you probably would want on your stupid  podcast someday.  Right.  You're an idiot.  When I hit you up, I'll hit fucking Joe Rogan and be like, okay, do you want to be on my show?  You're hit...  Ugh.  What do I say?  What do I do?  Do you know?  I'll tell you what you do.  I'll tell you what you do.  Fuck you motherfucker.  I'll tell you what you do.  What you're doing now...  There's the scary fucking attitude.  The shtick is...  The shtick is...  The shtick is so embarrassing.  I can't even tell you.  It is embarrassing, dude, because you're trying to get something done, and you're not 
[00:33:00]  earning it.  You want to earn respect to the business.  You earn respect to the business by being funny and entertaining over a long period of  time until people can't ignore you.  You don't pester people and go, look what I did.  It's like a little child running...  But that's what it's like.  It's like a little kid running...  Yeah, but how are you going to find out about it?  Hold on, dude.  I'm telling you something very real.  I don't have marketing.  I don't have people like you.  Look, but you have the internet.  You have the internet.  Your podcast can just go up, and people can hear it, and word of mouth, it gets... 
[00:33:30]  All I do, when people mention you, I'll be like, hey, here's my link, listen to the show.  This is all I do.  I never say, oh, you piece of shit, listen to this, you know?  That's all you should do, is this is my link, listen to my show.  And I mention it to you, because, you know, sometimes, you know, the Twitter clients just,  you know...  Look.  It replies to everyone on the list.  Look, man.  When me and Ant started out, no one gave a shit about us.  No one knew our names, but we didn't fucking desperately reach out to others.  We just did our stupid show. 
[00:34:00]  We would just interview people at a radio station, because that's the only people that wanted  to go on the dumb show.  And now, fast forward, we talk to A-listers.  Yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to do.  Then do your stupid show.  That's all you can do.  Not piss everyone off, because that's not going to work in the end.  How many times do we have to tell you?  Yeah, you know...  I'm a fucking genius at this shit, you idiot.  And you're going about it the wrong way.  Period.  There's an old expression, dude. 
[00:34:30]  If you want what I have, do what I did.  That's a very old expression.  And what I did, and I mean, as a stand-up, it's a little bit different, is I kind of...  I worked, I busted my ass, and people eventually helped me, because they liked me and they liked  what I did.  Not once, in all the years of radio, stand-up, anything, did I pester and nag people.  People to help me.  Never.  Because they wouldn't have.  I wish...  Believe me, there's guys I want to nag.  You think I don't want to nag Kevin Hart to put me in a movie?  I can't do it. 
[00:35:00]  You can't do that.  You'll never...  All you're going to do is get blocked.  Like, why would you go after Rogan?  Like, not because he's physically a menacing guy, but he's a very, very good broadcaster.  He's an entertaining, funny dude.  And he's a very good dude.  He's a great dude, yes.  That actually helps a lot of people out.  Yeah.  Well, all I do is, like, yo, come on my podcast, and he never replies, and he can see my...  I'm sure that's all you did.  I'm sure that's all you did.  Why don't you fucking...  I'm sure that's all you did.  Why don't you tweet Tom Cruise and say, hey, come in my movie? 
[00:35:30]  What the fuck do you think?  People are just supposed to respond to you?  Yeah.  It sounds desperate.  Hold on a minute.  And if you want real advice, it sounds desperate how you're going about it.  It's not desperate.  For me, it's like...  Because I guarantee you tweeted at Rogan a lot more than just that one tweet you just said.  You're coming across desperate.  Just do your show.  Find interesting things around you to talk about.  And then hopefully it grows from there.  What?  Dude, I don't have...  I don't have...  Like, your show, this is, like, it's word of mouth, right? 
[00:36:00]  The way I came across your show is because of Louis C.K., because of Patrice O'Neal.  And that's how I found Jimmy Norton, like, part of your show.  You know what I mean?  I don't have Siri FM.  I don't have big marketing companies.  And I'm someone who works in marketing.  Oh, my God.  You don't listen to anything we said.  We got to hang up and move on.  You're not listening to anything we said.  We didn't just start out having Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neal and Jim Norton on our show.  That's the point I'm making today.  It's going to take years if you're... 
[00:36:30]  It's going to take fucking years to get something going.  Here's what you have.  I don't have years, man.  Yes, see, there you go.  There you go.  You just said it.  Good luck to you.  You don't have years.  You want it fast.  And you're frustrated and impatient that it's not being given to you.  Well, you have to earn what you get.  Let's go to your Twitter.  You know who Jenny Johnson is?  I love Jenny Johnson.  Isn't she just a mom somewhere?  Yeah, she's got a little something going on. 
[00:37:00]  A little bit of a writer.  And she works local...  She used to work at a local TV station in Houston, I believe.  So how do I know who she is?  Because of you and other people who retweeted her?  The world knows Jenny Johnson.  She was just a nobody on Twitter.  Now she's got like well over a million followers, I believe.  How many followers is she up to?  She's got a lot.  And she makes every Twitter list.  She is fucking famous from Twitter.  Just from Twitter.  From being entertaining on Twitter.  Here's your last tweets, Tallyhead Radio.  You retweeted somebody, Jim Norton on Opie and Anthony's segment, calling me out earlier today. 
[00:37:30]  That was 10 hours.  11 hours ago, your tweet was, listen to Jim Norton bit on me on the Opie and Anthony show.  The next one before that, which was 14 hours ago.  You are hilarious and deserve a shot to be on the Opie and Anthony.  Hey, thanks, man.  You responded to somebody complimenting you.  And then you write to me, hey, man, I was asleep.  I called tomorrow if you want to explain.  The Twitter before that was to Manuel. 
[00:38:00]  You write, thanks, man.  The Twitter to that was before, was to Master Plan.  You write, thanks, dude.  Before that, you write, all you Opie and Anthony fans, how do I listen to morning show?  I was asleep.  Here's the point I'm making.  All these tweets, there's not one joke in there.  No.  There's not one thing that you're saying that will make people want to retweet you other  than you saying, look at me.  There was a girl I blocked.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me, Tony. 
[00:38:30]  That's, yeah.  You're not.  People don't retweet.  Like, I'm a plug whore.  And even I don't do it like that.  Most of my tweets, I try to be funny.  I try to either say something socially that I want to say right or wrong.  And I do plug.  But you're just yelling out plugs.  Thanks to, there's nothing entertaining about these tweets.  What have you done in any of these last 10 tweets that I've read that would encourage  anybody to go, hey, let me listen to this guy.  Or why would anyone even want to follow you on Twitter?  Right. 
[00:39:00]  And you get a tweet and you're like, oh, I want to follow that guy.  Why?  Because he's saying, follow me?  I'm like, because I'm like, can you hear me?  Yeah.  But dude, do you hear what we're saying?  Like, for real.  Dude, I understand you, Bob.  We're actually trying to help you and you're not listening.  I'm listening.  I'm listening very like.  Instead, you got to go out, try to be outrageous.  You're not going to be more outrageous than us ever.  Relax.  I'm like that Paris Hilton dude without the gay shit.  You know what I mean?  That's how I am.  Well, tweet that.  I attack celebrities when people like us. 
[00:39:30]  You know what I mean?  You got to.  Maybe you like rap and you're familiar with that world.  Maybe they do it a different way.  Maybe guys in rap.  It's like if I'm coming from like a beef cult, not a beef, but you know, like the battling  culture.  That doesn't work.  If you're going to battle with comics or whatever, if you're funny, that's one thing.  But if you're just saying the same thing over and over again, you know, it's you're going  to lose people very quickly.  And I'm just telling you, by looking at your tweets, there's nothing in those last X amount  of tweets and many before that where I see, hey, this guy's writing some funny or interesting 
[00:40:00]  stuff.  Every one of them is just, here's my podcast.  You're just saying, look, look, look, look, look.  But you're not giving people any reason to come and look.  Twitter is a great, Twitter is a great smoke signal.  You send it up and people go, wow, I want to look over there because what you're saying  is interesting, but you're not saying that you're using Twitter as a bullhorn.  You don't get followers by telling people to retweet you.  You get them by putting something out there that people want to retweet. 
[00:40:30]  And none of this shit is easy.  Twitter is not easy.  Doing radio is not easy.  Trying to find an audience is not easy.  It takes time.  Like I built up my fan base, like my main idea, which is I have like 15,000 followers on the  top.  I got around 3,000.  You know what I mean?  Lost a few, whatever.  It's all good.  So this is all built up by myself.  No corporate funding.  No nothing.  Okay.  They keep going.  Corporate funding.  They keep going.  Yeah.  They keep going.  We work for a big corporation.  They don't fucking help us. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  They don't promote us at all.  They put our picture on a pamphlet every once in a while.  That's it.  All I want.  All I want.  I sound like that fucking dude from the Godfather.  All I want.  When he talks to...  Oh, God.  Salazzo.  Here's a hint.  All I want.  Salazzo.  And Michael, we're talking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All I want.  All I want.  Yeah, yeah.  All I want.  Basically.  All I want.  I'm not doing the same, motherfucker.  Let me just fucking say my thing.  Like, all I want is you guys or anyone.  Even like... 
[00:41:30]  Because Jim Norton, let's be honest, man.  You're not like a...  Are you an A-list celeb or no?  No.  I would never claim to be or think I am.  No.  D-list, maybe.  If someone...  Like, I'm not even a D-list.  I'm like a Z-list, okay?  Oh, my God.  If I ask you, hey, want to be on my podcast?  That will help me.  You know what I mean?  I'm not like Tom Cruise or people like that to be on my podcast.  I hate Joe Rogan.  Like, yo, do my shit.  Or Bill Burr.  I'm a fan of you motherfuckers as well.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Be like, yo, come on my show.  I want to talk to you guys. 
[00:42:00]  I've interviewed some porn stars, some underground rappers, etc., etc.  But I need bigger names.  You know?  That's how people start coming and listening.  But you see...  Do you have mental issues?  I just need to know.  Say what?  Seriously, are you...  Do you have mental issues?  Emotional issues?  Are you mentally unstable?  What's your deal?  I'm asking.  You can just say no to question.  Okay, no.  Okay, no.  Yes.  Whatever makes you happy, bro.  What you're saying, dude.  That was a fair question. 
[00:42:30]  Forget it, man.  Forget it.  Good luck to you.  Are we done with this guy, Jimmy?  You done with him?  Yeah.  This is your thing.  I mean...  Certainly not mine.  I'll tell you, dude.  Certainly not mine.  Just listening to what you said about...  You know, I asked Rogan to come on the show.  I asked you or Bill Burr to come on the show.  You asked people for something and you didn't get what you wanted fast enough because you  didn't earn it and made people want to go on your show.  People want to go on your show when they hear about it, when it becomes a bigger show. 
[00:43:00]  And then people are like, well, hey, I want to go on that show.  I want to be a part of that show.  But you're just yelling, come on my show.  And when people don't respond, you act like a petulant child.  Do you know what Bill Burr would be doing if he went on everybody's podcast that asked  him to be on their podcast?  Exactly.  Ruining them.  Bill Burr gets asked to be on a lot of people's podcasts.  I'm certain of it.  And the only ones he'll go on are ones where he's like, oh, that's pretty cool.  I'll fucking go there.  Oh, look.  They're talking about the banks.  I'll go on that one. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Well, good luck to you, man.  I mean, all right.  And Opie.  Opie, you can suck my dick.  That's wonderful.  You're gay, I guess.  I guess you're gay, right?  You're gay, right?  Sick fantasies.  Keep them to yourself.  Good luck to you, loser.  That guy has problems.  But he's got problems.  Let's be honest here.  The guy's got some type of fucking problems.  I think a bit of narcissism and some self-centeredness. 
[00:44:00]  I don't think he's crazy.  No, I think.  But I think there's an emotional issue there.  I was sensing an emotional issue there.  Something.  Everyone throws Asperger's around.  I'm a magnet for that shit.  But it's.  That's why he went after me.  I'm a magnet for that crap.  Trust me.  But he's just.  Oof.  He's abrasive.  It's not easy.  We've been at this all a really long fucking time.  And now with the podcasting, everyone is really.  They start a podcast and they're frustrated. 
[00:44:30]  They're not getting.  Yeah.  They think they're going to get fucking numbers and they think they're going to get guests.  And they think it's all.  It's.  That's how it works.  No, it doesn't.  Like Jim.  But Jim had a great example of that with Twitter.  You can't just say, hey, this is me.  Hey, this is me.  Look at me.  Hey, look at me.  Thank you for looking at me.  This is me.  Hey.  You got to fucking put something up there.  That's going to make people go.  Holy shit.  That was pretty funny.  And then all of a sudden you look and go.  Oh, I got more followers because that got passed around because it was funny.  Right.  That's how it works. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  You don't just once people notice you, they don't all of a sudden like you or follow you.  Right.  Being noticed is not the issue.  You have to get when people look, you better have something ready for them.  Right.  And that's that's what gets you Twitter followers.  It's people like you and they don't like you and they retweet you or they don't retweet you.  It's no secret.  And you're delusional to think, you know, Rogan's going to go on your podcast.  It's insane.  I mean, maybe someday, maybe someday when we first started out where we would have loved to talk  to all the big fucking comics and movie stars and TV stars, we were like, fuck, that would 
[00:45:30]  be awesome.  But guess what?  We knew it wasn't going to happen.  Right.  But look at who we got.  Paul Bond.  So we got Paul Bond and Billy Staples.  Billy Staples.  And did shit with our interns.  See?  Exactly.  You know, you make things happen.  That's how it works.  You start crazy promotions that catch on like the famous Whip them out Wednesday.  Right.  You know?  And that's how you get attention.  You give them something.  When people pass around like audio bits on YouTube or whatever, they don't pass around 
[00:46:00]  somebody going, hi, I'm Jim Norton.  Hi, I'm Jim Norton.  Hi, I'm Jim.  They pass around something funny you might say or a bit you might do that's funny.  That's what word of mouth is.  It's when you are screaming at people to look at you, which is what all performers are really  doing.  Yeah.  We're all begging to be looked at.  But you can't just do it literally.  No.  You have to make people want to look at you by making them laugh or intriguing them or whatever  it is you're doing.  Right.  You know what I mean?  You know why?  I love following a guy like Rogan, for example. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  If he wasn't my friend, if I didn't like Joe, I'd still follow him on Twitter because he  sends out interesting links.  Right.  All this weird conspiracy stuff or these medical facts or these interesting videos.  You know you're going to get something from his account.  You're getting something out of it.  I love his account.  Yeah.  There's always something.  He does a little promotion.  I mean, Twitter certainly, you know, it helps with that, but you can't just be that.  Yeah.  It's part of it's promotion.  People accept that, too.  They don't mind if you promote once in a while.  They're okay with it.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing wrong with a little me. 
[00:47:00]  Me!  Yay!  But then you've got to have some other shit.  Like, fucking, I love Pat from Unaki's Twitter.  He's just fucking, he's tragic comedy.  It's great.  That shit's funny.  Yeah.  And what's Pat's Twitter?  Oh, I have no fucking idea.  Yeah, I have no idea.  God, this is the big fucking plug for him.  I know.  We don't know his actual Twitter.  I just follow him.  Just Google, yuck.  I'm kidding, Pat. 
[00:47:30]  What is it, young Samuel?  It's Pat from Unaki without the O.  So it's Pat, F-R-M, Unaki.  Pat from Unaki.  And no one knows how to spell Unaki.  M-O-O-N-A-C-H-I-E.  Instead of just putting Unaki Pat, which people could remember, Pat from without the O, which  are the Unaki and O.  I know.  Pat's an ass with one S.  Oh, God.  You think he got us? 
[00:48:00]  Because he thinks he got us.  Well, you know what?  That'll be hilarious for him.  He'll put it on his little show.  Cut those motherfuckers.  Talk about how he got us.  Did ya?  The internet has changed everything.  I've been thinking.  Now, in the past, I've said it before.  Every decade has its, I call it like a feel to it.  You get a feel.  When you think back to the 80s, don't you have a certain kind of, this notion of it?  A feel?  It had a certain feel.  No stupid haircuts and no guitars. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's the 80s.  That's part of it.  The sitcoms that were around, it all comes together to give a decade this feel.  The 90s have a feel to it.  That grunge thing.  The 90s, hair in the eyes, sadness.  Right.  Sadness.  But it's not any one thing, the clothing, the music.  It's everything put together comes across.  So when you look back at it, you remember it in this very visceral way.  I never figured out how long it takes before you recognize that decade, because when you're 
[00:49:00]  in it, it's very hard to get that feel from it, because you're in it.  And then a couple of years into the next decade, you still don't quite get it.  But I'm just starting to feel the thousands.  It's getting a feel to it.  Is it called the thousands?  That's what I call it.  Yeah.  It's getting a feel to it.  It's the decade of the asshole.  It's the asshole.  Were you going that way?  It is true, because the internet...  It's the decade of the asshole.  The internet has come in to this, where everyone is accessible, and everyone... 
[00:49:30]  You don't just sit alone at home anymore and be that lonely person.  You now let everyone know you're that lonely person at home.  It's the decade of the internet, and social media, and it's getting a feel to it.  It's this really weird thing of entitlement, and everyone feels they deserve...  Everything, because they see it on...  They feel like they deserve it right away.  Right away. 
[00:50:00]  It's mine.  Look, I could talk to this guy right away.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Love you on the show.  Why the fuck aren't you doing something for me?  And those are the guys that will never have a chance.  Yeah.  If you're podcasting...  I know a lot of our listeners are podcasting now.  The advice I would give you, just have fun.  Turn on those fucking mics and just have a good time, and don't worry about it.  Yeah.  It's the best advice I could give you.  Remember back in the day, our old bosses, when we were kind of cool with them, Bruce 
[00:50:30]  Mittman used to just say to us, he goes, hey, guys, go in there and have fun.  Right.  That's all he cared about.  Go in there, have a good time.  Have a good time.  He would say that a lot.  And babysit my kids while you're at it.  Well, sure.  But try to have fun.  And I'll be eavesdropping from my car with the secret fucking phone number.  With the secret phone, but...  Besides that, have a good time.  Have a pisser.  Oh, yeah.  And then I'm going to take you to the Chinese restaurant and yell at you.  Right.  But then go back in and just have fun.  But he did say have fun a lot.  And that's good advice.  Yeah.  Don't take it too seriously.  Don't think you're going to be a star overnight. 
[00:51:00]  Don't feel desperate about it.  Just, you know, make a living some other way to get the money coming in.  And just turn on those mics with your pals and have a good time.  Have some fun.  And you never know what's going to happen.  See what happens.  A guy like the one we just talked to, he doesn't have a shot.  Oh, not a chance in hell.  Doesn't have a shot.  And what throws him off, it's the way he goes about it.  He may be an entertaining guy.  I don't know.  But the way he goes about it is terrible.  And that is what's going to hurt you.  Yeah.  Because people, there's so many options. 
[00:51:30]  There's a million options of entertainment now.  No one's going to look that way.  No.  Yelling louder doesn't make people look.  No.  Can we do the other decades, by the way?  Yes.  I got the 80s with the bad haircuts and no guitars.  We need the 50s, the 60s, and the 70s.  And maybe a better one for the 90s.  The 50s, I think of, is, well, it's obviously a lot about the music.  You watch things like.  But how do you sum it up in like four or five words? 
[00:52:00]  Sochers and greasers.  I think there was a certain, yeah, everybody was a bit naive.  Patriotic.  Very patriotic.  Yes.  Yes.  Crew cutty.  Yeah.  Fucking jackets, ties.  But we've got to summarize it somehow.  Like, what captures the 50s?  Going along with the system, you know, you're kind of. 
[00:52:30]  You can look at it as far as music goes, because that'll make you a little easier.  Not really outside the boundaries.  Naive is a good way to look at a hopeful.  Like, people had hope and faith in things and in the system back then.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going to promote a lot of podcasts today, I've decided.  Oh, good.  Yes, I am.  Geek Things Podcast is the first one.  I don't even know if it's good.  Oh.  But here's a guy just being cool on Twitter.  He's not, like, fucking begging for a plug.  Here's your guy. 
[00:53:00]  He's actually retweeting one of my things.  Oh.  And I'm not saying which one, because it's not about that.  But that's what he's doing.  He's not, like, going, me, me, me.  Tunnel videos?  No, actually, Jimmy has Chip in the bathroom.  You got me a couple.  It's a pretty funny video.  You got me a couple times with that one last night.  Oh, sorry.  The tunnel is nuts.  Oh, no, that was still Ian Rhymes.  It's like, ooh, and I click on it.  It's like, oh, Jesus.  That fucking trick shot has gotten me so many times.  Another angle in the Zapruder film.  Oh, well, I got to see that.  You know how bad that's gotten?  It's gotten me. 
[00:53:30]  Fucking assholes are now tweeting me going, dude, you got to see this fucking video.  Hilarious video.  And then I click on it.  It's my stupid basketball trick shot video.  Assholes.  What were we getting at?  Oh, the 50s.  So, or the 60s.  Or the 70s.  Yeah, yeah.  70s, everyone was smiling a lot.  70s, though, is, I don't know, polyester.  Psychedelics.  Phony.  Phoniness.  A lot of colors.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know.  Maybe it's not working.  Patriotic.  Nah, I mean, it's hard to, I mean, you know.  If we got it.  It's so hard to sum up because it's just this weird feeling you get.  Certain, it's a feeling.  Like, when you watch The Breakfast Club, which was on recently.  Yeah.  That captures the 80s.  I don't know why.  It does, yes.  But it feels 80s.  It just feels different.  Absolutely.  What captures the 70s?  Certain outdoor scenes.  Like, when you watch, like, The French Connection or certain cars.  Like, there's certain.  The 70s is gritty. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  I'd like to teach the world to sing.  It's gritty.  It was gritty.  Yeah, yeah.  It was dirty.  Yeah.  Fuzzy.  A lot of fuzzy video.  Yeah.  Not crystal clear.  And a song like Philadelphia Freedom.  Yeah.  That's a very 70s.  You picked the worst Elton John song.  That reminds me of my father, though.  That's who I listened to in the car.  But it does.  But it's like the bicentennial.  Yeah.  You know, it's like the 70s.  I remember driving to my grandmother's house.  You were driving in the 70s?  No, no, that was my mom was driving us. 
[00:55:00]  I didn't start driving until the 90s, Sam Roberts.  And hear that.  The 80s, baby.  And hear this in the backseat of the car, you know?  And you're driving around.  And, like, yeah, the bicentennial was coming up.  I love this song.  Very patriotic.  Yeah.  I used to be a rolling stone.  Yeah.  This sums up the 70s, kind of.  As far as, you know.  My face in a pillow for the night.  They're a terrible gay joke. 
[00:55:30]  Doesn't he say a barbrummer or something?  Some weird.  A barbrummel?  What is that?  I don't know.  I think it's a vagabond.  No, I have no idea.  Joe Ho, FF23 looks.  Oh, Joe Hoff, 23.  Sorry, with two Fs.  The 70s seem itchy with all the polyester and pubic hair.  That's pretty good.  A lot of pubes.  A lot of pubes.  That's pretty good, Joseph.  I like that one.  Every time I see a clip from the 70s where a woman is wearing, like, some kind of spandex or a dancey, pantsy thing, you can just look and see this giant bulge of a muff. 
[00:56:00]  The decade of the camel toe.  Yes.  Accentuated with that hair.  But my, um, it's like my, you know, like a lot of people, like I happen to have a new nickname.  What?  That's not what I was saying.  But you have to be entertaining on Twitter, but sometimes you just want people to know your new nickname.  What's your new nickname?  You didn't check his Twitter this morning. 
[00:56:30]  No, I didn't.  Oh, I don't know.  What is it?  Sprout.  Sprout?  Where did that come from?  Sprout.  I think you should call me Sprout.  Hey, Sprout.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Hello.  Yeah, I'm back. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, Bobo.  How you doing?  It's the Muslim Bobo.  It's Bobo Hamid.  Motherfucker, I was born and raised in Iraq.  You know what I mean?  I was holding guns way before Anthony.  Oh, shut up.  Sounds good.  Way before you Anthony.  Oh, shut up.  Why don't you stay there?  I love knowing that I got under your skin there, buddy.  Good luck to you.  Oh, my God.  It's Iraqi Bobo.  It really is.  It's been a while. 
[00:57:30]  I'm putting a jihad against you guys.  A jihad.  A right.  So, Boner, Boehner got re-elected as Speaker of the House.  He certainly did.  And this is all you need to know about politics.  This is why they're all so hateable.  Peter King did the right thing, yelling and screaming.  The master of McCall. 
[00:58:00]  And basically calling for his head.  Calling for Boehner's head.  Yes.  And then he turns around and votes for him to continue as Speaker of the House because  he pussied out.  Yes.  That's all you need to know about politics.  He did the right thing for the people of New York, basically saying, don't give any more  money to them or any of this shit.  And then when push comes to shove, the fucking guy votes Boehner back in.  Yep.  What a pussy Peter King is.  And if Boehner didn't need those votes, he never would have reversed that quickly.  No.  The timing of Peter and Chris Christie. 
[00:58:30]  Did Christie vote for him?  I don't know.  Does Christie even get a vote?  I don't know how that goes.  No, he doesn't get a vote.  He doesn't.  Okay.  He's a gabner.  All right.  Hey, gabner.  But the fact that they both bashed him came the day or two days before the vote on purpose.  Yeah.  And actually, that's when he did table it.  King destroyed him.  Peter King from New York.  He was all over the TV.  And then turns around.  He votes for the guy.  What's that about?  Politique.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  None of them mean a fucking word. 
[00:59:00]  He was brave, sort of, in the end.  Yeah.  Sort of.  Sprout says, none of them mean anything they say.  Sprout.  Hi.  Any backstory to Sprout or just your thought of it?  No.  Like, T-Bone!  Sprout.  Sometimes I'll just look at myself in the mirrors in the morning when I'm getting ready  and I'll just say, go get him, Sprout.  Aw.  Eat it.  It's adorable.  I hate it.  You don't like Sprout now. 
[00:59:30]  I hate Sprout as a name.  It doesn't make sense.  It's my nickname.  Oh, Sprout.  All right.  What do we got going on after the break?  We got to take a break here.  Like an eight-year-old is called.  Oh, yeah.  We got some things to talk about.  Quentin Tarantino's now mad.  Wow, man.  Why?  Some assholes bringing up movie violence in connection with Newton.  Oh, yuck.  Jesus.  To Tarantino.  Oh, who is?  Fucking Jackers.  Terry Gross asked him. 
[01:00:00]  Who's Terry Gross?  Terry Gross.  From NPR.  She interviews.  Oh, God.  Everybody.  And what did she ask him?  She asked him if movie violence was still as fun for him immediately following something like.  Do you know what would be a great question for him to ask, though?  When the media does that, that's a great opportunity to murder them.  Yes.  You could say that's an interesting question.  Is covering the news, does it still feel as good to get the scoop when you see little coffins going by? 
[01:00:30]  For you guys.  Let's talk on an equal basis.  When you're diving in for 24 hours a day showing this stuff, does that make you feel good?  Yeah.  Do your ratings feel as good when you've gotten them by showing a photo of a shooter or saying the name of a shooter,  even after profilers have told you you're encouraging other people to do that?  Does that feel good?  You answer that question, too.  Does it feel good interviewing the kids going back to school yesterday?  When management comes up to you, and they do, and show you ratings, that the ratings, we got a ratings bump and it went up, 
[01:01:00]  do you hang your head and go, ah, I just wish you, you know, ah, or do you go, yeah, nice, we're up in the ratings.  I made a bonus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you ever look at the fact that you made those ratings kind of on the backs of dead children?  Of dead children.  Yeah.  Does that bother you?  Well, we're going to find out what Quentin Tarantino did with that question.  I bet he didn't do that, though.  No, but he'd probably handle it.  He'd probably say, Terry Gross, what are you, disgusting or something?  Ah, yeah.  Chip Tarantino.  Sprout's hilarious. 
[01:01:30]  Sprout says, I wish people would just get along.  Aw.  Ellis from Philly does a podcast as well, and his is called Down Dirty Show.  Oh, his island is great.  At Down Dirty Show.  Huh?  His island is great.  I'm promoting a listener podcast today.  What the fuck?  Oh, yeah?  What the fuck?  So, we'll do the Tarantino audio next.  Leonardo DiCaprio's got something to say.  Oh, God.  He's a groveling idiot.  Oh.  And other things. 
[01:02:00]  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to say fuck you to my little dick, you asshole.  Stop pissing on my balls.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  His fuck you goes out to all you assholes with your outrageous stories on what you're trying to do.  I was trying to jerk off. 
[01:02:30]  I was trying to fuck my husband.  I was trying to fuck a hamster.  You were not.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to say fuck you to AIDS.  Because of you, you cocksucker, I have to make my dick look like a tiny bank robber whenever I want to sex up my woman.  Fuck you, AIDS.  Fuck you.  The ASFU goes out to Sam.  You need to shut the fuck up, dude.  Okay?  You don't make yourself look good by making everybody, trying to make everybody else look bad. 
[01:03:00]  You're an asshole.  I can't stand you.  You make me sick.  Always putting somebody else down to try to make yourself look good.  Shut the fuck up.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big F you to fucking Beer.  Fuck you, Beer.  I slept with a fat bitch last weekend, and now she's stalking me.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give that fucking sick cunt of a cop who just pulled me over for going five miles over the speed limit a big fuck you. 
[01:03:30]  So guess what, you sick?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to send a big F you out to fucking Sam for always saying, yeah, I mean, I just listened to the goddamn replay, and he fucking said, yeah, I mean, ten times within two minutes.  Holy fucking shit, dude.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You're cool, and fuck you. 
[01:04:00]  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F you line.  866-FU-LINE1.  That's 866-FU-LINE1.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  All I like to say is that my life is pretty plain. 
[01:04:30]  I like watching the bottles gather rain.  I believe this is like 20 years old.  Is it really?  I heard that somewhere.  Yesterday was one of those shows.  Yeah.  It was one of our silly shows.  It was fun.  It was fun.  I will acknowledge a lot of people hated yesterday's show. 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  But then you did have people that really enjoyed it.  I'm not trying to say that everyone did, certainly.  I would imagine it was maybe, maybe a 50-50 split.  You know what else we missed?  Colin Ferguson was 20 years ago.  Was it really?  93.  Yeah.  When he represented himself?  Yeah.  Colin Ferguson.  Because McCarthy there, his wife, who is now, what is she, a representative? 
[01:05:30]  Some bullshit.  That bitch.  Oh, Christine Quentin, right?  No, McCarthy.  Carolyn McCarthy.  Carolyn, right.  Oh, is that who that is?  Yeah, that's the wife.  Okay.  And boy, is she a gun control nut.  I don't blame her, though.  I do.  Even though she annoys me, her husband was murdered.  I do, because she's just...  And her son was fucked up.  Let's not forget.  She was in a tough spot there.  I do.  That's a reaction to a horrible thing.  Yeah.  But she's making it so other people can be put in that situation.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:06:00]  Colin Ferguson did not use a legal handgun.  He didn't use a legal gun.  I know.  He fucking went in there and killed her husband and maimed her son.  And she then goes off and tries to get people that might have been able to thwart his murder spree on the train so they can't have guns.  It makes no sense.  Oh, gee.  I don't know.  Oh, now, Sprout, just listen up.  I'll let her have her thing. 
[01:06:30]  That's her thing.  Her thing is fucking everyone up.  That's her thing.  She's going to make more murders on trains.  I don't think she's...  Dummy.  What has she accomplished?  She's going to make more murders on trains.  She's been at this 20 years.  She's been at this 20 years.  What has she accomplished?  Well, she was part of the first assault weapons ban and the Brady Bill.  And she is now trying to get high cap magazines outlawed and shit like that.  It doesn't do anything.  Whatever. 
[01:07:00]  Whatevs.  More importantly, I've got to tell Jim Norton that I saw the naked guy at the gym yesterday.  Oh, God.  The old guy now.  Yeah, this is Jimmy's thing.  Ooh.  Well, I've got to explain it.  It's Jimmy's thing, and he keeps asking me if I've seen this.  And now that I've seen it, yes, I've seen it.  Yeah.  Basically, there's a guy in our locker room that Jimmy has brought up a few times on the show  that hangs out completely naked and talks to the black guy that works the locker room at our gym. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Now, yesterday after the show, I went to the gym, and I walked into the locker room,  and there's the guy talking to the black guy completely clothed.  All right.  So he's dressed.  So I'm thinking, all right, I guess that's not the guy.  So I go to my locker.  I'm there maybe two minutes to put my workout clothes on,  and now I'm walking out of the locker room to go work out.  In the time I passed the guy, went to my locker, and then came back, 
[01:08:00]  it could have been more than two, maybe three minutes.  I walk now back toward the exit, and he's completely naked.  Come on.  He's fucking.  He's completely naked, and he's still talking to the black guy.  I'm like, how does that happen that I walk past him,  and he's completely clothed.  Two to three minutes later, I'm walking back, and he's down naked.  What happened?  In the middle of the conversation, did he say, hold on a minute, 
[01:08:30]  and then take all his clothes off?  Because it's not like he's next to his locker.  He's out in the open.  Holy shit.  So he just started taking his clothes off?  Oh, yeah.  He'll just stand there.  Yeah.  In front of the guy?  I don't know.  Absolutely.  Because there were no clothes on the floor.  So he's next to this, like, Jimmy knows.  There's a mirror outside his locker area,  and he was standing there with all his clothes on,  talking to the black guy.  I think they talk sports, right?  They always talk to the Knicks.  The Knicks, okay.  Always.  And then by the time I get my workout clothes on and head back, 
[01:09:00]  now he's in the same exact spot, completely naked.  He looks like a color form set, like you just pulled the clothes off.  He's hateable.  I don't think he's hateable.  It makes me laugh.  Now it's going to make me laugh every time I see it.  Because I think he's harmless,  but I hate the fact that he's roping us into his exhibition as unfetish.  Yeah.  And there's something different about not being.  He's a mess of the man, by the way,  just because, you know, we've got to paint the picture for everybody. 
[01:09:30]  He's bald.  He's terrible.  Mid-60s, upper-60s, just not a hint of a muscle on him.  Like a judge.  It's just massive, like, cubic hair.  Oh, God.  It's just fucking a small penis.  If you're not modest and in passing you're talking to somebody,  you know, not my thing, but that's one thing.  To hold an entire conversation while you're nude in a locker room is ridiculous.  But he was having the conversation with all his clothes on.  So I just need to know what happened in his brain where he's like, 
[01:10:00]  well, I would like to continue talking about the Knicks,  but I now need to be completely nude.  Maybe the black guy turns and goes,  get your fucking clothes off before you talk to me, motherfucker.  Get your fucking clothes off.  There's something there.  Okay.  There's a humiliation because he has such a tiny cock.  It's a tiny cock.  Does he have a little cock?  It's horrendous.  And there's something there where he likes being seen naked by this black guy.  Because a little old white cock. 
[01:10:30]  I bet it's, I bet.  You think it's a fetish thing or you think older guys just don't give a fuck?  I would think that, but it's too purposeful and it's too often.  And he's always nude.  But if he was just talking casually, like there's a guy next to me in my locker area who,  not the fucking, not the, what's the guy, I keep forgetting his name, not the Alan Arkin  guy, but another guy who babbles. 
[01:11:00]  But he's really nice.  But he just fucking yaps off the fiscal cliff.  And he'll get naked, but he'll get dressed again.  And I know that it's not a weird vibe.  Like I know he's just a guy who's not thinking and likes to talk.  But why would you ever have to take your underpants off?  Well, if he's going to the shower or whatever.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.  You don't have to take your underpants off.  If you go to the shower, you do.  I go home with.  When you get to the shower, you can take them off.  No, you put them in your locker.  I understand that.  But can't you just take them off while your towel's on? 
[01:11:30]  You can.  Or you can take them off quickly, I guess.  There's no need to be naked.  I go home with very soaked underpants.  Really?  Yes.  No, rushing them off under your towel is almost like I'm 12 and I'm worried someone's going  to see my wee wee.  There's a normalcy to it.  The only time I do that is when that fucking Alan Arkin guy is in the area.  It's not Alan Arkin, by the way.  Because we do have celebrities in our gym.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  Because people are going to start thinking it's actually Alan Arkin. 
[01:12:00]  No, not at all.  Which would be hilarious.  Yeah, I'd let them see my cock if it was Alan Arkin.  But no, this is just a guy who kind of looks like him.  But that guy I do with the towel wrapped around me because he annoys me.  But the guy that's naked in front of the black guy, he annoys you?  Yeah, I don't hate him.  That's just going to make me laugh.  Because he's a silly old man.  Because when I finally had the realization that I was the guy you're talking about, I couldn't  wait to text you.  I was going to tweet all about it yesterday.  Oh, he's awful.  His Oswald Cobblepot body. 
[01:12:30]  But like I said, I'll walk by, he has all his clothes on.  I'm like, all right, that can't be the guy, I guess.  And then by the time he turns around, he's naked.  He'll just walk around and gesture totally nude.  Such an asshole, that guy.  I love that it bothers you.  Well, but it's not like he's some young predator guy.  It doesn't bother me like that.  It's just he's roping us all.  You know what he's doing, I guess.  Yeah, and it is more silly than it is.  Like, I don't get truly angry about it.  He has gotten you. 
[01:13:00]  He's like gotten you.  Yeah.  You're fucking, now you're talking about him being naked.  You know he's naked.  That's right.  I'm going to listen to his podcast.  The Naked Old Man podcast.  I think it was DePaulo who said that.  I feel like my nose is full of Triscuits.  Triscuits.  I'm dry.  Nick's references are fucking masterful.  But that naked guy, it's like, you know, ah, gee, put on your clothes, mister. 
[01:13:30]  Poor Sprout doesn't have to see that.  Sprout's a TV network, too, you know, for little kids.  I didn't know that.  Sam Maria's fucking into Sprout.  It's weird.  I was watching Care Bears last night.  What?  Sure.  I never thought my life would be sitting in bed with my kid watching Care Bears.  Oh, man.  You know, you gotta.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Did he like it?  Yeah, at least it's not Caillou.  Caillou.  Or they say Caillou. 
[01:14:00]  There's some weird pronunciation there.  Caillou.  That's a stupid song.  Caillou.  Did you see the viral video of fucking Woody yet?  Woody?  Yeah, I'm obsessed with a viral video.  When I see the simplest video, getting millions of views, it drives me insane.  Do you know Toy Story?  Oh, of course.  Do you know when he's hanging on to the bumper?  Yeah.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, someone decided to make a video where they have Woody just hanging on to the bumper 
[01:14:30]  as they're flying down the highway.  And that's all it took for this guy to go viral.  How is that?  He got a Woody doll.  Oh, he got a Woody doll.  And it's just hanging on to the back of his bumper.  I thought you meant the actual clip.  And then someone driving by actually videoed it.  And he's the one that got the viral video.  The simplest thing.  You know, you just never know.  For all the parents that have kids, that's something they would love to click on.  You could go to the fucking Apple store.  This is all it is.  How many views does it have? 
[01:15:00]  I don't know.  Go to the YouTube version.  Let me see, Sammy.  It was from June.  Oh, my God.  One million.  And they got the music.  Look at all this.  Are those balls hanging on the back?  That's all the video is.  It's what?  15 seconds.  Why do I even try?  1.7 million views.  Holy shit.  It's called Hang On Woody for the parents out there. 
[01:15:30]  It looks pretty good.  Yeah, it looks.  I mean, it looks like.  Because the legs are flopping.  Yeah, the legs are flopping around.  That's pretty good.  The opsters got to go back to the drawing board.  Man.  Sometimes it's, you know, it's the simplest thing.  That has no.  How many dislikes and likes does that have?  It's got 13,000 likes and 67 dislikes.  People love that fucking video.  Internet assholes that have to dislike everything.  But how, uh, oh, yes.  Before we don't have to talk about it now. 
[01:16:00]  What?  The Mimi Beardsley was on.  Oh, yeah, she was.  Was it good?  I only watched a couple of moments of clips.  Her legs look good.  I saw on the Today Show.  Oh, my God.  Is she 60-something?  Her fucking, I just don't know why I just thought of that.  Yeah.  Her fucking legs look good, man.  And to Mimi Beardsley?  No, but I understand.  But fucking 40 years ago.  Oh, she must have been nuts.  She was sitting.  I couldn't see her.  Well, the knees give it away.  She must have been nuts.  But she doesn't look as bad as you think at her age.  Yeah, what'd you do?  Yes, I'd eat her pussy.  Just because Jack was in there. 
[01:16:30]  In a second.  For the story.  Yeah.  There's only one woman alive you can fuck to say,  I fucked the same girl as JFK that we know about.  Oh.  And that we know about.  Is that it?  Really?  All the other ones are dead?  Who else is there?  She was 19.  Wow.  I want her in.  She's still doing press.  Oh, no, that was the Elvis Brut.  It would be fun to have her in and play the song for her.  The one from Taxi Driver was with Elvis.  Forgot her fucking name.  Taxi Driver was Jodie Foster. 
[01:17:00]  The blonde.  The older blonde.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, you do.  Fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm waiting.  She brags that she was with Elvis.  Ah.  She's still alive.  Sybil Shepard.  Oh, Elvis maybe, but not JFK.  No, I said Elvis.  Oh, okay.  I said Elvis.  But Kennedy, I think, because he was killed in 63.  There's so few.  Can you find a video of her on Mimi Beardsley on MSNBC or whatever?  She'd have to be old bags now.  She didn't look bad, though.  How about...  Was she on ABC?  She was, or she was on a few different shows, I think. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Yeah, she was on NBC last night.  I really want to interview her, though.  Why can't we?  I don't know.  I'd give her a real interview.  I read most of the book.  Yeah.  She was talking about how she had a pregnancy scare at one point.  Fuck.  Wow.  That would have been fun.  And they're like, what did you do?  And she's like, well, I offered to help me take it care of.  Abortion?  Oh, yeah, of course.  But he's Catholic.  He was Catholic.  Oh.  Against the church.  What are you doing at the computer?  Stop.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Stop breaking it. 
[01:18:00]  What do you got, Travis?  The interview that was on last night was just a rebroadcast from the one that was on last  year.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Which we kind of did, right?  Yeah, we played the audio and all that.  All right.  So we're good there.  Do we play the video?  Yeah.  What we need to do is find the promo for Pete Rose's new reality show.  Yes.  Ant was telling me about it.  Yeah, yeah.  He's 71 and he's got Asian broad, Japanese broad.  Yep.  What kind of Asian broad?  I don't know.  Could you?  Oh, God.  There's fucking mics.  Is he back in baseball now?  He is, right?  Hell no.  Oh, he's not?  Hell no. 
[01:18:30]  They're never going to let Pete Rose do that.  Is he in the Hall of Fame or no?  Hell no.  He sets up a card table down the street every year.  Pete Rose rocks.  He's, yeah, he's out.  He fucking rocks.  He sets up his card table around baseball.  Do you think he'll get in after he dies?  That's such a weird...  I don't know.  Because of the people that are in baseball, stop making believe baseball is this pure sport.  Oh, yeah.  It's very...  The shit that we have learned the last 10 years alone, you let Pete Rose in. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Yeah, I agree.  You've got so many players popping each other in the hiney with fucking needles.  Ooh.  And you're still holding a grudge with Pete Rose?  Get the fuck out of here.  Well, he's got a reality show now.  He's with some broad with big fake tits.  She's 30.  She's 30?  And he's 71.  He's 71?  And the show, I think, is called Hits and Misses, right?  MRS.  Get it?  Oh, God. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, no.  But you know you're going to watch.  They must have been brainstorming for a while to try to get some baseball woman angle there.  You know?  Yeah.  The wife and the husband.  Is that his kids?  Mm-hmm.  Wait, is that her kid?  Or his?  Let's watch the preview.  All right.  All right, Sam.  That's pretty funny, though, that he went with an Asian woman like that so him and his son  could have the same haircut.  Oh, gee.  I want to have a catch, too.  That's Sprout.  I've had enough of Sprout already. 
[01:20:00]  Let's look at the promo.  For Hits and Misses.  That's where he wants to end up.  How come you're not in the Hall of Fame?  I want him to have a meeting with the commissioner.  I'd have bet my life he was going to reinstate me.  He's got to fight for it.  I'm going to bring you up to surgery in just a minute.  You're getting married.  When is the date?  When are you guys going to get married?  2029?  Everybody wants a date.  Let me handle what's going on here.  I get along with Pete's kids very well.  He gets unhappy.  We might kill you.  I didn't think they would look like in a dress. 
[01:20:30]  What kind of dress?  She's hot.  That's all they give us?  I've seen different ones.  She's attractive.  I've seen other promos.  It's going to be on TLC.  Nice.  Of course.  Everything's on TLC.  She is hot.  All these freak shows now.  She's definitely hot.  I'll watch that.  TLC used to be the learning channel.  Remember?  We really love TLC.  Now it's fucking honey boo boo.  Here's another promo.  All right.  No?  It's the same one.  Oh.  I saw another one last night.  Did you really? 
[01:21:00]  I swear to God.  Hope to die.  Stick a needle in my eye.  Ow!  When is that show on?  Oh, Sprout.  Gee, I hate needles, Ant.  So do I.  A little guy.  I don't like them.  When's the show on there, Sam?  14th.  Oh.  Next week?  Two weeks, I think.  10 days?  10 days from today?  Two weeks.  Yeah.  I saw one clip where they said, she goes, oh, look, it's the felons and melons. 
[01:21:30]  She points to him and goes, it's felons and melons.  But he's a felon.  I know.  It didn't make sense to me either.  Oh, okay.  No.  I guess they couldn't say felon and melon unless he was married to him.  Exactly.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  If.  All right.  Felon and melon would be Natalie Wood and...  Another one.  Of course. 
[01:22:00]  Ooh, melon.  So, Quentin Tarantino.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  He was on NPR with Terry Gross?  Yeah.  That's funny.  Terry Gross, guy, girl.  She's a lady.  She does all the...  She does a ton of...  I don't know Terry Gross.  Didn't her and Gene Simmons get into it?  Yep.  Oh, she...  I do know Terry Gross.  Yep.  Gene Simmons does not like Terry Gross.  What'd they get into it about?  She used to...  Yeah.  Sexism.  Oh, okay.  You know.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[01:22:30]  Why would you...  Why would you say that?  So Tarantino gets annoyed with Terry Gross.  They're so...  These people are so easy to run around.  These dumb media questions.  They're so easy to make that question your platform to smash them.  I just have to ask you, um...  Is it any less fun after, like, the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary?  Like, do you ever go through a period where you lose your taste for movie violence? 
[01:23:00]  And movie violence is not real violence.  I understand the difference.  But still...  Then why are you asking?  Then why are you asking?  If you understand the difference, there's zero tie-in.  You're only doing that to somehow shoehorn Sandy Hook into the discussion.  Right.  You fraud.  Not real violence.  I understand the difference.  But still, are there times when it's... 
[01:23:30]  It just is not a fun movie experience for you.  Either to be...  Oh, my God.  Just fucking stop it.  You know why?  Because she knows on some level that it's a bullshit question.  Yes.  It's trying...  It's bullshit.  She's trying to give legitimacy.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, for instance, if somebody was shot and the shooter was wearing a Django hat, yell,  Django!  She would have said, there was a murder associated with your film.  Does that make it hard? 
[01:24:00]  It would have been a very simple question.  Yes.  But there's zero tie-in, and she knows it.  Trying to tie in something that doesn't have a tie-in.  Is she the oldest progeria kid?  It's Andy Dick.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow, that's rough.  That's rough.  Mm-hmm.  ...be experience for you.  Either to be making it that way or to be in the audience for something like that.  Not for me.  So, it's so completely separate that the...  Ah! 
[01:24:30]  Good.  Not for me.  Sandy Hook.  What a terrible interview question.  How desperate are you to tie something in or to make your agenda...  Right.  ...and blame something?  Again, why don't you talk about your part in it as a member of the media?  Right.  It's not as easy as blaming violent video games and movie violence, you idiot.  And you work for NPR.  You should know a little more than the average broadcaster.  Absolutely.  So, it's so completely separate that the reality of violence doesn't affect at all your feelings 
[01:25:00]  about making or viewing very violent or sadistic.  Sadistic?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You're putting a judgment on it.  No, no, no.  You're putting a judgment on it.  You're putting a judgment on it.  The characters are sadistic.  The characters are sadistic.  I'm not talking about, you know, the filmmaker.  I'm talking about the characters.  I mean, the characters are undeniably sadistic.  Oh, shit.  But, when you say after the tragedy, what do you mean by that exactly? 
[01:25:30]  Well, like...  Do you mean on that day would I watch the Wild Bunch?  Maybe not on that day.  Or in the next few days.  Like, while it's still really fresh in your...  While the reality...  Would I watch a Kung Fu movie three days after the Sandy Hook Massacre?  Would I watch a Kung Fu movie?  Maybe, because they have nothing to do with each other. 
[01:26:00]  You sound annoyed that I'm...  She's awful.  I know you've been asked this a lot.  She's awful.  I'm really annoyed.  I think it's disrespectful.  I think it's disrespectful to their memory, actually.  Which...  Whose memory?  The memory of the people who died, to talk about movies.  I think it's totally disrespectful to their memory.  Obviously, the issue is gun control and mental health.  What?  She's terrible.  That's where it ended?  Wow.  Or is there more to it?  Nah, she moved on. 
[01:26:30]  Because she stings.  She couldn't get what she wanted.  No, she was trying to get some kind of fucking...  What was she trying to get?  I have no idea.  She's terrible.  Even what she was trying for there.  What a dog shit, cheese dick question.  It is.  NPR is the most overrated fucking media outlet ever.  The cabbies love it.  They do.  The cabbies love NPR and it's so boring.  Boring and overrated.  The whole delivery is a snooze fest. 
[01:27:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, there's supposed to be some legitimacy to NPR radio.  They fired Juan Williams, right?  On Fox now?  Yeah.  Because...  Why don't they fire them all then?  Fucking call me.  You throw me right off track, you cocksucker.  Fucking double questions.  She gets 4.5 million people listening to her every week.  Jesus. 
[01:27:30]  4.5 million.  We don't even have a taste of that.  Lulled to sleep.  Yeah, a lot of that's just background noise.  It's not everywhere.  That's what it is.  Yeah, that's passive radio.  She's seen as an insightful interviewer by dummies.  And maybe she isn't.  I've never heard of full interviews she's done.  But just by that, it's embarrassingly obvious and bad what she's doing.  But she doesn't believe that.  I hope not.  For her sake.  She pretty much said it as she asked the question.  She doesn't believe that.  So why don't you discuss that? 
[01:28:00]  Why you don't believe that?  And then he would certainly give you some stuff.  He's very, very intelligent.  Is it any less satisfying for her to see a car chase in a movie after a drunk driving accident?  Shut the fuck up.  They're not connected.  I don't think so.  Would you still watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest after seeing that?  Right.  Mental illness?  Right.  Of course I would.  Disconnected, you dope.  Ah, gee.  Speaking of DiJango. 
[01:28:30]  DiJango.  I pronounced the D.  You got it.  You got it, right?  Leonardo DiCaprio talks about how difficult it was the first day in the set.  Colin had pointed this out to me.  And I hadn't seen any of the interviews.  And I've seen print.  And now I said, shut up, Leo.  You don't believe him?  I believe that he believes it.  Really?  But who gives a fuck?  What does he play in the movie?  A very nasty slave owner who says nigger a lot, who bets on slaves. 
[01:29:00]  He's a brutal guy.  Does he say it the most in the movie?  He might.  Probably based on screen time, I would say so.  But the fact that he is going out of...  And again, this was a point Carl made that he was right about.  The fact that he's going out of his way to constantly talk about how bad the character is.  Shut the fuck up.  Now it's annoying.  He was great in it.  Shut up.  Gotcha.  You don't need to say he was reprehensible. 
[01:29:30]  He was a slave owner.  Right.  He was brutal.  That's it.  He's just a character.  You're a character.  He's probably worried people are thinking that's how he actually is.  And that and that...  You're right.  And that's what makes him fucking hateable.  Play the fucking role, man.  Relax.  We even asked...  I've asked it a few times of directors and actors and stuff.  What...  If it's uncomfortable having to blurt out racial epithets in front of another actor and a person of color. 
[01:30:00]  And a lot of them are like, no, you know, it's the part.  And then they go on and talk about how difficult it was.  What the fuck?  You kind of think it's difficult.  Probably.  Because you would think the other actors looking at you like, I'm going to know if you need it.  He's a little comfortable saying that.  Yeah, exactly.  He's either a really good actor or he really means that.  Samuel Jackson telling that guy to say nigger in that interview.  Like, because he was calling out that phony question.  Yes.  That fucking detached, smarmy interviewer question. 
[01:30:30]  The N-word.  The N-word.  The insincerity of that.  Yeah, say it.  We had him on once.  Oh, yeah.  On the phone, man.  I forgot that was a big day.  Here's DiCaprio.  DiCaprio plays the truly despicable Kelvin Candy.  We got a supply going on that's a good bit of fun.  Plantation owner and all-round bad guy who uses the N-word repeatedly.  Why is that in the description? 
[01:31:00]  You fucking child lady.  You grown-up child baby.  Child lady.  Child lady.  Who uses the N-word a lot.  The N-word.  The N-word.  This fucking country.  We are just a society of fucking little baby children.  Little booty baby children.  He uses the N-word.  We're a country of sprouts.  It's all a bunch of sprouts.  How embarrassing is it to watch grown people, whether it's on the news or TV, saying the N-word like children. 
[01:31:30]  Him use bad language.  He said nigger because he played a slave owner.  Right.  You dummy.  And that's what they said.  Holy shit.  If you say he portrays a slave owner who gambled on slaves brutally fighting to the death, in that sentence is the word despicable.  You don't need to sum it up and fucking editorialize it. 
[01:32:00]  We get what that is.  Fuck.  Is it phony outrage, you think?  It's phony compassion.  It's phony editorializing.  Shut the fuck up.  It's a role.  He played a slave owner.  Slave owner said nigger.  Stop explaining yourself.  It's embarrassing.  They said it.  And the way she's going about it.  Yeah.  But that's how they do it.  Bad guy who uses the N-word repeatedly.  I got to say, the first day on set was incredibly difficult for me. 
[01:32:30]  Can I speak on that?  I'll speak on that.  Okay.  Well, let him speak on it.  I know, but I have to tell you because I watched it.  I watched.  Yeah.  And he goes, he said, buddy.  And I said, what's the deal?  He said, it's tough.  I said, you know what?  You're human.  It's supposed to be tough.  Oh, stop it.  You're not supposed to feel like that's normal in 2012, 2013.  Really?  Have a talk of a storm for black people.  Hey, MF, get over that. 
[01:33:00]  It's just another Tuesday for us.  And let's get going.  The language is hard for us as actors to say.  And some of the things that my character does are obviously atrocious.  Oh, shut up.  But, you know, they both sat me down.  Sam Jackson.  We were lost.  Oh, the black people sat me down.  I don't think that happened.  The black people sat me down.  You think Samuel L. Jackson sat him down?  And said, relax and do it.  Yeah, because I bet you that he did do that fucking phony actor sheepish thing where he said, 
[01:33:30]  oh, this is tough, Jamie.  And Jamie was probably like, just do it.  I'm tired of the phoniness.  Holy fucking shit.  That whole world out there is sickening.  Yes.  They both sat me down, Sam Jackson.  We were all sitting around the table.  If you don't take this character to the utter extreme, if you don't speak the truth about  the way we were treated at that time, you know, people are going to think this is sugar  coated, that you're not telling the truth.  Why would they have to say that to you when you are in the biggest film of all time or the 
[01:34:00]  second biggest film of all time?  Why do you need to be told that?  Why the shucks routine?  You're an actor.  Shut up.  You read the script.  You know the guy's despicable.  Play it as despicable.  Or don't take it.  Or don't take the role.  You don't need two black people to sit you down.  Very privileged black people who know nary a fucking second of the slave lifestyle to  tell you what. 
[01:34:30]  Stop.  I'm annoyed with this.  But they don't.  But they just did it.  They said, you know, I mean, they're like, just do your thing.  It was probably annoying for them because they see that phone.  I bet Sam Jackson might have.  But that fucking Jamie Foxx, he's another fucking piece of shit.  You don't like Jamie?  No.  I've had it with him.  Self-important douche he is.  What did he do recently?  Ah, fuck him.  What did he do?  What did he do?  No, I didn't even like what he said there.  Oh, that was Jamie and that was Jamie Foxx.  He was explaining what he just said to DiCaprio. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  I didn't even know Jamie Foxx was in the movie.  I haven't seen the movie yet.  It's good, man.  He's Django.  Yeah, he's Django.  He's Django.  Good for him.  The Jamie Foxx.  You haven't seen a trailer?  Not really.  I got two kids.  Can you imagine the fucking, the Roots cast?  Like, it has, I mean, do they, do we always have to, now it's, we have to apologize  for what they say, we say as actors or fucking, shut the fuck up.  Fucking shut up.  Yeah, stop.  Stop already.  It's like, I know what you guys do is fake. 
[01:35:30]  You're pretending to be other people.  Don't worry about it.  We all know that.  Tarantino at least handles it with disdain for the dumb motherfuckers asking the questions.  How much do you love him?  I love him.  God.  You know what the phoniness is, too?  There's a reality behind the word nigger that people don't want to fucking even address  or realize.  People say, I never think it.  I never use it.  I never fucking imagine it.  It doesn't work in my existence.  If somebody does something to you that is horrible, you're going to at least want to 
[01:36:00]  express it in the worst possible way you can.  So if somebody fucks with you, you instantly want to say something about that person.  That's the worst possible thing you can say.  The most hurtful thing.  Right.  So if a black person does something to you or says something or just you're in a confrontation,  you're not going to hold back one click.  I'm so angry.  But you know what?  I'm going to go to nine because 10 means bah. 
[01:36:30]  No, you go to 10.  You're a human being.  Why are we so phony?  And whenever it depends, a lot of times it's if you don't know the person because you don't  know enough about them to get like if I get angry at Keith Robinson or not argue it.  Right.  Okay.  Exactly.  I don't think that because I have a relationship with them.  So there's so many personal things that I get mad at.  Like you're fucking Keith, you fucking stubborn cunt.  Right.  Like that's what I think of. 
[01:37:00]  You fucking go.  Drunken.  Bingo.  Shut up.  Like it doesn't go to that because.  Yes.  But you know, it doesn't go there because you know it's the atom bomb.  That would.  But you know.  I don't even think.  That might end your relationship.  But it doesn't even conjure up.  You're right.  It's not where it comes.  It doesn't.  I don't even think of it.  But stranger to stranger, like if someone fucks with you on there, you just go, ah, you  fat, bald fuck or something.  You're like, yes, somebody cuts you off and you look in the car and you're like, oh, you  old bag, you fucking back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shit like that.  But if you don't know somebody and he's a black guy and he does something to you, you fucking 
[01:37:30]  at least think it.  Don't tell me you never think it.  I think that's important because if you don't know the person, you absolutely go to 10.  But if you have anything in the back of your head, like, well, in the end, I do still  want to have a relationship with this person.  You're not going to 10.  But I mean, you're going to go to nine, eight or nine.  I mean, I don't even think it when it's like with Keith.  Because do you not think it because, you know, it'll hurt him or, you know, it'll take it  to a level that you're not going to come back from because I mean, I wouldn't say it 
[01:38:00]  for that reason, but it's like when I'm mad at him or I'm annoyed at Keith or somebody  I know it's it's it's the randomness of finding the thing that would hurt him the most.  I know enough about him where it's a personal thing or it's his behavior or it's fucking.  I know that he's fucking digs in and you literally do more damage by knowing someone and getting  at them for more personally than than just using an epithet.  Right.  You could say, like you said, you fucking drunk or you maniac, you psychopath, you whatever. 
[01:38:30]  It's more personal.  But when you don't know, you know, they're being an asshole in the moment.  Yeah.  If a guy cuts you off, you don't know anything like the Adam bomb might be to that guy,  even though he's black, it might not be fucking screaming a racial thing at him.  Right.  It might be.  Might be.  Hey, one leg.  Yeah.  You don't know he's got one leg.  He's driving a car.  But but that's exactly it.  Hey, a daughter is retarded or hey, like you don't know the Adam bomb changes with different 
[01:39:00]  people.  Exactly.  But in that moment where you're a stranger and you're having a confrontation for that  moment, you throw that out.  The Adam bomb is the most obvious thing.  Of course, no one's going to hold back based on what or their thoughts.  At least they won't hold back.  No, you'll hold back on what you say.  But yeah, you might not yell it out.  But in your thoughts, you're going to be going to say it.  Stop.  I hate the phoniness.  It's just terrible.  And they'll call us honkies. 
[01:39:30]  I've heard that.  I don't like that at all.  It kind of hurts.  The H word kind of hurts.  The H word kind of hurts a little bit.  But you know what?  We've kind of brought this on ourselves by punishing people for being honest.  We've brought this phoniness on ourselves because if DiCaprio, if they said to him, was  it hard to say nigger?  If he said, no, not at all.  I'm an actor.  No, it's easy.  I'm an actor.  Right.  The headline would be DiCaprio had no trouble with N word.  Yes.  So it's easy to kill him for it.  But we've kind of taught people, tell the truth and we'll fucking burn you with it. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  The whole subject is fucked up because they had mentioned a little earlier.  They're, you know, the Utes out there pepper their language with the word.  Yeah.  Like it's nothing.  That's something.  If it's such a...  It's so strange to me.  If it's such a bad, horrible word...  It's argument's been done to death.  No, I know.  But it's true.  If it's so bad...  They pepper their conversation.  I can't walk around Manhattan without hearing it a lot.  You hear it all the time.  Especially the younger generation, man.  Yeah.  Anyone under 30, especially, every other word. 
[01:40:30]  It really is astounding that it's such a bad word.  It can't even be said.  You can only use the first letter when you're describing it.  Even in context.  It's so bad.  Then go out on the street, especially amongst the young black guys.  You're just...  That's all you're hearing.  Yeah.  It's all you're hearing.  So how fucking bad could it really be?  It's phony.  Is it so bad that you can only say the first fucking letter of it?  Well, they say it's slightly different.  I guess that's what makes it okay. 
[01:41:00]  Eh, not at all.  No, I know.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  It sounds ridiculous to me.  Yeah.  Profan...  If they're treating...  I just like to see us all as equals, believe it or not.  And, you know, it should be bad for everybody then.  If they're treating you as profanity...  That's where you lose me.  Yeah.  You can't say fuck on regular radio.  Right.  No matter who you are as a broadcaster.  You can't say cunt or cocksucker.  If it's going to be one of those words, then everyone has the same rules with language.  I mean, stop it.  Society has decided that it's only bad when a white person says it. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  That is a fact.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is a fact.  And I don't see it that way.  Based on some fucking hundreds of years old shit.  I understand.  And then it's almost like they're rubbing it in your face when they pepper their language.  I mean, geez.  Look what I could do.  Yeah.  I'd love to have a special word.  You do.  It rhymes with malcoholic.  For the discussion, Samuel Jackson did go to a segregated school when he was little, 
[01:42:00]  so in a way he could relate.  Yeah.  He wasn't always like rich and famous.  He's in his 60s, Sam Jackson.  He's not here on a while.  I'm just saying they weren't slaves, okay?  That's what I'm saying.  Let's get...  I like when people put everything in the same category.  They put the racial problems of the 60s and 50s in the same category as slavery.  It's like, well, you weren't a slave.  Ah, well, I had to grow up during segregation.  All right, look.  Can we at least make it a barrier there? 
[01:42:30]  We know how bad both of those were, but come on.  Look, I had to...  Let's be honest.  I had to grow up with margarine and sugar sandwiches.  I got problems.  Let's go to Joe in Alabama.  Black guy for the discussion.  Joe, what's up?  Alabama male.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Joe.  What's up, Joe?  I wanted to agree with Ant, believe it or not.  Ooh.  Because I just...  You know, I just listened to y'all's discussion.  I realized a lot of times we get mad and don't even know why we get mad.  We get mad because that's just what we're supposed to do. 
[01:43:00]  And we can have white friends that close to that, you know, that grew up with us.  They say nigga all the time.  I hear y'all say it on the radio, and it's funny as hell.  I don't get mad or offended.  But for some reason, if the average, just the average white man that you don't know  say it, then everybody's going to jump on it.  And my question is, why when the next person can say it and we don't get mad?  Even if we're talking about white friends, you can say it and we don't get mad.  We can listen to them already.  You don't laugh at it.  Hold on.  This guy reminded me.  I want to tape First 48 tonight. 
[01:43:30]  Let me...  Oh, and...  I'm going to pop it in my...  Oh, and...  What?  I got to pop it on my DVR.  You got an opportunity here, sir.  I got it here.  You got an opportunity.  All right.  No, it's all done.  Okay.  No, I hear what you're saying.  It's the strange...  Like your friends, you don't care what they say, right?  Oh, no.  It don't bother me at all.  Yes.  Exactly.  There's an underlying phoniness.  Phoniness.  That's what I hate.  By the way, if Samuel L. Jackson asked us to say the word, we'd say it.  Oh, man.  He'd have to ask us to stop. 
[01:44:00]  I only wanted it once, fellas.  All right.  You made your point.  Honestly, also, I don't use that exclusively for black people, by the way.  If I'm driving home, it's a fucking bad word.  It is.  It's given...  It's a bad word.  It's like any other bad word.  So if somebody does something to me, and they're white, I'll even look and fucking yell that out at them.  I don't give a shit.  It's a good, bad word to use.  You really love that word.  It's amazing. 
[01:44:30]  You're not making your case.  What you're saying is, to you, that word is so appealing, you can't even wait for a black guy to use it.  I have to use it on white people.  Yeah, why wait when I could use it now?  Why wait?  I asked for it in my eggs when I'm ordering an omelet.  Hey, I want to play the Samuel L. Jackson clip.  Thank you for the call, sir.  That we've referenced a few times here.  You got that, E-Rock.  Bye, Joe.  The one from yesterday.  Anyone?  E.  It's on the table.  It should be in there. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, hey, it's on the table.  It should be in there.  Funny yourself, motherfucker.  That's pretty much what E-Rock just said.  E-Rock, comment.  How am I supposed to go to the table?  Hang on, I'm seeing if it's on here.  It's on the table.  Can we just get it?  As E-Rock said, just deal with it, O.  Relax.  Relax.  That's what E-Rock says.  Well, we referenced it a few times, and maybe people didn't hear it when we played it yesterday.  Ah, in between all that list shit we were doing.  That lists.  Lists. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, boy.  Here it is.  Hey, there it is.  I love this clip.  Yeah, it is a good one.  I really love this clip.  This is a goodie.  This asshole got spanked in front of everybody.  There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the usage of the N-word in this movie.  No, nobody.  Now, let me ask you this.  I was so good.  Why didn't the guy...  Oh, should we play it first?  Yeah.  All right, because I got a question.  All right.  But let's play it out first.  Sorry.  There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the usage of the N-word in this movie. 
[01:46:00]  No, nobody.  None.  The word would be...  Oh, I don't want to say it.  Why not?  I don't like to say it.  Have you ever said it?  No, sir.  Oh, stop it.  Try it.  Really?  Seriously?  We're not going to have this conversation unless you say it.  You want to move on to another question?  Okay.  Awesome.  I don't want to say it.  Oh, come on.  Will you say it?  No, fuck no.  It's not the same thing. 
[01:46:30]  That's right.  Why do you want me to say it?  They're going to bleep it when you say it on your shelf.  Say it.  I can't say it.  If I say it, this question won't make air.  Okay, forget it.  Okay, I'll skip it.  Sorry, guys.  It was a good question.  No, it wasn't.  It was a great question.  It was a great question if you can't say it.  Good for fucking Samuel Jackson.  Let me start.  I love it.  I would probably take, I would probably go about his way, believe it or not.  I would probably say Samuel Jackson.  I would probably say Enmore.  But then if he told me to say it, I absolutely would say it. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Maybe out of a weird little respect, I would go about it that way.  But then if he called me out, I would have to say it.  So why isn't this guy saying it, is my question.  He's so scared shit of everything.  Is he scared of him?  Is he scared of his bosses?  He's scared of his job, his bosses?  Or is he scared of Samuel Jackson and how he would react?  Both.  You think it's both?  Yes.  It's everything.  You think it's both?  That word has gotten built up to this point where white people, you can hear it in his voice.  They're petrified of it. 
[01:47:30]  Petrified.  It's a jaw bender.  It's a fucking punch, get punched in the mouth fucking thing.  It's everything.  It's an amazing word.  It's magical.  It's like abra-fucking-cadabra.  In a weird way, out of respect, I would probably ask the question the same way.  But as soon as he asked me, okay, then I'll say it.  He was worried, too, that he was being set up.  Like, you're all so scared that if he said nigger, that Samuel Jackson would be like,  Man, you actually said it!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you, right?  What the fuck are you doing? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  And he probably pictured the YouTube clip of a remix of him just saying it over and over again and losing his job.  Yeah.  I don't...  He's a pussy-ass motherfucker, but I don't blame him.  Right, right.  Totally, because look at what we built it.  A guy doesn't just come out and act like that over a word.  That takes fucking years of programming.  That motherfucker is petrified.  Yeah.  Petrified.  Oh, that's a great clip.  It really is.  Sam Jackson's great.  No? 
[01:48:30]  Nobody?  No one?  What word?  Say it!  Say it, nigga, one more time!  We might have to do that.  Right?  No, I don't want to say it.  You might have to rework that scene.  See how it sounds.  All right, we'll break.  Adam Farrar's coming in today, a little later.  Yes, he is.  I think he's playing that great club, Levity.  Levity Live, right?  Levity Live!  In the Palisades.  Mall. 
[01:49:00]  In West Nyack, New York.  West Nyack.  Is that close to you?  Yeah, it's about 20 minutes from me.  It's kind of close.  Best Nyack?  Uh, I think it is technically still Best Chester.  It's part of the Best Chester, huh?  Technically.  Ah, gee, Chester's dandy.  Oh, Sprout.  It's West Chester.  The place is not Chester.  Somewhere in the Middle East, a murderous crime ring is about to trigger an international  crisis.  Who can the world turn to to face this nightmare head-on? 
[01:49:30]  Two of the world's most notorious mercenaries team up to face this never-ending catastrophe.  If only they could stop arguing.  Are you professional or not?  Suck my tennis cup!  He's an international superstar with an overblown ego and a really short fuse.  What don't you fucking understand?  Give me your fucking answer!  He's a drug-addicted, alcoholic, incontinent, bankrupt former wrestler with blown-out knees 
[01:50:00]  and a ten-inch penis.  Stop fighting it, man!  If they can get along, they might just manage to save the world.  Think for one fucking second!  Keep your fucking monster!  Christian Bale.  I'm gonna fucking kick your fucking ass!  You don't shut up for a second, all right?  The Iron Sheik.  That son of a bitch!  This summer, one gets pissed off. 
[01:50:30]  No!  Really easily.  No!  The other pees all over himself.  Fuck a fucking bitch, pussy!  Pissed on and pissed off.  Coming this summer.  The History Channel and Jimmy Dean Sausage Links with a grant from the Picket Fence Dental  Corporation present 20th Century American History with renowned scholar and member of Mensa,  Rich Voss.  I know a lot about it.  Dr. Voss will take you on a breathtaking journey through history's most poignant milestones. 
[01:51:00]  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962?  The Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  With every outburst, Rich Voss gets dumber and dumber.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when...  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  Your head will spin.  Who was the U.S. president when World War II ended?  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs. 
[01:51:30]  That didn't actually end World War II.  You've never met a Jew who knows less about World War II than Rich Voss.  What was the World War where Germany was going and taking, you know, just out of control?  By the way, I've never wanted to punch someone more than you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes.  It's pretty embarrassing when you think about it.  So tune in to 20th century American history and watch an amazement as an old Jewish man  goes from mildly coherent to babbling pile of mush in the course of an hour. 
[01:52:00]  You know, you know, it's all history from there.  Coming to the History Channel.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah, this is the O'P and Anthony Show.  Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God.  I don't know, but today seems kind of odd.  No barking from the dog.  No small.  And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog.  I got my grub on, but didn't dig out. 
[01:52:30]  Finally got a call from a girl I want to dig out.  How old is this?  I'm not sure.  Believe it or not, it's 20 years old.  20 years old.  I never would have known that.  What happened?  Is this NWA or Ice Cube?  I think it's just Ice Cube.  Okay.  Ice Cube!  Yeah!  What list are we doing today?  We're not doing a list today.  We're not doing a list today?  I don't think so.  Damn it!  It was a good day.  I like Ice Cube. 
[01:53:00]  I like his raps.  That's how I talk about raps to my black friends.  Hey, I like that guy.  He's got some good raps.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Does it like that?  I enjoy his raps.  Like I met Snoop and I said to him,  Hey there, Mr. Doggy Dog.  Love your raps.  Oh, yeah.  What did he say?  Trauma hot pockets.  Yeah.  I said, I don't know what you're saying with a fishizzle and a hizzle.  I just like your raps.  Fishizzle.  You think he's overdoing the izzle? 
[01:53:30]  Oh, the izzle and the hot puck izzles.  You think he might be overusing that now?  I won't even say it in reference to rain.  Even if it's a light rain, I'll just say light rain.  Hey, we got a picture of Sophia's boob there.  What?  What's her name?  Sophia Vergara.  Sophia Vergara.  Vergara.  Vergara.  You see this yet?  No.  Her boobie popped out New Year's.  Who dat?  That kind of Hispanic brood from that show Modern Family. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, she's that fucking brood.  Yeah, she's got the big knockers.  Her tit fell out?  Yeah.  What does that look like?  Well, that's what I want to know because I went to one site yesterday and they were bragging  about how her tit fell out, but they didn't show the picture.  Why is that, Sam?  All the sites...  They had it blocked out.  Yeah, they all have it blocked out.  What happened?  Wait, you can't find it?  I'm sure I can.  I'm just not good at finding stuff.  Oh, wow.  At least, finally, we got a fucking acknowledgement. 
[01:54:30]  Why aren't you good at finding stuff?  See, look.  That's the picture I saw.  Yeah, the TMZ one is everywhere.  Yeah, but it's blocked.  Why would they block it?  It's a little black thing over the...  Who are they scared of, really?  They don't curse or show nudity.  They don't.  Oh, they don't?  No.  AOL owns them.  I don't know if that's to do it.  Well, someone should.  They don't curse or they don't ever...  Everything's bleeped out or blacked out.  Oh, that's too bad.  So how are we going to see this tit?  Yeah.  Who's got the link?  Who gets the credit today? 
[01:55:00]  Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.  Oh, gee, she ought to be more careful.  That's right, Sprout.  Nip Slip.  Oh, what is that?  There's a whole site called the Nip Slip?  Of course there is.  Come on.  Who's got it?  Of course we've got to wait for the delay.  Oh, Rihanna.  Rihanna changing her bikini.  You don't like Rihanna, huh?  No.  No?  Yeah.  I mean...  She's beautiful, man.  I think so, too.  Yeah, she's a very good-looking ass.  Come on.  Come on.  No?  What am I going to fuck? 
[01:55:30]  Maybe close your eyes.  Why am I fucking...  Feel around a little bit?  Why would I say that?  Why would I...  Nothing?  I don't find the majority of the black women attractive.  I don't find them attractive.  It's my personal taste.  That's some psychological shit.  No, it really isn't.  Because there's some black broads out there that are pretty fucking...  Dude, and I do acknowledge ones that are very attractive.  But I can have a certain taste of a woman that does not include black features. 
[01:56:00]  That's true.  So that I don't...  Nothing right there?  No.  Wow.  Who's that saying?  You wouldn't suck those big tits?  That's Megan Good.  She's universally known.  Yeah, I mean, at first she was bad, but now she's making good...  That's a good one.  Fucking take us out, you pig.  It's funny.  No, no, no.  I don't find the features.  But her tits.  There's no features to them.  They're big and suckable.  No.  No.  That sucked Megan's good tits. 
[01:56:30]  No?  No.  Her name should be Megan Great.  No.  No?  No.  No?  There are things that...  No.  No?  No, there are just some things about black women I don't like.  I don't like certain features and other things.  I, uh...  Hair.  That's how I feel about Indian broads.  Yeah?  Yep.  There you go.  So, you're not off base too much.  I've found some Indian broads to be pretty goddamn hot.  To be quite honest.  I have found, in my experience, when I was putting up some numbers, 
[01:57:00]  Uh-huh.  They're a bit on the hairy side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Black girls?  No.  My thing is Indian girls.  Oh, Indian girls.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not American Indian, by the way.  Yeah, Hindu.  Or, you know, from India.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they're a little rough.  That's mine.  Yeah.  What's yours, Jimmy?  What, the nationality I find the least sexy?  Yeah, the least sexy.  That's the best way to put it.  I would say, I've only fooled around with one Indian girl. 
[01:57:30]  I think.  And it was okay, or two.  Yeah.  Um, I wasn't that crazy about it.  Um, I've had a lot of good experiences with black girls.  Yeah.  Have you, like a Mau Mau?  Well, Mau Mau.  Like really kind of fucking, like African.  No, just like, you know, American black girls.  No, you put in Mau Mau, like Chairman Mau.  I don't know how to spell the other Mau.  Oh, my God.  How do you spell Mau Mau?  I don't know.  Okay, then.  I've never heard Mau Mau. 
[01:58:00]  Is that another one of those, uh...  It sounds like a gun, Ope.  Yeah.  What's Mau Mau, eh?  Come on.  Let's see if he can spell it.  Go Mau Mau.  Look, you'll see.  Yeah, go there.  Put, like, F.  Oh, there they are.  Oh, that's meow, meow.  Look at it.  It's a basket full of kittens, for the love of Christ.  How many views does that have?  Eight.  Million.  Oh, boy.  Kittens are faggots.  So you didn't come up with the girls you don't like the most?  I'm thinking that my experience has been with...  Or like the least. 
[01:58:30]  There's Mau Mau.  I'm not a big fan of, uh...  Kenny just came in.  This can't be good.  It's never good when Kenny...  I'll put my finger on the dump button.  When Kenny decides to get a mic, it's never good.  Yes, Kenny.  You ever go out with a Filipino girl?  Oh.  Oh, no.  I know.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Kenny.  Obvious.  We got a big audience now.  We don't need these jokes anymore.  I went out with a Filipino girl once.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah, but by the end of the night, she wasn't Filipino.  She was full of penis. 
[01:59:00]  When you went out with her, I wish Harry Chapin was driving you.  He couldn't wait to come in.  Oh, he had to.  That's the best part of it.  He couldn't wait to come in.  I like to contribute sometimes.  Kenny.  Thank you.  Where were we?  Talking about Mouse Mouse.  Oh, Mouse Mouse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, that's, you know, because there are very light-skinned black girls.  Um, and then there are darker black girls. 
[01:59:30]  Like, uh, Grace Slick?  Do you have a preference as far as that goes?  Like Grace Slick?  Black?  Um, yeah.  Grace Slick.  What?  Grace Slick?  Why is she black?  What's that?  Grace Slick?  Put Grace Slick in there.  No, Grace Jones.  Oh, Grace Jones.  I don't like Grace Slick from...  Grace Jones.  No, that's not how you spell Grace Slick.  He spelled Gray Slick. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, Sam.  Grace Jones, of course.  Grace Jones is very, very dark.  Yeah.  No, they get darker than that.  I know, but even her, like, she just looks scary, too.  Intimidating.  Yeah.  She would rip your ball bag in half.  She looks scary.  Yeah.  Did you have a big song?  Oh, she did have a video back in the...  And that's Grace Slick from...  Yeah.  Wow, look at what she looks like now, all the way to the left.  Is that really what she looks like?  Yeah.  That's your shit?  That's her now.  Oh, fuck.  That's your shit? 
[02:00:30]  Oh, I fucked up, obviously, asshole.  That's really her, huh?  Boy, within you, Dad, don't you want somebody to love?  Yeah.  She looks like Pat from Munaki.  She does.  I'm Grace Slick.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, my mom is oil.  One pill makes you smaller, larger.  The other makes you small.  I guess I didn't get that other pill.  Wow, she does look awful. 
[02:01:00]  So, can we get Sophia's boob?  Yeah, where is that one?  Did we find it yet?  Oh, this is a TMZ picture.  Oh, fuck, man.  Well, TMZ should at least hint where the real picture is.  What if it's their picture?  I might have it.  I might have it.  Let me see.  Yes.  That's all it was?  That's it?  What?  That's all it was?  No, that's not it.  Let's see.  It's not the same dress.  Oh.  Oh, man.  She's had to have had a nip slip earlier with all those... 
[02:01:30]  With the dresses and the giant titties.  Maybe?  Here's the video of the nip slip.  Very cool.  There you go.  If you go to Funkin Wesley on Twitter, that's F-U-N-K-I-N-W-E-S-L-E-Y.  He's got the video of the nip slip.  You want to go there for everybody, Sam?  Well, let's see that.  Okay.  Funkin, F-U-N-K-I-N, Wesley, W-E-S-L-E-Y.  You got it?  Have you clicked the video?  Yeah, I did.  Okay. 
[02:02:00]  I saw it coming.  Thank you.  I love grapes.  This is a video of Hopi's...  All your grapes.  Oh, gee, he ate all my grapes, Hope.  I'm taking all Jamie's grapes.  More importantly, the link led to...  What link?  ...a video of an amazing no-look basketball.  Oh, my God!  What?  All right.  Of course.  He got him to click on the basketball trick shot.  I knew it was going to happen.  No, you didn't.  You didn't know, I don't think. 
[02:02:30]  I absolutely knew.  You knew that time?  100%.  Are you sure?  No, 100%.  Are you sure?  Yep.  You know what?  We just asked the Twitter audience.  No one could find the actual picture where her tit is out.  I think it's...  Everything says here...  So that means it didn't happen.  ...unless TMZ got it exclusively.  And then decided not to show everyone, so that means it didn't really happen.  If no one could see it.  Like a tree falling?  Nobody's around.  And no one's around.  Doesn't make a sound.  If they got the picture exclusively, but decided to put the black bar over it, then nothing happened officially. 
[02:03:00]  Maybe you can't really see your nipple, and the black bar implies you can.  Hmm?  Right?  It's a blurry shot.  I like how you think.  Give me a grape.  Grapes for everybody.  Grapes for everyone.  Come get it.  He didn't put it in his mouth.  Come get it.  By the way, Jimmy's farts on the way home yesterday were fucking brutal.  You want some grapes?  Yes, please. 
[02:03:30]  Pass some Elpster.  These are good.  Better than yesterday's?  Yeah.  Yes.  They're very good.  If I take this many, is that too much?  I don't care.  I'm going to eat all of them.  I took such a giant fucking bunch.  Boy, you guys ought to call yourselves the Bushel Twins.  You never know when you pull out that little stalk, that little bunch of grapes, if it's  going to be a big bunch.  I didn't know about the grapes.  Or a small bunch.  I grabbed a big bunch.  Jimmy had baby farts yesterday.  It's the only way I can describe him. 
[02:04:00]  Ew.  Did he need to change it?  I'd rather clean my son's diaper than smell one of his fucking farts.  That was a bad one, right?  Yeah.  His farts are way worse than actually cleaning up his diaper.  That's the picture.  That's it.  Right.  So we got to move on, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know why we're so obsessed with seeing this guy.  Oh, good one.  He's doing a Godfather impression with the grapes.  This is what comics do.  I'm the grape father. 
[02:04:30]  I'm going to make him a jelly.  I can't refuse.  You can act like a raisin.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Stop whining.  Act like a man.  Get it.  Whine.  I do.  No.  Or if he should be stepped on.  With a winemaking accent. 
[02:05:00]  Then I'm going to blame some of the grapes in here.  And then I do not vine give.  See, instead of forgive, vine give.  You know what this proves?  Look how they massacred my Cabernet.  It proves that Marlon Brando is just a hack.  If Jimmy's doing just as good with a couple grapes in his mouth.  Very good.  Hey, can we all tweet Harvey Levin and say, what the fuck, Harvey?  Give us the fucking picture.  You asshole.  I think so.  Let's do that.  What's his Twitter? 
[02:05:30]  Everyone fucking tweet Harvey Levin and say that we demand.  Harvey.  Opie and Anthony demand the actual picture.  Stop futzing around.  What's wrong with Harvey?  His breath.  His brain is going soft with all the karma with this young girl.  It's Harvey Levin, TMZ.  All one word.  Fucking tweet Harvey and go, what the fuck, Harvey?  Where's the picture?  You can't have the exclusive and then not show anything. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you.  Maybe my sister Shirley could get the picture.  Hey, Harvey.  Harvey.  I didn't read the funny papers.  It's a picture of Sofia Vergara at Sal's.  So?  Who cares?  Pizza place.  Oh.  You know where that is?  Is that the place we've been?  No, I haven't taken it there yet.  Best Chester.  That's another West Chester pizza place.  Is she from up there?  I don't think so.  She's from Colombia.  No, I know, but she had to live in America somewhere, don't you think?  Probably Los Angeles.  Los Angeles.  Fishman is telling you to check your Twitter. 
[02:06:30]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Well.  Why, you blocked him?  We'll see.  Oh, Fishman.  I know Fishman on Twitter.  Let me see.  Fishman.  Fishman.  All right, we got a see-through shirt pick.  Before you get the official plug, I want to make sure it's official.  Is that the real pick, though?  Or is Fishman?  That's why I'm not giving his actual Twitter until I see the pick.  Fishman might have been trying to do us a favor, but it might get him bounced out of the peltop.  Why is Fishman? 
[02:07:00]  Did you call yourself Abe Vigoda?  Do you just want titty shots of Sofia Vergara?  Oh, way, you.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  He gets the plug today.  Fishman gets a reprieve.  He is Fishman5440 on Twitter.  All one word.  Yeah, it's an older picture of her, but it's a see-through number.  Hey.  Do you have your filter on?  No.  Oh.  I don't know why when I go to fucking Google Images, every fucking time on my phone, I have to reset my fucking safe thing for explicit. 
[02:07:30]  Let me say.  Oh, gee, guys.  Our cans are showing.  Do you like that, Sprout?  Oh, gee, I don't know.  They ought to block that.  Holy shit.  The set of udders.  Gee whiz.  Knockers?  Knockers.  Those are fat, suckable fucks.  Which one?  Wow, look at her ass.  Tits.  Is that a real ass picture? 
[02:08:00]  Holy shit.  Is that real?  That looks very airbrushed.  Oh, would I eat that fucking ass?  That looks very Photoshopped, the entire photograph.  You sure?  100%.  Who's that basketball player she's with?  Oh.  It's not a basketball player.  What?  Oh, my God.  Football player?  No, I don't think it's an athlete.  All right, I'm sorry.  I was just asking.  It's a guy in a suit.  Oh, my God.  I can't even say what we're looking at.  What is Jimmy?  Jimmy rolled away to fart.  Oh. 
[02:08:30]  It's a nice picture.  It is.  She's got a bunch of fucking...  She used to be a bikini model.  Oh, then Iraq probably knows about her.  Yeah.  He gets bikini girls all the time.  We're not giving up on this nip slip.  I don't want to move on because it's something we should find, no?  Well, as long as the guy didn't get hurt.  All right, wait.  I might have another...  Come on, man.  Well, ouch.  I guess that's all it is, but that's a different dress, you're saying?  That's a different dress. 
[02:09:00]  Holy fuck.  Well, wait.  That's not the same picture.  Then that was another time it kind of slipped out.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but she's doing a big archie back and it's like...  I don't know.  That's crazy.  She's amazing.  Is this what you want to see?  What is that?  I'll give him a plug.  What the fuck?  Because that's funny.  Wow.  A-M-E-S-I-B.  Aim-sib, I guess. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  I guess we officially got to move on.  Tell Harvey Levin to go fuck himself for not putting the picture out there, at least  telling us where we could actually see it.  Thanks for nuttin'.  He grabs it as an exclusive and then makes sure no one sees it.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Gets a lot of press without pissing anyone off.  What the fuck's that about?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Did you guys see Rex Ryan's tattoo in the paper today?  What the fuck is going on with that?  That's a little weird.  He's a weirdo.  He is a weirdo, right?  Jets coach, of course. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And he's on vacation.  Someone snapped him, snapped a picture of his tattoo on his arm.  It's his wife in a Mark Sanchez jersey.  What is that about?  And the tattoo, she's bent all the way over and she's only wearing, like, the jersey.  We already know that.  That's fucking weird.  That Rex Ryan and his wife are into some wild things.  But now...  Foot guy, foot lover.  But people are saying this could absolutely hurt him because, you know, the Jets are trying  to move on from Mark Sanchez now. 
[02:10:30]  But he...  I mean, he could cover that up easily.  Why did he get it in the first place?  Because he's weird.  He's got a lot of tattoos.  Jesus.  Yeah, that's fucking strange, man.  Her ass, look.  She's...  Yeah, her ass is coming out from the bottom of the jersey.  The tattoo's not wearing...  Yeah.  She's not wearing any pants in the tattoo.  Of course, her feet are showing.  Any drawers.  She loves the feet.  She's not wearing drawers.  She's got that foot fetish-y thing.  Yeah.  He's a weird guy. 
[02:11:00]  But the sports people, they're all up in arms over this.  What's the big deal?  He believed in Sanchez?  Yeah.  Fucking got a tattoo on his arm.  Unless he got it after the season.  That would be really crazy.  Maybe he just liked a picture of her when she happened to be wearing that jersey.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Do you think that...  I wonder if Sanchez ever, like, licked his wife's feet or something.  No.  Maybe.  Why not?  Maybe you wanted to watch.  Maybe he's a cuckold.  Oh, Jesus.  Maybe Sanchez is a big penis. 
[02:11:30]  Oh.  Gives the wife a good stick it in her face.  Yikes.  And Sanchez has that info, and that's why Rex Ryan could never move on from him?  No, no.  Maybe he just thinks it's hot.  He likes that dick.  No, but I'm just saying that, you know, Sanchez reminds him before every game, I know some  things.  Likes to see it, not to, you know.  Right.  Right.  Maybe Sanchez comes over after the game without washing his athletic supporter.  Sure.  I don't know. 
[02:12:00]  I'll tell you.  I do appreciate a good foot on a girl, though.  Really?  Not in a fetishy way.  But it's gotta be a, you can't have one of these fucking nasty, fucking Paris Hilton  foot.  Do you like them?  I like meaty feet.  Do you like meaty feet?  I like big feet on a girl, but feminine.  Yeah?  Not fucking masculine feet.  But will it, like, turn you off to the girl?  I gotta be honest with you.  Really?  There are times, like, I like the entire female form from head to toe. 
[02:12:30]  So if I'm looking, you know, getting that, uh, what they call a fuck position.  And if I'm looking down like that, I want to see the whole thing.  Right.  And if I get to that foot and it's fucking gnarly, it's gonna fuck things up.  Oh, then go for it!  Just adjust your view. 
[02:13:00]  Take the feet out of play.  No, I need to see the whole thing.  Do you like when it looks like the toes go all the way to the ankle?  What, like that ligament?  Yeah, but it makes it look like the toes are that long.  No, you don't like that?  I don't like those at all.  I like a nice, curvy, soft foot.  I don't like a lot of that fucking ligament shit.  I want to see the workings of it, like Terminator after he walked out of the fire foot.  As long as, uh, it doesn't have hammer toes, I'm fine.  Whatever. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, that's good.  As long as they're kind of all pointing where they're supposed to be pointing, I'm good.  I could get past certain things.  But if it's like something like this and all that crap, then a big bunion.  Yeah, yeah, no bunions.  But if you've got all five toes and they're kind of pointing in the right direction, that's all I need.  No, there are certain ones that are really bad.  I love the women in the summer.  Who?  In the building?  Oh, uh, yes.  Nicole, feet are terrible.  Nicole.  Terrible feet.  Nicole has awful feet.  Like Mad Magazine feet.  I think about it every time she walks in. 
[02:14:00]  Really?  No matter how hot she looks, I'm thinking, yeah, she's got them fucking gnarly asses.  Have we ever told her to her face?  Let's do it.  Should I go grab her?  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's do it.  Yo, tell the bitch we want to give her some grapes.  Let's do it.  Come on in here, bitch.  Have a grape.  Who's going to break the news?  I'll do it.  You're going to do it?  This is yours?  Oh, I love this.  All right, good.  Because, yeah, I look at her, and obviously she's a pretty girl.  Nicole from the morning mashup.  Word.  But I can't stop thinking about that fucking, uh, those feet of hers. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, Sam's getting her.  I walked past the mashup the other day going to the bathroom, and they were looking at porn  in there.  What?  Some video of a legit mom and daughter tag team called the Sexton's.  It wasn't legit.  Oh, it's not legit.  Jesus, how naive are you?  They're never legit.  I don't want, I'd walk by, and they go, this is some legit video.  It's not legit.  Oh, you should have said, they said it was legit.  I wish it was legit, and you would quit.  I don't mean that, Iraq. 
[02:15:00]  I think you're invaluable.  You know that.  Yeah, we like you.  I love Iraq.  He's irreplaceable.  I said like.  Okay.  Fair enough.  The point was, they watch porn.  I.  Fucking Iraq.  They were watching porn.  The point is.  They're dirty.  They're dirty over there.  Yeah, that's, by the way, she got hurt.  Horrible.  Horrible feet.  Wait, what?  On the bottom.  Well, they already showed her.  Yeah.  Why are we waiting?  The bed?  Yeah, because the fucking, it's no secret. 
[02:15:30]  Models are in shoes all the time.  Gotta wear them goddamn fucking shoes that don't fit a lot of the times.  When they do those shows, they squeeze their feet into shoes that are either too small,  or they gotta, like, put other shit in the cardboard in there to make them because they're too big.  So they wind up getting all fucking, like, fucked up and calloused and shit.  Oh, no.  Damn.  Here she comes.  Terrible.  Oh, here she comes.  Shh, shh, shh.  Quiet.  There she is.  Hey, Nicole.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year. 
[02:16:00]  Good evening.  How was your holidays?  It was great, actually.  You want a grape?  I would love a grape.  Phenomenal.  Can I have a few?  Yeah, they're watched.  We've been eating grapes like crazy today.  How's your relationship?  It's going really, really well.  Is it?  Yeah.  Because last we heard, not so good.  Yeah, you were on, like, bad footing.  Yeah, I told him to get a shit together or we're going to have some problems.  Are you on better footing now with him?  Way better footing.  And he's being super sweet.  And are you playing Words with Friends?  Yes.  While you're on the air?  I can do it.  Why not?  Yes.  I do.  Because last we heard, he was being quite the heel. 
[02:16:30]  We all play our little dance.  You know what?  He's been really good.  Yeah.  He said he was going to be home at a certain time last night and he came home.  Oh.  That's quite a feat.  And I, you know, I gave it to him because, you know, to reward him.  Your vagina?  Yeah.  Good.  That's like, but yeah, when you're coming at it from a different angle like that, it's  like, it's the way to do it is to not fight, but fucking fuck when they do something  right.  Do you consider yourself still soulmates?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I do.  He really is my best friend.  And he just, you know, he's just sort of, he's, he's a reformed party boy womanizer. 
[02:17:00]  Ah.  Oh, boy.  Why are you looking at pictures of me?  So he's kind of tangled in that old webbing.  That's a nice picture of you two.  We're very happy.  I love him.  It looks like it's New Year's Eve in Times Square.  It was, yeah.  So you nailed him.  I did.  I gave it to him good.  You guys are a great pair.  We are?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just a good pair.  Good looking pair.  Thank you.  You know, nobody wants to date sneaks.  That's the fucking worst.  And they're not doing that.  No.  And he's towing the line, obviously, now.  He's what?  Towing the line.  Like doing his part.  He used to be a heel. 
[02:17:30]  He's no longer right.  Well, he's a reformed womanizer.  I mean, he was really bad.  He was bad news.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He used to bang the world.  Oh, nice.  Did he really?  I might have been a stretch, but, you know.  I respect that.  Why is that a stretch?  No.  Nothing.  He could be, he could be reformed.  I agree.  And just wants to ask you something.  Okay, go ahead.  What?  You nailed him?  We did that one.  When?  Oh, you didn't.  Jimmy said that already.  Last night, to reward him for coming home when he said he was going to come home.  Good for you.  Absolutely.  Where was he?  Had he gone to market?  Just had a couple beers.  Or you stayed home? 
[02:18:00]  No, just had a couple beers with one of his old buddies.  Yeah.  Was he an athlete at any point?  Yeah.  Oh.  Do you, um, are you wearing Uggs?  Yeah.  How ironic.  Why?  Why is that ironic?  I just thought so.  Why?  Now, this is all Anthony, by the way.  What are Uggs?  No, they're comfortable shoes.  You want to put them on?  See how delicious they feel?  No, I know.  Uggs are probably very nice.  All right.  They're super cozy.  Put on her Uggs.  Okay.  It's supposed to be worn barefoot, but. 
[02:18:30]  Let me see.  You're barefoot.  I'm not.  Oh, my God.  You're supposed to wear them barefoot?  Yeah, because they're super warm and you're just hot.  They're like slippers, right?  I can't believe I'm letting Jim Norton put my Ugg on.  I can't believe you're letting him.  I can't believe I'm doing it.  How does it feel?  It might be contagious.  All right.  That shit feels good.  Yeah, it does.  You like it?  Except I need, I have arches.  Like, I have really, uh, my feet aren't really ugly, but I have a fucking, uh.  Just give me my Ugg.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Wait, I want to see Jimmy.  Can you put your foot up on the table?  I want to see you in an Ugg.  Oh, you want to see me? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Do you get, um.  Thank you.  Just ask me the fucking question.  What is going on here?  What's the question?  Are they comfy?  They're so comfortable.  Oh, gee, these feel good.  What size do you take?  That's spread.  I have, I have rather large feet.  All right.  That's what we're getting at.  Okay, yeah.  They're, they're, they're.  Now, we've heard tell.  Now, you, you, you are known around these parts.  Yeah.  As an attractive girl.  Very beautiful.  That's very nice of you.  You walk around the hallways.  A lot of the guys look.  Your nickname is what?  Biggins?  Yeah.  Whoa, Jesus.  Oh, that's nice. 
[02:19:30]  Say she grabs her boobs.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Uh, but, um, there's the one feature that has come across.  Yeah.  That some people have a.  Well, God can't give you everything.  Okay?  I got no ass.  I got awful feet.  I got bunions.  I got.  Can I see your foot?  No.  Why?  Could you just please pop it up on them?  They're so ugly.  You fuck.  Sam got a picture.  Do you have no ass?  I have no ass.  No.  No.  I work on it. 
[02:20:00]  I try to do squats, but there's, there's not a whole lot of tush.  You got enough there.  Relax.  There's enough.  There's that much going on.  Yeah.  Turn around.  Let's see.  It's pretty flat.  Let's see the ass.  You see?  That's not that bad.  Not bad.  Not at all.  You know, she's arching forward like she's fucking.  Trying to make.  Oh, you are.  Like the guy's skiing.  Maybe if someone steps on your feet, it'll pop out your ass like a balloon.  My feet are bad.  God.  God fucked me with the feet.  Bad.  Bad.  Bad.  Bad.  Bad.  Bad.  They're really bad.  I do have.  They're big.  I don't mind big feet.  They are big.  They're big.  They're flat. 
[02:20:30]  The boys call my toes talons.  Talons.  I don't mind that either.  You have very.  I have bunions.  Do you have bunions?  Yeah, bad bunions.  Dress him?  I gotta see.  We're friends.  We're not sleeping either.  I gotta see with you just like put it flat on the floor.  Let's see.  Wow.  I'll tell you.  All right.  They wouldn't be bad.  That is a crazy ass foot right there.  I'll tell you.  Her foot wouldn't be bad if the bunion on the right and the left is the problem.  Get them fixed.  Wow. 
[02:21:00]  Your toes length is fine.  Holy smoke.  That one's worse?  This one has a thing here.  What is that?  I don't know.  What is it?  Boat spur.  Boat spur.  Totally ganglion.  All right.  Are you done with me?  Now listen.  Your feet would be suckable if you just got rid of those bunions.  Stop taking pictures of my feet, Sam.  I have this other show to do and I know you love it.  I don't mind your long toes.  You're way better on our show.  It's wonderful for swimming.  For swimming?  Yeah.  Oh.  Like I have built in flippers.  I don't mind long toes. 
[02:21:30]  Can you shave down the bunions or something?  Yeah.  You can get the surgery, but they say it's the most painful surgery that exists.  I don't think so.  So you wait until it's really painful.  Do they hurt?  Do they smell bad, your feet?  No.  You don't have hammer toes, though.  They're all pointing in the right direction.  Yeah.  You know what?  It wasn't that bad.  Nah, they could be a lot worse.  Yeah.  Although you wouldn't look and go, oh, those are sexy feet, though.  No way.  I used to dive.  No.  I have really flat feet, though, and I used to dive.  Like I was a diver.  Yeah.  And I used to...  That sometimes. 
[02:22:00]  Holy...  But when I was diving, you know, you want your feet to be pointed nice and like...  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I had trouble with that because I have flat feet.  Oh, shit.  So these would call me boots because they would just go in and I used to lose points.  Too much splash.  By the time you hit...  By the time your hands went into the pool, your feet are still flat on the diamond wood?  Yes.  That is what happened.  Aw.  Yeah.  So thanks for boosting my confidence, guys.  No problem.  I thought they're much better than I thought they were going to be.  Yeah.  And you enjoy the feel of the Ugg.  Yeah, but again, I didn't know what I thought.  Let me see.  It's on Twitter. 
[02:22:30]  You're a fuck face.  Goodbye.  Oh, take it easy.  There goes Nicole.  There she goes.  What is that from a monster?  From a morning mashup.  Oh, she picked up a rabbit on our way.  Wow, there's a Sam...  Holy shit.  That looks fake.  That looks like something...  The creature from the Black Lagoon painted his toenails.  It is.  It's one of those rubber Halloween feet.  Yes, that doesn't look real, dude.  Her big toe has an extra joint.  That is a crazy fucking foot.  I mean, if people want to see it, it's not Sam on Twitter and Instagram. 
[02:23:00]  Not Sam.  All right.  You're lucky.  If people want to see it.  Dude.  I can't even say that's a cheap place.  That is a...  That's a cheap...  What?  She's got an awful foot.  It's an awful foot.  It's not as bad as you made it out to be.  No, it's terrible.  Did you see what she was moving her toes, dude?  But the toes are all, like...  No.  Here's the problem.  In the right direction.  Here's the problem.  That's my issue.  She put it flat.  She put it flat on the rug.  When she walks and does things, imagine that up on your fucking, like, up on your coffee 
[02:23:30]  table every night when you're watching TV, and then the toes start, like, moving.  Like, people just kind of put their toes and move them, and you just got to look at it,  and you're like, ah!  Yeah, the big toe kind of moves like a thumb.  Yes!  Like, it moves on the side.  Yeah!  Get it out of here!  I'm trying to watch television.  Not only can she flick a nickel, but she can do that fucking deal that Penn was describing.  What's it called?  The Farrow deal.  The Farrow deal.  Or the Farrow shuffle.  The Farrow shuffle.  The Farrow shuffle.  She can do it with her big feet.  Oh, man.  What's Nicole on Twitter?  Look at how much foot there is before you even get to the giant toe mashup, Nicole. 
[02:24:00]  If they had no bunions, and they were kind of, like, straight, I would worship those feet.  No.  Smell them and worship them.  No.  I like a good, I like a cute foot.  It's got to be a good size that's proportioned, and it's got to have the right width to length,  and it's got to have a good, like, a bit of cushiness to it.  Do you like when it stinks a little?  I don't care.  I don't mind that either.  I don't need fucking, you know, trash foot.  No.  I don't mind if a girl takes her shoes off, and you smell like that she was, you know, 
[02:24:30]  in some shoes.  I don't like dirty feet.  Like, I don't want you walking barefoot, but if these shoes are in sneakers and socks,  and they're stinky, I'll smell those toes and fucking blow a load in her.  My ex always hated, like, because her feet smelled pretty good, like, sexy dirty, but  when she would wear these fucking shoes with these really big wool socks, her feet fucking  reeked, like, cheese doodles. 
[02:25:00]  That turned you on?  No.  That one, that was the only scent she had that didn't, when she wore those socks.  So I would call her, like, cheese doodles or cheese puffs, so my nickname for her was  doodle puffs, and she fucking hated it.  You are a prick.  Yeah, I'd be like, come here, doodle puffs, and she would fucking hate it.  Doodle puffs.  You guys got to get back together.  You don't want to hear doodle puffs.  No.  Any girl that will put up with that, you should do it.  Oh, I know.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  That is fucking hilarious.  Have you gotten any comments yet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A whole bunch.  I wanted some comments on Nicole's feet so far. 
[02:25:30]  Let me read them out here.  And don't Twitter her and say things about her feet.  Yeah, yeah, don't do that.  Mashup, Nicole?  Mashup, Nicole.  Yeah.  Don't be tweeting her.  I mean, she's verified, so.  And don't copy the picture and then, you know, send it to her.  Don't Photoshop it.  Don't Photoshop it.  We don't need any of that.  Like, again, on a movie monster.  Some of the comments include, yikes. 
[02:26:00]  Hobbit?  Hobbit foot, yeah.  Fucking ape feet.  Ape foot.  Even Rex Ryan would run away from that.  Hashtag, this is why her husband is getting side pussy.  That's not cool.  Damn it.  Wolf.  Eel.  Wolf foot, yes.  Hunchback style.  We need, just need hair like Sasquatch.  Wait, wait, Sam.  Instead of a foot, it looks like she's got like five feet or something. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, like length.  Oh, boy.  Gather round, kids, for a tale of childhood trauma.  It's a molestation memory with our friend, Jim Florentine.  My dad used to take us to wrestling matches at Madison Square Garden.  And we met this guy out front who would sell wrestling pictures.  Fat guy, 300 pounds, a bad mustache.  You know, and we became friends with him somehow.  He's like, oh, give me your address.  He started sending us pictures of all the kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call me on the phone and tell me about the match the night before. 
[02:27:00]  And my voice was about this.  It was this deep at 14.  He's on the other end, and I'm asking all these questions, and he's fucking breathing heavy.  I had no idea.  But then he wound up staying over at my house.  He knew all the kids in the neighborhood because we all go to the matches.  He convinced my dad.  He's like, oh, you know, I want to hang with the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  He took the bus from New York to New Jersey.  And my parents are a little weird about it.  Like, I don't know, but like, all right, you know, they talk to the other parents and neighbor. 
[02:27:30]  You think this is all right?  You know, he's a 40-year-old guy hanging around 14-year-olds.  They put him in the guest room the night before.  I wake up in the morning.  I'm sleeping.  He has his hand on my pants.  He snuck down there, and I fucking jump.  I go, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm showing you a magic trick.  I'm like, a magic trick?  I just said, I ran to the door to go tell my brothers, my older brothers, and he blocked the door.  He goes, he went right to the photo album.  He goes, look, I got 50 pictures, and I'll give you 35 of them if you don't say anything.  But my brothers were like, my brothers afterwards go, you've got to tell mom and dad about this. 
[02:28:00]  I go, no, because they were going to make me give the pictures back.  I'm like, fuck that.  I earned them.  Fucking kissed him on the cheek.  I sat on his lap.  He grabbed my cock.  I should have got that in this camera.  This has been a Molestation Moment with our friend Jim Florentine.  Now you know why he is the way he is.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opinion Anthony Show.  I want to welcome Adam Farrar to the show, playing Levity Live this weekend, tonight through Sunday. 
[02:28:30]  Nice.  I like Levity Live.  Yeah, it's nice.  Comedy Club up there in...  Up there in Nyack.  Nyack.  The Palisades Mall.  Go up to Palisades Parkway.  Is that a foot?  Let me tell you.  Allegedly.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What do you think of that foot?  It's like a foot and a half.  Yes.  It's...  Is it larger than a... 
[02:29:00]  Wait a minute.  Just tell us what you think of it.  That's all.  It looks like when, like in the cartoons, when you want to make make-believe foot, Bigfoot  tracks.  Uh-huh.  It's like Bugs Bunny would walk with that.  And that's what it kind of looks like.  It looks longer than a...  Than the normal foot.  Than a normal foot.  There's like extra shit to it, right?  Yeah.  There's five toes.  I counted, right?  One, two, three, four, five toes.  You know what?  If you look...  It looks like it could have six toes.  Yes, it does.  It does.  That's why I had to count, but there's a hammer toe in there.  There should count.  Yeah.  There's a bunion. 
[02:29:30]  There's a bunion on the way.  Big, nasty bunion.  That's a bunion.  Big, long, talon toes.  The whole foot is fucking crazy big.  You could peel a banana with that fucking foot.  Yeah, sure.  Whose foot?  Is that your foot?  No.  No.  It's got paint on it.  You want to see whose foot it is?  Yeah.  Go get her.  Whose foot is it?  Go get her.  Go get her again.  She's hit the rest of the person.  Yeah, we're going to show you whose foot that is.  Yeah, it's real fast.  You keep her locked up?  Like, bring out the gimp?  Yeah, with that foot.  Because you're not going to believe whose foot that is. 
[02:30:00]  It's not Plankfoot's foot.  No, no.  Plankfoot's got a big-ass foot, though.  But he's a guy.  That's true.  Like, for a woman to be cursed with that foot.  You would swear, I mean, the nail polish gives it away.  You would swear that's a guy's foot.  It's a guy's foot.  Yeah, yeah.  You would swear.  Well, no, because there's no hair on it.  It's clean.  It's taken care of.  There's not that ashy shit on the bottom.  But it's big.  Yeah, it's big.  It's a big fucking foot.  It's a big girl.  Is it a big girl on a big foot?  Yes.  Well, she's a fatty.  What do you think she looks like?  I will tell you this.  It's a clean-looking foot.  I'm not into the Rex Ryan feet, but if I was... 
[02:30:30]  There's clean.  We were talking about feet before.  That's how this whole thing got started.  Thank you for mentioning Rex Ryan.  A lot of people start to say that tattoo is fake, and Rex Ryan's fucking with the media.  That would be hilarious.  Is he still in the Bahamas?  If he did that.  You know what?  You might be right.  Yeah, that's a good...  He does like to fuck with people.  That's a funny joke.  He may have her in the Jets jersey, and maybe he just put number six on his arm as a goof.  Uh-oh.  That's funny, though.  If he's...  I hope we might have failed.  Did we fail?  She said she'll be in in a little bit, but she's obviously in a bad mood. 
[02:31:00]  That's okay.  That means that...  Well, I didn't piss anybody off.  I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.  Oh, what are you kidding?  I just saw there was a giant foot.  We did it already.  We'll move on, but we're going to show you whose foot that is.  All right.  I'm sorry if I hurt someone's feelings.  No, believe me.  Our feelings are hurt well before you.  Exactly.  Well, don't leave that laying around.  I got distracted.  That is nasty.  That's a nasty foot.  Who gave the gun to the baby?  That's a nasty ass foot.  It really is not good.  What's going on with you, Adam? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, where have you been?  Just working, man.  I've been doing Top Gear.  We were doing that.  I got to drive.  I was telling Ann, I drove the GT40, the one that won Le Mans in 60...  Le Mans.  Le Mans.  In 68.  I drove it 12 feet.  Yeah, that's it.  That's all they gave you?  It's an $11 million car.  They brought it out of the museum.  Wow.  $11 million.  $11 million.  Irreplaceable.  Why 12 feet?  Why not a wide open space?  They let you go a mile.  Obviously, they've seen the show.  Yeah, yeah.  So they've seen the way I drive.  Adam, not the guy that took care of the car.  Did they say 12 feet?  Yeah, they said six. 
[02:32:00]  I did 12.  They went, okay, you.  So how do you drive a car six feet?  You roll until the big guy puts his hand up, and then that's it.  That's it.  But it was just a beast of a car.  It was a photo op for you.  That was part of the thing.  I got to drive that.  And then I drove a copy of it, a kit car, around the track, and I almost killed myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What kind of car is it?  It's a Ford GT was the kit car I drove.  Can we see the real one?  I like the GT.  I don't know anything about cars.  The GTs are fun to drive.  $11 million.  Adam, what's the fastest you've gone now in a car?  I've gone 180.  Because you were never a car guy, which we brought up many times in the show. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, yeah, terrible.  So now that you are officially a car guy, how fast have you gone?  I did 180 in a Lamborghini Superleggera.  Wow.  It was 180 when I looked down, when I lifted it 180.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I looked down.  Well, you know, when you're in it, you can't.  Yeah.  You go right on track?  Yeah.  Were you scared at 180?  Yes.  I was scared at 140.  At 140, it starts getting light, and it starts floating a little bit.  I took a GT out from the car club, and driving it from the car club.  Did they call you the cruiser?  You guys in your car club?  Call me the cruiser.  Guys in the car club, call me the cruiser. 
[02:33:00]  Should I call him the dork?  Then taking it from Manhattan to the expressway was quite the trip.  Wow.  As you know, it's not the best suspension on those things.  A little stiff.  Stiff.  It's like losing a kidney.  A little stiff, but man, once you get a road to open those up on, God, and they can stick.  They're nice.  God, a fun fucking car to drive.  The Lamborghini, at 140, it started floating a little bit, and then I hit the brake cone. 
[02:33:30]  I looked down at 180, but the brake cone's like, once you pass that cone, you got a brake,  you're going to run out of runway and go into the desert.  So I looked down, it was at 180.  Yeah.  So when you see that cone, you got it.  Yeah, you got it.  And everything's coming like really fast.  Oh, you're just going straight.  You're not going on a round track.  No, no.  That was the fastest I ever went in a straightaway.  Now, straightaway, it seems safer.  You'd have to fuck up to it.  Yeah, you just got to just hold on and not turn, because at 180, you turn it, the wheel.  And make sure, you know, nothing happens to your equipment. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  Make sure a jackrabbit doesn't run in front of your car.  That's right.  Yeah, that's scary shit.  Yeah.  What was the video you sent me?  You were in a...  Horse gags.  Horse gags.  And you tried to make it with the cow?  Yeah.  I went to Pocono.  Yeah.  And you had the harness, the whole neck.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a lot of fun.  I took a five liter, not your Shelby Mustang, just a regular five liter, around the Fontana 
[02:34:30]  track.  Yeah.  And they had NASCARs chasing us on the NASCAR track.  Wow.  I'm doing 150 in this thing.  And you know what?  The bank is fucking scary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I'm coming off the wall into the bank, and these...  The bank.  The cars are just...  The NASCARs, they're like angry painted dinosaurs just flying past you.  Yeah, there's no way you could compete with that.  No.  They're set up to do that.  Yeah, your car, not so much.  No, and that's the one you drove, right?  Yeah.  You drove the NASCAR.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were a fucking pisser. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  And then you get out, and you feel all cool about it.  Inside, you can't even think about having fun.  No.  You're just like, I could die doing this.  Sure.  I could hit the wall.  The adrenaline spike, you're like shaking and...  Yeah.  Right before you get in, it gets really scary.  Before you get in the car?  Yeah.  Why?  Because you realize you're going to be driving very fast.  Well, just drive...  It's like they say, sober.  Slow on booze, enjoy the road.  Just drive slow.  That's right.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Thank you.  Thank you, 10 and 2. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  See, that's crazier than what I did.  What did you do?  Yes.  What did you do?  Get unprotected sex with a man.  On your Haitian vacation.  There are two different things.  One is crazy, kind of, you know, adrenaline, excitement, take your life in your hands.  The other thing is, you know, you could maybe get in some trouble.  What did you do?  I just saw...  Well...  What did you...  We haven't discussed it on air yet.  We're still in the teasing stage.  Oh, okay.  Not because of me, because I promised a few...  He doesn't want to say it, but it rhymes with mape. 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  I did some underground exploring there, Adam.  You went spelunking?  Well, I did a little of that and then went somewhere else and saw some crazy shit.  Wow.  This is quite the tease.  Yeah.  We'll get to it eventually.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah, yeah.  There are videos of underground.  But I think what you did is way crazier.  It's crazier in that, you know...  I can't imagine going after that.  You know what would be great?  Getting a Lamborghini and going around a track and doing 55.  Yeah.  Driving responsibly. 
[02:36:30]  Well, you always did crazy shit when you built a dune buggy.  Remember driving a dune buggy you built?  Oh, yeah.  That was always...  Through the woods.  I would, like, build shit.  And no trails.  Just the woods along the woods.  That's pretty cool.  Just drive through the woods.  That seems cool.  Of course, intoxicated.  But there were no trails.  There were trees.  Yeah, I get it.  And a sump.  One time this fucking bitch...  God, these bitches!  When you're, like, fucking 17, 18, 19 years old, all my life was about was girls.  Was trying to find a girl.  Get a girl.  You just described every 17 year old. 
[02:37:00]  I know.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You should write a book.  So, yes.  I went to a party and I had my Baja bug.  It's a Volkswagen, but it's, you know, the fenders are off and it's all modified as an off-road vehicle.  And I was really going after this girl, you know, and I fucking wanted to have her.  She's at this party.  And she fucking goes off with some other guy and I'm fucking like...  The athlete?  No, no.  I didn't hang out with athletes. 
[02:37:30]  Probably some other stoned asshole that was in there that said the right fucking code.  That's all he did.  Another guy in a band.  Exactly.  Yes.  He broke the code.  He broke the code.  I couldn't.  I'm all pissed off.  So, I, like, grab the tequila and just start chugging it.  I'm pissed off.  I'm like, bleh, and go out and then I decide, fuck it, I'm going to grab the bottle, grab  the bottle, get into my vehicle.  So, it's good decision after good decision.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  And I'm going to drive through the woods.  I'm just going to fucking cruise through the woods.  And I'm drinking and fucking doing up these hills and I try to climb this one hill, couldn't 
[02:38:00]  quite make it up.  All right.  Brum, brum, brum, brum, brum.  The wheels start digging in.  So, in between getting my foot, like, off the gas and to the brake, it rolled backwards right  into a tree.  Oh, fuck.  Bam!  I'm like, oh, fuck.  In the rear engine bug.  Yeah, rear engine.  Air-cooled pancake motor now a pancake.  Yeah, it's got, it's fucking leaking oil.  I, I, I just look and there's no, now the thing is pointing up a hill with a tree behind 
[02:38:30]  it.  So, now I can't push it up.  All right.  Because, you know, I'm not just trying to push uphill.  I'm drunk.  So, I just, like, curled up in there and went to sleep.  Woke up the next morning.  I'm like, fuck.  Fucking Debbie!  Wound up getting Simo, Dave Simoleski.  And he, uh, showed up with a chainsaw to cut the tree down so we could roll the, roll  the vehicle backwards.  Yeah, we just chalked the wheels up.  Oh, wow.  Cut the tree down and kicked the fucking wheel chucks out and rolled it back.  So, uh, what a pain in the fucking ass though. 
[02:39:00]  And all because, and, and, before I even started driving, I had punched the windshield  and cracked it, spiderweb, the whole fucking windshield.  Because I was pissed at the girl.  Girl pissed him off.  The fucking girl that should have been with me.  Wait a minute.  She should be with me.  I'm so jealous.  I wish I had a Jessie's girl.  I'm so jealous.  Jessie's girl, she should be with me.  We're gonna find a woman like that.  Anthony, call me a, I hate that he's a buddy of mine. 
[02:39:30]  Hey, buddy of mine!  Whatever happened to the girl?  I guess she got fucked and went home.  You never heard from her again?  No, I can't even remember who it was.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it wasn't one of the girls that, like, became girlfriends or anything like that,  but, man, was I...  Those I remember.  I didn't remember.  Nah, the, uh, yeah, nah, I can't even remember.  It was just some girl I was fixated on that night.  I was putting in some time.  I put in some effort with the tequila and the fucking orange juice and the grenadine  to make tequila sunrises. 
[02:40:00]  Which usually...  Well, everybody else did.  That was usually a lock, dude.  We learned on a, on a pass show that he would, he would bring this combination.  That was my lock.  And it worked.  Because every other guy brought beer.  Everyone else had shitty beer.  Beer, or it was the Bartles and James years, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was the fucking wine cooler years.  Wine coolers and stuff.  It was all the 80s stuff.  I fucking brought the tequila, grenadine, and orange juice.  And then...  Who thinks this shit?  He's a mad scientist.  You just walked around, and like, you drink it.  He was experimenting with roofies, just making his own.  Girls wouldn't even, you wouldn't even have to approach a girl. 
[02:40:30]  Because you just go into a conversation.  Clink, clink, clink.  Oh, hello.  And she goes, oh, what are you drinking?  Oh, it's, it's a tequila sunrise.  Would you like one?  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  I'll make you one.  Boom.  She's with you now, alone.  Hey, look at you're making a drink.  It was the brilliant fucking move.  It was great, because he used to travel with the head station glasses.  You know?  Hey, at least it wasn't paper cups.  The superhero one.  Fucking, uh...  With the jokes on them.  Dixie joke cups.  Dixie, Dixie, Dixie joke cups.  Yeah.  Those are good for shots.  If you're doing shots in the bathroom, you'd toss those back. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  And then I get her all fucking, you know, I got to give her a couple of those.  And then this fucking vulture just comes swooping in.  What was his move?  Do you remember?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  He probably brought a whiskey sour mix.  Or maybe your tequila sunrise got her too drunk.  Got her loosened up.  She wasn't thinking right at that point.  Nah, he was probably some fucking naked-looking guy and shit.  It's the worst.  I hate good-looking guys. 
[02:41:30]  Hate them!  Adam Farrar, Levity Live this weekend.  Damn it.  Selling some tickets for Adam.  Thank you.  And then he's telling me outside.  Can I say what you told me?  Sure.  No surprise, right?  He's going to be on Nurse Jackie.  That's huge.  Oh!  Next season he's covering?  That's great.  Yeah, next season's really cool.  Look at you.  How many episodes did he give you?  I did, what, seven out of ten?  Oh, shit.  That's great.  You're in Nurse Jackie then.  Yeah, that's great.  Some of you guys come in and it's like, yeah, I'm part of this show.  And you're, you know, it's a little walk-on.  You got seven.  Yeah, and I was shooting it during the hurricane when it was here. 
[02:42:00]  And all my power went out.  So I wanted to go to Kaufman because my dressing room, my dressing room has better cable than  my apartment.  Yeah.  I got like the friggin' NFL network there.  So I tried to make it back there.  I couldn't make it.  But were you okay?  Yeah, I was, my power was out for like, uh.  I send you a text, but I just think they just go.  They just go with a text.  I think you have my old number.  I do?  Yeah.  Okay.  With the new one.  My old Naughty Boy phone.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  Great.  You gave me the whore phone number. 
[02:42:30]  Fuck you.  I thought, I thought it was special you made me a tequila sunrise.  I'm just some fucking notch on your belt, you prick.  After that girl fucked me up, I don't fucking, she ripped my heart out.  That was it.  Long Island got fucked by that storm.  Yeah.  My power was out for about nine days, 11 days, whatever the fuck it was.  I went out, I was out for four days, no heat, water, um, or a power, right?  So I had no toilet, no nothing.  Oh, man.  And, uh.  In the city here?  Yeah, right down the hill.  Oh, okay.  You were downtown.  I'm down the hill.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  But there was power.  You know where I charged my phone the first day?  Above 33rd Street?  Above 33rd Street in the trees at the restaurant.  Because they, you know those lights?  Christmas lights.  Christmas lights.  They were Christmas lights.  That's fucking great.  I found the plug.  No.  I was like a druid.  I was like, oh.  That's pretty cool.  Bring me power.  That's smart.  Yeah.  I never think of that.  People were camping out just, uh, charging their cell phones.  Yeah.  Right above 33rd.  Some places were nice.  They put out, like, a power strip.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Yeah.  A whole bunch of people just hanging out for a couple hours.  I had a generator at my house, so, uh, as the power loss went longer and longer, 
[02:43:30]  I started hooking more and more shit up.  Right.  Because I'm like, ah, first night, ah, as long as I got this and this, I'm fine.  And then you'd realize by the end of it, the generator's going,  and every light in the house is on.  I got heat.  I got cable.  Yeah.  Getting gas was the problem, though.  I was going to say, how much gas did you go through?  I was constantly coming back home with just giant gallon, five-gallon, ten-gallon cans 
[02:44:00]  of gas, constantly pouring in.  I have survived.  Terrible.  Why?  Nothing happened to us.  Nothing happened to me.  Me neither, man.  The lights blinked in my...  He was in Cloud City over there on the left side.  In my building, it was rock and rolling.  We got a little seasick, but that's it.  But that was it.  What about you, Jimmy?  Nothing happened to you?  No, he lives pretty close to me.  Yeah, we live a block apart, and I mean, I was just afraid.  Are you by Kelly?  I was afraid.  I was afraid.  I lost control of my bladder.  No, I'm about 30 blocks from Bobby.  Oh, okay.  But did you get to meet Edie Falco? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  I'm just kidding.  I love...  Is she cool?  She's the nicest person you've ever met.  Of course you're going to say that.  No, but I'm telling you.  What makes her cool?  How about that?  What makes her cool?  She's the most down-to-earth person.  She's from Long Island.  I like people that float.  What part of Long Island?  Northport.  Oh, really?  She went to school with John Skirty, who played Lou in Rescue Me.  Lou!  Lou!  Yeah.  She's just so good, man.  She's a great...  I never saw Nurse Jackie.  Oh, she's great at Nurse Jackie.  She's great.  She's just great.  We were driving. 
[02:45:00]  We did...  I play a cop, right?  So I'm driving.  Oh.  She's in a cop car.  Cops and firemen.  I play the Secretary of State.  So I'm driving her home, and I have to ask her out on a date.  So I ask her out on a date, and I'm driving.  I deliver that line to the camera first.  I turn to look at her.  She's smiling and just beaming.  And the little guy in my head just said, you're doing great with this girl.  Oh, no.  She's acting.  I got yanked right out of the seat.  Oh, my God.  She likes me.  You idiot.  I know. 
[02:45:30]  That's like when the stripper smiles at you at the club.  You dummy.  You dummy.  She's at work.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It says in the script she's supposed to like it.  It says I'm supposed to paint her bathroom.  And then I realize her husband's a mobster.  Oh, wait.  She's tremendous, man.  That's funny.  Fuck, is she good?  The show is really good, too.  Did he get anything?  I thought it was good.  You got anything off her?  It's make-believe, you dope.  Oh, but I mean, for the show.  For the show, did you have a little bedroom scene?  For the show.  For the show, did you have a bedroom scene?  Did you have to get nude? 
[02:46:00]  Me?  I wouldn't subject to that.  Did you get to kiss her in the show?  Uh, she's my, she, I put her love interest in it.  Oh, wow.  Dish the dirt for Hollywood.  That's it.  Oh, it's like TMZ.  TMZ.  Do you kiss any of the naughty spots, though?  Oh.  Would you just settle down?  Whoa, we're just asking.  Do we get one of those ass shots like Leary always gave himself?  No.  Leary loves his ass.  My ass is not going.  Where you fucking walk into the bathroom from the bed and they show your ass?  They show your ass and make the shadow bigger in post. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, you got any Tums?  They're just walking in all sexy.  Let's talk about Leary now that you're not working with him anymore.  He loved the ass shot, didn't he?  Ah, he was great.  I used to love him.  We like Leary.  When he did, when he did the shows, it was great when he, when we would, he said, whenever  we'd done nothing with working the scene, he'd go, we're getting in a fight.  So we would just punch each other.  We got in, we got in two, I remember two, it's a stigley.  We had a whole scene, we were supposed to get in an argument in the office.  He goes, fuck it, come over to the desk.  And I just came over to the desk and we just started punching each other. 
[02:47:00]  What was the line you asked her out with?  Do you remember the line?  Oh, I don't, it was a while ago.  And did you, another question.  When you kiss.  Would you like to go out?  I think it was like a, go out to dinner or something.  When you kiss on screen, did you use tongue or do you not?  No.  Well, with you, I'd do something different.  It's a little bit of an open mouth though.  So it's not just like you're kissing Nana.  I don't, you know what it is?  It's nerve wracking.  I'm like, I got to go, God, I hope my, I ate like two boxes of frigging Altoids. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  I was terrified of bad breath and everything.  Man.  I didn't eat any vegetables for a week because God forbid, you know.  Tony Soprano had his lips there for the love of God.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Man.  Cool.  Showbiz.  Did you talk to her about the Sopranos?  That's all I would have done.  That's all I would have done.  That's all I would have done.  Jimmy, he's not even lying.  He was so good.  That's all I would have done.  In between takes.  Oh, God.  If she was running lines with somebody, I would have walked, I would just interrupt and go, 
[02:48:00]  that fucking argument scene you had with him is one of the most underrated acting moments  in the entire series.  You're great.  I'd love to get back to her life.  She'd be like, oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Have this guy removed from the set, please.  She was so good, man.  Yeah, she is.  And my mother's all freaked out because she can't find Nurse Betty on the DVR.  Oh, no.  Yeah, don't.  She can't fucking freeze.  She doesn't understand.  Yeah, don't let her.  No, that's not.  Who says hello, by the way?  Ah, tell your mom.  I said hi.  I haven't seen her in so fucking long. 
[02:48:30]  I know.  It's the same list.  You call up.  Hi, Ma.  How you doing?  This is what I made for dinner.  This is what hurts.  How's everybody?  And goes through the entire fucking list.  The entire list.  What's the joke, Harry?  Where's Foote?  How's your friend Foote and Jimmy?  Do you tell her?  Do you say that's not that fine?  Ah, they're fine.  It's none of your beeswax.  Everyone's fine.  Is he still on the radio?  Yes, he's still on the radio.  The church isn't mad at him?  No, the church isn't mad at him.  Not anymore.  Thank God.  I was looking through some pictures on the... 
[02:49:00]  You know John Glenn, right?  Not John Glenn, the astronaut.  John Glenn.  Good Times Magazine.  He's a guy from Good Times.  Yes, I like John.  And the music papers and whatnot.  His Facebook is loaded with pictures of bands from Long Island from the 80s.  Really?  So you're like, I'm going through stuff and it's like Swift Kick and fucking like old  bands.  Dude, it's hilarious.  I haven't thought about them in years.  It's like, remember T.C. Cross and fucking Broken Arrow and like Cintron. 
[02:49:30]  Cintron.  I remember Cintron.  There were so many of these bands and then I'm just going through them like, look at these  fucking guys.  And then there I am.  Where's this?  So let's go there.  It's John Glenn's...  Rotgut.  Was it Rotgut or was it As Is?  It was a Rotgut one.  I think there was an As Is one though also.  There's a picture of Joe Curry that came up that's fucking...  In a dress?  Of course.  Of course he's in a dress.  Does Joe Curry like to wear a dress though? 
[02:50:00]  For real?  I think for real.  It comforts him.  Yeah.  I think he's comforted by the dress.  Is he trained on straightaway?  Like not a cross-dresser, I mean.  I don't think he's a cross-dresser.  But he likes like Edward.  We've never discussed this before.  No.  I think he just...  You think he really likes wearing it?  I think he likes being outrageous.  I don't know.  He always seemed comfy in the dress.  I don't think he likes it.  I would really tell him not to wear stripes though.  Yeah, yeah.  It just doesn't...  Not flattering?  No.  He's got childbearing hips. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Did you find it?  Of course you didn't.  I don't see the official John Glenn.  Of course you didn't.  Did you put it on John Glenn's Facebook?  You were.  There you go.  See, when you're looking for John Glenn's Facebook, maybe you should put John Glenn's  No, that was an astronaut.  Facebook.  Holy mother of...  Get off of Feet.com.  Oh, look at you.  You're a creep.  Yeah, is she coming in?  She's not in a great mood.  Yeah, but we have to have the big reveal for Adam Farrar playing the live this weekend. 
[02:51:00]  That was good.  Thank you.  That was good.  Down here has it.  Because as we all know, Sam is not very...  Oh, there we go.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember him.  I like John.  He's been in the Long Island music scene forever.  I just forgot his name.  Yeah, I know John Glenn.  And then for a while, he owned Westbury Music Fair.  Sure, I remember him.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  I'm learning to talk.  All good friends with...  Oh, yeah, look.  Kevin Meaney.  There you are.  Wait, you're on the front of his page.  You're on the front page, Adam?  Yeah.  He's the main picture. 
[02:51:30]  That's hilarious.  It's John Glenn with Kevin Meaney.  Is that Kevin?  Is that Kevin James?  Kevin James and Adam Farrar.  Yeah.  Kevin Meaney's not from Long Island, is he?  I don't...  No, I think he's from Boston.  No.  Yeah, he just knows John Glenn, obviously.  Yeah.  I want to see Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You probably got to go to albums.  I got pictures.  You know what pictures I got?  I just found it because we moved a bunch of shit.  I found stuff from my college graduation.  John Anthony's on the water when you had to buy a jacket.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:52:00]  All right.  My fault is it.  I'm throwing a party.  I want you to be there.  I want you to look nice.  Look at Rob Bartlett all young and shit.  Oh, that is a young Bartlett.  Those are the old East Side comedy days.  I don't think this is the same John Glenn site.  I don't think this is the same Facebook one I was looking at.  It isn't.  He probably has one that's just dedicated to bands.  Yeah.  This is more of his personal.  Yeah.  He's got one with a shitload of albums in it and a fuckload of pictures.  And it was so funny to look through all these pictures of these 80s and 90s bands from 
[02:52:30]  Long Island that I totally remember.  And it's like, here he is at February's.  Here he is at Sundance.  Sparks.  Here's another band at Sparks, at fucking Cheers.  What was the place we did in Bayshore?  Remember the Bayshore gig we used to do?  It's Right Track.  No, the Right Track gig was at the other place.  Sparks burned down.  Yeah.  Ironically enough, right?  Yeah.  And then we're going to burn down again next week.  And Frank Cariola's place was?  Sundance.  Hammerheads.  Frank Cariola?  No, in Huntington.  Oh, Roxy.  Roxy, right?  Yeah, the Roxy in Huntington. 
[02:53:00]  New York Avenue?  New York Avenue.  I did a lot of games there.  Jesus Christ.  What was the place we did in Bayshore?  Remember we...  Fuck.  Bayshore.  God, I can't remember.  There was so many.  Drunk out of our minds, singing Elton John with Laird.  Oh, fuck.  Remember that?  Laird.  Laird.  I can't find...  You can't find it there, Sam?  Maybe you have to be friends to get all the stuff.  Maybe you gotta be friends.  Well, good luck with that, then.  I'm not his friend.  Good luck getting a friend.  You're full of turkey.  Yeah.  Well, it's there. 
[02:53:30]  Joshua.  I swear.  I was looking last night.  That was great.  Yeah, sure it is.  Well, why don't we take a break?  Adam Ferrara's here.  Certainly.  I hear he's building a house.  I want to know about that.  Oh, man.  Not building.  He was putting it back together.  He's putting it back together.  Yeah.  Well, we just redid the bathroom.  Oh, okay.  No, because it's out there on the other coast.  The chairlift.  The chairlift.  I thought you meant it got destroyed in the storm.  No, no.  You're over there.  Not over here.  I'm over here now.  Adam Ferrara on Twitter.  And today, tonight, obviously, tomorrow and Sunday  at Lovedy Live, West Nyack, New York. 
[02:54:00]  LovedyLive.com.  Dot com.  The O.P.D.A. 3 channel.  Oh, yeah.  On SiriusXM.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, my dick smells like Mimi Beardsley.

Have some pool-legged alcohol?  Oh.  You're a virgin, aren't you?  Smell these poppers.  Her name is horrible.  That's a real cock softener. 
[02:55:00]  Why don't you take care of my baby brother?  Oh, look.  His cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.  His cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.

[02:56:30]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Sirius XM.  It's the OP Retro Show.  That's exactly right. 
[02:57:30]  What's with this shit we're being brought back to today all day?  I would assume this is a song from 20 years ago, right, E-Rock?  That would be correct.  Yeah, we're on a 20 years ago kick right now.  How come it's all hip-hop?  How come it's all hip-hop, E-Rock? Comment.  You never get to play it.  Oh, okay.  Are you a hip-hop guy?  Not really.  I like old stuff, though. 
[02:58:00]  Old school.  Yeah.  Backspin.  I love backspin.  We got backspin on Sirius XM, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I listen to that one every once in a while.  What do they play this?  Oh, are we losing the opportunity here?  Hey!  Hey!  Oh, boy.  There she goes.  Are we losing the opportunity?  I'm sending Sal after.  Well, Sam's right outside the studio.  Oh.  She's so mad.  We just want to show Adam who the foot belonged to. 
[02:58:30]  Remember?  Oh.  Just the...  I swear we were going to leave you alone.  What?  Him and his fucking Hitler stash are killing me.  Oh, fucking stupid Sal.  Sal's fine.  His Hitler stash.  She owns the foot.  That's your foot?  Yeah.  You want to see him?  Wow.  I'm sure you've already seen him.  I saw him here.  He was horrified by the picture.  I was not horrified.  And we said...  I was not horrified.  It's not live, though.  It's like the Grand Canyon.  We said you've got to see who the foot belongs to.  Yeah, but I was not horrified.  It was just a foot.  It wasn't connected.  You know what he said? 
[02:59:00]  He said, that's one foot?  He was horrified.  Adam looked at your cleavage three times so far.  I have not.  I'm looking at the feet on the thing.  Why are you buttoning up?  I don't know.  You want buttoned after your show's done, I noticed.  Okay.  Because you were...  No, no.  Because I got hot in there, and then I put it back on, and then I didn't.  You're hot everywhere.  I forgot to...  Almost everywhere.  Very charming.  Oh, you're such a smooth talker.  That's how I did it.  Tequila sunrise.  Do you want a tequila sunrise?  Do you want a tequila sunrise?  Who wants to go for a ride in the woods? 
[02:59:30]  Should I switch?  Yeah, you should switch.  That's Jim's, Mike.  Oh, shit.  Would you have a tequila sunrise if Anthony made it for you?  A hundred percent.  It's the first time I wanted to smell my own seat.  Right now?  At a...  No, that used to be my thing at parties.  Tequila sunrise?  Because all the other guys would bring beers, and I would bring tequila, grenadine, and orange juice,  and I'd come out with a tequila sunrise, and girls would go,  Oh, what is that?  And I'd go, Oh, it's tequila sunrise.  Let me make you one.  And that was like my gimmick.  And then you'd roofie it.  And then I'd fucking fuck her in an asshole.  Oh, wow. 
[03:00:00]  Anthony.  I don't like that.  That's not right.  You don't like that?  No, it hurts me.  It hurts me.  That's all I needed to know.  At least you know.  It hurts me.  It hurts me.  Did you ever have one of those moments where you do it, and you go, Oh, it hurts, and you  hear him go, Oh.  Oh.  And he runs into the bathroom.  Oh, no.  That's never happened to me, Jim.  Oh, God.  And you realize it.  Clearly it's happened to you many times.  Was it one of those times?  Did you try it just like a little drunk?  No, I've tried it a few times.  I want to want to like it, but I don't.  Oh, man. 
[03:00:30]  I want to want to, you know what I mean?  It's like scotch.  I want to want to like scotch as well.  It's an acquired pain.  Yeah.  I know it can feel good, but I just, I can't.  You're using the proper lube.  Yes, it does.  I did it all.  This isn't lube, by the way.  No, that's not the lube I used.  It isn't cell block D.  It isn't lube.  Did he ever pull it out and say, Oh, look, there's a little Abe Lincoln hat on it?  That has never happened to me.  You're fucking going out.  Jeez, man. 
[03:01:00]  That's the foot.  That's the foot.  Let's see.  Is it the initial entry or is it the insertion or the high point?  What sector?  I think it's the high point.  Is it?  He's bottoming out?  The first time it ever happened, it was like, I screamed, Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.  Oh, man.  Sounds like someone was in your house.  Late now.  Wow, really?  Get out?  Get out, get out, get out, get out.  Have you seen the photoshopped yet?  Ass is like the poltergeist house.  Really?  With the photoshopped?  Yes. 
[03:01:30]  I'm the three's a crowd?  Monsters, Inc.  Because it's, they're assuming it's monsters.  It's not that bad.  I mean, they're bad, but they're not that bad.  No, they're fine.  More about your ass sex exploit.  Exactly.  Oh, sorry.  And you used the lube.  Yeah.  Now, is he well endowed?  Yeah.  Very.  Well, this is, I've tried it like three times.  With different size?  Yeah.  How about the white ones?  Now, were they, sorry.  No, I know.  So even the smaller ones hurt a little bit?  It just hurts, dude.  I just don't, it just hurts, okay?  It just, period. 
[03:02:00]  And don't act like I'm the first girl that's ever said that.  Hey, hey.  I'd go to the lines, man.  Not to me, but to other guys.  From you to you.  Ow, it hurts.  Get out.  Just, that's always what you're going to get.  Yeah, yeah.  I have another hole that's perfectly ready to go.  So says you.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm just saying.  When it hurt, did you yell uncle for more than one reason?  Uncle, uncle.  There's a comma.  No, it was not my uncle.  It was like, author, author, but not here. 
[03:02:30]  Do you know how much trouble I'm going to get in with my boss right now?  Oh, it was him?  I don't think he likes me talking about, I don't think he likes me talking about able  sex.  I don't know.  Who is your boss, by the way?  Kid Kelly.  He probably wants to do it to you.  Who the hell's that?  I've talked about him before.  I have no idea who anyone is in this joint.  He's the goat version of Bob Kelly.  Because you come in.  You come in, you sit in, you do your thing.  Kid Kelly.  And then you leave.  It's the Kelly I like.  You don't stick around to talk to any people and meet people.  Why?  He wants to keep you all squeaky clean for the morning mashup crew? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, I should try.  You guys should talk about this on the morning mashup.  I heard you're getting a little risque.  Get a little edgy.  They put you guys on in the bathroom, you know.  I know.  You're lucky.  They will not put us on.  Well, that's not shocking.  We don't get the bathroom.  Not shocking.  Nope, we don't get the bathroom crowds.  Not shocking.  I don't mind hearing the mashup when I go in there.  I don't take a shit.  Motivate you, right?  Does it help the process?  It's better than that jazz.  Yeah, but I laugh because it's such a different Nicole.  Oh, I know. 
[03:03:30]  That's not her.  That's not the real Nicole.  Here's what's happening today.  Hi, guys.  Hollywood.  Justin Bieber's car caused an accident.  Oh, it's terrible.  And I'm like, get out!  Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.  There's the get out ass sex girl.  And then on this show, she talks about anal sex.  Yeah.  Or lack thereof.  What's the new, what's the big entertainment buzz?  Yeah, give us a little segment.  Yeah, give us a little segment, a little entertainment.  Well, Chris, thank you.  Iraq, you got a little entertainment music? 
[03:04:00]  Of course he doesn't.  Of course he doesn't.  That's right.  You didn't know I would.  Oh, Iraq.  Is he even there?  I was pulling the line of the day.  Entertainment music.  No.  He's pulling line of the day.  How do you know one of these lines isn't going to be line of the day?  Yeah, man.  Why don't you do that during breaks?  Yeah.  Because I don't have time to during breaks.  Oh, you got to take your big shits?  Not you.  Oh.  I think the call drops a deuce and a half.  Have you taken a good?  Not today yet. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, man.  Are they good?  Yeah, they're good.  Oh, man.  Impressive.  I bet you in high school her nickname was Deuce McGillicuddy.  No, it wasn't.  Just made that up.  How come coming out is no problem?  But then going in is an issue.  And that was my question.  That was my question.  Why does it hurt so bad?  Did you ever look in a toilet?  A tunnel is a toll one way.  Right.  You go against traffic, you're going to get hurt.  Do you ever look in the toilet at the log and go, I should be able to take that?  And then you try to shove the log back in?  Jim, that's not what I say.  Oh, man.  What a disaster. 
[03:05:00]  Irak, are you ready with some entertainment music?  What?  You don't know why.  Irak, what are you doing in there?  There we go.  Holy shit.  Nicole, do you got a little entertainment news for us today?  Oh, I like that.  Yeah.  Nice and cheesy.  Chris Humphries is trying to claim that this baby that is in Kim Kardashian's belly is actually  his because he's still married to her.  So he's trying to take the credit for that.  Oh, not biologically. 
[03:05:30]  Now, is Chris Humphries, does he have a legitimate gripe or is this just a bunch of sour grapes?  What?  That's how they talk to each other.  Does he have a legitimate complaint or is this just, you know, him being bitter about it?  I think he's just being bitter.  Is he obsessed with her, do you think?  I don't think he's obsessed.  I think he's trying to get back at her.  I think he's bitter.  Yeah, he's pissed off that he was used.  That he was used.  Exactly.  What's the first word do you think of?  What's the first word do you think he thought of when he heard who she was dating?  I don't know. 
[03:06:00]  I do.  Okay, what was it?  I'll yell it 20 times on my drive home.  Okay.  That's right.  Oh, God.  You're going to hell, Ann.  What?  I mean, I'll be there with you.  That's okay.  I got a VIP section and everything.  Exactly.  They all have feet like you in hell.  That's the punishment.  Also, Lindsay Lohan said that if she was going to be...  Yes, we're moving on.  We've got lots to get to.  Lindsay Lohan said that if she were to be a teacher, the class that she'd want to teach  would be ethics.  Now, that's just silly. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, but she said it like this.  If I'm going to teach ethics, it's ethics.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  She had to say that.  Did you lose it?  No, it's just you're from the mashup and you're here and I don't want to say a dirty word.  You can say a dirty word.  You should have shoved shit back in your ass and now they're shy.  She should be teaching cunt bowling.  Oh.  That's sweet.  You said it was okay.  When you pick the ball up with your flaps and you roll it.  All right, one more story.  Okay, Kelly Clarkson says she wishes that she was a lesbian because so many hot girls 
[03:07:00]  hit on her all the time.  She gets hit on by hot chicks all the time.  That means she's a lesbian.  No, she says she's a non-practicing lesbian.  She's engaged.  She's not a lesbian.  How come girls are always doing that whole lesbian thing?  Like, oh, she's pretty.  Oh, I wish I was.  But guys, not so much.  Because if a guy is never bisexual.  If a guy says he's bisexual, he's lying.  He's just gay.  He's gay.  You think he's just a peter pumper?  He's a peter pumper.  Whatever that means.  Yeah, he's a peter pumper.  They'll suck dicks. 
[03:07:30]  All right, enough about my ass.  All right, get out of here before I keep telling you it's mad.  Thank you, Nicole, with the entertainment report.  And the nice feet.  Have yourself a good weekend.  Oh, damn.  That's nice.  As Nicole walks out.  Everybody, look at your water cups.  Touch the ripples.  Look, she has no ass.  No, she does have an ass.  She has a set of fucking hooters, though.  She left her bag in here, so she's going to have to come back.  Let's see when she notices. 
[03:08:00]  Put the bag of grapes in.  There she is.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Not yet.  Let's see.  You put a bag of grapes in.  Now, she's got her coat.  She's running.  And she's probably thinking, like, when is she going to notice?  You're shoving grapes in.  But don't get them on her purse.  That's hilarious.  That's cool.  Oh, she's slowing down.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  She's like, I think I forgot something.  Oh, okay.  There it is.  She just touched her pockets.  Wait.  She's still going.  No, no, no.  She's touched her pockets.  All right.  Now she's coming back.  All right.  Let's make believe we're turning her foot around. 
[03:08:30]  She touched her pockets, like, where am I?  And then she realized, oh, they're in my purse.  It's like, where's my purse?  But it looks like she's trying to walk in skis.  She's now running.  Yes.  In a panic.  So make believe that.  So Adam Ferrara is going to be at Lovedy Live tonight, Saturday, and Sunday.  LovedyLive.com.  That's in West Nyack, New York.  Oh, what's up?  Hello?  Your bag.  Oh, you got your bag?  Oh, man.  Have a good weekend, Nicole.  You too, guys.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Good sports.  Love you.  Hey, Adam wants to show us something from Tom.  No. 
[03:09:00]  There's fucking grapes.  Wait.  We shoved a shitload of grapes in our bag.  And a lot of them, too.  There's a shitload of grapes in our bag.  How fucking infantile are we?  You're a girl.  Put grapes in her bag.  It's so stupid, but it's so funny.  It's all we have time for.  We have a whole shit in it.  It's ridiculous.  There's wine in my bag, you idiots.  Adam, we didn't even get to talk about Top Gear or anything.  You're going to show us a video.  What's this video?  Oh, this is if it loads.  This is we did a...  We went through the Moab Desert and rent a cars.  I did that. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Not rent a car, but I went through Moab.  What were you driving?  No, I had an SUV.  What's the big deal driving there?  It looks cool as fuck.  It's a roadrunner cartoon.  You're driving in a roadrunner cartoon.  There's a monument.  They got the arches.  Yeah.  And they got that big fucking...  It looks like a golf ball on a tee.  Mm-hmm.  It's a big fucking thing.  You drive through the big mountains and stuff.  Yes.  It's fucking cool as shit.  It looks like prehistoric.  Yeah.  So we get to the end of it. 
[03:10:00]  We have to get our cars down a hundred foot cliff.  And this is what I come up with to get my car down if it's loading.  Did it do the low?  Let's see.  He's going to do it for us.  Okay, Peggy.  Oh, no.  Looks like the opening to Quincy.  Oh, no.  Quincy.  You're going full...  Okay.  You're pushing it.  Oh, on a hang glider.  Yeah.  It's a Mustang with hang glider wings on it.  It's supposed to land on a bouncy castle.  Push it right over.  Oh, yeah.  This will work.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[03:10:30]  Godspeed, Peggy.  Fly!  I don't think you're getting much lift.  Oh, wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Don't hit the Lincoln.  Holy shit.  Holy shit is right.  Wow, right on the fucking mark.  But I hit the bouncy castle.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Yeah.  Dude, that's great.  You got a cool job.  I did that once.  No, you didn't.  Wow, you hit the bouncy castle. 
[03:11:00]  That Mustang is trash.  Yeah.  I got the grill in my garage.  You should have done that with the fucking race car that you drove for 12 feet.  Yeah, the 11th race car.  Yeah.  That thing flipped.  That did like an 18 flip.  It was great.  He thinks it's fine.  That's your job.  Yeah.  Silly.  Great clip.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page.  That's pretty good, man.  Good job, Adam.  That was cool.  You got a lot of fans from that show?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's nice.  They come out to send me pictures of their cars and stuff. 
[03:11:30]  It's really cool.  Were you hoping that the wings weren't going to bust off before it hit that fucking ledge,  though?  I was hoping.  I was looking.  I'm going, oh, they're losing the wings.  As the wings were going to go.  Because originally, the idea was I was supposed to ride in the car in a hot air balloon and  just ride past them.  But we couldn't afford it.  So he said, we don't have the budget for that.  What else you got?  I said, all right, put a hang glider on it and a parachute.  We don't have money for a parachute.  All right.  A bouncy castle.  Fine.  That's cheap enough.  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucking cool.  Yeah, it was fun. 
[03:12:00]  Hell yeah.  We might be close to line of the day.  Line of the day.  Well, E-Rock's been working feverishly.  Sure has.  Yeah, and by feverishly, we mean sick and slow and hot.  The bad smelling bag.  I don't have time.  Put on 80s hip hop.  Comment.  Very busy.  Comment.  E-Rock, please, quickly.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, what do you got?  Comment.  I got line of the day.  Do you notice the new E-Rock delivery on everything?  It's a new year. 
[03:12:30]  It's a new year.  It's that disgusted E-Rock.  We were talking to him either Wednesday or Thursday, maybe yesterday, the day that he  said, relax.  Yeah.  Relax.  About his new sort of, not only does he not give a fuck, but he's just content.  This is what it is, and he doesn't give a fuck.  It's the E-Rock for the new year.  Are you wearing one resolution?  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm not going to take work shit anymore.  Yes.  I'm going to be true to me.  Hey, where are we at with our walls? 
[03:13:00]  We haven't brought it up on the show yet.  Which walls?  We made it perfectly clear.  We want these walls.  They got rid of that dumb Martha Stewart channel, and we want to take over their space, which  is right behind us.  Yeah.  Well, they said they're going to look into it, and you know what that means.  They're going to kick it upstairs.  You see this coat rack?  They looked into that for a year and a half.  Yeah.  No joke.  And it's finally here, though.  Right, yeah.  Hey, do you see how that square piece of material for the wall is against it, flush? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was hanging off for a good six months.  Yeah.  They were looking into that, too, until somebody pressed it back on the wall.  Ah, those lights.  Two years.  Two years to look into.  Well, I think that the coat rack...  But they're looking into the walls.  Yeah.  But what?  They don't give a fudge.  Oh, no.  I think the coat rack is going to be obstacle one, because they'll be like, well, we would  tear down the walls.  But where do we put the coat rack?  What would we do with that coat rack?  That could be a problem.  Ah, we put a coat rack up.  Yeah.  You know, do you want things, or don't you want things?  Man, there will be no wall to hang your coat on. 
[03:14:00]  They take these walls out.  We take over the Martha Stewart old space there.  And this space.  And this space.  How big is that space?  About as big as this one.  That means we get to bring listeners back into our show.  Yeah, we do the live audience.  Live audience.  That's what we're gunning for here.  That's fun.  But they're looking into it.  What do you think the odds are that it happens?  Zero.  In our lifetime?  Yes.  I think if Ethel works on Fred, maybe the landlord will have to put it in.  Will-ah!  They hated each other.  Oh, yeah.  And they got rid of those two channels, unfortunately. 
[03:14:30]  Ethel and Fred are gone?  I remember Ethel and Fred.  They were great little channels.  God, that was a while ago, those channels.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, they're working on the walls.  Okay.  Yeah.  And we got new owners.  Liberty Media, welcome.  Welcome, Liberty Media.  Please don't fire me.  Oh, yes.  They announced that they took over.  They're based in Nashville.  We'll all be performing next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Wow.  There they are.  Didn't see that coming.  At the Zanies.  There's a Zanies in Nashville?  Yes, there is.  All right.  Have you been in Nashville before?  I'd kill there. 
[03:15:00]  Oh!  Ooh!  Ten years.  And Adam Farrar, Levity Live, West Nyack, starting tonight.  Great comedy club and a great comedian.  Perfect.  Love Adam.  And their food, by the way.  Food's good.  As far as comedy clubs go, the food is really good.  Sorry, Vinny.  I think Levity Live's got you beat on the food.  They got some kind of pizza nachos.  They're delicious.  Really good.  Who's are they?  I had the shrimp Caesar salad last night.  What the hell?  Is that another foot? 
[03:15:30]  What are you doing?  No.  He's looking at my cock, by the way.  Jim, I think your cock has a toe.  It's got a beak like a squid.  How many runner-ups today there, E-Rock?  Two.  Two runner-ups.  How many runner-ups?  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  When I'm ready, I'll tell you.  Relax.  Here's the first runner-up line of the day.  Who is your boss, by the way?  Kid Kelly.  He probably wants to do it to you.  Who the hell's that?  I've talked about him before.  I have no idea who anyone is in this joint. 
[03:16:00]  He's the goat version of Bob Kelly.  Because you come in.  You come in.  You say you do your day.  No, but you missed Anthony's line where he goes,  that's the one I like.  Uncle Paul.  That's Kid Kelly.  But does he do line of the day based on the last 15 minutes of the show?  He did this yesterday.  He doesn't hear the whole show.  Exactly.  That's it.  He doesn't listen to the whole show.  He forgets.  So when he says, I got to get line of the day,  that's when he listens to the show. 
[03:16:30]  For the last 15 minutes.  Yeah, that's what you mean.  Still a good line at all.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  I have no lines.  Is that what it is, E-Rock?  No.  Maybe your funny shit was in the last hour of the show.  Oh!  That's a guy who don't give a fuck.  Fuck.  That guy don't give a fuck.  How do we come back from that?  Fuck don't give a fudge.  He don't give a fuck.  Work out.  Read more.  Oh, man.  Don't take bullshit from them.  Right.  Adam Farrar.  Levy Live.  The next runner-up line of the day.  And if I'm looking down like that,  I want to see the whole thing. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  And if I get to that foot and it's fucking gnarly,  it's going to fuck things up.  Oh, then go for it!  Jesus.  That just happened too.  Yeah, it did.  It's not really a...  Yeah.  We sucked for the first two hours, huh?  Two and a half hours?  Cut out carbs.  I pulled some stuff, but this was better.  And line of the day in the last 10 minutes.  He basically said,  shut the fuck up and listen to these lines.  That's right.  Who used to decide line of the day for this program? 
[03:17:30]  Well, it was a combination of like...  It was Danny and...  Fired.  Than.  Fired.  Fired.  Travis.  Almost.  Soon to be.  Soon, soon.  Oh, so it was like a combination.  Now we've put it all on E-Rock.  Yeah.  Sam, you can't help him with that?  No, it's his bit.  But why could you just say maybe this line?  It's his baby.  Because let me tell you something.  E-Rock, you like this being your baby?  I'll be honest here for a second.  He goes, not at all.  Can I be honest?  Sure, you can.  I don't think you're picking some of the best shit. 
[03:18:00]  Oh.  And I don't even mean me.  I don't care who it is.  I just don't think you're picking some of the best shit.  Well, what was a better line today?  I don't know because it's not my bit.  I don't know.  Want me to read you some that aren't in this rundown?  Yeah!  Read them.  Oh, gee.  Bobo Hamid.  Chip Juan Williams.  Nicole Diving Comet.  Pat S with one S.  Rhymes with M.A.P.  See?  That was a good one. 
[03:18:30]  Special word and an early thing from Sprout.  Aw!  Well, we like Sprout.  Gee, Eric.  Do you want to hear it, Sprout?  You bet I do.  Sometimes I'll just look at myself in the mirrors in the morning when I'm getting ready  and I'll just say, go get him, Sprout.  Aw!  It's adorable.  You don't like Sprout.  I hate Sprout as a name.  It doesn't make sense.  It's my nickname.  What happened?  That's your nickname for you? 
[03:19:00]  Yes, it is.  Well, he comes up with a lot of things.  That's funny.  We can't keep track of all of them.  Go get him, Sprout.  His personality.  That was funny, though.  It was funny, but these are like moments.  Highlights.  Highlights.  Well, we've always had that confusion with line of the day.  But we've always been able to pick a line of the day.  Like, that's funny, but the...  You're a cocksucking motherfucker is what we're saying.  That's bit of the day.  It's a whole bit.  Yeah.  Right.  Like Jim's saying, sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and say, go get him, Sprout. 
[03:19:30]  It's like the bit of the day.  But not the line so much.  That's what I do.  Well, let's see what he picks for a line of the day.  I understand the premise.  What's the slug line today?  High American.  It's the lug line.  Slug me.  Oh, Adam.  We have a new sponsor.  Who?  Mask.  M-A-S-Q-U-E, by the way.  Mask Sexual Flavors is the new way to foreplay.  Available in four tantalizing flavors.  These oral gel strips will be the spark to light your bedroom flame. 
[03:20:00]  Visit sexualflavors.com to purchase or find a retailer near you.  Yum.  Okay.  Vavavavu.  Yeah.  And the way you say it is just...  Yeah.  That's right.  Here's line of the day.  Right.  Here comes...  Are you wearing Uggs? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  How ironic.  Why is that ironic?  Perfect.  Dance party weekend.  Perfect.  That's a line.  That's the way it works.  It was me, which is the most important thing.  It was a line, and it was today.  Very self-contained, very quick, done, boom.  Very good.  That's a bullshit.  Mine should have won.  Which one was yours, Chipper?  When Nicole came in, I'm like, Biggins, what's that about your fucking feet or something? 
[03:21:00]  Jesus.  That would have been funny.  I want to thank Avro.  You'll get him next time, Sprout.  Yeah.  For stopping by.  Lovely lie.  Absolutely.  Coasey Adam, man.  He doesn't come around as often as he used to.  And he's going to fucking be on Goddamn Nurse Jackie.  Yes.  Yep.  He's going to have some fun.  He's going to kiss fucking Mrs. Soprano.  Yes.  You making the moulin now, or what?  You got some moulin?  You got some moulin?  I don't have...  You got some moulin? 
[03:21:30]  He's dating a mouly?  What?  Oh, I thought you said something else.  You got some of this now?  A little bit, a little bit.  Ain't nothing going on but to rent.  And Adam Farrar on Twitter, Top Gear on the History Channel.  I think that's it.  That's it, baby.  Something you want to add to that?  Jimmy in Nashville?  Jimmy in Nashville next weekend?  Yeah.  I have a whole thing on country western music that I'm going to do.  Oh.  Place goes crazy.  I bet.  Jimmy in the emergency room after the show? 
[03:22:00]  That's right.  You want to give us one line from your country material?  What's your line of the day?  It's just some of his material.  From country music.  He's got one.  Draw hat.  First time I heard of that, I tried drinking through the old darn thing.  The old darn thing?  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir.  It's After. 
[03:22:30]  Opie and Anthony Live.  Too much pasta last night, Opie?  Not everything has to be on the air, Sam Roberts.  Everything has to be on the air.  Why would me eating a lot of pasta last night be interesting for the after show?  Let's see where it goes.  That's what the after show is all about.  Nothing on the after show is interesting.  But it was me and Jimmy just being pals, and I'm like, yeah, man, I feel like a fucking pig  because I ate a lot of spaghetti last night.  Who cares?  Look at that.  A little behind the scenes on the Opie and Anthony show.  It is one of my things.  I make a homemade spaghetti sauce.  Of course, I use a jar sauce, but then I spice it up. 
[03:23:00]  You know why I could use the N-word with Samuel L. Jackson?  Yo, nigga, what up?  What up?  Opie, he didn't give you a pass.  Am I allowed to say that?  He has to say it first.  Oh, shit.  I just took a chance.  Django, man.  No, I call it Django.  I pronounce the D.  Django.  Who kid has to say it first?  Django.  No, we were talking about how Samuel Jackson called out that white boy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You played the clip, right?  What do you call him a white boy for?  Huh?  Don't call him a white boy just because who kid's in the room?  He's a white boy.  You're starting to blacken up a little bit. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, man.  So good, man.  I'm white, but I know how to talk to the black man.  Yeah, of course, man.  You guys got the pass, man.  Yo, look.  I got some cheddar in my pocket.  That's the paper.  No bank account.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, that's right.  It's called paper now.  No bank account.  It's called paper now.  I got a G in my pocket.  I'm serious.  Look.  This is what black people do.  Look.  See?  He got some paper.  What?  Hundes.  I have a bank account.  I don't even have that much in.  I have a bank account, but I have to act black.  Show me how cool you are.  Just give me a hundy.  You don't even care.  You don't care.  You don't care.  Give him back the money. 
[03:24:00]  I just gave him back.  He's a millionaire.  Multi, Sam.  Multi.  Who kid's got $1,600 in his pocket?  I just gave A.  Oh, you want to go.  I'll take it back.  See, now if you take it back, you're not as cool.  You know what?  But you're not as cool if you take it back, if I offer it back to you.  I'm a nigga.  You can have it, man.  See?  Look.  Give me that shit right now, Opie.  Buy a whore with that.  You give me.  Give me the $100.  I just got a hundred.  You don't need it.  I just paid for your dick suck, man.  Oh, what a.  See, but now I'm going to give it back, but not on the air, so no one knows.  Over here.  See, look.  Look.  Did I give it back or not? 
[03:24:30]  No one will ever know.  I gave A.  A hundred bucks and he gave it back.  What happened?  Over here.  Over here.  Hey.  You want it?  Give me the $100.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give me the $100.  Sal, pass me that $100.  He's supposed to give millionaires a hundred.  It's cool.  It's cool.  Sal, grab the $100 from who, kid?  Can I explain myself, Sam?  Sal, give me that $100 bill right now.  Because I'm going to show you right now.  Shut up.  I got two minutes.  Let me explain, Sal.  Opie did the white thing.  I'm going to do the black thing right now.  Right in the pocket.  Hilarious.  That's the true mega right there.  Amazing radio that was.  There you go.  Singo.  Amazing.  No, my point was, because I did a thing there. 
[03:25:00]  Fucking Samuel Jackson is talking on the white reporter, and he's doing the N-word.  So Samuel Jackson calls him out and says, say the word.  He said it, though.  But I would have said the same thing to Samuel Jackson.  But then if he calls me out, then I would have definitely said it to him.  Exactly.  Right?  Total reversal.  Nothing wrong with that, though.  It's normal.  The N-word is normal now, right?  That's what we're going for?  Well, it's peppered into.  You guys got the pass, man. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, it's all good, man.  Thank you.  Oh, we do have the pass?  Yeah, you got the pass, man.  Because I did get scared.  But I did use the GGA version.  Oh, yeah.  As long as you don't say the ER version.  You can't say the ER?  No, that's the racist version.  What if you're quoting Django?  Well, then it's okay.  Okay, then it's okay.  Yeah, it's a movie.  It's a fucking movie for Christ.  It's a slave movie.  What the fuck do you expect, man?  Right.  All right, I'm odd man out, because I know you guys are butt buddies.  Yeah, we're gay on this show.  We are.  We're very gay.  But it's okay.  We're down low, is what it's called.  Odd man out.  Oh, man.  It's called down low, right? 
[03:26:00]  Who could?  That the Django shit is like popping right now.  It's Django.  Yo, nigga, what up?  My nigga right here.  He actually, and the way he said that was so perfect.  It's like, he's like, he knows black people that way he said it, man.  Do you think you could use that, Eric Clayton again?  Yo, nigga, what up?  I need that for my show.  Could you use that on a mixtape?  Yeah, oh, yeah, mixtape, intro, everything.  50 Cent, Opie.  That's all you need, too, because in hip-hop, what they'll do is they'll take an artist or 
[03:26:30]  a celebrity or whoever, and they need to record one thing, and all of a sudden, they're hosting  a mixtape.  So with that audio, Opie's hosting a mixtape now, right?  That has to be an intro on the next G-Unit mixtape or something, man.  What would the intro be?  Yo, nigga, what up?  Digger, what up?  Where's the Samuel L. Jackson clip?  I want to play it for Who Kid, just so he knows what Obi's talking about.  It's amazing how all this jingles shit is popping off now. 
[03:27:00]  Where'd you put the CD's sound?  I was talking to you.  He doesn't like, we've had problems with the sound before.  You're like a nigga right now.  He's just pacing back and forth.  Samuel L. Jackson clip.  God damn it, Who Kid.  I got to whip these white boys into shape.  You know what I'm saying?  Reverse slavery, man.  If I was a black guy, they'd be afraid of me.  Throw some cotton on this guy, man.  Sal's been in the house for too long, kid.  Yeah, Sal's surviving it, though.  Look at that look right there.  Listen. 
[03:27:30]  Got a little Hitler mustache, too, man.  It's a little spicy right there.  All right, Sal.  Get to the microphone.  Is this finally enough?  Is it enough?  How many people have come up to you and called that a Hitler mustache?  Yo, I swear to God, I got an Instagram mustache, man.  Yeah, we did it yesterday.  Oh, did you?  And I said how terrible it was.  It's so spicy.  I don't know.  What does that mean, spicy?  First of all, Sal said thank you.  Sal, what does spicy mean that you said thank you?  It sounded cool.  I don't know.  Okay, you don't know what it means.  I have no fucking clue.  What does spicy mean?  It's like an uncontrollable situation to black people. 
[03:28:00]  Anything that's spicy.  It's just uncontrollable right now.  It's spicy.  Like, that's unexplainable what's going on in your face right now.  You need, like, the X on your shirt or something.  I don't know.  You're saying this.  A swastik on your shirt or something.  No, no.  It's a very questionable mustache on your face right there.  Right?  It's not.  It's not.  Well, now who kid is saying it's Hitler-esque?  It's like Blitzkrieg or something.  I don't know, man.  There's just some German shit going on on his face right now.  What happened?  You didn't shave it down?  You didn't trim it?  No, I did.  It was more Hitler-y the other day, so I went and got it done. 
[03:28:30]  It's like a brawn commercial.  You need to be the brawn.  We're sitting here talking about Django, and apparently somebody's still on his inglorious bastard shit.  I know, man.  Damn, man.  Yeah.  You're on some Brad Pitt shit right now, man.  Shoot your ass, man.  Do you think it's a little Nazi-esque?  Yeah, a little bit.  Do you think maybe we lose it now that who kid is coming in here un-provoked?  Unprovoked.  That could be a word I'll use.  If I was Jewish, I would kick your ass. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, fuck you up.  The Nazis didn't like black people all that much either.  Yeah, I would fuck him up, too, but I think Jews deserve to kick his ass right now.  Yeah, you want to save that ass beating for the Jews.  No, I'm going to let it grow in and then shape it so it's a little more appropriate.  What about shaping mustaches?  Is that a little-  Is that a little spicy?  I mean, yeah, you got to say, I trimmed it down.  I was with Miss USA last night in the club, so-  What?  Yeah, we went out last night, you know what I mean?  What were you doing with Miss USA?  I mean, you know, I was showing her the moisture out there. 
[03:29:30]  Did she give up the ass?  Nah, she didn't give up the ass, you know.  Just some pussy?  She thinks my dick is dirty, so-  Okay, but she saw it.  No, I didn't see the pussy.  No, did she see the dick?  Nah, I didn't show her the dick, though.  I know she had no panties on, though.  You do?  And it was cold.  Is that how you could tell?  It's like, it's cold in here.  Nah, she sat in VIP, and her legs was up, and I saw it.  You did?  Mm-hmm.  What was the hairstyle like?  No, she just, nothing.  Nothing?  Shaved?  Shaved.  Was it a puffy one, or a-  I think it was a slit, like- 
[03:30:00]  Just a little slit.  Like a Gillette went, su-ha, su-ha, su-ha, su-ha.  This is what-  Su-ha.  Su-ha.  This is what Opie was talking about.  It's a reporter in Houston, and he's interviewing Samuel L. Jackson about Jango.  Yeah, yeah, watch how Samuel L. Jackson, just some, like, local movie critic in Houston,  listen to how Samuel L. Jackson responds.  There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the usage of the N-word in this movie.  No, nobody, none. 
[03:30:30]  The word would be-  Oh, I don't want to say it.  Why not?  I don't like to say it.  Have you ever said it?  No, sir.  Try it.  I don't like to say it.  Try it.  Really?  Seriously?  We're not going to have this conversation unless you say it.  You want to move on to another question?  Okay, awesome.  I don't want to say it.  Oh, come on.  Will you say it?  No, fuck no.  It's not the same thing.  Why do you want me to say it?  They're going to bleep it when you say it on your show.  Say it. 
[03:31:00]  I can't say it.  If I say it, this question won't make air.  Okay, forget it.  Okay, I'll skip it.  Sorry, guys.  It was a good question.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't a great question if you couldn't say it would.  All right, who can?  You've heard the clip now.  You know what I love?  You should have said it.  Of course you should have said it.  What's the big deal?  But because he was so scared, Samuel L. Jackson, not only did he take the word back, but he  actually changed the situation so if there was any N-word between those two, it was that  white guy. 
[03:31:30]  It sounded to me like Samuel L. Jackson made that white guy his N-word.  Did he not, Hoekie?  Straight up, man.  He gave him the pass.  He gave him the little comfort, you know?  Not only did he give him the pass, that was Samuel L. Jackson yelling at you going,  say it!  And that guy is like the typical white guy.  His voice was so white.  His actions were white.  Well, I don't like to say it.  The white reaction was at 100%.  And you're going to tell me this guy's got to be in his 30s.  That's the white reaction, I'm telling you. 
[03:32:00]  He's never said that word before.  Come on, man.  I mean, who could?  I've said that word a dozen times to your face.  It's in every white person's DNA to say it.  It's like, you know, there's a little racism in everyone.  Of course.  I got racism in my dick, too.  You do?  I mean, you want to be a white man.  Yeah, I don't want to fuck black pussy, you know what I'm saying?  Right, right.  That's my racism.  Right, that's your own personal racism.  Let's go to 318.  Excuse me.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  DJ Who Kid is here.  Yeah, what up?  What's up?  What up, my nigga? 
[03:32:30]  What up, my nigga?  Hey, Who Kid?  What encouraging all these white people.  Go on.  I know, too.  I'm from Louisiana, so it probably even comes out a little bit racist.  Damn, man.  Yeah, you do have a little racist spiciness to you.  There's some spiciness.  Go ahead.  Hey, Who Kid, I want to know if I could get an autograph.  Of course.  Are you the same guy who asked last time?  Hey, no, not at all.  No, no.  I was wondering maybe if he'd throw it on one of them hundos and drop it in the mail.  Let's do that. 
[03:33:00]  You just got it like that, huh?  I got it, man.  I got like two Gs, kid.  No bank account, sir.  That's it.  That's it.  Yo, we didn't Instagram how much money is in my pocket right now.  All right, all right.  Hang on.  I've been Instagramming all week long.  There's some nigga shit right here.  Let me take a photo of you, then.  I have to show Anthony how much money I have.  I got all the mics on, so let me go over there.  Take out that money.  I'm going to take out my phone.  I hope he wasn't here.  I would have to give away another lunch.  Show off all that money.  This is what I have.  Hang on.  Hold it up, because I want your face in there, too.  This is what I do every day. 
[03:33:30]  Hide that 50 so it looks more impressive.  Oh, yeah.  Let me take the 50 out.  That's on some, you know.  There's another 50 in there.  Hide those shits.  Hide those shits out there.  Just hundos.  Just hundos.  Yeah, man.  Benjamin Franklin, kid.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Fuck Abraham Lincoln, kid.  Fuck Lincoln.  Abraham Lincoln.  Fuck him.  That's a five.  Exactly.  Oh, fuck Abraham Lincoln.  Fuck him, yo.  I've seen that movie.  Fuck that movie.  He's a nigga.  A nigga lover.  That's for you white people out there.  Yes.  Unfortunately. 
[03:34:00]  There's a lot of niggas shit going on.  Abraham Lincoln's going to have an Academy Award.  Yeah.  The Django is popping off right now.  I think it's Django.  I think.  It's the Django.  All right.  Whatever you say.  Whatever you say.  I don't want to correct you.  I saw it, though.  I mean, it's supposed to be like the racist part of the, you know.  It was like a racist era.  It was like the slavery time.  It was the most racist era.  Yeah, but I didn't know that, you know, slavery was around with cowboys, though.  When you.  Yeah, you didn't know the shit.  I didn't know that.  You didn't know the slaves became cowboys? 
[03:34:30]  I didn't know that shit.  That's just.  That's some new shit to me.  When you watched it, did it strike you how many times the N word was used?  Or did you just say.  No, it was.  It makes sense.  It's in context.  It's like a movie.  It's not like, you know, it's not real life where a dog is chasing me and biting me and blood is being splurred.  Right, right, right.  On TV, like the news.  It was a movie.  Right.  I mean, you had like gunfire and women were flying across the room because they got shot.  It wasn't real life.  I guess some. 
[03:35:00]  I guess black people are annoyed because of the suffering their ancestors went through.  Well, Spike Lee won't see the movie.  Did you hear about that?  Why?  Spike Lee says he won't see the movie because he says slavery was not a spaghetti Western and it would be disrespectful to my ancestors.  What Spike Lee said to go see that movie.  But he's the king of touching like anything that's like racist or like he started that shit.  If that's the case, shouldn't Italians be mad at do the right thing?  Yeah, exactly.  You know what I mean?  It should be reversed.  It should be a picket sign at the Nick game. 
[03:35:30]  The Nick game.  This little nigga.  Get the fuck out of the front row.  Burn that nigga.  Pizza time.  Plus, I'm going to throw a garbage can through his window.  I mean, I don't think Spike Lee represented like the whole slavery movement.  No.  Plus, it seems kind of racist because Tarantino did like Django is for slavery.  What Inglourious Bastards was for the Holocaust.  Yeah.  I didn't see Spike Lee being like that's fucked up to the Holocaust. 
[03:36:00]  And I loved Inglourious Bastards.  It's like a good revenge movie.  Right.  Same thing with Django.  It's the same movie.  The guy got revenge and I thought it was cool.  Instead of killing Hitler, we're killing like slave masters.  That's the way it's supposed to be.  How can it be bad?  I feel like I'm in Haiti right now.  Right.  Who can?  As a black man.  Oh, man.  Do you not like sitting in a movie theater and watching Jamie Foxx put on a cowboy hat  and kill white people for two hours?  Well, as a man that used to be black, yeah, I loved it.  I loved it.  That was my early years of this thing here. 
[03:36:30]  You don't want to associate too much with you.  Okay.  I don't want my property value to go down.  I actually walked my dog with my hoodie on today.  You did?  Mm-hmm.  And that wasn't like a Trayvon situation.  I got a white person's mask.  You do?  Because my property shit, my house is like, what, 700 Gs?  I don't want it to go down.  When people see you in the neighborhood.  Yeah, I don't want it to go down.  So you have like one of the, what is that, set it off masks?  The plastic masks?  No, I got a white person's mask.  But it's a white person's face instead of the-  If you go to like any kind of Halloween spot, they got the lawyer, the teacher. 
[03:37:00]  So you walk around in a Ronald Reagan mask?  Nah, not Ronald Reagan shit.  My shit doesn't really go down.  I don't know.  Drew in L.A. or Louisiana?  That's a white world.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, we'll take either one.  But you might remember when Sam pulled over and pitched his pants?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you remember.  You were in here that day.  Yep, yep.  Yeah, yeah.  And I said, why don't you just pull open your doors and piss between the doors like a human being? 
[03:37:30]  Listen, it's true.  Like a real nigga would.  That's what I'm saying, man.  If we want to get back to the pissing, we can get back to the pissing.  But nobody was talking about that.  He wanted it off his chest.  He's been annoying him for the past-  What, my piss?  No, him.  Two weeks of the shit.  But he wanted my piss off his chest.  He's going to have to do more than make a phone call.  A hobo.  He hung up.  That's all he wanted.  Rick in Long Island.  Strong Island. 
[03:38:00]  What's up, Sammy?  Who cares, my nigga?  What up, my nigga, man?  You're making so much happiness to people.  Tango.  Tango.  Yo, nigga, what up?  What a way to end the Friday, huh?  Yeah.  What's up, Rick?  Where's my autograph, man?  I was supposed to get a ribbon with an autograph.  We signed it.  You never got that ribbon?  You see what I mean about this guy, Sal?  That's crazy.  Sal was in here, not giving me my CDs.  I thought it was weird.  I signed a fucking ribbon, which was so random. 
[03:38:30]  And you should have been-hatted by now.  Yeah.  I want my man maybe today.  You guys have a great weekend.  Love you guys.  All right, my nigga.  Peace.  And you should have been-hatted.  It's Blackspeak 4.  You should have had it.  They used to add in the bins sometimes.  Should have got it, nigga.  Yeah.  Yo, man.  This is a wild fucking show, man.  We'll go to-  We'll take a couple more calls before we move on.  2-1-4.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Nigga you.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, I want Senior Law to do the weather forecast.  Who? 
[03:39:00]  That's what that should be.  That's the character he-  3-0-  I don't know what he's talking about.  3-0-3.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  What the fuck was that?  Jimmy, Sam, I wanted to let a new kid know that walking around a neighborhood in a Mike Myers mask will lower the property.  Walking around, you know, with a-  Because you're from Haiti, too, so you probably have one of those giant knives.  But every time I wear the mask, the cops don't follow me.  They don't.  They give me donuts.  They say hi.  When I'm walking by myself, they follow me. 
[03:39:30]  What name do you go by?  I go by Mark.  Mark?  Mark my words.  Mark my-  Hello, officer.  It's me, Mark.  It's hard to talk white, too, but you guys are so delicate, man.  Well, we're working-  Who kid?  I mean, you think it's hard to talk-  Intricate, yo.  You think it's hard-  Intricate.  That's a beautiful SAT white word.  It's a relative.  But every time you come in here, you think it's hard to speak like a white person.  At least our language is in a book.  Like, you come in here, and it's a different word, a different meaning every time. 
[03:40:00]  You just learn the word spice.  Spiciness.  When does spicy become a thing?  We've been saying spiciness for years.  And Opie's in here being like, I got cheddar, and you're looking at him like, what the fuck  are you talking about?  I got mad guap, kid.  Guap!  I told you, when he said, I said, yo, this is the guap, kid.  Yeah.  The guap pocket.  Is guap still a thing?  Yeah, guap is still popping.  Guap is still popping.  It's guaping.  It's guaping right now.  That's right.  9-1-7.  9-1-7.  You're on after Opie Anthony White.  It's such a black show today, man. 
[03:40:30]  Very black.  Very black.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, you.  Hey.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's up, my nigga?  What's going on?  What's up with, something I need to know.  What's up with you guys always sweating the Italians?  Whether it's your rappers calling each other.  Oh, my God.  This is a scene from Do the Right Thing.  We didn't really sweat the Italians.  We kind of like, I mean, I respect the Italians.  I love them.  My best friend is the Italians.  I also found that we fell into a different category. 
[03:41:00]  When I hung with the brothers, I was allowed a little more leeway than the rest.  Yeah.  I mean, the Italians used to say the N-word all the time around me.  We used to call them N-words.  It was cool like that.  The Italians was like the closest to black.  Well, the next one would be Puerto Rican, but in our world, the Italians were black in  our eyes.  Because of the Moors.  And then for some reason, they didn't want to be called white.  I don't know why.  Why is there the Italians don't want to be called white when you look white?  We don't want to, when there's an application to fill out and you got to check off white,  black, or other, I check off other.  I mean, white, like what is white? 
[03:41:30]  What continent is white people?  European, right?  Where is Italy?  Europe.  You're white.  But they, but they consider themselves, I don't know.  Special.  They're like, yeah, but us Italians, we had it tough.  No, we never had it.  You guys get mad.  I'm like, you look white.  I mean, I'm not disrespecting you, but you do look white though.  Right.  But the problem is, it's, it's not something where you want to be lumped in category when  you have pride in where you're from specifically to a region. 
[03:42:00]  You don't want to be lumped into a general category when you have specific pride.  But Italians are like the most racist people ever.  And they don't want to get lumped into a specific category.  Well, that's generalizing there, Sammy.  That's pretty general of a comment.  So what, what, what color are you then?  Please answer this.  We prefer olive.  Oh my God.  They don't have the olive category.  Wow.  Nicole just brought me a Who Kid flavored cupcake.  Chocolate.  That's some black shit right there.  It is. 
[03:42:30]  It's actually called blackout.  Nicole, thank you for calling, buddy.  Italians are white people.  Nicole, are you sticking around or are you leaving?  She just brought you some black dick to eat.  It's not a dick.  It's a cupcake.  Oh.  Do you need me?  And I brought that for you even after you put a bundle of grapes in my purse.  Did you notice the grapes?  I just found the grapes in my purse.  Thank you.  Opie, Anthony, Jim, myself, we all decided to be extremely mature.  And when we saw that you had left your bag here, we went, oh, put grapes in it, put grapes  in it.  Why grapes?  Right?  It was so random. 
[03:43:00]  Super funny, right?  Because Jim, we didn't even open them out and like, Jim had a plastic bag of grapes he  was finished with.  We were like, let's put them in her bag.  So I went to go pay for my breakfast.  And then you pulled out grapes.  And I pulled out a big bag of grapes and they were like, uh, and I was like, uh.  So the joke went over like gangbusters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you put the grape in the person's mouth at Starbucks?  Did I put the grape in the person's mouth?  Like.  Nope.  Didn't.  Didn't do that.  Did you, uh, have you seen Nicole's feet?  They were a big part of today's show.  All right.  All right. 
[03:43:30]  You know what I did?  Enough about my feet.  What happened to it?  They're ugly.  They're not nice.  They're really bad feet.  Yeah.  I got corns.  I got ingrown toenails.  I got bunions.  Nicole's a beautiful girl.  They're big.  She's hot.  She's hot.  I can't believe you have corns.  White people would say this.  Nicole is hot is the word we would use.  You know what I mean?  What would you say?  What would a black person?  Off the heezy.  Right.  Would a black person, could you say banging?  Is that still something?  Yeah.  We still say banging.  Okay.  Banging.  Okay.  White bitch is banging.  You could say that.  She hot.  Right.  I like saying hot though. 
[03:44:00]  You do.  Why not?  That's because you want to be like a white guy.  Yeah.  You do.  I used to be black, Nicole.  I don't know.  I lost my color.  Somebody just said he's olive.  I didn't know Italians were olive.  Olive.  But I guess that's it.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Italians are olive.  Why not?  I would give you the rest.  I mean, I already ate half this cupcake.  You ate that shit.  You can have the other half if you don't care.  I mean, I don't have herpes or anything.  You sure?  Yeah.  That's a little hard to believe.  That's not hard to believe.  I've been tested for STDs every year of my life since I'm 16, since I became sexually active. 
[03:44:30]  And when you became sexually active, boy, did you?  You could.  Nothing would happen.  I might give myself STDs.  Yeah, you know?  It's super, super good.  Luckily, who is it?  Salted caramel cupcake.  Salted, though?  Salty and sweet.  Is it?  You like that shit.  You know why it's okay?  It's banging.  I follow...  It's like a sweet dick in your mouth, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Who, kid, is it?  Sweet and salty at the same time.  Is that what a sweet dick is like, who, kid?  I don't know, but that's what the girl told me.  Taste it.  Let me know.  You know when your dick is sweating and the chicks suck it?  That's what it is.  Oh, I see. 
[03:45:00]  So it's a little salty from the sweat.  I follow DJ Who Kid on Instagram, so I know what he's up to.  Yeah.  He's not going to catch an STD from you, Nicole.  No, not from me.  He's got them.  He's all checked out already.  He's got the STDs.  I'm about to catch it to myself.  Wow.  You should do something about that.  Just sitting here.  I mean, he's just passing disease in his own body.  He's been longer with STDs.  You don't know that?  Is that true?  My grandfather died when he was 101.  Really?  And what STD did your grandfather have?  Chlamydia in his mouth.  He had all that shit. 
[03:45:30]  He didn't even go for the cure.  He left it?  Left it.  Drunk coffee every day.  Wow.  I have a question.  What do you think about Sam's new hairdo?  I'm calling it the side part poof.  You see that?  It's like really exclusive.  It's a little...  I decided to just try it.  To just let a part exist on the side.  Right.  Sorry, part poof.  Because you know who else did that?  Frederick Douglass.  Who the fuck is that?  Should I know who Frederick Douglass is?  You graduated from college, right, Nicole?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, good to know.  Is that a president or something? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, Frederick Douglass.  The first black president.  Frederick Douglass.  Sure.  Yep.  You're both right.  See, we're both smart.  We both graduated.  You're both very good.  It's like you're like a nigga pet detective or something.  Yeah, man.  You think my hair looks like Ace Matura except the black?  Oh, my God.  It's like Curly is parted.  No, it's like pubes.  Cubes?  Who has pubes this long?  I mean, I don't know how many girls you've gone down on, but I've seen a few girls with  some seriously crunchy hair.  I mean, my number... 
[03:46:30]  I'm not going to give you a number, but I'm going to go ahead and say that you have actually  probably been with more girls than me.  I doubt that.  Really?  How many girls have you been with?  You can count, right?  Yeah, maybe like four girls.  Okay, so you have men with...  You ate them out, too?  Yeah.  So she ate more girls than you, man.  No, I didn't say that.  You don't know my...  She has not been with more women than me.  That's official.  No.  Well, she ate more girls than you.  No!  That's not me when I say been with.  You ate more girls than her?  Four?  Yes. 
[03:47:00]  Do you not like going down on girls?  No, I'm a fan of that.  Okay.  Holy shit.  I have gone down on more women than Nicole has.  Okay.  I've definitely banged way more dudes than you.  I'll bet so.  How many dudes?  I don't know the number.  How many figures are we talking?  Two or three?  Four.  Thousand?  No, dude.  I'm not that horny.  Are we talking two...  Are we still in two figures or have we moved to three?  No, we're in two figures, of course.  We're not...  We're in two figures.  Okay.  We're in three figures.  Jesus.  I don't know if you've banged over a hundred guys. 
[03:47:30]  It's since you were sixteen.  Never.  A hundred guys.  God.  How many of you do, man?  He's not giving his number, he said.  Eight, maybe.  It's small.  Seriously?  I'm like a thousand.  You are.  You're at four figures.  I'm like...  You're not at four figures, kids.  600, maybe.  Holy shit.  How many women do you realistically...  I've been on like three tours.  I tour with Eminem.  Right.  That's enough white bitches forever.  Because, Nicole, don't forget.  Who kid has toured with Eminem?  Yes, I just heard.  He's toured with 50 Cent. 
[03:48:00]  Yes, he has.  He's got all...  Diddy.  He goes all over the world.  Bahrain.  They love him in Bahrain.  What's Bahrain?  It's like, I don't know, some Arab pussy.  Yeah, exactly.  Arab pussy.  That's what I'm saying.  Sand pussy.  So, if you go...  If you're...  Say you're 22.  Yeah.  You go to see Eminem in concert, and Eminem is like...  Poppin', as who kid would say.  He's at the height of his career.  That's he's the nigga.  You see who kid on stage pretending to DJ.  He doesn't know how to DJ.  But he's using his sound machine to make record scratchings. 
[03:48:30]  I would definitely fuck him.  You would fuck him?  100%.  Randomly, too.  Yeah.  And that's every night for this guy.  Yeah.  So, how many do you think?  I guess like 700.  I don't know.  In the hundreds, though.  I got like at least 800 blowjobs.  And how many times?  You think you've had 800 blowjobs?  At least 800 blowjobs.  I haven't even had close to that many.  I'm sorry for that.  Not even close.  And by the way, I haven't had 800 blowjobs, period.  Even from the same girl.  Not even 800 different blowjobs. 
[03:49:00]  My dick has not been sucked 800 times by anyone.  Put it this way.  The Eminem tour.  The Jay-Z tour.  And let's say if there's 50 dates.  We did every state.  You got your dick sucked at least at every.  Jay-Z tour, you said?  We toured with Jay-Z also.  And were they all.  Is it like girls begging?  Like you have to be like, no.  Groupies.  So, they go to the back room.  And then that's like getting sex or head at the venue.  Not at the hotel.  Not after the party.  So, are they in line?  Yeah.  You work with Lloyd Banks, correct?  He has unlimited shit. 
[03:49:30]  Isn't Lloyd Banks the, didn't he do the song Groupie Love?  Yeah.  Constant sex.  He wrote a song called Groupie Love, Groupie Love.  That's the whole song.  Yeah, but how, like.  And Who Kid is just sitting there being like, okay, Lloyd busy right now.  Who Kid.  Wait, so, but don't you ever just like run out of spunk?  Like, aren't you ever like.  I mean, we get sleep.  We're on a tour bus.  Sleep it out.  10 hour drive.  We go to Nick City.  You're rested.  Your dick is up.  Bust a nut.  I just watched fucking Scooby-Doo.  A whole joint.  Like, my Scooby-Doo, like, rack set. 
[03:50:00]  Like, the whole.  Wow.  So, you watch Scooby-Doo to heal your dick?  Yeah.  It keeps it calm and smooth.  I understand.  And spicy.  Calm and smooth and spicy.  Yeah, because that Scooby-Doo stuff, that's a little spicy to me.  There's only one girl that got a picture of my dick, and that's it.  Who is it?  Who is it?  Some Asian chick.  Is it your wife?  Nah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Fuck her.  Because you do have an Asian wife.  Yeah, fuck her.  Fuck her, right?  You know that when I got in a really, really big fight with Matt?  Uh-huh.  Like...  Your husband. 
[03:50:30]  My husband.  Like, maybe a month or two ago, like, a serious fight where I was like, I hate you, I'm going  to leave you.  He was like...  One of the many.  Yeah.  He said, I'm going to sell those pictures I have of you.  Wow.  Like, Matt and I was like, you know, after we made up, I've been on...  I'm searching for anything I can find to delete.  What type of pictures are you talking about?  Naughty pictures.  Like, what type exactly?  Naked, doing it.  Like, just a little...  Just like you just showing a tit?  Big deal.  No, everything.  Spread eagle?  Yeah, man.  Everything. 
[03:51:00]  I've got to get rid of them before the next fight.  You took pictures for Matt.  General Hospital.  Spreading yourself.  There's just a...  There's everything.  Is there pictures of you in acts?  What that mean?  In, like, acting out actions.  Yeah, of course.  Fucking will say.  Because you would think you could trust your husband, but in the heat of a fight, he tried  to use that against me.  So while your husband's banging you, he's taking his phone out and being like, click.  Sometimes if we're, like, wasted enough. 
[03:51:30]  It's not like it's something we do all the time, but there's a few pictures he has.  Get some booze in there.  Yeah.  And everybody's a photographer all of a sudden.  I think you should argue with him tonight again.  Told him you're leaving.  All of a sudden, he gets a couple shots of him and...  TMZ!  And you're fucking Annie Leibovitz.  When did this happen?  I hate you.  How many pictures does he have?  I don't know.  Just a few.  Not a lot.  Like, I mean, yeah, but...  Like a handful.  Handful.  Like maybe five.  Okay.  But they're, like, juicy pictures.  They're juicy pictures. 
[03:52:00]  And when I say juicy pictures, I mean you can see juices in the pictures.  Damn.  Just because Who Kid's in here, I'm going to say moisture.  Moisturizing pictures, Who Kid.  This is the opposite of Scooby-Doo we're talking about.  Okay.  This is the...  If you need to smooth your dick out and get spicy, do not look at these pictures.  Oh, I'm going to whack off right now.  You are.  I'm just thinking about it.  You are.  I couldn't believe it.  Indeed.  So you're talking about...  That's crazy.  You're talking about Spread Eagle photos.  Yeah, okay.  I don't remember what all the photos are.  I just know that there are some photos...  That's going to make it tough to delete them. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, but I got to find them because that was not cool.  And I told him it wasn't cool.  What's Matt at?  Matt!  Matt!  Matt!  Matt!  That's not cool, dude.  I think I have your...  You can text him.  Call him over here.  You can text him and tell him that that was messed up, that he threatened that.  Well, what if I text him instead and just be like, hey, we need a couple pictures for the show.  You would never do it.  Just some examples.  He would never do that.  Do it for O&A.  I have his phone number in here.  I mean, maybe it's like...  Maybe next time he's drunk, just be like, you should text Sam.  And we'll be texting.  And then when he's, like, fucked up, I can get him to send me some photos. 
[03:53:00]  It could happen.  That could happen.  She can show us a photo now, secretly.  I don't have anything else.  Do you have photos of your husband on your phone?  I wouldn't want to see that, though.  Not on my phone, no.  Where are they?  I am.  At home, baby.  You have them, like, on your computer?  Yeah.  Damn, you have a photo of your husband's dick, yo?  Yeah.  Well, you have a naked photo of your wife, correct?  When she was pregnant.  That's a long time ago.  That's the picture you have of her naked?  Pregnant?  Yeah, it's sexy.  You like that?  You like that shit.  That was, like, ten years ago.  Wait, did you do her, like, up until you almost had the baby? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Because I'm afraid when I get pregnant, he's not going to want to have sex with me.  No, we did it all the time.  You did?  I did it mostly.  It felt like I was fucking a balloon.  You like that.  And how often do you fuck now?  Never.  But are you buddies?  Yeah, we're friends, but that's it.  But fuck that bitch, right?  Why don't we get divorced if you don't love each other?  Cheaper to keeper.  Cheaper to keeper.  Does she know you feel this way?  Yeah, she knows I fuck bitches, man.  How could you not?  You're very public with that information.  That's why I'm going to fuck.  Happy New Year. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  Indeed.  I take it you didn't kiss her when the ball dropped this year.  Definitely not.  Did you kiss somebody or did somebody kiss you?  I was tonguing somebody.  You were.  Somebody else.  I love whoever I was with, but that was only for New Year's, though.  Yeah, you don't remember who it was.  I don't care who it was.  You loved them on that night.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Or as Dick Clark used to say, Happy New Year.  May he rest in peace.  Yes, may he rest in peace.  You can't make those Dick Clark jokes on the morning mashup, can you?  No, we made fun of the Happy New Year. 
[03:54:30]  You did?  Yeah, dude.  It was crazy.  Who says Happy New Year?  The man had a stroke.  That means it's time to mail it in.  The man had a stroke.  I have a lot of respect for Dick Clark.  And again, may he rest in peace.  But I mean, once you say Happy New Year, it's over.  Were there some family-friendly people calling in, like, how could you make fun of Dick Clark?  No.  Really?  So you got a little edge to your morning mashup show.  He had a penis name.  He did.  What was it?  Dick.  Dick.  He had a penis name.  I don't know.  How do I be able to accept that name?  How could you give birth to the kid? 
[03:55:00]  Yo, I'm going to name him Dick.  No, I mean, Richard.  No, I'm going to name him Richard.  Richard.  But then why do you decide that the nickname is going to be Dick?  Why can't it be Richie instead of Dick?  Who goes with Dick?  Well, it's like, you know, it's...  That's a good question.  There are rappers who have the N-word in their name.  You know what I mean?  And sometimes you want to take ownership of that.  You don't name your child Diggily.  So why would I name my white child Dick?  So you think, like, a dad, like, is holding the baby?  Look at this little nigga.  Yeah, that's the perfect name!  How many kids do you have? 
[03:55:30]  I have just two.  Do you love them so much?  I love them little niggas.  You know he named them after...  Ken and Ryu.  I'm sorry.  After Street Fighter characters.  For real?  That's a badass shit.  Ken and Ryu.  Really?  That's some real shit.  That's my favorite video game.  So it's just that my kids are half Asians, though.  Right.  And your wife was like, I don't want to name them after a video game.  And you were like, yo, fuck up.  I'm paying the bill, bitch.  So you're done with having...  Shut the fuck up!  I'm here with this shit. 
[03:56:00]  You're done having kids, though.  Nah, my balls are tied, kid.  Are you done having kids or done having kids with her?  I'm the pull-out king.  I might have a kid by mistake, but that's it.  Right.  You are.  That's your method of contraception.  You know pulling out does not work.  No, pull-out is like...  You could be a pull-out king.  You could be the pull-out king, but it doesn't mean that's going to keep the baby from...  Do you know that?  From personal experience?  No!  Okay.  I just thought...  I don't.  That's a risky question to ask, because I don't know if the answer is yes.  I don't want to ask the follow-up.  Never one abortion in my life, ever. 
[03:56:30]  Okay, good.  Now that that's off the table.  Never one.  You never had an abortion?  Never once.  I've had scares, but never an abortion.  Never.  Have you ever plan B'd it up?  Of course.  Yeah.  I mean, who hasn't?  Take those shits like Flintstone vitamins.  You never had an abortion.  I know, and I have tons of...  I mean, I have a friend who had, like, seven.  What?  Yeah.  You know her, too.  Love her.  Don't your insides get all fucked up?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's spicy, see?  Now you've got to bring the word spicy.  That's some spicy shit.  Are you learning from Who Kid?  I didn't know that spicy was a thing.  How do you have seven abortions?  How many abortions have you been a part of, Who Kid? 
[03:57:00]  Obviously...  Seven, maybe.  You're around seven yourself.  Yeah, but that's, like, years of, like, since high school.  And you always paid for them, right?  Yeah, of course.  Not in high school.  I paid when it was only a hundred bucks.  You used to know.  How much are abortions these days?  They're a little bit more expensive than a hundred bucks.  Ninety-nine, ninety-nine.  Listen to me.  He's like, back in my day when abortions were only...  Indian doctors.  The best.  Can I believe it?  Basement abortions.  Good old hanger. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, those are real cheap.  Yeah, dude.  So when you were growing up and starting abortions...  I mean, when I first lost my virginity at 19...  Yeah.  You lost your virginity at 19?  Yeah, everybody can't believe this shit.  It was a Puerto Rican chick.  I came in her, but I thought that you randomly get pregnant.  I didn't pull out.  And she got pregnant.  So you thought pregnancy just happened randomly?  It was her first time, too.  She was my neighbor.  And you were...  I don't want to switch.  Won't you be my neighbor?  Won't you be my neighbor?  So you were thinking, well, it's our...  This is why there's so many kids in the black community. 
[03:58:00]  Lack of sexual education.  I didn't know.  You were both thinking, we're virgins.  Yeah.  I could come all up in her.  I feel good.  And I let it loose.  And then she was like, oh, I'm pregnant.  I was like, what?  You got a girl pregnant your first time out.  First time.  And you were 19.  It was, I don't know, like 90-something.  I don't know.  So no wonder, Nicole.  He's making up for lost time.  Yeah.  I was 16, but I...  Even 16 is a little...  But I had pimples and...  You were a dork when you were growing up?  Yeah, I was Haitian.  I had no clothes.  I didn't have gap clothes. 
[03:58:30]  I didn't have nothing.  You were not cool.  You smell like body odor?  A little bit?  Yeah.  A little bit.  But I had mad pimples, though.  You did?  Chick's didn't want to bang me.  Mad pimples.  Fucked up.  I was looking like a walking pizza.  Why didn't you do proactive, dude?  You didn't have no Diddy Cream back then, yo.  Diddy Cream.  Take that.  Take that.  Take that in your face.  Yeah, I love that shit.  Okay, your skin is very clear now.  Yeah.  It's like moist and wet.  Right.  That must be from all the moisture that you've had on it.  Pussy juice. 
[03:59:00]  All the pussy juice is what we'll say.  So at what point did you decide it's time to make up for lost time?  Let's start getting some numbers up.  I guess when I was 24 and I became a DJ.  And that was it?  Became a DJ and I started banging random chicks and it was like, it's so easy.  So between 19 and 24, you were like, I'm just going to be monogamous.  It's just me and my girlfriend.  I worked at the airport, so there ain't nobody fucking me.  You worked at the airport?  Security guard.  Oh my God.  Look at how much we're learning today.  I love that.  You're working at the Port Authority as a security guard.  Yeah.  And everybody knows too now that you're pussy. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  So you must have been a terrible security guard.  What?  Man.  I saw, what's his name, what's his name from Cuba?  He came through the airport.  Fidel Castro?  Came through.  I was there when they landed.  He came out the tank.  No fucking way.  And I was in the box.  You were scared?  Fidel!  Fidel!  Right?  It was crazy.  Right.  That was the only excitement I had in that box.  And the rest of the time, I did crossword puzzles.  Crossword puzzles?  Oh, you were in one of those little boxes, like the subway people.  The Daily News joint was my favorite.  Yeah, you were just crossword puzzling it up.  It was niggery.  You know what I'm saying? 
[04:00:00]  I understand.  I understand.  New York Post is kind of hard.  I can't fuck with New York Times either.  That's just some educated shit.  Yeah, that one's hard.  That one's really hard.  He just said New York Post is kind of hard.  That one is hard.  New York Times is really hard, but New York Post is hard for me.  Wow.  Daily News is a nigger.  He's very cool for the Bible.  He's still struggling with Frederick Douglass.  That's the president, right?  Yeah, yes.  Can you tell me who he is?  It was Frederick Douglass and then Barack Obama.  It was the first black president.  No, for real.  Can I know who he really was?  I'm learning about Who Kid right now.  Sorry, my bad.  So, Who Kid. 
[04:00:30]  You had to get this girl aborted at 19?  Like, she had to get her an abortion?  Yeah, we went to the, I took her to the clinic.  Didn't that freak you out?  Your first time you're having sex?  You're like, finally.  All my friends.  First time.  Every, you know, finally I get to have sex.  All my friends have been fucking for years.  All the people who make fun of me have been fucking for years.  I finally get to bang this chick.  And I got to get an abortion?  Like, how do you even know how to do that?  She didn't even know for like weeks, too.  Also, like, you're like, no, I'm definitely pregnant. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, I was throwing up.  I thought I was pregnant.  I was throwing up.  Sure.  Getting cravings.  All of a sudden, I want peanut butter and ice cream.  Beats.  But then didn't that turn you off to sex for a little bit?  Sex is scary, man.  I wanted it, but I was still whacked.  I was still like, I have no gear.  You know, I finally got a job where I could buy a sneaker here and there.  Or maybe condoms?  I don't know.  They had condoms back then.  What does that mean they didn't have condoms back then? 
[04:01:30]  Yes, they did.  Yes, they did.  You didn't know about it.  I'm sorry.  You could ask Wu-Tang.  Any of those old rappers, El Coochie, there was no condoms back then.  If you ask Wu-Tang now, they would say, I said, he said, if you ask Wu-Tang now, they  would say, no, they don't make condoms.  Like, Ghostface Killer told me that they toured and there was no condoms.  There was O-D-B, no condoms.  There was no condoms back then.  They just pulled out, pulled out, pulled out.  No, they impregnated women.  Okay, or that.  Have you been into the projects?  Shit, man, but, you know, it's real.  I mean, I didn't think about that.  There was no sex education. 
[04:02:00]  Right.  Lack of education and, Nicole, obviously, there's something in the hip-hop black community.  They just get pregnant so fast.  Because they value sneakers over condoms.  But I think I'm against sex education because my son, I went through his Facebook, like,  I snuck in his Facebook, and a little 12-year-old wants to suck his dick.  Why don't you let it happen?  I didn't tell him, don't do it, but I was in shock.  I was like, yo, I didn't know 12-year-olds get their dick sucked.  What kind of shit is that?  I didn't get my dick sucked when I was 12 years old.  I didn't get my dick sucked when I was 17 years old. 
[04:02:30]  I didn't even get my dick sucked when I was 19 when I lost my shit.  I just got pussy.  Yeah.  I mean, I was with you there in high school.  Nothing was happening.  But 12 years old, like, kids are getting their dick sucked at 12.  You know what's happening?  You got to watch his phone because, I mean,  kids now, naked photos, like, I remember when I was in high school,  one girl emailed a naked photo of herself to her boyfriend,  and it got all over school, and it was humiliating, and blah, blah, blah.  Now, every girl in school is texting naked photos. 
[04:03:00]  Of course.  That's part of dating now.  I didn't know that.  It's like, first base is kissing,  second base is under the shirt, little boob action,  third base is blowjob in a sex message.  No, third base is fingering.  No, wait, third base is blowjob.  No, third base is fingering.  Fine.  Fingering for him, and then you give the blowjob that third base.  Right, right.  Sorry.  That's all I got when I was young.  Fingers, little, squeeze the butt and run.  Squeeze and just pinch a little butt cheek.  I used to go on a dude ranch, yeah, and run. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was, and I used to lie, yo, I got the ass, kid.  But it's like, I had to squeeze the ass.  So you'd lie to your friends and try to be cool.  Would they know you were a dork?  Uh, yeah.  Like, shut the fuck up.  Who can it?  But, yeah, but it's amazing.  When I got pussy from her, a lot of guys say they fucked her,  but she was a virgin.  People were lying back then.  Oh.  Back then, they used to lie.  Yeah, I mean, people were lying to their ass.  And now it's like, you know, I believe it now.  The little kids are fucking, but when I caught my son,  I caught my son to smoke a weed, like both of them.  How old's your other son?  12 and 11. 
[04:04:00]  You caught your 11-year-old son smoking weed?  My 12-year-old had the weed, and they got it from somebody in school.  I had to go to the school and be like, yo, the fuck, what the hell's going on here?  Oh, so you were being like a dad.  Yeah, but did the-  I wanted to know where he got that shit out.  He was good.  They had a little left, buddy.  Whatever.  I was going to say, did the school look at you, like, you come to the school,  where the fuck is my son getting weed from?  I didn't want to be a snitch on my kid, so he looked like an asshole in school.  So I went just to ask some questions.  Right.  To let them know that, you know.  A little reporting.  All right, but then, because of that weed shit, I went to his Facebook. 
[04:04:30]  I got his password.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's where I caught, like, these little girls.  Was it Blanca?  His password?  Huh?  His password was Blanca?  No, it was, uh, what was it?  Don't tell everybody your kid's password!  I can't say it on air.  All right.  But for me, snooping around, that's where I caught a 12-year-old.  I caught a 12-year-old.  You can.  I caught a 12-year-old.  I couldn't believe it.  Like, should I tell the mother that, that the daughter wants to suck my son's dick?  No, I think it's the kids are-  She's 12.  How about stop cock-blocking?  Yeah. 
[04:05:00]  I didn't want to be a sucker, because I don't want my father stopping me from sucking to  get my dick sucked.  Wait, no, what were you about- you were about to say for a second.  Who Kid's got some spicy thoughts.  No, no, no.  Was that good?  Spicy thoughts?  Yeah, that sounds good, but I'm not spicy, though.  Wait, did you yell at the kids for smoking weed?  I still haven't talked to them about it.  Well, you're so-  You know what I would- you know what?  If my dad was Who Kid, and he came in and he'd be like, Sam, what the fuck are you doing  smoking weed?  I'd be like, Dad, I want you to know something.  You're a horrible influence.  That's what I'm saying.  I hang with Snoop Dogg. 
[04:05:30]  My Instagram is out of control.  How am I going to talk to my kid?  First of all, you'd name me Ryu.  You were obviously high when I was born.  Oh, God.  Second of all, you go on radio shows across the nation and talk about how you cheat on  my mother.  Yeah.  Constantly.  And how you smoke weed.  Fuck that bitch, man.  You're like, yeah.  And then your wife would come in and be like, he's right.  You'd be like, shut the fuck up, bitch.  Yeah, this scenario you just played out is not-  You're a terrible- you're not- you're a terrible influence.  Are you shocked or this is normal? 
[04:06:00]  I don't know.  I- well-  I think- I think it's-  It's not normal.  It's not-  It's not- definitely not normal.  I'll say it's not normal, but I don't think it's freakish either.  I think your kids-  12.  Your 12-year-old-  12.  Is one of the cool advanced kids.  Not 16.  Not 16.  12.  Like who could- for me and you-  He's a genius, too.  He's like-  He's smart.  Super straight A student.  So he's got the half Asian in him that he's all doing.  He's all good with his numbers.  He's an Einstein dick suck.  I don't know.  What's going on here?  And then he's got the black kid in him that's like, yo, what up, girl?  Come on, man.  Okay. 
[04:06:30]  He's got the perfect mix.  He's got them both.  And he's biracial.  And girls love a biracial dude.  I'm sure that's-  Even if they're 12.  Gorgeous.  Yeah.  I just Instagrammed him when he was young, but I just can't believe like 12-  Yo, is it me or is it people out there with young kids that's getting their dick sucked out there?  Me and you who are parents out there?  Come on.  Me and you who, kid?  It's weird for us because when we were in high school, girls wouldn't speak to us.  Exactly.  Let alone put their mouths on our penis.  You were losers.  We were losers.  We didn't have Twitter.  We didn't have Facebook.  Nothing.  They have cell phones, they have iPhones, they have like, you know, gear. 
[04:07:00]  You're not prepared to have like a kid-  Like a Jordans.  Whose dad's a cool DJ.  Yeah.  Who's got money.  Who's biracial.  Who's got everything going on.  So he's like, what up?  My fucking dad knows Eminem, bitch.  And I'm getting my dick sucked every day, sir.  Yeah.  I get my dick sucked every weekend, kid.  I hope they don't say that or speak like that.  Like, if my dad was Eminem's DJ, okay?  Yeah.  I would be having, my dick would be sucked all the time.  Yeah.  At 12.  At 12.  Do it. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah.  I'd be like, I have to take a piss, but there's a girl's head on my penis right now.  I don't know what to do.  Because it's always there.  I'm really hoping I'm not the only one with this problem.  If there's people out there that have little kids that are getting their dick sucked, they  need to call right now.  So I don't feel like I'm the only one with a 12-year-old that's going to get his dick  sucked by another 12-year-old girl.  Who could need some support?  Who gets actually just jealous that it's happening for his son at 12 years old?  Like, this is an easier life.  Stanley T, actually, he had a talk with his son, and his son's already, he's already at  it.  Same, same shit.  Really?  How old is his son? 
[04:08:00]  But Stan was like, yo, you go get yours.  What?  Yeah.  Stan's the black guy on the morning matchup.  How old is his son?  I believe he's 12.  Getting that dick sucked.  Getting that dick sucked.  I was still playing with wrestling toys at 12.  Yeah, well, you still are.  I'm still playing with wrestling toys at 29, Nicole.  I was licking Barbie's, like, empty snatch.  There wasn't even a pussy there.  Yeah, there isn't anything there.  I used to pull the pants down and lick Barbie.  I was terrified of girls.  I was licking Barbie's ass.  You were.  At 12, you were licking Barbie's asshole.  Yo, I wasn't even thinking about it.  Yo, Playboy magazine was the only thing.  Hugh Hefner's shit was the only thing in the fucking, in the yard out there in the school. 
[04:08:30]  In the school yard.  That's it.  We used to look at the porno mag.  Teacher came, everybody ran.  And the porno mag would be sitting there.  Yeah.  Now they're fucking getting dick sucked.  I cannot believe there's children out there getting their dick sucked, man.  We used to, like, we'd have a whole group of us losers.  And all we would do, and this was, like, in 6th and 7th grade, we'd actually be bragging  about jerking off.  Oh, really?  Like, that's what guys do.  I never did that before.  Yeah.  You're a weirdo, yo.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Maybe it's a white thing. 
[04:09:00]  I don't know, man.  Maybe it's just a loser thing.  You were bragging?  I lied about it.  Yeah, I jerked off last night.  It wasn't true.  You never did.  Were you afraid to jerk off?  Like, the first time you ever did it?  I didn't know how to do it.  So what?  How did you learn?  Well, you just figure out you go up and down.  So I'd have a boner, and I'm going up and down.  You never had a wet dream?  Come on.  But I don't know how long it's supposed to last.  I don't know how long I'm supposed to do this for.  Never heard of the Met.  So did you know lube the first time, huh?  I don't use lube now.  You don't?  No.  That sounds chafely.  I don't use that either.  You don't use lube?  It's a whack. 
[04:09:30]  I'm a child of God, Nicole.  God gave me all the tools I need.  Now.  I only used lube on an old lady one time.  That's it, because she was 50, and she was on menopause.  Sure, so you got to.  You banged a 50-year-old?  She was hot.  Nicole, we're talking about 700 women.  She got money, too.  They're not all going to be 20-something.  Okay.  She's the nigga lover.  The first time, I would assume.  She was Jewish, too.  Was she?  Just like me, baby.  The first time I came.  Jew unit.  Jew unit.  That's the groupies.  That you're on the little sex. 
[04:10:00]  I'm part of it.  I'm Jew unit.  You better get Sal out of here, because of that Hitler mustache.  I don't know if you want to see Sal right now.  The first time I came, I jerked off, and actually something happened.  Were you like, woo!  I was like, what the fuck is happening?  Were you?  I was terrified.  What is that stuff coming out?  What is that stuff coming out of here, sir?  I didn't know what it was.  These feelings.  Everything got very sensitive and tingly, and I'm going, this is fucked up.  You didn't like it.  This is crazy.  You didn't like it.  But then I did it again.  And then you loved it.  And I was like, wait, those are like little babies I'm flushing down the toilet. 
[04:10:30]  This is fucked.  Oh, so you're doing it in the toilet from an early age.  Of course.  You jerk off in the toilet, Nicole.  I've never heard of anybody else do that, but you and Troy.  Troy and me jerk off in separate toilets.  Okay, my bad.  We got to go.  The phones did blow up, by the way.  I just didn't have time to go to them.  Everybody's kids are fucking.  Nicole, thank you for stopping by.  You got to come back some other time, because I wanted to talk to you about Trinidad James.  Oh, my Lord.  That guy's nuts.  I think he's on my show to Saturday, too.  He is?  Yeah.  So if you want to talk to him.  Troy got me on this. 
[04:11:00]  Trinidad James kick.  Pop the molly.  I'm saying.  Woo.  Woo.  It's our new shit.  You look like him.  I look like Trinidad James, right?  You got to get gold caps.  That's the sound he makes?  Nicole, you're welcome to join me and Who Kid next time when we talk about Trinidad James.  Have a great weekend.  Yo, and can I shout out if your son is fucking.  If your kid is getting his dick sucked, you hit me on my Twitter.  It's at DJ Who Kid.  Let me know so I don't feel alone.  Let me know that my son is getting his dick sucked.  That's all I need to know.  Tweet at DJ Who Kid.  If you go to at Not Sam, there's a picture of Nicole's feet. 
[04:11:30]  And there's a picture of Who Kid with about $1,900 that he has in the pocket.  No bank account, son.  What about my Twitter handle?  And at Mashup Nicole.  Thank you.  She's verified.  See you on Monday.  Goodbye.  Yo, nigga, what up?  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
