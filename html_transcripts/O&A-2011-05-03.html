<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing their impending channel change and the expected listener drop-off.  Anthony then recounted a profane and violent near-fistfight involving aggressive cab drivers and a bystander who criticized his driving.  The show then transitioned to an in-studio interview with Mike Baker, a former CIA operative, who detailed the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. Baker described the years-long intelligence gathering process, the raid's meticulous planning and execution (including drone usage), the challenges in Pakistan, and the disposal of bin Laden's body.  He also discussed speculation about Pakistani government involvement and the decision to kill rather than capture bin Laden, touching on SEAL Team 6's training.

Following Baker's interview, Morgan Spurlock joined the show. The hosts briefly discussed his documentary filming in Pakistan, highlighting its proximity to bin Laden's compound.  Spurlock then detailed his new movie, "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," which was entirely funded by product placement. He described the often absurd negotiations with sponsors, ranging from Hyatt Hotels to Maidenform, and the challenges of explaining the film's self-referential concept. The conversation touched on the history of product placement in film.

The discussion returned to the killing of Osama bin Laden, with Baker offering commentary on the geopolitical ramifications, the ongoing threat from Al-Qaeda, and the challenges of US military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. He expressed skepticism about long-term US military effectiveness and discussed the potential for retaliatory attacks. Spurlock shared a harrowing account of a Taliban ambush during his Afghanistan filming, contrasting his appearance with that of his cameraman.  The hosts and guests then discussed conspiracy theories surrounding bin Laden's death, particularly Alex Jones' claims that bin Laden was already dead, and why the US government might release photographic or video evidence. Spurlock also mentioned his upcoming Comic-Con documentary.  The segment concluded with further host banter, including a humorous anecdote about a former Navy SEAL guest named Chip.  Offensive language was used throughout.

The next segment focused heavily on the reaction to bin Laden's death and the surrounding conspiracy theories, particularly Alex Jones's claims of government manipulation and a staged death.  The hosts analyzed and debunked Jones's claims, highlighting perceived flaws in his logic and lack of verifiable evidence, contrasting his approach with their own emphasis on verifiable audio and evidence.  They discussed reactions from figures like Colin Powell, who learned of the event from his wife via news reports.  A caller, Roger, offered an alternative perspective, suggesting an opportunistic announcement precipitated by impending Pakistani revelation.  Troy Kwan joined the studio, expressing a desire for evidence of bin Laden's death while acknowledging Jones's entertainment value.  The conversation covered the difficulty of maintaining secrecy in large organizations and historical precedents of failed cover-ups.  The segment ended with further speculation, discussion of the news cycle, and a mention of Guy Fieri's upcoming appearance.

The final segment started with a discussion of a Bruins/Flyers hockey game and a player's head injury.  This transitioned into a "most annoying 30 seconds" contest using listener-submitted audio clips. The winning clip was static.  The show then moved to a discussion of *The Wire*, including anecdotes about meeting actors, and a bizarre anecdote involving a picture of Omar's penis.  A listener's audio clip of a poorly sung song, "Sunny D and Rum," was played, leading to a discussion of its surprisingly high YouTube views.  Guy Fieri then joined the studio.  The interview covered his TV shows, his new cookbook, and his culinary philosophy, with a significant portion focusing on the hosts' and Fieri's eating habits, particularly Sam's extremely limited palate.  Fieri shared a story about his Lamborghini being stolen by a ninja. The segment concluded with Fieri promoting his book and upcoming signings.  Offensive language was prevalent throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. 
[00:01:00]  Real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, good morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  We've got a very busy day.  Mike Baker should be here in just a few minutes.  Is this our last day on this channel?  I guess.  Today's Tuesday.  Wednesday's the big switch.  The fourth, right?  Which is tomorrow?  They were going to do it today.  And I called Mel.  I'm like, look, this Wednesday's better. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Better for everybody.  He agreed.  There'll be confusion for a while.  And hopefully people will find us on whatever channel we're going to be on.  What's good is...  I don't even know how to do that because I don't even know how people listen to us anymore.  Let's just not do a good show, though, for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  Oh, good point.  People will be jockeying around.  You know, you kid, but our numbers will be drastically down for the next week or so.  Until people figure it all out where we are, you know.  That takes a while.  What are we going to be on?  Like 185 and 209 or something like that? 
[00:02:00]  Oh, yeah?  I think so.  That's about right.  146?  It's about right.  I think 146 and 213?  No.  Wait a minute.  Oh, 115, 101...  Oh, no.  105.  Well...  Oh, 104?  Oh.  I think.  And 212?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Well...  I think it's 104, 212.  I can't even be sure for myself.  All right.  Anthony almost got in a fistfight on the way to work today.  Oh, it's just another...  Someone trying to talk about South Park?  And as he's telling the story, I'm thinking to myself, what could have possibly happened  that you have so much anger already?  I know.  Like, I'm an angry person and I'm uptight.  I'll be the first to admit.  You don't have to say it to me.  But it usually develops during the day.  Like, I'm at peace when I first wake up.  Nah, there...  You're ready to fucking punch someone in the face.  There are only a couple of things in life that get me really fucking riled up, especially 
[00:03:00]  this early in the morning, and one of which is any variation of my morning commute because  of douchebags on the road.  That is a huge issue with me.  But at this time, there's not many douchebags on the road.  Not many people on the road, which is nice.  And that gives me a nice, fast commute, very relaxing.  I got no problems.  But then when some motherfucker wants to start motherfucking with me, I can't deal. 
[00:03:30]  So I turn up 49th Street, right?  And...  From where?  That's from...  3rd, 2nd.  Yeah, from 3rd, right?  From 3rd.  And now I got to go across town, 49th, going westbound.  And it's like the last road I have to be on.  It's a straight stretch from 3rd, right across 6th, and it's, you know, a couple of miles.  And I make the turn, and there's just a fucking parade because ass-fuck cab drivers have to 
[00:04:00]  sit there after the light turns green, not know it turns green while the dome light is  on doing their stupid paperwork, and trucks have to fucking not pay attention.  It's just, like, no one gives a shit that people have to be places.  I think they just don't want to be anywhere, so they take their sweet-ass time and fuck  everyone behind them. 
[00:04:30]  Because at that time of the morning, how many people have to actually be anywhere?  Well, yeah, people have got to be at work, you know?  It's like people are going to work.  But it's like, regardless of that, there was a situation where this cross, 49th, has two  lanes.  And especially at that morning, where there's no one double parked and shit like that, it's  a two-lane fucking road, right?  So this cab asshole is parked there.  I pull up next to him on the right, and the light turns green, and this motherfucker now, 
[00:05:00]  now he's fucking top-fueled dragster.  He gasses the fucking thing.  Because for some reason, no reason whatsoever, but in his savage-ass fuck mind, he's got  to be in front of me and motherfuck me till the next light.  Like, all I want to do is jam on the gas and get through the next light that I can see up  at the next block, which is green.  And if this asshole's in front of me, I'm not making the light.  So I'm getting around him.  He takes off. 
[00:05:30]  I take off.  Now, the guy realizes I'm fucking, and I know, I'm going to be going a lot fucking  faster than you, a lot quicker than you are.  So I'm going to get around him, and I'll make the light.  Sure.  This motherfucker sees I'm starting to gain on him and pass him, and as I said, two  lanes, plenty of room for two vehicles, side by side.  He fucking starts coming over on me.  He comes over on me to the point where I now, I gas it now, really gas it, and I have to 
[00:06:00]  go up over the curb.  Now, two of my wheels are on the sidewalk.  Two are in the road because his cab is over on me, and now he starts beeping because he's  mad because now he knows I got him because now all I have to do is get around, and I'm  going pretty fast, and then I drop down off the curb, and I'm in front of the motherfucker,  which I did.  But because all these shenanigans, light yellow, red.  Now I miss the fucking light.  So now I make sure I pull way over to the right so this guy's got plenty of room to 
[00:06:30]  pull up right the fuck next to me.  My window's already down.  Already down.  Already down and ready to go.  What are you doing?  You almost killed me, he says.  I go, really?  You came over on me, motherfucker.  You savage fucking cunt.  Fuck your mother.  Fuck your mother.  And I am on him.  On him.  Because I'm not fucking telling you, he came over on me.  Plenty of room.  Like I said, plenty of room.  The guy doesn't want it.  He just didn't want me in front of him. 
[00:07:00]  And believe me, I was going way faster than he was ever going to go.  I was going to make the light.  He could stop at the light, turn on his dome light, fill out his paperwork, and hopefully  an unruly teen blasts him in the back of the head and takes his $20 out of his fucking  pocket.  Hate you, cabbies.  And a lot of them listen to us.  So then, fuck them all.  Hate them all.  So then, uh, so then, uh, I hear, I hear, you are wrong.  And it ain't the cab driver. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  So I look, I look behind the cab driver.  There's a guy in an air conditioning truck, uh, some black guy yelling at me that I was  wrong.  Right.  He goes, you are wrong.  You're not passed on the right side.  And then I said, I just go, shut the fuck up.  I go, it's not even your problem.  Not your issue.  And I'm yelling, yelling.  The second the light turns green, now everyone just beeps.  You're battling two different vehicles.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The light beeps.  I'm a, I'm a mere now block away from, from stopping. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Right.  So I pull, uh, up in front of the building and I see asshole cab passes by me, uh, without  incident.  I, I park and I see asshole air conditioning black guy pulls up in front of the building.  Now he stops.  And, and I'm like, well, there's a coincidence that this fucking guy.  So I get out of the truck and Kenny's there, you know, I go in the revolving door and, and  then I see that he's getting out of his van.  So I'm like, fuck this.  I go around the revolving door, back outside. 
[00:08:30]  And I, I said, I go, what, what's the problem?  You were wrong.  You're, he comes now out of the truck.  I'm walking into the building for it, but he's got to confront me.  He's got to fucking confront me.  You were wrong.  You were wrong.  You, you passed it.  I said, I wasn't right.  And I went through the whole thing real quick again.  And I'm like, no, he goes, that was right lane.  Uh, is, uh, and that's only made for right turns.  I go, no, no.  And I go, but believe me, I said, and at this hour, any lane is good.  So whatever. 
[00:09:00]  And he starts walking away.  He goes, he goes, well, you're, you're lucky.  It wasn't me.  Oh, really?  Really?  I'm lucky.  It wasn't you.  Why?  What the fuck were you going to do?  He walks to his van.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  He's like, well, what's he going to do?  So just stop it.  He stopped in front of the building just to, just to try to motherfuck me.  None of his fucking business had nothing to do with anything.  All fucking feeling all fucking. 
[00:09:30]  He's feeling all strong.  You're feeling strong.  He's feeling all strong because of Obama, I guess.  So he's got to, he's got to get out of his truck and confront me.  Fuck you.  Go install your fucking air conditioning.  I get like I did.  Fuck you.  I know.  You had a lot in common with that guy.  Unlucky cunt.  I finally figured out you got the six degrees of Obama.  Everything goes back to Obama with you.  Well, you know what?  How does that go back to Obama?  Because, because the guy I know.  Give me some logic.  He was, like I said, like Frank Vincent said, feeling strong? 
[00:10:00]  He was feeling strong.  You're feeling strong?  That's what it is.  The pride is back.  Because his man took care of the situation?  Oh, yeah.  I saw him.  Yeah, I saw him there.  Personally, in the compound.  I just had it.  The guy didn't have to get out of his truck.  He didn't have to confront me.  And then the threat, the little, the little threat at the end.  Well, you're lucky it wasn't me.  So, oh, why?  What would, what would you have fucking done, really?  If I fucking whipped around you on the right hand side because you were doing three fuck miles an hour. 
[00:10:30]  What would you have done?  Beat me up?  Would you have resulted to Burger King, McDonald's, KFC, Wendy's, fucking Chuck E. Cheese violence that I watch every day on the internet?  What is wrong with you?  Was that what you would have done?  It's too early for this.  Well, good fucking luck.  So, if Osama wasn't taken out, he would have been cool to you, you think?  He probably would have stayed in his truck.  Yeah.  Feeling strong? 
[00:11:00]  He was feeling strong.  Hmm.  You all right?  Breaking my party.  You all right?  Oh, I'm fine now.  Just fucking.  What if he pushed you in the chest real hard?  First of all, there were.  With the two index fingers.  There was an NYPD car parked in front of the building also.  I saw those guys.  So I think that might have kept them from any real shenanigans.  But if he would have pushed me in the chest, I'd have punched him right in the fucking mouth.  Kenny was there.  I didn't give a shit.  Kenny would have jumped.  Kenny wouldn't have let the guy push me in the chest, first of all.  And if I was alone and he pushed me in the chest and I punched him in the mouth and it escalated, then, you know, there would have been problems. 
[00:11:30]  Then things happen.  Then things happen.  What are you going to do?  I probably would have got my ass handed to me.  But whatever.  Whatever.  Hopefully somebody would have had it on fucking their camera.  It would have ended up on many websites that I frequent.  And it would have just been another in the collection of people being blindsided.  Do you know what a funny viral video that would be if Anthony got beat up in front of the building?  Oh, my God.  And there was some humiliating moment, like where he gets kicked in the ass and his shirt comes up and his fucking man tits scraped the fucking ground. 
[00:12:00]  Just like some weird moment that happens.  I was thinking the guy gives him a wedgie after he beats the shit out of him.  And drags him into the building by his underpants.  Just an awkward wedgie.  Just drops me off in front of the security guys in the building by my wedgie.  Yeah, your fucking big balls are hanging out the back.  We have Mike Baker right outside the studio.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Mike Baker, ex-CIA, has come by just to say hi to us. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, hit down line five real quick.  Yeah.  Could you do that?  Because I think I know where this guy is going.  Go ahead, Keith in Connecticut.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I love when guys like you come by because I jump right on your tail.  And this way, if the cops are going to pull anybody over, they'll get you first.  And it gives me time to slow down.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I thought he was going somewhere else.  All right.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, I thought it was like I like when people fly in front of me.  Because I've heard this, too.  Fly in front of him. 
[00:13:00]  And then they don't make the light anyway.  It's like, you know why I didn't make it?  Because of you.  I would have made it.  How are you doing, Mr. Baker?  Very good seeing you again.  Out of his mind.  I couldn't take it this morning.  I think the whole Obama thing is really getting to him.  Yeah.  I would have thought you just would have been in such a good mood after the whole bin Laden.  Well, I am in a good mood about that.  I had an altercation with some driving this morning on my way in.  And the fact that Obama is coming down to ground zero and going to be screwing up New York City again. 
[00:13:30]  Could you just give your speeches from the White House?  It's very nice.  It's very good with that.  It's important that it goes to ground zero.  That's Thursday, right?  I want to start by saying I saw you all over the TV yesterday, Mike Baker.  I'm sorry about that.  You're a big, big get right now.  Mike's the go-to guy.  I'm a huge guy.  Although I was bigger during the royal wedding.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a big one.  I was all over the place.  And you're usually a Fox guy, but I think I saw you on CNN yesterday, right?  Oh, you shouldn't have said that.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that going to mess you up a little bit?  No, no.  You know what? 
[00:14:00]  I'm good to go anywhere.  Yeah, I'm a complete media whore.  I'll go anywhere.  I'll go anywhere.  Why not?  Wow, so much to get into.  First of all, we all heard how this happened.  So far, the details are still coming in.  But as far as when this started, when the real intelligence came in that this guy is probably  in Pakistan, this compound is very suspicious, do you have any idea when that first started 
[00:14:30]  really ringing some bells?  Yeah.  Well, you know, the amazing thing about this is, you know, you get that 40 or so minutes  on the ground.  And rightly so, everybody's fixated on that because that's, you know, that's the hot time.  But to get to that point, you got an incredible amount of work that goes on ahead of time.  And what happened was they started picking up some information all the way back to 2007,  really, even a little bit before then, from detainees. 
[00:15:00]  And where were those guys?  They were, you know, being held by the agency.  And, of course, that program wasn't very popular for quite a while.  Didn't Khaled Mohammed mention the name?  Didn't they get it from him?  Well, they got it from, they were picking up stories from a variety of places about individuals.  Because what they were looking for was, you're looking for anybody who's somewhere in bin  Laden's orbit.  And you're trying to find some point of entry, right?  And so they didn't care who it was.  Somebody who was handling money, logistics, whatever it could be. 
[00:15:30]  And they started getting some stories involving the same pseudonym, the same alias.  And once you do that, you're getting, you know, over here, you get one, you know, detainee  talking about it.  And he mentions this, the alias.  You think, hmm, that's interesting.  Because over here, you know, last month, somebody mentioned the same person.  Kind of corroborates the stories.  Right, so then you start triangulating in.  And they started running these names in a very coordinated fashion.  Interrogations are incredibly labor-intensive.  So, unlike what, you know, all the crap was in the media about, oh, my God, interrogations. 
[00:16:00]  Waterboarding.  It's a very controlled atmosphere.  And so you take all this information, and they started running it past Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  and one other individual, Libby.  And these guys just blanked, right?  They said, we don't know.  You know, it doesn't ring any bells.  And, you know, in an interrogation, that sort of thing, if you've been picking up sort of  a consistency from independent interrogations, that'll ring a bell.  And rightly so, they thought, well, hold on a second.  If both these guys are blanking on this pseudonym or this alias, then maybe we got something here. 
[00:16:30]  They started working that.  More, you know, personnel out in the field.  More recruits in terms of Pakistani agents.  Everything they could find.  And they eventually got a family name for this guy, who was a courier.  Wow.  A courier does what?  Brings information or brings the tapes back and forth?  What exactly do they do?  Pretty much anything.  You know, I mean, he's running messages.  Like Kenny.  Not so much running cash, you know.  But, yeah.  Does he go grocery shopping?  In fact, one of the detainees actually coughed up Kenny's name. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, Kenny gave up clubs out of Kenny.  Yes.  He said, Lurch.  Code named Dummy.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said, I don't recognize the name.  And so, but that's the sort of work that it took.  And they got the family name.  Once you get the family name, then you take it.  It's, in a way, it's like an investigation you'd watch on CSI or anything else.  It is incredibly painstaking, labor-intensive, not particularly exciting,  but you've got to do all that work to get your 40 minutes on target. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  Right, right, to get the big, to go to the big game, as they say.  Exactly, exactly.  It's fascinating to learn that they were watching this in real time at the White House.  Now, that is, that's like Hollywood movie stuff right there.  Yeah, it's like a Tom Clancy thing.  Yeah, thinking that they're sitting there actually watching.  Now, I would guess some helmet cams.  Yeah, a lot of coverage, as you can imagine, because, you know, and it's not so much cover your ass, 
[00:18:00]  although, you know, unfortunately in today's, you know, world, there's got to be an element of that.  But a lot of it is also for verification purposes, you know, forensic purposes.  They want to make sure that they, you know, they've got a lockdown on everything there, including the people, the gear that they're picking up.  Yeah.  And they picked up some tremendous material off this.  Oh, man, from what I heard, now, you know, obviously we just here would filter through the news, but from what I heard, a lot of computer equipment, a lot of storage.  A lot of Bin Laden's porn stash.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, and you know, that would just be a kicker if you looked in there and just said, oh, so.  How great would that be?  He's into Lindsay Lohan.  Yeah.  But they got Osama's.  Particularly if it was, yeah, it was like, you know, like, goat porn or something.  But they basically got Osama's hard drive.  That's just amazing.  Right.  Absolutely.  And I think one of the best things about this is the fact that it was just outside of Islamabad, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, the Pakistanis are like, I don't know.  Yeah.  Now, this is really bringing up a lot of shit with the Pakistanis because it was next to what amounts to their version of West Point. 
[00:19:00]  So it was relatively close to it.  A huge complex that really didn't fit the neighborhood.  And the Pakistanis are just saying, hey, we didn't know.  Now, even saying we didn't know makes them look stupid because how do you not?  How do you not know?  Yeah.  How do you not know?  How does it not raise suspicion where you would go and maybe check it out or something?  Especially because this thing was being built in 2005, let's not forget.  Yeah, yeah.  This isn't an old mansion.  They keep saying a mansion. 
[00:19:30]  It's more of a compound that they started building in 2005 and no one is suspicious that this thing is going up.  And you know what this shit is like overseas?  In places like this, right?  Anything that's happening is more interesting than what's going on in your day, right?  So everybody in that neighborhood, which is a nice area.  It's kind of a picturesque part of Pakistan.  But all these people out there are saying things like, well, we had no idea.  We're so surprised.  And you get to say, well, you mean that tall guy down the street?  Well, I always had my suspicions.  What do you think the cover story was? 
[00:20:00]  What do you think they gave?  They had to tell people in the neighborhood something.  When they're walking by and they're seeing these big walls.  I wonder what they said.  No, no, it's just a minor on beeswax, probably.  No, they probably told them it was something else.  I wonder what they told people that was believable.  A lot of the military retired to that area.  So maybe that, you know, knocked down the suspicion slightly.  I don't know.  They might have told them it was for general or general or something.  I mean, from a cover standpoint, it was a smart move, right?  For a variety of reasons.  It's basically, you know, he's throwing himself right in plain sight, almost. 
[00:20:30]  And then he's also put himself in an urban area.  You know, obviously the last thing that he wanted to do was get hit by a drone.  So he knew that drones aren't going to be flying over that.  Right.  So there were smart reasons for them to put him there.  But it's inconceivable.  There is no way in hell that there weren't individuals in the Pakistani intel service and military who did not know that he was there.  And he was just there's just no possible fucking way.  It's just so odd that that for so many years and you realize how long he had probably been in this compound here. 
[00:21:00]  But for all those years that we just pictured him in that cave, kind of on a little blanket and just thought he was there for for almost 10 years, you know, after 9-11, that he's just huddled in that.  And meanwhile, you know, he's got his bed.  He's got his computer.  He's a short satellite dish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy was living large.  He's got his Spike TV and all that.  Yeah.  He's got a little Netflix. 
[00:21:30]  How long was he living there?  They're starting to say at least three years, right?  Yeah.  They think it was a good long time.  And so, you know, if you go at the end of the day, even even, you know, even a year is, you know, excessive when you think about where that location is, where it is, what's required.  So, you know, again, we'll we'll go through a dance right now.  And we already have started that dance.  You know, Secretary Clinton went out yesterday and talked about the terrific support and cooperation.  Oh, yeah.  The Pakistani government.  Yeah.  What the hell is that all about? 
[00:22:00]  That that came out of nowhere.  And it was like, why are you even saying that?  Right.  Like, not only is it utter bullshit, but you probably would get more mileage by not saying anything than saying, wow, they really helped.  Did they?  Well, did it come out, though?  We didn't even tell them.  Yeah.  Right.  I mean, there's there's there's we can't trust them at all.  So we trust them.  Right.  And there were there were there were scenarios or drama.  Anytime you have something like this, obviously, what happens and you present the information to to the president.  President will say, OK, well, you know, go away and come up with a plan. 
[00:22:30]  And so JSOC, the Joint Special Operations Command and the CIA, you know, together put together some scenarios.  One of the scenarios was actually to to do a joint op with the Pakistani military.  So you can imagine what that was like.  OK, scenario three.  Now, let's tuck that aside and put that in the shredder.  Is it possible that they that they passed the information to the U.S. and then just wanted nothing to do with it because of backlash, but from giving him up?  Like, is it possible that giving him up to us presented a lot of backlash from their people who really are a lot of Muslim? 
[00:23:00]  I mean, and they might have rather have looked stupid than look like they fucking betrayed him to the U.S.  No, I see where you're going with that.  I mean, it's you know, anything's possible.  Well, I don't think that's you know, I don't think that there's any chance that that happened.  Honestly, that if if that were going to happen, you know, he would have been long gone.  I mean, there was there's a concerted effort here.  And again, you don't want to make too much of it. 
[00:23:30]  It's not a government wide conspiracy.  You know, it's not like the entire Pakistani military and government were in on this.  There's enough rats in there.  Right.  There was enough.  And we've always known that we've always known there's sympathizers within the intelligence service over there and within the military.  So that's not a surprise.  But we've always been able to play this game, you know, that says, well, but we're still pretty much on the same sheet of music.  Well, in a way, you know, we are because their sheet of music says, you know, we don't want our power base to fall.  Right.  They've got their own special interests.  We got ours. 
[00:24:00]  Sometimes they match.  And sometimes, you know, more often than not, they don't really mix.  But we do this all the time overseas.  Yeah.  So how are we able to get the people that we needed, the helicopters and the resources in to Pakistan, pretty close to the capital, relatively speaking, and without them knowing without the Pakistani government, you know, picking it up and saying, hey, we're with all of these guys.  We used a CIA time portal. 
[00:24:30]  Ah, love those time portals.  We haven't talked about it before, but I guess we might as well disclose it now because I knew it.  It's a time portal.  They told me to say at least one thing that nobody knew about when I come on the show.  Exclusive time portal.  But it's, you know, the flight went in from just across the border in Afghanistan.  We've got operating bases all over, but this came out of Jalalabad and the surrounding area. 
[00:25:00]  And, you know, it's where that house, where that compound is located is maybe a half day's drive from there to the Afghan border.  That's a drive, right?  A drive.  Everything takes forever in a vehicle over there.  So, you know, you load up the choppers, you head out.  It's a harrowing journey, but it's a quick one, relatively speaking.  Right.  And, you know, they're coming in low.  But it's a good question because one of the biggest issues they had, because we're not doing a joint op, was they got to get in, right? 
[00:25:30]  They got to get out without some big fucking goat rope with the Pakistani military.  Right.  Yeah.  That would have sucked.  That would have sucked.  That would have sucked.  And so they got in.  They had a lot of air assets up there, besides the choppers, obviously.  Oh, sure.  And, you know, everything from the drones to, you know, surveillance to, you know, gunships.  But it was a hell of an operation, but it was a very well-planned operation. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, these guys, and the guys that were involved in this, the SEALs, you know, and also the CIA paramilitary, you know, personnel.  I mean, if you're not doing it, you're training, right?  And so every, there's no downtime.  You're always training.  And in something like this, once they decide on the scenario, and once the president approves it, and the clock is really ticking at that point, because you've gotten your surveillance in, right?  You've got eyes on target.  So you've already got assets out there, and you've got now a problem.  How much time do you spend training and preparing for it, and then how much is too much time, because you might lose the opportunity, or the information might get out. 
[00:26:30]  You know, somebody finds out about it.  Yeah, it's got to be a nerve-wracking time right there.  That's that point in time where it's really high speed, right?  Because you've got to make that calculation, and then, okay, now you've got to go.  And at a certain point, you're never going to have, just like, you know, they're going to be talking about this for a while now, but, you know, they didn't really have the visual that they wanted on bin Laden.  No, apparently no one really had confirmation that he was absolutely in that place.  Right, but you know what? 
[00:27:00]  They had enough information, and this is typical of really good, you know, operations.  At some point, somebody's got to have the balls to just get off the X, right?  So you've got to make that decision, and the agency and the SEALs came together and said, okay, we got it.  We got enough to take this risk, and, you know, off you go.  But, I mean, that's what it's all about.  But, yeah, I had a question about that shit.  I forgot what I was going to ask.  Oh, Jimmy.  It was something about bin Laden.  Something about bin Laden. 
[00:27:30]  Something about his house.  Oh, Predator drones, how high do they fly, and were they surveilling him 24 hours, you think?  How are they keeping a 24-hour watch on him without people on the ground?  Drones and satellite coverage.  Oh, satellite.  Yeah, the drones are, I mean, you're talking, you know, way up there in the flight ceiling, you know, 10,000, 12,000.  And, you know, higher, you know, I mean, these things are, when you look at these things, they are, they're varying sizes, too, depending on what you want.  You know, oftentimes you see the pictures of the armed drones, right? 
[00:28:00]  Right.  Pretty massive, you know, but, you know, the surveillance drones, you know, you're talking about, you know, real high-speed, small things.  But they'll stay up in the air also for, you know, multiple days at a time.  And you couldn't even see them at that altitude and with the size they are.  Oh, absolutely not.  Well, how small are they?  You never see these coming.  How small are they?  You know what?  I mean, you know, honestly, I mean, I'm not giving away any sources and methods.  Some of this stuff has been talked about.  But, I mean, you know, the size of a pizza pan, you know, some of these things.  No, that's absolutely true.  Oh, are they really?  Oh, yeah.  Amazing.  I took photos in front of them in Iraq. 
[00:28:30]  We got to sit in the actual control panel.  They wiped it clean, as they say.  Yeah.  But they were, like, they were big.  They were, like, you know, almost as long as the room.  But that's...  Those are the armed, yeah.  Right.  They'll fire the shit out of something.  I'm thinking they have to control, like, we used to control our motorized helicopters and stuff.  How do they keep them up without hitting a tree?  Guys standing out in the field and they're talking to each other.  And with the training, they do a mock compound somewhere?  Yeah, you'll set up in...  I mean, it's as close to exact as possible? 
[00:29:00]  Absolutely.  And so the people, you know, there's so many people involved in something.  I mean, well, okay, it's not like there's thousands of people involved.  But there are people that, you know, never get any recognition.  I mean, all the way down to the guys that are putting together these mock-ups.  Yeah, ballistic shooting houses, basically, you know, that are built off the blueprints of, you know, for instance, this compound.  So when those guys went in, they were very familiar with it after all the training they did.  Yeah, exactly, to as much as...  You always, you know, your preference is, you know, just train, train, train, train, train. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  But, you know, they had such good coverage on this place because we had so much surveillance going on and coverage of it leading up to this.  You know, once we finally determined we've got a target here that's really credible, that you've got almost everything except for the architectural blueprints.  Right.  So you know that it's 15 paces once you breach that door, you know, to that corridor.  And you know that corridor is going to go left and then it's going to go right.  You know how high that wall is that you've got to be concerned with.  And, you know, this is what these guys do.  Sure. 
[00:30:00]  So as far as surveillance goes, so you have surveillance on the compound.  I've always wondered this when you're watching somebody.  A van leaves the place.  How do you know Bin Laden is not in that van?  Well, I mean.  Because it seems like that's the easiest way to get someone out.  All of a sudden a van pulls up.  Next thing you know, the van pulls away.  And you're sitting there as the surveillance guy is going, what the fuck?  Is he in there?  Right.  Right.  I mean, if it's not, you're right.  If it's not a previous or something like that and you can't see through the windows.  But how does that play out with you guys?  Well, you know, the short answer is you don't know. 
[00:30:30]  And that's actually a good point because, you know, what you get used to and what I've found when I talk to people is, you know,  beach books, movies, you know, they expect everything to be cut and dried.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's either this or it's that.  Well, it's never that.  Right.  I mean, it's always fucking gray and murky.  And you're making decisions and you're moving forward based on really imperfect information.  And so you never get to that point where you have, you know, 100% confirmation or 100% quality intel. 
[00:31:00]  So it obviously freaks you out if you see a van come and go.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is he even in there?  Are we going to commit to this now?  But that, you know, what that does is that sends all sorts of other things in play.  Because, you know, then you've got to have the resources in place to say, OK, well, somebody picked that up.  You know, you take the van.  Yeah.  And now look at the van.  Right.  Follow it.  Figure out what the hell it is.  See who gets out of it.  And everything leads to something else.  So now you've got to worry about, well, fuck, we've never seen this vehicle before.  Now we've got to run that to ground.  Right.  And you're talking about it's not like you're in New York City or someplace else.  It's not that the police work is easy.  But, you know, it's not like you go to the DMV and shower and say, well, I'd like to look up the plate number. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  But so everything leads to something else.  It's just like this never ending, you know.  What's that saying where every military plan falls apart with the first point of contact?  It's just like, however much you plan, usually the first point of contact with the enemy, you're going to have to start thinking on your feet and change it.  Absolutely.  Now the copter is a prime example.  That helicopter not being able to leave that compound, obviously they had a contingency plan for that. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  They had enough resources to still get everybody out, which is great, and got rid of the old helicopter there.  It's like, we can't have it, you can't have it.  No, I get to blow it up.  Did Obama make some ballsy calls here?  Because they were saying that there was a few calls that weren't just like, all right, he's the president, he let it go.  There was actually timing issues and stuff where he said, yeah, let's go for this or let's do this.  Did he actually have something to actually do with this?  Oh, no, absolutely.  This would not have happened unless the president said, yeah, it's a go. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, if he hadn't authorized it.  So you've got to be fair.  No matter what side of the fence you're on in something like this, you've got to have respect for the fact that it was given a green light and moved forward.  Because, you know, he could have kind of said, oh, geez, I don't know.  What if it doesn't work?  If it doesn't work, I'm not looking for someone to be the Jimmy Carter guy.  Didn't he say no to a bombing for that reason?  I think they said that Obama said no to a bombing because they might not be able to identify the body.  And you're in a residential area, and if he's not there, and you kill civilians and he's not there, it's a big hole. 
[00:33:00]  Well, and it turned out there was, you know, 20-some-odd people in there, children and women.  So if they did.  Oh, were there?  Yeah.  A lot of kids in there.  A lot of kids in there.  Like toddlers.  23, I think.  If they did fire a missile into there and just blew up a bunch of kids.  Right.  Might not look too good.  I didn't know there was, I thought there was only four.  How did they, when they were landing, I guess the whole compound must have been alerted that they were there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I guess by that point there's nothing they could do, right?  Well, no, I mean, exactly.  Because no matter how you'd like to think they're silent choppers, you know, they make a fairly good racket. 
[00:33:30]  And so once they come in, they took some fire coming in.  I mean, so it's, you know, and all those kids that were in there, it's absolutely true.  If we had chosen that scenario, and that was one of those scenarios, if we had chosen that bombing scenario, you know, there would have been much less certainty over what had happened.  And yes, we would have gotten him, but, you know, we would have magnified this potential for blowback.  Are you surprised there weren't more people protecting him? 
[00:34:00]  There was only, what, four guys?  Yeah, given where he was, though, you know, your trade-off for kind of hiding in plain sight is your reduced profile, right?  So the more security personnel you got in there, the more logistics you got to worry about, you know, the more efforts has got to be made to keep everything tamped down.  If you have 12 armed guys walking the perimeter, people are going to start going, hey, who lives there?  Yeah, and you know what, and they've been...  But what about 12 guys out of sight, I'm thinking, because the place is big enough. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, but at some point they've got to go out and, you know, get laid and whatever, barbecue, you know, you like thinking it's like the movies where, you know, his cronies are just always around him inside.  But they've got lives, too.  These are guys, they've got to go out, they've got to do shit, you know?  Sitting out in the courtyard playing poker.  Yeah, something.  I see what you mean, but I think it's because they were staring at this place through satellite coverage and other surveillance means for months, trying to, you know, get a sense of what's the pattern of activity in here. 
[00:35:00]  Because aside from just knowing the physical, you know, facilities and knowing, you know, heights of walls and everything, you've got to know, you know, what is that pattern of activity?  Because, again, what are you trying to do?  You're trying to catalog people, you're trying to catalog activities, time of day when, you know, there's maybe, you know, downtime, what happens at midnight, you know, if you're going to launch.  What time did they win?  It was about just a little after midnight.  And I have to say, what a smart, bin Laden was smarter than I think a lot of people thought.  Like, they burn their own garbage, like little things that you might, I think, to do where there's just nothing came out of there. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, nothing came out of there, yeah.  They had no phone line, no landline going in, they had no computers.  You know, burning the garbage, you know, I mean, honestly, it's interesting because the neighbors, you know, of course, now you're getting the neighbor thing that you get here in the U.S., right?  You've got a psycho killer next to you.  They all say the same thing.  And here you're getting the same thing.  You've got a guy that's saying, well, you know, we were so surprised.  I actually read a quote from one of the locals.  He said, we were so surprised to find out.  He says, you know, my friend had met those people once at a bakery. 
[00:36:00]  And, you know, he told me about, you know, the tall, bearded man.  But he said he seemed very affable.  Oh, jeez, man.  I was so surprised.  They seemed so nice and quiet.  Hey, can you talk about the Navy SEALs a little bit, the special unit?  Yeah.  Well, this was SEAL Team 6.  They sound like motherfuckers.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  I got to tell you, they all are.  I mean, they're all, talk about fantastic, talk about well-trained.  I mean, all the special forces, right?  And, you know, it's just, you know, the SEALs and 6 has been working in Afghanistan, you know, since 2001. 
[00:36:30]  And so, you know, they are very familiar with the turf and the terrain.  They are incredibly adaptable, right?  So you throw a problem at them.  And they're almost, I don't want to say they're cerebral, you know, but they basically are.  I mean, they're thinking soldiers, and not that, you know, the others are.  That's not to disparage any of them, but they are a tremendous group. 
[00:37:00]  And the training that they go through and continuously go through, the single-mindedness that they have.  And so this operation, you know, was just incredibly well put together.  But it was also, I mean, you know, a big, you know, kudos out to the agency.  I mean, the CIA was pretty much leading the charge in terms of the intel.  And also, you know, military planning right alongside, because our paramilitary operations within the agency are just second to none. 
[00:37:30]  No, it's speculative, obviously, you know, because we don't know for sure at this point.  They said they encountered bin Laden, and he would not give up.  He resisted, and he took a double tap to the head.  Just speculation on your part, knowing some of the people and the mindset of some of this.  What kind of chance do you think they really gave him to give up? 
[00:38:00]  Before they pop him twice in the noggin.  Okay, wait, we're going to get this straight.  Yeah, because you remember bin Laden, like, he's walking, he's scratching his ass, he's eating that Hot Pocket, you know.  He walks out to hear what the noise is all about.  And, you know, someone says, do you want to give up?  Yeah.  No, you know what, they took that seriously, honestly, because they knew this was going to be the end result.  I mean, they walked this through.  I mean, and, you know, these guys, they're not operating in a bubble, so they're not going to say, okay, here's our, you know,  they have these discussions, you know, where they are brought in to understand the implications of things that may happen during the course of this operation, you know. 
[00:38:30]  And so they took that command, you know, to attempt to detain him seriously.  But, you know, you've got a lot going on around you, right?  It's probably, yeah, yeah.  And it is very chaotic moments, and so you're going to give him an opportunity, but you're not going to stretch that out into an open invitation.  An initiation or, yeah, yeah, a fucking blockade kind of a, hey, he's in here, let's talk him out. 
[00:39:00]  Your mother's here.  She's out here on the street, Osama.  Come on out, Osama.  Wait, do you really think that they want, what they did was genius because he's vanished.  He's off the face of the earth.  There's nowhere for people to go.  There's nowhere to build a shrine, and he's not alive, so they can't take hostages.  Because people would be taking hostages all over the world to try to secure his release if they had kept him alive.  You couldn't take him alive.  You had to kill him.  It's impossible. 
[00:39:30]  And having a place, a pilgrimage to go and have a place where he's buried to, you know, inspire people.  It is a very strategic thing, I think, that they just dumped him in the ocean.  That's great.  Well, you know, nobody was going to take that body anyway.  I mean, you know, reports are that they asked the Saudis, and I believe they did.  I mean, he was a Saudi.  You know, you can imagine the Saudis.  We don't want that.  We don't need that shit.  And so nobody else was going to take him.  And they were absolutely right to do what they did.  They showed, frankly, you know, and I think, you know, for correct reasons, they showed some real sensitivity and said, okay, fine. 
[00:40:00]  We're going to, you know, we're going to stick with sort of Muslim burial practices.  Yeah, all right.  I get what they're doing with that.  You know, frankly, you know, what I, who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  But, again, you're thinking about the implications after the fact.  But is that sensitivity, or is that smart, like, using their own religion as an excuse to dump the body immediately?  Like, hey, you guys are the ones that want to bury them immediately.  Adios.  No, it's convenient.  I mean, it's good that, you know, Muslim burial practices aren't saying we've got to bury a body within, say, you know, seven or eight days. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  24 hours.  Come on.  We've got to help this guy out.  I don't think we care that he got a proper burial.  I think Jimmy's on to something.  I think it was convenient.  Great way to get rid of him, and there's no, he's in the wind.  Yeah.  Where do you go?  So, yeah.  So, there's a guy out there that knows he killed Bin Laden.  I'm fascinated by that part of the whole story.  Like, and the world will never know the guy.  Will we never know who he is?  Well, you know what, the world being what it is now, I mean, if you had said this, you know, if this had happened 30 or 40, you know, during our parents' generation, you know, World War II, yeah, no one's ever going to know. 
[00:41:00]  Might be on WikiLeaks at some point.  It could be on WikiLeaks, or, you know, maybe the guy, you know, finishes up and signs a book deal.  Who knows what's going to happen?  That's true, too.  I killed Bin Laden.  What a title.  Does that guy get to go on vacation?  Like, or does he have to go right back to training?  Like, I can't imagine you're the guy that just took out Bin Laden, and now you have to go back to your, I mean, quote, job.  Right.  Like, what a letdown.  He'd go out for beers, you know, and try to pick up a girl. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's his stairway to heaven.  Exactly.  What do you do after that?  Yeah, these guys will be given some downtime, you know, because they've been training yet.  It's been nonstop training, right, in preparation for the ops.  So they'll definitely get some downtime.  But the good thing about these guys is, just like with my old lot, is they know how to keep their mouths shut, right?  Sure.  You know, so until there's a reason to, or there's an opportunity, and the military says, yes, from our perspective, it's okay, then, you know, they're going to keep their yaps up.  Does a guy like that get special privileges? 
[00:42:00]  We've been talking about that all the time.  Let me expose why we talk about that.  We all have this daytime fantasy that we're the guys, so we want to be accurate in our fucking childlike fantasies about what life is like after you do that.  I mean, it's not.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just.  You get an extra heap of mashed potatoes.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Do you get a break on your taxes?  Just some dumb thing?  That's right.  A free house and a hybrid car.  Will the president ever put a medal on the guy?  I mean, like a public.  Oh, you know, yeah, there's more than a certificate coming their way. 
[00:42:30]  There's no doubt about that.  They're going to have a.  No, it's what.  They.  Will the whole team be treated equally?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Will they all.  Like the guy who actually shot him.  It could have really literally been any one of them that shot him.  I mean.  Absolutely.  You don't know what's going to happen.  You rock up.  I mean, you've got again, you've got your movements.  You've got your.  The guy knows.  They all know who shot him.  Oh, no, I know.  Oh, no, they know.  But I mean, in terms of once you once you rock up on site, you don't know.  I mean, it could it could happen to any of these guys.  It could be the one who gets to tap him.  You go into a room.  Did they have a little office pool before they went in? 
[00:43:00]  That's right.  Wait, wait.  Don't shoot him.  Remember, Bobby's downstairs and he won.  Bobby, can you get up here?  Everyone throws a hundred bucks in.  Whoever gets the kill shot gets the pot.  Where were the kids and the women that they didn't get killed?  I mean, there's a couple of people I didn't realize.  It's a big compound.  It was a big compound.  So they had a feeling that that's where they were and where they had a feeling.  Well, they had to clear the place.  And so they, you know, through the logical, they cleared, you know, from the ground up.  And again, you know, all this was based on the intelligence that they had in terms of the surveillance.  And so they created a scenario on how to move through this facility.  And you're talking 40 guys approximately that went into this complex. 
[00:43:30]  More than that, but, you know, there were not very many that actually landed.  But again, there's guys, you know, protecting the perimeter and locking that down.  But I would gather there's also people going through the compound clearing.  And if it isn't bin Laden or another guy with a gun and it's women and children, obviously, you know, you don't open up on that.  You secure it.  And they were given over to the Pakistani officials, the women and children.  But, yeah, you hold them down, make sure nothing happens to them while, you know, the fun and hijinks happen upstairs or something. 
[00:44:00]  What if you got the duty of watching the toddlers?  I know.  That's just like, ah.  Bin Laden's getting on.  There's a firefight upstairs now.  I'm watching some kid piss his pants.  I'm playing with a stuffed animal.  Come on, come on, don't cry.  It's okay.  It'll be fine.  Handing out chocolates like the old days.  Uncle Paul.  So you think that Bin Laden, whatever he's doing in the bedroom, knows what's happening.  He obviously knows they're coming for me.  He hears the helicopters shooting, people yelling in that silly language. 
[00:44:30]  And he's just got to sit there and kind of wait, knowing he's going to be killed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was up on an upper level, along with one of his wives and a couple others.  But, I mean, it was clear, I think probably in his mind, you know, once the choppers, you know, came up over, that there was a problem.  Yeah, there couldn't be a problem.  Yeah, yeah.  And so having a look at that American soldier, though, for that, you know, split second or whatever it took before he got popped, had to have just been a moment for him like, oh, shit. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, but you do have to wonder.  And like you said, you raise that question about, you know, how long was that invitation to surrender?  Right, right.  And did the guy have to look through his dictionary?  He's keeping a beat on him.  He's saying, okay, now let me form a sentence here if you want to surrender.  Are you coming with me?  Are you going?  Yeah, you know, but to look, because obviously that had to look very intimidating.  An American seal standing in front of him, armed to the hilt, helmet, night vision, whatever he has on his helmet, and then just having to look at him like, motherfucker, they got me. 
[00:45:30]  My neighbor was pissed.  Really?  Arnold Azawahari.  He's this guy that lives next to me.  Oh, God.  He's a creepy doctor that helps me out when I need the Cialis.  Yes, I have.  Egyptian fella.  He's number one on the list now.  We got Morgan, I guess, is coming in.  Morgan Spurlock.  You want to stick around, Mike? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I'd love to if you've got school.  Yeah, sure, sure.  Yeah, it's a timing issue today.  We got a lot going on.  Morgan did a movie about...  He did a movie about going up in London.  Yeah, so is he outside the studio, or...?  Yeah, let's bring in Morgan.  This was before, obviously, before this happened, he had been putting this movie together.  I'm going to make this movie now.  How you doing, man?  Good to see you again, brother.  Hi, buddy.  Mike Baker.  Mike Baker.  Obviously, we're going to talk about the new movie, but we saw the old movie where you  went after Osama bin Laden. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I was in Pakistan.  You did?  I was trying to remember.  Pakistan.  I was watching that movie going, what the hell is he in Pakistan for when we know he's in Afghanistan?  I was trying to remember if you made it to Pakistan.  Yeah, I know.  That's where we ended up.  We ended in Pakistan.  That's where the film...  That's where we stopped.  We were in Peshawar, about to cross into the tribal areas, and at that point, my wife  was about a month away, a month and a half away from having our child, and I said, you  know what?  I think it's about time for me to go home.  Yeah.  The night before, we were about to cross over, or a couple nights before, two nights before, 
[00:47:00]  there was a madrasa that was blown up within the tribal area where, I guess, like 75, 80  people were killed.  And, you know, the report was it was a training, it was an Al-Qaeda training camp, and everybody  in the region was like, no, it's not true.  And all the journalists were there, like, saying, you should not go in there.  It would be a very bad idea for you, my American friend, to go wandering in.  What they also said was, you should go to Abbottabad.  That's right.  But I went home.  Yeah.  How far were you from where they actually caught him?  Probably about, when we were in Islamabad, so the shower was further west, when we were 
[00:47:30]  in Islamabad, we were probably about, I'm guessing, 40 miles?  Yeah.  They said 30, 40 miles.  Oh, so close.  Yeah.  Womp, womp, womp.  You know how annoyed the people that work at the drugstore across the street were?  Like, that was fucking 25 million sitting across the street for three years.  We blew it.  Oh, my God.  And back then, did people think that, you know, he was in Pakistan?  Well, people thought he was, well, the reports were that he wasn't in that, in this compound 
[00:48:00]  where he was that whole time.  Like, they didn't get, like, confirmed intelligence, I think, that he was there until, like, middle  of last year, that he was still moving around.  When we were there, everybody was thinking he was still in, like, Waziristan, you know,  in the tribal area, like, hiding out, you know, in that region.  So, and that's where everybody was pointing us to head.  Wow.  But, yeah, the fact that he was, like, in some big, giant compound right outside the capital  is pretty phenomenal.  It really is.  So, I guess you were surprised, then, when you heard the news.  Yeah.  Wow.  I was like, wow.  He's like, wow, he's right outside of town. 
[00:48:30]  He's in the burbs.  Yeah.  He's a commuter.  Howard Johnson right across the street from there.  That's right.  That's why I just pictured him looking exactly like he does with the, you know, headgear and  the big beard, just pushing a lawnmower outside his house, waving to the neighbor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Edging the curb.  Yeah, right.  See this big fucking turban over the seven-foot wall bouncing.  Who lives there?  That's a tall gentleman.  Yeah, he certainly is.  So, what is your, what's your new project? 
[00:49:00]  You do great stuff, man.  Yeah, no, thanks.  It's a new movie that looks at the whole world of, like, advertising, marketing, and product  placement, and the whole film's actually paid for by advertising and product placement.  I saw the trailer for this, and it looks hysterical, and it looks, at first, impossible, but you  pulled it off.  Yeah.  And the product placement thing is hilarious because it's everywhere.  It's everywhere.  It gets to the point where you're just going around, getting sponsorships in these meetings, 
[00:49:30]  which came off, some of them looking ludicrous, sitting down with these people like they couldn't  believe what you were trying to do, but you pulled it off.  Yeah, no, we raised the full budget of the movie through sponsors, like, about $1.8 million,  which is nothing, because the story just broke yesterday that the 007 film, the new 007,  a third of that movie's going to be paid for by product placement.  Oh, really?  Wow.  So a third of, like, $50 million of that budget.  So it's like, that whole movie's going to be, like, a giant, like, commercial.  Just a commercial. 
[00:50:00]  Tuxedos and Aston Martin.  Watches.  Cool James Bond.  Do you remember the first time I saw a product placement was in Superman 2 that I can remember  or that I recognize when he gets thrown through a Marlboro truck?  That was, like, when they're fighting in the street.  That's the first time I can remember acknowledging a product that was in the movie.  They just tossed through the big Coca-Cola sign, too.  That's right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's right.  No, I mean, I remember as a kid when I went to see E.T., I'd never had a Reese's Pieces,  and I, as a kid, I loved the M&Ms.  The M&Ms were amazing.  I loved Reese's Cups, and now here was a Reese's Cup in an M&M. 
[00:50:30]  I was like, holy cow, it's the best of both worlds.  Shit, I'm in, yeah.  Did they say that in E.T.?  I don't remember.  No, they didn't say what it was.  They said Reese's Pieces, and I said, what is that?  And my mom said, my mom leaned over and she goes, it's like a Reese's Cup in an M&M.  And I was like, we're going to the store immediately.  That's fantastic.  They sold a few through that movie.  Yeah, they did all right.  What was the earliest product placement, do you know?  A Sheet's Birth of a Nation.  A very high-thread count of Sheets.  No, the amazing thing, like Thomas Edison, you know, or even before that, like Jules Verne 
[00:51:00]  sold the naming rights to shipping companies in Around the World in 80 Days, so in a book.  But in film, Thomas Edison used to put ads for his own products in the movies that he shot.  What a whore.  He's a genius, I know.  That's great.  Hey, the light bulb.  Check it out.  Check it out.  This is some good stuff right there.  Wow.  So you wound up getting the whole thing paid for through sponsorships.  Yeah.  And.  So that's the best part.  So like day one, the movie opened, the film was already in profit. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  See, that's.  Now, what.  And all they wanted in return was that their logo be.  Well, no, they wanted.  They wanted a lot more than that.  Like they wanted ownership in the film.  We were like, absolutely not.  It's like you're giving me money to be in the movie.  So, right.  It's not.  You're going to go sell like widgets.  Go sell your widgets.  Yeah.  So it had nothing to do with them.  Loaning you money and then you having to compensate through profit on the movie.  It's.  Yeah.  It's strictly product placement.  And it does.  It does work like a NASCAR sponsorship where, you know, the fender gets a little more. 
[00:52:00]  The hood is like the big money.  Yeah.  Like the people who pay the most.  I got.  You know, I have a.  I have a suit that I.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw that.  I saw that.  My NASCAR prom suit.  Yeah.  And so like anybody who's in like the on the lapels.  Those are like very.  It's very high.  High dollar value.  That's a big one.  Right across the stomach.  High dollar value.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  So it did work like that where the.  But the placement.  Placement.  Everything.  They had to cough up some more.  More money.  Yeah.  Wow.  And.  And the fact that the movie is about getting the money is sort of this weird paradox thing. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Like Jimmy Kimmel, when he saw the film, he goes, well, this is like the inception of documentaries.  And I was like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was like, I'm putting that on the poster.  Yeah.  Because there wouldn't be a documentary if you aren't making it about something.  Making money to make the documentary.  So it really is an odd concept.  Yeah.  Smart.  That's you.  That's the odd concept.  I have an odd concept.  That is you.  Do you notice other people kind of coming out with these Morgan Spurlock-esque documentaries?  Well, it's like there's. 
[00:53:00]  I always get sent emails of people who have like.  You know, the people who continually to make films like disprove like the McDonald's diet.  Like the disproved super-sized meat.  It's like, look, I ate it for six years and I'm still healthy.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's.  So I always get.  I always get those emails from people.  But yeah, there's a lot of people who are doing like stunt films now or putting themselves in movies.  It's crazy.  Super-sized meat was great.  Oh, thanks.  You fucked up your body.  Yeah.  For example.  Like to this day, like I like will gain weight like that.  Like I can put on five, ten pounds in a weekend.  You think that just genetically changed you? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Well, I think, I think that what people don't realize when you gain weight, you know, that  that when you lose it, when you lose it, those fat cells don't vanish.  It's like, oh, it's going to be fine now.  It's like those fat cells just don't like, you know, jump ship.  They're still in there.  They're just really skinny.  It's not my body's filled with all these little.  And they're just waiting.  They're just waiting.  I got these little skinny.  They're just waiting.  Skinny renees over themselves.  Come on, Morgan.  Feed us, Morgan.  Exactly.  That at any moment, if you're here on.  One more slice of pizza.  One more.  Is that what lipo does?  It actually takes them out?  Is that why people get lipo?  It sucks that fat cells out.  Oh, okay.  So then you can eat a piece of cake at least so you don't blow up immediately. 
[00:54:00]  That's right.  I can't.  Are you thinking about it?  Of course I am.  My idea, I do 30 minutes on the elliptical machine and I reward myself with a treat.  Fucking fat pig hamster.  Poor Jimmy.  Sick of my body.  When is the movie coming out?  It's out.  It's just open.  Oh, it is out.  Just open?  Yeah.  Just open.  So what was the total budget?  For the whole film, it was 1.8 million.  That's what I thought you said. 
[00:54:30]  Okay.  So it wasn't a lot.  You're probably going to do well with this.  You're not going to lose, obviously.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, hopefully.  Knock on wood.  But that's the thing.  There's brands that came on.  We sold the above the title sponsorship to the movie.  So the movie is actually called Palm Wonderful Presents, the greatest movie ever sold.  Yeah.  And so they bought the above the title sponsorship for a million bucks.  But we didn't get the full million up front.  We only got 600 grand.  So the other 400 is tied to like, you know, certain box office and screens worldwide and  downloads and DVD sales.  And yeah, and they were really, they were smart about their negotiating. 
[00:55:00]  How much does big product placement cost like in a major $100 million film?  Well, like in Transformers, they paid like 10 million bucks to have like all the, like  all the, what did it get?  General Motors, all the, all the Camaros and all the, all the new cars in there.  Yeah.  But what, what about a box of cereal in the kitchen?  Oh, you know what I mean?  It's like 50, 50 grand.  That's it?  50, 100 grand.  That seems like a pretty good deal.  That's how close it is.  Too bad they didn't do that with Bin Laden's murder.  How great would that have been?  Yeah.  This fucking, this shot's sponsored by Bud Light. 
[00:55:30]  I'm really confused by that.  I'm confused by this movie because what do you, you tell the sponsors that they're going  to be in this movie.  Yeah.  That kind of takes the piss out of being sponsored of the movie.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's kind of like that reverse cool thing, right?  That's right.  Then they kind of get some cred.  Yeah.  Because they're in with something that's, you know.  But how do you tell them what they're doing?  Yeah, right.  How do you tell them what the movie's about?  I basically tell them, say, it's a movie all about this that's basically paid for by  this.  That's going to be great.  It's just amazing.  But that's some of the funniest things.  What I saw in the trailer was in the conference rooms when you're talking to these people and 
[00:56:00]  trying to convince them that this is a great idea.  It's a great idea.  It's all about product placement.  You're going to pay to be in the movie.  Yeah.  And it wasn't easy.  We called, I called over 600 companies to sponsor the film.  Of which, you know, 97.5% of them said no.  Right.  Like, the success rate in this film was like two and a half percent.  I was very happy to see the pony shampoo.  Maiden tail.  Maiden tail.  Maiden tail.  Maiden tail got in there.  I just feel like you would be stuck in a loop, though.  And then they go, but what's the movie about?  Right.  And then you say it again. 
[00:56:30]  But what's the movie about?  It's a paradox.  And then I say, you're watching the movie right now.  This is it.  Right now.  We're shooting.  Morgan, you're brilliant.  We're shooting.  You're fucking brilliant.  Yeah.  At one point, and the shot is hysterical because somebody goes, what's the movie about?  And Morgan just turns around and goes, this is it.  You're in it.  You're in it already.  You're in it.  You don't even know it.  What was the biggest surprise yes you got?  The biggest surprise yes was Hyatt Hotels, like Hyatt, which is like a real conservative  company, conservative family. 
[00:57:00]  Like when they jumped on, I was like, wow, we might actually pull this off.  This is fantastic.  It's not like some mom and pop, like Bob's shipping, you know?  It's like a real company.  Hey, that's a good question.  When did you realize that this was going to be a movie that people would see?  Because you go into this going, this could be a disaster.  Yeah, well, you never know.  I think Sundance, when the movie premiered at Sundance and it played.  No, I mean when you were filming, though.  Oh, where you knew as a creative person that you had something.  There was a moment when we called Maine and Tail, when I was speaking to them on the phone.  Yeah, Maine and Tail.  And I was chasing them for months to try and get them to do the movie. 
[00:57:30]  And finally, about halfway, I set up a call with them.  I'm talking to the president of the company.  And so you hear me say to him on the phone, he goes, well, how's it going to work?  And I said, well, we'll probably see the product in the beginning.  You and I will have a conversation somewhere in the middle talking about the placement.  And then we'll see it again in the end.  And he goes, that sounds great.  And so I was having that phone conversation and we're filming it.  I'm like, oh, yeah, that all just actually happened right during that.  Yeah, I could cross that one off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Done.  Was there one, was there a sponsor that you really wanted to get that didn't come through? 
[00:58:00]  Well, I really wanted to, see, the whole goal was to make like a documentary blockbuster, like a docbuster.  And you can't have a blockbuster without a fast food partner.  And so I was like, well, we've got to have a fast food partner.  So, of course, we called McDonald's.  McDonald's didn't call back.  I called him four times, five times.  Like, literally, the sixth time I left a message, I'm like, hey, it's Morgan Spurlock.  It's going to be really different this time.  Please call me.  Here's my number.  Thanks.  Never called back. 
[00:58:30]  They hate you, don't they?  We've got a great relationship.  I call them.  They don't call back.  Works out fine.  Well, that's the strange thing.  Super Size Me did great.  And you didn't affect their numbers in the end.  Maybe in the short term, maybe.  They did better in the end.  I think they're worth it.  Do you think your movie actually helped their business?  They should send me a thank you note.  Yeah.  Or at least some sort of pick-me-up bouquet made out of bacon and fries.  Do you eat there at all, ever?  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.  No, the last time I ate there was March 2nd, 2003. 
[00:59:00]  Like, at the party scene at the end of the movie, you see me kind of having my final birthday farewell.  Yeah, that was it.  I like the occasional coming home on the road at 2 in the morning.  There's nothing open.  The rest areas all have McDonald's, and I'll grab a couple of hamburgers.  Once in a while, it's great, but I can't do it more than once in two months.  Yeah, but late at night, I find there's other great places to get burgers in the city.  There's great, like, dirty...  In New York, yeah.  The rest of the country doesn't have that.  Yeah.  In the city, it's like, why the hell would you bother? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, there's so many good burgers.  So many good burgers.  Yeah, but, like, if I'm in L.A., like, I love, like, the original Tommy Burger, like, at Beverly and Rampart that's out in East L.A.  It's like this little shack that's been making burgers for, like, 50, 60 years, and it's like a heart attack in a wrapper.  But, like, that's a great late-night burger.  How's Five Guys?  I haven't had one yet.  Five Guys is pretty good.  Yeah.  I haven't had...  Yeah, I had...  A Five Guys burger?  Oh, no, I didn't even know it was a place.  I just...  I thought it was an odd question.  It's like, is this his next documentary?  It's a Five Guys.  That sounds like a lot of work. 
[01:00:00]  It's like a new Belladonna movie.  That's worse than four, not as bad as six.  We go way back with you.  You remember, right?  Way back, I bet you will.  Way back...  Remember that?  Way back when you guys...  Oh, man, yeah.  We were at WNEW.  Remember you were on terrestrial radio.  But you came in as a nobody with this idea that did very well, and then you moved on to film.  We sold it to MTV.  Like, we were with you guys first when we were on the web.  Yeah, shit, I totally didn't even realize that was you.  Remember?  He would do, like, street stuff.  I'm trying to remember exactly. 
[01:00:30]  He'd make people you'd like to offer more money.  Yeah, when the show was talking, I bet you will, and we'd bet people to do stupid shit  on the street for money.  Just walk up to random people out of nowhere.  Yeah.  And we did some great, great bets.  We did one on the street, which we ended up redoing in your guys' studio, which was  we handcuffed three people together, and it was called a piss-off.  And so the people said they would start drinking, like, you know, 10 ounces of liquid every minute.  And the first person to pee themselves got $100.  The second person got nothing. 
[01:01:00]  And the third person got $500.  So there was a strategy.  Yeah, there was a strategy to it, right?  Do you just do it to take the...  So do you either just say, you know what, I'm just going to take the $100 and just go  quick.  Be the first guy.  Be the first.  Or do you try and hold out until the end?  We're not allowed to do those bits anymore.  No.  Those were the days.  We had...  Somebody died from a water drinking contest years ago.  Our favorite bit, St. Paddy's Day, we were giving money to the first guy that would  piss his pants in front of a huge crowd. 
[01:01:30]  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  He got up on stage and just...  The wet spot appeared.  The place went nuts.  How long did he hold out?  I wish we had video of that.  How long did the guys hold out?  Like, that person held out, like, an hour, I think.  Yeah, I think so.  It was a long time.  I don't think we did anything else that day.  It's a long time.  A little different than what you do, right, Mike?  We would hold the same contest.  You're in a safe house for weeks and weeks.  I'm sure there are a few times...  Come up with these things.  I'm sure there are a few times you watch people piss themselves, too. 
[01:02:00]  Varying reasons, that's right.  What do you think they're going to do about Al-Zawahiri?  I mean, he's the last one of those guys that's got to be caught.  Well, there's a lot of them, and that's the problem.  They've got almost a bottomless well of douchebags that they can recruit.  And also, you know, there are...  I hate to say this because it makes them sound a little bit more like Lex Luthor, but there's  succession plans, right?  And so, you know, Zawahiri is the logical one, and he's the one that a lot of people say,  oh, it's got to be Zawahiri.  But, you know, he's got problems, and, you know, first and foremost, he's an Egyptian. 
[01:02:30]  That doesn't sit well with the Saudis and Yemenis within the group.  And, you know, he's kind of a...  He fancies himself a big thinker, right?  Not necessarily an operational strategist, but there are others within.  They've got a military committee.  They've got a couple of guys in that.  They've got a couple of strategists.  Even, you know, some scumbag like Al-Laki, you know, could end up rising up to the top.  So, somebody will take this guy's place, and, you know, it's naive to think that just because  we tapped Bin Laden, somehow that's the demise of Al-Qaeda. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know what, the guys in the agency and the guys in, certainly in the teams and elsewhere,  they know better, right?  They're going to enjoy the moment, you know, and then it's back to work.  It's already back to work.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you think the threat level is, you know, just...  And I know, as far as what I hear, yeah, it's a word orange.  I think...  Remember, we got rid of that plan.  Yeah, yeah, it's all new now.  I don't think Bin Laden and a lot of people are saying it wasn't really a day-to-day guy 
[01:03:30]  with Al-Qaeda, but as far as being a figurehead, pretty huge.  And taking him out, it seems like they would want to do something to make up for that.  So what do you think our level of threat is at?  Do you think it's pretty high, or do you think we're making a little much of it?  No, no, no.  I'd say there's a heightened concern right now over potential retaliatory strikes, right?  Because, I mean, logic just tells you.  You know, there's not anything specific yet, you know, but they'll be watching, you know, 
[01:04:00]  obviously for any potential, you know, everybody likes to use the term chatter,  but basically they're looking for any movement.  And something like this, any time you have a scenario like this, it creates movement,  which is fantastic because, you know, it's like the rats putting their heads up.  Starts bringing people out, yeah.  Then you've got opportunities to, you know, take out others or to develop new leads.  And, you know, but there is a concern that, you know, in the short term, for sure,  Al-Qaeda, even the Taliban and some others are going to be looking at an opportunity  to show that they're still relevant.  Yeah, yeah, that just taking him out didn't destroy him. 
[01:04:30]  Who was the scariest person you came across there, Morgan, in your travels?  I mean, we came across some people, I mean, we were in the middle of a Taliban ambush  when we were in Afghanistan, which is, you know, never a good thing to be in the middle of.  No.  Would you have rather have been shot and killed or captured in a moment like that,  knowing what they do to capture an American?  Well, I think you might have, it depends on who captured you,  you may have had a chance to live if you were captured.  So you would hold on to that hope?  I would have gone with captured.  Holding on to that hope, though, that, oh, my God, please don't make me this saw the head off the guy. 
[01:05:00]  Don't make me the video.  I don't want to be the video guy.  Never let yourself get captured.  You know, whether you're talking about, you know, I tell my kid this all the time,  I said, you know, anybody who tries to grab you, you know, that is it.  You do anything it takes, you know, to not go in a car.  And it's true when you're talking about terrorism, right?  You know, and you don't want to be that guy, you know, that ends up, you know,  having to be, you know, off that way.  Yeah, that's what's hard.  You see the orange jumpsuit hanging up on your side. 
[01:05:30]  But, I mean, your best opportunity to get out of any situation like that is at that moment that it's happening.  Right, right, at the abduction moment.  How old is your kid?  I got a kid who's getting ready to go to college, and then I got little toddlers.  I would imagine your kids know some moves, though, Mike.  They're all heavily armed.  Go for the eyes.  It's all about going for the eyes.  And Morgan, it has to be said, is crazy for going over there and doing that documentary.  That is a little crazy there, Morgan.  That's insane, especially how you look, you know. 
[01:06:00]  You kind of look like an American.  You are the American.  I am so not the guy that fits in.  Yeah.  I'm trying to look like a middle relief pitcher.  It's like a big job with an albino walking around Afghanistan.  Don't sell yourself short.  You blend.  That's right.  It's been a few years.  How did you blend in again?  I can't remember.  Well, I mean, even after I grew out my beard, which, once I grew it out, became very thick  and red.  It looked like, again, I looked like a very pale Santa Claus in the middle of this, whereas  my cameraman grew his out, and he looked like an Afghan.  He looked like an Afghan. 
[01:06:30]  It's like, he looked fantastic.  It's like, me, I did not blend at all.  Right.  He'd have been like, I did not know this man.  I'm like six foot two, so I'm already like almost a foot taller than, like a head taller  than everybody that's on the street.  And this pale, lanky, you know.  Did you see anyone like you there?  Yeah, both of them.  That was it, right?  No, there was like one or two other guys who were very pale, but that's very rare.  And why are they there?  Very rare.  Making documentaries.  No, you'd see other journalists there who looked like me, but most of the guys, you know, 
[01:07:00]  didn't wander too far outside of, like, uh.  They just hold up their Canadian passport and laugh at you.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck you.  I'm Swiss.  You're going first.  That's right.  I got to cancel my gig.  I was supposed to host at lunch at this Kiwanis club in Karachi.  I'm like, this is not the right time.  I didn't tip them well there, but you should probably cancel.  Toastmasters.  Yeah.  That just seems like a pretty scary thing you did there.  And like before, what kind of situation was that with the Taliban?  Well, I mean, we were embedded with the troops, and we were on a patrol with them, and then 
[01:07:30]  right in the middle of it, they were getting shot at.  Right.  It wasn't far outside of Kabul.  We were probably about an hour out of Kabul.  And I would gather they responded in kind to me.  They did.  They responded very much in kind.  Tenfold in kind.  As, uh, that guy got dragged off, you know, not alive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was, I was watching some videos, uh, online, and, and they showed, uh, one guy, um, and  he was, he was firing, I guess, uh, RPG.  And, um, he fired one RPG, and you just see him get lit up. 
[01:08:00]  I mean, this guy had to just be an idiot.  One guy with an RPG, and then you see tracer rounds just filling the weeds where there's  nothing, nothing left of that guy.  Yeah.  I do like how the Americans do respond to, uh, some of those situations.  I've seen a lot of videos, too, where, um, it really does dispel, because it's available  now.  I mean, people have cameras.  They, they have their own cameras that they, they, they send, uh, uh, videos to their families 
[01:08:30]  and whatnot, and they get out.  And, and this whole thing of, you know, this soldier, this John Wayne type soldier just  gets blown out the window, and it's like, holy shit, that motherfucker came apart.  Yeah.  They're like, wow, the mindset that takes is, uh, amazing.  How long are we going to be in Afghanistan?  I mean, it's like, things like, things like with this kill team that came out recently.  It's like, whenever you're somewhere long enough, there's going to be guys who fuck up  and do awful stuff.  Like, you know, there was Milai in Vietnam.  You're going to have it.  You can't avoid it.  And it's like, when do we just get out of there?  You got guys who are like doing, they're on like the third tour now. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More.  Yeah.  More.  Why don't we just get out?  What are we going to do?  The Taliban is fine.  If you did two tours in Vietnam, like, that was a huge deal.  Right.  Right.  Three.  There has to be something that happens in your mind where you're just like, I'm so  used to this.  This is nothing to me anymore.  Yeah.  Laughing at yourself when you vomited at your first friggin', you know, split open head.  And now it's just like, hey, check this guy out.  And part of it's also just dealing with the tedium, right?  That's right.  I mean, there's, because, you know, there tends to be, it's like, it's like operations. 
[01:09:30]  You know, there's, there's months of, you know, and then all of a sudden you got five  minutes of, of, of excitement, right?  Yeah.  And then you got months of crap and then if I, so with, with the, the Afghanistan question,  no, it's absolutely, that's exactly the question that should be, you know, being asked right  now is what the fuck's our exit strategy?  What's the game plan?  And why do we honestly think it's in our national security interest to still be there trying  to create some bullshit pseudo stable semi-democratic institution?  Right, right.  They want, don't they want Sharia law?  A lot of these places, like why are we trying to force it on people?  They don't want it.  They don't want it. 
[01:10:00]  They want Sharia law.  Let them have it.  It's their country.  Well, I mean, also the Taliban, I mean, you mentioned Vietnam.  I, we, we, we're not learning these lessons.  We go back 25 years to the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.  There are a lot of similarities.  I've gotten some arguments with some military strategists who say, oh, it's nothing like  when Russia was there.  Well, bullshit.  It's a lot like when Russia was there and you know, the Taliban has no place to go.  Right.  So they're going to sit there and they're going to wait and they know we're going to leave  at some point.  They know they'll leave.  Yeah.  They're very patient.  By the way, I like the fact that even on that level of, of, of guys who know their arguments 
[01:10:30]  are like ours, it's just like that.  Ah, bullshit.  No, it's not.  That's exactly the way me and him would argue it.  We don't know what we're talking about.  Yeah, that's, uh, we, we, we definitely should have some kind of exit, exit, uh, strategy.  But, and I think, I think the idea that we can keep just moving around and, and breaking  down these Taliban, uh, camps and, and training camps, it's a ridiculous notion. 
[01:11:00]  The place is giant.  Uh, they, they know it and will always know it and be able to, uh, travel in those mountains  better than we can even, you know, uh, and, uh, they have the people, you know, the support  of, of all the people.  So what the fuck are we still doing?  Well, we, we, we, we're, we're, we're tending to now kind of buy into this, this positive spin  that's being put on how things are going.  I mean, we, we saw it right after, you know, we, the news came out on bin Laden say, well,  this is, the momentum is shifting, you know, and, and, and by the way, and then you, you 
[01:11:30]  heard some of the senior officials tag on about, you know, the, the positive steps that  we're seeing in Afghanistan.  I don't know what they're watching, right?  Because, you know, yes, you know, wherever our guys are, they do a great job wherever  they are.  Right.  Right.  But the minute they leave, yeah, the minute they leave or, you know, this idea that somehow  we're going to leave behind the Russians got in there and after about four years, they  made the decision to get the fuck out.  It took them about five years to figure out how to do that.  Now, some of the things that they were worried about, some of the things that they were trying  to figure out, one was they couldn't hold the countryside.  So they retreated to the urban centers. 
[01:12:00]  And then another thing was, how do we leave behind a government that's, you know, friendly  to us and going to, you know, push forward our agenda?  Well, how do we do that?  Because they're, well, they're corrupt and they're, they're unstable and they're, they're  disjointed and dysfunctional.  We're doing the same things.  We're dealing with the same issues.  And it's very, very disappointing when you think back and, and I'm old enough to, to remember  when we were back there and we were trying to push the Russians out.  It's very disappointing.  If you had said to, to, to back then, oh, you guys are going to be here soon.  You're going to be doing this.  Yeah, I don't worry. 
[01:12:30]  You'll do the same thing.  That's right.  And what about, we're out of Iraq, right?  No, not really.  No, I thought, I thought most of our combat troops were out.  Well, we're, we're there in largely an advisory and training capacity, but that has an enormous  psychological impact right now.  Once we turn out the lights and walk out, you know, then it's a, I would argue that in  Iraq, it's also still a, you know, open book on what's going to happen.  Every documentary.  How many guys are there?  Shit.  But at this point, I don't, I don't even know. 
[01:13:00]  I don't know.  Every documentary I've watched on Iraq.  I don't know.  You know, there's 470, I think.  That's bullshit.  We're having a high level discussion here.  The, the, the, the Iraqi army is treated like garbage by the American military that is  supposed to be training them.  And, you know, they're the guys that are taking over and every documentary I've seen, they're  a joke.  They are literally a joke force that can't do, seem to do anything right. 
[01:13:30]  It was constantly American officers telling them, keep your fucking head down.  What are you doing?  Get your men over there.  Move.  Get up.  Move.  Like, they don't know what they're doing.  So the second we leave, whatever revolutionary force comes into power or whatever, you know,  whoever wants to take over, I don't think they're going to have much trouble stomping  over the military.  It's going to be like with the Afghan national, the, the, the police, the Afghan national police  and the, the Afghan national army, where they would be in fights and they would say, no, 
[01:14:00]  no, we'll come to your side.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, don't worry about it.  We just want to be on whoever's winning.  Well, and that's, and that's a really, really good point because, you know, everybody out  there is, is kind of making that calculation.  You know, what's going to happen when you guys leave?  How, how badly am I going to get fucked in this equation if I fall on the wrong side of  things?  That's right.  And, and then you've also got, you know, that we've had an increase in the number of, of  incidents where Afghan soldiers have turned on our guys or allied forces.  And, you know, that creates sort of this, obviously it's hard to trust when, you know, when the 
[01:14:30]  guys you're training, you know, there's been some problems like this.  So I, I, I'm just, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not hitting that bid on the whole  Afghan thing.  Yeah, I don't, I don't like the idea of what's going to happen after we leave.  I think it's just going to go right back to what it was.  Like you said, there are patient people.  Yeah.  Isn't it just ego at this point?  You don't want to look bad.  I mean, after we left Vietnam, peace with honor.  I know that.  Yeah.  I love that one.  Peace with honor.  Really?  Hightail your ass out of there.  Push the Hueys off the deck and let's get the fuck out of Dodge. 
[01:15:00]  Vietnam came together as a country.  They're fine.  They're doing fine.  They didn't, you know, it's like, well, they did.  Yeah.  But at that point it was such like, like you could look at things now in the light of  what we have today.  But you look back then, that was a communist domino.  Again, again, we would not want any country to fall to the commies.  And that's why we did so much, especially in Southeast Asia and whatnot.  But now, yeah, of course, there are tourists.  You go there to Vietnam. 
[01:15:30]  You're like, hey, here's one of the tunnels.  That's right.  Check it out.  It's a pisser.  I mean, people actually go there.  No, no.  Get in the pit.  I'll take it.  Yeah, Joe.  Take my picture.  Yeah.  She's doing a deer hunter scene.  You sit there.  Yeah.  She's doing a deer hunter scene.  That's what's going to happen to the Osama compound.  Yeah.  It'll just become an attraction.  Give it enough years.  Don't be surprised.  I thought we burned the whole thing down, but obviously we did not.  I thought so, too.  What was the fire?  Yeah.  There was a big fire that was showing.  We blew up the chopper.  There were some, you know.  Because now they've got soldiers on the roof of that place just kind of, you know. 
[01:16:00]  Securing.  Pakistanis are over there now.  They took over.  They took over.  They took over.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.  Take the empty fucking house.  Exactly.  I know we're at.  The governor in the Jalalabad over there, the governor of the province there, wanted to  turn Tora Bora into a theme park.  No surprise.  A flume ride.  Unruly.  Right through the mountains.  You take a wacky picture and all of a sudden your head winds up on your back.  I know we're wrapping up with Mike Baker.  I want to ask you about the conspiracy guys, because we got some audio of good old Alex 
[01:16:30]  Jones that we're going to play after the break.  We're going to go in another direction here.  He thinks bin Laden's been dead for a year.  Of course he does.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They froze him up, and now they decide to do this now and tell the world that he's dead.  Right with Ted Williams' head on his body.  Yeah.  He's a great ball player now.  What do you think when you hear stuff like that?  Well, you know what, there's always going to be a small segment of people strapping on  their tinfoil hats and coming up with these bullshit ideas, and you're never going to 
[01:17:00]  be able to push them off that mark, right?  No matter what you do.  And so you've just got to deal with it.  You say, okay, fine.  That exists.  And the more you respond to them, the more they dig in.  Do you think they should show the photo?  You think the photo should be a show?  Well, you know what, honestly.  They have to.  They're going to have to, exactly.  They're going to have to.  And it's not as if America hasn't seen worse on CSI.  Oh, my God.  You know, they're going to have to.  I hear the next thing is the video of dropping them in the sea. 
[01:17:30]  That's going to be released.  Yeah, that'll be oddly.  You know, that'll be probably an easier call than the headshots.  Is this to shut up some of these conspiracy guys?  Well, I think it's not so much to shut them up as just to, you know, convince.  I don't mean convince, but to show the world, not necessarily that batch of conspiracy theorists,  because they're smart enough to know that's not going to change their opinion, right?  Nothing will, right?  No, but it's kind of to bring sort of a final curtain around it.  Yeah, it is kind of, hey, look what happened to this guy. 
[01:18:00]  Because like we said earlier to start this, it wasn't good enough to just blow up the compound and say we got him.  It was really important to get some footage proving we got him, some DNA, maybe some video, some still pictures, right?  Right, right.  That seems exhausting when you just want to go in and get the job done.  Well, you know, it happens so quick, right?  I mean, because, you know, you take a couple of snaps, you know, you upload them.  You got analysts sitting on the other side of the world.  You know, they do the facial recognition.  You know, they've got, I mean, it only takes a very short while. 
[01:18:30]  It takes a few hours, you know, to run DNA nowadays, you know.  And we had DNA samples from, you know, from family members, from some of his, you know, half siblings and kids.  So, you know, you run that, you got dental records and fingerprints.  You know, you put all of that together.  And aside from just the fact that you know you got the motherfucker, right?  You know that.  But you got to go through these other steps to prove it in the world.  And when you release the picture of him dead, people will go, oh, that's not him.  Right.  It's obviously not him.  Photoshopped.  His eyebrows are different. 
[01:19:00]  It's like Saddam had all those, you know, people who would go impersonate him.  And that's just the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, ah, you can tell the bridge of his nose.  It's so weird.  Yeah.  It's so weird to see those death shots.  Remember when the Saddam thing came out?  Osama's brow looks different.  Yeah, there's a hole in it.  Yeah, yeah.  I see a very nervous publicist outside, so I think Morgan's got to go.  Ah, yeah.  You got a busy schedule today, Morgan?  He's got a hard out, as they say.  All day.  He has a hard out at 730.  A hard out.  Hard out.  Well, I don't know how you do it, but you continue to make movies, sir.  Dang.  He comes up and saying, I don't know how he does it. 
[01:19:30]  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Part of me is thinking Super Size.  That's a backhanded insult.  Wait a minute.  That sounds like my whole life.  Part of me, because we've known Morgan for a while.  When Super Size came out, I was like, this is a great movie, but is this a one-hit wonder?  You're proving to the world you're not a one-hit wonder, sir.  That's where I'm going with this.  Thank you.  And you guys got, come on, we've got a documentary with Collector Cups.  I see that.  Collector Cups in here.  Why not?  What's your next movie?  Are you starting to think of something?  No, we already shot it.  We shot it last summer.  Jesus.  We are.  I was pumping him out. 
[01:20:00]  I love Comic-Con.  I love comic books, so we went to San Diego Comic-Con and made a film about all the people  that go there.  We followed Cups, and it's great.  We're writing that right now.  Perfect.  I love watching those, man.  Perfect.  It's great.  Some people are fucking weird, man.  Very cool.  Morgan Spurlock.  Yeah, let's get him out of here.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  Thanks for a great day, man.  The movie's in theaters now.  The greatest movie ever sold.  Yeah, and then go on the website, thegreatestmovieeversold.com, to find out where it's playing near them.  Mike, can you plug in anything?  Yeah, we don't, Mike.  Uh, yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Thanks, Morgan.  No, you know what?  Thanks, Morgan.  Thanks, Morgan.  Not really.  Just, you know, big kudos to the agency and the teams for what they've done, but no,  I'm not plugging anything.  I'm a simple person.  I'm a simple man with a simple plan.  You got the tie on.  More TV for you today, sir?  Yes, as a matter of fact.  I'm all over the map.  That's awesome.  Good for you.  I'm doing Red Eye later in the month.  I hope you're on.  I always have a blast with you when you do that.  Yeah, I appreciate you saying that.  It's a lot of fun.  I just did it last night, and it was an all Bin Laden special last night.  Yeah, I'm sure. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, singing and dancing, and, you know, we had reminiscing.  We had some of his old friends come on and talk about it.  A variety show.  Yeah, yeah.  We're hoping Jimmy's going to lead a roast of the dead Bin Laden.  We need a break, so.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  The virus.  Sirius XM.

[01:21:30]  We should do Don't Tread on Me Today by Metallica.  That'd be a good one.  Morgan was cool to see you again, huh?  It's great.  Morgan Spurlock, always a pleasure to see Mike Baker.  Now we're going to take the other.  Mike's all man.  Yeah, he is.  He wears panties, though, just to balance it out.  Really?  Yeah.  From being too manly?  Yeah.  He's so manly, he's got to, like, dumb it down a little bit with some panties. 
[01:22:00]  You know what he'd be able to do, though?  Huh?  He would take the panties off.  And strangle you.  And choke you with it in a way that, like, you couldn't get out of it.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  And your neck would go like.  Of course.  Snap that neck.  Guy Fieri's coming later.  Cool.  He wrote a 52-pound book.  Yeah.  It could be the heaviest book ever.  Why don't you give it to Ozzy?  Yeah.  The book should be heavy if it's a Beatles book.  How thick is the paper that makes this book so heavy?  It's big. 
[01:22:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Guy Fieri is, I don't know, he's a big star now.  So I guess we've got to get big stars on our show.  It's important.  A minute to win at that guy.  And what was the other one?  The food show.  I've seen him on the Food Network and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He seems cool.  I've seen that guy.  I'm just not happy that the book weighs so fucking much.  I'm getting a six tattoo because I used to be in Team Six.  I'm supposed to talk about it.  Wait.  Wait.  You were on Navy SEAL Team Six?  Yeah.  Chip? 
[01:23:00]  Really?  Yes, I was.  You're not supposed to talk about it.  It's not.  You know.  Okay.  If you are, what was the real name of the team?  Huh?  See, it's not really Team Six.  It's just like what they give the press.  What was the real name?  Team Five.  That's the real name.  That's confusing.  Team Six is the one for the press.  Did you ever cap anybody?  Yeah.  Who?  A bunch of people.  Political Decidance.  Decidance.  I was over there.  I saw the shit. 
[01:23:30]  You were in the shit?  Yeah.  Do some missions.  I think Chip's lying again.  I hurt my knee.  You're sorry.  SEALs.  What are we all swimming in?  With balls in our noses or something.  The place was cracking up.  Tooting horns and stuff.  Yeah, but he's tooting a horn.  It makes your flippers.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Oh, Chip.  We have more audio of an Obama-Osama mistake.  Yeah.  This time around.  Oh, who did this?  Mr. Glenn Beck. 
[01:24:00]  You have to give President Obama credit.  He made the call.  Although, I don't think, hey, yeah, let's kill Obama is all that tough.  Or, I mean, bin Laden is all that tough of a call, but I'm not the one in that seat, you know?  Yeah, right.  Yeah, everybody's screwing up.  I was just saying before the break, I mean, before he came back, you know, I understand you've got to politicize this shit.  I understand that.  But one fucking day, and both sides did it, and I'm not just pointing at Fox and Glenn Beck. 
[01:24:30]  Everybody was doing it on TV yesterday.  It's like, can't we just all fucking just kind of relax and celebrate for one fucking day?  Everybody makes it about, like, I know Alex Jones did his thing, and look, that's his gig.  But wait a day or two is what I'm saying.  But the self-centeredness of it, it's like, do you have to make it about you?  Does everything that happens have to somehow get you some attention for yourself? 
[01:25:00]  It's fucking embarrassing.  Shut up.  Yeah, just like, you know, you don't want to politicize it.  But you can by, you know, waiting a few days and then going to ground zero and giving a speech about it.  Is that necessary, or is that posturing during a campaign?  I think it's kind of cool, though.  Now, any president, obviously, across the board, I would attract that from.  Some things are just symbolic.  Bush was there right after it happened.  Yeah, it was totally acceptable.  It was an amazing moment, and now having Obama down there? 
[01:25:30]  Of course it is, but we'll see how it plays out Thursday.  How about the Pentagon?  Just go there.  Yeah.  Closer to your house.  Don't fucking traffic here.  You just don't want the traffic problem, right?  Yeah.  That didn't have the symbolic effect anyway, because it's seen as a military building.  It sucked, but you didn't lose that many people.  There's no one jumping out the fucking 90th floor.  Right.  I was on the 30th floor of the building yesterday, looking out, just thinking, three times the  height of this.  People are leaping.  That sucks.  At least you get to lift three times longer.  Yeah, but you can shit your pants three times longer, too. 
[01:26:00]  It's not a pleasant ride down.  No.  I kind of agree with you there.  You lose more hair before you hit the ground.  Oh, please.  It's just horrible.  Alex Jones.  Sure.  Why not?  Ah, I believe he was frozen.  Ah.  I believe he was frozen.  Really?  Get Gordon's fish stick?  Fucking.  He's got a big audience.  He's got a big following, this Alex Jones, and he's exposing the Bin Laden hoax.  Well, the Bin Laden hoax already.  It's never real. 
[01:26:30]  Can't you just be happy for the country?  Nothing is ever real.  Does anything ever really just fucking happen?  No.  That's why...  Look, I don't believe everything that is told to me, certainly.  But, come on.  Sometimes things are just what they are.  Sometimes, yeah.  Things are real.  Maybe they exaggerate some of the points of how this whole thing went down, maybe.  But in the end, they fucking killed Osama a couple days ago.  Simple as that.  If your radio show is about conspiracy theories, then everything has to be a conspiracy. 
[01:27:00]  Everything.  Doesn't anybody see the connection between radio people making it about them?  There's a conspiracy about conspiracy shows.  Do you think...  It's true.  A show like Alex Jones, even just getting coffee, there's some kind of conspiracy?  Yeah, there's something fluoride in the water.  Does he just come into work and relax, but is everything a conspiracy?  Yeah.  Everything.  Does anybody tell you the truth? 
[01:27:30]  It's all lies.  No, he knows people that tell him the truth.  He's got all these connections.  Yeah, the big guy that came to him and asked him to spin it, and then I'm like, who was  it?  They didn't want to name him?  They can't name names.  Right.  They can never name names.  No, of course not.  Everybody else is supposed to name names, except them when they give you something like  some under-the-radar thing that happened, which boosters their image and their case and the  strength of their point.  But when you say name that person, they refuse to.  And that was the best part of Jesse Ventura's conspiracy show, which is now off the air, 
[01:28:00]  was he would have people on, so he would have to have their name.  And if you Googled them, you found out they were like nobody.  They had nothing to do with anything.  French players, right?  If that.  Very French.  If that.  Troy got me to watch that special where he supposedly revealed the JFK assassin.  That horse shit on a bridge with the guy.  Oh, it was fucking terrible.  It was terrible.  Terrible.  Why don't we start with Alex Jones? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Alex announces to the world, Jimmy, the bin Laden killing is a hoax.  Of course he does.  He was already dead.  President Obama addressed the nation late Sunday evening to say that just hours before,  Osama bin Laden had been killed in the middle of a major populated city in a palace compound.  My friends, this is a complete and total hoax, and we predicted with total precision,  with inside sources, going back more than eight years ago, what would happen? 
[01:29:00]  Can you pause that?  It's on record.  Who?  Who?  Who are your inside sources?  I can't name them.  Inside sources.  Wait, you have people with knowledge of the cover-up of the murder of bin Laden or whatever  it is eight years ago, and you're not going to name them because, what, you have journalistic  integrity?  Come on, man.  I understand, you know, you've got your livelihood on the line, so you don't want to name names,  but when it comes to the biggest fucking story that everyone's talking about in the world, 
[01:29:30]  it's time to name names.  What do you have to lose at this point?  When your whole job is to expose these evil conspiracies because you think there's a new  world order or whatever, how do you not?  This is not just entertainment value.  This is the new world order.  You're trying to change things.  Yeah, take away their power.  Name names.  But no, if they tell other people shit, you'll name their names, but if somebody comes to  you and tells you something, all of a sudden you're in the know, so you're not going to  name names?  Come on.  Sick of shit.  Boo.  Exactly what would happen. 
[01:30:00]  It's on record that Steve Pachinic, who worked as the top deputy to Henry Kissinger,  and who also is a high-level counsel on foreign relations member.  Kissinger.  Henry Kissinger.  I stand corrected.  Henry Kissinger.  He named a name.  Steve Pachinic.  Yeah.  Who worked with Kissinger.  Kissinger.  Okay.  How fucking long ago is this?  Kissinger was interviewed back in April of 2002 and said that bin Laden was dead and that 
[01:30:30]  was on ice and that in the future he would be used at a politically expedient time to  bolster the government in the eyes of the people.  Please, should you point out, can I ask, why is that guy more credible than the 10,000  people that say he's not dead?  Right.  Why is the one guy that worked for Kissinger credible?  Why don't you look at that guy and go, what an ass.  You just take his word for it, but everybody else and all the other information, you don't  weigh that against one guy that worked for Henry Kissinger? 
[01:31:00]  Why now to bring out Osama's body?  It's not even close to the election.  Yeah, it's not even close to the election.  Obviously, Obama's having problems right now in the polls.  So, all right, so let's say it boosts the polls now.  That doesn't mean shit 18 months from now.  When you do it a few months out?  Bush would have done it.  Bush would have done it during his presidency because he knew he was a hated president.  For his legacy, he would have done it.  Of course he would have done it.  Right.  And that would have guaranteed... 
[01:31:30]  On ice.  Really.  That's what they did.  That's what they did.  They saved him for the third year or the second and a half year of a Democratic presidency,  which is not going well.  Now let's do it right before the correspondence dinner.  What the fuck are you talking about?  That's really funny.  What's his name?  Did great with that, huh?  He was great.  Seth Meyers.  Seth Meyers.  Right, right, right. 
[01:32:00]  That stupid Donald Trump.  I said it to you before the show.  I loved your tweets yesterday, Jimmy.  Fucking Donald Trump's at this thing where it's supposed to be loose, loosey-goosey, a bunch  of laughs, and this guy can't laugh at himself with his pursed, lips, and everything else.  I can't...  I used to be very, you know, hey, he was okay.  This last few months has really made me really dislike him because what a...  Seth was funny, man.  Absolutely.  Oh, he talked like he had marbles in his mouth.  You fucking fat-faced, pursed-lipped idiot.  Stop trying to be intimidating with your dumb stare. 
[01:32:30]  Stop it.  I don't work for you.  You're not making everyone nervous.  Yeah.  What a baby that guy is.  Yeah, the shots of him in the crowd were unbelievable.  What a baby!  Why go to that event if you didn't feel like laughing and having a good time?  I'll tell you why.  Stay home.  He tried to play in the real political arena, and he was dismissed as he should have been  during a real speech when Obama referenced him as a sideshow on a carnival barker.  Fucking embarrassing.  Stop it.  Stop with that dumb, intense look on your face.  Alex Jones continues. 
[01:33:00]  Madeleine Albright.  We remember her.  Oh, of course.  And more unnamed sources say bin Laden was already dead.  Then Madeleine Albright in 2003, on December 17th, went on Fox News program and said that  he was dead and on ice and that the Bush administration was thinking about rolling him out during the  2004 election if they needed it.  But then because of that coverage, the inside baseball was they didn't. 
[01:33:30]  Now, even before she went public, a year and a half after I first broke this news, I had a White House source here in Austin, Texas.  You know, a lot of folks live here in Austin, but were also in the Bush administration because they came from Texas.  Bush had just been governor here.  And I was told by an extremely high level White House source this information separately.  Who?  I then confirmed through another White House source here in Austin through a separate party. 
[01:34:00]  Why would people continue to talk to Alex Jones?  They wouldn't.  Thank you.  By the way, I can.  I actually confirmed through a White House source that that those guys were trying to steer him on the wrong track because they weren't happy with Bush.  I confirmed that through another White House source because there's a lot of them that also come to New York because maybe they're from Texas, too.  But they also come to New York.  So I confirmed through a White House source that the guys he's talking about were just trying to mislead him to hurt Bush. 
[01:34:30]  I have a comment from a White House source.  There it is.  And I have a comment for that.  Boo!  That's kind of funny.  Why not?  White House source.  Alex Jones!  White House source.  Or something.  It's like a comment from a White House chief.  What does the White House dolphin say? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, he's probably going to get out of here.  I'm going to flip around on you or something.  That's what he said.  What's that?  I thought he was saying.  Chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp, chipp.  Alex Jones says the government lies.  No one believes Osama was buried at sea.  No one does, huh?  No one believes that.  Yeah, it makes no sense.  There's the government lying about WMDs and our destroyers being attacked to get us into Vietnam. 
[01:35:30]  You know this history of major hoaxes being run.  But notice when all this came out.  Then I'll go through some anomalies.  This is the tip of the iceberg.  This all came out right at the time that Obama's approval rating was dropping like a rock, an all-time low, this far into a president's administration.  As the dollar's dropping.  As support for Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and the drone attacks in Pakistan was imploding.  Right as the Pakistanis were threatening to kick the U.S. out of that. 
[01:36:00]  Please, approval rating for Bush about the war was much lower than it is for Obama with the war.  People are not happy, but they're not nearly as annoyed at him.  You don't see Libya being protested by people.  But you heard him say why they didn't roll him out for Bush.  Because Madeleine Albright had gone on some Fox News channel and given up the whole story about how he was on ice.  Sure.  So where's that audio?  Whoever they. 
[01:36:30]  Where is that audio?  Yeah, can we prove, he can prove that by just playing, why wouldn't, as he's talking about the Madeleine Albright, we do radio, obviously.  Yeah.  So we know how this game works.  So you're saying Madeleine Albright went on TV and.  Can we look that up, Danny?  And exposed all that.  So as a radio host, why wouldn't you play that audio right there?  Absolutely.  Why would you not play it there?  Because did she talk in vagary or something, and that's what he took away from it?  As a radio host, you play the audio right there.  Of course you do.  It strengthens your cause, and it's more interesting, and it makes what you're saying sound much more legit. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, he's not a lazy radio guy.  Of course you play it at that point.  Because now we're going to search it out, and we'll play it.  We're threatening to kick the U.S. out of Pakistan and to kick their drones out.  Right as this happens, there's this big propaganda victory, and what do they do?  They take the body and throw it in the ocean, they say.  Do you really believe that?  No one is buying that.  I've been listening to talk radio last night and this morning.  Even conservative stations that want to buy into this propaganda, no one is buying that. 
[01:37:30]  I absolutely believe it, and I think it was a very fucking smart move.  Smartest move you can make.  And I'm sure video will be released.  I don't know if you're going to be able to see Osama's face or anything.  He's probably going to be wrapped up and all that, right?  I don't know.  Maybe it's a law-informed video where they kind of show some of the stuff that went on on the ship before they dumped his body.  These conspiracy guys are so fucking wrapped up in their own themselves. 
[01:38:00]  The self-centeredness of it, it's always got to be about them.  Never once does anything play out.  I understand that they're right about some stuff, but nothing is ever what it's ever.  They kept the body on ice.  And you know how this stuff works.  They only release a little bit of stuff at a time.  So you're going to get the death photo, and you're certainly going to get more videos. 
[01:38:30]  Won't matter.  They'll find a reason to not.  No, I understand that.  But he's basically saying, look, you know, this is, it sounds a little crazier now before, sure, we get the videos and the pictures.  Yeah.  But that will be released.  Did you find something?  That's from C-SPAN?  Because all I see is, in 2003, former U.S. Clinton Administrator Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Fox News analyst Morton Kovrak,  she suspected Bush knew the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and was waiting for the most politically expedient moment to announce his capture. 
[01:39:00]  Now, that's, regardless if she even said that or not, I don't know, because people are questioning, now, why would Albright, a sane woman, say something crazy like that?  But nothing about him being on ice.  But where is, where's the audio?  Why is the audio not up?  Danny's listening to something right now.  Yeah, he's going to find out.  That's her explaining why she looks the way she looks.  She's less than 400 years old.  Look, I wouldn't be surprised if you, a big event like that, if you could time it, you know, to help yourself out. 
[01:39:30]  I bet you would.  I get it.  There's no way you're.  But you're not, but he's not on ice.  This is what, by the way, people forget.  All of this shit, like the presidents are keeping.  Where was all of this amazing presidential power during Watergate when a fucking security guard brought down the,  that little dumb thing from those renter security guards ended the presidency of the United States? 
[01:40:00]  Where?  Yeah.  You bring up a great point, and last night I was watching all the coverage.  I was all over the place, and one of the stations had Colin Powell on, and they basically said, Colin Powell.  Yeah, pretty fucking powerful guy, right?  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.  Like, how did you find out about Osama bin Laden?  You know what his answer was?  My wife told me because she heard it on the news.  On the news.  That's Colin Powell.  You would assume there's still some kind of network in place where you might tell Colin Powell what just went down. 
[01:40:30]  But he, on TV last night, said, oh, no, my wife heard it on the news, and she called me.  That was amazing to me.  Which goes back to your point.  You just assume that it's this big and powerful thing, and sometimes it's just what it is.  Colin Powell had to find out from his wife that they got Osama bin Laden because she heard it on the news.  Who's hiding bin Laden, frozen on ice for years?  Who the fuck is doing that for any reason?  Especially a couple years ago when there was way more outrage about us being in Iraq and Afghanistan than there is right now. 
[01:41:00]  It's just what he's saying is just not true there.  And do you understand the Nixon thing?  The president had to resign his office because they could not control that little.  And information was not passed back then the way it is right now.  And that spun out of control.  Bill Clinton almost lost his presidency over getting his dick sucked.  They couldn't shut up a fucking fat girl who took a load on the dress.  Right.  The most powerful guy on the planet could not shut up her or her fucking fat friend Linda Tripp. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, why are they found dead somewhere or it disappeared?  Yeah, the president's murder, JFK.  Oh, that's easy to cover up.  Bin Laden on ice, they can cover that up.  Fat chick sucks his dick.  Yeah, why allow her to live?  God, you're right.  Stupid intern.  Are you kidding me?  If all this shit goes down like some of these conspiracy guys think, she would have been long gone.  Look at what's happening to us.  That fucking ugly Linda Tripp would have been long gone. 
[01:42:00]  Of course she would have.  Or in England, who's the guy?  It would have been some kind of hiking accident, I'm thinking.  A little pusheroo.  Would have gotten rid of her somehow.  Of course.  Well, you don't think that when Colin Powell was in the UN saying that they had uranium,  that that was definitely uranium?  Would it turn out to be a fucking good humor truck?  Yeah, that they couldn't plant it.  It was only our guys there.  These guys drive me nuts because they only will talk about it one way.  They never look at any evidence.  Do you find it fascinating that's how Colin Powell found out? 
[01:42:30]  It blew me away last night because he was...  He's not in this circle anymore.  No, I understand that.  But you would just think he would be close enough where someone would give him...  I mean, when a dumb radio thing happens, we get calls, right?  Yeah.  Because we're in the business.  You'd think he's still kind of in the peripheral business.  It turns out, no.  They really clammed up on this one.  Huh?  They really clammed up on this.  This is the same government that's constantly caught lying. 
[01:43:00]  But conveniently, his body is now out in the ocean somewhere, buried at sea.  But it gets worse.  Last night, as soon as this was announced, it was all over U.S. TV, British TV, European papers.  There's fake photos.  And as soon as I saw it, I sent text messages to Paul Watson and others and said...  Hey, asshole.  That's not...  It's the one Photoshop picture.  We all know it's fake.  That didn't come from the government.  No.  Somebody fakes a Photoshop? 
[01:43:30]  What a fucking...  Asshole.  And the media did go with it at one point, maybe.  They're assholes.  Yeah, they're idiots.  But something like that starts at, you know, somebody blogs it.  That was just somebody doing it.  And everybody started passing around going, look, it's in the picture.  And then quickly, yesterday, a lot of places said, that's a fake photo, Alex Jones.  You know that.  Oh, by the way, still being sent that picture today.  Oh, I know.  Probably dummies.  I'm embarrassed for everybody on Twitter still sending that around.  Posted.  As a picture of Osama Bin Laden dead. 
[01:44:00]  Stop.  You're embarrassing yourself.  I sent text messages to Paul Watson and others and said, look into this.  This is the same fake Bin Laden dead photo that's Photoshopped of him that we saw years ago.  And so digging into this, we've learned they claim that they've killed him nine separate times.  But obviously, this is the big presidential announcement.  They claim that they've killed...  Who's they and where's the audio?  If there's audio that exists. 
[01:44:30]  They've said they thought they had him.  Right.  They also said that about Al Zarqawi when they were chasing him.  They thought they had him when they got his laptop one time.  They always think they have these guys.  And the same way as Bush made that stupid announcement that the victory was won.  They do make announcements they shouldn't make.  Right.  Which is even more embarrassing because then they have to take it back.  Right.  Because a new tape comes out.  Bush was embarrassed by that one.  He admitted it.  What happened?  Mission accomplished.  What happened the nine times?  Yeah.  Why didn't they just...  Well, if they had nine times, what was this all before they actually had him on ice? 
[01:45:00]  They wanted to roll him out, as you said.  Big presidential announcement.  They claim that they've killed other Al-Qaeda operatives over and over again.  They're training you to accept this type of garbage.  So we've got that information that they've killed him nine times.  It's got to be hard, in fairness to Alex Jones, to fill 20 hours a week.  Of conspiracy radio.  Of nothing but conspiracy.  Well, his mistake was making his show all about conspiracies instead of it being a part of his show. 
[01:45:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Because now there's more to talk about.  You make it a part of his show, then you can free yourself to talk about other shit.  It's black and white.  Yeah.  But I just don't know why.  Did Alex Jones...  Maybe he's been saying it all along.  But has he been saying that bin Laden is dead all along?  And by the way, if bin Laden was dead all along, well, Al-Qaeda knew that.  So why would they allow these tapes to come out?  Or why wouldn't they just get a new leader?  Like, I don't understand that.  I just don't comprehend it. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Does anybody believe him on the phone?  I mean, he's got a big following.  The phones are lit.  Right.  So we'll go to them after this last call.  But Alex Jones exposes this PR move and fits some plugs in for his website and radio show.  Where's he does?  Infowars.com.  We got it.  Got it.  Right as our country's being imploded.  Right as the world government's being announced.  Right as we go into the Depression.  Here's this PR move about, boy, we're walking a little taller today.  Got a spring in my step. 
[01:46:30]  It's all a Wag the Dog Hollywood production.  My friends, we'll continue to cover all the other developments.  There's so much more at Infowars.com.  Of course.  On the live radio show.  There you go.  Boom.  And the video feed at PrisonPlanet.tv.  Of course.  So continue to watch Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.  We've got about a million people roughly hitting the site an hour right now.  This is the biggest news story we've ever been involved in, obviously, is the whole world.  I was looking for answers to what's happened, but that's just some of the points, and more 
[01:47:00]  and more anomalies are coming out, and they announced this on a Sunday night, so they  dominate the news cycle this week, but already people are not buying into it across the board.  It is a fairy tale.  If you believe this.  I do.  Then I've got a bridge.  I'm wanting to sell you.  Good.  Where?  By the Brooklyn.  And I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona.  Oh, nice.  By the way.  For the news cycle, if you announce this on a Friday, don't worry.  It has legs.  That makes you sound smarter when you say news cycle.  Here's the thing.  So, you know how you're saying the Depression. 
[01:47:30]  Like in 2008, when the stock market was shitting the bed and banks were closing, why wouldn't  they fucking haul them out then?  Roll them out then.  That's how you distract people.  Right.  But they didn't.  They didn't roll them out then.  They roll them out now.  When General Motors was going bankrupt and needed government money and all that was going  And all the bankers, the conspiracy of bankers, why didn't they roll them out then?  To take the focus on themselves.  When the Dow was under 10,000, when, you know, how about, how about then?  Why roll it out after Obama shows the birth certificate? 
[01:48:00]  Why not spread these two events out?  Because the dumb birth certificate, I would imagine, helped Obama a little bit, right?  Yeah.  So why not spread that out?  Why go one, two like that?  It's just, there's no reason to do it right now.  You would do it.  It's a fury.  Why do you let all those Democrats get the shit kicked out of them in those midterm elections?  You lose a big part of your power base.  Why not do it right before those?  So it'll look like, hey, the Democrats are strong on, why would you do it now when it  means nothing?  Yeah.  Keep them strong for the elections coming up.  You're right.  Idiocy.  But again, because the conspiracy thing is the entire show, they have to find a way 
[01:48:30]  to marry whatever is going on into what their thing is.  The facts don't matter.  Hey, how's it going?  Just to point more a fact that conspiracy theories most of the time are bullshit, I did an interview  with Bill Clinton.  I really don't remember where it is, but it's online somewhere.  I think it was like a Japanese college where he talked about how when he became president,  something he wanted to see so badly was Area 51, and he insisted upon seeing it.  And then, you know, basically he found out that there was no aliens in Area 51. 
[01:49:00]  There was no secrets in Area 51.  Yes, there was.  Area 51.  Area 51.  You knew then, and you did nothing.  You had a spaceship, and you left it there.  Maybe David could fly.  You know nothing.  David's got filled the fish on the plane.  Ah, Air Force One.  Very nice.  Very nice. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, Judd.  Got someone on Twitter saying, Cheney said yesterday on Fox News he learned about it in  the newspaper yesterday morning.  Yeah, there you go.  It's weird that those guys...  No, he didn't.  He's so full of shit.  That's where Cheney's lying, because Bush got a call from Obama.  So Bush would call Cheney right away, right?  So Bush would call Cheney right away, right?  Fucking Cheney didn't know.  Bush and Cheney, not on the best of terms.  Maybe Cheney wasn't.  Not on the best of terms.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Probably didn't call him.  Maybe not.  Oh, really?  They're not?  No.  I didn't know that.  Not on the best of terms.  I didn't know that.  Hey, one of our guys believes this shit.  No, he doesn't. 
[01:50:00]  Troy does.  Troy likes conspiracies, but I don't believe that Troy actually thinks that Bin Laden  has been on ice.  Get Troy in here.  And I don't want Troy to adjust his shit, because we just beat up Alex Jones for 15 minutes.  No, I just think it's interesting.  I want to take on this thing.  All right.  I like Troy.  Here comes Troy.  Troy Kwan.  Troy.  There it is.  Don't adjust your shit now.  Okay?  I want to hear your take on this thing.  We should have had you in a soundproof booth, so you didn't hear the Alex Jones stuff, but... 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I mean, look, Alex Jones has his agenda just like everybody else, and, you know, it's  just the one thing that kind of bothers me is, you know, personally, I want to see the  body.  I want to see it for myself.  I believe we're going to see it.  I mean, have it lay in state somewhere so you could file by and look at it, or a picture.  Well, you know, this guy orchestrated one of the greatest terrorist attacks on our soil.  Sure.  Yes.  And all of a sudden, we care about his...  He did this in the name of God.  Okay? 
[01:51:00]  We didn't care about his religious beliefs.  He did this in the name of God.  Right.  And now we're going to respect his beliefs?  No.  I don't believe that either.  We used that to our advantage.  Yeah, that's the lie.  That's the lie.  That's the bullshit.  That's the bullshit, because then no one could question that.  We did what was supposed to be done for his faith.  Do you think it would be nice to have his body laying around somewhere so that people  can use it as some kind of a rally point for...  A martyrdom thing or a shrine. 
[01:51:30]  It would be a focal point, and people would go to it.  It would just...  Now he's in the wind.  He's nowhere.  You ask anybody that's lost a loved one and has never been able to recover a body, it's  probably the most frustrating thing, that they don't have a place to go to put flowers  and kind of feel like they're closer with that person.  It's a perfect thing for this government to have done.  It's a genius move.  Why wouldn't you drag the guy's body through the streets of New York?  No, you can't do that.  That's good for a movie, but we don't do that, man. 
[01:52:00]  That makes us as bad as them.  It's just convenient that it just...  It disappeared.  It's in the ocean.  It is convenient.  Don't you think that the strategy of that is genius?  Like, the government's not interested in posturing.  Like, don't you think the genius of not giving a rally place...  And if you take him alive, then all of a sudden, every fucking radical is pulling in hostages,  demanding the shapes release.  Saying, release him.  It's a no-win.  Or we kill him.  I look at it a little bit differently.  You know?  I think that people would like closure and like to see his body and what he did, and send  a message to every motherfucker that thinks about fucking with this country. 
[01:52:30]  I think the government understands that, too, but also realizes that that's a big risk.  They'll release the photo.  They'll release photos.  They're going to release videos, I have no doubt.  It's unfortunate that the news is playing up.  Like, they're talking to some of the victims' families, and like, well, my loved one didn't  get a proper burial, so...  You know, but that wasn't the government's intention.  Of course not.  They were using that to their advantage, to make this whole fucking thing disappear.  Make him disappear.  He's gone.  He's gone, man.  And now that's a frustrating feeling for a lot of people. 
[01:53:00]  And it takes something away from these radical clerics who...  They want to spin this some way, but they can't spin it negatively, like, about certain...  Because the body...  Like, they know that Islamic law was quote-unquote respected, so they can't say, where's his  body?  Right.  We want his body.  Because they know that, hey, look, they buried him within 24 hours.  That's what you guys want.  And it kind of puts them in a place where they have nothing to say about it.  And we wouldn't win the other way, because people say, oh, wow, you don't respect our  religion.  You know, he should have been buried within 24 hours. 
[01:53:30]  So it's almost a no-win situation either way.  I hear you.  But with that said, they realized, wow, we could take advantage of this.  Emotionally, I agree with you.  Would we love to see this cocksucker drag like Mussolini?  But Hitler's body was never taken.  We know Hitler's dead.  But his body...  Where's Hitler's body?  Oh.  Burned up in a bunker.  No, he's dead now.  Argentina.  He's dead now.  Well, they have a skull, don't they?  Old age.  Yeah.  I don't think they do, no.  I think they do.  I think they have a skull somewhere.  Do they have Hitler's skull?  There's a rumor that the Russians had it for quite a while.  There's a rumor, but I'm saying it hasn't been...  I don't know.  It's always one of those things that people... 
[01:54:00]  Is it true?  Is it not true?  Well, just check for the mustache.  Yeah.  Check his skull and see if the mustache is Hitler.  There's Hitler.  So he's alive well.  He's hanging out.  He's at a cafe.  God, that guy looks like him.  Troy, what's your other issues here?  With what?  With this?  I mean, that's pretty much it.  Look, I don't get too deep into what Alex...  I like Alex Jones.  I think he's great.  I really do.  I think he's entertaining.  I don't...  You know, I have a problem believing anybody. 
[01:54:30]  I have a problem believing people that I associate with every single day.  So let alone a government, let alone anybody else.  But is it so unbelievable that after almost 10 years, they threw intelligence, found out  where the guy lived, landed a strike team in there, and killed him?  I mean, it happens.  It's a little hard to believe because we're the greatest country in the world.  You tell me it takes 10 years to find the guy?  Well, yeah.  But no, no.  Do you see what Troy said?  And I know what you mean.  But there is that thought process in people who are into conspiracies. 
[01:55:00]  Like, it's hard to imagine that this great, safe place of ours can't catch this guy.  Yeah.  We're not all that amazing with some things.  We can close a deal really well.  They know where you are right now because of your phone.  They know how to track everybody.  They have every square inch of this earth calculated.  So play it on your head.  What happened?  Calculate it.  Did we kill him two days ago?  I mean, your guess is as good as mine.  I mean, that's what...  No, I'm not guessing.  That's what...  I believe in my soul we killed him two days ago.  I'm not guessing. 
[01:55:30]  Are you telling us?  I'm not guessing.  So we might as well believe it.  If it helps you sleep better at night...  So what do you think?  I mean, he's dead.  That he was frozen for 10 years?  I have no idea, man.  But dude, he didn't have any...  Those connections you mean where they could trace you, he didn't have that stuff.  He was smart.  He's a smart dude.  And he had fiercely loyal religious people around him.  These couriers would have died for him.  They didn't give him up for the money.  What if you see a video in the coming weeks of him actually being shot in the head in the compound?  Then I don't believe it.  Or would you?  Or would you say that's a lookalike?  I mean, if it looks legit, you know?  I mean, I would rather see that than just have that thing tell me, oh yeah, this is what happened. 
[01:56:00]  Well, I understand that to a point.  But what is it going to take for you to believe?  But what does it matter if I believe one way or the other?  Really, at the end of the day...  It matters because I think you represent a lot of people that think just like you.  You're not like a lone wolf on this.  There's a lot of people that don't believe we got...  What is it about the conspiracy that gives you comfort?  There's something about it, about the concept of it, that comforts you for some reason. 
[01:56:30]  As I've told you before, I don't trust anybody.  And there is an agenda with our government.  And they're going to do whatever it takes.  And they have the ability to create smoke and mirrors and have this happen and have that happen.  Is it really, though?  Is it the truth?  I don't know.  I couldn't tell you.  Does the government really have the ability to do all that?  There's too many individuals.  They're not a Borg-type collective.  There's too many individuals that love talking.  People love a good story. 
[01:57:00]  They love talking.  So how is secrets kept?  They're not...  Like Jimmy brought up Watergate earlier.  I mean, that was just, you know, fuck up.  And then people open in their mouths.  And then people want to save their own asses.  And it snowballed into, you know, Tricky Dick giving the old peace sign and hopping on the helicopter and getting the fuck out of it.  And you don't think we've learned from that?  You don't think there's a pyramid, a hierarchy, and the top knows what's going on and gives the orders and tells everybody else below what's going on?  But he was the top.  How come they couldn't stop Lewinsky or Linda Tripp? 
[01:57:30]  That's a great point.  That's not that long ago.  Dude, that's not that long ago, and the effect they had on the government was huge.  Well, they allowed the fucking chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to humiliate himself and make the U.S. look terrible in the fucking U.N.  They couldn't control that.  Like, when people look at all of these major things that happen, and they just, the conspiracy guys never balance that and go, oh, yeah, that type of shit does happen there, too.  How about Iraq just fly into the middle of a barren desert that we control every inch of, fly in a few drums of fucking nerve gas, bury them in the desert somewhere, and then say, ah, look what we found. 
[01:58:00]  Complete justification for the war.  Why not do that?  If they're such liars and so good at cover-ups, why have to come back with the tail between legs and go, ah, wow, we found fucking nothing here.  We look like idiots.  When it would have been the easiest thing to say, we found nerve gas, here it is.  Yeah, and then you look good in the eyes in front of the whole world. 
[01:58:30]  You probably do get a coalition of other countries to help you because they're like, okay, at least the U.S. found it so we don't look bad helping them.  And he was known to have used nerve gas against his own people, so it wouldn't have been out of the blue, would have been something like people would have went, oh, wow, yeah.  But we didn't.  We went, oh, we told him, oh, we couldn't find it.  Change the reason for the war, democracy.  I'm going to go with Troy for a second.  Maybe Obama drags out Osama's frozen body now because he wasn't invited to the royal wedding.  Ah, perfect. 
[01:59:00]  Perfect.  That's it.  No one's talking about the royal wedding anymore because Obama was pissed he didn't get the invite.  It's all about the killing.  I don't believe everything I see on TV, Troy, certainly.  Yeah.  I mean, I think some of the details probably exaggerated, certainly.  And look, I believe we landed some chompers and fucking shot that motherfucker in the head.  I'm not trying to sell you guys on anything.  I completely believe that.  Everybody's entitled to believe whatever they want to believe.  Whatever helps get you through the day.  Whatever helps get you through this life.  But it's not helping getting through life. 
[01:59:30]  You know, the boogeyman's dead.  You know what I mean?  No, here's the thing.  When you say whatever helps you sleep at night, it's not helping me sleep at night.  It's just another thing that I heard.  It's helping you sleep at night to think that you're so fucking up on this that you are part of this elite group that knows, man.  You know.  We're just sheep.  And it doesn't help me sleep at night.  I could give a shit.  I sleep just fine. 
[02:00:00]  But for you, I'm saying to you, it helps you sleep at night thinking that you know something that all of us are too dumb to know.  And I'm not saying that at all.  And I'm not researching everything and telling you all these facts of this guy said this and this guy said that.  You know, I just, I question what is being told to me.  And I don't have to believe that.  Let me ask you this.  Why now?  Let's say, let's say Osama was frozen.  Why bring it out now?  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, your guess is as good as mine.  But you live in that world, so you should research on that stuff.  You want to know why?  Because why now? 
[02:00:30]  Because logically, it would seem like Jimmy had a couple options and or certainly closer to the election.  People are sort of not going to, how can I explain it?  It's not going to be as hot when it's close to the election as it is right now.  Yeah.  You know, I have so much going on in my own life.  What does it matter if I research it other than to, you know, I mean, I'm so busy as it is, so I don't need to add that to my life. 
[02:01:00]  Don't you want to, that's the kind of, you're kind of making my point for me in a roundabout way is that conspiracy becomes this thing that people marry themselves to.  Like when the Pentagon, I thought I saw a loose change.  Hey, there's a couple of really good questions they raised.  Because they do raise good questions, sure.  I didn't have the knowledge to go against it, but just because I don't know it doesn't mean it's that way.  So I remember talking and saying, let's get those guys on and let's see what they have to say about this.  Because they raised a few questions in my mind about that fucking plane hitting the Pentagon. 
[02:01:30]  And then I listened to them.  I listened to other people.  I saw photos.  Ant went through a brilliant thing about when they, all the things that they got wrong.  And it was like, you know what?  I weighed both sides.  The fucking loose change guys are full of shit.  They're wrong.  But I wasn't afraid to weigh both sides.  Why are conspiracy guys afraid to, like, why go, it's a conspiracy?  I don't want to know.  I don't want to research.  Like, I did my homework on that.  And I really did look at the other side.  And I really did listen to them.  And I just didn't buy what they said. 
[02:02:00]  I want to clarify.  I've never come out and said I was a conspiracy theorist.  I just don't trust anybody.  That's what I've said from the get-go.  Trust issues?  Extreme trust issues.  I trust no one.  What is that?  Why?  That's the bigger issue.  Why?  Don't touch young Troy.  Who was supposed to be a person in your life who was good and just gave you a little fucking...  Supposed to protect you.  A little tug.  Yeah, maybe a little tug.  No, I don't know.  I mean, it's just, you know, I do love that Jimmy thinks every single person in this room  was touched.  He brings it up a lot. 
[02:02:30]  Of course they have.  And then Danny just said, lose change guys have had to edit and re-edit their movie due  to new information.  Of course they have.  It's embarrassing.  Yeah, you have to mold it into the facts.  You've got to mold your conspiracy because the facts have come out.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  But I mean, you know, you look at something like 9-11.  Okay, cool.  This is what they tell us has happened.  Okay, fine.  Black boxes.  Where are they?  They're gone.  They just disappeared.  But we found a passport.  It's just those little things that you're like, oh, really? 
[02:03:00]  How does that all make sense?  You know?  You know what makes sense?  It's probably easier for a passport to survive.  Than black boxes that survive everything else?  Nothing's ever had to.  Well, you wouldn't believe the black box is easy because they would just, dude, if they  could orchestrate what these people think that they've orchestrated, you think they  couldn't fix the black box?  It would prove their case.  They have their traffic control radio back and forth.  You can't tell me that doesn't make sense.  A black box, they found nothing.  There was rubble and dust.  So all that shit that just turned into desks, computers, chairs, bathrooms, everything turned 
[02:03:30]  into a fine dust.  People, just dust.  They didn't find shit there as far as, you know how much office equipment was in the World  Trade Center?  They didn't find any of it.  It doesn't mean that someone secretly removed all the furniture the day before.  It just means that so much energy was being expelled at that moment that everything turned  to dust, including the plane, the black box. 
[02:04:00]  Except the passport.  The only things that lived.  But you know what?  But an explosion blew that out.  Let me tell you something.  There was also a fuckload of paperwork from the World Trade Center that blew past my apartment  in Brooklyn.  Blew past my apartment.  Paper would more readily survive because if it's, you know, it floats down slower.  It got out of the building.  So a passport coming out?  I could see that.  An explosion blow.  I actually have a piece of paper from the Trade Center. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, there was a lot of it all over the place.  Yeah, that was from the 150th, or 150th, 110th floor, whatever it was.  And I saved it because an explosion, you have something in a bag?  It happens.  The plane crashes into building.  The passport's probably in the guy's bag that's with him.  Sure.  Could have been in front of the plane, flies out.  I mean, come on.  Oh, no.  But see, these are little things that I have a hard time putting all together in my head.  But you take the mountain of evidence and ignore it for the one little anomaly which  any investigation will have or any case will have anomalies.  It's not one case criminally or anything. 
[02:05:00]  It just goes 100%.  There's always weird little things that you can't explain that.  But a conspiracy theorist will take that little grain of salt and use it to somehow explain  away a mountain of evidence from the other direction.  And that's why I can't buy – I find that – and I don't mean like you're not an honest  guy, but I find that the idea of a lot of these conspiracies is based in something  that's self – what's the word?  Not selfish, but there's a self-motivation there. 
[02:05:30]  It's comforting them.  It's doing something like that.  Get it back to Osama bin Laden and Alex Jones.  Why didn't he play the audio of Albright?  I can't answer that for Alex.  But you work in radio, obviously.  Yeah.  So if you have this evidence, why wouldn't you play for your listeners to really hammer  your point home?  That would make sense.  Do you have it, Dan?  And also, really fast, too, there was another point by Alex Jones that I want to make clear.  He says that they did it on a Sunday to get the news cycle.  No one was awake on the East Coast.  Most of us were in bed.  Do you really think they need to announce it to get the news cycle? 
[02:06:00]  You know, it's Monday morning as everyone's waking up.  It's going to make the news no matter.  It makes the morning newspaper.  No one cares about the newspaper.  Everyone reads the drugs report in Huffington Post.  That's immediate.  They love these pictures, though.  Everyone was celebrating in the middle of the night.  Kenny picks me up.  I'm like, wow, I really thought it's stupid me because we work pretty close to Times Square.  I'm thinking in my head, we might have a tough time getting in the building this morning.  They're still celebrating. 
[02:06:30]  Guess what?  There wasn't a soul in Times Square when we pulled up at 530.  Not a soul.  So if you're going to orchestrate this thing, wouldn't it be Monday morning?  Now you've got Times Square packed all day, Ground Zero packed all day.  I would think having that is probably more important than having people hang out in Times Square.  I'm just going with what Alex Jones has said, you know, perfect news cycle.  It wasn't a perfect news cycle when the news hit at 11 o'clock on a Sunday night.  Yeah, but it was just in time enough to make the morning papers.  No, it wasn't.  It was on the papers yesterday.  It was. 
[02:07:00]  It was more of a pain in the ass.  They had to call people back.  As a matter of fact, I believe the Wall Street Journal didn't have it because they couldn't get back and redo their paper.  Most papers were able to do it.  You're right.  But some papers were not, but it wasn't it wasn't perfect timing.  It's not 1965.  Most people fucking everyone goes to the Drudge Report and the and the new papers now are almost they're a day behind on everything.  Oh, yeah, they are like it's not the old days, man.  It's all immediate news on your phone on the Internet.  I realize, you know, we've been preparing for this radio show for many years by reading the newspapers. 
[02:07:30]  I realize I now just do it out of habit because I'm looking at stuff going.  I already know this.  I know this.  I know this.  Like, like I have ESP or something.  I don't know.  I'm like, I know all this stuff already.  Why is it in today's paper?  You're supposed to get new stuff.  News.  That's why they call it new.  Right.  Nothing's new anymore in newspapers.  New.  It's old paper.  It's a good one.  Former Secretary of State Malinova, we said it before, told Fox News analyst Morton Kondrack yesterday she suspects President Bush knows the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and simply is waiting for the most politically expedient moment to announce his capture. 
[02:08:00]  Kondrack made the announcement about what Albright told him backstage before an appearance on another Fox show on a special report with Brit Hume.  So she never said it on the air.  This is this guy saying what Madeleine Albright said backstage. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  And he's saying that that she said it on a Fox News interview show.  Yes.  So maybe there's no audio of it.  Right.  There's no audio of it.  So maybe either A, she believed it or B, she says, like, oh, yeah, he's probably just waiting.  You know, no, he's waiting to jump on ice and he'll break him out.  I mean, it's after some further reading, it said that while when she was asked about those statements that she had made, she said that she had made them.  But she was clearly joking, yet Morton Kondrack or whatever his name is, claims that there was no sign of a smile on her face. 
[02:09:00]  You ever see her face?  No sign of anything there.  But no, that's who she's going to say it to.  You need moisture to smile.  Yes.  Moisture's gone.  That's who she'd say it to for real.  That guy from Fox who would talk about it.  Right.  That's exactly how it would work.  Brilliant, Alex.  But Alex takes that and lies.  Sure he does.  And so is on a Fox News program.  I guess technically it was a Fox News program. 
[02:09:30]  She was getting ready to go on one.  Because his fan base isn't going to research this.  They're just going to repeat what he said to other people.  But why all of a sudden is this guy from Fox credible now?  Now, why all of a sudden is Alex Jones saying that Fox is a credible source of news?  I realize Fox is opinionated.  But why all of a sudden when Fox is nothing but a propaganda machine to that guy now, because she said something backstage and this guy repeated it,  now all of a sudden Fox is the most credible place in the world.  It's bullshit.  I can almost believe if Bush knew where Osama bin Laden was, he could use it to his advantage politically almost. 
[02:10:00]  But there's also incredible risk if he fucking blows it.  Yeah.  If all of a sudden, you know, Osama moves or what has you?  What has you?  What has you?  Excuse me.  When you're hunting the fucking, the biggest enemy of the United States, you have military commanders to listen to.  There is nobody you can sit down with and go, hey, look, I'm not doing well on the polls.  These guys have soldiers being blown up.  They don't give a fuck.  These guys go way beyond the polls because, again, the conspiracy theorists want it both ways. 
[02:10:30]  They say that the president is kind of a puppet and being told, but then bin Laden is fucking captured and make it look like the president orchestrated it for his own good.  So which is it?  And I believe they got a lot of video and pictures right now, but the administration is going to take their time and spread this out a little bit.  And they watched it.  Because they're going to take advantage of it now.  Yes.  Why wouldn't you?  Why would you put everything right up front?  Like, here's everything.  Boom.  Just release it a little piece today, a little piece tomorrow.  Take the weekend off. 
[02:11:00]  We'll do a little more on Monday.  I believe that shit.  Sure.  They're going to take their time with it now.  But I guess Fox is all of a sudden, I guess today, because Madeline Albright said something joking backstage to a guy who I'm sure that she would have confided in.  Because that's what you do.  You confide with a guy on Fox backstage.  Like Jesse Jackson when he sent Hi-Me-Town to a reporter.  Right.  And couldn't believe the reporter, Milton, whatever his name was, went public with it.  Like, do you think these people are that stupid that they're going to say something?  She was having a moment with a guy joking around, and this motherfucker took it and made it about himself. 
[02:11:30]  And, oh, guess what she just said?  Get the fuck out of here.  Alex also says the birth certificate's bullshit.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Well, I mean, there's a whole list of reasons why he gives, you know.  I mean, starting with, he was said as black on the birth certificate.  At that time, you would have said Negro.  Or he said African, I believe, on the birth certificate.  And at that time, you would have said Negro.  Negro.  And there was a couple other things that.  But even, like, the Republicans have backed down from that issue. 
[02:12:00]  This is just what he said.  I don't know.  I love hearing it when you guys mix it up with them.  I really do.  But don't you think it's interesting?  I'm not selective, like, in the way I process information.  That's what bothers me about conspiracy guys.  To me, they're not straight shooters.  They fucking don't process it the same on both sides.  I don't discount everything that looks weird.  They discount everything that doesn't go with what they want.  And thank you, Nathan Brimmer on Twitter.  Yeah, Wall Street Journal gave out free papers yesterday because they didn't have the fucking story. 
[02:12:30]  So, like, here.  Here's a free paper today.  We fucked up.  We didn't get it out in time.  And it's like no one gives a shit about the post.  I mean, it's the news cycle.  There's 24-hour.  Fox, CNN, headline news are 24-hour news machines.  That is a great point.  But also, an Osama bin Laden dead thing goes way beyond a news cycle.  Of course it does.  We'll be talking about this for months. 
[02:13:00]  But, again, he had to explain why it got announced.  Now, instead of going, this is when it happened and this is when they announced it.  Again, when you're in that world, it's all about you and somehow taking that little grain of fucking assault and fucking ignoring this mountain of evidence.  So you have to make it about you, and that's how you explain it.  I want to get Roger on from Hartford.  All right.  Welcome aboard, Roger.  Hartford.  Roger, what's up?  Good morning, Mike.  Roger.  Roger.  Hello.  Jimmy, do you think it's outside the realm of possibility that all the details of this are as they're being portrayed? 
[02:13:30]  No.  Like one detail I think could have been betrayed differently, unless maybe the video will say it wouldn't surprise me, like I said, if his own bodyguard had killed him for martyrdom because he didn't want to be captured alive.  That was a fact I said immediately could have been not true.  I don't know for a fact if it is or not.  Okay.  So I guess the only point I had was I wasn't understanding your argument, for one. 
[02:14:00]  And secondly, I think it's a little curious, just slightly curious.  Obama just started a re-campaign to fund his campaign exactly 10 days ago.  We also knew that the Pakistani government was very close to finding this guy.  They've had him pinned down since August.  There were rolling blackouts in the area by the Pakistani government.  It's usually the tactic and strategy you would do is like get indoors, that sort of thing.  And I think it was basically by accident and they were forced into grabbing this guy and surfacing him because the Pakistani government or China was about to surface him.  Do you think – I'm sorry, to answer your question. 
[02:14:30]  Why wouldn't they have done it?  It sounds like he was there for three years.  These people who have this power to conceal this stuff are going to allow it to be rolled out because a fucking – probably one-time Democratic president who has no – when you look at – Bush's father ran the CIA at one point.  Are you going to tell me that fucking Obama is more connected in the intelligence community than George Bush Jr.?  Absolutely, yeah.  What I'm volunteering to do is I think that this happened purely by accident. 
[02:15:00]  And the fact that I think the local government in Pakistan was about to turn this guy over.  And they knew they had to bring him out first.  Like the United States government, the only people that would have any justification of bringing this guy dead would be the U.S. government.  And I think it purely – because it wasn't a bad time.  It was after one-time TV.  Everybody's already in bed.  You don't get the same bang for the buck, the whole thing.  I think it was completely by accident that this guy surfaced.  I believe in my heart of hearts.  Anybody who says this guy was on ice for three years, that that's just ridiculous. 
[02:15:30]  But why is it –  It's a helpless one.  Who does that?  Why is it easier for you to believe that than to believe that they followed this courier for four years?  It was a tough one to get because these people were very religiously loyal to this guy.  Like I understand what you're saying.  But why is it easier for you to buy that than, you know what?  We were looking for one man who had fiercely loyal people in a God sense, not like Saddam.  Well, sorry to interrupt.  And they got him and they finally killed him.  Like why is that so hard to believe? 
[02:16:00]  I think they were trying not just to get him.  They were trying to get everybody.  The only way to make people sleep at night was to get all of his people.  But no.  They knew this compound was being built since 2005.  What, it's eight times bigger than anything else in the area?  Yeah.  There's no suspicion?  There's no suspicion of what's going on in there.  I bet you Pakistan knew.  That's Pakistan.  Pakistan absolutely fucking knew.  Pakistan knew.  Pakistan knew.  Pakistan knew.  Yeah.  Is that part of a conspiracy I believe, sir?  Gaddafi is smiling.  I believe that there were people in the fucking Pakistani intelligence community that knew. 
[02:16:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And let's go with this thing.  So they use this to Obama's advantage, let's say.  Okay.  Well, what if it comes out that Obama knew anything and this was all preplanned?  He's fucked.  Everyone.  So now you have to take that chance, too.  And you've never watched cold case files, dude?  Some of those fucking cases are 10, 20, fucking 30 years old and they find these motherfuckers  and it's like, well, what took them so long? 
[02:17:00]  Well, when you look at the backstory of how these guys were really evading the law, changing  their names, not using phones, picking up whole entirely different lives, being sheltered  by family and friends, you realize that's why it took so long.  But then eventually when they get them, you don't think, oh, did they really get fucking  John Smith, the murderer guy?  It's just because this is, you know, Osama bin Laden, that it's a big deal, but it really  is just a cold case file.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  I mean, I believe I don't think they've had him the whole time.  I do believe they've had him since August of 2010 and they've been waiting and not for  an opportunity to, like, bolster Obama.  They're waiting for an opportunity to grab all of his guys at once.  Oh, well, you know what, though?  Don't look at who they already got.  They already got Khaled Mohammed, who was number three.  Yeah.  Zala Al-Zar Qawi, we don't know where he is.  Fucking Al-Zar Qawi is dead.  The guy that took almost all of them are caught.  If you look in the paper today, all of them are caught except for the Egyptian.  And who's the other guy? 
[02:18:00]  Al-Awlaki, you know, who I think is in Yemen and we already have fucking targeted.  You see the American one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But who else are they going to get, bro?  I mean, they've already gotten most of the major players in 9-11.  Yeah, agreed.  I'm just saying, I wasn't trying to blow a hole through your comments.  I was just trying to say it's possible.  It's not outside the realm of possibility.  I don't think that's far-fetched, Roger, what you're saying.  Maybe, but most people in this country don't know who Al-Zawahari is.  Right.  But they all know bin Laden.  And that was the fuck chopping the head.  They said chopping the head off was a huge fucking get- 
[02:18:30]  But Pakistan knew.  I bet you a lot of those guys did know.  Give me a break.  By the way, if they can do DNA in a few hours, which I believe they can, why are the fucking  convicts fucking waiting for X amount of months and years to get DNA?  Priority.  But I mean, these are guys who are in jail and they don't fucking belong in jail.  Not important.  That's where tax dollars should go to fucking freeing innocent people.  I would like to know.  That drives me nuts.  They do have that foundation that that fucking-  Barry Sheck runs.  Yeah, I actually like that.  But I would like to know the statistic between how many DNA tests are done and how many actually 
[02:19:00]  come back as innocent people and how many come back as you fucking did it, asshole.  Sure.  And see if that's why they take so long.  They prioritize it.  If you're looking for a fucking rapist that's out on the loose, right, I would think that  takes priority, especially a nice immediate case that's something that just happened.  I think that would take priority over a guy that's in prison that, especially if the statistics 
[02:19:30]  prove that most of the time they aren't innocent.  But the Innocent Project, Project Innocence with Sheck, they review every case and they  only take ones where they believe that the person actually did not commit the crime.  Not in legal technicality, not in legal search and seizure shit, but where they really-  Even then, I wonder what their record is.  I saw a show on it.  I could not believe how many people were released after 18, 20 fucking years.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Be in prison and it's supposedly the freest country. 
[02:20:00]  Be in prison and you didn't do it.  We're making guys wait fucking three years for DNA tests.  It makes me sick.  It's terrible.  And that's probably more legal wrangling and prosecutors that don't want to lose their-  Scumbag prosecutors don't want to lose the stat.  Don't want to lose the stat.  Yeah.  Believe me, I've been watching The Wire, so it's kind of interesting watching how some  of the government officials and the police brass, and you watch it and just go, Jesus, you  know that shit's happening.  Oh, this is a big camera.  Yeah, I'm just a few episodes into season four. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, there's some dirty shit that goes on.  Oh, it's crazy.  No surprise, but-  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Troy, and thanks to Troy for having questions.  I am going to go into the bathroom-  And shit?  And fuck-  No, shit out my nose.  Yeah.  I am so clogged up right now, I have to fucking get rid of this.  And I can't do it in here.  Why not?  I need a mirror to make sure I don't have snot all over my face when I'm done.  Believe me, it's that fucking bad.  You don't sound clogged, though.  No, I'm really, I feel it right here.  Yeah, right in the throat.  I've been swallowing like crazy and coughing on mic. 
[02:21:00]  I gave up on the cough button.  It's like, sorry, people, you're going to hear me.  We got Guy Fieri coming in.  He's-  Okay.  His book weighs 52 pounds.  It is a large book.  It's called Food.  It's called Food.  Is it just called Food?  Iraq perked up like a dog when you blow a whistle.  Hey, Iraq, you know anything about this Guy Fieri?  Yeah, what do you know about this guy?  I liked his Food Network show.  His garlic butter saw.  Which one did he do?  Diners, drive-thrus, and dives.  Yeah, I saw a few of those. 
[02:21:30]  It was pretty good.  Yeah, I've seen this guy.  What does he do?  Like, eat shit?  He makes shit.  He wants food!  No, I don't think-  He doesn't really-  He eats more than make, right?  Yeah, something like that.  Or looks at what other people are making.  He looks at what other people makes.  And then he tries it out and says, this is delicious.  Yeah.  It's good stuff.  Good stuff.  So, what's that video they're showing down there on Fox?  Is that video through the compound?  That looks like it's exclusive.  What are they saying?  So it does cut- 
[02:22:00]  Well, I don't know what this is.  Yeah, I know.  Why don't you-  You have all that shit on the screen.  Why don't you explain what the video is, at least?  Exactly.  How about instead of the levy point in stock, you tell us what we're watching?  Oh, God.  I don't even know what-  Oh, it's green.  It's a lawn.  Yeah.  What is it?  They already-  And they even fucking cut off-  Is that part of the compound?  Exclusive.  Exclusive of what?  What are we watching?  I don't know.  Oh, it looks like-  I see a big wall.  Oh, yeah.  That's the bloody bed.  I think they got him in the bedroom or something.  There's a new video. 
[02:22:30]  He's like, rise and shine, asshole.  This is after he was already gone, though.  I just like-  I just like-  He's going for the alarm clock.  I just like knowing that I had a much nicer apartment when I was doing shitty overnights  in Buffalo than Osama Bin Laden had at the end of his life.  Did I say it again?  Yeah, no, no.  I said it, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  I said it, right?  I know.  My apartment was way better.  I was making $14,000 a year.  Poor guy.  Guy Fieri's coming in.  And maybe- 
[02:23:00]  Can we finish this round of most annoying 30 seconds?  We only have-  Oh, please.  Four left in this round.  Please.  Before we move on to the next round.  I'm tripping snot.  All right.  Go, go, go.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Yeah, this is the O.B. Anthony Show.  There you go.  I like this one.  Turn it up.  Gonna have a guy in here in a little bit.  Guy Fieri.  Guy Fieri.  Got a very heavy book. 
[02:23:30]  Did we talk about-  Don't try it out, man.  What happened in D.C.?  What happened in D.C.?  The 13th of the month, Anti-Social Network.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  It's going to be great.  Oh.  The ticket's still available.  And in Seattle, we had a bunch of them go to antisocialcomedy.com.  I have not been promoting that like I should.  Very good.  Hockey taking a back seat, but the Bruins beat the Flyers last night, 3-2.  Yeah, it's hard to compete with.  And someone almost paralyzed himself.  I forgot his fucking name.  Did you see that video? 
[02:24:00]  I can't believe now.  Guy was pretty much charging Flyers player.  I don't even have their names.  Why am I even bringing this up?  I know what you mean.  I'm going to sound really stupid.  And then he kind of misstepped and did a head array to the boards.  And I'm thinking, fucking paralyzed.  But sort of skated off the ice, and then I guess he went to the hospital.  Was it Denny Shirk?  Yes.  Holy shit.  See, I watched the hockey news.  Stupid Percy-lipped idiot on television.  Embarrassing.  God, he is a wreck. 
[02:24:30]  You're fired.  Shut up.  You're fired.  Big dumb DSLs.  Not a fan, huh?  And it's not about his politics.  They think he's an ass.  Most annoying 30 seconds.  So we're in the middle of this current round.  We got four more to look at.  And then we'll move on to the next round.  How's that sound?  Yay.  Sounds good.  All right, let's do this now.  Let's try to make this painless for the listeners.  Here's Lucas Hunton and his most annoying 30 seconds.  Lucas Hunton, what, looking for like a rabbit pelts? 
[02:25:00]  I get it.  I know.  You say things that make me insane.  Boy, then you just go.  Because you just said it was hard to believe.  Is it fun?  Is this fun?  When I say something, you go.  Because you say it was fun.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Because you say it was fun.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[02:25:30]  Ah.  James, to you.  Because we heard that one already.  Should that move on to the next round?  The next round?  Yeah.  For the most annoying 30 seconds contest.  I would say because it's hard to, uh.  I don't know if that's that annoying, though.  It's funny.  It is kind of funny, but it's also annoying, but not as annoying.  It will drive me crazy.  It's not winning annoying.  It doesn't drive me bonkers, because my language.  Yeah.  Goodbye, Lucas.  Thanks for playing. 
[02:26:00]  I'm sorry, Lucas.  Sorry, sir.  Bye.  Sorry, sir.  Adam McQuaid, for the people that care.  He was the one that did the header into the boards.  Ah.  The video's pretty fucking brutal.  Ah.  Thank you, John Conland of Concord, New Hampshire.  Uh, Mike Ford.  Most annoying 30 seconds.  Is this good enough to move on to the next round?  I'm Sam.  I'm Sam.  No, I'm Sam.  I'm Sam.  How could you be Sam if I'm Sam?  I'm Sam.  How could you be Sam if I'm Sam? 
[02:26:30]  I'm Sam.  How could you be Sam if I'm Sam?  How could you be Sam if I'm Sam if I'm Sam?  No, I'm Sam.  No, I'm Sam.  I'm Sam, and I'm from New Rock City.  That should move on.  That's pretty annoying.  It was obvious just watching Jimmy listen to that.  That moves on, Mike.  Congratulations.  The next one is Peter Thomas.  Most annoying, 30 seconds.  The truth of the matter is, they're so screened over there. 
[02:27:00]  And then they dump.  And you never hear it on the air.  It doesn't mean it's true that the pest, he doesn't talk about us because we're a fucking  bunch of no-talent wannabe sitting on desks.  See, that is really creative. 
[02:27:30]  That is really creative and annoying.  That has happened to all of us.  It's listening to satellite radio.  Because people now think that their radios were fucked up.  No.  That's what the guy decided to do.  And people are absolutely thinking that their audio is just screwed up.  Now listening back to that, that was the clip.  That's what makes it so fucking annoying.  Yeah.  Oh, look at this.  The wonder of the internet.  And now here's the guy doing...  Oh, what do you think of that guy?  He obviously moves on.  Oh, yeah.  Because that's really annoying. 
[02:28:00]  That was great.  Here's from the last night's game.  Watch this.  Misses and boom.  Damn.  And then the fucking guy falls.  The legs move a little bit.  Almost like, okay, this is the last time the legs are going to move.  Oh, wow.  And then he's just laying on the ice for a while.  But he meant to hit that guy and just fucking lost his footing and right into the boards.  Head first.  He wasn't able to get his hands up in time.  Pretty fucked up, huh?  Damn, that's got to fucking hurt.  I don't know what the update on that guy is. 
[02:28:30]  He got knocked the fuck out.  Like I said, he was able to get up and then I guess they had brought him right to the hospital.  That pussy.  Yeah.  Bruins looking fucking good in this series.  Holy shit.  You guys watching?  No.  No.  I watched scat porn.  Scat porn?  Portal and The Wire.  That's my life right now.  You enjoying The Wire?  Yes.  You are?  Love it.  Good.  Me too.  Fucking great.  It's fucking cool.  Did you see the security guard one in season four?  I don't think I'm up to that yet.  Oh, yeah, you are. 
[02:29:00]  You just started?  Yeah, yeah.  Where Marlo loses money in the card game and he's eating a lollipop and the security guard  sees him steal it?  Just.  Oh, you didn't steal it?  Okay.  Yeah.  I think I'm like two episodes in.  No, that's okay.  Believe it me.  I've heard enough about the show from the interviews and shit like that.  And you're like, fuck, I already know what happens to this guy.  Keith and Ange gave me a great birthday present.  It was a bunch of photos from the show.  From people that have been on the show and stuff like that.  Why didn't they tell me they were doing that?  I would have given them a...  I have a folder for both of you guys. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, there's...  Believe me, there's plenty of room in this thing for those pictures because I definitely  want the ones you have.  Me too, for sure.  But I'm...  I don't want mine.  I'm thumbing through it and I'm like...  Now I'm all excited.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  I took a picture of that guy.  I didn't even know.  It's Bob's audio, motherfucker.  That's cool.  And I have a photo of me, you, and Omar.  Yeah, and I'm just like...  I was out that fucking day.  I didn't know these people.  I was like fucking cool as shit.  And you have fucking Michael, the fucking... 
[02:30:00]  The young'un who didn't want to take the money for school clothes.  Tristan Wilde.  Young'un.  I was sick.  And I remember listening to you guys talk to Omar.  So fucking jealous.  The interview was great.  And I'm sitting there like, why am I not in today to get my picture with fucking Omar?  You know what?  He likes certain shows and he recognizes certain people.  Yeah, I don't know how it goes.  Anytime he gets out of bed and there's another man laying next to him, it's just like, oh,  God damn.  He's got a crank.  They showed Omar's penis recently.  Yeah, yeah.  They had Omar's dick in the fucking shot. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, it's nice.  It's nice.  It looks like he puts cocoa butter on his skin.  Giant Omar cock.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Most Anointing 30 seconds.  Did we do Peter Thomas?  I don't know.  I don't think we did.  You're on the last one, I think, right?  I don't know.  Was Peter Thomas the static one?  Yes.  It was?  Oh, I don't know.  The truth of the matter is that he did not ignore us.  The truth of the matter is.  Yeah, okay.  We did that one.  I'm sorry.  Peter Thomas, you move on.  The last one in this round is Sean Baker.  Most Annoying 30 seconds.  Oh, my God, dude. 
[02:31:00]  Was that a pickle jar?  That's very funny. 
[02:31:30]  I don't know.  It's a little too monotonous.  And Bob's audio makes me laugh too much when he gets sick.  Yeah.  Like, Bob, I would have to say no, but only because Bobby makes me laugh when he's fucking.  All right.  Well, we need to get rid of somebody.  So, Sean, let's get rid of Bob.  Unfortunately, it's you today.  Oh, Bob.  Sean Baker, thanks for playing.  So, that's it for that round.  We are now down to one, two, three, four, six.  Six people left in the contest.  $2,000 up for grabs? 
[02:32:00]  Two grand.  Or is it up for grabs?  Up for grabs.  Up for grabs from Steven Singer.  $2,000 cash, by the way.  Jeez, I hate StevenSinger.com.  Thank you.  That could be my top five moments ever.  Wait, you got a video when he recognized you?  You didn't see that?  That's huge.  I don't know if I ever saw this.  Yeah, Michael K. Williams recognizes Jimmy.  Because I win a lot of money off people asking what season of Lucky Louie it was.  I love Lucky Louie.  You got a laugh from the people. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, you know Lucky Louie?  I look, man.  I got starstruck again.  He came to the premiere of...  He doesn't realize you.  I love Lucky Louie, bro.  I didn't miss an episode.  Did you recognize him when I came in?  Milwaukee Louie?  You.  He gets up and gives him a big hug.  I'm laughing.  This is pissing me off.  You're the neighbor.  The credit for your neighbor.  That's fucking Omar.  Oh, this is pissing me off. 
[02:33:00]  This sucks.  Oh, yeah.  Rick Shapiro.  God.  Someone check.  You got me cursed, man.  Dude.  No.  You don't know how much this pisses me off.  Because I hate when he really likes an actor and they come in and know the motherfucker.  I hate it.  Lucky Louie.  Dude.  I watch that shit every time.  He made the joke to goof on him and it's backfired.  I'm thinner now.  Fuck, shut up.  That's probably why he didn't recognize me.  A man walks in and shakes.  No.  Hi, Jimmy.  What a moment. 
[02:33:30]  That's great.  That's cool as fuck.  I love you.  That's one of my favorite moments.  That was a great one.  That is cool.  Fucking Omar.  Motherfucking Omar.  Yeah.  Does that video have a dislike yet?  It looks like it might be a price from Michael K. Williams.  No dislikes?  Oh, shit.  Wait.  No.  Gregorio.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That's awesome.  It's so fucked up to see some of these guys from The Wire as, like, really nice guys.  Is he, uh, I don't think he's, I don't know if he's gay or not.  I really don't know.  Well, it's just saying he's saying. 
[02:34:00]  I don't think so.  You know who's a nice dude?  Fucking, uh, Benga, I think his name is.  He hangs at the cellar once in a while, although I've not seen him.  The guy who was Chris, uh, Parklow.  Yeah.  Who's a fucking savagely vicious guy on the show.  But so nice in person.  He's a sweet guy in real life.  I remember when we talked to him.  Sweet guy.  A lot of the guys were such, like, uh, professional, as far as acting goes, they would sit there  and talk about acting and you're like, Jesus Christ, you just come off like a motherfucking  thug.  Lance Reddick, when he was in, remember he was in K-Rock to promote? 
[02:34:30]  And, uh, then you realize how much he took his shirt off in season three.  You're like, that guy doesn't have an ounce of fat on him.  Like, it's all they're doing is showing his ass and stomach.  Which one was he?  He was, uh, uh.  The Ethiopian guy?  Daniels.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Has to be, right?  He never smiled.  It was very dark.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you know, he's all cock.  With that pudgy fucking DA woman.  Oh, you know, he's just putting, you almost, no matter how you feel about interracial fucking,  you, she's never gonna get a better fuck.  I had a fucking message from him and I lost it. 
[02:35:00]  I'm so mad.  Oh, shit.  Stay up at night.  That was a good one.  Yeah, because I broke my iPhone when I was in fucking LA because it wouldn't work.  I smashed it on the floor.  And it was on there.  It was on there.  He's fucking good, man.  Definitely.  All right.  Why don't we, uh.  More audio?  No, that's it for that round.  Oh, I thought we had more.  So we're down to six people, so.  My sweet.  I think the next time we play the most annoying clips, we've got to get a winner.  Yeah.  All right.  Is everyone allowed to judge?  We could just sit here, play them all, and then, uh, get a winner?  Each other?  Just judge each other.  That's all we do anyway. 
[02:35:30]  That's all we do every fucking day.  Enough of that shit.  I'm looking forward to the contest that we're going to have.  Which one?  The fucking, like, where we're all just doing, uh, it's about time we all got out rollers.  Settle this once and for all.  Yeah, settle it.  Settle it once and for all.  We're, how awful would that be?  Oh, it'd be terrible.  I know it'd be cold in the room.  I'd be trying to make excuses.  This is, me and Jimmy, uh, were in the bathroom the other day and, um, we're, we're, because  of circumstance, of course, I'm pissing in one of the urinals and Jimmy walks up right 
[02:36:00]  next to me in the urinal next, right next door.  And they have those little partitions and, and Jimmy grabs the partitions and shakes it  and goes, don't you hate these things?  I stole that from a comic in LA.  I have to confess.  It's fucking so funny.  That's like, and there was someone else in there.  Don't you hate these things?  No.  I love those things.  I don't.  You're from having to hide your cock from a meat peaker.  Oh, they've just, they've, they've, they've just made rest areas a place to shit and piss. 
[02:36:30]  Boo.  Atta boy.  Who's a, who's a, what's that, about an eight and a quarter, eight and a half?  I like how it's a tape measure and then a box of camel cigarettes to show scale.  What's he packing?  I don't know.  It's not an inch.  It's in centimeters, isn't it?  Well, why don't you do some fucking.  Just be a European.  21 centimeter.  Get close to that thing.  Tell us how fucking long.  21, and he's not cheating.  Because if I had the ruler, I would actually, like the, uh, the tape measure, I would actually  turn it upside down and hook the one part in my asshole and start from there. 
[02:37:00]  8.3 inches.  It was 8.3.  You would measure the root?  No, from the back.  You would go right from the root?  From, yeah, all taint and fucking dick and come around the top of the head to the back.  I wish my dick was like a fucking inch and a half bigger.  I like my dick, but an inch and a half bigger would make it mighty.  That's it.  Mighty?  Not mighty.  For me, it would be mighty because I'm a small guy.  Mighty cock.  Bigger cock.  Remember that redneck that did Sweet Home Alabama and other fucking songs on YouTube with the greasy 
[02:37:30]  hair and the glasses?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Missing teeth.  She's like a YouTube sensation for her YouTube shitty fucking song.  Sensation.  She decides she's so good and so popular on YouTube that fuck singing everyone else's songs,  I'm going to make my own song.  How'd that work out?  Well, the song's called Sunny D and Rum.  Nice.  Sunny D and Rum.  So let's take a listen to this.  You know who I'm talking about, right?  Yeah, I think so.  You know, Sam?  A visual on this? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  A visual, Sam.  Sam's a concert.  He's writing for the 10 o'clock show.  I was getting live reads ready.  He's getting, um...  Ooh, talking shit to the boss?  I guess so.  What is all of a sudden, Anthony?  Just a fucking sounding board for you to fire insults at?  That's all I am.  I love how this 10 o'clock hour has now turned into Sam getting mad when we go past 10.  Oh, excuse me.  It's my fucking show now.  I know.  Cutting into his time.  It starts at 10 o'clock.  What are you, Carol Miller?  I'm going to make you hang out in a mailroom soon.  That's very funny, by the way. 
[02:38:30]  She's still doing it, though.  She's on classic...  One of these classic fucking channels.  Yeah, she was nice.  I met her once.  She was actually really nice.  She asked how you guys were.  She was really cool.  Like I said, I have no fucking issues with her anymore.  Nah, she's cool.  That's a long, long time ago.  Sonny D and Rum.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm going to be doing an original song that I wrote.  Code Sonny D and Rum.  Yum.  Yum.  Oh, Sonny D and Rum. 
[02:39:00]  Yum, yum.  It's a flavor I just thought of.  Oh, Sonny D and Rum.  Yum, yum.  It's so good.  I can't get enough.  Oh, Sonny D and Rum.  Yum, yum.  Think I'm going to get me some more.  Five million, six million hits, huh?  Yeah, as you sit there at home going, this fucking sucks, you're in your car.  Six million views.  Six million views on that. 
[02:39:30]  For this shit.  Yeah.  Sonny D and Rum, yum, yum.  It's so good, I can't get enough.  Whoa.  Oh, Sonny D and Rum.  I think I'll run and give me some.  Whoa.  Sonny D and Rum, yum, yum.  I think I'll just drink me some.  Yum, Sonny D and Rum.  Yum, yum. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, Sonny D and Rum.  Yum, yum.  It's so good.  Six million views.  I can't get enough.  What a disgusting pig.  What the fuck, man?  What a disgusting, morbid pig.  All right, listen, we got Guy Fieri right outside the studio, so let's cut this break  short.  Go to break.  And next, we'll have Guy in studio. 
[02:40:30]  The virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at opieandanthony.com.  Opie and Anthony.  Where's Guy Fieri?  Get him the fuck in here.  We're busy.  What an intro.  Hey, Guy.  How are you, brother?  I'm good, brother. 
[02:41:00]  I like the intro, though.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a big fan, because you went from kind of just traveling around the country eating  really badly to becoming a huge star with this minute to win it.  You see this petite dancer's figure, and you think I eat badly?  I mean, this is 210 of, you know.  You dropped some pounds.  You dropped it for a bit.  No, it's that camera, man.  Is that what it is?  I ran into a guy.  The guy says, man, you're not as fat as you're on TV.  I says, Oppelman?  I said, no, the camera out's five pounds.  He's supposed to get five cameras?  Yeah.  Oh! 
[02:41:30]  Oh!  That minute to win it.  That minute to win it.  I'm hooked.  Oh, that's...  I watch.  I walk up.  I told Anthony, it's the old beat the clock.  That's what it is.  It is.  So why not call it beat the clock?  I think...  I don't know.  Someone gets money for beat the clock.  Someone, yeah.  Someone gets coin.  I want to pay someone else.  You should see...  Did you see the episode where the kids from San Jose, California, five kids, won a half million?  I walked off that, man.  And I slept for like 12 hours after that.  It was the adrenaline rush gets so high.  Right.  You know, what's going on stage and what you guys see and the way it comes off is really 
[02:42:00]  what's going down.  It's nuts.  Yeah.  And when are the new episodes?  We only shot 62 episodes last year.  Oh, that's it?  Yeah.  So we took it really easy.  Wow.  We started with eight and we kept going back in and the show had such popularity.  So we're shot up until July and then hopefully we'll jump back in and rock it again.  Oh, okay.  So they're already done in the can.  Yeah.  The Christmas ones were great.  Listen.  They were.  No.  I'm going to tell you. 
[02:42:30]  I'm embarrassed to say.  I show back up.  You know, I'd been gone for like two months.  We'd been doing Triple D and I have another show on Food Network called Guys Big Bites.  I was shooting that and I came back and said, hey, we're going to do some holiday specials.  Can we get you in two weeks?  Yeah, I'll be there.  And I show up and man, they just...  My producers blow it out though.  When did you do the Christmas episodes?  Like July?  Yeah, we did those in May.  No, actually we did them.  It was actually like three weeks before they came out.  They had to turn them pretty quick.  I always love when you have to make believe it's Christmas in the middle of summer for  some dumb TV show.  It wasn't as bad as that.  I did shoot a show one time. 
[02:43:00]  We did a Christmas special at Disney that we had to shoot a year in advance.  Wow.  At Christmas time though, because Disney only sets up.  A year in advance.  You know, my kids, my kids, my five-year-old was like, you know, four, a little bit younger.  But they changed so much in that year and then people look at them and go, do you have  another kid?  Right.  Is your kid sick?  Yes.  What do you feed him?  Look how he's grown.  Right.  You got the cookbook out, huh?  Guy Fieri.  Yeah, what's going on there?  Cooking it, loving it.  Oh, living it and then loving it. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  Love, live, love, cook.  Whatever.  The whole idea.  Well, they had to have a tagline and they wouldn't give me, that was like my ninth choice.  They wouldn't let me put exactly, I don't get to, I don't have the open airwaves like  you cats got.  So I had to put something, but it's, this is, I mean, if you're a chef and you've been  cooking all your life, you have that idea that one day I'm going to do the book.  You know, it's going to be like the mother of all books.  And we did the Diners, Drivers and Dives books.  You know, we rocked those.  We did, you know, like six, seven seasons of that.  And those books got New York Times bestsellers. 
[02:44:00]  So that was a really cool thing.  So finally I said, okay, I'm done doing that book.  I got to do my recipes this time.  Right.  So it's about 150 plus recipes and it's recipes with the stories in the background, just  all the information.  Like if we sat there and had a, you know, five hour wrap session about what do you need  to be a chef and what do you got to have in your kitchen?  Everything from equipment to, you know, when to buy mushrooms to this whole thing.  But the recipes are pretty, the recipes are pretty gangster.  Is there a salad recipe in there for Jimmy?  Because he's, he's watching this.  I'm trying to watch what I eat.  I like a well-done salmon. 
[02:44:30]  Salmon.  I'm trying to eat healthy and good.  We all try to eat healthy in this room.  You do.  I saw you shoveling down yogurt before I walked in.  Well, don't tell anyone.  No, it's good for you.  I know.  We need it.  You know what?  It's not about as much what, I mean, I think you got to watch what you eat, but it's moderation.  Yeah.  That's really the kicker.  And when people see Triple D, they'll go, oh, so you're that dude that eats all those  cheeseburgers.  Quite frankly, I'm not a big fried food guy.  I'm more like an Asian food guy.  I mean, I eat some Hong Kong noodle at 7 a.m.  But it's about moderation.  And in the book, we do, there's some steaks in here, you guys, there's some food you'd like. 
[02:45:00]  Bloody Mary flank steak, mojito chicken, sangria prawns.  Love to cook with the booze a little bit, you know.  Yeah.  That's a nice flavor.  Works as a good tenderizer.  Are you a boozer?  Not as much.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  Not as much.  Not as much.  I mean, I had my days in school, but I mean, I know John Daniels pretty well.  Yeah.  You know, he's a good cat.  So when you're eating all that horrible food, as soon as the cameras go off, you're puking,  fingers down the throat.  Again, not so much.  I take a couple, I'll take two or three bites. 
[02:45:30]  Sometimes I want to eat the whole thing, but I make my producers take it, because if  I eat it, I'll go into food coma.  And I pick the food that we do on the show.  And if you really watch it, very little bit is fried.  We try to do a lot of ethnic restaurants.  I'm into ethnic food.  I like to see what, you know, what, to kind of show this.  You know, the spice of life that we have going on in the United States.  And we've got a lot of funky joints in this country.  Yeah, we do.  You just got to get off the beaten path.  You can't go to the chain joints.  You got to go out to these little mom and pop places.  What makes a great, honestly, what makes a great show?  I can't cook for shit.  It's like, is it a feeling?  Like, how do you just know what's going to work? 
[02:46:00]  Because I literally will stand in the kitchen.  I'm just, I hate it.  What do I do now?  I can't do anything there.  Well, it's like me singing.  I mean, I love music.  I love every aspect of it.  I've got some rhythm, but I can't sing.  I mean, I think it sounds awesome until the dog howls.  You know, but I'm on stage with Sammy Hagar.  We cook together.  And, you know, he's up there.  And we're rocking out.  I think I'm doing so awesome.  And at the end of it, he pushes my mic away and grabs me around.  He goes, hey, guys, isn't it great that he can cook? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, shit.  Scorned by Hagar.  I think it is something, though, that's like an art.  You could give somebody a canvas and a brush and some paint and say, hey, paint something nice.  You have all the equipment you need.  You have the instructions in front of you.  But you're not going to be able to do something like an artist can.  And I really do think that a good chef has that in them.  Because I could look at a recipe card.  I could have the pots and pans I need, all the ingredients, add it in, and technically put in everything that needs to go in.  But it'll taste like shit. 
[02:47:00]  Well, and it's truly that.  But look at your craft.  I mean, look at how you guys do.  You take any topic.  Exactly, horribly.  No, but look at how you take any topic.  I had a small food and wine radio show out of the wine country in NorCal where I live.  And just trying to stay focused was always my difficulty.  But you guys, so everybody has their craft or has their talent.  But I will tell you this.  Cooking is so intimidating for people because they're scared of screwing up.  And I have some of the fattest Rottweilers that I just show.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't make every recipe, but it's so much. 
[02:47:30]  Here you go.  Enjoy this.  Take it away.  40-pound chihuahua.  I think what Anthony was saying, though, is we can play the notes, but we can't make the music.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy, that is exactly what I was saying.  Profound.  Thank you.  Do you know the – how do I say this?  I would have been out on that one, by the way.  I would have just said, thank you, good night.  Yeah, yeah.  What was the most unhealthy thing you ever ate when you were doing the TV show?  Me or him?  You, Jimmy?  What was her name?  Want to start with Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jimmy might enjoy – he might enjoy a trend here once in a while. 
[02:48:00]  We're not sure.  But he tells –  But at least the options – you know, he's got options.  He tells a good tale.  We're not really sure if it's real or not.  The tale?  Well, you know, I don't know.  I pick the stuff I want to eat, and then I always know that people – if I go to a restaurant  and they've got pig ear sandwich, I know that if the five of us went rolling into this joint  in Omaha and there was pig ear sandwich, one of my buddies would be eating pig ear sandwich.  I just happen to be the buddy that has a camera on him, so I eat the pig ear sandwich. 
[02:48:30]  But I'll tell you, I was at this one joint, and we were shooting, and they had sweetbreads,  which I'm not a huge fan of.  I'm not a real big fan of the parts of the animal that had a job.  If it filtered or pushed or licked or, you know, it's just –  It's a thought, yeah.  Or thought, thank you.  Or processed.  And so they had sweetbreads, which are good if – you know, but they did their sweetbreads  a little al dente, so they were still a little bit runny, kind of like runnys.  So I shovel in some of the sweetbreads.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't even know what a sweetbread is.  It's a gland. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  From what?  A sheep?  No, a steer or a calf.  Okay.  But anyway, so they serve up the sweetbread, and I guess –  I'm right in my mouth, and I'm getting a little jowl sweat, you know, when it's like  I'm not processing you so well.  So I reach up into the window of the restaurant to grab something fried to maybe like the crunch  or the salt to help wash it down.  And what I reach up and grab, fantastic.  How about a little lamb fry, a little lamb nut?  Oh, no.  Yeah, it was – it didn't go well. 
[02:49:30]  What a bad day.  Yeah, but I pulled it off.  I pulled it off.  Didn't hit the camera with it.  I can't explore food-wise.  I'm very stuck in what I like.  I can go to different restaurants.  I'd like to have a gentleman's meal, but I can't, like, try a far exotic food.  Oh, me and potatoes kind of guy.  Exactly.  Sushi.  What is a gentleman's meal?  A gentleman's meal means I am truly white trash, but I like to eat someplace that has a  fine dining experience.  But see, you're not as bad as Sam and Kenny.  We got two weirdos on this show that don't like eating. 
[02:50:00]  Sam's the worst.  Sam doesn't like steak, guy.  Ooh.  Well, you know what?  A lot of people say they don't like something, and I'll go back to the beginning of, when  did you first discover you didn't like it?  Well, it's because somebody usually cooked it really, really improperly.  All right.  Yeah.  Talk to him.  Sam was molested with a steak.  Do you want to do a conversion program?  I'll come back.  I'll bring steak.  I'll bring it in a couple different forms.  I mean, you do it the right way.  But then some people just get mental about the flesh thing, and then they're –  How much do you want to bet?  What's on the table? 
[02:50:30]  But he'll eat chicken.  I will guarantee –  So it's not like a flesh thing.  You cannot make this guy enjoy steak.  Can I have a little pre-interview before I make this decision?  I mean, I don't want to do pink slips on the Corvette or anything.  In all fairness, you're not the first to try.  Really?  He's a big wrestling fan.  So we figured Mick Foley, big wrestler, right?  He's going to feed Sam steak.  This is a dream come true for Sam.  He hated it.  How did you have the steak, Sam?  I don't know.  How did they cook it?  It was –  He doesn't even know what it tastes like.  They were here from a restaurant.  It was like good steak.  It was real good steak. 
[02:51:00]  It was very, very nice filet mignon from a very nice restaurant.  Very tasty.  It was amazing.  And what factor of you and steak do you not enjoy?  I mean, I've got a Bloody Mary flank steak in here.  Bloody Mary?  You've got to like Bloody Marys.  Oh, man.  I don't.  No.  You don't like Bloody Marys either.  Well, we're lost then.  I know.  At least it is.  He really is.  Okay, so what is it about steak you don't necessarily enjoy?  Well, I don't – I'm very specific about what foods I like, and there's more foods I don't like than foods I like, and steak happens to –  Do you like hot dogs?  No.  She likes the way they're shaped. 
[02:51:30]  Guys.  Eating them now.  Sitting on them frozen.  Yes.  I'm telling you, you met your match.  How old is your youngest kid?  Five.  That's how he eats.  Really?  Yeah, we can hang out.  How about we give you a cookie after dinner?  Fish sticks.  I would eat a cookie.  What do you like?  Chicken fingers.  Chicken fingers.  Fingers.  Not chicken.  Well, I eat any kind of chicken.  Fish sticks.  Fish sticks.  You eat any kind of chicken.  Pizza bites.  It doesn't have a bunch of sauce on it, yeah.  Not a bunch of sauce.  Right.  I don't like sauces.  What is your favorite thing?  What's your go – what's your go –  No, you don't want to know.  You go away.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken. 
[02:52:00]  Chicken fingers.  Fried chicken, yeah.  That's it.  You're a skinny dude for a fried chicken fan.  Yeah, that'll go away.  So, what is it – I mean, I just got to get the foundation of it.  What is it about – is it texture?  Well, it's just – mentally, there's something I can tell by looking at foods, whether I like  them or not.  Mentally.  Yeah, I know.  The food mentalist.  Yeah, yeah.  This is – I know.  I can predict I will not like this.  Yeah.  He's also horribly mothered.  His mother still does his laundry.  Yeah.  What happened was he was growing up and mother allowed him to get away with this instead  of slapping his horrible face. 
[02:52:30]  Mother allowed this.  Yes.  She should have forced him to eat what she wanted to eat.  We get really mad, but he's happy this way.  Have you ever had a carne asada taco?  No.  Okay, listen.  I'm not – I'm not backing down on this.  This is not – this cannot go this way.  So, you don't like hot dogs?  Do you like sausage?  No.  Yeah, he's a wreck.  Do you like beef jerky?  No.  Do you like any type of soup that has any beef flavoring?  I don't like soup.  Jeez.  I know.  Not in the traditional sense.  If you have any recipes –  If it's shot on his back, he enjoys it. 
[02:53:00]  Nice chowder.  If you have any recipes that include pizza rolls, that's the time to –  Do you like – I mean, do you like pizza with sausage on it?  No, no, no.  Just regular pizza.  Well, regular pizza does have sausage on it.  No, regular cheese pizza.  Just cheese pizza.  He would like things that are in boxes in the frozen food section that you could pop in.  Listen, I hope a lot of people don't follow suit to this.  I think we had a job out of –  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's rough.  He eats like a child.  Although, on the road with him at Comic-Con last year, he did eat what we ate in Morton's 
[02:53:30]  one night and the Palm's the next.  What did he have?  He ate the Christopher chicken.  It was fine.  It was fine.  It was a chicken.  What else do you have with the chicken?  I forget.  Bread?  Bread.  Nothing.  Mashed potatoes?  No, I don't eat mashed potatoes.  He doesn't like mashed potatoes.  I love potatoes.  But what – everybody here has got some interesting – is there a banana in that burrito?  It's not a burrito.  What is that wrapped up?  I'm looking over and I don't want to eavesdrop on your food, but that looks like a banana burrito.  This is an energy wrap.  And it's got banana, peanut butter, canola, raisins, with honey drizzled there on a whole 
[02:54:00]  way –  Where'd you get that?  Yeah, we want one of those.  That's crazy.  At Toasties.  He loves Toasties.  Toasties is so good.  He loves Toasties.  Yes, he is.  That's what he calls his socks.  What did I walk into?  I know.  A madhouse.  If you came in here when I was eating, because I only eat at about 8 o'clock – no, 7 o'clock.  I have a couple of slices of turkey on white toast with one slice of American cheese at 7 in the morning. 
[02:54:30]  This, by the way, is his hell.  This is your hell.  What is this, like an intervention?  You shouldn't – you're going to – the book of my life and these guys are – I've  got the banana burrito guy and the turkey white toast and Mr. No Hot Dog.  Eating lunch at 7 in the morning, guy.  No, but he has to hear everybody's shitty diet.  Like, people tell me jokes.  People will say, talk about this on the radio.  And this poor guy, everywhere he goes, you know what I like?  And he has to fucking feign interest.  You're this crap.  I know.  And you probably thought doing a radio show is a no-brainer, because most radio guys are really 
[02:55:00]  fucking fat.  They eat everything.  They really are awful.  Kind of easy.  We try to keep in shape here, guy.  I'm radio pretty, right?  No, you guys, this is – you bring your gloves on.  Now, do you like – I mean –  I love clams.  I'm on the clam page.  I think most of the guys in here do.  What is the clam recipe here?  That's clam with chorizo.  I think that's the one with chorizo.  Nice.  You take Spanish and Mexican chorizo.  Clams have such great flavor, such a predominant flavor, but they can share the plate.  You put a little chorizo in there and you get some of that spice, a little bit of the fat  coming through it.  Put it on pasta, or sometimes I'll take them right out and put it on a little crostini, 
[02:55:30]  like in that recipe there.  Vinegar?  Huh?  A little vinegar?  Come on.  All right.  Bring it.  Do you think you taught that stuff, like you know to put that on there, or is that something  that you're like, you know what, I just know that that stuff would go well, like pasta  and that would just go well together.  You need a balance of salt and sugar and acid and spice in everything.  I mean, there really needs to be, even in cereals, you know, you like a cereal and you  like the sweet side of the cereal, you also like that little salty side.  It's that contrast that really creates so much. 
[02:56:00]  And that's what happens so often, is you'll see, you taste something, and then you'll just  kind of find out, is it lacking in the contrast?  Acid's usually the one that they're lacking in.  But in the book, like this sangria-glazed shrimp, so we do a reduction of wine.  We do a, it has a little bit of honey, it has a little bit of sugar, and then you put  in a little bit of sherry, you know, a little dry sherry.  So you get a little, you know, but you take this and you drizzle, you drizzle it.  I like them scrimps.  I like them scrimps, y'all.  You whine.  See, I got to tell you, though, it is hard to show up with a book and no food. 
[02:56:30]  I think this is wrong.  I know.  I have to talk to somebody.  I'm just, I'm looking at this going like, ah, God.  This is a scratch and sniff page, though.  See, I think what happened, you became a big star with the Minute to Win,  so now you don't have to cook anymore.  No, no, no, no.  So now you just bring the book.  I bet you a couple years ago, you would have had some fucking burners in here.  Chef first and foremost, and still sticking to that.  When I retire, it'll be a little restaurant on the beach, Mexico.  Oh, man.  You know, open the door when I want, you know, serve when I want. 
[02:57:00]  Nice.  This is what I do.  I mean, I own five restaurants in the wine country, and some crazy joints, though.  One's called Johnny Garlic's, which is kind of like California Italian,  so it's, you know, fresh made everything.  But we just, we do a lot of fusion, like tequila, turkey, fettuccine, Alfredo.  I think you'd like that one.  Holy shit.  You like tequila?  Any of this sound good?  No, I don't drink.  Jesus.  I know.  What do you?  Do the clams sound good?  Nothing.  I don't eat fish, seafood.  No seafood.  I don't eat that stuff.  He literally eats five things.  Exactly.  There's no way I would eat clams.  His mother should have backhanded him.  Have you ever had a clam?  No. 
[02:57:30]  Say it.  Wow.  I mean, how do you know you don't like it then?  I know.  It's mind-boggling.  Hey, why don't you eat a clam?  Yeah.  It's like a towel.  Get down there.  I can't sit down there and eat that clam.  You guys can order up.  That's not the right thing.  I'm going to give you the book.  Next time we do this, I'm going to let you order up your top three.  We'll come back.  We'll make them.  Would you really come back and cook?  That would rock.  No, I'm not joking.  Had I known that this was going to-  Be a weird show?  No.  Absolutely.  One, I want to go into some training.  I want to get 20 of my fraternity brothers and have them sit there and rant at me and see if 
[02:58:00]  I can hang for half an hour.  By the way, I'm a restaurant owner guy.  I heard.  Yeah.  In Huntington.  Yeah.  What?  Yes.  Who gave you that?  No, I was talking about-  F.H. Riley's.  My brother actually is an amazing chef.  He really is.  I'm just a fucking silent partner.  I just fucking-  Pull the residge, baby.  I just gave him some money.  Yeah.  And he did the rest.  But you look good going in.  Yeah, that's it.  I don't know shit about this.  But you like to eat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that's one of the-  No, it is with me.  I like tasty, healthy. 
[02:58:30]  That's it.  Is that bad?  It's not bad at all.  I don't like suffering, so I don't eat just a fucking dry salad, so I try to find stuff  that is healthy, but tasty.  Not easy.  But you're getting a better experience now in food than probably you've seen in the last  50 years.  Organics are becoming affordable, organic.  So when you eat an heirloom tomato versus a regular old 5x5 tomato that was ripened  in a hothouse or ripened in a warehouse with gases, you get these experiences now in food  that are just mind-blowing and hormone-free beef and heirloom pork and all these different 
[02:59:00]  things that are coming about.  So you're in the right zone, and it's not- people think, oh, healthy, okay, I've got  to have the banana-marino.  I would rather-  It's not-  Shitty, then.  No.  But it's out there, and you've just got to find the joints that are doing it.  And books like this, I don't try to make my stuff complicated.  I don't want a bunch of stuff added into it.  Right.  Quick and simple, baby.  You want to meet the opposite of Sam?  The guy taking the pictures?  Yes.  He will eat anything.  He'll eat clams and that camera.  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  He is the complete opposite.  He has never turned down a- well, he's turned down salads, I'm sure, but he doesn't  turn down a meal ever.  You know, when we were talking about what you eat and how much you eat and the size  of people, if- I was an exchange student in France, and we ate everything, even at school  lunches, we ate it in courses.  And you eat a little bit, and then you wait, and they're going to serve another course,  and you're like, come on, where's the food?  But you'll eat less, you'll enjoy it more, because you've got to savor those like six  or seven bites you got of this risotto or whatever it is in front of you, and then you  wait, and then you have a little conversation, and your body, your stomach catches, your 
[03:00:00]  head catches up with your stomach, because it's when you eat so fast.  I mean, look at this, how we go.  You go to some buffet, and you load up all this food.  By the time you consume it all, your mind hasn't even caught up yet that you're full.  And then all of a sudden, then you're going to over-full.  Oh, my God, I'm, yeah.  Yes.  We all know that, but we don't stop until we get the message.  My mind says eat until you're physically shitting.  You want to talk to-  What is a dinner table look like?  It's not good, guys.  It's a porta potty. 
[03:00:30]  That's not good, man.  He likes to tell another tale.  We don't know if it's true.  What?  About logs hitting chests and stuff.  No, no.  We don't really know.  E-Rock, though.  Guy, why don't you talk to E-Rock?  Because he's, a guy who's like two minutes-  This guy loves his fucking food.  What's your hand-down favorite?  Steak.  There you go.  Raw?  I mean, we eat it right off the hoof.  Flaming yon in the bone.  With the bone.  You like a little bone in there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I think that any time you can have the meat connected to a bone or associated with it, 
[03:01:00]  chicken in particular.  If you ever have a chance to have chicken with the bone versus just the chicken tender or pounded out chicken breast,  huge difference.  The greatest thing E-Rock ever ate was the steak martini.  All right.  What was in the steak martini?  It was in a big martini glass.  It was mashed potatoes with cut up filet mignon with gravy.  That's great.  Combine a heart attack with a DUI.  Now, Roland.  Yeah, Roland.  Roland also likes his food.  I am a vegetarian. 
[03:01:30]  I kid.  Roland, you want to play a little game with Roland?  Please.  Name a particular food.  He'll tell you the best place to get it in New York.  He should be on your show.  Really?  He should have his own iPhone app.  You can name donuts, fucking burgers, anything.  What do you got?  Give me the...  Actually, we just had this debate on the way over here.  Let's talk about pastrami.  Best pastrami.  Oh, I have to say that the fontes, though, they roast your own pastrami. 
[03:02:00]  Like, lay at night in the morning.  If you go out in the morning, they slice it.  It's so delicious.  He knows.  What is it?  And I thought you picked a weird one.  We're calling movie phone.  I know.  Welcome to foodie phone.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Guy has a hard out.  You have to go?  No, I don't go.  Don't listen to anybody.  They don't know what they said.  Just let them go.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  I brought a cooler, a beer.  Are you playing your side of the game?  Like, ah, don't listen to them, but you really have to go?  No, I do have a...  So we're launching the book. 
[03:02:30]  The book just came out today.  Yes.  Yeah.  And then the idea behind the book is we're visiting New York here for a bit.  Then we're off to the Derby.  You guys been to the Derby?  I'm going to be going this week.  Are you?  Oh, brother.  It's out of bounds.  So we're hitting the Derby, and then we're home for a couple days.  And I'm doing a road show across the country, starting in South Carolina, ended up in Arizona.  And it's a food rock and roll show.  So we have a bunch of music, a bunch of food, cooking, hanging out.  I have a 25-gallon blender that's six feet high.  Jeez.  I make cocktails with it.  That should be in the studio. 
[03:03:00]  That's crazy.  I couldn't get to Fort Knox downstairs, though.  That's awesome.  Are you doing signings?  Are you doing signings for this?  Yeah, we're doing signings in New Jersey tonight and tomorrow.  I'm going to guess Ridgewood bookends in New Jersey is at it.  And where tomorrow?  Barnes & Noble.  We're here.  Pet Station, Columbus.  So much signing now.  I know.  They're signing through the glass.  It's amazing.  I think they said Penn Station, Barnes & Noble.  No, that's at Borders.  Oh, it is Borders.  Yeah.  Barnes & Noble.  Carl Place.  Carl Place.  Carl Place.  Long Island.  Oh, okay.  Are you doing book review?  Everybody's in here now.  I know.  It is amazing how the food, the whole cook and chefs and the food channel, everything has 
[03:03:30]  really taken off.  In years past, no one really, I mean, Housewives would sit and watch Julia Child or something,  but for the most part, now it's like a lot more, if you could even call that like action,  there's a lot more interest that people have.  It's such a crazy thing.  I mean, I've been cooking since I was a kid.  All I wanted to be was a chef, be a dad.  That was my whole gig.  So I'm doing this.  I got my restaurants in the wine country. 
[03:04:00]  One of them is called Tex Wasabi's, which is Southern Barbecue and Sushi.  Oh, man.  Well, here's the thing.  You go and have sushi, you know, you kind of feel like, wow, that was great flavor, but  I'm not quite there yet.  Now.  Now you step over to some ribs, but so I was doing these restaurants and my buddies heard  about this contest on Food Network called Next Food Network Star and they dared me to  do it just so I could look like an idiot.  I swear they didn't care if I won or not.  They just like, no, no, no, no.  My buddy Cletus, come on, you can do it.  So I do the show.  I win the show.  I get a cooking show.  I thought, oh, that's cool.  You know, I'll do this a couple of times, but why would they need me?  They got Emeril and Bobby and Mario and all these cats and they just didn't have anybody 
[03:04:30]  with tattoos yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there's attitude, but so it just blows up.  Then we do Triple D and things have been nuts, but I'm still a chef.  I'm still a restaurant owner and I'm still a dad.  Someone was telling me to ask you about a Lamborghini.  Oh, did you hear that?  Jacked.  Complete.  No, I wasn't in it.  So we're in Chicago shooting Triple D.  I'm sitting there.  We're filming.  Phone's blowing up in my pockets.  Finally, I'm like, everybody knows not the car.  I look at the dealerships.  Call us immediately.  And I'm thinking like, because it was in for service. 
[03:05:00]  I've only had it for a year, but it had to get its like thousand mile service.  Oh, damn.  And the English guy comes on.  It's an English motor company.  Your car was stolen.  And I look at my film crew and I go, if anybody's, you know, if I'm getting punked right now,  someone's going to get a smack.  You don't joke about a man's Lamborghini.  That was like my big trophy of my career.  Someone broke in through the skylight, rappelled down, dressed as a ninja.  No, seriously.  I got the video.  I got the video.  I called down on you.  Dressed as a ninja. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, with the tools hanging from the belt, peruses the dealership for 28 minutes and  then steals my yellow Gallardo spider.  Decides your...  Magnets on the door, rolls it out, drives away, and they didn't know.  Did you steal your own car?  Listen, I'm telling you something.  It would have been made for a TV movie.  So the car's gone, and it was a real bummer.  Have you gotten it back?  No, it's 86.  It's gone.  They have a shot of it at like 4.50 in the morning, driving across San Francisco, the Golden  Gate Bridge, and that was it.  Maybe Pacino is driving it blind behind something. 
[03:06:00]  Jacked my leg.  Have the dealership.  Amazing.  Welcome to America.  You got to go.  Yeah.  Now they're making a stink.  Hey, so, and I'm serious, and thank you guys.  Big fan.  You're hysterical, Katz.  I think that it's so great that you're ready to just say whatever you can say now.  That's the whole transition.  I have this in all my cars, so I think people that don't have satellite are missing it.  But thanks for having me, and I'll tell you, the offer to come back and cook, I mean, I 
[03:06:30]  will destroy the studio.  That would be great.  Yeah, his great decision.  And I will bring people that will love it.  He will shove steak in his house.  Oh, yeah.  The book is called Guy Fieri Food.  Yeah.  And am I missing it up there or no?  No, Guy Fieri Food.  Cook it.  Love it.  It's big enough.  It's only like three and a half pounds, and it can work as a boat anchor, a small weapon  on the subway.  It's a heavy book.  I'm glad you're acknowledging that.  It's good.  You feel like you're getting something.  And the cool thing about it was it's 30 years, man. 
[03:07:00]  It's everything from when I was a little kid to what I do now in my restaurants and  on my shows.  And so I figured if I'm going to get one shot to do my own book, I better make it a big  one.  So tonight it bookends in Ridgewood, and then tomorrow, Carl Place, Barnes & Noble, both  great places for assignment.  Oh, man.  All right.  We got to take a break?  Thank you.  Yeah, I guess you guys are awesome.  Thanks.  Thank you, Guy.  Thank you, Guy. </pre>
