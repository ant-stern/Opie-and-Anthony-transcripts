<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in crude sexual banter before briefly commenting on a Miami Heat game and LeBron James’s headband-less appearance.  They then promoted their podcast, highlighting an interview with Scott Thorson (Liberace's ex-lover), a repeat of their "8-track porn" bit, and the "Opie and Anthony Nugget."  A substantial portion of the show focused on a heated debate about the American Medical Association's classification of obesity as a disease. Callers shared personal struggles with weight and food addiction, with graphic details of the physical challenges of extreme obesity.  One caller, a personal trainer, detailed clients' compulsive eating, another, "Borgata Ray," linked gambling and food addiction. A doctor, Dr. J, called in to strongly disagree with obesity being classified as a disease, emphasizing personal responsibility.  The discussion also touched upon the business of addiction treatment and self-destructive behaviors.  The hosts briefly expressed skepticism and anger over a proposed bill restricting racial descriptions in crime reports.  They again promoted their podcast, mentioning an upcoming appearance by the Cronut King.

The show continued with another podcast promotion, announcing Elijah Wood and Ricky Gervais as the next day's guests.  This was followed by a comedic imitation of Ricky Gervais’s David Brent character, including a mock "Learn Guitar with David Brent" segment featuring a song about selling cleaning supplies.  The hosts then discussed Russell Brand's contentious MSNBC *Morning Joe* interview, repeatedly using vulgar language to refer to Mika Brzezinski.  A clip from the interview was mentioned, and Russell Brand, along with publicists Caddy Kay and Brian Shackman, joined the show. They discussed Brand's upcoming tour, "The Messiah Complex," and further dissected the *Morning Joe* interview, criticizing Brzezinski’s performance.

A significant portion of the show then focused on freedom of speech and the consequences of expressing controversial opinions.  The hosts used vulgar language throughout this discussion, citing the example of radio personality Cowhead, who survived controversy unlike others fired for similar offenses.  They discussed public displays of dissent like flag burning, their dislike for the Westboro Baptist Church, and a veteran caller’s perspective on the flag's symbolic meaning.  Tangents included a caller's anecdote about Stephen King’s *Salem’s Lot*,  the hosts' personal experiences with on-air controversies, and recollections of past on-air bits.  They mentioned Al Sharpton, Russell Brand, and Adam Sandler, shared anecdotes from their personal lives (dental work and parenting), and concluded with a podcast plug and a smoothie anecdote.

The show next segued into a discussion about toothpaste, Opie's damaged tooth, and his use of his child's Toy Story toothpaste.  They then discussed ONA Photos, a Twitter account featuring old photos from the show.  They discussed a beauty pageant contestant’s nonsensical answer about gender pay inequality, her subsequent late-night talk show appearances (Kimmel and Fallon), and Donald Trump's reaction.  They detailed various outrageous stunts and incidents, including graphic descriptions of sexual acts on and around the set, the "55-gallon drum challenge," a Bruce Springsteen music collection destruction, a rat-eating contest,  "Lesbian for a Day" events, a sexually charged ice cream social, and a woman with bad breast implants.  They mentioned a guest appearance by Brian Regan and recounted incidents involving "Wheelchair Fred" and a clip of his phone call detailing a dildo-in-bathtub incident.  The discussion also covered Miss Utah’s disastrous pageant answer (shown and discussed at length), a viral bear video, and a questionable snake-opening-a-door video.  They concluded by agreeing to revive the "ice cream social" and further discussed past stunts.

The final segment opened with a critique of a Discovery Channel live tightrope walk across the Grand Canyon, criticizing the use of a safety wire.  This transitioned into a discussion about Fox News being sued by the family of a man who committed suicide on air, with the hosts expressing extreme negativity towards the family.  Jimmy Norton’s advice show followed, featuring numerous callers with varied issues, including:  Lil Wayne being dropped by sponsors (Truth in Chicago); sugar addiction's role in alcoholism and food addiction (Sonny from Boston); navigating a relationship with a Russian escort (David); sleeping with a cousin (Pete in Brooklyn, call cut short); overcoming loneliness (Jay in North Carolina); dealing with escorts and a sexless marriage (Floyd/John in Virginia); a mistress and wife's new job (Tim in Buffalo); a failing sex life and Asperger's (Andy in Baltimore); quitting drinking (Rob in Mississippi, Norton's personal story); insomnia (David, New Jersey); a stagnant sex life and desire for threesomes (Kim in Atlanta); and infidelity (Beverly in San Francisco).  Chrissy (Indiana) discussed the societal stigma around obesity and whether airlines should accommodate overweight passengers, leading to a heated debate about personal responsibility versus societal accommodation.  The show ended with further discussion of this debate, with the hosts reiterating their position and expressing irritation with the caller while acknowledging her weight loss.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  What's up?  How did I see?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're trying to find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down, Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony, I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies. 
[00:01:00]  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  If I pull your mic down.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I was right already.  What other show, you know, starts with, oh, God.  It is microphone, arm sounds.  We had a good show yesterday, man.  What the fuck?  I know. 
[00:02:00]  I gotta do it again or something.  Give us a day to go, wow, that was a nice show.  Reflect.  Yeah.  Right.  Heat.  We should be able to reflect.  Heh heh.  Bitchy.  I heard I missed a good basketball game.  Ah, I didn't watch it either, but Twitter was alight with the results of the game, I guess.  The Heat won, and they probably shouldn't have, right?  Is that the gist?  I crashed at halftime.  I mean, these hours.  And I wanted to, I actually wanted to stay up and watch this game last night. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  By halftime, my eyes were like, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr,  just the heavy eyelids.  I'm like, fuck it.  I'll find out in the morning.  I guess the Heat had a nice little comeback.  Yeah, apparently so.  And then LeBron James is playing without a headband, and that was a big deal, and I don't  fucking know.  So now we got game seven, the Spurs.  Come on, you should have won that fucking game.  Well, at least that's it.  Huh?  At least that's it after that.  I guess.  One more game.  Game seven in Miami, that's going to be rough for the Spurs. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  There's basketball talk.  That's the basketball break right there.  I heard it was a great game, though.  Put that in a nice little nutshell, didn't we?  Mm-hmm.  That should be the nugget for next week.  Podcast is up, and people are already tweeting about it.  So you got the Scott Thorson interview, Liberace's ex-lover.  Lover.  And we finally determined that there were a lot of lies in that interview.  We think he was full of shit in a lot of instances during that, but what the fuck? 
[00:03:30]  It was entertaining.  I guess Howard interviewed him yesterday, and people were telling me that he was saying  completely different things on his show.  Opposite things of...  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was entertaining as all hell, so we threw it on the podcast this week.  That's all it needs to be, right?  And then we went old school and did 8-track porn, a bit we did probably six years ago,  six, seven years ago.  And then, of course, the Opie and Anthony Nugget.  So go to iTunes and get the Opie and Anthony podcast. 
[00:04:00]  The link is on our Facebook page, right, E-Rock?  I believe so.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook and, I don't know, all the other places you can get podcasts,  right?  Right-io.  They're trying to say obesity is a disease now?  I'm a little confused by this one.  Why'd you go to that right after you?  Well, the E-Rock.  I spoke to E-Rock.  That's not even...  E-Rock, do you think you have a disease?  Oh, boy.  No.  Asperger.  Huh?  No. 
[00:04:30]  Roland was trying to be funny.  What was he just saying?  I think...  Asperger's.  Roland is just...  Blurts out the name of something.  Asperger's.  Asperger's.  Asperger's.  Yeah, I guess they decided the American Medical Association,  some bunch of doctors hanging out at some fucking convention, and they decide,  obesity is a disease.  Classified as a disease, officially.  Yeah, but we were just talking about it right before the show, and how do you determine 
[00:05:00]  if it's a disease or if it's someone that just doesn't feel like fucking taking care  of themselves?  Because I think there's a line there.  Yeah.  I believe there are people out there that cannot, if they did everything, you know,  get...  Look, like that big bitch on CNN.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck, she's got a disease.  Giant woman.  There's no way she could be a small woman, right?  No.  But then there's others that just choose not to live a healthy lifestyle.  So is that a disease, too?  Because they choose not to eat salad?  Yeah.  Or eat properly?  It's a very weird classification. 
[00:05:30]  Because...  Like, how are they going to decide that?  How are they going to determine that?  I don't know what...  They said alcoholism was many years ago, and the drug addiction.  I don't know what classifies them, like what they say makes the disease.  Right.  Maybe the physical thing that happens.  I think it's a symptom of...  It could be a symptom of a disease, like if you have a thyroid problem, shit like that.  Right.  Digestive problem, whatever the fuck.  Metabolism.  And then you get big.  That's like an issue. 
[00:06:00]  But if you're just, you know, some guy that loves going to the fridge constantly and pulling  out goodies, you know, how are you going to say that's a disease?  I'm trying to eat even better, and I was struggling last night.  I was literally...  Do you go to the gym?  I go to the gym.  Are you eating back there?  That's it.  And I was trying to eat, like...  I was trying to eat perfect yesterday.  Yeah.  But then it was time for sugar.  Oh, it was time for a little...  Some goodies.  And I was able to push that fucking craving down yesterday, but I'm not going to win today. 
[00:06:30]  Snicky snacks.  But it's hard, is what my point is.  I've been eating pretzels lately, like I shouldn't, and I said, what am I doing?  I fucking went and got carrots.  I don't want carrots.  I want pretzels, but I can't eat them.  Pretzels.  You got to tell yourself no.  And it's not easy.  I was fucking a pretzel bandit last night.  Love a good pretzel.  I was shoving pretzels in my fucking mall last night.  To the point where it feels like you got a softball in your throat.  You're like, I think I need to take a sip of my drink now. 
[00:07:00]  Oh my God.  To wash down this big pretzel ball in my fucking esophagus.  Are you all bloated from all the salt?  This is terrible.  We're a bunch of girls.  A bunch of young ladies.  We really are a bunch of girls.  My nickname is Pretzel Boy.  Oh yes, of course.  Every other radio guy shoves donuts down their faces and don't give a fuck and don't ever talk.  What do you think about it?  Terrible.  Of course, we got people already calling about the obesity thing.  Lawrence, Texas.  Lawrence.  What's up, guys? 
[00:07:30]  What's up?  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you a royalty?  Yes.  All right.  Very good.  Nice.  Yeah.  I don't think obesity should be a fucking disease.  Um, but, uh, uh, like if you overeat, like say your diet is heavy in McDonald's, like  you could get addicted to food, like just the sugars and shit, but I don't think obesity  itself should be a disease.  It is more than, in all honesty, as much as I get annoyed sitting next to a fat guy on a 
[00:08:00]  plane, it is more than just quit eating fatso.  It's an addiction, I gather.  Like there is more to it than for, for some.  Yeah.  So how do you determine that?  Like is Governor Christie a guy that has a disease or he can't eat properly?  Like what is...  Because I've seen the old pictures of the guy.  Mm-hmm.  He had, he had a, you know, a normal frame for, for a while there.  But wouldn't food addiction be the disease and obesity be the symptom of food addiction?  I think it's just the symptom, right?  That's what I'm, that's what we're trying to figure out today. 
[00:08:30]  That's probably what they're saying.  The addiction, because the addiction part I get, that's probably what they're saying  is that the obesity is right, is what happens.  No, they're saying it's disease.  The obesity part is the disease.  It's weird.  But why is the, the addiction part, you know, tells your brain that you got to butter your  steak before you throw it in the fucking, throw it on the grill.  Like, that's what I'm trying to say.  Well, it depends on the ingredients, man.  And like caffeine or sugar, those are addictive properties.  Yeah, I'm like, you have a butter in the steak. 
[00:09:00]  That's, but, but seriously.  It's a disease called deliciousitis, that's what it is.  Holy fuck, that's good.  Or I'm going to eat a salad, but I'm going to fucking drown it in, you know, dressing.  That's more calories than the actual fucking salad.  I love a good dressing.  Where's the line?  I think it's.  Or you just got a weak will.  I think it's also that this, whatever that does for you mentally, like whatever, like,  you know when you eat like fucking cheesecake, that fucking, ugh.  It's the chasing of that feeling.  Because that's all it is, is that feeling that it gives you.  And then immediately after you swallow, you start crying and you take a rape shower. 
[00:09:30]  I can't believe I ate the cheesecake.  Why do I do this?  And then there's the other side where I can't enjoy anything, right?  Why can't our brains calm the fuck down?  Like, I see the shit that comes in here and I go, ah, I could do it.  And I eat it.  And then immediately I'm like, what did I do that?  Why?  All I had to do was go, ah, you know, get this out of the fucking studio.  Yeah.  All right.  That's a great phone call there, Lawrence. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  You really got us going today.  Thank you.  He had me worried.  He had me worried at the beginning of that one.  Yes, yes.  He finally got his thoughts together.  Personal trainer who deals with obese clients.  What?  I'm not saying it's not a disease.  My whole point is, like, where's the line where, you know, you got to kind of do the  right thing?  Yeah.  I don't think you can lump them all into one thing.  I think even with addictions, there's the, I think it's like being gay.  You know, there are people that are gay and they're born like that.  You know, you can see when they're fucking two years old, it's like, whoa. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  Gay.  And then there's other people that I think are attracted to the lifestyle and become  gay.  They're like, ah, I want to be gay.  And I think addiction is the same thing.  I think there are people that have some kind of a fucked up thing in their head that makes  them do something.  And then there are people that just enjoy doing something so much.  Right.  That they just do it.  Right.  So I don't think you could lump everyone in one little category there, you know?  Yeah.  I agree.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, um, yeah, I, cause I, I believe the alcoholism and, and again, a lot of people 
[00:11:00]  question that wise, but they classified that many years ago.  And, uh, yeah, I don't know exactly, even with alcoholism, what the medical profession  says is.  That it's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's classified.  Yeah.  It's considered a fun.  Um, but Dr.  Steve would probably know much better than I, we would.  Yeah.  We should ask him.  Yeah.  Pour fluid down your mouth.  Yeah.  It's such a disease.  I need a cheesecake or something. 
[00:11:30]  It's an aspirin.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Stupid touch.  Yeah.  Obesity.  O-C-O-D and O-E-s-a-d.  Yeah.  Justin in Florida.  Help me out here, brother.  Justin.  How come he's not just out?  What's up, Justin?  Yeah.  Hey guys.  Uh, you know, I agree with what you're saying.  That it's an individual thing.  You know, I work with a lot of obese clients as a personal trainer and health coach.  And the average person you see just walking around and needs to lose 30 or 40 pounds, 
[00:12:00]  they're considering them to be obese.  But I don't think that that, per se, is the addictive side.  I'm talking about the people that you see that are 300, 400 pounds.  Whoa.  Uh, I got clients that tell me, like, they're, they, they're driving by a drive-thru.  They know they shouldn't go there, but they can't help themselves.  They pull in.  They, uh, are sitting there.  The whole time after they order, they're like, should I just drive away? 
[00:12:30]  I don't want to do it.  But they can't pull themselves the other way.  They eat the food.  And then after they eat the food, they feel so bad about it that they medicate themselves  with more food until the point where you can actually even throw up blood because you're  eating so much and you're at serious health risk.  Amazing.  That sounds terrible.  For me, I, I just, uh, over the years, I just try to keep the shit out of the house.  But now with the young kids, it makes it tougher.  But I know if I'm in a car that, that tick to eat sugar or something like that's not that 
[00:13:00]  healthy.  Yeah.  I'm not, I can drive by, you know, the fast food joints and all that.  There's a lot of steps you have to go through when you're on the road to actually get the  shit into your mouth.  Yeah.  I didn't even realize that that goes on with people.  When they can't, they're driving, they see the fucking drive through and they're shaking  like, oh fuck.  When you're home, if it's sitting right there out there on the counter, it's very easy  to just shove it in your face and go, oh fuck, what am I doing?  Right.  I feel like I'm not going to eat bad if I'm in a car. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Huh?  You could, you know, you could go into a room with people and every person in that room has  a problem.  Some people are gamblers.  Some people are alcoholics.  Some of them cheat on their life.  It could be one guy.  His name is the life of the party.  Obesity is the one thing that they have to wear like a scarlet ladder.  You can never hide it.  Everybody knows about it.  And the people that are super obese, the people that are really heavy, they're very sensitive  and very insecure that they're being judged every day. 
[00:14:00]  And that just fuels the problem even more.  It really is.  I'll say this too.  I've gotten a little, like I've judged them very harshly and it probably shouldn't have  because, you know, I know it's a hard one.  And like when they bring donuts and stuff in here for us or food, like literally there's  times where I want to have one, but I'm like, if I have one, I won't be able to stop.  Like I know, I'm afraid I'm going to binge.  Like normal people can have a donut or go like, oh, you know what?  Maybe I'll have a half a donut.  But like, I'm afraid if I have a half a donut, I'm going to fucking binge all day. 
[00:14:30]  It's like, it's, yeah.  Maybe that's, yeah.  But you're able to push that, you're able to push that urge down.  Yeah.  But that fear is, I don't know if that's really normal to have that fear of I'm going to binge.  A lot of these really obese people that you see, they, if you talk to them, they've had  some sort of tragedy in their life.  Tragedy.  They've had some kind of like major thing that's happened that made them turn to food  and they just chose food instead of like alcohol.  Yeah.  It's a tough one, man.  Can we, can we, can we acknowledge that we've all had tragedies? 
[00:15:00]  Right?  I mean, stop already.  I think every single person, if you're living a life and you make it a bunch of years, you  could, you could point back to tragedy.  Nothing worse than watching those hoarder shows and hearing, well, it was back when I was  eight.  My father and mother split up.  Oh yeah.  So you have to fucking shit on your own stairs.  Perfect.  Perfect. 
[00:15:30]  Exactly.  Everyone's had some tragedy.  They had tragedy in their life excuse.  I think, I think just living, that's part of living.  You have tragedy.  Jesus Christ.  You really do.  And it does affect you, sure.  But to use it as an excuse.  Yeah, suck it up.  It's always an excuse.  Fuck.  Yeah.  We all handle it differently.  Some of us handle it okay.  And some of us barricade ourselves with weapons and don't cry since 1995.  I'm not saying there's not, there's not problems because of the tragedy. 
[00:16:00]  But I guess my point is there's people that think they're the only ones that had tragedy  in their life.  I think, I think the majority of people listening to our voices right now had tragedy in their  lives.  Actually, anyone who's feels compelled to listen to our voices.  Especially this crowd.  It's tragedy as they're listening.  Exactly.  They're getting it right now.  My favorite one was the Snapple Lady.  She was on that Celebrity Fit Club.  I can't get enough of what she said.  She used to be, thanks brother.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:16:30]  She used to be a pretty normal sized girl, whatever.  And then her parents brought home another kid.  They decided to have another kid.  Right.  And that's what sent her down the road of overeating.  I was always the number one child.  And then my parents had another child and I wasn't number one anymore.  Yuck.  What?  Wow.  That's, that's reaching for an excuse.  That really is.  If you can find the clip, it makes me laugh every time.  That really is.  It might be a tough one to find.  Yeah.  It's the Snapple Lady. 
[00:17:00]  We got a doctor's opinion.  I'm starting to believe there, certainly there is a disease thing here, but my, our point,  or my point certainly is where is the fucking line where you can take care of yourself and  you know it's not a disease and it's, or you're, you fall into the disease category.  I always think like, like you get somebody with, with cancer going like, oh, you know,  I should really lay off the cancer today.  And then it goes away because you're not fucking going to the store and buying more cancer. 
[00:17:30]  Like that, that to me is a fucking disease and, and it should piss them off to no end  when people are sitting there shoving food in their face and then that's classified as  disease.  Go fuck yourself.  Well, technically that would be equal, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're both diseases.  Oh boy.  Oh, I really need to stop going to Sam's Club and picking up those cases of heart disease.  Let's go to Dr. J.  Ooh.  Yo, good morning.  Hello.  What's up, Mr. Irving? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  How's it going?  Listen, newsflash, obesity is not a fucking disease.  All right.  And you're.  And I'm a doctor.  Yeah.  Here's the deal.  A disease is defined by a set of signs and symptoms.  For example, if you've got hypertension, high blood pressure, you've got small vessel  changes in the eyes and the kidneys and the numbers are high on the blood pressure cuff.  Obesity is not a fucking disease.  Obesity is people that can't control themselves now. 
[00:18:30]  Obesity can lead to type 2 diabetes, which is a disease.  You've got a bunch of guys in Washington that sit around in their bow ties and they come  up with opinions and they don't practice and they don't know what the fuck they're talking  about.  All right.  Patient of Islam.  Obesity overeating is just like drugs and alcohol.  It's not a fucking disease.  It's called taking control of your life.  Okay.  So you don't, you don't, you're from the school of thought that none of those things  are a disease.  That what?  You're, you're kind of from the school of thought that none of those things are a disease. 
[00:19:00]  I do not believe they're a disease at all.  No, I think they're a sign of something else.  Okay.  What do you think they're a sign of?  I beg your pardon?  What do you think they're a sign of?  I think it's a sign of, for example, someone who drinks too much or uses drugs too much.  That's simply a matter of they've got problems in the past that they haven't dealt with adequately  or they have problems in the present and they're using the substance as a crutch to  deal with their issues.  I'm depressed.  I've got a fucked up marriage.  Let me smoke some dope. 
[00:19:30]  Let me put a needle in my arm.  Let me drink a fifth of Jack and let me get rid of my problems and drown them.  Guess what?  When you get sober, the problem hasn't gone anywhere.  And that's why a lot of people, when they use a substance, whether it's alcohol, drugs,  and I think, listen, I'm a libertarian.  If you want to smoke dope or drink, you don't hurt what you want.  Dewey decimal system.  You know?  But here's the deal.  If you use a substance, you get high.  When you're sober, the problem is here.  You need to get counseling.  You need to grow up, be a fucking man, and deal with your problems, okay? 
[00:20:00]  I don't buy this shit that I'm an addict.  I can't help myself for me.  Another thing you all got to realize, and all you listeners, these diseases, it's big  fucking business.  Look at the addiction centers out there.  It's a billion dollar fucking business, and nobody understands that.  I'm not going to mention names.  Look at the clown on TV who wears the blue scrubs, sells books.  It's big fucking business.  That's what it is.  Look at pharmacies.  Dr.  There's a bunch of them. 
[00:20:30]  Dr.  Oz.  Dr.  Oz.  Yeah, Dr. Oz.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's up there with Dr. Phil, you know?  I love when he's diagnosing people on the stage.  Yeah.  You know, your wife loves you.  It's all common fucking sense.  People can take care of themselves.  I don't know.  Common sense.  Common sense.  I don't know.  You know what, though?  Honestly, it's like, I don't know if common sense is like, I don't know if that's, if  someone's shooting heroin, I'll even say something like that, or in that type of a fucking 
[00:21:00]  thing, I don't know if it's just, you know, pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  Chin up, fella.  My dad used to say that one all the time, too.  Common sense, Joseph.  Basic common sense, Joseph.  My brother would be like, I don't even know what that is.  Only because...  Only because the results are the same for so many people, like, everybody winds up in  the same place with that stuff.  It just seems like there's a little bit more to it than that.  And they do wind up in the same place.  And I'll grant you that when you're under the influence, when you've got it in your body, 
[00:21:30]  some people can't just stop cold turkey and kick it.  But when you've got the heroin out of your body, or the alcohol, or whatever, it's not  a physiological dependence at that point.  It's a matter of taking a look at your life and asking yourself, why am I using this fucking  shit to excess?  Right.  Okay.  Okay?  When you're under the influence, yeah, you have no control.  I've got a lot of friends that have had addiction problems.  They've been there.  And they can't stop.  But once they get into treatment, and they've detoxed, and they're 20 or 30 days down the road, 
[00:22:00]  and they get into therapy, and look, if AA works for you, great.  If cognitive behavioral therapy works for you, great.  If just say no works for you, great.  But once it's out of your body, there's really no reason.  There's not a demon in your body that's making you take that pill and shoving it down your  throat.  It's your own personal choice.  It is a personal choice to pick up, absolutely.  Although there's more to the mental part of it.  And I'm not saying it's an excuse, because I haven't done it in many years. 
[00:22:30]  And, you know, believe me, I'm not saying I'm driven and forced to do it at all.  I'm lucky I have a choice.  But there is more to it than my mind just going, eh, go ahead, do it.  It's a really weird mental state you get into, where, like, what insanity is it that tells  me to do it, even though I know?  It's like, I never have an urge.  I never have an urge to stick my hand in a toaster.  Like, never.  Because that's self-destructive and crazy.  But, like, these other weird things, I have this obsession to do sometimes. 
[00:23:00]  Not necessarily drink, but the other stuff.  It's like, what the fuck is wrong with me that I have this obsession, even if I don't  do it?  That's right.  And you've been, I don't know if you've been down the road of substance abuse, okay?  But I can tell you, personally, I have.  Yeah.  And I can tell you that, in most cases, and I think virtually in all cases, it's a matter  of having issues in your past or your present, and you use the substance to ease the psychological  pain. 
[00:23:30]  You know?  You've got to face the demons.  Yeah.  That's really what it comes down to.  I kind of feel weird when, I don't buy it sometimes when diseases are geographical, either.  Like, okay, you've got, like, anorexia.  You don't find anorexia in, like, third world nations.  You find it here in the United States more than anywhere else, among usually very wealthy  families, young girls in wealthy families, like that. 
[00:24:00]  Now, they consider it a disease, but, you know, how could that be if it's not, if it's  very geographical?  Although, I will say, you don't see Ebola in too many places, either.  Well, that's true.  That's true.  A little about Ebola.  But alcohol, the thing with alcohol or drugs or any of that stuff is you do see, like,  these recovery things.  And I went through it when I was really young.  I mean, you might have had a much longer history with it than I did.  But they, it's the same all over the world.  Like, you know, whether it's in Russia or, I know people that have traveled and gone 
[00:24:30]  to meetings in other places and know, like, it's the exact same fucking Russians are crazy.  Yeah.  They love a good fucking bender.  So do we Irish.  Oh, hey, hey, we're Irish.  I got to get into the office.  All right.  All right.  Have a good fucking day.  Thank you.  All right.  Great phone call.  Thank you, Dr. J.  Although, I will thank Dr. J., but I feel bad for anyone who's got, like, a real issue.  Hey, Dr., my chest.  I have to deal with him.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, don't be such a cocksucker.  Quit smoking, dummy.  Suck it up.  He tells it like it is.  Yeah, Dr. J. is not a good side. 
[00:25:00]  He's the club soda Kenny of bedside manners.  Yeah, he doesn't play.  No, right to the point.  Oh, I think I got to blow my nose.  Lucky my nose.  Here are the phone calls.  These fat fucks don't have a disease.  Gambling is a disease.  My accountant comes in.  You want to talk to him?  Yeah, because that's the same thing.  Who are you, buddy?  Ray, it looks like.  Borgata Ray.  Borgata Ray.  Oh, you could call.  It would be Ray.  Yeah, what's up, Ray?  Why Borgata Ray? 
[00:25:30]  Because I go down to the Borgata all the time, and that's a disease.  Were you the one tweeting the pictures at the blackjack table?  Yeah, I was sitting at the table.  Yeah.  I was selling the $100 chips.  What's that?  Yeah, yeah.  I was tweeting for you.  Yeah, he got me all fucking wound up.  He's like, hey, check out where I am.  I'm like, God, I want to go there.  Yeah, that's, I think gambling is definitely a disease when you're at that table, and you  just, especially when you're losing, you're chasing money, you just feel compelled to throw  more and more money out there, and, you know, it's, and fuck these fat people. 
[00:26:00]  Tell them to stop putting the greasy french fries and pork chops in their mouth.  So wait, but Jimmy would say it's very similar.  It's the same thing.  Yeah.  It's that chasing, and I think food's even harder than gambling, because you have to  eat to survive.  Imagine if you had to gamble to survive.  Like, imagine if when you woke up, in order to survive, you had to fucking go and play  three hands, and stop.  Like, if you're, that's what it's like for people with food addictions, man.  It's a fucking, I think it's the hardest one. 
[00:26:30]  Sex is really hard, because you have to, everyone thinks sexually, and, but food is  a mother, I'm like, God, I don't, I don't.  I fucking envy people with that one, man.  That's a, look at Bobby Kelly, our friend Bob, who's, who's struggled with that, and  I'm not making fun of him at all.  It's like, Bobby's a smart guy, as much as we shit on him.  He knows, but it's, it's, and I've watched him go through this, like, the compulsion  or the obsession, and, and he knows better.  Right.  Like, and I know better with certain things, and I still do them anyway, and what is this  insanity that makes you keep doing this stuff, even though you know it's deadly for you? 
[00:27:00]  I wish I knew what it was.  I mean, especially when you're down, and then you pull out a marker, and then another  marker, and then the guy said, you lose it, and you go, you, you go home after that weekend,  and you're like, what the hell?  Like, like you said, you just want to take that rape shower.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got something to do with something your brain releases, dude.  That fucking, what is it?  The, uh, dopamine, or, yeah, whatever, doordorphins.  There's some kind of a thing that that releases, and it's all the same for drinking, drugs,  food, fucking, gambling.  It's all the same thing that's released in the brain. 
[00:27:30]  It's definitely, it's a big rush that does something to the brain.  Yeah.  Are you up or down?  I'm up.  I'm up over the last couple years.  Nothing, nothing crazy, but I'm definitely up.  Wow.  Jesus.  Everyone's up.  No matter who.  Yes.  They're up.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take care.  My sister-in-law is obese.  It's not a disease.  It's a choice.  This guy lost 130 pounds and gained it right back.  Eating is a habit.  Has gotten down to 180 pounds.  Wants to ask Jimmy what it would be like if he had to take a drink every day. 
[00:28:00]  That's exactly, okay, yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy pretty much just said that.  He can't imagine.  Exactly.  It's an addiction.  I got extremely overweight and couldn't even wipe my own ass.  I turned my addiction around.  Stop with the sex talk.  Dave in Pennsylvania.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Dave.  So you're saying it's definitely a disease or an addiction?  No, it's not a fucking...  It's an addiction.  It's like anything else, man.  Dude, you got to find them out.  You know, I got so fat, I couldn't even wipe my own ass. 
[00:28:30]  I almost dislocated my shoulder.  That was a fucking wake-up call.  How much did you get up to?  400 pounds.  I think we went first to 400 pounds, and they can't wipe their own ass.  It's a life-changing experience, you know?  And I'm down to, like, 250, feels great.  You know, I battle with every day, like, people with, you know, alcohol, drugs.  It's just different people, you know?  I mean, I get hot coke, everything else. 
[00:29:00]  But you put a cheeseburger there, I'll put the cheeseburger over freaking coke or pot or heroin.  Yeah.  It's a disease.  I mean, it's a addiction.  All right, a couple questions.  So when you're eating that cheeseburger, you know you don't want to eat the cheeseburger, but you can't help yourself?  Can't help yourself, man.  You know, I go there, you're so hungry, I order three cheeseburgers filled with the first one,  but I got to shove the other two down because they taste so good.  See, when I eat bad for a meal, I guess, or a couple meals, I'm good. 
[00:29:30]  Then I'm done.  I don't even think about it again for a while.  Bacon's good.  Like, I don't understand the people that, they know they're eating bad, they get it over with,  and they eat bad, but then the next day they've got to eat bad again and continue.  Like, to me, I almost am sick, sick to my stomach.  I'm glad I went and got the greasy cheeseburger and the fries and all that shit.  But then I move on, back to, you know, regular eating, for me.  No, but with me, I'm eating a cheeseburger or something else. 
[00:30:00]  I'm thinking about the next thing I'm going to make.  Wow.  I'm thinking, like, I'll have, like, you know, Bill Parham in the oven cooking away.  I don't have to make a sandwich because I'm so hungry.  Wow, shit.  So I can eat that Bill Parham, and after eating that Bill Parham, I'm thinking, well, I'm going to have ice cream.  Sit down for a minute.  Right.  Holy fuck.  All right, so my other question is, how did you break this, I'll call it a cycle.  How did you break the cycle where you realize, fuck, I'm done, I've got to stop?  You know what? 
[00:30:30]  Eating little things at a time, going in and making a smaller decision.  Like, I'll go in and, like, maybe, like, I'll have some crackers in a truck.  I'm a truck driver.  And I'll have that to calm down my hunger.  So when I go someplace, I'll try to make a more sensible decision.  But if I don't eat for a while, I get ravenous.  And I just got to eat everything in sight.  You know, I know that's my personality.  Right, right.  But the weird thing is this, and this is where I kind of, like, all right, people who will read, like, again, I've given them a lot of shit.  But I saw somebody in the street the other day in our neighborhood. 
[00:31:00]  They were in, like, one of those fucking fat people, like, you know, like, carts.  Scooters.  Scooter.  And it was hot out.  And this person was, like, 600 pounds.  Ah.  And I'm, like, as much as I wanted to just grab them and go, fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty.  I'm, like, who enjoys being this way?  I really thought of that.  I'm, like, there's no way this person, as much as they're shoving bad stuff in there, is enjoying every donut they eat.  Yeah.  There's no way that person eats that donut and goes, ah, this is delicious. 
[00:31:30]  Life is good.  Like, what inside of you is making you make what is such a miserable fucking choice every time?  It's, like, believe me, I love cake and donuts and all that stuff.  But that's insanity.  Like, to, you know, to do something so fucking self-destructive that you're literally incapacitated.  You can't walk.  You're way beyond, you know, oh, boy, fatty loves a good piece of cake.  Like, it's, like, that's just a fucking self-destructive, that's, like, a shotgun blast.  Sounds like hell. 
[00:32:00]  But you're eating the bullets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sounds like hell.  Yeah.  Just on that scooter.  You know, I hear an act having a needle in their arm, breaking up with a needle in their arm going, holy shit, what got me here, you know?  Yeah, I got to do this again.  Dave, in front of you.  I got to do this again.  And they do.  You know, they do it over and over again.  But those people that get, you know, I hate people that are sitting around in those chairs.  And it's because they're fucking fat.  I mean, you got to take control of your life.  And, you know, I did. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, it had to be 400 pounds, which I wish it wasn't such a high weight.  But all these people, it's just their own decision.  And they're in the biggest week.  Right.  Fuck it, you know.  I'm 400 pounds.  Screw it.  This is where I'm going to be.  You know, I got a disease.  And they're blaming on that.  And Dave, finally, who wiped your ass?  Yeah.  I did it myself.  I had to actually get a towel, wet a towel that you dry yourself off with and take it 
[00:33:00]  from my front to my back and go back and forth and get the shit all over the towel to clean  my ass.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's so fucked up where it took me about a solid month and a half to get back to reaching  my hand around.  I mean, that was my huge incentive.  Do you remember the first time you had to do that?  Because there had to be a last time you wiped your ass successfully and then a first time  you needed the towel. 
[00:33:30]  Do you remember that first time?  Yes, I remember it.  I was reaching around and I was like, what the fuck's going on?  Did I hurt my shoulder?  I reached around so hard, I heard a snap in my shoulder.  I had to go to the doctor because it was killing me.  And I explained to him how I did it.  It was so fucking embarrassing.  And he just told me, you got to lose weight.  You know, I guess I pulled my shoulder out.  Yeah, when you need Tommy John surgery after a good shit, it's time to drop a few. 
[00:34:00]  Wow, I've never heard of that towel thing before.  We've been doing this a long time.  Something new.  Very embarrassing.  No kidding.  Well, good for you that you figured some shit out there, Dave.  Okay, thanks, Dave.  I enjoy you guys.  Listen to you guys all the time.  Thanks, Dave.  Thanks, Dave.  Just going back and forth with that towel.  Oh, my God.  Just get all your balls.  Just smearing shit everywhere.  Oh, man.  He's flossing his ass with a towel is what he's fucking doing. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, we forgot to ask him.  What do you do with the towel?  Do you just throw it away?  Is he washing them?  Are we going to put that in the hamper?  I know.  There are guests coming over and showering.  You got a towel?  I could use.  I've never heard of that before.  Oh, it's terrible.  Standing up like a sculpture.  Hey, Eric, let me ask you.  I'm not even making fun of you.  No, I'm not making fun of you.  Oh, boy.  You fucking eat a lot.  Do you feel like you have that compulsion?  I'm not shitting on you.  Not to that degree. 
[00:35:00]  No, of course not.  No, I don't mean to the towel.  There's times where it happens, yeah, but it's not like all the time.  And it's not like fast food and cakes and sweets and stuff like that.  It's regular food.  Oh, boy.  Chicken, steak, seafood, things like that.  Seafood, eat food.  I think Roland's a food addict.  Yeah?  Yeah, I do.  I think Roland will tell you that.  I think he must know it.  I think Roland knows.  He's coming in.  He loves a good fucking anything.  He does.  But do you regret after you get made fun of on the show for it? 
[00:35:30]  Do you regret after you've eaten something?  Do you know, like, oh, that was a mistake.  I wish I hadn't done it.  Do you have that part of it?  Again, it's certain foods, because sometimes I'll eat something, and I'll know it'll kill my stomach, and I'm aware of it, and I still ate it.  And that's when you're just like, why did I eat?  I know the consequence of this.  Why did I do that?  T-Roc just weeping.  Why did I eat that?  Roland!  Yeah.  Delicious food, people.  Come on.  If it wasn't for us, people would be out of business. 
[00:36:00]  Oh.  And people need to keep in mind it's delicious, right?  It is.  Fuck anybody who wants a bad meal.  Do you think that you're an addict, though?  Do you think you're addicted to it?  No.  No?  Okay.  I'm addicted to good food, though.  To good food.  Yeah, I mean, if you take me to McDonald's, I'll say, what an asshole.  Take me to, like, a nice steak restaurant.  I go, that's a good guy.  I don't know.  I've shared some Wendy's meals with you.  Oh.  But I just don't like it, though.  And you still eat it.  You're kind of making my point.  That's the crazy part.  Some people, if you're doing it and not enjoying it, that's... 
[00:36:30]  No, I just have, when they go...  But I haven't been back in a while, though, since last year.  It's like a social thing?  Yeah, like, I'll take a shitty burger.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Then I know I'll shit it right out.  That's Wendy's guarantee.  Yeah.  That's the Wendy's guarantee.  In one hole, out the other.  That is just gonna fucking drop right out of you.  Right.  Those calories don't count.  No, they don't count.  If I get stressed or sad, I go to my bakery, my little hubs, I call them.  Hubs.  What do people eat when they're stressed or sad? 
[00:37:00]  It's that release, man.  I think it's the same reason I'll jerk off.  Bates, pies.  Jerk off.  Puddings.  You'll search that stuff out if you're a little sad.  Search it.  I got people on my Rolodex.  I just text them.  The way Roland is throwing stuff into the food world, it's like me working around porn.  Like, I certainly get it.  Oh, boy.  It's like there's jerk-off shops all over the city, whatever.  That's exactly what it is.  Like, he goes for a cupcake, I'll walk into a booth, and we'll meet in the middle.  We just won't shake hands.  It's like, I know my bakery people, like, oh, I had a hard day. 
[00:37:30]  They go, why don't you stop by?  We got a little treat for you.  I'm like, all right.  So I go back in the kitchen.  They go, look, we got a little pie.  A little pie sounds so good.  Who doesn't love a good treat?  I love a treat.  But, like, when you try to diet, and then you end up going back to the treats, do you think  it's a compulsion, or?  You know, it just, I mean, when you go to these people, like, hey, come to our restaurant,  we're going to take care of you, and they throw all this food at you, like, I'm full.  Like, no, I have a little bite.  I guess that's a different thing, too, because Roland's got so many connections.  Opportunities, too, yeah.  And, like, people are throwing stuff at him, and he's built this reputation as somebody. 
[00:38:00]  As a foodie.  Who loves a delicious meal.  Plus, it's like culture, though.  Like, Mexicans, Italians, they feed you to death.  Mexicans.  Mexicans.  Mexicans.  Here, have something.  You doing your food show this weekend?  The 29th, I will.  Oh.  Yeah.  Those are always good.  Yes.  The Cronut King is coming in, too.  The Cronut guy?  Wait, you got the Cronut guy?  Yeah.  But we can't get the Cronut guy.  Yeah, because we're bros.  The guy, we totally blew us up.  Son of a bitch.  Is he bringing Cronuts with him?  For me, yeah.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  We can't get a Cronut. 
[00:38:30]  Well, Fallon can't get, because the Questlove text the guy, too.  Yeah.  And he said, yeah, you can wait in line.  Wait, wait, wait.  That guy's really stupid, though, because...  The Cronut King's an asshole.  I love him.  You might be friends with him, but he's an asshole.  He's a dummy.  He should be making a lot more, and he should be giving Jimmy Fallon a Cronut.  Because they're going to promote you for free in front of a million people.  He's just an asshole, because eventually, the buzz is going to go away, and he's still  got Cronuts to sell.  Ah, but he's working on a new dessert that he's going to announce on my show.  Ah.  But he's fucking...  He's overplaying his hand as this hard-to-get thing, and it's like, I can see if it's $500 
[00:39:00]  meals, but it's a $4 Cronut or $5 Cronut.  Make a shitload.  It's amazing, though.  I'm sure it's good.  Strike while the iron is hot.  Dude, if Fallon wants to promote you, or if Mayor Bloomberg wants them, you're a dummy  to not accommodate that.  Right.  That's bad business.  That's not being...  Mayor Bloomberg hates fat people, so I'm not...  Yeah, Bloomberg's irritating.  You know, he isn't irritating.  But I agree, though, with Fallon, that you should just give him whatever he wants.  I like him. 
[00:39:30]  But the Cronut guy's coming by.  I got a family barbecue.  They're going to make me tons of pitmaster food, like hogs.  They're going to barbecue a whole hog.  Wow.  Right here in the studio.  No, outside, they're going to do it.  I know.  Like Fox does.  I love Lady Di.  No, no, they wouldn't do it here.  No, no.  Lady Di who answers jokes.  That's just amazing.  Oh, no.  I love how Roland took it from, do you have a food addiction?  No.  But I will tell you this.  The Cronut man is coming, as are the pitmasters. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  More importantly, we got another guy who wants to talk about wiping his ass.  I knew this would lead to more people calling about wiping their ass.  Great.  Let's say hi to Joe in Indiana, it looks like.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, Indiana, it's totally said hello.  Okay, so I'm 6'7", and I weigh 470 plus pounds.  Wow.  Jesus.  That's a big boy.  With giant dumps.  I'm a big motherfucker. 
[00:40:30]  I can wipe my own ass.  I'm happy to report that I can still, in fact, wipe my own ass.  I have gotten to the point where it's a little difficult to do the reach around.  But for us fatties, there's a store called Living XL.  Yes, they sell a product called The Bathroom Buddy.  Oh, we've heard about The Bathroom Buddy.  We've done a break on it.  Which one was that?  Was that on a stick?  It was a stick with the little thing, and you put the paper in there, and then you press  the thing, and it falls into the turlet. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, you've got to use a stick.  The Bathroom Buddy.  Dude, aren't you tired of living like that, though?  Wouldn't you like to be able to just do something that a child can do and just wipe your own  ass?  Don't you want to snap The Bathroom Buddy in half and throw it in the wastebasket and move  on with your life?  To break it over your big, giant leg.  Oh, we've got to.  I do not want to live like this, period, ever.  I didn't wake up one morning and was 475 pounds.  I'm basically chewing my way to my own grave. 
[00:41:30]  What weight do you think you should be?  You're a tall fuck, but what weight would you think would be good for you?  300?  Yeah.  I was 300 when I played football back in high school, and even back then I was told  to do pushaways from the table instead of push-ups.  So I've been on a diet since I was eight, so this wasn't like a problem that snuck up  on me.  And I think what a lot of people get confused about is whether this is an addiction or if  it's a disease, it's both. 
[00:42:00]  And it's a really complicated question.  Why don't you go to Overeaters Anonymous meetings?  Is there such a thing?  Oh yeah, look up on the internet, it's called Overeaters Anonymous.  I've never been there.  I've heard great things about it.  All way.  But seriously, there's meetings, they're free, they cost nothing.  So why don't you just go there, and it's a lot of people who have food problems, and  give it a shot.  I'm not kidding, they really are.  I'm just laughing.  We're laughing at the Comfort Wipe commercial.  Comfort Wipe thing.  We'll watch your commercial too.  To keep your dignity. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  But you see how they make it look so easy, and then you push the button, and the paper  goes into the toilet.  Well, you know, shit ends up all over that thing.  Yes, it does.  No matter what you do.  The Comfort Wipe.  If I could only spend five minutes telling you what it's like to be this size, and the  amount of inhumane bullshit that I have to go through just to live my daily life, I don't  want to be this way, I'm not suicidal or anything, but trust me, I've been to nutritionists, I've 
[00:43:00]  been to, I've gotten all the way up to I'm going to have the gastric bypass, but the insurance  won't cover it, because it's not technically a disease, which it is technically now, according  to the AMA.  You know what, dude, can I interrupt you for one second?  I wonder if that will help a lot of fat people get that surgery.  That might have been one of the problems.  Maybe the insurance company is not classifying it, or because it's not classified a certain  thing, insurance is not covering it.  Like, they'd rather just have you drop dead.  So maybe this will help a lot more people get that...  That's great.  Higher premiums to pay for somebody's fucking... 
[00:43:30]  The fact that they can't control themselves, it's wonderful.  Well, you're already paying that higher premium.  Well, I know.  Because of diabetes.  You can feel sorry for yourself, I hope you don't do that.  If I get the diabetes, we're all...  Trial Readers Anonymous, just look it up online and see if it works.  All right, I'll give it a shot.  Good luck, man.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.  Bye, buddy.  All right.  What a big fat guy.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a big dude.  If you're putting toilet paper on a stick and fucking... 
[00:44:00]  It's just...  That's...  You know what I think that's good?  The first time you have to do that should be like...  A wake-up call?  That's it.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I can't wipe my ass.  If you're wiping your ass with a stick, you're really not getting it clean.  No.  Properly clean.  You're always leaving a little dirt behind.  That's going to make your ass a little swampy.  Yeah, you need the articulated fingers to kind of, you know, get all those nooks and crannies.  Yeah, get in there. 
[00:44:30]  You got to get in there.  You got to get in there.  You can't do that with a stick.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  I mean, there's plenty of phone calls.  Maybe Jimmy will tackle this today on the show.  My advice should.  Oh, that's this afternoon.  This afternoon?  Well, this morning.  Oh, I guess that's the afternoon for us.  I always think it's the afternoon once we leave.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I'm an idiot.  And when we come back, we talk about the insanity of this fucking...  How they want the cops to mention all the clothing and description, like... 
[00:45:00]  I can't even deal with this.  Who's behind...  Who...  What fucking...  What a crazy country we live in.  It's insanity.  Right.  Why?  It's ridiculous.  Like, are we that afraid to say black or white or what...  What a dishonest country.  It really is.  There's no need for it.  There's no reason for it.  Tell me the reason why a cop shouldn't be able to go,  All right, our suspect is a black male, and he was seen, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:45:30]  What is the reason?  Or Hispanic, or Asian, or whatever.  We know.  Pure lunacy in here.  The bill...  It really is.  Christine Quinn and some other...  LaMaine Williams, the deputy Democrats, are fighting, I guess, to have this bill passed.  You think it has a chance to be passed?  Oh, I bet it does.  I bet it has a chance.  I don't know.  As much as Bloomberg has been a little wishy-washy and irritating, 
[00:46:00]  he's a bit more of a...  He's for the stop and frisk.  I kind of have faith that Bloomberg will stop this one.  When you see the news doing that all the time,  not giving a description of perpetrators and whatnot,  that's one thing.  But when you listen to the police scanner, that's all they say.  Right.  I mean, it's always the first thing they're saying is race.  It's race, the sex of the person,  and then what they're wearing.  That's the description that they think is the best way to find somebody. 
[00:46:30]  And you're going to put the cops in some bad situations.  Right?  Oh, well, it's a male, and he's wearing a blue shirt.  A blue shirt.  And then the cops are like,  all right, well, there's four guys here with blue shirts.  Yeah.  Which one?  The black one.  Oh, all right.  All righty.  I don't know what the bill says.  Maybe the paper's getting it wrong, too.  I don't know exactly what the bill says.  Yeah, yeah, I'd like to delve into that after we get it.  Some of those bills are ridiculous.  I mean, they scare the fuck out of you in the paper,  and then you realize that they don't have a chance in hell of passing. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Who knows?  But the assholes that want this to pass.  Which one?  Quinn?  Christine Quinn.  Who's trying to be the mayor of this city, right?  Is she the lesbo?  The lesbo?  Yeah.  But I don't know if that's the bill.  The bill's about profiling.  I don't know if the bill has, you know,  because profiling never works, of course.  Oh, bill!  But that's the positive profile.  Yes, of course.  People are just unrealistic.  So unrealistic.  Ridiculous.  All right.  We got lots to do today.  Don't forget the podcast is up. 
[00:47:30]  Every Wednesday, the Opie and Anthony podcast.  This week, you got Scott Thorson, Liberace's ex-lover.  He gave us a great hour of radio.  Yeah.

[00:49:00]  Hey, good morning, everyone.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate it.  Jiminy Cricket.  Ah, fuck.  The hijinks we talk about in between these little segments that are on the air.  We're working on some things.  Uh-huh.  For next Friday's show?  Yes.  We're working on some things.  Little old school stuff.  Yes.  Wow.  Elijah Wood and Ricky Gervais coming in tomorrow.  Very cool.  Very, very cool.  Fucking Gervais, man. 
[00:49:30]  With his little learned guitar.  Right.  With fucking, what's his name?  His character from The Office.  David Brent.  David Brent.  Right.  It's hilarious.  Of course it's hilarious.  Guy's fucking funny as hell and has not blown us off, which is very nice of him.  And we got Elijah Wood, who's now kind of a friend of the show.  Elijah Wood.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, he's got a movie, I gather.  Right.  He's coming in.  That's cool.  Just to see your face. 
[00:50:00]  Put on that face, man.  Yeah.  Dumb smile.  Hello.  Hi.  Welcome to Learn Guitar with David Brent.  The camera cut.  He turns his head.  He's such an asshole.  Learn Guitar with David Brent.  You've tuned in.  Thank you. 
[00:50:30]  You want to learn to play guitar?  Okay.  Well, I'm not going to teach you.  What?  You're going to teach you.  He's gone mad.  I've always been mad.  I don't mean I've suffered mental illness.  Such a great character.  It's amazing.  Touch wood.  And I wouldn't joke about that.  I do know people who have suffered mental illness, and they are no fun to be around.  So, no, by mad, I mean zany. 
[00:51:00]  And so, you're going to get a little bit of that.  It's going to be fun.  You know, I'm not going to give you a boring lesson.  I'm not going to start at the beginning.  Hopefully, you've got a guitar.  I'm not going to bother to, you know, E, A, D, G, B, E.  Who cares?  What are you going to do with them?  Yeah?  What are you going to do with them? 
[00:51:30]  Whatever you like.  Within reason.  I'm not going to start by telling you all the chords.  You won't use half of them.  I will show you the main ones.  I'll get your face.  A minor.  You won't need B.  C.  D.  E. 
[00:52:00]  E minor.  F.  G.  That is all you'll need.  And I'm not going to tell you in what order they should be.  The order's up to you.  So, yeah, it's about doing your own thing.  It's saying, it's almost saying, don't listen to me.  No, I'm saying, um, I'm saying, listen, because I'm telling you to make your own mind up. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah?  Yeah?  I'm not saying, I'm not saying be like me.  I'm saying be like you.  You know, don't be like me.  You're going to get in trouble.  Oh.  That fucking dumb smile.  Oh, is he embarrassing?  Just teach.  I taught myself.  You know.  And I want to teach you to teach yourself.  If that's teaching. 
[00:53:00]  It is sort of, isn't it?  And enjoy it.  Uncomfortable laugh.  He's so unprepared for everything he does.  But the whole thing is just a segue into him performing.  This song is very personal.  How is he teaching anything?  To know.  Um, because it's about my chosen profession of repping.  Um, I'm up and down the country every day.  Meetings, um, selling, uh, cleaning products.  Um, not just cleaning products, you know, all sort of toiletry needs. 
[00:53:30]  Um, sanitary towel dispensers.  Uh, you know, urinal lozenges.  Everything, really.  Um, yeah, it's about that, really.  Urinal.  It's about that.  Oh, cakes, urinal lozenges.  On the road.  Check it out.  Um, it'd be better with a band.  It'd make more sense because I'm trying to do the bass line and the high stuff.  But, um, and the video is going to be amazing.  I look forward to that. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, all he wants to do is perform his song.  Yes, he's not teaching anything.  No.  Half a tank should get me to Milbank.  I'll fill her up and head down to Sit Cup.  It's just a meet-in.  It's only fleeting.  It's just a pitch and then I'm up to Ipswich. 
[00:54:30]  Life on the road.  Don't need a heavy load.  Oh, that's such bad words, huh?  Yeah, his faces are fucking great.  As you can see this on the YouTube.  Yeah.  His face is up on the YouTube.  Need a dealin', no feelin', strict business, I'm killin' it in witness. 
[00:55:00]  Then to Gloucester, I get a Costa.  Hard shoulder, coffee holder.  Life on the road.  Don't need a heavy load.  It's a road song, like bands have.  Well, you know, for a guy that's selling urinal lozenges.  Urinal lozenges, yes.  I wonder if we get an acoustic guitar if we'll, uh... 
[00:55:30]  Believe me, it's all I want to do.  There you go.  There you go.  That gives you an idea of my life.  Jesus.  Life.  That's E minor.  He doesn't know how to end anything. 
[00:56:00]  The great thing about him...  This is a song about just traveling across America.  It's almost symbolic.  It's just saying, go wherever you want.  Some people, you know, think, oh, I was born here.  I better work here.  I'm gonna die here.  You know.  I was born in Reading.  But, um, I'd moved to Slough before I was 30.  Sold my shack in Memphis.  Oh, shit.  He has a great... 
[00:56:30]  My...  The thing that I love is a song called Spaceman Came Down.  Yes.  Spaceman Came Down.  Here's why this is so brilliant.  Because the lyrics in the song are bad.  But it's just good enough to be believable.  Yeah.  Like, he doesn't make it so awful that it's over-the-top terrible.  Yeah.  They're actually, like, you see, like...  This is a real guy singing a real song.  That's the genius of it, is...  He was a musician first.  Yeah.  Gervais. 
[00:57:00]  Very smart.  He was in one of those extremely smart.  80s bands.  Well, we gotta get a guitar in here for Ricky Gervais tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Even if he just sings that one, that'd be great.  I want to hear Spaceman Came Down.  Oh, yeah.  Spaceman Came Down.  What a dope David Brent is.  Spaceman Came Down.  He really is.  You gotta find that.  Played a little bit on the show today.  It's not good.  Or Black Racial.  Speaking of funny people, a little segue here into Russell Brand and what he did on 
[00:57:30]  MSNBC the other day.  I heard about this, but I didn't hear it.  Well...  I guess he got a little upset with the people from Morning Joe.  Was it?  Yeah.  Russell Brand used to do our show.  We're very, very, very disappointed he decided to blow us off.  Because we had some good times with the guy.  Wow.  And, you know, he moved on, whatever.  It happens.  But it is kind of shitty.  Yeah, then you got guys like Ricky Gervais and Seth Rogen.  They continue to do our show. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  And they've become bigger.  They're huge.  I don't know why that happens sometimes.  Because we didn't have a problem with Russell Brand whatsoever.  Some guys are loyal and some guys aren't.  We actually had really good times with Russell Brand.  He was on two or three times.  We put him on before anybody else did on Saturday.  Before anyone knew him.  No one knew who he was.  He was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  He came out of nowhere.  Yep.  And we put him on.  And we had him on again by himself.  For his book.  And that went very well.  And then, for whatever reason, you know, he doesn't do our show anymore. 
[00:58:30]  And, you know, we're very disappointed by that.  With that said, he was on Morning Joe yesterday.  And he just beat the shit out of that blonde broad.  What's her name?  Mika?  Mika.  Yeah, Mika, like, who has to play Too Cool for the Room.  She's there without the Morning Joe guy.  She's insufferable.  Yeah.  And she was in way over her fucking head.  Well, none of them knew anything about him.  Right.  Like, it was the worst interview I've ever seen. 
[00:59:00]  But they weren't humble about it.  No.  She's basically, her excuse was, ah, I just don't know pop culture in general.  Well, what are you doing on this job?  Right.  And then she's getting mad after, ah, well, you'll see.  That's it.  You know, we should play this clip.  It's pretty good.  Play it, Sam!  And then he just beats the shit out of the media in general.  It's a terrific clip by Russell Brand.  Especially when he realizes that one of the women that's not Mika doesn't know his name.  Oh.  Right.  All right, joining us now, he's a really big deal. 
[00:59:30]  He's a big deal.  I know.  I'm told this.  I'm not very pop cultured.  I'm sorry.  Right there.  She's insufferable.  You're right.  She's a cunt off the bat there.  She's a cunt.  Within seconds.  Right.  She's already bashed him.  Right.  I'm being told he's a big deal.  How do you not know that Russell Brand is a big deal?  You're in the media.  Oh, what a fucking bitch.  How do you not know that?  But what a bitch thing to say.  Right before you're having an interview.  Right off.  He's fucking hateable.  Yeah, we've been saying that for fucking hateable.  A few years now. 
[01:00:00]  In the morning, Joe, when they start the show, you know, Joe is there.  Joe Scarborough, right?  Yeah.  And there's a cast of characters.  And a cast of other guys.  And they'll talk about, you know, the game or fucking some pop culture reference.  Something that everyone's talking about.  That everyone's talking about.  I think she had a problem when they were talking about the Super Bowl, if you remember.  They did a Super Bowl break.  She makes these fucking bitch faces.  And she's like, oh, can we get to the news?  Right.  All she wants to do is read the news.  Is read her teleprompter news.  And, you know, she knows nothing. 
[01:00:30]  I don't doubt she doesn't know who the fuck Russell Brand is.  Well, why the fuck is she?  Why did she get the big spot on TV?  Or prepare for the interview.  Yeah, prepare for the interview.  It's your job, lady.  It's your fucking job.  What a humorless bore she is.  And she thinks that she's going to be able to handle Russell Brand.  Start over, because that's great.  Because right out of the box, she's a cunt.  Yeah.  I hate you.  All right, joining us now, he's a really big deal.  He's a big deal.  I know.  I'm told this. 
[01:01:00]  I'm not very pop cultured.  I'm sorry.  Comedian, movie star, author, and host of the show, Brand X.  He's already.  Russell Brand.  He's pissed.  This summer, he's embarking on his first ever worldwide comedy tour, The Messiah Complex.  Caddy Kay and Brian Shackman are here as well.  He's already mad.  He's already told Brian that he might want to disrobe.  I'm just saying.  I just thought maybe I could loosen up a little, show a little more chest here, and he said  maybe I should do a little more.  I only think Russell can do that.  You look fantastic.  That is a very kind compliment.  You also look beautiful.  Brian, you are free to wear whatever you want. 
[01:01:30]  This is one of your freedoms that is afforded to you.  I appreciate that.  Uh-oh.  Silver boots.  The boots are fabulous.  I want to see them.  Come on.  Put them on the table.  Kinky boots time.  Wow.  There are some boots.  Those are nice.  Put your feet up, relax.  I wouldn't do that.  I don't want to disrespect your program.  Okay.  No, no.  You didn't ask to see the boots.  No, I did.  And I liked to.  Your fellow English woman, so I felt obliged.  We talked about kinky boots recently.  Yes.  It's fantastic.  You have to go.  Okay, Russell.  Oh.  Sorry about that.  That's all right.  You just disrespected the table. 
[01:02:00]  The table is in.  It's like your desk is a puzzle.  It is.  I'm sorry about that.  What is the solution?  I think we could walk back in.  Be careful, because that's a low-cut dress.  Oh, sorry.  Okay.  I'm only flesh and blood.  I've got instincts.  Oh, okay.  Tell me what you need to know.  I'm just going to have a drink here.  Katty K.  She has no idea what to do.  That's the name of your tour.  Yes.  Do you have one?  No.  It's a mental illness.  Right. 
[01:02:30]  And you don't have that either?  I hope that I'm here as a fully qualified professional gentleman.  None of us are.  Free from mental illness.  Free from it.  None of you.  This is a hotbed of neurosis and psychosis.  Oh, my word.  I'm grateful to be here.  But Joe's not here, so there are no messiahs.  That's true.  Although we actually bring more mental illness to the table than we admit, at least on this  side here, for sure.  So tell me about the tour.  You're starting in Abu Dhabi.  Is that where it began?  Yeah, it's in a lot of Middle Eastern nations and South Africa and all across Europe. 
[01:03:00]  And of course, in your wonderful country and in our country, I'm very, very, yeah, it's  really good tour.  I'm talking about Malcolm X, Che Guevara, Gandhi and Jesus Christ and how these figures are  significant culturally and how icons are appropriated and used to designate consciousness  and meaning particularly posthumously.  This is why his publicist stinks.  Like, I understand this is TV, but this is where you put Russell Brand for an interview. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  This is where your publicist throws you instead of on a show where you're talking to the  people who will come and see you.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  They're not.  No one is watching Mika.  Right.  And be like, oh, yeah, well, I want to see this guy.  I got to go see Russell Brand.  It's fucking.  And I could have stopped after no one is watching Mika.  She's trying, though.  Like, I don't hate her as much.  Yeah, after she said that stupid thing, she's trying to laugh and be fun.  Like, she's trying to make.  She's just unprepared.  I think she's lost.  Yeah, she's completely lost. 
[01:04:00]  And it gets way worse.  Because they kind of start mocking him.  And you'll see.  What brings all those people together?  They're all people that died for a cause.  They're all people whose icons are used to designate meaning, perhaps not in the manner  in which they intended.  I kind of like that.  That sounds dead serious.  Yeah, it's funny when you do it as a joke.  I'll take it seriously.  I'll just want to do it on stage.  Can't we get, like, you know, 30 seconds now?  What?  Oh, not really, love. 
[01:04:30]  I mean, this is good.  Jesus.  What a dumb question.  I hope that's not your message too, Gandhi, and the people of India.  You know, it's funny, though, because I travel a lot.  All these people are at work, are they?  Yeah, they're working.  They're just at work.  Work more quietly.  They're Facebooking, actually.  What are they doing?  They're Facebooking.  They're Facebooking.  Yeah.  Shopping.  A bit they can't look at pornography, a bit it's blocked on their website.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, boy. 
[01:05:00]  But they're allowed to look at, if they wanted to, they can tweet, they can Facebook.  Yeah, they have to.  That's part of their job.  They're probably tweeting right now.  They're tweeting themselves senseless back there.  Yeah.  Lovely.  That's to create the atmosphere of, we're a hotbed of news.  It's a working news.  Yeah.  They're actually actors.  They're all fully qualified actors.  They're all just now looking for acting work.  So people, I mean, you have a pretty broad range here.  I'm going to ask a serious question.  Can I try?  I'll try.  Try.  It's never going to work.  Go ahead.  Everyone asks, what do you like better, TV, movies, or stand-up? 
[01:05:30]  But actually, which one's more difficult?  I mean, going on stage, I think, is probably going to be pretty tough.  A movie can be boring because you shoot a thing a hundred times.  TV is what it is.  There are challenges in all of those different disciplines.  The thing I enjoy most is stand-up comedy because you're direct with your audience.  You can't be misinterpreted.  People can't get confused.  You know what happens if you work in media.  People like to change the information.  Mika hasn't even asked for anything or done it.  She just reacts to a particular agenda.  If you're in a room with people, then what you're saying is clear.  If you say something that people are confused about, you can explain it to them then. 
[01:06:00]  If you say something because it's a joke, people can't pretend that you're saying it seriously.  So I like having direct communication with people because I believe people are very, very intelligent.  But the information gets manipulated a lot and people like to cause fake stirs and stuff.  It's funny, the accent, you know, when I see them in person, it's totally fine.  Forgetting Sarah Marshall or the TV show, it's fine.  But on satellite radio in the car, I can't understand a single joke.  You can't understand it.  Can you understand me?  Yes, but I'm telling you, when I'm driving in the car and everyone's laughing in the audience of the radio, 
[01:06:30]  I'm like, I have no idea what he's saying.  It's best you focus on your driving.  You're a man, you don't want to be distracted by humor.  You might crash into a pedestrian.  I think it's probably for the best.  I think I'm just, this is my first brand.  I think it's not listening to them, it's experience.  It's just sort of taking it all in.  You are talking about me as if I'm not here and as if I'm an extraterrestrial.  You know I'm from a country that's near to you.  We're just sort of admiring the whole, you know, it's the whole thing. 
[01:07:00]  Well, thank you for your casual objectification.  I'm glad that it's positive for you.  It's very positive, absolutely.  Any other questions?  You've become nervous.  Why are you nervous?  You're a powerful woman, you've got a lovely job.  What seems to be the trouble?  I don't know.  You've got a hair like Princess Diana.  Oh, wow.  The British woman is now calling him Willie. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  Willie.  Because she thinks that's his name.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, he's...  Went from Russell to Willie.  Wait, that's not Willie Geist, right?  Willie Geist is not...  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Okay, wow.  All right, she's calling him Willie.  Right.  Mika now has no idea what to do.  She says she's nervous, but she's just lost.  Right.  She doesn't know how to conduct an interview with this guy. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  Because she doesn't know anything about him.  Nothing about him, and she doesn't know how to conduct an interview with a pop culture guy.  Right.  Like, she'll sit there and probably talk to a politician if she's prepared enough, but...  Right.  I don't know.  Wow, this is uncomfortable.  I guess the guy who usually pipes questions into her ear as it's happening,  isn't piping the right questions in.  Right.  Right.  Mannequins.  She's just moved down the other end.  I absolutely love this.  Keep going.  Willie, what seems to be the trouble? 
[01:08:30]  No, I'm good.  We're now going to do a bit of therapy.  Would you do therapy with Willie Brandt?  With who?  Willie Brandt.  Would you do therapy with him?  No.  Willie Brandt.  Because that's where he's heading.  Okay.  I'm all right.  You shouldn't say he when a person is present.  You should refer to the person by the name.  That's basically good manners.  That is where Willie is heading.  Willie.  Who is Willie?  Okay, Russell Brandt.  Is this what you all do for a living?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm here to...  I'm professional.  Okay, well, let me help you.  I'm here to promote a tour called Messiah Complex. 
[01:09:00]  It's here for the people of America.  I want the people of America to come and see me do stand-up.  Go to russellbrandt.tv where you can purchase tickets to see me.  These people, I'm sure, are typically very, very good at their job.  Well, actually, you're conveying news to the people of America.  Yeah.  People of America, we're going to be okay.  Everything's all right.  These are your trusted anchors.  Even leaning.  There's that news link.  Give us your papers.  I'll shuffle them for you.  I'll shuffle them.  Yeah, shuffle them.  Give us that.  That's good.  Pen.  You need a pen.  Okay.  Coming up later.  Thank you very much, Kat.  Okay, we're going to be talking about the situation with Edward Snowden. 
[01:09:30]  And this whistleblower, is it good, what he's done for America, or are our secrets being jeopardized by his intentions?  We're going to be talking about that.  Also, Bradley Manning.  Is Bradley Manning an American hero, or is he compromising the safety of American troops?  We care about your views here on Morning Joe.  We'll be talking about those later.  Here with me are Brian and Kat.  Brian, nice time.  What do you think about Edward Snowden?  What do you think about the situation with Snowden?  Have you got anything to hide?  Should we be concerned about the revelations that are occurring? 
[01:10:00]  I don't know what's wrong with you.  I understand everything he's saying.  No, it's because you're looking at him.  When you don't see him, you don't see the lips.  I understand the whole thing.  Stop saying he on prison.  Oh, my God.  This is getting really uncomfortable.  I wish Russell would have addressed the fact that she fucked up.  He said, who's that?  Yes.  And then the other one jumped in and said, Russell.  I wish he would have really got her for that.  Oh, man.  She's been calling him Willie.  And there's no acknowledgement that he just did their job better than that.  Very easily.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, just grab papers and started talking. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, very easily.  He did exactly what they did.  He wasn't even...  By the way, if you can't see, he wasn't reading the papers.  No, he was rattling off.  He was just looking at the camera.  Yeah, of course.  And he happened to be aware of what's going on.  He just alpha-mailed that entire table.  Yes, he did.  Because he got irritated.  Yeah, he is irritated.  You could tell.  You're manners.  You're good.  You're polite.  I'm coming in tomorrow with a big necklace, and I'm opening up.  Look beyond the superficial.  That's the problem with current affairs.  You forget about what's important.  You allow the agenda to be decided by superficial information. 
[01:11:00]  What am I saying?  What am I talking about?  Don't think about what I'm wearing.  These things are redundant.  I'm distracted.  Okay.  Don't be distracted.  What do you think that gesture means, the way you're touching that bottle?  What does that indicate?  Oh, shit.  What is that?  What's the subtext of that?  She's jerking off the water bottle.  You need to lose that ring, Mika, because it don't mean nothing to you.  She's grasping for the sharp.  She's a sharp, grasping for the sharp.  She's a sharp, grasping for the sharp.  We'll buy tickets.  We'll buy tickets.  Absolutely. 
[01:11:30]  We don't need to see the tour.  I got it now.  August.  The.  Russell Brand.  Massiah complex.  Thank you.  The tour.  Messiah complex.  She's lost.  It starts in August in Abu Dhabi, right?  He was fucking great.  That was great.  She was fucking out of that.  Great.  Huh?  She's a sharp, grasping.  Soft, grasping.  Wow.  Soft, grasping.  Soft, grasping.  Ah.  Take off that ring, because it don't mean nothing to you.  He was pissed.  Oh, look at me.  Referring to her wedding ring. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  I always forget to turn my ringer off.  And the lovely Dr. Steve.  Disappointing we can't get him anymore.  Fuck you.  It's very disappointing, man.  He was in last week.  I know, but he wouldn't come on our show.  Yeah, he forgot all about us years ago.  Very strange.  But he did, like, it's very strange.  I don't know.  There must be some kind of miscommunication, because it's not like he came in and only did Stern and left.  Like, he did every show.  He did Shade.  He did Shade.  He did P. Dominic.  He did, like, all the shows.  And I don't see Russell.  I don't, I literally don't think Russell, like, if Howard would say, I don't think anybody said to Russell, you did Howard, you can't do Opie and Anthony. 
[01:12:30]  That's the type of thing that would irritate him.  He's had six million followers on Twitter.  I don't think he's, like, obsessing over Howard.  And he's obviously trying to promote what he's doing.  That's his fucking publicist.  Yeah.  Guaranteed.  They probably told him bullshit.  Nah, I hope he and Anthony's booked.  Well, what does Roland know about this over the years?  You'd have to ask him.  Who's his publicist?  You'd have to ask Roland.  It's like, I'm tired of the fucking, sometimes, remember when we couldn't get Louie that day?  Because he was doing Howard, and we just went right to Louie. 
[01:13:00]  He goes, yeah, I'll come over.  Uh-huh.  It's always the fucking publicist.  Cocksucker publicist.  Always.  Mm.  Fucking assholes.  Fucking assholes.  Where's Roland?  He's on his way.  Oh, okay.  Rolando.  Uh, remember Lil Wayne stomping all over the American flag?  Uh-huh.  Saying he didn't do it on purpose.  That's bullshit.  Right.  That's bullshit.  That's what I was thinking, because that's what I was trying to say yesterday.  Of course it's bullshit.  He's got scared.  But if he's shot from the waist up, and the flag falls, and you just see what's behind 
[01:13:30]  the flag, like, he may not have been stomping the flag as part of the video.  It doesn't matter if it's on camera or off camera.  The basic fact is, if this is the type of thing that bothers you, seeing the American  flag being, you know, desecrated, that, it doesn't matter if it's on video or not.  The fact of the matter is, but he didn't do it as the statement that people think he  did.  Like, whether it's unpatriotic or not, you could still argue that, definitely, because  he did it.  But he wasn't making the statement, hey, look at me, I'm stomping on the flag. 
[01:14:00]  On video.  Right.  I mean, you listen to the words of the song, though.  Yeah, that's true.  It goes with the song.  It does go with the song.  What is he talking about?  I think he did it in such a way where he could explain his way out of it.  Like, look, I didn't do that on purpose.  The flag happened to fall, and I was singing and doing my thing.  Does he seem like the type that would lie, though?  Like, here's why.  He probably got a little scared.  I don't think so.  Did you see him in that?  He doesn't care.  Did you see that deposition video?  He doesn't give a fuck.  He doesn't give a fuck, Lil Wayne.  He doesn't care, man. 
[01:14:30]  He did a year in Rikers.  So it's a coincidence that he's stomping on the, or dancing on the flag.  He's quite drunk, not paying attention.  He's probably a purple drink.  But the song itself is controversial about America.  And then he's also stepping all over the flag, and now he's trying to say he didn't do it  on purpose?  I'm suspicious.  I don't know what the motive is there to lie.  I don't think he respects the, you know, the country and its symbolisms and all that.  And the song sucks. 
[01:15:00]  That's horrible.  It's horrible.  It's horrendous.  That's why I was laughing yesterday.  Yeah.  Some asshole on Twitter was trying to, you know, start something.  Oh, Ope was laughing at the Lil Wayne Stumper on the flag thing.  No, I was laughing at Lil Wayne, because he looked like a fool.  He looked like a jerk is what he looked like.  A big jerk.  And the song was awful.  The whole thing was laughable.  The guys out there were Twittering, you support him, stop him.  Yes.  A hundred percent.  Even though I don't agree with it, he has every right to do it.  People get confused by that. 
[01:15:30]  All these fake patriots out there.  If you're a patriot, you've got to support that.  Yes.  Just don't buy the album.  It doesn't mean you're happy about it, but people get confused.  And it does send a message as to how he feels about, you know, the country and its symbolisms.  Yeah, I think it does send a message like that.  But I feel like, and I'm tired of everybody lumping veterans into everything, because that's  a fake way, like, hey, you're disrespecting veterans.  Like, every time you say something about the country you don't like, it doesn't mean you're 
[01:16:00]  disrespecting veterans.  Yeah, I know.  That is a cop out.  Veterans are probably the most respected group, and justifiably so, and the country should have  been fucking nicer to them after Vietnam.  But just because you, if you have a problem with a lot of the things America has done,  it doesn't mean you don't respect veterans that fought and died.  If you have, I have issues with America, where the flag annoys me sometimes, not because  of the government even, because of the people in it, because of this fucking fake free speech 
[01:16:30]  and free thought thing that we think we have and we don't.  We don't.  And it's not about the awful government or the soldiers.  It's us.  It's the public letting each other swing by the neck for saying unpopular things, and  yet, boy, you wouldn't violate our privacy, and we cry like little fucking babies.  So I have my issues where I don't mind seeing the flag fucking stamped, because, again, it's  the fucking phony Americans.  The troops are like the last group I'm irritated with.  Not at all.  Look, he's walking all over the flag. 
[01:17:00]  He's completely aware he's walking all over the flag, but he's making it look like it  might have been by accident.  And even the basic principle of what they're doing here, like, there's people up on a ladder,  they were holding the flag, and they want the flag to drop and reveal a bunch of fucking  people that are probably on welfare.  Right.  So the flag falls.  Just to set it up, no one looked and said, hey, by the way, when you let go of that top  of the flag, it's going to go on the ground, and that's not really how the flag is supposed  to be treated.  I don't think he cares that he's walking on it.  Of course.  But I think that... 
[01:17:30]  They don't care that they dropped it on the ground.  Right.  They don't care that they're walking on it.  Right.  They're treating it like a piece of set decoration.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Thank you.  That's it.  Right.  But it's not like he was walking on it as, like, look at my video, I'm walking on the  flag.  No, he's doing it on purpose.  Okay.  I hear what you're saying.  But he's doing it on purpose.  He knows exactly what he's doing.  So he should be brave enough to actually stomp the fuck out of the flag.  He didn't put this video out.  Yeah, it's not for him.  This is just some cell phone video.  No, of course it's cell phone, because it's in fucking portrait mode.  But he knows.  Stupid bastards.  You know what you're standing on. 
[01:18:00]  He doesn't care.  Yeah, but like I said, it could have been any piece of fabric that he was standing on.  I don't think he's doing it on purpose, because I don't think he even gives a shit  enough to do it on purpose.  Exactly.  He's just like, hey, it's there.  It's behind me.  Now it's not.  And I still have to do my shit.  If I'm stepping on it, I don't even know I'm stepping on it.  Right.  But that in itself is disrespectful.  It's disrespectful.  Right, right, right.  Right.  I don't know.  Yes.  And they're all looking at him walking on the flag that represents the country that's  paying every dime of their fucking food and shelter and everything else.  These fucking leeches. 
[01:18:30]  Leeches!  But he's not a dumb guy.  No.  He knows he's walking all over that flag.  I don't think he does.  And I don't think he's looking at it like just a set decoration.  You're definitely aware when American flags are around you.  Not him.  And not these people.  I don't think they give a shit.  Well, how about this?  Instead of all the fucking everyone crying about him stepping on the flag, if people really  care about the country and what it stands for, how about the next time somebody gets  in trouble for saying something unpopular, all you people out there listening, how about  you, I don't mean our fans necessarily, but how about you people defend somebody who 
[01:19:00]  says something shitty that you disagree with?  Right.  How about that?  All the fake patriots out there crying about the flag being stepped on, which is really  a piece of cloth.  But what it symbolizes, nobody fucking sticks up for anymore.  Exactly.  That's it.  Ah, the flag!  Get off the flag!  Meanwhile, somebody's fired for saying a racial joke.  Right.  God, he should be fired!  That was rude!  Of course.  Where's, where's, what it symbolizes?  Complete hypocrisy.  It is complete hypocrisy.  And by the way, I'm looking at the video again, at one point he looks right down at  the flag as he's walking. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, I mean.  He doesn't look at it like somebody who respects the flag would look at it.  No.  So he's just, he's looking at it, he's aware he's on it, but I don't think he cares about  any, you know.  Right.  What that means?  Yeah.  He's not doing it to be shocking.  He doesn't even realize.  He doesn't even realize.  It's nothing to him.  But the same people upset about this that'll be on the news complaining about it are the same  ones that would, would call somebody to task for an inappropriate tweet are the same, you  know what I mean?  It's like they, they cry about the symbol, but they fucking never stand up for what it's 
[01:20:00]  supposed to symbolize.  It drives me nuts.  Yeah, the threads are more important to those people than what, what it symbolizes.  Right.  The symbolizing of the American flag, they'll throw away every right and every other fucking  freedom that we have, but don't fuck up the white stripe with your footprint and the  threads that hold the stars on it and things like that.  It's, it really is a, it's a dumb thing.  They don't realize what they're defending.  That's what drives me crazy.  Yeah.  And I don't like stomping the American flag. 
[01:20:30]  I think it's, first of all, it's probably the hackiest anti-government thing you could  do.  Whoa, look, he's burning a flag.  Whoa.  Like, really?  I personally, yeah.  I wouldn't do it and, you know, I don't like when people do it, but it's like, it really,  it doesn't, to me, it doesn't change one ounce of how I feel about the country or how I feel  about veterans or soldiers.  None of that, my thinking is affected by somebody making, if they make an anti-government statement.  No consideration was taken from when they even planned this to have the flag treated 
[01:21:00]  respectfully.  Right.  And that's, that's the biggest problem.  Not him trotting upon it, because he doesn't even, that could be a fucking white sheet that  was up there and he would have looked at it the same way, stepped on it the same way.  We got to go to this guy.  He's in the army there.  He's in the army now.  John, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,  what branch are you in?  I'm in the army national guard right now.  I used to be a active air force.  Okay.  And my view on this, there, there shouldn't be any argument.  It's the dude's first amendment right. 
[01:21:30]  And in my opinion, and this goes with, and we'll love this because it goes with gun control.  It goes with everything.  In my opinion, the most important right for me to stand up for is the one that I most vehemently  disagree with, because if I can't stand up for your rights, whether I agree with them  or not, I can't expect anybody to stand up for mine.  And that's what, that's what pisses me off.  So many people sit there and want to silence somebody.  You know, okay, so maybe he's going to lose some record sales. 
[01:22:00]  Big deal.  Don't make an excuse for what you did.  Stand up for your damn self.  Well, uh, the people will, uh, like you said, they want their rights respected, um, with  having no respect for other people's rights.  Exactly.  They'll silence someone.  If, if there's something somebody saying offends them, they want them fired.  They want them silenced.  Yet they'll turn around and preach about what rights we have and how free we are in this  country.  And they're a bunch of hypocritical fuckwads. 
[01:22:30]  That's why this little Wayne thing.  Thank you for that call.  I mean, it's like you're somebody in the military saying that.  That doesn't bother me at all.  Thank you, sir.  We got to go on to this guy.  Uh, Jim, go ahead.  I'm right here.  Hey, uh, veteran of the military, proud American.  Uh, but I kind of disagree with you there, Jimmy.  Okay.  Because, uh, you have the freedom of speech means that you can say whatever you want.  You're not going to get arrested.  You go in many other countries and you say things, you're going to be torn in a jail.  Yes.  Now, if somebody has the right, you have the freedom of speech, but you also have the freedom 
[01:23:00]  to, everybody else has the freedom to take responsibility.  And, uh, and take action on that also.  But let me ask you a question, Jim.  Jim, hold on.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm going to let you finish.  I just wanted to discuss it with you.  People say take responsibility.  It's like I personally would never want you or anybody else penalized for expressing something  like whatever it was.  I mean, again, if you're making people riot, that's one thing.  But free speech is not just about getting arrested.  And you know that.  When you ask the average American free speech, I know what the Constitution says, but we 
[01:23:30]  think of free speech as the ability to say and express ourselves without penalty.  It's not prosecution, it's persecution.  So you don't necessarily have to be thrown in jail for it.  But persecution for your ideology and what you're saying can include being fired, having  your livelihood, your house taken away, being shunned.  Things like that are also included.  It's not just being arrested.  Well, you can say that.  You can say whatever you want.  You can say, you know, say an off-color joke and do it. 
[01:24:00]  But you've got to take the responsibility that comes with it.  Now, if it's not an acceptable thing by a majority of the people, you know, you're not  going to get thrown in jail, but you may lose your job for it.  Okay.  But you might be able to find another group that enjoys it, and they'll hire you.  But that's the idea.  That's the idea.  That's the beauty of a revolutionary.  But I'm saying...  It's how the world is running right now.  Jim, Jim, one thing at a time...  We just wish people would stand up and protect, you know, especially creative people more. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  You're saying, like, if the majority of people don't like it, then you'll be fired.  Well, that's kind of the problem I have with it.  Like, and again, if it's something that...  If you're in a company meeting and you stand up and go, too jiggable, you're going to get  fired.  I understand...  I'm from Anthony Incorporated.  But I mean, I'm not an idiot.  And I know you're right about that.  But I mean, whatever the flavor of the day is, offense-wise, is costing people their livelihood 
[01:25:00]  or their job.  So, basically...  You're defending your industry.  Now, let's say...  All industries.  No, Jim.  All industries.  Not just mine.  I'm not just defending mine.  Let's look at it this way, though.  Let's say that you came up with a product that nobody wants.  And so that company goes out of business because nobody wants to buy it.  Does that person have the right to still have a company that's selling something they want?  No, there's not a right to...  Jim, you just...  You just...  Thank you for saying that.  Oh.  If you make a product and nobody wants it, you go out of business. 
[01:25:30]  That is what the free market dictates.  If you're on...  Let's say you're on TV or whatever you're on and nobody watches you because you're not  good or you're not entertaining, the free market will dictate that the advertisers will  leave because you're not bringing in the viewers to put eyes on their products.  The problem is that when people are watching and somebody who just doesn't like what you're  saying goes behind your back and threatens the advertisers and says, because you're supporting 
[01:26:00]  statements we don't like by advertising, we will hurt your product.  That's not the free market at work.  So that you just...  That's special interest groups dictating what...  People are getting involved that way.  No, that's a special interest group dictating what the majority of the people should or shouldn't  hear.  And that happens much too much in our business anyway.  I'm just saying...  I understand what you're saying.  Like, you have the right to say it, but other people have the right to criticize it.  Sure.  And there are consequences to everything you say. 
[01:26:30]  Those consequences shouldn't be what amounts to mob tactics of blackmail and threatening your  job and your family's livelihood because somebody disagrees with what you're saying.  It's more like a witch hunt.  It's a mob rules with pitchforks and torches instead of how this is supposed to work.  Offensive speech is protected.  It's offensive.  That's why it needs to be protected.  Everybody says that.  Nice, pleasant speech doesn't need protection.  Right. 
[01:27:00]  It's easy.  Yeah.  And there shouldn't be this blackmail.  And it is blackmail.  That you...  Don't you fucking say this or you will lose your job.  Oh, you have the freedom to say it, but watch what we do if you do say it.  That's not true freedom.  And there should be no penalty.  There's no freedom there.  There's no freedom there.  None.  And then there's no freedom there.  There should be no penalty.  You're not going...  You're not being thrown into the gulag or anything.  Jim, we acknowledge that.  It's not about...  It's not about prosecution.  Right.  It's not about prosecution.  But that's...  But that's what the Constitution protects.  No, it's persecution. 
[01:27:30]  You were to come here to this country that is free.  Free from persecution.  Not prosecution.  Persecution for your ideology, for what you want to say, religious freedoms, things like that.  Persecution doesn't mean you're fucking going to be arrested.  It means you're going to be shunned.  You're going to not be able to work.  You're going to be an outcast.  You're going to have penalties, besides just being arrested, on what you say.  And you're supposed to have the freedom to say those things without persecution. 
[01:28:00]  Well, you have persecution.  I mean, Jimmy, a few weeks ago, going off on Catholic Church, I mean, he was persecuting them.  Is that right?  No, I wasn't.  I'll tell you why.  No, I wasn't.  No.  You're just playing some out.  I wasn't persecuting them.  I was offering an opinion about them.  Yeah, someone's opinion.  There's no consequence to what Jimmy is saying about the Catholic Church.  He's not rallying troops to do this, that, or the other thing.  He's not trying to take away any rights.  He's just offering his rebuttal, his opinion, to what their ideology is. 
[01:28:30]  There's a difference between doing that and actively going to somebody's job, their advertisers,  their bosses, and trying to relieve them of their income.  Yeah.  Well, you can agree or disagree on that, but let's just agree on it.  Yeah, because Jim...  Wow.  I love it.  Why would you want there to be a... 
[01:29:00]  Like, when you say people have to take responsibility for this...  I should just blow up balloons with this air that's coming out of my face.  I should just blow up balloons all day.  We never change anyone's mind.  I know.  They never change ours.  I know.  But there should be no penalty for...  Like, you talk about the Constitution.  Yeah.  If you're yelling fire at a movie theater, what are the provisions or whatever, you know,  time, place, the matter?  I get a movie at a firehouse.  Oh, Anthony.  Hilarious.  They laugh, slide down the pole.  But, like, we're discussing this.  Okay, that's what should happen if you say something or you express yourself.  Artistically, in a way.  People should discuss it. 
[01:29:30]  Do we agree?  Do we not agree?  How do we feel about it?  Okay, it sparks a discussion.  But there shouldn't be a penalty for you doing that if you're not, again, causing people  to riot or if you're not libeling somebody.  There should be no penalty for it.  That, to me, is what true freedom of speech is.  Exactly.  What should Lil Wayne's penalty be?  Nothing, obviously.  No, no.  People don't like his stuff?  Don't buy it.  This might influence people not to buy his new stuff.  Or more people might buy his shit because of what he did.  If you decide because of that you're not going to buy his stuff, don't then take it to the 
[01:30:00]  next level where you have to try to have it removed from iTunes, you're trying to take  away any sponsorships or endorsements he might have.  That isn't what freedom of speech is about.  Not buying his product, voicing your opinion about how you feel, that's freedom.  And that's the main point here.  We've seen a lot of great radio shows get fired over them following the rules.  They never got the chance to see what happened because they said something controversial on 
[01:30:30]  their radio show.  That's what we're trying to say here today.  If you say something controversial, it could affect your product, which is your radio show.  But we saw all these guys not even get that chance.  They got fired way before that.  Like if they're doing the Asian accents and the Asian jokes, they get fired for that even  though it's not against FCC regulations.  How it should play out is you allow the show to continue and then see if it fucking hurt  the ratings.  Yeah.  Yes.  But everyone gets so fucking scared.  They're like, oh, we got to get rid of that show immediately. 
[01:31:00]  And that's what we're trying to defend here today.  We know the radio world.  But now we're also seeing that it's going into a lot of other areas.  Sports, fucking business.  Right.  Just everything.  If someone says something outrageous on ESPN, that guy should not be fucking fired.  No.  But then they should play it out.  And now if because he's an asshole and he said some shitty things, obviously less people  are watching that particular ESPN show, then so be it.  Then that's the free market at work. 
[01:31:30]  Miss Universe or Miss America pageant contestants is asked a question.  She answers it honestly.  It's racially controversial, but there's nothing wrong with her opinion on it.  And then they attack her and want her thrown out of the competition.  Right.  Right.  It's like, that's freedom.  That's the mentality.  That's bordering on how the mob extorts people.  They don't allow it to play out.  That's the big point here today.  Yeah.  So, Jim, do you think that's a fair penalty? 
[01:32:00]  Like, if someone is asked an opinion like that, like Miss America or whoever it was  in Perez Hilton asked her that question about gay marriage.  And again, she expressed an opinion I don't agree with.  Right.  But then, you know, the amount of shit she took for her, people wanted her penalized  for it, like, for answering an honest question.  They basically wanted her life to be over.  That's crazy.  Nobody has a right to threaten, but they can make their statement and say that they disagree  with.  Right.  I agree with all that.  That's what's wrong with that.  But then, oh, throw her out of the contest. 
[01:32:30]  Why?  When you have access to something that the average person doesn't, their microphone is  very powerful.  They're speaking to millions of people.  No.  Don't buy that.  I don't buy that.  Same wattage.  It's pretty cheap, actually.  It's cheapy.  Wait.  Do I get more votes then?  I guess not.  I don't...  I have more influence, though, you see.  I don't believe that.  You have more influence than the person on the street.  But, Jim, here's the thing.  I don't believe in the fact that my influence makes people do anything.  I think for myself.  Well, then you're naive, then. 
[01:33:00]  No, I'm not naive.  I'm an American who thinks for himself.  And your right to free speech isn't based on how many people you're talking to at any  given moment, sir.  And I'm not abusing that and telling people to go out and riot.  And, by the way, I have not been able to influence your opinion, so why do you think  that arrogantly you're so much smarter than every other American listening?  No, no.  See, now you're making assumptions and making...  Don't cause a riot!  Have I changed who you are at all, Jim?  Seriously.  Jim.  You listen to the show.  You know who I am.  And I'm not saying that there's... 
[01:33:30]  I'm saying that when I disagree with you, that your connotation that there is no freedom  of speech because of the ramifications of what you've said, you say something, you've  got to take responsibility for the actions that could occur from that.  And be that, you know, you lose sponsors or because of people don't agree.  So people have the right to respond to what you say, too. 
[01:34:00]  Well, I'll say it again.  It never gets to that point.  There's a buffer in there that is getting rid of all these fucking people before you see  what the free market is going to do to that show.  The people that own the company and run the station has a responsibility to other people  and they can't...  If they feel that they know that...  They don't know.  That's our whole point today.  They don't know.  They're scared shitless of anything controversial.  So their reaction is to get rid of the fucking show immediately. 
[01:34:30]  And then you don't have true freedom of speech.  And that's not freedom of speech whatsoever.  No.  The corporations are dictating this whole fucking thing now.  It has nothing to do with freedom of speech anymore.  What can't you say?  Well, we're lucky because we're on satellite radio.  We're very lucky, yeah.  We're talking about...  We were in the regular radio world and we watched it fucking burn to the ground.  It's a shitty, shitty business now, regular radio.  What can't you say if you're Rush Limbaugh?  I mean, you can say it.  And again, you don't go to jail.  But man, criticize that woman. 
[01:35:00]  Offer a strong opinion about that woman.  I forget the woman's name.  Oh, that fucking birth control.  Yes.  Right, right.  Offer a strong opinion.  They wanted Rush's job.  They wanted his job.  He survived.  People went for his job because they hate him so much.  Right.  They're like, ah, got him.  We got him.  Right.  So, yeah, there you go right there.  He happened to skate because he's so big and he's kind of his own boss.  But he had to come out and apologize when you know he wasn't sorry.  He was sort of lucky.  That was scary for a while there. 
[01:35:30]  But he does have a lot of power on the other side, you know?  Sure he does.  Sure he does.  But I mean, as much as we bitch about being on satellite radio with this company, trust  me, we're fully aware that we're lucky and we get away with a lot more than these guys  on ESPN and these guys on regular radio and, you know.  Well, as I said at the beginning, you know, I'm a veteran.  I lived overseas in foreign countries.  And trust me, we have much more freedoms.  Sure.  No one's doubting that.  Hold on.  Let's start with the whole Lil Wayne thing. 
[01:36:00]  So what do you think should happen to Lil Wayne?  For a stop?  Let's say he purposely stomped on the flag.  I personally will vote against him by never buying any album.  Okay.  Okay.  That's what should happen.  That's exactly what should happen.  Yeah.  That's right.  There it is.  That to me is fair.  But there's also people and a lot of people out there that feel strongly that he should  never be able to record another song again because of what he did.  Yeah.  And would you go out of your way and tell other people, don't buy this.  Don't buy this.  Or would you just exercise your free choice and go, I'd choose not to buy this. 
[01:36:30]  And let other people exercise this.  I don't mind that he pushes other people not to buy it, by the way, because that's, you  know.  I don't understand.  I have the right to tell my circle of friends, though, and say, hey, did you see what that  clown did?  You honestly do.  But to me, personally, of course you have that right.  But personally, I don't have that desire to encourage other people to purchase or not  purchase an artist's work because I don't agree with the state.  I don't care if you do. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Like, I don't want to hurt them professionally.  But yeah, telling your friends is one thing.  But just, I'm talking about starting an act of boycott.  Which never happens.  It never gets to that point.  It never gets to a boycott.  Yeah.  People never do anything.  No.  Like, down on the boy's cot?  Yeah.  Lay down.  Put your head on the pillow.  Kiss where the drool is.  Look.  You feel strongly that the Atlanta guy should not have been fired.  Yeah.  Even though it was a very tasteless bit.  It's a tasteless bit. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  You know, they should have been more aware that the world just doesn't play anymore.  But...  I haven't heard Chipper's view on this whole thing.  All right.  What's that?  I haven't heard Chipper's view on this whole thing.  I believe that freedom is...  Like, you know, fire in a movie theater all the time.  And you go, what are you talking about?  I go, I'm firing somebody because I'm the boss.  There you go.  Jesus.  Oh, boys.  Good job.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jim.  Good discussion.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice.  I feel great that we changed his mind completely on that. 
[01:38:00]  But I mean, that's the thing.  That's why I don't believe this whole we have more influence thing.  I just think for myself.  And I give all the audience the credit for thinking for themselves.  Yeah.  Think for yourself.  Jim's the same guy he was before he called.  Uh-huh.  An asshole.  We're watching this happen with Facebook postings and tweets.  So it is hitting the average Joe.  It really is.  People are losing their jobs.  You've got employers now that are looking at your fucking Facebook pages and your Twitter accounts.  And they're making some strong opinions about you and decisions on your livelihood. 
[01:38:30]  They want your passwords, too.  A lot of these companies that are hiring you, you have to sign when you get hired that, yes, here's my password for my Facebook, my Twitter.  And they have access to that and can look at your private messages and everything else.  They want to know.  And if you have a strong opinion on something, that shouldn't affect your fucking job.  Absolutely should not.  Absolutely.  Unless that opinion has something to do with what you do for a living, maybe.  Maybe.  But they don't even look at...  It's not even close to that. 
[01:39:00]  Especially things like opinion.  Opinion is so...  It's given too much fucking power in this country where you voice your opinion and all of a sudden people think it's this new law that's been laid out.  And they must adhere to it.  And it's affecting them.  It's like, no, this is my belief.  I am completely allowed to spew my fucking belief without having this threat over my head.  We're experts at radio and what has happened to radio fucking shows. 
[01:39:30]  Yes.  And there is a point in there that's really important.  It never gets to the point where you see what the controversy is going to do to the radio show.  It's never like, well, we kept him on a year after he said that and boy, we're broke.  Look what happened.  It never happened.  It doesn't even come close to that.  They're like, fire everybody.  Instead of saying, well, we hired this edgy show.  They did something edgy.  They didn't break any FCC regulations.  But, you know, they got to go.  How's Cowhead doing?  Didn't he say something?  He's surviving.  He's surviving. 
[01:40:00]  And he survived.  And that's a company that said, you know what?  We're going to buy our guy.  And we were wrong about him, by the way.  Oh, man.  I thought he was gone.  Because we said fired, so fired.  So fired.  But he's working for a company that said, look, we'll see what happens, you know?  All right.  So let's say the cowhead thing was over the retard picture or I forgot exactly.  Right.  So now he survived that.  And now, you know, the free market fucking society is going to decide if they want to  continue listening to that type of radio show.  And I guess they are.  He at least gets that chance. 
[01:40:30]  Most radio shows do not get that chance.  I heard you say retard and he got right on mic.  What happened?  It's not nice.  I know.  He didn't lose any sponsors or anything.  No.  Probably wasn't said on air and whatever, but whatever.  He should stay.  He didn't do anything.  It's like.  Yeah.  But in this world we live in, I'm surprised that he didn't lose sponsors and all that.  Good for him.  That's a good radio company who's stuck with a talented guy and that's how it should be.  He does a good job for them.  And you know what?  These Atlantic guys, let's just say that they did.  Hey, you know what we did was fucking brutal.  Once in a while, if you say you're sorry, if you mean it, I don't say no one should ever 
[01:41:00]  apologize if they feel it.  If the company goes like, look, this is kind of disastrous what you said.  It's terrible.  And if they think about it and go, yeah, that was a little rough, that one line.  Can I stop you for a second?  What's disastrous about it in the end?  Meaning if they say like.  You know, they hurt some families, you know, because they're dealing with that and that sucks.  But what was really disastrous about it?  They may feel that was like, they may, sometimes you say something.  As a person, I've said things I regretted, like, that was too harsh.  You know, I'm a guy like everybody else.  So maybe you feel like you say something like, fuck, that line about smothering was a little 
[01:41:30]  rough.  We were just doing it.  I understand that.  But was it disastrous for the masses?  No.  Of course not.  They may feel, maybe disastrous wasn't the right word.  Maybe they feel it was, ah, that was one we shouldn't have said.  If they didn't get in trouble, I'm certain when they fucking left the show that day and  went out on the street, they probably went like, that was rough.  Because I've done the same thing here.  You pile on when you're here.  It's like a feeding frenzy.  And then you see that goddamn sun and you're like, ah.  Yeah.  You walk out that door and you're like, oh God, I'm an awful person.  I think Bill Burr said it right. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, Bill Burr.  Perfectly one day.  Yeah, yeah.  You feel like shit as soon as you leave and realize it's a beautiful sunny day.  Like, what did I do up there?  I've walked out with Bill and literally the door opens, we walk out, it closes, he runs  his hand through his hair and he looks at me and he goes, Jesus, what the fuck was I  saying?  What an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm just laughing like, yeah, I hear you.  Because we're heading toward a society where you're not going to, we've said it a million  times, no one's going to give their opinion.  No.  There's too much risk. 
[01:42:30]  Yep.  Too much risk.  Training each other to lie.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the opinions are there, people just bury them.  You're already seeing it.  That's just it.  It's this big cover up.  It's not, no one's fixing anything, no one's changing anyone's opinions, but we put this  big cover over it hoping that if we don't see it, that people aren't feeling that way  or thinking those things.  The truth of the matter is, they are.  And there's no amount of fucking putting covers on it that's going to stop it.  And it all goes back to nappy-headed hoe.  When I saw radio shows not supporting Imus, you don't have to be happy about what he said, 
[01:43:00]  but you've got to support his right to say it.  I was amazed.  I'm like, you idiots, that's going to affect what you do every day on your radio show.  You're a broadcaster, you dummy.  How the fuck are you giving this guy shit and saying he should be fired?  You're in the same business, and the same exact thing could happen to you, whether you  think so or not.  It might not be saying something like nappy-headed hoe, but it could be saying something else 
[01:43:30]  about a whole other topic that's going to get you in trouble.  It should have been allowed to play out, but that fucking asshole Al Sharpton and the  rest of them, it should have played out.  What happened?  Al Sharlatan.  Right.  I know what he used to call him that.  What happens to an Imus after he says nappy-headed hoe?  He should have been able to continue on MSNBC.  Where was he at the time?  NBC?  I forget now.  I think it was on...  Oh, the fan.  The fan, right?  Yeah, it was on the fan.  It was on the fan.  It should have been allowed to play out, and then his listeners should have been able 
[01:44:00]  to decide if they wanted to continue to listen to the guy that said nappy-headed hoe.  Period.  Our point, it never gets to that.  They fire you immediately.  He had to dress up like an old woman to get another job.  And it turns out he did just fine.  No one gave a shit in the end.  Yeah, he came back, and there's no problem.  None.  Amazing.  Fucking ace-holes.  Somebody did raise a good point, though, on Twitter, which is rare.  Oh.  He says, uh...  You have changed how people feel with your freedom of speech. 
[01:44:30]  Just look at all the straight men you've turned into tranny lovers.  Valid point.  That's a valid point.  All right, fair enough.  I just personally think for myself the way I...  I just don't want anybody to get in trouble for what they say.  Exactly.  And I kind of expect the same courtesy.  It's like, it's real simple.  Right.  I don't need to create a reason why my opinion is more valid than yours.  You should be able to say what you want.  But people get confused.  If they don't like what somebody said, then they're like, oh, get rid of that fucking guy. 
[01:45:00]  And people are ignorant as to what their rights are in this country, too.  Right.  They honestly think all of their rights are these rights to their own convenience and comfortability,  which is absolutely untrue.  The basic reason for these rights is so people can be uncomfortable and not come after you  because of your ideas.  You have the right to be offended.  Yes.  But people absolutely think if you offend them that you've committed some type of crime, 
[01:45:30]  sometimes even legally, or some type of you're infringing on their right.  But they don't have a right to not be offended.  And then if you support what Lil Wayne did, they think, oh, you're four people stomping on the...  No!  I fucking hate what he did.  But you've got to support his right to do that.  Yeah.  It really is as simple as that in America.  Desecration of the flag has been protected many times.  It's gone before the courts. 
[01:46:00]  Who would fight that?  I know.  It's just a protected thing.  It's a fucking piece of cloth.  You're able to do that.  You're allowed to do it.  Like I said, it's hacky.  I don't...  I don't know.  If you want to voice your discontent with the country, I think there's better ways to say it than burning a flag or stepping on a flag.  Let's go to Andy in Jersey.  Andy.  Andy!  Listen, I think where it comes down to it is, you know, a lot of people who get fired who are employees, they sign up knowing what the ethics of the company are. 
[01:46:30]  So you get a guy who basically, they tell you that, you know, you're going to respect others, do whatever, and if you're in the public area, and then you say something off-color or derogatory to someone, the company has the right to fire you.  But we're not...  You're right.  Legally, you're right, yes.  We know that, legally, yeah.  Yeah, you can't walk around and be an asshole at work.  But we're talking about, now you do your job perfectly, you're great at your job, then you go home and you have a strong opinion about maybe some race issue, and you write something on Facebook, next thing you know, the company sees that and goes, 
[01:47:00]  Oh, we can't have this guy.  Even though it had nothing to do with the job you're doing.  All right, I'm with you on that.  I thought if you're going down the road with the guy who made the ass call on his phone, you know, and he ends up talking about the guy who just delivered pizza to him and gets fired, I think that's, you know, that's kind of work.  That's fireable, dude.  Yeah, that's fireable.  Yeah, we're not...  He said that to the guy's answering machine, a customer's answering machine.  We're not unreasonable.  We get it to a point.  We understand also that the workplace is not a fucking democracy. 
[01:47:30]  Right, right.  When you're walking around the halls at work, you can't just start, you know, get on a soapbox and start bad-mouthing the boss.  You're going to get your ass thrown out of there.  You've got to present yourself appropriately.  We get it.  We're not talking about that shit.  I'm with you then, boys.  All right.  Thank you, brother.  And you know what?  The company can make up rules and regulations as to how you're supposed to act in the workplace, and you have to adhere to those regardless of your constitutional.  That's what we signed up for a long time ago. 
[01:48:00]  It's like, okay, do whatever you want.  Here's the FCC regulations.  I forgot how many rules there were.  Study this shit.  And that's it.  There was a time that's all you had to worry about.  You could do all the Asian fucking accents you want.  You could do your Lou Gehrig disease jokes all the fuck you want, as long as you follow those particular FCC rules.  And you fast forward a bunch of years, and wow, it's a completely different fucking ballgame.  Everyone's very sensitive.  You don't even know what you're going to get fired for. 
[01:48:30]  It changes all the time.  Back in the day, you knew what you were going to get fired for.  If you said fuck on the air, there's a good chance, unless you had really good ratings, they were going to fire you.  We could have said something today we don't even know that's going to get us fired.  We have no fucking idea.  It changes.  Whoever's got the loudest voice at the moment, that's all it is.  Right.  Yeah.  And we are training each other to lie.  Like Anthony Weiner and all these politicians, why do they lie?  People deserve what you get.  And this is why.  You're right.  That guy called up the companies that make you sign these things. 
[01:49:00]  That's disgusting that you have to give your Facebook password.  Yeah.  But if companies knew that the country as a whole would never stand for that type of bullshit, companies wouldn't do it.  But they do it because they know they can.  And why can they?  Because nobody defends each other.  That's with everything.  And the government itself does that to people.  Yeah.  And we don't defend each other.  And the guy requesting your password, he's a complete asshole when he's not working.  Oh, please.  Sure.  He's not better than the employees.  Fucking putting on dresses and fucking parading around the neighborhood. 
[01:49:30]  Coming to my house.  Yes.  But all the people who cry about the flag burning and the flag stomping, defend what the flag is supposed to stand for.  Not the dopey symbolism.  Yeah, yeah.  And fight for someone's right to say something that you don't like.  And it sounds corny, but we do it all the time.  I didn't fucking like half the things that we've defended speech-wise.  Oh, God, no.  We should get a list.  I'll tell you the ones I fucking hated.  I want to fight for my right to party. 
[01:50:00]  Party.  Party and party and party and party and.  Yes, exactly.  Fighting for the right.  Is there anybody that disagrees with us on the phone?  I mean, I'm sure there are.  Oh, boy.  That's fine, too, I guess.  I mean.  We'll give them a little lesson.  Who wants a lesson?  Oh, yeah.  Give you a fucking lesson.  Officer, why don't you put someone through for a life lesson?  Yeah.  Give them a life lesson.  Who wants some?  Yeah.  Come on, Officer.  Put through someone for a life lesson.  Come and get it.  All right.  I'll just read the phone calls. 
[01:50:30]  I like just reading them sometimes.  You can do whatever you want to do.  That's what the country's about.  Oh, Paul from Illinois is a.  All right.  We'll get to that.  That's going to be a problem.  Free speech is a lot deeper than what you're making it.  What?  I want to talk to Jimmy about the influence they have with the mic.  Mike?  Jimmy is wrong.  It's not just a piece of cloth.  People die and fight for it.  No, they don't.  They fight for what's behind it.  Right.  They fight for what it means.  The principles of the flag.  They fight for what it means. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  And what it means, we the country don't respect.  Yeah, we don't even make our flags in America.  Yeah, that's kind of funny.  Are they really not made in America?  No.  There are some that are and some, there's some companies that have popped up because  they're, they're like, what the fuck?  We don't even make American flags in this country.  But in most cases, no, you'll see made in Taiwan, made in China.  To the guy saying that, like, I know.  I'll talk to him.  Okay.  Hello, sir.  Paul.  Yes.  Hi, Paul.  Hey, buddy.  Hello, Jerry. 
[01:51:30]  Can I, can I say like, I, can I say, can I say, I know what you mean, buddy?  Like, like, there's a, it's a terrible example, but there's a, Stephen King wrote a book  called Pet Sematary.  I mean, I mean, uh, Salem's Lot.  And there's a great scene in there where the priest and the vampire are facing off.  And the priest is holding the cross and it's glowing strong.  And the vampire says to him, throw the cross away and face me, my faith against your faith.  And the priest won't do it.  And of course, the cross fades away and the vampire crunches it and throws it and said, 
[01:52:00]  you've forgotten the tenets of your own religion.  It's not the cross.  That's just wood or plastic.  It's the faith behind it.  But that's what, had you thrown the cross away, you would have beaten me.  And again, that's a terrible example.  But the flag's an important symbol, but people are not honoring what it's supposed to stand  for.  And that's what's driving me crazy.  And that's why I'm saying it's a piece of cloth.  Because people are not fighting for each other's rights in daily life to say unpopular things  or to, you know, we don't even want gay people to get married half. 
[01:52:30]  But like, we have this thing where we protect only ourselves and we don't give a fuck about  the next guy.  But if you burn a flag, we cry about how you're violating everyone's patriotism.  Yeah.  Well, I don't want the queers getting married either, but that's a different story.  Oh, Paul.  Jesus.  Well, what I was going to say was, and it's exactly, you know, you're right up the hill  and you're shooting the bullets are coming at you.  It's a different story.  If you were to go down to the Fort McKinley, like I did last year, 200 year anniversary 
[01:53:00]  of the War of 1812, and Francis Scott, he, you know, wrote the Star-Spangled Banner down  there, you would have realized that, okay, yeah, this is more than just a piece of cloth.  At least, you know, as far as in the moment, yeah, I was served in the military, I had  bullets shot at me, and standing at Fort McKinley where the Star-Spangled Banner was  written, I really felt like, okay, this is more than that.  That's all I wanted to say.  No, but I don't even disagree with that, Paul. 
[01:53:30]  Saying it's a piece of cloth is not the way I view the flag as a whole.  Right.  I'm talking about when the outrage over something like this happens, there's so many parts that  the flag is supposed to represent that the fucking public doesn't give a shit about,  where that people constantly allow what the flag is supposed to stand for to be destroyed  or trampled or ignored, but then when this happens, they come out of the woodwork and  cry patriotism.  Isn't it Fort McKinley?  Oh, I understand that, but also, what you like to say, back in the day, one of the hippie 
[01:54:00]  people, back in the 70s, ran out in the center field when the Dodgers were playing, and Rick  Mundy came out there and tackled him because the guy was trying to burn the flag.  Sure.  Yeah, that's how I feel about it.  I would have tackled that guy and beat the crap out of him.  You know what?  And I probably would have been happy you did it.  Yeah, of course.  I probably would have been happy you did it because the guy is a douchebag.  And I think exercising your right is, that's not exercising your right if you run onto a  baseball field with lighter fluid. 
[01:54:30]  No, not really.  You know what I mean?  There's a lot of reasons that's wrong to do.  It's not exercising your, I can't, I'm for gay marriage.  I can't run across the outfield Yankee Stadium with a sign with two men kissing and write  Yahoo, goody-goody on it.  Yippee.  Oh, one more thing.  I want to say, Opie, the past two months, the show has been awesome, and I have to give  you credit as well, Jimmy and Anthony, the show's been fantastic.  All right?  I can't say enough about it.  All right, thank you.  We're trying. 
[01:55:00]  And it's McHenry, not McKinley.  You sound silly when you say Fort McKinley.  Thank you, sir.  You sound silly when you say Fort McKinley.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  He's nervous.  Bye, Paul.  That's an interesting point.  So, yeah, the guy running on the field to burn the flag.  Yeah.  I mean, I think there is a little gray area there, too, because then you're like, yeah,  fucking tackle that guy and beat the shit out of him.  Yeah.  But it goes against everything we just said.  And I got to acknowledge that.  Yeah.  So there is, it feels like there's some wiggle room in a weird, you know what I'm trying 
[01:55:30]  to say?  Well, if you're in that situation where security can tune you up just for being there, it might  give you an extra little horn twist in for having the flag.  But as much as we're like saying, you know, he has the right to do that, we're also saying,  yeah, beat the shit out.  You know what?  We have to be fair and say that we agree with that.  Yeah, but I'd want him to have the shit beat out of me even if he had like the fucking  old Soviet flag.  Yeah.  I just like seeing people get the shit beat out of him when they run out on the field.  Yeah, exactly.  Nothing funnier than watching the security chase him and fucking grab him. 
[01:56:00]  But he got us in a corner there because, you know, that sort of goes against what we've  been saying here for the last hour.  Look at how awful the Westboro Baptist Church are.  And they're doing it totally legally.  Like, they are the most hated group in the country.  And I hate them.  But I would love to see them run over.  I would love to see them.  So what is that about?  Because it doesn't mean that we have to like somebody.  They're hateable.  You can have strong emotions to see them have horrible things happen to them.  I literally hope they're killed in a car accident.  I hope every one of them is in that van. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  And to no one's fault but God's, the tires blow out and they're trapped and they burn  alive.  Oh God, that would be terrible.  All of them.  Imagine that.  And we have it on video.  Very slow.  That we can laugh and jerk off to.  But they have the right to protest.  They absolutely do.  So the guy has the right to fucking run on the field even though it's illegal.  No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't have the right to run on the field.  No, they actually get permits and everything.  Okay, you're right.  But what he's doing on the field he has the right to do, right? 
[01:57:00]  If it wasn't on the field.  He technically doesn't have the right to run across the field and hold the flag up and  honor it either.  Right.  He doesn't have the right to do that.  So he's part of the property.  He's got a good beating.  Yeah.  You could want to see them burn alive like that but you can't go out there with fucking  spike strips, gasoline and a flare.  Sure.  And you know.  I wouldn't want anybody to hurt them because as much as they're hateable and they're just  unreasonable and they're pigs, there's something about them that's fantastic for  who we are as a country.  Right.  It's a great gauge to see how this country is supposed to work. 
[01:57:30]  I mean, you know, given any other country, if they were in there, you'd never see them  again.  No.  There's plenty of countries where you would never see them again.  Look, we got a guy who lost his leg in Afghanistan.  Agreed with Jimmy.  That's not what we're fighting for.  It's a piece of cloth.  Hello, sir.  You want to talk to him?  Sure.  Yo, Pete.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Thanks for your service.  Thank you for your service.  You're welcome.  And I'm probably not many guys would agree with how I feel right now but I agree with 
[01:58:00]  Jimmy because what are we fighting for now is just we're not fighting for that flag anymore.  We're fighting for Muslims to have better lives in their countries.  We're not fighting for Americans anymore.  We're fighting to keep peace everywhere else.  And what we created, that cloth that we created, means nothing anymore to a lot of Americans  because of that fact that we have to be the cleanup crew for every other goddamn third  world country.  It is ridiculous, ridiculous at this point. 
[01:58:30]  I can't stand that.  That's what gets me.  And Jimmy, you know what?  I want to start a flag company made in the USA because, you know, that is exactly, that  example itself is a huge statement that is powerful.  And if you say to anybody, you know, this flag, this American flag that we cherish and  we fight over and we yell at people about is made in another country because we're fucking  morons.  That answers every stupid question that has ever been asked to. 
[01:59:00]  A lot of Taiwan flags out there.  I mean, that's just how I'm feeling.  And I don't hate the country.  I don't, you know, I fought.  I paid my, you know, I got hurt.  It's opened my eyes up to a lot of things.  But this flag thing and what it's fighting for, it's media driven bullshit.  And it's just sad because there's too many young kids coming back, not even mangled, just  just brain dead.  You're fucked up. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, it's amazing.  Aren't you, dude, dude, aren't you fighting for the, like your buddy next to you pretty  much when you're in those situations?  It's what I hear from a lot of the veterans.  It's like, you know, they're not thinking about the flag, the country, the mission.  It's like me and the fucking buddies that are next to me.  Those are the guys that you're fighting for.  100%.  And the kid that's on trial that whacked out about 18 people, the families and kids, he  was mentally unstable, man.  And there's about 60% of us out here, or out there and here, that are living this life. 
[02:00:00]  And it's like, I don't know, I'm not on any drugs or anything, but I wish I was.  You know, it's just a tough thing to deal with.  It's just a tough thing to deal with.  People like covering that up, too.  You saw it after Vietnam.  There was a lot of people with mental problems after that, and it kind of caught up with  the country in the 70s and 80s and stuff.  I think you're going to see a lot more of that, too.  I don't think the help is out there for a lot of these guys.  What did they do?  What did they do back in the day? 
[02:00:30]  I remember it's almost like one flew over the cuckoo's nest.  What are we going to do?  Throw these guys, you know, put electrodes on their brain.  It's not going to work.  Or fill them up with all these drugs and all these pharmaceutical companies want to test on us  than a rat, you know?  Yeah.  It's a tough situation, but you make the best of it.  And I think about that one scene, and you've got to laugh about things in life.  I think about that one scene where Martini wants a cigarette.  I want more cigarettes.  Yeah.  I mean, just think about the fucking craziness that, how they used to treat guys like us 
[02:01:00]  when we got back from Vietnam.  No, it was Mr. Cheswick.  Was that Cheswick?  Cheswick.  It was Chesie.  What a great movie.  What a great movie.  I just wanted to throw it out there, Jimmy.  I love your work.  Thank you, buddy.  I love that you guys are now competing for podcasts.  You guys, I love it.  Let's jump into the podcast world.  I love it.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  And I want to clarify, too.  Like, I don't look at the flag as only a piece of cloth.  I don't think it has no meaning. 
[02:01:30]  I don't mean that.  I understand what it symbolizes, and I do understand it's an important symbol.  Yeah.  But my problem is when the outrage occurs, it's like the people who are outraged, where  the fuck you weren't fighting, or at least speaking up, and defending what it's supposed  to defend.  I'm not talking about this guy, of course, who's fucking lost a leg.  I mean the average American who's weighing in.  Yeah, yeah.  The symbolism becomes more important than the substance of what it's supposed to be.  They don't give a shit if people are in trouble for saying unpopular things. 
[02:02:00]  But boy, you stop the symbol, and they get upset.  Right.  There you go.  We should take a break.  All righty.  It's like my new book.  It's like my new book.  Craziness just gets crazier.  Um, okay.  You don't like my book title?  I don't think I'll be buying that one.  No.  I like boats down there.  Yeah, but boats dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,  down there.  I know it's a dot, dot, dot, dot.  Semi-colon boats down there.  Don't forget the O.P.N. Anthony podcast.  Every Wednesday, a brand new episode.  So the latest episode is ready for your downloading pleasure. 
[02:02:30]  You got Scott Thorson, the ex-lover of Liberace.  and we go old school.  We go way back.  Something we haven't played  on this channel  in a long, long time.  8-track porn.  And then the Opie and Anthony Nugget.  And people already know  what the Nugget is  because they're tweeting  what the Nugget is.  We threw Butt Plug on this week.  Oh.  Good old Butt Plug  from Demented World CD.  Butt Plug?  Yes.  Butt Plug.  Wow.  That's cool, man.  It's amazing.  It sounds just like you're the guy. 
[02:03:00]  The Butt Plug guy  is doing butt plug.  Holy fuck.  I'm looking at the guy.  Butt Plug.  Wow.  It sounds just like him, right?  Exactly.  That's amazing.  I downloaded that shit  from Napster.  That was a Napster download.  That's how old we are.  Oh, fuck.  It was labeled Adam Sandler.  That and Adam Sandler  were on my Napster queue.  Yeah, a lot of our fucking shit  that did real well  in the Napster days,  they labeled it as Adam Sandler.  Adam Sandler.  Yeah.  He got credit for a bunch  of our fucking bits 
[02:03:30]  because we were nobodies.  No one knew who the fuck we were.  These little nuggets  were out there  and they were doing very well  and they just labeled them  Adam Sandler bits.  So the days when  our stuff was on Napster  and Opie used to take a Napski.  A Napski.  A Napski.  Yes.  Wait.  Napster.  Opie was like,  I'm going to go home  and take a Napski.  You never said that.  Oh, fuck yeah, I did.  No.  I never heard Napski.  That might be before  the Jim Norton years.  You said I'm going to go home  and take a Napski?  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Napski.  I haven't done it  since the Jim Norton years.  A Napski?  Make up your mind.  You get a Napski.  That's a good one.  Two different things.  Am I right or wrong, people?  Wrong.  Give a fuck.  Yo, where's Mike Rowe?  Yeah, how about Mike Paddle?  Fox and Friends.  What's up with Mike Rowe  on Fox and Friends?  Yeah, with Mike Jumpin' Jack.  I sent a publicist's email  two days ago,  but I'll give her a call.  Two days ago.  So we'll rig that a hole  there, tanker.  And what's the problem  with Russell Brand?  Some are saying  because we trashed Arthur.  That was way before Arthur. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, he switched out publicists.  The publicists,  the Seth Rogen,  always brought him in.  And then once he left  to a different company.  Who's his company now?  I have to double check, though.  He's within two of them already.  Like, he switched  and switched again.  But who is it  that's keeping us?  Do they have other people  that we talk to?  I mean, it doesn't make sense to me.  We had good interviews  with the guy.  Yeah, I think the last time  you guys didn't want him at all.  Yeah, after Arthur,  since he did the other interview.  You said no.  No.  Yeah.  But there was no one  before that.  There might have been a point  that he wanted to then 
[02:05:00]  come back after blowing us off  for a couple of years.  That might have been it.  Maybe.  And then we're like,  fuck you.  Now you're coming.  I'm not sure, though.  Is that what you're saying?  It was a while ago, yeah.  We got blown off first.  Yeah, first.  For a while.  On a bunch of big projects he had.  Right.  Didn't he have a second book, even?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he blew us off for that.  And then he,  the movie book tour,  then movie.  And then he finally decided  to come back?  For that movie, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think it was  for getting to the Greek.  We were within our right 
[02:05:30]  at that point  to say, fuck you.  Where have you been?  So now it's, you know,  one for us, one for him.  So let's work this out.  That's what I did.  I sent an email this morning.  We are both butthurt,  and now we're gonna...  No, we're getting back  on the fucking show.  How did butthurt become something?  I know.  What does it even mean?  He's all butthurt.  Wizard creep.  I don't know.  We were both butthurt.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The guy got all butthurt. 
[02:06:00]  But we got some sov.  Some sov.  Some sov,  and we're moving on now.  It does sound...  I don't know why,  but butthurt works,  even though it's terrible.  I don't know why, but...  A lot of dumb ones out there.  Yeah, you don't fucking butthurt.  All right, the Utah broad.  She went on...  Yeah, okay.  I haven't heard this clip.  I hear it's kind of douchey, though.  What's that?  She went on the Today Show  with Matt Lauer  to answer the question properly.  Oh, yeah?  Remember the dummy?  So get the original clip,  and then we'll play  what you did on the Today Show.  And we'll make love. 
[02:06:30]  And we'll make some love.  Make love.  And Cher had a big comeback  on The Voice last night?  Oh, yeah.  I just saw Cher was over there on...  Is that in our wheelhouse?  Team Blake won.  Cher.  Is that show over now?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, maybe we'll play  the Cher thing from The Voice.  What the fuck?  Team Blake?  I don't know.  Let's go do a little  man-to-man comparing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  America.  America. 
[02:07:00]  America.  Fuck yeah.  Coming again to save  the motherfucking day.  America.  Fuck yeah.  Freedom is the only way.  Terrorists, your game is rude.  Because now you have to answer to.  America.  Fuck yeah.  Flick my butt  and surf on my own America.  Fuck yeah.  What you gonna do  when we come for you now? 
[02:07:30]  It's the dream that we all share.  It's the hope for tomorrow.  Fuck yeah.  Together.  Fuck yeah.  Walmart.  Fuck yeah.  The Gap.  Fuck yeah.  Baseball.  Fuck yeah.  NFL.  Fuck yeah.  Rock and roll.  Fuck yeah.  Internet.  Fuck yeah.  Slavery.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Starbuck.  Fuck yeah.  Disney World.  Fuck yeah.  Porno.  Fuck yeah.  Vallejo.  Fuck yeah.  Reebok.  Fuck yeah.  Faintits.  Fuck yeah.  Sushi.  Fuck yeah.  Taco Bell.  Fuck yeah.  Rodeo.  Fuck yeah.  The Bath and Beyond.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Liberty.  Fuck yeah.  Whiteslip.  Fuck yeah.  The Alamo.  Fuck yeah.  Band-Aids.  Fuck yeah.  Las Vegas.  Fuck yeah.  Christmas.  Fuck yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Immigrant.  Fuck yeah.  Popeye.  Fuck yeah.  Democrat.  Fuck yeah.  Republicans.  Fuck yeah.  Spooky shit.  Books.  The O.P.  Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[02:09:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The O.P.  and Anthony Show.  What a show.  What a show.  I'm telling you,  I always hated having an American flag around,  because I just always felt like there was way too much responsibility.  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden,  it would drag on the ground by accident, 
[02:09:30]  and then you're in a major panic.  Like, who saw that?  Yeah.  If someone puts one on the side of the house.  Yeah, all right.  No wind,  so it kind of scrapes on the ground a little bit.  Right, right, right.  Ah!  It was just too stressful.  That's all right.  I was just screaming.  What did you get, O.P.?  I got, well,  it looks kind of,  kind of,  you know.  What is that?  It's healthy, though.  It looks faggy.  No, it doesn't.  No, it looks delicious.  Yeah, cum would be more masculine.  Yeah, I didn't expect it to.  It's pink.  It's pink,  and it's foamy.  That's the strawberries. 
[02:10:00]  It's like some type of a shake.  It's a smoothie.  What's in it?  That looks good.  It's all, like,  boring shit.  It does look boring.  It's healthy peanut butter,  some fresh strawberries,  skim milk,  and low-fat yogurt.  Let me ask you now,  healthy peanut butter.  And a little banana.  What's healthy?  That looks good.  Fuck.  That's a lovely treat.  It looks like it should taste like  one of those fine,  friendly fribbles.  Yes, it's like pink fribble.  But instead,  it tastes like chalk. 
[02:10:30]  Does it?  Wait, what is the healthy peanut butter?  I just made that up.  Oh.  Oh, you just threw an adjective in there?  Yeah.  I guess they say  the fat in peanut butter  is the healthy kind.  A little bit, yeah.  But I would assume  Jiffy peanut butter  has a lot more sugar  than other fucking brands  of peanut butter.  So I guess  to answer your question,  it's like less sugar  in the peanut butter.  I do recall getting,  I used to get  the banana strawberry smoothies  back at the old XM.  And by the time I got home, 
[02:11:00]  oh my God.  Really?  It goes right through you?  Toilet city.  Yeah.  Yeah, sorry, bub.  Yep, yep, yep, yep.  Very nasty.  Oh my God.  That's pretty good, actually.  It tastes like  liquid peanut butter and jelly.  Does it?  Yeah, because you got  the peanut butter in there  and you got the strawberries.  J, J.  I went to a dentist yesterday.  Oh yeah, how did that go?  Very sad Twitter face.  I know, I was very frightened.  No, I'm not frightened.  But I haven't been to the dentist  in a couple of years.  I just really go.  So I'm like,  all right, tooth is cracked. 
[02:11:30]  I'm fucking going.  Then I went  and they took an x-ray  and then it's like,  oh yeah, well that's got to go.  I'm like, yeah, I know.  The tooth has to go?  Yeah.  They couldn't like  patch it up like they did mine?  This thing is fucking like  shattered.  Oh, that sucks.  And it's a wisdom tooth.  So it's like,  You think you're going to dig it out?  I have all four  of my wisdom teeth still.  Do you?  Yeah.  What are you, fucking 13?  They grew in  and there was never a problem.  Same here, Jim Morton.  Yeah.  Never had a problem  with my wisdom teeth. 
[02:12:00]  They're in there perfect.  Mine came in like fucking,  like that extra person  that grows on a fucking twin.  A conjoined twin.  Like an old graveyard.  Yeah.  They're all,  and fuck,  I had to have them taken out.  It was terrible.  Wow.  Oh my God,  you look really sad at the dentist.  I didn't see this Vine video.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  I don't like the dentist,  but she's nice though.  That's Anthony  after watching a movie  about Brown versus Board of Education.  So I go and she's like, 
[02:12:30]  oh, we need the,  you got to go to the oral surgeon  to have that pulled out.  She goes,  I pulled teeth,  but that one's,  you know,  kind of in a few pieces  and hooked in there.  Nice.  It's in the back.  So you got to go to the oral surgeon  who was right upstairs.  I'm like,  oh, good.  But he leaves.  He's already gone.  So call him in the morning.  So I got to call him today  and hopefully I get in there.  But in the meantime,  it's still just hacking away  at the inside of my cheek.  Is he going to pull it today?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Aren't you feeling the nerve right now? 
[02:13:00]  What do you mean?  Fucking the nerve.  Is it exposed?  Oh, no, no.  If I get cold water on it,  I can.  But, no,  it's more just the way  it's grinding away at the...  Can you do the tinfoil test?  Oh, no.  No.  Do the tinfoil test.  Oh, no.  There's no way  I'm doing the tinfoil test.  Why is that?  I'm not doing the tinfoil test.  Who wants to try  the tinfoil test today?  Anyone brave enough to do it?  Why?  Why is that one a brutal one?  It hurts.  Awful.  E-Rock. 
[02:13:30]  Tinfoil test today?  No, I got too many fillings.  What does it do?  I don't even...  I'm sitting here  trying to explain...  I'm thinking to myself,  how do you even explain  what it does?  I don't know.  How do you explain that?  It feels like electricity  is shooting through your...  It's like completing a circuit.  Yeah.  It gives a very metallic taste  and it's a very sharp zing  that goes up the tooth.  Right.  Because of the...  It is some kind of  chemical reaction  between the aluminum  and your filling. 
[02:14:00]  It's a weird fucking thing.  That's brutal, though.  She's also...  Because now I'm in  for the long haul here.  The cavities and such.  Everything.  You know, fucking...  Deep cleaning?  The crowns,  the fucking...  Take care of it.  What else is she doing?  Everything.  Exactly.  And she also replaces  all of your old  amalgam fillings.  Yeah, I had that done.  She drills them all out  and puts the white fillings in.  Yeah, it's awesome.  White is right.  That's what I say.  What?  Fillings.  Oh, yeah.  I've been...  She takes them out.  I go to the dentist  in my building  who I like a lot. 
[02:14:30]  He's, uh...  You go to...  Oh, you go to the same guy, right?  Yeah, we have the same people.  That's fine.  We're both healthy young men.  And I ask about your teeth  and you ask about mine.  You used to go to this dentist.  Oh, did I?  She's, uh...  She's, uh...  Dr. K, I guess.  She's Russian, I think.  Well, I didn't like her  because she was in a hurry.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm too good.  She's kind of, uh, pretty.  I honestly don't remember her.  I think Bobby went there.  Bob Kelly went to her also.  And texted me.  He goes,  who's the woman  you used to see on Long Island?  And I didn't remember.  Melinda went to her. 
[02:15:00]  Wow.  She's a very attractive woman.  Does she put her boobies  in your face?  Well, yeah.  When she's, you know,  poking away in there.  Leaning over a little bit.  Poking away.  My guy's good, man.  I love our guy.  Yeah?  Yeah, I do.  I like him.  Why do we have the same guys?  I like to have a girly dentist.  We live one building  across from each other.  We have the same gym.  We have the same cleaning lady.  The same dentist.  We do the same cleaning lady.  And we have the same doctor  for a while.  Yeah.  I hated her.  I don't love her either.  She's no bedside manner.  None.  Does race matter to you 
[02:15:30]  with doctors?  No.  I don't care.  It does to me.  When I look for a doctor  or a dentist.  You didn't need to say that.  I look and I try  to figure out the name.  See if the name is  somebody who might be  of my same race.  I just trust my own race more.  What about like  an Indian doctor?  Yeah, I don't mind  an Indian doctor.  They seem to be pretty good.  Oh, believe me,  I don't mind Indian doctors.  Yeah, yeah.  I got a black bra  that cleans my teeth.  Sassy black bra.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's cool though.  She's very nice.  Well, there's two of them.  The one will tell you  everything that's wrong  with your mouth.  Yeah? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, she's the worst.  And then the other one  is nice.  But she drums up the business.  She's the worst.  But the one that's like  has to tell you  everything wrong  with your mouth,  she actually does  a very, very good job.  Yeah?  Yes.  And it's like Junior Soprano  who just wants Dr. Kennedy.  Dr. Kennedy.  Nobody else can do it.  Oh, here he is,  Dr. Kennedy.  What happened?  Furio is my favorite character.  Oh, Furio.  When he was falling in love  with Carmella.  You didn't like that storyline?  No, I hated it.  He's a tough guy  and he gets all pussy whipped  for that pig.  Oh, Tony, 
[02:16:30]  is Furio coming today?  Oh, Furio,  you want some coffee?  Come in for some coffee, Furio.  Not believable.  Not at all.  What's better though  than the acting  they did in that argument scene  when she fucking,  I was in love with him.  God damn,  because she fucking acted.  I think she was,  as much as he was great,  I think she was the best  pure actor in the series.  She was very good.  She's amazing.  She played up that,  you know,  disapproving  but isn't going anywhere wife.  That cunty smile. 
[02:17:00]  Such a hypocrite she was.  Oh, she was great.  She was so hypocritical.  When you watch the show  the second time around,  you really pick out  more on the characters  than you did  when you watched it  the first time  and you realize  how like selfish  some of them were,  how hypocritical and stuff  because you think,  you think she's like  the good person  in the show  and after watching it  the first time,  you're like,  oh yeah,  fucking she,  she's the fucking  good wife  and trying to do it  but she's just a hypocrite.  Sure.  She fucking,  she was terrible too. 
[02:17:30]  Christopher was hateable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Watching that  the second time around,  you're just like,  hate his guts.  Nothing good about him  and then,  what's his name?  Poor guy with the trains.  Bobby.  Bobby.  I liked Bobby Bacalat  through the whole show.  Yeah, he was one eyes straight.  From when he came in  till he was fucking  bleeding over that train set.  When he walked in  with the camo on  because they were going  out to the Pineburn.  Yeah.  You wake me up  in the middle of the night  and now you're  busting my balls.  When he's playing  with his trains  and Tony walks up  to the garage,  he's got the little  engineer hat on. 
[02:18:00]  What's funny you doing?  I felt so bad for him.  Yeah, Tony's just,  what the fuck  are you doing?  I'm here on my own time.  Oh, Tony.  What a great show.  Fuck, man.  That was a great show.  We always fall into  the great scenes.  Soprano conversations  we get into, yeah.  What's up with the dentist?  So are you going  to get some cavities?  Yeah, so I got to do that  and then have all the  silver fillings redone  and then, you know,  start with the cosmetics. 
[02:18:30]  Get that fucking shit right.  You don't like  a good teeth cleaning?  I love getting my teeth cleaned.  I don't like that.  But you haven't gone  in a while.  No, and when I was a kid,  I got fucking stained teeth  because when I was a kid,  I had to take tetracycline  because that's all they had  for fucking zits back then.  Oh, it was terrible.  How does that stain teeth?  What does it do?  It just does.  It fucking gives them  like a grayish thing.  And yeah, it's terrible.  Fucking old days.  Goddamn, I could have  just taken Accutane. 
[02:19:00]  They didn't invent it yet.  Are you getting fake teeth?  No, I'm not.  I don't know why I'm going to...  Are you going to come in here  like Leonard Nimoy?  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  I know we've been at this  a long time.  I don't know if I could do radio  if I come in here  with fake teeth.  Look, I can't do it.  I'm looking at some options.  I can't do it.  But I am looking at a laminant.  Not caps.  Not implants.  Not just the same teeth I have.  Right.  But a very thin laminant over it 
[02:19:30]  to make it white.  Individually placed.  Like the follicles.  Exactly.  Are we going to have to make believe  that you're talking differently  because you've got to let her  need more teeth?  Hey, I'm Dice.  Oh.  I'll do my impressions.  Live long and prosper, Opie.  I know people get fake teeth,  but we've been at this too long.  I know.  I can't look at you  with fake teeth.  Believe me, I'll wear a fucking...  I'll wear something...  I'll wear a veil. 
[02:20:00]  I'll wear a fucking veil  so you won't see it.  No, I don't know.  And that's not for a while,  but I might...  I might...  I might...  I'm looking...  I need a bunch of dental work  done in the first place.  So it'll be a while.  But in that time,  I'll look at the various options  for teeth...  Treat yourself.  What the fuck?  Whitening and just looking  a little straighter.  I get it whitens.  Oh, the teeth whitening is brutal.  It hurts.  It pings for a day or two.  Oh, that's terrible.  But afterwards,  I just can't stop smiling.  Hey, hey, hey! 
[02:20:30]  Smile, smile!  What is it?  The chemical getting  into the pores of the teeth?  Yeah, it's good.  And it does hurt.  No, but it fucking hurts  for like two days.  It's the worst pain  for a split, split second  all day long.  Yeah, it's like little pins  are going in every little pore.  And just when you can't deal with it,  it goes away.  It goes away.  It's like a ping.  And it sucks just sitting there  that long  with that shit in your mouth.  Yeah.  I did it once.  You can't lick your left  and you can't lick your left  and you can't lick your left  and you can't lick your left  and you can't lick your left  and you can't lick your left.  You're the sponsored N.E.W.  Yeah, Bright Smile.  This is a bright smile.  Yeah, they took us down there. 
[02:21:00]  It was a torture.  It was.  It's like they tortured us.  The guy I go to,  our guy is very good at it.  He's a real pro.  And they do it right.  I mean, Bright Smile,  fuck that place.  This place, I think,  did a better job.  I went to Bright Smile once  and I like this place.  That whole infrared light thing.  That's shit.  Bullshit.  I didn't do anything.  Crap.  Just no.  I went to the dentist at XM that time  when I had that bad toothache.  Yeah.  Nothing better  than when you got that fucking  throbbing toothache.  Terrible.  And then you go, 
[02:21:30]  you sit in that dentist chair,  he gets that Novocaine,  it's instantly gone.  You just go,  ah, ah, the pain is gone.  That's great.  Whether it comes back later or not  is another thing.  But just to have it go away like that,  oh my goodness.  Yeah, well, we can't all just walk in  and get it done there,  Mr. Muckety Muck.  Exactly.  Some of us have to make appointments,  finish up the job,  and go on Saturday.  What the hell do I know?  Eh, you know,  I gotta pay for the kids  fucking orthodontia.  Yeah, you wanna go get your teeth fixed  and all the doohickeys?  Eh, you go right ahead.  I got work to do.  I got three mouths full of braces 
[02:22:00]  to pay for.  Sure, kids going to college someday?  Eh, what do I do?  I take an aspirin.  I drink on the other side.  What the hell do I know?  Drink on the other side.  Oh, like a nice container  of room temperature coffee.  I remember,  I had an abscess on my gum once.  I was at work.  I was on the job.  I was knocking tin.  Did it hurt?  It hurt so bad,  I took a fucking drill screw  and just jabbed it into my gum  to relieve the pressure.  Yeah.  I just took a drill screw, 
[02:22:30]  put a lighter on it,  fucking bam!  And it just really...  Topped it?  Oh, yeah.  It was disgusting.  Holy fuck.  But the pain went right away.  Good for you.  The pain went right away.  I don't know if I'd be able to do that.  No!  Then I went to the dentist.  Why not just go to the dentist  and have him do it?  Because it just hurt so bad  and I couldn't get an appointment  right away.  And the pain was debilitating.  Yeah.  So it's just fuck this.  Wow.  You popped that shit.  Yeah, that's balls.  What balls?  Oh, it hurts so bad. 
[02:23:00]  You're talking about teeth.  One thing I didn't realize  when you become a father,  I gotta brush my kid's teeth.  You guys do a little toothbrush?  I guess...  Put toothpaste on brush  about the size of a pea.  I just assumed that,  I don't know,  they get to an age  and they brush their own fucking teeth.  Yeah.  No!  No?  It's a process.  Really?  They don't want to keep their mouth open?  What do you like?  Stand still!  My kid is like,  can I tell you something?  No, you can't tell me something.  You gotta brush your teeth! 
[02:23:30]  But I gotta tell you something first.  What?  And then it's nonsense.  It's nothing.  It's nothing.  It takes 10 to 15 minutes  every night.  And then the second one  is coming up,  so I'm gonna have to  brush her teeth too.  Jesus.  I barely want to brush my own!  Are you teaching him  each time you do it?  I try, yeah.  But then, you know,  we took him to his first  dentist appointment  and the dentist.  We thought it was  a kid-friendly dentist.  Another thing you gotta,  you know, worry about.  And she was just a twat.  Why not go to the one  we go to? 
[02:24:00]  He's a good dude.  Well, I didn't know  he did kids, you know,  in that way or whatever.  So, and the lady's  all annoyed.  Like, his teeth are all  already calcified.  I'm like,  well, what the fuck?  We don't know.  He's only three.  What's that mean, calcified?  I don't know.  I guess you're  fucking getting some  shit on your teeth.  Oh, you ought to  teach him the  toothbrush song.  But those are gonna  fall out anyway,  so who cares if we  take care of them?  Right.  I figured I'll be  diligent with the  second set.  Second set. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  It's all about the  second set, right?  Right.  You could pick up  the spare.  Jesus.  It's a nightmare.  You didn't teach him  the toothbrush song.  That makes it fun.  Oh, what's that?  The toothbrush song,  Jimmy.  Oh, you gotta brush  those fellas,  get them nice and  white, brush those  fellas in the morning  and the night.  It's not that bad.  I just made it up.  It's very good.  I know it's good.  It's better than any  fucking kid song I have  to listen to.  I'm sure once it's  repurposed into a  three-minute bit,  it'll be even better.  Crest is dog shit, 
[02:25:00]  by the way.  You don't like  Crest?  No, I'd rather  brush my teeth  with fucking  foot odor.  I hate it.  Makes your mouth  all dry.  What do they put  in it?  Fucking sand  and farts?  Does Edgar like it?  Yes, I put a dab  on my teeth  and leave it.  A dab?  I brush my teeth  with gold bullion.  What?  April Falls.  Oh, I forgot 
[02:25:30]  it was April Falls  still.  It's fucking  the middle of June.  I've been brushing  my teeth with my  kid's Toy Story  toothpaste.  How was that?  Because we ran out  and I just got lazy.  Is it in a little tube?  It's berry flavored.  It's just...  Is it delicious?  Yes, you're pretty much  brushing your teeth  with candy.  With candy.  I got lazy.  Yeah.  I got to go  and get some toothpaste.  But that shit's  been laying around.  I'm like,  ah, this has got  to be good.  Yeah.  I don't think  it is.  I don't think  it has fluoride 
[02:26:00]  in it.  No?  You need the fluoride.  I don't want the kid  having the fluoride  yet or something?  Is that what they do?  No, they yelled  at us.  It was like,  the kid needs  toothpaste with fluoride.  I'm like,  all right,  well, how the fuck  did we know?  Yeah, people are  down on fluoride  for some reason.  Are they?  Yeah, some people  are like,  oh, it's in the water.  I don't care.  Everything's in the water.  Fluoride's delicious.  It is delicious.  Yeah, so today,  this afternoon,  I'm hoping I can  maybe get a little  time.  And get the tooth  pulled.  And have this  janked out  because eating 
[02:26:30]  and speaking  are becoming  more difficult  by the day.  You've got like  shards of fucking  glass in your mouth.  It's very sharp.  I have a very  sharp edge.  And then she's  checking the other  teeth.  She goes,  oh, this one right  here doesn't even  have a side on it.  She's like,  this tooth,  there's the filling,  it's still in it,  but the side of the  tooth is gone.  So it's like,  there's filling.  Right.  Which was filling up  the tooth,  and now it's just there.  Why did you let  your teeth go like  that?  I didn't know  that it happened.  Wouldn't that  fucking hurt?  No, it's fine.  That's just it.  It's so weird. 
[02:27:00]  I was like,  oh, I don't know.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, so.  So you're going to  get some shit done.  I know.  It's going to be  a lot of shit.  This is leading  toward false teeth.  No, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no, no.  They're all good.  They're all in there.  I'm not having  them ground down  and fucking that.  I'm not having  fucking implants,  but I'm not having  Voss fucking caps  put on.  None of that.  Yeah.  Just brush those fellas.  Could you see  I'm sitting here? 
[02:27:30]  I don't know why  that visual makes me laugh.  I hope you're just like,  ah, I can't do a show anymore.  I don't know.  I stare at you  more than anyone else  in my life.  That's true.  I stare at you  more than my wife,  I believe,  at this point.  That'd be fucking  for you, Kenny.  How much time  have you guys  spent looking at each other?  Oh, it's just amazing.  Way more than  any other person.  Yes.  It has to be.  Isn't that crazy?  Four hours a day  for 19 years.  Fuck.  Well, there's been  a few years  we didn't look  at each other at all,  but so we can  minus that time,  I guess.  We ought to get  mirror systems 
[02:28:00]  so we could see  each other reversed  for a few years.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Why don't we  take a break  and I want to  talk about  ONA Photos,  a great Twitter account  that E-Rock's been  working on  and decided  to start updating again.  He took a little  respite.  Mm-hmm.  Got the Utah lady  answering the question  properly on the  Today Show.  Yeah, she's been  making the rounds.  She's the dummy  that really fucked up  her question,  her answer to the question.  She's the dummy. 
[02:28:30]  She's the dummy  and she's been  making the rounds,  I guess on Kimmel,  was it,  or was it Fallon?  It might have been  Jimmy Fallon.  Probably Fallon.  She sang her answer  because I guess  they assumed  it would be better  in song form.  Oh, can we get that too?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know.  At least Fallon  was having fun with it,  the Today Show.  They let her answer.  And then Donald Trump  was sticking up for her.  Of course.  What'd he say?  He don't care  unless they're  on all fours  naked blowing a guy.  What'd the Trumpster say?  Well, we'll read his tweet  after the break. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, quite the tease.  Well, yeah,  because he was  sticking up for her  and basically said  that it's not fair  and there was pressure  and stress.  That's part of it, though,  is to have that  all together  under the pressure  and stress.  Is that part of the contest?  Yes, it is.  No, she's just stupid.  Ah, okay.  Don't you think?  She is, yes.  She's just stupid.  Absolutely.  It was Kimmel?  I think so.  All right.  We'll figure it all out next.  Oh, you gotta brush those fellas  getting nice and white. 
[02:29:30]  Brush those fellas  in the morning and the night.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's this, E-Rock? 
[02:30:00]  Okay, go.  Oh, right on, man.  Can I get an ice cream sandwich?  Are you serious?  What happened?  I just thought about it.  No, it's not ice cream sandwich day,  is it?  You had that shake thing.  It looked really good.  Yeah.  And then I just started thinking,  I'm like,  oh, my God,  I want an ice cream sandwich.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, I got a great Vine video  I'll do for that one.  Fucking place is gonna go nuts. 
[02:30:30]  Is it?  Is it really, Chipper?  I love Chipper.  That magic trick on Illusion  is great.  Yeah, well,  fucking the cards were slippery.  Keep your eye on the king.  Fuck.  I tried to delete that,  but it got out.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not very good  at deleting your  your failed Vines,  are you?  Bunch of bullshit.  Yeah.  There it is.  Illusion.  Keep your eye on the king. 
[02:31:00]  Cocksucker.  It's time for an illusion.  Keep your eye on the king.  Cocksucker.  It's time for an illusion.  Keep your eye on the king.  Cocksucker.  I'll get that one.  Yeah, one of these days  you'll get that illusion right.  Oh, that's the new one? 
[02:31:30]  Let me hear them.  Opie.  Anthony.  And Chipper, too.  What is that look, Chip?  Opie.  Anthony.  And Chipper, too.  I don't know what that look is.  I just want the girls  to email me.  Oh, is that what it is?  Very sexy.  Gotta get some cuda.  A cuda.  My peck has been dry.  Very funny, man. 
[02:32:00]  I love Chips Vines.  Jim Norton on the Twitter  for the Chipper videos.  Speaking of Twitter,  OA Photos has been updated  according to E-Rock.  Yeah, I was looking at some  of the yay 55-gallon drum  challenge pictures  from, wow, 2000.  I don't know what the fuck it was.  Am I in any of those pictures, E-Rock?  You would remember.  Yeah, you're not there.  You would remember  if you were here  for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Oh, I was.  You got that first one.  Okay, yeah,  because that shit was  fucking crazy.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:32:30]  Remember that.  So you go to OA Photos  on Twitter  and you get to see  old school pictures  from the N.E.W. days.  Is that the girl  we had to put in the big barrel?  Yeah.  You had to meld  two of them together?  We took like  two of those big  plastic landscaping  garbage pails.  I forgot  until I just saw this picture.  She wouldn't fit in a barrel.  Oh my God,  there's her barrel.  And we taped them together.  Ah, shit.  Everyone else  was in the 55-gallon drums.  Yeah.  But we had to make  a special fucking...  Could you imagine us 
[02:33:00]  getting near doing this?  No.  I don't even know  if I'd want to do this.  It seems...  Some of the stuff  we used to do  now just seems scary  to even try.  Very scary.  Remember the cricket  went in one girl's ear  and she had to be  taken to the hospital?  All bloody?  Yeah, we had poured  blood on her  and guts and everything.  So when they took her  out on a stretcher,  she was covered in blood.  It looked like  she had fallen down  an elevator shaft.  And she's on a stretcher 
[02:33:30]  being taken out  of the elevator  and people were  literally gasping  in shock.  And there was just  a cricket in the ear.  Cricket in her ear.  I think that was  a later one, though.  I don't think  it's in this one here.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think that is.  We did do this  a couple of times.  Who was there for that?  Oh, man.  Those muffled screams  with the echo  of the barrel.  It was fantastic.  Oh, my God.  Just throwing  all kinds of crap.  Remember how exhausting  those shows were?  Oh, God.  The cleanup  must have been amazing.  Who's that young  lipper snapper?  They found crickets  in the floorboards. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  We would hear crickets  weeks after.  It's like,  what the fuck is that?  We'd hear the crickets.  Yeah.  Pouring beer  on the girls.  I had a beer  in my hand,  of course.  Just pouring  fucking...  Oh, yeah.  And we didn't even  try out the stuff.  Didn't...  We put kitty litter  in there, yeah.  The kitty litter  became kind of toxic.  It was all dusty  and they couldn't breathe.  Right.  We didn't know.  Joking.  We didn't know.  We'd have to put straws 
[02:34:30]  through the little  breathing holes  so they could drink water.  Right.  Look at the hands  popping up  all desperate.  God, man.  We just took  crazy chances.  Think about it.  I remember I fucked  a girl over the toilet  after the 55-gallon  drum challenge.  She went in  and washed herself off  and I took her  in the bathroom  and fucked her  bent over the toilet  when you guys  were back on the air.  Stunk my...  She wasn't disgusted  enough.  Believe me, I know.  Fucking smelled  like a 55-gallon drum  and I'm sticking  my dick in her  over a toilet. 
[02:35:00]  Was that ice?  Was that the...  You watched  Suck my dick, yeah.  She was a fucking  good egg.  I didn't watch.  I took a peek.  To me, it makes  it sound like I  fucking was  in the front row  for this big show.  You watched  Suck my cock,  no big deal.  We were going  out to dinner  and you dropped  her back off  at the Port Authority  and as we're  going through  Times Square,  Jimmy gets my  attention with  the rear view  mirror like,  you gotta see this  and she's blowing  him as we're  riding through  Times Square. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  Trooper.  Threw her back  on a bus,  a 16-hour bus ride  because I had to  stop at every  little town  after he fucked  her over the  curlettes.  Yeah, then  something I  prick into her  mouth with my  friend watching.  Treat a lady.  That is fucked  up, man.  Remember how the  whole floor would  stink?  Yeah, yeah.  Just stunk.  Yeah, people got  pissed at us.  Yeah.  We didn't realize  how bad it smelled.  It smelled horrible.  We had a lot of  bits like that.  Yeah.  Where a sales guy 
[02:36:00]  would come in  in a tie and go,  it smells like shit  and you didn't know  because you were in  it for a long time  or something?  I don't know.  Remember the  couple we had  fucking on the  new rug?  That's Jamaican  Mike, right?  It smelled like  ass.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We had an ass  smell for a while.  The new carpet,  we wanted to  break it in so  we had a couple  have sex on the  floor.  Right.  And he's like  railing her and  he just had like  swamp ass.  It was horrible.  It was terrible.  It stunk the  whole fucking  studio up.  What else is on  OA Photos, 
[02:36:30]  Z-Rock?  We remember the  55-gallon drum  challenge.  This may not be  too big a deal,  but it was a  little fun for me  when you started  destroying the  world's largest  rock and roll  library.  Oh, nice.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that  one.  You got pictures  of that?  There's a huge  pile of, I guess  you broke  everything that  had to do with  Bruce Springsteen.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, we had a  problem with  Springsteen that  day.  We just weren't  into working at  a station that  played Springsteen  is all.  And I found a  bunch of different  lesbian for a day  events.  Oh, lesbian for a  day was very good.  social, there was a 
[02:37:00]  pool party.  Hold on, hold on,  go back.  Someone actually  got an O&A  ass tattoo?  Yeah, I don't  know what it was,  but it says O-A  on it.  I don't remember  this.  Some of this  shit I don't  remember.  I don't remember  that either.  Then again, I was  pretty intoxicated  the entire fucking  run.  Yeah.  Stinky in the  office.  Oh, look at that.  It's adorable.  Was that Spaz's  letter of  resignation?  Probably.  I am much too  smart to be here. 
[02:37:30]  I've invented  things that have  come to fruition.  Holy fuck.  Oh, yeah.  That's the  rock and roll  library.  They took pride in  their rock and roll  library and we  showed them what  we thought of it.  Oh, my God.  That was 6-13-2000.  We destroyed the  whole Springsteen  catalog.  I forgot why.  We were just mad.  Oh, God.  The rat eating.  Was that with that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you got pictures  from the rat eating  contest.  Let me see some of  those real fast.  That's Frenchy.  Very visual.  I understand.  But go to  OA Photos on 
[02:38:00]  Twitter.  Brian Regan.  Regan.  Was there.  That's right.  Regan was there.  Yeah.  I'm going to put  it in your A.  Yay.  And then wipe  your C on the  curtains.  Hold on.  Look how big  Steve was.  Jesus.  Suck it.  Suck it.  Holy fuck.  Yep.  We cooked rat.  It was the rat.  Rat au poivre.  We actually cooked  rat and people  ate it.  People ate it.  That was so  disgusting.  We got to do  bits again. 
[02:38:30]  Oh boy.  There's got to be  some of these  things we could  do again.  Well.  That's disgusting.  Fucking rat.  Oh my God.  How did we get  people to do  this?  I don't know.  Remember you used  to do your  Christopher Reeve  impression?  You used to do  your Christopher Reeve  as a DJ  impression.  I forgot about  that.  The song would  just run out  and be dead  air.  And he'd sit  there with his  head kind of  by the bottom  of the board  just looking  around desperately  with his eyes  moving back  and forth. 
[02:39:00]  Because the  record ended.  The record  ended and he  couldn't  press a button.  One of the  only impressions  I did.  That was a  great impression.  Thanks.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams  when we used  to be pals.  There he is.  I guess we're  still pals.  Right, Sam?  And that's  when Barry  was in.  We had that  stripper in.  By the way,  look at these  horrible implants.  How did we  get people  to fucking  eat rats?  Do you  remember what  we did here  a few months  ago?  We had guys  fucking  get a cock  rubbed on  their face.  That's true.  You could  remember that.  I forgot about  that.  I put that  out of my mind. 
[02:39:30]  She had  horrible  fucking  implants.  That chick.  We saw  horrible  implants.  Crystal Storm  and a  midget.  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  I remember  him.  Yeah.  Wifflebat  challenge.  Sure.  Oh, my  God.  Stinky.  Stinky pulling  off a girl's  skirt.  Ugh.  Oh, she  is awful  tits.  Fuck.  And let's  see.  All right,  she's squatting  on the bat.  Oh, on a  Coke bottle  first.  Jesus, what? 
[02:40:00]  And now  there's the  wiffle bat.  We used  to have  girls shove  wiffle ball  bat, or  wiffle bats  up their  pussy to see  how far  they could  put it.  And then  we'd keep  it in a  glass case  and have  other girls  come and  try to beat  it.  And at the  end of the  year, we  would crown  a winner.  Right.  There's  Stinky marking  the bat.  Marking it.  Oh, look at  that.  There go the  curtains.  Why?  Closing the  curtains.  It's spurs.  Made him dress up  as a boy scout  as a boy scout  one day, or an  eagle scout.  I wear my  eagle scout  uniform for  giant mosquitoes. 
[02:40:30]  This is a  cool little  sight, OA  Farms, for  some old  school shit.  That's great.  Do you want  to scroll down  a little bit  more for the  lesbian stuff?  Ice cream  social from  April 11th.  What's an  ice cream  social?  Ice cream  social?  Girls,  lesbying,  ice cream,  and what?  That's about  it.  Where is it?  God damn  that computer.  It's taking  too long.  Oh, she's  pretty.  I liked  Shannon.  I liked  Shannon.  Oh, Anthony  the limo.  Oh, that  fat puss. 
[02:41:00]  You like  that?  Yeah, I  liked  Shannon.  She was  all right.  Shannon was  pretty hot.  She's about  50.  Oh, look at  her asshole.  Spreading her  asshole right  there.  Yeah.  Spreading her  cheeks.  She's great.  I forgot  about her.  I forgot  about her.  Yeah, she's  like 50.  Her implants  weren't that  bad.  Oh, look at  the mouth  on her and  the asshole.  Oh, she's  lovely.  Jesus.  What  ate her.  Yes, she  does.  Oh, I  fucking put  cum in  every hole.  Yes.  There's  pictures of  me and  her together  for one of  the episodes.  Look at  that fucking 
[02:41:30]  long, big,  plump  puss.  Hot wax  we're  dripping on  her.  Yeah, we're  just dripping  hot wax  on her.  I filled  that full  of cum.  Thus  then,  hot wax  Shannon.  She really  got that  right on  her asshole.  We were  dripping hot  wax directly  on her  asshole.  Because  we're  assholes.  Yes.  It wasn't  good enough  for dripping  hot wax  on a hot  girl.  We have  to fucking  make sure  it had to  be right  directly on  her asshole.  Fuck.  Fucking  idiots.  More hot  wax.  Yeah, we  got her  ass.  Fun with  hot wax. 
[02:42:00]  That was  good.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What do we  got here?  The amount  of naked  girls we  saw.  Exactly.  As opposed  to this  fucking  cock and  ball fest  that we  work in.  That's  Filter.  That's  the first  time we  met you.  Superfly.  Okay, and  Triple H is  there.  Wow.  Oh, my  God.  That looks  almost like  Sarah Palin.  Lesbian  ice cream  social.  I don't  remember  having an  ice cream  social.  Holy shit.  There were  some big  tits there.  Damn.  Look at 
[02:42:30]  this.  How  suckable.  We just  have a  fucking  tarp out  and the  girls are  going at  each other.  They're  completely  naked.  We put  ice cream  and whipped  cream  and fruity  toppings on  their pussies  and tits  and they ate  it off  each other.  What a  fun event.  Look at  this.  Fascism.  Wow.  I think we  got to bring  back the  ice cream  social.  I agree.  We should.  What a fun  event.  It looks like  fun, right?  The ice cream  social.  We tried to  fancy it up, 
[02:43:00]  I guess.  This was on  regular radio.  I know.  We're not even  allowed to do  this now.  That's the  fucked up part.  This was  regular radio.  I bet you we  wouldn't be  allowed to do  this or there  would be such  stipulations we  have to once again  go off.  Forget about  it.  Holy shit.  OA scam.  O-P-A-N-T  scam.  What is that?  I have no idea.  Wasn't that that  fake fight they  set you up on?  Paul Bond.  What the fuck?  There was a  shirt for that?  There was not a  fake fight. 
[02:43:30]  Where you wanted to  punch Paul Bond?  No, I did.  Yeah, you did.  I fucked up his  eye socket.  And then I  thought Billy  Staples was  going to beat  the shit out of  me.  That was kind  of scary.  Jay Moore was  in on that.  Jay Bullets.  Anyway.  Right.  What else?  Scroll down a  little bit more  for the left.  Velvet.  Wait, who's  Velvet?  That's a black  Velvet.  I don't remember  Velvet.  What was she  about?  Velvet.  Let's see  Velvet's ass.  Oh, okay.  She has nice  velvety cheeks.  What was Velvet  about, Iraq? 
[02:44:00]  I have no clue.  I don't remember  Velvet.  I don't know  who Velvet was.  Brother Joe?  Oh, Jesus.  See, that happened  again, though.  Look at Joe.  Wow.  Joe.  K-Dawg doing his  weekend review,  his little radio  show.  I like how you  used to make  him dress up.  Yeah, of course.  Wow.  We're classy  people.  Fingers tip  off.  Homosexuality.  Black girl.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The fingers.  The gay fingers.  The gay fingers.  Finger, right?  There was one  finger, they said,  if you have it.  Yeah, if one is  longer than the 
[02:44:30]  other.  I forgot which  one it was,  though, and we  made Earl put  his hand down  and he had the  gay finger.  I think he did  have the gay finger.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to the next  page, Sam, before  I kiss you on the  neck gently.  The computer  takes forever to  load, apparently.  Oh, you hit it?  Oh, Jesus.  It's a fucking  computer.  See the little  hourglass?  Weren't they getting  us a new computer?  There may also be  the sites being  overloaded right  Lesbian Bath.  We had Lesbian  Baths going on.  I don't remember  having a Lesbian  Bath party.  Enough with the  tub.  Where's the  Lesbians? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, whoa.  Oh, I sort of do  remember this, and  I'll tell you why.  They're bathing  each other.  The one on the  right had her  period.  No, she couldn't  smell.  Remember her?  She had no sense  of smell?  No sense of smell,  and her body  reeked.  Oh, God, that's  right.  You remember her?  Yes, yes, yes.  She did a lot of  stuff for us.  Look at her  soapy.  She looked nice  girls.  Teehee.  Holy moly.  Yeah, I remember  this, the Lesbian  Bath.  Licking each other's  tits.  What a fun job.  The one on the  left couldn't  smell. 
[02:45:30]  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Dude, there's a  fucking pool full of  water in the studio  with three girls in  it.  Where all your  engineering equipment  is right there.  Right.  Right.  Yes.  We got away  with murder.  Oh.  Yeah, the bosses  were never there.  No.  What was that?  That's, uh,  Oh, that's  Little Meadow  Soprano.  Yeah.  Oh, we made her  cry.  That was the day  she cried.  Well, we didn't  make her cry, I  think, by accident.  I don't know what  happened.  We were talking  about eating 
[02:46:00]  disorders or  something.  No one heard  her crying.  She was a little  worried about that.  Her father thanked  me personally for  that day.  Oh.  Wow helmet.  Oh, that's cool.  All these wow  pictures as well.  Oh, that's right.  They used to go to  TRL when they were  filming a TRL live.  Leather Cheerio.  You know, people  there.  Someone's holding a  sign that says  Leather Cheerio.  The Leather Cheerio.  Nice.  Oh, Jesus.  Lesbian for a day.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  Look at those  hangers.  Dude, that was the  best part of it was  just the regular girls  that used to come  down, get their  clothes off, and just  fucking start making  start making out.  We couldn't keep up  with that one.  They wanted to do  that every Friday  for a while.  Yeah, they wanted  a lesbian couch.  Who's that gal?  Who's that fiery gal  pulling your hair?  Ivory from WWE.  Remember Ivory, right?  Of course.  Yeah.  She used to do our  show on a regular  basis.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I wonder what ever  happened to her.  That's when Opie  still had the  Prince Valiant look.  Man.  Go back up. 
[02:47:00]  I want to see  some more pictures.  Anne had a ponytail,  an op-ed that  kind of like  the Prince Valiant.  Jesus.  Wow.  You can't describe  it better than that?  Prince Valiant.  That's what I'm  wondering.  The blonde Prince  Valiant.  Prince Valiant.  Oh, my ice cream  Sammy.  We've only uploaded  half of the year  2000, so.  Take a little ice cream  for yourself, Jackie.  How many ice creams  did you get?  Thanks, Jackie.  I don't want to. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, God.  I'm going to have  this one.  I'm a weak man.  I like this mess.  Jackie, put this over  there by Gregorio.  No, no, I don't  want any.  Take him out of  the studio.  I don't want him.  I think they need  to go on a freezer.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm just going to  have this.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  These are so good.  There's a chippy  chip.  What's that?  Chippy chip?  We used to have  an ice cream social,  and now you're just  eating an ice cream  sandwich.  Right?  How times have  fucking changed.  So go to  OA Photos,  and you can check out 
[02:48:00]  the pictures we were  just checking out.  That's fantastic.  There's a couple  hundred up there now.  A couple hundred new ones.  Top of the page.  It says,  Photos are copyright  Eric Nagel.  You're copywriting  our photos?  With the Foundry logo  in the corner.  How are you  copywriting our photo?  Yeah.  It was supposed to be  for when the  satellite year  galleries are going up,  but it just went  on everything,  so I'm trying to  figure that out still.  No, you're not.  Eric, you're trying  to fucking hijack  our old pictures. 
[02:48:30]  Are you taking  our material?  No.  Maybe.  Oh, God.  He's stealing our  kit.  Does anybody want  this?  I'm going to take  one bite and  throw it out.  Nope.  Nope.  Iraq.  Yeah.  What made you put  copyright Eric Nagel?  Because I put it up  when I made the  satellite page,  and it goes on  everything.  You don't have a  copyright on those  pictures either.  Yeah.  They're all mine.  No, they're not.  You got caught.  You're hijacking our  shit.  I post moon landing  photos with copyright 
[02:49:00]  Jim Norton.  Does that mean I own  them?  Rob in Michigan.  Rob.  Yeah.  The first time I ever  heard you guys in  satellite was when  wheelchair Fred was  on the phone,  and he had him put a  dildo in his ass  in the bathtub.  And I never heard  anything back from  the guy.  What happened to him?  It was the funniest  thing I've ever heard.  And we left him  hanging, if you  remember.  I remember him  saying, hold on, 
[02:49:30]  I'm getting it.  Wheelchair Fred was  a classic.  We lost touch with  him.  He's up there in  Massachusetts somewhere,  hopefully still alive.  He was in a  horrendous motorcycle  accident and fucked  him up bad.  And the best  wheelchair Fred bit  ever was at the  live appearance when  we convinced him that  he could fucking  stand.  We were trying to  faith heal him.  Right.  We tried to faith  heal him in front of  a crowd, and they  were our fans at the  time.  They got so mad at us, 
[02:50:00]  they started throwing  CDs and everything  they could find at us  on stage.  They were fucking  pissed.  We couldn't faith heal  him, and he fell  down.  But it was based on the  fact that he would  come in studio, and  he would kind of get  himself up on his  legs.  He would get out of  the wheelchair, but he  was kind of like really  strong upper body-wise.  Yeah, so he'd hold  on to the console with  his arms.  So Ant was convinced  that he could possibly  do this in front of a  live audience, and we  would look like faith  healers.  We'd look amazing.  But when he realized 
[02:50:30]  his muscles were still  dead, his legs were  still dead, he decided  to try to grab onto the  mic stand that the band  was using.  And he went fucking,  he fell into everything.  Remember the noise he  made?  Yeah.  And people went from,  this is kind of fun,  and kind of funny, to  they were fucking  pissed.  Yeah.  They were mad that  day.  God, that was fucking  good.  Do we have a wheelchair  Fred bit we could play  today?  I could just eat those 
[02:51:00]  I took three bites of  that fucking chocolate  mousse thing and threw  it out.  Three bites.  So good, right?  Amazing, but I'm happy  I only took three bites.  Listeners, did you hear  that?  Jimmy took three bites.  I'm saying that's how  fuck, yeah, that's how  hard it is.  You think I don't want to  eat the whole thing?  Three bites and throw  the fucking thing out.  They're happy for you.  They love when we talk  about our food.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's all I'm doing.  But I'm saying how good  that is, man.  I wanted to eat all of  it.  Real chair Fred putting  a dildo up his ass  live on our show,  on regular video.  It was hot.  And then leaving  them hanging.  They did the dildo 
[02:51:30]  with my ass, oh.  I got it in my ass.  Eric, you don't own  any photos of that?  Yeah.  You rock.  Your vast collection  of copywritten material?  Yeah.  Do you have that bit?  That's from AAF.  We could play that one.  We're allowed to play that one.  But plug from Demented World?  Nah.  Not that one?  Well, that was good,  but nah.  I'm trying to find  the phone call he did here.  Yeah, that's this week's  nugget, the original version.  O&A Podcast, the new one, 
[02:52:00]  is available today.  So.  God.  What?  Just have those girls  come in and get all  fucking naked.  I fucking, it's amazing.  It was great.  Like, it was nothing.  Yeah.  It was effortless.  But not here.  No one, no one even  fucking, didn't sit us  down once and say  you can't do that.  Those were some  bang-up shows  back in the day.  Now we're in this  wonderful studio.  Then we'd have, um, 
[02:52:30]  RoninFez.com!  We'd come on.  Dot net, I think, even.  It was RoninFez.com.  Was it?  Uh.  I thought it was  .net.  Not the show.  No, that was like  the website.  Yeah.  But their show was  like RoninFez.com.  Right.  And they would talk  about like computer  stuff for like a second.  And then.  Because everything  had to have a theme.  Yeah, yeah.  Couldn't just put,  you know, a talented  show on the air.  You had to fucking  have a theme to it.  Yeah.  Sports guys!  Sports guys!  The sports guys. 
[02:53:00]  Did you like that  song, that theme?  No.  Sports guys!  And then who was  the fucking morning  show with the chick  and the dude?  Kalinske.  Mason and Kalinske.  Mason and Kalinske.  Sue Kalinske.  I remember I met  her at Cowan's  before I was with  you guys, but I  thought she was  such a big shot  because she was  like a host of  a morning show  in New York.  I'm like, fuck!  You have to be  a big shot.  Didn't ya?  I hate that person.  She was a nice lady.  Yeah, she was.  Anyway. 
[02:53:30]  No wheelchair  Fred dildo action?  Yeah, I'll have  it in a second.  And then, of course,  the radio chick.  The Rack is back.  What is she doing now?  What is she doing?  Podcast something, right?  Yeah.  She fills in on Fox radio.  Oh, he's just smiling  and throwing his arms out.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Lost touch.  She was like if  your grandmother  had nice tits.  I see her walking 
[02:54:00]  around the neighborhood.  Oh, you do?  She sees me, too.  Oh, yeah.  There's no real  acknowledgement.  Ew.  Yeah, there ended up  being some bad blood there.  But there was no incident.  There was nothing.  I know.  Oh, what the fuck?  Probably said, like,  nasty things about her a lot.  I think their show  really was  trying to  like  they wanted to be  the morning show.  What?  They wanted to be 
[02:54:30]  the fucking morning show.  There was a lot of resentment.  When were they on?  I don't even know.  Wow.  Fucking wacky midday thing  that was going on.  Yeah.  I got a three-minute clip  of Wheelchair Fred  if you want.  Oh, yeah?  What is it, though?  Is it reasonable?  Tim in the bathtub  using a dildo on himself.  Yeah.  That's the bit  we're talking about.  Yeah, you're deciding  to just be quiet  and let him do what he does.  You really want to hear this? 
[02:55:00]  Yes.  I haven't heard this  in probably...  This is not...  I think this is...  Oh, no, we're allowed  to play this one.  The whole thing  was 17 minutes.  If you don't play it,  I'm going to kiss your fingers.  Why do you only have  a three-minute clip?  Because I was just  getting to the real  heart of the...  Oh, you were fast-forwarding  to the bullshit.  Okay.  Yeah, that's cool.  All right, let me hear this.  I can hear you.  I can hear you.  Yeah.  Fred, do you, you know...  Are you going to, you know, 
[02:55:30]  finish or what?  Yeah.  Hey, Fred, is there any way  to put the phone back there  so we can hear it  going in and out?  That's all right.  Why?  I'd like to hear that, Oop.  He can't hear us.  I think the ultimate  in degradation  would just be  to hang up on him  and leave him there  in the tub  and no one to talk to.  We'll do the silent game  to him.  Yeah, silent game.  All right.  So, Fred,  how's it going in there?  Oh, marvelous. 
[02:56:00]  I'm picking up speed  nice and fast.  Make it count.  Oh, marvelous.  Oh, marvelous.  Oh, marvelous.  Oh, marvelous.  I've got them to lose.  I need a girl  from a church for me. 
[02:56:30]  Are you there?  Are you guys there?  For God's sake,  say something.  You got to run out  and work in the machine. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, marvelous.  Mom, let's go.  I just took it out.  It's all bullshit.  Oh, shit.  I say I'm bullshit.  Here we go. 
[02:57:30]  So, ladies,  come on down  and do me.  For God's sake,  do me.  Okay, I don't know  what I've had.  You guys are  later.  I'm going to go now.  I'll go wash my ass. 
[02:58:00]  So,  you guys do  first thing.  Adios.  Bye-bye.  Oh, yeah.  That's so hard  to listen to.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Is that terrible?  What the fuck  were we thinking?  It's all covered  in shit.  Oh, yeah.  It's all bullshit.  Oh, God.  Oh, do me. 
[02:58:30]  I remember he got  so desperate.  He was looking  for guys and everything.  Guys.  He didn't care what it was.  He didn't give a fuck.  He got to a point  he didn't give a fuck.  He wanted guys  to come in  and just throw him  over the bed  and fuck him in the ass.  Shit, he didn't care.  He didn't give a fuck.  Nah.  Oh, man.  That's some fucked up  repugnant shit  right there.  So we got the Miss Utah.  Yeah, that's right.  Where's the original  Miss Utah clip?  I think you played it online. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, so here's  the original Miss Utah clip.  A recent report  shows that in 40%  of American families  with children,  women are the primary earners,  yet they continue  to earn less than men.  What does this say  about society?  I think we can relate  this back to education.  and how we are  continuing to try  to strive  to figure out 
[02:59:30]  how to create jobs  right now.  That is the biggest problem.  And I think  especially the men  are seen  as the leaders of this.  And so we need  to try to figure out  how to create education  better so that we can  solve this problem.  Thank you.  Thank you, Utah.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Thank you, sweetheart.  It's 3-8 education better.  Stupid pan face.  Thank you, sweetheart. 
[03:00:00]  Have a real moment.  Why wouldn't you go,  what the hell was that?  Why?  Why does everyone have to be  so polite on TV?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't you go,  wow, you got a little  fucked up there, huh?  Yeah.  Hey, what happened there?  Yeah, what happened there?  Dropped the old ball, did you?  Jesus, not.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Nice job,  you mush-mouthed cunt.  Well, maybe not that far,  but at least acknowledge  that you heard  a really horrible answer.  Yeah.  So then Matt Lauer decided, 
[03:00:30]  well, this is a hot topic,  so we should do something  with this.  So we had that same broad  on the Today Show,  and this is how it went down.  How are you?  It's nice, it's good  to have you here.  Have a seat, please.  What was going through your mind?  Oh, my gosh.  Nothing.  So much, I can't even tell you.  I was so excited,  and I was so nervous,  and I got up to this  top five question. 
[03:01:00]  I was the first one,  and I got up,  and the question was  a little bit confusing to me,  and I just started speaking  without really processing.  Ah, you're 21 years old.  It's only your third pageant  at that stage, at that level,  and it had to be  one of those moments  you just wish you could have  dug a hole and crawled in it  for a second.  I did.  Can I give you a second chance  at the question?  Please.  All right, here was the question.  A recent report shows  that in 40% of American families  with children,  women are the primary earners, 
[03:01:30]  yet they continue to earn  less than men.  What does this say  about society?  So this is not okay.  It needs to be equal pay  for equal work,  and it's hard enough already  to earn a living,  and it shouldn't be harder  just because you're a woman.  It doesn't say anything  about society.  No.  Thank you.  Marissa, thank you very much.  She's still a dope.  That was perfect.  Wouldn't it be great  if her answer, though,  was something really awful?  Like, you know,  the problem is  there are just too many blacks,  and they're moving  into our neighborhoods  and talking to our children,  and we must fight. 
[03:02:00]  She gave some well-thought-out,  horrible fucking racist things.  Matt Lauer's just fucking  dumbfounded looking at her.  Yeah, she'll do fine.  She'll do fine in life.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then she was on  Jimmy Kimmel Live,  and this is what happened here.  You said,  and I believe this quote  is accurate,  I think we can re-relate  this back to education  and how we are continuing  to try to strive 
[03:02:30]  to figure out  how to create jobs right now.  That is the biggest problem,  and I think especially the men  are seen as the leaders of this,  and so we need to try  to figure out  how to create education better  so that we can solve this problem.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Now,  do even you have any idea  what that means?  Absolutely no clue.  You don't know.  Absolutely no clue. 
[03:03:00]  It's just the first thing  that came out of your mouth.  I did.  I was so excited  to be in the top five.  I have all of my friends  and family out there,  and I hear the question  and I don't process it,  and I just start talking,  and once I started speaking,  I couldn't take it back,  and so I was like,  well,  I better just smile,  and education.  She's being honest.  Look at her legs, man.  Well, I guess it is  a slippery slope.  I put a baby in her.  Do you,  have you watched  a clip of yourself?  Oh, I've seen it.  How many times  have you watched it?  Would you pull a Piscopo 
[03:03:30]  with her?  At least four.  Have your friends  contacted you about that?  You know,  the funny thing is,  all my friends  just want to be like,  oh my gosh,  I'm so sorry.  Oh, they are, yeah.  And I'm just like,  come on,  like,  that doesn't make me  feel better.  Yeah, no, it doesn't.  Just tell me,  you know,  it was fine,  it wasn't that bad,  and that's what  I want to tell myself  until I watch it,  and I'm like,  you know?  At any point,  did you think about  hanging yourself  with your stash?  I thought about it.  That's funny.  But, you know,  I decided it's just  better to just  not take yourself  too seriously  and learn how to laugh.  That is true.  Do you think? 
[03:04:00]  Now, I find it impressive  that you got  third runner-up,  even though you had  that debacle.  Do you think that  cost you the Miss USA title,  that answer to that question?  It's hard to say.  I know whatever happens,  happens for a reason,  and I feel like  I did great  with the rest of my competition.  I felt really solid in it,  and it just was up  to that point,  and then it was like,  well, you know what?  It happened,  and I'm owning it.  In a way,  I don't even know  who won the Miss USA contest,  and yet...  She's great.  She's not that great. 
[03:04:30]  No, she is.  She really is, though.  She's so deserving.  I'm really excited  to watch her year.  But in a way, though,  you've eclipsed her  because of this answer.  That's true, yeah.  I do feel bad about that.  I do.  But it'll blow over,  and she's going to have  her year,  and she's going  to be amazing.  I think it's going  to be a bad year for her.  I really do.  Don't say that.  Do you in any way  blame NeNe Leakes  of The Real Housewives  for asking that question?  I can't,  but all I can say  is that I know  when I was answering  the question,  I did for a second  kind of look at her,  and I know she was like,  girl, like, 
[03:05:00]  you're blowing this.  I could see it  in her face.  Girl, do you have  a coach that goes through?  Because I know  you guys prepare  for the...  Kramer, yes.  Jerry Sandusky.  Yes, I did.  I had a coach,  and I worked with him a lot.  Why doesn't he stand up  and take responsibility  for what went on?  It's not him.  That's the thing.  He prepared me so well,  and I'm used to being  in front of lots of people  and speaking,  and for whatever reason,  I just got so caught up  in the moment,  and I just started  saying silly things,  and I just went with it,  and I'm just like,  this is what happened.  You don't know in advance  what the questions 
[03:05:30]  will be, right?  No.  Do you have any idea?  No, you don't.  They can ask you anything.  So they go over  just a random assortment  of things of these weird...  I don't even know  why they ask these questions.  They can ask you anything,  and you just have to be ready  to just pull it out.  Pull it out.  And so he tests you  and asks you a variety  of questions.  Right.  It can be about yourself.  It can be about anything.  Comes right in these bitches.  It tends to be about world peace  and these big issues, though, right?  Because it seems like  they want you to look dumb  in a way.  All right.  I guess we did it.  Good job by Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah, Jimmy Kimmel's doing good.  She's fucking doing a great job. 
[03:06:00]  too, you know.  Very good.  Just fucking saying,  eh, I fucked up.  Eh, good for her.  Yeah.  Good for her.  Having fun with it.  Yeah.  Kimmel.  Kimmel's very good.  Yeah, he is.  How's he doing?  With the new time slot.  I think he's in third  or second.  I mean, I know Jay is doing  still in first,  I think, with a healthy margin,  but I think he'll be still well.  People just fucking  force a habit  put on that Tonight Show.  They just like,  let's pop down  and fuck around.  It's amazing. 
[03:06:30]  I'm telling you,  Jay gets a lot of,  I think black people  love Jay,  and yeah,  I think Jay gets  more minority viewers.  Is Jay a gangster?  No, I don't know why.  There's just something  about him that they really like.  Like his cars?  You know what?  Probably his cars.  And he's a big dick,  I've heard.  Yeah.  Obama's trip cost $100 million.  Disgusting.  It's just so crazy.  Isn't that the type of shit  you go,  all right, look,  you can't go to Africa?  How about you Skype?  The country's hurting right now,  you can't go to Africa? 
[03:07:00]  Cutbacks and things.  Well,  they want us to sacrifice.  Yeah,  there are fucking...  I think there's a lot of people  out there that would love  to go to Africa.  Employees being furloughed,  I mean,  it's...  Gotta make sacrifices.  We are.  Oh,  he tells us to make them  all the time.  That's what I mean,  so you don't get  your African trip.  Sorry.  Really?  Maybe next year  if the economy  turns around a little more.  Who wants to go  to that fucking Petri dish anyway?  Oh,  I'd go in a second.  why you'll end up  with something.  Fucking Ebola. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah,  but you get to see giraffes.  Go to Disney's Animal Kingdom.  See fucking giraffes  right out the hotel window.  It's beautiful.  But you can tell  they're in a...  Who cares?  I'm seeing a giraffe.  You can see the fences.  I'll go down there  fucking...  Where they serve the food.  Right.  You can have genuine  African food  that's been checked out  by the USDA.  Make sure everything's  on the up and up.  Exactly.  Who the hell  needs to go  to fucking real Africa?  I'd go.  Crazy ass place.  Did we talk about 
[03:08:00]  the bear video  on the show  or was that off air?  The hunter?  Climbing the tree.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  That went viral yesterday,  right?  I think so, yeah.  Guy's just kind of  hanging out on his perch.  Yeah,  he's on a little tree stand  hunting and a little  black bear came  and climbed up  the tree.  He was kind of  poking his nose  around at him.  Holy fuck.  Yes, hello.  Fuck.  Do you have any treats  for me today?  He's way up on his,  what are those things  called?  Tree stand.  Yeah.  Tree stand, I guess, 
[03:08:30]  yeah.  Hunting.  And he's got his,  it looks like he's got  a GoPro on.  Yeah.  So he's looking around,  he sees a bear down below.  Where is it?  And why didn't he shoot  the bear?  He's probably not  hunting bear.  Oh, there,  yeah,  the bear is at the  bottom of the ladder.  He's got a ladder  for his tree stand.  Yeah.  And also the bear  is just kind of  looking up  and then decides,  you know what?  That's got to be  pretty scary too.  You're up in the tree 
[03:09:00]  and the bear just  starts fucking  coming up.  The bear just  climbs the tree  like it's nothing.  I thought he climbed  the ladder.  Climbed the tree  like it's nothing.  Look how cute he is.  Whoa.  He's very cute.  And he's just  sniffing,  sniffing away  at the hunter.  At the hunter's face  because there's  the GoPro.  Is that a little  bear though?  Yeah.  It's not a big one.  Black bears don't  get like giant  like grizzlies  or round bears.  But that thing  will do some damage.  How cute.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He'll fuck you up.  Takes a look  and then it kind of 
[03:09:30]  slides back down  the tree.  I would say  a good 15 feet  in the air.  He climbed that  fucking tree quick  though, man.  He was up there  in no time.  Here's the best  part of the video  coming up.  We'll put it  on our Facebook page.  Yeah, the bear  gets all down  from the tree.  Now the hunter  knows he's safe  at this point.  Boo-boo.  Aw.  He put his little face  to see his little eyes.  Here we go.  The bear walks away.  There's another bear  down there too. 
[03:10:00]  A couple bears.  Holy shit.  Perfectly delivered.  Holy shit.  That's a good one.  Yes, Travis.  Did you see  the snake video?  No.  Sam, do you know  which one I'm talking about?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.  Oh.  The door?  Yeah.  This is fucked up.  Funny?  This one's fucked up too?  No.  No, fucked up.  Oh.  No.  This worries me. 
[03:10:30]  I like a...  Oh.  Whoa, is it creepy?  Okay.  Vimeo.  Nice.  Like the Vimeo.  Okay.  Look at Anthony.  Whoa!  Whoa!  A snake opened the door  and then fell on the ground.  That's like an albino boa  or something?  What is that?  And it's fucking...  It opened the door.  It opened the fucking door 
[03:11:00]  and fell into the room.  It fell into...  Holy shit.  His name is Julius.  Wow.  I gotta tweet that shit.  That's pretty goddamn creepy  right there.  Do you think it hurt  the snake to fall like that  or no?  Probably not.  It's like falling on your neck.  Yeah.  They're all neck.  All right.  Oh, it really does suck.  Good job.  Why isn't that video everywhere?  It's the sound  when I take my cock out  to take a piss. 
[03:11:30]  Yes, I say color too.  Jaundice in yellow.  That's today's video.  I didn't see it.  Last night slash today,  but it's three years old.  Wow.  It is.  I'll bet you that's it.  They put him on the door.  That's bullshit.  Fucking Stacey opening the door.  Why not?  It's bullshit.  Do you think?  What is it?  A velociraptor from Jurassic Park?  Yeah.  They're punching computer codes?  You don't think the snake's smart enough  to figure it out?  No, I don't.  I don't.  No.  I don't.  I don't think the fucking snake  opened the door.  No, I don't.  Why?  Use his little snake hands. 
[03:12:00]  No, here's what happened.  Someone outside held it up  and collapsed it on the door  and the fucking thing fell in  like a thud  and like,  ah, a snake?  You're a bummer.  No, I'm trying to help her with it.  Let's watch it again.  Let me see if you can see  a guy walking away.  You can't.  He just does it carefully.  A shadow.  If you can see a guy walking away,  no one will be watching this video.  That's the great part.  You can't see the guy walking away.  Let me take a look.  Yeah, let's see.  Yeah, sure. 
[03:12:30]  That's what happened.  The snake opened the door.  Yeah, yeah, sure it did.  You can see the snake's head  still on the knob.  A little bit angry, Jimmy.  The snake's head's on the knob.  The snake's body's on the knob.  Yeah.  The snake's fucking,  but watch,  his head's in the middle  of the door somewhere.  Someone propped him up  and did that  and got out of the way  and fucking dumb snake  lumbered and watched.  Look where his head is.  Hey, that's natural.  Good job.  I've dropped logs  that came out  with more thought  than the snake put into that.  I think the snake 
[03:13:00]  opened the door.  You know, real or not,  that thud gets funnier.  That thud is great.  Thud.  It looks just like a monster.  Yeah.  You don't want that  coming in your room.  We're going to step aside  Jim's advice show  in a few minutes here.  I'm going to listen  on the way home.  I like this show.  By the way,  tightrope guy,  Grand Canyon.  No fucking...  No safety wire?  No safety wire.  Yeah.  From the famous family too, right?  Well, and is... 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Was he the guy  that did Niagara Falls  with the safety wire?  I don't remember.  I don't know either.  But he's doing  the Grand Canyon  Discovery Channel,  I believe,  live this weekend.  The fact that they made him  wear that fucking wire,  they just...  That's why the networks  fucking suck dick.  Fucking assholes.  Fuck that.  Nothing was going to happen.  You watch these things  because there's a chance  that something could go  horribly wrong.  Yeah, who's going to watch  something going okay?  And then you're happy  for the guy  if he makes it  because then you're like,  holy shit,  I can finally breathe. 
[03:14:00]  Why would you do  that same thing  and have a safety harness?  Yeah, right?  Just don't do the bit.  Yeah, they don't...  They're worried about  litigation on shore.  Then don't do it  because it's not the same.  And they were trying  to have that same emotion  like, oh God,  something could go wrong  and you're like,  no, he's attached  to the wire.  Nothing's going wrong.  He'll just hang there  like an idiot  until they get him  or the helicopter  or whatever.  But not Sunday.  Grand Canyon  Discovery Channel. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  Tightrope,  no fucking safety wire.  They have a 10-second delay  but they said  that's just basic shit.  Oh, man.  If he falls,  they will cut away.  You think?  Yes.  But then we'll see it  on the internets.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's how things work  these days.  You'll think they'll cut away?  Except for Denbitz  and Bin Laden.  We don't see that.  They're defending themselves  saying it's 10 seconds  because that's basic TV now.  They'll cut away  especially with Fox News  getting sued  for that guy committing suicide.  Why are you getting sued  for that? 
[03:15:00]  That they kept it on the air  and they...  Who's suing?  The family.  The family.  Of the guy?  Yeah.  Why?  You're a fucking shitty  fucking person.  It's too fucking bad.  Did they see it live?  They didn't see it live  but they've seen it  on the internet now  and their schoolmates  have seen it.  Fuck his dumb family  and his dumb fucking  blown off head.  Cut away.  Cut away.  Cut away.  Cut away.  Get away.  Get away.  Get away.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Shep.  Oh, Shep.  What's that?  That won't happen again. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  We're sorry you had to see that.  Yeah, even though  that's the only reason  you were watching.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's literally like  the fucking porn producer  coming on  and apologizing  that cum was shot.  I'm really sorry  that you had to see  that load shot  across your tits.  We tried to cut away quickly.  I'm sure you  that won't happen again.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, shit.  Shep.  Shep was outraged. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  Jimmy Norton  doing my advice show  doing his advice show  for one hour.  I'm going to piss  and then we got some  advice coming up.  If you need some advice,  take it from Jimmy.  Yep.  All right.  And if you need  a dick in your ass,  take it from Jimmy.  Absolutely.  Right.  Exactly.  And I'm retweeting  the snake door video.  Yeah.  Sneaky snake.  Owner props snake up  and it falls.  That should be the name  of that fucking video.  Snake thrown through door.  He ain't buying it. 
[03:16:30]  You're explaining  the illusion.  I don't like you.  I like magic.  Yeah, I do too.  Let me just think  that snakes can get  in my house now.  That's creepy.  All right.  I'll see what he did.  He is there.  I just fucking tweeted  the video we just saw.  You'll be the judge.  Yeah.  You'll be the judge.  You'll be the judge.  Boy, if snakes  can open doors,  I'd sure hate to live  in a snakey neighborhood.  Opie and Anthony  have left the building.  But Jim Norton  is not going anywhere.  If you have problems  at home, 
[03:17:00]  it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show  is next.  Jim Norton  is a moderately  successful comedian,  an average author,  and a terrible actor.  And your chance  to speak directly  with him  has arrived.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines  are open.  And the Jim Norton Show  starts now.  Welcome. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, Troy.  My mic is not on  or is it on?  Okay, I couldn't  hear myself.  Troy is now  sitting across from me.  And I'm so used  to having E-Rock there.  Already,  there's been a disaster.  All right,  let's get to the show.  We'll start.  We have a couple calls  already.  Let's start with  Truth in Chicago.  Hi, Truth. 
[03:18:00]  Yo, Jim.  Hi, buddy.  I called earlier  just on the  Lil Wayne flag thingy.  Okay.  First off,  I want to say  Lil Wayne  and other rappers  have recently  also been dropped  from sponsors  already for lyrics  on their albums  and shit.  But also,  I want to just ask  your opinion  on the fact  that the whole story  was broke  due to an extra  filming  on a cell phone camera 
[03:18:30]  and how that  kind of relates  to comedians  being taken  out of context.  Well,  it's what we like.  Comedians are anybody.  We like people.  We've become  a reactive country  of twats  who we know  that the media stinks  and we know  that we get  half the story  and we know  that they rush  to get video out  because the important  thing now  is getting the scoop  and not getting  the story right  and even knowing this  we still react  a certain way 
[03:19:00]  and then we become  married to our reaction  and we don't seem  to want to be proven wrong.  But, you know,  that's just a symbol  that I've really  I'm so disgusted  with other people  in this country.  The government is shit  but you know what?  The government  is a reflection  of who we are.  So,  we like people  when they give us  saccharine,  pleasant opinions  and when they say  what we want  we punish them  when they say  what we don't want  so we are deserving 
[03:19:30]  of the fucking liars  that we have  running the place.  Thank you, buddy,  for the call  and that's just  what we do.  We take each other  out of context  in real life  and we do it  in the media  so we deserve  what we get.  Let's see here.  We have a member  of OA.  He does not want  to give his name.  Hello, sir.  Hey, I know.  It's Sonny from Boston.  Oh, hey, Sonny.  I didn't see the name.  What's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Listen, I'm very much  like Bob Kelly.  I'm on my fifth  bat right now  and being in and out  of ovaries 
[03:20:00]  and items myself,  I understand  the addiction  of food  and how that's  triggered  and how the  compulsion is triggered  and a lot of people  misunderstood the fact  that it's sugar  itself  that people  are actually  addicted to.  And the correlation  is very much  like booze  because people  when they have  that compulsion  to drink more booze  it's the sugar  in the booze  that they're actually  getting hooked to.  That's why  when we're first  getting sober  we suggest that 
[03:20:30]  hey, have a few  candy bars  and that would  call it compulsion  to drink more.  Right.  So I just wanted  to, you know  and so in OA  it's kind of like  we try to stay away  from white flour  because that turns  to sugar  and sugar itself  and try to stick  to three meals a day  but I'll tell you  something,  you're right,  it is the hardest  thing.  I gotta fucking dance  with it double  three times a day.  Right.  Well, thank you,  Sonny, I think  you're right.  Part of it is  I think sugar  probably is a big 
[03:21:00]  part of it  although with  the effect of being  drunk is very  pleasant as well  but I appreciate  the call  and eating  is a fucking  tough one.  I don't envy  anybody who's  got that  addiction terribly.  So we're not  seeing the names.  Who's been seeing  the escort in Long Island?  Iraq, how come  the names are not  showing up?  Are they putting  the names up?  Hey, Jim,  it's David.  Hi, Dave.  Hold on.  Who's answering  the phones?  Are they not  putting the names in?  They're up over here.  Yeah.  I had one of the  female interns  answer the phone.  Okay, well we're  not seeing the names.  It's all good now.  I don't know why 
[03:21:30]  that one isn't  but the rest are all.  Okay, we're good.  I haven't had a girlfriend  in more than 10 years  so for the last two years  I've been seeing escorts  about every two weeks  or so.  Okay.  I found a really good one  about two months ago  as a Russian girl.  You know, she says  she's about 27  but she looks it  and after the first  time I went to her  she complimented me  on my abilities  and you know,  they always say  those things  but then the second  time I went to her  you know,  I didn't pay anymore  and she gave me  the full GFC treatment  you know,  deep French kisses, 
[03:22:00]  everything  and she even like  went beyond the  hour time I paid for it.  Sure.  almost two hours  and towards the end  of it she's like  why don't you have  a girlfriend?  And I looked at her  straight in the eyes  and I'm like  you know,  you want to go out  sometime?  She doesn't have  any kids.  She doesn't have  like,  she's not a junkie.  Nothing.  And so now  we have a date  this Saturday.  We're going to go  see a,  you know,  we're going to go  to dinner.  We're going to  see a movie  afterwards  and I just want 
[03:22:30]  to know like,  you know,  I have reservations  but I don't know.  I mean,  she seems like,  you know,  she seems like  she could work.  Now let me ask you,  is she charging you  for the date?  No.  I mean,  you know,  I might pay  for the dinner.  No,  no,  of course.  But I mean,  are you paying  for her time at all?  No.  No,  she's like,  you know,  I said to her,  I said,  so,  you know,  what is this  going to be like?  Is this going to be  like a whole night  experience and,  you know,  are you going to want,  you know,  more donation money,  more roses?  And she's like,  no.  She's like,  I just,  you know, 
[03:23:00]  want to have a good time  on this Saturday night.  All right,  we'll see what happens.  I would say two things.  Be careful of this one  because these women  are very smart  at reading people  and she may see you  as a guy  she can get a lot  of money out of.  Or she may be serious.  It's hard to say  until you go out  with her once.  Go out with her,  see what happens,  see if she wants  to go home with you.  If she wants to go home  with you,  if she wants to charge you,  then you're just a mark.  But if she,  how do I ask  without being offensive?  I mean,  I know it sounds weird,  but how do I ask  without being like 
[03:23:30]  weird and offensive?  Because if she's not  going to charge me,  I don't want to make her  seem like a law.  So how do I say it?  Well,  she is a law.  I'm not saying that  in a shitty way.  I don't want to make her  seem like she's not  special to me.  So how do I ask  at the end of the date,  hey,  you're going to charge me  without being like  insensitive?  Because maybe she won't.  Well,  you might want to say,  like,  are you going out with me  for just for fun  or is it kind of a work thing?  You could say  kind of a work thing.  You could say,  like,  hey,  I'm not sure.  Are you going out with me  just because you want 
[03:24:00]  to hang out  or,  you know,  are you working?  You know,  you can ask her gently.  But I've had that  where I've gone out  with escorts.  You'll probably know  by the end of the night,  like,  if she wants to come back  and fuck you.  But you might want to  find out before  if she's going to want money.  But do it nicely.  Don't just go,  hey,  are you charging me?  Do I have to pay you?  Like,  don't blurt it out  that stupidly.  Again,  and she'll understand  why you're asking.  It's a fair question. 
[03:24:30]  Like,  you know,  hey,  are we going out  just to hang as friends  or is this a work issue?  And make it look like  whatever it is.  It's cool.  So if it's a work thing,  then just take her out,  fuck her,  pay her,  but don't ever think  you're going to date her.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  All right.  Good luck.  I hope you get her pregnant.  I'm just kidding.  Let's see.  My new hero,  Pete in Brooklyn.  Hi,  Pete.  Hello? 
[03:25:00]  Pete,  can you call back  because your phone  sucks dick?  It's a pizza.  He slept with his cousin  and is now freaking.  Yeah,  hang up on Pete.  Call back,  Pete,  if you can hear me  because I cannot hear you.  I can just hear  it sound like you're underwater.  So I certainly want to hear  more about that fucking.  Let's see here.  Jay in North Carolina  calls himself  a born-again virgin.  Hi, Jay.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  So, yeah, man,  I'm exactly right.  It's a born-again virgin. 
[03:25:30]  I'm 25.  I'm single.  I had a lot of fun  in high school  fucking the high school virgin  or the high school whore.  I'm sorry.  And after that,  it's kind of been  just nothing  for a long time.  And like I said,  I'm 25 now.  I got a good job.  I'm not a loser.  I got a cool dog.  I play guitar.  I'm pretty good.  And just dealing  with some loneliness  is kind of some 
[03:26:00]  tough things for me.  Okay.  Just kind of see  what kind of suggestions  you might have  to get me out of this rut  that I'm in, man.  Well, where do you go?  Where do you go  to socialize?  I mean, can you meet  a woman at work  or do you go to clubs  or do you go, you know,  you have to go somewhere  to socialize  to meet someone?  Well, the thing is,  is I don't really  like drinking.  Like, I'm not  a big drinker.  I don't like  what alcohol does to me.  Yeah, sure.  I always wake up  with the worst hangovers ever. 
[03:26:30]  I guess if you could say  that, you know,  what do you do  for escape?  A lot of times  I actually smoke  a little pot,  but other than that,  man, I mean,  I'm not a big socializer.  How about when  you're walking your dog?  Women like that.  Go to a dog park.  A lot of times  women like to talk  and pet the dog  or whatever.  Can't you do that?  Yeah, and I've done  that before,  but my dog's  kind of a bitch.  Oh, okay.  I'm working  on that one, too.  It's just,  now, when I play  my guitar,  sometimes I'll go  to some open mic nights 
[03:27:00]  and, you know,  I'm a chiver,  so I always wear  my KCCO shirts  just looking for  a way to kind of  get some  conversation started,  but it doesn't  happen, man.  I mean, I'm not  the tall, dark,  and handsome type.  I'm, you know,  five, six.  I'm a little overweight,  not too much,  but I'm working on that.  I've been working  out and dieting  and whatnot,  and it's not like  I don't have any  confidence either.  It's just,  I don't really know 
[03:27:30]  what to do  that would appease  me and also  bring others  towards me.  Well, I would say  this.  I don't know you.  I don't know what  you look like,  but I would say  this, and thank you  for the call.  I would say keep  going to the open  mics, playing the  guitar, try to work  that angle.  That's a great place  to socialize.  You'll have something  to talk about,  and eventually you'll  find somebody.  But just keep going  to the open mics.  That's my advice.  That's the best place  you're going to meet  people.  You don't have to  drink.  You have a  justifiable reason to  be there, and for a  few minutes you're the  center of attention. 
[03:28:00]  So, that's what I  would work on.  Continue doing that.  Your dog's a twat.  Forget the dog angle.  All right, John in  Virginia, advice for  the escort guy.  I love this when  people call in helping  each other.  That should be the  name of this show.  Yes, John.  Well, actually, my  name's Floyd, but  hey, that's all right.  Hey, I was young and  dumb, and I had a  decent job, and it's  real simple.  My dad was a great  tipper when I was a  kid, so I learned  tipping good, got your  places, and I was in  this guy's place, and  my advice is just 
[03:28:30]  have the money set  aside, and don't have  too much of  expectations for it.  If it works out  great, if she wants  money at the end, she  wants money at the  end.  But, Jim, I actually  have a question for  you myself, if you  don't mind.  Okay.  I'm married to a  great woman.  I mean, just an  absolutely great woman,  but our sexual  relationship has just  never been the  greatest, and I've  gotten to where  actually porn even  boards me, too, so  I'm just kind of  lost.  What do I do?  Yeah, well, I get  desensitized, too. 
[03:29:00]  When porn stops  working, that's what  addiction is.  We have to keep  one-upping it to get  to the next high.  Like, you know, what  gets me high today will  not get me high next  week, you know?  Like, at one point, it  was lesbians.  All right, then I get  out of that.  And then it was  fucking cuckold porn,  where a girl is  fucking a guy and her  husband films it, and  that doesn't work.  So then we always  have to, the only way  to really, I think,  stop that cycle from  what they tell me is  to step away from it  for a while and let  your body come back 
[03:29:30]  down a little bit.  Come back down, cool  on.  It's kind of like  letting your, you  know, this constant  stimulation, this  constant stimulation,  this constant mental  stimulation, let it just  get away from it for a  little bit.  Stop doing it, and  then your body settles  down and your brain  settles down a little  bit.  Because in order to  keep the high going,  you have to keep one-upping  and one-upping and one-upping,  and that gets exhausting,  and it gets crazy, and  sometimes it gets  dangerous.  So I would say step  away from it for a while  and see if you can.  Appreciate it, Jim.  Good luck, man. 
[03:30:00]  Love your show.  Thank you very much.  Tim in Buffalo, in a  bit of a tricky  situation.  Hello, Tim.  Wife got a new job,  huh?  Yeah, how's it going,  Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  We got a problem here,  man.  My wife just started  working at a local  doctor office, which is  great.  Everything's been going  good.  However, she is now  working with my girl  on the side.  How long have you been  fucking the girl on the  side?  Probably about six months,  I'd say.  Okay.  Nothing too long, and 
[03:30:30]  she's aware that she is  working with my wife now.  However, this girl is very  like, cuntish.  She'll go out of her way  just to make hints that,  oh, I know your husband,  blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, I have  nowhere to turn at this  point, so I'm kind of  looking for some advice.  Or if you've been there  before, just let me know,  man, because I don't know  what the hell to do with  this situation.  I've never had that  happen.  What I would try to do is  get my wife, gently try to 
[03:31:00]  get her to go to another  job.  That's not going to work.  She has a college degree,  she's been applying, you  know, she went through a  four or five month interview  process with this place.  Oh, wow.  So she's got her mind  set.  How long has the other  girl been there?  I don't know.  I venture to say maybe  two, three years.  I really don't know,  though.  She has been there for  quite some time.  I do know that, though.  Very sticky.  I would say at least be  nice to the side piece.  I'm not saying you got  to keep fucking her, but  try not to enrage her.  That's a very, there's  not much you can do. 
[03:31:30]  I mean, and if you can't  make either one of them  leave the job, and I  hate to say this is your  bed, you have to lie in  it, because I don't mean  that judgmentally, but  sometimes we do things  and it's like, okay,  here's where we're at  right now, and it is  what it is.  So there's really not  much you can do.  I would try just not to  upset the mistress,  because she's got your  balls in her hand right  now.  Yeah, she knows that,  and she's playing that  out to the best of her  ability.  So I thought about that, 
[03:32:00]  too, just trying to go  out of my way to make  her happy, which is  time-consuming at the  most.  So, yeah, I'll keep  that in mind, but I do  appreciate your time.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Yeah, good luck,  man.  That's a rough situation.  A lot of times, there's  just not much.  There's no magic answer  for that one.  You could burn the  doctor's office down,  but I wouldn't suggest  doing that.  All right, Jimmy.  Have a good one, bud.  Take care.  Andy in Baltimore,  young lady, sex life  with a husband falling  apart.  Yes.  How are you, Jimmy?  Hi, sweetheart.  All right, so I've been 
[03:32:30]  married for two years  to a great guy.  I have a child from a  previous marriage who  has Asperger's syndrome.  And when my now-husband  and I first got together,  I mean, sex was insane.  I mean, that's part of  the reason why I married  him.  Hold on, let me ask you  a question, Annie.  Did you say that you  don't have a friend with  Asperger's?  Your son has Asperger's?  My son has Asperger's.  Hold on.  Iraq, who's writing this  stuff down?  This is what it says.  Sex life with husband  falling apart has friend 
[03:33:00]  with Asperger's.  He's saying that's what  she said, but...  What the fuck is he  doing in that?  That's not what she said.  I'll take care of it.  Jesus Christ, what a dope.  Not you.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  So, as, you know, our  relationship is present  and got married, I mean,  they've always had, like,  little issues, butting heads.  But now it's getting a  little more serious.  And when they're not  getting along, I can't  fucking come.  And I'm a very sexual  person.  I enjoy it. 
[03:33:30]  I mean, it's fantastic.  But when they aren't  getting together, I cannot  get my head in the game.  I can't come.  I was even, you know,  for a while, if I would be  upset with my husband,  because I hold my husband  more responsible.  How old is your son?  I'm sorry.  How old?  He's 10.  Oh, okay.  He's a kid.  Yeah, so, I mean, I hold  my husband more responsible  when they're having issues  just because he's not  handling right.  So, I was kind of  overcoming the not-be-able-to-come  thing by, like, imagining  horrible things while he was 
[03:34:00]  fucking me, just like him  getting, like, you know,  sucking off some guy or  something like that.  She's the best.  To the point where, you  know, I could come, but  that's not even working for  me anymore.  I've tried talking to my  husband.  We've gone to behavioral  therapists for him to  understand my son better  and how he operates.  But it's just not working  and my sex life is just  going down the tubes  very, very quickly.  Well, it sounds to me like,  here's why that's probably  not working anymore. 
[03:34:30]  Because the fantasies were  probably not, like, sexual.  They were probably anger-based.  And it's like, the problem  sounds to me like you're  just angry at your husband.  And, you know, he's looking  at your son almost like  another adult.  Like, maybe he resents the  fact that another man's son  is living with him and he  doesn't know how to deal  with that.  And you can't address a  10-year-old with Asperger's  like they're a 30-year-old  that you work with.  Which is what he does.  And which infuriates me.  But is he resentful of the  fact you have a son? 
[03:35:00]  Like, maybe he's not even  aware of the fact.  Like, deep-seated resentment  is a motherfucker.  It's really, really hard.  Well, he has a son as well.  Okay.  He has a 6-year-old.  And he treats, you know,  as our, I mean, we've been  together five years, been  married for two, but as  things have progressed and,  you know, we're here and we're  as a married, you know,  trying to work out family,  his son is the golden child,  my son is flawed.  It's almost like a pissing  contest between the two of  them sometimes.  And it's, it's ridiculous. 
[03:35:30]  I mean, and it's, it's  killing me.  And, you know, I don't want  to come off as some self-centered  cunt that's like, I need to  come all the time.  No, I don't think that's  self-centered.  Okay.  Not at all.  I mean, I'm very open with  my sexuality.  That's part of the reason we  got together is because we  were so sexually compatible.  I mean, it was mind-blowing  sex.  And now, I mean, I've gone  like three months without  coming, you know, with him,  obviously with myself, it's a  different thing, but it's  just frustrating. 
[03:36:00]  And I don't know what the  next step is because like I  said, I've tried to do  behavioral therapy with all of  them sitting down to improve  their relationship.  I've, you know, gone,  different areas in my head  while we're having sex to  try to, you know, kind of  bolster it for me a little  bit.  And it's just, it's sad.  Well, your husband, I think  is the one who should  really has to, does he know  that he's behaving fucked  up?  Yes.  I mean, we've, we've had it  out before and, you know,  I tell him, you know, you're 
[03:36:30]  36, he's 10 with a  neurological disorder.  Right.  Like, you know, I've given  him books, I've tried  everything.  And I think, you know, my,  my husband, even though  he's good, he comes from a  really, really well-off  family.  So he's always had other  people kind of deal with his  problems for him.  Right.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  So I don't know if he knows  how to, and I'm not trying to  slam him, but I don't know if  he has the capabilities to  deal with certain problems on  his own without like running 
[03:37:00]  to his mom or something to  try to.  Right.  Well, he probably needs to be  more, I mean, it's hard for  you to make him be more  compassionate towards your  son, but I'm sure that any  parent, I don't have  children, but I'm sure any  parent would be very  resentful if they felt like  their new partner was being  not fucking good enough to  a, to a kid with a  disability.  I mean, look, I wouldn't  want to deal with a kid with  Asperger's.  I'm sure it's very tough to  do, especially if it's not  your kid.  I'm sure it's hard.  Even if it is your kid,  it's probably hard.  Absolutely.  And I give him credit for  even trying, but at the 
[03:37:30]  same time, it's just like,  come on, you fucking married  me, you put a ring on my  fucking finger, a package  deal with my son.  Right.  Sure.  And he knew that.  He did.  But I mean, absolutely.  My son is, can be a  handful.  You know, there's many  times I'm, you know,  huddled in a corner crying  because what I'm dealing  with, and I'm not saying  like, poor me, because  there's people that have  it harder.  Sure.  But I mean, and I do give  him credit for trying, but  it just sucks that as our 
[03:38:00]  relationship is progressing  and supposed to be going to  the next level, it's  faltering on so many  levels and it's, you  know, affecting, I need  to, I need to come to be  happy too.  Well, thank you very much  Andy for the call.  My suggestion would be  just to keep going to  therapy.  It doesn't always happen  overnight.  You know, there might be  some stuff that needs to  come out, like your son  may have a real, I mean  your husband may have a  real resentment that he's  not addressing, whatever,  or maybe he's scared,  or maybe he's just  frustrated, or it's not as  fun as he thought it was  going to be.  Whatever it is, I would  say keep going to therapy 
[03:38:30]  with it because the answer  is not going to come from  you're not coming.  I understand why you're  not coming, though.  I can't come when I'm  really angry at somebody.  It's hard for me to do  that.  Or just, you know, get  another guy and have your  husband blow him, and  then you come like an  animal and your husband  has to deal with it the  next day.  You're a fucking good  egg, Andy.  I hope your husband  doesn't blow this one.  Now, let's just say, Rob,  in Mississippi, what did I do  to stop drinking?  Oh, hey, Jim, what's  happening?  Hello, sir.  Are you still drinking  actively?  Fairly regular. 
[03:39:00]  Well, on a daily basis, I  guess, at the end of the  day, everybody's got a  vice.  Yeah.  You know, and it's just  want to just knock it  off, and I've struggled  with it for a long time,  and I know yourself, just  stop drinking.  Well, but what I did  personally to answer your  question is, I went to  rehab, I was forced into  rehab, and then a year  later, I finally went back  and started going to  12-step meetings, and I  just, I made a decision  that I didn't want to do 
[03:39:30]  it anymore, and it's a  decision you have to make  every day, and the only  decision you have to get  100% right is that I'm not  going to drink today, but I  would suggest 12-step  meetings.  Well, let me ask you,  what, in this personal  question now, I apologize  for asking, but what  brought you to that point?  You know, it's funny, I  mean, I was a really, I  was a very, very violent  drinker, so for me, it  was very apparent very  early on, like a lot of  people go, ah, you were  a teenager, I know how  old I was, but there are  things that you do as a 
[03:40:00]  teenager that are normal  teenage angst, and then  there are things you do  which are a sign of  addiction and mental  illness, and normal  people don't drink and  walk down the street with  a butcher knife after  pulling it on their  friend and hope the  police shoot them.  Like, I did these  things that I knew were  a major fucking problem,  and I knew that I was  headed to a really bad  place, and after having  been to rehab and hearing  that message, it just got  into my head, and my  last drunk was not my 
[03:40:30]  worst.  I was giving advice to a  friend of mine one day  about getting his life  together, you know how we  are when we're drunk,  you fucking dude, here's  what you need to fucking  do, you know, like an  asshole, and my girlfriend  was about to leave me at  the time, and the next  day I said, I'm going to  try going back to meetings  just to save the  relationship, and the  relationship fell apart,  and I wound up staying in  meetings.  So, what got me to that  point was just seeing this  pattern of insanity, and  even as a teenager, being  unable to leave the house  unless I had been  drinking.  I was not comfortable  leaving the house unless I 
[03:41:00]  was buzzed or drunk.  I was uncomfortable in my  own skin completely.  So that's what got me to  that point.  Well, I found that the  best way to do it is to  be abstinent from it.  I mean, I don't have to  do anything, but I feel  that the best way to do  it is just not to pick up  mind or mood-altering  substances.  And by that, I mean  alcohol or drugs.  You can call it caffeine  a mood-altering substance.  But I would say alcohol or  any type of drugs, I think  leaving alone is the best  move. 
[03:41:30]  Well, how long have you  been in the wagon now  yourself?  I don't mind.  26 years.  I stopped when I was  18.  I'm 44 now.  I was very, very lucky.  Wow.  26 years.  Very lucky.  I do appreciate you  sharing that with me.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Good luck, man.  I would try the  meetings, believe me.  The worst that can  happen is you go for  90 days and then you  save up enough money to  tie a really good drunk  on.  But just try it for 90  days.  That's the worst you do  is lose three months of  drinking.  You don't lose anything.  Oh, he's still...  Okay. 
[03:42:00]  We had a woman calling.  Let's see.  It was David, New Jersey.  A problem falling asleep.  Hi, Dave.  Hi.  Good morning, Jim.  Hey, buddy.  I have two problems,  actually.  I have problems where  the only time I could  fall asleep is when  I'm completely exhausted.  You sound like David  from Israel.  Are you David from  Israel?  Yeah, I moved back  here about a year ago.  Oh, cool, man.  Okay.  What's up, buddy?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, so if I have a  problem where I'm  laying in bed, if I'm  not completely exhausted,  I can't fall asleep.  And then the second  problem I have is that  if I randomly wake up  at three o'clock in the  morning, I'm a work addict, 
[03:42:30]  so I'm always checking my  BlackBerry.  I'm always working.  I manage teams in  different places around  the world, so I have to  constantly be working.  And if I wake up at  three in the morning and  I just feel a little bit  of energy, I'll be laying  in bed the rest of the  night, not able to sleep.  My day will be shit  because I'm going to be  tired, but there's  nothing I can do until  the next night to sleep.  Yeah.  The only real time I  actually get a good  night's sleep is when I  have to pull up all  night or I'm work all  night and I'm up for  maybe 30, 40 hours.  Then I'll sleep seven,  eight hours.  Otherwise, I'm lucky if 
[03:43:00]  I get seven hours of  semi-good sleep.  Not the same way,  David.  It's really hard.  A couple of things.  I mean, I know I have  sleep apnea.  You should, I don't  know if you do or not,  but what might be  waking you up, that  burst of energy you're  talking about could  possibly be your heart  having adrenaline sent  to it to wake you up  from apnea.  It might not be that,  but a lot of times what  happens is when I stop  breathing, my, you  know, I wake up  sometimes with a deep  itch in my ear or on  my arm. 
[03:43:30]  It feels like somebody  is tickling it with a  fucking pen tip and I  know that that's my  mind sending me that to  wake up or I wake up  with my heart going  doosh, doosh, doosh,  doosh.  And that's because when  you stop breathing,  your heart sends, or  your brain sends to  your heart adrenaline  and it fucking wakes  you up.  And then that's where  that energy comes  from.  So you might want to  look into that and  talk to a doctor and  see if you might have  sleep apnea.  And also the, the,  the, I relate so much  to the phone, the  phone's right by my  head and that fucking 
[03:44:00]  thing, dude, if you  can make yourself do  it, put it across the  room so you can't just  reach for it or turn  it the fuck off until  the next day.  Opie turns his off,  you know, turn it off  until you're not  missing anything.  And if you are missing  something, tough shit  you'll deal with it the  next day because I,  I can't, I can't do  that.  I run a company that  works 24 seven.  So I've been, I've  been, I've been  times where two in the  morning, my guys, my  guys in Cyprus wake me  up and I have no  choice but to get out of  bed.  So I think it was part of 
[03:44:30]  the fact that I know  there may be a problem.  It doesn't happen often,  but I've actually, I  walk around with two  cell phones.  I used to work around  with four.  Now I'm down to two,  but I used, I have to  have constantly at least  one phone on.  Okay.  They have to 24 seven  to reach me.  Okay.  How about this?  Can you have one phone?  The emergency phone?  Fair enough.  This, but I'm saying  emails and texts don't  wake you one phone and  your employees know this  has to be an emergency  for you to call me at  these hours.  Then I get it.  You have to have it,  but you shouldn't be 
[03:45:00]  randomly woken up by  that stuff.  If it's an emergency,  it's an emergency.  We all have that  happen, but that's  what I would say.  Maybe that will help 
[03:45:30]  with any apnea you may  have.  That's a great thing,  man.  So yeah, give it,  give it a little bit  of time and see if  that helps a lot.  But I would suggest  not checking the phone  when you wake up.  That's a hard one.  A lot of times I'll  wake up and just look  at my phone or my  Twitter.  I'm like, what the  fuck am I doing?  It's two 30 needy  twat.  Get off my phone.  I would stay away  from that.  That way that do  that technology and  out from 93 on  or the language since  how long we had  cell phones and  smartphones last 10  years.  That's one that we're  getting used to,  but this we're not 
[03:46:00]  used to an influx of  information.  You know, people are  human beings are not  designed to have  information fired into  them at 11 if we go  to bed at 1130.  You know, years ago  you'd watch a little  TV and read a book  and go to bed.  Now you can just  wake up and read the  Drudge Report and  check Twitter and  check fucking Facebook.  It's overwhelming and  it just gets the mind.  It starts firing in the  brain all those  thoughts.  So see if you can  stay off the phone a  little bit because  you're not going to be  effective the next day  when you've gotten no  sleep.  This morning I woke  up, I woke up this 
[03:46:30]  morning at 5 o'clock,  I stayed in bed until  6 and I'm wasting my  time.  I got up and I  started working because  if I'm up and I'm  doing nothing, it's  part of us and  that's what makes  the money.  It's kind of  frustrating that I  have meetings today  until 7 o'clock at  night and I'm going to  be tired the entire  day pushing Red Bull  and coffee just to get  through the day.  All right.  Well, thank you for  the call, David.  I certainly relate to  it.  Hopefully your weight  loss as that comes  will help with the  maybe what might be  sleep apnea.  But I can't give you an  amazing answer on that  because I still  suffer with it.  You guys hear me all  the time complaining  how tired I am.  Eventually I will hang  myself because I'm 
[03:47:00]  tired.  Believe me, I think of  it three times a week.  Let's just put a belt  on your neck, shithead.  Sleep.  All right.  I'm not going to do  that.  Don't worry.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's talk to Kim in  Atlanta.  What a lovely girl  Kim is.  Hi, Kim.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm doing great.  Good, good.  Me and my husband  have been married  about 20 years.  Okay.  And I guess our  sex life kind of  stalled out a little  bit, probably only  like once a month  or so.  And he always wants 
[03:47:30]  to have like a  threesome with  another girl.  And about 10 years  ago, I would have  been up for that,  but not so much  anymore.  And I'd like to  have a threesome  with another guy.  So I'm just trying  to find out how  can we resolve  this issue.  Well, it's pretty  simple.  He lets you fuck  a guy or fool  around with a guy,  maybe not fuck,  and you do a girl.  You both compromise.  Oh, okay.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Yeah, neither one  of you has to win.  Like, if he says,  I cannot see you 
[03:48:00]  with another guy,  say, well, then I  don't want to see you  with a girl, or I  don't want to do a  girl.  Like, you know, I  think that's fair if  you want that and he  wants that.  Right, right.  So that's what I  would suggest.  You don't even have  to fuck them right  away.  Why don't you do  something like go to  a swing club and  watch, and maybe  like you suck  someone's tits or  you jerk a guy  off, or he sucks  a girl's tits.  Like, maybe you  start on a scale  from one to ten  with a two.  You don't have to  start or put an ad  out and say, look,  we're not looking  for a full swap. 
[03:48:30]  We're looking for  mild play with  another couple or  just a single.  Start on a two.  Do a little light  play and touching  and then see how  you guys feel the  next day or over  the next week.  Ease into it.  You don't have to  jump headfirst into  the ice water.  Fucking ease into it.  Okay.  So when are you  going to be down  in Atlanta?  It'll be a while,  but believe me,  I'll jerk off and  watch you.  I'm a good guy.  Okay, great.  Good luck, Kim.  Bye, sweetheart.  Hi, Beverly in San  Francisco.  Husband keeps calling  other woman. 
[03:49:00]  Uh-oh.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Bev.  I've been married  for 10 years  and I just recently  about last year  and the end of the  year found a lot  of different phone  calls to different  people that I  didn't know and I  Googled these people.  I found out that  there were escorts,  one of them being  a tranny.  Okay.  I'm not sure how  to deal with that.  You should talk  to my ex-girlfriend. 
[03:49:30]  He's not the only  one who's gotten  caught.  Yeah, it's kind of  overwhelming and we  don't have a great  sex life.  He's my second  husband.  I have two daughters  from a first marriage.  There's a lot of  rage issues going on  and...  Wait, rage issues  by him or by you?  By him.  Against you?  The last one was...  I'm sorry, I'm out  on the street here  in San Francisco.  That's okay.  The last one was a  pretty big blowout  between him and my 
[03:50:00]  older...  Well, my younger  daughter, she's 20.  And he said some  pretty horrific  things to her.  And I'm kind of  at a crossroads  where I just  don't know if  it's worth it  to try and make  this marriage work  because of all  these issues.  He's not willing  to go to marital  or family counseling.  I started going  a couple of weeks  ago.  I think I know  where I'm ending  up, but I just  wanted to get  actually a male's  perspective.  Well, it sounds 
[03:50:30]  to me...  Sorry to interrupt you,  but it sounds to me  like, if you're  willing to go  to therapy  and he's not,  that's a bad thing.  I think a bad sign  for him.  Part of the problem  might be, and again,  I talk a lot about  secret resentment,  and I'm not saying  it's your fault,  but a lot of times  he may feel that he  cannot open up to you  about what he really  likes sexually  or what he wants  to fantasize about  sexually.  So he keeps it  separate.  Instead of scolding him,  and again, this is if you 
[03:51:00]  want the marriage to  work, have you talked  to him about the  escorts and the  trannies and all  that stuff?  I've mentioned it.  I said, look, I  found this on our  phone bill.  I looked them up.  This is who they  are.  What's going on?  And I've said to  him, look, let's  talk about this,  because obviously  there's something  happening, and it  doesn't seem like  this is him, but  obviously it is.  He's doing it.  Well, does he know  he's not going to be  judged?  And I'm not saying  that you did  anything wrong, but  sometimes what would  help, what would 
[03:51:30]  work with me as a  person is if you  said, look, I know  this is embarrassing  or personal stuff,  but I'm not going to  judge you on it or  scold you for it  because nothing makes  me, and again, this  guy may just be a  dick and you should  leave him, I don't  know, but nothing  makes me as a person  angrier or fucking  hate somebody more  than when I feel  scolded sexually.  Like if I feel  somebody is scolding  me and tisking me,  fuck you.  Now that's not  saying that's why  he yells at your 
[03:52:00]  daughter, there  may be shitty  personality traits  he has, but as  far as that's  concerned, that's  as a male how I  would suggest  addressing it, and  then if it doesn't  work, then maybe  you have to take  steps to leave.  So if I've done,  I mean, like I  said, we've been  married for 10  years, I've been  very much interested  in sex and wanted  to try all kinds of  different things, and  when I brought it up  in the past, he  kind of looks at  me a little funny,  so we've never 
[03:52:30]  really been able to  explore or do  anything kind of  fun and different.  This is why this  seems so strange to  me because it's out  of left field when  I've been, you know,  I'm willing to do  just about darn near  anything, and I  don't, it's like,  so wait, wait a  minute, so I'm not  good enough, but you  can call somebody on  the phone?  I don't get that.  I know, Beverly,  it's sometimes, I  think for men and  women, we both have  similarities.  We do have  differences too.  A lot of times for  men, it's a feeling  of being trapped and  not being allowed to  do things, and I'm 
[03:53:00]  not justifying cheating  in a marriage, I mean,  I know that's a  terrible thing to do,  but if you've tried to  be open with him, and  he doesn't want it, and  then he's yelling at  your daughter, and  you're not fucking that  often, and he's calling  escorts and trannies, and  he won't talk about it  even after you've  spoken, and you've  mentioned counseling,  and he won't go, if  those things are all  true, it sounds like  you've done what you're  supposed to do, and  you may have to say to  him, look, if we  don't resolve this, we  got to move on.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, it  sounds like you've 
[03:53:30]  definitely tried.  I think so.  Well, I appreciate  your advice.  Okay, Beverly, but it  sounds like you've  tried, and you know, I  wouldn't say give up  yet, but don't think  that you have to do  this for the rest of  your life where you're  begging someone for  information either.  Yeah, no, I can't live  like this.  No.  Okay, well, thank you  very much.  I appreciate your time.  Thank you very much for  the call.  I appreciate it.  A lot of women today,  this is very encouraging,  and Chrissy in New  Haven about 
[03:54:00]  overeaters.  Yes, Chrissy.  Hey, well, I'm in  Indiana, not in New  Haven, but anyway, I  just want to say props  to you for getting out  there and talking  about it, because you  know what?  When I was 366 pounds,  not one person said,  what's wrong with you,  baby?  Can I help you?  My ex-husband just  would go out and buy  me food.  Yeah, enabling, yeah.  Yeah, and the worst  part, I think the worst  absolute part is, you  have to eat.  Sure.  Eating is a social  activity.  For criminally  sake, they give you a  break at work so you  can go do it. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  But, you know, if it's  drugs, well, stay away  from the dealer, man.  If you're drinking,  don't go to the  fucking bar.  Don't walk down that  aisle at the store.  But if it's food, oh,  hell no, you're just a  fat pig, you're a piece  of crap, nobody cares.  And people do, your thing  says, uh,  that people look at  you like it's easy.  And again, I've been  guilty of that, too.  Even though I know as  an addict how hard  addiction is, I've been  guilty of going, ah,  quit fucking eating.  And at times that's  true, but at times  it's a lot deeper than  that.  Do you know how mean  people are to you  about this?  I mean, I work  seriously with people 
[03:55:00]  who would no more  use the N-word than  they would cut off  their own hand.  But our lawnmower man  is a big guy, and  they're sitting there,  hey, look at Cubby,  look at that, blah,  blah, blah.  And I'm looking at you,  I'm like, what the fuck  is wrong with you people?  Who raised you?  You know, you don't call  people out of their name  like that.  You would no more call  somebody, you know,  hey, Stumpy, you're short,  or Baldy, or whatever.  First of all, I would say  all of those things.  But yeah, I know what you  mean.  And I think part of the  problem, at least my  problem with, when I've 
[03:55:30]  had that shitty attitude  towards people who are  really fat or over, is  not like, when somebody  says, like, goddammit,  I'm caught in this  addiction and it's hard,  I'm immediately empathetic  towards them.  I immediately root for  them.  The problem is, there  comes this, like, I  guess what's annoyed me  over the time, is when  people who are 500  pounds sue the airline  because the seats aren't  big enough.  Well, and I can, you know  what, I can see that.  I've heard that and I  thought, well, you are  what you are if you know  you've got to buy two  seats.  But then again, on the 
[03:56:00]  flip side, why should  they have to?  If that's how it is, if  you're a big person, does  that make you any less of  a person?  Does that give them a  right to dehumanize you  and make you feel like  even more of a freak?  No.  Everybody in society does?  No, Chrissy, but...  And they make you feel  terrible.  B.C.  Chrissy, right there.  I flew when I was 366  pounds and I flown when  I'm 170 pounds.  And I will tell you  what, it was a real nice  thing not having to ask  for a seat.  But listen, but listen  to what you just said.  Hold on, hold on.  Listen to what you just  said.  Immediately, you said, 
[03:56:30]  like, yeah, but is that  their right to treat them  like less of a person?  Like, literally, if  someone is that big, what  they are doing, it's not  that they're less of a  person.  It's that their addiction  is affecting the two  people sitting next to  them or the one person  next to them.  Meaning, you're not  making them feel like  less of a person if  you're saying, hey, be  addicted, but your  addiction can't affect the  other people on the  plane.  But shouldn't the  airline say, OK, you're  over this certain size, you  get two seats, or we have 
[03:57:00]  bigger seats.  Oh, so the airline...  Have you been to, like,  what is it, Busch  Garden in Florida?  They actually have on the  ride, I kid you not,  there is one in every row  of, like, the big  roller coaster we went on  for people who are big.  If they have a bigger  chest or a bigger gut or  whatever, you get to ride  in this special seat.  Let me answer your  question, Chrissy.  No, I don't think the  airline should do that.  Believe me, no one has  bigger problems with the  fucking airlines than I  do.  I don't think the airline,  which is a business,  should have to lose 
[03:57:30]  revenue because somebody  has a food addiction.  In the same way, should  they put a little room in  the back because people  are alcoholics and they  say, hey, you might get  out of control on the  plane?  Like, if you're an  alcoholic...  But me sitting there,  when I was that big, me  sitting there is not  endangering anybody.  It's making somebody else  uncomfortable.  Maybe I don't want to  sit next to a stinky  person, but they don't  do anything about that.  Maybe I don't want to  sit next to a drunk and  I go, damn, you smell  like the floor of a  strip club.  So basically...  They don't do anything  about that. 
[03:58:00]  Everybody's different.  And when you go out of  your way to single  people out, because of  the difference they  have, that's  discrimination.  And that's why  people see the  airlines.  Everything you've just  said is exactly why  I've been unempathetic  towards people who are  really...  What you've just done  is justify every bit  of bullshit that  people do.  Now, you can have an  addiction.  People who are very  overweight have a food  addiction.  But all you've just  done is sat there and  justified why somebody 
[03:58:30]  shouldn't have to pay for  two seats when the  bottom line is their  addiction is what's  fucking causing them to  need two seats.  Yes, but just because  somebody's addicted to  food, their addiction is  on the outside.  Crackhead's addiction on  the inside.  Drunk's addiction on the  inside.  But if you're addiction...  Somebody who's addicted  to porn on the inside.  But if you...  Okay, fair enough.  Somebody else is on  the outside.  So if you're a sex  addict...  Hold on.  If you're a sex addict,  should you be able just  to jerk off on the  plane?  You're not endangering  anybody.  So basically...  Okay, I'm not eating on  the plane either. 
[03:59:00]  What's that?  I'm not eating on the  plane either.  I'm not feeding my  addiction on the plane.  Okay, you know what,  Chrissy?  I'm not going to argue  with you.  You're right.  You're right.  Everyone else should be  inconvenienced by your  addiction.  You're correct.  What you want is more  important.  No, no, no.  Yes, you are saying  that.  ...people feel bad  because of it.  Or to single them out  or discriminate against  them.  That's not discrimination.  If they say you have to  buy two seats because  you're too big to fit in  one, that's not 
[03:59:30]  discrimination.  It's not discrimination.  Yeah.  Of course, you're going  to say that because it  was your addiction.  Well, I'm a recovering  alcoholic and I'm a  recovering drug addict and  I'm saying that if you  flag people from drinking  on the airline or if  their behavior is unruly or  if they're doing something  that interferes with  somebody else's comfort on  the plane, then fuck their  addiction.  That's the price you pay 
[04:00:00]  for being an addict.  You get thrown off the  plane.  The price you pay for your  food addiction, maybe one  of the things that will  help you go after and fight  your addiction or get help  for your addiction is the  inconvenience it causes you.  It's not discrimination if  you're too fucking big to  fit in the seat.  Why don't they just make  the seatbelts bigger?  How about that?  Is that discrimination?  Yeah.  Maybe they should.  Absolutely.  Everybody's different.  Absolutely.  Everybody's different.  Do they pack you into a seat  if you're super skinny? 
[04:00:30]  I mean, that would that would  get.  No, no.  Hey, keep just keep  justifying it.  Keep justifying it.  All you're doing is  reinforcing.  You've never stood  somewhere.  If you haven't been there,  you've never stood somewhere  and had people point and  laugh at you.  You've never been the  victim of such ridicule for  something that honestly,  you know, it was a real  look.  No, no, Chrissy, I  understand that.  But because that's  happened, you cannot then  wipe out all of the  legitimate things that you 
[04:01:00]  bring on yourself.  You can't wipe out the  legitimate times people go,  hey, your weight is an  issue here.  You see, you the whole  country is not pointing and  laughing at you.  Ha ha, fatty.  When they say you have to  buy two seats because you're  too big and you can't lump a  bunch of schoolyard dummies  or even mean adults in with  an airline who is doing  something saying, look,  you're just too big.  If they do it in a  dignified fashion and I  don't think they should get  over the speaker.  Well, Fatso and aisle three  show up. 
[04:01:30]  But I do think they have the  right to to say that if  I have if I purchase a  seat and your big fucking  fat ass is in my seat, I  have every right to be  angry about that, just  like you have every right  if I'm drinking and  fucking put my face in  your seat to be bothered  by that.  But see, I think that's  kind of a cost of doing  business.  If you're planning on  close, you know, close  confined travel, you can't  get away from it.  There's going to be people  you don't want to sit  next to.  Right.  Well, then how about you  accept the cost of doing  you start doing the  airlines if you get  some turbulence? 
[04:02:00]  How about this?  How about the cost of  doing business for  continue to feeding your  addiction and to  continuing to not get  help is that sometimes  you've got to pay more  on the airline.  Why should everybody  else take the hit?  Why don't you take the  hit?  Why isn't the cost of  business on you?  Does that mean that you  don't think you're denied  travel?  No, not at all.  That's what it boils down  to a lot of times is you  have to get from point A to  point B.  Oh, well, we don't have  two seats for you, so  you're screwed.  So you would rather have  people around you  inconvenienced instead of  you being inconvenienced 
[04:02:30]  when it's your addiction?  Are you that self-centered?  No, but that's part of  life.  Oh.  People inconvenience you  all the time.  People cut you off.  Sure.  People sit you.  People burp at you.  I mean, it's part of the  deal.  Sure.  Their inconvenience is a  part of life.  Your inconvenience, even  though you're the one  contributing to your own  addiction.  But do you think it's  comfortable for somebody  that big being jammed  into that little seat  trying to squish away  from the person next to  him?  No, but I think that  person should address  their own addiction.  Listen to yourself.  You're everything.  Chrissy, you're making 
[04:03:00]  every anti-fat person  point I've ever made  is exactly in what  you're saying.  You have just reinforced  every irritation I've  ever had.  What you say, I feel  zero empathy for you.  But that's because you  haven't been.  Don't tell me why I feel  a certain way.  That's not why it is.  If you were an  alcoholic, Chrissy, I'm  going to hang up on you  to keep talking.  You would be different.  Bullshit.  If you were talking 
[04:03:30]  right now about  drinking, and I drink  and why can't I be  fucking loud on the  plane?  That's life.  I would be disgusted  with you.  Don't tell me that's why  because I'm not fat.  You're not saying  something that people  don't understand.  Well, it's a passive  thing.  It's not an aggressive  active in-your-face  I'm doing this to  piss you off.  It's who and what  people are.  Okay, hey, you keep  feeding that addiction  and you keep fucking  blaming everybody else  for reacting to it.  We have to go because  we are actually out of  time.  I apologize to  Ron and Fez for  going late.  So Chrissy, thank you 
[04:04:00]  for the enraging phone  call, but I will say  that you have made me  everything you said  was every reason I  criticize people who  are overweight.  Zero responsibility  responsibility for your  own shit.  Take responsibility for  yourself.  And if it was drinking  and drugs, I'd say the  same thing.  When my addiction  affects other people,  then fuck me.  It's my fault.  It's my responsibility.  All right.  Well, thank you  everybody for the  call.  We have a full phone  line. 
[04:04:30]  I apologize to all  the people we didn't  get to.  I'm sure Twitter really  loved her.  But you know what?  It's fucking enraging  this woman.  How irritating.  But I'm happy she  lost the weight.  Good for her.  All right, guys, I  will see you tomorrow.  Stay around for Ron  and Fez.  Jim Norton is now  done dealing with  your bullshit.
