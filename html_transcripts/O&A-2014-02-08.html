<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a nostalgic trip down memory lane, discussing Radio Shack's demise, its quirky commercials, and popular albums and video games from the 80s and 90s like *Jagged Little Pill*, *Ten*, *Metal Health*, *Dookie*, Zaxxon, and Asteroids.  One host claimed to have been pictured in the local paper next to Ozzy Osbourne biting the head off a bat on Super Bowl Sunday 1981, a day he spent playing Asteroids for ten straight hours.  Their reminiscing continued with tales of childhood mischief, including writing bad checks (one to buy a girl a gold chain at Macy's), shoplifting candy, stationery, and Playboy magazines, and even stealing meat from a supermarket.  They detailed their intricate baseball card games and fondly recalled their remote-controlled cars, dubbed "doom buggies."  They then previewed upcoming segments, including an interview with Russ and Paola from *90 Day Fiancé* and appearances by Lady Di and Marion.

Lady Di called to cancel her appearance because Marion was unwell, leading to a heated discussion and threats from the hosts to remove both from future shows.  This was interspersed with calls from Leon, expressing interest in the "Super Show," and a discussion of a Tom Sizemore story alleging Bill Clinton's involvement with Elizabeth Hurley.  A McDonald's Canada video debunking a viral image of "pink goo" in chicken McNuggets was then played, prompting further humorous commentary.

The next segment focused on Chicken McNuggets, using the McDonald's Canada video to detail their production, highlighting the chicken skin content. This transitioned into a phone call with Pow and Russ from *90 Day Fiancé*.  The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive banter with Pow, commenting on her appearance and her interactions with Russ and his religiously conservative family.  Russ joined the conversation, fielding questions about their relationship, the show's editing, and the K-1 visa process.  The hosts revealed they knew the couple was already married, despite the show's storyline.  This was followed by more sexually explicit jokes and a brief mention of their podcast and its listener numbers.  A discussion of Mia Farrow, Roman Polanski, and Woody Allen ensued, leading to another conversation with Lady Di, who initially declined but then accepted an appearance the next day,  all punctuated with sexually explicit jokes and comments.  The segment ended with the hosts viewing and commenting on celebrity nude photos on Twitter.

The following segment was a chaotic phone call extravaganza centered around Lady Di and her erratic behavior.  Her roommate, Bill, described his wealthy but unemployed lifestyle.  Calls followed from Derrick, who detailed witnessing Lady Di vomiting outside a Burger King, and Frenchy, who engaged in a heated argument with Lady Di filled with insults and accusations about Bill's sexual activities.  A humorous misunderstanding occurred with a caller who mistakenly believed they were speaking with Bill.  Lady Di eventually confirmed her appearance on the next day's "Super Show," leading to further discussion of the show's plans, including multiple female guests (with explicit hopes for nudity), a mysterious celebrity guest, the potential appearance of Bobo, and nude-themed games.  Who Kid then joined, recounting a fantastical story about a Super Bowl party involving Seahawks players, P. Diddy, and other rappers, whose veracity the hosts questioned.  The segment concluded with more planning for the "Super Show," focusing on the female guests and their expected behavior, along with final advertisements.

A later segment featured a conversation with an unnamed guest about Deepak Chopra, discussing his claims of divinity, use of the term "quantum," and whether he genuinely believed his teachings or was exploiting pseudoscience for profit.  A humorous anecdote about Chopra's son exposing his father sleeping during a supposed meditation session was shared. The conversation broadened to Richard Dawkins, debates with creationists, the nature versus nurture debate, and the prevalence of "psychotic personality traits" among comedians.  The hosts discussed comedy styles, audience interaction, the decline of quality television due to advertiser influence, and compared this to the dystopian portrayal of technology in *Black Mirror*. They also discussed the differences between cable television and streaming services.  The segment was interspersed with commercial breaks for Rent-A-Center, ProFlowers, Optima Tax Relief, California Coast University, GetARoom.com, Borrow.com, and Vistaprint.

Finally, a segment consisted entirely of advertisements for Instaflex (with Chuck Woolery), Smart Mouth, Jim Ladd's Deep Tracks, Adam & Eve (with a Valentine's Day promotion), It's Just Lunch, and Williams and Williams real estate.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  He's in gold pants, a black shirt, he's got kind of an afro.  Can't tell. The Hulkster, though, look at him.  Again, Mary LeRetton.  Now they're running out of the store.  In a DeLorean.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Little reference there.  Teen Wolf goes into a DeLorean?  Whoa, that is weird.  That is pretty fucked up.  Oh, take off.  It's time for a new Radio Shack.  What does that mean? 
[00:00:30]  Are they going to finally build a real store?  They're finally going to have what I want.  Yeah, they're trying to.  I've never gotten an item there that I needed.  Nothing.  It's just a bad store.  It was always a sad place.  Very sad.  It just was sad when you went in there.  Radio Shack was sad.  Their stuff looked, because I don't feel like getting sued, looked cheaply made.  Every single thing in there just looked cheaply made.  Yeah.  Back in the old, old days, though, Radio Shack was the place to go to buy capacitors, resistors,  transistors, and circuit boards, and just schematics, and you'd solder together your own shit, you 
[00:01:00]  know?  Not all of us.  That was kind of what it was there for.  Oh, not all of us?  No.  That's your thing.  Okay.  Good for you, bud.  That's a little geeky kid.  Yeah.  But then you go into Radio Shack, and you couldn't even find that stuff anymore.  You'd find cheap, knockoff versions of radio-controlled cars and shit like that.  It was horrible.  Are they doing the same bit, trying to figure out all the people from the Radio Shack commercial?  No.  I'm looking to see if anybody made a list, but I don't see one yet. 
[00:01:30]  By the way, people are saying Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill was an album everyone had to have.  A lot of people did that.  Pearl Jam's 10.  Who else?  Quiet Riot meant the Metal Health.  Everyone had to have that?  No.  I know I did.  There's some good songs on there, but I don't think everyone had to have it.  Slim Goodbody.  That was his name.  Who is that?  I don't remember Slim Goodbody.  Yeah, he was like on a Saturday morning educational show. 
[00:02:00]  He would educate your body with that bodysuit thing.  Okay.  It's just a solid gold dancer.  Oh, a solid gold dancer chick.  Oh, yeah.  No wonder that nobody showed him.  The ectoplasm.  We didn't see Slimer.  We didn't see Slimer in the Radio Shack.  Because he cut up the commercial at the end.  He comes through the wall and goes, yeah, you missed it.  Q-Bert?  I missed Q-Bert.  I didn't see Q-Bert.  I hate Q-Bert.  Q-Bert.  I hate Q-Bert, too.  Q-Bert's a douche.  He really was. 
[00:02:30]  I think the other guy must have been another solid gold dancer.  You think?  I think so.  Oh, he had gold pants.  That's exactly what I'm basing that theory on.  Solid gold.  Wow.  And Green Day's Dookie.  People have it.  Oh, yeah.  That was definitely an album.  Yeah.  Dookie, yes.  Yeah.  You ever heard of the album Dookie?  Oh, no.  You know all the songs.  It was the biggest album ever.  That's great.  I haven't heard of it.  Dookie.  That's not the biggest album ever.  It's not.  When I was in sixth grade, it was.  Exactly.  It was a horrible game.  Zaxxon.  It was huge.  It was Zaxxon. 
[00:03:00]  I remember that.  Zaxxon.  They tried to be like, look, it's 3D.  And they tried Zaxxoff after.  Waxxon.  It was very difficult to play.  Because it was supposed to be in 3D, but it wasn't.  And it cast a shadow.  And you could never get the altitude right.  It was horrible.  Remember how bad 3D graphics were in fucking 1984?  They were really bad, yeah.  And you were in the diner.  And you could smoke.  And it would be that black mark on the video game.  Right.  Because people were putting their cigarettes on the fucking video game. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I would get shocked.  The Asteroids thing would shock me sometimes when I was playing.  Really?  Because it would wear down.  The metal would be exposed.  I would get shocked all the time playing Asteroids.  Whoa.  And you wound up still transcending your shock pain and becoming the Asteroids champ.  I wasn't the champ.  What?  I just played well.  Oh.  That was in the paper locally.  Yeah.  You remember the little.  Super Bowl Sunday.  49ers Bengals.  Yeah.  That was when it was.  81. 
[00:04:00]  So you missed a game because you were playing one big game of Asteroids?  10 hours.  Yes.  And straight hours.  And that was when Ozzy bit the head off the bat.  And that's why his picture's in the paper.  And I'm one picture over.  That's right.  But fast forward.  Ozzy's thanking you.  That's crazy.  Oh, yeah.  You still tweet the Black Sabbath.  I was so happy.  That is crazy.  What was that on?  That was from their.  They have a DVD release called Gathered in Their Masses.  And they're thanking Jimmy.  You fast forward.  Well, I'm on the DVD.  I'm interviewing them on their DVD.  That's so fucking cool.  Oh, man.  Extra.  You know how it is.  Guy just hangs out with his pals.  That's awesome. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  That was pretty cool.  Did you play pinball?  Old school pinball before they.  No, I never liked pinball.  I liked the old machines before they really fancied them up with all that shit where you could  get 10 million points and it doesn't mean anything.  And remember the, remember the, the, the knock when you got a free ball?  Free ball.  And you hear that.  You get that loud knock on wood telling you that you got a free ball.  You're like, yes.  That was always like, fuck.  That's, that was a great sound to hear.  Yeah.  I used to go to the miniature golf course on the corner of Elwood Road and Jericho Turnpike. 
[00:05:00]  I used to play that golf course.  Yeah.  It was like a little miniature golf course.  And then they, they had a whole big line of pinball machines go down there, pocket full  of quarters and ding, ding, ding, ding.  Just play pinball.  Too bad you didn't have Posey in your pocket.  Remember just, remember just having a heavy pocket full of quarters?  That was a good day.  Like, I got my pocket full of quarters. 
[00:05:30]  Playing some pinball.  We played at the bowling alley in Huntington.  Remember when Huntington had a bowling alley?  Uh, not Larkfield Lanes.  No, right in town.  Now it's that supermarket.  I don't know.  Oh.  Yeah.  I went to Larkfield Lanes.  Right across from the movie theater, basically.  Until I wrote in that bad check.  You're Derryborn.  Derryborn?  Derryborn.  Derryborn.  Derryborn.  What do you mean you wrote a bad check?  I, I, I said this once before.  The guy at Larkfield Lanes is really nice.  And, um, Larkfield Lanes. 
[00:06:00]  Larkfield Lanes.  That's a biggie.  We've all been to Larkfield Lanes.  I think it's still there, even.  And I, uh, I wrote, I wrote a $25 check.  And I was like, could you cash this, please?  He goes, yeah, okay, no problem.  I could tell he doesn't do this and stuff.  And he cashed it.  And I knew I didn't have any money in my account.  Ah.  What'd you buy with it?  Uh, I don't know.  Probably cigarettes and fucking...  Ice cream sandwiches.  Yodels.  Yeah.  Yodels.  Yodels and, uh, cigarettes.  I hate to have to make out with you. 
[00:06:30]  Yodels and cigarette breath.  That's not what you said in the bathroom before.  That's because you don't have yodels on your dick.  And I had to avoid Larkfield Lanes for the longest time.  And sometimes I'd see him walking down Larkfield Road, and I'd have to, like, I'd have to pull  a Louie Beans.  I'd have to run away.  You bummed him out, man.  Anthony Beans.  You just bummed that guy out.  I did bum him out.  He lost faith in... 
[00:07:00]  You were a bummer.  He lost faith in the youth.  In the youth of America.  Yeah.  I used to, uh, I used to pass a few bad checks in my day.  Wow, that's brave.  Passed it, one at Macy's, so I could get a girl a fucking present, because I figured  if I didn't get her a present, she'd leave me.  You know?  What was the occasion?  I don't even think it was any occasion.  I think it was just Anthony has to get this girl, he has to buy her something so she would  like him.  What a dick bag.  What'd you get her?  Some stupid gold chain, of course. 
[00:07:30]  Some fucking tinfoil gold chain.  That I wrote a bad check for.  Did she leave you?  Of course she did.  How much was the, uh, bad check for?  I think it was for 200 bucks.  Wow.  Jesus.  I passed a bad check for 200 bucks.  I didn't have the balls to do that.  I was too scared.  They didn't have a lot of the, uh, shit they have now where they could, you know, check  it on an instant, uh, if you have money in your account.  So they just kind of believed you.  As long as you had your ID and all that shit, they just had to believe that you weren't passing 
[00:08:00]  a bad fucking check.  Remember how easy shoplifting used to be?  Oh, what a fucking...  You can't get away with that shit now.  Cameras everywhere now.  Shoplifting was easy.  You just waited for the clerk to just be on another part of the store.  I never shoplifted.  I stole some candy and stuff from, like, this stationery, but never, like, clothes.  I never went big.  And most of mine was stationery shit.  Baseball cards, candy.  Yeah, it's the only place I really stole from was the stationery.  And the famous Playboy magazine.  Man, if you got caught with a Playboy, though, that was a double whammy. 
[00:08:30]  You're stealing and you're a fucking pervert.  I remember being in the stationery store, watching the mirrors, just waiting and waiting  for my opportunity.  And the guy finally, like, I was the only person in the store who got bored and went in the  back quickly or tore the back.  And I took the Sprint for Freedom with that Playboy, man.  Oh, my God.  And I had that for, like, years, that particular Playboy.  I used to do the move where I'd do the slow walkout. 
[00:09:00]  And I would stop at the door and be like I was interested in something.  Because I wanted him to think, like, well, if he was stealing something, he'd be running  out of here, not sauntering to the doorway.  That takes balls.  It was a good strategy.  You've got to keep your cool.  You've got to keep your cool.  You can't crack under that pressure.  Oh, there would be no way I would be able to do that move.  Yeah.  No fucking way.  And you had to pretty much know he didn't see you doing it.  Right.  You know?  So, but I always thought if I made it look too obvious, like I was walking out. 
[00:09:30]  I still, to this day, do that move out of some type of guilt.  When I go into someplace, realize very quickly they don't have what I need.  So I turn around and leave right away.  Then people say, come back, Anthony.  It's your first meeting.  It's going to be okay.  They don't have what I need.  Very good.  Yeah.  I think we all have that guilt.  I would turn around and just like, I would stop at the door again and be like, look at me.  I wouldn't be stopping if I stole from you. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I think we all have that guilt leaving stores.  Yeah.  When you don't buy anything.  You have this weird thing in your head.  Like, you almost feel guilty of something.  Like, fuck, will you relax?  You didn't, there's nothing going on here.  Just leave the stupid store.  The stupid supermarket where you still got to walk through the fucking checkout thing to get the fuck out.  Right.  And then you feel all like, uh, uh, nothing for me today.  Yeah.  Stealing was so much fun, though.  It was more of the thrill.  I might have been in the back office of a supermarket back in the day. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, no.  Getting a talking to.  Getting a talking to.  Getting a talking to.  What were you stealing from a supermarket?  I can't make shit up.  Meat like Boone and fucking.  I think it was like meat or something.  Yeah.  The basic shit.  I'm trying to remember.  Nothing for me today, thanks.  Yeah, exactly.  Boone and Flounder.  But I didn't call anyone.  I just had a, I just had a talking to.  He's shoving the meat in his thing.  He's like, we could get in trouble for this.  He goes, that's right. 
[00:11:00]  That's right.  Yeah, good talking to in a back horrible office.  Oh.  They put the light on you.  Asked to never return.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They didn't call the cops, though?  No, I swear.  Now they call the cops.  I think they now fucking do all that shit.  Call the fucking cops.  The cops show up.  Put the cuffs on the kids.  Try to scare them straight, you know?  Yeah.  Don't be stealing kids.  Oh, like I said, it's harder now with all the cameras.  Oh, my God.  There was no cameras.  Yeah.  You just had to be smart about it. 
[00:11:30]  I don't even remember how I got caught, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  No.  That's one of those memories that, unfortunately, is fading away.  There was also the move where you could still, I remember the stationery store had a very  high counter in it.  And if you did buy something, and this is a ballsy move, because you had to look the  guy right in the fucking eye while he's ringing it up.  And use your hands.  You just grab gum.  Yeah.  And shove it right in your pocket while you're looking at him.  Well, that was the move.  You sacrifice some of your money to get more.  Right.  Right.  So you'd be talking to him.  He's ringing it up.  Right.  And you're just grabbing chiclets and shoving them in your pocket. 
[00:12:00]  When you were sure there was no way he knew that you were grabbing stuff.  He's not suspecting me.  Then you finally bought something.  Right.  So now you're like, hey, everyone's good here.  I bought something.  Hey, see?  Baseball cards.  See you later.  Oh, man.  Was that a treat, too?  Opening up a new pack of baseball cards.  Shitty gum.  Stupid shit.  Yeah.  I loved the shitty gum.  They never figured out the baseball card gum.  It had such a great flavor for .03 seconds.  Yeah.  I would just suck out the goodness. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  It wasn't worth chewing.  Fell apart like Lot's wife.  Very good.  And then, oh, it sucked when you bought the cards, though, and there were doubles in there  or shit you had already.  Right.  Yeah.  How much did you hate that when you got, like, two Ted Williams?  Oh, yeah.  It sucked.  Mahonis Wagner.  Yeah.  And then I would flip baseball cards with people at school and lose all the time. 
[00:13:00]  I was the worst flipper.  Fucking.  They'll flip you.  What?  Colors.  How'd you flip?  What is it?  Colors.  There were colors.  So you'd flip for colors.  There was arguments over the colors sometimes, because there would be a couple colors it  could have been.  Yeah, but it was always the red, green, fucking yellow.  It's your basic primaries and shit.  The blue.  But then you flipped teams.  If you flipped teams, that went on forever.  It was a giant stack when someone finally won. 
[00:13:30]  And I remember I'd be shaking.  What do you mean flip teams?  It was like my fucking elementary school version of blackjack.  What do you mean flip teams, though?  You'd do the same thing as if someone flips and matches the color, they would take it.  You'd have to wait until, like, here comes fucking Yankees.  Yankees.  Oh, we never did that.  And now you'd take the stack.  It would build up huge.  Right.  It was a huge jackpot right there.  I used to get sad, because I liked my baseball cards.  I had no business flipping.  Flip you five.  Flip you five.  And it was five cards.  You'd have a little limit. 
[00:14:00]  Right, right.  One, two, three, four, five.  Remember?  No, it would be like, dink, dink, dink, dink.  No, no.  We would go one, two, three, four, five.  There would be five cards on the flip.  No, you'd just take five, and you'd flip one at a time.  No.  But only five until you'd clean someone out.  And line them up.  No.  One at a time.  You'd go one down, and then someone would flip on top.  And then one down, flip on top.  We would line up our cards, too.  Like, here's my ten, and then you'd go.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  But we'd also do flip five, where you would count five, you know, and then it would be 
[00:14:30]  five cards going down.  I don't know.  Wow.  I never did that.  That's crazy.  That's some Harbourfield shit right there.  That's stupid shit.  That's some Greenlawn shit.  You motherfuckers will always fucking shit up.  Elwood.  Elwood, nigga.  Now, what the hell are they going to do?  What, are you going to flip for iPads, for Pete's sake?  I can't do that no more.  Those were the days.  Oh, man.  What, are you going to flip your flat screen, Sammy?  And then last, it's amazing how worthless last year's cards became. 
[00:15:00]  Like, a year would go by, the new year, baseball cards would come out, and last year's cards  were just shit.  You used to chuck them up.  Yeah, I'm going to chuck up my cards.  And you'd grab a big stack and just throw them up in the air.  Sometimes kids would do that with the new cards, and it was like it would cause a frenzy.  In the hallway, just take cards and throw them, and people would be like, wah, like it was money.  Crazy shit.  What a sad upbringing we had.  Aw.  Very suburban. 
[00:15:30]  What the kids have today, and we were excited about baseball cards.  Baseball cards and fucking doom buggy wheelies.  Stupid remote-controlled cars, doom buggies that had a cord attached to it.  Stupid as that.  Little battery pack.  Like, wheeze, wheeze, wheeze, wheeze, wheeze.  You're walking it like a fucking mechanical dog.  It sucked.  Doom buggy wheelies.  Remember Digger the dog?  Digger, yes.  A diggin' he goes with you when you explore.  Just pull his leash.  He's your dog, for sure. 
[00:16:00]  Digger the dog was a cunt.  Digger the dog.  I have the nog version.  Digger the dog.  Digger the dog.  It just never ends.  With that, we're going to take a break, because we've got to get set for our POW interview.  Yes.  And I guess the guy's calling in, too, from 90 Day Fiance.  They're calling from, do you know where they are, right? 
[00:16:30]  They're actually in Pittsburgh.  They live in Pittsburgh.  Wow, do they?  Yeah, well, they said that they should be there February 28th to come see my show.  And if they sit here in Atlantic City the 16th of February, I will be there one show only.  D.C.'s all sold out, guys.  Big shot me.  It is.  I'm looking at the one sheet for the Russ and POW interview, and on February 3rd, she retweeted this picture.  She decided to move on, and she's happy now? 
[00:17:00]  What's that about?  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Her Twitter's weird, because it, I mean, it does not look like she's in the country on her Twitter.  And Russ and POW are calling from separate phones.  Oh.  I guess things didn't work out.  I don't know.  I'm sure they won't fess up to it.  Yeah, because they want people watching the show.  Yeah, they'd be like, oh, you've got to watch the show.  Right.  All right, well, we're going to talk to them within the half hour.  Are we going to try to get Lady Di on the phone?  Because she's trying to back out of Super Show 2. 
[00:17:30]  We're working on it.  She should fucking...  Back out of it with a fucking bullet sandwich.  With a shotgun palate cleanser.  And she wants to take Marion with her.  What the fuck's that about?  And she's rescheduling her own thing.  She's like, no, we're not going to come in.  We're going to come in in March.  Come on, you don't tell us.  Yeah, we're not going to do this in March.  Exactly.  There's no room to march in here.  Oh, gee.  The whole thing was supposed to be for Marion's birthday. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  So she better call the show today.  How old is Marion?  50.  How old is it in pig years?  Opie and Anthony will be right back.  Stay tuned so they don't make fun of your mother.

Not bad for children of the 80s.  Digging through the history? 
[00:27:00]  Here's a 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio gem.  What's the cinnamon challenge?  You've got to give it to him if he really needs it.  It's supposed to be a tablespoon.  Just give him a teaspoon.  Let's see what this does.  We're not going to use the little sprinkle.  That will take nine days to get it on the fucking table.  Nine days.  Ready?  One, two, three, go.  Okay.  Fuck it up.  E-Rock is attempting...  All right, E-Rock? 
[00:27:30]  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is he doing?  You're right, E-Rock.  How is it?  He's like that old wrestler.  Water, you asshole.  Holy shit.  A whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose, fuckface.  You all right?  It's cool.  Jesus. 
[00:28:00]  Breathe water.  Drink water.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  E-Rock.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It does.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  It was a cloud of cinnamon that went across the road.  E-Rock.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up!  Holy shit! 
[00:28:30]  E-Rock, we just want to make sure you're okay.  You can't breathe.  We can breathe.  He's breathing all right.  He's here.  Just slowly.  Very slowly.  You gotta do it.  Slowly.  It's like mustard gas.  Take a little bit of water.  Just a little in your mouth.  A little in your mouth.  Little sit.  Little sit.  Someone get him a napkin.  Are you puking?  We'll just gargle and spit the water out.  Yeah, gargle and spit the water out.  Very slow breaths.  You have to breathe like you're giving birth.  Like that. 
[00:29:00]  Holy shit.  Dude, that was fucking bad.  All right.  Just breathe.  Wow, man.  Just breathe.  What the fuck is that stuff?  I never heard of that.  What does that do?  I can't.  Do you want to do it again?  What's the matter?  I'll let him.  I'll let him.  I'll let him.  I got hurt.  Shut up.  I'm nasty, man. 
[00:29:30]  That is bad.  You all right, Iraq?  What a weird reaction that is.  I would never have fucked up.  See, even the water.  He can't drink water because the cinnamon keeps going down.  But you know what?  This is the weird thing is that this cures cancer.  Well, if you do this once, you'll always, no, seriously, you'll be immune to cancer.  Shut up.  Well, once again, it doesn't work.  You can't, you can't do that.  You can't eat cinnamon. 
[00:30:00]  Wait, you know what?  Before we decide, did he really try now?  Shut the fuck up.  Yes, he did.  That cinnamon challenge thing.  Fuck.  That was a scary day.  For real.  That's just brutal.  Absolutely.  Hacking his lungs out.  I'm enjoying the lookbacks. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Always a little fun.  For 20 years with Anthony and 12 with Jimmy.  How many with Jimmy?  14.  Really?  14?  No.  Around 2000.  Around 2000.  Fuck.  14 years with Jimmy.  Holy fuck.  No.  That's a long fucking time.  A little dookie for everybody.  Green Day.  Right?  I can't listen to these guys because they answer impressions. 
[00:31:00]  It's very nasal.  You really fucked it up for everybody.  Yeah.  I tend to do that.  Yeah, I see line nine, Travis.  Let's do it.  Nine, nine, nine.  Oh, God.  By the way, Russ and Pal from 90 Day Fiance will be on our phones in mere minutes.  Lady Di, what's up?  Hi.  How's everything?  We're not going to be in the studio tomorrow.  Okay? 
[00:31:30]  I just want to let you know, and I'm sorry that we disappointed you, but we're not going  to be there tomorrow.  Well, I hope everybody enjoyed Lady Di.  Yeah, she'll never be on our show again.  While she was on the show.  Make sure you tweet her and tell her she'll never be on our show again.  That's it.  I'd appreciate that.  Done.  From the knuckleheads.  That's it.  Got a job for the knuckleheads.  Tell Lady Di she's done.  She doesn't decide.  She will never.  Especially because of her reasoning. 
[00:32:00]  She thinks the weather's going to be bad tomorrow.  Colin took off to be on the show with her.  Right.  Oh, boy.  And she's not going to be here.  The weather.  Didn't she know she could just look at the weather?  It's not going to be bad.  Right.  They said it was going to be bad days ago, and then they figure out, no, it's not going  to be bad.  But she's probably still like, oh, I hear it's going to be a blizzard.  Right.  Because she's so fucking stupid.  And I hear the storm we're supposed to get Sunday's not really going to happen. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, no, a dusting.  We're going to get maybe an inch or two.  Now they're saying it's Nova Scotia that's going to get hammered.  Oh, Nova Scotia.  But they probably knew that the whole time.  Right?  Yeah.  But they didn't let us know until it was obvious to everybody.  Oh, Nova Scotia.  What do you say when the waiter asks you if you'd like some Viscotia?  Nova Scotia.  That's great.  I woke up at one in the morning last night. 
[00:33:00]  I went to bed at like 12, 1230.  So you slept an hour?  Not even.  Oh, God.  And I could not get back to sleep.  And you guys got to leave for Washington today.  Yeah.  For some sold-out shows.  Wow.  Very good.  You're going to sleep in the car?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you do that with Kenny?  I'm debating the train, actually.  Oh, really?  Why?  It's faster.  I want to get to bed.  If I can get in nice and early, I could get a couple hours.  Gotcha.  I thought she would call back, Sam.  We hung up on her when she said she's not going to be here. 
[00:33:30]  And she hasn't called back yet.  Should we try to get her back on?  You want to?  Yeah.  I thought it would be a quick, you know, what happened.  Expand on wine?  Yeah.  Big hullabaloo.  What's Viscotia?  A Viscotia?  Yeah.  Viscotias are really good.  No.  It's a combination of, it's a knish with a celery stalk, peanut buttered on top of it  like a tree.  Oh.  A Viscotia.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, then I understand why people would say Nova Scotia.  Well, you can't. 
[00:34:00]  You've eaten too many Viscotias.  People usually snack on them.  It sounds awful.  It's delicious.  All right.  She's calling back.  Ah.  Oh, good.  Lady Diet.  What happened?  Nothing.  The phone's cut out on your end.  Okay.  So, what were you saying?  No, we're not going to be at the show tomorrow.  Marion's not feeling good.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, but the whole thing is, next week is her birthday.  Okay?  So, this was supposed to be Marion's birthday party, right? 
[00:34:30]  This fucking moron.  Yeah.  It was supposed to be Marion's birthday.  Go ahead.  And, you know, I don't think it would be right for me to go on the show without her.  What?  You did it last time.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  That was fine.  So, we won't celebrate her birthday, then?  Right.  It's not a birthday, then.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Well, you know.  She was coming in for her birthday as a little thing, but if she can't make it, we still have  a show to do.  Yeah.  Why don't you come in tomorrow? 
[00:35:00]  We weren't revolving.  The show wasn't about Marion's birthday.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I have to discuss it with her.  Why can't you come in tomorrow?  Yeah.  Without anything having to do with Marion, why can't you show up tomorrow?  Go.  You know, I knew you guys were going to say that.  All right?  It would not be right for me to go up there by myself when it's being close to her birthday. 
[00:35:30]  Why?  Why?  It's not her birthday show.  That makes no sense.  It has nothing to do with her birthday.  We would barely mention it.  All right.  We'll have to see what happens.  See?  No, no, no.  We have to plan ahead.  Right.  We can't just see what's going to happen.  We will be so disappointed that we absolutely will not have you on the show anytime soon  if you don't show up tomorrow.  Guy, there is a major celebrity who's a friend of the show that's coming in tomorrow specifically 
[00:36:00]  to meet you.  Yeah.  Who?  Okay.  And that's true.  Who said?  Who?  I can't say who it is.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Marion said we're going to be up there sometime in March.  No, it's tomorrow he's coming.  No.  Yeah.  You're coming tomorrow or you're not going to be on this show anytime soon.  Period.  Because we have a sponsor and everything.  Oh, boy. 
[00:36:30]  I mean, right now, what you're doing is I'm between you guys and my best friend.  You can come on.  That's a huge distance between us.  That's a pig in a hard place.  I think we're closer to the sun.  Yeah.  You can come on and wish her a happy.  You can sing a happy birthday to her on the air.  Yeah, maybe we'll give her a phone call or something.  Okay.  All right. 
[00:37:00]  Why won't you?  You have to come in.  That's all there is to it.  We've planned things.  You're coming in in March, though, right?  Jimmy.  Well, yeah.  In March.  No, tomorrow.  No.  You will not be here in March.  I can guarantee that.  Okay.  Well, then she'll be there in March.  No, she will not be either.  We're going to take you both out.  Take us out where? 
[00:37:30]  Fucking home run die.  I'm only kidding.  Can I call you back?  Why?  You're going to work it out with Marion, right?  Yeah, I'm going to try to.  You're training bed bugs to do tricks?  Yeah.  How are the bed bug bites?  There is no bed bugs anymore in this place.  That's good to hear.  Don't worry about it.  There isn't any.  Believe me.  She'll track them into the studio.  Trust me.  And how many Natty Ices have you had so far?  How many?  All right.  All right. 
[00:38:00]  This is my third one.  Uh-huh.  When I was talking to you last night.  It's 840 in the morning.  When I was talking to you last night on Twitter, how many had you had at that point?  Oh, I don't know.  After a while, I don't count them, Sam.  Uh-huh.  Are we thinking like five or are we thinking like 15?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Somewhere around there.  Somewhere around where?  15, you said?  Yeah.  Pretty close. 
[00:38:30]  Pretty close.  Jesus.  I don't know how many I had.  That's just good.  I don't know.  All right.  You call up Marion and you've got to call us back before the end of today's show.  Okay.  I will.  And if the answer is you're not coming, then I don't know what to tell you.  And that's bad news for you and Marion if you don't come.  She's going to have to suffer those consequences as well.  If we can't depend on you guys, we're not going to plan on having you in.  Yeah.  We're going to take both of you out because we have a sponsor. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  You can't tell me who the sponsor is.  The sponsor is Steven Singer.  Who?  Steven Singer.  Steven Singer.  Do you listen to our show?  He's a jeweler.  He's our only sponsor, basically.  He wants you here in March.  He said you can come in March.  We got him and a razor guy.  That's about all we have for our advertising here.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'll try to give her a call, but I'll explain to her the whole situation, and we'll  see what happens. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  The situation is this.  We weren't throwing Mary in a dumb birthday party.  We probably would have said, oh, that's right.  It's your birthday soon.  Happy birthday.  But it's just the super show.  Right.  Why are you calling it the super show?  Because we're inviting everybody.  Oh, my God.  Inviting everybody like who?  Like you.  Do you remember the last time we did this a mere few weeks ago?  Yeah.  I remember.  You were here.  All right.  We're doing that again, kind of.  With different things.  Is Sammy and Patty going to be there, too? 
[00:40:00]  Yes.  Yes.  In March.  No, tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  In March.  Well, Colin's probably going to be there, right?  He will be there.  Yes.  Yes.  He will be here.  He only flew to Colorado today for a gig.  He will be there.  Yeah.  He's flying back just to do the show, and then he's going to go back to Colorado.  Oh.  Well, the thing is, though, Marion.  Tell Marion.  Listen.  It's her birthday party tomorrow.  Listen to me.  Tell Marion this is what's happening.  Colin flew to Colorado today.  He's doing shows tonight in Colorado. 
[00:40:30]  Then he's going to fly all the way back to New York to do our radio show tomorrow morning,  because you and Marion are going to be there.  And then he's going to fly all the way back to Colorado to continue his gigs.  Can I go with him?  Colorado.  Yeah.  We'll book a C-130.  Throw you out the back with a big parachute.  Operation.  Yeah.  You seriously want to go to Colorado? 
[00:41:00]  What?  Yeah.  Well, I would like to.  One day.  It's a dream.  It's a dream.  Going to Colorado.  Ratso going to Florida.  One day.  Hold on a second.  Isn't it snowing in Colorado?  Well, what do you think?  Not really.  Not usually in February.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think they get a lot of snow.  Snowing in fucking Honolulu this year.  All right.  Well, let me call her up.  Explain the situation to her.  There's no situation.  Big big birthday party.  What are you going to explain to her, Lady Dot?  And what kind of sickness does she have? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  She just had like a stomach virus or something.  Oh, Jesus.  Imagine her on a toilet.  Oh, my God.  Honey, I need more toilet paper.  Oh, God.  I'm wiping my ass.  It's still fucked up.  She's on a cordless phone like Gordon Gekko used to use.  Just clogging the pipes.  Die.  Die.  Die.  I've got to take you tomorrow.  What?  Die.  What?  What are you going to?  You say you're going to explain the situation to Marion. 
[00:42:00]  What are you going to explain to her?  Coming in in March.  Right.  Yeah.  Work it out with us.  Make believe we're Marion.  How would you explain this?  All right.  All right.  This is what I'm going to say.  Uh-huh.  A lot of people are coming in tomorrow, and they will be very disappointed if at least  I don't show up.  Right.  Right.  Wait.  You've got to say hello.  You're pretending that the show is Marion.  So say, hi, Marion.  What are you doing?  Well, she's...  Actually, right now, she's working. 
[00:42:30]  We're role...  No, no, no.  Listen.  Dumbest person ever.  We're role-playing.  Yeah, write that.  You can't.  We're role-playing.  You're pretending that we're Marion.  So I'm saying, pretend that we're Marion.  Say, hey, Marion.  What are you doing?  Hey, Marion.  What are you doing?  Oh, just rooting around in my own shit in a pen.  Oh, please stop it, Jimmy.  Come on, Paul.  Come on.  Root.  My owner's got me out looking for truffles.  Hold on. 
[00:43:00]  We got Leon on the phone.  He hasn't called in a while.  Hey, Leon.  Yo, what's up, man?  I was wondering if I can come to that party you got tomorrow.  The Super Show.  Yeah, you sure can, Leon.  I would love to come down there.  And why are you guys always ragging on that dude on the phone there?  You fucking dopey bitch.  It's me.  Is it snowing in Colorado?  What do you think, you dopey fucking man? 
[00:43:30]  You are the stupidest fucking man around, okay?  Colin doesn't want anything to do with you.  He's not bisexual.  Okay.  Very good.  He doesn't want anything to do with me.  All right.  Whatever.  What can I tell you?  Then why do you want to go to Colorado?  Breaking her hot.  Oh, yeah.  I was just joking when I said that.  No, you want to suck his dick.  You're not a comic.  You're a stupid man.  Yeah, whatever. 
[00:44:00]  Whatever.  You can suck your fucking mouth and fucking keep your dick in your pants and leave my friend  Colin alone.  Okay.  Okay.  I will.  Okay.  There he goes.  Bullied very easily.  Thank you, Leon.  Leon doesn't speak for all of us, Lady Di.  Yeah, Lady Di, you got to come in.  It's unfortunate Marion can't come in.  And we'll reschedule where Marion could also come in, maybe in March, but you have to  be here tomorrow.  You have to be here.  We have sponsors and everything.  And maybe Marion will start feeling better when she realizes that if she doesn't come 
[00:44:30]  in, she'll never be on the show again.  Right.  I'll see what I can do.  All right.  Call us back.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  So stupid.  That was classic.  Hey, all right.  Now, we're Marion.  Ask, what are you doing?  Hey, Marion, what's up?  No, she's at work.  She's just, she's frighteningly stupid.  Oh, is she a dummy? 
[00:45:00]  Yes, she is.  Just a dolt.  We got Tom Sizemore.  What?  I didn't, did you think Tom Sizemore was sober when he came in here, Jimmy?  I didn't know that day.  You never know.  I always try to get people.  I would say no.  I just don't know.  I would say.  I think he's still having a very, very tough time with his addiction.  But I guess he was telling everyone that Elizabeth Hurley slept with Bill Clinton.  He dated her, I think.  He dated her?  I think he had a three-year fling with her.  His book was very good.  Oh, you're talking about Tom Sizemore. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But Tom Sizemore said that President Clinton.  Yeah, he said he set it up.  That he set it up.  Tom Sizemore said he set it up and that, yeah, and Bill Clinton had a sex romp with  Elizabeth Hurley.  It was tapes that came out of Tom Sizemore telling a group of friends this story.  Who taped one of his friends, his, you know, quote-unquote friends while he was doing drugs.  Oh, really?  And he said it was done before 2010, but then Radar is saying it was done in January. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, wow.  Like this year.  That's what Radar Online, I think, was saying.  Well, now Sizemore is saying this today.  Tom, first of all, this is a pretty incredible story filled with pretty incredible details  in the telling of it.  Is it true?  No, it's not true.  I was never at the White House.  I never met Bill Clinton.  Have you ever been to the White House at all?  I went to a...  He just said he was never at the White House.  Anyone else hear that?  Of course.  But have you ever went to the White House at all?  Do you know Bill Clinton? 
[00:46:30]  Uh...  Boy, it looks like some people got to Tom Sizemore.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Knock it off.  I was never there.  You idiot.  Have you ever been to the White House at all?  I went to a screening of Black Hawk Down, but it wasn't in the White House.  It was a theater near the White House.  But I've never been to the White House to meet a chief or president, any president.  Wow.  He's nervous.  Where does this story come from?  Um...  Well...  I'm not denying that I said these things. 
[00:47:00]  I don't remember saying them, but...  It's an old videotape, and they're the rantings of a guy, and it's been well chronicled, that  had a very severe drug problem, and, um...  That's, um...  Although I said none of it is true.  Yeah.  Uh...  When was this audio recorded?  Um...  It's old tape.  I'm not sure.  I didn't willingly...  I wasn't willingly videotaped, but those were the kind of folks I was hanging around with. 
[00:47:30]  Back before I went to Celebrity Rehab.  Cool, fun people.  Started straightening out my life.  On the death show?  Before he went on the death show.  I forgot he was on the Celebrity Death Show.  Yeah.  That's when he turned his life around.  Right.  Can we see that tape?  It's only audio, and it's kind of long and rambling.  I am.  I'd like to hear a little of it.  Maybe hear a little Tom Sizemore all fucked up.  Does it sound fucked up?  A little.  Maybe we could get clips of that.  Get one of our guys behind the scenes to grab a few clips of that. 
[00:48:00]  What do you think?  Do a little clip grabbing.  Yeah.  Yeah, grab some of them clips.  Yeah.  By the way, people are pointing out that Marion's sick, but she's at work today.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, right.  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  Ah-huh.  If she's...  Ugh.  Just...  Lady Di is Lady Lye.  She is one of the biggest fucking bullshit artists. 
[00:48:30]  She's constantly fibbing.  She loves telling fibs.  Out of school?  Out of school.  Stories out of school.  Out of school.  She tells tall tales.  Yes, a tall, fat tail.  And she has a small, squiggly one.  She's a pig.  Who ran with that fucking Liz Hurley story, though, like it was real?  Radar.  Why would they do that?  It's believable. 
[00:49:00]  Why wouldn't they say, this guy is fucked up on this tape, but here's what he said.  Right.  Instead of, did they report it like Bill Clinton...  They said, Tom Sizemore says...  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Hurley's ex-lover caught on bombshell audio recording revealing ex-president's White House  sex romps behind wife Hillary's back.  See, that isn't ramblings of an addict say that Bill Clinton fucked Liz Hurley. 
[00:49:30]  Well, adjust the headline a little bit.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  A little bit, huh?  I would like to adjust the headline.  Comedian says that Liz Hurley had sex with Bill Clinton, and if she wants to disprove  it, she must sit on Comedian's face and grind a little.  That will straighten everybody out.  All right.  Do we have the video of the pink goo?  Yes.  Well, no, not the pink goo.  The real way McDonald's chicken nuggets are made, you mean. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, what?  That other video's the fake way?  Yeah, McDonald's Canada put out a video that shows how chicken nuggets are made.  Right.  For real.  Yeah.  So, the video with the pink goo that most of us have seen.  Well, we've seen that photo, and that kind of...  Yeah, they say that...  That's all bullshit.  That's all bullshit.  Malarkey.  Okay.  Malarkey is the term I was looking for.  All right.  Let's see how chicken McNuggets are made.  Turn the screen.  Hot.  Hot screen.  Who's this bitch?  Why would you call her a bitch? 
[00:50:30]  I don't know.  She has a big, giant moon face.  Oh, she's horrible.  She looks like she should be holding a Star Wars blaster.  Sports fan?  Yeah, maybe.  Did he make the cut?  He's still here.  Oh, nice.  I like him.  And more cuts recently.  He's a good guy.  Budget cuts.  That's serious.  I feel bad for the dudes that lost their jobs.  Seems like they have enough money around here.  And who are we to judge?  If he wants to fucking bang that Star Wars girl. 
[00:51:00]  Who cares?  If you want to stick your dick in a three, knock yourself out.  Knock yourself out.  I'm going to fuck a keyhole.  If you want to ruin your life over a three.  Things I'd rather fuck than her.  There's a long list.  Snapping turtle mouth.  Hubcap.  Fucking hubcap.  Kenyan mall window during the shooting.  All right, you want to see the McDonald's deal?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, of course.  Sure.  Hi, I'm Nicoletta.  I'm the supply chain manager for McDonald's Restaurants of Canada. 
[00:51:30]  And I'm here today at Cargill in London, Ontario, to answer a question we received from Armad from Edmonton, Alberta.  That cars breathe underwater.  He asks, what are legitimately in McNuggets?  Is there pink goop?  Armad, I'm guessing this is the image that you're referring to.  Oh, that looks delicious.  It's an image that often gets associated with McDonald's.  And it's a question that we get a lot.  We don't know what it is or where it came from, but it has nothing to do with our chicken McNuggets.  Wow.  That just fucked McDonald's.  So that's why we're going to take part of Canada to see how our chicken McNuggets are made.  Once they show us, they're shedding into a batch. 
[00:52:00]  We have a scientist for Cargill, Canada, and she's going to walk us through the process.  Oh, good.  The process.  The process.  They're walking through big doors.  Oh, my God.  We separate all of the chicken cuts and set aside the chicken breast meat for chicken McNuggets.  Chicken breast meat?  On this part of the line, the chicken breast that's been separated is going to like a mention  of this bin.  Oh, I'm going to have a big fat.  The chicken breast that we use in the chicken McNuggets.  So next to the bin, the chicken breast meats are pushed to the blending room. 
[00:52:30]  And we're lifting it up and dumping it into the grinder and adding the ground chicken breast  meat to the blender with some seasonings and some chicken skin.  And then we'll take the mixed chicken meat out of the blender.  So we can see here, here's what it is.  Refer back to the image for Armand.  Here's a big goo image.  It doesn't look much better.  Well, they're saying, I was just saying before I could shut up and ask, they're saying that  this is just chicken breast and some chicken skin in the blender.  Well, they said other ingredients, too.  Spices for seasoning. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  There was no ambiguity there for like chicken gizzards or anything.  Was there a beak?  No, they said breast meat and chicken skin.  But chicken skin makes it incredibly unhealthy.  Yeah.  Chicken skin.  But it's tasty.  They're not saying it.  Do people understand chicken skin is one of the worst things you could eat?  Exactly.  Just because they see it on a chicken.  Well, chicken's good for you.  It seems to be dangerous.  I have a hat made of chicken skin.  Oh, jeez.  It's a delicious hat, but very unsafe.  It's a ski mask. 
[00:53:30]  My face always smells like chicken gizzards.  Jesus.  A little visual for everybody.  Just point at the TV and laugh.  Actually, not for everybody.  For three people.  Yeah.  That looks horrendous, though.  Well, it looks like chicken salad or something without...  It looks like tuna fish.  Yeah.  Like some kind of white fish.  Yeah.  Right, Jimmy.  But it's all right.  We understand what's in there, and there's no real shenanigans going on.  So let's see where it continues at this point. 
[00:54:00]  Sure.  Someone eats it and shits it out.  It's nuggets.  It's called a seasoning and a natural proportion of skins for flavor and as a binder.  But they're not chicken nuggets just yet, so we're going to see how the rest of the  process is made right now.  Process.  In the forming room, the blended chicken meat will be portioned into the four chicken  McNugget shapes called the boot and the bow tie.  And then the chicken McNugget shapes be covered with a light batter and covered by a second  thicker batter called tempura.  So we just hard-fried the nuggets. 
[00:54:30]  We're going to take one off the belt.  When I break it in half, you can see it's raw inside, and it's the same blended meat that  we took out of the blender and took it to the portioner.  So we've just hard-fried it so we can set that batter on it, but the nuggets will be fully  cooked in the restaurants.  That's right.  Now, after the McNuggets are par-fried, they're frozen.  And it's very loud in the packaging room, but we're going to see them bagged, locked,  and prepared for shipping. 
[00:55:00]  Well, we've come to the end of the process.  Thanks for the tour, Dan.  Process.  Come on.  Thanks for the question.  We hope we've answered it.  Damn.  You know what, though?  That's a very smart thing by McDonald's, and that's what companies should do.  That'll go everywhere, too.  Yeah.  Say, hey, at luck.  See?  That'll go everywhere.  Good for them.  I'm going to get some McNuggets today.  With my honey.  They're still horrible for you.  It just seems to be, you know, fucking chicken meat, pressed meat, and some skins.  We have some seasoning.  A little batter.  A little crispy batter.  A little batter called the tempore. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, that sounds like a small guy's up at the plate.  Oh, a little batter.  We've got very good news.  Oh, good.  Oh, what do we got?  We've got a celebrity on the line and some dude.  Pow.  Yo, Pow.  Hello, dear.  Pow.  Oh, hey, I'm here.  Hi, Pow.  How are you?  We're big fans.  You know we're big fans.  Huh?  Oh, I like that.  Oh, yeah.  You're kind of me on the show.  Both.  Oh, we're fans of the show, and of course, fans of you. 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  Of course, let me tell you, you're quite beautiful.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  We're all in with this 90-day fiancé show.  Yeah, it's a great show.  Russ is on the other line.  We'll get to him eventually.  We'll get to him eventually.  Leave it there.  Leave it there.  I'm kidding.  So where are you calling us from?  I'm from Tulsa.  Right now I'm in Tulsa.  I'm in Tulsa.  Tulsa.  Oh, you are in Oklahoma. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, my God.  It's so freaking cold.  Oh, no.  No, no.  I'm just frozen.  Wait, if you're calling for Oklahoma, that means you married the dude.  Uh-oh.  No, I'm not.  Uh-huh.  The 90-day is still running, you know?  The time is running.  I've been here for a short time.  Oh, the time is still running.  The time is still running.  It's not running.  What do you think, you're dealing with amateurs?  That was filmed a while ago. 
[00:57:00]  Wait, what time is it where you are?  Yeah.  It's 8 a.m.  Oh, okay.  8 a.m.  Yeah.  8 a.m.  All right.  And I got to tell you, my favorite part of the whole show, the jacuzzi, the hot tub.  Well, I've been receiving many messages about that.  That, oh my God, that bikini, when you came out in that bikini, and then you take your  towel off, and you're just standing there in front of one of the most disinterested men 
[00:57:30]  in the world.  It was fantastic.  Fantastic.  When someone cares more about his cowboy hat than that luscious body of yours, I must say,  I was a little taken aback.  Right.  It was, let's just say, mysterious.  Right.  Well, that hat, I didn't like it.  No, I didn't either.  No.  It looked good on you, though.  It did look good on you, pal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pal, are those boobies real?  Oh my goodness.  Opie. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, they're real.  If you can see it, yeah, they're real.  We've discussed them at length, and we do believe that those are real boobs.  Like, I don't think they're implants.  Yeah, they're real in their mind.  Oh, wow.  All right.  How was it living with Russ's parents?  Oh, that was really, I don't know, crazy.  They are really nice people.  They seem very nice.  Yeah, they are really nice.  It's just that I don't have the idea that I have to sleep in separate rooms.  It's kind of crazy.  Yes.  You know what?  You have to get to know Russ very well before you marry him, and it was kind of keeping 
[00:58:30]  you guys from knowing each other in more of a biblical sense.  And I do believe he found you a bit icky at times, which is crazy to us, because, I mean,  you're sneaking into his room, and he's like, oh, God, no, you can't be in here.  Right.  My parents' room is right downstairs.  Go back to that other room.  Yuck.  That's crazy.  That was awful.  That was really awful.  That is awful.  And I don't know many men that would chase a girl that's wearing lingerie out of the 
[00:59:00]  room.  Right.  I know a few.  I know a few.  But not many that would do that.  There seems to be a mystery there that why would anyone do that?  Right, right.  I would say fuck religion at that point.  Oh, jeez.  You can't be that into God if you switch.  It's awful.  It's awful.  You haven't seen him in a long end.  What do you want to do?  Just catch up with little things.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was probably going to make some whoopie or something.  Very good. 
[00:59:30]  Very good.  My favorite scene is when you walk downstairs in just lingerie while everyone was getting  breakfast together.  And Russ's mom was not happy about that.  Well, it wasn't lingerie.  It was just something comfortable.  Oh, exactly.  Very comfortable.  You know, let me tell you what I would have done at that point.  I would have invited you to have breakfast on my lap.  Just sit on my lap and let the parents watch as I feed you.  I feed you breakfast. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, that would be awesome.  Yes, two eggs over easy and a fat Italian sausage.  Right.  I would have kicked Russ's parents out of the house.  Exactly.  I would have said, beat it, stupids.  Hey, he's on the line here.  I know, yeah.  It is his parents.  I apologize.  They are his parents.  I apologize.  We've got to start from the beginning, though, with you, pal.  What is this all about?  Did you really, what's the K-1 visa about?  Wait, what's this?  Well, we made the decision because Russ had to go back to the U.S. 
[01:00:30]  and he proposed me.  And he said, well, you know what?  The only way that we can be together in here, in the United States, is that we can apply  for the K-1 visa, the fiancée visa.  But that process, it takes like six to eight months to be approved.  And if you get approved.  And, well, I got approved and I came to the United States and I only have 90 days to get  married.  And if I'm not, I have to go back to Colombia. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, man.  Right.  It's a great concept for a show.  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah.  And how did the TV show come about?  I don't know.  Oh, well, this is, they were, to be honest, I'm not so much about that subject because  Russ was the first one to talk with the TV show and everything.  And they said, if we want to be, if we want to share our story about how we made it and  about the process, the 90 days to get married here. 
[01:01:30]  So I said, well, why not?  It's nice to, we can, it will be nice if we can share how it's displayed in the process.  That bikini was beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we ask Russ some questions?  I guess we'll ask Russ.  We're going to ask Russ some questions.  We're going to put Russ on the phone with you.  Oh, hi, Russ.  Oh, here's the dude.  Here I am.  Oh, boy.  Oh, hi, Russ.  Russ.  How are you, sir?  I don't know.  I've been, the ball's best is what it is. 
[01:02:00]  Well, you've got to understand, Russ, we're, you know, a few guys here.  Yeah, we're men, you know.  And we're looking at your fiancée on the show.  And we really wanted to talk to her because she's very attractive and seems fun and everything  like that.  How do you find Powell?  You like her a lot?  You're in love, actually, with her?  Oh, she's like a dream come true fantasy, you know?  Oh, yeah?  Always had a little thing for a Latino woman.  Oh, you have?  Oh, yeah.  Too bad it's missing a part. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, she's, uh...  But she's very, very beautiful.  Do you worry that other guys might try to take her from you?  No, I trust her.  Oh, yeah?  You ever say to yourself, hey, something's missing here?  Or does the relationship seem full?  Right.  It's spilled.  Don't worry.  Yeah?  Do you think, like, your parents are real, like, religious, right?  Like, do you kind of wish that you didn't, like, listen to it?  Listen to it. 
[01:03:00]  Meaning, like, the religion, like, do you kind of wish that you could have...  Yeah, you have to...  Not listen to the religious stuff as much.  You have to play it your parents' way.  Yeah.  I mean, I respect my parents now.  Sure.  Do I have to follow their rules?  Not necessarily.  Not around...  Not when they're around.  I don't worry about it.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  I get it.  So, congratulations on the marriage.  That's awesome.  Oh, what?  What?  The show's over.  And they got married, right?  Not yet, no. 
[01:03:30]  He's not fessing to anything.  The show's still on.  Yeah, it's still on.  I've seen all the episodes.  Congratulations, Russ and Pow.  What, are we going to make believe we don't know they got married?  Oh, jeez.  What's up?  I don't know.  Keep watching.  I haven't seen them all.  No, I saw all the episodes, because we're big radio stars.  They gave us all the episodes.  The show's still on.  We're lucky.  We'll see.  Maybe they were someone different.  See?  They're like, shut up.  Oh, God, I love Pow and her personality.  She's wonderful.  Yes. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, Russ, how did they approach you for this show?  Who approached you, and how did this show come about?  Right.  Well, as Pow said, we went through the K-1 visa, so I hired an attorney, because there's too  much paperwork, and I didn't want to be dealing with all that.  Didn't want to make the mistake, and then have her waiting again more than six to eight  months.  So the production company contacted the attorney.  The attorney asked if I was interested, and he talked to Pow about it, and he said, let's  go for it. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, we were wondering how they connected with people, I guess, through lawyers that do that  for a living.  Right.  Yes.  Okay.  Very cool.  Have you met any of the other couples?  I have not.  We have not.  How do you feel about the show, portraying you two?  Well, honestly, I think they're missing the point.  They're missing, like, our story behind it, and...  Oh.  Yeah, I think they're missing the point, too.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  There seems to be more going on here. 
[01:05:00]  You think they're using editing and stuff to maybe change things around?  That's what I'm getting at.  Well, you guys, you're in the network.  You're in the...  You know how business goes, so...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, what are you mad about as far as, you know, what they've shown on TV?  Yeah, what did they make look a lot worse than it was?  Um, like, I don't know how honest I can be.  You can be honest.  It's fine.  You can be completely honest, sir.  The show is becoming popular.  Yeah, man.  Everyone's watching. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Like, the living with the parent situation.  Yeah.  How that went down.  Right.  There was not...  It's a little overdramatic on how that went down.  Oh, oh, they made it kind of look like...  Well, was she staying in a separate room and whatnot?  No, that was true.  Oh!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow! 
[01:06:00]  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  Pow!  We have to respect them.  But do you know what?  Well, now that we have our own apartment, that makes it better.  That makes everything better.  You know?  You can get the way you want it and I can work the way I want it around the apartment, even  if I want it.  You know?  Yeah.  Without anything.  Show...  Show off that body of yours.  Oh, well.  Right? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And make it how it's funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:15:30]  that's why we're asking these questions a lot of mystery it's my twitter it's my twitter i want  pictures just my pictures i don't want anyone there it's just me right oh well that's my profile  that's selfish i like russ russ russ could fight back i love it i love it russ is all right  all right kids did we get did we cover all the questions yeah i think so yeah just the question 
[01:16:00]  about uh tulsa world i guess is a big like news oh right right right well they do you guys know  tulsa world or something like that what is that it's a big news website in tulsa they're a newspaper  yeah yeah they just post the marriages local oh they post the marriages oh and oh why well you know  well we'll just leave it at that we don't know  that's out of the bag now isn't it  that's what he certainly has cats out of the bag  oh boy yeah the cat was wait wait oh shit the cat was it couldn't breathe or something 
[01:16:30]  all right wait all right russ so anyway pow how are you everyone's great russ is on hold  oh oh oh you put him on hold i feel so lucky been talking with you guys you gave me so much  so many people yes i was like oh this is some big deal have they been nice yeah well i think like 
[01:17:00]  three or four being like more like day one bikini picture ah yes that was me and me okay  three or four that's people being extra nice yeah they've been really nice they've been really  nice does russ get jealous oh well i don't know are you jealous russ yeah russ russ you get jealous  russ you get jealous at all about uh other guys kind of tweeting your girl and looking at her and  saying things right no i'm not worried about what they have they're not the ones uh 
[01:17:30]  ending the night with her oh well that's true if it's if it's in your if it's in your parents  house neither are you that's what you say i hope that's i hope that's done yeah yeah so if you guys  did get married how long do you have to stay married for oh well no that's the deal if we get  married yeah we want to be with this relationship forever forever posted four months ago but legally 
[01:18:00]  if you were to get married let's just say well the legality at the end of the show if you decide to  get married right uh how how long would you have to stay married to stay in the country legally right  like what like with i'm sure the same is with all couples i'm sure it's something that russ worries  about yeah right russ he has faith in her i'm not worried about it and no there's there's not  anything that we need to worry about now what is the legal you have to go how are you going to be  in a country legal no no what is the legal cutoff like you can't get married no now you're you're a 
[01:18:30]  lot to stay in america because you got married obviously we've read the article so how long do you  have to stay married before you could move on and then stay in the country if that was something  that you choose to god forbid god forbid obviously god forbid this came with you're only allowed to  be in america for three months if you can't make it you have to go back you have to sign papers and  everything so that's why the time is still i'm not in here for 90 days the time i don't i've been here 
[01:19:00]  for a short time that's why the time is still moving so we have to wait and see what happens you  there's no there's no uh guaranteed citizenship either oh okay okay so your conditional green  card right pretty much not a green card a visa oh okay right a visa one visa the fiance visa that's  what i have right now is she uh is she spending all your money not yet not yet well she's got some 
[01:19:30]  expensive tastes though right oh come on well you made her hey you made him buy that apartment  and even russ said hey that my uh checkbook is going to take a beating oh please come on that's  that's network editing oh man oh you got the money yeah all right he's got the money just like the you  know to set the record straight here we can only base it on what we've seen on the show right i have  i have an editing question too when when pal when you met his friends were they really because it 
[01:20:00]  looked like they were uncomfortable with you or was that really a fun time when you met their  friends good question jim norton yeah uh yeah it was a fun time but i think i'm even i'm like  crazier you know okay the reaction to the question was was much different everyone was like yeah we're  ready for some tequila yeah it was right they made it look like and that when you were talking to your  ex-wife about the kids was that like oh that's another couple couple jimmy he doesn't have an  ex-wife that's the one with the filipino broad jimmy no i think it's because the time on tv is 
[01:20:30]  really short that's why you cannot see everything yeah but of course sometimes i have been fine  meeting ross's friend and everything yeah but yeah we're not a good good friend because i didn't  spend time with them right right come on who doesn't like tequila you don't like tequila i love tequila  oh my god go down to cabo just do some tequila shots on the beach nice yes i like that we should 
[01:21:00]  go out and drink some tequila i like the way you think absolutely i like the way you think absolutely  you guys you guys have plans of uh coming to new york anytime the big apple yeah we need to go to  new york yeah come there you've never been come to new york we'll take uh pow out to uh some of the  bars for tequila you could hang out down in you know where west village somewhere around there yeah  i mean it's probably chelsea's a cool place chelsea's great city and we'll uh take uh we'll

[01:22:00]  eight degrees oh my so when you guys like really recently sat outside and had those drinks at that  outside restaurant it must have been freezing yeah it was all deep cold oh was it because you guys  were in like tank tops oh my god yeah you guys are a pisser man i love it yeah hey do you still like  johnny depp no that's that's the other room jimmy you really are confused i think you need to watch

[01:23:00]  actually a good question do they keep filming you after you got married for season two not yet  as always we'll see what happens we'll see yeah they're good well they're good they got it they got  talking to before yeah don't you dare say anything right you don't blow up our spot they will try to  trick you right believe me i i'm still single believe me i don't have anything on my finger

[01:26:00]  you know our show today all right there they go i'll tell you that that's gonna be great for  that business though man because oh yeah yeah she's fucking hot and everyone's gonna think they  could get like a pow but that's winning the lotto right yeah exactly yeah instead they're gonna get a  yuck yeah they're gonna get a fucking girl with a star wars phaser speaks norwegian it's a blaster  jim phaser's a star trek oh but is it no no i'd actually what was it called president of the door 
[01:26:30]  club exactly wow that was fun that was a fun little interview i don't think russ likes us  no of course not that's why because we were calling him gay and his wife can't imagine why  he wouldn't humiliating him on national radio in front of his brand new foreign wife why would he  why would he be angry oh that was fun i wonder if he's scolding him because she was trying to keep  up appearances yeah i was like what says tulsa world look cats out of the bag 
[01:27:00]  yeah yeah just panic it's a paper some newspaper thing well when you say something like oh you  can't believe everything you read yeah something you guys got it questioning i can't believe there's  only six episodes yeah and the fifth one airs on sunday i don't think they thought it is right the  fifth one is sunday yeah fucking six episodes that's it because they're gonna keep filming these  couples because they they show like 50 days to go so what they're gonna go through 50 days and in two 
[01:27:30]  episodes that's yeah well they went through four no but i mean that's a lot and they would be crazy  not to continue filming these uh couples because there's the dynamics are unbelievable what would  the show be though it's a new show yeah i don't know follow-up show well i mean the same way they've  done like uh you know like when they do teen mom and stuff like yeah they keep calling it teen mom  even though the mom's already given birth we like about her though their prison sentences and uh  diseases and uh coming out of closets perhaps right you know like i want to know will they do a follow 
[01:28:00]  show because they're gonna have new couples next season do you think russ knows that and that's what  he's not happy about the fact that they the way they edit it or what have you makes him look like  he's not very interested or or yeah certainly make him look like he's a bit dull yeah dull he's like  what made you think you know i wasn't into her in the hot tub it's like well that's what i saw  watch that show a little kiss is like well well it wasn't very good at this point i think we got to 
[01:28:30]  say that we have no fucking idea i have no idea i've never never had any idea it's just what we see  when we watch the show watch the show and they're editing and stuff like that certainly could be some  editing going on comes off a little mysterious right so quite why are you rolling your eyes but he seems  annoyed at that he seems annoyed at the way oh yeah he certainly does he's probably like of course  some cowboy all male yeah what the fuck they added like i knew that that scene was edited bad  when they're showing the friends like the music yeah yeah looking at her like she's crazy i'm like 
[01:29:00]  they probably had they probably had a great time that great time he might just be a gentleman  maybe he's not a maybe he's really religious maybe he's not a pig of a man yeah wow there are people  that don't fuck before marriage i don't get it but i mean pow didn't get it but you could do things  without fucking too jesus bury your face between those tits you gotta test drive that shit that's  just i like a good test drive kick cock in there also pow's wearing a wedding ring in one of the  photos that you posted on twitter well oh no is that it the wedding ring oh what happened oh what a waste 
[01:29:30]  yeah not only do i like it good test drive but what i do is i go into the dealership  and i fucking check out the rear trunk and then i fucking ignore the car  i come all over the fucking back window and ignore the car  or shoot alone on it and then i say you use the windshield wipers tell it to drive home  yeah exactly drive yourself to the car wash we got a guy from tulsa that wants in badly uh joe what's

[01:37:30]  make sure our numbers are good so spread the word look at those numbers see if they're any good  you want to see your number i want to see the whole thing actually i don't even look at one when i look  jimmy's moving up the charts climbing the charts he's up to uh jim jim norton hates animals i believe is  uh one of the top five on a podcast we've done we've done 40 about 39 and 40 yeah let's take a look at  the numbers here  oh  all right i see what's going on here 
[01:38:00]  nice yeah nicey nice i'm over here now  jimmy's got a nice number right there oh you know i was uh i was watching a rosemary's baby last  night really and um of course mia farrow's in that she's just adorable in that one i gotta say  with the short hair big doe eyes and uh you know that's the dakota building i know 
[01:38:30]  oh yes it's the dakota that's where lennon was shot uh-huh uh rosemary is that a good show  well same building lennon was shot in front of the building in rosemary's baby that's what i was  trying to say yes but uh god that movie's fucking good it's creepy uh it is creepy it's it's a good  a good movie though but the whole mia farrow thing and then that movie's directed by roman polanski  and like she's defending i guess polanski something's coming up no or something happened 
[01:39:00]  already character witness right a character witness for roman polanski and of course now you got this  whole woody allen and the daughter debacle and you would think she would be the one that would be  a little more sensitive about uh issues like that it's just such a weird situation because her  daughter's basically saying how can you support woody and how can you support what he did to me  but mia farrow is supporting roman polanski right a guy that kind of did very similar things right 
[01:39:30]  can't come back into the country was admitted to doing things right right yeah yeah so that is  interesting that just was very odd kind of thing um well what he's going to have uh something in  the new york times this weekend i believe oh yeah yeah he's going to rebut a little rebuttal he's  going to throw his own daughter under the bus oh he has to if it's not true his own daughter he's  going to throw under the bus and blame i'm sure he's going to just blame mia farrow for brainwashing  her or something i don't think he'll bash the daughter he'll probably say that she was very young  and she probably believes these things but it's a lie she was brainwashed kind of a thing 
[01:40:00]  yeah but i i was a buddy of mine is a lawyer and uh we stayed friends ever since that whole thing  happened the guy who was my lawyer we went out to lunch the other day we're talking about the woody  case i said to him why wouldn't woody just come out the legal culpability of just coming out and going  look and why is he letting his lawyer talk for him he explained some type of illegality where  because the lawyer because there's a public figure involved can deny it uh but if woody comes out and 
[01:40:30]  says anything uh everybody knows that he knows what the truth is so he might be liable for a lawsuit  there was some kind of a weird legal technicality which is why it's smarter to talk to the lawyer  it just comes off as insincere that was not by the way the legal explanation right that uh it was a  little different when you told it to you that was filtered through a dummy machine  i suck at that shit too oh man i was something a lawyer's lawsuit something about a lawyer yes  boy does it get lost in translation with me i hear it perfectly uh a year and then it comes out like 
[01:41:00]  i'm gonna hum and i run and then i'm listening to let's say hi to lady die we uh we gave her an  ultimatum all right about an hour ago time's about up uh so lady die is back on the phone  and uh we got the super show tomorrow uh it's sponsored by i hate stephen singer dot com  and uh and you uh out of nowhere decide you weren't coming in tomorrow uh with marion and so we 
[01:41:30]  basically said if you don't come in tomorrow you're pretty much dead to us so you said you would call  marion and reconsider and so now you're calling us back to uh discuss this further so i would assume  at this point you have talked to marion who said she has this stomach bug and we were suspicious of  that because she has the stomach bug but she's at work today so we're thinking that the stomach bug 
[01:42:00]  it can't be that bad so if she could go to work why wouldn't she come in here tomorrow  so we can wish her a happy birthday even though the show's not about her birthday but it would be  a side thing and maybe we would even get some kind of cake for marion and the big birthday but  certainly that's not why we're bringing everyone together for super show two thank you listen to me  i am going to the show tomorrow oh come on i will be there tomorrow okay cool nice now why thank you 
[01:42:30]  let me die why the changed of clogged heart and obviously in the end it was up to you you know  i will be there tomorrow if you want to call marion you can call her up  okay but i will be there tomorrow what happened to change your mind yeah did you call marion  yeah she said do whatever you want if you want to go out there in this mess i don't know what mess  is out there but what mess there's no mess fucking fine no she said if you want to go outside you mess 
[01:43:00]  i'm just trying to tell you that i will be there tomorrow okay yeah too bad colin won't be here but  you'll see him when he comes in march yeah yeah well whatever oh whatever what's the matter you sound  like this is a fucking problem yeah man what's up we want happy we want happy fun people right  happy fun people at this right you're none of those things yes  i love seeing you guys it doesn't bother me well okay i just go well tomorrow i'm just supposed to

[02:34:30]  weren't plowed i don't know they just i guess they sprinkled them with salt or something but  it's too cold for salt that you can work it just freezes over straight ice out there like and the  other thing is and these are all the idiots that you talk about all these idiots buy cars in the  summer and think that they can get by with a convertible sports car bmw with rear wheel drive  for their year-round car that's me and so they're skidding around the road that's me you get a sports car

[02:35:30]  like two inch thin tires so you can squeeze on the tallest rims 28 scott and you've got a a truck  that could plow through ice but it's completely useless because you put you got no tires on it  but girls love that shit i get ahead i told you i flicked that girl in the car because did you  really fuck her in the car she's been on the show before married gene that's how i first met her  penthouse yeah you met her on this show she came and did your show and she's done your show a bunch  of times now and she's gonna do it this weekend again i think after after your show i guess now if

[02:39:00]  she joking you would love this chick because she showed up 90 day fiance is a show where it's  mail-order brides but they're not really mail-order brides like they all meet these girls online  they come from different countries and then they come over with a 90-day visa and if they don't get  married they have to go back to their homeland so you got 90 days to get that ass exactly so this  brazilian chick comes over and she was she is engaged to be married to this mormon guy this moron  more men more men but he is also a moron he's showing her around his house 
[02:39:30]  and he shows her where the hot water heater is like this is where the hot water comes from and  she's going oh wow oh my god get out of here he starts showing her the cold and the hot water faucet  i mean hook it when i tell you these women are easy to impress  hot water hot water is like whoa you must be a king in the united states here she comes from this tiny  town in brazil but that's not the other chick that i would want you to see her name's pow get the 
[02:40:00]  fuck out of here and she comes from colombia pow like p-o-w p-a-o oh okay that's your catchphrase  my word too pow she comes from colombia yeah and she is the human incarnation of a sex doll  like super hot titties ass and she appears to completely curvy she loves to shake her ass  they took her to a but she lives in oklahoma what and they took her to country line dancing and she 
[02:40:30]  was like i don't really like this like i just like to kind of feel the music and she just started  wiggling her hips you'd love it the minute she showed up her first day she was like i have to  take a shower and he goes okay and she goes no we should take a shower together and the guy's just  sitting there going oh i don't know i don't know about all this exactly uh but we had them on the  phone today get the hell out of pow and her and her and the moron fiance russ but while we were on the  phone pow was like saying uh we've uh we're still you know we're still going through the 90 days i 
[02:41:00]  don't know what's going to happen but everybody in this room opie and anthony especially and jim of  course have understand how show business works and just they understand that when you see a tv  on the tv it's that little people it's not happening right now okay yeah it was filmed  and edited the 90 days are over and we found like they were just they kept trying to keep up this  facade oh hell no but we found serious the announcement in the in the newspaper in oklahoma 
[02:41:30]  that they had gotten married one of the fans tweeted me he sent me their wedding certificate  oh you guys are calling me you're calling me a liar yeah no these two were liars but also  also the guy has a little mystery about him he never really seems into uh into pow like she's  always trying to hit on him why is he like avoiding that moisture well he comes from a very religious  family let's say like 10 bitches at the same time certain no he's not the mormon he's another guy 
[02:42:00]  okay but uh let's just say certain things might not be accepted certain lifestyle choices the guy  is probably a big fan of hip-hop these days get out of here you know what i'm saying oh he likes the  finger well that's uh that's all accusations and possibilities i don't know what's true with this  show but that's the way the show makes it makes it seem so that i mean you got to watch it and if  you didn't hear the pow interview today you got to listen to the whole thing it was like 45 minutes  of just uncomfortable awkwardness at one point they hung up on the chick's husband because they 
[02:42:30]  were both on separate lines they go all right i'll talk to you guys later and just hung up on the  husband they go okay pow now it's just you the first two ten minutes of the interview they were  just talking to pow they didn't even pick up the husband just hitting on her she's slutty is she kind  of slutty she seems very she's a nice slutty no she seems very sexual so slutty she came down she's  living with the guy's parents she came downstairs in lingerie what and the parents were like yeah  you should put a robe on i was like no it's the greatest show you've ever seen i gotta check it out 
[02:43:00]  let me find out what uh do we have line of the day yeah i would actually work with this oh good okay  let's find out what today's uh opie and anthony show line of the day was  here  you know there are a lot more there's some pretty nasty things in columbia you can eat  sure like you heard her talking about like vaginas right ross 
[02:43:30]  oh we got it congratulations dude it was all of us in here just like went oh my god what did he  just say is that uncomfortable you couldn't be more literal like that's russ on the phone with him  oh that kind of we were kind of hinting at the fact that he might look to prefer the company of men  on the tv show and then opie just has to shout out like vaginas am i right russ he's like  oh there's nothing wrong with that if he doesn't want no vagina no there's nothing wrong with that 
[02:44:00]  but there is something wrong with like putting up a farce and denying it lying and lying who kid  something i'm allegedly doing i don't believe i don't think that's true yeah was what's his name  from the seahawks did he have his thumb in his mouth yeah he's got it was a big thumb too i was  looking at the hand i was like yeah that sounds like an oral fixation to me i don't know how he put  that in his mouth does he look like he'd done it before like the left cheek was swollen that's how big  the thumb was wow so he had a dick in his mouth like okay i thought we're gonna work with subtleties 
[02:44:30]  on that we just went right for the uh cock in his mouth yeah okay good good is that better i  understand now do you understand i get it now sal do you have an ona clip of the day i do but we're  running a little bit low on time oh do you have a long enough time to talk about it no but it was uh  i could play it if you want 30 seconds and then we'd have to go straight to the reed no no don't play  what was it just tell me it was jim uh jim's line about uh how uh russ would prefer uh balls on his 
[02:45:00]  chin on his nose yeah then he better like get cow testicles at dinner once and so that was just  jokes on jokes on jokes they eat a lot of weird stuff out there man in columbia where would they  eat cow nuts that was in oklahoma no yeah they fry them up yeah they call them like rocky mountain  oysters sometimes they have all sorts of terms so there's balls on your plate like and you're  spicing deep fried testicles you can see the balls you probably i'll bet that like over like on the  chitlin circuit or whatever they eat some deep fried testicles holy shit i bet they have chicken

[03:02:00]  a phrase that i have stolen and used over and over and over again i give you credit but it's  woo peddler oh yeah yeah deepak chopra yeah yeah yeah yeah i definitely didn't coin that but i i love  it too i guess a lot every time i see that dude i just think woo peddler yeah didn't we have a little  kind of twitter thing with him yeah yeah i was i was calling him i asked if he woo peddled much yeah 
[03:02:30]  and then and then it was something about he was saying like i am a god and you were like we peddle  much and he was like oh it was really funny i favorited it but yeah he was actually like he was he  had a good sense of humor about it i don't think he takes himself totally seriously yeah he's not  like cult leader seriously i think he gets a he gets ahead of himself and he says some really  ridiculous shit and then when people call him on it you know he just starts using the word quantum  yeah i think that's true throws that shit in there but quantum consciousness is 
[03:03:00]  i think you know i think better him than a lot of other people in his position better him than you  know that kevin trudeau guy that's selling you weight lock secrets that they don't want you to  know about that's true it doesn't seem like deep i mean deepak's trying to sell his books but outside  of that i don't really feel like he is that much of you know like a predator like he's not using  this kind of pseudoscience and and truth be told there is a little bit of truth to some of the  things that he talks about but but he does kind of i think step way outside of the boundaries of 
[03:03:30]  what's reasonable and healthy but you're right i don't think he's actually trying to take advantage  of people fundamentally i think that deepak chopra thinks what he's talking about i mean he believes in  what he's talking about and i think that he actually thinks that he's helping people and maybe he is helping  some people but he's also peddling a lot of woo i think i think he probably is helping a lot of  people i think he's definitely peddling a lot of woo and one thing that i always get out of him is  that i don't think even he knows what he's saying i think there's a lot of times where people will try 
[03:04:00]  to uh impress upon you that what they're saying is important and one of the ways they do that is by  using these like really kind of like vague terms that sound fantastic yeah i mean that's really i  think where that term pseudoscience comes from it's not real science it's it's it's fake science it's  bad science but it sort of sounds like science to an untrained ear and that's the dangerous thing is  if you throw around a lot of really big words and you are really authoritative a lot of people kind  of believe what you're telling them well also there's an issue in that some of it does have some truth 
[03:04:30]  to it and when you fuck around and pretend that it all does or you mush it all together you you you  create this really cloudy atmosphere i'm not sure what the fuck you're saying and i'm not sure if it's  true but and it's really hard for like an everyday person who goes okay well i've heard that before  and you know my doctor told me that and you know that seems important and then they throw in all these  other things well i mean if you're an authority figure and you're saying all these things that are  true i guess i should believe you when you say all these other things it's a really dangerous um you 
[03:05:00]  know that's that's the that's it right up there oh he says i was an atheist hashtag until i discovered  i was god and then i said son don't make me smack you woo pedal much and then he responded he responded  something really funny i don't know if you can find it yeah like yes we're all god in drag yeah we're all  god in drag that actually is very funny i was like oh that's pretty awesome well you know he did a uh  a thing with his son where his son followed him around with a camera and completely exposed him 
[03:05:30]  and he went on tour like promoted this with his son and did like interviews on like opie and anthony and  all these different places but one of them was like his son like caught him sleeping when he was  supposed to be meditating i'm going to the temple to meditate and he then go into the temple he's  he's completely out cold lying on his back and it's it's it's quite funny because his son sort of  you know grew up with him and sons and fathers have notoriously contentious relationships i'm always 
[03:06:00]  incredibly impressed when i meet a daughter who gets along great with her mom or a son who gets along  great with his dad because somewhere along the line in those male male female female relationships  there seems to be this like changing of the guard or something like that or this need to be your own  person and deepak's son has that in buckets he's got buckets full of that but it's cool that deepak  doesn't really take himself too seriously it's cool that he you know his son catches him asleep and he's 
[03:06:30]  like yeah put it put it on the internet put it in the movie it's quantum i was not caught i was traveling  it was a way i was my third eye was open to the possibilities yeah he did a uh an interview or a  debate rather with uh richard dawkins fairly recently on i think it was uh he was challenging  dawkins on the concept of atheism and you know and dawkins was just being his cadre old cunty self 
[03:07:00]  but it actually made it actually made him dawkins look bad yeah and i mean that's the thing it's it's  when you engage in those kinds of conversations with people who can really hold their own you've got  to be really careful because dawkins i think his take and i respect the man immensely his take is  very much an educated you know i'm an evolutionist i'm an evolutionary biologist these are the reasons  that i don't believe in god but he's very hard-lined about it and there is something about being this  kind of ivory tower british elite that just kind of makes you seem like a dick even like he's not a 
[03:07:30]  dick he's a really sweet man i've met him before he's he's soft-spoken and but the truth is you you  put those two men in a room together i mean deepak knows what he's doing he knows that like part of a  debate or part of a conversation is about bringing out certain aspects of somebody's character it's  about likability and i think it's easy for people who aren't already kind of hard-lined atheists and  who aren't already big docking supporters to be like that guy seems mean well i think he is mean i 
[03:08:00]  disagree with you really i think i think he is a dick and i think he is mean and i think um that's  because he's had to deal with idiots over and over and over again and he's an extremely intelligent  man and he's tired of it could be that and he gets this quivering in his lips when he talks to people  you know no that is not what's going on and he gets so furious about defending science and defending  the truth i i don't think he's a dick in in a in unjust way i think he's a dick for a reason he's a 
[03:08:30]  dick because he's a normal guy and i think he's also a dick because he's a normal guy with a lot of  knowledge that doesn't have a lot of release in his life probably and he's also i think he's also  sheltered a little bit because of his position because of you know when you work in academia  and you're kind of surrounded by like-minded people a lot and only periodically do you go  out into the real world where there's a lot of people who don't have the education that you have  and who have totally different values and belief systems i'm sure it can be really really frustrating  because you're constantly having to defend a position that's the rational position that like 
[03:09:00]  anybody else who's come up through the ranks that you came up uh you know 97 of practicing  scientists or something like that don't believe in god and maybe it's not that high but 97 definitely  you know know that global warming is true and and maybe something like 75 in america don't believe  in god um but we're like a very religious country but when you kind of go through the motions and you  just come to these logical conclusions because of all of the different life choices you've made but  then you interact with people who are from such a different background who have never studied evolution 
[03:09:30]  who have never studied you know global climate change or whatever it's like talking to a wall  sometimes because you almost can't have the same kind of reasonable conversations because when you're  talking to somebody who's not coming from a rational evidence-based place who's coming from kind of  appeals to emotion or who's coming from folklore or whatever reason they have to defend their kind of  belief structure their faith position it's really frustrating because you don't really have a lot of  ammunition at a certain point but especially when you're talking to somebody like jipak chopra who 
[03:10:00]  has like made a career kind of being good at debating who knows exactly the way to twist your  words and to make it sound like what he's speaking is the truth and then he's got this like very benevolent  kind of kind and calm demeanor and he's gonna make dawkins look like a dick oh see i didn't think that  he did any any twisting of any words at all oh really i know no i think you know he seemed like  a woo peddler i mean to use your term he that's what he seemed like but dawkins was just getting so 
[03:10:30]  angry yeah and it's that old saying you know never argue with an idiot because people won't be able to  tell who's who you know or i don't know that's not the saying i don't know it works for me i would  never like i would never debate a creationist like people thought oh you should blah blah blah and i think  like bill nye i don't know if it's happened yet but bill nye's supposed to debate ken ham that's insane  i don't know why he's doing it i mean i i have friends you know i'm friends with sean carroll who's  a physicist at um caltech and and writes these really great books about about time and about um  quantum physics and he does periodically debate creationists and i'm always like what are you doing 
[03:11:00]  that sounds like such a bad idea you know like because these people are skilled just in the art of  conversation they're skilled in the art of debate even if what they're saying has no weight they know how to  argue these positions and try and trap you and get you on the defensive they have all of these  different kind of uh uh skill sets but he always says it's not for me it's not to try and prove  him wrong it's not to try and convince him not to believe in god you know like this guy is ken ham is 
[03:11:30]  like a hardcore fundamentalist christian we're never going to change his mind so they say the reason that  we do these debates is for the people who are sitting there watching who may be like well i don't know  the difference between evolution and intelligent design i've never thought about it i've never  really looked at the evidence that maybe even a small percentage of the people who decide to tune  in will be given some sort of information that they didn't have before that they can be armed with to 
[03:12:00]  make better decisions but i don't know to me it just seems like i mean i think it's a noble pursuit  but at the same time i'm not sure how effective it really is to debate a creationist i think i disagree  with you i think it's i don't think you're going to convince the creationist no not at all but i do  think that there's there's value in someone who's good at it if someone has the ability to speak and  speak well and also they have to have a certain amount of charisma they do they absolutely do the  issue the dawkins issue is that he gets so emotionally invested in this fucking horse 
[03:12:30]  shit that deepak spewing that he gets angry and furious instead of mocking him like there's a brilliant  exchange with a there was a scientist there was a uh a panel and deepak was on the panel and this  this uh scientist stepped up and uh asked deepak a question and uh deepak clearly didn't know what  the fuck he was talking about but the way the guy handled it was very sweet and he was smiling while he 
[03:13:00]  did it and explained that he was in the process of writing a book with stephen hawkins and that he was  in the middle of this and that i i don't he's like i understand those words you said but uh i'm not  sure if they mean anything like this is the way he said it it was it was adorable like because the  the guy didn't lose his cool and it made deepak look like a fucking idiot whereas if the same guy  got up and said you know what is this quantum talk you're talking a bunch of fucking bullshit and  shut up and you don't know then all of a sudden you know deepak is this pudgy indian man that you're 
[03:13:30]  picking on screams of racism and all these other fucking hot buttons get pushed yeah i think the  same thing can be done skillfully with these creationist fellows like sure i think the idea  behind creationism is is so preposterous that in in the form that we see it in the form of you know  not not in the form of something created the universe whether it's some sort of a universal force  that creates stars or the reason why atoms exist in the first place all these like fundamental 
[03:14:00]  questions that scientists have as to why the structure of the universe is what it is there's  that but then there's this book that has been translated from other books and then they're  sticking to this fucking crazy book just point out the other shit in the book that's ridiculous  like the shit in the book about not being able to wear two different different types of cloth yeah and  they do that usually they'll point out the shit in the book that's ridiculous and they  figure out you know and point out how if the book says this you truly believe this in this century  and science has unequivocally disproven what it is that you believe you know it's one thing to talk 
[03:14:30]  about like you said uh you know these big questions like what came before the big bang or you know what  a lot of i feel like um intelligent design advocates confused for example evolution via natural selection  with uh a biogenesis so they confuse the idea of how uh organisms have evolved over time with how  life began in the first place which is a fundamentally different scientific question different topic totally  different field of inquiry and so you know a lot of times what they do is they appeal to these two 
[03:15:00]  questions they say like well you don't know what existed before the big bang therefore god done mic drop  you know every time and and instead of kind of allowing that it's to say you know okay neither  of us know why is god the the first you know answer that you jump to let's look at all the other times  when you're saying that the answer is god and we've disproven it over and over and over and over and  just because we don't have all of the answers to every question right now using the scientific method 
[03:15:30]  doesn't mean that you know through through new tools through new uh lines of inquiry that we might  be able to answer those in the future it doesn't mean that like just because we don't have that doesn't  mean that there aren't other philosophical answers to these questions that don't rely on this like  very fundamentalist view i think personally that for example bill nye is going to be able to hold his  own he's a total badass he's not going to lose his cool and ken ham if you've ever watched him in i mean  he's a nut job like he's a total puff some videos he's a total nutter butter and he will lose his 
[03:16:00]  cool and he's totally not likable like nothing about this guy is likable so i i think that maybe  that's why bill nye was willing to do it because i've seen bill nye right go on like bill o'reilly a  million times and there's kind of a mutual respect there he he deals with bill o'reilly very well and  i'm always impressed you see the one where bill o'reilly is like the tide comes in the tide comes out  why does it do that yeah you can't explain that yeah he's with steve i'm going with god yeah yeah  it was so funny i'm putting my ships in god's corner such a face well it's it's a he's a 
[03:16:30]  bullshitter i i think i think he's a panderer i think what he's doing is he knows that there's a  bunch of scared old ladies with bibles in their hand that listen to his show and he's on their side  totally i mean he's and he's honestly not even as bad as rush limbaugh and who's the other guy the  mormon guy glenn back glenn back the the late in life mormon guy which is even better than being  a mormon so tough you know i was mormon did we have this conversation i didn't last time i was on 
[03:17:00]  i'm not sure i was raised mormon really yeah my folks are still well my dad's still mormon his  whole-sided family yeah or are you from utah no i'm from texas wow mormon texas yeah there's there's  a lot i mean they're everywhere they're everywhere but uh yeah born and raised um left the church when i was  14 wow when you were 14 what was it that got you to i just didn't like i was it's it's so funny too  because i hadn't found science yet it's not like i knew you know i didn't have like all these answers 
[03:17:30]  available to me i just probably around like 12 maybe 11 like when you start questioning things i really  started questioning things and a lot of things weren't making sense for me and uh you know just  a lot of the answers that they give you in the church like weren't sitting well with me and so i was  studying and i was trying to figure out like you know i've been taught this my whole life but it  just doesn't make sense it doesn't sit well with reality and i remember going to my father and  saying you know i have all these questions i'm very confused i'm not sure i believe and the answer they  always give you is just to like really pray about you know it's like they give you all of these answers 
[03:18:00]  that aren't helping at all they don't they don't really improve your confusion at all and so  ultimately i finally just came to him and said like i i i'm pretty sure at this point that i really don't  believe in god and and attending which is a huge part of your life when you're 14 i mean when you're  in high school and you're mormon you go to church for three hours every sunday you go to youth group  every wednesday night you have all sorts of family things like family home evening every monday night  and then you go to seminary which is either bible book of mormon uh and then like pearl of great price 
[03:18:30]  and doctrine and covenant study um every morning before school i would go at 6 a.m for like an hour before  school and it's i mean it's really intense it takes up a huge part of your life and when you  don't believe it's kind of i mean you have to come out you have to come out like it's it's so painful  like you're stuck in this skin that's not you and i mean obviously i don't know what it's like for  somebody who is gay who's like you know scared to come out in their community but um i would assume 
[03:19:00]  that there's like at least a faint similarity to that feeling of like i can't live like this because  i'm lying to myself every day so i finally came out to my father and it was like not good it was a  difficult situation it was hard for the family and i didn't end up like i ended up actually not  having a relationship with him for many years it's it's better now but at the time it was like a  really intense thing like as a 14 year old kid to be like oh i need to make this like really intense  life decision so your dad didn't want to interact with you because or you didn't want to interact 
[03:19:30]  with him because of the pressure it was like so so my parents were divorced so i went to my dad's  house every other weekend and then like i think like a month in the summer or something like that  but we also went to his house on sundays to go to church together because my mom wasn't attending  after they got divorced and so he basically told me um i remember the quote to this day i have a moral  obligation to god to force you to go to church until you're 18 years old as long as you're living under  my roof and i was like i'm not gonna go anymore and he was like well then i guess you're not gonna live  under my roof anymore oh yeah so it was a really tough decision it was kind of like me or me or your 
[03:20:00]  atheism and at the time i i just felt like i can't not make this decision so we didn't speak for a long  time and i like didn't go to his house for a really long time we didn't have a relationship but it  improved over time it improved you're a very smart person i always assumed that that's genetic i always  assume that there's at least some element of that that's genetic i mean there it's it's intelligence is um  thank you by the way but intelligence is a really really complicated topic in neuroscience and 
[03:20:30]  psychology and so there's really not a lot of evidence available that says that intellectual  ability is hereditary let me tell you something i have a friend he's dumb his wife's dumb their kid's  stupid as fuck okay there's something there there probably is something there and especially in terms  of especially in terms of environment so a lot of times what can happen is that let's say that you have  to you they do these twin studies all the time it's one of the only real ways with human behavior  to um to understand pure genetics right because like my sister and i have very different lives and 
[03:21:00]  we have very different personalities and we have very different intellectual abilities but my sister  and i are genetically different even though we came from the same source dna right half mom half dad  it's all shuffled together you didn't get the same alleles on your genes and we are literally night and  day but if you took two people who were monozygotic twins who are identical twins and those two kids  got adopted out when they were babies and they were raised by two totally different people and this 
[03:21:30]  happens in nature a lot or not nature but you know it happens in society a lot and you study those two  kids you'll find that the kid who grew up in an impoverished environment with um you know who wasn't  getting appropriate or adequate nutrition whose parents were not highly intelligent or educated  versus the kid who grew up in this very rich environment like this the kid who grew up in  the impoverished environment will not be as intelligent like a huge part of its environmental  a huge part same thing with my i mean you see it in animals too you put a mouse in a cage with nothing 
[03:22:00]  there and you put a mouse in a cage with all sorts of amazing things for it to interact with  its brain is going to to actually grow larger you're going to see more kind of neural interactions much more  intense um branching of different neurons so now that's not to say that there's not a genetic  component it's just very hard to pinpoint what the genetic component is it's been kind of an enigma to  be able to chase that it totally makes sense i mean there's so many different variables so many and  like let's say you have a friend who's dumb and his wife is dumb their kid might be dumb because they 
[03:22:30]  don't know you know it's like they're not speaking intelligently to the child they don't they don't have a  really great grasp of the english language they're probably not reading very challenging books but  sometimes you do see parents who maybe are limited but they so desperately want everything that their  kid deserves and the kid you know shines intellectually from the time their kid and  they really foster that even though they might not even be able to have an intelligent conversation with  their kid they're going to put their kid in a great school and they're going to oh he's so he's so 
[03:23:00]  gifted i want to make sure he's always taken care of and that kid might grow up to be you know just a  little genius and you see it a lot you know you see it where a child grows up to be this really  um you know academic star and his parents maybe weren't exactly on the same page yeah it is such  a crap shoot when you deal with life experiences and then you deal with education i mean what just  the teachers that you get the school that you go to the books that someone just by chance made hey  you might be interested in this and then boom a light bulb goes off a new door opens up to your mind 
[03:23:30]  and then you start pursuing that path and then there's like even silly things like you know do  you are you eating well are you exercising are you doing drugs like like those kinds of yeah exactly  but it those kinds of things they're actually the most fundamental you know because if you are there's  actually really high correlation between intelligence and um or a high inverse relationship between  intelligence and poverty because it's just when you're growing up and you don't eat enough and then 
[03:24:00]  you're going to school you can't focus you can't pay attention you don't sleep enough you're working  an extra job it's just so hard to get ahead of the game that way and so there's so many different  variables and that's why i think fundamentally whenever you have these conversations like is it  nature is it nurture well it's always both it's all almost everything is nature and nurture there's  some things that are very heavily genetic like especially when it comes to deficits like if you're  you know if these two genes didn't split the right way or if this cell migrated in this direction and it 
[03:24:30]  didn't work that way and then you end up let's say with some sort of intense genetic uh uh difficulty  you end up with uh down syndrome for example there's only so much you can do you can do a lot  environmentally to improve the life to improve your life and improve your abilities but you still have  down syndrome right and so you still might be dealing with something of a ceiling even though i think  you can push that ceiling up and vice versa you know you can do a lot um kind of environmentally to  improve or whatever um but there are still always going to be some sort of there there's always going 
[03:25:00]  to be some sort of like genetic component but it is very difficult sometimes the lines get really  blurred and it's so hard to tell from the outside that's why we do experiments with animals i mean  it's a really heavy reason that geneticists so commonly use animals in the lab because you can clone  a bunch of animals you can have a very specific line of animals and then you can do something where  you change some sort of environmental component or some sort of drug or you do something with  the brain of these 10 different mice well all the mice were clones so they started out genetically 
[03:25:30]  exactly the same so you can't do this in humans you can't like make sure every other variable is  kept the same and then only manipulate one variable because we just grow up with these rich intense  interesting lives but you can do that with animals which is why animal research is so important to  answer a lot of fundamental questions it's really kind of if you stop and think about it there's  like 300 million experiments going on in this country i mean that's what humans are we're all  experiments we're all like this is what happens when someone plays soccer from the time they were 
[03:26:00]  five exactly what happens they only eat cake this is what happens if your dad beats you this is what  happens if your parents ignore you and can you imagine if like your dad or your mom was a really intense  kind of uh cognitive psychologist or experimental psychologist like you know there's all these i  don't think that they're necessarily true or i'm not sure how much truth there is to it but there's all  these like tales about like bf skinner who's probably one of the most famous behaviorists and in history  every psychology student learns about skinner um you know like skinner has a kid and then like all of 
[03:26:30]  the things that he might do to the to the crib that his daughter grows up in and exactly how oh i'm  gonna do an enrichment experiment with my child like i cannot imagine yeah that would be really  intense yeah that's uh there's a lot of stake when you do something like that your kid might resent  you for that yeah well you know we all resent our parents for some reason or another don't we i guess  some do there's um there's a story about a woman who uh owned a comedy club and had a son who was a 
[03:27:00]  comedian and when he would cry when he was younger she would ignore him because she felt like if she  ignored him he grew up funny oh no yeah and that probably is true no not funny didn't work he wasn't  didn't work at all he grew up to be a cunt yeah i grew up super depressed just a shitty human but there  is kind of it's interesting you know there's a recent study actually and i'm i don't know how much  stock i put into this because whenever there's like a single study that gets a lot of media attention  that's how we do it in in this country specifically when it comes to the media and science we're really bad 
[03:27:30]  about picking up oh that study is really interesting so let's um let's pick it up and all the different  media outlets are going to talk about this one study where we got one you know uh dose of results  and we're going to say it like it's truth right but there was this recent study that uh where all  these different comedians i guess i think it was in the uk actually were yeah like answered a self  report questionnaire and they found that there's a really high uh percentage of um it wasn't psychopathy 
[03:28:00]  it was uh it was psychotic uh personality traits in comedians and so it's actually kind of interesting  and almost every comedian i talk to is always like most comedians are kind of fucked up like it's like  you know their their anecdotal kind of stories are a lot of comedians deal with this or they deal with  that and you know that humor is kind of a tool that a lot of comedians develop over their lifetime  i think especially comedians who specifically have like a shtick like you know i deal with weight issues  so all my jokes are about my weight i deal with my bad relationship with my parents so all my jokes 
[03:28:30]  are about that and um yeah i mean i don't know i don't think you can make any sort of blanket  statements there's probably like incredibly high functioning people who have never dealt with mental  illness at all but i think there is some sort of like really beautiful truth in comedy where you know  there are a lot of people who are very highly skilled at taking these fundamentally human challenges  that we all deal with uh whether it's mental illness whether it's feelings of uh regret or  feelings of loneliness or feeling like you don't fit in and using humor as a tool to really deliver 
[03:29:00]  these kinds of very universal messages and there's a skill in that and i wonder if it's that maybe we  all deal a little bit with psychotic personality traits we all deal a little bit with depression with  anxiety you know pick your poison and that a lot of comedians are much more in touch with that they  figured out a way to have this vehicle for talking about these very human experiences and they do it  in such a way that we can all kind of share in it and laugh together about it i mean i don't know but 
[03:29:30]  well i i read that study and i thought one of the things that's i found issue with is they found 500  funny people in england yeah i seriously i don't see that maybe for england i've actually never been  to england have you been to england it's great i want to go i'm fucking around i love it over there  i've been i've been all over europe but i've never it's like so strange i've never been to like the  the easiest country to travel to because we speak the same language yeah they're great they're they're  fantastic comedy club audiences they love american stand-up too their their type of stand-up is very 
[03:30:00]  different i'm sure but they're huge fans of american stand-up they they tend to be witty and a bit more  reserved and um you know very good great wordsmiths yeah great writers um but they studied 500 comedians  this is the thing there's not that many comedians if you took america which is 300 million people  and you said okay how many comedians are there there's maybe a thousand professional comedians 
[03:30:30]  out of 300 million out of those thousand how many of them are actually good there's maybe 250 there  might be 250 comedians in this country that are worth a fuck yeah it does make you a question like  how like are they self-described community like how do they find these people and how do you get 500 in  england you only have 250 in america i mean i just don't i don't buy it and maybe they weren't professional  comedians maybe they're just people who found themselves to be funny well it's also i don't  know if their circuit is as deep and wide as ours is i mean you go to uh like new york city has 20 
[03:31:00]  comedy clubs you know i mean los angeles has god knows how many i mean we could just sit here and  just count especially when you count the greater la area you branch out to places like brea and irvine  and ontario and la might have 50 fucking comedy clubs and it's not just la new york i mean every major  city has at least one or two comedy clubs and you know comics go on tour all over the country and  and really big comics don't even play in comedy clubs at a certain point you know they're they're  packing theaters and we still do though we still work our shit out at comedy clubs you have to 
[03:31:30]  well at least for me i i find that there's a certain amount of um the intimacy that you get in  a comedy club is you can't get that anywhere else yeah in big theaters the big theater shows like  i did the chicago theater this weekend which is like three thousand plus seats but like then i'll  do the ice house like the little room which is 80 seats but that 80 seat room is like you're i'm  sitting like as close as i am to you and you if they're laughing it's because it's funny yeah it's  a real intimate sort of a thing you comedy you know to do it correctly in my opinion and to be really 
[03:32:00]  in touch with what you're doing you need a you need a lot of different environments to do it in  i think that's smart i mean to have kind of a lot of different experiences so then you can really  tell what sticks and what works with different audiences and it's not just that it's also you  how you feel about saying it to these people how they react to it and how that resonates with you  because what a person says is is not just like this is what i have inside of me and uh this is how you 
[03:32:30]  react to it comedy is one of the rare art forms where you can't even practice it without other  people's input yeah and so it's not just what you're saying it's how like this conversation  that we're having would be very different if you were your dad if you were the guy who's the mormon  who's still sticking to you so like the way i say things would be different the way we would interact  would be different and much like you know we're talking about all the variables that go into creating 
[03:33:00]  a human there's also massive variables going into just creating conversations totally a conversation  one of the things that i'm finding about podcasts is that a conversation really is kind of a piece of  art if if you can listen to it and it's really interesting and it becomes like something that's  enriching to you and inspiring to you and and the person and the people that are engaging in this  conversation are careful with the things that they say in terms of like they're intently focusing on 
[03:33:30]  what they're saying and not just just spitting out word salad there's an art to that and that that art  gets to you and it sort of enriches you i think that that conversation and and stand-up comedy they're  very similar in that way that stand-up comedy is like it's it's dependent almost entirely on the  environments that you do it in and the people that are that are experiencing it and it seems like  there's kind of always a goal um whether it's spoken or not of this sort of sense of universality the  sense of like just because you and i are having a conversation right now doesn't mean that everybody 
[03:34:00]  at home who's listening isn't a part of the conversation you know what i mean i think it's  so important that the the topics that we engage in the the things that we you know the emotions that we  share have uh they resonate with other people and that's so important in comedy too like there is i  think there's something to be said about just like a wacky person who says all sorts of wacky things that  are totally out of step with everybody oh that's so weird and different and that's funny but i think that  would lose its stick after a while i think part of what's really important in comedy is that there's 
[03:34:30]  these like universal kind of themes that are touched on that people really relate to because when you're  like uh you're totally talking about me right now it's because we're like fundamentally selfish and i  think it's important that when we watch tv when when we sit down and you know pay money to to be  entertained that it feels like you're talking to me you know not the person next to me but me that i'm  engaged in this conversation it's it's a part of our nature and so i think that there there is like 
[03:35:00]  you said a big art to that to reaching people especially people who maybe sometimes don't feel  like they're reached you know i can't watch two and a half men and feel like it relates to me at all  like it's like the worst show on television it's so not funny it so does not speak to me and i don't  get it because it it it's like the most popular show you know everybody loves it or like duck dynasty  for example it's like one of the highest rated shows of all time which is fucking insane to me  but um but there is something i mean there's a reason that these things do really well is because 
[03:35:30]  there's a whole cross-section of people that they find it to be like really relatable for them you  know what i mean and i think that there's an art in that there's an art in creating television  there's an art in doing radio there's an art in doing comedy any of these kind of spoken word kind  of avenues i think shows like two and a half men uh especially duck dynasty is sort of a trick  because what duck dynasty is pretending is that you're looking into the lives of these wholesome  god-fearing you know duck call creators massively now but what we find out now is that they're just 
[03:36:00]  idiots and that also they've been doctored up they've talked these people into growing those  fucking beards and wearing camo indoors and all the stupid shit that they do is contrived and also  yeah i do think that there's there's a difference between feeling like you know i'm a part of this and  they're speaking to me and then there's this gross kind of base human desire to like be a voyeur to  like look in on somebody else's life who has it worse off than you do so that you can like go okay  no matter how hard i have it no matter what kind of shit i'm dealing with these people are 
[03:36:30]  fucking freak shows and they make me feel better about myself which is such a gross like that's one  thing you know i i work in television but i've also done you know work in journalism and you know i'm  i'm still you know i'm 30 years old i'm i'm on my course my career course i've been successful but  at the same time you're always kind of reinventing yourself and trying to figure out your track in  life and one thing that i've you know i i go to i take a lot of meetings in in hollywood i go to a  lot of you know this person pitches this science show and i really want to do this thing and it 
[03:37:00]  sounds like okay cool that sounds interesting let's talk about it we could take it to this network  and one of the things that i fundamentally always say no to i do draw a line in the sand i don't have the  luxury of oh i don't have time to take that meeting you know like that's not i'm not there  by any stretch and i don't think that that's even a goal but um that's my goal yeah just to be able to  say fuck off i'm better than yeah but but the one thing is if i do go to a meeting my fundamentals that  i don't do what i have dubbed kind of humiliation television it's not something i ever want to have 
[03:37:30]  anything to do with you know in the in the industry they might call it conflict reality there's all  these different euphemisms for because what i do fundamentally is reality tv because it's non-fiction  programming right i'm mostly into the edutainment sphere i'm really interested in you know science  based programming or political based programs so it's all non-fiction so it's reality it's not  scripted that and duck dynasty are the in the center are in the same i know genre so for me specifically 
[03:38:00]  i call that kind of tv humiliation tv a lot of producers call it conflict reality which is  not not a place i ever want to be which sucks because that's where tv is moving like that's  where the jobs are but i won't do it you know what i mean i don't see i don't see i don't come on like  all the most popular highest rated shows are like that it's just a trend i really believe but it's  trending down you know what i mean don't you feel like we are well on our way to idiocracy like you  watch that movie and they're literally watching a show called ouch my balls like the whole movie 
[03:38:30]  they're watching ouch my balls or yeah ow my balls or something where they just follow each other  around and like punch each other in the balls and then the people oh it's hilarious is punching  them in the balls and it's like wasn't that jacket like isn't that what we're watching now like that's  so fucking you know speaking of the uk and tv have you seen this show black mirror i've heard of it i  have not seen it but i've heard it's so fucking good and i'm super depressed because i watched it i like  binge watch it all in a weekend and then realized that it was an anthology but they only made three in like  2011 and like three in 2013 so it's done like there's only six episodes ever which is super 
[03:39:00]  depressing so those of you at home who want to watch this like morning there's only six episodes  so make them last it's it's like a it's like a modern day twilight zone it's really well done it's  super dark but one of the really interesting components about it is that it has this sort of  dystopian uh technology angle right it's like future but not too far in the future so as you're  watching it is very relatable like they use technology really smartly but just like we are 
[03:39:30]  you know just like i was talking about this idea of um ouch my balls being the way the television is  going you watch this this show and they're all on their phones they have these you know these  implants in their heads or in their ears each episode is different but it's like so believable and so sad  that this could potentially be the direction that our culture is going because i i mean now  i'm driving you know i was just driving here which is a kind of a hike from hollywood so i'm on the 
[03:40:00]  freeway like for quite a long time and i'm looking there's a little bit of traffic so when we're stopped  i'm looking into cars or i'm especially like city buses you look in the city buses and literally every  single person headphones in on their phone like no interaction between other people so dialed into their  phones and what this show does really well is take that component and like what happens when we push  it what happens when we go into the future where nobody even cares about one another anymore they  just live in this like weird digital world and their avatar is who they are and they they spend all their 
[03:40:30]  money like buying their avatar a new hat or something like they don't like the concept of wearing a hat  in life wouldn't make sense because who gives a shit what you're wearing because your avatar is  wearing this hat and all the avatars interacted but you don't interact with it it's like  fascinating because there's a fear that that's kind of the direction we're going um as far as like  that was a long interesting rant as far as uh television like uh television dumbing down and 
[03:41:00]  becoming a part of idiocracy i think one of the issues is the delivery method of television in the  first place is massively flawed because first of all you're dealing with censorship censorship huge  fucks everything up you're dealing with a gang of people that you're you're getting involved with  that don't want to offend anybody they want to make sure that you promote whatever values that  represent their sponsors it's all about the sponsor you're fundamentally beholden to your advertisers  and television and then you have those advertisers to consider because that's going to interact that 
[03:41:30]  intersect into your program every you know x amount of minutes boom your show's going to shut off and  then there's going to be dancing fucking lizards that are selling and that's the most important  thing to consider right because if you can't get the advertisers to come in you can't get the budget  to make the show which means that you can't build an audience which means that you're not going to get  the ratings that you need but fundamentally you've got to keep the advertisers so you are i think the  bottom line for most tv is being beholden to those advertisers but then you have something like hbo that 
[03:42:00]  produces something like game of thrones and it becomes massively popular it's a brilliant show incredibly well  done and then you say oh wait a minute there's that too but that is not being represented that that  that type of art form is not being represented on regular television because of the restrictions  because it couldn't be exactly the delivery method is just so fucked up that's i think more of the  issue than the dumbing down of people because things like podcasts are a perfect example of why 
[03:42:30]  that's that it's not the case that it's just you're not reaching those people you're not stimulating  those people like podcasts are reaching more and more people every day and one of the reasons  being is that they're completely uncensored but i still i mean this is my fear and i don't want to be  cynical and i don't want to be negative but like you take you take the number of people that you reach  in a podcast and compare it to the number of people tune in every night to  fucking two and a half men right and it's like depressing to see the difference in the just sheer  quantity of people tuning in and i completely agree that the world of podcasts and the world of hbo 
[03:43:00]  which is this beautiful kind of you know only subscription television so we don't give a  shit about the advertisers the way that the hbo model right is to hire a production company somebody  pitches them a show they love the show the production company believes in it they hire them  and they're very hands-off they're like you sold us a show that you thought would be brilliant we  want to give you a chance show us how brilliant it is and it works i mean it very much works  because they don't get in there and fuck everything up like they do on most networks 
[03:43:30]  um and yes there's a small portion of the population who who just eats that up and i think that we are  probably those people i think that your listeners are those i think everybody listening to the show  right now is like oh fuck yeah you know i loved breaking bad or i've been breaking that is actually  a really interesting example because it was on um cable television walking dead used to be that  example i think like the first season was just absolutely amazing and brilliant and also on  television with commercials now it's kind of shit i don't watch it so i don't know it's falling  apart i know but a lot of people still love it so well i still i'm a like a person in an abusive 
[03:44:00]  relationship i'll still tune in when it comes back again i'm the same way with like there's a handful  of shows like that i'm like that with girls i watch girls on hbo even though i'm like i don't even  know if i like this but i'm gonna keep watching it i think the delivery method is just what's really flawed  and i think there's also the the non-interactive quality of of television where you just sit there  and the the best you can do is go on a blog somewhere and and you know and and bitch about  it but no i know it's like we've got i feel like the networks have to understand that second screen 
[03:44:30]  viewing is like the way of the future like if if you want for television to actually work because  as we know it's sort of dying and like the web is really kind of i think picking up that slack but  if you do want to maintain uh function in in the television sphere and this is where i work like  obviously i want to maintain function in the in the tv sphere even though i'm perfectly happy to  do a lot of cool stuff in web too i have a lot of fun i like to kind of balance my time with it  you've got to understand how to integrate those two things you've got to understand that most people 
[03:45:00]  nowadays while we're watching tv we're multitasking it's very rare there's a handful of shows where like  true detective now right on hbo it's like the new there's three episodes so far when it's time to  watch true detective i hit play on my dvr and i'm like pissed if the phone ring you know what i mean i'm like  focused i'm not picking up my phone and checking my email every five so i'm really focused but  that's like one hour every week the rest of the time if i am watching tv at all i'm on my phone i'm  on my laptop doing work i need to be able to do other things at the same time and so if there's a way 
[03:45:30]  to have the second screen functionality i'm watching tv and then i have like things on my tv or things on  my phone that will contribute to my experience watching this show i'll engage in that what do you mean by  that like like a show like what how could you ever have that so like let's say that you know like my  show um on on pivot tv so i do a show called take part live and it's nightly and it um up until 
[03:46:00]  yesterday actually we were shooting it completely live so we're shooting at 9 p.m um on the west  coast midnight on the east coast and because of the live component people can tweet us people can interact  we have these panel discussions we can like in real time like look at social media and say oh so  and so is saying this like how do you respond to that which i think is really cool because we're all  living in a world now where like we want more customized entertainment you know what i mean because  it's capable we have a capability for it now and so i think watching tv and knowing that tv is going 
[03:46:30]  to reflect the questions that we have is really interesting and now we're shooting live to tape which i think  even actually allows more flexibility so we shoot a little bit earlier in the day by the time it airs  we've already shot it but we can have sourced all of this cool social component so like one of the  things that we do is a segment called viewers like you where uh let's say you watch an episode and we  have this really great panel on like guantanamo bay and then you know somebody's watching is like  you never answered this one question that's always bugged me about guantanamo bay so they like skype in 
[03:47:00]  they record a little question then we have the expert on the panel who can answer that question  directly and we can pop it on the air so just even baby steps like that i think are really  important when you're watching tv but i also think that there's a way to do it wrong and i think that's  what a lot of these um talking head like news networks do like cnn msnbc like it's not social  interaction if you just have a twitter ticker on the bottom of the screen that's like the  laziest way it's noise it's just noise it's just there's like tickers everywhere sorry there's 
[03:47:30]  tickers like everywhere and i just i can't even focus at that point yeah the ticker thing drives  me fucking crazy they do that on sports shows like uh if you're watching fights a lot of times like  while the fights are going on there's a ticker underneath it's showing like football scores  and baseball scores and this guy's out because his knees hurt and like yeah and then also like  you've got like joe schmoe number two says i can't believe he blew out his knee and you're like  i don't give a shit oh the tweets yeah oh jesus christ i don't care but i think we're talking about 
[03:48:00]  completely different genres because that wouldn't work with like a sitcom or that wouldn't work with  yeah that's true yeah scripted entertainment is a completely different arena and that's an arena  that i don't work in you know i work in unscripted television which is a totally different thing i  think that the problem with scripted television right now is like you said if you are beholden to the  advertisers you're basically beholden to fear and there is a bad habit i think in television right  now where a network executive wants the third fourth and fifth version of the same show because 
[03:48:30]  oh that's that worked one time let's try it again let's try it again and then they like run it into  the ground instead of we want something that's new and innovative and out of step with what we all see  because this it's too expensive of a risk to take if this show fails we're out millions of dollars and  it's just it's not feasible for their network so there's a lot of fear that comes along with taking  intense risks whereas hbo doesn't even give a shit about any of all they need to do is maintain 
[03:49:00]  their subscriptions because they're much more interested in how they're received critically  they would much rather get 20 emmys than get you know x amount of viewers that doesn't matter to them  they have a set number of subscriptions they'd love it if subscriptions went up but for the most part  they understand that only a certain type of person is ever going to be able to afford they've got to  already pay for cable they've got to be able to pay for an expanded package and you know they know the  stats on their subscribers so they want to make quality television but like you said you're beholden 
[03:49:30]  to the advertisers that fear i think in some ways is what fuels this fundamental dumbing down of america  because instead of saying we're going to create content from an editorial perspective that we think  would be beneficial they say what do you want to see and this is huge in the news arena this is the  real problem in the news arena in america instead of saying this is what's happening in the world  i'm giving you a platform so that you can see what's happening in the world i've worked as a  journalist for many years so i have the editorial distinction or discretion to be able to say this 
[03:50:00]  is what's important to share the news people now are saying what do you want us to talk about  what's interesting to you and then you end up having this like negative feedback of like  shit going down the toilet it's so dangerous i was watching cnn headline news and they had a poll  who do you think is a better person britney spears or paris hilton it was a fucking poll it's insane  they broke in you think yeah they broke in on cnn mm and and ms uh fuck msnbc when bieber got arrested 
[03:50:30]  they like broke into actual news to give us this update because it's so fucking important that we  know to the minute well i believe the cnn one with msnbc i think they were talking about the nsa  oh my god it's hilarious that they broke in it's the ultimate distraction yeah here's a little  hairless boy and that's the thing that's like so it's so funny that i i feel like anybody who was  alive in the 50s who is still alive to this day who was reading the sci-fi authors that i 
[03:51:00]  now love like vonnegut and orwell and and they they were warned about this dystopian future how  many of those things are just coming to fruition all the time you know this big brother mentality  this like fundamental we're going to keep you distracted and keep you lazy and and try and  like eliminate any sort of ability for massive revolution it's like it's just so scary that's  the world we live in do you think i don't think distractions are engineered i don't think that 
[03:51:30]  there's some like mass conspiracy that there's like five people at the top with like nefarious  mustaches you know saying this is how we're going to control everybody but i do think that what  happens is that money money comes into it and power comes into it and people desperately people with  money and power desperately don't want to lose it people who don't have money or power desperately  want to gain it and so the system is really fixed in a fucked up way where egalitarian values and  socialist values are not respected in this country because you know you see it all the time people 
[03:52:00]  voting against their own interests because not because they fundamentally believe that you know  this fat cat politician who's trying to pass policy that keeps the little guy down and that like  really intensifies the income inequality in this country they don't believe oh that's like morally  the way we should go they believe well one day i'm going to be rich and i want to make sure that  the laws protect me yeah it's it's horrible and i think that the one thing that maybe we can say is  more engineered than other is this concept of the american dream this really fucked up concept and 
[03:52:30]  they shouldn't be a template for all of us to live our lives by we shouldn't all be like hoping and  praying that one day we're going to strike it rich and we're going to go from you know this place to  that place it should be much more piecemeal we should be living in a country where it's plausible that  you can work really hard in your life and you can actually make a make a life for yourself and maybe get  out of a situation get in a slightly better situation this has been the joe rogan experience  expand further into the rogan universe at joe rogan.net and listen every saturday at 11 a.m and
