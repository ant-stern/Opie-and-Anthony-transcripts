<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a fake Twitter account impersonating SiriusXM’s Scott Greenstein, speculating on its likely creator being a disgruntled former employee.  The fake tweets included complaints about lukewarm Hawaiian Punch in the office. The conversation then transitioned to a scathing critique of the NBC Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony, targeting the performances of Carole King, Michael Bublé, Al Roker, and expanding to include negative commentary on Justin Bieber, Neil Diamond, and Tony Bennett's singing abilities.  A significant portion played and mocked Justin Bieber's rendition of "Little Drummer Boy," filled with profanity and sarcasm.  A listener called in about Bieber’s changing voice and his daughter’s changing musical tastes, sparking further speculation about Bieber's career and the rise of future teen idols.  The show briefly touched upon Jason Ellis and potential legal troubles, mentioning Dane Cook as an upcoming guest, and concluded this segment with discussion of the Rockettes' Radio City Christmas Spectacular, focusing on the dancers' physical strain and further commentary on the Christmas Tree Lighting and various celebrities.

The show then shifted to a tribute to the late Patrice O'Neal, filled with anecdotes and offensive language.  The hosts shared numerous stories, including one about Louis C.K. repeatedly yelling "fuck dad" while with his daughters, and another about Bobby Kelly's excessive profanity frustrating Louis C.K.  A bit about a listener, "Stalker Patty," hallucinating after consuming a THC edible was also included.  Comedian James Norton was a guest, his interview punctuated by the hosts' frequent use of verbal fillers.  A significant portion was dedicated to replaying and discussing a host's mistake of referring to John Walsh as his murdered son, Adam Walsh.  The hosts also discussed the NFL fining Plaxico Burress, debated sportsmanship across different sports, and explored reasons for varying sports viewership. Jay Oakerson called in with more stories about Patrice O'Neal and the impact of his death.  Jason Ellis then joined the show, discussing his new song about naked jet skiing and his recent rehab stay.

Jason Ellis remained a guest for a considerable portion of the show, discussing his separation from his wife, his sex addiction stemming from childhood molestation, his infidelity, rehab, and the fallout with his wife. He detailed his therapy, including frequent contact with a sex therapist and life coach.  He also discussed his career, including his radio show, TV projects (including one with Bam Margera and Tony Hawk), and his band Death, Death, Die's new album, *Ninja Flying Eagles*. He expressed frustration with his label.  Ellis recounted a graphic story about a woman using heroin in his Hard Rock Hotel room and discussed his father's violent temper and his own self-destructive behaviors.  His manager, Jonathan, joined, sharing anecdotes from his travels, particularly Uzbekistan.  Dane Cook then entered the studio.  The hosts briefly discussed the recent death of a friend, and the conversation concluded with further discussion of Ellis's career and future plans.

Dane Cook became the primary guest for a segment dedicated to remembering Patrice O'Neal.  He shared anecdotes about O'Neal's early career, his blunt honesty, and comedic genius, including a story about O'Neal's advice on embracing the truth.  The conversation included discussions of O'Neal's final days and death, Cook's frustration at lacking a final meaningful conversation with him, O'Neal's relationship with his girlfriend Vaughn, and his complicated relationships within the comedy world.  They discussed the hacking of O'Neal's posthumous Twitter account and the resulting inappropriate tweets, as well as news reports mistakenly stating his age as 14.  Cook promoted his new movie, "Answers to Nothing," detailing its dark themes. The conversation concluded with further reminiscing about O'Neal, including his performances, interactions with other comedians (Gallagher and Pat Cooper), and his upcoming posthumous album "Mr. P," with a track from the album being played.  Cook also briefly discussed his year-long break from comedy and his video game experiences.

The final segment continued the tribute to Patrice O'Neal, with Dane Cook still present.  They discussed O'Neal's upcoming album, *Mr. P*, and movie, *Scout Masters*, and the donation of proceeds to his family.  Stories included O'Neal's lunch with Brooke Shields, a video of him falling into a camera, and his hat-based mood indicators.  His outspokenness and a contentious exchange with Gallagher, marked by offensive language and racial humor, were highlighted.  Sam Roberts discussed his financial situation, mentioning his engagement ring and wedding bands, and jokingly demanded a raise. The segment concluded with promotional plugs for O'Neal's work and the show, transitioning to Ron and Fez.

[00:04:00]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money  and I fuck attractive girls  and little Jimmy  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little  what?  don't listen to the dang over here  stop with that shit  I know, here they are  why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, god damn it  but enough of this palaver  let's get the show on the road  yeah  hi everybody 
[00:04:30]  is it gone?  oh boy  I just want to go on record  and say I don't know anything about it  no?  I didn't do shit  it's definitely gone?  yeah  okay  because I  I wouldn't be surprised if they're pointing their fingers at us  they are  I don't know if they are 
[00:05:00]  officially they are?  I don't know if they are  a lot of people  a lot of people?  is it definitely gone?  I'm  I'm 99% sure it's gone  I'm  somebody  somebody  and you gotta think it's an inside job  started a  Scott Greenstein Twitter feed  yeah  and I don't  I really don't know if the guy has a sense of humor  I have no idea  I've never had like a  a quality conversation with the man  but  it was hilarious 
[00:05:30]  the fake Scott Greenstein Twitter account was hilarious  is he mad or  or  or  understanding that it's just a joke  there were rumors that  uh  there was time spent yesterday trying to get it  taken down  oh really?  I mean I don't know for a fact  I didn't even know it existed  I would have liked to  people around  people around here did because there was  accusations being flung  toward us?  around everybody yesterday 
[00:06:00]  I'm going on record  I have  I don't think  nothing to do with it  and  and as I know  I don't think anyone from the show has anything to do with it  no  I would bet money  no one from the show has anything to do with it  was it uh  derogatory or was it silly?  it was silly  it was goofy  yes  it was  it was pretty damn funny  I was  I was going to bring it to everyone's attention yesterday  but then you know  was it obvious it wasn't him?  because that's like  a big thing  like  if it's just such a parody  and a goof  it's kind of silly  yeah  it was  it was a definite parody 
[00:06:30]  yeah  oh yeah  it was a big time parody  yeah  and now it's been taken down?  I believe so  I can't remember specific tweets  uh  at this time  but uh  I don't know  what were some of them?  vagueness  we're saying  it's not vague  we're saying  there was a  how was it vague?  there was a fake  uh  the guy that runs programming here  at SiriusXM  had a fake Twitter account  and it seemed like it was an inside job  this is something that has been going on  in a lot of companies lately  dummies 
[00:07:00]  yeah  they get these fake  kind of uh  Twitter accounts for the big boss  and just beat the shit out of them  but then IP addresses get checked  oh yeah  it's gotta be easy to catch someone  doing this shit  of course  it's a stupid thing to do  I got very nervous  I was caught in the crosshairs  I'm clean on this one Sam  I didn't do shit  I got tweeted at  by the account  I think that's why people think that  oh I  so did I  okay  yeah that's the only reason I know about it  and then I started howling  and then I wanted to tell these guys about it  and then  you know  unfortunately the whole Patrice thing went down  so  um 
[00:07:30]  I don't know  there was a tweet about him just outside staring at a Christmas tree  going  maybe I should go in and do some work now  oh no  I've been out here for hours  staring at this Christmas tree  but it was really specific  like I  it was  if it wasn't somebody who works here  yeah  somebody who works here was telling a person what to write  oh  you know what it was funny  uh huh  whoever did it it was funny  Liam was blaming E-Rock  I don't think it was E-Rock  nah  too clever for E-Rock  ouch 
[00:08:00]  sorry E-Rock  is E-Rock  E-Rock's not like that though is he  no  E-Rock's not that kind of guy  clever  no but  he's not  but he's more of a lumbering  Fred Gwynn  but E-Rock's not  it beats a fat joke  it does beat a fat joke  although it was heavy  that's how you walk through the door  but he's the deceptive  no  I would bet money  it's someone that used to work here  that's you know  still holding some kind of a  a grudge or whatever  that could definitely be  I would bet money  cause you'd be crazy to  to you know  start that up  if you still work here 
[00:08:30]  cause the info  I guess  I've been told  is pretty specific  and only an insider  would know that shit  yeah  like Hawaiian Punch  being warm or something  yeah there was like  complaints about  warm Hawaiian Punch  what  which is one of the drinks  we have in the fridge  in the kitchen  oh wow  I thought it was a Christmas party  is that his go to drink  I have no idea  that's very specific  yeah I don't know anything  about the man  but the fact that  Hawaiian Punch was mentioned  and it's not like  shows here on the platform  spend a great deal of time  talking about the fact  that there's Hawaiian Punch  in our kitchen 
[00:09:00]  right  means that it's probably  someone who's been in our kitchen  yeah  oh god  it's just not worth the risk  we're not being vague  we're not being vague  this is a way to attack bosses  people set up fake Twitter accounts  and then the whole office  starts howling  I literally haven't heard of it  until you mention it  I know  I wish I would have seen it  all us low tier people  were all buzzing about it  yesterday  oh you were all  a buzz  trying to figure out who it was  all a light  I bet you all hell broke loose  as everyone had to stop  doing what they were doing  to make sure this was 
[00:09:30]  shut down  I don't know what  upper management thinks  but everybody on the  lower tier of things  that I speak to  all thought  it was somebody  in the O&A camp  I would bet  one to two people  were pissed off  and that's it  I would bet money on that  yeah  it's probably the wrong  one to two people though  yeah that's true  and I think it's more one  yeah  I'm just throwing maybe two  so I guess it's shut down  so we can't even read the tweets  no unfortunately not 
[00:10:00]  I really want to know  who it was  people are blaming Roland  no  yeah Roland was  brought up a few times  but I said  if it were Roland  it would have been  littered with spelling errors  yeah  that's so  it's not Roland  if it were anybody  on our staff  or our team  everybody else on the staff  would know about it  because we'd all be  that's true  everybody would be in it together  yeah yeah  and I mean it's not  oh well  it's gone anyway so  water under the bridge  so 
[00:10:30]  yeah  c'est la vie  how's everyone doing  all right  yeah  I'm all  I'm all  aglow with the Christmas spirit  after watching the  wonderful tree lighting  on NBC last night  wow  I wanted a live  star studded  I wanted a live tweet  that last night  but I was in no mood  it was  I couldn't resist  I didn't even want to  I was compelled  yeah  to tweet a couple of times  and and watch this  this 
[00:11:00]  disaster of  boredom  can I  can I start by saying this  because I know where you're going with it  yeah  with it  can we all acknowledge  and this is going to be old school  that Carole King can't sing anymore  no  holy fuck  wow  was that awful  she can't fucking sing  no  that was terrible  and she's a legend  in the  in the female singing category  I think she needed some effects  on that thing  well  they introduced Carole King  to sing a dopey number  and then there's another broad on stage  that they don't even introduce 
[00:11:30]  so  so she could help her along  with the song  and harmonize a little bit  helping her out  sangin  who was that broad  I don't know  she had  she had a major role  in the song they sang  she was terrible  and then fucking  who else was  just  that Michael Buble  is like  fucking  Ambien  like Ambien  he's a crooner  did you notice his  his  birds  fly  he didn't sing that  did you notice his  leather suit  was a bit tight  his leather suit 
[00:12:00]  was a bit tight  was very tight  and the reason  the reason  it was tight  is because he's  he's one of those  skinny fat guys  yeah  yeah  you know what I mean  yeah  like he should have  just got a bigger  size suit  and the crooning  thing is so bad  he was like  chestnuts  roasting  oh the weather  outside  is frightful  but fire  fire is so delightful  and since we've  no place to go

[00:13:30]  soaking through  their jeans  their mom jeans  are all wet  that's terrible  and Eric has to  go with them  and he's just  rolling his eyes  the whole time  like oh god  why can't  I be  more like  Michael DuPle  why do they  love him  I have no idea  I don't know  I don't get it  they just go  every time  he's in  do you hate  when they make  you go to the show  because you overhear  them saying things  like I'm creaming  my jeans  would they try to 
[00:14:00]  hijack the  Prince DuPle  seed  I'm sure  they say vulgar  things  they don't realize  Eric can hear  them  in their mom  jeans  I'd let them  come in my  mouth  would you  pretend he  didn't hear it  exactly  you know like  Michael Buble  Michael Buble  was so  boring

[00:34:00]  that's my favorite version of the dumb song  is it  yeah man  i like stevie's  well why don't we go to the old piano  and sing us a song about beating the kids  and punching the wife  and drinking whiskey  and having cigarette  drinking bourbon  cigarette  yeah  singing with cigarette breath  and yellow tea  you think that dumb sweater of bing smelled  oh god  nicotine and what  child's tears 
[00:34:30]  you know how many times  wife's blood  a sad face in that sweater  while a spanking was commencing  as he was like missing and hitting their little child legs  because he was drunk  oh  yeah  white america's gone  it's gone

[00:35:30]  merrily to be believed  you wanna help at all  he's trying to sound so black  it's like jimmy with a kengo hat  leave him alone  I'm a boy so do it  do it  hey  hey  hey  come on  I'm a boy so do it  do it 
[00:36:00]  I'm a boy so do it  do it  I'm a boy so do it  do it  come on  I'm a boy so do it  Justin Bieber  thank you so much for coming man  we lost you yesterday  Justin Bieber  really?  can you imagine him knowing five years ago  he'd be yelling that into a microphone  Justin Bieber  I don't like Buster Rhymes  because he was a dick to me when I met him  so I don't like him at all  so I'm glad to see this 
[00:36:30]  even though he's succeeding  I'm glad to see you yelling  and playing backup  to this sissy boy  sissy boy  you're a real gangster  he's a tough guy  and he's playing backup  are we just too old to get this shit?  no  sometimes I have to ask myself that now  no  because I could  you know  I could see something  and realize  wow there's some talent there  even if I don't get it  but you know  Usher comes out  and sings his ass off  makes Bieber look like an idiot  Bieber doesn't know how to rap  like Buster Rhymes does 
[00:37:00]  but Buster Rhymes comes out and raps  so I guess  I guess Buster's doing a great job with that  and then you go back to a weaker version of rap  with Justin Bieber  with that thin voice  corny  and him trying to fucking sound black  putting black  like that inflection  that little lisp  on the end of the voices  yeah  yeah yeah yeah  but it's just  he's a teenager  that's what teenagers do  like you  you try to find  yeah it's just  it'll  it'll bully you  by the time he's 21  he won't be doing that  it's just this little phase  he's going through  he won't be doing anything 
[00:37:30]  he's not going to be doing anything at 21  he's going to be on VH1  doing one of those fucking clip shows  the Hanson brothers were massive  when we were in Boston  hockey  exactly  he's got  I'm telling you  he's got YouTube  and social networking  I think is going to keep people bigger longer  yeah  yeah I really do  he's had the fame long enough  and big enough to  where he won't completely go away  no he won't  but  it's  he's one  YouTube kid away  from fucking  not getting this 
[00:38:00]  adulation  you're right about  people now are realizing  what he sounds like  when he sings  yeah  because before  you just knew who he was  most people who were grown  didn't even know  had never heard a Justin Bieber song  right  now that they're shoving him  in our faces everywhere  people were actually hearing him sing  my parents said the same thing  on Thanksgiving  they were like  our Sam is better  I heard that just  did mother criticize him  because he wasn't Sam  oh Sam  I'm going to break these  JB cookies in half 
[00:38:30]  that I made  this is what I wanted  for you Sam  Sam  he's nobody  he can't even sing Sam  mother  mother he can sing  Sam  what hotel is he hanging out at  they agreed with you  oh they agreed with me  well that's different  sorry  what's the sexy  no  we said that  where's our god damn  cookies Sam  we're not going to get any cookies  cookies  she doesn't want to be  the cookie champion  not after you  your behavior has not  didn't do shit  is not deserving of any cookies 
[00:39:00]  I don't get the beeps  at all  no no  I just get the fact that  he can sing  live especially  it's just terrible  and the problem  with tapping into that  14 year old market  is they're fickle as all hell  they will fucking leave you  high and dry  yeah  when sexy bags comes out  forget about Bieber  he's the next  on to the next thing  can I hear this thing  I'm dreaming of  white chocolate  the other one you were  talking about  you said it's on  it's on it's way up  oh Grayson whatever 
[00:39:30]  there's some  there's some black kid  that's rocking  the YouTube too  I forgot his name  maybe someone can help me out  really  but he really has  he really knows how to  astro  astro  he really knows how to sing  astro  what is that  wrapped around astro's hand  what is astro doing  astro looks like a nerd  he is a dork  astro's a dork  kind of looks like  a chocolate ring  type of guy  chocolate ring  see that was  he was  Tay Zonde  was supposed to be 
[00:40:00]  the next  no he wasn't  everyone knew  that was just  a dumb  YouTube sensation  he's a goof  Tayden  it happens  play drummer boy  what  didn't we just  play it  drummer boy  a listener wants in  a listener  what's up  hey  why don't you guys  go on YouTube  and look up  a brutal Christmas  drummer boy  probably one of the most  hardcore drummer boys  you ever heard  it's drummer  drummer  is it  is it  is it racist  no it's not racist 
[00:40:30]  there's no bad word  it's just  go on YouTube  look up a brutal Christmas  it's kind of like  heavy metal  like death metal  type  drummer  what do you think  we're doing  pendulum here  oh here we go  this is the reality  of the whole thing  Jim go ahead  Jim's got a daughter  Jim's daughter  is 14 years old  go ahead Jim  alright  and easy on the  14 year old jokes  I didn't say anything  well just in case  alright  he told me  that  he was being  interviewed the other day  and he's talking about 
[00:41:00]  how his voice is  developing  which means his voice  is changing  which means his 15 minutes  are at 14 and counting  happy birthday  Jimmy  punchin' out  wait but your daughter  doesn't like him anymore  damn it too  your call was a waste  if you're still listening  your call was a waste  worst calls ever  you didn't say anything  no  the setup was  the only reason  I went to the call  was that  his daughter  used to like  Justin Bieber  doesn't like him anymore  because his voice  is changing  but he didn't say 
[00:41:30]  any of that  yeah  Justin says  his voice  is getting better  oh really  well let's see  what his fans say  he's panicking  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  he's totally  fucking panicking  see what his fans say  I don't think  that's getting better  if he was so great  why did Usher come out  and just fucking  sing with him yesterday  yeah  I mean I know  they sing together  but he's at the point  where he should be like  okay  just doing his own thing  and maybe  Usher brought him in  and now  okay now go off  and do your thing  yeah but every  fucking time he's out there  there's gotta be 
[00:42:00]  an Usher fucking tie in  you think he'll be  on the Bieber Christmas special  isn't there gonna be  a Bieber Christmas special too  I hope so  I got a Thanksgiving special  I saw the Buble  advertisement  for the Buble Christmas  which just looks like  fucking  sleeping pills  it just  it's so bad  what Buble  Buble  don't forget my father  my father  wow  hello  my sister  my sister loves  it's  it's just this  slow motion shit 
[00:42:30]  listen to this  listen  listen here we go  yeah  Buble  I'm dreaming  tonight  that's a hell of a voice  here  of a place  I love  thanks  even more  than I do  you don't like  this shit  do you  it's so dull  I don't mind  dull sometimes  no I don't mind  mellow  I don't mind  mellow  I mind dull  this is dull  you can tell he has a great voice  though  he does but it's terrible  for a crooner  he says his S is like chip 
[00:43:00]  well the lisp  is a little  fucking awful  the lisp is a little rough  at times  I had to point that out  to my sister  now she's pumped out  she noticed it now  yeah  birds fly  click  they all just want to fuck him  that's all it is  well he's getting a little  I hope the nagle women aren't listening  yeah  exactly  but Buble's suits are getting a little tight 
[00:43:30]  yeah yeah  I mean  Buble's eating well  we're google imaging him  he didn't look like that last night  his suits are getting tight  yeah  bunch of wet panties right now  in Florida  oh boy  the home of the nagle  they're up here in Jersey  sopping underwear  Florida  leaky thighs  West Palm is just  West Palm is uh  yeah  I think their bunts are getting a little bit  oh yeah  Jesus  what the fuck  what the fuck  they're rubbing their legs together  right  he's got the same look as Eric though  that's the Eric eyes  Eric you know what 
[00:44:00]  he really does  Buble could be your brother  especially the uh  the younger version of Buble  he's got the heavy eyes  let's put up a younger version of E-Rock  remember when he was  in shape when he first started here  I bet Sam could find this pretty quickly  before this fucking place just  took his soul  he knows where all the bag's pictures are  let's go side to side  I'm thinking uh  E-Rock might look like  he could be related to the  the boobs  the Buble's  I don't know  that didn't work  I tried though  no that's not  Christmas  listen to this 
[00:44:30]  it's fucking  infuriatingly boring  my point being  yeah  if Justin Bieber had a voice like this  he would sing drummer boy  easy  you know what I mean  yeah  Buble's not gonna fucking end it up  no no  throw all that nonsense  he's not  he doesn't have to throw in the rap  alright  we got Bedroom Eye  Z-Rock on the right here  ok  for the people out there in Radioland  and then we got  holy shit  you guys could be rolling  yeah look at that  yeah there's definitely 
[00:45:00]  something going on there  you look like his brother  with Down Syndrome  oh shit  oh that's  no actually  I apologize  but it goes back to  it's great  it goes back to a bit  me and Ant used to do  where like when you know  like a really famous  like celebrity  and then you  then you see their brother on TV  and it always looks so  fucking weird  looks like the retarded version  the Clint Howard version  and it works for you  not even Clint Howard  you gotta go  the go-to's for us was  Tom Hanks 
[00:45:30]  and Patrick Swayze  Swayze yeah  they looked sort of like  their you know  their real famous brother  yeah Swayze's brother  that was totally  Swayze retarded  yeah  that's where I was  going for Iraq  I'm sorry  but it works in this case  because Iraq does look like  he has Down Syndrome  just like a little  you're not helping  yeah I'm sorry  you're not  you think you are  but you're not  those big dumb dark circles  oh  dude you sure you're not  related to Buble  hey man  oh I hope I am  I'll get the hell out of here  with that money  what would you do with this  why would he just give you money  yeah why would he give you money  exactly  they pay all the retarded brothers 
[00:46:00]  to stay out of the limelight  fucking  damn Iraq  that's a good point  I'm dreaming of a thin brother  I'm not supposed to say that  out loud ever  that's funny  alright  so the Christmas fucking  yeah that was the lighting  and of course  it's that whole  build up to nothing  they flip a switch  and everybody goes  woo  half a million people showed up  half a million people  were down streets  that you can't even see  the train  that's what I was saying 
[00:46:30]  to my sister  we were kind of watching it  together last night  and I'm like  I know that area  they said they were all the way  up to 51st Street  I'm like you can't see shit  on 51st Street  you're not gonna see the tree  I went to leave yesterday  and they had it all blocked  you had to go up to 57th  just to go to the tunnels  did Obama go there or no  he was somewhere in Midtown  but he wasn't near the tree  no he was having a fundraiser  did they have big screens set up  so the people that were not close  could see shit  how about at that point  you go home and watch it on TV  exactly  why be on the cold 
[00:47:00]  I don't get it  and then they had the fucking  dumb Rockettes out there  and all we were thinking was  they gotta be cold  like the chilly vaginas  they're doing the kick line  and all I'm thinking is  how chilly their vagina  because even a young vagina  has always got a little moisture in it  and when they're doing that kick line  that famous Rockette kick line  I'm just thinking  it's gotta be chilly on that fluid  they actually talked about that  they wear cunt muffs  which is like a little fur liner  for the panty 
[00:47:30]  cunt muffs  they have a big box of cunt muffs  imagine what those would smell like  after their kick line all day  they used once  like daily contact lenses  and throw it out  cunt muffs  you can just let it steep in water  like tea  where you heat it on a radiator  and it holds heat  for a few hours  there they are  look at the Rockettes  can I teach you something  about the kick line  that my sister told me  oh  a little tidbit  you know that they  they don't hold each other  what do you mean  you know when they're like 
[00:48:00]  doing the kick line  and their arms are behind  they're not really touching each other  you know  it looks like they're all in one  in unison  like holding on to each other  yeah  they're not actually holding on  why  because  because  I guess it would fuck up the rhythm  oh let me see  go to the part where they do the kick line  it's so famous  I guess it was part of a special  or something on the Rockettes  there they go  and they  they actually are not  holding each other  it looks like it obviously  right  yeah  they're not  they're not holding each other  they're not even fucking holding each other 
[00:48:30]  look at all that gash  stuff with cotton balls  to keep them warm  I like it  it's sort of like a goose step thing  that's not what it's intended to be  no it is  you think they're goers  I don't know  I don't know what to make of the Rockettes  by the way Roland  if you care about me  you will get me some Rockettes tickets  are you gonna go to that fucking thing  no no I swear I won't go  I went  I gotta get it for the family  remember when I was roped in  pronto  to go with the ex-wife Judy and Annie Marg

[01:06:30]  because he didn't  want his  classmates to  know because  he was kind  of embarrassed  oh  so he changed  his name  you know  because they were  they were printing  up his lines all  the time in the  newspaper when  newspapers really  matter the  newspaper  what's his  name uh  that winchell  yeah i think  i think so  extra extra  read all about  it  i think he  wrote for  sid cesar too  i could be  wrong  yeah he did  yeah he did  he was part of  uh the great  writers for that  show which was  also um  what's his name

[01:08:30]  decapitated was the word  you were trying to get  fired i guess huh  no i wasn't trying to get  fired it was a mistake  no that's  oh was it  that's calculated  what a blunder  by the way the other  writer  the other writer  i couldn't believe  i just heard that  the other writer  was mel brooks  oh jesus  a little man named  mel brooks  thank you  there was two other  famous writers with him  as well  yeah  larry gelbert from mash  oh yeah sure  and uh neil simon  love on the rocks  oh  it's different  so what  timmy was in  and uh

[01:11:30]  by the way  you know  i just couldn't  like of all the  names there's  there's a million  names and the  one you shouldn't  mention  right  was that one  well i knew  you could have  said bartholomew  i knew his name  yeah  it's just we had  been talking about  adam wallace  had we  had a  you're just an  idiot  yeah  you're just kind  of an idiot  there sam  he was such a  nice man  was he cool  oh my god  was he great  fucking great talker  because he's even  done a million  interviews  yes  you know he's a  guy who's gotten  a lot of shit  accomplished  he's a great  interviewer 
[01:12:00]  dedicating his  life to  getting scum  off the streets  how long was the  show off the air  because we used to  joke all the time  like who's gonna be  the asshole tv  executive that  takes that show  off the tv  you can't take a  show like that  off tv  when it's helping  so many people  it's public service  it's a public  service you're right  i let jim do most  of the heavy lifting  oh you did  yeah  well  after you handle  the questions  drop the heavy  lifting on your  foot  yeah  um  you are an ass  that's accurate 
[01:12:30]  you guys remember  um stevie johnson  doing the  plaxico burst  oh he doesn't  have to call him  johnson  yes  make him believe  he shot himself  in the leg  after scoring  the touchdown  yeah  the buffalo  bills  sure  yeah  the fucking  nfl  fined him  ten thousand  dollars  oh that's not  even that  grand  it's not bad  but it's the fact  that they're  fining him over  that because  i would ask  the nfl today  and i wish i could  get someone on the  phone  who was offended  by that  that you have  to fine him  ten thousand  dollars  who was offended  not plaxico  what is that 
[01:13:00]  hurting  he laughed  plaxico said he  wasn't even offended  said he thought it  was funny  water under the  bridge  he said he got a  good laugh out of  it and water under  the bridge  yeah  so so why are you  finding the guy  what is the logic  there  i guess they want to  keep their peeps in  line  they had a the the  slave master had to  get the whip out and  give a give them a  couple of lashes  but everyone enjoyed it  and the ones that  don't enjoy something  like that you shouldn't  be paying attention to  them  you know  it's just about  consistency  they need to keep  them all all in 
[01:13:30]  check  no celebrating like  that in the end  zone  why  because it's too  much fun  it's too interesting  for the viewer  i don't know why  they just want to  keep it  might as well make  them wear suits and  ties on the field  oh  jesus christ  seriously  suits and ties  that would be funny  if they all had  giant blazers  but i mean you  know they're trying  to get this like  this high class  respecting it's  fucking football  man  they've taken a lot 
[01:14:00]  of the fun out of  things  they should allow  all of it  because guess what  if the other team  is a little pissed  off because you're  celebrating a little  too much  they're gonna take  care of their own  i think it's part of  the game too  it's part of like  the that whole  you know kind of  fucking with the  other team a little  psyching them out  doing shit  rubbing it in  you know can the  team either look  at it and be  demoralized and do  shittier or kind of  you know right  step it up and  make them look  stupid for celebrating  like that yeah you  know sportsmanship 
[01:14:30]  sucks it really does  in the end it sucks  it it it it's it's not  good for the fans  i mean obviously you  can't have a guy you  know clotheslining one  of the players or  something but uh  shit like that you  know i mean a little  shit talking you know  i'm a huge hockey fan  hockey does it right  they still allow way  more in their sport than  other sports right  they still allow the  fighting and stuff  like that and  they'll have brutal  brutal games you  know the playoffs and  stuff and at the end  of the series they  they shake hands  yeah i like that  that kind of 
[01:15:00]  sportsmanship i like  but the other shit  they just allow the  game they just allow  it who's on the  hotline hotline  who's on the  mother-hugging  fuck is this  line what the hell  is this uh  does just have more  info on the uh  adam walsh  justin oh  probably not  they only find them  because it involved a  gun  who's this  a fake hand  like a finger  and a thumb  gun  yeah but it was  still promoting 
[01:15:30]  using a gun  and they're trying to  clean up their image  of being gangbangers  oh come on  stop i can't believe  that really  come on  that's why it was  only 10 grand  oh i wonder  is that is that the  official statement  i don't think so  justin i'm not  taking your word for  it sir  that's just  that's what they  were saying on all  the talk shows  yesterday  oh the sports talk  shows  so this is second  hand info  they had to find  him something  because it involved  a gun 
[01:16:00]  so they made it a  minimal amount for  him  who knows  yeah right  all right  we can we can  handle a gun  bit  yeah  a fake  hand  right  a gun made  from your hand  right  is uh silly  mocking something  that happened  like he brought  out a player  on the other  team  yeah  one of the  jets offensive  linemen claimed  it was it was  very insensitive  because uh  he crashed a jet  which reminded him  of 9-11  ew  oh yeah  what a dick 
[01:16:30]  why why would  you say that  like you know  he's not doing  a not  not a  i could see  if he had  two of his  fucking players  standing there  like towers  and he ran  into them  and they fell  right right  they do a big  stage production  reminded me of  9-11  well tough shit  then i guess  you should never  board a plane  because that  might remind  you of a  9-11  those are the  people we should  not be paying  attention to  in this society  let them be  fucking miserable  somewhere else  don't give him  a fucking voice  huh  the guy is a  mormon from 
[01:17:00]  utah  oh shut up  live in new  york  right  when it  happened  and he goes  said it was  very insensitive  it was uh  puha is his  name  how about that  how about that  all right  justin thank you  for the info  man  thanks guys  watch out  all right  uh what has  better ratings  hockey or the  nfl  obviously the nfl  joe what are you  getting at  what are you  getting at  joe  joe what are you  getting at  what am i  getting at 
[01:17:30]  you say  hockey is this  great league  nobody watches  it  i wouldn't say  no one's  watching i mean  football has  better ratings  sure  of course  nobody  so so you  don't so you  don't want so  you don't want  your nfl players  celebrating on the  field is that  what you're getting  at  no but i'm  saying the nfl  because that's  all i'm talking  about today by  the way  the nfl  obviously is doing  something right  because people  keep watching so  they're keeping it  fan friendly you're  saying they're  not if you  really want  fan friendly 
[01:18:00]  no if you  really want to  argue this point  that the nfl  has 16 fucking  games per team  that's why a  shitload of people  watch every game  matters yeah i think  joe's right here  and i've and i've  explained in the  past like baseball  and basketball and  and hockey if they  knock down the  amount of games they  play in a season  that would that  would help the  sports of course  they have uh  better ratings and  and and more fans  there's only 16  fucking games  only eight home  games that's  crazy but joe your 
[01:18:30]  point is well taken  what are you saying  thank you you can't  compare the two you  idiot  well you just can't  compare the two  now but joe's just  saying that the  ratings are better  right joe  that's correct joe and  i really want to get  into it the reason  hockey doesn't have  good ratings is there's  a bunch of canucks and  rookies running around  nobody can pronounce  their names but oh no  that's not you're racist  no no that's not really  it it's it's a hard  sport to follow on tv  that doesn't help they 
[01:19:00]  even brought in  professionals to try to  figure out how we  could you know watch it  better oh and that  failed miserably yeah  that stupid light the  putt thing that didn't  work very well but  whoosh but joe let me  ask you because you're  a big football fan do  you want these guys  celebrating and and  getting a bit obnoxious  or not i don't mind it  but i understand why  they find them because  they don't want fights  and things like that  fights who cares they  do more damage running 
[01:19:30]  at each other full speed  than a dumb fist fight  with all their equipment  on  yeah that's true  yeah that's true but  pr damage that's the  big damage  puerto rican  pr damage like but  who's offended by this  i want to talk to these  people who's actually  offended nobody  you guys know  sponsored  sponsored  no  well i you know what  i don't even think  they're offended it's  just this very weird  gray area who the  fuck is offended line  them up let's talk  no one no one's  really offended  right 
[01:20:00]  yeah you're right  i think everyone's  just you know scared  yeah the people get  scared that someone  might be offended so  they jump the gun  right  and uh yeah  fine people  all right joe sorry  about yelling  we're being proactive  all right joe in  missouri with some  logic there i guess  hockey ratings are  lower because black  people don't watch  oh  that's a good point  too i mean it's  probably they're not  getting a big black  audience at all  you don't see black  people at hockey games  no  no  women because they 
[01:20:30]  weren't raised on it  i guess like blacks and  women probably don't  watch it as much which  hurts definitely hurts  the numbers  women kind of like  hockey maybe not as  much as other sports  no definitely not as  as much as other sports  but i see them at the  games because you can  look at the buns in  football  you can look at their  buns  i think chicks mostly  probably go to baseball  games  yeah because you can see  the pink hats yeah with  their pink yankee hats  pink and the boyfriends  take the girl to the game  even if the girl isn't  completely interested you  know just to sit there and 
[01:21:00]  yeah you know i just don't  like baseball anymore no i  guess i was fit i guess i  was faking it for a bunch of  years on the radio thinking i  was still a fan and then i  one day woke up and realized  wait a minute you don't like it  you don't like baseball  it's too slow  too many fucking games  i like going to the game  nice day on a nice day i  hate when it rains and you  gotta sit down there in the  rain but well they're a  nice day it's cool you  drink you fucking eat  shitty food and well these  new stadiums are doing it  right because you know now  it becomes a whole day of 
[01:21:30]  oh yeah there's restaurants  museums you can just wander  around  yeah  see they even know  we need more if we're gonna  charge uh you know such a  high ticket price we got to  give these people more things  to do give them shit to do  in the ballpark yeah it's  just sitting and watching the  game yeah it gets a little  much  uh j o okerson was on the  hotline  really is he still there  huh  no he's picking it up  oh god  oh the phones oh what's going 
[01:22:00]  on now someone has to have a  conversation  they're having a conversation  so i can't pick up the guy  who's having a conversation  somebody is like hey how you  doing  if it's if it's him just put  him on hold  who's answering the phones  i think it's  who is who's answering the  phones  matt  oh no  hey asshole why are you  having a conversation  because he was talking  you know  oh  shit 
[01:22:30]  good point matt  oh he's yelling  matt's answering  matt  do you know how to run a  radio show  if someone's calling on the  hotline it doesn't matter if  they're talking you interrupt  them and go okay the you  know what we'll get right to  you  you don't have a conversation  with the guy  shut up  j  wow he's uppity  is this jay okerson  yes it is  hey jay it's been a while  brother  no i feel bad that i got  matt in trouble  fuck matt  no no one really likes him  yeah  i'll be honest with you i was 
[01:23:00]  thinking fuck matt but i didn't  want to go there first  jump on the bandwagon believe  me  you won't be alone  he just irritates everyone  i know about 24 hours late on  the patrice tribute but uh  yeah i know this is  no  it's it's it's still extremely  fresh in everyone's minds  obviously  we're just uh  we're just trying to do some  radio today i guess but  it's  the hardest part to get through  is joe de rosa waxing  prophetic about patrice's  legacy  yeah  that was the thing that made 
[01:23:30]  me the most angry  was that upset you the most  yeah i i understand  i uh i wish i could have  been in the studio but uh  i'm down in dc opening for  jackass estevo i'm not  bragging i'm just telling you  what  oh wow  how's that working out  uh we're gonna see a couple  of staple of my nutsack to my  legs and we'll see what  happens  yeah you're being forced to  do uh some crazy shit  it's almost like it's almost  like an audition for the  fourth movie  yeah  yeah  did you know patrice jay  oh very very well 
[01:24:00]  i was a patrice one of the  first guys who really uh  kind of took me under his  wing and like brought me  rather comfortable with him  so i was  able to have the ability to  learn from like  really one of the best and  i'm really  as everyone is obviously  pretty broken up about this  and uh  i said with on the de rosa  thing i was so  i wanted to call in yesterday  yeah  the figure that de rosa's  laughing  de rosa took maybe some of  the worst beatings  verbally at uh at the voice  of patrice that i've ever  seen somebody take  yeah  and uh and for people who 
[01:24:30]  don't know de rosa what he  looks like he's built like  uh he has a body of a  lowercase i  and uh  i remember patrice telling  him with his uh sloping  shoulders he said uh  joe's dad would never be  able to have a serious  conversation with him  because everything he put  his hand on his shoulder  would just slide off  if he ever wore he can't  wear book bags because  they would just be around  his elbows  having to talk you off a  ledge for 30 minutes  no that means he likes you  man  he likes you 
[01:25:00]  oh shit  that is funny  it was a real rite of  passage to have him bust  your balls when you got  to new york and i uh  i always loved him for  that man i really uh  he's he's missed man  that's  i know it's a big loss for  your guys and the show  and everything and then  and jimmy i know is a  great friend of his and  it's just it's such a  sad it's almost surreal  it doesn't even seem  real yet  you know what made me uh  just hit me again it's  like it's been you know  for the last month we've  known how bad things were  but i was i was thinking 
[01:25:30]  this morning as i was  getting ready and for  some reason platoon  flashed into my head and  i'm like thinking and i'm  like oh that dumb patrice  loved sergeant barnes  oh yeah  he fucking loved to talk  about sergeant barnes and  how he was one of the  greatest characters ever  and he would start a  conversation had nothing  to do with sergeant but  he wanted to talk about  sergeant barnes so he  would just go like what  kind of movies you like  i don't know you like  war movies and then he  would somehow quickly  barrel over you to get  to portray he was doing 
[01:26:00]  a monologue on why  sergeant barnes is one of  the greatest movie  characters of all time  and it's just like little  weird things like that  you can't believe he's  dead like yeah when he  says when you think of  sergeant barnes it's just  a complete association  with patrice yeah he  did i actually did a  break uh here on the  show about that whole  about the platoon and  everything fucking great  i i guess we'll play it  over the weekend over the  weekend it's it's not  going to be just like a  four-hour block the whole  channel is patrice it's  going to be hours and  hours i don't know 16 
[01:26:30]  hours i think they're  talking about at least  16 to 20 hours of  patrice shit on uh the  channel this weekend i  just can't i i just can't  wrap my mind around this  one at all how many  women in that 16 hours  you think jump out of  a fucking window that's  true how many husbands  actually give get the  point and fucking give  their girlfriend a  fucking johnny ola i do  have an ugly pussy and i  am annoying yeah this  this one fucking hurts  people people loved him  and other people hated 
[01:27:00]  him as a performer but  everybody had an opinion  yeah you wouldn't you  never could watch or  listen to patrice without  taking a side like he  forced you to feel one  way or the other yeah  just made you think he  made you think and he  made you feel something  right always it wasn't  just my favorite no  opinion he would do my  favorite thing patrice  would do is when he  would uh insult somebody  you liked so much that  you felt bad at laughing  at the person you like  yeah like i won't say  the comic's name but he  got on a thing one time  at the cellar with  another comic who was 
[01:27:30]  in the same management as  him uh when it was  with the steinbergs i  believe and at the last  the last line of the  argument before it  almost got physical  he goes you should  thank god that i make  enough money so that  steinbergs can afford  stamps to send out your  bullshit tape to people  that was one of the  reasons he had to hold  your face and walk away  so he didn't laugh at  the guy's face  let me that's brutal  i won't say the guy's  name either is it the  same one where he was  saying nobody knows you  you're not you don't  matter is that the 
[01:28:00]  yes i think yeah i i  wasn't even there for  that and i heard about  it oh yeah he just uh  that guy really would  follow patrice around  and try to see every  time that patrice had a  rough time with an  audience yeah i remember  i remember him at the  comic strip saying he's  like yeah patrice is in  there eating shit and  what patrice he wasn't  eating shit he just took  the low road on  everything and uh it  was a time that those  miners uh down south got  uh buried and killed  uh-huh and he was making 
[01:28:30]  fun of that and then some  black lady stood up in the  audience and she goes i  don't think this is  funny my nephew was one  of those miners he was  like what the fuck is a  nigger miner doing in  2006  he said that  and the lady left i'm  like that's not patrice  losing that's him winning  in his mind  yes he was in i told you  i was sitting yesterday i  watched him in stand up  new york just violate an  audience because they were  there to see a blogger and  they weren't going for some 
[01:29:00]  of his rougher stuff and he  just turned and started to  attack the blogger about  how awful he was and the  guy's parents were there  and they got up and left  wow it's one of my  favorite i howled watching  it but he completely wow  completely died but he  won he didn't lose because  i knew what was happening  as a comic he was not  bending to what they wanted  him to bend to yeah he  won't he won't get off the  stage and said he'd rather  everyone leave first yes  yeah he'd stand there in  an empty room and just be  that's it i guess yeah i 
[01:29:30]  guess i'm done my work here  is done everyone's left  angry but walk to the whole  room and he would pull out  money because people would  stand up go i didn't pay 20  bucks to be offended or  whatever so then patrice  would you know grab twenty  dollars go well here's your  twenty dollars back now get  the fuck out he's done that  he did that more than once  shitty drinks yeah yeah  yeah he went up uh he  went up uh cbs comedy club  i remember he was getting  ready for an elephant in the 
[01:30:00]  room and you know he was  doing something a little bit  different where he was  going to stand up and he  wasn't sitting down and he  was trying to go through a  material instead of kind of  just going off the cuff and  i remember he went up on  one night and there was  just like a group of like  ten just dippy shithead  white girls uh in the  front row i think he got  into two lines and he was  trying to get into some  material he's like you know  when you meet a bitch in  the store and i think he  has two words and he just  goes ah fuck all of you  just walked off stage  wow  and he just came up he  was supposed to do about  forty five minutes 
[01:30:30]  the first two minutes he's  like i hate this crowd  fuck all of you and he  left  you know classic  he went upstairs and  ordered food  classic  you know i've read a lot  of twitter comments in the  last few days and uh the  ones that stand out i mean  obviously most people  especially associated with  our show loved patrice on  our show  but it came through here  and there people that  absolutely fucking hated  patrice but what they  said on twitter was i  fucking hated the guy  but i'm crying my eyes  out and i always i found 
[01:31:00]  that very interesting that  was the type of guy he  was man  you know  he evoked a reaction  yes he did  yeah  but i mean usually  usually if an enemy of  yours dies you're not  fucking crying  you know  it's just so funny also  people just kind of give  you know  they knew i was his  friend and they'd give  condolences and they'd go  this is a tragedy he was  such a nice man and even  in my show they should go  i don't know if i  described it as nice  i don't know if nice is  the word i go with he was  a great guy  patrice 
[01:31:30]  patrice was patrice was  absolutely a nice guy  i know for some reason  and really just like you  know i spent  uh norin will tell you like  we spent many holiday  together at his house and  yeah  and just always welcome  people in just i mean  didn't have to again you  know i was a comic who  came up when he was  already in the city doing  his thing and really took  it took an interest and  i'll never forget him for  that man he'll he'll he'll  always live on you guys  have so much material on  him and you guys are  sharing with everybody man  i appreciate it let me 
[01:32:00]  talk about it well we  burned all the material  yesterday oh shit it was  it was a cleansing for us  yes we felt that we  shouldn't be played  anymore the language was  offensive yeah we burned  it in a big barrel yes and  we were drinking from some  fucking you know whatever  we don't like the ladies to  be offended yeah that's  we're trying to become  more lady friendly to get  some advertisers we're  trying to move on  no more of that potty  now you're gonna become  you're gonna end up on  the uh the fucking oprah  channel yeah he uh when  he let his guard down man  fuck it was it was really  warm just the vulnerability 
[01:32:30]  and it's uh and it's an  amazing storyteller and just  pontificator on life and  just so it was fun to watch  the evolution from  patrice being like uh you  know to a guy who just  lived very surface happy  and you know pepsi cola  rapist and i'm a fat kid  trying to uh get chicks  when he was younger and  stuff to you know to where  he became ultimately like  you know conspiracy theorist  just like you know philosopher  in his own way brilliant  mind and and in all the 
[01:33:00]  sadness at least what will  come of it is like you know  he's going to be a legend  without a doubt oh yeah and  he should you know it's it's  it's weird it's like i've  been thinking about him a lot  and you know prior i still  really think is the greatest  comic in carlin but when  you look at patrice like  first of all he had 20 less  years than even prior and  and 30 less years in carlin  and when you as a person as  a human being all of those  greats patrice could sit in  the room with any of those  guys and and hold his own 
[01:33:30]  talking and back batting back  and forth comedically like  he's as funny as anybody that  has ever performed i mean he  wasn't as evolved as prior  obviously but he i think he  could have gotten there and  i really believe that i'm not  just saying that because he's  dead he was really that great  you said yesterday that he  could hold his own with any  any person any comic living or  dead any comic living or dead  he could be as funny as in the  radio in the room absolutely  anyway it was a funny comic he  was a funny human being yeah 
[01:34:00]  and people get you know jay  people get confused by that  over the years we have uh run  into a bunch of guys that are  hilarious on a stage but then  you get them in here or just in  a room in general and they're  not funny people  it's really  very often  huh  it's a thinly veiled excuse for  why you don't have me in very  often  you've just fallen through the  you've just fallen through the  big cracks i i don't know  we'll get you on more jay but  seriously people don't realize  that you know they assume if a 
[01:34:30]  guy's funny on stage he's a  funny human being it's not true  no man some people know how to  write funny but they're not just  like you know they're not the  day-to-day  his mind always worked funny it  was never it never worked in the  tragic it was always like how  can it how can you bring levity to  it even if it seems like it's  being like very sinister  he just knew how to like uh how to  go for it i'll tell you i've been  really moved by going through uh  through jimmy's twitter and  seeing uh how many pictures can  it look like uh jim is a happy uh  bitch in a prison race 
[01:35:00]  it's funny jimmy smiling ear to  ear yeah just creeped out by the  little fucking the white lump he  had to stand next to but it was  funny that picture i posted of all  of us in the stress factor i think  that was the benefit of masavia's  son when he was sitting or you're  sitting on his lap and uh i'm  wearing my sabra-cadabra  sweatshirt and patrice is there and  our heads are just back into the  left this is a weird photo  rather than report the rape we  just turned our heads left yeah  yeah yeah you both you both both 
[01:35:30]  have the heads turn the same way  it's really weird what was  happening that we were doing  that with our heads why  maybe one of us farted or  something i don't know it really  was like uh it was like an 80s  movie where you guys did a  double take back yeah he was  funny all the time the one  frustrating thing working with  him was we would go to break and  he would just continue he always  continue yeah and i can't tell  you i would say it a hundred  fucking times save it for the  save it for the air save it for  the air you know i didn't want to  lose that moment yeah he was  just conversing and he was so 
[01:36:00]  confident he's like he would look  at me like i got more of this  yeah i'm not even gonna talk  about this on the air because i got  10 other things that are just as  funny yeah we should have the  mics going off air yeah  what's interesting is too is like  uh how ingrained in like uh white  culture and white friends patrice  was he still had that black thing  where he didn't think joking around  gay was that funny and uh the last  time i was in the studio with you  guys was when uh was it bobo came  in and norton talked him into a  boner oh yeah yeah it was the only 
[01:36:30]  time i've ever seen patrice she was  utterly speechless yeah yeah that was  uh huge nervously nervously glaring  over at this uh half retarded guy's  boner but he fucking howled that's one  of the biggest laughs um if you watch  him he howled at that he couldn't  believe that bobo's cock was reacting  were you in that day yeah oh you were  okay okay with pat from bunaki all  right yeah no wow you that's uh that's  a moment yeah that was huge have you  seen the video online huh have you 
[01:37:00]  watched it online no they have a post  up online yeah that's up there just  just search out patrice oh uh bobo up  and down game it's hard to watch it makes  me very sad to watch it but it's his big  his big laugh and you remember how he  just watching him shake right before he  laughs and and lose control was uh is my  favorite part of that video yeah i gotta ask  jimmy some do you think do you think he  knew that he wasn't gonna live to old  age in general i don't i don't know did  he have that feel about him i don't  know i mean i i think that like patrice 
[01:37:30]  looked at death like kind of like i'm  guessing because he's diabetic and he  didn't take as good a care of himself  it becomes an intangible thing that's  why people like we know it exists but  we don't always address it like you  know that's why drinkers drink and  drug addicts because you know it's  there but yeah yeah yeah right um i  think that we'll say things like yeah  i'm not gonna live forever right but i  don't think he saw it coming this early  no no i don't know no i think  absolutely not but i'll tell you what  there's such interesting uh you know if  you go back you'll find a five thousand 
[01:38:00]  things like this but uh on the roast the  charlie sheen roast i rewatched that the  other day and uh one of the bumpers when  he was coming up next like before went to  commercial you know it says and patrice  o'neill and it shows patrice is the only  words he says he goes this may be my last  show oh very weird very weird that's  what he did that's it that's all he  is  wow very uh i know it's not what he  meant obviously but it's just like uh  yeah you'll find you'll find a thousand  things like that where it's like yeah  yeah yeah and now look in the room he  says uh you know he goes i'm 40 years 
[01:38:30]  old but uh he goes with all everything  because i got everything that kills uh  that kills black people in the 77 and  nigger years yeah 77 yeah he's hilarious  god damn i'm gonna miss him thank you so  much man for letting me call in no all  right jay take care brother good job jay  thanks man where where you you're gonna  be in dc this weekend you said yeah  where i'm at the dc improv improv okay  good all right jay we'll have you in

Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall. 
[01:43:00]  It's too late now because here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  This is pretty cool.  What is this, E-Rod?  This is Jason Ellis' new song.  What? 
[01:43:30]  Cool.  Toto Moto Botaski.  What does that mean?  Turn it up.  And get Jason.  I feel the hell that I'm feeling damn.  Gotta get on the water.  Get out of town.  She got 300 horses.  You can't catch me.  I'm speeding.  There's a secret cook hall, but I keep on my waiting.  Feel the wind on my balls.  Cause they're always a season.  This baby's got mirrors.  They're there for no reason.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:44:00]  I just want to ride my jet ski.  Ladies.  Take me out of my naked.  Nobody I know plays hockey.  Rocks are punched in chains.  He's rocking.  Don't, don't, don't, don't stop it.  I'm laughing at the name of the album.  Jason Ellis in studio.  I like that, man.  Yeah, it's about jet skiing naked.  It's like yoga for, I just figured out, I was really obsessed with, I want to get out 
[01:44:30]  in the water, but I don't want sharks to eat me.  Yeah.  So I was trying to surf.  I finally got over sharks eating me.  And then when I would surf, all these fucking assholes get all angry at you for surfing.  And I came to surf to, to get away from the stress of, you know what I mean, working  for the man and shit.  Yeah.  So I'm like, look, I don't want to fucking fight dudes in the ocean.  I was trying to like become one with nature.  And I'm like, how do I get away from these fuckheads and still be in the water? 
[01:45:00]  And I'm obsessed with being naked.  You can't be naked in public.  You go to fucking jail and shit.  I got kids.  So I, uh, I figured out I want to get a jet ski.  I'm sponsored by Kawasaki.  And then I got the standup jet ski and a standup jet ski is, it's a difficult fucking  thing to ride.  Yeah.  So there goes the relaxing thing again.  You're now doing the same shit that I always do.  Fight, jump, shit, fucking skate, idiot.  Right.  I'm like, I just want to fucking relax, man.  And then I figured it.  Sit down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's personal watercraft. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  But in my world, the action sports, uh, fags, they think that that's gay to have a sit  down one.  I'm like, you guys don't have a fucking job.  You ride toys for a living.  I remember that.  You don't need to relax.  Your life is a vacation.  So then I got this fucking jets, this it's supercharged and it's 300 horsepower.  Oh man.  No way.  It does 70 mile an hour.  Oh, so nice.  Yeah.  So I go out on that thing and then I get out far enough to just take all my clothes off  and just fucking rip into it. 
[01:46:00]  And it's very therapeutic.  And then I like to lie there and there's always, every time I park it out in the middle of  the ocean naked, seals come over.  They're not gay seals.  They come over and hang out.  And I like to, cause I like to talk to animals and shit cause I, you know, got fucking problems.  And, uh, they float next to me and I just, you know, I mean I look at the sky and say,  fuck yeah, man, you made it.  You got yourself a fucking, uh, 300 horsepower fucking shit boat and your dick's out.  Here's what I'd be afraid of, uh, by the way, I, I, I used to have a, uh, see-do and  zip around. 
[01:46:30]  It's a fucking blast.  I love it.  But I'd wear kind of a, a wetsuit bottom and it kind of holds your balls up a little bit  because when you're bouncing on that seat, the idea of having your nuts fucking down there  where you could smash down on them is frightening.  It is, it is, uh, 70 mile an hour.  It is dangerous.  Yeah.  If there's like a random wave, things can get hectic.  And if you're flying off the thing and you land dick first, you could rip your dick right  off.  It would.  But I've never done that.  I don't turn when I'm naked.  No.  No, no, no.  You don't turn when it's a straight line. 
[01:47:00]  Not even a fucking, not one angle at all.  Yeah, fucking dead shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The balls sort of swing back and.  Cause man, if you're turning on that thing, you do a nice tight turn, you hit a wave wrong,  boy, do you fly.  Yeah, I've done that.  I've done that.  You can put so far away from the thing too, you fly.  You can step your legs off on those things.  Yeah, it's crazy.  What do you do?  Love it.  I was just laughing cause I don't want Jason to think I was laughing at a song.  I'm laughing at the new, the CD called Death, Death, Die.  That's my new band.  That rules.  Shirley did some standup at the, we did a gig last night and he did some standup before 
[01:47:30]  we went on and he said that, uh, you know, cause Jason went to rehab and Jason doesn't  drink, he doesn't have sex, he doesn't fucking smoke weed anymore.  He just changed his band to Fag, Fag, Fag.  And I was like, I'm really, I've really contemplated doing that cause that, that thigh is pretty  sweet.  But Fag, Fag, Fag is like, you know, it's writing, it's in your face.  Figure it sums it up a little bit.  It really does round me up.  What happened to you, man?  Out of nowhere, we all learned that you went into rehab.  Yeah.  Well, I, you know, walk us through that a little bit.  Okay.  Uh, I tried it fast. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, you know, my dad.  Well, you were sober for how long?  I'm sorry, but how long were you sober?  Completely sober, three years.  And then I started, my little brother died.  I started smoking weed a little bit.  When I went back to Australia, I smoked some weed with my friends and my old friends.  And I was like, that was like helping me cope, which was, it was the first mistake.  And then I just, uh, that was, uh, four years ago.  Oh, okay.  So then just a little bit, but not much.  And then I had a producer that Sirius had just decided to be good for the show. 
[01:48:30]  And he was a nice guy, but he was a fucking old idiot.  And every time he spoke, it was like fucking chalkboard shit.  And I couldn't deal with it.  And I just wanted to go on the radio and go, cunt, fuck, fuck, cunt, fuck, die.  Fucking hate.  I hate.  So I was like, wait, wait, wait.  Before the show.  All right.  I want to slow you down though.  The stupid suits thinking, oh, we need to control the show a little bit with Jason.  It wasn't there.  Give him someone that kind of knows the business.  Yeah.  He was going to teach me the game.  And I was like, I don't, I don't need the game. 
[01:49:00]  That's what I'm good at is accidental bullshit.  I love asking you this stuff because we went through all that same shit.  It's like, just let us do our dumb show.  They would try to give us producers and people that would watch over us.  I'll tell you what, man.  Things have changed.  Good.  I'm not, I am not here to bitch anymore about Sirius XM.  Those guys, for once, like, though, I went to.  They stepped up?  Fuck yeah.  They listened.  They're like, whatever you want to do.  And I'm like, I don't like that.  Okay, Mr. Ellis.  I'm like, wow.  Fuck.  Thank you.  But we are talking about the old times when they gave you that guy.  So that guy made you smoke a little more weed. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, and then it escalated.  And then I thought that I was being successful, responsible, making some good money.  And why can't I have a beer every now and then?  And then as soon as that happened, maybe that took, I think it was about a year.  It was actually after I was here, did the Stern show and then your show.  And I was number one on Google search.  And my manager's all pumped.  And I'm like, you know what, man?  Fuck, I'm going to go to the bar and have a beer.  What the fuck?  Celebrate a little bit.  Yeah, I had a beer and I watched a soccer game.  One beer.  I was like, there you go.  You're good.  And then every now and then on a plane. 
[01:50:00]  And then every now and then at the fucking truck races.  And then every now and then I got paid to do club appearances.  The death of me.  Yeah, those are the tough ones, huh?  Yeah.  And then...  Because they expect you to drink and be out of your mind, right?  At those club appearances.  Well, you're up to...  It's like they say show up at 12 and stay till 2.  That is not a time for a guy like me to be awake.  I've got two kids.  That's a weird thing for me to do.  Right.  So, then, you know, I've always been somebody that wants to have sex with a lot of people. 
[01:50:30]  Jim, you know, I've had sex with Chyna.  Why would you do that?  She's not that attractive.  She's kind of a man.  Yeah.  I like a big clip.  You said that.  Jimmy kind of had a little thing for her.  As soon as I said that.  Oh, you did talk.  Yeah.  You were like, hey, hey, I'd fuck her.  And I was like, okay, cool.  But, you know, I've always sort of fought to not fuck everybody because I want to badly.  And it got to the point where there's porn stars and shit that were texting me.  And I'm like, it's going to fucking happen.  You know what I mean?  And if I fuck somebody and my wife finds out, I don't have any family over here. 
[01:51:00]  I love my in-laws.  I really love them.  It's not like an opposite thing that everyone else talks about when they're married.  I love them.  And if I fucking cheat on my wife, that's their daughter.  And they're not going to like me.  And my wife's not going to like me.  I've got two kids.  It's just not worth it.  So in therapy, I just said that I think we should split because I'm having urges of stuff  that I think I'm not going to be able to stop sooner or later.  And I don't want to hurt you anymore because I did it back in the day.  I did it. 
[01:51:30]  I slept with a whale.  And she found out.  And it was just like, not only am I cocksucking cheap, but I'm disgusting as well.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with fat people.  There's a lot wrong with them.  What made you go, like, say that to her instead of saying, like, I'm going to do something  for the sex addiction?  I didn't know I had sex addiction.  I didn't believe that there was a sex addiction.  I just was like, I'm a dude.  I'm a dude that can't.  I'm 40 years old.  I cannot stop.  Know who you are and fucking let her live a life with it and find a normal person that 
[01:52:00]  she can trust.  She deserves that.  What's the difference between being a dude and being addicted to sex?  Well, I'll tell you.  Because I know.  I have to do the, my life coach went on the internet and said, I answered this survey  and I answered it and he's like, it says here you're a sex addict.  It's a thing where you don't want to have sex with people that you have sex with.  Like, I like hot chicks.  But if you're a fucking bush pig and you corner me, you can blow me.  And then as soon as I come, I'm like, oh my God, you're so disgusting. 
[01:52:30]  And then because I say I'm disgusting, I hate myself and I want more people to blow  me that I don't like.  So it just kept going and then it escalated to, you know what I mean, the hard rock.  I left my wife, man.  I don't, you know, I never loved anybody more than that person.  So it didn't make any sense that I would do that.  How long after you left her, did you hook up with somebody?  Like two days.  Did you already know the person who you were going to hook up with? 
[01:53:00]  No, no.  It was just, it's just all the people that I was like, no, I don't want to, but I  really do, you know, I would say stupid things like I really do leading them on.  You know, I can't, but I fucking would if I could.  Sure.  Like, just don't say that.  Instead of just going, no, thank you.  I couldn't say no.  Because you don't want to cut them off.  It was fucking two people.  The guy that has the A tattoo on his face would say no.  And then the other guy would go, but I would if I could.  And there was no one around.  Well, I'm, I'm, I'm a little confused because, uh, the little I know about you, you said you're,  you were, you know, really in love with your wife, right?  And now you knew you were going to do this, so you would rather leave her than do it. 
[01:53:30]  But why wouldn't you at that point sit down with her and try to work it out?  We'd been, we'd been going through this for, I've been trying, I've been wanting to have  sex with other people for the last two years.  Right.  Wow.  And I was, and I, and you just realized, I was just like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it.  You know, there was already text messages and shit.  I don't really want to get into it.  But if you, if you, that you, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, intriguing.  Yeah.  I'm doing shit that if she saw it, it's cheating.  I mean, I didn't, it didn't go in the hole, but fuck dude, it mentally did. 
[01:54:00]  And it starts slowly too.  It starts with like, uh, yelling, Hey, if I wouldn't get caught, like, uh, yeah, that's  really, wow.  You do have a good ass LOL.  It's something kind of innocent.  Oh, thank you.  Jim's on it right there.  But it absolutely builds slowly.  And you convince yourself, like you'll actually, there's times where you'll write LOL in a sexual  thing and actually go, like, you'll actually laugh just so you're not lying.  But it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's complete self-deception, complete self-deception.  And, uh, it's all leading up to inevitably doing it. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  So then that whole thing happened.  And I, you know, and then I was at the hard rock, I got this massive room, the hard rock  gave me this thing with a fucking elevator in it.  And I'm hanging out with chicks that I don't know.  I haven't even talked to them.  I'm sort of, I blacked out at the party and I woke up and there was a girl there that was  fucking, it, she was kind of hot, but not.  I don't, I don't want anybody in my room.  It's over.  And then she, I brush my teeth and she's doing some bumps out of a fucking dime bag.  And I'm like, what's that?  She's like, that's morphine. 
[01:55:00]  You know, I got the stomach, my, my uterus hurts or something.  And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, oh, that's not more, you mean it's heroin.  She's like, well, whatever, you know, whatever.  Yeah.  And I'm like, I can't, I don't, I don't sit in, I don't do heroin with people.  I'm, I get to, I'm, I'm past that.  And now I'm like, here we go again from back in the day when I was a kid where I did heroin.  I let hookers shoot me up with heroin.  I'm like, you fucking go there again now after, I fucked my skateboard career at the very end.  I could have stayed.  Now I've got this chance to do radio that I'd like for a guy to love something that much, 
[01:55:30]  be good at it and then fucking fall out of it and find something else that he loves even  more and is even better at, that's bullshit luck.  Yeah.  Don't fuck it off.  So I called therapists and then I called, uh, psycho Mike who does, he's a co-host with  Dr. Drew.  Dr. Drew called me and then we did this whole, you know, ask questions, blah, blah, blah.  And he's like, you're a fucking sex addict.  You need to go to rehab.  And I knew that weed thing was too much and I can't drink. 
[01:56:00]  It's ridiculous.  So I, I was like, fuck it, let's go.  And I went in there and did all this therapy and found out, because I thought they were  going to say your dad died, your brother died.  You, you, you're trying to fucking medicate yourself.  Right.  And then I knew I was molested when I was a kid, but I didn't know.  I just thought it was the neighbor.  Cause that's what my mom told me.  Did you remember it or did you just like say the affection?  It became obvious.  I didn't remember until I was 17 when I, I, after a demo, I took acid and a bunch of crystal  meth and I had an imaginary friend and I was in a pool in the top of a hotel talking to him.  My girlfriend was just standing there watching me cause she thought I might drown myself. 
[01:56:30]  And I said to my imaginary friend that I was molested by my father.  She called my mom.  My mom said, fuck, I didn't think he would remember that.  It wasn't his father.  It was the neighbor.  And then I dive into it in therapy and the neighbor, they, you know, my father and my  mother, mother went over to his apartment or something and said, how could you?  And he said, it wasn't me.  My father is dead now.  My father, I've never seen anybody with a worse temper than my father.  I've seen my father knock people's teeth out for cutting him off on the freeway.  It's, you fucked me and you didn't, cause I'm a dad. 
[01:57:00]  You fucked my kid.  I don't give a fuck.  I'll kill you.  End of story.  I don't give a fuck.  You're dead.  Right.  And that my dad was way less rational than me.  So then when I came out and I stayed back in my house, like two days later, I came out  of his house and he's there in the kitchen.  He's like, do you think you got molested?  And I was like, yeah.  Do you think it was me?  I was like, no, no, I don't.  And then I walked off, went to the ramp skating, never brought it up ever again.  Did you think it was odd he asked you that?  Like, like, do you think it was me? 
[01:57:30]  Not at the time.  No.  Cause I just didn't want, I didn't, I couldn't believe that it had happened.  Cause once I found that out, then I started to like, I could see shit, couldn't see a  face, but I could see a dick.  And then I knew the game, like the game was like, you know, you do it for this long and  I'll do it for that long sort of thing.  Like I got played into that.  It was like, you suck me and I'll suck.  It's funny.  I did that when I was a kid with other kids.  Right.  Well then that made, you know what I mean?  Cause then, you know, the therapy of that, cause it felt good.  So now if it felt good, then it's my fault.  And then me acting out and wanting people, cause all I wanted chicks to do is blow me 
[01:58:00]  and take control.  I don't want to be in charge of anything, which is what he was doing.  So then, you know, I mean, all this therapy is like my father did this and that's why  that I am the way I am.  And I told my wife to leave and now it's gone.  It's over.  Like I don't have my wife.  My wife's moved on.  And then my therapist, it's not your fault.  I'm like, I seen that movie.  Don't fucking do that to me.  You know, okay, it's not my fault, but I don't, I live in an apartment by myself and I don't 
[01:58:30]  want to, you know what I mean?  I don't, I don't want to, I make good money and I live in some fucking shit apartment in  Santa Monica and she lives in Beverly Hills with my kids and sees other dudes.  And how long have you been supposed to be?  Like three months.  Well, it's not that long.  I mean, people take breaks sometimes, you know?  Yeah, but I, I fucked people.  And then there's all my fans that, that would be like, oh, this is drunk at the hard rock  and he's got some fucking tattoo bitch.  And then some chick, cause I told her when I went to rehab, I call, I had like, you know,  I don't want to get into how many, I had a lot of girls and I told them all, like I'm, 
[01:59:00]  I'm a sex addict, alcoholic and addicted to marijuana.  I'm going to rehab.  I just want you to know I can't see you and I appreciate if you didn't contact.  me and, you know, I don't want to be mean.  And some of them were like, cool.  And some of them were like, fuck you.  Oh shit.  Uh, here's a photo of your dick on Twitter.  You know what I mean?  Like, and then some of my chicks sees that and I don't care cause my dick's on fucking  Howard TV and I don't know, but my dick's everywhere.  Fucking clamps, gay dudes, fucking cupping my balls. 
[01:59:30]  I don't give a fuck.  You know what I mean?  And I'm, I'm packing.  So who gives a shit?  But I, I, I, the only person I didn't want to see that was her.  And there's just more stabs, more stabs to the point where she's like, I'm moving on.  And then she did and she has, and she's happy and I, and I'm happy for her, but that's the  only thing.  Do you have a goal where you want to be like, like, cause it seems like, like that, that's  kind of a spinning out of control thing.  Well, I'm in fucking therapy all day to be, I want to be, I want to be, I want to get 
[02:00:00]  past this whole sex addiction thing so that I'm allowed to see other people.  I'm not allowed to see anybody.  And I want to be, I want to, I don't, I want to, now that I know what happened, it's far,  it's far more easy for me to be a hundred percent happy.  Right.  Cause I just didn't know why I wasn't a hundred percent happy.  I'm like, I got everything, but I'm like 20% depressed all day.  And I would smoke weed to, to fill that void.  So now that I've got that, I just want to see therapy.  I just want to do it.  Stay in therapy, stay straight, work on myself. 
[02:00:30]  Cause the only thing I don't like, like I forgive my dad.  I forgive everybody.  I don't forgive my dick yet.  I just don't cause I mean, okay, it's not my fault.  Dude, I was there.  I know what I did.  How old were you?  When?  What?  What was happening?  It was three months.  No, no, no.  When you were a kid, how old were you?  Four to five.  They said four to five.  And then, cause I have a other, I remember being underneath my bed, holding the underneath  of my bed with my hands and my toes, staying off the ground to hide.  And he would come in with a torch and I don't like all these things.  Cause I had like some hypnosis and shit.  That's a flashlight to your Americans. 
[02:01:00]  Thank you.  Cause it is a flashlight.  Yeah.  So all this shit.  Cause a torch is a torch.  Yeah.  No, no.  He didn't burn me.  He didn't burn me.  But it's weird.  Cause he's my idol.  You know, he was, and he was a good, he loved me, but he was fucking crazy.  And that made me crazy.  Gave me a fucking sweet job.  I mean, I mean, there's a,  there's a part of me that the crazy bit that people are entertained by.  Like, you know, if I'm scared of snakes, I get a nine foot anaconda to come in the next  day and bite me.  That's not normal.  But fuck, if you're listening to my show, that was pretty entertaining.  So, you know, I take the good with the bad. 
[02:01:30]  Are you afraid that if you get healthy, quote unquote, or stop doing certain things, you're  going to lose the performance side of like Jason Ellis or like the part that makes you  interesting is going to be gone.  No, I actually believe that that shit is overrated.  I really thought less of myself and thought that if I didn't do that, that nobody would listen  to me, but I'm actually more, uh, I'm more positive now that what I say is far more entertaining  than like, Hey, watch me bleed.  You know, this is, this is, this is amazing to listen to you.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I'm actually excited. 
[02:02:00]  How long ago?  I'm just a little bit depressed because of that one thing that I, if I hadn't done this  a year ago, I'd be, you know, how long ago was rehab?  You just get out a month ago.  And how are you doing?  I don't need it at all.  Really?  I don't need the, the, the drugs or the, the blowjobs at all.  I don't.  Are you doing anything besides just like, uh, keeping it vague?  Are you, are you doing any 12 step stuff?  I go to, I go to meetings when I'm around, but it's not, I'm not even, it's not even  really like I'm an alcoholic. 
[02:02:30]  You know, I go to meetings just to be safe.  It's the sex addiction thing that is, cause I can get it.  I feel like it's not a problem.  It's hard for me to get around that.  So my therapist said I can jack off now.  So that's cool.  Well, that's the, that's the issue though is like, okay, if you're an alcoholic and you're  in recovery, you know, you can't have anything to drink.  Sex addiction.  Now you've got to have sex sooner or later.  It's like somebody with a food addiction.  They have to eat to survive.  So it's, it's hard, uh, to continue with it.  But you gotta know, like you have to know you're an alcoholic.  Like you completely know it. 
[02:03:00]  And it, it, it, to me, that's the one that's cause you're in a blackout and do stuff.  There's no way sex addiction will stay away if you blackout.  Exactly.  Oh no.  A couple of drinks and all, and all of a sudden I'd be like, what's a blowjob?  Come on.  That's what's the big deal.  But it is, I, the only, that's a tough thing.  Cause I, there's, I don't have any, I can't buy any weed.  I can't buy any booze.  I can't have, even a bimbo, like a companion, like let's go to lunch with a bimbo.  I can't do that.  So it's a lot of.  So what are you doing?  Just skiing, obviously.  No, I, well, I, no, I'm fucking, I'm in New York and I'm, my band and, and, uh, you know, 
[02:03:30]  fighting and, and, and my kids.  And I, it's not actually that difficult.  Where are you at with your kids?  Cause I know how much you love them.  Well, my, my wife is, we're still friends.  We're still good friends.  So I go, I live down the road.  I come and see him every night and, and I have him on the weekends.  It's actually spend more time with him, but it's, it's, I just need to focus on being really  happy, you know, practicing training.  Like I train to fight, train to skate on being happy, loving myself so that I can fall in 
[02:04:00]  love with somebody else in the future and be happy for my, and take care of my kids.  What about the X?  What's that?  What about the X?  That's definitely done, done.  I don't know.  I mean, I would take her back in a second, but I have, I can't think like that.  Cause I'm one of those people that is like, you know, I keep bashing myself.  She's happy and seeing other people.  I don't need to fucking live in that, in that world.  I need to just work on myself.  And I imagine it's humiliating to have your husband publicly on Twitter being called out. 
[02:04:30]  So maybe the, maybe the satisfaction is, uh, Hey, look, I'm doing this too.  I'm not trapped in a humiliating situation.  Maybe it's not the other guys as much as it is just not being humiliated.  I don't think she's in love with anybody else or anything, but I think, you know,  I'm just happy.  She's happy.  But there's that, you know, I'm in therapy, man.  You know, like I have that 20% of the, I wake up sometimes and I go, ah, and then there's  a wave of emotion that hits me.  And then I go fucking suck it up.  Shit head.  You've got two TV shows.  Your kids are fucking awesome.  Don't do it to yourself.  But you know, I'm only human. 
[02:05:00]  I, you know, there's probably 20% of the day where I do do that.  You know, I just think about it and what's the tattoo by the way.  It's Andrea.  It's a shit.  Oh, okay.  Right on his, right on his, uh, it's so obvious to me now that the fight that I've put on,  I mean, I put that on like, you know what I mean?  Will power.  Like you love your wife, put the fucking thing on your face.  Cause then chicks can't fuck you.  What is that?  That's my wife's initial shit.  You know, my whole back is covered in a family of elephants with determination across  it. 
[02:05:30]  Cause I'm determined to keep my family together.  Like I was just trying so hard to not do what I wanted to do.  Damn, man.  So you go to therapy often?  Yeah.  You talk to other sober people or just the therapist?  Uh, well, I have a, I have a sex therapist and I have like a life coach.  I talk to life coach like four or five times a day and my therapist two times a week.  I can't afford it anymore.  Four or five times a day?  Mm-hmm.  But no sober people who are just not charging you?  Uh, I've got, I don't have a sponsor yet cause I got out of rehab and came to New York, 
[02:06:00]  but I call, I've got a couple of people that I'm, I knew in rehab that I talked to every  now and then, but I'm not, you know, I call those people if I need, if I think I'm going  to use this.  I did a gig last night.  I told my bank, can you, you know, can you keep drunk people off me and chicks off me?  Cause my therapist said, you know, be a whole club.  So I mean, we played the, my new show on fuel TV aired last night.  So I'm sitting in the, in the club standing there trying to watch a show and it's just 
[02:06:30]  drunk people.  And a couple of people came up and the weed thing came off their face into my face.  And I was like, where the fuck is my band?  Why aren't they?  I want to watch the show.  And then I was cornered by a couple of chicks and they want to do this and they want to  do that.  And they think they're hot.  And I was like, thank you.  God, you're in hell, man.  It's wasn't that, it's not that bad.  It's really not that bad.  I mean, it's the story, I know I'm on the radio, you want to hear the story.  There's the story, but I'm not of turmoil, but it's all around it.  You don't, I'm like, my other TV show got picked up the other day.  Me, Bam and Tony, I've been trying to work on that one was three years in the making. 
[02:07:00]  And now I've got that.  What's that show about?  It's about me, Bam, Margera and Tony Hawk.  All three of us are skateboarders that work in the radio world.  So that's where it bases off and then it splits off into, you know, all the stunts and  the shit that we do and Tony's traveling.  It's like a reality show.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  But Jeff Tremaine is the producer, the guy that does Jackass and Nitro Circus and all  that shit.  So it's all I ever wanted is this one thing to, because I just want to get out there and 
[02:07:30]  get bigger so that I can come back here and make Scott Greenstein bleed.  Good luck with that.  It's everybody's goal, isn't it?  Good luck with that.  He's a fucking robot.  I believe I can get to him.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  You guys have been there.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like that.  But what I really want to do is pump this fucking album because this single shit, rock and  roll shit, I don't know if you guys know this, the number one rock and roll single is fucking 
[02:08:00]  Nickelback and Daltry, and I'm like, America, do you know how fucking gay you are?  Like, who's the biggest guy on radio?  Ryan Seacrest.  Yeah.  Like, fag off, you fucking pussies.  Like, America, Canada, you're all fucking gay.  Like, fight the fight, you shitheads.  I don't get it.  I mean, there's nowhere to play this stuff except for satellite.  Well, I made one song on the album that has no profanity at all. 
[02:08:30]  It's called The Pain of Time, and it's a song where the fans actually wrote the lyrics  about falling in love and being gay and breaking the chain.  It's just all bullshit.  It just actually doesn't make any sense.  The whole song is just about being gay.  Right.  With no cussing in it, so I figured if it was really gay that all you pussies would get  it as number one on iTunes because I just want to be number one on iTunes.  Good strategy.  I like that you got an unplugged version of You Could Go Fuck Yourself.  That seems very nice.  Right.  The other band, when I had the other band, Taint Stick, we had a song called Fuck Your 
[02:09:00]  Face, and we had a G-rated version of Fuck Your Face, and there's like four words in  it.  It's three minutes, and you can't hear any lyrics at all.  The album's called Ninja Flying Eagles, right?  Yes.  It's a 25th anniversary.  And the band's called Death, Death, Die.  Yeah, go, Jay.  It's a 25th anniversary edition because it's been that long.  Wow.  We're very, very funny, Jim.  Yeah.  Fucking idiots. 
[02:09:30]  How's the...  Are you back on the radio live?  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  On Faction.  Yeah, I don't...  Yeah, I'm not hiding anything.  I would have done radio in rehab.  That's how I roll.  Everything...  Everybody has to know everything about my life.  That's...  I think that's how I got here, and that's how I'm going to stay.  So, you know...  It's very, very exciting.  Yeah.  I'm always comfortable giving out information, too.  Giving out information is very easy.  Yeah.  Like, even painful, despicable information.  The harder part is when I'm doing something to convince myself that I'm doing it. 
[02:10:00]  Like, when I'm doing stuff that I know is going to take me to a bad place, I still allow  myself to do it, even though I give out the information.  Even though you know.  Yeah.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a little bit of joy in every bit of pain that I have.  Because I'm like, well, fucking, that's going to be an hour of glorious radio.  You know?  Your mom's still alive, too, right?  Yeah.  That was the other funny thing.  In rehab, I had to call my mom and my stepmom about the whole thing, and, oh, come to think  of it.  And I'm like, oh, my God, come to think of it. 
[02:10:30]  Do you realize how offensive the sentence, come to think of it, is to me?  But, you know, higher power, I forgive you.  Fuck.  That just sounds rough, man.  I don't know.  It just sounds like so much work.  You guys know how it is.  Fuck.  Come on.  You guys just lost a fucking close friend.  You got to, like, what are you going to do?  Just give up?  What would he want you to do, you know?  Give up.  Give up.  Because he was really pompous. 
[02:11:00]  And that pompous motherfucker wouldn't want anybody continuing without him.  That motherfucker wanted the earth to stop spinning.  He wants a mass suicide.  If there was a button he could have pushed with his finger as he died to kill us, he  would have pushed it in his second hand.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Well, then, keep rolling the depressed game, then.  He was an amazing talent.  Yeah.  He was an amazing talent.  Did you know him?  Yeah.  No, I've been in here.  I listen to you guys all the time.  You know, he was in here.  I met him.  I don't know him.  You were in once with him?  Yeah.  And I listen to your show all the time.  I know he's a funny guy. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, 41 and a heart thing.  Because, you know, I was diagnosed with heart disease when I was, like, 38.  And, you know, I went to hospital and I was in there on the bed and they're fucking  putting these things on me.  And I'm like, oh, God, I don't even know you.  But please, please don't let me die right now.  Oh, shit.  And then three months later, all this heart test and shit, I don't have fucking heart  disease.  You know, I panic myself into freaking people out.  So, yeah, but I know, you know, man, it's cold.  It's not cool. 
[02:12:00]  You know, I've lost my brother.  He's 24.  I know how you guys feel.  I know it's real reasons.  I know.  I know it's different, but I get it.  It's the same thing, though.  I mean, it's not right.  41 is not right.  Yeah.  He's a fucking dude.  He's not an old man.  Yeah.  Old men die.  Yeah.  I keep seeing that number 41.  I'm like, fuck.  How old are you?  48.  48?  You're 48?  I'm just kidding.  You look really good for 48. 
[02:12:30]  Do you not listen to corporate at all?  Huh?  Sorry, just being an asshole.  Corporate?  I love them.  They're very, very nice to me.  Are they?  Well, you know, I could.  Well, you just re-signed with them, right?  Yeah, for one year, which is awesome.  Because in another year from now, God, my dick is just going to be huge, Jimmy.  Huge.  I would hope so.  Smack it around everywhere in here.  Just go in there with fucking your dick out.  I really am going to put it on the table.  You're like, my dick says one million.  Here you go. 
[02:13:00]  I actually walk into the negotiations with ice in my underpants and just say, please  don't fire me.  Every time I actually get asked to go into one of the glass domes, I say that.  I'm like, am I fired?  Am I fired?  Am I going to hate this?  Am I okay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fine.  All right, good.  Proceed.  But I've never had better meetings in the glass house in my entire life.  Everyone very happy, very nice.  Oh, good.  Nice.  So, yeah, I'm very, very happy to be working here.  Love it.  My race number is 41 now in my truck, because I changed my race number, because I got fucking 
[02:13:30]  89 on my dad's race number, so I had to change it.  Oh, yeah.  So I'm representing my channel, hardcore, racing, fucking, I'm going to get the tattoo,  we're going all the way to the fucking top.  God.  It's going to be glorious.  How do you find the time to do all this?  Because I'm a mother.  A father, radio guy, TV star, in a band.  It just motivates you, dude.  It's one way or the other for me.  I was like, man, my brother died, and then I got heart disease, and I didn't, there was  a lot of flashes of, you should probably do something, because you might not be here 
[02:14:00]  for very long.  So that really drove me, and you know how it is, the fans, dude.  I got into this, and I pumped people up, and people pumped me back, and we're all fucking  each other in the ass, and now I'm amped.  Do you ever enjoy it?  I love it.  It's the number one, me and my kids, and then radio.  I follow you on Twitter, and it seems like you're almost never satisfied.  Oh, yeah, fuck yeah.  Okay.  But that's, you know, that's what therapy is for.  There's a difference between loving something and being satisfied, too, you know?  Yeah, but I think if you love something, that brings in some satisfaction, right? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, but you always want a little more of something, you know?  I get a lot of satisfaction, but I don't, I think that we're all the same here.  We're never satisfied.  No.  Why would you still be here?  I mean, you guys have been, you've done it all.  I mean, I've heard, listen, you've got fucking cars and guns and houses and shit.  Yeah, it's just a pisser.  And hot fucking little girls and shit.  What the fuck?  Like, some people would be like, that's enough for me.  I was like, a jet ski's enough for me.  It's not.  I need a boat.  I need to run over P. Diddy in the ocean.  We're in the same boat.  We want more, you know? 
[02:15:00]  And we don't feel like this place is really, really understanding that yet.  I hope they understand it before we fucking find something else.  Oh, I really hope you guys don't go.  We're very stagnant here, unfortunately.  We had a lot going on before we entered this building, and that's where all my frustration comes from.  We had comedy tours and animation festivals.  Why don't you do that again?  In our own studio that we were proud of.  We try.  It was all just kind of taken away from us.  You hear the business end of it, and it's like, well, this isn't viable for this, that, and the other reason. 
[02:15:30]  You're like, okay, fine.  And we're kind of lost.  Kind of lost?  No, we're kind of lost as far as that part goes.  On a day-to-day basis, we're not lost.  We're still kicking it on this show.  But we want more.  I miss doing those comedy festivals.  They were awesome, man.  We did it three, four summers in a row.  You can't do it again?  I just do it by myself.  That Ellis Mania shit, that ain't no fucking serious XM thing I'm going to show you.  I guess we're going to have to.  Yeah.  It's not that difficult.  I guess because we're just sitting back expecting them. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, don't wait.  Don't do that.  Let me tell you something, though.  Then they chime in with they want a piece of it.  Oh, okay, my new TV show?  Yeah.  But I don't want to go too far.  I hear what you're saying.  Yeah, thank you.  You don't even have to go any further.  I know exactly what you're saying.  Three years in the making, and then we're ready, and then all of a sudden, way ho ho ho.  Yeah.  And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?  Really?  How did I get here by myself?  Right.  Now you want to fucking jump on my back?  How do you chime in on that one?  I just move. 
[02:16:30]  I just keep moving.  I don't care.  I'm like, okay, good.  Jump on.  I'll carry all you motherfuckers.  I don't give a shit.  You're not going to give up.  Right.  I'm not going to stop.  No, I know.  We've got to figure it out.  You guys are bigger than me.  Why don't you just fucking do OP mania?  Fuck it.  I'll show up and kick the shit out of your fans.  No, we've got to figure it out.  We've been kind of sitting back just waiting for them.  It's never going to happen.  Yeah.  Never.  Yeah, it's just that.  We will never do it.  I knew that a long time with somebody from the, what is it, the political radio? 
[02:17:00]  I don't know who it is.  The bald dude?  POTUS.  Pete Thomas.  Yeah, he cornered me one day.  I was like, you and me, man.  We're the future, right?  I'm like, oh my God, dude.  We're going to go into Skuggarees.  He's like, tell them like it is.  You don't get it, dude.  You can't tell anybody in here what it is.  You fucking make yourself or you're fucked.  That's the end of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  There's no team meeting.  That's the future.  We'll fucking unite and quit.  They don't care.  They don't.  They don't let anybody walk.  Just go, dude.  Do it yourself.  A lot of very talented people have left. 
[02:17:30]  They just left.  They don't care.  I can't.  And they don't care because then they replace them with dummies.  I can't.  There's a bunch of dummies walking around this place.  I don't respect most of them.  I can't leave satellite because I can't do normal.  I don't want to do normal radio.  I don't make it.  I'm not satisfied enough to be G-rated.  No, that's the problem, though.  They know that.  They know there's nothing out there on regular radio.  I agree with them.  Good.  Keep me.  Watch me fucking make it.  And you won't.  Okay, don't pay me a million dollars.  Don't think I won't get it another way.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:18:00]  You know?  I mean, think about it.  I have a lot of fans.  It ain't from fucking TV shows.  It's from my radio show.  Yeah.  So I'm very thankful.  It's one of those deals, too, where you've just got to, you know, line everything up that  that you can do by yourself and see what happens.  If this goes to shit, then it goes to shit.  But you have another place to go.  Isn't it making billions of dollars?  Yeah, apparently.  Well, then we're good.  We did that.  Yeah.  We've got the FU money now.  You've got FU money?  Oh, yeah.  Well, fuck both of you guys.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, I know you've got a ton. 
[02:18:30]  Sam, you're both.  I certainly don't.  Rightfully so.  Most of my money comes from stand-up, though.  Yeah.  This is not the biggest part of my money at all.  It's stand-up.  But don't you think the stand-up is a radio show?  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  It certainly helps.  I love doing it.  You make millions of dollars, right?  I do okay.  Fuck, no.  I don't.  Not at all.  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  I know you're clicking a million a year.  No.  All three of you motherfuckers are.  I'm telling you that I do good.  The money I make here could be, if I worked a lot more on the road, I could make what  I make here, honestly.  Yeah.  But I do love doing it. 
[02:19:00]  Because I love doing this, and it does help with gigs.  Okay.  But it's like, I'm paid off in my apartment, so I'm in decent shape.  Yeah, yeah.  You own your apartment.  That's huge.  You got a shiny car?  Fuck you car?  It's a lease.  Yeah, but is it a fuck you car?  It's nice.  Yeah, it's nice.  There you go, man.  You get in your fuck you car, and you say, fuck you?  Come on.  It ain't so bad.  Okay, Scott Greasey's got a better fuck you car.  So what?  Don't worry about him.  Think about all the people beneath you.  Sam, you fucking dishwashing shitbag.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got nothing.  He's just going to be like, hey, man.  I could always look at Sam and feel good about myself. 
[02:19:30]  See?  He's right here to help you every day.  He's talking Jerry Sandusky.  I was over Sam's house recently.  He has the smallest TV I've ever seen.  Even when I was poor, I used to have a big TV.  Is it a flat screen at least?  Yeah, it's a flat screen.  It's like, you know.  How old is it?  Sam's a cheapskate.  He's a little guy.  He's a cheapskate.  I'm a small person.  It's big to me.  The one in the living room is really small, and then the one in the bedroom is even smaller.  You've got two.  That's fucking one more than me. 
[02:20:00]  When you were poor, you always made sure you got the biggest fucking TV, right?  No.  Why not?  I just, I don't know.  I was into that, yeah.  Drinking.  You know what the thing is, though?  See, he's got a girl that's way out of his league.  He's got a girlfriend.  He's got a fiance.  Getting married.  Excuse me.  He's got to take care of it.  I'm 28.  Good idea to get married.  28.  Oh, God.  Another, what, 60 years of bliss?  Power move there by Sam. 
[02:20:30]  Broke with a fucking baby TV getting married.  Good idea.  Oh, man.  The one in the bedroom is horrible.  It's a 12-inch Quasar TV VCR.  Quasar?  It's horrible.  You should have kids.  How's the hospital?  Plenty of kids.  Is it 12 inches?  Do it, Sam.  Is it 12 inches?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Barely.  I mean, but it's there, diagonal.  Diagonal?  It's about what?  12 inches.  12 inches diagonal.  That's how big his TV is.  Just look at your fucking laptop.  Save the money.  Exactly.  You know, from three inches away, a 12-inch screen looks huge. 
[02:21:00]  He's in bed, though.  He has to look across the room at this.  But doesn't that feel good right there?  You're telling me.  He fucking sucks.  He's getting married.  He's going to have kids.  It's going to suck.  You're going to get divorced.  You're fucking broke.  You can't even afford.  She's not even going to get any of your money.  You guys are ripping.  I know Sam doesn't make a lot of money around here, but he still is a cheapskate.  Yeah, you are cheap.  Well, it's hard to be cheap when there's no money.  Yeah, you should pay.  You're broke.  Yeah.  What am I going to spend?  You max out your fucking credit cards.  I'm not going to get into debt.  You use a credit card?  No.  Okay.  Good. 
[02:21:30]  There you go.  Max out that fucking shit.  Don't listen to it.  I'm not American.  I always maxed out mine knowing I was going to make it eventually.  Max out that shit.  Okay.  Look at that angle.  Okay.  Positive attitude.  Max it out because you're going to be able to pay it off.  You're going to make it, Sam.  Does Jess look at rich guys and think like, God, what could be?  Jess is satisfied because of my potential earnings.  Oh, really?  That's right.  She doesn't look at other maybe radio guys that have big houses.  Penises in their house instead of 12-inch television.  Shawnee cows.  Yeah.  You talking about the compound specifically? 
[02:22:00]  I was just bringing up just that.  Houses in Long Island that she's been to.  Just a generic.  She would get tired of your shenanigans.  Oh, please.  Of course she would.  So would he.  Yeah.  They all do after a while, Jimmy.  Rotate.  They all do.  They all just get tired in the end.  They all get tired of it in the end.  Fuck this shit.  In the end, just get a dog.  You'll be all right.  He'll get a dog.  Whether sometimes it's years or months, whatever it is.  Just go sailing with a fucking poodle or something. 
[02:22:30]  Jonathan's walking down the hall.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to come in and sit down.  Yeah.  This guy has some stories, too, Jason.  Who's this?  He's one of Jimmy's guys.  My manager.  He travels the world and goes to crazy-ass places.  Oh, yeah.  Doesn't he go to Thailand?  Jonathan!  Hey, man.  You're kidding.  Hey, buddy.  Jason Ellis.  There he is.  How you doing, man?  That's Jason.  How you doing, mate?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Thailand, huh?  No, he's more like...  Where have you been lately, Jonathan?  How about Myanmar?  Uzbekistan.  Where?  Uzbekistan.  Uzbekistan? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Uzbekistan.  Is that near Pakistan?  Where is that shit?  It's a double-landlocked country between Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.  Oh.  Wow.  That's all that old Soviet bloc shit.  Yeah, it's the bureaucratic empire of a man named Islam Karamov.  Oh.  Who is the leader.  He's been in power since 1990.  They were the only country that didn't want to leave the Soviet Union.  They were sad when they broke up.  Just the people that love being fucking dominated over. 
[02:23:30]  And why did you decide, I need to go there?  Well, it seemed like a cool thing to do at the time.  It's the one place you don't want to get sick.  I got violently sick there in this room that it was like a safe house, guest house thing.  You do not want to be sick in this room that I was sick in.  It was really bad.  Did you just think you were going to die there?  Yeah, I did.  I still don't understand why you're saying it.  We don't know why.  You don't get sick.  I'm still very confused.  It was a bathroom that you don't want to be sick in. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, wow.  And the toilet paper there doesn't have perforations.  It's like, they call it scrag.  And it's just scrag.  You make your ass with scrag.  It's awful.  I would actually just wait until I was back on the plane to shit.  How can you hold that in?  It doesn't make any sense.  I'm really good at that.  It comes from kneeling and holding shits in.  It could be bad for your bowels, though, right?  Very bad for you.  I'll shit anywhere.  Weren't you with scrag back in the 70s?  The opium scrag show?  Yeah, opium scrag. 
[02:24:30]  On your radio.  I think you can buy arms there.  Yeah?  Like, not just guns.  Arms.  Oh, like arms.  Artillery.  Yeah, you hear that correctly.  Fuck the guns.  You can buy arms.  That'd be fun.  I don't know.  I'm trying to explain you to Jason.  Like, Jimmy brought it to our attention.  Like, he goes to these African countries that are fucking fucked up places.  Yeah, but why?  I still haven't been there.  I still didn't get a why.  Are you saving the world or what's going on?  Where they have the local parade for the new local king, that type of shit. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, why?  He's with the agency.  Because it's cool.  It's cool?  Have you ever been with that fucking Costa Rica and surfing?  I've been there.  I've been there.  You're over it now.  Look, you're going to places to get violently sick.  That's your new thing.  This is the first time I ever got sick on a trip.  First time ever.  But you like going to ghetto places where people are just fucked and you sit there and  enjoy yourself.  He looks around and goes, wow, it's like us looking at Sam.  Why fly somewhere where you can just stare at Sam?  He's right here in the studio.  He gets all the shots. 
[02:25:30]  He gets all the shots for these countries and he goes.  You're in the backwoods or the mountainside of Afghanistan too, right?  Not just in Afghanistan, Jason.  He took the fucking car and checked things out.  I have to show you a picture.  I'm going to pull it out.  I'm not going to get an answer on why.  I don't think he knows because I asked for a long time.  I'm in the middle of negotiating a special.  It's like, where is he?  I don't know.  Some place they cut clits off.  It's like, how am I going to contact you?  Right.  What, what, uh, well, Jonathan, what was your first trip going way back? 
[02:26:00]  Well, the first one, like the first crazy one, Africa.  I went by myself and I drove across West Africa.  That was, that was.  No one does that.  And the funny thing was, I was too scared to make a deal with like a, uh, too stupid,  I should say, to make a deal with like a tourist, like a travel company to have the guide set  up and meet me at the airport.  I thought, well, I can't trust that stupidly.  So I thought, well, I'll just meet someone there and hire them to take me around. 
[02:26:30]  And then I realized when I got to the airport and I met this guy wearing a dashiki, you  know, and a big hat.  It was like, it was like out of the Eddie Murphy movie.  Yeah.  Did anybody show up with a thousand nails in their fucking head and say, welcome to my  house.  You are the hideous pain of life traveling with people who are suffering all day.  Do you save any of them?  Well, I try, I don't try to like, you know, make it worse for them.  He's on vacation.  Wait, wait.  It's vacation.  So you met this guy and then what happened? 
[02:27:00]  This was your first trip.  He took, uh, yeah, I hired him and then literally he said, oh, I have a friend who can drive  you across the country because I was a little scared about actually physically driving myself.  And so we went to this guy's house, the whole thing.  I mean, now that I think about it, that was pretty stupid.  Yeah.  And we went to this guy's house and, uh, we met him.  He then said, oh, okay, great.  And, uh, we then we did this weird car swap thing that like, I thought I was going to die  when that happened, but then it was fine. 
[02:27:30]  And then we drove, you know, from Mali to Burkina Faso to Ivory Coast and a bunch of-  I just picture a map with the arrow moving on it like Indiana Jones.  I'm just picturing someone's click getting cut off.  That too.  Yeah.  I had, I had, I, there's a picture I'm trying to find here on my phone to show you guys  of, uh, when I went to Uzbekistan, I, I texted Patrice, uh, cause he was, he, he was really  upset that I was going there.  And, uh, the airline Uzbekistan Airways, their slogan is good luck. 
[02:28:00]  Man, I feel really good about my life between you and Sam.  Thank you very much.  I might go, I might go ahead and celebrate.  It's crazy.  Uh, uh, Jimmy brings these stories to us all the time.  It's insane.  You got, you got, uh, Dane Cook coming in?  Yeah.  Dane's right outside the studio.  We got to take a break.  I did a quick break.  I did a roast for Carrie Hart and Dane Cook came out after it and Dane Cook said, give  it up for Jason Ellis, the funniest person in the building.  Wow. 
[02:28:30]  And it really, really meant a lot coming from somebody who's, and I don't care.  And if he comes in, don't, I don't want him to fucking answer the question.  I just want to take it as that's what it was.  It was real.  He didn't joke.  He was very serious.  Very, very funny.  Thank you.  Oh my God.  You're showing him back a stand or coming off.  That's the, uh, the plane going into the clouds.  Plane going into the clouds.  It says, good luck.  Wow.  That's.  That's some creepy shit.  That's their logo?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Good luck, Dr. Jones.  I want to get into some more of your traveling stories, but we're going to take a break at 
[02:29:00]  Dane Cook in here.  And get Dane in, yeah.  And Jason's album is called, the band is called Death, Death, Die.  It's a ninja flying eagles.  And I'm going to play some of this on the Boneyard.  Yeah.  Can you play?  Totemoto Bodosaki would go good on the Boneyard.  I love you on the Boneyard, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  You actually made me, I called Scott Greenstein and said, can I DJ?  An hour on a channel and he said yes and I never did.  You know how that is.  Oh, it's fine, man.  But I would love to.  You do it.  You're the best guy, best DJ on radio besides Bob Dylan.  Oh, thanks, man. 
[02:29:30]  Bob Dylan is so obscure that I fucking love him.  I'm like, what the fuck are you on?  You twist it.  It is an amazing radio show.  It blows my mind.  Yeah.  I listen every fucking time.  No problem.  He's a genius.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you, Jason.  In Faction, every afternoon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Three to seven.  You know, whatever.  I own that shit.  Is it on Sirius NXM?  I get all confused.  Yeah, it's on both the same.  41 on both.  Oh, cool.  Oh, look at that.  We don't get that.  Can't be done.  I know.  We don't get that.  I went to tweet what channel you're on and Colin said 206 and some other one. 
[02:30:00]  I'm like, what?  Why aren't they just one fucking number?  That would be nice, wouldn't it?  I don't know.  Just more stupidity from the conference.  I don't even know what channel we're on.  You're on 206 on Sirius.  I know that.  And 190.  105.  Yes.  Oh, 105.  See, I swear to God, I just said 190.  I was going to say 198.  No, that's right.  It's 105, right?  Yeah.  I get confused every fucking time.  Don't be gay, America.  Go on iTunes and get the Totemoto, Bodosaki or the Pain of Time so that we are ahead of Nickelback 
[02:30:30]  and Daltry.  Yes.  You are all facts.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  The Opie Realtory Show.  Into another diamond.  The terrible haze has lit the shine. 
[02:31:00]  See the angels with power.  Hey, it's been a while.  Very happy to say Dane Cook is in the studio.  What's up, Dane?  What's going on, guys?  Ah, well, we all know what's going on.  I know, I know.  Dane Cook is in the studio.  Right.  Yeah.  You know that thing.  Yeah.  We had a good show yesterday.  Oh, I heard.  The comics were in the studio.  Everybody.  I heard.  And then Bobby posted a faded retro photo up on his Instagram of all you guys down at the 
[02:31:30]  cellar.  And it was really cool to see.  Yeah.  He's got this weird photo app because we, at Patrice's Barbecue, there was a picture of  it.  It's, I think it's Patrice Voss, me, and I forget who else is in the photo.  Bobby took it and he's got this iPhone app.  It looks actually kind of cool.  Like, he took it like 40 years ago.  He's fucked up.  Yeah.  He takes these pictures that.  That's the Instagram, right?  That pretty much look, yeah.  It's like hip now to have a picture that looks like it was taken with a Polaroid back in the  70s.  It kind of is, though.  It makes everyone look like a photographer. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, but remember when you went, when you could actually take those pictures and all  you wanted was a clear fucking picture from a professional camera?  But now the app puts red eye on everyone.  That's part of it.  We all look like lichens.  Red eye scratches, all kinds of shit.  Which is stupid.  That one sunbursted person, like it just places it over their face.  We finally figured it all out, but that's not good enough for us.  Now we have to go backwards.  We're just dumb as humans.  We do that constantly.  Like, it was the bigger the computer, the better.  And now, you know, unless it's a little fucking Mac mini, it's a piece of shit. 
[02:32:30]  And phones, the same thing.  Everything got smaller and smaller and smaller until you realize, nah, it's got to be a little  bigger so I can see the pictures on it.  Yeah, we even figured out the phone where it was like, there was nothing.  I had a phone at one point when I think phones were at their smallest.  It was about the size of one of those miniature Mounds candy bars to give away for a fucking  Halloween.  It was a fun-sized phone.  Yeah, it was a fun-sized phone.  Literally a fun-sized phone.  Yeah.  It's like, nah, now we've got to make them big again. 
[02:33:00]  We got bored with the small phones.  We got video on this shit now.  It's got to be a little bigger.  I love people that are not ever happy at how advanced it is.  It's like, yeah, it'll be cool though when it's like a thing you can wear in your eye  that just shows a heads-up display, you know?  You don't really have to carry anything anymore.  Yeah, because that's such a hassle.  Yeah, I'm lugging around my...  Your two-ounce.  Giant phone.  Yeah.  It is weird though how like, because technology changes so fast, all of a sudden this is not  good enough anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  This seems like primitive garbage.  Dude, you want something better. 
[02:33:30]  It's so weird.  Always.  We suck as humans.  Gotta ask Dane about Patrice, obviously.  You guys started together, man.  Yeah, we did.  In Boston, right?  Yeah.  This is like, I know you guys have been...  It's...  This is unbelievable.  It's like, never going to hear that big laugh again.  That's the first thing I thought of.  I was like, oh man.  You know, if you made Patrice laugh, you felt like...  Funny.  Oh yeah.  It kind of reset.  You're funny.  For me anyway, it was like, okay, yeah, I should stick around Patrice's...  It validated you. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, because he wasn't...  He was no BS.  You know, Patrice...  Patrice, the best advice he ever gave me, and what I...  My first thought of him is, I was at Nick's Comedy Stop.  It was 1991, and we were still just getting to know each other.  I remember I was sitting with him.  He had his Discman on.  He had his headphones on, and I was trying to get to know him a little bit, and I tapped  him.  I was like, what are you listening to?  And he's like, yeah, you wouldn't know him.  I mean, you know, this...  I finally broke it down.  It was...  He was listening to like a bootleg version of Notorious B.I.G., and he played me that 
[02:34:30]  before, you know, anybody had even heard of this guy, and he was still Bruiser.  We were calling him Bruiser.  It was before he was Patrice.  Bruiser.  Yeah, he was Bruiser for the first few years back in Boston, but I remember that night  having our first Heart to Heart, and he said to me, he said, you know, man, you can't...  You can't fuck with the truth, be the truth, always, and everything will roll off, even  if it's your negative truth, bad truth, and it was the first time anybody had really... 
[02:35:00]  Talk about like, I'm from Arlington, Massachusetts.  I'd experienced, you know, very little, and this guy's from Roxbury, and, you know, had seen  everything already by the time he hit comedy, so...  Yeah, because he's 21 when he's saying this to you.  Yeah, I admired him right there.  Unbelievable.  Well, he was that at 21.  He started, what, 92, 91 he started?  Yeah, I was like, end of 91, and I think I met him at Stitches the first time, and he  was like, shy, and still kind of, you know, it was wonderful to see him...  That's so funny to even think of him being shy. 
[02:35:30]  And when he said you should embrace the truth, when he said you should embrace the truth,  he just said you're listening to a bootleg and calling yourself Bruiser.  Now that would have been a great fucking slap in the face.  I don't know if you guys have touched on this, but, like, you know, in the feeble attempt  to, like, find humor in any way, shape, or form, especially this week, I'm like, I know  Patrice is somewhere trying to communicate with somebody, like, update my fucking Twitter,  please.  Do not let my existence hang on an AT&T joke. 
[02:36:00]  Someone hacked that account.  Oh, shit, that's right.  Please.  That's right.  What was the line?  It was his last tweet, which is always creepy, man.  Read that, Sam.  L-M-A-O.  Right there, you know, he's like, L-M-A-O, what am I doing?  You went out with a fucking teenage girl.  Fucking, what's the matter with you?  That's one short of using an emoji.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit, not a single human gives a shit about AT&T. 
[02:36:30]  I'm mad because the bitch kept calling me and wouldn't stop.  Calling me ma'am.  Calling me ma'am and wouldn't stop.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's kind of funny.  Oh, God.  Humiliating.  Yeah.  Admitting that the girl's name or his voice is something.  Right.  That's probably what it was.  Yeah, it's a girl's name.  Well, Patrice, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's funny.  Oh, my God.  He gives his password and then it fixes Twitter for him.  Yeah, really?  Jesus Christ.  It is a miserable, miserable thing, though. 
[02:37:00]  It's like, you know, you keep going back, and even when we're having a good time or whatever,  it's like, it's there.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you can't get away from it.  Ever looming.  When he died, it was like, okay, now here's where it is.  Like, you didn't know for a while, is he going to just live in this horrible, horrible condition,  which nobody wanted.  Nobody wanted him to be alive in that terrible place.  Including himself.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  Or his family or nobody.  It's just, you know, nature takes its course.  I mean, it's what happens.  Um, and now you have to start like, okay, now I have to really grieve and fucking. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  But you get angry.  I mean, I know my dad, my dad, who had been dying of cancer, had a stroke about a month  before the cancer got really bad.  And I remember being so frustrated and pissed off because, you know, you want to, you want  somebody to have that last moment to be able to really kind of speak their mind about things  and whatever they want to kind of, you know, their closing bit, so to speak, you want to  give them that shot.  So that's where a lot of my frustration was.  It's like, ah, you know, I wish he had a chance to.  That is kind of a smack in the fucking face.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  It's like, I've been dealing that with, like I said, my own pop for a few years.  Not, you know, here he is like in this state and I'm like, I can't even, because he had  a stroke and then he was, uh, uh, he had that, uh, syndrome where you, one word gets  locked into your mind.  And so he's trying to say, uh, you know, oh, it's great to be back in the show.  And he would say like, school, school, school, school, school.  What is that?  I've never heard of that.  Um, I've heard of locked, locked in syndrome, which is where you can't communicate.  It's a very, it's similar.  It's, it's like, uh, where a word flickers into your brain and that's what you'll say  for sometimes days or weeks. 
[02:38:30]  Fuck.  But can you think other things or is that?  Yes.  Oh, but you're, but you're, you're, you're, you're motor skills only.  Exactly.  It's like skipping.  Okay.  So my dad said school and then it was cool.  And then it was, and that's all he could say.  So it was like, here I am.  I'm his only son trying to have that, you know, that conversation right there.  You know what I mean?  About, you know, dad, you know, I'm going to, I'll take care of things for you, whatever  it is that you want to say.  And, and I felt that same and I feel that same kind of frustration with Patrice.  I hadn't talked to him in a while either.  And that, uh, that's, that's always going to be a real bummer, you know? 
[02:39:00]  So, uh, yeah, man, this sucks.  But he knew the thing about Patrice is he was so smart.  He knew what the relationships were.  Right.  There was no need.  You have to have confidence in that.  Right.  He knows.  Like, he's not like one of those guys that needed things reconfirmed.  Oh, yeah.  Because Patrice wasn't a guy that would always confirm things with you.  He knew, if you were friends with him, he knew you knew.  It was a weird understanding with him.  There was a way of like, you'd see him and it was like, there was no time passage.  Yeah, yeah.  Some people, you have to rebuild the, we're okay with each other, let's remove the stuff. 
[02:39:30]  But yeah, he was just like, so man, what happened with the, and it was like, that was four years ago, buddy.  When my dad died, my sister was all about that.  I wish I could have saw him one more time.  And I'm like, did you have a good relationship with him?  It's, it's cool.  You didn't have to, you know, see him one last time.  Yeah.  You know, you just got to have confidence that you had, you had the, you had that relationship and that time.  Yeah.  I was really happy.  I'll tell you guys this.  I was at the, uh, uh, coconut grove improv, uh, down at Miami and I brought Patrice down 
[02:40:00]  and it was, uh, I was headlining.  I was bringing Patrice.  He was blowing me off the stage and it was literally like, I shouldn't be bringing, I  shouldn't have him featuring because 45 minutes in the middle spot, 45, 45 and then going into  his closing bed, which is another 40.  Uh, but it was, it was like selfishly because I wanted to see him.  I wanted to, uh, because I was also a fan.  And so, uh, but I remember us sitting at, uh, uh, the Miami wings, the big wings place.  He, we would hit that spot after. 
[02:40:30]  And I remember he was dating a girl and, uh, and he was coming to me going, you know, um,  I'm in a bad way with my girl.  I love her, but I'm not sure I'm in love.  And we had, and I was kind of in the same place.  I remember we both basically had the talk where we okayed each other to break up with  our, with our girls.  And I probably went on to four or five more, you know, superfluous whores.  And he met, he met Vaughn.  Yeah.  And, uh, I was always happy.  And I remember he was always like, we were always appreciative of that.  We had that talk and that, you know, he went on to meet somebody great. 
[02:41:00]  And I went on to, you know, avoid herpes.  Lucky you.  I think he downplays it, but he was, he was in love, man.  I saw it after his gigs, he would go off with her and just tell he was in a good place with  her.  With fun?  Yeah.  Very much so.  Yeah.  You know, a guy that has a lot to say about women, you know, in the end, man, he was in  love.  He would always talk about like being a, her being a soldier or him being this and that. 
[02:41:30]  And it was like, you phony.  You know, she's way too fucking hot for you.  Right.  And you're paranoid.  She's going to leave.  He was, there's no way he wasn't scared she was leaving.  Yeah.  And he was such a good actor and such a good talker that he actually convinced her that  she's lucky to have him.  Right.  The other way around.  He convinced her.  He was such a great psychologist.  He was a master interrogator and a master psychologist.  He really, he, like, I think he convinced me one night that I was black.  He convinced me. 
[02:42:00]  He, I don't know how he did it.  But by the end of the conversation, I was like, I'm going to check my ancestry.com or  something.  I don't know, man.  He was like, you can't do that.  Everybody started wondering, why is Dane being late for gigs?  We're going to talk about Patrice.  I'm running the light.  Yeah.  How many times did you see him in the bath of that red light to get the fuck off stage  light?  I never wanted to go on after him.  I love going on before him and working with him, but it was like, I don't want to be bothered  if he's going over.  Like, I don't want to care.  Right.  Because I want to just enjoy it.  Like, you know, he was, fuck, man. 
[02:42:30]  Did some news reporters say he was 14?  Oh, my God.  Yes.  I'm fine.  Please.  I would love to.  I mean, it's kind of rough to hear up until the last second of this.  When you heard Piers Morgan refer to him as she.  She, her, her.  You were on, right?  Cringe.  God.  Had to be.  Because he didn't know him.  He didn't know him.  There's no way he knew him.  But I, but I could only appreciate it because I know how many times it happened early in  the career where, you know, we'd go to a gig and we'd bring Patrice and somebody'd be  like, oh, I thought he was going to be a small white woman. 
[02:43:00]  And they'd be like frightened.  Bigger than light.  Piers B. Research.  Here's how it went down.  Fox in New York.  Sad news tonight from the entertainment world.  Comedian Patrice O'Neill has died.  O'Neill died this morning from complications from a stroke he suffered last month.  The Boston native appeared in September's Comedy Central's roast of Charmage.  Charlie Sheen, where his struggle with diabetes was a punchline for many jokes.  O'Neill was a well-known presence on talk shows in the stand-up industry and was a frequent 
[02:43:30]  guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  He was 14 years old.  How do you make that mistake?  Oh, my God.  All you have to do is read.  That wasn't like I just read the prompter on.  That was I'm committed to my false, fake, teleprompter reading zombie hood.  Because these idiots don't know what they're even reading.  All that fucking, all the shit he read before that should have let him know he could not  possibly be 14 years old.  But he said it with confidence. 
[02:44:00]  He was 14 years old.  He was 14 years old.  That's a hell of a career, huh?  All right.  I was fucking delivering papers at 14.  This guy was on all those TV shows at 14 years old.  Yeah, real forced in the industry by 14.  How dumb does that say our show is?  We had this 14-year-old on all the time.  They can arrest us now.  Yeah, when's the last time you saw him?  I think maybe through here the last time I came through.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we'd spoken a couple times but saw him here.  Yeah, you guys are all off doing your own thing. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, it was tough after a while, right?  Yeah, especially it's like comics were so vicinity-wise too, hanging out with each other  that once you're on the other coast, it's even more so like, nah, you don't matter right now.  He was on our show for the last time, October 14th, I think.  I don't remember.  It was for the Carolines gigs.  Yes.  And then it happened a mere days or a week later.  No, no, Joe, what?  Three days after.  Three days after?  Carolines?  He did Carolines that weekend and then it was a Wednesday, I think. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, that's true.  And I was lucky enough to go to that show.  I didn't see Patrice for a while and I was like, fuck, I want to go see him.  And we had the best time, you know, in that back room of Carolines, just shooting the shit,  laughing our balls off.  He sold out.  I mean, that was like the first time he really genuinely sold out.  Oh my God, the place was packed.  Yeah.  He was on his way.  That's just no fucking justice.  Really?  No, Charlie Sheenhouse was a big one.  It let everybody see exactly what, that's exactly what he was like.  Just dismissive. 
[02:45:30]  He was one of the best ever.  Yeah.  He was one of the best ever.  Yeah, he was.  There's no doubt.  And we always knew, right from the get-go.  You know, it was like, I'm working with one of the greatest comics I'll ever see.  Working with something special.  Yeah, because, and he did it on the Charlie Sheen roast.  He could throw it all away.  Yeah.  And there's comics that work the room, like, I'll throw it away and I'm just gonna, like,  I'll piece it apart with you.  He'd throw it away and then he'd come up with a whole other perspective without even needing  to go and get the help from, like, oh, what's your deal? 
[02:46:00]  What do you, and to see that and to watch it on the roast was, uh.  He made up, he made most of that up on the spot.  He'd make you want to quit.  He'd make you want to drive home with no music on and just think about, what am I really saying  up there?  Hoping there's a cliff around the corner you could go over.  He loved Pat Cooper, too.  And Pat liked him a lot.  They were great on Top Crowd together.  And we had both of them on.  Oh, were they in together?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, they worked well together.  Two fucking loud guys.  Oh, yeah, Patrice would just start railing on him. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, it was great.  Pat loved him.  What about when he dissected Gallagher on our show?  Oh, God.  What was that?  God damn, was that good.  That was a guy that almost killed himself after our show.  Oh, man, was he fucking pissed and depressed.  Calling him a racist and all sorts of shit.  Gallagher, you're a racist.  Oh, my God.  Gallagher is an old racist.  Call him Leo, Iraq.  Reminded me.  Calling him by his real name.  Hey, Leo. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, Leo.  No, Leo, you're a racist.  Oh, man.  Oh, what did he say?  I bet you imagine them watermelons and all little black babies.  Right.  I love the clip of him singing, which I'd never seen, with the blues guy that you posted.  Oh, that was awesome, man.  I cried like a baby watching that.  It was amazing.  I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do.  But he came in here, Warren Haynes, and what creeps me out is he picked that song.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He picked it and knew it well, because last night I went and listened to the original. 
[02:47:30]  He sang it like Howling Wolf did.  Yeah.  He knew that fucking song, man.  You know how, like, kind of as things were unfolding, it was like everybody was kind of holding their breath and not really able to be emotional about it.  And it was Bobby who said, like, the most kind of, like, offhanded but, like, perfect moment that was heartbreaking.  We were on the phone a couple weeks ago, and we're talking about Patrice.  And then Bobby, which just gets really quiet, and he goes, dude, he's never going to play the next Call of Duty, dude. 
[02:48:00]  And he would have loved that game, dude.  Jesus.  And it really hurt.  That, like, yeah.  He did.  He's never going to see the new iPhone, and he's never going to.  Bobby's little retarded mind.  That should be in a book called From the Minds of Idiots.  That's how Bobby relates death.  But he also, he's also one of those guys that got to make sure it hurts even more.  It's like, Bobby, relax.  It hurts.  You don't have to make it worse.  You don't have to make it worse. 
[02:48:30]  You don't have to make it worse.  And list all the things he'll never do.  But that is a weird revelation, and it's something really simple.  Those simple things?  Yeah, because it's like, it's something tangible.  You're right.  Death or eternity is intangible.  Well, what is it?  It's there.  It's the future.  But, like, this next, we all know the cycle between certain things.  Wow.  He'll never see the fucking Titanic 3D that's coming out, because you know when that's happening.  And it's really weird.  That's coming out?  Yeah, really.  I can't wait.  You can see that guy fall off the back.  I know. 
[02:49:00]  The ISO is going to feel like it's falling on you.  But, you know, something like that, you just know what it means.  We were looking forward to Dane Cook coming by, because it's been a while.  Because you've got this new movie, Answers to Nothing.  And me and Jimmy saw it.  It's very good, man.  I fucking like this movie, man.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  The first copy that Roland gave me, I couldn't watch it, because it was stamped on the wrong fucking side.  So then I got scared they weren't seeing another copy.  But then they ended up giving me one.  I told you the opening scene was amazing.  Opening scene is...  Can we talk about it? 
[02:49:30]  I don't know what...  You know, you never know what you want to say about a movie, because you don't want to give shit away.  Yeah, no, it's...  I'll say this.  I thought the movie was going to be totally different than it was from the opening scene.  I thought it was one thing, and then I was like, oh, this is...  Okay.  It's not.  It's hardcore.  It's, you know, kind of like one of those grab-you-by-the-throat openings that, you know...  If you're not invested at that point, just bail.  If you don't like the movie in the first five minutes, then have a nice day.  It covers cheating.  It covers child molesting. 
[02:50:00]  It covers a lot of fucking ground that you don't see covered a certain way.  It was very good.  Alcoholism.  I don't want to give it anything away.  You're not alcoholism a little bit.  Oh, God, yeah.  Fucking yeah.  But it's kind of in the vein of what I dug about it, is that it's a genre movie in that  Magnolia, Crash way.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of stories.  When we were talking about this movie before you got here, we're like, it sort of has a  Crash vibe to it.  Yeah, the feel of Crash, too.  Where everyone is kind of associated.  There's a lot of different stories going on, but they're all kind of connected.  Yeah.  And you get to play... 
[02:50:30]  She played your wife.  I love her from Lost.  I don't know her name.  Elizabeth Mitchell.  She's sexy.  She's fucking hot, man.  Fuck is she?  Yeah, she is.  Beautiful.  Like, really just one of those actors who can be, like, vulnerable and completely, like,  you know, distant at the same time.  Like, like dual harmonics.  Like, Tori Amos can sing her own harmonies.  You ever heard that?  It's so weird.  Yeah, it is weird.  She can sing and harmonize at the same...  I don't know what the verbiage is for that, but she can sing and do her own harmony at the  same time. 
[02:51:00]  Is that a weird thing that Axl Rose has, too, where the voice does two things at once?  I've heard that described as something.  I just added nothing to the discussion.  Nothing.  Jimmy!  I literally...  I just...  I should have just opened my mouth and just words came out.  I kind of understood what you were saying, though.  I can't listen to those, because people are like, oh, Guns N' Roses back together.  Have you tried to watch him singing anything?  It's tough.  People are in denial.  It's tough.  Especially knowing that he won't do press.  When you know what it used to be.  He's just like...  He just kind of like mumbles and then says whatever the key line of the song is, because 
[02:51:30]  he's too fat, and he's wearing that giant, yellow, Curious George coat.  You've seen it?  It supposedly doesn't look like that anymore, but I don't believe it.  Curious George.  Right?  You've seen the picture.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Look at that.  What is that?  No, that's not even the one.  There's one on stage.  That's terrible, though.  And he's in Brazil, the hottest place on Earth, and he's wearing an L.L. Bean tent.  God, look at it.  That's Axl Rose.  It's amazing. 
[02:52:00]  Axl Rose.  It's the same guy.  Look at his chins.  Yeah, man.  He's a big fucking guy now.  He's a lovely singer.  But, I mean, look, he always wore weird shit, though, right?  Remember?  He's wearing an umpire's vest.  Well, the Mean Machine jersey was my favorite one in that video for Paradise City.  Oh, Paradise City, man.  Yeah.  Great fucking jersey.  But, yeah, he was a weird dresser.  I hate the fact that he just makes the audience wait.  That's why I hate him.  Yeah.  He makes the audience wait.  I've had a long time in Toronto once. 
[02:52:30]  Fucking a long time.  He still does it.  He's not as bad, I don't think, but he still does it.  There's at least two hours, I believe.  It's like one of the Van Zandt brothers.  He's doing his vocal warm-ups, Jimmy.  Didn't fucking get there at 6.30 and do them.  What are you doing?  In between Skid Row and Guns N' Roses, it was like two straight hours.  He's doing.  He's like, what are you doing?  It looks like the Gordon's a Gloucester fisherman with a fucking cowboy hat on.  What is that?  I don't know.  Dick Tracy.  Yellow is very slimming.  This is a good move.  Is it a long coat or is it a long suit jacket without a collar?  What is that? 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  I don't know.  And then he's wearing the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego hat.  My mother bought that computer game when I was younger.  I was younger.  I was in my 20s.  She thought it would be fun.  I was like, this game fucking eats my ass, Bob.  I'm going to play this.  Fuck Carmen.  Who cares where she is.  Exactly.  I hope she's dead in Uzbekistan.  It's not a bad game.  It is a bad game.  What's wrong with you, Jonathan?  You were playing Modern Warfare?  I'm on it, yeah.  Yeah.  You like it?  I wasn't on that night. 
[02:53:30]  You were playing with Bobby and apparently Keith the cop took your care package that came down.  I was pissed.  I was really mad about the whole Patrice thing more, but I think it just came out over a care package in Call of Duties.  And I let into him.  It's like you were dead, though.  No, he was being a selfish little bitch.  And I wanted my UAV.  Now, you have such a notorious reputation for knifings. 
[02:54:00]  I do.  In that game.  Yeah.  You really do.  Do you get more kills with knives or with the guns?  Not on the new one.  The new one, it's impossible.  It's hard.  Yeah, the way they made spawn points and all that crazy, whatever they updated on the AI.  You can't really knife anymore.  So now I'm back to like just semi-automatic.  It just hurts.  The only time you can get knifed.  You like making it hurt.  I get knifed all the time is when I come around a corner and I'm face to face with somebody.  Yeah.  And I never, I don't have that reflex to hit the knife right away.  I always go for the gun and wind up, I get knifed and I'm like, fuck me. 
[02:54:30]  Why can't you have a mirror in that game?  A mirror?  It would be nice.  You would in real life.  I'm constantly getting shot in the back of that guy.  Yeah, the technology of the, the soldiers have like little, uh, heads up.  Yeah, see behind you.  See behind you.  Fuck that.  That would be nice.  But you're probably dealing with somebody using one of those mad cats controllers that  has the extra buttons on the bottom.  Yeah, they have them?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a, and it's not a modded controller.  It's just one with a couple of extra buttons that if you just squeeze, it's going to knife.  Instead of having to push down.  So you get a 14 year old kid who obviously is, you know, faster than any of us anyway. 
[02:55:00]  And he's just, you know, squeezing.  Do you have one of those controllers?  No.  You ever tried to get one?  Yeah.  You ever try to draw your gun up real quick and hit the knife when you're trying to shoot?  Oh, yeah.  I've done that so many times.  You walk up to someone in a room and you're like, ah, cool, man.  I'm going to nail this guy.  And you go to pick your gun up and you hit the knife and then he turns around and just  rakes you.  I hate to say this.  I'm getting too old to play multiplayer because I finally am like really like a platoon  sergeant.  Like I'm really mad at a 14 year old nobody. 
[02:55:30]  I hate this.  You're playing, you get killed and then the kid next to you is literally just facing  the sky doing spins.  And I'm like, you're just fucking spinning.  Cover my six.  What are you doing?  Thanks for the help, asshole.  It's a kid.  Yeah.  I'm really mad.  That's funny.  Spending five minutes trying to get up a ladder.  And then they'll start talking to the front, but leave their mic on.  It's like, I don't know.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to go tomorrow?  Because I think I'm turn off your mic. 
[02:56:00]  I'm in war.  It is terribly.  I don't know.  My mom, she's not getting home for another 15 minutes or so.  I could play for a little longer, but I don't know.  Becky, get it to yourself.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm trying to, you know, you're really taking me out of the game here.  A million times.  Are you going to prestige?  Are you going to prestige?  Why don't you prestige?  You don't prestige your fag.  Prestige.  What does that mean?  If, like, you unlock everything and you hit a level 80, and then you have the option 
[02:56:30]  of starting over, and you get a special badge symbol that says, I gave up everything to  start over.  Oh, okay.  And if you don't do that, you're not considered to be, you're not legitimate.  Have you done it?  I did.  This is the, I finally, just so people would shut up.  And I hated myself for it.  They don't like when you're level 80 and you're walking around and playing the game.  It's like, hey, what are you doing?  You're supposed to fucking give it all away now.  Yeah, it's like, if I had served, you know, in Afghanistan and Iraq and came home, it's 
[02:57:00]  not going to wipe my memory clear and then give me a, you know, a musket and send me  back.  Start over.  You're going to start over out there.  You catch up to me.  Yeah, they don't take your stripes and medals and send you back as a private.  Right, right.  Exactly.  That's what they do.  You get better.  Fuck that.  Prestige.  I play those games, but then I just try to talk everybody into getting along.  He's in a peace summit.  Guys, please.  This is not necessary.  We didn't talk about the movie.  The brand new Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego is very good, Jimmy. 
[02:57:30]  You and your mom should.  My mom loves it.  I want to make sure people see this movie.  Answers to nothing.  It comes out to tomorrow.  Only limited to tomorrow.  It is limited.  And then hopefully they expand the theaters.  People find it.  People get to find it.  It's worth it.  You know, I wouldn't do something that's junk.  I really, I'm proud of it.  It's definitely a departure from some of the comedic stuff.  Definitely.  Oh, yeah.  It is.  There's not many laughs in this movie.  No, no.  It's not a comedy.  No, not at all.  It's New York.  It's, oh, it's on demand? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Starting tomorrow on demand.  It's also BOD.  Yeah.  Okay.  I would absolutely fucking get this on demand.  Absolutely.  I love that that's going on these days.  Where some movies, it's like they put it on demand for, you know, a week or so.  Yeah.  And then it hits theaters and shit like that.  Mm-hmm.  Because I am all about staying home and watching fucking movies.  Right, right.  I hate going to the theater.  Well, now most people have, like, great sound systems.  You got, like, a cool plasma.  It's like, you know, not every movie is a tentpole.  Got to see it with a crowd.  Godzilla affair.  Like, I just want to watch a movie with my girl at home.  Most people have a better system at home. 
[02:58:30]  True.  You go to these theaters and they're like, what?  This stupid screen still.  I got better shit at home.  The seats are uncomfortable.  I can fucking kick back in a chair.  It's fucking great.  Pause it.  Prestige.  Play 10 rounds.  Knife a 14-year-old.  It is nice to be able to pause, go to the fucking, get a beer, take a piss, whatever the  fuck.  And then, you know, just start back up again.  Twitter it.  Share the moment.  What's the highest you can get to?  Level 80?  Level 80, 10 times. 
[02:59:00]  You can prestige 10 times.  And then what happens?  Then after that, you realize that you're nothing.  And then it's like, this was a waste of time.  You should have worked on a trade.  Yeah.  You should have gone to a vocational tech school.  I needed a backup.  I could have been a painter or something.  You have to go through a gender transformation.  That'd be great.  Yeah.  What's your favorite weapon in the game?  I like the, uh, cause I'll do the, I'll do the, um, uh, hardcore, uh, hardcore team.  So I'm using the MC, uh, the M, what is it? 
[02:59:30]  Uh, no, the ACR and I'll throw a grip and a silencer on there.  It's literally one shot.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's why I like playing hardcore mode.  If you, if you're not playing hardcore mode, you could shoot someone like five times in  the chest.  Nothing happens.  They shoot you once and you're dead.  Hardcore.  You pretty much hit someone once in a good spot.  They're dead.  Yeah.  And they die in real life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Butterfly effect takes place.  So it's most important.  You don't, you don't need the automatic fire and shit like that.  So you can trade in that for, uh, you know, maybe not being as obvious to other people 
[03:00:00]  on the map and shit like that, like a silencer or I liked using some of the perks that make  me a little more invisible to a people's radar and shit like that.  Uh, you like to be off the grid is what you're saying.  Off the grid.  Dane.  Yes.  But, uh, yeah, I, I only play hardcore now cause the other shit, it's just like, really?  Yeah.  I sit.  And that's what you hear from me on there.  Really?  Really?  I fucking hit him five times.  Once in the fucking face. 
[03:00:30]  Really?  Dude, play hardcore.  What are you doing, dude?  Play hardcore, dude.  Yeah.  Why don't you play hardcore, you faggot?  All right.  I'm a faggot.  Yes.  Great.  Great.  Kid, just call me a faggot.  I never, I never played that game.  Oh, you should, Jimmy.  You'd love it.  It's my only vice.  I have nothing else.  I've never, alcohol, no addictive personality, but my one thing was video games.  And what was so weird is like, I didn't play for a year.  I actually have not played a full year.  Since the last game, the last version, I think. 
[03:01:00]  Basically.  But I think it's this weird thing from my child.  I was talking with my therapist about it.  Like, I could only play video games when I was younger, when my mom would come home and  be like, you know, you get a pound of pavement, Dan, if you don't, you know, earn your stripes  and yada, yada.  And so I never felt good about playing something unless I worked and earned it.  And because I took pretty much a year off, you know, of comedy and everything else, I  didn't play a game because I really didn't feel like I had done something to warrant it.  Wow.  Okay.  So once I, yeah, once I got back on doing the junk and all that, I was like, oh, I'm going 
[03:01:30]  to get the new one.  Treat yourself.  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  I'm a lazy slob.  I play all the time.  What'd you do in the year off?  Nothing.  Really.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Travel at all?  A little bit.  A little bit.  But just, you know, I went straight.  I was like, I was straight through, man, for a long time.  It was like to that point of just.  Crazy run you had.  You know.  Yeah.  It was like, all right, let's, the first 10 years is the hustle of like, please let me  get out of this, you know, foxhole of, you know, please let my family not behind 
[03:02:00]  my back go.  What did he do?  You know what I mean?  And then you get there and you're like, all right, now I want to maintain it.  But when it blew up for me, like really big, I was like, I got to keep this level.  And so it was like six straight years until, you know, personal stuff starts to happen.  But you're just, you're working through that.  You're like, okay, you know, my mom's sick.  My dad, you're doing all this stuff.  And then you finally realize, ah, it's super unhealthy.  I need to stop and like, you know, chill and like feel some stuff for a minute.  You realize you're not going to just keep going and be satisfied with that, you know, 
[03:02:30]  you know, because you will just keep driving right through it.  True.  And you got to kind of, yeah, stop.  Sometimes it's forced.  Like we were forced to stop when we got fired.  It was kind of nice.  We got the fucking boot.  We were off for two fucking years.  Parts of that was nice.  And it was like, yeah, it was like, ah, I don't have to worry about what the ratings are.  I don't have to worry that we put on a great show yesterday and now here's the next day.  Do it again, asshole.  Yeah.  And you assess like it was great for me and I feel the same way. 
[03:03:00]  It was the best year and you kind of assess and also like appreciate certain things that you wouldn't think to.  You're like so busy just like getting in there next fight, next fight that you don't really stop to be like, oh, yeah, I've done some cool stuff that I could.  That's like some would say enough.  You know, what do I want to do now?  Where do I want to take my fans is what I was asking a year ago.  And I was like, if I don't feel good, then whatever I do is not authentic with them.  So it was like take a year.  And now the stuff that I'm developing, I'm really glad to share with them.  And you really did nothing. 
[03:03:30]  You had to be doing.  I wrote, you know, I wrote, I did a couple of little indies, a couple more.  But I mean, on a regular like day to day, what were you, what would you do?  Hike?  Get up at 10 or sleep all day?  No, definitely was not sleeping.  Just, you know, got up.  My youngest sister came out to L.A.  So I was like, just kind of, I hadn't hung with family in so many years either.  So it was nice to have like family back hanging out with me.  And just like, I felt like I was just doing regular person stuff for a minute, which was  like just wonderful.  But I was still writing and developing, I'm sure now I'm working with NBC on a show, but 
[03:04:00]  I'd worked on that for like the year.  So I was still kind of like pairing up and hanging with people, like people I really admired  that I wanted to just take to lunch and be like, oh, maybe we could figure out if there's  something we want to do together at some point.  So it was just kind of like a re-reforming year, I guess.  A reboot.  A reboot, yes.  You feel like at times that if you're not just plugging away constantly that you're going  to lose it.  You're a failure.  Yeah.  Instantly.  It's like I took the weekend off.  I didn't go to a club this weekend.  Everyone has passed me.  They all forgot me. 
[03:04:30]  I'm done.  I'm a husband.  It feels like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That's it.  It feels like I'm going to lose everything and be forgotten immediately if I don't do  fucking sets tonight.  Yeah.  Fear of abandonment issues galore with most comics.  Comics?  Come on.  Yep.  Stop.  Never.  That's it.  And radio.  We should just have like a code where we all just hug each other at the door.  Just like, I know.  I know.  We really should be hugging each other.  Through a lot more than we do.  Through all the angst and insecurity.  You need it.  I need it.  Me too.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:05:00]  When you're doing arenas and stuff like that, I remember Dice after he stopped doing arenas.  Like he was still doing 5,000 seats, sometimes 9,000, but it felt like he was obsessed with  getting back into the arenas.  Yes.  Now I know you could still do them, but if you do a market where you did an arena and then  you come back and it's like, ah man, we just did 6,000 instead of 15,000.  Do you become obsessed with getting back into the arena or are you like, Jesus Christ, 6,000 people  is an amazing place to level off at?  Fortunately, I don't feel like it has to be an arena, but it's like the level of how 
[03:05:30]  I worked on my show to get it to that point.  It's like I can't even go into the club or I couldn't.  I was even going into the factory like, I used to enjoy 10 people.  I could just enjoy getting up there, but because I'm coming in and just hanging, I need to be  okay that they're going to look at me and just be like, oh, this is just not, this is okay.  This isn't the arena show that everyone's paying this much money for.  And now I was starting to like, that was, you shouldn't be thinking this.  It's like thinking of who's at the back of the room watching you. 
[03:06:00]  Once you leave your body, you're done.  Me and Jimmy have talked about a shitload of it.  But when we saw you in Boston at the old Boston Garden and you fucking killed it.  And then we walk out and they're lined up for a second show.  Me and Jimmy looked at each other like, holy fuck.  We couldn't even just, it was just an amazing fucking feat.  People don't understand that, I don't think, sometimes.  You fucking had them lining up for a second show at the Boston Garden.  That's rockstar.  And how many people was it? 
[03:06:30]  18, 19,000.  18, 19,000.  Most people would love to do that once.  He did it twice in one night.  I'd be happy to do that over the course of six months.  Spread out in 14 cities.  We couldn't get out of there because everyone was waiting to get in for the second show.  We were like, it was just you and a stool.  What the fuck?  Yeah, it really was.  And I know Kellner shot it, right?  Which was Marty Kellner, I think, directed it.  Which was such a great shot.  Because he did the Stones.  He did Carlin.  Yeah.  And it was like, that shot. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, it was fucking great, man.  And it was like, that was what an arena show should look like.  Absolutely.  And some comics could work in arena.  You worked in arena well.  I mean, it was like, it just looked like it belonged.  It didn't look out of place.  No, you owned it.  I went to Marty Kellner because I saw Carlin live in Arizona, 77.  And Kellner directed it.  And it was Carlin's first in the round show.  Was this the Celebrity Theater?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And I remember seeing that years and years ago and feeling like, oh, that's.  And then I saw Carlin at the South Shore music tent years back in Mass. 
[03:07:30]  And that's like 2000 in the round.  And then I, that was my first in the round show.  I played there in like 97.  I was like, if I could ever do a big arena show, I'd do in the round.  Yeah.  And that was great to do with Marty.  So that night was.  Fucking Carlin.  That was amazing, man.  We were fortunate enough to have him do our show at the end of his life a bunch of times.  Yeah.  I remember seeing him with you on.  Tough crowd.  Yeah.  You guys were like.  Did a sketch.  I hope that's a photo somewhere in your own.  Because I remember just being like, Norton must be so psyched right now. 
[03:08:00]  He was loving you, man.  I have a photo on my, on my, on my fucking, when you walk in, it's me and Carlin.  He's dressed like a priest.  I'm dressed like a, an altar boy.  And I got him to sign it.  He wrote, you know, George Carlin.  And then he wrote, I think SJ.  And someone told me that's Society of Jesuits is what it means.  Like he signed it like a priest.  So it was a great.  Oh, there it is.  Look at that picture.  Remember that?  Oh, man.  That's fucking classic.  That is classic.  That's rich.  Yeah.  That's a fucking great shot.  That's great.  Great shot.  Answers to nothing.  Yeah.  People really should check out this movie. 
[03:08:30]  Uh, I like the, uh, the brother, sister fucking story.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, rough.  Yeah.  And, and saw it after, you know, Patrice.  Yeah.  No, it's a, listen, it's a provocative movie.  It's the kind of movie that, you know, you leave and you want to, you want to talk about  it.  You know, I like movies like that.  You want to dissect it.  Yes.  You know, you know, somebody in it, something about yourself is reflected in it.  So it was, uh, I was psyched that the director sought me out for it.  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[03:09:00]  I always think it's funny too, and you, cause everybody's talking about Patrice and tweeting  about him.  And I understand, it's a lot of love for a guy who deserves it and is funny enough to  deserve it.  But it's funny to me.  Like, it's like, do you know how many of you, and I don't mean the fans, I mean the  performers.  Do you know how many of you he had no respect for?  Do you know?  We know.  How little he respected you?  Oh, shit.  What shit he thought you were.  I think we can all pick out a few names.  Is that how he would have dominated you in a room and just dismissed you and scrunched 
[03:09:30]  his, the Patrice scrunch?  Oh, it's awful to get that face.  Do you think he would like all this attention?  Yes and no.  He would be annoyed by some of it, but he was not so, he was so intuitive.  He would have appreciated it too.  He was not a dumb guy.  He would have known that that love was an impressive show from people.  And he was not unmoved, unmovable by stuff like that.  Like, when he knew people loved him, or when you showed him, he was like, oh, wow, thanks,  man.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate that.  Like, he was defensive. 
[03:10:00]  Probably a lot of that was him being defensive.  Like, he didn't know people would love him as much as they did.  And I think that was like, when you showed him affection, or like, like Jonathan said that,  because Jonathan managed Patrice as well.  And he said that when I went to see part of his special taped at, in, fell off in the  room.  Yeah.  And I stayed for a few minutes, because I had to set, and I didn't see Patrice, because  he was already on stage.  And Jonathan told him that Norton came.  He's like, really?  Yeah.  Like, he was surprised that I'd come by.  I was like, no, of course.  He was, he forgot sometimes that, yeah, people like you, stupid. 
[03:10:30]  We have friends.  I absolutely.  You were there, Opie.  I have a similar story.  I went back to see him and his mom, and he's like, what are you doing here?  I'm like, what are you talking about?  There's a big deal for you.  And I feel like we're friends, and I want to come here and support.  Yeah, I meant a lot to you.  Yeah, well, fuck.  Yeah, but I'm trying to make me cry more.  No, but I think that's what, it's funny to me, how much he would be annoyed by some  of these people, but he would appreciate it overall.  But I guess what we're trying to say is, when he did drop his guard, it was awesome.  It was fun.  Because it didn't happen a lot.  We, you know, myself, Bobby, Bill Burr, there was a gang of us. 
[03:11:00]  Like, he, you know, Patrice is in my graduating class.  You know, we started together, but I will always remember sitting at, there was a place across  the street from Nixon in Boston.  It was like an old, before it was Bennigan's, but then Bennigan's.  And we'd hang there, and it was like still at a time where, you know, we all would be  really helping each other out with our sets.  And that was a time when, you know, to see Patrice becoming what he was and forming that 
[03:11:30]  persona and the attitude that, I wouldn't even say the attitude, but like, the first one  to be like, what I am now, I'm going to bring that to the stage, as opposed to like some  of you guys that are up there just trying to, you know, do shtick.  Like, and, uh, and I, I, to be thinking about those conversations, which I'd forgotten about  of him being like questioning, like, yeah, do you think that, that I should be saying  that I should be talking about, I think I should drop that Malcolm X XL thing.  Maybe like that's, and to see him at a point where he was extremely kind of, again, vulnerable 
[03:12:00]  and open, um, it made me realize.  And, you know, you see those moments with other people, you know, we, we always joked about  like he, he could be such a kind of a bully, like, you know, the way he could seemingly  push anybody out with the, the, the stare, but we remember a Patrice that was, you know,  uh, you know, wanted to grow as a performer, you know, he wouldn't have been there if he  didn't.  And, uh, that's what I remember a lot is the encouragement we all gave each other at the, 
[03:12:30]  at that early and the people that probably quit because Patrice was like, no, man, you shouldn't  be, you shouldn't be here.  Oh, favors.  Yeah.  Jonathan, you got anything?  Oh, sorry, Dane.  I didn't, I thought you were done.  I was going to say, no, he escorted, I'm sure a lot of people out the comedy this way.  There were a lot of people on the fence.  Yeah.  And I think what he would do is just shake the fence and you'd fall off on the other  side.  Nobody ever fell on, he never shook the fence and had somebody fall in front of him.  It was always on the opposite side. 
[03:13:00]  On the not comic side.  Try to hold on, man.  I saw him stop a show because of a heckler who kept, it was in Chicago and Hannibal Buress  had opened for him and, and, um, this guy would not stop heckling Hannibal.  And then Patrice got on stage and the guy tried saying something to Patrice and that  was it.  He stopped the show and he goes, okay, I'm going to give you your time now.  Oh, shit.  Come on up.  And the guy got so embarrassed and he just eviscerated him. 
[03:13:30]  And, uh, you know, because he, he had the respect for the other comics and, you know,  he, he was not one to, you know, it's funny when you were talking about earlier about,  um, people that he didn't like, there's a guy that was tweeting yesterday who I know  for a fact, Patrice hated this guy.  And the guy tweeted something like, I'm devastated at the loss of Patrice O'Neal.  He is a complicated and difficult guy at times, but a genius artist.  And I'm like, he hated, and I mean, hated, hated this guy with a passion, like just hated 
[03:14:00]  him.  And to see this guy tweeting and, uh, give, give Jonathan a pen.  I need to know.  Guy trying to fucking, uh, guy trying to open his heart, but you know, it's a phony.  Cause if he fucking, if he really was felt the way he felt, he wouldn't have fucked  Patrice to begin with.  Yeah.  He tried.  I mean, I, I can go into great detail.  He tried to fuck him over so hard on this deal and it was horrible.  And we caught him in the middle of it and it was just awful.  And he hated him.  Did Patrice call him on it?  Oh yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  He called him on it in the room.  Oh yeah.  That's, that's Patrice.  The executives got scared cause they'd never seen him act that way.  And this guy was shaking cause he got in front of him.  He got in front of his face and he's like, you liar.  You liar.  You lied to me.  You know, you revealed yourself.  He loved that word.  You revealed yourself to me.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  And just to see this guy tweeting this yesterday was, uh, vomit bag.  Yeah.  But I think so.  I think he would have loved, I think he would have appreciated the love. 
[03:15:00]  He was certainly, he was an emotional guy.  He was a sensitive, he was an animal lover.  Like dumb dogs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's something that really is amazing.  When you just saw his, his sheer size and stuff, you'd be like, Hey, it's big, it's  a big black guy.  Yeah.  And then he's like that one picture of him holding the kitten up and he's making like  googly eyes at this little kitten in his, his giant hand.  It's fucking classic.  It's like of mice and men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't pet it.  Don't pet it.  Motherfucker.  That would have been a great reboot. 
[03:15:30]  But that's so Patrice right there.  Except he wouldn't have accidentally killed the girl.  He just would have talked to her until she killed herself.  Who would have told her why she was a worthless hoe.  Yeah.  He loved his dog and everything.  It's just like he's fucking.  And his dog is like a small white little puppy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  That's great.  Yeah.  And he was going to do something for PETA too, right?  Yeah.  He was about to do this PSA for PETA.  And, you know, we had it scheduled and everything.  And everything was hitting on all cylinders. 
[03:16:00]  He was ready to fucking.  Yeah.  I was going to say like, obviously for fans and just, you know, what, what's in  the.  He's got an album that we're going to release.  Well, the pre-orders are going to start very soon.  It's called Mr.  P.  It's, it's, it's hard to listen to right now for, for me.  I mean, it's just, it's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  He recorded it in DC at the improv.  Different stuff from Elephant.  It's all new stuff.  It's.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I didn't know it was new from Elephant.  It's all new material.  That's what's amazing about it.  And it's good.  I mean, really, really good. 
[03:16:30]  I think we're getting you guys some stuff.  Iraq's saying we got the track.  Can we play it to end the show today, E?  Do we have a track from Mr. P?  Yeah.  It's the one Jonathan suggested.  Okay.  Oh yeah.  We play this today.  Hell yeah.  So this is going to be one of the tracks off the new album that people  could pre-order real soon.  Yeah.  I mean, we'll give out all the information when you can get it.  I didn't know that.  We got people to take care of, man.  Write anything?  Was he writing anything?  He was writing something.  He also had a movie that he did.  It's funny.  He like, he did the movie with Jimmy, Furry Vengeance. 
[03:17:00]  Yes.  He was, he was difficult at best on that side.  I was telling him yesterday, I was like the codependent wife trying to explain it like  he's just tired.  Oh, was he fucking miserable when we did that movie.  It was the only time I ever had a casting director call me like after someone had been  put in the movie and they were shooting and they're like, look, he's got to stop talking  to the director.  Oh no.  Oh no.  Oh no.  What happened?  And then he was really upset that the guy took it the wrong way.  He was just, you know, they had one day where they were just waiting and waiting. 
[03:17:30]  It was the first day.  We hadn't met the director.  We were sitting in the honey wagons for hours and you know, two, two fucking assholes commiserating.  Like I would look at his like, what the fuck?  He's like, you know, and both by the time we got down to the set, a full fucking head  of steam.  Yeah.  But I was just happy to be there.  And he made a really like sarcastic comment to the guy.  Oh no.  You know, it was real passive.  He was like, how you doing buddy?  Whoa.  What's going on?  We're sitting around.  I don't remember what exactly what it was, but it was something like that.  And they called and they're like, he can't talk to the director anymore, uh, unless he's 
[03:18:00]  spoken.  Wow.  Oh, you know what?  You know, it's a testament to Patrice.  Cause you talk about that movie a lot.  Jimmy is, uh, the fact that he got along with Brooke Shields.  She loved him.  Yeah.  It was her movie.  It was her movie.  He didn't want to be there.  You guys were miserable.  He obviously had a problem with the director, whatever.  But in the end, Brooke Shields loved him.  And he liked her too.  Yeah.  Cause she came in here and she was like, Patrice, you know, she was just.  Uh, he was, uh, sitting something.  She was going to her trailer to eat lunch. 
[03:18:30]  And he said, why you don't want to eat lunch with us?  Like, you know?  And so she said, Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And then I guess she did.  And she sat with you guys and ate lunch.  And yeah, there's a, there's that great photo of him and really hit it off.  Yeah.  There's a, I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no.  It's him and Brooke.  She's got her fucking muscles and Patrice is kind of standing there.  Oh, I got a video.  I got a show too.  I think I played the audio.  It's from one of those scenes where there was a bit, a hill and Patrice was dressed  a construction worker and he has to walk down the hill, but he slips in the mud and he 
[03:19:00]  crashes into the camera.  And it's not that long of a video, but he just kind of, he just kind of fucking slips  into it.  And I watched it on a monitor and I fucking watching this dummy slip into the fucking  camera.  Oh, by the way, Mr. P is available for pre-order on iTunes now.  So go to iTunes now and pre-order.  And Amazon.  I'll say it again.  Take care of.  Yeah.  His family.  We got people to take care of.  All the money is going to go to them.  We set it up. 
[03:19:30]  It's the DVD guys.  The CD people are doing the right thing.  They actually restructured things just so Patrice's family would get more money.  Literally after this whole thing happened, you know, we didn't know what was going to  happen.  And they just said, look, we're going to change our deal.  And they did something unbelievably generous.  Wow.  So, uh, yeah, that's great.  It's really going to, you know, cause that was one thing he cared about taking care of  people.  Like he really, you know, his mom, Vaughn, his stepdaughter.  I mean, uh, uh, I had dinner with, uh, uh, Vaughn and, uh, his stepdaughter and, uh,  you know, it's, it's hard for them now. 
[03:20:00]  I mean, especially, uh, his stepdaughter, she's just, but it's funny.  I mean, I think they were together like 10 years.  And so she's 11 and I just didn't realize the effect he had on her.  Cause her personality is really, it's amazing.  And it's funny.  And she's like questioning me about stuff, you know?  And, you know, you don't get that from 11 year olds.  Yeah.  And, uh, it's amazing.  I mean, you're in the middle of something and she went, shut up.  He's got, he's, he's also got this movie coming out, uh, called scout masters. 
[03:20:30]  And he was really, he, it's funny other than complaining about the parking situation  on it every day.  Uh, yeah, he actually loved doing the movie.  Uh, man.  Rob Riegel, right?  Yeah.  And the funny thing is he'd be like, yeah, they're cool.  I like Rob and everything.  I mean, this parking situation, we got to deal with this.  And cause I got it in his deal that they would pay for his parking.  And you know, he was happy with that.  And cause he wanted to drive his truck and he didn't want to be picked up and drive 
[03:21:00]  my truck.  And you know, so, okay, I got you parking.  Well, what they did was they, they were shooting the movie in like Westchester.  So he didn't, he realized he didn't want to drive to the set.  He wanted to drive into Manhattan where like Rob Riegel and Ian go in the van with him.  So he had to park his car in the city and they were like, well, no, we, we, in the deal,  his contract was to pay for parking at the set, not in the city.  So every day, every single day, he was like, man, this $24 is pissing me off every day. 
[03:21:30]  And I'd be like, yeah, but you're having a good time filming.  Yeah, that's cool.  That's cool.  But this fucking parking situation, we got to work on it.  He just, you know, but he, he liked filming that movie.  He liked Riegel a lot.  They had a good time together.  Is there a buzz on the movie?  I don't.  Yeah.  From what I hear, I mean, again, you know, the producers and, and, and this guy,  Todd Rohall, the director has told me he's got like the funniest scene in the movie.  And, uh, he had a really good time in this movie.  Uh, it's funny.  Cause he, he, you know, I know that.  Cause he said to me, he goes, I think this could be funny.  I think this could be pretty good. 
[03:22:00]  Like for him.  I was like, right.  Cause free vengeance.  He goes, man, this is a piece of garbage.  This is just, you know, I was just, I was just remembering.  I'm sure, you know, Jimmy, you saw this so many times you, you could pretty much walking  in, walking into whatever situation you were, where Patrice was waiting.  You could almost quickly assess the level of whatever he was dealing with frustration  or by how he was wearing his hat.  Oh shit. 
[03:22:30]  Yes.  Depending on where the hat was placed on his head, you knew that you were in for it with  Patrice.  If it was, if it was kind of like back and like kind of floppy, it was feeling jovial.  If it was that half down over one eye, it was like, here we go.  He's got a gripe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That hat was a mood hat.  It was lovely.  I love that.  I saw him move it a few times too.  Sure.  Cause his mood was changing.  He's being jovial hat and then pull it down a little bit.  Oh shit.  When we did the, when we did elephant in the room, we had a big discussion cause he goes, 
[03:23:00]  I I've graduated from baseball hat to like a fedora now.  And he didn't want to wear a baseball hat.  And we were worried because it was covering his face.  You know, the shadow would be cast over his face a little bit.  Big argument about it, but he just, he didn't care.  He'd be like, no.  And then you'd see him wear it different, different styles throughout.  You know, it's so true to try to see what would show his face.  Yeah.  But he would also the mood.  I mean, that's literally, you nailed it.  Yeah.  The wool ones.  I remember it come down.  If it was right. 
[03:23:30]  If it was right on his brow.  If he was leaning back in a chair.  If it was right to where you could barely see his eyes.  It was like, I didn't watch the news today, but I'm going to, I'm going to know in a few  minutes what's happening.  Did you see this motherfucker putting sandbags?  Did you ever hear him?  I said it to you in the elevator when we were coming up.  He hated the movie, The Town.  Because he was like, man, I grew up in Boston.  This is not Boston. 
[03:24:00]  And I'm like, well, it's not your Boston.  He goes, fuck man.  This is the only Boston people are going to know.  He was really pissed about it.  Yeah.  He was like, he had this, this thing, but he's like, there's other people from Boston.  Dane's from Boston.  This is not his Boston either.  And I went, all right.  You know, I, I liked the movie.  What can I say?  He made me feel really bad for liking.  For liking a movie.  Made me feel really awful for liking it.  Yeah.  I liked the movie.  Yeah.  He did not.  He hated it.  Nobody ever wondered, like, I wonder what Patrice thinks of me. 
[03:24:30]  Like, no one has ever said those words.  No.  Like, you knew immediately how he felt about you.  Yeah.  Like, that's the beauty of him is that you could never, he was a bad, I'm sure he had  to do poker face once in a while.  Barely.  But he was terrible at hiding that stuff.  Barely.  Barely.  Yeah.  He was terrible at hiding dislike or displeasure or lack of respect.  He was a horrible poker player.  He didn't fucking hide it, man.  Yeah.  He, he, sometimes he just loved saying it.  Like, there was, I remember when I broke up, I broke up with my chick and, and, uh, 
[03:25:00]  he was like, yo, you broke up with that girl you were with?  I'm like, yeah, yeah.  He goes, oh, so I, I don't have to be nice to her anymore?  Oh.  What?  Yeah, he had, he had a great sigh.  Patrice's sigh was wonderfully like, what?  Just let me have it.  Uh, fuck.  My favorite thing he did on one of them was when he would shush people.  Did you ever hear him shush people?  Oh, yeah.  He would.  Oh, yes.  It's so loud.  Literally.  Shhh. 
[03:25:30]  Those big fucking teeth.  He shushed.  He shut, Keith Robinson went to see something at Carnegie Hall with him and he shushed and  fucking literally hundreds of people stopped talking.  Yeah.  He had the ability to just be heard.  Shhh.  But a lot of times he would do it and no one knew where it was coming from.  No, they never knew where they were.  And that was the beauty of it.  They would just turn around and see the lux.  They're looking around like, who the fuck, who the fuck just shushed us?  Dane has to go, he's got TV.  Yeah.  But just so you know, um, uh, oh God, what's the name of the movie?  Answers to Nothing. 
[03:26:00]  Answers to Nothing.  It comes out tomorrow.  You can get it on demand or it's in select theaters.  I'm going to guess New York, LA.  Yeah.  Major cities.  Yeah.  I liked the movie.  I liked it very much.  Check it out.  Or on demand.  That's like the easiest.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm so psyched that I, you know, even though it's a rough week, man, I'm, I was so glad  to be able to come in here and I've been just bottled up wanting to talk about these  things.  I look forward to sitting with you guys again and we'll all remember our, our favorite  Patrice stories that should not be told on the, on the radio. 
[03:26:30]  I have a few of those as well.  Like watching him put his glass dildos back into a fucking, do you know how awful that  was?  Him lugging those clunking fucking glass dildos.  Glass dildos.  But, but I, I, I, I called him out on it.  The Brazilians.  He came in with this briefcase.  He couldn't wait to show us.  And he's like explaining each one.  And then I, I just looked at him like, what are you doing?  Remember?  And he, he had a realization like, yeah, what the fuck am I doing?  Carrying around glass dildos in a briefcase.  We were in a third world country and he's bringing glass dildos into the fucking hole. 
[03:27:00]  Like they're hookers.  You idiot.  What do you don't need to make them come?  He couldn't wait to show us the briefcase.  And I thought it was one of the strangest things I ever saw.  It was a terrible, big Adidas bag.  Yup.  It was so embarrassing.  How many were there?  Seriously.  10?  Maybe 10.  And he would pick them up and you would just hit the picture of the sound of 10  glass things clinking into each other.  And he was explaining each one and what, what it was used for.  And what's up?  Oh, we got it.  Okay.  Dane has to go.  It's a pleasure, man. 
[03:27:30]  Don't be strange.  Always a pleasure.  You can get the movie's Answers to Nothing in theaters tomorrow and on demand.  And you can get Patrice's new CD, Mr. P.  Yes.  Pre-order on iTunes and on Amazon.com.  Now, I didn't realize there was all this stuff.  And a primitive wool emotion cap will be something for charity.  We should get a Patrice doll that you pull a string and it tells you what's wrong with  you.  I think we're going to, oh yeah, Camo someone's mentioning.  Yeah, we got to go though.  And I'll be in Camo with the hookers.  Oh, yeah.  Camo, Camo.  It was so creepy watching him make a hooker come, but he did make her come. 
[03:28:00]  He did make her come.  Jimmy's out tomorrow.  He's got gigs in Baltimore.  I'll be at McGooby's in Baltimore tomorrow, Friday, and Saturday.  And Jonathan, thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks, guys.  I'm bummed we didn't get to your traveling stories.  We did a little, I guess.  But he's in town for a while.  Well, fuck.  Come back next week, then.  Okay.  Please.  We'll do a whole segment.  I want to know where you've been.  What's the name of the track?  This track is called, I Hate People Touching Me.  Perfect.  All right, let's listen to this.  We'll see you tomorrow.  And I don't like people touching me.  I don't think anybody should touch a motherfucker that don't want to be touched.

When you live somewhere and da-da-da.  But I don't like cops touching me.  I'd rather you just, you know, arrest me.  You know, I'm not against the cops.  So, look, you're under arrest.  Cool.  Let me put my hands. 
[03:30:00]  Just don't be checking me.  And I'm going to tell you why I don't like people checking me.  It's because of me.  Person...  You know, I'm getting old.  I'm getting...

Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  I don't want you to protect the world.  There's something under your titty.  We must find it.  I don't want him touching me.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:33:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, it is.  And yes, I am.  I am. It's after Opie and Anthony Live, brought to you by Trojan Bare Skin Condoms.  Trojan, after all, is America's number one most trusted condom brand.  It's very good to see the show kind of start to get back on track today, 
[03:33:30]  starting to, you know, rebuild and get back to where we were.  It's very difficult when you're doing a comedy show,  or even if it's, you know, a general entertainment show,  and you have to deal with the loss of somebody who was so important to that show  to come back and just, you know, pick up like you were the day before  because everything's changed and, you know, overnight, in the blink of an eye, everything's different.  But, you know, we're processing everything, and it's great to see the fans 
[03:34:00]  and hear the audience kind of working through this with us, you know what I mean?  Yesterday's show was just incredible, the amount of people that came in here and showed love for Patrice.  You know, you had, I mean, in hindsight, and they were running it on Raw Dog Comedy all day yesterday.  It was, you know, Louis C.K., you had Bill Burr call in, Rich Voss call in, Joe Rogan call in, 
[03:34:30]  Colin Quinn was in here, Amy Schumer was in here.  I mean, these, like, just A-list comedians that were just coming in  and thanking us for the privilege of getting to do it, which, I mean, it was amazing to see.  And then today, it was great to hear from Big Jay Oakerson, who's been on the show before,  talking about what's going on, and Dane Cook was just great.  I mean, honestly, it was timing, you know.  Dane Cook was going to come in regardless to talk about his movie,  but it was great not only to hear the perspective of Dane, who worked with Patrice so early on, 
[03:35:00]  and to hear Dane's stories about a young Patrice trying to figure out what's going to work on stage  and not sure of himself, just, I mean, amazing to put the guy that we know  as this, you know, huge, larger-than-life personality into that perspective.  And then to also, you know, have somebody on Dane's level honestly be grateful 
[03:35:30]  because this is what he wanted to talk about, you know.  It's got to be difficult for Dane to be going on this press tour like he was talking about for this movie,  which I'm sure he's proud of, but, you know, all they want to do,  all Dane wants to do is talk about the loss of his good friend,  which I'm glad that we provided him that today  and that he provided to us, not only the show, but to the listeners,  the perspective, and we got to see even more of what an effect Patrice had on people. 
[03:36:00]  It's so cool.  I mean, when I found out last night, because an email went around,  but when we found out that there is more Patrice material coming out,  it's so cool.  The album, Mr. P, is Patrice's new stand-up comedy album.  It's a CD. It's not a DVD. Right, Eric?  It's just the CD.  Yeah, it's a CD.  And it's all new material, okay?  It's not—he did Elephant in the Room,  which I thought would be, you know, his final work  and the work that really—this is the hour that represents Patrice. 
[03:36:30]  But to find out that he's got another hour,  and I obviously haven't heard it, but from what Jonathan said,  he said it could be his best.  And to come back after Elephant in the Room,  which just blew everybody's minds,  to come off of Elephant in the Room  and to come up with an hour that's as good, if not better,  is just amazing, but it's not really surprising  when we think about how great Patrice was at this. 
[03:37:00]  So the album is called Mr. P.  You heard a track off of it when the show ended just a minute ago  before the break.  It was called I Hate People Touching Me.  Right. And, you know, I mean, we're not all ready  to dive into Patrice's material.  Everybody's dealing with this stuff differently.  But the album will come out on February 28th.  February—  Right? Isn't it 28th?  February 7th.  Oh, great! Even sooner.  So it'll be out in February.  Early February is when the album officially comes out.  But pre-orders are up now on Amazon and iTunes. 
[03:37:30]  So definitely buy this album.  Like, Jonathan—Jonathan is Jim and Patrice's manager.  He was in here.  He's been on the show before talking about his travels.  Hopefully—we got a little of that with Jason Ellis in here today, too.  Hopefully Jonathan will be back either tomorrow or next week  because his stories are, I mean, unbelievable.  Not only the things that he's seen,  but that anybody would do this,  that anybody would travel to these places,  is beyond my comprehension.  But at the same time, you're talking to a guy 
[03:38:00]  that won't try red meat,  so I'm not exactly an adventurous person.  But definitely buy this Patrice album  because Jonathan told us that the record people  had changed the deal completely after Patrice's passing  and that Patrice's family is going to get so much of this money from the album.  And that's what's really important to support Patrice's family  because, like, I think it was Dane or Jonathan  that said Patrice was a guy who really wanted to take care of people, 
[03:38:30]  and that was something that was really important to him.  Jimmy in Staten Island, you're on after Open Anthony Live.  Sam, last night—because I'm at the show this morning.  I just got in my car.  Yeah.  And last night, I set it up to watch Help in the Room on Comedy Central.  Yeah, it was on.  It was fucking awesome.  And at the end, they did something very, very tasteful, you know,  and respectful.  They put in memory of Patrice, you know.  Yeah.  And I had to hear it yesterday, how we told off everybody to Comedy Central 
[03:39:00]  about Spider-Man City and shit like that.  Yeah.  It was just cool how they just turned around and said, man,  he was awesome.  Value of a white woman, cheating, just shit like that.  Did you watch the Uncensored version that was on later?  Yeah.  That's great.  I stayed up late.  That's awesome.  Well, yeah, and I would definitely—because that's going to be something—  like I said, like that, I mean, we have the album coming out in February,  but that's the last—as far as I know, that'll be the last DVD. 
[03:39:30]  I think that was the last thing that was taped, the last special that was taped.  So I would definitely recommend that, Jimmy, you and everybody go out there  and buy the DVD just so you have it always.  And because, you know, the money from that will go to support the family as well.  Sam, when I used to listen to the show, Patrice was on.  Yeah.  I'd probably have to go.  He'd get me so infuriated, you know.  But the shit he was stealing was pretty hard of point, you know.  That's what I loved about him.  And that's the thing, too.  It's like with entertainers, like a lot of people didn't agree with Patrice. 
[03:40:00]  But the fact is that there was—everybody had an opinion on the guy.  And so many—there are comedians that come in here, and they do their thing,  and they're fine, but you leave.  Yeah, you got to chuckle, but it's very, eh.  They have no effect on you whatsoever.  And that's the worst place that you can be as far as entertaining people.  Just leaving with people not having an opinion on you one way or the other  is the absolute worst place you can be.  And whether you loved Patrice or he infuriated you, 
[03:40:30]  you had an opinion on him.  And, you know, he was in your mind.  Like, he never—you know what I mean?  Yeah, he was awesome.  Yeah.  He was awesome.  I'm going to miss him, man.  I was upset, man.  But I hope in the room,  that made me feel—he's going to be a lot better now.  Yeah, man.  Thanks a lot, Jimmy.  Watch out.  So, yeah, definitely check that out.  And it was cool to hear from Dane Cook.  Dane Cook, I mean, I was thinking about this last night  when I was thinking about how he came up with Patrice and everything. 
[03:41:00]  Like, as big as Dane Cook is and was—  Like, Dane Cook is a superstar.  He's an A-lister.  There's very few people in comedy that have done  and are continuing to do what Dane Cook has done and does.  I mean, like Opie was talking about,  going to see him at the Boston Garden,  playing in front of 19,000 people,  and then when you leave,  having a line of people waiting to see the second show,  two shows back-to-back at the Boston Garden,  that's 40,000 people in one night, 
[03:41:30]  and both are sold out.  Lord knows how many tickets he could have sold if it was unlimited.  But Dane Cook, I mean, it's just so cool that he comes in here.  He talks about Patrice with a genuineness.  He puts Bob Kelly on his show on Tourgasm.  You know, that's where the I Broke My Knee man came from was Tourgasm.  Dane Cook has absolutely not forgotten where he came from.  And, I mean, like you said, he took a year off  and he was just hanging out with family and stuff. 
[03:42:00]  Because a lot of people, you know, they get to that level,  and it's hard to see below you when you're up that high,  if I can use that expression.  That's not an expression.  I just made it up.  It's words that I threw together.  I'm not the most intelligent person.  But, you know, he's not forgotten where he came from,  and it's very cool to see somebody with that perspective on things  that's so in touch with his roots.  What's up, Adam?  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:42:30]  Hey, guys.  I'm just kind of curious.  Like, I got satellite in my work truck,  but I don't have it, you know, outside of work yet.  But the Patrice special you guys are going to do this weekend,  is that something you guys can put on a disc and sell  to raise money for the family?  I don't know what the ownership and stuff is for stuff like that.  I mean, I know that this is going to be more than a special.  We're doing a tribute to Patrice all weekend on this channel.  And this, I mean, it started as just doing, like,  a regular Worst of Special or whatever,  but Worst of the Week countdown that we do is, like, 
[03:43:00]  I think it's a four-hour show that repeats throughout the weekend.  We're blowing everything out this weekend,  and it's going to be all Patrice.  It's not so much a special as we're turning this into a Patrice channel.  Like, when they've turned other stuff here on SiriusXM into pop-up channels,  is what they call them.  Like, Charlie Sheen had a channel for a weekend,  and so-and-so Metallica gets a channel for a week or whatever,  and we're turning this into an all-out Patrice channel. 
[03:43:30]  So it's more than just something.  It would be a box set if we put it out at all,  and I don't know what the ownership issues are with it.  That's the only hang-up.  But in the meantime, I would say just, you know,  anything, I would think anything that Patrice would make a profit on,  so in terms of buying his CDs and DVDs,  because a lot of people are asking,  anything that Patrice would make a profit on,  now that money will go to his family.  So, you know what I mean?  If you want to support his family, pre-order the album. 
[03:44:00]  And it'd be cool.  I'm seeing somebody on Feedback says that Mr. P  is already the number three album on iTunes comedy.  So, I mean, it'd be pretty sweet if we could all, you know,  get that up,  because getting on the top ten of iTunes  is only going to make more people aware of it,  and just get the pre-orders in,  because it's only good for the family.  But if you want to, yeah,  if you want to support the family,  I would definitely say that's the way to do it.  And, you know, listen all weekend,  because we're going to have,  the Patrice Unmasked is going to be part of this.  We're going to have clips from yesterday's show. 
[03:44:30]  We're not airing the full yesterday's show.  Right, Eric?  No, it's just going to, it'll be,  you're going to get the gist of everything that happened yesterday,  but you're going to get some shorter versions  of all the discussions about Patrice from yesterday.  Can you get all his merchandise at his website then, too?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know what he's got for sale on his website right now.  I don't know everything about it,  but yeah, just, you know,  buy Patrice stuff if you want to support,  because we're going to do a ton of Patrice bits. 
[03:45:00]  We're going to throw in bits from yesterday's show.  We're going to have the Patrice Unmasked as part of it.  I mean, every, I would assume.  Black Phillip will be in there.  Yeah, we're going to have clips from the Black Phillip show.  People have been Twittering me about that.  Yes, clips from Patrice doing the Black Phillip show will be in there.  I think we're going to try to squeeze in some clips.  I don't know how many of you remember this,  but when we were doing, when we were on K-Rock and XM,  Patrice came in for two days that Opie and Anthony were off  and did the show by himself. 
[03:45:30]  He hosted the Opie and Anthony show on his own.  We're going to, I think we're going to throw in some bits from that.  We're going to have, I mean, everything, you know,  the full, full bits, the full thing of,  of, of Rock Code and Calmo and the Glass Dildos  and the Independence Day Review.  And, I mean, I'm not speaking of Dinosaur Forest.  Dinosaur Forest, everything.  What about Cheetah Heels?  You've got to do the Cheetah Heels.  Cheetah Heels, Eric?  Uh, that's, yeah, that's in there too.  I mean, I'm telling you, this thing, it's not like, 
[03:46:00]  you're not going to be able to sit down and listen to the full special.  That's how long it is.  I mean, we're not even, we don't even know what the length is,  but I'm, without exaggeration, okay, over 12 hours of material.  Awesome.  What you guys are doing is amazing.  So, awesome show yesterday and today.  Thanks a lot, Adam.  Yeah.  Yeah, so it's, it's cool.  And we're, you know, somebody's, uh, you know,  people are, are calling in and stuff with bits and everything that they want to hear.  I mean, every, everything you can think of. 
[03:46:30]  Look, uh, for, because I saw it on Twitter too and everything.  I put up something on the Facebook yesterday, uh, facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  If there's, uh, something that maybe that fell through the cracks that we're not thinking of,  you know, you can, there's a column up there so you can give us your suggestions.  But as far as all the major stuff that everyone's been requesting and the stuff that we reference  all the time, it's already included.  So you don't have to worry about it.  It's all there.  The thing about Patrice is that he was so good on this show that like yesterday or two days 
[03:47:00]  ago, when it came time to finding all the Patrice bits so that we could have something  like this ready to go, it took no time because usually we'll have to go back into shows and  find bits and, and isolate them so we can make a proper tribute or whatever.  But every, almost, almost everything that Patrice did in this studio, the day of, we isolated  it for Worst Of and immediately put it into the Worst Of library.  There was no obscure material from Patrice.  Right.  Everything, every time he was here, it's like, well, that segment's Worst Of, that segment's 
[03:47:30]  Worst Of.  And, and this is the difference between Patrice and other people that like other people,  you're like, yeah, we really should do a tribute or yeah, we should try to throw something  together, blah, blah, blah.  I mean, we've got so, we could do a week on Patrice and, and without even trying.  All right.  We're not, we don't have to dig through stuff to find it.  It's all there.  I mean, we would have, we would have wanted to run this, uh, Patrice channel takeover regardless. 
[03:48:00]  The fact that there's a reason now, you know, it's, it's a horrible reason, but I'm, I'm  glad that we get to run it.  I'll be tuned into the radio all weekend.  Uh, and I wanted to give you, you know, before, while, while we're still doing Patrice stuff,  I want to talk about a couple other things.  Cause I, you know, like I said, we want to keep moving past this as much as, you know,  all of it, it's at the front of our minds.  Um, we want to keep moving on, but I did want to play for everybody, uh, a little taste 
[03:48:30]  of Patrice and the Gallagher confrontation.  Cause I love this moment because it really was, Patrice wasn't a guy who would sit next  to you, have a problem with you and you wouldn't know it.  Like Gallagher was in here and Patrice was in here and Patrice wanted to address something  with Gallagher that would have been uncomfortable for anyone else.  And it made the entire room uncomfortable, but for Patrice, that was what was honest.  That was what was truly going on. 
[03:49:00]  And so he said, this is what we're going to do.  We're going to go here.  This is what, this is what I want to talk about.  And this is when, uh, he, he accused Gallagher of racism, correct?  Iraq.  Uh, he accused Leo and he, and he, and he refused, he refused to go with this gimmick and  call him Gallagher.  It's the last time Gallagher was on our show.  We had started to build up a little bit of a relationship between this show and Gallagher.  Um, well he had come in, I think this was like his third appearance.  Well, what happened was this appearance, Gallagher came in two days, uh, no, not two days in 
[03:49:30]  a row, but two days that week.  The first day he was in, we had this whole studio set up like a kill room with plastic  so he could smash stuff.  Then he was going to come back two days later and that was the day Patrice was here and  we've never seen Gallagher again.  Never again.  As a matter of fact, uh, after Gallagher had heart problems or whatever it was, I don't  remember.  Roland, uh, called him like a week later and he was shopping in a Walmart in Walmart and  uh, Roland goes, Hey Gallagher, the guys want to talk to you. 
[03:50:00]  And in the middle of shopping at Walmart, Gallagher screams, you guys are going to kill me.  You have to leave me alone because of what, because I think, and that's the thing.  Cause guys like Gallagher are real to an extent.  They, they're telling you the truth to an extent, but they're keeping themselves protected.  They're not being completely revealing.  Don't question them on it.  Yeah.  And they're not being completely revealing and they don't want to be questioned on what 
[03:50:30]  they're not revealing.  This is something that would not fly for Patrice.  Gallagher's big worry was that he was going to, and he said this in one of the interviews  that you'll never get booked at County and state fairs by talking that way.  Yeah.  And, and he was concerned that Patrice kept calling him Leo.  It really was.  I mean, it was an awesome thing.  This was even, it was a big secret.  This is, I remember a month ago I had to share, I was on who kids show and I had to share this  entire thing that happened cause carrot top was in and we all know about the, uh, the Gallagher 
[03:51:00]  carrot top prop comic war.  Gallagher believes that any prop comic has stolen Gallagher's gimmick.  So I explained this whole thing to carrot top.  I mean, it's just one of those stories that just sticks with you.  So here it is.  It's just a taste and the full thing, the full confrontation will be part of our Patrice  weekend tribute.  It's such an obscure bit.  Yeah.  Completely obscure.  No one ever thinks of this.  It's Patrice and Gallagher. 
[03:51:30]  He, or Leo, as he called him here on after open Anthony live.  After O and A live.  Hold on.  Let's get into this.  Gallagher feels like he has to make a statement.  I think he doesn't like us.  I don't think he's coming back.  Nigger farts are, uh, contributing to global warming.  Jesus, Patrice.  Gallagher's going to explain.  Black people have more gas than most.  Let Gallagher explain.  He felt like he was in a spot.  From his diet.  Why?  Here's a fart.  All those pork chops are stinking up to earth.  Right, Gallagher?  Leo.  I do a fart joke. 
[03:52:00]  I do a fart joke, but I do a different one.  Why don't little girls...  How many of us take...  Hold on.  Let him do a fart joke.  I want to know how many light bulbs...  How many of me's it takes to screw in a fucking light bulb?  Let him do his fart joke.  All right, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I'm trying to get back on his good side, because he fucking is giving me the daggers right  now.  Go ahead, Gallagher.  Why don't little girls fart?  Because they don't get assholes until they get married.  Now, this gets all the girls in the audience.  Yeah, the girls love that, right? 
[03:52:30]  Yes, they do.  And the guys are like...  That's a good fart joke, instead of just saying what you said.  How about this...  Wait, but how about this joke about girls?  Yeah.  My girlfriend has been with me for eight years.  I've been with her for three.  Gallagher?  He's thinking...  How's that one?  I guess that's what black people do.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Told you.  No.  He's mad at me because I asked a question.  I like it.  I think his real name is Gala Nigger. 
[03:53:00]  No, I like this Gala Nigger.  Gallagher's mad at me.  This is the true Leo.  But he's mad at me because I asked that question before break.  He's actually mad.  Here's why he's upset.  Because he knows...  Let him talk about it.  Fuck that.  He is the Hulk, and you brought in the thing that makes him change.  He's a wolf, man, and you brought a full moon in.  Well, he said my mom fucked a Viking.  Well, imagine what he thinks my mom fucked. 
[03:53:30]  At least it has king in it.  Yours is mine.  Jesus Christ.  Yours has king in it, too.  Yours has...  All right, listen.  Oh, my God.  I don't want Gallagher leaving and never coming back.  So, Gallagher, why was that question bad?  Well, I guess you'll have either an Oriental or a gay comic on next time, and I'll have 
[03:54:00]  to deal with that.  Oh, shit.  We talk race all the time in the show.  We do.  We do talk a lot about race.  I didn't know.  I was on two days ago, and we didn't discuss it.  No, because it's not an everyday thing.  But we kind of just...  We're all over the place.  But it's...  Race only comes up every other day.  It's whatever...  It's a very kind of...  For real?  Whatever the world is talking about thing.  And in this day and age, political correctness is, like, really a big thing.  And we talk about that.  We talk about sex.  We talk about toilet habits.  We'll talk about anything. 
[03:54:30]  But race is kind of a big thing, especially in this day and age with Obama being president.  It was a big issue.  There was a report, a little story about Jimmy the Greek on during the football.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We just played this clip.  We did Jimmy the Greek.  Did you flick around?  I was interested in what the networks played against that game, trying to get attention.  Because they did the Bourne, whatever it is, Odyssey or whatever.  Yeah, there's like three or four of them.  Bourne Identity.  They did that.  I love that movie.  I watch it every time. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I watched that and the football game.  It was kind of a pitiful game.  I didn't watch the football game, no.  Well, I wanted to know who won.  I like crime shows.  I saw him get hit in the back, but it didn't look like it hurt him that bad.  His arm went to sleep.  It had to hurt, though, right?  No, it was just a little hit.  It was just a little hit.  But I guess they put him out.  They could have had that as a strategy.  We're not going to come back from what happened before the break, huh?  I was just looking at Sam's hair.  Yeah, Sam's hair, by the way.  Sam's hair now. 
[03:55:30]  The bit's over and we got nothing accomplished.  It's a cross between Frederick Douglass.  It actually looks like Adolf Hitler.  It does.  A little, but.  Yeah, hey, there you go.  Oh, shit.  Really?  No blacks or Jews at my show.  Oh, no.  You do have a very specific demographic to your audience.  I've noticed that, too.  Yeah, smart.  Oh, okay.  That's one way to put it. 
[03:56:00]  Patrice isn't talking anymore.  It is funny watching the guys with the dry look from Gillette hair and the big 70s porno  mustaches and stuff.  I think it's interesting to look at the audience when you go there and go, wow.  People come up to me and they say, we were stoned when we watched your show.  And I said, I was, too.  And that's where the jokes came from.  If your knee's bent the other way, what would a chair look like?  What makes Teflon stick to the pan?  So no more French people at your shows now?  No more French words in my mouth.  You can't go out to eat without speaking French. 
[03:56:30]  There's a restaurant, a buffet, a cafe, a cabaret.  There's a valet.  There's a maitre d'.  You can order a la carte or get the soup du jour.  I start every day with a latte and a croissant, and I don't like it.  That's a Carlin thing right there.  It's French.  Good stuff.  It's an observation.  That's why I said Carlin.  He was the king of the observation.  Well, people don't realize that...  About Africa.  There's...  Oh, wow.  I'm just asking about Africa.  You asked about China and fucking France.  I'm just saying.  It's a continent, not a country.  That's right.  How about fucking Nigeria? 
[03:57:00]  Oh, we all hate that place.  What's their major export?  I hate Nigeria, too.  Scams?  And the emails about how they've got some money they need to get out of the bank, and  can you help them?  That's what I just said!  Why are you getting mad?  I don't know.  I guess it wasn't clear.  It wasn't clear.  All right.  How are we going to get everyone on the same page again, Gallagher?  We're on the same page.  If Gallagher just stop his racism for four seconds, we can love each other.  Now, Gallagher, that was amazing.  Oh, shit.  Giving you a...  I've never seen a look like that. 
[03:57:30]  After ONA Live.  He was just a genius.  I mean, nothing funnier.  It's Sam Robertson after Opie and Anthony Live.  There's no...  I was laughing in here, and I was in the room when it happened.  The tension that he caused, and just bathing in it.  Did you hear him just laughing off mic the whole time?  Gallagher was furious at this whole thing, but you know what?  It's probably because Gallagher was a bit of a racist.  Patrice is... 
[03:58:00]  It's the only thing I want to talk...  It's the only thing I want to talk about, but I also...  Ugh.  I don't want to seg into it, but...  I also have to talk about Argentium.  I guess you all know that, don't you?  Argentium.  What is Argentium?  Does anybody know?  Of course.  Everybody knows at this point.  We've been talking about it for a month.  Argentium is Steven Singer's new super silver collection.  That's right.  Steven Singer's brand new collection of silver is made from Argentium, the king of all silver metals.  Look.  Get the Argent...  What was that?  Wrong one.  Sorry. 
[03:58:30]  Steven Singer's going to be really mad.  That was Eric the Sexman Nagel, Steven Singer.  He's trying to wrap me up with the Super Mario music.  Steven Singer is no video game character.  He's a super man.  He's a man of steel.  He's a man of silver.  He's a man of Argentium.  Check out the Argentium collection now.  It's over at IHateStevenSinger.com.  You can visit him in person.  I always do.  On the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  Listen, Jason Ellis was making fun of me earlier on the show for getting married.  Well, let me tell you. 
[03:59:00]  I got my engagement ring from Steven Singer and wedding bands for Sam Roberts and Jessica  are on their way to my house from Steven Singer.  We talked on the show about how little money I have.  I'm a fucking dishwasher for God's sake.  If I can afford Steven Singer and get something nice from him, if he can make it happen for  me, he can make it happen for you.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com or you can order by phone at 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER. 
[03:59:30]  The other corner, not that corner, the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  That's IHateStevenSinger and IHateStevenSinger.com.  Eric, you said in my ear today when Jason Ellis was on the show that you thought his remarks  about me not being the wealthiest of persons was unnecessary.  Yeah, well, it's kind of like what you do to me and anybody else where you just throw 
[04:00:00]  some really unnecessary, hurtful comment out just because, you know, hey, things are  flying around.  I'll throw it out there and see what sticks.  He's right, though.  Ellis was right.  You are a piece of shit dishwasher, yes.  No, he didn't say piece of shit, did he?  Yeah, I think so.  Well, if you don't have it.  If not, I'm embellishing.  Okay, well, that's unnecessary then to me.  But yeah, Ellis was on.  He was talking about it was interesting to have Ellis on.  And I'll tell you why.  Because Jim, we all know and love Jim.  He's talked about his sex addiction on the show forever and just the constant masturbation 
[04:00:30]  and the prostitutes and the drinking of urine and the massages and the this and the that.  Listen, if you were listening to the show, I think it was last week, if it wasn't the  beginning of this, I think it was last week.  If you're listening to the show last week, you know I was sitting in the car driving home  from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania with Jim while he was dirty texting the whole time.  We know he's a sex addict.  What was interesting was Jason Ellis coming in here because Jason Ellis also says that 
[04:01:00]  he is a sex addict, has just recently realized this, though.  He and his wife had broken up.  He said he realizes now he's a sex addict.  So it was very interesting listening to somebody come to terms with this when it's a condition  that we all know very well through Mr. Norton.  When Jim is every day trying to incorporate it into his life, when Ellis said that he was  finally allowed to jerk off, his therapist has said, OK, you can start jerking off again. 
[04:01:30]  All I could think about was how quickly the downfall into into Norton territory will go to the point  where Ellis is jerking off literally six times a day and getting nothing else accomplished.  Who knows what's going to happen with Ellis.  But I think he was trying to inspire people today when he said he was going to go down to the boss's office  when his contract expires and he was going to demand a million dollars.  I mean, and then he had to bring I mean, the fact that Jason Ellis gets to go down and demand a million dollars. 
[04:02:00]  And then you should do that when ONA's contract ends.  Well, here's what I was thinking, because Ellis brought up the fact that I have no money.  Opie decided to bring up the fact that I invited him into my home.  And his observation was that I have two shitty TVs, which is very nice on his part.  But I think I don't think I can demand a million dollars yet.  I don't think I'm on that level.  But I think no, no, you could demand a million dollars.  I could make the demand.  You could.  Yeah.  I mean, what's going to stop me? 
[04:02:30]  I have vocal cords.  Exactly.  There's nothing that would stop me.  But I think realistically.  OK, I'm at the point now where after Opie and Anthony live is bringing in revenue for the company.  Because let me tell you something.  All those times I talk about Argentium, all those times I'm talking about using rubbers and whatnot.  I'm not doing that for free, folks.  What?  That's right.  You're getting paid.  No, that's also incorrect.  But what I'm telling you is this show after Opie and Anthony live. 
[04:03:00]  Is bringing in revenue for Sirius XM.  Oh, that's good.  I've built an audience and continue to build an audience for after Opie and Anthony live.  Ron and Fez intern, don't remember your name.  You don't even have to tell me what it is because I'll only forget it again.  But you have to agree with me on this.  I have built and continue to build an audience for after Opie and Anthony live.  Well, you wrote me in as far as I'm concerned.  I listen to you every day.  Every day I'm not here.  I listen to you.  I click you on every day.  And you used to turn off when we played Worst of, didn't you?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, I was one of those guys. 
[04:03:30]  You know, I was one of those guys.  You've heard it before.  You're either one of those guys or you're not one of those guys.  I was.  And I've heard people come up to me when I go to events where fans are, whether it's  one of our hard rock events or whether I'm going to Eastside Dave's birthday party or  whatever it is, when there are listeners or there are just random people coming up to  me on the street, okay?  I go to the Palisades Mall and every time I'm there, somebody's coming up to me and telling  me something about this show.  And what they're saying is, Sam, I used to listen and turn it right off as soon as I  heard your voice, which, I mean, I don't know why. 
[04:04:00]  I do that.  What do you mean you do that?  I didn't hear a word you said.  I just turned on and you happened to be on.  I need you to listen to the whole show, Eric.  You're supposed to be the producer here.  I'm busy.  You're not busy, okay?  You're just looking at menus.  That's not being busy.  See what I did there?  I hear your water bottle crinkling, you son of a bitch.  Um, but what they tell me is, I used to listen to the show and just turn it off as soon as  I heard your voice, which again, I mean, that's no way to start a conversation, but the point 
[04:04:30]  is, the way the conversation finishes is, now, Sam Roberts, you have me roped in.  Now, I listen to After Hoping Anthony Live.  I wouldn't if it were of a lesser quality.  So you're dealing with a person, Sam Roberts, who now is bringing in money and listeners to  a spot where there otherwise would be no money or listeners.  Am I right, Eric?  Eric!  What?  I wasn't listening.  Come on, dude!  I'm making a point.  You're still on?  I thought we were waiting for Ron and Fez. 
[04:05:00]  No, we're not waiting for Ron and Fez.  We're providing entertainment before Ron and Fez.  So what I'm going to do...  Is provide entertainment?  I've already been doing that, Eric.  I wasn't listening.  I understand that.  Just listen.  Listen.  And you'll hear the entertainment coming through my mouth, into the microphone,  and out all these good people's radios.  I would say out their radios or internets, but the app so rarely works that I'm assuming  everybody's listening on their radios.  Now, what I'm saying is, if Ellis can go down there and say, I want a million dollars to 
[04:05:30]  re-sign with this company.  I don't have a contract to do after Open Anthony Live.  You know this by now.  What I'm going to do is I'm going to go down and I'm going to march right into the boss's  office and I'm going to say, if you want me to do another year of After Open Anthony Live,  I want a contract and I want $1,000.  $1,000, Eric.  A year of After Open Anthony Live and I want a grand. 
[04:06:00]  And who's going to stop me?  Jason Ellis has inspired me to go after what I deserve.  I am going to go into that boss's office and I'm going to demand four figures, one and  three zeros, no decimal places, maybe a comma, depending on how you write it, $1,000.  And I don't think that's too much to ask.  I think I can accomplish it because I was listening to Jason Ellis.  He's going to ask for a million, but let me tell you, Jason Ellis, you might end up with 
[04:06:30]  $999,000, whatever it is, $900,000, whatever, whatever.  I don't know all the math right off the top of my head.  $998,000, whatever.  $1,000 less than a million because $1,000 of that is going to go to me.  Did you hear this, Roland?  I'm putting down the gauntlet.  At some point, I'm going to go and I'm going to demand $1,000 from the bosses.  What do you think?  Make it two.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Live large.  Take two to five. 
[04:07:00]  Two.  $2,000.  Well, you think they shop at JCPenney's for their suits?  You're right.  They got the cash.  Listen, we got to go.  We'll be back tomorrow with more Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live again,  which will be brought to you and is being brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Stay tuned, Roland, because Ron and Fez is coming up next.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
