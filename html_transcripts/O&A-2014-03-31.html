<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment analyzing a cringeworthy 1997 Real Rock TV beach video featuring Opie and Anthony attempting to pick up women.  The hosts, joined by guest Sam Roberts, dissected their own awkward behavior – Opie’s lotion application and Anthony’s clumsy conversation –  and questionable fashion choices, referencing past relationships and a resulting two-week suspension from their show.  The segment included numerous off-color jokes, listener Twitter reactions, and discussion of funnier outtakes, as well as a brief mention of a separate "waterbed" video featuring their former intern, Brian.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of the movie "Noah," its unexpected box office success despite negative reviews, and the hosts' comedic skepticism towards its portrayal of biblical events, particularly its avoidance of explicitly mentioning "God."  They engaged in absurd speculation about the Ark's logistics and the meaning of a "cubit," interspersed with jokes about a news story concerning teenagers smoking coffee and UConn's NCAA tournament chances (mentioning Justin Stangl's perfect bracket). Listener calls followed, including one about a childhood question regarding transvestites and Noah's Ark, leading to discussions about natural selection and various interpretations of the flood story.  The hosts played a Bill Cosby routine about Noah's Ark and a clip from Louis C.K.'s controversial SNL monologue about God, sparking a debate on religious humor and sensitivities.  Further caller interactions covered topics ranging from a caller's daughter's play to personal beliefs about heaven, gender roles, the offensiveness of certain terms like "wife beater," and differing interpretations of biblical stories (contextualist vs. fundamentalist).  The segment concluded with a discussion on the Catholic Church's evolving sense of humor.

The next segment focused on a caller's anecdote about a family member's strict Catholic interpretation of the Bible, leading to a discussion on interpreting biblical texts more like novels than literal instruction manuals, with humorous tangents such as a debate on "blousing" shirts at the beach.  A caller, Greg from Texas, initiated a debate about the relative ease of targeting Christianity versus Islam in comedy, discussing the perceived "niceness" of Christians compared to Muslims.  The conversation touched on the history of violence within Christianity and differing religious sensitivities. The conversation shifted to the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, featuring skeptical comments about the search and ocean debris.  Several callers shared theories and personal experiences, including a medic removing rhino horns in Africa and a Navy veteran discussing ocean trash.  The hosts discussed a picture comparing the Titanic to modern cruise ships and played clips from "Airport" movies.  The segment ended with further discussion of the Malaysian Airlines flight, survivor guilt, and a documentary about plane crash survivors, concluding with a humorous exchange about "catching rays."

The final segment began with a review of a Hulk Hogan Biography Channel documentary, described as slow-paced and depressing, focusing on Hogan’s struggles with depression and suicide.  The hosts used sexually explicit language to describe Brooke Hogan’s appearance.  The discussion shifted to upcoming guests Amy Schumer and Dominic Ansel (the cronut creator).  The hosts discussed Ansel’s cronuts, their popularity, and his apparent lack of business acumen, leading to a lengthy and vulgar digression about donuts, pastries, and imitations, interspersed with frequent, crude sexual references.  A significant portion featured listener calls about donuts, further sexually explicit commentary, and a running gag involving obtaining cronuts from Crumbs bakery, which proved disappointing, resulting in more vulgar comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, let's do this.  Good morning, everyone. Welcome.  Hi, kids.  To another week of radio.  How we doing?  Doing good.  Everyone have a nice relaxing weekend?  Boring weekend.  Boring.  I liked it, though.  Man, did I like doing nothing.  I mean, absolutely nothing. 
[00:00:30]  I don't think I slept in my bed the whole weekend.  I was on the couch.  Lucky you.  On the couch, fell asleep, woke up.  I had no set schedule.  I would wake up at like 11 p.m. on Saturday.  And then I'd watch SNL.  And then I'd watch things until 4 a.m.  And then I'd fall asleep at 4.  I'd wake up at 8.  I'd watch some I Love Lucy.  I'm back asleep.  It was so nice to do nothing. 
[00:01:00]  Get up, play some Call of Duty.  It was just a fun, absolutely alone weekend.  Yeah, I think we were tweeting at the same time yesterday morning.  I think it was.  Yeah.  Because that's my time.  I get up early on the weekends.  But it was just a crappy, rainy day in New York.  It sucked.  It really sucked.  Couldn't go outside.  I mean, this weather, I mean.  Had it.  And I was the one who said, you know, to all the people that are bitching about the weather,  enough already. 
[00:01:30]  But get over it.  It's really been unbelievable.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  This winter is just holding on.  Just won't stop.  It was in the 20s over the weekend.  It's really odd that usually in March, you get something.  You get this inkling where you open up the door, you go, oh, that spring smell.  That's that kind of warm.  You can smell.  Not one fucking day in March.  You can smell the dirt.  Right.  I love smelling the dirt.  Right.  Because it's finally thawing or something.  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  We didn't get one.  I don't understand what that is, but I smell the dirt and know spring is on its way.  I usually look forward to St. Paddy's Day.  Yeah, yeah.  Because then you're like, you know you're on the other side of it.  That's already two weeks ago.  It's still shitty out.  Fucking shitty.  Shitty, rainy, cold, whatevs.  Check out the empties, man.  Check out the empties, man.  By the way, I posted the last video for a while. 
[00:02:30]  I can't do it.  And I got four more.  I just can't do it for a while.  The only thing, I mean, if you found a gay porno with us in it, perhaps that could be  more embarrassing.  I guess.  But this reached an all-time new level.  How could that be more embarrassing?  Man-to-man cogsucking.  We'd all get over that.  There was some funny, I watched that last night, probably six times, and I was quite  enjoying it.  I bet.  And I tweeted about it, and somebody pointed out something I noticed, which was your awful 
[00:03:00]  hand rub on the leg when you rubbed the lotion.  The fact that somebody caught that made me laugh out loud.  I'll take you inside the bit, because someone nailed it.  They said you were rubbing her leg like your girlfriend was watching.  And that's exactly what was happening that day.  I had an incredibly jealous girlfriend at the time.  Oh, yeah.  So we couldn't, I couldn't do any of that shit without hearing, you know, hearing.  And we get to the beach to do this bit, and she's there, and I'm like, how the fuck am 
[00:03:30]  I going to pull this off in front of her?  So you got to rub lotion on her, and she's like steaming, listening to it.  Yeah, not saying, obviously not saying I was the coolest, you know, dude on the beach  or any of that shit.  Coolest dude.  But I remember distinctly going, how am I going to pull this off?  Because this girl is jealous of everything that we do.  So is this a weird thing you did on her knee?  I figured if I could rub her knee.  I remember this.  Her kneecap. 
[00:04:00]  Why wouldn't you go onto her back and shoulders?  Because I knew that would be hell.  Oh, yeah.  She'd have fucking had your whole fuck.  We talk about your ex way more than we talk about my ex.  Oh, yeah.  She was a jealous one.  So I'm like, I think I could rub lotion on her knee, and maybe that would make the bit  work.  I don't know.  Look at that.  You look.  I flat palms on her knee.  It's the worst lotion rub ever.  Because if I put my fingers, I remember this.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  I'm like, all right, if I take the lotion and put it on the palm of my hand and rub her  knee like this, I should be all right.  Yeah.  If I close my fingertips around her knee, that would be bad, too.  That girl's pushing 40.  That girl?  I don't know.  What year was that?  That's by 97?  No, this one's even earlier.  This was 97.  And we were suspended.  I don't know why.  But we were.  For this?  That's a wow thing.  No, there's a thing blinking that says, currently serving a two-week suspension. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, man.  Maybe you're on vacation.  No.  That was real?  We didn't do the fake suspensions.  Yeah, we had that.  It was.  We were always getting into some dumb trouble.  That wasn't the.  I don't remember why, though.  Was this at.  This wasn't at the AF Beach Party, was it?  It might have been.  Because if it was, we were suspended because of that wow article that that fucking bitch  wrote in the Boston Globe.  Oh, right.  Remember?  For now, right?  Yeah.  I think we got suspended for that.  National Organization of Women.  Just to calm everyone down. 
[00:05:30]  Like, Bruce was like, look, we got to take you off.  It wasn't like.  It wasn't a suspension like, oh, fuck, we were worried about our jobs.  Are we going to get fired?  Yeah.  It was a suspension.  They had to show the city that they were doing something about us.  Yeah, yeah.  But behind closed doors, I remember Bruce saying, everything's cool, but we have to  do this just to show that we're taking responsibility or something.  I don't know.  But somebody nailed it with that lotion thing.  Yeah, that was exactly it.  Oh, there's so much awfulness in this video. 
[00:06:00]  I watched this last night, too.  Yeah.  But was it the way somebody phrased it?  Because I noticed that.  It was an awkward hand motion, but my mind didn't grab what it was.  Yeah.  But then I read the Twitter, and someone said, I'm obsessed with how awful he rubs the  lips.  And I'm like, oh, the fact that a listener just picked that out immediately made me  laugh.  Great.  What, the pink shirt is all right?  The pink shirt.  The jean shorts, I didn't notice.  And the giant jean shorts.  Because I watched on my phone.  But some of this stuff is not fit.  Oh, whatever.  I think you should have seen it.  Just take your beating.  Right.  No, I need to see it.  It's good. 
[00:06:30]  But people are beating me up for jean shorts.  I'm like, hey, go find your fucking pictures from 97, 98.  Everyone was wearing jean shorts back then.  I didn't like your run over, though.  There was one thing with the run you did that I didn't care for.  I think it was a very good run.  Oh, no.  When you go over to get the ball, it was something you went to get the ball.  It was not a good run.  No, no.  We'll address it.  No.  It was really bad.  Because we were running like seven feet.  Yeah.  She was right there.  I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  I would have preferred in the bit, because there was actually a couple of funny things, like  the idea of you being the nice guy and you being the goobers and gallon.  Well, that's exactly where the bit came from.  Goobers and gallon.  Yeah.  But I feel like they're kind of setting it up the same way.  Like, they might have tried it a little bit of a different...  Right.  Instead of just going, here's what we're going to do, and Hank going, okay, I'll try it,  messing it up.  It probably could have been a better way to get into it.  Right.  I hear you.  I love how we talk about this, like it's this version of us doing this wrong.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy.  I just point it out. 
[00:07:30]  I liked my black sneakers and thigh-high fucking socks I was pretty much wearing.  Dude, on my phone, on a postage stamp-sized screen, I hated your socks.  And they were pulled up, and I'm on the beach, and that fucking, that tribble hanging off  the back of my head.  You haven't seen this, Sam?  No.  It might make you feel better.  No, I think it might make him sicker.  Yeah, Sam's back.  Welcome back from your flu, your fake sickness.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:08:00]  Everyone's got to do that.  Everyone's wild.  It'll take a couple days.  A little fake sickness.  For yourself, you know, to relax.  Relax a little bit.  Oh, sure.  Wind down a little.  Chill out.  Get some auditions for shows.  We, you know, WWE.  We've got to be getting.  Collect some empties, mon.  I've got to say empties, mon a few more times.  Empties, mon.  And then I can print up the t-shirts.  Check out the empties, man.  I love it.  Oh, what a great clip.  When I refer to the Opster, this is it right here. 
[00:08:30]  It's the Opster.  This is the Opster.  We're in full fucking bullshit mode.  I, I, I, I, I've hit my limit with these old clips.  Yeah.  We just got one more to get through.  And this one's even not, there's only a couple of moments in this one that are fairly awful.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The girl's hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was how we got her.  We just picked her off the beach.  I don't remember her at all.  No.  I doubt it.  She was probably one of the girls from Tens or some. 
[00:09:00]  Tens Show Club.  Probably.  Because wasn't that, where were we?  Way up at the beach there.  Hampton Beach Casino.  We were up in that area.  Yeah?  Yeah, I believe so.  Real Rock TV from 1997.  Seven.  Another douche chill clip.  Crazy.  All right.  Let it roll.  Did you get douche chills?  I, I just looked at my Twitter last night.  I was like, oh my God, he just posted this.  I didn't know it would do.  It was like, it was like, it was like waking up and finding just a gift.  Yes.  It was a gift.  I found a gift on my Twitter. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  It's pretty, uh.  Did I get douche chills?  I had a couple of moments.  Yeah, there was a couple.  But I haven't seen it on a big screen.  I'm telling you, it's different when you watch it on your phone.  You don't catch every nuance.  Yes.  It's weird.  It's weird to think this is, uh, 17 years ago.  That girl's probably 42.  Probably.  She's probably 25 back then, 24.  Probably.  All right.  She's at least 40 now, right?  Oh, yeah.  That's about right.  You want to date her now?  Oh, let's see what she looks like. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, were any of these, uh, a lot of, a lot of guys in this, uh.  A lot of dudes on the beach.  A lot of guys on the beach.  Just watching.  You didn't have anyone like Kenny just to push him back two feet.  Nah.  It was like, you guys are sitting there with all these man legs behind you.  Yes.  Dude.  Guys love us.  Yep.  I wonder if any of those guys are still listening.  And if they were at the beach that day.  Oh, man.  Anyway, here you go.  All right.  Let it rip.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're doing summertime tips today.  Yeah, this is fun.  It's the beginning of the summer.  And we figure guys need a little help on how to pick up on the girls on the beach. 
[00:10:30]  Little tips from Opie and Anthony.  Exactly.  You want to pick up a girl at the beach?  All you need is a ball.  A ball.  One ball.  And a chick.  And a chick.  We need a chick.  They look one way into the camera pants.  There's a chick.  There's a chick.  Boy, that doesn't look like a setup at all.  She's not even near anyone else.  She's just in the middle.  Right.  I'm sure people are like, no, you've got to clear that out.  Right.  Clear that out.  We're doing a shoot here.  Yeah.  We're doing a very important TV show here.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  She's just kind of leaning back, looking directly at the camera.  Yeah.  Wait, tits, though.  Hold on a minute.  Nice big fucking tits.  Tim in Connecticut, go ahead.  One of the funniest parts of the video is when the girl rubbed your leg after you rubbed  her knee, and the guy yells, rub the salami.  I didn't hear that.  That's a class act.  Rub the salami.  Salami, all right.  Yeah, she does look pretty good there.  She's all right.  Yeah, like the type of girl that just goes to the beach by herself. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, just sits there.  Just sits there.  Needing someone to talk to her.  Waiting for maybe a radio personality to do something to come over and talk to her.  Hopefully somebody's got a ball.  A ball.  That's all you need.  In front of his jealous girlfriend.  She was jealous of that.  What a killjoy.  That's the worst.  Ladies, I just want you to know, I had a girlfriend that was jealous of that.  Yeah.  A little hand on the knee.  Oh, go ahead.  Yeah, okay.  All right, check this out.  You take the ball. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  And all of a sudden you go, whoops.  You drop the ball.  It hits the girl.  And she stops it.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Mr. Bob?  Yeah, you want to play?  All right.  That run over.  Can you see the run over?  Oh, that run over?  Yeah, you guys can't really see it.  I think this is the run over.  Well, the video is in all the usual places.  Go get a bunch of dudes.  There's all the dudes.  Look at all the dudes.  Yeah.  There's not a girl in sight.  No.  No.  Except for the plant.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  You want to see the run again?  Yeah, let's see the run.  Yeah, I think this is the run.  What's wrong with the run?  I don't know.  It's kind of like from Taken.  You should be running to eat a pony.  I'm sorry.  Well, I think you started to squat down to talk to her.  Right.  Like a little too early.  At the beginning of your run.  So you run and then you start squatting down a little.  Yeah, we should be playing midget music.  There's a weirdness to that run.  Oh, boy. 
[00:13:00]  It is a little like Gollum.  Let me get my hands on her.  Trying to get the precious.  I'm sorry.  Mr. Ball?  Yeah, you want to play?  Absolutely.  What are you playing?  I'm playing ball.  Pause.  Great improv.  Great improv.  What are you playing?  I'm playing ball.  I had all day to come up with a line knowing we were going to do the bit.  Great improv. 
[00:13:30]  What are you playing?  Oh, ball.  I'm playing ball.  I'm playing ball.  It's a volleyball.  Just say volleyball.  Volleyballer.  Fucking.  Where's the volleyball net?  So it's got to be just ball.  Yeah.  He's having a catch.  I'm playing ball.  It's a grown man just throwing a ball up and catching a cologne.  Right.  Yeah.  It's okay.  It's good that you guys never did a take, too.  I respect that.  One take.  One take.  Perfect.  We got it.  Yeah.  All the outtakes are at the end of the bit.  What are you talking about?  We did more than one.  A man might not know what ball game he's playing. 
[00:14:00]  A man may squat and run at the same time.  What are you playing?  Ball.  Ball.  I like that, too, because you said ball three times.  Like, ball.  Right.  And then she said something.  Ball.  Yeah, ball.  Ball.  And then I walk back to Anthony C.  I'm a stud.  I saw that.  Ugh, Christ.  Right?  Nice pink shirt.  All right, Anthony C.  That was smooth.  That was smooth, right?  I started a conversation with the girl.  I think I got it.  Just the ball. 
[00:14:30]  You tried.  Okay.  Anthony wails the ball.  It's in the head.  Oh, my God.  Balls.  I'm an asshole.  Well, yeah, that was funny.  Here's what a little bit better at it is if you probably didn't set it up almost, like,  the same way, like, you should do that with another girl.  Oh, yeah.  Well, then we would have needed two girls.  We didn't have the budget for two girls.  Possible.  I love this, Jimmy.  Do they charge you for that?  That girl?  Look how we're dressed.  We don't even have money yet.  Oh.  How are we going to get two girls?  We just have a bunch of dudes in, like, the strip club. 
[00:15:00]  The strip club gave us a girl, begrudgingly, I'm sure.  Yeah.  A little, uh...  I don't remember that shirt at all.  What is this shirt?  It's a happy face shirt.  It's cool.  With Rasta dreads.  It was probably frowning by the end of this, bitch.  Yes, I bet it was.  Know why you don't remember this shirt at all?  Huh?  Because you would just take free T-shirts home from the radio station.  I would.  That was my wardrobe, was just the free swag shirts from everywhere.  So you got that from the radio station.  Newberry Comics, the fucking station, any local event we were doing, the bars that I'd go to. 
[00:15:30]  Those are all my shirts.  Yeah.  And I was getting my shirts from the female radio station.  I guess.  Yeah.  Why?  Your breast cancer awareness shirt.  Oh, boy.  It's horrible.  That pinky shirt.  And then the angle's wrong.  Like, you're hitting her in the head, but the ball's coming from the other side.  I know.  It should have been in the front of her face.  Now we're getting a little too technical, I guess.  Another girl might have been good.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  Look, there's not a girl in sight.  I mean, what are we going to do? 
[00:16:00]  What are you going to do?  And I'm sure we didn't write this bit ahead of time.  No.  Usually when we had to do these things, we would show up at a location and then...  What do you want to do?  And then we'd go, what do you want to do?  Yeah.  Kind of like how we do the radio show every day.  Right.  How was that, man?  Dude, she called you a a**hole.  That wasn't good?  I don't think so.  Uh-oh.  And I'll be back with some more tips in a little bit.  I thought it was good.  Oh, that's a good little improv there. 
[00:16:30]  A little back and forth to take us to another segment.  But at least the shirt's tucked in.  Oh, Sam Roberts.  It's important on the beach.  You don't like a tuck-in shirt on the beach.  There was a time when you tucked your shirt in.  I know, and then you blouse it.  You blouse it out a little bit.  It's cool.  I bloused it too at times.  I was guilty of the blousing.  You were guilty of pulling it out a little bit.  I lived for a good blousing.  I loved a good shirt.  It would cover up a world of hurts.  By the way, I love how I talk about the old days with what I'm wearing, and this is 
[00:17:00]  what I'm wearing today.  A Grand Theft Auto 5 shirt.  You're still getting free t-shirts.  Exactly.  Jesus.  What do you want, a tuxedo here every day?  No, but there's a line between that and a tuxedo.  Oh, like Sam Roberts?  That's true.  The suck-up with this fucking, what, you like brown today?  He's got your UPS driver.  That is true.  Your tan slacks are enraging.  You've got a lot of brown on you.  A lot of earth tones.  Earth tones.  Earth tones.  All right, I'll take earth, but there's khaki-colored pants and a black denim shirt.  It's a brown shirt. 
[00:17:30]  It's not brown.  It's black.  It's the only one that's going to go through life completely cool.  Yeah.  That's right.  Look out.  You're never going to have an awkward stage, are you?  Well, every stage of mine is awkward.  That doesn't mean I can't bring up your blousing.  That is a good point.  People bloused back then.  I fucking...  1997, you bloused.  You bloused.  I'll say this.  I had fucking workout pants, those baggy ones, and I would blouse with a mock turtledex.  My nickname should have been the Blousing Kid.  You talking about Zubas?  I don't know what they were called. 
[00:18:00]  I got them from...  Joey Bonofuco pants?  Yeah, I got them from a guy named Mark Vito, who ran Club Casbah, and they were those purple  baggy ones you've probably seen the pictures of.  And I would tuck...  It was my first headshot with me with my hands over my head, making like a muscle as a joke.  But I wish I could find that picture, but I think I'm tucked in.  I never went Zubas.  What's that?  I got a pair of Zubas.  I never went Zubas.  No.  Oh, you have them now?  Yeah, I wear them at home all the time.  Why?  Are they coming back?  You wear them at home all what? 
[00:18:30]  Home.  Do they have Velcro on them?  No.  Mine had Velcro.  Are they soft?  Yeah.  They were comfy.  I can't believe how much I love those.  That tearing sound.  Why do you have Zubas?  Are they coming back?  No.  They still look ridiculous, but they're very comfortable.  I can't believe how I thought those looked good on stage.  Oh, you wore them on stage?  Oh my God, that was my dress, my outfit.  Should have rainbow suspenders, too.  I thought it looked really good.  But Zubas were very hot for a while.  They were the rage. 
[00:19:00]  I just, I could never go there.  And I was always looking for the latest fashion back then.  Obviously.  Yeah.  Thank you.  My salmon colored.  It's not pink, it's salmon.  Now I'm sitting next to the girl.  It's salmon colored.  And mine was periwinkle.  Sitting next to the young lady.  What's it say there?  Oh, it says more sex on the beach with Opie and Anthony.  Oh, careful.  Look at her tits.  Yeah.  She does look good.  She looks luscious.  She's got a nice bathing suit on.  Yeah, put my dick between them. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, wow.  This bikini cut up high.  Mm-hmm.  See, because that was the style, too, back then, Sam.  Oh.  It was before boy shorts.  Right.  Oh.  They rolled up high on the hips.  Nice.  Teabags.  Whale's tail.  Yeah.  Right.  It was all about the teabag.  Yeah, yeah.  Which you see later on in this fine production piece.  I'm fucking hungry.  All right, more beach tips from Opie and Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  I established a conversation with this fine young lady, right?  Now you've got to be concerned with her needs.  All right?  We're talking, we're hanging, we're catching some rays.  All of a sudden, I...  Ha, ha, ha.  What?  That one was quoted last night a lot on Twitter.  Yeah, I quoted that one on Twitter.  We're talking, we're hanging, we're catching some rays.  You guys are going to...  Check out the empties, man.  You won't be laughing when you see those t-shirts all over the place.  I know.  Catching some rays.  That'd be a good summer shirt right there.  Hanging, we're laughing, we're catching...  Catching some rays. 
[00:20:30]  That's what you're talking.  Hanging.  It's like a David Lee Roth song.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, good.  This is good stuff, though.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  That's right.  There's a lot of rays and Franks and Joes behind you.  Plenty of them.  All man legs.  Look at all that hairy man leg.  What the fuck?  We attracted a type, didn't we?  Oh, man.  I got to hear that.  What?  I missed that last part.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It's a good catchphrase.  Concerned with her needs.  All right, we're talking, we're hanging, we're catching some rays. 
[00:21:00]  We're talking, we're hanging, we're catching some rays.  Let me write that down.  I like that with your hand, you kind of look up and reference the sun.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, that's how you get the rays come from.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Talking, we're hanging, we're catching some rays.  All of a sudden, I notice that she's got a little bug on her shoulder.  Oh, sweetie.  You got a little mosquito there.  Let me take care of that.  Oh, thank you.  That was so sweet.  Whoa.  You just brushed a fake mosquito if you didn't touch her. 
[00:21:30]  You barely touched her.  Because my girl was right there.  Yeah.  A very jealous girl.  I know.  Would have been hell to pay.  I'm taking inside of the bit.  Would have been hell to pay when you went home.  I was freaking out inside going, what will I do wrong today?  Oh, boy.  You couldn't have told her it was show business?  Do you know what me and Anchor...  Would you believe that if you were her watching this?  Oh, boy.  Do you know what me and Anchor would have fucking done back then?  Oh, God.  I think that's the best. 
[00:22:00]  And in retrospect, we should have dove head first.  I like how you do that and the crowd responds like Fonzie's just walking into Arnold's.  I know.  It's just...  Woo!  A little mosquito.  Yeah, a little mosquito.  I don't think your hand touches her when you're butthole.  I know.  I'm telling you.  I bet you the mosquito didn't even leave when you did that.  It just wasn't worth it.  Yeah.  All right.  I wasn't even doing anything.  Fucking...  That's the worst part.  You should have.  You're going to take your shit for it.  You should have, obviously.  Them's the rules. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  I'm going to give this Opie tip a try.  I didn't hear that.  And I watched this a few times last night.  Yeah.  Rub the salami.  Rub the salami.  It wasn't for rub the salami.  Anthony, give it a try.  Oh, no.  You're not set.  You rub the salami.  Anthony, give it a try.  Rub the salami.  I wanted her to rub the salami. 
[00:23:00]  Why are you so angry and aggressive in this bit?  I don't know.  I think that was supposed to be.  I think I was just picturing it was my wife at the time.  I was smacking her around, throwing shit at her head.  Yeah.  I'm so happy.  Then you just sit next to the same girl.  Yeah.  It was my turn.  I know.  With my shoes and socks on.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Your ankles were covered.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  What? 
[00:23:30]  Anthony, give it a try.  I'm going to give this Opie tip a try.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a really frightening look.  I got black sneakers, white socks, green shorts, a fucking liquor fucking t-shirt.  A radio station t-shirt.  A WAF hat.  And used to wear the-  Sunglasses.  You used to wear the colors of the radio station.  Oh, yeah.  I was very proud.  Mm-hmm.  You look like a beach bum.  Yeah.  Well, without the beach part. 
[00:24:00]  Contact.  Hey, I noticed you got a little bug on you there.  Could you get it for me?  Sure.  Ow!  This is right in the tit.  Which is very funny, but the camera guy fucked up.  That's not your fault.  Yeah.  They show the newspaper beforehand and then come away from it at the last second.  Yeah.  They should have hid the reveal.  I hear you.  But that was still a funny bit.  I smacked it right on her tit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then she grabbed the paper and started smacking me.  So you're saying this would have been way better with a little production?  A little.  Not even a whole lot. 
[00:24:30]  A different girl.  It's not us.  It's the production value.  A little bit.  A different girl.  Yeah.  I like this.  A different girl and then maybe, you know.  Mm-hmm.  The wardrobe department.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Oh, well, maybe.  Well, that's who those guys were, so you can't not be who you are on video.  That is true.  It's kind of funny if you guys are just trying to dress awful at the beach.  Or we ever.  I kind of like that.  Stunt coordinator to help with the running?  Just, yeah, the running thing.  I would probably have said, cut.  Let's give that run another shot.  A running consultant. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  For the film.  Don't squat and run.  We're not, you know, just a small ceiling here.  Outdoors.  Hey, that didn't work.  All right, it's time for another beach tip.  You're hanging.  We've been having a great time.  We've been here now a couple hours.  You really got to take care of your lady at the beach, okay?  For example, sweetie, why are you getting a little red on your knees?  You're taking care of your lady.  Oh, I am.  Could you help me?  Oh, I could easily do that for you.  We hear her voice again.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't she be able to... 
[00:25:30]  Why would she need help getting out of her knees?  She could do her own knees.  Exactly.  She fucking...  You should have done her shoulders and then gone down onto her tits.  Do I have to repeat myself over and over again?  Why don't you run it on your stomach?  I had a very jealous girlfriend watching.  So I knew I could touch her knee, maybe.  That was it.  She probably got mad at you for that, too.  I'm sure.  Oh, sweetie.  You're getting a little red on your knees.  Oh, I am.  Could you help me?  Oh, I could easily do that for you.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am. 
[00:26:00]  Could you help me?  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am?  Maybe I have some suntan lotion here.  Oh, I am.  Yeah, could I rub some lotion?  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I got the lotion here somewhere.  This is Littman Lofty.  It rubs the lotion on its knee.  Put the lotion on the fucking knee. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, I could easily do that for you.  You have to rewind, Sam.  I am.  I am.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I could easily do that for you.  Oh, no, Sam.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  For example, sweetie, you're getting a little red on your knees.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I could easily do that. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  You pointed at her knee, but you didn't touch it.  It was very funny to watch.  Now that I know that.  Yeah.  Do I have to say it again?  Where's your girlfriend, Jones?  Fuck.  Oh, I am.  I remember going, how the fuck am I going to do this?  Why did I put up with that shit?  I guess we all ask that question, right?  Yeah.  I got shit about things I would say on the air about girls' pussies.  My girlfriend yelled at me one time.  I'd listen to you talking about girls' pussies.  I'm like, I'm not going to censor what I say on the radio for you. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  The show, I told her, it's not meant for you.  Don't fucking listen.  I really had it out with her.  Exactly.  Don't listen.  We were good guys, too, man.  And we still got so much shit from our girls.  Yeah, we saw a lot of nudity, but we didn't...  Oh, did we ever.  I always had a no-touch rule.  I'm like, maybe that'll be okay.  No.  Fuck.  Not okay.  Always a problem.  Then that was just a waste of time, anyway.  Right? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  So then you look back and go, holy fuck, what we could have done.  Yeah.  Passed up a lot of bars.  Oh, my God.  We should have fucking got a Greyhound bus and just sent them home.  Why didn't we just send them home?  Goodbye.  This is bringing up all this shit now.  Why didn't we just send them home?  Just send them home.  We were way more excited about our careers and where they were going than they were.  They were always fucking pissy.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Do you understand? 
[00:28:30]  We knew at the time where it was leading to.  There was no doubt in our minds, as you see ridiculous confidence in these old clips,  when we, we shouldn't have had any confidence yet.  We had no, actually, at this point, we did have a pretty big audience.  Did your girls know each other before you two?  No, but they came, became instant best friends.  Commiserating with the awful life they had to lead.  Yeah.  Yeah, we gave them really nice lives.  Fuck them.  That's what I say.  And we were respectful. 
[00:29:00]  We didn't do anything wrong.  Right up until the end.  Major wrong.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Major wrong.  At least you got out early.  That's right.  Fucking ski-daddled.  I probably hung in there, let me think.  Another couple of years, right?  I hung in there probably three to four years, longer than I should have.  Wow.  That is an asshole, ladies and gentlemen.  No.  Having married her and had a kid with her would have been...  Oh, no, no.  I always wanted to get married and have kids, but I just knew. 
[00:29:30]  I just knew.  But for some reason, I didn't pull the trigger.  I think it goes back to watching my dad do the exact same thing with my mom.  It's called enabling kids.  Don't do it.  That would have made you stupid.  You didn't do that.  No, at least I didn't go all in.  But I hung in a relationship three or four years longer than I should have.  Why?  We all do it.  Everyone's done that.  Even if it's not three years, some people have done it for six months and some people have done it for ten years.  Right.  Three years is not that bad considering, you know. 
[00:30:00]  Then when there was no career, then it was blatantly obvious.  I remember you came to my apartment on 43rd Street at the time, and you came up.  I still remember.  I was looking at my post.  I remember what I was looking at.  You're like, yeah, me and my girlfriend broke up.  You told me you were really bummed out.  And that was right after we got booted.  Right.  Not long.  I was probably bummed because we were together a while, but I also knew, fuck, finally.  And I'll get through this shit and figure it out now. 
[00:30:30]  You know, there's that thing.  It's like, oh, you know, the status quo is broken a little bit.  I don't know what to do, but freedom.  Freedom.  Remember when Francine came over?  I wanted to fuck Francine so bad.  Oh, my goodness.  No, I never did.  No.  No, no, she just hung out.  Talked to you.  No, I wanted to.  I was bummed.  Well, anyway, back to this.  Also, in the clip, your t-shirt sleeves are past your elbows.  Jesus. 
[00:31:00]  That really is bad news.  That was the style.  Yeah, wear shirt and culottes.  Fuck.  You fucking Joan Rivers.  What are you doing?  You're doing the red cock lips?  We got the fashion police in the studio today?  Yeah, the fashion police.  You fruit.  I'm just saying the tails on the T are very long.  Yeah.  But that's how the t-shirts were.  Most people escape the looking back at their douchiness because there's no video of them.  That's true.  This is back in the day when you didn't have a lot of video.  That's true, too.  You had to bring a huge camcorder to the beach to capture this. 
[00:31:30]  Not your phone.  If you're on video at this time, you're probably like a little kid.  Like your parents have the video camera.  Like you aren't at the age where you were able to just have a camera.  Oh, your uncle.  Yeah, sure.  So, yeah, you're right.  You know.  What are you going to do?  Show your fucking pictures.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  We've seen Sam Roberts on that Nickelodeon show.  He looked like a little fucking dweeb.  That's why I was probably dressed like that.  I had jean shorts on.  I should have just tucked in and bloused out. 
[00:32:00]  With their big flipper feet.  Stop saying bloused out.  You don't like the blousy look?  Blouse.  Not anymore, no.  I understand that at a time it was acceptable.  Absolutely.  But no one called it blousing out.  Well, that's what you would do.  I'm going to blouse my shirt.  You just untucked it a little.  Right.  No, you tuck in your shirt and then you kind of blouse it out a little bit.  Untuck it a little.  So it looks kind of blousey.  One tuck.  One no tuck.  I swear to you that I left the house that day thinking I looked cool as shit.  Did you really?  Fuck yeah.  No, that wasn't done to be ironic? 
[00:32:30]  If you want to go all in with this, I'm telling you everything.  Oh, no.  I guarantee I left the house thinking I looked cool as shit.  Oh, yeah.  I guarantee that that color was in for whatever reason, whether it was some band was wearing  the shirt or something.  A gay parade.  Right.  My best jorts.  Jorts.  Sam is a dick.  Those are right, though.  I shopped at the Gap, so I guarantee those are Gap jean shorts. 
[00:33:00]  Gap shorts.  That's cool.  Shorts.  I had the sunglasses that were in.  I think those were Revos.  Nice.  Damn.  Oh, yeah.  And the hair.  What are you going to do?  Hey.  I knew I had to sacrifice to get it to the place where I wanted it to.  You were a lovable mop top.  I had to grow it out.  Were you growing it out?  Yes, I was.  Did you ever tell Ant, Ant, you've got to step up your game a little bit in terms of  style?  Nah.  Like, you know, with the free t-shirts and stuff? 
[00:33:30]  No, I used to laugh that he would bring home all the free t-shirts.  Oh, it was great.  I had all kinds of...  What are you doing?  And then the ex-wife worked at the liquor store, of course.  So I was able to...  Like, she'd bring home just liquor shirts.  Yeah.  Because, you know, the liquor delivery guys would come, and they'd bring fucking swag and  shit.  So I had, like, Jack Daniels shirts and...  Did you have a bunhole liquor?  Uh, I think I did have a bunghole liquor shirt.  Nice.  It was bunghole liquors.  Right. 
[00:34:00]  Parking in rear.  Oh, I get it now.  Parking in rear, get it?  Bunghole.  Yeah.  No, it's a real place, Sam.  Oh.  It's a real place.  Bunghole liquors.  What was their slogan?  Something, something, and parking in rear.  Poker in the front, liquor in the rear.  Oh.  Say cards and booze.  Oh, I see.  Oh, that was the slogan.  Wasn't something like that?  Ant's not lying.  Yeah.  I mean, Ant's not, uh, whatever.  Yeah.  Poker in front, liquor in rear.  That's absolutely what the slogan is.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, I get it.  Who doesn't love that?  That's a pun.  What?  Do they really have poker, though?  I don't know.  Doesn't make sense if you don't have poker.  Right.  They probably just had, like, one card table.  I think it was just poker in the front, liquor in the rear.  They just wanted to put that on a shirt.  Yeah, they were trying more.  They didn't care.  They were trying hard.  Yeah, they were.  Well, I just found a pic.  I have a picture of how I used to dress.  Oh.  I did.  I recently found my first piece of press ever.  It was from November of 1990.  Right. 
[00:35:00]  Were you convicted?  It was a little newspaper article.  And can you see my fucking shirt that I was wearing?  Oh, it's, like, striped, and it looks like something E-Rock would wear now.  It's a child's shirt.  It's really awful, like a striped child's pajamas shirt.  Yes.  That is something E-Rock.  It's pajamas, it does.  It does look like something E-Rock would wear now.  You should see the rest of this.  E-Rock loves childish clothes.  He does.  All right, we should blow the rest of this off.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  People like closure on this radio show. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Also, people are writing down tips for picking up girls.  It is getting warm out.  It is true.  Boy.  Jesus.  Let's listen to, uh, if you recall, she's got a little redness on her knees.  Oh, that's what happens.  That's right.  Yeah.  Sweetie, you're getting a little red on your knees.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I could easily do that for you.  Uh-oh.  There you go.  Thank you. 
[00:36:00]  It doesn't look like you're using your hand.  Let's say someone off camera is holding the hand of the camera.  Yes, yes.  And just moving.  There's no life in the fingers.  You're just kind of moving your hand around on the knee.  But even that, and if it's the Hampton Beach Casino, which I think it is up there, the beach is outside the Hampton Beach Casino.  Yeah.  That's a long ride home.  I guarantee.  I have no idea anymore.  Oh, boy.  But I bet you it was a cold ride home. 
[00:36:30]  I bet you.  Just because I did that.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Maybe, was it nerves?  Because it sounds like, too.  And this might have been the same day I had a look at the beer taps when we were in the strip club.  Oh, right.  And you could call me a pussy all you want, but it wasn't worth it to me.  Well, everybody had a great idea that we'd all go to the strip club, even with the girls.  And I looked at my girl going, really?  Because this is not your thing.  Yeah.  She's like, no, it'll be fun.  No, it'll be fun.  And she's getting the vibe off of Jen, who's just like, I don't care where the fuck we got. 
[00:37:00]  So, you know.  So, we went to the strip club.  And I remember even saying then, I'm like, you sure?  Because I know this isn't your thing.  I know you have a problem with this type of stuff.  Opie had to avert his eyes like Medusa herself was dancing on stage.  He couldn't look at one of the strippers without his chick getting pissed.  I was doing all the moves, like itching your face and looking down.  Yes.  You were getting mad at the girl?  Your girl was getting mad at the strip club.  But I'm like, you said it was all right.  That's a clue.  What do you think we're going to do in here?  Yeah, what are you supposed to do?  So, I remember, and I've told this story maybe too many times. 
[00:37:30]  But I remember finally getting near beer taps.  Yeah.  And able to look through the reflection of the beer taps.  It's like, oh, good.  I can see it.  Because I still wanted to look.  A reflection.  Yeah.  I still wanted to, like, you know, look.  Take a peek.  It's embarrassing to even admit this shit, but it is the truth.  It might have been nervousness.  That your chick was going to get jealous, but it did also sound like your improv skills  failed you again.  Because you made a sound when you got the mic. 
[00:38:00]  Like you were about to say something.  But then you just decided to say nothing.  Oh.  All right.  Listen.  Well, this is where Cream Pie Jones got it from.  Oh.  Because I think he did a very similar.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  You go like.  A little lotion.  Cadaver hand.  Thank you.  Huh?  We're getting there.  Anthony.  I'm not going to try it.  Sure. 
[00:38:30]  Hey.  Ah.  Ah.  That isn't where Cream Pie Jones got it from.  Right.  Huh?  Except he was handling shit.  Shit.  That's all it was.  Right.  And seeming to enjoy it on his hands a little more.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There we go.  All right.  Let her out.  Now it's time for Ant.  Yes.  I hope he doesn't do anything outrageous.  I know.  I hope he doesn't mess us up.  No, me.  Yeah.  It looks like you're getting a little red sitting out in the sun.  You need a little lotion?  Maybe a little bit.  Okay.  Ah. 
[00:39:00]  You squirts it on her tits.  Everybody's laughing.  You loser.  You loser.  I wanted to start rubbing it into her tits.  Back to the tits.  You hear, you loser.  But I couldn't.  And why don't we do another take?  Because the lotion went popping.  I know.  It popped.  I didn't get a good load on it.  You didn't get a good splooge on her chest.  Like fucking Oswald squirted the lotion on her.  You loser.  Yeah, yeah.  Barely even got on her tits.  I know.  What do you want from me?  Sorry we're not as cool as Sam. 
[00:39:30]  This isn't about me.  But I was sporting the Sam Roberts long before Sam Roberts was.  I had the hat on and stuff.  But look at that.  That's a natural.  That is a natural.  That is true.  I'm a loser.  I'm striking out like crazy.  What do I do?  What do I do?  You got one more shot.  Go for the sweet talk.  Girls love sweet talk.  Talk about her looks?  Yeah.  Just go over there and whatever you notice about her, talk about it.  Nice and sweet though.  Hi. 
[00:40:00]  Hold on a second.  Where's your sweet talk?  I guess my sweet talk failed miserably.  So we went for the edit.  Wow.  And they don't edit anything out of this show.  No.  And then we're talking right above her.  You notice that?  Of course.  Plus it's the same trick that you just squeezed suntan lotion on her tits.  Which you forget.  And then you also hit her in the tits.  Will you shut up?  I know.  Go home sick.  And why are those other guys not talking to her?  Oh yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:40:30]  Do they have jean shorts on?  No.  They're wearing board shorts.  They're wearing all those 90s fucking jams and shit.  Yeah.  Like bathing suits.  They're in beach attire.  Why weren't we in beach attire?  I don't know.  Because you wanted to wear your jorts and bloused forearm t-shirt.  So terrible.  Jorts?  You don't like jorts?  No.  All right.  All right.  Can we get to the end of this?  Yeah.  Jorts.  Look at the c**s on you.  I was noticing your a**s earlier. 
[00:41:00]  It's a nice a**.  I like to get to that.  Come on.  We can make beautiful music together.  You know what I mean?  It's obvious you scored at the beach.  And here.  Is it something I said?  What did I do?  That's some a**.  She has a nice a**.  She does a very nice a**.  And the thing I don't do.  The director, Dave Douglas.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:41:30]  Pause.  He never did anything creative for this show or our radio show.  He didn't come up with the bit?  Maybe it's for the whole show.  I think he came up with the title.  Rio Rock?  No, his title.  Creative director.  Of course he did.  That's the most creative part.  I want to be the creative director.  I think it's the walk away with the song playing.  I want to see the rest of the walk away.  What are you writing in the sand there?  I'm a loser, I think.  Loser.  But you can't really read it.  Why would you be able to read it?  Why did you write I'm a loser in the sand?  Who writes that in the sand?  I felt bad because Opie left with the girl. 
[00:42:00]  She had a good a**.  She did.  Something bad about Opie.  Why did you write bad about yourself?  Well, you know, I was feeling bad about myself.  Yeah, why did you just walk away and grab her hand?  I don't understand how that happened.  How of a sudden did she like you?  Why?  I don't know.  Because you didn't hit her in the tent?  Because I scored.  I'm amazed I'm actually holding her hand walking down the beach, by the way.  You didn't even sweet talk her.  Yeah, really?  I'm amazed by that.  You got in trouble?  You got in trouble?  I really have no recollection.  She's going to get burnt everywhere but one-eighth of an inch of her knee, and she arguably  has a mosquito still on her shoulder. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I'm dejected.  Oh, our tape.  Oh, you a**hole!  Wait a minute.  Opie, you're a f***ing maniac!  See, there's the big reveal. 
[00:43:00]  Opie threw the ball at her.  She's f***ing.  Oh, my God, Opie!  She was a sexy girl right there.  You clapped her in the head!  She's sexy.  You son of a b***h!  Damn.  Then I had normal there, though.  Yeah, perish the thought.  We had a normal moment during the little bit.  Yeah.  I like the outtakes.  That's very cannonball run-like.  Very, yes.  Hal Needham comes on at the end and says,  Okay, cut it!  Yeah, the outtakes are actually better than the f***ing...  Well, as it turns out, Opie, not Anthony, is actually the psycho. 
[00:43:30]  Whoa.  Oh, no.  F***ing Sam.  Anthony codependently ran over there.  Of course.  Okay, I'll help you.  She was f***ing pretty juicy, though.  Help.  She was all right.  She was all right.  Oh, no, she had a nice ass on her.  So, I'll tweet the video, but it's everywhere.  What a lovely potty show.  Oh, yeah.  I wanted to kiss her.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, right on her backside.  I wanted to kiss her right where the sickness comes out.  That's good.  I think that'll be the last one for a while. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, huh?  I think.  I hope not.  No, I hope not, too.  There's a few hours.  There's more?  Oh, God, yeah.  Our old intern, Brian, put on his YouTube channel the waterbed.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's not as impressive as I thought it was.  No, it's not.  Was it bad?  No, it was all right.  I mean, we're not talking in it because we couldn't go to.  I remember we couldn't go to that backyard.  No. 
[00:44:30]  We had to stay at the station.  Yeah.  So we, our pal Jay, we sent there to be a correspondent.  Yes.  And that's where the famous, come on, her, came from.  Come on, her.  Come on, her.  Shit.  That was a long time ago.  Our friend Jay, who was from Atlanta, is now living in L.A.  That had a long time ago.  I missed the fuck out of that guy.  Long time ago.  Justin Stangle is checking in.  Yeah, what did he say?  He believes that there was one line that went underappreciated. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, really, Justin?  What was that?  That was Ant saying, we could make beautiful music together.  That was terrible.  Me and Jimmy did look at each other, and he cringed during the speaking of that line.  He let you off the hook.  I noticed.  We could make beautiful music.  What is it, the 30s?  Well, that's the funny part.  Even though this is like a silly thing, and you're just being silly, that was still a natural  thing to fly out.  But it was from Bugs Bunny cartoons.  Yeah.  Oh.  You know.  We could make beautiful music together.  You know, something like that. 
[00:45:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  Beautiful music together.  That was really bad.  You're right.  That was terrible.  You're right.  That's like...  That was a terrible line.  You went from talking about her tits and smacking her to being like, we could make beautiful  music together.  To like fucking...  Yeah.  I'm a 30s movie.  The photoshops are getting brutal.  Oh, wow.  There's Spicoli at the end of Fast Times at Ridgemont High after the surfing competition.  Yeah.  And it says, we're talking, we're hanging, we're catching some rays.  Some rays.  And we're going to wing on over to London and jam with the stones. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, the inspiration for the Oapster was absolutely Spicoli.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You made a conscious effort to be more like Spicoli?  Probably.  The Oapster did, I mean, not you.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Oapster was long gone.  Trust me.  Long gone.  Would you give the Oapster any advice if you could go back in time?  Oh, God, no.  What would you do?  I would probably try to drown him. 
[00:46:30]  Right there at the beach, huh?  Oh, God, yeah.  That's hilarious.  Just drown him.  Imagine some guy comes up and it's you now and you just start drowning.  It's like, what are you doing?  Who wouldn't want to drown their old self?  The first thing I would do is walk up behind me on the beach, real slowly, grab that fucking  hunk of shit hanging off the back of my fucking ponytail thing and just snip it right off. 
[00:47:00]  And then hold it up and go, what the fuck is this?  I would also push over my ex-girlfriend.  That's true.  I would say.  I would just yell at her, what are you sad about?  I'd serve the divorce papers right there on the beach.  Right there.  I'd be like, here it is.  When you guys look back, do you kind of regret staying faithful in these situations?  Yes, of course.  God damn it.  Jesus.  Opportunities all the fucking time. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  All the time.  Every day.  Unbelievable.  Ugh.  Yeah, you know, you can't have regrets.  You just got to move on, right?  You can't always get what you want.  I'm going to eat.  I'm starving.  Yeah.  We're talking.  We're hanging.  We're catching some rays.  More O.P.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  In here, in here, in here. 
[00:48:00]  Good evening.  I pick a side.  D-d-d-d.  Me.  To be a bad.  It's out.  That news.  From the news.  Now stay here.  Get down.  Get down.  What a riff.  Fucking great.  What a riff.  I never get tired of ACDC.  Never.  I'm good shit.  Angus Young, 59, today.  Happy birthday.  Al Gore, 66, today. 
[00:48:30]  Inventor of the internet and global warming.  Christopher Walken, 71.  Oh.  71.  And Mrs. Partridge.  Shirley Jones?  80.  80 years old, Mrs. Partridge?  And, uh, 80 years old.  Wow.  80 years old.  Mr. Kincaid's dead.  How did that Noah movie do over the weekend?  Pretty good. 
[00:49:00]  Rich Voss called me over the weekend yesterday, I guess.  What does a Jew know about that?  And he was going to see Noah with his fine wife, Bonnie, who was celebrating a birthday.  Yeah.  And I laughed at him because I said this movie was getting bad reviews.  But even a bad movie just does very well at the box office, huh?  44 million?  That's a good opening weekend.  That is a hell of a weekend there.  That's a boat movie right there.  A lot of people were under the, um, misconception that it was very religious-based, I guess. 
[00:49:30]  Uh, but it's, it's kind of a story about Noah taken from, of course, the Bible.  Uh, and, uh, made into just kind of a, an action movie.  Right.  Kind of a, you know, they don't really reference all the God stuff.  It's, uh, it's, hey, there's going to be this giant flood.  Here's what you need to do.  And here's what, you know, the, the, the hardships you're going to have to endure.  So, it's more of just a kind of an action-filled movie.  How do they explain, uh, getting the animals?  Uh, I don't know.  I think there's some magic going on. 
[00:50:00]  Because they said, you know, the creator.  They reference God as the creator, not God or any kind of...  They don't say God?  No.  They were too scared to say God.  I think so.  Ugh.  Maybe they didn't want to, you know, kind of divvy up the audience and make it like,  okay, this is a, is this a, a Catholic Christian movie?  If you're going to make a movie about Noah, you got a reference.  God.  God, even if you don't say God or, you know.  Well, I said the creator.  The creator.  They didn't really go with the God thing.  That's weird.  What did Noah call him, though?  I'm back in those days.  How did they talk? 
[00:50:30]  Hank, which is odd.  Hank.  He, uh, I, I, I, I don't know.  Well, I don't know.  Well, don't they say he lived to be 900, Noah?  I don't know.  Oh, this one begat, that one, that one begat, begat, begat, begat.  It's a whole chapter.  That's all it is.  I know.  You could skip that chapter.  Skip right through that.  Easily, yes.  Hey, is this 3D?  Everything's 3D.  Is it?  I don't know.  Is it?  I would assume it's.  See it in IMAX.  I would assume it's 3D.  There's IMAX 3D for this.  It has to be.  No, I am.  You can't put a reason about it without a 3D, uh, alternative. 
[00:51:00]  Look, Noah drives a car.  Apple falls.  Well, you're close.  What about the boat?  Could someone call us?  How big was the boat and did they try to get all those?  A few cubits one way, some cubits this way, another few cubits that way.  And since you don't even know what a fucking cubit is, eh, who knows?  Yes, I do.  What is it?  It's, uh, it's what you tell someone to do when they have a circle.  Tell them it's a cubit.  I thought it was a little fucking chair of the shot arrows of the Valentine's Day.  That's cubit. 
[00:51:30]  That's different.  Shut the fuck up.  The hipsters are smoking coffee.  Why?  That's, like, kind of legal.  It says screw pot and, uh, what else do they say?  Um, cigarettes.  The, they're smoking coffee.  What's that about?  But is it literally like smoking it out of a pipe?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Or do they smoke it and then brew it?  I don't know. 
[00:52:00]  There it is.  Forget tobacco, pot, teens turn to smoking coffee.  Could we just play a smoke?  Look at these wacky teens.  They're smoking coffee.  The Oapster would have smoked coffee.  Oh, this is in.  In a way never thought of before.  They're smoking it.  Coffee smoking is a dangerous new trend that's going viral among teens.  Why is it dangerous?  I don't know.  We've heard of people eating coffee beans, but smoking them is a whole other thing.  There are websites popping up online that will teach kids step by step how to roll their own coffee beans. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, this is what I hate about the news.  We're about to legalize marijuana.  They're turning everyone on to this.  I would have never known about this.  Who would have known?  Beanheads.  Something a young person would do and no one, no geezer would ever do this.  And that's part of the charm of it.  What does it do?  But the side effects can be dangerous.  People have reported trouble breathing, dizziness, vomiting, even hallucinations.  That sounds cool.  Whatever.  Let's smoke some coffee today.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  How do you do it?  I would just take some coffee grain, granules, espresso.  Right.  Well, espresso might be too thin.  You mix it with a cigarette a little bit or maybe a little tobacco.  Keep it burning nice.  Right.  Even.  And smoke up, dude.  Smoke up.  Yeah.  Cool.  I don't know.  That just sounds stupid.  So the Noah thing.  I bet no one's doing that.  So the Noah thing.  They don't really explain this.  Did he collect the animals or not?  Or did they blow off that part of the story?  Well, I think even in the Bible, Noah has like God's help, right? 
[00:53:30]  With getting the animals.  The creator's help.  So it's magic.  Oh.  They use magic.  Oh.  That's what it is.  Every time you can't explain something from the Bible, you just use magic because God  uses magic.  Nice.  That's all you need to know.  You push it for UConn now that they're in the final four?  They're my team.  They have been since the start.  I said it was going to be UConn.  With Shabazz?  You all in with Shabazz?  Huh?  What's that?  All right.  Yes, Shabazz.  There's Shabazz. 
[00:54:00]  I'm all about UConn.  But somebody said they're just not going to beat, what, Florida?  Yeah, you got Florida in there still.  You got Kentucky in there.  You got UConn.  Who's the last team?  Wisconsin.  Wisconsin.  Thank you, Sam Roberts, who doesn't watch basketball.  I don't think a lot of people saying UConn is not going to get past the Gators.  Well, the Gators are tough.  But, you know the last time the Gators lost in a competition?  I do.  In the final four? 
[00:54:30]  Who is it against?  I'm helping you.  UConn.  Thank you.  It's my sports break.  It's regurgitating everything I heard on 10-10 wins on my drive-in while I was going,  oh, get off the sports traffic.  I know, I know.  By the way, Justin Stangl has a perfect bracket still.  Does he?  Yep, he announced it on Twitter last night.  Perfect bracket still.  I'm going out on a limb here.  He didn't go lying.  He's not lying.  He just isn't part of that whole billion-dollar thing, payoff from what's his name. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, he should have been on that then.  From Buffett.  But he has a perfect bracket still.  Yeah.  Jimmy Buffett's.  Yeah, I think he's in the Jimmy Buffett.  Yeah, the Jimmy Buffett bracket thing is a lot different.  Bracket wager thing, yeah.  You win a margarita.  Wow.  It's great.  And a little parrot hat.  This guy's going to tell us how they got all the animals on the boat in that movie.  Oh!  I remember as a kid when I was learning about Nova.  Nova.  Nova.  Nova.  Nova.  Nova.  I taught you to smile.  At religion class. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You never went to religion class?  I went to catechism.  Did you go to religion class?  What's the difference?  You had to go to some strange couple's house.  Oh, fuck.  You got molested.  I so didn't do that.  I went to St. Anthony of Padua's church there, and they had a school there.  And it was the most depressing family ever was teaching the religion class, and you could  tell they had major problems in their house.  Of course they did.  It's the only reason they're doing it.  And we had to learn about knowing. 
[00:56:00]  I remember even being a little kid going, how the fuck do they get all those animals  on a boat?  Why doesn't anyone explain this to me?  That is the real deal breaker when a kid is learning about the Bible, is the Noah story.  Because then you're like, wait, even I can understand this.  I mean, according to Neil Tice, oh, they didn't do bugs, though.  Never mind.  You know there's over a million different beetles alone?  Yeah.  They took bugs on the ark, didn't they?  I thought it was just animals.  Well, bugs are animals.  Everything that didn't get on the boat died.  It must suck, though, to be on the boat and a mosquito lands on you and you can't swat it. 
[00:56:30]  Not that you would have in that video.  Well, just brush it off like Obie did.  Can you imagine that?  This kid was fine.  There's a bee fucking somewhere and you're like, kill a bee.  Don't!  Yeah.  No, we need them.  Exactly.  We'll never have good graham crackers if you don't see honey.  Honey.  Because I am dead.  I know there was an edit that went on when they got all the stories from the Bible.  They probably should have said the Noah one's going to be a rough one.  This one's going to be tough for people to swallow.  Yeah, so maybe we blow this one off. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  They liked it, though.  They went with it.  People actually look at that and think it really happened that way.  And it's almost like it's just childish to think that.  It's childish.  It's unbelievably childish.  Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, I know how they did it in the movie.  How?  It was CGI.  Oh, see.  Oh, they used CGI to do it in the movie.  Oh, so they must have did CGI back in Noah's time.  Yeah.  Do they really show all the animals on the boat? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  This never happens in my real life.  People don't just hang up in the middle of a conversation.  People is like sort of an ending.  How are you doing?  Or a follow-up?  It's like old 70s TV show phone calls.  Yeah.  When they're like, hello, hello.  Right.  All right.  I'll see you then at noon.  Click.  Right.  They never say goodbye on TV.  I guess they just figured it was a waste of time.  You assume they're going to save.  They could save a second or two, right?  All right.  And they both know they just hang up. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  That never happened.  Date is at 8.  Click.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  But where?  We don't have cell phones yet.  Conan.  Steve in Orange County.  Yeah.  When I was a kid going to a full-blown Catholic school, elementary school,  we were trying to figure out Noah's Ark.  And my genius cousin from Minneapolis says, well, if Noah's Ark is true,  where do transvestites come from?  And I didn't even know where a transvestite was.  It took me a while to figure that out. 
[00:58:30]  Where do transvestites come from?  Well, I'll field this one.  I don't think that they come from anywhere, sir.  I think that was just a natural progression.  Jimmy will send you a Google Maps, and he'll let you know where they come from.  Yeah, I would say, sir, that what happened was as ladies began to develop more,  they branched out.  Oh, okay.  So is it natural selection or unnatural selection?  Oh, I think it's very natural.  Natural selection, okay.  That's nature's way of going, these lovely ladies won't be having children, 
[00:59:00]  so we can kind of cut off the reproductive cycle of human beings.  Steve, you feeling those earthquakes out there?  No, no, I'm in Orange County, New York.  Oh, that's different.  We thought you were from the O.C.  I thought you were from the O.C., too.  This is the real Orange County.  I don't think anyone in the O.C., really.  Well, they did in Anaheim.  They're saying the big one's coming for L.A.  This is a sign that the big one's coming.  They always say that. 
[00:59:30]  But a lot of tremors.  What, over 100 tremors over the weekend alone or something like that?  That's a lot, right?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I would guess it is.  All right.  All right, we got a guy that saw the movie.  And reads the Bible.  This could help us out.  Oh, good.  Jeff in Kentucky.  Oh, it's this guy.  Is this your guy?  No, that's Larry.  Oh, all right.  Thank God.  All right.  What's up, Jeff?  Sorry.  I thought you were Larry.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, I saw the movie over the weekend.  And, you know, I went back and read the passages of the Bible about Noah just to see how close 
[01:00:00]  the movie really was.  And, you know, parts of it they got right.  And then parts of it they were wildly embellished on.  So, you know, they had to have...  Oh, no.  Isn't the whole thing a wild embellishment?  Right.  They embellished on that true story?  I thought he meant the Bible.  They embellished on what's written in the Bible.  Okay, fair enough.  We know.  We were going for a joke.  Fair enough, sir.  Yeah.  So, um, how did they get the animals into the Bible, into the ark? 
[01:00:30]  Into the Bible?  Um, both in the Bible and in the movie, God or the Creator, as they refer to him in the  movie, it caused the animals to go to Noah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's like that.  He could just call the animals.  So, that's how.  If he had to round them up, that would be a problem.  So, why couldn't God just make a big hill and stick the animals on that?  Yeah.  Why does fucking Noah have to build a boat and get every animal?  Well, by the way, people who believe that, Drek, how did he get animals from, like,  Africa and all these other rare animals that are, like, sectioned off?  Hmm. 
[01:01:00]  This is, if you believe the Earth is 6,000 years old, and this was a couple thousand  years ago, how did he get all of these animals from different places?  Hmm.  And then, how did animals like Komodo dragons wind up in remote parts of the world?  Hmm.  And, I guess, were they saying that they're water-based or whatever?  They were all let off on, what, Mount Ararat?  Yeah.  So, how did they get from one place to another?  They all just stand on magic floaty things, and the good Lord floated them over?  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, I think anybody who believes that the Earth is 6,000 years old is a fool. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  That's just, it just can't be right.  So, how did the animals get distributed after the flood receded and all of them got off of  the boat?  Like...  It doesn't say in the movie or in the Bible.  Or in the Bible.  Yeah, why would it?  You just assume.  Yeah.  All right, more magic.  So, they just went somewhere, and they're kind of exclusive to that part of the world.  Right.  But they all, no, got them from those parts of the world, got them on the boat.  Big giraffe swimming in the ocean, trying to get somewhere. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  40 days and 40 nights.  We've had a lot of rain here.  I don't think 40 days and 40 nights would be enough to have a boat float around the Earth.  To flood the Earth?  The Earth?  No.  And all that water would have to come from somewhere.  Yeah.  In the movie, there are actually springs that shoot up out of the ground to help with the  process.  But you do...  You know what?  You know what I don't get either?  The water we have on the Earth is the water we have.  Yeah.  No more gets made.  It's the full volume of water we have on this Earth. 
[01:02:30]  How do you make so much as to flood the Earth?  And then when it recedes, where does it go?  Can I ask a really dumb question?  All right.  Can you get rid of water permanently?  Permanently.  Permanently get rid of water.  I think you could change its form, but I don't think you could get rid of it.  To what?  Evaporate it?  To steam?  Yeah.  It'll evaporate into steam or freeze into a solid.  But that's not getting rid of it.  It'll freeze into a solid.  Permanently, right?  No. 
[01:03:00]  I don't think you can.  I think whatever water we have, yeah, I think it stays.  Unless you start busting apart the molecules.  Wait, let me think.  Wait a minute.  So if you get hydrogen, yeah, you get like a fuel cell type thing, make hydrogen and oxygen.  But I think in the long run, the byproduct of using hydrogen as fuel is H2O again.  So I don't think you can really get rid of it.  So when the cities start flooding eventually. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  Where does that come from?  We're not going to be able to get rid of some of this water permanently.  I don't know.  We'll be able to build around it a little bit.  It's crazy.  You've got to stand there with brums.  Brums.  Some brums.  A brum.  Swip it back.  A brum.  A brum.  Brums.  All right there.  I might be wrong on this, but I believe in the Bible it says that at the time of Noah  that rain had never fallen on the ground.  I believe.  I'm not sure.  How really?  Maybe all that one. 
[01:04:00]  Just idiocy.  It was the only thing really that lived.  It was kind of a fair land.  There's not one story in that Bible.  Not one story you could just go, oh, okay.  Everything's got this weird little twist to it.  I think Christ rising from the dead after three days is the most believable thing in the Bible.  What did he do?  He got up, moved the rock.  I can live with that.  That I could probably deal with.  We've all seen Walking Dead.  Of course.  We could accept that one.  Wait, what?  The Shroud of Turin is real even though they're carbon dated and they've said it's the wrong 
[01:04:30]  stuff and it's, you know, 2,000 years off.  All right.  We'll accept that.  It's real.  I got to frame it.  Hang it on my shop wall.  I'll give you $25 for it.  Did they throw that thing away yet now that they know it's like just...  Toilet paper.  That's complete nonsense.  It's not connected to Jesus.  At all.  How could you think that putting a cloth on a guy's face, you're going to get a perfect  imprint of his face?  When has that ever happened?  I don't know.  It's probably possible.  No.  Let's say hi to Mike. 
[01:05:00]  He wants to talk about the missing page of the Bible.  Oh, no.  Mike in Indiana.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  It's the one where in the beginning where it says this is a work of fiction?  Yeah, that's one.  Exactly.  Oh.  Whoa.  Characters may be coincidental and are fictional.  You ruined the guy's joke.  I'm sorry, man.  I apologize.  He's great.  Let it go.  Let it kill my thunder, man.  I'm sorry, buddy.  I didn't know you were going for a joke.  Good job, Mikey.  Let's say hi to Art in Pittsburgh.  Art.  Hey, guys.  What are you hanging on a wall?  Hilarious, Chip. 
[01:05:30]  Perfect for a Monday.  What made me start a doubt religion early on was listening to Bill Cosby's Noah.  It got me thinking about, yeah, this probably isn't real.  And that was hilarious.  I remember that one.  Noah.  Yes.  I love that bit.  I remember that.  Does it hold up?  How old is the Noah bit?  I'm sure it doesn't.  From Bill Cosby.  I would guarantee you it doesn't hold up.  I don't know.  Old Bill Cosby stuff.  It doesn't really hold up.  No.  I think it holds up. 
[01:06:00]  I don't think so.  The dentist?  I don't know.  His skiing story?  Yeah.  How old is that?  They're like 40 years old, probably.  Wow.  Wow.  How long is the Noah?  I bet it's fucking...  I bet it's an hour long.  It's like three minutes.  Oh, sorry.  It's three minutes.  Let's at least try.  All right.  Bill Cosby.  Noah.  Let's see.  The great Bill Cosby.  Black and white TV set.  Wow.  You're so young there. 
[01:06:30]  Thank you.  I want to talk to you about a fellow by the name of Noah who built an ark.  Now, everybody knows.  They ask you a question.  What did Noah do?  They said, well, he built an ark.  But very few people know about the actual conversation that went on between the Lord and Noah.  This is pretty brave.  You see, Noah was a carpenter and he was in his rec room sawing away, making a few things for the home there.  Hooper, hooper, hooper, hooper.  He's sawing.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  He's looking around.  Hooper, hooper, hooper, hooper.  Noah.  Who is that?  It's the Lord, Noah.  Right.  Where are you?  What do you want?  I've been good. 
[01:07:30]  I want you to build an ark.  Right.  What's an ark?  Go out into the woods, collect all of the animals in the world, buy twos, and make the ark out of cubits, 80 cubits, 40 cubits, 30 cubits. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  What's a cubit?  Let's see, a cubit.  I used to know what it is.  Well, don't worry about that.  Just go out and collect all those animals by twos, male and female, and put them into the ark.  Right.  Who is this, really?  Who is this? 
[01:08:30]  What's going on?  How come you want me to do all these weird things?  I'm going to destroy the world.  Right.  Am I on candid camera?  There we go.  How are you going to do it?  Want to make it rain for a thousand days and drown them out? 
[01:09:00]  Right.  Listen, do this, you'll save water.  Let it rain for 40 days and 40 nights, and wait for the sewers to back up.  Right.  That holds up.  That's a good bit.  Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know, it's quaint.  Coffee was brilliant, man.  It's quaint now.  I think it holds up.  That was pretty brave, too, for the time.  That looks like it's the early 60s.  Oh, yeah.  He was fucking brilliant, Bill Cosby.  Yeah.  Like, what a, to, to, they had zero content freedom on TV. 
[01:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  To talk about any type of religion or biblical stuff and being a black guy doing it, like,  that was definitely a brave thing.  Why did Noah have to build the ark?  Why, if God is so powerful, he would have been able to figure that out on his own, right?  Yeah, Noah had to do it.  Why did Noah have to do it?  It's always some test.  And what if Noah.  It's always some thing some guy's got to do that God makes him do.  It's always that.  And what if Noah, you know, collected a dud or two?  When he was collecting the animals.  Mm-hmm.  Would he be in trouble for that?  He probably did. 
[01:10:00]  Mm-hmm.  I don't know how that works.  Right.  Whew.  Hmm.  Killed everyone on Earth.  You fast forward, this is kind of interesting, actually.  You got Bill Cosby doing some controversial stuff.  Uh-huh.  That looks like at least 40 years ago, maybe longer.  Yeah.  And then you had Louis C.K. doing some God stuff on SNL this weekend.  That's made a big tizzy.  Has it, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Why?  Who didn't like that Louis made fun of God?  Like, what?  There's some people that don't appreciate that kind of thing. 
[01:10:30]  I understand.  They say that it was offensive.  He was talking about God being a murderer and God being your mother.  Yeah, just, it was a very funny bit.  Absolutely.  Very Louie.  And, you know, people, they can't take any type of joking about religion.  Now, I do understand that Christianity and Catholicism and whatnot, very open, fair game as far as humor goes. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  As opposed to other religions.  Right.  Right.  And people are just petrified to make fun of Muslims and the Islamic religion.  So, you don't see that.  So, when you see somebody doing something about Christianity, it's not really all that fucking brave.  They might catch some shit, but it's usually just from Twitter or fucking Bill Donahue.  But, for the most part, you know, you do something about Islam, there you go.  These days, these days, it's changing.  Now you've got an issue.  I don't think someone like Louis C.K. is doing that material to be brave, obviously. 
[01:11:30]  No, he's just doing it because it's funny.  Yeah, he found something that's funny.  Yeah, yeah.  And he, you know, worked it out and he put it on SNL and it was great.  Yeah, I liked his monologue.  He just came out and did stand-up.  Right.  That's what he did.  No wacky characters coming out or anything like that.  He said he wanted it to be a good monologue, too.  I saw him working it out during the week a couple times.  He's like, yeah, I really like this monologue.  He was a funny guy.  Yeah, he nailed it.  The crowd was a little flat in general.  I don't think they're there for stand-up. 
[01:12:00]  It's weird.  Right.  It's like, because I've seen other comics that have gotten up and just done stand-up  when they come out and do SNL.  And it's just, the crowd is just not there for stand-up comedy.  They're not a great stand-up crowd, but they're on live television.  Yeah.  They've never been on TV in any way, shape, or form, much less live TV.  So they're nervous, too.  I mean, the crowd is really weird.  I'm never amazed by the audiences at SNL.  I think it's because they're on live TV.  You prick.  What are you nervous for?  It's just a whole, it's an event.  They're nervous for you. 
[01:12:30]  I think so, yeah.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Can we hear a little of Louis C.K.'s crowd material that everyone, let's hear a lot of people  have a problem with?  Let it rip.  I can't see it, Sam.  Louis C.K.  Wow, good job.  Oh, thank you.  Dressed up, too, a little bit.  Jeans, black shoes, and a, yeah.  A little bit, though.  Good job.  Good job.  A little bit.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:13:00]  Well, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you.  That is very, okay.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's very nice.  I, uh, I hope somebody does that for you someday.  That was a very nice thing.  I hope you had a good day.  That's all I could do about it is hope. 
[01:13:30]  I had a pretty good day.  I went out shopping for some things I needed, and now I don't need them because I got them.  I got a white noise machine.  Do you know what those are, a white noise machine?  That's a machine that helps white people sleep at night because you shouldn't be able to.  I, um, I'm hungry.  I'm a little hungry.  I mean, I feel hungry.  I think that's what, Americans shouldn't say I'm hungry.  They should say I feel hungry.  If you ate today, you shouldn't say I'm hungry. 
[01:14:00]  Hunger's a real thing.  I don't have third world hunger.  I have first world hunger.  I would like a donut.  Some people say I'm starving.  That's offensive.  I'm starving.  I haven't eaten since two.  I'm starving.  Don't say that.  Because some people are starving, and they don't say it.  You never see a little kid in Africa with his ribs showing. 
[01:14:30]  He's like, I am starving right now.  I'm, like, literally starving to death.  It's, like, annoying.  I have two kids.  I went to my daughter's play the other day.  I don't know if you have kids, but there is no more joyful feeling in the human experience than when a child's play is over.  It's just nothing feels that good when you can say, I am not watching that any longer. 
[01:15:00]  True, Travis?  Every second my daughter's on stage, I can't breathe because I'm so proud of her.  But this is a bad show.  It worked really hard, and it didn't make it good.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  That's funny.  I'm glad I'm raising girls, though, because boys are, uh, I don't like boys.  I don't, I don't like, I don't like, that's probably a good thing to say.  I don't like boys.  I don't, I mean, I don't think women are better than men, but I do think that men are worse than women. 
[01:15:30]  You know, we just have, like, I was talking to my friend, and he said his girlfriend's mad at him.  I said, what happened?  He goes, well, I guess I, uh, I guess I said something, and then, uh, and then she got her feelings hurt.  That's a weird way to phrase it.  She got her feelings hurt.  I said something, and then she, could you more remove yourself from responsibility?  She got her feelings hurt.  It's like saying, yeah, I shot this guy in the face, and then I guess he got himself murdered. 
[01:16:00]  That's what happened.  I just shot, he leaned into it.  I didn't know.  He looks very comfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've never been murdered.  I'm going to die someday.  I, I accept that.  I don't know what happens afterwards.  Some people say you go to heaven.  I'm totally going to heaven.  I'm going to, by the way, this is the only voice I know how to do.  I'm totally going to heaven.  It's the only voice I have.  I can't, like, do impressions.  Like, this, this is my impression of the president. 
[01:16:30]  I'm, I'm the first black president.  I'm, like, literally the first black president.  I don't like him.  Do you guys think there's a heaven?  How about, if you believe you're going to heaven, clap if you think you're going to heaven.  Oh, that's silly.  Do you think you're going to heaven?  Yeah.  Really?  How old are you?  21.  21, and you're a lock for heaven already.  You're already gone.  He's doing crowd work on SNL.  For three years, you couldn't possibly make a mistake.  Well, good luck.  I don't think, personally, I don't think there's a heaven. 
[01:17:00]  I think maybe there's a God, but there's no heaven.  I think that's the best news you're going to get.  You die, and you're like, hey, God.  And he's like, yep.  And you're like, where is heaven?  And he's like, I don't know who's telling people that.  But I'm supposed to make a universe and then another whole amazing place for afterwards?  You guys are greedy dicks down there.  Well, where do I go? 
[01:17:30]  Just stand in this room with me now.  I don't like it.  Tell me about it.  I've been here since 1983.  Or whenever.  I don't know when God started, but...  I'm not religious.  I don't know if there's a God.  That's all I can say, honestly, is I don't know.  Some people think that they know that there isn't.  That's a weird thing to think you can know.  Yeah, there's no God.  Are you sure?  Yeah, no, there's no God.  How do you know?  Because I didn't see him.  How do you...  There's a vast universe you can see for about 100 yards when there's not a building in the way. 
[01:18:00]  How could you possibly...  Did you look everywhere?  Did you look in the downstairs bathroom?  Where have you looked?  God, I didn't see him yet.  I haven't seen 12 Years a Slave yet.  It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  I'm just waiting until it comes on cable.  I think if there is a God, I don't know if it's the one in the Bible, because that's  a weird story, is he's our father, and we're his children.  That's it.  Our father who art in heaven.  Where's our mother?  What happened to our mom? 
[01:18:30]  What did he do to our mom?  This is what people are mad at.  Something happened.  Somewhere in heaven, there's a porch with a dead lady under it.  Somebody's going to check the trunk of God's car for bleach and rope and fibers.  Well, how can we not have a mother?  At least maybe God's divorced.  Maybe he has an ex-wife.  God's a single dad, and he's raising us alone, and we're praying like, 
[01:19:00]  And he's like, I'm trying, and it's just me up here.  Maybe that's what's going on.  Maybe your life is your time.  This is our weekend with dad.  That's what life is.  It's your weekend.  And then when you die, you go to mom's house.  It makes sense that God would be a woman, doesn't it?  Because you're raised by your mom.  I think the reason we made God a man in our cultures is because  We want to make sense of the fact that men are in charge. 
[01:19:30]  Because otherwise, it doesn't really make any sense.  Because women, you start with a woman.  It's the thing people like to ask me.  What comes first, the chicken or the egg?  Of course it's the egg.  Because you can't just make a chicken.  You can't just go, chicken.  You can't start with an egg and grow a chicken.  And then people say, oh, well, where did the egg come from?  From a chicken, you idiot.  That's good.  Women birthed us.  Women raised us.  So why aren't they running things?  I think I know why.  I think it's because millions of years ago, women were in charge, 
[01:20:00]  and they were mean.  They were horrible.  They made us walk around naked, and they'd laugh at you,  and they'd flick your penis when you walked by.  They were awful.  Screw you.  But what could you do?  It's your mom and her friends.  Like, what could you possibly do about it?  And then one guy punched his mom, and we were like,  we can hit them.  And then we did the whole thing.  But that's why men are mean to women today,  because we're terrified of them.  That's why we didn't give women the vote until 1920. 
[01:20:30]  Women didn't get the vote in this country.  That means American democracy is 94 years old.  There are three people in my building older than American democracy.  That's how women haven't had a rough time.  It was so okay to beat your wife until so recently  that today we have a kind of shirt named after us.  There's a piece of clothing in our culture affectionately nicknamed  after beating the crap out of your wife.  And for some reason, this is offensive to nobody. 
[01:21:00]  I saw a woman on Good Morning America,  and she's like, I was walking around my house,  and a wife beater.  I'm like, stop saying it.  Like, it's not horrible.  I'm just wearing a wife beater and child murder shorts that I like.  We have a great show.  Sam Smith is here.  That's how great Louie is.  I'll say that's the best SNL monologue I've ever seen.  Yeah.  By far.  That's the best SNL monologue ever. 
[01:21:30]  That's how great he is.  We just sat here and watched it.  That was great.  But that was really great material, man.  That was funny material for HBO.  Right.  That was a great set.  What a great observation about God and no monologue.  Well, not according to other people out there.  Who's mad about that?  Religious people.  Why?  They said they were very offended that he would talk about God like that.  And I even read some tweets from people that were saying,  look, I normally find Louie very funny. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, that's shit.  Yes, I know.  That's shit.  Why can't you be religious and laugh at yourselves?  You can't.  Why?  Because it's very offensive to God and Jesus.  This guy can't be real.  Stop it.  Bill in California.  Bill?  Yeah.  Good morning.  Hi.  I think the guy should be banned from NBC, from network TV for those remarks.  Oh, yeah.  This is a country founded on Christian principles. 
[01:22:30]  Can't do that.  Can't do it.  Okay.  But do you feel that he should have the right to say what he wants as a comedian,  or do you think he should only kind of say things that push Christian values?  I think you can say what he wants in a private setting, but he's on public airwaves.  Why does that bother you so much?  I'm still not buying this, by the way.  Yeah.  On regular radio, we'd get the real peer letter against this guy.  This guy might be joking, but even if he's joking, he still represents a point of view. 
[01:23:00]  He represents a point of view.  Very good.  Bill, you joking?  You joking?  Yeah.  Of course.  I miss the days, though, when we got the real cast.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that is a view that people have.  Yeah, yeah.  No, people absolutely have that view.  Silly.  Let's say hi to Derek in Alabama.  Derek.  Hey.  What's up?  I was just about the Noah thing.  I was going to talk about how, like, throughout history, all across the world, 
[01:23:30]  you find different examples of a lot of stories that kind of have similar things.  And there are two ways that you can kind of judge them as time goes on.  And the one is people having to figure out things.  So, like, Jesus, Muhammad, and types of deities are just different cultures trying to figure out and explain why.  And then there are other stories, like the flood, which probably happened because you got accounts of around the same time in history of all over the world, stories about the flood. 
[01:24:00]  But the thing is, is some people kind of get stuck in the idea of having to explain it.  And then there are other people, and I'm guessing you guys are probably in this category, too, like me, who you watch specials on it and with, you know, scientific things.  And the answer is pretty simple.  A meteor killed the dinosaurs and a meteor probably caused the flood.  Because if a giant meteor hits in the middle of the ocean and displaces enough water, then, you know, that's going to fall. 
[01:24:30]  No, it's not.  But, by the way, let me ask you, if a meteor was big enough to do that and to cause floods all over the world, I wouldn't have done a lot more damage than it did.  Well, see, I'm honestly, this is off of a documentary that I saw probably three or so years ago.  So I'm only cursory kind of remembering.  So just, I'll keep that in mind.  But it convinced me, because I usually, what I'm getting at is usually for me, it's, if science comes out and, generally speaking, incredibly says, here's what most of us believe. 
[01:25:00]  I'm pretty well like, okay, as opposed to having to, you know.  And the thing was, what they presented was, is that, yeah, just like a meteor came that was big enough that killed the dinosaurs, is that this meteor came and it caused the flood.  Now, you're asking me if I know all the ins and outs.  No, I'm just saying that out of the things to believe, if it did happen, that seems to me like, okay, that's fine.  That works for me, is all I'm saying.  I don't need to get caught up in the idea of, oh, my God, it might have happened and how terrible and what. 
[01:25:30]  And, you know, it's a scientific explanation.  It could be wrong.  It could be right.  But it makes enough sense.  And, you know, I'm just, I don't know.  I just wanted to put that out there because no one had called in yet and offered any kind of other thing.  And, you know, there's also.  Thank you, Derek.  The Joseph on Twitter.  This is what's wrong with people who misuse words that they hear.  Like Joseph says, I'll give comedians credit for religious humor when they go after Islam. 
[01:26:00]  Until then, you're just hacks.  First of all, you're misusing the word hack.  You're trying to express an angry thought because it bothered you his bit or you didn't like the bit or the idea of the bit.  But to say it's hack, you just make yourself sound like an ill-informed novice.  It's the opposite of hack.  It wasn't a hack bit.  It's pretty brave material and very clever.  It wasn't a hack bit at all.  It was a really brilliant bit.  Funny or not, that's up to you. 
[01:26:30]  But there's some brilliance there, of course.  Some great observational humor.  And going after Islam, if you're going after Catholicism and just going, ah, it stinks.  I understand the thing, well, why aren't you saying that?  But, like, to me, the singers are more valid points to, like, Madonna with the crucifixion.  Like, all these fucking cornball singers that just show the cross and do their image of the cross being bad and, like, so naughty.  They're cowards in a way.  But when you're up there and you're actually breaking down why you feel the way you feel, that's not hack at all. 
[01:27:00]  And the thing with Islam is, believe me, Islam bothers me.  But my entire life, Islam has not been preached to me.  What Louis was talking about is what I've heard my entire life.  I have found Islamic sensitivity recently to be slightly irritating or very irritating.  But that's not what I've heard my whole life.  That's not the story that the United States hears most of the time.  So you're completely wrong, Joseph, on Twitter.  So use the terms right, or just be angry and say he sucks or that sucks.  But don't try using words like hack when you obviously don't know what they're supposed to be used for. 
[01:27:30]  Let's go to South Carolina.  Kent, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  I picked you, Pekka.  First thing I want to say, Jimmy, man, I saw your stand-up thing the other night.  It's Larry.  It's you, Louie.  Thank you.  My favorite comedians.  But, you know, I'm a Christian.  You know, I've done Bible study, all that stuff.  And I laugh my ass off for that kind of stuff.  You know, I don't understand why people have got to be sick.  I'm freaking serious about everything all the time.  You know, I believe in God.  I believe in all that stuff.  But you can also, you know, admit when something's funny. 
[01:28:00]  You know, like enjoy it.  Right.  I want to tell people get all bent out of shape about, you know, this kind of stuff.  When somebody says something, basically just to get a rise out of it.  Well, he doesn't say just to get a rise out of people.  But, you know, he's just sitting back laughing at this shit, really.  People have a hard time laughing at themselves.  Yeah.  As long as it doesn't bother them or it doesn't affect them, then they're all in and they'll  laugh their asses off.  But as soon as it's too close to home, that's when they tap out.  And then you have to say it's offensive. 
[01:28:30]  They get a little pissy.  But every time you make a joke, you're pissing off somebody, I would assume, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There are insecurities and stuff like that, you know?  Well, look what happened with Stephen Colbert.  I mean, look at the cancel Colbert thing on Twitter.  Thank God they didn't bite on that.  No, it's good.  Well, he's almost untouchable unless he came out and said something so horrible.  Yeah.  He's too big on Comedy Central.  But what bothered me about Sui Park and this group is that people, if they even recently  see that tweet, they just think he's saying chinky chong or whatever on a tweet for no 
[01:29:00]  reason.  Uh-huh.  And they go like, hey, dude, what the fuck?  Why are you doing that?  All right.  I can see them asking why he's doing that.  But A, he didn't tweet it.  And B, it was an out of context bit.  And then in context, he was showing these things.  Everyone knew what he was doing.  So once you get the context, you should then go, oh, okay.  I did my research.  I'm smart enough to realize now that he didn't mean anything like that.  It's all about a soundbite, though.  We all know that.  But they did know the context.  And they pushed it anyway because they said, well, even in context, he's still using Asian. 
[01:29:30]  And it's like people just want to feel like they have accomplished something.  Uh-huh.  And, you know.  Power over other people.  They just want to feel like their complaints moved something in some way.  People don't like the idea that they could be upset by something and have it fall on deaf ears.  Right.  This guy's very upset.  We got Josh in Tennessee.  Josh.  He's joshing.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, Josh.  I'll tell you the thing that really riles me up.  I listen to Louie's bit, and I think it's great.  I'm a Christian as well, young Christian, studying the Bible. 
[01:30:00]  And I find no offense in what Louie said.  Matter of fact, I think what he does is great because it brings up questions.  And I think that's the main point to develop, you know, some rational talk about these situations.  But what riles me up is to sit here and listen to Jimmy say what idiocy it is to believe in certain things like that with such hatred.  That's what boils my, I think.  Well, it's not hatred.  You're missing.  I'm annoyed by it. 
[01:30:30]  But it's not hatred.  And what I dislike is not the fact that people believe it.  It's the fact that their belief infringes on other people's ability to do certain things.  Or the fact that they want people silenced who make fun of their belief.  You know what I mean?  That's what annoys me so much.  Like, for me as a grown man, for other grown men to think that the Bible is literal.  Like, oh, six days.  But maybe that was just kind of a symbolic of, no, no, no, six days. 
[01:31:00]  Like, that's the part that annoys me.  It's not even what they believe.  It's the fact that they're so unbending.  And, dude, I was raised in Christianity.  I went to Catholic school.  I made my confirmation.  I made my communion.  I mean, I'm not some fucking atheist from the age of five.  You know, I've found that it is people who are really religious that have turned me against it.  Well, I can agree with that.  And I don't consider myself religious.  I consider myself more spiritual.  And, but I just, I have a hard time. 
[01:31:30]  You know, what I'm hearing is you're against dogmatism.  And I'm sort of the same way when folks say, well, these things absolutely cannot be literal.  Why can they not?  Why can they not be on the table?  It defies all logic and reason to a point where to believe anything else, to believe that it's true literally, is, it just is foolish.  And the reason I sometimes get angry when you're debating somebody that's highly religious and takes the Bible literally is because I can't believe that people can be sucked into something so easily. 
[01:32:00]  It's upsetting to me that people can be this naive and foolish as to believe the literal taking of the Bible.  Well, and policy is built around these beliefs, too, like stem cells.  Yes.  And that's the part that I find, I resent.  The fact that these religious beliefs affect policies or the fact that they want to keep gays from getting married and having their rights because the same people that believe, no, no, no, he really did get two of every animal. 
[01:32:30]  And then are the same people that say, well, that belief now tells me the gays are better.  You know what I mean?  It's not just them in their own little house believing this way.  They're affecting the rest of us by pushing their beliefs into our daily lives.  When you watch family members get sick or die from something that perhaps if stem cell research was available years and years ago and wasn't fought so hard by the religious right, perhaps something would have been done. 
[01:33:00]  That policy is being made based on a fiction book that people believe in, full of ridiculous things.  Well, again, and that's your belief against ours.  Yeah, it is.  But I have things that kind of back up what I believe, and everything that comes out of the Bible is backed up with, well, it's God's magic.  And I'll tell you, not to interrupt you, sir, because I don't even want to say something, but I am not so science-driven that I think they're always right. 
[01:33:30]  I think the Big Bang is idiocy.  I do not believe in the Big Bang.  That sounds crazy.  It might have started that way, but I don't believe it was an atom.  To me, the same way I look at this Noah story, which is nonsense, I think that we just don't know enough scientifically to think that an atom blew up with such force that it created what we see.  There's something in my mind, I don't care what science is showing with blue shift and red shift and the fact that something they will discover maybe 50 years from now, maybe 1,000 years from now, will show them that, oh, the concept of the Big Bang was kind of there, but the idea of an atom blowing up is just shit. 
[01:34:00]  So the problem I have with religion is they don't, at least science is always testing and retesting and bending and throwing out the hypothesis, whereas religion says, no, no, the book was written years ago, and that's it.  They're done asking questions.  They're done asking questions.  That's the difference between science and religion.  Exactly.  I don't want to cut you off. 
[01:34:30]  Sir?  Yes.  Okay, you know, you want to say something.  I don't want to cut you off.  No, that's fine.  And I appreciate you guys' views.  I love the show.  And I appreciate your views, naturally.  But I just, I wonder sometimes if it's absolutely impossible for you to consider these other views.  And I know how you feel about Ken Ham, and I heard you talk about the debate.  About what?  I would love to hear you talk to him sometime.  Ken Ham, Answers in Genesis.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would discuss with him sometime. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, I saw that.  I think that would be fascinating.  I like him with Swiss and a little mustard.  Yeah, I've considered those views, sir.  I really have.  And this is my reaction to those views.  I'm not, it's not like I just was handed these views and then the idea that they're nonsense.  Like, dude, I had my whole life to consider these views and hear them.  And the more I heard them and the way I saw people defended them against certain logic without bending, I just began to go, oh, that mentality that I'm looking at right now with this is the same mentality that went into the Inquisition and coming up with the Bible and forcing it that everyone's, you know. 
[01:35:30]  The fact that it's making, you know, the fact that it's affecting millions and millions of lives in a very selfish way is ridiculous.  You could have your beliefs, but if we have our beliefs and want to pursue certain medical venues and whatnot, why shouldn't we be able to without having this religion getting in the way? 
[01:36:00]  Right.  It's all about choice.  And y'all have made yours, I have made mine.  I think we're going to have to.  Unless it's a woman's choice.  We're going to have to agree to.  Agree to disagree.  Hey, appreciate it.  Thank you, Beth.  All right, buddy.  Let's go to Sal and Beth Page, a Catholic teacher.  Sal.  Sal.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Sal.  I'm a freshman at, I don't want to say the name, but one of the biggest Catholic universities in Queens, New York. 
[01:36:30]  And I am a catechism teacher for the Diocese of Rockville Center.  One thing is nobody likes making fun of themselves more than the Catholic Church.  I think that we don't mind people, you know, making satire about us.  Can I ask you that?  Can I jump in?  I apologize for the interruption.  Can I ask you when that began?  Because I know they ruined Lenny Bruce.  So up until the 60s or the 50s, Catholic Church did not have a sense of humor about itself. 
[01:37:00]  Well, what happened is in the 1960s, of 1963 and 64, the Catholic Church kind of changed its ideology with Vatican II.  Now, when I see people going, oh, you can't make fun of us because, you know, we're so sensitive.  We're not.  We are the biggest religious institution in the world.  We shouldn't be so sensitive.  And I look at those people and I go, you are so Vatican I.  You know, there's Vatican II, which is this new ideology, which we're a little more open. 
[01:37:30]  Now, you look at Pope Francis, right?  We just went from Pope Benedict, one of the most conservative, strictly business guys that the Catholic Church has ever seen in modern history, Vatican II,  to Pope Francis, who is one of the most open-hearted people you will ever meet.  By the way, how did...  I was just going to say that goes like that every few...  You know, every couple of Popes, you get a conservative one.  It's like a president, you know?  Yeah, they just...  You get a conservative one, you get... 
[01:38:00]  You know, John Paul was pretty fucking, you know...  Conservative, yeah.  No, he was kind of looked at, though, as the young Pope.  Right.  When he was first brought on, it was like, oh, this is a new Pope we got.  I believe he was very conservative, though, as a Pope, even though he was seen that way.  He didn't like no gays, and he wasn't for birth control or anything, but again, you've got to look into the context of the time also, which is weird, but...  And by the way, Benedict, the Catholic Church, forced him out, I believe this.  His eggs are great.  Yes, they are.  They are dumb.  Yes, but he's a traitor to the U.S., and he, you know... 
[01:38:30]  The problem with Benedict was that he, you know, what's his name, Ratzenberger, Ratzenberger, and he was the guy who ran that, whose desk all the pedophile scandals came through.  So it was the pedophilia stuff that I think forced him out, and the Catholic Church did that for their image only.  That's what I think, too, yeah.  He had to go.  He had to go.  He had to...  I mean, Pope has retired in 600 years.  In 600 years, you're right.  Anything else, Al?  Bucket.  Another point, if you don't mind.  Sure.  There's two types of views. 
[01:39:00]  There's two types of ways you could read it.  It's called contextualism and fundamentalism.  Oh.  The way Catholics look at it is contextual.  We look at the context of the Bible, and we go, this obviously isn't true.  Did Jesus really make Lazarus rise from the dead?  Or did he give a new life by saying, Lazarus, come and follow him?  No spoilers.  Did Jesus give sight to the blind?  Or did Jesus open their eyes to the concept of God, to the concept of him being the son of God?  Right.  Did God really wipe out everyone? 
[01:39:30]  Or did God tell Noah, look, we're having problems.  You know, there's problems.  Or maybe Noah took it upon himself to say, look, we're having problems in our community, in our God-following community.  Back then it was Jewish.  Everyone's filthy animals.  That's what we need to do.  We need a big change.  We need a big difference.  We need a Vatican I.  We need a Vatican II.  But back then, they used it in this, oh, well, God is really powerful. 
[01:40:00]  He wiped out the world.  That's how we want people to think happened hundreds of years ago.  So that now that they have this respect, almost a fear of God.  The term is used, I'm a God-fearing man.  Well, why do you fear God?  Well, because he caused this huge flood.  No.  You fear God because you respect his omnipresence.  You respect the fact that he's always watching.  You respect the fact that he's always part of our lives.  Not a lot of people that put their nose in everyone else's business think that way. 
[01:40:30]  They look at it as a literal interpretation of a, or a literal fucking recitation of what the fuck God said.  It's not God's word.  A bunch of people wrote that goddamn thing.  Oh, goddamn, I shouldn't have said that.  Oh, don't say that.  That's great.  I'm not going to point fingers at any specific groups.  My aunt, well, actually, no, my aunt is a fundamentalist Christian. 
[01:41:00]  She's a born-again, and my mother is a Catholic guinea woman, okay?  So when my aunt comes up to my mother and says,  you haven't been saved because you don't go to church every Sunday,  I said this, being in church every Sunday makes you as much of a Christian  as being in a garage makes you a part.  That's a fundamental way of looking at it.  I'm serious.  I like that.  This is what I tell children when I'm talking to them about confirmation.  Sure, about procreation. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Jeez, jeez.  It's not about being, and I'm being very honest with them,  and sometimes I get in trouble for this,  it's not about being completely chaste.  It's not about being, you know, going to church every Sunday and listening  because you might get bored.  That's honestly that's going to happen every time you go to church.  It's about going out into the world and being Catholic, being universal.  Here's my take on the Bible and all this hokum.  You could read this book, not assume for a second that it's all literal, 
[01:42:00]  and take away from it the importance of certain lessons that the stories tell you  about morality, perhaps, or how you should live your life and treat your family.  Like, take away those things from these stories.  Like, you'd read a novel, and you could learn from a novel and take away certain life lessons  from a character that a writer made up in his head and a situation they put him in. 
[01:42:30]  And I honestly think that was the basic intent of the Bible.  It wasn't to be read and taken as a textbook.  It was meant to use as a kind of a reference as to how you should lead your life  if you're into this, you know.  Does it say in the Bible not to blouse out your shirt?  It should have.  When you're trying to pick up a chick at the beach?  Yes, it does, but it condemns homosexuality.  Yes, right when it says two men shall not lay together.  Yes, blousing is definitely a fault under that heading.  Hey, Sal, what happens to you when you die? 
[01:43:00]  When you die?  Yep.  We don't know that.  Actually, we admit, I'm part of a Catholic leadership program at my school.  And we admit that we're not exactly sure what happens when we die.  What do you think, though, as of now?  As of now, I think what I have to do is, and I'm telling you this to 13-year-old kids,  what I have to do is take the Bible as a moral road map.  There you go.  To do, not exactly as Jesus did, because I can't give sight to the blind. 
[01:43:30]  I'm not going to try to do that, because that would make me insane.  I have.  What I'm going to do is, I'm going to do for the least of my brothers.  Because if I do for poor, that means I'm doing for Jesus.  That's what Jesus said in Matthew 23.  Lo, what you do for the least of my brothers, you do for me.  And I believe that in doing that, if there is, if there is a heaven,  and I'm not saying that there objectively is one,  I'm saying that if there is a heaven, what you do is, 
[01:44:00]  you follow this moral guideline.  And if there is, you will get in.  If there is a heaven, and by God, I hope there is.  Elias is up there smoking shit.  Heaven.  I'm going up to the spirit in the sky.  If that's what I'm doing.  Sal, I like your openness, though.  I like it.  I like it.  Absolutely.  That's a Catholic church.  That's right.  All right, brother.  Thank you very much.  But instead, we've got people that take it literally  and keep us from doing medical research  and keep kids from getting medication they need. 
[01:44:30]  But Sal is more of a free spirit with his religion.  He sounds like it.  I don't mind that at all.  But I bet he'd be out there with a sign  if someone went once to yank a fetus out of her fucking body.  God damn yank it.  Phones are lit.  Yeah, I love these calls.  Yeah.  You want to take more?  Yeah, they get to say what they want here.  It's like, yeah.  That's true.  I'm going to take another one.  Let's say hi to Greg in Texas.  Greg.  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:45:00]  Hello.  Hey, I just want to let you know right up front,  I am a real caller.  And I wanted to weigh in on Louie, Mr. Edgy.  Well, he gets on NBC, and he picks on God.  He picks on Christians.  But we're safe targets, man, because we're nice people.  And we don't murder people for their opinion.  Hold on a second now.  Not maybe recently.  But let's be honest.  The history has not been good, sir.  I am responsible for my actions.  There you go.  I'll pull up this recently.  I'll agree with that, too. 
[01:45:30]  You know, yeah.  Every time I bring up something, somebody always says, oh, what about the Crusades?  It's like Crusades, Crushmades.  That was a long time ago.  Didn't do it.  Let's talk now.  Okay.  If you're responsible, then you should...  Wasn't there.  Didn't do it.  Fair enough.  Then why are you lumping in all Christians?  How come you're lumping in all people of religion in a good way, but you don't want to take  the negative hit, either?  Like, you're saying we're nice people.  A lot of religious people are not nice.  Anybody anywhere.  What's that?  When did you hear me lump anybody anywhere? 
[01:46:00]  Did you not just say you can make fun of Christians because we're nice people?  Yeah, we are.  We don't murder people.  Oh, so we don't...  Right there.  Let Mr. Edgy get on NBC and talk about Allah.  Talk some trash there.  Oh, exactly.  I don't think he was trying to be edgy, though.  This is something I've said in the past, too.  You're absolutely right, sir.  I think Christianity is the easy religious target to take.  If you make fun of Jews, you could do that if you're Jewish.  If not, you will be looked at as an anti-Semite. 
[01:46:30]  And Islam is completely off the table because they will fucking kill you.  But Louis doing that, I know the emotion that this guy is saying because as a comic,  like, I don't like to be told I can make fun of Christianity and not Islam.  But when a guy actually has a bit about it, just because he's talking about this doesn't mean,  oh, no, Louis couldn't talk about Islam.  Islam for us...  Well, he won't.  Islam for us doesn't resonate the way Christianity does because...  What's that, sir?  Of course, it resonates. 
[01:47:00]  It doesn't resonate.  I'm talking about...  Okay, I'm a comic and I know Louis and I write material.  I'm talking about with us as comedians when we write material.  Right.  So now you're lumping yourself in with comics and you know what the process is.  They were born and raised Catholic.  So I think they relate more to it.  I think they know that if they do Catholic or Christian material, more people will relate  to that than they will if you just start going off on Islam.  And it's something like when you talk about Islam, I am... 
[01:47:30]  When I write about Islam, and I've done...  Jimmy does Islam material.  Almost every special, I've made fun of Islam.  And does Louis?  I'm not sure.  And I have a fatwa after Jimmy.  I bet it's very light.  It's me and D-Raw.  Have you seen my material?  Jesus.  Well, why don't you say something like...  No, no, no.  You're not answering my question.  Have you seen...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Have you seen...  I'm going to joke for you.  Have you seen the material I've done on Islam?  No, I haven't.  Okay, then why don't you just admit you don't know what you're talking about?  Well, I'm pretty sure it's light. 
[01:48:00]  You're still alive.  No, it's pretty...  Let me write a joke for you.  And I would also...  I'm comedy central.  Hold on.  Also, I'm not going to let you throw in a dumb thing.  You're not contributing anything.  You're being like basically an ear troll.  I actually agree with most of all that you've said about Christians button out.  Yeah, that's terrific.  But you're also...  You're implying, because you didn't like what Louis said, that... 
[01:48:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay, you're implying...  Maybe that's not what...  You didn't hear what I said.  For whatever reason.  I didn't say I didn't like what he said.  Okay, and I'm correcting myself.  For whatever reason, you're saying that he should have made fun of Islam.  Like he's edgy.  I'm just pointing out the fact that he's not edgy.  First of all, I didn't use the word edgy like it's 1988.  I said it was funny.  I didn't say...  I was happy he did that on TV, because I understand the rule.  And whether you believe it or not, they really do push back against the religious stuff,  even when it's Christianity.  You can get away with a bit more of it. 
[01:49:00]  But they do push back against it.  You just...  You don't know what you're talking about, dude.  I've written fucking material for television.  I know what they allow you to do, what they don't allow you to do.  Yeah.  Well, you can probably get away with a little bit more on Saturday Night Live.  Well, you tell us.  You would know.  Network TV.  It's after hours.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  There's your one more phone call.  We should take a break here.  Thank you for your service.  Thank you for your service.  I just use these words they heard people say. 
[01:49:30]  It's edgy.  It's edgy.  You're being edgy.  I thought his set was great.  It was.  It was great.  You can't watch someone do a brilliant set and make great observations.  Right.  And then all of a sudden go, why didn't he talk about...  That's the annoying part.  And people will talk about what they relate to.  Yeah.  Now, you could talk about Islam, and many comics do, in the way of how bizarre it is, terrorism. 
[01:50:00]  You could use all that stuff.  How it affected us here in New York.  It's very rare that you'll get a comic that gets up there and talks about his experiences  with Islam, reading the Koran, doing that.  Because we don't, as Christians, as a primarily Christian, judo-christian...  What is it?  Judo-christian...  What do they call that?  Judeo-Christian?  Yeah, that one.  Country.  It just doesn't work.  Yeah.  And when you talk about...  It's like when you tell somebody something about Islam, 
[01:50:30]  a lot of times you're telling them something that they don't think about on a daily basis  or that they don't know.  So you can make fun of something with Islam, but I literally can't...  Like, you know the guy who got in trouble recently for doing that thing about Muhammad?  He did that video about Muhammad and they were outraged.  The actors didn't know what they were doing.  They were just reading parts and then it was put together and that's what it was about with a green screen.  So that should show you how relatable Islam is to people.  If you're going on SNL, how deep do you want someone to go on Islam and just, what, bomb? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, because you would be like, I don't know this.  And as far as worried about getting killed, he's right.  That is one reason.  My issue is not that people are worried about getting killed because I think Islam does react violently.  It's the fact that when people say, I'm not going to talk about Islam, just be honest about why.  Because they're violent when they don't like what you do.  Right.  Be honest about it and say, that's why I don't do that material.  I told you there was one visual I took out of my last special, which I did something about Islamic porn. 
[01:51:30]  But I took out one part of it and I said the reason I did that was because out of context, that one thing,  I was saying, Allahu Akbar, and I was making the jerk-off thing, which made sense.  Oh, I remember that.  But if someone doesn't speak English and they just saw that moment, Allahu Akbar, me jerking off.  Oh, Jimmy gets his head cut off.  I don't think I get my head cut off.  No, we could hope.  But, oh, please, this fountain of ideas.  But I was honest about why I did that.  Yeah.  Because the reaction by Muslims can be very violent. 
[01:52:00]  I hate when networks soft-soap are.  Well, like Comedy Central one time.  You're just going to be more compassionate and thoughtful in our – you're just scared.  Well, they said, you know, in light of recent world events, it's like the language to me is not truthful.  Like, say, like, hey, look, guys with bomb belts run into places.  Just admit that's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't be afraid to say that.  And not many Christians are doing that.  Not many Jews are doing that when they're made fun of or using – but, boy, those Muslims. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, but don't act like Christians have never been violent either.  Like, the history of Christianity is fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  But, again, that's a history thing.  Yeah, I know.  And I really – sometimes looking back too far is useless.  I mean, you should always know the history, but you can't look at things in the context of this day and age and blame or use history as some fucking cure-all or cover-up for everything that's happened in this day and age.  Now, Catholicism and Christianity has had its fair share of abortion clinic bombings and death threats to doctors and actually carrying out killing abortion doctors. 
[01:53:00]  You know, there is some violence there, but nowhere near what you get with Islam.  Yeah, Islam is like – it's like 15th century or whatever it is, Christianity.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it's a younger religion.  Right.  And, by the way, I was talking about slavery.  Were you?  Yeah, that's what I meant when I said take history and just use it as a cure-all for everything.  That's what I meant.  I did not catch that. 
[01:53:30]  We got our next hour.  All right, we'll take a break here.  Where's the plane?  Oh, man, that fucking thing.  CNN will not give up, though.  They keep going back to that same area. 
[01:54:00]  Well, not CNN, I mean, the actual site that they've been searching.  They keep going back.  They see things on satellite.  They see things.  Planes have seen things.  They send the ship over.  What's that?  And then they pick it up.  One thing turned out to be a jellyfish.  Right.  It was a jellyfish.  But what about that large debris field?  Big jellyfish.  Ah, what?  Debris.  How does that guy on CNN say it?  Debris.  Debris. 
[01:54:30]  It's a – there's a large debris.  And a lot of it has turned out to be aluminum.  I'm learning that the ocean is a junkyard.  That's what I was just going to say.  I don't like knowing that.  We've learned that.  I guess in the back of your head you kind of know.  But now, like, seeing it.  Because this is – that part of the Indian Ocean, like –  It's just an area.  It's no man's land, and there's a bunch of junk out there.  Here's what I've learned.  I think if you go into any area of the ocean and search it like they've been searching this area, 
[01:55:00]  they will find a shitload of garbage.  The entire ocean is full of fucking garbage.  It really is amazing.  It just sucks.  You don't think of that because it's – the ocean is so big, you think.  Well, that's why it's – that's how it all started.  I know.  Someone said, you know what?  That ocean is pretty big.  We could dump a few, you know, boatloads of crap out there.  You won't even see it.  And people would be happy.  They don't have, like, a garbage dump in their neighborhood. 
[01:55:30]  Garbage is everywhere.  Fast forward 100 or 200 years, and it is a junkyard out there.  Isn't a lot of the biodegradable, some of the garbage, like the fish will eat it?  No?  I think some stuff.  But, again, the United States is probably on the forefront of ecology in this world.  And we do our best, I guess, to keep from really fucking things up, as good as any civilized nation can.  But you start looking at, like, emerging nations.  China is a great example.  A whole huge country just starting. 
[01:56:00]  Their industry is pretty much where we were in the early part of the 20th century.  They don't give a fuck about the oceans or the air.  No.  It's pretty much like we were back then, because to try to get up to steam with your industry,  if you try to spend money and time keeping it clean and nice for the earth, you're going to go broke.  You're not going to be able to advance as quickly.  Well, they should use steam.  Steam.  That would help the problem.  But this plane, I mean, one U.S. expert is saying, or U.S. official is saying, it's almost impossible to find this thing. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  It seems to be.  But the family need, the families need a shoe.  There still are people that think they're alive.  They need a shoe, yeah.  Just anything.  Is that a person on the plane?  I'm sorry.  I feel bad for those families, because I don't think they're going to get the answer they desperately need.  Not now, no.  And some are saying, is it even, well, they were talking about CNN. 
[01:57:00]  And then, did the plane go in without, you know, breaking apart?  Oh, and just sink?  Is it possible to sink?  Do you mean that he would have to have landed that on purpose?  Like landing it, and then one, it comes down in one piece?  And then what'd he do?  Oh, man.  Then you just let it sink?  Will it sink eventually?  Oh, God, yeah.  It would sink.  I don't think you could hit the water and not put enough breaches in the thing where it wouldn't sink, but...  What if it's completely intact?  I think some wreckage comes up, but... 
[01:57:30]  Somebody would have made a cell phone call.  That's like a movie.  Right.  That's that movie.  Wasn't there an airport, or an airport movie, where it sank, and the people were still inside?  No, it was the Poseidon Adventure Part 2.  No, I swear!  With Christopher Lee.  Yeah, but it wasn't.  I remember there was an airplane, and it sank.  By the way, I watched that goddamn...  What was it called?  Daylight?  That's Sylvester Stallone.  Oh, right.  Where he's in the Holland Tunnel.  That's good, right?  It is so, so greatly bad. 
[01:58:00]  What happened to our action figures?  The ones we grew up with.  His name was Kit Latoura.  Kit Latoura?  Fuck yeah!  I knew Chip would like it.  It's Kit Latoura.  Kit, where are you going, Kit?  And he goes running into the tunnel.  And it was the Poseidon Adventure in a tunnel.  Same thing.  Water, fire, the whole dull schmear.  Hold on a minute.  This guy has a great theory on what happened to the plane.  Elliot in Ohio.  Bill, you have a great theory on what happened to the plane? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Heard every theory.  Because we've heard it all.  We've heard every theory.  We've heard everyone.  How is yours, the great one that...  We don't even need to know.  His theory is probably what actually happened, but we're going to go.  You know what it's going to be?  It's going to be one of the wacky ones that they've just put out there.  Oh, they tailed another plane and missed the radar.  Oh, it landed in the ocean. 
[01:59:00]  It landed on the land.  When did you give up on the story?  I was all in.  A week ago.  I was all in for a while.  About a week ago, I guess.  I completely gave up.  That's about right.  Yeah.  About a week ago.  And apparently everyone else did, because now it's all about...  The mudslides.  Russia, the mudslide, Russia amassing 100,000 troops.  And if the earthquake's going to...  The big one's going to hit L.A.  Big one hit L.A.  And then I guess North and South Korea are having a little fun with some artillery.  No kidding.  I saw that.  They're just blasting off.  But they're such faggots, because they just blasted into the water. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  They don't even go for the land, because they know that would cause some real shit.  So they're just artillery rounds into the ocean off of their coastline.  Off of South Korea's?  North Korea and South Korea are exchanging artillery.  So they're just firing it on an angle, so now it's officially in their water?  It doesn't matter.  If I was North Korea, I would invade South Korea at this point.  Because, obviously, Obama wouldn't do anything anyway.  Not that I even think he should at this point.  I'm just saying that if you're looking to invade an ally of the United States, I would do it now. 
[02:00:00]  Just do it now.  It's like having a substitute teacher in.  You could throw as many fucking wet paper towels against the old chalkboard as you want.  What is it about human beings?  Why are we just such assholes?  I don't know.  We just think we're...  But it's exhausting.  I think we're so self-important.  What happened?  Talk logic.  Twitter the photo.  Which one?  Oh, it's not complimentary for the Oapster.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  But it's a damn good one.  Oh, yeah.  That one.  I saw that one.  It's Opie and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Scotty in... 
[02:00:30]  Hey, I'm in good company.  Fuck, yeah.  Hopefully soon.  But it's in Boogie Nights.  It's fucking hilarious.  Because you're both facing the same direction.  The same, like...  The same pose.  Oh, my God.  Is that great?  All right.  All right.  That's funny, man.  God damn.  You want to kiss me?  Long lost brothers. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, my God.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  I don't understand why human beings are just fucking assholes.  You saw the coming attractions for the Vice Rhino special, right?  Mm-hmm.  That fucking...  Oh, yeah.  That depressed the hell out of me.  You're just sawing off rhino horns.  You like that, Tim?  Yeah.  I like animals, but I always think that rhino massacring is a hoot. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, it's a hoot.  It just gets me.  When I'm depressed, I watch rhino massacring videos to cheer myself up.  Thumb horns.  What was it?  They had, like, a whole table just filled with rhino horns.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's all for that dumb fucking shit that they do in these Asian countries where they  powder it up, and they think it's going to give them boners.  Why can't they just use Cialis at this point?  Exactly.  Come on.  Oh, that poor thing.  And they get lazy, so they just kill the rhino.  They kill him. 
[02:02:00]  Because it's easier to get the horn that way.  When they cut the horn out, does it hurt the rhino, or does it just make them, like,  not able to defend himself?  Well, if I was a rhino, I would accept that over, you know, you're going to kill me just  to take my horn.  No, when you cut off a rhino's horn to keep him alive, you're leaving a fuckload of horn  in the rhino's nose.  Right.  And that's valuable stuff.  And it's a fuckload of money you're leaving behind.  Right.  If you're poaching, I don't think you're thinking about the rhino's health and safety.  At that point, you rip it.  You yank the whole thing right out of his face.  Right.  Didn't Japan just get banned from doing whale research or something? 
[02:02:30]  Did they?  Can we look that up, Sam?  I had something on Twitter.  I didn't read the article.  But these countries...  The Japanese are fucking pigs.  They're the worst.  The way they treat dolphins and whales.  They're terrible.  It's some dumb, ancient fucking bullshit.  Yeah, a U.N. court orders Japan to hold whale hunt.  U.N. court!  The U.N. court!  Who pays attention to the U.N.?  Well, then why don't we do this?  If we care so much about that, why don't we tell Japan, we will not deal with you while 
[02:03:00]  you're doing this?  Sanctions against Japan?  You're crazy.  Just not deal with them.  We will not acknowledge you until you don't do this.  Sometimes you're cutting off your nose to spite your face or your rhino horn because we do  so much business with Japan, it would cripple us as much as it would them at that point.  It would cripple them more.  It would cripple them more because they're a smaller country.  But we can't be...  We're not in a position to be crippled at this point at all.  No, in this day and age, here's our problem.  We don't make enough shit to kick around countries anymore with sanctions. 
[02:03:30]  We are so dependent on so many other nations that we can't all of a sudden go in there and  say, we're going to cut this off or that.  First of all, we're not sending anything over there.  Secondly, we need their shit.  So we can't sanction nations anymore.  It doesn't work like that.  We're fucked.  Let's say hi to Paul from Philadelphia.  How you doing?  Have fun with Sanchez there, Paulie.  Yeah, the dirty one.  Mark Sanchez is now an eagle for a year.  Eagle.  Oh, well.  Sanchez, Vic, whatever.  Hey, when I was in the service, we used to throw all kinds of crap over the course. 
[02:04:00]  Thank you for it.  What's that?  We were thanking you for your service.  What'd you throw in the ocean?  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah.  We used to throw, like, five gallons of paint.  I mean, everything.  Engine parts.  What's five gallons in an ocean?  Right.  Of course.  That's how you think.  And then there's millions of people doing it.  Right.  It's just all the garbage.  No one's around.  No one's looking.  You imagine how you'd feel if you threw a five-gallon can of red paint in the ocean, 
[02:04:30]  and then the next morning you woke up, and the entire ocean had red paint.  What a dick you'd feel like.  What a dick you'd feel like.  You'd feel like a dick.  What else, Paul?  Just pretty much.  You'd just see crates of stuff just literally floating in the ocean.  That's where all the kinds of schools of fish would hang out and just chill.  All right.  Yeah, they like stuff.  Yeah.  It's only up until just recently, cruise ships started keeping their garbage.  They used to dump that fucking shit right in the ocean. 
[02:05:00]  Really?  And, like, bad water, all the used water and everything, they'd just pump that shit out.  Ew.  Now everything has to be reclaimed.  Actually, when you're on a cruise, they show you these little specials on television  of how they do it and everything.  It's pretty interesting.  Did you see the picture?  When you're not drinking.  You see the picture of the Titanic compared to...  A cruise ship now?  Yeah.  And you realize the Titanic was just a tiny little fucking...  I think that picture's fake, though, because there's no way they would have the Titanic  and a real cruise ship from now behind it.  Good point.  Yeah.  Wait, they showed how big it was compared to the current cruise ships. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Is it bigger?  Oh, my God.  You're just saying?  Look, there it is.  Look at that.  That's hilarious.  I can't see.  No, it's the top picture, for the love of Christ.  Do they put it next to the biggest cruise ship that's out there now to really make it exaggerated?  That looks like one of the biggest ones.  Where's the Titanic?  This is the Titanic.  No, the...  Oh, my God.  What?  It's the first picture.  Yeah, the first picture.  Which one's the Titanic on the bottom?  No, the first picture.  And the Titanic is in the foreground. 
[02:06:00]  And behind it...  Yeah, he's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the bottom, I'm saying, under it.  I see that.  But the first picture is all you need to see how much bigger the cruise ships are.  These are much bigger than the Titanic.  Oh, yeah.  I want to go for a week-long cruise.  Of course the Titanic sunk.  They are fun.  I know.  Look at that dumb thing.  Yeah.  The big dumb...  Yeah.  Look at how wide these ships are.  Imagine back then if they saw this.  Now they'd go, like, that's big.  They'd lose their minds.  Let's say hi to Jamie. 
[02:06:30]  Jamie?  Is it Jamie?  Jamie Lannister.  Or they leave off your ass there.  It's James from New York.  Yeah, what's up, James?  Or a Jane gum.  Where's your moths?  The rhinos and the horns.  I had a pretty cool job for a while.  I was a medic on a helicopter in Africa.  Whoa.  And what they would do is...  How many helicopters get sick?  Medic on a helicopter.  That's good.  That's cute to see under.  No, that was cute.  They would find rhinos with horns and then knock them out and have a vet on the helicopter 
[02:07:00]  to take off the horns surgically so that the poachers wouldn't be interested.  Oh.  Oh, so they kind of nip it in the bud.  Wouldn't they kill them for what was remaining of the horns?  No, they just left, like, a little nub, so they weren't even interested.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but you collect...  Yeah, it's probably not worth the trouble.  You collect enough nubs and you got, you know...  You might as well go for enough pee-pee powder.  Yeah, they love that wiener powder.  They sure do.  Thank you, sir.  Let me say hi to Brent in D.C. 
[02:07:30]  Brent.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Brent Muthberger.  Hey, Brent.  Yeah, like the other guy, Paul's called in.  I've been in the Navy for 10 years and you should see all the...  Sell the seven seas?  Yeah, what are you, a village people song?  Put your mind at ease?  Did you join your fellow man?  They have an S5 division and they're in charge of all the trash, like, getting rid of all  the trash.  And the plastic, they melt, but everything else pretty much gets deep sick, they call it. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  All the metal fucking bullshit, all the food.  That's the worst.  Yeah, we pulled into port one day.  Yeah.  We were getting ready to pull into port and just literally probably 30 pallets of just  fresh food and vegetables just right in the drink.  Well, if it's food...  Yeah, I can see the food.  That'll go away pretty easily.  Yeah.  The metal, though.  I mean, the amount of metal...  The metal sinks, though.  It's not like it's just floating up there.  Who cares? 
[02:08:30]  Metal.  Let those weird fish deal with that.  Right.  Let those fish with the light bulbs on their head...  Let those strange fucks clang into that shit with their big, giant teeth.  With their giant eyeballs.  And their fucking giant, useless eyes because it's dark.  Right.  Let them deal with that crap.  Yeah, it's dark down there.  No one's going to see it.  Those see-through fish.  Fucking...  Like one of you guys said, though, it's one bag of metal.  It's not a big deal, but you've been doing this for, you know, 70 years.  Way more than 70, sir.  You know what a lot of metal is on the bottom of the ocean? 
[02:09:00]  Sunken ships.  Right.  It happens.  That's true, too, yeah.  Don't worry about a couple of fucking...  And fish enjoy a good sunken ship, too.  Well, they do.  They make it their home.  Oh, yeah.  Coral grows on it.  It's a miracle.  All right there, Brent.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, have a good one, boys.  All right.  Let's go to Chris in New York.  Chris.  Hey, what's up?  Couldn't think of a Chris.  Yes, I could.  Chris Hardwick.  What is this, Chris Chambliss?  Hello? 
[02:09:30]  Yes, hello.  Hi, Chris.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Anthony, that movie we were talking about earlier, Airport 77?  It was 77?  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  And the whole plane went in?  The plane went in, sunk.  The whole plane went in, yeah, with Lemon and James Stewart.  Oh, James Stewart and Jack Lemon with a pilot and co-pilot?  Okay.  How long were they in the water for?  I don't remember.  I remember seeing the movie, real shit.  Well.  It was into like a submarine movie where, you know, nuts and bolts were popping and... 
[02:10:00]  Ew.  Great news.  We got the trailer.  Thank you, Chris.  Uh-oh.  Go back.  Let's play this for the...  Who's in it?  Jack Lemon.  Let's see.  Try to guess all the stars.  These were...  There were a lot of stars in these.  Jack Lemon.  Something's wrong.  Uh-oh.  Jack Lemon.  Flight 2-3 Sierra.  Who's that?  A private 747.  The luxurious plaything of one of the world's wealthiest men.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm glad you could join us.  I've lost contact with 2-3 Sierra.  The passengers, a collection of the rich and the beautiful. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, man.  He's just not here.  Christopher Lee.  The cargo, a priceless fortune in art.  They're in the Bermuda Triangle.  Uh-oh.  And now, flight 2-3 Sierra is off course.  Uh-oh.  And in trouble.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Their wing hit an oil rig, it looked like.  Yeah.  Why would they be that long?  And a really lousy...  It's stupid.  A really lousy crash sequence.  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  Jack Lemon.  Jack Lemon going crazy.  Told ya.  He used to love going crazy.  Oh, did he love it.  This is Airport 77.  Oh, man.  Nobody is going to drown.  The plane is pressurized.  Have you radioed for help?  That guy.  Radios don't work underwater, but our course has been tracked on radar, and they know exactly  where we went down.  What'll we do?  Calm down.  We'll run out of air for the...  That's Jack Lemon.  An unforgettable adventure.  An all-star cast.  Starring Jack Cole.  Jack Lemon, I told ya.  Brenda the Cow.  Who's that?  Brenda the Cow. 
[02:11:30]  She was a couple hundred miles.  Oh, that guy.  Brenda the Cow.  There's no chance of...  We're all not.  Lee Grant.  Lee Grant.  Christopher Lee.  We're us.  Lee Lee.  We're us.  They're a bunch of strangers.  That's your problem.  Why did they just take off?  Joseph Cotton.  Joseph Cotton.  Olivia de Havilland.  De Havilland.  The old people.  Wow.  Darren McGavin.  Any increase in pressure will crush this fuselage.  I can empty a beer can.  George Kennedy.  George Kennedy, of course.  And James Stewart as Philip Stevens. 
[02:12:00]  My daughter and my grandson are...  Why do they have to say as Philip Stevens?  Yeah, who cares?  Uh-oh, there's water in a plane.  This is Navy Search 5.  Go ahead, Navy Search 5.  I've located the aircraft at Cornett Skibbon.  The aircraft is completely separate.  Oh, there it is.  It's under 10 feet of water.  Oh, there's water all over first class.  I want this to be a first stage alert.  There will be helos, scuba teams, compressors, air hose packages, the worst.  I want this treated exactly like an emergency sub-salvage operation.  Ah.  They're showing the whole movie. 
[02:12:30]  They really are.  There's water in a plane.  The tradition of motion picture excitement.  Wow, the seats are all floating.  Wow.  That's a wet plane.  Airport 77.  More exciting than Airport 75.  Yeah.  What happened to Airport 76?  Yeah, it was terrible.  It was a cycle landing.  More exciting than Airport 75.  What happened to 76?  I'll tell you, I know Airport 76, what happened was they landed, there was a rain delay, and  they went back, and they felt it wasn't exciting enough for the six-hour movie. 
[02:13:00]  Airport 75 with the one with Chuck Heston?  Hold on.  Let's play the trailer for 75.  Go back.  New screen excitement.  We've got to find out why 77 is so much.  No, this one says better than 73.  They're in the air.  Airport 1975.  An all-new motion picture inspired by the film Airport, based on the novel by Arthur Haley.  Arthur Haley?  Automatic new story with a cast of the screen's greatest name.  Ooh.  Jordan Heston. 
[02:13:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Great pressure's dropping.  Damn, great pressure's dropping.  Karen Black.  He's in it.  Yeah, he's in it too.  He's in all of them.  Yep.  I'm going to Salt Lake City.  Gloria Swanson.  Oh.  I love her cakes.  For her TV dinners.  Oh.  Susan Clark.  Oh.  Comedian Sid Caesar.  Whoa.  He's dead.  Oh, he's dead.  Ah.  Warped winning singer, Helen Reddy.  Helen Reddy.  Ready for what?  It's just like the airplane.  This is the airplane bit.  Of your human imperfections. 
[02:14:00]  If you're alive.  This is exactly like the airplane bit.  They all come out and listen to her sing.  Think about us.  Ah, Chuck Heston.  Damn you, broad.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  The kidneys in L.A.  Now we can't have her off the dialysis machine too long.  Cadet's taken off.  There's regular flight 409.  Oh.  Nellis Airport to LAX.  Plane, the big one.  The 747.  The big one.  All conditions normal.  And then it happened.  Oh, no.  Oh, this guy had a heart attack in the light plane and hits Chuck Heston's plane. 
[02:14:30]  Well, it's coming right at them.  Oh, wait.  I think I saw a punch.  Yeah, that was Eric Estrada.  Was that Eric Estrada?  The planes collided.  Starring.  There's a lot of wind in the plane.  Something, yes.  It's a plane, dummy.  He was either dead or badly injured.  Damn.  Oh, my God.  Help us.  Ha, ha, ha.  Stupid broad.  This is Al, honey.  I want you to sit in the pilot seat and do exactly what I tell you. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  You mean the soldiers to fly in the plane?  We're going to have to help the autopilot to make it turn.  Why is everyone squeezing the cockpit?  I know.  How'd they catch up to it?  There's nothing happening.  It's a kid.  Karen Black.  Everything will be just fine.  The only way is to put a pilot into 409.  Yes.  You mean a mid-air transfer?  They're showing the whole movie again, too.  Yeah.  Oh, I did this once.  No, Chip, you didn't.  Yeah, I did.  Just dropped down.  Where's the hole?  It's in the windshield. 
[02:15:30]  Look how bad that fucking...  That's pretty cool, though.  How did they do that part?  They just got two planes.  Oh.  So now you know the pilot's in there and it's going to be fine.  No, he doesn't make it.  Why?  I saw this.  Oh, is...  His parachute gets...  Yeah.  Where's he going?  That don't help.  Why is she...  Get back here.  She's standing on the roof trying to wave him in.  Airport 75.  And they show the plane going in for a crash landing.  I think Chuck Heston gets in there. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think they put Chuck Heston in there and he lands it.  Yeah, 77 is better than 75.  Yeah.  You know what?  75 sucked.  And was there...  There must not have been a 76.  You can't put quality like that out every year.  Airport 84 was great when all the pilots had AIDS and got too skinny to fly the plane.  Oh, this is the original.  Airport.  Airport, big scale in every way, has the biggest all-star cast ever.  Who is it?  Who is it?  Universal motion fiction.  Who's in this one?  But Lancaster's in it.  Dean Martin.

Snowing, the planes taking off.  What's that, that old place?  707.  Oh, yeah.  It was a 707.  The pilot from your flight 45 made a shortcut across the field, and he didn't make it.  But what are you doing about it?  Well, what are you doing about it?  Hey, it's Dean Martin.  I'm your pilot.  What are we doing about it?  How about we get a drink?  How selling any novel of recent years, translated into 14 languages... 
[02:17:00]  Howdy-ho, people.  We're going to fly on a long time.  On the screen and directed by Academy Award winner, George Seaton.  Who?  It has seven stories tied into one.  What?

[02:20:00]  would nip it in the bud now like you can't do anything right without being tied up by the  screwing passengers and taking off after an emergency landing by the fbi  well yeah that was a great i just watched chuck heston a little while ago because we were talking  about malaysian air and it led to that and it led to the airport all right good enough oh that's what  happened hey malaysian air could it have gone down in the water in one piece and sank oh that was 
[02:20:30]  the plot of movies oh there's the trailer jack lemon was in that one and then they said it was better  than 75 so we had to watch 75 and then once you watch 75 you gotta watch the original we actually  had a guy on the phone who thinks the plane is floating in space in space yep i don't think it  could have made it up there sir we would know that by now right with some satellite stuff i would assume  that a a plane that's driven by engines that need air cannot get into space once the air gets too thin  the engines don't work and it comes back down you can't get into space in a plane oh crazy remember 
[02:21:00]  the guy we had on about um he's jumping off uh mount ivers yes in the wing suit yeah somebody  over the weekend sent me a video it's already been done wait what it's already been done by who him  friend of mine it was doesn't look like the same guy but it's already been done but i guess it wasn't  done for a big you know uh network so now he says he's going to do all kinds of extra little things

[02:24:30]  he went through uh chicago um the professionals not the actual course but you ought to watch that it's  pretty cool i have no idea what he was talking about yes sorry did you no i'm sorry i was trying  to figure it out i stayed with it even so i'm sorry i did that i'm sorry i'm sorry i did that  we're talking about malaysian air so i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know what the hell  now i think i think cnn is stuck because now they can't just go away from this all the other news  networks have kind of moved on they they go back a little bit but cnn is still all they've become the 
[02:25:00]  flagship station for this uh thing and you got that knob in the flight simulator he's still in  that thing trying new things and then you got the people stepping on australia all the time yeah and  then you got the animation of the left turn left turn which we know i uh i think eventually they'll  find some pieces of it some ship will be uh going uh uh tugging around out there and chugging around and  uh find something they'll find something yeah and go oh what's this oh look it's a malaysian airlines 
[02:25:30]  cup or a saucer perhaps maybe a fork they got a lot of ships out there what do they do eventually  someone has to make the call like yeah yeah it's time to just go home we really could be using these  ships for other things wow why don't we yeah when did they call it off the search has been called off  oh that's gotta suck yeah and then all the family members will freak out yeah you want your people  found obviously and i get why they're so upset you know of course i watched the show on cnn over the 
[02:26:00]  weekend uh it was a soul survivor and it was a story of four  a soul survivor yeah they did a whole uh show just on that on the first super group asia just  on first super group they call it soul survivor yep pretty smart airport it was uh it was uh four  people that uh survived they were the soul survivors on four separate air air line crashes wow and there's 
[02:26:30]  There's only 14 people in the whole world that I guess have survived.  One was the baby, right?  There were a couple of babies, a couple of guys that were 17 years old.  One was the co-pilot that was actually piloting when it crashed.  And how did he...  I know.  He was the only guy that survived on that flight.  But what if you're on a flight where two people survived and you can't be part of this show?  You can't be part of this show.  Oh, that sucks.  That's pretty impressive, too.  You guys can sit there and slap each other on the back. 
[02:27:00]  What about the co-pilot?  Why was he the only one that survived?  The flight deck got, like, separated from the plane and flung over.  He wound up losing a leg and getting all fucked up.  But he lived through it.  And everyone else died.  And everyone else on the whole plane died.  Where did he land?  He landed, like, I think he was thrown out.  No, he was still strapped in his seat as the cockpit just fucking tumbled away from the rest of the record.  The survivor guilt they talk about is amazing.  Oh, man.  That's the thing that was the whole show.  And this one guy that was 17 at the time of the accident, 
[02:27:30]  and I think it was back in the 80s,  he was contacting all these people and saying,  look, you know, no one's ever gotten together and talked about this.  But survivor guilt, don't you think they should...  There's something they could probably do that might lead them to...  His head's shaking.  He's just talking or something.  I don't know what he's doing.  I haven't looked up once, and I look up at my clock. 
[02:28:00]  Are you helping on the phones?  No, the clock is literally spinning around and around in here.  Not yours, mine.  That's how we feel waiting for you to do this.  Calendar pages.  Did that clock go past 1030?  Oh, yeah.  We can actually go.  I think that's the technicality.  Any clock in the building.  What were you going to say?  No.  Nothing.  Nothing?  That's ruined.  Which clip do you think we're looking for?  I would assume get over it.  Ah. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  They all say the survivor's guilt is something that they're like,  you don't understand until you've been through.  Like, all the pilots, like, even that...  This wasn't a sole survivor.  When they survived that Iowa crash, the pilots...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The one guy, Danny Fish, still cries about it.  He said, do you think...  I just saw that, a documentary on that.  Yeah, it was pretty goddamn good.  He's like, you wonder, why did that nine-year-old die, and I'm here?  Like, the kids that were dead, and you made it?  Was that the guy that was in the middle, working the engines?  Well, yeah, he was in first class.  Yeah.  He was a pilot, and they called him in to help land the plane. 
[02:29:00]  He was actually a check pilot for that plane.  Yes, for the DC-10.  He knew everything about that plane.  That was lucky.  And for the pilot and co-pilot in there to just go, oh, okay, you run the engines, was  kind of an amazing thing, because the engines were the only thing they had to steer with,  or control their altitude.  Wouldn't you kind of, like, you know, get over that, though, for real?  You'd think you would.  I'd go to the beach every year and put some beach lanterns up in the sky for the people  that didn't make it.  You know what you'd probably do? 
[02:29:30]  I would talk, hang out, catch some rays.  Right.  Put a knuckles' worth of lotion on some girl.  We're talking, hang, we're catching some rays.  Catching some rays.  That's right.  Talking, hanging, checking some rays.  Check out the empties, man.  Check out the empties, man.  Man.  You're a fucking dork, you piece of shit.  Who are you talking to?  Nobody.  Oh, the opster I think he's talking to.  Be yourself, you idiot.  You don't think you're being organic?  Oh, God.  Check out the empties, man. 
[02:30:00]  Man.  Check out the empties, man.  Man.  Check it out.  He had a party.  Sure did.  And that was pretty good.  There were only four, you said?  Well, there were only four that they followed, that they showed.  There was some French girl, and with her, I guess it wasn't all that long ago.  She was kind of a little kid when it happened.  And it crashed in the water.  And she was the sole survivor, and had to cling to one of these fucking little something that  float for nine hours as just a kid. 
[02:30:30]  As like an eight-year-old.  She goes, ah, do the ocean.  Yeah.  Would you freak out about the sharks with your legs just dangling?  Right?  There's so many good dead treats for them to go after.  No, that is true.  You would definitely try to get those legs out of the water, wouldn't you?  Yeah.  And then they had another guy that wasn't a survivor, but his mother had died in the crash  that the co-pilot lived through.  And he was kind of talking about his resentment toward him.  And meanwhile, it was a weird situation.  The co-pilot was at the controls. 
[02:31:00]  The pilot had taxied all the way to the runway, and then gave it over to the co-pilot to actually  do the takeoff.  And the pilot had taxied to the wrong runway.  And it was way too short for them to take off.  Holy shit.  And it wasn't marked properly, and the lights weren't on, and there was construction going  on somewhere.  So it was completely a clusterfuck.  And they started rolling down the wrong runway and realized too late, oh shit, we're out of  runway, went right off the end of the runway into a highway.  And that's how they all died?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:31:30]  Because the wing hit a tower and just burst into flames.  All the fuel went up in the wings.  And him being thrown clear of the wreckage is what saved him, because he'd have burnt  up with everybody else.  That's pretty much the fire that got him.  But it was pretty fucked up.  Did he get thrown, or did he save himself?  Saved himself.  Hammer out that windshield.  Oh, yeah.  Let me get out of here before everybody gets here.  I'm fine.  That Pan Am, what was it? 
[02:32:00]  The Pan Am flight was the worst disaster ever.  It was on the runway.  The Pan Am flight was taking off.  Or another flight was taking off, and the Pan Am flight crossed over.  And it clicked.  The Canary Islands crashed.  It clicked, yeah.  The two 747s.  Was it two of them?  Yeah.  Two 747s.  500 dead people.  But they say, you know, it's safer than walking.  Hey, it's the safest form of travel there is.  How about we get rid of these TV shows, then?  You know what, though?  When I'm walking, I could just stop walking for a second.  The second you stop flying. 
[02:32:30]  Walking and talking and catching some rays.  Catching some rays.  Nice.  What are you going to do?  And then I watched the Hulk Hogan.  I don't know how old it was, but it was on a bio channel.  It was the Finding Hulk Hogan.  How old is that?  Oh, is it the one where he talks about, like, uh...  Where he's just wearing the fucking, uh, the Bubba shirts the whole time?  Yeah, I think that's...  It's done very dramatically.  When he talks about wanting to kill himself?  Yes.  Yeah.  So I had the gun.  I was clicking off my teeth, brother.  Yeah.  It's actually a pretty good documentary, because it's...  Where'd you find this one? 
[02:33:00]  It's not the normal fare.  Where'd you find it?  I woke up and it was on.  On what?  Biography Channel.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, they put it together, like, right as he was...  Like, when the divorce and the Nick Hogan car accident thing and all that stuff was happening.  Yeah.  And he was just talking about his depression, brother.  I'd go out and drink.  Yeah, we don't have to see this.  Carry a gun.  But it's done as a, uh...  It's very dramatic.  There's no one asking him questions.  It's not done, like, in a, um... 
[02:33:30]  An up style.  It's very kind of...  He's not cutting promo.  Slow.  No, he's not cutting promo.  He's just talking about himself.  I wish I saw this before he came in.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.  But he'll come back.  He'll come back.  I was thinking the same thing.  It's well done.  Right.  It's well done, but, um...  It's just kind of fucking depressing.  I want to see...  Yeah, brother!  The Hulkster was like...  Hey, brother.  Yeah.  And they show him without his little head kerchief on with his wife, and... 
[02:34:00]  Is he still married to that chick?  Yeah.  Oh.  Good for him.  Good for the Hulkster.  Probably a year or two.  Yeah.  Probably two years old.  It's very well done.  Maybe it's more than two years old.  Maybe it's like three or four years old.  Normally, when you watch those bio channel documentaries or biographies on people, it's all the same format.  They talk to people that know him, but it's very up, usually.  And then they go to the down part.  Yeah.  And they have interviews asking questions. 
[02:34:30]  This is just straightforward Hulk talking.  Definitely checking this out.  This was produced by, like, them.  Like, Hogan produced it.  I assume.  And then sold it to a...  Yes.  Because, you know what I thought?  I was like, this seems, like, very self-promotional for his TNT thing.  Yeah.  For that.  And I think that's what they were going for.  But it was good?  It was good, though.  Definitely.  And I couldn't watch it without thinking of little Iraq crying.  I imagine Iraq weeping watching the sad Hulk moments. 
[02:35:00]  Gay Hulk cheerio?  Yeah.  He would cry?  He would have been crying when Hulk was crying.  Wishing Hulk's crying?  He cries a little in it.  He gets pretty choked up.  Why?  Talking about thinking of killing himself, brother.  Yeah.  I stared in the mirror, and I didn't even look like me.  Thought of all the little fat kids are disappointed.  I took two Xanax, and I was drinking.  And when I came to, I had a gun in my hand.  I was clicking it off my teeth, brother.  Clicking it off?  Oh.  Yeah.  He was, like, just kind of tapping the barrel of the gun off his teeth. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  A Hulkster.  Hulk shot a gun in his head.  The bullet would bounce right off.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that.  True, Chip.  His daughter looks great in this documentary, by the way.  She is so sexy.  She is so fucking sexy, Brooke Hogan.  If you're into big girls, like, not fat or anything, but just a big...  I want to make love to a giant.  How tall is she?  She's, like, 6'2", maybe, 6'1"?  No, no.  She's probably about 5'11".  I love her. 
[02:36:00]  She's tall.  She looks great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe she's 5'10", 5'11".  I'm juicy.  Would you?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd give her a lousy fuck.  You would?  It wouldn't be great?  No.  For me, it would be great.  I would hold those big hips and that nice ass.  All right.  Just blurka, blurka.  Blurka, blurka, blurka.  I'd just do the old tapioca spill.  Oh, God.  She'd have tapioca on the back of her thighs.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  That's good.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Yeah.  Amy Schumer's coming in tomorrow.  Oh, she is?  Yeah, very cool.  Promoting season two, is it?  Yes.  Of Inside Amy.  And also, we got Dominic Gansel coming in.  The cronut guy.  With his new...  What?  Cookie shots?  I think we're doing cookie shots.  Is he bringing a cronut?  He'll do some cronuts.  You know what?  I bet he won't bring them.  Cronut's is yesterday's news.  No, he...  I haven't had a cronut. 
[02:37:00]  I heard he's bringing cronuts, but it's the newer flavors.  Ugh.  I want the one that everyone's bringing.  I want the original.  Cronuts.  I've never even had a cronut.  I had a cronut at E-Rock's Christmas party.  I've had a cronut before.  Yeah, they're good.  What?  What are you taking, Chip?  What the?  From a cronut?  What?  You mean yes!  Who could... 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, what's going on with White Glove?  Yeah, how come I can't get my...  Jimmy needs some White Glove.  What's going on with White Glove, Rolly?  Mickey Mouse gloves.  Huh?  Calm down, people.  Everything will be taken care of.  I got my watch on.  Antix's watch is giant.  Some of that.  No, it's great.  I can't wait for the new watch to come out.  Everyone will be serviced.  That looks very nice, that new watch. 
[02:38:00]  White gloves will continue.  White gloves!  Cheese!  You can't say cheese, you got to say capture.  Yeah, I'm kidding.  Capture!  Capture.  Capture?  Whatever.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  Capture?  Yeah-huh.  Is it on camera mode?  I might not have it set up for that.  What a bust.  You got to go camera mode.  Yeah, you should just be able to say it.  Yeah.  But is it on camera?  Nope.  It has to be on camera, then you can say capture.  They have Sam who's saying bad things. 
[02:38:30]  Not us.  Because we all love the white gloves.  I love white gloves.  I just want to get my phone.  I'm going to die.  Capture.  Hey.  Nice.  White gloves.  White gloves is bad.  Hey, bitches.  White gloves.  Capture.  White gloves.  Capture.  Oh.  There you go.  Bit too.  What happened?  Socks.  What?  Rules.  How many times do you have to say capture?  Well, it's loud in here.  Capture. 
[02:39:00]  Didn't do anything.  Capture.  You got to say it right.  I was yelling it.  Your watch is an asshole.  I know.  You have to tell it twice.  And you can say cheese.  Cheese.  Cheese.  No, I did it.  Cheese.  Cheese.  Smile.  Whoa.  Smile works.  I bet the new watch won't get a camera on it.  You should be able to customize that. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Go on.  Click.  White gloves, Roland.  Yes, white gloves.  What kind of white gloves are we getting tomorrow?  Are we getting Dominic?  Yes.  He's bringing his new spring treats that he's presenting.  Spring treats.  What about the cookie shots?  I had one already.  They're bringing just for the guys, the cookie shots.  Oh, okay.  Why?  How hard are they to make cookie shots?  You can have mine, Roland.  Oh, no.  I already had one.  They're delicious.  Shoot.  It's delicious.  Shoot.  All of a sudden, you cum in your pants. 
[02:40:00]  Shoot.  He has a nice lime bar, which is phenomenal.  A lime bar?  It's like a key lime pie, but it's in the bar form.  Barf?  Barf.  Barf.  When is he going to start making money?  Key lime barf.  He's about the money.  He's about the art.  Enough about not the money, the art.  Enough about, like, you see Cronuts in every bakery now under a different name.  Not Entenmann's.  Not Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  They're done. 
[02:40:30]  Adios Entenmann's.  People don't like their chocolate chip cookies, oh, man.  They're just done here on Long Island.  I love chocolate chip cookies.  Yeah, you do, right, yes.  Get some semen.  And I'm sure they're leaving because of the taxes.  Huh?  What?  I'm sure they're leaving because of the taxes on fucking, in New York and Long Island.  But keep raising those taxes.  Yeah, raise them on up.  Yeah.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Because all these businesses will understand.  They'll stay put.  Don't you worry.  Just keep raising those taxes.  Cronuts aren't as good as Dunkin' though, right?  Dunkin' Donuts, I really like my asshole before I eat Dunkin' Donuts. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, let's see.  I love a good Dunkin' Donut, to be honest.  It's a fresh Dunkin' Donut.  There is no such thing as fresh in Dunkin' Donuts.  They're all hot and stuff.  I like Bavarian cream.  They're cold.  I like a good Bavarian cream squeezed into my asshole.  They're all angry.  I went a little further.  They're very angry, though.  When they get an Astrid Donut, they're like, well, what do you want?  Because they know their product is shit.  A nice munchkin.  How about your Dunkin' Munchkins?  I love a delightful munchkin. 
[02:41:30]  They're like balls with cinnamon.  Oh, you ever have a Dunkin' Munchkin dump?  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  It's like throwing pebbles in the water.  You're going to dry all your ass cheeks off when you're done.  Oh, my God.  I really love a good Dunkin' Donuts.  Can you get Dunkin' Donuts?  Toilet looks like a Busby Berkeley movie.  I would never call it pedestrian people.  I'm bringing Dunkin' Donuts in tomorrow.  Yes!  For everybody.  I can't have Dominic's treats.  I'll recreate the homeless bit and I'll jump on them.  You don't like a nice Bavarian cream donut? 
[02:42:00]  Who wouldn't?  Holy mackerel.  I'll take some.  I want to eat a Dunkin' Donut.  Well, that dumb apple thing.  That apple-filled donut cinnamon.  Oh, that's horrible.  No, it's really good.  No, that's horrible.  And they're cheap and you don't have to wait fucking an hour, two hours to get it.  It looks like the apple monster shit into some pita.  Yes, it really is.  A good, loose, apple-y shit.  You guys should go to a donut plant and get the Thres Leches.  It's the best donut.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Donut plant?  No one knows what you just said. 
[02:42:30]  Thres Leches is called.  A what?  Thres Leches.  They call it the three-milk donut.  Thres.  Oh.  Oh, Tray-licious.  Thres Leches.  Thres Leches.  Thres Leches.  It's so, so good.  Where is donut planet?  2037th, near, right next to Gotham.  There's a Dunkin' Donuts downstairs.  Let's Google this shit.  I don't know how to donut planet.  It's probably one of the best donuts.  Why would you go to donut planet when there's a Dunkin' Donuts across the street from here?  Exactly.  That's why I run away from Dunkin' Donuts.  No, you're going to know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  I do. 
[02:43:00]  No, you don't.  Oh, look at this.  Boom.  Wait, you remember the time?  They've been around since 1994 and they got one store.  Exactly.  They're all brand new and shit.  Or all those stores.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oops.  Remember the time Roland brought in donuts from Doe Donuts and they were kind of shitty?  They stung.  They were good.  They were good.  Donuts.  I don't like anything with stutters in the name.  Doe Donuts.  But these here.  Don't get the Doe Donuts.  Doe Donuts.  These here are phenomenal.  Oh, yeah?  They're beyond phenomenal. 
[02:43:30]  Are they reasonable?  You didn't like the Doe Donuts?  No.  I did not like the Doe Donuts.  I don't remember.  What did that take?  I don't remember the Doe Donuts.  It was as if you'd just fucking take shit and flavor.  So why don't we bring in some Donut Plant Donuts tomorrow?  You got a nice marble frosted from downstairs.  Is it Donut Planet or Donut Plant?  It's Plant.  Oh, Plant.  That's a plant.  Donut Plant.  That's dumb.  Why wouldn't they go with Planet?  What's Donut Plant mean?  What does Donut Plant mean?  What the hell is Donut Plant mean?  It tastes like dirt. 
[02:44:00]  Grow Donuts in the closet?  And look, their graphics suck.  They suck.  There's not one picture of one Donut on this website.  You should have pictures of your Donuts on your Donut website.  I've never been less hungry in my life.  Click on one.  Maybe they show it.  This does nothing for me.  Maybe they show after.  You can't even click on it.  You can't even click on it.  Oh, no.  Look at this.  It's a cake Donut.  Yes.  What the hell is a cake Donut?  I want a Donut.  I want no part of this.  It's like less cake.  There's a hole in it.  Give me some more cake.  How about some cake? 
[02:44:30]  Let me party for this.  I'll bring in Thursday because I don't want to ruin my palate for tomorrow.  Bring in some munchkins.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me say that.  You sound like our Bud Dwyer did.  Wheeling in his Donuts on a palate.  We got JJ in Wisconsin.  JJ.  Oh, cool.  No, it's KJ.  What?  What?  It's KJ.  KJ.  Hey, what's up, KJ?  I was wondering what a Cronut is.  We can have Cronut.  Yeah, you don't know what a Cronut is because the guy makes eight a day and you have to wait  five hours for them. 
[02:45:00]  Yes.  Only available on a one block radius.  And then he watches everyone else steal his invention and sell a shitload.  Yeah.  What is it?  I don't understand his business logic.  It's a cross between a croissant and a donut.  And it's Kronut.  And it's absolutely amazing.  But the problem is he's not making a lot of money off this.  A brand new pastry place opened up in my neighborhood and right there it was the Kronut.  Are they calling it something else? 
[02:45:30]  Something else.  So that guy's making a shitload over Dominic's invention.  He didn't care if he did.  You're right.  I created something called a Cromboli.  What is that?  It's a cross between a Stromboli and a crowbar.  Delicious, but you can also strike intruders with it.  We don't have to wait until tomorrow.  What?  We just go to Crumbs.  It's right down the street.  Crumbs says part croissant, part donut.  Oh, cool.  Go get a Crumbs.  I tasted it and it tastes like my bowl sack makes up my asshole.  Wow.  Yeah, go get the Kronut ripoff from Crumbs right now. 
[02:46:00]  I bet it's good.  What's that, Cheesehead?  I said, hopefully it doesn't go to Chase.  Um, Christy.  What?  Christy.  I don't know.  We're getting some Crumbs Cronuts right now.  Yay!  Huh?  Close one by Benjamin.  Right.  It's just as good.  It's the same shit.  They close the Crumbs down over the other joint or is that...  There's one right down the street.  There's one like across the street on 6.  What was that?  That's Magnolia.  That's Magnolia.  Ah, Magnolia.  Ah, Magnolia. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I like the Magnolias.  I just like the banana pudding.  And I bet they have a Kronut ripoff, too.  What is Dominic doing?  Is he selling these people?  He's smart.  Yeah, he is, actually.  He should.  Because they all took his invention and they're selling way more than he does a day.  They took my Kronut, goddammit.  Maybe they made me.  It's the same shit.  What's that?  It is.  A bunch of sugar and a donut.  You would think they would get some scientist to break down the ingredients perfectly.  It's very close.  No.  I bet you can't tell the difference.  It's not science.  It's just, you know, some dough and some shit. 
[02:47:00]  Exactly.  Some shit.  Baking some stuff.  Yeah, don't worry about it so much.  His takes two days to treat.  He's so fucking sick.  Yeah, he doesn't have an oven.  No, it's just...  That's called OCD.  No, it's called deliciousness.  That's not...  Yeah, but crumbs is just...  I had one.  It was pretty good.  A crumb nut?  No, the crumb nut was pretty good.  I honestly would take a Dunkin' Donuts, though.  Exactly.  You're killing Rollins.  I love a good donut.  Yeah, but think about this one.  Think about a jelly donut from Dunkin'.  I don't like jellies.  I would take a crumb nut over a jelly donut, definitely.  But what about, like, a... 
[02:47:30]  A jelly donut?  Bavarian cream.  I like a good jelly donut.  I'd have to have a crumb nut hot.  I've never had one fresh.  Are we getting a crumb nut before the end of the show?  Yeah.  I do enjoy a good jelly donut, though.  Yeah.  I like the strawberry ones better than the, like, grape jelly.  Don't they have raspberry?  Or raspberry or something.  These pedestrians probably have, like, 50 different kinds.  Yeah.  That's nice.  A variety?  Yeah.  Dominic is bringing his new passion fruit, caramelization.  What?  Cronut.  We're getting a crumb nut right now. 
[02:48:00]  He doesn't need to bring them.  Yeah.  We're getting...  Are we getting one right now?  Yeah.  We're serious about that.  Yeah.  It's just mysterious.  I have a theory.  You do?  All right.  We'll discuss later.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  We just said somebody had to get a crumb nut.  It should be here within 20 minutes.  That's the way it should be.  You want a crumb nut, I'll make you one.  Hang on for five.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait fucking two hours.  It's a box.  My theory is the best theory.  What?  I think you're a pretty accurate theory.  You're ignoring my theory as you guys discuss your theories.  What's your theory? 
[02:48:30]  My theory is not even going for the joke.  I got...  I got what happened.  All right.  All right.  And we're going to have to get there someday.  What happened?  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What's your theory?  Let's all write down our theories.  That's safe, no?  All right.  You know what?  Why I don't have your theory.  Oh.  I love that theory.  My theory's good.  That's a great theory. 
[02:49:00]  That's my theory.  That's crazy.  Anyone else want to throw a theory?  Mine was more of an observation.  What are those?  Those are cronuts from Crumbs.  Let's grab one.  They look delicious.  Look at that.  Look at those.  He's got trays of them.  Yeah, he just makes them by the tray.  That's how easy they are to make.  Yes.  It's super easy to make.  And there's Dominic spending an hour per cronaut.  What are you doing?  Two days per cronaut.  It's called mass production.  Let's go, Dominic.  I can't wait until they just give the recipe out and everyone can make them just as well  at home.  Because it's the same shit.  It's like sugar and Wonder Bread. 
[02:49:30]  Who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  Why is this taking so long?  I can't wait to hear,  Eat my cronauts!  Eat!  Little fucking Pillsbury cronauts.  You just crack open that cardboard fucking tube.  Can we all acknowledge, though, as we continue this bit, because in the end we love the guy,  what assholes these people are?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's not...  I mean, you could get him...  Oh, look at that!  Safeway's got cronauts.  There you go.  Oh, no!  Safeway!  Same thing.  They're in a box like a cheap fucking cardboard box. 
[02:50:00]  99 cents.  And look, they don't even...  And they just put cronauts in parentheses, and they're like, we're good.  We don't have to change the name.  They're calling it Safeway's cronauts.  The croissant glazed cronaut.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Dominic has got to be out of his mind, pissed off.  Keep finding cronauts, Sam.  Okay.  He was.  When I talked to him last Sunday, he was like, he couldn't believe some people.  Safeway is selling.  Safeway's got him.  99 cents.  It's the same shit.  You get a huge box. 
[02:50:30]  What are you saying, Sam?  They sell cronauts at Epcot.  Oh, cool!  Epcot cronauts.  Wow.  So, well, he just, you know, you can't trademark the cronauts.  They asked him, why does he license the cronauts?  And then he can make up millions of dollars.  Right.  And he said he will not do it.  Why?  It's millions of dollars.  What's wrong with him?  No.  He doesn't.  Look at that.  Because, you know why?  Because look at how unsuccessful the soup man was when he spread out and he had 20 locations.  Wow.  That's true.  And the product was just completely killed.  But this guy isn't making any money off his great invention. 
[02:51:00]  Croissant donut.  He was poor as a kid, so money doesn't matter.  In the Disney font, the donut, the D in donut looks just like the D on the buses that you take  around Disney.  And at the end of the day, it's the same shit.  But you're eating it in the happiest place on earth.  It's even better.  It does.  Give him an old dick in the ass, Disney.  Imagine eating a cronaut while watching the fireworks at Epcot.  Oh, that'd be great.  Oh, my God.  And you don't have to wait online for it.  No. 
[02:51:30]  They're right there.  So why don't you come in a box?  Yeah.  Yes.  Get a whole bunch of them.  Oh, that looks good.  Same thing.  All right.  Hold on.  Robbie in Oklahoma wants in.  A lot of questions coming in.  Robbie.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, yeah.  I got a question for Roland.  You know, I'm just a Rube from the Midwest, but what the fuck is a pedestrian donut?  A donut with legs.  Oh, shit.  Pedestrian donuts are like Dunkin' Donuts to him, Krispy Kreme.  Delicious.  Let's just put franchise places.  Something you would eat. 
[02:52:00]  Of course.  Of course.  Secondly, I want to know.  You're not a foodie.  Foodies do not go to those places.  They find those special places that give it a little more care.  I understand.  If that's a foodie, I don't want to be one.  Secondly, I went to Dunkin' Donuts yesterday, and I had the Oreo mint donut, and it was amazing.  That sounds great.  The donut I've ever had.  Roland is rolling his eyes, and he ain't even frontin', yo.  You sound like a bunch of fucking women.  All right.  That's when the chefs crumble up Oreo cookie crumbs, put it on the donut. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, it's when they get the old stale glaze and go, let's throw Oreos in time.  Oh, shit.  Roland, this next call, I don't want you to hear.  Uh-oh.  Is there mean?  Carl on Long Island.  Earmuffs, Roland.  Earmuffs.  All right.  Yo, I skeet Stratton, Vermont, last weekend, and getting gas before I came home.  Little donut case next to the register in a shitty gas station was selling cronuts.  Gas stations.  Who buys food at a gas station? 
[02:53:00]  I can't wait to talk to Dominic tomorrow.  Yeah.  He's got to be out of his mind at a gas station somewhere selling his great invention.  Look at this.  What?  This website's got the recipe for milk and cookie shots.  Oh, that's exact.  That's his new thing.  That's the new thing.  They're already ripping him off.  Yeah, you just make them yourself.  Same shit.  Yeah, what do you do?  You take some chocolate, you make it into a cup, and you have some milk.  Got it.  Why hasn't anyone figured this out before?  It's brilliant.  Yeah, but he's creating something else.  It's brilliant, because you've got the milk, and it sogs up everything. 
[02:53:30]  You do a quick shot of milk, and then you've got to...  But he puts something in the cookie to absorb the milk.  Not to absorb, to keep it from absorbing into the cookie.  Yeah, but it's moist, crispy, and chocolatey.  He should have a fuck you to the pastry world, and his next invention should have just cum in it.  Yeah.  Just cum.  And then people try to copy it.  Right.  Yeah.  Because it's delicious.  Yes.  Seth Rogen had a cookie shot at South by Southwest.  Did he make it himself, or where did he go for it?  He went to Dominic. 
[02:54:00]  Why?  He was there?  Yeah.  Local grocery store in West Virginia sells cronuts, too.  Oh, cool.  How come nobody likes my gurges?  Oh, what was that?  G-U-H-H-R-J-E-S.  I don't care how it's spelled.  I know there's lima beans in it or something, right?  No, there's not.  No?  No.  What's in it?  You take snow peas, and you hollow them out by care, and you fill them with jelly.  And then you place them between your teeth and gums until you have seven or eight, and 
[02:54:30]  then you mash the top of your gums.  This sounds fun.  It sounds like a ritual.  You spit the jelly out, and you swallow the delicious snow pea skin.  Why would you spit the jelly out?  Because it's pedestrian.  Trace in Minnesota.  Trace.  You should just draw a regular.  Hey, Roland.  How's that diet going there, fat boy?  Oh, damn.  Damn.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Uncalled. 
[02:55:00]  Come on.  Comment.  Service your wife because she's fucking other people.  Wow.  Wow.  Shit, damn it.  Why get him a good fantasy?  Indiana, Jim.  In the Indiana gym.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  I'm thinking that, Roland, your palate is not that sophisticated.  Hunter Buck says they blindfold you.  You can't tell the difference between a gas station donut and one of your fancy donuts  from New York.  Whoa.  That's a good one.  Can we do a donut taste test with you, Roland?  Yes. 
[02:55:30]  The occasional cock thrown in.  Let's just go donuts.  Regular donuts?  It could be a gourmet donut plate.  If we give you five donuts to try, you think you could go five for five where they're from?  I'm sure I could tell you which one is the Dunkin'.  Or we could just go, Jimmy, I thought you were going to give me a Dunkin' donut.  You pull out this gourmet donut, Dunkin' donut.  Write that down, Sam.  What?  What was that other place called?  Doe Doe's?  It's Doe Doe Doe Donut.  Doe Doe Donut. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, it reminded me of the scene I hated in Rocky 3.  When he's trying to sing to her and she does it all wrong when he goes, Doe Doe Doe Doe.  And she goes, Doe Doe Doe Doe.  That is, I can't stand, that's one of my worst parts in any movie ever made.  But then I hate when he does it, he goes, No, no, no.  It's Doe Doe Doe Doe.  And she goes, Doe Doe Doe Doe.  Oh, that is so bad.  Can we find that?  That's really bad.  I got good news.  You're sick? 
[02:56:30]  No.  Anybody who wants to make their own cronut?  Yeah.  Pillsbury's got a recipe.  There you go.  Already?  It takes 10 minutes.  A little company called Pillsbury.  Yeah, 10 minutes prep time.  You just get the ingredients together, you make it the same shit.  There it is.  You make your own cronuts.  Well, that little guy's an asshole.  That little Pillsbury Doe boy.  I mean, you're not going to be able to tell the difference.  It's the same exact thing.  Same thing.  You don't have to sit there and wait.  Comment.  I could tell the difference.  Make a fucking trace of them. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  I mean, if you want a donut, you go downstairs, you get a Dunkin'.  Doe Doe Doe Doe Doe.  Yeah.  I can tell you between A Doe, A Donut Plan, and Dunkin', and Donut Pup.  What about Twin Donuts?  It's such a bad part.  God, do I hate that fucking part of the movie.  And I love Rocky 3.  Please find that.  Club of Lange.  And you're like, Doe Doe Doe Doe.  No.  How do you get that so wrong?  Oh, she's an idiot.  There's a Pier Panda, and it's delicious.  Oh, cool.  What?  Great news.  Okay.  I've got the top ten places you can find cronuts in Pasadena, California. 
[02:57:30]  Top ten?  Yeah, yeah.  So there's already just ten.  Yeah.  Pasadena.  Yep.  If you want cronuts...  Ten places in Pasadena.  Wow.  The top ten.  That means there's more than ten.  Yeah, there's just the top ten.  Oh, my God.  You can go to...  We're fucking losers.  This took off.  You can go to Confection Cupcakes, BC's Donuts, Colorado Donuts, AM Donut and Yogurt, France's  Bakery and Coffee, Semi-Sweet Bakery. 
[02:58:00]  I mean, anywhere you need, Roland.  Dominic went to L.A. like three weeks ago, and there's a thousand people in line waiting  for his cronuts.  Do-do-do-do.  A thousand people?  Yeah.  In the morning.  He only had 300.  Do-do-do-do.  Shut up!  I hate that part.  I like when Clover Lang went to the benefit that Rocky was doing.  It was the one with Hulk.  With Hulk, yeah.  And Clover's in a tuxedo, and it just made me think, like, he had to go and get fitted 
[02:58:30]  for that thing, and he's just a crazy...  Like, could you picture him being civil in any aspect of his life?  I need a tuxedo.  Man!  Man!  I want a cummerbund!  Man!  Man!  Measurement it!  Wait, did he...  Sam...  Travis sent you something.  What?  Trav?  I'll just put you here.  Do-do-do-do.  Oh, it turned up really loud.  Oh, no. 
[02:59:00]  What are you doing?  I can't watch.  Do-do-do-do.  Come on, Rocky, you're going to wake the baby.  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  Ah!  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  That's good.  She's retarded in the act.  You don't like this part?  Do-do-do-do.  My people and their hearts.  Do-do-do-do. 
[02:59:30]  Ah!  I wish the roof would cave in on them.  That's just terrible.  Do-do-do-do.  How do you get it wrong?  Who says do in there?  There's four do's, you fucked up.  Do-do-do-nut.  You dummy.  Go drop your kid in the pet store again.  Dumb scene.  Oh, God.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Oh.  What's that, Sam?  Fuck.  Oh.  Look.  Look.  These are the cookie shots, right? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  What can we get them?  You can get them at Cookie Bar Manila in the Philippines.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  With a decapitation.  Pretty great, huh?  Yes.  They're made by somebody with a terrible mustache.  Black hair.  That's why he's got...  For a woman.  That's why he's got to do this right.  This is worldwide.  He knows his cocksucker's out there, so do it right and make your money off it.  Don't let everyone else make money off your invention.  Oh, what an idiot.  Gosh.  Yeah, I mean, there's no reason not to. 
[03:00:30]  If you want a cronut, just go to the closest store.  We're going to have to give him a talking to.  Yeah, but he won't care.  Yeah, I thought it was for the money.  Roland, we've got a very good question coming in for you.  Get your headphones on.  Do-do-do-do.  Jeff in Ohio.  Jeff.  Hey, last week, I think Roland said that Dominic was the fourth best baker  in the United States, so he's behind Dillsbury Doughboy, Chef Boy R.C., and who's the third one?  Enzo.  Roland, he's making fun of your boy.  For your father.  I make a cronut for your father. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, do-do-do-do.  He's an animal.  He's suffering enough.  We use plenty of do-do-do-do.  Yeah.  All good.  Well, no.  The cronut.com web domain was purchased by an online poker website.  It's cronut's poker?  Yeah.  This guy's just losing everything.  He's not a strong businessman.  He's not all a good businessman.  He's very bad at business.  Why do you know how to write it?  Cronut's poker.  Cronut's poker.  How did he not get cronut.com? 
[03:01:30]  It's like some Russian poker website.  Yeah, don't try to get from us.  We will kill you.  He needs a good lawyer, man.  Yeah.  He gets some money on the back end.  We want to buy your cronut, effectively.  It's a little two-star, though.  You can buy the Crazy for Cronuts recipe book.  Cuckoo for Cronuts, they should have called it.  Is that Dominic's recipe book?  No, no.  No, it's got-but it doesn't matter.  It's the same.  It's just that Cronuts are cronut.  His cookbook comes out in November.  That'll be a bust.  Put it off.  He might as well put it off for a while. 
[03:02:00]  Plenty of time.  Everyone's is already out.  Wow.  He's already cronut recipe books.  Why would you buy his?  He's just a do-do-do.  Go to the Pillsbury website.  No.  I hate that.  You guys are crazy.  Do-do-do-do.  Who are these chicks?  I don't know.  Who are the chicks?  Chicks.  I don't know.  How does she get that one-one-one?  Oh, look at that.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[03:02:30]  Dominic, unfortunately, missed out on the Cronuts Twitter handle as well.  Who should have followed Cronuts?  At Cronut?  Apparently nobody.  Let's see what Cronuts says.  Well, yeah.  I mean, it's-  Oh, look at that.  Cronuts is coming to London.  Cronut Mania.  It says Cronuts Mania in London.  I don't think Dominic wants a mania about his product that he can't capitalize on.  Have you tried the Cronuts?  Yeah.  Oh, they're quite lovely.  Yeah.  The barn door is off.  Yeah, it's done.  It's done.  Oh, boy.  There's no getting this fucking Pandora back in.  Mm.  Yep.  But he is the inventor and the creator. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  And he'll be on our show tomorrow.  Yeah.  With delicious treats.  Mm-hmm.  Celebratories.  Well, where's the other crumb crumb?  It's the same thing.  Yeah, it's on its way.  You're not going to be able to tell the difference.  Oh, my God.  Is it almost here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just-  There's no line to get to it.  It's just a matter of her walking to Cronuts, so.  Oh, well.  She'll be here by 11.  Poor Roland and his friend.  Yeah, Dominic's a good guy. 
[03:03:30]  Well, I'm sure Dominic, if he needs a gig, they're probably hiring downstairs at Dunkin'.  He could be a chef there or whatever.  It's probably just a recipe that Pillsbury had anyway.  He worked for Daniel Bold.  He'll never work for Daniel Bold.  Daniel Bold?  Who the hell is that?  Exactly.  No one knows Daniel Bold.  Yeah, I know.  He was a great man.  Right.  Daniel Bold or Bald?  Bald.  B-O-U-L-D.  So why don't you explain him?  Daniel Bold.  He's one of the-  He's a super famous chef.  He has a-  Like Dave Thomas?  He has a restaurant, Danielle, in New York.  Daniel Bold. 
[03:04:00]  He's huge.  Bigger or smaller than Dave Thomas?  It's three Michelin.  All right.  Dave Thomas was up there.  So we ran like a-  Up a tree.  I remember that when I was a kid.  We used to sing that Daniel Boone song.  Besides, who cares what Michelin thinks?  What's your dumb tire people?  Yeah, why are tire people telling us what to eat?  I'll eat at an eight lug nut restaurant.  Right.  Exactly.  Firestone cronut tire.  Is that what they're-  Yeah, we're the Michelin people.  The tire people like your restaurant.  For them.  Right.  Really?  What does fucking- 
[03:04:30]  What does Jiffy Lube think?  You ever have the spicy chicken that Dave Thomas made?  Yeah, he's dead.  That's good stuff, though.  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  Say good stuff.  Do-do-do-do.  Oh.  It's like-  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  You wouldn't sing that with a girl?  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Although mine goes do-do-do-do-do-do.  He's an idiot.  She's a retard.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[03:05:00]  You didn't like that when you saw it?  It wasn't sweet and tender like it was supposed to be.  No.  Oh, look, Rocky's the big fighter and everything, but he could be sensitive.  Yeah.  Yuck.  I like it better when he has the fake nose on in part two.  You're being rude.  Because he can't read.  Because he's a moron.  Yes.  This fucking blithering idiot.  fucking bad fake nose  trying to make deodorant  smells mainly  people are saying that your boy  stole the cookie shots 
[03:05:30]  from Manila  maybe he did  hoping no one was paying attention  I mean it's not like it's like  these original ideas  tell the person here who believes wrestling is real  get the fuck out of here  don't tell Hulk that  Hulkster  oh by the way you got the name wrong of the chef  I think  go ahead  it's not Michelin  French  oh sorry so fuck you 
[03:06:00]  you son of a bitch  big shit lump  this looks like it might be better  just going to Tony's donut house  Tony's donut house  in California  exactly  hey yeah  look you put your chocolate frosting and shit over it  oh my god  that's how it's advertised  just horrible chocolate frosting over it  I bet it's good  that looks like you picked it off the sidewalk 
[03:06:30]  but it takes seconds to make instead of Dominique's  yeah you make as many as you need  mingy  look at the human free samples  look at that's in Indianapolis  perfect  man  look at all these cronuts  amazing  it swept the nation  too late  perfect  shoprite  shoprite  shoprite  wait until Dominic comes in tomorrow  I'm going to tell him  I had one of your cronuts  I mean it's so good that you're signing them  at shoprite  it was just as good as the one I had from your store  and you get two  yeah you get two  you get two cronuts at shoprite  it's only three  it's $3.99 for the two 
[03:07:00]  yeah you wait online for hours to get one  maybe  fuck that  you don't need that  right  because this tastes the same  it's just as good  it says right here  it's from a fresh bake shop  there's a sticker that says  our own homemade  all day  this is going to fuck me all day  I'll be doing anything today  and just start going  do do do do  and go  fuck you Jimmy Norton  I always douche chilled out  at that part of the movie  that's great 
[03:07:30]  let's say hi to Mark in South Carolina  Mark  hi there miak  gentlemen  love the show  first time caller  anyway  did a google search  for my hometown  in South Carolina  for cronuts  and guess what  there's a local baker  that's making them  and they're a dollar a piece  and oh my god  they are delicious  there you go  there you go  see bro  they do taste good  all donuts are the same  it's all the same  it doesn't matter  throw some frosting on it  it's fucking delicious 
[03:08:00]  exactly  and the funny thing is  I don't have to go  all the way to New York  to get some pedestrian  because he has to bogart  his secret recipe  that apparently  anybody can do  it's not secret  it's just a bunch of  Bavarian cream  throw it on a donut  and hand it to someone  wonderful  that's all it is  yeah baker knows  what's in that shit  they just have to  eat it once  this is  throw out the  dodo dodo  good news  my store made a change  just for me

[03:09:00]  how poorly that would  solve  that would be terrible  it looks just like  that does not look  that looks terrible  it looks just like  Dominic  that looks eaten already  yeah  they put jello pudding  in there  you fucking moron  looks like a crabortion  they're fucking  with your boy's recipe  too  they're just throwing  fucking pudding  on top  and calling it  cronut  pudding on it  anybody know what he  fills this shit with  all right  pudding  that don't matter  just put cronuts

[03:10:00]  well  now we're just wasting  time until we get  our cronut  Jimmy you'd help  yourself to a nice  variety pack right  the same thing man  the same thing  someone actually  sent out for a cronut  yeah  wow that's crazy  well  it's not going to  take long  where is she  it's already taken  do we know where  she is  yeah  she's on her way  back right now  she went out together  yeah  what's her name  I have no idea  we call her Becky  Becky  yeah  I don't even know  what her name is  how far is she  I always forget  not far  I mean we just  went to the local  place  crumbs 
[03:10:30]  crumbs wherever  yeah  you get cronuts  all over  cronuts are everywhere  you can't walk  into a donut store  without there being  a cronut  really easy to find  yeah  I'm surprised that  Dunkin maybe  I didn't realize  it was this easy  I thought it was just  a couple places  cronuts for a little  while  one place is using  cool whip  on his great adventure  that's great  in the ghetto  they use fucking  like cheese  Velveeta  oh look at this  because they like the  cheese  yeah  this is in 
[03:11:00]  Korea  Korea  Dunkin Donuts in  Korea  it's got dog meat  it's so terrible  Dunkin Donuts has  cronuts in Korea  yeah  they decided to go  ahead and take it  international  yes  wow  that's gotta be  south right  North Korea  yeah  no not at all  they have cronuts  but they all have  little Kim Jong Un  hairdos  their little hairdos  still in the village  right  Dunkin Donuts got this  going on in Korea  Dunkin Donuts  they're awful 
[03:11:30]  look at that  it's the same shit  though  doesn't that look  exactly the same  look how flaky  yeah that looks  nice and flaky  same thing I saw  you can't deny  the flakiness  of that picture  I can deny  it doesn't look  delicious at all  there's no doubt  about it  that's gonna taste  exactly the same  that looks so dry  how dry is it  I had that  oh that wasn't  it tasted like  Pimpkins  Pimpkins  Apple Files  do you realize 
[03:12:00]  what day tomorrow is  the only day  he won't do it  Jesus  not only will he do it  but there's gonna be  a lot of them  I bet ya  look  my microphone's  on fire  I don't see it  April Files  it's April Files  it's April Files  you don't like his  April Files jokes  April Files  no  they're not  he doesn't understand  what an April Files joke  is supposed to be  you don't just make  something obviously  not happening up 
[03:12:30]  and then say  April Files  you don't think  it's good when my  manager's out with  his wife and her  family  they're conservative  southern people  and they're like  eating meatballs  and he goes  those are moon rocks  April Files  and do they  do they just  look at him  like he's a weirdo  they have no idea  what he's doing  yeah  why does he do it  when no one knows  his wife is  human  of course she is  she's so not 
[03:13:00]  happy with that  April Files  I guess we're going  home without our  cron up there  Sam  yeah what the fuck  way to go  this is good  see that's how  tough it is  to figure out  whether something  is quote unquote  a real cronut  or not  Victoria Beckham  got in trouble  former Spice Girl  because she tweeted  out a photo  of a dozen cronuts  imagine how much  trouble she'd get into  if she didn't have  that E on her name  but she just got it 
[03:13:30]  from some random store  yeah  it wasn't from Dominic  but she thought it was  but Dominic tweeted  her back saying  you were wrong  but exactly  nobody could tell  the difference  yeah they can  how stupid is she  that she thought  she could get 12  an intern went  to go get it for her  like our intern  may never return  yeah let's find out  how far she is  don't con me  where is this bitch  she should be here  at any moment  a couple minutes ago  she was on 50  any moment means  two blocks  five minutes  or six minutes 
[03:14:00]  which is a giant  difference at this juncture  well give her the five  alright who's coming  up here  oh security  let's probably make sure  you guys are safe  what  look at that  she got a nice variety  pack for herself  what  they're awful  chocolate vanilla strawberry  huh  chocolate vanilla strawberry  three different types  on the same tray  perfect  makes it so much easier  they're all pedestrian  I'm so sick  of this already  that was delicious  monut schmonut  I don't even care  when it gets here 
[03:14:30]  no  no  now I don't care  I know  we just want to go home  now I guess  we have four minutes  tell Dominic if he wants  he can come in tomorrow  and bring an Entenmann's coffee cake  oh I would love it  would that be great  Entenmann's  a real one  the original  see if he can find an original  yeah  Kevin Pollack had a tough time  finding the original  but I think Dominic  being a baker  he should know where the  original Entenmann's  yeah in the trash can  that's where it belongs  those chocolate chip cookies  are great though  honestly  they're fucking amazing 
[03:15:00]  really soft  if you go to the bakery  there's other bakeries  that make really good coffee cakes  not Entenmann's  see if Dominic can bring in  some chewy chips Ahoy tomorrow  what's that  I do like a good oatmeal cookie  yeah  oatmeal soft  heat that bitch up  in the microwave  for like five seconds  can he bring some Oreos tomorrow  double stuff  why  I'm not sure  I don't like the double stuff as much  why not  because I'm a bigger fan  of the cookie part of the Oreo  than the cream  that's like a nerd thing though  no it's not  it's not

[03:19:30]  and Cool Whip  I'll be honest  that cronut was not good  it was awful  it needs to be  it needs to be infused  with some Smucker's Jelly  how do you eat  a pastry kind of a thing  and just have an awful taste  that was  that was beyond shitty  that's confectionery shitty  I gotta eat  a goddamn saltine cracker  to get that taste out of my mouth  yeah  because all it is  is they just pile on the dough  and then they threw  a pound of sugar  trying to make it flaky  they've done something horrible
