<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about Roland, the show's guest booker.  Opie recounted a positive interaction with a high-ranking SiriusXM executive who praised Roland's improved guest bookings.  Despite this, Opie highlighted Roland's persistent anxiety and self-deprecating habit of using the phrase "dick in the ass."  This transitioned into a discussion about a YouTube video Opie posted – footage of a man in an electric wheelchair singing karaoke in Philadelphia – which unexpectedly went viral.  Opie, despite posting it to his own channel, expressed discomfort with the unexpected attention.

Listener calls followed, driven by a giveaway of Henry Winkler-signed books (one about fly fishing, the other about a child and a ghost). Opie explicitly linked the giveaway to increasing call volume, framing it as a strategic move to improve the show's standing within SiriusXM.  The conversation then bounced between several topics, including the upcoming appearance of Donald Trump Jr. as a guest host,  Henry Winkler's surprisingly kind and unassuming personality in contrast to his on-screen persona, a children's song about body parts, and the hosts' opinions on their coworkers and the dynamics within their show's staff.  The show also touched upon the complex relationship dynamics between the hosts and staff. The broadcast concluded with a commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers and a tease of a forthcoming stunt involving Emmy Rossum from *Shameless*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You know, without getting into too many details...  Sam, I got five minutes. I know you were about to intro me.  I got five minutes to do a lot of shit right now, okay?  You've taken on the task of rolling life coach.  You saw that?  Yeah.  Whose job am I taking?  Well, we all quit. 
[00:00:30]  We all tried.  I know, but...  I assigned Troy to it. He quit. I assigned Sal to it. He got fired.  I'll try.  I used to hang out with Roland a lot because he lived two, three blocks away from me.  And then, you know, he couldn't afford to live where he was anymore.  And he had to, like, move somewhere weird.  I don't even know where he is because he hasn't invited me there yet.  But yesterday in the hallway...  Because Roland thinks he's...  Roland thinks everyone thinks he's doing a shitty job  and that he doesn't do enough for SiriusXM and the Opie and Anthony show.  He doesn't handle the stress well. 
[00:01:00]  He's worried about them thinking about this.  And I try to tell him, like, when we were sitting in our meeting the other day,  Steve Blatter was praising him, saying, wow, he's really up to guests  and really, in that area, the show has never been better.  Just look at today.  And I tell Roland that the boss tells me this.  Right.  And it goes right over his head.  Then yesterday we were in the hallway talking to this guy that's really fucking big in the company.  And he said to me...  Bigger than Blatter?  Way the fuck bigger.  Wow, Roland. 
[00:01:30]  That's pretty good.  Like, Blatter's halfway up the ladder compared to this guy I was talking to yesterday.  It's really specific.  And he looked at me and he goes, you know, you and Anthony,  you're one of the most important shows here at SiriusXM.  Yeah.  How many times have we bitched that we don't feel that?  Many times.  But this guy is so up there on the ladder, I went to myself, you know what?  How about you fucking take that to heart and bring that home with you today?  You're okay.  That made you feel a little better.  Way better.  Okay.  But in that same exchange, when he wasn't giving the finger to somebody, very... 
[00:02:00]  Who?  I can't say.  Which person was giving the finger?  That's got to be a blind item for now.  Okay, but the big...  This guy who's saying how important we are might have been...  F you and somebody else.  Oh, yeah.  Gotcha.  Okay.  And it wasn't a little show like the morning mashup.  But that's a...  So, in the same exchange...  But that's a blind item.  It's a blind item for now.  Okay.  And this, for now, everything always comes out.  We don't just...  We T-shit, yes, but in the end...  Eventually.  We let it all be known.  You'll just say the name of a show and everybody will know. 
[00:02:30]  So, in the same exchange, Roland happens to be just...  Kind of on the outskirts of this discussion that was happening in the hallway.  Yeah.  Because, of course, he had some guests that he wanted to, you know, run by me.  This guy, who's very powerful, was saying how great the guest bookings have been.  And that, you know, it makes his job in the company a lot easier.  That's got to give you some comfort, Roland.  And then Blatter goes, yeah, he's really doing an amazing job. 
[00:03:00]  So, I looked at Roland, and I'm like, will you listen to this shit?  Because he's always worried about getting fired.  They'll fire me for this, they'll fire me for that.  He constantly has anxiety, stress, sometimes tears in his eyes, the famous dick in the ass  that he always has to say to you on this hour.  Yeah, that's his catchphrase.  It's his catchphrase.  And I'm like, will you take that with you?  Because it's going to make you sick.  It is, because it's not an exaggeration.  It's not like he's doing a character when he's saying dick in the ass.  Everyone has said how great of a job he's doing, but for some reason, I don't think he wants  to feel good about himself for some reason. 
[00:03:30]  Well, it's even clear to the listeners, like, it's such a black and white issue.  It's like, before Roland, the guest caliber was on one level.  Right.  After Roland, the guest caliber is on an entirely different level.  Right.  Like, and that's all there is to it.  Like, that's the job.  So, yeah, I get that there's going to be frustrations, and you're going to think the boss  hates you here and there, but you also got to listen to the positive stuff, Roland.  The positive stuff.  Then, guess what?  You won't have to do as many pizza parties to make yourself feel better.  I'll celebrate tonight with wings.  Okay, wings.  All right. 
[00:04:00]  Well, no, baked wings from Rub.  They're delicious.  All right.  Low calorie.  But that doesn't mean you're slack.  You keep doing the same job day in and day out.  Oh, yeah.  But you got, you got, you know, some people talking highly about you the last couple days.  All right.  Before you go, I got to hear about the video, because I was watching the video that you put  up yesterday.  What's on your YouTube channel?  Opie Radio.  Right here?  No, that's a Bruce Springsteen video that you just put up, Roland.  Look, this is very awkward.  I don't like all this attention. 
[00:04:30]  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  I don't like being in the spotlight.  It's awkward.  I want to help Roland out.  Next thing you know, you're promoting something I did.  It's not important.  You're a public figure.  No, I'm uncomfortable with the attention.  I don't think that's true at all.  I don't want to be a YouTube star on the Shorty Awards.  Then why'd you mention it just now?  Nobody brought it up.  Because I figure if I mention it, then the people will finally understand my request,  and they'll stop voting for me.  Everybody's...  I'm very uncomfortable.  And what do they have to do to vote for you?  I'm very uncomfortable.  What do you not want them to do?  Don't vote for it.  On the Shorty Awards? 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  Oh.  I can see right...  Because that means I have to leave my house and get, like, maybe a tie.  Yeah.  I don't show up in public often.  Well, me and Ann are going to be there, because right now we're number one.  We'd love for you to join us if you would stop this false modesty charade.  I'm very uncomfortable.  Well, this video that you put up.  Very uncomfortable with the attention.  What video?  Why are we talking about this video?  Why are we talking about this video?  It's about Roland.  No, no, no.  I wanted to...  Because you said you were going to go.  Right.  So I wanted to ask you before you left.  The electric wheelchair homie...  It's back in the game.  Singing karaoke. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  On the Opie Radio YouTube channel.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's back in the game.  It's back in the game.  Big, big.  With a big story.  It's a big laugh when he appears, right?  Yeah.  It's this guy, Opie or whoever, is filming from the car.  My brother-in-law, AJ, down there in Philly, he was in the ghetto.  And you could just hear this music playing.  Yeah.  And it's whenever you need me.  I'll be there.  And at first you're like, what is this, like a really bad version on the car radio or something? 
[00:06:00]  Right, right, right.  And the music, you can hear it getting louder.  And all you see on camera is just a street.  Right.  And it's not focused on the guy.  And then the guy just...  Drives past.  Drives by the camera.  And it's a guy, it's a black guy in his electric wheelchair with a karaoke machine on the back.  Who's just driving down the street, not the sidewalk.  Driving down the street in his electric wheelchair.  Singing.  Singing.  Whatever you need.  And I thought it was just a speaker.  But then, I guess he's well-known in Philly. 
[00:06:30]  And it turns out it's a karaoke machine.  It's a full-on karaoke machine.  A full-on karaoke machine in his electric wheelchair with a microphone and speakers.  And all he does is just tool around singing.  And at the end of the video, this is where my brother-in-law kind of blew it.  Yeah.  A white van almost takes him out.  You see him fucking jam on his brakes?  I was noticing that, but then I also noticed...  Very subtle, but you've got to watch closely.  At the very end, it looks like the guy jams on his electric wheelchair guy just pulls right in front of him anyway.  He won't let him go.  No, no, this fucking guy is not stopping for nobody. 
[00:07:00]  And he won't even stop his song.  Like, he won't go, oh, he'll just do whatever you need me.  Yeah, AJ's the man.  My brother-in-law, he sent it to me yesterday.  And then these idiots, because it's in the description.  Yeah.  I made an exception.  I fucking hate videos that are filmed in portrait mode.  But this one works.  The quality...  Because now people are like, hey, asshole, you were just talking about how you hate portrait,  and now your latest video is in portrait mode.  No, I got it from my brother-in-law.  And, you know, unfortunately, it's not in landscape. 
[00:07:30]  But the content makes it worth putting up with.  Yeah, but I, you know...  But you've got to...  I mean, he's your brother-in-law.  If anybody should know how to make a video, I mean...  This is very uncomfortable.  I feel like I'm whoring myself out, Sam.  Then how come you were just describing the video?  I just feel uncomfortable now.  You've got to teach your brother-in-law how to make a video, though.  Yeah, please don't go to my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  Why'd you mention what it was?  26 million views and counting.  But different...  It's uncomfortable.  It doesn't seem uncomfortable.  It really is.  What's uncomfortable is this whole charade. 
[00:08:00]  This whole...  The false modest OP character.  I don't know what you're talking about.  That's what's uncomfortable.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Can you get the spotlight off my face?  I'm not comfortable in this situation.  As you say next to the wall with your name and giant letters on it.  The name OP is gigantic on the wall next to you.  I didn't ask for that.  I asked for a place to hang my coat.  The next thing I know, the whole fucking studio has her name.  How many times do you think?  It's literally two feet by one foot.  OP!  Yeah, but that's...  How many of those? 
[00:08:30]  Okay, one, two, three, four.  Four of those.  And then small ones scattered throughout.  One, two, three, four, five, six, twelve.  About 20.  Yeah.  More than 20.  Like you're saying about 25.  And then it's lining the glass.  OP, OP, OP, OP, OP, OP.  Every mic flag either says the virus, which is not accurate.  Make sure you say OPN, Anthony.  I'm just saying, Anthony doesn't pretend he doesn't want it to be in the spotlight.  Anthony wants the Shorty Award.  Sam, there's no spotlight, just bad lighting here. 
[00:09:00]  Maybe that's why you're uncomfortable.  I'm fair.  Because of the awful gel, the jaundiced gel that it shoved.  I didn't get into this business for this type of attention, Sam.  Yes, you did.  It's uncomfortable.  If that were the case, you got into the business to be air talent.  Huh?  Yeah, I didn't think anyone actually would pay attention.  Then why would you want to be air talent?  Because I got free records.  That's all it was.  And there were records back then.  You got into the, I thought you were a child of the 80s.  And now there's all this uncomfortability.  I'm not good with this type of thing.  You just stumbled into this. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  This was also, it's not something you worked towards.  Look, man, please don't make this latest video viral.  That would be very uncomfortable for me, my family.  I bet it would be.  I bet AJ, your brother-in-law, would probably be really broken up about it.  Uh, no, he would love the attention, to be honest with you.  It really is a good laugh.  Huh?  It really is a good laugh.  What is?  The guy, when he rolls down the street, just singing his song.  But now you're talking about the video again.  Yeah.  How do they find that video? 
[00:10:00]  I don't even know.  It's on your YouTube page.  You know goddamn well how they find the video.  Why would you mention it?  Because you just asked me how do they find the video.  Oh.  OB Radio on YouTube.  All right.  Vote for OB Radio on Twitter for YouTube Star for the Shorty Award.  No, please don't.  We want him to join us.  Please don't.  Right now he's in 10th place, and he's feeling bad about himself.  So the false modesty thing.  I'm not joining the table with you and everybody else.  It's going to be a fun time.  Yeah, but I, and then, what, all eyes are going to be on me and stuff? 
[00:10:30]  All eyes are going to be on us.  That's why.  That's why I picked radio.  Because you don't.  Figure it out.  You just want people listening to you.  Yeah.  You don't want everybody looking at you.  No eyes.  Think about it.  So you prefer not having a visual element to the show.  Yes.  You like that.  Yes.  Yeah.  Now, is there any reason now, I get that.  Look, I think.  So then you went out, but you went out of your way for no reason.  Right.  To start a YouTube channel where you would put, many times, you've pointed the camera back 
[00:11:00]  towards yourself.  Well, they got to know who's making the video.  Well, then why would you start the channel if you didn't want the attention?  The channel's called Opie Radio.  See?  Once again, radio.  Once again.  Radio means no eyes on Opie.  Once again, Opie.  You have a segment called Opie's Eye.  I didn't do shit.  Opie's Eye.  Yeah.  Idiot.  Yeah.  Not listeners' eyes.  Opie's Eye. 
[00:11:30]  That means I see shit if they don't see me.  You don't want the attention on the listener.  You want the attention on Opie.  No.  It's videos that I see through my own eyes.  And you just have to share with everybody.  Dude, if I really wanted the attention, I would have made the channel name Look at Me.  YouTube.com Look at Me.  That's a horrible name for a channel.  But that's what I would have done if I wanted the actual attention.  It's not a very clever way to get attention.  You're not a good thinker.  All right. 
[00:12:00]  Jay in Huntington says, unlike the wheelchair guy, this video has legs.  It does?  You get it?  What has legs?  The video.  What video?  The one that you filmed on your dumb YouTube channel.  No one likes me.  My pressure roll.  Rolling.  Everyone thinks I suck.  You like having Opie as a life coach?  Dick in the ass.  Blueberries.  Oh, he got your back.  I'll fucking throw these blueberries at you.  Yeah, that's great.  All right.  Well, you did a great show today, Opie. 
[00:12:30]  Have a great day.  Roland looks like he's going to follow you out to pitch guests.  Is that what's going on?  No.  Did I hear right on Twitter, Roland?  Donald Trump Jr. is filling in for Jim tomorrow?  That's huge.  Yeah, we're psyched about that, Sam.  It's very exciting.  Yeah.  I mean, I know Celebrity Apprentice.  Goodbye, Opie.  Goodbye.  I'm sure, Roland, you'll be back.  I know Celebrity Apprentice is coming on soon, next month.  And yeah, Donald Trump Jr. usually, this is unprecedented.  Usually a comedian will come in or whoever. 
[00:13:00]  But this time, Donald Trump Jr. is going to be on tomorrow doing the whole show, filling in for Jim.  I don't think he'll be there right at 6 a.m.  Because let's face it, he's a millionaire, and so is his father.  But he will be, I don't know what time he'll be on, but he'll be on for most of the show.  Henry Winkler was on today.  And he really is.  Like, the striking thing about Henry Winkler, can you pass me that pad and that pen and that bottle? 
[00:13:30]  All three things.  And this, and this.  Great job, Eric.  And not E-Rock Eric.  The intern Eric.  Great job today.  I have everything I need in front of me now.  And it's all thanks to you.  Anyway.  Henry Winkler is not, like, he's one of the few guys who's impossibly nice.  And that's how he is off the air, too.  Like, he's this, hey, I'm the Fonz guy on TV, right?  You've all seen him before.  His leather jacket with the collar pulled up. 
[00:14:00]  But, like, you meet him.  And I walked by him before he came on the show, and it was, hey, man, how you doing?  And he looks at you right in the eyes as if this is the most important conversation of his life.  And he goes, I'm doing well.  How are you?  Well, I guess I didn't think of it on that level.  I think I'm doing all right, but I don't know.  We didn't, I mean, we touched on it, but we didn't really bring it up.  It's Henry Winkler's history with the show. 
[00:14:30]  A few years ago, during the K-Rock days, we uncovered, I think it was thanks to the Laszlo show.  Is that right, Travis?  Did Laszlo first uncover the Henry Winkler PSA?  Sure.  You'd have no idea.  Not a clue.  But it seems like that would be correct, right?  Yeah, he's found so much good stuff before that we've used.  Well, Laszlo does use the internet.  That's true.  Laszlo from Rockstar Games.  I think it was him.  Yeah, I think it was, too.  Who found the PSA.  Do we have it in the system?  Just the PSA? 
[00:15:00]  No.  All right.  I mean, Sex Man might have it in his vast archive.  Yeah, but the Sex Man is not here today.  No, we are sans Sex Man.  Sex Man is all sexed out.  Mars, see if you can find, maybe on YouTube.  This is a good exercise.  Henry Winkler PSA.  I would say write it in Spanish, but you don't know that language.  Henry Winkler PSA.  There it is.  Strong kids, safe kids.  What is it for me? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, let's click it.  This is, you can just play it.  This is the Henry Winkler PSA that's been played so many times on the show.  Hey, would you listen to that beautiful chorus of voices?  Thanks, kids.  And now I'd like you to meet a very good friend of mine.  We're almost flushing.  I don't think the kids are really there.  Mr. Henry Winkler.  Hey, take a bow, Henry.  Hi, I'm very glad to see you.  That is how he is, too.  And I'm very glad to see you.  And I'm very glad to see you. 
[00:16:00]  So let's take charge.  Hey, you're cool.  Huh?  So here we are.  Parents and children together.  It's just uncomfortable to be that nice of a person.  Like, maybe it's just because I'm not.  But there's something that, like, if I were to act that nice, I would feel so disingenuous.  And I assume that that's how everybody feels when they're acting that way.  And you know who's just as nice as him?  Who?  D.L.  Yeah, but D.L., like, at least he's kind of the way he is on stage. 
[00:16:30]  Like, Henry Winkler just completely, he's not the guy on TV whatsoever.  In the best possible way.  Because the Fonz is awesome.  Hi, me too.  John Ritter.  John Ritter's in this.  And some black woman's yelling.  I don't know why.  But, like, D.L. is like he is on stage.  Whereas Henry Winkler is like, he's like the Fonz's nice grandpa who taught him everything.  Tallywhacker.  I think this is the song coming up. 
[00:17:00]  Penis is what boys have down in front.  Penis is the word, though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis.  So no matter what you've heard, remember that penis is the proper word.  Vulva is what girls have down below.  Even though most people call it vagina.  Who the fuck is that guy?  We call it Virginia.  Penis is naked.  It will show all girls have a vulva.  So no matter what you've heard, remember that vulva is the proper word. 
[00:17:30]  Our anus is a useful thing indeed.  The anus gives relief in time of need.  We all have an anus, so no matter what you've heard, remember that anus is the proper word.  So don't be appalled, because that's what they're called.  And each of them's the proper word for private parts. 
[00:18:00]  Now, that wasn't Henry Winkler that was singing the song.  He was just some weirdo in his video.  But regardless of whether being nice is a legitimate thing or not,  is there anybody who could have been part of this production  that didn't think that that song was going to be simply a tool used for humor?  Like, even a little kid who says anus instead of butthole.  Like, that's a funny little kid.  Like, Marge, how old is your youngest?  My youngest is four.  So that's perfect.  This is probably what this was aimed for. 
[00:18:30]  If your four-year-old walked in and said,  Daddy, look at my anus.  Wouldn't that be some funny shit?  I guess so.  You'd be like, that's a funny kid.  My kid's going to be a comedian.  Anus.  Whereas he said, like, Dad, this is my butthole.  You'd be like, yeah, obviously.  Right.  But if he was like, Dad, this is my anus.  You'd be like, that's hilarious.  That's true.  Fonz is in this.  Well, it was good having Henry Winkler on.  And Roland actually, Travis, I saw Roland did not get your picture signed. 
[00:19:00]  Well, he'll be back.  I hope so.  I mean, he is here.  He's here a lot.  Yeah.  But what we did, I think there was some confusion.  I think Roland thought he was signing it.  I don't know what Roland's thing is.  But what did get signed was a couple of books.  And, Travis, you can't have either book.  You know what?  What?  I don't want one.  Well, you can't have one.  Good.  I don't want one.  Well, you can't have it.  I want one now.  What are you going to do with them?  Well, there's the one book about fly fishing.  That's for adults. 
[00:19:30]  And then there's the book about a kid who's friends with a ghost.  That's for kids.  Uh-oh.  Hotline.  Hello.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam, I feel very uncomfortable with all that attention you just gave me.  So, Opie, why are you calling into the show?  I just feel extremely uncomfortable with all that stuff we talked about.  So then why do you want more?  We had moved on from it.  I know, but I just am sitting here in the car thinking that it's not the position I really want to be in.  You understand by calling in you're just putting more attention on yourself. 
[00:20:00]  No, I just want to make sure that people understand that it wasn't me.  It was really you just pushing.  And now I just don't feel good about myself.  I feel very, very used, like I was whoring out.  Well, like, what's the most, what makes you most uncomfortable that was happening?  Well, when you mentioned the guy in the electric wheelchair in the Philly ghetto singing karaoke, I was very uncomfortable with that.  Where?  Like, where would, where do we see it? 
[00:20:30]  See, you're doing it again.  You're trying to make me, you know, say Opie Radio on YouTube.  And I don't really think that's right.  With that time you just said it.  Yeah, because you're, you're forcing me to do the point I'm trying to make.  I'm just completely holding you against your will.  I mean, all I did was answer.  You asked me the question.  Of course, I'm going to answer it.  Right.  And I know why you're doing it.  Because you know I feel uncomfortable doing this.  So you're trying to get me into my uncomfortable state again.  You called me. 
[00:21:00]  What?  You called me.  I didn't call.  No.  I, explain it again.  I called you because now I'm thinking about it and I realize it's just not right.  And I felt very uncomfortable with all the attention that you gave me.  Well, like, did the Shorty Award thing make you feel uncomfortable?  Uh, what, what Shorty Award at all?  You know, like, nominating you for a Shorty Award for YouTube star.  I don't know if we lost him or if we lost him. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, well, I'm sure he'll call back because he's feeling very uncomfortable.  Um.  Oh, I'm sending Travis Pitcher to the publicist.  He's going to get a sign.  Oh, you are?  It's fine.  Don't worry about it.  That's very nice.  Yeah, see?  Although, I mean, yeah, Trey, he will be back.  I mean, you can just, I don't know, do whatever you think.  But we do have one of his.  What if he dies?  What if he dies?  I hope he doesn't.  My bad.  If Henry Winkler dies before he ends up back in this building, then God doesn't exist.  Because there's no way that a guy that nice should be dead at this age. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  He's got so much life in him.  And he's written 19 children's books.  Who would take the time to do that?  I would never.  Let's talk to Chuck.  Chuck, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Chucky.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  What's up, buddy?  I love your after show, buddy.  They call it a shit show, but I just got to call it a great show.  Thank you, Chuck.  That's right.  Suck up the fam.  Let me, let me, let me ask you.  That's exactly what everybody should be doing.  Let me ask you this, Chuck.  Do you prefer ghosts or fish? 
[00:22:30]  Uh, I'm trying to, I call him to get the ghost book for my daughter.  She's 12 years old.  She loves to read.  I'm sure she'd love that.  Well, I just got a text, Chuck, from Opie.  He texted me on my personal cell phone.  And he just wrote, very uncomfortable, with four exclamation points.  I guess the YouTube plugs made him very uncomfortable.  Oh, you gotta plug Opie Radio on YouTube.  Oh, Chuck, you know that's not gonna make him, not gonna make him happy. 
[00:23:00]  At all.  No.  Um, all right, well, Chuck, I like you very much.  Uh, and Roland, this is a signed copy of the book?  Yeah.  Let me see.  It's called, uh, Ghost Buddy, and if you want, if you want a signed copy of the book  and you live in the area, uh, go meet him.  He's a legend.  Henry Winkler is gonna be at Books, Bites, and Beyond in Glenrock, New Jersey, today at  4 p.m., um, and he'll be signing copies of Ghost Buddy, and you can go and shake his 
[00:23:30]  hand and tell him you enjoyed him on, uh, Opie and Anthony.  But, I'm assuming, Chuck, that your accent doesn't really sound like a New Jersey accent.  No, not New Jersey or New York.  I'm from Ohio, and I'm one of your truck driver listeners, and I'm down in Texas right now.  All right, well, I'm gonna put you on hold, because we're gonna send you an autographed  copy of Ghost Buddy, and the inscription, I'm just reading it, Henry Winkler, he signed  his name, he dated it, and you know what, Chuck, I think he meant this for you, you know  why?  Why's that?  Because the inscription says, you are powerful. 
[00:24:00]  And I feel that way about you, Chuck.  I'm gonna send you this book, hold on, okay?  Thank you, Sam.  All right, buddy.  Winners every day.  Winners every day.  When, what's that over there?  Tight lines.  Tight lines.  About the fishing?  I guess, but I don't know, is that some kind of weird double entendre type thing?  I don't know, this is a very dark side of Henry Winkler.  That is the fishing book.  So this is Ghost Buddy.  It's also in stores, and that's what he's gonna be signing today in Glenrock, New Jersey. 
[00:24:30]  Line 9.  From 4 to 5 p.m.  Line 9's not a hotline.  Oh.  Nope.  I don't have to give away.  You like Line 9?  Yeah, too.  We'll give him the book.  Because you want to give Line 9 the book.  Yeah.  Or we'll just see how he is.  Yeah.  The other book, what's the name of the book, Roland?  There's this one, and this fishing one?  Yeah, what's it called?  I never met an idiot on the river.  I never met a what?  An idiot on the river.  That's right.  I never met an idiot.  Until I bumped into Master Poe.  Why do you always say Master Poe?  He loves that guy. 
[00:25:00]  Um, lucky you, Kurt.  Hey, is this the actual Sam Roberts I'm on the air with?  That's right.  Oh, I am a lucky, lucky man.  And I am lucky to be talking to you.  You're not Kurt Love, are you?  No, no, sadly, I'm not.  Oh, thank God.  Kurt Love is somewhere deep tongue-kissing Bobo right now since they're dating again.  Yeah, let's not think about that.  Yeah, let's not do that.  Are they back together?  They are.  They just started dating recently.  Good.  Yes.  They started anal, I heard. 
[00:25:30]  They do anal sex is what you're saying, Roland?  That's what's on the interwebs.  Oh, okay.  That's disturbing.  It is.  It's very strange.  But Roland is good for some information.  Um, well, how would you like a copy of I've Never Met an Idiot on the River Reflections  on Family Photography and Fly Fishing by the Fonz himself, Henry Winkler?  I would absolutely love that.  He signed it for you.  You know, that's just, yeah, that makes my day.  All right.  Well, congratulations.  You won.  Thank you.  So I'm going to put you on hold, okay? 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  It's amazing.  This is the secret.  Like, at SiriusXM, I've been told by, like, many, many, many sources that we don't really  have a rating system.  So what they do from time to time is they monitor call volume on shows.  That's true, right, Mars?  That's true.  Yeah.  That's true.  Now, is it randomly or you don't know?  No, they determine the top shows by the number of calls that you get in.  But, like, I specifically don't think...  You just said what you just said.  And that's why I tell you to just allow people to call. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, take calls.  They see it.  But I feel like I care...  They don't care about what's on the air.  They don't give a shit.  They just see those numbers coming in.  Like, oh, man, Sam's getting a lot of callers.  One...  I got to do that for a whole week, one week.  Yeah.  And just be like, we're taking calls because it's like...  I blew every week.  Whatever you give away is you just say, I have something for free for you.  And all the lines light up.  Look at the lines right now.  I already gave them away.  Watch it.  Watch it.  It's time.  What about a non-autograph copy?  Should we keep taking it?  Yeah, take it.  That's like everything. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Non-autograph.  Okay.  Can the interns handle sending...  How many copies do we have?  Where's the other two?  We have two more.  Do we have two more of each or just one more of each?  Let's see.  Because I'm going to keep giving shit away.  Oh, wait.  We have a...  Do we give...  Do we take the addresses from the people I put on hold?  We have...  Kurt's still on the line.  I think we have three of this and two of the other ones.  Do we have three copies of that?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And then two.  I'm going to impress some management today, Mars. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, three and two of those by these.  But they're not autographed.  But they're books.  Hey, Jason.  What's up, Sam?  I got...  Oh, that's another copy of the book?  Wow.  I got more books.  But they're not signed.  Do you still want them?  Sure, I want them.  Okay.  Which one do you want?  The ghost book or the fish book?  I will take the fish book.  And was that from Happy Days to Long Loss Brother?  Oh, shit.  Of course it was. 
[00:28:00]  I can't believe we didn't keep him on the line.  He just wanted the ghost book.  Yeah.  Oh, you're right.  Well, thank you, Jason.  I'm going to put you on hold.  Okay.  Is this impressing some people?  Yes, yes.  Is this what I need to do, Mars?  Absolutely.  Now, what's the best strategy here?  Should I hang up on people so more people call in?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm going to hang up.  Andy, you're not a winner.  Andrew, you're not a winner.  Ronnie, you're not a winner.  I'm going to impress some people. 
[00:28:30]  They keep on calling back.  Joe, you're not a winner.  Hello.  Greg, you're not a winner.  Don, not a winner.  Look at his phone.  This is what matters.  This is what matters.  That's amazing.  Al, not a winner.  Them phones are lit up again.  They're going to be like, oh, my God, who is this superstar?  Line five, you're on after Open Anthony Live.  Hello.  Hello, Brad Gilbert.  Yeah, no, no, no.  You're too slow.  I'm going to have to free up the line. 
[00:29:00]  Line six, you're on after Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  You are almost too slow.  How's it going?  What's your name?  Hello, Jason.  Jason, do you want a book that's not signed?  Yes, sir.  Well, you just want a copy of Ghost Buddy by Henry Winkler.  Thank you.  I have a seven-year-old who will like reading that.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold.  Thank you.  Somebody, there's three of you interns back there.  You better be keeping track.  That was line six.  I don't want to hear about any of these people because the callers are what's going to make 
[00:29:30]  me famous.  That's right.  Line four, too slow.  Line five, you're on the air.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  What's your name?  Hey, this is Al.  You hung up on me a second ago.  Yeah, I like the perseverance, Al.  Yes, sir.  But wait a minute.  Mars, are they going to be unimpressed that somebody could get through twice?  They don't know that.  No, I fish.  Come on.  They're good with it.  Okay, you fish?  Yes, I do.  You want the Henry Winkler fishing book?  Yes, sir.  You got it.  Line five gets a Henry Winkler fishing book. 
[00:30:00]  Congratulations, Al.  All right, I'm going to put him on hold.  Oh, man, Mars.  Yep.  Is this my big break?  Yes, it is.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Line one, you're going to make me number one.  What's your name?  Josh.  Josh, where are you from?  Pennsylvania.  Well, you are in a spooky point of view because you just won Ghost Buddy.  Wait.  Yeah, I thought you'd be excited.  Hold on the line.  Line one, just won a copy of Ghost Buddy. 
[00:30:30]  Let's see.  Line eight, I'm going to hang up on you because I want some more calls coming through.  Line four, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, this is Paul.  What's up, Paul?  Which one do you like?  Ghosts or fishes?  I don't know, man.  I got three kids.  Should I go for fishing for a ghost book or what?  I say think about your kids first.  That's what Henry Winkler would want you to do.  He's such a nice man.  And go for the ghost book.  All right.  Could I get you to sign it there, Sammy Boyd? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, I'm going to sign it right now.  This is very exciting.  You got a Sharpie over there rolling.  Whoa.  Almost hit me, but I caught it still.  I'm going to sign it.  What's your name?  Paul.  To Paul.  You are cute.  Why don't you give him both books, Sam?  Oh, that would be fantastic.  Let's give him both books.  No.  You know what, Paul?  I would give you both books, but I need to take more calls.  I got to be on some next level shit.  Sam, I'll be like the biggest fan of all time, buddy. 
[00:31:30]  I'll be putting up the bill of books.  Paul, I already signed a book for you.  I got to give it to somebody else so I can take another call.  Or Sam, how about this?  All right.  I'm going to put you on hold, okay?  Sam.  It's all right, man.  Hold on my side.  I'm going to put you on hold.  Sam, I'm going to give him both books, and I'll do this for you.  So, in February, we'll give away a major A-list rod giraffe.  In February?  Next week.  Can I just give this to somebody else and still do that?  You can do whatever you want.  Okay, thank you very much.  Line six, this is the last book. 
[00:32:00]  Hi, Sam.  It's Craig from Tulsa.  Craig, I think you're going to make me a star here.  You are a star, Sam.  Thank you very much.  You just won a fishing book.  Oh, thank you so much.  Will you sign mine, too?  Of course I will.  Thanks, Sam.  What did you say your name was?  Craig?  Yes, sir.  Say that again?  Craig, yeah.  Craig, okay.  Two.  Craig.  Catch.  One.  For.  Me.  Exclamation. 
[00:32:30]  I will never leave my bookshelf, Sam.  Thank you so much.  All right, buddy.  That's time for Craig.  That's the last book.  I'm going to put you on.  He hung up.  No, he didn't.  He did?  Oh, you're still there, right?  Oh, this is Jeff.  How you doing?  Oh, yeah.  Craig hung up.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Craig, call back.  Just find someone else named Craig.  I'm not going to find anyone else named Craig.  Oh, I know who you give it to.  Who?  Oh, Craigie Brow, our old intern.  Intern, everybody has to hang up.  Interns hang up on everybody so Craig can call back and get his book. 
[00:33:00]  And don't, I mean, if you want Craig's signed book, just call up and say your name's Craig.  What can I do?  Craig hung up.  I don't know why he would do that.  But there's a book signed for Craig that he's going to get.  Listen, I've got to talk to you about this because, serious, I mean, they also, like, when you talk about, you know, people who you like, people who you'd recommend.  I don't know where the copy is.  You've got to find the copy first.  Look.  Hi, Monica.  She's waving.  She's headed over to Troy's booth.  I wonder what's going on over there. 
[00:33:30]  Listen, Mars, don't even worry about it.  I'm going copy free on this one.  Troy, is this going to be turning it up?  You may have to buy her something.  Steven Singer jewelers, Troy.

IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM  Or on the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Steven Singer Jewelers.  Yes!  The great Ron Bennington is here.  I'm glad people are finally getting around to hate Steven Singer, too.  I don't know if you noticed what I was just doing.  No. 
[00:35:00]  I just did the read, copy, free.  Good.  That's an impressive feat.  And Mars was telling me before you got here...  Yeah.  ...that the trick to management thinking that you're a very powerful show...  Right.  ...is the phones.  So I gave away, like, eight Henry Winkler books.  Why weren't you selling them?  I mean, you got all these great books.  Well, I mean, we had...  I thought I'd just get more calls.  But for as free as they are, you can let them go for, like, let's say, three bucks a piece.  Yeah, he's right. 
[00:35:30]  You can make $24.  You do that every day, suddenly we're having a nice fucking party.  I guess I'm just...  You're right.  I'm not as business-minded as you are sometimes.  You know what?  You gotta make the money where you can in this business.  You're right.  Where's the rock today?  The sex man is moving into his big mansion.  Moving?  Yeah, he takes a whole day to do a walkthrough.  Is that right?  He's moving to his big mansion, and he said he may not be in tomorrow either.  So, I mean, he's got...  He's got a great job.  He's got a lot of rooms to fill. 
[00:36:00]  Would you be okay if your staff was like, hey, I gotta move into my mansion.  I'm not gonna be there, Roddy B.  Yeah, well, the difference is none of my staff ever saw me kill anyone.  So, something, Iraq saw.  Yeah.  I don't know whether it was with Oprah or Jimmy.  I don't know.  But he saw something, and so far he's been doing the right thing, so he's getting his back scratched.  Whatever you want.  Whatever you want, Iraq.  This guy, Craig, he won a book, and he had me sign it for him, and I made it out to Craig, and then he hung up the phone. 
[00:36:30]  I go to his list.  He's fucking great.  Is that the same guy?  Yeah.  Hey, Line 4, you're on the show.  Hello?  Hey, do you want Craig's book?  I'll take any book I can get.  All right.  What's your name?  My name is Keith.  All right, Keith, I'm gonna cross out Craig's name.  Because I want to.  Oh.  You hung up?  Oh, what happened?  Hello? 
[00:37:00]  Hello?  Phil from Jersey City.  All right.  This happens to be a rating shill for Sam.  And Phil, you want this book?  No, I just want a shill for Sam.  Oh, I already crossed out Craig's name and wrote Phil.  All right.  Well, I appreciate the call, then.  That's when the next one gets Sam.  Yeah, next one.  I'll cross Phil out.  Sal says Craig called back, and they got his information.  Oh, they did?  All right.  Phil, I appreciate the call.  And what I'll do, then, is I'll cross out Phil, and I'll write Craig again.  There you go.  Okay, that's still a good autograph.  That's a nice signed copy for Craig. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, I don't know.  What do you mean?  I mean.  There's a lot of cross out stuff.  But it's like a human thing.  It's like, yeah.  I got a book for Zito.  What's that?  I got a book called The Bible, and I want him to read it cover to cover.  It's about Jesus.  Is that how it's about?  It is about Jesus.  I haven't read it.  Yeah.  He needs some guidance.  He was a really smart little baby, and I didn't hear much about him, and then they killed him.  That was it.  It touches me.  And he spit at him, too.  But don't you think there's, like, missing stuff in the Bible? 
[00:38:00]  Like, you never hear of, like, 14-year-old Jesus.  Like puberty.  Yeah, like Jesus needed braces.  Yeah.  Or, like, meeting chicks for the first time, or how he was with that.  Apparently he wasn't that interested.  He went from baby to carpenter.  And it's like, well, where do you pick up all these skills?  You're right.  Why do you think Zito needs the Bible?  Do you never notice, too, of all the pictures—well, they're not pictures.  I guess they're illustrations—that you see of Jesus.  There's never him just sullying or—you know what I mean?  No. 
[00:38:30]  It's just—he wasn't—  Those are for the Mexicans.  They—the Mexicans.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  It's racial.  But why do you say that Zito needs to read the Bible?  Just—  It's just—he's been running around with the wrong crowd.  There's been, you know, kind of a West Memphis 3 thing about him lately.  Killing babies.  A lot of Metallica.  Yeah.  Well, not babies, but small kids.  Yeah, like—  That's awful.  I just like to see Jesus with a level gun.  I don't even understand why this is off.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  I did the measurements. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, it all added up.  You know you have those days where no matter what you do, you can't pull it off.  Yeah.  All he's trying to do is build that stool.  Oh.  Not like—  No, I didn't know.  No, it's just like a stool you sit on.  Because I know you're shock jocking.  Now, this is weird because when I was in with you guys last week—  Mm-hmm.  And by the way, thank you, everybody, for that.  You treated me like I was part of it.  And Kenny kept asking me if I wanted anything to eat or drink.  By the way, everybody, when you were in last week, stepped up their game like the king 
[00:39:30]  had arrived.  Oh, that's really nice to hear.  That's really nice to hear.  Like, you can even tell—like, the listeners were picking up on it.  That first hour, Opie and Anthony were just like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  They're never there that first hour.  They're always just like—  It is really early.  Yeah.  I mean, it's too early to do radio.  But you brought it out in them.  And then—I don't know if you realize this or not.  Because it's too early to even listen.  You probably—E-Rock has never been so quick with music cues as when you were in. 
[00:40:00]  I mean, he does not play a bed for anything.  And he was just firing them off while you were in studio.  And I remember thinking to myself, oh, he's good.  That is—he's good.  Right on those music cues.  He's really good with the music cues.  No, but there were—I mean, he was like, listen, I don't know if it was a subconscious  thing or if he was sitting there going, Ron Bennington's in here.  I've got to be on my A game.  You guys miss, like, when O&A used to do the afternoon show and then we would do nights  at NEW, they would just come in drinking all the time. 
[00:40:30]  So it was a totally different thing.  Yeah.  No, now—yeah, that's—the morning thing is you can't do that.  And then by 3 o'clock, the channel's done.  You know, and the—yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's really.  It's strange.  It's really strange here.  But—  Well, and I don't want to say who, but some of the people here like to squeeze the fun  out of it.  Just squeeze every drop of fun out of radio.  Let's see. 
[00:41:00]  If we move O&A to the mornings and then separate them from Ron and Fez by an hour, then we might  not have quite as much fun.  And also make it less wanting people to hang around.  Yeah.  I mean, like, yeah, you can hang around, but you're not going to have any fun.  Yeah, exactly.  If you're going to be here, we'll schedule some meetings.  If not, you can go home.  Right.  But if you're just hanging around, we'll schedule a few things for you.  If O&A stay any later than 10, these guys make them try on uncomfortable pants.  That's their eyes like, hey, let's get your itchy suits. 
[00:41:30]  Let's put you in itchy suits.  I know you wanted the picture in the lobby.  We really think some wardrobe and they come out with the, you know, tweed blazers and stuff.  Now, the other thing is, and I wish you guys would bring it up to him, that Rob Cross has  to realize he's so much luckier than Gary is because Rob's life runs really nice.  Yeah.  Because it's just because of the, he's not, he's not, there's no demands on him.  He's just like, okay, I'm just here to be the guy.  Like, whatever you need, I'll do, but I'm not in charge. 
[00:42:00]  But I'm also the same way with him.  I'm like, hey, buddy, everything's great.  Yeah.  Where O&A and Gary have this relationship.  Not good.  No.  Not good.  I mean, it's the type of thing where it's like, holy shit, they just said that about  a real person.  To me, it always looks like a World War II dogfight.  Where it's spinning planes, shooting, which way's up, which way's down.  I always think it's like, this is an adult with like a wife and a family and everything.  And they're just disrespectful at this point.  Well, they have every right to. 
[00:42:30]  But you know what?  It's all for the sake of entertainment.  And it's all for because we all care so much about the product.  That's all it is in the end.  In the end, we're all working for the same goal.  Did you get these books because Mick Foley came in reading one on his own?  No.  Henry Winkler was in tonight.  Yeah.  And so they sent all the books out to O&A.  Uh-huh.  And O&A don't like to read.  Right.  You know what I mean?  They don't like that stuff.  They like visual things. 
[00:43:00]  They like a video.  What time did Henry Winkler come in?  He was on from 8 to 8.30 or so.  Who's that?  That's Monica.  That's Troy's little piece that he has voicing all the production for some reason.  Yeah.  Tomorrow's Adam Ferrara's coming in, too.  Adam Ferrara.  And you know who's filling in the Jimmy chair tomorrow?  We said last week it was Ron Bennington.  Yeah.  We don't know where to go from there.  So we got a celebrity.  Trump Jr. is coming in to fill the Jimmy chair.  The odd thing is we both have the same dad.  You do?  That's incredible. 
[00:43:30]  Now, when Henry Winkler came in, did he call them O&A, which would have been the best  bit ever?  He didn't use that one.  Henry Winkler.  O&A.  Have you met him?  No.  I don't believe I have.  He's very soft-spoken and very nice.  Like one of the books that he signed just for a listener just says, you're powerful, Henry  Winkler.  That's nice.  It's great.  You are smart.  You are invincible. 
[00:44:00]  Now, he didn't say that.  He did.  He did.  I'm trying to think of the help.  He did a little of the Fonzie voice, though, when he was in here.  And that was exciting.  To see it.  Like, you know.  Did he bring Leather Tuscadero in?  No.  No guess with him.  Did you guys try to put him in a Malachi Crunch?  No.  All these things.  These are like missed opportunities, I feel.  Why didn't you have Mick Foley in at the same time?  Because he loves the Fonz.  Because we couldn't have that amount of niceness in one room at one time. 
[00:44:30]  It's just like, just joy and goodness and charity and it doesn't work for this show.  I love the fact that ONA will have all their guests in together and then a couple of times  Mick Foley said things to the other guests.  I'm like, I don't know how this person is going to respond to this.  Yeah.  Well, that's what ONA like to do.  Like, they'll interview somebody.  And then the next guy's coming in and they go, so are you sticking around?  Or half the time the guest goes, yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess. 
[00:45:00]  It would be impolite to leave.  Right.  So they stick around.  So let's bring in the stripper.  Well, listen.  You should stick around for Roderick Fez because that's what's coming up next.  That's what's going on.  Segway.  We'll be back.  Giving away Bibles.  You have Bibles.  You're trying to steal my phone heat, aren't you?  I am.  You're trying to prove to the bosses that you've got listeners too.  Why do the phones matter to them?  Mars was just telling me.  That's how they tally the numbers, you know, that they think those are the subscribers that  are listening to your show.  Right.  And this scared me because usually I don't take any calls whatsoever. 
[00:45:30]  I don't even ask people to call in.  Well, ONA also don't take any calls.  No.  They're like, don't call here.  We have at least nine, though.  As Zito just pointed out, we have at least nine.  It filled up all nine.  Hey, I don't know who this kid is, but his phones are popping today.  There was literally 30 phone calls.  It's just like at 17, this goes off.  Money and accounting guys are looking shit over.  Yeah, listen.  I have a feeling there's going to be a lot more than just Steven Singer live reads coming 
[00:46:00]  from this show.  Oh, sure.  Especially after those calls.  Anything big planned for Rana Fez?  Emmy Rossum?  Emmy Rossum.  That's very exciting.  The show Shameless is coming in.  Beautiful girl.  And we thought it would be fun to find out what she can bench.  Oh, I love stunts.  Yeah.  I love celebrity stunts.  Now, this could go, and then the listeners will win stuff.  So if she can bench press 440 pounds, every listener will get a new car. 
[00:46:30]  Make sure you're calling up.  If she does it during the show today.  Make sure you call up for that.  And stay tuned.  It's coming up next.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  And catch O.P. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next. </pre>
