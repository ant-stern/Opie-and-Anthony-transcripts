<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious rebuttal of a Page Six article falsely claiming Opie's fiancée had made a sex tape with Bam Margera.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton were in studio, expressing extreme frustration, blaming the false story on disgruntled ex-employees. Opie specifically called out one ex-employee for harassing other radio shows, predicting this would backfire.  To counter the Page Six story, Opie offered a $100,000 reward for the nonexistent tape, highlighting the lack of journalistic integrity in Page Six and the New York Post for not contacting them or Bam Margera before publication.  They played a recording of an interview where the Page Six writer, Chauncey Hayden, admitted to never seeing the tape.  Bam Margera then joined the show via phone, vehemently denying the story and matching Opie's $100,000 reward.  Other early show segments included Jimmy Norton's PlayStation 3 troubles, a discussion about animals winning fights (including a grizzly bear killing its trainer from "Semi-Pro"), and a report on Indonesian massage parlors using padlocks to deter prostitution.  The hosts teased future segments exposing their ex-employees and Page Six.

Bam Margera remained a prominent guest, continuing to address the sex tape hoax and his frustration with the media. He mentioned upcoming projects, including a movie with James Cox (who was present in studio).  The hosts praised superfans Matt and Joe for their help in debunking the story.  The conversation then shifted to Steve-O, his struggles, and near-death experiences, with Bam sharing anecdotes from the Jackass crew's history, including Ryan Dunn's infamous rodeo incident.  The show also covered sports, including the Red Sox jersey buried at Yankee Stadium, the Dallas Cowboys, the Flyers vs. Canadiens playoff series, and the banning of Sean Avery shirts.  Travis's wife, a Canadiens fan, called in, leading to humorous exchanges about their relationship and their dog, Dexter, whose YouTube videos were mentioned. A recurring bit about a fictional Congolese sorcerer who shrinks penises was also introduced. The segment concluded with more discussion of the sex tape hoax and praise for those who helped resolve it, and a brief mention of a near-accident involving a friend nicknamed "Batman" and his wife, and another friend nicknamed "Joker."

The show continued with more bizarre humor, starting with expanded details about the Congolese "penis snatcher." The conversation transitioned to Atlantic City's ineffective smoking ban, smoking in comedy clubs, and government regulation of smoking. This was followed by a discussion of Peter Falk's apparent public meltdown, referencing audio of the incident.  Darkly comedic jokes about a new amusement park in Baghdad followed,  leading to a “Fun-o-meter” segment rating various topics and guests (including a running gag about a stereotypical Asian man in a Six Flags commercial), featuring mentions of Pat Duffy and E-Rock.  A lengthy interview with mixed martial arts fighter Randy Couture and comedian Pat Cooper then commenced.  The conversation covered Couture's career, his resignation from the UFC, potential fights (including a potential match against Fedor Emelianenko), the differences between MMA and boxing, injuries, the business side of MMA, and various fighters and rivalries.  They also promoted Couture's movie, "Red Belt."

Pat Cooper's interview continued as a major segment.  He shared numerous rambling and often vulgar stories about his life and career, including interactions with Joe DiMaggio and Frank Sinatra, his views on aging and death, graphic accounts of doctor visits, and opinions on family and legacy. He compared Vegas and New York's gambling cultures. The hosts discussed the differences between Cooper's and newer comedians' styles, specifically mentioning Jimmy Schubert.  Humor was derived from Cooper's stories, his age, and the hosts' bathroom banter about Anthony's perceived penis size. The hosts promoted Cooper's upcoming shows.

The show concluded with a segment dominated by crude humor and sexual innuendo focused on Anthony's perceived penis size, featuring graphic comparisons to animals and weapons.  A retrospective on their ten-year anniversary in New York radio followed, including anecdotes about their firing from a Boston station, demanding workloads, creative production solutions, awards, and a humorous story about a specific radio commercial.  Jimmy Norton heavily participated in the sexually charged banter, and a listener letter with explicit sexual content was read.

[00:04:00]  and once again  I'm not naming any names  I mean we've had a lot of people  work for us over the years  yeah  I remember a certain employee  instead of like  working for the show  he would just spend like  an incredible  I don't even want to put a  time limit on it  like just  an incredible amount of time  on computers  and on different phones  just harassing the hell  out of other radio shows  yeah  and I thought it was hilarious  but I remember  even back then  you know  this can't be good 
[00:04:30]  in the end  somehow this is gonna hurt us  yeah  we were going down memory lane  yesterday  weren't we  oh certainly were  so yesterday  was a perfect firestorm  of  you know  just finally fed up  with ex-employees  running to the media  to try to trash us  and take us down  and the stupid media  just buying anything  they hear  because it makes  for a good story  oh absolutely  and that's the other part  of this  so they print  out and out lies 
[00:05:00]  well they've been  printing out and out lies  about all of us  on this radio show  they never get their facts  right  that's one reason  I know  Jimmy Norton  heterosexual  you know  why  well hold on  what  that was a low blow  it certainly was  now eat your banana sexy like  I don't want to eat  I just want to play with this  push the back of your head on  I love when you do that  come on  we need something  give us the  give us the  yeah  he pushes the back of his head 
[00:05:30]  onto his banana  as he eats it  we definitely need some  that's so god damn funny  we need a lot more humor today  because yesterday was very  very serious  but  for years  the media gets it wrong  about us  gets it wrong about our show  gets it wrong about some of the  crazy  outrageous things we've done  with our radio show  and once again  not saying this for  boo hoo  you know  we know  we know what we got ourselves into 
[00:06:00]  but yesterday  it finally came to a point like  had it  done  now we're gonna have some fun  and boy was I on the phone  pretty much  what time did we leave yesterday  nine in the morning  from nine in the morning  until ten o'clock at night  and boy did we  as a radio show  get a lot of things  accomplished yesterday  a lot of things came together  a lot of people came to the table  absolutely  any more cliches  I could throw in there  no  no no  and of course  the newspapers today  all running  running scared 
[00:06:30]  and hiding  and not printing  a follow up  to yesterday's  rant  no why would they  on this show  why would they  this all started  with page six  from the post  claiming that  that my lovely fiancee  who doesn't want to be part  of any of this crap  who is an extremely bright girl  she's  she's a shy girl  has no desire  to be famous  no desire  to be in the media spotlight  no desire to quote 
[00:07:00]  get a little exposure  page six  and this Chauncey Hayden  went after  after my girl  yesterday  and claimed that  you know  before she met me  she did a sex tape  with Bam Margera  right  which is just  an all out lie  and I think  a lot of people  are starting to realize  that today  but unfortunately  the damage  has been done  and now  it's going to get  really  really  ugly  some of the things  I found out yesterday  page six  says they try to  contact you and I 
[00:07:30]  and our agent  for the last three weeks  oh really  yeah  well  we're easily accessible  I will be signing  an affidavit  on that point alone  no one tried  to contact me  no one tried  to contact  Bam Margera  by the way  wait till we get  into that part  of the story  a little later  this morning  gee I wonder  how you know that  wait till you  wait till we get  into that part  a little later  this morning  wait till the  Bombay doors  open up  and we drop a few  right 
[00:08:00]  today  the fact is  we got disgruntled  employees that are  damaged people  bad people  not human  women that  couldn't take it  when their time  with the Opie and  Anthony show  was up  and now they  feel like they  have to get  you know  they have to  get us back  that's fine  actually  that's human  nature  I kind of  get that  in a way  but not  when it comes  to just  telling flat  out lies  which a couple  people in  recent weeks  have been doing  okay  yeah  and then you  got Chauncey  Hayden  who has  hated us 
[00:08:30]  for a very  very long  time  because we  don't give  him the  respect  that he's  just desperately  freaking  hoping for  you know  he's a  he's a  Howard guy  and then  when  when Howard  Stern  you know  doesn't like  the guy  or you know  he's on the  outs with  Howard  then he tries  to come into  our camp  and get on  our good  side  and trash  Howard  blah blah  blah  and we just  kind of go  oh that's  real interesting  Chauncey  great  blah blah  blah  and we don't  want anything  to do  with the  guy  so he's  had it  out for  us for  a long  time 
[00:09:00]  so he  decides  somehow  he was  able to  get page  six  to print  this  incredible  lie  yesterday  about my  girl  and the  sex  tape  yeah  I have  I'll give  you this  much  already  I have  proof  someone  talked to  Chauncey  yesterday  on record  okay  Chauncey  admitted  on record  in this  interview  that he  never saw  a tape  now  the newspaper  article  said  there's  a tape  where they're  doing the 
[00:09:30]  nasty  and  he says  oh  and it's  nasty  he is  quoted  in page  six  saying  you know  about this  sex tape  starring  my  fiance  that  all the  action  is nasty  or something  like that  oh it is  nasty  nasty  and I mean  nasty  and I mean  what's the  exact quote  because I'm  not  you know  I'm a  douche  well  me  yeah  well  yeah  where is  it there  Iraq  no  Chauncey  we don't  have it  in front 
[00:10:00]  of me  right now  we'll get  in a  second  and it  comes out  here  here's  the exact  quote  because  my  buddy  from  FMQB  this guy  Mike  interviewed  Chauncey  yesterday  oh here  it is  they're  doing  this is  what  Chauncey  Hayden  said  in the  article  on  page  six  yesterday  about  this  sex  tape  Chauncey  Hayden  they're  doing  the  nasty  and I  mean  nasty  Hayden  says  Hughes  is  taking  legal  action  to  prevent  its  distribution  no I'm  not  never did  because the  tape doesn't  exist  wrong  and I 
[00:10:30]  want to  thank the  media for  just  blowing off  the fact  that I  offered  $100,000  yesterday  for not  even the  original  quote  sex  tape  I said  I said  I would  offer  $100,000  for a  copy  of the  tape  just to  prove it  exists  because I  know damn  well  it doesn't  exist  and that's  why I  threw that  out there  the papers  completely  avoided that  completely  because they  don't want to  be involved  at this  point  because they  know this  is just  complete  BS  and stupid  David Hinckley 
[00:11:00]  this was the  biggest radio  story in  New York  yesterday  his headline  in his radio  column says  Zippier  morning news  show is  going public  wow really  that's what he  wrote about  in today's  paper  and we had  the biggest  radio story  in New York  yesterday  Hinckley's  column  one flag  we'll get  into that  a little  later  Zippier  morning news  show is  going public  way to go  David  way to have  your pulse  on what's  happening  in New York  radio  yeah 
[00:11:30]  so  Chauncey's  quoted  saying that  in this  page 6  article  yesterday  about the  sex tape  so my  buddy  Mike  from  FMQB  calls  Chauncey  and this  douche  who was  so desperate  for attention  and desperate  for acceptance  and desperate  for fame  actually called  Mike back  what a dummy  why would you  do that  and if you go  to FMQB.com  you can see  this for yourself  but basically  this is what 
[00:12:00]  is printed  contacted by  FMQB  Hayden  admitted  he hasn't  actually seen  the tape  but was made  aware of  its alleged  existence  by a couple  a couple  ex-employees  of the  Opie and  Anthony show  saying they  described the  tape in such  great detail  that he  believed they  were telling  the truth  now when I  read that  to Anthony  yesterday  we probably  laughed  we couldn't  even talk  anymore  we probably  laughed for  two straight  minutes  because I 
[00:12:30]  go hey  Anthony  I got a  sex tape  you know  of you  I'm going  to describe  it now  yeah  describe it  to prove  that it  exists  alright  it was  you  you have  like a  mustache  looks like  you got  a goatee  kind of  thing  yeah  is that  enough  detail  yeah  this  Chauncey  Hayden  has been  a scum  for many  many years  and you  know what  he finally  got caught  and it's  going to  get  Chauncey  I know  you're  listening  it's  going to  get so  ugly  for you  and I  don't even  feel sorry  for you  you're a  dope 
[00:13:00]  me either  you're a  dope  you've been  gunning for  us for a  long time  and guess  what  you are so  done now  you are so  so  done  he craves  attention  well  you're going  to get  a lot  of attention  I guess  the guy's  an attention  whore  well you're  going to get  some great  attention  now  everyone's  going to  realize  what kind  of a  hack  you really  are  phony  it's been  out there  a few  other  celebrities  have  complained  about  some  of the  interviews  that  they  have  done  with  Chauncey 
[00:13:30]  and now  we got  a doozy  brewing  right now  a doozy  when he  said  you called  him up  after an  interview  yeah  and no one  believed me  that was another  lie  I didn't say  that  we did an  interview  back with  Chauncey  this was early  on in our  New York  career  when we  didn't really  know his  character  and we  told you  he came  in and he  was trashing  Howard like  crazy  because he  was on  the  out  with  Howard 
[00:14:00]  and we're  like  well that's  wonderful  but you know  if you're here  to interview us  why don't we  do the  interview  and it  turned out  to be  in  penthouse  magazine  which should  have been  a nice  thing for  us  but there  were so  many  lies  in the  interview  he started  talking about  other radio  shows that  weren't even  on in New  York yet  when we  did the  interview  there were  so many  things in  this thing  that were  wrong  and then he  claims I  called up  and I  wanted more  attention  than Anthony  more credit  for wow 
[00:14:30]  that's what it  was  and other  things  how would  that help  me in the  end  and then he's  gone on Howard  like a million  times to say  that exact  story  and I have  to just sit  here and bite  my lip  like this  guy is full  of s and  someday he'll  get his  well guess  what we  finally got  him really  really good  and we got  page six  and the post  really really  good  this just  shows them  for the  phony  lying sacks  right  you can't 
[00:15:00]  just  you can't  just print  you know  lies like  the post  did yesterday  without even  doing you  know minimal  minimal fact  checking  minimal  like no one  contacted me  to get my  opinion or my  thoughts on this  whole thing that  was going down  okay and more  importantly no  one contacted  Bam Margera  nope  guess what it  took maybe  ten minutes to  get him on the  phone yesterday  after the show  maybe ten  minutes  yep  and boy do

[00:24:30]  you recently  Jimmy  your stuff  is amazing  your animal  stuff is  great  can't fool  us  very timely  with this  bear attack  it'll be  amazing  you should  work the  bear story  into your  stand up  this weekend  in Chicago  well  there's a  grizzly bear  that killed  its trainer  these stories  come up  every once  in a while  right  of course  when the  animals win  they win  one  you know  the tiger  emerged victorious  on the 
[00:25:00]  Siegfried and  Roy show  years back  never so often  my favorite  of course  is unfortunately  the muzzled  bear  I would have  liked to see  him unmuzzled  just beating  the crap  out of that  woman sitting  next to him  they always  do that  on when  animals attack  oh on the  TV show  yeah  and the  bear is  sitting in  a chair  which bears  probably love  to do  just sit in  chairs like  an office  chair  and there's  a woman  sitting next  to the  bear  and she  is  like 
[00:25:30]  if you  had a  bear  scope  you know  how you  let  infrared  and  ultraviolet  and heat  sensitive  scopes  that you  can see  and people  glow  if you  had a  bear  sight  that what  bears see  when fear  comes off  of people  she would  have been  glowing  because she  was scared  crapless  sitting next  to this  bear  and you  could see  it  her eyes  were darting  over at the  bear  and the  bear  must  just  smell  that  crap  and  just  smacked 
[00:26:00]  her in  the head  knocks  her on  the floor  bear  had it  just starts  pouncing  on her  and would  have ripped  her head  off  if he  wasn't  muzzled  but  I love  when the  animals win  I think  the bears  don't like  wearing that  snout  no that  muzzle  is horrible  for a bear  absolutely  and my  favorite  animal  winning  story  of all  time  birthday  cake  chimp  birthday  cake  chimp  where  the  couple  had a 
[00:26:30]  chimpanzee  brought it  to a  wildlife  refuge  because  it had  gotten  too big  and a  little  too  wily  for their  house  but they  would visit  the little  chimp  and one  day  they brought  the chimp  a birthday  cake  and another  chimp  at the  refuge  did not  like  the fact  that this  other  chimp  was getting  cake  or something  who knows  what's  going on  in his  chimp head  two other  chimps  and decided  to attack  the gentleman  ripping off  his thumbs  eating his  face  his foot 
[00:27:00]  and of  course  his genitals  that were  removed  from these  primates  that were  angry  because they  didn't get  a piece  of cake  well after  a good  dinner  you need  a nice  dessert  of course  oh they  got their  cake  I bet  you know  what though  got a  delicious  treat  after  that meal  I'll say  this though  you can  say what  you like  but someone  learned a  lesson  and would  not be  stingy with  the cake  ever again  I'll bet  no  cake for 
[00:27:30]  all the  chimps  when a  chimp  wants cake  hands it  over  yes  I'll try to  tell a  wild chimp  no cake  for you  he'll go  home  thumbless  not having  sex  limping  with no  face  noseless  and his  wife had  no thumb  I guess  his wife  tried to  Fonzie  the things  off  and they  ripped her  thumb off  I think  bears have  had it  too  because I  hear they  nail their  feet to  the little  pedals on  bicycles and  stuff  so they  nail them  I hear they  pretty much  nail them  down  yeah  or at least 
[00:28:00]  tie them down  pretty good  9-1-1 call  from the bear  attack  oh really  well here's  the latest bear  attack  it's a little  different than  past grizzly bear  attacks  and in  California  the bear  who attacked  and killed  its trainer  recently appeared  in the film  semi-pro  with comedian  Will Ferrell  officials say  the 700 pound  grizzly bear  bit  Stephen Miller  on the neck  during the  taping of a  promotional video  the attack  happened at 
[00:28:30]  a training  center for  animals used  in movies  and television  shows  oh wow  they got  freaking  video  where's the  video  put it up  so it's the  grizzly bear  from semi-pro  that Will Ferrell's  character was  wrestling with  yep  the bear  probably killed  the trainer  for getting  him in that  dumb movie  the crappy movie  you think it was  the bear's pissed  right  he was a creative  decision  right  I can't believe  you put me in  this piece of  crap movie  you'll pay 
[00:29:00]  someone thought  they heard the  bear say  you've mismanaged  my career  and just  tore his throat  out  nope  you're just  nothing but a  dumb bear  smack neck  and of course  here's the scene  from semi-pro  needs a little  setup  this is the  bear that  killed its  trainer  come on dude  you're just  nothing but a  dumb bear  smack neck  yeah  crazy fist  I'm coming  with crazy fist  this is fine  he's not doing 
[00:29:30]  anything  flit  can you dig  it  jackie  move  flit  wow  that must have  been exactly  what the attack  sounded like  without the  wacky music  unless that was  playing over the  PA  yeah  I forgot the 
[00:30:00]  scene from that  movie but yeah  he's basically  not basically  heard of yourself  taunting the  bear so  the bear's  finally had  finally had  it killed his  trainer  spit his throat  yeah yeah  it licked his  face first  did it really  yeah and then he  probably thought  you know  aww  aww  aww  it's giving me  kisses  lays those big  bear teeth into  your neck  you're dead  he licked his  face  yeah  the bear  licked his  face  I wanted to 
[00:30:30]  make sure the  food was going  to be good  yeah ooh  that tastes  good  you know we  maybe smell  it a little  bit I think  animals they  lick and then  they then they  eat  wow  yeah  uh let's say  hi to Wes  in Alabama  Wes what's up  hey guys what's  happening  good morning  um actually  this is Wes  in Alabama  uh  uh  yeah I mean  like it would  kind of suck  if I said  alakazum  uh  are you 
[00:31:00]  trying to  make a joke  because uh  the article  yesterday said  that we  banned the  word  we banned  the word  bam  from this  radio  oh so  he can't  say Alabama  I get it  all right Wes  thank you sir  turns out  bam uh  is a stand up  guy  turns out  he's a really  nice guy  yeah  uh  so  we'll have  a little  something  something  in the  seven o'clock  hour  sure  if you're  interested in  that whole  sex tape 
[00:31:30]  scandal that  started in  uh  the post  yesterday  scandalous  oh boy  people are  waking up  uh  not happy  today  not happy  today  I'm happy  today  other people  are not  gonna be  happy  today  especially  later on  today  phone number  877-212-0&A  if you got  anything for  the uh  the radio  show  what else  is going  on  I didn't  get to  watch the  news or  read uh  or read  any papers  or magazines  the last 24  hours  you're busy  I know uh  I don't know  anything actually 
[00:32:00]  I was even  gonna just pull  something out of  my you know  what but I  don't know  I know  nothing  did I mention  that I was  trying to get  my playstation  I'm not very  good at those  things  that's all you  can think  about now  right Jimmy  well your  grand theft  auto video  on youtube  is getting  quite a  amount of  views there  audio  it's hilarious  my face  I got no  play out  of it  yeah I  know  my pretty  face  didn't get  shot  but it's  youtube so  you gotta  call the  video so  basically what  you see is a  grand theft  auto 4  graphic and 
[00:32:30]  then you hear  jimmy uh  playing grand  theft auto and  uh man the  gaming community  just ate it  up ate it  up and now our  paper today in  new york here is  uh talking about  uh grand theft  auto and how  it's based on  new york city  and all  when does it  come out  tuesday  yeah 29th  right  right and  that's why you  got the  playstation 3  jimmy  no I  actually was  gonna get an  xbox 360 but  I got the  playstation  because I  want a  blu-ray  player I  saw clockwork  orange was  sold on  blu-ray  I'm like I  have to see  this I  want to try  this technology  anyway and 
[00:33:00]  my dvd player  was uh  broken so it  plays dvds  too right  yeah I  just got  separate  blu-ray  and uh  the only reason  I didn't do  that's a funny  story oh  funny the guy  told me that if  you get it  separate you  can't like use  it online to  upgrade this  one goes  online so I  can upgrade  and download  updates constantly  updates the  blu-ray  yeah for the  whole the  whole system  really for the  blu-ray there's  there's different  things that come  out that the  player wouldn't  have that I  bought well so  now we'll have  it problem with 
[00:33:30]  using playstation  3 I try to do a  playstation to use  it as a dvd player  you're like uh  rewind is that is  that x triangle  square that's my  shooting button  right or is it  just a square no  I bought a separate  remote for playstation  3 that you could use  as oh is that what  they did with  playstation 3 it's a  brand new remote  it's like a  regular nice I  was wondering if  they were gonna do  that because I  just got mine  hooked up and I  think play is  where how I  lob grenades  exactly uh  because the guy's  like you know  good news no I  don't know if I 
[00:34:00]  got a remote  because he he  set it up he  goes good news  you can you  know play uh  uh blu-ray  through this thing  and uh he goes  the bad news you  gotta still use the  uh the controller  yeah which was  always a pain in  the neck when  you were trying to  play dvds off  that system  uh let's say  hi to hi to  brooklyn ace  brooklyn ace  what's up  morning boys  ob since you  haven't been able  to pay attention  to the news  lately um  there was in  this article in  the post yesterday  about this guy 
[00:34:30]  greg hughes  something about  even if  fiancee  have a sex  date  well I don't  know  thank you sir  we're gonna be  dropping a bombshell  in the seven o'clock  hour as far as  that whole situation  goes uh  indonesia  massage parlors  uh doing something  very very interesting  jimmy  uh you like these  stories right  of course  indonesia's  massage parlors  frequently offer  massage  oh no  indonesia's  massage parlors  all for something 
[00:35:00]  different  they'll rub  wasabi on you  where the women  all smell like  sushi  oh no we got  another one of  those situations  where's that  original clip  sushi  indonesia  who says  massage  massage  massage  it's a massage  hold on a minute  all right 
[00:35:30]  this is  horseradish  you're most likely  to have come  across it  as the powerful  paste wasabi  that's eaten  with sushi  that's eaten  with sushi  sounds like  that guy  here's the story  about the  massage parlors  indonesia's  massage parlors  frequently offer  far more than  a relaxing  rub down  they're often  a front for  prostitution  something local  government in the  province of east  java is keen  to stamp out  so  dude I can't even  listen to this story  because I'm just  picturing you 
[00:36:00]  and how you  accent these  like his voice  goes up in the  weirdest place  yes their accents  just pops up  but massage parlors  are having  prostitution  boy they're really  right there  grabbing the news  as it happens  huh  who knew that  yeah  in indonesia  of all places  that's shocking  to everyone  what else are  they gonna do  as far as  massage parlors  go  mint in the  province of east  java is keen  to stamp out  so they've taken  a step back  in time  making masseuses 
[00:36:30]  wear a modern  day chastity belt  before disappearing  behind the curtain  with a customer  each worker  must have their  pants padlocked up  so if the pants  go  the owner will know  it's not disturbing  because they only  wear it when they  massage their customers  and after that  they can take it out  massage over  and clothing  still in place  the padlock  is returned  at face value  it's a simple  but effective  method of  preventing  prostitution  they padlock  the mouth  and the hand 
[00:37:00]  from going  into a circular  yeah  you can't quite  do the old  okay  with your fingers  so basically  you go in  for a relaxing  massage  and you have  to put this  huge  just padlock  apparatus  around your  groin  padlock  how could that  be good  so I'm trying  to get a release  from the ghost  of christmas past  yeah that doesn't  sound fun at all  no  even if you're  just going in  there for a massage  right 
[00:37:30]  not even for that  why would they  do this  so the place  doesn't get shut  down  cut down  on prostitution  really  how does it  cut down  on prostitution  because they  can't get  into the  naughty bits  it's all  padlocked up  the naughty bits  i'm very pleased  and enjoy  working here  wearing a padlock  makes us feel  secure  mainly muslim  indonesia  has seen a 
[00:38:00]  furious debate  over morale  who wears a padlock  the whores  or the  customers  oh the hooker  so her pants  can't come off  well that's  ridiculous  what  and then they  have to put  the mumps  wrap around  her head  so she can  only talk  to her jaw  like michael  corleone  the warrior  for teeth  shot  and then  put oven  mitts  on her  i thought  it was  the guys  no  they couldn't  get it  i so missed  that  that's still  easy then  i'm not  paying attention 
[00:38:30]  today  yeah that  like jimmy  well now  what jimmy  said makes  sense  there's other  options  a lot more  options  tf  do anything  indonesia  oh true  you could  tf  you could  pick teams  for baseball  you could  you know  you could  do something  with  ice pops  many many  options there  yeah there's  plenty  things  that was a 
[00:39:00]  waste of  time  now here's  where every  conversation  goes there  i would like  i'd like to  have sex  well we can't  because i have  yeah good for  you and your  padlock  jimmy you've  gone to a  bunch of  these places  in the past  i'm imagining  that uh  that's not  the release  they get  though they're  not getting  like an  all-out  session for  the most  part  don't they  because there's  they they call  it a uh  you have  here's the thing  you have  they call it  a certain  thing because  that's what  that's the 
[00:39:30]  that's what  they're able  to do  that's what  they do  you know  what i'm  trying to  say  we got  to keep  it clean  on this  side  you're not  having  all-out  sex but  the woman  is definitely  taking it  but for the  most part  she's massaging  with her  hands  right  yes  you know  so if she's  wearing a padlock  is that really  stopping  no just  you know  this type of  thing uh  happening in  the massage  parlors  just stops  the sex  it doesn't  stop what  they could  do with  their hands  or what  they could  do with  uh  other parts  of the body  simple as that  right  sushi 
[00:40:00]  right  i'm very  pleased  and enjoy  working here  wearing a padlock  makes us feel  secure  mainly muslim  indonesia has  seen a furious  debate over  morality in  recent years  lawmakers  passed a bill  last month  shielding young  people from  pornography on  the internet  but an early  draft has a  clause which  could see people  jailed for  kissing  authorities in  the tourist  areas of  batu and  malang also  want to make  the padlock  policy law  but local  women's  ministries say 
[00:40:30]  it isn't the  answer and  security cameras  would be a  much better way  to prevent  prostitution  yeah exactly  yeah that's  what you want  exactly  security cameras  in there  i thought this  story was great  when i first  uh looked at it  because i really  thought the guys  had to put on  some weird  team before  they uh  you know  before you walk  in there and lay  down  yeah before they  hit the table  get your rub  down  that'd suck  that sounds  filthy anyway  indonesia  well they're  very  they're they 
[00:41:00]  are i think  they're 90%  muslim i could  be wrong but  my manager of  course has been  there jonathan  goes there  he loves it  of course he's  an adventurer  the more the  more the more  the more likely  you are to have  your head removed  the faster jonathan  buys business  class tickets  jim i tell you  jakarta jim jim  he's a psychopath  we went uh  we went to dinner  after jim norton  did letterman  to this nice little  italian restaurant  and uh this guy  jonathan you know  him too man  he uh pulls out  pictures of his  latest trip  and i swear to god  i thought i was  looking at pictures  from the set of  king of scotland  really 
[00:41:30]  and he had no  security nothing  he's like just on  the side of the  road as the local  king is coming  through the this  this little like  town you can't  even call it a  town a village  yeah could have  just pointed at him  said kill him  it was some of  these pictures were  so scary and i'm  like wow man what  did the government  escort you around  he goes no i just  kind of wandered  around and wanted  to check things out  for myself i forgot  what country he was  in somewhere in  africa africa  excuse me and and  the local king's  coming by and  they're all praising  him and he's in  the back of a 
[00:42:00]  pickup truck or  something  an old toyota  machine gun  and the picture is  of people just  going nuts  and he's  unless there are  other people behind  the camera the  only white guy in  the area  yeah of course  he's insane  he got someone the  coolest birthday gift  uh ever i can't  say what it is  because it might not  have given it to  anything yet  but uh he got  an ashtray made  of uh gorilla hands  yes gorilla hand  and then he took  the ashtray and  slapped their face  with it  he's a great gift 
[00:42:30]  getter like he just  he gets you really  weird stuff signed  right yeah donathan  rules but he's  there's something  wrong with him  didn't he meet  fidel castro too  oh yeah yeah yeah  he had dinner with  him and he had  dinner with fidel  castro how did how  did he get that to  happen by being an  adventurer yeah he  had cigars oh yeah  i told you the story  right he had cigars  that was fidel gave  him a box of cigars  signed them right  actually signed cigars  from fidel castro  signed box of cigars  that's gotta be worth  a few bucks it's  just it's it's  irreplaceable so he  would keep them in  the humidor at david  the head of uh my 
[00:43:00]  management company's  uh office and david  would have cigars  sent to him on the  road and uh apparently  his personal secretary  didn't realize what  these were and she  sent fidel's cigars  to the other manager  and threw the box  out  and david just smoke  them not knowing  he had no idea of  course how valuable  these things were  they didn't realize  like a month later  because they were in  the humidor and  jonathan's like where's  my where's my box  and everyone's like  but i threw it out  and you can't even  really talk to him  about it because he's  emotionally he can't 
[00:43:30]  handle discussing it  right did he kill her  he went no i think he  had to go home  who's that really he  had to go home  well as far as  memorabilia go that's  gotta be up there  oh hell yeah if you  had to sign fidel  castro cigar jimmy would  that be the the  greatest possession  well it's the box  um yeah  or the box  well the box i think  yeah big scar box  yeah sure  i don't know i mean  i have some signed  stuff that's amazing  my prior autograph  i'd probably prefer  even though castro  is harder to get  right oh yeah  but uh  there's not as many 
[00:44:00]  yeah there's a photo  with him shaking  hands of castro i mean  he met him  i uh i took a cue  from your book  uh you you have a  richard prior like  uh canceled check that  that is one of your  prized possessions  it was from uh  yeah it was it was a  it was uh not a  canceled check it was a  residuals check from  the mod squad  right by like a  uh aaron spelling  productions which he  never used  seventeen dollar check  so i thought that  was really cool  and um uh when i was  growing up uh pistol p  maravich was one of  my heroes  so uh my girl got me 
[00:44:30]  a uh a canceled check  from p maravich for  some plumbing work  clogged his toilet  did he  old pistol p had an  odd diet  it's definitely it's  definitely his  autograph uh i i got  a i'll bring in the  details probably tomorrow  but it's a it's a  plumbing company for  some work he had  around the house  strange for like for  like two three hundred  dollars but it's it's  definitely a check he  wrote let's pay for  this work end up on  the market i know it's  like this is just a  check that you know  wrote it's uh it's on 
[00:45:00]  my wall and it's kind  of in a weird way it's  kind of creepy yeah  it's almost it's kind of  too personal you know  it'd be bad if you just  had a if it was just a  signed picture or  something but it's  still cool as hell you  know but no doubt  all right uh we got  to take a break  eight seven seven  two one two on a is  our phone number uh on  the way uh fine little  fine little segment we're  gonna we're gonna do for  everybody oh yeah it's a  bit of a bombshell it's  gonna make a lot of people  look really really bad and 
[00:45:30]  um you know and uh and  that's all i'm gonna say  for now and we'll discuss  it next so uh stay there  opian anthony  let's have some fun  you're checking out the  opian anthony show  starring a little jimmy  norton who's ranting and  raving as the commercials  play it enrages you right  i'm so irritated this  because for your chick to  wind up in the paper but  it was just so easy for  someone to do their god damn 
[00:46:00]  jobs these lazy lazy  sleaze bags in the media  don't do their job you  stink at your jobs you're  not men who do your jobs  no really irritating they  could have easily contacted  the show and gotten a  comment we tried for no  you didn't you're lying no  one tried to contact us  you're lying that i know of  anyway maybe maybe they  contacted some i don't know  it used to be it used to be  about finding facts and and  reporters i guess uh were 
[00:46:30]  proud of of getting a scoop  and getting to the bottom of  something nowadays it's all  about just like i said they  send an intern out to pick  up some some video off of  youtube they use old b-roll  that they shot a while back  to do another uh fat person  story uh it's just there's no  reporting being done anymore  that like like jimmy said the  simplest thing would have been  just to hit the phones sit down  at your stupid desk hit the 
[00:47:00]  phones and start making some  phone calls to people and and  try to get to the bottom of  something but they don't do  that because they they don't  know how they're not  journalists they're news  readers and one of the themes  of uh this fine radio show is to  call these idiots out yeah we do  it all the time with local news  we laugh at this channel 11 here  in new york we think uh we think  it's more of a comedy show than  actual news we make fun of seeing  it we we go yeah we go after these  guys and it affected me personally 
[00:47:30]  yesterday so now now it's got to  get ugly because i finally had it  i've had it with uh ex-employees  trashing us after we did nothing  but help their careers and help  them financially over the years  you know there's people that have  it out for us i get that but why  don't you write that in the paper  like well the reason we're doing  this is because we really don't like  those guys and actually we we kind  of have an agenda we're kind of on a  friendly basis with another a huge  radio show why didn't richard  johnson uh print that yesterday in 
[00:48:00]  page six before he went with these  lies because it's easier and uh it  makes a better story and more and  more people are starting to realize  that chauncey hayden is a hack when  it comes to journalism you know and  he'll get his in the end trust me on  that trust me because he's quoted in  this article yesterday that he how i  read the article from yesterday he  said he saw a sex tape okay all  right and then there's dope because  he's an attention-seeking you know  what he actually calls mike back from 
[00:48:30]  fmqb you could go to fmqb.com  mike got an exclusive interview with  chauncey he calls him he mike calls  me yesterday he goes i'm gonna try to  get him on the phone i go yeah right  it would be good luck i'm like who  would be stupid enough to call you  back  yeah he calls back because he's  desperate for attention and mike goes  so uh chauncey uh about this tape and  he admitted we have it on record he  admitted he never saw a tape and he's  going by the word of some disgruntled  employee of this radio show that that 
[00:49:00]  a tape uh yeah if that doesn't show  that chauncey has some kind of agenda  i don't know what else to tell you of  course he does and this is where it it  was beyond frustrating yesterday i go  back to my building people that that  live in my building people that work at  the building they're all asking me  questions and looking at me and i'm i  have to explain something that i  shouldn't have to explain so i'm like  look i'm not letting this die so we  did some simple stuff yesterday simple  stuff yeah that the news could have  done right should have done right and 
[00:49:30]  uh uh one of them was to get mike on  the case and uh you know he got  chauncey to admit he never even saw a  tape and then uh the guys were working  hard behind the scenes and they hunted  down bam margera yeah and uh we got  audio bam margera you know talking about  this thing he has no effing idea about  a sex tape he admitted that he did a  couple sex tapes in his life the one  with i think with an ex-girlfriend and  his uh current wife yeah they're on the  internet doesn't know my girl never met 
[00:50:00]  my girl he he said he read the page six  article and he thought it was laughable  he goes obviously someone trying to you  know get back at opie and anthony and  this is what really bothers me all page  six in the post had to do was give him  a call or give us a call yeah but that  doesn't make for good reading because  they have it out for for this radio show  ladies and gentlemen bam margera bam  yo hey brother sorry to get you up so  early oh no problem i i uh kind of uh i 
[00:50:30]  was on the phones all night yesterday  and uh people were saying man he wants  to call you a show but uh seven o'clock  is pretty early for this guy yeah yeah but  i could do it so uh you read the new  york post article yesterday yeah i i think  it's nonsense i mean i blacked out a few  times and uh i i'm like maybe 40 girls  buying my ex-girlfriend's back but if i  filmed it i filmed it myself i'd never  even heard of those dudes and i i would i 
[00:51:00]  would pay one hundred thousand dollars to  see it myself so bring it on well i got i  got a hundred thousand for a simple copy  of the tape i don't even want the  original because i don't want people to  think oh he's trying to buy the tape and  then uh you were asked last night if  you heard of a couple people that used  to work for the opian anthony show and  you're like i'd never heard of those  dudes because there's uh it was it was  suggested that uh that uh what that they  dealt directly oh yeah they dealt bam  yeah yeah they dealt with you to get the  sex tape yeah i never i i never met those 
[00:51:30]  dudes and if i did i certainly wouldn't  let them film me humping someone and if  you did have a tape you certainly wouldn't  give it to these guys oh hell no  yeah yeah put it out yourself did i  don't i don't think i don't think  where's she from philadelphia yeah philly  from uh originally but uh she's been up  in new york for three i don't know three  plus years at this point as far as i can  remember i only hummed a girl named tanya  with a bunch of tattoos in new york 
[00:52:00]  see everyone knows you're you know you you  you get your action i just don't want  i just don't want to be associated with  that i i really don't think it's true i i  would match you on the hundred grand oh  right on man and uh did page six ever  contact you no that press puts out  nonsense all day long right yeah and  they and it's so easy to get in touch  with some of these people but they don't  they don't report anymore they don't  actually look for facts anymore it's 
[00:52:30]  ridiculous all bollocks big time well  dude you've had like a lot of rumors and  stuff thrown at you so i mean this is  certainly not the first time that  somebody's report something stupid on  you is it  yeah can you uh bam did you hear jimmy  uh medium say it again oh this is not  that i mean you've had rumors and stuff  thrown at you this is certainly not the  first time that they've reported  something ludicrous about you that  wasn't true  oh yeah they just type whatever they  want  yeah i you know i and we understand 
[00:53:00]  that i mean we're in the public eye we  do a pretty popular radio show and  and they've they've printed a lot of  crap about us that we just know is not  true it's like i whatever kind of come  you know goes with the territory but my  my girl has no desire to be you know  famous no desire to to be in modeling  according to the page six article she  was looking for some exposure  it's probably just some jealous dude  at the radio show would you say he got  fired i'm sure that it's all true  there is no tape right well he's a very 
[00:53:30]  disgruntled employee this started about  a year and a half ago and it was so  ridiculous i'm like no one's gonna buy  into your crap and then he somehow we  got uh page six's attention uh here in  new york city and it's not like this  page six is buried in the you know in the  back of the paper this is like this is  pretty much the only page people will  read in the post that they're gonna  pick it up yeah yeah makes for more of a  titillating story they if they check the  facts they'll find out that it never  happened and it's not as good a story so 
[00:54:00]  they stop many negative people out there  in the world they need to they need to  quit what like for instance why sign up  and and make a flimpbiscuit.com like if  you don't like limb biscuits and don't  like limb biscuits go do something like  don't sit at home and be negative all day  go do something people just love and  especially with the internet man they  just love bashing the hell out of people  because they because they can't look at 
[00:54:30]  you in the eye right if their time to  talk nonsense because they know that they  won't get caught but if you flew into  their house talk to them right to their face  and say what have you done they would have  nothing so it's happened so many times  they're the biggest pussies on the internet  they can just you know write whatever they  want and then you see them out at an  appearance or something and they're your  best friend there can come up and shake  your hand and talk about what a fan they  are and then they'll just go back and and 
[00:55:00]  beat the crap out of you on message boards and  and started a bunch of it's it's bred a  bunch of cowards uh the internet yeah i  just uh in westchester uh at fairman skate  shop i just did like an autograph thing for  like 500 people and like a few kids had like  little pieces of wood and they're like  they're like yo man what's going on do you  do you know where this piece of wood came  from i'm like probably my fence and then  they're like oh yeah and i'm like you know 
[00:55:30]  like i have to pay for that to get replaced  and like  that i think that it's awesome you know  like and in their head they probably think  like hell yeah i have i have a piece of bam's  fence like  you know i'm like you're you're an idiot get a  clue  oh that's hilarious though sorry to hear about  your fence  hey dude how is uh steve o doing i heard  that there was some kind of like an  intervention on him because he was gonna  like take a motorcycle and jump from roof 
[00:56:00]  to roof is he all right is he like you  know is he straightening up a little bit  uh yeah he went to the loony bin i don't  know if he's out yet  loony bin but he when i saw him he was he  was doing better and like he was laughing  about the whole thing which is fine but  yeah we've had him on the show numerous  times and he's just uh i tell you he  doesn't disappoint on the radio but  you kind of look and go wow is he on the  path to a self-destruction  yeah he he was on the path of gg allen  right you guys are all pretty like out of 
[00:56:30]  your minds i mean it's it's like you know  it's kind of hard it's almost like you know  ozzy standing out in the heavy metal world  of being like he's way beyond where anybody  else was as far as being like an alky what  what what finally made you guys go all  right look steve here is is a problem he's  gonna he's gonna drop dead well anyone that  entertains me is people like andy mccoy from  hanoi rocks or pete doherty or uh villa  val from him you know like they're they're  just entertaining to watch and i mean it 
[00:57:00]  just think about if your life was on a  camera all day long what would you want  to see like i certainly would want to see  somebody wake up and jump off the second  story into their couch and who cares you  know that's what i do and my bones hurt  because i've broken them so many times  that you know yeah i either need like  um tylenol uh uh arthritis thing or maybe  like the shot of crown royals once in a 
[00:57:30]  while can i tell one of the biggest laughs  i've ever had in my life was watching  jackass 2 and i i think it was your cousin  when you guys were at the rodeo who was  it that the bull ran him into the wall while  he still had balloons in his hand that's  ryan dunn yeah that might be the biggest  laugh i've had as an adult a grown man  being drilled into a wall by a wild animal  holding balloons yeah god damn you guys 
[00:58:00]  make me laugh that was funny yeah he he  he thinks that he's not funny anymore and  he doesn't want to be on camera and i told  him dunn you saying that you're not funny  is funny yeah that guy is just faint it was  such a great moment i mean uh you guys  really uh fantastic man bam i don't know  why we've never had you on the show because  you kind of fit in with this whole uh this  whole radio thing we're doing yeah i'd be  on all day long the only problem is that i  wake up at maybe noon or later yeah i  didn't think we're gonna get you on today  because people like uh you're like oh seven 
[00:58:30]  o'clock oh my oh that's gonna be tough  yeah but i read it now like i'll talk in  two seconds but i really you're a stand-up  guy uh bam i've really i've heard good  things about you from some of the other  jackass guys and uh you know i greatly  appreciate uh you coming forward because  you know this really affected my chick she  was beyond bummed and uh i just appreciate  that someone did the right thing for once  yeah i totally 100 believe it's not true  and i'll match you on the underground cool  so no sex tape with my girl there are a 
[00:59:00]  couple sex tapes but they have nothing  to do with my girl right  not i i if i i don't even know what she  looks like there you go and you don't  know these guys that uh that claim they  uh negotiate with you for the tape no i'd  never let anybody film me unless they  were my good friends i like the fact that  that the funny part of the article was  that the two ex-producers or whoever it  was like uh uh uh we uh we we got him  just like we now have possession or  so i said they now had possession of yeah  yeah they like negotiated and bought it 
[00:59:30]  from you is it was it just sounded fake  it's just a bunch of people that want to  stir you up yeah well i guess we don't  have to uh ban you from our show anymore  that's good because that that was out  there in the article too that we banned  you from the show i'll be honest i always  wanted uh bam on the on the radio but i  thought like because you do you still do  that show for serious oh yeah yeah every  every uh monday at seven yeah and we're  on xm so it was like it was kind of like a  conflict of interest we got friends over 
[01:00:00]  there we would love to have on our radio  show but it's it's bigger than us like  jim brewer is still a really good friend  of ours and and uh barry williams is over  there now and these are guys that used to  do our show we just can't have on anymore  until maybe this merger goes through or  something i don't know yeah yeah and that  was pretty much the only reason that we  never had you on the show yeah i i'd be on  whenever you want what time what time is it  on from seven o'clock to when you show  uh seven seven till eight and i play  probably three to four songs and the rest 
[01:00:30]  i'm just talking about what happened that  week and what i'm up to and all that stuff  it's on faction 28 nice all right anything  else you want to promote bam um yeah i just  did a movie called where the f is santa i  went to the arctic circle in rovinemi  finland and i got the real santa cause and  i brought him back to pennsylvania and uh  had a big party with all my friends and uh  missy bought me a tour bus for for christmas  and uh yeah it's sitting outside i'm looking 
[01:01:00]  at it  and then uh a movie called ming hags which  is almost done and it'll be out uh very  shortly all right how do you know you  found the real santa claus because there's  a santa house and it's the real santa and  everybody thinks it's from the north pole  there's nothing there but a pole with ice  he lives in rovinemi finland in the arctic  circle fact  fact now that's a fact  and uh you're gonna be in new york anytime  soon  um yeah because because that's where they're 
[01:01:30]  editing the uh where the f is santa movie so  i i gotta come up there in like maybe three  days  well once you come in and uh do our show  we'll we'll talk about other stuff besides  this crap  yeah oh and one more thing uh i'm doing a  movie with james cox he's here right now  uh he he did wonderland without kilmer and  highway with uh jake glidehaw and jared leto and  uh he's doing a movie called dream seller with  me and uh i'm playing the part of novak this  heroin addict so i gotta lose like 10 pounds 
[01:02:00]  right now  good luck yeah no kidding all right bam i know  you want to go back to bed i you don't even  know i i really appreciate this yeah no problem and  anything you need from me uh you got if we can  help you i don't even know you're you're you're  doing just fine with except this chick yeah yeah  yeah anything yeah thank you anthony anthony always look out for me  although if there is that much money floating around mine may be available  thanks a lot thanks bam i see it all right man have a good day 
[01:02:30]  you too  and margera everyone stand-up guy  yeah that's pretty cool  also want to thank uh matt and joe's uh two super fans for  really uh helping eroc with this behind the scenes  yeah that right there is what anybody in the news could have done  they could have just asked him right there you go  we just did more reporting than uh any news agency  than the newspaper uh it was it was it was not a problem  especially if you're a news person we're not news people have you noticed 
[01:03:00]  if you're a news person you could probably get that done in half the time  uh that it took uh this show and the people involved  this is this is gonna hurt me because he's really really helped me out in the  last 24 hours but let's be honest if eroc could do this  why couldn't the post exactly why couldn't the post just do just basic  crap and and make a couple phone calls yes but that doesn't make for good  reading you know plus the fact that uh 
[01:03:30]  the the i i personally think there's an agenda there  i i i personally think uh that page six doesn't like us whatsoever we know  chauncey hayden for the most for the most part  it doesn't like us he's full of bull nagel as i like to say  oh jeez uh chrome entertainment.org is the plug today for the the super fans  chrome entertainment.org thank you uh matt and joe  you have no idea those guys like really stepped up  they they they hunted down uh bam's father to get a hold of bam 
[01:04:00]  there was a connection there and what we were going to play for you this break  was audio of the phone call that went down last night  uh and uh with phil margera giving us complete permission to play it on our  show to clear this whole mess up but then  uh we got bam himself he decided to get up and  and trust me if if we played this this phone call from yesterday but it's  pretty much the same yeah same stuff he was just you would hear in this uh  phone call oh man that's early i don't know all right i'll try  you know he's not a morning guy obviously definitely cool him 
[01:04:30]  and uh where's steve get steve in here really fast  yes hello  by the way uh we're gonna move on with our radio show that we do on a regular  basis and for the most part we uh we do a pretty good job with  but uh this whole uh issue i just want to make it perfectly clear it doesn't go  away after today i've had it i've finally had it with ex-employees  well you should i've had it with people with agendas i've had it with newspapers  uh printing i don't i don't even i still don't care if they print lies about  aunt and i because that's part of what we got ourselves into but when it 
[01:05:00]  comes to people we really really love and care about behind the scenes that  don't want to be any part of this that's where i draw the line people ask  me where do you draw the line that's it right there yeah and that's what i got i  got to do now you know we're on the air and stuff  i like to say it comes with the territory you know we made our bed now we got to  sleep in it oh yeah but uh you know your your loved ones and stuff like that  yeah the phone call the phone call to my girl's uh father last night was a lot of  a lot of fun for me and i you know i i called my girl's father last night oh 
[01:05:30]  yeah i will do whatever it takes to make sure her name is cleared and that people  suffer i just want you to know that but that's not a fun call to make i'll tell  you right now not at all because they're they're not in this business either they  didn't they didn't sign up for this the philly crew did not sign up for this that's  why chicks without dads it's my new club chicks without dads chicks without dads  i would agree with you but you know what big ken is a cool guy so you would you  would like him yeah well you met him one about needing a girl who has a lot of 
[01:06:00]  pain because of daddy issues right like i actually have a singles ad out now  because my girl and i have been fighting um do you love your dad if so move along  don't look here  so uh i i say we get that audio out to some people today  you know this is not going away uh steve what do you got you got  something that's uh going down now too well i've been talking with uh me  yes thank you they're questioning me in the murder of that trainer 
[01:06:30]  once again  i don't even know why i bother okay goodbye  um um i've been talking uh with uh chauncey online for the past uh 15 minutes basically just  trying to understand trying to figure out why he didn't call me back yesterday and  and why and by the way we have phone calls out to richard johnson too yeah he's obviously  blowing us off he better he but he better start hiding and uh you know just judging by the liberal 
[01:07:00]  use of the lol every other line right in the uh text conversation i would i would assume he's a little  guy is the biggest douche attention-seeking douche um but he has less and less credibility every single day  claims he never cleaned uh i never claimed to anyone i saw the tape just i've been told what may be on the alleged tape  uh then why why does the articles uh make it look like he saw the tape and that the action was nasty  why chauncey uh you're gonna have some explaining to do if a reporter asks me what i saw i can't be 
[01:07:30]  sued for telling the truth i was told by ex-employees that there is a tape but i never said i saw the  tape and i would never print that a tape exists oh stop you're backpedaling ass there's a lot of  people backpedaling today a lot of people backpedaling yeah it would have taken yeah i gotta say it again  it would have taken one phone call but see the see chauncey hates us page six doesn't like us so why  would they do that simple reporting one phone call to me anthony jimmy even our agent who's like a a 
[01:08:00]  a big time lawyer so you're gonna say a jew well the the jew you could have called it you could have  called the jew make my dad jew you could have called you could have called bob out there in la  and had a very professional conversation with him and he would have set you straight on what the hell's  going on behind the scenes with this ex-employee and and and the info we got on him in a huge file 
[01:08:30]  at this point claims that uh this whole uh issue this this article was emailed to you or this story  was emailed to you personally two weeks ago really and um no the rick delgado article was emailed it  wasn't even and well i don't know how we got our hands on let me make this perfectly clear perfectly  clear i do my nixon impression my 40 year old impression because of spam because of haters  because of many reasons i officially do not have an email account that is uh associated with this 
[01:09:00]  radio you can't you joined one transsexual site and it just all spam so so whatever  he doesn't have my he doesn't have my personal email that's the only one i have so whatever email  he claims to send it to doesn't is something that i am not associated with right right yeah because i  would just blow that off i like i wouldn't get someone involved immediately yeah that's uh that's  what i said to him i said uh it seems odd that you would have sent that to him and uh and he wouldn't 
[01:09:30]  have responded you know again a lot of backpedaling but i i asked him if he wanted to call in and he  said no no no i uh i don't want to get into a screaming match there's no screaming match no  there won't be screaming and by the way i uh at this point sorry sorry chauncey other people are uh  are controlling my actions and guess what i've been advised not to talk to you so so have fun in the  coming days it's gonna it's gonna get real fun for a lot of people uh once again bam thank you  that guy's a stand-up dude right there bam margera uh we're gonna continue with uh and thanks to 
[01:10:00]  irak more than anyone for doing all that behind the scenes irak one flag irak you you good you had  a fun night huh dude when i i was driving home uh this frustrated last night from long island i went  and saw my you know jd's baseball game my my nephew and uh i was like this is so frustrating and then  i checked my uh my blackberry and i got this email from irak oh my god professing his love 
[01:10:30]  pretty much my dearest semicolon when he told me what he had in his possession which we it turned  out we didn't need because then we got the the live interview i'm like oh my god  so we'll move on to other things that is uh that is going on in the radio world after the break okay  but once again to uh matt and joe they're super fans uh from chrome entertainment.org  thank you thank you thank you you have no idea what you did for me uh yesterday and i greatly

[01:12:00]  yankee stadium the new yankee stadium to be to be a curse to the yankees yeah one of the workers  admitted uh in a bar was it was it a bar in brooklyn or something he just admitted he said  that he buried a uh a red sox jersey in uh what the clubhouse or something the restaurant or  something oh in the restaurant yeah it was in a restaurant that couldn't even get it right  and uh he admitted that he buried this thing it turned out to be a huge story here in new york in  boston they dug up the jersey and they brought it to boston it was a david ortiz uh jersey and i 
[01:12:30]  believe they put where they they auctioned it off for charity on ebay or something well uh it's up to  about 90 000 for this jersey are you kidding me well it's for charity it's for a good cause yeah  in the end the money will go for a good cause but who would pay 90 000 for that i was just giving  the money and saving everybody the trouble no one cares there's no curse some guy put a jersey  threw dirt on it and now it got dug up there you go end of story hey uh jimmy your story 
[01:13:00]  moving on you're uh you're a huge fan of the cowboys what do you think of uh pacman jones going to  the cowboys yeah i don't know they like bad boys that they certainly do the cowboys love bad boys  the more likely you are to do drugs or get arrested on gun charges the faster they are to put you on a  plane they're so upset lots of criminals have uh been through that organization i can't keep track of  all of them yeah there's been a lot of uh nate newton went to jail for a long time for a pot van or  something or got in big trouble and eric williams was in some kind of trouble and they're always in 
[01:13:30]  laughing larry allen was a gangbanger on point or he was in a gang i just i love him my favorite  cowboy uh story tyson walter friend of the show who's he playing for he's got tryouts all over  the place we saw him we saw him in uh in cleveland actually he came to one of my shows at the house  of luz i'm not exactly sure he played uh center for the cowboys then he got injured then he was  playing for the packers it's it's hard to follow his career at this point but uh he's he's a great  football player he keeps getting traded because he makes the other men uncomfortable in the locker 
[01:14:00]  room and they won't get into why something something about his shower demeanor i played  golf with him once on the cowboys course they actually have a dallas cowboys golf course and  with it's all just cow it's cowboy theme like you know the halfway house where you get a hot dog and  a beer yeah they got uh basically the uh dallas cowboy cheerleader rejects working the hot dog stand  in the same same outfits and stuff but they don't look quite as good yeah the golf cart has a huge 
[01:14:30]  like uh cowboys like helmet oh god that must look instead of a roof like as the roof ridiculous and  then every driving in a big helmet yeah and the color scheme throughout the course is all dallas  cowboy uh colors and stuff whatever i i was fortunate enough to to play on this course with uh tyson walter  and we're on the range and bill parcells just comes up in his golf cart to hit a few balls before he  head out he headed out before he goes and busts a few yeah he was pretty calm that day but this  tyson walter uh could probably drive the ball 400 yards just i've never seen anyone hit it harder 
[01:15:00]  and further than he really oh it's not straight by the way oh you're spending half the day like going  two fairways over to the right or to the left to go find his ball it's like pin high on a par four but  it's way to the left or way to the right but anyway tyson told uh jimmy and i a great story who was it  the guy who had the brand new wasn't that's larry allen larry allen had had a brand new uh vehicle  i don't know if it was an escalator whatever but a mercedes something just showing hey i play football 
[01:15:30]  for the cowboys and he used his passenger seat not the seat but that area to spit out uh a chew  yeah he would just spit on the floor they were just on the floor just spit on the floor  he would chew the tobacco and he would use the passenger side of his car as a spittoon  basically it's a hundred thousand dollar spittoon he's uh yeah he just didn't seem to uh he didn't 
[01:16:00]  seem to care no harry allen was one of the best offensive uh linemen ever yeah oh hall of famer  let's say hi to drew in o-town bring it on brother o-town yeah what's up drew i just wanted to remind you  barry switzer getting caught at the airport with a handgun and his response was i'm the coach of  the cowboys like he should have uh impunity he's like hey i could get on a plane this is no problem  no it is yeah oh and i'm getting a report that uh tyson walter is still with the the packers uh t-bone 
[01:16:30]  from jersey go pack go uh thank you drew yeah i forgot about that one i'm out all right and let's say  hi to adam in connecticut adam what's up boys hey man yeah you got to remember hollywood henderson  was like one of the first guys to ever do blow on the field he had a little visine bottle in his  hip is this he would just do blow right during the game that was a vix inhaler wait jimmy you know the  story oh wow henderson during the super bowl i think 13 against pittsburgh he was on the sidelines  doing coke out of a vixen i believe it was a vixen it was acceptable to put that up to your nose and 
[01:17:00]  breathe right and uh but he was actually doing coke doing coke that's a great way to make your heart  explode let's do some coke and then get out on a field and get our heart rates up richard prior  helped even more actually get cleaned up i believe uh oh really yeah yeah yeah of all the people  prior i thought he helped him get coke that's what he meant and uh yeah he wrote a great book i forget  you know what his book was called bro no i don't but i just remember he would say like he loved to hit  people because he just wanted to break their legs because he loved the sound oh my god yeah coke will do 
[01:17:30]  that to you and then of course michael uh michael ervin had his hair share trouble that was with  the stripper or whatever you know that uh had a lot of problems in cowboys man all right adam thank  you so much all right have had their share it was called out of control confessions of an nfl casualty  by thomas henderson and speaking of sports uh we don't talk basketball much but kobe had 49  lakers beat uh the nuggets oh they did yeah i know i knew that was the response i was gonna get 
[01:18:00]  from you i'm sorry i what's your do you like any sports anthony we don't talk sports much uh yeah i i  what's your sport of choice i do i i enjoy baseball i just you know i i like going to the games i like  going uh on a nice day sitting out at the stadium that's like that's a fun time it doesn't even matter  you know if the game's really good uh or not you're just kind of hanging out friends drinking  some beers it's fun i like watching i like seeing the guys that uh go to the baseball games here in 
[01:18:30]  new york and uh they bring their new york times and they're doing puzzles oh yeah those are people  that like box seats or season tickets they're reading a book yeah they don't care catching a  few innings they're just getting some sun and some fresh air and watching a game they're just out  baseball is just way too slow for me i i really i really believe there's something there to like  make a 20 minute highlight package of these baseball games and and just to just i think i think that it 
[01:19:00]  would do huge ratings huge just like i know i know the purist they like the the pace of of the game  and the strategy and all that but there's a lot of people that if you let's say uh yankees red sox  although that's a horrible example because most people would love to watch the entire game but let's  just say a game like that whatever you did you put together a 20 minute package on espn or something  here's the yankee red sox game this is all you need to know not not quick highlights where it's  over in 30 seconds but seriously about 20 could chop it down to 20 minutes i think i think you would 
[01:19:30]  get a hell of a lot more fans involved in baseball not that they're they're doing yeah they're hurting  poorly but you know you know what uh they should do then uh i like when they do the the uh they show  the pitcher throwing strikes when it's kind of a when it's a long battle between the pitcher and the  and the hitter and they just show pitch after pitch right and that one was here here here just do it  like that you mean just show that well yeah like a big long and a few regular outs and stuff i mean 
[01:20:00]  there's got to be a way to edit it in such a way that it would be very interesting you know what i  mean not all highlights but not all uh boredom either i know there is a stat that uh tells you how  much actual game time how much game the ball is in play time uh there is compared to the length of  the the game travis could you find that we we had that on the show in the past yeah how much actual  time is spent playing the game it's ridiculous it's unbelievable the downtime and speaking of which 
[01:20:30]  hockey does this by the way hockey hockey when they they replay some of these games late at night  on some of these sports channels they do like these packages where you could watch like the  rangers islanders bruins flyers whatever but it's like a half hour half hour game but they get all  the action and all the important stuff cut out all the uh i think it's kind of smart because a lot of  people don't just don't have time to sit through a lot of this stuff i do want to follow their teams  we should do it with this show i like it we have a 10 minute program oh boy would i like that flyers  versus the canadians tonight uh travis's stupid canadians as he pumps his weak arm in the air it's not 
[01:21:00]  yeah i know he pumps his little twig his little hockey stick  poor little guy absolutely he's been forced to um root for a team that i know he doesn't  really appreciate he's just have a loyalty to because his wife is canadian he's a sports cuckold  yeah he's a sports cuckold here comes travis oh to defend him very excited look at him very  excited listen how weakly he tries to defend his uh yeah this is our we're going to game four 
[01:21:30]  oh what in philly oh it's game four no we're going to game four oh you're actually going to the game  yeah next wednesday with canadians shirts of course why that's not smart why not the philly fans are  nice no they're not oh boy i i animals i've spent a lot of time in philly in the last few years they're  animals terrible i know boston likes to brag about being hardcore and new york likes to brag philly  they're animals down there i know they're absolute animals they've made uh new york and boston kind of 
[01:22:00]  calm down they've uh really been strict i mean new york and boston used to be atrocious to go to  yankee stadium that's i mean that's where you were talking the d-cell batteries come out sure and uh  start flying onto the field uh but they kind of calm that down but philly they're still just animals  yeah they're just doing their thing still what i hate is that they started banning some of these uh shirts  you know you know not not a big red sox fan but definitely would root for the red sox over the 
[01:22:30]  because i'm a met fan and i kind of like the fact on both sides by the way the the abuse that these  t-shirts that came out making fun of the red sox or making fun of the yankees i thought they were  hilarious and who started the ban one of the stadiums uh started banning the shirts yeah like  let the fans do whatever the hell they want how about you ban the booze so people don't see a shirt  throw something at somebody shut up you nun drinker you know what i'm saying no i don't  i have no clue yeah you're gonna wreck it for everyone but that's a funny line though come on 
[01:23:00]  how about you have an a.a meeting at the thing those drunks you're pumping liquor into can handle  seeing a shirt from an opposing player and not want to yeah punch him in the face yes you can't you  can't you can't go to yankee stadium with a red sox jersey without having your throat cut  how about that he's being a buddinski there uh i know trying to take our beer away at the uh  stadium there jimmy what's wrong with you i don't care if it goes with baseball it does i'm sure beer  you know you're watching some of the beer and a wiener somebody get me a wiener before i die  i'm in cuckoo's nest i'm all for that all right uh let me put it in a perspective maybe you can 
[01:23:30]  understand i think they should take all porno off the internet oh i agree i'm trying to quit  trying to cut down are you are you making a run at quitting that uh jimmy it was starting to look  like a piece of play-doh that a little kid had just squeezed that fingerprints in it  oh my god they have the patch for that you put it over both eyes okay hold on i knew that was  gonna tank hey um i didn't get it uh to quit i got it 
[01:24:00]  how do you not love jimmy norton please he's the best okay  uh thank you fan uh sports illustrated uh columnist yells rick riley timed the 2000 playoff  game the baseball was in play all right let's do a little guessing now how long they like to have  a little fun in their cars three three hours 15 minutes i'm gonna say that how long all right  three hour and 15 minute game officially from the first pitch to the last pitch how long was the 
[01:24:30]  ball in play jim norton only two hours and 58 minutes  i i completely expected that by the way anthony i'm gonna say  seven minutes we'll tell you after the break no just kidding don't don't do that i'm not how he  in though um 12 minutes and 22 seconds okay that's a long time i'm kidding of course 
[01:25:00]  12 minutes and that's why they bring the new york times to the the ballpark and uh and a good read  out of over three hours yeah 12 minutes 12 minutes 22 seconds that's the what this guy timed uh back in  2000 and uh really fast about banning shirts uh we should mention that today in the paper uh bettman  gary bettman nhl commissioner you like this uh gary bettman there travis no idea who he is i have no 
[01:25:30]  idea who he is ask your wife see if you you should like him you she'll tell me what i think she would  know and she would give you can we get her on the phone yeah she knows way more about hockey than  you do oh she has to teach you and i'll have her call maybe dexter can uh talk on the phone and i hope  she throws you under the bus because i know she's teaching you the rules of hockey i told you that  i've asked that is really really awkward why sad kind of it's kind of sad kind of gee god bless her  that she knows uh hockey so well but she shouldn't be teaching you it's the law should i learn on my 
[01:26:00]  own you should fake it should i wikipedia hockey absolutely that's uh that would be a start but uh  talking about uh hockey faking the fact that he likes girls you sell icing all the time no matter  what's going on icing icing talking about hockey and uh and shirts they're banning um  gary bettman is banning the uh the sean avery uh shirt you remember sean avery from the rangers yes  who was doing that move in front of uh was it brodeur yeah he was kind of what was the move again 
[01:26:30]  yeah he was kind of trying to block his view going face to face face to face people are firing pucks  close to 100 miles an hour at the goalie back of his head he's face to face with uh brodeur  and he's waving his hands and stuff in the air distracting the goalie trying to uh block his view  yeah look i hate the rangers i hate them just as much as i hate uh chauncey hayden no way but  sean avery you gotta give it to him i think it's i think it's brilliant yeah but then they made a 
[01:27:00]  rule that you're not allowed to do that in hockey right and now um people have started uh wearing  these shirts called the avery rule avery avery rule number 16 and then there's a hockey stick across  just uh read to you basically saying you know you're not allowed to do the avery thing anymore  yeah well now gary bettman has banned these shirts from being printed or whatever why because because  they want to take all fun out of sports but you faggy and everything you know fun is being removed 
[01:27:30]  from everything just surgically removed i'm a huge fan of uh the sack dance and football huge fan when  these sack dance oh huh but huge ball joke never mind i thought gasino used to make a complete fool  of himself but it was hilarious to watch at home i love when they score a touchdown and just lose  their minds in the end zone looking ridiculous and and the the trying to they they took most of that  away yeah the celebrations and stuff that's what makes it really really interesting destino was a douche 
[01:28:00]  oh when he would sack somebody and just do that stupid dance i know thank god he found boxing  yeah he was sacking his women we allowed the yankees i get pretty crazy i go to a game like i'll start  yelling like no batter no batter wow could stop it yeah i've been thrown out a few times ladies and  gentlemen travis's wife the man in the family although you don't look like a man lisa i don't want  people to confuse that right a lovely lovely lovely girl you wear the pants you certainly wear the 
[01:28:30]  pants of the family when it comes to hockey now take us nake take us through this whole travis all  of a sudden liking hockey thing because i know lisa's a hardcore core uh montreal canadiens fan  originally from montreal and all that um there's not really much to say about it he uh just kind of  jumped on board you know like i'm so obsessed that i always want to watch it and listen to it  and follow it so he kind of what was for me what was the most awkward moment the did you have to like 
[01:29:00]  explain icing to him or something like that no he was pretty good he's like you know travis and like  his research abilities so he yeah self-informed himself like uh-oh well i told him i've asked questions  before yeah well i mean nothing but a boy's gotta learn boy that's not the first time that she's  heard that that's a role play thing they do by the way when she walks in with a special belt on 
[01:29:30]  a boy's gotta learn gotta learn oh travis you've been a bad boy you gotta go into the penalty box  he's cuffed face down buttocks in the air boys gotta learn how's little dexter he's oh who cares  for his walk this morning hey oh you gotta stop talking about poor little dexter yeah yeah yeah  these guys are pretty harsh on dexter for the most part they're a little dog what do you mean these  guys what i've jumped on that i think i'm just harsh on you and your your mommy issues but that's true 
[01:30:00]  i've kind of left your dog alone for the most part i also want to drive a dump truck over that  stupid jack bauer turtle oh i know they got a turtle the name jack bauer oh yeah of course because  he's such a gay fan that was my fan boy yeah i know it was your idea it couldn't possibly be  leases no here's a little sound effect uh from little dexter  oh oh little dexter know what i love about the turtle 
[01:30:30]  how annoying is that bauer owned by ass and off  i got it i what i hate about this uh this cute couple though they're they're attempting and so  far they they have failed miserably by the way but they're putting up uh videos of dexter onto youtube  hoping it's the it's the next animal sensation video the big sensation yeah the big cute animal 
[01:31:00]  video that everyone in america is gonna watch uh i hate to tell you guys quantity doesn't make up  for quality you guys are pimping out your little dog no like i've said before we don't make him do  adorable things he just does them himself oh god and if we want to videotape him you guys are like  you guys are like parents of like a child star you're pimping your own oh he is a child star oh is he  yeah what's what's your favorite uh cute dexter video that you're attempting everyone to watch oh  jeez i can only pick one uh shut up i do i do like the one where he's uh we put our turtle jack 
[01:31:30]  bauer on the floor and uh and dexter was barking at him most of these videos involve dexter barking  at something so a dog barking wow that's really gonna take off it's adorable do you check the  views every day and it's up to oh no it's up to 34 views lisa i didn't check the views until uh  until a couple days ago but they're they're getting into the hundreds you should see how 
[01:32:00]  many rounds i could put through his ears yeah because uh he's got real big dopey looking ears  but but lisa anthony's just trying to pierce uh the ears for you that's all i know it's all right  that'd be easy it's all good 45 caliber piercing that'd be bad hey uh lisa one other thing when you  go to game four down in philly yeah you might want to leave the canadians jersey at home oh  hell no you're one of those people that's crazy yeah we might have another ikea this could be an  ikea situation that's crazy yeah if we have like another ikea situation someone's going down and 
[01:32:30]  it's not going to be me that's going to be travis we all know that all right let's walk you through  this so you wear your canadians jersey down there in philly and someone throws a beer on you what  happens well it's not going to end there i'll i'll be throwing shit back to you oh no  i forgot where i was he's cursing she forgot i forgot where i was right oh what a potty mouth  all right well after you uh you know get the attention of all the security guards in the area 
[01:33:00]  as travis is trying to figure out what to do for you travis is going to be putting out fires all over  the place just i'm sorry she's drunk i i'm sorry i don't she'll be drinking because it's wednesday  night so i have to drive because it's wednesday night wait i can't you're trying to say at least  it drinks every wednesday night no that's not what i'm saying at all oh but uh you know i have to be  at work the next day yes i won't be able to drink and then drive home from philly uh-huh so she  anthony are you listening to this by the way not at all i didn't think so not at all 
[01:33:30]  but she will definitely be drinking see that's called responsibility  respo i'll figure it out so so she drinks every wednesday night so the game happens to be on a  wednesday night so lucky you're gonna have to drive back and forth to philly yes yeah that's gonna be  i'm gonna be a very good girl i promise i'm not gonna start anything have fans are nice we're nice  we don't go places and start crap with people we you know we're very respectful to the other team 
[01:34:00]  we're the ones high-fiving at the end like good game you rioted after the first five what happened  they rioted after the first round you saw it on the television oh my god i'm so disgusted with my  city right no you're not no you're not a police car that's what you want from your city and i gotta  tell you until just now i wasn't thinking about that the video is of everyone losing their mind in  montreal tipping over police uh at least one police car setting it on fire and stupid me because my 
[01:34:30]  my team's long gone i swear to you when i saw that i'm like oh oh wow the canadians won the stanley  cup i'm thinking no it was after the first round first round and they're flipping cars over and  burning them yeah like 16 police cars or something they're idiots i'm so i'm disgusted i'm ashamed  almost to say i'm from montreal but what can you do right this will mean nothing but i uh i've been  to a lot of cities uh across north america and montreal is probably probably the coolest city i've 
[01:35:00]  ever been to my god have you ever been there jimmy a few times you don't like it i like it they got  that old section that's cool then the new section is is really hip yeah it's great lots of lots of  things to see and do toronto stinks toronto for some reason decided they need to live in the year  1967 i'm gonna call it toronto is like the tijuana of canada it really is it's it's it's like a tourist  place that you go to if you're from the states just to get like sleazy entertainment toronto no 
[01:35:30]  montreal's got some action no i mean like like but not good action i'm talking about toronto like  the actual city yeah it's very bland the colors are very neutral the the uh the the the stuff that  women wear extremely neutral like it's like 1967 really like the amish it's just weird they have  no pizzazz they have not that pizzazz huh they try to be like our city too like apparently they have 
[01:36:00]  their own little time square now in toronto they're pathetic they all they do is take things from other  places and try to put it into theirs and make it appealing for outsiders because people who live  there even don't like it when i lived in buffalo you know it was very exciting when we got to do  the day trip to toronto boy was i disappointed on many occasions except for the strip clubs with a lot  of a lot of a lot of a lot of asians uh dancing their asses off in uh in toronto strip clubs for some  reason yeah yeah yeah there's more asians there i think than montreal there's a lot of asians in 
[01:36:30]  toronto what are we talking about you see this adorable video yeah we see the video oh god no  there's uh there's your little dog barking at your little turtle i wish you would have bit the  turtle's little head off yeah you know that he wanted to oh i wish that turtle was a landmine  hey where do you live brooklyn oh you're lucky why do you want a turtle what are you doing it  and you know what you know what you know what annoys me i say you're lucky because supposedly  they're banned in jersey or something uh according to ralph oh by the way uh ralph thank you 
[01:37:00]  thank you thank you thank you why are they banned bellville they're um thank you they're  boring people to death you're in an apartment yeah you have people who live below you below me yeah  and you're letting your dog bark on a wood floor and bark and jump around they don't hear it at a  they don't hear it yeah talk to our neighbors you do yeah well what's wrong with you he does yeah  because a turtle walks very very softly well the dog is that shell and those those those those 
[01:37:30]  hooves they call feet whatever the hell they're sporting doesn't make a clump clump clump clump  clump as it's trying to find its little water dish but what about the dog yapping no kathy doesn't  hear it kathy lives under us and she's a sweet old lady we live in a generic or a geriatric generic  well you're really that's why she doesn't hear you a lot of old people old people in there kathy  also thinks that you're you're her long lost daughter my granddaughter's come to visit  kathy stinks yeah we don't like kathy literally she thinks that he's dirty 
[01:38:00]  kathy lays on her back with her feet up in the air waiting for a changing yeah  yeah stupid turtle kathy needs the pillow over the face yeah how great would it be if the turtle  just attacked and killed travis and lisa one night it just went holistic slowly nipped them  like the bear it just nipped at their little throat so they slept through it yeah after after game four  they're both in a drunken stupor because travis is not gonna be able to help himself and the turtle 
[01:38:30]  just starts nipping away all night long and you wake up when it's too late because he has half your  liver in his mouth killed by a turtle how embarrassing it would be embarrassing all  right lisa uh uh i gotta say go flyers you know that but thank you no no it's a good one but it's  actually good for you but uh you know have fun in uh philly for game four thank you even though game  one is tonight right so you guys got when is game four wednesday next wednesday yeah oh they're playing  them fast huh yeah yeah every other day see when your team's out but you kind of lose track thanks lise 
[01:39:00]  by lose track i mean don't care hey uh lisa i i we did forget to ask you is travis uh affected by  mommy leaving seven years ago uh you know what i'd say no um i don't know if you mentioned but my  mother turned around and did the same thing like a year ago uh to you oh wow oh you guys didn't know  this no no holy moly so so i meet travis and you know i i discuss with my parents like you know don't 
[01:39:30]  go too much into the mother thing because of da da da and uh my mother was just horrified how could  a mother do this she turned around and did the same thing just last year she disappeared and left the  family she's now in court with my father it's a big mess but uh wow same thing where did you and travis  meet on disappointing children dot com motherless children dot com oh that's horrible where's mommy 
[01:40:00]  dot com you as you're telling her the story she's probably you know saying oh that's terrible but in  her head she's like this is a great idea why not just pick up and leave i think that's what it was i  think i think that whole story put the idea in her head and she just decided i hate my family everyone  can drop dead and forget you all and she just took off did she leave with like a rabbi like uh  like no no she's actually now my father has um has reason to think that she's turned um bisexual 
[01:40:30]  and uh he's playing like both ends of the yeah and she's like apparently living with some guy  cheating on him with another guy and some chick so wow man and what travis is uh why do we have to  take a break right now we need to know more and what's dad doing is he uh at least you know going  out no my dad my little sister is five years younger she's still living at home with my dad  and they're pretty much taking care of each other and stuff but uh no no there are certain things that  the daughter can't take care of is what i'm saying well you know you know what my mother wasn't doing 
[01:41:00]  much of that either so oh wow all right i hear you what tipped you off lisa like you were saying  about travis's mommy like do you believe she left and you just your mom went really  left no without any repercussions yeah nothing happened she just left and she has to deal with  her she came to a realization that it's an actual option she's happy i could actually leave  hey we're so late for a break uh lisa we're just touching the surface we're going to have you on 
[01:41:30]  in the very near future but uh a little advice from uh looks like johnny rangers johnny hey look i've  seen the philly fans pull opposing jerseys off children so she thinks she's going to be safe being  a female i hope travis is packing i can't wait for next thursday's show we will get the full report  after game four from travis and lisa what happened in philly all right johnny thank you  all right oh sorry and uh lisa we gotta let you go thank you so much yeah no problem guys take care

[01:43:00]  maybe they were practicing practicing some of that worker they were practicing congo  workers uh i i pray you do a little more of that after the break oh i can't one of my favorite things  uh well uh arrested 13 sorcerers accused of using black magic to steal or shrink men's  men's uh men's uh penises yeah wow yes sorcerers are doing that in the congo with their 
[01:43:30]  that's right interesting young boy named known as harry potter that's right they're using their  wizardry to give us tiny genitals all right we'll get into this next they go you're asian ta-da  hopefully well i i know at least half the audience heard that line of course opie and anthony  uh we're back with the opie and anthony show thanks for checking us out today thanks to the faithful 
[01:44:00]  uh yesterday when i was dealing with all that dealing with all that bs and yeah you gotta make  believe you're hearing this for the first time by the way we do that on this show  we already discussed this stuff at ad nauseum before yes um somebody that was helping me out  with my situation that has quite a lot of power is batman yeah batman oh all right yeah batman  who was helping me out yesterday he was uh away on business and oh i know who you're talking about 
[01:44:30]  by business you mean drinking heavily and uh  batman gets a call from his uh wife batman's wife  and she got into a bit of a situation and man is batman pissed yeah and i don't know if he's  ready to talk about it on the show yet but i'm sure he will basically uh batman's wife 
[01:45:00]  was uh dropping off or picking up a little bat girl at school how old is little bat girl  wool wool bat girl like two and uh batman's wife had to jump into the car at the last second like you're  watching an action movie like a stunt man like a stunt man jumped in the car with uh with the kid  to protect and make sure the kid little bat girl was uh safe and sound and just as she did that and 
[01:45:30]  got out of harm's way i i do believe the joker came flying by and took batman's wife's car door  completely off the batmobile right off the batmobile wait a minute you're not using real names  that close took like complete disaster so she's got the kid in her arms yeah she's opening her 
[01:46:00]  door yeah you know the kid in exactly and a car comes precariously close to her parked car  she jumps in the car just in time for the other car to rip the door off yeah which would have taken  her the baby and the door yeah did she jump in the car defensively or she just happened to get in  i don't have all the specifics but how it's told to me it was it was pretty much what ant just jumped in 
[01:46:30]  pretty much like a stunt and the door came uh i guess either completely off or bent you know all  the way forward obviously it's forward and i don't know if it's shut i don't know yeah exactly  do you think i stop at least or do you know like you know i there's more details but i guess that's  all we could say now did she jump out and go come back here you sumbitch  that door is evidence valuable evidence and for the most part when we teach something we we we get  the rest of the story on the air so within the year within we do that yeah exactly um but uh i 
[01:47:00]  hopefully this person will come on the air and tell the story because it's amazing and hopefully he  he tells the radio audience what he told me yeah yesterday what he wants to do with this guy that uh  almost basically almost killed his wife and kid not not a funny matter and i'm glad he's okay i'm  glad his family's uh just fine what was it was it was no no just some random dude driving by not 
[01:47:30]  paying attention wow uh we we teased this before the break so uh penis theft panic hit city yes it's  odd that this would happen in a place like uh in uh uh kinshasa uh you know in the congo the congo  probably they're very superstitious there well police in congo have arrested 13 suspected  sorcerers sorcerers what is a sorcerer well i know uh in order to reach one in um some of my uh 
[01:48:00]  multiple uh online role-playing games um it takes quite a a lot of time to become a sorcerer  but i don't remember the spell for um for uh genital shrinking yeah that's uh what this story is all  about so well uh throw cold water on your back oh oh we don't know sorcerer we don't know the name of 
[01:48:30]  this character but he's on the show right now we never named this character because he doesn't really  like doing this character that often even though even though i don't know a couple of the main members  of the show strongly suggest that he should do this character a little more than he does  i occasionally when there's a chance to discuss wizards we're very happy to do so  but that's how you shrink a man's genitals you throw cold water on his back or you scare him  yeah you get shrinkage well mr sorcerer what if uh the person you're throwing the cold water on 
[01:49:00]  his back decides to take one of those pills huh i don't know what pill you mean oh oh you know  a viagra a viagra or a cialis that would wreck your spell my friend no it wouldn't his arms would  stiffen instead and they've accused people of stealing penises i know what happened to them  they became employees of this show good one 
[01:49:30]  we'll just stay stay right there mr sorcerer we'll have a name for you within 10 minutes i don't need a  name i'm mysterious he is very mysterious he's very mysterious you don't want people  know much about you well i come in like the wind and i leave as such as such  i don't know why that cracked me but as such yeah all right well uh police in in uh the congo have  arrested 13 suspected sorcerers accused of using black magic to steal or shrink men's penises 
[01:50:00]  uh after wave of panic and attempted uh lynchings triggered by the alleged witchcraft how do these  people um live on this planet with us yeah at the same time we have we have iphones in our possession  and this is going on basically on the other side of the world yeah the other side of the world uh  we don't know much about about the other side of the world here there's uh you know you take for 
[01:50:30]  granted you look outside look at look at the buildings being built there's aircraft there's  uh automobiles all kinds of technology in use and right in front of us i mean just the miracle  of the internet and uh televisions that we're watching everything and then right there on the other  side of the globe there are people being arrested for sorcery for shrinking people's genitalia and for  stealing them occasionally you'll see a man with a long overcoat and he'll go and he'll open his 
[01:51:00]  jacket and he'll have seven or eight penises for sale like wrist watches but why would he why would  he why is there a market for this why would he be selling who doesn't like to have an extra one for  the weekends you put it behind your ear like a pencil or a cigarette  he's very mysterious under your nose like a fake mustache  we gotta work the word mysterious into his into his character name yeah he's very mysterious i 
[01:51:30]  just don't know what his name would be though i enter a room like a vapor  it certainly did during break when you were standing next to me sorry i got nervous  and and leave as such i do i leave i leave through vents he casts his spell through the back of his  pants yes i do it's called a pucker a pucker ran out of steam didn't you didn't your character 
[01:52:00]  praise for me uh report i should have a name instead of mysterious i should call it right before  you try this remind me to to take my magical pen and jot things down next time instead of trying to  wing it well i like puddle of aids he uh you know you got uh i don't know there's uh another member  of the show that does a character called jimsy uh puddle of aids is suggesting that your name sir is 
[01:52:30]  jimsydry or jimsydry or jimsydry that's a stupid name who would ever close that it's really stupid  ridiculous uh report do you know who had tiny genitals who sam from quincey it's common knowledge  i've heard tell that yes reports of so-called out in the sun would hold a magnifying glass over sam's lap 
[01:53:00]  uh reports of so-called penis snatching are not uncommon in west africa africa where belief in  traditional religions and witchcraft remains widespread and where ritual killings to obtain  blood or body parts still occur they are like groups of of savages there are groups of people that  have not become civilized i guess right that is the oddest thing in 2008 you would just assume 
[01:53:30]  that everyone would be up to speed the congo is a wonderful place if you'd like a hat made of bark  i'd like a bark hat i was once there and i said where's the restroom and they pointed a tree  this place sucks who would like the congo nobody uh well rumors of penis theft began circulating last  week in kinshasa kinshasa kinshasa democratic republic of congo's sprawling capital of some eight 
[01:54:00]  million inhabitants sprawling uh they quickly dominated radio call-in show they got radio call-in  shows in in the congo yes if you've ever seen hotel rwanda they use their radio shows for  different purposes cut down the big tree or something squash killed the cockroaches they use it for  genocide gets big ratings one of the favorite talk shows is called 
[01:54:30]  they're number one  well they quickly dominated radio call-in shows with listeners advised to beware of fellow  passengers in communal taxis wearing gold rings beware of fellow taxi drivers what i don't know  this is this is right out of a harry potter the congo uh is stupid and then sometimes the two males  will fight for dominance and the right to mate with the female 
[01:55:00]  but if yours has been stolen then you're kind of uh out of luck you certainly are yeah i think  uh nagel out of luck uh if they've stolen your genitals you have to become a corporate lawyer  see that make a point well i see that i bring it don't i uh purported victims 14 of whom were also  detained by police claimed that sorcerers simply touched them to make their their uh genitals shrink 
[01:55:30]  or disappear oh and what some residents said was an attempt to extort cash with the promise of a cure  uh who's believing this police arrested the accused sorcerers and their victims in an effort to avoid  the sort of bloodshed seen in ghana a decade ago when 12 suspected penis snatches uh snatchers were  beaten to death by angry mobs yes all cultures are equal on earth and we should respect all america  should be multicultural because so many other cultures bring a really interesting flavor to our 
[01:56:00]  country oh look the mob beating the man who stole penises through wizardry those are people we need  here welcome them with open arms why why isn't this on tv i gotta explain this person doing this uh  wonderful character he closes his eyes like like gilbert godfrey and then he looks up to the heavens as  he talks and it's almost like his nose is pushed up as he just as he goes into his mouth a little 
[01:56:30]  bit uh i'm tempted to say it's one huge joke oliko says i guess he's uh okay he's the police chief  the police chief is saying i'm tempted tempted so that means there's a there's a there's a doubt in  his mind i would say it was a joke let me go cut this chicken's throat first and see what he says  too bad jimmy's in character right now because i'm sure he'd have a lot to say about this no i 
[01:57:00]  wouldn't or he wouldn't yeah exactly uh but when you try to tell the victims that their penises are  still there they tell you that it's uh become tiny or that they've become impotent  that old gag to that i tell them that's a great excuse i wish i'd had that one all through high  school i'm sorry i was cast a spell upon it's not that i'm frightened and insecure about this 
[01:57:30]  and afraid that i don't quite match up to your basketball player ex-boyfriend it was a spell was  put on me yeah while i was in the congo i wasn't toilet trained for too long and too harshly that's not  what dude my lack of function yeah the spell's called the white man's disease right  oh uh but when you try to tell the victims that their penises are still there yeah they tell you  that it's become tiny or that they become impotent to that i tell them and this is the police chief 
[01:58:00]  uh talking how do you know if you haven't gone home and try what how do you know if you haven't  gone home and tried it to see if it works yeah there you go lovely story out of the congo who's  going to the police saying that that happened excuse me i'd like to report something stolen uh-oh what  my penis it was taken on the subway by a man i was watching a three-card monte game  and the next thing you know it was gone 
[01:58:30]  wow they are really uh really smart and civilized there could i describe it let's see it was last seen  with headphones and a virus cap but that's what erock's wearing new new new character sorry yeah  well now that the uh the story's over uh what's what's this guy's name you don't know but he's so  mysterious it's time for you to disappear and vaporize into the vents yes i know i saw the break 
[01:59:00]  sign all right we'll watch you disappear now go ahead do your disappearing act nope you're still  here that's the noise i make when i disappear i'm invisible no but you're not invisible i am so  no all you see is two floating headphones no we see you you're right there i said a belt above where tiny  shrunken genitals would know i anthony's right there right you don't see you don't see headphones just  dangling in the i actually yeah yeah i'm seeing headphones really kind of dangling maybe he's 
[01:59:30]  visible just to you well now that i look a little closer i could kind of i could kind of see through  you so the spell might be working i've disappeared no not quite all the way much to the joy of certain  message board people i think you have to make that noise a little more and then you'll completely  disappear nope almost one more that's all i have that's it i think we all know this hit the wall  five minutes ago well we don't like to stop do we no we've lost everybody ppm is down is it 
[02:00:00]  no actually it did quite well yes i know but i meant after this bit oh okay yeah ratings were kind  to us yesterday very kind and very kind for this station new york thank you like wow they might be  on to something finally here in new york we've only been here two years opian anthony  we gotta mop up we got uh a few things to cover before we get out of here oh gosh you're missing  the bar being thrown around in here oh well we were just reading about uh atlantic city finally banning 
[02:00:30]  smoking right yep they have these uh smoking areas down there but it didn't really do any good because  the smoke doesn't know when to stop uh floating around it would just yeah you float over to where  you're doing your thing and not smoking well there'd be non-smoking tables which is hysterical it'd be  right next to a smoking table this is a this is a weird one for me because i i uh i don't smoke and i 
[02:01:00]  and i hate cigarette smoke uh jimmy was just talking about uh how it's it's so good to to do your comedy  and not go home smelling like cigarettes but it's also i forgot how weird it is on your throat like  i'll do an hour in uh like one of the best crowds i've had a long time was clutch cargoes in detroit  but there was smoking i mean it's just they still allow it in pontiac yeah and it was like i did like  an hour and ten i wanted to do more but it's like it's like you can't talk after walks my body is not  a remember those days your your throat would be dry and you you felt like you were getting a sore throat 
[02:01:30]  and we were saying remember the days where you couldn't even like just throw your jeans on the next day  let's say you just you know i don't know you you just want to like do a few errands and throw the  jeans on your head on yesterday you're not really give a crap what you know people are thinking about  you and you couldn't even do that because they would just smell so bad from the night before  right cigarette smoke and all that okay i think with the blood on the zipper  but this is a weird one because i personally i hate uh i hate to smoke and all that but i don't i  don't think you should i don't know i don't think the government should be able to 
[02:02:00]  tell you what to do with your establishment like restaurants and stuff like that and  clubs yeah i kind of felt that in a free market society i'm thinking if you're a restaurant owner  and you want your patrons uh to be able to smoke if they want to you know then there's other people  that don't like smoking they probably wouldn't go to that restaurant after a while that was the  argument for a while but then they went after that the workers are being affected and and i don't know  yeah dude i'm not i'm not a self-righteous sex smoker but the tobacco companies have been so abysmal 
[02:02:30]  and it kills so many people and it stinks and there's you you can't i'm sick of hearing about  smokers rights and i smoked for 17 years 17 wow i smoked for a long time man so i know what  you're going through believe me it's been 17 years without a cigarette in my body you know the fact  that voss says drink or drug in my body i want to drill my fist in his midget face like we're supposed  to go god almighty yeah oh oh louis beans you're not an inspiration i saw dove last night at the 
[02:03:00]  comedy cellar who knows chas very well and we was just telling him about voss's awful and i just  couldn't do it louis beans louis beans you know louis beans you read john john you read no inflection  buy these louis beans i'm hal from 2001  it's terrible dub's gonna be on our show and we'll have to it's another excuse to play that  course it is coming in i don't know yeah i think he's scheduled i think he's coming in very soon  hey uh a few things we want to just quickly get to here uh colombo yeah peter falk is uh what are 
[02:03:30]  they saying about it him the headline crazy colombo said rant on la streets do you know anything about  this uh apparently he's 80 years old um he was on the streets in los angeles just yelling  incoherently babbling with a a button up shirt that was four sizes too small for him with his  gut hanging out his buttons ready to burst um and looking very disheveled and dirty 
[02:04:00]  and uh just yelling things out in the street the reporting yeah he was spotted dazed disheveled as  you said and uh he he babbled nonsensically to himself yeah babbling to himself well did you hear  what he said uh he was like uh there's actually audio it was something like uh uh hi uh this is  colombo and uh what are you looking at wow that is exactly well i'm not sure yet close i'm gonna  close my eyes uh do that again hi i'm peter falk as colombo and i hate to bother you wow 
[02:04:30]  if you close your eyes you feel like the guy's in the room with you it's amazing yeah as he headed down  the street tuesday with his belly sticking out from a two sizes too small pledge shirt god i love  this guy now he uh waved his arms magically  one witness uh told the daily mail of london that he looked disoriented and at least one person was so  concerned about his condition that uh they called nine uh nine one one uh when authorities arrived at 
[02:05:00]  the scene a short distance from fox beverly hills home which is on the tour you take one of those little  oh yeah yeah they they'll drive you by his house uh they examined him and decided that he didn't need  any help whatsoever really yeah i would think he uh if he was that uh i don't know crazy he would need  help so that's all we got on that i just like jimmy's um peter falk peter falk impression when the  cops showed up they're like hi i'm lieutenant colombo can i stop bothering you he does these 
[02:05:30]  impersonations i swear you would think it was the real people yeah you would swear yeah um  well we got a uh amusement park going up in baghdad  exactly you must be this tall to ride and it's the length of a head yeah exactly yeah if you're too  tall they just lop your head off and put your headless body on the ride beheading one flag 
[02:06:00]  that's the new campaign in uh six flags they got rid of you know yeah you know that old  fogey yeah they got rid of him why i thought that was working well for the company uh it probably did  probably did for like you know five minutes but now they got like this this asian guy that's like  popping his head out at you it's probably one of the most offensive i think you'd think the asian 
[02:06:30]  community would be all over this one no but they're too busy going after radio guys are just  trying to make a few dumb jokes it's this stereotypical asian guy that gets really mad  uh when they show something that isn't very fun it's for six flags they got them all over the country  uh they they show something that isn't very fun and he gets real mad or mad face and he just says  something like this one flag what's one flag wait so like six flag six flags is like you're having a 
[02:07:00]  ball one flag is is for something just no one's enjoying that's not fun uh two flags also not very  fun two flags two flags is better than one flag yeah and notice the kung fu punch noise before it  yeah two flags see that's being stereotypical of course it is where's john lou where is john lou john  lou and then if something and then they show like people at uh six flags uh and he's very happy now 
[02:07:30]  now he's very happy six flags ah that's the right place uh six flags very much fun and now the ultimate  uh uh he now he's happy six flags more flags more fun more flags more fun uh and and we cannot get  enough of this commercial in the office oh boy because it's just it's it's a stereotyping of an asian  gentleman and quite hypocritical when it comes to people that are trying to shut down uh uh others from 
[02:08:00]  just having fun with yeah with uh certain ethnic groups that's jack caffety though and he's still good  right yeah he's hanging in there god bless you for doing the right thing hey uh uh uh e-rock's uh  participation uh on the opian anthony show uh anything on that e-rock's participation let me  see this would be the fun-o-meter one sec oh oh oh oh but but but he did a lot of uh behind the  scenes stuff for us last night as far as that controversy we talked about earlier today

[02:14:30]  we're off to xm today yes we're doing a live show and uh if you're not joining us over there have a  great day bye  before you get pissed off at us man we have nothing to do with this  what what is this garbage you know what i can't take this anymore it's an awful awful radio show  we're really really mean-spirited evil people who can't see the good in anything off the air let's 
[02:15:00]  say racist things to each other hold on hold on and really turn them off  excellence in broadcasting our anus what again oh oh our anus what stop enough about the anus ah  this is hurtful this is hardball no one wants to hear this on their radio show come collapse on our 
[02:15:30]  floor  it's just potty mouth day you may feel shame but all the same  you're on my knees in pain  you guys ready to laugh it's gotta be the greatest thing ever 
[02:16:00]  i'd sooner have a water drinking contest but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the  road here we are xm satellite radio and i gotta tell you walked in and we got two animals in studio  at the same time two animals randy couture and uh pat cooper right i don't know who i'm  more scared of they they both could destroy you 
[02:16:30]  pat can make you feel like a worthless nothing and this guy could pretty much take your your head  off your body they both remove your manhood differently he does it physically yeah or just  humiliate you while you're on the ground verbally yeah you're right what's wrong pat  first of all uh-oh you're the animals you and him oh me and your partner the  fucking animals yeah why don't start and give us this crap first of all the gentleman on my right  yeah randy couture yep happens to be a gentleman unless he sees an iron cage they don't tell your 
[02:17:00]  balls other than that i'll take him on outside the cage but in the cage that's his business yeah  in my cage that's my business i'm funnier than he'll ever be but he can knock me on my  ass so we're on you know we're on even terms true pat cooper walks in looks at randy and goes i'm  pissed at you this is the first words out of this guy because if i didn't say i'm pissed at you he  knows it ain't me he goes you never gave me a title shot yeah how long do you think you last in the 
[02:17:30]  ring with him i wouldn't last right now i ain't last again and i'm about seven feet away from the man  is mma he is he's the man yeah and i'm not here to flatter him because i'm a big fan of that i only  worry and i say this you know with tremendous dignity and respect that someone don't seriously  get hurt that's what i worry about because in wrestling they've had problems a guy from 90  feet wants to jump on a guy's ass do it on two feet what's the big deal but these gentlemen and 
[02:18:00]  women this young lady from vegas this italian girl is dynamite gina carano thank you i love her i uh  i would i would marry in three seconds but she could kick my ass and so i changed away they  got women in ultimate fighting oh really wake up it's thursday i don't like that  wake up schmock why you got a show and you don't know what the  because i'd rather watch men fight they have women in mma now gino will be fighting on the 31st on  elite xc on cbs actually no kidding all right so if they got the women involved next step is uh 
[02:18:30]  the midgets i'm thinking the midgets midget ultimate fighting but there are randy there  are different venues in and in uh cage wrestling am i correct promotions in other words if you if  you're mma you could be excess sex or w3l yeah so but who's the champ in this fucking world i don't  know the strongest brand is still the ufc they've been around the longest and and there's several  other players coming up that are doing shows are you still holding a title uh i i resigned from my  heavyweight title with the ufc you know something i'm glad you did i'm you know why because i think 
[02:19:00]  right now you've done it all and i think right now you're more important to the game because you have  a great name of people like you and you got a nice smile so don't fuck around i uh why did he resign  why did you resign i don't know that story oh another thing i don't know pat i'm sorry i'm trying to  facilitate uh you know everybody wants to know who the number one heavyweight in the world is and and uh  the old pride brand from japan their heavyweight was uh fedor emilyenko and the ufc couldn't sign 
[02:19:30]  him won't make the fight happen uh and at this stage of my career that's the only fight that really  makes sense for me i probably have one maybe two more fights left and you know 44 see the end you  know light at the end of the tunnel so we're trying to find a way i have to get free of the  ufc in order to make that fight happen 44 you said can you merge can all of them merge they can do  like well i don't know if they can merge but i think they i think that uh we need an independent  ranking structure so that uh and then the exclusivity that a lot of the promotions like 
[02:20:00]  the ufc use and who's considered rage is considered the number one man uh oh yeah rampage is the number  one guy in the light heavyweight division who's that for the ufc the heavyweight champion in the ufc  right now is no gara antonio no gara but who's the guy that was never beaten from russia somewhere  fedor yeah fedor that's the guy i'm talking about that i that i'd like to fight and uh kind of  you don't want to quit you gotta break balls for 20 million dollars you should step in the ring but 
[02:20:30]  for less than that it's ridiculous you guys don't get paid enough why would you fight fedor there's  a footage of him being dropped on his neck he got dropped on his neck i want to say it was kevin  randleman he dropped him on his fucking neck and the guy just got up and it annoyed him now what  yeah it's like a paralyzing drop that's right the fact that you really are pursuing uh getting in  the ring with him you know i'm becoming a fan every day every day i'm becoming more and more of a fan  and i'm learning as i go here because i i didn't i i'll tell you the truth and i say it to all you  guys that come in when ultimate fighting first hit i found my edge this the things you guys would do 
[02:21:00]  to each other i'm like i can't effing watch this and then they finally got some tap out rules and stuff  like that i i go back when it first started where you just watched like what you thought was the  guy's face by the end of the match yeah but now that i hate to admit it but now that there's some  rules in place and some tapping out i'm really getting into the sport yeah i think the problem  with the old version of the sport was we had a lot of mismatches there were guys that said they  were this and that and on paper and then they didn't really breaking arms and legs right on tv  i'm like some guy in a bathrobe beating a guy in a suit exactly uh one boxing glove and you know but 
[02:21:30]  it's weird like ups workers just regular guys getting the shit out of each other right and then um  when we talk to these guys we mentioned pride like all sudden like you know everyone gets  scared like he's a ufc ufc guy you can't mention pride what's that i don't know what that's about  no there's an old brand rivalry the old owners of pride you know they were the biggest brand in  in japan which is a huge market for the sport right and then you know here in the u.s the the strongest 
[02:22:00]  brand was has been the ufc for a long long time so there was this always this rivalry and that's kind  of where the fedora fight comes from too because he was the heavyweight champion of pride yeah  uh you know who's got the best fighters they had a little bit different rules they fight in a ring  we fight in a cage we can drop elbows they can soccer kick and stomp sure it was all these questions  that were being asked and now uh the ufc bought the pride brand and kind of killed the brand and a lot  of those fighters are now coming over no gara was you know he's the heavyweight champion now in the ufc he 
[02:22:30]  he was a pride fighter rampage was a pride fighter several other you know former pride fighters have  come over henderson uh crow cop others and and and not fared well but some of them have it's amazing uh  uh you know i mean randy you really are a legend in in that i mean you've beaten everybody i mean uh  you were one of the three that liddell wanted to event you know i mean it's like you've beaten tito i  mean you fought everybody uh there's nobody you seem to be afraid of well i've i've had an amazing ride  in the sport it's been a blast and uh i've had some great fights and fought some very very tough 
[02:23:00]  guys it's been a lot of fun who hits the hardest why i mean it's it's hard to say that the interesting  thing about being knocked out is you don't remember a lot and chuck you know chuck managed to knock me  out in the in the rematch so uh he must hit pretty hard is chuck still uh in the game yeah chuck's still  fighting he was supposed to fight uh rashad evans coming up but has sustained a hamstring injury i  think and pulled out oh in england right i think it was going to be in england it might have been  in vegas the difference between randy and chuck they're both animals you just look at me you know 
[02:23:30]  they're a major problem but what i like about randy he actually smiles which is good shows a little  more a little more you know human chuck we love chuck he does our show all the time but man that guy  does not smile we just want him to crack one smile he's uh he just sometimes he gets really quiet  you just hear him breathing it's like yeah like a bull he's just breathing through this  fucking savage face yeah just amazing what what's uh this is probably hack but uh what's the worst 
[02:24:00]  injury you had doing the ultimate fighting thing uh a few years ago i was fighting rico rodriguez back  when i was originally a heavyweight and i i caught an elbow in the in the fifth round of the fight  and fractured the lemur paprichia the thin bone between your sinuses and your eye socket  oh which wasn't fun that took a while to heal and then in my last fight i broke my ulna my left  arm and the the eye thing was worse than breaking an arm oh yeah a lot worse why just your vision  you're still you know you're messing with your vision and your eyes you know that's never never 
[02:24:30]  a good thing did you win the fight you broke your arm yes i did okay that was amazing to me i thought  so it was uh gonzaga who was the guy that knocked out mirko krokop who everybody thought was  unbeatable me too i was fucking billy bandwagon on this guy like no one will ever beat him  i guess the shit kicked out of him yeah um but he you were blocking a kick yeah you had your arm  broken and and and you won the fight like a mule let me tell you what happens let's say uh during a  break one of us walks to the bathroom and we you know we twist an ankle the show's over we go home  yeah to think you continued fighting and won the fight with a broken arm do you think the guys don't 
[02:25:00]  get hurt as bad as like in boxing a couple guys have gotten killed because they're taking 45 minutes of  punishment um but you guys are pretty much i mean the fights don't go that long because this is the  threat of an arm break and and it's done well i think the wrestling and submission aspect of the  it's in the referee's hand he's the most dangerous guy if you don't know his job you're absolutely  he's gotta know because let me tell you the last time i was in the cage ranty i didn't tap out i went 
[02:25:30]  gay so i don't fuck around i don't wait for the referee to control my life stay where you are why  it's over but this is what i worry about you've got some great referees there because if they don't  jump in in time and it's it could be dangerous that's what i look at the referee you guys don't  mean nothing anymore you're out of the picture we go there to see the referees see if they're gonna  annoy you guys i'm waiting for one guy to pick the referee up and show them out of their fucking 
[02:26:00]  cage yeah you're absolutely right we've had no deaths in the 14 years that our sport's been around  in the u.s market and and uh you know that's that's a great track record to have and we don't get to  sustain pounding to the head that the boxing sustained it makes it because of the wrestling  aspect the the grappling aspect of the sport it makes it really hard to watch uh boxing when you  start getting into the ultimate fighting game it's just hard i still love boxing i mean and i  don't know a mixed martial artist that isn't training in boxing it's a it's a piece of what we do but uh 
[02:26:30]  but when you see the boxing you know you you know the feet aren't coming up or nothing no elbows it's  all just you know i think the other dimensions of our sport is kind of made the sport look yeah you  kind of made the sport look you know look dated i mean uh people would argue and you know old  school and say you you got to be out of your mind but that's my my take on it anyway well cage  wrestling has hurt boxing in my opinion because cage wrestling is uh this is like uh you want to  with me in boxing you jab you step away you dance around you go in the corner you talk to the guy 
[02:27:00]  you get a minute rest you get up again but that fucking time the 12 rounds are over then the guy  says i don't know i could have beat him who gives a shit now hey what about the uh the welterweight  champ who turns around and knocks out this 300 pound uh uh wrestler give me a break what's his  name but weatherby you're full of shit what do you do that for because you ruin your reputation  he's over there hitting us 300 are you nuts this guy can pick him up and bend him in seven pieces 
[02:27:30]  so this guy who's a great fighter no question but he's a great defensive fighter this guy uh  weather mayweather sure you understand because there's so many  mayweather's i don't know which one is anymore so anyway randy we had enough of you goodbye  we have mayweather on the show that's timing and of course you should be scared of mayweather  right but yeah he's great we're more scared of his uh entourage yeah you're dealing with guys that  are so in order this man that they they over protect them and he's the fighter what the 
[02:28:00]  is a fighter need a bodyguard dude these guys why would why would randy need a bodyguard who the  fuck's gonna fight with this guy these guys were pay attention what about your partner he doesn't  even breathe anymore what happened you know you're absolutely right i had a little dilemma at the  house my alarm went off so i had to make sure somebody was over there taking care of it it happens  you know nasal to me uh no are you ever cold in the head no you sound down maybe it's my hearing  game but all right let's get back to well you know sound a little let's get back to talent 
[02:28:30]  i'll try to stop that anthony also has guns like uh randy but they're a little different so you know  he's well prepared for a home invasion well you know you got it you got to be prepared yeah if you  can't be prepared you know with muscles and stuff you got to have a superior firepower yeah pat you  got to talk to anthony you got it you got any pieces there you're italian you got to own a gun  right it's the law let me tell you something yes i don't fight with nobody we discuss things  i don't raise my hands to nobody unless you know what you're doing if i raise my hands to somebody 
[02:29:00]  i'm gonna kill you that's the way it is because my father says don't make a bully when you raise your  hands kill the mother so this is what you do i don't raise i'm a gentleman someone says you're out  of order i apologize i ain't looking for any problem that's why i went gay last thursday  now i'm looking for someone to unday me i'll see you thursday in my place randy  people don't fuck with you in public unless they're looking for a lawsuit like there's 
[02:29:30]  there's guys that would do that's probably their bodyguards because you know mayweather's making  20 million of a fight i'd take the beating for the suit i mean that's what people are those guys  that see you as a mark that you know you you know the rest of your life is in danger you really  have no then you can sit there and go you have to defend yourself to that but i got lots of money  i got lots of money isn't great i sold him and i got money let's go to the circus you're shitting 
[02:30:00]  into a bag for the rest of your life yeah it's not worth it good point hey uh what are we promoting  today randy red belt red belt yeah it's a sony classic picture uh written and directed by david  mammoth uh chiwetel edgeford's a lead character and it's a the backdrop of the movie is mixed  martial arts it's a a well-written typical mammoth movie with some you know subversion and some  things in it and not just a fight movie it is a really cool play kind of a an american samurai  story so this is your first acting uh seventh picture but uh the last couple i've been trying 
[02:30:30]  to steer away from just the thuggish fight roles and do some more serious acting obviously can't  fight forever so uh who do you play in this movie i play a an announcer dylan flynn that uh that ends  up fighting somebody come on no actually i don't fight in this movie so is that part of you like i  don't want to look i'll do the role but yeah i was i was interested first of all because it's a mammoth  movie i mean he's he's fantastic uh and i love the the plot of the story and i didn't have you know  it wasn't about the fighting for me i would love to have had voss in here though because our friend rich 
[02:31:00]  voss is a really bad actor but he was worse he took martial arts and i just wanted i just wanted  i i don't want to ask him to spar but i wanted to ask him to throw a kick or something for you just  to observe and see because he really thinks that he knows the martial arts and we just know that  he's just a deluded idiot and he's someday going to be killed trying to fight for a little man you  could have pat cooper do some of his uh kung fu moves for everybody pat let me tell you i like chinese  food that's as far as i go with kung fu and you know and mixed martial arts i like a mixed salad 
[02:31:30]  all this so much confusion everybody's beating the out of each other now he's  going into the movie business watch if he dances with the stars i'm getting  it's about time he laughs this guy here he's got a great smile a great laugh it's about time you know  and you've been working him for a few minutes he's a man of all season but it's raining a lot that's your  problem very very good so you're not afraid uh of of uh fedor no not at all i think i i think 
[02:32:00]  you can't be afraid of anybody if you're gonna get in that cage no yeah you have to go in you  know you mean people on the cage are afraid some guys are you can see that what the hell are they  going on the cage for yeah exactly are you crazy you see it in their eyes that must be something when  you see it in their eyes and just go i'm gonna beat that out of you yeah sometimes you can tell  you can just say oh you can see the doubt and fear yeah the guy's face oh god that's like when 
[02:32:30]  steve tries to produce that's when you can get hurt if they don't know what you're doing thank you  yeah i heard hey uh we got some randy fans online here let's say hi to jason in new jersey jason what's  up hey what's going on fellas hey hey jason i just wanted to say i saw an old episode of pros  versus joe's they had randy on it and before the show they introduced all the guys all the  athletes are coming out and every guy that came out before him all the people are sitting there  they're trash talking them left and right randy comes running out i swear to christ at least two  of the contestants pulled a big nagel in their pants when they were sitting there trying to 
[02:33:00]  watch randy on come out i mean their jaws dropped off have you guys watched pros uh versus joe's  it's a it's it's a pretty amazing show what do you do for pros versus joe's yeah they actually put  us in a cage we we did a five minute five minute submission round with each of the contestants  were you told not to hurt the guy why i think it's a big thing for the producers they don't  want anybody seriously injured so you know you know the concept right jimmy you know the concept  right yeah pro athletes go home and get a job who wants to jump in with this guy i'll get his man 
[02:33:30]  control himself you know with the video the producer the guy kicks him in the balls what's  going to do and start this fucking tweet tweet yeah he's going to break his fucking back i'm with  you it's very hard to control you because you're in that environment it wasn't bad i saw what you  were trying to hit him don't give me that shit randy i got you on tape you know pros versus joe's if  it's like you shooting free throws with lebron james or or taking on the bad mitten champion of the  world okay but going with the you know in a ring with an ultimate fighter and you're a regular joe you 
[02:34:00]  gotta be insane a porno chick i'd do that with like i dare you to suck my dick  how long did somebody actually last with you oh well i went five minutes with each of the guys it  was who got submitted the least amount of times in five minutes uh so what number was that 852  five six and seven so the guy that did only got submitted five times i think won that event five  times in how many minutes again five minutes yeah aren't you gonna aren't you supposed to have  something with i want to i'm off the memory is it kurt angle kurt angle is has been talking about 
[02:34:30]  getting into mma for quite a while and i have the opportunity to potentially do a submission match  with him uh this summer after i'm free from the ufc so i'm hoping to get a chance to do that i'd love  to choke the shit out of him oh i like that you would right there's something about there's also  audio of him i think it was angle kind of like uh talking about like uh uh how he thinks he would  do very well and liddell said that if we fought he's never been hit like i'll hit him like that's  actually true you know kurt has a great wrestling pedigree is a collegiate wrestler and he hasn't 
[02:35:00]  done that for years he was olympic champion he comes from a great wrestling background but i mean  we just saw brock lesnar who's also a very very good wrestler and how he fared making the transition  to mma and jumping in with a top guy yeah right out of the gates he didn't last very long so i think  kurt has potential if he wants to do the work and train and learn the things he needs to learn to be a  complete fighter but to just jump in with his wrestling pedigree at this point he's going to  get his butt whooped is near did mayor beat that guy with the with the beard yeah he did beat him 
[02:35:30]  he beat him he's because the guy with the beard is suffocative in crisis i don't know you want to  get in a wrestling match with this guy that goddamn beat electrocute you why is it he never had a fight  and the first one was a main event yeah but me beat him right yeah he did and pj did he went out in  out in london lj guy from hawaii oh bj penn yes he did not a great guy yeah not a great guy i don't  think i know what i'm talking about how do you know so much about let me tell you something oh  whoa listen to me when you're not working you read and watch you may get lucky and wind up on this 
[02:36:00]  show how about uh kimbo slice he's a great street fighter legendary street fighter on youtube black  dude really a tough fucking dude bare knuckle street fighter getting involved in uh he's with  elite xc and uh may have beat him right he's trained no mirror hasn't fought uh kimbo kimbo  hasn't fought any any top 10 guys yet uh they're wisely choosing his opponents and uh and bringing him 
[02:36:30]  along i think given some time he's going to be a very very good mixed martial artist oh really but right  now he's still predominantly a striker uh he's working on his ground skills he's working a lot with boss  rutin who's a you know a legend in the sport uh he trained with us for a while in the extreme  couture in vegas but uh great attitude nothing like what you would think you know seeing the  street fighting videos and stuff he's a very nice guy very quiet and and just comes in hard-nosed  asks a lot of questions and works hard in the gym so that tells me he's got the right idea he knows  he's not just going to walk in and beat the shit out of everybody so you guys don't resent him like 
[02:37:00]  i sense a little resentment like you talk about kurt angle almost like you don't  fucking come in with that i'm a star wrestler shit no no because kimbo doesn't come in that way  i mean he comes out and fights he's not scared of anybody but i think he's the first one to say  look i don't know everything there is to know in this game i'm still learning i mean i've heard him  do his interviews he he doesn't come in thinking oh i'm just gonna fuck everybody up he doesn't act  that way so uh i got no issue with kimbo i think uh i hope that elite xc doesn't take the street  fighting video and use that to market him because i don't think that helps the sport 
[02:37:30]  but uh but he's got a ton of potential he seemed like a nice guy as he was picking people up off the  pavement because he actually did a couple of times kimbo you've seen him fight right of  course you have anyone i was picked off off the pavement but not for that reason  let's go to the phones we got a bunch of uh randy fans checking in we got bill in kansas bill what's up  hey randy huge fan man i just wanted to know if there's a beef between you and dana  why i'm just being blown out of proportion dana white well i've got no beef with dana dana's dana 
[02:38:00]  you know i've been around dana for seven years now i know you know he's a passionate guy about  the sport and he's very protective of his brand and and uh i think sees me as a threat because i i  resigned from the ufc and so he's you know said some inflammatory things but i don't take it personal  and uh in the long run it all works out and and hopefully you know we'll change some things in the  sport and make it better but uh you know that's just dana he's gonna say things like that and do 
[02:38:30]  things like that what did he say i have no idea what he oh he you know he's he's made a lot of  things he's said a lot of things publicly about me because they want you know they obviously want  me to continue to compete for the ufc and it doesn't make a lot of sense for me right now so uh  you know he's he's called me this and that and you know it's not even worth repeating  bad yeah it's been a good one i'm not even gonna push that one you're not fighting as a ufc  fighter then if you fight uh uh fedor uh is he are you fighting under pride or you guys just kind 
[02:39:00]  of both going pride's gone the ufc bought pride and basically killed the brand so uh uh it'll  happen somewhere else we don't know where it's going to happen yet uh mark cuban is a third party  stepped up and is helping me file with the state of nevada to get a declaration on my contract and see  what the state thinks about when i'm free and clear of the ufc contract uh mark uh mark cuban rules by  the way so uh you know he's helped me tremendously in that in that regard and uh we'll see where  the fight turns up but it's going to happen that's great man hey let's uh get mars in here 
[02:39:30]  he's a huge fan before randy go uh ron in georgia what's up i had a question for uh randy yes what's  up ron uh the human weapon on discovery channel yes and uh they've done a test where you wrap  you you exert yourself for like five minutes and uh a normal person the creatine levels went sky  high and it got exhausted you were exact opposite what are you superman or something no they they  had a little trouble explaining why my lactic acid levels decreased when i was doing that kind of work 
[02:40:00]  i think uh they determined that i used my body naturally through training kind of adjusted which  muscle groups were doing the work and and uh i've managed to become more efficient to limit eliminating  that lactic acid that builds up when your muscles work um which was kind of unique and  surprised surprised me as well yeah that was that was the show where i didn't see it but i've heard  a lot about it where they tested you guys like how hard you can fight and all that right exactly 
[02:40:30]  fight science i heard it's a great show yeah very cool they did an amazing job it was really cool to  get all the guys together and and do the testing with the crash test dummies and stuff and right we  had a really good time do you do the elliptical as well i found that to be very helpful i have a little  sort of getting my heart rate up on the elliptical i go to i don't to an air diner or use the treadmill  a lot we do sprints on the treadmill how many uh push-ups can you push out there i don't know i  haven't done push-ups yeah we should try to do a manly thing with randy like what i don't even know 
[02:41:00]  put on dresses and hand our phone numbers over  pat an idea maybe something manly we could do it my only muscle is on my tongue  if i can't lick it it's all over that's the facts all these guys with muscles and breaking things when  i get out of bed that's my push-up when i get back in bed that's another push-up i don't give a  shit about my muscles about my legs i ain't running around the corner i don't give a  fuck i just want to exist when i'm breathing i'm alive this guy's got to fight beat the 
[02:41:30]  shit of the people i'm a multi-millionaire without raising my fucking hands so step outside you i can  take no are you a multi-million maybe i can't maybe i'm full of shit i don't know do you exercise at  all pat you've never you never got into exercising i don't exercise i was a bricklayer for 12 fucking  years bending down lifting the block bending down breaking apart why should i go after that after 12 15  years that was my muscles into this world it's fucking over so you don't want to lift up my 
[02:42:00]  coffee cup any fuck no more i don't want to be involved i don't go in his business he better stay  out of my fucking business he starts getting funny it's a problem oh randy that's a threat by the way  he doesn't know that i know little al and peculiar mary i don't fuck his brains up  hey mars is a big fan mars in studio martial artist hey randy um we spoke earlier and  uh pat covered a lot of stuff i'm surprised that you know so much of it and so does jim but 
[02:42:30]  i do have one uh question we all are looking forward to you fighting fedor win or lose if  fedor wins or lose with tim that's the fight yep you and him um you uh top no matter what even if  you lose to tim you're the top man but there is another guy that i i forgot to ask you about how  about josh barnett how about um trying to get that one back uh josh signed with affliction that  that shows happening that's where tim and fedor are fighting july 19th uh it'll be a huge show it's 
[02:43:00]  a great bunch of heavyweights josh is getting a rematch with pedro hizo who was one of his losses from  back in the day uh i know josh real well and it was a my first loss in the ufc was was against josh he's  a great fighter uh you know went to japan since then and fought a lot in pride and stuff and and  it's been hot and cold but it's still i think for a big guy moves really really well great submission  guy so i mean it's there's possibility there because the other guy that's also um probably 
[02:43:30]  that you would like but right now he's not doing so well as rico rodriguez and i think that's where  you got the injury yeah i had the fracture yeah to the eye yeah rico's rico's trying to get himself  back on track he's i think he's speaking french oh god no go go go yeah he's he's still around  still still kind of trying to climb back in shape and compete again at a high level and it'll be  interesting to see how that goes for him i have a question i smell another saturday virus show yeah  mars that no one will listen to go ahead though mars it's very interesting i'll out before i want to 
[02:44:00]  ask you uh do you uh do you like or dislike uh uh tito because i've gotten a weird vibe uh from  chuck about him uh weird vibe yeah you're making it sound vague he can't stand him well jimmy's not  sure if randy might hang out with tito i've always gotten along with tito and i think you know going  into a fight with tito he's gonna talk shit he's gonna talk smack that's just how he operates so  i wasn't offended you know he came out with a cane he did all kinds of stuff because of my age and 
[02:44:30]  oh i kind of uh i kind of expected that and gave a little of it back to him which i think caught him  off guard outside of of uh the limelight he's actually a very nice guy what was the result of  the fight i'll tell you who's finished i'll tell you who's literally got a spanking he got a spanking  yeah he got a shamrock he lost to the oriental kid a couple of weeks ago shamrock what is it i  don't know which one is frank kong lee and frank shamrock it was a great fight what was it this guy  outboxed him out he did everything but hit him with chopsticks yeah you're right i'm serious because i think 
[02:45:00]  the shamrock at one time you know but i think his days are over and i think he should back away  for a while and go into the nunnery the nunnery hey randy is the money getting better i think that's  one of the things that needs to change in our sport that the contracts are very exclusive they own the  fighters from top to bottom and that's and uh that's why you know i've got to leave the oc to make  the fedor fight happen you know the top fighters should be allowed to fight each other and you know 
[02:45:30]  everyone says oh you're kicking the hell out of boxing well that that's not exactly true you know  i think last year all the mma fighters combined in the pay-per-views for the ufc got paid 17 million  dollars mayweather's made more than that in one fight so yeah so it's it's not exactly accurate  yeah but it's becoming more and more mainstream and i would assume that would bring a lot more  dollars to the sport right well we hope that some of these new promotions coming up want to pay the  fighters better and give you know the lion's share of those fights back to the fighters instead of  keeping it in-house go on strike go on strike no the night of the big fight said we ain't going 
[02:46:00]  in that cage i want to see millions on the table then you're afraid that whatever the head of the  ufb a b c d yeah who don't like you fuck him and it's a well you don't own my life who the  fuck's taking these punches you sick bastard you must make it the man see you're tough in the ring  outside you're not you're a pussy step inside that's what he's doing now that's how come he's not  part of the ufc anymore that's part of what randy's doing he's fighting  how come this guy's behind me who the fuck is this guy 
[02:46:30]  i thought you were throwing your voice  plus the new sport compared to boxing i mean it's amazing how fast it's growing it's still growing  right because the guys like you and chuck who become like these faces off of the sport people  like because and you have to give ufc credit where credit is due they've changed the face of the sport  uh you know the tv show the first season that chuck and i worked on oh that changed the landscape  for mixed martial arts i got a question what bothers me on pay-per-view what happens in boxing a week 
[02:47:00]  later you see the pay-per-view fight on regular television uh-huh why isn't that happening on this  on the mma and all these pride shows why do we have to wait a year to see maybe you that fought  last week why can't we see the fight like sir and pierre fought last week why can't i see that  they'll do the reruns of the pay-per-view for the next month and then after that that fight will  show up probably on spike tv on a ufc i've been looking at spike and i don't see i don't want 
[02:47:30]  i still yeah it'll be a while they're they're still trying to sell the pay-per-views for a month  after the show thank you seven dollars what happened hbo is in negotiations to uh to to run it like they  ran boxing which i think would have helped uh both uh but did hbo want to run it and you have  well i think uh hbo is still very entrenched in boxing and and one of the few places where  boxing has been successful in selling pay-per-views and a lot of that i think is is because of golden  boy uh and and the matchups they're doing and and the 24 7 a lot of those things are doing to create 
[02:48:00]  an emotional interest in those fights uh and they are interested in getting into mma but uh they didn't  get along with dana that you know their control issues there and and uh so somebody will end up doing  a deal with hbo it will i worry when when jones made a statement that he may want to go into your  kind of thing and i think that would have been a big mistake although he's gonna fight for a title  like tom a couple of months no tom johnson oh you're welcome 
[02:48:30]  i don't know i come on this show this guy takes more naps  ron jones you dickhead  all right we should uh we should get uh randy out of here  randy pleasure meeting you man you too thanks for having me on randy you're a gentleman's gentleman  you're a credit to the sport and you got a great smile and let me tell you something when  you're behind the scenes and we hear you over you know analyzing the fight you give us a much  interest in it because you know more you know when they say a step over toe bending the thing i don't

[03:08:30]  were right dead get a fucking doctor they left those they left it went up again hey what's your  favorite restaurant in new york what's your favorite new york restaurant oh i got a lot of them don't  put me on the spot like how about one that you like to eat or two that you like to eat he's gonna  say patsy's he's gotta be a patsy's guy i got a lot of i got a lot of fucking rest i was the one last  night the first time i went to a place called bella blue on 70th street in lexington uh and they come out  with the fish you know and the guy said pascal hey who isn't the official look at the official 
[03:09:00]  before we cook it i said i don't want that fish he goes why i said he's looking at me i don't like  a fucking fish looking at me and i'm kidding him so i say calls the chef listen to this and the chef  says he's not looking at you he's looking at him but this is what they do so you pay for the  bullshit i was in italy twice okay it's bullshit the greatest food on the planet is in the city of  new york i'll challenge anybody to tell me otherwise if you can't get it in new york you can't get it 
[03:09:30]  nowhere you go to italy there they got there they don't know what the certain the uh flavors that we  have here we got 200 pasta flavors for christ's sake you know the only thing good about them that  sent us the pasta you know so they say now that's going up because they said there's a shortage of flour  why very simple now they want to make gas out of corns which means we can drive but we're going to  starve to death so what the so what the good is this how sick are we in today's paper they said  there's a forty percent rise of rice who the eats that anyway i don't give a 
[03:10:00]  there's a hundred percent raise i don't eat that as long as i don't with my pasta and my  tomatoes because that's the national flower of italy the tomato you take tomatoes away from us we  fucking close the country down i'm telling you that because you know what tomatoes have that  that thing called testosterone testosterone yeah yeah that's in a tomato no that's what's keeping  you fucking alive because tomato is absolutely a fruit it's not a fucking vegetable we know that  but the italians you know something we hit us one fucking day we saw it's still in the vegetable 
[03:10:30]  section though in the supermarket it always is because we're not that fucking brat you put it  in the apple section they won't buy it they can't come in and actually put it in the fruits uh  section no no everyone knows it pat there's no way you're 79 with all this energy well it's uh  when i leave here i lay down and i'll get up i'll get up saturday afternoon i don't know what it is  i really don't i'm gonna attempt to have like uh an actual conversation with pat cooper now instead  of like all righty like it hurts me let me tell you something it hurts me because i've tried to talk 
[03:11:00]  you know very nice that distinguish and people say you all right yeah what's the matter with you it's  the truth yeah you bring up a really good point though because when my dad was getting older  we were still trying to get him to like exercise and eat right and finally we realized the the guy  lived his life and he still wants to eat his chicken wings leave him alone leave him alone  when you hit 70 it's not time to make you know uh changes in your life you know my philosophy is you  see these kids who have who have bad diseases 8 19 years old that's my favorite charity those kids may 
[03:11:30]  never have a chance to be 50 or 60 years old so when a guy's 50 or six you want to put him into  training why he wants to look good for his wife or for some bro that's right and stupid right do the  best i don't say come to be 300 pounds but by jesus christ i used to be 137 when i stopped smoking i ran  up to 190 and i used to eat those cigarettes but i stopped smoking you know now i turn around and uh  i'm about 190 i got a little bit of a belly i love it look in the mirror i go god bless you good 
[03:12:00]  looking mother jumper you're fucking good i look in there i look at my penis it's just hanging there  like this here and i go what a fucking life ahead see that's what it comes down and i think younger  people don't understand that when you get to like pat cooper's age you've lived your life and you don't  want you don't want younger uh family members or people telling you you need to eat better you  need to exercise you need to sleep uh go to bed at a decent hour you've you've done it man you just  want to live the remaining years like i didn't expect to get this far people says my god you got 
[03:12:30]  you know with my attitude that my wife she said i don't know how you don't get killed because i say  some things that people want to break in i said they're gonna hit me i'll fucking own them what  am i gonna do when the one you hit me for if you beat me with your brains i respect if you raise your  hands to me i'm gonna fucking own you because that's that i don't go for that i don't fear and sometimes  you should fear but i don't fear i know my limitations and if it gets into that i back away  and say hey right hey i'm right but that's okay let's forget and i'll take a powder because who the

[03:16:30]  what buddy tom if you're listening quit  made a lot of our fans very happy with that line april 26th which is saturday count basie  theater red bank new jersey you're sticking around i'm just trying to get some plugs in for you here  uh north fork theater out there on long island and uh westbury may 9th uh pat cooper and then you're  doing a pal talk show on may 14th at 8 a.m yeah you're gonna be my guest we're we're trying but  we do our show at that time listen at night time it says 8 a.m i thought that was listen to me you  got a headache do me a fucking favor it's night i'm just waiting what i got you can't do it just 
[03:17:00]  say you can't do it i would love to do the pat cooper you gotta do it otherwise i'll make a phone  call may 14th at 8 p.m and speaking of comedians before we take a break um and continue with the great  pat cooper 79 it's amazing to be honest with you thank you uh hector v from georgia writes uh  op you got to tell norton that jimmy schubert was on ron and fez yesterday and he used the phrase  put his meat shank in her prison pocket you like schubert jimmy we like schubert we really do we 
[03:17:30]  we liked him so much we had him part of our comedy tour which we would love to talk to you about i think  we're doing a few dates let me ask you a question my only problem today is and you know i i don't know  most of the comics around the younger guys it's not that i don't like him he's been around he used  to be part of uh sam kinnison's uh posse back in the day yeah i understand that but i'm just  gotta be mid-40s at this point i knew i know but when you first came around i you know i said  because we're doing what's his name tough crowd college yeah so and then i got to know him i know  about you and but a lot of these guys they were saying to me you don't know him you know what i'm 
[03:18:00]  saying jesus don't you like him as i never saw them work because i don't go nowhere right right  i don't go anywhere right now i'm gonna go you know but the new breed of comic is  it's completely different than what i do what you were doing sure you know but and they're  wonderful but jimmy schubert we we love the guy and we really do but we make fun of the fact that  he comes up with these what do you call these great euphemisms uh you know like i get what he's  saying i understand yeah yeah but he does something like that dom arreira tom does it dom arreira does  about uh 15 minutes of these kind of remarks you want to get him to do that isn't it's it's hilarious 
[03:18:30]  is great yeah yeah i've seen him do that but schubert has a million of them and we make fun of  the fact that he uh might uh do it a little too much i can't remember some of them i just remember  that like instead of coming he would go then you know you're gonna put you put your meat stick in  a meat pocket and then you get potato flakes oh potato flakes but what the i can't remember  anything you would do that's funny that's very funny that's funny spew out your baby batter let it dry  in the back wipe off the potato flakes what what the uh uh pat tammy pascinelli or past she's

[03:39:30]  person he might be here when we get back if not it was great pat god bless you pat cooper the great  pat cooper uh we'll do all right shut up for this shit okay ladies and gentlemen we're about to take  a break now at opie and anthony and jim norton that's our comic he's gonna keep you smiling  and we want you to be right there when we come back so don't touch that down we'll be right back 
[03:40:00]  oh man i need a nap you have to love wow man he's just  fucking he's pat is just a purely funny dude you know what 79 i don't think really is that old  i really don't but to have an energy like that at 79 i think it's pretty fucking rare amazing  really that's that's 79 just going the whole time yep non-stop yep non-stop that guy unbelievable hey uh  that's been making us laugh all morning long hopefully we can get this up on a website  it's a it's a cartoon of batman reading a note from who um dr leet dr leet spelled in leet speak 
[03:40:30]  which is l33t yep yep and what does the note say that batman's reading um it's just a picture and  i think originally batman was upset about something and crying but somebody might have done a little  photoshop and he's reading a note that says dear batman i came in your mask regards dr leet it looks  like jizz yeah that's a funny one that's one of those uh you're the man now dog pages yeah uh bad 
[03:41:00]  news the number four batman steven s from bay show writes uh if anthony went in for steam the whole sauna  would smell like roasting kielbasa yeah would you just stop if it was if it was a chill he'd win but  steam would expand that fucking i what do we call it a fucking just a just a crowned gift  that fucking that that ridged gift i i gotta tell you what happens like during some of these breaks 
[03:41:30]  it happens maybe twice a week uh we're like an eclipse yeah we all have to take a leak at the same  time and and jimmy and i marched to the stalls and and we talk about like this this uh particular  instance uh we talked about the pat cooper you know you go to the urinals at the urinals i mean  i'm sorry urinals and you know jimmy and i even will back up just maybe slightly too much just that's  not even see that's what i i'm not uh we lean we lean over a little bit just to kind of make sure  the other guy's hearing yeah we got the we got the urinal in between us the buffer yeah the buffer do 
[03:42:00]  yeah yes we do but then i'm with the hole in it now no but then anthony uh we don't even know  half the time he's in there but we realize there's a a a stall door closed and we're like oh that's  anthony taking a leak i like uh taking a leak in a toilet anthony refuses to take a leak with the boys  at the urinals if there's a toilet a bowl available to leak and i will leak in that and you sit down  right uh no i don't sit okay girls girls sit because anthony's growing up right but anthony's cock being 
[03:42:30]  like the big size anthony didn't realize can i set this up by the way jimmy because i didn't know  where you're going and it'll you know it's a we're on the same page so because anthony is obviously  embarrassed by his massive manhood and can't be uh standing next to the boys in the urinals jimmy and  i will discuss what we think is going on in anthony's mind and this is what was discussed in the bathroom  it's just the fact that the problem is he's so embarrassed by his big cock because like as a kid  they would always the teachers would always like take him to the principal thinking he was an older 
[03:43:00]  boy like because they're in the locker room he'd be like they're all in like sixth grade and they  would come and they'd say uh son didn't you graduate two years ago he'd say no i'm just the boy like  they are but he had the cock of a man this massive cock and then we're imagining what he's doing in  the stall like i bet you he doesn't even touch it i bet you he doesn't even look down at it i bet  you he's scared of its of its shadow what the fuck is wrong with you people they thought you were  retarded because you had a dummy dingle what retards always have big dicks so the other kids would 
[03:43:30]  call you dummy dingle yeah every every day they would line them up on the short bus line because  they they said with a cock like that he has to be slow the first time anthony realized that he was  fucking blessed between those fucking little italian legs he thought it was a curse and then a priest  or an older man maybe a coach patted his crotch and said no no no it's a gift  and he went really and he said yes really mr i like how you say mr really mr mr yeah so we just 
[03:44:00]  imagine as we're taking our leaks i'm glad you fantasize he just gets mortified in that stall yes  i do you can feel how red he's getting and he doesn't dare look down at it because he just doesn't  know how to handle it still now that he's an adult male he still doesn't know what to do with it and  he's just like oh all this goodness and not enough time yeah i just said that's all look see you know 
[03:44:30]  if you're at the urinals with us then it would just be a casual little conversation about pat cooper  no it wouldn't it's fucking jimmy at the the urinal and and i don't trust jimmy he's the same guy that  just followed me into the stall i always i walk in and he follows in like three inches behind me  he tries to close the door he'll walk in and i turn around to close the door and jimmy's standing  there get the fuck out one of one of these days you'll give in they all do  they all do jimmy got me at least a year and a half ago at this point 
[03:45:00]  jesus give in like giving in the best and jimmy hasn't done in a while thank god and i think if  if he does it again we'll probably officially be kicked out of this building  is uh when jimmy goes into the stall next to you and he kind of gets your attention because you're  talking and you and you you kind of turn your head to the side even though there's no nothing to  look at or anything you're in separate stalls the next thing you realize that jimmy is pretty much  pissing under the stall yeah yeah he's pissing and i think that's why you turn your head because 
[03:45:30]  all of a sudden you kind of hear something you're like that can't possibly be pissed you just  see a stream going kind of behind your toilet right hitting my stall  he's a mess god bless you jimmy jimmy's uh off to chicago yeah i guess we'll wrap up with line of the  day we had a few other things but we'll wait for tomorrow because um there's a guy there's  a guy ripping off aj poopy shits on yes break.com and he's doing it very badly actually yeah well i 
[03:46:00]  actually think he was doing it better than aj poopy shits do you want to do this really quick  before we get out of here do line of the day well if there's time but i think we should look at  anthony goes well as if there's time as he looks to see if we made it to 11 and i'm looking going  wrap that up in three minutes you got a flight jimmy yeah that's right you guys do it i can just go  i don't want to the worst ringer ever  uh yeah oh wow wow wow wow the great ronnie b yeah i feel privileged

[03:48:00]  line of the day this is right out of a harry potter novel the congo uh is stupid and then  sometimes the two males will fight for dominance and the right to mate with the female  but if yours has been stolen then you're kind of uh out of luck you certainly are i think uh niggle out  of luck oh thank you six flags more sex more fun oh thank you yes i did all right with the funnel 
[03:48:30]  meter yeah still trying to figure out what to do with the funnel meter but uh we'll get there  ashleymadison.com uh here's another runner-up line of the day that's right they're using their  worship tree to give us tiny genitals all right we'll get into this next they go you're asian  ta-da glad the xmers heard that because the yeah the other regular radio people didn't  it's too offensive wait they dumped that today of course they did where where's the dump sheet 
[03:49:00]  because talking about you know i'm not surprised but no making a stereotype joke about asian penises  will um terrible obviously be uh the end of the world it's fucking yeah but the six flags campaign is  okay six flags more sex nation nation of fucking unbelievable where's john lou pussies take take  that one on john lou and leave us uh alone we're just trying to entertain uh one more runner-up one  more runner-up why would why would randy need a bodyguard who the fuck's gonna fight with this guy these 
[03:49:30]  guys were pay attention what about your partner he doesn't even breathe anymore  oh he smashed you there was there was a moment there when they first came in when the show first  started that i got a a little post-it note from than he comes in and i read it and it says uh your  brother called said your alarm's going off at your house uh call him so now i'm sitting here on the  show and then i had to start texting and you're you're gonna answer you're thinking my dream came true i 
[03:50:00]  finally have a home invader and i'm not there i'm not there to kill him to shoot for the love of god  everything's all right now oh yeah yeah see i'm glad you cleared that up because um i and i believe  jimmy as well because we're doing this bit together i believe you were daydreaming about your delicious  cock no i wasn't daydreaming about i don't sit there and daydream about my uh genitals just kind of  try to think of like uh a daydream about them going in places well jimmy's ass mouth 
[03:50:30]  well you're only human anthony anthony's dick is so thick that the head actually has two little arms  with hands that come out and actually will open the asshole for it like the way you'd  fucking the way you would open something now jimmy that would scare i'll let you get away with that  horrid joke i because i believe that would scare away women uh hands little hands on a penis that's 
[03:51:00]  that's true you think when a hard joke part so suck that dick not a big one like yours either  big one with arms jimmy no but a little asian one you think when anthony has sex um might as well go  down this road a little longer like boy like the girl is not allowed to look in his eyes because like  he's embarrassed of of how massive it is and he's kind of ashamed here's what anthony does he puts his face in  her neck okay and he just holds under the back and he just pumps stupidly stupidly he's he's he 
[03:51:30]  fucking pumps stupidly there's no finesse and this is the noise they make  it's like you can't tell if she's being fucked or shot with a cannonball you think  you think he just shouts out i'm ashamed mama  oh no i don't think he does i think all you hear is the wet slap of his fucking awful pubes  against whatever victim he's polarizing  first of all isn't true at all secondly doesn't sound very complimentary uh jimmy face right in a 
[03:52:00]  girl's neck just fucking just like the way an animal would there's no there's no talking i'll give you  that oh i do kind of have a you got to give that personal animalistic um you gotta give a little  personal touch there yeah no i do i'm so glad we brought up your big cock it's been way too long  oh yeah it's uh yeah it's great it's just such a comfortable fucking break for me obviously you  haven't been to the congo oh where the where the sorcerers shrink your penis jesus maybe you could go 
[03:52:30]  there for some oh god maybe you could go to the actually the line might have been better if it was  maybe you should go to the congo for some and get a normal sized dick or something or yeah yeah  i think where are we at there danny ladies would find me quite average yeah i don't uh you know why  put the word out there it's massive what the what so you they can only be disappointed if it isn't dude 
[03:53:00]  that's that's that's why they invented liquor they don't liquor they don't they won't know  roofies are for that's why you gotta date them fucking really really young oh my goodness  look man i was there the famous day when i heard a bunch of girls saying wow and that's that's where  this whole thing started well it was a perfect it was a perfect storm all i heard was wow oh my great  it's just a perfect storm the reason i said great is because they were heading toward me next 
[03:53:30]  by the way i would have showed that day if i had something don't make excuses you didn't  the girls yelled at you you were chased away by girls because you didn't want to show your wee  wee so the girls laughed and chased you away yeah but that then they they they went right back to you  and then i do remember that there may have been a session of show and tell with a slob oh yeah i was 
[03:54:00]  getting married well yeah she was the bachelorette i think and um well that was the whole deal i was  going to show mine if she showed her but then the other her friend had a show too and her friend  was remember they had one hot friend yeah that was the one that had a show the rest of them were pigs  and and the one that was getting married was probably the piggiest of all and when she lifted she  lifted something up that made her bunt fall her bunt fell out oh my i was just like all right  thanks and i ran to the van where her friend was and i go okay your turn right and she goes show me 
[03:54:30]  okay and then and then and then she she just took and she held it in the palm of her hand  and she just goes oh this is a nice one and kind of moved her hand a little up and down as to to  weigh like like to weigh it a little like when you put something in your hand and you want to feel how  much it weighs you kind of go yeah let me yeah that's what she did she kind of did that right  i'm like oh you know it wasn't even a sexual thing it was just kind of let me check out how 
[03:55:00]  many doubloons would uh maybe would uh tip the scales with this thing indiana jones yeah yeah  thank you there you go she was like she was ready to put the sack of sand uh to replace the golden idol  head how how much do you uh these are ongoing stories obviously new for some people guys i got  i gotta head out how much whatever jimmy see how much uh  i know you got a pack i'll see you uh monday morning all right jimmy safe trip jimmy pittsburgh 
[03:55:30]  next week yeah may 2nd may 2nd pittsburgh the great jim norton he's uh flying out to chicago  uh how much do you regret um not skinny dipping with the bud the bud it was the uh kalua girls oh  kalua girls the kalua girls actually that same joint had uh bud girls that's why i was girls too  yeah oh please how much do you regret that you and i didn't go skinny dipping with  i don't even think they were 20 i was married at the time i hope he was in a serious relationship 
[03:56:00]  so we and just like stopped short and um this is what sucks about us we like god we're like i don't  know we're we're we're we're faithful to a fault we were both in not good relationships no we still  fucking went home instead of skinny dipping with 19 or 20 year olds i did get drunk and started making  out with the girl with the braces oh yeah me well obviously your relationship was a little worse than 
[03:56:30]  yeah i was really teetering at that point believe me believe me it was a teetering but then yeah  they were like oh let's go skinny dipping oh no no no no no can't do that oh we gotta go home  i just the waste of some prime tail  yeah thanks man ah fucking broads prime tail yeah where the fuck am i by the way steve um you do 
[03:57:00]  know that uh we're probably nagely expression that was yeah we're probably get the heat off me anthony  and i are probably two months out from our 10-year anniversary being on new york radio so i'm sure the  big 10-year anniversary show is coming right whoa wow of course yes the panic that went across 
[03:57:30]  steve's face 10 year anniversary show 10 how about a step and have it happened i was just contemplating  my own 10 years with you guys so of course i had that's the reason i brought it up because  steve was beyond a cool guy yesterday too uh called uh and uh steve's like man 10 years of this  bullshit or whatever and i'm like holy shit it's been 10 years yeah it's like a  fucking manslaughter rap we got we got fired from boston 10 years ago this past april we had to take  about two months off two and a half and then we started up in new york and then had to take a couple 
[03:58:00]  years off in there but yeah yeah it's true it's so funny when people ask us how long have you guys  been doing radio together i'm like well in uh in what year actual years because and i we started  about 14 years ago yeah but we've only done 11 about 11 years yeah trucking uh i just sometimes i  think about all the great radio we could have probably done in those two years off oh would 
[03:58:30]  have been fantastic all right we're babbling what could have been astrobadison.com ronafez  noon to three here is your line of the day here comes the line of the day  the police chief is saying i'm tempted tempted so that means there's a there's a there's a doubt in 
[03:59:00]  his mind i would say it was a joke let me go cut this chicken's throat first and see what he says  six flags more fun more fun i think more fun after that no well six legs same thing yeah yeah i  think you could just assume it's more fun when it's six flags all right what the hell um yeah  how many more runners up no that was it i figured i would just allow the listeners to see what 
[03:59:30]  actually happens when our brains are completely empty from doing radio all right yeah yeah this is  what you get  yeah like a quarter two or 20 to 11 we hear that ding the low fuel alert comes on on our brains and you know  you know you only have a certain amount of miles left now we're just coasting into the gas station 
[04:00:00]  going yeah yeah this wouldn't empty here's a yeah a dry tank as far as the radio personalities sounds like  yeah yeah yeah oh god yeah  what i have copy fuck a duck seriously shit in a hat for who what is it for 
[04:00:30]  is it is it an easy one or a hard one because i don't like hard ones oh my god again you know i  love to find people at gamefly yes uh you get games and uh it's great it's a great service but i got to  tell you i read a lot of copy for gamefly when are you gonna learn from me what i've been teaching  this for 14 years i know fuck it up do shitty production they never come to you again and 
[04:01:00]  they'll never ask you to do it 14 years later you you have to stay late to do production and  i know it's the same gag as fucking aaf what happened is to be there till 10 at night sometimes  these motherfuckers at aaf will tell this last story and it's it's been told so the faithful go to go  to fucking ethel there's nothing gonna happen after this uh or squiz squiz is actually rocking  these days um fucking at aaf they paid us shit and we were like you know i mean 
[04:01:30]  we hate talking like this but the reality is we were the stars of the station yeah we put it on the  map really making no money getting huge ratings and it wasn't good enough that we were getting  unbelievable ratings and afternoon drive they forced us to do saturdays even though the morning guy  uh the hill man you know the man show crap or the man town crap yeah he didn't have to do weekends  because he was quote the star of the the station even though like we were doing way better than him 
[04:02:00]  and then we had to do production after we got off the air at uh seven seven thirty at night  and it was a ton of production because they were they're one of these radio stations where all the  jocks have to do production they want the voices on the air and man our stacks of production started at the  same level day one here's anthony stack and here's hope he's yeah we'd have to read do reads recorder  myself on tape and anthony came up with the uh one of my many uh many nicknames he he started calling 
[04:02:30]  me slappy slappy because i would slap this shit together i didn't have i didn't have a radio voice so  that you know why bother i would just make horrible edits like the music would be too loud as i'm trying  to talk about the oh it was terrible he was able to record a 60-minute commercial in real time  it was just like it was a 60 second it would take 60 seconds right for him to slap the commercial  together i remember what my favorite was uh sir morgan's cove they they bragged 20 years later 
[04:03:00]  that the rolling stones played there once yeah like there was some weird fluke that happened like  the stars aligned in such a way that the rolling stones played a bus broke down in front of the place  on the way to boston it was like some kind of scooby-doo thing happened yeah yeah and uh the  rolling stones played sir morgan's cove once and 20 years later they're still bragging that this is  the club the rolling stones played at that's great so every copy would have rolling stones music even  though it was like the shit band of the day playing there so i would just i would just start like uh 
[04:03:30]  start me up or you can't get no satisfaction the vocals are cranking and i'm just trying to talk over  like mix vocals yeah because a little secret here when you're doing production um uh you're supposed  to pick uh music just the musical part of a song and you talk over that yeah and um opie would would  start with maybe a little bit of music and then the words would kick in and opie's just talking louder 
[04:04:00]  over the words and you can't understand the phone number i'm trying to compete with i'm trying to  compete with mick jagger mick you're fucking yelling over mick for some dumb rock club in  worcester massachusetts oh it's horrible josh s uh for philly thank you i do read uh everyone's uh  instant feedback um so anyway to finish the story so then next thing i know our production piles at  seven o'clock started going like this ants would get higher and mine would get lower  and then it got to a point where i would have to do what's called tags yeah which would be stuff 
[04:04:30]  like uh wednesday on tbs yeah that was literally that's all over the door wednesday 8 p.m tbs  and that was it and i'm sitting there running like 16 tracks of sound over dubbing trying to get  like different sound effects to make it sound like a motorcycle for a motorcycle using commercial  using all your voices voices sound effects i'm rattling fucking tambourines with my foot 
[04:05:00]  it was like a fucking production going on and i would be close like and i'm done how long you  gonna be because we used to hang out a lot back then he's like dude i got at least another hour hour  and a half i'm like all right i'll take it easy i'm like i'll see you at that mexican that mexican  joint at route nine yeah i'll see you there about nine o'clock i'm like huh it's weird they only gave  me a couple tags today wednesday 8 p.m tbs it even got to the point wait a minute it even got to 
[04:05:30]  the point where you didn't even have to talk there was one thing where they gave him a reel of tape  with the entire commercial on it and all you had to do is play it and put it on a cart  you were transferring you were dubbing one tape to another they wouldn't even let you talk  and i'm sitting in there fucking sliders with my foot i'm trying to wear sliders with my feet  trying to get these spots fucking to sound good but it all fair as i had a few years under my belt so  you certainly paid your dues so i kind of learned some some tricks of the trades i was i was paying 
[04:06:00]  my dude and it did pay off because i did win uh an award for one of my commercials that i put together  up there for a head fucking which homeless guy has that award yeah i know yeah uh just maybe a tease  you're not the only award winner for their production work around here really yes our very  own travis travis award uh one award for his psa what award have you won you maybe for another day
