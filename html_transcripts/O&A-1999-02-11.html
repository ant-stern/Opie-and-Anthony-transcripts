<pre> Live, we definitely suggest you get there early.  The weather's going to be absolutely great.  It's going to feel like spring out tomorrow again.  Everyone's going to be in a festive mood to party.  So you know, blow off work.  Blow off the afternoon and come on out.  We've got a lot of fun things going on here.  Steven Lynch is going to be playing live.  All of your favorites.  Yep.  And my brother Joe is going to be playing live doing some of the parodies you've heard  here on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  And we have Tara.  We're going to be crowning Tara, the hottest girl to ever pose naked for the Opie and Anthony  show. 
[00:30]
 We're going to officially crown her tomorrow.  Right.  Even though there's a competition going on as we speak.  Yes.  As we speak on the web.  If you weren't listening yesterday, Spike came in, the first challenger to Tara, and  she, you know, she got her photos taken and her pictures are up right now.  And we're encouraging you guys to really take your time with both sets of photos.  Spend some time with them.  Spend some time with them because the vote is going to be in your hands, guys and girls.  You have to decide who is the hottest hottest girl. 
[01:00]
 Yeah.  Tara or Spike.  So far, so far.  Right.  Because this is an ongoing thing.  Yes.  Whoever wins this is the king of the hill until the next person comes along.  The next girl comes in and dethrones them.  That's right.  But right now, Tara is the hottest girl to ever pose naked.  Right.  We'll crown her tomorrow.  And then we're going to tally the votes from the Tara Spike competition that's going on  as we speak.  And Tuesday, Tuesday, we'll announce the winner of that competition.  Right.  Because we want you guys to have the whole weekend to try to decide. 
[01:30]
 Spend some time with these ladies.  Yeah.  Take it seriously.  You know, really pick them apart and stuff and really make your decision.  A lot of people are saying it's apples and oranges, though.  I'll be true.  How can you compare these two girls?  Tara is the wholesome girl next door type.  Whereas Spike is that the wicked girl.  So you're a dirty girl, aren't you?  With the latex and whips and jeans.  Well, I read about 500 emails before it went on the air.  We're reading every single email. 
[02:00]
 By the way, it's impossible at this point for us to write you back, unfortunately.  And we really like writing everyone back.  But we're getting about a thousand emails a day at this point.  Yeah.  So we have pretty much given up on sending emails back to you guys.  So keep them coming.  We do a read them.  Yeah, we read every single one.  One guy said Tara is the type of girl you bring home, you know, to meet your mom.  Right.  And Spike is the type of girl you just bring home.  And then the other trend I'm noticing, a lot of people are saying, but Tara's head 
[02:30]
 on Spike's body.  Really?  And a bunch of the guys have put the photos in their Photoshop and they're already sent  pictures of what that would look like.  It's pretty funny.  We might have to post a couple of those on the website eventually as well.  Creative little boogers.  But there you go.  You guys definitely got to take your time with both sets of photographs.  Hi, any double to you?  Hello.  What's up?  That chick is nasty.  Spike is scary, man.  You don't like that?  It's disgusting.  What's up with that? 
[03:00]
 Oh, she's close.  Well, I don't know about that.  Look at her face, man.  She's got like that funky eyebrow.  She had the Marilyn Manson makeup on.  She's got a lot of the makeup on.  Not on the track inside.  That is totally disgusting.  Some guys are into that, though.  They like that whole look.  No, sorry.  That is total fuj.  So I guess you're in the Tara camp.  Yeah, definitely.  Well, there's a lot of people in the Spike camp, I must say.  Yeah.  It could go either way.  It's so wild that the girls are in the Spikes camp.  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I think the guys that are in the Spike camp can beat the crap out of the guys that are  in the Tara camp.  Let me just say that.  I'm sure.  All right.  Later on, guys.  Thanks.  So that's something you can participate in today.  We like a lot of audience participation on our show, if you haven't figured that out by 
[03:30]
 now.  Also, because we are going to be doing a lot of live shows, we're going to be doing a lot  of live shows.  We're going to be doing a lot of live shows.  We're going to be doing a lot of live shows.  We're going to be doing a lot of live shows.  We're going to be doing a lot of live shows.  We're going to be doing a lot of live shows.  We're going to be doing a lot of live shows.  We're going to the Longshore Brewery tomorrow to do our show live from 3 to 7 in Garden  City.  We're not going to be in the studio for FU Friday.  So we're encouraging you guys to send in your FUs today through the fax line so we can bring 
[04:00]
 the whole pile of faxes down to the Longshore Brewery and read them on the air.  So you can do that ahead of time as well.  The fax line, 212-957-WNEW.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Kenny Wayne Shepard and Blue on Black.  It's Opie and Anthony hanging with you.  And we got Spike on the line.  Spike, she heard us talking about her.  Spike!  What's up?  Spike, what's up?  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[04:30]
 You know, I take compliments and constructive criticism fairly well, I think.  But none of those pictures show my face.  Well, what do you mean?  Well, none of them show my face really.  And the only ones that do are really, really fuzzy.  So I sent you guys a nice picture in email.  You did?  Yes, yes, I did.  But you can check.  And if you feel the urge, you can post it up there with the rest of them.  We could do that for you.  You got the...  I think Anthony was distracted by your memories.  Yeah, I know.  He was taking pictures of the rest of this stuff. 
[05:00]
 Are you saying maybe I was taking pictures of other places?  Yes, I was saying you neglected the face, which is not a bad thing because let me tell  you something, I agree, power of faith beats out mine.  But let me tell you something, as a whole, total package, I'm going to have to say.  That was...  I'm not going to start criticizing on the air because I don't like it.  Oh, wow.  You have a few problems with that?  Go ahead, go ahead.  No, you see, I can't...  You could criticize because they can't...  You guys have built her up to be like this beautiful rock star, beautiful woman. 
[05:30]
 She's like the most perfect, wonderful thing.  How can I compete with that?  Yeah, no, we just said she was the hottest girl so far to take her clothes off on our  show.  You should have seen what's been in here.  Yeah, you have some...  Oh my God.  She's got the title so far.  We should get you and Tara on the phone to discuss each other's bodies.  Wait, I'm looking at the pictures here.  The picture of you bending over before you disrobed, that's a great face shot right there.  It's all right, but you really can't see it because it's really small.  Then the other picture... 
[06:00]
 You know, when I pulled it up, it didn't come out too good.  Well, I have to compress these things.  All right, then...  There's no compressing my body, honey.  You're...  No, that's for sure.  And then the you're a dirty girl picture.  That looks good.  Hello, boys.  That one had a decent face shot, except that it was so fuzzy that you really couldn't see it.  What kind of computer are you using?  No, I got a decent computer.  I don't know why it wouldn't work.  Wait, Spike, I got to put you on the line with somebody.  All righty.  Who's this?  Tara. 
[06:30]
 Tara.  Yeah?  Oh, Tara's on the line.  Spike.  What's up?  Oh, we got both girls on the line.  The two competitors.  Why?  It's such a good thing that women are more civilized than men.  Hello.  Hi.  Hello.  Hi.  How are you?  It's a beautiful thing that us women are more civilized than men.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I just want to say something.  You are.  You got a gorgeous figure.  You do.  You got a nice rack.  Thank you very much.  I absolutely agree.  Let me tell you, there was a girl in high school that I had the biggest crush on.  She looked exactly like you. 
[07:00]
 Oh, thank you.  You just had the most beautiful face and the greatest hair I had ever seen in my entire  life.  I was like, oh.  And finally, we were in union.  Everything, you know, like I said, I worked last night and I put, when I got home, I looked  at the pictures.  You know, I don't think the pictures do either of us any justice.  No.  One, they're nasty.  And two, I do have a better figure.  You know what I mean?  It's true.  I agree that if I saw you in person, you probably would have a hell of a lot better than those  pictures.  Yeah. 
[07:30]
 Well, you know, it's just that, you know, I'm like I said, I mean, this is like a competition  I didn't expect.  You know, this is just me.  You decided to go and get naked.  Yeah.  I don't want to compete with anybody.  And now it's just like a full blown thing, which is cool.  You know, I mean, it's actually been kind of fun.  You know, the constructive criticism I try and handle.  I don't know if I'm doing as well as you, but you are beautiful and I hope that you're  there tomorrow.  You know, I think that would be cool.  I would very much look forward to meeting you and I look forward to seeing you in person  rather than those pictures because if they did as good for you as they did for me, I'll 
[08:00]
 be very happy to see you.  I just, you know, like it's like I went in there.  I was out all day, you know, I didn't go in there for Paris.  If I had gone in there for Paris, I'm sure I would have done a lot better.  Yeah, fair enough.  You know, you're ready and you're like, you know, and I actually tried to prepare, but  I was like in a rush to be there.  But on the air with this, that's why they're laughing, aren't they?  I know.  They're like, that's okay.  Keep talking girls.  I'm not done yet.  I probably hear this all the time when they go home with their girlfriend or their wife.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on. 
[08:30]
 Wait, girls, we had to jump out of here.  No cursing, please.  I know.  I skipped on that one.  I think we got it.  You guys are, you guys are taking this way too hard.  You guys, I wish I could email you the thousand emails that we're getting on both of you guys.  People love both of you.  No, I'm glad that everybody does.  You know what I'm saying?  But it's, believe me, like I went up there for me and now like I got, I got probably  the whole tri-state area telling me what's wrong with me.  No, no, no, no, no, that's not true.  More people are saying how gorgeous you are than what's wrong with you. 
[09:00]
 Exactly.  They're all saying what's right with you.  I mean, it's so easy to focus on like the negative because it just makes for fun radio.  But the fact is that both of you guys are getting so many more positive emails than negative.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Positive emails from girls.  You know, that's kind of boring.  It's just, it's more fun to just talk about.  Oh, of course.  I mean, it's always cool to mock.  Yeah, yeah.  Spike.  There's got to be some mocking.  And I expected that.  Like I said, what did I say?  The whole matter was in there.  There's going to be some. 
[09:30]
 I know there is.  Hey, Spike.  Yeah.  If I may speak to Spike for a moment.  Spike, yeah, a lot of chicks coming out for you.  Saying that you're really hot and they'd like you to whip their asses.  All right.  Well, you let them send you some pictures and you tell me which one you like the best.  Yeah, you do the scanning.  Yeah, Spike sent the chicks.  I'm there, dude.  That is so cool.  Well, I know what we're going to have to do now when we do this in the future, Opie.  We are going to have to get a professional photographer down here to take these pictures.  You know, I would think that somebody would have called. 
[10:00]
 What do you mean?  Again, offer, you know?  No, they're calling.  They're calling like crazy, but you know, we want to take the pictures.  Oh, come on.  Well, you can be there, but you got to be there.  We'll take a couple.  If we're going to continue this concept, we'll take a few photography lessons.  How's that?  Oh, you want to?  There we go.  You got to go Polaroid.  The digital camera's not doing it, man.  Not doing it.  Oh, but it's so fast and easy.  But you know what?  What's cool about it, though, is tomorrow when I get there, you know, I can just show them.  There'll be no, you know, you'll look at the pictures. 
[10:30]
 Right, there's no question about it.  There's no doubt about it.  You know, and I mean, it actually boosted my confidence in a lot.  I work around, I work in scores and there are billions of beautiful women in that club.  It's done a lot for my, my, my self-esteem and my confidence.  Well, we would love to get both of yous together up on stage tomorrow.  Okay.  And I'm sure, I will tell you, the guys will love you both.  Yes.  And, and we're encouraging everyone to vote and we are going to crown the winner of this 
[11:00]
 competition Tuesday afternoon.  So everyone has a whole weekend to really look over the pictures and really decide for themselves.  Okay.  Right now, the voting is really interesting.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I don't want to give any hints which way it's going.  Well, you're so different, the two of yous.  It's amazing.  It's funny because like, I think looks are deceiving on my end.  I'll take that as a good thing.  Yeah, it is a good thing.  Let me take you out to dinner.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[11:30]
 It's love connection.  I'm sure somebody like Tara has a boyfriend already, okay?  Yes, I do.  I'm sure he would love to have one.  I'm sure he would.  And Spike, I'm also counting how many guys want to be whipped by you, by the way.  Yeah.  It's over a hundred.  I sent you guys my mistress intensive email address and you can put that on the website  if you feel the urge and I'll get some customers that way.  Cool.  We'll do that for you.  If you want to do a little percentage thing, I'll make you guys my little manager if you  get a cut.  We could figure something out. 
[12:00]
 No.  That's called pimping.  Pimp it ain't easy.  That depends on what I'm doing, but okay.  All right, guys.  Well, thanks for both of you checking in, Tara and Spike.  Okay.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  Nice to see you, Rick.  Yeah, hold on.  We'll put you both on hold then.  Tara, you're definitely going to be there.  Spike, you're going to be there tomorrow?  Yes, I will.  All right.  So both girls will be at the Longshore Brewery when we broadcast live tomorrow from three  to seven.  Great.  All right.  Hold on, girls.  I think I got them both on hold.  There you go.  That was a little treat, huh? 
[12:30]
 Yeah.  That was nice.  Rick, you got to give Spike my personal email address for those pictures.  Okay.  1027WNOW, the Rock of New York with The Clash and London Calling.  We are starting to play a lot more Clash on the radio these days.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  Sophie and Anthony.  Hello.  And we are still trying to clean up the mess we got ourselves into yesterday on the show.  We're finding out more and more about yesterday's show as we continue here. 
[13:00]
 Well, and explain what we did to Black Earl yesterday.  We didn't do anything.  We had Spike, lovely dominatrix, come in and she had a whip, chains, handcuffs.  And somehow Earl got dragged in here, handcuffed to a mic stand and whipped by Spike.  I don't know.  I thought it was a little odd that an African man as Earl is would be chained and whipped 
[13:30]
 in a studio.  Not that PC, I guess.  Well, the interesting thing is Earl locked himself in that studio behind you, Anthony.  Yes.  He was in the dark and he didn't want any part of the whipping.  No.  Well, can you blame the man?  And then one...  And then someone who works at N.E.W. found the master key to the studio and they unlocked  the door and then Earl was dragged into the studio. 
[14:00]
 We cannot deny that part of it.  And then Rick decides to handcuff him to the mic stand.  Rick did that?  Yeah, Rick did that.  I thought Spike did that.  And then Spike, you know, pushed his head down so, you know, he's up against the counter  and then he got a whipping.  Oh, I also found the key.  All right.  So you freed him to your regular Abe Lincoln.  Now we got black Earl in the studio and if you look at the pictures on the website, it 
[14:30]
 really looks like I know it sounded pretty brutal to listen to on the radio yesterday,  but if you look at the pictures, it's obvious that Earl was enjoying himself yesterday.  Oh, yeah, sure.  He was.  Well, maybe you can ask Earl.  Earl, were you enjoying yourself yesterday?  To a degree.  Yes.  Well, to a degree, no.  Well, we've just been informed by our spies that work here at N.E.W., our go-between between 
[15:00]
 us and management that a couple of black activist groups have called on your behalf.  Go home.  Don't go away.  Please.  It was it was it's just radio guys.  Go home.  Oh, boy.  They are coming out of the woodwork to defend you, Earl.  And as we all know, Johnny Cochran is in town.  So I guess he's too high.  I guess it's the fringe people, though.  They they were a little too late to hop on the cause that is going on this week. 
[15:30]
 So they're here to help Earl, I guess.  I would I would kill to get a copy of those phone calls coming into management from the  black activist groups about black Earl.  Well, and Anthony's defense.  What's this I hear about black girl being whipped?  We have spent two hundred years fighting this type of oppression only to have a man named  Black Earl be whipped on your show.  I am outraged. 
[16:00]
 Anthony's defense.  He wanted no part of it.  I wanted no part of it.  I didn't want any part of it for break out the tape.  I just wanted to stand back and watch and enjoy.  It was so wrong.  But I don't know.  There was there was funny as hell.  Well, I don't see how race has to come into it.  We brought Ben in, Ben the fag came in bent over the counter.  And I don't think he was too willing. 
[16:30]
 And he got whipped by Spike.  But then Black Earl being whipped, all of a sudden there, there's a problem.  Why don't the activists come out to Ben the fags?  Defend.  Well, a couple of gay groups have called us out there.  That's something about gay bashing.  Ben isn't even gay.  I know. That's the problem.  That is the problem here.  The boy guy has a nickname Ben the fag.  He's not gay.  It's probably the worst nickname for a straight guy to have.  And now gay groups are coming to defend him.  So the gay groups are coming out of the woodwork to defend Ben the fag, who's not even gay. 
[17:00]
 Right.  And black activists are coming out of the woodwork to defend Black Earl.  Who really doesn't want their defense.  Who doesn't want their defense?  We're like a radar jamming system for groups.  We confuse the hell out of all of them, I think.  Yes, we do.  They've got a gay group defending a guy who isn't gay.  But his name is Ben the fag.  And we've got the black guys defending Black Earl.  And he's the whitest black guy I've ever met in my life. 
[17:30]
 So who's called Black Earl because he wears black?  That's the only reason we call him.  Check the pictures.  Yeah, check the pictures for yourself.  He wears black every single day here at N.E.W.  He even said on April Fool's he's going to wear all white or something just to freak everyone out.  A white polyester suit.  But we have been here eight months.  We've never seen Black Earl wear anything but black.  You must stop this insanity.  We will never listen to N.E.W. again.  Like we were listening anyway. 
[18:00]
 We've got to call Scott Herman and see if he's gotten the calls.  Upstairs?  I'm really curious.  Have they been filtered or have they gone upstairs?  Who knows?  All right, but the pictures are on the website for you to judge for yourself.  But it looked like Earl was enjoying himself.  Gee, I sure hope Reverend Al doesn't call in about this.  I have a feeling he just might.  I certainly hope he doesn't.  Boy, that would be horrible.  Stay tuned to see if he doesn't call in. 
[18:30]
 By the way, there's a comment about Ben the Fag and the instant feedback.  Wait a minute, you got a pen?  Yeah, start writing the Reverend Al.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Ixnay on the Reverend Al Sharpton A.  But they're talking about Ben the Fag.  And they're like, Ben is obviously gay.  And then they said Liberace hit it better than Ben the Fag.  Oh my God.  Because there's a picture of Ben on the website in the background of all the mayhem that was going on last night.  By the way, first picture of Tara on Spike's body has come in. 
[19:00]
 Whoa!  Is that bizarre looking?  Get out of here!  It doesn't quite work.  Good work, but not quite good enough.  It's a little odd, isn't it?  Well, you've got to keep the blonde hair on Tara.  Because they put the face on.  Yeah, they just put transferred faces.  Right.  But it kind of looks freaky.  It does look freaky.  You've got to keep the blonde hair on Tara.  Whoever sent that, do it again with the blonde hair on Tara.  You guys are having just too much fun with this whole damn thing. 
[19:30]
 Hey Earl.  Yes, sir.  Are we ready for tomorrow, by the way?  Yes, sir.  We are so psyched for this, man.  We want everybody to join us.  Get there early.  We're going to start broadcasting 3 o'clock.  Longshore Brewery.  Garden City.  We've got music.  Hygienics.  We're sending a couple of people to Miami.  We have two trips to Miami.  Thanks to Priceline.  It's going to be fun.  We have Tara and Spike showing up.  You get to see Black Earl. 
[20:00]
 I might show you his ass to show you where the whip marks are.  These things are known to just snowball once we get them started.  So get there early and just be prepared for a damn good time.  Live fun.  Got to give it to Earl, too.  He worked his ass off to help us with this live broadcast tomorrow.  We've got some interesting stuff to give away.  It's just going to be great.  Make sure you get down to the Longshore Brewery tomorrow.  The Rock of New York 1027WNAW. 
[20:30]
 That's Creed from their debut CD.  My Own Prison is the name of the CD.  That's a track called One.  A band from Tallahassee, Florida doing quite well with their first CD.  Sophie and Anthony.  Hey!  There's so much excitement around the NAW studios.  It's just so good to feel this excitement finally coming from this radio station.  When was the last time there was this kind of excitement?  The live broadcast from the original Woodstock?  I don't know.  But the halls are happening. 
[21:00]
 People are running all over the place getting ready for our live broadcast tomorrow at the Longshore Brewery.  They have a purpose, Opie.  They're running around like crazy.  It's great to see.  It's going to be fun tomorrow when we broadcast live in Garden City from 3 to 7.  I'm psyched because we were listening to Spike and Tara talking to each other on the phone, our two competitors.  They're showing up tomorrow.  Both of them.  God knows what's going to happen on that stage.  Tara, maybe in her cute little lingerie.  And Spike in that latex suit. 
[21:30]
 Just opposite ends of the spectrum.  That latex outfit from Hell.  Did we also mention Mindy from Big Butt Magazine is going to be there?  Is she?  Yeah, that's what Rick said.  She's aboard for our party?  She's going to...  If you're into fat asses, you'll be into her.  Well, she's got the title for the fattest ass to show up on our show.  Yeah, we'll give her like a little crown and a Twinkie or something.  Then we've got Stephen Lynch. 
[22:00]
 We've got you and your brother doing some parody.  It's just going to be absolutely sick tomorrow.  And people are running around still preparing for tomorrow's broadcast.  Also, we're taking the FU Friday on the road, obviously.  So we're encouraging you guys to get your FU faxes in today  so we could just put them all in a folder and read them while we're on the air  tomorrow down there in Garden City.  So the fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  And if you're going to be there live, we'll take your FUs live.  That's true.  Now, are we bringing this thing down there in?  What do you got? 
[22:30]
 Are we bringing...  What?  I mean...  Oh, my God.  What?  What is that?  This could be the trophy for, like, hottest girl ever to pose naked on our show.  We could, like, we could put some writing on this,  and this will be the official trophy.  That is a reproduction of the male organ in large size, I must say.  Mm-hmm.  Atop a hoppity-hop type ball.  Yeah.  And I guess you're supposed to climb aboard. 
[23:00]
 Well, yeah.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  We've got to thank the gang from PleasurePlay.com  for donating a lot of the stuff we're giving away tomorrow.  Yeah, Pleasure Play came through,  and they're going to be giving away some of the consolation prizes.  Yeah, I just don't know what you're supposed to do with this.  For Valentine's Day, Opie, I think somebody could find a use for that.  So you think we should bring this down with us?  Sure.  Okay.  You could give it away.  Maybe someone will want to try it out, take it for a test run. 
[23:30]
 I guess you just climb aboard and hop.  And it doesn't need a handle, because you'll be holding on with some other region.  All I have to say is, when it gets down to this, you might as well just give up having sex.  If you've got to mount a dildo on a hoppity-hop, just give it up.  Some people are into that.  Some people are into the pleasure aspect.  I'm sure a lot of people buy this as a goof gag,  but I'm sure there are other people that really use this.  Well, the goof gags get dangerous when you're getting frisky 
[24:00]
 with your significant other around the house, maybe have a couple of drinks in you.  And then it comes out and you're like, hey, let's give that a try.  And it just gets ugly.  Don't ask me to explain how I know that.  But I don't know.  I guess we could bring this down.  Yeah, we'll bring that down.  We'll put this on display tomorrow.  We'll give it to somebody.  And is it true?  Well, we shouldn't talk about all the gifts that we have.  All the fun little gifts.  No, but of course they tie into the Valentine's Day festivities. 
[24:30]
 And if you don't have a Valentine, maybe you could use some of these gifts.  Okay.  That's all.  Also, more excitement on the radio starting tomorrow as well.  We're starting that Grammy trip.  We're all weekend long.  You've got a chance to win seven-pack CD sets from Aerosmith, Matthews, Hole, Pearl Jam.  The list goes on and on.  And then one of the winners from the weekend will be flying out to LA for the Grammys.  That starts tomorrow as well.  So as you can see, the station is finally coming to life.  Yes.
