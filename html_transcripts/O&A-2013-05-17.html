<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter before shifting to Anthony's tardiness, blamed on oversleeping.  Travis recounted seeing Colin Quinn's one-man show,  "Unconstitutional,"  detailing the difficulties of securing a babysitter and referencing a local news story about a nanny murdering children.  The conversation segued into their social circles and choosing companions, revealing their friendship hierarchy.  Travis described an awkward post-show encounter with Bob Kelly, whose impending fatherhood and anxieties were discussed, alongside the contrasting experiences of pregnancy for women and men.  They also mentioned seeing Jerry Seinfeld at Quinn's show and the unique challenges of interacting with him.

A significant portion of the show centered on a mysterious package sent to Travis, revealed to be a crystal decanter and glasses from Paul Anka, leading to much speculation about the gift's meaning.  This was followed by a surprise call to Barry Williams (Greg Brady), initially mistaken for a voicemail, resulting in a humorous and somewhat awkward conversation.  The hosts reminisced about past encounters with Williams, including visiting his home, and planned a future show at his Branson, Missouri home. The death of a mutual friend was also mentioned.

The show further discussed Barry Williams' 70s-themed show in Branson, playing a promotional video showing him in a Johnny Bravo jacket performing to a less-than-enthusiastic audience.  They revisited past Williams appearances, including an incident where a couple had sex in the studio.  The conversation then circled back to Paul Anka, including Anka’s past gift of a decanter to Colin Quinn, and the awkwardness of interacting with Jerry Seinfeld.  Upcoming guests, including Colin Quinn, Guy Fieri, and possibly Trace Adkins, were mentioned, along with a tangent on Trace Adkins' ice cream preferences and children's unusual observations, prompting a planned segment on parental anecdotes after the break. The hosts also discussed their own behavior around high-profile guests.

The show heavily featured Colin Quinn’s “Unconstitutional,” including a joke about the Second Amendment.  They discussed the set's previous use for a Stonewall riot show and the awkwardness of introducing someone to Jerry Seinfeld.  Other topics included the hosts' relationship, Opie's childhood, Jason Ellis' dislike of Sam Roberts, a listener-submitted song about E-Rock, a promotional video for a fictional gay porn film starring Anthony Cumia, a phone call with Tom Papa, the Celebrity Apprentice ice cream challenge (featuring Penn Jillette and Trace Adkins), and Danny Aiello's alleged past.  E-Rock and Sam Roberts were present in the studio.

The show also included speculative commentary on Richard Nixon, a discussion about a musician named Sean F. potentially freelancing for the show (without E-Rock's knowledge), further discussions about Colin Quinn's show and Bob Kelly's reaction, a humorous segment about Jim Norton's muffin-eating habits, a story about a missed lunch with Guy Fieri, a brief discussion of David Beckham's retirement and British tabloids.  Tom Papa joined the show, followed by Trace Adkins, whose life story, including his work on oil rigs, a shooting incident, his Celebrity Apprentice participation (and his unique ice cream flavor), his political views, and gun ownership, were extensively discussed.  Guy Fieri also joined, contributing to conversations about food, books, and travel plans.  Throughout, profanity and vulgar language were prevalent.

A significant portion was dedicated to Trace Adkins' run-ins with the law regarding firearms, including a Canadian jail stay. He recounted numerous anecdotes involving guns, alcohol, and incidents during travels and shoots.  The complexities of US gun laws were also touched upon.  Other guests present in the studio included Guy Fieri, Colin Quinn, and Tom Papa.  The hosts and guests also discussed an upcoming week-long road trip, described as potentially chaotic and involving multiple buses, fans, alcohol, and women, with stops in Memphis, Nashville, and Austin.  Maple ice cream preferences were also discussed, along with the possibility of Guy Fieri catering the trip.  The segment ended with plans for future broadcasts and a mention of a continuing segment with Sam Roberts.

Finally, a phone call with Nicole from the "Morning Man" show detailed a crying episode, a fight with her husband Ryan, who left to play golf,  conflicts with her boss, and menstruation-related issues. Opie and Anthony offered commentary, including a comment on Nicole's appearance. The segment ended with a plug for their Facebook page and a transition to Ron and Fez.

And then I get here at 5.30  And it's just me anyway  Nobody gets in at 5.30 anymore  I slept in a little bit myself today  Cause I went and saw  Colin Quinn's Unconstitutional  Last night  Was it good?  It was excellent  At the Barrow Theater  Downtown  A small little theater 
[00:04:00]  And yeah  Colin Quinn's new  One Man Show  Is terrific  It's gonna do very very well  And I'm sure  They'll move it uptown  Eventually  Just like they did  They did with the last one  Yeah  Yeah just fucking around  With the Constitution  Very very funny shit  A lot of really good jokes  In there  What's he doing?  Like analyzing it?  Uh yeah  And I had to go by myself  Because everyone  Blew me off  Sam Roberts  Everyone  I was in Westchester  Once I'm in Westchester mode  You know 
[00:04:30]  It starts with the wife  She couldn't go  Cause we got the two kids  And we have no family around  So it's hard to get babysitters  That we trust  That we know  Won't fucking hatchet  Our kids to death  Yeah  That story's in the paper again today  Remind me  Oh yeah  Be very careful  Who comes into your home  To watch your kids  Why?  Were you thinking about  Getting a homeless drifter  To watch them?  Well  I'm not even talking about  That story  Oh  I'm talking about  The nanny story  That actually did that  Oh yeah  She butchered two young kids  Obviously  They got another one coming  And that's  That was  That's in our neighborhood 
[00:05:00]  We need hatchet control  In this country  We had a fucking nanny  That this family  Thought they trusted  And the mom comes home  To find  You know  A horrific scene  I'm not talking about Kai  We'll talk about Kai  In a couple minutes here  So  The wife couldn't go  To see Colin Quinn  So then I went  And called Sam Roberts  Yeah  And Sam Roberts could not go  And yeah  That's why I called you  E-Rock  I'm sorry  You didn't have to  Give the order out  Well he knows though 
[00:05:30]  So why don't we  That's why I said no  I know  But we should put it  Out there in the open  He knows he's third  On the list at this point  Yeah but I mean  I would have certainly  Enjoyed my time with E-Rock  If he could have went  You think so  But I called E-Rock  Because you know  You couldn't go  That's unfortunate  And your wife  And my wife  Right  Yeah  I mean I understand  The wife thing  It's just I wouldn't  Want to hear that  So you'd like  But that's not a bad position  E-Rock  I'm not complaining  That's not bad  He should be  He's such a glutton  For punishment 
[00:06:00]  But that's not bad  Beat Roland  I would be complaining  Oh no Roland  Was in there too  Oh no  No Roland was in there  Sal had free time  He could have went  No Sal's not even  A thought  But  You didn't miss a beat  With that one  I actually almost  Texted you Travis  But I'm like  You would have  Sure  He had your number  No I was  You know what  I swear to god  I was going to text you  Alright you know what  You're officially on the list  To call  In that one sentence  You just jumped ahead of E-Rock  I think so yeah 
[00:06:30]  Yeah no Roland is like  A close  He's like a close third  To E-Rock  Meaning you start with me  Or you start with the wife  Gotta go with the wife  Okay so E-Rock's now fourth  Yeah  Or a close third  Well which one is it  Roland or E-Rock third  It kinda  Could go either way  Depending on what the event is  Like  The places  And restaurants  And things like that  If it's  If it's a sporting event  It's Roland obviously  Right  If it's a concert  It's Roland obviously  If it's going out to dinner  It's Roland  If it's going out to dinner 
[00:07:00]  It's Roland obviously  Okay  Or to a Broadway show  Or to a movie screening  If it's just hanging out  At the house  If it's a movie screening  It's Roland obviously  Hanging out at the house  Obviously  Oh no  Roland  No Roland  Creeps out my kids  So I think E-Rock  Wins there  E-Rock's very good  With my kids  It's cause he brings in presents  Every time he sees him  He does  He can play with the same toys  Yes he brings my son  Especially stuff that  He would like to play with  Why don't we open it now  But it kind of works  It kind of works  Yeah  Here I'll show you how to play 
[00:07:30]  Your son's just crying  Because E-Rock's not sharing the toys  Right  You're not doing it right  Yeah it's very very strange  They're on the same level  With toys  You're just sitting there  Checking your numbers  While your son and E-Rock  I check my numbers  As E-Rock's on the floor  Like playing trains  Playing trains with my kid  Or Batman  It's a beautiful thing though  Yes  So Colin Quinn's show  Is excellent  And you know  The whole world is  Looking forward to his appearance  On this show today  So  We're fortunate to have  Colin Quinn  So I walked into the theater 
[00:08:00]  By myself  Which is so fucking awkward  You don't like doing that?  No  Sometimes I like  Just sitting by myself  Really?  Yeah I like going to movies  By myself  No I don't mind going to movies  By myself  Because who cares?  What are you supposed to have  A conversation with the person  You went with?  Oh I see  So you go and see this show  That's obviously a conversation piece  Because it's about the constitution  Right  And issue  And then you walk out of there  Where you like turn to the stranger  What did you think?  I try to sneak out  And then Bob Kelly's outside  Like hey  Lonely  Where you going? 
[00:08:30]  Like I'm trying to sneak out  Without looking like an asshole  Because there was an after party  Right after  And that's the other thing  You're going to a Colin Quinn show  Who knows you  It's right there  In the village  So the comics are around  They know you  So people are going to be aware  Right  That you just showed up by yourself  Yes  Yes I was trying to make that  Not as obvious  Right  But of course Bob Kelly  Has to shout it  As I'm trying to like  Sneak away  Hey lonely  And then he touches me  And I jump  And he goes  Relax 
[00:09:00]  Was molested  I'm like  No  Maybe I just don't want you touching me  It doesn't mean I was molested  Right  Everything with him has to be  A molestation joke  Yeah  What is that about?  How come he didn't go with you?  He went with his wife  Oh  His very pregnant wife  Who looks excellent  You could have just sat with them  And then  Oh yeah  I didn't know you were coming  And then all three of you  Were together all of a sudden  The seats were very very tiny  Not much fucking room at all  Very small strange theater  The Barrow Street Theater 
[00:09:30]  So  Was it like the theater  Where he previewed his first show?  Yeah pretty much  Yeah  A little small  Out of the way place  And then I guarantee  They're going to move it uptown  And then eventually  It'll be on HBO  You watch  So  But Bob Kelly's going to be  A father any day  He's two weeks out  Wow  And he's fucking panicking  He is?  Oh yeah he is  He's panicking  Because he knows  Just because two weeks out  Means that  Like you said  Literally any day  This baby can fall out  He's in the  Any day mode  Right  And his wife's like  Yeah you know  I'm getting 
[00:10:00]  You know  Great sleep  And he's up all night  Just panicking  He's panicking  He's not pregnant  Why is he panicking?  I don't know  I guess  Because it's a big deal for him  Yeah it's a big deal  For anybody probably  I just  I feel like  He told me he can't sleep  Right  Like  Yeah he's just up all night  On the computer and shit so  I feel like if the wife  Is chilled about it  Yeah  Then I would be like  Okay well if she's got  Her shit handled  I guess it'll be okay  Well it's  It's  It's quite a thing though  Yeah  I don't know if I panicked 
[00:10:30]  Just the sitting  Sitting around waiting  For the whole show to begin  Was what  What gets to you I think  Yeah imagine if the baby  Was inside of you  No kidding  I would imagine  For the girls  It's gotta be hell  Dude women are way more  Amazing than men  In the end  Because they can handle that shit  Yeah you're gonna have kids right  Yeah  Alright  You'll see  You just realize  That women are  Way more amazing  Than men  Period  I couldn't imagine  Like I couldn't even imagine  A guy could never handle  Being pregnant  Imagine knowing 
[00:11:00]  That you had to take a shit  But you couldn't take a shit  And you never know  When it's gonna come out  Right  But you know the shit's in you  Oh yeah  Just  Who drive me nuts  When a woman's pregnant  It just squishes  Everything inside  You know all that shit  You have inside  Yes  Well when a woman  A woman is pregnant  It just squishes everything  It makes it incredibly uncomfortable  To do everything  Yes  And then they pop that sucker out  And there's fists and feet  Kicking you  Yes  From the inside of your stomach  Yes  You're trying to get  A good night's sleep  Women are amazing 
[00:11:30]  Always knew it  But you know  Even more so  Since going through  The whole birthing process  A couple times  And not only that  But the dread  Of actually having to  Go through that process  Would be enough  To freak me out  Like knowing that  A person is gonna be  Shoved out of  You know  A tiny little hole  Right  No  No  Not for me  It's not for any guy  No  That's why we fucking  You know  Make big muscles  On our body  Yeah  To say  To say

[00:12:30]  A social person  I know  I would be scared  Everyone in the room  Kind of knows it  Yeah  Did anybody try to get  Pictures with him  Because I'm lucky enough  I'm lucky enough  To be in that circle  Every once in a while  Like it's a  It's a circle of people  So I  I've been in situations  Where Seinfeld's been  In the room a few times now  And you just know  You just don't go up to him  And talk to him  Yeah like  Tom Papa  Ken who was there  Sure  I mean  I saw it happen  Seinfeld actually  Recognized Tom Papa  Hey  And they had a little  Trick chat  I know  Yeah  Me not so much 
[00:13:00]  I know  And then Tom Papa  Saw me  And I'm like  No I'm not going  To do this to you  It's okay  Right  I think he was  A little scared  Like he  He saw that I was there  But he was having  A little chit chat  With Seinfeld  And I  It was my move  To go over  And say  Hey Tom  Just walk over  In between them  And wait to be  Introduced to Seinfeld  And then I get  A couple minutes  With Seinfeld  But I saw  The panic in his eyes  Like please don't  Do this to me  And I'm like  I'm not going  To do this to you  It's all good  That's crazy  The aura  That Seinfeld has  That even if you're  His buddy  Like even if you're  A legit friend of his

You talk about it constantly  Yeah but the silent part  Means I don't have  To do anything  Like I'm kind of like 
[00:18:30]  Jim Cook  Jim Cook actually  Doesn't make the beer  Right  But he's out there  As a spokesperson  So  You're a celebrity spokesperson  Yeah in a way  I'm like a spokesperson  For my brother's restaurant  F.H. Riley's  In the heart of Huntington Village  400 New York Avenue  The place is doing  Terrific business  But what's the empty promises  And gonna expand soon  Huh?  What's the Guy Fieri  Empty promises?  Well like he invited us  To that restaurant  Of his in Times Square  Yeah and he gave us  Free food  Yeah but that  See  You  You got a lot to learn 
[00:19:00]  Sam Roberts  I can teach  You're still very green  Yeah  I remember those days  When that was good enough  For me too  But if Guy Fieri says  You know  Hey let's have lunch  I'm thinking  We're gonna have lunch  Not I'm gonna show up  And he waves from  Across the room  And goes  Oh you guys  Taking care of  I'm like  I think so  And then you know  He comes over  Like as we're  About to leave  To say  Hey how was everything  And he gave us  Some free swag  No that was all good  But I was thinking  I was gonna actually  Have lunch with Guy Fieri 
[00:19:30]  I wasn't thinking that  Maybe you are the one  Who's naive  I was like  Nah Guy Fieri  Maybe I'm still hoping  Yeah you're just hopeful  Travis you got a guess  On the big gift  I'm gonna guess  Paul Anka  But I think Anthony  Was here for that interview  Anthony was not here  For the Paul Anka interview  Oh then I'm gonna guess  Paul Anka  And you would be correct  Yes  Why is Paul Anka  Sending you gifts  He's Paul Anka  So once again  Dear Greg  What a great way  To start the morning  I really loved it  And look forward  To the next time  With much respect  And that next time  Is next week 
[00:20:00]  Yes  What  I don't know  What's going on  With Paul Anka  He really had a good time  Why the fuck  Is Paul Anka  Coming back  He was just here  I know  I don't know  He like  Cause when Roland said it  He goes  I go  Why is Paul Anka  Coming back so soon  He goes  He really had a good time  He's been in the business  For 70 years  Yeah  He hung out with Frank Sinatra  And he now wants to hang out  With Opie and Anthony  And Jim Norton  How does it make you feel  You've been talking all week  About not having celebrity friends 
[00:20:30]  Now Paul Anka  Is all on your nuts  Imagine  Fast forward a couple more weeks  I can't get rid of Paul Anka  Paul Anka  And this becomes really creepy  He thinks you, Ant, and Jim  Are the new Rat Pack  I know  What a drop off  Yeah  What is he doing  He used to hang out with Sammy  And Dean  And Frank  And now it's  Opie and Anthony  And Jim  Does that mean he just sits at home now  With all his celebrity friends like dead  So he's trying to make new ones  I don't know, man  I think it's really cool  But it's a little strange  You'd think he could hang out with like 
[00:21:00]  Musicians  Like he'd still be in the scene  Right  Do you know what's in the box?  I do not  I'm thinking it could be the cologne  That's what I would guess  I would guess a severed head  So Jim didn't get a gift?  You know what?  I mean  Not to spoil it  But I think  He did send Jimmy the cologne  Oh  So I'm assuming  This is my cologne  That he promised me as well  That is quite a big  He'd send you a giant bottle of cologne  It's like two liters  Yeah  What is it?  It's called  Cove? 
[00:21:30]  Cove collection?  Cove maybe?  Cove probably  Oh yeah, Cove  I don't know why Cove would be your first guess  It's called C-O-V-E  I'm going to figure out how to read eventually  You just wait  Yeah, it's a giant  Of course it's Cove  I don't know why I just said Cove  It's a giant bottle of Cove cologne  The box is probably nine inches tall  It's really heavy  Like this is ridiculous  I'm not bringing this home  It's a giant crystal bottle  This is really heavy  You shouldn't say in the air  You're not bringing it home 
[00:22:00]  No, I'll bring it home  Because, you know  It's Paul Anka  He's coming back anyway  He can say whatever we want  What the fuck?  Look at this thing  It's like really nice crystal  Look at this shit  That's just the top  The top of the bottle is wrapped separately  In like a protective wrap  Right  To make sure it doesn't get ruined  And then  What the  And then there's another fucking package here  Oh my god  This is the  This is just the empty container  It's just  He sent you just a crystal bottle 
[00:22:30]  To put your Cove in  Right  I'm going to have to do it before and after  I got the  I got the  The gifts unwrapped  And then  So does that mean  I'll have them wrapped  A picture of them wrapped as well  So that's the cologne  I guess  In the other box  Yeah  What the fuck  And what  You guys now pour the cologne  Into the canter  Wait, no  That's not cologne  What  He sent you  Like a bottle and glasses  Like that's for putting whiskey in  Wait, I don't get fucking cologne  No  He sent you like a  Like that's like 
[00:23:00]  Maybe that's why he's coming back  He's going to hand deliver it to you  These are very nice though  I'm looking online  It's a very nice gift  That's like when  Like in Mad Men  When they had the cart  Yeah  With like the drinks  I got a Cove crystal decanter  Look this shit up  Maybe we can resell it  All right  It's a  Let me check it out  It's about $100 right there  And then  Okay, I get it  And then really nice crystal glasses  Yeah, it's a drinking set  Dude, this is a really, really nice gift  We should save them  I'm going to a wedding soon  This is going to be perfect  Yeah, wrap that shit back up 
[00:23:30]  I'm going to wrap this shit  This is like a perfect wedding gift  Why did he send you that?  It's Paul Anka  I don't  I don't really  I don't really drink  That's the problem  See, you know what  Why this is at risk  When celebrities do it?  What do you put in this decanter?  It's not like a wine decanter  I think whiskey  Juice  Like whiskey or gin  Yeah  Maybe a nice vodka  But now  When Paul Anka was first coming in  Right  The idea was  Holy shit  Paul Anka's in studio with us 
[00:24:00]  Now it's like  What's Paul Anka doing?  Why is he giving you gifts?  Yeah, does this make you feel like  You think less of him, right?  It completely strips away his famous guy, Mystique  Right  I don't think Elvis was walking around  Giving gifts out like this  Or they'd be weird  To like radio nobody  Yeah, exactly  He wasn't sending disc jockeys decanters  Holy fuck  That's like  Jeez, Paul  Relax  Yeah, we'll have you back on  It was a book interview  Dude, I want to break this so bad  I'm getting that urge 
[00:24:30]  How funny would it be  If Paul Anka came back in  And you could pretend it was a mistake  But you could announce you're going to do it  Yeah  And say like  Oh, you gave me this great  Cove decanter  And then you dropped it  And it shattered it  In front of his face  That is fucking really nice  Now it's going to be awkward  I've got to thank him and stuff  When he comes in here  Holy shit  He's coming in next week  Yeah, but I wanted the cologne  That's all I wanted  The decanter is $100  Really?  Yes  And 
[00:25:00]  This sure beats Dr. Steve's homemade wine  I'll tell you that much  Oh, God  Dr. Steve should just stop  Going to the post office after this  By the way  Is this good enough stuff  For the podcast next week?  I feel like it  Well, Paul Anka  Thank you very much  But now I feel really  Like awkward  You should put this on the podcast  Just so people know  That Paul  Everybody possible  Yeah  Is aware that Paul Anka  Is sending you  Drinking paraphernalia  Look, it's a nice little card 
[00:25:30]  With his autograph  He wrote that out himself  You could just tell  What a lonely man  He did  He is  He's got to be very lonely  And he's coming back next week  Why?  He doesn't even live in New York  He's probably just flying in  To do the show  I think he's finally flying back  To, I believe, Beverly Hills  What does he have to promote?  I don't know  His book again?  I am reading his book  And it is pretty good  So  It's really good, actually  There's a lot of good stories in there  Yeah, but now  He used to be  The famous guy  Who produced all his songs  Who wrote these songs 
[00:26:00]  Who hung out with the Rat Pack  Right  Now he's the weird old man  That sent you a decanter  I know  I'm not going to read this guy's book  I thought it was the cologne  And then he just gave me  Some kind of nice little decanter thing  I could put my cologne in  He's old school, though  Like, he probably thinks  That that's something that's done  Right  Not that he's the only person  That's ever done it  In the history of the radio show  How rich is he  That he's just sending gifts  To, you know, people that interviewed him  Oh, he's got money  On his book tour  But he went to the mall himself  And bought it  Yeah, he probably thinks  That that's what people do 
[00:26:30]  Well, he is old school  That's what people used to do  Exactly  Like, you know  You send Carson  A nice whatever  You send Opie and Anthony  A decanter and some cologne  Four really nice crystal glasses  A really nice crystal decanter  Dude, you play  He called you Greg in the card  You could be Paul Anka's friend  Yeah, I know  He didn't write Opie  Because to him  He's like, oh, God  I think you could be  Paul Anka's friend  Yeah  He had to find out  What your name was  I know  Yeah, you didn't introduce yourself  No one knows your real name 
[00:27:00]  I mean, you know  A lot of listeners do at this point  But a guest wouldn't know my real name  Dude, this is so much better  Than Greg Brady  A Paul Anka friendship  Is way better  Than a Greg Brady friendship  Yeah  Yeah  You should have called him last night  And said  Maybe I could go see Colin with you  Maybe I could check out  Bel Air again  I'll bet you can get  That's where Greg Brady used to live  You can get  Oh, he used to  Which is very  What happened?  Why doesn't he live in Bel Air anymore?  Well, you know  He got a divorce  And I learned 
[00:27:30]  Over the years  That he might have been  Living in Bel Air  Because of his wife  Oh, no  His wife had money  Maybe she became  The breadwinner  After the Brady Bunch  Reunions dried up  He lived in Bel Air  At the top of one of those mountains  Overlooking everything  Not anymore  That was a past  Everything  But he invited me  Over to his house  Gave me his address  And everything  That's sick  I remember being in LA  Driving up  This  This like 
[00:28:00]  Mini mountain  In Bel Air  Looking at the numbers  Of the houses  You know  Trying to find  Where Greg Brady lives  And I called  I called a really good  Friend of mine  Freaking out  Like a little  Fucking schoolgirl  I'm going to Greg Brady's house  I'm like  You're not going to believe this  What  I'm driving to Greg Brady's house  I had to tell people  I'm going to tell someone now  And then I  And then I called  Look  Brady Bunch is on TV  As I speak  Or some weird  Fucking commercial  For the Brady Bunch  Or some fucking  They're using  A Mr. Brady clip 
[00:28:30]  For some  Publishers clearing out  Yeah  Is that what that is  Anyway  So then I called  Family member  I started calling  Everyone I know  As I was getting closer  To Greg Brady's house  I needed everyone to know  Where I was heading  Where are you at right now?  Yeah I'm just  Right  I'm just on my way  To Greg Brady's house  And then I parallel parked  In front of a  Ridiculous looking  Ridiculously  A ridiculous looking house  And then I walked up  To the  The gates  And I had to push the button 
[00:29:00]  And  And then  He  He's on the other end  I'm like  Hey  Hey  Barry  It's Hopi  Oh  You made it  Great  Let me budge in  And then I'm just  Gulping as I'm walking  Up the sidewalk  Going  I'm walking into  Greg Brady's house  It was the most  Surreal thing ever  It was so fucked up  Did he have  Brady Bunch memorabilia  On display?  Oh yeah  A lot of it?  Yeah but he had  The Brady Bunch episodes  I remember  He had all his  Brady Bunch episodes  On VHS tapes  I always thought  That was strange 
[00:29:30]  Is he watching them?  Hey honey  Let's put it another  This was about  Ten years ago  But I mean  People were definitely  You know  In the DVD world?  Oh yeah  Yeah  But I also thought  If you're Greg Brady  And you were on  The Brady Bunch  You know  They had other ways  To you know  Save this shit  Sure  But he was still  In the VHS world  They were all  Taped off TV  Right  So  And then I went  Back to Greg Brady's  House another time  And that's when  I had the famous  Leftovers  Because I kind of 
[00:30:00]  Came unannounced  Hey Greg  My name's Barry  Yeah Greg  Alright  I went up there  With my friend Jay  Who moved out to L.A.  And I was out in L.A.  I'm like  Hey why don't we go  Why don't we go  Say hi to Greg Brady  Yeah  Why don't we go say hi  I know where he lives  Don't even worry about it  Well because at this point  I'm like  Now I gotta take someone  To Greg Brady's house  Of course  Now that I've been there  Now I gotta take someone else  And did he give you  That open invite  Like hey come back anytime 
[00:30:30]  Yeah so I called him  You said it  And he's a really nice guy  Well when he came to New York  I had dinner with him  As well with a few people  He's a really nice guy  I'm kind of bummed  We've lost touch  Over the last few years  But anyway  So then I call him up  He goes yes  Come on over  We're about to  You know have  A little dinner or something  I'm like alright great  So I went with my friend Jay  And he invited us in again  And we had cocktails out  Overlooking everything  With an infinity pool  Ridiculous spot 
[00:31:00]  And then I remember  Being in his house  As him and his wife  At the time  Were looking in the fridge  Trying to figure out  What they're gonna  What they're gonna  Serve us  We gotta feed these guys  You didn't tell me  They were coming  I didn't know  They were coming  And Greg Brady  Had a beautiful  Like pasta dish  Yeah  That was fresh  Freshly made  And his wife  Same thing  And then I had  The leftovers  They didn't have  Enough pasta for you  I'd have to go back 
[00:31:30]  Into the archives  Because I used to  Tell people what I had  That day  Do you remember Iraq?  No I don't  I think I remember  There was some kind of  Peas in it  You'd be surprised Opie  It's not delivery  It's DiGiorno  Right  But I do remember  Them looking into the fridge  And you know  I remember thinking  Aw fuck  They don't have enough food  They're trying to figure out  What's cool enough  To serve me  Do you think  This caused their divorce?  I don't know  I have no idea  What caused their divorce  Your friends just keep 
[00:32:00]  Showing up?  No I only  I was only there  I think twice  Maybe three times  How did you lose touch?  It just time went by  And you just  Didn't talk to him?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah I don't know  What happened with that  Well you don't need him anymore  You have Paul Anka  In your life  I mean we were friends  But not friends friends  Yeah  Like I got friends  I haven't  You know  Like anyone else  I have friends  And you don't see him  For a bunch of years  And then all of a sudden  You see him  And you just pick up  Where you were  You should text him  We weren't on that level  You should text him again  And pretend you were  Yeah  Text him and be like  Yo Barry what up?

He signed a belt  That I didn't ask him to sign  And  Barry's table  How are we calling him?  He's on LA time  So it's  Like three in the morning  Yeah  Quarter to four in the morning  Right now  I hope it's someone else 
[00:33:00]  Oh yeah  It could be  Yeah  Changed the numbers  Oh  Hey  You've reached the original  Greg Brady  Say what?  That's him  That sounds like him  I didn't hear a beep  Where's the beep part?  Where's the beep?  Where's the beep?

[00:36:30]  That would be a very different conversation  If he wasn't on the air  He wouldn't have answered  If he was pissed  How funny was it  The realization  That that was not  His voicemail  Say what  I totally thought it was  I thought it was the coolest voicemail ever  Just say what  I thought he finally figured out  The voicemail thing  And then he's just on the phone  Not saying anything  While we're all saying  Where's the beep  Right  Oh Anthony just wrote  Hilarious  Holy fuck  This is great  What a morning  What a morning for broadcast 
[00:37:00]  Anthony just wrote  Hilarious  Holy fuck  Let's see  And then Dr. Steve  And Dr. Steve is mad at my gift  And how I'm talking about  His shitty gift  Well his gifts are shitty  And Paul Anka's gifts are not  Step it up  He just wrote  I don't know  That decanter sounds perfect  For some  Suck my  Pinot Noir  Tell Dr. Steve  You don't need him anymore  Greg Brady is back in your life  I'm not going to lie  I was a little scared there  I would imagine  I was a little scared  I thought he was going to get 
[00:37:30]  Really fucking mad  Because I actually really do like the guy  He's a solid guy  He's alright Barry Williams  Keep on  Keep on  Yeah  Are you going to go visit his house in Branson?  Holy shit  When we do the bus trip  Supposedly the bus trip is on  Yeah  I was given a date actually  A couple days ago  I forgot to mention that on the air 
[00:38:00]  Yeah  Did they want you to mention it on the air?  Sometime in September  I can say that much  Yeah  But they asked if I'm going to be available  And I said hell yeah  And if he's still in Branson, Missouri  We're going to hook up  And become friends again  Not only are we going to hook up  We're doing a show from his driveway  How do you like that?  That's right  That's right  How do you like that?  You said any time  We're doing a show from your driveway  Keep on  Yeah  Johnny Bravo is going to be  What's his name?  Johnny Bravo 
[00:38:30]  Johnny Bravo  Johnny Bravo is going to be performing  Time to get those tight bell bottoms on  I'm sure he still fits into them  Now I'm going to have to call him  I'm going to have to call him later  And apologize  But that whole say what thing  I'm waiting for the beep  And he's sitting there  Wondering what the fuck's going on  I never  It's five  It's an hour ahead in Branson  Oh that's not that bad  Wow  So it was like quarter to six  When he picked up the phone  Oh that's not bad  But if I haven't spoken to you  In years  Yeah it's  And it's quarter to six  And my phone rings 
[00:39:00]  Yeah  I'm not picking up the phone  Yeah  Somebody better have died  Well that's why I just  Shut off my phone  I actually lost a friend  I just found out last night  Dead?  Yeah  One of my fraternity brothers  That sucks  I just want to mention  Bob  Bob Pelkey today  He was a solid  Solid  Fucking dude  Man  And he died I think  Two nights ago  How'd he go out?  Ah sketchy  We're still trying to figure it all out  But he was a solid 
[00:39:30]  Solid dude  Because I know  I know I have a lot of people  That listen to us  In Rochester, New York  Where he's from  And I just want to  I just want to let the people know  He was a great  Great dude man  And he will be missed  Whole fraternity brother of mine  Yeah  I got the message  As I was leaving  Colin Quinn's  Show last night  Had you spoken to him in a while?  Honestly no  I'm not going to sit here  And make believe I did  I mean  You know we lost touch  Because I moved out of that area  Right  But I probably talked to him  A couple years ago 
[00:40:00]  About  What was the last time?  Really really good guy man  Always fucking laughing  And smiling  Just having a fucking great time  Wherever the fuck he was  So  Bob Pelkey  You will be missed  It's a good thing  You're increasing  Your friendship level  Then now  What do you mean?  Well now you got Greg Brady  Back in your life  So it's like  Do you think I got Greg Brady  Back in my life?  100%  I mean that  And possibly a Paul Anka  Friendship is blooming  Right in front of everyone's eyes here  Paul Anka is desperate  For the friendship  At this point 
[00:40:30]  You're  The pretty girl  Paul Anka  I don't know  It could be creepy  But it could be just old school  This is what old school people  Used to do  Yeah but it is old school  I think that's where the motivation is  That it's old school  But nobody does that anymore  Yeah  So I also think  Old school is like  You could see  A TV host  Or a big show host  And a guest  Become like  Famous people friends  Like that probably happened  More in the old school  Than now  Because now everybody  Has a show  So Paul Anka 
[00:41:00]  Is like of the mindset  Where it's possible  And feasible  That Opie  Or Greg  As he knows him  Right  Becomes friends  And they share  A nice glass of whiskey  From a decanter  That he bought him  But I think he's coming in  Next Tuesday  Now it's going to be  A little strange  Of course  It was strange anyway  Why the fuck  Do I have to acknowledge  He gave me a gift  Oh yeah  You should  And then  You think he's going to be  More like  Oh that's no big deal  That's just what  No you know what  That's just what  The Rat Pack used to do  Don't acknowledge it  But have the decanter  And the glasses  In front of you 
[00:41:30]  Don't say anything about it  With some fresh orange juice  In the decanter  Yeah  Just put your coffee in there  Put some juice in there  And then  I'm going to do that  Mid interview  Anybody need some OJ  And just start pouring out  You know  But we can only have  Tiny glasses of OJ  Obviously  Of course  It's a small decanter  Of course  I'm so not a drinker  I don't even know  What you put in this  I'm telling you  OJ  Anthony will be able to tell me  It's usually whiskey  Yeah I think it's whiskey  Probably a little whiskey  A little scotch  Some hard shit right  Yeah  Some of that hard shit 
[00:42:00]  Whatever you just want  To have a pinch of  Barry Williams was in a panic  He thought  He didn't know what was going on  He thought I was in full  Radio bit mode  And I was about to give  His phone number out  To the audience  To the audience  Yeah  Well it's good to know  That number still works  That's so funny  That he picked up  I'm sure the home number  Doesn't work anymore  If you know what I'm  Talking about  Somebody will pick it up  We should bring Paul  On the bus trip  But nobody in Branson  I got nothing to do  Yeah  Paul Anka  Go down and see Greg Brady  How great is that going to be  When we pull up  To Greg Brady's driveway 
[00:42:30]  Yeah  And do the Opie and Anthony show  In his driveway  And then we invite him on  For a segment  And that would be like  They're telling us  You gotta go  That would be very nice  See what would be great about that  Is you could just be  Totally pushy  Yeah  And like you're in the driveway  And obviously you're going to  Do an interview with him  And then you go  Why don't you show us  Around the house  And now he's got to  Show you around his house  He's got to bring you  In the garage  Anthony's coming down the hall  He's got to be jealous 
[00:43:00]  He's a big Brady Bunch guy  Wow that sounded really shitty  I thought the records  Slowed down  But I think that's just  How shitty the kids  Sounded back then  They were never strong singers  By the way  As Anthony's making his way in  Don't forget  My latest elevator show  Is up in  All the usual places  You put it on the  Facebook page  All right cool  How great was that  He's so pissed  Can you hear this  You can tell  He's so pissed  He was so pissed  But he also knew  Fuck I can't say anything 
[00:43:30]  Because I'm on the air  And I'm going to just  Look like an asshole  Dude there was a point  Where he  He was like  Ready to yell at you  Oh I know  Yeah  I know  You heard it in his voice  I'm scared  Not a joke  He was ready to fucking yell at you  I know I'm scared now  Because he goes  You call me for nothing  Right  But then  Right at that moment  That Ant's talking about  Well it was a goof  I didn't even know  If the number worked  So why not try it out  Live on the air  That's probably when  Realization set in  That oh shit  He's got me on the air  Yeah yeah  I can't yell at him  Right  Because I'll sound like a dick 
[00:44:00]  And you hear him  Opie  Yeah yeah  He lowered his voice  Opie  There was that  What  Like what  What  Opie  Oh he was mad  You're not going to give this number  Out to anyone are you  I'm like look  I've been cool  You know  I've had that number  Probably ten years at this point  Dude I thought he was in LA  I know  I was like oh my god  And I'm thinking  Like fucking 3.30 in the morning  Right  Yeah  And he's got  He's got kids right  Does he  Um yeah  I'm sure he's got loved ones  Yeah he's good  He lives with somebody 
[00:44:30]  Marsha  Cindy  I said um  Because I think his kids would be  You know  Obviously a bit older now  I'm trying to figure out  How old his kid or kids would be  But that early morning phone call  Is never good  It's never Greg Opie Hughes  Calling for the  You know  I love it  Radio show  But you hear the  I thought it was his voicemail  Yeah I know  Yeah yeah  You know  That would have been a cool voicemail  Right  Say what  Say what  So they were sitting there like  Alright where's the beep  I just want to quickly say  Hey it's Opie  I just want to  See if this number still works  Call me later  And then all of a sudden  It turns out 
[00:45:00]  Say what  You've reached the real  Greg Brady  Oh okay  Alright  I love the Opie  Opie  I might be Greg Brady  But I will have you killed  Okay  Yeah  I know people  He knows Buddy Hinton  It's pretty badass  And he probably knows him  To come beat you up  It's gonna be  6 a.m.  Eventually  Yeah  Eventually  It's like where are you  Oh  Branson  I felt bad for him though  When he said he was in Branson  Because Opie had just gotten over  Talking about his house 
[00:45:30]  In the hills  In California  And that was probably his wife  Yeah yeah yeah  Bella Air man  This place was ridiculous  It's where the Fresh Prince lived  That's right  Right  Yes  And there was Greg Brady stuff  All over the house  Brady Bunch stuff  All over the house  Oh gosh  He's just overlooking  Yakov's Dinner Theater  And then he had a nice  Home entertainment system  Nothing too crazy  Yeah  But then he had all his VHS tapes  Of the Brady Bunch right there  VHS Brady Bunch  I swear to god  It was all VHS 
[00:46:00]  So he could pull out  Any episode at any time  Boom  Greg caught smoking  It's right there  Boom  We stole the goat mascot  Right  Right the fuck there  Boom  Boom  The fucking UFO episode  And the Whistle in the House episode  Yeah  Wow  But you gotta  You have to think  They could have had a better way  To fucking archive that shit  Yeah you'd think  When you had  Greg Brady  He's over there  With his VHS collection  Of Brady Bunch tapes  Watching every episode  Peter comes in  Oh my god  And he's winging baseballs  At people for bringing up  The Brady Bunch  Oh boy

[00:49:00]  A mere two hours later  Paul Anke would have been  Like chasing you  Down the street  Opie  You'd have been like  Take it easy  Roger  Opie  Opie and Anthony  You did  Alright well  Have a good day  That's how it was  I don't know Paul  We talked to a lot of guests  I don't really recall  You  Paul  My dad would be  Fucking impressed  Oh my god  Right  Yeah mine would too  And look he used  My real name  And everything  Terrible  I know  Real name  Greg  Two G's 
[00:49:30]  So what's that about  That's getting personal  That's homework  Who did he ask  Fast forward  I'm playing golf  And just laughing it up  A crank  In Beverly Hills somewhere  It is an old school gesture  But it is also  A little bit sad  That he's like  These are the new guys  Let me tell you  Let me tell you  About the time  Sammy  And Frank  And Dean  And Dino  We're hanging out  And you're just like  Yeah  I'm trying to tee off here Paul  Right  A little quiet  Relax  A little quiet  Would be nice  I'll deal with another 
[00:50:00]  Stupid Rad Pack story  In a second  But  I need  Complete silence  When I tee off  Sinatra  Cumia  Right  He just expands  The whole Rad Pack  Right  It's a bit of a drop off  From Dean and Frank  Dean, Frank  Opie, Anthony  And Jim Norton  Norton  Norton  Dean, Frank, Norton  Norton, Cumia  And Opie  Oh boy  You know  Greggy Hughes  What  It doesn't quite work  Should we call Barry back  To make sure he's not  Oh my god  Dude the first time he called him  I was cringing in the car 
[00:50:30]  Isn't that the worst?  In the fucking way he's actually calling  Just  Just calling and saying  Hey Barry  I just wanted to make sure  You're not mad at me  Are you?  It was terrible  Just tell him you're over it  I was getting all like  Like my stomach was getting upset  When it was ringing  Yeah  I'm like please just have to be  The number you have reached  Is no longer in service  I was begging for that  And then how big of a cringe was it  When it was the moment  I don't think that's an answering machine  He was listening to that  Yeah  He was listening to you guys go  I didn't hear a beep 
[00:51:00]  Three guys in here  Say what?  Say what?  Three guys in here  Giggling  Yeah  He knows it's on speaker  He heard all of us  I know  Say what?  I'm like okay that's cool  Where's the beep?  I'll get out of this quick  I was praying  He wasn't going to answer  Why would he?  It's 5 o'clock in the morning  Who keeps his stupid cell phone on?  You think he's laying in a room  Whatever happens in the middle of the night  Can wait till the morning?  He thinks it's his big break again  His next big break  He's laying in a room in Branson, Missouri  It looks exactly like the room  Tom Hanks was in in Big  Yeah 
[00:51:30]  The fucking red light blinking  A little fucking bed  I got a top bug  And he's like  Oh my god  Not the loft  The shitty apartment  Yeah  That he had  That like halfway house  With the gunfire outside  Yeah  Licking Oreo cream  Off the Oreos  And the fucking phone rings  And it's Opie  And he's just like  Oh my god  You think he was  He was worried that he was getting bad news  About Jan or something?  Or his gig  His fucking 60's musical explosion  No 70's musical explosion 
[00:52:00]  70's music explosion  Yes  Hey Barry  It's Opie  Yeah  I'm coming to Branson  Yeah  I'm taking your theater though  Sorry buddy  I'm taking your gig  We're gonna broadcast from his driveway  We've decided  We'll do the bus tour  Do you think he's on stage?

We definitely have to stop in on him  Of course we're gonna stop in 
[00:52:30]  That would be rude  To go all the way to Branson  And not stop in and say hi  I actually really liked him  He was very cool  He's been nothing but a gentleman  He loved doing our show  He was a regular back in the NAW days  Not so much since we came back to Satellite  For whatever reason  Well wait till we broadcast  In some motherfucking driveway  I think he was on once maybe  When we first began back up  And then when he came to New York  He would call me up  And we'd go out to dinner and stuff  He was really  Really just a solid  Solid dude  Do you remember when he came on our show 
[00:53:00]  And performed  I'm Greg Brady  Yes I'm the real Brady  I sure do  Live  He didn't just have the fucking DVD  Or CD  And fucking  He sang it  Right  Live  That day  You got the live version  That he did  Yeah we'll play it to break  Alright we're gonna play it to break  And he also was in one day  When we had a couple having sex in the corner  Oh  Oh boy  Do you remember  Celebration  Yes  For the old school people  Was that christening the rug  Yeah we wanted to christen a brand new rug 
[00:53:30]  That the company got us  Because the old rug  Was so shitty  It's stained  And they finally decided  To put a new rug in  And we decided  The only way  To show our appreciation  Was to have a couple come in  And have sex on the rug  And Greg Brady  Was in that day  Yep  And we're talking to him  And he's like  Wait a minute  Why aren't you guys  Fucking acknowledging  What's happening in the corner  Mike  We saw so much sex  And nudity  That at that point  Didn't matter  There was actual sex  Happening  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Just full on sex  Full on sex  As we were just doing a radio show  Like we're doing today  Let me tell you something 
[00:54:00]  They're putting a new rug  Here in this studio  I say we do the same thing  Only a little different  We'll have each of us  With bowls of really  Full bowls of soup  Yeah  And we'll try to walk across  The room  And see if we spill any  On the carpet  That's just as good  Yeah  Yeah they will not  Let us christen the new rug  With the couple having sex anymore  Do the egg on the spoon race  Don't drop the egg  The yolk will splash  On the carpet  So nervous  Now what's this  This is a  70's music celebration

[01:08:30]  Uncomfortable  Yeah cause you're a  Huge Seinfeld  I'm a huge fan  But more so  I know him enough  To know it would be  The most uncomfortable  Like pulling teeth  Kind of interview  We would probably  Have him on eventually  For maybe like  A quick ten minutes  Maybe if he's in the  Building  Something else  Maybe  Roland fucking  Gets on his knees  And blows somebody  Nah  He might fucking  It would have to be  One of those weird  Things that just happens  They would never  Be scheduled  Jerry  Jerry  That kind  What if you're doing

[01:13:00]  The ice cream story  When we were growing up  Yeah  We had a friendlies  Right up the road  Oh yeah  And you know  We're  How many kids  Seven kids  At that point  Because we always  Had more kids  Coming and going  And it was time  It was ice cream time  And we would go  And get two  Two half gallons  Yeah  One half gallon  Was for my mom  And then everyone else  Had to share the other  Half gallon  Oh my god  So 
[01:13:30]  Because we were able  To pick two flavors  Yeah  But we weren't able  To pick two flavors  Because my mom  Got hers  Every single fucking time  And her  Her  Her ice cream of choice  Was maple walnut  Uh oh  So I had to  Take a liking  To maple walnut  Or I wouldn't get  Ice cream as a kid  Maybe you shouldn't  Have any of that maple  Then  Yeah  So it brings back  Weird  You might have a  Nom flashback  Nah  Start swinging  I ended up  Liking maple walnut  But not by choice 
[01:14:00]  How weird is that though  Two half gallons  One always had to be  Maple walnut  For mom  Yeah  And then everyone else  Had her share  Whatever the fuck  Other one we would get  I have a similar thing  That happened  My mother would  Buy ice cream  For herself  But she knew  We would fucking  Devour it  Right  Much like we did  Her brother's  Ice cream sandwiches  Right  When we were bummers  Right bummers  We were bummers  But she would buy  Coffee ice cream  And as a kid  That was just horrible  Horrible  It was horrible as a kid  I wanted vanilla chocolate  Fucking something nice and sweet 
[01:14:30]  Right  So that is very similar  Coffee  So every time  It was her flavor  Coffee  And then there was  Another flavor  For everybody else  Right  Yeah  She would buy  The flavor  That we liked  But we would just  Devour it so bad  It wasn't like her fault  She knew we would  Eat hers too  So you had to dig  Into the coffee  That's what happened  With us  You start digging  Into the maple walnut  Just get a little  Extra ice cream in you  And we would eat  Her AIDS diet plan chocolate  Right  I know  We ate AIDS  It was sucking  Her AIDS diet chocolate  I don't mind a good  Coffee ice cream  No 
[01:15:00]  Yeah  No  I love sherbet  Like a good sherbet  Yeah  The pushups  I'm not a good  I'm not a big sherbet fan  I do like those  Thematic  Like  Ice cream truck things  The pushup fucking thing  The thing with the fucking  Right  Different coatings on it  And candy inside  That shit was great  Strawberry shortcake  Strawberry shortcake  From the ice cream truck  Strawberry shortcake  And chocolate eclairs  And they make a new one like that  Called birthday cake  And it's like 
[01:15:30]  It's like a vanilla ice cream  With like sprinkles  And then cake flavored ice cream  On the inside  It's amazing  Do you chase after the ice cream man still  To get that  Ice cream  Ice cream  Do ya  Yeah  Jess can I have some money  For the ice cream truck  I'm in the ice cream man world again  Yeah  Yeah  This is a kid  But you live on the fucking  Millionth floor  What do you do  No  When you go  Parachute out  When you go to the park  Oh  I assume  I assume you never leave  No  I have to get out 
[01:16:00]  That's my thing  I hate just being at my house  Yeah  Imagine seeing an ice cream truck  From the millionth floor  Yeah  Yeah  And then running to the elevator  Pushing the bike  You miss it every time  You're like through the glass  There it is  We go to the ice cream guy  And my kid  Yeah you got all those great choices  And he goes for the stupid  Spongebob thing  Because he likes Spongebob  Wow  But Spongebob ice cream sucks 
[01:16:30]  Yeah  Because he only eats a little  And then of course  You know I can't help myself  I want to eat the rest of it  Yeah  What is it?  I try to point him to the chocolate shit  What is the Spongebob shit?  It's like a lemon sherbet bar  Yeah it's like a sherbet  Sometimes it has gumball eyes  Yeah it has  Exactly  The E-rock's kind of cool  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Yeah there it is right there  Enjoy the goldfish  That is just because it looks like Spongebob  He picks it because he knows Spongebob  And I'm trying to reason with the kid  Like look 
[01:17:00]  Creamy ice cream  Even though you don't know what that is  That's called a chocolate bar  Delicious  It tastes way better than Spongebob  You should buy them too  So you can taste each  Well that's what you would do Roland  That's what he does now  Yes  I bought you some different ice creams to sample  Yes  It's a sampling  A tasting  I get the oversized bomb pop  Of course you do  Yes see those are all the choices  I love a good bomb pop  They're great  Of course that's the exact choices  Oh let's see  So if  Oh my god  What is the worst looking one on that whole fucking 
[01:17:30]  Spongebob  Spongebob  Thank you and that's what he picks  And also because it's really low  So he can point to that  I'm like no look at all the chocolate shit we could have  Reese's  A Snickers thing  What's the Dora one?  He picks that one too  It's got fucking refried beans in it  Look at that  We all know what she is  No my kid is into  He got into Dora for a little while  I'm like fuck  Spongebob's cool because it has adult humor  Yeah  He's watching stoner cartoons now  Whoa 
[01:18:00]  Do you know Adventure Time?  Adventure Time yes  That's a stoner cartoon right?  Of course he rocked us  Yeah  Dude he loves it though  It's on the Cartoon Network  But you watch this as an adult going  This is a stoner cartoon  They made this for the purpose of  Of all the people that are high out there  I'm gonna love this shit  There's a lot of trippy stuff  Really trippy  But he loves it  That is weird  It's the guy from Futurama  Bender  Oh it is  But my wife doesn't know yet  So maybe I should shut up  Because I don't know if she would approve of this one 
[01:18:30]  It's really fucking creepy  It's like  It has to be in the right head to watch it  What's going on with that wormy thing?  It's a really strange cartoon  Do you have like a clip from Adventure Time?  But he's into this shit  And it's absolutely something you'd watch if you were really hot  I have the DVDs  Oh god  You like it?  You have DVDs of it?  But you don't even get stoned  No  He gets hungry  Why do you watch it?  Because it's a great cartoon 
[01:19:00]  Because I'm sitting there  It's one of those things that  Like you're pointing out  It's a little bit drug trippy  But it has adult humor in it that kids don't see  Oh yeah  How long is this clip?  11 minutes  We could just watch the first  Just a little bit  Yeah  But out of nowhere  Pause  Because  He finally started telling me  He wants to watch new shit  Because I'd just been  I'd just been giving him the same episode over and over again  And he finally was like  I want to watch something new  Yeah  So  I go to the kids section on demand  And I go  You know what? 
[01:19:30]  Let's just fucking do the first cartoon that pops up  And it's this Adventure Time  And we watch it  And then I moved on to something called  Regular Show?  No  64  The theme song for this is really creepy  Because it's English kids  64  Zoo  Zoo 64  Can you put 64 in?  Cartoon Network?  Yeah  Somebody will help me out  Anyway  So  I put on Adventure Time  As a throwaway  And we watched a few other things 
[01:20:00]  And then  We're laying around the other night  And he goes  Daddy  I want to watch  The  The  Firearm Guy  And I'm like  What?  Because I wasn't even paying attention  Oh boy  I'm a horrible parent  When it comes to what he should be watching  Because I just put it on  And assume it's good  He goes  No the fire guy  With firearms  And then I finally figured out  It was this Adventure Time  And it had some weird creepy  Like princess  Thing that had fire  Like she was a fire princess  Or something  With firearms 
[01:20:30]  That's fucked up  But the stuff  These kids remember  So anyway  It's this cartoon  Just start it up  Is it post-apocalyptic?  I don't know man  It's really just trippy  Bomb in the fucking green  Oh yeah  It's pretty trippy  Very psychedelia  This is very hipsterish  Hipsters love this 
[01:21:00]  I bet  He rocks the hipster  But he  His hips  You want some more eggs  Beemo?  Yes please  How about you  Finny?  Need a refill?  I'm pretty full man  Let me see if I can  Rearrange  I hear Bender's voice  Nope  Can't do it  I don't know if stomachs  Work like that dude  Sometimes it helps  Can't argue with that  This is more of a visual 
[01:21:30]  Obviously  But check it out  Check it out at home  Because it's really just trippy  It's not a kid's cartoon  I hope it doesn't give him nightmares  It might  No I can see a kid like that  You can?  Yeah  Yeah  It's very colorful  Yeah  It's fun to  Yeah it's fun  Spaghetti arm and leg people  What's the show I'm talking about?  64  64 Zoo  64 Zoo Lane  I'm going to try to get this stupid theme song  You got the theme song?

Yeah  I don't want to get that stuck in people's head today  It's weird  Can we play that a shitload?  I guess so  Just over and over again  64  Zoo  Little English kids sound hilarious 
[01:22:30]  They're adorable  Until you put them in a group of singing  Then it gets creepy  Yeah  Like Monty Python  Yeah  Yeah  There's something going on  I can't forget this  We've got to look into this  Because I was reading it on Twitter  Yeah  And it goes in with the kids and creepiness  Did you read that fucking article about  Just like creepy stories about kids and what they say? 
[01:23:00]  Like that  A father  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yes  What?  It's all just random stuff  Random shit where like a father would be tying his kid's shoelace  And the kid laughs  And the father's like  Oh what are you laughing?  And he goes  The man behind you  Oh yeah  That's like ghost shit  There's so much of that shit going on  There's a story about a kid on a couch  And I think it's a little girl  And she's waving her hands up and down like this  And the mom asks  What are you doing?  She goes  I'm just imagining what blood feels like rushing over me  There's like these stories  And it was at night  I had to stop reading it  Until the next day 
[01:23:30]  It was too scary  Yeah  Because there are people that really believe that kids can see shit we can't see  Because they're still innocent  It's so scary  And I don't know man  I don't want  I don't want  To go down this road  Because I don't want my kid like focusing on something behind me  And then I have to ask him what he's doing  And then it's some horror  You know  It's so scary  Is that the page?  I think so  Alright can we do it after the break?  Yes yes  I got a leak  I got to eat  Could you print that out?  Yeah  And give me a copy of it  And we'll go over it  Dude they're so fucking scary 
[01:24:00]  It's like a fucking horror movie going on in people's houses  And what?  It's one guy?  No it's a bunch of stories that these kids have said to their parents  But how do we know this is real and not some guy just  Well you don't  But it's just  It's something that you could absolutely see happening  Well you know what  But now we got  This is the cool thing about the radio show  Now we're going to have the parents call  We've done this break before  Yeah  We have?  Well we've done the  Yeah we've done the break where parents will  You'll see  We're going to do it again 
[01:24:30]  Where parents talk about how their kids  Are seeing their dead fucking relatives  It's so creepy  It's so creepy  Who are you talking to?  I remember one guy calling and saying  I asked my daughter  Who are you talking to?  And she said  Grandma  And Grandma  And Grandma never was alive when this kid  Oh Jesus  You know  Before this kid was born  So scary  So we'll get into that  Yeah  Some other things  Is Guy Fieri cooking for us today?  He's bringing food over  Oh boy  From his joint  I think so  It's good food but I can't eat it  It's too unhealthy

[01:29:30]  coming to Sirius XM  something new to wake up to  it's Scott and Don in the morning  radio titan Scott Shannon and Don Imus  come together and start your day off  with a bigger boost than a double shot of espresso.  Who were our guests today, John Imus?  Oh, my God.  We're starting to talk about the upcoming election.  Well, Lloyd, don't think we all... 
[01:30:00]  Scott and Don, don't just talk politics.  Wherever these two guys go, comedy is sure to follow.  We should do some more comedy, bitch.  Do you do song parodies?  I used to do song parodies back in the day.  I don't do much anymore.  I ain't in trouble too much.  And watch out, because Scott and Don aren't afraid to get a little edgy.  I ain't in trouble too much.  I'm not going to be in it at all.  What is it?  I'm not going to be in it at all.  Scott and Don in the morning. 
[01:30:30]  Finally, radio gets a breath of fresh air.  The OPNC Show.  Consumption.  I bet he puts his hands through his hair at that part. 
[01:31:00]  Well, I don't even care.  Because I can see what's going on.  It's hip to be square.  It's hip to be square.  And I bet his dancers are dancing a lot.  And they're wearing like nerdy glasses.  Yeah.  Pocket protectors.  And they're all doing a little nerdy dance around Greg.  There's an audience for that show, no? 
[01:31:30]  Of course.  Right there in Branson.  What kind of voice does he have?  You know a little bit about vocals.  This is a lounge act kind of a...  This is a cruise ship show.  Cruise ship show.  Yes.  Is it bad?  I don't even know if it's bad.  Well, of course I know it's bad.  But I can't say it's bad.  We're friends.  But like you said, there is an audience for it.  If this was on a cruise ship that I was on, I would so go see it.  Yeah, because you're in that frame of mind. 
[01:32:00]  When you're on a cruise ship...  I've only been on a cruise ship once.  But yeah...  But you're in that frame of mind like everything's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you saw this in Times Square right now, you'd walk right past it.  Yeah, absolutely.  I guess you've got to be in the mood in the right place.  This is the big dance part.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're being square.  Oh, just because you've got to write that royalty check off to fucking... 
[01:32:30]  They're out in the audience dancing.  Oh, no!  In the aisles.  Imagine that one of the guys comes up to you and wants to like fucking pull you out and dance.  This is the part where he runs back to the stage to grab the mic.  Yeah, yeah.  Makes it to some time.  It's not too hard to figure out.  Woo!  You see it every day.  Oh, yeah.  Those that were the father's...  How is Barry dressed?  He's got to be square, though, too.  But he's got to be like, cool square. 
[01:33:00]  He wears Neroom jackets.  Big corn room glasses.  And then he throws them off.  He's hip to be square.  Good old Barry.  I'm going to call him back and make sure he's cool.  Oh, no.  Please don't.  No?  Please don't.  I think you should.  You think?  It was bad enough in the car.  I believe there should be a phone call.  Were you getting all cringy knowing that phone was ringing?  I was completely uncomfortable.  So was I.  You might have to sit here and make believe it wasn't.  You should check in at every hour.  Just call and say, I just wanted to make sure you're not mad at me. 
[01:33:30]  But that makes him mad.  What?  That would make him mad, you think?  It's an obnoxious, girly thing to do.  It's only like seven still.  He's probably...  He gets up late.  Let's see if he calls somebody else.  He's got a show to do in Branson.  I wonder how many shows he does.  This is the part where they're all dancing, but the horn section comes out front.  So do go back and forth.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Greg dances with him a little.  Greg.  You want to call Bob Saget and wish him a happy birthday?  It's Bob Saget. 
[01:34:00]  It's Bob Saget.  I got his phone number.  It's his birthday.  Man, I got his phone number.  He'd probably be upset if he didn't call him.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Stop the presses.  Oh, he brought some gifts.  Oh, I brought some Magnolia Bakery.  Holland.  Did he really?  Well, I don't know.  Very nice, Colin Quinn.  Colin's a gentleman.  Yeah, that's just like my Paul Anka gift.  What?  Can you believe that?  Yup.  Can you believe Paul Anka?  We never discussed the Paul Anka situation, did we?  No. 
[01:34:30]  Not really.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  Colin's got an issue.  I forgot.  I don't want to touch any of my Magnolia Bakery gifts.  Magnolia Bakery.  It's lies what they say.  The Paul Anka thing with Colin Quinn gets way worse because now I got a gift from the man.  Unbelievable.  Colin Quinn, for the people that don't know, was on hold.  And I'm not even going to lie.  Like, we would take Colin's call every single fucking time.  Me and Jim Norton panicked that day.  And we wanted everything perfect for the Paul Anka interview because we heard the tapes. 
[01:35:00]  Of course.  He gets, like, maniacal.  We thought, you know, we could be in a world of hurt if things weren't, you know, working out quite right.  Yes.  So, we blew off Colin Quinn.  Yeah.  And he has never let it go, by the way.  It was only a couple of months ago, for Christ's sake.  We never let it go.  Second of all, I like the fact you guys have MMA guys in here every day.  You bust their chops.  But Paul Anka, we didn't want to.  We and Jim were panicking.  He's a fucking...  Who's Paul Anka?  Who gives a damn?  Paul Anka's a legend.  Shut up.  He's old school. 
[01:35:30]  He's like Vegas Mafia when, you know, they really got things done.  Exactly.  That's the operative term.  When.  Yeah, but you don't know if he still knows some of those guys.  He still doesn't have the heat.  Now.  They tried to blow up his car like Lefty Rosenthal.  And he was out.  But I got a gift from Paul Anka with a nice note.  What is it?  And he uses my real name, Colin Quinn.  It's like a whiskey decanter and some glasses.  Crystal.  Crystal.  The decanter alone is about 100 and 100 and a half online.  Yeah, that'll go in the cupboard for the next 30 years. 
[01:36:00]  That's what I said.  It's one of those wedding gifts you never actually use, but looks nice.  But now Paul Anka's showing up next week again.  Oh my God.  He enjoyed himself so much that he wants to come on again.  And Ovi was going to re-gift that for a wedding.  Give it to him.  I'm going to a wedding in Philly.  How great would this be?  Now, you know old school, Colin.  Paul Anka would expect now, if he comes in here, to have that filled with whiskey.  And you now serve him some on his inner can.  Man, you don't just fucking...  That's the expectation of the old school guy. 
[01:36:30]  You know what?  I don't want to be corny.  This feels right in a way that Jim here in the third seat never did.  I saw a few of the little Twitter battles that were going on.  Can I read the Paul Anka note?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, please.  What a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it and look forward to the next time.  With much respect.  Ah, they love respect.  Handwritten note, by the way.  Yeah.  You don't see those anymore.  No assistant. 
[01:37:00]  Huh?  No, that's Paul Anka.  This is old school.  That's an autographed card.  Yeah.  Of course he enjoyed the morning, because I was sitting there on hold.  And then they go to me...  Sorry, I thought Lady Gaga was in.  Oh, really?  No, because they go, look, can you call back?  They have to leave me on hold for eight minutes.  Paul Anka's here.  I was like, yeah, I guess.  Click.  Oh, wow.  I didn't do the click.  Oh, wow.  We panicked, Colin.  We did panic.  Wow.  We know it wasn't right, but we did panic.  It's disrespected me so much in the past three months, I can't even... 
[01:37:30]  I don't know where to start.  Anthony, you were in here one day.  Him and Bill Burr.  I was so mad.  I can't even explain.  Who was in that day that we panicked?  Oh, it was...  Because here's what...  Mark Cuban.  Mark Cuban comes in.  Who I knew before that.  I was in that day.  By the way, I thought we worked this out.  I remember that.  You were relegated to the couch.  Right.  Yes.  I was relegated.  I go, hey, let me go sit at the couch trying to be nice.  But then I realized the psychology.  When you put yourself to the couch, people treat you like that.  Yes.  You're now the couch person.  Right, right, right.  So then these two dummies start trashing me in front of Mark Cuban. 
[01:38:00]  I feel like it should be all of us against whoever the guest is.  Yeah, you're right.  Well, Bill Burr certainly had no business jumping in.  And then Mark Cuban, like any human being sensing blood like a chicken pecking party,  starts trying to attack me, too.  Then I trashed stupid Shark Tank.  Then he gets, no more than me.  Shut up.  But what bugs me before that, I knew Mark Cuban.  I had met him twice.  We got a little great.  So in the back of my mind, I was like, hey, you know what? 
[01:38:30]  If push ever comes to shove, I go for a couple of Bill to Mark Cuban.  I go on the street for a couple of million.  And now that's ruined for life.  Because I left.  Oh, but how did I leave?  We all just looked at each other scowling, and I just left.  Colin was mad, for real.  I was so mad.  I mean, I had to talk it out with Colin.  Because I was in the wrong.  I'll admit it.  I was in the wrong.  I took a weird shot at Colin, but I didn't mean anything by it.  But it came across weird.  So that day ended, and Colin left mad, for real. 
[01:39:00]  And it was right before the Patrice O'Neal benefit.  Well, you know what?  So we had to work it out, right, Colin?  Yeah, we worked it out.  Because I didn't mean that.  And you know that.  I'll never speak to you again.  Yeah.  Except in the rear naked chokehold.  Colin's biting his finger.  Very angry.  We've been doing this a very long time.  But the one thing that we're still a little, like, shaky about is when guests come in,  we do change our persona sometimes.  It's really...  I don't know why we do that. 
[01:39:30]  Horrendous.  Corny.  It's corny.  Corny.  But we do.  It's corny.  We've become gentlemen or something.  It's ridiculous.  And once again, the stand, it could be Paul Anka, Monk.  It doesn't matter who it is.  As long as they say, I'm a guest, suddenly all things are true.  That is true.  We ought to fucking...  I mean, we do...  I don't want to ruin this for Guy Fieri.  He comes in all happy.  I go, hey.  Fuck that guy.  No, we kill him.  We kill Guy.  It's a level of celebrity that we become gentlemen.  We do a good job with them, but I don't know. 
[01:40:00]  Sometimes I'm like, man, I'm not acting like me right now.  Yeah.  I know.  And the most annoying, it goes without saying, is Norton, who somehow besides...  His IQ goes up when a guest comes in.  And it doesn't.  Everybody knows it doesn't.  Last week, I was here.  Aw.  Can I quote last week?  Yes, please.  When I was here when the MTV people were here.  Yeah, Alan Hunt, Martha, all of them, they read a book.  First of all, he looks at the book two minutes before they come in and then tries to act like  he read the whole thing when they come in. 
[01:40:30]  Now, first of all, the book is reading it.  You know, a lot of these books, that's how he does it.  He trashes the other thing that doesn't exist.  And I was like, what?  A lot of these books, you can't read them.  But this book is great.  Oh, that's very incisive.  Well, he snuck in the thesaurus for that one.  I mean, in this book, you can just read short stories and it goes, shut up.  Shut up.  You don't appreciate how he jumped in there and tried to talk the book up. 
[01:41:00]  It's so nauseating.  Can you see what kind of magnolia you bought?  Did you go red velvet?  Where did you go?  No.  I put some muffins and stuff.  Oh, you got muffins?  Nice.  Muffins.  This will be good.  Then Guy Fieri comes in.  He has a couple of stories about the magnolia bakery.  Oh, probably, yeah.  Kicks us off for a nice half hour.  You're ready?  We go, Colin, it's a good thing you brought these.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know they were in the muffin business.  What flavor are those?  There are all kinds of flavors.  Cappuccino, blueberry.  Oh, my God.  I'm a big fan of the blueberry.  What is that?  Oh, let's have a piece of pie with salmon. 
[01:41:30]  That's amazing.  Because of what he did to scorch.  He tried to do, apparently, this is on Twitter.  Apparently, he tried to do to me what he did to scorch yesterday.  Sell you out and fucking.  Right down the river.  Trash my comedy on his radio, Al.  What did you do?  I didn't even mention Colin.  I was talking about the fact that people on Twitter like to start trouble.  Right.  And so then everybody on Twitter just started picking fights between me and everybody.  Oh, what is that?  Somebody said I was trashing Colin.  Somebody said I was trashing Norton.  Somebody said I was trashing Ellis.  Right. 
[01:42:00]  What are those?  Sugar muffin.  I don't know.  What the fuck is a sugar muffin?  I don't know, but I'm calling Colin that forever now.  You're my little sugar muffin.  It's better than that blueberry eating odd walk that comes in here.  Colin, I got to tell you, I know you get uncomfortable when people talk about you, but I went to  your show last night.  Did you know I was even there?  No, I got you text.  I mean, I got you tweet.  Yeah.  And, uh, well, I didn't want to be a bother.  And this is how much I like you.  I went by myself knowing it was a couple's thing. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  Because I couldn't find anyone to go with.  Everyone shut me down.  My wife shut me down.  Sam Roberts shut me down.  What?  E-Rock shut me down.  What?  And Roland shut me down.  So I show up by myself awkwardly while...  The unkindest cut of all.  Bob Kelly's there with his wife.  Tom Popp is there with his wife.  Keith Robinson was by himself.  Yeah, but...  In a section.  I mean...  Yeah.  Be honest.  That section Keith was in.  That was a weird section, right?  It was a section...  The dog pound?  Keith has not been in that section literally since 1952.  I believe it was outlawed. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  And, uh, Seinfeld was there.  Your pal.  Uh-huh.  And I think at this point you hate when people bring up the fact that you're friends with  Seinfeld, but you are.  He supports everything you do.  And, uh, I made sure I didn't go up to Seinfeld.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I knew he wouldn't appreciate that.  And didn't put Tom Popp in a bad position.  No, because...  Did you hear what happened?  No.  So I'm waiting for my tickets.  Seinfeld walks in, recognizes Tom Popp, goes right up to...  And they're like, buddy, buddy.  And then I see Tom Popp's eyes, because I saw Tom Popp as well. 
[01:43:30]  And he saw me, and he was happy I was there.  But I could see the panic in his face, like, please don't come over, because I don't want  to be in the position of introducing you to Seinfeld.  Horror.  I could tell.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I understand it.  I've been in the weird...  I love the fact that you picked up the horror and fear of eyes.  Oh, don't do this.  Don't do this.  Because he's thinking, oh my God, he's going to come up and say hi to me, and then I have  to introduce him to Seinfeld.  And then...  Knowing Seinfeld wouldn't give a fuck.  Tom would have to reclimb that Seinfeld pyramid, because you'd have knocked him down so low. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, let me get this out of the way.  Jerry seems like a difficult person to be friends with.  Yeah.  It just seems like, you know...  That says a lot.  Like, you're being judged every second of how you interact with him, or, you know, you  can't just bring someone up and go, Jerry, I'd like you to meet.  You know, that's crazy.  Yeah.  I was just happy.  I was invited to the same function as the likes of Jerry Seinfeld. 
[01:44:30]  That is pretty good.  Anyway.  Yeah, because we met Jerry one time.  His agent was with, or knew an agent that we were with, and out in front of a restaurant.  So we're like, oh, and Jerry, this is, you know, Opie and Anthony from the Rage.  He literally looked at us for a second and went like, oh.  That's exactly what he gave us.  Oh.  And then turned his head back around.  It was just...  It was just, no, I...  And then I met him at the roast they did for you back in the day.  Right.  And that was when Comedian was out. 
[01:45:00]  So I actually went on stage afterwards when everyone was just milling and about, and I  was right next to him, and I actually said, hey, man, just wanted to let you know,  I really liked that new documentary, Digging a Lot.  He goes, oh, thanks.  Thank you.  And then turned back around, and I'm just standing there like...  Well, I can't imagine you guys putting forth an energy like, hey, we're your equal, because  you guys grobbled in the face of Paul Anker.  Oh!  Oh!  So when you see Jerry, you must be blown.  Handwritten note.  Oh, that's cool.  We were saying earlier that, you know, he was part of the Rat Pack with Sammy and Frank 
[01:45:30]  and...  Dean.  And Dean, and now his Rat Pack is Opie, Comia, and Norton.  Oh, God.  Kind of a drop-off, don't you think?  He's probably happy, yeah.  How the mighty...  Anyway, Unconstitutional is fantastic, Colin.  How'd you feel last night?  I felt good.  Yeah.  I felt good just to get it up, you know?  Like I said, the early days, the only ones that came to see it was...  A year ago on Long Island, it was Anthony Comia.  Oh, yeah.  And the biggest insult was, Roland lived 40 feet away.  40 feet away from the club.  And every day, he would tell me... 
[01:46:00]  I ran into him in the street.  That was the time he skulked away from me.  Remember when I was trying to say hello to Roland?  Yeah, sure.  And he just gulked.  And he just gave me the old Robanga, like...  Yeah.  Oh, so that's why you were in Long Island City.  Oh, yeah.  You were working on this show that's now...  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  ...happening.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Oh, that's awesome.  Just amazing.  Because this is going to follow the same path as your last show.  You're going to do the Barrow Street for a while, and then they're going to move it  uptown for you.  I know it.  No, I'm not...  Oh, really?  I'm done with this show.  Why?  No, maybe I'll do it, but I mean...  One-off.  No, you're not telling this one.  One-off.  This one's got legs. 
[01:46:30]  I'm working on...  Thanks, but I'm working on something else, too.  I'm working on another project.  I know I sound like the third banana that usually sits here.  Me and him have an unnerving amount in common.  We're both working on these projects bitterly.  We've been going to get made for a long time.  And Danny Aiello was there last night.  Yeah, I love Danny Aiello.  And I was enjoying my time, but I'm like, you know what?  Let me see if Danny Aiello's enjoying his time.  So I was watching him for a while, laughing his ass off. 
[01:47:00]  Danny Aie.  Danny Aie.  He probably knows Paul Anka, too.  Probably.  A couple of fellow fucking...  Danny Aie looking real good.  Yeah.  Real good.  Yeah.  He's a little knockout artist.  I just have a friend from the Bronx that said Danny was the coach at Clinton High School  Football, and he said he was...  When he was playing there, this kid Hector, and he said that Danny was just like...  Anytime there's a problem, you run out in the field, you start dropping people.  Really?  He had a great right hand.  What a maniac.  Like anytime I had static with another Bronx high school.  Right, right.  Imagine Bronx football in the 70s. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  He's like a wanderer.  Yeah, no kidding.  No shit, man.  I ain't talking to you.  I like that he has that in him.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Do you ever know the little girl from the Wanderers that played Terror's girlfriend?  Yeah, yeah.  She grew up to be...  Her name was Storker Patty.  I ain't talking to you.  I ain't talking to Tara.  Talking to you.  Oh, Tara.  They're going to send you up to Vietnam.  Tara.  That's all you got on your show last night?  You felt good? 
[01:48:00]  Well, I think Patty should be there.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it was like...  The jokes are strong.  I told Ann one of the jokes I had to.  Because everyone has that angle on the Second Amendment and the founding fathers and your  line about it.  About when they put that in place, 42% of the country was bears.  What a fucking great line.  Of course, Colin delivers it perfectly.  Of course.  And got a huge response.  I deliver with an anchor-like person.  Yes.  How long is it... 
[01:48:30]  Well, anchor, I never thought about that.  His name is anchor.  Oh.  Anchor.  Yeah.  It's like you're saying anchor.  Like a New Yorker saying anchor.  Yeah.  Anchor.  Oh, anchor, yeah.  He's the anchor of the whole thing.  Yeah, I bet he has amazing stories.  I would have blown me off, too.  Don't get me wrong.  Yeah.  How many weeks are you down at the Barrow Street?  Just until June 3rd.  That's it?  Yeah.  Do you really have...  Do you don't have plans after that?  No.  Because we put it up.  Like, that place just opened up, and I liked it because it looked like the Constitution  Hall.  It was kind of creepy how that worked out for us.  Right?  I was talking to someone after the show.  They said that's a set from a show that just failed quickly. 
[01:49:00]  It was a set from a show that was up called Stonewall about the gay liberation riots  of 1969.  Right.  Oh, gee.  You know what I mean?  How could that not go over?  It was perfect.  Oh, exactly.  The Village.  Sounds great.  Sounds like a laugh riot.  That was Chelsea.  Right, right.  It's still...  The Village is all, like, rich.  I mean...  So Colin moves in.  Paul Anka was on the mic, I heard.  Really?  He actually got on the mic when he talked.  Put your head on my shoulder.  So Colin walks in and goes, fuck it, we're using this set. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  And it works, though.  Yeah, for some reason it worked.  Yeah.  You going up the stairs to make a point over there, then you come back down over here.  Yeah.  Talking to the audience a little bit.  Talk here, you talk to here.  But it's scary.  You know, I'm so used to the people I know in the audience that it doesn't bother me like  everybody else.  Right.  But, like, I knew literally 60% of that audience.  It's a little weird, you know?  Yeah, that's what I was thinking for.  It's like getting up to make a speech at, like, a party or something.  Now, do you consider yourself, now that you've done this, do you consider yourself an expert  at the Constitution? 
[01:50:00]  No, yeah, I do.  I do.  I consider myself...  Dedicated.  I consider myself understanding the core.  Right.  Rather than just the outsides of it.  Okay.  So, you know...  I'm not an expert about the detail, but I understand...  I feel like I understand the philosophy of it.  The principle and philosophy of it.  Yes.  Because a lot of people can pick an amendment and run with it and be like, all right.  He's got it all figured out.  But they don't know really...  And you know what, Anthony?  I have nothing but respect for those people, too.  Of course you do, Carl.  I felt proud because of a few of the jokes I knew because you tried them out on our show. 
[01:50:30]  See?  I'm like, that son of a bitch tried that joke out on our show.  Nice.  And now it's in his one-man show.  How about my joke yesterday about E-Roc giving me the stink eye every time I'm in here?  He does?  On Twitter.  Well, obviously something's going on because Travis is in his spot right now.  Oh, shit.  Either he doesn't like looking at you or he's taking a giant shit that he does every day.  Why do you want this job, Travis?  Can't sleep?  Does he really give you a stink eye?  No.  Oh, one other thing. 
[01:51:00]  He just naturally has a stink eye, I think.  One other thing.  I'm not feeling social after your show last night.  Unconstitutional.  And I want to sneak out.  And the after party's at the same place.  Oh, boy.  They put everyone on the street so they could set up some pizza and shit.  They got some pizza.  It was casual.  No, I know it was casual.  Whatever.  So I'm trying to sneak out.  I'm like, I got to get up early.  And I'm doing really, really well.  I get to the crowd.  No one's noticing.  And I'm now out of the theater, sneaking down the street.  And all of a sudden I hear, hey, where you going, lonely? 
[01:51:30]  Bob Kelly.  Of course.  Blows up my spot.  Of course.  So then I have to go over there and do some small talk about how he's going to be a father soon.  That's all you can talk to Bob about now.  I was going to say, you should have just done the old show tomorrow.  Right.  You tap the imaginary watch on your wrist.  But he yelled it.  And then you go, out of here.  You're shocked at Bob.  And then I go over there and he touches me.  And I jump.  And he goes, what's wrong?  Was molested?  I'm like, maybe I just don't want you touching me like that. 
[01:52:00]  It doesn't mean I was molested.  This sounds like a great time you two had last night.  Holy shit.  What the fuck is going on between you two?  I've never touched Anthony.  I've known him for fucking 19 years.  We don't touch.  We're the untouchables.  I think we did a couple fists.  Did we ever do a fake hug?  We don't have a touch hug.  Up the ass.  Did we ever hug?  No, I don't think so.  Not even the handshake hug?  That's accepted?  No, no.  I think it's, yeah.  Not even the Huntington hug?  I don't know what it is, but I like that.  The shrug? 
[01:52:30]  The shrug.  I always thought Opie was from, didn't you tell me you were from Centiport at one point?  I am, yeah.  I mean, that's just, of course you don't hug at me.  You didn't see anybody until he was like 18 years old.  No.  It's true.  There's nobody.  You take one.  Take one 11 straight shot.  Yeah.  Straight.  It's a straight shot.  One 10 actually.  One 10.  One 10 straight shot.  Not that little highway, that highway buddy.  Nah.  It was a little clamming community.  Yes.  A lot of my friends would, that's how they made their summer money.  And their fathers would make an extra garage and turn it into a clamming, a clam freezer. 
[01:53:00]  They look like they're in that fucking little canoe out there, pumping the fucking clamming  thing.  And then they just, they would go to the bars afterwards, and of course I would be there,  and they would just stink.  Like fucking clams.  It was either.  Fish.  Why would you?  Go get home.  Go take a shower at home.  Take a shower.  My little hometown of Centiport, it was either go and find some clams or go caddy at the Huntington  Crescent Club.  Yeah.  That was pretty much it.  No other work available?  Not really, man.  I worked a clam rake a few times. 
[01:53:30]  That's rough.  A clam rake.  That is rough.  I don't even want to know what the clam rake is.  That's terrible.  The clam rake's like 20, 30 feet long, and you fucking dig it.  It's got like handlebars on the end.  It's got like hooks and a basket on the other end.  And you gotta move it back and forth and try to get clams.  In the water?  Yeah.  Navy SEAL training.  You're right.  Yes.  It's tough work.  It's not easy.  Oh, Jesus.  Drill sergeants dumping sand down your back while you're trying to fucking do it.  Right.  It's terrible.  How many hours did you do that?  That was like 16 hours. 
[01:54:00]  I went out here and they were my friends and they would just, you know, fool around with  it a little bit.  I don't think they were actually on the job.  The real guys would be out there all the time.  Whenever.  They're not moving.  It's not like fishing.  You think clams have hours?  It's like lobster.  You think clams have hours where they're like, oh, look at the time.  Right.  I haven't woken up yet.  I'm still drowsy.  I don't like Sam's new, like, pleasant, medicated outlook.  No?  Please.  Sam doesn't laugh at anything.  But then when he does laugh, he'll give you a lot and he'll start crying. 
[01:54:30]  He used to have to laugh.  He used to feel like he had to laugh.  Yeah.  He could be in and get what he wants.  Now that he's getting a little more notoriety here at CSXM Saturday Radio.  He's, yeah, he's just like, when he sits there and he's not laughing or talking, all  he's thinking about is how could I use this moment to further my own shit and my own career.  That sounds right.  Yeah.  When he sits here, you think he's looking at you two.  No.  All he sees is skeletons.  Yes.  He's just waiting.  He is waiting.  And by the way, when you said that, who the fuck was Mr. Australian guy that was saying 
[01:55:00]  shit about you?  Jason Ellis.  Jason Ellis said some shit about you.  You talked about this on yesterday's after show.  Wait, what did he say?  He was saying shit.  Is he acting up again?  What's wrong with this guy?  Yes.  Because Sam all of a sudden goes like.  Why does he act up like this shit?  He's like, no, I considered it a compliment.  It's like, no, he shit on you.  What did he say?  He said he didn't like me.  Got the clip.  Can somebody be clearer than that?  Jason, very light.  Jason doesn't like you or our audience. 
[01:55:30]  Hang on.  I actually may have the clip.  It is an insult.  And then he used this passive aggressive shit to try not to, I don't know, to try to  get himself out of a jam that he knew he'd be in.  I have no problem.  I really don't fancy you, Sam.  No.  I said we'd go to the wall.  Okay.  I have no problems with Jason Ellis, but I can't figure him out sometimes.  That's how I'll find him.  I don't understand the 40-year-old extreme guy anymore.  I just, it's like fucking Troy Kwan and his skateboard.  You're fucking 40 and you're tweeting pictures and you want a longboard. 
[01:56:00]  I'll go to war if you think I was being optimistic about the whole thing.  We should go to war.  All right.  You want me to play the clip?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's hear the clip.  You tell me, Ope, what do you think if somebody said this about you?  I felt pissed off because, you know, I consider you like, you know, a little brother.  Okay.  Not my brother, like a black person.  Like a small black person.  Colin, you can decide to.  Yeah.  Well, let's get Colin involved.  He is third black today.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  I am, yeah.  Okay, here we go. 
[01:56:30]  It feels right.  It sucks.  They have this other dude.  I don't think he likes me.  I don't really like him either, actually.  I guess I should get over that.  Oh, that one Sam dude.  I stopped it there because that was like, you know my name.  Like when he was like, that one like Sam dude.  And that is kind of a.  Yeah, but you're hard to figure out sometimes.  Why?  I'm going to defend Jason so far.  Why do you mean I'm hard to figure out?  So far, all he said is I don't like him.  Yeah, I don't like him.  Colin is killing it and you haven't laughed yet. 
[01:57:00]  I smiled at him.  Yeah.  Did he give you a smile, Colin?  He did.  He gave me like a bland, kind of a nurse ratchet smile.  Just one corner of the mouth going up?  Like this.  Yeah, I think Sam's on medication.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm not saying.  He's on Wellbutrin.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but sometimes you're hard to figure out.  That's all.  Okay.  Where your emotions are coming from.  I don't think so.  You're giving him much too much credit.  Yes.  Thank you.  He's not that deep.  All right, let's listen to him more.  He's an enigma.  Or at least half.  Well.  All right.  I don't really like him either, actually. 
[01:57:30]  I guess I should get over that.  But that one Sam dude, he sounds annoying to me or something, but he fucking tries.  He's one of those people, again, that whether he's your style or not, he fucking gives a  shit about radio.  It's always a weird thing for me to like people that are similar to me at my game.  So like, you know, Jake Ellberg says he doesn't like people.  See, you got hung up on the part where he goes, hey, he's trying and I can't like him  because it's similar. 
[01:58:00]  All he's doing is complimenting himself.  Look what he said.  Sam, he tries hard.  He tries hard.  I have such a hard time liking people that are like me.  What he means is, I try so hard at this.  But he's not trashing him, really, at that point.  He's using him to make himself look better.  Oh, okay.  And he did trash him.  And he said I was annoying.  Yes.  Which I'm not.  You know, but I respect a guy that tries hard.  He didn't say you succeed at it.  He didn't say you're good.  He said you're annoying.  And it's certainly not your place to decide you're not annoying. 
[01:58:30]  We'll make that joke.  Right.  Exactly.  Which I'm not.  He says that nobody answers.  It was like a giant silence when he said, which I'm not.  We'll decide here.  The only compliment.  Nobody said, no, you're not.  The only compliment is that he's like me.  He's trying hard.  But you're like the Special Olympics kid.  They try hard, but really.  Yeah, I don't need an A for effort.  Exactly.  He gave you an A for effort.  Gee, thanks.  I don't need that.  Or that other crazy expression, an E for effort. 
[01:59:00]  Stupid.  Sam.  Anyway.  A for effort.  You can say A for effort.  Shut up.  You say what I tell you to say.  You're right.  I'm a constitutional expert.  Yes, he is.  I know constitutional law.  Law.  I know constitutional law.  Yes.  Excuse me.  Sam, you fucked up the Paul Anker gift as well.  Whoa.  I didn't even do anything with it.  You looked it up.  I've been telling people it's a little over 100 bills.  I just got a quote here.  $600 for the Crystal Decanter alone.  Stop it.  It's not.  It's $100. 
[01:59:30]  We looked it up.  Travis and I both looked it up.  You would have gave Paul a thank you worth $100.  It was $600.  That's where you screwed up.  It's $100.  We both looked it up.  It's six large.  It's six large.  Look.  There it is.  Paul doesn't give out $100.  That's nothing to have.  That's the same thing.  Where?  At a fucking Times Square electronics store?  Please.  Yeah.  I'm going with $600.  It's $100.  Run by a Tel Aviv cartel.  I went to buy a Cat 5 cable.  A three foot long Cat 5 cable out there.  He wanted $35.  I swear to you. 
[02:00:00]  I started laughing.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  And then I go to walk.  I literally yelled at him, get the fuck out of here.  I go to walk out and he goes, my friend, my friend.  Okay.  I can do $20.  I'm like, get it.  I can do $20.  This is a fucking $2 thing item.  Is it really $2?  I wouldn't even know.  Actually, you don't even have to pay for it.  Everyone has them in their house somewhere.  In a drawer coiled up.  I was in the city.  And he goes, I go to the fucking PC Richards on Old Country Road.  Old Country Road. 
[02:00:30]  I'm right there by the mall in Mineola, you fuck.  I'm in Garden City.  It's my favorite thing, Colin.  You fucking low life.  Colin knows two things.  The Constitution and Long Island.  Look out, Brad.  He knows Long Island.  He really knows it.  Oh, yeah.  I go to the fucking Green Acres Mall, you cocksucker.  It's his next fucking show he's going to do.  It's going to be called Long Island.  You just get on stage.  You go, hey, guys.  Long Island, you cocksuckers.  That's the name of the show.  Let's talk about Hop Hog.  Named after the Indians.  And then they put, like, the Hop Hog-ian Indians up on the screen. 
[02:01:00]  Colin goes to town.  I go halfway through the crisis.  Totally.  And I go, now Holbrook.  Now, wait a minute.  This is actually very interesting.  Trying to get back with Holbrook.  Let's talk about the Levithousers in Levittown.  You know, after the war.  But I told you, I was out there.  I worked on this Constitution show in Roncon.  I was doing, you know, McGuire's in Ronconcoma.  Oh, right, yeah.  Which I call the Conk now.  And they've taken on, you know.  The Conk.  Before that, they were calling it Ronco or something.  I said, it's got to be called the Conk.  The Conk is good. 
[02:01:30]  And that's catching up.  Ronconcoma.  I really grew to love Ronconcoma.  I see bumper stickers.  The Conk.  The Conk.  Suck My Conk.  That'd be a good one, too.  You grew to love Ronconcoma?  Yes.  Did you have a place by the lake to type on the old typewriter?  To type it like fucking Hemingway.  Like a poor man's Hemingway.  He's in Lake Ronconcoma.  Lake Ronconcoma.  In a shack.  Clacking away on his typewriter.  One of those summer shacks.  How great would that be? 
[02:02:00]  If you had this artist, this guy trying to write this intellectual book,  like he thinks like the hampers, but he's in Lake Ronconcoma.  And he starts writing about like some deep, great guy speaking.  He hasn't written about these dirt bags.  Dirt bags.  He's constantly interrupted by the Suffolk County police rousting the indigenous people  of Ronconcoma.  It's changed a little bit.  It's changed a tad.  From its glory days.  Oh, do I love it.  By the way, Sam keeps track.  E-Rock, not me.  Sam has just written, E-Rock was gone for over 15 minutes in the bathroom. 
[02:02:30]  E-Rock.  He just got back.  15 minutes for a dump?  It happens.  It was one of those giant E-Rock dumps.  Nice.  What did you eat last night, E-Rock?  I had a Cobb salad for dinner.  A Cobb salad?  Yeah.  I love those.  I love it.  I don't think I've ever had one.  I've heard about them.  Grilled chicken.  Hardcore leg.  Shut up, E-Rock.  We know it's in a Cobb salad.  Blob salad.  All right.  We're going back to the Jason Ellis thing.  So far, not bad.  Not bad.  I say so far, so bad.  It's passive-aggressive. 
[02:03:00]  It's very passive-aggressive.  It's not right out there in your face bad.  You don't expect a passive-aggressive Australian.  Right.  Yeah, they don't exist.  He's an anomaly.  Yeah.  Anomaly.  He's an anomaly.  And the fucking annoying voice up at the end.  He's kind of annoying.  What, I know?  Yeah.  E-Rock, have a nice muffin.  Oh, there you go, E-Rock.  Best thing for you.  Yeah.  He fucking gives a shit about radio.  It's always a weird thing for me to like people that are similar.  To me at my game.  So, like, you know how Jake Ellenberger says he doesn't like people in his weight class? 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  It's kind of like that.  Like, I don't...  If you have too much in common with me on the radio and you want to excel in the business,  then I'm kind of very difficult to like you because that means you're trying to come  at me.  Right, right.  And I don't...  You're not coming at me.  I'm going to beat you.  More self-confidence.  Every time I'm going to beat you.  Congratulatory.  Self-congratulatory.  That is a clap.  So, you're saying...  I should be saying...  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Jason Ellis. 
[02:04:00]  Because not only are you not like me, I'm better than you.  Yes!  Thank you!  Yes.  I'm fucking new at this game.  Look at you.  You're fucking wet behind the ears, as they say.  And you're still fucking kicking some ass over here.  Yeah, you know, people are enjoying your little program.  Killing it.  Guess what?  Huh?  You shouldn't even be taking advice from these guys.  You have to go back to the original master who taught you.  That's true.  And find out how to deal with these kind of...  And find out how to deal with this kind of shit.  Scorch is taking shots at us.  Yes!  Oh, of course!  Scorch took some shots at us on Facebook last night. 
[02:04:30]  How dare he?  How dare he?  You've been having it for 10 years straight.  10 years and he finally fucking...  How dare he?  He finally pokes a jam out there.  Hoppy goes, Scorch is taking shots at us.  Like, I can't believe it.  How dare he?  How dare he?  Like, I can't believe it.  What a couple of assholes.  And I'm not even fucking acting.  Hoppy was genuinely outraged.  I can't believe he doesn't appreciate the hammering he's got for 10 years.  The hammering. 
[02:05:00]  What is he on Facebook?  He wrote a...  Yeah, here's his post on Facebook.  I just realized how the ONA fans posted...  Could you do it in the Scorch voice, please?  Yeah, I just realized how the ONA fans post up here.  Trying to prove that they're a much better and greater person than my listeners.  Yet, they come across as total idiots.  Since the average Joe doesn't even know who ONA are anymore.  Oh!  He went there.  He went there.  Scorch!  That is hardcore.  Scorch!  This should spot some fun ONA temp comebacks. 
[02:05:30]  Love you guys for your support.  Ah, there you go.  In the end, I have to say...  Oh, my God.  Proof himself so we can take the higher craft.  People, I'm not even going to hedge around this.  People, unleash hell.  No!  Go ahead.  Unleash hell.  Yes.  Go ahead.  No!  Yes.  Well, because he says no one knows who we are, so I think it's...  I think we have to show Scorch that people still know who we are, right?  Unleash hell.  Unleash the hounds of hell.  The hounds of fucking hell. 
[02:06:00]  I want to see fucking Maximus' dog slow-mo jump over that fiery log and fucking unleash  hell, people.  Was that not the best beginning of a movie?  That made that whole movie, that scene.  You know?  Those dogs.  Oh, yeah.  The dogs jumping...  The dogs of war.  That's what they always...  Exactly.  Yes.  I always thought it was like a metaphor, but it was...  I just thought it was a Pink Floyd song, right?  That's why I didn't know it came from somewhere.  I like a movie that fucking grabs you right from the beginning.  None of...  Before credits, before anything. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  You're like, this movie's great!  Right.  And then, you know, you're in it.  No matter...  It could tail off...  I was going to say, it tailed off a little, that movie.  Do you think it did?  Yes.  What parts didn't you like?  Everything after that.  Talk about a fucking 13-year-old movie.  After that.  Everything?  You didn't like the fucking...  The big Coliseum scenes?  Yeah, those were good.  I don't know.  But in between, it was like...  Yeah, but when you start off that strong, it's kind of tough to keep that up.  Those Huns in the woods.  Oh, the Huns.  It was crazy.  How about the casting just on those Huns alone?  That's great. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I liked the entire movie, sir.  I gotta be honest with you.  Yeah.  I thought it was just another...  You know, can't you make the guy like Maxie Minst not be the perfect...  How about this?  He cheated on his girlfriend.  How about it's not the one love of his life?  How about he cheated on her?  It was so...  You know what?  There was a fairytale-ish aspect to it there, Carl.  I don't like that kind of stuff.  You don't?  Well, when you're doing such authentic work in the rest of the movie...  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  And the CGI was amazing.  The Coliseum and everything.  It really pulled me right in.  I'm going to go this weekend and see that. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  It's a very old movie.  What do you see these days in the theaters, Colin?  What do you like?  I mean, there seems like there's a lot of good fare out there, but I haven't been to the  movies in a while myself, but that's not to denigrate the movie industry.  There's some fantastic fare.  A lot of good fare.  I just got a text message from Tom Papa.  Oh, what happened?  The drama continues from last night.  With the Jerry?  The big unconstitutional.  Uh-oh.  He writes...  Oh. 
[02:08:00]  Is he around?  He should come by today, too.  Yeah, tell Tom Papa.  I invite you as a third wheel, Tom, to stop in.  We can put him on the couch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get him on the couch.  We can all make fun of him.  No, Colin, you're never going on the couch again.  I'll go right on the couch when Tom comes in.  He just wrote, where are you running off to, Cinderella?  Oh.  See, I probably should have stuck around and been a little social.  Why?  You had to get up.  Were you social last night after the show?  Yeah, I didn't have to get up at 5 a.m. like you did.  Well, close.  You had to hear all those compliments?  Yeah, I just stood there, thank you, with a big smirk on my face. 
[02:08:30]  Colin, let me tell you something.  You got something here.  It's good.  And I'm like, guys, I don't know.  I guess people enjoy.  And meanwhile, you want to just say, yeah, I worked hard on it, and fucking night should be good.  I liked your curtain call, but we could still see him behind the door.  I know.  You had nowhere to go.  I'm the most unprofessional.  No, I could have done a little more effort, but I was like, oh.  He walks out, and there's a door, but we could still see him there, and he waits the appropriate amount of time, which would be three seconds. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, with my giant head in the door.  Yeah.  Did you bow?  Yes.  I'm telling you, it was great.  The stage fucking, yeah.  You don't need help selling tickets, right?  No.  Not that I know.  Meanwhile, the publicists are having a heart attack that I just, the fact that I just said that.  I know.  They're like, are you crazy?  Promote, promote.  Come on.  I think our listeners should go see it.  Absolutely.  I think they'd love it.  Yeah.  I think they would love it, too.  It's their kind of show, really.  Carl, how do you bring comedy to such a serious thing as the Constitution?  Exactly. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, he did.  Yeah.  All the listeners would love this show.  That's the most difficult.  It makes the Constitution easy to understand.  Yes.  And they don't know all the founding fathers.  Jason Ellis, one of the finest founding fathers.  You know, I look at John Hancock, I said, hey, he's a bloke, he's doing the same thing  I'm doing.  Right, you fucking kangaroo.  Can we take a break?  Why?  I gotta eat eggs.  Oh, you got some eggs, too.  I don't want to eat in front of people.  You looked over and you were like, that looks delicious.  Carl needs another cup of coffee, I do believe. 
[02:10:00]  Good.  I could use a V8.  You want a V8?  Yes.  A V8?  I like a good V8.  What is it, 1968?  In my mind, still yes.  Yes, it is, Carl.  We're going to talk about how I woke up Greg Brady a mere couple hours ago.  You missed that.  Oh, God.  Shit.  Right from Branson, Missouri, too.  He was not happy.  Barry wasn't happy?  No.  He's been on the show, right?  Yeah, but he's...  We used to be friends.  Woke him up at five in the morning in Branson.  So what?  That's the time everybody gets up in Branson.  Have you been there?  Oh, no. 
[02:10:30]  Everybody gets up at five.  Do they really?  People go to sleep at like eight o'clock in Branson.  I thought the shows were going on.  Yeah.  They started like six at night.  They started six.  Pierce Arrow.  Yes.  Everybody's like nine years old.  Yeah, Yakov is back now.  Since the Chechen situation, Yakov's ready to come back again.  I told you people, but nobody listened.  In my country, yes.  And we're going to read this creepy shit from kids.  I didn't forget.  Kids are fucked.  Kids talk.  And we're going to call Tom Popper on the break.  Yeah, let's talk.  Get him a call.  Get him down here. 
[02:11:00]  We should have Tom Popper in, I think.  Then we'll have two of Jerry's friends in the studio.  First of all.  Oh, forget it.  Oh, call what?  What?  Nothing.  Let's go.  Oh.  We got something fun to break there, E-Rock.  What do you got?  Anything good?  Nope.  Really?  He was shitting too long to set something up for the break.  Oh, that's too bad.  Yeah.  Great as shit.  Maybe we should play an E-Rock song then if E-Rock doesn't have anything.  Ah, every time he doesn't have anything.  Anytime he's not paying attention to the board.  Anytime he's helping Sal on the phones instead of being.  They already get something. 
[02:11:30]  We play an E-Rock song.  Do you know this little storyline?  No.  Colin would appreciate this.  Colin appreciates those weird storylines.  There's a guy that's obsessed with E-Rock and just makes songs about him.  Yeah.  A guy named Sean F.  And they're funny.  You'll learn.  He's got 10 E-Rock songs.  E-Rock, you'll learn after a while not to abandon your post when we play these songs.  I'll set them up like Pavlov's Hippopotamus.  Which one do you want to play today?  Be great.  Well, I feel like Colin should get to choose.  Colin, all right.  All right.  Read the titles for Colin.  You could...  Okay. 
[02:12:00]  Snacks.  There's a song called Snacks.  Right.  That's about E-Rock.  Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  The Fat E-Rock.  You're Fat as Fuck.  Pumped Up Tits.  That's a good one, yeah.  Sympathy for E-Rock.  Sympathy for E-Rock.  And Nagel and Bloom.  Sympathy for E-Rock.  That's the original one.  It's a good choice.  This is the original.  The original hit.  That started the whole thing.  Original hit.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a man of size and weight. 
[02:12:30]  Worked in radio for a long, long time.  But my skills are far from great.  Write fan fiction and I hate my job.  Cause they make fun of my shape.  He's about to sell it.  Watch.  Had to stay home after Sandy left.  Cause a branch blocked my escape.  I'm an asshole. 
[02:13:00]  Won't you guess my name?  Oh, yeah.  I'm an asshole.  I'm a known as sex bagels.  And I don't watch sports at all.  I bring nothing to the table.  I love garlic.  Butter sauce.  So if you see me, show some sympathy.  Cause I don't count calories. 
[02:13:30]  I shouted out, who broke the toilet seat?  When all the while, I knew it was me.  I'm an asshole.  Won't you guess my name?  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  Sean F.  I told you you would love it.  It's brilliant.  Why do you love it?  Cause it's just pitiless.  It's just...  Pitiless. 
[02:14:00]  Yes.  It hits the nail right on the head though.  Axel F.  I was going to say.  Just the pauses in between each line.  The discipline.  The cruelest thing you can do in this quiet, like, emotionless way.  And out of nowhere, I'm an asshole.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's really enjoyable.  Watching Kyle laugh.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  But we're not officially into break, so maybe we should play another one.  Unless E-Rock, you got something to play? 
[02:14:30]  E-Rock, you got something?  And now these messages.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  From the makers of Jenna Loves Brianna and Janine Loves Jenna, comes the next feature  to make all your wet dreams a reality.  SS Adult Films presents the greatest fuckfest of the century. 
[02:15:00]  Go, go.  But I just feel like, you know, as men, we've been down this road before.  Loves.  Oh.  Anthony.  I've gotten better handjobs from my sister.  Radio star Anthony Cumia's first gay experience is caught on tape.  For your jacking pleasure.  Ah, it's going to get bad in here.  Inhibitions are forgotten, as Anthony finally does all the things his dad told him were so  naughty.  This is like what happens in prison.  Go, go.  Loves Anthony fills you up with romance. 
[02:15:30]  Well, normally I like a couple fingers up my ass.  Fun.  Can you turn your head and cough?  And freaky gay sex cum.  Holy shit.  Oh my God.  With commentary from cock connoisseur Jim Norton.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity for Valentine's Day.  And featuring a special appearance from Andrew Dice Clay.  You know, you'll have ass fucking in here, but I can't light a fucking cigarette.  He'd never thought he'd do it, but watch Anthony diving in for his second helping of man meat. 
[02:16:00]  I'm like a fucking baby seal on an ice float that just took a mallet over the head.  I thought you were in it to win it.  Not gay.  Not anymore, Cumia.  You got a dick.  You know it feels good.  Go, go.  Loves Anthony.  Available now at the gayest stores ever.  I think the gayness is plausible.  We're back, huh? 
[02:16:30]  We're using this as a...  We're back on call.  Let's keep it professional, all right?  Oh, yeah, it's Greg Brady Day.  Yeah, we're doing Greg Brady songs, Rejoiners.  And this is from...  In honor of me waking up, Greg Brady.  What is this from, Iraq?  It's the return of Johnny Bravo.  Bear at your feet, well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away. 
[02:17:00]  He really puts a feel into the songs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just come with me and we can shake.  I want to hear the chorus.  You'll be doing fine once the music starts.  Rhythm of the night, yeah.  You're the beat of the rhythm of the night.  He articulates every word.  It's really...  He's got great pronunciation.  I'll say that for the songs.  Well, isn't it better than if he did that faux...  Like the faux black voice? 
[02:17:30]  Oh, or when he trails off on...  Oh!  What level is he at with his singing?  On a 1 to 10 scale?  I don't know.  We need some things.  Like a cruise ship singer.  Depends on...  This is more like an Indonesian ferry boat singer.  Really?  It's not really...  He likes a fucking...  He's pulling it off, though.  He's making some coin.  Yeah.  I think he should do a whole album as Johnny Bravo of all those E-Rock songs. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, wow.  That would pack him in.  E-Rock, are you in on the E-Rock song thing yet?  Now that you see it in the reaction that Colin gave it?  Nope.  Fuck.  He just doesn't get it like us.  I understand why.  Because you can feel the guy's venom through the fucking...  Yeah.  He sounds like a southern dude to his south.  Yeah, yeah.  The best part is how he just sells...  I'm an asshole!  I'm an asshole!  It's unbelievable.  Just a quiet fury of the whole thing.  It's just...  Oh.  Yeah.  I just got a text from my wife. 
[02:18:30]  You missed the SpongeBob discussion, too, Colin.  My kid picks out the worst fucking ice cream when it's ice cream time, knowing that he's  only going to eat a little and I get to eat the rest, you know, because I'm not going  to buy my own because I'm trying to watch my weight.  Sure.  But if my kid buys a little something-something, then I feel like I could eat that.  And he picks the SpongeBob thing.  So we talked about that.  So I just got a text from my wife that just reads, today's the last day I could listen to  the show.  He just said, he meaning my son, daddy said SpongeBob sucks chocolate shit. 
[02:19:00]  He's bummed out.  No.  The funny part is...  He's bummed out.  This whole time, you've been letting your son listen to this show.  I don't care.  I'm one of those guys, yeah.  Hilarious.  I'm one of those guys.  I still curse in front of him and stuff.  But the show is a whole nother level.  I know.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  I'm going to have to explain a thing or two.  About SpongeBob.  Daddy says SpongeBob sucks.  It's SpongeBob.  And they're just chocolate shit?  Yeah.  Plus, you're raising...  Because I said, what about the chocolate shit?  Oh.  You're actually raising...  What about the chocolate shit?  Right.  You're raising a child to hate E-Rock.  E-Rock's his best friend because they're on the same level with toys.  Oh, that's right.  Toys and cartoons.  Every time I go to E-Rock's house, he's got a toy for the kid.  And man, E-Rock gets down on all fucking fours and plays with that kid. 
[02:20:00]  Joke's galore for that one.  And I bought him a little Batman thing.  I'm like, you bought that because you like that.  But it turns out my son likes it, too.  But, I don't know, whatever.  Out of E-Rock.  So, now I've got to explain.  I like this Bat...  But, you know, Batman doesn't like me either, actually.  I don't like the Batman toy.  The Batman toy doesn't like me.  I mean, it's similar to me.  Well, it's because, you know, when you consider yourself a superhero, I don't like other superheroes. 
[02:20:30]  What were we going to do?  The creepy comments from kids?  Dude, I was going to...  Because we got Trace Atkins coming in here, it looks like.  Now, call me a fucking pussy.  Trace Atkins coming in?  Yes.  You know?  No, but thank God I'm here.  I'm probably the only one that watches Celebrity Apprentice all year.  I watch that.  Yeah.  Damn it.  We had Penn Jillette in yesterday.  Penn was in yesterday.  And his ice cream is way better than Trace Atkins.  Yes.  What?  What?  His ice cream?  I thought you watched it.  You didn't watch shit.  I didn't watch the final, I guess.  They had to make ice cream.  They had to make ice cream.  You tell me what flavor is better.  Ask your son. 
[02:21:00]  He'll tell you.  Chocolate shit.  What's in Penn Jillette's again?  It's sea salt.  It's chocolate and a little caramel.  Sea salt.  Chocolate sea salt.  Right.  With chocolate caramel pieces.  Right.  And it's like when you bite into it, it's caramel, not frozen caramel.  And creamy.  And you got creamy vanilla ice cream as the base.  I like the fact that Sam took one of those muffins to be polite and it's just sitting in the corner.  Yeah, what the fuck?  What a creep.  Your muffins aren't a hit.  No, they're not.  Why?  I didn't know what they were.  From Magnolia Bakery. 
[02:21:30]  I figured it's a great bakery.  It is a great bakery.  I grabbed one of the sugar muffins.  I'll tell you who's the great.  How was the sugar muffins?  We're the good muffins.  Which is also Colin's new nickname.  Yes, sugar muffins.  I'll tell you who's going to enjoy my muffins.  Guy Fieri.  Now that guy understands the taste.  Yes.  He understands culinary expertise.  You better get into that rock and roll mode because he's all about rock and roll.  Really?  Look out!  With those kicks that he can't get too high because, you know.  Let's season some stuff, guys.  Woo!  Woo!  He does a rock and roll kick, just not as high as David Lee Roth used to be. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  You guys say I don't laugh, but when you start shitting on Guy Fieri, Sam Lowe tickles me.  Is it Guy Fieri coming in?  Yeah.  That's why it's so funny.  Well, well, well.  Oh, E-Rock's grabbing a muffin.  Yeah, that's the spirit of E-Rock.  What kind are they, Carl?  I don't know.  I got to know because I can't just grab a muffin.  I said, give us a nice mix.  You went with the assortment.  I said, give me an assortment.  But every time you say that, they're going to give you the shitty ones that aren't selling.  No. 
[02:22:30]  You don't do that.  I was there first.  There was nobody there.  These are all the muffins.  All right.  I thought this was a corn muffin, but it's lemon.  It's lemon?  There's a surprise in every one.  It's never what you think with Magnolia Bakery.  What's the one you just smelled here at?  See, the crummy one looks really good.  Bring that over here, motherfucker.  They're all good.  Unless you want it.  There's a blueberry.  I had one before I even left the store.  Wait, you're going to take the apple crumb?  You son of a bitch.  We were sitting here for an hour.  I didn't know he had apple crumb in there.  See, now the muffins are a hit. 
[02:23:00]  Don't try to take it from him.  Don't try to take it from him.  You know how that works out.  You know he doesn't count calories.  Yes, calories.  Keep your hands and feet away from the hopper at all times.  Don't.  Hey, I think there's another apple crumb in here.  Of course there is.  It's a lovely assortment.  Lovely.  Hey guys, don't forget to save one for Trace.  The muffins are a hit now, officially.  Trace is like, I'm not coming in.  The show ends at 10.  He's like Tom Papa.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I remember the old days when my parents would go to a friend's house and they'd get 
[02:23:30]  that little box with the red and white string tied around it.  Oh, yeah.  With the cake for some coffee when they would talk about the black people and how they're  ruining the country.  Can I go back to Sam?  Sam, why do you like us shitting on Guy Fieri so much?  Because it's mean and it just makes...  My goal is to get tears in your eyes.  And it's unnecessary.  It's unnecessary and it makes Guy Fieri unwillingly come off as desperate because then he comes  in and you guys just spent all this time shitting on him.  Is he going to have his flame shirt on today? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, there'll be some flame thing.  With his sunglasses.  And his rock and roll hair.  All rock and rolled out.  Let me tell you how we're going to cook up these steaks.  They had Guy Fieri on the phone.  It was like 7 o'clock.  But he was in California, so it's like 4 a.m.  He woke up at 4 just to do our show.  And he's just confused on the phone because he's talking to them.  And they start yelling.  They're like, you're in your kitchen right now, huh?  Guy's like, yeah.  He's like, what are you doing, rock kicks?  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Threads the horn.  A few eggs.  He juggles them.  Look out.  Look out.  Get guys on the phone with them.  That's right, people.  We're going to be cooking.  Could this be his entrance music when he comes here?  Of course it should be.  All right.  Make sure you replay this.  Yeah.  This is good Guy Fieri entrance music.  I like the thing where you guys wake people up like Barry Williams and Guy Fieri at like  4 in the morning.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Totally unaware.  I kind of like that.  It catches them off guard.  You get an honest minute-long interview with them.  Greg Brady pretty much threatened me. 
[02:25:00]  Well, why do you even...  He threatened me.  What?  What'd he say?  Opie.  He was scared I was going to give his phone number out to everybody.  And you called him and he was asleep.  Yeah, but we thought it was his voicemail because what was it again?  What's he answering the phone?  Say what?  He answers the phone by saying, say what?  Say what?  This is it.  Right here.  Listen.  Say what?  So I thought that was his voicemail.  I'm waiting for the beep and I'm going to go, hey, Opie, what's up, Barry?  And blah, blah, blah.  Call me back.  But it was him waiting for me to say something. 
[02:25:30]  Ah.  Well, they're on MTV.  You know, they were on remote control with us a lot of times at Brady's.  Were they really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not a really good story.  That's a big part of my life.  Hey.  The Two Celebrity Apprentice ice creams.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So the first one is sea salt chocolate, caramel pieces.  Quit saying that.  Go on to the next ingredient.  And like a creamy vanilla base.  Creamy vanilla is the base, okay?  It sounds lovely.  Then the next one is macadamia nut and maple. 
[02:26:00]  Macadamia nut and maple.  Honestly, though, I'll say one thing.  It's all for a good cause.  But if you could make any ice cream, why would you make macadamia nut and maple?  Sam, you're smart.  You're a lot smarter than people realize, Sam.  But Sam, you're fired.  You're fired.  Do his compliment.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're actually good.  You're actually very good.  You're very good.  You're very.  You're fired.  You know, but Gary Busey, he's kind of a genius, though, isn't he? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, I guess.  So don't fire him.  Yeah.  Don't fire him because he, you know, he's the odd guy.  I think both of those ice creams sound like shit.  How's that?  How about this?  Vanilla and chocolate and strawberry, Sam.  How about that?  I like that.  You're a purist.  It's bullshit.  I don't want to hear this shit anymore.  You're a purist, Colin.  I like it.  Just like the way he speaks about the Constitution.  Exactly.  Yes, yes.  You know, the Constitution is fascinating.  What is the most popular amendment?  Ah, well, right now, the Second Amendment. 
[02:27:00]  The Second?  Everybody in the country agrees on the Second Amendment.  What about the First, though, with this AP scandal?  Everybody agrees on the Second right now.  The whole country is unified.  The First, the AP, yeah, the AP scandal.  The AP scandal.  Oh, yes.  I like how the press is kind of all of a sudden, now they're like, hey, Obama, like all this  other shit.  Yeah.  They haven't been, they've been like, well, you know, the President.  They're not like that over this, either.  No.  What?  Yeah, come see the show.  You'll see, they're just like this, like, what's going on?  We'll take care of it.  Oh, thank God.  Okay.  That's what we want to hear. 
[02:27:30]  They're not as outraged as they should be.  Oh, forget about it.  Obama's getting away with a lot of scandals.  I think it helps him having more scandals.  Because if you have one scandal, it's bad, because then they concentrate on that.  If you've got like three, four different scandals going on, no one really gets a good  grasp on one single scandal.  That's a good point.  But, you know, but the other argument is in this country where everybody has to have  10 things going on at once.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We can focus.  I think this country has ADD anyways.  Having a few is probably, you know. 
[02:28:00]  I don't know.  Nixon should have fucking thought of that.  What else can I get myself into?  Henry, help me out.  Help a nigger out.  What can I do?  I want to get into another scandal.  This Watergate thing is tanking me.  And then he just fucking finds something else, you know?  Where's Benghazi?  I don't know.  Well, maybe we can go after some people with the IRS.  Put Liddy on it.  He's a sneaky little fuck.  You've heard the tapes, right?  Yes.  Oh, great. 
[02:28:30]  It's not far off from what it's doing right now.  There's Ben Stein, my Jew speechwriter.  Get him in here.  How about when you have that one where he goes,  the Jews, why do they like therapy so much?  Why do they like pot so much?  I think it's because they're all therapists.  They're all therapists.  Oh, those tapes are fucking a hoot.  Oh, that Nixon was great.  Nixon was a brilliant guy, though.  He was.  And you know what?  Not a bad president for those times.  No.  He was a very, you know.  You could hang him out to try.  Opened up that China. 
[02:29:00]  Opened up that China to everybody.  That was a mysterious fucking land.  We introduced the world to the panda bear.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  How cool is that?  If you got elected in 1968 and this country wasn't set on fire by 1970,  you did something next.  Yes.  This country's hard to explode.  I put Elvis on the DEA.  Right.  I'm a smart guy.  And I got the kids involved.  I know.  That was the...  I'll never forget.  Even in the 80s when George Schultz, one of these guys, goes,  we don't want the Beach Boys performing at the White House. 
[02:29:30]  They're too like a wild hippie band.  Yeah.  He's like, 83.  What?  How out of touch.  Oh, my God.  The Beach Boys in 83, a hippie band?  He's like, they're like the ball of the country.  Right.  I used to watch like the fucking Watergate procedure.  I was fucking kidding.  Me too.  And I was watching like Judge Sirica.  Yes.  They were like famous names.  Sirica.  Yes.  You're not that much older than me.  There was no way I was watching that shit.  I was too young.  But it was on every TV.  Yes.  Whatever TV was on.  There was TV in the house.  They were watching it. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Parents watching, she was watching in the background.  Yeah.  All right.  It was a little boring, but still.  There was no house with a lot of water.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  More importantly, the singer from the song we play, the E-Rock song, just wrote me.  Oh.  What did he say?  Sean F.  Sean F.  He's thrilled.  He's absolutely honored.  Oh.  Colin loves the song.  I'm actually from Jersey and close enough to commute to Sirius if a position becomes available.  Oh, great.  We might not have a position, but I think Sean F. should come in studio and perform some 
[02:30:30]  of these songs live.  Probably should.  Live would be great.  Can I tell you something that's really going to upset E-Rock?  Yeah.  There have, and I don't want to, people have thought about, they were, I was asked yesterday  whether bringing on somebody like Sean F. as like a freelancer would be a good idea  by a boss.  How did E-Rock respond?  E-Rock didn't find out about that until just now.  Oh.  Oh, no.  One of the bosses is just, has a conversation piece saying, you know, would you think that 
[02:31:00]  the show could use.  Because they're known for good ideas, right?  Oh, sure.  Somebody like Sean F. as a freelancer.  Nice one, E-Rock.  I love when E-Rock fights back.  It's rare, but it's beautiful.  I said yes.  Wow.  He did.  Yeah.  Wow.  Colin, your breakfast has arrived.  Now, Colin, Jimmy Norton said that you like taking your tea and pouring it out over  your muffins and then eating it like a fucking savage like that.  He really got on to about it.  Just the opposite of a savage. 
[02:31:30]  I think it's like the civilized gentleman's way to do it.  Dumping coffee out or tea out onto a muffin?  Yes.  I don't know.  It's like you're watering your muffin.  I think dipping, maybe with a fork and a knife, dipping it in.  Well, I think that Jim, now his new culinary attitude is an inspiration to us all.  But it certainly is Mr. Blueberry and Strawberries.  He really is a...  He does look like an aardvark when he eats.  He looks like he forages more than eats, really, at this point. 
[02:32:00]  But his self-hatred hasn't gone down one iota, even though he looks at himself in the mirror  and sees a new Jim Norton there.  Right.  He just still despises himself.  I don't know.  I've always been very cautious about comedians being self-hating.  I have a hard time with it sometimes.  But thinking that they are or knowing that they are?  Well, I understand there's a certain style of it that we are, but just the fact that  you get up and get paid for people to listen to you talk, there's something else there.  There is something else there, but you could also say that that's making up for the part 
[02:32:30]  that...  No, I feel like people with really low self-esteem cower in a corner at a party and never say  a word.  Comedians all get theirs, if you'll notice.  Yeah.  For all the talk.  Right.  They go out and get theirs, so...  You know what I mean?  Oh, Colin, really mixing it up here today with this...  No kidding.  And this one, I didn't see that coming.  By the way, B-Rock didn't get the only apple fucking crumb.  That isn't a muffin.  You're eating apple pie for breakfast.  Delicious.  Magnolia Bakery. 
[02:33:00]  It sounds fantastic.  Well, then I'll be able to tell Guy, ah, I would love to eat your food, but I'm full.  What'd you have?  You're not going to eat Guy's food?  And then he'd be like, what'd you have, bro?  Yeah, what'd you eat instead of this great food?  Pew, pew!  Flame shooting out of his fingers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Should we have some Bloody Marys?  Because I'm sure he had a rough night last night.  Yeah.  Does he have, like, one of those knives and a scabbard on his belt and a fucking, like,  salt and pepper shaker on the other?  Yeah, exactly.  Pulls him out like a gun out of a holster?  Oh, yeah, I've seen it.  Let me dice this for you. 
[02:33:30]  Hey!  I'm dicing it!  You got his rock and roll steak knives.  What?  He was making the deal when I went there.  They shaped like guitars?  Sam, will you tell that twink to bring in my Diet Cokes, please?  Oh!  Sal, where are the Diet Cokes?  He asked for two Diet Cokes.  I was here when he asked.  It was clear.  Make a fucking maniac out of me.  Oh, let me ask Carl.  So Guy Fieri invites me to his restaurant for lunch.  Nice.  And I show up with a couple of these guys. 
[02:34:00]  Muscle.  All of a sudden, he's like, I see him.  They bring me to see him.  And, yeah, there's the rock and roll knives.  They got, like, flames.  What are they?  And he was making a deal for his rock and roll knives when I went to his restaurant.  Are they actually called rock and roll knives?  Yeah, they are.  Oh, no, it's the Fieri Knuckle Sandwich Series knives.  Like, I'm going to give you a knuckle sandwich.  I'd love to see one of those snaps off in his chest.  So I get the invite.  We go there for lunch. 
[02:34:30]  And I'm showing my table, assuming this will be the table that me and Guy Fieri will be dining at.  Long story short, I'm not eating with Guy Fieri.  And he shows up at the end to make sure everything was cool.  That's what the chef does.  Wouldn't he be insulted?  No.  He invited me to lunch.  I mean, did it with the captain on a ship?  No, exactly.  They stopped by.  Look, it's Guy Fieri, though.  I'm not, it's not like Paul Hanks.  But he's at work.  That's true.  He's at work.  He's working.  He's got to fucking, he can't show favoritism.  Yeah, he's got to act like he's a chef.  No, he's walking around to other people's tables.  He wasn't in the fucking kitchen making my food. 
[02:35:00]  Hey, he oversees it.  Like that guy that yells at everybody.  He gave him the recipes a year ago, and that's it.  He's not in the kitchen making it.  Oh, he's got to.  What's that?  Why isn't this up on the line?  What the fuck's going on here?  I need this out there.  I like a guy in the kitchen that's yelling and making the cooks want to spit in the food.  That's wonderful.  Dispatch it.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck that guy.  Who is that?  Who's the yelly guy?  Who's the yelling chef?  Help me out here.  Gordon Ramsay.  Gordon Ramsay.  Gordon Ramsay.  I wouldn't want to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant because he's pissing off the staff so much 
[02:35:30]  that they're going to do shit to the food.  Right.  Say, fuck this guy.  Let me give the entire restaurant diarrhea.  You watch Kitchen Nightmares, though?  I've watched, like, one of his shows where they're all the same, aren't they?  You see the soul food restaurant?  No.  What happened there?  And everyone was fucking pissed off.  Were they?  It was hilarious.  Like, fuck that motherfucker.  Oh, that's basically what they were saying.  I don't need that shit from that motherfucker.  That's basically what they were saying.  All that shit.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Crack-ass motherfucker.  Don't know shit about no soul food. 
[02:36:00]  Lincoln freed the slaves.  Yeah, motherfucker.  He went into his restaurant and half the menu they didn't have.  Really?  Yeah.  He ordered all this shit, and they're like, yeah, we ran out of that stuff months ago.  Well, we make you some of this.  And they didn't update their menu.  Whew.  Fucking hate that.  You want to talk about creepy kids or no?  I don't know.  There were a couple stories I was thinking.  Well, kids, apparently.  You guys should talk about the hottest topics.  What about David Beckham retiring?  That's a big one. 
[02:36:30]  Is that why he was trending yesterday?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I thought he retired like 10 years ago.  Exactly.  His wife said, didn't he retire like 10 years ago?  He retired when he came to fucking the United States to play soccer.  Is he big on just those newspapers that are all lies from England, where you read them  and it's like...  Oh, the Star and all that stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Do English people really think that's real news?  I bet half of it is true.  No.  I don't believe a lot of it.  I think it's very tabloid-ish.  Yeah.  And I mean old-school tabloid.  New tabloids are all true.  Yeah.  That's all true shit. 
[02:37:00]  And then the real newspapers now is the fake shit, because they don't want to be politically  correct and they don't want to fucking, you know...  That's right.  So when you look at the Inquirer and the Star, that's all real now.  Yeah.  It used to be fake shit.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, Beckham, I guess...  Wait, wait, wait.  Hey!  Oh!  Take a seat.  Have a muffin.  Have a muffin.  Oh, muffins.  Don't worry, Tom.  If the area comes in, I'm going to jump right over the couch.  Did you see that? 
[02:37:30]  No!  No!  That's how it is.  No!  Did you take the F or the D?  I took the D!  It was so easy.  I went downstairs.  I got right on the train.  I came right in.  It was like 10 minutes.  I couldn't believe how fast it was.  Hold on, Tom.  While this piece of shit's in here, you want something to eat?  Yes, you scumbag!  Give me a goddamn coffee, Black!  All right.  I need another coffee.  How good was Colin Quinn last night?  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Before we get to that point, let's start with something else.  He guilted you into coming in today. 
[02:38:00]  He guilted you.  The first one was Roland.  As I was going into the shower.  Really?  The guys want you to come by.  Sounds sexy.  Roland.  The guys want you to come by for the show.  If you're free.  If you're around and you want to hang out, you can come in and you can hang out.  If you're free, you guys can tell me to make any noise, you can hear me.  What?  Every word tails into the next.  His speech pattern's like mercury on a fucking mirror.  It's just all melding into each other and coming apart. 
[02:38:30]  You never know if he's sincere or not.  If you want.  I mean, I don't know.  But I heard the conversation.  It was so obvious.  You were like, I don't know.  It's already 9 o'clock, this and that.  And Colin is like, what?  The D train's right below you.  It's 10 minutes.  It's really true.  But I'm waving Colin off like, look, we'll get him next.  It's cool.  Don't worry about it.  As I'm on the phone, my wife is looking at me and she's overhearing the conversation. 
[02:39:00]  She's making like these puppy dog eyes.  Does Colin want you to go in?  You should go.  See that?  Oh, Colin was so great last night.  Yeah, huh?  It is an amazing show.  Well, thanks.  It's funny.  It's so damn funny.  I know you're smart.  I know you're trying to be prolific.  But it's kick-ass funny.  I loved it.  I don't think Opie appreciated when he was trying to go out and do his job that Bob Kelly  and then you were busting his balls because he had to get up early and acted like he was 
[02:39:30]  being anti-social.  Were you listening to the show today?  No.  For some reason, my password's not working.  I can't listen to the show.  Of course it isn't.  Why would it?  Oh, it's the worst.  No, but you were like a phantom.  I was by myself and I was tired to begin with.  You sat next to a really cute girl.  Yes, I did.  I saw her sit next to you.  I was like, oh, let's go.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  And she was alone, too.  Thank God your wife and son aren't listening to the show anymore.  And then I tried to sneak out and then Bob Kelly's like, hey, Lonely, where are you going? 
[02:40:00]  And I was feeling lonely.  I didn't go with anyone.  I wasn't feeling that great.  I've been dealing with a stupid allergy thing.  So I'm like, I'm going to go support Colin, check it out and get the fuck out of there.  But of course, Bob has to pipe up in front of everybody.  I didn't even see you.  And then I had to talk to Bob and his wife for like 15 minutes.  Oh, God.  Bob tried to grab him.  He grabbed, you know how he's touchy-feely. 
[02:40:30]  So I jump and he goes, relax, was molested.  I'm like.  Called you was molested.  Doesn't mean I was molested because I don't want you touching me.  Because he touches you in a very aggressive way.  He is aggressive.  You mean we, meaning everybody.  Thank you.  Yeah.  He's like the Turkish prison guard from Midnighters.  He really is.  And then he doesn't understand when we don't accept it.  I know, because he's been touched like that his whole life.  Thank you.  I was looking at him in the middle of the show because I was sitting up top and I could see 
[02:41:00]  the whole audience.  Which is another way of saying, thanks for the last row, Colin.  Oh.  And then I look down and I see, you know, Colin's shows, they're smart, they're very top.  He had stuff from Beckham, which just happened yesterday.  He had stuff that happened, the IRS stuff, which just happened this week.  I mean, very current, very smart, very funny.  I look at Bobby at one point.  He just, he's not laughing.  He's just staring like with this look of resentment.  I'm thinking, oh.  He must be thinking about his own writing right now. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He must be thinking.  That's what we get you like.  Bob was resenting my show.  Yes, he was.  That son of a bitch.  I think it put his own, his own writing habits in.  Wait, could you guys play that Sympathy for E-Rock?  Do you know E-Rock?  Oh, yeah.  We'll have to play it for Tom, but Trace Adkins is going to be here in a minute.  Oh, really?  This song is so funny.  You have to hear.  Well, he's got ten E-Rock songs.  They're all terrific.  Oh, exactly.  Yeah, I think I heard some of those.  Well, we might have a minute to kill. 
[02:42:00]  Maybe we should play another one for Kyle, though.  I don't know.  I want to hear that one again.  Sam, the pressure's on.  Play him like another one.  Just, Snacks is pretty good.  Snacks is good.  You know the song, Shot, Shot, Shot, Shot, you know?  Yeah.  Okay.  Play that one real fast.  Does Colin know that one?  Do you know the song?  No.  Lil Jon?  No, I only know Sympathy for E-Rock.  He's not going to like it if he doesn't know it, so why would you play that?  But we can't replay that one.  Did he do any Simon and Garfunkel?  What about Pumped Up Tits?  That one we didn't like that much because it was kind of sweet. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, you've heard all these.  You've heard all these.  I've heard that one.  Okay.  Forget it.  Forget it, Bob.  I don't think I heard the Sympathy one.  Forget it, Bob.  Trace is a big boy, too.  How big is he?  Six, five.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  I've never heard this.  I'm a man of size and weight.  Yeah.  Rock.  Worked in radio for a long, long time, but my skills are far from great.  Write fan fiction and I hate my job because they make fun of my shape. 
[02:43:00]  This is round.  I had to stay home after Sandy left because a branch blocked my escape.  He did.  He took the day off because of one branch.  Yeah.  Good morning.  I'm an asshole.  He is.  Won't you guess my name?  He rocks.  Oh, yeah.  I've been known as sex bagels.  He did.  Sex bagels.  And I don't watch sports at all.  No, he watches fucking cartoons. 
[02:43:30]  All the time.  Like a child.  I bring nothing to the table.  Nothing.  I love garlic.  Butter sauce.  He did.  He even talked about it on a pizza.  So if you see me, show some sympathy.  We do.  Because I don't count calories.  Obviously.  I shouted out who broke the toilet seat.  We know where this is going.  When all the while, I knew it was me.  What is he?  I'm an asshole. 
[02:44:00]  Won't you guess my name?  That is a good one.  That is a good one.  I write bad fiction.  Well, he does.  Everything's true in that song.  My sheep.  That's the brutality.  I like having the TV director's cut.  When somebody breaks down your life into the smallest details, it's brutal.  It's very hurtful.  It is brutal.  You heard about his movie, right?  That he's writing.  You're watching.  Yeah, he's writing a movie about, how long is the movie?  90 minutes.  90 minutes long.  And it covers how many decades? 
[02:44:30]  I think five.  Five decades.  It's somebody that kind of goes somehow, we don't even know, goes back in time.  And then fucking like, doesn't bother affecting any history or anything in his life.  It's back to the future without all that fun stuff.  Or the DeLorean or anything.  But why can't he affect history?  Because he chooses not to for some dumb fuck reason.  Because he's lazy.  Did you stop fucking, did you stop the fucking Pearl Harbor attack?  Did you stop fucking, you know, all these tragedies that happened? 
[02:45:00]  9-11.  Kennedy assassination.  Anything.  9-11's a big one.  Nah.  Nah.  He just sits on the couch.  That's it.  He just sits there for fucking decades.  It's his own dream of time travel.  He won't even say why.  The first movie he's writing in, it's a fucking 10 decade period piece that is impossible to produce.  It's great.  We want to make sure it's super expensive.  Yeah.  James Cameron, fucking CGI, all kinds of shit.  God.  He didn't want anybody to be sympathetic to the main character.  Right.  He didn't want him relatable. 
[02:45:30]  So he didn't help.  And then he finds a girlfriend, and then Jim Norton is in it, and he's at a radio station,  because apparently the guy gets into radio at some point.  Of course he does.  Of course he does.  Why does he pick Jimmy over us for the radio parts?  Because him and Jimmy sat down.  Oh, you picked Jimmy.  I know some people I can get it to, too, by my manager.  You're right.  You're right.  You know, I could get this thing greenlit for you.  That's his big ace in the hole when he throws Norton's name out.  And the studio executives stare blankly. 
[02:46:00]  I know some of the people at Fox Searchlight.  The pressures aren't, because Trace Atkins is coming in here, and Colin's going to be  watching us very closely to see if our personalities change.  Colin, he is going to say, wow, these guys are really good friends with Colin Quinn.  I hope so.  That's what Trace Atkins is going to walk away with.  I was just saying, I hated when Bill and Opie threw me under the bus when stupid Mark Cuban  came in.  They ruined my friendship with a billionaire.  I was the only one who knew him.  You really were.  And Bill and Opie's like, Dad, he's still taking over.  He was the third mic.  It was infuriating.  Oh, I can't even think about it. 
[02:46:30]  Bill's more confrontational now than he used to be.  Yes, he is.  Very confrontational.  Yes, he is.  I was watching him in the movie with stand-up guys.  And there he is with fucking Pacino.  And he's fucking acting with Pacino.  Right.  Oh, really?  It's crazy.  Bill, what happened to Bill was somewhere along the line.  And I remember when it was at the cellar.  One day, he just said, that's it.  He started to be called Bill instead of Billy.  Yeah.  Yes.  It was just like that full metal jacket thing when suddenly Private Pyle just turns into  like a warrior. 
[02:47:00]  Yes.  That's a building.  That's a building.  That's really true.  Outstanding, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  I still call him Billy, and he does not like it.  No, he does not.  No, Billy.  He hates it.  Tommy.  Tommy's a lot.  I wouldn't mind that.  I actually...  All right, let Trace in.  I'm going to go sit in the couch, but I don't want them to change.  No, you sit right where you are.  I don't want them to change my style.  You stay there.  No one puts cards in the corner.  Why is everyone moving around?  I'm going to take this.  Don't be here.  Wallet. 
[02:47:30]  There you go.  Tom Papa.  You're like a big dude.  I noticed you've been noticing my gift.  Yeah, what is that?  It's so beautiful.  This is my crystal decanter with four crystal glasses from someone you might know, Paul Anka.  No.  With a little handwritten note.  How old school is that?  He does the show.  Using my real name and everything.  He writes, Dear Greg, what a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it.  And look forward to the next time with much respect.  He was the coolest guy I ever met. 
[02:48:00]  I bet Rita Hayworth got notes like that.  You were here for Paul Anka.  I was here for Anka.  He was here.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  And he started talking about how he was going to give everyone his French cologne.  Right.  And I couldn't mooch my way into Anka.  Man, he was great.  And he's coming back Tuesday because he had so much fun.  Colin didn't like what they thought he was.  I didn't like the fact.  Well, we hung up on it.  Remember, he was on the phone.  That's right.  You were trying to get in.  No respect for a guy that's been with us.  No respect. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  Sal's going to get something, but it's under open.  What happens?  Sal.  I don't know.  Sal's funny.  What are you doing?  He's got his head in your lap.  What the fuck is he doing?  He's trying to blow you.  You really needed to get that?  Really?  You're a moe, Sal.  You really needed to get that.  The battery's going to die.  The battery's going to die.  Andy, you didn't get one at the decanter?  You know what?  I wasn't here that day, if you recall.  Oh, that's right.  I was out with the bad cough.  I had a touch of the vapors.  That's right.  He started off his whole thing talking about how he was going to get sick. 
[02:49:00]  I got the consumption.  Trace Atkins.  Here comes the Magnolia bakery treats.  That's not Trace Atkins.  No.  Is that the wife that shot him?  Should we not bring that up?  Oh, God damn.  Hi, I'm Trace Atkins.  There he is, Trace.  Trace Atkins.  Take a seat over here.  Pull up a mic.  We're on the air live.  We just do this.  There's the voice.  They told me y'all were, so.  Oh, yeah?  God damn, Trace Atkins.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:49:30]  We're really good.  We have mitts on him, too.  I know.  Do you know Colin Quinn?  Stop holding my hand, Quinn.  I'm a smitty.  How you doing?  Good to see you.  Back in the day.  You guys know each other?  No.  No, but I'm a fan.  I'm a fan of Conklin.  And Tom Papa to your right.  Hey, Trace.  He's good friends with Jerry Seinfeld.  That's his claim.  No, I mean.  He's acting with Michael Douglas in a new movie.  The Liberace movie.  The Liberace movie.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I'll brag for my pal Tom Papa. 
[02:50:00]  Thank you.  Do you want to see Trace or any of his buddies down there who are going to go see that Liberace movie?  Hell no.  Hells no.  I'm probably not.  Trace, we had a Penn Jillette in here yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  And he was pitching his ice cream.  You know, Apprentice, a celebrity all-star, friggin' amazing Apprentice this season.  You guys are head-to-head now.  Yeah.  So, now the object is to sell this ice cream.  Yes.  At this point. 
[02:50:30]  Right.  How do you feel you're doing?  I'm doing great.  I got a little pint of Penn's ice cream yesterday.  I found a booger right on the top.  Oh, shit.  It was a booger right on the top.  Oh, shit.  It was a booger on the top of it.  So, his ice cream has boogers in it, I'm just telling you.  That could be detrimental to ice cream sales.  At least I tried to disguise mine with macadamia nuts.  So, if something falls in there during production, people think it's a macadamia.  Right.  That's a good strategy.  But his just has boogers. 
[02:51:00]  But we've got to explain to Trace, we're really good friends with Penn Jillette.  He does the show a lot.  But then we kind of started looking into your history, and we're all in.  We're hoping you win this thing.  We're like Penn is sunk.  Because your back story is way better than Penn Jillette's.  Absolutely.  As far as country artists go, you fit that bill that everyone has stereotyped over the  years of taking tragedy and turning it around, pulling yourself up by the proverbial bootstraps,  as they say.  Well, I suppose so.  That's why I think I've written one positive love song in my life. 
[02:51:30]  And I was commissioned to write that one.  And I think that's about it.  Now, you came up as a working guy.  You know, you worked in real...  I worked in oil field for 10 years.  Oil field.  I worked offshore on a drilling rig for six years, roughneck, worked derrick's.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's a real job.  I cut my finger off.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently, we read you cut your finger off.  Yeah, I cut that one off.  It was then...  Right off.  It's permanently at 90 degree angle. 
[02:52:00]  They put it back on.  They put it back on, but it's bent like that.  The doctor asked me, he said, it's not going to work anymore.  I think I can save it, but how do you want it?  Do you want it straight?  And I said, no.  I said, put it in a sus position.  So now you can play.  I said, at least I can suspend a D or a G, you know.  I said, put it in a sus position.  He went, excuse me?  I showed him with my other hand.  I said, dude, like that.  That's having some forethought.  Wow.  Well, dude, no, not really.  Because, I mean, the second that I cut it, that was the first thing I thought, well, 
[02:52:30]  there goes my guitar playing.  You know, I was pretty much over at that point.  Wow.  There's no way he's seeing Liberace.  No, no, no, no.  No, it's not.  No.  Wait, you worked in those oil rigs that go off the coast and stuff?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's where the offshore ones are, Carl.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I hung out to dry there.  I'm sorry, Colin.  I didn't mean to.  I told Colin I'd be nice to him when another guest was in.  And by the way, as Bobby Kelly pointed out to me, it was always funny to me when it  was Boss or Bobby Kelly. 
[02:53:00]  Then it was me.  Then I was like, oh, this is not funny at all.  That's true.  Man, that thing you and Seinfeld did a while back was brilliant.  Oh, thanks.  Damn.  Absolutely brilliant.  The one-man show?  That was brilliant.  He's got a new one that we saw last night.  That was great.  Great.  I'll bust it out.  I want to.  That's great.  I'm all over it.  I'm in.  He does do a great day.  What are your...  Barrow Street Theater.  What are your...  I could probably guess, but your political affiliations as far as things that are going  on the news these days?  What I say is the dismantling of the Constitution. 
[02:53:30]  Do you get involved in much of that?  Well, I don't get involved in it.  You know, I don't...  And people know that, too.  They come to my shows, and they're not going to get beat over the head with any kind of...  That's good.  I don't do that.  And I never have.  And I...  You know what?  And I don't like people that do.  But at least, you know, some of the ones that do it, they're right up front with it.  And you know that going in, that you're going to get that.  I don't like to be ambushed by somebody.  Right, right, right.  But anyway, I'm a pretty conservative guy, sure.  And what's going on right now, you know, I believe that when the government starts using 
[02:54:00]  agencies to persecute people that they have political and philosophical differences with,  that's tyranny, my friend.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  God damn, I got to agree.  And with that fucking voice saying it like that?  Yep.  Yeah.  That means business.  It makes you believe.  I agree.  No kidding.  God, it's so nice.  It's so refreshing to see somebody in the business that we call show.  Right.  Well, I'm sure you heard something similar to that from Penn yesterday. 
[02:54:30]  Well, yeah.  Yeah, a little bit.  Penn, again, also doesn't really put himself out there politically that much.  Yeah, he is a libertarian and an atheist.  He's sort of a libertarian.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a quasi-libertarian.  And a libertarian's just a Republican who smokes dope.  That's true.  That's really true.  Do you go shooting and stuff?  Yeah, I've heard something needs shooting.  No, very good, yeah.  I mean, I enjoy a little gunfire, but I go to the range. 
[02:55:00]  You know, there's not much going on.  Well, I do appreciate my Second Amendment right.  I've got a lot of guns.  I've got a lot of guns.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't have as many guns as he does.  I've got a lot.  It's very difficult in New York, too.  You've got Predator drones.  Well, I don't have a Predator drone.  I want one of those.  He's got one.  I want a drone, man.  Well, no, I've got a pretty big one with cameras on it and stuff.  I can send it up autonomously to patrol the neighborhood.  Awesome, awesome.  That's great.  I monitored some people getting a pizza delivery the other day.  It was very exciting, very compelling video I got from that one. 
[02:55:30]  But, no, I really do.  And in New York, it's very difficult, as you probably know, to even say that you own guns.  But, no, I love it.  I picked up a Barrett .50 caliber.  Man, they make those just right down the road from where I live in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  Oh, isn't that fantastic?  You ever fire one of those?  I have.  A lot of fun.  I don't have one yet.  I'm about to get one.  I just got a Desert Eagle .50 caliber.  I got one of those, too.  Oh, wow.  What a treat.  You take that down to the indoor range and fire it.  They won't. 
[02:56:00]  At my indoor range, they won't let me shoot it.  They won't?  No.  Over here in Nessau, they let me.  But you watch everybody from all the other slots.  They peek their head around like, what the hell?  Right, yeah.  Somebody's got a cannon.  Is he firing that?  You know what?  It's a .50 caliber pistol.  Yeah.  It's the Arnold Schwarzenegger one from that.  Yeah.  The guy that I got it from, you know, he said, dude, don't ever shoot anybody in your house  with this.  It's not the most practical.  Wait until they go outside. 
[02:56:30]  It's going to ruin everything.  Because it will make a mess.  It's not the most practical gun to have, but it is a lot of fun.  I'm not worried about the killing.  I'm worried about the cleanup.  The mess.  You shoot a melon with that thing, and it just explodes.  You can't find a lot of it.  It explodes.  It's fantastic.  It's fun to shoot.  Yeah, it is.  Is it heavy?  Yeah, it's heavy.  Very.  You put a full magazine in there, because the shells are really, really big.  You could bludgeon. 
[02:57:00]  You could do some damage with just beating someone.  You don't have to shoot anybody.  You don't have to shoot the damn thing.  We've got to ask you, man.  Speaking of shooting, what we learned about yesterday, you got shot in the heart.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Holy fuck.  How'd that happen?  The story is insane.  Really mad woman.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You know, and she had the pistol, and it was, I learned a very good life lesson from that.  I held my hand out like this, and I said, give me that pistol, or I'm going to take it 
[02:57:30]  away from you and beat your goddamn brains out with it.  Oh.  And she stuck it under my arm.  Oh.  A little trigger.  Oh, man.  A bullet went in here and came out here.  Oh, wow.  Gee.  I mean, it went straight across the chest cavity.  Went through both my lungs.  Went through my arm.  Did you think that was it?  Was it right in your chest?  You know, when something like that happens, you just, you know, you don't think.  You know, I just remember thinking that it was brand new Berber carpet, and I thought,  if I bleed on this carpet, she's going to shoot me again. 
[02:58:00]  Holy Christ.  So I went to a room that had tile floor and laid down there to die.  It's amazing what you think.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How close were you to dying?  Huh?  How close were you?  I don't know.  You know, they life-flighted me to the trauma center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,  and they saved my life.  Yeah.  It was, had it not been for that trauma center there, I wouldn't be here.  Did she call 911?  She did.  She did.  Yeah.  She did.  That's, and he never pressed charges.  Well, I got a good, clean divorce out of the deal. 
[02:58:30]  Wow.  You know what?  You know what?  After my divorce, I would rather have been shot.  It would have been less painful.  Now we understand.  Financially viable.  Because we're like, how do you not press charges?  Well, he answered that question.  That is a good...  It was cheaper.  That's a good chip to bring into the courtroom with you.  Oh, yeah.  And by the way.  Right.  Let's not forget.  Yeah.  Wow.  No, no, it didn't go to court.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow. 
[02:59:00]  That is something.  You must have really pissed her off.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  I really did.  Tom's taking her side.  I love it.  He's like, hey, Trace, what do you do?  Trace, I'll be remiss if I said, just enjoy a muffin from Magnolla.  My body is covered with scars, and I deserve every one of them.  Every one of them, huh?  I'm not going to sit here and try to say anything.  An oil rig accident is rarely just, hey, someone got a Band-Aid over there.  It usually ends up being pretty...  Yeah, I got a scar here, you know, I busted my ribs, and, you know, my elbows, I've had 
[02:59:30]  to operate on this, because I was jacking the pipe and the derrick, you know, and I wore  my elbows out, so I'm all used up, but, you know...  Was that good money at the time?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Better than what I make now.  I make hundreds of dollars a year now.  Fuck, man.  Oh, damn.  Were you playing music the whole time you were out there, or did that come up later?  No, yeah, I was playing guitar and trying to write stuff when I was out there. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, I started...  My old man got me a guitar when I was 10.  I don't really know why he did it.  He didn't play.  So, that's when I started.  Oh, wow.  And what was the big break there that got you off the rig?  Uh, well, my second wife wanted to move far away from my first wife, because they didn't  get along at all.  Yeah.  So, we moved, and she said, let's move.  I can't stand her, and I was like, okay, well, I don't really like her that much either. 
[03:00:30]  Where do you want to go?  And I said, let's just go to Nashville.  I said, you know, I like to sing and play, and maybe I can make something happen, so...  Were you knocking around the clubs over there in Nashville?  Yeah, I played clubs there for about three years.  They got a lot of bars.  I was working construction and playing.  You got to have a day gig in Nashville, too.  Yeah, yeah.  And you just kind of played clubs in the same way until someone notices, and...  Yeah, I played the club circuit in Texas for about five years, and Texas, the Southwest, 
[03:01:00]  Texas, New Mexico, you know, Oklahoma.  I played that circuit for five years.  Did you enjoy it?  In the late 80s.  Was it fun?  Yeah, I did.  I really did enjoy it, and it finally got to a point where I faced myself in the mirror  one morning and said, you know what, five years ago, I wouldn't even have hung out with  somebody like you, because I'd gotten really strung out, and it was, you know, I had to  get away from it, go back to the oil field to save my life.  Wow, really?  Wow.  Damn.  That's partying.  That's some perspective.  That's what strung out means. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  From you, from the Liberace movie.  Which one of you Nancys doesn't like maple in my ice cream, anyway?  Oh, boy, I don't know.  Who said that?  Sam, was that you?  Somebody said...  Oh, Sam, saying he doesn't like maple.  Yeah, I don't know who said that, Trace.  That would be crazy to say in front of you.  We just assumed, with everything you have going on in your life, you were probably head  of the Maple Producers Coalition or something.  Hey, let me write that down.  Yeah, write that down. 
[03:02:00]  We're all big fans of maple, right in.  Yeah, yeah.  We love maple.  This is where it starts.  Now, stop.  Trace, you're an oil rig guy, a badass, a ball fighter.  How the hell did you end up with maple macadamia mashup?  We wouldn't have stopped to it today.  Okay.  We wouldn't have stopped to it.  All right.  Let me tell you where I'm at in my life right now, man.  Yes.  I have prostitutes coming up to me going, dude, the shit you're doing for money is just...  You know what I mean? 
[03:02:30]  How can you live with yourself?  And I don't disagree.  I have no pride anymore.  You know what, though?  I'm just like Quinn.  We sold our dignity a long time ago.  And I sold mine cheap.  I don't know about him.  I got to say, though, the All-Star Apprentice ice cream here from Trace, the maple macadamia mashup, proceeds go into the Red Cross, the American Red Cross.  Right.  See, that's pretty goddamn good right there.  You can't totally say you're sold out. 
[03:03:00]  And then also your Wounded Warrior project work is amazing.  Well, that's been a privilege.  Absolutely, right?  You know, the association with them has just been a humbling experience for me.  I've been doing that for a few years now.  Just a great organization.  We hope you win Celebrity Apprentice.  I do, too.  I do.  You just told Penn that yesterday.  No, no.  I don't even know.  No, I said it after we looked at his backstory that we have to go with this guy.  I did say that. 
[03:03:30]  I changed my opinion, even though he's a really good friend of ours.  But how do you not root for a guy like this?  Penn's a really good friend of mine, too, man.  Yeah, but Penn has a sex dungeon.  That's all he's got going for him.  How is the Midwest going to appreciate a magician with a sex dungeon?  Right.  We're going all American with this one.  I wonder what bars they go to when you work on the oil wigs.  Don't you guys have, like, a group of bars you go and you get into a little flack with the local...  Didn't you see Armageddon?  What's wrong with you?  No, of course they do.  You didn't see Armageddon?  No.  A bunch of roughnecks out there in space?  I like those kind of movies.  Did you watch that, Tracy? 
[03:04:00]  Just go, get out of here.  I could have done that, stupid.  I could have done that.  No, it was one of the most ridiculous movies.  That's right.  We got real oil wigs.  We got Guy Fieri outside, too, so I don't know what to do.  Oh, Jesus.  I'll sit on the couch.  I saw him.  No.  I saw him the other day.  What are you guys doing?  Sheriff?  Colin, you can't do that.  I'm sitting right here.  That's Fieri's manager.  That's a big...  Look how big that is.  He's a big son of a bitch right there.  He might be taller than you, Tracy.  He is tall.  I met him yesterday.  He's taller than me.  Here's Guy Fieri.  Guy Fieri.  Rock and roll. 
[03:04:30]  AC-DC.  Yeah.  For those about to rock.  Right on his fucking chest, baby.  What's up, Guy?  Yeah.  Good to see you, buddy.  You know, Tracy?  I just met him the other day.  God, is he tall.  Yeah, he's tall.  Yeah, he's tall.  Yeah, your manager's pretty goddamn tall right there.  But he's not rocking a cowboy hat and boots.  Yeah.  True.  He's in Nikes and a golf shirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I saw him we met the other day, and what a great guy.  And you've hit the tour, man.  You've been all over.  Well, that's what they make you do when you have a new album come out. 
[03:05:00]  They make you go dance for Granny.  The girls were going nuts at that show at the other day.  I can imagine.  Like, hey, I'm here.  I'm cooking.  I'm making some food.  You were cooking at one of his shows?  I should have been cooking at one of his shows.  It would have been cooking.  No, we were...  We were doing one of the morning shows.  Oh, okay.  It was a pretty good time.  So we were standing out there grilling and talking about food and the whole thing, and  he's from Louisiana.  Knives.  We were talking about knives.  We were talking about knives.  You've got to respect the guy that's got his own line of cutlery.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were just looking at that. 
[03:05:30]  Knuckle sandwich knives.  That's all right.  What a great name.  He's got flames on him.  Big sharp blade.  Right, Colin?  Great name for his knives.  Yes, indeed.  Guy, do you remember when we met?  Austin, Texas.  Really?  Colin Quinn?  Colin makes a face like, nah.  You recognize me.  Austin, Texas.  He's so proud of himself that he remembered something.  Did you see that?  That look on his face.  That was awesome.  He had a senior moment.  He was like, I remembered something.  Come on.  I know exactly.  Senior moment.  Magnolia bakery treats, Guy. 
[03:06:00]  CQ.  Who else?  Magnolia bakery treats.  You also switched spots with Tom Papa.  Yeah, I think Tom felt a little like, you know.  Tom should be on the couch, quite frankly.  No, I, yeah.  I was like, Colin Quinn was to be up there.  But Guy and I go way back also.  I want an expert opinion.  Oh, try some of that ice cream.  Get up here, man.  I don't care if y'all try it.  I want him to try it.  Yeah, exactly.  He's an expert.  Try the maple.  He's the expert.  What is this called?  Moonshine mashup?  See, I tell you, if there would have been a little moonshine in this, I think these are 
[03:06:30]  great.  Well, we know.  Yo, the mad Cuban's in here, too.  Oh, you're an alcoholic, so.  The mad Cuban.  We love him.  He's a character.  You were the one who introduced us to him, and now he does our show.  That's maple-y.  It has a butterscotch-y taste to it.  It's very good.  And it's good.  And it's pretty good.  Yeah.  I hope you should try something.  Shut the front door.  You know, and I just thought, you know, Penn, he did, he went way out there and mixed vanilla  and chocolate.  I did a maple macadamia, which my young lady, they called her an ice cream wizard. 
[03:07:00]  She said that, as far as she knew, that hadn't been done.  I'll tell you, I had Penn's yesterday, and he's got salt in his.  He's got a sea salt.  A little sea salt in it.  With salt and the counterbalance to the sugar.  I mean, it really plays nicely.  And he had big chunks of chocolate in it, kind of a bittersweet chocolate.  But I'm not a huge chocolate guy.  Oh.  This right here reminds me of, like, pralines and cream. 
[03:07:30]  That macadamia that survives in there.  A lot of times the nuts kind of get, you know, they kind of get crushed, and they're a little  soft, and they don't have any texture.  This has great texture.  It's not overly sweet.  You think maple, and I'm like, oh boy, someone's going to go crazy with the Mrs. Butterworth.  But this has got a good balance, man.  She kept coming to me, and I would say, come on, give me some more maple.  And she kept cranking up the maple intensity.  And I thought I may have gone a little too far with it.  You think it's all right?  It's almost too much.  Can you ship this to people's houses? 
[03:08:00]  I mean, or can you only buy Dwayne Reed?  Dwayne Reed and Walgreens, yeah.  Is it only in New York they carry it?  No, it's everywhere.  I'm nationwide, dude.  What's up?  National, right?  Nationwide.  Hell yeah.  Nationwide.  God damn, is that a great song?  Tell us about the new album that's coming out.  I got a new album out.  It's called Love Will.  And it's just nothing but love songs.  I've never done that before yet.  Oh, yeah.  Love Will dot, dot, dot.  There you go.  Thank you, guy.  Yeah, man. 
[03:08:30]  Guy knows.  Did you do that?  The first time I'd ever done that.  We just started playing your songs yesterday.  I didn't set out to do it, really.  I thought I had the album done in August.  And then this Apprentice thing came up.  And I whored out and went and did that.  So I couldn't come out in the fall with the album like I thought I was going to.  So we had to delay the release of it.  And in the meantime, I came up with a few more songs.  And I recorded them.  And then I realized that I had 11 love songs.  I had about 18, 19 songs cut. 
[03:09:00]  And I thought, wow, 11 of these are love songs.  So I'm just going to put out an album of love songs.  But it's not like a bread album.  I mean, don't think that it's that.  Because you've got to keep in mind, I'm the guy that thinks Badonkadonk is a love song.  Right, yes.  You know, keep.  Yeah.  But I will say this.  This album is a deal closer.  You know, if you've got.  And she's not cooperating.  And spend an evening with her.  Put this album on and close the deal.  Sounds like Fast Times at Ridgefown. 
[03:09:30]  Or let her go.  Yeah.  Must have been somebody's baby.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is getting plowed again.  Every time that goddamn song came out.  And it took out.  So did anything change in your life where you're like, ah, I love songs.  Let me jot a few of these down.  No, you know, I don't.  Not consciously.  I don't.  But maybe there's something going on.  You know, I think.  I don't want to get all into that stuff, man.  But I suppose there's a time in a man's life when he starts staring mortality in the face. 
[03:10:00]  And, you know, and you start realizing.  Geez, what was that for you?  Like 10?  Based on your bio?  Holy shit.  No, I always thought I was indestructible.  Now I kind of know that I'm not.  Yeah, that kind of sucks.  A shot in the heart does that to a man.  Yeah, man.  Who said that?  Oh, the couch.  Oh, my Tom.  Oh, my Tom.  Oh, my Tom.  I'm relaxing on the couch.  I can't even see.  He's at the kid table.  I couldn't stand to see Colin Quinn, after watching his show last night, sitting on the 
[03:10:30]  couch.  I couldn't stand to see Colin Quinn.  I can't have the legend be on the couch.  Tom, you should have seen when Mark Cuban and Bill Burr was in the air sitting on that  couch.  It was ridiculous.  You were just being pounded.  That was terrible.  Now you're just name dropping Mark Cuban.  Wow.  If I had a fucking Desert Eagle that day, there'd be no Mark Cuban.  Oh, wow.  Damn.  Or Opio Bill Burr.  And, of course, Guy, Guy Fieri, you have a book with, like, the longest title ever.  What is that?  Do I have to read all the signs?  No, don't read all the signs.  Oh, it's New York Times bestselling author, Guy Fieri. 
[03:11:00]  Just listen to that.  That's the first sign.  Then it goes to the next one.  And it's Diners, Drive-Ins, Dives, The Funky Finds in Flavortown.  America's Classic Joints and Killer Comfort Food includes behind the scenes stories and  jocularities from the Triple D crew and restaurant owners.  Cut me, Mick.  Cut me.  Wow.  Cut me, Mick. 
[03:11:30]  I'm going to use dot, dot, dot next time.  I swear it.  That is...  Listen, I don't know about these publishers.  Just put it in a search engine.  These publishers, yeah, exactly.  That's exactly what it is.  Get every tagline, every phrase you can.  What might be associated with it?  Oh, but another book guy, man.  I'll tell you what it is.  How many is this?  This is my fourth book, but my third diner's book.  And we've done like 600 locations on Triple D.  And so people ask, like, you know, how do we find the places and get us a map and do this?  So we just eventually...  I mean, this is like two years later for the third book. 
[03:12:00]  So you could literally take a little trip, a little road trip, and stop in at some of  these jerks?  In the back of it, it gives you the address and the website and all the...  Nice.  We have people that are traveling.  I mean, I've run into folks when I'm out there doing the show that have done like 300,  400 locations.  I'm like, what are you...  Wow.  I mean, they've got like RV...  They're doing more locations than I am.  And then they're bringing me portfolios of other places I should try.  I'm like, no, no, no.  Get ahead of the wave.  I mean, just let me go at my own...  Hey, you know, we're doing this fall.  We're taking a bus trip, a tour bus from here, from New York, down to where are we 
[03:12:30]  ended up?  Branson, Missouri, Nashville.  But we're going through Branson.  That's right.  Because we have to check out...  Even though I think Yonko's not going to be there.  But check out the Barry Williams 70s song explosion in Crabacanda.  It's a long story.  Was there a Yakov Smirnoff reference in there?  I think Yakov...  That's why we're going.  Seriously?  Did I just hear Yakov Smirnoff?  That's Yakov.  That's why we're going.  He's got a diner theater.  I saw him in Vegas when I was in college.  Trace is just shaking his head.  Hey, guy, I want to ask you something.  Yes, sir.  You know, the magazines on airplanes and they've got the list of the 10 best steakhouses in 
[03:13:00]  America.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I know.  But those people pay.  Do these people pay you to be in this book?  No, but jeez, you started getting WWF on me.  Let me ask you a question.  Let me listen to me, brother.  I'm going to break it down.  Hi, brother.  No.  Did you see how he turned around?  I'm like, no, yes, yes, maybe.  I don't know.  I don't think.  I kind of like seeing somebody fucking alpha male in your ass at some point.  I'm telling you.  You just saw me start to serve the ice cream.  He's like, let me ask you something. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey.  Suspended.  He turned around right in your face.  Man, I'll suss you.  I'll hook this suss in your nose and you're in deep trouble, my friend.  No, we don't take any.  I'll suss hook you, man.  We don't take any bribes as far as you know.  That's some good shit, Quinn.  I never even thought of that.  I'm going to suss hook you, boy.  All I know is he's got his pinky curled up like he's going to gas somebody in the nose 
[03:14:00]  with it.  I might have missed that piece.  Yeah.  We're going with Trace to win Celebrity Apprentice.  I might have to.  And Pendulet's a front part.  I don't know.  Boy, we are really fit.  Tell me about this road trip, by the way.  I want to hear about this.  I know.  We're just jumping on a bus.  So we're going to be stopping at a few places.  You know anywhere?  Where's a good place along the way?  Give us an example.  I will set up, you guys just give me the itinerary, I will set up the feeding zone, and we'll 
[03:14:30]  weigh you at the beginning of the event.  Like McCluskey at his dinner with Mike at Branson.  We'll put three of those Branson, Missouri buffets under your belt.  Nice.  You guys will be.  Do you know, I hear Yakov's place, Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  What happens is, he gives you a real metal tray that has a magnet on the back, and it sticks  on the seat, because when you watch Yakov's Dinner Theater, it's in movie theater seats.  You're literally sitting in movie theater seats.  So they have magnets on the arm.  You click your metal tray, but, don't get discouraged, genuine linen napkins, real silverware. 
[03:15:00]  No, you get a spork.  I know you get a spork.  No, real, this is what they actually pitch on the website.  They're advertising this shit.  That they have real linen napkins, real silverware, and a chicken cordon bleu.  Which I'm sure is just being pumped out of there like the chocolate on that Lucy conveyor  belt.  Yeah.  You're going old school with that.  Yeah.  What's for Jerry's Jubilee?  Jerry's Jubilee.  Right.  I want to bake the last year. 
[03:15:30]  We are very excited about that.  So how long will the trip take?  A week.  About a week.  We're just going to do Memphis.  Nashville.  Oh, we got some good.  Austin.  I got some good food.  We're going to Austin.  I got great.  Austin, great food.  Memphis, great food.  Nashville, great food.  I got a barbecue joint right outside of Nashville.  Can we just walk in and go, Cafieri sent us.  Rock and roll.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're going to try to set it up to that degree.  Like cakes and shit.  No, this will be good stuff.  How many people in your crew?  What's your policy going to look like?  Is this going to be like rubber ducky convoy? 
[03:16:00]  Not including the broads that we're going to get on the bus.  The broads.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, sure.  I'll sleep by fucking 930 at night.  The policy is going to look like.  You ever see that?  See the stuff at the gas station?  And one flew over the Cooper's neck.  That's my thing.  It's going to look like convoy, you know, with all these dilapidated rigs behind you.  It's going to be pretty shitty.  People flashing you when they drive by on the bus.  I'm hoping to get maybe a couple of CBs so we can talk to each other.  That would be nice.  Going old school.  CBs would be a nice touch.  Hey, buddy.  I was the wrangler.  Are you going to bring the hardware? 
[03:16:30]  That's right.  What?  Are you going to bring the hardware?  I don't think I can bring my piece.  Why not?  Eh, you cross state lines.  Everything's fucked up.  It's not Smokey and the Bandit.  You can't do that.  I had one on the bus one time I forgot about.  It was in my nightstand by my bed.  And then we crossed the border going into Canada.  And they put me in jail.  Oh, they did lock you up?  Yeah, they locked me up for six hours.  They locked me up for about six hours.  Shouldn't they know?  How do they come on and handcuff you is what I want to know.  No shit.  Well, who's the job is that?  Let's get on there and get him.  No, I copped to it immediately because it was like border crossing trainee day. 
[03:17:00]  And so they were just like going through everything.  Oh, man.  So I immediately said, okay, wait.  I forgot about something.  And then I told them where it was.  And then they just...  Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.  Shouldn't they take things like that into consideration and know that it's like, look, it's Trace  Atkins.  He's not going to fucking be blasting off in Canada with this gun.  It was an honest mistake.  You know, as opposed to somebody you know is trying to commit some kind of real crime.  It was weird.  And then when they gave me my pistol, it was a little .380 automatic. 
[03:17:30]  It wasn't a big deal.  But they handed it back to me and they had completely disassembled it.  So it was just all in pieces.  Kept souvenir parts.  I had to walk back across the border and mail it home.  They wouldn't let me drive back across.  Wow.  Wow.  So now do you have a weapons charge on you in Canada or something?  No.  But that's why they really got mad because I had a weapons charge here.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I like the fact that every question Trace answers is like another story.  Really?  It just leads to another whole story. 
[03:18:00]  Pandora's box just.  Yeah.  I love it, man.  We were shipping the Camaro we use for Triple D across the border.  And I'd just been at a, it just was at Kid Rock's place doing a shoot for Triple D.  Oh, God.  And we loaded it up.  We loaded it up at home.  Uh-oh.  You don't like the beer or you don't like Rock?  They found guns and dope and women in the trunk of the car.  So we loaded up.  He makes this great beer.  He makes this great beer.  And we had it on the show and I wanted to take some back to California, so I threw it  in the trunk of my Camaro. 
[03:18:30]  Well, I just happened to forget the Camaro was on its way to Canada.  So I get a call from this driver stressing out, there's beer in the back of your car.  Where the hell did that come from?  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, shit.  But they actually, they let it go.  They let the car come into Canada, cruise around with the 10 cases and cruise back out.  Oh, okay.  Did they know it was that?  No weapons charge.  No weapons.  Yeah.  You got to watch that.  I hate the fact that, you know, you go from one state to another and fucking your gun's good  here, it's not good here.  You're responsible and we trust you and you went through all the hoops here.  Like in New York, you got to go through so much. 
[03:19:00]  I should be able to cover every goddamn state in the Union.  But, you know, I can't drive across Jersey unless it's in a locked box, separate from  the ammo.  You're not stopping until you get to Pennsylvania.  You know, shit like that.  Which is really stupid because then if someone steals the car, instead of the gun being on  you where you have possession of it and know where it is and it's not going to get  in anyone else's hands, now someone's got your gun and your car.  The laws make no sense.  They punish the law-abiding citizen, do nothing to make anyone safer. 
[03:19:30]  Where is this coming from?  I've never heard you talk like this before.  Exactly, Kyle.  Do you know what?  A New Yorker just got arrested because of the new law that only allows seven rounds in  your magazine.  And he had ten because he had a ten-round magazine.  Right, right, right.  And he got pulled over.  He had a pistol on his seat, a state.  He pulled him over and looked, saw the gun.  The guy says, yes, I'm completely legal.  I got this.  The trooper checked the magazine, found that there were, you know, three more too many  bullets or two.  I think it was a nine-round magazine that he had, so it was only two extra bullets, and 
[03:20:00]  arrested him.  And now the guy's got a weapons charge on him because of that.  How did that make anyone any safer?  How did that law just make New York a safer place to live?  Because a guy that legally owns a gun, has all the permit, had two bullets too many in  his magazine.  I mean, the laws are ridiculous.  Talk your boy Cuomo.  Yeah, well, he's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one.  The gun charge I had was a similar kind of thing.  I wasn't doing anything illegal.  Right.  How?  How did it? 
[03:20:30]  I had a pistol, and it was in the pocket of the door of my truck.  Uh-huh.  And at the time, I didn't have a permit, carry permit.  Uh-oh.  But anyway, so the pistol was there in the door, and it was loaded, of course.  And I got pulled over for something else, and the guy looks, and he goes, is that gun  loaded?  And I said, is your gun loaded?  Yeah, it's loaded.  You know?  I carried the gun.  Paperweight.  There are two useless things in this world, a dull knife and an empty gun, you know?  I love it.  So, he said, assumed the position, and took me directly to jail. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  But that's my gun charge.  I mean, I didn't, you know, I didn't like it.  What state was that?  What state was that?  That was Tennessee.  Tennessee.  Wow.  Now I have a carry permit.  Tennessee.  In Tennessee.  So they're all cool with it.  If you hook up, like, fucking Ted Nugent, they, like, deputize him, and he could carry  anywhere in the country.  A bazooka.  You gotta get that.  Well, I like the fact that Trace doesn't think he's getting arrested.  He's like, hey, officer, there's two useless things in this world, a dull knife and an unloaded  gun. 
[03:21:30]  Instead of going, it's loaded, sir, but I'm on my way.  You're free to go.  What did you tell him?  Hey, fuck you.  You're not gonna do nothing about it.  It's loaded.  No, he did.  He asked me, he said, is that gun loaded, sir?  And I said, hell, is your gun loaded?  You know what I mean?  Come on, man.  Yes, loaded.  Absolutely.  Why wouldn't you have to load it?  Six steps out of the truck.  What, I look like I'm in a Liberace movie?  Hey, hey, hey.  I got caught stealing bubble yum once.  And they put me in the back, and my dad had to come get me. 
[03:22:00]  Wow, that is frightening.  Hard turn.  Trace has lived the life here, man.  The whole, the work ethic, the getting hurt on a real man's job.  Right.  The country music star, weapons charges, Jesus Christ.  Nothing's more disturbing than I've heard today than the fact that you guys are going  on this weekly road trip.  I sure like it.  Just to mix it up.  It's unnerving to me.  Oh, I think it'd be fun.  We're gonna invite you, Carl.  What's the theme?  Why are you going there?  We're gonna stop at various places that we normally don't go to. 
[03:22:30]  We normally go, like, Boston and D.C. and stuff to hang out with fans and stuff.  And then we'll tell people in advance where we're gonna be.  And these fans from various areas are gonna come up, and we're gonna, like, tailgate in  some parking lots, have some fun, you know, shit like that.  This is gonna be like a Spinal Tap in store, man.  Nobody's coming.  So our fans, so when fans see the buses, they're gonna be...  Their fan base in Branson is huge.  Yeah, we're a little full of ourselves. 
[03:23:00]  Are people gonna fall again?  Who knows?  We don't know.  Hopefully not.  We don't know.  This is gonna be a cluster.  Oh, of course.  It's awesome.  It's a Spinal Tap in store.  It's just, you know...  You know, we like to think of it as a more...  What did he say?  It's like a more intimate setting.  You know, you're used to playing these 20,000-seat arenas.  Now you're playing, you know, some 4,000-seat venues.  Well, it's more of an intimate atmosphere.  I like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Kick my ass. 
[03:23:30]  Kick my ass.  Is Norton going too?  Yes.  I think so.  Jim Norton will be attending.  Are you all riding on the same bus with the same honey bucket?  Two buses.  You gotta film the whole bus.  Oh, he's bus and my bus.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You gotta film this whole thing.  Come on.  Oh, of course.  We're gonna.  We're absolutely filming the whole thing.  I got Troy Kwan on my bus, so he's bringing the bitches, as he says.  I'm gonna get us some bitches, Troy said.  Who's got stupid Sam on their bus?  Sam?  That's Sam.  Whose bus are you gonna be on?  I haven't been drafted yet.  Now, you're not really known as a partying guy. 
[03:24:00]  My bus is gonna be pretty much the party bus.  Yeah.  And then Opie's gonna be the, you know, married guy and stuff.  He doesn't party like crazy anymore.  So, you want the bus with...  The bitches.  The baby monitor or the bitches?  The bitches.  Bitches.  The bitches.  He goes bitches.  Oh, girls love being called bitches, don't they?  It's fantastic.  How are we gonna tell Penn Jillette that we're not rooting for him anymore?  I know.  Should we call him? 
[03:24:30]  I'm all about, I'm all in with Trace now.  And this is fantastic.  Yeah, look.  It's trying the ice cream.  Now it's a little mushy.  See, it's wonderful.  Oh, that's good.  We probably should take a break.  You know what?  Get Trace out.  I gotta go anyway.  This would be good on Waffles.  This would be great on Waffles.  I gotta go to Atlantic City and hang out with my peeps.  Atlantic City, where do you stay when you go there?  I don't stay anywhere there.  I go.  I go there and...  In and out.  I go there and they give me money and I leave.  Oh, okay.  I gotta go do a show tonight at Caesars there. 
[03:25:00]  Caesars in L.A.C.  Can we play one of your new songs?  That'd be cool.  I didn't come over here just to talk to you.  No, we're gonna do it, though.  He throws a smack down.  No matter what he says, you're that close from getting punched in the face.  He is.  He's a very intimidating guy.  Authentic.  Say no to a woman or watch the world end.  Say no to a woman.  All right, we're gonna do that for two seconds.  Watch the world ends.  It's a really sappy love song I did with Colby Calais.  It's beautiful, but it's not good for this show. 
[03:25:30]  You know, I don't think any...  Nothing beautiful is good for this show.  I don't know if any of the songs on this album are good for this show.  You should go back and do something off one of my other albums.  Whoop a man's ass or something like that.  We played Arlington yesterday.  Oh, did you?  That's a tear jerk.  What the fuck?  A lot of people commented that they were bawling.  Yeah, that's a tear jerk, that song.  We played another one.  What was the other one?  Honky Tonk Badonky Donk.  No, we played that.  Of course.  Well, that's a love song.  That's pretty sensitive.  Of course it is.  I mean, especially when the moneymaker line comes by. 
[03:26:00]  You know, it really brings a tear.  What was the third one we played?  As a father of five daughters, that one really.  Oh, shit.  You got five daughters?  Yeah.  Wow.  Good luck with that.  And I've had people say, well, why do you have five daughters?  Because I wanted to have one son.  And after the fifth one, I didn't even leave the hospital.  I just walked down and I said, dude, you've got to do something about this, man.  That's it, huh? 
[03:26:30]  That was it.  Man.  Wow.  How old are they?  How old are the girls?  28, 24, 15, 11, and 8.  All right.  So you've had to deal with guys coming up.  All of you.  How is that for a dad?  I've just never had a problem with some of my life.  Of course, you're 6'4".  Hello.  Man, that would suck.  Man, you meet a girl, you're liking her and stuff, and it's like, oh, let me introduce  you to my dad.  Oh, yeah.  Who's he?  Oh, yeah.  By the way, my dad's Trace Hankin.  You're like, oh, my God.  He's a giant.  He doesn't put up with shit. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  He wants to wrestle you in the backyard.  Yeah.  Right.  Just don't fucking stay away from his pinky.  He'll put it in your nose.  Yeah.  Don't let him suss hook you.  Oh, my God, King.  He's going for the suss hook.  That's going to be my wrestling go-to move, man.  I'm going to do some WWE, man.  There it is.  There you go.  Go to the suss hook.  Trace, thanks so much for coming in.  Absolutely.  What a pleasure, man.  It was a pleasure to meet you guys.  It was a lot of fun.  I've been a fan for a long time. 
[03:27:30]  It's great, man.  Thanks, man.  Colin Quinn.  Wow.  Colin.  Thank you.  Liberace.  Liberace in the corner.  Tom Papa.  Got you.  I think it's Tom Papa.  My old friend.  We'll do a little extra today.  Tell me.  We'll come back.  We'll come back for Dice Fury.  It's Rockstar, man.  You did it.  It's good, isn't it?  It's dynamite.  We're talking about the ice cream.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's saying that my maple macadamia match looks good.  It's not too sweet.  It's got great nuts.  Wow.  That's not the first time I've been told about that.  I've had a nickel for every time I've heard that. 
[03:28:00]  You've got great nuts.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Chase.  We're going to go to break with Chase Atkins, and we'll continue with Guy Fieri, Colin Quinn,  and Tom Papa.  Stay there.  I wouldn't own a suit, much less a tie. 
[03:28:30]  Sunday would still be a part of Friday night, and Jesus wouldn't be a friend of mine if I could  say no to a woman.  I never would have chased that crazy dream. 
[03:29:00]  Those kind of odds would have seemed too long for me.  I'd have had to settle for plan B if I could say no to a woman.  She saw me better than I thought I was.  She offered her heart and all her love.  And I don't know where I'd be today if I could say no to a woman. 
[03:29:30]  I bet I wouldn't live in a little suburb house.  I probably wouldn't be somebody's daddy now.  And they wouldn't be all I'd think about if I could say no to a woman. 
[03:30:00]  Well, she saw me better than I thought I was.  She offered her heart and all her love.  And I don't know where I'd be today.  And she saw me better than I really was. 
[03:30:30]  And all she wanted was all my love.  And she saw me better than I thought I was.  She offered her heart and all her love.  And I don't know where I'd be today. 
[03:31:00]  Can I tell the truth?  She makes it hard to say no to a woman.  I can't say no to that woman.  I can't say no to that woman.  I can't say no to that woman. 
[03:31:30]  I can't say no to that woman.  The Opie and Anthony Show on SiriusXM.  Drink it up, get up, drink it up, my friend  Drink up, drink up, drink up the Obama Kool-Aid  I'm in chains, I'm in chains 
[03:32:00]  My freedom of speech is in chains  I'm the one in chains now  I'm in chains, because I can't say what I want to say  Let me know, how long do we pay  Wouldn't you rather have, a guy holding a gun on you  Or a guy that's about to hold a gun on you  Let me know, because we're having a gun held on us right now 
[03:32:30]  Right now, right now  We're having a gun held on us right now  Stop it, once you vote white you know you vote right  Right, right, what?  Can I wear one of those out and not be beaten to a pole  It's time for Whitey to realize  We don't have to be victims anymore  I'm in chains, I'm in chains  My freedom of speech is in chains  I'm the one in chains now 
[03:33:00]  I'm in chains, because I can't say what I want to say  Let me know, how long do we pay  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold  I hope it's icy cold  Drink it up my friend  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid  How long do we pay  How long do we pay  Before people fucking act like  Human fucking beings  I'm in chains 
[03:33:30]  I'm in chains  My freedom of speech is in chains  I'm the one in chains now  I'm in chains  Because I can't say what I want to say  Let me know, how long do we pay  I'm fucking exhausted  I'm going to need a nap  Sirius XM  This is the OPN at 3 Show  I'm on the highway to hell 
[03:34:00]  They're talking  I just want to say it really fast  The only reason we're staying late was  Because of Trace Atkins  He was so much fun  It gave us like this great vibe  How cool is he?  It's that country guy  Right  That country guy thing  He's got his sayings  And he's just funny, man  We talk about it  He's a man's man  That is what you call a man's man  He's a man's fucking man  That's a man's man  Not like the fucking faggots  Trace Atkins, Colin Quinn 
[03:34:30]  He's a man's man  Did we make you proud?  We didn't change our personalities too much  At the beginning  It got a little fawning  Everybody coward  It did get a little fawning  But everybody coward  Yeah, yeah, we did coward  But how can you not?  How can you not?  Well, he's like  Who's the one that doesn't like my maple?  That's great  We all said we hated maple  I felt like I was seven years old  And we said  Who's that guy on the couch  From Liberace?  Liberace  Oh, yeah  I'm going to go home now 
[03:35:00]  Where's the Liberace guy?  Now, you can screw up maple really easy  There's that  Crown Royal came out with a maple Crown Royal  Right  And it's just a little too maple-y for me  And I like Crown Royal  But this right here  There's a good balance  I mean, someone was involved  In doing this the right way  This could have really been jacked up  No, he's just like  Put more maple in there  That would have been more fun  If they let those guys do everything  Yeah  And don't direct them  Yeah  But they're obviously an ice cream expert type person  I want to make Jack Daniels beef jerky ice cream 
[03:35:30]  That's what I'm doing  That's what I'm doing  For a treat, you find a bullet in it  Copenhagen and Cornhudge  Yeah, I thought Tom was in bad taste when he heckled Trace about getting shot  Yeah  Yeah, the heckle from the couch about him getting shot  Why is Trace still standing outside?  He doesn't scare me  What did he say?  What did he say, Carl?  He was like, yeah, Trace, good one  As it happens to you, he's shot in a heart  Oh, wow  Wow  Yeah, yeah, Tom  It wasn't like that 
[03:36:00]  You took that Liberace stuff a little too seriously  I felt like I had to do something bold from the couch  Something pressing over there  You gotta sit over there on the couch  You feel like a fan  Guy didn't even see me  I know, Guy didn't even see me  I was over there like a muskrat  It is terrible  And he's sitting there the whole time going  This asshole Colin Quinn told me to get on the fucking F train for this shit  Colin didn't talk them into coming here today  But I really couldn't stand seeing Colin on the couch  I'm like, I'll take the hit  Thank you  That's the last time with Opie 
[03:36:30]  That was ridiculous  Byron Mark Cuban  It was a horrible situation  Yeah, and he liked you  Trace, really  He's a fan  He knew Long Story Short  Yeah, of course he is  Of course he is  I would have been the funny guy in the old rig  Oh, you'd have been the hoot  You'd have been like the Buscemi character in Armageddon  You know, the funny guy  Not really doing much of the work  Doing shadow puppets with his detached finger  Well, we keep him on the rig  Because he keeps morale up  Yeah  We're CQ 
[03:37:00]  Can't spin a pipe worth of shit  But, man  You fucked it up again, Quinn  Quinn  We could just talk about Trace all weekend  Oh, fucking Trace  But he's so much more fun  The energy without Jim Norton  Oh  It's not attack on Jim  It's just he brings a certain  What do I want to say?  Toxicity  Do you think there's a negativity that comes with Jim Norton on the program?  Carl, he's going to fucking unfollow your ass again 
[03:37:30]  Again  Yeah, the unfollowing scandal is still not resolved, by the way  I think there's still some bad blood there  There's a lot of bad blood there  That has to be really resolved  Jim Norton unfollowed on Twitter  Did he make a public appearance about it?  No  From all followers  All mutual followers  He literally unfollowed me for a month  Before I found out  And then he tried to lump Colin in  With a bunch of people that he unfollowed  He goes, no, I was just unfollowing everybody  And he goes, I'm not mad  It was just, fuck everybody 
[03:38:00]  I was like, man  That doesn't sound too mad  Oh my god  Wait, Jesus Christ  We went late  He's mentally ill  We went late because of Guy Fieri  And now they're saying you've got to leave  Wait a second  I went late because of me  This is the only reason we're still on the air  I was here for the, you know, for the comedy hour  It was country comedy hour  It was fun  Where are you going?  Where are you going now?  I don't know  I gotta go back to California tonight  No, look at Roland, he's scared  Like, we've got to get him out of here  He's probably going to the boneyard  He's scared because his manager is 6'7  He's doing the mashup  Oh, he's doing the mashup 
[03:38:30]  You're doing the mashup  You can stay here, don't worry about it  I just fucked the mashup  I thought it was like the Today Show or something  No, he's doing the mashup  Oh, fuck those guys  You're cool  You're good  Carl?  Everybody's jacked up on shit  His manager's huge  Yeah, yeah, yeah  His manager's bigger than Trace  How tall is he?  6'8  That's 6'8, huh?  He's 6'8  Special golf clubs, the whole thing, man  He's a  Wow  He's one of his buddies from the Humboldt County gang  He's from Humboldt County  So we don't want to get him out of here  I knew  As soon as I told you that 
[03:39:00]  I knew that was going to come out  I saw that sparkle in his eye  I'm like, oh, God  It's for the fishing and the local nature  Of course  It's for the redwoods  I knew that was going to get me  Do we really got to get him out of here, Roland?  Yeah, we got to get out of here anyway  Who are we kidding?

[03:40:00]  Sounds great  That'd be a party  That'd be fun  Holy fuck, this is turning into something  Well, we could get bail  Well, I can line up bail money in the different states  You know, that'll be necessary  You got a band?

[03:48:30]  What  I don't know what that means  What does he mean  Huh  What's up call  You got catering for the tour  We do now  Guy Fieri  Catering the big bus tour  You gotta live your life  Like a turtle  Without a shell  What  Huh  What  Like having a six gun  With three bullets  And a hedgehog  On your foot  What  What  I don't get it  I know it means something  Like an eagle  Walking in a hen house  With one hook  Of course it is 
[03:49:00]  Of course it is  But what  Alright kids  Goodnight everybody  What a lot of fun  Take it easy  Stay tuned for the five minutes  Of the Sam Roberts  After show  Thanks Tom  Thanks Tom  The Opie and Anthony show  Is available later today  With Sirius XM  On demand  You've heard about it  You've waited  Four long hours  For it  And now the moment  You've waited for  Rears its ugly nose  Head  After Opie and Anthony  Live  Is coming up next 
[03:49:30]  And now the Opie and Anthony  Show continues  This is After Opie and Anthony  Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Yes  Opie's packing up his gifts  They're really heavy  Here on After Opie and Anthony  Live  I just tweeted  What was in the  The  The boxes 
[03:50:00]  That Paul Anka sent  It's ridiculous  What a show today  Huh  Where's my  Where's the card  Yeah I think you put it  In your pocket  The crystal  I'm going to throw away  But I want to save  The handwritten note  You're going to throw away  The whole thing  That Paul Anka sent you  I threw away wedding gifts  Just like this  So it was taking up  Too much room  You can't find someone  To give that to  Or sell it to somebody  Or  I mean those are nice pieces  Well I was very careful  How I  Can I give them away  On the after show  No I'm going to  I'm going to  Re  Re gift  Re gift  And give it as a wedding present 
[03:50:30]  So when Paul Anka  Is back here on Tuesday  He's not going to see those  Huh  Should we set it up nice for him  I think so  Yeah  I think  You can even leave it here  Set it up nice  Put some juice in there  Put the glasses out  A little fresh orange juice  A little fresh squeezed OJ  A little vodka on the side  Just in case he wants  A little vodka  In case he wants a sniff  We're not going to stop him  From that  What'd you do buddy  That was a fun show today  Holy fuck was that fun  That was a lot of fun  It's easy to bitch 
[03:51:00]  About this place  Maybe we should start talking  When the place is a lot of fun  Like today was  Right  Today was a lot of fun  I don't know  I think Guy Fieri's mad at me  Or something  I got a very weird vibe  From him today  With you guys  He was all good  He didn't even know  You were in the room Sam  He absolutely did  Because I'm the one  Who brought him in  He didn't know  All I know is  He's now catering  The big bus tour  Yeah now you think  It's going to happen  Yeah I believe him  You believe who  Management  I believe  Oh no  I don't believe management 
[03:51:30]  That's what I mean  But I believe  If the bus tours  Actually happen  That Guy Fieri  Is going to cater  To the whole thing  Of course  I believe Guy  But then that implies  That you believe  That the bus tour  Is happening  Yeah  He was this close  To going into  My brother's  Fucking restaurant  Why didn't he  That would give  My brother even more cred  Guy Fieri's in there  Are you kidding me  Because then the word  Would get out in Huntington  Like holy fuck  Guy Fieri was hanging out  At FH Riley's  In the heart of Huntington Village  400 New York Avenue  Now first of all  I got it  Second of all  One of his flunkies  Was in there  The mad Cuban  All you had was the Cuban 
[03:52:00]  And nobody says a word  When the Cuban shows up  But if Guy's in there  He's very recognizable  That would get around  Of course  He walks around  And flip flops  If 40 degrees  That close  Man there's some blonde guy  With sunglasses  On the back of his head  That's gotta be Guy Fieri  And then I'm telling you  They talk in that town  And then people would  Go to the restaurant  Just because he was in it  That's how that shit works  What was he talking about  Four or five restaurants  In Huntington  There's one restaurant  To worry about  No I don't care  Well he doesn't need  To be going to  Any other restaurants 
[03:52:30]  No if he  If he like  Revolves the whole show  Around FH Riley  But then he looks at  Some of the other joints  That's cool  I don't give a fuck  Yeah but he's gotta  Go into those joints  And be like  Wow this is shitty  Compared to that last one  Oh this is also shitty  You know what's great though  What?  My brother Brett  Wouldn't care  He wouldn't?  He would basically be saying  Hey man this Guy Fieri  Is in my way  Does he not realize  How important it is  For business?  He don't care  He doesn't  Nah he doesn't give a fuck  Is he a chef by trade?  He actually turned down  Kitchen Nightmares 
[03:53:00]  Why?  Because he didn't want  To deal with Gordon Ramsay  Yeah he was like  Look I got a business  I'm running here  He could make more money though  He knows what he's doing though  I've been to the place  I don't know  It's not a Kitchen Nightmares  Type place  No  It might have turned him down  No but he  He basically said  It could only hurt me  Because he knows  What he's doing  Yeah  And that guy has to come in  And find all sorts of problems  Or the show doesn't work  And he's probably got  One of those huge tempers  On him right?  Big time  Which would have been great  Yeah it would have been  Great TV  Oh he's way worse than me 
[03:53:30]  He is?  Way worse  There would have been  There would have been  A physical altercation then  Him and Gordon Ramsay  Would have been great TV  But my brother's like  I don't have time for this  That's what he said  That's why I love him  He don't give a fuck  He doesn't give a fuck  About any of this  He's a chef by trade  Yeah  So he's got one of those  Real chef attitudes  Like I'm not one of these  Bullshit TV stars  The guy's gonna be  In my fucking way  I got you know  I got shit to make  Good  Good for him  They actually  Went really far in the process  And then my brother  Tapped out  They were like  Being considered 
[03:54:00]  It was down to him  And a couple other joints  And my brother  Like tapped out  He's like  I just don't want to do this  He didn't think  And then they called him up  Like really  Because we're really  Leaning toward you guys  He's like  Good for you  It wouldn't have hurt him  He's doing great  I know he's doing great  Yeah I can't even say  We would have been  Necessarily doing better  But it definitely  Wouldn't have hurt him  But a Guy Fieri  Hanging out at the bar  There's nothing bad about that  That would have ruled  Guy Fieri doesn't  Criticize anybody  No he would have just been  Doing like rock and roll moves  As my brother-in-law 
[03:54:30]  Is trying to serve  Fucking drinks  Kicking over appetizers  Just kick in  You know  Hey these wings are  Kicking  Wait did you say  Kicking over appetizers  Yeah  That means he would have to  Get his leg up  Pretty fucking high  Oh yeah he would  He doesn't get the leg  Up that high  He's not exactly DLR  No he knows how to do  The rock and roll kick  Right  You know  Just a lesser version of it  But you better put those  Advertisers on a little  Footstool if you want  To kick them over  Not a high top  He's going about  Ankle high with those kicks  Oh fuck it  Maybe if you put the 
[03:55:00]  Appetizers on the actual  Like chair you sit in  Right  He might be able to  Kick that over  He'd probably just  Kick the leg of the chair  And let the chair flip over  Guy Fieri isn't getting  That leg up high enough  To kick appetizers  Off a fucking table  I'll tell you right now  Yeah  FH Riley's  Who's here to rock  And off a bar  Not even possible  Nah  I got one menu item  A knuckle sandwich  It's Guy Fieri's time baby  You making fun of his  Knuckle sandwich knives  I am  Why would you do that  Not only is it  It's a great name  Look at him  He's branded 
[03:55:30]  Look at him  Look  What's wrong with Guy Fieri's book  Don't fucking blow up her spot  He's catering the bus tour  It's not just  Knuckle sandwich knives  He's got his little logo  Right here that says  Knuckle sandwich  Guy Fieri  Yeah that's his fucking thing  He's branding  Knuckle sandwich  Well maybe Opie and Anthony  Should start branding  Sam Roberts  Yeah well with something  Less corny than  Knuckle sandwich  We don't even have  A t-shirt out  And this guy's got  Fucking snake knives  Management made some  T-shirts for you guys  What?  Management  When?  They got him in the office  How dare they? 
[03:56:00]  Says the Opie and Anthony  Show Sirius XM  What did you say?  I can't  Your thing's not on  Turn them all on  There's girly shirts too  Isn't there?  Yeah and some girly shirts  We used to have thongs  But I think they're all gone though  A maple recipe  I thought  Yep maple bourbon sundae  Maple bourbon baby  That's from Flavortown  The maple bourbon sundae  Right in Guy Fieri's book  Get the drinks out  We're taking a trip  A one way trip  To Flavortown  So who here  Doesn't like maple ice cream  That was scary 
[03:56:30]  I just started looking around like  And I told Ant  While you were out of the room  Yeah  What a bunch of pussies  Once Trace Atkins  Walked in here  You guys did not say  That you hoped  Trace Atkins wins  You guys said  Penn Jillette would have  A tough time winning  And you still wanted him to win  You're liars  Nah I would pull the tape  I think officially after  You didn't know  You never said  Yesterday show  We basically said  Fuck Penn Jillette  They said earlier in the show  They didn't understand  Why their whole persona changes  When a guest is in  I didn't hear him 
[03:57:00]  He said that earlier in the show  You pointed out  That your whole persona changes  When a guest walks in  Yeah  That's what this was  At least we admit it  Yeah  He's a man's man  Who's going to get in his fucking way  When Guy Fieri walks in  It's like  Everybody's here to  Party  Rock and roll  He brings the party  He had an ACDC shirt on  He played right into  What we say about him  And then Ant looks right at him  He's inches away from his face  And he goes  Can we go into some of those places  And be like  Hey we're here with Guy Fieri 
[03:57:30]  Pew pew pew pew  He had an ACDC  For those about to rock t-shirts  I know  You called him out too  As soon as he walked in  Those about to rock  He's got the t-shirt  Alright guys  Oh Guy Fieri  Enjoy the episode  His food's good  He brought in the  Waldorf chicken sandwich  It's pretty fucking good  I gotta sneak out  Before I have the awkward  You know  Bumping into Fez thing  Why is that awkward  Is he gonna try to book you  For unmasked  Why do you say that Eric  What happened 
[03:58:00]  What did you say  What did you say  What do you mean  Because that's what he does  He hangs out  He just bumps into people  And tries to awkwardly  Book them for unmasked  Usually  Oh I had no idea  This was going on  Tell Ronnie I said hi though  Eric took a little shot  Tell him Fez  He said hi of course  Eric took  Eric took a little Fez shot  He said what's he gonna do  Try to book Opie for an unmasked  Eric taking some shots in there  What's up with that  It's been an aggressive day  It has been  Hasn't it  I don't know why  He's taking shots at Fez  He did a great job  He did a great job 
[03:58:30]  His fifth mic today  So stop it  I didn't hear him  I didn't realize  I didn't hear every part  Of the show though  So he might have done great  Fez was great  His fifth mic today  Look have a great weekend  Opie  Troy Kwan elevator show  Let's do it man  Elevator show  What about it  Starring Anthony Cook  Not not  I don't think  Wait  Got an elevator show  Starring Alan Thicc Jr  And the shaving of the eyebrows  Some extra footage  And uh  Rock and roll  I don't think  I don't think  It's starring Anthony Cumia  But he is in this week's episode  Of the elevator show 
[03:59:00]  That's a big get  Is it a cameo  It's a little more than a cameo  How long is he in the video for  I'm gonna give him co-starring  Whoa  Not starring  What about also featuring  Because if he's not in a lot  But he's in  He jumps in  You could say  Also featuring  Anthony Cumia  The video  Was about a minute  35  And was in for about  30 seconds  20  I'd say that's also featuring  I'm gonna give him co-starring  I don't know  That seems like a bit of an overstatement  To tell you the truth  It's on our Facebook page  Go there  Rock out 
[03:59:30]  And what are we gonna do  For the next elevator show  We have a couple ideas  Maybe we do something with Paul Anka  I was trying to bail on it  For a few weeks  He'll be willing to do it  Let it rest  And I can't  E-Bomb's World wants more episodes  Because they're good  Is Paul Anka gonna be like  This is not exactly old school  You know  Back in the day  We would never shoot a show  In an elevator  I think he's down  You think so?  Yeah he just seems like  He's just kinda  Desperate  Well  How about we do this  I  Alright this is what I  Picture 
[04:00:00]  Alright  Okay  Opening shot  Get into the mind  Opening shot  Full elevator  Just full of commuters  Yeah  All of a sudden you're hearing  Some fucking elevator music  Right  It's Paul Anka  He's perfect  What song are we singing?  I'm not really sure yet  But he's perfect  For the elevators right?  Fly me to  Yeah his music  Is playing elevators  And then the big reveal  He's actually singing  The fucking song  In the corner  Whoa  He should sing something  That he wouldn't  Normally sing though  In other words  Like get him to sing  The Love Boat theme  Love Boat theme 
[04:00:30]  Is a pretty sweet theme  As far as TV songs go  Yeah  It's up to you  That's right  Okay  We'll think so  We got till Tuesday right?  Tuesday  You'll be around  After Tuesday  After the show right?  And a lot of people  Are gonna say  Wasn't Paul Anka just in?  Why on earth  Would he be back on the show?  He wants to  I don't know what he's doing  With himself  He's sending Opie  Gifts now  We started the show  If you missed today's show  You gotta hear the whole thing  It'll be on demand  And all that bullshit  But  The Barry Williams thing  Is now a throwaway  Yeah  Yeah  You forgot all about that 
[04:01:00]  We started finding out  That Paul Anka  That was supposed to be  The highlight of today's show  Yeah  I go home going  Look at me with a big  Fucking highlight  Right  And now it's just a throwaway  Right  We started out with  Paul Anka  He's sending Opie gifts  And he sent  What's the bottle thing called?  It's escaping me  Oh  Cove?  Decatur  Decatur  Decanter  Decanter  Right?  Yeah  Decanter  And Decanter  And some glasses  Some alcohol glasses  Paul Anka  Is sending him gifts  And saying thanks  For a great time on the show  And then coming back 
[04:01:30]  On the show  Like a month  After he was just here  Then  Opie and me  Are talking about  His friendship  With Barry Williams  Greg Brady  From  The Brady Bunch  After not talking to him  For like  It's gotta be five years  Maybe  Probably more  More like probably  Five to ten years  I'll say  Opie just calls him  Out of the blue  It's six forty five  In the morning  Five forty five  In Branson  Where Greg Brady  Is right now  And A-Rock  Do you have the  The pick up 
[04:02:00]  Of the phone call?  I don't  Hang on  Okay  He picks up the phone  Cause we just hear it ringing  And we're like  Oh boy  What is going to happen here?  He picks up the phone  And we could swear  It's the voicemail  Opie's got him on speaker  So that's how he knew  He was on the air  Cause Opie's got him  On speaker  And he can hear us  All laughing  And making  Fun of what we thought  Was his voicemail message  But it's just the way  He picked up the phone  Because Opie  Woke him up  In the middle of a  Deep sleep 
[04:02:30]  They're just sitting there  In almost silence  Yeah  He's just like  Uh  Alright  Let's  This is how he picked up the phone  Say what?  So we think that's his  Super cool Greg Brady voicemail  But no  He just  Say what?  Why is Opie  Calling me after ten years  At five o'clock in the morning?  It needs to be on the replay machine  It does need to be on the replay machine  You know what?  Friday shows are becoming  My favorite shows of the week  Oh for sure  Yeah  I mean there's craziness  That happens on these Friday shows  And it's not like  Old  It's a different type of craziness 
[04:03:00]  Than the show used to be  It used to be  When you say craziness  It's  As we discussed on the show today  Women having sex  On a new carpet  Now it's just  Weird land  Yeah  But it's okay  It's good  It's great  One minute we're talking about Tom Papa  Then during a commercial break  Colin Quinn is calling Tom Papa  Guilting him into  Coming on the show  Tom Papa shows up  Trace Atkins walks in  Guy Fieri shows up  You know what my favorite part of the show  And it was an action packed show  Non-stop  Action packed  We said 
[04:03:30]  The Barry Williams call  Happened at quarter to seven  Yeah  Quarter to seven  You know what my favorite part of the show was?  No I do not  Anthony dissecting the Jason Ellis clip  That was very interesting to me  Yeah  Did you pick up on  Yeah I thought that  But you know  He had a better way of  Putting it into words  Yeah  What was going on  Cause it just  It is that like  Maybe I was being too humble  I've been told many times  That my humility is what holds me back  Well I think  I personally think  If it was anybody else  Saying that about you  You would have fired back  No  You would have  Gone after them 
[04:04:00]  I don't think you want to  You're looking to go down the road  With Jason Ellis  I just didn't  I guess when I heard it  I was like  Okay  At that moment  I said he's being respectful  Is he?  Was he?  But maybe not  Like once Ant  Starts breaking it down  And you start breaking it down  I'm like  Wait  He did say I was annoying  And by the way  Am I wrong to say that  Jason Ellis  Also sounds annoying?  Yeah  You know  Is that crazy  To be like  Well Jason Ellis  Is one that sounds  Quite annoying too  He's always shouting 
[04:04:30]  In an Australian accent  About fighting people  And skateboarding  How about  Sometimes people  Just want to chill out  For a second  And enjoy a show  Yeah  Not everybody's  Looking to fucking box  You know  Yeah  Not everybody's  Looking to grapple  Sometimes we just  Want to chill out  And hear a nice  American accent  Just talking some fun shit  Yeah  Like today  We had a great show  Over four hours  Four and a half hours  Of great radio  Not one person  Had to skateboard  To get here 
[04:05:00]  Okay  Not one person  Had to challenge anyone  To a fight  Not once  Did motocross come up  Right  And it was still  A great show  In fact  Today's show  Was one of the best shows  Of any show  On SiriusXM  Yeah  I challenge you  To find anyone  Doing  Who works for SiriusXM  Doing a better show  Than today's show  And give it a 24 hour period  Within 24 hours  Yeah  There will not be  A better show  On this platform  Than the one today here  And there was not  One mention of the X Games  The whole time  So it's like 
[04:05:30]  Okay  That really makes me rethink  And I like how I get  Anthony lumps me  Into the extreme  40 year olds  First of all  I'm not 40  First of all  First of all  Second of all  So I like the skateboard  Who cares  Lil Jon's skateboards  Who gives a shit  He does  So Lil Wayne  So Lil Wayne start  How you doing Nicole  I just have a question  That's completely unrelated  I don't mean to  Barge into your show  No you're always welcome  But if you  It's Nicole from the Morning Man  If you saw me  Walking down the hole crying  Would you say  What the fuck 
[04:06:00]  Is the matter with you  No I said  You okay  That's what my husband said  The fuck is the matter with you  She walked down  We don't have time  To get into it unfortunately  But I saw her  When I was going to bed  And Nicole was walking up the hall  And she's crying  She's in tears  I'm like  You okay  Yeah  Can I tell you  You said fuck Ryan  I think  Yeah cause we got in a fight  And that's where it started  Ryan doesn't even talk  How could you get in a fight  With Ryan  Well he lit into me  Let's just put it that way  Wow  Man I wish I had time for this  Yeah it's okay  I'm gonna go  I just wanted to know your opinion  Your husband said  What the fuck is wrong with you 
[04:06:30]  Yeah what the fuck is wrong with you  Lately  Cause I was crying  I was like  I just got in a fight with Ryan  And he was on his way to play golf  Have fun playing golf  And he goes  I have to work too  Go fuck yourself Matt  I heard you were having a rough one yesterday too  Maybe that's where the lately thing came in  Yeah  We had  There was a little  Yeah  And then Wednesday  You got into a fight with your boss  That was a rough one  Yeah  I've been fighting a lot  Yeah I totally have my period right now  You do  So that made me a little bit more hormonal  But it's just been in general  Period  That's the opposite of pregnant  Yeah  No 
[04:07:00]  Not pregnant guys  Whoever keeps pretending that I am  That's a sex bagel  Hey sex bagel  I'm not pregnant  But I must say Nicole  You look really good today  Oh you know what Troy  You always love my spirit  Thank you  The frazzled look works for you  Does it?  Yeah it does  She always looks good  Every day she comes in here  God damn is what I say  God damn  It ain't like Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction  Alright  But you don't do coke  We gotta get out of here  Ron and Fez are coming up next  So enjoy their show  And we'll be back with more of this next week
