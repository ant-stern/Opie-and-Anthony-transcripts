<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts expressing anger over their show's preemption in Boston, despite their attempts to secure airtime. They touted the previous day's broadcast as particularly compelling, mentioning candid confessions from Anthony and noteworthy interactions between Colin and Patrice.  The conversation then pivoted to the ongoing economic crisis and the proposed $700 billion bailout package. Opie and Anthony humorously speculated about potential societal fallout, envisioning soup lines and a return to Great Depression-era conditions.  They mocked the perceived artificiality of modern finance, contrasting it with the tangible reality of physical cash. Opie even confessed to his own financially reckless behavior, drawing parallels to the government's spending habits.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a segment on David Blaine's latest stunt – a purported 60-hour upside-down hang.  A reporter, Sam,  was dispatched to cover the event and reported back that Blaine was frequently taking breaks and using a cherry picker for support, contradicting the publicized duration of the stunt.  The hosts played audio clips from Sam’s interviews with Blaine and onlookers, highlighting the latter's surprisingly tolerant reaction to Blaine's apparent deception, which prompted much mockery from Opie and Anthony.  They also discussed what they perceived as veiled insults directed at Opie within a local news anchor's traffic reports.

The show concluded with a brief mention of an internet rumor, originating from segment contributor "Stunt Brain," which had gained traction in mainstream news outlets.  The hosts promised further updates on both the David Blaine hoax and a vaguely described, but seemingly significant, "hostage exchange" story.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's get the show on the road, huh?  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  I want to welcome Boston back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  They were doing a good thing up there in Boston, and they preempted us.  And that's too bad, because we had a great show yesterday,  which was very, very frustrating to us here in New York City.  Next time that happens, for the real hardcore fans, 
[00:00:30]  you can still listen to the show online.  Just find our flagship station here in New York City,  and you can at least take a listen that way.  Got a little lap.  On your iPhone, you could listen also.  Yeah.  Oh, sure.  Did they play it in the afternoon, though?  We tried to get the show played in the afternoon yesterday,  but no one returned my emails that I sent out.  I didn't think they would know it.  The new program director, who hasn't really talked to us yet, 
[00:01:00]  we sent emails to him and some of the corporate bigwigs,  and said, look, today's show is really, really good.  It really needs to be heard in Boston today.  Just throw it on at afternoons.  You know, think out of the box.  That's what I think radio needs to do these days.  Just think out of the box.  Just throw it on at afternoons for the day.  And no one wrote me back, so that's good.  Boston, you missed a tremendous amount of interesting stuff between Colin and Patrice, 
[00:01:30]  and you missed Anthony spilling his guts on stuff I didn't even know,  and I know Anthony really well.  It was very interesting.  Spilled his guts on a lot of things yesterday.  Yeah.  But it's very bothersome that no one even writes me back.  Like, we have this passion to do this radio show,  and we're trying to figure things out as we go,  and to not even get an email back, that's kind of silly.  It's a goddamn disgrace! 
[00:02:00]  That's kind of silly.  At least write an email back going, you know, this is what we're going to do,  or, wow, that's a good idea.  Let me look into it.  But I guess they know what they're doing, right?  Right, Ant?  I've never seen a radio exec that did, so is this something new?  Oh, they're all the same, man.  Yeah.  They're just waiting for some kind of bailout plan.  Something, yeah.  Holy mother of God.  So is the economy, like, collapsing? 
[00:02:30]  Who can we go to today?  Because I'm watching that President Bush last night, and I'm like,  so basically he's saying if this $700 billion thing doesn't go through,  the whole economy collapses, and then what does that mean?  It's bad.  Are we going to be on bread lines, soup lines?  Yeah, there's going to be soup lines.  People are going to have shanty towns in the Midwest.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to look just like the Great Depression.  Everything's going to turn black and white.  And we're all going to drive in old Model T's. 
[00:03:00]  It's just good to know that America has $700 billion to throw out a problem.  I don't think we do.  It's just we go into debt.  That's what we do, though.  But we've been in massive debt before.  Just relax.  It's not real money.  It's fake money.  It's like written on paper money.  Yeah, so we'll just print more.  We'll just make more.  You don't even have to print more.  You just write it down and say, yeah, okay, $700 billion.  And it's written down.  So it's like, see, that's what we need.  And then you never really see. 
[00:03:30]  There's not a guy sitting there going, one, two, three, four.  You made me lose count.  Let me start over.  Yeah.  It's not real money.  They're still counting.  The whole world's based on fake money, paper money, value of things that really have no value.  Fake value that people pump up with the market.  It's just this whole perception of value is more important than real value these days. 
[00:04:00]  So that's what happens.  So we're living a fake existence?  Yeah.  The only real money is what you have in your pocket.  Oh, boy.  That's about it.  I'm in trouble then.  Are you in trouble?  Yeah.  You know me.  I'm always borrowing money.  Oh, boy.  You're like the government.  Yeah, but I can't keep money in my wallet.  Whatever money I have in my wallet, I spend.  Like, I know, you know, you have no problem, like, having a few bucks in your wallet.  Yeah, you're like the United States.  I'm like Dubai. 
[00:04:30]  I just, if I have it, I spend it.  Then next thing you know, I don't have any money on it.  You're what my mother used to call being N rich.  Yeah.  Only she didn't say N, you know.  God.  Yeah, I know.  If I, if I, if I, if I'm ever held up, they're going to be very disappointed.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Don't you have a radio show?  Don't you do?  What?  Yeah, I just.  I'm going to, I'm going to be pistol, pistol whipped extra hard because they're going to 
[00:05:00]  be like, you've got to be kidding me.  Be like, no one carries $3 with them in New York City.  They'll be like, I knew we picked the wrong guy.  I'm the worst.  It's the other one is supposed to be the guy.  I really am the worst.  But he's the gun nut.  Yeah.  It's a fine line they got to tread with us.  I think what happened was when I was growing up, it was so rare for any of us to have money  that when we did, oh my God, we have money and you'd go spend it on something.  Yeah.  And I, and that philosophy continues to this day. 
[00:05:30]  So like if you gave me $500 for whatever reason, they would be gone by noon.  I would just start buying stuff that I don't need.  Funny you chose that figure.  500?  Yeah.  500.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to get, we're going to get the Anthony hostage exchange update a little later.  Yeah.  We'll give you the exchange.  I'll give you this little tidbit though.  It did go down.  It did go down, but we have new information.  A little new information.  I want, I want more people to wake up so they hear this one. 
[00:06:00]  And this is what Boston missed yesterday.  Some really, really good stuff.  What are you laughing at?  And I think there's little quips going out at me.  You know how people say the TV's talking to them and they put on tinfoil hats?  Yeah.  I'm ready for the tinfoil hat because I really think there's some jabs being taken at me  during traffic reports.  Today?  Yeah.  Oh, is she?  I'm not sure.  Oh, is she insane.  So if somebody might monitor that and maybe catch any, any of these little, they're very,  very inside.  So I'm not even sure if people would get them.  Mm-hmm.  But, um, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  What was one you heard?  I think I heard something like, yeah, I got to get that old thing out of there or something.  Like, I don't know.  There's like things going on.  I think there's a little, then you hear like, you hear like cameramen laughing and stuff.  So I think there's something going on.  Is there a little paranoia in your head now?  No, no, it's not paranoia.  I, I've, I would find it hysterically funny.  I hope that was happening.  I hope she just stops the traffic and goes, look, this is my side.  Yeah.  Here's what happened.  I don't have a radio show. 
[00:07:00]  So bear with me, uh, Craig and whatever that bimbo's name is.  It is really odd to choose, um, to really, uh, uh, kind of rag on or, or put me in a position  where it's a breakup, but a bunch of weird stuff happened, you know, with, with all the  little hostage exchange stuff and things being burned and all that.  Knowing that I do have a radio show.  Yeah.  I'm not just like some businessman or something that could tell his buddies.  Yeah.  Like I have a radio show in New York too. 
[00:07:30]  So I could just say whatever I goddamn well please.  And it's going to go out there.  What are you crazy?  And that's, and that's, what's great about doing a radio show.  I feel like I would have had a nervous breakdown years ago if I didn't have a radio show.  Yeah.  Because like when, when this crap happens to, to, to, to you happens to all of us, the people  listening to the radio, there's a frustration that hits you.  Oh yeah.  And we, we have the pleasure of being able to vent that to a lot of people that, that 
[00:08:00]  makes, makes it feel like you're doing something about it.  You know what I mean?  Like if a customer service person is, is nasty to you or some dude at the car dealership or  at, or at Starbucks, you know, you, you, you feel helpless.  But if you have a radio show, you feel like you can punch back.  It's very cathartic for us.  And I think people live vicariously through us in that way.  Just to know sometimes you can't change things, man, but like if someone douches you hard  enough, because the fans get deal with it too.  Yeah.  And they try to rally around and they just like, yeah, let's stick it to somebody who 
[00:08:30]  we're always dealing with.  Yeah.  And, uh, it's just nice to know you ruin someone's day once in a while.  Oh yeah.  What were you doing?  Pacino impressions all night?  Yeah.  My voice is messed up.  Yeah.  What's up with your voice lately?  People are noticing that your voice is shot lately.  I don't know.  I have, um, uh, throat polyps.  Oh no.  There's nothing serious.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy's got cancer?  No.  Oh my God.  What is that?  They're photographing.  I saw pictures of them.  You'll still be funny, Jimmy. 
[00:09:00]  I hope so.  Thank God for the writing.  Did I ever tell you about Monster Rain?  But no, I have to go back.  Um, I don't know what it is.  Could it be because I'm sleeping with the air conditioning?  It's been a little scratchy lately.  Oh boy.  Oh yeah.  No, it's nothing.  Drink some tea with honey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, we got lots to do.  Should we, we, we, protein injection?  I want to, I want to, no, no, no, that's why I can't sit.  I have one suggestion.  Yeah.  As to what we could do about these Wall Street crisis. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  In India.  Yeah.  They, they, they, they beat a CEO to death.  Oh.  And I'm just telling you that if that happened more, if guys who ruined people's lives were  dragged out of their offices and beaten to death in the middle of the street, it would  not happen as much.  I think we do need to head toward a little bit more, um, violence as consequences.  There's no consequences.  No.  The consequences are they lose their jobs, but they have what they call the golden parachute  and they get to sit out with multi-million dollar, um, packages, uh, that they get to 
[00:10:00]  leave these companies with.  Yeah.  What's, what kind of consequence is that?  I say we, uh, do some stoning.  Oh, the old fashioned stoning.  Yeah.  Let's start with some stoning.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, bring in, uh, Sam.  Sam, we got to get this David Blaine off our plate.  Sam.  Yesterday's show was, uh, so action-packed, we never got to the David Blaine stuff, and  Sam went down there and interviewed this fraud, and, uh, we never, we weren't able to, uh, 
[00:10:30]  play the audio yesterday, unfortunately, because, you know, we had so many people stopping by.  And now everyone's on to it.  Like, Sam had it yesterday.  He had it yesterday, and we couldn't get to the audio.  But now everyone's on to it.  Yeah.  And they're just calling this guy a douche.  Josh, speaking, uh, of being on to something, don't go anywhere, because Stunt Brain has  started something that is, that is, that is starting to take over.  He started a rumor.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He started a rumor that has now hit Fox News and, and, and, uh, and a lot of, uh, the political 
[00:11:00]  blogs, right?  The Clay Aiken gay thing?  No.  Not a rumor.  Uh, stick around for that.  Steve Carlisi straight thing?  Not a rumor.  Yes, I get it, I'm gay.  Stunt Brain started it, though, and it's, it's quite impressive.  And it's got legs, my friend.  We'll explain in about, uh, I don't know, a few more minutes here.  Yeah.  Uh, so we got Sam in studio.  What's the haps at the David Blaine, uh, stunt thing, right?  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  What's the craps?  What's the craps?  Yeah, right.  Let me tell you, because there's nothing going on down there that, uh, that's magic.  No.  There is no magic there.  Just lies.  And it's finally over?  Yeah.  Just lies.  Lies.  Yeah, it was a, just a huge ending last night's special.  Yeah.  It was, uh, he climbed up to the top of where he was hanging from, and then they were like,  this is the dive of death.  He's gonna jump 44 feet onto a platform.  Wow.  Who calls it the dive of death?  He did.  He was selling posters that said dive of death.  Dive of death. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  So he jumps off, except there's a cable attached to him, and everybody's like, hey, what's going  on?  And so just before he hits the ground, the cable stops him and starts pulling him back  up, and then he pulls him way back up into the sky, but it's nighttime, and everybody's  like, what happened?  And then the announcer goes, unbelievable, he has disappeared into thin air.  So the lighting didn't go up high enough, so he was still above the lights, but he can't  see because it wasn't lit up.  And everyone knew it was a cable that was pulling him up. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, it was a very visible cable.  Yeah, it didn't look like he was levitating himself.  No, it was a steel, you know, working cable.  I think when this guy walks around, he's embarrassed to be David Blaine.  He should be.  I mean, he should stick to card tricks.  Sure.  Absolutely.  But Sam went down there to witness David Blaine taking, what, 10 minute breaks every hour?  Yeah, like, I was there for like an hour and a half, and he was right side up twice  for like 10 minutes while I was there.  They have a cherry picker right by where he's hanging from. 
[00:13:00]  Wait, he was supposed to hang for 60 straight hours?  No, about 45 minutes.  What?  That's how long.  So he was supposed to, yeah.  He was only hanging for 45 minutes an hour and then taking 10, 15 minute breaks?  Yes.  Every hour?  Yeah.  It was promoted as David Blaine hangs upside down for 60 hours.  Right.  And he's going to put in a catheter.  He's always got a catheter, his magical catheter.  Well, he loves that catheter.  Yeah.  What's that about?  And he was supposed to like, just hang there.  And then it turns out, he's taking breaks every 45 minutes to stand up and let the blood 
[00:13:30]  recirculate.  And they were saying it was like to empty the catheter and stuff.  But I was like, if you're going to stand up to empty the trip, why don't you just use  a jar?  Yeah.  Why use a catheter?  He said, I'm not going to whiz all over myself for these people.  That's what he said.  Why?  So he stands up and goes.  Why are we the only ones calling him out on this?  I don't know.  And there's no way.  Oh, the media's starting to do it.  There's no way he has to go that often. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like every 45 minutes, because they have a cherry picker, like right by where he's hanging  from.  Yeah.  How old is he going to go?  They raise him 40 feet in the air and then bring him towards the cherry picker and flip  him right side up.  And he stood on it.  Mm-hmm.  That is not a stunt.  No.  That is as lame as they get.  If we did that for our radio show, our fans would pelt us with stuff.  Of course.  Of course.  They would do that anyway.  They would just start yelling, hacks, hacks, hacks.  But like, baba booey, baba booey, baba booey, hacks, hacks. 
[00:14:30]  But like the people who show up, they don't want to believe that their hero is a fraud.  Yeah.  So they're like, oh yeah, for a medical thing.  Right.  And then like as if, yeah, this was part of the plan the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course it was.  No.  He said he was going to hang there for 60 hours.  And when you mean fans, you mean fat broads that think David Blaine is going to have  sex with them.  Yeah.  Yeah, they got a shot.  They got, his fans are a bunch of broads that think they're going to sleep with this  guy.  Ugh.  Here's what's the haps from the David Blaine stunt. 
[00:15:00]  We meet Lizzie.  All right.  So we're here with Lizzie at the David Blaine thing.  Lizzie, what's the haps?  What's the haps?  Um, I think that he must be, uh, very strong.  Um, and, uh, I wouldn't like to do that.  I think his head must have a really bad headache by now.  Where are you from?  From, uh, the UK, from the north of England.  When he was in the UK hanging, uh, from the bridge in that box, weren't a bunch of you,  like, throwing eggs and stuff at him?  Yeah, they weren't being very, very kind to him there, were they? 
[00:15:30]  Don't you think they should kind of be throwing eggs at him today, too?  No, no, no.  He deserves, uh, to be looked after well today.  Why?  Why?  Because he looks very hard.  But he did it himself.  It's not like he's forced.  I know.  Well, he's crazy.  Yeah.  Did she say he looks very hard?  I don't know.  Is that what you said?  This was one of those, uh, fat broads that you were talking about.  Of course.  Fat broads and gay guys, right?  Yeah, well, this other guy's not a gay guy. 
[00:16:00]  This is a black guy who was probably high.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, and homeless guys, because, you know, probably high.  Because the police aren't going to chase him away.  Right.  Hey, I'm here watching David Blaine.  You can't, look, public property.  I'm just sitting here watching him.  All right, so we're here at the David Blaine thing with Jeffrey.  Jeffrey, what's the haps?  What's the haps?  He actually ran away.  Yeah, he started running.  He ran away.  Oh, like, he started, he laughed, and then he started running away. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, he probably thought you were a cop.  For what's the haps?  Yeah.  It's like a code word for, come on in now.  Yeah.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  All cars, come in.  Move in now.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  It's like the code word.  Like, what's the haps?  Like, what's happening?  Yeah.  You mean the David Blaine?  Yeah.  Oh, man, the guy is crazy, man.  Yeah.  But he's cool.  Have you seen him go up on his feet? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I've seen him go up on his feet.  Do you think that takes away from the whole thing that he's doing, his whole stunt?  A little, but I think it's safer, you know?  You've got to protect yourself still.  But that's just, okay, hold on.  You're not supposed to protect yourself when you're David Blaine.  You're supposed to do things that are amazing and superhuman.  Right.  That's like his gimmick.  Right.  That he's able to do these things that the normal person can't do.  Right.  So it's not a thing of safety.  Well, it's got to be safe. 
[00:17:30]  No.  He's supposed to be doing things like stupid Criss Angel.  He blows himself up.  He drops himself off of buildings, whatever the hell else he does.  And he's keeping himself safe.  But the difference between Criss Angel and this David Blaine, Criss Angel keeps himself  safe behind the scenes where no one could see him being safe.  Trying to be behind a wall on these things.  One of the shenanigans are going on.  Like David Blaine, he's getting lazy.  It's like, okay, I'm going to hang upside down for 45 hours.  I know if I do that for real, I'm going to die. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  So I need to do standing breaks.  So somehow I've got to figure out how I can stand without the public knowing I'm going  to do the standing thing.  He's doing tricks now without the sheet.  Right.  This is why the magicians have the sheet.  And you're always like, why don't they do it without the sheet one time?  Well, this is it without the sheet.  And it sucks.  If they did it without the sheet, then you would realize, wow, this is right.  This is something anyone could do.  This is terrible.  Right.  He said ABC put all this money into it because they had this big special.  Right.  So they're still going like, yeah, he's been hanging upside down for 60 hours. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Because ABC bought.  They're lying.  It is.  It's lies.  Well, they got stuck because I think they bought like three or four specials ahead of time  from David Blaine.  So now they're like, oh, my God.  What are they?  What?  So he's just trying to fulfill an obligation like when bad albums come out from artists.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I signed with this record company.  I'm obligated for two more albums.  All right.  Let's do Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.  All right.  My next start, I'm going to sleep 10 hours a day for a week straight.  I'm going to be taking my 12 to 14 hour walking around the world breaks. 
[00:19:00]  The final special is just footage of him at ABC negotiating the contract.  Yeah.  Watch what I got these idiots to agree to.  Yeah.  So he couldn't figure out how he was going to be able to stand to relieve himself of the  blood rushing to his head.  So he just stood.  So he just stood and came up with some weird, well, medically, they want to check me out.  Yeah.  They were like, yeah, there's a medical check at 1230 and then at 115 and then at 2.  Sam got the exclusive interview with the hack himself. 
[00:19:30]  David Blaine.  You interviewed him as he's hanging upside down.  You guys look like you're getting ready for one of those Spider-Man kisses.  Oh.  He's upside down in front of Sam.  That's funny.  The Spider-Man kiss.  As you're interviewing him.  It looked like he's moved in for a little smoochy smooch.  He did make him go face to face.  Yeah.  Wow.  Here we go.  Sam meets David Blaine.  All right.  So we're here in Central Park with David Blaine.  David Blaine, what's the haps?  I don't know. 
[00:20:00]  What's the haps with you?  Not too much.  We're just here checking you out.  So how often are you going up and standing right side up during the day?  Every time I have to go to the bathroom or get sunscreen or chapstick, I go up and reverse.  Contemplate my career.  Probably once every hour for about five to ten minutes.  He admitted that he's standing so he can put on chapstick.  Nobody asked him.  Houdini never put on chapstick.  Chapstick. 
[00:20:30]  Houdini.  Houdini never had sunscreen.  Why can't you do that upside down?  It doesn't leak off you.  Right.  Why aren't people yelling and screaming about this idiot?  He actually admitted that he takes breaks to put sunscreen on.  It's almost October.  I've been sitting there under him for the past.  Oh, you were.  Well, he was up in the sky.  Oh, up in the sky.  For the past two times.  Very close to a 69 position.  Okay, no.  He was up.  No. 
[00:21:00]  The pictures are on onaradio.com, by the way.  Yes.  But yeah, I just don't think.  I think he realized he couldn't lie about it because he was just standing up five minutes  before I talked to him.  Right.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Oh, so you kind of caught him?  Yeah, and so instead he said I just had to go up and put some chapstick on.  I got to, you know, every 45 minutes I stand up to comb my hair.  I, you know, I want to keep my breath fresh, so I brush my teeth.  I do everything.  You can't brush your teeth and put mouthwash in your mouth if you're upside down, so I 
[00:21:30]  do that.  A lot of things you can't do upside down.  Right.  Unbelievable.  It's imperative.  So what's going to happen after you're done hanging here?  Is there some kind of big, like, trick?  Yeah, there's a little surprise I got planned.  I don't know how it's going to work because it's never been done before and I haven't tested  it.  Because it's lame.  Well, basically what he's saying there is I haven't gotten to that part yet in planning  this thing.  Still thinking it over.  Figuring out how I'm going to get out of this mess.  I'm doing the dive of death or the cable pulls me up into the dark sky trick. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, there's no dive of death.  No.  At all.  In the dive of death poster, is there a picture of the cable?  No, the dive of death poster is like a Houdini-esque drawing of David Blaine, you know,  flying down from the sky head first to certain death.  Yeah.  But where's the cable in the...  No, cable wasn't included.  Career falling to its certain death.  So you're trying to say that David Blaine is just a regular Joe.  He's just a guy.  Like you and I, Sam.  He's got no powers. 
[00:22:30]  God.  Tested it.  But it is a pretty extreme and crazy ending, yeah.  Can you give us any hints as to what it is?  Are you going to disappear or something?  Uh, it wouldn't be that simple, right?  Why are you doing this?  Oh, this is what I like to do.  Hang upside down?  I like creating interesting ideas and images and challenges for myself.  Interesting parts that's missing.  And then doing that and not letting anybody kind of interfere, which people do try to interfere, always.  I cursed Sam today because you gave David Blaine the idea to just disappear into the night sky. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, he's like, hey, that's kind of...  Wow.  He probably said, you know what, that's exactly what I'm going to end up doing.  This little fuzzy-headed kid is on to something.  I was trying to ask smart-ass questions, and I was like, what's the stupidest thing a magician could do?  Just disappear after this.  And that's exactly what he did last night.  Yes, that's what he did.  How do you feel about the people who say that this is not a magic trick?  Oh, I don't care.  I like people who can say whatever they want. 
[00:23:30]  Do you consider it a magic trick?  Uh, not really.  What would you classify it as?  I mean, I like to use the word endurance, because I like testing what we can endure, because it's amazing how much we actually can endure.  Yeah, when you take breaks, everybody, you know, it's like somebody loses a parent, all of a sudden, a situation they thought they could never deal with, all of a sudden, they find the good in it.  Yeah, losing a parent is just like hanging upside down, you dope.  Do a headstand for 45 minutes. 
[00:24:00]  If you're a bat, maybe, and your parents fell off the leg.  Yeah, we got it, Jim.  They find the beauty out of it.  So I think it's possible for people to pick anything in their head and just try to do it, no matter how bizarre or how strange it is.  Do you think it's strange that this many people would come to see you hang upside down?  Do I think it's strange that you came to talk to me?  No.  Oh, well, we came there to mock you, you dope.  Jennifer in New York still wants to believe in something. 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  Go ahead, Jennifer.  Oh, no, I didn't say I wanted to believe in him at all.  I said that I heard an interview that said that originally he was going to do this completely upside down.  He said that he was going to do sit-ups while he was hanging upside down to keep the circulation going, and he was going to pee out of a catheter.  He said the first hour into it he realized that he couldn't pee upside down and that it was going to be a problem for him to do the sit-ups and just maintain his blood flow that way. 
[00:25:00]  So his doctors told him that it would be best for him to come down, but he said that he fully intended to do it upside down the entire time.  Yeah, of course he did.  Yeah, of course he's going to say he fully intended, and then a doctor stopped him.  Shut up!  Even if you can pee upside down!  But even if he did fully intend to do it, that means he couldn't do the trick.  The whole point of the magic trick is either you can't...  You're like, oh, well, I couldn't do it.  I meant to disappear, but I'm still here.  Yeah, I could do that.  I could go up on stage, Anthony, the greatest magician ever, and then just go, I can't do this one. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I fully intended to disappear, but I'm just going to run off stage.  Yeah, I really meant to do it.  Correct me if I'm wrong, though, but doesn't a catheter just make you pee?  I mean, you have no control over that.  Yeah, it just kind of leaks out from your bladder.  Exactly.  So he wouldn't have even had to be concerned about pee.  It would have just happened.  Right.  The point we're making, the guy's a hack, and it's time to shut him down.  Enough of these silly stunts around New York City.  Go back to the street magic stuff.  That's pretty good. 
[00:26:00]  Cute card tricks.  That's more your style.  And no chapstick.  Leave this stuff to the past greats like Houdini.  You're nowhere near a Houdini.  Thank you, Jennifer.  Have a good day.  Bye.  All right.  And then finally, why do they call you the mind freak?  No, that's another guy.  Oh, you rock.  Oh, damn.  Oh, did you.  Oh, that was despicable.  Sam's showing he's got some balls.  The mind freak.  As soon as I asked him that question, I started getting taps on my arm from his people going, 
[00:26:30]  okay, all right, we're good.  All right, we're done.  This guy's trouble.  And finally, why do they call you the mind freak?  No, that's another guy, I think.  I think you're confusing me with David Copperfield.  Oh, would you consider this a mind freak?  I don't think so.  Okay, cool.  Well, thanks a lot.  By the way, I love your hair.  Thank you very much.  I really do.  Thank you.  It's good.  It's magical.  Oh, yeah.  David Blaine.  Uh-huh.  Did he exchange numbers? 
[00:27:00]  No, he was upside down.  He loved your hair.  Oh, really?  What else did he love about you?  I have to wait another 45 minutes because he was flipping upside down if he wanted to  make a phone call and stuff.  Now, when he said, you confused me with David Copperfield, why didn't you say no?  If I was, I would have thought you raped somebody on the island.  Yeah, that's right.  As opposed to the public who you're raping right now.  Rape island.  Rape island.  All right.  Well.  What's the haps?  We're really late, but we have the grand finale of this stunt that ABC aired last night, I guess. 
[00:27:30]  I didn't see it.  And we got like the three quick highlights that are just a joke.  You want to do it after the break?  I say they wait through the break.  All right.  Also, Anthony's got an update.  Yes, an update on the hostage exchange.  Which you have no problem saying went down, but the details are quite interesting.  There's a few other, you know, just a couple of other things that happened that were a little surprising. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  And also, you think there might be secret messages with Jill on Channel 11 this morning here in New York City?  Yeah, I was just hearing some things as I was in the office.  Little jabs at you?  Yeah, I was listening really closely, but I just heard like a few key words and then camera people laughing and stuff.  So I don't know if, you know, things are being said.  Did you say a cuckold is broken down in the left lane?  Been rear-ended by a long black car?  A cuckold.  Service the bull. 
[00:28:30]  I heard it on the replay the other day.  That is terrible.  So wrong.  Servicing the bull.  Servicing the bull.  Of course, servicing the bull.  Is wrong.  And also, Stump Brain started a...  It's a horrible term.  Started an internet rumor that is pretty much spreading all over the place.  We'll get into that as well next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
