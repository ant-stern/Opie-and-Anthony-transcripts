<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie ill (possibly dengue fever or laryngitis), leaving Anthony to host solo with Danny Ross and Sam Roberts on soundboard.  Scheduled guests included Patrice O'Neal and Joe DeRosa. Anthony vowed to minimize caller participation.  He then launched into humorous and often confrontational anecdotes about his role as a stepfather, highlighting the challenges of balancing relationships and parental responsibilities.

The show took a significant turn into explicit discussions about pornography, detailing the hosts' and guests' viewing habits, preferences for specific websites, genres (including Japanese porn and "horny grannies"), and the evolution of the industry from VHS to online content.  Specific performers like Brittany and Whitney Stevens, Brie Olsen, and Nina Hartley were mentioned, along with the shift from star-driven porn to content-focused production.  They also debated the accessibility of pornography for younger generations and its effects on their sexual experiences.

A large portion focused on pornographic parodies of sitcoms, particularly "This Ain't the Cosby Show" and "This Ain't Married... with Children," with graphic descriptions of the films and discussions about the lack of legal repercussions for copyright infringement.  Comedian Thomas Ward, who played Bill Cosby in the parody, was discussed.

The conversation then shifted to a heated debate about the HTC Evo smartphone, with Joe DeRosa enthusiastically advocating for it, while the hosts and other guests, including Patrice O'Neal and a phone call from Bobby Kelly, mocked and ridiculed his enthusiasm.  This led to a playful but contentious comparison of the Evo to the iPhone and BlackBerry, covering features, service providers (Sprint, AT&T, Verizon), and user experience.  The discussion with Bobby Kelly devolved into a comedic argument about whether Kelly had previously endorsed the Evo as "hands down the best."

A later segment included a phone call from Joe DeRosa imitating Bobby Kelly, followed by a debate on regional food preferences (Philly cheesesteaks, Chicago deep-dish pizza, New York pizza, Texas barbecue), with Patrice O’Neal vehemently insulting Chicago deep-dish pizza. A listener call further fueled this argument.  The insults continued, targeting Chicago-style hot dogs among other things.  Bobby Kelly called in again, joining the banter. The conversation circled back to Joe DeRosa’s phone, evolving into a broader argument about technology.  This segued into a lengthy, crude interview with Dustin, a 32-year-old intern,  filled with jokes at his expense about his appearance, life, and lack of romantic success, culminating in a bet about when he last had sex.

UFC fighter Forrest Griffin then joined the show to promote his apocalyptic survival guide. He detailed his extensive firearms collection (including ARs, an SL8, and a Barrett .50 cal), discussing ammunition costs and safety concerns.  The book's content, including sections on creating a "pocket pussy" and preparing human meat, was discussed.  Griffin shared anecdotes about his MMA career, including his friendship with the deceased Big John (to whom the book is dedicated).  The hosts and Griffin discussed societal collapse scenarios, survival strategies, and their opinions on action movies.  The hosts later criticized themselves for not taking listener calls during Griffin’s segment.  The show briefly played a clip of Lady Gaga's Arizona concert where she addressed immigration law and death threats against the sheriff.

The show concluded with a scathing and comedic critique of a Lady Gaga song, using profanity-laced jokes and sarcastic commentary to mock the perceived hypocrisy between her opulent lifestyle and her political activism regarding immigration and AIDS in Africa. The hosts repeatedly played clips of the song, interjecting with phrases like "horse shit" and frequent use of "fuck."  They referenced Gaga’s call for a boycott of Arizona due to SB 1070.  The final moments included plugs for their own appearances and merchandise, along with shout-outs to Patrice O'Neal and Joe DeRosa.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This show is like the box of chocolate. 
[00:00:30]  That's that far as Smother was talking about.  You're a no good son of a bitch.  Bob, you mother.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on.  It's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Woo!  Woo!  T-t-t-t. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Brogram.  How's everybody doing today?  Good?  I hope.  I certainly do hope so.  I care about each and every one of you out there.  Yuck.  Uh, yeah, well, uh, top story.  Opie, I was sick.  He's got no voice.  He's got like, uh, dengue fever, I think.  Really?  He's sweeping the nation in Florida. 
[00:01:30]  His blueberry muffins and fucking...  His thousand percent brand don't help him be healthy like everybody else?  You mean to tell me people eat pork chops in the morning?  Yeah.  Get the same diseases as people who just fucking eat?  What?  The tops of strawberries?  Not even...  It's the healthiest part.  The strawberry leaf?  It's the healthiest part of the strawberry.  Really?  Yeah.  So he's a little ill, ill-fated, getting old-manned laryngitis. 
[00:02:00]  I thought we cured that shit.  This nigga's got to get his tonsils taken out.  I don't know.  So he's getting...  He's 72.  He's having teenage fucking operations.  My glands are mono.  This nigga had mononucleosis at 50.  Enjoy your blueberries at home.  I'm sure he is.  Yeah, it's one of those deals. 
[00:02:30]  And Jimmy is perusing, carousing the nation, doing his Jimmy Norton comedy thing.  So today, Patrice O'Neill, the always entertaining Patrice O'Neill, and Joe DeRosa.  Thank you.  Are going to be joining me and, of course, the lovely and talented Danny Ross and primetime  primetime Sam Roberts running the board for just a day of fun, hijinks, shenanigans, and 
[00:03:00]  conversation.  And since I'm the only one here...  How much time we got left?  I know.  I'm like, fuck it.  Shit.  I'm looking at the clock already.  Ready to go.  It's like, don't bother calling.  I don't take phone calls.  Oh, it's going to be really bad.  Because, you know...  I just hate that.  Fucking O'Neill looks at that board, and it's just going to be like fucking Jonathan from  Vermont, whoever's fucking listening to this show.  I hate the callers. 
[00:03:30]  They contribute nothing to this show.  Hey, we got fucking Jonathan from Vermont.  I'm like, hey, boy, it's like a long girl and shut up.  And then there's their fucking...  There's the subject typed out of what they want to talk about, and they don't talk about  it.  I want to talk about bias ply tires.  But you said something about your mother fucked you when you were five.  No, that wasn't me.  All right, goodbye.  Gives a shit. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, how hurt they're going to be with verbose radio this morning.  They're sitting there.  Someone's fucking dialing the phone.  I can contribute.  Radio...  No, you can't.  Radio, no help.  Let me be honest with you callers.  You never fucking help.  He's home right now going, oh, no.  I gotta get in.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, give me that.  Just get me there.  Give me that medicine I didn't want to take. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know what happened.  He just got ridiculous sick.  I think rumor has it, not even tomorrow.  Oh, that kind of sick?  He's got the kind of sick when you know you can't even make it in the next day.  He has fucking can't make it tomorrow already sick?  He couldn't make it yesterday or tomorrow sick.  That's like crazy.  Holy fuck.  And then you got a baby.  So it's like, you got to wonder, what are you, quarantine yourself from a kid?  He's about to sleep in the closet or something.  Yeah, he's got to be sequestered.  He's like Bubble Boy from Seinfeld. 
[00:05:00]  You know the woman ain't letting him buy the baby.  You know she's not letting him buy the kid.  No, that's that motherly defense mechanism goes up.  And if you go, get away from the baby.  Don't come near the baby.  Isn't that nice when your wife casts you aside for something she's done for three months?  Just like, yeah, you've been hanging out together for years and then something brand new comes in and you are so sick and fiddle.  Yeah.  That's why I could never do that.  I mean, hey, God bless.  God bless anybody. 
[00:05:30]  You should have one of his oatmeal and fucking tree bark sandwiches.  I don't fucking heal him up.  Mr. Healthy.  This nigga got some kind of fucking virus running through his throat.  You know, when you're with a girl, and this is any couple that gets married and has kids.  It's like, I can't understand not being the guy.  And then a baby comes around and you're just like, you are now the fucking provider, but you're not first in line anymore. 
[00:06:00]  That fucking, the baby is first in line.  Nah, dude.  That's for, yeah.  That's for, I never, I don't think I'm ever going to have a kid.  I'm too selfish.  I hate the kid.  I'd be like, fuck you, you little prick.  I used to be.  I was fucking number one.  Steadfast against being with a woman with a kid.  Like, it was just, like my girl now got a kid.  It was, and I told her day one, you know, it's like, it's impossible for us to go further because you got a kid.  Oh, wow.  Really?  I like my own furniture in my house, you know? 
[00:06:30]  So, after years of like being around now, it's like she's my stepkid, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  But I still enjoy sometimes daddy.  Like, I'm not against, like adoptions, but adoptions or somebody else's kid or a woman with a kid, that doesn't bother me as much because you don't have to deal.  Like, when she's making me sick, the kid makes me sick.  It makes you sick.  If she makes me sick to the point where I don't love her. 
[00:07:00]  Like, I love the kid, but it's like sometimes they make you sick to like, you go, I don't love this kid.  This kid sucks.  And then that four days that you don't have to love him, I'm on the, where I'm on the road and really my girl has to figure out other things other than your kid isn't, you know, I don't have to care.  Like.  It's not your problem.  When I don't have to care, I don't have to care.  And when I do play daddy and it's like, cause before I was just like super, uh, uh, like the right guy. 
[00:07:30]  Like it was always, it was never discipline.  It was never talk.  It was always, oh, he's hilarious guy.  Yeah.  And, and it's a good thing.  But then I became, yeah, but then it became like, okay, could you take your, what was like the first thing you did that you said to go?  Hey, take your shoes off.  They're all dirty.  Uh, plate from the table, a plate from the table.  Here's where it changed.  Yeah.  I don't know where.  Hey, take this plate.  Uh, take your plate.  When you go, uh, you know, fuck you. 
[00:08:00]  You ain't my father.  Nope.  She didn't do that.  She never did that.  She goes, she looks at, she looks at her mother.  Oh, like who's this nigga?  So I looked at her do that and I go, oh, I can't, I gotta do this.  I, I, I had, I got her attention and I was like, I'm your mother's boss.  Oh, oh shit.  I'll throw your fucking mother out of here and you gotta go with her.  You said that to the kid?  Absolutely.  Guess what? 
[00:08:30]  She fucking takes the fucking plate now.  Faggot.  How old?  I'm so tired.  How old was she at the time?  She might've been seven.  So she was only, she was only mostly scarable at that point.  But that's what I'm saying.  It's like, you see these, it's practice dad.  Like, so I can definitely say whether or not this shit works.  Right.  It's a, it's very difficult.  You can experiment because it's not your kid.  But I said, I'm your mother.  Like, so what it is, is like she, I had to establish that she has to listen to me somehow. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Cause along with establishing that she, if she doesn't listen, I also had to establish that  she'll, I'll never dis, she'll never dislike me more than I could dislike her.  Meaning if she, if she ever was like, well, fuck you, buddy, I could, I'll go, well, Hey,  you know, I don't like talking to you anyway.  Like I would have to always be over, over that.  And, uh, you know, now she says, I love you a lot. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, but I don't, I go, I go, thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Because he's fucking, she's, he pulls a hot solo.  I know.  I know.  Oh, exactly.  I'm trying to help her fucking not, are you?  Not being trying to help her.  And Lawrence Fishburne, and a porno called Patrice's stepdaughter, sucks balls, fucking  volume two.  Lawrence Fishburne's face on a fucking porno body. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  I knew Patrice O'Neal, and this is what happened to me.  No guidance.  None.  But you, but, but now the other thing with, with your girl, though, you're the type of  personality that you're still number one with your girl, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  See, I'm talking guys that just relinquish number one status.  Well, because the kid is 11, though.  When the kid gets 11, you, you be, you revert back to.  I've seen a lot of fucking guys and girls that it never fucking comes back. 
[00:10:30]  The children are paramount.  The guy is second fiddle.  He is, his job is to go to work, bring home money so mom can buy food and do this and  be mom.  But you've seen those, those square, I think it really is a square group that does that  where, where I get something in my gut really bad when I see a man going through this, that  square thing.  Like one thing I had to point out to my girls that we don't have square people arguments. 
[00:11:00]  That's why I really never want to get married because I can, you can maintain your cool when  you're married.  Like you can maintain like your money.  If I'm having money problems, it's mine.  And so, but if I still do some stupid shit with my money, it's still my money that I'm  doing stupid shit with.  It's not like, Oh my God, you, we're the cable is due and you brought yourself $500 pair  of shoes.  Like it's none of those arguments, man.  It's none of those.  Your child has to eat and she's getting, uh, her real father's, she's getting money out 
[00:11:30]  of him every goddamn month, man.  It's not big money, but it's like to be forced.  He must hate that.  Like if you're, if you're in good standards with the bitch, right?  You just have to buy when you buy.  Right.  Like for my, for my dogs, it's like, Oh, we got a wee wee pads, nigga.  Get the wee wee pad, but I don't have to supply.  We, I can put a newspaper down if I need to, but if you have to fucking do that shit, that 
[00:12:00]  makes you resent something kind of, I don't have to feed her.  He must hate that Patrice O'Neill is, is with his ex, had a kid with, and he's got a  fork over money.  Well, I should hate it.  Of course.  Why should you hate it?  I feed somebody else's fucking scrotum.  She looks just like the motherfucker.  Lawrence Fishburne.  She looks like a father. 
[00:12:30]  Really?  Like it's a little piece of him rocking around talking to me.  It's not my kid.  That's gotta be annoying too then.  It's a big fucking deal that I'm decent to his kid.  Yeah.  I'm very good to her.  So it's like, you know, that's what you do.  What about the money he forks over?  Isn't that supposed to go to her?  Oh, it goes to her.  That's the pain to suffer, but that's not enough.  Oh, really?  That's just living.  When I was a kid, my mother used to have a job and steal from welfare.  And I wasn't living like a welfare thief. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  We stopped.  I got busted.  You know, they call her.  I feel bad to this day too because I was so not street smart.  They fucking actually caught her.  Oh, they caught her.  Yeah, man, we speak to your mother.  I go, she's not here.  Oh, is she at work?  Yes.  Well, thank you.  Tell her this was public welfare.  Cut that welfare off.  But it wasn't like it's supplement.  So whatever dough he's shoveling out every month, I don't even know what it is. 
[00:13:30]  I don't even ask.  But it's not a foot in the entire bill.  So then you come in.  I come in to give her some extras.  And he gives her.  He's a good dad.  She's like, she don't.  Yeah.  She don't.  She just got like two dads.  It's a weird thing.  He comes over and picks her up and you two talk at all.  We don't talk.  It's been.  I love to know what happened.  Since years.  Oh, shit.  We talk once by mistake.  And the conversation was like, what up, bro?  Because it's not my responsibility. 
[00:14:00]  No.  I really started off just popping her mom's.  And she was just breathing.  So I had to feed her because I was feeding her mother.  I got to take my kid.  You know, here's her fucking chicken nuggets or whatever she's going to fucking eat.  But as it grows.  I love this.  So is she the only time we ever talk.  This is recently.  We just talked like, wow, maybe. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, three months ago, because my girl had to work.  I'll tell you the scenario.  She had to work.  He had to do something.  I think his mother wasn't available.  And then I was.  I was final option.  I was fucking shit.  I was.  It was Defcon five.  And Defcon five is me and him have to connect.  You two have to talk.  To do something. 
[00:15:00]  And what was that like?  It wasn't uncomfortable.  Why?  I.  Like a little faggot.  I turned off all the lights in my house.  What the?  And I peeked at my door, like, just to let him know the door was open.  And sent her out.  She was basically just like a package.  Just slipped out the door.  Like, all right.  Like, I heard you set her out like it was a ransom.  Like it was a kidnapping.  Like they gave you some pizza in exchange for. 
[00:15:30]  Turned out all the lights, sending the kid out.  It was so uncomfortable because we, we know each other by de facto.  Yeah.  It's a weird thing.  We know each other.  He knows what I do.  He's seen.  Yeah.  He's got to know you more than you know him.  He knows me.  Yeah.  So, but the kid's not, she's, I'm Mr. P.  You know what I'm saying?  So, the kid, she's never coming out go, Miss, he, you know, I know as a, as a father, you're  probably waiting to hear, Mr. P kicked me in the fucking ass.  And, or, or Mr. P came in the, in the room and, uh, weird, like, you know, he's waiting 
[00:16:00]  to hear that shit so he can come over and blow me up.  But he, he's, he knows that she, I take care of the kid, you know, but, uh, she, he dropped  off, but he, I heard him in the cargo tell Mr. P, thank you.  And I go, okay, I open the door, you know, hey bro, what's up?  And, but it was, because we don't speak.  And that's it.  You know, like, and the only reason is because you decide not, does he want to?  Do you think he. 
[00:16:30]  That's, that's not my responsibility.  But do you get the feeling that he wants to talk to you?  I don't think he, I, I think it, there's a lot, there was a lot of weirdness at first.  Yeah.  But I think he's still like, uh, I think now he's like, Ooh, I got rid of her.  Now he feels like, go to his spine with him.  It's crazy bitch here, enjoy.  So, and the, and the kid's crazy too.  So it's like just, they're too nuts.  They're too really crazy.  But we don't, I, I would, I would, I was very careful about being stepping on her father's toes. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  That's why I was just Mr. Nice Guy, not Mr. Discipline, not Mr. Advice.  It was, it was, it was really, it was like touching that story about saying I'm your mother's boss.  I'll kick you both out in the fucking street.  I mean, you know, you put it, you know, but do you understand Mr. P made me put a plate in the sink  or he was going to kick mommy and me out, which is, come on, that's not going to happen.  And, but you got to play that kind of shit.  You got to play them like, you got to play them. 
[00:17:30]  That way she'll always, she'll always take the plate.  So I would have had to really wink at her moms and really throw out and just to get her right.  You know what I mean?  But, um, but I think her father is the same kind of, like, like my girl's so, she's, I don't know.  Like, were you worried about getting kidnapped every five seconds as a kid?  Like, this fucking kid is worried about being kidnapped all the fucking time.  That was big when I, that got big, I'm about seven years younger than me. 
[00:18:00]  That got big when I was a kid.  That got, like, stranger abduction.  Stranger abduction.  All of a sudden at Halloween.  I remember, like, my fifth Halloween, they were like, break all the fucking candy bars apart.  They're going to have pins in them.  You know, like, razor blades and apples.  All that shit got really big.  Somebody really fucked some people up at Halloween because that caught on really quick, man.  Because I do recall being able to do anything.  And just being, you never see kids just wandering around by themselves anymore. 
[00:18:30]  She makes, there's a kid, she has a friend and she has to be her friend.  Yeah, yeah, they're in groups.  It's their made-up friends.  At parents' house, at other kids' houses.  You can't just, you can't just ride your bike in the woods anymore.  Yeah, you can't.  Unless you end up in a shallow grave.  Remember, too, when kidnapping used to just be kidnapping, it wasn't kidnapping and you  get fucked?  No, no.  Kidnapping, murder, ransom.  Yeah.  And, like, I have your kid, give me the money, and you'll get your kid back.  And the kid comes back with something pinned to his chest and fucking cold, but he's alive. 
[00:19:00]  Pick him up at the police station with a cop hat on and an ice cream cone sitting on the  desk.  Like the little razzle.  Kidnappers used to treat you all right.  They'd be like, you're just going to live with us for a while, kid.  You know what I mean?  You'd hang out at the kidnappers.  And then it becomes, you'd get fucked.  You'd get fucking chopped up.  Oh, man.  If you went missing in BJ's.  I remember going missing one time.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I go, I'm just like, hey, elf.  And somebody just gets over, you know, well, the parent, what's your name, kid? 
[00:19:30]  What's your mother's name?  Yeah, yeah.  Mommy, you know.  Mommy.  Well, the parent, what's your name?  I was told not to tell you that.  What's your name, kid?  Patrice.  Well, the parent, and she comes, and she doesn't go, oh, my God, and drop to her knees.  She socks me in the mouth.  Oh, yeah.  For fucking drifting off.  Going off, yeah.  Trying to steal Star Wars figures and embarrassing her.  But now they shut the fucking store that it's, it's whoop, whoop, things are turning. 
[00:20:00]  If your kid gets missing.  They get to the security cameras.  They see every door.  The same thing.  Who was walking out.  How tall the fucking kid was.  But is that, was that always happening?  No.  But we just didn't say shit.  No, no.  The same shit happened with kids that, excuse me, that happened with airlines.  Something bad happened, and they shut everything the fuck down.  They fucked locked down.  Yeah, they're like, that's it, that's it.  I walked out of a store once, I wanted one of those stupid little balsa wood planes with 
[00:20:30]  the rubber band, you know?  So my mother finally gave in and was like, okay.  So she hands it to me, waiting for me to follow her shopping and go to the register and pay for  it and shit.  And I just like had it and went, I'm playing with this.  And walked right out of the fucking store and just started walking down the sidewalk.  Like, I'm going home.  I got no idea what home is, but I'm just walking down the sidewalk.  Fucking like six years old with my little plane in my hand.  And she just comes running up behind me, and I'd gotten a couple of blocks away and shit. 
[00:21:00]  And she comes running up behind me, grabbed my arm, and just fucking like shook me.  What the fuck did you do?  And cursing and shit.  Shook you or punched you, because you're doing a punching.  No, no, she's great.  Oh, she's shaking.  And you're shaking the shit out of me.  And I'm like, yeah, what did I do?  I'm going home.  But it wasn't, you were missing.  No, no.  No, no.  In the store?  What are they going to do?  They were still open for business.  I guarantee you kidnappers talk about kidnapping the way we talk about airport security now.  Remember when you used to just be able to go right to the gate with your family and 
[00:21:30]  say goodbye.  You could wake up 15 minutes before your kidnapping?  You think it started with Adam Walsh?  That was a biggie.  I think that is.  That was a big, well-publicized.  I think that was the.  It was so horrible.  The kickoff, man.  I think that was a kickoff, because that dude got America's Most Wanted, and that was  like.  That Eitan Pates was another one that just dis-fucking-peered.  Who was that?  That was that kid that, a lot of publicity about him. 
[00:22:00]  He just disappeared, never to be found again.  Just disappeared.  And the kids just started just disappearing, and parents are like, eh.  Well, maybe we ought to keep a better eye on these kids.  What year did America's Most Wanted come out?  Because I think that is the year.  That's when it is all.  Oh, it's been on.  Or the kids.  Early 80s.  Right?  At least 20.  Yeah, 25.  At least.  At least.  86.  People are saying.  And they were canceling it one year.  Yeah, one year they just decided, mom. 
[00:22:30]  Here you go.  How do you cancel?  We want to put a spinoff of Married with Children on.  The neighbors go.  Wait a minute.  They're catching fucking murderers and rapists here.  Yeah.  I don't think you understand there's rapists and murderers.  Hold on.  I don't think you understand.  They have a puppet that sits on the couch in the basement, and it talks to people.  It's hilarious.  We got to.  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  Maybe we ought to stick with the murder and rapists catching show.  Yeah.  Like, what will they do?  Have you seen this Nikki Cox chick?  She's smoking.  We got to get this on the air.  Fantastic. 
[00:23:00]  Get her on.  Get her on.  Fuck the dead kids.  I think that's the only thing that keeps you catching criminals, is that show.  Criminals hate that fucking show.  They hate it.  I don't think they would get caught without it.  No.  And it's amazing.  And you watch interviews with some of these criminals.  They can't get away from it.  Like, they go to the farthest corner of East Bumfuck, and there's the TV.  We're looking for your help to catch you. 
[00:23:30]  Is that fucking crazy?  Yeah.  There's a show that comes on called Almost Got Away With It.  Almost Got Away With It.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking great show.  It's the whole show is, I got away with it, and here's how I got fucking caught, man.  It's any crime, though, right?  It's not kidnapping, right?  No, it's murder.  Bank robbery.  Yeah, it's all kind of murder.  Yeah, it's like, I got away.  But you know what I noticed about that show?  They really make it look cool and glamorous.  I was going to say, because you said rapists or charme, there's none of them on it, because 
[00:24:00]  the dudes are talking about it like, they're cool dudes.  They're cool.  Yeah.  Like, I was watching one with a bank robber, and he got this chick involved.  Got a girl involved, was able to talk her into waiting in the parking lot with a radio  and a scanner, and he goes in, and he's got his earphones.  Like, they were a team robbing fucking banks.  And you're almost like, oh, damn.  It's like, Bonnie and Clyde, this is cool shit.  Like, and he's talking, and he's chuckling to the camera.  The real guy is like, yeah, we took about three banks that day. 
[00:24:30]  And it's like, three banks, motherfucker, this guy rules.  What would your crime be, man?  If you had to go, if somebody came in, and they're like, radio's done, you've got to  go into a life of crime, what would you do?  I really think I'd go into bank robbery.  Oh, it'd be the best, right?  Bank robbery just looks fucking intense.  Like, a fucking rush.  No one's getting hurt unless you're the one shooting people, or unless a guard shoots you.  So, but it's like, bank robbery looks so fucking adventurous. 
[00:25:00]  You just can't get away with it, though.  No, I'm not saying you're going to get away with it, but what else are you going to do?  Scam old people.  Yeah.  Old people scams.  That's boring.  But you just want some money.  It's just a little bit of money.  There's so much legwork.  There's so much research.  Like, you've got to find out.  You've got to suck on through their neighbor's mail.  You know who Johnson's next door?  Yes?  Uh, and their son, Bob?  Yes, I know their son, Bob.  Well, he recommended I come over here, because you were checking the mail and noticed they 
[00:25:30]  have a son, Bob.  Now, you've got to come over to the old bag and convince her that Bob told you to talk  to this woman and sell her material.  Yeah.  And then while you're in there with your buddy, you'll unfurl the material and block her  view it.  Yeah.  And then the other person ransacks the house while you're blocking her view with a big  bolt of material.  That's fucking great.  Just do horrible, horrible, great one.  That's great.  That would be the easiest thing to get away with.  Old people are stupid when it comes to that stuff. 
[00:26:00]  They just can't figure out you're being scammed.  Well, they're babies.  Oh, my...  Dude, my parents...  Infants.  My parents are...  You're stealing from old babies and shit.  My parents are in their 60s now.  They got a letter.  They got a letter in the mail.  First of all, in the mail.  Yeah, in the mail.  What the fuck is that?  It said something like, you know, something's wrong with your bank to protect yourself.  You need to reroute your money to this thing.  You know, and it's this whole thing to get you to write a check and put a deposit somewhere 
[00:26:30]  else, right?  They steal your money.  And my mom is telling me the whole story.  And immediately I'm like, Jesus Christ, Mom.  Holy shit.  Do I got to move back in with you to protect you?  And she literally gets all the way up to the part in the story where they're reading  the phone number to call and thinking about calling it.  And my dad's got, like, the phone in his hand to transfer this money.  And she's like, at this point, I said, Joe, we better look into this.  We better just...  I'm like, yeah, you think so?  Yeah, at this point... 
[00:27:00]  You got a fucking handwritten letter in the mail that said, leave $3,000 of your money  on this corner, please.  But people still click the shaky thing where it says, you know, you get the instinct to  click that where it goes, there's a virus on your computer.  Oh, that...  You have the instinct to click that fucking thing.  And that the X on there is not to get out of it.  When you click that X, you're in. 
[00:27:30]  That's the clicky thing, too.  They put the clicky thing on the X.  Oh, that's...  Yeah, that's a bad one.  So it's easy to scam a motherfucker.  That's why if I see something like that, I'll do the Control-Alt-Delete and go to the,  you know...  You don't use Macs?  Yeah, I do.  You have a Mac.  Yeah, but for Windows...  Macs...  They don't get viruses.  I swear I think my Mac has a virus.  It's running slow.  I think I clicked too much foul shit is on it.  Too much foul.  It's poison.  Oh, yes, they do. 
[00:28:00]  I know Macs get some viruses, but it's not like Windows.  Shut up.  No, it just isn't.  It isn't.  Is that one of the calls you're not going to take?  Yeah, yeah, that's one of the calls.  I'm not taking.  That's one of the fucking things I'm not taking.  You know, Macs do.  There's the virus of 19 fucking 98 that infected...  I've had a Mac for years.  I've looked at more pornography on my Mac.  Oh.  And nary a problem.  And then Windows, you look at fucking a Sears ad with a bra on it. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, dude.  And you're fucking infected.  Dude, I have a thing in my act about my PC and my Mac, and just talking about how my  PC literally is so fucking afraid of the viruses that it literally shuts the...  It'll shut porn sites down without asking me.  And meanwhile, my Mac's in the corner, like, doing fucking lines.  Like, let's cruise this fucking pussy, dude.  What are we doing here?  What do you need, man?  I'll hook you up.  Let's go, man.  That's why I'm frivolous with the Mac shit.  Because the dude told me, when I bought it, he said, that's the reason we are the shit. 
[00:29:00]  If we get a virus, we're now just PCs.  Yeah.  If anybody figures out how to give us a virus, that's how we are the shit.  So, you know, I just said, after he told me that, I'm just...  I click like...  I don't feel like...  I just click anything.  I don't feel like anything really bad is going to happen to my Mac, no matter what I click on.  But I don't feel like I'm going to get this fucked up virus or anything. 
[00:29:30]  But Windows...  I look at my Mac like I look at AIDS.  I'm like...  It can't happen to me.  There's no condom on my Mac.  I'm diving right in.  There's some weird way I'm trying to get a virus on it, though.  Like...  Yeah.  Just really unprotected anal sex with a Haitian homosexual.  Yeah, you want to test it.  I'm really trying to fucking get something on this Mac so I can go, mmm, and let everybody know.  Or, in my weird daydream, like, go pay me $10 million. 
[00:30:00]  You can have my fucking thing and...  Yeah, look what happened.  Yeah, I won't say nothing.  I'll sign something, give me $10 million.  I don't even want $50 million.  I don't want even...  Just $10 million.  You want it quiet?  Yeah.  Give me that.  Give me $10 million.  And I'll give you the computer.  Serious, man.  I'd click anything.  You think they're doing that?  Steve Jobs fucking knocks on your door.  Look, we found out you have a virus.  We really don't need this getting out.  I do a lot of fucking weird clicking, man.  Yeah.  On my fucking Mac. 
[00:30:30]  A lot of weird clicking.  Well, I've talked about it before.  It doesn't matter what you start off doing.  You will end up in pornography.  Oh, yeah.  On the way.  It just...  You always end up...  I go sometimes with the greatest intentions of, you know, paying bills or getting my registration  renewed online.  And a couple of clicks in, you're like, what is that?  Yeah.  Click.  Exactly.  There's a little banner ad with girls in your area.  What is that?  Phony shit. 
[00:31:00]  I'm not even...  I'm going to see how dumb, phony this is.  And then you click it, and it brings up another page, and it's like, ooh, amateurs.  Yeah.  And anything will set me off when I'm online.  I...  Like, if I'm actually with a girl, I can't come forever.  I'm so jaded from porn.  But as soon as I'm online, I'm like, that chick in the TD Bank ad is turning me on.  I'm right...  Right over to fucking Tube 8.  Can I say, there's some new porno shit going on? 
[00:31:30]  What?  Called Tubes.  Yeah, yeah.  But ain't...  Tube 8...  It's bigger than Tube 8.  Yeah.  There's a lot of them.  It's like a search engine of...  Of...  Of Tube 8s.  Of any Tube 8s out there.  And you...  And they just have 12,000 categories.  How amazing is it that it's free now?  It's...  We went through that phase where you had to pay for everything but a thumbnail.  This is a good one, but it's a...  Yeah, remember when you'd go to the fucking porn site, or the porn store, and to get the 
[00:32:00]  good porn, it was like $50, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  $30 for fucking VHS.  A VHS tape with that box with the glossy pictures on it and shit.  I remember my buddy telling me we were in, like, college, dude.  It wasn't even that long ago.  Like, 10 fucking years ago, 11 years ago, my buddy would buy the $50 and $30 ones.  And I was like, dude, I can't spend that money, man.  And he goes, dude, it's worth it to me, man.  These fucking things are quality, dude.  Like...  And I was always jealous that I didn't have that, like, resolve. 
[00:32:30]  Like, I couldn't get myself to get my money together.  Fought that money over.  Yeah, I was always buying the shit, like, three for ten.  Awful.  And it was crap.  Awful.  One thing I don't want to do while I'm jacking off is get that shot right when the things  are getting good of the guy's face going, oh.  The guy's face.  At this point, I don't even, like, you know, you'd be like, oh, I'm not gay.  But at this point, you know, balls don't even throw you off no more.  And you don't even think about it.  I used to throw you a little bit. 
[00:33:00]  Like, you go, hey, man, you know.  Come on, more pussy, right, guys?  But I hate lesbian porn.  Bella Donna's the only lesbian porn I can watch.  And, like, because she acts like a dude kind of thing.  But other than that, I can't.  I walk, this is how bad it is.  I was walking down 8th one time coming from the restaurant I go over there.  And I'm walking past the place where I used to buy all my DVDs.  And the dude goes, he runs out.  See, he goes, where you been? 
[00:33:30]  I go, dude, I can find any.  You find full length.  On this thing where I go, they give you an option.  They go, say you go, okay, I'm going to type in African ass.  Okay.  Anyway, it gives you a choice.  Popularity, date it was uploaded, or duration.  Yeah.  And if you pick up the, if you click the duration, they have fucking videos that's two hours. 
[00:34:00]  How much time you got?  You got a minute?  Or do you have two hours?  Two hours.  How fast do you got to do this?  Yeah, you got all day to hang out with me, or just a minute, and then you got to run.  I jerked off to something on, it, it, there was two things I jerked off to, and that bothered me.  One was a Japanese, that bothered me when I jerked off to it, but it was so, like, I don't know what, it got me.  And, uh.  On some level.  Yeah, it makes you hate yourself, dude. 
[00:34:30]  It's like, oh, wow, what the fuck are you jerking off to?  But I jerked off, I jerked off the, uh, to, one was to, uh,  Japanese girls squirting titty milk on each other in a bathtub.  I don't, I don't know why that got me when it got me.  Why would that get you turned on at all?  It just was weird.  I think because it was serious.  That would be an instant click off of it.  I'd be like, what the fuck?  Get the fuck.  It was a weird, like, because they wasn't going, ooh, yeah.  It was just, one would squirt, and then the other one would taste it and go, aye! 
[00:35:00]  Like, dead serious.  It was very unsexual.  Well, that's what the thing about Japanese porn is very, there's no sexuality to it.  It's just a lot of weird, it's weird and awkwardness.  Japanese porn has killed my boner so many fucking times.  When I go, I'm in a mood for a nice Asian, and then I go watch Japanese porn, I'm like,  God damn, it's clinical, man.  It is unsexy.  There's no passion to it.  No fucking, uh, no, like, uh, the girl isn't like, you know, grabbing cock and just fucking. 
[00:35:30]  And that was like, they're weeping.  You're weeping.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the whole thing over there is like, you know, respectful woman, servitude.  Yeah.  You know, act like you're crying, like you've never accepted a dick before.  It's like, this fucking grizzly whore.  I saw her in six videos this week.  I don't buy it.  Like, don't give me the baby in the woods routine, Karen.  Yeah, yeah.  We know where you've been.  That, what was the other one that got you a little fucking shaking? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, it may not be anything, but it bothered me.  It's a seven minute clip.  He knows the duration.  And it was seven minutes of hell.  I can tell you, me and my boys thought we'd never see the light of day.  I can't even tell you how I got there.  I wasn't looking for it.  It just ended up being there.  It sounds like Da Nang.  It was seven minutes, but we just saw him come in the perimeter. 
[00:36:30]  This doesn't sound like you enjoyed it at all.  Sorry, bro.  It's an old lady who's walking down the street with a fucking shopping bag.  No.  And a van pulls up next to her.  How old?  She's old.  How old?  Shit, man.  She's old.  Danny just wrote Patrice was in the shit.  Yeah, he was in the shit.  We were in the shit. 
[00:37:00]  In the shit on this one, man.  We didn't think we were getting out.  How old was she, dude?  Old mama-san is walking down the street.  Be careful, by the way.  This old lady was walking down the street, and somebody squirted a titty milk on her, and  she went, aye, and then they threw her in a van.  How old was she?  She could have been younger.  Yeah.  But the portrayal was, and she was an old lady.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  But she could have been younger, but the portrayal was about 70.  Oh, okay.  I knew that was going to be bad, because you really danced around it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's nothing about a 70-year-old that is sexy.  I don't care what she's doing.  It's like dusk, and she's walking around with a bag, and a van pulls up next to her.  Oh, shit.  And hops out the guy.  I'm watching this, and I'm already getting ready to click off, but he throws her in the  van.  You can hear the thud.  And then he throws, he gets ready to close the door, and he throws her bag in the van 
[00:38:00]  with her, and then pushes her in further with his feet, and then slams the van.  It was so real.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he just takes her into a fucking garage, and just tears this old lady's panty, and  fucks the shit out of her.  And she's just going, ah!  Oh, God. 
[00:38:30]  I know!  I know!  The entire seven minutes.  She's fucking the shit out of this guy.  It's just some old lady.  How old was the guy?  He had to be, he was a big, one of them big Russians.  So he probably was, he looked like he was 28.  I must crush you.  I must break you.  Russians will fuck anything.  And she, he was fucking the shit, and she was just taking it, and he kept her, she had  an old lady coat still on, and her old lady hat, and she was old.  Like an old I Love Lucy type hat on. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, God.  Ricky makes her take back.  Viv Vance.  Vivian Vance.  He threw Vivian Vance in the van.  And she looked like Vivian.  William Froll, he jumped back.  You know what it was?  Betty White.  That was rich.  He was fucking the shit out of Betty White.  And it was so fucking weird.  They got Viv.  Yeah.  Viv got raped last night.  I don't think she's going to be in for the scene today, Desi.  All the way to set.  They took her to her garage.  They raped her for seven minutes. 
[00:39:30]  That was the duration.  That was so weird.  Vivian Vance.  Wow, Patrice.  That's fucking sick shit to watch, though.  And it didn't even come.  I watched every second of it.  You were waiting for a money shot.  That pussy felt like wood chips.  It just ended.  A mulch.  And she just was, like, she was in character of old lady.  Yeah.  But the name of the thing, the name of the site that made me feel better, because it was so well done, was horny grannies. 
[00:40:00]  It's like, it was a, you know.  So it was meant for that format.  It was just.  Wasn't like one of those sites where look at what we found and threw it up there.  There's two girls.  There's two girls.  Brittany and Whitney Stevens.  Girls, if you're listening, I love you so much.  They're sisters.  And they're, like, three years apart.  And that's the thing that I was like, I should have never watched this man.  Because I've followed them from their first clip up until now, over their however many year career they've had. 
[00:40:30]  And in their very first clip they ever did together, they started out just by, like, they'd grab each other.  There's tit just a little bit.  A little playful.  Just a little bit.  Oh.  And, dude, they now, in their videos, make out with each other.  They rub each other's clits.  They suck each other's tit.  And it's the.  They're sharing cum.  Dude, it's the.  Dude, they do the fucking.  What's that called?  When one takes the cum in the mouth and spits it in the other girl's mouth.  Spits it out in the other girl's mouth.  Dude.  Wow. 
[00:41:00]  They are the hottest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.  And it's.  I'm like, I can't.  Damn.  I'm scarred.  Watch it, though.  You should watch it.  Yeah, well, obviously.  Huh?  That's it?  That made you feel fine.  It's real sisters being incestuous, man.  Fucking sissy, nigga.  You bug me.  Fuck you.  That titty milk thing wasn't anything.  And the other thing was so psychotic, I don't want to ever fucking go there.  I'll be a sissy.  I'll be a sissy if I'm not coming to a 70-year-old fucking golden girl getting raped in a garage 
[00:41:30]  van.  Two cute sisters made you feel bad?  You fucking lame?  No, because they're being incestuous.  And once you see that, you can't watch regular lesbians or anything.  You want to see sisters.  I'm on the fucking web every day.  How do you know they're sisters?  Because they goddamn look alike.  They're sisters, dude.  They're sisters.  Because they look alike?  They've also.  It's been.  It's all over the fucking web.  They're sisters.  I want to see the fucking.  I want to see the fucking ID.  Look at them right over here.  I want a DNA test.  They're fucking sisters.  Out of their mouths. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Do they?  Let me see.  Let's see a good picture.  They're fucking great, dude.  Look at those two.  Those two bitches are just the same.  Ugly.  Fuck you.  And they're ugly.  It was bothering me, too.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  Ugly?  They fucking are.  They look like two open mic bitches.  Like these.  Yeah.  Them bringer comics.  They look like.  Oh, shit.  You bug me, Joe.  Yeah.  You just bug me with the story.  You're not digging them?  They suck.  They're a little.  They're just a tad out of shape. 
[00:42:30]  They're in better shape, though.  They thin down.  They were both a little husky when they first started.  I don't mind a tad out of shape.  That's cool.  Dude, they're the fucking greatest.  But you see that shit now?  I'm fucking typing sisters into every goddamn porn search.  Oh, really?  It's not healthy.  You shouldn't be looking at fucking family members doing shit together.  It's not right.  Well, if they're going to do it, put it on, and they're not being, you know, coerced into it.  When you grew up, you didn't want to see two sisters?  No, I still want to see it.  It doesn't, but I love it.  Even Fonzie wanted, like, the twins. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, you want to fuck the twins.  It was a family show.  All right, I'm fine.  Patrice, you're fucked up.  I'm all right.  I like the, uh...  I'm pretty basic when it comes to smut.  My smut.  I like, uh...  Young.  Like, regular girls kind of laying on the bed where you could see their entire body kind  of naked, kind of fucking with themselves a little bit.  That's the creep in you.  Is it the creep in me?  You're an old creep.  I just like the...  And I like their eyes have to be looking at the camera lens, so it looks like they're 
[00:43:30]  looking at you.  You're an old creep.  That's why I...  Fuck you, old lady fucking watching...  Yeah, how is that creepier than sisters?  I'm not judging you.  That's just like if I call somebody fat, that doesn't mean that...  Like, they go, what about you?  Well, just because I'm fat doesn't mean you're not fat.  I have eyes.  I'm saying...  What is the creep factor in that, by the way?  The creep factor is...  You're not even thinking about really smashing it.  It's more scientific.  You're looking at this girl with, what can I do to her eyes? 
[00:44:00]  It's not like, oh, I want to hold her.  It's more like, hmm, I wonder if there's ever been a thumb right in her ass.  No, nothing crazy like that.  The fantasies aren't crazy like that.  It's more like, I kind of like, you know, the look.  It's very visual.  I'm not very fantasy-minded when it comes to porno to think like, oh, this is the next  and then that.  I just like looking.  I've always liked looking at that shit.  It's great.  Like, visual. 
[00:44:30]  I'm very visually...  I'm actually jealous of you that it's that tame.  I really am.  Really?  Yeah, I wish...  You know what, though?  It's crazy.  I gotta say, man...  I do it at the library, though.  Pop it up there and just start beating off on the card catalog.  I had a fucking perverted streak ever since I started whacking off.  Like, I remember as a kid, like, I couldn't watch, like...  Like, my friends would have these, like, Playboy videos of Jenny McCarthy and  shit.  And I was like, I don't...  What are you jerking off to?  Like, her tit?  Like, I gotta see...  Oh, really?  You couldn't even deal with that? 
[00:45:00]  Just the tit?  No, I needed to see a good, stiff dick in somebody's mouth.  A fucking?  Yeah.  Look at how hot that is right there.  Which one?  Right there.  Ah, that's good.  This is the...  She's gotta figure up her ass right there.  Who is that, Danny?  No, they're glass ones.  Really?  Because I never had glass ones up in my ass before.  Oh, I love her.  Who is that chick on Brazzers?  Whoa!  Yeah, this ad's going.  There's like...  Every page you pull up, there's like ten things going on. 
[00:45:30]  Dude, every time I do this show, I gotta run home and beat off after.  Yeah, we're sexy.  So much fucking porn just coming out of the bodies.  Yeah, it's a psychological profile.  I never did it and understand about women.  Yeah.  This girl is so...  Is it always something happened to them?  Why?  Because she's a lot...  She's so filthy.  She can't be 22.  Yeah, yeah.  And she's just smashing her own finger in her asshole. 
[00:46:00]  And now this grown act, this grown...  And you know, that's a grown man knuckle.  Yeah, yeah.  Just veins.  Going right up her fucking asshole.  And you're like, is she regular?  Like, can't women...  Can there be...  There's nothing where women...  Did I get you?  There's nothing where women stand up and kind of go,  Hey, I just like a motherfucker sticking her finger in my ass.  I know I haven't been touch funny.  I'm not crazy.  Yeah.  I just love this.  Oh, shit.  Now she's licking the guy's finger that was just in her pooper. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, this girl is despicable, but I mean that with love.  Because you've got a lot of dirty names.  No, it's the old, it's the old, what's the matter with kids today thing.  It's just...  What's the matter with kids today?  It's just...  This is just like anything else, man.  That, like, it's all accelerated.  I mean, think about it, dude.  You've got a generation of kids now with the access to porn that we have.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  If you're 15 and you're looking at that shit,  you're going to be a dirty fucking animal by the time you're 17.  You know what I mean?  Like, you're like, this is what you do. 
[00:47:00]  It was the hunt for fucking porn years ago,  and now it's just readily available on your phone.  And they used to be...  On your phone.  And they used to have...  X to triple X.  Yeah, yeah.  You couldn't see a girl have some 40-year-old man finger her asshole  and then lick the finger off in the 80s?  They didn't do that shit back then.  And here's the turn.  I've been watching porn so fucking long.  I don't know what's wrong.  I mean, I've really been a porn watcher, like it's been cartoon.  Aficionado, yes. 
[00:47:30]  Here's what changed.  The biggest change from when I was watching porn as a youngin to now,  there's no such thing as women porn stars anymore.  It went into from Vanessa Del Rio fucking a lot of guys that you don't know  to a dude's name that I know fucking a lot of women that I never heard of.  Like, this girl here, whoever she is, it's like, who is she?  She's just not a porn star.  She's just a girl on the floor looking at a camp. 
[00:48:00]  Miraculously sucking at her.  It's not even a girl anymore.  It's the category of what she's doing.  She's doing POV right now, and it's the style of what she's doing that's the porno.  That's the star.  It's the style.  You don't look for a name.  You don't look for that.  You look for, okay, I like fucking, you know, amateur fucking voyeur, shit like that.  But that's not true. 
[00:48:30]  I saw Nina Hartley talking about that and about the web.  She says the same, it was funny to listen to her talk about it, because she talked about  the web the way comedians and musicians talk about iTunes and all that shit.  She was like, look, it's fucking great.  You get your shit out there immediately, but every asshole with a video camera now can put  himself online.  But there's porn stores, it's just harder to rise to the top with everything else.  There's still fucking, you've had them in here.  What's her favorite?  Brie Olsen?  Yeah, but they're older girls. 
[00:49:00]  They're not fucking 18, 19, 20-year-old porn stars.  They're girls from the fucking, the last generation of porno.  Brie Olsen's like 22 years old.  Isn't she?  Aurora Snow?  How old's Brie?  She's been in here, yeah.  I mean, but.  But tell me, look, there's, of course there's.  No?  No.  You know, of course there's like, it's fucking.  Yeah, you're going to have some exceptions, but.  Yeah, but I'm saying as a whole.  For the most part.  You didn't have a bunch of, in this, doing porn as a woman back in the 80s was, like, 
[00:49:30]  you were, you were a renegade.  You know, man, you were.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm coming in porn, it's like, this was a huge, a huge deal.  Yeah.  Now, now it's like, eh, dabbling some porn for a while.  And I can make a porn with Brie, that's the thing.  If you go to wherever.  That's a good point.  Wherever you, she gets paid fucking probably 1,200 bucks.  Yeah.  Depending, if she's big time, you know, two G's, a fuck. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  A scene, you know, 1,300 a scene.  And, and, you know, girls are doing so much shit, like, like, cream pies was a huge deal  when I can, now cream pies is, it's all that.  And, you know, cream pies, like, girls are taking it, like, they're just taking cum.  Anywhere, anywhere it comes.  Anywhere it comes.  It's amazing.  They're just taking cum and they're taking, and it's these, these bukkakis and these gangbanks.  But you never thought of getting a porn star, like, that it was actually in the realm of 
[00:50:30]  possibility to fuck a porn star growing up.  You're right.  And looking at the magazine.  You're right.  Patrice is right.  If you've got enough money, situation, whatever, you want to film a scene with her?  It's not out of the question.  All you got to do is come off professional.  Yeah.  Like they're not prostitutes.  Right.  Like if you go, hey, listen, I'll give you, how much you make for a scene?  Oh, blah, blah, blah.  All right, I'll give you that right now.  So I'm going to dig over it.  It's insulting. 
[00:51:00]  Those chicks, yeah, remember when porn stars used to have to work the road?  Like they'd go to the fucking, they would like be.  Like comics, yeah, they're just working the road.  There was a club in my college town called Al's Diamond Cabaret, and it was just this  little strip club in fucking Redding, Pennsylvania, Redding.  Nice.  Which, you know, no hate on Redding, but Redding's not a metropolis, you know what I mean?  And there was goddamn porn stars there dancing when I was in college. 
[00:51:30]  Like, and I mean, like, who's the chick that was married to the guy from Biohazard?  Oh, Tara Patrick.  Like Tara Patrick level.  She might have even fucking been there, but like, you just feel like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Like these chicks got to go out and fucking hammer the goddamn street.  Dancing and taking pictures with disgusting guys in their clubs.  That's the thing with porn now, too, though.  Porn is like, porn is like everything else in the culture.  Like, there's no fiction anymore.  There's no line between reality and fiction. 
[00:52:00]  Everything is real.  Like, if you watch one of those fucking, like, you know, you know, some porn from the 80s  called, like, Notorious or some shit like that.  Yeah.  And you find a clip online, it'll say, it'll say, aunt, niece and aunt scene from Notorious.  And you watch, you go, those bitches are the same age.  They're not an aunt, niece and aunt.  And then there's a storyline, a little storyline.  If you find the clip now and it's like mom, daughter, you're like, that's the fucking  mom and the daughter.  That's real.  They look alike.  There's family pictures behind them and the fucking back. 
[00:52:30]  It's all fucking completely real now, man.  I had a good way.  This is a category, drooling cream pies.  Very specific.  Yes, very specific.  And I'm a big drooling cream pie fan.  But I, you know, I jerked off to not, they do these things called Not Your Something.  They do a sitcom version of it.  Not, this ain't your, this ain't good times. 
[00:53:00]  What the fuck is that?  It was phenomenal with people playing, somebody was playing Florida.  Somebody was playing James.  And it turns into porn.  Somebody was playing JJ and they was doing the characters and JJ's like.  Jimmy Walker was actually playing JJ in it.  Everybody was doing their fucking little thing that they do.  And he's like, hey, I got to paint your ass, right?  I'm going to paint a picture of your ass.  And then, and then the girl's like, well, he goes, but you got to pull your panties down 
[00:53:30]  just a little bit more, you know, dig it.  And she says, is this better?  And it's just like, he's like, oh, much better.  Dino-mite.  Of course, Dino-mite.  And then he starts fucking, you know, or Thelma.  I've never heard of this shit.  This ain't the Cosby's.  This ain't good times.  This ain't married with children.  Is it close?  Do they get like.  Jesus Christ.  This ain't the Brady Bunch.  Do they get the actors like close or is it just like.  Close.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  There's a bitch had the Florida wig on.  James.  And she looked like Florida.  What's JJ fucking Thelma saying?  Thelma was sucking Bookman's dick because he was going to throw him out the house.  So she's like, is there anything I can do to stay in the, he said, I'm going to throw  your whole family out.  And she says, is there anything I can do, Bookman?  She had to suck Buffalo Bunch's dick.  She had to suck Buffalo Bunch's dick to stay in.  Jesus Christ.  JJ is getting his dick sucked.  That's great.  James and, and James in Florida was fucking. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, it's tremendous, man.  That's fucking hysterical.  Yeah.  They do look like it.  Good times.  How do they get away with copyright infringement?  I don't know.  Who's suing them?  Where the fuck?  Who do you, like, you think Norman Lear would come up and go, look, what do you go to Van  Nuys, California to just back up?  Evasive angles will be in fucking Florida tomorrow.  Oh my God, man.  It's so hot, man.  It's night.  It's so fucking.  Original sounds right. 
[00:55:00]  Bill Cosby must have had a fucking stroke when he heard about This Ain't the Cosby.  Oh, well, the dude that does This Ain't the Cosby's is a comedian who does Bill Cosby's.  Dude.  Really?  You gotta find This Ain't the Cosby's clip.  Find some This Ain't the Cosby's.  Please, God.  Which comedian?  Thomas.  Thomas Ward.  Fantastic idea.  I've never heard of him.  Thomas Ward is Cosby, but he doesn't fuck.  He doesn't do any fucking, but he plays Cosby.  Because Thomas' whole thing was, we would go, nigga, you look like Bill Cosby. 
[00:55:30]  And he hated that shit.  So he did anything to not be Bill Cosby, but he does a great Cosby impression, and he looks  just like Bill Cosby.  And he's like, she's in the bed, and he's just like, you.  And there's a bunch of porn stars acting like Rudy and acting like.  Oh, shit.  You gotta find it, man, Danny.  Oh, I gotta hear a clip of this.  You gotta hear him.  Talk about a dude tapping out, too.  He couldn't stand it when they said he looked like Bill Cosby, and then he plays Bill Cosby 
[00:56:00]  in a porno movie.  In his brain, Joe, it's acting somehow to him.  Oh, it's an acting gig, yeah.  He thinks because he didn't fuck that this is showcasing.  Yeah, he got a show.  He was on the AVN Awards.  Would you do that?  Would you do a straight roll on a porno?  I would do that as a goof.  Listen, at this point in my career, they wouldn't know it was funny.  That just fucking, that wrecks you, though.  I would never show my dick on film.  That'll wreck you. 
[00:56:30]  You gotta find it.  Will it, though?  Yeah.  Oh, we don't see the...  It's right after the one with the foot on the girl's head, then.  I mean, Anthony, is it any worse than me watching E-Rock smell Bobo's dick on the radio?  Yeah, I know.  It's just something different about radio.  I think it ruins...  Like, who is...  There's been a couple of people that have done that stupid fucking Girls Gone Wild thing.  Stanhope did it.  Stanhope did it.  Yeah.  And when I watched it, I was like, oh... 
[00:57:00]  And I even told Doug when he was in.  I'm like, you did that Girls Gone Wild thing.  He goes, yeah, that sucks, man.  Hey, Ant, there's this...  That's the guy...  Oh, no!  Look at his fucking...  He does look like Cosby.  What the fuck is he doing, man?  And then he's just going like...  He's a comedian.  Rudy's getting the bitch cock in her ass.  She's sucking dick.  What's going on over here? 
[00:57:30]  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  The vegetables love to fuck, dear.  Wow.  Dude, you gotta see the scenes, though.  Yeah, I absolutely have gotta see that.  He's fucking hilarious.  And then Rudy fucks.  He gives Rudy a, like, you know, you can't.  You gotta go to school.  And she goes, and she's sucking dick.  When the family goes out, she pretends us to be sick or something.  And then the family goes out for, like, a family outing.  And they leave, like, Vanessa, the Vanessa girl home. 
[00:58:00]  And she sneaks a guy in the room and fucks the shit out of him and everybody.  And then Cosby comes in and goes...  This is so fucked up.  Yeah, I'm home.  I'm hurting.  Wait, is that really Bill Cosby or is that the porno?  That's the porno guy.  That's him.  I'll crank it up.  Let's see.  He looks...  Dude.  We didn't get sued for the first time.  Oh.  Wow.  And there's the family.  But look who plays...  Uh, Theo.  Theo. 
[00:58:30]  And he's doing...  The guy who's doing the Cosby dance that he does in the beginning of the...  Oh, my God.  That guy looks just like fucking Cosby.  Dude, Thomas Ward.  If you said he looked like Cosby before he did this, he'd knock you in the mouth.  The beginning looks just like the beginning of the Cosby.  Dude, I literally couldn't tell him and Bill Cosby apart.  No.  I thought that was actually Bill Cosby.  Thomas looks like Bill Cosby's son.  Fucked.  And then they just get stuck fucking?  And he doesn't bang Mrs. Huxtable in it? 
[00:59:00]  He doesn't fuck.  Does Mrs. Huxtable bang in it?  Yeah.  I didn't see the whole thing, but I know...  Is that Rudy?  That's Vanessa.  That's Vanessa.  She always said the...  That's Rudy.  Jesus Christ.  How old is Rudy?  Rudy's probably 18 or 19.  This is terrible.  She's just teeny.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And the older...  The only guy fucking...  What's his face?  Who was the light-skinned husband?  The older sister. 
[00:59:30]  What was his name?  Isn't that Elvin?  Elvin.  They got fucking Elvin in it.  Oh, that's as loud as it goes.  Well, how did Theo do on his first day at the office?  He was spectacular.  This is an examination table.  It is not a toy.  And I don't want to see you riding it like a bull.  How often do you get laid?  Not a welcome.  That's Theo.  Theo's eating pussy. 
[01:00:00]  And that's cockroach.  I left you all alone with a beautiful, naked girl from Spain.  My man.  That's an 80s dancer.  I need her to help me fix this puzzle.  He goes, where did Rudy go?  She's upstairs taking her panties off.  It's like a dick.  Can I take a day tonight?  I thought I was going to get a little chocolate pudding.  The last guy that didn't show up for work, he ended in the bottom of the Hudson River. 
[01:00:30]  I'm sorry to bother you when you're studying, but I'm in a bit of trouble.  Strippers?  Prostitutes?  That is, uh, that's Lisa Bonet.  Lisa Bonet character.  Jesus Christ.  He's a tip off the old rock.  That guy just does a ridiculous Cosmic.  And they got the whole set.  This is like high budget.  Dude.  This ain't good times.  It's even better. 
[01:01:00]  That is just...  There you go again.  Amazing.  And then he comes in the bitch's mouth and goes,  I know my...  What's his face?  Looks like...  Sitcomes.com.  Oh, here you go.  Sitcomes.  Sitcomes.  You know, they just ran out of ideas and somebody thought this will be great.  Not MASH.  Not the Bradys.  Not the Bradys.  I think they have to say that maybe not to get sued.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:01:30]  Not Charlie's Angels.  I'm stunned.  I never thought there was this category.  Or is that not the Bradys?  Yes, it comes.  Oh, not Charlie's Angels.  Not Charlie's Angels.  You can't...  Wait, there's a...  There's an announcement.  The leading ladies have been announced for not Charlie's Angels in the porn industry.  Oh, wow.  Must have been a big day.  Oh, it was big time, man.  Big time to be announced as one of the angels.  Yeah.  I wonder who got Bosley.  Fucking...  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Look at that guy.  That guy could have been a real actor.  Not Airplane.  XXX Flight Attendance.  God, this is a huge fucking little category.  Yeah, they started not...  The big one is not married with children.  Yeah.  And the dude who played...  He won Best Actor, I think, this year.  Oh, really?  The guy who played Bundy...  Yeah.  ...was fucking funny.  Al.  He fucking...  He said, I'm gonna play this shit and do it well.  I'm really gonna fucking play it up, Al Bundy. 
[01:02:30]  You got it?  It is...  Now I'm gonna be looking at these fucking things.  Oh, they're hilarious, dude.  You can't top that Cosby one, man.  It's so wrong.  It's so fucking wrong.  Rudy just looked too young and...  Married with children had actual porn stars.  Not married with children.  The guy who played fucking Bundy is hilarious.  Wow.  Look at Peg, man.  Peg looks like Peg.  They use the same logo and everything.  Like, how did they fucking not just get sued?  Because it's out there.  It's porn.  They're so... 
[01:03:00]  It's such a hustle that...  Who are they gonna sue?  It's like boiler room stuff.  They go to serve a subpoena and the warehouse is empty.  You know how many fucking parents...  Their kids are like into porn...  Like, they want to stop it, but there's...  Yeah.  How do you stop the porn industry?  There's a law that states if you create something that's obviously meant for parody,  it's not copyright infringement.  It's not stealing.  You can't get sued for it.  Not to Cosby's.  Yeah.  But they're getting motherfuckers. 
[01:03:30]  They got your boy Max Hardcore.  Oh, Max Hardcore got nailed.  And cartoon porn, they were on the attack for cartoon porn.  Oh, because children will look at the pretty colors.  But Max is like, anything that's depicted, like, you can't have chicks running around  with pigtails and all that shit, because it's like, it's depicted as...  It's fetishy stuff, though.  Right.  Obviously, they're up to age.  But they got his ass.  He's in jail for that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Amazing.  Well, let's go jerk off for a little while. 
[01:04:00]  We'll take a break.  I'm going to tell you, I was thinking about you the other day in Cleveland, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  I wanted to tell you about what I was thinking about.  Damn.  We'll talk to you about it.  Right.  It had something to do with a computer, too.  Oh, nice.  I wasn't jerking off to you.  And a couple of things I found interesting is this fucking Lady Gaga, as I call her, Lady  Gaga.  I'm sick of her.  She's fucking...  Now I'm completely fucking...  I've had it with her, with her political stance now on the Mexicans and Arizona shit. 
[01:04:30]  She starts yelling that shit from the stage.  And who the fuck is she to even know what's going on?  Well, what's she yelling?  Dunce.  Ah, well, she's against it.  And I'm asking people to protest the bill.  And so, well, what is she...  You're a fucking dummy that dresses up stupid.  So I definitely want to hear some...  We have some of her comments.  I hate her.  It was the funniest retort. 
[01:05:00]  You go, who the fuck is she to comment on this?  What the fuck does she...  You're a dummy, you stupid.  I like being concise.  Here's my stance on Lady Gaga.  She's a cunt.  Yes.  Fuck her.  Anthony's like, fuck that bitch.  Puts a fucking funnel on her head and dumb glasses made out of a rabbit.  She has the right to have an opinion, Anthony.  Yeah, but not the right to have it fucking played on every news thing and it's bullshit.  This is what I hate about her. 
[01:05:30]  It's her dumb character she always does.  And then people go, it's music, it's fantastic.  And I go, yeah, but it's annoying.  They go, well, Bowie did it.  No, no, no.  Bowie did it for one album as a character after he was David Bowie.  This fucking dumb cunt is walking around wearing tinfoil hats all the fucking time.  She's being this character all the time.  Oh, she bugs me, man.  She doesn't go home and act like this.  Stop.  And then I just love to hear the Mexican thing.  She probably knows so much about it. 
[01:06:00]  We'll do that.  And I'll eat my sandwich and we'll be right back after these words.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show is now back on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Yes, it is indeed the Opie and Anthony show with a very loud bed.  Bow, bow.  Yeah.  Fucking A.  Opie's not in. 
[01:06:30]  We talked about that earlier.  Gary's a little sickly, a little sickly.  So we got Joe DeRosa and Patrice O'Neal here having fun with the rest of our wonderful cast of characters like Sam.  And, of course, Danny and Travis or T-Storm.  Oh, Travis is in?  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  T-Storm.  I know.  I didn't see Travis through.  There's a lot of glare.  Sorry, bro.  Yeah.  What a controversy.  I've whipped up with... 
[01:07:00]  We'll talk about your Evo.  Oh, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  We can't move on until he explains his Evo.  I got no problem with that.  Can we...  Please, Joe.  Talk about the Evo.  So proud during break to talk about his Evo.  He said, I got the last Evo.  No one gave a shit.  Well, it's...  I'm listening, dude.  Let me...  Stole the virtues of the Evo.  Let me get my ice water ready.  I got to listen to this.  It's become apparent to me that when something nice happens in your life and you want to share 
[01:07:30]  it with your friends, they choose to mock and ridicule you.  If that's the way you guys want to live your lives, that's your business.  Yeah.  Enough of your fucking diversionary tactics 101, bitch.  Talk about the Evo.  It's a great fucking phone.  It's got the biggest screen.  It's got an HDMI out.  You can plug it right into your TV and watch it.  All the shit you shoot on your phone, your videos, all that shit.  Watch it right on your TV.  It's got a voice.  I'm going to tell you, a good spit slurp is never good in your presentation for your shitty... 
[01:08:00]  I was like, hey, fucking...  HDMI, analog buttons, who gives a fuck?  Joe, let me ask you a question real quick.  Do you have a mini HDMI cable?  Yes.  And you carry it around with you so that you can go to a friend's house and...  I keep it on my person.  I have a utility belt that's in one of the compartments on it.  Evo.  It's a fucking cool phone, man.  You talk into it, it types what you're talking when you talk into it. 
[01:08:30]  I got an app that does that.  The screen is fucking insane.  It's an amazing...  It's a 4G thing.  It's a fucking...  4G, wow.  It's a cool fucking phone.  Here's what Joe fucked up.  I'm with Sprint, so, you know...  No one would have cared if he had just went...  As people are talking about phones that people care about.  Yeah.  And you go, what kind of phone you got, Joe?  And he goes, I got the Evo.  Then people go, oh, what's that phone like?  But he goes...  Is it good?  Yeah, yeah, it's good.  Drumroll, please.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Like fucking Kong Island.  Everybody...  Oh, oh, oh.  I got the last Evo in town.  He's looking at Sam like, fuck your stupid Apple iPod.  Fuck that.  Last Evo, baby.  And no one gave a shit.  Like, it wasn't even...  Me and Sam, they had to look like...  Like...  What?  Did he just say Evo?  Is that a phone?  I didn't even know it was a phone.  Short for evolution of what?  I want you to go...  Eat a dick. 
[01:09:30]  I want you to go and look at Best Buy's new ad for them being cell phone carriers.  And right center stage of all the phones in that ad is the fucking Evo.  It's the Evo.  Not the iPhone.  But where is yours?  There's no way I'm showing it to you.  Somebody's going to throw it against the wall.  You know what?  I just got it yesterday.  You do have it?  Pull that shit out, nigga.  No one's going to smash your fucking phone.  We're adults.  Really?  We're adults.  We're not going to smash your phone.  That's just like egregious stuff.  The design is very iPhone-looking. 
[01:10:00]  Looks like an iPhone.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Okay.  Beautiful big screen.  Look at this.  Time and weather on the home screen at all times.  Uh-huh.  Updated.  And now how does that move?  Let me see.  Does that move very nicely?  I have a rotary phone.  I can do that now.  Seven screens.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Where are your apps?  Uh, these are the only apps I have right now because I just got it.  My evil apps.  Look at this.  What's that?  Full page of FriendStream.  Anything I update there goes all to my shit.  Now, you have that app on your... 
[01:10:30]  This is one of the cool features with this.  All right.  Sell me.  Sell me, bitch.  You have these apps on your iPhone.  That's what they should name these phones.  But the capability of making it a full screen that you just flip to and not having to open  the fucking app and go in and all that bullshit is awesome.  Let me tell you who these phones...  Let's just stop for a minute.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Pinch the screen.  Boom.  I'm sounding like a drug addict right now.  Like this.  You sound like a homeless man ranting.  Let me tell you what these phones are.  And I hate...  Fuck the iPhone.  And I'm going to tell you what these phones are.  They are fuck the iPhone phones. 
[01:11:00]  Like, they're made for people who want to stay underground with their technology and  go, oh, fuck this iPhone.  Like, people who don't wear Nikes.  They want the iPhone.  They're looking for better...  So they made this phone as the iPhone in case you're anti-iPhone.  Right.  But if you're anti-iPhone, you buy a BlackBerry.  Do you have a pontification about everything in life?  It's just...  It's a fucking phone.  No, but you fucked up because you didn't make it just a phone. 
[01:11:30]  You actually pulled it out and said it has the...  Actually...  You said HDMI.  You know where I fucked up?  And you have Sprint where you can't even...  Yes, Sprint.  You have to stay in New York.  I fucked up staying friends with you.  Sprint.  Sprint.  Sprint is for children.  No.  It's got better...  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  If you don't have a card...  It's got better?  If you don't have a card to put in your phone, a fucking SIM card, that's for children. 
[01:12:00]  No.  AT&T is the only people that's...  And T-Mobile, the only ones that still use SIM cards.  And they have the worst carrier maps.  Still ever.  Verizon is the best service on the planet.  Verizon doesn't have SIM cards.  AT&T covers 97% of the car.  I haven't...  AT&T stinks.  I haven't had a problem.  There you go.  Everyone's bashing AT&T.  I have not had a problem with AT&T.  But you don't leave New York a lot.  I leave New York.  I got AT&T.  My service...  Not much, though, man.  Because I'm...  You know, I'm going to the big rescue stream.  My service is highly mediocre. 
[01:12:30]  It's on a...  It's the highest level of mediocre.  Sometimes it will fuck up.  I'll tell you how often it fucks up.  As often as every other fucking service I've ever had.  I've never had a cell phone that didn't at some point fuck up.  Right.  Sprint service.  Almost zero drop calls.  I'm paying $78 a month and unlimited zero drop calls on your block.  No one's on the network.  Three people.  Why do they have 4G?  They can still have...  1G.  What's that other one that's before? 
[01:13:00]  GPRS.  And then what was the next one up?  Edge.  You still have Edge.  You still make Edge calls.  And gets great fucking reception and chat.  I don't even see Sprint commercials no more.  Their commercials now, they used to be elaborate.  They just go, hey man, we got the droid.  I'll see you later.  You want proof?  All right.  How about this?  Here's the closing of my argument in defense of this phone.  And to me, you guys should know, this is proof of how good it is.  The weather and time still on. 
[01:13:30]  Bobby fucking Kelly.  And you know what a tech geek he is.  That fucking dude yesterday goes, dude, this is hands down the best phone on the fucking market.  Oh, really?  If I was not an app button, made his official diet, fuck him.  Look who's talking.  Hands down, dude.  Fuck him too.  Look who's talking.  You threw a golden rosary around your neck this morning and started fucking...  Bobby Kelly said, dude, let me tell y'all what the thing with Evo is.  This thing is...  First of all, he said, this thing is the balls. 
[01:14:00]  This thing is the balls.  It's the balls.  It's the balls.  Oh, it's...  He has an iPhone and he ain't getting an Evo.  Yeah, he loves his iPhone.  But that's what he goes.  He goes, dude, I swear to you, if I wasn't such a fucking Apple junkie, I'd have this goddamn phone on Sprint.  What did he need from you?  Bobby's a nicer guy.  What did he need?  He needed something from you.  Bobby's very...  He wanted half of my hot dog.  He's a nicer guy.  Bobby doesn't want you not to like him.  So he'll say things.  I'm telling you, that fucking dude was going to buy...  Dude, the Star Trek, dude, it's fantastic.  He was going to buy your Evo from you? 
[01:14:30]  Stop it.  I know what you're doing and I'm letting you do it again.  Wait, he was going to buy your Evo from you?  I let this fucking cocksucker get in my head.  I let this fucking co...  Every fucking time I come in here, I let him get in my fucking shit.  It's like the day that you were sitting there going, I was going, I like this Alfred Hitchcock movie.  And you're going, Alfred Hitchcock is talentless.  He ain't shit.  Who listens to that?  Who listens to somebody say, Alfred Hitchcock ain't shit? 
[01:15:00]  And people actually was like, fuck you, you...  I go, do you really...  Do you understand there's some opinions you can't have?  One, that Bob Marley's not the best reggae guy.  Right.  Yeah.  Two, Richard Pryor's not the best comic.  Even if you don't think he is.  You just don't have an opinion.  Three, Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest suspense guy ever.  I said he sucks.  I said the birds suck.  And there's some people who are upset. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, wow.  I got hot.  We now have to take a phone call because it's Bobby Kelly, everybody.  Bobby Kelly's been listening in.  And Bobby, how you doing, man?  Shut up, man.  Shut up.  Joe DeRosa...  I'm going to start now by telling you to shut the fuck up.  Joe DeRosa started talking about his Evo phone.  And used you as the endorsement to make us all go, oh, well, Bobby Kelly said it's good.  Did you say, and I quote from Joe DeRosa, dude, that is hands down the best phone on the market. 
[01:16:00]  I didn't say hands down.  He said it's the best.  You said hands down.  I didn't say hands down.  You said hands down.  Don't make me pull the tape.  Travis, pull the tape.  He said hands down.  I've never said hands down.  Do we have it?  Travis, do we have it?  Give me one second.  All right.  We'll give Travis a second.  And I want to fucking...  This is a radio show.  It's recorded.  You can't say you didn't say something.  I can say whatever I want and assume you won't play it back. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, I will.  Oh, I'm a vindictive douche.  I will absolutely play it back.  Bobby, you did say it's the best phone on the market, though, and you said if you weren't  such an Apple junkie, you'd have it.  I said it is the best phone on the market, but if I wasn't such a...  Yes, absolutely.  But I didn't say hands down the best phone on the phone in the universe.  Now, Bob, why is it better than the iPhone?  It's not better than the iPhone.  But you just said it's the best phone on the market.  The iPhone's on the market. 
[01:17:00]  As opposed to the iPhone.  Oh, second to the iPhone.  No, he didn't say that yesterday.  He added it now.  He added it now because he's cramping up.  He's throwing me under the fucking bus because you've got him on the coals right now.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bobby, Bobby.  Let's hear the clip and hear if your quote was hands down, according to Joe DeRosa.  Wait, wait.  Time out.  It was because Joe's standing up now with his hands on his hips like fucking Perry Mason.  Get ready to defend himself. 
[01:17:30]  You are a fucker, my friend.  Fucking deuce.  Because I remember wanting to call you out on saying hands down.  So let's listen to this.  Travis, go ahead.  Here's the closing of my argument in defense of this phone.  And to me, you guys should know, this is proof of how good it is.  The weather.  Bobby fucking Kelly.  And you know what a techie key is.  Mr. High Tech.  That fucking dude yesterday goes, dude, this is hands down the best phone on the fucking market.  I rest my case.  I rest my case. 
[01:18:00]  You guys.  All right.  No further questions.  Now, did that sound like it wasn't like quote and he should have did quote and quote.  He said hands down.  Because he emphasized hands down.  Yes.  Yes.  Now, Bobby, did you say hands down the best phone on the market?  I've never used that.  I've never said my life hands down.  Unless he said my hands are down this retarded girl's panties when I was fucking 13 and we  hit her on the head with a rock.  You sick fuck. 
[01:18:30]  So what is the, Bobby, what is the Evo actually?  Yeah, Bobby, give us a little info.  The Evo is Sprint's answer to the iPhone.  It's 4G, which is around 20 times faster.  But the only thing that sucks is they only have 4G in eight states and New York isn't  one of them.  You have to go to Maryland or Baltimore if you want to use the phone.  But it has, the only thing that I really like, it has a kickstand on the back.  That's about it.  But it's pretty much a mini. 
[01:19:00]  Can we see the kickstand, please?  Can we see your fucking Evo?  This is short for evolution, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Can we see your kickstand?  Oh.  Wow.  The kickstand.  Does it have a stylus?  Bobby is lying right now.  Yesterday he said in my apartment, he goes, dude, look, don't worry about that 4G shit.  Did you hear?  They just added California.  He's fucking talking about it.  Dude, dollars to donuts, the best phone on the market. 
[01:19:30]  Dollars to donuts.  Dollars to donuts.  When you want to talk nuts and bolts, dude.  You know, dude.  In a weird way, I think Bob is setting this nigga up.  I know, because Joe feels betrayed right now.  Dude, nobody is.  They put a lot of elbow grease into this phone, dude.  Joe feels like Dan Gilbert from the Cleveland Cavaliers.  You got fucked.  Bobby just went to Miami.  It's just one guy rolling me under the bus after another. 
[01:20:00]  Get him under the fucking back tires.  So he said, hands down, Bobby.  So you didn't say, if you didn't have an iPhone, that you'd be right on this Evo.  Is that a fact?  Absolutely.  If I didn't have the iPhone.  You would change the Sprint and buy this Evo.  If I didn't have the iPhone, I would have that phone.  Because that phone is...  It's an iPhone.  It's better than the iPhone and the camera.  Certain things are better. 
[01:20:30]  But the battery life lasts, and I told you this, Joe, lasts like three minutes.  Because it's a fucking...  It's a 42-inch plasma TV.  I had no problem with the battery life yesterday.  I played with it a lot.  But let's go on record here.  And Sam fucking heard it.  He just said, it is better than the iPhone.  He just said that.  And I did not...  In certain ways.  He was back-tracked.  Okay.  He amended it after.  Joe is not going out like this.  No, no.  If this was the court system, he's already going to jail.  But luckily, this is civil court where he actually can... 
[01:21:00]  He's actually pulling...  Go ahead, Sam.  He's pulling it off.  Don't front on him.  Be honest.  He amended it after.  You made a fucking face, you cocksucker.  You saw it.  He hadn't finished his sentence yet.  But Bob Kelly said, better than the iPhone in certain ways.  You know what, Sam?  Fuck you, too.  Tammy, yes.  First of all, I'm in my trailer.  I'm filming Kirby Enthusiasm.  And I got in trouble because you fucking...  I had my thing on speakerphone listening to you, Dirtballs, talk about porn for the last 
[01:21:30]  fucking hour and a half.  That was a good conversation.  The best porn that I saw was where...  And this looked like a real movie.  Like a real...  Like, you know, like it was...  Whatever you call it.  But the guy was talking to these girls.  And they got this girl to suck this guy's cock to go into a shed.  And whatever cock comes through the door, the hole, she sucks.  Then they went to her brother and said, dude, this girl that sucks cock, all you have to  do is put your fucking cock through the hole. 
[01:22:00]  So he goes over in the woods, sticks his cock in the hole.  This chick's sucking his dick.  I've seen this.  And then she comes out at the end.  And she's like, oh my God.  And they saw each other.  It was brother and sister.  She just sucked her brother off and swallowed his load.  Was it real, though?  I just saw that.  Yeah, it seemed a little...  Yeah, it's a little odd, huh?  But the reaction was the fucking best.  And Patrice, I'm with you with the old lady.  I actually banged one in real life.  They're fucking nice.  I'm going to watch that clip. 
[01:22:30]  You're going to get in trouble talking this way in front of Larry David.  Yeah, really?  Look at you, you potty mouth.  Listen, I'm hiding down in an alley in a fucking between two buildings right now talking  to you assholes.  I'm talking to you in front of these fucking people.  I don't know I even know you guys.  Bobby, so verdict is it's a good phone if it wasn't an iPhone.  Yeah.  If you can't afford the iPhone, yeah, get it.  It's more expensive.  And, oh my God, you have a fucking middle X phone? 
[01:23:00]  This is what Bobby does.  Bobby is your best buddy when it's your Bobby.  Well, if you can't afford an iPad and an iPhone, you get that one.  It's the mixture of both.  Ah, see, there you go.  You got the fucking discount version of technology.  It's more expensive than the iPhone.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not what Bobby said.  You hold Bobby's fucking credibility at a high standard.  He said it was a fucking...  Bobby's saying anything right now.  It's for MCs.  Kicked him out of his trailer. 
[01:23:30]  It's fucking scrabbling.  He's practicing his ad-libbing.  Shut up, stupid.  He just used us to practice his fucking ad-libbing skills for fucking Larry David.  He called up to practice a fake argument like he's going to have on the show.  We're going to see Curb next month, and it's going to be Larry David going,  I kind of like the Evo.  It stinks.  Dude, I got an idea.  It's a phone discussion between the Evo and the iPhone.  It's very topical. 
[01:24:00]  Well, let's go with that.  Let's go with that.  I'm full of shit, Bobby.  You know he's a fucking...  He's fucking had an agenda, you piece of shit.  You didn't care about the Evo.  Practicing his fucking improv skills.  Oh, my God.  You know what I want to do.  Bobby, thank you so much for helping that out.  Hey, Larry.  What's up, Larry?  How you doing, buddy?  Oh, look at these two.  That's my pals.  He's talking to Larry Reeb.  Watch this. 
[01:24:30]  Line one, Tony in New York.  Watch, watch.  Hey, we're going to take some calls.  Hey, Tony.  Yes, sir.  How you doing, man?  What do you got for the show?  I just wanted to back up, Joe.  I'm going to be one minute.  I'm just going to say I got the Evo.  I got the iPhone.  I'm happy with the Evo.  I don't hate the iPhone.  I just think the Evo is a pretty damn good phone.  It's, you know, the only thing I can say about the Evo right now that hasn't caught up with the iPhone is the apps. 
[01:25:00]  I think the apps, which we discussed already.  See how this goes?  Joe Pax opened his phone.  Did you fucking hate the callers?  And nothing.  Well, Tony.  Nothing, Tony, you sacrificial lamb.  Tony.  Tony made it a damn fine point.  I like when he said that.  That was a damn fine point.  Tony, I used to have the iPhone.  I got rid of it and got this.  Because you couldn't afford the iPhone.  We already established.  And you did brag about your $78 a month bill.  It's fucking better service for less money. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, you're a fucking discount guy.  You're a discount guy.  Less money, less gooder.  And you had discount Tony coming back you up.  Discount Tony.  Discount Joe and Tony.  That's your new shit.  I love the reiteration call.  The reiteration call.  Yeah, you know, I just want to add that, you know, Joe, it is a good phone.  It's great.  The Evo.  I'm better than the iPhone.  You get the weather.  You squeeze your fingers and the screens come up. 
[01:26:00]  The camera.  I just wanted to reiterate everything Joe said because I have nothing to add to the show.  Fucking, I'm a dumb caller.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you.  I hate you.  Let me tell you how fucking fucked up this is.  It's tearing down everything Opie built for 20 years.  And when he gets back, no fucking Johnny from Schenectady is going to be on the fucking phone because he's not going to get there.  Fuck him. 
[01:26:30]  Fuck him.  All right.  Let me hear Andrew.  Andrew from Illinois, everybody.  Live by.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  Let's go.  Andrew from Illinois.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got for the show today, Andrew?  Motherfucker.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Andrew from Illinois is going a little bit better than that Tony guy did.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  So the Evo over the iPhone has got an 8 megapixel camera, which should be a little bit better than the iPhone 6 megapixel. 
[01:27:00]  So that's a big one.  Yeah, yeah.  2 megapixel.  That's Flash.  Also is getting the Android 2.2 software this week, which is going to have Flash players installed.  So all the Flash websites that he should go to, that the iPhone will never be able to play, all the Android phones will be able to play.  Let me go to the hands are up here in the studio.  Patrice O'Neill.  I'm listening to Tech Talk.  I like tech stuff.  Of course.  I'm not deep into it like you guys.  I love hearing it.  It seems to me somehow the iPhone has figured out something. 
[01:27:30]  Right.  There's something about it that is fantastic.  But the drawer, it's like there's, what he's saying is little things just to be better than the iPhone.  But it ain't, it's like saying, okay, I got a Mercedes, it's a V6.  Well, the new, the new fucking Infiniti is a V12.  And you go, I'm still buying this Mercedes, even though, yeah, this one has 27 spark plugs, but the Mercedes only has 23. 
[01:28:00]  Like the flash, it just doesn't seem like, it's like carrying around a television with flash.  It sounds like, it's just.  It's like this.  You got a picture like this.  The iPhone is an amazing device.  Thanks, Andrew.  And I just dump them.  The iPhone's an amazing device.  It's concise.  It's user-friendly.  It's a fantastic phone.  Its downfall is AT&T service.  It's like having a Mac. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, but Verizon's going to get it soon.  It's like having a Mac.  No, they're not, dude.  That's been the rumor since it came out.  It's like having a Mac computer that you can only use dial-up internet with.  Oh, don't even make that analogy.  Sure, I made it.  Joe DeRosa.  Let me ask you, when was the last time you made an AT&T call on a fucking iPhone?  A few months ago when I still had my iPhone.  And what happened?  The fucking thing dropped constantly.  They're probably.  You hold on to it tighter.  They're probably, exactly.  The problem in New York City is they have tons of towers, but their signal strength has 
[01:29:00]  a problem getting, I don't know what the term is, but getting through the buildings.  Buildings.  It's not that there aren't enough towers in New York.  It's the buildings.  I use my fucking phone.  I got AT&T.  I use it in the tunnels.  Yeah, but you.  I use it in the tunnel.  Look at all my bars.  I'm telling you, dude, I live three blocks from here, I fucking drop calls constantly.  Here's what I hate about that fucking stupid phone.  The web service stinks.  It just stinks. 
[01:29:30]  Web service stinks.  AT&T stinks.  As a performer, some people want to take pictures.  Do you know how fast my 3G is?  That doesn't have a flash.  Yeah.  It does now.  No, it does.  Oh, well finally, after the fourth generation.  You need to buy another phone?  Exactly.  I'm not going to say they don't have that built-in obsolescence, because they do that all  the time.  They fucking make something, and then the next version has something you wanted on  the other version.  And now the new shit has a...  Yeah, now it's got a flash on it.  You know, I might be soft.  I still think BlackBerrys is for the big boys. 
[01:30:00]  I think that shit is big boys.  BlackBerrys.  You got FaceTime on that thing?  Big boy fucking...  You got FaceTime.  You know, business.  I'll give you this.  The problem with my FaceTime versus yours is nobody's got this phone unless people  have Sprint, so the FaceTime is...  I could just FaceTime my ass off on this thing.  I'll go 3G to 3G with you right now, and the 3G service on Sprint is insane, dude.  It's fast.  I'm not in that big a hurry for fucking just getting to, you know, oh, here we go.  I want to check, you know, my stock or something. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, so you can't even use the 4G.  It has 4G capability.  You can use...  They don't have it in New York yet.  But they don't have 4G.  They will.  I mean, it'll just be a matter of time.  They will.  They will.  But the smart thing is to go back and use Edge, because nobody uses Edge anymore.  Yeah, let's get back on Edge.  Well, AT&T, by the way, is ripping down all their Edge towers.  Edge service will be eliminated, which means your fucking phone battery is going to die like  that, because the iPhone, when you have it on 3G, the battery runs out instantly. 
[01:31:00]  Instantly.  Mine's on 3G all the time.  All fucking day.  It goes to Edge.  You're mad when it goes to Edge.  I go to my network when I go home, and this thing doesn't...  Where are you getting your info?  I had...  You're a hater.  Edge was a tech liar.  From the first gen.  I didn't get that one, so maybe it's better with that one.  You didn't get this one.  He's talking about the latest version that is the best version, and you're bad-mouthing  it like the last version.  He fucking knows that he made a mistake with this Evo. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, I know.  He bought...  How long did you have to wait online for your Evo, by the way?  He bought the hybrids of phones.  How long are you waiting online for your Evo?  They just had one at the store, and I bought it.  Yeah, of course they did.  You know, the people waited 8, 10 hours to pick up a fucking iPhone.  I bet the instructions wasn't this.  He bought it from an Arab.  I won't say they're not morons.  I'll just say, you know, know a guy at the store, dummy.  I had a fucking conniption fit yesterday, because the iPhone 4 is still sold out everywhere.  I was going to leave Sprint yesterday.  So he won it. 
[01:32:00]  That's why he got an Evo, by the way.  Can I please say, it now, it now, it goes all the fucking...  Don't get frustrated.  It goes all the way back to where I said, these phones are nothing but vengeance against the  iPhone.  You don't even know what I was going to say.  I wasn't going to say I was going to go back to the iPhone.  That's not what I was going to say.  He went shopping for a fucking, the 4G iPhone.  So he said, fuck that, I'm going to get the Evo.  That's what he did. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, you're sold out?  What's the next best phone?  I didn't...  For cheapskates.  What's the second best phone?  Forget it.  I can't...  Why do I keep trying to defend it?  I don't understand.  Because you brought up that phone like it was the second coming of Christ.  You sold it.  You brought it up with such power.  I went looking, I was going to switch to Verizon yesterday because I was pissed off that the  Evo was sold out everywhere.  And then I go to Verizon and then look at all the new Droid phones and they're all sold  out everywhere. 
[01:33:00]  And then the fucking iPhone 4 I know is also sold out everywhere.  So you got your phone because everything you wanted was gone?  No, no, no.  I wanted this phone the most, but I couldn't fucking find it.  I found one, but I couldn't find it.  And I was ready to go, fuck this.  I'm just going to go to Verizon.  I was so mad that it was sold out that I was going to go to Verizon and get their new  Droid.  Then they were all sold out.  And then I remembered that AT&T is all sold out of fucking iPhones.  Let me ask you a question.  Why did you get your fucking iPhone?  My iPhone?  Because I had the previous generations. 
[01:33:30]  I like the iPhone.  I like the interface.  You just wanted that iPhone.  I wanted this phone.  Did you hear this horse shit that he went downtown and then he found out and then the  sky turned green?  I didn't get an iPhone because my first three picks were sold out.  I have a BlackBerry.  That's not what I said.  You know what?  My BlackBerry fucking bowl.  It's what you said now.  I have a BlackBerry bowl.  And they changed the fucking trackball into this optical pad. 
[01:34:00]  And that's all I needed.  Does that work?  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  Because I'm not a big fan of touchscreen shit.  I know that's the new, that's the shit, but I like, it seems it can go wrong too much.  I like that touch screen.  And your greasy fingers and shit just be on your screen.  Yeah, you just do this.  You go, meh, meh, on your shirt.  By the way, the guy you're saddling up with has a fucking BlackBerry and not even the touch  screen BlackBerry.  The shitty, oh, damn, we should be at war.  The shitty old fucking BlackBerry where you can't even dial a phone number when it says 
[01:34:30]  dial 1-800-OPI-N-ANTHONY because the fucking keypad doesn't have the goddamn headers on it.  When I have, when I have, when I go places on first class, when I fly, I know a lot of people fly coach that have Evos, they have Evo coach.  So, I like that, you only fly first class because you're too fat to sit and coach.  Oh, it degenerates to this. 
[01:35:00]  But when me and my first class white people, the ones that aren't fat, everyone pulls out  a BlackBerry.  Everybody.  Because it's business.  It's the business.  It's a business phone.  But look it, iPods, I touch, they're for kids.  They're cute.  Well, I now have to, I now have to retort.  Allow me to retort.  Your old good buddy Patrice just turned on you.  Fuck iPhones. 
[01:35:30]  I've always hated iPhones, but I'm saying, I know I hate the Evo.  Yeah, I hate the Evo too.  Fuck, I hate the iPhone, but fuck the Evo.  I hate the Evo.  Fuck that stupid phone.  Can I just say really quickly to the ass that just feedbacked in, Drew Chutrain.  Ooh.  Uh, Android, he just writes, Android 27% of the market versus 23% iPhone.  Shut up!  Now, I'm so sick of hearing this, I'm so sick of hearing this argument, because what people  don't seem to understand is that it's, we're talking about an Android, which is an OS, it's 
[01:36:00]  an operating system, which runs on fucking 50 different phones versus the iPhone, which  is only on the iPhone.  So all those phones combined are selling more than the one.  Well, I should hope that 50 different Android phones are beating solitary iPhone sales.  What I want to see for the Android is buy one, get 12 free.  That's it.  It's another phone for kids. 
[01:36:30]  Dude, do you know how much BlackBerrys cost when you sign up to Sprint or Verizon or AT&T?  Anyway, a dollar?  $25.  That's a shit.  $25, even with your instant.  They all can suck my dick, really.  I wish I could fuck, I wish I had a pigeon.  I'll go back to them, carry a pigeon, nigga, or fucking, a guy that can get his head cut  off when I send them to go fucking tell somebody bad news.  Well, I know, the thing about the BlackBerry is it is a business thing, but that's like  saying Windows, a lot of businesses are still running Windows, they don't have Macs running 
[01:37:00]  all over, unless they're like an art house does, you know, photographic places, they have  a lot of Macs, but that's what it is.  It doesn't mean it's better, it just means it's more conducive to business.  But here's the only reason why, and this is where your argument is completely flawed,  it's more...  Joe hates me, I don't know what's wrong.  Oh, man.  Joe for the fucking prosecution today.  Ever since I said Alfred Hitchcock stunk, I don't even remember doing that, only fucking  who listens to that.  Steven Spielberg's a douche. 
[01:37:30]  Jaws was a rip-off of fucking Piranha.  Like, what the fucking...  What's your point about the BlackBerry?  It's only better for business because of the way that it's able to be networked in.  Yes.  You know, if you have a massive amount of employees and you need them all on the same network,  that's why it's better for business.  And you don't want to fucking around with fun games and stuff.  Yeah, well...  Let me tell you, the first iPhone...  As an individual, it makes absolutely no difference.  The first iPhone couldn't...  You couldn't have 75 email addresses that consolidate into one thing. 
[01:38:00]  Now, they had to build...  BlackBerry hasn't changed that since it began.  It hasn't changed much.  It's a fucking great phone.  I love BlackBerry.  I had the first generation BlackBerry.  Those things have fucking changed drastically.  My girl loves the iPod.  Got her...  I mean, the iPhone.  I bought her the iPhone.  She loves it.  Hey, you're using that as an insult.  She twitters with it. 
[01:38:30]  I like Twitter with mine.  She's cute.  It's just...  It's cute.  Yeah, it's cute.  It's fun.  You're a fun guy.  Did you guys...  There's a bunch of kids, dog.  Did you guys know...  You're a millionaire with your toys, man.  You love them.  Did you know the first car ever could only fit two people in it?  Did you know that?  They had to build up with the first airplane ever.  No.  Oh, wow.  They could fit.  That fucking argument sucked.  Droid...  What is it?  What's his stupid phone?  Evo.  He's not...  He knows he's fucked up.  He's gonna try to get his money back today. 
[01:39:00]  He fucking knows he fucked up.  There's only two conversations...  And look, I wouldn't even...  I'm not...  There's only two conversations.  The iPhone or the BlackBerry.  It really is.  And the iPhone will probably defeat the BlackBerry in the car.  Eventually.  But I know that I fucking...  My life was better because of BlackBerry.  Just because you answer emails, they come back and they look...  See, that's it.  I feel my life is better because of the iPhone.  You like the iPhone.  That's what I'm saying.  It's iPhone BlackBerry.  Everything else, though, is all the same shit. 
[01:39:30]  Everybody's in there like...  That's lumped in.  People are going...  Everybody's going, BlackBerry.  See BlackBerry.  iPhone.  iPhone, BlackBerry.  I bought the last Evo and all the other shit.  I want to thank you guys for having me on the cunt and cunt show today.  You shitty phone that gets HDMI.  Who the fuck...  I can't even watch a whole movie.  HDMI sucks up the energy.  The movie sucks up the energy. 
[01:40:00]  What the fuck is...  Who's plugging that phone into the TV?  Dude, I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I watched the TV.  I had to have Bobby explain that to me yesterday.  He goes...  He goes...  Hands down.  You watch shit on the TV.  And he did say hands down at cops.  He did say hands down.  He goes, dude, it's got fucking HDMI.  I go, what is that even...  Why would you want to...  I literally go, why would you want to plug your phone into the TV?  I don't understand it.  I pay no attention to Bobby's fucking technology. 
[01:40:30]  Because you know what it is?  I'm going to tell you something.  You know what Bobby's technology shit is?  And this is why I pay him no attention.  He wants that.  Bobby is the tech guy.  He wants to own that.  And I don't want to take it from him.  But I don't pay any attention.  It's just like Philadelphia wants to be cheesesteak place.  Right.  They want it.  I've been to six places that have better sandwiches.  Oh my God.  But you want it?  You can fucking...  You own it.  Have it.  And Bobby...  Bobby's tech thing like, dude, let me tell you. 
[01:41:00]  And then you go, well, I'm not the tech guy.  I don't really want to be.  So, yeah, tell me, Bobby.  You be the guy.  Well, you know what?  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, that's good.  HDMI.  Holy shit.  Dude.  Let me tell you, dude.  One of the funniest things ever was him explaining the iPad to me.  Yeah.  And I go, I don't understand, Bobby.  It's just like a laptop.  And he goes, no, dude.  It's fucking not.  Okay?  Because if I'm in a fucking airport, I got a laptop. 
[01:41:30]  I got to sit there and do this.  And he literally starts miming doing a mouse with his finger.  Yeah, he does a very good mime.  And acts like, dude, he's got this expression on his face.  Like, it's like draining his fucking living essence.  Like an infomercial showing how hard it is to use an ordinary towel.  And then he goes, dude, I swear...  Yeah, exactly.  And then I swear to God, he goes, he goes, but if I got the iPad, dude, I pull it out.  I can flap this.  I can flip this.  When he started talking about flapping pages, I want to hit him with it.  And he goes, he goes, it's got a virtual keyboard on it, which is fucking great. 
[01:42:00]  Check this out, dude.  He's got the new keyboard where he wraps something around all his fingers.  Yeah.  And he fucking...  Yeah.  It's like fucking...  I'm in the airport.  Minority Report.  Minority Report.  He's got to put on that, I'm playing King Kong suit in a movie.  He fucking wants it.  I know the fucking...  Wait a minute.  This is the Andy Serkis suit.  He's got the fucking...  The Gollum suit.  It's attached to his face and...  He's got the ping pong balls all over him for fucking motion capture. 
[01:42:30]  Bobby got a green screen in his eyes.  I'm not a motion capture myself.  Douche.  I got the eye suit, dude.  It's fucking sick.  Fucking...  But he wants it.  He wants it.  He gets out the letters and it types it, dude.  He fucking...  So, dude, he's telling me about the fucking iPad.  And then I swear to God, he goes, he goes, he goes, and dude, if you don't like...  If you don't like the virtual keyboard, check this out.  You can buy an external keyboard and plug it in.  And I go, so it's a fucking laptop, you dickhead. 
[01:43:00]  You fight the same fucking thing.  It's funny how he just turned on Bob, too, because Bob turned on him.  They were friends.  Oh, they were...  He legitimized Bobby.  He was using Bob to back his story up.  No.  No?  What?  Bob?  I was going to ask if I can use that.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Oh.  Dude, yeah, yeah, it's always good for a phone.  Dude, is it working?  Dude, I heard you fucking turn on me on Opie and Anthony today, dude.  The fucking iPad is not the same thing as a laptop.  Right, dude? 
[01:43:30]  Wait a minute, wait.  Can you please...  Wait, can you please add some doobob?  Please blow cigarette smoke also.  You have to go...  Because that's his fucking poignant thinking is a cigarette smoke Bobby.  Dude, dude, look.  I heard you on the show.  Let me...  That's some dude, like, when he's in here, it's like, dude, let me tell you something.  He gets on the phone, it's like, dude.  Oh, dude.  Dude.  This is me. 
[01:44:00]  This is you calling Bobby after he does your show.  Ready?  Hello.  Oh, what's up, dude?  I'm just fucking cooked.  I got it.  Dude, bird me, we're trashing Bobby.  We go, Bobby's so fat.  Even when he talks about his physical state, it's in cooking terms.  I'm just fried, dude.  Fried.  Ugh.  I'm cooked.  I'm just basted after this morning, bro.  Cigarettes, baked.  And a sip of coffee, and then he's talking about fucking technology.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:44:30]  But he, again, he wants it.  He wants it.  A lot of these places want what they want.  Like I said, I'm not going to lie.  I've tasted two or three places that Philly steaks, I just, I go, whatever.  Patrice, that is so wrong.  But they want it.  So I have nothing to say.  They've got to be the Philly cheesesteak.  It's Philly.  It's in the name.  Why would you take something from somebody that wants?  They want it.  They're the best at it.  That's why.  Deep dish pizza, you go to Chicago. 
[01:45:00]  Let me tell you something.  I bet I get better at deep dish.  Chicago deep dish pizza sucks dick.  Welcome back to Difficult for No Reason with Patrice O'Neill.  I'm not falling for the banana in the tailpipe.  I had it.  I ordered it when I was there.  I ordered a whole deep dish and I ordered the other one they're proud of, which is thin crust. 
[01:45:30]  First of all, they cut them in squares.  That's the first thing I put my balls in.  The second thing is a deep dish pizza is cheese on the bottom.  Yeah.  And then it's like eating a fucking rim.  It's hard.  It's not delicious.  New York pizza.  And I'm not from New York, is the best pizza I've ever had.  I don't think anyone is going to argue that point. 
[01:46:00]  But Chicago wants to own the deep dish pizza.  They want pizza?  They have it, Chicago.  They want deep dish.  I'm not going to say your fucking Texas doesn't have the best barbecue I've ever had.  I went to Texas.  Can I have some of that Texas brisket?  Oh, shit.  I thought I cut a piece of my own ass off and didn't cook it.  I ate a raw piece of my own ass.  And they look at you with this, how's that, huh, partner?  And you can't go, it eats balls because they want it. 
[01:46:30]  They want brisket.  You can fucking have it, Texas, but you don't have the best fucking nap.  Brisket, really?  Did you wrap it up and marinate it and dry rub?  It's stunk.  Brisket doesn't like anything.  But they want it.  Yes, they do want to be the barbecue steak.  The only place that owns something that is actually, I'm going to, is, and I order clam chowder anywhere I fucking go. 
[01:47:00]  New England clam chowder.  But Boston has, there's a place called fucking Kelly's Rose Beef in, like, Revere.  It's the best clam chowder you can have.  He just.  Bob Kelly's back on life.  He's very busy, but he's fitting this in his busy schedule.  Crank him up a little bit.  Yeah, Bobby, what's up, man? 
[01:47:30]  I'm hiding in a stairwell right now.  I'm not talking to you, asshole.  First of all, I don't like that you're doing me.  You sound just like me on the radio.  He does do a good Bobby.  You do a great subdued Bobby, by the way.  Very good Bobby, subdued Bobby.  I didn't know I was good at that until I did it to Colin one day, and we were laughing.  He goes, oh, I know, I know, that's fucking him.  That's fucking him.  The only thing he misses is the coffee sip and the cigarettes of his fucking short paws of poignance. 
[01:48:00]  You fucking dick.  His poignancy paws.  Bobby, would you like to respond to that?  Listen, this show is just a bunch of fucking friends throwing each other on the roof.  You guys are, how the fuck did it turn on me?  You're not even here.  I know.  I'm not even here.  Listen, Joe, I think your phone is great. 
[01:48:30]  For you and what you wanted, it's great.  That's all I was trying to say yesterday.  I was trying not to be a dick to you.  So, see your phone, if you want to make phone calls, it's great.  I apologize, Joe, if you are getting all whipped up, all right, over your fucking dumb plasma fucking TV.  Dude.  The reason why I didn't get the phone is because I don't need to hook it up to my TV.  But I said that's exactly right for you.  Listen, dude. 
[01:49:00]  Yep.  I know you were just being fucking cold, dude.  You know?  I mean, we come on the fucking show, dude.  You know, I'm just fucking cold.  This is a scene in a show, by the way.  Is this Bobby Seen coming up?  Are you subdued Bobby in the show today, Bob?  Yeah, which Bobby are you? 
[01:49:30]  Listen to me, you fucking cunt.  You fucking cunt.  I'm fucking, I gotta walk down the street.  Hang on, you motherfuckers.  Yeah, I'm smoking.  Dude, kill it today on fucking Curb, dude.  It's gonna do good things for both of us.  Cigarette.  Look at his stupid cigarette balls, you asshole.  Bobby reflects what he just said. 
[01:50:00]  Adds a little more.  Yeah.  Goddamn, Bobby.  Listen to me.  I fucking, you cunt, you cunt, suck it, Joe.  I fucking, I, and Patrice,  the reason why I fucking have tech  is because I have nothing else in my life.  So you can have it.  Exactly.  It's the reason why Texas has brisket.  They want brisket.  Anthony, you love your iPad.  You told me you love it.  Oh, I do.  I never say anything about that.  But Anthony, you know what Anthony doesn't do, Bobby? 
[01:50:30]  What?  He doesn't claim tech.  He just goes, oh, I'm gonna buy it.  But he really doesn't go, oh.  He just gets what he gets.  I got it because I like it.  We have to listen to your tech knowledge.  You like, you like being the tech guy.  But I love that you love it.  I have nothing else.  But that's what I'm saying.  I want to give you tech.  He owns it.  He owns it.  You want it and you can have it.  Yeah.  We love you.  Take tech.  I got it.  All right.  Well, thank you very much. 
[01:51:00]  I'll take tech.  Thank you very much.  So right now, I'm the tech guy on the show.  Any tech things, I got it, right?  Yes, you are.  Yes.  Even though Danny's a tech guy too, but you only hear Danny's techs when he's mad as hell  at somebody else's tech bullshit.  So he's just like, oh.  Satellites are stupid.  Like, Danny gets mad as soon as a fucking guy.  I don't like fucking shitty arguments.  That's all.  It's just like, if you're going to say something stupid, I'm going to have to fucking... 
[01:51:30]  I'm going to have to call you.  Danny also proves it by like, he can, if you have a problem with your computer or a network  or something, like Danny can fucking hardware and software fix shit.  He's a tech guy.  Like, that's a tech guy.  But he doesn't claim tech.  No, no.  Bobby claims it.  Bobby makes you want to...  Makes...  Forces you to...  Bobby...  Here's one thing he just stopped trying to force me to do.  Is get online on Xbox.  I'm like...  He goes, dude, you gotta get...  I go, I don't want to play with these people. 
[01:52:00]  I don't want them to play...  I don't want to play...  I want to do the story mode.  When that's done, I'm done with the fucking game.  I finish the game.  I don't want to be here with some fucking kid that's bothering me.  But he was trying to get me to get online.  I couldn't do it.  I hate doing it.  It's a whole nother part of the game, dude.  Dude.  Dude.  What's up, dude?  You online right now?  Dude.  Dude, can you hear me through your fucking headset, dude? 
[01:52:30]  All right, listen.  Go into this fucking room.  It's called Call of Duty Black Ops.  Go in.  Okay?  You see that name on the screen?  Dumbshit Dickwad.  That's my gamer name.  Okay?  Go on there.  Hold on, dude.  Fucking sign into my group.  All right.  Bobby knows that's him, too.  But, Bobby, don't stop being a tech guy. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, because, man, we love that you're the tech guy.  No, I buy shit because Bobby has it.  Dude, Bobby's the tech guy.  Like, he comes in with something, and I go, fuck, that's cool.  I got to get that.  Yeah, no, that's why I used him in my defense argument.  Dude, I bought this fucking app.  But it didn't work.  I know.  You threw in hands down.  Dude.  It fucked up your testimony.  Because it's like arguing with you guys is like arguing, like, with gorillas.  You just jump on your chest and start pounding it.  It's like, well, what the fuck?  The logic isn't going to kick in here at any point.  I got a little bit of directors right now. 
[01:53:30]  Go do your show, my friend.  All right.  See you, Bobby.  I'll take one more call before we take a break.  Obviously, Bill from Ohio has got something just so important for the show.  Bill.  Bill from Ohio.  You're on, Bill.  You're full of shit.  Oh.  This pizza is so much better than New York.  Oh, now we're going to do it.  Is he from Chicago?  Pizza.  Okay, ready?  I only want to make this argument with people who aren't from that area. 
[01:54:00]  Look, I'm from Boston.  I think Boston has some good food.  It's, but I'm not going to say.  He's from Ohio, this guy.  Okay.  He's saying Chicago pizza is better than New York.  Okay.  I was born in Chicago and I lived in New York.  Don't defend it because it's from there.  Have you ever had a nice big slice of fucking, like, La Familia pizza fresh out the oven? 
[01:54:30]  Have you?  I lived in Syracuse and Liverpool.  Syracuse, no.  We're not talking.  When people say New York, they mean Manhattan.  You dumb motherfucker.  See?  See?  See?  When people say California, they mean L.A.  They don't mean fucking Sacramento.  They're cities.  Listen.  Right.  Chicago, listen, I'm saying, if you want, if you want it, you can have it. 
[01:55:00]  If somebody goes, oh, I got the best beef hot dog, what the fuck ever?  Chicago has better hot dogs, too.  That's what I'm like.  Yeah, because they have better beef.  Oh, fuck you.  I'm so fucking tired that Chicago, Chicago hot dogs are great because we put fucking pickle juice  and hot peppers and mayonnaise on it.  Oh, that whole hot dog thing where they're laying hot dogs.  Chicken hot dogs are terrible.  Dude, guess what?  You're a faggot.  That's another useless call.  Goodbye. 
[01:55:30]  Goodbye.  People get, they really get protective of their local fare, but it's like I've had, I'm saying  this because I've had a Philly cheesesteak.  Right.  I'm not going to go fuck it and fuck Philly cheesesteak.  I'm saying I have had some cheesesteaks that I was like, this is better.  And the only reason is the same thing of why when he brought up Evo, it's the attitude  of why you say you, they, Philly goes. 
[01:56:00]  Fucking Philly cheesesteaks.  Yeah.  If they could just go, hey, have one of my cheesesteaks, taste this.  And you go, wow, that's pretty good.  That's really up there with some of the best cheesesteaks.  But the fact is, we want cheesesteaks.  We're known for it.  We rule.  We have the best.  Boston has, we call them steak and cheeses.  Boston steak and cheese is phenomenal.  But now you're breaking the rule because you're from the area.  I'm only saying that, I'm only saying that because I, I, luckily I have traveled and 
[01:56:30]  I'm eat.  Yeah.  San Francisco has the best Chinese homos and best Chinese food.  Chinese food.  Yeah.  San Francisco's Chinese food is phenomenal.  That makes sense.  They've been coming over for years.  Phenomenal.  Right.  Better than any Chinese food.  New York Chinese food stinks.  Dude, let me tell you something.  There's a Chinatown down here in Arkansas and it's the best goddamn Chinese food you're 
[01:57:00]  ever going to eat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would get a caller like that.  I'm so mad at that brisket in Houston.  It's just like, go down to the little place where it's rickety and, uh, you know, there's  an actual cowboy.  He's about 106, still has a horse.  Come on down.  Here's how we cook it.  They, they even put on the menu how it's cooked.  Yeah.  Slow cook with the bottle.  I went in there, dude.  If, if I didn't have my, I had to buy eight gallons of iced tea to enjoy this fucking brisket. 
[01:57:30]  To wash this down with.  And to wash down this dry, this brisket, to wash down this tasted brisket.  That is a dry brisket.  But here's, but here's, here's what a polite motherfucker I am.  I said, you, these guys believe in this brisket.  Yeah.  I said, maybe my taste buds.  I'm wrong.  I'm going to eat this fucking brisket.  Yeah.  I'm going to, this is, this stinks.  Dude. 
[01:58:00]  But I kept going because you wanted it.  It's like the Mexican.  Samuel Jackson eating that burger.  This tasty brisket.  May I have some of your Texas tea to wash down this tasty brisket.  That's that, that's that Houston Bobby Q.  Six gallons iced tea.  May I drink the six gallons of iced tea to wash down this shithole brisket.  Because my woman enjoys ribs.  Which means I enjoy ribs, too, by the way. 
[01:58:30]  I don't dig on brisket.  Don't get mad at your stupid food.  I've been around, and I'm just saying, dude, it's just, there's, there's places that.  Things people take pride in make me laugh a lot of times.  It really does.  It's, it's so ridiculous.  Why are you so like, dude, a pizza, so much better.  First of all, it's taste, it's subjective to a point, unless it's shit and filet mignon.  Yeah.  I bet the filet mignon tastes better than the shit. 
[01:59:00]  But like, if this guy likes Chicago pizza better than New York pizza, or Syracuse pizza, by the way.  The guy calls with his point that New York pizza sucks, based on Syracuse pizza.  No one has fucking Liverpool, he said.  Yeah, Liverpool.  No.  Where the fuck is Liverpool?  I don't know.  He ate Canadian pizza.  Nobody uses the entire state as a restaurant.  When you say New York, you mean the city of New York.  And I have something else to say, if there's listeners in Chicago.  When you say LA, you don't mean Bakersfield.  Anybody out there, anybody out there in Chicago, you have a great city, but number one, when 
[01:59:30]  it comes to your deep dish pizza, Pizza Hut is better.  Number one.  Number two, fuck your hot dogs.  I can't stress.  I'm tired of that shit.  Oh, man.  Fucking Chicago.  Oh, you're standing on line for a half hour just to get the pickles and the fucking cabbage.  Do you have a fucking strawberry dog?  They put fucking strawberries on them.  Shut up.  It's disgusting.  Give me a bun and mustard and I'm out of here.  I went to Cincinnati and a motherfucker made me have their local spaghetti and chili. 
[02:00:00]  I took two bites and he's just looking at me with his eyes really open.  It was a limo driver, one of the drivers.  He goes, I go, what's the thing you eat here?  He's like, oh, chili and spaghetti.  We go to Chili and Spaghetti R Us and I almost mash it in his face like a Three Stooges.  It doesn't even sound good.  That sounds nasty.  Fucking, it's like, but he was, he was so proud that this is something he could go, this 
[02:00:30]  is what we do.  And he's going to turn you on to part of their culture.  And my mind was open, man.  I'm a greedy, my mind is open to any food you want to give me a chance to taste.  And dude, deep dish Chicago pizza, I have to say, one of the most overrated, like Philly  cheesesteaks aren't like, I don't get mad at them.  No, no.  I just, I get mad at deep dish pizza. 
[02:01:00]  I just get mad.  I get mad at deep dish pizza because it's just, wet tomatoes just thrown on top.  It's a reverse, it's a reverse regular pizza.  I would take cold pizza, hot pizza with no cheese on it.  Over Chicago cheese.  That overnight, the dog ate it all during a party.  You woke up and just ate the crust.  It's just that layer of sauce that looks like it was dripped on there by accident.  Pizza doesn't even look like they put it on purpose. 
[02:01:30]  Who enjoys Uno's?  Oh, it sticks.  Who the fuck goes to Uno's to have Chicago-style pizza?  When you get there, you order chicken fingers.  Or if you are a personal, the giant cooked, really, is my pepperoni on the sauce?  I don't even know how to fucking eat this shit.  Look at that thing.  Danny just punched up a picture.  It's horrible.  It looks disgusting. 
[02:02:00]  The crust is hard.  Hey, you know how you...  The crust is fucking, like, tooth-breaking hard.  You know how your least favorite part of the pizza is the crust?  And your second least favorite part is the sauce?  Yeah.  Fucking everybody's food.  Wait a second.  If you eat actual Chinese food, you might die.  That's a promo for the next episode of his show.  Patrice, what do you think of Disney World? 
[02:02:30]  Fuck Mickey Mouse!  I'm sick of it!  And by the way, the Italian food in the Italy in Epcot was fantastic.  So I don't even have to go to Italy.  Real quick, though, before we get too far away from Chicago, remember when McDonald's had pizza?  No.  They had pizza for a month in 1996.  And lobster sandwiches.  I would rather have the McDonald's pizza.  He would rather have McDonald's pizza.  Over Chicago deep fish.  Mama Celeste, I would take over Chicago deep fish. 
[02:03:00]  I would rather have Elio's from school.  I'd rather have Elio's.  Is there some kind of commercial that you have to do?  Have we been on two hours straight talking about fucking pizza and phones?  I would take Elio's that Mama Celeste uses a tampon over Chicago deep dish pizza.  Throw it in her fucking old panties.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  You're right.  I'm just looking, laughing, fucking talking about phones and shitty Chicago food.  Almost 6.45 to 8.30 talking about how shitty your brisket is. 
[02:03:30]  Ah, shit.  Well, at 9.15, wow, Forrest Griffin is coming in.  Yeah.  Jimmy's very excited, but he's not here.  So we're going to sit and talk about his new book.  Oh, can I say that I'm in, uh...  Yeah, plugs.  I'm in Charlie Good Nights this weekend, which is in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Raleigh.  Thursday through Saturday. 
[02:04:00]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Pussy Patrice.  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday at Charlie Good Nights in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Very funny.  Uh, Joe?  I just wrote, can I, my album's out.  My Comedy Central album is finally out.  It's on, uh, iTunes and Amazon and stuff.  Please buy it.  It's called the Depression Auction.  Please buy it.  Thank you.  Can I plug something?  Oh, Kenny wants to plug something.  Yeah, I'll be at the Tampa Improv this weekend, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Say hello to me while Jim Norton's on stage.  Oh, you're flying over to take Jimmy at the Tampa Improv? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  It's a nice club, too, by the way.  Yeah, it is.  It's a fun club.  I think I did go to that one once.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, uh, back in a flash.  Uh, stick around.  For people of the real attention, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show on the Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hi, Sam.  Hi.  Yeah, Sam, Danny, T-Storm, Patrice, and Joe DeRosa hanging out with me, Anthony. 
[02:05:00]  Where'd you go?  I went to have a cigarette really quick.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you did.  Kind of get that waft, a little bit of cigarette waft.  You don't smell that much anymore.  Like, you don't smell, uh, people stinking of cigarettes anymore.  No one can smoke anywhere.  I know, because you can't really smoke anywhere.  The only person, I didn't have any, I had to bum one, and the only person that had one  was a guy that rolls his own.  He's like, I'll roll you one.  And I'm like, thank you.  Can I do the lick part, please? 
[02:05:30]  Would you smoke outside?  Yeah.  He was like, yeah, I didn't even.  You smoked a rolled cigarette?  Yeah, I just, I needed to smoke.  Well, you really wanted to smoke.  Yeah, I forgot my goddamn cigarettes at home, so.  I think that was our intern, Dustin.  Dustin?  Dustin rolls his own cigarettes.  That's, he's one of the, uh, senior interns in the sense that he's 32 years old.  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah.  What is he, uh, planning on doing?  Uh, I don't know.  He drove a truck for a while, then he did this, then he did that, and now he's a radio  intern.  Should we talk to him?  Is he any, like, is he interesting at all?  He's a bit of a character. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Is it that guy that came in?  Drag him in here for a second.  Yeah, he's weird looking.  Just a fucking weird looking.  He used to have, uh, Jesus.  He rolled a perfect cigarette.  Kenny just hostily yelled at the door, Dustin, you listening to the show?  Get in here.  Hey, Dustin, why don't you grab a mic?  Uh, your name came up.  Good morning.  Yeah.  You kind of look like a guy that's in every commercial now.  Thank you.  Doesn't he?  Yeah.  Uh, now, now, how old a gentleman are you?  I'm 32 years young.  32. 
[02:06:30]  Okay, Uncle Paul.  32 years young.  And, uh, what made you want to intern for a radio?  I could understand, like, trying to figure out how to fucking weasel your way in to do  a show, or, or, you know, what, but interning is, wow, the bottom of the fucking rung, the  ladder there.  Yeah, that's where I'm at in life.  The bottom.  I'm a college student, digital design major, and, uh, well, I wanted to get into the  get more involved in audio manipulation.  32, though.  Yeah.  What happened between ending high school? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, wait, just wait.  Yeah?  Give him a, just give him two seconds to, he's trying to, he's, I just give him a second.  I feel so bad.  I feel, I don't know, I have something, it's something, I have a, a, something in my heart  with guys, uncomfortable men.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh.  He's looking a little uncomfortable right now.  And he's trying to figure out in his head how to maintain his, his dignity, his composure,  his, he's, he's practicing new, like, confidence moves. 
[02:07:30]  He's been waiting for this moment since he's been here.  Yeah.  Right.  And this is his big, big chance to maybe be the intern guy.  He's pulling his pants off.  He's doing the belt buckle stance.  Yeah, he's got his belt buckle.  No, I, just give him a 30 second, a little get it together, a little get it together.  All right, where, I'll give you some, some easy, easy ones here.  Where, like, where are you from?  Cincinnati, Ohio.  Cincinnati, Ohio.  Oh, the fucking chili and spaghetti capital.  Yeah, fuck it.  You been? 
[02:08:00]  I been, yeah.  Yeah, we were just, uh, talking about that.  So you have a three-way while you were there?  All right.  What's, what's that?  That's, uh, spaghetti, chili, and cheese.  Ugh.  Oh, a three-way.  What else do you call it in Cincinnati?  You gotta have a name for everything.  You gotta have a catchy name for everything.  Three-way is just sex.  I don't put nothing else.  Sounds sexy.  Yeah, three-way.  Sausage, peppers, and onions.  Did you fly really?  That's a three-way, too.  What a letdown that would be.  Hey, man, we got you a three-way all set up.  Great.  Here you go.  Chili, spaghetti, and cheese.  Great.  And do you enjoy that?  Oh, yeah.  I eat them all the time.  Yeah? 
[02:08:30]  It's delicious.  Or cheese cone-y.  That's a hot dog with chili and cheese, onion, mustard.  Just give me mustard.  I don't know, stop putting all this shit.  Hot dogs is the easiest fucking food.  It doesn't have to be complicated.  What's your name again, bro?  Dustin.  Dustin.  Dustin.  I like the way you say that.  See, the best part about also, you have to realize that, like, you're talking about  their dignity and stuff.  Like, these interns, 32 years old, we've had guys as old as 40.  They come in here, and they don't realize when they're interviewing that for the next three 
[02:09:00]  months, they're going to have to deal with the fact that 26-year-old me, just as  a little young punk is going to be bossing them around as their superiority.  That is really degrading.  Does that bother you just a little bit?  Oh, not a bit.  That's primetime Sam Roberts.  Wow.  I mean, that's been conditioned.  You are brainwashed.  Yes.  You are brainwashed.  All right.  I got to get into it.  What happened between high school...  Ed, thank you very much, man.  Yeah.  That was nice.  You can see he has the personality of someone that's going to die soon. 
[02:09:30]  I gave it a shot, Patrice.  I took your advice.  You really did.  I took your advice.  And thank you for that.  I gave him a few seconds.  You just said he looks like the guy for every commercial.  He's every commercial.  You really look like the guy that's using in every commercial now.  He's a lucky, funny-looking guy with a nice-looking wife.  Yeah, yeah.  On every sitcom and every commercial.  He's going, hey, how you doing?  You know?  Wow.  Yeah.  So now, between high school and now, what happened where you couldn't pursue this kind 
[02:10:00]  of thing a little earlier in life?  Oh, I pursued other things.  After I dropped out of high school, I went into Carpentry, Carpenters Union for a while.  I built a roller coaster.  Then it was truck driving, you know, OTR, coast to coast.  Over the road.  Yes, sir.  Right, right.  I never want to be a disappointed parent.  Did this just pop in your head, Patrice, for any particular reason?  I'm just sitting there going, this must be just phenomenally depressing to be a parent. 
[02:10:30]  You drop out of high school, and then you go into just the trades.  Yeah.  And he's still searching for what he's going to do.  Swinging a fucking hammer.  What's the kid up to?  He's building this roller coaster.  And he's very proud of the roller coaster thing, by the way, because he brought it up.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, build a roller coaster.  I build things.  Do you know how important that is to the world?  And then somehow, he relates it to Jesus, who was a carpenter also.  Yes, yes, of course.  I'm a simple man.  I like to use my hands.  My hands. 
[02:11:00]  He fucking still makes horseshoes.  Yeah.  You got an anvil in your house, motherfucker.  Yeah, I'm doing the drywall down at the new McDonald's.  He's the guy.  He's the guy that's like, you can keep all that Hollywood red carpet nonsense.  I like nothing better than an ice cold brewski at a front porch.  Meat and potatoes kind of guy, they call me.  So you're, you know, meat and potatoes guy.  Yeah, that's what's the business.  Let me see.  Do you roll the perfect cigarette, dude?  I will tell you that.  That's the fucking thing.  Oh, this was a cigarette guy? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, what the fuck is that about?  Practice makes perverts.  Practice makes perverts, but why do they sell them rolled with filters in them?  I can't afford to have people do that for me.  Oh, shit.  Interns' salary is zero, right?  So he smuggles in Tobago.  Yeah.  Where do you go get tobacco?  Yeah, where do you get just a pouch of tobaccy?  Ooh, now I gotta get me some more tobaccy.  You darn rabbit.  I'm a smoker and I don't know where the fuck to get straight tobacco.  Where do you fucking go get tobacco?  I don't even know where to get straight. 
[02:12:00]  I only know how to get it inside of other things that I'm purchasing.  Exactly.  Just get the ingredients.  I guarantee the answer isn't like, you get it from Walmart.  You gotta get it from this exact, this little place over by somewhere next to something else.  Yeah.  So you roll your own cigarettes.  Yeah.  Because you can't afford it.  Do you do anything to make money?  I mean, Christ, you can't just do this.  No, I just survive on my student loans from the government. 
[02:12:30]  Student loans at 32, you're taking out student loans.  Oh yeah, I'll be over $100,000 in debt in 2012.  Congratulations.  Why are you doing this?  I'm looking forward to that.  Why are you doing this?  And you're taking a fucking course that the highest you might get is $50,000 a year.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, it's interesting that you'd be doing this.  What's your major?  I'm majoring in how to get shit on on a national radio show.  They suggested that I intern. 
[02:13:00]  What about family life?  You're married, you got a girl, what's going on?  I'm all alone in the world except for like my father, brother, new niece, another nephew  or niece on the way.  What about that?  And the brother's getting pussy at least.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Live vicariously.  Yeah.  He hugs his niece and goes, boy, this is proof my brother gets pussy.  I don't like your intern's renegade attitude.  Yeah, it really is.  I'm just out there by myself on the open road.  Just me.  My lone wolf pack.  My fucking tabacky and my belt buckle. 
[02:13:30]  He'll have a great eulogy.  His story's boring now, but his eulogy will be great.  He rolled his own cigarettes.  Oh, it's going to sound like he's just a world traveler, a bon vivant.  And it's very disturbing, a guy like this, because there is an office shooting, because  his actual life is that he's destined for mediocrity at best.  Yeah, yeah.  But he doesn't want mediocrity, and there's no other way for him to get out of it.  And let me tell you something.  Someone who's proud to be in $100,000 debt in 2012 means he's going to take a few people 
[02:14:00]  out with him.  Yeah, yeah.  Meaning he has no intentions on paying it back.  He fucking has no one.  He has no one that he's going to leave that debt to.  That's going to be all.  Yeah.  He's alone.  He already said it.  He's going to fucking...  He's a fucking killer.  You are kind of a killer in the making.  Jordan Vandersloot.  Except for fucking...  Yeah.  I believe in him.  I think he's going to pull...  He'll be the guy that's a millionaire.  You'll be like, how are you a millionaire?  He's going to be like, all right, do you ever see how you open an orange juice carton 
[02:14:30]  into a little triangle thing?  I invented that.  That was me.  He'll invent something goofy like that, and he'll fucking make millions.  I'm going to tell you, he might be smart enough to invent it, but he's not smart enough  to have it patented.  Jesus.  Patrice.  Dude, you could feel...  I can't look at him.  Because this guy is...  He's dangerous, man.  He's a dangerous person right here, dude.  Any type of girl thing, or just nothing?  Do you date?  Do you...  Well, I find it hard here in the city. 
[02:15:00]  Women seem to have standards that they don't have out in the country.  It's a peculiar situation.  Yeah.  Well, their first standard is don't fuck a guy with a nightmare before a Christmas belt  buckle on.  Giant nightmare before a Christmas belt buckle.  You've got to get rid of that.  And polio shoes.  Too true.  Polio shoes.  They are some big black shoes.  Does he have fucking high-heeled, comfy shoes?  Yes.  The whole thing is high-heeled. 
[02:15:30]  He has on wedges.  He had an interesting style.  He liked mint-colored button-downs.  Yeah.  And orthopedic shoes.  Yeah, the shirt's kind of hanging on you a little bit there.  Oh, he is.  I lost a lot of weight since I moved to town.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Can't afford to eat.  Yeah.  Lack of eating.  Yeah, yeah.  Can't eat.  Oh, man.  Can't afford taxis.  Take this guy up.  Make this guy your Kenny, Patrice.  My who?  Make him your Kenny.  Yeah, the fuck.  Kenny is valuable. 
[02:16:00]  This fucking guy.  I can't afford him to have raping bitches at my shows.  Damn.  Killing the bitch in the closet, like, in the same hotel with me.  Fucking strangling holes or fucking Mexican maids a-missing.  I needed a rapey assistant to sell my DVDs after the show.  Fuck out of here, man.  You just come in here, and then you get a check from the government.  Yeah.  And you go to school, or is it, like, home courses or something?  Oh, no.  It's a real school.  It's a real school. 
[02:16:30]  University of Cincinnati.  Yeah.  So you're just doing this for the summer.  Yeah.  And then you go back to school.  Now, so you're in a school with, like, college kids?  Why is he trying to better himself as a middle-aged fucking man?  Yeah.  Don't you reach a point where you just go kind of, fuck it, I fucked up.  I missed the fucking train when it came to college.  Yeah, every day he does it.  Like, like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just like Patrice said every day, I think...  You can feel him.  What am I going to do?  End it all?  I have too much empathy.  No, no, you just work, and you kind of try to...  He's not going to end it all. 
[02:17:00]  You hear what I'm talking about.  These are things...  What am I going to do?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Kill myself?  Kill myself?  No.  I'm going to kill all the co-egs at Cincinnati.  Yeah.  Do the kids kind of look at you like, what the fuck is this guy doing?  Yeah, people are always asking me...  They call him sir, and they ask him directions.  Ask him directions.  Sir, do you know where...  Because he looks like a local...  And the faculty, like, ask you to please leave the campus.  Yes, and you have to always...  That's why he wears his ID on his pants.  He's got to do that at school.  He does that at school. 
[02:17:30]  Because he's lurking in the halls for fucking college girls.  Yeah, there's some guy hanging out looking for trim.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, no, I'm here trying to get a major.  I'm paying.  I'm a hundred grand in debt, motherfucker.  And he goes into class, right, and always gives the girls this disarming, trying to be  super friendly.  You're trying to be charming.  I'm just bettering myself, Miles.  Not only the classmates, but my professors, too.  I've got a few female professors that are younger than me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How's that work out for you?  Not at all.  No?  Do you have any game? 
[02:18:00]  It doesn't seem like you have much game.  He's trying to luck his way into some pussy.  What?  And my advice to you is, when you get some pussy, man, take it for what it's worth.  Don't try to be in a relationship with this girl, because you're going to end up, that's  going to be the crime spree.  That's going to be the fucking snapping point.  He's not going to, once he gets some chick that's fucking crazy enough to fucking fuck  him, he's going to be super into her, man.  If she leaves, he's the type that would go to her, her mother, her father, and then he 
[02:18:30]  left her house, went to her parents' house.  Not going to fucking ask the father, where the fuck is she?  Yeah, yeah.  And he's like, and the father's too scared to be a dad?  Plow, plow.  It's a fact, man.  Yeah.  Do you buy pussy, or you got too much fucking pride?  Well, I don't have enough money, or too much pride, whichever way you want to look at it.  50, $100 would get you a fucking prostitute, man.  You know, guys kind of need that outlet, companionship. 
[02:19:00]  Masturbate incessantly.  That gets dangerous, man.  If I knew I couldn't get pussy and jerk off like that.  Jerking off is fine if you know there's something, there's a light at the end of the fucking vagina.  Because sometimes I jerk off the shit where you go, I think I can get a girl like that.  So I jerk off to that girl, and you feel better.  But if you're just jerking off because you cannot get a girl, that's when it gets really dangerous.  Yeah, you've got to be a functioning alcoholic. 
[02:19:30]  You've got to still get out there and work.  Get out there and work.  You can't just jerk off all the time.  Oh, shit.  Can I ask you kind of a personal question?  When the last time was that you were amorous with a woman?  Let's take a bet.  You'll be honest about that?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go on it.  Let's do it.  Okay.  Let's do it.  $10.  $10?  $10.  $10.  Closest.  $10 on it.  Can I count the most recent if it was kind of a failure fizzle?  Or do I have to go back to the last?  You have to have had.  Don't give it away.  Yeah.  Your dick.  Right.  And there was some pumping and your dick was in and she wanted it. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Shit, you send a bar pretty high.  Why are your nipples at your belly button?  You are just a fucking horror show.  I'm going to...  This guy...  You've got to straighten up a little bit.  You've got to be honest, right?  So what's the bet?  What are we betting here?  How last time he got pushed?  We're going to pick a date.  A year.  Actually, a month and a year, just in case we're too close.  And whoever's closest to him, the date he actually got laid the last time, will win $30 
[02:20:30]  or $20 because it's your own 10 in there.  So who wants to go first?  Wow.  You go, Joe.  All right.  I'll say...  Where are we right now?  We're at August 2010.  I'm going to say it was...  Season, maybe?  What?  I don't know if I can narrow it down to a month.  All right.  We'll do a season.  Winter.  I'm going with winter because it's easier to get pussy in winter because everything's  covered up.  Okay, so we get the season and year.  Season and year.  Okay.  I'm going to go winter a year ago. 
[02:21:00]  And winter is the last part of...  Like, if you say winter of 2009, that's, you know, last winter.  Like, I'm going to go winter, a full two years ago winter.  So whatever that is, 2008.  So winter of 2008, right?  So you're going winter...  Well, it hasn't been winter of 2010 yet, so...  Or wait, yes, it has.  Just say the...  Yeah, winter of 2008.  Winter of 2008, I'm going to go with.  All right.  Winter...  Winter...  You want to jot that down?  So we don't forget winter... 
[02:21:30]  Oh, you got it?  Winter 2008.  Let me think.  Let me think.  I'm going to say...  I'm a hopeless romantic, so I'm going to say spring.  I'm going to say spring...  2006.  Ooh.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm going back.  I'm going to do the Price is Right shit.  Oh, you motherfucker.  And I'm going to go...  I'm going to go...  Fall...  of 2005.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:22:00]  Fall 2005.  Spring 2006.  Winter 2008.  Because I'm trying to scenario it on what the...  What scenario could have happened for him to have gotten...  Had lucked into some pussy.  Well, let me hear your little theory about...  I'm thinking school.  I'm thinking early.  I'm thinking nervous bitches who haven't gained their confidence.  I'm thinking of a freshman or a sophomore.  A chick in school.  Where he's kind of a mystery older guy because he's still in his 20s and ain't pathetic. 
[02:22:30]  So why fall?  They already know him by then.  Well, school starts in fall.  Oh, school starts.  Okay.  And so I'm saying by the time they know he ain't shit, it was...  It hasn't been winter yet.  So I say fall of 2005.  That was my idea.  That was my thinking.  All right.  But I'm saying that it...  I mean, God damn it.  A year is way too early.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, I'm going to the theory that a year, even for a no pussy guy, is a dry spell. 
[02:23:00]  Two years, maybe.  Look at him.  Any longer than that.  I mean, God damn.  Because I was a no pussy guy for a long time.  But I mean, two fucking years.  I'm going fucking 2006, my friend.  I'm going 2005.  Wow.  Patrice is really backing up.  All right.  The answer is summer 2008.  So Joe DeRosa is the closest.  Joe DeRosa wins. 
[02:23:30]  Could we have a little...  Maybe a little recap of that amorous moment you had.  Shit.  I know.  Shit.  I could have...  Tell you, man.  A year to two years is the most, dude.  Before that, it was seven years.  Fuck, so I was close.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  The reality of it.  Fuck.  You got...  Would your dick slip in somebody on it when you trip?  A year to two years is a long time, dude.  Fuck.  You got to think back to...  How'd you get it?  What happened?  Yeah.  How was the story there with the last one?  Craigslist.  Craigslist?  Emails.  So you're talking about... 
[02:24:00]  That's like a prostitute.  That shouldn't fucking count.  That's a prostitute.  Well, we dated for like three months, though.  Oh.  Oh, you just...  You met her.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you paid.  No.  Man, we should have...  We should have had criteria, man.  I know, yeah.  Those bitches are...  She was a mess, too, right?  Was she a disaster?  She enjoyed wine, fetish, kid.  She was a mess.  Wow.  Two dogs.  It wasn't like a girl you met.  I was giving you credit for like a fucking goddamn college girl, you motherfucker.  I know.  He's meeting someone in school.  That'd be nice.  I tried.  Yeah.  Good luck with that.  But I was 10 years older than them, balding. 
[02:24:30]  You know, I don't have the personality that you have.  Oh.  That was passive-aggressive.  It was passive-aggressive.  Hey, we're in the same boat, fat nigger.  But we're not.  No, no.  No, no.  Well, fuck yourself, cocksucker.  You think I didn't catch that either?  Boy, there you go.  I can't give a white boy a second.  I caught that, too.  I caught that.  You said it before I did.  Hey, I don't have the personality you have.  If you didn't, you'd be like me, too, you fat fucking...  Gorilla. 
[02:25:00]  Big gorilla rapist.  You fuck face.  You're probably going bald, too, there, tits.  What an asshole you are.  Good for you.  Oh, goddamn.  Tits.  That's great.  Yeah, because you fucking always got to fucking laugh your way into some pussy, lucky boy.  Goddamn.  I fucking saw that, and that was done on purpose.  My Aryan features are much better. 
[02:25:30]  You know, I'm glad you said it so I don't look like a fucking dick.  I saw that a mile away.  Yeah, we're in...  Hey, you're one laugh away from me.  No, I'm not.  That's exactly what he was saying.  That's classic, man.  Motherfucker.  What a dick.  Motherfucker.  I was feeling for him at first.  You motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  Well, we got...  I guess Forrest is here.  Why don't we catch up a little on taking breaks, and then we'll have Forrest come in right 
[02:26:00]  after we take a break, okay?  That'll work.  Very good, Steve.  Very good, everybody.  Be right back.  Let me have your attention for a moment.  This is a Volpe and Anthony show on the Virus Sirius XM.  All right.  Hope you're an Anthony show.  Again, Joe DeRosa and Patrice O'Neal. 
[02:26:30]  And now, let us bring in Forrest Griffin to the show.  Forrest, how you doing, man?  Good.  Big guy.  Jesus.  Oh, shit.  You're already bored out there.  Maybe I want to make fun of people, too, you know?  I know.  Sorry.  They had the curtains shut.  I didn't even see anybody out there.  I hate when they shut the curtains in here.  We can't put a naked girl on a computer without fucking battening down the hatches.  I'll tell you what.  I like the curtains shut.  It creates an illusion of something good's happening. 
[02:27:00]  Like something's going on in here?  And then I get in here.  Imagine my disappointment.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of dudes.  When the curtains are shut.  Yeah, it's like, hey, this is the place to be.  I was like, these guys know how to do it.  I thought something fancy was happening.  How big is Lesnar, man?  Because you're fucking huge, dude.  A child compared to him, right?  No, seriously.  He's a big man.  You're an imposing looking dude.  You know, I don't have...  And how big is that fucker, man?  I don't have what they call muscles.  I'm like country boy big, you know?  Right, street big.  You just take up a couple of cows. 
[02:27:30]  They call it retard strength.  Like you just knock a building down with your fucking actual...  Very uncoordinated.  Look, he's a monster.  And the scary thing is his arms are so long.  How are they that big, you know?  He's a monster.  When I first started watching the UFC, when I really enjoy that shit, when I first started  watching it, they used to just have, you know, if you was a midget that was a 10th degree  black belt, you fought a giant who was a judo.  Oh, but why did that...  Is that...  Are they looking to... 
[02:28:00]  Like, because you got to fight fucking...  It makes the sport out of it, you know?  Could you fight...  Would you fight him if you wanted to?  I mean, the money was there, sure.  I mean, would I do well?  Would I do the rest of my life?  Maybe.  I don't know.  But I'm saying, back in the day, they used to...  It used to be, okay, I'm a fucking karate expert, no matter how big I am, and I'm a fighter  guy who's a fucking...  That's what it was when I started.  And then they just...  Now it's just weight classes.  Yeah, it's like an organized sport with rules and regulations.  It makes sense now. 
[02:28:30]  I like that ring, though.  I'm all about the pinky ring.  Thank you, sir.  You know, the guy that couldn't get laid had a pinky ring.  What was that about?  I figure, seriously, I figure a pinky ring has got to be...  Did it have Frodo Baggins' face on it?  Fucking dorky belt buckle that he was wearing.  Evidently, I'm the same way, you know.  He's like...  He's that son of a bitch, man.  I thought the pinky ring was a good thing.  I was like, oh.  Nah, not for him.  I thought it was one of those things where, like, if you were a pinky, you must have some  swagger.  You know, you got something going on.  It doesn't work for him. 
[02:29:00]  Not at all.  I should steal that from him.  Be like, dude, you don't deserve it.  Yeah.  Forrest, the book here.  Be ready when the shit goes down.  A survival guide to the apocalypse.  Now, this sounds pretty cool.  Yeah, because it's awesome.  I wanted the title to be, you better be ready when the shit goes down, Forrest Griffin's  guide to the apocalypse and other stories that don't involve bunnies.  God bless.  But they said no good on that.  Like, it would take up the whole thing.  But now, what's the gist of this?  I guess this isn't a book about UFC. 
[02:29:30]  No, not at all.  Please.  But, I mean, even if you think it is, buy it and be disappointed.  I don't care.  So, these are some of your ideas.  It's pretty self-explanatory.  Yeah, your ideas about surviving.  For what it's worth, I've done the research.  Oh, you have?  Oh, yeah.  I'm out there.  This isn't just your opinion.  Because I would think, I would just jot things down like what I think.  When I get back, I'm going to take some more gun classes, learn how to properly break  down my rifles and clean them.  Yeah.  Well, shooting's the easy part. 
[02:30:00]  It's all that.  Oh, shit.  You know, I teamed up with my boy Erish there, and he made me live out in the desert a little  bit on nothing.  Yeah.  So, you got to be careful.  That's how I've encountered that.  What's your favorite gun?  The H&K, the .45.  I also like the Glock .45 a lot.  Heckler & Koch, very good gun.  Expensive.  Get out.  I have a .40.  I have an HK .40.  Yeah, my wife's got that.  I'm a man, so I have a .45.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, 
[02:30:30]  I got big hands.  I need a bigger gun.  Girl hands.  All right, look.  Hey, this is how awesome.  That was my wife's, like, birthday present.  I just want to.  He has a chick's automatic weapon.  Let me do a little explaining here.  First of all, it's a carry gun, because it's a little smaller.  Yeah, I just carry a carry gun.  It fits right in your purse.  Fuck you, the rosette.  Hey, is yours pink?  It'll fit in your fucking mouth.  Is your wife's gun pink, sir?  No, no, no.  No, it's easy. 
[02:31:00]  Secondly, I have a fuckload of .45s.  I love a good .45 fucking cult custom.  Oh, so HK is a .45.  HK is a .40.  They make .45s.  Yeah, it's a brand.  I thought HK was a...  That's the brand.  HK is the brand.  Come on, you've got to start listening to the most indie.  So where's the fucking weapons?  Like, what's the...  How about your...  Okay, that's your favorite?  That's what a TI song's about.  That's a piss song.  The best guns.  I love TI.  The fact that he got arrested trying to buy automatic weapons.  That was like... 
[02:31:30]  I already liked him because he was from Atlanta.  And then when he got arrested for that, I was like, that dude's my hero.  And his music's pretty good.  Automatic weapons.  Yeah, I was like, ah, he's awesome.  It's a no-no.  No, it's awesome.  Man, do you know how long does it take?  I don't know.  New York's stupid.  I hate it here.  But to get automatic weapons, the permits, forever.  I got silencers.  You can't...  Now, where do you live, though?  You got silencers?  Nevada.  Yeah, you're in Nevada.  I thought that was a federal thing.  You can't have silencers.  I filled out my paperwork, brother.  You can have a silencer.  Yeah.  You can get automatic weapons, too.  But where I live, you have to actually have like a storefront property. 
[02:32:00]  You gotta be a dealer.  Yeah.  A firearms dealer with a storefront.  But I...  And I can be a firearms dealer, no problem.  But you have to have that storefront.  Yeah, they can't just...  So I'm not gonna pay rent somewhere.  You also have to have an immovable safe.  So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff.  I'm just like, all right.  And then there's a stack of paperwork, too.  When New York is crazy.  How do you get a silencer thing?  I just kept filling out paperwork and paying the tax stamps.  So they finally go, all right, you're allowed to kill somebody in their sleep and sneak  out their house?  No, they're like, well, I mean, they're like, yes, if you kill someone, there's no way 
[02:32:30]  we won't find you for doing it.  That's basically, they're like, all right, you are already caught.  Just do it because it's fun.  Sounds cool.  Oh, yeah, that...  No, it's great.  You can hear it click.  Yeah, it's like a clicking sound.  You hear the fucking mechanics of the gun.  You can hear it strike the bullet.  Yeah.  It's not like James Bond, though, where it goes, pew, pew, and that's like a fake sound.  No, it's more like a tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of a sound, yeah.  I like that noise from the movie.  I know, the movie silences sound a lot cooler. 
[02:33:00]  But your gun doesn't sound like, like when you shoot your gun, it doesn't sound like when  Indiana Jones shoots his gun, right?  It depends on what gun you're shooting.  If I'm shooting my faggot H&K 40, the gun of the queer, that, see, look, that's my fucking  carry gun and he's dissing it.  Look at that thing.  Does cum come out of it?  Your gun has a period. 
[02:33:30]  Wait, so where's the man version of that one?  The .45?  You're not going to be able to tell too much difference.  You've got to hold it in your hand.  They're pretty similar, yeah.  But I have a few .45s.  I love those.  I have a little...  How do you do that in New York?  What's going on here?  Oh, yeah.  I filled out a lot of paperwork.  Nonsense.  All kinds of stuff you've got to go through.  I love it.  Love it.  Nevada, Las Vegas.  Walk into a store.  Do whatever you want to do.  Yeah, not here in New York.  They're very tricky. 
[02:34:00]  And the laws about transporting guns and...  Like, I can...  I also have a license in Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  But I'm not allowed to go through Jersey.  Yeah.  Like, so it's...  It's just...  I think...  Oh, you can't even have it.  I should probably stay mum on the subject, but I'm going to do what I want to do.  Yeah, you know what?  The Constitution says...  Has the Second Amendment.  It's supposed to cover the country.  What the fuck?  Hey, and as we're talking about it, workplace shooting.  Three dead.  All right. 
[02:34:30]  See, if somebody in the workplace had a legal gun...  That's correct.  Maybe they would have taken the guy out.  That's what I say.  What about rifles?  Yeah, I mean, I got a couple ARs.  Yeah.  I got the SL8.  I wanted the G36, but it's real hard to come by.  Yeah, I'm looking for the SCAR right now.  That's like the next one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  SL8.  What's the...  Oh, shit.  That's...  Yeah, that's a good look.  Damn, that's about...  That's fourth...  That's level four.  Level four.  I wanted the... 
[02:35:00]  In a video game.  I wanted the G36, but that's a tough gun to get.  Some of them are hard to get.  I just picked up a SP89.  What's the new rifle?  It's like an MP5.  I don't know what that means.  The military is going to a new rifle.  What is it?  I was just looking at this.  XM9.  Yes, it is.  The XM9.  I'm going to get one of those now.  Now you got to get...  I know.  Every new one that comes out, I'm like, oh, I got to get that.  Oh, I got to get that one.  But your baddest gun is the 50 Cal, right?  Yeah, the Barrett is the sickest fucking gun ever. 
[02:35:30]  It's the M104.  XM9.  50 Cal.  10 shot.  Semi-automatic.  And when you fire this thing, I've said it before, it feels like you have the flu for  three seconds.  I've shot him a couple times.  You're all fucked up.  It's a concussive burst.  Yeah, yeah.  Snipers actually get concussion syndrome.  They get knocked out a lot when they shoot them.  Yeah, it's not like a...  It's not the kick.  Yeah, it's your brain is liquid.  Yeah.  And it actually...  No, this is true.  It's actually shaking the liquid that is your brain because your brain smells the water. 
[02:36:00]  It feels like you're ready to get a nosebleed if you fire too many rounds.  We were shooting one and it blew...  I had like full bottles of water and it just blew them off the table.  Oh, it blows them off the table.  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, yeah, I don't...  I don't really need that.  I don't...  We're shooting like a barrel.  You don't really need them, but they're just fun to fucking shoot.  I'm trying to think like, when am I going to be shooting through a car?  Yeah.  Do I need this?  But you know what?  If you ever have to, look at...  You're talking about your book here. 
[02:36:30]  Hey.  I'm out in the...  My solution is to go far away from people.  Yeah, you see a fucking vehicle start pulling up.  You're going to want to disable that engine.  That is true.  A barra would be perfect for it.  Yeah, I've actually heard...  Yeah, that's great.  What about...  Oh, by the way.  Does this guy over here just research whatever you're talking about?  Yes.  He pops on...  That guy's...  Danny's the best at popping shit up.  It's pretty awesome.  Oh, that's the barra right there.  That's true.  Hey, uh...  Yeah, why don't you crank that up?  Am I correct? 
[02:37:00]  The guy that I shoot, his, uh...  He said it's four bucks a shot.  How much does it cost?  Four dollars and fifty cents per shot.  Four dollars and fifty cents?  Yeah.  It's, uh...  For a bullet?  Yeah, yes sir.  Yeah, I don't need that.  I don't need that gun.  And Danny's like, Jesus fucking Christ, it felt like I was being shot.  I mean, you just said so, but if you stand in the direction of that suppressor, you're  feeling the entire thing, and it just kind of hits you in the chest.  It blew, like I said, it blew like, you know, water bottles off the deck. 
[02:37:30]  The suppressor directs the blast back at about a 45 degree angle behind you, so if people  are standing next to you, they get more of the shit than you do.  Yeah.  You kind of don't realize it, but being on the side of that thing is not the best place  to be.  Yeah, I wouldn't...  I would be behind that.  Yeah, directly behind is the best.  It's a great, great fun gun to shoot, though.  And during the apocalypse or zombie invasion, uh, I would want to have those for the long  range, but now you're talking about pistols, uh, the 45, that's great, big manly gun,  but let me tell you about my Desert Eagle, the .50 Cal Desert Eagle. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  That's a fucking gun.  You know, that is a man's gun.  That is a great gun.  That is a great gun for a guy with a small penis that has to do some overcompensation.  Look, you have a small gun, a big gun, what about a Walther PPK?  Does that mean I have a giant cock and I don't have to compensate?  You're secure, yeah.  I feel good about myself.  You know, again, I just don't need the, uh...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Keep going, but...  Do you have questions? 
[02:38:30]  I've seen, I was saying, I've seen this picture a couple of times.  I'm actually glad you're here.  I don't, I'm trying to figure, is that a, is that real?  That's the bedspread.  So they sent me that bedspread.  What is that, Patrice?  I don't know.  It's just like people that make a bedspread with like hot chicks making out on it.  Oh.  And I used it for a while.  Oh, it's a bedspread.  That's not your wife.  No, no.  Dude, I thought that was...  Look, did you see this picture?  It'd be a lot cooler if it was, but it's not.  That's just the bedspread.  And I gotta look through the pictures.  I love books with pictures in them.  I know you do.  Fucking books with pictures rule. 
[02:39:00]  I can make it, yeah.  I know, I hate words.  Oh, shit, that's funny.  Yeah, words are hard.  Uh, wow, yeah, that, that's kind of cool.  This chick's making out on a bedspread.  This is a very fucking gonna be bought book, by the way.  This is very, uh, when somebody just does this and it's the way, the way that you're...  Yeah, well, you know, I front-loaded it.  The first 50 pages, well, 30 or 40 pages, pretty good.  And then it sucks.  And then the end's strong.  So, this is...  I really, I know how to write a book.  It's like a movie, you know?  The middle's not that important, really.  A couple of pictures of you with different faces, doing, like, there's a book I had one 
[02:39:30]  time called The Boys Book.  Shows you how to tie knots.  Dangerous book for boys.  Yes, yes.  Tie knots, dude.  This is like, kind of...  It's not the same, but I'm saying it's like, you look at it and go, oh, okay, I'll buy it.  Like, how to make a pocket pussy.  Was that in the dangerous book for boys?  Because that's in my book.  Oh, that is?  Because you're going to need that.  Yeah, I mean, you know.  What do you...  Or a prison pussy, whatever you prefer.  What do you think will be this apocalypse?  What do you think will cause the shit going down? 
[02:40:00]  What is the shit?  Well, I've got a lot of theories, but look at it this way.  And this is, you know, quasi-realistic.  Think about it.  You got so many people using so much shit.  And I know you do it till you drive to the drive-thru.  You eat your food in your little cardboard container.  And then, like me, after I've eaten too much food and consumed too much, I go in an air-conditioned  gym and run on an electric treadmill and use more energy to get rid of the energy I already  over-consumed.  And we got 300 million people doing this. 
[02:40:30]  It's, I mean...  Oh, it reminds me of that.  In the economy, they call it...  Exactly.  In the economy, they call it a correction.  There's too many people using too much shit.  It's got to come to an end sooner or later.  I'm just getting ready.  And then, so, whatever the shit is, it could be disease outbreak, it could be...  I think we're going to lose our credit rating as a country because our deficit's so high,  we're actually no longer a safe investment.  And when we lose that credit rating, what are we?  Just a dude with a big gun that's broke. 
[02:41:00]  And that's the thing that's going to keep us from being Rome, though.  See, that's the thing.  People always compare this to Rome.  The difference between Rome and America is Rome didn't have the threat to go, all right,  since we're not who we are anymore, I'm going to just blow the whole world up.  Like, I'm going to kill everybody.  Yeah.  Rome couldn't do that.  That didn't work for Russia.  But no one is willing to destroy the whole earth.  Plus, the theory of economy...  We're willing to destroy the whole earth.  We're just doing it slowly. 
[02:41:30]  Yes, America has proven that they will fucking do something really foul.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:42:00]  These volcanoes.  No, no, we're doing it.  I mean, the planet might cleanse itself every now and again, but it's us.  There's going to be a correction.  I'm hoping race war.  There's too many people doing too much shit.  Yeah.  You know?  I'm waiting for a race war.  Yeah.  I think that's going to happen.  That was more like a 70s health shelter type deal.  I don't know.  It's going to be like publish against the fucking...  I don't know if you're writing old dude in prison, but I don't think that one worked out.  Yeah.  I don't think it's going to happen.  I don't think it's going to happen.  I don't think it's going to happen.  Nah, nah.  Anything that guy said is probably wrong. 
[02:42:30]  Me, on the other hand, I'm a modern day prophet.  Oh, so you've kind of got this shit down.  I mean, it's in the book.  It's going to happen.  I know it's happening, and I've discussed how and why.  Like I said, we're going to lose our credit rating.  People won't load us money.  We're fucked.  We all live on credit.  Yeah, but then we're fucked as a country, so what?  They'll just be chaos.  We'll do something stupid.  In order to save ourselves like a last ditch effort.  Exactly, yes.  And we'll fuck up.  I think we should start hiring our military out.  Oh, that's kind of a good idea.  Make a lot of money. 
[02:43:00]  We got some of the best shit.  Yeah.  So, and then we can just not.  No reason letting that go to pot.  I'm just flipping through this book.  Forrest is a fucking dangerous guy, man.  He's like.  Oh, fuck yeah.  So, he's well versed in like, in firearms.  He fucking can fight like, with his fists.  It's like, he's really a fucking movie star.  And I'll have you know, I've burned myself with a lighter for 16 seconds.  Holy shit.  On your hand or arm or whatever?  Right, right.  That giant scar right there.  16 seconds.  It's harder than you think.  And when you start smelling your own flesh going.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:43:30]  Come on.  My last fight, I asked the doctor not to give me the anesthesia before the stitches.  He wouldn't.  He gave me.  He still gave me the number.  You wanted to feel.  I just wanted to tell the story of being a hard ass.  Now, you.  I saw Matt Hoffman stitching himself up.  And I saw this kid, Tommy Sauer, who actually has Tourette's.  He's used to be a fighter.  Real good fighter back in.  He's one of those guys.  He made it before the sport made it.  So, he got nothing out of it.  Yeah.  He's like.  I've never feel those guys.  Yeah.  You know, one of those guys like fucking the Jens Pulver. 
[02:44:00]  But he didn't even make it that far, you know.  And he has Tourette's.  And then he's stitching my face up after a fight.  And he has Tourette's.  And then, you know, I wouldn't have let him do that except right before he stitched me,  he stitched himself.  So, I was like, all right.  This dude's legit.  Would you be you without the sport?  Like, me and all the stuff you're into now.  Would you be.  Yeah.  I mean, I'd be a weird dude.  Yeah.  I mean, if that's what you mean.  No.  I wasn't going to fucking say weird.  I didn't say weird.  I mean, as a. 
[02:44:30]  Just the stuff that you had to.  No, I'd be.  I'd be a weird dude.  But it was the weirdness that led me to the sport of fighting.  You know?  It was like, ah, fighting people.  That seems cool.  And I didn't.  Like, for me, it was always more of a fight club thing.  Now these dudes are professional fucking athletes.  This is craziness.  You know?  I just want to make sure I whoop somebody's ass on the street and stab them in the throat.  What's the worst UFC guy movie you've seen since you guys have been being in the movies?  I'll tell you mine.  I'll tell you what.  A lot.  I've seen one and it was bad. 
[02:45:00]  I only saw Red Belt.  Red Belt was the only one I saw.  Yeah.  Well, you know, they get a lot of little parts and other stuff.  I think that Scorpion King was pretty bad, right?  I never saw it.  Oleg Tiktarov's done great, you know?  Oleg has been in some good fucking shit.  He's been in some great films.  He was just in Predator, the new Predator.  He's been in a ton of stuff.  Another one called 15 Minutes.  It was great.  I like the star of that.  I like 15 Minutes.  That's a good movie, man.  With De Niro?  Yeah.  When he gets stabbed, that's a good movie.  I didn't like that movie.  You know what?  You don't like it because it doesn't have a good ending.  It has kind of a lingering ending and the guy dies and it's weird and you think the movie's 
[02:45:30]  over but it keeps going.  I didn't even get to the end.  I watched like the first 15 minutes actually and I was like, this movie stinks.  It's all you can sit there.  Well, that's because De Niro gets stabbed and it's just too hard to watch De Niro not live through  a fucking movie.  You get a little attached to that shit.  I saw Rich Franklin in something that was a universal soldier.  Yeah, I didn't even see it.  It was like he was a robot soldier.  Oh, I'm taking it.  Bad.  Pretty bad. 
[02:46:00]  You know who's actually good?  Andre Evlovsky.  It's because you can't really understand what the fuck he's saying anyway.  What was he in?  He was in some fucking, it was a universal soldier type deal.  It was really good though.  They're all that kind of movie.  I like that shit.  It's the future.  I got a real good spot.  I hope they serve beer in hell.  Just a little cameo because I like the book.  How long before one of you guys does one of those like, you know, he's a spy on his toughest  mission yet. 
[02:46:30]  Babysitting.  You know, I make fun of those guys all day long.  Like, you remember when The Rock used to, I thought he was going to be the next Arnold  Schwarzenegger.  You remember that?  Yeah.  I vaguely remember that.  You remember.  He did the tooth fairy thing.  You remember, you know who I'm mad at because I really, Matthew McConaughey.  He did Frailty.  He was awesome.  He did that Dragon movie.  He was awesome in it.  The movie wasn't great, but he was awesome in it.  Right.  And now he like, he keeps making, he keeps making movies with the, with the, the blonde 
[02:47:00]  broads.  I mean, stop, stop.  They stink.  You know, you lost me.  And they're really emasculating.  But you know what?  You know what?  Yes.  But, you know, paychecks are cashing, brother.  Just totally emasculating a guy like Matthew McConaughey.  But I mean, it always goes back to that, but in reality, what you're saying about The  Rock, it's like you go, man, can you just do something where you can,  use the charisma kind of thing that you have?  Because these fucking kid movies.  Maybe John Cena will do it.  John Cena.  John Cena's acting's not great, but if you see like interview, like non-wrestling 
[02:47:30]  stuff, he's got a great personality.  He's a funny, charismatic guy.  Well, his movies are theoretically bad, but they're not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're watchable.  Meaning they should be.  Again, universal soldier type stuff, though.  No, well, it's like he's a, okay.  Anyway, he's always a, for some reason, a in his prime, retired Navy SEAL.  He's a 22-year-old retired, so he has to be like a fucking, he has to be, he works at 
[02:48:00]  McDonald's now.  Yeah.  And then someone tries to steal like some buns in the back.  And he uses some of that fucking shit he learned in the SEALs.  Basically the under siege all over again.  Right, under siege.  So they got to make up some shitty backstory about why he retired at 22.  Yeah.  And it's always like.  I lost too many men in that last one.  It's always somebody fucking, their kid dies or their wife dies.  Some kid dies accidentally.  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of it.  Come with something new.  He goes out and he was a fucking, like, just a loner for five years.  But you know, the thing is like, we keep buying that crap. 
[02:48:30]  They keep making the same crap and I keep going and seeing it, thinking it's going to  be different.  Well, that's why, man, when you talk about The Rock, when he went into movies and shit,  I remember that time when it was supposed to be that he was going to be this next action  hero.  But I remember not being that excited about it because you know, you're like, they're  not going to let it happen.  They're not going to make Commando with The Rock.  It's going to be shitty.  And it fucking was.  Except Walking Tall was the one where I was like, yeah, this is cool.  He's kicking the shit out of everybody. 
[02:49:00]  So you're like, yeah, let's go somewhere.  But you know, they're not going to have Predator with The Rock.  You know what?  Speaking of Predator real quick, I walked out of Predators in the theater.  The new one?  Yeah.  Fucking.  Well, you don't stay in movies, do you?  No.  You know why?  Because he's.  I'm an attention span over here.  I was excited.  Here we go.  I was excited to see it.  I was excited to see it.  I went in.  I left.  Because Predator 1, 30 minutes into the fucking movie, this one Predator has taken out Jesse  Ventura, Carl Weathers, damn near killed Schwarzenegger. 
[02:49:30]  This is the baddest thing on the planet.  The new one, there's four fucking Predators.  Halfway through the movie, everybody's alive, including Adrian fucking Brody.  It's still alive.  But you know what?  I was writing four fucking Predators.  But hold up.  You hear what he's mad at, right?  Yeah.  It's like, why not be mad at the fact that they're on another planet?  That part bought me too.  Like, why can't you put the suspension of disbelief on the fact that.  No, I thought it was fucking wrong.  It's like Alien.  I like that movie.  You know, it's like Alien. 
[02:50:00]  The first Alien, it kills everybody.  The second one, they're like, oh, they just die easy now, all of a sudden.  You know what?  I hate when the movie changes its tone.  Like, halfway through, one's killed everybody.  Yeah, the rules change.  And then like 100 of them can't kill 10 people.  Yeah, it's annoying.  That part did bother me in Predators when they realize they're on another planet and they  just go, all right, clearly we're not on Earth.  Let's get our thoughts together.  Yeah, no, but what are you going to do?  You would have a fucking stroke.  Fuck, you want it to be real? 
[02:50:30]  How about if every movie was real?  It'll be five seconds.  The Predator would have killed them.  Listen.  The Predator dogs would have killed them.  Listen.  Not real, but just take two minutes and take it all in.  And really like some realistic, holy fuck, I'm on another planet.  No, no.  MTV Generation, we don't have two minutes, son.  You got 15 seconds.  Yeah.  Oh, it stinks, man.  By the way, sir.  This guy, Big John.  Yes.  I can't find where I need like the actual info on it.  Yeah.  But is this guy, was he a really in-conditioned Big John at some point? 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, he was, there should be a picture of him all jacked up.  There's one, is that him?  Yeah, that's him.  So is he, what is he, an uncle or a friend?  He was my best friend.  He passed away, actually.  Oh, he died?  Okay, I'm sorry.  The book's dedicated to him, it was one of those things.  He was going to come on the book tour with me, because he's, he, everybody's got that  one person that is just such a fool that they can make you bring that out of you, and he  was that guy for me. 
[02:51:30]  So a lot of the stories are about him, were told by him.  He also had a real good memory.  Like, he remembers all these ludicrous things we've done, you know, whereas I intentionally  forget them.  What did he pass away from?  I'm not 100% sure.  You know, it was probably like, uh, just a buildup of drugs, perhaps.  Oh, so he had a crazy life.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, he had a crazy life.  All right.  So, because he's, because he's prominent, and I didn't, I didn't read it, but I'm looking  after that.  Yeah, no, he was my best friend.  And actually, you know, the book was done.  And, uh, you know, then he ended up passing away right, uh, at the end there, so. 
[02:52:00]  There you go.  Sorry, brother.  No worries.  It's, uh, hey, look at it this way.  We're all going to die.  Everybody.  Who's your best friend in the game?  Not you.  In the game?  Fighting?  Uh, well, whatever, whatever.  You know, who's your, I know you have this guy, Big John was your best friend, but it's  like, who's.  Well, I like, uh, Tim Crater, Gray Maynard, Mike Pyle, Jay Huron.  Those are the people I train with.  Tyson Griffin, you know.  So, these are my buddies, you know. 
[02:52:30]  Cool, man.  What about, uh.  People I would call, feel comfortable calling if I needed a ride somewhere.  Or it was like, drunk in jail, hey, can you bail me out?  Do you have a mentor?  At all?  Not really.  Not that I know of.  I mean, my stepdad pops.  He's pretty awesome.  You know.  Okay.  I actually had two stepdads.  One passed away, and they're both crazier than shit.  My mom has weird-tasting dudes.  Really, huh?  Yeah.  So, I love it.  I love it, though.  You know.  What's, uh, I got, getting back to the book, of course, surviving the apocalypse, uh, apocalypse 
[02:53:00]  here.  Uh, what would you think is, like, the most important thing to, to making it through a catastrophe?  Well, obviously, there's luck.  Obviously, depending on, you know, whatever.  But I'd say clean water.  Clean water.  Clean water.  Doesn't sound very exciting.  It's not like lopping heads off with machetes and stuff.  Yeah.  What's, I mean, what's the longest you've ever gone with, like, desalization tablets?  I don't know.  Have you actually ever tried to make it out anywhere without clean water? 
[02:53:30]  Uh, no.  Well, we toted some in.  I stayed in the Mojave Desert for about 10 days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were trying to find, you know, this is how, uh, oh, man, there's, what's the name?  There's some stuff in the book about him, too.  Uh, what's the name?  He died out in the, uh, fucking UFC guy.  Tanner.  Evan Tanner.  Thank you.  Good friend of mine.  Can't remember his name, but no, it was, he was an acquaintance, not a friend, but, but,  uh, yeah, that's how he passed away, you know, and you will, we'll go out there like  where we think the water is and, and hopefully it, we, you know, put the stuff in it and hopefully 
[02:54:00]  it's drinkable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So yeah.  Water.  You don't realize.  Can you drink out of a lake?  That's just dirty.  You can't do that.  Like, no, yeah, you can.  Sometimes you can get away with it.  Sometimes you get, you know, bacteria that, that, that wipe your system out and sometimes you  can adapt.  Can you, can you do it a Brita?  No bullshit.  Like, can you clean that water up with a Brita if you had a Brita?  It will take out some impurities, but I don't think it takes out bacteria.  They got tablets.  They got those little fucking stir, those stir fucking lights. 
[02:54:30]  You put the light in there and stir it with some fucking ultraviolet light.  It kills.  Really?  It kills, it's killing stuff.  Yeah.  I never even, I didn't know that existed.  It's the future.  Well, you won't be surviving the apocalypse now, will you?  I'd be the first one dead in this room without question.  Boiling helps.  Yeah.  Boiling's good.  But boiling doesn't kill everything.  Most everything.  I would do it.  You could drink that.  I would drink boiled water.  So can you pull off one of those, um, the Bear Grylls show?  Like, we drop you in a...  I'd love to.  Could I, I mean...  I mean, saying, would you be into that shit? 
[02:55:00]  Dude, I would just do the easiest thing.  I'd eat the fucking cameraman.  That's good.  Bear Grylls is constantly drinking his own piss.  Because it's like, you go, dude, this camera guy, like, you just go, there's one guy that  tapes himself, which you almost go, that's fucking...  Yeah, the guy that just sets up his own shots and walks by.  Oh, and you know his eyes is all fucked up from the dark survivor, man.  The thing is, that dude, he's so legit.  The thing about him is, uh, first of all, he could really die out there.  There's nobody, you know, Bear Grylls, the guys obviously will radio in. 
[02:55:30]  All right, shit's gone too far.  He's fucked up, whatever.  But the survivor, man, he didn't even get the good stuff on film, you know?  Yeah, because he's busy doing it.  He, like, shows him there's a huge hole in his leg.  He's like, I fell down.  I fell down.  It was horrible.  Very traumatic.  I don't know how far I fell.  I think it was about 30 feet.  He's not, like, even exaggerating.  If it just flashes to me and there's a huge hole in my leg, I'm like, I fell 1,000 feet, guys.  I was hanging by a bridge. 
[02:56:00]  Like, I'm going to elaborate.  He misses everything.  He's like, I fell.  It was probably about 30 feet.  I think I might have hypothermia now.  And my leg's bleeding profusely.  I put a tourniquet on.  Let me explain the tourniquet.  And I'm like, you're awesome.  That's a functional mind.  That's a survivor's mind, you know?  He's really out there, like.  He's like, his concern is not the fact there's a huge hole in his leg, but, all right, how do I solve this problem?  I put this tourniquet on, you know?  Yeah, guys, I'm sorry I didn't have time to light this shot appropriately.  I just had to eat some rocks.  Oh, yeah, it's like, it's not that fun to watch, because you can't even tell what the hell's going on. 
[02:56:30]  You're like, what is he doing?  My face, the camera, just showing his eyes.  About 35 below zero out there.  I'm underneath a piece of tinfoil.  It would be the best if he was, like, shooting in his backyard.  You catch a glimpse of the house.  It's panned out, and there's, like, you know, it's just, like, in the middle of the suburbs in the backyard.  His pool.  Yeah, all right?  That's the debate with those guys.  Yeah, Survivor Man is, like, the fucking, you know, he's the, you know, the rock and roll indie, you know, I'm fucking doing this for real. 
[02:57:00]  Fuck this good-looking Bear Grylls going on Oprah, asshole.  And Bear Grylls is the corporate guy.  Yeah.  The corporate sponsor.  It's like Twister.  They both have something to offer.  It's like the movie Twister, man.  It's not the cool, groovy group.  It's the black SUV guys.  Yeah, exactly.  But the fact is, it's a lot more fun to watch the Bear Grylls show because of the camera, et cetera.  Survivor Man is a guy telling you about cool shit happening. 
[02:57:30]  I can get that anywhere.  You know, it's like a dude walking.  You can see Bear Grylls drink his own piss.  Yeah, you can see Bear Grylls, like, climbing on shit, building a hut, you know?  Yeah.  I just build a house out of my own shit.  Yes.  Sorry.  Sorry, I didn't have time to shoot that.  But where would you go to hide out from people?  Well, I mean, just you got to go somewhere local to where you live, you know?  I live in Vegas, so I just go out to the desert.  I'd say that's now, that's part of the where you live thing. 
[02:58:00]  What if you're in a major metropolis, New York City area?  I want to get the fuck out.  Yeah?  Quickly, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't want to be in a, you know, anything pandemic, disease-wise, loss of,  we start losing antibiotics, et cetera.  Their shit's going to be bad, and we're densely populated.  It's bad.  A lot of disease.  We were talking about Rome, the collapse.  That was part of the problem with it.  Densely population, you know, each other's own feces and vomit, germs, you know?  Sexy. 
[02:58:30]  You don't want to be there.  You want to be out on your own.  You know, animals don't transmit, like, this is dirtier than the middle of the woods.  Because we all transmit the same viruses.  Yeah, well, I mean.  It comes out of everybody's asses.  It comes out of everybody's asses.  Well, hey.  Somebody in this motherfucker's sick.  I want to know who it is.  When these fucking things close, there's no telling how dirty it gets in here, you know?  Yeah, you know, the air.  I don't know.  I don't know how it's filtering through here.  We've been breathing in tuberculosis.  It shoots her. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, but, you know, you've got antibiotics and doctors.  No worries, man.  So, what man-made shit is necessary, though?  Like, where you skip out and go to the woods?  Well, you know, guns.  You take guns, flashlights.  Well, I mean, let's say.  Right.  Night vision goggles.  That's what I'm going to do with some shit.  You know, how long is it going to last?  You got all this shit?  Of course.  Yeah, I do too.  You know, it's like I got bulletproof vests, but they're expired.  They only have, like, a three-year life.  They expire?  Yeah, they do.  How?  Well, they're made out of, they're actually made out of spider webbing, you know? 
[02:59:30]  So, they do expire.  They, they, and also, too, you think you're putting out a warranty on someone's life.  You want to have, after so much wear and tear, you're sweating them, you know?  And then the sweat dries, it degrades the material.  But if you just left one in a box, would it expire?  I don't know.  I don't know the degrading process on them, but it would be expired.  Vacuum sealed.  Like, they wouldn't, they wouldn't, uh, they wouldn't cover you.  That sounds, I mean, right?  I mean, that seems crazy. 
[03:00:00]  I'd rather have an expired one.  Yeah, I'll take my chances.  And not have one at all and get shot.  I'll take my chances.  Yeah.  Well, we, we got to shoot through the expired ones back when I worked as a cop.  We, we shot through the expired ones.  Yeah.  Just to see what would happen.  What happened?  They worked.  That 50 cal shoots through a tank, right?  That's like canvite cows.  They don't really expire.  What, what, five, five, six, two, two, three, all that stuff's going through.  Bulletproof vest isn't meant for, uh, yeah.  It's not, it tells you, you know?  It's meant for some stabbing and, and, uh, handguns, you know?  Yeah, you get, like, a thug fucking pulls his gun out and shoots you. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, it'll stop that.  But, you know, somebody's shooting you from far away.  Fucking mile away, 50 cal round isn't going to, the thing is just going to explode.  Like a bulletproof vest wouldn't be right for a girl, like a real gun, but like that gun  that you have, it would be fine, right?  You could just unload that 40 off.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the, the, the, the fag gun that I have.  My faggot 40 cal.  It's that little picnic gun that you have, that cute little thing.  My pixie stick.  That's what I call it, a pixie stick. 
[03:01:00]  Are you an animal lover?  I'm looking through this.  I mean, I'm not opposed to animals.  No, I mean, like dogs.  Physically, yes.  But you have these cats, though.  You love, you love your cats or whatever.  Yeah, you know, I love them, but, I mean, when it goes down, I'll eat them.  You'll eat, that's what I was going to say.  That's an ultimate food source.  Would you eat your pet?  You would, you would have to, to live, you'd just do it, right?  Eat the shit out of them.  Man, I think I could not, I'd die if I ate my doggie.  Really?  It would be pretty gross.  I would cook at my dog.  And he'd be eating you the second you drop dead.  You know what, though?  Because that's, but I'm better than him.  I can't look at the damn dog, look at me like, are you going to eat me for real? 
[03:01:30]  You don't look at him in the face.  You bash him over the back of the head.  Oh, like a baby seal?  Yes.  Ah, you're just, damn it, no.  Well, you know, anything I kill, I'm going to eat, I'm going to use, you know.  I don't want to kill something just for shit to say.  I hate, like, sport fishermen or sport shooters.  It's just, ah, I got these antlers.  Not only would I eat the dog, I would feed it all my food, get it nice and plump, and  then have a nice dog feast.  Look at these fucking hooves I got.  I just got these antlers. 
[03:02:00]  Like, that's the douche.  Really?  You got some antlers you killed them for?  Everything in between antlers and hooves.  That's it.  Do you hunt or you just shoot paper?  Because I'm not a big hunter.  Shoot a lot of clay.  I don't shoot animals.  I don't like shooting.  If I shoot an animal, and I think I'm going to get into this right now, I don't have a  lot of time, but if I shoot an animal, I'm going to trek out, shoot this motherfucker,  carry it back, skin it, clean it, you know, live off of it, like I said.  Yeah, caveman that motherfucker.  Yeah, I'm not willing to do that right now, because that's a lot of time and effort, and  it's kind of boring. 
[03:02:30]  So, you know, that'll be like a hobby down in the future.  Right now, I like shooting skeet.  Yeah, skeet.  Skeet's fun.  Yeah, it's fun.  That is.  That's pretty rough.  It's hard to miss shit with a 12-yard shotgun.  Yeah.  Makes you feel good.  Unless they're throwing fucking five at a time up there.  Yeah.  See those guys?  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah, well, those guys are, I mean, that's what they do.  Yeah.  Like, I worked out, you know, I trained, I hit miss, whatever.  They just shoot all day.  They just shoot all day, and then they go home, and they load their bullets and jerk  off.  It's a great life.  You're into that, you know?  This is a George Carlin joke, but I'm really posing it as a question. 
[03:03:00]  If you had to kill and eat one of us in here in a pinch, who would you eat first?  Well, I think your big man here would last the longest.  It would be.  Yeah.  It's like.  He knew.  That's why I'm asking, that would be, I think your big man.  He could feed all of us for a little bit.  Yeah, but you knew that.  No.  See, some more white shit.  What the fuck, Sam?  He'd eat the most meat, motherfucker.  How about your cheeks?  It's not white shit.  And you're not as fucking small as you think you are.  Fat, skinny, motherfucker. 
[03:03:30]  I wasn't saying.  You bug me.  I wasn't.  He knew that's what he would.  Of course he would have.  He was hot.  I didn't know.  I didn't know he was going to say.  I didn't know he was going to say.  Of course he would eat me.  You are the most defensive man I've ever met in my life.  If he was going to eat, I'd fucking eat.  Oh, no.  He looks delicious.  He might.  I was waiting to see if he'd go.  He'd go, well, you think it's Patrice.  But actually, Danny, because he's right in between, that's the kind of meat you want.  Sam would be more tender, I think.  Seriously.  I'm curious, dude.  Sam is more tender than you're going to die, though.  Patrice would be a little tough, I think. 
[03:04:00]  He would just marinate me.  That's how it's cooked, yeah.  Sam would be the most resourceful.  I'd eat Sam and then make clothing out of his hair or something.  We'd get use out of Sam's body.  That's good.  I like that.  Yeah.  Hey, there's actually a section in there on how to eat people meat.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I want to wear your skin.  What is that?  Do you know offhand with that?  I am.  Slipping through this book.  What do you got to do?  How do you prepare a human?  Yeah.  It's not that hard, you know?  Same as anything, you know?  Cook it, cook it. 
[03:04:30]  Again, eating human, you got bacteria and stuff.  You know, pork gets a bad rap.  I don't eat pork because it's one of the few things where stuff...  Trichinosis.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it carries...  Well, people meat's just as bad, so you really got to cook the shit out of it.  Yeah?  Now, what about fire?  A little flint stick, or what are you thinking?  I'm hoping the waterproof matches worked out because every time I see them...  Every time I see them, or lighters, or flints, yeah.  Every time I see them making that shit, it looks amazingly difficult. 
[03:05:00]  Like the Boy Scout with the wood and the holy shit.  I was just watching that stupid castaway the other day.  Hour and a half.  I watched Tom Hanks sit there trying to make that fire.  I think that was the best way to...  Oh my God, this poor motherfucker.  Or a quest for fire.  Yeah.  What she did at the end, where she's like, you dumb...  Like the whole...  You see the quest for fire?  Yeah, yeah.  And the whole movie, these guys trying to keep this stupid fire.  And at the end, this bitch is not how to make a fire.  Like, you dumb motherfuckers.  I mean, you got to deal with it.  Yeah.  The flint sticks, where you just crap and crap, you know. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But if you run out, like if you're stuck, though, like what's...  Well, flint's a rock.  It's going to take a while to go anywhere, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, you just fucking...  Yeah, you keep striking it and striking it.  It makes a spark every time.  Yeah, they got like...  It's almost like a metal rod, and you fucking smack it with another thing.  Survival, man.  Yeah.  Got to watch that shit.  Yeah, if I don't have that, I am all kinds of fucked.  And ammunition.  You know, guns without ammo.  How much ammunition can you carry?  I'm hiking.  I'm on my feet, you know.  I'm moving.  So I don't have a tremendous amount of ammo.  Well, it depends on what happens. 
[03:06:00]  Like, Big John's thing was like, he was going to just take ammo and water and carry it,  and then he was just going to kill people and take their food and resources.  That's a good idea.  You know?  So the road...  Yeah, as opposed to like carrying his own stuff and doing it.  He was just going to feed off everybody else.  As you go along.  I was like, man, you just...  That's just evil, all right?  We could do that, I guess.  That's one way to do it.  Shit.  Yeah, because I guess then you could conserve your ammo, and then...  Yeah, you just prey off people.  You know, watch the people. 
[03:06:30]  Let them make fire.  Take their fire.  Damn.  Let them make food.  Take their food, take their will.  Where do you go when you do the...  When you do the...  I don't want to call it hiking.  When you do the survival stuff, where's your favorite place to go?  Well, I used to do it in Stone Mountain, Georgia.  Now I just do it kind of wherever in Vegas.  You know?  Just head out.  We got the damn little desert out there, Death Valley.  Not that far.  Little desert.  Yeah, not that far.  But I mean, out there.  How about scorpion bites and snakes?  Is that all in here covered? 
[03:07:00]  No, it's not.  Hey, you're fucked.  No, you're fucked, yeah.  Yeah.  But seriously, like, here's how dumb I am.  You know, I'm from Georgia, so the terrain's new to me, and I'm like, what are these holes  I keep seeing everywhere?  Oh, yeah, these are snake holes.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah, you gotta watch that.  And you know, the thing is, like, learn the snakes in your area, you know?  So I know the snakes in the desert, and I know the snakes in Georgia.  Everything else, I have no idea.  So you know not to go near, you know, that one.  Yeah, I know, like, what a watermoxin looks like.  You know, I know, like, what a rattlesnake looks like. 
[03:07:30]  Everything else, I'm like, I don't know.  What's an underratedly dangerous animal that people don't know is a fucking, a son of a bitch?  Well, you know, the stupid question is deer.  They kill more people than anybody.  Deer?  Auto accidents, yeah.  Well, I mean, like, if you're in the woods, though, where you go, oh, that's a panda.  I'm gonna fuck that up.  You know, let's see.  Panda.  What those, uh, what the hell, uh, the, uh, the, uh, they, uh, they kill you with the gangrene  and their bite. 
[03:08:00]  What are they?  The, uh, Gila monsters?  Oh, right, yeah.  Because they're so poisonous.  Big lizard-y thing.  Yeah, they bite you and nothing happens.  They just take a chunk of you.  They're happy.  And then you have to die of, like, gangrene and you get poisoned and you basically become  septic and go into shock, you know?  So I think, I think the biggest thing would be bugs and stuff.  You gotta die from some sort of infection that, again, if you had a doctor, easy to fix,  hard to fix out there.  Well, you gotta fucking raid a pharmacy.  Even expired antibiotics don't degrade as fast as they say, you know? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, you gotta raid a pharmacy.  Again, my bulletproof vest and my antibiotics, they're expired, but I'm still using them.  That's why I don't want to go out to the fucking desert or something.  I kind of want to arm up, get around some kind of suburban area where maybe I can hit  a CVS, grab some fucking good drugs, ones that take care of infection, and then ones  that, like, fuck you up a little so at least you don't have to deal with it.  Well, you do it your way, I'll do it mine.  We'll see what makes it.  But correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm just taking all this shit from watching Survivorman and all  that shit.  Hey, don't worry, I am too.  I wrote a book about it. 
[03:09:00]  Like, the environment, the environment will kill you more quickly than anything.  Yeah, learn your surroundings.  Yeah, it's like, you know, I saw some shit on Survivorman where he was hungry, and he  saw a patch of, like, grass in the fucking woods, and he's like, most people would eat  that shit, it will kill you in five minutes flat.  Like, I was like, Jesus Christ.  Fucking grass.  Like, just shit like that, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what the fuck's gonna kill you, man.  I think.  Make that mistake.  Like, yeah, where are you gonna cross, like, a polar bear? 
[03:09:30]  That's gonna, you know.  Or something you know you can eat.  Yeah.  As far as a plant goes, I have no fucking clue.  That's why.  I stick around, I'll go into the grocery stores.  Fucking zombie, bam, you blast them.  Syphilis zombies.  I like how you're basing all this on Zombieland.  That would be great.  Did you like Zombieland?  I thought Zombieland was cool.  Yeah, I enjoy Zombieland.  I like the Bill Murray part a lot.  I thought it was cool.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  I really laugh hard at that shit.  That was funny.  Pretty good fucking movies.  I was gonna kill Bill Murray.  That was good.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Well, Forrest Griffin, he's got a new book out.  Be ready when the shit goes down, a survival guide to the apocalypse.  You guys have fucked me for the rest of the day.  I'm doing this all day, and this is like the only one you can cuss on.  Yeah, you're gonna be screwed now.  You're gonna be throwing out F-bombs.  The book, of course, is in bookstores and Amazon.com.  You got a signing tonight at 7?  I don't know if you can look at that without closing these shades.  Yeah, you're gonna watch it.  I do, if you say so, man.  I don't know.  Nah, that's covered up ass on that thing. 
[03:10:30]  That's pretty nice.  Wow, tonight at the book review in Huntington.  That place gets a lot of people down there.  7 o'clock tonight, and then tomorrow at noon at Borders in Manhattan,  and 7 p.m. tomorrow at bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey.  And go to ForrestGriffin.net for all of your Forrest Griffin information.  Forrest, good luck with the book, and good luck with kicking ass,  and good luck with staying alive during the apocalypse.  All right.  Hopefully we'll bump into each other, you know. 
[03:11:00]  I don't want to bump into you.  You'll kill me and take my supplies.  With my pussy gun?  How am I going to kill you with that faggot weapon?  Exactly.  Thanks a lot, Forrest.  Be right back.  Sit pretty still and listen.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Whoa, damn, rocking.  Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:11:30]  Patrice O'Neill.  And, of course, Joe DeRosa in studio.  Help an ant out.  Get well soon.  Yeah, Opie.  Get well soon.  He's under the weather, as they say.  A little sickly.  He's got that.  You think he's listening, just going, ah.  There's points where he's going, ah, this is the right way they should.  What the fuck is he doing?  This is a good time to, ah.  You know what it's probably like? 
[03:12:00]  You ever see Mommy Dearest when Christina is sick with the appendicitis and she's watching  her mother play her part on the soap opera?  Which is hysterical.  She's trying to play like a 22-year-old and she's all old trying to fucking do the dialogue  with the young guy on the soap opera and she's just slaying in bed like, oh, my God.  Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.  Right where the sun, your mother decided to play your part. 
[03:12:30]  She goes, and she's all groggy.  She goes, but I am a 22-year-old.  How could they not take a call from Jim from Schenectady?  Right now.  That was the time.  You know, there are a lot of Forrest Griffin fans that probably wanted to talk to him.  Oh, shit.  You should have taken a call or two.  Wait, you're right.  You are right, sicko. 
[03:13:00]  Hey, sicko.  You are fucking.  Holy shit balls.  See, that would have been where we took the calls.  As we're trying to fucking.  Oh, hey, Forrest.  And we're trying to fucking statue carve out an interview.  So, Swiss cheese whiz, so how's it get his holes?  Yeah.  So, hope he's like this.  Will you fucking get the Forrest Griffin fans?  Bob from fucking Phoenix.  What a question. 
[03:13:30]  What did you do?  Fuck.  We took no calls for Forrest Griffin.  Fuck the calls.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  He's over at shade 45 now.  Let him take calls over there.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Why you get this motherfucker on here?  Are you the nigga that be up?  Dude.  How would you preserve your pussy during the apocalypse?  It's apocalypse. 
[03:14:00]  What the fuck is that about, bitch?  Oh, Jesus.  Sicko.  You didn't have a good goddamn point.  Sorry about that one.  He should have taken a call.  What are you texting Sam?  Call.  Call.  Sorry, sicko.  He's going to come walking down the hall in a robe with a sweating fever.  All right.  Let me sit down.  Let me just sit here.  Dude.  When fucking Forrest Gump is on the show, you take fucking calls. 
[03:14:30]  Calls.  Bobby's a big fan.  He could have fucking helped out.  Dude, you know, Forrest, let me talk to you about your last match, dude.  Oh, shit.  Because I couldn't tell you what the last match was.  Oh, sicko, man.  I'm not.  You know, we had sicko and no Jimmy.  Sicko had a fucking great point.  You should have taken a call.  Any more good points, sicko?  Anything else we fucked up today?  Oh, we fucked up sicko.  We got a lot of, like, CDs with stories on them that we should probably get to so we 
[03:15:00]  could talk about things.  You know what?  You do got a point, sicko.  What's the CDs, man?  What's the sound?  Dude, I want to hear about Lady Gaga and the Mexican fucking, the wetbacks.  That is a great point.  I forgot about Lady Gaga.  You mentioned that, like, two hours ago.  Oh, I teased it.  I teased it when we fucking came in.  At six.  At six.  It was a tease.  I didn't talk to you about that at 6.30. 
[03:15:30]  We'll be right back with Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  His energy was fully there.  He's like, that fucking cunt.  We're going to talk about this whore.  I was ready to go, but you had to talk about your fucking phone.  No, you had to talk about my phone.  I was ready to let it go.  No.  Fuck it.  Oh, let's talk about Lady Gaga.  She was on stage at some concert in Arizona, right?  Yes.  And she, of all people, has to, because everybody now that even goes to Arizona or flies over  Arizona, whatever, has to talk about the law that is this immigration law, this illegal 
[03:16:00]  immigration law.  And by the way, sorry about that.  Yeah, that's okay.  By the way, there's a hit out on that fucking sheriff.  Yeah, that sheriff out there in Arizona.  He's got a hit with these fucking drug cartel Mexicans.  Jesus Christ, dude.  A drug cartel put a hit on that sheriff, Arapa, or whatever his fucking name is.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like the badass sheriff out there.  They're going to send the hit squad from the end of Scarface to attack his stupid jail 
[03:16:30]  with fences on it.  His fucking tent jail with the...  Doesn't he make the comics look pink and shit?  And no one's going to protect him.  Oh, no.  It'll be a riot.  You know he's scared to death.  He's going to be a tough guy about it, but he's scared to death.  Of course.  He's got to be looking over his shoulder.  I would just fucking go.  I'm out of here.  I'm going to go fucking...  You always think, what are you going to do if something like that happens?  I would leave.  I'd do that.  But you know what?  You wouldn't go anywhere.  It would be safer if he went to Mexico and just hit out.  Just hide out in Cancun.  Just go way south in Mexico where they don't hear about any of this shit. 
[03:17:00]  Like fucking Cabo.  Yeah.  Go with Sammy Hagar.  Exactly.  Drink some tequila.  Exactly.  I love Sammy Hagar.  You watch Sammy Hagar on Cribs.  He's like, this place is great, man.  Just drink tequila up on the floor.  Yeah, Sammy, where you live.  Yeah.  Not in some fucking shithole where the corrupt police department is shaking down everybody.  Yeah, two blocks down, they're slipping people's throats in the street for a bag of M&M's.  Sammy's just like, whoo, he's fucking drinking tequila, having a good old time.  Yeah, man. 
[03:17:30]  Fucking good time.  Matthew McConaughey was just down here.  We partied it up.  There's some bodies being buried out in the middle of the fucking Sonora Desert.  Hey, we almost fucked up again.  Come on.  Let's get to Lady Gaga.  I want to hear her and her wisdom on this Arizona immigration, illegal immigration bill.  I didn't used to be brave.  I wasn't a brave person at all. 
[03:18:00]  But you have made me brave.  And now I'm going to be brave for you.  What is she babbling about?  Tonight, I want you to free yourself.  They're cheering like...  I want you to let go of all of your insecurities. 
[03:18:30]  I want you to reject any person or anything or any law that have ever made you feel like you don't belong.  Show your big clit, you dummy.  Shut up.  She's wearing a fucking hefty bag and trying to be profound.  Does she have a big clit?  Oh, it's giant.  This is what...  The size of a thumb.  You can see he's poking out of panties.  This is for the spirit of all of you. 
[03:19:00]  I dedicate this song.  This is for the love I have for all Mexicans.  This fucking gun has never made a song that had anything to do with anything.  No.  This song is for world peace.  I just want to send out something for the dignity of all Mexican people. 
[03:19:30]  The heart and soul of all mankind.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Shut the fuck up.  That's not your thing.  Any people or any law that looks down on a certain type of paper, this is for you. 
[03:20:00]  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Put your peace signs in the air.  Put them up.  Put them high up in the air.  High up in the air.  Higher.  Yes.  Everyone.  After me.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  I had to talk about the great people that have ever lived. 
[03:20:30]  Jesus Christ, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X.  This is my way of carrying on their message.  This is for you.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  We love you all. 
[03:21:00]  Fuck up.  Just stick to your horse shit.  Exactly.  Stick to your horse shit.  You had a fucking epiphany one day, but won't write a song that would dip her sails.  She won't write an actual fucking peace song.  No.  She's going to sing that horse shit and say it at the fucking, this is, I love people.  And then, man.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:21:30]  Hold on.  I guess.  Hold on.  There have been so many great teachings in the world.  The Bible.  The Koran.  The Torah.  When people make other people do things that they don't want to do, this country was built  for everyone, right?  Woo!  This is for everyone who died making this country what it is.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo. 
[03:22:00]  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Don't you fear the tears?  Fucking AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS is killing Africans at an alarming rate.  It needs to be talked about.  This is for the little African children dying of AIDS.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo. 
[03:22:30]  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  It's like the fuck with the guys that make that song.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And we love all the children.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Shut the fuck up.  This is for the immigrants trying to get into Arizona.  What is love?  Baby, don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:23:00]  The target.  Do y'all have that?  What is life?  I like to say, when I see a child suffering from hunger, it makes me think of the Tarzan song.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know, there are so many people suffering political crimes around the world. 
[03:23:30]  People in China cannot practice religion freely because of an oppressive government.  And this is for those people held in prisons around the world.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, Jesus.  That song sucks a dick. 
[03:24:00]  I am sick of discrimination.  I am sick of hunger.  I am sick of mental slavery.  This song goes out to all of you being oppressed.  Don't want no short dick, man.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  This is for everybody running towards freedom. 
[03:24:30]  Come on, Arlene.  I love children.  99 lost balloons.  Everybody's in the booth.  How about that?  What's to say?  We've got to stop cancer.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God, bitch, shut the fuck.  Please shut the fuck up.  Pancreatic cancer takes many people's lives, and there really isn't a cure.  Um, bop, bop, bop, um, bop.  Ah, ooh, who's that one?  Oh, my piece of shit, my mistake.  My mom's farting.  Fucked up the whole bit.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, that's funny. 
[03:25:30]  Just go over all these shitty songs.  Intestinal problems.  These people making shitty songs, but they have a, after they make all the money making  their shitty songs, and then all of a sudden, like, fucking, I love the kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck, I love the shit.  Oh, they love them.  Oh, my God.  Would you eat fucking rotten beans?  I know, dude.  Holy shit, he ate a cat.  Bobby Kelly just texted me.  I am fucking dying laughing listening to this Gaga shit.  I love that.  Fucking dumb laugh. 
[03:26:00]  What's the actual song, though?  We have the song?  I don't even know why I have it.  I don't even know why I know that shit.  I know it's a shitty song.  This is for the Mexicans being persecuted.  I added a verse for you, Mexico.  Hola. 
[03:26:30]  Hola.  Gracias for your pain.  Mexicans, stay along.  You can't understand me.  But fuck it.  Just come along.  She has nothing to do with politics.  Shut the fuck up.  Does this sound like somebody that fucking has pain?  No.  This is party song.  Fucking.  All right, well, keep that queued up.  Yeah.  Keep that queued up.  We might need it.  We have another quote here by Lady Gaga.  She starts really getting into it. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, well, they were going bullshit with our first little quote there.  So why is she going to lay off?  Here's Lady Gaga.  I got a phone call from a couple of really big rock and rollers, big pop stars, big rappers.  And they said, we'd like you to boycott Arizona.  We'd like you to boycott playing Arizona because of SB 1070. 
[03:27:30]  You know what the planet the aliens are from?  That's Subtan Rousin, isn't it?  Yeah.  And I said, you really think that us dumb fucking pop stars are going to collapse the economy of Arizona?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I'll tell you what we have to do about SB 1070. 
[03:28:00]  We have to be active.  That'll be 426.  And the nature of the monster ball is to actively protest prejudice and injustice and the bullshit that is put on our society as a youth because you're a superstar no matter who you are or where you come from.  And you were born that way. 
[03:28:30]  Hit the music.  Yeah.  And now.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  This is the song of freedom.  Yeah.  Here she goes.  Everybody's going to be fucking at the Arizona Statehouse with this song playing a fist in the air.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's what fucking slaves need.  We need a fucking Lady Gaga.  Yeah.  That'll finally get everything in perspective. 
[03:29:00]  And everybody will go, yeah, Lady Gaga is right.  I say rah, rah, rah, blah, blah.  I don't give a shit if you're a famous musician and have an opinion about something.  It's like you can't be that kind of famous.  No.  It's just annoying.  She's the wrong kind of famous.  Yeah, it's like Bono.  That's Bono's game.  That's Bono's whole thing.  He started doing it right from the beginning.  Everything was political about war and fucking this and that.  She's fucking rah, ma, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:29:30]  And then out of nowhere, she pulls this Mexican shit.  Give me a break.  Come on.  Ramen noodles song.  Ramen noodles.  Ramen noodles.  Ramen noodles.  Chicken shrimp and rot.  Beef, bro.  I stay at Ramada Inn.  Ramada Inn.  Too much sodium.  Celebrate Ramadan.  Where's my bubble gum? 
[03:30:00]  I have a Ram pickup truck.  Tommy Tom Tom Tom.  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.  Oh.  Oh.  Ram, ram, ram and speed.  Oh.  She stinks.  Wow.  And it's like, look, you can, like you said, Joe, you can have your, it's just, that's  not your game.  No.  She's out of place doing this.  She said, you know, she did, she just said fucking, she had this thing, she talked to 
[03:30:30]  a man and she said, I'm tired of, I'm tired of all this.  I'm tired.  Because she, she's known for having like a $15,000 purse.  But, but this is, this is her dichotomy, whatever, her, her duality.  She bought, she has a $15,000 purse, but she'll write some, some shit on it and go, see what  I think about.  It's all bullshit, man.  It's the society.  So why not buy a $2 purse and give away $14,800?  Yeah.  To some Mexicans. 
[03:31:00]  Like, shut the fuck up.  You know what else, too?  It's like, I'll give the average U2 concert goer the benefit of the doubt that he's coherent,  whatever.  It's like a Lady Gaga show.  Everybody is shit-faced.  And nobody.  Everybody is shit-faced.  Nobody there.  Poppers and E and fucking.  What she was saying.  What the fuck.  Did not garner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't care.  Oh my God, Lady Gaga is saying something we should be listening to.  Everyone shut up.  Yeah.  It's not like, you know what she was saying? 
[03:31:30]  Her next hit song.  Yeah.  Her next hit song was coming out of her fucking mind just now, where she's telling the people  and people are like, yeah, fucking yeah.  You can't have the same attitude when you're talking about children dying and then you're  the la, la, la, la shit comes out.  Rah, rah, exit, rah.  Mix, mix, Mexicans.  This song's for you.  Oh my God.  Well, it's not over yet, kids. 
[03:32:00]  No, can't be.  There's another.  There's more Lady Gaga.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I will not cancel my show.  I will yell and I will scream louder and I will hold you and we will hold each other and  we will peaceably protest this state.  Do not be afraid because if it wasn't for all of you immigrants, this country wouldn't 
[03:32:30]  have shit.  And, and I'll be leaving and you'll be staying.  I mean, it's so deeply in my soul.  So deeply in our soul.  Rah, rah, golly, ma.  Rah, rah, golly, ma.  Oh, Shatidee.  Shatidee.  Yeah.  That's a great. 
[03:33:00]  Now let's all dance.  Keep the fight up.  I'll be on a private jet to a better place at about 12 o'clock.  Goodbye.  She's trying to do that Morpheus shit from Matrix Reloaded.  Tonight we dance for freedom, freedom, rah, rah. 
[03:33:30]  That's a good point.  She's leaving.  She came in.  She's like, look, I'm just going to take a big shit on the floor right now.  I'm going to get everybody all worked up and then I'm fucking gone.  I'm out of here.  We're going to have a peaceful protest.  You better because when I leave, they're going to beat the shit out of all you Mexicans  who I gave false hope to.  By the way, Kurt loves it.  Popeye Gaga.  Rah, rah, ah, gah, gah.  Rah, rah, ah, gah, gah.  Rah, rah, ah, gah, gah, gah, gah. 
[03:34:00]  Rah, rah, ah, gah, gah.  Oh, you scoyle, gahle.  Rah, ah, gah, gah, gah.  Oh, shit.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Holy shit.  Popeye Gaga.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Brutus.  Ah, gah, gah.  Yeah, that's gah, gah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh.  It's just Lady Gaga.  Look, look, have your opinion. 
[03:34:30]  I don't.  Yeah, yeah, it's fine.  But too much passion to what she's saying.  A chick like that, what she's going to do, that's going to be like, hey, guys, you know,  at least acknowledge.  This is the thing about taking yourself seriously.  You have to acknowledge your horse shit first.  Like, she has to go, look, I got a bunch of shitty songs.  You know we crazy.  But guys, hey, think about what the Latinos are going through, Hispanics, man.  They're going through a lot here.  But let's party.  Oh, sorry.  Let's party and have a good time.  And, you know, just remember. 
[03:35:00]  That would be, you could still goof on it, but it wouldn't be as bad as this.  It just wouldn't, like, where she just stopped and let everyone stop.  Because at that point, she had to be singing.  I wish we had clips of the song that just played.  Of, yeah, what she just came out of.  And then the song she went into after that fucking speech.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  We need to hold each other as a society and come together.  Because this fucking asshole shit that is. 
[03:35:30]  Well, yeah, and I love, too, that she's sitting there going, going, all of you being oppressed.  All of you what?  You mean all the immigrants that can't afford to get into your fucking show?  Exactly.  Not exactly there tonight.  They are all kids and gay men.  All the oppressed who can't afford this $80 ticket.  Yeah.  In the back.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, why don't you go back and do a protest and a rally and broad fucking dance?  She'll never do that because it's too dangerous.  Free concert.  Right on the border.  Free concert.  We're donating everything we make off of fucking snacks or whatever. 
[03:36:00]  To fight this bill.  Yeah, right.  I cut a third of my pyrotechnics today so we could afford to give out free hot dogs.  Because people would accept if she was like, look, I'm full of shit.  I'm a pop star.  And, you know, look, this is not my game.  But I'm just, you know, I feel bad for that shit.  Yeah.  I feel bad for the situation.  And then, boom.  It's probably on YouTube, but she went into a song called Boys, Boys, Boys.  Oh, yeah.  Which song is that one? 
[03:36:30]  It's not a single, so it's probably not in the system.  Oh.  But I'm sure it'll be in the system.  I think every Lady Gaga song would be in the system.  Jesus.  So Boys, Boys, Boys was the next one right after fucking.  Yeah, she brings out a bunch of guys in a little underwear and dances with them.  Oh, after the speech?  Yeah.  Are they Mexican?  No.  Oh, no.  Boys, Boys, Boys.  Oh, that's Boys, Boys, Boys.  Big production number. 
[03:37:00]  I'm not feeling the love for the Mexicans.  Come on.  Oh.  Oh.  What a pile of shit.  She should never talk about anything serious. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  I'm here to fight for you Mexicans because I can relate to you.  By the way, one of my sets is nicer than your house.  Your whole village.  Yeah.  Look at that shit.  I tell all my Mexican employees, fight.  Yes.  First, I say, go get me a coffee.  Then I tell them I'm with you.  Then I say.  When my maid is making up my bed and then right after, when she's making up my bed and pedicure  on my feet at the same time, I tell her, fight. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  You, look at me.  Look at me, Maria.  Fight.  Yes.  This is a fight song for you Mexicans.  When I make her clean my bathroom child with a toothbrush, and I'm actually standing on  her back while I'm telling her to do it, I'm saying, hey, you fight.  Hey, Conchita, could you clean up your rah, rah, rice and beans? 
[03:38:30]  Right.  When I threaten to turn her into immigration, when she doesn't wash the dishes correctly,  I tell her, look at me.  Don't just let me abuse you.  You go out there and you fight hard.  Yeah.  Fight.  Conchita, I'm denying your request for a raise, but very good.  You're learning to get a little backbone and learning to fight for things that you believe  in.  She's a lump of shit.  And now these sissies are fucking each other in the butt on stage.  Yeah, yeah.  Right after Save the Mexicans.  Fuck you.  You can't show your tits at Yankee Stadium and then expect people to fucking lit. 
[03:39:00]  You just can't.  Yeah.  You fucking can't.  You can't.  You're either dignified or you're not.  It has to be a style of fucking.  It's not her.  You just say, look, you can have a human opinion and you go, man, but you have to be honest  with yourself.  I do a lot of horse shit.  None of my shit is connected to earth.  I have no songs about this, but I am human.  And I, and I, and hey, guys, do, do your best. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  And then go into boys, boys, boys.  Boys, boys, boys.  Do you play this on your show?  On hits one?  No, because it's not a single.  Oh.  Well, fuck me running.  It will be, though.  It could be.  This is a single.  This is a hit song.  The whole album is full of hit songs.  I'm bopping to it.  It's a great song.  I can't stand her.  The whole album is full of great songs.  Whatever.  Rah, rah.  It's just my favorite.  Look, I'm not into horse shit hanging out for extracurricular activities. 
[03:40:00]  I have to, I actually have stuff to do today.  I, um, I have to go get my her did and, uh, go to the hotel and shower.  Your hair did, like how?  I gotta get my her did.  I gotta get a haircut really bad.  I got a fucking mullet grown out of the back of this goddamn thing.  How's, uh, that other thing going?  Oh, that's fine.  Yeah, that's good.  I got greasy convict hair because I didn't shower.  I got a shower at the, uh.  But, uh, you're back to, uh.  Yeah, it's fucking.  You're back to, like, 25-year-old aunt now?  Oh, my God.
