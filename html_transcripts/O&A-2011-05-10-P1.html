<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about Chaz Bono's appearance on Oprah, focusing on crude and graphic descriptions of Bono's physical appearance post-gender reassignment surgery.  The hosts engaged in vulgar jokes and anatomical speculation, also discussing Bono's lesbian girlfriend and the complexities of their relationship.  The conversation then shifted to Oprah's retirement and OWN, with speculation about her future plans. A caller provided a detailed, graphic description of penile reconstruction surgery, prompting further vulgar commentary from the hosts. The show then moved to a comparison of watching TV shows weekly versus in marathons, briefly mentioning past interviews with *The Wire* cast members and referencing Larry King as a "friend of the show."  Numerous callers contributed to the chaotic and irreverent tone.

The next segment began with a discussion of an intern's coffee run, followed by a preview of an upcoming contest winner announcement and the mention of an upcoming interview with a face transplant recipient. The hosts recounted their recent interview with Larry King, highlighting his anecdotes about Jimmy Hoffa, Frank Sinatra, Don Rickles, and Lenny Bruce.  A conflict arose over a producer, Sam, using a clip of Larry King for his own show without permission. Patrice O'Neal then joined the show.  The conversation transitioned to O'Neal's career, stand-up special, and perceived struggles for fame in Los Angeles. He graphically discussed his struggles with diabetes.  The hosts then offered highly opinionated and offensive commentary on basketball, including the Celtics, Heat, and several players, with crude speculation about Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, and LeBron James's personal lives and family. The segment concluded with extensive, explicit conspiracy theories surrounding Osama Bin Laden's death, with O'Neal contributing alternative news-sourced speculation and offensive commentary about political figures and broader political and economic conspiracies.

The following segment featured Patrice O'Neal, Laszlo (promoting *L.A. Noire*), and Matt Paxton (*Hoarders*) in studio.  The discussion included O'Neal's unconventional views on supporting troops, opinions on Louis Farrakhan and Alex Jones, and skepticism about the official narrative of Bin Laden's death, expressing a belief in government manipulation of public perception. Laszlo demonstrated *L.A. Noire* gameplay, with discussion of the game's mechanics and development challenges. A Rockstar Games employee also participated.  O'Neal recounted an uncomfortable experience at a comedy show and a recent conflict with Fez from the Ron and Fez radio show. Matt Paxton discussed his work on *Hoarders*, detailing extreme conditions, psychological aspects of hoarding, and shared graphic anecdotes about disturbing finds, including child pornography.

A subsequent segment focused on Matt Paxton's work with hoarders, including graphic descriptions of squalor and disturbing finds,  mentioning the discovery of valuable items like money and a Michael Jackson album.  He discussed the psychological aspects of hoarding and the challenges of helping hoarders.  Warren Haynes then joined the show.  The hosts and Haynes discussed his career (Allman Brothers Band, Gov't Mule), his new album "Man in Motion," and his touring schedule.  A humorous exchange occurred regarding their differing musical knowledge.  Haynes performed "River's Gonna Rise" and "Sick of My Shadow" live.  The conversation also touched upon the blues and other genres.

The final segment featured Patrice O'Neal performing a bluesy, spoken-word rendition of "Going Down Slow," boasting about his lifestyle.  Warren Haynes was present promoting his new CD and upcoming shows.  Laszlo briefly promoted *L.A. Noire*. The hosts thanked their guests and concluded the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  Good morning.  Hold, please. 
[00:01:30]  All right.  All right, all right, all right.  Man, I got beat up yesterday.  What happened?  I just tweeted.  I went, hey, anyone else watching Chaz Bono on Oprah?  All right, but that's kind of a thing like, all right, the Oprah thing, people will goof on you.  But the Chaz Bono part of it's hysterical.  But most people don't know why that's hysterical. 
[00:02:00]  See, if I described it better in my tweet, I think I would have saved myself.  You only have so many characters, though.  I think I was called gay probably 387 times before I had to turn off my Twitter.  Yeah.  Because everyone is so original, by the way.  Oh, I know.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Yeah, they love jumping on the bandwagon.  Gay. 
[00:02:30]  It's like, didn't you read the other ones that said gay, like the 50 other ones that said gay?  I don't even care.  I'm just making fun.  I deserve it.  I know that.  But over and over again.  Who is that gay?  Instead of maybe opening your mind and then turning it on and realizing, holy shit, you get to see a nice freak show in the year 2011.  Total freak show.  Total freak show.  Yeah.  This, wow.  This Chaz Bono.  Wow, man.  All man, right? 
[00:03:00]  Look, I try to have an open mind about things now that I'm a little older.  Yeah.  But man, that change in gender shit, I think that's where my line is.  That's just fucked up.  It really is an odd thing, especially with a celebrity like that.  Just imagine you wake up one day and realize you need your penis off you.  Yeah.  Seriously, think that through.  Oh, I don't want that thing on me.  Just get rid of it.  Wouldn't that be just the scariest thing ever?  How do you know you're making the right decision? 
[00:03:30]  And once you make it, that's pretty much it.  And for the women, also, it's like, yeah, get rid of these mounds of flesh off my chest.  I don't want these breasts to seize.  I just can't imagine that.  And then taking your genitals and then making it into something else.  How do they do that with a woman, though?  I don't know.  Very hard to make a schlong out of a vagina.  But you can make a vagina out of a schlong.  They figured that one out.  Right.  But the brown, I don't think they figured that out.  Not really.  I'm going to have to watch Own tonight because I'm gay, still gay, gay, gay. 
[00:04:00]  Because the documentary's on tonight.  Yeah.  The Oprah thing yesterday was just a tease.  And they showed just a couple clips from this documentary.  I think it's going to be a doozy.  Yeah, a lulu.  A lulu.  Because at one point during this thing yesterday, they showed Chaz Bono at her home, at his home, at whatever's home.  It's home.  Yeah, and because you want to say it's still a she, but yeah, look, she's wearing a Michigan shirt like a guy would wear, like Tank would wear. 
[00:04:30]  The tats.  He's got, he, she's got tats now, like guy tattoos.  And leg hair.  Leg hair.  Yeah, yeah, that's a leg hair.  Yeah, but when he, I don't even know how to do this.  He, she walked out of an Oprah yesterday.  Big pork chop sideburns?  Ah, conservative, but long enough to know that they're male sideburns. 
[00:05:00]  Really?  Yes.  And you, if you're old enough, like we are, you remember when, when this was just this cute little blonde on TV?  Ah, adorable little kid on, uh.  Probably the cutest.  Sonny and Cher show.  One of the cutest kids to ever be on TV.  Oh, yeah.  America ate this little girl up, and now look what, you would, you would lose a lot of money if someone said, you know, remember that little girl from Sonny and Cher?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  You'd say, no way.  It has dark hair. 
[00:05:30]  It's kind of a crew cut.  Spiky kind of, uh, haircut.  And just manly.  Very manly.  How much facial hair, besides the pork chop sideburns, was it, uh, could you see any, uh, five o'clock shadow, any Fred Flintstone going on there?  You could tell that she, he, uh, just learned how to shave.  Oh, really?  It looked like the skin was, like, kind of.  A little rough?  A little rough, like, you know, it seemed a little too much razor.  Needs one of those, uh, nice, uh, five-blade razors with the aloe strip on it or something. 
[00:06:00]  It looked like at any time there was going to be nicks and cuts that were going to start bleeding.  That's a good one.  Looks like, uh, who said that?  Looks like John Candy.  A little bit.  A little John Candy.  A little John Candy.  We got Ralphie Mae yesterday.  Some Ralphie Mae.  Ralphie Mae might be the number one person that Chaz Bono now looks like.  Ah!  All right.  But, uh, they had a little piece of the documentary where she, I guess, because at this point it 
[00:06:30]  was still a she, had her breasts removed.  Yeah.  And then she was looking at her manned breasts for the first time.  Oh.  And they looked like a fat guy's...  Baloney tits?  Fat guy's chest.  With fat guy nipples.  Were they big nipples?  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, a chick with tits will have big nipples.  But the nipples looked, uh, manly.  And then they showed her at home, like, uh, I just woke up. 
[00:07:00]  And he's, now it's a he, I guess.  Yeah.  He's in the kitchen.  Ugh!  Ugh!  With no shirt on because he's a man.  And I'm thinking that's got to be illegal.  Because Chaz Bono was born a female.  A woman.  So, I wonder if they were showing, like, a topless broad on TV yesterday.  So, were you seeing tits?  Was it hot?  They didn't cube it out.  No, it was a guy's chest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With guy nipples.  Pretty bad. 
[00:07:30]  Dude, it was weird.  I don't know, man.  I don't know what to say about this.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  Yeah.  He didn't have, like, baloney tits.  No?  No.  Just kind of a regular man's chest.  And then he's got this hot-looking girlfriend.  And now she's really confused.  No way.  Because she's a lesbian.  He, she was a lesbian.  But always knew she needed to be a man.  It gets so confusing. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  But she was definitely a lesbian.  Still a lesbian.  And now her lover is a guy.  So she's confused as all hell.  That makes no sense.  But she doesn't want to leave him.  But she doesn't like guys.  And he wants to be a guy all the way.  Like, he doesn't want to fool around in the middle here.  Right, right.  Chaz Bono wants to be a guy.  That's the most fucked up mental thing.  So what happens to the girlfriend?  Who likes girls? 
[00:08:30]  The girlfriend who likes girls.  Because he now acts like a guy.  So the girlfriend wants guys?  No.  Vagina?  The girlfriend is a lesbian.  That's how they got together.  And she didn't have these fucked up thoughts in her head.  That she always knew who she was.  She was a lesbian.  Right.  Chaz Bono fucked up thoughts in the head.  Lesbian.  But also realized needed to be a guy. 
[00:09:00]  Are you following me?  Yeah, yeah.  So now the girl that didn't have the fucked up thoughts in that way in her head.  Is now with a guy.  But she's a lesbian.  But she fell in love with him.  And the guy that you're in love with has a vagina.  For now.  For now.  I think he's trying to figure out how to get a penis.  Because he wants a penis.  He wants to be.  Wants a penis.  He wants to be all in guy.  Wants a penis.  Wants a penis.  Yeah.  No breasts anymore.  Needs a penis.  Needs a penis. 
[00:09:30]  And wants to use it.  How do you build that?  I don't know, man.  Because I have heard about, you know, the guy turning to the girl, which is easier.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  How do you build a penis when there's nothing there?  You got to take like that sliver from the leg and, you know, wrap it around something.  Yeah.  Grab a bone from your...  Maybe there's a harvest area somewhere.  Is there a harvest area like there is for follicles where you can harvest a penis?  Well, I know like when you have like a heart attack, sometimes they have to harvest some veins from your leg. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do bypass it.  I'm thinking maybe they harvest maybe your upper thigh.  I'm thinking they take a slice of your upper thigh, right?  And they roll it like a tube steak.  And then they kind of stick it where like...  And then they pop the clit on top of it so you have some kind of feeling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They got to take the clit off but leave the nerves connected.  Right.  And stretch it to the end of the tube steak they just made.  Where would you put your clit on your... 
[00:10:30]  That's Frankencock.  Where would you put the clit on your new cock?  I would put it...  Imagine we're chicks now.  Right under the fake head.  Right under the fake head would be the perfect place?  It's got to be there on that sensitive area.  Let me think where I would put my clit on my new dick.  You can't put it on the tip of your dick.  That's just weird.  No, no, no.  That's silly.  I guess the underside.  I think you're right.  Yeah, it's got to go on that underside.  You know what's disgusting?  We all had the same answer in like two seconds.  We all knew where we wanted our clits to be.  Yeah.  You got to put it right under the head on the underside. 
[00:11:00]  Because the mushroom is pretty useless in general, but underneath there, wow, there's  some nice sensitive feelings, right?  We all know that.  So I would stretch my old clit and try to make it wrap around my new dick under my helmet.  Like you don't want it like on the shaft right by your balls.  No.  That's the dumbest place for your new clit.  It really is.  Sensitivity nerve area.  Your balls would flip up and hit it.  And you're constantly like being turned on when your balls are moving. 
[00:11:30]  Or would you stretch out your old clit and make it go from ball bag all the way up to  head in the front?  The hole underside?  That's a lot of real estate to cover with a little bit of clit meat.  Maybe the top.  I'm trying to figure out how big my clit would be.  Maybe you could get more leverage out of it if you butterfly it.  Yeah, yeah.  You need to like, yeah, you need to butterfly it, stretch it out.  Because if you don't have your old clit on your new dick, what use is that? 
[00:12:00]  If you're not getting any feeling going on.  So that's what they got to do.  I wonder if they do that.  I think they do, though.  What?  I think they do take some kind of a clit nerve thing and put it on the end.  And you're not going to have a big dick.  Why not?  Because I don't think they could get that much.  What is that?  Is that like a fake dick?  No, I think those are just really big clits.  Ew, that's a cock right there.  That looks like a dog dick. 
[00:12:30]  If Jimmy was here, he would be all over that.  What's wrong with you guys?  I love that.  Oh, nice big clit.  Looks like a dog dick.  What are those two guys that just fucking infantile-ism?  That's sad.  Hey, let's say hi to Larry King, who's now a friend of the show.  Oh, look at that, Larry.  Larry!  Thanks for having me on here today, boys.  No problem, Larry.  Yes.  How important is the stretching of the clit, though? 
[00:13:00]  I think it's very important, Larry.  To stretch it out as big as possible.  Yeah, to put on your new dick.  Put my clit on my new dick is my new username.  Thanks, sir.  But that's why I watched the Oprah yesterday, though.  It's a freak show.  Who doesn't want to see this shit?  Where were the...  Okay, this guy might know.  He's just a dude from Canada, but I think he knows how to make a fucking penis for a woman. 
[00:13:30]  Jason, go ahead.  Jason.  How about Gary?  All right, Gary sounds good.  Whatever.  That's pretty close.  Troy's getting closer.  Gary is Jason.  That's not bad.  All right, what's up, Gary?  I was watching some show on TV the other night.  My old lady and I were laying in bed watching this stupid show.  Anyway, there was a girl on there who had the same sort of thing going on as Chaz does.  And they went into a pretty good detailed explanation.  I'll try to make it semi-brief for the radio. 
[00:14:00]  They take some skin.  They harvest it off of the body someplace.  And they basically roll it in a tube around some sort of a hydraulic type of hand pump.  Oh, no.  A hand pump.  And the person or their significant other can basically decide how long the penis is going to be,  like by how long the tube is on this hand pump unit.  Okay, and then they roll the skin from the harvest area around this pump, this tube. 
[00:14:30]  And they take it off of the clit.  And they put that down below where the helmet's supposed to be, I guess.  Ah, see?  We knew that.  We knew that.  We knew where it should go.  And that becomes a sensitive part.  And then they attach it, and you're feeling kind of frisky.  You get in the mood.  You pump on this hand pump, not on like a, I guess like the pump on a Nike Airship.  A shoe or some fucking thing.  And there you go.  You got a ride.  And you go to town.  So you pump up your new dick. 
[00:15:00]  You got to pump your dick up.  That has your old clit.  Pump my dick up.  Pump, pump.  Pump my dick up.  I would take my old clit and make believe I'm making cookies and really just fucking stretch  it out.  Because it is key.  And then maybe you can make it your entire helmet.  It is key to have like the biggest clit area to use.  Penis pump.  Guy using a penis pump.  And it is.  It's like from the 1800s.  All right.  Is that the first known penis pump? 
[00:15:30]  It looks like it.  I don't know, but it says figure 378, and the instructions are in German.  So it's the best picture I've ever seen in my life.  That's right before you stick it in a chicken.  People are confused.  There's no confusion here.  No, not at all.  We got a couple clips from the Oprah thing.  Oprah.  Yeah, why not?  Let's do this.  When is she ending her show, for fuck's sake, already?  Any day, I think.  Really?  I think this, the end of this month, maybe?  It's going on and on.  I think only a couple weeks left.  I saw some clips from an interview she did, and she seemed a little, she was second-guessing 
[00:16:00]  herself doing this whole project before she was actually off the air.  Yeah.  She thought it might have been good to just continue, go off the air, and then come on  her own network, own, as a new kind of Oprah show.  Right.  But this transition between the two is confusing people, I think.  Right.  And they don't know where to find, own, and stuff, so she's kind of second-guessing her  strategy there.  I think she's going to end up doing a show. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, she's got to.  She can't stay off fucking TV.  It's her own network.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you do a show for your own network?  What else is she going to do?  Produce, I guess.  She seems to be a bore, so I don't think she's going to enjoy her life if she's not doing  TV.  You saw that on the behind the scenes, does she come off as like a bore that shows everything  to her?  Yeah.  She doesn't know how to have fun unless she's doing the show.  No, she was camping or something with Gail.  Of course.  And she says they're just friends.  Yeah, of course they are.  She's actually tackled that question on her own show. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, that's what she says.  Sure.  And they wanted to film her on a horse with Gail.  So just imagine you have a reality show, Anne.  Yeah.  And they or you decide, all right, we're going to go camping, whatever, and I want to get  you on a horse, maybe doing some horseback riding into the countryside.  Sure.  Wouldn't you want to do that because it's just cool to do?  Yeah.  She's like, why do I have to do that?  Well, can't you just film me going away and then just coming back and not film in between? 
[00:17:30]  And that's when I realized that this woman doesn't know how to have a good time when  she's not doing her TV show.  No, just ride.  She was bitching about it.  It's like, well, you agreed to go on the camping trip and it's a big hassle for you.  Why?  They're filming it for a reality show.  And now you're on a horse, I mean, you know, during a beautiful day and you don't even want  to, you know, do the entire thing.  Are you sure the horse wasn't complaining?  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe that was it.  Oh, can we just film this with her going and then when we come back real quick, get 
[00:18:00]  her off my fucking back?  I think she just doesn't really know how to enjoy herself when she's not doing that TV  show.  Yeah.  Which makes me think that within a year you'll see her talk show right back on own.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  She comes off like somebody that's, that's her whole life.  Yeah.  Like without it, she's kind of just nothing.  She's just there.  Uh, Chaz Bone on Oprah.  Chaz talks about being uncomfortable growing up as a girl.  Oh yeah.  You never felt comfortable in your own body.  You never did.  Right. 
[00:18:30]  I mean, when I was really little, it was very clear to me that I felt like a boy and my friends  were all boys.  And then as I got older and especially going into puberty, it felt like the expectations  around me started to change of how I was supposed to act.  But it also felt as if my body was like literally betraying me because I, I went from a very  athletic, you know, straight up and down little kid to a very curvaceous woman.  And it was just horrifying to me.  The boobs threw you off. 
[00:19:00]  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you talk to almost any transgender person, it is, it's just a horrible time because you  have this image of yourself and all of a sudden your body just does exactly the opposite of how you feel.  And it's just like, Oh my God, what's happening?  Is this transgender shit made up?  I don't know what to make of it.  I don't either, man.  Like I said earlier, this, this is my line.  I don't get this whatsoever.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  It, uh, I don't know.  It comes off like, uh, you can't quite close the deal.  Like that didn't sound like a man.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, Chaz.  Yeah.  Uh, still going through some of the treatments.  That didn't sound like, uh, I sound like a girl either though.  It's kind of that in between.  No, it's that in between weird kind of thing where you're not quite a man.  Or a woman.  I don't know.  He's supposed to take hormones and isn't that supposed to keep in the voice down there  or something?  Yeah.  Didn't work for her. 
[00:20:00]  Well, it's still early on.  Is it?  Um, well, she's been going through it for 16 months.  I think that's still early.  Oh yeah.  That's still early.  You need a little more time to get that voice.  You should have jumped on that sooner.  Yeah.  I know.  Hormones.  Now she's a middle-aged dude that looks like a trucker.  That's amazing what the fucking people will do.  But you throw up.  That's what she used to look like right there.  Which one?  On the upper right, kind of.  Yeah.  That's when she just started to get fat.  Right, right.  Started to get fat.  Now that just looks like kind of starting to get fat, but that's a chick. 
[00:20:30]  Absolutely.  And then you look at the other face and that's very manly.  Like, the hormones have definitely taken their toll.  And she's got those Gary Shandling lips.  Yes!  Those fucking Gary Shandling lips.  God, you nailed it.  I don't know what that's all about.  There was something about her.  I'm like, why does that look familiar?  You nailed it.  Yeah.  What is it with Gary Shandling lips?  It's the exact lips of Gary Shandling.  I don't understand.  What happened?  So she hated her breasts and everything. 
[00:21:00]  What are those lips?  Like, how would you describe Gary Shandling's lips that they are the Gary Shandling lips?  I mean, they're pursed, right?  They're almost pursed, but they spread out too far.  Yeah.  But they're not fat.  They're like flat and big.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know how you would describe that because not many people have those type of lips.  No, no, but you know it when you see it.  Right.  They look overly moist.  Face pressed against the window lips.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:21:30]  That's Pat from Monocchio.  That's a good one.  It's like you press your lips against the window.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  Is that young chastity bono before the Chaz thing?  Well, that's when Mommy said, keep your fucking weight off.  We want to make you a little singing star.  Long blonde hair and just she's smiling.  But behind that smile, hatred of the tits and the vagina.  Yeah, she would just punch her own tits every night.  Imagine her just bunching her tits in a mirror and giving uppercuts to her vagina. 
[00:22:00]  Because that's the only punch you could really give your vagina is an uppercut.  An uppercunt.  She probably had to have fantasies of being a man when she looked like that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure at some point she probably went to the porno store and got a strap on or whatever  and just probably put it on over jeans or something.  Or under jeans, rather.  And then walked around like she had a cock.  Well, that's the stuff we would ask.  Yeah, yeah.  Not this softball shit. 
[00:22:30]  No.  The stuff people really want to know.  I want to know that.  I want to know if Chaz Bono walked around with a fake dinner pass.  A fake cock just to, you know, get the feeling.  And would she, how come, even though it's her own body, when she was like skinny and shit,  did she look at herself and think like, oh, I'd like to fuck me?  Like, what is that?  Or was she despising her body so much?  She was despising her body, according to her interview yesterday. 
[00:23:00]  Wow.  I don't get this one at all.  No, it's just.  I don't get it.  It's just such an odd thing.  But, I mean, in a way she convinced me yesterday that she just knew she wanted to be a guy, so.  Yeah.  Man, I.  Chaz talks about going from lesbian to transgender.  Transgender.  This may be confusing because when Chaz was chastity, he famously came out as a lesbian.  And then you realized that you weren't a lesbian at all, that he was really a man living in a woman's body. 
[00:23:30]  How did that happen?  Well, it was a slow process.  When I was 13 and I'm starting to go through puberty and I'm starting to have feelings of attractions to other women,  I just made the obvious connection that I must be a lesbian.  And that identity worked for a little while.  It made me feel better for a while.  But as I got older, there was just always this nagging feeling that I'm still not fitting in. 
[00:24:00]  So, is she straight now?  What do you mean straight?  Like straight man?  She was saying there that she had feelings and decided she was a lesbian.  Yeah.  But then realized, no, it's way deeper than that.  So, now that she's a man, is she now straight?  She likes women.  I'm trying to figure it out. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  It just doesn't figure.  Did she always feel like she was straight?  But was in the wrong body?  Yes, I think that's it.  That's why I don't understand this shit.  I think that's it.  That's Jennifer Aniston right there in that picture with her.  Wow, really?  You think they lezzed out at one time?  Maybe lezzed out.  There's a young Jennifer Aniston with a young, young Chasity Bono.  Before the nose job.  Look at those supple, young Jennifer Aniston tits there.  Wow, what are they doing hanging out? 
[00:25:00]  That looks like a dorm room.  And you know what happens in dorm rooms.  Oh, girls lezz out.  You close that door and lezz out.  Oh, it was one time in college.  You ever have a lesbian experience?  Yeah, once in college.  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  Did you?  At what age did she start looking, like, not good?  Because that's...  Beautiful girl when she grows up.  She's sad, though.  Look at her.  She's like, ah, I'm growing tits. 
[00:25:30]  Ah, boo tits.  Boo tits.  Trying to get her music career going with the guitar.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me say hi to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  Hi.  Yeah, you know who...  Hey, how's it going, boys?  You know who Chas looks like?  Exactly.  Big Hoss from Porn Star.  Ah, you know something?  God, all day yesterday I was trying to come up with a match. 
[00:26:00]  You asshole, Anthony.  You got it.  That's perfect.  Yeah, look at that.  Good job, brother.  Good job.  Big Hoss.  Let me say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  You know, she does sound like one particular man, I think.  Her father, Sonny Bono.  She's got that sort of nasal twang to her voice, hasn't she?  Yeah, because Sonny didn't have a manly voice.  No, no.  I think back.  It's kind of a weird, nasally...  Yeah, kind of a weak voice. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  Yeah, good job, man.  So maybe Chas there could be more manly if it wasn't in her genes to sound like her father.  Let me say hi to Tim in the Poconos.  Tim.  Hey, good morning.  How are you guys doing?  Hello.  Hey, do you think Chas broke this news to her dad on the top of the ski slope one day?  What do you think?  At the top of the ski slope, Chas said, hey, I want to become a man.  And Sonny said, I'll be right back. 
[00:27:00]  I'm going to take one more fucking run.  Sonny just beelines it right into the fucking trees.  A couple more clips from Oprah, Anthony.  We got Chas talking about how awesome it was to cut off her titties.  How awesome it was?  Yes, yes.  Jesus.  What was so fascinating is to see, first of all, you're so happy with your breasts removed.  Yes.  Yes.  That felt like what?  Because the breasts, they just from the time they grew, were just felt completely wrong on my body. 
[00:27:30]  And I hated them.  I did everything to de-emphasize them and take the attention away.  And they just made me incredibly uncomfortable.  So when they were gone, I felt physically like how I always thought I was supposed to feel.  Wow, she hated her tits.  She sure did.  Oh, did she hate those tits?  Like I said, they showed him, I guess, with the man chest in the kitchen. 
[00:28:00]  In the kitchen?  Just waking up, getting a cup of coffee.  But there wasn't hair all over the chest?  No.  What was it?  Just some, like, puby looking things surrounding the nipple?  I didn't even see that.  But maybe this is early on in the documentary.  Maybe he now has chest hair.  Now has chest hair.  I didn't see chest hair, no.  I think once those hormones kick in.  And don't they have to take those hormones, like, for the rest of their life where they turn back into, like, chick or something? 
[00:28:30]  Well, he was bragging that he's got hair on his ass now.  Big, fat, hairy ass.  She just went all out with being, like, an ugly guy.  Like an unattractive guy.  What are you going to do, man?  I don't know.  You're fat to begin with.  I'm getting in shape.  What are you going to do?  They showed him on the treadmill.  Oh, really?  Trying to drop a few LBs.  Running from a photo of her tits? 
[00:29:00]  Right, yeah.  It's like incentive.  She turns around and goes, ah, my tits.  And what do you do?  Hate those things.  Do you just throw them in the garbage?  Yeah, what do you do with those tits?  Ceremony for your dead tits?  What do you do with those things?  Well, you've got to keep the nipple, right?  Yeah, they had to keep the nipple to make the man not nipple.  So what do they do?  Just kind of cut and gut it?  Do they gut your tits?  And then just go, poof, right to the garbage?  Like, yeah, fish guts.  Like the rest of your lunch?  Yeah.  Lunchtime? 
[00:29:30]  So many questions.  So many questions.  It really just gives too many questions that people that are doing the interview aren't  willing to ask.  No.  And perhaps they're not willing to, oh, God, they're not willing to answer if you do ask.  Wouldn't you save them and turn them into, like, foot warmers in the winter?  Yeah.  You know, when you're watching TV, you just put your old tits around your tootsies?  Are they?  Keep them nice and toasty while you're watching some TV?  I don't think they just lop them off like that, though, where you can look at it and  go, hey, there's a tit. 
[00:30:00]  I think it just looks like fucking roadkill.  Just horrible?  Yeah, yeah.  They cut the insides out and then kind of...  Like upside down pizza or something?  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  One more clip from Oprah, and then we'll move on to other things.  Oprah.  Chaz's girlfriend.  Here you go, Ant.  Ah, okay.  Chaz's girlfriend likes banging him.  Chaz isn't getting a penis put on.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Well, this is breaking news.  Sexually, is having sex with Chaz the man different than Chaz the woman? 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It is.  It's better.  I have to say.  He's more alive.  Yes, actually.  Mentally and emotionally, he is more alive.  Yeah.  Well, everybody wants to know, so I will ask it.  You had the breast surgery.  Will you also have genital surgery?  At this point, I really don't have any plans to do bottom surgery, and, you know, it's interesting. 
[00:31:00]  I find that this is a topic that everybody else is a lot more interested in than I am.  I, you know, I feel really good.  I feel like a man now, and I'm really happy.  How do you feel like a man without a penis?  Without a penis?  And what do they do?  Do they just do that dumb scissor thing?  Oh, we've discussed the scissoring.  Just smushing their genitals.  How silly it is when girls are just grabbing each other's feet and legs and grinding.  Is it like, at that point, you look and go, no, you're not a man. 
[00:31:30]  I don't think so.  I think you need the penis to be considered a man.  You think it's strap-on?  Facial hair and no tits.  That's a start.  Double dong?  I don't know.  Obviously, he's got a strap-on.  You think the strap-on?  Yeah, because he wants to feel like a man, right?  Like, pounding away.  Yes!  His big gut is just fucking bleh, bleh, bleh.  On her hiney?  Oh, yeah.  Just blasting his gut all over her hiney. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  Scissoring.  Fucking South Park did something on scissoring?  On scissoring.  Yeah, they were scissoring.  Yeah.  When they got together.  Oh, yeah, scissor.  Scissor or something.  Oh, yeah, scissor.  Yeah, scissor me, Allison.  Yeah, scissor me, Allison.  Unless they just kind of scissor or something.  Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking.  Then we scissored all night long.  Scissor.  Then we scissored all night long.  You have to be careful with scissors. 
[00:32:30]  Want to go somewhere and scissor later on?  Oh, this is hot scissoring.  Scissoring me with your eyes.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, we're scissoring.  Scissor.  Scissor.  Scissoring.  Oh, yeah, scissor.  Scissor or something.  Scissor.  Scissoring.  Scissor.  Scissor.  Scissoring.  That's just him saying scissoring over and over again.  Oh, God.  Kind of funny. 
[00:33:00]  Scissoring.  It just looks dumb, girls.  Let's go to JJ in New Hampshire.  JJ.  JJ.  Morning, boys.  Hello.  Hello, JJ.  With them cutting off the tit but leaving the nipple, I just wonder if what was left over  looked like a beeswax ring that goes under your toilet.  No.  No one really.  Unless you're a plumber or done plumbing, you really don't know about that wax ring. 
[00:33:30]  Is the Oprah clip online where Chaz walks into the kitchen with no shirt on?  With his new man chest?  Because Anne's got to see that.  Yeah, I got to see what that shit looks like.  Well, big promotion for her own, I guess, because the documentary's on tonight or today.  So there's a whole documentary now?  Yeah, this was just kind of the setup.  That's what Oprah does now.  She brings these people on to talk about the big thing they did for her own channel.  Oh, look at the chastity, Chaz sweating like a man. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, why do you have to wear a suit?  Because it's a man.  Yeah, but...  So you got to wear the manliest thing.  You can wear other shit as a man, right?  No.  Why do you go and have to wear suits?  It's like where most of them grow that beard.  The first thing they do is grow a big beard.  Yeah.  The female to male.  Because they just want to be like as much man as they can.  But transgenders, they don't have shit figured out. 
[00:34:30]  No.  Because suits suck.  So if you're a girl and then you become a guy and then you feel like, oh, to be a guy,  a guy just wears suits.  They go over the top.  No one likes wearing suits, really.  They go over the top.  And then you got the guy who turns into the girl who wears like old lady dresses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think it smells like man underarms and shit?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's like a man stench.  We might have to do some time with Dr. Steve to get some of these answers. 
[00:35:00]  I don't think Dr. Steve knows about transgender enough.  I wonder if the hormone treatment makes you sweat differently.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Ugh.  No idea.  I don't know what to make of that whole thing.  Yeah.  She's happy.  Hey, whatever.  You know, as long as you're happy, whatever.  Fuck a sheep.  Whatever you need to do.  But I think you need a cock to be considered a guy.  Well, you do. 
[00:35:30]  You know, because then you're just scissoring.  Then you're just scissoring.  Like he's talking about how great their sex life is.  But it's like, what are you doing that's different than before she had her tits cut off?  The tits aren't getting in the way.  Yeah.  And then the girl is now getting pounded by a fake dick.  And does she go down on Chaz?  Ah, Jesus.  Like thinking, like, but is that too much like a woman for Chaz? 
[00:36:00]  And go, no, don't do that shit.  Why would Oprah ask about the clit?  Yeah.  That's very important to the female anatomy.  Has the clitoris grown since you've had that?  I don't know.  Or do you take the clit away, too, because that reminds you of being a female?  Well, you need that.  But if you still have the clit, and when you're naked, from the waist down, you look like a woman.  Yeah.  See, Oprah didn't do a good job.  Yeah, there's a vag there.  Right.  It doesn't matter what you call yourself.  You're a vag.  You look kind of like a guy with your suit and your new sideburns. 
[00:36:30]  But when you get ready for a shower, you realize you're still a girl.  There's no bulge there in the pants.  No bulge.  You can't adjust, put it to the left, the right.  Did she sew it up?  Sew that vag up?  And what about, I guess the hormones would stop the periods, unless she's already gone through menopause.  I don't know how old she is.  I think she's about 43, 44.  Probably all pissed off, getting hot flashes.  And will she get hot flashes? 
[00:37:00]  Will she go through menopause?  I don't know.  These are all the questions that never, ever get answered.  No.  It's like those fucking, that two-headed girl.  I saw a whole documentary on that two-headed girl.  A new one?  Well, there was, it used clips from the old one, but it was longer.  We're talking about the one that rides a bike with two heads?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the girl.  It's got two heads.  The famous two girls.  And then it's big, wide shoulders.  Right.  And then down at the bottom, it's just two legs and one vag and one ass and everything like that. 
[00:37:30]  So I don't, there's too many questions that people like, I want them answered.  Yeah.  You know, because now they've got to be fucking at this point.  Right.  How old are they?  How does that work?  They've got to be mid-20s by now.  We've been talking about that for years.  Or at least early 20s.  That's got to be like a threesome-y thing with one vagina, but there's two heads yapping at you.  You would have to do it.  Oh, I would definitely do it for the story.  You would have to have sex with the two-headed monster.  I would do it for the story. 
[00:38:00]  You know, you'd have sex and then you're yapping at the two heads.  They're like, hey, how are you digging this?  Hey, how does that feel?  Hey, you like it?  Hey.  Hey, who's feeling this right now?  You like that?  Are you feeling this?  I'm just going to feel your tit.  Right.  Right.  Actually, I only feel it if you put it in her ass.  And yeah.  Well, you know what?  Their body is split in half.  Sort of.  Nerve-wise, because like one controls one leg, one controls the other leg, so when they  walk, it's really this kind of coordination that they need. 
[00:38:30]  So I wonder if the clitoris nerves are divided between the two.  So if you're diddling that one clit, are they both getting off?  That'd be the weirdest thing, watching two heads and just listening to two girls moaning  as you're just diddling one fucking clit.  Right.  Wow, how convenient.  How great.  Oh, how convenient.  Because with a real threesome, it's like a spinning plate.  It's exhausting.  It's like that juggler with a chainsaw and bowling balls, and you just don't know what 
[00:39:00]  to do, it's a lot going on.  You're a busy man.  Then you start liking one girl a little more than the other.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I realized the threesome was cool, but I really like the one more.  It's like, I'll just hang out and actually have real sex with this one and just lean  my arm over and diddle this one.  Or how about the third girl that was introduced is way hotter than the original girl.  So now when things are happening, you're spending all of your time on the new girl because you  fucked the old girl before.  So now you're just concentrating on new hotter girl. 
[00:39:30]  You want new hot girl.  And not even making it like, like not even trying to hide the fact that you're doing  Not hiding.  You're getting looks from the other girl like, what is this?  And you look at her like, what do you want me to do?  I had one of those experiences where it was like, and I don't want you having sex with  her unless it's all three of us.  All right.  She goes in the bathroom to take a shower.  Fucking like crazy.  Fucking like crazy. 
[00:40:00]  And then what?  As soon as she came out of the shower, what happens?  Does she make believe you're just watching TV?  Watching TV with fucking, you know, wet spots all over the bed.  He's sweaty.  Yeah, all sweaty.  Yeah.  No, I'm just watching TV.  Yeah, those threesomes don't work out very well.  That's a weird thing.  Maybe if you're a Vulcan and can honestly just throw your emotions away and legitimately just  look, okay, this is two people. 
[00:40:30]  That will equal our time.  Right.  You always wind up gravitating to the newest one in the pack.  Always.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  That's why the tweet yesterday.  Hey, is anyone else watching Oprah?  Yeah.  That was some fucked up TV.  Yeah.  I want to see the documentary, though, just to see what the fuck's going on there.  I think I got to watch that today.  I think I got to.  I think it's on OWN tonight.  Or today.  That OWN.  Maybe that's something that, you know, got that OWN thing going.  Documentaries on fucking transgenders. 
[00:41:00]  I think she's doing it.  Nothing else is getting it going.  I think ratings are down.  Yeah.  I think Elo's worrying about his job.  No, because they fired the person that was in charge of OWN.  I think Elo's job is pretty much, is he the president?  Or is Oprah the president?  Who's the president of Oprah?  Well, you could have, like, she's the head muckety-muck.  And then Elo's the next level.  And then he's, like, the president kind of a thing. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Whatever.  But he's right below Oprah.  Wow.  You can't go any higher than Elo unless you're Oprah.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that hurts.  How did he get that?  God.  Because he wheels and deals.  And he's a scammer.  He really is.  And he just knows how to fucking make relationships.  Now, wouldn't you think, though, that puts you in the line of fire if things don't work well?  Sure.  She'll be like, we got a clean house.  Let's get a whole new crew in here.  I think he was brought on.  I'm not sure if his job title has changed or his duties have changed.  But he was brought on to define what Oprah means after the show goes off the air. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  So it's own, but I think it's other stuff, too.  I think it's, like, podcasting and, you know, the whole social networking thing.  And, I don't know, marketing her in other ways and all that shit.  So I don't think he's just responsible for own.  Okay.  The TV network.  I don't think.  He's, like, responsible for branding her.  Yeah, I would have a better.  And not in the way that a cowboy would.  I would have a better answer to that question, but, you know, he's long gone. 
[00:42:30]  He doesn't.  He wouldn't be calling and playing those sound effects on the phone anymore.  No, there was a transitional period where we were still, you know, in touch with each other.  No sending dick cockpicks.  Now I get a one-word response when I text him.  Yeah, yeah.  Good, great.  All right.  Occasionally tweet something that might have something to do with our show.  Yeah, I get it.  I get it.  Yeah, I get it.  You have moved on officially, and we're stuck in this hellhole.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks for not, you know, going somewhere that you could have brought us with you.  Yeah, yeah.  He went somewhere. 
[00:43:00]  Thanks for that.  He went somewhere where there is no effing way we could ever possibly go.  And that's, you know, as far as media goes, when one of your guys goes somewhere cool,  you get excited, and you just know it's a matter of time before you get the phone call.  Yeah, he's bringing us over, man.  He's bringing us over.  Right, right.  But it's impossible.  Like, owned?  And we were his guys.  We'd sooner be on the Logo channel before owned.  He went through.  Logo.  I think he's transgender.  Is he?  He does look a little, he's at least very metrosexual.  But he went from a guy's world, and now he's in a female's world, where one of his jobs 
[00:43:30]  is to pet Oprah's dog in meetings.  Do you think the guys that work for Oprah, like Elo, get together like Elo and some other  guy, and just kind of behind closed doors go like, he's dealing with these fucking bitches  all fucking day with their yakking, yakking, and yakking?  I love your thought.  Yeah.  And I could answer it.  Yeah.  Because I do watch this behind-the-scenes show. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  That they do have on own.  It's a reality show.  Yeah, I've seen it.  And he is the only straight male that I've seen on the whole show.  Oh, they're all gay, right?  And I think that's why he's playing the part of almost gay.  Almost gay.  So he fits in.  He's not all gay.  Like, he's not going to do anything crazy.  He's executive vice president.  Right.  So that's as high as you get.  So the rest of the guys there are flaming gay guys.  Wow.  So he can't bitch to anybody. 
[00:44:30]  So he can't even get in the room because the gay guys love the yakking women.  Yeah.  I haven't seen another straight guy on that whole show.  Only Elo.  Wow.  And he's wearing pink shirts now.  So just so he could fit in a little bit.  I think he's just in a room somewhere at some point getting a blowjob from a gay guy  just going like, oh, how did this happen?  How did this happen?  With his pink shirt open at the bottom and pants around his knees.  He would tell you that pink is one of those power colors in the corporate world now.  Oh, yeah.  And I think he's wearing that.  So, you know, Oprah's hairdresser feels a little more comfortable. 
[00:45:00]  As long as he doesn't have a sock to match.  Oh.  Elo, we do miss you.  It might not sound like it, but we miss you, brother.  What happened to you?  You went from a mongoloid hair fucking man to a pink shirted half a guy.  Gay guy.  Well, just trying to fit in.  I don't think he's living the lifestyle.  I think he's just looking a little.  Best picture ever.  A little bit.  What, the split screen?  The split screen.  The old and the new. 
[00:45:30]  He's so cleaned up in that picture.  The one on the left was taken maybe an hour after he stopped drinking.  He looks like a mongoloid in that old picture.  It's amazing how dumb he looks.  He looks like if your brother had Down syndrome, you would bring him to work because you know  he wouldn't do anything crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's what it looks like.  He looks like his retarded brother.  Right.  Like, that's like, oh, let me introduce you to, you know, to fucking Scotty Logan. 
[00:46:00]  He's a retard.  You know, be nice to him.  Scotty, sit here.  I got to talk with Oprah for a little while.  Don't move.  Watch this.  And he just puts cartoons on one of the monitors and down there at Harpo.  Right.  The new fucking.  He's almost GQ.  Go get her, Elo.  It's fucked up.  He's fucking a mover and a shaker. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, God.  Why don't we break here, Ant?  Where my motherfucking sandwich?  You're saying boo.  God damn.  Where my sandwich?  I need coffee, too.  I don't know who could go today.  Because now we're going to go into Marshalls, and then I'm an anchor, and I got no sandwich.  And then when I start eating my sandwich, we come back, and I have some food in my mouth.  God damn.  All right.  Other stuff on the way.  She.  You know now.  She.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  She.  We had them in.  She.  I know.  All those people we had in, and I had no clue who they were.  Three episodes left.  That's it.  That's it.  Of the water.  I noticed something with doing a marathon, because I've been, I blasted through five  seasons of The Wire.  I got three.  Less than two weeks, right?  Less than two weeks.  That's unbelievable.  And I'm not sure if this happens with the marathon. 
[00:47:30]  When you're watching the show for its original first run on HBO every week, and you have to  wait pretty much a year in between seasons.  Easily a year, yeah.  It was, some of them were over a year between seasons.  Right.  You get to the point where you really start missing the characters, I guess, and then when  it comes back, you're psyched to see what happened and what changed.  And I think you get more attached to the characters when you watch it like that than you do the 
[00:48:00]  marathon.  The marathon is very fast, and things change very quickly.  Right.  And I don't think, you have as much visual time and time with the show as you would if  you watched it live on the air.  Right.  But I don't think you're getting as attached to the characters.  That's interesting.  I don't know how that works, but it's cool because you're seeing the entire thing in  one swipe.  I don't think you have time to miss your show or the characters.  Right.  And then when they come back, you're like, holy shit, this is so cool.  They're back. 
[00:48:30]  Because I know when one episode ends and the music's going, I could just, blam, I hit  it.  And then the next one's starting.  And that used to mean I got a whole fucking week to wait.  Right.  You know, fuck the season to season.  Just show to show.  Like most shows you can watch, and if you've got a week to wait, you're fine with it.  But when you really get hooked on a show and those credits roll, you're like, fuck, I  got a whole week before I get to see this again.  And it ends with something huge.  You're like, oh, man.  And I think it makes you really want to see it again. 
[00:49:00]  Not that, believe me, I think this show's fucking great.  I'm digging it, and the character development is fantastic.  But I wonder if it's more so when you watch it over the course of five years.  I think you're onto something.  Then when you did the marathon.  Remember Sopranos would end, and you're like, okay, it ended.  Oh, fuck, they're not on next week.  Yeah.  I got to wait at least a year.  And then you're thinking, fuck, a year?  This is never going to.  And then when it's like, all right, we got a month left.  Right.  And everyone starts talking about it again.  Right.  And then it's like, all right, HBO, world premiere of the new season of Sopranos. 
[00:49:30]  Pshh.  Oh, it's HBO.  And then you watch it, and it was like, wow, a big event.  But this, to me, is just one press on that remote, and I'm new episode, new season.  You're time traveling, really.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden, it would have been a year, and you're like, fuck that year shit.  It's going to be two minutes.  I'm going to go.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a leak.  I'm pausing.  And I'm coming back, and I'm going to jump ahead a year.  Right.  I'll jump ahead a year.  And the people are getting older very quickly on the marathon, as opposed to a year goes 
[00:50:00]  by, the new show starts.  I don't know if you notice so much that they're getting older, because you haven't seen the  previous season.  Well, it doesn't jump.  Yeah.  You see them age immediately.  You go from one season to another, and it's like, wow, that was almost a kid, and now it's  like a guy.  It's an odd thing, the marathon.  Three to go.  As opposed to the actual show and watching it like that.  I don't know which is better.  I mean, it's better that you can see the whole fucking thing at once, or you've got to wait. 
[00:50:30]  You're not at their mercy.  Did you, well, you already know this.  Omar?  Not yet.  Really?  Nope.  Not yet.  It was one of the last three?  Yeah.  It's got to be one of the last three.  He did get his leg fucked up, and that one scene where he goes up to that guy and starts  talking, and he just goes like, fuck it.  Right.  He blows his fucking head off.  Amazing.  That's fucking fantastic, man.  Let me know when you get to that one.  Oh, I'll let you know.  I've been waiting for it, because I know it's going to happen. 
[00:51:00]  Because me and Jimmy have talked about that a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I want to know what you think about that whole thing.  Because it is gearing up.  If I hadn't known what was going to happen, it's gearing up for an epic battle between two  fucking guys that are the power players of the street.  Let me know.  Yeah.  Maybe tomorrow you'll know.  Yeah, I will know tomorrow.  I'm going to blast through the last three tomorrow.  Or actually today, you know, after the work and stuff.  I can't wait to get your angle on the whole thing. 
[00:51:30]  But it's, you know, obviously I'm talking about a show that started in 2002.  I know.  I think, but...  And we had every single guy from the show on at this point.  Believe me, I've looked at the pictures and been like, holy shit, I took a picture with  that guy.  This is fucking great.  You didn't even know him at the time.  I didn't know.  When Bubz came in here...  Fucking Bubz!  I'm like, look at the picture.  That's a motherfucking Bubz!  You didn't even know that day.  Fuck!  Me and Jimmy were like, holy shit, Bubz is in the studio.  And it really wasn't that long ago, fucking Bunk was in here.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  Right.  But in all fairness, Jimmy kind of turned me on to the wire.  And then we started getting the guys on the show. 
[00:52:00]  And I was behind.  So when I was talking to these guys, I didn't know what happened to them.  But I knew who they were, because I was already watching.  So I was in a weird place, too, for a lot of those interviews.  Fucking cool, though.  And I think the other thing is, you could talk about the show, and it's still relatable,  because I think a lot of people are, right now, kind of just picking it up and running  through the entire series.  The box set.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's just a damn good show.  Absolutely.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Okay, hey, when we get back...  My sandwich is here.  Yay.  I want a cup of coffee.  See, this would be a great job for an intern.  A what?  What are those?  If Jimmy was here, I would...  You're extinct.  I would just fucking leave the show to get my own coffee.  But I can't have you just sitting here.  Eh, you know.  I know you're more than capable of doing it.  Try to take a run.  I would love to take a coffee run.  Commercial, you just run.  You think I could do it?  I don't know.  Ten minutes?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Now I talk.  It's a nice day.  Huh?  It's a nice day.  It's a nice day.  We've been doing radio long enough where we should have interns, I'm thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  When we get back, annoying 30 seconds, we're going to announce the winner.  Yes, and we're doing it.  Yes, we knocked it down to three.  Yep.  So we got third place, second place, and of course the winner.  So we'll announce that right after the break and then get into some other things.  We got a face transplant guy.  Yeah.  You saw the pictures, right?  Oh, I certainly did. 
[00:53:30]  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  That is even more confusing than the transgender shit.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want to walk.  Ah, well, we'll have our thoughts after the break.  Stay there.  Sirius XM, the virus.  The virus.  The opening at the show.  How cool was Larry King yesterday?  I thought that was pretty cool indeed.  I told a lot of people that it was a career highlight.  People like Larry King, you know, a legend in the broadcast industry since pretty much its inception. 
[00:54:00]  We were interviewing the interviewer.  Right.  It's really strange.  Larry King.  I just wanted him to interview us.  Yeah.  You know, who are we kidding, Larry?  Just start interviewing us.  You're not important enough.  How important are the microphones for your broadcast?  And by that I mean the expensive microphones or something.  He had a Jimmy Hoffa story.  Yeah.  He knew Jimmy Hoffa when he was live. 
[00:54:30]  Just about all of us know Jimmy Hoffa as a dead guy.  Yeah.  The dead disappearing guy.  He had a Frank Sinatra story, Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce.  I've known them all.  And he had a great sense of humor.  And they're all dead.  And he answered the grocery question.  Yep.  And the skateboard question.  We should replay that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He answered the skateboard question for Sam.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  Was it good?  Yeah.  Why don't we have that clip today? 
[00:55:00]  Because Sam hogged it for his show.  Well, can we have it for our show, Sam?  I don't know.  Ask Sam.  It's his show.  Sam?  Where's Sam?  Now he's running down the hall.  He's probably prepping for his show.  Because that's a very famous thing we've done on the show, too.  The skateboard guy.  Of course it is.  But I got to hear it on Sam's show.  I got to hear it yesterday.  And Sam, why don't we have this?  Why wouldn't we have that?  Why couldn't you save this for today's show?  Why did you have to have new material for the wrap-up show? 
[00:55:30]  Right.  Well, it's not the wrap-up show.  It's the wrap-up show.  You sure?  Yes, it is.  Why couldn't you save this for today?  You're getting a little rambunctious there with your duties on this show.  It is an Opie and Anthony kind of live after the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, but the point would be to talk to people who are just on the show, and then they say something,  and then you reflect on what just happened on the show with a little bit of hallway audio.  Oh, yeah?  Like, why would I... 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, but the skateboard is a big one.  But I never get an interview with somebody you just interviewed so you could play tomorrow.  But the skateboard one's a big one.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  Plus, I told you about it yesterday.  Why don't you just say save it for us?  How come it wasn't here?  Even if you didn't play it, you know, that's fine.  No, in the 10 o'clock hour, you could have said, Larry King just left, and I asked him some stuff in the hallway.  You're not going to believe it, and Opie and Anthony will have that for you tomorrow.  That's a team player.  That would be nice.  That's a team player.  I told you what he said yesterday, before the 10 o'clock show. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, I know, but we were too busy trying to get to the elevator.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's the problem, man.  We were too busy trying to get out of here.  Patrice!  There he is.  Are you famous?  It's O'Neal.  He is O'Neal.  Very famous.  Don't even do that.  Patrice.  I try to get...  Heard a lot about you guys.  Yeah.  Why don't you take a seat, Patrice?  Great to have you on the show, finally.  What?  Oh, yes, sit right there.  Sit there.  That's fine.  Good to meet you.  When he was gone for two weeks, I wanted you on the show, and they're saying you're in 
[00:57:00]  L.A. getting famous.  Did he get famous?  No.  Not really?  Give me a chance to settle in and meet you guys.  No, because he's going to spin this.  You guys are legends, man.  He knows he got a lot of phone calls about coming in while you were on that cruise.  I hope.  I didn't get Patrice once in those two weeks.  Yeah, I was trying to...  Get famous in L.A.  I had a lot of time to go do that.  Yeah.  Because I didn't... 
[00:57:30]  You know...  No!  I usually do radio around.  No.  No.  How does this work?  Travis.  Look, he's all out of place and nervous.  The last time we talked to Patrice, he just did his special, which was a great special.  And then he was hoping to get famous from that.  And then we tried calling him when you were out, Ant, doing your cruise thing, and he was  in L.A. being famous.  That's what I heard.  Some people are trying to help me be famous, but I think I have a long standing... 
[00:58:00]  It's just a trail of...  Oh.  There's like one or two really good businesses that's trying to help.  Yeah.  But I think they have meetings with people that go, did you know?  And then...  Oh, no.  No.  I've done too many corporate mistakes.  They go down that road and take that bridge right there, and then you go up to the bridge  and it's like, oh, I remember burning this one.  Oh, no.  And I'm starting to...  I remember burning that.  I got to...  You know, I'm starting to...  I'm starting to watch things that make you... 
[00:58:30]  You just want...  I want some things.  Yeah.  And I've been watching HD theater, and they just show cars and cars and cars and cars.  Oh.  I want a couple of cars.  Yeah.  Cars are good.  And I didn't want a couple of cars, but now I do.  I want to...  You know, I'm just learning about these fucking cars.  What kind of cars?  You know, it's just interesting.  A 72 Stingray is worth a million.  But a 72 Stingray built in October is worth $2.  And you go, wow, that shit is beautiful. 
[00:59:00]  HD theater is beautiful, man.  Wheeler and dealer.  I just...  I'm sitting there, and I want some stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  Wow, that's pretty sharp.  But it's just like, these cars...  But it's all this shit, these...  It's just, you know, I want cars now.  Yeah.  Now you're...  But I can't afford it.  I'm not going to, you know.  But I will give this...  You know, I'll announce it one of these days if it works out, but, you know...  You might have something? 
[00:59:30]  Something in the pipe?  Yeah.  But, you know...  You never know, though, right?  You just can't even...  Oh, you don't know.  Did you trim down while you were getting famous?  Yeah, this diabetes is starting to take its toll.  No, it's not a good thing that you're trimming down?  No, I'm saying I have to eat.  You look trim.  I just stopped eating shit.  Yeah.  Did you lose some LBs?  Yeah, just because you stopped eating shit, and then...  You look different.  But your body, I read about it.  Boy, diabetes is hilariously brutal. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, shit.  But it's just...  It doesn't get the shock factor as AIDS and cancer.  No, no, no.  It's like diabetes, good to...  Yeah, really?  Because people, like, you know, they can control it and live with it, but it's like a pain in the ass.  It's a motherfucker.  You've got to have a lot of discipline.  You can't even shit right.  It's like the sugar takes your body...  Sugar's poison.  It's tasty, though.  It is tasty.  It makes no sense to have something so tasty.  It's processed sugar's poison, and regular sugar's poison. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  So if your body doesn't regulate sugar correctly and get it out your system...  Yeah.  ...starts to do bad things, man.  God damn.  You got some shit going numb yet?  Not my feet.  My right thumb is weird.  I can't find a button on the iPhone.  iPhone if I'm turning the iPhone a little bit, but it's not...  It hasn't ravaged.  I still see pretty good.  You know, I can...  You know, but...  Yeah.  It will...  And you're not going to catch me, one of these motherfuckers that's, like, brave about it. 
[01:01:00]  I'm just going to disappear.  Brave.  Like an elephant?  As soon as I know, I'm going to just write my girl a will and tell her to divvy it up.  Divvy it what I got up.  Which is jack shit.  Or go to the elephant graveyard.  Walk off somewhere.  You think I'm going to sit around and be brave about it and be uncomfortable while George Carlin's  face blew up, looked like a...  But he wasn't...  Like a salamander.  Nah, but he...  Whatever was wrong with him...  His heart was going.  Right. 
[01:01:30]  And when your heart goes...  So it wasn't pumping as well, so you get a lot of water in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just...  Your feet swell up.  Your head swells up.  Jesus.  What is it called?  A deem...  A deema?  A deema, maybe?  So...  You can't pump the fluids as well.  So where do you go?  And then fucking if I jerk off twice a week, you know, I got to fucking plan to fuck my  girl because if I jerk off twice, that's it for the end of the day.  Really?  Fucking is done.  It's weird you're saying all this because you look really healthy.  Well, you know...  You trim down, man.  It's called rock bottom. 
[01:02:00]  It's called...  It's called like if I was a drug addict, I'm like, you know, all my veins are shut down  and I have to fucking...  No more vein.  I'm shooting a vein in my fucking taint.  I'm shooting a needle in the vein in my taint and I'm like, I got to stop this shit.  The only fucking vein left.  He hit his diabetes bottom.  Yeah, getting up to piss 75 times a night.  It just fucking wears you down. 
[01:02:30]  When you're young, you just, you know...  Oh, wow.  And that'll never go away.  Yeah.  Did you really tweet this after the Celtics lost last night?  Was there?  Well, it's with the A at the end, so I'll deal with this.  Well, Danny Ainge will be sending a few folks to the nigga glue factory and maybe Ray Allen  will get to stud.  Yep.  That's it.  Sam, hold on.  It's done.  Stay close.  Sam's trying to slip out.  Fucking Celtics looked off on that overtime, man.  They had a...  They're 50 years old, man. 
[01:03:00]  But they played the Heat pretty tough the whole game.  But they're not pussies.  They're just old.  They're old, so they ran out of steam.  Not everybody's Bernard Hopkins.  Them motherfuckers is...  Shaq is fat.  Shaq is a 7-foot-2-inch fat man.  Fat man.  And he used to be Diesel, right?  They used to call him Diesel, right?  When he was young, boy, he'd tear this whole building down with his fucking one blow.  But now he does look like a fat man.  He's just a fat man.  Face swollen, still trying to be funny.  Mustache. 
[01:03:30]  And I'm going to tell you, when you start getting old, when your mustache gets irrelevant.  When you don't know how to fucking trim your mustache in a young, relevant way, get the  fuck out of town.  Go fuck yourself with your mustache growing inside your mouth.  You don't even give a fuck no more.  Inside your mouth.  If you got old man mustache, Shaq's mustache, you got a full man chew.  Fucking fat fucker.  But he's just not...  He just needs to go.  Fuck it.  I'm getting scared.  The Heat might win this thing.  I don't want...  No, the Heat is going to win. 
[01:04:00]  I don't want the whole thing.  I don't want to see that, man.  It's going to happen.  You're saying that?  It's just...  LeBron is the greatest role player ever.  If you're into basketball at all, you know, you got Jordan Pippen.  He's ten times better than Pippen.  Uh-huh.  Wade's not Jordan, though.  Wade is the Jordan of them.  I understand that, but he's not Jordan.  No, he's not Jordan.  He's almost Jordan.  But that's what I'm saying.  And LeBron is way better than Pippen.  And LeBron physically is way better than Jordan, but he just ain't got the fucking mind. 
[01:04:30]  The heart.  Yeah.  So he's like, go sick him, LeBron, and let Dwayne shoot at the end.  You know what I'm saying?  They can't beat them.  They just can't.  And even Chris Bosh, as fruity as he is and not...  He's just a fruity guy.  He's so uncomfortable to look at.  Because he's fruity, and you know, you can't get sued saying, oh, he's gay, but he's just  a fruity guy, and he's very...  Flamboyant. 
[01:05:00]  He's a flamboyant guy.  And I'm not saying he's gay, because you don't have to be, you know, but the guy is.  But he's even better than any of the other Celtics' secondary people.  He's a first guy.  And at the end of the day, they're just too old to fuck with Miami Heat.  And their role players, Miami's role players are just as good as anybody else's role players  in the whole league, so...  And they just scramble to get those guys to start the season.  But look, man, to be fair to Boston, or to be fair to the Black Celtics, the Celtics sucked 
[01:05:30]  for a long time.  This is my beef with Boston sports fans.  We stunk in a lot of things for a lot of years.  And even the Bruins fans, don't get uppity.  Just enjoy what you have.  We had a good three-and-a-half-year run when they drafted.  I mean, they put these old men together for the Celtics.  They still play at a high level, but they're fucking in their 30s. 
[01:06:00]  And when you're a sports player, there is no midlife crisis.  Midlife crisis is 32.  Oh, shit.  Kobe can't even beat it.  Kobe's old.  Everybody's old.  Yeah, Lakers got swept.  Did you see that coming?  Did I see?  No!  Of course not.  Dallas is a good team, though.  But Pau Gasol's fruity, too.  Lamar Odom's pussy whipped.  That's what happens.  And Pau...  You're not talking wrong. 
[01:06:30]  Pau is mad at Kobe.  People don't want to speculate, but he's mad at Kobe because Kobe's wife convinced his  fiancée to leave him.  What?  And he hates Kobe now.  Oh, shit.  There's all kinds of drama.  That's what happened to him.  It was drama.  He's getting involved with that shit.  He's Kobe's fucking wife.  Is this real?  Yes.  And Pau is fruity because one day the whole league turned against Pau and said he's soft,  right?  Right.  And Pau went... 
[01:07:00]  He didn't go, fuck them.  His response was...  You know, he put his head to the side on his own shoulder and kind of went, they're just  jealous and I don't pay no attention.  Like, you undude.  Fruit.  Fuck you.  And his brother's an animal.  Yeah.  His baby brother is another fatty, but he's seven feet tall fat man, but he's 21 or some  goofy shit like that.  So he's like a Spanish Shaq, but Pau got angry about this girl and then Lamar's on 
[01:07:30]  a show where his wife is telling him who his friends are and how much money to spend.  And she looks at his career like it's kind of a cute thing he does.  Isn't that weird?  He's on the fucking Lakers.  She's on the leaders and he's a fucking nigger.  He's a nigger.  She's from money.  I've seen some clips and she's like, oh yeah, you're going to practice. 
[01:08:00]  It's like a cute little thing he does.  And he's playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.  And he lost his swagger.  He's short.  That's what happens when you listen to a bitch.  For any reason.  That's probably why my toes are hurting.  Even my girl tell me to take my medicine.  I'm like, bitch, mind your business.  I'd rather fucking have my swagger and no feet than fucking you infiltrating and telling  me what's good and what's not.  Now I got to listen to you fucking give me advice. 
[01:08:30]  Footless swagger.  What the fuck did this reverse?  When did Rankin Fowl fucking reverse?  Your Celtics are done, bro.  Yeah, no, they're done.  They're fucking done.  And I don't have...  I didn't know that Kobe shit either.  Some good inside crap.  Yeah, man, pal.  But of course it's speculation because no one ever tells the fucking goddamn truth.  Well, the LeBron James mom thing is still speculation, right?  That never officially came out.  It never was official.  But you see her behavior in Miami.  She's smacking people in the face.  She's, you know, and it probably wasn't. 
[01:09:00]  And the reason why they're not hitting Delonte West in his face in his game and knocking  him, it's because it's probably his mom's fault.  Like, she's aggressive.  She's probably like, baby, come here.  You know?  And he's like, it's James.  It's two sides to every story.  Like, would you think a motherfucker's that crazy to go, psst, come here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever her first name is.  Roletta.  I don't know if it's a perfect friend, but.  Roletta.  Hey, Miss Jane, come here.  Let me talk to you for a minute.  Let me fuck you real quick.  Like, you can see her going. 
[01:09:30]  Because she smacked the guy in the face and go, do you know who the fuck I am?  So, if you kind of fucking.  Some dude's like, you know, he's walking around.  She's like, I like, I like.  And she's, I guess she's fucking my age.  She's in her 40s or some shit.  I don't think my mama minded much what he was doing to her.  Like, Sling Blade.  She fucking walks in.  The guy's banging his mom and he kills them both.  She might have been aggressive, man.  She didn't mind what he was doing to her. 
[01:10:00]  She can't be more than early 40s.  No, she's very young.  And she has nothing better to do.  It's got to be a nightmare for LeBron.  And she looks exactly like him.  Oh, yeah.  So, it's like, you know who I am?  And it's like, she's smacking people in the face.  And da, da, da.  So, I mean, I can see.  And he looks like she's from Cleveland.  And that's where Bone Thugs-N-Harmony is from.  Yeah.  And she probably grew up listening to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.  And Delonte West looks like one of the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony motherfuckers.  The thuggest, ruckiest bone guys with the fucking light-skinned face. 
[01:10:30]  And...  Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.  And she looks like...  He looks like the guy...  Delonte West looks like the guy all the way to the left.  Really?  Except for he got red hair and a bunch of tattoos.  So, she probably thought he was cute as a motherfucker.  Sexy.  She's like, come here.  Why would he do that?  Hide behind the popcorn.  Come here.  Why the fuck did he do that?  It could have been jealousy.  It could have been the fact that he's a dude.  It's hard to turn down pussy. 
[01:11:00]  LeBron's mom?  If you got pregnant, man, can you imagine?  In the fucking loins?  He has a little kid from...  That's what I'm hitting at.  Maybe you want to take a shot at the lottery.  That you can pump out one more.  One more LeBron.  And he gets super mad with that shit.  And he goes, fuck this.  I don't need to do this basketball thing.  I'll let my little fucking son do it.  I'm telling you, man.  Maybe.  But see, the difference between him and fucking Pau Gasol is LeBron still is dropping 40.  And it don't matter.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm getting scared. 
[01:11:30]  Dallas is pretty strong.  I just don't want to see the Heat win this fucking thing.  They're going to win.  They are going to win the whole fucking thing.  They're peaking at the right time, right?  They're going to win.  I mean, they're just going to.  Hey, Sam came in here because we had Larry King on yesterday, Patrice.  On this show?  Yeah.  It was pretty cool.  I got to be honest with you.  It was really cool shit.  Did y'all fucking dig into him?  Or did you let him be an old man and just fade away?  Well, he...  Nah, man.  He held his own.  He killed.  He was hilarious. 
[01:12:00]  He got in there and told some stories.  I'm sure you had the Larry King guys.  Everybody called.  We didn't do Larry King.  It was hard because...  It was hard to get in at times because he was telling stories and all that.  But we had...  Good stories, too?  He had stories about Lenny Bruce, Jackie Gleason on the Jackie Gleason party train.  He had a Jimmy Hoffa story when Jimmy Hoffa was alive.  That he remembered?  Yeah, I know.  Fuck yeah.  Who else?  Don Rickles.  He was telling us about Frank Sinatra.  What was the best story? 
[01:12:30]  What was the best story?  What was the pop story?  What was the wow factor?  I don't know.  I think the wow factor was asking him about that goddamn...  Where were the groceries after the rape story he told?  Remember that clip?  What did he say?  Remember the clip where the girl got abducted and raped horribly?  In the car.  But she was abducted coming out of a grocery store, so there were groceries in the car.  And Larry goes, what happened to the food?  She tells the horrid story of being raped, but in the middle of it...  Yay!  In the middle of it, yeah, she says like...  We played it for him.  So I had the groceries in the front seat, and he came in, and he started grabbing me, 
[01:13:00]  and he handcuffed me to the steering wheel and sexually abused me.  And the first question, he's like, what happened to the food?  What did he say?  Let's play it.  Fuck it.  You're here for a while.  What did he say after he...  Here's the whole thing.  To you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  No, we got the clip from yesterday.  Good, good, good.  I think the whole thing is four minutes.  It's worth listening to.  From yesterday, Larry King, he was just great, and here we go.  I have to ask you something that I've been toiling over since I heard it. 
[01:13:30]  Toil!  This was something where you said something during an interview where I couldn't fathom this.  It was a woman, she was talking about a horrific rape that had happened, and it was in her car,  I believe, and she had gone shopping, grocery shopping, and she describes this horrible situation of this sexual assault,  and you actually asked, your first question to her was, what did you do with the groceries?  Do you remember that one?  No, but it would have been something I'd ask. 
[01:14:00]  What happened to the groceries?  I was like, that is probably the most inappropriate thing you could have asked at the moment.  She was taken aback by other questions.  I would love to know your mindset behind something like that.  I have no memory of that.  I swear to God.  Do you have the clip?  I'm trying to find it.  Yeah, because I would love to put it.  My only guess, if you have, I hope you have the clip, because then I could have an explanation.  Put it in context, right.  Put it in context.  Now, maybe...  Why can't I find it?  Okay.  Yeah, pop that in.  Track 18.  This was the...  Well, I got the long version.  All right.  Okay, that's good. 
[01:14:30]  That'll put it in context.  It was about a minute.  It's got to queue up.  As I came out of the grocery store and got in my car, Philip knocked on my window and said,  you know, I can't seem to get my car to start.  It's cold.  Do you think you'd give me a ride?  You know, which way are you going?  And of course, he was going to go any way, any which way I was going.  And so, I did.  Why did you let him in the car?  I don't know.  It was the worst decision I've ever made, I think.  It truly was.  What happened when he got in?  When he got in, I filled his hands with a lot of food that I had in the front seat anyway. 
[01:15:00]  I tried to engage him in...  He was holding your food?  He was.  I tried to engage him in small conversation on the trip.  I tried to stay on the main street.  And when I got ready to turn, he said, well, where I'm staying is right up the road here.  So, I took him a little further up and then just turned around the corner and pulled over.  And he slammed my head into the steering wheel and pulled out handcuffs. 
[01:15:30]  He took my keys out, threw him on the floor and pulled out handcuffs and handcuffed me.  And said, I just want a piece of ass.  If you'd be good, you won't get hurt.  What did he do with the food?  He put her on the floor, I guess.  That was a very...  Stop right there.  Okay, okay.  Now, you see you guys taking out of context.  You took it totally out of context.  I finally get an answer, though.  This is fantastic.  Wait a minute.  Of course.  Wait a minute.  Obsessed.  Obsessed.  We played that clip a lot.  You played a lot?  Yes.  That was great questioning. 
[01:16:00]  Okay.  I got her in the car.  Finally.  Why did she let the guy in the car?  Okay.  I got her driving, right?  Now, I got her driving.  Now, she said there was food in the car.  Yeah.  The guy, by the way, as I'm trying to remember this case because it was...  1976.  It was Philip Garrido.  Yeah.  Garrido.  Garrido.  Was later charged with harboring a...  He hit a woman for years.  He's still alive somewhere.  The Garrido case.  Okay.  He denied it.  His lawyer was denying it.  So, part of a good police investigation would be, you said there was food in the front of 
[01:16:30]  the car, right?  He's knocking you out of the car.  He's taking you out of the car.  What happened to the food?  Did he knock the food over?  Was the food found at the scene?  One of my great moments.  Oh.  All right.  Investigative reporting.  You're taking it out of...  See, you ask it as just as if a woman said I was raped.  What happened to the food?  That's not what happened.  So, you guys are paying...  Does he turn this on us?  I think he is.  This can't happen.  He's finally taken it on us. 
[01:17:00]  What you did...  You've been playing that for a long time?  For a while.  That was terrible radio.  Well, now at least we know you were...  Because she seemed like a sympathetic kind of character at the time.  But you were actually trying to trip her up, it seemed.  I didn't try to make her unsympathetic.  We felt like you were obsessed with the food.  I wasn't obsessed.  I'm trying to get the whole story.  How did the guy get in?  He's knocked her out.  Right.  She's driven to a place.  He's got her around the corner.  He's got the food.  Remember?  Where is the food?  Where is the food? 
[01:17:30]  The front seat.  Right.  He said back seat.  I never asked the question.  Right.  Okay.  He's got to knock her out.  He's got to bang her head against the door.  Right.  Get her out of the car.  Right?  What happened to the food?  She was knocked out.  She don't know.  I'm a detective.  We're back live.  No.  Now, Patrice, what's your take on that?  Dude, I learned a great word in my life called sophistry.  Yeah.  And it's senseless sense.  It's basically something that is horse shit, but it makes sense. 
[01:18:00]  You know he's full of shit, but when he said, where's the food, it was as dumb as it was,  but you go, I get it, but still, who gives a fuck?  Right.  This is where y'all fucked up.  Okay.  Let's make sense out of that question, but where's the food?  What difference did it make, Larry?  What was the next level of the investigation? 
[01:18:30]  If you was the detective and asked where the food was, what the fuck would that mean?  I think he's trying to trip her up, saying like, because his lawyer and himself was saying  that the guy was innocent, he's trying to trip her up, like, all right, well, he did  all this, so what happened to the food then?  He moved the food.  Exactly.  The food was probably all over the floor of the car.  He fucked me on top of the pudding.  Right.  Yeah.  Yes.  He was, as I was sucking his dick by force, he was hitting me in the back of the head  with a fresh loaf of bread. 
[01:19:00]  And I think anyone would assume that.  He was matching a grapefruit in my face and going, maah, suck my dick, bitch.  Maah.  My bananas ended up on his heels.  And I think anyone would assume that.  And he slid away.  He slid.  He was eating potato chips as he was raping.  Like, what is his...  That question had to have been asked, because everyone assumed the food just went all over  the place.  That was horse shit.  Because he's not a detective.  He's an interviewer.  And he fucking had no reason to say that, except for he's an old man who, he was probably 
[01:19:30]  interviewing with his chin in his hand, and he just was like...  Dozing off.  Thinking about the food.  And the last thing he heard was the food.  So it's like, what happened to the food?  Where'd it go?  But he's been around long enough that he spun it right back at us.  It was genius.  Now you understand how people who can think a guy is so inept could be on the air for  80 years, and basically without incident.  Right.  And have kids at 80.  And fucking, he goes, well, and you go, wait a minute, wait. 
[01:20:00]  Give me two seconds to tell you you're full of shit.  He was great.  He went with everything yesterday.  Talked about how he was married.  I asked him about being married eight times.  And he said he'd probably in his whole life only been in love maybe three times.  And that when he was married, like there were times where he was going into his wedding  and just knew this was horse shit and wasn't going to work.  He sounded sharp and funny, though, man.  He was extremely sharp.  Not the guy we got to know at the end of his career. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What's that picture of him being arrested?  What happened there?  That's a classic.  That's been around a while.  That's from, I guess, 1971?  Mm-hmm.  What was he arrested for?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  The other thing.  Stealing food from a rape victim.  And the other thing.  So Sam asked him in the 10 o'clock hour or right after the appearance about the skateboard  dude.  Right.  That was our second biggest, like, horse shit question.  Oh, we don't have the original clip?  The one I remember that was weird to me was the Sharon Tate hole. 
[01:21:00]  Sharon Tate thing.  Oh, man.  The Sharon Tate one.  That one got to me.  That one was like, wow.  That was a man that so brutally murdered your sister.  It's like, well, he never murdered my sister.  What are you talking about?  Oh, what I meant.  And then his explanation of what he meant was such horse shit.  But he's Teflon.  Some people are amazingly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would say Bill O'Reilly's one of those people, too.  You just can't.  You can't get.  You can't get him.  Get anything on him.  You just can't get him.  Yeah.  You want to get him, but you can't. 
[01:21:30]  And I think Larry is put a lot more into being able to come up with excuses for what he does  than what he does.  And he comes off, too, like this guy you don't want to bother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, this Dan Rather kind of fatherly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why are you going to do that?  And he's probably sitting there.  He's probably very happy because Pierce, what's his name?  He's tanking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ratings aren't good for Pierce.  No.  Not good.  Yeah.  Not good.  Like, I don't know.  I think he's too English.  Yeah.  People don't want to hear that shit. 
[01:22:00]  They don't want to hear English shit.  Stick to telling people they can't sing.  You ever watch CNN or MSNBC or any of these news stations when they go to the, like, British  fucking bureau for, like, an hour?  It's like news from England.  Yeah.  I don't know why they do that.  And it's like...  It's all about America.  And the subways are looked after.  There's a man down there with a machine gun.  He's making sure nothing happens.  And you're like, I can't listen to this guy's cadence is pissing me off.  We're just trying to...  Him doing that interview show is like... 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, it's just...  It's all right.  It's...  Blimey.  I watched it a couple of times.  It's just all right.  It's just there.  I think Larry had a factor.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's great to see a guy who used to tell people they ain't shit.  Yeah.  Be not shit.  You know, himself.  And just to say, oh, shit.  I'm really...  My talent was just telling people that they weren't talented.  Right, right.  Or was.  Because now he's in the shine and it's just tanking because people are like...  And I don't think... 
[01:23:00]  You know, but who knows?  Because I think, you know, America...  This is why I'm quitting, you know, comedy.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm on the way out.  Done?  It's the fact...  You know, I watched Bin Laden.  Of course, we all...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, there's the conspiracy...  What they call conspiracy nuts.  Yeah.  And there's whatever.  And the thing that gets me is that when there is one little question that makes you go, what?  What?  Uh-huh.  That we don't galvanize and say, no, no, no. 
[01:23:30]  You're not allowed to say anything else till we cover this.  Give me a...  Oh, right, right.  Give me a straight answer.  A straight answer because flushing Bin Laden down the ocean like he's cocaine from the Goodfellas.  You don't feel that that was...  It reeks of cover-up.  It doesn't prove anything.  You know, somebody like Hannity to make me sound like a complete idiot if I went on the show and went, 
[01:24:00]  he flushed him down in the fucking ocean.  It's just you go, there's nothing that just makes you...  That makes you go, what?  Does it just reek of cover-up of something?  But it does.  Yeah.  But how do...  Here's my...  Can we focus one day on one issue that bothers us as a country in terms of this whole...  Okay, let's say...  But they'll never answer it.  So, let's say this.  Whatever news you follow, because what it is is, okay, I listen to Fox or listen to CNN 
[01:24:30]  or listen to the conspiracy guys, which is, you know, my source of news.  Sure.  So, there has to be something where we go, okay, let's take out all the fucking shit, right?  And just concentrate on...  And let's concentrate on our own logic, in our own scenario.  And in anyone's scenario, do you fucking throw Bin Laden in the ocean?  In any of your own scenarios? 
[01:25:00]  I love Patrice's take on this.  Not the news is telling you this, because Fox will just go...  The difference to me between, like, the Alex Joneses, the Webster Tarpleys, the fucking  Farrakhan, and Alan Watt.  Those are the four guys I get my news from.  Yeah.  Okay?  There's always a way for you to go, fuck you, and then you go look it up.  Yeah.  It's always that.  It's historical.  The regular news does not allow you to fuck with history. 
[01:25:30]  If you see people that go, the Gulf of Tonkin!  People go, Danny dismisses that.  Yeah, yeah.  Shh!  That's not the issue, Gulf of Tonkin!  Suck a dick!  But there's no weapons of mass destruction.  We're there for nothing.  Shut up!  You don't support the troops!  And you're just babbling.  But you go, wait a fucking minute!  The Gulf of Tonkin's fake!  We died!  The motherfuckers died!  It was fake! 
[01:26:00]  But they go, suck my dick.  So, the thing about the quote-unquote conspiracy guys, you can go fuck you and go look that  shit up and go, holy shit.  This shit, this happened, it was fake.  So, my thing is, okay, fuck listening to people.  Now, just go with your own fucking mentality.  There's a lot of things that's going wrong with this bin Laden shit.  Now, what's your take on the whole thing of the Muslims have to be fucking disposed of 
[01:26:30]  Now, whatever it is, in a day.  Let me tell you something.  If you Google any criminal, babyface Nelson, there's a picture of a guy that shot him in  his face, taking a look at what the fuck I did shot.  You're right, yeah.  Bonnie and Clyde, that bitch, they will never show a bitch dead, but you go, Bonnie and  Clyde, bullets all in her face. 
[01:27:00]  And fucking, G-Man is out there.  And G-Man, you know what I mean?  With a Tommy gun.  With a Tommy gun.  Like, so.  Break it down, what do you think happened?  This is.  Break it down.  In conspiracy world.  Right.  Okay.  No, in Patrice's world.  But this is, I get a lot of my shit, in my world, okay, what do I believe?  You're a thinker, yes.  I believe.  All right, here we go.  But I don't have any fucking endorsements to lose, so I'll just say it. 
[01:27:30]  I believe, and this is the thing, you can't prove it, I believe that he had lent himself  that Bin Laden, because this is the history of it.  We were in cahoots.  We're in cahoots with everybody.  And this is why Muslims hate America.  Not because of we living in America and live how we want to live and do radio.  Living in America. 
[01:28:00]  Very good.  Out of high.  Say, well, living in America, living in America.  They can't hate that song.  They got to dance to that fucking song.  Oh, you love that song.  Because there's no song that they do that's better than living in America.  Me, not me, here.  Really?  Me, not me, here is better than living in America.  Rocky's fucking working out to it.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Here we go.  Yeah.  This is fucking great.  You can't hate.  You can't hate on this song. 
[01:28:30]  Let's not bomb today.  Let's listen to this.  Enjoy.  Because I enjoy living in America myself.  We don't like Americans.  We want to kill them.  But all this song, James Brown.  Ow.  Ow.  Day-day-day-day-day.  Living in America.  Ow.  Ow.  The reason they hate us is because we support the evil regimes that, so Egypt and all these 
[01:29:00]  dictators who suppress their people, we help them.  Right.  We make sure that they stay in power.  So that's why they hate us, first of all.  I think, and listen, there's a new Bin Laden that they're already setting up, this guy that  had dinner at the White House.  Al Asari or something.  He's the new.  He's had dinner at the White House?  Yeah, they've been talking about it.  He had dinner at the White House like in 2002.  Because he was one of the good ones.  Now he's the next Bin Laden, this guy from Yemen.  I think it's Al Asari or something. 
[01:29:30]  I think Bin Laden was in cahoots with them a long time.  I think he was getting sick.  I think they needed a war.  And I think that he, they set him up in this compound, okay?  And let him live his last days out, be in the face of evil.  Mm-hmm.  I think he died somewhere.  Because who's to prove that he wasn't?  They fucking caught him and threw him in the ocean.  Like I said, like how you would flush cocaine down the toilet when the cops kick in your fucking door. 
[01:30:00]  We needed that terrorist, Karen.  Karen!  Karen!  How could you flush the line?  They wouldn't have found him.  We needed that terrorist.  I'm sorry!  Do you understand?  He was the only bad guy we had!  What I'm saying, this is all conjecture, but I'm saying what I believe.  So it was just time to tell the world that he was dead.  It was time.  And it was time for Obama because he's not done yet. 
[01:30:30]  His mission ain't done.  And this helped him a lot.  They didn't count on something that I knew about.  But why would he?  Is that white racism is more powerful than he thought it fucking was.  Really?  So now he has to almost become Bush.  Yeah, he is kind of slipping.  Gun-ho, and we killed the motherfucker.  And that white racism you're correct about because his poll numbers only went up a tiny bit after that. 
[01:31:00]  Because I heard some shit.  If that happened with George W., his fucking ratings would have went for the roof.  They would have made sure that you could do four terms as the president.  I think Obama only went up three, maybe four points.  Because white racism is a lot more, it's deep, man.  And so I think, personally, they needed a face to this.  Okay?  He not only was public enemy number one.  People would argue he was next to Hitler in terms of his cachet. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  Yep.  Of what he wanted to do.  Yeah.  Of his evil.  Evil.  Evil.  So you go, look, I think he was a sick old man.  I think he died a long time ago.  Or he died in that place.  They staged that shit.  Plastic, he's dead.  So Obama could get elected.  They're going to put another guy in.  And here's one of the things, one of the guys, Webster Tarpley, who I like.  Like him.  He's just one of those machines. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Those conspiracy.  But he's a historian, though.  He goes, look.  And he said this shit in 2007.  He said, I'm nervous about this guy because, see, the thing about Bush, and they call it the neocons.  The thing about Bush, he was a cowboy.  He was like, we're going to go in there and fucking bomb him.  Fuck him.  But Obama's not that kind of guy.  So basically what he's saying is, look, the people he worked for, which is the beggars, okay, they want, Britain and America wants to keep power. 
[01:32:30]  They want this white people to be powerful.  I tell people this.  They're not going to let brown people rule the world.  They'll destroy it first, these white bankers, man.  So basically this guy, fucking Brzezinski, who is the face, he's the puppet master.  He wants to stop China and Russia.  And if he can, he wants to pit them against each other to destroy each other.  And what they would do is now they're talking about going to Pakistan. 
[01:33:00]  They start in trouble with Pakistan.  Yeah.  Because how could you harbor this guy?  What they're going to do with that is take Pakistan so they can strategically have things.  They want to control Pakistan because Pakistan's friendly with China.  Well, wouldn't Pakistan have said something like, hey, by the way, this guy's been dead for fucking years.  We know it.  But they have.  Wait, wait.  You remember this lady that got fucking the prime minister of Pakistan? 
[01:33:30]  It was a woman?  Yeah.  She said, oh, she goes, what was the guy with the fucked up head look like?  The guy they caught, and he was in a t-shirt, and he was all.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They caught him, and he was a big timer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She says out loud, this lady, fucking her name.  The prime minister, she was murdered in 2007.  Right.  She said, Ben Laden's dead.  He was killed by something.  We could see that online?  Yeah, absolutely.  She said, Ben Laden's dead.  She was dead. 
[01:34:00]  After she said that.  They murdered that bitch.  Let me go with what answer.  Hold on.  Let me go with what Ant said, though.  I mean, the Republicans and the Democrats fucking, at this point, hate each other.  So why wouldn't there be a Republican saying, look, I know the deal here.  Fuck that.  Osama's been dead for years.  Why would they tell us the truth?  I don't know.  No, the Republicans, to get a little foothold on the power thing.  Because they're in cahoots.  Wait, wait, wait.  They're in cahoots.  I have an open mind here. 
[01:34:30]  So the Republicans and the Democrats, as they show on TV, they fucking basically can't get along and hate each other.  They're actually in cahoots behind the scenes.  It's staged.  It's the bank runs the fucking show.  It's divide and conquer.  That's why they need racism.  That's why anybody who ever comes close ever to galvanizing the people.  Yeah.  They get murdered.  They, people, Martin Luther King was dangerous because he had white people going, wow, this is, hmm, this is, wow. 
[01:35:00]  And he was doing it out of love.  But Rock did it because it was, they need, the next thing they're going to do is, if you notice, they do a lot of shit in Africa.  Uh-huh.  It's the Sudan.  Yeah.  It's under, it's under the, under peace.  But Sudan gives China, uh, evidently.  I just get my reports.  I'm just going, I didn't go over there and test the fucking oil.  But supposedly, Sudan gives China a lot of oil, maybe a third of its oil.  So we got to go in these places to take these places. 
[01:35:30]  That's why dictators are so important to us.  Because we can't fuck with a democracy.  Right.  We need Pakistan to have a dictator so we can say, hey, do this, motherfucker.  Well, that's why we pay him $3 billion.  Exactly.  That's why we hate as a country, we're supposed to hate Ahmadinejad from Iran and, and, uh, uh, the motherfucker from down, uh, South America.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, Chavez.  Chavez, right. 
[01:36:00]  Because they, they're dictators who actually look out for their people.  They're not corrupt.  Why can't we turn them?  Because they're not corrupt.  They say, fuck America.  And they work with China.  Because China has just as much power as we do.  We are horrified of fucking China.  Yeah.  So what we're trying to do is get, somehow get a foothold and have a standing army and get control of any place where the oil, where people can go fuck America and sell their oil to China. 
[01:36:30]  We want to control those places so that then China has to then fight with Russia to get their oil from, like, Siberia or if the Saudis want to deal with them, they just make it so it's a, because China needs oil.  So how come all these conspiracies pretty much come back for, for the past, for many years now to oil, yet we are fucked with oil and paying through the nose and, and we never have enough. 
[01:37:00]  And it's like, is that part of the point?  But here's the thing that gets me.  I think it's an easy answer.  Yeah.  They don't give a fuck.  Like, about any of us.  Oh, yeah.  And the reason that they don't, they didn't, look it, don't forget, I buy a lot of sneakers.  Here's the pimp game.  I think I might as well said, the pimp game is this.  Whatever you're into buying, okay, I remember my sneakers were $30.  Yeah.  You buy a sneaker for $30, and I remember my mother bought me a pair of sneakers for $30, and she was like, damn. 
[01:37:30]  Then what they do is they hit you with the $60, right after the $30.  You go, oh, Lord, I can't afford sneakers no more.  So, just when you're getting ready, they find out who got money and who don't, they lower it back down to $40.  Uh-huh.  So, you go, oh, I can buy sneakers.  But they just bumped it up $10.  Gas in 2003 was $0.99 a gallon. 
[01:38:00]  It's $4 now.  Why didn't they just bump it up to $4?  Because we would revolt.  Right, right.  But now it's a slow fucking.  You just do it slowly.  The slow burn.  They just have the appreciation to know people enough that people want it with Vaseline.  You know what I'm saying?  So, they slip it in slow, and you go, okay, okay, okay, okay.  And they take it out.  So, pretty much everything is a lie.  Everything's a lie.  And so, how does this lie perpetuate without somebody really coming out and leaking it? 
[01:38:30]  They do.  But we dismiss them.  Anybody who says, hey, this is the anti-idea of what happened.  Like, people, look, here's the problem.  The problem is they're willing.  They have a term.  It's called.  They have two terms for what we're dealing with now.  Yeah.  One is blowback.  The other term is what we all know, which is collateral damage.  Why would you even invent a fucking term called collateral damage, which is innocent people die? 
[01:39:00]  Basically, hey, this number of innocent people, this number of innocent people die so that we can, what's the word I'm looking for?  It's innocent.  How do you?  It's like, okay, this many people, they calculate it.  It's really the cost of doing business.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We've heard that over the years.  They're expendable.  I don't want to get past the Osama thing.  Okay, okay.  Al-Qaeda comes out and says he's dead. 
[01:39:30]  So, what's that about then?  Al-Qaeda supposedly, and this is what you believe, this is why.  But why wouldn't they have said, look, we all know he was dead years ago.  Because they, Al-Qaeda, and this is where it starts to sound crazy.  Right.  It's CIA created, CIA run.  Bin Laden fought Russia for us.  The whole story about him going, fuck you, that's what they told us. 
[01:40:00]  But Al-Qaeda was created and funded by fucking America.  So, what was it for Osama?  Yeah, but it wasn't that outrageous back then.  A bunch of fucking money.  Yeah, but then he had to live the rest of his life in kind of shitty terms.  But he was dying anyway.  That's what they showed us.  Did they show him with his legs crossed chilling in that compound?  That's what they said.  This is what I'm saying.  It's just what they say.  I don't think he was living much better than that.  Dude, he was chilling.  They show you the footage that's kind of shitty.  Hold the phone.  Hold the phone here. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  The Russian thing.  Obviously, it's like, yeah, we go, the CIA was funding Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda.  It's the same people when they were the, what, Mujahideen or whatever it was, when they were fighting the Russians.  But, yeah, that isn't, why do people think that's so outrageous?  They, sometimes our allies become our enemies and vice versa.  Okay.  Back then, we hated the fucking Russians.  Yeah, we still do.  We wanted to fuck with them.  They wanted to fuck with us.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:41:00]  So, whenever they got involved in some military action, we supported the opposing team.  Okay.  Which, at that point, was Bin Laden and the rest of the people in, uh, have freedom fighters in Afghanistan.  Uh, then things changed.  There is no more Soviet Union.  So, we became the bad guys.  And, of course, now they're, they're going to come after us.  Uh, so what, why is that so unbelievable?  No, I don't, I don't not believe it.  I don't even not believe that.  I don't, I'm, I'm, this is, it's, it's what I go with is, like, what makes sense. 
[01:41:30]  Now, some of it, you go, like, look, I don't believe in aliens.  I don't believe in this thing where they're trying to get us to believe aliens, because  NASA just released them.  Yeah, I'm not, I'm not with it, but I'm going to say, if you tell me two plus two is four,  and I know it is, but then you shove marbles in your ass, and I go, Jesus, Anthony shoves  marbles in his ass?  That doesn't discredit two plus two is four. 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  So, I, I'll let motherfuckers, to, to fight this battle, and I'm going to tell you, if  you, if you know Alex Jones, or if you know Alan Watt, if you listen to Farrakhan, if you  listen to Webster Tarpley, all four of those dudes have the tenacity of crazy.  Right.  And you need that tenacity.  But it doesn't necessarily mean what they're saying is bullshit.  I have the tenacity of crazy, because you need that, because I do comedy, and I see  the faces, the faces of people who just go out and party when they announce Bin Laden's 
[01:42:30]  dead.  The puppets.  The sheep.  Those are people, a lot of those people come to comedy shows, and it makes it difficult to  communicate, because you can say something that just will make somebody turn on you.  But I, if you, this is the one thing that opened my mind up that I'd never move off of.  The Federal Reserve Bank ain't federal.  It, it fucked me up to know that we pay a private loan by a private bank to our government 
[01:43:00]  who doesn't borrow money based on our wishes.  We are fucking slaves to the bank, and everything else is believable.  Once they tell you that the gold standard, do you know what our standard is now?  How we, how we, we weigh our wealth?  It's a debt standard. 
[01:43:30]  Debt!  If you owe me a thousand, I'm worth a thousand.  Yes.  But it's not, it's not real!  Let me ask you a question about the Alex Joneses of the world, and I hate using that term, but,  because there's a bunch of them you named.  Uh, aren't they bad for the plant?  Yeah, but...  So why doesn't the government do a little, uh, something, something with them?  Because they're...  Because they're putting marbles up their ass.  Yes!  Thank you.  I understand what Patrice says.  Thank you.  If they say this shit, but they're so crazy when they're saying it, and so many people 
[01:44:00]  are like, oh, listen to this fucking guy, they can make the lie better by exposing it  and being crazy, because then you'd have to be crazy to believe it.  Let me go with that, then.  So why isn't there a guy that doesn't put the marbles up his ass saying the same shit?  They all...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Like that Pakistani woman?  Well, I'm gonna ask, and has there been a guy that didn't do it with putting the marbles  up his ass, and what happened to that guy?  Ready, though?  Oh, let me give you...  I'm talking about talk radio, not just... 
[01:44:30]  I know, wait, ready?  I'm not a crazy guy.  Hi.  Um, in about three years, aliens will be visiting us, and, um...  You just put marbles up your ass?  No matter...  I could go, motherfucker!  Aliens is coming, you bastards!  And you go, yes!  Then you go, you know, um...  I talked to God last night.  God said, we had a drink together.  And, uh, that nigga's crazy.  No matter what you say, that ain't regular, with the regular shit that the news is telling 
[01:45:00]  you and everything, you're crazy!  But you're saying it today, I don't know what I believe, I'm listening to you, and it's  very interesting, but you're saying it without putting marbles up your ass right now?  No, I'm not.  You're putting marbles up your ass?  I'm...  Yeah, because someone's getting mad, because here's the thing, here's something that I've  never said in public, I'm gonna say right now.  And it scares me, but at least I'm here and I can get a chance to say it correctly.  I'll never say it on Fox and stuff, because they'll just chop your head off and I'm evil. 
[01:45:30]  They always throw, so you don't support the troops!  And people get fucked up with that.  But I go, the troops are not an entity to be supported.  They do what they're told to do.  So, I'm not supporting anyone that gets killed in the line of duty, and go over there, and  in their mind, they're protecting me and your liberty. 
[01:46:00]  I'm saying that they don't do anything for you to support them.  They just do the bidding of the banks and the government, wherever they see fit.  So, if I say I don't support the troops, it's not saying, I don't support those people that  are dying.  You go, I don't support policy.  And for people, like on these newscats, to manipulate that, knowing that they're intelligent  people, and they put that at you, and they make you sound fucked up, you know that they 
[01:46:30]  are controlled by, because the banks own the networks, and they own propaganda, and they  own, so of course, if you take out the fact that you are racist, listen to Farrakhan.  When Farrakhan talks about the banking system, and what they do to the kids, he ain't talking  about black, and he cries, this motherfucker starts crying, and Alex Jones is losing his 
[01:47:00]  mind, because people won't.  But then Farrakhan puts marbles up his ass by talking about flying pyramids and fucking.  Yes, but he has told you, two plus two is four, you can pick up a book and go, two plus  two is four, but this motherfucker got marbles in his ass.  I love the marbles.  But two plus two is four, so you don't even have to really listen to him no more, all  you have to do is get your math book, and then go, wow, three times three is nine. 
[01:47:30]  But it turns out, but a lot of people think of it in terms of like a witness in a trial,  if you find any part of the testimony to be false, or you don't think there's any proof  of it, then you can throw out all the testimony.  Yeah, it's all conjecture.  We are repeating, I'm just basically parroting what I hear, and then with a little bit of  research.  And a little bit of your own intellect and experience.  But what do we know?  I believe we shot Osama.  I can't prove it. 
[01:48:00]  I just believe it.  Okay, let's say, let's cut out the news.  I just believe it.  I'm disappointed we didn't get to see the death shot.  Always.  Because it would shut up a lot of conspiracy guys, but the White House comes out and says,  well, they'll always not believe.  And his, this other, this girl, a friend of my woman, she goes, she was in the army.  Now the army's fucking her bad.  Won't give her GI Bill and shit.  Don't, you know.  So, she goes, uh, uh, she goes, well, if we didn't bury him, it would incite, incite 
[01:48:30]  what?  More anger?  Like, the fact that Al-Qaeda is supposedly threatening us now with violence, they weren't yesterday  before this motherfucker got shot?  And there'd be more threats of violence.  They hate us to the umpteenth level.  You're, you're, you're just, uh-oh.  Oh, Osama got killed.  Uh-oh.  They went to a level, oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  They was just gonna basically kill us.  But then, so they- 
[01:49:00]  But why raise suspicion in so many people?  Because it was a fucking cover update!  He's dead!  But you could find, you could find some kind of lookalike then at that point and show a  death photo of some guy.  Because people-  Because even if they released a death photo, people would have questions like, oh, that's  not him.  The sophistication of technology fucks up this game.  Yeah, but the government has shit.  They're trying-  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr says the government has shit we don't even know about yet.  Dude, I'm not talking about the shit we don't know about. 
[01:49:30]  Because, too-  LBJ had an iPad, but-  What I'm saying-  Hold on, hold on.  Okay.  Because Bill Burr made a great point.  He went to the Reagan Museum, wasn't it?  Yes.  Or the library out there in California, and they have a part of his plane, you know, Air  Force One, where they- it had a phone on it, way before this technology was available  for anybody else.  No, that's not my point, that they have all this technology.  They might have other technology.  Okay, good.  My point is this.  The fact that we have it-  Yeah.  Fucks them.  The internet-  That fucks their planet.  They are trying to destroy the internet. 
[01:50:00]  It fucks them up.  Photoshop fucks them up.  They can't treat you like complete dummies.  They did release a death photo, and motherfuckers went, this shit's photoshopped!  Oh, you think that was supposed to be the fucking death photo?  I mean, yes!  I love it.  God damn it, I've never heard that one before.  These are 80-year-old white guys who are fucking still-  So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Patricia.  Why do we still have the Milsson?  Hold on, hold on, please, please. 
[01:50:30]  Why do we still-  Wait, why the fuck, with all this technology, we still depend on a rating system that one  family is in control of 100,000?  It's bullshit.  Hold on, I gotta slow you down, because your point is so brilliant that I want to just  explore that a little bit.  So, you think the government kind of like, all right, let's just get this out there and  see if they-  Let's see what they-  Let's see how they buy it.  Oh, shit, someone found two pictures that we put together.  They looked at that shit.  And, and Obama's birth certificate. 
[01:51:00]  Motherfuckers.  Technology looked at that and went, what the fuck is this shit?  See, that's just funny.  It's so long.  So, if you-  I gotta take the other part of that, too.  Go ahead.  If the government's so powerful, they would just find some fucking Muslim that kind of  looks like him, and then kill that fucking guy, and then put that picture out there.  Really?  And then-  Why not?  Here's technology.  What happens then?  Oh, I'm looking at, uh, Valley Bertinelli.  Does it-  That doesn't-  That's not really that- 
[01:51:30]  Dude, technology fucks with the thing.  So, you think they threw that picture out hoping-  That was the picture.  Hoping we would buy it.  That was the death photo.  That was the picture.  And they thought they would just let, let us-  And this is the thing that kills me about Fox and all that.  They're not, they're not arguing.  They flushed them down the fucking ocean?  They're arguing, why didn't we get to see the death photos?  It's like, wait a minute, you're not questioning the fact that you had a Muslim burial for public 
[01:52:00]  enemy number two all time?  This is public-  If we-  Okay, do you think we would have just-  We still want to find Hitler.  We're still trying to find his bones-  Looking in South America or something.  Him and Ava Braun, who supposedly killed him, in speculation, do you think that they would just flush the, of our time, the worst motherfucker that ever was born, they would just throw him in the ocean? 
[01:52:30]  And under the guise of having a respectful Muslim burial, do you fucking believe that?  You believe that?  This is what I'm saying.  The frustration is, I can't move on.  Do you fucking believe that?  Right.  As a person.  Just as a person who doesn't have a television, if I told you that.  And I was, me and you was talking, no TV, and I go, yeah, man, Bin Laden, who's Bin Laden?  Yeah, this is a guy responsible. 
[01:53:00]  He killed 3,000 people, and he wants to kill millions, and he runs the most sinister terrorist  group ever created.  This guy may be on par, his intentions may be on par with Hitler.  Wow, this guy's fucking evil.  Found him, caught him, and killed him.  Whoa!  Great.  What did you do with the body?  Throw it in the water!  This is your new set, by the way.  I love the fact that-  Throw it in the water?  A thinking man's comedy. 
[01:53:30]  That's your new gig.  He's-  Yeah, but Danny says that-  Kind of turning me.  No, but Danny says that Death Floor's been around for a while.  So what's your take on that, Patrice?  Rehashed.  After-  That's what Danny says.  That's what-  See what I'm saying?  It's-  Well, then that's what you're saying.  That's what I'm talking about.  I dismiss, I discredit what Danny says.  And he just did that.  And he discredited me.  Who gives a fuck what Danny says?  And not because it's Danny, but because anything.  Anybody says anything, you could just say no.  Nope.  And people- 
[01:54:00]  And that's the simplicity of it.  And people are saying, why are we beating up Patrice like we do Troy?  Well, because Troy Kwan comes in here with questions, but doesn't give us any-  No, he gives us nothing.  Like, at least Patrice is giving us some stuff to think about.  Patrice has-  That's the difference, by the way.  I can't go to that guy on the phones right now.  He has 15 levels of involvement with every subject he brings up.  He could peel away the layers.  He explains what he's talking about.  But when you get somebody that comes in and just goes, yeah, the Pentagon was hit with a missile.  How? 
[01:54:30]  Explain that when there were plane parts.  No, there weren't.  No, I was hit by a missile.  You believe in everything the government says?  It's like, but when Patrice explains things like, look, why the fuck would they take the biggest fucking criminal of our time and just throw his body away without anyone seeing it?  Like his cocaine.  No one saw it.  Like evidence that you'd get thrown away.  And they threw it away without at least-  Now, think about this also.  It does bother me.  They took Jeffrey Dahmer after he was killed and examined his brain to see abnormalities and maybe things that could be worked on in the future. 
[01:55:00]  Wouldn't you want to check out Bin Laden's brain and see if there were abnormalities?  Why didn't they do an autopsy?  Hey, did he have those kidney problems?  Let's cut them open and maybe see if this guy had some kind of physical, mental problem.  Have you heard this on Fox?  What are you saying?  No, I haven't heard it.  Have you heard it on CNN?  No.  They just wrapped him up and flushed him down the ocean.  Like what you said, flushed him down the ocean.  I love flushed him down the ocean.  Here come the cops. 
[01:55:30]  Here come nosy people with their bullshit.  Quick, get them in the drink.  Oh, man.  I'm just saying.  You're getting me thinking, Patricia.  That's all it is.  And then you just go and you just look at basically.  I think the government gave you diabetes.  They don't like this power you got.  Nigga, if they want to get rid of me, I'd rather have AIDS and drop dead than have this shit.  Because diabetes has to be government.  AIDS ain't.  Government.  Diabetes.  Because diabetes is hilarious. 
[01:56:00]  Because if you say I'm dying of sugar, it just makes you smile.  It's like, aw.  What a sweet way to go.  If a fuck virus makes you scared to death.  It makes you creepy.  I'm dying of something that invades your body and destroys everything.  Makes you go, oh.  And I catch it by fucking.  But to go, hey, man.  If you eat a lollipop, things go bad.  Bubble gum?  Really?  So it's, you know, maybe so.  It doesn't sound that bad.  We really got a break.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  We got Laszlo outside the studio.  Yes, Laszlo. 
[01:56:30]  We also had the Larry King thing.  Should we play it here or just save that?  Eh, might as well save it.  Just save it for another time?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah.  Patrice, you plugging anything?  I'm in Florida at, oh, shit.  I'm sorry, man.  If you make it.  Jesus fucking government.  Big mama prods on Twitter.  You'll be tweeting it, Jace, I'm sure.  Wait.  Marcos Island.  Oh, Marcos Island.  Oh, right.  Okay.  That gig.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you guys do that gig.  Oh, that place?  Sure.  Sounds like a blast.  I haven't ever been there, but I'll get the name. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, we'll get it.  We'll get it out there.  But look at me, you want to see Patrice.  It's been a while.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Laszlo next.  Stay there.  This is the Virus Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Patrice is for you.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Big mama prods on Twitter.  Hey, hey. 
[01:57:30]  Really quickly, because we pissed off Chicago.  You know, we kind of just threw the Bulls to the side there.  The Heat are going to have a tough time with the Bulls.  Yes, they are.  All right.  And you will acknowledge that, right?  Yes.  Yes, they.  Because you said the Heat will win the whole fucking thing.  And then we got Chicago yelling at us, saying, what the fuck?  Our team.  I guess I did not know this, so I'm just repeating this.  But I guess the Bulls swept the Heat during the regular season.  Yeah, but that was when the Heat were trying to figure out what they're going to do.  Still trying to get their shit together?  And here's the thing. 
[01:58:00]  The Bulls have Derrick Rose, and the next best player is Carlos Boozer.  Right.  So they have a super player, meaning he's at the level of a stratospheric guy.  He's in a rarefied atmosphere, as they say.  Derrick Rose.  But their next best guy is Boozer, offensively.  And they're going against three guys who were the A-list guys, the go-to guys on their team,  plus two relatively good big men, three great three-point shooters, and an older point guard who's good enough. 
[01:58:30]  These guys, Miami's better.  Fuck.  They're better.  They're not good.  Chicago, but this is why I hope to God Boston just sits everybody down and goes out like the, you know,  just old-school guys fade away, because then they have Chicago next.  And please, no disrespect to Atlanta, because Atlanta ain't bums.  They're another long, lanky, young team. 
[01:59:00]  This is why the Celtics just need to just go and relax with the Lakers and just go, boy, remember those days?  And just dismantle the team.  Because this is serious shit going on.  I mean, they're just young animals, man.  You got tough years ahead of you being a Celtics fan.  Yeah, because we have Rondo, but there's nothing else on the horizon.  Rondo's got a fucked-up elbow.  That'll heal up.  How the fuck was he playing like that?  He's trying to, you know, he's a legacy.  We're going to seg into this. 
[01:59:30]  This fucking game looks good.  I love these.  We got Laszlo in studio.  Laszlo!  I have to say, I saw.  You just got us out of basketball talk, because I looked up and said, this fucking game looks good.  Yeah, it's L.A. Noire.  Yeah, it comes out a week from today.  From Rockstar Games.  For everybody?  Yes, for everybody.  Damn it.  Where's our copy?  I wanted a copy.  We don't even have press copies yet.  They're still being stamped out.  Oh, okay. 
[02:00:00]  This game is so big, it was almost four discs on the Xbox.  It's three discs.  Holy shit.  And there's still DLC.  Oh, man.  And look at the actors you have.  Who's the guy?  Who played the lawyer in The Godfather?  Yeah, yeah.  What's his name?  It looked like, uh...  Is this...  Who's the lawyer from The Godfather?  Oh, fuck.  You got a lot of stars.  I saw some fucking computer pussy.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, that's the Black Dahlia kind of thing going on.  Yeah, so these are real crimes from the 1940s in Los Angeles that you go to. 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  So we got a lot of actors that you might recognize.  There's a ton of people from Mad Men.  And it's this new facial scanning technology called Motion Scan.  That's fucked up.  That's what I'm saying.  They got fucking actors in this bitch room.  And you can see, like...  You can see every...  Robert Duvall, it looks like.  Robert Duvall.  Robert Duvall, that guy.  And who's the little bald dude that's really good?  He always plays a character actor.  The little bald dude.  I know, I know.  What's the fucking...  His big thing, he played Pig Vomit.  Oh, Giamatti.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Paul Giamatti.  Paul Giamatti is...  That's Paul Giamatti, the first guy.  Right?  Or no?  Is that him?  Did you get his face, or...?  Oh, shit.  You got fucking William Shatner?  That's not William Shatner.  This is amazing.  Michael Madsen, I saw, I think.  What the...  James Cromwell?  You have...  Well, the thing is, it's a...  Yeah, let's go back to Lazlo's.  It's a detective thriller.  So, basically...  What were you saying about the face thing?  With the facial technology being this advanced, you can actually do a detective game where 
[02:01:30]  you interrogate witnesses, and you're sort of looking for tells if they're full of shit.  Ah, like their eyes darting back and forth or something.  So, right now, Thanh is searching a naked woman's dead, mutilated corpse for clues.  Feel her tits.  Yeah, search her tits, man.  I think I saw something under her tits.  Fuck BDT.  She's got fuck you, BD.  Yeah, this is called the red lipstick murder.  So, you go to crime scenes, you look around for clues, you hold up props, you keep a notebook  of different things, and then when you interrogate people, you can point to stuff in your notebook, 
[02:02:00]  because if they're talking shit, you can say, yeah, but what about this crowbar that  we found on the site?  Different things like that.  And then the face will change depending on how you go about it.  And you can press buttons whether you believe them, doubt them, or you can accuse them.  The thing is, if you go after somebody too hard, they might clam up and not give you any  clues that'll help you solve the case.  Motherfuckers.  And you can always...  Can you work them over?  You can.  I'm just gonna work everyone over. 
[02:02:30]  Did you call this an RPG?  It is, it is, it does have sort of RPG elements, but, you know, I've played some RPGs where  I don't feel like I'm going anywhere besides talking to aliens, but in this, and sometimes  you start to, you know, question somebody, and they'll just run the fuck out of the room  and you gotta chase them down and beat them a bit.  That's hilarious.  Oh, man.  And this is in-game right now?  Yeah, this is all in-game footage, so...  Get the fuck out of it.  It's amazing, fucking rockstar, man.  It's hard for people to kind of wrap their heads around, they're like, well, is this 
[02:03:00]  just one big cutscene?  It's like, no, the capture technology is so good, it all feels like, you know...  Yeah, look at his fingernails, they're like, kind of clipped weird.  How long was this in development?  Six years.  Six years, wow.  Six years.  Patrice, I have to say, when I saw you at Caroline's last, probably the most uncomfortable  I've ever seen a room, when you went after that white suburban couple, do you remember  this?  Patrice just disarms people, where they're just in front of a crowd, admitting shit, 
[02:03:30]  and there was this white couple with their teenage son, and he starts...  He motherfucked the black guy.  He starts going into this, just asking her questions, and then all of a sudden, it's  like, give her sleep with the black guy before you slept with him, and she says yes, and  the teenage son goes loud as hell, what?  And the whole place just went...  And the kid was fucking looking daggers at Patrice for the rest of the show.  It was fucking uncomfortable. 
[02:04:00]  Patrice was laughing, so I thought you were going to fall off the stage.  His mother took a fat one, man.  Everybody thinks their mother's precious, but they're not.  They took ten toes up in the air, baby.  Everybody's mother.  Oh, shit.  I remember that, too.  It was fucking good.  I have to say, your DVD was quite nice.  Thank you, Lazlo.  I picked it up.  Patrice hit a home run with that.  It didn't get him famous, though, unfortunately.  No, but... 
[02:04:30]  He was going for fame with that thing.  I really was.  So now he's back on our fucking show.  I think the most...  Not the most, but one interesting thing about this game is the person that's playing it.  Yes.  Nathaniel.  Well, this is good.  Hi, Than.  Hi, guys.  You work from Rockstar?  You work from Rockstar?  Why?  Can I...  Yes, thank you.  I wanted to yell at somebody who works here for once.  Yeah.  Than works at Rockstar.  That's correct.  What are you doing?  He's playing games.  He's one of our gameplay capture artists. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, so I helped make all the trailers and the screenshots you've seen.  Stuff like that.  Is that an upgrade from this show when you was fucking on?  Believe me, anything's an upgrade from this show.  Was it really?  If he was fucking...  Hey, Than.  Do you have some fucking...  Like, do you have some, like, nervousness where you're trying to, like, keep your confidence  when you came in here, but it's like, oh, shit.  It's these idiots.  Oh, man.  A little nervous.  Is he a little nervous?  Oh, you mean coming back on air?  Yeah, you're like, just like, oh, shit, I'm back here, you know.  A little, but, you know, I got a nice job now. 
[02:05:30]  And he's like, I'm driving a car, so fuck you, motherfucker.  I'm solving a crime.  He's running the game.  So do you guys...  Wow.  Did somebody finish the game?  Like, I mean, did someone sit and play this game and go do it, someone at Rockstar?  Well, we have the QA department.  I mean, they play the game all day long trying to bust it.  But Than is a member of our production team.  We've got seven guys.  All they do is play the game and try to capture badass-looking shots out of it for our trailer. 
[02:06:00]  But there's a team of guys that will do nothing but try to fuck the game up, like, drive into  a weird alleyway.  And if the car goes in there and gets stuck, they've got to fix that.  So there's people that just fuck the game up.  Some games don't fix that shit.  No, the games are bugs.  This is amazing.  It really is.  It looks great, man.  And I will have to say, though, that after Than left this show, he was a bit on the skids  because I found his ass literally on a bridge when I went for a run. 
[02:06:30]  Jump?  No, I found it.  It was on the Manhattan Bridge all sweaty.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Are you being serious, man?  I don't even know if Lazlo's being serious.  That's the least kind way of describing it.  He was unemployed.  Gentlemen, what can I get?  Why was he sweating on a bridge?  Because instead of working, he was running in 110 degree heat.  I think I would rather have jumped off the bridge than to have Lazlo have to owe him my life. 
[02:07:00]  As he fucking tells me, I was a...  I found this fat fucker at a donut shop.  Lazlo...  Focus for this game a little bit more, man.  So you play this...  The character you play is Cole Phelps.  It's Aaron Stanton from Mad Men.  And you've recently come back from the war, from WW2.  Ah, the big one.  And so you're sort of...  The character's kind of fighting some demons, but he's come to L.A. to be a cop.  And throughout the game, you rise through the ranks of the department of the LAPD. 
[02:07:30]  So you started traffic.  You do arson.  You do vice.  And you solve all these individual cases, but it leads to the bigger storyline in the game.  Whether, you know, there's a mass murderer around.  And it's got some pretty interesting plot twists.  But as you can see here, Than's about to interrogate somebody.  Now look at the facial expressions.  That's fucked up.  Hey, Than, can you pause that just a quick second? 
[02:08:00]  Let me ask you this.  Now, during the development, did you guys make decisions on like, hey, you know what?  Maybe we should have a couple of shootouts or something.  Like some, you know, a shootout.  Like that turns it from the RPG thing to just like a little bit of...  Well, yeah, we tried to make it a nice combination of action, but also sort of like an intellectual kind of thought-provoking thriller where you have to pay attention to people's faces, their body movements, you know, sort of keeping track of different clues that you find. 
[02:08:30]  It's definitely a departure from other games that we've done.  It's a great way to use that technology because the facial capture is un-fucking-believable.  Jacob, her husband, we go way back.  She was here last night?  Sure, she's a regular.  So you're trying to tell here if he's full of shit or if he's just emotionally upset.  I'd say he's full of shit! 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, when I first...  I wouldn't believe anyone in the game.  Of course not.  Fuck this guy, guilty!  Yeah, you just don't want to feel like the asshole that believed him.  Yeah, yeah, fuck it.  Now, is it different endings?  Can you...  Yeah, so, depending on how well you interrogate people.  Um...  You know, there's some clues that may or may not open up.  It will take you longer to solve each specific self-contained case.  You can replay them at the end of each case.  Uh-huh.  This is a murder beef, McCole.  You don't want any adverse publicity for this place, do you? 
[02:09:30]  Uh-oh.  If I had names, I would give them to you.  I like Celine.  I don't believe this guy.  Yeah, I don't believe him.  See, you're just going to fucking start yelling at a cop?  Yeah!  You piece of shit, I'll kill you.  He's all pissed.  So this is the room that we did the motion scan in.  Wow, the motion capture.  Look at all those cameras.  Jesus Christ.  They're all high-def cameras.  The amount of data that it takes is insane.  Mrs. Henry appears.  And how much work did the actors have to do?  Well, a lot, because first you have to do the walk around in the bodysuit, and then 
[02:10:00]  you have to go in this room and wear, like, crazy, you know, clean clothes, booties, and  all this stuff, because everything is, like, a speck of dust can fuck the whole process up.  Holy shit!  And you're surrounded by these 32 cameras, and the lights are intense, you know.  To get the air conditioning to cool the room down was a bit of a scene, and then you could  hear the air conditioner on the mic, and so then we had to do all this.  So it's constantly reinventing the way that we make games, and the way that we, you know, 
[02:10:30]  capture facial footage.  Now, when they're acting, I'm noticing there's no body movement.  They have to just move their face.  But they're watching the body movement that they did before, when they walked around in  the capture suit, and then they do the facial sitting down.  Now, that seems very difficult.  Holy shit!  The other issue is, so you shoot a bunch of scenes, and then you come back, because we  did about three different shoots, right?  And they were months apart. 
[02:11:00]  Well, you bring an actor back in, he's fucking gained weight, his hair's, you know, he's cut  his hair, and so now you've got to spend a ton of time in makeup and everything else.  We hired these makeup artists that know 1940s hairstyles really well.  So the women, the women in the game, their hair took fucking hours.  It was intense.  Wow, man.  Now, what game reminds, like, how do you, who's this marketed to, like, can you give me 
[02:11:30]  another game that was successful that's kind of like this, that you're marketing this to?  I don't know, I mean, people have said, you know, is it, like, heavy rain, is it, you  know, um...  So if it wasn't, Jacob...  It's kind of hard to say.  And what's the age he's playing this?  Because it seemed like an 18-year-old would go, would not be able to play this show.  Oh, it's rated M for mature.  So it's rated M for mature.  There's a lot of...  Asked him to come pick her up.  There's a lot of murder and mayhem.  It's a very dark, violent thriller. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  I think you'll get a little bit of an older demo than you would for, like, Grand Theft.  Just for the fact that I like the idea of solving problems and having to think things  out.  There's also some mini-games occasionally, you know, when you're on crime scenes, but you  start to really get into investigating these crime scenes and looking around for stuff,  and you pick up, there's hundreds of objects that you pick up and investigate in the game,  and you, like, look at picture frames, and, um...  Let's get out of here.  I think that guy's innocent, though. 
[02:12:30]  Do you think that guy...  You know why?  Because he cursed a cop out, so that means he's got nothing to hide.  He's like, fuck you, cop.  So where does he go now?  Well, he was given some clues from that guy.  He gave him a location.  Yeah.  So now...  Check out a new location.  So you've got to go to the Henry residence.  Oh, what are you running for?  He's just...  You know, we only have so much time on air, Ant.  He's running to a bridge.  Go get a gig. 
[02:13:00]  It was a little Grand Theft Auto he just did.  You know, a little run.  Yeah, a little run.  Sorry.  Can he fuck hookers and all that little side stuff?  No.  No side shit.  No hooker fucking in this one.  Boom.  A lot of people asking about your time on Ron and Fez just say, what happened yesterday?  I evidently confronted Fezzy about what he thinks about when he masturbates, and it just melted down.  Oh, no.  And then they accused me of trying to pull an opie and make him cry.  Pull an opie?  No.  The guy who's pulling an opie is Ron.  Yes.  And then I accused Ron of pulling the fucking strings on it, and then he's against me. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, of course.  Wow.  He's the puppet master, but no one wants to acknowledge that.  I know.  And he's like, why is everybody...  That's the new thing that accused me of being a...  I did time on Ron and Fez.  I was trying to get to know Fez a little bit, and he starts crying and thinks I purposely was trying to make him cry.  I just tried to ask him...  It's exhausting.  I tried to ask him some questions, and he freaked out.  I asked him about his fucking leukemia cancer testicular shit bracelet, whatever the fuck  those rubber things are that everybody wears, and he's like, I wasn't prepared to talk about  this.  I was like, sorry, dude.  He wasn't prepared to talk about it. 
[02:14:00]  Half the shit we talk about, we're not prepared to talk about.  Everything we talk about.  Yeah.  Yeah, we haven't been prepared in 10 years for anything.  So you made him cry yesterday?  No.  But he looked on the cusp.  Just don't drag me into that shit anymore.  Not you.  I mean, you know, are you pulling an OB?  Get the fuck out of here.  I was trying to be nice to the guy, and the next thing you know, he's mad at me.  Because I was asking what character he would be in Batman. 
[02:14:30]  Evidently.  And then I guess that I was purposely trying to make him cry.  And then I had one of the guys from David Letterman, one of the writers, called the show,  and he thought that I purposely made that guy call to make him cry.  It was exhausting.  I just want to hang with Ronnie.  Yeah.  I think people realize that.  And I thought Fezzy was feeling left down.  So I was like, I'm going to talk to Fez a little bit.  I think people realize that.  And then I said, you know, Fez, maybe you're having all these troubles because they fired  40% of your staff and don't plan to, you know, rehire so they can just roll that into 
[02:15:00]  executive bonuses.  And then he starts getting all moody on me.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  You know, I was like, well, I just thought, you know, maybe this job would be a little  less stressful if you had a whole.  Ronnie says he likes to just kind of sit back and not be noticed and then fire out his lines.  That's what Fezzy wants.  Yeah.  But don't put the attention on him.  I learned the hard way.  And then I tell Fezzy, Laszlo, I tell Fezzy that I didn't mean it.  I gave him a sincere apology off the air.  And Fezzy's like, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. 
[02:15:30]  And then he goes walk into the bathroom.  The door closes and Ronnie looks at me.  He goes, he don't believe you.  Thanks, Ronnie.  He don't believe you.  Yeah, it's also hard to tell how full of shit Ronnie is, you know?  Well, Ronnie can play the part.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  He knows how to pull those strings.  Oh, yeah.  He's great at that.  As well as other things.  All right.  But back to L.A. Noire.  What are you looking for? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, look at that.  Oh, shit.  He found something on a pad.  He's doing that pencil trick.  Where you scratch it and see what somebody wrote before on the page on top of it.  The oldest problem there is what to do about the old lady.  Thank you.  Yep.  There's a lot of killing off the old lady.  Yeah.  A lot of killing off the old lady.  Is this one case?  Yes, this is one case.  But there's more cases.  Oh, there's a ton of cases.  So after you solve this case, you move on to a tougher case? 
[02:16:30]  And you can bump into a new case as you're being a detective for this case?  Well, there's elements that connect each case.  But each one is self-contained.  And like I said, there are cases that we weren't able to fit into the game because we were running out of discs.  And we thought three discs was sort of a good place for it to be.  But you can get the extra cases if you pre-order it at GameStop.com or you can do it in person. 
[02:17:00]  This guy's full of shit.  Yeah, look at his face.  He's full of shit.  Do you want a truth, doubt, or lie?  I say lie.  You know what you want, Jacob.  You're lying.  Why would I help you if you keep lying to me?  Look, I'm telling you, I don't know.  See, this guy's retarded.  I think he was telling the truth.  I think there was a fucking setup.  That was a setup, man. 
[02:17:30]  For us to think that, but he was just like, he was fucking, he's retarded.  He was looking around, though.  He wasn't making eye contact.  His head was going down.  Because he's retarded.  He's just a guy who's a fucking painter.  Because he's a dummy.  He's a moke.  Do you think because he's a retard?  He's a jamoke, this guy.  A jabroni.  All right.  The bartender there.  A fucker.  And once you say he's lying, can you go back and say, okay, I believe you?  Can you reverse it and go, I believe you now?  You can. 
[02:18:00]  Later on, you can start to get what are those points called?  Intuition points.  Intuition points, where if you fuck somebody up and you accuse them when you shouldn't have,  you can go back.  You get sort of an undo.  Is there a checkpoint?  No, of course.  Stan, how many hours have you played this game?  I don't have to live with that.  He's getting a little teary-eyed.  He's retarded.  He's thinking about that.  He cries at pancakes.  He's getting accused of murdering this chick.  He is.  When did you last see him?  I want to know how long you played this, Stan.  So far. 
[02:18:30]  I mean, it's my full-time job.  I went to see him and talked.  So whatever, 40 times every day of the week.  Wow.  Yeah, and during Crunch, the capture team works weekends as well.  And a lot of times, they don't leave until 10 or 11 o'clock at night.  When are you able to stop playing this shit, Dan?  When is it done enough where you go, I can move on to the next game?  When I tell him.  Exactly.  You know what?  I would fucking go back to that bridge if I was Stan.  I'd never let Laszlo do this to me. 
[02:19:00]  He's like, when I tell him to, you piece of shit.  So he plays that many hours just to find something that will look cool in a promo?  Laszlo.  Well, I mean, you know, with the trailers that we work on, we work on each one of those for weeks.  I think this mental guy would be a good trailer.  You should have added slobber to him.  Where was the slobber camera?  Slobber.  Why did you kill her, Jacob?  Uh-oh.  Things will go better if you come clean about it.  Here we go.  That's a lousy thing to say. 
[02:19:30]  What's the smacking in the hot light?  Gave up on that bike.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we get him into the police station eventually.  You got waterboarding in this game?  No, there's no waterboarding.  Damn it!  And the thing is, is...  I don't believe you, Jacob.  The earlier cases...  You got to do it yourself, so you had someone else do it.  Oh, shit.  Why would you say that to him?  You want to back that up with something, Big Mouth?  Oh, shit!  Yeah, I'll back it up with a punch to the face, motherfucker.  He's got to look at his notes.  Or compelling evidence, Anthony.  Ah, ah.  Marital problems.  The note by the phone suggests you meant her harm.  Oh, shit.  You want the truth? 
[02:20:00]  The truth is, I was sick to death of her.  Yeah.  I was trying to have her committed.  That's right.  That was back in the day where you could just have a bitch committed to me.  How you got fed up with your wife and how you figured killing her.  And you have different partners in each department of the game.  You know my own wife?  It was a loss of the trap and you just couldn't stand it anymore.  Shut your goddamn mouth.  Oh, he's not retarded anymore.  No, no.  He's not retarded anymore, motherfucker. 
[02:20:30]  Remorse, Jacob.  Oh, shit!  It's time to duke it out.  Oh, punch!  Kick his ass, man!  Kick that retard's ass!  Oh, Dan's punching him in the face!  He's just about seen rare.  He does look very sling blade.  Can the fucking cop move?  Yeah.  And the guy will run out the door or something?  And then you've got to start over from the checkpoint.  Damn, he cuffed him and everything.  There you go.  No tasers? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, no.  No, this is 1932.  They just pulled out a snub nose and shot you back then.  Fuck it.  Operator, give me R and I.  And we actually licensed real radio from the period, so I had to listen through.  Oh, my God.  Dude, there was some of it that was so racist you couldn't even put it on.  I was like, I can't put this in the game.  Yeah.  You got an example of that?  Just because...  What's your job?  What do you do?  I'm sorry, Lanzlo.  I just know you work for Rockstar.  What do you do?  I help run the production department. 
[02:21:30]  Yes, ma'am.  So I write scripts.  I direct talent.  I'm a member of a huge team.  And what's development?  Your development.  What do they do?  What does development do?  I don't know.  So who made up L.A. Noire?  Who made up the idea?  So there's a studio in Australia named Team Bondi.  And the guy there, Brendan McNamara, the head of that studio, he wrote the script.  He directed a lot of the actors. 
[02:22:00]  Whoa.  Semen in the anus, vagina, and stomach.  That sounds like a great Friday night.  Yeah.  Ah, we found semen in the anus.  I want to go back to the racist radio, though.  You got an example of it?  That you couldn't...  Um, what's like the Jack Benny show?  Jack Benny was racist on the radio.  Well, Rochester.  Yeah, Rochester.  Okay, Bob!  Yeah, yeah, that was like...  That was that shit.  Yeah, which I...  We did license some Jack Benny for the game, but I chose some bits that weren't so blatantly... 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Just because, you know, Rockstar's always going to get beat up about that kind of stuff.  Um, even though it was, you know, it existed.  But that's your niche, though.  You fucking...  You're a dangerous company.  But, um...  And then there's a show called The Bickersons, which is, uh...  I guess one of the first real sort of couple sitcom kind of vibe.  And you can hear how it inspired other shows.  Really?  But it is about this couple that every show, they wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning to start fighting. 
[02:23:00]  And he's always threatening to punch her in the eye.  And then she brings home a puppy one time, and he's going to take it out and kill it.  I mean, it's quality entertainment.  They wouldn't even have that...  You couldn't even have that conversation in your own home.  No!  Watch Henry re-interview.  So you didn't want to go two races, Lazo, right?  No, I mean, you want to get a vibe for the period, but obviously, you know...  You don't want to go crazy.  Right, you don't want to go crazy.  Hey, Lazo, Jordan on Instant Feedback. 
[02:23:30]  Video games is a brutal business.  There's a set of stories online from an EA wife.  You know what that's about?  I have no complexity.  He says you should be familiar with it.  Yeah, there was, um...  I guess some spouses of people that worked at EA that were complaining about the hours.  Oh, really?  And how they never see their husbands, whatever?  Yeah.  Boyfriends.  The thing about...  Shut up, bitches.  They're earning money.  Motherfucker.  And that guy could have got off at 5.  He stayed and worked till 12 midnight. 
[02:24:00]  So you didn't have to listen to your horse shit.  Everybody was like, hey, you're gonna go home now.  It's just...  Fuck that.  Right.  Our old radio show, we could have went home at 7.  Oh, yeah.  9.30, 10, 11, midnight.  My wife, fuck that shit.  So maybe that's what that's about.  Maybe it's not that brutal.  Sit and drink beer.  Ah, I like the music.  The fucking city looks great, by the way.  Yeah, so I did a lot of research between Rockstar and Team Bondi to, you know, put actual brands  from the period.  We also came up with brands, because sometimes you go...  You know, when Rockstar approaches people and says, can we, you know, please put your 
[02:24:30]  logo in a video game?  They're like, oh, no.  Rockstar.  And of course, this is L.A. with no Mexicans and blacks anywhere near it.  Oh, no.  Except for getting punched, I'm sure.  Back in the good old days.  In fucking the fifth chapter, there's a black guy getting burned with cigarettes.  And there's no way to believe the black guys.  Just lie.  There's no option.  The only option is lie.  Lying.  Push X, liar.  Wait, is there other options?  No.  There's actually a button combo. 
[02:25:00]  We can call him the N-word.  Rope or gun butt.  That's what you get.  That's a joke.  Love seeing the old cars.  Yeah, old cars.  You got the comedy store in this game.  Obviously, it wasn't the comedy store back then.  It was a gangster hangout.  No comedy store.  Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard, all that shit.  You guys house on the corner of fucking Silvestri and La Brea Sunset Boulevard.  Dan knows where to go.  Can you warp there?  Yeah.  Warp there. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, Jesus.  They didn't have warping in the face.  Yeah.  Exactly.  This game sucks.  Secret powers.  That's what you know.  Warping.  He's got secret powers.  Where's the Star Trek ship?  There's the Hollywood sign in the background.  When it used to say Hollywoodland.  Yes.  God, I love those cars.  Those are the cars that would be on HD Theater, man.  Oh, yeah.  God, I would love to have one of those.  Let's go.  Look at them.  Hey, get out of the way, you lousy screw.  Wait, is that a black guy driving in there? 
[02:26:00]  No, no.  Not with a white woman.  Yes, it is.  Give me your car, nigga.  Give me your car, nigga.  And you let that don't kill you and your white ones.  Of course, he stole fucking interracial couple.  Benny and Barney Hill just got their car ripped off.  You should be walking, nigga.  Yeah.  Get out of the car.  And then you circle back and ask him, where did he get this car from? 
[02:26:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, that's funny shit, man.  Oh, man.  And they interrogate the couple, ask the wife, did you do it?  She said, yes.  He goes, you can go, ma'am.  Push X to let the white woman go.  These cars, the handling is a little different.  Well, yeah.  It's because they weigh eight tons.  Yes, exactly.  This fucking, these guys are crooked cops. 
[02:27:00]  Well, I mean, this isn't part of the mission.  You don't have to carjack.  He needed the car.  Right, okay.  This is just for demonstration purposes.  He exercised his...  I mean, you can just punch a pro couple, a poor interracial couple in the 40s and take  their car.  Like they don't have it rough enough.  Yeah, really.  Oh, that's fantastic.  How long are you thinking, too, for this motherfucker to earn money to get that car?  He's walking.  He was one of the Tuskegee Airmen. 
[02:27:30]  Oh.  He gave him a car.  That's before insurance.  The interest rate was probably 25%.  Yeah, so we did, we recorded a bunch of commercials that were, you know, sound like period commercials, which I had to find people, voiceover talent  that, no.  That would do that.  Yeah, they could do that voice.  It could sound like that.  I know, but then everybody would say, look, it's Anthony.  I know, exactly.  No Anthony in this fucking thing?  No, no, they used, like, pros in this one. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, that's right.  He was good in, what you call it, oh, by the way, I played that game.  Red Dead Redemption.  But I will say, I love Red Dead Redemption, but I stopped.  I thought I was finished.  Oh, really?  And it was more.  Yes.  It's a big game, man.  After the guy jumped off the mountain, I said, yes!  Then he had a son.  I'm like, I, uh, mom, I gotta go with that. 
[02:28:30]  He had a son.  This guy has a son.  Listen, uh.  Look at Mel from Mel's Diner.  It's the guy at the malt shop or something.  I mean.  Is he lying?  That's Ernest Borgnon.  He was telling the truth.  Look at his sad puppy face.  Is it true you got Warren Haynes coming in?  Yeah.  Dude, I'm a huge fan.  I've seen him, like, 15 times.  Oh, hang around.  With that said, we do have to take a break.  Yeah.  Uh, Matt Paxton is next.  From Hoarders.  The Matt Paxton!  Oh.  Dude, my chick watches that show, and I come home, and all my shit is in the trash. 
[02:29:00]  And she's like, we have too much shit.  And I'm like, god damn!  Is he anti-Hoarder?  That show will freak you out.  It scares you.  Like, especially if you watch it slightly high.  If you start leaving a few things around the house, you're like, ah.  You don't want to watch Hoarders High, because you will just throw all your shit out.  I don't want to be like those people.  I know.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  So, Laszlo, the new game, the big plug.  L.A. Noire comes out a week from today.  Nice.  And please pre-order it at GameStop.com, or you can go into GameStop and pre-order it, 
[02:29:30]  and you'll get exclusive downloadable content there.  You can also just go on Amazon and pre-order, as well as Walmart.  What's your biggie that's already out right now?  What's the big, the one that's out now, before L.A. Noire's big drop?  What's still circulating?  We did Undead Nightmare, which was the zombie.  The Red Dead Undead Nightmare?  With the zombies.  Yeah.  Listen, we really got a break, because we got Matt Paxton, the guests are starting to back up.  And then Warren Haynes is going to perform for us a couple songs at 9.30.  And Patrice O'Neal's still here. 
[02:30:00]  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  We will continue.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Busy show.  Laszlo in studio.  Patrice in studio.  Got L.A. Noire on the screen.  Than is playing the game for everybody today.  The old pal Than who works at Rockstar now. 
[02:30:30]  He's got a good gig.  Playing the game.  I'm going to hire all the cast-offs of O.P. and Anthony Rundfitt.  I'd hire Danny, except for the second that I hired him, he'd fucking hate me.  Your fucking management sucks.  That's some bullshit.  You don't know what you're doing, Laszlo.  Wow.  We got Matt Paxton outside the studio.  It turns out he's a fan of the show.  He wrote it on his website.  The Secret Lives of Hoarders.  There he is, Matt. 
[02:31:00]  Hoarders.  They're scary people.  Matt, sit over here with the big boys.  I know you.  I've seen this guy.  We know you from the show.  Of course.  I'm a big fan of the show.  My God.  Those hoarders are out of their minds.  What's up, guys?  How are you, Matt?  How are you doing, Matt?  I'm doing well.  Unbelievable.  The Secret Lives of Hoarders.  The show comes out, and now it opens up this whole thing to people.  Hoarding.  Now, I think we all knew there were some crazy cat ladies that would have newspapers stacked 
[02:31:30]  up in their house.  But I don't think it's ever been exposed that there are people that you would consider maybe  even normal that just are out of their minds when it comes to keeping shit at their house.  Judges, lawyers, bankers.  I mean, we go into some fancy, fancy places.  Really?  And you walk in, there's six foot of shit in the corner.  A disaster.  Disaster.  Honestly, those are the worst because they've been living the lie so long.  Oof.  And they've been trying to pass it off.  Yeah.  That it's even worse.  I love when I walk into a house where it's like, oh, it's a crazy lady down the street 
[02:32:00]  because at least I know what I'm walking into.  Yeah.  And that's usually what everybody thinks it's going to be is the crazy cat lady.  Yeah.  We always say they're kind of like the mascot of our disease now.  Yeah.  But it's everybody, man.  I mean, everybody.  You also learn that there's so many people that are hoarded.  I thought it was like kind of a rare thing.  Yeah.  I mean, we were doing it for two years before I even knew what the word was.  Right.  I just thought there were people that were white trash.  Yeah.  It was just called white trash.  Seems to be at least one in every neighborhood in America.  I mean, the number we hear is like 3.5 million. 
[02:32:30]  Wow.  But that's the ones that you see like on hoarders that I cleaned, the level fives.  Yeah.  But the real ones, the bad ones are like, you know, your mom, that's a level one.  You know, that she's got a couple things.  Wait, what's a level five and what's a level one?  Level five is what you see on.  With the cat shit and the carcasses.  Yeah.  You can't go upstairs anymore because you put your bag of shit on the stairs.  That's Finger of God.  I cleaned that one.  Oh, God.  Did you?  Oh, yeah, I did that one.  That was our favorite hoarders, right, Ant?  The one where you couldn't go upstairs because the shit was going all the way up the stairs? 
[02:33:00]  I was sick for two weeks after that.  I literally...  What does it smell like, sir?  That was a new one.  It was more like a citrusy, tangy poo.  It was really...  What was the note?  What was the note in the mouth?  It was the only one that came through the mask.  I mean, I'm wearing a P95 mask and you could still taste shit in your mouth.  And how long, like after you go home, isn't it in your sinuses?  Like you could still smell it?  It's in your hair.  You want to shave your hair.  It gets in you.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, you have to blow your nose for days. 
[02:33:30]  Now, I've seen a few of these episodes where people are just belligerent and they have  to be handled with these kid gloves.  Which we hate.  I think we've all talked about it.  And I think probably anybody you've talked to has said, turn around and tell these people  to just knock it off.  You want to punch them.  You want to do something.  And the challenge of that is that we assume everyone's on the same mental plane that you  and I are on.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  And with these hoarders, they're on a different world.  I mean, literally, their brains, if they scan their brains, it works differently. 
[02:34:00]  And so I see a pile of crap and I see a hundred dead cats.  They see a beautiful vase on the table.  Really?  And so they really, I mean, yelling at them obviously doesn't work.  I mean, it's like having a buddy that's just hammered and you're like, dude, get your life  together.  And you're screaming at them.  I've been saying that to Anthony for fucking years.  At least people come and clean my house, though.  My God.  A hoarder's always something that you have to throw.  Like you said, a beautiful vase.  Are there hoarders that hoard beautiful vases?  Like they just, they have a bunch of nice shit with their hoarders? 
[02:34:30]  Where it's real shit.  Yes.  Season four, you know, season three, we went pretty extreme.  It got really nasty.  Season four, you're going to see a lot of really interesting collections that are very  valuable.  You go over to somebody's house and they got like the precious moment shit all over the  place.  Yeah.  My least favorite thing you see like, you know, statues or a Christmas.  One lady had 40,000 cookie cutters.  They have like, wait, wait, wait.  The Christmas room in their house.  Yeah, but go back to that.  Very valuable.  So what, why is that a problem if their shit is worth a lot of money?  It's not about the money. 
[02:35:00]  It's, it's the fact that they've let their life go.  They've lost friendships.  They've lost families.  They've lost jobs.  That's the problem.  The house is not functional as a house anymore.  I have new shoe boxes everywhere.  And then I have to like, I just gave some away.  I had to find away stuff.  Are you taking a dump on top of those shoes?  Holy shit.  I hope so.  Wait a minute though.  That's what I'm saying.  So, so a whore, cause I'm not familiar, only familiar with, cause I, you know, you watch  it or whatever, but it has to be something else. 
[02:35:30]  It can't just be you collect a bunch of shit.  Exactly.  And that's a great point.  There's a reason they do it.  There's a trigger.  Something bad, something tragic's happened in their life.  Yeah.  And to answer your question, this is how I deal with it.  I walk in there and I'm like, come on lady.  I got to shovel up all this poop.  You know, it's like, this is getting ridiculous.  But I have to remember something really bad happened in her life to make her choose to  do it.  No one wakes up and says, Hey, I'm going to be a whore.  I'm going to kill 200 cats in my house.  You usually see they're surrounded by enabling people too, that, that, that you're even more  angry with.  Yeah.  Like I've seen people where it's like, why doesn't this person take control and, and 
[02:36:00]  try to get this person to stop?  Usually the, the, by calling us, honestly, is the way they've done it.  It's, it's pretty hard.  You know, pulling this off on you.  I mean, a hoarder, a hoarder, man, they are like amazing at denial.  I mean, like the best professional deniers.  And so, I mean, you literally, it takes professionals, both therapists and organizers to come in there  and get through the wall.  You'll see them start crying about, uh, they haven't seen their family in years, their 
[02:36:30]  children don't come over and, and, and they'll say things like my family's the most important  thing in my life.  Yet they won't throw away something from 10 years ago.  That's a piece of crap, uh, because it's important to them, but then their family is the most  important thing, but they're leaving.  Can we acknowledge that I asked him, I asked him something, he said, I go, he goes, but  did, did you take a shit on top of it?  Like, I went, yeah, yeah, I just, I didn't, I didn't realize you had to say it just registered.  Yeah.  Like, that's a hoarder. 
[02:37:00]  There's a hoarder.  So people, now we know what hoarder is.  It's just like, it's a lot of shit that you acquire, but you do other strange things with  it.  Something else has happened.  There's something else going on in your life.  It just ain't collecting shit.  It's not just collecting.  What was the number one hoarder for you?  Since the show started everything.  Um, excuse me, I hate to even bring it up, but Hannah was pretty extreme.  We did the head of the thing.  The chicken lady.  Oh yeah, you did the chicken lady.  Yeah, we did the head of the thing.  Oh God, I couldn't stand her.  She punched in the face.  She was really aggressive.  Well, she was holding chickens.  You started getting nasty with her. 
[02:37:30]  She had 200 chickens in her, oh, I got really, yeah, I will.  I'm different.  I don't hold kick-ups.  I know, yeah.  Because I go right at them, I mean, I treat it this way, I'm gonna, if I'm gonna help  you, I'm gonna treat you like my family, and my family, if we love you, we're gonna make  fun of you, and we're gonna get in your face.  And that's what I do with hoarders.  I've watched the show like it's a sporting event, because sometimes you've gotten on the  people, and I'm like, finally!  I'm like yelling at the TV, going, yes, yell at this idiot!  Because that dumb psychologist ain't gonna do it.  Well, I do it with respect.  Stupid kid gloves.  They have laws and morals they have to stick to. 
[02:38:00]  You're going, well, you don't want them?  Great, fine, then don't.  Right.  And then you walk out of the place, and it's like, good!  I have no problem walking out.  Who contacts you?  Who...  Usually it's family members, it's rarely the actual hoarder.  It's usually the family members.  So, if we're seen on TV, it's safe to assume that they signed the contract to go clean  my house, but, so you've had a lot of reluctant, like, okay...  Sure, yeah, a lot of times, and we'll even turn people down in our private, I mean, I do  this full-time privately as well, so for every one you see on TV, I'm doing 10 more 
[02:38:30]  at home.  Oh, so you're like a life coach?  So people hire your company?  Okay.  Like family members?  I'm like the worst life coach.  I mean, I'm there to push you past this brick wall that you've got.  I'm not going to be the guy that hugs you and gets you, you know, six years away, keeps  you clean.  I'm the one that keeps your kids in the house and keeps you from losing your house from  the bank the next day.  Have you ever had somebody, have you ever had a situation where you go, fuck them,  this episode's canceled, we're not even dealing with this fucking douche?  That's not my, I would love to, but... 
[02:39:00]  It's not his call.  It's not his call.  It's not his call.  Okay, you're not the boss of the show?  No, I mean, sometimes you get in there and you...  He's the cleanup guy.  I'm the trash man.  So the producers have never had somebody that they said, ah, this is, just let him live  in there.  His company's Clutter Cleaner, by the way, we haven't mentioned yet.  Clutter Cleaner on Twitter.  Let him live in turkey shit.  Let's get out of here.  Who cares?  Have you gotten, because I always wonder when they're giving that rah-rah speech, the shrinks  and stuff, to the cleanup crew, now make sure Margaret is allowed to look at everything 
[02:39:30]  before you take it out.  It looks like the crew's standing there and sometimes they put their head down and are  they laughing?  Are they looking like, oh, Christ, it's nut.  You know, we do use the guys from In One In Her Got Junk and they're actually trained fairly  well.  They know what they're doing.  And they've been in more hoarding houses than, other than me, they're the only ones  that know, you know, how to really clean a good house.  They know how it mentally goes.  We set it up, I mean, strategically, there's a way to do this.  So you'll see me pick a room on purpose that's really easy.  And so I get them warmed up and, you know, and then I go, I'll find pictures or, you 
[02:40:00]  know, we'll find, we bring them things that keep them happy and then we just punch  them in the stomach and say, okay, here's your dad's been stuff.  It's time to let's talk about this.  We got to get rid of it.  So do you, once you start cleaning, do you, do you at least go, oh wow, but this might  be valuable or you just shovel?  No, no, we go there then because pictures are very valuable for family, especially if  you've had a deceased family member.  There's always a lot of jewelry.  We find money all the time.  I found it.  You put all that in your back pocket?  If it's clean, you know, we sell it for them and give them the money. 
[02:40:30]  Most of these people are in really bad place.  No, fuck that, man.  I mean, you know, shit, this is under, this hundred dollar bill is under fucking Buffalo  piss.  You, you weren't going to spend it.  Money spends, man.  If there's money, we'll bring it to them.  We found, we found a Michael Jackson thriller, original thriller album.  And it was so far at the bottom of a pile that it was in perfect condition.  Oh, wow.  It was like, it was like, it was so, so compressed.  It was safe flat.  That's my worth now for another few years or whatever.  It was 1200 bucks.  1200 bucks for thriller?  For the original. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  1200 bucks.  That's still a lot of money to me.  Uh, we found $40,000 in U.S. savings bonds and the lady thought they were expired and  we were like, they're matured.  There's an extreme difference.  Wow.  How did they're expired?  And they're $40,000.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, I had a left with them.  Yeah.  I've made, I've made, I've made more than $40,000 off that story than actually taken  the money.  Ah, there you go.  We, we know that these people are down and out.  They're good people somewhere.  My job is to find out that goodness.  So her hoarding though, if she wasn't a hoarder, she would have never waited. 
[02:41:30]  So the fact is that, that actually is, was a bank.  It did mature.  It held her disgusting habit is it was putting it in the bank.  I'll go with you a little bit on that.  There is good in it and everything bad.  You just got to dig deep enough to find that good.  So what was your saddest moment where you almost got, you, it got to you with like,  shit, I feel bad.  Or you feel sympathetic to the level of like you had to maybe almost cried. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it takes a lot to make me cry nowadays.  I mean, I, I found some, I found some, some real sad child pornography, like Polaroids,  like the dude had taken them.  Oh shit.  And I just had a, I had just had a, and you pocketed those.  Yeah, of course I'll take that.  Well, that's, that's more of an angry story.  Like you kitty fucker.  We had to come to us.  You just made it really hot.  I mean, we were, we were still very broke at the time.  I mean, I, I didn't start this job because I thought it'd be really cool.  I was, I was down and out, man.  I, I was the only job cleaning up shit was the only thing I could do. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  You know?  And so I needed the money.  I needed to finish the job.  I needed to pay rent.  You were affording bills.  And the problem was we found these Polaroids of some seriously nasty porn.  And we were like, man, we got to call the cops.  Got to call the cops.  Now you call the cops.  Oh, you have to, man.  That guy's in jail, man.  That guy's in jail, man.  Wait, so he was a hoarder.  I wonder if he keeps his shit in his cell.  Child pornography.  He's probably getting raped.  Motherfucker, throw these blankets away, you dirty bastard.  Explain this to me.  Somebody, a TV guy comes to you and says, can we please go through all your shit? 
[02:43:00]  At what point did he sign off on that?  He had to know.  For hoarders, if I'm there, it's because they're going to lose their children, they're going  to lose their spouse, or they're going to lose their home.  I mean, like tomorrow.  Somewhere in the back of his head, he knew he had some kitty fiddler pictures in that pile.  Under cat piss and cat shit.  Well, that guy was in such denial that he had lied to himself so many times.  He didn't think it was that.  He didn't think it was that big a deal.  Hey, I got it.  Wow.  We got Warren Haynes in the green room, so we don't have a lot of time left with you.  But rats.  Rats.  I was disappointed in the rat episode because it was, me and Ann talked about it. 
[02:43:30]  It was rats from a pet store that the guy was hoarding.  It started with two rats, and then they just kept multiplying.  I wasn't as impressed as like this.  The sheer number of rats was a little amazing.  But have you ever seen like a New York City subway rat?  San Francisco rats are ridiculous.  I'm heard the New York ones are as well.  I mean, they're bigger than cats.  I was excited for that episode, and then when I saw they were pet rats, I was not into that  episode as much.  But my question is, have you gone into houses where you have seen fucking rats?  Yeah.  I mean, it's not the rats. 
[02:44:00]  An empty house with rats is fine.  It's when you see like an eight-foot rat's nest that's just eaten up in the newspaper.  In the middle of it.  In the middle of it, and you're like, holy crap, what's in there?  It's not what you see.  It's what you don't see.  Okay.  And you smell it.  You know the smell of rat urine.  You know there's some big-ass rats in there.  That's scary.  When they have caged animals, and they think they're taking care of them, too, that's  They do believe that they are.  They actually think that they're loving and taking care of these animals.  And meanwhile, like, there's a dead cat.  There's a cat with like holes in it, and just pussy-eyed cat, like you see on the late 
[02:44:30]  night commercials.  And they're like, and when animal control comes, they're crying and saying, why are you doing  this?  They don't understand.  Like, this thing, half of these things are going to have to be put to sleep.  I promise you, with all their heart, they truly believe they're taking care of  That is so sick.  I don't care about their hearts.  It's exhausting.  I swear it's exhausting.  I don't want to have to try to convince them.  I yell at the TV.  I honestly yell like, just burn the place down!  We all are going to laugh.  Our whole crew listens to you guys.  Most of our camera guys are from New York, so we listen to you guys all the time. 
[02:45:00]  And I'm yelling back at you guys.  And y'all are saying stuff on the radio.  I picture hoarders.  I've never seen the show.  I'm sorry.  It's a great show.  It's so much shit.  I watch, I'm watching, uh, porn, porn stars.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm watching black people scream at this guy who only gives them $7 for their fucking  wedding ring.  So it's like, it's just, it's just what you watch, you know.  Uh, but I picture hoarding, people who hoard to be, uh, unattractive. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  The ones we show are, I would say that, they're, they're sad people.  They're damn, I mean, when it really sums it up.  The largest hoard abroad ever.  We've had, we've had a couple.  A few daughters.  I've seen like a few daughters where it's like, aw, that girl would be such an easy lay.  Like, you just gotta take her to a clean room.  You come across any, any meth?  We find drugs and guns.  Dude, what is it about meth people?  They want to hoard, they steal bicycles and take them apart.  If you see no teeth, you know, if you see no teeth, obviously it's weird.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  And we, we do deal with that a lot on the show.  You get there and you're like, you're dealing with the hoarding, but then you're like, man,  what about this, you know, meth problem going on in the back room?  That may have something to do with it.  That drug, that drug turns people into hoarders.  Man, horny as hell, you can't come.  We got, we definitely have Warren Haynes, but.  Let me hear real quick.  On the book.  Yes, yes.  The book is for everybody, not just about hoarders.  It breaks it down to basically if your wife's keeping too much stuff around the house and  you need some hints on how to get rid of the stuff.  Before it starts.  It's called True Stories of Tackling Extreme Clutter, The Secret Lies of Hoarders by Matt Paxton. 
[02:46:30]  You can stick around and listen to Warren Haynes play if you want, and we'll probably  get another plug or two in for the book and the show Hoarders.  Brought you guys some Clutter Pinner t-shirts, too.  Right, because I mean.  Oh, nice.  For your hoarder viewing.  I wanted to ask you another thing, though.  People seem to sometimes get upset when they see 1-800-JUNK.  Like, the second the trucks pull up, you're pretty much telling the people what you have  is junk.  Like, isn't it insulting?  Like, I don't care. 
[02:47:00]  Insult the hell out of them.  At first, people did, and now they know that they're actually going to get some hand care.  I mean, people actually do sort through the stuff.  Because it seems like, oh, they're coming to get my things.  They look at it like it's treasure.  And meanwhile, you're like, yeah, bring the junk trucks up.  What you need to worry about when the two guys in a landscaping trailer show up, and  they're going to throw everything away.  They're not going to look at your stuff.  At least you're going to have positive care, and people are going to look for your things  when we show up.  Yeah.  Okay.  Cool.  Guys, thank you for all you support on the show, man.  Oh, please, man.  We love it.  I love it.  I love the show.  It's great.  June 20th, season four starts, and we did recaps of everyone that would let us come 
[02:47:30]  back into their house.  That's great.  I love seeing where these people end up, because some of them have kind of kept things up.  Some are awesome, and others just fell right back into it.  This is not a before and after show.  It's the reality of what happens in life.  And I hope they're all bad.  We had some good ones.  We actually had some good ones.  I hope they're all bad.  They went right back to collecting cat shit.  Fuck those people.  So sick of the me, me, me's out there.  What a heart.  Done with it.  You're the same way.  Come on.  I know.  Jimmy certainly is. 
[02:48:00]  Like I said, I yell at the TV at these people.  We're gasoline, a little diesel fuel, a match.  Send them to the movies.  Let them come back to a smoldering house.  Matt Paxton, a pleasure.  Oh, absolutely.  Fan of the show, which I think is really cool.  Of our show, and we're a fan of your show, certainly.  And it's Clutter Cleaner on Twitter.  Yep.  Yep.  All right.  We're going to have Warren Haynes play for us next.  We're pretty excited.  Lazl, big fan, right?  Big fan.  Seen him like 15 times.  Wow.  Cool.  That means you're going to have to leave.  And if you want to stick around, Matt, you're more than welcome. 
[02:48:30]  A little bit, yeah.  All right.  Thanks.  This should be called the Blithering Idiot Show on the Boneyard.  Because music guys always salad, they know what they're talking about.  Yeah, that was a little song done in 1975.  It was windy.  You know, but that's because they just look it up. 
[02:49:00]  I don't do that.  I'm lazy.  When I'm on the computer, believe me, I'm not looking up music facts.  Tonight at 10 Eastern, Norton's Obsessed on the Boneyard.

Oh, this is cool.  Very, very busy show today. 
[02:52:30]  Laszlo's in doing the L.A. Noire, which comes out in a week, right?  A week from today.  Oh, yeah.  Looks great, Laszlo.  Another big hit for Rockstar Games, certainly.  Yes.  I guess Matt Paxson from Hoarders had to leave, huh?  I guess he's not that big of a fan of our show.  He was going to do another show.  Oh, he's very busy with this book.  Yeah.  With his book, The Secret Lies of Hoarders by Matt Paxson.  Amazon.com.  Paxson.  Available now.  Right.  This is probably the most sober I've ever been seeing Warren play.  Really?  I have been tripping my face off at some of his shows. 
[02:53:00]  Well, we got Warren Haynes in studio.  I'm a newer fan.  I'm not going to lie to you.  You go way back with Warren?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I don't know how far back you could say, but when you guys did the Phil and  Friends stuff, especially with Joan Osborne, those shows, she tore the roof off.  You guys together.  It was like her voice and your guitar.  Oh.  Yeah, we did PNC Bank.  Oh, that was a great, great show.  You probably did that one, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a fun band.  We had a lot of great shows with that band.  Yeah, they took a really interesting twist on a lot of dead tunes. 
[02:53:30]  Really?  Yeah, it was a Warren twist.  It was nice.  Because Warren's pretty much in the dead, the Allman Brothers, Government Mule, and now  just solo as well?  Yeah, this is actually my first solo record in a long time, so I'm going to be promoting  it for quite a while.  It's called Man in Motion.  I was reading the reviews in the paper today, the four stars in the New York paper, brother.  Wow.  Damn.  Four stars for Warren's new album.  Dude, he is an animal.  You can go to a music festival, and he plays with every band. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  He comes out with every band.  Well, you know, some of these places like Bonnaroo and stuff, you know everybody.  You know, if somebody says, hey, you want to play, what am I going to say?  No, I don't want to play.  That's the fact, though, he's so a matter of fact about it.  It's like bands are asking you to come up and play with them.  He's the go-to guy.  Yeah.  You know, it's a small world, though, more so than people think, I think.  You know, musicians get to know each other, and you do the same kind of circuit, and I'd  rather play than watch. 
[02:54:30]  You know, it's like when you watch sports, it makes you want to play.  Right, right.  And I just saw you at the Beacon Theater.  I go every year for the Allman Brothers.  God damn.  It was a good year.  Great show.  Yeah.  He's part of...  I just needed a history.  I'm sorry.  He's basically the Allman Brothers at this point.  But you was part of the Allman Brothers?  No, no, no, no, no.  I've been there 22 years.  Jesus.  Wow.  Wow.  22 years?  Wow.  No, and I'm only 24.  I wouldn't be surprised.  But yeah, I joined in 1989. 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  The band was broken up from 81 until 89.  Then we did a reunion tour in 89, and we all thought it was just for a year, just to see  what happens.  You know?  Wow, that went good.  Let's do it again.  And it just kept going.  And were you there when what's-his-name left?  Why can't I remember his name?  Dickie Betts?  Dickie Betts.  I saw him play at a bar on Long Island and nearly got my fucking face kicked in.  Well, we might have a Dickie Betts story, too.  What happened?  I walked in, and I was really... 
[02:55:30]  Were you Dickie's wife?  Dude, I've never seen so many Harleys outside.  I saw that story.  A lot of fucking Harleys outside.  And I go in, and I'm standing there, and all of a sudden, a beer bottle smashes on the  back of my elbow.  I turn around.  This huge biker goes, you're standing in my old lady's waist.  You can't see.  I was like, sorry, sir.  You didn't turn around and go, hey, fucko.  You know who I am?  I was like, sorry, sir.  I'll go to the back.  I didn't know you were in the Olin' Brothers for 22 years.  That'd be fun to see Laszlo get beat up like a friggin' Grand Theft Auto character. 
[02:56:00]  Who was the original Olin'?  That wasn't Mike McDonald?  No.  You know nothing about it.  That's Doobie Brothers.  That's the Doobie.  Sorry.  I'm just asking.  I'm trying to learn, motherfucker.  You know a lot about white history.  I'll give you that.  Jesus Christ, I'm trying to learn.  You walked in, you thought it was Meatloaf.  No, I didn't.  That was an asshole.  No, you got Greg Allman.  Dwayne Allman died in a motorcycle accident in the 70s, early 70s.  I know the Allman Brothers.  And then you had Dickie Betts.  Sometimes it gets confusing.  Then you got Trucks.  And that's about where I fade out. 
[02:56:30]  So an Allman Brothers and Rap World, they're Jay-Z or they're little, what are they?  What would the Allman Brothers be in the Rap World?  Oh, my God.  What's the level?  Public enemy?  You have to go with a classic.  Respected?  Sugar Hill gang.  Very respected.  Respected Sugar Hill gang.  Yes or did?  Respected.  I think P.E. is, that's...  Public enemy.  Yes.  Old school, classic.  Okay, fair enough.  But Patrice, you know a little bit about white boy music.  Yes, I do.  You don't know the Allman Brothers?  When I hear, I get introduced weird. 
[02:57:00]  When I first got introduced to a lot of white music was wrestling, when they used to allow  you to have regular songs as your intro music.  So I was like, oh shit, that's nice.  And I got into it a little bit.  But I know if I hear some famous Allman Brothers...  Give him a famous riff, Allman Brothers riff, then he would absolutely know.  Well, let's see, there's...  That's one way out.  Yeah.  Moon Patrol.  Jessica. 
[02:57:30]  That's a...  I heard that one.  Grammy Awards.  He's the ones that...  He's the ones that...  I heard that one.  I just got a pointer.  The one that you go, a black person would and should know this.  Well, yeah, I don't know about should, but...  You would go, okay, I'll put this one.  I think most black people would like the Allman Brothers because the music was born out of  soul music and jazz and blues and...  No, I mean, but a hit, though, so I can go, okay, okay, hold on, okay.  The biggest hit was Ramblin' Man, but there's songs like Whippin' Post, which was a... 
[02:58:00]  Lord, I was born a ramblin' man.  I know that, but I never took the time to go, oh, that's the Allman Brothers.  That's just like...  Well, that's not nice of you.  That's like that song, rock and roll.  You go, I know that.  But you go, I'm not going to go fucking learn that.  You compare the Allman Brothers to the Gally Blue?  No, I fucking did it.  Don't put me in a...  Don't try to be Fox News-y on me.  I'm saying that.  Fox News-y.  Don't try to play me like I'm...  I'm trying to learn right now, and I'm not going to have to go and get up.  I didn't...  Because I thought Allman Brothers was more bluesy or whatever than Ramblin' Man, but I 
[02:58:30]  didn't think that was...  That's like Ramblin' Man.  Ramblin' Man was...  That's the most country that the Allman Brothers ever got, but it was also a big hit.  Yeah.  And you're right.  Most of the stuff is more bluesy.  Mm-hmm.  I'm just trying to learn...  I'm a fan of Blue Sky.  Oh, yeah.  Blue Sky is a beautiful song.  I love Blue Sky.  Yeah.  I love the guitar work on that.  That was a Dickie Betts song.  Why don't we...  Why don't we...  All right. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Dickie Betts song.  Warren Haynes, his new album's called Man in Motion.  He's got his guitar.  Let's get something out of him today.  What do you want to play, Warren?  I think I'll play River's Gonna Rise.  Right on.  Darkness has the phases 
[02:59:30]  We hold the power  We don't need to be rich  We only need to be free  Chains of oppression  Never gonna break  But a day will come  When we hold the key  Time will remind us 
[03:00:00]  That people still have a voice  And we don't want violence  Until there's no other choice  But the river's gonna rise  Watch our struggles in a way  Oh, the sun is gonna shine  Time on a brand new day  Bells will be ringing 
[03:00:30]  Flames reaching to the sky  Higher and higher  Fueled by the winds of chains  Sweet taste of rain  Fresh on the tips of our tongues  And the dust of the past  And the dust of the past  As all that shall remain 
[03:01:00]  Echoes of our voices  Raining all through the town  We drown out the memories  Of the days we were bound  The river's gonna rise  Watch our struggles away  Oh, the sun is gonna shine  Down on a brand new day 
[03:01:30]  I said the sun is gonna shine  Shine down on a brand new day  Damn  Yeah  Oh my God  Warren Haynes  Off his new album  Man in Motion  That's  River's gonna rise 
[03:02:00]  Damn  Everybody's saying  Like how great his voice is  Yeah, yeah  Warren's got the great  The great voice  Sounds amazing  Absolutely  We got Brian from Tennessee  He's been waiting online  For a while  He wants to talk about  The new album  Brian, what's going on?  Hey guys  Hey Warren  Big fan  Congrats on the new album  Thank you  I got a guitar question for you  Uh-huh  Looks like you went with ES  Instead of Les Paul's  On the new album tour  Is that based on the sound  You wanted for the soul stuff  Or is it more an aesthetic  Visual decision  To distance yourself  Between the new stuff 
[03:02:30]  And We Will  It was to get a different sound  For the music  Which I think  That kind of fits  This music  Better than the Les Paul does  Uh  But it looks cool too  But  Yeah  Yeah  Sounds great either way  I was just hoping  The Les Paul's  Weren't shelved forever  No, no  Les Paul's still  My main guitar  But for this record  I went for a cleaner  Sound more reminiscent  Of like  B.B. King  And Freddie King  And a little more  Old school  Yeah 
[03:03:00]  It sounds great  Thanks for  Booking the show  In Knoxville  Oh  I'm looking forward to it  Alright  You guys have a good day  Thank you  How many days a year  Are you guys on the road  Uh  Personally  You know  I don't really  Keep track  I know in 2004  I did 180 shows  Jesus  And that's  That's not counting  Days off  Travel days  Recording  Rehearsal  You know  So you're never home  Not much  Yeah  I remember that  From the last time  You came in 
[03:03:30]  What do you do  When you're not  Playing the guitar  You know  Music takes up  A lot of my time  You know  If I have time off  I'm usually just  Kind of catching up  On personal time  But  You know  It's a good job  When you do something  You love  You guys know  Where I'm coming from  With that  Musicians are weird guys  Because I know  Like my brother  He's constantly  Just noodling around  On the guitar  Right  Like you can't even  Talk to him  When he's just  Sitting around  Because he's just  Trying to figure  Some shit out 
[03:04:00]  Just fucking around  Right  Yeah  Yeah  And that's all  They do  That's annoying  Yeah  It is  It's a lot  We got a lot  Of people checking in  Let's say hi to  Michael in North Carolina  Asheville  Which is Warren's  Hometown right  Asheville  Big fan boy  From Asheville  We love you Warren  Thank you  Down here  Beer City USA  Again for the  Third year straight  Now  Awesome  But I just wanted  To call in  Big fan  Wanted to say hey  Well thank you very much  You don't have a question 
[03:04:30]  About his new album  Anything  No  Yeah cause he thought  You just wanted to say hi  He thought he'd be more  Responsive to  I'm from where you from  Yeah  He's like good  That's why I left  Asshole  Drink your beer  I got the hell out of there  It's not as glamorous  I played my  I played my way out  That pub  Years ago  When you're sitting  In right now  God Michael  Nothing  And he had  That was what he had  That's it 
[03:05:00]  You got something  I'll be in the Christmas  Jam  December  I'll be there too  Alright Michael  Thank you  I used to hang on  Cricket Street  How about you  Yeah  Someone's reminding me  You might know  Midnight  Rider  Midnight Rider  Midnight Rider  I bet you I know  A lot of songs  It's just  You have to go  Oh that's the  Allman Brothers  And then you  Like I didn't know  Give a little taste of that  Let's see  Electric Light Orchestra  Now I know about  Five of their songs  That's Midnight Rider 
[03:05:30]  Yeah  Yeah  That's the  Basis of Midnight Rider  That was a big hit  I'm going to  Allman Brothers  I'm going to do  The Allman Brothers thing  That's definitely a big hit  I'm going to do  Warren thing too  Because that song  You played  Yeah  You liked it?  Yeah  It was saying something  That was good  It was freedom  He said  Freedom is better than money  You didn't hear that?  You caught that?  You kind of said that  I kind of did  You kind of said that 
[03:06:00]  That's right  Freedom is better than money  That's so fucking beautiful  Let's say hi to John in Florida  Warren Haynes in the studio  John  Hey guys  Hey there Patrice  Hello sir  Hey Warren  Have you ever been handed a song  That you turned down  Because you just didn't feel it?  Handed  You mean like  From a stranger?  No  I mean  Maybe from one of your friends  Or something like that  And they wanted you to sing a song  And you said  I just don't feel it  I can't sing it  Yeah  I mean  You gotta  Kind of  Believe what you're singing 
[03:06:30]  You know  A lot of times  Even if a song's really good  It doesn't mean that  I'll be able to feel it  Or do it justice  Yeah  So that  That definitely happens  Yeah he's gone  That was it for him  God  Al  What's going on brother?  Al  Yeah  Ask Warren about  David Allen Coe  Any good stories?  Exactly  Okay  Somebody  Somebody from Asheville  Exactly 
[03:07:00]  Was it a little bit daunting  To play with  With Phil Lesh  Going out and playing  Some of those  Dead tunes  Because that crowd  It's like playing  It's like a bunch of  Comic book nerds  Sort of the dead crowd  It's like being the  The main band at  Comic Con or something  Except they're all on  Shrooms  Yeah  I mean  I thought they  Treated me great  You know  I'm sure there are  Some fans that are  So hardcore  That  Jerry  Yeah  You know  That they don't want  To see anybody else 
[03:07:30]  Playing that music  And that's cool  If that's the way you feel  I think 90% of them  Enjoyed it  Oh definitely  I know I enjoyed it  That was the main thing  That was a nice thing  It was a different twist  On those songs  You know  That's what the guys want  You know  And I've said this  Many times  It started when I joined  The Allman Brothers  Because  Coming into the  Dwayne Allman role  In the Allman Brothers  That's a daunting  Task  If you choose  To look at it that way 
[03:08:00]  But from the beginning  The guys didn't want me  To copy Dwayne Allman  They wanted me  To be myself  And  The same with the dead  When I  Joined the dead  Nobody expects you  To  Play or sing  Like Jerry Garcia  It's like  When you lose  A band member  Especially one  That important  The most you can hope for  Is to kind of  Stumble upon some chemistry  That hopefully rivals  The chemistry that you lost  But you're not gonna  Get that same chemistry  Back ever 
[03:08:30]  It was  To watch the crowd  Because there were songs  The dead stopped playing  A long time ago  And when you guys  Like fired into  St. Stephen  People went bananas  Yeah there were  A bunch of songs  That we  Brought out  That had not been  Played in a long time  And  Some of  Some of  Jerry's songs  And some of  The pig pen songs  That I was singing  That  You know  The band probably  Hadn't done in 30 years  Yeah  It was amazing  Is that  Is that  Happening this summer  Nothing  As of now  Yeah okay  Who's your mentor  Or  Somebody you might have  Had a  Like a 
[03:09:00]  Dude crush  Where you go  Man I love this guy's  Guitar work  And you go  Damn  Well the first  Three guitar heroes  For me were  Eric Clapton  Jimi Hendrix  And Johnny Winter  Jesus  But I'm a huge  B.B. King fan  And I met B.B. a long time ago  And we've hung out before  This is his guitar right  Or this is the kind he plays  Yeah the kind he plays  Okay  But I finally got to play with him  Last year for the first time  And that was just like  A huge thing for me  Now would you be like 
[03:09:30]  Intimidated  Or are you like  It's excited  Because it's excitement  Or is it like  I don't want to F up  Or you just  You've been doing it so long  You know you're not going to mess up  But you just go  Well  Do you relish it  Do you enjoy it  Absolutely  Something like that  Absolutely  Relish it and enjoy it  And there's some intimidation there  You know when you're meeting  One of your heroes  There's definitely some intimidation  But  Usually  Especially with somebody like him  He's so gracious  That he just makes everybody  Feel comfortable  It seems like music people  That could be horse shit  But probably in the pop world 
[03:10:00]  It's different  But it seems like  In the artist world  It's a lot more  Ingratiating  And a lot more  Love between  People who  You know  It's more respect and love  Like comedians  We you know  We hate each other  We play it off  But we don't support each other  And  But it seems like  Guitarists and everybody  They just  It's more  It's love  It's not as much  Competition  Until  It gets to be  Pop fame  Type of thing  But just  Just loving it  Seems like  People who love it  Love each other 
[03:10:30]  You know  I think real musicians  Gravitate toward each other  If you hear somebody  That you think  Can really play  Or really sing  Then  There's  There's some sort of  Appeal there  You think  Well I'd like to  To play with this person  Because it's  There's an improvisational  Language thing  That happens  You seem too nice  To ask this question  I'm gonna ask you  Okay  Who's a hack  Because look  I had a  You know again  White World  I looked on a  Drummer's list  And this dude  From Rush 
[03:11:00]  The drummer from Rush  Neil Perk  Is number one  On everybody's list  In White World  So I'm talking to my buddy  Who knows guitar  Knows drums a little bit  I go  How the fuck  Can you go  And this guy's one  On everybody's list  So I'm saying like  He thought  Bonham  But Bonham was five  No higher than five  On everybody's list  So okay good  But he's like  Neil Perk's  So like who  Gets the accolades 
[03:11:30]  Like say just  I'm just don't  Like say  On a lot of lists  It's like  Jimi Hendrix is the guy  So who's a guy  That's on a lot of lists  That you might go  You don't have to answer  But you might go  I think somebody else  Should answer that  Right  That's what I'm saying  That's why I figured  It's too  Too fraternity  Like where it's like  You know  Who's the guy  Because you hear Clapton  Oh yeah  You hear  What's the other guy  Steve  Ray Vaughn  Of guitar  You know  Let me ask this  You do have a name  In your head though  Right 
[03:12:00]  I probably have a bunch  Of names  I'd also like to keep working  Yeah I know  No that's what I'm saying  I knew  It's a good question  It seems like  You know  But I was just curious  To know if somebody  Actually goes  Jimi Hendrix  Listen  We're getting basic questions  Government  Government Mule  When are they coming back  When are you guys  Coming back  We're actually going to do  Mountain Jam  Which is this festival  That I co-promote  In upstate New York  Which is the beginning of June  My new band  The Warren Haynes Band 
[03:12:30]  Is going to play Friday night  And Government Mule  Is going to play Saturday night  And that's the only time  This year  That that's going to happen  Right  Government Mule  Is taking a well deserved break  We've been on the road  Since 1994  Jesus  And so we've been talking  About taking a break  For several years  So we finally decided  To do it  Which gave me the opportunity  To put out this solo record  So I'm going to be promoting it  Most of the year  And then  When that runs its course  Government Mule  Is going to start working  On new material  And you know  Excited about it  How do you pay your bills? 
[03:13:00]  He's never home  Who gets your mail  What about your wife?  How long have you been married?  I've been married  14 years coming up  And my wife does  She's a trooper  Does she hit the road  With you a little bit?  She comes a few places  If it's somewhere  She wants to come  Right  And not the shitholes?  No  But you don't play  As many shitholes anymore  But she chooses  Places she would like to come  She picks it  Which is great  That's what I would do  If I were her to  Right  Can we get another song out of you?  Sure  Okay  What's it going to be? 
[03:13:30]  It's up to you  Whatever you want to play  Alright  Last time you were here  You played Soul Shine  Which was amazing  Yeah so I didn't want to do that again  And you played  Old Friend  Which was amazing  It turned me on to a new song there  My friend  I remember that  Yeah  It was really good  Alright let's see  Whatever you want to do  I shall look  I want to go for a long walk 
[03:14:00]  I might need some company  Someone I can relate to  Someone other than me  So I'm tired of these conversations  I keep on having my hand 
[03:14:30]  But it's a long way on  What you made your bed  I'm sick of my shadow  When I shed my skin  I'm sick of my shadow  Worship on me  Worship on me  I'm sick of myself  And everything I do  Sick of my shadow 
[03:15:00]  Since I'm lost to you  Oh yes I've got some problems  But tell me what else is new  I spend too much time in this black and white world 
[03:15:30]  I'm trying to paint it blue  But we can't all be like you dear  With your million dollar smile  Some of us don't bounce back  We stay in town for a while  I'm sick of my shadow 
[03:16:00]  When I shed my skin  Sick of my shadow  Worship on me  Sick of myself  And everything I do  Sick of my shadow  Since I've lost you  Just let me realize I'm hot tonight 
[03:16:30]  Hey Jesus  I swear I'll walk away  Lose this chip on my shoulder  Keeping my demons at bay  I'm sick of my shadow  When I shed my skin  Sick of my shadow  Worship on me 
[03:17:00]  Sick of myself  And everything I do  Sick of my shadow  Sick of my shadow  Since I've lost you  Damn  That's off the new album man  That's unbelievable  Sick of my shadow of course  Off Man in Motion 
[03:17:30]  Warren Haynes' new CD  Is that how it ends on the album?  No  On the CD?  No  On the CD  The guitar and the saxophone  Trade off  And get bigger and bigger  And bigger and crazy  And it  Kind of fades out  One of the pandemonium  And I never could figure out  How to end it  When I'm playing it by myself  I was at mid-head bob  You do just get mesmerized 
[03:18:00]  You know  And then it stops  What the hell just happened?  Yeah it's like somebody  Yanked the cord out of it  Yeah  Hey Warren  I got a question for you  Not to call out Anthony  But he's not a big fan of the blues  Uh huh  What is it about the blues  That you like?  Uh  It makes you feel better  You know  I mean  People say  Oh blues is depressing  No blues is  What  Takes you out of your depression  You know  I mean  It's uh  It's feel good  I'm not even making an excuse 
[03:18:30]  I didn't know you didn't like blues  No I don't  But I'm not making  And I'm not covering anything up  That to me is great  Because the singing's great  It's like  It's got a great melody  Can you be honest?  No he's been honest  Because he's a white guy playing  Just saying  I'm like  Because it's usually old black guys  No  I should explain  He doesn't like real old school blues  I think he likes blues influences  As music progresses  Exactly  But like he  He never got into Muddy Waters  Or any of those guys  I just don't like  Like when every song ends 
[03:19:00]  Like  Bouncing to the ship  Yeah  That's the one he just played  Yeah  It's like a lot different  What if he said  I used to be an air conditioning repairman  Yeah see that  I used to have a long mullet  Would you relate to him then?  No that to me gets monotonous  But that I like  But that's not all of the fucking shit though  It's got the verse  The chorus  I know  It's nice  It's fucking melodic  And sounded great  Could you just say you're racist  Why are we doing this? 
[03:19:30]  I don't have to say that anymore  It's like the sky's blue  Yeah but  Right  You enjoy it  So thank you  And then hopefully  This will open you up  To go  Wait a minute  There's some songs  That sound like  The songs  You know  Warren did  He likes songs  You like Led Zeppelin  He likes songs  That are influenced by the blues  But he doesn't like  The real old school  Down and dirty blues  Cause why?  I eat Jif peanut butter  But I'm sure it tastes better  Than that George Washington  Carver crap  I like after it's been  Whitified  I don't think it's 
[03:20:00]  I don't think it's  You don't like that  Nigga peanut butter  No  I like Jif  I don't think it's as simple as that  So you don't keep  You what?  I don't think it's  A black thing  As far as the blues go  I really don't  I really don't  No it's not  Because I don't like  A lot of white artists  That play that  That type of blues  Like who?  Oh Eric Clapton?  You know what?  I like Eric Clapton's hits  But sometimes it can get  Monotonous to me  Fair enough  I don't know  There's 
[03:20:30]  You know like that  Old school black peanut butter  George Washington and Carver peanut butter  You know how awful  George Washington and Carver's  Peanut butter must have been  He just ground up peanuts  It's like  Peanuts and oil  It's the same recipe now  No good white man preservatives  In there  It's the same thing  You get a whole foods  What are you talking about?  Yeah but see  You just brought up  High fructose white man syrup  You brought up a good point though  Without muddy waters  There would be no Led Zeppelin  Without George Washington and Carver  There would be no Jif  Exactly  So he  He throws away 
[03:21:00]  Without the cotton gin  He tells  Big Mama Thornton  Go die  Fat niggle  And I'm gonna enjoy Elvis  It's very simple  It's a very simple equation  It's very simple  I'm not a complicated man  Warren who's your old school blues guy  You mentioned B.B. King  Who goes pretty far back  I'm a big fan  I mean you know  B.B. King  Freddie King  Albert King  Muddy Waters  Howlin' Wolf  Elmore James  Sunhouse  I love Elmore  Did you like Gary Moore?  Speaking of a white blues guy  He was a great guitar player 
[03:21:30]  We lost him recently  I never met him  But he was a great guitar player  Still Got the Blues  Was a pretty damn good album  Yeah  Gary was quite a great player  Someone that  I'm surprised we never met  Because you know  Yeah no kidding  Most people in that world  I've crossed paths with  At some point  You know  Yeah  But I love the old stuff  But you know  When I was a kid  I didn't get Muddy  And Wolf  And Robert Johnson  And stuff like that  It took me a while  But then at some point  If you listen to it much  If you listen to it enough 
[03:22:00]  It starts penetrating  Are you a lot of guys  In the business  Favorite guy?  Like are you a  Guitar player's guitar player?  Yeah  How do I answer that?  Yeah  Warren is lost  I mean I don't  You know  I know you're not being  I want you to answer that  I mean please  In the way that  You know  I've gotten a lot of accolades  As a guitar player  More so than as a  Mainstream pop star  Right but that's what I'm saying  So you are  The people who know guitar  And the people who play 
[03:22:30]  Oh fuck yeah  You're in there  You are in the mix  Thankfully  I'll answer  He's lost man  Fair enough  Okay  Everybody wants to work with Warren  He's been  You've done work with  Dave Matthews too right?
