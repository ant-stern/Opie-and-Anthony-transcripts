<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about holiday displays at the Seattle airport, sparking a debate about the "war on Christmas" and the inclusion of other religious symbols like menorahs and Kwanzaa representations.  The hosts and callers debated the appropriateness and humor of various holiday symbols, demonstrating varying levels of knowledge about Kwanzaa.  The conversation veered into a discussion of Santa Claus, focusing on online images portraying him as a pedophile and a teacher fired for telling children he doesn't exist.

A significant portion of the show was hijacked by a chaotic interaction with strippers outside the studio who had clogged the bathroom toilet and engaged in loud, vulgar conversation filled with cursing and accusations of drug use. This resulted in a heated exchange between one of the hosts and the strippers, followed by an apology from the hosts.  The hosts then transitioned into promoting the annual eggnog drinking contest, recounting past outrageous events like the infamous clam chowder contest.  Upcoming guests were mentioned: Bill Burr, Joe Rogan, and a promised call from Bob Saget.

The show featured a call from Pat, a regular caller, announcing his "love" for a woman, Tanya, met through PalTalk, the show's online community.  The hosts and callers reacted with disbelief and mockery, focusing on Pat's dilapidated trailer home near an airport runway and his delivery of perfume bottles as a romantic gesture. Tanya joined the call and clarified their relationship was platonic, despite Pat's strong feelings.  The hosts and callers continued to tease Pat, speculating about the relationship's future. This segment also included further promotion of the eggnog drinking contest, highlighting contestants, including Sergeant Magoo, known for his eccentric behavior.  The contest itself began with Flea being the first to be eliminated.

The eggnog drinking contest continued, with Joe Rogan present in the studio audience. Contestants consumed double shots of eggnog every minute; vomiting resulted in disqualification.  The event descended into chaos with multiple contestants vomiting, including vivid descriptions of vomiting sounds and visuals, even vomiting out of noses. Sergeant Magoo famously vomited into a pitcher, mixed it with Fruit Loops, and ate the mixture, causing a chain reaction of vomiting, including an intern who was subsequently offered a permanent position. Pat Fuminaki won by setting a new record of 72 double shots, culminating in him vomiting into the mouth of the new intern, Pat Duffy, fulfilling a pre-contest agreement.

The final segment involved a call from Bret Michaels. He gave a play-by-play commentary of a figure-skating performance he'd filmed, which included midgets, a gold lame costume, and dice.  This segment maintained the irreverent and chaotic tone established by the eggnog contest.  The show concluded with the hosts humorously announcing their retirement, claiming the eggnog incident was untoppable in radio history.  The event, involving at least 30 people in a crowded studio, was extensively documented and anticipated to go viral.

[00:15:30]  happy holidays  kwanzaa symbol which he just took my thunder was a black man in a ski mask  stealing a hanukkah sign from a jewish person  it is not  inappropriate bell is going to get all worn out today  yes we know christmas is a national holiday not just a religious holiday we know that  yeah by the way they do it uh in uh they make they pc up the little drummer boy song too  because a lot of versions is baby jesus but another version is little baby 
[00:16:00]  really yeah like they don't want anybody i don't know why that would be offensive to somebody  baby jesus  oh i'm looking at some myrrh  you wow  it's a red brown uh resinous material the dried sap of the tree  comifora myrrh  what is little jesus to do with that  native to somalia and the eastern parts of ethiopia  the sap of a number of other comifora and balsamodendron species are known as myrrh 
[00:16:30]  i got myrrh one time  oh wait here  did you  yes i opened up a package it was gavin mcleod  myrrh is  is a constituent of perfumes and incense  was highly prized in ancient times  myrrh  i'm giving myrrh  myrrh  myrrh  mary  i'm giving you myrrh  lul  lul  here's some merlu  with some merlo

[00:17:30]  unclipped  a constituent of perfumes and incense  oh is that with a constituent  constituent of perfumes and incense was highly prized in ancient times it was often worth more than its weight in gold  oh so the gold was like third on the list  yeah i guess  what about frankincense  what is that  some type of incense  a scented candle shaped like john kerry  let's say hi to matt in boston matt what's up 
[00:18:00]  no i'm like dude um i think that the ramadan thing is just like kwanzaa except it's like a wooden like menorah and they light like green red and black candles  it's still queer and pointless though  is there some type of like almost menorah thing to it  they said it's like wood  ah  so they said when  people are having christmas and getting gifts they carve a thing on a wood  all right  when other people are having fun  yeah right  they're carving wood  can we get one lousy

[00:19:30]  a cookie  and the kids are conveniently awake  waiting for santa to hopefully arrive  to catch a glimpse  yeah and the parents are the ones that are saying don't stay up you go to bed you're not supposed to see him  oh he oh they see santa  don't see him don't talk to him  they see santa to the point where they don't want to talk about what they saw  so they make believe they didn't see anything  it's a website  that had  nothing but pictures of children  yeah  petrified 
[00:20:00]  being with santa  like from going back from  like the 50s  it's on a website  yeah it was on fark  a few days ago  i guess if you go to a fark  and then the archives  on fark.com  oh  you'll be able to see it  and it's just kids  on santa's lap  and santa coming up to him  and the kids just like  all these faces of them just crying  santa is a horrifying thing to children  i was never a big santa fan  when i was a little baby  i had pictures of me just  screaming hysterical

[00:55:00]  it is  the  annual  the third annual  I believe  third annual  eggnog drinking contest  this is how we welcome  in the Christmas season  every single year  how else are you  supposed to welcome  in the Christmas  time of year  than a nice  eggnog drinking contest  all of our pals  show up every year  some of the same faces  some new ones  some new competitors  and bottom line is 
[00:55:30]  how much eggnog  can you drink  before it all comes  rumbling back  with that wonderful  sound like an  Evinrude engine  being tested  in a 55 gallon  drum  love it  and the contest  is very  very  very simple  for you at home  these guys will  drink a double  shot of eggnog  every single  minute  until we got 
[00:56:00]  one standing  you puke  you're out  you puke  you're out  the current  record holder  is Pat from  Munaki  he set the record  last year  even though he  lost the competition  set the record  lost the competition  interesting finish  we had  last year  well because you  got a whole minute  to drink your  double shot of  eggnog  so there's a little  strategy involved  so what happened  was  yeah  Pat drank his  72nd double shot  of eggnog  and puked  and Badlands 
[00:56:30]  Booker  he still had  time to get  a 72nd shot  down  and he did  he didn't have  to  oh that's right  at that point  he didn't have  to  you're right  first one  to woof  that's it  absolutely  yeah okay  you're right  and then he  puked after  Pat from Munaki  right after  like they were  both holding  it in  and they were  trying their  best not to  puke  Pat was the  first  yeah you're  right  Pat was the  first to  do the  72nd double  shot of  eggnog  puked right  after that  but Badlands  Booker had  time left in  his minute  and he didn't  have to drink  it at that  point and then  he proceeded 
[00:57:00]  to puke right  after Pat  it was an  amazing finish  let's just put  it down  photo finish  amazing  we wind up  meeting a lot  of people that  stay kind of  friends at the  show too  yeah  it's like this  is what we say  around the  Opie and Anthony  show there are  no strangers  in the eggnog  contest only friends  we haven't met  yet  remember we said  that not at  all  what's his name  here who's  gonna like do  a little puke  and then eat  some Froot Loops  for us  oh Sarge  Sarge  Sergeant Magoo 
[00:57:30]  Sergeant Magoo  yeah well on  the Palto  camera the other  day we watched  him eat  butter sticks  and cream  and milk  and ketchup  and then  woof it all  into a Tupperware  bowl  he then poured  in Froot Loops  into what he  had vomited  and ate it  it was so  awful to watch  even on  Palto  I couldn't  imagine watching  that live  but he said  he's gonna  do it  I don't know  if I want 
[00:58:00]  to watch  that  by the way  this isn't  the greatest  puking show  that we  do  what  nothing will  ever beat  the puking  that happened  in Boston  back in the  day  at WBCN  the clam  chowder  that was  a goodie  that was  a great  contest  same  concept  you eat  as much  clam chowder  as possible  and if you  puke you out  you're out  if you won 
[00:58:30]  you were going  to the Super  Bowl I guess  yeah and then  we got a winner  and then we  so happened to  have another  pair of  Super Bowl  tickets  so we got  four or five  guys that were  out of the  competition  to try again  and basically  what they had  to do  man I hope  you're not  eating breakfast  they had to  take a  a spoon  a nice  heaping  spoonful  a tablespoon  full  of the  puke  that was  in the  barrel  that's right  everyone was  using the  same barrel 
[00:59:00]  and the  contest  was simple  all they  had to do  was hold  down the  tablespoon  of puke  for one  minute I  think  I think  it was just  a minute  and they're  going to the  Super Bowl  as well  there were  guys gagging  before they  even brought  the spoon  up to their  mouth  they took  a spoon  remember  there were  a couple  of guys  that took  a spoonful  looked at  it and  just started  going  oh it was  just amazing  and contestant  after contestant 
[00:59:30]  could not  keep this  lousy  tablespoon  of puke  down  so they  continued  puking  some more  and then the  contestants  that were  waiting to  try to win  the tickets  for the  Super Bowl  they started  puking  even though  they weren't  even doing  it yet  just watching  it just  became a  complete  and utter  mess  that day  of Boston  it was  amazing  it was  truly  amazing  so we'll  see what  happens today  with the  eggnog  drinking  contest  we're going  to start  right around  7 o'clock

That's a lot of eggnog. 
[01:05:00]  Real simple contest.  I think we've got about, I don't know, we've got 16 people that want in on the contest.  How many do we want to take?  Like 10 or so?  Yeah, I'm thinking 10.  That's why there is a lot of tarp down.  Wow.  Are you afraid these guys are going to explode?  Well, there was a whole discussion about, you know, if the rug gets ruined, it's going to cost $8,000.  And we don't want to pay the cleaning crew too much money, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  So we've got tarps just taped all over the place.  Usually the puke, you know, ends up in the buckets. 
[01:05:30]  In the bucket.  Guys are pretty good with that.  We've never had a projectile vomit away from the bucket.  And it's a very easy contest.  One double shot of eggnog every single minute until you puke.  Last man standing wins the title.  Happy holidays.  By the way, last year's winner not in the contest this year.  He has retired.  Oh, we thought maybe there'd be a surprise.  He would come in and bum out Pat from Munaki, who lost to him such a close finish last year. 
[01:06:00]  But he's not going to be here.  Badlands booker.  No.  Pat from Munaki won the first annual.  He lost last year, but came in second, but set the record.  So he's just a monster in the eggnog drinking contest.  Opie, if you remember last year, Badlands and Pat, neck and neck the entire way.  And blowing away the competition.  Like they were the only two that were really contestants, competitors at this point.  Everybody else rookies.  Just puking out. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, we knocked out a lot of guys really early and it came down to these two guys.  So Pat absolutely has to be the favorite now.  Pat, you got hair coming in.  Yeah, what's going on?  Let my hair grow a little bit.  Is that your national hair color?  Are you a blonde?  Yeah, a gray.  I'm an alien.  A gray.  Who knew that he was a blonde?  Ew, you are?  Yeah, dirty blonde.  Am I cold?  Nah.  What happened?  Are you sickly?  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  A couple of p-cells.  I wonder who told him to grow the hair back.  What girlfriend might have told him?  No girlfriend.  Oh, was that it?  No.  What?  Did a girl tell you to grow your hair back in?  No.  I like running my fingers through a man's hair.  You're so soft.  No, that's not a direct quote.  Oh, no.  Do you have a girlfriend now?  No.  What was the big news?  You had big news for us today.  I was going to do it just before my first shot, but I'm in love. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  Ew.  Pat.  We've known you for many years now.  Yes.  And, well, at least a couple.  Seems like many.  Feels like many.  Yeah, it certainly does.  When those jokes start.  But we've never known you to be in love.  I've never known me to be in love.  Now, do you have reciprocation in this love? 
[01:08:00]  Well, I've said I love you to this person.  And this person said, I love you back, but not with the same intonation as I say.  Like, I love you.  Oh, no.  You poured your heart out, and she went, love you, too.  Yeah.  With the YA.  How long have you guys been dating?  We haven't been dating.  We've been spending, I call it spending time together.  How much does it cost in you?  About, hey, no.  Oh.  About two weeks, two, three weeks. 
[01:08:30]  Two weeks.  Wow, you said I love you after two weeks, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, you got it bad.  That's healthy, though.  That's not obsessive.  You got it bad.  You got it bad.  How long?  I've been infatuated before, but I've never been in love.  Now, wait a minute.  I've got to ask you this.  You've been together two weeks?  Uh, yes.  Two weeks.  So you didn't say I love you day one.  So how long into it?  And you didn't say, what, today?  So it had to be, what, a week?  I'd say a good week and a half, two weeks. 
[01:09:00]  But it's been two weeks.  Are you just older?  Well, when you know it, I got shot in the heart.  Could have been a palpitation.  I'm not sure.  So you, um, you, you said, what were the circumstances?  I got to know the place, the setting.  Were you dropping her off and you said it?  And then she just yelled back over the shoulder, me too.  And she was going to the house.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  No, they, so.  Uh, no, just, it's a slow over, well, slow over two weeks.  Yeah, over two weeks.  Just.  A whirlwind romance. 
[01:09:30]  That's how sweet this person is.  Yeah.  And wonderful they are.  I just said, there you go.  That's it.  But, but where were you?  Where was I?  In the van.  Oh, she was driving around with me making deliveries.  Driving around making deliveries.  So you just, you felt it so much inside of you that you just, what, turned, were you  stopped at a light?  Uh, no, actually I was at a delivery and she was throwing, throwing boxes at me.  She was throwing boxes at you.  It was after I said, I love you, she's throwing boxes at me.  Helping you out.  Can you pick a more romantic situation to say I love you? 
[01:10:00]  You know, that's when it struck.  Then her helping you, could you help me put this couch in my van?  And we had, what were you, what were you delivering?  What were you delivering at the time?  Uh, boxes of, uh, of, uh, bottles of, uh, perfume.  They're not, they're empty bottles.  They deliver for a glass man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  So you're delivering and then it just, why that moment?  You were looking at her?  Well, other, well, I delivered to this place and the elevator guy's talking to her. 
[01:10:30]  The guy's, I've delivered there for five years and he's never talked to me.  Oh, son of a bitch.  He's trying to C block you.  The elevator, freight elevator guy.  Screw him.  I hope he falls down that elevator shaft.  Or tries to stop it with his arm and it closes anyway and rips his arm over the shoulder.  Yeah.  Then we'll see him flirt.  Would you join the army?  Or the arm lift?  Oh.  I'm working that one out.  Oh, we're going.  That was classic.  Because it was a patch from Monocleon, but yet you really secretly hoped it had something.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  Sorry, you're delivering boxes and you say I love, you just blurted it out.  How did you...  Well, it was when we just got there and we had our song playing.  Oh, what's your song?  You already have a song after two weeks?  Yes.  All Right Now by Free.  It's like, because it's All Right Now.  All Right Now by Free.  Now I listen to the words in songs.  We're listening to How Sweet It Is to Be In Love by You.  How sweet it is to be in love. 
[01:11:30]  Are you?  Oh, no.  Yeah, it's really disgusting.  So what else did you do in 1977?  Yeah, I know.  It's not a new song, Pat.  Yeah.  Did you get some Afternoon Delight?  I said I love you.  We're listening to Strange Fruit.  I just whispered it to her.  Well, it's not Tainted Love.  So you chose that point to...  Oh, yeah.  You looked over...  It wasn't really big.  It was just like a...  I felt it and then I said it. 
[01:12:00]  Was it a production?  Was it kind of like...  Did you touch her?  Did you say, I got to tell you something?  I put my hand on her shoulder.  Uh-huh.  And then when she said, back off...  I almost said a dirty word.  I forgot where I was.  And I said, I love you.  And my head was sort of to the side.  So you tilted your head, you touched her shoulder and said, I love you.  And then what did she say?  She said, I love you.  Oh.  Kind of like... 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Hi, Grandma.  Yeah, kind of like...  I love you.  Like if a kid walks up and goes, I love you.  You go, I love you.  She might as well have said, I'm just being polite.  Oh.  Are you guys, you know...  Oh, no.  Doing the nasty?  No, no, no, no.  Do you see each other every day?  We both have to get our things together.  I have to...  I'm losing weight.  I'm almost under 300 pounds.  I've smelt under 300 pounds.  Wow.  Good.  Today will help.  Yeah.  How much did you weigh when we met you? 
[01:13:00]  I was...  301.  Pushing 350.  350?  All right.  So you lost almost 50 pounds.  Not bad.  Yeah.  But when do you think you're going to have sex with this fine young filly?  I'm not even worried about that.  I'm not...  Taking your time, right?  It takes its time.  I'm trying to get my...  I've been trying to get my stuff together for many years, and I think it's going to go  real quick.  Here's a reason now.  Yeah, I haven't been able to listen to that.  You have a reason.  Yes.  To get out of bed.  It's radical up till now.  Now it's...  To get out of bed. 
[01:13:30]  That's what I want.  To hop in the shower, to get out there and grab life by the earth and have a good time  now with somebody.  I woke up...  She made me wake up in a trailer one day and say,  This place stinks.  I've got to get out of here.  Yeah.  For the people that don't know, Pat has an awful trailer that lives in...  He lives in a trailer that is literally at the end of the runway...  Litter.  ...at Teterboro.  Litter.  At the end of the runway at Teterboro. 
[01:14:00]  Where's my model at?  And there's holes in it, and you can see the ground when you're in the bathroom and all  this stuff.  The water heater rotted out the floor, and it fell right through the bottom of the trailer.  But now you're aware that your living environment stinks.  It's like I've woken up.  Yeah.  You've had an awakening.  Hey, very cool, man.  But now, do you see each other every day?  Pretty much, yes.  Do you talk to each other on the phone every day?  Yes.  And is it a friend conversation, or is it...  You know, you can tell when it's two people in love having a conversation. 
[01:14:30]  Because do you pull the, you hang up first?  No, you hang up.  Okay, we'll both hang up on three.  One, two, three.  Yeah.  You didn't hang up.  Yeah.  Or is it more like you're talking, and she's like, look, I'll hang up first.  Click.  Click.  Just click.  As Pat's still talking.  She's winning the who'll hang up first game.  Undefeated.  78 to zero.  I'll say, though, I had a friend, a girl I'm dating, I was friends with for years first. 
[01:15:00]  And I liked her, and she didn't like me.  And we just stayed friends.  I mean, it was really weird.  So it's possible, but you've got to be patient.  Three years.  Yeah.  I might be feeling things ahead of time.  Oh, boy.  We're just waiting.  Let me tell you how this can go.  This girl can fall head over heels in love with Pat, which I hope the best for Pat.  You're starting from the rare possibility starts.  Why don't you just say, Anthony, like, look, we have to say this because statistically it's a possibility. 
[01:15:30]  Right.  It's a slim possibility.  Exactly.  I didn't buy a ticket.  And everything can work out fine and dandy.  And that would be the best thing for you.  Yeah.  Or if this girl breaks up with him, not even breaks up because I don't really see this cohesive relationship yet.  Yeah.  How are you going to do it?  There will be Pat in his trailer.  Are you going to blow your brains out?  Are you going to slit your wrists?  What are you going to do?  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Because this will end in a suicide if she blows you off.  How will you kill yourself when she does leave you?  Wow.  Well, I do drive for a living.  Oh, he's going to take out an innocent victim with him.  No.  Bridge abutment.  Yeah.  Something like that.  The corner where the bridge.  Like where there's a fork in the road and there's a big concrete barrier.  Yeah, yeah.  See, he's already thinking about it.  Something like that.  And just cut yourself in two.  You've already thought about it.  Just do us a favor and have some kind of spectacular Opie and Anthony death for us, all right?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Make sure I'm wearing an O&A shirt.  Lots of signage on the vehicle.  A lot of signage on the vehicle.  He's going to say, O&A party ride.  Hey, let's go to Frank in Jersey.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Jesus Christ, Pat.  You're supposed to be the one vomiting.  Hold on, man.  Let Pat put his headphones on.  Go ahead and say it again.  Gee, Pat's supposed to be the one vomiting.  Not getting the rest of the audience to vomit.  That's my secret weapon.  Let Pat have some love.  All right.  I need some love.  I feel you're not going to win the contest this year. 
[01:17:00]  You're too much in love.  He's distracted.  I'm not talking about this.  This is a distraction.  You don't have your eye on the prize?  No.  You certainly don't.  I got a cold.  He's got a cold, and he's just thinking about love.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Is it all consuming?  Are you just, do you only think about horror?  I'm driving, and red light, green light, who cares?  I'm sure it was green a minute ago.  Oh, he's so in love.  Oh, Pat.  And you've never been in love.  We watched movies together.  We watched Legends of the Fall, and we were crying. 
[01:17:30]  I pretend I'm Tristan coming back from World War I with the scalps.  Oh, you're disgusting in love.  She's my little Indian girl who grew up, and she's pregnant with my girl.  And actually, I get shot with a ricochet bullet off the mountain.  Oh, our baby.  Holy Jesus.  You rule, Pat.  I watched the fifth element.  I said, you're the fifth element.  That's love.  Let's stop that fireball of evil coming at birth. 
[01:18:00]  Where's she now?  Still tied up in the trailer?  Yeah.  She's here.  Oh.  Do we get to meet her?  Can we meet her?  Why is she nice?  We'll be nice, and be courteous, Opie.  We'll be nice.  Don't look at me.  I'm looking at you.  Opie, don't look at me.  I'm looking at you.  Be nice.  I'll be nice.  I'll march right out of here.  Oh, see?  Oh.  He's our ringer, too. 
[01:18:30]  I thought the old squeeze play.  He's our ringer.  And we might know this girl?  Yeah.  You might have seen her before.  All right.  All right.  Bring her in.  Is it Paul's wife, Denise?  No.  No.  I'm not a boob man.  Can you say that?  You're a boob.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  Man.  Well.  That's super, man.  All right.  A little scared.  You stopped.  Yeah.  We're going to get the eggnark drinking contest started very, very soon. 
[01:19:00]  Right around 7 o'clock.  Where's the lovely?  She's walking in the door, I guess.  It's Big Cat.  Why is E-Rox smiling real wide?  Here's Pat from Monoclea's dick.  E-Rox retarded.  Hi.  Hi.  She's my friend I spend time with.  How are you?  How are you?  Hello.  Good.  Hello.  Got a microphone there.  You do look familiar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trying to place it, Pat.  Trying to place.  I'm not that good.  Opie's great with faces and memories. 
[01:19:30]  He's pretty good.  No?  Nothing?  She's got a cute little Christmas hat on.  I got that for her yesterday.  She's a pretty girl.  Yes.  And the hat is, it's got like glowing, it's like a circle, a circle of stars.  Yeah, so Pat can see her from like time on.  So we can.  So Pat, yeah.  So she's running down the street in the dark.  He knows who to tackle.  When she's in the woods yelling, help me.  He'll use that glowing hat.  So I get those infrared glasses.  So you're Pat all the time. 
[01:20:00]  Do the moths flying around bother you?  Or the girl in the well?  The girl in the well.  Wait a minute.  So how did you meet Pat?  How did we meet?  Well, first, Pal Talk.  Yeah.  Yeah, that old Pal Talk, man.  I got to tell you.  You got to love.  Love is in the air on Pal Talk.  So you met on Pal Talk.  What was it?  In the O&A fan room? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the live room.  The live room.  The live room, okay, at first.  Right.  And then did you, how, because there are so many people.  I don't understand how you like zero one out like a gazelle on the plains of the Serengeti.  How did you decide this one is any different than any of the other girls that won't talk to you?  No, actually, I met her at, like, a Pal Talk O&A thing.  Yeah.  Oh.  Maybe F.H. Riley's?  No, not that one.  Hey, did you say F.H. Riley's?  And a place in Huntington, right? 
[01:21:00]  My brother's restaurant.  All right.  And my restaurant.  Of course.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  Who doesn't know that, Opie?  F.H. Riley's, that's right.  And we all know what the F.H. stands for.  Right.  Now, so you met on Pal Talk.  Yes.  And how did it develop from there?  Well, I met her at that little Pal Talk function, and we got to talking, and then we spent time.  And then we moved down here.  Yeah.  And stayed.  Yeah.  Oh, you moved? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Missouri.  Where were you?  Missouri.  Missouri?  Yes.  Did you move down here because of business or for Pat?  For Pat.  Yeah.  You moved for Pat?  Yes.  That is sweet.  And you're living in his trailer?  No.  No.  Well, you're not living in his...  Did you move out of your trailer, or you get, like, what's...  Where are you living?  Uh, I'm living in my trailer, Jim.  She's staying with a friend, and is the...  I gotta ask, is this friend a guy?  Yes.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus and baby Jesus.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's okay.  It's platonic.  Is the guy, friend gay?  No.  All right.  That would have been the only...  I'm hoping.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  It's all right.  I could kick his butt.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I go over there every day, and I make sure.  I give him the eye.  Well, what's your name?  Tanya.  Tanya.  And are you in love with Pat?  We're good friends. 
[01:22:30]  I love you, Pat.  See?  Oh.  That's it.  It's Christmas.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  I just want you to...  I want you to...  I love you.  I love you.  Oh, God.  Pat, I want you to...  It's like I was playing handball.  Just bounce back at me.  It's going to end in a suicide.  Pat, I got to tell you, please slow down.  Someone has to say it.  Slow down.  It's suicide.  I'm getting intel.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting intel here. 
[01:23:00]  I happen to know where she lives.  Oh, really?  I'm shocked.  I happen to know where she lives.  Oh, please, God.  Now, how did this living arrangement come about?  Just...  I don't really know.  Was it an offer by this gentleman?  Yes.  That you live?  Yes.  Did you move up here because of Pat or because of an offer that you had a place to stay?  I came up... 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, an offer for a place to stay.  An offer for a place to stay.  Yes.  Now, did this gentleman contact you before or after Pat?  We all...  I think I knew him before you, but...  Yes.  Okay.  And then he came over one day to his house, and then we all became, like, the three Musketeers.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't want the...  We spent Thanksgiving together.  You don't want the three Musketeers in a relationship, Pat.  The important question is...  You don't.  Does the other guy like you?  Yep, Desk.  I don't know.  Of course he does. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  This is going to end in a suicide.  Women always know.  Women always know.  They give me a sense.  Got it.  Our rendezvous.  Freeze company, too.  Let me tell you why.  Yeah, go ahead.  There's a problem.  Make it...  We met at the Regal Beagle.  Hold on.  They're all over it on PalTalk.  They're all over it on feedback and on the phones, but you've got to explain it to the  rest of America there, Anthony.  Would you like to maybe reside at my house?  I believe I could put a roof over your head, give you a place to stay and some food. 
[01:24:30]  We could watch Tom and Jerry cartoons.  It's more like...  I got the box set.  Perhaps I could use you as a dependent and write you off on my taxes.  Perhaps you could help build a dojo.  So it's true you live with Master Poe.  Yes.  You live with Master Poe.  Who's one of the protectors of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Master Poe, who, you know, with all due respect to Master Poe, is one of the biggest perverts 
[01:25:00]  I've ever seen in my life.  Is Poe a pervert?  The guy will try to pick up any girl on two legs.  And he doesn't even bother taking him back home.  He just, you know, does what he has to do in the parking lot.  Of where?  F.H. Riley's.  F.H. Riley's in Huntington.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village, my brother's restaurant.  I've never seen our guys uncomfortable before.  Sam and Danny and Nathaniel are all uncomfortable.  It's not going to be a walkover today. 
[01:25:30]  It's going to be a walk away.  Oh, people are wondering if Pat enjoyed the free turkey that was supposed to be my turkey.  You had a celebrity turkey at Thanksgiving.  All right, listen.  My turkey.  So, Pat from Menachie, you're in love.  Yes.  I'd like to say that to the world.  She's not quite in love with you.  But you're hoping that she might see it your way.  She's living with Master Poe.  Who's got to be getting naked with her on a nightly basis. 
[01:26:00]  What are the sleeping arrangements?  Well, you got to...  My thing went off.  What have I...  The headphones went off?  The headphones aren't working?  Can we fix them?  Because we definitely wanted to hear this.  Yeah.  I just want to know what the sleeping arrangements are over at the Poe Compound.  There's a fold-out bed.  I want to hear from her.  When he sleeps upstairs in a bed, I sleep on a couch.  If he falls asleep on a couch, I sleep upstairs in the bed.  With the dogs. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  We've heard about his dogs.  So, it's an upstairs-downstairs thing all the time.  Right.  Yes.  Am I getting a little personal?  You don't have to answer.  Has there ever been cohabitation of a sleeping environment at the Poe House?  No.  Pat.  That's question-walking.  Pat is, yeah, just like, no.  We all spoon.  We all spoon.  Poe tries to fork me.  Do you guys kiss or anything? 
[01:27:00]  There's been friendly little, you know.  But Pat's saying that he's in love.  Yeah.  Do you understand that Pat is head over heels completely as far as a guy could be in love  with somebody?  He is in love with you.  Yes.  He tells me that daily.  He does.  Yes.  And you, what are your true feelings right now for Pat?  He's like my best friend.  I do anything for him.  Well. 
[01:27:30]  I'm not in love with him.  But you're not in love with him.  Right.  Do you think in the future that something can change, that these things can change, and  that maybe you could have feelings for Pat like he has for you?  I don't know.  We'll see.  See?  That sounds good to me.  That is a really, really nice note.  We went to FAO Schwartz yesterday and danced on the big piano.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Pat.  Oh, no.  Oh, Pat.  Stan's holding up a break sign, and it's for Pat's heart. 
[01:28:00]  Because I just see this really ending tragic.  This has all the ingredients of a car bomb.  It really does.  I'm trying to think for a shark, and I said, this.  Tanya, she broke my heart.  Yeah.  I'm thinking this ends in double murder-suicide.  Murder-suicide.  Double murder-suicide.  Double murder-suicide.  Poe, Tanya, and Pat.  And then Pat puts the gun in his mouth. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Do it in the mouth.  Can you guys kiss before we take a break?  Can you kiss before we take a break?  Aw, come here.  Aw, look.  Here we go.  This will say a lot.  She goes.  She went, ma.  Mwah.  Whenever there's a noise after the kiss, it's not good.  And then the pat on the back.  Like, when you give the hug, it's like, pat.  Jimmy's so right.  If there's a noise after the kiss, forget it.  Yeah.  Forget it, Pat.  For your gunshot.  Pat, listen to your pals.  Forget it. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, Pat.  I'm sorry.  Remain friends.  I have no choice.  They're saying, run, Pat.  I got to say, I was friends with someone for three years, and I liked her the whole time,  and it didn't happen at first, so it's not crazy.  Yeah.  She turned me down a year before.  Yeah.  Let's see what happened during that time.  Jim Norton gets a TV show.  Jim Norton on a popular radio show.  Jim Norton moves to a posh apartment uptown.  Jim Norton has a steady income. 
[01:29:30]  Jim Norton loses weight.  All that means Jim Norton not really loved.  Circumstantially, Jim Norton improved.  The garbage that he is has not.  Jim Norton constantly explaining past.  I didn't really.  That didn't happen.  Jim Norton constantly diverting her away from message boards.  All right, Pat.  She's not attracted to me now, but I'm going to lose 80 pounds in the next three months.  Did you know that Pat, because women always know, did you know he was attracted to you?  Well, yeah, he told me, yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Before he told you, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, he told you that he was attracted to you.  He's always saying, oh, hot, and we have a song, so he's always like, points it at me.  I never listen to words of songs.  I go, oh, that's you and me.  What's the song?  A lot of them.  Well, the one, what's the one we sing all the time in the car?  All Right Now.  All Right Now.  Baby, it's all right now.  Because it's all right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  She's arrived in your life.  Bad company.  All it means to her is that you're not making a left turn. 
[01:30:30]  I take what I want.  Baby, I want you.  There you go.  This is nothing but trouble, Pat.  I just see nothing but trouble burning in flames.  Right.  We got to take a break.  All right, we got to take a break.  When we get back, we're going to start the eggnog drinking contest.  Maybe we'll learn a little more about this disaster.  That is Pat's first attempt.  His first attempt at love.  Wait, wait, wait.  You've been in love before, right? 
[01:31:00]  No.  You know what?  Looking back, in retrospect, I've been infatuated before, but never in love.  This is the same thing.  Totally different.  Yeah.  We have to take a break.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  I really want to ask Pat questions.  Yeah, we will.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  By a long shot.  We're going to start drinking the eggnog next, okay?  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's a very busy morning on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:31:30]  Getting ready for the eggnog drinking contest.  Want to thank Elmhurst Dairy in Elmhurst, New York, for all the eggnogs.  We got crates and crates and crates of eggnog today for the eggnog drinking contest.  We got Bill Burr's studio.  Bill was telling me off mic that he's been waiting a year for today.  Yes.  Who hasn't?  No, just a whole year listening to Pat from Munaki puke.  That's like the funniest audio ever.  Isn't that great?  I've actually been trying to explain it to people. 
[01:32:00]  That sound is that gurgling, sucking chest wound kind of sound.  A gallon of eggnog hitting a hefty bag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  And we learned that Pat from Munaki is in love with someone that's not in love with him.  During the break, I hope the rest of America understands.  We're all just walking around going, oh, God, no.  Oh, no.  This is just going to end in a suicide.  Yeah, it's going to be bad.  You can't explain.  I was trying to tell my girlfriend about the audio of the puke, and you cannot explain 
[01:32:30]  to a girl the beauty of vomit audio.  There's no way to make that translate across the country.  The chicks just don't dig vomit audio.  No, it's almost like Three Stooges type thing or, you know, it's just a girl gene.  You think puke, it's a form of slapstick?  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  It's one of those things that girls just go, I don't get it.  It's disgusting.  I don't get it.  Why don't you go grow up?  It's just stupid.  I watched Jackass 2, and there is a scene where Steve-O is wearing some kind of space 
[01:33:00]  helmet thing, and he pukes in it.  And it's a glass fishbowl, pretty much, on his head, and he's vomiting into it, and it's  filling up with puke.  And I'm roaring.  It is just the funniest thing.  And girls, like, just don't find that funny.  I don't know why I find it funny, but it just is.  She comes running in.  She thinks she's watching, like, Sleepless in Seattle.  Tom Hanks said something cute.  And all you're getting is this. 
[01:33:30]  And laughter.  Guys are pretty simple.  By the way, professional camera dude, where are you from?  I'm at HDNet.  HDNet is filming the eggnog drinking contest?  Yes, we are.  We're going to have details on when this is going to air?  Absolutely.  All right.  We'll keep everyone informed, but we've got a real camera dude in today.  Yes.  HDNet helping us out today.  All right.  Bring in the contestants.  You know, puking in widescreen, that's what it's all about, right?  And high def, so you'll know exactly what they had for dinner last night. 
[01:34:00]  High def digital video.  Hey, I see some familiar faces.  Sergeant Magoo.  We got...  Ah, there's Sergeant Magoo.  What a show he put on for the Pal Talkers yesterday.  Did you hear about this, Bill?  Uh-uh.  Yesterday on Pal Talks, Sergeant Magoo, we had a lot of people come in and audition for  this because we want real contenders, not these slouches that are going to come in and  be out in the first two shots.  Sergeant Magoo on Pal Talk was home drinking milk, eating sticks of butter with ketchup on 
[01:34:30]  it.  Oh, my God.  And vomiting into Tupperware, which he then, filled with Froot Loops, got a big spoon and  started eating.  It was fantastic.  It was like I was watching Ali back in the late 60s, early 70s, kind of that type of champion.  This is a man who obviously wants to win and has what it takes to win this competition.  I like how they gave him the shoulder holster taping of his name. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  What the hell are you guys doing?  Taping name tags on these people.  All right.  Hey, where is that video, by the way, Sergeant Magoo?  Right now, one person that was filming, it got messed up, so we're trying to get the  other people to get it up online right now.  By the way, not just name tags.  I asked for Stars of David.  Why don't I get what I...  We're trying to get on right now.  Yeah, the mic is a little low.  What are we doing over there?  We need a little more volume.  I'm pinned over here.  All right.  We also have Doug Out Doug is here from a fine website. 
[01:35:30]  Who else we got we want to talk to?  We got Flea back there, I see.  He was putting on a show the other day for us.  Yeah, Flea, how you doing?  Doing pretty good.  Skinny little bastard.  You think you got a shot at this?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  No, you don't.  He drank a lot.  He drank a quart of milk, and then he drank a quart of half and half, and he drank a quart  of heavy cream.  He did boof.  He did puke, but you kept drinking.  Yep.  You do know if you puke here, you're out.  There's no buyback.  You can't buy back in. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, the contest is really easy.  These guys are going to drink a double shot of eggnog every single minute until they puke.  When they puke, they are out of the competition.  How many contestants we're going with, guys?  We got what, about 10 or so?  10.  All right, we got 10 contestants.  Since I see Pat, of course, the favorite.  Pat from Minaki has got to be the favorite.  But love might put a damper on his competitive spirit with this whole thing.  He might have to, you know, fill his, oh, what?  Oh, yeah, a girl contest. 
[01:36:30]  Thanks, Steve.  We got any money going on?  Anything going on here?  There's a little action, a little side action.  Side action.  People are betting in their cubicles right now, Bill.  But this is purely for just the...  You don't condone that kind of activity.  No, we don't condone betting when it comes to eggnog drinking until you puke.  Why would we?  It's about dignity.  It's not about betting and money.  I can't pick a favorite.  You need some little skinny Asian guy.  They're the ones who always...  Oh, you got the skinny flea.  Favorite was Pat.  And we got a chick this year. 
[01:37:00]  I don't think we've ever had a chick in the eggnog drinking contest.  You are the first, huh?  Who are you?  My name is May.  I live here in New York.  Hey, May.  Thank you.  Big fan of the show?  Absolutely.  Who put your tape on, by the way?  Made sure it went right over your left breast.  Master Poe.  Yeah.  Master Poe in the parking lot.  So, I think this is like...  I listened to it last year, year before.  Yeah.  You really think you can get some shots down?  Yeah, I think I'm... 
[01:37:30]  How many do you think you're good for?  I can probably do about 30.  30?  Are you a woofer?  I'm just a big eater.  Can you puke, though, without a problem?  Yeah, I just usually don't puke.  You don't puke.  All right, well, this is something that a lot of people that have never puked...  And she's confusing the audience.  She's saying she's a big eater, but you're not a big girl.  No, I'm just a big eater.  And, by the way, someone has to say you have a lovely set there.  Thank you.  All the way, May.  Oh, hey.  Hey, hey!  All the way, May.  Leave all the way, May out of this today. 
[01:38:00]  We're just saying maybe she'll be the champ and go all the way.  Hey!  Not like you're all the way, May.  You're a great aunt.  Nice staying on the back seat that a helicopter could land on.  Bill, remember the show where they went after your grandmother?  Was it your grandmother?  Yes, it was.  Where the abuse was brutal?  Well, now they're doing it to my great aunt.  His great aunt is the actual All the Way May, the character that Madonna played in League  of Their Own.  His great aunt was the actual one.  It's a true story.  She's a nun now to try to make up for all the... 
[01:38:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Well, you know all the gentlemen were off fighting a war, so God knows what she was with.  No, All the Way May.  Meets, retards, cripples, and the entire Negro League.  People with flat feet.  Flat feet.  Bill!  Bill!  Bill!  Flat footprints on the Studebaker windshield.  You know how much this could hurt.  Don't go there.  This hurts.  It's All the Way May because she was a really good hitter, that's all.  And she went around the bases a lot.  Yeah, she sure did. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Heard a song about it once with Phil Rizzuto in it.  All right, who else do we want to talk to?  Pat wanted to say something while the girl was talking.  Oh, Pat.  Pat had something.  Are you in love with her, too, now?  No, I was just going to say, well, before you said it, I said, I think May's going to  go all the way, so.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  So, yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  Was your first born named 4F?  All right.  Wow.  Now, Pat was the favorite right up until today, for me, anyway.  I would have put all my money on Pat. 
[01:39:30]  I think this love thing is going to screw you up.  I also think...  It's filled up with love.  It's going to be in the back of your head that she's making out with somebody else in the  hallway.  You've got to be honest.  What?  Did you hear something?  You've got to be honest.  You're going to be really distracted.  You're going to be thinking the whole time, God, is she flirting or making out with someone  in the hallway as I try to impress her by drinking a lot of eggnog today?  What did you hear?  And who's the guy in the blue in the back?  Yeah.  Now, here's a guy that I'm thinking there might be a problem with.  Huh?  Jerry.  What's up, Jerry?  What's your story? 
[01:40:00]  Jerry.  Just listening to the radio.  Yeah.  I'm going to drink a lot of eggnog.  Puke.  Doug is saying, turn around.  Why turn around?  I'm saturated.  Oh, wow.  You're sweating.  You're sweating.  Are you sweating?  A little nervous.  You're about six, what?  Four?  Six six.  Six six?  Okay.  And how much do you weigh?  460.  460.  Wow.  He's our biggest competitor.  He doesn't look 460, though.  You don't look 460.  Because he's a very tall guy.  Yeah, that's true.  He looks 380.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He smelt 380.  Now, have you done anything as far as eating a lot? 
[01:40:30]  You think?  Not on a daily basis.  He knows you think.  But I mean.  He only eats one meal a day, but it's a water buffalo.  What do you think your chances are?  I think they're pretty good.  Pretty good?  Yeah.  I did six pitchers of beer in an hour and didn't blow.  Wow.  Pat, you're in trouble.  Six pitchers in an hour.  All right, Pat.  I like this guy loosening up his neck right there with the psycho haircut.  Oh, my God.  Who's this little fella?  Psycho.  Who are you?  What's up? 
[01:41:00]  I was here last week.  I was shopping for milk.  Oh, yeah.  You're the milk guy.  All right.  I didn't see it.  You just spiked his hair up a little more.  Yeah.  Your video's up on YouTube.  It's getting viewed pretty well.  I can find it.  Yeah, it's up there.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Good deal.  All right.  Anybody else we want to talk to?  I see Sergeant Magoo has his Froot Loops just in case he pukes.  Yeah, Sergeant Magoo, step up to him, Mike.  Yeah, you brought the Froot Loops now.  In case you puke, you're going to reenact what you did on Pal Talk with the Froot Loops.  Hey, I'm here to entertain.  We're going to have some fun today, so I'll do whatever needs to be done.  Well, no, whatever, but some fun. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Anybody else we want to talk to?  Anyone else have an interesting story?  Who's the guy in the back there that we didn't speak to?  Your name, sir?  Hi, I'm Shane.  Hi, Shane.  You're Shane.  I'm going to win it all.  Oh, really?  You think you're kind of just the Richard Dreyfuss?  I'm a closet eater.  Whose colon is it anyway?  You're a closet eater?  I'm a closet eater, man.  Me and my friends have little competitions.  I always beat them, so I figure bring it out to the main stage.  Really?  Yep. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  That's that faux confidence I've seen so many times.  Yeah, we've seen it over the years.  It's refreshing, because then after a few shots, you ask him, how are you doing?  He goes, well, it could be a problem.  No, no, no.  Absolutely not.  All right.  All right.  I think we're ready, Anthony.  All the confidence.  Who are you picking?  God, I want to go with Pat so bad.  This love thing has gotten me.  Has Pat won it yet?  Yeah, the first one.  He won the first one, and he should have won.  Oh, last year.  Last year, he set the record, but lost the contest.  Oh, he lost.  It's a weird thing where he took the shot that put him over the top. 
[01:42:30]  He had more shots than the other guy.  There were only two left, but he puked before the other guy puked.  It's all about who pukes first.  Who pukes first.  You've got a minute to do that shot, and Badlands decided he was going to sit and wait, wait  it out, when Pat did the shot immediately.  Then Pat puked.  Badlands didn't have to do the shot.  Wow.  And then he puked pretty much right after Pat.  It was bad close last year.  It was just so close.  Hey, Pat, what's the record?  71 is 71.  A checkered flag.  Right.  Same thing. 
[01:43:00]  Sorry.  Sorry everyone's talking.  I'm sorry about that.  I was yelling over you guys.  But the record is 71 double shots of eggnog.  That's what we're looking for today.  Do we have an organized squad that can fill all these cups in the allotted time?  All right.  We own two guys.  Didn't we have more last time?  I don't like this.  We might want to get a third guy.  Just in case.  Just in case.  If there's a problem on the first round, make sure we get some ready reserve in there.  They look like they're going to go Christmas caroling.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:43:30]  Here's the deal.  Just to set it up for everybody at home.  It's the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  We've got puke buckets all over the studio.  We've got tons of eggnog.  These guys will do a double shot of eggnog every single minute until they puke.  They puke.  They're out.  Until one guy is standing.  And they will be doing it through commercial break.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to take a break.  Will we talk to you?  No.  Oh, okay.  We didn't talk to him.  Amish beard.  Real quick.  What's your name, sir?  My name's Pat.  Pat.  And where do you hail from?  I hail from New Jersey.  I was going to say Jersey. 
[01:44:00]  Ah, geez.  God, Jersey is just, you could see it a mile away.  And what's your story?  I go to the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Good old CSB.  And I want to intern here, but I figured this would be the better way of doing it rather than  just applying.  Not bad.  All right.  Not bad.  Make sure you leave your info with Steve or somebody, you know, after you puke.  And Rogan is out.  Yeah.  Joe Rogan is joining the party, too.  All right.  Here we go.  Why don't we get the contest going?  We talked to you enough. 
[01:44:30]  Flea shit up.  I got one quick check.  What do you got?  One quick check.  If I lose, Joe Rogan can choke me out.  You're going to lose, and he should choke you out either way.  Hey, Joe, would you choke out Flea for us?  All right.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Do you know what type of that?  I am saying that would make YouTube history as far as hits.  Joe Rogan choking somebody out.  A skinny little bastard-like Flea.  I've already been choked a radio guy out on YouTube once.  Really?  Yeah.  Some guy from Boston. 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  Is it Mark Parenteau for hitting on you?  Can we choke out Flea before the competition?  It's probably not the best move.  All right.  Well, Anthony, why don't we get this going?  Who wants to start this up?  Hey, yo, can I do a toast?  Oh, Doug?  Can I toast it?  Yeah, Doug out, Doug, from OAXperience.com.  Big Rich DeSolofist.  DeSolofist.  I can't say the name either.  No one was able to.  Gone but not forgotten.  Maybe worm food, but we're going to toast you today, Rich.  Yeah, we lost one of our faithful listeners, 
[01:45:30]  and he has the worst name to try to say on the radio.  DeSolofist.  But he was a great guy,  and he was at every single Opie and Anthony event that we ever did.  So right on, Doug.  Good move.  All right.  Let's get the eggnog drinking contest.  Where's this going?  Oh, yeah.  Pat.  Tanya, this one's for you, baby.  Oh, it's over.  Dude, she's making out with someone in the hall.  She's not even listening to you.  Oh, no.  All right.  Start drinking.  The eggnog drinking contest has officially begun.  There's going to be something on our shirt,  and he's going to go,  were you in the eggnog drinking competition, too? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, they did.  All right.  And all you have to do, guys,  is drink a double shot of eggnog every single minute.  They all got their first shot down, obviously.  They're holding their second one.  Refilling.  First shot, piece of cake.  Yeah.  This is like, who wants to be a millionaire?  You know, the first few questions, what's your name?  Kind of like that for the $100.  Eh, first couple, you just know it's going to go fine.  But then after a while, you start seeing faces. 
[01:46:30]  What do you think?  Third shot or fourth shot?  When does it start coming in?  Nah, it's usually around...  They'll get up to 10 with not even a problem.  Yeah, anywhere between 5 and 10,  you start seeing a face.  And that's when you know to get the guy to the mic  because he's going to start going,  no, I'm okay, I'm okay.  But you see a face.  Yeah, by the way, speaking of that, Anthony,  if you are going to puke,  you've got to be a good sport and help us all out.  Make sure you raise your hand  so we can get some great audio of you puking.  Yeah.  All right, time for the second shot. 
[01:47:00]  And there they go, the second shot.  Well, that minute goes really quickly.  All right, I'm looking at different drinking styles.  Pat just sucks it right down.  Flea took two separate swigs.  Yeah?  Yeah, flea is...  It's thicker than I expected.  It's too small.  Is it thicker than you expected?  Yeah.  I don't know what's wrong.  It's eggnog.  You know what, this is like the first week  of Navy SEAL training  where everybody thinks they're going to make it.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I can hack this.  I can hack this.  I'm going to be special forces.  And by the end, there's eight guys left out of 2,000. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  Anthony, you know what we should do?  We should take a break.  We'll get them to do the third shot.  They'll continue through the break,  and then we'll see where we're at  when we get back with the radio show.  How does that sound?  All right.  Get ready.  Here we go.  The third double shot of eggnog.  And go!  Here it goes.  Let me see the technique.  Sergeant Magoo pacing himself.  Doug puts it right down.  He's licking his lips. 
[01:48:00]  He's smacking him.  How's the lady doing?  She just puts it right down, too.  Okay.  Nah, it's way too early.  So why don't we take a break?  By the time we get back from break,  there'll be close to 10 shots of eggnog.  10 double shots of eggnog.  It's the Eggnog Drinking Contest  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the annual Eggnog Challenge  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  on the Rock of New York,  92.3 K-Rock.  Coming up after O&A,  at least 92 minutes of nonstop rock 
[01:48:30]  to start your work day.  92 minutes nonstop.  Every weekday nine, K-Rock.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  We now return to the Opie and Anthony  Eggnog Challenge.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're in the middle of the  Eggnog Drinking Contest.  Starting to heat up.  The action's starting to heat up. 
[01:49:00]  I'm at this studio.  It's already, I swear to you,  it's already starting to smell like  like A in here.  Like swamp ass.  Yeah, there's swamp ass going on in here.  Somebody is guilty of having it.  Well, there's a lot of guys,  they're nervous.  They're nervous because they're on a live radio show  and they're drinking the Eggnog  and they're back to begin with.  Flea.  What about Flea?  Who is it?  Flea man has swamp ass?  Flea, what's going on with... 
[01:49:30]  Who's got a...  Flea.  Do you have swamp ass?  They're drinking their shot.  Who is it?  Are they saying flea smells?  It's flea?  We need somebody to confirm that.  I don't know.  He walked over here about five minutes ago  and I smelled the most wretched smell  since this whole thing started.  And I was standing by the big guy,  Jerry, back there.  His pits smell so bad,  he must have not showered.  Who?  Dude, I swear,  I'm smelling things that are  really, really bad.  Because he knows he's going to get choked out 
[01:50:00]  in about three minutes.  It's swamp ass.  The smell I've ever smelt, Flea.  By the way,  for the rest of America,  Flea weighs...  How much do you weigh, Flea?  130 tops?  No, I weigh about 155.  Do you?  Ooh.  All right.  And you're going to get choked out  by Joe Rogan  when you lose the eggnog drinking contest, right?  Yeah, I will.  All right.  And Doug Outdug's not happy  with the smell  that is emanating from Flea.  Wow.  Yeah, let me have that.  And we're starting to spray the Lysol.  All right, where are we at?  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  These guys are drinking 
[01:50:30]  a double shot of eggnog  every single minute.  How many shots  have they done, Steve?  They've done 14.  Kev's pouring the 15th one now.  They've done 14 double shots  of eggnog.  He rocks Flea.  Flea down with Lysol.  Hey, let's see how Pat's doing, Anthony.  Pat.  Oh, I'm doing just fine.  No problem so far?  No.  Anybody having a problem?  Of course, Flea already.  The cockiest one  is the only one  having a problem so far.  What's the problem, Flea? 
[01:51:00]  This thing.  Oh.  Hey!  Oh!  Put your head down!  Too much.  That was it.  That was a little bit.  A little bit.  That was like a burp.  What?  Wait a minute.  We need a judge.  Is he out of the...  It wasn't a puke.  It wasn't a puke?  Did he get both feet inbound?  I think he kind of burped and...  Oh, wait.  Ah, he's out.  That's no burp.  I got...  I tried to single you.  Yeah, but you're not drinking it.  You can't just hold it in your mouth  and spit it out to you, 
[01:51:30]  but it's not a date.  Yeah, that wasn't really puking.  Flea's out?  All right, Flea.  Yeah.  I'll choke out.  Choke out.  That's it.  Flea is out of the eggnog drinking contest.  Yeah, he wants to be choked.  Flea's the first one.  Flea is only here for Rogan to choke him out.  Where you going, Flea?  You got to keep your pants on, dude.  Yeah.  Now?  Now, when do you want to do it?  I thought we'd be out.  All right, after.  Get out of the studio.  We got to make room.  So, we have to say goodbye to Flea.  How many double shots did he almost do?  15? 
[01:52:00]  He's out after 15?  Yep.  All right, we're down to nine competitors.  Anybody else feeling a little queasy?  If he's going to get choked out,  he should throw up.  Anyone feeling, what, full?  Getting a little full.  It's very thick, but...  Yeah.  Very thick.  Sergeant Magoo saying it's very thick.  It's getting full.  Did you eat?  Before you came here?  No, I did not.  I planned on eating here.  Yeah?  Shot time, by the way.  Awful.  Shot time, by the way.  There he goes.  Eggnog.  Is that the dude that had to throw up with the...  Yeah, that's him.  The Froot Loops. 
[01:52:30]  The Froot Loops, yeah.  He brought his Froot Loops, so he's going to give us a little sideshow later.  Are you really going to eat your own puke with Froot Loops?  He did it yesterday.  He carries those Froot Loops like little John Kelly.  Carries that stupid little cup.  That's his own thing now.  Magoo with some Froot Loops.  I feel like I only have 55 more in me.  Yeah.  You heard that last year.  Hey, and he was right, though.  Yeah.  Pat did 72 double shots of eggnog last year.  We'll see if he...  71.  Sorry.  I keep saying 72.  71 double shots of eggnog. 
[01:53:00]  That is the current record.  We'll see if anyone beats that this year.  All right.  Where are we at, Dan?  Got another shot in about 10 seconds.  All right.  And this will be...  This will be number 17.  Number 17.  This is going to be the 17th double shot of eggnog.  I think Pat's kind of making a little face like is a little bit of a problem.  It's starting to suck a little bit.  You kind of winced when another shot was announced.  Pat?  Yeah.  Not Pat from Monaki.  Pat Duffy.  Creepy beard Pat. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Pat is a...  Loser Pat.  He kind of wins.  A loser Pat.  What about growing up gaudy?  How's he doing?  Which one?  With the spiked hair.  Oh, there you go.  How you doing?  Fine.  I'm just glad I love eggnog.  Yeah.  You really like the eggnog, huh?  A little coat in the stomach now.  And what about a big guy?  How you doing back there?  That's a big fella.  Barely feel it.  Yeah.  He's 6'6".  4...  What was it?  4'60?  4'60.  That's nothing for him.  Yeah, okay.  And Doug? 
[01:54:00]  How you feeling?  Doing well.  Doing well.  I love the eggnog.  I've been drinking it all week.  Oh, you've been practicing?  Yeah, I've been drinking, what is it, half a gallon a night.  I've put on like 5 pounds in the past week.  Yeah.  Good Lord.  Wow.  What is his blood sugar right now?  That's awful.  That would be the real contest.  You've been training for this?  Yeah, these guys...  Joe, this is a big thing every year.  This is my first time ever trying eggnog.  Huh?  My first time ever trying eggnog.  Really?  It's delicious.  Sergeant Magoo doesn't even have a chance.  He's here to do the Fruit Loop trick later. 
[01:54:30]  I want to do it at his own throw up in front of people.  We're just waiting for the throw up to happen.  Do we got a bowl?  We got a bowl for Sergeant Magoo?  Oh, a pitcher.  Oh, that is going to really sound horrid.  I'm looking at Pat Duffy over there, and that last shot really was hard.  I probably got another five minutes left.  That's about it.  I love nog, though.  That's the thing.  Huh?  I love nog.  It's so good.  It just sucks so bad when there's so much.  When it comes back, you'll be able to taste it all over again.  Yeah, because I noticed he kind of started drinking that down. 
[01:55:00]  He had to stop.  He had to, like, swallow.  He winced a little and then finished it.  So, if you're at that point now, you're in trouble.  That's not a lot of time.  Uh-oh.  I got a little pre-puke belch over there.  Yeah.  Which guy?  Which guy?  Just trying to get rid of gases so I can fit more room.  Sergeant McGill is burping, which is a prelude.  We all know that.  Just a little air in the line.  Uh, what about our young lady?  Uh, how are you feeling?  I have a sugar rush, so I'm... 
[01:55:30]  Oh, cool.  Yeah?  She's way too much than I'm used to.  Shot.  She has.  Shot.  Shot, guys.  I messed up.  She's got your eyes.  Hold on, honey.  Just, Jimmy.  She also has a burn victim wig hair.  Oh, yeah.  How many double shots are we up to?  They just did their 19th double shot of egg nudge.  Joe, what do you think so far?  Joe Rogan in studio.  Fascinating so far.  I'm just waiting to see the Magoo. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, we're all waiting for Sergeant Magoo to eat Fruit Loops and puke.  Kevin's getting weak.  You do realize Joe Rogan hosts Fear Factor.  Oh, yeah.  Why am I at this?  This to him is like kindergarten.  Yeah, you're right.  This is nothing.  I forgot who I was talking to.  It just bothers...  It doesn't even bother me.  All right.  Wait a minute.  You need diced cow intestines inside the egg nudge.  We've talked to him over the years.  Will it bother you when you see Sergeant Magoo puke into a pitcher, then add Fruit Loops and eat that?  Yes, that will bother you.  That will be up there, right? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right, good.  Anybody eating their own puke, that's hardcore.  How about if Magoo ate someone else's puke?  That's even more hardcore.  All right.  Watch how many people start puking after Sergeant Magoo eats the Fruit Loops in his own puke.  Especially being all queasy.  Uh-oh, we got it, girl.  Uh-oh.  What's happening?  We might be losing somebody.  It's way too much eggnog.  Come on, chug it.  Chug it.  You got it.  You got it.  Chug it down.  All right, we might be losing the only female in the competition.  There you go.  All right.  Yeah, she's still in. 
[01:57:00]  You got to do it for the ladies.  Yeah.  Come on.  We want to see a girl puke so bad.  That's right.  There you go.  There's a whole other glass for you.  Right after that one.  She had a real tough time down in that one.  The beauty of this contest, it starts off where everyone's like, oh, it's a piece of cake.  Yeah, I got it.  Double shot every minute, and then that minute starts coming by way too fast.  What are we up to?  This is the 20th?  It's the 21st.  21st double shot of eggnog.  And here we go.  Wow.  Okay, she's having a hard time.  Oh, boy.  She's sipping.  Keep that mic ready, young Dan. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, they're getting the mics ready and everything.  You know what?  You got to just pound it.  It's the only way to do it.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow, that was hot.  Pat's already trying to find his new girlfriend.  His current one is making out with somebody in the hall.  Uh-oh, we got another.  We might lose a couple guys here.  Pat.  Oh, Pat.  Oh, Pat.  Oh, nice. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  It's so cold. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I bow to you today.  Did he drink a gallon before you came here?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  Can I get an intern job?  Oh, that's the intern.  Yes, hire him. 
[01:59:00]  Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy is out.  What's your name again?  Pat.  That was Pat?  That's going to be Pat.  Pat, we've been doing this.  Hold on, we've been doing this for three years?  I've never seen anyone puke that much.  That was power booting.  That could be the best puke we've seen in three years.  Power booting.  It's fear factor for six seasons.  I never saw anybody throw up like that.  That was some puking, man.  I'll throw up on the street on the walkover.  All right.  Yes.  Oh, God, yes.  That'll be fine.  Don't count me out yet.  Dude, congrats.  You have probably the best puke sound effect. 
[01:59:30]  That's awesome.  By the way, it sounded like it was on loop.  Yeah.  No, that was one guy puking over and over again.  By the way.  With the exact same noise.  By the way, we did a really good job there.  When these guys start puking, we've got to try to stay as quiet as possible.  Yeah, it's really hard.  It really is hard because it is so freaking fun.  How's May doing?  She's done.  May?  You're out, May?  Yeah.  All right.  By the way, the guys had to continue drinking double shots of eggnog during that whole mess.  So let's see where we're at. 
[02:00:00]  We lost Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy that we're going to hire for an intern.  Awesome.  And I guess we lose our only female competitor, May, there.  Oh, May, you're out, huh?  All right.  Guys, can't take all the sugar.  All right.  That hairdo is awful.  Jimmy, do you mind if they stand over here to check out the rest of the game?  Magoo is teetering?  No.  I thought when she bent over to puke, it was going to fall off.  All right.  Why don't they stand back a little bit?  Uh-oh.  All right.  Where are we at?  Magoo is teetering.  He's got to get that shot down.  We're up to the 24th double shot of eggnog. 
[02:00:30]  Sergeant Magoo is making his way to the bucket.  All right.  He has a pitcher in his hand.  He's trying.  He's trying.  The bar's been raised so high now.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  That was all in him?  I couldn't believe it.  I know.  They kept coming like that.  It just...  That was like what?  Like 11?  I think he puked up every shot that he drank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Individually.  Yeah, individually.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Someone's got to count that for us.  I think he puked like 10 to 12 individual times. 
[02:01:00]  They were all gems.  They were all doozies.  Wait till you see the video of that one.  I want that to replace my old puke sound effects.  People are going to be confused.  They're going to go, that guy had to have been one of the last guys standing.  What do we got?  Magoo.  Sog and Magoo, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling a little queasy.  All right.  Well...  How many...  Shot.  Shot.  There we go.  Another one coming out.  What do we have to...  Chit chat.  All right, guys.  This is the 25th double shot of eggnog in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:01:30]  What's the record?  71.  71.  71.  Magoo put that one right down.  Oh, he's puking into the pitcher.  And now you can measure it.  Oh, my God.  He's going to fill it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's getting chunky.  Look at the guy turning his back.  He doesn't want to see it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, my God.  The little spittle threads all the time.  He's filling up the pitcher.  That's almost at a time.  Pitcher's full.  Oh, and the rest of them have to continue drinking.  I think we're done with the puke.  Oh, my God.  Look at all that.  That almost made me puke. 
[02:02:30]  He filled, completely filled up a huge beer pitcher.  I'm not looking.  All right, here's the deal.  We're going to take a quick break.  When we get back, Sergeant Magoo, he's got a pitcher full of puke.  He's got the Froot Loops.  They're opening up the Froot Loops.  He's going to do a little thing for everybody, a little side thing for everybody.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  They have done 25 double shots.  They're up to 26 as we take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This is Rich Voss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today.  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[02:03:00]  WXRK, New York, 92, 3K Rock. 
[02:03:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:04:00]  You've heard them go shopping on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now hear them sing.  K-Smell Records and the Salvation Army present Homeless for the Holidays.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, what fun it is to ride on a goddamn step lady.  Spend Christmas with your favorite homeless lunatics.  You'll hear all the classics.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. 
[02:04:30]  Had a very shiny note just like yours.  Deck the halls.  Spend the season to be cloudy.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la.  And who could forget Siggy's haunting rendition of Silent Night?  Silent Night.  Holy Night.  And if you call within the next 10 seconds, we'll throw in as an added bonus, the making of Homeless for the Holidays featuring never-before-heard homeless outtakes. 
[02:05:00]  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head and shoot all these motherfuckers.  Let me off.  Let me off.  Let me off.  I'm tired as s***.  I said I'm tired as s***.  Off-key, out of time, and smells horrible, it's Homeless for the Holidays.  Get yours today.  Call 1-800-HEP-A-TITUS.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We now return to the Opie and Anthony Eggnog Challenge. 
[02:05:30]  I'm loving it.  The Eggnog Drinking Contest, number three.  Uh, forgot about the bad part of this.  What's the bad part?  The smell.  Dude, I had to put up a paper towel and then, like, spray it with Lysol, and I'm holding it up to my nose.  It's not a crime scene.  It smells like one.  Anthony, do you want to sip out of that pitcher that Magoo filled?  Shut up.  Magoo filled a pitcher, and I'm telling Anthony in the break that, wait, don't drink it yet.  Yeah, don't.  We got to do the big setup for this. 
[02:06:00]  Because if you swallowed some of that, it would be warm like his stomach, but I guarantee you there's a cool spot in there, like, where the stuff that just went down and his stomach didn't even warm.  It would suck it down like an oyster.  Ah!  A cool, like, clot of nog from his stomach would slide down your throat.  I think I'm having more fun.  You look like he's about to puke.  Dude, Joe, by the end of this, we have literally, like, 20, 25 people in this room.  By the end of this, there's going to be a lot of people puking.  I'm having more fun watching Anthony get a little freaked out by this whole thing. 
[02:06:30]  I hate this.  Eric almost threw up.  Eric almost threw up when Sergeant Magoo was filling up the pitcher.  I always puked, too.  Yeah.  Did you?  You know what it was?  It's the visual of filling up something that is supposed to be sanitary.  Let me give the big setup.  We've got a guy getting close to puking here.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  These guys have been drinking double shots of eggnog every single minute.  When you puke, you're out.  We're down to six contestants.  I think we're going to get our...  Oh, double puke. 
[02:07:00]  It's just as good coming back up.  Oh, no.  We just lost two competitors.  The cocky note, Shane.  Oh.  Take that finger down your throat.  There goes Doug Outthug.  Doug Outthug is out of the competition.  Oh, no.  Shane's going.  Shane's going.  False alarm.  Shane's...  Wow, Shane's...  Oh, there goes Shane. 
[02:07:30]  Wow.  You've got to run him smart with that one.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Out of the nose.  Look at Budaki.  He's like John Madden of Puking.  He's just doing the color.  Oh, wow.  And the other guys have to do a shot.  All right.  Hold on.  We lost two, maybe three guys there?  Three.  Growing up...  We just lost three guys.  Three guys right there.  We lost Doug Outthug.  Doug, who else did we lose?  Shane and John.  Shane and John.  What shot was that? 
[02:08:00]  That was the 30-second double shot of Eggnog.  We got three guys left in the competition here.  Shane was a victim of the other two guys puking.  He said that those two guys puking made him puke.  Right.  He was facing the wall.  Yep.  Like at the end of Blair Witch.  And other people were puking.  Wait, there's only three guys left?  Three guys left.  We came back from break with six guys, and right away we lost three of them.  Pat, the big...  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  Oh! 
[02:08:30]  What happened there?  I missed it.  It came out of his nose.  It came out of his nose?  Oh.  Oh.  And Doug's not done yet.  Doug's vomiting more.  And Doug's now vomiting more.  I have to see him.  It paid off this week, didn't it?  Shane was just wiping off his forehead.  That's how much it's sprayed out.  Wow.  He power-booted through his nose there, Joe?  You heard it.  It was like...  Yeah.  It's like a horse that just won the derby. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  No surprise.  We're down to three competitors, and it's the three biggest guys in the competition.  Pat from Minaki.  Who's it?  General Rosso?  General Rosso.  From whackbag.com.  I told him I'd do him proud.  You're in the...  Oh.  More pukey going.  Wow.  Some of the guys that are out of the competition.  Oh, really?  He's coming out of his nose.  Coming out of his nose.  Oh, my God.  Goes out as much his nose as it does his mouth.  And then what do we got over there?  Are you all right?  I'm good.  All good.  I'm all good.  Yeah, the 6'6", 460-pound dude is doing fine, too. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, Jerry doesn't even look nervous.  And so what is it?  Jerry Generoso and Pat from Minaki left in the competition.  Hey, anybody want to make 20 bucks and just take a sip out of Sergeant Magoo's pitcher?  Yeah.  A nice warm sip.  Well, where is Sergeant Magoo?  He promised us a little thing here.  All right, you guys are cool, right?  All right, we're going to let the guys continue with the eggnog drinking contest.  That's 33, 34?  That's 35.  35.  See how fast this goes?  All right, they're up to 35 double shots of eggnog. 
[02:10:00]  Sergeant Magoo, the mic is yours there.  Yes, sir.  So what do you want to do today?  Well, I know what, I'm here to make Joe Rogan puke, maybe.  Joe, what do you think?  It's got to take a lot.  We've got a full picture here of eggnog, which I regurgitated.  Yeah.  So I figure maybe put in a little bowl of Froot Loops and we'll enjoy breakfast together.  I see the nice bowl of Froot Loops there on the table.  It needs just a little milk substance.  Oh, no.  A milky substance in there?  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, God damn it.  No.  Holy Jesus.  No, it's pouring like molasses.  No, Anthony, it's pouring like rice pudding.  It's rice pudding or pancake batter.  Thick pancake batter.  Oh, we might lose E-Rock.  E-Rock is losing it over there.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, did you see that pour?  Turn around, E-Rock.  Get on the mic.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, he's eating Froot Loops out of his own vomit.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, you all right? 
[02:11:00]  I didn't know eggnog could clot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock's out puking.  Oh, an innocent bystander gets hit by a straight dog.  Let's make this perfectly clear.  Yes, E-Rock is not in the eggnog drinking contest.  He's one of our own, and he's just puking because he just saw Sergeant Magoo eating the  Froot Loops with his own.  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:30]  E-Rock looks worse than anybody in the competition.  E-Rock is so pale right now, and his eyes are running with water.  E-Rock, look at how thick that is.  Go ahead, Magoo.  Do that again.  E-Rock, you got to look.  Oh, look, look, look.  Watch, watch, watch.  It's like snot.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  I almost puked.  Did you?  I had to walk away.  I had to walk away.  I almost puked. 
[02:12:00]  For E-Rock.  If I hadn't.  Oh, no.  Oh, we lost Generoso.  Generoso.  We just lost Generoso for whackbags on down.  Sergeant Magoo is taking everybody out of the competition.  Oh, Magoo is carpet bomber.  Magoo's like a suicide bomber.  He really is.  Poor E-Rock.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Oh, look.  They're all stuck together.  It's like oyster crackers.  Magoo, why don't you top off the Froot Loops with a little more of what you got in the 
[02:12:30]  picture there?  How does it take?  No.  Eric is in the garbage chair.  Eric is puking on the storm.  His stupid headphones are still on.  God, that is hilarious.  Take us to break, stupid.  Oh, my God.  That is hilarious.  E-Rock.  Are you all right, E-Rock?  Look, he's going to top off.  E-Rock, watch him pour.  Look, watch him pour it.  Eric, watch him pour it.  Just watch him pour it.  Look.  Look how thick.  Oh, my God. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What children?  E-Rock is puking.  He's all the way in the garbage can.  I almost lost.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Oh, God.  It's like snot.  Sergeant McGoo continues to eat the Froot Loops with his own eggnog puke.  Oh, and there goes E-Rock.  That he poured from a pitcher.  Oh, adding more sugar.  Oh, wow. 
[02:13:30]  A guy like that on Fear Factor could have cleaned up, man.  Wow.  If you have a guy on Fear Factor, you can eat your own puke.  What's going to stop it?  Oh, look at Eric's.  He's got snot.  Oh, Eric's a mess.  He really is, Jimmy.  Poor young hawk.  McGoo, hold it under his face a little bit.  Give him something.  What happened to E-Rock?  I threw up my nose.  You threw up your nose?  Out of his nose.  Out of his nose.  Do you want to eat it?  No.  E-Rock is a mess.  This is the most disgusting eggnog drinking contest we've ever had.  We might not set a record. 
[02:14:00]  We're down only two guys at this point.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Look, there's strings in it.  Oh, there's strings that are connected.  Oh, no.  Oh.  E-Rock, look at it.  Oh.  Every time Sergeant McGoo pours a little more into his Froot Loops, E-Rock loses it.  Where is that stupid Bob Kelly?  Oh, what I'd be hiding.  Jesus.  Oh, Bob Kelly would be puking like crazy.  It's orgasms in Washington.  We invite him, but he does.  All right.  We've got to get somebody else to take one sip out of McGoo's pitcher.  Someone has to do it. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock's got a stomach like Karen Carpenter.  All right.  Let's get back to the competition.  We've got Pat from Menachie.  And what's his name?  Jerry?  I can't really see his name tag.  Jerry, right?  Jerry.  Shut.  We've got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  Of course, Pat from Menachie, who comes into this competition as the favorite.  And very con-record holder at 71 double shots that he did last year.  Jerry, how are you holding out?  I'm doing perfect. 
[02:15:00]  Doing perfect.  Pat, how about you?  I'm in front of them eating.  Oh, I'm just wonderful.  You're wonderful.  Pat, any ill effect at all?  You'll have some of that when you're done.  You're not going to throw Pat.  Yeah, Pat's not fazed.  Sergeant McGoo's trying to eat the Fruit Loop puke mixture right in front of Pat.  Pat has no problem with it.  God, that is so amazing.  By the way, Joe, Pat from Menachie, a diabetic.  He's nine toes.  He has nine toes.  And he's taking in all this sugar today.  He's a diabetic, and he's taking in all that sugar.  He does get rid of it at the end of the contest. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, it'll be gone soon enough.  And let me tell you, hearing him let go of all this eggnog, it's like putting on Sergeant  Peppers for the first time.  It's magic to your ears what you will hear.  It's why I'm here today.  I listened to it for a year.  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Pat puking is the showstopper.  It really is.  I've heard it.  I've heard it on the radio, but I think seeing it.  It's like a Hollywood sound effect. 
[02:16:00]  It's so perfect.  Yeah.  We got guys in there who couldn't get in there.  A lot of guys drove from a long distance and couldn't get in here because it's too much  of a mess.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's going to puke.  No.  Can we get one of those guys in here?  Like, I want to chip in some money and get somebody.  Yeah.  I want somebody.  Hey, we got money.  Don't do it.  Who are you?  He's intern.  This intern will eat Magoo's puke.  How much can we give him?  Oh, my God.  What are we?  What are we?  We're not going to?  We're communists?  All right.  I'm in for 20.  I chip in 100.  Jimmy's got a bid going. 
[02:16:30]  Wait, we got someone else that wants to do it over there.  They're getting more people.  I smell puke if people are walking by.  I do 100, so.  Yeah, it's really disgusting, the smell in here.  Yeah, it's gross.  Jimmy, the competition should be they got to try to keep it down.  If they don't keep it down, we go to the next guy and the money goes up.  Okay.  That's what I say we do.  That's what I say we do.  Maybe I should take back 50, you know, now that I'm thinking of my bravado.  No, thanks.  It's all good.  You know, it's all fun and games.  Jimmy throws down 100.  Everybody comes over.  I know.  All right.  Yes.  Where are we at?  How many double shots of eggnog are we up to? 
[02:17:00]  That'll be 42.  All right, Anthony, they're doing their 42nd double shot of eggnog on their way, hopefully,  to a new record.  Yes, Sarge, I see it.  Believe me.  He's holding up the pitcher like, look, puke.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, Magoo is a good boy.  He is a good boy.  He's a good boy.  He has really added a whole new element to this.  Yeah.  He took out, like, three guys because...  Yeah, that worked for the show.  Yeah, they were looking at it as they're trying to drink the eggnog.  They probably could have gotten a few more shots.  I'm not saying they would have won or not, but Magoo definitely cramped their style. 
[02:17:30]  I'm sorry, not John.  Did Steve see that?  What?  Steve didn't see that.  Steve, you've got to see the viscous puke in the pitcher.  You're a tough guy.  Pour it on the Froot Loops.  Come on, Steve.  You're a tough guy.  And then watch Sergeant Magoo eat it.  Watch this.  Here's our own Steve.  Pour a little on top, Magoo.  Steve, watch.  I can't see it.  Tattoo's definitely a tough man.  Yeah.  When he pours this...  Look how this mess...  It comes out like rice pudding. 
[02:18:00]  He's pouring it onto another bowl of Froot.  Oh, it's all curdled and sour.  Hawk?  It's the hanger.  Oh, the hanger.  Yeah, there's a hanger on the end of it.  I love it.  I would use the word congealed.  Congealed?  And now he takes his little spoon and his Froot Loops.  I spend a lot of time throwing up after that surgery I had, and this is awful.  And now look, like nothing, he mixes it up.  All right.  He has no problem eating this.  Here he goes.  He's got a spoonful.  Check it out.  Here goes Steve. 
[02:18:30]  I don't think E-Rock has any more puke in him at this point.  Oh!  He's dropping it.  He's playful.  Oh, Magoo is playful.  It's falling on his shirt.  Yeah.  He's like a little boy enjoying it.  It doesn't look as nasty as I thought it would, to be honest.  No?  No, it really does.  Hey, by the way, I've gotten word from one of our pals, Wink Wink, that sits to my left  here, that Kenny cannot handle this.  No, he can't.  Where is Kenny?  We need him for security.  Get Kenny in here.  Kenny, why isn't our security guy in here?  Get Kenny in here.  We don't want half these guys in here. 
[02:19:00]  Look, how many of you have.  I want to ask Kenny a question.  All right.  Bill Barr, yes.  Is he in the other room?  Tell him to bring his food in.  He needs to come in here.  I just want to ask him a question.  Yeah.  Yes, Bill.  He actually requested that I stay in here, and he...  Really?  No.  Kenny has to come in here.  Here comes Kenny.  20 years on the force.  The smell is really thick in this room, huh?  Yeah.  Kenny.  Between the...  We need you here.  I saw...  We feel threatened.  All right.  Hey, wait.  Let's get to Kenny.  Kenny's over here.  Come, so to Kenny.  You guys don't realize how bad this room smells compared to the rest of the building.  Oh, really? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  I can't even tell.  I swear.  I'm not smelling anything yet.  It's awful.  I just finished eating my breakfast, too.  Can you just take a look at this, Kenny?  Why don't you watch the show?  Watch Magoo.  This is Sergeant Magoo.  Yeah, get Kenny in, Mike.  Magoo.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That is a pitcher.  That is a pitcher full of vomit.  No, get Kenny over there.  You know who's worse than me?  Roland is complaining in the other room.  Get Roland in here.  Get Roland in here.  He's right here.  He threw him to the dogs.  What a tattletale.  Get Roland.  No, no.  Kenny, where are you going? 
[02:20:00]  You can't leave.  No, Kenny.  Stay in here, Danny.  You don't even have to torture him.  He just immediately told where the platoon was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ratted him out.  Two clicks to the ring.  I don't like it, but Roland doesn't like it.  I don't like it either.  What a snitch.  Roland, you having a tough time?  Get on a mic.  Just find any mic.  Oh, this is going to be priceless.  Yeah, I just had breakfast, too, and I was like, oh.  Really?  Did you see Magoo pour it?  No.  All right.  Watch Magoo.  All right.  Get Roland.  Get Roland.  Explain to Roland what that is. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, get Roland a mic.  He's in front of Sergeant Magoo now.  Magoo's been out of the contest.  A lot of the people puke into the buckets, but Magoo chose to puke into that beer pitcher,  which he is now pouring on Froot Loops.  Watch how it pours.  That was eggnog moments ago.  It is now a bile-y mess.  Oh, he's drinking, uh, Roland's drinking Coke.  Coke trying to, oh.  Oh, look at that hanger.  Now it's like pouring like yogurt.  It's not even rice pudding anymore.  Oh, God.  It's hardening.  It's really starting to congeal.  Oh, and now he will, watch this. 
[02:21:00]  Watch this, Roland.  He mixes up the Froot Loops.  Yeah.  Come on, Roland.  Get a nice eyeful.  Come on, Roland.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's for the competition.  No!  Oh!  All right.  Let me explain.  Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy that we're going to hire as an intern, he's out of  the competition, obviously.  Sergeant Magoo has been eating his own Froot Loops-Pew combination.  Now, Sergeant Magoo gave the concoction to Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy, so 
[02:21:30]  now he's eating Sergeant Magoo's puke on Froot Loops.  Oh, my God.  Eric's about to go again.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock is puking again.  Certainly.  And he has nothing to do with this competition.  We're finding the weak stomachs among us.  Look at Bill Burr, not looking so good.  Bill, you all right?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  What happened, Bill?  Did you see that?  Did you watch that, Bill?  What got you?  The fact that he's eating someone else's puke?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was too much. 
[02:22:00]  Hey, where's Club Soda Kenny?  He's right there.  Kenny's here.  Hey, wait a minute.  Hey, would somebody take...  Now, that picture is so awful.  Would somebody take a sip out of it?  Like, without the Froot Loops, just a sip.  Just a nice, thick, yogurty sip.  Oh!  No.  Eric's down.  E-Rock's down.  E-Rock's down again.  Wait, we've got to explain, because it's just noise for people out there.  The intern took a big, mouthful sip out of Magoo's picture of thick, viscous-y vomit. 
[02:22:30]  He took a Viking swig.  Passed up.  A Viking swig.  And it spilled over his cheeks and chin, ran down his shirt, and splattered on the floor.  That was a victory battle swig.  He just conquered this town and celebrated with Magoo's mouthful.  The government needs to follow that dude around.  Dude, this kid started as a listener, a competitor.  Now he's an intern.  By the end of the show, you're going to be like a co-host of this show.  And E-Rock, of course, puked again when that happened. 
[02:23:00]  You get E-Rock's job, by the way.  He's got someone else's puke from his mouth on his own shoes.  Yeah.  Dude, but did we explain that he just poured the whole pitcher?  He tipped the pitcher into his mouth, and a half it went into his mouth, which he swallowed.  Half it went onto his chin and his beard.  After he ate Magoo's puke with Froot Loops on it.  My dad's listening.  Your dad's listening.  You raised a tough son of a bitch, sir.  Hey, keep it off the rug.  Keep it off the rug.  You should be proud.  You should be proud.  You should be a Marine.  Yeah, it got right on the edge of the tarp. 
[02:23:30]  All right, let's get back to the competition.  It's Pat from Menachie and Jerry.  Where are you going, Hawk?  We only got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  How many shots are we up to?  You have to go back to the days of, like, Attila the Hun to find that kind of disgusting Roman puke rooms.  Just look at E-Rock's face.  Look how he's sad and red, yet pale.  My throat is killing me.  His throat hurts.  It's coming out his nose, and his eyes are all watery and tear. 
[02:24:00]  You look like a basset hound.  You look like Hulk Hogan just walked away from you.  Hey, I got to ask Joe Rogan.  Are you impressed?  Yeah.  I mean, you've seen it all on Fear Factor.  Are you impressed with this or what?  I'm very impressed with the drinking of the puke.  Yeah.  That's unprecedented.  I've never seen anything like that, and I bow down.  I bow down to Pat Duffy.  All right, right on.  Pat Duffy.  Holy mother of Jesus.  Yeah, well.  And he didn't puke after he did it?  No.  Huh?  Can someone else do that for the money?  Well, we got another kid.  You guys want to do the same thing? 
[02:24:30]  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  This guy's saying he can top what he did?  No, he said he can't top that.  Oh, you can't top that.  All right.  How about the guy with the beard, the Nirvana shirt?  We recognize him.  Can you top that?  Do you think you could drink that?  The beard is going to be a nice touch.  The beard?  Yeah.  It drooling.  Do you think you could?  It looks like a fake beard, doesn't it?  Do you think you could top drinking?  Oh, he's stepping in the other guy's puke.  He's in the puke now.  He's stepping in it.  Do you think you could top drinking that puke out of that beer pitcher?  Can I top it? 
[02:25:00]  If you gargle it.  I have no idea.  Can you do it?  Who can gargle?  You know what we should do?  We should fill up two cups and see who could drink an entire cup.  One or the other.  A chugging contest?  Yeah.  You're out?  No, I got it.  I'm in.  Oh, my God.  He's an animal, Joe.  He's an animal.  He's already done it.  You're a rookie.  Okay, we're back to the competition.  We're at the what?  51.  51.  51.  Now, I'm seeing Jerry. 
[02:25:30]  Jerry and Pat from Unaki.  Jerry's taking some deep breaths.  I'm getting a little shaky.  You're getting a little shaky.  Pat from Unaki, how are you holding up?  I'm fine.  Pat is fine.  He's unshakable.  Pat is amazing.  Pat is unshakable.  An amazing athlete, I like to call him.  High-level athlete.  Yes.  Yeah.  Next year, we've got to do this.  Jerry's sweating.  We've got to do this in front of an audience, man.  You're looking a little pale, and I'm seeing like this almost spasmatic, like you're ready to puke.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Sergeant Magoo has poured out the big cups of puke. 
[02:26:00]  Magoo is a good pourer.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I almost gagged.  Sweaty.  You came very close.  It's like there's seaweed in there.  Look at it, Eric.  You won't look up.  It looks like curdled vanilla pudding.  Good call.  Curdled vanilla pudding.  Yeah.  All right.  Here it is.  Two equal cups full of eggnog vomit.  Jerry, don't look at this, brother.  Brother, don't look at this.  I want you in this competition a little longer.  Holy Jesus.  All right.  We got the two guys still in the eggnog drinking contest officially. 
[02:26:30]  We got three rings happening here.  It's like a circus.  We got these two guys on the side.  They're going to drink a cup of eggnog, right?  Mm-hmm.  First one.  Eggnog puke.  Eggnog puke.  What's the deal?  The guy who finished first wins the money?  Yeah.  Jimmy, it's your thing.  I think so, yeah.  I don't care.  Whoever wants it now.  Whoever finishes it first?  Wait, whoever finishes first?  No, no, no.  Because there might be more puke to be drunk.  I mean, we don't want anybody rushing.  Just enjoy it.  So what's the...  Who wins? 
[02:27:00]  Oh.  Who wins?  I don't know.  We need some rules here.  We need some rules.  How about nobody?  Yeah, I don't think...  Whoever turns the show off wins.  I think they ought to have a chug contest.  Whoever can chug it and hold it wins.  If they both do it, they got to do another cup.  Oh, my God.  This is insane.  Huh?  Another eggnog puke challenge.  I say gargle.  I want to hear somebody...  Jerry's rumbling.  Jerry.  I'll gargle it.  What's your name, by the way, Nirvana guy?  Drew. 
[02:27:30]  Drew, what's up?  He looks like he's in a spin doctor.  Yeah.  Someone else's vomit.  That was a long-time listener, first-time trooper.  That was your chance.  That was your chance.  This is really tough.  I've never had this tough a time.  Nope.  Than's unflappable, too.  Nothing bothers Than.  He's just standing there, tenting his pants.  He doesn't care.  I've been fine with everything so far.  So far.  Paul R. Nelson shirt on.  Show off.  Yeah.  He's unflappably psychotic.  So I say someone's got to gargle with that puke.  Why not?  I mean, it'd be cute.  Drew?  Jesus.  He just gargled. 
[02:28:00]  He just gargled Sergeant Magoo's puke.  That got a little too close.  Did they make a mouthwash for that?  Yes, they did.  It's called a bullet.  By the way, HDNet is filming this whole thing.  Okay.  That got a little too close.  That splatter got a little too close.  A little speck got on my chair.  This must be eliminated immediately, or I will leave the program. 
[02:28:30]  Drew?  It tastes like vomit.  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like, Drew?  It tastes like eggnog.  Warm eggnog.  Warm eggnog.  But there's clumps in it.  Dude, there's clumps.  It was warmed up in a man's stomach.  All right, we got the intern with you, Pat, Duffy.  Yep.  Hold on.  Jerry's raising his hand over there.  Jerry?  What's the matter, Jerry?  I thought it was for a second.  What?  I thought it was for a second.  All right.  What shot are we up to?  We're getting close.  Dan, how many shots are we up to?  54.  All right.  The guys that are still in the competition, it's only two. 
[02:29:00]  Pat from Minaki and Jerry.  They're about to do their 54th double shot.  Oh, they're going to do 55 right now.  All right.  Their 55th double shot of eggnog.  I think Larry's doing the rope it up.  Yeah.  We're getting close to the record now.  Pat, how many more do you think you can do?  A few.  Uh-oh.  There goes Jerry.  Just put his down.  Pat's eating less because he's losing weight for his girl.  So Pat's not in quite...  He's not in shape.  Not in this type of shape.  He's becoming in better everyday shape. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Settle down, Pat.  Find yourself a nice girl and settle down.  Yeah, where's your girl there, Pat?  You don't know, do you?  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Everyone, this is the big guy, Jerry.  Here comes the bison.  Shh.  Oh.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  It's like he's sneezing through his mouth.  I just can't get it done. 
[02:30:00]  It doesn't want to come out.  Did he technically puke?  Yep.  Yeah, we got a winner, actually.  Somebody, uh...  What a different sound.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  All right, here it comes now.  Does this mean I won? 
[02:30:30]  Magoo's holding the thing under.  Hold the picture under.  Magoo, you got to catch some of it?  Yep.  Puking under the picture, sir.  Jerry is still over the barrel.  Not much has come out, considering how much he's got in.  There's a lot of effort.  It felt like a golf match.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, he's puking into the other thing of puke.  He's adding to Sergeant Magoo's picture. 
[02:31:00]  This is so heinous.  This is so bad.  You know what's funny?  The picture was so heinous that him puking didn't even faze me.  I don't know.  His puke is different.  Yeah.  There's something about it.  It looks like white cheddar cheese.  Yeah.  It's thicker.  It's a cottage cheesy thing.  Yeah, it's had time to really, like, solidify in his stomach.  Yeah, the water has gone through different pipes and left the solid.  Some body chemicals have been added. 
[02:31:30]  Look at this.  Oh, God.  I like how he's enticing him with it.  Yeah.  The best part about this is Pat isn't even remotely fazed.  No.  How are you feeling, Pat?  Jerry.  I'm feeling pretty damn good.  Jerry?  How are you feeling?  I did it for you, Tonya.  All right, here's the deal.  Jerry is the runner-up in the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat from Menaki gets his title back.  And not only that, he just finished the shot. 
[02:32:00]  He never had to.  Right.  He didn't have to finish it, but he just chugged down.  And he's refilling his cup.  Look at him go.  Hey, Pat, you going to go for the record or no?  Hurry, one.  Did I mention I was diabetic?  Pat, do you have a grand finale in you?  Funny you say grand.  Wow.  Yeah, where's the money coming from? 
[02:32:30]  Do we have to promote anybody or is it just cold, hard cash?  From just the radio station?  You going to take Tonya on a date?  Yeah.  Buy us something nice?  Buy us a master post somewhere.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  Pat, what are you going to do?  You want to go for the record or no?  Sure, what the hell?  All right, Pat's going to go for the record.  All right.  Let's say hi to Pete in the Bronx.  Pete, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  What's going on?  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I thought my window was open and I threw up all over the goddamn car. 
[02:33:00]  You guys are great, man.  All right, thanks.  It's one of those tough shows.  Larry on Long Island.  It really is tough.  Larry.  Hey.  Larry.  What's up?  I'm driving my truck on Sunrise Highway.  And I look to my left and I see this chick and she's listening to the show.  She has to be.  Looks like she's gagging and making all these messed up faces.  I look to my right and I can see this dude in a truck and I know he's listening.  And he's laughing his ass off. 
[02:33:30]  Classic radio.  Unbelievable.  I'm loving it.  It's been unbelievable today.  Let's go to Boston.  Zach, what's up?  Zach.  All right, I love Zach.  Let's go to Brandon in Cleveland.  Brandon.  Oh, that is.  I was fine up until Jimmy started explaining it.  And the Viking swig.  I had the burps and I had to run to the kitchen listening to you guys on direct TV.  Oh.  And I say the money has to go.  I say that.  Would the young intern gargle with the other man's vomit? 
[02:34:00]  And I say you get the money.  Absolutely.  This kid, nothing fazes him.  Nah, he's a tough competitor.  Just be careful you don't throw up on the walkway.  The only way to top this would be if someone put their head over the bucket with an open mouth  and let Pat from Wunaki throw up in their mouth.  Joey!  That's why Joe Rogan is here.  That's the next level, people.  Let's not make this happen next year.  Let's make it happen this year.  What do you say?  Well, Pat's going to...  See that?  That's all those years from all those great pitch meetings.  That's all those experiences.  That's right.  It's a wonderful episode. 
[02:34:30]  Human water fountain.  Well, Pat's going to have to get to another level here.  Pat's going to have to get rid of what he's got in his belly because he's a diabetic.  So how many shots is Pat up to?  60.  60?  If we can get someone to just lean back, put the head over the bucket with an open mouth...  Who's going to lean back?  Can I catch it with this cup and treat it?  No, no, no, no.  Right open mouth.  Well, we have to do a break, right?  Eric can hold you up.  Wow, we've got to take a break?  We want to take a break now.  Pat, do you think you can do that?  Open mouth?  You've got good aim.  Pat, can you hold out for five minutes before you puke?  Sure.  How many minutes do you have to do? 
[02:35:00]  Sure.  Sure.  How many minutes do you have to do?  This is going to be the most disgusting thing ever.  Like he's ever done this before.  Like, oh yeah.  Sure.  Pat, how close are you to puking?  I'm pretty good right now.  You can hold out for a few minutes?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Pat's a pro.  All right, here's the deal.  Pat's going to go for the record.  We're going to take a quick break.  And we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony show.  I guess when we get back, it's the showstopper that Joe came up with.  Pat's going to have to get rid of this.  He won the eggnog drinking contest, and he's going to get rid of it as the new intern dude 
[02:35:30]  is over the bucket, right?  Pat Duffy.  Other Pat.  Pat Duffy.  All right, cool.  We'll do that next.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the annual eggnog challenge on the O.P. and Anthony show.  K-Rock.  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  We now return to the O.P. and Anthony eggnog challenge.  All right.  We're back for the grand finale of the eggnog drinking contest.  If you're just joining in, Pat Fuminaki has won the eggnog drinking contest, 
[02:36:00]  getting his title back.  He's won two out of the three competitions.  He's going for the record, which stands at 71 double shots of eggnog that he set last year.  And what else is going on, Anthony?  We've got the new intern.  Yeah, the new intern.  Pat.  Pat.  What's his last name?  Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Soon to be legend.  And yeah, he is soon to be a legend in this competition because he has volunteered to let Pat 
[02:36:30]  Fumunaki, who has had how many shots?  67.  67 shots.  He is four shots away from tying the eggnog drinking contest record.  Earlier, Sergeant Magoo, as we know, puked into a beer pitcher, poured it into a bowl of  Froot Loops and ate it, which is really disgusting.  And so did, yeah.  Pat.  Pat, our new intern.  He did that. 
[02:37:00]  One step by step.  Ate some of the Froot Loops.  But now he has volunteered with a little bit of prodding to letting...  If he wants a job as an intern on the show, he's going to do this.  Yeah.  To letting Pat Fumunaki unload his vomit into his mouth directly.  Yeah, because Pat has to get rid of this because he's a diabetic.  Yeah, he's a diabetic.  Now, he's going to kneel.  I would say you should get into position shortly where you kneel on the tarpaulin and lean  the head back over the garbage can because you don't want to be balanced. 
[02:37:30]  You don't want to fall back and break your neck.  Do we have a table?  I think...  What about that little stool there?  Good point.  Like in Max Hardcore?  Can he sit on that?  Let's get the stool.  Is that tall enough?  Yeah.  Can he lean his throat's whole back?  Hey, I got to use that.  Is that stool good?  Put the stool against there.  See if he can sit on that and lean his head back like he's at the dentist.  Yeah, because he can't be the back of the head.  He's got...  Yeah.  That could be perfect size.  Okay, that works perfectly.  Like a hair salon.  Yeah.  Yeah, like he's having his hair shampooed.  There you go.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam. 
[02:38:00]  Sam.  Did you shoot from that angle?  Yeah, shoot from another angle because if we don't get a view of this, I'm going to  be pissed.  This is like watching Haley's Comet.  Oh, you missed it.  You know, you're not going to see this again.  Sam, get in position.  Yeah.  HD net, get in position.  Pat from Minaki, how many shots have you done?  Oh, God.  This is actually also like Flashdance.  Yeah.  That scene where he pulls the little handle and the water goes all over him, but it certainly  won't be water.  Yeah, you get one later.  All right.  Wait, where are we at? 
[02:38:30]  Where's Pat at?  Pat 68.  You really think this is...  You're really going to be able to do this one?  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah, I'll do it.  You're going to let a dude throw up in your mouth.  Yeah.  Sam, how's that camera battery?  Good?  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah, we got like a three-camera shoot going on.  By the way, this is called The Baby Bird, right?  Stan came up with the name?  Yeah, Stan came up with the name, The Baby Bird.  The Baby Bird.  Rogan, of course, that sick bastard, came up with the idea.  Yeah.  And he's in position.  For the first time...  Pat's in position. 
[02:39:00]  In radio history, you're about to listen to The Baby Bird.  The Baby Bird.  How about the first time in human history?  Which is...  Now, I think some fraternity did this somewhere.  That's true.  We're making German pornography.  Right.  This is...  No, I think he was right the other way.  He's too high in the air now.  Yeah, I'll be all silly.  It's all right, because some's going to get on the tarp.  We have a tarp.  We have a tarp.  It's fine.  Pat, how many shots are you up to?  69.  69.  Pat is very close to the eggnog drinking contest record.  Okay, I'm feeling it, though. 
[02:39:30]  You're feeling it?  Yeah.  I'm feeling that pressure.  Feeling a little nausea?  All right.  We got the new intern, Pat, in position.  Pat Duffy.  This is going to be incredible.  And Danny.  Could you mic him from the other side?  Without getting Sam's way to...  We got to film it properly.  Yeah.  We got to film it properly.  Sam, you miss this, you die.  Yeah.  This is very important.  Don't go for art.  Go for documentary.  Yeah, exactly.  HD.  You should get over there, too, just in case.  I think I'm close enough.  You're going to be all right? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, this guy...  The cameraman's not into the whole puke thing, but he's filming it for HD.  You know, sometimes you got to...  It's like a war correspondent.  I understand.  You don't want to see it, but you're there, and you have to document what happened.  All right, a lot of things going on.  Pat, what shot you got in your hand now?  This is to tie the record right here, guys.  How are you doing?  He's taking his time.  It's rough, huh, Pat?  He's pulling this one over.  Pat, do it for love.  He's going to tell me when to go.  Oh, Pat's ready.  Shot.  All right. 
[02:40:30]  This ties the eggnog drinking contest record.  Pat has officially tied it.  He is one shot away from setting a brand new record here.  And, like a true champion, he's only in competition with himself.  Yeah, only with himself.  He could have stopped.  He won the competition.  He's feeling the pressure.  You could see it on his face.  He's not as confident as he was at the beginning of this.  No.  He is just going for the record, though.  So he can pace himself.  He doesn't have to worry about losing.  And the loneliness of the champion left there standing alone.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Also, his belly is really bloated. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, it is really pushed out.  Because you've lost weight, and you've got a massive belly today.  You look like a no-filter pole.  Now, I would suggest to Pat over here, the new intern, our new favorite intern, Pat, that don't move.  It's just going to make it worse.  Just close your eyes.  Your instinct is probably going to be to sit up quickly and get out of the way.  But that'll just make it worse.  Just shut your eyes.  Let it happen.  Now, wait, wait.  Where's Pat Fumunaki going to stand? 
[02:41:30]  Because you've got a whole bunch of guys to stand.  Yeah, Pat, what's your position going to be?  Right there.  Give him, like, a little hair rinse.  Do a dry run.  You've got to get his mouth.  No, the mouth, Pat.  Well, the whole head.  The whole head.  But aim for his mouth.  The record.  The record.  Pat has just set a new record.  The record of 72.  72.  Fantastic.  This kid could not be more relaxed.  He's like, look at it.  I know.  His heart rate hasn't even gone up.  Now, Pat, can we have, like, a dry run of what you're going to do?  Let's say you're ready to puke. 
[02:42:00]  What are you going to do?  Brace yourself on the bucket, each hand, on the sides of the bucket.  And then, right in his mouth.  Pat.  In the mouth, Pat.  Don't worry about the bucket.  I mean, we've got the ball.  It's called the baby bird.  It's not gay, Pat.  Pat.  You are the mommy bird coming back to feed the baby bird.  Feed your young.  Your baby's hungry.  Pat, just destroy it.  God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's going to destroy him.  Please say that before you do it.  Pat, just destroy his face, man. 
[02:42:30]  We don't care about the mess.  We'll clean up afterwards.  Oh, no.  Tom's tie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  73.  73.  Unbelievable.  73 double shots of eggnog.  From Pat Fuminaki.  This is the worst thing ever.  Yeah, this is really, really bad.  He's got that look on his face like those guys in the 80s that were about to fight Tyson.  Yeah.  Inevitable loss.  Pat, how are you? 
[02:43:00]  Uh, it's getting real close.  All right.  It's getting real close.  The suspense.  All the cameras out.  We've never had more people in the studio, by the way.  There's got to be about 30 people in here.  At least.  And what he's doing is very DiMaggio-esque.  This is like the 56-game hitting streak.  Yeah.  73 shots.  This will never be broken.  Hey, someone is saying, please send her the PalTalk camera.  We got it.  I got mine done.  All right.  No, no.  Mine's fine.  Uh-oh.  It's PalTalk 2.  All right.  That somebody's in the way of or something like that.  I guess it's the camera guy. 
[02:43:30]  What shot is that?  The left.  74.  Oh, he's going for more.  He's going for 75.  Everyone's got to pretty much keep their position so the cameras and everybody can see.  Yeah, that's fine.  People are calling from all over America.  They've been puking all over the place.  75.  Just about every city in America.  And in Canada, thanks to XM.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 76.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  There it goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The baby bird is going down. 
[02:44:00]  The baby bird is happening.  It's happening.  The baby bird is happening.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No way.  No way.  Oh, my God.  No way did that happen  No way did that just happen
