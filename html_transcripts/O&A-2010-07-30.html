<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious grilling of E-Rock, a show employee, for his tardiness.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Sam, relentlessly berated E-Rock, highlighting the disruption caused to the show's preparation. E-Rock vaguely blamed a late night of work, leading to a heated exchange filled with cursing and insults.  The discussion then shifted to Oscar, the nervous intern who had covered for E-Rock. Oscar's anxieties were a recurring comedic element, amplified by his stammering and rambling descriptions of his morning tasks.  The hosts jokingly promoted him to "executive intern." Oscar revealed details about his life, including a speeding ticket, his retail job with an Italian family, a past band, a documentary on recycling, and his pervasive nervousness.  He surprisingly calmed down after performing a guitar solo on-air. The segment concluded with plans to have Oscar interact with female callers later in the show.

The next segment featured Colin Cain as a guest, alongside discussions spanning numerous topics.  Celebrity gossip dominated, focusing on Lady Gaga (referred to with vulgar language), Snooki, and Lindsay Lohan.  An update on Homeless Mustard, his sobriety, and struggles to launch his music career was given. Anthony recounted his shooting range trip, the ensuing online criticism, and his habit of blocking negative Twitter users. The conversation extensively covered social media, particularly Twitter, its use for promotion, and Anthony's blocking practices.  Several viral videos were discussed, including "Seti Boo So Icy," a rape victim's brother's expletive-laden rant, a politician struggling to name beers, and "Boo Got Shot."  Obama's appearance on *The View* was analyzed, including the infamous Larry Sinclair video.  The show also briefly covered *Jersey Shore* and the Kardashians, using disparaging remarks.  Ian Halperin participated via phone, and Jackie Martling and Homeless Mustard were announced as upcoming guests.  The segment was rife with vulgar language and sexually explicit content.

The show continued with a discussion about the rumored high salaries of the *Jerseylicious* cast, seguing into darkly humorous anecdotes about deaths and injuries at Disney theme parks, fueled by listener calls and speculation. Tony, a caller, detailed his experience on a behind-the-scenes Disney tour, revealing the park's extensive infrastructure.  Further listener calls contributed to the discussion of Disney’s alleged handling of accidents. Jackie "The Joke Man" Martling joined in-studio along with Colin Cain. Jackie shared stories from his career, his anxieties, past drinking habits, and his current lifestyle, including his parties and unique Long Island Sound float.  He recounted its disappearance and recovery. The conversation touched upon Long Island's North and South Shores, a possum in Jackie's house, and a raccoon infestation in a caller's home.  The segment concluded with Jackie's joke segment, including a "Stump the Joke Man" portion, with callers attempting to stump him or answer his jokes. Jim Norton's absence and recent use of an offensive word on Atlanta television was also mentioned.

Jackie Martling's "Stump the Joke Man" segment followed, featuring numerous offensive and sexually explicit jokes from callers targeting various racial and ethnic groups.  A caller's comparison of Jackie's laugh to a sexually assaulted chicken led to a discussion of a purported video.  The conversation also touched upon offensive stereotypes and included mentions of a notorious German pornographic video and a Japanese “Tub Girl” video.  Homeless Mustard then joined the broadcast, recounting his struggles with homelessness, addiction, mental health, and the events leading to his downfall after his father's death. He detailed his time in shelters, encounters with law enforcement, including an accusation of biting a police officer, his recent sobriety, and upcoming performances. He performed "Creep" and an original song, "Crazy."  The hosts also discussed a past "Homeless Shopping Spree" segment.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Mustard's recovery and gigs.

The final segment included Colin Cain promoting his shows and further interaction with Mustard about his sobriety and upcoming performances. A significant portion focused on the awkward “experiment” with Oscar and two female guests, Nicole and Kristen. The hosts attempted to help Oscar interact with the women, offering crude and uncomfortable pick-up lines and advice, highlighting Oscar's extreme nervousness and awkwardness.  Mustard's soulful performance was also mentioned.  The segment concluded with Oscar exchanging numbers with Kristen and receiving a high-five.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  A box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no-good son of a bitch.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  I do what I'm told.  Completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on, it's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What the hell's going on?  Who's Oscar?  Oscar.  Who's this Oscar guy?  Who the fuck is Oscar? 
[00:01:00]  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock just got here like 10 minutes ago, so cut him some slack.  Oh, E-Rock.  So cut him some slack?  Well, you just told the world that he was late again for work.  Oh, are we on the air?  Sam came in and...  So you guys are supposed to stick up for each other and cover for each other.  Yeah.  That's good.  Cut him some slack.  What do you mean E-Rock just showed up 10 minutes ago?  He just got here like 10 minutes ago.  I'm saying go easy.  Turn down the fucking music.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  What is it?  Switch jobs a day?  Well, we were all recovering and stuff, so, you know. 
[00:01:30]  Why did E-Rock just show up?  Probably had a late night or something, you know.  Yeah.  Probably was, I don't know, playing video games.  Maybe he was tired from maybe working out with the trainer.  All right.  No.  Come on.  No?  Don't be facetious.  Well.  Where is he?  He's probably just in the office putting his stuff down.  Oh, that's good.  You are such a prey.  What?  Just selling him out.  I didn't even know we were on the air.  Well, he should.  Everyone else gets here at a nice early hour. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I hear you.  E-Rock, why are you late?  Why is Oscar handling all your in-studio duties?  He's just a fucking intern.  Eyes are a little glassy, too.  Oscar didn't have the templates on the 360s out.  No.  Nothing.  And nobody had checked the studio.  And Ant tried to push a button before the show.  He didn't know what button did what.  I didn't know.  He doesn't need that kind of stress.  How would I know?  He's the creative force.  E-Rock?  Okay.  Well, I don't handle the replays in the morning.  Oh.  I like it. 
[00:02:30]  There it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, the passing of the box.  Who handles the replays?  Usually they're in here before everybody else is.  So the intensity is in here.  Wait, wait, wait.  Did you sit here?  You mean before you are.  They just magically appear.  That's good.  That's great.  I never hook these things up.  So who does?  Who does?  Usually the interns come in.  But who's responsible for the in-studio setup?  I don't want the interns doing that.  It seems like a lot of responsibility.  Let's see if it works.  It's working. 
[00:03:00]  It's working.  Where were you?  I wasn't even going to say that you were late.  This idiot had just told the world that you were late.  I didn't know we were on the air.  Yeah.  Sam had no idea.  He thought he was just telling us off mic.  Yeah.  Let's say cut you some slack, to be fair.  Where were you?  I was running late today.  The way he says it.  I was running late today.  Why were you running late today?  I just was. 
[00:03:30]  How are you supposed to get ahead in this world?  Oh, God.  Any other boss would be like, you know what?  Go home.  Oh, wow.  They would, though.  But in radio, you can do whatever the fuck you want.  Don't ask me these tough questions.  He just woke up.  Oh, fuck.  Why are you running late, Rock?  Walk us through it.  Okay.  I had a bit of a late night last night, and then I only set one of my two alarms. 
[00:04:00]  I had a bit of a what?  I had a bit of a late.  I didn't hear his dry mouth.  What the hell's going on?  Oh, my God.  Something's up here.  Why did you have a late night?  I just did.  Were you drinking?  No.  I don't drink.  I should, but I don't.  Every reason to.  You have dry mouth.  You're stammering.  You usually don't stammer.  So what's going on?  Why the late night? 
[00:04:30]  I had some stuff to do, and I got home late from work here.  Fagueness.  I hate vagueness.  Vague.  I hate it more than anything.  Vague.  Just fucking tell us what happened.  I got home late.  And don't yell at me.  He fucking brought it to our attention.  But I did it in your defense.  Address Sam, because he's very...  I did it in your defense.  That's not...  That's on time.  Address Sam, because he's very concerned that he's here on time and you weren't. 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  I didn't even know.  I mean, I don't get home until like 6 o'clock at night.  So what happened, and stop with the vagueness.  Go ahead.  I got home...  Address Sam, not me.  I got home about like 9, 9.30.  From where?  We left work here, and then we went to dinner, and then...  You were here until 9 at night?  I was here until about 8 last night.  What were you doing until 8 o'clock at night here?  I had some stuff to do.  Get the fuck out of here.  Shut up.  You don't know what I was doing.  Whoa! 
[00:05:30]  What was it?  Yeah, but if you're going to be vague about it, what were you doing until 8 o'clock last night?  You don't have to be here at 8 o'clock at night.  Okay, there was a reason I had to be here until 8 o'clock last night, because I had to  get a bunch of the weekend stuff done, because I have to leave as soon as the show is done  today.  So I had no time to do anything else today.  So I had to do it all yesterday.  Well, you could have done it earlier in the week.  No, I couldn't have.  I had to do it yesterday.  How come?  Because that's when we recorded the stuff.  Can I just ask a serious question? 
[00:06:00]  I'm not even shitting on you.  Yes.  I swear I'm not even shitting on you.  When I used to take care of the weekend stuff, I was never here until 8 o'clock.  Yes.  Dude, I'm just saying, because there was never a time.  Yes, but you also didn't have management going over...  That's true.  ...over and over.  Oh, this part should be in here.  This part should be taken out.  Well, why aren't you teasing for like 9 million times throughout the entire program?  So you have to go back and recut.  I don't like that he's blaming management for his lateness.  That's not cool.  I wasn't blaming management for my lateness.  So you left here at 9. 
[00:06:30]  So you were here about 16 hours yesterday.  It was a long day.  That's crazy.  It was a long day.  But we could have just gotten in the studio and recorded earlier, and we could have done  it throughout the week instead of doing it all in one day.  And who gets us the studio time?  I could get it if you want.  You were out of here early every day that we don't do it.  But Sam, you remember that one time where Eric, he couldn't record for whatever reason,  so me and you had to do the weekend recording?  Yeah, I've done the weekend countdown.  It's no joke.  It seriously did take tens of minutes. 
[00:07:00]  Tens of minutes.  I've done the countdown twice, and I've never been here doing the countdown later than 3 o'clock.  Okay.  And it doesn't sound as good.  So I need to put in whatever, the extra five hours, and it sounds that much better.  That's the difference.  It's the attention to detail that you're not paying attention to here.  I had a different co-host for every break.  I don't pay attention to detail?  Bret Michaels was one of my co-hosts.  All right, so, E-Rock, 9, 9.30, you left here last night, so I guess you figured, well, 
[00:07:30]  I put in a 16-hour day.  I could be late on Friday?  No.  So why late?  I woke up late.  How do you wake up late?  Simple.  You don't hear the first alarm, and the second alarm is usually the one that wakes me up,  and I forgot to set it.  Sam, is that acceptable to you?  Well, I mean, I wouldn't have accepted it from Derek the intern, so I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  He's just a kid.  Didn't even get paid a lot.  Oh, wow.  But why the dry mouth and the stammering today?  I don't know.  Maybe on a show that airs in two countries, right off the top of the bat, hey, you fucked  up.  Come in and talk about it.  I didn't say that.  Sam, just... 
[00:08:30]  Top of the bat.  Sam, I'd throw that in.  Oh, what'd you say?  I'm sorry.  Top of the bat.  Top of the bat.  It's either by by the top or right off the bat.  One or the other.  All right, well, I guess we're ready to broadcast now that E-Rock's here.  Yeah, because you needed me to do all this.  Well, Troy was...  Oh, damn!  Troy was panicking this morning because he didn't know where the stuff in the light was  and E-Rock wasn't around. 
[00:09:00]  That's the only reason we were talking about it.  Yeah, it seems like we need you here before we start broadcasting.  Oh, oh, wait a minute.  And then we don't wait for the rest of the morning.  Troy.  Yeah, the morning that I desperately need him, I'm like, where's Eric?  Nobody knows where he is.  I'm texting him.  I'm calling him.  And he decided to move stuff into let and not tell me.  Yeah, something else is going on.  E-Rock's being way too big.  Oh, no.  So you couldn't find something you needed.  Well, and nobody else knows where it is, and he moved it yesterday.  So I was like, well, when were you going to tell me this? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I forgot to tell Troy.  We made some updates yesterday, and I forgot to tell Troy.  Well, you're spending an extra five hours doing a Worst of Show that's half stuff from years ago.  It's not even all from this week.  Are you annoyed that he's late?  Yes.  Why, Sam?  Because he used to use the excuse that he was here until, like, five or six o'clock.  That was his old excuse. 
[00:10:00]  But I'm here until five or six o'clock every day now, and I've never been late.  And it takes me an hour to get home.  Damn.  Yeah, they got Sam on a weird schedule.  So he leaves here at five every day.  Takes an hour to get home.  Fresh hour.  And then leaves, you know, a mere seven hours later to come back eight hours later.  But I'm the chump who still shows up on time.  You can start showing up late.  Really?  Yes.  No one keeps track of this shit.  Oh, man. 
[00:10:30]  Who keeps track of this shit?  All you gotta do is come in the other door and then sneak around.  Right.  So nobody knows you're gonna come in.  Troy's picked up on Eric straight to the studio trick that he perfected years ago.  Wait, what's that now?  Well, we went over it way back in.  Wait, I want to hear Troy's, though.  I want to hear it from Troy.  Well, he's going to the bathroom.  He's going down this hallway, and he's walking in with his backpack.  Right.  Like, why don't you drop your shit off in your office before you come in?  He's like, well, I'd just like to go back to the studio to make sure everything's okay.  Because if he does that, then everyone knows he's late.  But if he goes right to the studio, then everyone gets confused. 
[00:11:00]  Like, what time did he show off?  Oh, yeah, he's been here for a while.  Yeah, maybe he was in the bathroom.  I don't know.  That don't matter.  I'm serious.  No one pays attention.  Be as late as you want.  He used to do that over at CBS, too.  He would go through the phone screener's room, through my booth, and then into the studio.  I just want to tell the people, that was Travis just chiming in on the E-Rock situation,  because people just love chiming in on the E-Rock situation.  Well, honestly, I don't blame E-Rock. 
[00:11:30]  He makes his own hours.  I mean, I'd make my own hours if no one cares.  The guys that run the channel, they're still sleeping, I'm sure.  I haven't seen them in days this early in the morning.  And when they do show up, they have to, like, point it out.  Look, I'm here.  Oh, wow, thanks for throwing us a bone.  Technically, you're babysitting the channel, and you're not even here half the time.  So, fucking make up your own hours.  Who cares?  Who cares?  But I want to make sure you guys are prepared for a good show.  Who?  Yeah, we had, what's his name there? 
[00:12:00]  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar came running in to save the day.  To put the templates down.  That's good.  When I was interning, yeah, I got to set up a studio for a high-profile fucking show.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, I love that.  It's not my responsibility.  It's the intern.  I was responsible for getting donuts and coffee.  Oscar came in with the templates that we use for the sound effects machines.  Very valuable templates.  Yes.  Moses should be fucking bringing these in every day.  Oh, delivering these.  They should be kept in the Ark of the Covenant.  Of course.  Very valuable to the radio show. 
[00:12:30]  But Oscar has them.  Oscar had them.  Did Oscar bring them home with them?  Oscar had them.  And then Oscar just kind of started laying them out one at a time on top of my machine.  I'm like, no, just hand them to me.  It's okay.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Yeah.  Where the hell did you come from?  Hi.  Good morning.  I was one of the interns.  Oscar is being billed by Danny here as the most nervous person ever. 
[00:13:00]  Why are you nervous, Oscar?  What's up?  I know I'm tense all the time.  All this radio thing is just not going to work out for you.  Wow.  I went to ask Oscar why he shaved his beard.  And he stammered and stuttered, then said, I don't know.  And then I had to remind him that he never had a beard to start with.  Oh, that's this kid?  Yes.  I sent Oscar out.  I was broke and I needed some cash.  So I sent him out to the ATM just to get me a bill really quick. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And I was just joking around.  And I gave him, you know, I trust Oscar.  He's a good boy.  I gave him my pin number.  And as I'm giving him all the info, I just went, and don't look at the receipt.  Just, you know, being not, you know, not real.  And he just totally like spazzed out and like pulled like a, like a, like a, like a David move.  Remember old David, the intern?  Yeah.  He would, he would twitch and stutter.  And that's exactly what I was autistic.  Now, what, what is, where does this come from, sir?  I, um, I don't, I don't know. 
[00:14:00]  Holy shit.  Well, I, I kind of caught the coffee, so I kind of helped a little, so.  You what?  Yeah.  I don't drink coffee anymore.  So I.  This guy.  That's why I talked to Oscar.  You're on top of the heart.  Maybe caffeine, caffeine.  I do drink a lot on the weekends, so I don't know.  Maybe that's just repercussions.  Anyone else hearing, uh, Jim Belushi?  Anyone?  No?  All right.  Oh, wow.  I hear a little Jim Belushi in this guy.  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[00:14:30]  So, Oscar, where did you get the templates from for this morning?  Oh.  And is that your job, or?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  This morning, I had to run solo, because, um, I was, uh.  Just us.  Yeah, it was just me.  And it was one of those things that I was thinking of everything and then totally forgot.  Get on the mic.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm going to close it.  What's all your jobs around here in the morning?  Holy fuck.  I had to do all the jobs.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, setting up the things and, um.  Yeah, just one of those things. 
[00:15:00]  I just.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like, you're the only intern in today?  Well, this morning, a lot of us showed up a little bit later, so yeah, we're.  All right.  So, you had to do everyone's jobs, right?  And what are those jobs?  Setting up.  Oh, all right.  Setting up the waters, the toys, the papers, doing the, uh.  The sports sheets.  Setting up the, uh, replays.  Let me see.  What else?  Oh, the water.  The sofa.  The newspaper.  The water twice.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  Uh. 
[00:15:30]  I love these guys.  The FU line, too.  The, uh.  The what?  The FU lines.  Getting them to, uh, D-Boy.  And, uh.  What else?  Oh, you are nervous little Nelly.  I think I've discovered everything, right?  Oscar.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Why haven't I talked to Oscar before?  I don't know.  Because, you know what?  It just had to happen naturally.  Yeah.  When did you get the gig?  What gig?  Which one?  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry.  No, no.  No, no.  Is this a character? 
[00:16:00]  This guy's for real?  This guy's for real?  No, it's 24-7.  It wasn't king.  You're fucking gold.  Well, I started here June 1st.  June 1st, I started officially here.  That's right.  June 1st.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just.  All right.  All right.  And, uh, you, uh, you, you interviewed with, uh.  Oh, yeah.  I was here.  Yeah.  Sam and, uh, Steve.  Yeah.  And why, why did you want to be an intern for this program?  Oh, I always liked radio when I used to listen back when it was with, uh, 3FM.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, I liked the show back then, and then, you know, given the opportunity, 
[00:16:30]  the Montclair State University was, there was an open house at Series XM, and I was,  oh, let me stop by, and then, uh, my resume kind of, you just kind of trickled down and  end up on, uh, Steve's, uh, table.  Of course.  Because no one else wanted you.  That's how this works.  End of story.  That's how this works.  Of course.  Of course we got Oscar.  Yeah.  Of course.  Do you do radio on your own there?  Oh, no, no, no.  No college radio, nothing?  What do you, what do you want to do in the business?  Well, I, because I'm, uh, broadcasting for TV, um, in production, so maybe I'll just... 
[00:17:00]  Production?  Yeah, production.  Production.  Production.  That's it.  Production, yeah.  End of story.  You're not gonna, you're not gonna get nervous if you're on camera, right?  No, no, no, no.  All right.  So what's your deal, Oscar?  Yeah, no, just, um, yeah, I'm gonna, eventually, yeah, do TV.  But I like, um, post-production, editing.  Yeah.  You're working with Final Cut and Avid, so, yeah, I do, like...  Oh, yeah, Avid, very good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mess around with that.  So you've been doing that at school?  Yeah, absolutely, yes.  What kind of video are you, you're editing?  Oh, well, like, up to now, I've just done, like, mostly, like, small, like, documentaries, 
[00:17:30]  uh, little, like, TV.  Do you make them yourself?  Yeah, yeah, I've worked one with, uh...  Yeah?  You get a camera out there and make your own documentaries?  Yeah, no, I'm saving up for a camera, so, yeah.  What, uh, what kind of documentaries do you make?  Oh, I, I, like, with, mostly with music, I mean, especially because I play in, I used to play  in a band, and...  I see, I see, uh, Oscar there, uh, you're rocking on the guitar.  That's right, yeah, that was last year, we played Bamboozle at the, uh, 2009, and, um,  at the Meadowlands.  I was, uh, it was a great, uh, show.  Yeah.  I think I was, that's, we peaked, and, uh, since then, we haven't, uh, really played 
[00:18:00]  anything.  Yeah, it's just...  That was it, huh?  Yeah, no, we were doing so well, and then we kicked our drummer, and then that just,  that just...  He just kicked him?  Or did he kick him out?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happened.  But, yeah, no, music's fun, too.  I mean, yeah, music, doing the music.  Yeah, yeah, you like playing, so, uh, so editing, uh, you know, what, what are one of these  documentaries you made?  I'd love to see one.  I did, like, uh...  Where are they?  Oh, look. 
[00:18:30]  He gets so scared.  Yeah, I did one for a, it's called the New Jersey Sustainable Program, and it's, uh,  getting all the communities around New Jersey to, uh, implement more recycling and saving  up, uh, on, uh, the electric bills.  You made a documentary about that?  Yeah, yeah, so, yeah, because...  Who'd you talk to?  Oh, I talked to a couple of just, um, let me remember her name.  Uh, it was this girl.  She's from, uh, Rutgers University down in, uh, Brunswick.  And what would she have to do with, like, recycling?  Oh, no, well, because it's just, it, um, it's little things that towns could do, um, 
[00:19:00]  to how to, uh, uh, reduce the carbon footprint, uh, in the, in the towns.  And, you know, recycling is one of them.  Um, they, uh, implementing the, uh, idling law that, uh, doesn't, they don't want people  to stand there and, uh, yeah, then just save gas that way.  I just, it's just...  You are just rambling.  Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.  Fucking Oscar rules. 
[00:19:30]  Oscar.  God damn Oscar.  I got a speeding ticket coming in here last Friday.  What?  Or two weeks later, yeah.  Yeah, what happened there?  No, it was, all right, I was coming to a Lincoln.  Did someone ask you about that?  I'm really confused.  I guess it's Oscar's show now.  Sorry, sorry.  Sorry.  Oscar's picking the topics.  All right, Oscar, let's talk about speeding tickets.  What happened last week?  Oh, I mean, oh, okay.  Oh, I'm doing so.  No, I'm sorry.  At the, um, what happened was, did you guys know that coming into the Lincoln Tunnel, 
[00:20:00]  that little bend that goes into the tunnel, it's a 35 miles per hour.  I did not know that after, like...  The helix?  Oh, yeah, yeah, the little, yeah.  I don't know, is that what this is called?  I don't know.  Yeah, it's called the helix.  Yeah.  So, yeah, so I'm at the top and then I see this, this one police officer, he was kind  of hiding behind this little, um, little wall there and he's looking  at me with this, with, uh, this, um, radio in his mouth and he's looking at me.  So I'm like, oh man, what's going on?  So I started slowing down.  When I got to the toll, there was another police officer waiting for me and he kind  of flashed at me and he told me, hey, let me get your license and registration. 
[00:20:30]  So I gave it to him and pulled over there and then apparently it was 35 miles per hour  and I was doing 58.  Who knows?  Ah, shit.  End of story.  So now it's...  End of story.  So now it's mandatory, uh, court appearance and like $200, uh, yeah.  That much?  Yeah, something like that.  And then like, like, license and all points.  Well, what'd you, what'd you, what'd you tell him?  Did you try to get yourself out of it?  He was asking me where I was going and I said, I'm going into the Series XM building, you  know, I'm entering there.  And then he said, oh, okay.  And then he sent another guy with the ticket already written. 
[00:21:00]  I said, come on, man.  You know, I'm just, I'm working for free, man.  I'm like, you know, I'm sorry.  So the other guy wrote it already.  So I was like, so I just put on like a CD of music and just, I don't know, continue  through.  Yeah.  Rammstein.  Imagine how nervous he was getting that ticket.  Oh my God.  What makes you nervous, Oscar?  I don't know.  I know.  I've always been like this, I guess maybe.  No, no.  It's probably because I had, I don't know, anxiety and then because, and the weekends  I'm cool because I get to have a couple of drinks and, you know, I mellow it out and 
[00:21:30]  stuff.  On the weekends, right?  So maybe it's lack of alcohol in my system.  Yeah.  Yeah, not that I'm an alcoholic or anything.  What brings on the anxiety if you've had this your whole life?  I don't know.  Like what?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The past couple of years, I've just been like busy with school, you know, because I  work full time.  I'm in class.  I wake up, like, I wake up early, you know, I'm always going, and I'm just, why?  And I'm just trying to get things done, you know, homework and go to the library and  doing all this thing.  So I guess it's just like always trying to get things done and trying to not forget things. 
[00:22:00]  Just watching him, it's like, oh.  It's exhausting.  It is.  I mean, Jimmy's not.  I'm on speed.  Jimmy's in Atlanta at the punchline this weekend.  I think Oscar should sit in until fucking Jackie the Joke Man comes in here.  Maybe Oscar can do third mic or.  For a little while, maybe.  Yeah, I think so.  Can you talk about topics, Oscar?  Yeah, we can talk about cars.  I love cars.  Like, you know.  What do you love about cars?  European Ferraris, Lamborghinis.  Yeah.  I love those. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, I just, I'm a huge car guy.  Yeah, you get to drive many of those?  No, no.  Actually, I'm fortunate enough, I had saved up some money a couple years back and I bought  a 67 Camaro.  And that's what I keep, yeah.  How do you save up money for a 67 Camaro?  Well, actually, you don't really have a job.  Yeah.  You sell drugs on the side?  Uh, yeah, yeah, no, I, I, I, I work, no, no, no, trust me, I'm sorry, I missed, I didn't  hear that, I'm sorry.  Holy fuck, man. 
[00:23:00]  So you're a drug dealer and you were able to save enough money for a 67 Camaro.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, it was, it was just a matter of, like, I've been working with the same family, Italian  family for like 10 years now.  You're Italian?  No, no, not, no, I work for the Italian family.  No, I'm, I'm, I'm Colombian.  Oh.  Yeah.  What do you do for the Italian family?  Oh, no, I just, they, they have a little retail store up in Morristown, so I, I, pretty  much do a little delivery, sales associates, and do a bunch of, like, little repairs.  He's a low-level mafia guy, yeah.  Oh, you think so? 
[00:23:30]  Works for an Italian family, he's just Colombian.  Yeah.  Retail, delivering stuff.  Yeah.  They never asked you to kill somebody, right?  No, no.  But if they asked me, I'll do it, I don't care.  Oh, my God, I'm stunned.  So you saved up enough money for the 67 Camaro.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, and then half of it, also, I put it on a credit card.  Half of it?  On a credit card.  How much?  Oh, 12 grand.  12 grand?  Yeah.  And how old are you?  I'm 26 now. 
[00:24:00]  And how much do you owe on that credit card?  10 grand now.  10 grand?  Yeah, but then, yeah, because, and then I took off, I usually take out, like, student  loans for the, yeah, help me out during the year.  Yeah.  Wait, what the, I don't know where I was going with that.  Wow.  He loves cars, he's got the 67 Camaro.  Yeah.  He's a drug dealer, works for an Italian family.  Yeah, mafia.  I mean, Colombian. 
[00:24:30]  Colombian guy.  You get the good Coke?  Oh, no, I, um, I don't, uh, no, no, I don't get the, no, no, I don't, man.  What are you trying to say, Oscar?  No, no, I, um, no.  I'm not into the Coke thing, to be honest with you.  No, huh?  No, I prefer the beer.  Your beer's on the weekends, right?  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Carlsberg and, yeah.  Carlsberg.  Carlsberg, you're going to pick a great beer.  Carlsberg?  Yeah, yeah.  Out of every beer you could choose? 
[00:25:00]  You think it's better?  You like the Carlsberg?  No, I think I've had one or two in my life.  That's what I drink if, like, there's nothing left.  Right.  Oh, wow.  He goes, oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  That's interesting to you, huh?  Wow.  What else with Oscar?  He likes cars.  He likes cars.  What else?  What else do you like?  What do you do?  I know, I'm just, uh, I'm in the process right now of, uh, I guess getting the, um, I want 
[00:25:30]  to, like, buy a little guitar, like, a custom-made guitar.  So, yeah, I've just been, I've been working on it for, like, a week now.  You know, trying to pick, like, the right elements, all the, uh, so, yeah, working on  that.  Can you play?  Oh, yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, guitar, yeah.  I've been playing 12 years now, so.  Oh.  I went to, like, the American Institute of Guitar.  Up, yeah, I was there for a few years.  We got a guitar?  I want to hear Oscar fucking play, man.  Yeah, a little play.  Do you sing at all?  No, no, I'm bad.  I can, I can only do one at a time.  Yeah.  Yeah, and sing.  I sing.  I only do karaoke if, uh, I'm down the shore or something. 
[00:26:00]  And, yeah, and I just get, order a pitcher and just drink and, uh.  Like, Carlsberg and you.  Yeah.  You start karaokeing a little bit.  No, but I can't get Carlsberg, like, at the bar.  I just get, like, you know, the Coors Light or something.  So that's the only thing you really can't get there.  Yeah.  You do realize you just became number one intern, right?  Really?  Fuck Club Buzz.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck all of them.  Damn, guys.  Can we give him executive intern title?  Just like that?  Yeah.  Well, that's up to you.  Without a competition?  That's up to you.  It'll piss off the rest of the guys, but.  Do you like interning here? 
[00:26:30]  Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.  It's a fun experience, you know, every day.  Come in and it's just always something new.  And, um, yeah, I like it.  It's, who is this?  Uh, the Revolving Monk.  It says, Oscar sounds like he has perpetual shell shock.  It's like, it's like, you definitely seem like a guy that's a little on edge.  Yeah.  I just don't know where that comes from.  Normal family?  Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Still with my parents, yeah.  Yeah, mom, dad.  Yeah, mom, dad.  Little sister.  And I have a twin brother, too.  Oh, really?  Is he nervous like you?  No, no, he's the complete opposite.  It's just, I don't know why I'm...  You're rubbing your hands like fucking Carl from Sling Blade.  Why are you rubbing your hands?  I don't know.  It makes you feel better?  No, it's just a little cold, so I'm just kind of like, a little colder in the room.  It's kind of warm in here today, actually, yeah.  Yeah.  I just put it in my pocket and just keep it in there.  And now you're rubbing your thighs.  Now he can't keep his hands out.  You can keep your hands out. 
[00:27:30]  Okay, cool.  Just try not to rub them.  Okay, all right, cool.  All right, your fingers are touching.  Yeah, that really is.  All right.  Yeah.  And don't hold on to the chair, either.  Okay.  Don't touch your jeans.  Yeah, give that a try.  All right.  How bad do you want to rub your hands right now?  Oh, I'm good.  I think I can manage.  Oh, look, here's the guitar.  Oh, that's nice.  Is it old, too?  No, I think I have one.  He has one.  He just carries a pick around.  That's what I don't have anymore.  Oh, well.  I just thought he did.  Oh, it's all right.  Thank you, Jim. 
[00:28:00]  Uh, well, in tune.  This is Oscar.  You know, it's like Louisiana, you got the whole place.  It's a little warmed up.  I mean, I haven't done it.  I just thought it's like that. 
[00:28:30]  guitar solo 
[00:29:00]  It's sort of a  Spanish feel to it.  Why aren't you nervous when you're playing the guitar?  Life is fucked up, man.  Look, he'll start getting  really nervous and start rubbing everything, but you give him  a guitar and he's fine. You should just walk 
[00:29:30]  around all the time with a guitar and you're playing a guitar.  You'd be smooth.  It's like Feliciano, you've got no complaints.  What?  It's like Feliciano, you've got no complaints.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's like Feliciano, you've got no complaints.  I'll play it 80 times, I don't care.  Jose Feliciano, you've got no complaints.  Great guy, great guy.  You know when he covers?  Great guy. Is he a great guy?  Yeah, he's really cool.  I almost went to see him a couple years ago,  but then I don't know why I ended up seeing him.  But yeah, my mom said it was a great show. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah?  Was he playing the celebrity room?  Yeah, the celebrity room.  First time in the celebrity room?  So you missed your opportunity to see him.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I missed it.  Sweetberry Wine!  I saw Gypsy Kings last night.  Wait, wait, wait.  He was doing something.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sweetberry Wine!  Damn!  Yeah, Gypsy Kings a couple years ago.  That was a great show up at the City Musical.  So you see a show every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Muse.  I'm really looking for the Muse.  I like the Muse. 
[00:30:30]  Muse, great band, great band.  Actually, I had the opportunity to meet them in 2007.  Oscar, we didn't ask you.  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Oh, he looks around.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  No, really, tell your story.  I'm sure someone out there will really find it fascinating.  Yeah, absolutely.  So it was my brother.  Yeah, it was fun.  Okay, so it turns out my brother calls me up.  Hey, man, I just won a contest online. 
[00:31:00]  We're going to get to meet Muse.  And we went backstage, met him, got autographs, got a picture.  And it was weird, because we got free tickets, too, like free admissions.  But it would put us all the way up to Pigeons, you know, to Tapia.  It was still a great show.  We got to meet him and just drank and got drunk.  Oh, I don't always do this.  But then, because I hold my cup right there with the beer.  And I always just spill it in front of a girl.  There always seems to be girls in front of us at these shows.  And I always just spill my beer over the girls.  Last March, when we went to Muse. 
[00:31:30]  What happened?  What's going on?  I spilled beers on girls.  Yeah, I elbowed this girl in the face.  It was just...  No, but it was an accident, though, because I just...  Oh, I think you're a nervous wreck.  That's why.  Anyways, cool.  Yeah, you're kind of, you know, you're kind of a big guy.  Kind of husky.  And you elbowed her in the face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just bought the Insanity, so I'm working out.  So I'm working on the Slimming Down.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This stuff is insane.  Oh, it's Insanity. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, what's that about?  I don't even know.  Yeah, it's like P90X, but this was all cardiovascular exercise, so it's like guaranteeing sexy taste  to like drop the...  Is it a videotape?  Yeah, it's a DVD.  It's like 13 DVDs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  13 DVDs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are like the opposite of E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Because I'm just saying E-Rock's very, yeah, okay, yeah, very mellow, and this guy's just  like fucking crazy.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What's that?  Should I say something?  We're just staring at him, and he can't even have to say something.  He has to say something.  Eric's a nice guy.  He's petrified of dead air.  Just keep talking.  Talk about something.  Something else, something else.  Let him shake.  Look at his handshake. 
[00:33:00]  From the before.  Before.  Put your hand out.  Put your hand out.  Oh, shit.  This guy's nervous.  You are totally fucking nervous.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened when you were a kid?  A kid?  Yeah.  Oh, check it out.  This happened.  This past December, I went out with the family down in Columbia, right?  So, we would visit this guy who had a little, like, like a little farm area, right?  So, we would just, I don't know what you're talking about.  I got electrocuted, so, I got electrocuted, so, I guess that, I haven't really been the 
[00:33:30]  same since.  What do you mean you got electrocuted?  Maybe that has something to do with it, though.  I was in the back of a pickup truck, and the guy said, hey, watch out for the wires.  I was in the back of the pickup, I was just, you know, like, kind of like, just kind of  like ducked down, and all of a sudden, I just, I felt like this blow, like, it was  like, just a zap.  And I was like, oh!  And then.  Wait, you were like, what?  Like, oh!  Like that.  And then I hit the floor, so my mom picks me up, and she's like, Oscar, Oscar, wake 
[00:34:00]  up, wake up, and like four or five seconds later, I'm like, come back, and I'm like,  shit, did I touch that cable?  And then, yeah, it was, yeah, and then I, it's just, it's been weird since.  Watch the language.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He's quickly becoming the greatest intern ever.  Oh, my God.  In one lousy half hour.  Hey, can you play a cover?  Oh, man, I haven't played a cover in a while.  Although your playing was awesome, no matter what. 
[00:34:30]  But then the guy is, like, smooth on the guitar.  It's fucked up.  Can't think of a cover, huh?  Yeah, I can't think.  I haven't played a cover in a while.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I haven't played a cover in a while.  What kind of music do you like for us playing?  Like, Pantera, Metallica, and Flames.  Yeah?  Yeah, I mean, I stopped doing coverings a while ago, because I was like, why?  Coverings.  Are there coverings?  Yeah, you did.  Do you know any Metallica?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've got a lot of Metallica fans.  Yeah, I haven't played Metallica in a while.  I'll just start trying to remember.  Oh, man. 
[00:35:00]  Let me think.  I can't think of a...  Um...  That's all I know.  I'm sorry.  His entire arm is shaking the guitar. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, he really...  I don't have a guitar pick, though, so that's kind of like...  You need a guitar pick?  Yeah, sorry.  I'll be more prepared next time, though.  Yeah?  I'll start working on the covers again.  Just for the show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What about the templates?  What templates?  Oh, yeah, those.  Yeah, that's why we had to come in here today, Oscar.  Yeah, just one of those things.  It's just...  Yeah, yeah, just one of those things.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you usually bring them in?  Yeah, sometimes, yeah. 
[00:36:00]  What happened this morning?  This morning?  Oh, it was because I was just...  I was by myself, right?  And then I was just doing the headphones and all the other things, and I just...  One of those things, I just forgot.  I just forgot.  One thing.  One step in the...  One little thing, yeah.  Yeah, one little thing.  Good to know an intern sets up the whole studio every day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And doesn't get checked.  And then it doesn't get checked because Iraq was late.  Remember where this all started?  Oh, yeah, Iraq.  Hi, Iraq.  Have you been late at all since you started?  Only one time, and that was a week ago. 
[00:36:30]  The week when Travis wasn't here, I was like 10 minutes late.  What happened?  Oh, I was just standing with Dustin talking about the weekend outside.  He was smoking a cigarette.  Oh, Dustin's the other intern?  So then we were drinking coffee, right?  And we were just talking, and we just forgot.  Lost track of time.  Lost track of time?  So you were right outside the building, and then you were 10 minutes late?  Yeah, it was just...  Did you get a little talking, too?  No, it wasn't that back.  The thing still got done on time, so I guess it was just...  Oh, okay.  What'd you think when you interviewed this guy? 
[00:37:00]  Did you think like...  I would think gold.  Yeah, I mean...  Was he like this during the interview?  He was kind of like this, but he was also...  He was like the most eager person we've ever interviewed.  Yeah, yeah.  And he had a band, and he made movies.  He actually seemed good.  Very eager.  And then he got here, and he's just a wreck, and it's the most beautiful thing.  He's a wreck.  Because he's a good worker, too.  Yeah, he's an extremely good worker, but he's also got this personality quirk that surfaced after the fact. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, you notice that?  But it's one of those things that Danny mentioned earlier.  It's just not one of those things that you're going to notice that you guys aren't going to notice until it happens organically.  Yeah.  If you try to force it, it won't happen.  Yeah.  But this kid is a shaky leaf.  He really is.  We are a little nervous Nelly.  Can we see your movies anywhere that you've made?  No.  Oh.  I have them at home on DVDs.  What about online?  No, the thing is, I have to do the resolution, downgrade the resolution, because they're so dense. 
[00:38:00]  So that's why I haven't put them online.  They're so dense?  Yeah, because I shot at HD, and then there's a limit on YouTube, so that's why I haven't...  Yeah, I have to...  So you've got to...  Get in online!  Yeah, hold on.  You've got to figure it out.  You've got to compress them a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, compress them a little bit.  What's the movie about?  Well, I did the one documentary in the banner.  The one about the recycling.  The recycling.  The carbon footprint thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, yeah, a little nine-minute segment.  Nine minutes?  Yeah, it's like a nine-minute segment I did for you.  We've got to have Oscar do something for the show today.  Okay. 
[00:38:30]  Like, he's got to come back on.  He gave us a great 45 minutes, but what do you want to do for the show today?  What would you suggest?  Well, I'm going to do breakfast orders for the...  Oscar, we're actually talking about something that the audience can enjoy.  Not just Dan and the rest of us.  I have...  I just got the Spinal Tap DVD, so I want to get some audio pulled from it, and I want  to chop it up, and you make it into a little sound, almost like a theatrical movie review. 
[00:39:00]  Just like a little thing.  So, yeah, I'm going to start working on that.  What?  Oh, just a little segment.  I mean, this is one of the requirements for school.  I have to work on a little, like, piece.  You should do something on the air.  Oh, on the air.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, you were talking about, like, you know, it's your time to shine.  Oh.  So, if there was anything you ever thought of doing on the radio, we'll give you a little  time, and you can do it.  We can play my band if you guys like. 
[00:39:30]  I mean, not like a music thing.  Kind of a, you know.  What interests you, besides cars and music?  Something that maybe the audience would enjoy.  Ooh.  I, uh...  What thing?  What thing?  You don't hear.  I don't know what...  Am I missing something?  What do you do?  What do what?  I don't know. 
[00:40:00]  I don't know what to...  I can't think of anything right now, really.  It's just...  But you gotta realize when you have an opportunity.  You have an opportunity right now.  Uh...  Where you come back in in about a half hour, 45 minutes, and you actually do something.  Uh...  Current events, pop culture, uh, I don't know, trivia.  Maybe you could do, like, a car and driver report on some new cars that are coming out.  That's fine.  I'll do something.  Yeah, that would be kind of cool.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Well, I got a lot of guys that are interested in cars, sure.  I mean, he obviously likes telling stories about his life.  They just come up.  Maybe also story time with Oscar, where he just gives his top five stories. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, I got a story that just came up.  All right.  Oh.  All right.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just...  It's a story.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Well, now that you brought it up, I guess you gotta tell us.  I can't even...  All right.  All right.  So, it was...  This happened...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Okay.  I went out on this date with this...  Oh.  Okay.  Go, go, go, go.  Yeah?  You want to go?  He's not doing anything.  You gotta go. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  I went out on this kind of like blind date with this girl.  And it was...  Blind?  No.  No.  It was...  I went and picked her up.  We went and got some Thai food and...  And, um...  Yeah.  Just hold on.  Cool.  And?  Oh, and?  And, um...  What happened...  So, what happened was that, um...  I went and picked her up.  Thai food?  Yeah.  Thai food.  Thai food.  Yeah.  And we went and it's...  Thai food. 
[00:41:30]  Damn.  Damn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  So, then...  So, then we went and got food and I was wearing sandals.  The whole...  Throughout the whole time, she kept looking at my feet.  The whole thing, oh, you have really nice feet.  That's the whole thing she kept saying.  And then, uh...  Hey, I'm... 
[00:42:00]  I forgot the...  No.  Actually, that's not...  Well, that story's not fun.  No, no fun.  No fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, you gotta give us a story before we go to break.  No, it's...  You don't like that story?  It's nothing.  It's nothing.  Don't worry about it.  Remember the feet?  What feet?  You just said...  So, you're wearing sandals and she thought...  Yeah, we just went home, dropped her off, and I went home, that's all.  So, that's just...  That's it.  That's all it was.  That's all.  End of story.  You gotta give us one good story before we go to break, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  This is Oscar.  Oscar.  Maybe something...  Maybe something involving a girl.  What's that like?  Your love life?  Your female companionship?  What's going on there?  Oh, it's horrible, man.  It's just...  Yeah.  No, I just...  I fell out the whole eHarmony profile thing.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, that shit doesn't work.  Hell no, because...  Yo, check it out.  You fell out your profile, and then you go and you...  Hey, you girls wanna get acquainted or something? 
[00:43:00]  And they ignore.  They ignore.  They just don't care.  Apparently, we're compatible.  And, like, you don't wanna talk to me?  Oh, so you find a girl that's compatible.  Exactly.  And then they don't wanna talk to you.  And they still don't wanna talk to you.  Yeah.  So, I was like, forget about it.  Forget about it.  What's your profile like?  What does it say you do, you like?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, everything.  The school, and they got cars, and the music, and then movies, and all those things.  Yeah, you got a picture up there and everything?  Yeah, yeah.  What picture do you use?  The one from the band there? 
[00:43:30]  No, no.  With your hands flying back, and you're rocking out?  No, no.  It was just one...  I don't know.  I was next to a fridge, and that's all.  I was next to a fridge, and that's all.  Oh, shit, man.  So, e-harmony doesn't work.  Yeah.  So, where else are you looking for girls?  Oh, in school, but it sucks.  How does that work?  Yeah, there's a lot of girls in school, right?  A lot, yeah.  But then, like, most of the time, like, you know, you just have friends and stuff, and 
[00:44:00]  then you're gonna start a, hey, you wanna go out or something?  I'm like, no, I'm busy or something.  Yeah, let's just forget about it.  I was like...  Yeah?  Is it you?  Do you have game?  Do you know how to...  Nah, dude, I have no game.  I'm like the most awkward kid, man, when it comes to talking to girls, man.  Yeah?  Oh, we gotta get a girl in here.  Fold up?  Yeah, yeah.  The best thing is just, I wouldn't, like, if I'm drunk at a bar, man, oh, I guess, you  know, I just let a hang loose, man.  I just go up to, hey, you want me to buy a drink or something?  Hey, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, so I'm good. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, so...  Oh.  Wow, Oscar.  Wow, wow, wow.  I'm fucking exhausted.  We're gonna have Oscar come back in, though.  Maybe to talk to a girl.  We'll figure something out.  Yeah, yeah, we'll figure something out for you.  Okay, cool.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Awesome.  New, by the way, new head intern.  That's right.  Oh, yes.  That's right.  Thank you.  New executive intern.  That's right.  Damn.  Damn.  Executive intern.  Comes with a lot of responsibility. 
[00:45:00]  You up for it?  Yeah, I think I can manage.  I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think we move you up to getting the coffee now.  You can allocate responsibilities to the other interns.  Yeah, now you can go to the other interns if somebody tells you to do something, and  you can go, look, you do this.  And your Love Buzz is boss.  Oh, man.  Damn.  Do you like Love Buzz?  Yeah, he's a great guy, man.  Who's the most useless intern you've met around here so far?  I'm gonna say Derek.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Racist Derek?  Pretty useless?  Well, yeah.  I don't like the guy.  We don't get along, so...  No?  Nah, no.  What happened?  No, the guy's an idiot.  I just don't like him at all, man.  Why don't you like him?  Yeah, he's just trying to be funny and shit.  I'm like, dude, that's not funny.  That's what I tell him, man.  A lot of people have a problem with Derek, yeah.  Yeah, they really do.  If you weren't working here, I was just bitch-lapping really hard.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  You fight much?  No, no, no, no.  No, you don't get into a lot of fights?  No, no, no. 
[00:46:00]  What was the last fight you were in?  I was probably in the fifth grade, maybe.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so we don't fight.  Well, not a fight, but since then, it's just basically...  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, that's right.  That's good.  You're a lover.  Absolutely, yeah.  Except you can't find anyone to love.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  All right, we should go to break.  We're going to bring Oscar back, though, for something.  Oh, yes.  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure something.  I know it's completely hacked, but being that he's so nervous and jittery and he's obviously 
[00:46:30]  single, we should totally have Oscar dating him.  I bet there's chicks out there that would love to date Oscar.  He's probably coming across really sweet and charming and cute over the air.  I would like to hear a girl's point of view on what he's like to go out with.  Yeah, and I just bet him trying to just kick game to three chicks would just be...  It's not a bad idea.  Yeah, get a few girls to call the show.  Yeah.  You want to talk to some girls today, Oscar?  Yeah, absolutely.  Maybe see what they're like.  They'll ask questions about you.  You can ask questions back.  Just get to know each other a little bit.  That type of thing.  Absolutely, yeah.  Kick it.  Hey, can you play us out with anything? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Let me think of...  Plays to commercial anyway?  This is Oscar, our intern, who's a fucking goldmine.  And on the guitar, he does a great job.  Take the guitar away.  He's a fucking mess.  Here's Oscar.  What are you doing with you? 
[00:47:30]  You're jamming.  Cool, right?  Yeah.  He can't talk when he plays.  He's a pretty good man. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Mm friday song.  Oh, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We'll be right back. 
[00:48:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:49:00]  Do you like it?  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969. 
[00:49:30]  And now, and now, the Opie and Anthony Show on the Pirate Mysterious XMXL.  Busy show today.  We will definitely have Oscar back in studio sometime this morning.  He's a rising star here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  If you're just tuning in, make sure you listen to the replay today.  Wow.  Radio gold to start the show today.  Wow.  Colin Cain's coming in.  Yes.  Also, Jackie Martling. 
[00:50:00]  Jackie.  Jackie the Joke Man, who's now just a friend of the show.  I don't know how that happened.  If you know the history of our show.  But, yeah, Jackie's really cool.  He's coming in.  I believe he's playing the Trump Marina down there in Atlantic City.  Ooh.  Nice.  And he'll be in at about 8 o'clock.  Ian Halperin, our old friend.  Oh, no.  On the phone?  On the phone.  It's been a while.  See what he's up to.  Dishing the dirt, as it might be.  What's happening in the world of entertainment that he's touching on? 
[00:50:30]  Why don't we tease that a little bit?  What will Ian be talking about today?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Maybe a little Lindsay Lone.  Yeah, maybe.  A little Lindsay Lone.  He might have a little something on that.  Anything on Lady Gaga?  Maybe a little on the gah.  Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  By the way, she's falling apart.  Remember how Jimmy thought she would?  Well, he still thinks she's very sexy.  Yeah.  The more and more pictures that come out, she's a dog.  She really is a dog. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah?  A very talented one.  But she's taking less and less hot pictures.  It's something just about her long, thin legs, I think, is what is attractive.  She's out of proportion.  What's out of proportion with her?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You can't really figure it out?  Well, her face is a little rough to begin with.  And then you're saying her legs are too thin?  No, no.  I kind of like her long, you know.  Oh, you like the long legs?  The thin legs are nice.  I mean, but... 
[00:51:30]  Snooki or Lady Gaga?  Oh, please.  Lady Gaga in a second.  Over the snook?  The snookster is just a big fucking fire plug.  She's a fire hydrant with giant floppy tits.  I got a question for you.  Think it over.  Okay.  Who would let you put it in their turd cutter first?  In the shitter?  In the shitter.  Lady Gaga or Snooki?  I think Lady Gaga has no qualms about taking one in the shitter.  Over Snooki?  No, Snooki...  No.  Snooki is probably a cock tease. 
[00:52:00]  You think Snooki would make you work for the fucking turd cutter?  Yeah, really work too hard for it, for what she is.  Exactly.  And something tells me Snooki, not as wild as she wants to come off.  Strictly missionary.  Mm-hmm.  The second you try to flip her over, she's probably all pissed off and...  Nah.  No, I think the Lady Gaga is probably completely into ass sex.  I even think ATM.  The Lady Gaga.  The Lady Gaga.  Really? 
[00:52:30]  She had to get where she is somehow.  In the beginning...  Oh, she didn't get there on her talent?  Nah, you know what, talent?  She got there on her ATM skills.  Talent is the highway portion of your career.  There is an on-ramp that you have to kind of get on.  That is the push to get on the highway.  And a lot of girls, especially those like Lady Gaga, have to go through some shenanigans.  I couldn't disagree with you more.  Yeah?  I think she has talent.  Yeah, she does.  I think someone like Keisha.  A lot of people have talent. 
[00:53:00]  Keisha.  Yeah.  You know, TikTok, the TikTok brood.  Keisha, the one with the money sign in her name instead of an S?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She, I think, might have had to do a few extra things to get where she is today.  You think?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shitter?  Lady Gaga.  Shitter?  Keisha Shitter?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why she brushes her teeth with a bottle of Jack.  Jack, right.  And I ain't coming back.  Lady Gaga.  She's got some ATM skills, I would imagine.  Is that Keisha right there, topless?  Yeah, Keisha had to do a few extra things to get noticed, I'm thinking. 
[00:53:30]  Let me see.  What do we got there?  Let's take a look at Keisha without a topperoonie on there.  How big is this going to blow up?  Really?  Get rid of that stupid pink star so we can see her topless.  Oh, and then it's cum.  Is there cum on her chest?  Oh, they're covering up the cum?  She's holding her titties, and there seems to be some load on her chest.  Wow.  But that's from many, many years ago.  She doesn't look that hot anymore.  Keisha kind of looked hot. 
[00:54:00]  She's pretty hot in that picture.  She looks like just some slut from around the way.  Around the way.  Around the way.  I always like that saying.  I always love the girls.  Around the way.  From around the way.  That is some jizz there, Dan, right?  Where's she from?  From around the way.  Around the way.  What does that actually mean?  I don't know.  From another neighborhood?  From the slutty neighborhood?  From the hood.  There were definitely slutty neighborhoods on Long Island.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember a few places. 
[00:54:30]  Massapequa was a pretty slutty neighborhood.  Yeah, South Shore.  Bay Shore.  Bay Shore was a slutty neighborhood.  A lot of hoes monsters from Bay Shore with the big hair.  Oh, yeah.  Big fucking blown up hair dudes.  Where I'm from, Huntington, slutty neighborhood, not so much.  No, stuck up.  Centipore, things like that.  Very stuck up.  Although, South Huntington.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Yeah, I hear you.  Colin Kane is here.  You want him in early.  Yeah, we'll get to Colin in a few minutes here. 
[00:55:00]  Also, Mustard's coming in.  Homeless Mustard.  Remember him?  He was a complete mess.  Who could forget?  Keith the Cop brought him in for the homeless shopping spree.  That never happened, unfortunately.  Yeah.  It should have happened this past year, but one of the many things that have been fucked  up in the past year with the Opie and Anthony show.  By legal.  By legal and other shit.  Legal.  Just getting in the way of our creative juices.  Yes.  Then he came in and he sang that song, Completely Fucked Up, Creep.  Yeah.  That is an internet sensation.  Made it his own. 
[00:55:30]  People are downloading it or watching it from all over the world.  Then we try to make a little something with Mustard.  He came in here and he was fucked up and he fucked it all up because we were going to  put out a little CD for the guy.  Did he fuck it up?  Oh, my God.  Troy Kwan was on the project and it was a complete and utter nightmare.  Engineering.  Well, he decided to turn into a rock star.  He brought other people in and we're like, no, just you, a guitar.  We have a posse.  Sing a few of these fucking songs that are obviously doing really well on YouTube.  We'll put it out somehow and you'll make a few bucks and maybe you can stay off the 
[00:56:00]  street.  That's all.  That's all we were looking for.  Yeah.  And he complicated it and he was drunk and he was hard to work with.  Troy could tell you all the stories.  So we had to say goodbye to Mustard and he went back on the street.  But now he got a hold of us and supposedly he's 90 days sober.  Ah.  And supposedly.  We'll see if we can end that.  Supposedly he's playing his first gig this weekend in the village.  A real gig.  So we wanted to bring him in and get an update on him.  Yeah, sure.  We'll see what Homeless Mustard's up to as well. 
[00:56:30]  That sounds good.  Yeah.  I went to the range yesterday.  I saw the picture you tweeted.  Yes, I took a picture.  I got some video.  I got to throw that together.  Did the video come out good?  Not as good as I would have liked.  It's kind of hard to plant a camera near a target out at a range where people are waiting  to fucking shoot.  You can go hold on a minute and run out there?  Nah, there are just a lot of people on the firing line.  Are you allowed to do that?  No. 
[00:57:00]  You can shut down the range for a couple minutes to get your HD flip set?  But every 20 or so minutes, 25 minutes, he goes, cease fire, cease fire, get all your  weapons up on the firing line, open the breach and stick them in the fucking thing and blah,  blah, blah.  And then when everybody's clear, you kind of get your hand up, make sure everything's  clear.  And then everybody walks out to their targets, checks them, puts up a new target, comes back.  Then when everybody's back, everyone kind of raised their hand again.  And the guy says, uh, you know, continue shooting. 
[00:57:30]  So why couldn't you set up a camera?  Well, I did.  I went out there.  I put Sandy Kane, her dumb fucking hat, her stupid naked cowgirl hat.  That she threatened her lives over.  Yeah.  I put that up on one of the targets.  And then I had the flip cam that I had to lean on like a rock and, and I had to kind  of center.  So I'm kneeling on the fucking sand, trying to look and see if I got it in frame.  And then when I finally did, I looked around and everybody is on the firing line waiting 
[00:58:00]  for you, waiting for me.  And I'm 200 yards away from the firing line with heavy, like five 11 boots on.  And it's all sand.  It's like walking on a beach with combat boots on for 200 yards.  That's so they're all just waiting for me.  So I finally got back there and, um, and the camera wasn't said, right?  No, it was.  I got to turn it on, right?  No, I did turn it on, but it's like it, then it had to run for 20 minutes because I can't  just run out and get the camera.  Uh, so, uh, it needs to be edited down, uh, is all I'm trying to say here. 
[00:58:30]  So you're saying it's going to be a good video.  I got it.  You just got to edit it and get it together.  And then some shots of, uh, shooting.  So over the weekend we'll all, we'll all tweak that video for everybody.  Yeah.  That'll get tweeted.  But in the meantime, I had a still pick that I popped up there of, uh, that is with the  Barrett 50 Cal.  And I, I, I then hit it with the, um, the, uh, SP, uh, 89, which is a nine millimeter.  Look at that with a lot of holes in it.  I thought there would be more damage.  Uh, you know what?  I did too, but apparently, um, it's not enough mass to it now to really blow the thing out. 
[00:59:00]  So is this the final picture or did you, uh, do more damage?  That's the final picture.  That's it.  Huh?  The top is pretty well fucked.  There's a big hole in the top.  I see that desert Eagle.  And then there's a nice one on the side also, but all the other ones are pretty much just  holes that are in it.  Uh, you know, there they are.  And then some guy, I tweet the picture and some guy actually says, uh, who'd you take shooting 
[00:59:30]  lessons from?  Governor Patterson.  And I'm like, okay, before I block you for just being a dick bag, I hit the fucking hat  like a thousand times.  What is, what does he think I was trying?  I was aiming for the hat has holes all over it.  So why would he make I miss?  Yeah.  Why would he make a Patterson joke?  Which obviously is a blind joke.  If you, if you're looking at a million holes in the hat, there was not one hole in the  hat, then, uh, you could say something.  And, uh, I wasn't going for a grouping on the top of the hat. 
[01:00:00]  I wanted to shoot the entire fucking hat, which I did.  You wanted to spray with holes.  So go fuck yourself.  Blocked guy.  Oh, you blocked.  I blocked him.  And then somebody, the other guy chimed in and said, what a faggot.  You had to block the guy.  And I'm like, yeah.  And then that guy gets blocked too.  I am a blocking maniac on the Twitter.  I just don't take any shit.  I block entire groups of people now.  Good.  If you're an asshole, then I look at all the people that follow you and I just block all  those guys.  Block.  I love blocking people. 
[01:00:30]  The second they get lippy with me, it's not a message board shithead.  He's very apologetic.  Oh, is he?  What happened?  Well, he says that he was just kidding.  He's a loyal fan.  He's just busting the balls.  Oh, that guy.  You know what?  That was the dumbest joke.  How is that a joke?  Just kidding.  It's not funny.  It's not a funny joke.  Right.  Should I bring him back?  He's taking it pretty hard.  Is he?  Yeah.  Unblock him.  All right.  Look.  Look, Stevie, Jin, and Jay. 
[01:01:00]  I'll unblock you.  But your joke stunk.  Your joke was shit.  I unblock people all the time.  Do you?  I never unblock.  You should, though.  Stevie's going to be the first one I unblock.  You should pardon some people every once in a while.  I pardon people.  I really do.  I pardon you.  Because sometimes I realize I'm just having a bad day, and all of a sudden I'm like, you  just blocked 80 people.  What's wrong with you?  I've never had a block fest like that.  I've blocked a good 10 people in one session, though. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  I've blocked that.  And then their friends say, you know, man, he's going through cancer.  Oh, God.  All right.  I'll unblock you, man.  I'm sorry.  And if I block somebody and you're their friend, if you don't want to be blocked, don't  come to his defense.  Yeah, that's true.  You will be blocked by, guilt by association.  Blocked by association.  I've had it with people and their stupid comments.  Everyone's a pro also, by the way.  Everyone is the best at everything, especially something you're trying or doing. 
[01:02:00]  Because the second you post something on Twitter, a picture of a hobby or something  you just enjoy doing, like shooting, you'll get the guy that does everything great guy.  You ever have a guy that does everything great guy?  So no matter what you do, he goes, dude, my fucking three-year-old could do that better  than...  Really?  Then let's see your three-year-old do it.  First of all, let's see your three-year-old do it. 
[01:02:30]  And by that, you mean you could do it better.  Right.  And then how about we fucking, you know, have a little challenge?  How about a little challenge?  I think the video will put the whole thing together.  I can't wait to see the video over the weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Speaking of videos, you're right.  My dumb Obama motorcade video, some asshole.  She's definitely not a fan.  What?  No, I mean, I'm just agreeing with you.  You already agreed.  I'm already going, because I know where this is going.  And this is...  Someone, who has a problem with that? 
[01:03:00]  It's just a mundane, holy shit, I got to see Obama's motorcade pass, literally, it would  have to be 15 feet in front of me, right?  Cool.  So this lady just writes, worst reporter ever.  I'm not a reporter.  I'm just a schmuck with an HD flip.  Best cunt ever.  Right.  And then goes, you didn't even know that he's in the second limo.  Which, you know what?  You're right.  I didn't know.  But I got the first and the second limo, because I followed the first limo in my shot, and then 
[01:03:30]  I backed up enough to get the second fucking limo.  So, there, you got both limos.  And then goes, and then you pan the camera, and you didn't even get the rest of the motorcade.  Sorry, Scorsese.  The rest of the motorcade is fucking boring.  I mean, the big get in that video is to get the fucking presidential limos.  And actually, it worked out well, because then when I panned, you see all the dummies  losing their fucking minds, because Obama's passing them.  Here comes the man.  Worst reporter ever.  Reporter?  You want to strangle these fucks. 
[01:04:00]  Greg Hughes, live at the motorcade, back to you in the studio.  Right.  What the fuck?  People just really think a little too much of themselves on that Twitter.  Do you think it would be a different story?  Because I remember reading some message boards, they want to block and ban anonymous comments  and stuff.  Do you think people would still shit talk as much as they shit talk if they were forced  to use their actual names?  I think some people would, because on Twitter, it is sometimes their real name, and they talk 
[01:04:30]  shit, which is fine.  I give them more credit doing that, because at least it's their real name.  I'm not going to not block them, but it's better than having just, you know, post hole  digger 235 giving you shit on a message board.  I explain Twitter this way.  It's my space, and it's like, you know, I don't want to hang out with assholes in my  space.  Yeah, yeah.  There's plenty of places for you guys to go and hate all you are. 
[01:05:00]  It's your time, Opie.  But they don't understand.  It's like, I'm kind of inviting you into what I do, you know, and hopefully you like it.  If not, you know, what can I tell you?  You know?  I don't want to hang out with assholes.  There's plenty of places where assholes could go and be free and spew all their hate and  make believe they're fans, and people will, you know.  You really want people to not be assholes on the internet?  I know.  It's astounding.  But with Twitter and blocking people, you could do that.  You can.  That's the best part, is because, you know, if someone starts giving you shit, it's like, 
[01:05:30]  look, I'll do you a favor.  I'll do you a favor.  Now you don't have to fucking read any of my horse shit.  All right, go find another place.  There.  And you'll get an audience.  You know, I'm not saying you're not, you'll definitely get an audience to hate all you  want somewhere else.  Yeah, go ahead.  Have fun.  But I'm just trying, with my dumb Twitter, I'm just trying to keep it fun.  The tweet.  That's what it's all about.  Fun and just, you know, sometimes you blast your dopey opinion.  out there and people fucking give you shit on that, which is fine.  Like, if I'm going to, if I'm going to post an opinion on something, political or whatever, 
[01:06:00]  even a movie, then, yeah, I could see anybody, because it's subjective, getting in there and  just saying, oh, what a douchebag you are, you know, this, you'll fucking that.  That's fine.  I won't block anybody for that.  Yeah, I agree with you on that.  But something like when I shoot a hat up and have some idiot fucking just criticizing  my marksmanship when it's, I hit every fucking mark.  You took that personally, didn't you?  I did take that personally.  I took that very personally.  Not as personally as Danny took his yesterday, but we don't have to talk about my dick. 
[01:06:30]  Well, it's kind of fun.  I do want to tag that.  I don't need people to agree with my dumb opinions.  That's for sure.  No, of course not.  But you can tell people just being fucking, you know, dirtbag haters.  Yeah.  And really don't like you at all.  You can tell.  It's kind of psychotic to, like, follow someone you don't like.  I think that's really strange.  Yeah, it is.  There's so many people out there I hate, I don't follow one of them.  Not a one.  Just so you could fucking type away with some little fucking douchey remark. 
[01:07:00]  God, fuck you, sir.  God, fuck you, sir.  But anyway, very excited to see the video later tonight, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  It was fun.  And Melinda running over the bush, that video is doing very well for you on YouTube.  Make sure you check that one out.  She ran that bush over.  The more I watch it, the funnier it gets because you really don't know what's happening until  the car completely pulls out of the driveway and you see this giant bush has been residing  in her wheel well.  Yeah, I think a lot of people have said it looks like the car just took a shit. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Looks like it just took a dump in the middle of your driveway.  As she merrily just backs right out, not even noticing that there's a hedge in my driveway.  Great video.  Yeah, that is a good one.  All right.  Hey, bring in Colin Cain.  Colin Cain's helping us out today.  Jackie the Joke Man will be here within 15, 20 minutes.  We've got Homeless Mustard.  We'll get an update on him and maybe another song from him today.  What's up, Colin?  We're talking about the internet.  Yes.  Colin's a big social networker.  I love how I walk in here. 
[01:08:00]  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  I'm in the green room and I hear there's a lot of sluts on Long Island and I just knew  it was going to be a great show.  Yeah, yeah.  Long Island sluts.  Well, there's like slut towns.  Yeah.  Slutty towns.  When you're single, you know where all the slut towns are.  Of course.  You didn't have to work as hard.  I think Wine Danch is the home of the abortion.  Oh, man.  Are you a Long Island guy?  Yeah.  I didn't fucking know that.  What town?  I was born in the city and then I lived in Rockville Center for a couple years.  So you know Wine Danch?  I do. 
[01:08:30]  You know, I had a, this is an old story and people will be like, oh, here we go again.  But you know Straight Path and Wine Danch?  No, what's that?  It's basically where all the gangs and the drug dealing happens, but it's the best shortcut  to BAB, the radio station I used to work at.  Just picture the road to the Baghdad airport at the beginning of the war.  That's Straight Path.  One day coming home from BAB, I was doing kind of late nights, not overnights, but late  nights.  Traffic was stopped because there was a gunfight going on between two rival gangs and people 
[01:09:00]  just got out of their cars like you do when traffic is stopped because some dummy lost  a tire.  We're all just talking to each other and it's so obvious that all hell is breaking loose  like maybe a quarter to a half mile ahead of us.  And then they just waved the traffic through as they were cleaning up the bodies.  Like it's nothing.  For me, though, every time I'm stuck in traffic and like I'm there for 30 minutes and I get  to the accident scene, I don't want to see like a fat cop and a poncho waving me on.  It's like, go get the head from the woods.  I want to see some stuff. 
[01:09:30]  I just waited 30 minutes.  Put it up on a pike.  Completely agree.  I don't know.  I just want to see something sometimes.  Yeah.  Well, if I'm going to have to stop, the thing is people don't know what to stop for.  There's just somebody pulled over on the side of the road and I see brake lights.  My horn, I cannot lean on it hard enough, long enough.  And if someone steps on the brake at anything except a head in the street, I am on the fucking horn.  You're one of those.  Yeah.  Move. 
[01:10:00]  I don't.  Driving out to Calverton yesterday, Danny saw.  Danny just saw my rage.  There was a few times I had, you know, that little handle inside the car, you know, like  where you can hang your, you got to hold on tight sometimes.  Sometimes the hand just went up there a few times.  Oh, shit handle.  I feel bad.  Yeah, the whole, oh, shit handle.  Oh, shit handle.  I feel bad because like I'm trying to squeeze between some cars.  So I might have to creep up on someone's bumper and then look over and see if I got enough  room to slide into the other lane.  And I noticed Danny grabbing that, oh, shit, fucking handle. 
[01:10:30]  You know, I know.  It's not like I'm like, uh-oh, because I'm sure you, I mean, look, you've been driving that  car for a little bit now.  I'm sure you know what you're doing inside of it.  Yeah, I got down.  But still, just the fact that it's not you driving the car, that's always going to be an  issue.  I love when people work the imaginary pedals on their side of the floor.  When someone's like, their feet are going for a brake.  You can hear the stopping.  You can hear them stomping on the floorboard.  They're like holding the fucking dash like it's a steering wheel.  They just want, they want dual control.  My girl hates my driving. 
[01:11:00]  Really?  Abso-fucking-lutely hates it.  Are you erratic?  I don't think so.  Yeah?  I brake a little too late.  Oh, is that it?  She hates that.  You're one of those?  But it's a New York thing.  You don't, see, the problem with driving in New York, especially in Manhattan.  Don't let them in.  You can't leave any space between you and the car in front of you at all, because some asshole  will attempt to get in.  And even if you only gave them like four or five feet, they'll go for it.  So then you take that, those driving skills everywhere else.  In Philly, they don't drive like that.  So she thinks, what the fuck? 
[01:11:30]  We're going to be in an accident.  That's why I hate driving and having people in front of me that are leaving a lot of room.  Now, there could be traffic beyond them, and I know their mindset is, well, there's traffic,  you can't go anywhere, there's traffic there.  But every time a car pulls in front of them, they back off again, because they don't, and  then another car.  Before you know it, you're 20, 30 car lengths behind where you could have been, and now you're  missing lights.  Right.  Now you're missing fucking lights.  I can't deal with that on a daily basis. 
[01:12:00]  Well, let's, we got to move on to a video Colin Cain turned me on to yesterday.  I don't even, I don't even know what to think of this fucking rap guy, and I don't think  Ant's seen it yet.  Ooh.  Yeah, can we get that really fast, Danny?  It's quick.  Pull that up.  I'm intrigued.  I don't, how do we find it?  What's the easiest way?  You can go to my Twitter, if you want, you can probably see the link right there.  Colin Cain.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that, and a little plug for the Twitter.  You like that? 
[01:12:30]  God, how smart.  It's smooth.  That was smooth.  Twitter slash Colin Cain.  Where is it?  Probably the third one or something.  Well, look, it's right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, oh, fuck.  The motherfucking rap sumo, YouTube MySpace.  You know what I'm saying?  Niggas say, Santa don't be getting icy.  You know.  Yeah, dumb shit.  And my little dog joker say, Jesus piece around my neck and that protect me from my haters 
[01:13:00]  who be hazed.  Donkey rope.  Call me anything but broke.  Nuggets.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we still got the stacks on deck.  I mean, you know, that's just how it go.  With my little dog there, wipe it out on fire.  Wipe it out.  He know what I'm talking about, but, you know.  No, I don't.  Dumb shit, man.  High limit over.  Stay the boot around.  Superbowl.  Fresh-ass jeez and weed is old.  Yeah, that's how we rock.  But high limit over.  Dumb shit.  Fuck with me. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck was he saying?  That's why I didn't even want to explain it.  I just wanted to play it for you.  Can you imagine him in a job interview?  He would get the job.  There's too many things to start with.  Oh, the Get Our News story.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that.  Perfect.  Yeah, we got to cue that one up.  That is a...  But basically, what we just saw was an extremely fat black gentleman.  Oh, this guy is fucking giant.  With an old school fade haircut.  Yeah.  No shirt on.  Mr. T Jewelry.  Mr. T Jewelry. 
[01:14:00]  He really does have a Steve Harvey haircut, doesn't he?  Yes, he does.  He kind of looks like a very fat Mike Tyson.  He does.  He looks like Mike Tyson in the face a little bit.  Yeah.  And the video is labeled, Seti Boo So Icy?  I think that's his rap name.  His rap name is Seti Boo Icy?  I think so, yeah.  Because he's got the ice there.  He was showing off the ice and the stacks.  Do you know what under his tits must smell like? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  He has his sister every morning just Swiffer.  He just lifts up his waffle tit and just Swiffer's that.  Swiffer under his tit.  Because he has giant tits.  Those are tits.  Those are tits.  Yeah, yeah.  They're giant.  They lay down on what becomes his belly.  And then he's got a double bunt that's split right at the belly button.  Two pockets of fat that go over his crotch region.  He is extremely obese. 
[01:15:00]  Seti Boo's So Icy.  Doing well on the internet, though.  He's a fucking player.  Look at him.  Oh, he has a bunch of fucking videos, huh?  It's one of those when you first look at it, you don't know how to say it just yet.  You look at it and then you say, oh, there's a couple of things wrong with this.  I don't know where to go.  I mean, obviously, the first is just the size.  Well, the size, the look.  And then you start listening to the sounds that are coming out of him.  I can't even say words.  Well, he's bragging about having ice and stacks.  But if you look in the background, it's one step above trailer homes. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That home is on a stack.  If you look in the back.  Stack of cinder blocks.  Yeah, I think it's a cinder block.  Trailer behind.  It could be a trailer, yeah.  It's great, too, because you don't see too many thugged-out dudes in trailer parks.  No.  So that's kind of funny, too.  No, yo.  If you think about that.  He's bragging about being the main guy in the trailer park.  I want to go around and just meet some of these dudes and just interview them.  That would be just like a show.  I think that would be hysterical.  Just really, you know.  If you lived through it.  Daniel Tosh does something like that.  He shits on a lot of YouTube videos and he does his thing.  But I think that would be a funny show to get the real. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, get the real story of Setty Boo who's so icy.  I don't know what his deal is.  Go around and interview these YouTube people.  Yeah.  Did you see the rape video yet?  Danny, that's the one you were talking about, right?  No, I have not seen the rape video.  Go with the long version where they set it up with the news story.  There's two versions out there.  What is the rape video?  Well, I guess it was actually in the hood, in the projects.  There was an attempted rape.  Oh, right.  And then a family member of the woman that almost was raped had a lot to say to the rapist on the news. 
[01:16:30]  Very concise.  Yeah.  Very articulate.  You know that's not good when they let him talk.  No.  But the news loves it.  You know the news is just going, oh, look, we got gold here.  We got gold.  Is that the short version?  No, this should be the long one.  Okay, good.  With the anchor intro.  Yeah.  Terrifying moments for a woman who woke up to a strange man in bed with her.  The woman screamed.  Her brother rushed in to help. 
[01:17:00]  You want to play it off disc?  Because if you play it off disc, it will.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  Do I have it in front of me?  You should.  Okay, I got it right here.  Yeah, because that will drive fucking people nuts out there.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Terrifying moments for a woman who woke up to a strange man in bed with her.  The woman screamed.  Her brother rushed in to help and tried to fight the offender off.  That break-in happened early this morning in the 500 block of Webster Drive in Huntsville.  WFF 48's Elizabeth Jellell caught up with the victim.  Elizabeth's emotions were running high. 
[01:17:30]  And, Mark, the woman, the victim tells us that a man broke into her house and tried to rape her.  Her brother went in and he tried to help her out, but the man got away, leaving behind, though, evidence of his visit.  Kelly Dodson was asleep with her little girl inside their apartment.  And you want to describe the scene here?  Because this is a very visual thing.  Yes, yes.  This is a typical news reporter setting up the story, and now they've got to talk to the victim.  Yeah, I'm just picturing a scene from District 9. 
[01:18:00]  I see a ghetto type of apartment complex, housing complex.  There's a lot of little chillins walking around.  And this woman, I guess, is the one that had the attempted rape on her, is now going to describe what happened with her head going back and forth on her shoulders like a genie.  Well, she's excited.  Yes, very excited.  Yeah, I mean...  Very angry.  She just got raped.  She's excited. 
[01:18:30]  Did she get raped?  Very...  No, it was an attempt.  An attempt.  Oh, then why are the news bothering them?  Yeah, because...  You know why?  Why?  Because they talked to these people and said, we need to put them on television.  That's my favorite.  Whenever they do the news interviews, there's always someone getting interviewed, and then there's like two thugs in the back.  There's been like a double homicide.  Some lady got shot in the face, and the dudes are in the back like, yo, yo.  Just total disregard about what just happened.  Question them.  Yeah.  I think you got the murderers.  A girl inside their apartment on Webster Drive when... 
[01:19:00]  I was attacked by some idiot from out here in the projects.  Dodson says her attacker used a garbage can to climb onto the unit's ledge, open the upstairs window, and then he got in bed with her.  He tried to rape me.  He tried to pull my clothes off.  Dodson struggled with her attacker, knocking over items in her bedroom.  Antoine Dodson heard his sister scream and ran to help.  Well, obviously, we have a rapist in Lincoln Park.  He's climbing in your windows. 
[01:19:30]  He's snatching your people up, trying to rape them.  So y'all need to hide your kids, hide your wife, and hide your hoods because they're raping everybody out here.  The attacker got loose and went out the upstairs window, but he did leave something behind.  We got your T-shirt.  You didn't let fingerprints and all.  You are so dumb.  You are really dumb.  For real.  A crime scene investigator photographed and dusted for prints on the lid of the garbage can in the window pane and ledge.  Dodson says he's never seen the perp before, but sends this warning to whoever is responsible. 
[01:20:00]  You don't have to come and confess that you did.  We're looking for you.  We're going to find you.  I'm letting you know that so you can run and tell that, homeboy.  The brother, by the way, is so gay.  You think he's a gay gangster?  That's why he could not fucking...  He's the homo thugs.  You know the homo thugs.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a homo thug.  Yeah, yeah.  Homo thug.  That's why he couldn't capture the guy.  Right.  He thwarted the rape by just walking in, but this guy ain't fucking holding on to anybody. 
[01:20:30]  He's got a big red bandana on his giant Sam-like hair and trying to talk thuggish with a Fire  Island accent.  You don't think it's working?  No.  No.  He wasn't really...  When he says, we're looking for you, I don't think the rapist is scared of that guy.  Not him.  That video is huge today.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  God damn.  It's just... 
[01:21:00]  Black people, let's just look at that and go, oh, fuck.  Not again.  We got another fucking leprechaun in a tree video.  You've heard the leprechaun in a tree.  Yeah, that's a great one.  I want to go.  I want to go.  Where to go, Dad?  Where to go, Dad?  It's like, you know, there's like black guys that are going to work, supporting the family,  just looking and going, oh, fuck.  Here we go.  Have you ever heard the Miller guy? 
[01:21:30]  Which one's that?  No.  You've never heard the Miller guy?  I might have.  Tell me a little more about him.  Because the leprechaun is played out.  We've played out a million times.  We might have a couple more plays left of this one.  There's a politician down there.  Where the fuck was it?  Somewhere down south.  Could it be Louisiana, Mississippi?  It was something like Alabama.  Down in Alabama?  You got that whole fucking coast that's covered with oil now.  Anywhere where the coast is covered with oil is where we're talking about.  And this guy taking on a very important issue. 
[01:22:00]  Beer.  Yeah.  The politician was taking on beer and whether the alcohol level could be raised in some of the beer,  or whether it should be, or whether it should be.  Big debate.  But then he needed to kind of talk about beer, and he forgot.  Yeah.  He forgot the names of beers.  But he has a friend that's going to help him out.  But he has a friend that's going to help him out.  He has a wingman right there.  It's going to help him out.  Yeah, here it is, Travis.  Go ahead.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have. 
[01:22:30]  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Miller.  Miller.  Cool.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  Moo, moo, moo, moo.  That's a politician.  I love that guy.  It drank pretty good.  It drank pretty good.  How did he get elected to anything?  Scary.  Budweiser, what's the amount of beers we got? 
[01:23:00]  Moo.  The best part, he gave up after naming Budweiser.  He named one beer.  Yeah, yeah, there's plenty of beers.  They all drink pretty good.  What are they?  Budweiser.  And I'm done.  Mazda Brown.  Old England ain't humming my liquor.  Strohs.  Strohs.  Corona with the lime.  They still sell the strohs.  Mortello Negro.  Carlsberg.  LeBat.  Icehouse. 
[01:23:30]  Doesn't even make that anymore.  I don't think so.  But the guy can only name one beer.  Magic hat.  Magic hat.  Number nine.  That's a micro brew.  Peach's Wicked Ale.  Bucket of Rolling Rocks.  That motherfucker.  Those little eight ounce ones.  Those ponies. 
[01:24:00]  Boy, why are the ponies?  Who didn't love the little ponies when you were growing up?  That was cool to just sit there in the woods and just pop and go.  What about the bars that just gave you a bucket?  Bucket of ponies?  Yeah.  With ice?  Yeah.  In ice, you just order a whole fucking bucket?  Yeah.  Those were pretty good.  Those were just...  They drank pretty good.  Those were...  They went down in seconds.  They did...  Chug them.  Gone.  Next.  Well, speaking of black people, Ant, your favorite black person was on The View yesterday. 
[01:24:30]  My favorite black person would be Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, really?  I don't think he is on The View.  What's your second favorite black person?  All right.  Let me think of that.  Number one was easy to name.  Patrice O'Neal.  Black Earl?  Then I don't...  No.  I'm not a big fan of Black Earl.  I have nothing against him.  You're not a fan?  I'm not a fan.  Why?  I have nothing against him.  He could be one of the most annoying people I've ever had to deal with.  I kind of have to agree with you.  We tried to be friends there for a while. 
[01:25:00]  I know.  You were calling him.  He was calling you.  It was amazing.  And he is just really frustrating.  What's something about a black people, Anthony Lagg?  Oh.  You can't name your number two.  Um...  Miller?  Cool.  You can't name a number two?  Um...  Patrice O'Neal and then who?  Old Spice guy?  Old Spice guy.  Do you even know another black guy?  I don't think I know another black person. 
[01:25:30]  Where you can put him in the second position?  Where I can put him in position number two.  I know Patrice.  So if you have a falling out with Patrice, you don't have a guy that moves up to number one?  No.  I'm not every commercial that's on TV these days where you need the black guy, the Asian  guy, and the white guy sitting watching football in some fantasy fucking house.  It was like when I remember when I went to college, they had those admissions.  And like the beginning of the admissions video, it would be like a black dude feeding a white 
[01:26:00]  dude an apple on a bench.  Just something so ridiculous.  It was horrible.  Some unrealistic fucking Benetton ad.  Showing how everyone's going to get along at this university.  It's fantastic.  Francine.  Francine.  From Connecticut, thank you.  Yes, but...  Or Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts, we don't quite know.  Well, he would admit that.  The jury is still out on that one.  He has a little black in him, but...  Francine...  See, but Francine's for a different reason.  I would have had sex with Francine. 
[01:26:30]  You know.  But now, she's just...  She's funny and all.  All right.  Can we play...  Can we play Boo Got Shot?  Boo Got Shot, Boo Got Shot.  You ever hear Boo Got Shot?  No.  Oh, shit.  This is great.  This is our African-American...  This is our make fun of black people segment.  We should really be saving this stuff for February.  Yes.  Well...  Well, February's a long...  Yeah, we'll do it again.  Let's do one more, and then we'll move on.  I have a feeling there'll be something to make fun of in February.  Yeah.  I'm just putting it out there. 
[01:27:00]  Well, we're just setting up what Obama said on The View.  We're giving you examples before the Obama clip.  So this kind of makes sense today.  For Colin Kaye, and this is Boo Got Shot.  Uh-huh.  She was shaking real bad news.  Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, Boo Got Shot.  Boo Got Shot.  I said, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We just saw it.  My sister had called somebody up here.  She called my cousin, Punkin, just held up.  She called her, and Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  And Chichi, she had left out, and she went and got in her car, and she bailed out. 
[01:27:30]  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again, when I heard the gunshot,  and I seen some boy had run in the building over that way.  He ran in that building, and I seen that car just flew off, and then I seen a long gun,  a big old gun in the car.  End of story.  There you go.  She was an eyewitness to the shooting.  How many names could you name in that clip?  Punkin and Boo.  You got two out of the four.  That was a could in Punkin, right? 
[01:28:00]  What makes me that, too, is black people are always the first ones to make fun of us.  Their names are like Kevin, and like, hello, Kevin.  But it's better than Laquanda LaGuardia.  They always try to say something like that.  You missed Peaches.  Peaches.  And I think there's a Pauline in there.  No way.  I think there's a Pauline.  I think that's all the names.  You got Boo.  Peaches.  Punkin.  I like how the way she said, punkin.  And my cousin, punkin.  Boo got shot.  Boo got shot. 
[01:28:30]  Boo.  Pauline.  Well, anyway, Obama was on the view.  Yes, Obama on the view.  Boy, this was really hyped up that he was going to do this.  This, to me, is just blatant campaigning for trying to get the woman vote, I think.  I think he wants to get the woman vote out there.  He wants to get himself.  Remember when he was campaigning?  A lot of the black voters came out.  Women, young people came out for him.  He's trying to recapture that for the midterm election so the Democrats can hold on to something, to anything. 
[01:29:00]  It's even obvious to me that they're going to lose a lot of fucking positions.  They're going to lose some seats here.  Holy shit.  It's looking a little obvious that people are not happy with the way things are going here.  He made a lot of promises.  He campaigned well.  I don't think he's doing very well as president.  And this is just part of what he does best, which is campaign.  So he's being his charming self there on the view.  Talk with the view girls. 
[01:29:30]  Sitting down.  And I bet they were just lapping ass.  Well, they kept it light.  Although I heard Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who I really dislike, I heard she held her own.  Did she?  I heard she held her own.  Did she ask the tough questions, as I like to say?  Yeah, she talked about the tough questions.  She talked about jobs.  Yeah.  And he had an answer for it.  Blow jobs?  Yeah, blow jobs.  They were talking about blow jobs.  And gurney?  And gurney, right.  Have you heard the gurney thing yet?  I love that guy.  Oh, Jesus.  We got 8,000 things.  Just send me that.  Send me.  We should just entertain him today. 
[01:30:00]  We're doing a show for Colin Cain.  That's it.  You have no idea that the fucking Obama got a blow job from a gay guy in Gurney, Illinois?  And they did cocaine together.  Well, crack.  Crack for Obama.  Crack for Obama.  Because he's a black guy.  You know, so the black guys do the crack.  And then he did powder cocaine.  Powder cocaine.  Because he's a white guy.  For the white guy, compulsive liar, freak, weirdo guy.  Can we play this now?  I know.  People are either going somewhere else or enjoying this. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, whatever.  Sit and enjoy, motherfuckers.  It's Friday.  At least we're live.  Travis.  It's Friday.  At least we're live.  Yeah, you got to give me a couple minutes.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Let's give Travis a couple of minutes.  I don't exactly know right where it is this second.  Why would you?  It's in your backpack, nerd.  I'll just start turning on motherfuckers.  Damn.  Danny picks it right up.  This guy.  No, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[01:31:00]  What I love about this clip, I like to imagine that this guy is completely telling the truth,  but no one will take him seriously.  He's being written off as a lunatic.  Right, right, right.  Go ahead, Danny.  This is his statement for the world.  My name is Larry Sinclair.  I'm making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and  Senator Barack Obama between November 3rd and November 8th of 1999 in the Chicago, Illinois  area.  The mainstream media and Obama himself has done greatly to prevent this story from becoming 
[01:31:30]  public.  During those time periods in 1999, I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago, Illinois.  After having a few drinks, Obama and I left in my limo, began to drink.  Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  I performed oral sex on Senator Obama, who at the time was a state representative for the 
[01:32:00]  state of Illinois.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true.  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use is  limited to his teenage years.  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were a state representative for the people of the state of Illinois.  1999, I performed oral sex on you in the back of my limo, as well as in my hotel room in  Gurney, Illinois, two days later. 
[01:32:30]  Gurney.  If you challenge the authenticity of this allegation, I challenge you to take a polygraph test, as  I will submit to as well.  He's going to do that.  These allegations are true and need to be told to the public.  Let the public decide whether Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest.  Thank you.  I think the public has decided.  Yeah, they decided a long time ago.  They decided this guy's a lunatic.  How many visits by the Secret Service do you think this guy got? 
[01:33:00]  Fucking A.  But like Obi said, imagine if it's completely true.  It's probably true.  And he's just sitting there like, but it's true.  And no one believes him.  He knows it's true.  Yeah, he should have saved a mouthful.  It's like, holy shit, Katie Kirk's not calling me.  This is true.  Go spit on, fucking spit in a DNA test tube, figure it out.  I want to move, you know, past YouTube.  I need to be on, I need to be on Fox or CNN or MSNBC.  As in my hotel room in Gurney, in Gurney, Illinois. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  That's a great one.  All right.  This is what Obama had to say on The View.  On The View.  Why would it be helpful or why don't you say, I'm not a black president, I'm biracial?  Well, you know, when I was young and going through the identity crises that any teenager goes through,  I wrote a whole book about this.  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:34:00]  You are good, I'm not a black president.  I'm okay now.  We are all right.  The, you know, part of what I realized was that if the world saw me as African American,  then that wasn't something that I needed to run away from.  That's something that I could go ahead and embrace.  And the interesting thing about the African American experience in this country is that  we are sort of a mongrel people.  I mean, we're all kind of mixed up. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  And, yeah.  Now, that's actually true for white America as well, but we just know more about it.  So he's calling black people mongrel people.  Mongrel.  Malata.  His conglomerated.  Malata.  Mongrel race of people.  He kept a light on the view.  What?  He kept a light.  How did he do that? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, I see.  See where I went with that?  Do you see where I went?  That was very clever.  You're clever.  I try my best.  You're really clever.  Although he didn't know who Snooki was.  But then they're saying that's a controversy.  Huge controversy.  In the past, he has acknowledged the fact that he does know who Snooki is.  Yeah, they had fun asking fucking Obama about pop culture.  Let's see what he knows.  He knew that, what's her name there, Lindsay Lohan was in jail. 
[01:35:30]  He goes, yeah, I know about that.  And then they asked him.  Know anything about the Lady Gaga?  I don't know if they asked him about the Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  They should have asked him about the Mel Gibson tapes.  Yeah.  That would have been great.  Have you ever been that angry at Michelle?  Where you've just yelled at her like Mel Gibson?  And then when they asked about Snooki, he says, I don't know who she is.  But then the news took that and said, well, a few months ago, he knew exactly who Snooki was.  Snooki.  He referenced her, I guess, at the White House or something. 
[01:36:00]  That fat pig.  That's all you got to say.  Are you attracted to Snooki, Colin Cain?  No.  She's not my type.  She's just a little slam pig.  A little fire plug shaped fucking mess.  A little.  No, man.  What a disaster.  She was a fucking disaster.  Do you watch the Jersey Shore?  No.  I mean, I've seen one or two episodes just because when it came out, everyone was talking about it.  So I checked it out.  But I didn't see too much after that.  You watched all the seasons?  I was all in.  Because at first I'm thinking, what the fuck is this? 
[01:36:30]  But by the end, I missed the last three or four episodes.  I gave up on it.  Easy.  It was an easy thing to give up on.  But the new season started last night.  We have audio.  I don't know.  You want to go through the audio of the fucking Jersey Shore, eh?  Well, it was the first episode, right?  You got Snooki introducing us to her new boyfriend and talks about tanning.  Let's hear some of this.  Go for it.  Drivily bullshit.  This gets really mad.  I hate reality shows anyway.  I'm with them, too.  Because we don't know why these people are famous. 
[01:37:00]  I don't know why the Kardashians are famous.  I don't know why the Jersey Shore people are famous.  I don't know why they're more famous than us, I guess is what I'm trying to say.  We've been at this for fucking a million years.  They come on the scene less than a year ago, and they're international fucking stars.  Yeah, well, Kardashian, it's the looks.  I mean, you know, they're sexy.  So they're just famous because they're really hot.  They're pretty, and there's a family, and they're all good looking.  And there's a celebrity angle to the parents and stuff like that.  Yeah, they were in Hollywood.  Who's your favorite Kardashian, looks-wise? 
[01:37:30]  I guess Kim.  Nah, I think the older sister.  Kourtney?  She's got that kind of alien head.  One of them's got a little alien head.  Really?  Kind of.  Who has the alien head?  She's got a big forehead.  It looks like a...  Oh, I don't know.  It's Khloe.  Khloe?  Is it Khloe?  Well, Khloe looks like she might have had a different father, but they don't want to  really fucking acknowledge that, because she's an Amazon woman, a lot taller and a lot bigger.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  And then the other girls are kind of petite, with nice big boobs and stuff.  And Khloe has tiny little boobs, and she's an Amazon woman.  And they don't want to...  What?  The mom doesn't want to acknowledge that she might have, you know, got pregnant by somebody  else?  It's the show, too.  The way that the show came on and the way that they...  What they talk about.  People just...  They clamp onto that.  You know, all these girls, they like that family, and they just get a lot of...  There's the Snooki in the bathing suit.  Look at that fucking disaster.  Because she's coming off like she's sexy. 
[01:38:30]  And guys are even talking about it, like, oh, well, we got Snooki coming in.  Look out.  She's quite the wild one.  She's a pig.  Look at that bunt.  Nothing wrong with a little extra weight.  And I got to back up before we move on from Obama and The View.  Thank you to Sarah from Buffalo, a regular to the show.  Joy Behar asked him if he thought Mel Gibson needed anger management.  Oh, really?  Asked Obama.  And this is such a bullshit answer.  He said he hasn't seen a Mel Gibson movie in years. 
[01:39:00]  Come on.  Yeah.  And so he's not aware of that one.  He's not aware of the Mel Gibson tapes.  Why do politicians...  That's such bullshit.  ...have to lie about not knowing about certain things?  You just want to keep your distance from a sensitive topic.  Is it like you don't want people to think that you're spending time when maybe you  should be checking out the oil spill or the war?  They think you shouldn't spend time knowing about things that are going on?  I want my president to be aware of the Mel Gibson tapes because the rest of the nation 
[01:39:30]  is.  Something tells me if you don't know about certain things, even if it's just some stupid  entertainment thing, that means you're out of touch a little bit.  But he's well aware.  But he's lying.  Yeah.  He's well aware.  That's what bothers me even more.  Of course he is.  He's lying because he doesn't want to get into it.  Yeah.  Sam.  Yeah?  How was Jersey Shore Season 2, Episode 1?  It was great.  The kids are back.  Shut up.  What?  The kids are back.  Yeah, the gang is back in town. 
[01:40:00]  Aren't they all pushing 30?  The kids.  They are.  Yeah, they are.  They're not even kids.  No, they're all in their late, late, late 20s.  Late, late 30s?  Yeah, late, late 20s.  Late.  They're asking for a good amount of money now, Season 2.  I think each cast member is asking for a good chunk of change, each cast member.  Which means Season 2 was really good.  Or they would have said, go fuck yourselves.  They deserve it.  You watch Jerseylicious?  No, I'm still, I don't know.  You haven't watched Jerseylicious?  No, why would I?  What is Jerseylicious? 
[01:40:30]  It's on E.  It's the Jersey Shore ripoff show.  Is it?  Got some Jersey girls working in a salon.  How did Jersey get fucking, like, famous?  Jersey was just known for smelling when you drove down the fucking turnpike.  And for getting beat up by ethnics that would cut you at Great Adventure.  Really?  That would happen?  Well, no, never.  I was never online at Great Adventure to get on a ride and cut by a fucking gang of Somalians.  Oh, I thought you meant pirates. 
[01:41:00]  No, no, no.  Razor-bring.  They cut in line.  But then if you argue, yes, you will get cut cut.  You will get cut as they're cutting you.  Yes, it's the cut and then the cut.  Right, I got you.  Yeah.  Here they come.  Somali pirates.  Oh, boy.  I'll never get on this roller coaster.  I haven't been to a park in a long fucking time.  Don't bother.  Do you go on?  Do you go on, Anthony?  No, I don't even go.  All I go to is Disney.  It's the happiest place on earth.  And they don't allow shenanigans.  Until someone dies.  And then they fucking have to hose it down. 
[01:41:30]  Hose down the blood.  Open the ride back up an hour later.  Yeah.  Never happened here.  It's the happiest place on earth.  Right where someone dropped dead, there's fucking Mickey, you know, dancing around, signing  little autograph books for kids.  There's a fucking chalk outline getting all smudged from Mickey's big shoes.  You think the police are dressed as like Daffy Duck?  No, they're just like Keystone Cops.  Oh, Keystone Cops.  And they're twirling their batons and walking funny like Charlie Chaplin.  But actually they're investigating the latest fucking death at Disney. 
[01:42:00]  They bend over, they put one hand on their hip and bend over and look at the dead guy  and shake their finger at him.  Why you?  Yes.  I heard this story.  Oh, it's the happiest place on earth.  I heard this story.  Keep the music going for this story.  It's very poignant.  This girl got lost at Disney and the mom went to security and goes, you know, I lost my daughter.  And they're like, what color shoes is she wearing?  Because there's so many kids. 
[01:42:30]  She's like, oh, she's got a red shirt.  So basically they looked on cameras that are on the ground, low to the ground.  And all they saw was a dude with a big jacket, overcoat, and then just two legs dangling in between his legs.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, he was bear hugging this girl ready to run out the gate at Disney.  Holy shit.  Yeah, creepy, right?  Wow.  And they were able to stop him.  Yep.  I think she was wearing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sneakers.  They have like fucking foot cam?  Yep.  Dude, they have everything.  That's amazing.  They have everything.  I've always wanted to take that behind-the-scenes tour. 
[01:43:00]  Did you take that, Travis, ever?  No, I want to, though.  Yeah, it takes like hours to do.  It's like a whole fucking day you spend in the bowels of Disney to see how the rides work.  Because, like, it shows you the engineering behind it, and it's an entire fucking city underneath that park.  Did you get to check out the morgue?  Where they keep the dead people that have died at Disney, and they don't want anyone to know.  Yeah.  Like that Asian guy that was standing too close to the Columbia, which is this little sailing ship that goes around Tom Sawyer Island at Disneyland. 
[01:43:30]  And they went to hook the rope on the cleat, and the boat was going a little too fast.  It grabbed the cleat, and the rope fucking stood, and bam, the cleat came out and whipped him square in the head.  And just knocked his head off, half his fucking head off.  And you know what they did?  Hose it down.  Keep the Columbia rolling.  Rides close for an hour.  That's it.  Wow.  Yeah.  There's like, there's Mickey at the front of the line on that sign with, we've had a death. 
[01:44:00]  You know, ride close due to death.  Check back in an hour.  Or, you know, this is an urban legend.  Get your fast pass.  As soon as they see a black family going to Disney, they raise the fucking admission fee.  Do they?  Mm-hmm.  So that doesn't happen again.  So it doesn't happen again?  Yeah.  Obi, why don't you go on the rides?  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba!  Why don't you go on the rides?  I got a weak stomach there, Con.  That's bringing it up.  No, no, me too.  I'm not, I don't.  No, I go on rides.  I'm not rollercoaster guy.  I actually do go on rides.  I'm not rollercoaster guy at all.  I don't need to be terrified that badly. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  I agree.  I went to Busch Gardens.  I was in Florida working a couple months ago, and I said to myself, you know what?  I'm just going to face my fear and get on this rollercoaster.  I haven't been on like 20 years.  And I went on.  I just said, I'm just going to do it the whole way up.  I'm just little kids and families inside.  I'm just dying.  You're just fucking anxious and nervous?  I was with this girl, and I hopped on there.  And then all you see is the picture they take when they come down.  You see everybody's hands in the air, and I'm just huddled down.  It was the worst feeling.  I just can't even look.  No.  Those flies.  I just always think I'm dying. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Like, I can't.  When do you ever feel that feeling besides that?  No, never.  It's just like, if I get on a rollercoaster like that, I'm like, oh my God, I'm going  to be the one that just drops dead on this ride, and they're going to have to take me  off, and it's just going to be awful.  We have a guy that went behind the scenes.  Oh, yeah?  Tony on Long Island.  Tony.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  You say Disney behind the scenes.  It's creepy.  Why is it creepy?  You start to realize the Florida Disney Park, Walt Disney World, was the second revision, 
[01:45:30]  and some of the stuff that they did is kind of, you know, bone-chilling.  Like, if you go down Main Street, they always tell you, if you want to get an advantage in  the park, walk to the left, because, you know, God knows who figured out that, you know,  if you leave humans to themselves, left or right, they're going to go to the right,  so all the parts to the right are, all the curbs to the right are wider, so more people  can go through them, and you just start to see these really weird kind of, these really 
[01:46:00]  weird trends that happen.  Like, I took a Disney cruise a couple years back, and, you know, if you've ever done a  cruise, they always try to hit you up with doing photos, and you are getting out.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Texas.  Aaron.  Ha, ha, ha.  I knew it.  Aaron, how are you, sir?  I like how I was rambling.  Good, good.  Uh, back in 96, 97, me and my girlfriend, and I was my wife at the time, and her family,  we all went to Orlando, and, um, while we were at Universal Studios, we heard that a guy 
[01:46:30]  was working on the High Line, and, uh, he basically fell to his death.  Well, a couple days later, we went to Disney World, and we found where he fell, and it was  a part of a fountain, and apparently they painted it, but didn't put paint.  They just had everything roped off, saying wet paint.  Wet paint?  They already were painting over it.  Because the guy was fucking splattered.  You know, uh, Steve in Massachusetts, I've heard this one before.  Yes.  We've talked about this on the show before.  Go ahead, Steve.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, uh, my sister works at Disney. 
[01:47:00]  She's been working in the park for the last, like, seven years.  Nobody has ever been declared dead in the park.  They won't allow them to actually die.  They will, if someone's, like, in the middle of dying, and they're, like, five minutes away,  they'll, like, stop them out of the park, like, they're a fucking drunk person in, like,  a gangster movie at a club.  Dude, I think that...  Is that an urban legend?  I think it's an urban legend.  I've heard they try to drag you off the property so you could die.  And that, yeah, but, I mean...  Off property grounds. 
[01:47:30]  There was a kid that died in that Mission Mars thing, and, uh, he died at Disney.  There's no fucking, you know...  Yeah, I heard they throw them in the ambulance, and whether they're dead or not, they don't  declare them dead until they get to the hospital, but, uh, I don't, uh, I think that's, um, urban  myth.  All right, why don't we, uh, move, uh, onto the Jersey Shore thing.  So, Sam, it was a good first episode, season two?  Uh, let's say, for fear of bad publicity, Disney has a resort listed as a place of death on  the death certificate to prevent this from having, Disney has a two-tier process for 
[01:48:00]  handling serious...  Now, is this true?  We don't know.  First, a quick response team, always ready, out of public view, rushes to the scene and  spares no expense to either stabilize the injured individual or get him or her through  an ambulance, ASAP.  If there is no hope or the team arrives too late, the problem is dropped into the park's  underground pneumatic system and quickly, unceremoniously ejected onto Harvard Boulevard. 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  That's fucked up.  That's fake.  It has to be.  A pneumatic system.  The ground floor of Disney is all underground.  Yeah, yeah.  So that's not necessarily false.  They would just...  Like, they probably do take him to, like, the ground floor or whatever, but I've never  read an article that says he was pronounced dead at Disney.  Uh, I think the little kid was, that died on that Mission to Mars thing. 
[01:49:00]  I don't know.  It spun his fucking little heart stop.  His little heart just stopped.  They spun him too quickly.  Here's Scott in Jersey.  We want to get a little feel for the behind-the-scenes tour.  Maybe Scott will help us out.  Scott?  The other guy didn't.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, uh, underneath Disney is a complete city.  It's, it's, they have roadways and everything for all their vehicles and security to just  travel back and forth with cars and trucks and everything under there. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  I want to see that.  Yeah, I know.  Why don't they show it?  I don't think that's possible.  Did you, did you go down there?  I did not.  How do you know about this?  So this is hearsay.  Very, very good family member of mine, uh...  He's goofy.  ...down in Florida in law enforcement and has been down there.  No, it's all true.  There's videos of it online.  Oh.  Yeah.  Of the underground city?  Yeah, there's Disney official videos of...  Yeah, because Walt Disney didn't want kids seeing, like, you know, Mickey Mouse walking 
[01:50:00]  somewhere or, like, some guy that works in Tomorrowland in Frontierland, you know?  So the entire underneath of Disney all branches out to all different parts of the park.  Ooh.  So all the cast members, the employees...  Cast members.  So Mickey could just pop out instead of having to walk through the entire park to go...  Yeah.  Exactly.  ...go to a section.  ...trudging.  Get out of my way.  To a section.  So that's why you never see anyone where they're not supposed to be.  Mm.  I think that's real.  Very tricky.  All right.  That Walt.  We're going to take a break. 
[01:50:30]  We got Jackie the Joke Man joining the program next.  Also, Homeless Mustard should be here in a little bit.  We're going to get an update from him.  Supposedly 90 days sober and playing his first gig this weekend.  Mm-hmm.  We'll see what's been going on in his life.  And we got to bring Oscar the Intern back on the show.  All right.  What a hit from this morning.  Let's do that as well.  But first, I think we got Boo got shot with the translation because it was hard to translate  what she was saying.  Translation.  Check this out.  Uh-huh.  She was taking real bad.  It appears the young lady was trembling from nervousness. 
[01:51:00]  And she said, Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  Someone has been wounded.  I said, who, who?  I inquired as to who the victim was.  She said, Boo got shot.  Boo has suffered a gunshot.  Boo got shot.  Boo has become the victim of another violent crime.  I said, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, me, oh, my.  We just saw it.  My suicide called somebody or a pimp.  My sibling telephoned another relative.  She called my cousin Pumpkin to sell dust.  In fact, it was my cousin Pumpkin who lives in this very same community. 
[01:51:30]  She called her and Pumpkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  Pumpkin was already on the phone with the local authorities.  And Chi-Chi, she had left out.  Chi-Chi had already departed.  She went and got in her car.  She bailed out.  She found her vehicle and put it in reverse.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again.  As she was departing, a shot rang out, piercing the cold night air.  When I heard the gunshot and I seen someone had run in the building over that way.  Apparently, the perpetrator was seeking cover behind a local building. 
[01:52:00]  He ran in that building.  It was that building over there.  And I seen that car just flew off.  I saw the car depart with a rapid acceleration.  And then I seen a long gun.  I saw a firearm of substantial caliber.  A big old gun in it.  I mean substantial caliber.  The boy was in the backseat, he had a big old long gun.  In fact, it was the gentleman in the backseat who had the firearm with the extended barrel.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:52:30]  Mysterious XM.  He's insane.  Colin Cain in studio.  He knows how it works.  Colin, you promoting anything?  Comics, August 12th, I'll be there.  All right.  And with that, Jackie, the joke man, has entered the studio.  Let's make believe he wasn't in here for five minutes.  Oh, let's see.  Trying to do a little theater.  Ruining the whole thing that's supposed to come off sounding spontaneous.  And then he walks in as we came back, which is very strange. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  That's the way to do it, though.  You want the guests to arrive as you go back live on the air.  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  And you said, how are ticket sales at Trump Marina?  And I said, I don't ask.  And you know what happens?  At some point, you know, you start doing comedy or show business and you think that there's a certain level where you've made it.  In your mind, you think that there's going to be that level.  And when I met Rodney and got lucky enough, Rodney invited me to go with him. 
[01:53:30]  Rodney Dangerfield invited me to go with him to Las Vegas.  And if anybody had made it, I mean, it's like 1980.  I mean, he hadn't done all his movies yet, but he was already an icon.  Sure.  So there's a guy who's made it.  Bob Hope, Rodney Dangerfield.  Here's a guy who's made it.  Excuse me.  And we go to Las Vegas, pull up in the limo.  I mean, it couldn't have been more big time.  We walk into the Aladdin Hotel.  The first thing the guy does is runs to the box office to find out how sales are. 
[01:54:00]  And I said, I'm telling you, it was the biggest epiphany.  I was like, it never ends.  You know what I mean?  Here's Rodney Dangerfield.  If anybody should not care if he sold a ticket or not.  It would be Rodney.  It would be Rodney.  He ran right to the box office to get the number.  It was a big gas shortage right then.  It was 1980.  There used to be lines around.  You guys weren't born yet.  There was lines around the block to get gas.  I remember that.  There's nobody in the goddamn town.  And he's all concerned about ticket sales.  And that's, I said right then, I said, I don't want to worry about this the rest of my life. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  You think at some point somebody's going to say, all right, you've made it.  No more worries about ticket sales.  Sure.  It just doesn't happen.  You're constantly, yeah, trying to figure out if you're there yet.  Right.  Joan Rivers was talking about that same thing, where she continues to worry about how many  people are going to be at the show.  It's ridiculous.  And I know, I know, I have a gut feeling I've sold like dozens of tickets.  It could be tens of tickets.  So what do you do?  You just go in there, and then if there's a good crowd, you fucking feel good. 
[01:55:00]  If there's not a good crowd, you do your show.  You blame the promoter.  You say, that fucking asshole.  You try to figure out who to fucking blame.  Yeah, exactly.  God bless a bad economy, you know?  Yeah.  Got all those excuses.  You could always blame the economy.  Hey, Christine Aguilera canceled her whole tour.  You know, we're suffering one night.  Relax.  Lighten up, you know?  Actually, yeah.  Tickets across the board weigh the fuck down.  Yeah.  No one's going to shows like they used to.  Right, and there's nobody in Atlantic City, but there will be people in Atlantic City Saturday  night.  Yes.  Because there's a big show at Trump Marina. 
[01:55:30]  At the Shell, at Trump Marina.  It's a good room.  That is such a great room.  I saw Bob Kelly there.  It's a good room.  It's 600 people, and it's small, and nice little box, and great sound system.  I just love it.  Yeah, it's good.  You gamble at all?  You know what?  I don't gamble, and I don't drink.  You used to drink, though, right?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I used to drink so much that I used to forget that I didn't gamble, but I have a great time.  You know?  What was your poison when you were drinking?  Yes.  Just everything? 
[01:56:00]  You know, I was a beer drinker.  You know, Budweiser drinker.  I mean, on the Stern Show, they went on and on and on about how many Heineken's I drank,  and I never drank a Heineken, but...  But they were the sponsor.  Starting in 1985, I realized that I can't drink and do my act, because that's going to be  too crazy.  Luckily, because I quit drinking...  Wait, 85 you were done?  No, no, no.  But I'm saying in 1985, I realized I shouldn't drink on stage.  Okay.  And thank God, because if I had been drinking on stage, that means when I quit drinking,  I would have had to relearn show business. 
[01:56:30]  But I quit drinking in 1985.  So since 1985, I've drank water out of a beer can, I mean, out of a beer bottle on stage,  like the Pied Piper, lead them into the sea, right?  Yeah.  And it was really funny, because I drink beer and drink...  And then when we switched to Heineken, I mean, when they started promoting me as the big  Heineken guy, I'd be up there with a Heineken bottle full of water.  And the first night I worked at Rascals, drinking Heineken out of a beer bottle, water out of  a Heineken bottle, Mark from Rascals came up and said, Jackie, normally when you're here, 
[01:57:00]  we sell two bottles of Heineken.  He said, we sold out all four cases.  He said, those people should be paying you a fortune, because when people drink Heineken,  because you're drinking Heineken, the next night when they go out, they drink Heineken  again, because they're drinking Heineken, which I did the joke, man.  You know, I never got anything out of it.  But it'd be funny, because I drink Heineken and Heineken, and then I'd do stump the joke,  man, and I'd have the girl bring me a light beer.  But I'd really be drinking beer.  People are like, wow, you switch from...  And once in a while, somebody in the front go, how come there's no foam in that?  But it's power of suggestion. 
[01:57:30]  I don't be up there drinking a Perrier, you know, so I'm up there pounding down the water,  and it's, you know, a little theater.  That's what people expected.  Yeah.  But I was a Budweiser guy.  You know, I drank Jack Daniels and beer in the 70s, and then I went to Budweiser in the  80s, and then Bud Light in the 90s.  So in my mind, I was tapering over three decades.  And I swear that's a true story. 
[01:58:00]  You've got to do those things slowly.  Slowly.  I used to drink Jack Daniels, but that shit would kill you, man.  Yeah, that would literally kill you, man.  I mean, every so often, every so often, a nice Jack and Ginger or something like that  tastes good.  Just to change it up.  You know that Anthony's got kegs in his house now.  Stop it.  I wound up getting a...  You have one of those refrigerators with the tap in it?  It's not a refrigerator with a tap.  I have a bar that has, if you're going to any bar, it's the same thing.  The big stainless steel doors that open up, and the kegs, the full-size kegs. 
[01:58:30]  Excuse me, aren't we successful?  Aren't we successful, Tony?  You know, when you want, you're able to get a few things you wanted, but as a kid...  How many vices do you have?  I always wanted kegs.  But he gets two.  He gets Guinness and Bud Light.  And Bud Light.  So you not just have a tap.  You have a choice.  Yeah, yeah.  You got a couple of choices up there.  I hail that.  I have no vices.  I go to the Cannes Film Festival every year.  I can't afford it.  But that's my only vice. 
[01:59:00]  I don't buy Coke.  I don't go out and drink.  I don't have expensive taste, so I do.  You know, you do something for yourself.  Yeah.  That's your thing?  You like checking out the films?  Yeah.  I'm sneaking into the film business.  I'm doing a good job.  Are you?  My manager's with me, John Starbeck, and we are doing everything.  We are great guns.  I got two films booked.  The film where I was making out with Florence Henderson finally is coming out.  Oh, shit.  I'm French kissing Florence Henderson.  She licks mustard and ketchup off my face.  Venus in Vegas.  And it's a fun movie. 
[01:59:30]  There's a lot of stars in it.  We did the movie years ago, and now the people have been Jamie Presley, Donald Faison, you  know, people that just did a movie, and then all of a sudden it'll sell a DVD, you  know.  And it's fun doing movies, you know.  It's goofy.  I lost 50 pounds.  I'm ready for my...  I'm going to be rich in time to die.  Yeah, what'd you do?  Diet or you're working out or something?  Riding a bike, swimming, walking on the beach, on the treadmill, and I stopped eating pizza  and bread and stuff like that, and I lost 50, more than 50 pounds. 
[02:00:00]  I'm in the greatest shape of my life.  But you miss the pizza?  That's the problem.  You miss the shit you get up.  You know what?  Forget pizza.  If I go to dinner, and the waiter puts down the thing of bread, I tell the people with  me, I say, are you going to eat any of that?  Because if you're not, get it out of here.  Get it out of here.  I'm telling you, a piece of bread looks like chocolate cake.  If you're not eating carbs...  I'm not kidding.  It's like...  You do crave it.  Throw some butter on that.  Oh, shut up.  I know.  It's terrible.  It really is bad.  Want to get some right now? 
[02:00:30]  Booze is so funny.  God.  Yeah, it's...  But it goes through the kegs quickly, too.  Well, I have a lot of parties at my house, too.  You like to entertain.  Whether I'm there or not.  It's not like I get a lot of imitations.  Yeah, I have that disease, too.  There's a party at your house.  He would go to your house, eh?  Yeah.  I don't drink.  I'm a drag.  Yeah, but he's got a pool.  He's got a jacuzzi.  He's got topless girls.  I'm there.  Jimmy doesn't drink.  It's sort of like turning into a Playboy mansion, sort of.  Wow. 
[02:01:00]  This summer has been exceptional, as far as the parties go.  People come and go in at his house all the time.  I do look, though, like, as we sit here, I have security cameras up that I could see at  my house and see who comes over.  See if there's anybody worth going home for.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, I zoom in on some of the chairs and lounge chairs, see who's there.  Like, oh, great.  How many people have an open invite to your house?  They could show up any time at this point.  There's quite a few.  There's probably a dozen or so.  Yeah, about a dozen can show up and just, yeah.  Nice day.  They want to go in the pool? 
[02:01:30]  What the fuck?  That's fun.  Not in my house.  They just go in the backyard.  They've got everything they need.  The cabana's got a pisser and shitter in it, so.  Yeah, I live on the Sound.  I got an outdoor shower, and I'm like, come over.  I don't have to be there.  You know, walk on the beach, swim out to the float.  You know, have a good time.  I like when people use it.  You got a float?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to love that when my grandma had a house in Waiting River, having the raft in  the middle of the fucking sound.  When I was, like, five years old, there was a float out on Long Island Sound.  I'd go to my uncle's, and we'd swim out to the float.  So years later, you got a few bucks? 
[02:02:00]  You got to get a float.  My wife at the time, Nancy Sirianni, she commissioned a float.  And Carl Tinker West built me a float and a tank, a huge metal tank that'll cook 100 lobsters  at a time.  And if you look on Google, Carl Tinker West, he was Bruce Springsteen's first manager and  told him not to sign with Bill Graham.  I mean, I got the most ridiculous stories that mean absolutely nothing.  I mean, he's the guy that made the big 100 lobster, the Holocaust fucking lobster tank. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  It's a baby coffin.  You can't cook the lobsters out in the float, right?  No, no.  That's two different things.  You're two different.  Okay.  Two completely.  I don't want to know about the float.  Is it a boring float?  Just a bunch of planks?  Or you got something going on out there?  You know, although one time we had a party and there was a guy out there in a tuxedo serving  shots.  Doing one of our parties.  This friend of ours said, listen, we got to perk this party up.  And he's out there in a full tuxedo, sweating his balls off, making shots, vodka with caviar 
[02:03:00]  in it.  I think it's some kind of stupid shot.  You guys, I don't know.  Well, there was also, we remember the famous Jetty.  Well, that's the Jetty.  The Jetty.  What's the Jetty story?  The Jetty is Robin, who's a black woman who knows nothing about swimming or the beach,  referring to a float in the middle of Long Island Sound as a Jetty.  The Jetty.  And every year we'd launch the Jetty.  We'd push it down.  We'd have hundreds of people and push the Jetty and eat lobster.  I used to serve lobster.  Two hundred people, they'd eat lobster until they puked. 
[02:03:30]  And then Howard would go on the air and tell everybody how cheap I was.  Every summer.  I still meet people like, oh, you cheap bastard.  How are you doing, you cheap bastard?  I think Howard's the cheap one.  He's a campaign.  I ain't going there.  But every summer I'd hear about that fucking Jetty story.  And the stories were endless.  It got lost.  One day.  Yeah, yeah.  It floated away.  About 15 years ago, it was so cold that the Long Island Sound actually froze.  And that happens very rarely.  And in those days, I didn't used to bring it around. 
[02:04:00]  I just left it out for the winter.  And what happened is when it started to melt, the huge sheet of ice, however big, broke off  and went out.  And it took with it the Jetty with the anchor.  I mean, because it was so huge.  And I used to go down in the winter and smoke a joint and look out at my stupid float.  And it wasn't there.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  So I came in and I said, listen, I want to make an announcement.  And they always broke my balls.  I said, listen, if anybody happens to be out on the Long Island Sound, my float's missing. 
[02:04:30]  And you can't miss it because there's a ladder.  And they made you jerk.  What are you, an idiot wasting our time?  What do you think?  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm telling you, five minutes later.  Someone found the float.  Gary comes in and says, how?  The National County police boat just called.  You can get around on the sound.  There's nothing on the sound in the winter.  So they got the eyeglasses.  They spotted it.  They found my float.  They dragged it back.  Pulled it around.  I went over and got it at the Oyster Bay Marina.  Gave everybody, you know, cassette tapes.  It was like a typical stupid Jackie thing that made me no money. 
[02:05:00]  And it was hysterical.  We always found my grandma's float down the beach.  You know, a mile or two.  You always found it.  Right.  Because, you know, you don't have a big enough anchor.  Sometimes you drag it back.  Other times like that.  Sometimes a little busted up.  Yeah, we'll build a new one.  What the hell?  Get your hammer and nails out.  Yeah, the Amish.  You know, the Amish.  Do it yourself.  North Shore and South Shore are so different as far as even people go.  You know, you get that South Shore mentality of Long Island and the North Shore.  So goddamn different.  The sound and then the Great South Bay. 
[02:05:30]  You get the Bay Shore.  We were talking about Bay Shore chicks before with the big hair.  It's unbelievable what a different world it is.  It's, what is it, 20 miles from the North Shore to the South Shore?  Long Island Expressway just cuts it in half.  The Expressway is like the Mason Dixon line.  You know, we never went south of Long Island Expressway.  That was like another country for us.  Oh, my cousin's husband refused to acknowledge that there was anything south of Jericho Turnpike.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you know, the sand down there is so fine.  And people come up to the North Shore and they're like, how can you walk on these rocks? 
[02:06:00]  And meanwhile, you go, I can still remember going to Jones Beach for four days trying to  get the sand out of your balls.  You know what I'm talking about?  It's like powdered sugar down there.  Right, right.  And then, yeah, up on the North Shore, you had these prehistoric fucking horseshoe crabs  and rocks and all kinds of shit.  I forgot about those kids.  Those things would scare the crap out of me.  It was like something from fucking...  Yeah, why do they continue to survive, those horseshoe crabs?  I think they've been around...  They're like cockroaches, you know. 
[02:06:30]  And they're always screwing.  You always see them connected, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  One hump and the other.  Like a daisy chain.  What else are you going to do with your fucking...  Awkward looking little creature.  Horshoe crab.  Growing up, though, on Long Island, it was a lot more wildlife.  I remember growing up and just seeing fucking...  You go into the woods and there's snapping turtles and fucking newts and chameleons and all  kinds of other fucking...  Like Africa.  Well, because it's the woods.  You know, it's great.  You ever read about like Center Island, Bayville, they used to be, you know, in the 1800s. 
[02:07:00]  I'm not talking about in the 1200s.  In the 1800s, there were bobcats and bears and all kinds of stuff.  You know, I would love to see that stuff.  You got to think there's one still around somewhere.  I'm tired.  A straight bobcat's got to be out there.  My sister-in-law came up with the three kids last week.  And all of a sudden, her 18-year-old son, I don't know him that well.  And he's a real nice kid.  He comes upstairs.  Now, he's never been in my house before.  And he's down in the basement.  My doors are open and I got a cat door, you know. 
[02:07:30]  And he goes, there's a possum downstairs.  And I'm like, I'm thinking, oh, this kid's a little wacky.  Because I've lived in Bayville for 40 years.  I've never seen a possum, let alone had one in my house.  And I'm thinking, well, this kid's a little wacky.  And now my cat, Jake, looks like a cat.  It looks like a tiger.  It's a bad mistake.  And I said, are you sure?  He said, no, there was a possum right at my feet.  Like, you know, a foot and a half long.  And I'm thinking, he's wacky.  And two days later, I walk downstairs. 
[02:08:00]  There's a possum in my house.  I don't know how the hell it got in.  Whether it came in through the cat door or if there's some kind of.  But a possum.  I mean, what are the odds?  You know.  Cat door, yeah.  Well, I got fucking raccoons now in my attic.  But how did you get the possum out first?  And then we'll move on.  The point is, I don't know if it's still down there.  I saw it.  Was it like a basement kind of thing?  Yeah, it's my basement.  No, it's not a finished basement.  But it's pretty nice.  It's got rugs.  This is where I do my laundry and do my mailing.  So you just left it down there.  Yeah, and if I see him again, then I'll put a trap down there and catch him and set him loose. 
[02:08:30]  Because Anne's got the raccoon problem.  Yeah, I got a raccoon problem in my house.  Guys came in to fix my air conditioning.  And they come down and they go, you got raccoons living in your attic.  Like, what the fuck?  And work, but don't like to work if there's a raccoon.  They're scary raccoons.  No, no.  Raccoons can be really nasty.  So now there's traps on the outside of my house.  Have you seen them since we talked about it on the air?  No.  These fucking things know that there's a trap set.  But I don't know how they figured it out.  The first night that he set the traps, I go out, before I'm going to bed, I figure, let 
[02:09:00]  me go out and check the traps.  So I go out and I see glowing eyes in the trap.  I go, fuck, that was fast.  I walk up.  It's open.  You son of a bitch.  A little cat in the trap.  Like, you dumb little shit.  So now I've got to figure out how to open this thing up.  And I let him out and then reset it again.  And since then?  Nothing.  Not hide the hair of any of those fucking raccoons.  You know, my house, I expanded the kitchen, knocked down a wall and chopped off a piece 
[02:09:30]  of the house and put a big picture window.  But while the guy was doing that, there was a time where the house was totally insecure  and had a big piece of canvas hanging there, right?  So anything could go in and out.  But, you know, you're doing construction.  One night I came home from a gig.  It's like two o'clock in the morning.  I'm stoned.  I walk in.  And I sat down in my hallway and my kitty comes over and I'm playing with my kitty.  And I knew it was late.  And I had a roommate at the time, this guy, Kevin Kelly, my dear friend. 
[02:10:00]  I go, Kelly, I know it's late, but, you know, I just want to tell you I love you, man.  You know, I'm just I'm hanging down here with Jake.  He says, what are you talking about?  I said, yeah, you know, just hanging.  He goes, what do you mean?  What do you mean you're with Jake?  I said, I'm here with Jake.  He goes, well, then what's on my bed?  There was a raccoon on his bed.  Because it was just a canvas.  The animals were coming.  He freaked out.  And we chased him like two little girls were like hiding from it.  Oh, man, it was the greatest. 
[02:10:30]  You ever deal with bats?  I've never had to deal with it.  Bats will freak you the fuck out.  There ain't many things that they really give me to willies.  And there's lots of bats in Bayville, but I haven't seen any in a while.  We used to get a bat in our house in Huntington all the time.  They are so.  And I used to sleep.  It's about dusk when you see them doing those bat moves.  They are really prehistoric.  I used to sleep on my couch a lot in Huntington, and one was circling over my head all night.  I didn't even know it until morning.  It got in the house?  Yeah, until morning.  I had this feeling that something wasn't right while I was sleeping. 
[02:11:00]  And sure enough, in the morning, it was because now it's daylight.  It's just in the corner hanging out.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  Then we took the fire extinguisher.  And it was one of those powder jobbers.  And it completely destroyed my kitchen trying to, you know.  And the bat's fine.  Well, they say if you hit it with the fire extinguisher, it mellows out.  Yeah, CO2 one, not a chemical.  And then you could get it outside.  But I didn't know it was a powder fucking fire extinguisher.  And as soon as I shot it, it was too late to turn back.  So I'm like, oh, fuck it.  Might as well keep going.  Well, that's what I want is fire extinguisher powder in my kitchen. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  It'll never go away.  That'll be easy to get rid of.  It never goes away.  You live on the beach like that.  You swim a lot.  That's how I lose.  I swim and swim and swim.  I swim like.  And the sound?  Yeah, like a half mile a day.  It's not creepy.  Why?  Why is it creepy?  Monsters under there.  It is so beautiful.  I swim from May till November.  You know, it's like, it's incredible.  Are you that?  Once in a while, you see, you know, a horseshoe crab or. 
[02:12:00]  Do you see sharks out there?  I don't even like.  I don't see nothing.  The fish jump like crazy.  Especially right now.  It's August.  The snappers.  Creeps me out.  You know what would really creep you out if you're creeped out by the water?  I guess growing up on the North Shore, I know we used to get drunk and go swimming.  But I never saw this when I was a kid.  So I don't know if it's a new phenomenon or whether it's just something we didn't notice.  Go ahead.  But I come home late at night.  Every time I get home, whether it's 11 o'clock or 4 in the morning, I go put on my bathrobe and go down,  and take a naked swim.  I just do it.  It's the good.  You get Chrissy from Jaws? 
[02:12:30]  I come back.  It's fucking night time.  I take a hot shower and you sleep like a baby.  But when you go swimming at night, not every night, but almost every night, as you swim, there's fluorescent jellyfish.  Oh, the phosphorus.  That's got to be cool.  Remember when Tinkerbell would go like this and then it would be like the sparkles.  It's like you see the sparkles, but sometimes it's globs, like the size of like a marble or a tennis ball because they're jellyfish that when there's movement in the water, they get fluorescent. 
[02:13:00]  But it's beautiful.  And when you're swimming and it's like with each stroke, it lights up.  It's beautiful.  But to somebody who's a little freaked out by what's in the water, they'd be like, ah, get me out of here.  I think Jackie's getting the good pod is what I'm saying.  No.  Come to my house.  You know, I say that to people and they tell me, yeah, possum and fluorescent.  Good, good.  Keep rolling up.  I'm going to knock on your doors someday.  I would love you.  I would love you guys to come over and go.  Now, the main road to Bayville, right? 
[02:13:30]  Do you go left or right?  I listen to you.  You go over the bridge, you go left.  That's what I thought.  Okay.  And then you go to the right.  What's the gated fucking community with that little island?  Oh, that's where I ride my bike.  That's Center Island.  That Center Island is fucking gorgeous.  But it's in the middle of nowhere.  Rupert Murdoch owns the house that my brother's high school girlfriend used to live in.  We used to get stoned and ride the dumbwaiter in the house.  Billy Joel lives there.  You know, I'll make this story quick. 
[02:14:00]  I would rather live left, by the way, because, you know, you're with real people.  Yeah, because it's so separated.  It's the greatest bike ride.  But the houses on Center Island are a forget about it.  It's some of the most exclusive real estate in the world.  Let me tell you this story.  I'll make it as quick as I can.  If it's interesting, you can take all the time.  There's a very, very funny guy named Ron Zimmerman who was a comedian from Washington.  So he knew Howard from Washington.  And I've always been in contact with him.  And he hated stand-up.  And we used to do stand-up together.  And I loved it. 
[02:14:30]  And I loved playing with the audience.  And this is the kind of guy who would insult somebody just so, you know, so he could go  loggerheads with him.  And he's a real popular guy.  He's a great writer.  He wins Emmys.  You know, he lives in Los Angeles now.  And he used to have a thing in his act.  He was so funny.  He was so dirty.  But he used to say, you know, guy that wrote that James Bond theme, da-da-da, da-da, da-da.  Do you know that son of a bitch?  See how much money that guy makes? 
[02:15:00]  It's in every movie.  And every time they play the movie or you hear that sound, every time, da-da, da-da, da-da.  That guy makes so much fucking money.  You know, he probably has a doorbell that goes, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  You know that motherfucker probably has a dog that goes, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.  Okay.  30 years later, I'm riding my bike in Center Island, the beautiful Center Island.  Guy pulls over.  He's a pool cleaner.  He says, Jack, how you doing?  I used to play at Neptunes.  My band played at Neptunes when you guys played in the 70s. 
[02:15:30]  You don't remember me, but we used to have a great time.  How you doing?  He says, yeah, I clean pools, but I do them on the North Shore because it's so beautiful.  It's so much fun.  So I keep riding.  I get almost to the very end.  You go down to Billy Joel's house, you go right, go all the way to the end, then you  have to turn around.  It's a 10-mile bike ride.  It's the most beautiful thing in the world.  And there's a big do not enter.  You cannot enter.  You get to the end of the island.  Just as I'm getting there, he comes by again because he's finished whatever he just did.  And he says, you know what? 
[02:16:00]  Follow me.  So I follow him.  He says, I know you grew up on Long Island and the North Shore, and you've seen it all,  but you've got to see this.  So I follow this guy, and we go to, and I've seen all those houses on the North.  You've seen them.  I mean, we pull into this house.  I pull up behind him on my bike, and it is this incredible, old, beautiful house.  There's a pool house that's old and ornate that's the size of a mansion that houses the 
[02:16:30]  indoor pool, and there's rolling grass going down, gazebos, and there's a huge pool house  with the outdoor pool, and there's a complete, from Oyster Bay, like from Sagamore Hill all  the way to the Bayville Bridge, you see the entire panorama.  It is the most incredible place.  I'm like, holy Christ, John, I've seen it all, but holy Jesus Christ.  I said, who the fuck lives here?  And he goes, John Barry.  I said, John Barry, who's that? 
[02:17:00]  He says, you know, he's a composer.  He's done a lot of movies.  He did the James Bond scene.  I said, I'm in fucking Rod Zimmerman's act.  Look at this.  He's saying that guy's got so much money, and here I am.  It's a true story.  You're apparently right with that dumb little thing.  I made him a bloody fortune.  That was a dog.  I was waiting for the dog to go bark, bark, bark, bark.  I know that sounds like horse.  That's a totally true story.  That's classic.  There's not much fucking money in that.  With that, we should take a break. 
[02:17:30]  We got Jackie the Joke Man hanging out with us today.  We got a homeless guy that cleaned up his act.  Oh, I thought he meant me.  I said, Jake, he saw my bank account.  I quit staring at my bank.  My accountant told me I did a 9-11 to my bank account.  Oh, shit.  You said we're not going there.  I was trying to help you out before.  You said don't go there.  Wow.  But he's a homeless guy, and we're going to get an update.  That's cool, right?  You're just hanging and going with the flow, right?  I'm giving him tickets to Trump Marina. 
[02:18:00]  He might just go.  Tomorrow night, Jackie the Joke Man will be at the show at Trump Marina, Atlantic City,  New Jersey.  If you're in the area, definitely stop in and check out the show, or go to JoeGland.com.  All the information's on JoeGland.com.  Do you play Stump the Joke Man on radio?  Of course.  I'll play it on the way back to my apartment.  You want to try a round of them, maybe?  Oh, sure.  And I got two new jokes for you.  You know what?  Let's put some jokes out there.  Somebody might have been listening to my show.  We have two listeners.  What's the worst thing a girl can hear when she's blowing Willie Nelson? 
[02:18:30]  Okay.  And how do you get a redneck to suck your cock?  If anybody comes up with the answers to either of those, we will give them two tickets to Trump  Marina.  That's what we'll do.  No, no.  Plus, they can call him to try and stump me.  Sure.  But they're two great jokes.  I saw a long-lost relative, and her opening line to me was, how do you get a redneck to  suck your cock?  Before I got a chance to say, is it okay with the family that I'm a dirty comedian?  And what's the worst thing a girl can hear?  When she's blowing Willie Nelson. 
[02:19:00]  And any other jokes.  And those two jokes stumped you, Jackie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is very rare.  It is, and it isn't.  You know, now that I have the reputation, the whole world comes out with jokes.  So, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  The thing is, I know more, probably five times more of the answers than anybody else.  You know, it's like, I don't hit a thousand.  Right.  But I, you know.  All right, let's put Homeless Mustard on standby.  We've got to get the answer to those two jokes, and you could also try to stump Jackie the  Joke Man.  Well, let's go to commercial on joke.  Let me tell you a joke. 
[02:19:30]  And Colin, you're talking way too much today.  Yeah, shut the fuck up.  I'm sorry, man.  I apologize.  I enjoy listening.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on The Virus, Sirius XM.  Busy show today.  We've got Colin Cain in the studio.  Also, Jackie the Joke Man, who's playing the shell at Trump Marina tomorrow night.  It's going to be a great show.  So go to jokeland.com for your tickets, I guess, or Ticketmaster. 
[02:20:00]  How do they get the tickets for this jacket?  I think it's Ticketmaster or one of those things.  But if you go to jokeland.com, there's a, you know, there's the link.  You just, everything's a click away nowadays.  What I like about Trump Marina, I've stayed at a lot of the hotels down there.  Trump Marina, though, you can go right outside onto the boardwalk and see some real action.  It's a really, really great place.  That boardwalk is just amazing for people watching, which is one of my favorite things to do in the world.  And there's nothing like the boardwalk.  The boardwalk in Atlantic City, you know, rich people, poor people. 
[02:20:30]  I love walking up and down, and, you know, I've been on a diet for like a year.  So when you're walking up and down, the smells, you know, the clams and the saltwater taffy, it's just fun, you know.  As soon as you said clams, I was thinking I'm going to get pussy.  Oh, Jesus, Christmas.  Sorry.  Hey, so we're going to play Stump the Joke Man with Jackie.  You got a joke you don't think Jackie knows the answer to, or the punchline to, I should say.  And then we want the answer to the two jokes you said before the break.  I'm going to give you two setups, and then I'm going to tell you a joke. 
[02:21:00]  What's the worst thing a girl can hear while she's blowing Willie Nelson?  And how do you get a redneck to suck your cock?  All right, if you know that, you're going to get tickets to the show this weekend if you're local.  Before that, though, Sam just ran in here.  Jim Norton's not here today.  He's in Atlanta at the punchline, and he went on local TV down there.  Yeah, Good Day Atlanta.  Good Day Atlanta.  Did you have to do those shows, Jackie, the Good Day shows ever?  I did one when I was working Zaney's in Nashville, and I did one of those morning shows with Paul Williams. 
[02:21:30]  I'll never forget it.  You know Paul Williams, the little tiny singer-songwriter?  And he actually, I got to know him a little bit because he was headlining with Rodney when we were at the LADN,  but he was a great guy, and he said something that I still remember 35 years later.  They said, wow, you wrote Evergreen with Barbra Streisand.  You wrote so many great hits.  He said, yeah, but there were some songs I wrote that just missed.  And they said, like what?  He said, brown Christmas.  I just think that's just a funny line. 
[02:22:00]  All those little shows were so great.  You know, the guy's the host, and then he runs over and starts to tape.  You know, one of those things.  Well, Jimmy.  Old school.  Old school.  Jimmy just got in trouble down there in Atlanta.  He was on Good Day Atlanta.  He cursed?  Well, this is how it went down.  And he got the host very uncomfortable.  So when you look around and you look at some of the comics that are out there now,  when you think about doing a project with someone, has that come up yet?  Or who would you like to work with or opposite of? 
[02:22:30]  I'll work with or opposite anybody on television who will have me.  I'm 42 years old.  I'm not picky.  Play the wacky neighbor.  Okay.  You start out in showbiz.  You're like, I have integrity.  Believe me, I'm the biggest whore in the business.  Whatever you need, I will do.  Whoa.  All right.  I'll work with anybody.  All right.  It's a morning show.  We got to.  So we're going to.  Oh, okay.  I'm the biggest sellout in the business.  Don't say the W word.  What?  That's what he gets uncomfortable.  What year was this tape?  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:23:00]  An hour ago.  Whore is.  He's so funny.  The W word.  Stop the guy in his tracks with that.  And the guy was not feigning it.  He was like thrown.  Yeah.  At least he said the W word.  Voss would have been like, oh, the H word.  I can't use the H word.  And if we know Norton, he doesn't like when people do that to him.  No, not at all.  So I'm surprised he didn't come back with, you know.  Well, at the end of the show, he kind of apologized.  Yeah.  Well, he tried to.  For real? 
[02:23:30]  But they.  Norton doesn't apologize.  He apologized.  You know, he was being a good sport.  But they gave him an opening and he took it.  All right.  It's going to be a great show.  I hope so.  Yeah.  It was good last night.  But, you know, let's hope tonight is good, too.  All right.  Come on out, people.  Absolutely.  Jim, what a pleasure.  Thank you for having me.  Yeah.  Sorry I said that naughty word.  I hope I didn't, like, lose any audience for you.  Which word was that?  The whore word.  Oh.  There you go.  There you go.  You dummies.  That's great.  Oh, did he just said that?  That's wonderful.  You dummies.  Jimmy. 
[02:24:00]  We laughed over.  That was great.  Hold on a second.  There you go.  Never ask which word.  Why would you ask?  Why would you ask?  That is typical Jimmy right there.  Oh, wonderful.  You never know where people's sensitivities lie or where their lines are.  It's just frightening.  Horrors, there's nothing.  You go down to an Atlanta TV show, though, I guess people get a little, oh, what the hell's  that?  I watch this show with my children.  We can handle dirty words. 
[02:24:30]  I think we can.  It's time.  The whole shocking thing is it's done.  I always say this.  When you're two clicks away from a man dying from being fucked by a horse on a computer,  how shocking is hearing the whore?  Wait a minute.  You're one click away from that girl with the greatest jugs I've ever seen in my life.  I don't even have to click.  They're up there constantly.  There you go.  God damn.  Well, Jackie, you got the phones.  There aren't the rules.  Now, hold on, Opie.  This is the third time I'm breaking in, Anthony.  I'm telling my joke.  You won't let me tell my joke. 
[02:25:00]  I'm telling my joke.  Oh, yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, guy gets a new job.  So to celebrate, he gets himself a new suit, new pair of shoes, gets a pair of black patent  leather shoes.  He goes out to a dance.  He's dancing with a girl.  He says, you know, I really like a girl that wears white polka dot panties.  She says, I didn't know I'm wearing white polka dot panties.  He says, I saw the reflection in my shiny new black patent leather shoes.  That's another girl dances.  You know, I really like a girl that wears black lace underwear.  I didn't know I'm wearing black lace underwear.  He says, I saw the reflection in my shiny new black patent leather shoes. 
[02:25:30]  He says, there's another girl dancing.  He looks down.  He looks down.  He says, what do you got on under that dress?  She says, nothing.  He says, I thought I had a crack in my shiny new black patent leather shoes.  I see you can get away with that on radio because it's satellite.  All right, here we go.  People want to try to stump the joke, man.  And we got to get the answer to those two jokes.  Let's start with Brian in Virginia.  Brian.  Hey, Brian.  Hey, guys. 
[02:26:00]  How y'all doing today?  Good, Brian.  All right, here's my joke.  What does Tiger Woods and a Christmas tree have in common?  What?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tiger Woods and a Christmas tree.  The balls.  I'm just leaving for a moment.  What?  The balls.  The colored balls.  Oh.  You got me.  Wow.  That's terrible.  That was the punchline?  Colored balls?  No, I don't know the joke.  I'm just trying to figure it out.  You figured it out.  Jackie just figures them out. 
[02:26:30]  Colored balls.  Colored?  Who used the word colored?  Colored.  Yeah, what color?  We do as a goof, actually.  We do as a goof.  All right, let's go to Footer.  Footer, you're on with Jackie the Joke Man.  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  How do you get a dog to stop humping your leg?  Pick him up and suck his cock.  You're the best.  You are the best.  You didn't skip a beat.  That was great.  You know, I've got a buddy that's married to a beautiful black woman, and he used to say  that NAACP stands for Negroes are actually colored people. 
[02:27:00]  She used to laugh at that.  Let's go to Dan on Long Island.  Dan?  Hey, Dan.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  It wasn't a joke, but I had a comparison.  I'm sorry, but the chicken fucker video and Jackie's laugh.  The chicken getting fucked sounds just like Jackie laughing.  All right, we'll have to look into that.  You know how sick I am?  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, right?  Hey, thanks.  Have you ever heard the chicken fuck video?  It's a little rough.  Eh.  Maybe we'll play for you a little later.  You know, I don't know how much of a joke you're making, but you know that down south 
[02:27:30]  the guys really do fuck chickens.  There's a guy who's dead now, this guy Paul Collins, who's an older black guy when I  lived in Oysipan.  One night we were getting drunk with him, and he told us that down south they would fuck chickens  and just when they were about to come, they would break the chicken's neck and the chicken's,  I guess, vagina or whatever hole is back there would contract.  Yeah.  And he wasn't making it up.  He wasn't, you know, he wasn't smart enough to make it up. 
[02:28:00]  He was just drunk and rambling.  Like, imagine, not only you, the only thing worse than fucking a chicken would be killing  it when you're coming inside of it.  I mean, and I, now is that what you're talking about?  We have actual audio.  I don't know if you want to go there.  Of a guy doing it?  But the, it's your show, Opie.  But you can actually tell.  You know when, when he enters the chicken.  You do?  Yeah, because I think there's a little foreplay.  There's a little petting and foreplay at first.  And then the chicken just makes a sound.  You, you can, you know.  I mean, you gotta laugh at this. 
[02:28:30]  I hate to say it, but you gotta laugh at it.  Because the chicken.  Of course, they're German.  You actually hear the chicken crying.  I hope he took the chicken out for, like, some chicken feed first or something.  And we are animal lovers here on this show.  We are.  Believe it or not.  But Travis for Jackie.  Great music.  Does it feel like it's fun?  You hinderficker.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  I'm a little wild on this horse.  Yeah, that had to be right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, gleich.  Gleich.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  It's a chicken holocaust.  And that guy said that your laugh sounds like that.  You know, it's one of those things you probably shouldn't laugh at, but you have to laugh at that.  Why is it always Germany?  I remember a million years ago, before there was any internet, people had those porn videos.  And it was a porn video.  And it was from Germany of a girl blowing a white pony. 
[02:30:00]  Do you remember that one?  That was very famous.  Very famous.  It's always German.  She was blowing a pony.  We come to the conclusion that conquered, defeated nations like Japan and Germany just  somehow have such low self-esteem that they...  Like, Japan is horrid with their fucking shitting videos and crazy anime porn.  And I think it's just being a defeated nation. 
[02:30:30]  But they...  Turns into that.  But they pixelate the pubes.  Yeah, yeah.  Pixelate the pubes out of it.  I don't know why.  Those Japanese are crazy.  I saw a thing on...  You guys have probably seen this, so stop me.  But there was one of those...  Tub girl?  I guess the modern-day version of Candid Camera.  And I don't know how they did it, but I'm sure you can Google it.  But a guy went into an outhouse that was near the water and went into the outhouse and was 
[02:31:00]  taking a dump and all of a sudden the boat pulls away and the guy and the toilet is being pulled  like on water skis while he's taking a dump.  It was like...  It was beyond funny.  I mean, you know...  I assume they have no lawyers in Japan.  Absolutely.  The lawsuits that would go on...  I want to do radio in Japan so badly.  The crap and the pee and the...  Yeah, yeah.  You ever see Tub Girl?  Oh, that's disgusting.  What is... 
[02:31:30]  I haven't seen that in a while.  It's just a picture of her, Jackie.  To your right, Danny will show you a Tub Girl.  What do you got?  So disgusting.  That's Tub Girl.  That's Tub Girl.  Jesus.  Ho!  Ho!  That's Tub Girl.  Ho!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  What the...  What?  That's Tub Girl.  She's got great aim, doesn't she?  Out one hole into another.  But what?  That's impressive.  What is it?  You gotta admit.  What?  We assume she gave herself some kind of mustard enema.  You can't not look at that.  I think she gave herself a mustard enema, and then she had to get rid of the food. 
[02:32:00]  That's horrible.  I would love to see that video backwards.  That would look great.  That's a talent.  Let's try to stump the joke, man.  We got everybody on hold now.  Richard in Florida.  Florida.  Richard.  Hey, Dick.  Good evening.  Hey, Richard.  Hey, Jackie.  What's the difference between Bigfoot and a woman's pussy?  One of them is scary and smelly, and the other one is Bigfoot. 
[02:32:30]  Pretty close.  Let's go to Dave in New Hampshire.  Dave.  Howdy.  Hey.  Hey, I get...  Hello.  Jackie, why were all the niggers killed in Vietnam?  We don't use that word.  Jesus.  You don't say Vietnam.  You say the war.  Every time the sergeant said get down, they'd get up and dance.  That's horrible.  That's one of the odds. 
[02:33:00]  Let's go to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Trying to stump Jackie here today.  JJ.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, what's the difference between a grizzly bear and a woman from Maine?  Uh, a grizzly bear, not gets picked up, a grizzly bear gets laid.  No.  Ten pounds and a flannel shirt.  Let's see.  That's been...  That was an Italian grandmother and an elephant in 1955.  Let's go to Lady Trucker.  What's up, Lady Trucker?  Good morning, fellas.  What's the grosser than shoveling dead babies off the driveway? 
[02:33:30]  Uh, shoveling dead babies off the driveway with a live one on the bottom.  No, using a snowblower.  Jeez.  What?  That's not even a joke.  That's not even a joke.  No, of course not.  I expected that out of Lady Trucker.  Yeah, we're looking for real jokes.  Pat, find one.  Yeah, Jackie, what's the difference between an oral thermometer and a rectal thermometer?  Taste.  Let's go to John in Texas.  That's still a great joke.  I like that one.  John. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, Jackie.  Uh, what is brown and rhymes with snoop?  Poop?  Dr. Dre.  It rhymes with snoop.  I know it's going to be, you know, and I might have even been able to figure that out  if I knew anything about rap, but I refuse to acknowledge that it exists.  Not a big rap fan, huh?  The world ended the day rap became a category on the Grammys.  That's how old, yeah, but I'm a jerk.  That's how you feel? 
[02:34:30]  You know what, but not anymore, but I did one of, you know, because I just, I don't like it.  You're old school.  But I love, you know, I love rhymes, you know, put it in your mouth, Mrs. Murphy, it  only weighs a quarter of a pound.  You know, I'm a fan of the rhyme, you know.  Colin, you're a rap fan.  Uh, Eminem.  Are you going to just constantly interrupt?  Seriously, Eminem.  You know what?  I'm listening to you, man.  I've enjoyed listening to you over these years, so I'm just sitting here taking it all in.  You like rap?  I do, a little, but I definitely like Eminem.  I think he's the best lyricist.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Look at you.  Really?  I'm just like, I don't know.  I don't mind it.  I like the red in Eminem.  Some of his stuff that he says, yeah, he's unbelievable.  He's prolific.  The stuff you can spit out.  All right, let's say hi to Ron as we try to stump Jackie.  Ron.  Yeah, hey, how's it going, man?  Hey, Ron.  Quick one for Jackie.  What does a black woman get when she has an abortion?  Uh, hold on.  Less welfare checks. 
[02:35:30]  What's she get?  This is something very pretty disgusting.  You're almost half right.  You get a, she gets a thank you note from welfare and a $200 reward from Crime Stoppers.  Yeah, I knew, I knew Crime Stoppers.  I knew Crime Stoppers was in there, but I didn't just want to volunteer that, you know.  Let's go to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Jackie, what's the difference between a refrigerator and a faggot?  A refrigerator doesn't scream when you yank your meat out.  Now, I have to tell you guys that I've been playing Stump the Joke Man for like 30 years  or however long. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  And there are two jokes.  That joke he just told.  And what's the difference between a Jew and a pizza?  I don't know.  A pizza doesn't scream when you put it in the oven.  Those two jokes, by a factor of 10 or 20.  You know, if I get asked 100 jokes to stump me, 40 of them are one of those two jokes.  I mean...  They always go there.  They always go there, you know.  All right, let's go to Keith in Virginia.  Keith.  Hey, Jackie, what's the difference between a blowjob and a hot dog?  I don't know. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, you want to come to my house for lunch?  Nah, you want to go to a ball game?  I went to a Met game with my old manager, Rory Rosegarden, the other night.  And he's got like 11 throw seats.  And I haven't been to either of the new stadiums.  And I was in heaven.  It was so great.  And Daryl Strawberry was...  You know, there's nothing funny.  I don't know if you guys remember Fireside Theater.  But, you know, and there's nothing funnier than the odd voice coming out of nowhere.  And we're all sitting there watching a game. 
[02:37:00]  And, you know, occasionally like, Daryl, Daryl.  You know, so finally I figured the guy figures he really should acknowledge.  He's like in the third row and he's, you know...  And he stands up and waves to the crowd and somebody yells,  Down in front!  It was just hysterical.  I want to go back and give the guy an album.  Oh, I brought...  To really excite you, I brought you a copy of my new CD, Snart.  Oh, nice.  How did they get that?  Well, you know, jokeland.com. 
[02:37:30]  I'm not here to make a plug fest, but I brought you guys...  My new CD's got a CD and it also has a DVD of Stump the Joke Man from 1988 at Rascals.  You don't even need to sound on it.  You've got to see the Jersey girls smoking cigarettes with hair.  You know, I guess it's that...  I've never seen that Jersey Shore show, but this is the forerunner to that.  You know, you can't believe the girls.  You know, the blowjob jokes and, you know, these are my tits and...  Oh, it's just priceless. 
[02:38:00]  It's called Snart, S-N-A-R-T, because tell them dirty jokes on stage?  Snart.  Snart.  It's Snart.  Yeah, it's Snart.  Let's go to Graham and PA.  You're clever with those goddamn titles there, Jackie.  Graham.  I think so.  What's up, Graham?  Hey, what do you call it?  Taco with a food stamp in it.  That's an African-American food stamp.  A fortune cookie.  Yeah, it's a Mexican fortune cookie.  Ah, whatever. 
[02:38:30]  He got it.  Oh, a taco.  A taco, I'm sorry.  All right, Charlie in New Orleans.  I can't even get my races straight.  Charlie.  Hey, Jackie, how do you keep little kids out of your front yard?  Uh-oh.  You put a picture of Michael Jackson in the backyard.  You chop one up and put him in the mailbox.  There's so many.  This is too ambiguous.  And they're all horrible.  What's your answer?  You molest them.  The greatest thing about telling jokes for a living is when people have subtle ideas. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, the subtlety.  You've got to live for the subtlety.  What's the worst thing a girl can hear when she's blowing Willie Nelson?  And how do you get a redneck to suck your cock?  And how do you get a redneck to suck your cock?  A redneck called up with the answer.  And not only answered it, but answered it in his colloquial way, which I'll explain to you,  which is just hysterical.  I think John wants to answer one of these jokes. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, John.  John in New Hampshire.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Love the show.  Jackie, I love your show, too.  I'm one of the two listeners, I guess you said.  Thank you.  How do you get a redneck to suck your cock?  How?  Dip it in ranch.  So stupid.  I guess they put ranch dressing on everything.  And, you know, I heard, you know, put ranch dressing on it.  And then the guy calls up the other night on the joke and says, dip it in ranch. 
[02:40:00]  You know, not even ranch dressing, ranch.  Yeah, I'll plug my show.  Well, 7 to 8 p.m. Eastern time on Howard 101 is Jackie's Joke Hunt.  We're doing our 186th show this Tuesday called Yo Talks.  That means they're going to start paying you soon.  Oh, please, never.  If you get to 200 shows, they start paying you.  That's what it says in my deal.  Let's go to Captain Otto.  A couple more Stump the Joke Mans.  Captain.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Jackie, what's 12 inches long and makes a woman scream? 
[02:40:30]  Crib death.  Get out of here.  Oh, fuck.  Let's go to Mark in New Hampshire.  I'd like to say your listeners are horrible, but they're the same listeners as mine.  Mark in New Hampshire.  Jackie, what do gay horses eat?  Hey.  Hey.  That is the greatest.  Let's go to Jim in Florida.  How do you get a fat girl in bed?  Piece of cake.  That's my favorite.  That's the greatest. 
[02:41:00]  Jim in Florida.  Jim.  Hey, Jackie, if you put Velcro on the ceiling to keep her from jumping on the bed, how do  you get them down?  Say that again?  If you put Velcro on the ceiling to keep them from jumping on the bed, how do you get them  down?  You give a Mexican a bat and tell them it's a piñata.  Correct.  Yeah.  That's horrible.  Damn.  Jesus.  But you know them.  Horrible, good.  Yeah, I know, but it's my job to know them.  He's got them categorized.  He's got them categorized like those porn sites. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I like how he's got to kind of go, ah, let me think.  Yeah, the Rolodex is going in his head.  Yeah, that one.  I got three checks the other day, $300 checks from Playboy.  And I'm like, this is weird.  I mean, years ago, I had the penthouse joke page for 20 years, and I used to send jokes  to Playboy, but I hadn't submitted any.  I'm like, what is going on?  And then I got an email from a guy saying, Jackie, please put me on your Jokeland email  list.  By the way, let me tell your listeners, if you like dirty jokes, all you have to do is  email me, jokeland at AOL.com, and I put your email on my list, and you get dirty jokes 
[02:42:00]  once in a while.  No salesman will call.  It's just dirty jokes.  I'm an idiot.  That's what I like to do, sharing jokes.  That's why I have no money.  I just give the shit away.  So this guy says, I would like to be on the Jokeland list, and his name was Adam Smith  or Smith Jones, whatever it is, at PlayboyEnterprises.com.  So I wrote to the guy, oh, you're on the list.  Do you know anybody at Playboy?  I got a couple checks from there the other day, and I have no idea why.  And the guy wrote back, I'm the new Party Jokes editor, and the last Party Jokes editor, 
[02:42:30]  you started forwarding me your Jokeland emails, and I love them, and I would take a couple  jokes, and I took a couple jokes and put them in a magazine and made sure you got paid.  Damn.  And he said, and now the guy doesn't forward me the emails anymore, and that's why I want  to be on the list.  So now I have a direct pipeline.  The Party Jokes editor came to me.  I think that's kind of cool.  Not only did he steal the jokes, but he stole them and paid me for them, which is pretty 
[02:43:00]  honorable.  But how often does that happen?  Growing up, that was always the second best thing about the magazine.  My favorite thing, the first time, I did an interview with Penthouse, and the guy, I  said, hey, why don't we put jokes after each of the, so they'd ask me a Q&A question, and  a Q&A, O&A, and I'd say, I do an answer and then a dirty joke, and then he said, you  know, everybody loved the dirty jokes, why don't we do a joke page?  I said, I would love to. 
[02:43:30]  And it was always someplace crazy, scattered in a magazine, but the very first time I did  it, they put it on the back of the centerfold, a la Playboy, and the first month I did it,  Amy Lee Baxter, that, Amy Lynn Baxter, who wound up being a person on the Stern Show all  the time, who's been a friend for like 20 years, she was the girl, the centerfold.  So my very first Penthouse joke page, if you hold up my jokes, you can see her snatch.  It's just like a collector's item, you know. 
[02:44:00]  With two Jews going to a bar, there's Amy's pussy!  What's the answer to the other joke, because no one's going to get it.  Ask me.  The joke?  Yeah, go ahead, Colin.  What's the worst thing?  Come on.  I only remember the fucking jokes, I just heard 15 of them.  What's the worst thing about...  What's the worst...  All right, you guys.  Is it Willie Nelson's dick?  That's all I remember.  It's the Willie Nelson joke.  What's the worst thing a girl can hear when she's blowing Willie Nelson? 
[02:44:30]  His music.  I'm not Willie Nelson.  Is that just fucking his stuff?  Thanks to Brendan Dunn, my nephew Brendan Dunn.  Him and his friend Danny Gerges came over and they always try to make me laugh.  And we laughed at that for...  That's a funny fucking joke, man.  You know, you're blowing the wrong old guy, you know.  And Willie Nelson, too.  You're just blowing an old guy.  That is a great fucking joke, man. 
[02:45:00]  It's one thing.  It's one thing if it's a Brad Pitt look-alike.  And Willie's my good friend.  We send jokes back and forth all the time.  I sent that to him.  I'm sure it made him drive off the road.  We used to love having him on the show.  We haven't had Willie on in a while.  We've got to get him back here.  Such a good guy.  Oh, he would come on just completely out of his fucking mind.  Oh, he's great.  And his daughters are both great musicians.  His daughter, Amy...  Amy's group is Folk Uke.  Her and Arlo Guthrie's daughter play ukuleles and sing songs. 
[02:45:30]  And their best song is Motherfucker Got Fucked Up Because He Got In The Way.  And I hosted a benefit for the Marijuana Policy Project and Normal in Austin with Willie Nelson and Asleep at the Wheel.  And the opening band was Folk Uke.  And Paula and Kathy...  Not Paula, but Amy Nelson and Kathy Guthrie sang Motherfucker Got Fucked Up Because He Got In The Way.  And Willie sang it with him.  So imagine the three of them singing Motherfucker Got Fucked Up Because He Got... 
[02:46:00]  And his other daughter, Paula, is a great country singer.  Like a Tanya Tucker type, you know, balls to the wall, beautiful girl, kick ass.  Are they getting attention down there in Nashville?  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  She just sent me her new out.  You know what?  I'm going to tell her to send you guys.  Send it to...  They're great guests.  They grew up...  Their father's Willie Nelson.  Yeah, of course.  They've got to have some stories.  Well, listen.  Let's take a break.  You're hanging, right, Jackie?  You know what?  I told Ant, you know, if you...  When you're done with me, just say go away.  No, we're going to talk to Homeless Monster, but I'm sure you can work off that.  And believe it or not, I can sit here and shut up.  I can. 
[02:46:30]  Well, like Colin?  Well, he's going to teach me during the break.  Colin's like, I got up early for this.  He's going to badmouth me to all the young guys.  No, not at all.  JoeClan.com, but Jackie's going to be playing the Shell at Trump Marina tomorrow night.  Go see Jackie, man.  It's a great, great show.  Thanks, Ope.  We'll continue with Homeless Muster next.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:47:00]  Busy Shell.  We got Colin Cain, Jackie the Joke Man playing the Shell at Trump Marina tomorrow night.  JoeClan.com.  And we just played Homeless Muster doing Creep.  I don't know.  I'm sure Jackie doesn't know the story of Homeless Muster, but we were doing this bit.  I want to know where the name comes from.  Well, the homeless part you can figure out, right?  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to ask.  Isn't that a funny guy?  You should start a radio show with this guy.  Mustard, Homeless Muster.  So, we were talking about what you can't do on radio anymore. 
[02:47:30]  Me and Ann had a great bit we came up with years ago called the Homeless Shopping Spray.  It was great for everybody.  You get a bunch of fucking, you know, homeless guys.  I was ready to say dirty bums, but sorry.  Oh!  And you bring them to a mall, and the listeners show up, and it's just a party for everybody.  And they buy them stuff.  And we used to like taking them to the really, you know, uptight malls, because then you see people closing their gates during the middle of Christmas shopping,  because they don't want the homeless in their freaking store. 
[02:48:00]  And it turns out, in the end, to be a really good thing for everybody.  We learned this over the years.  Honestly, we did it for the goof.  But then it turns out where the listeners are paying for everything the homeless guys want.  It's a good feeling for everyone.  Blah, blah, blah.  But great radio as well.  It's a nice thing, but I'm sure you were just totally shocked by what they wanted, right?  Oh, my God.  It just must have, not to use a bad expression, but it must have reeked of shock.  Like, you know, I want this, I want that.  Some of the guys, we'd give them money to go shop with, and half of them would end up in the bar. 
[02:48:30]  They just want to drink their money away.  Instead of getting a nice, warm coat for the winter.  Only half of them?  Yeah, only half.  Some guys would get jackets, and then you'd get one guy that didn't have anything and got Ray-Bans.  Yeah, Ray-Bans.  That's what I was going to say.  Guys would buy cell phones.  How are you going to pay the cell phone bill?  But we met...  You'd think that people like that that aren't thinking clearly, they're going to wind up homeless.  Yeah, it could happen. 
[02:49:00]  So, we...  I'm scared to laugh now, because I sound like a guy fucking a chicken.  We did the homeless shopping spree three or four years.  There's no problems whatsoever.  Not one incident.  And a couple years, we had a couple thousand listeners show up at the mall.  It was insane.  And they would get off a really nice bus, and they were like rock stars showing up at the mall.  It became...  The videos are online, if you care to check it out.  Whatever.  So, we've been trying to get the homeless shopping spree done for two or three years, and we get close every year.  And then the stupid fucking lawyers upstairs... 
[02:49:30]  Stop it!  Shut us down.  Because they're worrying about crowd control.  What's the problem?  We don't know what the problem is, because there was never a problem before.  Yeah.  The lawyers are worried about anything.  They can find a problem.  Yeah, here's one of the video clips from the shopping spree.  Yeah, look at all these...  Look at that.  It's great.  Hundreds and hundreds of people in this scene.  Hundreds.  There's over a thousand people in this fucking video right now.  What more was that?  They would sing Christmas carols. 
[02:50:00]  That's so fun!  You know, rallies, they just are inherently fun.  Yeah.  You can't have that many people assembled and not have fun.  Now, and here's the logic of dopes that have no business.  Are they afraid you're going to get sued by the homeless?  By the stores, by the mall, there might be something damaged.  And how the bid worked, you don't tell which mall you're going to.  So those people showed up with us telling them last minute what mall's going to be at, which  was like, wow, we got a little power. 
[02:50:30]  You know, you didn't have to pre-promote or nothing.  We'd load them up on the buses and just...  And then these dopes that think they know radio, they're like, well, good news.  Well, we're going to do the homeless shopping spree, but we're going to go to all the malls  and get their permission ahead of time.  And I said to these guys, that's never going to happen.  No one is going to give permission for this type of event.  You got to fucking just do it.  You're just going to do it.  And of course, so what happened this past year, they tried to get permission last minute.  I mean, permission for the malls.  And the malls, of course, are going to say no.  No.  But in that process, we met Mustard, who's outside the studio, and he came in, and he came 
[02:51:00]  in here in a bad way, and we found out he was a musician.  We give him a guitar, and he sings Radiohead's Creep.  We put the fucking video online.  It's up to 1.2 million views.  Oh, wow.  People around the world love this guy's fucking music.  But he's a mess.  Until recently, now we're here, and he's like 90 days sober.  So we're going to bring him in to get a little update.  Oh, did I see him?  The big guy with a red beard?  Yeah.  Oh, is that who that was?  Because he came walking in, and I thought, oh, this is one of your parody guys. 
[02:51:30]  No, no.  Oh, that's cool.  So with that intro, his real name's Daniel, but the internet knows him as Homeless Mustard.  So, Daniel, this is Jackie the Joke Man.  Pleasure, my friend.  Hi.  Very famous stand-up comic.  What's up, man?  I'm Colin.  And Colin came here.  Just walked by me like I'm fucking homeless.  So that just totally looked at me like, yeah, can't help you, dude.  I'm not going to shit on you, honestly.  That bothers you, Colin, that he just walked right by you?  I deserve it.  It's all right.  Yeah.  So. 
[02:52:00]  That's great, man.  This is Daniel.  Hello.  Good morning.  What's up, brother?  It's been a while.  The last time we saw you, you helped us out with our We Are the World parody.  Yeah.  Which, yeah.  Which I thought was kind of funny.  I didn't quite get the joke, I don't think, until later on.  So you guys are making fun of the Haitian Relief remake or whatever, something like that,  right?  Sounds about Mike.  Sounds about Mike.  Sounds about Mike.  All right.  That's the joke.  I wasn't here, but I'm pretty sure.  I was the right age as a kid to really love that song when it was brand new.  Well, I didn't mind the original We Are the World, but when they remade it, it was just 
[02:52:30]  god-awful and went nowhere.  It didn't have the same vibe as the original.  No.  And we decided to mock that, yes, with a bunch of our regulars here on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Yes.  And you were one of them.  But you were like one of the standout singers during the video.  When they start remaking something like that, it's like, we are in show business, we need  some exposure.  Right, right.  We wonder what the intention really was there.  Right.  Get some FaceTime for guys that haven't had FaceTime in a while.  I don't know.  Homeless. 
[02:53:00]  They refuse to explain to me.  They refuse to explain to me why you're called Homeless Mustard.  Is that the first thing you grab for at the shopping spree?  That's funny.  That's what we've done for nine years.  My name is Mustard.  You don't mind me.  No.  Hijacking your show to try and get a fuck.  Fucking answer.  You wouldn't let me tell my joke.  Now I'm going to go right to the source.  You're done.  Radio go.  Go with it.  My name actually is Mustard.  My name is Daniel Mustard.  That's my real name.  Really?  And when I got on here.  Wait, wait.  Like Mustard?  Like the yellow shit you put on hot dogs.  Yes, sir.  Okay.  That's an odd last name. 
[02:53:30]  Wow.  People read that and they want to make it into mustard or they want to make it into something  else.  And I'm like, no, my name is Mustard.  Do you relish your name?  No, that's cute.  All right.  You can take a shot.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Smack me, Colin.  You're doing well.  I smiled.  You're doing well.  Oh, I'm in first grade again.  Question and answer.  Thank you.  You've heard that one a few times, right?  That's why I had to do it.  When he goes hiking, he's always the kid that has to catch up.  I'm not turning around.  I'm not turning around for that.  I'm sorry. 
[02:54:00]  I'm looking straight at it.  Can I go now?  Can I go now?  No, really, growing up, it was a horrible name to have.  I hated that name.  I hated that name.  But it's serving me well now.  So I'm sorry.  Anyway, I got on here because of a cop, because of Keith the cop.  Well, here, you're not getting along with these days.  Oh, damn.  Oh, no.  Whatever.  I wasn't invited to a party of his.  Whatever.  Whatever.  He does what he does.  I ran into him the other night.  And cops have a tendency to refer to you by your last name.  So he came on here calling me Mustard.  I was, at the time, homeless.  And so there you go. 
[02:54:30]  Homeless Mustard.  Homeless Mustard, yeah.  Okay.  And he's very talented.  Plays guitar and sings.  Yeah.  And I was always curious as to how you kept your guitar out on the street.  I didn't.  I don't.  I've been through so many guitars.  When I first came to New York four years ago, I had a $1,000 Takaminei with me.  And I got mugged the first, I don't know, second week I was here or something.  I was gone.  And when I bought that guitar, I remember thinking that would be the only guitar I'd ever have. 
[02:55:00]  And I've been through about 20 guitars since then.  In fact, last April, I think it was, yeah, somebody I met online, James Parrish.  How you doing, man?  He actually gave me a guitar.  I went all the way up to Delaware to get it.  I brought it back to New York.  I had it for about three weeks.  And some graffiti artist named Someone Smashed It, got drunk, and smashed it to bits on the stones of Washington Square Park.  Well, at least you could sleep in the case, right?  Yeah.  But explain to Jackie, because we haven't had you on in a while, why you moved to New York. 
[02:55:30]  You had a whole thing going on.  Well, yeah.  You know, I used to be a normal person, as I like to say.  I used to say that, too.  Yeah, right.  I used to have a nice little normal life.  I had a really pretty wife and a nice cushy job and a groovy little apartment in a cool part of town and a $2,000 dog.  And shit just started falling apart.  And it started with the death of my father.  My father died.  And that really fucked me up.  And some other people died.  And I didn't deal with it well. 
[02:56:00]  And then I lost my nice cushy job.  And I got really depressed.  And I sat in a corner for about a month doing nothing, saying nothing.  And my ex finally was like, I've got to save myself.  I've got to go.  And she left.  And I didn't really know what to do, really.  I started reaching out to friends and never really found out.  Hold on.  There's a few people who need to pull over and buy razor blades.  Really?  Jesus Christ.  That's a horrible story.  I've heard such a worse story.  You know what I mean?  It really happens.  Are you in touch with the ex at all?  No, I haven't talked to her in, like, three years. 
[02:56:30]  I haven't talked to her since.  When did all this go down?  Three years ago?  This is, like, five years ago.  Five years ago?  I haven't talked to her in a long time.  In fact, the only friends that I was still in contact with who were in contact with her  don't talk to her anymore.  And they won't tell me why exactly.  So I don't know.  I don't even know what happened to her.  Do you still have something for her?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  You know, it's funny.  My roommate at this place I'm staying at, Esperanza, it's a halfway house, sober living  house kind of place, he talks to his ex-wife. 
[02:57:00]  And they've been apart for, like, almost 20 years.  And he talks to her every night on the phone.  And he still talks to her, like, that's his wife.  He still relates to this woman like his spouse.  $2.99 a minute.  Sorry.  And, uh...  You just got shit on by a homeless dude.  It's right to your face.  That's all right.  It's great.  At least you knew who I was.  Oh, shit.  Wow. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, shit.  So true.  I'm sorry, Colin.  Wow.  Remind him who he's fucking with, will you?  Yo.  Remind him who he's fucking with.  Jackie, you don't know what I can do, man.  You don't know me.  No, I certainly don't know you from sitting here with you.  Oh, you gotta stop.  Oh, no.  No.  What were we talking about?  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah.  Your romance.  I still have something where I still think of her.  I still miss her and wonder where she is and how she's doing.  Right.  But you came to New York to make it as a musician.  I came to New York because I had nowhere else to go. 
[02:58:00]  But you would hang out and watch it.  Oh, where were you living with your wife?  That was in Los Angeles.  Oh, Los Angeles.  Yeah, that was in L.A., where I was trying to be an actor.  And when I...  I came to New York because at the time I had a sister who was living here.  And she basically said I could come stay at her house because she wasn't going to be there.  And it was just...  Her and her kids were in Florida at the time.  She's like, all right, you can come and stay at my house for a little while, I guess.  She wasn't really all that interested in helping me, to be honest. 
[02:58:30]  But she did what she could.  And for a while I was living with her investment banker husband.  She married up, as they say.  And that was a trip, just me and him staring at each other across the breakfast table going,  what the fuck are you?  Having nothing in common.  No idea how to talk to each other.  So anyway, so whatever, I found a...  I started working at Tower Records.  Second day I was in New York, I walked into Tower.  I started talking to this woman, and she's like...  She marched me back.  She's like, do you need a job?  And I was like, yeah, I guess I do. 
[02:59:00]  And I worked there until they shut that place down.  I actually cried the day they closed the doors.  And then I kind of bummed around for a little bit, just staying with people.  I crashed in a friend's basement for a while.  Spent a winter in a basement in Brooklyn with Jeremy Kivitt.  But obviously it just kept getting worse for you.  It's gradual than sudden.  Oh, it's more of a gradual thing.  What was your job before all hell broke loose? 
[02:59:30]  Well, when I was in L.A., the last long-term job I had, I worked for a vitamin distribution company.  I sold vitamins over the phone.  I made a lot of money doing that.  But that wasn't your dream.  You wanted to be an actor or a musician, obviously.  Okay.  So now you're down to a basement in Brooklyn.  Yeah, basement in Brooklyn.  Anyway, eventually he finally got to the point where he was like, you know what?  You've got to find something else to do.  And I stayed with a friend in Flatbush, Kristen, for a little while.  And then I ended up at the shelter.  There's a big intake shelter on 30th Street and 1st Avenue. 
[03:00:00]  And I was there for like two months or something.  And I got in an argument with a cafeteria lady one night.  And so they – because she thought I'd already gone through the line.  But I hadn't.  See, there are more people that look like Willie Nelson.  That joke could be real.  No, the reason she got confused is at the time –  Even if you went through the line, who gives a shit?  Well, really?  No, no.  This woman acted like it was her food.  Of course.  The personal fence or something. 
[03:00:30]  The power trip people out there.  They should all die.  No, she – I was – at the time, there was a friend of mine that was hanging out with  who had broken his arm.  And his arm was up in a – however you want to describe that on the radio.  And so every time we'd come through the line, I would help him and carry his tray.  And so one morning, I just wasn't with him.  And he'd already gone through the line.  So she remembered seeing him and thought that I had gone – that I was with him.  So it was this big thing.  So they sent me off to this place in Kings County.  You're kicked out because of that.  Right.  Let me just jump in here and say, if I'm a homeless person, I think the last person 
[03:01:00]  that I would want to have a fight with would be –  Is the cafeteria lady.  Is the cafeteria lady.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to talk to the food.  You know, whatever you can do to keep that relationship afloat, right?  All right.  Good point.  I'm sorry.  Thank God Jackie's here today.  The logic.  So they kicked you out for that nonsense.  Well, they sent me to this place on the back end of Brooklyn that was for middle-aged ex-con  junkies.  And I am none of the above.  And that place really freaked me out. 
[03:01:30]  So I had been hanging out with some people in Washington Square Park, musicians, and one  of them, a guy named Joel Young, he said, fuck this shit, man.  Come on out here and just hang out in the park.  And so I did.  And that's how I ended up, like, officially, like, on the streets.  Living on the streets.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And it was all gradual, as you pointed out.  Yeah, gradual and a sudden.  Unbelievable.  You sound good now, man, the way you're talking.  You sound good.  Yeah, I'm doing all right.  Sobriety is treating me well.  It's kind of a trip.  Now I'm here in three months sober.  93 days. 
[03:02:00]  Congratulations.  Now what –  Thank you.  That's the longest I've been sober in, like, a decade.  But what – why this time?  Why this time?  Why did you decide 93 days ago?  Did you have an incident?  Well, no.  It's one of those things you kind of think of.  You know, for the last two years I've been thinking of this myself.  I need to do something.  I need to get myself out of the streets.  I need to move on.  I need to get on with myself.  I've been playing a lot.  And then this happened.  Coming on this show was a big deal.  And the whole, like, you know, you guys offered to, you know, make a recording. 
[03:02:30]  And then I came up that one time and I was drunk.  It was a disaster.  Let's be honest.  I had to let you go for a while there, mustard.  But we're more than willing to give it another shot.  And everybody was very disappointed in me, yes.  And one night I was –  Yeah, Jackie, I got involved with this.  I told him I would, you know, get an album out for him.  And he came in and –  Oof.  Blew it?  Oof.  He blew it?  It was one of those –  He was kind of like –  I know the bug's buddy frog.  It's one of those –  It doesn't perform when it's time to perform.  It was a mess.  Moss, you know it was a mess.  It was a mess.  But we're going to give it another shot.  You know, it's funny. 
[03:03:00]  It's one of those things when you drink like that, when you're drunk like that, you don't realize how drunk you are.  And it wasn't until I heard the recording afterwards, like a week later, that I realized, oh, my God, what the fuck?  When I heard that, I literally almost cried.  It was in the car.  I was like, what the fuck is this?  Right.  And that was a big deal.  That was a big moment of like, you know, really, I got to get my shit together.  And then one night I'm, you know, sleeping on the vent at NYU and a friend of mine starts kicking me.  And he kicks me awake and screaming at me how pathetic I am.  And telling me I got to do something. 
[03:03:30]  I got to, you know, I got to get –  I was doing something.  I was sleeping, you fuck.  I was having a nice little dream here.  And so, you know, I went to rehab.  I went to the Addiction Institute in Roosevelt Hospital, which is not far from here.  And that went well.  And now, you know, I'm staying at this place up on 107th called Esperanza.  Right.  And I'm going to meetings and stuff.  I go to –  Is it rough? 
[03:04:00]  What?  Staying off the sauce.  They say it's harder to get sober than it is to stay sober.  No, it's harder to stay sober.  Getting sober is easy.  No, I heard the opposite.  No, I don't know about that.  But, no, no, no.  Getting sober is easy.  You know, getting – you know, that's detox or rehab.  You know, you're in a hospital for 28 days.  You don't really have an option.  No matter how much you want to drink.  It's when they say, you know, beat it.  The hard part is when –  Going back to life.  Well, the hard part is going back – exactly.  Going back to life.  Going back to the real world.  And even right now, I have the convenience of being in this facility where they, you know, they piss test you every week. 
[03:04:30]  And it's like, you know, if you fuck that up, they kick you out.  So, like, even now, it's like even if I want to have a drink, I have that to, like, you know, encourage you.  So you're still not integrated back into the real life yet.  You've still got checks and balances.  That's the real test.  The real test.  But how long are you allowed to stay where you're at?  Where they're checking on you a little bit.  The idea is that they try to get you housings.  Oh, shit.  That's coming soon, I would assume, huh?  You know, five to eight months kind of thing. 
[03:05:00]  Okay.  So I've been there about two months now.  And it's all right.  You know, it's all right.  It's a little odd.  It's kind of a strange environment.  80 men trapped in a house and find out what happens when you stop being polite.  It would make an interesting reality show.  And, you know, most of the guys in there are, like, ex-cons or on mandations or dealers or stuff like that.  So it's like...  That's nice.  Prison light.  Yeah.  That's funny.  That's fantastic.  Sleeping with one eye open or what? 
[03:05:30]  Well, no.  You know, they're all right.  They're pretty nice to me.  I'm kind of an anomaly there because I'm one of only three white guys in the whole facility.  Oh, that's cool.  So they all kind of look at me like, what the fuck?  Holy shit.  And then with the music and stuff.  You must really want to get sober.  Sounds like a nightmare.  Once I started bringing the guitar up.  I think that will sober you up.  Yeah, right.  People really are nicer to you when you carry a guitar around.  So that's been all right.  Right on.  Well, we brought Mustard in because I got word that you're playing your first gig. 
[03:06:00]  I'm playing, yeah, Mustard, live and sober.  Um, that's, uh, this Saturday at 830 at a place called The Groove, which is on McDougal  and West 3rd.  Um, I'm also playing again at, uh, Cafe Wa on August 27th.  No shit.  With a band.  Cafe Wa is world fucking famous, man.  That's the top of the food chain.  That should be, you know, it's going to be over here.  Did you know Lady Gaga or am I?  I knew Lady Gaga.  This guy knew Lady Gaga.  Stephanie, as we called her, yeah.  Uh, this is like, uh, at least three years ago, maybe longer. 
[03:06:30]  There was a friend of mine, Paul Alves, who, um, is my, one of my only, a few sober friends,  but at the time he was not and used to organize this songwriting, songwriter showcase called  Songwriters from Hell.  And the first gig I booked in New York City, yeah, like four years ago was, was this show  and, um, was the Songwriters from Hell.  The second one, I actually played three of them.  And the second one and the third one, I'm not sure which one I played, Lady Gaga was  the headliner.  Jesus.  And, um.  Maybe she could help you out.  She was pretty badass back then. 
[03:07:00]  You don't need me.  You got Lady Gaga.  I don't got her number.  All right.  So tomorrow night, that's cool.  Mustard Place for the first time.  I mean, I think a bunch of our listeners will go check it out if they're local.  That would be cool.  If they're not local, they're going to see fucking Jackie down in Atlantic City.  Trump Arena.  Maybe you guys should fucking do a show together, Jackie.  Let's combine the plugs here.  He's auditioning right now.  You know, it's so funny.  When he was talking, one of the things he said sounded like a band.  Middle-aged ex-con junkies.  Doesn't that sound like a band? 
[03:07:30]  It should open up for you to have the middle-aged ex-con junkies.  Middle-aged ex-con junkies.  Now, I want to call my band Fall Risk.  When I go to detox, I often get a band because I'm a Fall Risk.  When I have a tendency to fall down, you get this bright-colored band that says Fall Risk.  Fall Risk.  You're a Fall Risk?  I don't even want to know there's such a thing as a Fall Risk.  I know.  I thought that was called The Weekend.  Yeah, right.  Going back to college.  You want to play something today?  Yeah, sure.  Daniel?  Daniel Mustard?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sort of homeless Mustard? 
[03:08:00]  I've got to get rid of this homeless thing.  This is where he opens up the cases.  Who took my guitar, man?  Yeah, right.  Well, it was here yesterday.  Well, you know, people can be complete assholes.  So he plays this version of Creep for us, and it was amazing.  It really became an internet sensation.  And everyone's pointing out the guitar he's playing.  Like, sure, he's homeless.  He's got a $2,000 guitar.  How could he be homeless?  But not thinking that, obviously, where we work, we would have guitars laying out.  I wrote a new song.  There's a lyric in there.  I don't know this guitar. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, really?  Are you playing your own guitar today?  No, this is actually a loaner I've been playing.  It's Rich Brownstein who booked this gig for me at The Groove.  He lent me this guitar.  Oh, very nice.  Don't lose it.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  So you want to play something now?  Yeah, sure.  Well, give me a second.  While he gets it out, I will kiss some ass, and we're going to dedicate this song to Steve  Getka, who booked me at the Trump Marina at the show.  He's a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  I met him, and he really is a fan.  And he really is a nice guy.  And John Starbuck, my manager, who's out there saying, this is so great that Jackie's on the 
[03:09:00]  show.  And now he's not only on this show, but he's getting to see Homeless Mustard play.  Yes.  Where else is that going to happen?  You know, he walked in.  He couldn't have looked more normal.  He looks very different.  You know what I mean?  I mean, you know.  We'll tweet some pictures and videos for everybody later.  But Mustard, you said you gained a bunch of weight because you're not drinking?  Yeah.  I'm off the all-vodka diet, so I've put on about 55 pounds this last time you saw me.  I can speak from, when you stop drinking, it's like one of the pennies is, my God, food, 
[03:09:30]  this is great stuff.  Does food start tasting better?  Wow.  Man.  It starts to taste, period.  It should be hard to keep the guitar tuned outside.  Oh, I thought that was the song.  Can you imagine?  It's a stomach.  Oh, jeez.  Hey, the Grateful Dead made a living out of this.  What the hell?  All the talent was in the booze. 
[03:10:00]  What do you mean made?  That's right.  Grateful Dead.  They continue to make a living, even though half the members are dead.  That's just amazing to me.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, they're still out there touring.  I know some kid that's following around the country.  All right.  He's got the mic.  His guitar is...  No pressure, Mustard.  Just fucking ready to go.  Just go with it.  I do believe.  Thank you.  All right.  What are you going to play for us today, sir? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, shouldn't it just be a surprise?  Okay.  That sounds good.  I think he meant he forgot.  Okay.  Oof.  I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind. 
[03:11:00]  There's something so pleasant about that place.  Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.  And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch. 
[03:11:30]  It wasn't because I didn't know enough.  I knew so much.  I knew so much.  Does that make me crazy?  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  Does that make me crazy?  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  I'm thinking I'm crazy. 
[03:12:00]  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  I'm thinking I'm crazy.  And I hope that you are having the time of your life  But think twice  That's my only advice 
[03:12:30]  How do you, how do you, how do you  How do you think you are  Bless your soul  You think you're in control  Well, I think you're crazy  I think you're crazy 
[03:13:00]  I'm thinking you're crazy  Crazy, crazy  Just like me  And my heroes have the heart to lose  That lies out on the land  Oh, all I remember  Was thinking 
[03:13:30]  I want to be like them  Ever since I was little  I was little  It looked like fun  And it's no coincidence  I've come  And I can die when I'm done  Does that make me crazy? 
[03:14:00]  I'm thinking I'm crazy  I must be crazy  Crazy, crazy  Naturally  Oh yeah, I'm crazy  I know you're crazy 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, we're all crazy  Crazy, crazy  I'm past the place  Oh yeah  Mr. Mustard  That was great, man  Very good  Can I tell a little story here?  I recently found myself 
[03:15:00]  Folk singer tells stories afterwards and everything  Oh my goodness  I recently found myself sober in a psych ward  It's a line from a girl in an AA meeting  Said that the other day  And it made me laugh  Because I myself found myself sober in a psych ward  You go to these meetings  And one of the things people often talk about  Is how we're crazy  Addicts, people who have these problems  I tend to be a little crazy  Beyond their addiction to whatever substance they're using  And so yeah  When I was drinking heavy  When I was living on the streets 
[03:15:30]  It wasn't uncommon  It wasn't completely common  It wasn't uncommon for me to find myself in a psych ward  It's easier  It's better than going to jail  I heard you're a biter  I've heard that too  I don't know  I have no recollection of these things  But I've been told  I hear from certain law officers  That he's a biter  What does that mean?  If they try to bring him in  He will start biting people  Well, that's not exactly true  No, that's not exactly true  Wait, wait, wait  The biting thing  The biting thing comes from one night 
[03:16:00]  I was taking a piss  By the bathroom in the park  And the bathroom was closed  So I was sort of just pissing by the bathroom  At least you were close to it  Yeah  Yeah, right  I was, you know  Gave it a try  Not completely off the mark  And some cop tried to, like  Came up behind me  And tried to handcuff me  Without identifying himself  Or saying anything  Or warning me  I mean, basically  He tried to catch you  With my dick out of my pants  And, um  You had your hands full  He claimed that I bit him 
[03:16:30]  It's a lie  There were witnesses  There's people that, you know  Can contest that that is not true  He totally made that up  To justify throwing me on the floor  And roughing me up  The way that he did  And that whole thing was thrown out  It's not a big deal  But the biting thing  Really comes from some bullshit  Chump thing  But I gotta say  The cops at 6th Precinct  Have been very cool to me lately  They're very proud of me  For getting sober  They're so used to dealing  With this big drunken asshole  That they love seeing me  Not, you know, fucked up  And they're very cool about it  6th Precinct, yeah  Cool, definitely  Um  Anyway, so I was joking 
[03:17:00]  That I should do a whole song  Of, a whole record  Of cover songs  Called Crazy  You know, just Seals Crazy  Oh, yeah  Patsy Cline  Crazy song  Yeah  A lot of crazy songs out there  Crazy for you  Crazy on you  I'm a girl biter  Crazy train  Crazy train  I'm a girl biter  And then I went  And wrote a song  Wrote my own song  Called Crazy  Let's go crazy  Crazy  Let's go crazy  Yeah, there you go  Yeah  Well, fuck, man  And what are you doing  For money these days?  Oh, I can't say the whore word, right? 
[03:17:30]  I think you can  You realize the show  Has come full circle, right?  Yeah  You know who wrote Crazy  Willie Nelson  Very good  I'm still here  I'm still here  What's up, buddy?  I'm still here  Colin Cain, everyone  Comics  August 12th and August 20th  That's right  That's Colin Cain  Comics  Very funny comic  By the way, Colin Cain  So, fuck, mustard  Sounds like you got  Your shit together for now  I hope you continue  Down this road, man  Yeah, go out and celebrate 
[03:18:00]  There we go  That's always good  You buying?  Yeah  Oh, man  Just knock him off the wagon  You know, I quit drinking  Sanko de Mayo, 2001  And I just did it on my own  But I went with a guy  To an AA meeting  My God  Like, I never saw people consume  More cigarettes or coffee  Oh, really?  And coffee around  It was like, wow  You know, you guys just go  There's a lot of cross addiction  My God  Where people just pick up 
[03:18:30]  Something else instead  Anything, right  Yeah, and the coffee and cigarettes  Is a big one  But now even cigarettes are out  People aren't even smoking anymore  Especially in the city  Well, it's what?  $14, $15 a pack  Yeah, it's ridiculous  I'll stick to booze  Right, booze is so much cheaper  Listen, I'm being critical  Meanwhile, it's my fourth cup of coffee  And it's only 6 o'clock in the morning  Right, well  Daniel, where's the gig tomorrow night again?  It's called The Groove  It's on West 3rd and McDougal  Okay  In the village  You're playing a whole set? 
[03:19:00]  Yes, sir  Are there people playing?  No, it's just going to be me this week  Tomorrow  The show on August 27th  Cafe Wall will be with a full band  With a whole band  Are you practicing with the band?  Well, half of them are out of town right now  But as soon as they get back  We'll be practicing  Do you play and sing with the full band?  Or do you just handle the vocals?  I hope and do not have to play  I'm not really much of a guitar player  To be honest  But whatever  Whatever we figure out  I'll do  Right, okay  We're getting close to wrapping up  But I want to get that intern in here again real fast 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, bring that  I forgot his name already  Oscar  Oscar  How new is he?
