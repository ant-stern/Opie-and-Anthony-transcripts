<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment focusing on their intern, Lady Di, who was extremely late due to a series of unfortunate events involving a diarrheal episode, a malfunctioning automated sink in a train station bathroom (resulting in a wet coat), and a problematic cab ride.  The hosts relentlessly joked about the graphic details of her intestinal distress.  Lady Di also recounted a less-than-pleasant experience at TGI Fridays, involving unwanted physical contact from a man at the bar, and a night out with a friend named Bobo. The conversation then veered to the disappearance of Malaysian Flight 370, with the hosts speculating on various causes, from pilot suicide to mechanical failure and even alien abduction.  They briefly touched upon the controversy surrounding Dr. Drew's comments about porn star Bella Knox.  The segment ended with the hosts' bizarre proposition to pay Lady Di extra for recording her next bowel movement and offering her breakfast.

The show continued with discussions of various unrelated topics.  First, there was a discussion about crowdsourced efforts to locate the missing airplane wreckage, followed by speculation about the plane's disappearance, including theories involving pilot involvement and intentional decompression. Next, they discussed a viral video of a child crying over a Carolina Panthers player trade, contrasting it with their own children’s reactions and the absurdity of exploiting children's emotions for viral fame.  This was followed by a humorous discussion of a news story about a comedian returning to his Airbnb to find it occupied by participants in an overweight orgy.

The show then featured an interview with Bella Knox, a Duke University student and adult film actress.  The interview covered a wide range of topics including her experiences in the adult film industry, her family and friends' reactions (including a tutor who broke a pinky swear and spread information about her work), the challenges faced by sex workers, and the stigma surrounding the profession.  Knox described a particularly graphic scene involving rough face-fucking, revealing that past self-harm was used to enhance its emotional impact. She also discussed pay disparity between male and female performers, her preferences for rough sex and BDSM, and negative interactions with media personalities like Sherri Shepherd and Dr. Drew.  The interview touched upon the ethical and legal challenges of the industry, including mandatory condom usage laws.  Bob Levy called in briefly, adding sexually explicit comments. Lady Di was present in the studio, contributing questions and off-color remarks throughout.

A subsequent segment revisited the interview with Bella Knox, this time including more graphic details about her experiences, including a threesome with Ron Jeremy.  The conversation focused heavily on explicit descriptions of various sexual acts and preferences.  Lady Di's contributions were frequently outrageous and sexually explicit, focusing on her own sexual history and bodily functions, which included frequent mentions of diarrhea and vomiting throughout the broadcast.  The hosts also inquired about Knox's earnings and her fascination with the Amanda Knox case.  A notable phone call from Donald Rumsfeld occurred, where the hosts initially asked him about the lizard person conspiracy theory before shifting to a discussion of the Middle East.  The segment concluded with a bizarre attempt by the hosts to buy Lady Di's underwear, culminating in them acquiring it.

The final segment revolved around a bag of Lady Di's soiled underwear.  The hosts, along with E-Rock and Sam, attempted to get E-Rock to smell the underwear; he refused.  They then engaged in a detailed and crude discussion about the contents of the bag, describing the stains and smells of urine and feces.  They further discussed Lady Di's apparent health issues, including vomiting, incontinence, and possible alcohol-related problems.  Eventually, the hosts and Sam examined the underwear, commenting on the soiling.  Listener phone calls added to the discussion, with one caller suggesting trichotillomania.  A brief mention of a celebrity encounter with Valerie Bertinelli was included. The segment ended with continued concern for Lady Di's well-being.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And we're off. Good morning, everyone.  Hi there.  The first phone call.  Did the water buffalo make it into work today?  Oh, boy.  A lot of people wondering if Lady Di made it to work today.  I was reading a lot of tweets last night.  Yeah.  And a lot of people, yeah, do you think she'll make it in tomorrow?  Right.  One and done.  She's our first paid intern.  Yeah.  Why is Sam crying already? What happened?  Just walking up the hall.  Yeah.  She is here.  Okay.  She wasn't. She's late. 
[00:00:30]  She just got here.  Oh, Christ.  Her sweater's wet.  Right.  Just ask her when you talk to her, ask her why her sweater's wet.  Yeah. I mean, because it's not raining out.  Just ask her.  Is that why you're crying?  Yes.  All right.  All right. Bring her in. Let's find out why.  Bring in our paid intern.  Our paid intern is late on day two.  Look, she's shaped like some type of tropical fruit.  The W.C. Fields picture that was going on last night on Twitter.  Yeah.  It's the same person.  Okay.  Hi, Lady Di. 
[00:01:00]  Why are you late?  What happened?  You all right?  We're worried about you.  My God.  Well, sit down.  Please, please.  It's early.  It's early at night.  Oh, wow.  She's grumpy.  Please.  Come on, Jimmy.  Please.  I am.  I'm happy.  What's the matter?  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  We just want you to sit down because we're very nervous about your health.  She's getting all cranky with Jimmy.  You got white stuff in the corner of your mouth.  Hold on.  No, I don't.  You got white stuff in the corner of your mouth.  Well, your glasses are really crooked today.  Why are they so crooked today?  Maybe I slept in them.  I have no idea.  Maybe you slept with your glasses and your eyes are tearing pretty badly. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  And you're late for your job.  I'm late because of the cab driver in Elizabeth.  That's the reason why I'm late.  He got there.  You know, he said he was going to be there in five minutes.  Yeah.  Right?  Okay.  Okay.  And then he got there, and I wasn't out there yet.  So he left.  Why weren't you out there?  And I called them back.  Oh, why weren't you out there?  I called them back, the dispatcher, whatever. 
[00:02:00]  I said, send them back.  I'm outside now.  And then after that, he just...  So wouldn't that be your fault?  It sounds like the cab showed up.  He was there.  The cab showed up.  I wasn't outside.  Right.  Why weren't you outside?  All right.  But why weren't you outside?  He should have stayed there for a minute.  I was putting on my sneakers.  So the guy said he's not sending them back.  Yeah.  So I walked to the train station.  All right.  How long have a walk?  Huh?  How long have a walk?  I don't know, about six blocks or so.  And why is your... 
[00:02:30]  I see that your shirt is all wet on your side.  It'll dry.  You know what happened?  What happened?  All right.  When I went to the bathroom...  I got the...  You were on his shirt?  I got the runs today.  It's...  It's bad.  I got the runs today.  I went to the bathroom.  I went to the bathroom.  Well, I'm running as nice and bad as possible.  And we're off and running.  All right.  Poor lady Dian has the runs.  Oh, no.  And I put my coat... 
[00:03:00]  Oh, my God.  Will you let us laugh?  Will you let us laugh?  Will you let us laugh?  Or goddamn...  Will you be quiet for a second?  I still want to laugh about you.  So you had the runs.  So you had the runs.  All right.  We're back to you had the runs.  What do you mean you had the runs?  Is that like...  No.  Poop?  What?  This?  No, no, no.  It's just wet.  Everything's wet.  So how did it get wet?  Yeah.  How did your shirt get wet?  All right.  Well, we were talking.  We were laughing.  We were laughing.  All right.  I put the shirt, you know, on the sink, thinking the sink was not automated. 
[00:03:30]  So the sink got my coat wet.  Wait.  Why did you put your shirt on the sink?  My coat.  Oh, you said shirt.  And then I put my coat on because it was cold out.  Oh, and it was all wet.  Wait.  What is an automated sink?  I guess so when you put your hands in front, the water comes out.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know it was an automated sink.  So you put your jacket here and just got wet.  And I put my jacket on.  Where?  At the train station?  At the train station, yeah.  You went to take a dump at the train station? 
[00:04:00]  You know, yeah, well, it came on all of a sudden.  But why would you take...  It came on.  Wait.  Well, doesn't that happen?  It comes on all of a sudden.  You're like, uh-oh.  Oh, God.  A little loosey-goosey.  Wait.  You got the runs at...  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  This is too good.  You should put your headphones on so you can hear us.  Yes, please.  So you don't know what we're talking.  Are you talking?  Did you leave the house fine?  Yeah.  And dry?  Right.  Well, no.  All right.  I started to have the runs at home.  And then I thought it was over with. 
[00:04:30]  And then all of a sudden at the train station, I had them again.  It started percolating again.  I'm not listening again.  Hold on.  Will you let us laugh?  Yeah, I know.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, you got to just...  See, you went to train station to drop a liquidy deuce.  So if I have to take a bathroom break, I will let Sam know.  Now, Lady Di, let me ask you this.  What do you think it was from last night or something that gave you the runs?  The trots.  Well, of course it's beer.  Come on.  Too much beer? 
[00:05:00]  What could it possibly be?  Oh, she's cranky today.  I'm not cranky.  You're a little cranky.  You're a little cranky.  You should know that.  But it was beer that gave you.  Was it?  Or maybe it was the coffee.  You know, because sometimes coffee does that to you.  That's true.  That's true.  I thought maybe you had some Mexican or something.  Right.  Well, no.  No.  Dunkin' Donuts.  Well, your coffee's not Dunkin' Donuts.  No.  The coffee colada at Dunkin' Donuts, every time I have that, a half hour later, I have  to run to the bathroom.  So stop drinking it.  You'll be having one today. 
[00:05:30]  Coffee colada.  What do you think I'm going to come on?  Let's get her a coffee colada.  No, don't do that.  They're delicious.  Yeah, I think we all want coffee coladas.  Coffee coladas.  Who wants to do a little bedding today?  Yeah.  I love a good coffee colada.  Then we'll go to the, we'll see who runs to the bathroom first.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, now I'm still dehydrated.  I say she gets the runs.  Oh, boy.  I say she gets the runs before 730.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's going to have to go.  Wait, so you had the runs at home.  And then I came.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, because I was laughing, so I want all the facts. 
[00:06:00]  But you weren't wet yet at home.  I wasn't wet yet.  No, I mean your shirt and all that.  No, I wasn't wet yet.  No.  Okay.  And then you went to the train station.  And then.  And then you put your stuff.  Why would you take your shirt off and everything to go to the bathroom?  I did not take my shirt off.  I took my jacket off.  Why is your sleeve wet?  I took my jacket off and then it was cold outside.  I was going to leave it off until it dried.  It was too cold outside, so I put it right back on again.  I only got the sleeves wet.  From what?  The coat?  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  From the coat being wet?  That means it was really wet.  Yes.  The coat being really wet.  Well, that means I was in the bathroom a really long time.  Things just fucking, the faucets running like she was.  Liquid.  She soaked on her whole left side.  Yes.  And she's saying that's from the wet coat.  Yeah.  So why would you put the coat back on again?  Oh, you're going to catch your death.  Oh, it was cold out, too.  Well, yeah.  I went outside with just my sweater on and holding them.  Oh, my God.  But then I said, no.  I said, I better put the coat on.  You should have been outside for the cab, quite frankly. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, that was kind of a mistake.  How many times did you have the run so far this morning?  Twice.  Twice so far?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Do you feel like another one coming on?  A little raw?  Believe me, I won't let somebody know if another one comes on.  It's just one of those things, you know?  It happens.  It happens to all of us.  We all get it.  We all get it.  We all get it.  Don't you worry about it.  Oh, my God.  What a great start.  Moving on.  Next subject.  Day two of Lady Di's paid internship.  Yes. 
[00:07:30]  Internship.  Oh, my God.  You don't disappoint.  Everything else is okay?  Right now.  That's because you dehydrated from all that.  I'm just not.  Yeah.  Is the coffee colada coming, Sam?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Because all that fluid just went right out through your anus in the train station.  Fluid.  It's diarrhea.  It's as nice about it as possible.  That's all right.  We're friends.  You can talk to us.  Were you tired from working for the first time in 15 years yesterday?  I went home, and then I had to run out for Bill.  Mm-hmm.  Why?  For Bill?  What did Bill want?  Bill did nothing but lax and lax and lax around all day. 
[00:08:00]  I had to run out for him.  He was mucking around.  Okay?  What did you have to do for him?  And I said, Bill, I just got back from New York.  Now you're sending me out on a beer run?  Oh.  This is what's going on with you.  This Bill guy doesn't take care of him.  Yeah, what a cheapskate.  I think Bill is an enabler.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, I guess you'd call him an enabler, but I didn't feel like running out for beer.  No, huh?  So what happened was...  But it sounds like you went out anyway.  Oh, okay.  I had the neighbor.  Yeah.  The neighbor was over. 
[00:08:30]  Uh-huh.  All right, take me to get the beer.  I said, I don't feel like driving right now.  Oh, no.  I got back from TGIF, right?  What?  I got back from TGI Fridays in Penn Station.  What?  What did you do there?  Bobo and I were hanging out for a little while.  Who?  Bobo.  Oh.  We were hanging out.  Oh, by the way, he left his...  Oh.  Brains?  He told me to grab his hoodie the next time or something like that or he's going to come  So you were hanging out with Bobo at TGI Fridays.  Wow. 
[00:09:00]  Breaking news.  You can hang out with your friends.  Now, why didn't I read this on Twitter?  What does it matter?  A little secret?  You can hang out with your friends.  Is he the father of your baby?  I am not pregnant.  Oh.  Is that what happened?  If I am pregnant, it's immaculate conception.  Uh-huh.  Is that what happened with Bobo with the diarrhea now?  Maybe Bobo loosened a little bit while he was in there.  Oh, shit.  Come on, Dice.  Oh, no.  Was he in there?  Yeah.  He didn't do anything sexual.  Maybe your TGI Fridays food gave you the duties, by the way.  What?  What did you eat at TGI Fridays? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, maybe you were...  I didn't even feel like eating.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  I could have had some corned beef when I got home.  Oh, boy.  But I did not...  No, really.  I wasn't hungry.  Corned beef and cabbage.  I was just more tired than I was hungry.  I hear you.  All right.  So what did you eat at TGI Fridays?  I didn't eat anything.  Nothing?  Okay.  I just had beer.  You had some beer?  What about Bobo?  What did he do?  Your eyebrows are pinchers in.  He had a couple beers.  Yeah, you had a couple beers?  Yeah.  And then he left, and I stayed there.  Who paid for it?  Well, we were taking turns paying. 
[00:10:00]  Uh-huh.  All right.  And you stayed for more beer?  Yeah, because another guy was treating me to beer, too.  Who was that?  Who was that?  I don't know.  Some other guy.  I don't know.  So Bobo got...  He sure made himself known to me.  That's for sure.  Bobo got aged out.  To me, I don't know why.  Did Bobo feel like...  What?  Like he was being moved in on?  Bobo wasn't there.  No, so why did Daniel leave?  Bobo, why did he leave?  Well, he left because he had to go meet a friend or something. 
[00:10:30]  Uh-huh.  Now, you've got to explain something to me.  What?  Paint the picture for me.  You're sitting at the bar at TGI Friday's.  Right.  And now, let me know, how does this guy approach you?  What happened?  He just came right up to me.  He came right up to you.  After Bobo left, he said he knows Bobo.  I said, oh, that's nice.  Okay, all right, hold on, hold on.  So he's a fan of the show.  I would assume so.  Fan of the show.  Comes up to you.  I told him I just came from the radio station.  He goes, which one?  I said, Opie and Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Right?  And then he said, oh, I don't know them. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, so he knows Bobo, though.  He just knows Bobo from the bar.  From the bar.  And then he decided he was going to hang out with you.  Slip in and talk to Bobo's chick.  Uh-huh.  You can say that if you want.  Was he looking for some action?  He was looking for some action, but I didn't give it to him, obviously.  Why not?  And then I said, you know, I just met you.  I said, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  I don't mind the drinks, but.  What did he do to make you say that?  Yeah, what was he saying?  He was standing right by me, and he goes, oh, this is on me.  This is on me.  This is on me. 
[00:11:30]  I just retired, so this is on me.  Uh-huh.  And then what happened?  And then he left.  But did he ask you to.  Okay, then he came back, but then he went after some other girl.  No, no, but you said, hold on, hold on.  Guys are this desperate?  I don't know.  Wait, he tried to hit on you.  How did he try?  Yes, he tried to hit on you.  How?  Did he put himself against you?  Come on, tell me.  What did he do?  Yeah.  I said, what are you doing?  What was he doing?  He put his penis on you?  Oh, it was some part of the body.  Yeah, was he getting a little close, right?  I was sitting at the bar, and he was like right there, and he was like, hey, you know. 
[00:12:00]  He's pressing up against you?  He's pressing his penis on you.  Yeah, he's pressing up against me.  Anytime women bitch about anything, you could all go fuck yourselves.  Let me tell you something.  Because if you're a guy, and you just go into a bar, and no girl, no matter what, is going  to come up and start rubbing her fucking pussy on you to get laid.  No.  The girls have it a lot easier.  Girls don't do that, but.  No shit.  Some of the guys out there, yeah.  But you could sit in a bar, and some guy's going to come over and want to fuck you.  This is crazy. 
[00:12:30]  And push his penis up against you?  He's trying to be a lady and have a drink.  I would assume he was doing a little grinding, and I'm like, what are you doing?  Oh, my God.  What was that about?  I said, I just met you.  I said, I can't.  So we exchanged phone numbers.  Oh, you did?  No.  We should give him a call.  So you said, what are you?  No, he should give me a call.  Whoa.  You might be listening right now.  I should give him a call.  He should give me a call.  You have his phone number?  But this guy is like, he just turned 62.  You have his phone number?  For some reason.  Did he have his dog with him? 
[00:13:00]  And you look 62, so it's perfect.  Older men.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  I attract older men.  Yes.  Oh, look at that.  I can't attract somebody like you.  20, Anthony.  I don't attract somebody in their 60s.  Well, then you can.  I don't understand that.  It's good to know you still have it, right?  You know what?  You know what?  You're talking about the headphones on.  I can't hear a thing.  Well, turn the volume up.  No, it doesn't matter if they're on or on.  Sam, Sam, put the headphones on.  I'm going to see.  All right.  Now I can hear.  You never turned up the volume?  I don't know what to tell you. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  Where's the volume at over here?  At the end of the cord.  Follow the cord.  And you'll find a volume switch.  And you'll find a volume switch.  The poor dear.  She wants to be a lady and have a beer at the Penn Station TGI Friday.  Oh, Penn Station TGI.  A Penn Station TGI.  How much are they for a beer?  Seven dollars.  Seven dollars.  Oh, boy.  How much did you have?  And they really, you know, yesterday there was a lot of people there, too, because of  St. Patrick's Day.  That's why, yeah.  There was a lot of people.  How many beers did you have?  Seven dollars.  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I just went over this with Bill.  I think I had about four or five of my own beers. 
[00:14:00]  Why did you go over it with Bill?  Huh?  Why did you go over it with Bill?  It's his money.  Oh, boy.  He wants to know where the money went.  He wants an assessment.  Cheapskate wants to know where the money went.  That's why he doesn't take me.  I would have been on time if he were to get in the truck and take me to the train station.  He's so lazy.  That guy at the bar was wearing beer welding shield.  Right.  He was up, too.  Not even goggles.  He had a beer welding shield on.  I gave up on him a long time ago.  Trust me.  Yeah, he's lazy, this guy.  And he's cheap.  Bill's a fucking asshole. 
[00:14:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  He's not that bad.  Yes, yes, yes.  He's making you go out and get beer after he's using you.  He's not that bad.  He just doesn't want me to spend all the money in one place, which makes sense.  No, it doesn't.  It's a bar place.  He doesn't want me to do that.  I don't understand this relationship you have.  I don't either.  You're just roommates?  Yeah, we're just roommates.  He sleeps in one room and I sleep in one of the other.  You play once in a while on the couch.  You do a little bit.  No, no, no.  We don't do anything.  But he takes care of you.  A little bit.  It's really strange.  He takes care of me financially, but he doesn't like it when I spend too much money. 
[00:15:00]  Gotcha.  All right.  Listen.  Go ahead.  Look at Sam.  Look at Sam.  He knows.  That's how Bill does.  You're wiping everything off your face, all right?  She had a little crud on her mouth.  You're tired, huh?  She's tired.  Hey, did you get that guy's number last night?  Who?  Yeah.  You did?  Uh-huh.  We should probably give him a call at some point.  No, don't.  No, no, no, no.  Don't do that.  Because he's drunk.  He probably forgot.  He probably has 10 girls.  No, I think he forgot.  So that's why we should give him a call.  Trust me.  We don't know what we're doing.  He was drinking vodka and some kind of vodka and soda or something. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know what it was.  Like vodka and soda.  Rufanol.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened.  You have 40 or 50 of those and...  Yeah, well...  Your phone's ringing.  Yeah.  What is...  It's always ringing.  You never turn your ringer off.  You're the...  You know, I lost $20 on the way over here.  What do you mean you lost $20?  I lost $20.  Wait, hold on.  Let me see who it is first.  Oh, God.  Who is it?  Nobody I know.  Private number.  All right, answer it.  Does this happen to me?  No, I'm not answering it. 
[00:16:00]  No?  No.  I'm going to turn the phone off.  Your birthday's coming up.  Yeah, well, I wonder what I'm going to get for my birthday.  We'll give you a nice party.  Yeah.  Two weeks.  When's your birthday?  April 1st.  April 1st.  April 5th.  I like that, don't you?  All right, listen, listen, listen.  Every time I come here, there's a private number.  Go ahead.  What?  I want to know when you're going to have the runs again.  And I also want to know...  Don't worry, you'll know.  She's a trot.  Well, no, that's why I'm asking.  Can we record it?  No. 
[00:16:30]  Fair is fair.  We'll give you a little bonus money.  Hey.  A little bonus money.  Lady Di.  A little bonus money to record me having the runs?  You've got to understand.  You've got to look back at the history of our interns.  Now, you are an intern here.  Yeah.  You've got to look back at people like Cream Pie Jones.  Sure.  Who did Duty Hat.  Right.  You've got to look at Pat Duffy.  All right, listen.  Who did Duty Eating.  If you're going to give me a little extra money, because I lost $20 today.  Oh, she's in.  We didn't have to sell it, Aunt.  But you could come to the bathroom with me, but you can't look. 
[00:17:00]  I don't want to look.  All right, well.  And no one could go in the ladies' bathroom with you.  You have a little boogie under your nose a little bit.  It's just, you know.  Sam, you think she'll.  That's why I got tissue.  This is what we do.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This is what we do.  Someone has to monitor Lady Di.  When you think you're going to have the run, someone's going to follow you with the actual  recorder.  They're going to.  Hold on.  Will you listen?  What are you doing?  Oh, I forgot about this.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Was that an intern?  Oh, she doesn't even know I was talking.  That was me.  No.  That was you going to the bathroom?  She has no idea. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  I went to the bathroom.  Sam, I'm going to talk to you.  What you were saying.  Hey, I got makeup on today.  Oh, that's wonderful.  You look good.  Yeah, thank you.  Except for this.  That's all right.  It'll go.  Well, when the baby's delivered, that'll go away.  Yeah.  Sam.  Little baby.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, boy.  It's astounding.  Sam, someone's going to monitor.  When she's going to go into the bathroom to have the runs, someone's going to give her the  actual recording device on recording.  Already on.  It's already recording.  You sit there, Lady Di, you record it, and we'll give you some bonus money today.  That's it. 
[00:18:00]  That's it.  All you have to do is hold it in your hand.  Okay?  And you can talk.  You don't get shit on it.  You can talk to it a little bit.  That's how it works.  And then you put it up on the thing, and you wipe up nice.  That's what I hate when I have the ones.  That looks delicious.  What's that?  Oh, no.  Don't.  No.  I don't want.  What is this?  It's just a nice beverage to start the morning with.  It's a giant coffee colada.  That is the.  Is that the biggest size they make?  Is it?  He went out to Dunkin' Donuts and got me a coffee colada.  Did he?  You said you like it.  You like him, Di.  He said, give me the runs.  You already have the runs.  He can't get the runs. 
[00:18:30]  You can't get more runs.  You feel sick, so we figured this would be a nice little thing for you.  Like when I'm feeling sick, I like to have a little ginger.  A little treat.  A little ginger ale.  That'll cool your throat down and everything.  It's nice.  Take a sip.  Those are phenomenal.  They are good.  Just one.  Just have it.  What flavor is that, Di?  It's pretty good, right?  Mmm.  Coffee colada.  How good is that?  Aren't those good?  Oh, those are the best.  Very cold.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I gotta wait a little bit.  Yeah, let it warm up.  That'll help the stomach, though.  What happened after?  Yeah, you'll get rock freeze. 
[00:19:00]  Lady Di.  Why did this lady hang herself on Mick Jagger's girlfriend?  We're going to get to that.  Yeah, it's very sad.  She hung herself.  She put something around her neck.  I'm guessing she was depressed because she was millions of dollars in debt.  Depressed to going out with Mick Jagger?  Well, no, but I'm guessing it was the debt.  She was very in debt.  Probably.  Oh, that's a shame.  Yeah.  She was a shame.  Her business lost, what, $6 million or something?  Oh, that's a shame.  Yeah, she was in debt for $6 million and she's $6.3 million.  I thought she was $39. 
[00:19:30]  She's $40.  I thought she was younger for some reason.  $49, yeah.  That's young for Mick Jagger.  I mean, he's pushing $70.  But that's old for Mick Jagger because Mick Jagger likes him 22, 23.  Yeah, he likes some young chicks.  He's a very nice person.  We met him in person.  He's very bright.  I remember that.  Yes, I was going to take a picture with him, but you came over and he walked away.  Lady Di's not lying.  You chased him away.  That's right.  Well, I chased him away.  Mark David Chapman couldn't have gotten rid of him faster.  Can I tell a story, Lady Di?  Oh, because we have new listeners. 
[00:20:00]  Okay.  Wait, hold on.  The funny part about it is...  Whose idea was this?  I was just thinking I hope Colin died.  She doesn't.  For the new listeners.  Tell Sam what happened.  Oh, shit, me.  Huh?  What happened with the...  Was it the MTV...  It was the Music Awards, right?  And Lady Di and Marion were our correspondents.  It was the VMAs.  The VMAs.  And we were there, but we didn't really talk.  We allowed them to do our jobs.  And Mick Jagger was coming over to talk to us, saw Lady Di, and abruptly stopped walking 
[00:20:30]  toward us.  They walked away.  How are you?  Hi.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  He shook my hand.  They were a little aggressive at the time.  He shook my hand.  He shook mine, too.  There was no photo of him.  So...  He shook your hand?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  No, what do you call it?  Somebody got photos on the internet.  Yeah.  No, they're not.  All right.  They did not.  Oh, but were you going to try to tell her?  Where are the photos?  From a long time ago, someone had photos of the VMAs.  You know what's frustrating?  This is gold.  Not Mick Jagger enough.  And if you have the chance to mold it, it would be an amazing listening experience,  but you can't get to that point. 
[00:21:00]  No.  It's almost impossible to...  All right, Lady Di.  That's terrible.  Oh.  What's that?  What's...  Drug...  Drug litter apartment.  I don't know what that is.  Okay.  Can you go answer the phones for us now that you're here?  Why not?  All right.  Welcome to the show.  We're happier here.  Listen, I'm going to need help again.  You got it.  All right.  You got it.  You're right.  You're going to tape this proper today, Sam? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Lady Di is going to go answer the phones.  There's a couple things.  Make sure you congratulate her on her baby.  That's due in a couple months.  That's true.  And obviously could bring up the runs if you feel like it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  Anything you got.  Your own experiences.  Right.  Cures.  Sure.  Things that might help.  I kept on drinking beer yesterday.  Yeah, that'll do it, Di.  A lot of beer.  How many natty ices have you had this morning?  I didn't have any.  Oh, boy.  Now, now.  Why did you put my water away?  It was done.  You almost had no left. 
[00:22:00]  Now, Lady Di, let me ask you this.  Have the colada.  You said you didn't eat at TGI Fridays.  She's taking the colada.  What did you eat for dinner last night?  Nothing.  I slept most of the day.  I slept most of the day.  I took my vitamins, though.  You didn't eat anything yesterday except beer at TGI Fridays.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  That's not very healthy, Lady Di.  You got to eat. 
[00:22:30]  Did you have anything this morning?  No.  All right.  Have another sip to come this time.  Oh, my God.  You got to get something in you.  There's a lot of healthy calories in that colada.  And milk products kind of calms the stomach.  It is cold.  You got to have breakfast.  Yeah, you get your calcium from that.  I know.  It's bad.  But I wasn't hungry.  Oh.  You know.  Yeah, because your eyebrows are penciled in.  I know they're penciled in.  What?  I did that on the train.  Lady Di, what was the last thing you had to eat? 
[00:23:00]  And when was it?  Oh, very good question.  It was the day before.  The day before what?  Why?  What's wrong with you?  You got to eat.  You can't eat that.  Yesterday?  No.  Two days ago.  The day before yesterday.  What did you eat?  What did you eat Sunday?  Eggs, potatoes, you know, my usual.  And then yesterday you had nothing.  I had nothing yesterday because I wasn't hungry.  And now today, so far, nothing.  No breakfast, no nothing.  You can't do this.  You're getting it very sick.  You have to eat.  You got to eat something, Lady Di.  Seriously.  Well, this is my food right now.  It's not my food.  You know what?  Have your coffee colada. 
[00:23:30]  Have another sip.  It's very nutritious.  Please.  It's got some milk products, a little bit of sugar to give you a boost.  Right.  And some coffee.  That'll get you going.  What should we get for breakfast?  Yeah, that'll get me going all right.  Yeah, you should have some breakfast, though.  What do you want?  That's why you're, by the way, that's why you're shitting a lot, because there's nothing  in your stomach.  So it's all weird liquids mixing and coming out.  You got to have food in there to kind of soak everything up.  What are you going to eat this morning?  What do you want for breakfast?  What do you want for breakfast?  Our treat.  On us.  We'll get it.  On us.  On Jimmy.  What do you got?  I'll buy food.  Yes, I'll be off for breakfast. 
[00:24:00]  How about a nice...  How about a donut?  How's that?  No, it's not good.  A donut is shit.  I don't want...  No, I don't...  How about you to eat healthy while you're among us?  Donuts.  How about an egg sandwich?  A bagel with some...  Oh, that'd be nice.  A nice bagel with eggs on it and some maybe tomatoes or whatever.  That's good.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You don't know?  That sounds like a lot.  Bacon, egg, and cheese?  Bacon, egg, and cheese.  Bacon, egg, and cheese.  What do you mean?  That sounds like a lot.  Colada's good.  She's enjoying it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  We'll get her... 
[00:24:30]  Sucking that right down.  A nice bagel...  I'm thirsty.  I hear you.  You got little boogies, Di.  Under your nose.  Di, I got little boogies.  Little boogies.  I'm just telling you so you don't look at that lady.  Poor Di.  This was happening at TGI on Friday, too.  That's all right.  Well, that's all right.  And the guy was still fucking...  Still grinding on you.  Grinding on you.  Yeah.  He said, here's some napkins for you.  Go ahead.  But did he have an assist dog with him?  A guide dog?  No.  Okay.  No?  We're worried about you.  Yeah, you got to eat.  You got to take care of yourself.  You got to have a nice breakfast today. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  What do you want?  We'll buy you anything.  Bacon, egg, and cheese?  But it has to be sort of healthy.  Or a nice bagel.  How about a nice bagel?  Because that'll sit in your stomach and suck some...  Bacon, egg, and cheese.  How's that?  All right.  Bacon, egg, and cheese.  A what?  A bagel.  Get her a bagel.  What kind of bagel?  A bagel?  No, I said bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want a regular bread?  Regular bread.  Okay.  All right.  White toast?  Yeah.  White toast.  All right.  White toast with a little deer.  Yeah.  That's a good one. 
[00:25:30]  Uh-oh.  You sure you don't want anything else?  Huh?  What's the matter?  You all right?  Like I said, I'll let you know.  Uh-oh.  That was an uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You feel a little gurgle, aren't you?  A little gurgling?  You feel a little gurgling.  Cool it down with some of that coffee colada.  You got to cool it down.  You just sucked out.  Hi, Kenny.  Thanks, Kenny.  Why is Kenny shaking his head?  He's trying to hide his rod.  Oh, poor Di.  Oh, Lady Di.  We got the recording device ready to go? 
[00:26:00]  You just, uh, in case.  Well, not yet, but I'm starting to feel it again.  Puckle it a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry, sorry, you're starting to stop me.  Yeah.  Getting that little weird muscle pain in the back of your legs?  Yeah.  You getting the squeaky door yet?  Yeah, you got to put some food in there, because the liquid now has nothing to kind of grab onto,  so it's just coming right at your hiney.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  Yeah, we worry about you, Lady Di, for real.  Well, thank you very much.  Yeah, panties must be a disaster.  Oh.  I got a Not Sam t-shirt.  Okay, good.  Cool, please wear it.  It just comes out of nowhere.  No, I'm going to wear it if you take off that, if you cut out that, uh...  Okay, we'll cut it out for you.  Scull and the crossbones.  Sure.  Why?  What's the matter?  Because I don't like to wear stuff like that.  Scull, why are you sculling crossbones?  I know it's part of the shirt, but I don't like wearing stuff like that.  Yeah.  Well, believe me.  When the girl Kelly Richardson gave it to me, you know, she mailed it to me. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Kelly and Dave.  Right?  Who are they?  Well, they, uh, they, uh, they told me, you know, I said, is it okay if I mention you  on the air?  They said, yeah.  Okay.  Um, they mailed me the t-shirt.  Uh-huh.  She did.  Okay.  And I got it.  The Not Sam part is nice.  Thank you.  I think it's very, it's very cute.  But when I saw the skull and the crossbones, I said, oh my God.  No, that's no good.  It's kind of pirate-y.  No good.  Yeah, but I don't like wearing stuff like that. 
[00:27:30]  Nah, that's no good.  No good.  I mean, I mean, I used to be a Grateful Dead fan, and I used to wear stuff like that all  the time.  Yeah.  But now, with Days, it's like, I don't like wearing stuff like that.  Nah, I'll go for that.  All right, listen, we got to go to break.  You're a Grateful Dead fan.  What song you want to play in a break?  Grateful Dead?  Yeah.  Oh, the Grateful Dead?  Um, uh, Touch of Grey.  Oh, wow.  Touch of Grey.  Wow, you're hardcore.  That is the one song that I think every Grateful Dead fan.  I can't stand.  Oh, no, she's hardcore. 
[00:28:00]  You go pretty deep with the Dead.  Touch of Grey.  Pretty deep.  Casey Jones.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That's going real deep.  Another deep track, yeah.  Deep track.  Which one?  It's your choice.  Touch of Grey or Casey Jones?  Touch of Grey.  Look, it says Touch of Brown.  Let's do Touch of Grey.  That is good.  Lady Di's going on the phone, so, uh, you know, talk about the runs with Lady Di.  Oh, yeah.  Talk about her, uh, her pregnancy and whatever else. 
[00:28:30]  And also, you might be running to the bathroom very soon, right?  I don't know yet.  We'll see.  All right.  Have some colada.  Here's Lady Di's choice today.  We'll be back.  Okay.  Okay.  It must be getting early. 
[00:29:00]  The clocks are running late.  Ain't my number more than the sky.  It looks so phony.  Dollars breaking everywhere.  By the candle curse left layer.  Draw the curtains, I don't care.  Cause it's all right.  I will get by.  I will get by. 
[00:29:30]  I will get by.  I will survive.  I see you've got your list out.  Say your piece will get out.  Yes, I get the gist of it.  But it's all right.  Sorry that you feel that way. 
[00:30:00]  The only thing there is to say.  Every silver lining's got a touch of the rain.  I will get by.  I will get by.  I will get by.  I will get by.  I will survive.  It's a lesson to me. 
[00:30:30]  The evils and the beggars and the seeds.  The evils and the old musk face.  Try to keep a little grace.  I will start.  I will grab.  Bye bye.  Every überfured disorders cost me. 
[00:31:00]  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  It's a lesson to me 
[00:31:30]  The demons and the east and the frees  The ABCs, we all think of 
[00:32:00]  And try to clear the new world  No red is in our ears  The dog has not been fed in years  It's even worse than it appears  But it's all right  Cows give me kerosene  Kid can read seventeen  The words he knows are all obscene 
[00:32:30]  But it's all right  I will get by  I will get by  I will get by  I will survive  Sure as all the hand it fits 
[00:33:00]  There's really nothing much to win  Whistle through your defense  Yeah, cause it's all right  Oh well, a touch of grain  Kinda suits you anyway  That was all I had to say  Say it's all right  It's all right  I will get by  I will get by  I will get by  I will get by  I will get by

[00:34:30]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  We got Bella Knox coming in today, huh?  We sure do.  That's pretty cool.  I haven't watched her movies at all.  She's pretty hot, though.  I've watched a few.  How are they?  They're pretty good.  Oh, just that one we saw.  She's very sad.  I've watched a couple more, too.  So, she does take a good dickin'.  Confused by her, though.  Why?  What's up?  I don't know.  I think she wanted to be a porn star the whole time, right?  Yeah, I think she enjoys being a porn star. 
[00:35:00]  Tell you the truth.  I feel bad for the parents, because they look like assholes.  Not coming up with the money.  I guess, what was it, Dr. Drew last night had her on?  And Dr. Drew said, if I was your father,  I'd want to bite down on a cyanide capsule.  Oh, he said that?  Yeah, and there was a problem with that.  I guess a bunch of people were like,  Suicide isn't funny.  You know, everyone's offended.  He didn't apologize, did he?  I don't think he did, yet.  He said laughing.  If you were my daughter, 
[00:35:30]  I'd be putting a cyanide capsule in my mouth.  And I think that was a little controversy.  You know, people don't think a doctor like him  should be making light of suicide.  Well, I mean, when the story first came out,  everyone thought, oh my God,  this poor thing had to do porn to pay for her college.  And no, I don't believe that anymore.  No.  She wants to be a porn star.  She wants to have a little fame.  Yeah, it's working for her.  And she found a nice angle.  She did it. 
[00:36:00]  The schoolgirl going into porn.  That's fucking a great story.  Yeah.  And I'm sure Duke is trying to figure out how to  make sure she doesn't come back.  We'll see.  I think, I don't know.  We'll see what her angle is now.  Will we?  Yeah.  We'll all get smitten.  I know.  I was thinking about that last night.  I'm like, oh, she's going to come in.  It's going to be,  you're cute.  You smell good, too. 
[00:36:30]  God.  Let's turn into a fucking asshole.  I know.  I can't help it.  There's some serious questions there, though.  I don't know what to do.  Whatever.  We'll see what happens.  Just sit there.  I start imagining.  Do you really?  Oh, maybe if I, you know.  You'll be flirting.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When it comes to the compound.  I'm thinking, oh, you know,  just picture her in the jacuzzi.  Oh, this is so nice.  I'm so glad I came on your show.  Right.  Oh, it's all right.  What will you have?  Right.  What do you want? 
[00:37:00]  We're just hanging out.  Her answer is another host.  That's what I'll have.  Oh, this cumbersome bikini.  Yeah.  That's me saying that.  And while you're wearing one.  Yes.  And when girls go naked around your pool,  do the neighbors see?  Well, there are some vantage points  where they could see.  They could see.  But it's an Asian guy that lives behind me,  and he doesn't have any interest in anything. 
[00:37:30]  What?  From what I see.  No, he doesn't have any interest in anything.  You know those very straightforward old business.  Straightforward Asian guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Although one time him and his wife  were fighting out on their bedroom balcony,  and it was great.  Really?  Yeah, just yelling in some faraway language.  Some Cantonese or something?  Yeah.  And then he beats his mattress.  He brings his mattress out on his back patio,  and then just beats the living shit out of it  with like a big stick. 
[00:38:00]  What?  Getting the...  Donk, donk, donk.  I don't know what he's getting out of it.  Don't the sheets take care of all that?  I would think you don't got to beat your mattress  like every fucking month,  but every month he's out there  beating the shit out of it.  Get that dead skin out of there.  Or something, right?  Yeah, but if you have  sheets on your bed constantly,  you're not...  You have sheets.  You're not going to have a dirty mattress in general.  Peachy pads, whatever you need.  I've had girls squirt on my mattress, though.  Oh, yeah?  You betcha.  You betcha.  And that just soaks in.  Yes, it does.  So he could see the pool from where he's at. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's got a good vantage point from his patio,  but he doesn't.  What about the other neighbors?  The other neighbor...  There's only one other neighbor  on the side of the house,  and there's one window  that he can see out of,  or his wife,  or they have kids,  you know, whatever.  Right.  And the kids actually...  Somebody was having a birthday party  over our house.  I think Travis might have been there.  Remember when all those kids came over  from next door?  Were you there? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, I think so, yeah.  Yeah, someone was having a birthday party.  It was a kid's party at my house.  I can't remember who it was, though.  And the kids from next door came over.  Yeah.  Because they wanted some cake or some shit.  And then they started...  I think, was it Vinny  that was questioning the kids?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, so, what are your parents?  Do parents ever talk about,  you know, what goes on here?  Oh, yeah, my mom gets mad  because it's really noisy late at night.  And then she caught the husband  looking out the window. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, and Dad's always looking out the window.  Oh, that's great.  Crying.  I never get it in, buddy.  Yeah, and you know the wife is like,  what's that asshole up to today?  And he's, nothing.  She's going to make him, like,  close off the window.  Yeah, you're just going to see it bricked up  like an old New York City building.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  So there's a couple of people  that have vantage points.  But for the most part,  once you're in the pool,  and especially in the jacuzzi,  no one can see anything  because it's all, you know,  got a lot of vegetation around there.  And in the jacuzzi sometimes.  Oh, boy.  That's making a comeback, is it?  Oh, you know it is.  Like that.  All right, so I'm going today with Ghost Plane.  Ghost Plane.  And that's the latest.  Every day it changes.  Yesterday it was suicide.  And now most people are saying  they don't believe that anymore. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, Malaysian Flight 370.  I'm going Ghost Plane.  I'm going with severe malfunction.  Now they're talking maybe electrical fire, possibly.  Well, they're saying.  Shutting down some systems.  They knew something was up.  They were trying to turn the plane around.  They could only turn it so much  when everything just completely failed.  And then you got Ghost Plane  for seven, eight hours  into the middle of the Indian Ocean  and then it crashes.  But it hit those points.  The problem is it hit  all those really weird points.  Right.  No, they said that they have a hard time.  They never want to say  it was suicide for some reason. 
[00:41:00]  Never.  They always want it to be something else.  I think it was one of them.  But Ant made a great point  right before the show  as far as the suicide thing goes.  This guy,  one of these guys was for,  he was against the political party  that's been, what,  in office or whatever you want to call it  for the last 60 years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got a little problem with Malaysia.  And, all right,  so if he's going to make  some huge political statement  and kill himself.  Right.  When he turns that plane around,  why not,  well, it's your thing. 
[00:41:30]  Go for the fucking towers  there in Malaysia.  Oh, man,  what a fucking coup  that would be, right?  And he's right there.  Boy, you're making a statement  against your own government  and your own,  your own people, I guess.  And he was right the fuck there.  Could have done it in no time.  But, you know.  May not have been for that reason.  Maybe he didn't want to,  maybe he didn't want to  commit an act of terrorism.  He might have been depressed  because he was really into that.  That guy went to jail for five years  and he also had insurance money  for his family.  You don't get the insurance,  I'm sure,  if you commit suicide. 
[00:42:00]  They don't find the black box.  Yeah, maybe.  It was all those points  they hit, I thought.  They said an experienced pilot  would have to have hit.  Didn't they hit a bunch of points  that, um,  there was something  that he did in the prep.  Even that is off of radar  and not off of their transponder.  So everything they're talking about,  where it turned,  how it turned,  is to a point speculative still.  Right.  Altitudes, things like that,  that's all speculative. 
[00:42:30]  Tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, too.  top, top, top, top, top, bottom.  But, uh,  it could have been  some kind of electrical fire  that shut off the system sequentially,  you know?  Maybe, maybe an electrical fire  shuts off the transponder  and then shuts off  a few other communication devices.  They still have some control  of the plane,  but then why wouldn't you  radio and say  you have an emergency?  Like, there's every scenario has these pieces missing from it.  Like, all right, it could be suicide. 
[00:43:00]  Well, then, why did this happen or this happened or that happened?  All right, it could be a catastrophic failure.  Well, then, this couldn't have happened.  Oh, it's terrorism.  Well, then, what about this and this?  So every scenario's got something that makes that scenario not seem like it would work.  That's what makes it so fucked up.  And if they were going to use the plane for evil, you have to do it right away.  There's too many days that have gone by, and now everyone's on to you.  You would think it's much easier.  I would assume our government is on to, you know, putting in some safeguards now just in case. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, and someone starts yapping.  Who knows?  The longer the plane's on the ground, if it is on land somewhere, the easier it is for somebody to say something.  You just need one person to yap.  Yep.  I mean, it could be Pakistan just blatantly lying to us once again.  Yeah.  Got to put that on the table.  No, that would be a shame in front of the whole world, though.  That would be a bad thing, the airport doing that.  Yeah, so.  Well, you know what?  I'm proud to say that Aliens is still on the table.  Aliens is on the table.  Officially, it's still on the table. 
[00:44:00]  I think even CNN is going with that angle so they can continue their 24-hour coverage of nothing happening.  They got five minutes of material.  That they have been milking for weeks.  Milking for 10 days.  It's unbelievable.  They have nothing new, and they just go in this circle over and over and over again.  Some guy on Twitter yesterday was saying, he goes, well, the only thing I've learned from CNN is how to shut off critical electronic devices on a 777.  Yeah.  It's like, great.  They pretty much are telling people how to shut off the transponder, how to shut off the other communication devices. 
[00:44:30]  You see the chode on CNN that's just hanging out in the flight simulator?  Dude, what a great gig.  He's just hanging out like, yep, we're flying.  This is pretty much the, you know, the flight pattern they would have done.  And then he just goes over to the pilot guy and is like, well, let's see what would happen if we go down to 20,000.  Right.  And then he goes, oh, all right.  But he's got nothing.  Nothing.  Here's the transponder by my knee.  Let me show you how easy.  It's three clicks to the left.  Oh, boy, thanks. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, thanks.  I was wondering how to do that.  Appreciate how you do that.  Yeah, that looks fun.  Although, I think Courtney Love found the wreckage, right, Travis?  And Courtney Love has tweeted that she is in on the search.  Travis is a big fan of Courtney Love.  So am I.  Mystery solved.  I don't know why we're still talking about it.  Mystery solved.  She found a big oil slick and a plane, apparently, underwater.  So why isn't anyone taking it seriously?  And wrote it in childlike red fucking.  Yeah, she put it in MS Paint.  MS Paint fucking writing.  I think she also said, you guys. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you guys.  I think I found it.  I think.  Look, I don't know much about this, but this looks like a plane.  How great would it be, though, if Courtney Love actually did find it?  Courtney Love.  That would be amazing.  Has found the plane.  And what was it, only a mile offshore or something?  It's very close.  Right, Travis?  Isn't that what she said?  Something like that.  Now, I'm no expert.  She's plotting.  She's got fucking maps in front of her.  Yeah.  What is she doing?  Yeah.  A mile offshore.  Nothing has come back to it.  No.  Nothing has washed up on shore.  A mile. 
[00:46:00]  Let's go to her Twitter.  She tweeted about it all day.  And I think even Rolling Stone picked up on it and a few other sites.  Of course.  It was widely reported.  Widely reported.  But not on CNN.  They're not acknowledging that Courtney Love found the wreckage.  Did you guys read the article that I printed out for you this morning?  Which one?  No.  The first turn was programmed in.  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't know.  All Lady Di is answering phones and they're good.  Yeah.  Yes, she is.  Okay.  Here's Courtney's tweet.  Huh?  I just saw Courtney's tweet.  Where?  Sam had it up and now it's gone. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, all right.  I'm no expert.  Yeah.  But up close, this does look like a plane and an oil slick.  And then she's got the thing.  Prayers go out to the families.  Wait, there's an arrow plane?  Question mark?  Yeah, yeah.  Look at her childlike writing.  And look, there's the plane and there's the oil.  It doesn't look like that.  She found it.  She found it, man.  She found it.  Courtney found it.  Where's the plane, Sam?  I don't see planes.  It's right there.  Did you see the CL for Courtney Lovedon?  Right. 
[00:47:00]  Jim, maybe you need a few more drugs in your system to see the plane.  I don't see a plane.  You've got to defocus your eyes.  Yeah, squint.  And then you'll see the 3D plane.  Squint.  Everything comes into focus.  Hey, man.  There it is.  I can't see it.  Hey, man.  She found it, though.  So go to her Twitter.  If that's it, could you imagine if that was it?  And Courtney's like, yeah, it's right there.  Well, you've got to think someone said, all right, what the hell?  We'll take a look at this.  And then said, oh, God, this is nonsense.  We can't report on this. 
[00:47:30]  What was Courtney looking at that she discovered this?  Is she doing that thing where everyone is searching for the plane?  Where is everyone searching and what are they using?  I don't know.  I've seen it and talked about it a few times.  Is there something out there?  I haven't seen this yet.  You can look at little squares of the ocean, and then you mark stuff you think you see.  And if enough people mark stuff they think they see, then an expert goes and looks at it.  Oh, yeah?  And supposedly there's millions of people doing it.  Wow.  And each square is like...  It's called Tom Nod. 
[00:48:00]  How many blocks is each square?  Again, six blocks maybe, I think they said.  But how...  So you pick a square.  It's like, okay, that's six blocks of the ocean.  I think it's six blocks.  Is it live?  Yeah.  It's a crowdsourcing tool that uses satellite.  All right.  So it's satellite image, but it's not a live stream.  You can't do that.  You can't get that kind of fucking shit, give it to the public.  I don't know.  It's pretty current.  I would guess there are photos that they upload or download from the satellite and then 
[00:48:30]  upload onto this webpage every so often.  But how often is it...  They said it's current enough where, you know...  I want to know how...  But what...  I'll just play a lot of...  Each square is how big?  I don't know why I'm obsessing about this.  Each square is...  I think the equivalent of six blocks.  Yeah.  Something like that.  This is crazy.  But a lot of people are doing it.  And I forgot how many squares there actually are.  But people are like, yeah, what the hell?  I got some free time.  I'll check out a few squares. 
[00:49:00]  I'll check out a few squares in the interim.  Right.  Oh, could you see if Sam just fiddling around right now and it pops up and the plane's right  there?  But what sucks about it is you can't be the only person...  Like, if you see the plane, like, oh my God, they're still not going to pay attention  to you.  A lot of people have to see the exact same stuff you did and then it gets their attention.  But I'm sure if you screen cap it and send it to CNN and go, hey, look, someone might  want to check out the lat and launch of the whole thing. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, it's true.  It doesn't say there's no info on how often that thing updates?  No.  Because it would be useless if it's like fucking...  No, it's definitely not useless.  2012?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fucking years ago.  See, possible alternative flight path now.  Oh, yeah.  Does it seem reasonable?  Is it reasonable?  So I guess that's the latest on...  I'm going to have to look into that thing.  On the airplane, right?  See what that is.  We don't have to do a CNN and spend hours on this. 
[00:50:00]  I think that's about the latest.  No, that's about it.  I guess they've searched both of their apartments, houses, whatever, for any...  And the search area has officially been extended to the entire globe.  It's like the whole earth now.  At this point, look at the circle on Fox News.  That's pretty much the entire globe now.  Do you know how...  It went from a piece of Australia to half of Australia now.  Do you know how big Australia is?  They really moved it to half of Australia?  Yeah.  It went from the coastline of Australia. 
[00:50:30]  It could have been here.  And now it's halfway through Australia.  How do you organize that search?  Oh, the talking heads they've had on CNN.  Oh, they bring up the...  Here's a flight recorder.  Here's what it looks like.  Let's talk to the flight recorder expert.  Here's a few pilots.  Here's this flight instructor.  This guy is a naval guy.  Here's...  And they all have nothing.  Nothing.  That's that.  I absolutely think the pilots were involved.  Could they program something? 
[00:51:00]  If they program stuff in the computer, why would they do that?  How is there not one distress button?  But both pilots, they didn't really know each other, right?  Before this flight.  No, that's just...  So then the one pilot has to, like, strangle the other one.  And then there's a big commotion.  Right.  No, what I do is stand up as you're taking off, whatever.  You stand up, you take that fire extinguisher, you pull it off the wall quietly, he's fucking...  And you crash it as hard as you can to the back of his head.  He is out. 
[00:51:30]  That's not hard to do.  And then you hang out for fucking eight hours of flying.  No, maybe it was...  Maybe it was what the thing you said.  Maybe it was a suicide where you got decompressed at the plane.  Well, he would have...  Here's the thing about the rapid decompression thing.  The climb up to 45,000 feet was very steep.  The flight crew isn't going to question what's going on in the flight deck.  The stewardesses and fucking flight attendants aren't going to go, 
[00:52:00]  Hey, why the fuck are we climbing like maniacs?  Maybe it was decompressed by that point.  Maybe they decompressed it and then went up that high.  You decompress a plane really quickly, no one's ready for it.  Then the oxygen masks drop.  The flight attendants know how to handle emergency situations.  That's true.  Again, there's that time frame where you're not able to communicate.  Can you control the oxygen mask from dropping?  I don't think so.  Well, yeah, can you stop it?  So then you're not going to kill everybody. 
[00:52:30]  People are going to be smart enough to put those masks on.  Well, they do have a limit.  They have a limit.  Like, you could run out of oxygen with those masks.  That's why you fly that long.  Ghost ship.  And you're just...  But in that time where you still have the oxygen,  why aren't you trying to use the onboard fucking phones or something?  Right.  Write a note for later.  You know, I mean, that's going to wash up somewhere.  I don't trust pilots anymore.  No.  I can't imagine flying now. 
[00:53:00]  Crazy.  You don't know what kind of problems these guys have as they go into the cockpit.  You don't know.  He's having a bad day.  Right.  What if the pings are wrong?  What if it crashed really early and they're just misreading those pings?  Yeah.  Maybe.  I don't know.  But they were getting signals from the engines.  What is this?  Ace of Anther!  Oh, that poor little guy.  Every mom out there has been through that. 
[00:53:30]  Poor little guy.  He looks like he's 12 years old and he's still in a car seat.  Nice mom.  Carolina's receiver, Steve Smith, had been traded to the Ravens.  How could they?  Exactly.  How could they, Steve asks.  It was a viral video.  And it eventually reached Steve himself, who reached out to that family.  Oh, God.  What a game.  And then said, your kid's fucking sucks.  Mind your business.  Really?  Can we get that video?  Please.  I want to check out the whole thing.  It's the kids crying because they traded Steve Smith.  That, by the way, was little Anthony right there. 
[00:54:00]  That was a prime example.  Except instead of being videoed and like, oh, that's terrible.  It was shut up.  Stop your piss.  Stop your pissy eyes.  That would have been the viral video of the day like four times.  Oh, yeah.  Once again, we have little Anthony Comia crying at the name game.  And in the back, you hear, shut up, you bitch.  Shut up, you bitch.  I was weepy.  Yes, you were.  I was very weepy.  You really were a fucking wash woman. 
[00:54:30]  Give you something to cry about.  Stop crying.  I'll give you something to cry about.  Jeez.  Was he going to crack me in the head and make me cry?  It was crazy.  Let's see.  Chris Brown ordered a stay in jail.  Whatever.  Chris Brown's in jail, huh?  Yeah.  Get a little street cred in there.  That's what happens.  You're going to keep him in there, too, because he was bragging about being able to, what, 
[00:55:00]  use guns and knives and stuff.  I don't know.  By the way, a steep ascent.  Don't forget, like, they may have said it was a steep ascent, but they may, the crew  doesn't know how high.  Steep ascent?  Yeah, the crew may not.  The crew doesn't, the flight attendants don't know exactly how high you are.  They can't tell the difference, I'm sure, between 34,000 and 45,000 if you're going up  quick.  I guarantee, though, if you're climbing fast, they know, a flight attendant would absolutely  know what a standard climb is and what a steep fucking climb is and wonder what the 
[00:55:30]  fuck is going on.  So you get on the PA, because there's no black box as of now, and say, oh, we're going  to be a, it's going to be a little bit of a steeper ascent to avoid some weather.  I don't know.  I think it's probably easy for a pilot to do.  From what they said and how quickly they climbed to that altitude, it would have been  a move that, like, would have alarmed people that are familiar with how that plane flies.  But if you can't communicate with the ground.  That's true, too.  Then it doesn't matter anyway.  If you're just a flight attendant going, uh-oh, there's some trouble here. 
[00:56:00]  You know.  Yeah, who cares?  Then they're just banging on the door trying to figure it out.  Hey, let's see this viral video.  Oh, is this the little fucking shit?  This was just on Fox News.  Shall we?  What's the story there, Sam?  Young Samuel.  Yeah.  It's a little kid getting told that Stephen Smith was cut.  From the Panthers.  Right.  Okay.  Chili Peppers drummer?  That's not him.  Well, that's Chad.  The Panthers said that they didn't even want him on the team anymore. 
[00:56:30]  So they fired him.  Why did they fire him, Daddy?  Because they say he's too old to play.  Why was he too old?  I don't know.  But now, so now we won't have Steve Smith.  Looks like young Eastside Dave.  So now we have to cheer for Kidding.  How do we purposely make a kid cry?  Yeah, exactly.  Just to get a video.  Just to get a viral video.  What are they doing?  Who are we going to cheer for on Sundays now?  Nobody!  Ah!  Cam Newton, Luke Keekly, Cam Newton. 
[00:57:00]  And the kids are all logical.  Little kids are all logical.  We'll just cheer for the other guy.  Yeah, we'll cheer for the other guy.  It's only uniforms.  It's all you're cheering for.  But there's other players.  What about Luke Keekly and Cam Newton?  What about Cam Newton?  I love Cam Newton.  The little kids.  The other kid's smart.  And Luke Keekly.  So you're going to cheer for them now?  Yeah.  Are you still going to love the Panthers?  Yeah.  Gavin, are you still going to love the Panthers?  I'm not going to like anybody.  Because they fired Steve Smith. 
[00:57:30]  This video stinks.  That's a viral video?  Who gives a fuck?  All it takes.  What the fuck am I trying so hard?  All it takes.  Screams?  I'm going to make my kid cry.  Fuck it.  That's all you got to do.  Exactly.  Just let me listen to this radio show.  You got to be willing to make that jump to a fucking despicable human being.  Look, man.  We've done some pretty shitty things with this radio show.  But one thing I can't imagine is making my own kid cry to make a viral video.  That's fucked.  That's a little weird, right?  That is.  A lot of people are doing that, too.  Crying kids do make great videos, though. 
[00:58:00]  People love it.  Yeah.  Did you hear about this man that rented his apartment out?  When he returns to find an orgy of fat people?  Where does he fucking rent an apartment out where it's the shady?  Probably a fan message board of this show.  No shit.  What's Airbnb?  I don't know.  There's full services, because my buddy did it for his bachelor party, where people have  these New York City apartments.  Right.  And then they, it's usually illegal, they list their apartments for, like, rent the way 
[00:58:30]  a bed and breakfast would.  Right.  A bachelor party?  You know how fucking, you can't have anything.  That's crazy.  And they say, like, you know, for this, for whatever, 250 bucks, you can have the apartment  overnight.  Mm-hmm.  You just have to clear out by the next day.  Right.  And so people do this.  And so that's what this guy did.  What is Airbnb, though?  Which one of those services?  Oh, one of those companies.  Okay, gotcha.  It lists apartments that are available.  Now, I've heard of this as far as, you know, the U.S. Open, comes to town, the golf event 
[00:59:00]  or whatever, and your house is close to the course, you're like, fuck, I can make $20,000  or whatever for the week.  You know, I've heard that.  I've heard all that before.  But I've also heard that you could trade apartments, too.  Like, you know, you have a kick-ass New York pad, and someone in Spain, let's say, has  a kick-ass pad in Spain, and you guys, you could switch for a week.  Could you see doing that, letting someone be in your space?  It was really weird when we did the...  I think my, I'm embarrassed to say this, but I think my cook actually did this.  Cook.  People are doing this. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah?  It's kind of the hipper people.  They're like, wait, I could go live in Spain in someone else's place, and it's more homey  and, you know, down-to-earth.  People don't hate hotels.  I like a nice hotel.  Yeah.  Me, too, man.  Fuck that.  I think it's also a bit cheaper, too.  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.  If you do it that way.  You know?  Yeah.  My buddies all rented out this guy's apartment, and it was very strange, because they all live  in Connecticut, so it was like a big, you know, night in the city.  Connecticut.  That's right.  Oh, right.  But it was very strange, because all the guy's shit was still in there.  Like, he had all these watches and everything all laid out. 
[01:00:00]  His computer was there.  On the kangaroo.  And you guys were having a bachelor party in his apartment?  And they were all sleeping there, too, yeah.  And he let that happen?  He rented it out, yeah.  No one puked him?  Why would your friend do this?  They didn't want to pay for a hotel room, I guess.  Oh, God, I hate cheapskates.  I don't know.  I fucking hate cheapskates.  Did you go?  I went, and then I went home, though.  I'm not going to stay in somebody's apartment.  What kind of apartment was it?  It was a nice apartment in the middle of Times Square.  Oh, it was here in the city?  Okay.  Did it have a nice view? 
[01:00:30]  I mean, it had an okay view, but it was a very weird apartment.  And the guy had, like, mannequins all over it.  Oh, what?  There were probably fire people who had rented.  It was bizarre.  Right, yeah.  But they all slept there.  Did they make a mess?  Yeah, my buddy, like, fell on his face on the sidewalk and just jumped into bed with a bloody face.  Oh, boy.  Why did you see that?  He got under the sheets in his clothes and shoes.  He got under some guy's sheets.  He's some guy's in your bed.  Now, I understand the guy that has the apartment in Times Square, but why would he rent it to a bachelor party? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Instead of maybe a bunch of dumb old ladies from, like, I don't know, from Pittsburgh or something.  Unless it's all bullshit furniture, and he doesn't live there at all, and maybe you think the watches are fake.  He had a lot of accessories.  But they might be bullshit.  It might be, like, an old computer.  It doesn't mean anything.  Like, it might be so much to make it look like a real apartment, and you just rent it out to people, but it's all dummy stuff that you don't use.  It's basically an illegal hotel.  Yeah, and you had to, we had to tell the doorman that we were his buddies.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because you're not supposed to have people just coming up to your apartment. 
[01:01:30]  No shit.  Dude, do you know the insurance problem that you would have?  Because I have homeowner's insurance.  Homo?  No, I don't have that type of insurance, unfortunately.  But I wonder if that, what your insurance would cover if you start a fire and burn the building down?  Yeah, if there was just some stranger in your apartment.  Couldn't, right?  A firebug.  Yeah, what if you rented to a firebug?  Yeah, but I mean, nobody, you want to rent to somebody responsible, but you never know who's going to be a firebug.  How many people were in his Times Square apartment?  Eight, at least. 
[01:02:00]  What?  Have they slept there?  Are they the only friends he has?  Yeah, they all slept, well, I mean, it was, like, close friends, but they all, like, eight to ten guys.  And why did they pick Times Square for the bachelor party in this guy's apartment?  Well, they live in Connecticut, and they were like, oh, cool, we'll go to New York City and blah, blah, blah.  Dorks.  Ew.  What, are they going to go to a science fair after?  No.  And mow down together?  Mow.  Mow down for the last time?  Before the wedding?  Oh, my God.  Mow down.  Sounds horrendous.  I've never heard of mow down. 
[01:02:30]  That sounds horrible.  They went to some bars, they got all fucked up, then they found a spot to buy roast beef sandwiches.  They was at three o'clock in the morning, and they went home and fucking acted like men.  I guarantee with the Super Bowl that just passed, a lot of people rented out their houses and apartments in the area.  Yeah.  Guarantee.  I've heard it for sporting events, mostly.  But anyway.  I would like to have an apartment with, like, all fake signed sports stuff, just to see what turns up missing.  Oh, right.  Like, that would be kind of fun to do.  Like, you do all these autographs yourself on baseball, just to see what is stolen. 
[01:03:00]  See if someone steals it.  But it leads to today's story.  This is just amazing.  So, it's Airbnb renter returns to overweight orgy.  So, we got a guy like Sam's talking about.  He rents his apartment out.  Yeah.  This is what happened.  A comedian under the impression he had rented out his posh Chelsea pad to a man with family in town for a wedding.  Returned home to a wild orgy, he said.  Nice.  Ari Temmin, 31, claimed he left the apartment keys with David Carter on Friday night and stepped out for dinner before leaving town. 
[01:03:30]  I'm David Carter.  When he returned to the building to grab his luggage, a rowdy sex party featuring big, beautiful women.  Nice.  That's in quotations, by the way.  Yeah.  Was in the process of being shut down by building management.  Oh, boy, are you in Dutch?  This was just so bizarre, he said.  The worst part of the internet right there was in my apartment.  There were all sorts of people walking out of my apartment and people coming in from the backyard. 
[01:04:00]  It was a huge mess.  Ari said his apartment was trashed by a group of nearly nude overweight people after the shindig was broken up.  Carter was a nervous wreck in the lobby.  Carter was the guy that rented the place from the other guy.  Uh-huh.  This guy had a look of horror on his face, the owner said.  He didn't expect to see me for a few days.  He said, they shut us down, man.  They're shutting it down.  So this guy came back to his apartment because he forgot something or whatever. 
[01:04:30]  Boy, how do you, hold on a minute.  How do you go out for dinner and come back to get your luggage and all those people are already there?  Yeah, I thought that too.  That's fishy.  I think that's bullshit.  Well, maybe the guy's in on it.  Maybe he knew and that's just the excuse.  Like, hey, man, if you get caught, you're on your own, I'll lose the apartment.  Right.  Yeah, you're right.  That's a little suspicious.  He's a comedian.  I don't know.  I wish I knew him now.  I'd love to fucking do a gig with him.  Just ask him about the fat changes.  Right.  What happened, Harry?  Dude, they were all fat.  Don't laugh. 
[01:05:00]  Carter, who ran into the place, however, claims he just had a small, quiet get-together  and that the owner was overreacting.  I had six people, friends and family, Carter told the Post.  He was making a big to-do because he is being evicted.  When the owner later searched Carter's phone number on the internet, he found the raunchy  soiree involving plus-size women advertised online as Turn Up Party 2, the Panty Rain.  Nice.  One person even blasted out the owner's 7th Avenue address in a tweet for a triple-X freak 
[01:05:30]  fest.  How come I never get these tweets?  You probably just block them.  Maybe.  A bunch of fat people at a yard.  They walk in.  Big fat ass.  Nice.  Oh, wow.  God.  He threw all his sheets away.  Where's he, kid?  Blah, blah, blah.  I don't know.  But Jimmy's right.  Why would you say you're going out of town, but you go to dinner, but then you come back  for your luggage?  Yeah.  What did he do with his empty refrigerator?  He restocked it, I'm sure.  Piggies. 
[01:06:00]  A bunch of piggies in his house.  Because when you tell the guy, look, I'm coming back for my luggage.  Yeah.  Maybe he was double-checking on him or something, I don't know.  Yeah.  Maybe he saw her to Buffalo head up fucking 8th Avenue and he's like, wait a minute.  Water Buffalo-er.  Yeah, he saw the party going, walking through the Midtown Tunnel.  Water Buffalo-er.  Buffalo-er.  I want to hear that again.  Oh, it was so good.  Lady Durr.  I couldn't stop laughing at that all day.  That was a good one.  Absolutely.  Lady Durr. 
[01:06:30]  I was standing in the post office by myself laughing like an idiot over Lady Durr.  Lady Durr.  Lady Durr.  Stupid Bobo.  Do you have Lady Durr?  I have both of them.  Which one do you want?  I want to hear Lady Durr first.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I wanted to congratulate Lady Durr.  She's also...  I wanted to congratulate Lady Durr.  Lady Durr.  Lady Durr.  Lady Durr.  One more time on that one.  God. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, I wanted to congratulate Lady Durr.  She's also...  It's not even a word or anything.  What happened to you, Vince?  His brain just switched gears.  Like when a movie switches reels.  Yeah.  That's what happens to him.  And then the other one.  Hey, I just want to congratulate you on your baby.  That's great.  Is the father a water buffalo or an elephant?  The father is a water buffalo.  One who buckles water for a living. 
[01:07:30]  I went to water buffling school.  Yes.  I'm a buffalo.  I want to be a water buffalo like my father. 
[01:08:00]  He buffled water better than anyone.  Do we have a Lady Dye update?  Was she answering phones?  She is, yeah.  Or she was.  Did she do a good job?  Mm-hmm.  Do we have anything?  We will after the break.  Oh, good.  And how's her runs?  So far, she hasn't had to make a trip to the bathroom.  How's the coffee colada?  It's being worked on.  All right.  Where is she?  She's right here next to me.  She just, in reference to the runs, she informed Sal and I that it's coming. 
[01:08:30]  How much of that colada did she go through?  She's about a quarter of the way through.  She's kind of nursing it.  Yeah.  But she's enjoying it.  If you're just tuning in, listen to the...  Oh, wait.  She just said, here we go.  What?  You know what?  Can you answer the phone?  Sure.  I gotta go.  Wait.  Follow her down the hall.  No power.  Where are you going?  To the bathroom.  I got it, Sal.  I think it's coming again.  Wait.  All right.  I'm not sure.  I think so.  Wait.  Tell her to come in here for a second. 
[01:09:00]  She's got a second to come in here.  Just make her shit herself.  Please don't.  We'll keep talking until she shits her pants.  Tell her to come in here for a second.  Yeah.  And get a recorder.  A recorder going down the hall.  All right.  She's coming in real fast.  We got Bella and Knox coming in in a few minutes, too.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  How you doing?  Yeah, okay.  Just a quick update.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You all right?  Hmm?  Other...  Man.  What's going on with you?  I might.  I might have to.  Why?  So what's going on? 
[01:09:30]  I might have to go to the...  I run to the bathroom again.  Your eyes are running like a fucking cocker spaniel.  Tell everybody.  Well, we just want to know how you're doing.  We're a little...  Did you eat your breakfast?  Huh?  Where is it?  It's in there.  You got to eat, Lady Di.  We're actually...  You haven't eaten for two days.  You should be hungry.  I'm not hungry.  We're worried about you.  You got to eat.  You haven't eaten since Sunday, and you've had a lot of beer since then.  You're going to have to force it.  Yeah, okay.  And your body is just getting...  What are you grabbing?  She's holding her...  What are you holding?  I'm trying to talk to you. 
[01:10:00]  What are you doing?  She's holding her pee tunnel.  Oh, boy.  I'm holding my stomach.  Is that where...  Go over there.  Talk to me.  We can't handle it.  What's going on?  Why are you holding your stomach?  I'm a little worried about you here.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  You feel like I'm okay?  You feel like the runs are coming?  Is it percolating?  Is it...  What?  You're getting a little cramping?  Yeah.  You're cramping up?  Yeah.  Well, can I go to the bathroom?  You can do what you want.  You're an adult.  You're an adult.  We just wanted to talk to you a little bit.  We're chatting with you.  We want to have a little chat with you.  Okay.  Oh, there you go.  No, no, no.  That's all right.  All right, Sam.  Why don't you walk her to the bathroom and record her?  Please.  I don't know if we can record in the bathroom, to be honest with you. 
[01:10:30]  I don't know if anything's going to happen.  Can you wait a little while?  I want to talk to you.  Can you wait a half hour?  What?  Can you wait a half hour?  No.  All right, hurry back, because we want you...  Bring your colada.  I can't wait a half hour.  No, I'm not taking that to the bathroom.  Yeah, bring it in the bathroom.  No way.  I don't bring food in the bathroom.  You don't do stuff like that.  All right.  That would be crazy.  Sam, record her is going in the bathroom.  We're going to take a break.  Bella Knox will be in studio next.  She's the one that was paying for tuition at Duke by doing porn.  Yeah.  Bella Knox is lovely.  I hope we have a camera in here and videotape this lovely young lady.  Yes, we'll do that next. 
[01:11:00]  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on SiriusXM.  Where's Bella Knox?  Where's Bella Knox?  Why am I looking at E-Rock and Sam?  Yeah, what the fuck?  I know Bella Knox.  Looking at E-Rock.  Duke University's Triple X Vixen.  She's going to be at headquarters, huh?  Yeah, she'll be at headquarters here in New York City. 
[01:11:30]  West 38th Street.  Say on.  Nine o'clock tonight or thereafter.  They're smart, man.  They get a lot of these headline-grabbing girls.  They're really smart.  They certainly do.  And, of course, Bella Knox started pouring to pay for her tuition at Duke.  And Roland was all...  He's very, very tiny.  Very smart.  He's really cute.  Cutey.  It's like, yeah, well, it's obvious.  Obviously.  And we got some really good Lady Di updates. 
[01:12:00]  That's all I'll say right now.  Jesus Christ.  After the Bell Knox interview, we'll...  Bell Knox is sexy, man.  We'll go back to Lady Di.  She's part Indian.  She looks Indian.  I'm going to guess American Indian.  No, yeah.  Native American or...  You think?  Yep.  What do you think?  India Indian?  She's half Indian.  Could be India Indian, dude.  Oh.  She's half Indian.  Big batch.  It's a bit of a meaty one, right?  I think.  Like a nice one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's American Indian.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah, because American Indians got the big papoose.  They really do.  We've talked about that before. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's more of those warrior dances or something.  Of course.  I love them.  That's where the young come from.  When I hear a girl say, like, yeah, I'm half French, half Native American, I leak clear  stuff.  You just know.  Yeah, it sounds like a sink.  You just know it's going to be a big fucking meaty.  With that combination?  Yeah.  What are you?  Well, I'm Polish, French, and Native American.  I'll fly you here.  I don't even need to see your face or head.  You know it's going to be a good one, huh?  Yeah, Polish girls are sexy, too, man.  I like Polish girls a lot. 
[01:13:00]  Do you get all disappointed when you see a little bird-like vag?  Um, as disappointed as they do when they're asked to go home.  But I thought we were going to, no, that's not the plan.  Chirp, chirp.  I find out before.  How do you find out?  We talk about it.  Oh, oh, okay.  That's a good thing to say.  It doesn't have to be tiny and gigantic.  No, no, I wouldn't imagine it would happen.  But I don't like it completely minuscule.  Right.  Oh, my God, she's tiny.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, she's a tiny little thing. 
[01:13:30]  Are they bringing her in?  Come on in.  Yeah.  Hi.  What's up, Bill?  Bill Knox.  Take a seat.  Welcome to the show.  Pull up a chair.  How you doing?  Ooh, pretty busy girl.  I'm just turning it off.  Oh, it's okay.  We don't care.  Wow.  Courtesy nobody else gives us in here, turning their phones off.  Right.  Yeah, take a seat.  We're actually on the air. 
[01:14:00]  It happens every time.  Yeah.  How's it going?  How are you?  What's going on?  Did you guys watch her on Dr. Drew?  Of course.  Sure.  Dr. Drew.  I caught the first interview there on Piers.  He wants to bite.  It was a fun one.  What does he want to bite a cyanide capsule?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he said.  He said if he were my father, he'd be biting down on a cyanide capsule, and then he laughed.  Right.  Yeah, huh?  And then he went out to dinner with your father.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, he did?  Her father, who's a veteran.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My father, who's a veteran, actually.  So he did.  He went out to dinner with your dad.  No, I went out to dinner.  Oh, I was going to say.  Wait a minute.  I thought you went Dr. Drew did, too.  That would be hilarious.  I thought it was Dr. Drew.  That would have been amazing.  Oh, my God.  That's sick fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a horrible, horrible joke that, honestly, as a doctor, he...  I mean, his responsibility to me, first and foremost, I think, was as a doctor.  Yeah.  And to, like, imply that my father should commit suicide, or that it was so embarrassing to 
[01:15:00]  be related to me that, you know, it was horrible.  Why was he saying that, though?  Was it just like, hey, you know, if you find out your daughter's doing adult movies, it's  hard, or is he trying to be a dick?  They were talking about my family, and he said that comment, so...  How are things with the family?  Things are great, actually.  Yeah.  I mean, my mother, you know, is conservative, so there's obviously that, like,  cultural struggle for her about pornography, but she's been really supportive and, like,  loving, as well as my father. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Are they trying to dig up money for your college now?  No, I mean, they're just trying to be, like, emotionally, like, here for me.  Right.  Yeah.  It seems like it's past the point of just money at this point, right?  I mean, you enjoy what you do.  Yeah, I absolutely enjoy what I do, and I mean, at this point, it's not just the money,  it's like, I think I actually have made kind of a cultural statement, and I'm seeing now  that I actually can break down some barriers for how we treat sex workers. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, sex workers kind of get treated really lousy and, like, looked down on, and you don't  want to stop doing it.  I was the first person, I was the first porn star to ever go on The View, so that just  says, you know, like, I'm breaking down those barriers, those walls between the mainstream  and porn.  Well, you're kind of a different, you're kind of different than most adult film actresses.  She's a gender studies major.  But it's like, yeah, yeah.  But it's like, obviously, you don't want, on The View, they don't want, like, hey, hey, 
[01:16:30]  hey, like, some drugged out fucking bubble head that goes on, and, you know, because that's  the image everybody has.  It's the image, but that's totally not what, you know, most porn girls are like.  I feel like they pick those girls on purpose to make, you know, us other porn girls.  Well, they're entertaining, is what they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't get to deny that, right?  It's all show business.  Are you going back to Duke?  I know you're taking some time off.  Yeah, I took, like, a week and a half off. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Just because being there was too stressful for me.  Right, right.  But I'm coming back.  You are?  I am, yeah.  I was hoping, I wasn't, I was assuming, I should say, that Duke was trying to figure  out how to keep you away.  Hello?  Oh, just a phone.  Duke was trying to keep you out or no?  No, not the Duke administration, but the students have absolutely been trying to.  Ew, what little fucking douches?  There's a petition, there's multiple politicians going around to get me kicked out. 
[01:17:30]  You should have seen all of this.  By the students and not the administrators?  That's embarrassing.  That is embarrassing.  I bet it's chicks, right?  It's girls.  It's frat guys.  Frat guys?  Why frat guys?  What was their problem?  Why is it frat guys?  Because they're all a bunch of mo's anyway.  Yeah, there was a bunch of parody accounts that were saying that they were going to throw  trash on her and that she should slit her wrists.  Jesus.  And that she, I mean, it was just amazing the number, like, I've been able to get some 
[01:18:00]  of them shut down via Twitter.  What do you think, like, frat guys' problems would be with you doing that?  Okay, well, just to explain, and I mean absolutely no offense by this, but I think that a lot  of the, I think that when you have a school like Duke, you have a lot of, like, this male  white privilege.  Oh boy.  That translates into this, like, culture of entitlement and men feeling entitled to  women's bodies, basically.  Why would you think they'd be mad at you for that, though? 
[01:18:30]  Why would they be?  Yeah, why would they care?  It's a culture of slut-shaming that we have on college campuses.  You know, we have the walk of shame, you know?  Yeah.  It's, it's so, it's so deeply ingrained in kind of college culture.  Who is the guy that, like, there's one guy who outed, like, I didn't mind, I thought they  gave that one guy, even though he might be a douche, a hard time, because, like, if you're  a young guy and you know a girl who does porn, you're going to tell everybody you know, because  it's just kind of hot and cool, like, I know this girl who does adult movies.  People just like to talk.  You never meet a girl who does that, much less know her, but, like, how did you know 
[01:19:00]  this guy?  Um, actually, we were friends.  He actually tutored me, like, quite a bit in math class.  Had he hit on you?  Um, no, he hadn't, but, um...  He wanted to.  That's probably what the problem was.  I don't know the screen grabs that you showed me.  I thought he tried to kiss you or something.  Well, what has happened...  I feel like you're covering for him a little bit.  I am covering for him.  Yeah.  Why?  Um, I mean...  She's a nice girl.  You have no idea.  I don't want him to get bullied, but, I mean, you know, the re...  What happened was, we were on our way to kind of, like, a party, and, um, he kind of 
[01:19:30]  confronted me because he was suspicious I was doing porn, and I confirmed that I was  doing porn, and we pinky swore on it, and he promised me he wouldn't tell anybody.  Oh, God.  And then...  I didn't know you pinky swore.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  He broke a pinky swore?  How dare he?  Oh, my contracts are one thing, but a pinky swore...  A pinky swore, it's like...  You believe in pinky swears?  It all depends on where the pinky was.  Oh, so, it was.  That's a different kind of...  Yeah, but, um...  One in the stink. 
[01:20:00]  We got to the party, um, and, uh, let's just say he wasn't in the right state of mind.  Good job.  Wait, but how did he figure out that you might be in porn?  He had watched her.  Recognized him.  Yeah, but where?  Like, how did...  I think that it was because I was on...  Because you said he was suspicious, so he wasn't even sure that you were in porn.  I was on a pretty popular website for, I guess, college guys.  I didn't know it, but I was on this website called Fucktard18.  Oh, God, yeah.  You've read of it?  Fucktard or Fucktard? 
[01:20:30]  Fucktard.  I got Fucktard.  Oh, Fucktard.  All right, that sounded...  Oh, I thought you said Fucktard.  Fucktard is like...  I was like, I've never heard of Fucktard.  It's like Bobo.  Absolutely.  I'm a Fucktard.  Yeah, that's really...  I'm buying Fucktard.com right now.  Yeah.  There's some money to be made with that one.  It was embarrassing because actually in the Fucktard 18 video, I told like a story of  me like dressing up at Halloween and getting shit-faced and then hooking up with a guy.  So it was like, it was like, so like probably that guy saw the video, but yeah, anyway. 
[01:21:00]  So he confronted you and you said you'd never tell anybody and then was he drunk when he  told people?  Um, I'm not going to verify that, but...  What do you think he might have been?  Yeah, he was drunk.  I'll verify.  Yeah, um, he...  That happens when you...  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Uh, it was also rush week, so, you know, everybody was drinking, but, um, and then I denied...  He tried kissing me, I denied him, and then, um...  Why'd you deny him?  You didn't like him?  He's my friend, you know what I mean? 
[01:21:30]  Um, he was my teenager.  Oh, you know how bad that is for that guy?  It's like, look, you're fucking guys in this video.  Right.  I'm your friend, fuck me!  Just kiss me!  And you wouldn't even kiss me!  Jeez!  You realize this is like the nightmare of a guy being friend-zoned.  Right!  This is the ultimate worst-case scenario.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, it's very rare you want to actually be a friend.  It's hard to be a hot girl.  Yeah, we said we'll be friends with you, but it's...  No, you're always trying to figure it out.  It's really hard.  It's kind of creepy, though.  I hate when I...  I've had that happen to me where I became super good friends with a guy, and then, like, 
[01:22:00]  five years into our friendship, he goes, yeah, I've been in love with you this whole time.  Of course!  Yeah, there you go.  But you thought, like, women, I think, get used to it.  Like, don't...  Didn't you kind of sense, like, you guys will block out the obvious signals, like, because  you don't want to lose the friendship and...  Yeah, totally.  Or we'll, like, deflect it with comments.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, if you ever need to talk, he's not treating you right.  The white knight syndrome, yeah.  Bell, can I ask you a question?  Yeah, totally.  Okay, so yesterday, you were talking about how, like, rough blowjobs really turn you on. 
[01:22:30]  Yes.  So, if he would have asked you if he could, like, fuck your face in, like, a forceful,  rough manner, would you then have been like, oh, maybe I should give this guy another look?  Would you have thought he was...  Would you have thought, like, oh, man, he's got confidence.  He just asked me...  He honestly would have upset me even more.  Oh, man.  Just because I wasn't...  I have no attraction to him.  I didn't like...  You know, I don't like him like that.  If it were a hot guy and he was like, I want to fuck your face right now, I'd be like, 
[01:23:00]  bathroom, now.  But, like, it was...  I wasn't attracted to him.  So...  Bathroom?  Have you really done that?  Uh...  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Jesus.  Hey, do you think that he told on you because he was pissed off at you?  Do you think he was like, well, fuck her, then I'll just blow her secret up?  Oh, yeah.  Was that, like, a cop-walk movie?  Oh, fuck, yes.  But, wait, I have a funny story to tell about the whole bathroom thing.  Oh, let's see.  Yes.  Please.  Do tell.  She has really good face-fucking stories. 
[01:23:30]  I love a good face-fucking story.  I'm like her hot, dirty step-mom.  Oh, my God, yeah.  When I was in high school, my boyfriend, well, he's not my ex, we volunteered at a, like,  a little preschool-type thing as teacher's aides.  Yeah.  The stalls in the bathroom were about this big for little kids.  Yeah.  And, uh, so it was recess time, and, uh, we went to the little boy's bathroom stalls.  He's six foot seven, and he, so his head was, like, poking out. 
[01:24:00]  Jesus Christ, what a monster.  And then I just, like, got to my knees and sucked his dick in, like, a preschool bathroom.  In a preschool bathroom.  Yeah.  What a trooper.  So did that turn you off?  It was just a joy.  Oh, it was so hot.  It was just a joy.  Wow.  That was fucking good.  I think it's safe to say you're a delight.  I'm confused by the tuition angle, though.  It seems like you were going to go into porn no matter what.  So why tell everyone that you went into porn to, um, pay for college?  I mean, I don't think, I absolutely disagree that I would have gone into porn to do something else. 
[01:24:30]  I mean, I, I think that it just, all it is is, you know, if I hadn't needed the money, I would have never looked into porn.  That's not to say that porn was desperate or something I did.  Honestly, I can say that every woman I've ever talked to, when they think about money, they immediately think about sex work.  I've had this conversation with conservative, yeah, yesterday, I was like, I think I might have too much cellulite to strip, but like, I don't know.  Like, I, you know.  It's really a thought for all women that they think of that? 
[01:25:00]  I have had this conversation with the most conservative women, and they always think, oh, yeah, worst case, you know, porn, stripping.  It's fast, it's easy money.  Absolutely.  Everybody knows.  Yeah.  But did you go to your parents at any time and say, look, I'm thinking of doing this so I can pay for college?  Actually, I kind of did hint at it with my parents when, when they were like, you know, you need to take out loans.  I kind of, like, joke, half-jokingly was like, well, I'm going to have to do some illegal things then to pay for my call.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Did you ever do any privates, like, what, was it always on film, or did you, did you try to make money on the side, too? 
[01:25:30]  Well, those private collection type of videos, I, to any girl who's listening to this and who's been kind of asked to do something like that,  I would, I would say be very cautious about it, but, I mean, personally, just for me, I feel uncomfortable doing things like that,  or even just doing, like, POV scenes, it makes me feel personally uncomfortable.  I like having the crew around me to make sure that, like, you know, there's no abuses, and it just makes me feel uncomfortable to be, like, in a one-on-one session, you know, with somebody in there. 
[01:26:00]  She actually has boundaries and standards, and a defined no list.  Everybody has those.  No one over 35.  Oh, shit.  I know!  Well, that hurts.  There's a reason behind that.  What's your no, why?  I know her.  Why, why, yeah.  I feel like I'm fucking my father.  Wow.  That's exactly the reason that they like him.  But you would make an exception, right, if the guy was really hot.  Oh, fuck yeah.  There you go.  But, I mean, it's just, like, I feel as though I'm having sex with my father, and it makes me feel 
[01:26:30]  uncomfortable.  I'm going to go home and hug my daughter.  We all have our boundaries.  I'm in a panic attack.  I saw that.  Mandy, how do you know her?  So, she wrote a story for XO Jane.  She's written two stories.  She wrote one where she was anonymous.  And you're on XO Jane, obviously.  Yeah, and those stories have been the most traffic we've ever had.  This girl's like a rock star.  So, the first one was anonymous.  She said, I'm the Duke porn star.  And, you know, every single person who tweeted that story, they were like, this woman is 
[01:27:00]  a rock star.  Because some of the things that she said were like, I know it's going to make you guys vomit.  But, like, she said things like, patriarchy fears female sexuality.  And so, she appealed to all of these highbrow and lowbrow people, which, like, that crossover  doesn't normally happen with porn stars.  And then the second one, she outed herself.  And then today, she has a story actually distancing herself from, I'm just going to say, from facial 
[01:27:30]  abuse, which was her first experience.  Have you guys watched facial abuse?  No.  No.  I've been a victim of it.  Oh, goodness.  We should screen that immediately.  So, I've watched a lot of dark porn in my time.  I've never watched as dark a porn as on this site.  They showed close-ups of where, when she was younger, she had done cutting. 
[01:28:00]  They said she was fat.  Like, it is a mind-fucking sight.  Wow.  It's just misogyny.  But in their, you know.  In their defense, I know, you're a very, you're the nicest person in the world, Belle.  Okay, the first thing is I want to say that doing that article for Exo Jane was by far  my best decision in this whole situation.  It was a game-changer because it showed people that I was actually intelligent.  Yeah.  Such a good decision.  I'm so glad I had the opportunity to write it.  And, I mean, as far as the whole facial abuse thing, I completely agree that, I mean, the 
[01:28:30]  principle behind the website, it's like, we have freedom of speech in America.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, um...  You had hand signals of consent.  We did, but, I mean, I've actually...  Now, afterwards, now that I've researched into the website, I'm reading these testimonies  from women who went on it.  Right.  And a lot of the women, it appears that they weren't as consensual as I was.  Yeah.  You were playing a role.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, the principle of the website, you know, the mind-fucking-ness, that's free speech  men, but it's like, if they're not treating the performers right, then that's what I have in it. 
[01:29:00]  So there's a lot of choking, fucking gagging, smacking.  It's not just that, they, like, their scenes where, like, they literally will make fun  of the girl for being molested as a kid.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Like, they get in your head.  What is...  I don't understand.  Like, Max Hardcore, a guy, Paul something, his name is Paul Little, I think, he started  a lot of that whole thing.  Max Hardcore was the guy who was involved...  Went to jail for four years.  Exactly.  He was associated with facial abuse.  Yeah.  Because he sent it to the wrong place, like, in Tampa, I think, and that was...  They get you on these weird crimes where it's male fraud or, like, or whatever. 
[01:29:30]  Trafficking.  So what did he do?  He would do, like, the whole...  He would pretend girls were underage.  He would actually pretend they were underage.  Right, right.  And he would fuck them.  His dick wasn't that big, though.  So he would...  But it wasn't.  Like, he would fuck them in the mouth really hard or...  Yeah, you little cunt.  Like, he was, like, that type of guy.  But it wasn't real.  Like, what you're saying is they're making fun of a girl for being molested.  That's a different...  That's a different thing.  This was obviously just a guy being really dirty.  Yeah, we got a question coming in from Matt about this very topic. 
[01:30:00]  Matt in Connecticut, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hi.  Hi.  I watched one of those rough face fucking scenes.  This guy with tattoos was beating all over you.  Please tell me that was a lot of acting more than anything else.  What, of the cock?  I mean, what acting?  Wow, the guy was slapping you around.  Oh, me crying, yeah.  Well, just...  There were times during the scene where it was, like, too much, and I said stop, and they 
[01:30:30]  immediately stopped.  But, like, I mean, it was acting, you know what I mean?  Like, I did...  It sounds crazy, but I did genuinely enjoy, you know, getting my face fucked, and I felt  totally exhilarated afterwards.  Well, and were you weeping or were your eyes watering?  I wasn't crying from, like, sadness.  I was crying because when you have, like, a nine-inch piece of flesh, like, shoved down  your throat, like, you're gonna cry.  Wow.  That was a great statement.  Sir, can you stop talking so I can just enjoy what she just said for one moment? 
[01:31:00]  He's got a follow-up question, though.  I know.  Hold on.  I'm morally safer.  I'm fucking enjoying that.  Wow.  And, I mean, if you look at, you know, my face when he's like, you're fat, I look more  annoyed than I look offended.  I'm just like, yeah, okay, whatever.  What's the attraction to saying that?  Like, I don't get it.  Like, what is it?  What is it?  They're trying...  It's...  They're trying to degrade me.  They're trying to break her.  They're trying to like me.  I think there's a small portion of guys out there that enjoy watching that shit.  I don't get it. 
[01:31:30]  It's so niche.  I don't like...  I don't really like the sex a lot.  When I watch rough sex porn, I like the girl just to, like, get her face fucked and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's like, I don't like, like, I don't want to hear some chick being made fun of for  being molested.  Like, that's horrible.  That would be a fucking rod wrecker.  That's a boner killer.  Right.  You don't want to, like, what the fuck is that about?  Because then you start to, like, all of your guilt comes up and you're like, what the fuck?  I just wanted to, you know...  I don't want to think so much.  I just want to see nudity and fucking...  How would they know that? 
[01:32:00]  How would they know about...  If you were molested, how would they know that?  Well, what they do before the scene...  Oh, did this person have a follow-up question?  Oh, I heard of a follow-up.  Oh, he's gone.  You're so lovely, though.  Anyway, well, what they do before the scene is they'll sit you down and they say, okay,  so this is what's going to happen in the scene.  These are your hand signals.  This is what, you know, you put your hand up if you want to stop.  And then they ask you, like, questions about kind of your life.  What happened for me was I was very guarded going in there because I didn't want them 
[01:32:30]  to say anything personal.  But as soon as I took my clothes off, they noticed the scars on my leg.  Where are your legs, are they?  They're just right here on my left eye.  And they noticed the scars on my leg.  And the first thing they said was, those are cutting scars.  And I was like, no, they're my cat.  That's a fucking leopard.  And then they said, well, why did you cut?  And I just kind of made up.  I was like, well, I mean, like, I thought I was fat or something.  And they were like, okay, we'll go with that.  Like, they get into your head. 
[01:33:00]  Why did you?  I cut because I was really, I was just, I was 13, or 12 and 13 years old.  And I was just really, really depressed with my life.  And I mean, to anybody out there who's listening right now, I think just, you know, you should  find inspiration in the fact that I was a cutter and I have scars on my body.  But I'm still, you know, I'm a successful, you know, model, you know.  And you're five years clean.  And when you look at, when you look at famous cutters, it's everyone from Princess Diana 
[01:33:30]  to what's the one who's the huge Disney, Demi Lovato.  I mean, it is so common nowadays for women to try and take control of depression and self-hate  by doing self-harm.  It's like so on the rise.  It's scary.  Why were you doing, like, yeah, what was it about?  Because I did it when I was a young teenager.  Believe me, my ex-girlfriend told me I was an emo lesbian when I was a teenager.  I was fucking awful.  I totally resent those, you know, characterizations of people who cut as emos.  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.  I mean, I don't like that either. 
[01:34:00]  Fair enough.  We're a good couple.  It was a way to kind of, like, feel, like, more alive, if that makes sense.  And I totally don't recommend it to anybody.  Like, don't do it.  If you're thinking about hurting yourself, you should, you know, talk to somebody, call  a helpline.  Right.  Yeah.  How did you...  Oh, good.  Well, there's a phone call that I just want to take really fast.  A guy from Canada.  James, go ahead.  Hey.  I just want to say, I believe I speak for the majority of guys right now. 
[01:34:30]  I am officially walking into work with a boner.  Yay!  That's great.  I hope you don't work at that school that they...  Yeah, he's a school.  He's a first-grade teacher.  I know that bathroom.  How did you, like, because a rough blowjob is a really hard thing to get a girl to do.  They scare me.  Like, I'm always worried there's going to be, like, a mishap.  So, how did you know that you liked that?  Like, did a guy do that to you?  And you're like, wow, I'm kind of responding to this.  It was...  When I was, like, you know, 12 and I started watching porn. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ, Bill.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  No, no.  Slow down.  Oh, wait.  Okay.  So, I write about this in my, um, the XO Jane article that's coming out today.  I, ever since I was little, I have no idea why I've always just been super attractive  to rough sex.  You know, I would have my...  I write about this, but I would have my friends...  Well, and just the idea of something different and masochism.  You used to, like, want to be put in a dog cage when you were a little kid.  Like, it was exciting to you.  You know, when I would play house with my friends.  But you did not have...  Clarify that you didn't have sex when you were 12. 
[01:35:30]  You just were looking at porn when you were 12.  I was...  Like most kids today.  You have, you know, your sexual urges.  When you...  You know, when I was a kid and I would play house with my friends, I would be like, I  want to be the dog.  You should lock me in the dog cage.  You know what I mean?  Um, and...  Sexy.  I mean...  Yeah.  I get it.  I mean...  I want to know what it was, because I'm interested in that.  Because a lot of...  I've known a lot of men that have had that fetish with dominatrices, but I've never...  I met a woman, I'm sure, that had that.  What was it about being, like, so... 
[01:36:00]  Uh, was it the fact that you'd be being ignored that was hot?  Or what was it that was really hot about that?  It was...  Um...  It was being helpless.  That was, like, so super hot to me.  And I think that the thing about blowjobs that, like, maybe makes it so hot for me is  I'm, like, an assertive person.  I speak my mind.  You know what I mean?  And so it's kind of like...  Okay, this sounds so bad.  But it's kind of like, you know...  It's so...  It's like being shut up in a way, you know what I mean?  Like, I have this, like, big dick in my mouth. 
[01:36:30]  Nobody can hear the smart things I have to say, and it's super fucking hot.  Is it like...  Is it...  That's really sexy, huh?  I get it.  I get it.  Yeah.  It's like you're just, like, a whole...  The thing is, like, I went to Northwestern, which is...  That's probably not as good as Duke.  But, like, I'm a kind of over-ambitious...  You were a debate club champion.  I think when you're a type A super achiever kind of woman, to have the contrast of being,  like, face-fucked and told to shut up with a cock is very relaxing when all the... 
[01:37:00]  When the rest of the time, you're out conquering the world.  The same way that, like, a CEO business guy likes to be raped by a dominatrix.  It's just a different role.  Yeah, that's cool.  What about your upbringing?  Was there anything in your upbringing that led you to some of these things?  Or...  No.  Was it pretty much normal?  You can't think of anything...  No, I mean, absolutely not.  My parents were absolutely incredible.  I mean, they always prioritized my education.  They always told me, you know, they always instilled in me that I needed to go to college. 
[01:37:30]  So, I had really, really great parents.  I had a great family.  And no tragic events outside the home or anything?  I mean, no, you know, not when I was a child, but yeah.  You got brothers and sisters?  Yeah, I do.  Older, younger?  I have an older brother and an older sister.  How much older?  My brother's five years older.  My sister's, like, two.  Okay.  Do you guys get along?  There's a clash kind of between my sister and I,  because she's very, like, Catholic and conservative.  Yeah.  That would do it. 
[01:38:00]  So.  What about you and your brother?  How many fights a day does your brother get in now?  No, me and my brother are great.  Jesus.  I don't mean with you.  No, he's super supportive.  But, you know, when I did have, like, my first boyfriend,  he was like, if he hurts you, I swear.  You know what I mean?  But, yeah, they're great, though.  So, her father, who's in New York, I have to say,  is, like, the cutest nerdy dad that you've ever met.  And I think that, like, his open-mindedness and his intelligence, 
[01:38:30]  I mean, he's a doctor who just came back from Afghanistan.  Right.  Is, I think that when you have parents like that,  it leads you to have an open mind.  Because you have almost a more open mind than I do.  I mean, you were telling me,  you say these things about how sex workers shouldn't be marginalized,  and it blows me away that you're saying this is an 18-year-old,  and that you basically told Sherry Shepard  to shut the fuck up on The View yesterday.  Really?  How did that go?  Well, Sherry's really bright.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:39:00]  I hate to see that happen.  She's terrific.  Oh, I hate that beach ball.  What did she say to you?  How did it go down?  Well, what happened was...  Oh, she's the worst.  Sherry said she wanted to get her word in.  She hadn't said anything the whole time.  She wanted to get her word in,  and she just was like,  my heart hurts for you.  My heart hurts that you have to sell your body for money.  First of all, I'm not selling my body.  I'm selling an experience.  Yeah, girl.  But, and then everybody clapped, and it's like...  Yeah, she just said she was the most, like,  like, just caricature of a concern troll. 
[01:39:30]  She was like,  I just have to say,  my heart is breaking.  My heart is breaking.  She's just a dummy.  It's like she's overweight.  Then give me money.  If your heart is breaking so bad for me,  then pay my tuition.  Right.  And it's bullshit, by the way.  This whole sell your body thing,  football players wind up having concussions,  and they have arthritis,  and those are people that are selling their bodies.  How come no one's crying that they're selling their bodies?  What about selling your soul to a bank for 20 years  to pay off, you know, 
[01:40:00]  hundreds of thousands of dollars in college debt?  Holy shit.  I like a nice...  I think sex workers get shit on, though.  It's an easy target.  Oh, she fucks for money.  Like, so what?  Like, I have...  I hate the way sex workers get treated.  I'm just getting money for doing something  that every other girl, you know,  does or wants to do.  Now, if you had your tuition paid,  would you leave porn, or...  I wouldn't necessarily say that.  I mean, I love to, like, invest.  I'd love to save, you know, my money.  But, I mean, the bottom line is,  I'll quit whenever I want to. 
[01:40:30]  If there's any time and point  where I don't feel comfortable doing porn anymore,  I'll stop immediately.  You like the fame, though.  It's got to be kind of cool, right?  I mean, it's kind of, like,  really frightening,  but, like, it's kind of, like, awesome  to, like, have, like, these guys in high school  who never gave me the time of day  and who were assholes to me  be like, oh, hey, what's up, Belle?  And it's like, okay.  I also just want to say,  a lot of people think that this was all, like,  a manufactured stunt and controversy, 
[01:41:00]  and it took a lot of convincing for her  to do an article, and it was only anonymous,  and I've seen all the screen grabs of her  begging that guy to not out her,  so this is actually not a case of...  It would have been brilliant  if you did do it that way,  but it's not a case of a stunt.  It was completely accidental, I swear.  Sometimes these weird things  just happen to me in my life,  and I just, like, okay, I'll go with it.  Like the face-fucking-in-the-bathroom.  Yeah, yeah.  You really are a go-with-the-flow type of person.  I respect that.  Do you think that, 
[01:41:30]  did most of the interviews you've done,  like, whether it was...  I didn't see the peers' interview,  but are most of them coming at you  from that fucking predictable,  like, oh, that's terrible  that you're doing that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Except for the view  where Whoopi Goldberg...  I got a right on from Whoopi Goldberg.  He's amazing, by the way.  Yeah, she's all right.  And Gayle King.  Yeah, Gayle King.  Black women love you.  Yes, they do.  But every show I've been on,  I feel, has been like,  has been like,  why are you doing porn?  And even all the hosts of the show  have made offhanded comments. 
[01:42:00]  You know, peers made a comment.  He was joking to his producer  between the shots about,  oh, your daughter just called me.  She's doing porn now, you know?  And then Dr. Drew  with his fucking cyanide capsule comment.  Yeah.  But, you know, I do understand  that it's not necessarily  the views of the host or whatever.  It's just they're reflecting the views  of what they think other people think.  Then they're fake.  Then they're phony.  Yeah.  That's not what their job is,  to reflect the views.  Their job is to have  an honest discussion with you.  And the fact that so many guys 
[01:42:30]  jack off to porn and then attack it,  it just makes you nuts.  Yeah, jacking off with one hand  and then typing out death threats.  Ah, man.  Well, that could be a fetish.  Let's be honest.  Some wife will like that.  Let me say hi to Mike in Queens.  Mike, we're talking to Bell Knox.  What's up, Mikey?  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Okay.  So, Bell, I saw that facial video,  that facial abuse video you did.  And I think it was before or after the shoot.  The guy asked you a question.  And he said, 
[01:43:00]  look, you know,  you're in college  and you think it's unfair.  You see the world view  as males being favored in society.  Then he asks you,  turns it around,  and he says,  well, you know,  women are paid more in porn.  But then you said  you didn't see a problem with that.  What's up with that?  That guy was a total asshole  who was extremely harassing to me  before and after the scene  and actually leaked  very personal information about me 
[01:43:30]  during that entire situation.  Wait, was he the guy filming you  or the guy you were having sex with?  Yeah, he was both.  Okay.  Both.  Yes, but there was actually  another person around.  But I mean,  to answer your question,  I think that I was totally put on the spot.  I think that,  but at the same time,  I think that,  you know,  this might sound,  you know,  controversial,  but I think that men  aren't necessarily always  the focal point  when it comes to pornography.  Absolutely.  And I think that women  sometimes are more 
[01:44:00]  of like a commodity.  Well, that sounds very bad to say,  but it's like,  it's harder to get like a woman  to do porn  than it is to get like a man  to do porn.  But you're totally right  and I think that I should have  researched it more before.  No, you're right.  No, sorry, you're not right  because people buy porn for women.  Yeah.  Nobody buys it for the guy,  so financially,  it's just,  it's supply and demand.  Yeah.  Why do tall people get hired  to play basketball  more than fucking short people?  I think it's just economics.  It comes down to economics,  but I definitely understand,  you know,  what people are saying  that it, you know, 
[01:44:30]  if you want equality,  then it should be equality.  You know, I get that,  but I think it's,  it's economics  and it's what people want,  you know.  Well, I mean,  I'm just saying, you know,  it kind of seems like  a double standard.  But she just answered.  You don't want equality  everywhere except for porn.  She just answered,  but sorry,  it's a commodity thing.  She just answered that.  Yeah, but it's also,  you know,  a matter of capitalism.  You know,  I wouldn't,  I wouldn't want a woman  who can't,  he also brought up the idea  about,  do you think that a woman  who can't lift 50 pounds  should be able to work  at, what is it, 
[01:45:00]  a warehouse?  And I said,  no,  she shouldn't have even  gotten hired for it.  So it's like a balance  of, you know,  capitalism and also like,  you know,  feminism and I guess  like fairness,  you know,  you can't always have,  you know,  it's like you do what's best  like economically  and for you for capitalism  while also like taking  the humanity of the people  into account.  What's lame shit  to be talking about  on a porn.  I know.  It's like,  who is this dummy?  No, not you.  The guy is like,  I know.  Like, shut up and fuck.  Any arousal that I had  from earlier in this  interview is gone.  It's a valid question.  Say something about 
[01:45:30]  face fucking again.  But he could have said it  quickly.  He could have just said it  quickly,  but then you answered it  and he went back to it  in his slow delivery.  By the way,  Belle,  if you want to see her  tonight,  she's really,  really nice and sweet  in person.  Headquarters,  which is 552 West 38th Street,  which is a great place.  They always get like  these girls who are  like in the news  and really hot  and it's great.  So you can get there  at nine o'clock.  Headquarters,  great,  great club here.  And you're going to  dance for the first time,  right?  I'm doing all these  new exciting things.  Like,  actually,  the other day, 
[01:46:00]  so this is,  you know,  this is kind of like  my first time,  you know,  doing stripping  and it's going to be  freaking amazing.  But the other day  I actually went to,  you know,  Doc Johnson  and I got the cast made  for my new sex toy line.  So that was really new.  You really fucking  are taking the bull  by the forehead.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  It's basically a pocket pussy  and then my mouth  and my ass.  And I'm an anal virgin,  by the way,  people. 
[01:46:30]  Someone tried, right?  But it hurt too much.  Someone tried  and I was like,  get out of there.  So the mouth  is like a pocket mouth?  Yeah.  They made a cast.  You're a double zero.  That's your size.  I mean,  you're the most petite.  She's tiny.  The fattest pussy lips  you'll ever see.  I did see that,  by the way.  Jimmy's a fan.  There's nothing  that makes me happier.  Jimmy's a big fan  of the big pussy lips.  Yeah,  I could actually overlook  a severed head  if the vagina's really big.  Now,  it says here  you're Indian.  Are you American Indian?  Or Indian Indian?  It says half. 
[01:47:00]  I think it's probably  politically incorrect  to refer to the name  of American Indian.  It doesn't matter,  but you know what I mean.  American Indian.  Yeah,  I mean East Indian.  Okay,  so you're from India.  Yeah.  Okay.  On your mom's side.  On my mom's side,  yeah.  Because usually  American Indian women  have very large pussy lips.  It's a quality.  French girls do.  It's just a great...  Trust me.  I've studied this shit.  And I saw that.  I was so happy.  I would never lie to you about that.  I actually dated  a Native American...  Girl or a guy?  A guy, actually.  He was...  He was 6'7".  He was fucking tall. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  Belle is a three  on the Kinsey scale.  I am.  What's that mean?  She's as attracted to men  as she is to women.  Oh.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Bob Levy.  He's a comedian friend of ours.  Bobby.  Hey.  How you doing?  She sounds very intelligent  for her age in that.  I was just wondering,  like,  do you like to get, like,  choked in that during sex?  And you interrupt stuff,  like, getting smacked around?  Yeah.  I mean,  totally.  I love...  I mean,  I love getting, like...  I love, like, 
[01:48:00]  a guy just, like,  kind of holding me down  and just, like,  choking me,  kind of almost to the point  of me passing out,  but then, like,  not really.  But if it's consensual,  obviously.  Totally.  And then, you know,  I like the bondage.  In your video,  in your video with the...  You know,  you had all the loads  on your face.  It sort of looked like  there was a giant jellyfish,  like,  taped to your face.  It was so much calm on there.  What I would love to do...  We'd get it.  Yeah, exactly.  Choke you with my cock 
[01:48:30]  and throw you  through my window.  Are you in this now?  All right, mom.  What?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Thank you, Bob.  I'm going to go with no.  Thank you.  That would not...  But I want to say,  actually,  if you want to see  more of that kind of thing,  actually,  this is...  I've only done  really one rough scene  and it was, you know,  the facial abuse one,  but I literally just filmed  a threesome  with me  and two other guys  where I'm wearing a collar  and I'm wearing  handcuffs  and the scene's  coming out soon.  It's for my  movie, 
[01:49:00]  my new movie,  but...  What's it called?  You are all over the place.  You guys need to watch it.  It's so fucking kinky.  But what's the movie called?  It's called  Real College Girls.  You don't have to tell me.  And you are a real college girl.  Well, watch it.  Well, young lady,  I think you got  your third year paid off now.  Yes.  I'll try.  And you have a place  to stay in New York.  Oh.  I won't even be there.  I'll just let you  have my apartment.  We got Lady Diah  walking down the hall.  I think she wants  to ask us one question  as we wrap up  the interview with Belle Knox.  She's someone we've known  for many years 
[01:49:30]  and she's our intern  this week.  How many scenes  have you filmed  to date there, Belle?  Okay.  I'd say probably  anywhere from 25 to 30 scenes.  And about...  How much do you get per...  Yeah.  You know,  it really changes  the more that you're  willing to do.  So I get  between like  1,200  to 1,500.  And guys...  Yeah, the guys I think  probably make a lot less...  I think they make  800.  I'm not really sure  what they make.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  What are you...  Di, you're talking.  We're doing something.  You're yapping into the radio.  What are you doing?  Come on.  Poor lady, Di.  Don't be alarmed.  Don't be alarmed.  Would you ever get like...  You would get like  a phone sex thing  where people pay  X amount of an hour  for a minute to talk to you.  Oh my God, I'd love to.  You could just talk  about white male privilege  and guys could jack off.  Your white male privilege  totally turns me on.  No, like I can totally 
[01:50:30]  do the whole phone sex thing.  But sometimes guys  get super corny.  Okay, the...  This one time  I was hooking up  with this guy  and he was about to...  He was rubbing my pussy  or whatever.  We were doing foreplay  and I said...  I said,  talk dirty to me.  And he goes,  uh...  How often do you  shave your vagina?  Oh, that's not...  Very hot.  Ask a logistical question.  Sounds like something  a physician would ask.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, did you hit  any traffic on I-80?  So what did you say? 
[01:51:00]  I was like,  uh...  I have to go.  No, I was just like,  uh...  Like every day.  Now, your lips are big  and long  or are they thick and long?  They're thick and long  and when I thought  I was younger,  I thought there was  something wrong with it.  They're so big, but...  No.  Jeez.  They're just more fun  to play with.  Yeah, I think that's  really a great quality  in a person.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good.  It's a quality  of my personality, really.  Did you put that  on your Duke application essay?  I did.  Humongous pussy lips.  Good.  Ugh! 
[01:51:30]  God, she's the best!  Nothing makes me happier.  Can you, like,  not wear certain thongs  because they kind of  bulge out in me?  Yeah, actually,  that's totally true.  And when I, like,  vibrate...  Even bigger.  See, I like that.  I like when you...  Like, if I'm just  kind of talking to a girl  and you can't just say,  like, do you have  big pussy lips?  So I'll ask, like,  well, do you wear, like,  thongs?  Bee curtains.  No, I would love  to just say that,  but you can't.  So I'll be like,  well, do you wear  white thongs?  And they're like,  well, no, I can't.  And I'm like, oh...  Why can't you just say that?  Just be like, yo, bitch,  do you have...  Don't say bitch, sorry. 
[01:52:00]  No, but I understand  what you mean.  And in a perfect world,  you're right.  Bitch is not respectful  to women.  Don't say bossy, either.  Bad bossy.  Most women,  if you say,  are you a pussy this big,  they won't answer you.  Believe me,  in your world,  I wish I could say that.  Are you a squirter, Belle?  I've squirted, like,  twice in my life.  And it was in, like,  the parking lot  of an amusement park.  Wow.  Fun rights.  Action park?  Yeah.  No, it was this, like,  place in Idaho  called Silverwood.  From fucking  or for oral sex? 
[01:52:30]  No, he just, like,  put his finger inside me  and, like, tapped,  you know,  it's where, like,  you put your finger inside  and you just tap.  Yeah, a little Morse code  right there.  Yeah, and then...  You squirted in this car?  Yeah, I squirted  all over his car.  Oh, that's so fucking great.  I've had a girl squirt  in my mouth  while I was, like,  sucking another guy's dick.  Ooh!  Wow.  Yeah.  Man.  And this was just...  Was she another dick student?  No, she was...  It was, like,  my scene with, like,  James Dean.  Oh, it was a scene.  Okay, I was like,  whoa, is that just  hanging out?  Girls love him. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  You know what he does?  That's just, like, amazing.  He...  Well, I had this, like,  chemistry with him  and then...  He was already amazing.  We talked about feminism  and he was just  this really great guy.  We get on set.  There's, like,  six people around us  and he whispers in my ear  about how he wants  to take me home  and make me his sex slave.  Like, that's what he does.  Like, he's just incredible.  So you enjoyed him?  Yeah.  He's, like,  seriously,  I would marry him.  He's amazing.  Yeah, women...  He's, like,  the hottest...  Like, the biggest male porn star. 
[01:53:30]  But you know what he did to you?  I mean, that's the key for guys  is if they sexualize it immediately,  women find that confident  and attractive.  I bet if the dorky frat guy  had sexualized it immediately,  you would have thought  he was a lot hotter.  That guy didn't have  a fucking chance in hell.  Yeah, exactly.  She likes James Dean.  That fucking guy  has no shot at all  with his dumb fucking backpack.  I've had guys say that to me before.  They're, like...  Guys who want to hook up with me,  they're, like,  I don't know if I can compare  to James Dean.  I'm, like,  well, you can't, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you banged anybody  who's better than him?  Um, no. 
[01:54:00]  Or a bigger dick?  I think that...  Well, I mean,  I probably, yeah,  I banged a guy  who had, like,  an 11-inch dick.  Jesus.  For a scene, yeah.  Oh, I saw that one.  My, yeah.  Yeah, that was one  you were wearing  the crotchless thingy?  Yeah, they, like...  Yeah.  He, like,  ripped over the same thing.  Yeah, that was a good one.  But, I mean,  James is just...  He knows...  He's, like,  a natural dom  and I'm a natural sub  in sex,  so it just was, like,  this perfect synergy.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  What do you want to ask, Di?  Di, what do you want to ask?  I'm uncomfortable.  Into the mic, Di. 
[01:54:30]  I don't know what's going on.  Into the mic.  Hold on.  Can I explain?  Belle, that's Lady Di.  She's a paid intern this week.  Yes, she's working here.  She also...  Just this week?  Just this week.  Just when we can't deal with her.  We've known her for probably...  And she's also a squirter.  She's been squirting out her asshole  all morning.  She has a bit of the runs.  She has the runs this morning.  Oh, you're okay.  Okay.  For now.  I'm all right.  Do you know who Belle Knox is, Lady Di?  I've had the runs before.  Okay.  Do you know who...  How do you like being a porn star?  That's a good question.  That's a good question. 
[01:55:00]  I love, love, love being a porn star.  I love my job.  That's good.  Yeah.  Anything else, Lady Di?  It's good to do that.  Yeah, I do get paid.  Are you thinking of going into the business?  Maybe, uh...  If she's getting $1,200, $1,500 a scene,  you would probably get $27 a scene.  Hey, ONA, do you remember that girl?  That was a bomb.  I remember her.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  Well, you know...  Oh, Big Mindy.  Yeah, she did.  She's a big girl porn.  You remember that.  There was a magazine called Big Butt Magazine, I think?  Yeah.  And she was a model. 
[01:55:30]  I love Big Butts.  She was a model in there.  She was a friend of ours for a while.  For men or women or both?  Oh, women.  I love girls with curves, and I love girls with, like, big, amazing butts.  Are you able to make...  We were talking about when you did my podcast, I was telling you about how I finger-fucked  a girl to orgasm because you were questioning me.  Yeah, you made me a little wet.  So have you done that?  Have you made women cum?  Never.  Um...  Oh, Jimmy.  I'll take my makeup.  I mean...  I mean, yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Like, that's the beauty of hooking up with a girl.  They know...  Like, I hate when a guy is, like, rubbing my pussy and he just rubs the lips.  No.  No, dude.  That's not what I'm getting at.  What's that about?  There's something called a clit, and it's there for a reason.  And, I mean...  Yeah.  I mean, like, I know what a girl likes.  I try my best, I guess.  If you're a guy and your neck muscles and wrists aren't hurting you when she comes, you're  not doing it right.  You gotta fucking get in there like you're trying to change spark plugs on a Toyota.  Fucking dive right in! 
[01:56:30]  A simple trick I like, and it doesn't even take that much, I guess, strain, is just put  my clit in your mouth and just kind of suck on it.  Like, literally just suck on it.  How do you feel about spelling out the alphabet on someone?  Oh, God.  Oh, that's cool.  That's a Kinison bit, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's cool.  I don't go for that at all.  Like, what I'll do is I'll lick the clit for like, oh, maybe ten seconds, and then I  get tired, and I have to relax.  You sound a little selfish.  Oh, no, not at all.  I won't let the girl suck my dick for more than ten seconds, either. 
[01:57:00]  For girls below me, I go, let's just stop.  I want to talk to you about a couple of things.  You time it.  You like, put it on the timer.  Laney?  Yes.  Oh.  You called her Laney?  That's Laney.  She's Laney.  That's Laney, to your right.  You get paid good to do that, right?  You already asked that.  You asked that already.  You forgot you asked that, probably.  I do, yeah.  What about another question?  Just a real question.  Lady Di, do you like to get face fucked?  I don't know.  It's been such a long time for me. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah?  I have no idea what I like anymore.  You should try.  Spice it up.  I haven't found Mr. Right yet.  Mr. Right.  Oh, you don't need Mr. Right.  You just need Mr. Right now.  Oh, there you go.  I didn't find that person yet.  That's okay.  Yes, I did.  All right, let me go to the phone.  You're looking at him right now, right?  Oh, boy.  Jimmy Norton.  Oh.  Jimmy Norton.  I sure am.  Daniel.  Daniel in PA.  I'm going to fucking shoot her.  That's the best.  That's the best.  Go ahead, Daniel.  Yes.  Okay.  I wanted to know if tomorrow your parents, Bill, said, okay, we're going to pay for every 
[01:58:00]  single day of your school and you're never, like, it's all taken care of, but you have  to quit the porn, what would you do?  I don't have headphones.  That's a good question.  Answer.  That is actually a good question.  I think that, you know, porn is really, really something I genuinely do, I do genuinely really  enjoy doing.  And I think that if I kind of just stop doing it, I've had times where I, you know, I didn't 
[01:58:30]  do it for months because I was at school and I miss it.  I missed, you know, the world.  I missed, you know, being around the people.  So I probably would just kind of scale back on how much porn I did.  But, I mean, absolutely, if, you know, my parents were, like, you know, so, so, so uncomfortable  with me stopping, I would probably consider, you know, quitting.  How did you, okay, can I ask one more question?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right, before you started officially doing porn, how many times a week were you having 
[01:59:00]  sex?  Um, I actually wasn't having that much sex because I didn't, like, I was in college, I  didn't have a boyfriend.  Um, so probably, like, once or twice a week.  How many times a day do you masturbate?  Um, twice, three times?  Uh, I have to schedule it around when my roommate's gone, which sucks.  Why?  Are you loud?  I can't masturbate with my roommate in the room.  I can masturbate with my parents sitting shiva in the next room and they're not even Jewish. 
[01:59:30]  They're Catholic.  Do you get along with your roommate?  Yeah, we're, like, we're literally, like, best friends.  Pretty close?  Yeah, she's amazing.  How did your parents think you were paying for college?  Because there was a time...  That's actually a really funny story.  Oh, I thought you were going to say a really good question.  Damn it!  Funny story.  Funny story.  It's not a good question.  Lady Di's got good questions.  Yes.  I'm from a state where, uh, weed is legal.  Nice.  Um, so I simply implied to, um, my parents that I was selling weed to pay for school. 
[02:00:00]  Perfect.  So, uh, yeah.  Okay.  Lady Di, anything on that?  Uh, no.  Not really.  Okay.  All right.  No other questions, Lady Di?  She's, she's, she's...  She's a porn star.  She's a porn star.  How do you keep your weight down?  What'd she say?  How do you keep your weight down?  That's a fair question.  That's cool.  That's a good question.  Uh, I mean, I, I haven't really had time lately, because I've been super busy, like...  By not swallowing, Lady Di, something you might not. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, Lady Di.  That's actually a good question.  Do you, that has no calories?  Do you like the taste of semen?  Um, I do, actually.  How do you know?  It just, I do, but it depends on the guy.  I mean, if the guy tastes really bad, then it's just, like, a horrible experience.  But to answer her question, um, I work out, like, a couple hours a day, you know.  Jesus.  In the, in the summer, I work out, like, all the time.  Um, but, I mean, I, I don't know. 
[02:01:00]  Like, I honestly eat whatever I want.  Like, I don't know how I...  No, listen, Lady Di, it's called being 18 years old.  She's a young guy, too.  It's a lot easier.  I was, I was, I was thin when I was 18, too.  Oh, yeah?  Also, yes, I was.  You look wonderful now, too.  Oh, that's very sweet.  I, no, I couldn't look up better than this.  You should be a politician, Bill.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're really good.  You'd, you deadpan that.  It was perfect.  I could look up better than this.  Yeah.  What is she, uh, oh.  What's the most money you ever made? 
[02:01:30]  What's this money thing?  Uh, the most money I ever made, uh, I think I made, uh, $2,300 in one day.  Ooh, that's great.  How many scenes?  Um, I did a scene with a girl, and it was super easy.  We just kind of, like, vibrated each other.  And then, um, it was the scene where I did that threesome with the two guys.  Who's on your no list?  Um, who's on my no list?  Um...  Everyone in this room...  Jamie Norton. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, that's a good question.  Um...  Uh...  Hmm.  Well, am I on your no list?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  No, of course you're not on my no list.  You don't have to be nice.  Amazing.  She's a monster.  You don't have to be that nice.  Tremendous.  Yeah, and you've done a few scenes, but there's got to be some guys that you're like, no.  Um, well...  You just turned down someone.  You can't talk about that?  But if I know...  I'll just say this.  If I know that the person outside of work is engaging in...  Hold on.  You're on the phone. 
[02:02:30]  We're on the air.  On the phone.  You're talking to a microphone.  I'm talking to Sam.  I know that, but it's going through the fucking microphone.  What do you think?  The microphone knows you're talking to Sam?  Holy shit.  I guess so.  You're holding an instrument that projects your voice.  I love you, but...  I know what I'm holding.  I know, but now you're talking...  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry, Belle.  It's okay.  Belle Knox.  As I was saying, if I...  Yes, please.  If I know that somebody is engaging in unsafe behavior outside of work, then I won't work with them.  Oh, okay. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  She found out this person might have been doing a little stuff on the side that's not good.  I mean, if they're fucking, you know, an IV drug user, I'm going to, you know, err on  the side of caution and not work with them.  But I haven't really had that issue, you know?  I really haven't, so...  Belle?  Excuse me, Belle?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Oh, she takes her glasses off.  How often do you get paid?  Enough with the paid.  Sorry, Belle.  Everyone is so curious about that.  Belle, if you're looking for a business manager, I think... 
[02:03:30]  Oh, boy.  Absolutely.  I always just get the money first.  We have a guy that might have went to college with you.  Yes, and Belle's at headquarters tonight, by the way.  Wait, and he's talking, so he wants to talk to me right now?  Yeah, let me see.  He's excited.  Do you know a Maury?  I feel like this is going to be some trolling asshole.  It might.  Maury, yes.  Do you have to handle it?  It might.  Okay.  Do you have a wig store?  You're the troll slayer, Belle.  Okay, what do you have to say?  Maury in Queens.  Hey, Belle, I was going to get some Danish for Belle.  Hey, did you hear about the point chase people doing up in Boston?  Yeah, me and Goonzie. 
[02:04:00]  I'm sorry.  What did you just say?  I don't even know.  He wasn't even good at it.  I couldn't hear what he said.  He couldn't understand what he said.  And we don't even, I mean, if he's trying to do something, that's fine, but I don't even  know what he was doing.  It sounded like he was getting face fucked or something.  I don't even know what he was doing.  I don't even know what he was doing.  I don't even know what he was doing.  I don't even know what he was doing or something like fake throwing up.  Yeah, he went like, I don't know what that was.  Have you ever, we were talking also, you said you've never had such a rough blowjob that you've  thrown up, right?  Yeah, I have a really strong gag reflex.  Nice.  Like, even if, like, you know, I try, I've just experimented.  Even if I try to make myself throw up, I can't. 
[02:04:30]  Wow.  And as you see in the facial abuse video, they tried so hard to make me throw up, and I  just, like, I was like, it's not happening.  But how do you not, like, I always, I don't like blowjobs like that because I'm always scared  I'm going to get bitten.  Like, how do you not get bitten?  What do you mean, get bitten?  How do you not die?  Jimmy's really fantasizing now.  Yeah, yes, I've dated a variety of young ladies.  I'm not perfect.  Excuse me, Belle?  I bite sometimes on accident.  Oh, you do?  And sometimes they like the little teeth sensation. 
[02:05:00]  I'm not perfect, I bite.  Like, I'm just like every other person, you know?  Excuse me, Belle?  Oh, boy.  I just threw up in the sink.  She did, by the way, she did.  I got a little bit sick and I threw up in the sink.  You need to go home, dude.  You need to go home, dude.  You're right on everything you just said.  Are you okay?  Number two is coming.  Oh, Jesus.  She has the runs and she's puking in the sink.  Is she going to get me sick?  No, no, no.  It's nothing you can catch. 
[02:05:30]  It's alcoholism.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't think you can catch alcoholism.  Yeah, she's like a party streamer out of both holes.  Yeah, well, I went to TGIF's yesterday.  All right, she doesn't care.  Uh, Belle, someone saying your weed store.  Oh, my good.  Thank God.  I don't want to hear it from the 18-year-old porn star.  I want to hear about your breakfast.  From the monster.  Exactly.  Belle.  Put mustard or mayo on it.  Sorry, I hope I just can't get through without hearing the rest of the story.  Belle, someone saying your weed story doesn't match up because weed just became legal.  That's what I just said.  It was legal.  No, it just became legal. 
[02:06:00]  Also, you...  They don't know anything.  It just becomes legal, but she just...  No, it was legal.  It's been legal in Washington since last June.  Yeah.  Okay, so that's why I'm bringing it up.  He was confused by your weed story.  He didn't...  What does he mean?  It just became legal.  He's probably thinking you're from Colorado.  No, no.  We just became legal.  I'm not from Colorado.  He's trying to chip you up.  It's out there where you're from, right?  Yeah, I'm from Washington State.  Yeah.  Seattle area?  Or you don't want to say?  Love Seattle.  I'm in an area in Washington. 
[02:06:30]  The great Pacific Northwest.  Yeah, it's freaking cold, but it's so beautiful.  I love it there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's fucking cold here.  But, you know, it gets warmer in the summer, and I do have a pool.  Yeah, because no...  Hold on.  Let me help you out, because Anthony has a really nice pool.  Believe me, no porn guys in L.A. have a jacuzzi.  Anthony has a jacuzzi.  I'm trying to prepare you to your pool, Anthony.  Me and Marion.  Oh, yeah, you and Marion.  That's exactly what I wanted.  I guess Anthony has the runs right now. 
[02:07:00]  I don't know how you're in my pool.  Exactly.  Belle can't make it, but she can shit and vomit into your pool if you like it.  No.  Come on.  No, I wouldn't like it.  Thank you very much.  Does it take someone off your no list if they have a jacuzzi?  Does that help them get off your no list?  Probably, yeah.  They come in my side.  Hold on a second.  What comes in her size?  She just said, I could buy a swimsuit.  A swimsuit.  How awful is that?  In my size.  And a bathing cap. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What year is it?  What is this?  One of those old lady bathing caps.  What is this?  1905?  I don't need a bathing cap.  How about an astronaut outfit?  All right.  Okay, to answer your question, I'm not like a gold digger.  You know what I mean?  What was the question?  I didn't hear the question.  She said, if a guy has a jacuzzi, does it make you want to sleep with him?  No.  I was trying to help you out.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, yeah, totally.  I mean, like, if, you know, it's like, okay, cool, you have money, but, like, if you're  going to be waving it in my face, like, I don't want to talk to you. 
[02:08:00]  Have you gotten weird, like, guys thinking that their money would get you, get them somewhere  with you?  Uh, yeah.  What happened?  Yeah, um, I've had just guys say, say stuff like, oh, my daddy will pay for it, or, or,  like, daddy's credit card's going to pay for it.  About themselves?  Yeah.  Uh, do you, do they take taxes out of your check?  What the fuck?  These things are headwind and she's auditing you right now.  She works for the IRS. 
[02:08:30]  Uh, yes.  Porn is a legal and regulated profession.  Oh, my God.  And I do have to pay taxes, just like everybody else, because the government loves stealing  money from people.  Wait, where are you shooting, too?  She's a libertarian.  Did you know that?  Yeah.  Where are you shooting?  Because in L.A., they're making, they're trying to do this whole thing with goggles, and you  have to wear, uh, you have to wear condoms now.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  They just did that to get them out of L.A.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  So, yeah, they want that.  They want people to wear goggles for, yeah.  It's not what you wear.  They just want them out of L.A.  That looks silly.  Uh, I mean, I shoot in L.A., I shoot in Porn Valley, um. 
[02:09:00]  How do you get away with it without condoms?  How do you do, how do you know condom shoes there?  I mean, was that measure even, you do realize that it's a completely unforceable measure.  Like, you can't tell, you can't literally regulate people to wear condoms, nor should you  have the power to be able to.  But they passed it.  They did pass it, and I think 90-something percent of the business left that area, and  they were going to start shooting.  Well, that's true.  A lot of people did actually, uh, leave for Las Vegas.  But I will say this, um, when I get on set, um, I, I, I've had a lot of, uh, people I've 
[02:09:30]  worked with who say, do you want to wear, do you want to use condoms?  So a lot of the times, I have the choice.  Guys, offer?  Bell?  If I want to use a condom, I can use a condom.  Excuse me, Bell?  Yes.  Okay.  Are you allergic to condoms?  Because I know I am.  Um, actually, I have a condom fetish.  We believe you.  Was that?  I have a condom fetish.  You like that?  A condom fetish?  What's that about?  Do you like to see an older gentleman losing his erection in a condom?  Because I can help out with that.  No, but, what I like is after a guy, like, fucks me, and he comes in the condom, I like, 
[02:10:00]  like, just seeing the cum just, like, all in there, and it's like, oh my god, you came  so much.  Like, I love when a guy, like, halfway fills the condom, and it's like, wow, that's really  freaking hot.  Yeah, huh?  Like, I'll just, like, after he fucks me, I'll just be like, can you just, like, stay  there for a second so I can just, like, look at it?  Do you like where the condom hangs off kind of heavy?  Yeah, because, oh god.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm a cum slut, yeah.  That is great.  I gotta say, you're pretty cool.  She's pretty cool.  She's awesome. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  And the slut-shaming I hold a story.  What cock-blockers.  What magazines are you in, Belle?  Her face is just like, what is this?  Well, um.  She's in National Geographic, by the way.  Yes.  You're shooting some stuff, aren't you?  I'm not in any magazines right now, but I actually, I have done a few shoots for magazines,  and I've done interviews for magazines, so they should be out soon.  I have a movie coming out, like I talked about, called Real College Girls, so you can catch 
[02:11:00]  me in that, um, so yeah.  That's my life.  And of course, the, uh, pocket pussy and the, uh, asshole in mouth.  Uh, yeah.  Well, also, um, I'm going to be working with Pornhub, which is literally, like, my favorite  porn site ever.  Um, and I'm, I'm like the top girl on there right now, which is super cool, but, um, they're  going to, like, let me intern for them.  Really?  Which beats the hell out of anything that I was going to do this summer anyway.  They get her for an intern, and we get, uh, Lady Di.  Yeah, exactly.  That really shows you.  Excuse me, Belle? 
[02:11:30]  Yes?  Can, can we find your movies at Blockbuster?  Yeah, I mean.  Blockbuster?  Wait, does Blockbuster even exist anymore?  No, it doesn't.  I think there might be one store left.  I remember the Palmer Video used to have a through the Lex section a long time ago.  I don't know if Blockbuster.  Palmer Video?  I feel like they've done.  Palmer Video, yeah, a long time ago.  They used to have, like, a special section for adults.  Oh, would you go back there and check out some films, Lady Di?  Behind the beaded door?  Sure, why not?  Why not, right?  What's your favorite porn flick?  What's my favorite way to...  Like, what's your genre?  What kind of...  I haven't seen them in a while.  But what do you like seeing as far as porn goes? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, boy.  The first thing that comes to my mind is Deep Throat.  Oh, God.  We're Soul Sisters.  That's the first thing that comes to my mind.  The other movies, I don't know.  Or Polar Opposites.  It's one or the other.  You know, I feel like I'm going to be sick again.  Now?  No.  Do you like when a guy...  Because Belle likes when a guy puts his penis way deep into her throat.  Okay, finish coughing before I ask the blowjob question.  What?  Um, Belle likes when a guy puts his dick all the way into her throat. 
[02:12:30]  Do you like that?  Sorry, Belle.  Not now.  Do you like when a guy comes, like, deep in your throat and you choke on his cum?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Come on.  Did I answer a question?  That's a good question.  When a guy fucks your throat so deep...  When I feel okay...  Microphone.  When I feel okay, yes.  But when I feel a little nauseous, no.  How do you feel now?  What does that mean?  I'm all right now, you know.  What does that even mean?  I hope you feel better, honestly.  Maybe you should go home.  I hope I feel better, too.  Like...  So does anyone...  Does anyone have a shot with you in New York or no, because your dad is here with you? 
[02:13:00]  If I go home, I'm not going to get paid.  Okay, hold on about the money.  We're asking...  Mandy has a really important question here.  We're all waiting for the answer to you.  I'm trying to stick it out today.  You know?  To clarify, my father is not following me to any porn shoots.  My father is not following me to go strip, and I'm not doing any shoots in New York.  He's here because he loves you.  He's here because he loves me, and he's here to moral, you know, support me and to show  me I'm not alone, but...  Has he...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Has he said to you, like, hey, you don't have to do...  Like, has he said to you, like, look, there's other options, or is he just trying to hang 
[02:13:30]  loose and see what you want to do?  He's made it clear to me that he doesn't necessarily agree with what I'm doing, but he's my father,  and he loves me, and he supports me.  Okay, well, and you're 18, and you can't do what you want, I mean, there's nothing  he can do about it.  Yeah, I mean, he doesn't personally, like, necessarily agree with, you know, pornography  or whatever, but, um, yeah.  I mean, but he's also, you know, said to me before that he, you know, he knows how hard  it is to be in student loan debt.  Has anybody who's been critical of you also been creepy with you? 
[02:14:00]  Uh, yeah, actually, I've had a lot of people make comments to me that insinuate rape or  sexual assault.  There was actually a forum that was started about me that was, um, freshman porn star,  and then the tagline was, if you banged her, report in.  And they said, um, a couple, a couple comments were, um, I like to see her, uh, raped and  spit on.  Yeah, that's how, yeah.  Yeah.  So.  And then that other site said, um, yeah, they're just awful, awful things. 
[02:14:30]  I will say, people say that porn is degrading.  I have felt more degraded by the, my critics, by people, you know, implying I should be raped,  implying that I should be kicked out of school.  I felt more degraded by them than I've ever, ever felt doing porn.  And she's such a badass on Dr. Drew.  She made one of her critics who they had ambushed her with.  Right.  And they were going to surprise her with this woman who's been like a total cunt to her  on Twitter.  Okay.  She said she was going to walk off unless the woman left and she got the woman to leave.  Oh, that's awesome. 
[02:15:00]  Excuse me.  This lady hates porn.  She talks.  Excuse me, Belle.  What?  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  Well, you kind of did.  How did your dad make?  Uh, that's, I feel like that's, uh, um.  That's personal.  With all due respect, I think that's a very kind of rude question to ask.  And that's personal.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  It's cool, man.  But, uh, I mean, as I was saying.  Yes, as you were saying.  What was I talking about?  You were talking about that woman that, uh.  Oh, yeah.  So this girl, she hates pornography if she says it's degrading.  How old is she?  She's like 40.  But that's totally fine. 
[02:15:30]  You can totally believe that.  I go on her Twitter profile.  This girl hosts for Playboy Radio.  Ah, boy.  You don't get to host for Playboy Radio and then talk shit about porn.  Yeah.  Why is she doing that?  What does she think?  Because she's a hypocrite.  Oh, yeah.  Because she's doing the media strategy of feuding up.  She's getting her name attached to you while you're in the news.  But she's also insulting probably half of the girls who work for Playboy Radio.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But I love that you made her leave.  No, I literally said it. 
[02:16:00]  I was like, this is bullshit.  You're pissing me off.  You shouldn't have had her come on.  She's been rude to me.  What's her name?  Who was she?  Uh, I don't even want to give her the publicity of saying her name.  She doesn't deserve that.  What's her first name?  No.  Yeah, she's just, uh...  I'm just trying to think of someone we know.  She's like, she just, like, goes on Dr. Drew sometimes.  And she's like...  Enough of Dr. Drew.  Fake therapist.  For real.  Is it J.H.?  I think Dr. Drew should apologize to you.  He needs to apologize.  And, um...  Yeah.  Quite honestly, telling...  Advising somebody to kill themselves, that's kind of grounds to, like, you know, maybe lose 
[02:16:30]  your license a little bit.  I would go that far.  Hold on.  You gotta take it out of a grain of salt.  Like, sometimes people...  There's this common vernacular we have that people say stuff.  And, you know, he didn't mean that literally.  Like, we have to sometimes realize that people say shitty things, but they're not being literal.  It was so incredibly offensive on so many levels because he's not...  Excuse me, Belle?  Yes?  Okay.  Um, uh, do you have HBO?  Because I can't afford it.  HBO.  What is...  I wish I had HBO.  I really like the shows on there, actually.  Yes.  Game of Thrones? 
[02:17:00]  Game of Thrones.  No.  Boardwalk Empire?  She's in Game of Thrones.  She plays Winterfell.  Oh, you do?  I don't know.  I can't follow Game of Thrones.  What's your favorite porno?  My favorite porno?  Is it Deep Throne?  Um, no.  I mean, I don't watch videos, but my favorite porn star...  I watch this shit online, but my favorite porn star is Sasha Gray.  Excuse me, Belle.  Oh.  I met Ron Jeremy.  Oh, yeah.  He followed me on Twitter.  Of course he did.  I guess he follows me, too.  I have no idea.  Would you have sex with Ron Jeremy?  They had some kind of a signing at Bayway Liquors, and Marion and I went over there... 
[02:17:30]  She doesn't know who Marion is.  You're saying Marion like it's Michelle Obama.  She doesn't know who Marion...  Marion's her obnoxious fat friend from Long Island.  She doesn't know her.  Hey, hey.  She says hi to all of you.  I get him my best.  I love Marion.  We're doing a radio show now.  That's great.  No, we met him at Bayway Liquors.  Thank you.  Does Ron Jeremy have a shot with you, now that he's followed you on Twitter?  Um, I just don't think I'm interested in the genre that he, um, kind of does. 
[02:18:00]  He seems like...  I've heard he's a great guy.  Paraporn.  He's old school.  He's an old school guy.  Old school guy.  I know.  He has a big dick.  I know that.  Wow.  I've seen it.  Oh, Lady Di.  I had a threesome with him, so, you know.  Did he really?  Yeah.  How was it?  It was for...  Was there any crossing swords or...  No, no, no.  She just gave me a head while Ron...  The DP?  He used to put whipped cream on a stick and have the girl lick it off.  He used to make a porn movie.  That sounds like an incentive.  Yeah.  That was some cock-locking right there.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:18:30]  I saw that.  What's this choker?  In common discussion?  Do you know, I would put a thing in the Florida,  open, and that part of the sofa would just fall through it  into the basement for a few minutes.  Jimmy wants a choker.  We're having a nice, sexy chat about my threesome,  and she jumps in with fucking...  You know, sometimes he'll have, like,  a little bit of egg salad spread out of his asshole,  and somebody will lick it out.  There was some bonding going on there.  A little bit.  I used to see these movies in motels.  Of course you did.  In motels.  In motels. 
[02:19:00]  Right, right.  Of all the guys in this room,  who would you fuck first?  Who would I fuck first?  Yeah.  All right, Diana.  She's still talking to Lainey on the sofa.  I turned her mic off.  I would fuck...  I don't...  You.  I'd fuck you.  Yeah!  The opster!  Congratulations, puppy.  The opster.  I like your hair.  Your hair's really cute.  Really?  But what about...  What about Jim?  Come on.  Well, wait.  To clarify that,  I'd fuck you first.  What am I talking about?  Oh, man.  Mandy is a blonde, 
[02:19:30]  and so is...  Yeah, yeah.  You're fucking hot, Mandy.  And you're sexy,  and your life is like Sex in the City,  and I'm jealous.  Excuse me.  Thanks.  How much does Ron Jeremy make?  I think he makes a lot of money, actually.  I'm sure his rate is super high.  Oh, wait, wait.  I have another question.  Oh.  How come he had...  How come he had to promote his rum that was coming out  and, you know, be at Bayway Liquors?  What the fuck?  She wouldn't know that.  She would have free t-shirts.  No, no, hold on.  I'm sure Belle has...  I don't know.  We've been wondering about the Bayway Liquors 
[02:20:00]  personal appearance in 1997.  Would you know that way?  We're going to get Belle Knox on our show  when you're asking that question.  I was Ron Jeremy's personal manager.  Right.  I was going to say that.  I got to ask you about your...  Not fascination, whatever it is,  with Amanda Knox.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  I forgot about that.  Hence the Knox part of your name.  Yeah, you know what?  I actually...  I really...  Sometimes I just hear about these cases,  like the JonBenet Ramsey case.  Uh-huh.  Or, you know, these cases I get really fascinated with. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  And I'll read all the evidence,  and then I'll kind of form my own opinion.  And Amanda Knox, that whole case,  just really, really fascinates me.  And I do think...  I don't think she's innocent.  I think that there's something else totally going on.  Yeah, there was some shenanigans going on there.  In my personal opinion,  I think that her behavior after, you know,  the day after she's doing cartwheels,  I think she should have just admitted from the get-go  that she was probably high as fuck  when all of that was happening.  What do you think she had to do with it?  Because I'm not 100% familiar with it. 
[02:21:00]  I think that the characterization of her  as like this, you know,  slut or foxy noxy  or this like promiscuous girl  is really off base.  But I think that something more...  something more happened.  I think she knew about stuff that was going on  more than she said.  She claims that she was at the house  and she heard something  but she covered her ear.  You know, I just think  that there was more going on.  But I do resent the media's characterization  of her as this like slut  or this foxy noxy  just because, you know, 
[02:21:30]  she wrote in her diary  that she fucked some guys on the train.  That's always what they'll do  to try to, you know,  make them look bad in court.  But she was fucking cute.  Yeah, she's hot.  That's why, yeah,  that's why people are fasting.  That goes a long way.  She's hot.  She's gorgeous.  That goes a long way.  And she's so...  She's intelligent.  And I think...  I actually...  I think people are offended actually.  I've gotten some tweets saying  how dare you, you know,  name yourself after a murderer.  I just think she's a fascinating person.  You know?  Yeah, and besides,  people are fascinated with her  and interested in her  so why is that any worse than... 
[02:22:00]  Why any better than...  It's like Marilyn Manson, you know?  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like that...  the cute bell  and then the dark...  Yes.  Bell, of course, from Disney.  But I wouldn't have known that.  I'm not allowed to talk...  I'm probably not allowed  to talk about that.  Probably not.  You haven't gotten  the Disney endorsement yet?  I don't think I...  The C&D will come in soon,  I'm sure.  I wanted to do a shoot  at Disneyland  but that was...  that was quickly knocked...  Oh, man.  They do not...  That was mixed off the table. 
[02:22:30]  They do not want...  You were going to do it  and then just say,  hey, this was at Disneyland?  No, I mean,  I was just going to do  like a little photo shoot  at Disneyland  but, yeah,  I don't think they'd like  that very much.  Yeah, they're really weird  with that stuff.  They have a whole thing of us.  They have an image to keep up  and that's totally cool.  Yeah.  They try to be all wholesome.  Yeah, that's their thing.  This was awesome.  You're great.  You're really honest.  Very forthcoming,  which is nice.  Tonight, headquarters,  let's plug her gig properly,  552 West 38th Street  and Belle's dancing  for the first time 
[02:23:00]  and she's super sexy.  That would be cool.  Throw money at me, guys.  Yeah.  I want somebody  to like throw  just like bands  that make me dance, guys.  Just go at it.  Are you a good dancer  or are you just kidding?  I'm not a particularly  good dancer.  I mean, I'm good at like,  you know,  just kind of dancing  and getting my groove.  That sounded so like  old person-ish  but, yeah.  Yeah, but we all  are related to it.  You're going to try  to work the pole at all?  I don't think  there is a pole, actually.  No?  At headquarters?  Should be a pole.  Yeah.  Excuse me, Belle.  Throw money at me, guys. 
[02:23:30]  You're a good dancer.  I've seen you move.  Do you think  coffee coladas  make you go to the bathroom?  Jesus Christ.  All right, Lady Di.  Thank you.  That's about enough out of her.  Belle, Belle, just one more question.  I think that's actually  a fair question.  No, I'm just wondering.  You know,  certain things make you go.  Okay, I was wondering  something else.  Do you think a woman like me  could make it in porn?  I think that porn  has a place for women  of every shape and size.  You know, I'm going to...  Color.  And I think you're  wonderfully gorgeous.  Wow.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:24:00]  I think anybody  has a place in porn.  And I...  You know what?  I will say this.  I have never heard  of a girl...  I've never heard  of any of my friends  being told to lose  or gain any weight  because they are in porn.  Really?  And I have really small boobs  and I've been embraced  for having small boobs.  Oh, sure.  Don't ever get implants.  Excuse me,  do you have to do  all kinds of guys?  I pick.  I pick and choose  who I want to work with.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, uh...  I don't know.  Like, all kinds of guys.  You know what I mean.  How old were you  when you lost your virginity?  What would I mean?  I was 16. 
[02:24:30]  Okay.  Aw.  To who?  Uh, I...  I lost it to my boyfriend.  How old was he?  Uh, he was 17.  Okay.  And he's, uh, pretty...  Yeah, he's pretty tall, actually.  I was 18.  You're 18?  That's...  I was 16.  How old was the guy?  Oh, the guy, uh...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  He was in his 20s.  What kind of car?  Uh...  Huh?  Where was it?  Illegal.  What was that?  Where was it he had the sex?  Where was it that I had...  All right, you really want to know?  Yes.  In an abandoned building on a door. 
[02:25:00]  What?  I am very serious.  Did you get, like, a splinter?  It was great, right?  Hold on, that's the greatest answer.  In an abandoned building on a door?  On a door.  On a door.  What are you, a fucking spider?  How did you do it on a door?  Oh, I think it was off the hinges on the ground.  No, is that she just...  Yeah, she just, like, went against the door.  And just fell back.  That would be cool, too.  You could get...  The door was on the floor.  Fucked against the door.  And he laid you on the door in an abandoned building. 
[02:25:30]  This sounds like a good idea for a porno.  What a romantic.  Yeah.  How was it?  Ah.  It was, uh, different.  Why different?  Well, it was the first time, so of course it was different.  The doorknob was in her ass.  And, uh...  Oh, my God.  It hurt a little bit.  That's all right.  Of course it did.  Of course it did.  He was, uh...  He had a lot more, obviously, a lot more experience than me.  Why didn't he come to a nice motel?  Yeah, man, what's up with that?  Chivalry is dead, man.  Man, even back then.  16 years old. 
[02:26:00]  Do guys misinterpret you being really...  He was around maybe 10 years older than me.  Right.  Okay.  Wow, 26.  Maybe 24.  He was a creep, Di.  He was on creep.  I still know him.  All signs lead toward creep.  He was 26.  He takes a teenager into an abandoned building and fucks her on a door.  He's a creep.  Yeah.  He's a creep.  And Lady Di had some looks back in the day.  She had some looks.  I found that the warm way.  I've seen the old pictures.  Yeah, I used to look like that.  Can I ask a question about your breasts really quick?  And then I started to drink and then...  Ask me anything, ladies, or you guys. 
[02:26:30]  Obi, Anthony.  Yes.  So do you like any nipple play?  I hate when guys lick or kiss my nipples because it's like, why are you licking me?  But I love when a guy just kind of touches them because it's like, ooh.  But for me...  But what about, like, twerking your nipple or, like, rough nipple play?  Like...  The thing I really like...  Because if you're into S&M, like, do you like, like...  The clamps.  I've never played with...  I hate that.  All right.  The thing I like is... 
[02:27:00]  People, like, you know, twist your nipples and stuff.  That hurts.  I like getting, like, my belly button rubs.  Brilliant.  That I like.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you like it, Mandy?  Yeah, but I don't like really hard on my nipples.  It hurts too much.  You don't like kinky...  I have to hear the answer.  You don't like kinky things?  No, I don't like kinky things.  Okay, you're more of a traditionalist, actually.  Well, let's put it this way.  Okay.  I've been spanked, and I don't like that.  That's a kinky thing. 
[02:27:30]  Why were you spanked?  I was a bad girl.  For being a bad intern?  Bad intern.  No, we didn't go.  You like being spanked, right?  Yes, I do.  I don't like it.  If I intern for you guys and I fuck up, will you guys...  Even if you didn't.  Yeah.  Good, bad, or indifferent.  Just kidding.  That's sexual harassment.  You're going to spank him.  It's true.  And I would love their lawsuit against you for sexual harassment.  We'll role play that.  One more thing Lady Di doesn't like.  Yes, hold on.  One more second.  I don't like a guy watching me while I'm going to the bathroom. 
[02:28:00]  What?  When does that happen?  Nobody likes that.  Exactly.  Believe me.  Well, it happens on safari, I'm sure.  Lady Di...  Do you have a story about this?  Yeah, I kind of do.  All right.  What's the story?  You have to get through.  Let a red lady die.  I just don't like things like that.  But what's the story where you were in that position?  What's the story?  The story is, I don't like...  I know somebody that does these things, and I don't like that.  Just say the story! 
[02:28:30]  Right.  What's asking you?  She's here an hour, and she's already irritated with you.  What's the story?  Say the story.  It happened to me one time a while back.  What happened?  What happened?  The spanking, the pinching on the nipple...  No, the peeing.  No, the bathroom.  The people watching you.  Who's watching you?  Don't be going to the bathroom.  Who's watching you take a dump?  Don't tell the story.  Well, that's it.  That's the story.  No, who watched you take a dump?  Who went when we were once?  Well, it was something that I know, and it happened all in one day.  And he was trying to watch you do what?  Pee.  Where were you peeing?  In the bathroom. 
[02:29:00]  And he came in to watch?  Yeah.  Is this infuriating?  And did he ask you why you're not sitting down?  I was sitting down.  Oh, you are.  Okay.  I was sitting down.  If she ever goes to the police interrogation room, they would drive her.  She would drive them fucking nuts.  Like, so what were you doing today?  Uh, yeah.  They'd shoot her.  They'd get so frustrated.  I don't like kinky things.  Okay, we understand.  So what about, what about, like, pee?  Would you ever, would you ever pee on someone or let someone pee on you?  I mean, if a guy, like, really wanted to do it, I'd be like, cool with it.  But you've never done it?  Oh, I've never done it. 
[02:29:30]  But I have a friend, actually.  She's my best friend in porn, Caroline Ray.  Shout out to her.  She lives in New York.  Isn't she a comic?  Yeah, she's a comedian.  She was on, like, the Samantha the Witch show or something.  I don't, no.  Not Caroline Ray.  Caroline.  It's a different person.  Yeah, it's a different person.  Yeah, I would assume she's not doing porn.  She's my bestie in porn.  And she's really into piss.  Yeah.  But, uh...  Doing it or getting it done?  I'm not doing it.  Oh, actually.  She's really into piss.  So she's kind of opened my eyes to, like, why she likes it.  You know what I mean? 
[02:30:00]  But, uh, I mean, I think that if you like piss, like, more power to you.  It's awesome.  Whatever you're into.  Yeah.  I like a little piss sometimes.  Excuse me, Belle.  Yeah.  How much do you get for somebody peeing on you?  She doesn't.  She said she...  She hasn't do it.  I did it for free a long time ago.  You just said you didn't like piss play.  Yeah, what happened?  I don't.  I don't.  Where did you pee on?  Huh?  And was it on purpose?  God, lady, die is naughty.  It was on purpose.  Yeah, we had a...  She's naughty.  ...peeky thing going on.  What happened?  I just told you.  I peed.  Who and where? 
[02:30:30]  We peed on each other.  Where?  Where?  Was it on the door?  Huh?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Where did you pee on them?  Where?  Where did that happen?  It happened in New Jersey, obviously.  What?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't mean...  I don't know.  Aggravated.  That's it.  I don't mean the stinks.  Belle is so aggravated.  Were you in a bedroom or a bathtub?  Bedroom.  And who peed on who first?  It's so funny.  He peed on me first.  Where did he pee on your butt?  You're so bad at storytelling.  In my face.  I can't even imagine you, like, being a phone sex operator. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my God.  And I did it for free.  Okay, wait a minute.  Where on you did he pee?  Her face.  Oh, your face.  Did you swallow it?  Huh?  Did you swallow it?  I don't remember.  Okay, where on him did you pee?  I feel like that's a yes.  On his face, too.  Yeah, that is a yes.  You peed on each other's faces?  That was a long time ago.  Okay, that's not pertinent.  So, you peed on his face.  Did you pee in his mouth?  Nah, I don't remember.  You were kind of drunk?  How do you not remember?  I was kind of drunk, and that probably happened. 
[02:31:30]  All right, well, whoever that guy is, my heart goes out.  I guess...  Yeah, we should get Belle out of here.  This was wonderful.  What a blast.  That was fun.  Go see Belle tonight.  What we mainly accomplished is that she's now irritated with Diana.  I think that was the important part.  And Mandy, thank you, too.  Yeah, and everyone, please read her essays on XOJane.com, because they're awesome.  Yeah, I respect the fact that you're speaking your mind, and you're not letting people fucking  cow you or shame you.  Or bully you.  Good.  And bully.  Yeah.  There's no bullying going on here. 
[02:32:00]  Don't listen to these fucking people trying to tell you what to do in your life.  You're sober and aware, and if you want to do it, you do it.  If you don't, you don't.  There you go.  Thank you.  And Sherry Shepard thinks the world is flat, so that's all you need to know.  Sherry Shepard is a dunce.  Well, I have Diane on my side.  Yes, and you know what?  Can you follow me on Twitter?  I'm on Twitter.  I'm on Twitter.  777.  Oh, my God.  Can you love it? 
[02:32:30]  Everybody knows it anyway.  All right.  Belle, what's your Twitter?  My Twitter is at belle underscore nox.  K-N-O-X.  And also, if you want to check out, if you want to learn more about my demented, sick,  and twisted fantasies, you should check out my Tumblr.  But don't look at it in public.  Wow.  Not safe for work.  Okay, cool.  It's not safe for being around anybody.  Only in the confines of your dark, dark mind.  All right.  Let's take a break, right?  Yes, let's do that.  And thank you to Mandy as well.  Bye.  Thank you so much.  And welcome, Donald Rumsfeld, to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:33:00]  Sir?  Yes, indeed.  How are you?  Very good.  Very good.  What a pleasure to talk to you.  Boy, you have been a part of history in this country for many years, known many presidents.  Welcome to the show, Mr. Rumsfeld. 
[02:33:30]  Well, thank you.  It's a little embarrassing to discover that I've lived one-third of the history of our country.  One-third the history.  And been involved in a lot of things that have gone on through history.  Here's a guy who, you know, met Eisenhower as a congressman, right?  I was running for Congress, exactly.  And, you know, worked for Ford and Nixon and Reagan and both Bushes.  And there's still those people out there that think, you know, Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are actually lizards who, I mean, literally, there's people that think they're lizards from outer space. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Who eat human flesh.  I don't know if anybody's ever asked you directly, sir, but are you a lizard?  I don't think people are.  Actually, can you just please give that a straight answer?  Are you a lizard person?  Louie's a little left-leaning, sir.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Let him answer.  Are you a lizard? 
[02:34:30]  Here's the short answer.  I'm in New York City.  I walk down the street.  People walk up, shake hands, stop me.  They want an autograph.  He's a lizard.  I want to get a photograph with me.  I go to eat last night at dinner, and Joyce and I were sitting there in the little Italian restaurant, and a man came up and said he'd like to buy my dinner.  Yeah.  And it turns out I paid for my dinner.  The next thing I know, the waiter comes back and said, the man insisted to pay for your dinner, and here's your canceled receipt for me.  Oh, wow.  That's very nice.  See, there's plenty of people that he's not going to dignify an answer to, are you a lizard, Louie? 
[02:35:00]  Why not?  Because he's not a lizard.  What is the story about getting somebody paid for your dinner?  I would pay for a lizard's dinner.  I think I understood the fact that there are people out there that appreciate what he's done as a leader.  There is plenty of evidence that this guy is a well-decorated and appreciated American, and he has more credibility than almost anybody.  Exactly.  But I just want to know if he's a lizard.  He's not a lizard.  Stop it. 
[02:35:30]  Mr. Rumsfeld, I want to ask you a little bit about the situation that's going on now in the Middle East.  You are an envoy to the Middle East.  What do you see happening there?  What's your take on the whole situation?  And these are great questions, Anthony, and they're questions that Mr. Rumsfeld is going to answer better than almost anybody in the world.  Yeah.  But I still want to know if he's a lizard.  Stop it.  If he's tasted human flesh.  No, stop.  I just want to know.  Mr. Rumsfeld, again, I want to apologize for Louis C.K.  He's a stand-up comedian. 
[02:36:00]  Look, if he's a lizard who has eaten people.  Don't encourage him.  It'll just make him worse.  See, and I will stop the second I get a denial, I'll stop asking.  Tell Louis that my grandchildren are listening.  See?  Well, listen, they have a right to know, too.  No, he's not a lizard.  And he's not tasted human flesh.  The Opie and Anthony show is back on Sirius XM.  I'd rather be with, I'd rather be with, I'd rather be with an animal. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  We'll be right back. 
[02:37:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:37:30]  The naivete, is that how you say it, of the 18-year-old?  Well, she's old beyond her years.  You know what, though?  She's got some life experiences there.  But there's still so much fucking, like, oh, that's adorable.  Oh, yeah, sure.  You sit and listen to her talk, and you're like, oh, okay. 
[02:38:00]  A lot of those causes you're taking up, I can see those going to the wayside.  About half of them in two, three years.  You won't even give a shit.  And then when life beats you up a little more, yeah, you'll start kind of turning on a few other things.  It's cute.  Again, she's one of those, you know, like white male privileges and stuff.  That's just a term.  But that didn't bother me.  I know it's just a term.  It doesn't.  Yeah, yeah.  It's something that people are so, like, just it's ingrained in their head to say it at that age, especially. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, but she'll get out of it.  She'll get out of it.  And that's exactly what I meant.  It's like, that's the thing that after a couple of years, you'll get rid of her.  I enjoyed the hell out of that.  It was funny and sexy.  She's definitely cute.  Lady Di.  Yes.  So, what's going on with you?  Tell them what you just told me in the hallway.  What you got to check.  Oh, I got to check my underwear for skid marks.  Are you joking? 
[02:39:00]  No, I'm not joking.  Okay, good.  You should check.  I think that's important.  I hate when that happens.  That means you got to wash them and rinse them out.  So, you get skid marks sometimes?  Yeah, I do.  Can we, um.  God, I bet it's a disaster.  I don't know.  Can we check?  This is unorthodox.  But hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  Maybe for a few bucks, because she needs train fare.  Could you go in the bathroom, take your underwear off, put them in a sealed plastic bag and bring them back in?  No, no, no, I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to.  Well, we, hold on, hold on. 
[02:39:30]  Hear us out first.  A sealed plastic bag, like biohazard.  Yeah.  You need some money.  I feel like, we understand you've been sick.  You're a little ill.  No one's going to, I mean, we want to see them.  We understand it's because you're sick.  Well, you know what?  In the morning, I always get.  Yeah, I understand.  It's not a bad idea.  You throw up every morning.  Not, no, well, not every morning, but, you know, sometimes it happens.  It's not normal.  Yeah, you, you.  It happens sometimes.  No, I love how she makes everything, as a matter of fact.  Now, my arm fell off, but it's okay. 
[02:40:00]  I've got another one.  No, no, don't worry about it.  People don't throw up every morning, unless they're sick.  Your very, your alcoholism is terrible.  Your alcoholism is killing you.  We're killing you.  All right.  I got you.  I got you.  No, you don't.  We're a bit worried.  All right.  Yeah.  You want to go on record and say, we're worried about you.  All right.  Thank you.  It's a lot of fun to be around.  You're hilarious, even though you don't know it.  And, you know, you got to take care of yourself.  You got to.  You have to.  I'll be 52 years old.  It's about time I do that.  Sure. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  About time.  All right.  We're getting a plastic bag for your underwear.  No.  I'm not going to walk around with no wonderwear on.  It's a great idea.  It really is a good idea.  No, I don't think it's a good idea.  And then you put the underwear back on.  No, no, no.  Look, Sam's coming with baby wipes and everything for you.  Oh, God.  No.  Come on, man.  One white Charlie's, probably.  Oh, it was one white Charlie's.  Someone Twittered that we did a 90-minute white night thing.  Not at all.  It's almost like, how dumb are you guys?  I'm not doing it. 
[02:41:00]  It's so easy to attack a sex worker and so corny.  It was just a fun time for everybody.  She was nice and she was open.  She was great.  I have something I have to tell you.  I can't pay attention to those people.  What do we mean, peers?  Yeah, what?  I have something I have to tell you.  Okay, what's your name?  Okay, back in the 80s.  Yeah.  A long time ago.  Yeah.  Every weekend, my boyfriend gave it to me in the ass in a car.  And I did not like that, but... 
[02:41:30]  I'm sure he said that too.  What the fuck?  I forgot to mention that.  We weren't talking about...  What the fuck?  I forgot to mention it.  Wait, hold on.  Every weekend...  Every weekend...  He'd fuck you in the ass in your car.  Yeah.  His car?  Yeah, his car.  What kind of car?  I didn't have a car back in the 80s.  What kind of car?  I had a car, but I didn't use it.  I was with him.  Not for fucking in the ass.  Yeah.  Every weekend you had to deal with that?  Just every weekend.  Holy shit.  Every weekend you knew it was coming. 
[02:42:00]  Did you finally tell him to stop?  Oh, boy.  That was back in the 80s.  Did you ever get anything on his penis?  Well, let's put it this way.  I was...  Back in the 80s.  Little 80s new wave music playing on the radio.  Oh, God.  What do you think was playing?  I'm on a Mexican radio.  She's getting real.  I need some aha.  Play a little take on me.  Take on me.  Yeah, Travis, let's hear a little take on me.  Take my ass. 
[02:42:30]  Take my ass.  You know what?  You know what?  I think you like the tightness of it.  Oh, really?  Really?  Do you think guys like tight, warm things around their dick?  Wow.  You're breaking some new ground here.  Right.  Yeah?  You know, yeah.  Oh, here it is.  Take on me.  Where did the car park?  Where were you parked?  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  Uh-huh.  Just one second.  All right.  Come on.  He was...  We were hanging out in a bar back then. 
[02:43:00]  Uh-huh.  The same bar that we still hang out in.  Well, you know.  Is he still around this guy?  Uh, no.  He lives in Pennsylvania right now.  Uh-huh.  Okay, so what happened?  You're getting off track.  You get off track all the time.  Where would you go?  You would go to the bar.  You're not fucking in the bar.  I don't care about the bar.  So you get in his car.  Yeah.  Where do you drive to?  How much was the beers?  He drove to like a park and stuff like that, you know, where there was nobody around.  Wait a minute.  The point it is.  Yeah.  So he'd take you to the park.  Ron Johnson, stereo salesman.  Yeah, he used to take me to parks and stuff. 
[02:43:30]  So you go to the park.  Yeah.  Now you'd park somewhere.  And then he would...  And where would you go?  The back seat?  Yeah.  You'd hit in the back seat.  No, no, no.  The front seat.  The front seat.  Wait, wait.  Front seat?  Yeah, the front seat.  Was it a bench seat on the front or two buckets?  No, it was a bench seat.  Bench seat.  Yeah.  Like an old school car.  Right, right, right.  All right, so then he would turn you over on your stomach?  Is that how it would go?  On the bench seat?  Would he make you suck it first to get it wet?  Yeah, how did he lube?  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  Yeah?  Would he lick your butt?  No, he didn't do that. 
[02:44:00]  No one licked ass back in the 80s.  So wait a minute now.  Was there ever an accident on his penis?  No, no, no, no, no.  Nothing like that.  He never gave his helmet like a little Abe Lincoln hat?  No, no.  An Abe Lincoln hat.  There was never accidents like that.  Would he come in your ass?  He had to, right?  Uh, I don't think so.  Oh, he would come in your ass.  No, no, no, he didn't do that.  Why wouldn't he?  Of course he came in your ass.  No, he would come on my back.  Nah.  Maybe if he was fucking you in your pussy, he would.  But he would fuck you in the ass. 
[02:44:30]  That was back in the 80s.  He had the big hair.  We saw the pictures of the lady died back in the 80s.  Yeah.  You were marginally fuckable back then.  Come on, man.  With a smooth, sweet talk.  I was fuckable back then.  Yeah, you know what?  She did all right.  At a party, a few drinks.  I've seen the young, young pictures.  I saw them too.  Marion never.  Lady Di had.  You look like one of the, you know, you look like.  Marion never what?  I don't know.  She was never fucking.  No?  No offense to Marion.  Now she's going to be mad at me.  Oh.  You were though.  That is not nice.  You were back in the day. 
[02:45:00]  That is not nice.  Why would you say that?  Lady Di looks like one of those background girls in every John Hughes movie.  Right.  She looked like one of those girls.  Not the lead.  She's in the background.  Yeah.  In the crowd shots.  Right.  We got the big hair.  Yeah.  We got that, I don't know, fucking blossom look.  Was it a Budweiser jacket?  Yeah, it was a Bud Light jacket.  Enough with Budweiser.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Wait a minute.  You were wearing a Bud Light jacket and getting fucked in the ass in a car in the park?  In Jersey somewhere. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, but it all started on a door in an abandoned building, of course.  No, no, no, but it wasn't the same guy.  All right, well.  Wow.  It wasn't the same person.  So there's the door.  Yeah, the door.  Now it's an abandoned building.  There she is.  Yeah, that one.  All right.  See, pull that up.  Let's see.  She was all right.  Let's see.  Let me see.  She did all right like that.  Oh, boy.  That's you right there.  She's got Tina Fey mouth.  Yeah, that was over 20 years ago.  Oh, fuck you in the ass.  You're wearing a Bailey's fucking shirt and a Bud jacket.  Yeah, you did all right.  Full of booze. 
[02:46:00]  Not bad.  You knew there was a party going on there.  Are you heavy there or no?  No, I wasn't heavy.  Go to the belly.  Let's see where the pant line is.  Yeah, but it was the 80s.  Well, hold on.  You used to do cocaine?  Pants were higher.  Yeah, well, back then I used to do cocaine also.  Oh, you did a little coke.  Yeah.  Aren't you still alive?  You never knew that?  No.  Everyone did in the 80s.  Oh, my goodness.  Come on, how much coke were you doing?  I don't know.  Did he blow a straw full of coke up your asshole before he did numb it?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  To numb it.  To numb her ass. 
[02:46:30]  So you would do a lot of coke?  What would you do?  You would have sex for cocaine?  Well, let's put it this way.  The cocaine numbs you.  Cocaine?  The cocaine numbs your body, so it was easy to...  Uh-huh.  For him to go.  It was easy to take it over there.  So wait, he would get you guys to do coke and he'd numb you up a little bit, then he'd  put it in your shitter.  Yeah, if you want to put it that way.  That was so long ago, my God.  So long ago, you know what, Val?  Yeah, that was a long time ago.  It still happened.  You could say it was long ago, all you want. 
[02:47:00]  It still happened.  I used to be.  Are we doing the panty thing, Sam?  No.  Oh, yeah, we got it.  I'm not going to do that.  We'll pay you for it.  But I guess we got to fire you because, you know...  Interns don't deny us.  Interns have to do what we're saying.  We're willing to compensate for the panty.  We'll buy you a bunch of new panties.  The problem is when you say no, it sounds like insubordination.  And we'll add money...  You know, I sound like you're not dedicated to the job.  We'll add money to your salary.  What the hell?  I'm not going to do that.  Jimmy's good for it.  I'm not doing that.  Absolutely.  There's certain things I'm going to do. 
[02:47:30]  Some things I'm not doing.  Here, clubs.  No.  No, no.  How much do you want for him?  Let's just talk turkey here.  We just want your panties in the plastic bag and bring them back.  How much do you want for him, my love?  No.  But you say...  Name the number.  No, no, no.  Lady Di, we're kind of having a shitty show today.  We need something to pump it up.  Come on.  Soak it in the ass, Lady Di.  Who cares?  I got a rod right now.  Had sex on a door in an abandoned building.  Why is this bad?  I'm not going to do that.  Oh, we're the creeps.  God knows what else you've done.  Right.  We're not pulling up to your house with Duran Duran cranking waiting to put it in your ass. 
[02:48:00]  Fucking A.  Come on.  The re-flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, ba-doon, doon, doon.  And there you are, just fucking getting long-stroked up your rectum.  Hey, lady, guys, what if we make a deal?  What if we trade your panties for a train fare?  Oh.  Oh, no.  You can't do that to me, please.  Panties for train fare.  That's a deal.  Yeah.  I think we got a deal.  Get the shirts made, Sam.  Get the plastic.  No.  Get the plastic bag. 
[02:48:30]  Train fare.  I'm not going to do that.  Yeah, yeah.  Train fare.  Train, train, train.  Here's the plastic bag, lady.  No, no, no.  I said no.  Just go down to the bathroom.  Put the panties in.  We're going to just come back.  We're going to examine them for a minute.  Two minutes, and then you can put them back on.  No, I don't want to do that.  Why?  And then you'll have train fare.  Train fare.  I'll tell you what.  Let me go to the bathroom now, see if I have anything, and then I'll let you know.  Bring the bag just in case you get braved.  I don't feel like doing that.  We want to see the panties.  How much would it cost?  Let's talk money here.  Let's just talk about it.  We're not making you do it. 
[02:49:00]  We're talking.  Hey, Di, what about this?  What about this?  Train fare and a beverage from TGI Friday.  Hey, that's nice.  Come on, Di.  A couple of rounds.  A couple of rounds.  A couple of rounds of TGI Friday.  A couple of rounds.  You want to get guys to rub themselves on you.  That's right.  How much?  Here's how much?  Here's 20 on the table for your panties.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  Hold on.  I can't just stand by and watch this.  This is so creepy. 
[02:49:30]  Here's $20 on the table for your panties.  What?  What?  Look.  What are you?  Oh, my God.  What is it?  Did you want mine?  Did you want mine in?  That's $100, Bill.  Well, then I guess I can take mine.  I'm just, you know why?  Because I don't want to kibitz over this any longer.  I'm just going to do it right there.  I'm not going to kibitz over this all day.  This isn't a debate, Jerry.  I'm not going to debate you.  $140 for your panties. 
[02:50:00]  That's the easiest.  $140 for your panties in a bag.  But now, we're not going to kibitz like he said.  Yes.  It's already almost 10 o'clock.  Exactly.  Run in there.  Take them off.  Drop it in your bag.  You've got 20 seconds.  Bring them out.  You get $140.  You get $140.  $140.  What's my underwear for?  What's your salary?  15 seconds.  Yours is not to reason why.  15 seconds to decide.  You are a stupid lady done.  No, I'm not going to do that.  $140 on the table.  I'm not going to do that.  You get the cash right now.  Cash on the barrel head.  There it is. 
[02:50:30]  Yep.  What would it take?  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow.  No, no, no.  No, you got the runs today.  What will it take to get those underwear in that bag?  What will it take?  Tell us why.  Name a price.  Name something.  We got the price.  $140.  I want to see why it isn't enough.  I'm not saying why.  Give our money back.  Why not die?  Oh, don't watch that money.  Lady Di, look at all that cash.  Yeah, I see it.  You know, Bill ain't going to fucking give you that without an interrogation.  I know.  Bill's here nickel and dime and you.  Bill would be happy.  We're asking you just for something silly to have a fun moment on this show. 
[02:51:00]  We're not nickel and dime.  We're paying you to be here.  I will give you $140 for your underwear.  Who the fuck sells underwear for $140?  No one.  A fucking porn star would do that.  Maybe.  Maybe.  We didn't ask Bell Knox for her underwear.  I would pay fucking, yeah.  Right.  She would do it for $140.  Of course she would.  Anybody.  Any woman would.  I don't know any woman that wouldn't sell her underpants for $140.  Jesus H. Christ, Chief.  So just go.  We're running out of show.  It'll be funny.  You can keep them if you want. 
[02:51:30]  I value my panties a lot more than $140, Chief.  What do you say?  Di, it's a great idea.  Oh, I'll be right back.  All right.  All right.  There it is.  You come back.  I have to find out if I...  Don't.  Don't worry about it.  Don't even do anything.  Don't worry about it.  Just put them in the bag and bring them back.  Right.  Let's go.  That's all we need from you.  Let's go.  Day two of Lady Di's internship.  Well, she doesn't care.  Yeah, she's going to be...  We're having some fun. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, no, she won't.  Let's go.  Don't worry about marrying all the time.  By the way, we got the best of Lady Di's internship day two.  Oh, my God.  Audio we haven't even played yet.  Dude, she's a gem.  She's just unbelievable.  She's a gem.  We got Lady Di screening the calls.  We taped that.  Ooh.  Aha.  So here's that as we wait for Lady Di's panties.  ONA, what's your name?  Brian.  Brian.  Okay. 
[02:52:30]  How you doing, Brian?  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, guys.  I just want to say happy birthday.  Congratulations on the child.  R-I-A-N.  Okay.  I'm going to buy you a toy trigger.  Is that inappropriate?  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Okay.  Lady Di.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  All right.  Listen.  I'm a nurse.  Diarrhea is a sign of pre-term labor.  You better get to the hospital.  I don't have to get to the hospital.  You want to...  Fire and I just wanted to sign the labor.  You better get to the hospital.  Okay.  You want...  They're not on the air right now. 
[02:53:00]  ONA, what's your name?  This is Simon.  Yes.  Hi, Simon.  Yes.  Have you heard the run yet, Lady Di?  This morning I did.  No, but I mean right now.  No.  Not yet.  But those patches are just putrid.  Oh.  Okay.  ONA, what's your name?  Hi, it's Joe.  Can I suck your toes?  Could you...  Could you do what?  Can I suck your toes?  Suck my toes?  Yeah.  Okay.  ONA, what's your name?  Matt.  Hi.  How you doing? 
[02:53:30]  Matt.  Hey, Lady Di?  Yes.  Are you going to abandon this child like your last one?  Dirty Diarrhea monster?  These people.  ONA, what's your name?  Biff.  Back to the future.  Biff.  Oh, Biff.  What do you want, butthead?  Okay.  Okay.  You want to talk to ONA?  I want to talk to them.  Yeah.  I'm glad to get hooked up with you.  I want a piece.  Who wants to fuck you?  A date with me. 
[02:54:00]  Just stupid.  A date with me.  With me.  And then as she's screening calls, Marion called in.  ONA, what's your name?  Hi, it's Marion.  Who's this?  Who do you think it is?  It's me, Diana.  Hey, how are you?  All right.  How's everything?  I'm okay.  Listen, Diana, you made it to work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I heard a little bit of the show right before I came in the building.  Right.  Yeah.  And, um, Diana, what did you say about Bill? 
[02:54:30]  What did I?  No, I didn't say anything.  They said something about Bill.  Okay?  Oh, Marion.  He likes to stay home all day, Marion.  I mean, that's not healthy for him.  I know I do a lot of bad things.  I know what he's going to do, but listen, you know, you made it there.  I'm glad you made it there.  Oh, God.  I got the runs today.  I told him that's all.  Because I wanted to make sure you got there.  Yeah, yeah.  And I heard a little bit of the show, but I am, like I said, I am in a building and I 
[02:55:00]  do have to get to work.  Yeah.  I got the runs today, though.  I, you know, I mean, I might have to run to the bathroom pretty soon.  You know what?  Maybe you should stay away from TGI Friday.  But listen, with TGI Friday, you got sick, too.  I remember that.  I mean, I don't know what happened.  I had the runs yesterday.  I had the runs.  Did you eat?  Did you eat?  Did you eat?  No, they're going to get me something to eat.  I'm going to try to eat.  They got me a coffee colada, so this way I can get the runs again.  Oh, God. 
[02:55:30]  I swear to you, I would pay good money to just sit back and listen to those two talk  for an hour.  Yeah, have their little conversation.  She was shitting yesterday.  They have to do an hour show on this channel immediately, not regularly, but get them on  just to do an hour with no direction.  Just let them go.  Just let them go.  Turn the mics on.  God, Marion's a bit of an enabler, huh?  Always worrying about Lady Di.  But she's, you know why?  I think having Lady Di around makes Marion feel superior and better than everyone else 
[02:56:00]  because she's like, she sees how bad it could be because she's always talking down to Lady  Di.  And then we tape Lady Di going to the bathroom because she's had the runs all morning.  I'll be all right.  Oh, God.  Are you drooling a little bit?  Yeah.  You think you're going to go?  I don't know yet.  One, one until you get there, right? 
[02:56:30]  Oh, God.  Oh.  Is that cough always like that?  Yeah.  What's that from?  I'm going to puke.  I'll be all right.  That's bad, though.  We worry about you.  You need to be sick?  No.  You sure?  Ah!  Want some water?  Wait.  Okay. 
[02:57:00]  And Don Corleone and the tomatoes.  You good?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's fucking going to die.  Let's just say it.  Let's just fucking say it already.  Someone's got to help this woman.  You're saying this?  Yes!  You don't care about anyone.  I know.  I don't care about her.  But I mean...  Just don't do it on...  No, not on our time.  On our time.  That's nothing we could fucking put up with. 
[02:57:30]  Please don't.  Holy shit.  Don't make her do anything.  No.  Strenuous.  Please.  In the old days of ONA, we would have had her doing, like...  Jumping jacks for money.  Jumping jacks.  Jumping jacks.  Running.  Sprinting up and down the hallway.  All that.  I don't feel very good.  No, Lady Di.  Run more.  Run.  Remember the time we tried to get that girl to give birth on our show live?  Yes.  Doing jumping jacks.  She was over nine months.  She came in and she got completely naked. 
[02:58:00]  We made a run up and down the stairs.  We did everything we could to induce labor.  Try to have her give birth on our show.  We should bring that one back.  That one could be fun.  So then Lady Di went into the bathroom and came out.  I threw up the coffee colada.  You threw up the coffee colada?  Why?  I don't know.  My stomach says I don't want it.  How about the rice?  You gotta eat food.  I will.  I'm gonna try, okay?  How about the rice?  I threw up in the sink.  You threw up in our sink?  Yeah.  I don't like throwing up in the bathroom. 
[02:58:30]  What about in the toilet?  I don't like throwing up in the toilet.  Is it clean?  You're not throwing up in the sink?  Yeah.  I know everything is clean, but I don't like it.  What about the runs?  No.  No, no.  Not yet.  Okay.  I thought I was gonna have them.  Did you clean the sink?  No.  The sink is stopped up.  It's stopped up.  How did it get stopped up?  I don't know.  Was it maybe the vomit?  No, I don't know.  I don't think so.  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't think vomit would do that.  Oh, God, man. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, my stomach.  Oh.  Yeah, you gotta get some.  I will.  I'm out.  When I go back.  What are you looking at?  She's dying.  Peter Tork.  Peter Tork.  All right.  You found a photo of Peter Tork.  Yeah, but, but the whole thing is, I really wish you guys could get him.  I really wish you would have something to eat and not throw up.  All right.  All right.  I'm just puking in the sink.  I'm just throwing up in the sink, Dennis. 
[02:59:30]  She has the runs.  She's puked in the sink.  She's puked in the sink.  What abominious day two.  Her fucking organs are just breaking down.  They're shutting down.  She's incapable of holding a job.  No.  Oh, sorry for such, sorry for giving you guys such trouble.  Such grief, you know.  Could you imagine?  Sit down, have your breakfast, talk to Dennis.  He's a good talker.  Yeah.  Oh, God, you don't feel good?  She's not taking care of herself.  Morning.  Morning sickness?  No, it's not morning sickness. 
[03:00:00]  Morning sickness.  Even Denny gets in.  He's getting a jab in.  A little bit.  The one thing I want to mention with the Marion phone call, where Marion's like, oh, so you  made it to work today?  Yeah.  To work.  Like, in Marion's mind, this is a real job.  This is a job.  Right.  She couldn't hold a job.  Jimmy's right.  Could you imagine being her employer and that showing up, coughing, puking, shitting  all over the place?  Well, we did wonder for years why she doesn't work.  Why she isn't working.  I think we're figuring it out ourselves now.  And that's just two hours into the day. 
[03:00:30]  Right.  Yes, two hours into the day.  Could you imagine her an eight-hour workday?  No.  It would be impossible.  I think she's got, like, stomach cancer or something.  Well, the bloated stomach is not good.  Because she doesn't eat.  No, she doesn't eat.  But she's got a giant, distended belly.  I think that's liver disease or something.  I think she's got cirrhosis of the liver.  She's a mess, man.  Maybe some kind of fucking stomach problems.  Her lungs.  She's hacking shit up to the point where she's puking. 
[03:01:00]  She doesn't eat, but she's fat and she's got diarrhea.  Holy shit.  And every weekend in the 80s, she took it in the ass.  She took it in the ass in the 80s.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Sam's coming back.  Sam.  Let me tell you.  You got him?  Yeah.  All right, Lady Di.  I have one question.  Yes.  Is the money well spent?  Yeah.  Lady Di just picked up.  Lady Di just picked up.  Quickly scooped up her $140. 
[03:01:30]  I haven't looked at that.  Wipe your nose here.  Wipe your nose here.  You got boogies coming out.  But I had Lady Di just give me a description.  Huh?  I had Lady Di give me a description.  I haven't looked at them.  Okay.  Can I tell you what she told me?  Yeah.  Thank you.  She said they're a little wet.  And I said, why are they wet?  She said, because I peed on my cellar.  It happens.  You know, what are you going to do?  That happens.  And then everything just happens with Lady Di.  She has had, she, literally, literally, let me say this.  But she's not.  Liquid has come out of every hole in her body today. 
[03:02:00]  But she's not wrong.  Things do happen.  It happens to all of us.  It's not all in the course of two hours.  You try to squeeze out a fart and all of a sudden a little nugget pops out.  You know.  Wow.  I wasn't finished.  But thank you very much for the money anyway.  I wasn't finished.  Sorry, I wasn't finished.  Okay.  Because after she said, I peed on myself, I was laughing.  And then there was a dramatic pause.  And then she said, and also they're a little brown.  Well, that's because I had an accident before.  We understand what great happens.  Lady Di, we are grading on a curve.  We understand that there's some issues today. 
[03:02:30]  Should we videotape the opening of the underpants?  Well, the bit is this.  Oh, E-Rock.  He's got to put the bag on his face and give a good sniff.  Underwear's a size 10.  Oh, is that good?  Yeah, that's okay.  They're also monster paintings.  They're good.  They're using wheel covers on fucking track the trailers.  Tell E-Rock to get the, we have the gloves, right?  Surgical gloves?  Yes, right there.  All I have to do is open up the bag, put it completely around his face and give one 
[03:03:00]  good sniff.  Well, give a good sniff.  But then we're going to want an examination.  Oh, yeah.  Then we've got to throw it on the...  Give the camera self.  We do want an examination also.  E-Rock's giving us the fingers.  E-Rock!  Get him in here.  Get him in here.  Oh, he's waving us off.  He's waving us off.  No, he's not.  He just tapped out.  E-Rock.  Get him in here.  Of all the things we've had you do...  You don't have to close the curtains for underwear?  No.  He's coming down the hall.  He's not.  It's just for nudity.  It's just underwear.  That's all it is.  Oh, okay.  Because he doesn't want to see it.  Come on, E-Rock.  Get in here, baby. 
[03:03:30]  Wait, I think he...  Whatever.  I think he's...  I thought he was coming down the hall, but he went the other way.  I think E-Rock is saying, no way, Jose.  He's making himself unavailable.  He certainly is.  All right.  Here he comes.  Hey, I took a look at my hair, and I said, oh, no, I've got to do something with this.  What's wrong with it?  Oh, it's just, like, stringy and stuff.  It gets like that.  I'll give you 100 if we could shave it today.  Oh, no, no, no.  Are you pulling it out?  I'm not going to do that.  Are you pulling it out?  You've got some...  Yeah, sometimes I do that.  There's a balding going on up there. 
[03:04:00]  Sometimes I do pull it a little bit, yeah.  Why are you pulling it out?  That's nerves.  Eric, that's nerves.  Really?  It is.  Hold on.  Eric, of all the things we've asked you to do over the years...  I've never done shit stuff.  Well, you don't have to.  It's called your work.  Every bit of work.  You're not doing shit stuff.  All you're doing is taking a sniff into the bag.  We'll examine.  I don't care.  We'll drop those panties on the table and examine ourselves.  Do we have pokey sticks?  Poking sticks? 
[03:04:30]  Well, what do you think?  I have some kind of disease or something?  Wow.  No, but you know what?  It doesn't matter.  All bodily fluids must be handled in a professional family.  I understand that, but...  All I want is Eric to just put the bag around his face and give a sniff.  That's all.  Why couldn't this have been with Bell's panties and stuff?  I know.  And then we could have fucking...  We always go down the right road and then all of a sudden we take the wrong turn.  The wrong turn?  I'd have done it without the gloves, with my mouth.  Just been sucking on them. 
[03:05:00]  Filtering T.  Yes.  God.  What do you think, Eric?  Hold on, hold on.  What do you think?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Go between Jimmy and Lady Di.  All right.  I just want you to sniff.  Right there.  Stay there.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Put your...  Put the cushion on.  Jimmy...  Wow.  Jimmy is really gun-shy here.  Yeah.  There's stains on these.  What?  There's stains on these.  Oh, no.  So that's Lady Di's panties in that bag.  We just want you to sniff.  Just put it around your head and sniff. 
[03:05:30]  Put it around your nose like a feed bag.  It's probably not that bad.  It ain't that bad.  Believe me.  Trust me.  It ain't that bad.  Give it a...  Trust me.  Smell it.  Oh, no, no.  You're like...  He dropped it.  You're like...  He's gagging.  Wait.  Pick up...  No, no, no.  He's gagging.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Please don't...  No, no, no.  Don't puke in the bag.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not...  No, no, no, no.  We're not puking.  Those are ours.  We bought them.  We bought them.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  They're bought and paid for.  Iraq is salivating a bit.  No, no.  No, no.  Don't let her get them. 
[03:06:00]  They're ours.  We bought them.  We bought them.  We bought them.  We bought them.  We bought them.  We paid for.  You sold them for.  No.  I have to walk around with no underwear.  That's sexy.  Sit down for a bit.  We'll give them back at some point.  Sit down.  We'll give them back.  E-Rock, what does it smell like?  There's a time release on that.  Yeah.  You smell it.  It's not that bad.  And then all of a sudden, it just kind of takes over.  Yeah.  Was it baby diaper-ish?  It's must.  It's cigarettes.  Oh.  Cigarettes in my...  What?  That's impossible.  Everything you own smells like cigarettes.  I don't believe that.  Any ass?  I don't believe that either.  Sam, or whatever sickness she has. 
[03:06:30]  I don't have a sickness.  She's fine.  You throw up every day.  Well, that's because, you know...  We're Sam.  We're Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  We're getting our money's worth.  I used to...  Or Anthony's money's worth, mostly.  I remember years ago.  That's all of ours.  Why not?  No, I remember years ago when I worked at Bud.  Pretty sure.  Every once in a while, you know, when I went there.  I would have to hit the bathroom every once in a while.  You're not supposed to throw up every day.  And I was skinny back then.  All right.  Oh, lady.  Sam, it's your turn.  Put the camera.  We're Sal. 
[03:07:00]  I don't know.  Why the fuck did Sal just walk out?  You know, I...  I could only imagine...  People are not going to be happy about this.  What do you mean?  This underwear thing.  Hold on.  Oh, Marion?  I don't know yet.  I'm just saying.  Let me just...  Let me just see something in it.  Let me just see.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Di.  Sam's going to check.  Stop interrupting.  Now you're being rude.  All right.  Sammy's going to check.  We're doing an important bit here.  Give it a little...  You want to check my bra, too?  No.  No.  Hey, Sam.  That was...  Your bra's old hat.  Sammy's giving it a shot here. 
[03:07:30]  Come on, bro.  Come on.  He dropped it.  No, that's not a...  And...  Sal, your turn.  They're not bad.  Sal, give it a good snip.  Put your own face in.  Let me smell that.  Let me smell that.  Let me smell that.  No, it's not hard.  Hold these.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jim.  Hold on.  Now, we have to look at them.  We have to look at them. 
[03:08:00]  Here.  Oh, my God.  What does it smell like, guys?  Oh, there.  It's just filled the whole bag up.  So, when you put the whole bag on your face, like, it just overtakes you.  Wafts.  Wafts.  They're just joking.  Hold it.  Hold it.  She's going to take it back.  E-Rock's right about there being like...  Don't give it to her.  E-Rock's right about there being like a musky smell about it.  Yeah, yeah.  But there's also...  I mean, you could see...  There's piss.  Well, of course, I just peed myself.  That's one of the main problems.  Everything's just so as a matter-of-factly said. 
[03:08:30]  That's what happens when you gag sometimes.  Sometimes you just...  All right, let's dump them on the counter.  Put some paper down or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gotta get a little paper down.  It also has that hint of, if you cleaned up after a party...  I am going to get so many hints today about this.  I already know what's going to happen.  She's just talking.  She just stinks.  Made the newspaper or something.  Yeah.  A paper towel.  Put a newspaper down.  Just enough for the newspaper to cover up the console.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  So they can immediately be taken care of.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Now, don your gloves. 
[03:09:00]  Wait, get the camera out.  Yeah, yeah.  And now, who's got the gloves?  Someone's got to put gloves on because you're going to have to move it and look and turn it inside out.  You know, we're going to do a full examination here.  Well, I asked for pokey sticks.  And let you know what happened.  Sam's got a little knife.  Okay.  All right.  I had a little accident.  So what happened?  A little accident.  It happened to everybody.  A little accident.  When you cough to the point where you puke, you're going to piss yourself.  Let me tell you something right now.  Go right ahead.  Let me tell you something right now.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Tell us. 
[03:09:30]  I used to buy the diapers, the adult diapers, because I was getting a lot of, you know, leakage down there.  And then I just decided to go back to the regular underwear, huh?  You're too young for that.  Why?  Yeah.  Why did you go back to the regular underwear?  Because the adult diapers are too expensive.  So she's got...  You know, $23.  Just like if you bought baby diapers.  Do you understand you never disappoint? 
[03:10:00]  Oh, thank you.  Oh, thank you.  No, we're being...  He's being serious.  Lady dies.  Lady dies.  Don't touch her colada.  Of course, I don't want the colada.  You need to take better care of yourself.  And you need to be checked out by a doctor.  I always get checked out by a doctor.  Who?  The Vini Boom Bats.  The Vini Boom Bats.  I go to the clinic.  And when was the last time you went...  My next appointment is April.  And what is it for?  April.  For check-up?  Yeah, for a check-up.  And then there's one in May for the GYN. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  I do it every year.  I do it every year.  So many fucking falcon gloves.  Well, that's what girls do that.  And someone's saying you've got an anxiety disorder.  That's why you're pulling your hair out.  And another guy's saying, my mom died of what lady die has.  What did he have?  What did she have?  Cirrhosis, right?  You lose that guy.  Cirrhosis of the liver?  Are you okay that you might die early?  I don't know when I'm going to pass away.  I don't think anybody knows when they're going to pass away.  True.  I can walk down the street.  But you're not taking care of yourself, though. 
[03:11:00]  You're racing to the finish line, though.  Yeah.  You're not taking care of yourself.  You're increasing your odds drastically.  Uh-huh.  You're right about that, but...  Well, let's get to the undies.  Pull them out of the bag.  Sam's got the gloves on.  We're now going to take them out and give them a little exam.  Here they come.  Wow, those are big.  Oh, no.  Oh, lady die.  What happened?  I told you what happened.  I told you what happened.  Can I put them back on?  No, you cannot.  No, you wait.  Can you put them in the middle of the console? 
[03:11:30]  I can't see.  Now, we need somebody to manipulate these a little bit.  Is that the front?  That's the front.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Those are the front.  Uh-huh.  So, now we're going to have to open them up, and let's look at ground zero, as I like to call it.  Yeah, let's take a look.  Sam, you've got gloves on.  Oh.  Lift them up like normal underwear.  Wait, what's going on with the back?  All right, that's the front, and...  Oh, there's some skids in there.  I'm going to erase them this way. 
[03:12:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, well, I told you I had an accident today.  Yeah, we're, like I said, we're grading on a curve.  It's okay.  Yeah.  I told a swamp ass story yesterday.  Uh-huh.  You got to get a good...  Oh, my God.  Open the...  You got to turn them inside out, Sam, so we can get to go back.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you guys.  I think I'm smelling up.  You know what?  You got to, like...  Turn them inside out, Sam.  Yeah, thank you.  For Christ's sake, it's just underwear.  Get in there.  Get in there.  You got the gloves on.  Come on.  I know I'm not the only hard cock in this room.  Let's go.  All right.  They're inside out now. 
[03:12:30]  I'm trying to make me...  Come on, Sam.  You're acting like they're gross.  All right.  Now show the backs.  No, no.  Put it on the console.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  What happened there, Lady Di?  I told you what happened.  What happened there?  Accident.  Did you itch?  Did you dig in and scratch?  No.  No?  Oh, my God.  Why are you coming to your mouth?  Because it's...  Well, there's a fragrance coming off of those. 
[03:13:00]  Little bit.  Just a little bit.  All right.  It's a little pissy.  Yeah.  And a little assy.  And shitty.  Yeah.  And shitty.  All right.  Can I put them back on now?  No.  Why would you want to?  Yeah, man.  Because I might have to run to the bathroom again?  There's shit and piss on them.  Why do you have to run to the bathroom?  Uh-oh.  Do you have...  Are you bubbling again?  Almost.  You got a little salad shooter action?  I don't know.  You all right? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Did you have your sandwich?  That cough is bad.  Did you eat?  Yeah.  I had a few bites.  Oh, good.  A few bites.  A few bites.  You'll be here.  What did you have?  Oh, God.  What?  Nothing.  What's the matter?  What?  You all right?  Yeah.  Can I put them back on?  What's the matter?  I have to go to the bathroom.  Leave them.  Go to the bathroom.  You don't need them on to go to the bathroom.  What's the matter with you?  Just go to the bathroom.  Give her underwear back.  Jesus.  We got what we use.  Oh, God.  We should give her new underwear, though.  Why do you want those big...  Well, she's got 140 bucks to buy... 
[03:14:00]  Breathe in a minute.  Sam, one more sip.  Giant underwear.  Take one more sip.  Come on.  Just put them back to the bathroom.  Oh, Jesus.  Take one more sip.  Are they really that bad?  Okay.  They're really bad.  I've never wanted to push somebody's face in the underwear.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Go ahead.  Trudger juice.  Lady Diag, there's tears pouring off your face.  What's wrong with you?  You're gagging.  You're gagging?  She's going through withdrawals.  She needs alcohol.  All right.  Are we allowed to give her alcohol?  No.  I wouldn't.  All right.  I'm just asking. 
[03:14:30]  I don't want any more of that culotta.  Oh, is the culottas doing it?  I don't want any more.  Look how much is left.  There's a half an inch at the bottom left.  I don't want any more of that.  It's like a gallon, too.  It's one of the giant biggest fucking drinks I've ever seen.  There's one sip left.  Let's say hi to Mark in Jersey.  Mark.  That's her underwear.  This show is the best I've ever heard.  But on a serious note, I know you guys are concerned about her.  And you said her stomach is distended?  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  Big time.  Well, I came back from college one year.  You know, God bless my mother's soul.  But she had a drinking problem.  And she looked like she was seven months pregnant.  And within a month after that, she went in the hospital, never came out and died.  That's your liver shutting down, Diane.  God bless you.  She can't hear you.  She's in the...  But she doesn't...  I don't think she cares.  No, no.  It's not my liver.  She'll do that.  She'll do that.  It happens.  Everyone has a big distended belly and a liver.  Right.  Everyone.  Yeah, and then her kidney shut down after that.  It's your body telling you that you're dying. 
[03:15:30]  She is a disaster.  She just won't stop.  Yeah.  The coughing, the puking, pissing herself, shitting.  We go to Binghamton.  She's a mess.  Dan in Binghamton.  I missed my drives through Binghamton on my way to Rochester.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I'm sorry you had to, man.  You know, besides all her physical defects, she clearly has at least, like, early stage  Korsakoff syndrome, which is basically alcohol-induced dementia.  So she's not just killing herself. 
[03:16:00]  She's making herself crazy.  It's called Korsakoff?  Yeah, it's Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome, or just Korsakoff for short.  It's not that short, obviously, but K-O-R-S-A-K-O-S-F, I think.  Korsakoff.  And what, that happens to alcoholics?  They get that kind of cough you heard?  Yeah, and in fact, you can tell she's doing a bunch of compensatory things, like the way  she repeats what you say, that's a problem.  No, the name Korsakoff isn't the cough.  That's the name of the dementia that she's getting.  Oh, gotcha.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:16:30]  It's written as Korsakoff cough syndrome, but it's Korsakoff syndrome.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Okay.  And, yeah, so in a couple of years, I mean, she's not going to remember, like, there's  videos online of people with very extreme versions of this, where they'll be interviewing,  and they'll, you know, one question in, forget where they are and shit, so I'll see you in  a year, Diane.  Yeah, she's in the bathroom, because she's got the runs.  Oh, all right, all right.  Well, I'm going to punch out, then.  All right, buddy.  Oh, Sam, what's the prognosis? 
[03:17:00]  You fucker?  You fucker.  You fucker.  She kept, like, stopping in the middle of the hallway to start gagging.  Could you imagine her having a job?  What is she doing?  She was like, stop, and put her hands over her mouth to just start going, oh, oh.  Why is she so sick?  Because she's going through withdrawals, I betcha.  I think it's withdrawals.  Because she didn't have any beers today.  She needs to get a beer.  I had to physically, like, push her towards, yeah, said, you've got to do this in the  bathroom, there's garbage cans. 
[03:17:30]  I bet if she had, like, two beers, she'd be a different fucking person right here.  You would see, like, hey, whoa, she wouldn't be coughing.  I bet you're right.  Yeah.  So maybe in the morning she should go out and grab a beer, like, before she comes in  tomorrow or something, just so she doesn't go to withdrawals.  She's going through some withdrawals right now.  It's crazy.  She needs a rehab.  She went right to TGI Fridays yesterday and probably felt great after that.  She goes, ah, it happens.  It happens.  It happens.  That doesn't happen.  You ever have your underwear look like that? 
[03:18:00]  Not, uh, all the time.  I think everyone, at some point, has had some bad undies, but not like that.  I've had my underwear look like that, but the colors were reversed.  I know what you're implying.  There was shit on your dick.  And pee in my hiney.  And pee in your hiney.  Somebody tinkled in my hiney.  Tee hee.  Ah, gee.  And she's making a real major impression with the workers around here now because it's 
[03:18:30]  been two days and two full mornings.  She's a familiar face.  Everybody's asking a lot of questions and really getting annoyed with her.  Are we going to get to Friday with this?  I don't know.  We'll get married.  Uh-oh, what's the matter?  Like, I just got a text from the people running the Entertainment Weekly morning show  saying, who is that lady following you?  Is that a new intern?  Oh, no.  Uh, who?  Yeah, I know.  It's not us.  Oh.  Well, maybe.  Who is it, though?  Valerie Bertinelli? 
[03:19:00]  You've got a picture with Valerie Bertinelli?  You've got a picture with Valerie Bertinelli?  Why?  This show is so stupid.  He cannot not take a picture with somebody.  It's Valerie Bertinelli.  Who cares about Valerie Bertinelli?  Wasn't she on her way out, but she made a huge comeback, right?  She's on that show with Betty White.  Yeah, and she's on the Weight Watchers commercial.  The Weight Watchers thing.  Wait, wait.  Oh, is that Eddie's old squeeze?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I was thinking of somebody else.  Valerie Harper? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  Yeah, Valerie Bertinelli?  It's like, who cares?  Oh, that's funny.  If we interviewed her and she was in the studio, I wouldn't get up to take a picture.  Oh, that's great.  Jimmy can't not take a picture.  All right.  Oh, shit.  Wow, she's in bad fucking shape.  And we got Kelsey in San Diego.  Kelsey.  Good morning, guys.  Hello.  Hey, I just wanted to point out to you guys, when you noticed that she had that bald patch 
[03:20:00]  and she started talking about pulling, sounds like she might have a condition called trichotillomania,  which is an anxiety disorder where people will kind of sit there and pull out their hair.  It's a pretty common anxiety behavior is pulling, tugging on your hair, twirling your hair.  Right.  But to pull it out to the point of bald spots and stuff is pretty severe.  Yeah, it is.  So, I mean, that's just another kind of presenting concern she's coming in with.  And I would definitely encourage her to maybe come in with a hair beforehand. 
[03:20:30]  And her hair is just thin and wispy also.  She's going to go through withdrawal.  And greasy.  Thin, wispy, and greasy.  I don't even think she showered.  Like, yeah, she doesn't take care of herself.  We've tried.  I don't know what to, you know.  I know.  What do you do at this point?  We've talked to Marion.  We tell her right to her face.  It's not even one of these things where it's like, well, you tell her.  This went from fun to downright depression.  This is fucking day two.  We're already talking interventions.  Stop calling with everything she has.  Right?  Okay?  You pricks are just having a little fun here. 
[03:21:00]  Right, man.  Just trying to get to Friday.  You know, the size of the search area is bigger than the United States.  It is, right?  For this dumb plane.  How do you find that?  In the water.  Yeah.  That includes water.  But you've got to think of so many people are searching, obviously.  Because they'd be heroes if they found it.  Yeah, true.  How was Valerie?  Nice, but I really didn't even want to do that.  I just did it because he asked me to.  I didn't mind doing it, but E-Rock suggested it.  It was nice of him. 
[03:21:30]  So why don't you just say, no, no thanks.  Because I'm like, yeah, why wouldn't I?  Yeah.  Who cares?  How does she look?  She used to be pretty cute.  Oh.  Back in the day.  She's probably in her 50s now, right?  She's probably...  God, she's been around forever.  She's like an old lady now, right?  No, she looks...  Considering she's...  Older woman?  Yeah, I think she's...  Yeah.  53.  Huh?  53.  Dian's a fucking mess, man.  That's what we're talking about.  And these guys are calling with everything she has.  It's all depressing now. 
[03:22:00]  It's depressing everybody.  But we have tried over the years.  What do you do?  Over the years, we've tried.  Marion has tried.  And she has the attitude, ah, it happens.  We slapped Stalker Patty back together.  Really?  Pretty good.  Yeah, we were able to, you know...  Oh, nice.  You know, give her some opportunities and some help.  And she was able to capitalize on it and run with it.  And now she's a responsible member of society.  Should have wrote that off to charity when I was doing my taxes.  Right.  But Lady Di is one of these that just... 
[03:22:30]  She won't fucking listen to reason.  Yeah.  And she's a little too old for that shit.  She's fucking coughing until she pukes.  She won't even try.  No.  She'll be here tomorrow, though.  She rationalizes everything.  She just, like, blows it off, like, no, it's okay.  No, that's fine.  Oh, it happens.  Every hole in her body is leaking something.  Her eyes, her nose.  Her eyes, her nose.  She's coughing up stuff.  She has the runs today.  The ears aren't just because there's nothing happening between them. 
[03:23:00]  Yes.  Oh, God.  That's so poor.  Jimmy, you got some plugs?  We might as well start wrapping up.  Yeah, let's wrap.  Virginia Beach this Thursday, Friday, Saturday, March 20th through 22nd.  Tampa, April 11th and 12th.  And then here in New York, Caroline's April 24th through 27th.  Nice.  On tomorrow's podcast day, I think we might do a quick edit and put that Bell Knox hour  up there because it was sexy and hilarious. 
[03:23:30]  A little thought-provoking at times.  Thought-provoking.  I think we'll do that for tomorrow's podcast.  That'll be a good one.  That'll do well.  Certainly.  She had way more fun on our show than she's had on anybody else's.  Oh, in any of the interviews I've seen.  Oh, God.  Of course.  Not as much fun as some of that giant cock she took and some of the other things I watched  her in, but.  Yeah.  So, all right.  I was hoping to get one last update from Lady Di before we leave for today. 
[03:24:00]  Well, Sam, can we get one?  Can we house phone run down there and just check before we do it?  Yeah.  Sounds like she's still in the bathroom.  All right.  We'll leave.  Okay.  Sam will probably get audio if anything's happening.  He'll do the after show.  He'll have an update, I'm sure.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  Leave it.  Leave it for him.  Why not?  Yeah.  Why not?  All right, everybody.  All right, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Thank you.  The Opie and Anthony show has gone to a close. 
[03:24:30]  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts, Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments. </pre>
