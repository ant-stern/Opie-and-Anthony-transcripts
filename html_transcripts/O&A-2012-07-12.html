<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between personal anecdotes, celebrity gossip, and current events.  The show began with Opie and Jim Norton discussing Opie's frustrations with Time Warner Cable, his preference for Fios and Slingbox, and a humorous auction for a large, unwanted wedding painting he received as a gift. This segued into Opie's experience with a professional organizer, the rediscovery of the painting during the cleanup, and a broader discussion on receiving unwanted gifts, particularly artwork.  They shared childhood anecdotes, including Opie's minibike accident and a discussion about the stark contrast between their own unsupervised childhoods filled with tree fort building, fire starting, and various injuries (including poison ivy and nails in their feet), and the anxieties surrounding children's safety today. This led to a caller recounting discovering a dead body as a child, which transitioned into discussion of Robert Blake's appearance on Piers Morgan.  A fictional audiobook, "50 Shades of Gay," was comedically advertised. The segment concluded with more caller stories of childhood mishaps and a guest appearance by Rich Voss, who recounted a gruesome anecdote about a friend's radial arm saw accident and subsequent microsurgery.

Further segments explored a childhood woodshop accident and subsequent crack-cocaine use in Harlem, a detailed account of a frustrating parking ticket experience for Bonnie, criticisms of reality TV shows like Pawn Stars and Storage Wars, anecdotes about past dealings with drug dealers, and celebrity gossip surrounding Stevie Nicks and Richard Simmons.  The hosts also discussed parenting challenges, their children's behavior, and their own past mistakes.  Robert Blake's appearance on Piers Morgan remained a recurring topic, with speculation about his wife's death and analysis of his demeanor during the interview.  Discussion of comedians, including Tom Cotter and Ralphie May, was interspersed with vulgar jokes, embarrassing anecdotes about Opie's experiences while intoxicated on cocaine, and a humorous recounting of a suggestive segment from Rich Voss and Bonnie's podcast. Clips from Robert Blake's interview and the Voss podcast were played.  The weight of aerobics instructors, a listener's arm injury (allegedly caused by Opie and Anthony), and a past incident involving Rich Voss, his birthday cake, and Bobby Kelly (resulting in Voss injuring his arm), further contributed to the show's chaotic but consistently entertaining flow.  

A later segment featured Rich Voss as a guest.  He discussed his Grammy-nominated comedy CD, "Still Empty Inside," his podcast, "My Wife Hates Me," and appearances on Red Eye.  A substantial portion of the segment focused on the Affordable Care Act, Voss's gambling experiences, and anecdotes about his personal life, including losing his apartment. Laszlo from Rockstar Games called in, discussing a rooftop party and an upcoming recording session with Voss, which led to further discussions about Rockstar Games and the video game industry. The segment concluded with more discussion of Voss's comedy career and jokes about the show's end.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently digressed into tangential conversations, maintaining a fast-paced and unpredictable style characteristic of their show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Thank you.  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this event, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do it.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Let's remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah!  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  Yeah, good morning.  To you and yours.  Or just you.  To yours.  Whatever the combo is.  You and you.  Oh, man. 
[00:02:00]  I gotta tell you.  I love that damn sling box.  What happened?  Well, I was in the city.  Yeah.  You know?  Stay in the apartment.  And, uh...  Time Warner Cable could just go fuck itself.  No, I like Time Warner Cable.  Oh, it's terrible.  I like when they, uh...  It's terrible.  I like when I go to my programs that I DVR'd.  Yeah.  And just because I want to, um...  Watch one of my programs that I DVR'd.  Yeah.  I gotta...  I gotta restart the entire cable box.  Every... 
[00:02:30]  Reboot.  ...single time I gotta reboot.  Reboot.  Just to watch a DVR show.  Makes no sense.  It's time for Fios, my friend.  That, yeah, yeah.  I'm going Fios.  I got Fios at my house.  Yeah.  And then I sling box the friggin' Fios to the apartment.  So I don't even need their goddamn stupid Time Warner Cable.  Do you have Time Warner Cable in the city?  Yeah.  I got, like, the basic shit.  So get rid of it, right.  But, uh...  I do need it for, you know, the internet.  So I can have the sling box stuff.  Mm.  But, uh...  God, it's just so much fucking better. 
[00:03:00]  Makes it a lot easier.  Oh, it's just...  It's a whiz.  It's a boon to mankind.  No, I like getting up off the couch and rebooting the cable box so I can watch a DVR show.  Every fucking second.  So what is that?  I don't even know what that is.  Is that a bad cable box?  No.  It's just the way it is.  I had my cable box replaced.  I think it's...  This new cable box is maybe three months old.  On the surface, it sounds like a hardware thing.  It sounds like it, right?  I think it's their service.  It just stinks.  It's always been terrible. 
[00:03:30]  And the box that I have at Time Warner, I didn't even get it replaced.  That's why I got the sling box.  For some reason, it just stopped delivering sound to my television.  And I was so pissed.  Like, I just got the sling box.  Now it just sits there.  Why are these cable boxes so sensitive?  Oh, I don't even know.  I feel like I would replace a couple a year easy.  I've had Fios for two years and I haven't had to replace anything.  Oh, fuck.  It's great.  My can never...  You know what I never have to do anymore?  I used to have...  It was like weekly and then it was bi-weekly and then it was daily. 
[00:04:00]  I'd have to reboot my cable modem.  Like, oh.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's another one.  I've had Fios for two years.  I think I've done it maybe two or three times.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  Yeah, well, some people...  Some people don't want to get it.  Oh, my God.  You want a painting?  What?  You want a painting?  Uh-oh.  Do you have a room?  Oh, no.  Do you have a room that I can hang a painting?  What?  I'm stuck with this wedding painting still. 
[00:04:30]  Wait, which one is that?  When I got married, there was a guy in Philly who...  Oh, right.  Yes.  ...who just assumed way too much.  Oh, my in-laws are listening.  Fuck.  That's pretty presumptuous.  Turn off the radio.  No, they're cool with this.  And I'm just joking.  They're very cool.  No, some guy, he's a nice guy.  He's down there in Philly.  His brother's a really good artist.  No.  Assumed that we would like this painting for our wedding gift. 
[00:05:00]  And I could speak for myself.  It's not my taste.  See?  That's presumptuous.  Why would you do something like that?  And then I sound like an asshole, but whatever.  But I...  You don't have to say anything.  But it's not my taste.  And when you buy art for someone, you've got to really know a lot about them.  A lot about the person.  A lot about, yeah, what their taste is.  Why would you get somebody artwork like that? 
[00:05:30]  And I know this is like old news, but it came up again yesterday because we got someone helping us reorganize the entire apartment.  Because with the second kid coming, I've got to organize some shit.  Oh, you've got to start switching some shit around?  So we're going through everything, and we're moving everything and throwing shit away.  And then all of a sudden, the lady's there going...  It's almost like a hoarding thing, actually.  Really?  Not really.  Oh, do you want this?  Now, what if I took this away?  I kind of felt like that.  Maybe it's like a low-level hoarding thing. 
[00:06:00]  What if we took this away from you for, let's say, five minutes?  How would you feel?  Oh, I would love it.  Good.  Get rid of it.  But I think when you hire these companies, there's low-level like us.  We have to reorganize everything for a second kid.  And then, of course, it's the cat shit in the bags blocking the staircase up to your bedroom.  Well, they are what?  Professional organizers, right?  Professional organizers.  Yeah, they used the same exact people for hoarding.  You're right.  We kind of felt like we needed one. 
[00:06:30]  So we got one.  She's great.  Going through it.  And I threw away so much stuff.  It's not even funny, man.  And there's the painting again, which I had hidden.  I was good with the painting because I didn't see it.  Toss it.  Just toss it.  You think?  Just fuck it.  How much could it be?  Get it over with.  How much could it cost?  No one will know.  Well, now they'll know because I'm talking about it on the radio.  The guy's still alive?  Yeah.  That painted it?  He's actually a very good local artist.  In Philadelphia.  Yeah?  What's it a painting of?  Well, that's the problem. 
[00:07:00]  It's kind of like a stream in the woods.  I like the woods.  And I kind of like streams.  Is it done well?  It's done very well, but it's a winter scene.  I'm not a fan of winter art.  A little snowy in the woods?  Very snowy.  A little babbling brook going through it?  A babbling brook with a lot of snow.  Huh.  Is it like a la Bob Ross?  Happy little trees?  I get it.  Yeah, because the paint is off the canvas.  Yeah, it's a little textured. 
[00:07:30]  Like it hurts sometimes.  It's like stucco?  Yeah, it's like stucco.  Oh, God.  Sometimes I get scraped by the wedding painting.  Painted it with a fucking spatula and an exacto knife?  Pretty much.  How do you paint that without a brush, motherfucker?  But I haven't thought about this painting.  I've been married, what are we up to?  Almost four years.  Yeah.  I haven't thought of the painting in about two and a half easily.  Because it's been just buried.  But now the organizer, you know, uncovered it.  And now it's sitting in my foyer again.  Oh, man.  And she's like, you don't want this, do you? 
[00:08:00]  She was hinting.  Oh, wow.  I'm like, no, of course not.  That's why it's been hiding.  The organizer must love when you throw shit away.  That's probably like a point for them.  Yeah.  That's like good shit.  Oh, look, they're throwing shit away.  Yeah.  So it's easier to organize less stuff.  Yeah.  So the more you throw away, the better.  Right.  I'm still not used to Manhattan, though.  And I've been here 10 years from Long Island.  Yeah.  She shows up, the organizer, in a designer dress.  Mm-hmm.  And then she takes her really nice shoes off to get down to work. 
[00:08:30]  Down and dirty?  Yeah.  It's like, wouldn't you show up in, like, sweats and something in your hair?  Overalls, yeah.  She was completely made up, like she's going to a cocktail party.  I'm like, this is who we hired?  How much is she actually digging in and getting her hands dirty with?  Um, a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah, just going through every single cabinet, every single closet.  Anything embarrassing ever come up?  No, not really, to be honest with you.  No?  I just wonder, you know, if that happens with her.  No, not really.  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure she's used to it. 
[00:09:00]  Big fucking, big double-tongue dildo or something?  She might find a thing or two, but nothing that's going to make me embarrassed.  Oh, don't worry.  Oh, you should, you can't imagine the things I've seen.  Right.  All right.  So I need to give this painting to someone like...  E-Rock, what about the Nagel Mansion?  You might be able to...  E-Rock, you want me to bring the painting over to the Nagel Mansion?  Estate Nagel.  If I'm still invited, I don't even know if I am.  Oh, please don't.  I don't know what I'm going to do with an oil painting.  It's really nice. 
[00:09:30]  Eat it.  Eat that shit.  Are you painted into it?  No.  What the fuck?  Because then he'd take it.  E-Rock, then he'd take it.  That's funny.  Very good.  No, it's a guy that was invited to the wedding.  It's his brother, who's the artist.  So obviously, he went to his brother.  This guy probably broke and said, hey, I need a wedding gift.  And then his brother probably went, here, here, take this one.  Yeah, he didn't custom paint it for you. 
[00:10:00]  Of course not.  I just did something he had laying around.  But now, like, I don't...  Oh, man, you just got to throw that shit out.  I don't understand why people do this to you.  And I mean...  Yeah.  ...all of us.  Because I'm sure people have stories.  Where all of a sudden someone gives something to you, and now you're the owner of something you don't want.  You don't want it.  So what's protocol?  It really is odd to give somebody something that personal, that's going to be in their house.  Something they're going to have to look at every day.  Right.  That dictates the decorative motif. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  How much wall space does your brother have in his garage?  Yeah, right next to the E-Rock gift.  Because then I feel like I need to show this thing, you know, if this person happens to come to New York or something.  But he's never been to New York.  I barely know the guy.  Toss that motherfucker thing right out.  That sounds like hoarding.  Because he's never been to New York, but yet you've held on to the painting for four years.  I do the same thing.  I'll have, like, a phone charger that I'm never going to...  No, something from, like, a phone from ten years ago. 
[00:11:00]  What if I need it?  Danny, you're sort of right, but I swear to you, I'm a minimalist.  I throw shit away every day.  But for some reason, with this damn painting, I feel guilty or something.  It's huge!  How big is it?  Come on.  It's not like an eight by ten little thing.  It's as wide as the door.  Whoa!  Yeah, it says, wide as the door easily.  Landscape?  Your standard door.  And, yeah, it's a landscape type of thing.  All right.  And then it's probably...  It's almost all the way... 
[00:11:30]  You see the Rich Voss picture?  Dude.  It's at the bottom of that.  Dude.  That's, like, 24-36.  That's a giant fucking painting.  So, 24-36?  Yeah.  You know that world.  That seems roughly it.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Look.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Phone's ringing.  Stunt parade.  I'll give you 50 bucks for the new kids' college fund for the painting.  So what are you looking to do?  Pawn it or sell it?  Yeah, right?  Maybe I...  All right.  So far, I got a $50 offer.  Let's, uh, let's, uh, start the bidding. 
[00:12:00]  Let's go to auction.  Uh, wow.  You know what?  If it's one of these little things that, like, hang in bathrooms or something...  You could almost say, you know what?  That's one thing.  You could throw it up somewhere.  You could tuck it somewhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Something that big.  What a motherfucker putting you in that position.  But the other thing is, when you live in Manhattan, most of your walls are, uh, windows.  Right, yeah.  So I don't have a lot of wall space, as E-Rock has learned the whole way.  Get one of those sticky hooks and put it on the window.  So, I'm bad with that big...  I should just...  Block your beautiful view with a dumb painting. 
[00:12:30]  I should just throw it out the window.  So now I'm...  Now it's...  Now it's an issue again, after two and a half years.  Wow.  Where was it?  A closet?  Yeah.  Just kind of tucked away behind my golf clubs and all sorts of shit.  Toolboxes and...  Oh, then you virtually threw it away anyway.  Cleaning supplies.  Yes, I had it hidden.  You had it virtually thrown away.  That's what I thought.  Now just literally thrown away.  Now it's all...  Now it's in the foyer.  It was just sitting there.  It's an eyesore.  If you put it outside, someone will grab it. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Put it somewhere.  Just lean it against the wall somewhere and someone will go, oh, I'll take that.  Why can't I just throw it away?  Get a happy home.  I don't even know the person.  Yeah.  He's a nice guy.  I see every once in a while at a party and we kind of say, hey, what's up?  Fast forward a few years.  Yeah.  The guy, unfortunately...  I don't know who this is, but let's just say he unfortunately meets his demise.  His maker?  And then you're sitting there going, can you fucking believe this guy's paintings are  not worth fortunes and I threw it away?  I threw it away.  It is nice.  Some guy years ago probably got a Picasso and went like, this fucking thing sucks. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Goddamn chick's eyeballs are on her ass.  Right.  Oh, what the fuck this is.  Yeah.  And he threw it away.  Right.  And then look what happened.  I know.  Maybe that's why.  Yeah.  Maybe that's why.  So...  Triangles.  I guess, you know, and people aren't going to believe me because I've said it a million  times, but now that I've brought it up again, I will certainly take a picture of it today.  You got it now.  And finally tweet it.  Now it's famous.  And finally tweet it because now it's back in my life. 
[00:14:00]  This thing's back in my life.  It's like an accident that won't go away.  Oh, yeah.  I'll throw those away.  It's not as bad, but geez, this thing doesn't talk.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Take a picture of it.  Yeah.  I'll take a picture of it.  I'd love to see it.  It is.  It's nice.  And it's good.  It does it.  Because usually when you know someone that even knows someone that knows the artist,  it's never really that good.  It's kind of a little cheesy.  It's definitely all right.  It's a tight... 
[00:14:30]  Danny's trying to find something similar.  It's a tight shot of a, like, kind of a brook or a stream.  Like that chick on Boogie Nights that painted Dirk Diggler's picture.  Right, right.  Exactly.  It's horrible.  Exactly.  Dirk Diggler's picture was...  That sucked.  Less stream.  Will you make Macy's picture over the fireplace?  Less stream.  Oh.  We need more...  That looks nice.  We need more trees.  Lots of trees.  Snow in the trees.  Happy little tree.  They're right about there.  You almost barely could see the stream because there's a lot of snow. 
[00:15:00]  Lots of snow.  Lots of snow.  Now dip into your lizard crimson.  No sky.  No sky.  Tight shot on trees.  Now just a little bit.  Just some...  Some...  A little hair and some air right about there.  Yeah, they're all...  Get that brush stroke.  They all look the same, basically.  Now bring your reflections straight down and across with a dry brush.  That's nice.  Look at that.  Too much sunlight.  I think it's still snowing, this painting.  We're looking at a lot of paintings.  I don't know.  It's your world. 
[00:15:30]  You make what you want.  I used to hate when he put that giant tree in the foreground.  Right.  Like the thing would look really good.  And you're like, that's cool.  And then he'd dip in and go, what are you doing?  You're ruining it.  And it would be thick.  And it wouldn't even be like a brush.  He would take a fucking palette knife.  And he would just scrape, just scrape oil paint into the canvas.  I remember watching that with my grandmother.  No!  And we're like, I'm seven and we're freaking out.  Like, what are you doing?  You ruined it.  Please don't do that.  Dummy.  But you don't see the amazement in the fact that he can make a tree out of a palette knife? 
[00:16:00]  It really is stupid.  You try that.  A spackle knife and a fucking roller.  Right.  He's painting fucking nice, delicate shit.  With like a four-inch brush I'd use to like touch up a bike frame.  That's what you paint your molding with.  He's making a tree with detail.  He's like, let me dip my afro into this.  It's kind of impressive.  I've got to be honest with you.  And he'd dip it in the thinner and fucking smack the shit out of it on the side of the easel.  And then he'd look and go, ah, that's a lot of fun.  But he, ah, it was never good enough for him. 
[00:16:30]  Nah, no.  You always had to add something.  You always had to ruin it.  He always had to add something.  Why don't we put a little cabin right here?  No cabin.  Leave it alone.  Dummy.  God.  This pink thing again.  Yeah.  I had it figured out.  Buried.  You're at the point where the organizing, you've got to go through your closets and start throwing  shit out?  Like you want it that fucking organized, huh?  Well, it's been four years.  Is that the limit?  No, I mean, it's been four years since, you know, things have been kind of piling up. 
[00:17:00]  It's not a hoarding situation.  It's just time to reorganize.  I got a second kid on the way and I got a, you know, an apartment in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Every inch of space matters now.  And then all of a sudden, you know, I threw away an old set of golf clubs.  I threw away two sets of rollerblades.  I threw away a brand.  Uh-oh.  Shit.  Uh-oh.  What?  I threw away a brand new shredder that someone might have bought for me around here.  Oh, no.  Oops.  Did you?  And it's still in the box. 
[00:17:30]  Why?  Just threw it away.  Do you have another shredder?  Just threw it away.  Do you have another shredder?  I use oil now.  I just oil up all my documents.  What do you mean oil them up?  Oil.  I use oil.  I really do.  And dirty diapers.  Oh, you just smear it all over your fucking documents?  Yeah, because I didn't feel like opening up the shredder.  I love a shredder.  I love shredding.  It's just fun.  It's like a game, too. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, because you've got to keep the papers going in and keep the shredder going.  Because once there's a little sensor in there that lets the shredder know that paper is going through it.  And then once it gets done, it automatically shuts off.  Right.  So your trick is to keep the papers in and keep the shredder going without shutting off.  It's a fun game.  I'm not responsible enough for a shredder, I've learned.  Really?  Why?  You might shred something.  I've broken three of them.  What are you trying to shred?  Because I can't.  Bleeding. 
[00:18:30]  What the fuck am I doing?  Jesus.  I just picked.  You picker?  I picked.  You're a picker.  That's a sign of mental illness.  Are you picking everything?  No, I swear.  What happened there?  Jesus Christ.  No, you start with like 10 pieces of paper.  You're like, oh, if it shreds 10, it certainly will shred 15.  Oh, see, that's your game.  And I can't help myself, and I jam shredders all the time and break them.  That's your game.  You want to see how much shit you could get in there.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Love that.  What is this?  He's doing exactly what we're talking about. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, a big tree.  You don't need that tree.  A big brown line.  Why is he so dang?  He wrecked it right there.  Why is he doing that?  I'm annoyed now.  Because it leaves a heavy layer of paint on it.  And of course that tree needs a lot of branches.  Let's give him an arm here.  How the fuck do you do that, though?  Come on.  You decide how many arms your old tree has.  You decide.  And how many foots he has.  There's an old foot hanging over there.  My buddy got his foot blown off and now.  Yeah.  So I'm going to give this happy tree two feet that my buddy never had. 
[00:19:30]  I'm brave here.  You try to draw a tree branch like that.  It'll never come out like that.  As easily as he does it, dude.  Look, he's not even trying.  Is his paintings worth anything?  Chance.  I wonder.  How many have to be out there?  Like, it can't be a rare thing.  Well, the problem is he painted way too many, I think, too.  You want to pawn it or sell it?  Yeah.  Well, Bob Ross, he put out a lot of paintings.  It's going to sit in my shop.  I've got to get it framed.  Yeah.  I'll give you $30.  There's a lady, speaking of painting, I didn't get a good picture. 
[00:20:00]  She knows all the glitters is gold?  Yes.  I didn't get a good picture of her worth Instagramming, but she's always around Sheep Meadow, if you know Central Park, and she does giant paintings.  What do you mean?  Look at this.  She paints giants?  Look at this.  The canvas has to be at least 10 to 12 feet across.  What the fuck is she doing with those?  It's actually this whole wall, I would say.  Yeah, a mural.  It's like 10 feet by, I don't know.  What do you think? 
[00:20:30]  Wow.  10 feet by maybe 16 feet?  Yeah.  And she paints while standing with a brush that's three to four feet long.  Oh, so she's like, how do you get detail like that?  And she just kind of, she barely bends over with the brush, and she studies, and then it  takes her about five minutes in between brush strokes, and then she'll finally do something.  She's been there for years.  Stupid.  There's so many weirdos in New York.  Yeah.  What's she going to do with it? 
[00:21:00]  She lays it down on the grass, and she's making this giant painting.  I don't know.  Goddamn, Bob Ross painting's going for like fucking...  How much?  Five grand, 5,700 bucks?  Really?  This one's 5,700.  Damn!  Is that the average price, or...  I don't know.  It's the only one I saw so far.  Is it the ones that are like...  They have to be the TV ones.  The ones he's done on TV have to be the big money items right there.  I thought I'd come across more on the old eBay.  I hate the ones where he taped off the edges of the canvas, and then he rips the tape off,  and it makes it like in an oval. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, right.  I can't stand that shit.  You don't like that?  No.  So now the painting.  I guess I got to just throw it...  You think I should just throw it away?  Just fucking toss that thing.  It's...  I would love to give it back to the guy and go, it was really nice, and I appreciate  it, but maybe I could give it to somebody else.  See, I am a caring guy when it matters.  I think you should toss that thing.  Like the radio version of me would just fucking kick it in its cunt.  He'd just rip it.  Fucking take a knife to it.  I would, though.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  So maybe that's what I do.  I bring it in here.  Then there'll be no guilt associated with...  Then it's the radio thing, right.  ...with the destruction of the painting.  Yes.  All right.  Bob Ross painting.  Huh?  $450 Seascape.  Wow, this is...  Practice painting.  This is old.  That was a couple years ago.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That looks like shit.  So that was my day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...  A lot of organizing.  You should have...  Thrown some shit away.  You should have thrown it out.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Toss that thing.  Yeah.  What do you do? 
[00:22:30]  You have a...  You have an extra room?  Or are the kids going to be in, like, one room?  They're going to start in the same room, I guess.  Yeah.  And then I'm going to fucking move.  Usually the way...  Are you going to...  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  You're going to move?  God, asshole.  Well, the radio career's not doing that well, so I don't...  I don't think...  I don't think I'm going to be able to expand.  Blow out the floor under you and...  I mean, I'm lucky.  I got four bedrooms.  That's pretty huge in New York.  Yeah.  But to get to that next level, we need to go back to Eddie W in the afternoon drive. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  I'll probably end up in a house eventually.  But yeah, we'll start that way.  Because I don't want to give up my guest room.  We have a real nice guest room.  Oh.  A lot of guests stay?  Yeah.  For the people that come and go.  Family and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, the right thing would be to give each kid their own room.  But then where do the guests sleep?  See, this is bullshit.  You don't worry about that shit.  No.  No.  You have plenty of room, right? 
[00:23:30]  Plenty of room.  I love it.  I've been staying in the apartment, though, the past couple of days.  Yeah.  Walls closing in?  It is kind of cool.  I like...  But here's the biggest issue.  I never realized...  But I did realize, and now I see the result of it.  I have, like, a maid service and stuff that comes to my house...  Right.  ...and takes care of it.  Right.  I don't have that at the apartment.  Oh, boy.  So you're living like a college kid. 
[00:24:00]  It's a fucking disaster.  There are clothes strewn everywhere.  And it's only been a couple of days.  Yeah.  I got shit in the sink.  I got to, like, wash and fucking...  And I know this is stuff normal human beings do.  Get a lady.  I got a lady.  Get a lady.  The bed just never made and...  You don't make your bed, do you?  Towels.  That's kind of cool.  Is it?  I think so. 
[00:24:30]  Is it really?  You don't like that shit?  No.  Not at all.  How about just every once in a while?  I don't mean on a regular basis.  I think that's kind of cool every once in a while.  I think maybe every once in a while, but...  You might meet a young lady in the laundry room.  Hi.  Well, what kind of softener do you use?  Well, look at this.  It's just me and you down here.  What have we got here?  Let me help you with that.  She'd look at me doing the washing and go,  excuse me if I could help because you're doing it all.  Oh, I don't know what I'm doing here. 
[00:25:00]  I'm not used to it.  You need some extra softener?  I'm newly single and I...  Well...  I just moved into the city  and I don't know anybody.  Do you like guns?  Just petrify the poor woman.  Well, what do we got here?  Yeah, you got to get a cleaning lady.  Yeah, it's every...  So come here once a week,  keep it all nice for you?  Yeah, the living room, the kitchen,  and the bedroom, and the bathroom  are all disasters.  Those damn Mexicans are cheap too, man.  I love a good Mexican coming out of my house  and cleaning up.  And they'll scrub. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, they will.  Yeah, they're not going to come in  with a fancy dress.  I got like a team.  I got a team of three Mexicans  that clean my house.  They go right through.  They come in,  they go through it like a tornado.  It's great.  But the apartment,  not so much.  I left today  and just locked the door  and walked away.  I'm like...  Is anything growing in there?  No, it's not.  I don't have a dirty thing going on,  but I have a very cluttery,  like messy thing with clothes  and just things like that, 
[00:26:00]  but not food.  You would probably be a hoarder  if you didn't have people  cleaning up your stuff.  But it's lazy hoarding.  It's not hoarding  because I don't want  to throw anything away.  Right.  It's like,  why don't I pick up  my fucking pants  that I just took off?  Clothes all over the floor  and all that?  Yeah, yeah.  And I've always been like that.  Did you ever make your bed?  Never.  Me too.  Unless I was forced.  I was forced as a kid.  Make that bed.  So I think I kind of,  you know...  What a hacky parenting thing  to do to kids.  It's just dumb.  You got to make a bed.  Why?  Because that's what parents  tell their kids to do  and I'm just... 
[00:26:30]  Honestly, it's the stupidest thing.  It is stupid.  As long as your sheets  are still on your mattress,  who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  If the sheets pop off,  then I understand.  I'll give the sheet blanket  comforter thing  a good whoof  every once in a while  over toward the pillows.  Right, right.  And if it lands fine,  that's good.  If the other side  is kind of folded under,  I ain't going over there  to straighten it out.  My kid is lucky  because I'm not going  to be that guy.  You're not going  to be that guy?  No!  I don't give a fuck  what your bed looks like.  Who cares?  It's some kind  of discipline thing 
[00:27:00]  that parents do, I think.  For what reason?  I think just because  it's been done  all those years.  Hold on.  Yes, congratulations  on winning  a national championship.  You'll remember it  the rest of your life.  Congratulations.  I was telling Anthony  about that this morning  so I wanted to show it.  Tim Tebow.  I wanted to show you.  Congratulations.  Set on out.  Okay, cool.  Thanks.  He...  Oh, shit.  Look at that.  He...  He's playing  for my Jets.  That's all I'm going 
[00:27:30]  to say.  Wow.  He's got a...  He's got one  of those voices, man.  He does.  That's all I'm saying.  He does have  one of those voices,  doesn't he?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He walked out  with Jessica Biel  last night  to start the ESPYs?  Yeah.  And, uh...  Wow.  Wow.  She's a lot more, um...  manly.  She had a deeper voice.  Yeah, yeah.  I believe she officially  had a deeper voice  than Tim Tebow.  More masculine voice.  That's all I'm saying.  Of course.  He's got a lispy thing 
[00:28:00]  going on,  and he's a college graduate.  He has a very effeminate  sounding voice.  And he's a monster.  For a big football player.  Yeah, he walked  on that stage.  He's a huge quarterback.  Yeah.  Or so it seems.  I don't know.  He had a huge fitted suit on,  and then that voice  comes out.  It doesn't match up.  Yes.  That's all I'm saying, man.  Yeah, well, you know.  It doesn't...  In the end,  it doesn't matter, obviously, but...  Of course not.  Well, now we've got people  going, what do you mean,  obviously?  It still matters  where I'm from. 
[00:28:30]  You think that whole religion thing  is a way to kind of keep  from having to address that?  I think a lot of people do that.  They use religion.  It's like, meh.  I don't really like  where my whole thing  is going here.  Let me embrace religion.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's a really good question.  Yeah.  He seems so innocent  that maybe he just doesn't know.  Maybe he doesn't know  that he's...  Is that possible, you think? 
[00:29:00]  You gotta know, though, right?  You'd think you would.  You gotta know.  Maybe it's just his voice.  Who knows?  Maybe it's just his voice.  You know, he could be  the manliest guy ever.  We don't know.  Well, he sort of is.  If you play football,  you're pretty manly.  Pretty manly.  I wasn't brave enough  to play football ever.  And I loved sports  when I was growing up,  but that was one I was like,  nah, I'm good.  Fuck that.  People could beat the fuck up.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  So, oh, back to your apartment.  So is there food laying around? 
[00:29:30]  No, no.  I don't like that.  Because there's rats, dude.  No, no, no, no, no.  No food.  I know because a New York City apartment,  you definitely don't want  to leave food around,  so there's no food laying around.  Because they will find that shit.  There is some stuff in the fridge  that's a little suspect.  I gotta get rid of some of the stuff  from the fridge.  Yeah, but it's in the fridge.  Put it this way,  some of the stuff the X left.  So it's been there a while.  Oh, really?  What kind of stuff?  A couple weeks.  I don't know,  like fucking,  like, what's in there?  Like a fruit thing.  And it's all like shriveled now.  Now it's dried fruit. 
[00:30:00]  It's like there was a thing  of grapes in there  that all of a sudden  are halfway between grapes  and raisins.  You should take a picture  of that shit.  That's funny.  Yeah, I probably should.  That shit's funny, man.  It's a wreck,  but there's a couple  of Coronas in there.  We saw a rat  at the playground  two days ago.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  The rats and the raccoons  are very brave this year.  I don't know why.  Some fucking,  didn't some family  get attacked  by a bunch of raccoons recently?  Where?  I don't know. 
[00:30:30]  I kind of glazed  over the story.  But like a fucking raccoon,  a family of raccoons  scratched up this woman,  bit her and shit.  Fuck.  Just going crazy.  Does that mean rabies?  It could.  Daytime,  but it's a whole family.  Maybe they all have rabies.  Yeah.  It's,  yeah,  that's one of those things  of a taxi in the daytime  or something.  Yeah,  woman covered with bites,  scratches,  and bizarre mauling  by raccoons.  Where the fuck was this?  Where is that?  Washington?  Lakewood Washington. 
[00:31:00]  Washington.  A jogger.  State or Washington?  Washington.  It looks like state.  Suffered numerous scratches  and wounds  after she was attacked  by a family of raccoons  in Lakewood.  Wow.  That may have been started  by,  oh,  her dog.  Oh,  see?  Dog versus raccoon.  Raccoon every time?  Every time,  right?  Yeah,  raccoon's fucking vicious.  Yeah.  I had that raccoon  in my house,  got caught in the cage,  and I taunted him  because I'm real brave  when they're in a cage. 
[00:31:30]  Of course.  And I was taunting him,  and he was like,  rah,  like barking.  Fucking barking.  That's scary.  Yeah,  those things are vicious.  Yeah,  I told the story,  one just moseyed up  and started drinking water  at the playground.  Oh,  man.  And it was my...  Were people like  grabbing their kids?  Well,  it was my kid  that was going,  he goes,  it's a coon.  He calls them a coons.  He goes,  a coon,  a coon.  And I turn around  assuming...  What playground were you at?  I turn around  assuming that, 
[00:32:00]  you know,  he's too young  to know the difference  between an a coon  and a dog.  Yeah,  yeah.  So I'm like,  oh,  yeah,  it's a dog.  And I turn around  and I'm thinking  it's a dog.  I'm assuming it's a dog  and I'm ready  to pet the thing.  Yeah.  It was two feet away  from me  and it moseyed  to this,  one of the playgrounds  has this man-made  stream that the kids play in.  And it just moseyed  to the stream  and started drinking water  in front of everyone.  Drinking water?  And then,  yeah,  you're right.  Everyone just immediately  grabs their kids  and starts running.  Like it's a monster.  Well,  it kind of is.  It can't fuck you up,  yeah.  It was during the day, 
[00:32:30]  you don't know.  You don't want your kid  having to get those rabies shots.  Then it had its fill of water  and then it just moseyed  through the bars of the fence  and back into the woods.  Now,  how does your kid know  how to say a coon?  Do you like,  did you,  do you point at things  and go,  raccoon?  Well,  we were at another playground  earlier in the season  and there were,  there were two,  I filmed it  and it's not worth seeing  but I did film it.  It was a raccoon  coming out of the trees  and going into  all the garbage pails.  So I was telling him,  he picks up shit.  Yeah,  that's pretty funny.  Little kids pick up shit.  Amazing.  Quickly. 
[00:33:00]  Them little fucking  kiddie brains,  they just fucking  soak that shit up.  I mean,  you know,  people have always said  that kids are like a sponge,  they pick up everything.  Yeah.  It's true.  I don't think my kid's  any different  than any other two-year-old.  I'm not going to be  one of those parents.  I hope he's a little smarter  or whatever  but I think he's just  developing normally  but if he's,  if he's picking up  everything like a sponge,  like,  what do I do?  Do I teach him  a foreign language?  I'm panicking.  You got to fit a bunch  of shit in right now.  Yeah,  because I think it's only, 
[00:33:30]  I think it's only a window  of a few years.  Yeah,  yeah,  there's this weird.  And then all that shit  slows down,  I think.  Yeah,  because they could learn,  they learn English  just by hanging out.  He knows a lot of words now.  And they're kids,  they're like,  like kids are smart  in kid ways  but when you really  think about it,  you know,  they're kids  so they're not very  knowledgeable about things.  Yet they could learn  fucking languages.  Is that what's going on?  What do I need to do?  Yeah,  yeah,  I got a Spanish  cleaning lady,  I tell her  just speak Spanish  to the kid.  Not one word of English. 
[00:34:00]  Hopefully it'll pick up  some shit.  It'll pick up some of that.  I don't know.  What are you supposed to do?  Do you give a man problems?  I know.  I would sit him in front  like one of them  clockwork orange screens  and play a bunch of shit  in front of his face  trying to pound  as much shit  into that brain  as he can.  Because it's creepy.  You tell him one thing,  I don't have an example,  maybe something  will come to mind.  You tell him one thing  and it's in there now.  That's weird.  It is really strange.  Are you very careful  about your language?  No.  No.  No.  Not really.  I mean,  sort of.  But I'm not panicking  about it,  I guess is the answer. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  If all of a sudden  I say fuck at home  and I'm like,  oh!  Has he blurted out a curse?  No, not yet.  Oh, man.  I'm kind of surprised  by that.  It is funny, man.  It is really funny  when a kid like curses.  Yeah, yeah.  And the parent's like,  oh, no.  No, no, no.  Yeah, it's great.  But so I got to figure out  what I shove in his little brain  before that part of it goes away.  Yeah, yeah.  I think by five  it slows way the fuck down, right?  Oh, hell yeah.  Then they just turn into dumb kids.  Just regular shit.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to tell them  a million times. 
[00:35:00]  But right now  you tell them something once  and it's in there.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  Teach him something  that will come in handy.  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't know what that is.  Teach him to drive right now.  Yeah, that'd be good.  That's convenient.  He could drive you around.  Well, he does get behind the wheel.  Does he?  That's nice.  Every time I park  he gets behind the wheel.  Does he steer?  He's going to be one of those kids  that just takes off  at five or six.  That's great  that it's like  because that's old school parent.  You know?  What?  You put the kid in your lap  and let him steer the car.  I remember my dad doing that. 
[00:35:30]  Me driving him home.  No, you psychopath.  We're not driving together.  I'm kidding.  Oh, okay.  But that's what like  I remember growing up though  and you're on your dad's  lap and he, you know,  you grab the steering wheel  and drive a little bit.  He drove a jet ski.  Yeah?  Yeah, for real.  Really?  Yeah.  Up in Soda's Point.  You put him up in front of you  and let him hold on to the handle?  Well, I wasn't allowed  because I don't have my license  so someone else did it.  Oh, man.  And he was steering  and hitting the gas.  That's pretty trustworthy. 
[00:36:00]  He was having a ball.  Yeah, you know.  Tweezing his old lady.  Sometimes you gotta  fucking toss the kid  to somebody else.  Well, no, no.  Get over that.  Not many people.  Yeah, I know.  Not many people get that.  No fucking way.  Jet ski.  Huh?  Yeah.  What, do you have  a little life jacket on  and stuff?  Tiny little life jacket.  Yeah.  He did a fucking  dumb little circle.  It wasn't like...  Put, put, put, put.  Yeah, it wasn't like  he was jumping waves.  Catching some air  with the kid on the front.  He did a little circle  and when he looks back  he'll, you know, 
[00:36:30]  he'll think he crossed  Lake Ontario or something.  That's another thing  I remember is  it had to be  it had to be before  I was even in kindergarten.  Yeah.  My dad would like  toss me on top  of the fucking gas tank  of his Harley.  What?  And drive  and I would ride  sitting on the gas tank  and I'd hold on  to the gas cap  because it was just giant  it was like a steering wheel  to me as a kid like that  and he would just  just fucking  flying down the road 
[00:37:00]  and I remember feeling  the heat of the motor  fear, fear, fear, fear  fear, the heat  I'd feel the heat  of the motor  and smell like  the fucking Harley  like motor  gasoline smell and stuff.  Were you scared shitless?  I do remember  an element of fear.  It had to be there.  Yes, yes  I do remember  an element of fear.  I've brought this up  many times  but I had a mini bike  accident when I was  12 or 13  to this day  I'm scared of  fucking motorcycles  and all that  I'm a pussy. 
[00:37:30]  I am not a motorcycle guy  maybe that's why.  I am a fucking pussy  and I remember  being in Geneseo  and one of the guys  that was a bouncer  at the in-between  he had a motorcycle  and he goes  I'll take you for a ride  you know  we were all like  near the bar or something  and I go  you know what  I gotta get over this fear  fuck it.  I think it was 19 or 20  so I get on the back of this  and of course  he had to be a fucking cowboy  and we're going  I want to say 100  I want to say 100  it was probably 70 or 80  to be honest  it felt like 100 
[00:38:00]  I was a little bitch  begging for him to stop  like a bitch  I couldn't even hold it in  and like try to be cool  and he was laughing  he thought it was hilarious  so he would go even faster  and I think that was  no I know  that was the last time  I've ever been on a motorcycle  that was it  yeah  my brother had a  he still has bikes  and I remember being on the back  and he would just yell at me  because I would never lean  into the turns  oh really  because I never understood 
[00:38:30]  the concept  it's like this thing's  gotta wash out on us  of course  how could you lean  so he's like  fucking lean  and I'm trying to lean  the other way  because I don't like  the bike leaning over  what a faggot  so yeah  I'm just not  motorcycle guy  I'm not motorcycle guy  this is how much  of a pussy I am  when I see motorcycles  on the highway  when I'm in my safe  quote safe car  yeah  I almost have panic attacks  for the people  it's crazy  I really do  I don't understand it  and there's sand 
[00:39:00]  on the road  you got a motorcycle  right there  yeah  I don't get it  sand on the road  and you're leaning over  it's like  that thing's gotta  just wash out on sand  well I mean  dry sand  you shouldn't be  going over  I know  I know  but sometimes  like even on the  shoulder of the road  a little bit  if somehow  you get over there  it happens  it's a weird  you just kinda have to  learn to trust the bike  and just like  look  it wants to keep  it wants to keep  going forward  and stay upright  the bike wants  to stay up  try to fuck with it  it wants you to keep  it wants to be upright 
[00:39:30]  the wheels are like  little gyros  so you kinda just  learn to trust it  after that  oh I can't  I can't  cause that dumb  thank you Harry Flood  cause Harry Flood  and his minibike  I've been scared  ever since  Harry Flood  that was his real name  too  I don't know  what ever happened  to Harry Flood  it was at the playground  at Washington Drive  Washington Drive School  I've told this story  many times  it's probably been  a few years  but I didn't  Harry goes  you know how to  ride a minibike  I go yeah I know 
[00:40:00]  sure  and you know the gas  I thought was the brake  what  and then I panicked  and I couldn't figure it out  on the fly  and so I'm going  faster and faster  and in my dumb little  12 year old  13 year old mind  I swear I was going 50  I was probably only going  20 or 30  I don't know  and I dumped the bike  into a sticker bush  classic story  to this day  I got scars  all over the place  from it  yeah  and then his poor  minibike is smoking  and pretty much  ready to explode  and I'm running home  crying  pissy eyed 
[00:40:30]  because we used to live  pretty close to  the Washington Drive School  and I had blood  everywhere from the  sticker bush  I was deep in it  oh man  deep in it  I thought it was  a fluffy little  like Bob Ross  type of bush  you reenacted  Steve McQueen's scene  in The Great Escape  where you tried to  jump over the barbed wire  yeah  ended up in it  there you go  on a minibike  but I remember all  like the monkey bars  and all that shit  flying by me  and the seesaws  and I'm like  I'm going to hit  one of these things  I got to get off  this fucking bike  and then I saw  these bushes  and I dumped it in there 
[00:41:00]  and it turned out  to be a sticker bush  the big ones too  where you're all out of  control  like oh shit  that's my memory  I don't even remember  anymore  I just remember  flying into the thing  that's frightening  because I don't even  think I actually  even jumped off it  I think I tried  to jump off it  but that wasn't  happening  I wasn't a fucking  stunt man  everybody's wrecked  a minibike  at some point  growing up  well I never got  on it again  you go too fast  and you realize  you don't have  any control  of the handlebars 
[00:41:30]  anymore  and you're just  waiting to crash  it's like  well I'm going to crash  it's just how bad  is this going to be  I had a slice  through my nostril  a slice through  my eyelid  completely  and then a massive  cut on the top  of my head  I had  I'd have to ask  my mom  but at least  30 or 40 stitches  at least  but the ones  that hurt the most  weren't the ones  they stitched up  it was all the  other scratches  when they fucking  healed and dried up  it was misery  they turned bright red  holy fuck  and just hurt  and then I would  just pick them  of course 
[00:42:00]  you have to pick  a scab right  well I  thank god  it stopped bleeding  I started thinking  I was a hemophiliac  Jesus Christ  you ever pick  a knee scab  remember when you  were a kid  you always had  those big huge  knee scabs  and then you felt  like you were  accomplishing something  if you could pull  off most of it  in one peel  you ever do that  yeah  I could never do that  I would get bummed  out if they were  too pussy  I needed  I needed them  to dry up  come on  you had to wait  the proper amount  of time  and then it would 
[00:42:30]  dry up just enough  where you peel it  and you see the  new skin underneath  it's not even  bleeding  it's nice  oh right  if it didn't  bleed  it's still  disgusting  but every once  in a while  you would peel  too far  and you know  you get to  the part  where it's  not healed  underneath yet  and then of  course  the whole  process  would start  again  because  it would  bleed  kids are all  scabby  oh man  I was scabby  when you're  growing up  you always  got a scab  did I ever  tell you the story  of my sister  who just panics  all the fucking  time  and I know  she listens 
[00:43:00]  to the show  and we were  delivering penny  savers  and my mom  would drop me  off as an  eight year old  because she was  only about  she was six  years old  she is six  years old  than me  so she was  about 14  and they would  drop us off  we couldn't get  the penny saver  route in our  neighborhood  so we had to  go three towns  over  and then my  mom and dad  thought it was  completely normal  to just ride  one bike home  I didn't even  have my own  bike yet  two years  on one bike  yeah so they  drop us off  with the penny  savers  handlebars  or seat  in the back 
[00:43:30]  yeah because  the penny  saver thing  you know the  rack  yeah the rack  on the back  so I'd run  around the  neighborhood  and we'd  deliver our  penny savers  we'd dump  a lot of  them like  anyone else  would  there was  always those  piles in the  woods  of penny  savers  and then it  was time  to go home  and she's  like you know  trying to be  the older  sister  she puts  me on the  back  and I  remembered  as a kid  as being  a monster  hill  that we were  going down  where she  panicked for  some reason  and went like  this with the  handlebars  once they  start going  back and  forth  and I  went flying 
[00:44:00]  off this  thing as an  eight-year-old  into traffic  I could have  been you know  that kid  yeah  oh boy  and had  huge scabs  on my knees  from this  thing  but the only  reason was  because she  panicked  yeah  and I  went back  years later  to see  this hill  I don't  you know  the road  to it  I don't  know the  name of  the fucking  road  maybe I  could  google map  it  so people  could laugh  at me  it was  the dumbest  tiniest  little hill  that she  panicked  on  that's  some big  completely  panicked  monstrous  hill  that you  remember  no  well I  thought  in my  mind  it was 
[00:44:30]  a  monstrous  hill  and that's  why my  sister  you know  dumped  me  you know  me off  the back  to save  her own  life  turns out  it was  a tiny  little  dumb  little  hill  and I  remember  we had  to go  to like  a  stranger's  house  because I  was  banged  up  bad  sure  come on  in  I'll  fix  you  right up  but this  is  something  that people  can relate  to that  you would  never allow  your kids  to do  nowadays  you would  take your  chances  and just  you would  just ring  the doorbell  of a strange  house  because you  needed help  and you 
[00:45:00]  don't even  know who's  behind that  door  it's like  the lottery  you could  get a  fucking  murderer  you don't  know  molester  or somebody  that's  going to  help  you  right  in this  case  you know  there's  no great  end to  the story  it was  someone  that was  a normal  human being  and gave  us refreshments  and you  know  cleaned up  the wounds  and bandaged  them  on our  way  that is  true  it's like  a fucking  first aid  station  right  like every  house  I took  a spill  off my  bike  as a kid  and I  remember  I was  just laying  there feeling 
[00:45:30]  all nauseous  right  and some  woman came  out of her  house  and like  brought me  into her  house  and she  got some  alcohol  on a rag  and put it  on my head  to cool  me off  yeah  and then  you know  I was like  you feeling  better  I'm like  yeah  okay  and then I  went along  my way  that's what  we did  it was like  a mash  unit  well I  mean  you know  our audience  is as old  as us  at this  point  god  I mean  I know  we get  some young  ones there  still  but  yeah  I mean  you've brought  it up  you would  leave your  house  with your  bike  and your 
[00:46:00]  friends  and you  would go  far  and you  wouldn't  come back  for hours  until the  sun was  coming down  yeah  so you  were on  your own  and yeah  if you  got hurt  you had to  find a  house  to take  care of  you  yep  you just  don't see  that  and bandage  you up  kids  big packs  of kids  on bikes  and just  walking around  that's the  creepiest thing  when I drive  around  where you  just don't  see kids  it creeps  me out  I'm like  where the  fuck  are they  they're  in their  house  with their  goddamn  computers  and their  cellular  phones  you couldn't  go down  the street  without seeing 
[00:46:30]  kids playing  like street  hockey  on their  bike  something  right  and you  just don't  see it  when you  drive around  neighborhoods  and shit  now  now  people are  petrified  it's the  news  it's gotten  everybody  petrified  you know  I'm one  of those  guys  though  yeah  yeah  I'm not  going to  just assume  and tell  my kid  to go  old school  unsupervised  yeah  I'm just  as paranoid  we go  exploring  in like  the woods  yeah  look for  fucking  salamanders  and that's  where all  the creeps  would be  hanging out  right  of course  why wouldn't  you hang  out in the  woods  if you  were a creep 
[00:47:00]  or the  creepiest  of the  creeps  yeah  the real  bad  creeps  would be  in the  woods  doing something  stupid  right  and yeah  our parents  didn't think  nothing of  yeah  oh you  want to  hang out  in those  woods  today  all right  we'll drop  you off  going in the  woods  yeah  going in the  woods  oh yeah  you're just  playing the  woods  like fucking  lord of the  flies  going in the  woods  lord of the  flies  god we've  said that a  million fucking  times  Iraq  you're asking  about where  the kids  are 
[00:47:30]  sometimes  they're not  even allowed  to be in  the parks  really  if there's  a group  of kids  just sitting  on a bench  or whatever  like that  you'll see  cops or  someone come  over and  say you  can't stay  here you  gotta move  they roust  them  yeah  they're not  allowed to  hang out  in the  park  all right  get a  move on  yeah they  close all  the parks  now too  yeah  so what is  I guess  where's a kid  to go  I don't know  I guess  well they have  play dates  which is the  dumbest thing  ever  even in  suburbia  though you  know driving  around where  I am  you just don't  you don't  really see it  well that's  what I'm  saying  I get out  of the  city that's 
[00:48:00]  what I'm  talking about  in the  city you  don't see  kids at  all in  the city  you see  newborns  and like  eight year olds  yeah  that's it  I don't know  where the  one to  sevens are  in between  or older  than that  unless you  go to the  playground  obviously  but I mean  just walking  around the  streets  you only see  newborns  and then  eight and  above  basically  yeah  that is  it  it's so  strange  to me  that is  odd  because yeah  growing up  it was  just what  you did  your parents  literally threw  you out of  the house  oh yeah  you were  fucking evicted  on a daily  basis  get out 
[00:48:30]  outside  we were  all assholes  yeah  every single  one of us  growing up  we were  all just  a bunch  of assholes  to our  parents  get out  of our  get out  of the  house  well that's  why my  you know  mom gave  us way  too many  chores  to keep  us out  of the  house  chores  I'd be  sitting  watching  television  in the  house  and  minding  your own  business  not bothering  anyone  I'm not  fucking  doing  anything  and then  they give  you busy  buddy work  it's not  even stuff  that matters  my mom  would come  over  just smack  the fucking  off switch  on the  TV  go outside 
[00:49:00]  right  oh god  I bet  she said  something like  this TV  watching isn't  going to get  you anywhere  in your life  yeah exactly  see  boy you  were wrong  it's all  I fucking  majored in  is TV  watching  right  but it was  yeah  that just  get out  of the  house  or when  me  Joe  and Dawn  used to  hear  on  Saturday  morning  Sunday  morning  Sunday  morning  this place  looks like  a bomb  hit it  that was 
[00:49:30]  a big  thing  and then  we'd be  sitting there  like little  slave children  with the  vacuum  and the  pledge  dusting  remember  dusting  you had  to dust  I've never  dusted in my  life since  12  where the hell  do we live  I don't know  what are we  mining  you just brought  up a memory  man  yeah the pledge  would come out  I kind of  like dusting  though  I'll be honest  with you  yeah that was  kind of fun  it wasn't the  heavy work  of vacuum  no I hated  vacuuming  yeah  I hated 
[00:50:00]  trying to  collect everyone's  laundry  vacuuming  I hated  doing the  dishes  but if I  was on  polished  duty  that was  kind of  cool  that pledge  would make  a little  and you're  like oh  alright  now I just  gotta wipe  that off  it smelled  good  made it  shiny  it was  kind of  cool  because it  made it  all shiny  that was  good  and then  oh sometimes  I'd have to  break out  the Bissell  Carpet Sweeper  the Bissell  Carpet Sweeper  and with  the squeaky  wheels  and his  fucking hair  all wound  around the  brutches 
[00:50:30]  it was  terrible  I hated  sweeping  too  yeah sweeping  sweeping was  a nightmare  because I  just couldn't  get it all  and that  bothered me  somehow  did you have  the little  shovel thing  and you'd  try to  whisk it up  and there was  always a little  line left in  front that you  could never  quite get  into the  little shovel  it was very  annoying  and then  the saving  phone call  would come  from either  my aunt  Fran  or one  of my  mom's  friends  because she'd  be just  like Gestapo  fucking  blurting out 
[00:51:00]  orders for us  what we're  supposed to do  like looking  over our  shoulders  dusting  and vacuuming  were you  scared of your  mom ever  it wasn't a  scared thing  I know where you're  going by the way  we'll get back to that  yeah yeah  it wasn't a  scared thing  like scared  of physical  thing  but it was  like you didn't  want to mouth  off because she  was going to  yell at you  really  if you mouthed  off  we were  petrified of  our mom  as most of  you know  she wouldn't  touch us  or anything  like that  but she  would she  could yell  really well  and make us  like you know  scared  yeah  shit like that  but then she  would let go  of all that  shit right 
[00:51:30]  yeah yeah  once the phone  rang and I'd  hear like you  know hello  hey how the  hell are you  it was always  how the hell  are you  hey how the  hell are you  yeah and  then we  we all just  looked at each  other went  oh god  a reprieve  because now  she's going to  talk to one of  her friends and  get in a good  mood and you  know shit  like that  and then there  was always  when she was  doing that  you could walk  up to her  and go  we're done  can I go  outside  and she'd do  that dismiss  you with her  hand thing  like not even  talk just kind  of get out  yeah I'm busy  now  and boy 
[00:52:00]  could not run  through that  screen door  quick enough  yeah  oh put the  vacuum away  first  yeah  yeah  yeah that's  that was my  childhood  yep  when I wasn't  you know crying  and being yelled  at by my dad  I was uh  cleaning up  I was a cement  worker  yes  I should have  been part of  the union  you had to  cement your yard  yeah  I gotta go back  to the old house  and show all the  cement work  because people I  don't think believe  me  I've wanted the  amount of cement  pictures of certain  things that we talk  about on the air 
[00:52:30]  the hill that I  burnt to me and my  brother burnt up  see we have the  exact same story  blamed it on the  black people  well we blamed it  on the oily rags  oh well  and my brother  whatever you want  to call  I took my brother  to a Yankee game  recently and he  he insists that  he he he uh  took the heat  for all of us  really  it's not true  but I know  I guess it's his  little thing  oh yeah  he said that he  started the fire  and that he got  in all the trouble  and we didn't  I I remember  we were fucked  well you don't 
[00:53:00]  you learn to lie  very early on  when you do shit  like that  well I started  by saying  because we just  learned in school  god we've  we've done  these stories  yeah I know  but they're kind of  fun to revisit  every so often  you know I learned  that oily rags  could start fires  spontaneous combustion  so when they had us  lined up in the  backyard with the  you know the  chief of police  and the chief  the fire captain  oh man  with sideways  police head on  oh my god  no no no  we were we were  charred  because we 
[00:53:30]  it was the days  when you always  wore a white shirt  a white t-shirt  really  remember those  days  we were a  Mormon  I don't know  maybe maybe  it was cheap  I don't know  five for a dollar  you know my mom  maybe it was just  us  but it was all  like soot and  stuff on our  faces and I  said oh we saw  some oily rags  in the woods  hoping they would  buy it  there's no way  anyone's thinking  that oily rags  in the woods  started a  spontaneous fire  I was what  maybe 10 or 
[00:54:00]  11  yeah  I don't know  like doc brown  yes  they were lining  us up in the  in our backyard  questioning us  as they were  still putting the  fire out and  hoping it didn't  catch on to the  onto the house  at the top of  the hill  wow  it got close  but we have a  very similar story  yeah yeah  down the woods  the fire  my brother was  the idiot  because we  were starting  the little  fires  in the  dry patches  of grass  no it was  just starting  fires in the  dry patches 
[00:54:30]  of grass  and I was  stomping them  out before they  would even get  like that big  the smell  a very  visceral smell  as a kid  is a burning  leaf  burning leaves  and burning  grass  I love the  smell of burning  leaves  it was like  and a match  lighting  like that shit  as a kid was  like a drug  you just couldn't  get enough of that  and I would  stomp it out  and then my  brother grabbed  my foot once  because he  wanted it to  get a little  bigger  of course  and that was  it  once it  a little  breeze 
[00:55:00]  it wasn't  even a big  gust to win  a little  breeze came  and that  fucking thing  whoosh  four feet  of fire  that's it  and then  yeah  we tried to  get a hose  I've told the  story before  but then we  you know  the fireman  showed up  and I was  like a little  kid  I was  again before  kindergarten  even  and he  you were  like four  yeah  and the  fireman  picked me  up  and said  what happened  here  and I said  I think I  said  negroes  I go  two  negroes  started  the fire  my dad's 
[00:55:30]  all proud  yeah  that's  great  that's  great  yeah  no we  we want  to make  our army  men  more  more  interesting  what  what  we were  just  bored  yeah  so now  we had  to set  them up  with fires  and stuff  and I  don't know  real fire  did make  army men  playing with  army men  really good  oh fuck  yeah  until that  molten  plastic  hit your  fucking  arm  like  actual  napalm  right  we would  we would  drip that  shit  on ours  what  I don't  know 
[00:56:00]  burnt like  a motherfucker  I know  I remember  though  we started  couch on fire  once and the  foam inside  was dripping  like dripping  fire  and a little  bit got on  my wrist  and I  I sounded  like that  little fucking  Vietnamese girl  just running  down this  running  I'd rip  my clothes  off and  just was  and my  friends were  just laughing  at me because  I was screaming  and agony  agonizing pain  right  it hurt  it wouldn't  stop hurting  the good old  days  like I needed  Sergeant Barnes  to take the

[01:01:30]  a lot  of people  checking in  about the  first hour  of radio  talking about  their mini  bikes  and saying  holy shit  same stories  here  this guy  Luke  using force  on twitter  I remember  falling out  of many  trees  it's amazing  how far  you can  fall  without  breaking  a leg  as a  kid  we didn't  even touch  on tree  climbing  which was  a huge  thing  growing up  behind our  house  we had  a lot  of  trees  and we  started  getting  more  and more  brave  yeah  that's what  happens  you get  a little  daring  you start 
[01:02:00]  going out  on the  branches  well the  pine trees  were easy  because you're  in the middle  of it  really  nothing could  really happen  to you  I mean the  branches were  so tight  you kind of  had to squeeze  through to keep  climbing up  but the worst  nightmare about that  you know how I  hate sticky  and the sap  that would be  on your hands  and it would  hit inside a  crease on your  hands so when  you bend your  hand and then  opened it up  you'd feel that  like stick  I can't deal  with that  inside the  elbow  like in the  crease and fold  of the elbow  if something's  sticky in there  I will go  bat shit  like it's a 
[01:02:30]  fucking Chinese  water torture  and I gotta  bring it up  again I don't  remember our  parents really  taking care of  us  you would leave  the house  you'd come home  with all sorts  of injuries  and you would  just try to  figure it out  on your own  I know  Brian Regan  does a bit  about the dirt  thing  leaves and dirt  on it  whatever  but remember  you would  put leaves  and dirt  on fucking  cuts and  stuff  just to  I don't  know  sop up  the blood  and get  some leaves  for the blood  remember you  would just get  poison ivy  you never really  went to your  parents with  that shit  that was  nothing  you would get 
[01:03:00]  horrible sunburned  you'd get  fucking nails  through your  feet  stepping on a  nail was one  of like the  most horrible  things I can  have it's like  a landmine  for a kid  you heard  stories about it  and then the  dreaded tetanus  shot that you  would have to  get  or else you'd  get lockjaw  and you just  imagined  like everybody  just had this  image  your dumb  kid mind  would have  all this  shit  right  lockjaw  yeah  do you remember 
[01:03:30]  getting your  supplies  I know we've  talked about  the fucking  forts  ad  but do you  remember like  you had to  fucking get  your own  supplies  and you  would  hammer out  nails of  old  projects  or wood  you found  around  and then you  would bang  the nails  to get them  straight  a bent nail  just as good  so you could  reuse them  making a tree  fort  and every once  in a while  you would  come across  gold  meaning you'd  be in the  woods or  something  and there's  a pile  of lumber  like what 
[01:04:00]  the fuck  seriously  fuck yeah  this is great  well we would  go to the  new developments  that were  popping up  all over  Long Island  and there  was always  something  laying around  that you  felt like  you could  take  how we were  able to  climb trees  holding lumber  and then nail  them up into  the tree  to start  your base  of a tree  fort  with no  engineering  whatsoever  you kind of  knew what  had to be  done  to build  the base  of the tree  fort  and your  parents never  helped you  out with  any of  this  you were  completely  separate  parents did 
[01:04:30]  their thing  kids did  theirs  they didn't  really hang  out together  kind of on  the weekends  a little bit  maybe  at the beach  or at the  local pool  or whatever  the fuck  it's fucking  great  I remember  that shit  now it's all  different  getting the nails  in the wood  a nice big  piece of plywood  for a floor  of a tree fort  was like  gold  remember using  rotting wood  going  I think  it'll be alright  it should be alright  we'll just put  more nails in it  just use more nails 
[01:05:00]  you'd have like  nails that weren't  quite long enough  to go through  the 2x4  into the tree  but you're just like  just use more  what else are we  going to do  we didn't find  long nails yet  and you trusted  that these things  you'd have  five of your  friends in a  tree fort  and you trusted  that the beams  that you put in  to hold the floor  up were going  to stay in this  tree  no building  codes  no  that many  tree forts  have just  collapsed  out of a tree  killing all  involved  I'm sure  the local 
[01:05:30]  authorities  now just  kind of  go through  the neighborhoods  and like  rip it down  you have a  permit for that  permit  breaking some  building codes  yeah  yeah we would  just hope for  the best  yeah  we were stupid  though we built  our tree fort  way too high  another thing I  remember being a  pussy up there  I was like this  is too high  wow that just  spurred a fucking  memory  and then we'd  have stairs to  a second level  like kind of  on the roof  wow that's a  pretty good one  but there was 
[01:06:00]  no walls  no you gotta  have  no exaggeration  I think our  tree fort was  at least 20  feet in the air  and 20 feet  as a kid  it might as  well be at the  top of a building  oh I know why now  because how the  trees were set  like they were  too wide at the  bottom and when  they finally kind  of came together  where we could  finally get like a  two by four in  that's where we  started  you didn't need  the two trees  or three trees  next to each  other  to span with  the floor beams  we had three  trees it was  complicated  the three tree 
[01:06:30]  was the best  no it wasn't  that was  complicated  you needed the  fourth tree  made it easier  as far as  oh four trees  would be even  better  but we had the  three tree thing  we had to  engineer that shit  we did a two  tree  no  yeah  that's impossible  you have to put  the beam across  like a cross  right  and then have  like a triangular  little braces  on the bottom  you knew how to  do braces  back then  oh yeah  yeah  we didn't know  braces  oh you had to  do the brace  or else it would  just teeter-totter  right off of 
[01:07:00]  we had no idea  how to do braces  it was frightening  it was  yeah  two tree cross  beam  yes see  other people  remember that  one  god that was  fucking creepy  though  I remember  going to  somebody else's  tree fort  it was always  weird going to  another person's  tree fort  it's like you're  visiting  yeah  hey come to  my tree fort  visiting someone  else's home  it was always  kind of cool  but weird  it's different  than yours  so it was weird  and felt weird  like you were  on somebody  else's turf  but then you  would come  back to your  boys in your  tree fort 
[01:07:30]  with some  knowledge  some new  ideas  you know how  was that  Johnny's tree  fort there  let me tell  you  they got  windows  windows  how do you  fucking make  windows  here's what  he did  I fucking  figured this  one out  I remember  the first  underground  I'll call  it a tree fort  those are  creepy though  underground fort  nah  it was  it was just  paneling  what do you  mean  just paneling  it was a big  hole with paneling  as the roof  yeah it could  cave in though  yeah what would  happen  the walls would  fall in on you  nothing would 
[01:08:00]  really happen  you'd suffocate  I think  I remember  it would just  be a tiny  little opening  but we  couldn't figure  out lights  so now  you're just  in the dark  just use  some fat  lamps  yeah  I think  what we  did was  we had  to move  the plywood  to get  enough light  in there  yeah but  that takes  away from  the illusion  now you're  not in  an underground  fort anymore  now you're  just in  a fucking  hole  you couldn't  find some  kind of  fucking  flashlights  no  very hard  to scrounge up  things as a  kid  were you a  hole digger  we obsessively 
[01:08:30]  dug holes  digging holes  and it was  never deep  enough  really  oh yeah  see that shit  gets dangerous  of course  well that's  mostly at the  beach house  when I was  growing up  my grandma's  beach house  we would  I don't know  it was definitely  in the sand  way over our heads  that's the most  dangerous  way over our heads  wow  I know  get killed like  that all the time  and it starts out  as a nice wide  hole but you know  it gets very 
[01:09:00]  narrow because  you can't take  out all that  sand  oh man  it starts  collapsing on  itself  it was a little  creepy to be  honest with you  but we did it  oh boy  we like to  dig in very  very deep  holes  oh boy  why don't you  talk about  tree forts  some kid had  a tree fort  that was so  fucking high up  and I remember  my brother went  up and then  I was like  yeah come on up  and it just  had it was  one of those  they had to  get up it  because they  took a bunch  of two by  fours that  were about  two feet wide  and nailed them  to the tree  as like a  ladder  and there  was so many 
[01:09:30]  of these  things  and I just  remember  I kept  climbing and  climbing  I'm looking  down  just going  I was  petrified  I remember  those two  by fours  whatever  they weren't  no they'd  rock  they'd move  to the right  or the left  so you had to  figure out  how to do  that with  your feet  to stabilize  it  yeah  and then  we found  those big  spikes  I don't even  know what  they're called  they might  even be  like railroad  spikes  yeah  and we  got like  the neighbor  who was older  than us  he was about  six years older  to hammer  those into  our tree  so now  we could go 
[01:10:00]  up like  it's a  like a  telephone pole  with like  big masonry  nails or  something  they were  massive  they weren't  going to  move  yeah  and that  was a good  day  we knew  we didn't  have to worry  about the  wobbly  wood anymore  for our  stairs  or our  ladder  our  makeshift  ladder  let's say  hi to  Liam  in  Atlanta  Liam  yeah  what's up  buddy  listen  I want to  tell them  about the  69 or  70  I found  my neighbor  in the  freezer  and daddy  had put  him in  the freezer  and I was  over there  trying to  get nails  and boards 
[01:10:30]  like he  was  underneath  his old  wooden  shed  and they  make a  real long  story short  well  make a  real long  story  we're  telling  innocent  childhood  fucking  stories  you found  a kid  in a  freezer  you found  somebody  in a  freezer  Jesus  Christ  fuck  this is  taking a  turn  we're talking  about  innocence  sir  my  goodness  what  happened  Liam  Liam  hey  there you  are  listen  was the  guy  dead  hey  listen  this is  what 
[01:11:00]  happened  when I  found  the  nails  and  what  not  I  told  my  father  about  what  I  found  David  over  there  and  the  little  freezer  over  there  and  once  the  law  and  everything  showed  up  I  thought  I  was  in  the  world  and  she  had  trouble  for  taking  the  males  to  a  tree  fort  but  I 
[01:11:30]  god  god  that's  that's  right  they  would  be  dead  in  the  woods  sure  they  would  be  at  the  bottom  of  pools  I  forgot  it  was  the  70s  60s  what did  you say  it was  a different  time  did you  just  actually  say that  you  got  what did  you say  exactly  the  70s  the 60s  late 60s  70s  go ahead  Liam  explain  yourself  anyway  no  I  go  over  there  to  find  the  nails  find  the  boards  and  what  not  because 
[01:12:00]  he  had  all  that  shit  playing  around  into  the  final  man  I  whatever  he's a  truck  driver  I  guarantee  it  Jesus  Christ  sorry  to the  truck  drivers  yeah  but 
[01:12:30]  we  all  know  well  anyway  that's  the  story  that  we  brought  back  end  of  story  no  right  you  but  you're  right  it's  late  60s  dead  kids  no  big  deal  you  guys  are  fucking  with  me  but  anyway  that's  what  do  you  do  for  living  Liam  you  know  what  I  do  for  living  you  already  named  it  trucker  I'm  a  long  haul  trucker  and  I  killed  people  across 
[01:13:00]  America  because  he  saw  that  now  he's  just  a  serial  killer  I  gotta  take  care  of  all  the  kids  yes  they  gotta  be  in  their  proper  place  they  need  to  be  cold  keep  fucking  with  me  yeah  yeah  yeah  I'm  punching  out  now  I'm  just  gonna  listen  y'all  have  a  good  time  y'all  have  a  good  time  first  time  I saw  a  dead  body  was  when  my  dad  died  that  was  it  first  and  only  wait  wow  first  and  only  let  me  think  yeah  yeah 
[01:13:30]  that's  it  yeah  yeah  never saw  a dead  person  did  you  uh  I've  seen  many  now  because  outside  of  oh no  I saw  people in wakes  and stuff  trying to think  of outside  of a wake  you ever see  one just  laying on  the fucking  ground  hell no  hell no  that guy  did  no big  deal  in a freezer  that's fucked  up  that's pretty  horrific  yeah I think that would fuck up my entire life  seeing that  that's one of those  defining moments 
[01:14:00]  that's a fork in the road  there  that's the alternate timeline  yeah  uh  Matt in Florida  so guys  hey uh  you guys are missing  the whole thing  the uh  back in the day  when you were doing  the tree forts  do you guys ever like  work on doing  the defense  of the tree forts  like  we spent months  and months  like  doing these tree forts  in the woods  down here in Florida  and we'd have like  we'd have these amazing  like you know  structures built  and like  these  kid bullies 
[01:14:30]  in the neighborhood  would just come around  and would just like  show up  and they're like  ah this is our fort now  oh yeah you did have to defend it  absolutely had to defend your shit  it was like a castle  yeah yeah  you brought rocks up into it  as your ammunition  yep  yeah  very good  pine cones  and then once we got to the point  where like  pine cones were a great weapon  oh my god  and then we'd move on  to like the BB guns  and like  we'd have these little  daisies  like  like little puny ones  and uh  we'd end up  start popping each other  with BB guns 
[01:15:00]  trying to get them out  of our fort man  it was  it was the  the time of our lives  it was amazing  time of our lives  yeah you know  all right  all right wonder years  thank you sir  you know what  the great uh  guidini  on twitter  fucking a yes  fucking igloos  oh yeah yeah yeah  that's all he wrote  we've never talked about  igloos on the show  yeah  used to make those  we used to live on um  25a  so the plows would come through  and pile up the shit  right near our mailbox  which made it a little scary 
[01:15:30]  because our igloo  was literally feet  from a highway  well you know  25a  it's a lot  it's not a highway  but a lot of traffic  oh that's dangerous  two-way road  that gets a lot of traffic  and uh  we would fucking  dig into that  because it would  that that snow  would be packed  yeah  and tight  and and just hard man  yeah you'd dig in  like a little tunnel  and then you'd start  like opening it up  inside the uh  when you first started  opening it up  it would be scary as shit  but then when you could  kind of see the  the sunlight coming  through the top  yeah you knew 
[01:16:00]  it was getting thin  thin enough where  if the thing collapsed  you'd be totally fine  yeah my dad made a good one  for me  and then stupid neighbor  sat on the front of it  and caved it in  oh  I was all mad  what'd you do to that kid  nothing  I just ran off crying  my igloo was broken  dad called me a faggot  that's pretty much the end  of every story I have as a kid  I ran off crying  dad called me a faggot  let's go to Chris in Iowa  Chris  Jesus Christ  yeah my dad used to work 
[01:16:30]  for the school system  so he used to move snow  and so he'd come  with the plow  and make a huge mountain  then we'd dig out  the tunnels  and then the big room  then we'd take the hose  from the basement  and spray water inside  so it'd freeze  that'd be like  the perfect igloo  wow you're smart  wow you really went  all out  I'm jealous  I don't think we ever  figured that one out  no  one of the bitchy  girls in the neighborhood  decided to start a fire  one time inside the igloo  and that didn't last  and she'd die 
[01:17:00]  she'd die  and they'd put her  in a freezer  it was the 70s  well no we just  left her out  yeah it was the 70s dude  we just left her there  until about April  then we could get her out  we talk about it again  and in the winter  you'd just come home  with frostbite  you wouldn't go to your parents  you'd go up  to a bathroom  and try to fucking  warm up your own limbs  remember putting the warm water  over your hands  and they were just frozen  and then it would hurt  get this intense pain  I don't know why  we never went to our parents  to try to figure half this shit out  they were busy  fucking drinking  or yelling or something 
[01:17:30]  they were like  you didn't want to deal  with your parents  they were like the boss  you know  only for the most important things  right  you gotta figure out yourself  yeah a lot of figuring out yourself  we were also  always trying to build  an ice rink  really  yeah  we were always  into hockey  the Gretzky family  the ice rink in the backyard  but we couldn't figure it out  we couldn't design it properly  we always would use boards  but the water would come through  they can be a liner  or something in there  we never were able to 
[01:18:00]  build the ultimate ice rink  that's when we used to have  winter in New York  yeah  where it was cold enough  where you could fucking  do some ice shit too  yep  first girl he fingered  was in a tree fort  aw  see to us  the tree fort  was always just innocent  I don't think we ever  had broads  no fingering  that's something that  my tree fort innocence  went away with Richard  that was the last  tree fort I ever constructed  and the last tree fort  you ever were  that is literally  you're right  the last tree fort 
[01:18:30]  I ever went in  he fucking  ruined that  he ruined tree forts  for me  that's like finding  the dead kid  in the freezer  right  no more tree forts  for me  no more tree forts  fuck that  when your best friend  offers to suck your cock  in a tree fort  your tree fort days  are over  this guy's messed up  for not freaking out  about a dead kid  in the freezer  yeah  pirate truckers  all freaked out  in Wisconsin  pirate  I cannot believe  that this 
[01:19:00]  what kind of upbringing  that this guy has  he goes over  to the neighbors  looks in the freezer  oh there's Billy  oh birds on the wall  that's what I was  looking for  and then goes home  yeah he goes home  and is worried  he's going to get  in trouble  for stealing nails  and he saw a dead kid  in a freezer  you're right  I'd be afraid  that I'd get in trouble  for throwing Billy  in the freezer  right  the parade  of dead hookers  on his route  oh my god  I'm sure  what was in his  basement  that he's just like 
[01:19:30]  oh dead people  that's okay  yeah  I would be  running from the house  screaming  I would be creeped out  when we came across  like a dead bird  in the woods  yeah yeah  and this kid saw  a dead kid  in a freezer  when I saw Smokey  all covered in  fucking maggots  my cat Smokey  on the road  that freaked me out  I still think about that  yeah  oh Smokey  poor Smokey  story about Frostbite  we got  Tree 4 with upside down  garbage  Ken with unique  what  Ken with unique heating 
[01:20:00]  where they pile  the garbage on the top  to warm up the place  what  I don't know  let's try this guy  Dennis in Westchester  I don't know  what you want to say  I don't know  because she could  understand when I called in  you took an upside down  garbage can  and we had it notched  and we built  put wood inside of it  underneath the tree fort  light a fire  we checked it  some kind of old  duck through the middle of it  to bring it up  through the middle  to give us heat  when it was cold outside  are you guys crazy?  are you going to die  a carbon dioxide person?  apparently  and then you were talking  about lighting it  before we take  two rusted nails 
[01:20:30]  against the wall  and wedge a candle  in between  and light the candle  that was  oh right  okay  yeah yeah  the dangerous  candle holder  in a wooden  fucking dried wood  tree fort  I knew my boy  had the garbage  candle  but it heated  he's talking about  the underground shit  you put a candle  in there  really?  that's kind of smart  I like you  you heated your shit  yeah  we weren't that involved  thank you racist  Francesa  not like  anything  fire under your  tree fort  okay  light a fire 
[01:21:00]  under your tree fort  that's brilliant  well in the garbage can  well of course  alright thanks guys  I'm great  oops sorry  great  Guedini  who I just  read his tweets  and I asked a call  he's going for the  double today  what do you got buddy?  yeah when you got  older  the igloo  was a double thing  you could tell your  parents you were  building an igloo  but then you could  go in there  and as long as you  made the opening  away from the door  go in there  and smoke a little  weed without your  parents knowing  who's smoking weed  what's wrong with you 
[01:21:30]  how old were you?  you turned your  childhood innocence  into a drug den  yeah  yeah absolutely  you fucking hippie  no it was all about  just fun and games  nothing  nothing crazy like  fingering girls  or fucking  smoking your weed  you were smoking pot  at 13  out in California  well  yeah  no I was smoking  when my brother  got out there  it was a little later  I think like 15  yeah 
[01:22:00]  I stole his pot  and got all fucked up  there you go  and then that went  my whole school career  went right down  the shitter at that  point  I was actually doing  pretty good  tell you the truth  I wasn't doing  too shabby  you didn't miss  anything  until I started  smoking pot  you didn't miss  anything  no  no  what if I wanted  to be like  a fighter pilot  kind of ruin  that whole thing  I would have  had to go  to like  you know  the academy  know some  fucking math  finish high school  true  and I couldn't  be fucking  top gun  I wish 
[01:22:30]  sucked  I wish I was  more like you  growing up  I would have  said fuck school  and smoked pot  I was too  paranoid  but then  what DJ  would you have  found that  was  doing a show  I don't know  love of God  I thought school  was a waste of time  I gotta shut my mouth  obviously  if you listen  to this show  Paul in Tennessee  what's up  hey there Paul  hey  as I like to say  back in the day  in the 70's 
[01:23:00]  I'm from Maine  and my brother  and I used to  walk to school  and literally  it was three and a  half miles  one way  and it's winter  time in Maine  it's like 15  degrees below zero  you get to school  you couldn't breathe  because your lips  are frozen over  your nostrils  are frozen over  you couldn't move  your hands  because they were  frozen  it was just  how about frostbite  you just stood  in front of the van  it's the first class  took the entire  first class  to get all that  stuff off of you  it was just  awful  they never  canceled school 
[01:23:30]  never canceled school  well Maine  fuck  well you just  brought up  in memory  when we were  growing up  none of us  had like  winter boots  really  did you have  winter boots  we didn't really  have them  sorry  yeah  it's me again  I had those ones  with the clips  like  like all the  little clips  running down  we were too  poor  we were poor  so we would  put the  stupid bread  bags  you don't  know this  one  you had  your bread  bags  over your  you don't  know this  one  wow 
[01:24:00]  I know  I'm not  the only  one  fucking  Oliver  twist  you would  put the  I'm trying  to remember  yeah you  would put  your socks  on first  then you  would put  the bread  bags  over your  socks  then get  into your  sneakers  wow  yep  and that  was supposed  to keep  your feet  from getting  wet  and it  would keep  you a little  warm too  because the  heat would  kind of  not escape  as much  wow  I know  I'm not  the only  one  and then  he brought  up a memory  I remember  when we did  have like  cold toes  or cold  fingers 
[01:24:30]  we would  use the  exhaust  coming out  of cars  to warm  up  nice  did you  ever do  that  no  and I  that's  something  I haven't  thought of  in years  if a car  was  I don't  know  obviously  a car  has to  be running  for whatever  reason  maybe you're  at the  stores  let's say  yeah  people running  in but  their cars  are running  I'm trying  to remember  exactly how  this worked  but I  remember doing  it and  we'd put  our  frostbitten  fingertips  near the  exhaust  because that's  blowing out  some heat  yeah  to get  a quick  warm up 
[01:25:00]  out in that  snow  and slowly  it would go  from like  your pinky  toe would  just disappear  right  and then  it would  just spread  along the  front of  your foot  man you  used to be  outside until  you were  just freezing  to death  you were  literally  freezing to  death  before you  came in  the house  what are you  doing  taking shit  off by the  door  don't  track  snow  at the  house  right  all right  my bread  bag people  are coming  in  cool  I'm not  the only  one  thank god  see 
[01:25:30]  and I  gotta take  one call  for this  sorry  Brian  Long Island  go ahead  what's up  I grew up  a poor  white trash  boy  in Wontaw  and my  mom not  only made  us wear  a bread  bag  they were  from the  thrift bread  store  not even  wonder bread  no it  was like  some kind  of no  name bread  that was  five days  old and  we'd feed  the bread  to the  ducks  and we'd  have to  wear the  baggies  on our  feet  you didn't  do this  ever  no  I had  like boots  every winter  we'd go  shopping for  winter stuff 
[01:26:00]  for school  stuff  and at the  beginning of  fall  we'd go and  get everything  we needed  for winter  so it would  be like  the boots  the fucking  your raincoat  the old one  where every kid  looked like the  Gordons of  Gloucester  fishermen  because that's  the only raincoat  they had  was the yellow  one  sure  we didn't  have that  either  what  no  would you  have big  plastic bags  we had  coats  I remember  we had coats  that soaked  up everything  yeah  maybe because  they were  cheaper  but you  know what  I learned 
[01:26:30]  that we  weren't as  poor as I  as I  portray it  no  no my mom  had a money  thing  oh really  so I think  she could  have afforded  some of  this shit  that I talk  about  but she  was so  crazy  about  money  that we  were  going to  run out  of money  money  money  money  thanks  we're  all  going to  be on  the street  that she  held back  a lot  of stuff  I'd say  gee thanks  why did  we have  to suffer  then  we were  definitely  you know  we were  definitely  poor  but I  think  she  could  have  afforded  a lot  of  stuff  I've  learned  that  over  the  years  she  was  hoarding  money  my mom 
[01:27:00]  was a hustler  she was  hoarding  the little  money we had  is what I'm  saying  huntington  and shit  like that  and then  maybe she  was hooking  what was that  about  she was  hooking  or selling  drugs  I have  no idea  how many  Mets did  she go out  with  don't bring  that up  again  scariest day  ever  that was  funny  yeah 
[01:27:30]  are we done  with this  yeah  I guess  set up  ramps and  driveway  to see how  many garbage  cans  they could  jump  yeah  that never  worked  on that  because  your stupid  ramp  would turn  into a  seesaw  if it  wasn't  built  properly  ammo  for tree  forts  having  huge  splinter  in his  foot  old  fridge  box  was  the  best  for  forts  there  was  the  basic  yeah  splinters  were  a great  injury  that was  a common  kid  injury  and then  there  was also  this  was  dreaded  your 
[01:28:00]  foot  caught  in  the  spokes  of  a  bike  yeah  I  remember  seeing  the  result  of  that  there  was  a  girl  that  was  riding  on  the  back  of  someone's  bicycle  and  that's  when  it  would  try to  keep  her  feet  away  from  that  and  they  ended  up  going  into  the  spokes  and  just  tore  her  fucking  foot  apart  that  was  like  common  also  flying  off  the  handlebars  when you'd  have  someone  riding  on the  handlebars  why would  you have  someone  riding  on the  thing  that  steers  your  fucking  bicycle  I hated  people on  the front  of the 
[01:28:30]  fucking  bike  like that  it's  terrible  remember  getting  your  pant  leg  stuck  pant  leg  stuck  in  the  chain  and  that  would  stop  your  bike  instantly  whip  around  you're  almost  breaking  your  fucking  bone  because  the  pedal  would  come up  on the  other  side  of your  foot  on the  back  side  of your  calf  how many  times  did you  get your  shin hit  ow  ow  ow  fuck  stupid  god  yeah  why didn't  god give us  a little  meat  where the  shin is  that was  the worst  all right

[01:35:00]  you  you  you  that  you  you  you  I'm not getting rich  Rich boss has joined the show  When Rich starts his appearance  By talking about microsurgery  Putting this finger over here 
[01:35:30]  Oh boy  Well, the funny thing is  You know, we've told our childhood stories  Many times on this radio show  But I think me and Ann  We didn't even discuss it ahead of time  We chose to tell it this time  Tell these stories with an innocence  Like our childhood innocence  So with the guy calling  Saying he found a dead kid in the freezer  And then Rich comes in here  Yeah, my friend fucking cut all his fingers off  Cut his fingers off on a radio alarm saw  And he had to be helicoptered  With his fingers in an ice bag 
[01:36:00]  And they put this finger  What?  They mixed his fingers up  Because the way they were cut  They couldn't put him back  They were too severed to put him back  Where they were supposed to go  But wouldn't that be the logical way to do it  If it was cut this way  Then you could put it back that way  Listen, I'm not a microsurgeon  No  I'm barely a comic  Okay  So all I know is  He's not laying there  Arguing  Hey, just get these fingers back  I mean, he looks  It almost looks like 
[01:36:30]  Have you seen him since?  Oh, yeah, yeah  And they have  Does he have all the fingers?  Or are they  No, he has  He misses like one and a half  And a couple of them  On the wrong finger  Bending the wrong way  I think they fucking took a toe  And put it on his  No  But they did  They just  I think I'd rather have no fingers  It's just  No, but his hand works  His hand works  To have this finger over here  Like, how much of the fingers were got?  How many knuckles?  Well, on the saw  He cut it down on an angle  Okay, it was a good angle 
[01:37:00]  If you're doing molding  Yeah, yeah, yeah  How the fuck did he do that?  How did he have his hand on the fucking  How?  Yeah  Let's say alcohol  Oh, okay  All right  Look at most woodshop teachers  You look at  Are missing one or two  Yeah, they really are  Yeah  That's their lives  That's why the woodshop teachers  You know  Yeah  But he was like  Kind of in shock  But he put that  That burden on this little black kid  Go get me a bag of ice  And you see all these fingers  On the floor  And now he has to 
[01:37:30]  Were you there?  No  No  Because I would have  Fucking laughed at him  Stuck kicking the fingers around  He's the same guy  When we were smoking crack  Oh, okay  I'm so glad  We went from childhood  Yes, yes  Smoking crack stories  No, it's cool  We were in  Harlem  And we just  Of course we were  We just bought crack  Me and him  And he's  In the passengers  And he took a hit  That was so big  I mean  And he just  Opened the car door 
[01:38:00]  And fell out on the ground  I go  He's like my best friend  I go  He's fucking dead  I go  I'm gonna have  Three extra vials  Fucking addict  And then he  He started breathing  And I went  Fuck  That  You were a good  Fucking crackhead  Hey, listen  You know  You gotta  Look out for number one  Hey, you had a good hit  Sorry  Your run's done  Yeah  Wow  It doesn't mean  Damn it  Hey, uh  Did you see Robert Blake

Hold on  One hour a week  Fuck you  Try 20 hours a week 
[01:42:00]  Then come talk to us  Try doing it for free  Oh well  Okay  That's pretty much what we're doing  I gotta show you  This is what  Scumbags  I hope somebody  Did you bring a bid in?  No no  This is the proof  Yeah I brought a bid in  Yeah  I'm fucking Brian Regan  Donuts  No  Although he's one of my favorites  He's well prepared  We like to say  Yeah  He's one of my favorites  I'm not trashing him  By any sense  He sells out theaters 
[01:42:30]  And I'm trying to fill  Uncle Vinny's this weekend  Well that's a tax form  No you gotta see  This is what scumbags  The traffic  Where do they  You know  The meter people  The traffic people  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Those fucking scumbags  I hope somebody's listening  That can straighten this up  I'm not fucking around  What happened?  Bonnie  Okay  Follow us  Bonnie pulls up on Broadway  Mmhmm  She's right  By the Mooney meter  Muni meter  Whatever the fuck it's called  The Mooney meter 
[01:43:00]  Yeah Paul  It's the Mooney meter  Hi  Put some money in the Mooney meter  Hey cracker  Put some money in this  Right you fucking queen  The Muni  What's it  Muni meter  Yeah yeah  It's called Muni  I guess  Have a Muni meter  She pulls up  In front of the Muni meter  The kid's in the car  She gets out  To buy the ticket  And put it in there  Mmhmm  So one of these guys  Come over to traffic fuckers  And starts to write her ticket  And she goes  Whoa whoa  I'm doing this right now 
[01:43:30]  How else can I do this  But get out of the car  Yes  To do it  I'm so fucking glad  You're bringing this up  Because it's another  New York City fucking scam  Holy shit what a scam  Hold on  Because I got  I understand  But let me  I'm going to paint  The picture for the people  Oh  So they got rid of  All the meters  Yeah  So you have to go to  One machine  The Muni meter  Thing  Maybe down the street  To spit out the fucking ticket  Thank you  People need to know this  It's way down the street  And they do that on purpose  So these fucking assholes 
[01:44:00]  Could come around  And write tickets  Before you get back  To your fucking car  Okay  They're not close to your car  And in some cases  They're a solid city block away  But this case  She got a spot  Right by it  Wow  That's even more  Wow  So she gets out of the car  To go get the ticket  He comes up  Getting ready to write a ticket  She goes what are you doing  I'm paying  I got a kid in the car  What am I  He goes  Okay  Don't worry about it  I'll let you slide  So she goes on her business 
[01:44:30]  Puts the receipt in there  He goes  Well two months later  I get a fucking notice  From Department of Motor Vehicle  Late payment  Okay  He wrote her the ticket  And never gave her a copy  Oh boy  He wrote her  For real  I got it right here  I got it right here  That we never got the ticket  How do you got a copy right here  I got a copy  If you never got a copy  Send it in the mail  No no  I got a copy of the late ticket payment  Right  Okay  He wrote her a ticket 
[01:45:00]  See the reason he didn't give it to her  Because she would have had the receipt  As proof  Because there's a five minute window  Right  Okay  So he wrote the ticket  Just kept it  And then turned in his side  Motherfucker  So we get a thing going  Late payment  Because now you don't have the ticket  Now you didn't save the fucking  No we didn't save the ticket  Not only that  We didn't save the receipt  Right exactly  Okay  Because if we would have saw him  Giving us a ticket with a receipt  Save the receipt  Well she didn't think  She was getting the ticket  No I'm saying  I'm just saying  So this scumbag  And you know what 
[01:45:30]  I made a complaint  Nothing happens  It's just  You know what it is  You can't fight City Hall  No but  They don't give a care  But this guy  Why is this guy still working for  For you know  Because he's raking in money  For the city  He's probably one of their best  Fucking easy workers  Exactly  Yeah  You don't understand this shit yet  It's a scam  And it's being perpetrated  On us by the New York City government  It's a complete scam  But if  They don't give a fuck man  Their whole paycheck  Is based on how many tickets 
[01:46:00]  They write a day  They get bonuses  Fuckers  Fuckers  And they know that  They can hand in these tickets  And it's going to be  His word against yours  You're going to lose  Almost every time  Almost every time  What a prick  I never gave a ticket  I swear to God  If I ever run into him  Wait  So what's the law  What's the law  So he's  No he's writing a ticket  She's saying  I'm getting  You know  My parking ticket  Or whatever  So what's the  What's the actual law  No no  The law is  He said  I won't write you the ticket  But he already wrote it 
[01:46:30]  He wrote it  But he didn't let her know  And give her a copy  Okay  If he would have wrote the ticket  And gave her a copy  She would have taken the receipt  And sent a copy of the receipt  Because you have a five minute window  So now wait  You've got a five minute window  So if he wrote the ticket  At 10 a.m.  And your receipt says  10.05  You're okay  Yes  So if you see somebody  Writing you a ticket  Why not just run to the muni meter  And get a fucking ticket  Like if you see a guy  Writing you a ticket  And you're like  Fuck I just parked there  For two seconds  Yeah  Grab a muni meter thing  Yes  And now you'll be able to fight it 
[01:47:00]  Yeah  Because you have a five minute window  I don't think that's true  I don't either  I would bet money on that  I guarantee there's a five minute window  I would bet money on that  I don't think so  I don't think so either  I've never heard of that  I don't think so  They're not going to make it  That easy for you  Yeah  No way  That does sound like  A fucking convenience  Yeah  Another time this guy  Had a ticket on his car  And he saw me pulling away  Still you go  He saw me pulling away  He goes  Can I have your ticket  So I gave him my ticket  Because this way he has  He could say  Well they didn't see it  He has  You know  Because he was right across the street  Oh okay 
[01:47:30]  So I gave him my ticket  Which saved him  Maybe it's coming back to me  Yeah that's probably  That's what happens  It's karma  It's a complete scam  That brings in a lot of money  For New York City  So they're not going to  Listen to us at all  Well but don't  I have a video that I did  Of a delivery truck  I think it was Coca-Cola  Right outside our building  So it was around 10 a.m.  And I saw them getting written up  For parking illegally  But they already had  I'm trying to remember  Like two other parking tickets  In the window  Mm-hmm  So I talked to the guys 
[01:48:00]  And like oh  This is our eighth of the day  I'm like when did you start working  He goes oh two hours ago  They just collect them all day  Cost of doing business  That's what the city says  But how are they supposed  To deliver their shit  Yeah it's fucking  I know  You know what it is  They're supposed to find  Legal parking somewhere  And then haul their soda  Or whatever the fuck  They're delivering  To the place of business  That's crazy  That's crazy  They have in their budget  How many tickets  They're going to get  But it only raises the price  Okay so their company 
[01:48:30]  Doesn't  It's passed on to the consumer  My point is  It's the biggest fucking scam going  And no one talks about it  I do  I'm bringing it out in the open  I would  And then we get the other side sometimes  And people go  Well these trucks  They block the fucking road  Alright in that case  Write them a ticket  In a lot of cases  That's not what is happening  If they're not blocking  The fucking road  Yeah  And now also  These motherfuckers  They don't have to sit there  And write anything  They go up to your registration  In your windshield  And go  Bleep  They scan it 
[01:49:00]  And that's all they gotta do  All the information's there  That's why it's not like  It takes them long to write  They could just sit there  And go bleep bleep bleep  Rip it out  Fucking pop it in your windshield  If they do that  You know why that started  Fake license plates  Because these meter maids  I call them meter maids still  They're illiterate  Well probably that  But also  The fear of being punched in the face  As you're writing that long ticket  As someone is pleading their case  Yeah  I'm sure there's been a lot of issues  Would probably make  A lot of these guys go  You know what  I can't write this ticket  The guy is on his way already 
[01:49:30]  So they want to make it  As quick as possible  Once it's scanned  They can't do anything about it  Even if they wanted  When they were writing it down  Even if you had  The greatest excuse  And they decided  Not to give you the ticket  They could do that  Just void out the ticket  Or whatever  But now once they hit  That scan thing  It's done  It's in their system  My chick got a parking ticket  In the Long Island Railroad  Parking lot  Because she didn't  Pull into her spot  Head in  Oh yeah  It's head in only  And she didn't do it 
[01:50:00]  It was a hundred dollar ticket  A hundred and five dollars  Well the five dollar surcharge  Head in  What is that about  I don't know  You're not allowed to  You're not allowed to  Back into your parking spot  So they could tow your car easier  No  It would make it more difficult  Yeah  So why is it  I don't know  It's just tax  Just because they want to get you  At every turn  Nassau can be taxed  Just to give one more opportunity  For you to fuck up  Right  So they could soak you  Well there's probably bushes behind  Where you pull in  And they don't want to exhaust  That's what they say  At my townhouse  At my townhouse 
[01:50:30]  We're not allowed to back in  What do they say  At your townhouse  Don't burn it down  They say  Don't park your car  On your balcony  Rich Voss has an update  I know  Because we hang out a little bit  He's back in his old house  Oh  Yes I am  And are your neighbors  Very unhappy about that  They're not there  Some are renting their place  The other one  I don't know  I mean  If the people don't know  Because we do get  New listeners all the time  And then we also get people  To say  Fuck you guys  But it bounces out  In the end I think  You burnt down your condo 
[01:51:00]  And now you're finally  Back in there  We didn't burn it down  It burnt down  No I think you guys  Burned it down  I couldn't have  I was 3,000 miles away  True  So  Good alibi  Huh  You have a good alibi  It's weird  You can't be better  I was across the country  But do you know  How suspicious that is  To detectives  Having that really good alibi  Makes people go  Wait the fuck  A little too good  Wait  That's a long fuse  Yeah but you might have  Been able to set some things up  Before you left  That's what a detective  Would say 
[01:51:30]  One of the detectives  Said  This is no lie  He said  Well  Because we had a dry plant  On the balcony  He said  Well there was  A meteor shower  I go  If you  Don't want to be  Riddle cued  Riddle cued  Riddle cued  I go riddle cued  Could you add that  And the moonies  And the moonie meter  And riddle cued  Wait  How do you spell riddle  Riddle  Alright  R-I-D-D-L-E 
[01:52:00]  Oh that's great  And then you go with  Riddle cued  Cued  C  Alright  Yeah yeah  Wow that list is great  So uh  Yeah  I go  If you want to say face  Don't ever go back  To the fucking precinct  And say I think it started  From a meteor shower  A meteor shower  He was trying to help you out though  Huh  He was trying to help you out  Could have just been  Some fucking floating bit of  Fiery ember  These all  You know what I noticed  All kids that walk around  The apartment  Are hanging  And they flicks  They're dirty 
[01:52:30]  They litter  Someone flicked  A fucking cigarette  Flicked their cigarette up there  Up there  Started a fire  All right listen  We've done the ticket  Bit on our show  Many times  But this is a  Very unique phone call  And then we can move on  Rob in Brooklyn  Go ahead Rob  How you doing  So I'm a fuel director  And uh  I was in the city  Pulling a body  What yeah  Thanks for running  Anything  So I'm pulling a body  From Manhattan  And there's no spot 
[01:53:00]  So I'm in a removal vehicle  I have a plaque  That says  I'm a licensed fuel director  Pulling a body  I pull the stretcher out  Because I had a double part  In front of this apartment building  And when I come out  With the body  A guy is writing me up a ticket  Telling me that I had to  Find a legal spot  Now when I went to court  To fight this  The judge said  I should have found  The legal spot  And when I said  I should have brought  The body around the corner  Through the city  Or in this spot  I said  What the fuck 
[01:53:30]  Is that all about  That's the rule  Sorry  Yeah technically  It's the rule  You know  And that's how  The city sets it up  But I mean  Come on  Don't you guys  That's ridiculous  Or riddle  Riddlecule  Riddlecule  Riddlecule  Riddlecule  Riddlecule  Yeah  Can't even figure it out  Because fuel directors  Because fuel directors  A fucking dentist  Gets a special place  To park anywhere  For an emergency  For a fucking root canal  But a fuel director  Doesn't have a special plaque  That's accepted by the city 
[01:54:00]  Yeah  So they can park illegally  So what do you  Bang out that  Bombing  So what's the big rush  To get the body  Anywhere  Anyhow  What was that  He's not in a rush  I go what's the rush  To get the body  I think it's more about  Horrifying everybody  Oh you mean walking  With a dead body  To your legally parked  Fucking hearse  Like weekend at Bernie's  You're just fucking  Carting them around  And you don't have  You know  Clergymen get special  They can park anywhere  And you can get online  Online you can become 
[01:54:30]  A clergyman  Yeah a clergy  What am I  What am I  A rabbi  Oh shit  Always goes to  Anti-Semitism  A clergyman  Is not only a rabbi  It's  You know  Alright Rob  Thank you  Nah the city  Just tries to screw you  As soon as you wake up  In the morning  They're trying to get  Money out of your  Fucking pocket  Yeah but do it  Legally at least  I mean if you're  Going to give tickets  Oh it's all legal  Technically it's all legal  It wasn't legal  What he did  True 
[01:55:00]  And then they get away  With some shit  You know so be  If you're going to do it  Be legal  Okay I broke the law  I deserve to pay  There's a great episode  Of Louie  I don't know if it aired yet  Because we got to see  The first five episodes  Of the parking signs  In New York City  Where you can't even  Fucking read them  And they do that  On purpose  So they can write  More tickets  It used to be  A couple feet  Away from hydrants  They have made that  I think it's almost  20 feet now  It's a huge  Fucking distance  That makes no sense  Whatsoever  Well what it is  Is it takes away  More legal parking 
[01:55:30]  Which forces you  In desperation  To maybe squeeze  Into a spot  That's not legal  So they can write you  Up for tickets  It's all about  Writing tickets  In Brooklyn  When I was living  In Brooklyn  I used to park  In front of my building  And sometimes  I swear to you  Just the bumper  Of my vehicle  Was a little further  Toward the corner  How many inches  That it was supposed to be  What did you say  The bumper itself  So six inches  Four to six inches  And they had the crosswalk  Where the little ramp  Would go down  Off the sidewalk  For the handicap thing  And if you're even 
[01:56:00]  Six inches near that  They wrote you up  But it's like  Realistically  I'm not blocking anybody  But that happened to me  But hold on  The point being  That parking spot  Yeah  Is just too short  And they do that  On purpose  So you go  Oh who the fuck  Would give me a ticket  For being six inches over  Obviously it's a space  Nah  That happened to me  In New York  The bolt of my license plate  The head of the bolt  Are you kidding  Was hanging over  I don't know if you're kidding 
[01:56:30]  Because these guys are assholes  It's funny Rich  Rich is a big golf guy  And it just reminded me  It's not big  I was hanging out  With some people  Up in Sotus Bay  Sotus Point  In Rochester  Beautiful area  And we were talking  About golf a little bit  And the people  I was hanging out with  They know a guy  That's  He's a big scumbag  And his scam was  And it made me  Fucking howl  He would pull up  To golf courses  And you know how 
[01:57:00]  Everyone leaves  Their golf clubs out  Yeah  You know  In front of the  Like the clubhouse  Yeah  He'd pull up  And just  Fucking take  Golf bags  Yeah  What  Sorry I'm laughing  Through it  He would pull up  Like the biggest scumbag  In a really nice car  So no one would  Even question it  Oh man  Make him believe  He's picking up  His golf clubs  And he would  Throw them in his car  He would throw  The nicest pair  He could fuck  What a prick  Because you assume  You know  No one's gonna  Fuck with your shit 
[01:57:30]  You would assume  No one would  Right  Ask you  Are those your clubs  Wow  What a scam  I knew two heroin addicts  That did that shit  Yeah when we were  Who was the other one  He's dead  They would pull up  To Plainfield Country Club  Wow  Which  And they were  You know  All of a sudden  They're coming over my house  They go  You want these clubs  They're like  Fucking Wilson staff  Back then  That's what you  I don't want  I'm not buying them  Because  You can go to jail  For buying them  More or less  Staling them  But yeah  That's a fucking 
[01:58:00]  What a great scam  Wow  That's fucked up  When I was doing  I've told this story  But when I was doing  Coke and crack and stuff  I would go to garage sales  And buy  Like the oldest  Rusty clubs  That were like  Five dollars  I'd buy a bag  And then I'd go to  A drug dealer  And go  Look  You know  I'll leave you  My golf clubs  As collateral  I go  I have to  You know  I gotta play golf  I go  That's all  I go  Holy shit  That's all I got  That's all I got  Brilliant  Collateral  And I'll be back 
[01:58:30]  You know  Monday  Or after I get paid  And of course  Fuck that  And they never see me again  They get shitty clubs  That cost less than the drugs  Would have cost  They cost five or ten dollars  That's fucking great  Are you worried that  Someone you owe money to  Is gonna run into you someday  I know it's been on  Many many years  But were you paranoid  About that for a while  No because  They were older  So they gotta be really old  Either dead  Or in jail  Yeah I mean I know  It sounds like you ripped off  A few people  When you were  I got ripped off too  You know  Well that makes it all better  It's just 
[01:59:00]  I only owe one guy money  This guy Frank  I don't want to say his last name  I think I owe him 700  But here's the thing  Once you put it in your hand  Come on  You know  It's part of the game  You know  It's part of the game  You're constantly trying to  Fuck each other over  Oh really  As they're holding it out  Out a window by your ankles  Just say hey  It's part of the game  The drug dealer wants to  Get your money  Without giving up his drugs  You want his drugs  Without giving him the money  That's pretty much  What everyone's goal is here  And you try to meet  In the middle somewhere  Where you're actually getting 
[01:59:30]  The drugs for the money  But sometimes it goes  One way or the other  A little bit more  One guy I owe money to  Came to my house  Sent guys  Cleared all my furniture  And took my Corvair convertible  Just took  Corvair  Corvair  Corvair  Corvair convertible  That's like risky business  I came over  And just took all the shit  Yeah I had to give up  A nice chase lounge  Or whatever  Chase lounge  You're the best  I love it 
[02:00:00]  Corvair convertible  Monza  Which is right now  If I still had it  Yeah  You know  I could go to those  Antique shows  I'd be able to hang  Pawn it or sell it  Huh  Oh it'd have been gone by now  You know  Speaking of pawning  I don't know if we have the story  I guess they found a baseball card collection  In an attic  Do we have that story  And how much are they saying  They said only 500,000  That's bullshit  The collection's worth a half million  I think they said either  Half a million  And they got a Honus Wagner  Honus Wagner  I'm starting to think  There's a lot of those 
[02:00:30]  A lot of those Honus Wagner  Honus Wagner cards  Supposedly there were only  Like two or three  Now I think we're up to a dozen or so  Yeah  There was only a certain amount  That came from the cigarette pack  The Lucky Strikes  Or whatever the pack was  There was only  Oh it was  Was it a cigarette pack card  Yeah  The Honus Wagner one  Oh wait a minute  You got that Travis  Travis knows all  I have it in my memory  It's not the Honus Wagner card  That you're thinking of  Oh  It's  They found this set  From like 1910  That nobody even knew existed  Honus Wagner is one of the cards 
[02:01:00]  And it's interesting  Because it is a  It's a tobacco card  Which you know  He was against  So  He was?  Yeah  Why?  He was against cigarettes?  Yeah that's why the card is so  Was it 1910?  That's why the card is worth so much money  Cigarettes are like medicine  No I know  I know the whole story  People love cigarettes  No making a bit out of it  Like how do you know in 1910  That cigarettes are bad for you  Cigarettes are bad  Come on  In the 60's they didn't know  Right  Wow  So they're estimating  That the value I think is around what  Three million?  For what?  The whole 
[02:01:30]  For the whole set  Yeah it says there's 700 cards  And all could be worth up to three million  Yeah but they really don't know  Well this isn't the one  That everyone knows  It's going to sit in my shop for a while  100 bucks  Yeah  Can you do 150?  135  And that's as high as I'm going to go  Well I was looking to get 7 million  But I walked out with 135  So  I'm going to get  To take my wife out to dinner  Here in Vegas  I love that dumb show  What an idiot  Oh that's not fucking produced 
[02:02:00]  That guy doesn't learn  All of a sudden he knows about a Civil War  Fucking shoelace  Let me tell you a little about this watch  He brings in his pal  That just happens to know about the Civil War  I have an expert that knows about this stuff  I like when it's like a guy goes  Yeah I want $4,000 for this watch  He goes  Not out of the question  But let me get an expert in here  So I can tell  Meanwhile he's thinking  There's no fucking way I'm paying four grand for this  I'll get the expert  He'll talk about it  And then I'll offer him like 700 bucks  American dollars? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah yeah  I'm talking  700 cash  Right now  Right now  Heroinatic  Well I  You know I could take 700  And then I go to  Play fucking crap  So I could build it up to  The price I wanted  Okay  Yeah I want to  Send my daughter to college  Yeah yeah  I love when they think  They're going to send their daughter to college  On my way to buy a meth pipe  Okay  Oh really  I love it  Did you see the one 
[02:03:00]  Seen them all my friend  This black dude  Walked in there  And he goes  Oh you're going to give me this  And they go no  And they  He went out to store  Oh that must have been  Hardcore pawn  Which is different  By the way  Oh yeah that was  That one was hard  Yeah that was with the father  Shit I hate that fucking show  Yeah I hadn't come across it  Well I'd seen it in the TV listings  I never turned it on though  And I finally turned it on  Just to see like how bad  The first 20 seconds of me watching this  Was a black gentleman  Trying to pawn like a subwoofer  And he wanted a price  That they didn't want to pay 
[02:03:30]  And then the mother  Dragged him out by his ear  Saying you don't talk to people like that  And I'm like oh god  Are you kidding me  It's so fake  The first thing I see from this show  Yeah yeah yeah  And then she jumped back  Onto the pancake box  That's not the part I remember  You know how big these pawn shows have gotten  Is there's one on ABC now  Is there?  Yeah  There's a  It's like a sports card collectible store  And it's on ABC's  I like the ones with only toys  It's called Kitty Pawn  Whoa start the car 
[02:04:00]  Did you see the game show now?  Welcome to Opie and Pun  Storage fucking units have a show  And I don't  Storage units have a show  And I don't  Storage units have a little more personality  Okay  Have they found a dead body in those storage units yet?  Their context is more relevant  I'm not sure  Have they found a dead body yet?  That would be a big deal  No that would be a good one though  Because they buy these things  They know what's in those fucking things  That's another 
[02:04:30]  There's one  Of course they do  Here's what happens with these reality shows  There's one that's pretty much based in truth  And then five more shows come out  That are completely fake and scripted and shit  Now the storage locker one  They have one that's kind of real  And then they got a bunch of them  Where it's just fake scripted shit  Because they  It's not true  They don't have the patience to wait around  Until they finally find the good shit  Right  That's why reality shows in general suck now  The worst one I've seen  Used to wait it out  An ad for Lizard Lick Towing  Which is one of these fucking tow shows  That are completely fake 
[02:05:00]  They go into a garage  It's locked  They get locked inside somehow  And a fire starts  And they're in there going  We gotta get out  We gotta get out  Meanwhile the guy's still fucking filming the episode  Inside the locked on fire garage  Instead of trying to get out  You think at that point you'd stop filming?  Maybe he would  I was in California  Yeah  When it happened  When the fire started  You knew that?  Yeah  See  These fucking  First of all  I know the prices of these things  That they get  Out of these things  And they go  Well this is worth 300 
[02:05:30]  Really?  It's worth 300?  It's a black and white television  Okay  Really?  It's a fucking Mr. Coffee pot  Well with this couch I could get  No you can't  Because no one's going to pay top dollar  For a used  Fucking jizz monger  Piece of shit  Fucking lice infested  Okay  No one's going to pay that  So it's all  You're right  It's all bullshit  I remember one episode  One of the guys  They opened up one of these huge lockers  And it was  It was office furniture  He's like  I ain't bidding on that  He's like office furniture  You can't get shit for office furniture 
[02:06:00]  And then two episodes later  Another thing  You know  Office furniture  That's still in the box  Oh it's office furniture  It's great  It's never been used  You can get $300  This is great stuff  I'm going to bid on this one  And it's constant  Here's what happens every time  They open it up  And it's like  Oh this looks like a lemon  Oh we're not going to make any money on this  And then before they go to commercial  It's like  Hey there's a box over there  Whoa  And then they go to commercial  Go to commercial  And they come back  And it's like  Oh there was a hole in the box  Yeah yeah  And it's nothing  Fucking assholes 
[02:06:30]  Three time in life  Civil war chess set pieces  Okay  And then they  They all have a friend  That works  Oh we're going to take this down  To the train store  Like there's one fucking train store  Left  In that area  We're in town  Always  You know what  We're going to take this down  To the  Dove Soap  Memorial Museum  Who's the curator here  I want to speak with him  But you know these guys  Get a hold of their friends  And like  All right today you're the expert  You're going to be the expert on this 
[02:07:00]  We're going to come to you  All right  It's like wait a minute  A month ago he was the gun expert  What the fuck is this about  You know that's going on  This is horse shit  I thought of pickers  When like one of the pickers  He goes  He goes  I know the perfect guy  I'm going to sell this to  I have a customer  He would love something like this  So basically break that down  All right  He's in his head  He's in some guy's backyard  He goes  I know a guy  Who'd pay me  Like five fucking times  What I could get  Yeah yeah yeah  I'm paying for this  And then he'll go  Well how much you want for that  Let me get 150  And he'll go  Ooh  How about 100  And then when  He's like  He's like  Dude I got a great deal  I got it from him for 100 
[02:07:30]  I'm going to sell this for 700 dollars  Yeah yeah  So it's like  You knew you were going to make  A fuck ton of money  And you were still being a scumbag  On the price  He's still fucking trying to  Jap on the price  Here's one show  I only watch a little of it  Maybe once or twice  Where they buy something  Then resell it for more money  Then buy something else  Yeah  So they start all on like Craigslist  It's a resell show  Yeah yeah  It's a turnover shit  It's a turnover  So they end  You know okay  I bought Tootsie Pop 
[02:08:00]  For three cents  Tootsie Pop  And I sold it for 50  It works its way up  And the guy's living in a fucking mansion  That's got to be produced  You cannot turn a lollipop  Into a mansion  Yeah they're amazing  It's fucking insane  I watch those goddamn shows though  And it's captivating  That fucking Pawn Stars  Is the best one though  The fucking old man  I would hate to go to the counter with him  He doesn't want to give for shit  You walk in  You think you're getting somebody else  An old man  An old man comes along  I'd just be like  Fuck man  I'm fucked  Where is the gold doubloon 
[02:08:30]  I don't know son  That dude  Gold doubloons aren't going for all that much  I'm hungry  Why'd you go and goddamn buy a hot air balloon  You really know when he's done  Like you know that that is the last price he's giving  And he doesn't even let the other guys do it  Because like sometimes Corey's there  And he's like  The guy goes  Yeah I want $400 for it  And Corey goes  And Corey's like thinking about what he wants to do  And the old man's like  I ain't getting no more than $50 
[02:09:00]  It's like let Corey fucking talk  And by the way no one calls Corey Big Hoss  I've never heard him called Big Hoss  They're doing good  There was a time that they would work in our backyard for free  I saw him buy an aeroplane  An aeroplane  An aeroplane  An aeroplane  I saw him buy an aeroplane  I didn't know you were a fan of the Red Hot Chili  Okay  Oh yeah  And I've been to a lot of porn stores in my life  I've never seen an aeroplane 
[02:09:30]  I've never seen an aeroplane  An aeroplane  An aeroplane  It's nice still  You know  You never saw  Yeah  Yeah they buy shit  That's like where are they putting that  There was one  Where they were going to buy this big fucking robot crate  Did you see that one?  I saw it  It's like one of those big things that they take to the auto shows  It looks like a big monster  Yeah  Breeds fire  Truckzilla  He wanted a million bucks for it  Yeah  Let me get my Truckzilla expert here  I got an expert on giant machines that look like dragons 
[02:10:00]  Yeah the guys normally call me down whenever they got a big truck question  A big truck question  Well this is indeed a big monster made out of a machine  Although the girl on Storage Wars is kind of hot  Right right  She's not like whoa but she's like  Yup  Yup  That guy  Yeah yeah  You know he's holding out for more money  Really?  Yeah they gotta like  I guess all these guys have contracts  They gotta re-sign all these characters  Ah  And he knows that people  He's hated so much  Which one is he?  Dave Hester  Oh 
[02:10:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  So that if he left  People might not be interested in the show anymore  Because people love to hate him  So he's trying to hold out for a pit  Wow  I hope they ditch him  And he  Is that the one with the glasses?  He's like the  He always has big trucks  And the black  Because he says he makes so much money  He doesn't need that fucking show  He's just like  That's Trump change  It is odd  Because like even Pawn Stars  You know those motherfuckers are making more money  Than they're paying them to do the goddamn show  But I guess they get a lot of publicity  That store apparently  You went there right?  Yeah  And it's packed  Yeah it's  I mean I went on a weird day 
[02:11:00]  So it wasn't like a line outside  But there was definitely  Not a lot of moving around indoors  Half of the space is now retail  For like Pawn Stars memorabilia  Chumlee t-shirts  Oh my god  Yeah you get a coin  You know you get like a  Sixty dollar coin  With the old man's face on it  You know shit like that  Wow  And these guys aren't there obviously  Because they're  You know they'd just be mobbed  So there's a  There's just a big cardboard cutout way in the back  So that's where you go and take your pictures  They just show up to film the show  And they're not  They don't work there anymore  I can only speak for the day that I was there 
[02:11:30]  The day I was there  Right right right  I've been there day off  I know a reality show in a beauty salon they had  Okay  None of them  They were all casted  The customers were casted  Jerseylicious  I didn't say any names  I'm not fucking ratting anything out  But they're all casted  Jerseylicious  I don't know the name exactly  I just know  Well that's the only reality show in a beauty salon  How did you know that so quickly?  Oh my god  I watched a couple episodes  I got excited over it  I might have watched a few  Did you guys see  I might have watched  There's a new game show style show 
[02:12:00]  Called Picked Off  Oh it started last night  Yeah  Oh is that the one with the  The American Pickers guys  And  I don't know if it's the Pickers guys  Really?  It's on history  Yeah I was kind of falling asleep  But it's like a game show  Where it's like these teams of pickers  They have a set amount of time to go and pick  With a  I guess with a  Budget  I'm not sure because it just debuted last night  And like you know  The whole goal is to see  What team is the better  The better team of picker  That could get like  Make more money after  Who makes the better decision  Who can identify the better deal 
[02:12:30]  Sort of a thing  Uh huh  Danny turned me on to Final Offer  Have you watched that yet?  Oh yeah yeah yeah  That's a great show  That's pretty cool  I've seen some people  Fuck off so bad  I'm so glad you guys  Because I mentioned it  Fucking like last week  Everybody's looking at me  Like an asshole  Explain Final Offer  It's fucking good  Explain it  I don't even know this one  Alright it's uh  People take their collections  Or they're valuable  And they bring them to these  Four collectors  And each guy  They might be art dealers  Or whatever  It's always the same four guys  So here's the catch  You go in  Uh  You present your item  And then now you have 
[02:13:00]  These four rooms  With four dealers  In these rooms  You can go in  Sequentially  You know you pick a guy  That you want to start with  He'll give you an offer  You can negotiate  If you decide to take his offer  That's it  You don't talk to the other guys  If you pass on his offer  You will not have the chance  To get it again  You say that's it  And you go hoping  That the next  The other three guys  One of those guys  Will have a better offer  Wow  And then at the end  Everybody gets together  And they say okay  Well who bought it  And what was the price  And then everybody's like  I would have paid  I would have paid an extra thousand  Or another guy  Yeah  But are they so fucking dumb  Are they purposely trying to fuck you too 
[02:13:30]  For the show  Well there are times  When some people don't know  What they have  There's times when other people  Like the collectors  Don't know what it is  That they're trying to buy exactly  That's all bullshit  Because they'll go into booth one  He'll say ten thousand  No no no  And then the producer  Goes to booth two in the air  Offer him four  Okay  It's like fucking  We'll try to make something  Okay so  They gotta make TV still  Yeah so  Coming up on 21  So  You know what 
[02:14:00]  It's let's make a deal  Yeah yeah  It's basically  The final offer  Brought to you by Genital  Did you see  Did you see the one  With the Marilyn Monroe dress  No  For five hundred thousand dollars  She passed it up  And no one offered her shit  After that  They're like  And they don't know  What offer they gave  So they're like  How about thirty thousand dollars  And she's like  She just passed up  Half a million  But does she have to sell it  At that point  No no no  She can choose not to sell it  Did you see the season finale  With that chick who had  Like this 
[02:14:30]  It's not a ruby  It was like  Some ring  I miss sapphire  I didn't see that one  It might have been a sapphire  But it was like  It was the perfect grade  Like everybody knew  That she had something  That was worth like  Yeah  Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars  And she knew it too  She took two hundred grand  One of the guys  Was going to offer like four hundred  How do you know that  Because after you sell it  That's the show  That's the show  That's the show  You know  After you sell it  They all go back into the room  And say okay  Here's what I got for it  And if somebody  If you didn't get to present 
[02:15:00]  The item to somebody  They would have said  Well I would have paid this much  Or like yeah  I wouldn't have paid that much  Think they're lying  Yeah  You don't trust anyone rich  Yeah  Yeah  That girl  Yeah  That chick with the Monroe dress  Was great though  Because she got it off of eBay  For like thirty grand  Yeah  And she turned down  Half a mil  Because she wanted a whole mil  Yeah  And then never  Can you imagine  Getting something off of eBay  And then a legitimate  Five hundred thousand dollar offer  Yeah but you know what  That showcased  For thirty thousand  That showcased  I guarantee she sold it 
[02:15:30]  For more money somewhere else  You think  Yeah it was seen on TV  And it was  Yeah you know  Who the fuck  Some fruit  You know what else is cool too  Hollywood Treasures  Hollywood Treasures  I haven't seen that one  Hollywood Treasures  Hollywood Treasures  On sci-fi  It's about  You know profiles in history  That big auction  Oh yeah  Hollywood auction house  They have their own  They have their own show  Ooh  Yeah and it's really interesting  Because this is like  High end  Like  Hollywood memorabilia stuff  Hollywood memorabilia  Fucking great  Like if you're into  Like weird

[02:16:30]  Right  Exactly  They had a vacuum  But they were passing it off  As Christopher Reeves  Wait  I don't even  Explain  Because he's on wheels  And  Had his rest parade  Sold for ninety five thousand  Holy shit  Ninety five thousand  Red October  That's pretty fucking cool though  It's huge  And the guy didn't want to take it  Because he's like  It's big  Who's going to buy it  Whoever's going to buy it  Has to put it somewhere  And he couldn't imagine  It's going to be in my shop  A long time  It's going to take up room 
[02:17:00]  And the guy that  The guy that owned this  Who gave it to Profile  Who consigned it to Profile  To sell  Also had the Forrest Gump  Bench  Yeah  Wow  Yeah he's got a lot of shit  Why is that worth big money?  Oh yeah  The bench from Forrest Gump  If this is the actual bench  The price can go through the roof  Really?  Yeah man  Yeah  To collectors  That's huge  Is there a Back to the Future  Auction happening or something?

No I was coke  Oh okay  Oh  That was before crack  I didn't go to concerts  When I did crack  Who has time for concerts?  What's time for anything but crack?  Like crack  Did I? 
[02:33:00]  I ever tell the story  When me and my buddy Buzz  Buzzy were fucked up on cocaine  And we went to a James Taylor show  Oh wow  And we were in the front row  Good choice of fucking artists  That's why it's funny  That's the thing  We were making a complete  Complete asses of ourselves  Because we were wired  And everyone's just chilling  Because he's just singing  His tiny little mellow song  Singing his little mellow song  But to us  We were at like a Metallica show  Did I ever tell this story?  And we got kicked out?  You got kicked out of a concert? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah because we were  Completely over the top  Yeah  I've seen  But I remember  I remember the day  To us  We thought we were  Acting appropriately  Why don't you look out?  And he's just like  Oh my gosh  Doing fire and rain  And we're thinking  It's Enter Sandman  In our heads  You gotta help me  Take a stand  I've seen fire  And I've seen rain  Yeah motherfucker  Sing it you fuck  That's pretty much 
[02:34:00]  What was happening  I've seen longer days  That I thought would never  Whoa  Mother fucker  Did I ever tell this story  On the air?  We were like an hour late  And we thought  That was normal  And then we thought  Sing it you mother fucker  We took our seats  We were singing  A little too loud  We were doing the sing-alongs  When no one else  Was singing along  Oh man  Embarrassing  And I believe  It got to a point  Where James Taylor  Completely noticed us 
[02:34:30]  And we got kicked out  You gotta help me  Make a stand  Woo!  Yeah motherfucker!  Love this fuck!  We were so zooted  Zooted  We were fucked up  And really  Coke will fucking do shit to you  We went to see the New York Dolls  We were tripping our brains out  It was Halloween night  At the Waldorf Astoria  And everybody's fucking trinched  It's all gay  The New York Dolls  Had a big gay following 
[02:35:00]  Certainly  Hence why you were there  The best costumes  And we're all fucking  Fucked up on blotter acid  Yeah  I told  And we're sitting on a table  And the lead singer  Had a gun that shot light  With a snare drum  It was like a machine gun  Shooting light  And we're tripping  Oh I'll freak out  And we're fucking freaking out  Then we go outside  To look for our car  His mother's  We go to a cop  We go  Where's our car?  And he goes  Oh it was probably  Impounded  But we thought he meant  Compounded into a little square 
[02:35:30]  Because we were tripping  Big Joe's fucking car in tow  And we go  Your mother's car  Is a paperweight  No one that'll be missed  Are you kidding?  That's a great  Fuck it  Little cube  You were fucked up  We were so fucking  And we're walking around  All depressed  And we see the car  And there was like  Fireworks  And Jesus  And everything  Compacted  Impounded 
[02:36:00]  Compounded  Compacted  You are fucked up  Rich Vos  James Taylor and Coke  Yeah  Yep  Sounds fun  I was the good old days  Those were great concerts  Back then  Yep  Were they?  We really thought  We were seeing  Some fucking  Loud over the top thing  Anyway  Here's Robert Blake  Yeah let's hear Robert Blake  On the murder of his  I think it was  His wife at the time  Bonnie  Or is it now  Something you've blocked  Out of your head  No I remember it quite well 
[02:36:30]  You went and had dinner  At this restaurant  Where are you going?  Oh  I'm interested  In what happened  No you're not interested  In a guy  What are you doing?  What the hell are you doing?  Let me help you  Let me take this out of my ear  There's no one talking to me  Okay  You haven't got to worry  There is nobody talking to me  These are my questions for you  Which are based in my view  Perfectly legitimately  Now you want to know  What happened that night?  I'm curious yeah  No you're not curious  I am because you were quitted  I thought you said  You researched all this  So you know what happened that night 
[02:37:00]  I know  I know the facts of the night  I'm curious about  Tell me about the facts of the night  You take your wife for dinner  You take your wife for dinner  To a restaurant  Go ahead  Your wife goes to the car  You go back to retrieve  As you say  Your gun  Which is in the restaurant  And when you return  Your wife has been shot dead  When they test the gun  That you go and retrieve  That is not the same gun  That killed her  Am I right so far?  So far  Right  So I'm factually correct  I have no agenda here  At all 
[02:37:30]  You clearly think I do  But I don't  It sounds boring as hell  But go ahead  I don't think it's boring  Your wife got murdered  No but your questions  Are boring  I mean even what you just said  Are you sure the people at Tibet  Give a f*** about any of this?  What?  What was that part?  In bed  Oh people that are in bed  Like they're watching in bed  Oh  He doesn't understand  It is pretty compelling  To hear a guy that you  Think might have murdered  Or at least had his wife murdered  Kind of a thing  Talk about the murder 
[02:38:00]  It is compelling  But in all fairness  To Robert Blake  Hasn't this been talked about  A million times?  Why is it being brought up now?  But why is he doing  Why is he out right now?  What's he doing?  He wrote a book  He wrote a book  Oh so he's rarely out  So it would be  In line to ask him about this?  Well yeah  It's in the book  Come on  It's in the book  Oh and it's in the book  It's his life  Alright  You want to ask him about  When he was little Mickey  On the Little Rascals  Right  79 years old by the way  And it looks like he could still 
[02:38:30]  Beat the shit out of a lot of people  79?  That's what I just looked up  79 for Robert Blake  1933 right?  67 plus 12  That's 79 in my mind  1933?  Yeah he was one of the  79  Later on during the  Shitty Little Rascals  He was in that one  Right  Where Spanky was all fat  Fat Spanky  And fucking Darla  Started getting giant tits on her  Fuck we was allowed to sit  On the front of the bus  Well not really  Not quite  Hal Roach put fucking  He knew how to put them 
[02:39:00]  In their place  Jesus  That guy was a fucking  Racist prick  Who was Hal Roach?  Hal Roach  Yeah the fucking guy  That put all that shit together  You don't remember  The sweat on the wall?  When Stymie fucking  Was sweating  Working over the stove  And he went to take the sweat  He wiped his forehead  And flung his hand  To fling the sweat off  And it was brown  All along  Brown spots on the wall  Black fucking shit  Where his sweat would have been black  Because he was a black guy  How he had fucking Spanky  And Stymie and shit 
[02:39:30]  Running past fire  That was flying out  And it was no CGI back then  They lit fires  There was real fire  And had children run through it  Do you remember  When the 1910 Fruit Gum Company  Fruit Gum Company  Fruit Gum Company  Played in the radio station  And the guy's  Hair popped out  That wasn't the 1910 Fruit Gum Company  Who were they?  It was the International Silver String Submarine Band  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  You're right  And they played the  Man on the Flying Trapeze  And then the guy's head 
[02:40:00]  Yeah  And the engineer  His hair would pop out  That was me  You look  Back in the 80s  Exactly  Actually, you look really good  Have you not drank it for a day?  Thank you  For a day  Actually, well  Nah, technically  No  You've got a good glow  I'm tan  I fucking  I honestly have not been  Partaking in as much booze  As I have been  Not for any reason 
[02:40:30]  But just  I just  I don't feel like  I'm as  For some reason  I'm just not as  Into getting hammered  As much as I  She can't get into bars  No  Oh jeez  Who are you kidding?  You're all pipped today, aren't you?  Oh shit  Yeah, that was  That's Robert Blake right there  We're watching a little clip  From our gang 
[02:41:00]  The guy  Kid in the middle  The little kid in the middle  The shortest one  Oh god  Alfalfa  Alfalfa wind up getting  Yeah, that's the kid on the left  Is Robert Blake  That's Robert Blake  Oh  Froggy  Yeah, he's on the right  That's Robert Blake  He's not in  These are the later ones  That really sucked  Look at Alfalfa  Yeah, he looks  A little too old  For his bow tie  Yeah  And they were always 
[02:41:30]  Making him sing  I'm a crooner  These were terrible  Look at Fat Spanky  Buckwheat  You know they kept him fat too, right?  Oh yeah  Spanky was hilarious  In the early ones  When he was a kid  With a monkey  Fucking  Wreaking havoc  In the orphanage  Alright, let's get back  To Robert Blake  Terrible  Because we're gonna run out of show  And then we're not gonna get  To the Bonnie blowjob thing  For the podcast  Oh shit  This Robert Blake shit 
[02:42:00]  Is really good  I think you're here  Because you've written  A book about your life  Yeah  And I would argue  There's a lot more to my life  I'm sure  Than that night  But there's probably  Beretta  Yeah, but you know what  If you're part of  A whole murder thing  I'm sorry  But people kind of  Want to hear about that  You can be as frustrated  As you want  But that's gotta  Come up every time  All of a sudden  Nobody gives a fuck  About the parrot  No  And no one really  No one really wants  To talk to OJ  About his Heisman  Exactly  It's pretty much  Sucks to be you  But unfortunately  You know  This is the highlight  Of your life  I'm sure 
[02:42:30]  Than that night  But there's probably  Nothing more significant  In your life  Than  Really?  Than the murder  Of your wife?  I didn't murder my wife  It may be significant  To you  I didn't say you did  But it isn't to me  I said  You said  There's nothing more significant  Than the murder  Of your wife  Personally  It's not the most  Significant thing  In my life  What is the most  Significant thing  In my life  Is when I was  Two years old  And I found an audience  The next most 
[02:43:00]  Significant thing  Is when I went to  MGM as an extra  And three years later  I starred  In my first film  You know  I don't know  America just was  Going to war  It was the worst time  In the world  For America  But there's nothing  More significant  Than a little boy  With no parents  No friends  Nothing  Walking into MGM  And three years later  Starring  In his first film  You know how significant  That is?  No  Because you've never  Lived my life  I think 
[02:43:30]  The murder thing  Really kind of  Puts all that other stuff  It's still above  All that stuff  Kind of in the backseat  A little bit  Oh wow  Pears asked Robert Blake  If he's sane  Oh no  This ain't gonna  Play out well  Oh you peers  Do you think  You're sane  I'm what?  Do you think you're sane?  Do you think you have  Your full sanity?  Or has what's happened  To you  Sent you slightly mad?  What do you think?  Well I'll tell you  I think I was born 
[02:44:00]  The truth is  I think I'm sort of a  A mutation  Or a subspecies  I think if I was born  10,000 years ago  I would have taken  Two or three people  Gone off  And started another tribe  How much do you  Blame your parents?  I don't blame anybody  I  That book  Is about God  What?  God kept me alive  In a womb  When my mother  Tried to abort me  With coat hangers  Twice  Jesus  God kept me alive  For the first two years  Of my life 
[02:44:30]  When nobody gave a  S**t  Whether I lived or died  God showed me  Where that sidewalk was  And I started dancing  When I got out here  I was five years old  I stood in front of MGM  And I said  I can do this  And I walked in there  Three years later  I starred in my first film  Wait  He's just a five year old  Going out to Hollywood?  He's five  He's fucking walking  Around the streets  Hey motherfucker  The way he said  Eight  Now eight  He was in his first film  I thought it was three  I don't know  Was he in an orphanage  Out there in Hollywood?  I would assume  And they just let him out  As a five year old 
[02:45:00]  And he went to MGM?  The foundlings  Took me in  The foundlings  With a coat hanger  Stuck out of his leg  Yeah  Old coat hanger head  How does he know his mom?  He's bobbing and weaving  In that womb  Oh man  Whoa  Almost got me  I don't remember  When I was four  More or less  When I was in a womb  Uh oh  Coat hanger  When she tried to  Bort me twice  All right  Who pulled a rod  On the heat?  Berenna  Oh oh oh oh 
[02:45:30]  Oh oh oh  I think I'm a mutation  That's wonderful  Don't do the crime  If you can't  Do the time  Don't do it  Remember that shit?  Sort of  I sort of know it  Yeah  Robert thinks  Piers is calling him  A liar  Yeah  You want to get  To the truth  If you can  Does that handle  The truth to you?  I don't know  Are you? 
[02:46:00]  Commercial  What do you think?  I don't know  I don't know  I think we're going to  Get to some questions  Where  Well tell me where I'm lying  Because if you don't know  I'm telling you the truth  Then you must have  A little scratch  In the back of your head  About where I'm lying  Now tell me  Tell me where I'm lying  I'm not saying you're lying  But you're saying  You don't know  If I'm telling the truth  What the hell is the difference?  I'm saying  I've met you for what  20 minutes?  I don't care about that  You put me on the stand  I'm telling the truth  And you say  You're scratching the head  Why are you being so defensive?  Because you just insulted me 
[02:46:30]  I didn't insult you  Yes you did  Nobody tells me I'm a liar  I didn't call you a liar  You said I might not  Be telling the truth  What the hell is the difference?  I said I'm going to ask you  I don't want to take this  Anyplace special  All I want  Okay let me say it this way  My skin is a little bit thin  Sure  Which is why I stay away  From people mostly  I've never allowed anybody  To ask me the questions  That you're asking  I allowed you to do that  Because I trust you 
[02:47:00]  And I would have assumed  That you  And that guy in your ear  Would trust me  And if you don't  Then we better start talking  About the little rascals  That's funny  This is great for peers  And for fucking Robert Blake  He'll sell some books  Based on this  Because you want to read  About a fucking mental patient  Like this  Well Roland came to me  This morning and said  Do you want Robert Blake?  Yes  You think that could happen?  If he made that happen  That would be huge  That would be awesome  I'll talk to little rascals with him 
[02:47:30]  And I'll ask him  If he's lying to me  What do you think  This is all about?  That he got away with murder  And he just doesn't want to  Deal with it?  He's always been  A nutty fucking guy  Even during Beretta  You'd listen to interviews  With people that worked with him  And say he was fucking crazy  Wasn't this like  Your second or third wife too?  Was it?  It was sort of like  A fan or something  I remember  I don't know  That he ended up marrying  We haven't thought about this  In years  But what happened that day?  Did they ever arrest anyone  For that murder?  No 
[02:48:00]  OJ  You think it was a hit?  OJ  It had to be  Come on  The guy fucking walks inside  To get his gun  I heard he was miserable  Or something  There was something going on  Between those two  Yeah but if it was a hit  Why would he do it  When he was anywhere near her?  You know he's not  I mean  To throw him off the scent  It's fucking perfect  Not everyone gets that  Perfect alibi  Where they go to  Fucking California  While their condo's burning down  He knows  He knows  That they're going to be  At a certain place  At a certain time 
[02:48:30]  Because he's with her  He knows  He's just got to  Take her out  Right  Leave his gun inside  Right  Say oh I gotta get my gun  And everyone sees him  Go back to the restaurant  To get the gun  So he can't  He definitely didn't shoot her  Because he's  His gun is inside  Okay but  Okay if you're going to be involved  In something like this  Why even carry a gun  Why wouldn't it be something  You know what I mean  Why even bring a gun into the pit  Oh I left my gun  Because he always carries  Why would he do something different  You don't do anything different  You do the same shit  You would do on any other day  That's the mistake you made 
[02:49:00]  When flying to California  Listen who takes  Your gun out to  In a restaurant  When they're eating  That's true  Like why would you do that  Unless he's on the shitter  You know if you go into the shitter  You gotta pop your gun out  And pop it up on a fucking  You know toilet paper holder  Or something like that  Okay so here's the deal  Or maybe out of respect  There's a type of restaurant  Where you kind of check your guns  You know what I mean  Maybe it's one of those  Type of joints  Popeyes  Old west  I don't know  Popeyes  But maybe that's something you do  I don't know  I don't know  The way he told it  In a clip that I didn't pull  For you guys  Is that you know 
[02:49:30]  His wife was a con artist  And there was a lot of  A lot of people  You know  Wanted her dead  Or wanted something bad  To happen  But you know  Nobody could ever find her  And he goes  Well you know  And then she marries Robert Blake  Well where does Robert Blake live  And they just did it that way  You're not taking a big shit  No Eric's taking a big shit  But with that said  She ended up conning Robert Blake  Into her life  Yes  And then Robert Blake goes  Holy fuck I've been conned  How the hell am I getting out of this thing  I've been conned  I'm not saying he didn't  He didn't have anything to do with it 
[02:50:00]  I'm saying that  No I know  That was his  His explanation in a clip  That I didn't pull  Because it was like whatever  Liar liar  Pants on fire Robert Blake  That's what I say  Being called out for  Saying check your gun  I don't know  Well  I don't know  Maybe there's a place like that  No there's no check your gun  But there are places  That don't allow guns  Right  You know  So alright  If they don't allow a gun  And you have a gun  Then what happens  You gotta find somewhere  To put your gun  Or can you check your gun  I don't think you can  Check your gun  I think there's a liability problem 
[02:50:30]  You can check your guns  At like courthouses  And things like that  And precincts  But I don't think  A private establishment  Is gonna hook up a place  Where you can check your gun  The liability issues  Are astounding  At that point  I'm officially a dummy  No  Just you know  There's certain things  People know about  I'm officially a dummy  So then why did  Alright so where was the gun then  He left it at his  He might have left it  Either at the table  Which is ridiculous  But you're  Was it at the table  Well that's what it sounds like  He's saying  Because they were leaving  But that's crazy 
[02:51:00]  And then he said  Oh I gotta go get my gun  So  That's why it's suspicious  And it's a responsible gun owner  Okay  You're not  You're not leaving your gun anywhere  No never  How would you leave your gun  In a restaurant  You're always conscious  Of where the fuck it is  At all times  So where was the gun  In the restaurant  That had to come out  Might have been in the court  If it was in the  And then what are the odds  That nobody else went in there  In the shitter  After him  Might have been  I think it was late  I don't know  Believe me  I think the guy was involved  Believe me  She was in the car too  When she got shot 
[02:51:30]  Right  Wasn't she  I think so yeah  No whether he was involved  Or not  The fact remains  He definitely left his gun  In the restaurant  Yeah he did  And that's all I'm talking about  Right now  Hence my stupid  Check the gun theory  Because it sounds ridiculous  Because I know  Ant's  You know  A responsible gun owner  And this shit  Just doesn't happen  You don't fucking  Take your gun out  In a restaurant  How about it fell out  Onto the floor  He realized it was gone  Went in to get it  But what did they say  In the court case  It had to come out  It had to  Like did he leave it  In the shitter  Did he leave it  In like some kind  Of a booth 
[02:52:00]  In the restaurant  Where was his gun  When he went in  To get it  That's the question  We need to know  Right now  Do some research  Fucking pal talk people  Don't just stare at me  Help us out  Tweet me  I don't give a fuck  Jesus Christ  Anything  You lazy fuckers  I go to that restaurant a lot  They wouldn't care about  Walking in with a gun  Okay that's  Some places do  Some places don't  Obviously we're moving past  To check the gun theory  Which was stupid on my part 
[02:52:30]  I get it  But I want to know  The real answer  There are places though  New York's  Kind of weird  There's almost a good part  Of New York  Being so much  Of a pain in the ass  To carry a concealed weapon  Because a lot of these  Open states  That are very lenient  Is California open state  I don't even know  No not really  California's kind of  A pain in the ass  But like let's say Texas  Very easy to get a gun  In Texas  Arizona  Stuff like that  A lot of these establishments  Put up signs that say  No guns on premises  Okay  And you're not allowed  To go in there with your gun  Because everyone has a gun 
[02:53:00]  In New York  You never see those signs  Because most of the people  Don't have guns  And they don't have to  Put those signs up  Because for the most part  No one's going to have a gun  When they walk in these places  Unless they're you know  Bad guys  Gotcha  So you almost work  It almost works out better  That you can go into more places  With your gun  In a tougher state  To get a gun in  See now someone  Kyle in Indiana  Says he checked his gun  With his coat  And I really want to  Go to his phone call  But I think  It's more abuse for me  Yes  I think it's going to be  A joke  Of course  All right let's hear 
[02:53:30]  Kyle  Ah you don't know  All right  Apparently he left it  In the booth  Like that they were sitting in  He left it in the  Okay a booth  Now that's different  I pictured some chairs  Around a table  But if it's a booth  It could have like  He maybe didn't want  To sit down  Because sometimes  A holster's uncomfortable  Right  So he might have  Taken it out  And put it next to him  Here's where it's  Here's where it's weird  All right  After they left  Blake returned to the restaurant  To retrieve his handgun  Which he had left  In the restaurant booth 
[02:54:00]  He asked for water  And after drinking  Two glasses  He left again  That ought to be long  After hearing bang bang  Yeah yeah  He went outside  After drinking two glasses  Of water  Right before he's  On his way home  Two glasses of water  Well see here's the deal  All right  If there's a hit set up  He's got to stall  In the restaurant  He's got to leave  The fucking scene  Right  Because he doesn't want  You know  By accident  See shit  And then have to  Oh have to  Go through a lie detector test  Or whatever the fuck  So he's got to get  He's got to get himself  Back in the restaurant  How do you do that 
[02:54:30]  In California  Because you know  You're not going to  Forget a code or something  Because it's warm  And he can't forget  The car keys  Because she had to  Let her in  Right  Right  So it's got to be  Something on your person  Wallet  Could be a wallet  Maybe he went with  The credit card thing  But at the last second  They're like  Oh here's your credit card  Mr. Blake  God damn it  Now I've got to  Ditch my gun  Now I've got to  Get up off this seat  And leave my gun behind  Because he's got to  Get back in the restaurant  So they can do  What they're doing  And then he comes back out  And he's got the perfect alibi  Everyone saw that  He went back into the restaurant  Yeah  Just saying 
[02:55:00]  Yeah  And that  And restaurant water  You're not going to  Just have one cup  Because it's so good  Oh you've got to have two  You've got to have two  Why would you sit there  And have two glasses of water  Because you know  You don't want to walk out  While she's being shot  That's why  Thank you  That's why I'm bringing it up  Come on  That's just poor planning  Have you ever left  Your girl in the car  To have two glasses of water  Two glasses of water  Why not just go to the bathroom  Right  Yeah  You might slam one  You might slam one  You're like  You know what 
[02:55:30]  I need a glass of water  But I can do this  In a couple seconds  But you get another one  You get dry mouth  From nerves  Because his wife  Is being shot outside  And he's hoping  No one is  No one is suspicious  That he's sitting there  Drinking his water  Yeah  You know  Takes him time  To open his crystal light  Pour it in  Yeah  Are we allowed to say  We think he killed his wife  We could say  What we think  You could have an opinion  That's just our opinion  That's my opinion  My opinion is  He knew something  Yeah  He knew like  He didn't do it  I'll absolutely say 
[02:56:00]  He didn't do it physically  But I believe  He knew the person  That did it  And was probably  Behind the reason  Yeah  That's my opinion  I could say that  Fuck it  Fuck out  Well here's the last clip  From Piers Morgan  Robert Blake  When I did all that  Facebook stuff  And then I went in the closet  And I found two boxes  Of pictures  That I didn't know exist  They were full of  Rack  And I pulled all these  Pictures out  And I said  That's all me  And I said  What do I do with this  Somebody said  Write a book  And I couldn't write a book 
[02:56:30]  Because I'm not going  To write six books  I'm only going to write  One book  How do I put  75 years  In one book  Well you do it  The way you just saw  There's four or five  Little chapters  About the rascals  There's chapters  About those  Rotten bastard cops  That  Rip my guts out  And left me  Beside the road  To die  I'll get to you  Son of the bitches  Later  But don't think  You're going to  Get off the hook  Oh shit  I was supposed  To die in that cell  Wasn't I 
[02:57:00]  You bastards  Well I didn't die  And you didn't  Get your book  Deal  Mothers  I wrote a book  About you  So you'll have  To go out  And rip some other  Celebrity till he's dead  Then you can write  A book about him  I'm sorry  I'm back  That's how  So the book  Became all of my life  Wow  The whole time  He's saying that  By the way  He's looking at the camera  And pointing  Right  Like he's talking  To the cops  Hulk Hogan  I'm coming for you  Oh boy  His show was based  On that  On  What's his name 
[02:57:30]  Tong  Or the guy  That used to  Yes  I know the guy  Don't look for help  Ex cop  Yeah yeah  You got it  What Beretta  Yeah it was  Based on this guy  Which guy  I thought his name  Was Tong  Or no  Superco  Was  Tong  Was  Are you trying to say  Tom or is it  Really Tong  I don't know  The guy's name  But I'm saying  His show was based  On that guy  What guy  The fucking guy  In New York  Or California  I don't know  I don't know 
[02:58:00]  I've never heard of this  Yeah his show  Is based on  Do you know  Who I'm talking about  I do  No you don't  I just don't  Want to help you  Okay  Hmm  It is a guy  Is there a guy  Yep  Yeah  All those shows  Back then  Were based on  Something  I guess  He was a  Motivational speaker  That was an ex cop  Beretta  That  What was his real name  Got sober  Beretta  Wait a minute  How long  Did Beretta run  Those shows  Well no  They caught him  Right away 
[02:58:30]  Alright  Those shows  Didn't run that long  Right  Usually  Um  I don't know  Well fucking  You know what  First of all  Robert Blake's wife  Was crazy  75 to 78  Yeah there you go  Three years  Four years  Robert Blake's wife  Was a crazy stalker  Before they got married  I think she was married  A whole bunch of times  Yeah  Kooky  And then he got  Had and went  Holy fuck  This  She's not gonna get  The best of me  You probably didn't know  Oh Toma 
[02:59:00]  Yes  All right  The show is a milder  Version of the  Successful  73-74 ABC series  Toma  Starring  Tony  Musante  As a chameleon  Like real life  New Jersey police officer  David Toma  I remember Toma  That show  I didn't like watching  Because the name of it  Just sounded like  Toomer  Toma  You remember that though  Yeah  I kind of remember that  I was a little  Tater tot  There was a real guy though  Was there  Yeah  I didn't know  It was based on like  Toma 
[02:59:30]  Yeah  Yeah  See I was close  What'd I say  Tom  Listen  You're stalling  So you do a podcast  With your wife  Are we done with Robert Blake  I guess  Yeah  That's some crazy shit  He is crazy  He's nuts  Well I'm not a big fan  Of Pierce Morgan either  We had him on  He was kind of cool  But  Yeah but when he used to  I'm not digging this show  America's Got Talent  He would trash the comedians  Going that's not funny  Go fuck yourself  You know what  What do you know  What funny is  You know he always  Trashed comics  On America's Got Talent  If he said you were funny  You'd be like  Oh my god 
[03:00:00]  This guy knows funny  No first of all  If he said I'm not funny  I'd go  Thank you  Because you're not  My target audience  You stuffy  Fucking uptight  Dude  Wow  Alright  I'm down  You told him  No I didn't tell him  But well he's not on the  I can't watch America's Got Talent  No  I don't watch it  But I used to  I saw on TV  I used to watch it  I just can't watch it  It's kind of weird  It's a weird show  It's dull  It's the gong show really  It's what it is  It is the gong show  It's an updated version  Of the gong show  I don't know why 
[03:00:30]  You  Go ahead nothing  What  Go ahead nothing  What  Nothing I know  I'll say it later  What  What are you going to play  The podcast  What happened  A little bit  Yeah but what were you going to say later  Oh go ahead  I'll tell you  I can't do it now  It'll ruin it  Ruin what  Too late  Whatever  Let's go  Let's go  Oh shit  Does it have something  In America's Got Talent  You run the show  With our podcast  Oh  No I used to like the show  But they fucked up with the judges 
[03:01:00]  Oh  Because Piers Morgan was the prick  And then they replaced him with  Howard who was supposed to be the prick  But now he's  Like he's too nice  So it fucked up the whole  Like judging thing  And it makes it unwatchable  If Howard  I don't  Do you understand what I'm saying  Yes  There's no  There's no controversy  There's no conflict  No because  I thought he was going to be the mean guy  How the judge shows work  And you know  You could say I'm jealous 
[03:01:30]  And all that  Whatever  But this is  This is the real thing here  You get the one nice person  That's Sharon Osbourne  She's motherly  She nurtures them  She kind of knows  How to tell them the bad news  In a way that  Kind of  You know  It's cool  Then you get the comic  Who is ready with the jokes  And then you get the guy  Who's kind of the prickly guy  That's how those shows work  And I think they were expecting  Howard to be the prickly guy  But Howard decided  Oh no  I need to show America  That I'm actually a nice guy now  So it's weird to me 
[03:02:00]  He's not been a dick to anybody  Not really  Not really  He's the one that gets up  And goes on the stage  I've seen a couple  Yes  But I haven't watched in weeks  And he's the one that goes on stage  And comforts them  And hugs them and stuff  It's like  No  You were hired to be Piers Morgan  Or Simon Cowell  He's changing his  But he decided on the  On the fly  That I'm going to show America  That I'm actually a nice guy  Because the rumor has been  Over the years  That he actually is a nice guy  When he's not doing his radio show  Yeah but the difference  Between Simon Cowell  And Piers Morgan 
[03:02:30]  Is Simon Cowell  Really does know music  And he did give good advice  Piers Morgan  Just was trying to be a dick  To be a dick  To be a watered down  Simon Cowell  And he doesn't get comedy  So that's why  You had a problem with him  Well you don't say  Someone's not funny  You know who they're praising  What's his name  Tom Carter  He's an okay comic  Yeah he's doing okay  You're giving a thumbs down  No I'm not  I like Tom  What are you worried about  He's a friend of mine  Let's keep it real  I'm talking about Howard  And keeping it real  You don't like Tom Carter  No no no  Don't say that 
[03:03:00]  I did not  I went like that  Because it was something  On my thumb  You jackass  These comics are hilarious  What's wrong with you  Why don't you say it  Because I like Tom  I don't want to have a fake conversation  If you don't like him  If you don't think he's a great comic  Say it  Don't say he's okay  And give me a thumbs down  And don't expect me to call you out on that  I didn't do that  You snitch  I didn't do that  You fucking  Listen this is what I did  But I have to be a snitch  Because it's not  Then we're not having a real conversation about it  First of all  You said he's okay  And then you give me the thumbs down  No no no  You don't think he deserves the attention he's getting 
[03:03:30]  No you're wrong  Here's what I think  He's a solid road comic  But I don't think he's special either  No no  And that's the point  They're praising him like he's the best comic in America  What it is  Here's what it is  First with Tom  I like him  I like his wife  He's been around for a long time  Forever  For a long time  And I have nothing against the guy  And I like seeing him get a fucking break  The dude has been busting his ass  Okay  He's not  Listen he's not Louis C.K.  He's not fucking  He's not DiPaolo 
[03:04:00]  He's not our type of comedy  Okay  But what he does  He does it well  Okay that's all  He does  Not saying  I like what he does  But what he does  He does well  Right  So I'm not saying he's bad  On a 1 to 10 scale  He's a 10 for what he does  He's not our brand of humor  He's not Norton  He's not Bobby  He's not Billy  Okay  So America eats that shit up  Because one  He's doing it in 90 seconds  Right  Okay  Two  He's clean 
[03:04:30]  Okay  Listen  I would never do that  Okay  No one you know  That comes in here  Would do that  No offense to Tom Cotter  But they're praising him  On America's Got Talent  As this amazing comic  And there's a million guys  That are better than him  And a million guys  That would love that attention  On America's Got Talent  That's all I'm trying to say  Of course  Of course  But they're not being honest  With that shit  And there's a million people  On every show  That's better than the winner  Okay  He's what they got  He fits the mold  He's white 
[03:05:00]  He's clean cut  He wears a suit  It's easy  It's non-offendable  Okay  So that's what they love  That's what the networks say  He's not a bad fucking dude  You know  Whatever  Yeah  I think  He seems like  He's a nice guy  And all that  My point is  He's not that talented  To get all that attention  And you get a lot of exposure  From that show obviously  Even though the ratings  Are way down  Name one of the comics  That come in here  That could do that show  Within a minute  They'd be like 
[03:05:30]  Beep beep  Now the commercial  I mean  We choose to go with  The edgier comics  In general  Yeah  And comics that are more real  That's why you got rid  Of Babiglia  You know  You like comics  What's wrong with you  I like Mike  You don't like Mike  I like Mike  And I'm not giving the thumbs down  This is a commercial  I do like the guy  Huh  I like him  No he's dysfunctional  He's got good dysfunction  I like Mike Brabiglia  He's got dysfunction 
[03:06:00]  I liked him  You know  We're big fans of Ralphie Mae too  I hope  I went out to dinner  Right here  I went out to dinner  Yeah  I went out to dinner  With Ralphie  A couple weeks ago  Right  Yeah how was it  He took us to  No-B  No-B  No-B  No-B  No-B  No-B  No there was  We went to  No-B-1 Kenobi's  But knowing Rich  How he has to get  A fucking deal  And everything  There's probably  A rip-off joint  Called  No-B  No he paid 
[03:06:30]  It was No-B  It's just as good  Where the sushi's  A couple days old  No-B  French fish here  See  That would work  In America's Got Talent  And then Howard  Could say  I'm a good guy now  And he could hug you  And all  Danny found the clip  Where he's  Look he's on his knees  Consoling  Pierce Morgan  Wasn't consoling anyone  And that's why  The show worked  You had Sharon Osbourne  For that  He's a little kid  Look at he's  Hugging a little  But Pierce would  Never do that  I mean  Once a season  They would  They would show him 
[03:07:00]  Break down  And be sort of  A nice guy  But in general  His role was  To be the prick  And the tough guy  Does Pierce have kids  Howard has kids  Look at that  Little kid crying  Of course you have  To console him  And try to get  His number  Look at it  No but that's  Why the other judges  Are there  So he's doing  The role of  The other guys  That's what I'm saying  Okay I get it  It wasn't supposed  To be a long  Conversation  But you know what  I hope Tom wins  I really do  I'm friends with his wife  And uh  Why are you winking  I did winking  Why are you winking  I can't do this today 
[03:07:30]  I see a wink  I can't do this  I can't have a fake  Conversation  If you don't want  To talk about it  You should have said  You know what  I'd rather not talk about it  I don't bash comics  But don't say one thing  And then give me  All these fucking signals  Like you're a third base coach  No first of all  Maybe I'm trying to  Join a gang  And I'm practicing  Oh right  And I don't  I don't bash comics  What was the wink about  What was in your eye  What was in my eye  Yeah  A fruit fly  A fruit fly  There was a fruit fly  In my eye  And I won't even hear  Come on  I'm telling you 
[03:08:00]  I don't  You've never heard me  Bash comics  I really am not  But you know  He's good  But you know  There's a reason why  He is what he is  He hasn't had  A better career  No  He's just a solid comic  That gets a lot of work  On the road  Yeah he is what he is  And now all of a sudden  I'm praising him  Like he's an amazing comic  Comic on America's Got Talent  And it doesn't match up  That's all I'm saying  And we can move on  Okay  Gary Goldman's funny  Well  Okay  What does that have to do  With anything  I wanted to plug my friend 
[03:08:30]  I like Gary  He's intense  His new fucking CD  It's good  Yeah  We haven't had him on  In a while  People clamoring  For the blowjob audio  Yeah I know  What happened there  Well it was supposed  To be a little thing  And it turns out  To be a thing  Because he's  Giving signals  I can't do that anymore  The fake  The fake shit  You're such a hypocrite  We love Ralphie  That was a joke  Oh  Oh boy  People are now  Going to be  On Twitter  And had the issue 
[03:09:00]  With Ralphie  I don't have an issue  With Ralphie  But he was representing  The show  It's not like a personal thing  It's not personal  Ralphie's been nothing but nice  We stopped having him  On the show  Because his laugh  Drove us nuts  We could say it  Oh okay  He would be like  Ah  Ha ha  That is the  Ah  You're like stop  That was the reason  Yeah  So now it's out there  He's a funny comic  But we couldn't handle  The in the fucking  Microphone laugh  Oh okay  There's a couple guys  That did that  On our show 
[03:09:30]  And it's just tough  To do radio  When  Ah  The funniest  One of the funniest  Fucking things on radio  But then Ralphie  Holds us up  Like the only reason  We're still doing radio  Is because he saved our ass  He sort of saved our ass  One day  Here's the thing  But I think we would have  Skated  I really do  But I thank Ralphie  For helping us out that day  Okay  And hopefully we can have him back  If we can have like  A five foot fucking  Barrier between him  And the microphone  Yeah  We need something 
[03:10:00]  That filters out that  Right  That's all it is  Every time  I like the guy  I think he's hilarious  I really do  And there you go  Me being honest  Without thumbs down  And winks  And ass fucking  Don't say you're being honest  You go  We hope we can have him back  You know how you hope  You can have him back  You go  Let's have him back  You make the decisions  You called me out  Let's have him back  There you go  And I will tell him  He's got to stay  The fuck away  From the microphone  One day I have something to do  You can come back  It's a different story 
[03:10:30]  We are individuals  On this show  I would have no problem  Having Ralphie on the show  You can come back Ralphie  But you can't use the mic  Oh wow  Oh yeah  You got to know  How to use the mic  And you got to sometimes  Back off  And I don't know  It's the most kind hearted  Person on the planet  I like Ralphie  How's he doing  Huh  How's he doing  He's doing great  Fucking guy  Sells out theaters  Is he losing weight  Keeping the weight off  He looked better  How about the podcast  How about it  It's going well  We had a good one  The last one  I told you  I'm a fan  Thank you  I really am  I'm a couple episodes behind

[03:19:30]  There have been times  When I've had anxiety  Yeah  No you were great  Today was fine  I had a good time  And I'm not going to say  You were great today  I love doing radio  With Rich Voss  You know  He'll obsess  I wasn't that good today  But the first hour  I was really good  But the second hour  Wasn't so good  But then I finished strong  I wasn't here  I haven't been here  For a couple months  I took a break  I always like  When Voss is on  No matter what happens  Oh you know  It's a pleasure  To come in  And be amongst  Pals 
[03:20:00]  And good radio  Because you do so much  Bad radio around the country  So do we  And  And there's good radio too  And it is  Around the country  There's great radio  And you know  You have good comics  You have bad comics  Not a lot of good radio  Did you guys see my great  Appearance on Red Eye  The other night  Two nights ago  I heard it was horrendous  Get the fuck out of here  It was good  Oh shit  I heard it was  I heard mine  Mine last night  Was fucking amazing  Yeah mine was good  I rolled  So why don't we play  The audio of your appearance  I don't know 
[03:20:30]  I don't  You know what  It's topical shit  We should get a clip  At least  I'm so good  You can just grab any clip  It doesn't matter  Are you funny or political  I'm very funny  I think  I'm political though  I like doing it  With a little fun though  I'm only just sitting there  Pontificating about  Is it exhausting  To be so damn good  It really is  They send you the subjects  And you gotta kind of  Write a few things  What were your subjects last night  Well there was  Let's say  How to do the Romney 
[03:21:00]  At the NAACP thing  No they were talking about  How Romney  Is behind Obama  With single women  So you know  Do a little bit on that  And how Obama  Used I and me  A lot in the speeches  You know  They just cover some  Political  Single women  So you went with  The racist angle there  Right  Well of course  Not with the dumb broad angle  Thinking they have a shot  With Obama  Like voting for him  You think that happens  Yeah  It's a technical thing 
[03:21:30]  It's like  Oh he's  He's sexier  Yeah  You know what  Here's the thing  We see who's present now  We have an Afro-American president  Afro-American  You are 1960  Yeah I don't know if that's proper  A president of color  I think is  The latest one  That it's okay  And then they'll tell us  That one's not okay  People will say  Hey how is a Mormon  Ever going to be elected  I've never in my life  Said honey  Mormons move next door  Let's put in a security system  Okay 
[03:22:00]  Alright  I've never said to my kids  You better never go out  With a Mormon  Point taken  Point taken  Yes  So don't use  Because he's a Mormon  He won't be elected  Yeah yeah  And people  Now  It's not  What he says  I in every speech  It's what he says after  It's  You know  It's I  Can't believe you're falling  For this bullshit  Okay  Here's what I wanted to ask you  Yes  And this is serious  Because I  And I'm a little  I little to the right  Some to the left  On some issues  I pay $20,000 a year 
[03:22:30]  In health insurance  I pay $20,000  That's about right  Why is it bad  Why should we not have health care  I don't understand  The good and bad points  You're still going to pay $20,000  Doesn't matter  You're still going to pay it  How am I going to pay $20,000  Because this isn't giving people health care  It's making people get health care  And this isn't giving people free health care  This whole fucking thing  Everybody's under the impression  That this Obama thing  Is giving people health care  It's not  It's making it that you now have to get health care  Thank you  Well then they're saying 
[03:23:00]  That then the insurance companies  Have to drop their prices  Do they?  They're going to drop their prices  If they regulate it  If  If  When  So  Well then how  Is the whole  Is the whole country being tricked  Thinking they're getting free health care  I think a lot of people think  This Obamacare thing  Means free health care  And it doesn't  They don't know  People are dumb motherfuckers  And when they hear shit like this  Obama wants to give every American health care insurance  It's like no 
[03:23:30]  He wants us all to have health care insurance  And if you don't  Then the IRS is going to come  Knock at your door for your fucking tax money  A lot of people were yelling on Twitter after that  Saying it's not the IRS  They're full of shit  It is the IRS  I just want to bring it up though  The IRS is in charge of collecting  These penalties  Slash taxes  The IRS is buried so deep in this Obamacare thing  That  And they shouldn't be  The Internal Revenue Service  Has no business being in  Your health care business 
[03:24:00]  Okay  But you're saying  Okay so I guess I am ignorant  So you're saying that  No one's getting free health care out of this  No  This isn't  No  There might be some people getting  Affordable health care  Down the line  But you're still going to pay $20,000  You think your fucking health care insurance  Is going to go down  It might if you get shittier insurance  But you know  It's like car insurance  Same thing  You could get car insurance  And wrap your car around a tree  And you're totally covered  Yeah  Or you could have car insurance 
[03:24:30]  That's kind of shitty  And your deductible's a lot  And your coverage is less  And it's not going to pay  For the entire fucking thing  That's what it's all about  But now you legally  Have to have insurance  Do you know  Fucking the other day  I'm sitting at the blackjack table  The fucking dealer  Draws an ace  They say insurance  Now I had to buy it  Or else they penalize me  Some of my chips  Under the new Obama plan  Doesn't that suck?  I'm down  It sucked  See  How did you do at the casino?  I made five grand  I was playing internet craps  Just on my phone 
[03:25:00]  Oh my god  I'm down ten million dollars  Ten million dollars  Ten million dollars  Ten million dollars  Don't go back to that gambling  I was playing last night in bed  That's the start  And I crapped out so many times  I bit my arm  I was so pissed off  That's a dumb app game  Jimmy thing  Biting the arm  I taught him that  He doesn't bite his arm  That's my fucking release  When you get in there  Is it?  Because I know he does it too  I used to bite right here  In between the bicep  And my shoulder muscle  Right here  I stopped that  Really hard too 
[03:25:30]  I'd bite the head of my dick  Wow you could do that  I wish  You'd watch me for four hours  Sucking my own cock  Whoa here's a joke  We never heard  You wouldn't leave the house  Would you?  No I didn't say that  I said I wouldn't leave work  I just fucked my dick  I'm with Ann on the Obamacare  What?  The health care system  Is fucked up in this country  But the way they're going about it  I don't agree with at all  It's just forcing people  To buy health insurance  Which you know  But it is fucked up 
[03:26:00]  Why don't they just start  Regulating the insurance companies  And stop them from raping everybody  Oh why would they go after those guys?  That's stupid  Rich Voss  They ought to open it up  Because they're fucking  Sending more fucking money  That is dumb  More campaign contributions  Duh  And their fucking  A dumb  Strong lobby is  You know  They're 20,000 a year  20,000 a year  That means you have to make  30 to pay 20  It's insane that you have to pay  20,000 a year for health insurance  It's fucking insane  Okay?  Period  And that's just for myself 
[03:26:30]  My wife and a kid  You know  I'm doing the same thing  You guys don't get health insurance  Through your company?  No!  Not from here  We're like  We're our own entities  So we have to  Subcontractors  Yeah so we get hammered out  We gotta get our own health insurance  So do you buy your employees  Health insurance?  They bang us out  They bang us out  I got employees  And I gotta take care of their health insurance too  Yeah  Or you're gonna be  Penalized if you don't  Mine's over 2,000 a month  Easy  But then how about this?  I'm about 20  How about you just pay the penalty?  If insurance  Well no  I'm gonna have insurance 
[03:27:00]  What happens with you?  But how about this?  You do  But let's say you run a company  You run a fucking organization  And you have to buy your employees  Or you have to  Make available to your employees  Health insurance  How about you just pay the penalty  And don't fucking insure your people  Alright fuck it  I'm not offering health insurance  To my employees anymore  Because  They could go fuck themselves  I'll just pay the penalty  Every year  Because it's cheaper  How about that?  Huh?  Huh?  It depends what the penalty is 
[03:27:30]  I pay about 30,000 a year  I just did the math in my head  Wasn't Walmart taking insurance policies  Out on their employees?  Were they?  That's pretty smart  Yeah  Yeah they were  Pretty good?  I think  I'm asking  I'm not accusing  I don't know  I think  How do you do that?  How do you take insurance out  On people that  Aren't related to you  Aren't related  I've heard of this  But it's like  How does that fucking work?  Yeah there was something going on  Some kind of legal scam  They figured out  I know  Remember when Eatman  Took out fucking insurance policies  On both of us?  Yeah  Just in case you know 
[03:28:00]  Anything happens  He could still get his payday  Well he just did an OB  To make you feel good  I think it's something  It's something called  Vested interest  Oh is it?  Yeah  Briefly it was an insurance  I vaguely remember this  But you're  As long as you can prove  That in some way  You have vested interest  To insure the insured  Then it's perfectly legal  I watch  I have a favorite baseball team  I have a vested interest  So you have to  If that person disappeared  You would have to prove  That there would be  Some kind of loss  That you would have  Yeah something  I've done right  Okay 
[03:28:30]  Alright  Well we should go home  I think  And think about all this stuff  I have a vested interest  In a nap  What about now?  And then I gotta  Fucking go to Rockstar  We gotta do a show tonight  Are you gonna rockstar?

[03:33:00]  At rockstargames.com  You can watch  A live feed  Of  Of all of us  Getting our asses  Kicked  Yeah exactly  Bobby feeding his  Face with barbecue  I have a question  For you Laszlo  Because I don't  Know a lot about  Games I don't  Play them  But is Rockstar  Like competitors  Or like Gamefly  Or are you guys  Connected  Oh my god  Rockstar  That's a very good question  What we do is  We mail out games  In envelopes  We're like  I don't know  I don't know anything  Do you know what  Gamefly is?  Do you know what  Rockstar is? 
[03:33:30]  I know if you go to  My wife hates me  Slash Gamefly  There is definitely  An analogy to be  Made there  It's like saying  Atlantic Records  Is like  BMG Music Service  Yeah  I'm trying to think  Like fucking  Yeah the actual  Record company  Is like that  Columbia House  Record deal  Where you would  Send a penny  And get ten albums  You're comparing  That to the actual  Record company  That puts out  The albums  Yeah they're making  The albums  They make the games  They're making the games  That make the whole 
[03:34:00]  Yeah they do  Oh okay  You don't have  Your own show  Considering this  Amazing grasp  Of the entertainment  Industry  First of all  Let me tell you  Something Gameboy  I don't play  I don't play  That's Nintendo  I don't play games  So I don't fucking  Know okay  If you ask me  Questions about comedy  I'll give you the answer  Or about making  A documentary  But why don't you  Have general knowledge  Cause I don't play  Who's Jack  Is he like  Corporal Smart  Looky don't try  To team up 
[03:34:30]  Cause he's giving you  A fucking cameo  On his dumb game  You lose on this one  Why I don't know  Cause sometimes  You just need  General knowledge  You don't have  To be an expert  On stuff  Okay  Not knowing that  Gamefly and  Rockstar are not  Even close to  The same thing  But if I've never  Went to either  Sites or bought  A game in my life  But you brought up  Gamefly so you  Knew something about it  What did I'm  Pugging them  What do you  Think Gamefly did  I think Gamefly  Sells games  That's what it says  In our podcast  When we're  Doing 
[03:35:00]  Oh my god  It even does  A live read  Alright so  You know what  Gamefly is  They sell games  So then why  Would you think  Rockstar also  Sells games  And aren't actually  The ones creating  Them  They could be  A company  That fucking  I don't know  If you know  Anything about  Pop culture  And what's new  Rockstar has put out  Some of the most  Popular games  In history  I couldn't tell you  What one of the games  Are  How about Grand Theft Auto  GTA  You know what  I had Grand Theft Auto  See  I had it in the beginning  And I couldn't get over  The first wall  So I never played it 
[03:35:30]  I didn't know how to  Get over the first wall  Same thing with your people  Back in the 40s  So don't  This has nothing to do  It's just general knowledge  No it's not general knowledge  Rockstar has been around  Long enough  And they've made  Monster games  That you would just know  You don't have to play them  Yeah  I know the games  All the controversy  That hits  You know  The media  I'm sorry  I'm not in the entertainment  I might be wrong  But I think you should  Just know some of that shit  They've been a fairly popular company  Since like 2000  I mean GTA 2 was a big deal 
[03:36:00]  For a lot of people  I mean it was a game changer  Huge  Huge  All right I'm sorry  I'll do more fucking research  You should  Sorry I asked a dumb question  I'm not in the entertainment business  Your kids aren't into gaming  They don't play video games  I don't talk to them  Sheldah Mack writes  Hope you're smarter than this  You have kids to teach now  Read what the Affordable Care Act is  And stop listening to Ant  You know what Sheldah  You're always giving me shit on Twitter  Oh you know Sheldah  Yeah we'll get into our arguments 
[03:36:30]  And shit  She's a proud ebony princess  Sheldah  I'm a fucking racist  So it's like the odd couple  That's your first problem  Yeah  But no  She likes to twist things around  To best reflect her opinion  And I do the same for mine  But this affordable health care thing  What I'm saying is  Rich Voss is still going to be paying  $20,000 a year for health insurance  So stop it  This isn't  This isn't everyone gets free health care  Dummies  This isn't socialized medicine 
[03:37:00]  You know  Thank God  Why are they trying to pass it off is it?  They're trying to fucking hoodwink everybody  For the same reason  That a lot of people voted for Obama  Under this guise that  They were going to get free everything  Free rent  Free food  Free fucking cars  You know  People in the African American community  Really thought it was going to be  A free ride  After Obama got elected  And I honestly think  There's a lot of disillusioned people  And a lot of people  That voted for Obama  In the first place  Because they wanted to see  The first black president 
[03:37:30]  And I don't think  A lot of these people  Are going to come out  And vote in numbers  Like they did the first time around  Well black people  Are going to support him  Because you  Look at  Just like you  An Italian guy  There's never been an Italian  What does this have to do  With Laszlo's Barbecue  I don't have to book for a god damn  Is Max Payne a liberal  Right  Max Payne  Pops pills and shoots people in the face  Is his gun legal  His gun's legal  Not all of them  No  No  Oh boy  Hey guys  Do you know what time it is  Time to go home  Bullet time  Yeah  There it is
