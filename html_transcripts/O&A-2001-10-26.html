<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of their syndication success in Rochester, NY, juxtaposed with their poor performance and frequent preemption in Chicago (often for minor league hockey), sparking Opie's ire.  They transitioned to promoting their upcoming Halloween party in Boston, expressing reluctance to wear costumes. Opie shared anecdotes about his impoverished childhood and the importance of Halloween for food, leading to a discussion of candy and contrasting childhood experiences.  Personal life details emerged, with Opie jokingly lamenting his girlfriend's pumpkin-carving party plans conflicting with his World Series viewing.  A lengthy debate ensued, marked by vulgar humor, comparing the perceived "gayness" of attending Madonna and No Doubt concerts.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements, the arrival of strippers or porn stars in the studio, further "gayness" scale discussions, and a played recording of "I've Had the Time of My Life" sung by individuals with intellectual disabilities.

The show continued with a segment heavily focused on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, released after 9/11. Opie discussed his anxieties about purchasing the game and the game's altered New York skyline, recalling pre-attack simulated flights near the Twin Towers.  This led to crude, racially charged humor from Opie. A call-in segment followed, including listener suggestions for Anthony's Halloween costume and offensive Asian stereotypes.

Adult film actresses Asia and Kobe Tye then appeared in studio, promoting an anime festival rather than engaging in the hosts' attempts at on-air antics.  Their presence spurred sexually suggestive conversation and jokes, with the hosts expressing frustration at their lack of participation in more explicit activities. This led to further crude humor and self-deprecating remarks.  Larry Storch, known for "F Troop," made a surprise appearance, sharing career anecdotes and escalating the show's irreverent tone. The segment concluded with Opie playing a recording of his mother drunkenly singing Janis Joplin.

A chaotic series of phone interviews and in-studio conversations followed.  Larry Storch was interviewed again, this time with the hosts displaying a lack of familiarity with him. A pre-recorded call impersonating John Rocker to Ted Turner was played, followed by calls from Kid Chris (discussing ratings and a successful prank call to Turner), Jay (sharing a negative anecdote about Storch), and Joe (describing a disappointing encounter with Storch).  The hosts mocked Rush Limbaugh's hearing problems and, with producer Big Kev's help, conducted difficult phone interviews with Bob May (*Lost in Space*), Melanie Patterson (*F Troop*), and Joe Pantaleone (*The Sopranos*), the latter mostly focusing on his perceived rudeness.  The segment concluded with an in-studio interview with Mistress Rhiannon, a dominatrix, graphically describing and showing photos of a botched breast augmentation surgery.

The final segment featured a discussion about permanent lip injections, with a woman detailing the procedure. Mistress Rhiannon was also present, promoting her websites and the show's "Boobalander" contest. Robert England (Freddy Krueger) made a brief comedic call-in appearance. Dr. Carl, a recently eliminated *Survivor* contestant, discussed his experience on the show and his perceived image.  A graphic discussion and visual depiction of a woman's intent to enlarge her breasts on air using a saline injection system followed, accompanied by sexually suggestive banter.  Listener calls and "What Did We Learn?" segments featuring crude observations were included.  The show concluded with promotions for upcoming events, including live broadcasts and concerts, and Mistress Rhiannon gifting adult magazines to the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's Spidey! Spidey!  Wow, I need a drink!  She was a whore. 
[00:00:30]  She was a whore.  I don't want to get any eggs, fellas.  Hey, who's the stripper?  And welcome to the O.P. Anthony Show.  Yeah!  How are you, Anthony? 
[00:01:00]  Very well today.  Very good, very good.  Friday, always a plus when it's Friday.  Uh, okay.  Well, you know, it's the weekend.  I kind of like it.  A couple phone numbers, Anthony.  Yes.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Huh?  Rochester, baby!  Rochester, New York! 
[00:01:30]  Rochester.  Has finally woken up.  Wow, that didn't take long either.  Anywhere else, including Rochester.  Yeah.  The home of Brother Wee's.  Yes.  866-2774.  Wow.  Why are we mentioning Rochester today?  Hmm?  I'll be honest.  When I found out that a station I used to work at, WCMF in Rochester, was picking up our  fine radio program, Anthony.  Yeah.  I was pretty psyched, but then I was pretty bummed to find out that they were gonna delay  it and put it on at night. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  It's never easy when you put this show on later at night.  A little bit of a downer.  We're kind of a daytime show with the whole Whip'em Out Wednesday thing and blah, blah,  blah.  Kind of a drive home, blow off some steam on your way home from work kind of thing.  Well, we got the ratings for Rochester.  Yeah.  Guess who is the number one radio show at night in Rochester?  Who would that be?  Oh, that would be you and I, Anthony.  Ah!  Thank you, Rochester.  Look at that.  Thank you, Brother Wee's.  How'd that happen? 
[00:02:30]  My brother Wee's.  Nice.  Seriously.  Thank you.  He supports the show.  He's the king of Rochester radio.  We're finding if we're on a station where they get it and they support it and they get  the wild bumper stickers and they market it.  We do well.  We do really, really well.  And then on the other hand, there are stations that we are in 40th place in.  Right.  Where we barely beat out Vietnamese stations.  Correct.  We're not going to spend too much time on the Chicago situation today because we found 
[00:03:00]  out that we will be preempted for minor league hockey.  When?  Or we have been preempted for minor league hockey by the time.  Today?  The Army in Chicago hears what we're saying at this very moment.  Son of a bitch.  They're very distraught in Chicago.  There's a new program director that talked to our program director here in New York, Jeremy.  And what's the vibe there we're getting between those two?  Well, the guy's distraught.  He wants to make it work.  He's brand new to the station in the city or at least the station. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  That sounds good.  So when do we go from three to seven?  And he inherited a crappy station.  Great.  When do we go to afternoons?  He goes, I would like the opportunity to talk to Opie and Anthony about their problems  they have with being on this radio station in Chicago.  Uh-huh.  And I said to Jeremy, we will not be talking to this brand new PD in Chicago.  No.  Until they stop preempting us for minor league hockey.  Minor league hockey.  Soon as you make that go away, then we could talk about how we're going to make the show 
[00:04:00]  successful in Chicago.  That's embarrassing.  But, I mean, you've got to start there because he's like, well, what can we do to make  the guys happy and, you know, support the show?  Well?  It's a no-brainer.  It's a no-brainer.  Jesus.  That's embarrassing.  You know, if you're on a show that maybe is like an infomercial or something, and they  preempt it for the hockey, minor league hockey, that's fine.  But you know something?  We've done very well for ourselves in a lot of these cities that support us, and it's 
[00:04:30]  embarrassing to have us on a station that believes we are the kind of show that should  be preempted for things like minor league hockey.  Hockey!  Minor league hockey!  Now, we just mentioned Rochester, okay?  Yeah.  I lived in Rochester for a while.  They have minor league hockey, okay?  Right.  But they don't have professional hockey officially in Rochester, even though a lot of the Rochesterians  like the Sabres, because it's pretty close, Buffalo, okay?  Sure.  They probably get into their minor league team up there, the Amerks. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  All right?  Chicago has the NHL.  Yes.  If we were preempted for the Blackhawks hockey, I would almost understand.  Almost.  Almost.  Almost.  But to be preempted for minor league hockey, that's embarrassing for you and I.  That is embarrassing.  You know, it was all fun at first when we found out we were getting syndicated.  We kept our mouths shut.  Now, we're starting to discover there are some serious problems with our syndication.  Well, you realize when you're syndicated, you got to sort out the bad from the good. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  We visit those cities that treat us nicely, and we do well.  And we are eager to go to the cities that support us.  We love it.  It's fun.  Look what we're doing.  We're going to Boston.  We're going to be going to Washington.  And now there's talk about going out to Sacramento.  Sacramento, possibly.  Come on.  Possibly.  Right?  Yes.  So, you know, just these are the reasons we want to be on stations that support us,  so we can go out and have some fun with them. 
[00:06:00]  Chicago, why the hell would we go and visit the station that preempts us for minor league hockey?  It's funny you mention that because I was reading the email before the show,  and we have a small army in Chicago that are really digging the show,  and they're as frustrated as you and I when they find out that the show won't be on for a few hours  because they have to do their minor league hockey first.  And one guy writes and says,  I'm bummed because it's obvious that you guys will never come and visit us.  Well, at this rate, how could we do that?  Well, maybe we could, you know, have a little sit down at a table at TGIF in Chicago. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, we'll do that.  I mean, there's no...  Being preempted for minor league hockey, it's like dating a girl,  and one time she doesn't show up.  And you find out when she didn't show up that she was doing coke and giving a hummer to a fat guy.  That's what that's like.  It's an insult.  It stinks.  It is an insult.  It's an insult.  And we will get our way.  Yes.  New York knows better than anyone.  Opie and Anthony always win in the end. 
[00:07:00]  Someone should tell Chicago that.  We will not continue on WCKG in Chicago if they're going to continue preempting our show for minor league hockey.  For minor league hockey.  There's no excuse for it.  There's no reason to do it.  You're not going to get people listening to minor league hockey.  And our listeners in Chicago, they're probably listening to this right now at about midnight.  Yeah.  If at all.  If at all. 
[00:07:30]  If at all.  So it's already in the works.  We're going to aggressive, aggressively try to move on.  Yeah.  Go to a station that appreciates the on a show in Chicago.  Right.  Chicago is kind of a kind of a big radio market.  Yeah.  You know, it's like New York and Washington, Philly.  It's another big mark.  And it's filled with a bunch of old timers that are lazy.  Mm hmm.  Yeah.  If we're in the right time slot, we will clean up in Chicago and we just want that opportunity. 
[00:08:00]  What are they waiting for?  Where is the guy that will be dubbed a genius for bringing us in?  Much like Tim Sabian in Philly, who is now acknowledged to being a genius in the industry.  That's right.  He's like people like, oh, my God, look at this guy.  The first PD to pick up the on a show in syndication.  What a ballsy, brave move.  But you know something?  He must have saw something.  That's why he's a talented genius.  P.D.  Tim Sabian.  He saw it. 
[00:08:30]  He ran with it.  And now he's reaping the benefits.  Who is that going to be in Chicago?  Who's going to be dubbed the genius of Chicago?  And before he picked up your show, Tim Sabian was known as just a weird man who wore tight  slacks.  Right.  And now he's the genius weird man who wears tight slacks.  Oedipus, another one, after some arm twisting and neck wringing.  He is now acknowledged as a genius to reinvigorating WBCN by bringing our show to afternoon.  Yeah, but know what happened there?  He finally said uncle. 
[00:09:00]  I know.  We twisted his arms so bad where he finally had to give in.  He had to give in.  If it wasn't for all the drugs we did together in the secret room, I don't think we would  have been on at PCM, but thank God for that.  I think that was the turning point.  Doing the lines of coke on the turntable in the secret room was the turning point.  Finally, he appreciated the idea.  And understood and brought us to town.  Right.  Because quite frankly, Boston should have been the first station we were on in syndication. 
[00:09:30]  No brainer.  It was a no brainer, but we're going with them.  We're cool with how it played out.  Sure.  And the support is there.  Without a doubt.  Matter of fact, the Grave Rave just about sold out.  You and I hosted Monday night with the Crystal Method.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  We're hosting the Halloween costume contest.  What are you dressing as, Ophie?  I will be wearing absolutely...  Nothing?  Nothing.  A pumpkin.  What are you dressing as?  Are you dressing up for the Halloween party?  And how long have you known me? 
[00:10:00]  Many years now.  What will I be wearing at the Halloween party this year?  Look at what you're wearing right now.  Jeans and a leather jacket.  Pretty much it.  Probably not the Islanders hat, but...  Can't bring the Islanders hat up to Boston now.  No.  But that's it?  You're not dressing up?  Rick, what are you dressing up as?  Nothing.  What's Rick going as?  Absolutely nothing.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you dressing up as?  Um, I don't know.  You are!  You are!  No, no, I haven't...  What are you dressing up as? 
[00:10:30]  I haven't decided yet.  What?  I'm just thinking of getting into the spirit of things.  There have been a couple of ideas that have gone through my head.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I'll be an army guy.  Maybe I'll be a cowboy.  You have changed my friend.  You are wearing a costume this year.  I can see it in your eyes.  I don't know.  Yeah!  You going to bring a little pillowcase and stop off for some candy, are you?  Yeah!  I'm going to do some trick-or-treating.  Why wouldn't you get into the spirit of the grave rave, Opie?  And dress up.  Oh, my God. 
[00:11:00]  I'm wearing a costume this year.  I so know it.  I don't know.  You'll have to wait.  Oh, my God.  You know something?  Wait until the time comes and see if I do come out wearing something.  Dude, it better be something over-the-top cool, man.  Really?  Or I will break down on that stage laughing hysterically.  Oh, we'll see.  It's got to be one of those things like, oh, my God.  What a great idea.  Why didn't I think of it?  Really?  And you've got to make sure you're the only person that has that costume on. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  He's dressing up.  Well, we'll see.  Dude, this is our first time back in Boston.  Well, you know, we did a lot of Halloween things back when we were in Boston.  And I never dressed up for that.  And I always kind of missed out.  I felt like I was missing out on something.  All those experiences we made at Spooky World.  And we're just regular guys.  Oh.  And can I tell you by listening?  You guys don't even know how funny this is. 
[00:12:00]  Screw the weekend.  Can it be Monday right now?  Not only have you thought about this, but you've tried your costume on already.  No.  No.  I must say I haven't.  I don't even have it.  I don't even have a costume.  I don't have it.  Can we play guess what Anthony's going to be for Halloween today on the show for a great  prize?  The thing is, I'm not quite sure yet.  I'm really not.  And I've known you long enough.  You are definitely wearing something.  No, no.  Not definitely.  No, no.  You are.  I have ideas.  Now you're trying to bad track.  I saw it in your eyes. 
[00:12:30]  No.  Half idea.  He's going to go home.  He's going to try on a few things and see how it looks.  Johnny Bravo.  No, I'm not dressing as Johnny Bravo.  Well, if you want to guess what Ant's going to be for Halloween.  I know.  We'll do that throughout the show today.  I'm going to guess shoe polish and a Laker jersey and you're going as an AIDS patient.  Oh, God.  Maybe Opie could wear the Lindsay Nelson jacket.  That would be funny.  Hey, man.  That was for TV though.  I thought I was pretty good as Lindsay Nelson.  It was pretty good. 
[00:13:00]  No, I'm not dressing up as Rock Hole.  Hey, what's going on?  Put it this way.  I'm such a wuss when it comes to Halloween.  Yeah.  I don't want a Halloween costume.  I can't even remember when.  It may be when I used to work for WCMF in Rochester.  Really?  That long ago?  Look at CMF getting lots of mentions today in our first break.  But yeah, I think it was way back then.  I don't see you having dressed up as a kid though because your family and upbringing being so poor.  You know, when you're so poor you have to go to school with your lunch in a cement bag. 
[00:13:30]  An empty cement bag.  Sacrete bag.  Let me tell you something.  I'm just thinking Halloween.  You can't afford to cut holes in the sheets.  Those are the good sheets.  Halloween was a big day in my family.  Was it?  We had to spend at least eight hours.  At least.  Doing what?  Collecting the food for the next month.  Oh.  They were hoping we'd get the apples so we could get some fruits in our diet.  Did you trick or treat for UNICEF?  No.  And pocket the money?  No.  The big orange milk container thing. 
[00:14:00]  Trick or treat for UNICEF.  And they'd drop in some change and you'd just take it.  What the hell is UNICEF?  My mom and dad would load up the Volkswagen bus.  Yeah.  Find the rich neighborhoods.  Dick's Hills.  Yeah.  And drop us off.  And I think they would go to the end of a court and have sex.  Oh my god!  And we would have to run around to collect our food for the next month.  Get some grub.  Oh yeah.  Hopefully there'd be the things everyone can eat.  Like you said.  The apples.  But like a cake. 
[00:14:30]  You go to the old ladies' houses and they decide that they're gonna bake a cake or brownies  or something.  I would never eat that.  Worst candy.  Throw it at their house.  Worst candy to get in your little trick or treat bag.  Candy corn.  Hate it.  Eh.  I got a worse one.  Razor blade.  I figured you would say that.  Mary Jane.  Yes!  I hated the Mary Jane toe.  Awful.  Why is the Mary Jane company still in business?  It's horrible stuff.  Worst candy ever.  It really is bad.  That and the candy corn.  I just didn't like that.  I like your nice candy. 
[00:15:00]  You know what was the best?  I'll tell you what the best was.  When you got a god damn Snickers bar.  Not the mini ones though.  Not the mini one.  You went to the house and went, oh this guy's gone.  He's dealing out the Snickers and the Three Musketeers.  Yeah but the word then would get out on the street that Mr. Jones over there on the corner  has the big Snickers bar.  And they'd be gone.  That's why you gotta hit them early.  And then you'd go there and what's up with this man?  But the old people would give you, they would give you the weapons you were gonna use against  their house.  Oh with the apple? 
[00:15:30]  This apple's going through your big plate glass window.  Cake and brownies, that is smeared across your garage door.  The word F, the F word in brownie is gonna be smeared on your door and now you gotta clean  it up.  If you're here at the store, go to the store, buy the bag of candy, give that out.  Then there's people like me, especially when I was living in Greenlawn.  My brokest period, besides when I was living in my car, but my brokest period ever. 
[00:16:00]  I'd have to hide.  I hid on Halloween.  During the day.  They'll go away soon.  They'll go away.  Then you hear them talking.  I thought I saw someone by the window.  Oh.  They'll go away.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Ah, yeah.  Boom.  And fans dressing up when we go to Boston.  I will see.  You're gonna have to see.  If I dress up.  You so are.  You'll have to see.  Nothing wrong with it, but at least admit it.  I'm not admitting anything yet. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  I hate wearing costumes for Halloween to the point where Sandy gets scared.  What?  What's the problem with wearing a costume?  Because I never did it.  You know me for how long, Open?  Eight years.  And when have you seen me dress up for Halloween?  Never.  I never have.  That's why I think this is funny.  I never have.  So I just want to know what is the bad thing about doing it.  I just want to know from everybody.  All right, Ben.  It's stupid.  That's okay.  That's a good answer, I guess. 
[00:17:00]  Let's just.  Let's just.  It's stupid.  You look like an idiot.  But it's Halloween.  I mean, I can stand out there.  Let's just put it this way.  Yeah.  If you were still married.  Yeah.  You would not be wearing a costume.  Hell no!  All the fun had been drained out of my life when I was married.  All the fun drained out.  I wanted to dress up as someone else and leave.  That's what I did.  I dressed up as someone else and I left.  Girlfriend, finding these things are fun again.  Exactly, Opie. 
[00:17:30]  At least admit it.  Well, it is.  You know.  That's what's going on.  You got it.  That's fine.  You got it.  You know.  I'm having.  I'm in a renaissance of fun.  I'm having fun.  Dude, because if you were still married, you'd be on stage with me right next to me.  Jeans.  Leather jackets.  Yeah.  Baseball hats.  My God.  How much longer can I stay up on the stage?  Because I know what's waiting for me when I get off.  You're right.  There was no fun.  Christmas wasn't even fun for me.  Just make sure it's a cool costume. 
[00:18:00]  Thank you for coming up to Boston.  It's Christmas time and you're on vacation.  You worked very hard, but it's wonderful you could show up here.  I have an automatic garage door opener I would like you to install on your vacation.  Gee, thanks.  You're right.  The fun had been sucked out of my life and now maybe I want to dress up for Halloween  and have some fun with the rest of the people that show up dressed up at the Grave Rave Opie 
[00:18:30]  and I don't see what's so wrong about it.  I don't see what's so wrong about it.  No one's giving me a straight answer.  I get it.  It's stupid from Ben.  Well, you know what else is retarded too?  All these retarded parties this weekend.  A friend of mine is having a party and you have to wear a costume or they're not letting  you in.  I wouldn't go.  I just would not go.  It's retarded.  Now you're cutting off your nose to spite your face.  That's fine.  You're going to miss a fun time at a party because you decide for some reason that you  don't want to just put something on and enjoy the spirit of the party.  But what are you supposed to be?  I don't know. 
[00:19:00]  Everyone gets into this.  I really don't know.  I have one friend that's dressing up as a pumpkin.  I feel so bad about it.  Well, that's kind of silly.  All right.  I'll give you that.  I got my own dilemma this weekend.  I think dressing as humans.  Good.  Some type of human being.  Plant life.  Things like that.  A thing.  Not good.  Osama.  No.  You're going to get the crap beat.  Anyone thinking about the Osama Bin Laden costume.  You're going to get the crap beat out of you.  And the guys that dress up as chicks.  Gay.  Gay.  Rick did that once.  Didn't you, Rick? 
[00:19:30]  That was in June.  Did you dress as a woman once?  Yeah.  That was in June.  I've never.  It was Halloween somewhere in the world.  I've never been into that either.  I look good though.  Jesus.  How many people are going to dress up as postmen and have gas masks on?  Ah.  Hey.  You're being creative.  Hate it.  Hate it.  That's right.  I'm going as a box of wine.  You should carry a paintbrush and just go as Bob Ross.  Hey. 
[00:20:00]  There you go.  Ben, you said you had the afro thing.  You could be Bob Ross.  Ben has to go to this costume party.  So he's like, I got a dress to get in.  So he just bought a big afro wig and that's what you're wearing.  I'm wearing an afro wig.  But it's.  Screw it.  That's a costume.  I don't know.  So it's not a costume of anything.  You're just going to walk in with the afro wig.  Well, it's retarded.  You see how much these costumes cost too?  It's retarded.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  Stupid.  So I bought an afro wig for five bucks.  I'll have a big afro.  And if people say, what are you supposed to be?  You just say a criminal. 
[00:20:30]  Exactly.  Oh.  Jesus, Norton.  You didn't take your AZT today, did you?  Want to hear my dilemma this weekend?  What's your dilemma?  And it's getting worse and worse.  Sandy is trying to get me to go to a pumpkin carving party.  So, let me get this straight.  Everyone shows up, you get your pumpkin, and you carve it.  Put it this way.  When does the heroin come in to handle this? 
[00:21:00]  All I want to do is get on the train this morning.  Yeah.  She's like, you gotta let me know because they need to know how many pumpkins they have to get.  It's not a bring your own pumpkin.  I'm like, it's a pumpkin.  B-Y-O-P.  Right.  It's a dollar.  It's a dollar.  We'll pick up a couple.  Right.  We'll end up going.  We have to know RSVP so we know how many pumpkins.  I got a pretty good excuse, though, because Joey Pais...  I hope she's not listening right now.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  She usually doesn't.  So, Joey Paisano invited me to check out the World Series game one Saturday. 
[00:21:30]  What?  What?  No brainer in my head.  Oh, Jesus.  Push it.  But she's pushing the pumpkin carving party.  They're in Arizona.  They're in Arizona.  They're in Arizona.  Yeah, right?  No, no, no.  Yeah, just at his house or whatever.  Right.  Okay.  So...  I thought the flight, they were taking a plane out to Arizona.  Oh, that'd be a complete no...  No, just to, you know, hang out.  Hang out, watch the World Series.  Watch the game.  You know we're not going to get to watch the game if we're too busy.  Carving pumpkins.  Oh. 
[00:22:00]  Pumpkin carving World Series with your pals drinking.  So...  Hmm.  So, it's obvious I don't want to go and I'm trying to be nice because I'm like the worst...  I really am the worst.  The worst boyfriend ever.  Ever.  I suck and I know it and I can't fake it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Love my chick, but I can't fake it.  You gonna bring your portable DVD player to the pumpkin thing?  I have a whole story about the stupid new Johnny Depp movie I saw last night, but then  we'll see that for later.  What the, um...  We had a little date and went to a movie last night and I hated it. 
[00:22:30]  The Jack the Ripper one?  Yeah.  You don't like any movies.  From hell.  No, I don't.  Well, it's getting one star, so I'm not alone.  The cinematography was wonderful, Anthony.  Was it?  It sure was.  Well, who directed that?  Anyway, uh...  So, it's the pumpkin carving party, right?  Right.  And Rick, stop laughing over there because you're...  You are...  Rick is going.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right.  I'm laughing at the movie thing.  All right.  Everyone's got their little skeleton in their closet.  You're going.  We have the same circle of friends? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Well, I was brought into this circle because I hang out with this guy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  They do a lot of cute things like fondue dinners and stuff.  Hey, it's not me.  That's the chicks.  The chicks do their little things.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He brought me into a weird circle of people.  They're all nice and stuff, but they do things that I just suck at.  Fondue party?  Let's dip the fondue in the chocolate.  It's a goddamn girl thing that they do once a month.  Don't, don't. 
[00:23:30]  A period?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dude.  In fact, yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Answer this question.  What?  We never had fondue at your apartment.  Well, yeah, but that was for like a party thing.  It was like for food.  A fondue party.  Fondue.  Good food.  Screw you.  So, Rick is going to the pumpkin carving party because it's these group of people.  And I know they're listening and they're wonderful people and I enjoy their company.  I just don't like doing the wacky little things along with it.  So, now, Opie, I gotta jump in though.  As you make fun of me for possibly dressing up for Halloween, make fun of Rick for his 
[00:24:00]  fondue parties and having to go to the pumpkin carving thing that you are going to bow out  of to see the World Series.  Which one of us in this very room goes pumpkin picking in autumn?  I didn't go this year.  I didn't go this year.  You went.  I didn't go this year.  Last year.  And who in here goes driving upstate to look at the foliage change?  That wasn't really true.  Yes, it is.  No.  You guys make more.  You even take pictures.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  We can show pictures of the pumpkin picking.  Dude, I'm not sitting here claiming I'm a cool guy. 
[00:24:30]  I'm just saying.  Now, if there's enough things to throw around in here, the dressing up or pumpkin carving  or pumpkin picking out east.  There's plenty of gayness in my life, trust me.  I mean, the pumpkin picking, it's not that bad to go out east and do it.  Whatever.  It's a day trip by yourself and I can't defend myself.  But I know there's a ton of guys that end up doing this stuff too, okay?  But you've got to draw a line somewhere.  So the pumpkin carving party, it gets worse.  So I come in today and Rick's lovely wife, Linda, is here.  We like to call the beard behind her back. 
[00:25:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Because she's here today.  I'm just kidding.  She's a great lady.  So we're in the office and Linda goes,  So what are you going to be wearing at the pumpkin carving party this weekend?  So it's a costume?  I'm like, what?  I just found this out too.  I'm like, what?  I'm like, what?  I just found out two days ago.  All right.  I'm like, what?  What?  Sandy was too scared to tell me that part of the party.  Because she knows I would just say, forget it.  She knew there was a chance. 
[00:25:30]  She was scared to tell you.  Oh, yeah.  She knew there was a chance if she said, well, you know, we're getting together.  I'm going to carve pumpkins and, you know, and the World Series will be on in the back.  She might just go, ah, I'll show up.  I'll hang out.  I'll watch TV.  Whatever.  But now there's costumes involved.  And it's obvious that whoever goes to this party has to wear a costume.  To carve pumpkins.  You should wear to that a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  God, that's going to stink.  I'm so, I'm so miserable.  If there's anyone out there that needs me to open their mail, just give me a call.  Open it with your nose.  That'll definitely be more fun than a costume party pumpkin carving extravaganza.  Do you think they'll have a little competition who carves like the funniest pumpkin?  Huddle, huddle.  So, Rick, you're obviously going and you obviously know what you're wearing. 
[00:26:30]  No, I have no idea what I'm wearing.  What costume are you wearing?  I have no idea.  Even ask Stinky because he's trying to give me ideas in the office.  God, we're too old with costumes.  I don't think, you know, I'm thinking more.  Shut up!  You've changed.  I'm not even listening to your crap today.  I'm thinking more.  You used to think more like me.  Shut up!  Well, at the grave rave, it's a party.  Everyone's going to be drinking, having some fun.  And that's what I say.  You know, a little involvement, having some fun. 
[00:27:00]  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  What happened to my friends?  Exactly.  The only guy in here I want to talk to right now is Ben.  Because he's going to drink through the holidays.  Jim, with a big afro wig.  There was a problem somewhere with an afro wig.  Jim, I'm fighting this one.  I'm fighting.  I will not be wearing a costume.  What if it'll let you into the old pumpkin carving extravaganza?  I will be at Joey Paisano's house watching game one of the World Series and I hope to  God there's no costumes involved over there.  Every guy that goes to that pumpkin carving thing should have a mule handed to him so he 
[00:27:30]  can just rub it on his face while he's carving.  That stinks.  Oh, God.  That's good.  Good God.  Your brother wants in.  Wearing tight slacks and dressed as Tim Sabian.  Brother Joe.  I'm listening to this and it just sounds like a room full of homos.  I'm sorry, man.  No.  You guys just got it.  You guys got it.  You got to stop talking about this stuff.  Jim, except for you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Please.  Just a room full of homos.  I'm sorry, man.  No.  You guys just got it.  You guys got it.  You got to stop talking about this stuff.  Jim, except for you.  Thank you. 
[00:28:00]  Please.  Just a room full of homos.  I swear to God.  Like you're Mr. All Man.  Never did anything.  I've been to enough family functions where I've seen you dance, my friend.  Yeah, but I don't put my arms up over my head.  If that ain't a fun sight to watch.  Joe, all you need is the big junk protruding out of your can.  Yeah.  Come on.  Danson's one thing with pumpkin carving and dressing up in costumes.  Joe, Joe, Joe, you challenged us now.  So now we're going to have to play this one out. 
[00:28:30]  Okay.  We were at your wedding, right?  Mr. Sunglass-wearing, fake guitar-playing guy.  Should I get the Bob Seger off the show?  I got to go.  Who was leading the conga line?  The conga line.  What is this wedding you speak of?  Who did the kick line, New York, New York?  Who was leading that conga line into the kitchen because it was cool?  And who were the guys sitting at the table drinking going, this ain't going to last? 
[00:29:00]  All right.  But what about after?  I mean, what about when the woman was gone?  Come on.  After the woman's gone.  That's the problem right there.  That was a classic wedding.  Mike DeNicola has a joke about that.  When you go to a wedding and you know it's not going to last and you have $100 in the envelope  and you go, I screw this, and you take $50 back.  Yeah.  That was Joe's wedding.  Then you go to the bar, buy some drinks, put the change back in the envelope.  That was Joe's wedding.  And thank God for that.  All right, Joe.  We shut you down.  All right.  Yes, you did. 
[00:29:30]  We just blasted you with a nice dosage of Cipro.  By the way, Rochester, you doing well up there?  Of course.  We knocked you right the F down.  That's very cool.  You doing good up in Rochester?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good, because we'll be playing up there on the 16th and 17th at Fat Moe's.  Fat Moe's, 16th and 17th.  Yes, sirree.  The Good Rats?  Yeah.  The Good Rats gig?  The Good Rats gig.  Yeah, and Wheezer's been great with us up there, too.  Joe, it's very appropriate that a place called Moe's is plugged on this program today.  It is, right? 
[00:30:00]  All right, fellas.  Have a good day.  All right, man.  Later.  You just haven't been around long enough.  We'll get something out of you.  Dude, I'm a consistent piece of filth.  He's proud of everything, though.  We will get something out of you.  He's proud of it.  Look, it will be brutal, my friend.  I admitted a tranny performing treats on me, and that's still not as gay as pumpkin carving.  Even if I had reciprocated, it wouldn't be that gay.  Wow.  All right.  It's going to be one of those days, my friend.  Oh, yeah.  But, yeah, we started, and we should say it again. 
[00:30:30]  Thank you, Rochester.  Yeah.  For making us number one at night.  And thank you, Brother Wheeze, my pal, for supporting the show.  Great job.  Good job.  All right.  We'll be back.  The phones are just lit, so we'll go to you guys next.  And there's so much to do.  I don't know.  Oh, a boob-a-lantern?  Yep.  Yeah.  More girls on the way.  Cool.  A lot of people are suggesting that the girls should, like, draw stuff on their boobs so  that...  So you could see it?  I don't know if it would work, though. 
[00:31:00]  It's just the standard vein and areola, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  When you see it lit up behind there.  Looks like the dark storm spot on Jupiter.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Right?  It definitely does.  Definitely.  There's some great pictures of the contestants at opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  That's a website you should get familiar with if you're going to become a fan of this  radio program, okay?  Right.  And there's a link to that on opiananthony.com.  We'll be back.  Opie. 
[00:31:30]  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's funny.  It's no Bob with a Bob, but it's alright.  That's pretty good.  Slays from Kid Rock.  Forever.  Rumors running rampant that he got Pam pregnant.  That's a mistake.  Jesus. 
[00:32:00]  My God.  She's trying to destroy that body.  What the hell do you do?  She's not doing a good job though.  We saw her at the VMAs walk in.  Yeah.  She looks great.  Un-effing-believable, man.  Alright, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The abuse is flying.  Ah, of course.  Can I correct your Opie to say that not even that DVD would make a pumpkin carving party  cool?  Alright.  You know what would make that cool?  You're really distraught.  It really bugs me.  The only way I will accept you doing this, the only way is if you dress up like OJ and 
[00:32:30]  carve up two pumpkins on the front walk.  That would be fun.  Hello.  Nah.  Sandy knows I'm not going, so.  Knows you're not going.  Nah, I just...  No.  And then show up and be the only one without a costume?  No.  Instant feedback, Anthony.  Alright.  Somebody's name who I can't pronounce.  Ant is dressing as Gwen Stefani from No Doubt.  Ah, it's out of the bag. 
[00:33:00]  Gwen Stefani.  I'm going to show my tummy.  Come on.  And you'll be able to see what her latest look is as you check out the No Doubt show  tonight.  Ah, yes.  I'm going to Irving Plaza.  Check out the No Doubt show tonight.  That's right, Opie.  Is there a problem?  Wow.  Look, Madonna.  I don't even want to hear it. 
[00:33:30]  Madonna.  You went to Madonna.  Don't even say...  More gay than no doubt.  No way.  Madonna, more gay than no doubt.  No way.  More gay than no doubt.  No way.  Holy Jesus, I'm totally sticking to my guns here.  I'm not saying that going to see no doubt is the ultimate in masculinity.  Both are pretty...  But Madonna, more gay than no doubt.  No way.  Both are pretty gay, but Madonna is not as gay as going to see no doubt.  Dude, how many gay men...  There's guys in the no doubt band that perform with their cute little midriff shirts. 
[00:34:00]  I could care less.  I know damn well the crowd that went to see Madonna was gay men.  Gay men.  And the women that were there were gay men dressed as women.  Oh, there will be no gay men in no doubt.  Okay.  I'm sure there will be, but you can't tell me Madonna is less gay to go see than no doubt.  No way.  I would rather admit that I went to see Madonna than no doubt.  Without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  As far as gayness goes, no way.  Madonna's an icon.  Of gayness!  No! 
[00:34:30]  Not totally!  Rock Hudson was an icon.  Yeah, really.  Will you shut up?  Jim's not going to want to hang out with us anymore.  I have to say that I believe going to a no doubt show less gay than going to Madonna.  No way.  Oh my God, Madonna's one step away from going to Cher.  No way.  Less gay.  Less gay than Madonna.  I rest my case.  This is no doubt.  I've never heard of it.  It's less gay than Madonna. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, Jim, where are you going?  You don't want to hang with us anymore?  No, I'm actually going to get to the Meadowlands early for the December 23rd Aussie show.  All right.  Well, we know you.  Will you be dancing to I'm just a girl?  No.  I won't be.  You know I'm going with my girl.  She's a no doubt fan.  But I'm not going to say that Madonna is less gay to go to. 
[00:35:30]  There's no way.  I went to Madonna because Sandy wanted to go, but I could easily admit that I had no problem checking her out as well.  And I'm saying I don't have a problem checking out no doubt.  But as far as gayness goes, look at Gilson, you're both gay.  Norton, feed him a couple of AIDS.  I think this show just went from 40th to 3rd in San Francisco.  Look at this.  On the gay scale, Madonna equals Marco, no doubt equals Rick.  Okay. 
[00:36:00]  Ann is right.  Madonna the ultimate gay performance.  Dude, this is, I am sticking with my decision.  Madonna not as gay as.  Madonna more gay.  No doubt.  Madonna more gay.  Hey, go with the crowdie.  I'm with Anthony.  Madonna more gay.  More gay.  I have not seen one yet that agrees with your point on this.  They're going to see, they love to hate me though on this show.  So I can handle that.  No, no, this is something.  I can handle that.  It's all right. 
[00:36:30]  Does it matter if you drank out of 30 mules or 26 mules?  The bottom line is you drank out of mules.  Madonna more gay.  Norton is so pumped.  He's like, man, telling all his comedy friends, comedian friends,  hey, I'm hanging out with these guys now.  They're really cool.  I'm enjoying helping them out with the show.  You are so pumped.  Frank brings up a good point.  Didn't Anthony go see no doubt once already?  Going twice, definitely more gay.  Thank you.  You've seen them already?  Have you seen them already?  Yeah, yeah.  Down at that Roseland. 
[00:37:00]  How disappointed he is.  Norton.  I'm really hurt.  Well, what can I say?  Someone find out we're Slipknot's playing.  I think we all need to get on a plane.  Madonna, gayer, Madonna.  Whatever.  There you go.  Like, whatever.  All right.  Jerry for medicine.  Heyo, maybe you could get out of this pumpkin carving party  by telling Sandy you want to go to the pumpkin carving party as OJ.  Yes.  Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com. 
[00:37:30]  Anthony, are you going to bring a PBA card and go as Psycho Mark?  When you dress up for the Boston gig?  Everyone knows me.  All right.  Wow.  Can we move on to less gay stuff?  Less gay than this?  Like Broadway or something?  Like glory holes.  What a mess.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Bob, I'm just curious.  Before you start carving your pumpkin, do you have to check your shirt at the door?  Rick, the pumpkin carving party, do you have to check your shirt at the door like you did at the gay bar you went to over the weekend? 
[00:38:00]  The rocks.  The rocks.  Or is that where the party is?  Jim, Monday we'll be broadcasting live from WBCN, and why don't you call up and ask me how the pumpkin carving party was?  Well, one more thing, pal.  Listen, I'm a diehard Yankee fan like Anthony is.  You only have three more hours to start talking about the Arizona Diamondbacks.  So let's start up on that, okay kiddo?  Have a good weekend.  All right there, Pally.  Kurt Schilling is going to get the job done, my friend. 
[00:38:30]  He's going to get the job done.  All right.  Michael, what's up?  Opie.  Yeah.  Why do you do this to yourself all the time, man?  What do you mean?  I mean, you talk about the pumpkin picking.  That's far enough.  Now you're talking about going to a party.  Why do you do this?  But I'm not going.  Yeah, you are.  No, I swear I'm not going.  No, I know, but he won't go.  Michael, I know why I bring it up.  Because I know I'm not the only one out there that is faced with these ridiculous decisions.  I agree, but it wasn't okay when you were in New York.  Now you're syndicated, my friend.  Now everybody knows you're going to be whooped all over the country. 
[00:39:00]  No, I will not be going.  Sandy already knows.  I mean, let me ask you a question.  Are you just really truly a nice guy, or is the sex that good?  No, my girlfriend's cool.  My girlfriend's cool.  I'm just a lousy boyfriend.  I'm the worst.  And I openly admit it.  I suck.  What?  And I got to admit, I don't care how many times Anthony went to, no doubt, Madonna's definitely  pooped to Laura without a doubt.  I've got to stick to my guns on this one.  All right, Opie.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  I'm just very depressed over it, man.  I mean, you just bring it out in the open and people are going to rip into you.  Ray of Light is a fine song by Madonna.  To have gay sex, too?  No.  Did you see the crowd that went to that Madonna show at the garden?  It was men dressed in the like a virgin dresses.  Yep.  Men!  You won't see it.  You'll see 14-year-old girls dressed with pink hair, no doubt.  There will be no...  But what's wrong with that?  And you know they all looked at him.  Blonde, virgin, everybody was staring at him.  It's a pedo's dream at a friggin' no doubt show. 
[00:40:00]  I'll agree with that, but not a gay thing.  Word, what's up?  Yo, open Anthony.  Hey.  Norton.  Friday.  I just wanted to tell you that, unfortunately...  You know, and I remember talking to your girlfriend.  Yeah?  No, because I can't let this go.  Of course not.  If she told you to get Madonna tickets, you would have been sitting right there at the garden.  Thank you.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  Let me think.  I'm honestly thinking. 
[00:40:30]  You know something?  You're probably right.  Your girlfriend wants to go see Madonna.  You are going, my friend.  You know something?  You're right.  But, I would not then use that concert to show how manly I was when you went to some  other concert.  Because there's no way you could tell me that seeing Madonna is less gay than seeing...  That's probably the only concert I ever went to that wasn't manly.  Name one more.  You went to Yanni.  You went to Yanni.  I said it before you guys had a chance.  You went to Yanni.  Look at Norton's face!  Look at Norton's face! 
[00:41:00]  Look at Norton's face!  Dude, Yanni and Madonna is...  Hey, they're...  Wow.  Many years apart though, my friend.  Help me out here.  I feel laughing outside.  Oh, that's great.  Yanni had a fine CD called Keys to the Imagination that I kind of enjoyed.  Wow!  You know the name?  Of one CD!  Oh, man!  Then his later stuff got a little too jazzy for my taste.  Dude, I've never heard of Yanni's song.  Yanni, he was more in the New Age category with the Keys to the Imagination CD. 
[00:41:30]  When he started performing at the Parthenon and at the whatever, yeah, he got a lot gayer.  I never knew so much about Yanni.  That's great.  Every single one of you have heard Yanni's Key to the Imagination CD and you don't even know it.  Why? What is it?  Have you ever watched a sporting event?  Mm-hmm.  Rest my case.  NBC.  That's how they use it.  NBA Finals.  When they do those profiles or the start of the NBA championships and they show Jordan and it's a whole montage. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, yeah, and they play that music.  Just every single song from Keys to the Imagination.  Well, that makes them manly.  But we never want to see them live to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alright.  You know something?  Yanni, more manly than Madonna.  Going to see Madonna.  I don't know.  I'll say that.  Madonna, the ultimate gay show.  Dude, unless you want to see Streisand.  I didn't mind Madonna.  That's pretty much the only gayer show you could go to is Streisand. 
[00:42:30]  Period.  I wouldn't go to see Streisand.  Streisand and then Madonna.  Madonna I had no problem seeing.  Icon, been around forever.  Wasn't a bad stage show.  Some of the tunes were alright.  Some of it sucked.  That's my review.  But that's fine.  Madonna's younger gay men.  Strapping with nice abs.  Yanni is more the 50 plus gay gentleman.  Looking for the steady life mate.  Yeah.  Who likes a younger lad.  Yeah.  But is Streisand with his older partner.  Okay. 
[00:43:00]  How do you know?  Because common sense dictates.  You know, I sure thought we were trying to go into a less gay direction about ten minutes ago.  I'll tell you another show I've seen.  What?  About everyone out there by now.  Uh huh.  Kitaro.  Kitaro.  Un-effing believable.  What's that?  In the same genre.  Not the guy that wore the mask with the sword.  In the same genre as in early Yanni.  New Age.  New Age.  Sure.  Right?  I saw Kitaro at Carnegie Hall.  Wow. 
[00:43:30]  Okay.  A little cultural event there then.  Unbelievable.  Well that's culture.  And very different.  That's not Madonna.  You saw the clips of the garden man.  Madonna's here at the garden.  Let's talk about the Madonna thing.  This is fabulous.  She is a goddess.  And I can't believe I'm here.  And the guy is dressed in the like a virgin gown.  We went over the Madonna thing.  Why are we rehashing it?  You guys threw a lot at me and I took it.  Alright.  Are you talking about your night at the show? 
[00:44:00]  I was going to lie to you.  It wasn't a bad show.  Alright.  You know.  Would I search out a Madonna show?  Of course not.  Okay.  Listeners would say I would.  Whatever.  Have fun with that.  But the fact is I wouldn't search that.  I went to Madonna.  Is that so wrong?  Is that so wrong?  What time are we raffling off the rent tickets?  I would not go see Celine Dion. 
[00:44:30]  Celine Dion probably still horrid but less gay than Madonna.  At least you see camel toe.  In that jumpsuit.  I love that.  Awful.  Alright.  We have to take another break.  We got strippers here.  We got what?  Porn stars?  Thank God.  Bring on the strippers.  Wow.  Really?  They're porn stars.  What?  Animation?  What?  What are you saying?  I'll show you the DVDs.  They sent us some DVDs.  Are these live women?  Yeah.  They're live women. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you.  That's all I wanted to hear.  Are they going to be in the Booba Lantern contest?  Unfortunately no.  It turns out that their breasts are not fake.  They're actually real.  We'll be the judge of that.  What's wrong with that?  That's nice.  Have you tried it with real boobs yet?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Alright.  I just want to know.  Well you can try it but it doesn't work.  Okay.  It'll work but you really need a high powered light.  I know.  Okay.  I just wanted to know what it looked like if it was just nothing or you got a little  bit of glow.  Light reflects nicely in water.  Oh I know.  That's why it works.  It goes off.  Sure.  Sure.  You only need one little light to light up your whole swimming pool. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  That's true.  Right.  Very good.  Sure.  I never thought of it that way.  Oh Christ.  You guys don't even know.  I'm not even.  I'm not in the mood for this but I'll play it out.  Heather.  Hi.  Opie I'm going to stick up for you here.  Go ahead.  You can't be that gay if you didn't like the Phantom of the Opera.  Right.  So he can't be that gay.  You went to the Phantom of the Opera you didn't like that.  Although he did like Sebastian Bach in Jekyll and Hyde.  Jekyll and Hyde. 
[00:46:00]  I didn't mind Jekyll and Hyde.  I hated Phantom of the Opera.  Why don't we just rent chariots of fire and all whack our bags together.  Can we talk about the cool things I've gone to?  Oh.  Madonna is a peace loving megalomaniac.  Gwen Stefani is a talentless bitch that sounds like she's still squealing from seeing the coat hanger.  And then you can just imagine what happens there.  Thank you James from Brooklyn putting it in total perspective. 
[00:46:30]  Nice thing.  I don't mind some of the No Doubt songs.  Ah there you go.  The one she did recently with that rap artist in the car.  Right.  Kinda catchy.  What?  No not the stupid marmalade crap.  The fat chick.  No no.  The fat chick.  She wasn't even in the marmalade thing was she?  She did the thing with Moby that was pretty good.  Moby song very cool.  Yeah.  And the one where they're in the car and the car's hopping and stuff.  Yeah yeah.  With the hip hop.  Eve.  Eve.  With Eve.  Yeah.  It's an alright song. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah there you go.  Sure.  Let's all put our junk away and get back to this program.  And yeah it shouldn't go unnoticed because we're on in a lot of cities.  Yes Anthony did go see Aida last year.  Okay.  Aida.  Aida more gay than Phantom of the Opera.  I will say Aida probably the gayest play on Broadway.  Aside from if you want to go off Broadway and see Legs Diamond or something.  I might have a little on you as far as gay Broadway shows go. 
[00:47:30]  Please don't use things like a little on you and stuff like that.  I think I'm less gay as far as who has seen Broadway shows.  Okay.  Do you know what would be less gay than this if we all stood in a circle and there was  a cracker on the floor.  The circle crank.  I gotcha.  Alright.  Well that could be in drunk.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Going for the cheap laugh.  Alright.  While we listen to Madonna records.  Can we play something cool going into break?  Please.  Please.  Like retard singing or something. 
[00:48:00]  Do we have time for the retard song?  I love that one.  Can we play the I had the time of my life as we go to break?  Please.  We played that late yesterday and this is such a great song.  It was an event at some retarded organization like a camp or something and there was karaoke  and a retarded girl and a retarded boy sang I had the time of my life from Dirty Dancing.  Right.  And as only retards can sing it.  Right.  We're used to uh...  Who sang this originally? 
[00:48:30]  Like one guy from uh...  I don't know.  Joe Cocker, Jennifer Warren?  Yeah, something like that.  Whatever.  Who cares?  That's the answer.  I wanted to see who was gay enough to know this who sang it.  Come on.  I'm wrong though.  Should we play the whole thing?  Do we have time?  Eh, get through a verse and a chorus or something.  I don't know.  I think it gets funnier as it goes on though.  It really does.  They're just sitting up here.  That's why we're talking over it.  So we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Check out a couple of retards doing karaoke.  This time we're going to sing just like we do. 
[00:49:00]  Duh.  Let's go.  There we go.  There we go.  I've had the time of my life Now I never felt this way before  I've been waiting for so long Now I've finally found this fun to stay by me.  I've been waiting for so long Now I finally found this fun to stay by me.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh. 
[00:49:30]  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, every time you get in our lives, it's a way because it's like it's easy for me.  So we take each other's hand, something that you understand.  Just remember what you're with the one thing.  So I tell you something, there could be love because I've had the time of my life that I've never felt like this before. 
[00:50:30]  Yes, I swear, if you choose, that I hold you.  Hey, baby!  When my body and soul's gone, you know that you'd never know. 
[00:51:00]  Too tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no.  Your voice or your mind, you say, stay with me tonight.  Me, say remember, all the onesie, I can't get in the box. 
[00:51:30]  So I'll tell you something, there could be love because I've had the time of my life that I've never felt like this before.  When my life lands, it's a dream of my life that I've never felt like this before. 
[00:52:00]  All the onesie, I can't get in the box.  I've had the time of my life that I've never felt like this before.  When my life comes, it's a dream that I've never felt like this before.  And I've done  And I've done  And I've done  And I've done 
[00:52:30]  Oh, I've had  The time of my life  And I've never felt  This way before  But I swear 
[00:53:00]  This is the truth  And I owe it all to you  And I've had  The time of my life  And I've never felt  This way before  But I swear  This is the truth  And I've had  The time of my life  And I've had  The time of my life  And I've had 
[00:53:30]  The time of my life  And I've had  The time of my life  And I've had  The time of my life  The time of my life  And I've had  The time of my life  And I swear  This is the truth  And I owe it all to you  Okay. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  Sounds good, Jeff.  You see me in your parking lot?  My pie?  Yeah, you did fine, Jeff.  Yeah.  Fine.  Now.  Hi, I'm Dave.  I'm Perry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  We're listening to Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  Anthony and Opie.  And you are listening.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Time to start talking about things that are cool.  I had the time of my life.  It's stuck in your brain now, right?  Dude, I need that burn to a CD so I can just play that in my trunk.  It is probably one of the best songs I've ever heard.  That song is up on foundrymusic.com so you can download it for yourself.  But speaking of being cool, the new Crystal Method CD, un-effing believable. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  There's a little taste of Busy Child and we're going to be hanging with the Crystal Method at the Grave Rave in Boston.  Going to have your glow sticks and E.  Yeah.  Glow sticks, always cool.  Can't wait to go to Boston.  The return to Boston for the guys.  Going to be a great time.  All right.  Where are we going now?  Oh, you have to talk about your flight simulator game. 
[00:55:30]  I've been waiting for Microsoft to put out their latest flight simulator program.  You know, I've been into those since they first started, Microsoft.  The very archaic graphics was just two lines on a screen and that was your runway.  Back in the olden day, now the graphics are great.  And unfortunately, it kind of got tainted because of the September 11th tragedy. 
[00:56:00]  You know, a lot of people are saying perhaps the terrorists used Microsoft Flight Simulator to train in some of the aircraft that they used.  And the landscape is the same.  It's very accurate as far as a flight simulator that you can get for the public.  So the new one was coming out, Flight Simulator 2002.  And then that happened September 11th and they postponed it.  Just picked it up today.  I was just able to pick it up today.  Went to CompUSA.  And I almost felt like I was buying porno when I was a kid because I had to get the porno. 
[00:56:30]  But then I had to get like another thing that was legit because I didn't want people to think I was buying this for some kind of a bad thing.  You know what I mean?  So I didn't just want to walk up the counter with that.  It's like walking up the counter with diapers and K-Water.  You know, you kind of feel weird about it.  And I've done that.  You're getting the dirty looks, right?  Yeah.  You know, you put it down.  And I also picked up some kind of a submarine battle program just so, you know, hey, I don't think I'm using this for anything. 
[00:57:00]  But I wanted to seem as American as possible when I went up to the counter.  Just because, I don't know, it's one of those things.  You go into a store and feel like the people think you're stealing something.  Because maybe you put your hands in your pocket at some point and you're like, oh, they saw me put my hand in my pocket.  I think I stole something.  Now I've got to walk around with my hands out of my pocket and maybe even hold my pocket open for some dopey reason.  Show them there's nothing in there.  I'm just guilty all the time. 
[00:57:30]  So I walk up to the counter and I'm just like, hi there.  Hi.  Nothing else for me today.  And I'm using American Express for this purchase, for this very traceable purchase.  Thank you, Mr. Doodle Dandy.  Yeah, I know.  Nice to have you.  Your card, Mr. Doodle Dandy.  You know, because I'm thinking, you don't want to walk up to the counter and, oh, Flight Simulator 2002.  Yeah, thank Allah this is in today.  Because I don't know what I would do if this Flight Simulator was not out today. 
[00:58:00]  You're going to overdo the American part of your life.  Right.  Steve, you kind of felt a little weird about buying it.  I can't wait to go home and play this, then take a shower and look at my circumcised member.  Exactly.  You just want to get all the info out that you're on the up and up.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I booted it up there in the office and was doing a couple of test flights.  Of course, I had to try out and see what it looks like, the Manhattan skyline.  They have removed the Twin Towers from the New York landscape on Flight Simulator 2002. 
[00:58:30]  So, and then I was being criticized for my choice of flights.  I don't know one person that picks it up that doesn't try it.  Well.  Stop it.  You know what, though?  The window comes up on the computer.  Oh, you bastard.  Yeah, I know.  I hope he said.  I said, you know, because this is the new 2002 Flight Simulator, I'm like, you continue crashing into the buildings.  Because he used to do this before September 11th.  I didn't do it.  What I would do is take a 747.  He said, because he was drunk. 
[00:59:00]  He didn't do it in the name of God.  I would fly sideways through between the towers.  That is a trick in a 747.  Come on.  But I wouldn't crash into it on purpose.  Well, you didn't know any better at the time.  Flying underneath the Verrazano.  Come on.  It's fun stuff.  There's a cop right there ready to arrest you.  Oh, he's not here.  That's right.  You're not here, right?  No.  So, you know, NYPD on the back, you're not here.  Right. 
[00:59:30]  You try these things because they're available in the simulation.  But I'm saying with the latest version of this, if you do crash into the buildings, you know the FBI is going to be knocking on your door.  They've got that set up now, bro.  Yeah.  It goes through your computer right to the FBI.  They know exactly what you're doing with this.  No, actually, I just wanted to kind of get a cockpit view of what that must have looked like flying into lower Manhattan like that.  And it's creepy.  It's kind of eerie.  You know what I mean?  Even in the flight simulator. 
[01:00:00]  So then I just stopped and I took a night flight over Turkey to fly into something.  What the hell?  Screw it.  I got a Learjet flying into something.  But, yeah, the graphics are great.  I guess if you're into The Sims, I would highly recommend it.  The Sims game?  Yeah, they're flight sims.  Oh.  Flight simulator.  I thought you meant that.  Well, The Sims 2 is a fun game.  I know, but that's on the other side of the spectrum.  Yeah, absolutely.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  I always wondered it.  Now I have unequivocal proof.  Anthony is a black man. 
[01:00:30]  Why?  He felt guilty just going in the store buying something.  If I ain't a black man, my name ain't Mike.  Is that what it feels like?  You're constantly thinking they think you're stealing something?  And the whole thing about, you know, getting something else to cover it up,  to look kind of, you know, like inconspicuous.  Yeah.  That's a black man.  You're a black man, bro.  You got Negro tendencies.  I hear you, B.  Check your sack and make sure it might be growing a little bit.  You got a little afro in you.  Hey, bro.  Are you a black gentleman, Mike? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, of course.  Of course, of course.  I love you.  Hey, we've met before.  They called me Pimp Head.  We was at the Parameter.  Yeah.  I remember you.  Of course.  I had a homegirl.  I love to come in the studio, you know, work my pimp magic every now and then, you know.  Spare checker.  Don't get me.  Is that necessary?  I ain't mad at you because y'all steal my two favorite crackers.  That's right.  I remember that.  You wear your favorite crack?  Hell yeah.  That's right, that's right, that's right.  Mike, thank you. 
[01:01:30]  We appreciate it.  Oh, any time, my brothers.  Any time, anybody?  I want to be black so bad you don't even know.  Peace out, Negro.  All right, let's go to...  I love that guy.  We're his favorite crackers.  Crackers.  Debbie, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Hey.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  What do you got?  Oh, well, I don't know.  You probably remember me.  I was in your studio on October 1st.  Yeah, of course.  Sure.  Yeah, sure you do.  Yeah, Anthony, I have a suggestion for your costume. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  I want to see you do P-Boy.  What dress?  How are you going to dress up like a kid?  How would I dress up like a kid with that?  Pageria.  Pageria.  That's that disease.  It's like a nine-year-old kid that is aged 96 years.  Right.  You've seen him on the talk shows, Adam.  Yeah, it's the Norman Fell disease.  He calls it the Norman Fell disease because every kid looks like Norman Fell.  They do.  It's like you got that disease where you all just look the same.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, you get Down syndrome.  You got that look. 
[01:02:30]  And then the Pageria kids.  Yeah, but with the Down syndrome, you know, they all have different wigs.  And that Asian thing.  I knew someone was going there.  And the what?  And the what?  And the what?  And the what?  And that Asian thing.  No.  You know, if you go to Asia, you're the guy that looks like everyone else.  And, Norton, if you spent more time in sushi restaurants, you would see that they are different looking.  Right.  I happen to enjoy sushi very much.  You do, do you?  Yes, I do.  There you go.  They all do have the flat butts, though. 
[01:03:00]  They can't get away from that.  All.  Different features all have flat butts.  I've never seen in my life a red or blonde-haired Asian person.  I just saw a couple that had great butts.  Yeah.  What?  They had a little Korean in them.  Or Dutch.  Why don't we bring in the...  Oh.  You can't say the S-word.  You just realized, take foot, insert in mouth. 
[01:03:30]  Smooth.  Twist.  Hot Asian porn star outside the studio.  Oops.  Jeez, man.  Hey, is the monitor on today?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hot Asian porn star outside the studio with the flat ass.  How are you?  Her ass is amazing.  Amazing.  There you go.  That means she has some Dutch blood in her.  That's all that means.  Ouch.  Yeah, Adam Farrar is here. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, thanks.  What?  What a lead-in.  You need an introduction every time you come here?  No, no.  I had a plug for children.  That's what I wanted to do.  Follow the hot Asian porn star.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What?  Children.  The Hammerstein Ballroom.  The children that lost their parents in the September 11th disaster.  November 5th at the Hammerstein Ballroom is a benefit to send the kids to school.  And there's a lot of people in...  Look at this.  I get to do an Anthony read.  Ah, yes.  A lot of people will be attending.  Who?  Dan Aykroyd.  Richard Belzer.  Opie.  Chevy Chase. 
[01:04:30]  Opie.  Three, two, one.  What's the count you do at the end?  Uh, Dennis Leary, Colin Quinn, uh, myself, Lenny Clark, um, the Letterman Band, Paul Schaefer's  gonna be there.  Um, and it's, uh, you can get tickets at Smart Tickets at 212-206-1515 or www.smartticks.com.  Good cause.  Very good cause.  It's for children.  What night is it?  November 5th.  Very good.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  For the children.  For the children.  Hey, so what's going on...  Good man. 
[01:05:00]  What's going on with the, the porn, uh, ladies?  You...  Do you want to bring them in?  I hear they don't...  No, that would be bad.  Yeah, well, I bring them in after all this discussion of Yanni and Madonna, no doubt.  I have two hot porn stars in here.  Yeah, but there's a problem.  They don't really want to play.  What?  What?  What?  What do you mean?  They don't really want to play.  What do you mean?  What are you talking about?  They think it's just good enough that they hang with us and don't do anything to earn their  keep.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Porn stars, we like seeing a little demonstration of some pornography.  Rick, uh, told us that one of them would do the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge. 
[01:05:30]  Or at least get naked.  Yeah, do some lesbian stuff.  Is that happening?  And it turns out the guy...  They don't even want to get the titles.  The guy told me, said, yeah, no problem.  But they didn't know anything about it, so...  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Look, look, um...  Who's the guy that said that they're not going to do it?  This guy named Brian out in L.A.  So let's make Brian do the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Look, we have the porn stars in here to do some stuff.  Yeah.  So we can watch and have fun.  And there's, you know, I'm sure they're very nice people and everything, but I can't see just sitting 
[01:06:00]  and talking to a porn star.  Not that we wouldn't want to talk to them, but because of all the gayness in this room  today, you need something.  We need a cleansing.  It's like sorbet.  Sorbet.  There you go.  All right, let's get them in here.  We need a porn star named Sorbet.  There's been too much gayness in this room, and it bugs me.  Yeah, and Sorbet's cleaning it up.  Sorbet wonderful if you don't have a badge of mule juice to chug down.  Excuse me, we have to get rid of the taste of man butter.  Where's the sorbet? 
[01:06:30]  Okay.  Howdy.  Howdy.  Hey, look at this.  Look at this.  Good afternoon.  Very famous.  All right, she doesn't look happy.  Some hot.  Who's not happy?  Are you happy?  Are you all right?  You have like a puss on your face.  A puss?  Smile.  Puss is on my back.  There's no puss on her face now.  What's your name?  Asia.  Asia.  Oh, yeah.  She's a famous porn star. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, she is.  Yeah.  Wow.  And who are you?  Kobe Tye.  Okay.  Awards?  Any awards, ladies?  Starlet of the year.  Starlet of the year?  Back in the day.  And you?  Any awards?  Any adult?  Former of the year, even.  Backer in the day.  Nice.  No best A?  Always got nominated.  You always got nominated for the best A-sex?  But that some girl always beat me out by a couple of those.  Oh, damn that hooah.  She's like the Susan Lucci of A.  Ah. 
[01:07:30]  The Susan Lucci of the A-sex.  I won best boy-girl scene last year.  Best boy-girl scene?  Wow.  That's like pretty good because most of them are boy-girl scenes.  You know, most of them they're getting, you're getting, you're getting your F on him.  You know what I mean?  I didn't think I had a chance.  I wasn't even there to win it.  You weren't?  Who accepted for you?  The boy.  Damn ugly version of me.  Oh, really?  Yeah, my husband went up there.  They didn't have a little video thing.  I'm here filming.  I couldn't be there to accept. 
[01:08:00]  But let me tell you, I want to accept this.  Nothing like that, no?  Because they do that for the enemies.  The Oscars.  We're going on location instead of Dishonorable Discharge.  It's a war film.  You come up on the screen, you're just getting slammed.  Boom, boom.  You know what I mean?  No, huh?  Maybe next time.  Nothing.  Fun, aren't they?  They're very pretty.  Beautiful girls.  That's good.  How'd you get into the wonderful world of adult films? 
[01:08:30]  Anything?  I actually was a topless dancer at Tiffany's Cabaret.  Stop it.  And that led you into adult films?  You took that path.  So many girls just don't take that path.  That's the wrong way around.  May I start from the beginning, though?  I was in college.  My boyfriend got a job transferred to Tiffany's.  Or, actually, to Cleveland, the flats area.  And I was a nanny.  Look at you.  You were on the straight and narrow, college, and the nanny.  And then all...  I did everything I was supposed to do.  And your boyfriend got you into a...  No, actually.  No, no, no.  But the people that lived in the apartment complex, all the girls were gorgeous, beautiful. 
[01:09:00]  None of their husbands worked.  And they had all these boats and jet skis.  Ah.  I'm like, wait a minute.  What happened?  How'd they get that?  And then the people I worked for said, yeah, you should go to Tiffany's.  That's where they all work.  And I'm like, oh.  So I went down amateur night, won, and started working the next day.  But in my...  Be more funny.  If I only worked the 7 to 11 shift Monday through Friday, I wasn't technically a stripper.  Oh, is that...  I didn't work nights or weekends, so... 
[01:09:30]  Oh, okay.  So that's fine with my life.  But then how do you make the jump into the adult films?  Because that's got to be a little traumatic.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Were you like a slutty girl?  No.  You were...  Really?  I always...  Hey, excuse me.  You weren't like a slutty girl, though?  No.  Because I would think that you'd have to kind of be used to getting a few in you.  You know what I mean?  I've always had a boyfriend, and I've always been a, you know, nymphomaniac with the boyfriend.  Ah, right.  But I've always been with just that one boyfriend. 
[01:10:00]  And then all of a sudden, you get an offer to do an adult film.  Sunset Thomas came.  She was a feature.  Oh, sure.  Shut up, Demi.  We know Sunset.  Yeah.  We've had her.  She was the one that did the O at the beginning of the show today.  That's right.  Sunset Thomas, okay.  Yeah, so she pulled me out to L.A.  I did two penthouse layouts, and with penthouse, then I got signed with Vivid.  And what was it like the first time you took a big C for a movie?  Did you feel a little weird?  No, because the guy I worked with was Mickey Ray, and he was so nice. 
[01:10:30]  Mickey Ray?  He was so nice.  All right.  Not the Mickey Ray.  Mickey Ray.  Look at that.  Wait a minute.  Didn't he shoot Martin Luther King?  Yeah, he was.  No, that was James Earl Ray.  Oh.  Different type of weapon.  Mickey Ray.  Okay, so he made it relaxing for you?  Yeah, he made a lot of jokes and made me laugh.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  Lay down.  All right.  I just wanted to know how you got on that track.  That was my story.  There you go.  That stuck into it.  You're very famous, though.  I've seen you a lot over the years.  You're very well known. 
[01:11:00]  300 movies will do that to you.  Wow.  Nice.  Wow.  Yeah, I started the same way she did.  I was a dancer in New Jersey.  It didn't count because in New Jersey, we're a top and a bottom, so.  I didn't recognize you without Bavarian cream on your face.  Whatever they call that.  Right?  I've seen a few of the facials.  That's a great shot in porno, right?  Hello.  It's called what?  Hello.  This thing on.  The money shot.  Hello.  Well, the money shot could also be on the back, though, right? 
[01:11:30]  Well, the girls who are the star of the movie don't usually do a lot of facials because  you have to be in the next scene to do dialogue, and they don't want to wait that long for  you to turn around, so.  Right.  You want stuff cracking off your face while you're delivering that dialogue.  Got milk?  Do they shoot one version for hardcore and one for soft?  Yes.  Because I've been in a lot of hotels very disappointed.  Pissed off.  Yes.  They shoot the version with the fern in the way or the vase.  There is no way to crank one out at a hotel porno.  No.  And I'll tell you why.  Even if you get that fleeting moment of looking at the chick going at it, immediately you're 
[01:12:00]  switched to the guy's face as his veins are popping out of his neck.  Sweating.  And you've got your junk in your hand.  And now you're like, what am I doing?  I found it works just the opposite.  Is it you're looking at some pecs and some arms and all this?  But I don't enjoy the hotel porno.  No.  Not at all.  They cut out the good stuff.  They cut out all the good stuff.  It's like two seconds of the action down below there happening. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  And you get that sweaty guy face.  Hair on his back.  They got you by the nene.  Got the bar.  No, I have myself.  That's just it.  I got myself.  I'm ready to go.  Yeah.  Where else are you going to go?  God forbid you get to the point of no return and they put the guy's face on it and score  you up a line.  The only thing, in a pinch in a hotel, you just wait for the lesbian scene.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to get the girl-on-girl action.  Right.  Then you know you're safe.  Pretty much.  What are you guys promoting today?  I see, like, cartoon.  It's the Hammerstein Ballroom benefit for children.  No.  No.  I'm sorry.  It's a cartoon anime. 
[01:13:00]  It's cartoon hardcore sex.  That's right.  Really?  There's an...  I'd like one.  There's an anime festival, which we're signing at, and it's at the Park Central Hotel.  And we're signing tomorrow, 3 to 6, and Sunday, 11 to 1 and 2 to 4.  They had to do it animated because it's the only way they could show Asian guys with big  junk, right?  Draw it in.  Draw it in because we know that ain't happening, right?  Draw it in, Orton.  Not many Asian guy porn stars.  No.  No.  A lot of Asian women, beautiful. 
[01:13:30]  Actually, not a whole lot of those either.  No.  That's why it's specialty night.  That's it.  But then you get the guy that's just like, what the hell's going on there?  You're trolling the internet, and you see some pictures of some sex scenes, and they  got the Asian guy in there.  You're like, what's this girl wasting her time for?  You ever have sex with the Asian guys?  Ever.  I've never even...  Never, ever.  No?  I did one.  He couldn't get it up.  Oh, my God.  Not only...  Maybe he did, and you just...  I just thought he didn't.  That's how the Asian guys are, right? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Who is that famous Asian porn star, Ohio Patia Lee?  She's not Asian.  No, she's American Indian.  She's American Indian.  My husband was married to her before me.  Oh, really?  Really?  I thought she was Asian.  She's American Indian?  Yeah.  Nice.  Who's the one that did the clown porn that we talked to?  John Wayne Gacy.  No, that was the boyfriend of...  What's her name?  The one that's just insane.  Anna Mall?  Anna Mall.  Anna Mall.  Right.  Anna Mall. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Well...  Oh, she's a trip, that one.  We've had her in here a few times.  Yeah?  Oh, she does that...  You want a hand?  Hey, you ever hear of the Bukkake videos?  You know what that is?  Bukkake?  Not my cup of tea, thank you.  That's very funny.  Cup of tea.  Cup of tea.  They get a bunch of guys together.  Yeah.  And let's just say they make a big fribble in a big glass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big fribble.  Right.  And the girl just chugs it down. 
[01:15:00]  Oh.  And it's all over her face.  Just a big vanilla fribble.  Oh.  Oh.  There's many ways they do it.  How do they get their rocks off looking at all those other guys in front of them?  What kind of incentive is that?  I don't know.  Ask Norton.  How, Norton?  Well, usually I find that I'll go to see No Doubt and Madonna and Nani and Phantom of  the Opera.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  What are you working on now?  Ladies, we were told you guys don't want to really play with us today, though, right?  They're just here promoting.  No playing with the...  Promoting for the festival.  No playing with the boys today. 
[01:15:30]  But we'll be back in December dancing at the gossip.  We can't wait that long.  We'll be doing all kinds of things there at the club.  You can come then.  But not now.  Oh.  This is my hometown.  My parents could be listening.  Like they haven't seen a movie or two?  God, I hope not.  They don't know you're in porno?  You're like, they think she's a nurse.  Wait, you're really...  Just in case you might accidentally see me.  I go, Dad, I'm not on HBO.  He goes, just in case.  I didn't want to take the chance.  Wait a minute.  Your parents really don't know with all the films you've been in?  I don't know.  I ran away a long time ago. 
[01:16:00]  I haven't called home to ask.  Oh, there you go.  I got you.  All right.  Yeah.  Oof.  Imagine that.  All right.  Well, they don't want to play, so...  All right.  Well...  We're not going to fly.  We're there in spirit, though.  Huh?  We're there.  It's kind of weird that, you know, porn stars and we can't, you know...  Man.  You're wearing more clothes than any other girl that's ever come in here.  You're wearing more clothes than Norton.  Yeah.  Norton.  And I'm awful looking.  Two days ago, a woman took off her hair in here.  That's true.  Yeah.  That was a woman.  Are you sure? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  All right.  You got a bunch of clothes on and they're not coming off for the boys.  All right.  You can see it all.  All right.  What's the audience of all the officers?  Huh?  What?  What?  Well, they're not here.  You know something?  Let me just bring something up.  Let's say...  Let's just say, for the sake of argument, we had a room that had a room.  It had a glass wall and see a picture in your head, a glass walled room that was full of  brave NYPD officers that have been at ground zero, that have helped, that have watched colleagues 
[01:17:00]  pass.  And one thing you girls could do to make them happy would be to go in front of this imaginary  window and flash those beautiful breasts of yours at New York's finest, the brave people  that many know, people that have sacrificed their lives, and give them a little joy in  their lives.  Would you agree to something like that?  Go over there.  As a civic duty.  Go over to the hypothetical window. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  Right.  There you go.  Okay.  Feel free.  Ladies, if you would.  Show me what you imagine.  Why not you?  This is all imaginary, right?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Come on.  Hold on.  Why would...  Oh, come on.  These guys, man, they're NYPD.  Yeah.  They're getting oral favors on the streets.  For them, I would.  Yes.  In this case, yes, I would.  You're a porn star and you won't show your boobs to cops? 
[01:18:00]  Let's just say they were.  Of course they're not, but let's say they were.  I'm a cop and nobody fleshed them.  I don't understand.  I hate these two.  No.  Porn stars, I won't get naked.  I was a Boy Scout.  He plays a cop on television.  Does that count?  Can I see the left one?  That's the only time you'll see cops smile when they have guns pulled on them.  Nice.  All right.  Well, thank you, ladies.  All right, ladies.  Thank you.  They're fire department.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Fire department.  Yeah, we see the FDNY boys.  It's like we got a lot of people in this imaginary room.  Just in case it would ever happen.  The imaginary room.  Oh, the secret room?  We got the secret room with cops and firemen.  All right.  It's all imaginary.  Ladies, thank you.  We will watch you.  Look for you in the movies.  Thank you for having me.  Thank you.  There they go.  The beautiful ladies.  Yeah.  I know, but you know.  All right.  Well, I'll.  Okay.  I have a Ferrari, but I keep it in the garage. 
[01:19:00]  You know, you got to drive that around a little bit.  Headlines are on.  Thank you.  There they go.  There they are.  All right.  There they go.  There they go.  The most fully clothed porn stars I've ever seen.  It's good, though, when you.  No, it is actually smart, though.  I love.  Wait, let me just.  I love Ben in these situations.  He doesn't care.  People are in here and Ben's like, oh, shut up.  It's like, no, we don't want to take anything off.  No, Ben's like, oh, I should.  F you.  He's flipping the bird through the door. 
[01:19:30]  I just get so pissed off.  I love it.  I said, I hate these two right to their face.  The good thing is, though, if you're plugging something, I mean, why would you want to go  on a show that's on, like, 16 markets?  We got played so bad.  I mean, who cares?  You're in another porno.  Who cares?  We can't win them all with the ladies down here.  You would think with porn stars we'd be able to get a little fun going on, a little perverted  fun going on.  Good, clean fun.  Right.  But no.  For some reason.  Good booking, Rick. 
[01:20:00]  Enjoy that one.  Yeah, Rick.  Wow.  Eat me.  Wow, Rick.  That's when you're producer of the year at the next Air Award.  You shy porn stars.  You got a couple of nuns coming down at six?  Yeah.  What's happening next?  They'll probably do more.  They'll probably get naked.  Yeah.  It's funny.  They come in, they want to discuss Psalms three through eight.  That was awful.  Make sure we send this tape to the R&R convention so Rick can win producer of the year.  Yeah.  And the winner of the producer of the year award, Rick Delgado for producer of the year. 
[01:20:30]  Sing porn stars that don't do anything.  Rick Delgado.  Here comes Rick to accept his award.  He's wearing a lovely gown.  That wasn't even Zebra.  We were waiting for Zeppelin.  We didn't even get Zebra.  We got Randy Jackson playing all the instruments at the same time.  Not even Randy.  We got the other guy.  Randy Jackson.  That made a bunch of people laugh along. 
[01:21:00]  How does he do it?  He plays all the instruments.  Because he doesn't want to pay the band because he's not making much for the gig.  Who's behind the door?  Two porn stars that don't want to take their clothes off.  It's my mother.  All right.  Well, we'll get back on track next.  How's that sound?  Hey, Rick.  What's next?  The Boy Scout troop?  Look at the clown that's with him.  What?  What?  Look at the slick out there.  Oh, the clown that won't juggle?  That's next hour.  Hey, guys.  Maybe we can walk around selling Nestle Crunch Bars or something after this. 
[01:21:30]  Something else wholesome and fun.  Do you want...  Hey, any ladies that want to come by and get completely naked for us to get the gayness  out of the studio would be greatly appreciated.  Yeah, we need the gayness out of here.  How pathetic are we that we can't even get porn stars to take their clothes off for us?  That happens.  Well, maybe that's why.  They wouldn't even do it for the NYPD, the imaginary NYPD that is in this imaginary room  behind my head.  And there's only in my mind.  Right.  Or maybe we'd get a band down here to not play a song.  Yeah, that's exactly...  You know something, Rick? 
[01:22:00]  Next time you get porn people calling up...  I don't see you guys making the effort to try and get these people in here.  This isn't going to be against you.  I'm saying next time you get a call...  Let me tell you something.  ...because this happens from porn people that want to bring people...  Right.  Bring this up to them.  I mean, I explained to the guy...  The girl walked in here with a winter coat on and a puss on her face.  We weren't going to...  Well, if only she had the puss on her face.  Even Snoop Doggy Dog couldn't work that pimp hand, my friend.  Yes, he could.  No, we couldn't.  Slow down.  Snoop couldn't.  That's Snoop.  Says, next time... 
[01:22:30]  Snoop would get Taliban women taking it off.  The one girl didn't even want to flesh the...  That's what I'm saying here.  The imaginary NYPD in the imaginary room.  Yeah, next time we get a call and it's like, yeah, we got these porn stars.  You tell them, you know something?  Take it up with whoever that was because your porn stars don't do anything.  We get normal girls that come down here and do outlandish things and porn stars do nothing.  I know.  That's great.  That's why I told the guy we wanted a wiffle ball bat challenge and we wanted a fake breast. 
[01:23:00]  They send us this.  We got attitude and cartoons.  Exactly.  It's slick out there.  But this stuff didn't get plugged so...  It was clown.  Why are they still around?  Tell them to go.  Slick's out there.  I don't know.  Tell them to go home.  They're done.  I mean, they're nice girls.  They're nice people, but, you know, nudity.  All right, we got to take a break.  Tell them to go home.  All right.  There's nothing to see here.  Nothing to see.  Move along, Johnny.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid. 
[01:23:30]  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What a mess.  What a mess of a radio show.  Who would have thought we would get porn stars in here that don't want to get naked?  Porn stars that don't get naked?  Who wants that? 
[01:24:00]  Ralph, what's up?  Not too much, man.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Do you ever wonder maybe if these are like contract porno girls, maybe they can't do  nothing, you know, as per their contract, like if they're a vivid girl or a wicked girl,  maybe they can't do nothing.  No.  They just.  What is this world coming to?  They're now wrecking porno.  Exactly.  Remember the days when the porno chicks were in porno because they were skanky maniacs?  Because they loved it.  Yeah.  Because they loved it.  Nowadays, you get the porn stars and they're shy. 
[01:24:30]  They don't want to show nothing.  They didn't even want to like show their breasts.  I hope nobody shows up to that signing as they stink.  We have mothers come in here after having five kids.  They'll show their boobs.  They don't care.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Porn stars that won't even get topless.  I mean, what is going on in this world?  I don't even know.  That's what happens.  That's what happens to the porn stars.  They just get so jaded.  They think they're in the real movies.  Hold on.  I didn't have you on that.  I'm sorry about that.  You know what?  Oh, nothing.  I was talking to Rick.  Oh.  That's acceptable if it's Marilyn Chambers or Seiko or Tracy Lord or like a legend in the business. 
[01:25:00]  Unacceptable.  If you're going to have a porn star on a TV show or radio show, they need to get naked.  We're not having them in here to talk about what's going on in Afghanistan.  That would have been interesting.  What happened to our porn stars?  Ah, the shy porn stars, Anthony.  Who'd have thunk it?  I bet they don't even run away from home anymore.  You heard the one went to college and everything? 
[01:25:30]  Supposedly one of them was a Mensa.  A Mensa chair.  What are you working on now?  My thesis.  Oh, shut up and take your clothes off.  Don't wreck porno for us, too.  It's all we have left.  Only Mensa she knows is the one that's behind her pumping.  What happened to the Mensa, Women's, whatever the, uh, I gotcha.  It's Ramadan.  Oh, that might be it.  What happened to the porn stars that were all coked up and had the skank marks all over their body?  Yeah.  They had some horrible story about how they got into the business. 
[01:26:00]  Man, we all know how that story goes.  And it's a good one.  Awful.  Awful.  That sucked.  And we should be embarrassed.  If the imaginary law enforcement guys, um, uh, that saw the boobs, uh, we're here, I think they'd be called, uh, Timmy, Chris, Ronnie, and Jimmy.  How you doing?  Say hi to the imaginary cops.  Say hi to the boys.  Stone or Sean, what's up?  Oh, man, what do you know?  What are you guys up to, man? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Sean, we haven't talked to you in a while.  What's up?  Shut up.  Do more on the radio, man.  Be quiet.  Shut up, man.  Take that.  Don't leave.  Shut up, man.  They're doing Scorch impressions.  What are you guys doing today?  Uh, we're playing a little a-hole.  Yeah.  I edited myself for the radio.  Good for you.  Don't even get it.  Yeah, so what are you doing?  Do you have to do a little radio show? 
[01:27:00]  What are you playing, a-hole?  The card game, a-hole, right?  Oh, yeah, wait.  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  What?  The card game, a-hole.  Oh, yeah, dude.  We're deep into it, man.  It's rough.  And you're smoking your, uh, your pot?  Sorry, man.  It's like an adjective.  Wait, wait, wait.  I just said it again.  You're cursing.  Stop, stop.  Stop.  You said it twice.  I know.  I know.  I'm sorry.  All right.  No more effort.  I swear.  And-and you're drinking, uh, beer? 
[01:27:30]  You have beer today?  Yeah.  Dude, we-we bought a beer ball.  Yeah.  It's like-it's like you open the fridge, and it's like you pump this stupid-looking box,  and then you have a beer.  It's insane.  It's like, I think-  Pump this stupid-looking box.  Stop it in there.  Shut up, dude.  I can't even hear you guys, because you don't shut up.  How many people-how many people are there with you?  Shut up, man!  Jerk ass!  He's alone.  All right. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, so what are you guys up to?  Doing a little radio show?  Yeah.  All right.  Um-  We just had porn stars in here that didn't get naked.  Uh, no way.  Beat that.  You had a porn chick that didn't get naked?  Yeah.  Uh, is she still there?  No, Sean, you've got to stop cursing.  I know, I'm so sorry, man.  I understand the FCC regulations and whatnot.  Oh, no.  Turn it down, man. 
[01:28:30]  The hot rambling wall, Black Betty.  Turn it down.  Turn it down.  Turn it down.  Turn it down, man.  Turn it down.  Stinky, these guys aren't professionals, don't they?  Yo, hey, dude.  They don't know how to chill.  I'm sorry, man.  My friend turned up the stereo.  I think he was sitting on the remote, and he was all high.  Thanks for the support.  You turn up the radio, and it's not us.  It's Ram Jam by Jack King. 
[01:29:00]  Shut up, shut up, dude.  Hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, so what are you guys up to?  We're going to let you get back to your party, I think.  Oh, bummer, dude.  Are you guys checking out the bombings on TV?  On TV?  Yeah, you're checking out the war on TV?  There's a war?  Yeah.  Who are you fighting, dude?  Iraq?  I said it.  All right, you're a person.  Hold on, hold on.  I meant to say sand ends.  Well, that's better. 
[01:29:30]  I hate those effing sand ends.  We're not fighting Iraq right now.  I think Ben Laden stole my rims, bro.  All right.  Enough of these guys.  Yeah, I'm sorry about the cursing and the being drunk.  Oh, yeah, my bad, man.  All right.  Well, sure.  We'll let you go, sure.  All right.  Right on, man.  All right, have fun.  Hey, you too.  It's always a pleasure. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  Call back later, all right?  As I will.  Turn to the radio.  45 seconds.  The sand ends.  There you go.  Okay.  You know, we should take another break to catch up because the porn stars, besides being  really bad radio, got us off track, too.  Ah, damn it.  We could play your mom singing, though, as we go to break.  Oh, yeah.  We promised people we were going to play this.  Yeah, this goes hand in hand, I guess, with the retards singing. 
[01:30:30]  And Stoner Sean.  Right.  One night, my mom went out with the rest of the family, and she started saying,  Hey, Joe, you know, my brother, you record these songs with Dawn and make her sound really  good and like she can sing and everything.  The thing is, Dawn can sing.  My mother thinks she can sing.  She can't.  So, they were all hammered.  They go back where my brother has a studio and decide to record a song.  And it's my mother singing Mercedes Benz by Janis Joplin. 
[01:31:00]  And it's an abomination.  And it's mom singing.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  My friends all drive cautious.  I must make amends.  Work hard all my life with no help from my friends. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?  Shut up!  My colors is waiting for me.  Quiet.  Oh, f*** me.  I forgot the word.  Shut up!  Hands off!  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, f*** me.  Oh, f*** me.  I own the town.  I own the town.  I own the town.  I own the town.  I own the town.  I own my name.  I own the town.  I own the town.  Quiet.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  My friends all drive Porsche's. 
[01:32:30]  I must make amends.  Work hard all my life with no help from my friends.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  That's it.  I forgot the f***ing words.  I like what I did.  I think.  I don't like it.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Holy smokes. 
[01:33:00]  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Obie and Anthony.  Turfist, drunk, and white trash.  I ain't got you.  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  And you're checking out the Obie and Anthony show.  Hey.  We have regrouped and we're ready to rock for the rest of the show.  Yes.  Like a monkey. 
[01:33:30]  Love to disturb.  Jeff, what's going on today?  You ever notice that when your mom is drinking, she's got serious stripper giggles?  Oh, my mom's got stripper giggles?  Oh, man.  Hey, Jeff, what's wrong with your phone?  Oh, nothing.  Uh, hello.  Can you hear me again?  No, no, no.  Nothing's wrong on your phone.  No, no, no.  You don't know that when your mom is drinking, you're drinking, you're drinking, you're drinking, 
[01:34:00]  you're drinking, you're drinking, you're drinking, you're drinking, you're drinking.  What?  Can you hear me better?  Yeah, we can hear you.  Okay.  You think Aunt's mom has stripper giggle?  Yeah.  Yeah, I can hear that when she laughs.  She got that, uh, you got that, uh, stripper giggle.  Yeah.  Let me, let me tell you something, because Aunt can't say it.  Aunt's mom is really hot.  Oh, really?  Oh, stop.  Your mom's hot.  Oh, she's a fun old gal.  She's, uh, she's, she's got quite a body on her still. 
[01:34:30]  Well, she does keep in shape.  She does, uh, she works out, like, every day.  She's got, I know, she's got, like, muscles and stuff.  She's hot.  She's got a nice...  Mom, what are you doing?  ...hot voice.  Jesus Christ.  Like I said, she's a pleasant old gal.  Not a bad old crone.  At that.  Doesn't look her age.  No, no.  Works out every day.  Nice muscle tone.  Yeah.  Hot!  She's fun.  Hot.  Rose!  She likes to drink, too.  That's always fun. 
[01:35:00]  I've always had something for Aunt's mom, right?  I know.  Relax.  Well, she's, she's a...  She sings like a Bunker Buster bar.  Go get her.  Go get her.  All right, Jeff from Cleveland.  Thank you.  Larry, what's going on?  Hey, listen, over there, you guys rule up here in Boston.  You're building a great big following.  Well, we're coming up, uh, broadcast live Monday and Tuesday, so...  Yeah, I'm psyched.  I can't wait.  And listen, by the way, don't let Aunt's mom, don't let her sing anymore.  No, I... 
[01:35:30]  Crack all the freaking glass in my car.  Crack the glass in your car?  Crack all the freaking glass in my car.  I can't even drive.  I've got spider webs all over the place.  I missed that accent.  Hey, Larry, you got Grave Rave tickets?  Uh, no, I don't.  Would you like, uh, Grave Rave tickets?  Sure.  The show's just about sold out.  We're hosting the Grave Rave in Boston when we're up there, so...  Hold on to the line.  That's Monday night, right?  Monday night.  Awesome, yeah.  All right, hold on. 
[01:36:00]  We'll give you some tickets.  Great, thanks, man.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  What, what?  Uh, nothing.  I was just looking at line 12.  You want to go there or not?  Is that all set up, ready to go, Rick?  Yeah, that's all set up.  And it wasn't mine.  Rick, relax.  Let me tell you something.  Big Kev doing a better job producing the show than you today.  He got us Larry Storch.  What do you get us?  Ah.  You got us porn strip, uh, porn girls that don't get naked.  Yeah.  It's like getting...  They're hotter than Larry Storch.  Someone wrote about that, though.  Give Rick some credit.  He can't get strippers who will take off their clothes, but he did get the penis puppeteers. 
[01:36:30]  Hey, there you go.  Oh, my God.  You're just hanging yourself.  Well, Larry Storch.  Larry.  Okay.  Larry, how you doing?  Fine, thank you.  Yourself?  Good.  I hope.  Very well, Mr. Storch.  Agarn, of course, the beloved character from F Troop.  We all remember that.  Thank you.  I hope, do we?  It is Balloon.  Ah, look at him.  Remember this, Larry? 
[01:37:00]  Larry, I loved F Troop.  The Hakawi Indians.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And Forrest Tucker.  Yeah.  Remember Forrest...  Let me tell you something about Forrest Tucker that you might...  You probably know.  One of the biggest members in Hollywood.  He had one of the biggest mules.  One of the biggest male things in Hollywood.  Larry's got a big mule?  No, not Larry.  Oh.  Larry, you don't have a big mule?  I was under the bed.  I didn't look.  Oh, you didn't look. 
[01:37:30]  No.  But did you ever see Forrest...  Huh?  You ever see Forrest Tucker naked?  No, as I say, I was never allowed under the bed.  No?  No.  Because he's legendary for the size of his junk.  Geez, I'm hearing this for the first time.  Oh, I know.  Tell me about it.  I know, that's a lie.  No, no, you've got to tell me.  Let's talk about it.  That's wonderful.  Tell me about it.  Wait, wait, wait.  We're really talking to Larry Storch?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought he was dead.  No, Larry...  Opie!  Larry...  Mr. Storch. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  I am apologizing for my friend Opie here.  I thought this was a gag.  I know that Larry Storch is involved with a lot of his shows.  He does a lot of live shows.  Larry, I apologize.  I thought...  No, no, no.  I thought someone was setting us up today.  Where did everyone go?  I thought we were having fun.  Jim?  Adam?  He was recently...  Do you know he was recently on Broadway with Reba McIntyre?  Wasn't that right, Larry?  Yes.  And Annie Get Your Gun with Reba McIntyre.  The great Reba McIntyre.  Was he the engine?  Annie Get Your Gun. 
[01:38:30]  Who'd you play in that?  I was Chief Sitting Bull.  Yeah, see?  Oh, he's the engine.  He's the Indian.  Yeah, I deserted the cavalry, and I joined the Sioux Indian tribe.  Right.  Right.  You know, of course, everyone remembers F Troop.  How hard was it to, back then, to actually portray Indians like that without catching flack?  You couldn't do that today, could you?  Well, they've got to, because there are not that many Indians running around today.  Well, thank God for that. 
[01:39:00]  I mean, yeah.  Anybody who fit under a feather, we used them.  Most of them were Jewish guys, weren't they?  Sure.  Yeah.  Most what?  Indian guys?  The whole Hakawi tribe were a bunch of Jewish guys.  Certainly, of course.  Sure.  Everybody knows that.  Chief Sitting Lebowitz.  Chief Sitting Lebowitz?  What?  Larry, I can't even imagine.  What are you doing now?  What do you mean?  Well, I just closed in Annie Get Your Gun.  Right.  And now I'm waiting for the phone to ring and go to work again. 
[01:39:30]  Waiting for something else.  Could there be an F Troop reunion in the future?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know if they would make it.  A lot of them shows coming back.  I see that coming back before a Hogan's Heroes reunion.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to put Nazis in a sitcom these days.  I know, yeah.  They're not as funny as they used to be.  For some reason, the Nazis were funny back in the 60s and early 70s.  Although the producers, the show on Broadway about the Nazis is a standing room only, making a million dollars a night. 
[01:40:00]  That's right.  Springtime for Hitler.  Yeah.  Very, very funny.  Was Larry the guy in the pollution commercial, Anthony?  No, Larry wasn't.  That was the crying Indian guy.  No.  Larry, you weren't the crying Indian guy?  Do you remember Corporal Agarn?  Corporal Agarn.  Do you remember Agarn from F Troop?  No, I never played.  Yeah, I was an Indian once in it.  You were an Indian in F Troop?  Yeah, I tried to join the tribe.  Oh, that's right.  The Hukawi tribe. 
[01:40:30]  There was some wacky thing.  You're always making deals with the Hukawi.  Certainly.  What a great show that was.  I never saw you fight once.  What?  You never used to battle with those guys or nothing.  It was like you guys all got along.  Yes, we did.  We really did.  Larry, did you get along with Bob Crane after the series ended?  I never, I only met Bob Crane once.  Yeah, Bob Crane was in Hogan's Heroes.  Yes, but I only met him once.  I didn't really know him at all.  Yeah, because he had those sex films. 
[01:41:00]  You've got no skeletons in your closet like that, do you?  Hey, when was this F Troop on the air, Ant?  Oh, 1964, 65.  64, 65.  About the same time as Hogan's Heroes and Star Trek was on.  What other shows were up against you back then, Larry?  Was it a big sitcom?  The Dean Martin, the Dean Martin show was on.  The Dean, Dino, of course.  Gilligan's Island, I think, came a little bit after us.  Gilligan's Island.  Brady Bunch.  Carol Burnett, I'm sure.  Probably, yeah.  Maybe, yeah.  And then Kit Carson or some other. 
[01:41:30]  And I remember all of your great appearances on Love American Style.  Well, yeah, I did a lot of those.  You were on a lot of those, Larry.  Very funny guy.  Larry was like the comic actor of the 60s.  Comic actor, huh?  This guy, absolutely.  What happened?  I enjoyed it a lot.  Well, I guess times have changed, Opie.  Times changed a bit.  Now Larry's doing some Broadway.  Right.  Do people still run up to you and, like, you know, and quote lines from the show and stuff  like that? 
[01:42:00]  Hit you with their hat like you used to do?  Oh, yeah.  You take your hat off and hit people with it?  Sarge.  Right, yeah.  I remember that.  That's fabulous.  Of course, see, now Opie, Opie for some reason.  Larry, I gotta, uh, you gotta understand, Opie didn't watch much TV growing up.  Now, I was always watching TV.  Hey, uh, I gotta ask you, you see that Wrangler Jane ever these, uh, these days?  I'll be seeing Wrangler Jane in about a half hour.  Stop it.  We're doing a, she's in town to do a memorabilia show, so I'll see her in about 35 minutes.  Are you gonna be at the memorabilia show? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of, uh, fans of F Troop there to get you autographed?  Well, I hope so.  Hey, Larry, uh, could you send her down to the studio?  Because, uh, we need someone to get naked for us today.  Oh, stop it.  She's a, I, I, I would, is she still an attractive girl?  Because she was.  She's a beautiful woman.  Let me tell you something, Larry.  She's still a looker, right?  Oh, yeah.  She was so effing hot.  Mm-hmm.  Back in those F Troop days, she was wearing that big skin stuff.  Yeah, she had the braids going there.  Yeah.  Larry, I, I, I, you know, you, you were kind of a player back in the day, right? 
[01:43:00]  Kind of a what?  You were kind of a player back in the day when you were on TV.  You know, you, uh, were you a party kind of guy?  No, not really.  No?  No.  I thought you were like the party animal guy.  So, Larry, this, uh, F Troop, was it in color or black and white?  The first year was black and white, second year in color.  I was going to say that.  It was one of the shows that made the transition from black and white to color, much like Gilligan's Island.  How many years did it run, sir?  Because I remember the show.  Larry?  Yeah.  Oh.  How many years did F Troop run? 
[01:43:30]  Two.  That's it?  That's it?  That's it.  But we made, we made about 80 of them.  And so that when they keep showing them over and over again, people thought we were on for five or six years.  Yeah.  80 shows in two years?  Yeah.  What is this, Vaudeville?  Wow.  Wow.  How about that?  Well, you're going to be at the memorabilia show.  Where is that going to be?  Did Larry feel bad when Tiger ran away?  The Meadowlands Sheridan.  The Meadowlands Sheridan.  The Meadowlands Sheridan.  The Meadowlands Sheridan.  Yes, right. 
[01:44:00]  And who else do you know that's going to be there?  I don't know any of the other, I don't know if it's Star Trek or who else is there.  Could it possibly be the guy that was in the robot suit in Lost in Space?  Yes, Anthony, Bob May is in attendance.  Is he really?  Yes, he is.  Big Kev, is there any way we can get Bob May on the phone?  Absolutely.  He'd love to call him.  Hey, Big Kev, how uncomfortable do you feel right now?  That's great.  We love it.  Mr. Storch has to get going.  Okay.  Larry, thank you so much for spending a little time with us. 
[01:44:30]  And you'll always be remembered as the beloved Agarn from F Troop.  Thank you so much.  Thank you very much.  Larry?  Thank you.  Larry?  Yeah.  Do you know who else is like, what other stars might be there besides not Robert Reed?  Who?  Oh.  Pay no mind to Jim Norton, Larry Storch.  Thank you so much.  Okay.  Yeah, that was an age joke.  I apologize for that.  Thank you, Larry Storch.  Okay.  You know, I cannot sit here when one of my childhood television heroes, Larry Storch, is on the phone 
[01:45:00]  and have you guys doing that to them.  I was fascinated talking to Larry Storch.  I grew up watching shows like F Troop and to hear you guys not know who he is and mock  him about that.  That man was a comic actor back in the 60s.  And I'm not going to stand by it.  Norton makes cheap AIDS jokes.  With the great Larry Storch on the phone.  How does he make it?  But then Opie underlines it.  Right.  Has to tell him it's an AIDS joke. 
[01:45:30]  I enjoyed the Larry Storch interview.  Who didn't?  Hey, let's kick Agnes Moorhead.  You know, at this point, I don't think the show could get any worse.  Horror stars that don't take their clothes off.  And sitcom stars from an era when most of our listeners were alive.  Black and white says it all right there.  A show that had to be in black and white because the technology wasn't there for color yet.  Larry Storch has done many, many talkies.  The talkies that I've done. 
[01:46:00]  Did you hear them?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh.  You look like a nice guy.  I'm an old man.  The type of man you'd want to settle down in a hotel with and just roll around a little bit.  Time is over.  Time sucks.  So he was a comedian?  Oh, what happened?  Oh, you're awful.  You just think about the days when they were on TV.  Him and Forrest Tucker going out and just banging the likes of that hot piece of ass that was on that show.  And now it's just, hello. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, I was on F Troop.  Where's my hat?  I still got my hat.  Two years.  Love American style.  400 shows in two years.  Larry Laugh for short.  I am a lawyer, Grandpa.  I wish you could remember that.  All right.  Let's move on and hopefully the show will get better here.  Kid Chris, what's going on, bro?  Hey, that was a super fly on the phone, wasn't it?  Jimmy, super fly.  Hey, the retard thing yesterday was hysterical. 
[01:47:00]  I'm going to send you guys some clips from the CD I have called Special Music by Special People.  Oh, look at you.  Special is a good word.  This is special means retarded.  This is Kid Chris from KXOA.  Yeah, you guys got the good news, right?  I'm hearing we're doing very well in the ratings, yeah.  Yes.  Not bad for, you know, that whole three-hour difference and tape, you know, all that stuff.  Hey, we played the Ted Turner thing yesterday.  It was hilarious. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, I heard that.  I heard that coming into work.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was kind of scary.  You're right.  I was sweating with that.  Did you just get a little bit of adrenaline going?  Yeah, because Ted Turner, believe it or not, he is a big guy.  Yeah.  You never expect them to pick the phone up, though, when you do calls like that.  You always expect to get someone else or just the little ring, a wrong number or something.  And then when they really pick up, they're like, oh, my God, what do I do?  I know.  They handled it great.  And it was right in the heat of the whole John Rocker thing that was going on.  Yeah.  Oh, he thought it was Rocker. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  And the way I got the numbers, I called this place in Montana.  And the guy that lives there, when he's not there, I told him I was Bernard Shaw.  Really?  Yeah, and he gave me his cell number.  Oh, jeez.  Bernie.  His friends call him Bernie Shaw.  Yeah, I kept saying I'm the black one from CNN.  You know, the black one that was getting bombed in Iraq?  That was me.  That was me.  All right, Kid Chris.  We're going to see you guys soon, hopefully.  Yeah, cool.  Hey, thanks for calling in with the ratings thing. 
[01:48:30]  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, we're going to play your Ted Turner thing, because it's great.  Okay.  That's great.  All right, man.  All right, bye.  Bye.  This is our buddy, Kid Chris, from Sacramento.  He sent this in the other day.  Check it out.  He got a hold of Ted Turner.  Yeah.  During the John Rocker thing.  Hello?  Ted.  Yeah.  It's John Rocker.  John.  How are you, Ted?  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?  I'm okay.  How about you?  I'm surprised I got you at this house. 
[01:49:00]  Well, I'm glad you got me.  I was thinking about calling you.  Okay.  How are you doing?  Well, I'm doing okay.  I really think I goof, though.  Well, I know.  I mean, hell, you know, I've opened my big fat mouth many, many times in similar circumstances.  I've apologized to everybody in the goddamn world.  I just was lucky I didn't say quite so much at one time and get in quite as much trouble as you did.  But on a smaller degree, I have.  And I, you know, hell.  I think it just got blown out of proportion. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, well, I agree.  I mean, it's just too bad.  You know, you've learned now.  You know, it's always best to, you know, if you can't say something nice, like in Bambi, what Thumper's mother told him, don't say anything at all.  At least that gets you out of trouble.  And the New York fans poured beer and spit on me up there.  I know, you know, anyway, did they trade you?  No, I just, you know, I'm just a dumb redneck.  You know, I got suspended. 
[01:50:00]  You know, I just didn't know.  Oh, I know that.  All right.  I know.  Now, who had me suspended?  Did the Jews make me get suspended?  You're not John Rocker.  But the same guy that called me.  I love that one.  That's the same guy that called me last time.  He got me again.  Someone just sent me the link.  Wranglerjean.com.  It's Melody Patterson, the one that played Wranglerjean. 
[01:50:30]  What do you see?  Look at her back in the day.  Oh, wow.  Back in the day.  They better not have a current picture.  I want to see a current picture now.  Let me see photos.  There's no way they'll put a current picture up there.  I sure hope they do.  Jay, what's going on?  Oh, guys, I can't tell you what theater I worked at, but he was down doing a benefit for our theater.  Who, Larry?  Larry Storch?  Yeah, Larry Storch.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, go ahead.  And, you know, it's a pretty well-integrated group. 
[01:51:00]  You know, Japanese, a lot of African-Americans and everything.  I was sitting backstage, and I was helping people on and off.  It was like hell at the Catskills, because he was doing a lot of Japanese jokes and a lot of black jokes,  and we were just standing backstage freaking out, you know,  and one of the producers was like, come on, get him off stage, get him off stage.  So we finally had to get him off stage, man.  You know what?  I suddenly like Larry Storch a lot more. 
[01:51:30]  Good for him.  Good for him.  Good for him.  All right, you guys rock, man.  Have a good weekend.  Thank you, Jay.  Good for Larry.  And finally, Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Ain't no one yet a man.  Listen, just a sad Larry Storch, sorry.  I got to see, like, one of the last performances for Eddie Get Your Gun,  and what had happened was outside, waiting for Reba McIntyre and everybody to come out,  all the little kids that are coming out from the play getting people asking for their autographs,  and everybody's waiting, and Larry Storch was just walking, like, pacing back and forth in front of all the people, 
[01:52:00]  and not one person even went near him.  Like, they didn't even know who he was.  And this poor guy standing in the middle of the street with a pen, like, asking for it.  You're going to make me cry, man.  Oh, my God.  It was so funny.  We were all cracking up going, the little three-year-old, four-year-old kids would be like,  oh, look, look, take your autograph for my autograph.  And there's Larry Storch, just standing in the middle of the street, looking like he was this lost little dog, like, 
[01:52:30]  how come nobody wants my autograph?  Like, nobody knew who he was.  It was a very sad moment.  Oh, that is so sad.  It was really messed up.  Well, thanks for that one, John.  Why are you doing anybody?  I'm Agon from F Troop.  I got a pen.  I have a pen, please.  It's always good, though, he called here to feel up good, just to have Opie stick a knife in his spine and twist it.  Oh, hello.  You helped push.  Yeah, all right.  You helped push.  Jeff, what's going on? 
[01:53:00]  Well, I just want to talk about Rush Limbaugh.  He went on today for about two minutes with the buzzing of a disconnected phone line in his ear and didn't hear it.  He just kept talking and talking.  He can't hear anything.  Jeff, you're kidding, right?  No, I'm serious.  Come on.  That is too much.  We've all heard Rush Limbaugh says he's losing his hearing.  Right.  He's pretty much totally for his death.  He's death.  And now he's trying to do his show.  So people have to write what the callers are saying and hold it up to him. 
[01:53:30]  And then he could comment on it.  And now we find out through Jeff that he left the dial tone on during one of his calls.  Thank you, Jeff.  You're welcome.  Hey, do we have the pretenders so we can do this right?  I would love to know what that sounds like.  That is terrible.  I don't know how he does that.  You know, I mean, we kind of know how a radio show works.  You have to be able to hear stuff that's going on, especially with a show like his, political. 
[01:54:00]  You're taking calls.  You're interviewing guests.  Mecca to the Ruck Limbaugh Dome.  Habit and hearing are lost from God.  It's the Ruck Limbaugh Dome.  Today we're going to be talking again about what ad wants the Democrats more.  Bill?  Hello?  Is someone... 
[01:54:30]  Hello?  Hey, Rush.  Hello?  Rush, Rush, am I on the air?  It's the Mav Mimato.  Rush!  Wait, wait, my producer's...  Hand me a note.  Someone is saying what?  Rush!  Oh, hello!  You're on the Mav Mimato.  What do you think of the bombing in Afghanistan thus far?  That!  Rush!  Hello, the Mav Mimato.  You're on the air.  I'm on the Mav Mimato.  What do you think of the bombing in Afghanistan so far?  What? 
[01:55:00]  Okay, not the one.  Forget it.  What do you think about bombing in Afghanistan?  I...  Well, we have to tell people that we don't want to take this anymore.  We can't be here admitting to the people that we bombarded and not be bound with a show of strength from the Republicans.  We are...  Yes, of course I do.  I know exactly what you mean, Koma.  If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. 
[01:55:30]  That's a great question.  Hang up and then dial your operator.  Okay, that's even a better comment.  I agree with you.  That is good stuff.  Yes, absolutely true.  We have to tell that we are strong and that nobody can do this on.  But you know, the Democrats don't understand that we're under the power of power.  What is that?  I'm handing another note. 
[01:56:00]  Beep, beep, beep.  What does that mean?  I said...  Hang...  Hang up the phone.  Hang...  Oh, hang up the phone.  Thank you, Koma.  We'll be back with one.  The Martin Limbaugh doll coming.  I'm on the mind.  And the dear man.  What son of a bitch. 
[01:56:30]  I don't know how he can do it.  Here's our loan from God.  The Rush Limbaugh Show.  Wow.  I wonder if it was even close to that.  Did it get to that?  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  That's the you passed out with your girlfriend on the phone.  And you wake up to go...  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And it's still her talking.  And just when you thought the show couldn't get any worse, Big Kev is back on the line. 
[01:57:00]  Ah.  He gave us Larry Storch a few minutes ago.  And he has another guest ready to go.  Hello.  Big Kev.  Big Kev?  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  I'm here with Bob May.  Bob May, if you remember, we spoke with him once before.  One second, I'll put him on.  It's the guy that was in the robot suit.  Oh.  No, no, don't get carried away.  Who's this?  It's Opie or Anthony?  This is both of us, Bob.  All right.  Bob May.  Hold on, Bob.  We've got to set this up. 
[01:57:30]  Bob May is the guy that was in the robot suit.  Right.  In Lost in Space.  But he wasn't the voice.  Hey, guys.  Yes.  Yes, Bob May.  Talk to me.  Bob May, do you hear us?  Bob?  Bob May.  Bob May.  Back and forth.  Do you hear us, Bob May?  Let me now.  Let me go outside and see if you can hear me now.  Bob May.  You are lost in space.  Do you hear us, Bob? 
[01:58:00]  Hello?  Warning.  Warning, Bob May.  I'm crappy.  Bob May, are you deaf?  What the hell?  Were they dropping it, matey, in the suit while you were in it?  Talk to us, Bob May.  Warning.  Dr. Smith is a pedophile.  Warning.  Oh, dear.  Bob May hung up.  Well, there's our interview with Bob May.  Clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  Wow!  Only the best for our listeners today. 
[01:58:30]  Robot, please hold young William down.  Yes!  Well, there we go.  That was Bob May, not the voice of the robot that we all know from the show.  That's why he couldn't answer.  Just the guy in the suit.  And this time, we don't even get to talk to him.  No.  I look like an effing genius.  Oh, yeah, Rick, you're starting to look a little better now.  This is great.  Well, you know, it's like Battle of Producers today.  Big Kev or Rick?  Who's got us?  Big Kev did get us Kevin Smith.  That's right.  Which is a pretty good find right there. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, Bob May's calling back, Anthony.  Is he?  Yeah, but we have to wait for them to type that Bob May's on the phone before they put him on hold so we can pick him up.  So we'll just wait.  Okay, there we go.  Ah, now I'm ready.  Ah, Mr. May!  No, it's Big Kev.  Hold on, I'm getting him.  Ah, all right.  Let's see.  He's signing an autograph right now.  For who?  I don't know.  For Larry Storch.  He's signing autographs.  Not he's signing autographs.  He's signing a autograph. 
[01:59:30]  Make sure he lets people know it is not me.  Bob.  Bob May.  Bob.  Okay, he's coming.  Hold on.  It must take a while.  Oops, wrong one.  You idiot.  That's not that.  Hoppy?  Bob May.  All right.  Listen, we got cut off before.  I understand.  We had a communication problem, Bob May.  Well, what a...  Smith throwing up.  Warning.  What?  Dr. Smith.  Yes. 
[02:00:00]  He screwed it up just like he screwed up the Jupiter 2.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That is a good one, Bob May.  Mr. May?  Yes, sir.  Did you and Bob Crane stay in touch after the show ended?  The same goddamn question.  Hey, Bob, have you seen Larry Storch down there?  Yeah, who?  What?  Where?  Did you see Larry Storch down there at the signing?  No, I haven't seen Larry.  I know Larry, but I've not seen him.  Well, if you want to...  He's wandering around with a pen in his hand.  And if you want to see what a celebrity looks like, why don't you go find him? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, right.  How are you guys doing?  Bob, we are doing so well since our last interview when you let us all know that you are indeed  not the voice of the robot, but the guy in the suit.  That's right.  The guy in the suit.  Were you ever...  Well, I started out years ago, fellas, on Broadway, so just being part of this show meant so  much to me.  Absolutely.  So you can take it for what you want.  All right.  How tall are you again?  We forgot, Bob. 
[02:01:00]  How tall am I?  5'6".  5'6".  You got to fit in the suit.  Right.  That's what that was all.  You bet you.  You bet you.  Well, the best thing in the world is when I'm locked in that suit, my wife knows where  I am at all times.  Hey, listen, I always look forward to talking to you guys, and it's such a pleasure.  I wish you guys would come down and see us at Schiller's Theater here at Sheridan in  Meadowland, and have some laughs with it, because you're enjoyable, guys. 
[02:01:30]  I wish you so much success on your show.  Yes, thank you, Bob.  Let's ask him a few questions, show our interviewing skills.  All right, go ahead, Opie.  Ask him a question.  Go ahead.  How much did the costume weigh?  350 pounds.  Wow.  Wow.  350 pounds.  Were you ever repulsed by your own fart?  Pardon me?  Were you ever repulsed by your own fart?  No.  Never.  Okay.  That's what the soil sample door is for.  Were you ever locked in the costume? 
[02:02:00]  Yes, I was.  Locked in the costume?  No, I was.  You got locked.  Little Boomy and Mark Goddard locked me in there for lunch one time.  That wacky Mark Goddard.  I always had Mark Goddard pegged as a wacky guy.  Did you also wear the monster suit?  He's a great guy, but he's a good pilot, except for he never learned to land the damn thing.  Well, that's what he named him Crash West.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, any chance you guys come down and visit us?  I'd love to meet you guys in person. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, I'd love to meet you, too.  You're wacky.  Mr. May, what years, I remember Lost in Space from my being molested childhood, what years was it actually on?  65 through 68.  Were you in competition with the Brady Bunch?  I understand that was one of those.  No, we were in competition with Batman, and we were in competition with Star Trek.  And let me tell you, another show that started out in black and white and ended up in color.  Oh, look at you.  Yes, thank you.  The first episodes of Lost in Space, black and white. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, Bob, how bummed are you that if you were a little shorter, you would have been the guy in the R2-D2 suit?  No, let's not get crazy.  That was Billy Barty.  Billy Barty wasn't in the R2-D2 suit?  It wasn't Billy Barty.  We met the guy that was in the R2-D2 suit, my friend.  That's a bitch, I'll tell you.  He had a hard job to do.  He had to lean back.  R2-D2, harder than the robot from Lost in Space?  Not really, no.  No, of course not.  Not really, but it was a different type of job for the guy, and he did a superb job. 
[02:03:30]  Bob, were those your actual arms?  Oh, that's good.  Were they your actual arms in the robot arms?  Pardon me?  Yes.  Oh, they were?  My arms were inside the arms of the robot, yes.  So when they waved around, that was you?  Yes, sir, it was.  Warning, warning.  Danger, danger, Will Robinson.  No, you can't do it.  No, you're not the guy.  That's right.  Mr. May, was it like common knowledge back then that, you know, Mike Brady was losing 
[02:04:00]  weight rapidly in real life?  Let me put it, it was easy enough to keep.  No, no, it's a good question because I did maintain my weight because you'd sweat like  a pig in that sucker.  No, sir, not you.  No, my apologies, Mr. May.  Bob, it's not always about you.  You're not clarifying.  Yeah, sometimes it's about the whole time, you know, the 60s and stuff.  You ever turn that big thing into a big bong and just fill it up with pot smoke? 
[02:04:30]  Oh-oh!  Do you ever bring girls in the city with you?  Hey, I still say, fellas, I still say, come down and see us at Schiller because you'll  love the show.  There's some great stars down here.  You love to see them, and they'd love to see you.  I've always enjoyed it.  Time to play a silent game.  I wanted to do your show when I came in a town.  Silent game.  Bob, what was that?  I said, I enjoyed doing your show.  I enjoyed it the last time. 
[02:05:00]  I enjoy having fun, fellas, and you bring across fun, and that's what it's all about.  So, come on down and see us down here at Schiller in the Meadowland at the Sheraton Hotel.  You'll have some fun.  You'll meet a lot of great people.  I've got to get back to my table.  There's fans running all over the place.  So, take care, and the very best of you guys.  There, how was that?  There's a dual-person silent game. 
[02:05:30]  There's plenty of fans running around.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Both of them.  Both of them.  Larry Storch.  Larry Storch running around looking for a diaper.  Oh, my God.  All right.  He's got a pretty good sense of humor.  He likes Norton's questions.  Wow.  Stoner Sean. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Larry Storch poops his pants.  That's not the real Stoner Sean.  We can tell.  All right.  We better take a break here.  All right.  Jerry, what's going on?  Jerry, hello.  I just want to tell you guys are killing me down here with these interviews, man.  They're great, right?  Get the Stoner on there some more, too.  All right.  Cool.  But we love you down here in D.C., y'all.  Coming soon, man.  Details coming.  I've got to plug the trade aid benefit.  Yes, Adam Farrar, please.  Hammerstein Ballroom, November 5th.  It's to benefit the children who lost parents in the September 11th disaster. 
[02:06:30]  Riddled with stars, you can get tickets at Smart Tickets, 212-206-1515.  All right.  And with that, we'll take a break, and we'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail for the kings of the radio.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die. 
[02:07:00]  Cepro may not be holistic, taking extra doses.  But it's the only drug that kills the anthrax in your nose.  It's bin Laden and his kooky gang.  Our cow had crazy iconic.  For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, we all eat an ibionic.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Open up your mail and we're all going to die.  Hey!  The junk mail you've been getting could be from the Taliban.  I'll never enter sweepstakes that I get from Ed McMahon.  This anthrax scare has made us all a bunch of nervous wrecks. 
[02:07:30]  Just wear your gloves and mask when you get letters from FedEx.  Hey!  Spending anthrax in our mail will never be forgotten.  Now come Blue Cross, you need to struggle and fill it to Bin Laden.  Cepro may not be holistic, but we must be cautious.  It kills those nasty spores so that you won't feel so damn nauseous.  Cepro kills those spores so that you won't feel so damn nauseous.  Hey, John, what's going on today?  It's Open Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  I was wondering if you could do the impression of the auction guy on TV selling Cepro. 
[02:08:00]  I think that'd be great to hear.  What the hell was his name again?  Dan West!  Where the hell did he end up?  He got fired.  Did he get fired or quit and think he was going to go on to something better?  I think he got fired.  There's a guy who had a great gig.  You've seen him.  It's 2.30 in the morning, 3 in the morning.  You flip through the channels.  There's Don West selling his baseball carts.  My baseball carts. 
[02:08:30]  Look at the deal we got for you right now.  Look at this deal.  You can open up your own goddamn card store.  Open it up.  Give me three minutes on the clock.  Three minutes left to get this deal.  And he'd start screaming until the three minutes ran out.  And then he'd say, if you bought that last batch, you were an ass.  Because the one we're bringing out now puts that to shame.  You wasted your money.  But if you're watching now, this is when you got to buy. 
[02:09:00]  We got Cipro.  We got Cipro.  Everyone heard of the anthrax.  We're all hearing about anthrax.  You open up your mail, you're going to get the anthrax.  Where are you getting the Cipro?  You can get it here from me, Dan West.  And we send it in a social rookie card.  Open up your own pharmacy with this deal.  We're getting an open up your own pharmacy deal.  You get the Cipro, and we throw in the AZT if you got the hip. 
[02:09:30]  You can snort your mail and have anal without a worry.  No worries.  No worries.  No worries.  Look at me.  Okay.  What?  I'll open this up.  I'm pouring out anthrax spores.  All right.  I just snorted anthrax spores, anthrax spores, anthrax spores. 
[02:10:00]  Snorted them right out.  This could mean certain death unless I had, here it is, my Cipro.  Look, I got my Cipro.  And you can, too.  Open up your own pharmacy.  Open up your own pharmacy.  Be dialing, people.  Give me three minutes on the clock.  What do you mean we don't have any Cipro left here?  Look, I just snorted anthrax.  We sold it all, Don.  I snorted anthrax.  You did such a great job. 
[02:10:30]  We sold all the Cipro, though, Don.  Look, I'm not feeling very good.  And I had anal with a gay Haitian.  Where's my AZT?  Where's my AZT?  Where's my...  Well, Don, you all right?  I'm feeling pretty bad.  I thought we had some in stock.  People, stop dialing.  Stop dialing.  If you did receive some of our Cipro, could you mail it back to Don West, care of Home Shopping Network? 
[02:11:00]  What the hell is this on my hand?  Oh, God.  It's festering.  I knew...  You know something?  I knew we shouldn't have done this.  I could sell it without having to snort the anthrax.  People, please be giving me back the Cipro.  Ow.  And we'll send you a Ben Laden rookie card.  When he was just a little terrorist. 
[02:11:30]  Who knew he was going to be this big?  Get in on the bottom floor.  Be dialing now.  We'll let you sponsor a bomb.  Get your Cipro.  Get your AZT.  Sponsor a bomb.  Sponsor a bomb.  Sponsor...  Don, you all right?  I'm feeling pretty bad.  I think it went right into my lungs.  What happens when anthrax gets in your lungs?  I could be okay, right?  Uh.  Uh. 
[02:12:00]  Uh.  There you go, you ass.  Thank you, Don West.  It hurts my throat in real life.  Don't make me do it no more.  Or I can't do the little kid with the progeria.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether the studio and listen to you guys  have to drive down there and pass your heads in with a baseball bat. 
[02:12:30]  And this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  I must say, one of our better shows.  Probably the best show of the week, Anthony.  I would think so.  At least, I would call it the last show of the week.  That's good.  Mistress Rhiannon's going to come in here in a minute.  Great.  She has the blow-up boobs that she does?  Yeah.  Did we get our pictures done for the boobalander contest, Rick?  Pictures are done.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  Did you use landing lights from a 767 to light up those breasts?  I used the pin spots.  They used the spot King Kong on the Empire Statement.  Good.  You need those bright lights.  West Coast Dave checking in to bust our balls.  Hey, guys.  This is an impressively bad show.  As long as it's impressively bad.  You know what, though?  It's been a long time since you had a stinker like this.  Even the Yankees go out there and lose 12 to 3 every now and then.  Hey.  Screw you.  Come on, Dave. 
[02:13:30]  No, we can't do that today.  No, no, no.  How you doing?  How you doing, Yankees?  How you doing?  And just when you thought this show couldn't be any worse.  Yeah.  Big Kev is calling back.  Where's Big Kev?  Get him on the phone.  He's getting us a lot of guests today.  Who have we interviewed so far today?  My God.  The likes of Larry Storch from F Troop.  Right.  We've spoken to Bob May, who is the guy inside the suit, the robot suit in Lost in Space.  And now, if I'm reading this correctly, I'm thrilled to death right now to let everyone 
[02:14:00]  know that Melanie Patterson, Wrangler Jane from F Troop, that hot piece of ass from  the show, that hot piece of ass.  I was just looking at her pictures on the website.  Who are we kidding?  I can't believe we've got to talk to this old broad.  Hey.  Jesus Christ.  They're on hold.  I sure hold.  Big Kev is on.  Big Kev.  Hey, what's up? 
[02:14:30]  Big Kev, how you doing out there?  It's windy and cold.  You got the battle axe ready?  Wait, you're bringing our guests outside to talk to us?  No, they're actually in a tent outside of the hotel.  They don't even rain enough to be inside the hotel.  Are they going to start pumping in the Zyklon B?  Are you ready for Melody Patterson?  Who wouldn't be ready?  Okay, hold on. 
[02:15:00]  Hello.  Can you hear me?  Melanie Patterson.  Yeah?  How are you?  Oh, I'm a little chilly out here right now, but I'm just fine.  You know, I was just looking at your website.  I hope it's your website.  Yeah, it's my website.  WranglerJane.com.  That's it.  And the pictures of you on there are stunning.  Well, thank you.  Let me tell you.  Thank you very much.  I grew up watching F Troop.  And you, as WranglerJane, boy, I think you got a lot of young boys to have some of their 
[02:15:30]  first life experiences, let's say.  So, I'm called WranglerJane.  I've dedicated about 30 gallons to you, girls.  Oh, my God.  Jim, no.  Oh, my God.  I have a towel in my room I can use as a lamp stand.  Oh, for God's sake.  But, Melanie, I have to apologize for some of the people here in the studio with me that  don't know how to talk to a lady.  Hey, Jane, that time could be a bitch, huh?  You're talking about eight. 
[02:16:00]  I think.  Okay, wait a minute.  Hey, what happened?  I got to.  What happened?  Why is everyone leaving?  I thought we were going to toast marshmallows.  What happened?  I thought we were having fun.  Okay, I'll be.  You handle this.  Where are you guys anyway?  Where are we?  We are in New York City.  Oh, okay.  Beautiful New York.  And you are at.  Why don't you tell everyone where they can come down?  I mean, it's rough for anybody who's around this area to come on down for the next three  days.  We got. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Hello.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  WranglerJane.  Hello.  There's a problem in the tent.  I hope Big Kev didn't eat her.  Hello.  Oh, for you.  Oh, man.  Probably the most despicable human being.  Yeah, there it goes.  Yeah, but she didn't have.  I guess the cell phone screwed up.  All right.  Well, I'm sure Big Kev will get her back.  I'm all right.  No.  Kev, if you're listening, please don't call back with her.  No, I actually have a valid question.  I actually do have a valid question.  Yeah, I need to.  Oh, jeez.  I do.  Real questions. 
[02:17:00]  By the way, you could start sending in What Did You Learn?  Oh, my God.  So, we could go through them.  It's awful.  So, maybe that segment will be a little better today.  You are terrible.  Why did I?  I didn't even say anything.  That time is a bitch.  Well?  Have you seen Nova from the Planet of the Apes movie?  Nova.  You look like Dr. Zayas now.  Big wrinkly face.  Hey, can I say something?  I went on to Melanie Patterson if she called back. 
[02:17:30]  I went and saw From Hell last night.  The new Johnny Depp.  From Hell, the Johnny Depp movie.  Now, I haven't seen it yet, but I just want a little info because I heard it was bad.  Yeah, it's a movie, what, based on Jack the Ripper.  Jack the Ripper.  Yeah, the cinematography was really good, but I didn't like the movie yet.  You didn't like it?  What a surprise.  Why?  Huh?  What a surprise.  Why didn't you like it?  I just didn't like the movie.  I know Heather Graham's hot.  Heather Graham, very hot, bad actor.  She is not the best actress. 
[02:18:00]  No.  I liked her as Roller Girl in the Boogie Nights.  That was nice.  I mean, they didn't fool me.  It was obvious she wasn't dead at the end of the movie.  All right, look, look, look, look, look.  You are a scumbag.  I...  What?  You know, I didn't see the goddamn thing.  What?  Not only that, I wind up taking the brunt of this abuse because I read the instant feedback  on the screen as it comes in.  And people ruined movies for me. 
[02:18:30]  I just want to say they wanted us to think that she was dead at the end of the movie.  It was obvious to me that, you know, they were pulling one, a fast one.  A little fast one on us.  And that she was alive and well in the countryside with the prince's kid.  Oh, my God.  But I was definitely surprised when Johnny Depp died at the end of the movie.  Did he die at the end?  Yeah.  You.  Look, look.  Stop it.  I love it.  Keep going.  Look, no way.  I'm not even going to believe that.  A lot of people thought he might have kept going at the end of the film. 
[02:19:00]  I really thought Johnny Depp would join her in the country to raise the kid.  Next thing you know, he's in the drug den.  His partner there checks on him and he's dead.  Puts the coins over his eye.  Because that's what they did in the old days.  Wow.  Right?  That's how it went.  Sort of.  Don't look at me.  Hell, man.  If I had to be miserable last night and watch that movie, everyone else out there should be miserable today.  Jesus, so.  You suck. 
[02:19:30]  But people really don't know who Jack the Ripper was, right?  So what's the use of making a film about him?  You don't know if it's accurate or not.  Well, now you know the end, whether you saw it or not.  Hey, why isn't Wrangler James calling back?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, stop it.  Could we get Big Kev on the line?  No.  You know.  This time is a bitch.  Time is a bitch.  Why didn't you say that your breasts probably look like golf balls at the end of pantyhose by now, don't they? 
[02:20:00]  I was leading up to that, but you didn't hear the first one.  I kind of wanted to speak with her a little bit.  Growing up, watching her.  Oh!  Is that Big Kev calling back?  Oh, we're trying to get a hold of Big Kev?  Oh, no.  Let's invite Mistress Rhiannon in here in the meantime.  Yeah, you're all warmed up.  Jesus Christ.  What?  She's in the boobalander.  I said, cool.  Cool.  I wish she could stand next to me.  Oh, brother.  All right.  She can stand next to you from across the room. 
[02:20:30]  And let's invite her in.  This one's a freaking horror.  Wow.  Nice.  Oh, there it is.  Hot.  There.  Yeah.  Hey, let me tell you.  Wow.  In a Jack the Ripper sort of way.  But I was downstairs getting frisked by your security people.  Oh, really?  I took about 20 minutes to get up here.  Why is that?  Well, it was so tight.  They were all over me.  Yeah.  It's obvious she's so hot they had a frisker, Anthony.  Look, guys.  I am here to defend my title.  Of?  Y'all came up with that title, Boobalander for me. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Did we get her Boobalander pictures?  Absolutely.  But I have, I'm 50% disabled, I guess, disabled, right?  What happened?  She pulled a boob.  You had a blowout?  I had a mechanical malfunction.  The valve was not closed.  An anomaly?  After the fills, yes.  The valve was not closed.  Not closing.  What it was going in was coming out.  All right, hold on.  It was like having sex and standing up straight.  All right, hold on, hold on.  You're a real mistress, aren't you?  I am. 
[02:21:30]  All right, hold on.  Whoa, why do you the pictures?  Hold on, hold on.  Everyone, hold on.  We've got to set the table here.  Mistress Rhiannon's pictures are up on opianthony.com.  Oh, my God.  What the hell happened to your right boob?  I told you.  You're leaking up into your throat area.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's because my pocket is really big now.  It's cut way apart.  So when I feel the breast, I have a lot of room to a span.  Oh, usually when I look at breasts, I get really turned on.  What's going on to you?  Wow, look at that.  It's like...  I wasn't supposed to come out yet.  What?  You see, I have the incision here.  Holy Toledo. 
[02:22:00]  Rick, get a picture of the incision.  It's my first day out of bed just to come and see you all so I can defend my title.  Wait a minute.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to freaking...  They lapped it open like a honeydew melon and then took the...  What did they do when they went in?  Well, they took out the old implant.  They took out the old bag.  And they revised the pocket.  Revised the pocket.  So they took us pretty much what amounts to a spade shovel and dug out the inside.  And then replaced...  So eloquently pushed.  Yeah.  And then replaced... 
[02:22:30]  With a new implant.  With a new...  The same thing, the double back.  Implant.  Does it still have the valve?  Of course, honey.  It's horrible, but...  Where's the valve?  Can you see?  Oh!  Bobby!  Wow.  I'm getting that tingly feeling of, like, pain.  No idea?  I was nauseous for two days throwing up.  Can you make them smaller, too?  Well, we got something in common.  Only to the size of the inner lumen.  How big is that?  And the inner lumen is 1,800.  1,800.  What are they at now? 
[02:23:00]  Well, this side is 30.  Sell!  Sell!  3,600.  And this size is only 24.  You have an ad in Steppin' Out, don't you?  I do.  I almost called it one night.  Did you see your little stuff?  No, I just saw the ad.  I'm the cover girl of Cleavage Dreams, Napoli Videos.  And I just have a pictorial now in Gents.  They just came out, in fact, two days ago.  Cleavage Dreams, huh?  Oh, my.  You like that, huh?  Cleavage Nightmares, maybe.  I should have taken off these.  It's really nasty, right?  Hey, it's...  Wow. 
[02:23:30]  Here's my...  You've got a Franken-boob there.  What possessed you?  I do.  Is it going to heal okay?  Of course.  Well, I hope.  Actually, I should be laying down flat.  It's you all that I'm in here.  If I don't heal, I'm going to blame you two guys.  I hope it doesn't just fall out the bottom there.  And taking the pressure off.  My doctor will kill me if he knows I'm in here.  The rest of you is very slender.  Thank you.  You're very kind.  Nice.  I appreciate that.  Oh, my God.  Jim, feel her boob.  Go ahead, Jim.  Feel her boob.  You want to touch one?  Yes, I do.  That's my...  Yeah, that's my...  Whoa, you might pop it.  It's actually like a decent one. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, sorry.  Wow, man.  Don't hit the valve.  How heavy is that, Norton?  Really nice.  You like it?  Yeah, I like it.  Oh, look at him.  Yeah.  There's more.  Come back, but listen.  Don't touch the incision, but feel how nice this is because all the scar tissue is removed.  Right?  Nice.  You like that?  It feels like a real boob, huh?  Well, I was getting hot when you were just saying scar tissue removed.  That is something.  It was like a demo job, right?  So, that one busted or something, so they redid it. 
[02:24:30]  Now, could that get bigger?  I had a mechanical malfunction.  Are they going to do the other one now?  No, sweetie.  Oh, I thought maybe they would...  No, because it's the same bag, so they kept me with the same implant.  Hey, can I interrupt your segment for a second?  Absolutely.  Because Big Kev is calling back here.  All right.  Hey, Big Kev.  Hey.  Hey.  What happened to Wrangler Jane?  I don't know.  The phone crapped out.  Well, we were enjoying the interview with Wrangler Jane.  Can we get her back on the line?  I'm sorry.  I got Joe Pants here. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think you finally stumped all of us.  Joe Pantaleone.  Joe Pants.  Joe Pantaleone.  Yeah, Joe Pantaleone.  Oh.  Well, there you go.  From The Sopranos?  Of course.  Put him on.  All right.  Hold on a sec.  I want to talk to Wrangler Jane.  Joe?  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joey.  Hey, Joe. 
[02:25:30]  Joe.  Joe.  She was a hoo-er.  Joe?  Joe.  Joe.  She was a hoo-er.  Joe.  Wait, this is Guido the Killer Pit?  Of course.  Oh, rock.  That we're not talking to because Big Kev's phone sucks.  There goes Big Kev.  Ah, Big Kev's phone.  There's our interview with Guido the Killer Pimp.  I think we got hello.  I want to address the problem I had with him after the UFner roast.  Okay.  Well, the guy totally blew me off.  Can we get back to Mr. Reyes?  I'm talking to everyone else upstairs. 
[02:26:00]  I go up to Joe.  I'm like, Joe, how you doing?  Great fan of the show and everything.  Yeah, thanks.  And just turns around.  It's like, like, F you.  You're not insulting Mrs. Rhiannon, are you?  She was a hoo-er.  No?  No.  Okay, hold on a second.  It takes a lot to insult me.  Trust me.  Well, give us time.  Big Kev.  Okay, I think we got him this time.  All right.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  Joe.  I loved you in, uh, with Andy Griffith.  I loved you in, uh, that Risky Business movie. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  I liked them in Goonies.  Goonies?  I liked them in the Risky Business.  Hey, Joe, what the hell are you doing there?  I'm here with Bob Picardo.  I'm having a blast.  Oh, yeah?  What's Bob doing?  He's an old friend.  He came in for the weekend.  Oh, so you're hanging out with friends.  All right.  I thought...  He's putting words in my mouth.  Who is he?  I know.  Tell him to shut up.  He said you should shut up. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Hey, Joe, I was at the, uh, I was at the U Hefner Roast there.  What?  I was at that U Hefner Roast.  Oh, really?  And then I went to the...  Wasn't that girl that was sitting next to beautiful?  That was...  She was very pretty.  And actually, that dress in the kitchen, you could feel a lot more with the bright fluorescent.  I bet.  Now, Joe...  Oh, beautiful girl.  There's just something I got to ask you, Joe.  Yes, sir.  The after party?  You know...  I didn't go to the after party.  No, you went to the after party. 
[02:27:30]  You were upstairs at that bar.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, we went to another party, and then we went to the after party.  Yeah.  Joe, I went up to say hi to you.  I appreciate it.  You know, the work that you've done.  You blew me off.  You were the biggest scumbag I ever met.  It was probably the way you did it.  No, I know how to approach people.  I was very cordial, and I said that to you, and now I'm talking to you, so...  And you were a scumbag to me, Joe.  Well, you know, what can I tell you? 
[02:28:00]  You treated me like a hooah.  Like I was a hooah.  You treated us like hooahs.  I only treated you, Chip, like a hooah.  All right, Joey.  Hey, Joe?  Yes, sir?  Are they going to be bringing Bob Crane back next season?  Shut up with your Bob Crane.  Bob Crane was between me and Bob for the role of Droughty.  Very good.  I can't wait for the new season of Sopranos.  Okay, well, you'll have to.  September 2000.  Because even though you're a pain in the ass to me, I enjoy your work there, Joey. 
[02:28:30]  Thank you very much.  Nice talking to you guys.  Hey, can we get that big guy back on the phone?  Okay, here you go.  All right.  Guido, the killer.  Hello?  I'm glad I was able to call him a scumbag.  Twice.  Pretty brave man.  Big Kev.  Hello?  I know.  Big Kev.  Hi.  Hey, what's up, Kev?  Can we get Wrangler Jane back on the phone?  No, no.  Yeah.  I could try.  No.  We were enjoying our time with her.  Did you hear what Opie said to her?  No, I didn't. 
[02:29:00]  He goes, that time's a bitch, huh?  Yeah, exactly.  That's awful.  I'm still working on a few more people.  We want Wrangler Jane.  Okay, I'll get her.  I'll put her right back.  All right, cool.  There goes Big Kev getting us all the big stars of today.  All right, Mistress Rihanna, back to you.  I'm sorry.  Why, thank you very much.  So you got your surgery done and you're back.  Yes, one week ago.  You're on the road to recovery?  I'm hoping so.  Yeah.  I'm on the road anyway for y'all.  So I should be laying flat, taking the pressure off, like I said before. 
[02:29:30]  Ah, so no T-F-ing, huh?  Rick is tough, man.  Did the doctor tell you no T-F-ing for a while?  Yeah, absolutely not.  Yeah.  I'll have to wait a good four weeks.  How do you feel about administering, like, Yellow Discipline onto a fella?  Oh.  We've seen her do it.  Oh, really?  We've seen her do it.  She did it at one of our road shows.  She did it at a road show.  I can't say in a way, you guys.  It was a friend of my brother-in-law, Johnny Race.  Yeah, one of his friends, PJ, lays down in a bucket of ice that was there for beer. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  And she administered the Yellow Discipline.  A little GSM.  And it was...  It was a lot.  Yeah, it was Never Ending Cascade.  Well, you guys, no one would tell me where the facilities were.  Well, they were PJ.  And, you know, when a girl's got to go, she's got to go.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm looking at your boob-o-lantern picture.  Yes, we did.  Why didn't the right one light up?  I think it's because it's not stretched out because I have so much room in the pocket right now.  Looks like an eclipse.  There's no pressure on there.  Yeah, okay.  How does it look, though?  Good, though? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, you can check it out.  The left one looks great.  Of course.  I am the boob-o-o-lantern girl.  And that other chick that didn't show up, she's totally disqualified, in my opinion.  It looks like a sonogram.  Hey, I want to see that one of those two.  A newborn baby bird's skull.  All red and stuff, right?  Hey, Wrangler Jane's back, everyone.  Hi.  All right, let's continue our interview with this old broad.  No.  Hello?  Wrangler...  Oh, thank God.  Big Kev's on the phone.  It's Wrangler Kev.  Kev.  Yeah.  You have Wrangler Jane again? 
[02:31:00]  Yes, right in front of me.  Okay.  Hope he wants to speak to her.  All right, hold on.  I am out of this.  Hope he wants to speak to her.  Hello?  I'm not saying a word.  You know, you might be able to hear me, but I can't hear you.  Thank God.  Oh, hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Hello?  You know, and I can't believe we're talking so hard again.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.  We'll get it. 
[02:31:30]  Hello?  Hello?  This is so painful.  Hello?  I don't want to deal with this.  Hello?  Norton's thumbing through nude pictures.  Let us know when you're done, Ope.  Oh, you're awful.  All right, well, they're gone.  So that was...  Horrid man.  That was Wrangler Jane.  Nice.  Okay.  Horrid man.  So what else you got, Mr. Sriadden, for us?  Well, I brought you my latest video.  Okay.  Cleavage Dreams.  Nice.  What do you do in these videos? 
[02:32:00]  Do you F and stuff?  No, no, no.  This is like erotica.  This is strictly like...  Erotica.  You know, you're by yourself and you're adoring your breasts and...  Oh, are you...  Catching them?  Oh, right.  Catching them.  Right.  You're taking care of yourself in this video.  Well, wait a minute.  In this picture, who's the guy in the cage?  Full service.  Oh, that photograph.  That's from which magazine was that?  I think it's Boot Camp.  Oh, Boot Camp.  The one where she's dressed like a Nazi SS soldier.  The frontline one.  I was going to come into my army fatigues today, but I chose differently.  That's just one of my submissives. 
[02:32:30]  He's having a little corporal discipline and B&D.  Okay.  Bondage and discipline.  Is that a light being spanked or tied up or any of that stuff?  Say hello.  Hello?  What is your fetish?  Hello?  My face resembles a chair.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Are you there?  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Hello?  No?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  He's going hello.  I'm going hello.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Put her back on. 
[02:33:00]  They're gone again.  Okay.  Let's get her to sing Mercedes Benz.  And Mistress Rhiannon has a website that's really good.  And she works with props.  Look at this.  What has she got?  Let me see.  Spin that around now.  Look at that.  That's not hers.  I did that photo shoot in an adult bookstore up in Benville.  You don't accept that, do you?  Do I accept that?  Well, I don't think she denounces it.  Do you accept that?  Well, you know what I mean.  I'm trying to use proper terminology.  It is about the size of a jackhammer.  I'm a small girl. 
[02:33:30]  I don't think so.  Oh, really?  Looks nice, though, right?  Looks pretty good.  So you're into, like, you're a dominatrix.  Absolutely.  So you pound the guys, smack them around a bit like that, and then never let them actually  show their appreciation.  Right.  No, they do, right?  At the end, if they've been a good boy, yes, I let them hand-release themselves.  Oh, gee, thanks.  I say, you can now entertain me.  If they're good.  Oh, and then?  And then I let them eat it up.  Oh, gee, that's an e-ticket attraction. 
[02:34:00]  Wow, you've got to be this tall to ride.  What the?  So, that's a special breed of guy.  Mm-hmm.  I guess that appreciates doing that.  I've got to ask this carefully.  What happened to the lips thing?  Why, what did I do?  Did I smear my lipstick?  No, they're, like, really big.  Oh, this is great lipstick, isn't it?  Is it injections, though, or what?  I have, actually, I have silicone in my lips.  Wow.  I did that in Texas about five years ago. 
[02:34:30]  Is it like the implants, or is it a...  It's actually like a silicone oil, and they inject it with a needle.  And does it go away, and you have to have it recharged every so often?  No, actually, it's the only permanent injection.  Really?  Injectable.  Is it numb or anything?  Absolutely not.  Very kissable.  Nice.  Oh, there you go.  Lips and boobs.  That doesn't match.  That's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Lips and you fill in the blank.  Okay.  All right, well, we got her pictures done for the Boobalander contest.  They look great. 
[02:35:00]  They're up on opianity.com.  I didn't get to see my site, too.  We're getting into that before, and I stopped.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you give out the website, please?  I have RhiannonXX, that's R-H-I-A-N-N-O-N-X-X-X.com, and MistressRiannon.com.  That's Mistress, and that's R-H-I-A-N-N-O-N.com.  Very good.  And she can spell.  All right.  Well, thank you very much.  Good girl.  We're going to take a break.  The guy that got kicked off, Survivor, last night, he's hanging out.  We'll play What Do We Learn? 
[02:35:30]  Mistress Rhiannon's hanging out.  You bet.  And Wrangler Jane calling.  No, but she's not going to call.  Hello.  You're awful.  Hello.  Hello.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, this is Robert England here, a.k.a.  Freddy Krueger, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  And I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show, theater of the mindless. 
[02:36:00]  Wow, not much time left in this train wreck.  Choo, choo.  Monday and Tuesday, don't forget, we'll be broadcasting live from WBCN in Boston for the  Gray Braves.  I can't wait for that.  And we'll continue the Boob-O-Lantern contest with all the local girls in the Boston area.  If you have the breast implants, just show up while we're broadcasting, and we'll take  care of the rest.  If you need the rules, or if you need to know what it's about, go to opieandanthony.com. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  Mistress Rhiannon's pictures are up there.  Wow.  We've got to get Dr. Carl in here for a minute.  He got kicked off Survivor last night.  Anthony, what did we learn on the ONA show?  I learned Adam Farrar doesn't get an intro anymore.  Yeah.  He barely said anything.  Of course.  Dr. Carl, how are you?  I don't know.  What are my followers?  There he is.  I don't think I can survive your waiting room. 
[02:37:00]  See what happened out there?  I thought my waiting room was bad.  I'm going back to Africa, guys.  Yeah.  You're a doctor?  What kind of doctor?  I'm a dentist.  Oh, well.  Yeah, I know.  Not a real doctor.  Okay, that's what I mean.  Is your real name Alan Sniffen?  You're not Alan Sniffen.  Are you a radio dentist?  No.  Radio dentist?  A little inside thing here in New York.  A little inside New York audience.  Yeah.  A little outside New York audience.  There's a lot outside over there, guys.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, there's stuff going on out there, huh?  You see that?  I was afraid I was going to get knocked over.  Well, get her in here, because she was going to make her boobs bigger in front of our eyes.  Stop it.  She's mixing up the... 
[02:37:30]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  She's going to make them bigger?  Yeah, she has, like, these things that she puts under her armpit, and it's a valve.  I guess I'm not supposed to say that.  Sorry about it.  Oh, my God.  It's not like I haven't been on the radio before.  You know something?  Jeff Probst might like that potty mouth out of you, but, you know, we don't stand for that here.  Come on.  Give me a break.  We have the Sam Adams, buddy.  What's going on with the potty mouth?  Exactly.  Jesse says hello, by the way.  Jesse.  Oh, yeah.  Jesse, come on.  Oh, the hot one.  Come on.  Hey, I'm good friends with Jesse. 
[02:38:00]  Let me tell you something.  I watched the last half hour of Survivor last night because I got home late.  Right.  So I missed the whole show, basically.  And you guys were at the bonfire there.  What is it called?  The tribal council?  The tribal council.  You got confused.  You were thinking of...  Temptation Island.  Temptation Island.  Yeah, that's when we got to watch.  You guys were at Submissile Hill.  Dismissile Hill.  Dismissile Hill.  Whatever they call it.  Looza Hill.  And it was...  You were up against a real hot blonde, and I got to say, 
[02:38:30]  I was hoping you were going to get kicked out.  Oh.  Do you think she's hot?  Yeah, she looked pretty hot last night.  Were you drinking last night?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know what?  I'm going to give you the tape so you can replay that.  Yeah, but see, you know, I mean, you had a smell for a few weeks in Africa,  but on TV she looked pretty hot.  Really?  Really?  I'm shocked.  Yeah, I thought she had something going on with that little cowboy hat and stuff.  Giddy up, right?  Giddy up, right.  Why do you think you got the boot?  What happened?  What went wrong?  Oh, it was obvious what happened.  A, Silas thinks that he can win it all on, you know, his sure physical strength 
[02:39:00]  and good looks and all-American boy.  He realized the four of us were pretty well tight.  You know, Frank, the military guy, Linda, and Teresa.  And I made him an offer.  I thought he couldn't refuse.  I said, take a look at the tribe.  Whoever is weak is the one we need to get rid of.  Brandon, give me a break.  He's not pulling his weight there.  Right.  I said, we go in strong as a team, we win the challenges, we go into the merge, who's  going to stop us?  See, now you seemed like a Budinsky, so they just threw you out.  No, because he approached us first.  Really? 
[02:39:30]  And then I laid out the game plan.  It seems to me if someone plans a little too much or tries to take, like, control a  little too early, they'll say, you know, something, get the...  No, and then also, you know, he's had to paint me as the rich dentist, but his father's  an oral surgeon.  Yeah, they said he doesn't need the money, so that's why...  Oh, really?  To get out of there.  I believe, really, they thought I was a threat, you know, for them.  And, you know, they voted me out.  Yankee fan, Ant.  Big Yankee fan.  There you go.  Nice.  Wore the Yankee cap last night.  And I have it here with me, the one that I wore on Survivor.  Oh, can I touch it? 
[02:40:00]  You've been touching other things.  You don't want to touch that hat.  It's a little smelt from happening.  Here's Mrs. Rihanna.  She's going to blow up her boobs, even.  She's ready?  Can we see the...  Apparatus.  The mixture thing.  It's a syringe.  She's got it right here.  I don't want to watch this.  Why?  Oh, my God.  You got, like, a saline bag, like they were just using the hospital there.  Get a picture.  Can we get pictures of this?  Sure you can.  All right.  Wow.  Aren't you afraid of infection?  Dr. Carl, you're going to have to come back when we have more time.  We have, like...  I know.  I've been stuck with you today. 
[02:40:30]  Can I get a picture?  I got my camera.  Yeah, you can take pictures of this.  Look, he's running at his camera.  This is better than Africa.  This is better than Africa.  Is he going to be, like, now, the survivor dentist?  Where, like, his office has, I'm the survivor dentist.  Right.  You know, kind of use it as a...  A little music playing when you walk in.  Yeah.  As Mr. Serrano gets ready really fast, a few...  What did we learn?  Yeah.  Jameek from Brooklyn.  I learned a few things.  Opie's fake laugh, always funny.  Compared to Larry Storch, Robert Reed got off easy. 
[02:41:00]  Anthony's mom is a goer, but the porn stars weren't.  Al Mack.  Today, I learned Brother Joe led a conga line wearing sunglasses and playing a fake guitar at his wedding.  Thank you.  Staten Island Vin, I learned that when you're just too gay for no doubt, there's always Madonna.  Danielle from Alabama, syndication underground.  I learned that you guys went from 40th to 3rd in San Francisco today.  Norton Rolls.  Al Mack.  Today, I learned that getting oral from a trainee is not as gay as going to a pumpkin carving party.  And Beavis writes, today, I learned opening mail with your nose is more fun than a pumpkin carving costume party extravaganza. 
[02:41:30]  Extravaganza.  Okay.  Oh, my goodness.  What now are we going to actually see?  But I want Norton to hold on to my boob while it gets filled so he can feel the difference.  James, you don't have anthrax under that arm over there, do you?  No, that's my new surgery from my new port.  Okay, I just want to make sure.  But wait a second.  I am ready for that stuff.  What?  Oh, she's ready for anthrax?  What is she doing?  She's got a gas mask.  I have my gas mask and my Cifro. 
[02:42:00]  I'm ready.  Yeah, but you had that before all this started, didn't you?  No, I did, actually.  Yes.  You're bad.  He knows me too well.  Because if there was a little cataclysmic event that wiped out most of the population of the country,  thank God you would still be walking around showing people giant breasts.  Hey, what happened to Dr. Carl?  Well, we have Dr. Fury here instead.  He's going to fill my breast for you, guys.  Oh, my God.  I can't lie.  He's got a 666 Satan Club shirt on.  Now there are no...  He's got a Club Satan shirt on and he's a doctor, Ant. 
[02:42:30]  No misconceptions of how this is done.  Yeah.  Okay?  So when you all talk about me, you say it right.  And explain this very fast because we're going off the air.  She has a port under her armpit.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Okay.  The doctor is not a guy.  He's looking for the port right now.  And then he sticks a needle in it.  And with a huge syringe.  He sticks a needle.  With a huge syringe.  Look.  Got the port.  The syringe is stuck under her armpit.  Jimmy, grab that.  Grab that.  You've got to look at the...  And now he's pumping fluid in... 
[02:43:00]  Oh, my God.  Is it working?  This is...  Why isn't it coming out there?  Oh, it's coming out.  It is?  Do you feel it going through your body?  I do feel it.  There's tension on the skin.  Norton, do you feel anything as it...  There's tension in my pants.  Goes in.  Oh, my God.  It'll get heavier.  It'll get heavier.  How much are you putting in today there, Mistress Rihanna?  Well, since we're running out of time, only 60 cc's.  Which is not a whole lot.  Oh, my Jesus.  I mean, considering the bag goes to 4,000.  Look at Dr. Carl taking pictures.  4,500. 
[02:43:30]  Get on the other side so he's...  You can...  It goes to 4,500.  That's correct.  All right, sir.  Look at that.  It's almost...  We're taking pictures and we're going to put them up on opianthony.com.  Hey, what keeps it from leaking out the top after you pull the needle back out?  The gasket in there?  It actually is a valve.  It turns off automatically.  And that's what happened to the right side.  It wasn't shutting off.  Oh, so it was just leaking out of your armpit.  And I thought Survivor Africa was tough, guys. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Do you have a little blood thing there going on?  What?  Is it dripping blood now?  Well, yeah, well, I have blood inside of me, believe it or not.  Yeah, that's hot.  Okay, hey, I have little gifts for you guys.  No, I don't want to give them.  No, it's not.  Wait, wait.  I got to lay down a minute.  I just got to...  Let me lay down.  Let me take them out.  Hold on.  I got to lay down.  No, no, no.  This is good.  Y'all will like it.  Hold on.  Let me lay down.  I just shopped for Chance.  And this is for Opie because I know he likes beautiful black women.  Yeah, sure.  This is the same magazine company.  Black Loss, of course.  And for you...  What do I got? 
[02:44:30]  Because I know you like gel bait.  This is all the little girls.  Just 18.  Yes, and for Norton, because he's like my kind of boy, he likes all the unusual stuff,  so I got him some plumpers.  You gave me a book of fat chicks?  She would have survived Africa, no problem.  Dude, I will trade you Black Loss for plumpers.  Yeah, you take plumpers.  I want the 18.  Give me the pedo one.  Hey, give me my plumpers.  Hey, I get the 18.  And, of course, I have swank for whoever is interested in some beautiful, lusty, beautiful  women.  Hey, I think Mike is going to say it all today, Anthony. 
[02:45:00]  Mike, what do you have for this radio show today?  Boys, if you're going to do a show, have a point.  Norton, always funny.  Thank you, Mike.  Opie, today you ruled.  All right, thank you.  Yep.  I tried.  I'm speechless, guys.  Yeah.  Isn't it amazing?  Oh, yeah, Dr. Carl's here.  I'm coming here to Survivor Africa.  Now we're all just thumbing through our respective porno.  You're all getting a point.  Look at this.  You know, why not?  Everybody's right.  Can I promo my new gin?  It just came out on the stands two days ago. 
[02:45:30]  Can you put your shirt back on?  2001.  Why?  You don't like my breasts?  I'm a little freaked out.  The scars, the anthrax.  We'll give you one pose.  But I'm a trooper.  The rash on your arm.  I know you're hot and all, but you really screwed up yourself.  It's going to take some time to heal.  No, I'm a trooper.  I'm here for Rick.  All right.  Sure.  You're a trooper.  Okay.  Hey, we've got to get the F out of here.  Dr. Carl, you're going to have to come back because we ran out of show.  Yeah.  Big star like you.  Big star.  I know.  How do I follow this, guys?  I know.  I'm not pumping up my privates. 
[02:46:00]  I can't believe we talked to Wrangler Jane before you.  What's wrong with Wrangler Jane?  What's wrong?  Oh, it was a star-studded show today is what it was.  I can't believe we didn't get to talk to Dabney Coleman more.  All right.  Listen, really fast.  We have a bunch of Grave Rave tickets left.
