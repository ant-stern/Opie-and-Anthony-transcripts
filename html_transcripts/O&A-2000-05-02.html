<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Opie detailing his pre-show routine, which includes medication and a beer, while discussing upcoming segments like a "yell at Spazz" segment (for $5) and the distribution of "WOW" stickers.  The hosts then delve into the disastrous moving experience of their co-worker, Spazz, who is essentially homeless, living in a U-Haul and budget hotels due to his new apartment being unavailable.  Audio clips of Spazz yelling during his move are played.  The excessive number of "WOW" stickers and Earl's resulting stress are also discussed.  A caller, Lisa, shares her experience with the "WOW" campaign, including sexually explicit details about her interactions with other drivers who saw her "WOW" sign, detailing body measurements and sexual acts.  Other listeners call in with their own "WOW" experiences and updates on sticker distribution, prompting discussions about creating more stickers.  Comedian Dice is also a topic of conversation; the hosts discuss his recent call thanking them for inspiring his return to comedy and his newfound faith, followed by humorous, blasphemous impersonations of Diceâ€™s religious fervor, including crude jokes relating to genitalia.  Opie promotes Diamond Vision laser eye surgery, sharing his personal experience and details of a Memorial Day drawing.  The hosts repeatedly use the phrase "I'm over here now," and quote racial slurs from *Blazing Saddles*, continuing to tease Spazz's predicament throughout the segment.

The broadcast continues with a focus on the chaotic "WOW" sticker distribution at Fidelity Diamond in Paramus, New Jersey.  Black Earl, responsible for delivering the stickers, repeatedly gets lost, leading to numerous calls from frustrated listeners and staff attempting to guide him.  Earl's exasperated cries for help ("Help me! Help me!") and his ironic use of "I'm over here now" punctuate this segment.  Listeners call in with updates on (or the lack of) Earl's location, offering humorous commentary and suggestions.  The hosts also discuss sponsors (Fidelity Diamond and Rockaway Bedding), a listener's birthday, and listener-submitted content from Indialink.com (an Indian message board), which is declared the "enemy of the show" due to negative responses to a previous segment.  Callers describe the growing crowd at Fidelity Diamond awaiting the stickers, and Earl's eventual, delayed arrival creates a massive traffic jam.  The hosts briefly discuss a celebrity appearance on *Who Wants to be a Millionaire* and play their song "Hey, Masturbator."  The segment is rife with the use of racial and other slurs.

The final segment begins with a humorous discussion about the unrealistic expectations of achieving a "Bo Derek" beach look without Bo Derek's physique.  Calls are taken, with Earl (from Fidelity Diamond) reporting heavy traffic from the sticker giveaway and experiencing poor phone connection.  Jeff comments on Kathy Lee Gifford's outfit on *Millionaire*, comparing it to a John Belushi *Saturday Night Live* skit.  Jake recounts drunkenly singing the *Titanic* theme song at a wedding.  The conversation shifts to Evil Knievel endorsing mobility scooters for the elderly, prompting humorous speculation and disgust.  A prank call to a scooter retailer is played, featuring an elderly man requesting a scooter with an oxygen tank and making morbid jokes.  The Stacker 2 cupcake commercial is also discussed.  Callers provide updates on the traffic at the "WOW" sticker event.  The segment concludes with a "What Did We Learn?" game based on listener feedback and a preview of the planned "Whip Em Out Wednesday" segment.  Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous racial and other slurs are used.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Remember this little ditty after that?  Yes, I do.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone line.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey!  It's our show.  It's your show.  Ah, you're right in.  Ah, I feel a bunch better.  Heh, heh, heh, heh.  I had to medicate myself. 
[00:00:30]  I wouldn't have a nervous breakdown.  Yeah, I needed a little attitude adjustment before the show.  Yeah, that happens.  You get fun little phone calls and stuff.  Like, ah, oh, crack a fridge.  I need a pre-show beer.  It's very rare, but occasionally you need the pre-show beer.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  All better now, though.  Good.  Oh, I got a pitch.  What sucks more is that it's hard for you to talk about.  I can't.  You know, it gets used against me. 
[00:01:00]  It's the crap that's going on when we're not on the air.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Yeah, that dice thing from yesterday was great.  Oh, God.  Is that true?  Rolling Stones planning a tour for 2001?  Oh.  Oh, my Lord.  I think they're having a contest.  Who's going to drop that on stage first?  The who or the Stones?  So they keep going out on the road.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  The Stones 2001 tour, huh? 
[00:01:30]  I'm just mesmerized by the Cypress Hill.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of grooving to it.  Without a doubt.  Actually, we're running late, so we've got to take another break.  So we're that quick.  We're kind of stalling.  Yeah, those two segments we just ran were really long, so they'll put us behind.  Yeah.  But that's okay.  All right, why don't you guys call.  Spazz will put you on hold.  We'll go to the phones next.  We'll get the show going, okay?  Yeah.  Another fun show for you all today. 
[00:02:00]  For you all.  Who put this one together?  This is so choppy, it's not even funny.  Mark did it?  Mark did it.  Yeah, Mark's not that good of me.  We could have a cranky show today.  Well, the cranky shows are some of my favorite shows.  I love the cranky shows.  The cranky shows are great.  You don't know who the one is that's going to explode.  Yeah.  Lose their mind.  You know, and I think, oh, the $5 to yell at Spazz thing is happening Thursday. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  A ton of people calling about that already.  It's going to happen Thursday.  We need more time to put it together, okay?  The stupid lawyers had to get involved to make sure that it's all on the up and up.  Speaking of Spazz, let's take a break.  Oh, I heard he's having some trouble.  Spazz, God damn it, man.  I swear, you guys, we just want Spazz on the radio once a week.  To do the little week in review.  Yeah.  You know, because, I mean, there's so many other things to do on our radio show.  But his life.  But his life is so effed up and out of control that you've got to put the stuff. 
[00:03:00]  The stuff on the air.  I like having him around.  It makes me feel better.  He wasn't in yesterday because he had to move into his new apartment.  A movie.  All right.  That went horribly wrong yesterday.  Horribly wrong.  Huge mess.  Spazz is living out of a truck.  Spazz is officially homeless?  Is that what we're gathering?  Spazz is officially homeless.  Yes.  So this yell at Spazz for five bucks thing that we're doing Thursday could come in handy for Spazz. 
[00:03:30]  He really needs it.  I'm not kidding.  He is homeless.  Oh, my God.  We'll get into the story next, all right?  And we'll get the festivities going here.  The phone line, once again, 212-757-1027.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  It's the O&A show.  Got smacked in the background.  Those guys finally working on their next CD.  Should be out like late this year, it looks like. 
[00:04:00]  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  We've got to go to Lisa real fast here.  Lisa, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  I just wowed somebody.  Look how happy she is.  Is it the first time you've wowed somebody?  It was my maiden voyage, yes.  Was it fun for you?  It really was.  All right.  Give us the details.  Was there a wow on the guy's car or something, or you just felt like wowing?  No, actually, there was a wow.  He made it out of scotch tape on the big back windshield.  And as we were cruising by, we were over by CW Post. 
[00:04:30]  They were stopped, stuck in a light.  My girlfriend slowed down, and I just wowed them.  Wow, look at her.  She's freaking.  Look how happy you are.  I told you.  It's a cool thing, huh?  It really was fun.  And how big are your boobies there, Lisa?  I'm a 26C.  26C?  What?  Wow.  That's an unusual size.  26C?  I'm big.  The top's tiny, though, because I'm working out.  So you're like thin with big boobs.  I have tiny hips, yeah.  You're like a skeleton with big boobs. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  That's okay.  Okay.  I'm not a skeleton, but I've never heard any complaints.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'6".  5'6", and how much do you weigh?  125.  Hmm.  I've never heard 26C.  26C.  That's small up top.  I mean, small back, anyway.  Yeah.  Well, go ahead.  I just, I'm giggly.  I'm telling you, this Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing works.  The guys with the wow in their cars, and the girls, they see the wow signs. 
[00:05:30]  If they feel like it, they flash the guy.  Simple as that.  Simple concept.  It was the greatest thing.  And they're beeping and they're yelling, but my girlfriend kept cruising, and they didn't  bother us.  They didn't bother us.  Yeah, we like to hear that.  Guys, just let it happen.  Don't harass the ladies.  Please let them go about their business, okay?  I'm going to continue wowing now.  Hey, do you like a good TF?  Oh, no.  Who's a TF?  TF.  Figure it out.  Here we go.  See, you got like a little back, but you got some nice melons there.  Okay. 
[00:06:00]  I have nice melons.  Yeah.  Do you like giving a guy a good TF-ing?  Ah.  Ah.  Yeah.  We have a winner.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The sharpest tag in the box I have.  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Oh, you do?  I do.  All right.  That's a turn-on for you?  It honestly is.  Yeah, TF-ing is really cool.  That's pretty good.  A lot of women want to admit to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, guys, you've inspired me. 
[00:06:30]  We inspired you.  Oh, good.  Well, thank you for wowing today, Lisa.  You're welcome.  Day early.  You're going to see, yeah, day early, really, but you're going to see wow signs all over the  place in another couple weeks.  You watch.  Wait a minute.  We weren't supposed to start yet?  No, no.  Oh, no.  Of course.  It's seven days a week.  Of course.  It is seven days a week, but on Wednesdays, we pretty much focus on the whole thing.  Oh, okay.  Then you know what?  I'll save my fun bags until Wednesday.  No, no, no, no.  You see any more wow signs out there, you go for it, Lisa. 
[00:07:00]  Yesterday, I was stuck in traffic at Hofstra.  I wanted to get a wow sticker myself just to have one.  Sure.  Couldn't get through.  Dude, jammed up.  Well, there's a couple ways to get them today.  Participating Ranch One locations will have the wow stickers.  And Fidelity Diamond, Route 17, south in Paramus, New Jersey.  Earl's going to be there at 4 o'clock with a ton of wow stickers.  All right.  And you don't have to wow Earl, right?  No, no, no.  No, he won't like that anyway. 
[00:07:30]  All right, Lisa, we're going to let you go.  You're too giggly to talk to.  I'm sorry, guys.  Have a great one.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  She likes a good TFing, Opie.  How about that?  TF rocks.  She actually is turned on by the TF, a nice hard TF.  Bravo.  Earl is bitching and complaining, Anthony.  What about now?  Well, we've been telling everyone to send in the self-addressed stamped envelope for the brand  new wow stickers.  And I swear to God, it looks like the mail room for the Backstreet Boys in here. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, it does.  It's just like they just empty the mail bag on Earl's desk.  It's just piled up.  And I know why he's so bummed, because he finally has to work.  Yeah.  He's pissed off.  He goes, he's sent out well over 5,000 envelopes at this point, Anthony.  Yes.  Oh, he has?  Yeah.  Personally?  Personally, yes.  He's sent out 5,000 wow stickers through the mail thus far.  All right, Earl.  You guys sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to Earl. 
[00:08:30]  It's hilarious.  Do we have any...  He's so pissed off.  Do we have any documentation that actually proves that he's done that?  No.  Well, I've just seen the boxes and boxes of mail that has been coming in.  So I'm assuming he's doing his job for us.  The next man makes a move.  The nigger gets it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Where did that come from?  That's from Blazing Saddle.  The Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Oh, my God.  I think we can get... 
[00:09:00]  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  That's actual audio of Earl, Anthony, in the back room getting out the wow stickers.  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Earl is overwhelmed back there with the wow stickers, Anthony.  Overwhelmed.  Obviously.  Wow.  He said he sent 5,000 out?  Yeah, I was asking him.  Oh, wait.  Because I was busting on him.  I can't believe that.  He's all pissed off. 
[00:09:30]  He says that's all he does now around here.  All right.  When did we start doing it?  Let's do some simple math.  We only gave out the address maybe a week and a half ago.  Okay, so how many stickers would he have to send out during his time here to equal 5,000  every day?  Yeah, it doesn't match up.  No.  We're getting about 200 to 300 envelopes a day.  5,000.  He's full of it.  So, if you want to send in a self-adjusted stamped envelope for the wow sticker, it's  very easy. 
[00:10:00]  Just write, attention, wow sticker, WNW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York,  10106.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Earl's on the line.  Earl, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Earl.  We're on our way down to Paramus and the Fidelity Dimes again.  I'll have some more wow stickers.  Yeah, the wow sticker stop today is Fidelity Dimes, Route 17, South Paramus.  They'll be there by 4.  Yeah, right. 
[00:10:30]  Earl, you've sent out 5,000 wow stickers in the mail?  Not me personally.  I can assure you that that many went out.  But not me personally, no.  Who else do you have helping you?  Jeremy's assistant's been helping out.  She's been great.  All right.  And that's it, huh?  Yeah.  And the both of you have sent out 5,000 stickers.  I know I've gone through at least one box.  Which is what, 2,500?  3,500.  3,500? 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  All right, Earl.  Oh, oh, oh, help me, help me, help me, somebody help me, help me, help me.  That's Earl yelling for help earlier today.  I'm just yelling for help.  Yeah, you asked me what was...  We have actual audio of you.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, help me, help me, help me.  Somebody help me, help me, help me.  Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he say, do what he say. 
[00:11:30]  Earl, you're losing it back there, huh?  He's got some great audio of you all of a sudden.  Come on, how about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  That's from Blazing Saddles.  What are you guys trying to do to me here?  I love that movie.  Huh?  I love that movie.  That's a good one.  All right, Earl.  Well, you have fun at Fidelity Diamond at the WOW sticker stop.  There should be a lot of O&A fans out there when you guys arrive at 4 o'clock, okay? 
[00:12:00]  The WOWs are definitely welcome.  All right.  Route 17 South, Paramus, New Jersey.  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  All right, Earl.  We've got to let you go.  We've got a show to do.  All right.  We keep you on the air all day.  Our ratings are going to plummet.  Well, thanks a lot.  All right, bye.  We'll see you there.  Bye.  Shut up!  What you want on this wall? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, brother.  Here's more Earl audio.  What you want on this wall?  What you want on this wall?  What you want on this wall?  What you want on this wall?  What you want on this wall?  What you want on...  Earl's gay.  Terrific.  Yeah, are we taking any bets on what time Earl actually gets there?  I'll bet for...  He gets lost every time.  Yeah.  Earl has never left the tri-state area.  He's, what, 30 years old, close to it? 
[00:13:00]  He gets lost every time he has to drive that van somewhere.  Yeah.  Every single time.  Doesn't matter if it's down the street, Jersey, Long Island.  Manhattan.  Every time.  Every time he gets lost.  He gets lost in his own neighborhood.  That's right.  He doesn't even know where he lives.  Well, that's a story for another day.  Wait, who was part of that story?  Ben and Mark?  That happened twice.  Oh, that happened twice.  He tried to find his way home.  And Earl does not know how to get to his house.  To his house. 
[00:13:30]  If he's in a car.  Yeah.  Because people out there are like, no way, how do you not know where you live by car?  He doesn't, because he takes the subway system.  Oh, oh, help me, help me, help me.  Somebody help me, help me, help me.  We have found a new clip, Anthony, that we can enjoy for the next month or two, huh?  Dude, we ended up at JFK Airport trying to drive him home one night.  I'm like, this isn't the right way.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Help me. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I'm moving.  Help me, help me, help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me, help me.  Let's go to Ray real fast.  Earl's calling back.  Ray, what's up?  What's going on?  How are you, Ray?  Good, very good.  First of all, these guys are the bomb.  I listen to these guys every day at work.  Thank you, sir.  All right, thank you, Ray.  What do you have today for the show?  Let's go.  First of all, these guys, I want to give you permission.  I want to give out at least 1,000, 2,000 copies of that.  Wow.  I want everyone doing that around where I'm at, midtown. 
[00:14:30]  Wait, so you work at a copier place?  Yeah, I'm making tons of copies.  We want you to make tons of copies.  Okay, terrific.  See, this wow thing is like a virus.  You guys do with it what you have to, man.  Copy it.  You know, post it places.  We don't care.  Definitely.  You can't even walk around the station without seeing wow all over the streets.  I wonder who is the guy who's been sticking the wow stickers all over the place around  this building.  I wonder who that would be.  Upper west side. 
[00:15:00]  All right, Ray.  Yeah, you can do that.  Yeah, because I'm from Brooklyn, too.  So I'm sending a ton of them out to Brooklyn, too, to all the guys.  All the girls.  Brooklyn.  I'm going to put in all the cars.  Right on, man.  You know?  We want this to spread like a virus.  Definitely, definitely.  All right.  Thank you, Ray.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn, Jennifer, what's going on?  Hey, Anthony, I wanted to ask you if you forgot when your brother used to make you hand  out the flyers for the band.  Yeah.  And you used to ditch them.  Yeah.  What do you think Earl's doing with all the wow stickers?  Maybe. 
[00:15:30]  Earl's gay.  Terrific.  Very good.  I just want to thank you guys for introducing me to Slipknot.  I went out and got the CD.  They kick ass.  Yes.  The Slipknot rocks.  That's some angry music, huh?  You put that CD in your CD player and you do some T-F-ing.  Sounds good.  All right, Jennifer.  Thanks a lot.  Please.  Hang up on her.  I can't take the F-ing name.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's a new rule on the O&A show.  If your name is Jennifer, you've got to change the name. 
[00:16:00]  Change it to something else.  Anything.  If you want to be on our radio show.  Change it to anything.  And if we meet you at a club appearance or a road show and your name's Jennifer.  Just lie.  Say it's Mary or something.  Just blatantly lie.  Yeah.  Please.  My stomach is turning every time I look at the name on the computer screen.  Let's go to Bill real fast.  Bill, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Bill.  Bill.  It's Chuck or Bill, man.  Yo, I want to thank you guys. 
[00:16:30]  I got a pre-wow this morning.  What's a pre-wow?  What's a pre-wow?  Well, it's not Wednesday yet.  No, no.  Let's make this perfectly clear.  Wow happens all the time.  We just focus on it on Wednesday.  When Ant and I started this whole wow thing, yeah, it started on Wednesday.  But we have expanded the concept.  Yes.  Cool.  I was sitting at a traffic light in New Brunswick and, you know, totally forgot about this  sticker on the side of the truck.  And all of a sudden I hear, yo, O&A.  And I turn over and here's two chicks with their boobs hanging out. 
[00:17:00]  Nice.  Nice.  I'm telling you.  Definitely.  I'm telling you, this wow thing works like a charm, man.  Hey.  Just put the sticker on your car, maybe a homemade sign, and just forget about it.  Don't expect to be wowed.  It will happen.  What?  O&A.  Yeah.  Sunder what?  All right, man.  Exactly.  Take it easy.  Thank you, Bill.  Just wait until the nice weather.  Oh, forget about it.  It's going to be wow all over the place.  Hey, Butch, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  I just wonder how long ago I was going to be down on 17 today. 
[00:17:30]  In Paramus?  He should be there a good hour.  All right.  I'm a truck driver.  I'm stuck up in New York, so I'm going to try to make it down there.  Yeah.  Well, we encourage everyone to go to Fidelity Diamond to get their wow stickers today.  Earl, we'll be there at 4 o'clock, Route 17, South Paramus, New Jersey.  Cool.  All right, man.  Vacation Underground, guys.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  I want to say hi to everyone checking out the show illegally today.  You know who you are.  Last I checked, there were 28 of you.  Thank you.  All over the country.  Loving the show.  Loving the show.  That's right.  I'm over here now. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, cool.  Get me that one.  That's mine.  Oh, I love that one.  That's mine.  I'm over here now.  You got the Earl, help me, help me, and I got the dice for a while.  I'm over here now.  Be quiet, sir.  I'm over here now.  Be quiet, sir.  I'm over here now.  Be quiet, sir.  I'm over here now.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  I am superfied, man. 
[00:18:30]  I love that one, man.  We're adding new signs every day.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I was laughing on the way home, just thinking, because we touched on it at the end of the show.  The Born Again Dice.  So when he first called yesterday, he sounded a little odd.  Yeah.  Like he was a dice that we aren't used to hearing until he pulled out the slapping your yambag against the rays.  You know.  And that was such an amazing call yesterday.  We are going to play it late in the show today. 
[00:19:00]  Cool.  Because, I mean, out of nowhere, Dice calls us and pretty much thanks us for inspiring him to move on with his career.  He was sitting at home, feeling a little down.  Yeah.  And then he decided, you know, I had fun on the O&A show.  I should get out there and get off my ass again and start putting an album out.  He said that was his motivation.  He's been going to the clubs every night now.  He's going to put out the CD after all.  And he was thanking us.  He said we inspired him.  And being a kid, you know, growing up on Long Island and when I discovered comedy, there was a few people I discovered right off the bat. 
[00:19:30]  Kinison and Dice.  Yeah.  Right off the bat.  So to hear someone like Dice saying that you and I inspired him, that's just mental.  Yeah.  That was a little weird.  And then, but the way he sounded kind of sounded like a born-again Christian talking to you, you know?  Yeah.  Where he just sounded very sensitive and opening up.  Yeah, I found Jesus Christ. 
[00:20:00]  I walk with the Lord now.  Jesus Christ, he's over here now.  In Dice's heart.  Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.  Yeah, I've got to change the back of my jacket because I'm now a disciple of Jesus.  You hear me?  And you'll hear the words of Christ.  Yeah.  You know, would that just be too much?  That would be something I would check out if he decided to be like, you know, a minister or something. 
[00:20:30]  I'd go to church every Sunday.  Jesus walked around healing people wearing a loincloth so the lepers wouldn't have to look at his yambang.  Okay?  Okay?  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  So he's walking around.  He sees a leper, you know?  And they're like, oh, Jesus.  Could you cure me?  Yeah, sure.  Slap the nose back on your face.  I'll wave my hand.  You'll be okay. 
[00:21:00]  Hey!  Praise the Lord.  Thice would like the Virgin Mary, that's for sure, huh?  Hey, I'm a man of God now.  Yeah.  I can't be saying things about the Virgin Mary.  No, of course not.  You know, I would have liked to slip her a nice one in the old days.  Because she is a virgin.  Oh!  Oh!  Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.  Now I've found the words of Jesus. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  Christ is my Savior.  Anthony, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys are like miracle workers.  Listen, if you could get Dice to be funny again, you should get Christopher Reeves on the show.  Maybe you can make him walk again.  Well, let me tell you something.  Dice was hilarious yesterday.  I was, my mother was listening to the show.  She was laughing.  It was like listening to the old Dice before any bull crap.  You know what I mean?  We brought the best out of them yesterday and last week. 
[00:22:00]  And if you didn't hear Dice calling yesterday, please hang out later on the show.  You're not going to believe it.  It was really funny.  The midget stuff had me dying.  But you know when he first came on, he sounded like he was going senile or something.  He was really, it just sounded like very sensitive, almost like I said, like the born again.  When someone gets born again Christian, oh my God.  That's all they're talking about, 24 hours a day and they try to convert you and everything.  I found God.  I'm walking with Jesus.  You ever see that picture with the footprints in the sand? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, there's only one set of footprints.  And Jesus walking next to me during the times of my life.  And I said, hey, Jesus, how come during the toughest parts of my life, there's only one set of footprints?  Why'd you leave me, you scumbag?  And he said, no, Dice, that's when I carried you.  So I broke down crying in tears.  Well, you know, Jesus and Dice, they're both with Jews, right? 
[00:23:00]  Well, Anthony, I think we were like step seven in his 12-step program yesterday.  Oh, you know what he should call his new album?  Huh?  He should call it, hello, they call me, my name is Dice.  Hello, my, they, yeah.  Okay, terrific.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Thank you, Anthony.  Don't give me the train.  All right, bye.  All right, bye.  There he goes.  Let me read now from the book of Dice.  You need a personal relationship with God. 
[00:23:30]  We're all equal.  The jinx, the colored, the midgets, the whores.  We're all children of God over here.  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  It's such a raise.  Okay?  Okay.  I'm dying over here.  You know, I don't want to be laying there dying over here.  Before I find Jesus.  Before you find Jesus. 
[00:24:00]  Because Satan does seem like a lot of fun.  I don't want to go through eternity with a pitchfork in my ass.  Okay?  Oh!  A dream, you know, bigger than selling out the garden would be St. Dice.  Okay?  The patron saint of studded leather jackets.  Huh?  I'm over here now.  Where are you?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now. 
[00:24:30]  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Oh!  Oh, bro.  I think we're going to have the new dice on the show all day today.  The dice that has found Jesus.  I'll be at St. Whack Bag Episcopal Church.  A clause from Laugh Your Yam Bag Zord.  Hey, Joseph Brown, I'm checking in.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony. 
[00:25:00]  Off to a flying start.  On the O&A show.  Just remember, Christ, the Opie and Anthony show.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Diamond Vision.  Yes.  You want to see, don't you, without your glasses?  Speaking of God, Dr. Philotoff is my God.  He's like Jesus.  He is like Jesus to me. 
[00:25:30]  He goes around.  He's a miracle worker.  People come to him if they can't see too good.  That's right.  And he says, look, I'll fix your eyeballs.  That's right.  And before you know it, you're throwing away your glasses and looking for Jesus.  Oh!  Well, I'm seeing 2015, thanks to Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  Better than 2020.  Better than what God gave me at birth, Anthony.  Hey, is this a script?  No, you don't have to do the script.  At one point it says, uh...  What? 
[00:26:00]  Diamond Vision, Spring Special, just $2,500.  Right.  And then it says, Anthony says, $2,500 per eye.  Right.  And then I say, no, Anthony, that's $2,500 for both eyes.  Thanks to, uh...  Diamond Vision, Laser Vision Correction.  It's affordable to anyone who wants to see better without glasses.  Could they please not write my lines in on some of the copies?  Yeah, we don't need scripts, guys.  We can talk about Diamond Vision, no problem.  One of the easiest spots ever because Opie had it done. 
[00:26:30]  Had it done.  I am completely happy.  I cannot believe that I have 2015 vision.  I still, to this day, leave the house going, oh, my God, where are my glasses?  I run back inside.  I go, oh, yeah, you idiot.  You don't need them anymore.  You smashed them with a hammer.  You smashed them.  And then I find myself doing this all day.  Pushing up imaginary glasses onto the bridge of your nose.  Yeah, it's bizarre.  But, yeah, it's a great, great thing.  I absolutely love it.  I don't know what else to tell you guys.  If you wear glasses, you really should look into this, okay? 
[00:27:00]  There's a couple things going on.  They're doing a Memorial Day drawing.  Basically, what you do is you call up Diamond Vision, 1-800-984-2020.  1-800-984-2020.  You put your name in the drawing.  They're going to give one of our listeners the procedure for free, okay?  Nice.  So you got that going on.  If you put your name in for some of the past drawings, you're still eligible when they pick the name for this one, okay?  Cool.  But if you don't want to wait or you're not picked down the road, Diamond Vision is running their spring special, which is $2,500 for the whole procedure, okay? 
[00:27:30]  It's Diamond Vision, Anthony, 1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020. 
[00:28:00]  Well, are you having fun with our little radio show today, Dr. Smith?  We played a little game.  That was fun.  O.B. and Anthony.  Oh, they're both lovely ladies, my dear.  That is 1027-WNE-W.  I love that one.  Oh, dear.  It's the O&A Show, 212-757-1027.  Instant feedback working.  You can get through the show through the WNEW website. 
[00:28:30]  Joe from Jersey, right?  Hey, guys, I already learned something on your show today.  I learned Christ's last words on the cross where I'm dying over here.  Oh.  Dying over here.  Bam.  All right, where's Spaz?  Spaz had some problems moving yesterday.  We got to get into that a little bit.  Vince, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  I was in Penn Station yesterday. 
[00:29:00]  I had a bunch of your WOW stickers from Roosevelt Field, and the cops saw me jumping up on the subway signs,  taping them right near the E-train station.  And he comes over.  He's like, you know, what are you doing?  He looks up at the sign.  He's like, all right, just don't put up too many of them.  Yeah, there you go.  WOW spreading like a virus all over this fine city of ours.  Yes, I was laughing.  I was going for lunch today, and there's WOW stickers all over our neighborhood.  Yeah, I know.  I work up on the Upper East Side. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And I actually even was able to stick a couple on some diplomats' cars.  Cool, Vince.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  All right, later.  Hey, man, if the company's not going to advertise our show, we'll do our own advertising.  That's it.  That's how the show was operated since we got here.  Guerrilla Marketing.  Yes.  We'll get the name out there.  Word of mouth and WOW stickers all over the place.  Internet.  We're all over.  We're entrenched.  All right.  Well, Spaz is in the studio.  Oh. 
[00:30:00]  Here comes a sorry story.  We ought to have sad violin music.  Something.  For Spaz.  Naughtiest theme.  That sappy song, remember?  Yeah.  That was also a theme for a soap opera, I think.  Mm-hmm.  But Nadia Comaneci stole it for the Olympics.  Yeah.  So they renamed it Nadia's theme.  Spaz, how are you?  There you go.  He's plugging in his headphones.  Have better days.  Spaz, you called me at home.  Have better days.  Called me at home on Sunday and said, hey, I need Monday off.  I'm moving. 
[00:30:30]  Mm-hmm.  Spaz, why didn't you want to give me a call?  I don't have your number.  Oh, okay.  Want to give it to me?  No, that's okay.  Okay.  Once we get a little closer, maybe I'll give you the number.  Okay.  And trust me, you're not missing much.  So I said, sure, Spaz.  Take Monday off and move.  Mm-hmm.  First of all, you're moving how far from the radio station?  Well, it's an hour and a half on the short line, and then I've got to take a path over  to the town.  The short bus?  So just listen to this commute.  Okay.  Like, there are people out there that they have no choice. 
[00:31:00]  They have to do, like, a two, two-and-a-half-hour commute each way.  Yeah.  Spaz has the choice, but he has decided this is what he wants to do.  All right, so it's an hour and a half on the short train.  Yeah.  And then what?  And then I've got to take a path over to Penn Station, and I've got to take the shuttle  train over to the NR, and I'll take the NR up to 57th.  How many different trains?  Is that four?  Four.  Four trains a day you're getting on?  Four trains.  Yeah.  All right, door to door.  Mm-hmm.  Like two. 
[00:31:30]  Here's the first one.  Here comes the other one.  He takes the little one like in Disney.  Yeah.  The Thunder Mountain Railroad.  Now, Spaz, keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times, and remember, no flash  photography.  So you take four trains.  Four trains each way.  Each way.  Okay, well, door to door, when you leave the spaz pad in the morning, and then you get 
[00:32:00]  into work, and you say hi to Rick, who's here first, how long does that take?  Well, I don't know yet.  I haven't moved here yet.  How much would you guess?  Like two hours?  Easily?  I'm assuming.  I haven't done the commute yet.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  So, Spaz, yesterday was moving, damn.  We're moving all night.  Too deep, too high.  Too deep, like the hot loose.  In the sky. 
[00:32:30]  How'd you like to move all my rocks?  Moving all night.  Okay, terrific.  We've finally got to pick up the pie.  Hey, hey!  I had no idea.  There ain't no burn on the grill.  There's a whole lot of trying to get up that hill.  Now we're up in the big leagues.  Get my turn and set.  Stupid!  You and me, baby.  There ain't nothing wrong with that. 
[00:33:00]  Stupid!  Okay, terrific.  Let me go ahead.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Hi, this is Sherman Hensley.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  All right, so yesterday was moving day. 
[00:33:30]  Spaz is in his groovy new place.  Ouch!  No, you're...  What happened?  Yeah, how's the new place?  How's the new place?  Come on, we all want to know.  I haven't seen it yet.  And why haven't you seen it yet?  I'm having a little trouble with the realtor people.  So I'm not living there right now.  What?  Oh, my...  All right, Spaz, you moved out of your old place.  Because we have to, yes.  We have to.  We were even forced out there.  Forced out?  Why forced out? 
[00:34:00]  Well, because...  Well, complications with roommates and...  Stupidly, I set a date with the landlord and my roommate saying I was going to be out by May 1st  and they had people moving in already, so we had to get out.  Okay.  So you pack up all the time, sure.  You pack up all the goods.  In the U-Haul.  In the U-Haul.  To move to your new place.  Yes.  So you...  But it wasn't set in stone that you were going to move into this new place, but you just  assumed that...  Well, they said it would be ready, but it's not.  We're having complications.  Complications.  So what?  You drove the truck over there and they said no. 
[00:34:30]  No, I didn't even get that far.  We...  They said no right when we were about to move this stuff into the truck, but we had to  be out by like 9 o'clock last night, so we had to move this stuff in the truck  anyway.  Just me and Erica.  So now, all your stuff is in a truck.  Yeah.  And where are you staying?  I'm hotel hopping.  I'm at the St. Regis.  Are you staying at the St. Regis?  No.  What kind of hotels? 
[00:35:00]  Best Western.  Very good.  You're getting a little smarter.  How's the butler over at Best Western?  Is he iron your heavy metal shirts?  No.  Do you realize you could have spent 10 days in like a Best Western as opposed to one night  at the St. Regis?  I realize that.  Yeah.  So you're pretty much homeless right now.  Every morning I have to go into the U-Haul to get clothes for today.  And my clothes are in the back, so I'm digging. 
[00:35:30]  And it's kind of embarrassing when everybody's in the parking lot looking to be digging the  back of the U-Haul for clothes.  Now, is there any kind of timetable on when you're going to be able to move into this new  place?  It could be anywhere from two minutes from now to 10 days from now.  Why so long?  Realtor problems.  Can I say it?  It's obvious.  It is obvious.  No credit.  No.  They do credit checks.  Your credit must be a nightmare and they're a little scared and that's why they didn't let  you move into the new place, right?  It's a part of the reason, but not total reason. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, my God.  What is the rest of the reason?  Well, the rest of the reason is just one realtor is being a pain in the ass.  Well, how are they being a pain in the ass?  Because they don't like the fact that, well, they don't think that I can pay the renters  or other things like that.  Well, that's a credit problem.  That's called a credit problem.  Oh, I thought you were talking about my past credit history.  No, no, no.  That's, oh, my God.  And there's a lot of bidders there, too, who could easily outbid me because of our 
[00:36:30]  credit history.  There's a good possibility you're going to lose this place and have no place to live.  Yeah.  And continue living out of your U-Haul now.  Which I pay $45 a day on, too.  Oh, my God.  $45 a day for the U-Haul plus the hotel rooms you're crashing in.  Yeah.  So your $47,000 debt is going up by the day.  Yes, it is.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:00]  You've got to live in a refrigerator box for us.  For, like, a couple days.  No.  That would be hilarious.  Right outside the station.  You could sing with Opera Man every day and collect your breakfast money.  No.  I'm not going to do that.  But without the credit card, this all wouldn't be possible.  Oh, really?  I wouldn't be able to get the U-Haul.  I wouldn't be able to have a U-Haul.  You wouldn't be able to build up more debt without your credit card.  Ralph has a problem with you.  Ralph, what's up?  Yeah, I used to commute from Newark to Philadelphia every day. 
[00:37:30]  It was over an hour on the Amtrak Metro Line, or I swore I'd never do it again.  This kid's got to commute at least three times that.  Does he have a clue?  No.  Can you tell us what county you're going to live in?  I believe it's...  I think it's Orange.  Spaz, can you get this station from your house?  We're at the outskirts of this.  He's not even in the signal radius.  Why are you living so far? 
[00:38:00]  Why, honestly, did you move so far away?  It was a joint decision.  What, you smoked a bunch of joints and decided to move very far away from your place of work?  No, it's just that I decided I needed a change.  I needed to get out of the Iona town, and it was convenient for Erica.  So what the hell, Wyoming sounded good to me.  So how is it convenient for Erica?  How is Erica's commute every day?  A 15-minute drive.  Aren't you learning anything from him? 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  All right.  You're not learning anything from him?  And all of us...  Spaz and everything are up there.  What?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Spaz.  What?  What are you doing?  Well, we talked about it for a couple hours.  What is Erica's job?  How much money does she bring home?  It ranges.  From what?  Hundreds of thousands of dollars?  What is she, a stockbroker?  No.  What does she do?  Real estate tycoon.  I'd rather not go into it.  What line of work is she in? 
[00:39:00]  What line of work is she in that she gets the 15-minute commute, and you get well over  two hours, what people are starting to say on the screen here.  She's in the eatery business.  The eatery business.  She's a waitress.  She's a waitress.  I could be.  I don't know.  Wait, you don't know what Erica does for a living?  I do know, but I'm not saying.  If she's in the eatery business, it's either a waitress or a hooker.  Does she serve food?  Does she serve food, Spaz? 
[00:39:30]  Does she serve food?  That was a good line, right?  Yeah, she serves food.  She serves food.  Okay, she serves food.  That's what she does.  Yes.  You, on the other hand, are in a job where it is a career.  Yes.  You are starting a career.  Very stressful.  You take a lot of abuse on the show.  Mm-hmm.  Would it have been easier for her to get a job closer to your job, or for you to get  a job like you have here, closer to where you're living now?  Well, that's out of the question. 
[00:40:00]  I'm not moving out of this thing.  What?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  No, Spaz, the answer is, it's impossible for you to get a job like this, close to where  you're working, anywhere else.  Right.  Wouldn't it be easy for her to get a new job somewhere else, closer to the city?  Yes.  Yes, but after talking to her about it, we decided to move up there.  We or she?  She made the decision.  Well, let's just put it this way.  After a few hours, we decided, after a few hours, to move up there. 
[00:40:30]  You're not learning anything.  It's a nice space for me.  Okay.  I'm over here now.  You're way over there now.  You're way over there.  You're way over there now.  We're over here.  You're way over there.  We're over here now.  You've got to be closer to where we're at.  You can't be over there when we're over here.  Spaz, this is, you know what this is?  It's a sign from our Lord Jesus Christ.  The Lord is telling you, you can't move over there. 
[00:41:00]  You've got to go over here now.  Ponderous.  F-ing ponderous.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I'm over here now.  Oh, wow.  See, this is a sign.  It wasn't good for you to move over there.  So now you have to look for a place that is in the same time zone as the station.  You shouldn't have to reset your watch as you drive to work. 
[00:41:30]  Spaz, you're nuts.  You're going to be on four trains every day.  What state are you closest to?  You're going to be useless to us.  You're closer to Connecticut, I believe.  Yeah, we're near the Connecticut-New Jersey border type thing.  Oh, my.  You know, like the border, like.  I know what he's talking about.  That's way the half up there.  Wait a minute.  Wait, no, no.  It's on the new Spaz map, the Connecticut-Jersey border. 
[00:42:00]  I know what he's trying to say, but it's looking way up there.  It's right on the Texas-Montana border.  It's so good.  Oh, my.  Dude, we're just stupefied again, man.  You just.  It's a hop, skip, and a jump from Trenton and San Francisco.  And you're not even in the place, so you're living out of a U-Haul truck in seedy hotels right now. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, it's very embarrassing.  Wow.  Spaz, man.  What are you doing?  You can't move there.  You know what that commute is going to cost you per week?  Did you figure that out?  I haven't been to the train station to figure out the price yet.  Somebody could probably figure it out.  Yeah, tell us.  Somebody's train savvy.  Yeah, tell us the train.  Tell us the train.  There's a lot of commuters out there that could do some quick figuring for you.  A short line, a path, and regular subway. 
[00:43:00]  Well, a regular subway, obviously, $1.50.  $60 a month for the MTA.  $60 a month for the MTA.  Roughly.  The path's what?  Another buck each time.  Buck each way.  So that's another person.  No, $60.  That's another $60 a month.  We're talking $1.20.  What?  I was originally paying $125 per month to ride the metro.  Oh, we're only up to $120.  You haven't even tried the other train.  It's got to be close to $200.  Wow.  Easily.  A month.  It's got to be.  It's got to be.  That's going to hurt.  Spaz, why don't you get something close? 
[00:43:30]  I can't.  Why not?  Why?  Does Erica have a car?  Yes.  Oh!  No!  I am!  So...  I am!  I am!  I am!  People just get...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Stupid!  I don't get it.  What's your name? 
[00:44:00]  She's got a car!  Throwing stuff at her.  And she's only going to drive 15 minutes!  She's got a car.  Her commute is 15 minutes with the car.  You're on a train for hours on end spending hundreds of dollars for this commute.  And it was a mutual decision?  Four hours a day!  And she pays nothing for the commute.  How was this decided upon?  How did she...  You don't learn anything.  Spaz. 
[00:44:30]  How did you both come up that this was the best thing?  She told me it was.  Yeah.  I really don't know.  I just thought it...  It just sounded...  I don't know.  It sounded good?  It sounded good for you to commute like four hours a day?  Spaz, you're being a doormat, man.  I didn't think it would be that bad.  It sounded good for me to commute four hours a day and she commutes a total of a half hour a day.  I just want her to be happy.  I'll move to where she's a mystery food server.  I'll move hours away from my, hopefully, a career. 
[00:45:00]  That's still to be determined.  Your finances are in a tizzy right now, yet you're going to shell out hundreds of dollars just to commute.  Right.  Where she has a car where if you moved here and she got another job in the food serving industry,  she could probably find a job so close where she could commute with her car very easily.  I don't understand.  This is totally against you. 
[00:45:30]  I want her to be happy.  It's important to...  Well, Spaz, that's very noble of you, but I'll tell you something.  There's a line between making someone happy and being a doormat.  I'm not a doormat.  You're being a doormat.  How else do you...  How else do you feel?  I don't say yes, dear, every time.  I put my foot down on things.  Oh, you put your foot down.  Like what?  Not on the gas pedal of her car to drive to work. 
[00:46:00]  Like what?  Because there's give and takes in all relationships.  So you gave in to this one for...  For what?  Well, like, I get to choose what we eat for dinner sometimes.  Oh, sometimes?  And even that is a sometimes.  Where we go, what movie we're going to see, sometimes I get to choose what movie...  The big decisions in life.  You should have those decisions anyway.  Those decisions are just like, you know, whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah, in a relationship, you know.  You get to choose some things. 
[00:46:30]  But not where you live and how you get to work.  No.  Well, it was a mutual to be both...  How is it mutual?  What side of the argument did you have that it was mutual?  It was a change of pace from where I was living.  Anything could be a change of pace.  It's a big city.  You can move...  You don't have to move...  To another area and have a change of pace.  You don't have to move to another state to have a change of pace.  You can move to the next town over.  It puts a bigger smile on her face to be up there.  And that's...  That's...  That's important to me. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  All right.  She's near her family and her friends and...  It's important.  It's important to her, so it's important to me.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm on the doormat.  I'm just...  Spaz.  The way this is sounding, it's sounding like you are doing something that really isn't in your best interest.  I'm not saying it is or it isn't.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying it sounds like you're doing something that even you know is not in your best interest. 
[00:47:30]  Well, I'll find it out when I take the commute for the first time.  Let us know how long it is.  Well, now, if you...  This is all a moot point if you can't get this place.  Oh, yeah, because I don't even know where I'm living yet.  Now, if you can't get this place, are you going to look for something maybe closer?  Yeah.  After having a little more time to think this out?  Yeah, you guys should talk about it again.  Maybe say, okay, look, I gave it a try.  Yeah, this might be a little crazy.  It'll work out.  But let's move maybe 20 minutes closer to the city. 
[00:48:00]  You're still kind of close to your family and friends.  And my commute won't be as bad.  I guess we can do that.  At least, you know...  Move into my building.  Regis.  I live over there on Amsterdam.  It's a wonderful community up there.  A lot of celebrities in the building.  All right, Spaz.  Well, let us know if you get this place.  But in the meantime, Spaz is living out of a U-Haul truck and city hotel rooms.  Motel rooms.  How much is the hotel a night?  $100. 
[00:48:30]  $100, $45 a day for the U-Haul.  Plus tax.  Plus tax.  Now, how long are you going to just wait with your stuff in the U-Haul before you hear something?  Are you going to wait until you hear something from them?  Or are you going to make a concerted effort to find a place?  I'm making calls.  Realtors are making calls.  This is one realtor that's being really great.  Yeah.  So, she's just having a problem with other people that are trying to get my apartment. 
[00:49:00]  Spaz, you're watching your U-Haul every night, right?  Oh, that's the one I'm just waiting for.  I'm being totally honest.  It's big, you know.  There's criminals out there.  That's all they do is find U-Hauls.  Breaking U-Hauls and steal.  From people that are moving into the area for the first time or whatever.  I have a bicycle combination lock.  Oh, well.  Holy.  There's nothing.  Nothing gets through those, Opie.  Spaz, don't be stupid.  I guarantee within a couple days, all your stuff's gone. 
[00:49:30]  Is it parked at the hotel?  This isn't even a bit anymore.  It's parked at the hotel.  Yeah, that's like the stomping ground of people that rip off U-Hauls or hotels because they know it's people that are traveling.  There's always the story on the news of the person that's moving into the area for the first time.  They left the U-Haul.  They retired.  They went into a motel room.  How big?  And the next day, the U-Haul is either gone or they just take your stuff right there in the parking lot.  How big a truck?  It's a 14-inch truck.  14-inch truck.  It's a very small truck, Opie. 
[00:50:00]  14-inch truck.  It's a 14-inch truck?  It's a 14-inch truck.  What do you got, your Barbie clothes in there?  No, no.  It's a 14-foot.  Oh, 14.  It's a 14-inch truck.  It's a 14-inch truck.  Okay.  A 14-foot truck.  And does it have doors on the side or just one in the back?  Yeah, one in the back.  And the place is not even New York Place.  Okay.  And now...  Well, no, don't give it...  You know what?  This isn't a bit.  Don't give out details.  Now, how do you park this vehicle? 
[00:50:30]  Do you park it with the door against a wall?  No.  That would be stupid.  Why would that be stupid?  Why?  That way they can't get into the back.  I've got to get into it every morning.  Well, you move it.  Oh, my God.  You move it up and get into it or else it's not going to be anything.  Whenever you have a U-Haul truck or something and you're going to be leaving it for any time,  you find a wall or something and you back the thing flat up against it so no one can get  to the back door.  That's like your first line of defense.  I should do that, then.  That's a good, good thing to do. 
[00:51:00]  It's a 14-inch truck.  Thank you, Spaz.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  The emails.  I can't even read these.  We can't even read them.  This isn't even a bit.  Yeah, this is not even a bit.  You're going to lose your stuff.  Do you realize that?  I don't want to make you paranoid, but maybe that will make you wake up.  If you're not getting a place for a while and you're going to be living out of this U-Haul,  somebody is going to take the chance of getting your stuff. 
[00:51:30]  People do this for a living.  There's criminals out there that do this for a living.  Not to make you paranoid, but the stories are all over the news all the time.  Where should I park it, then?  Against the wall.  Against the wall.  Would help.  That's not a...  I'd get a better lock.  ...thing, but...  Oh, my God.  Spaz, everyone's just saying, doormat, doormat.  Anthony, I like the articulation of moot point as opposed to Spaz's. 
[00:52:00]  It didn't sound like a Jew point.  I wasn't even trying.  Well, there he goes.  Spaz is moving on up, Anthony.  Moving on up to, it looks like Connecticut or Chicago.  I don't know where the hell.  Somewhere up there.  But he's moving on up.  Yeah, we're moving on up.  We're moving on up.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  We're moving on up to the side. 
[00:52:30]  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  We got a piece of the pie.  Whoa!  Spits don't fry in the kitchen.  Whoa!  The beans don't burn on the grill.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Took that whole lot of crying.  Just to get up that hill.  Okay, terrific.  We're moving on up in the big leagues.  Get now turn it down.  Whoa!  Slow and sweet lips.  You and me, baby.  Ain't nothing wrong with us.  For we're moving on up.  Come over here now. 
[00:53:00]  Okay, terrific.  How'd you like to go by long?  Huh?  Come over here now.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha!  Ha!  It's...  Stupid child who started it with Anya McBee Naughton.  Whoa, whoa!  Don't know why we keep him with the troubles of Anya Kors.  Hey!  Moms are fun with brain damage and thought runs is on pause. 
[00:53:30]  Hey!  Stupid child who started it with Anya McBee Naughton.  Whoa!  It's a little idiot and a dumb little guy.  Whoa!  It's a little idiot and a dumb little guy.  They call him Gavin K. Dog Spaz when he picks up the phone.  Don't expect an answer, Kors, his brain cells are off loan.  How'd he get his job with Owen A?  Well, I don't know.  He's the biggest turd you ever heard on New York Radio.  Whoa!  Stupid child who started it with Anya McBee Naughton.  Whoa!  Don't know why we keep him with the troubles of Anya Kors.  Whoa!  Moms are fun with brain damage and thought runs is on pause.  Hey!  Stupid child who started it with Anya McBee Naughton. 
[00:54:00]  Dumb little idiot and a dumb little guy.  Dumb little idiot and a dumb little guy.  Whoa!  Dumb little idiot and a dumb little guy.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Feedback coming in like crazy.  Michael from Manhattan writes,  Oh, and hey, my girlfriend lives right next to Orange County,  and I live in the city.  We have a hard enough time seeing each other on the weekends.  I think Spaz has a tumor.  Wow, Tom Brokenjaw checking in from NBC Nightly News on the instant feedback.  This just in, giant mosquito seen carrying a 14-inch U-Haul. 
[00:54:30]  That's pretty good.  Katie wants to tell everyone from Jersey,  make sure to remind the girls not to wear a dress tomorrow.  I wore one last Wednesday.  It is impossible to wow if you're wearing a dress.  Yeah, dress appropriately.  Definitely. Make it easily accessible.  Anthony, speaking of wow, we have another wow sticker stop today.  Pretty much every day we're going to be doing this.  We're going to be trying to hit all the areas that listen to the O&A show.  Today, right about now, they should be arriving. 
[00:55:00]  Black Earl should be arriving at Fidelity Diamond, Route 17 South in Paramus, New Jersey.  He should be there for at least an hour handing out wow stickers.  So if you're in the area, stop by and see Earl, okay?  Cool.  And we've got to talk about Fidelity Diamond right now, Anthony.  Yes, I'll see.  If you want to enter the wonderful world of holy matrimony.  Wait a minute.  Oh, God, man, that's funny. 
[00:55:30]  Well, if you want to make the plunge.  And is this part of your settlement that you have to read these libraries?  Sorry.  Yeah.  If you're going to make the plunge, you might as well do one thing, right?  Huh.  If you're going to go on to make the biggest mistake of your life, you might as well do something, right?  Torture!  That's torture!  Yeah.  Fidelity Diamond.  Yes.  The engagement ring specialists. 
[00:56:00]  And why are they the engagement ring specialists?  Well, L.P., they make sure you get the best buy.  Mm-hmm.  They educate you about diamonds.  It's going to be one of the biggest investments you make in your life.  And you're going to want to know a little bit about diamonds.  You can't just go to the department store and pick one out that's already set.  You don't know what the bottom of it looks like.  These people, you pick your own diamond out at Fidelity Diamond.  You pick the setting.  You watch them mount it.  They don't watch you mount the white.  I was like, okay, yeah, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, okay. 
[00:56:30]  It's Wade and Seth.  While you watch, they educate you about diamonds, Opie.  Mm-hmm.  Fidelity Diamond.  We've had a bunch of listeners go there, and they said, you know, the one thing about going to Fidelity Diamond,  you walk out of the place, and you really feel like you got a good deal, and you're convinced you didn't get ripped off,  which is really, really important.  And then you're on the road to happiness.  There you go.  Because you're spending an S-load of money on this, and you should make sure it's done right.  Right, Anthony?  Gotcha!  All right.  Give Tom Colosino a call, president of Fidelity Diamond, for a confidential appointment at 201-261-6555. 
[00:57:00]  That's 201-261-6555.  Or if you're in the area, you can stop by right now, get your WOW sticker, and say hi to Tom and the gang, okay?  All right.  They're located on Route 17 South in Paramus.  The WOW van should be there right now with Black Earl handing out the WOW stickers, okay?  Fidelity Diamond, give them a call, 201-261-6555.  All systems are over.  If you don't have any self-respect, aren't you embarrassed to yourself or your family?  Open your hands, Anthony. 
[00:57:30]  Kill in human slime!  1027-WNEW.  Ah, the listener's coming up with some good stuff today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Mike from Brooklyn on the instant feedback.  Anthony doing a live read for Fidelity Diamond is almost as bad as Psycho Mark doing a live  read for anti-drug and alcohol.  Yeah, that's true.  I get mad.  Well, we have our daily problem, Anthony.  Yeah.  Kathy will explain.  Kathy, what's going on? 
[00:58:00]  Well, I brought my 17-year-old son over to get his WOW stickers.  It's his birthday today.  Happy birthday.  So I thought I'd be a good mom and do this, but there's a guy that has a store next door  to this jewelry place, and he wants to tow everybody's cars.  And I think every panel truck in New Jersey is towing in his driveway.  Wow.  And we don't see Earl.  We're hoping he's better at driving than dating, so.  Well, we told you guys Earl would get lost. 
[00:58:30]  He gets lost wherever he drives that stupid van.  He was supposed to be there at four.  Obviously, he's late.  Probably lost.  Earl, if you're listening to us, give us a call and tell us, you know, how far away you  are from Fidelity Diamond with the WOW stickers.  That would help a lot.  Oh, oh, help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Help me!  That's it.  I hope someone does.  All right, Kathy, thank you.  Okay, thanks.  That's actual audio of Earl in the van trying to find Fidelity Diamond.  Earl, from the road.  100 people at Fidelity Diamond, where the hell is Earl? 
[00:59:00]  Now people are getting pissed.  David, what's going on?  Hey, man, you've got, look, 100 people over here waiting for Earl.  Where is he?  Well, we told you.  The guy doesn't know how to drive.  He gets lost wherever he goes.  Of course he's lost somewhere.  Man, hey, how about telling some of these girls to send us some whales here while we're waiting?  Yeah.  Driving south on 17.  Yeah, if you're driving past Fidelity Diamond, there's a bunch of WOW supporters waiting to get their stickers.  Ladies, why don't you give them a quick flash on the way by Fidelity Diamond, okay? 
[00:59:30]  Thank you, David.  All right.  All right.  Earl doesn't want to be on the air.  What?  Go find out what he wants.  He's lost somewhere.  I guarantee he's lost again, Anthony.  Yeah, of course.  Dave, what's going on?  He gets on the air.  Listen, there's a big banner on the northern state, a WOW banner hanging off in a bridge by Post Avenue.  Oh, we love that.  The WOW virus starting to spread, Anthony.  It's like a king-sized sheet.  Just give this a few weeks.  You're not going to believe what you see out there.  Listen, I have a small plane. 
[01:00:00]  I was wondering if I could drop some stickers for you.  That's a good idea.  I think that's against the FAA regulations.  Yeah.  They don't know the name of my plan.  Well, we appreciate the support, but we'll get the stickers out there.  Syndication underground.  Yes.  Thank you, Dave.  Later.  All right.  Earl's calling back.  Is he going to go on the air with us?  He better.  He better is right.  This is only done on the air.  Okay.  Here we go.  What?  Earl.  He won't go on the air.  He's afraid.  Earl.  Why won't he go on the air?  Ben, what's going on? 
[01:00:30]  Did he talk to him off there?  Earl keeps hanging up because he's afraid you guys are going to yell at him.  I guess it's because he got lost.  I don't know.  What is he, an idiot?  Get him on the frigging phone and tell him he's coming on the air.  Earl.  Just get Earl.  Call the damn radio show.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  There's Earl lost in a white neighborhood.  What is wrong with him?  He must have gotten so pissed when he finally realized he was lost.  Why would he get...  Why...  We're not going to get mad at him. 
[01:01:00]  He gets lost every time.  We know that's going to happen when we send him out.  Come on, Magellan.  Call in.  Jesus.  Earl should be calling any second.  Un-effing believable.  The cast of characters we have on this show.  Oh, my God.  Somebody making a suggestion for Spaz.  And what's that?  Instead of going out to the U-Haul for a close every morning.  Spaz, you're going to be there a few days.  Get a few clothes out and bring it into the hotel. 
[01:01:30]  You know what he's like?  You ever see that Bugs Bunny where Yosemite Sam keeps going back to the ship for one match?  One match, yeah.  To cook Bugs.  And he strikes the match and goes to light the wood and Bugs blows it out.  Oh, now I've got to go back to the ship and get another match, you varmint.  And the shark keeps nipping at him.  You fin-flapping flounder.  Hammer-headed halibut.  Shovel-nosed mackerel.  That's what Spaz is like.  I love cartoon voices.  Ben.  I believe Rick is trying to get Earl to talk to us.  He will not talk to us. 
[01:02:00]  Some reason.  No, that's unacceptable.  Tell Earl, if he doesn't come on the air with us, we will get him fired.  Yeah, we have the power.  We do have power around here.  What is it?  He's lost somewhere.  This is...  Rick's out there talking to him.  I know.  This is what we have to deal with every freaking day.  I won't go on the air.  He's a big celebrity, Earl.  We told everyone he would get lost.  Of course.  He got lost again.  It's not even hard.  It's the bridge.  Oh, Lord, he knows.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying. 
[01:02:30]  Do what he's saying.  Is Rick getting anywhere with him, Ben?  He's just yelling.  Rick's just yelling?  Of course he's going to yell.  Torture!  Ben's torture!  It is torture.  Come on.  Jesus, man.  I think we got audio of Earl lost somewhere in Jersey, Anthony.  I'm over here now.  Yeah, but Earl, you got to tell us where you are so the people can get their wow stickers. 
[01:03:00]  I'm over here now.  All right.  Let's see.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, come on, man.  What's the matter?  You can't find Fidelity Diamond?  I'm not driving.  Well, who is?  Tony Bloomfield's driving.  What's up?  I'm doing good for the long way.  All right.  So...  Some guy's yelling at me in the van.  I'm on track right now.  I love that. 
[01:03:30]  The listeners have found the wow van.  They're just yelling at you.  They're just pummeling me.  Why don't you get, like, a police escort to Fidelity Diamond or something?  How far are you?  We are not lost.  All right.  Somebody is saying they just spotted the wow van at the tunnel.  Why aren't you taking the tunnel?  We told you to take the bridge today.  We're not taking the tunnel.  We're on 17 now.  You're on 17 South.  How far are you from Fidelity Diamond?  Ten minutes tops.  Ten minutes tops.  Yes.  You sure?  Yes. 
[01:04:00]  All right, Earl.  Have you passed Red Lobster?  Actually, we're approaching it now.  Red Lobster.  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Help me!  God bless Cleveland Little.  All right.  Well, Earl, you have a lot of fans at Fidelity Diamond.  They're patiently waiting.  Yeah, we're anxious to get there.  They're patiently waiting for their wow stickers.  Route 17, South Paramus, New Jersey. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, we'll be there in a few minutes.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  How long ago did you leave?  I know.  Call us when you get there.  We've had so much hell getting out of the city.  Yeah?  That's the God's honest truth.  All right.  Next time you call the radio show, you're going to want to turn down your radio, okay?  I didn't turn it up.  I'm talking to you.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  Okay.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  All right.  Let's go to Manny real fast.  Manny, what's going on?  Manny?  Yo.  What's up, Manny?  Hey, man.  It's all an ongoing bit, man, to make our brothers look stupid, man. 
[01:05:00]  How hard is it, man, to get wow stickers to the listeners, man?  That's it.  It's not a tough job, right, Manny?  He makes good money, man.  I'm sure a thousand listeners out there could do that, man.  He's bitching and complaining every day.  Yeah.  All he has to do is open up envelopes and put a wow sticker in the self-addressed stamped envelope  and send it off to the mail.  He's bitching about that.  He can't find Fidelity Diamond today.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, hey.  What's the part?  Hey, this is Black Manny, the angry Black Manny. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  We know Manny.  How are you, buddy?  Is this an ongoing bitch, fellas?  Let me know, man.  It's a lot of listeners that want to know, man.  Is Earl for real or not, man?  Manny?  Manny, you met the man, the myth, the legend, Black Earl.  The whitest black man.  Do you think it's a bit, Manny?  He's the whitest black man I ever met in my life.  And what makes it worse than that, he always wears black.  Yeah.  That's why we call him Black Earl.  Well, guys, that's it.  He's doing a hell of a job.  All right.  Thanks, Manny.  I don't have a wow sticker. 
[01:06:00]  I don't think brothers get wowed anyway, but it's all good.  All right.  Cool.  All right, fellas.  Later, Manny.  Come by and see us soon, all right?  No doubt, baby.  All right.  What's up, Psycho Mark?  What's the problem?  Well, Ben wants me to tell you how Earl hands out wow stickers.  How does he hand them out?  Very slow.  Oh, really?  He's busy talking to, like, five people while there's, like, five cars backing up traffic,  and he's just sitting there, babble, babble, babble, babble. 
[01:06:30]  Here you go.  Here's a sticker.  Here you go.  And he'll hand out one or two.  Rather than four or five.  He's the tortoise, Anthony.  Ouch.  In the Bugs Bunny cartoon, he's the tortoise.  Here's your sticker.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Here's your wall sticker. 
[01:07:00]  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  All right.  Well, we got that mess going on, but they should be there soon.  If you're listening to this.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Audio of Earl.  Taken today.  Yeah.  The job's getting to him.  He can't open all the envelopes that have the self-addressed stamped envelopes for the  wow stickers. 
[01:07:30]  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, Jesus.  Stop that chink.  A day's pay for napping on the job.  Yes, sir.  Goddamn blazing saddles, man.  I told you boys to build a railroad, not jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots.  Okay, Mr. Taggart. 
[01:08:00]  I can't read that.  What in the wide, wide world of sports is going on here?  But you use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  Slim Pickens is a genius.  All right, Ann, we've got to take a break.  Real fast, Mike P. from Hoboken.  Hey, Toxic Twins, I'm stuck here at work, and every once in a while, I look at the Indian  message board you talked about yesterday.  We fans can do much better.  Please give out the address again.  And the address is www.indolink.com, right? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Is it Indolink?  Indialink.  Indialink.com.  This guy had it wrong.  Indialink.com.  And you go to the forums section.  Yeah, Steve from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website has the link on his page, too.  All right.  I was laughing so hard last night.  I went online and started reading through some of these.  No, no second, Mark.  It's not dothead.com.  Well, Anthony, let's take a break, and you brought in some of the messages that were 
[01:09:00]  left on the message board.  It is, I was laughing my ass off.  Our listeners are funny as mother effers, but the people on this message board that were  responding to our listeners cannot speak English.  The terminology they're using is classic.  I printed out a few.  They're really funny.  All right, we'll explain the whole thing next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Other debauchery on the way.  Stay there.  1-0-2-7-WNEW. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, Amy, real fast.  We're in the middle of a break here.  What's going on?  Are you talking to me?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I'm on Route 17 South right now, and there's a ton of traffic.  Really?  Yeah.  So it's not all his fault.  It's not all Earl's fault.  He should be there any moment now.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Amy.  No problem.  A lot of people saying, like, it's a parking lot.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Route 17 is a freaking parking lot, man.  I'm telling you, there's cops all over the place. 
[01:10:00]  There's a bunch of people in front of the place.  And now there's tow trucks coming.  I don't know what's going on with the tow trucks, but I see three of them right now.  All right.  And there's a whole bunch of people in front of the place right now.  Oh, cool.  This is great.  You guys are awesome.  Well, you guys kick butt, bro.  Any ladies driving, you know, Route 17 South near Fidelity Diamond, give the gang a flash  as you drive by.  Yeah.  They've been waiting a long time for Black Earl to show up, so.  Well, thank you, Nick.  All right.  No problem, guys.  All right, man.  Let's go to Chris real fast, and then we've got to get back into the commercials here. 
[01:10:30]  Chris, what's going on?  Yo, all right.  I live in Anglewood right by Route 17, and the trucks are going, like, really, really  slow.  It's painfully slow.  There's no way he's getting there in 10 minutes.  All right.  Well, Earl will check in with us in a little while, but thank you for that, Chris.  Okay.  Syndication on the ground.  Yes.  Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  Yes.  I love Rockaway Bedding.  Our own spaz should use Rockaway Bedding, but he doesn't know where to deliver it.  Maybe that's his problem.  Well, Rockaway Bedding, 130 stores throughout New York and New Jersey.

[01:12:00]  It's going on a show 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We have more fun when the commercials play than live on the radio.  Plenty of junk going on in here.  Well, Anthony, the show is at a standstill right now because everyone's just freaking out.  They're waiting for Earl to arrive at Fidelity Diamond, Route 17 South for Ames, New Jersey.  Billy supposedly is right behind the WOW van.  Billy.  Yo, it's Chuck and Bill. 
[01:12:30]  I told you before about the WOW.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  Those guys were so full of crap, they were pulling your leg.  I just let them in in front of me.  I'm on the phone with you.  They're right in front of me right now.  I'm escorting them in.  Well, actually, I'm following them in.  Okay.  We're just at the Route 417 interchange.  So how far is that from Fidelity?  I'd say about a good 15, 20 minutes with the traffic.  Come on.  I'm telling you, he's waving at me now.  Is he really?  Yes, he is.  See, Earl's a liar. 
[01:13:00]  He's got a handful of stickers, so.  Earl's a liar.  He was telling us a few minutes ago, oh, I'm only 10 minutes from the place.  I'll be there real soon.  Full of crap.  Full of crap.  All right, Billy.  Thank you for that update.  All right, boss.  Now people are just following the wow van to the Fidelity Diamond, Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, it's the best way to get Earl there.  Talk him in.  Everyone is just screaming on the phone lines.  They got their car phones.  Where's Earl?  When will he be here?  All right, Anthony.  Let's get into the enemy of the show. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  This pops up from time to time.  We're trying to do this politically incorrect show, and from time to time, we get the organizations  and people that are just so pissed off, and they get all their people together to attack  this fine radio program, right, Anthony?  Yeah, of course.  So we have decided, you know, instead of just sitting there and taking it like a lot of  other jocks do, we have decided, you know what, we have an army ourselves, we'll attack  back.  Yeah.  And you never want to be an enemy of the show, right?  No, no.  Okay.  Enemy of the show.  It's just not a good thing. 
[01:14:00]  No.  We have the latest enemy of the show, this poor little message board.  Sorry, I was distracted by what?  Psycho Marks, one of Psycho Marks' favorite websites, I guess, airdisaster.com.  You are a sick piece of work.  You're showing me, like, pictures of aircraft that are just in positions they should not be  in.  But there's one just sideways, and another one on fire coming in.  They have, like, footage and stuff of the place. 
[01:14:30]  Greg, I've got video ones and voice recordings.  And what, they send you an email when there's a disaster?  Is that true?  They emailed me today.  There's a crash in Africa and in Tibi, Africa, and a DC-10 just crashed.  Not that anyone's going to care.  So if you're part of airdisaster.com, you give them your email and stuff, they will email  you every time there's a plane crash.  They email you every time there's a plane crash.  If it's one in Africa, it probably was one of those Flintstone planes made out of a pterodactyl  with a log on its back.  Airdisaster.com. 
[01:15:00]  That's all right.  All right.  So tell Earl to hang up.  He keeps calling the show.  Yeah, we've had it with it.  Earl.  Earl, stop calling the show and get to fiddle.  Thank you.  Oh, now he's hanging up.  Okay.  Anyway, Anthony, enemy of the show.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  We have a microphone in the wow van and every time we pot it up, it's Earl just freaking 
[01:15:30]  out.  He can't find the damn place.  Losing his mind.  Okay.  Anthony, yes.  Enemy of the show.  Yeah.  Well, it turns out, remember about, what was that, about two months ago?  Yeah.  Three months ago or so.  I called a car service because my truck was being worked on and I had a lot of problems  getting a car.  It took four hours of me standing on 57 with my cell phone in my hand, yelling at the dispatcher  saying, he's not here.  Where is he?  And the guy in the car telling the dispatcher, I'm right here waiting. 
[01:16:00]  Like, no, he's not.  And I was so pissed.  So I went on the next day and just unloaded.  Well, the car finally showed up four hours later.  This is key to the story.  Yeah, yeah.  And you were so pissed off.  Anthony doesn't really get that pissed off in public anyway.  But you were so pissed off, the guy decided that he was not going to drive you.  Yeah, I threw my bag in the back of the car.  I slammed the door.  I'm like, well, thanks for showing up.  And he's like, get out of my car.  Get out of my car.  Right.  I said, no, you're taking me home.  You mother. 
[01:16:30]  So after all that, you came in the next day livid.  Yeah.  And you decided that all Pakistanis must die.  Well, the Pakistani guy that was driving was a real obnoxious asswipe.  And we got on the phone with the dispatcher from the company.  And he said, yeah, this guy's just a jerk off.  So I kind of made a blanket statement that I can't stand all Pakistanis.  Which people do when they're just outraged.  They say stupid things and stuff.  And they're a...  Not that I need to explain for you, but I think we've all been there where you just yell at a whole race of people  because that one person cut you off in traffic. 
[01:17:00]  And I'm not saying that they're all like this.  I'm just saying a lot of them don't shower open.  It's kind of offensive to get next to some of these people that do not shower.  I heard that it's a sign of their manhood, their smell.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  Well, and you know, of course, there's some that shower.  I made a blanket statement and I don't care.  But this one woman on the indialink.com forum board just was livid. 
[01:17:30]  She, like, unleashed a holy war against us, Opie.  Yes, she did.  So we made the website and her an enemy of the show.  Which is just not good when that happens.  We don't break out an enemy of the show often.  But when we do, it gets ugly.  And our listeners responded.  Yes.  And, oh, my goodness gracious.  It's just good reading.  Yeah.  Besides being the enemy of the show, you check out some of the posts.  You'll laugh your butt off all night long reading this stuff. 
[01:18:00]  A lot of them just the title post.  You know, no real substance to it.  But a lot of appearances by Dice on the board last night just saying,  I'm over here now.  A few from Sylvester Stallone saying, hey, Pakistanian, crap on me.  There were, like every character, a lot of OK Terrifics.  And then a few letters that were actually pretty good we got from some listeners. 
[01:18:30]  But the response from our onslaught from the people that are on this board on a daily basis, unbelievable.  Take this one from Tipu.  Opie, Tipu.  I don't know what S you come from.  You have very wrong crowd to mess with.  That very soon are going to find if you don't stop your hooliganism here. 
[01:19:00]  Let this be first warning.  The administration can wipe all your hard work in a second.  Like you are only American, you son of unknown father, of which there is no birth record,  who just evolved from the waste of the East River.  What?  Wow.  So, uh, we got a few postings from guys after that letter that were just laughing their asses up. 
[01:19:30]  They're like, I'm laughing so hard because you don't understand English.  One of our fans wrote, kiss this message board goodbye.  The ONA listeners know what I'm talking about.  And, uh, boy, you guys struck.  How about this?  Um, make no mistake, no regret, I am already hacking your computers and will trace you to your home.  Yay, we have such capability.  We hacked into Pentagon. 
[01:20:00]  You are a piece of cake, so warn your buddies.  There is a gay waiting for you who hasn't had Yankees fan since New Year's Eve.  What?  Yeah, if you didn't get that, we have hacked into Pentagon.  You are a piece of cake.  So warn your buddies, there is a gay waiting for you who hasn't had Yankees fan since New Year's Eve.  Boo!  Boing, dang, bang, chang, flang. 
[01:20:30]  I'm just reading through some of these.  They are really funny.  Uh, and then after reading a few of these, this guy that, uh, is called OK Terrific, wrote, um,  I could go on reading what you write for days.  Doesn't mean it'll make any sense.  I'll tell you what.  Why don't you let the others respond to this?  Uh, at least they can type English.  You're typing gibberish.  All it's gonna do is give me a headache.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, and the woman that started this whole thing, uh, Shiksa Girl on this site, 
[01:21:00]  uh, she's being defended by some of the men on there.  Don't think she is alone.  If you want to make a statement about your O and E,  we will listen, but no crap and no harassment of ladies.  Let's see what you are terrific in.  Rational or stupidity.  Irrationality or immaturity.  I could go on describing you.  Exclamation point. 
[01:21:30]  Wait, dude.  Are you almost done?  I got one more.  All right, then read it, because this show's just a mess today.  I love when this show's a mess.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Read the last one.  Uh, last one from Tipu again.  Keep away from ladies.  First warning.  So it is about terrorizing one girl.  Shame on you, O and E.  You don't have guts to talk to real Indian who have conquered and cowed you all without war.  Incredible?  I think so.  What is he saying?  I don't know. 
[01:22:00]  And now the threat.  If you don't keep your talk to real men, you can expect a nuclear bomb on your hideout.  Yes, we have it, including our neighbor Pakistan.  I have heard you like it in their bed.  They make no sense.  It's very funny, but we are, uh, the Pakistanis are, uh, enemy of the show.  The Pakistani message board.  Indialink.com.  Their motto, we put the dot in dot head. 
[01:22:30]  Or we put the dot com in dot head.  Wow, people are starting to check it out, and they're laughing.  They're nuts off right now.  Some of the, uh, yeah, some of the, it's really good.  It's so funny, because they can't really speak English.  And there's only, like, before our listeners got there, there were, like, five people on this message board.  Yeah, there were, like, 15, uh, hits to this website.  It's hysterical.  Now there's hundreds upon hundreds.  Yeah.  So there you go.  What is it again?  What's the website?  India.  Indialink.com.  Go to the forum section.  And the unofficial site has the link.  www.foundrymusic.com. 
[01:23:00]  And I was laughing in the middle of that, because, uh, people just freaking out.  We can't give Earl the tough jobs anymore.  Listen to this.  You're going to die.  How tough is this?  You're going to die.  Wait, uh, Nash, before you say anything, let me just tell everyone that, uh, uh, Earl is about 40 minutes late.  He's supposed to be at Fidelity Diamond.  It's the WOW sticker stop for today.  You can get the brand new WOW stickers at, uh, Fidelity Diamond, Route 17, South Paramus.  Nash, Nash, you got an update.  What is it?  Hey, we just saw Earl driving northbound about 10 minutes away from the place. 
[01:23:30]  He's going to be another half an hour, because he's going to be sitting in the traffic that we were just sitting in.  Oh, oh, oh, help me, help me, help me, somebody help me, help me, help me.  Well, there's, uh, actual audio of Earl trying to figure, uh, figure out where the hell Fidelity Diamond is happening.  Oh, oh, oh, help me.  Let's, uh, let's, uh, let's go to Dave.  Dave, what's going on?  Going on, excuse me. 
[01:24:00]  It's kept on going.  We all honked.  Everybody's going nuts out here.  We got WOW signs.  How can he miss a place where there's people honking?  There's a crowd.  You can't just turn into the place.  He's got to find a U-turn.  He's got to find, on any side street off the 17, it says U-turn.  All right, Dave, thank you.  No problem.  All right, so we're getting reports that Earl is going the wrong way.  Oh, oh, help me, help me, help me. 
[01:24:30]  Somebody help me, help me, help me.  And you and I should get an award for, uh, hiring all these damn retards.  Hiring the Handicap.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's, uh, let's, uh, go to Earl.  He's calling back.  Earl.  All right, so we're getting reports that Earl is going to go.  Yeah.  Turn down the effing radio, you stupid idiot.  Damn, man, drive it and turn it down.  So where are you, Earl?  We're about to pull in. 
[01:25:00]  You're about to pull in.  Yes.  There's at least a thousand people.  There's at least a thousand people there.  Oh.  I've seen signs with cranky ass.  I forgot the stickers.  That's terrific.  Yeah, people are bringing signs.  The last car was full of crap.  We're behind the youth.  I can't.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Don't do that.  All right.  All right.  As you can hear, the car is honking.  We're about to pull in, and we will give out a... 
[01:25:30]  I'm about to pull in.  A turn to the last second.  Earl, if you shut up, I'll hear all the cars honking.  So shut up for a second.  Wow, Ant, listen to all those cars.  He's not even here.  He's not even here.  Earl, you lying piece of ass.  I'm not lying.  I don't hear one car honking.  What did you tell me to shut up?  I wanted to stop.  Well, that doesn't mean the car is a...  Jesus Christ.  Earl, where the hell are you? 
[01:26:00]  We're on track.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I guess I hear a few people honking now, Earl. 
[01:26:30]  Thank you.  The cab is in.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rick, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  All right.  Let's go to John.  The show has been halted once again.  John?  Yeah?  Where the hell is Earl?  I have no idea.  I'm on 17 right now.  Right in front of...  Go on.  Go on.  You put it...  Oh, man.  All right.  I had to hang up on you, man.  Your phone sucked.  Well, we're getting a bunch of people that are saying that. 
[01:27:00]  Reed, what's going on?  Yeah, he's full of crap.  We're all standing here in the parking lot, and he's nowhere near us.  He can't see him.  He's a lying sack.  He's a lying piece of crap.  It was 15 minutes ago.  You want to hear some people scream?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Yeah, see?  There you go.  That's some people.  Guys, I got some bad news for Earl.  Huh?  He's going to be the only black guy here.  What do you want to do here, Chris?  All right, Reed.  Thank you.  Very good. 
[01:27:30]  We got Earl back on the phone.  Okay, I'm here at Fidelity Diamond.  You can hear the crowd behind me.  Hello?  I'm handing out stickers now by the thousands of the people very joyous here and happy to  see me.  Oh, boy.  Take a left.  Take a left here.  I think it's around the corner.  Yes, they're so happy to get their wow sticker. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, brother.  All right, this guy has the wow van right in front of him.  Mark, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm right behind him, guy.  All right, and where is he?  All right, he's 17 Southbound.  He just cleared the Garden State Parkway, so he should be coming up on Fidelity in a minute.  What are you, a cop?  No.  Some guy.  I'm just a cop, so I'm waiting for them to raid the place.  All right, thank you, Mark.  All right, bye.  All right, this guy, Fred, has a sign.  Fred, what does your sign say?  There's a big sign over here that says, Earl, stop here. 
[01:28:30]  You got to talk him in.  He missed the sign.  I don't know where he is.  We're going to have a contest.  All right, well, thank you, Fred.  Okay.  We're going to have a contest.  What takes longer, for Earl to get to Fidelity Diamond or for Spaz to get to his new pad?  Yeah.  Anthony, I got Earl back on the phone.  All right.  Earl, where are you?  I'm over here now.  You tricked me there.  I'm over here now. 
[01:29:00]  No, that's Earl.  Where, Earl?  I'm over here now.  I don't know.  I seem to think he's in trouble.  I have him on the phone right here.  Yeah.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, Jim.  I guess they're pulling in.  Jim?  Oh, Jim.  That was, wow. 
[01:29:30]  We had the audio of Earl actually probably just passing the place again.  Earl.  Earl.  Yeah.  That phone's awful.  What?  Yeah, hi, Earl.  Yes.  What?  It looks like Earl has made it to Fidelity Diamond, Anthony.  We had a big, big terrific friend.  There's an over here now, son. 
[01:30:00]  I hung up on him.  His phone sucks.  His phone absolutely sucks.  What was at first a happy crowd waiting for their wow stickers has now turned into a lynch mob.  That's so right.  Oh, oh, help me.  My God, man.  All right.  I guess Earl has made it there, Anthony.  Yeah.  John?  You?  Is Earl there?  Hello?  Hey, John, you're on the radio.  Hey, I'm almost at Fidelity Diamond.  Okay.  I was on the George Washington Bridge when he said he was ten minutes away. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I know.  It looks like he finally has arrived, though.  Did you guys warn the cops about this?  There's a cop, like, every three feet.  Oh, really?  They got right before the parking lot, and they're blocking the lots.  Let's say hi to the Paramus Police Department.  They're my favorite police force.  What's that guy?  I don't think that'll help you.  They're ball busters.  All right, John.  Thank you.  No problem.  All right.  Well, we didn't know there was going to be a crowd.  We thought a few people would show up for their brand new wow sticker.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  These things are a hot commodity.  Yes, they are.  If you can't get to one of these sticker stops, we're doing them pretty much every day this week.  Yeah.  You know, you can send in the self-addressed stamp down below, or you could go to the participating Ranch One locations and pick up your stickers.  I want to talk to Earl again, but his phone sucks.  That phone blows.  Oh, he's on the phone.  Do we have him?  Yeah.  Hey, Earl.  I'm over here now.  Did I get you again in?  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  That is my favorite new clip.  How many people are going to start saying, I'm over here now?  I'm over here now.  The first time he said that to us last week, it didn't make any sense, but now it makes perfect sense.  Now I think it's really funny.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  All right.  Well, I'm having such trouble getting on India Link.  Well, because everyone is pounding it now.  I know.  I want to check it out.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  Earl Circle Paramus 20 times. 
[01:32:00]  Route 17 backed up for many miles.  I hope someone's snapping some pictures out there.  Yeah.  Snap some pictures for the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  We'd love to see the scene out there.  Okay?  All right, Anthony.  Let's take a break.  Let us do that, Opie.  Still lots of radio show to do today.  We are going to replay the dice call from yesterday because it was really, really weird.  I'm over here now.  He called in to thank us.  He said that Anthony and I have inspired him to move on with his career. 
[01:32:30]  He was dangerously close to sounding like a born-again Christian.  Yeah, but he gave us some really, really funny stuff.  Christ the Lord is my Savior over here.  See my heart?  Christ is over here now.  All right, and before we go to break, let's check in with Black Earl, live from Fidelity Diamond.  Earl!  I'm over here now! 
[01:33:00]  That's just like the OK Terrific.  It just doesn't get old.  I love it.  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Help me!  I'm on the Indialink.com forum board.  Yeah, enemy of the show.  Oh, my God!  Enemy of the show, yes.  From Dice, I'm over here now.  Yeah.  I'm dying over here.  I'm from Pharma. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Nigga Charlie.  F off.  Nigga Charlie checking in.  In Schicks' pants.  What a tool from Dr. Smith.  New game.  Let's make Schicks' a cry.  Formal apology from ONA.  And it's from Crap Weasel, so I'm sure it's sincere if I would have opened that one up.  Good job, guys.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  Goddamn.  All right.  I love this goddamn show. 
[01:34:00]  We'll be back.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We have 212-757-1027.  We're kind of in the middle of a commercial break here.  We'll talk for a couple minutes, then we've got to take a break, regroup, and get the show  back on track here, Anthony.  Phil is saying we shouldn't get mad at Earl for getting lost on his way to Fidelity Diamond.  No.  Think about the wow stickers.  Maybe Spaz gave him directions.  Paramus is right next to the Connecticut-South American-New Jersey border. 
[01:34:30]  We all know how complicated that area is.  That's pretty good.  Still to come on the show today, Anthony.  You know, we were going to play Stoner Spilling Beat, but now that we're a little too busy  now, we've got too much stuff to get to.  Yeah.  In a little while, we've got to talk about Evel Knievel.  He's endorsing a new product.  Yeah, wait until you hear what it is.  You're not going to believe it.  That's on the way.  Also, we're going to replay the Dice phone call from yesterday, because it was just a  very strange call, to say the least, Anthony. 
[01:35:00]  Where is Dice?  Oh, the Dice?  I'm over here, Dice?  Where's Dice?  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to get it up here on my little machine here.  Oh, I've got to get that over here.  I'm over here now!  There's Dice, Anthony.  He called us yesterday.  He said that, you know, last week when he called the show and he was going back and  forth with Jay Moore, he said, Ant and I have inspired him to move on with his career.  After that exchange with Jay Moore on our show last week, he went to the comedy clubs 
[01:35:30]  every night.  He's re-motivated.  He wasn't sure if he wanted to put out a CD, but after talking to us, he has decided,  what the hell, I'm going to go for it.  He's pumped for it.  I'm going to tour.  We were like his therapist yesterday.  Yeah.  It was really, really strange.  And it's definitely worth a replay.  We're going to do it sometime in the 5 o'clock hour, okay?  I mean, it was real serious in the beginning, and then he just made us laugh our asses off.  It was serious on his side.  We were just like, oh, my God. 
[01:36:00]  Well, yeah.  But then after that...  I'm crazy over here now.  Yeah.  Well, then after that, he decided to make us laugh really hard with the yam bags and  some classic dice.  The midgets and all sorts of stuff.  So if you missed it yesterday, it's definitely worth sticking around for.  That and the Evel Knievel on the way, okay?  Yeah.  And we've got to take a break.  But when we were doing our little ratings party last week at Privilege, ran into a few  people that asked me to play Hey, Masturbator on the show. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  Now, we haven't played it in a really long time, but this was our first hit, Anthony.  Yeah.  I remember this.  This was sent all over the country and...  It started getting sent back to us from people saying, hey, guys, check this out.  You ought to play it on your show.  Yeah, they thought Adam Sandler wrote this song.  Yeah, that was it.  We used to get the words emailed to us.  Yeah.  And said, by Adam Sandler.  Yeah.  What?  No, no.  Anthony wrote this damn song.  No, this isn't Adam Sandler. 
[01:37:00]  It's me.  It's the Masturbator song.  Well, we sent this out and stations all over the country played it.  Matter of fact, there's a bunch of morning shows right here in this fine city of ours  that played the song and made believe it was theirs.  Yeah, because we were in Boston at the time.  We were in Boston at the time.  Thought they were safe.  So we couldn't yell at them because no one would have heard us back then.  Yeah.  But no, this is our little ditty.  It's old now, but what the hell?  It was our first big hit.  A classic now.  It is a classic now.  Everyone remembers the Hey Macarena song. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, boy.  From a few years back.  Are they still doing that at weddings?  Hey Macarena?  Probably not.  I was at a wedding a month and a half ago.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my God.  They did that.  The electric slide.  Oh, yeah.  The chicken song.  The chicken dance.  Chicken dance, whatever.  Hands up.  Oh, yeah.  They do hands up.  The conga line into the kitchen.  Oh.  The electric slide.  You go to the weddings and you're just getting liquored up at a table watching the people  trying to do that on the dance floor. 
[01:38:00]  And you're just like.  The wedding is okay, though, if there's at least one real hottie to watch dancing around.  And it's wearing something really skimpy and she's dancing.  You're just waiting for a boob to fall out.  No, but it makes it all worthwhile being there.  But instead of seeing that, it's usually like, you know, your aunt acting like she's still cool or your uncle.  Hey, I'm cool.  I can do the electric slide.  Oh, great.  What a smelly chick.  I'm not.  I'm only going to.  That's funny.  I'm only going to receptions.  Huh? 
[01:38:30]  I'm only going to receptions these days.  I don't care who it is.  Like if I get an invite to a wedding, I will not show up at the church and do that.  I have just as most people will never show up and watch a public execution.  I will never go to a church and watch anybody.  I'll probably get more people at that.  It's a lot less painful.  Is that true?  Time Warner and Disney and their cable dispute.  Thank God.  There you go.  People missed out on Celebrity Millionaire.  ABC television will shortly be back on the air in 3.5 million cable homes. 
[01:39:00]  There you go.  You got your ABC back, people.  How did Millionaire locally get like a 25 share last night?  They were number one, again, Millionaire locally in the overnights  without anyone being able to watch the show.  Yeah, that's a little weird.  I'm stunned.  Well, I got it on Long Island.  Yeah.  David Duchovny?  Yeah.  Just not a nice guy.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Regis was joking with him and stuff.  He just came across...  Well, he's a sarcastic kind of guy.  I know, but it went over the top where even Regis started feeling uncomfortable.  Like, is he joking or is he for real?  That's pretty funny, though.  I wish I would have seen that.  Any interviews I read with him, he seems like a pretty funny guy.  Yeah, he just didn't seem happy to be there.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe Regis is a prick.  You're going to sit in that hot seat.  I'm going to ask you questions.  You're going to answer them.

Ouch  I'm a raving lunatic  That's pretty loud, man  Okay, brother  Okay, brother  Ouch  Let's go to Brian real fast  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  How are you?  We're over here now 
[01:43:30]  I just want to let you know  I think I know why David Duchovny was a little bit upset on Regis the other day  Yeah, he just doesn't know on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  It doesn't seem like he's having fun like the rest of those  Yeah, I think it has to do with because his show is usually on the same time  And it's killing the ratings  Hey, that's a good point  Was that it?  The X-Files are on when  Yeah, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is pretty much up against everyone at this point  What's the watch that, though?  It's all the Midwestern rubes  I get bored real fast with the show 
[01:44:00]  Yeah  Because the first eight questions, it's like, oh, God  Why are we wasting  Drag it out  It's like, why are we wasting time?  Let's just get to the questions that you have to think a little bit  Is that your final answer?  Yeah  And has anyone ever went, uh, no  All right, let me change  Bless you  Bless you  You know?  Yeah  No one changes it  Do away with the, is that the final answer?  Go right into the next question  No, they've got to change camera angle  All dramatic  Next question  With that Planet of the Apes music that ends each show 
[01:44:30]  Yeah  Just stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape  That's your final answer  Hey, TJ, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I happened to catch out, check out Who Wants to Be a Millionaire last night  And do you hear Rosie in the background just making disgusting grunts and noises every time Dave Duchovny got an answer right?  Well, while she's eating  Yeah, she is  Sounded like she wanted a box of Twinkies every time 
[01:45:00]  She has a really annoying voice  And throughout the whole show, you're just hearing the background  Disgusting  With that high pit  I think that fat's clogging her brain  What, did she put beads in her hair or something?  What?  Does she have beads in her hair?  I don't know  I saw her on, um, some show  She was talking to Regis  About the whole thing of, uh, Channel 7 being taken off  She's doing what, the Bo Derek?  Yeah  That's just, uh, uh  I'm looking at, why would she say, put beads in my hair? 
[01:45:30]  Wah!  I'll look great  Know what's the best about the, the Bo Derek look?  I was on vacation in the Caribbean  Yeah  And a lot of people can relate to this  You get back to the rickety airport  Waiting for your flight back to New York  Yeah  And everyone else was down in the Caribbean  So they're pretty much buying the myth  You know, you're laying on the beach  And the, the bead girl comes by  Yeah  And you decide to look like Bo Derek  But you don't have the body of Bo Derek  Like, and all these people are in the, in the airport  With their hair done and the beads and stuff 
[01:46:00]  Well, laying on the beach is one thing  I know, it's like, you look completely ridiculous  Okay  Yeah, sure, maybe on the beach  While you're catching a tan  Having a Corona or whatever  You know, smoking a blunt  Okay, you're fitting in with the environment  Yeah  As soon as you touch down at JFK  People are just gonna openly laugh at you  Yeah, you're walking, uh, out to your car  And you have the beads on your, in your hair  Yeah  Oh, this looks ridiculous  It looks just stupid  I sit there in the airport  I just start laughing at myself  Just a, a really bad observation 
[01:46:30]  But it's  Okay, well, let's, uh, check back in with Earl here  Earl, what's going on?  Hey guys, as you can probably hear  We have, we have this, we have this  A lot of people now  I don't know if that's a watch sticker  And they're lining up the wrong  All right, Earl, Earl  Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl  Earl, yes  Don't scream into the phone  No one could hear you  I, I can't hear myself  You're over-modulating 
[01:47:00]  Speak like a human being  You, you sound like that guy in the train  That has to yell because he, he, he has the cell phone on  I'm just not sure if you can hear me or not  Oh, there you go  We can hear you much better  Now, Earl, what's going on at Fidelity Diamond?  Just about everyone is lined up along the route now  Just a little  Pretty much  The phone, the phone just about blows  All right, Earl  Thank you for that update  We really would love to, uh  Talk a little insight as to what's going on over there 
[01:47:30]  But the phone just blows  Yes  All right, let's go to Jeff real fast  Jeff, what's going on?  Jeff?  Yeah  Hey, what's up, buddy?  What about Kathy Lee with her booth starting at her waist?  On, on Millionaire last night?  I did see that  Yeah  I did see that  They basically started at her belly button  And then they go below her waist  It was really bad, man  Yeah  That must be the new look  Like Ann says, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh  Socks filled with sand 
[01:48:00]  Sweat socks full of sand  Yeah  Yeah  You know what?  Her boobs start so low down  That she probably has a chest just like a guy  You know, like the chest portion  And then the boobs start somewhere around  This, where the stomach meets the chest area  That's where her boobs start  Start  And then they hang down to her stomach  It was pretty much like on the old Saturday Night Live  When, uh, John Belushi  Used to have that thing around his waist  And it was like a little track  And there were metal balls 
[01:48:30]  That would roll, like, around the back  And up front  Yeah  The old lady  Yeah  I don't know, man  She, uh, she was pretty weak on there  I thought that, that she was pretty much like the worst guest  It was like Regis and Kathy Lee  And, uh, I don't know  She was like kind of lame  I couldn't wait for her to get off  And who's that kid?  Uh, I think he's like NSYNC, right?  Oh, he's one of the NSYNC dudes?  Yeah  He just looks completely  He's all baked on the show, isn't he?  Yeah, he looks just completely out of place  He's all baked in the background  His eyes are all crossed 
[01:49:00]  Nice fake, Opie, like you didn't know who it was  No, I, honestly, I didn't know  I, I don't know who's in NSYNC  And who's in the Backstreet Boys  I couldn't tell you  And all the other ones  I have no clue  If one of the blonde hosebags were up there  That sing these days  Oh, I would know  I would know  I would know  It's Britney Spears  Christina Aguilera or something  Or, uh, uh, Jennifer Simpson  Or whatever her name is  Yeah, I know all that  All right, well, thank you, Jeff  Okay  Peace  Let's go to Jake real fast  Jake, how are you today?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey  Hey, you were talking about weddings before? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  My gal dragged me to a, uh  Just one of these awful weddings  Out on Long Island this weekend  Where I knew nobody  Oh, those are always great fun  Sitting in a corner  Well, you know, the only thing you can  Which is during the cocktail hour  You drink as fast as you possibly can  That's it  So by the time we sit down  I'm pretty much out of my mind  And they do that song  Where the bride and groom dance  And sure enough  It's the, uh, the Titanic song  Oh  So as they're going on  Like, as it, like, I'm pretty ripped  And as it's getting to the chorus 
[01:50:00]  Like, all of a sudden  I found myself starting to, you know  Imitate you guys  And start singing it  And all of a sudden  Everyone, like, at the table  And a couple tables around me  Is looking at me  Because I'm screaming out the chorus  And everyone just looking at me  Like, what the hell  If my girl made me just  Go back out to the parking lot  Yeah, there's not a lot of survivors  Survivors  When you get married  No  Everyone will sink  Below the murky depths  Of the North Atlantic  It's all so nice 
[01:50:30]  I see her all right now  Oh, never mind  It's just squeaking out  Alright, Jake, thank you  Alright, guys, be good  Is this like the, uh  Yeah, this song must be used  A million times  For every last wedding  It's on for every wedding  These days, yes  It's so wonderful  Here it is  The first dance  As bride and groom  Out on the floor  Wonderful, isn't it?  Look at the lump  In their eyes  Just like, uh  When the Titanic set sail, right? 
[01:51:00]  Yes, wasn't it beautiful?  Yes, it looked very beautiful  Wonderful ship  The crystal chandelier  Over the grand staircase  Ah, yes  The wedding  Just like the Titanic  The gentle waves  Tapping against her bow  In the moonlight  Of course  And Jack and Rose  Right  Falling in love  On the decks  Of the mighty  That's right  Dreaming of the possibilities  Where  Dreaming of the possibilities  Of the  Of your life together 
[01:51:30]  Then  What  What happened  After  It was at sea  For a while  What happened  What happened  Suddenly  The waters  Got a little  Chopper  Yes  And a little  Colder  And less  Inviting  Yes  And then  Out of nowhere  Out of nowhere  A iceberg  Well, I like to think of it  As a black  Midget wrestler  Myself  Black midget wrestler  Thank you, guys  And then 
[01:52:00]  All of a sudden  The Titanic  Was just opened up  Water pouring in her  And in no time  She was sinking  Slipping beneath  The murky waters  Of the North Atlantic  Only  With marriage  There are no  Survivors  No  None whatsoever  Everyone  Perishes  Georgia  It's Georgia  Dance it up 
[01:52:30]  Dance it up  At your wedding  Hope you're having fun  How would you like  To blow my love  Marriage starts off  Just like the Titanic  And ends in disaster 
[01:53:00]  It was truly a disaster  I guess that's the song, huh?  Yeah, that's what they're saying, Anthony  That's good  Great  Anyway  We have to take a break here  In a few minutes  Oh  Well, we can do the  Evil Knievel real fast  Oh  And then we got to 
[01:53:30]  Then we got to get into  The Andrew Dice Clay  Phone call from yesterday  It's an amazing piece  Of audio  It really is  It's good stuff  But  This was brought to our  Attention today  What would  Evil Knievel  Be promoting?  He's lending his image  And his endorsement  To a product  So I'm thinking  Maybe Harley Davidson  Sure  Or maybe something  That would go along  With his daredevil image  Maybe a line of clothing  Extreme something  Maybe a line of 
[01:54:00]  Sky cycles  The sky cycle  Oh, yes  Yes  Maybe that's a reality  Now in the year 2000  We could all drive our  Sky cycles  Jump the Snake River Canyon  Sure  You know, speaking of that  Not to get off too far  But there's a commercial out  For I believe  Mercedes-Benz  And it is the coolest commercial  Because it shows  Three people  With jetpacks on  And they're cruising  Through the desert  Like right off the ground  Contour flying on jetpacks  And I just got pissed off  Like where are jetpacks? 
[01:54:30]  It's the year 2000  They were experimenting  With jetpacks  Back in the 50s  21st century  Remember those films?  And here we are  Experimenting  Here at Grumman  With the jetpack  Which will be commonplace  In our society  By the 60s  And what do we get?  Nothing  And then they have the footage  Of the guy doing the jetpack  And it's like  Oh it stores off okay  But it's always  Ended in a disaster  Kind of had a hard time  Waking over  Yeah he goes sideways  I love that footage  Here's the experimental  X-15 
[01:55:00]  The jetpack  Which will take men  To great heights  You will commute to work  With a jetpack  Get out of here  No one's getting a jetpack  We're never getting jetpacks  I want that hovercraft man  From Star Wars  Oh we didn't get that either  No  Remember we were all  Supposed to get hovercraft  How do you wait to work?  With the new hovercraft  Goes anywhere  Does anything  Fly to work  Avoid the traffic jams  This should be available  By 1958  What do we get? 
[01:55:30]  Nothing  It's the year 2000  We still can't figure out  Gridlock in this city  Yeah  Jesus  And then people saying  Flying cars are going to be  A thing of the future  People can't even work  On two dimensions  And a third  And where they can drop  Straight on top of you  Ain't going to happen  They should just  Swallow up your car  If you're in  If you're the guy  In gridlock  Why not?  At this point  You've warned everybody  How about a big  Pneumatic  Square plate  That's  Suspended  Above  Right  It's suspended  High above 
[01:56:00]  The box  Yes  Wildly Coyote  Yes  Okay  And it's on this big  You ever see a pile driver  It's like that  Okay  The second  The light turns red  For a split second  It just comes down  Just smashes everything in sight  And then the other lane can go  But if you're caught in the box  It comes down  You're done  Let's call it back me  I'd be into it 
[01:56:30]  You think anybody would  Pull into the box  And if you did  Tough luck  Somebody said something like  Instead of  To get the accident rate down  Instead of putting airbags  By your steering wheel  Put a spike  Right in the middle  Of the steering wheel  You make sure  You watch where you're going  You don't hit anything  Hell yeah  The airbag's like  Oh I hit something  The airbag comes out  If you knew you were going to be  Impaled on a spike  You'd watch where you were going  This guy Mike's bitching  He says the hovercraft  Was on the A-team  That's right  The A-team 
[01:57:00]  Hey fool  Get in the hovercraft  Get in the hovercraft  I'm going to get in the hovercraft  Where's Earl?  Anyway back to Evil  Evil Knievel  So we're thinking  It's going to be  Some kind of extreme thing  That he's endorsing  Sure  Even though he's up there  In years  He's still known  As the daredevil  Maybe some line of skateboards  Or anything  Yeah  Anything but this  Yeah  Opie  Evil Knievel  What magazine was this in?

[02:09:30]  That they use little rascals  To go through the aisles  They don't even try anymore  They just jump on their little rascal  To feed more food  Into their fat bodies  No reason to walk anymore  I don't even need my big fat legs  That don't work  Now  You know something?  Great  Now you're like Captain Christopher Pike  From the original Star Trek  You're locked in a little vehicle  Just moving around  You gotta take control  You gotta try to do something  And I mean  A ton of our listeners 
[02:10:00]  Have tried the Stacker 2  Very happy with the results  Right Anthony?  Yeah  It does the three things  It burns the fat  That's why they call it  The world's strongest fat burner  It crushes the cravings  To snack in between meals  And it gives you a boost of energy  When you're feeling sluggish  Late in the day  I'm starting to take Stacker 2 again  When I'm feeling sluggish  Yeah  I don't need it for the burning of the fat  Or to crush the cravings to eat  But I'm using it  For the boost of energy  Anthony  Did you see the commercial  On Raw last night?  Yeah I did  That was  That commercial was a little weird  You wanna explain it real fast?  Well a cop is coming over to a car

[02:11:00]  Come to me baby  Yeah but his fingers are touching the cupcake  Yeah  In a way like  It looks like he's diddling it  Let's just say  Yeah yeah  It's a disturbing commercial  But it gets the point across  I guess  For Stacker 2  The world's strongest fat burner  Give them a call  1-800-LITELINE  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E  For Stacker 2  The world's strongest fat burner  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus  I have a strong stomach  You guys make me blow chucks  Oh great  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life

Yeah  He just  He can't block out midgets  So what did he come across a midget and start freaking out?  I guess the story goes my parents left him and his twin brother in a car  Oh no  And my mom went shopping for hours and left my brothers in the car I guess 
[02:23:00]  Yeah they used to do that and it was fine like years ago when you were a kid  I remember that  My mom would you know go into the store and just roll the window down a little  There you go  Yeah I'll be back in an hour  I'll be back  Nowadays you just get thrown in jail for that  Yeah so they're waiting in this car they're really little kids and I guess a midget pulls up  And my brother was all freaked out and then the midget realized my brother was freaked out  So then he just started taunting him  Taunting the midget?  Dancing up and down like  A dancing midget?  Yeah that'll give you some nightmares

[02:29:30]  I'm over here now  I'm over here now  I learned that Spash is better at being a doormat than answering phones  That's Todd from Elizabeth, New Jersey  I learned that idiots use bicycle locks to protect their homes  Joe from New York  I learned today that Spash needs a smack in the face with a big yam bag  That's pretty good  There's no butlers at Best Western  Iron your heavy metal t-shirts 
[02:30:00]  Syndication, that old gag  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  I learned today that Spash is one step away from being Ziggy's neighbor  Yeah  It's looking better, I think  Yeah  We just found out all he has to do is come up with $4,500  And he's got a place that he can move into tomorrow morning at 8 a.m  Yeah  That's good  $4,500  $4,500 he's coming up with  He's got to come up with  And how much is his rent every month?  $900  $900  Do the math 
[02:30:30]  But to move in, it's going to take $4,500 for some reason  For some reason  The normal person, it's first month, last month  Or just one month  Yeah, yeah, it's like first month  But usually you'd be one month security  So up to $1,800  And then a month to the realtor  Yeah, let's push that  So $2,700  He's paying $4,500  That's a difference of $1,800  Go get him in here really fast  You know, you try to keep him off the radio, but  They do 15% 
[02:31:00]  Alright, whatever, let's get it  Spash  He does 15%  Spash, get over there  The realtors  Only 15% of $900  No, they do first, last, and 15 to 20%  Spash  Yeah, but this is in Manhattan  I don't have to do that when I rent my place in Long Island  No, what you do is you write a check for the first month's rent  And then a month's security  And a month goes to the realtor  And that's a lot  Usually they'll accept like a half month  Yeah  If you're in the boonies 
[02:31:30]  I'm not talking about here in Manhattan  Which is a whole different animal  Yeah, he's out on the Connecticut, Jersey  Border  Spash  Why do you have to come up with $4,500 to move into this place tomorrow at 8 a.m.?  The landlord wants two to three months security  Why?  Where are you going in two to three months?  Two to three months?  I guess  How are you going to stay there for two or three months without paying rent?  That's what I want to know  How is this landlord doing this to you?  He's saying that we're a liability to him because of  If you don't pay a month's rent, then he throws you out 
[02:32:00]  And it's one month  How is him holding three months of your money worth...  I don't get it  He said he doesn't want to get burned  He's been burned before  You better get all this in writing  You want him to be enemy of the show?  No  Spash, for you, we will make your landlord enemy of the show whenever you want  Spash, if this guy, yeah, if this guy uses you, he will become enemy of the show  We'll make his life a living hell  How about this?  Huge welcome spash party at his new pad with all our listeners 
[02:32:30]  Oh, rock!

[02:33:00]  Yeah, why not?  You tell the landlord, does he know who you are?  Actually, he does listen to the show, I found out  Well, you let him know, at any moment, he can become enemy of the show  And that is not a happy thing  No, make sure you get it all in writing, Spash  Okay  Fight it, tell him no, look, man  Tell him you can only come up with 3,600 even  A month's security, where are you going?  Say, look, I'm moving in, I'm over here now, where am I going?  That's a ridiculous amount of money  You know what he's going to do? 
[02:33:30]  He's going to take that money and use it to make more money  He's going to, like, invest it or something  And that should be money that Spash has to pay off his credit card  Alright, Spash, thank you  You did a fine job today  You're going to be in that Boy Scout uniform Thursday to get yelled at?
