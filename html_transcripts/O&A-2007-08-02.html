<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about their controversial on-air personas and the perceived pressure to be "nice" on radio.  This segued into morbid speculation about the recent Minneapolis bridge collapse, including the possibility of people faking their deaths.  They then discussed the media's focus on the local impact and the potential for similar collapses elsewhere.  Robert Kelly was in the studio.  The show featured regular segments like "Phone Call Thursday" and "Perv News Thursday" (which they acknowledged had gone poorly the previous week).  "What the Hell Is That?" showcased Bob Kelly's decaying toenail.

Chris Cornell was a guest, and the hosts recounted a news channel mistaking him for Julia Styles.  They also gave a rave review to the movie "Super Bad." Anthony recounted a high-speed drive in a borrowed Ford GT, much to the owner Keith's dismay.  The show included listener calls and a discussion about the incongruity of a baseball game's standing ovation while bridge collapse victims were still unaccounted for.  They briefly touched upon the lameness of mascots, specifically the Milwaukee Brewers' mascot.

The interview with Chris Cornell covered his solo career, vocal training, songwriting, Soundgarden's reunion prospects, and early career anecdotes. He performed an a cappella version of "Time in a Bottle" and discussed his "Billie Jean" cover. The hosts joked about a missed opportunity for a full performance, and discussed the shift from 80s hair metal to grunge.

The extended "What the Hell Is That?" segment featured listeners with unusual medical conditions.  One listener's pus-leaking head bump caused Bob Kelly to vomit on-air.  Doctors Mike and Jessica diagnosed callers' conditions, including Josh's hypospadias, Doug's head lump containing glass, Rajiv's scaly lesion (possibly morphea or psoriasis), Anthony's bifid uvula, and Lewis's severely deformed nostril from a dog bite (retaliation for a past slight).  The segment included graphic descriptions, humorous reactions, and sexually suggestive banter between the hosts and Dr. Jessica.  Prizes were awarded based on audience reaction.  The hosts also discussed internal broadcast issues and listener complaints about segment length.  There was extended joking about getting Bob Kelly a full-body examination from Dr. Jessica.

A subsequent segment focused on the hosts' complaints about cycling gear and a vulgar discussion about body odor and their genitals.  This involved a bizarre offer for a "skin screening" from a guest claiming to be a doctor (whose credentials were unverified).  The segment included graphic descriptions of sweat wicking, inappropriate genital-smelling exchanges, and teasing between the hosts. Jim Norton appeared, discussing his book and experiences.  Internet videos and clips from Maury Povich were shown.

A later segment featured a listener, Bobby, participating in an on-air "doctor's exam" by Jessica.  The exam, described in explicit detail, involved Bobby progressively removing his clothing while the hosts used homophobic slurs, sexual innuendo, and crude language.  Jessica declared Bobby cancer-free but recommended a dermatologist visit.  The "Line of the Day" segment was briefly included.  The show concluded with plugs for upcoming events and appearances.

[00:05:00]  the twins game and uh the bridge was under construction so it was down in one lane i believe  and moving really slow and then this bridge collapsed slowly yeah the metal just kind of twisted  underneath and lowered sections down some fell faster than others but people couldn't get off the  bridge you're stuck in bumper to bumper traffic and uh the bridge is just kind of falling  and you're stuck there you put it in reverse there's a car behind you yeah you can't go  anywhere there was some precariously perched uh on top of each other like some of them you're like 
[00:05:30]  wow that guy got lucky that limo was there just kind of you know stop prop this car up there yeah yeah  but it was it was it was uh falling slowly and then like you said everyone's everyone saw what was  going on ahead and realizing it's kind of buckling or whatever coming their way really really slowly they  had time and so everyone's trying to back up yep and they're all throwing their cars in reverse and  uh some were lucky some weren't obviously uh did you see the school bus uh yes on the uh i saw it on

[00:08:30]  and if you don't want to hear this turn the dial but there were some people that were kind of  a bit relieved if you take just a small percentage if you take that very small percentage if you take  that many people in any situation and break it down there's going to be some bastards in there  there's going to be some people that aren't very nice maybe there was a wife that was being  beaten every night of her life and uh a bridge collapse a building collapse a plane crash whatever

[00:35:00]  and uh they have uh beautiful cars there i mean like race cars so uh yesterday i took out the uh  ford gt now this thing is just it's a monster it's beautiful looks like it looks like a race car  and uh took that out keith dropped it off at my house and uh took it for a little spin um and then  i took it to work this morning uh i have never gotten from nassau county into midtown manhattan as 
[00:35:30]  quickly as i got there i was it was about 110 the whole way just not even having to let off on any  curves or anything it just is on the road your ass is is right on the street the thing is so low  you cannot appreciate it if you're by a computer just put in ford gt and look at the car it is 
[00:36:00]  amazing and you look behind you all you see is a supercharger right by your head because the engine's  in the back and it's right over the rear wheels and this giant supercharger is right by your head  the thing you turn the key you press the start button it just sounds mean and uh you take off  and when that supercharger kicks in it sounds like a jet engine and people will get out of your way 
[00:36:30]  i figured it out when you know when people are in the left lane and they won't move  when they see those like headlights of a race car coming up on them that fast they get out of the  way they get out of the way and those that don't you can now move like like i drive fast in my in my  escalade to work but i know like if i look ahead and go there's a space there but i know by the time  i get there it's gonna be closed down there's none of that with this car you just step on the gas 
[00:37:00]  and you're up to the spot in a second you gotta watch like when you look in your mirror when you're  changing lanes you gotta watch that you're not gonna hit the guy in front of you that's way the  hell in front of you like he's so far in front of you that by the time you look in your mirror and  then look you're right on top of the guy that was in front of you and then boom you zoom over make it  but i made it so fast the the thing that slowed me down i didn't have my easy pass in there so i had to  stop and pay the toll and i understand jimmy's rant about the toll takers because i i said thank 
[00:37:30]  you and got nothing nothing and there i am in a car that might be a conversation piece you know hey  nice car something nothing note to self and i'm actually writing this yes note to self get insurance  on anthony anthony i'm good i'm good and let me tell you something i'll tell you how not good you are  i i heard a rumor that the car is worth about two hundred thousand dollars yeah is this true  yeah more than two hundred thousand dollars yeah it's a little more just a little more than 200 
[00:38:00]  and by the way and doesn't own this car he borrowed it for the day which is key to the story because  keep the cop picked me up this morning and he's in your car yeah and i'm like all right what's this  about obviously something's going on and the whole ride and it's a short ride of the station keith  is in a panic panic why he knows me he's like it's got a two hundred thousand dollar car  and you didn't sign any paperwork nothing i treated it like a two hundred thousand dollar 
[00:38:30]  car with respect the way it should be treated keith fast and with respect my eyes i get tunnel vision  when i drive like that you normally when i drive a car fast i'm scanning the mirrors especially my  rear view for cops yeah i don't even bother because if i pass a cop there's no slowing down  there's no making excuses there's no you're just going to get pulled over if he can catch up to you  you know if i see him i'll pull over but uh you've got to drive this thing with tunnel vision where you 
[00:39:00]  are just so my hands are on the steering wheel so tight and you're looking straight ahead and way  ahead so your eyes are looking at the front of your car but they're also looking way ahead to see  what's going on you got to drive it's a completely different type of driving when you're doing that  and again it's 4 30 in the morning so it's not like the expressway is packed with cars that's all good  a few cars here and there look in your mind and you're under control it's all good it's great keith  didn't think so well and then we get here and you're just a little nervous because it was his 
[00:39:30]  responsibility that's what i'm saying because you didn't sign any paperwork you're getting a little  fender bender well it'll be more than a fender bender there's no fender it's it's either you made it in  pristine condition or they are peeling pieces out of let's just put it this way if you get in a  situation with that car yeah it'll look just like that bridge cloud oh worse you want to  first of all you won't recognize the car secondly just grab some dental records right right to figure  out who the hell i was so you're late today a little late and keith is just uh pacing like an 
[00:40:00]  expected father yeah just wanted the delivery of that car i made it quickly but i had to go to the  garage because the uh the savages at the garage uh i wouldn't let them get in there and park it  and reverse is a little tricky but i got i got it down and i said i want to back this into one of the  spots i don't want one of the garage guys to back it in so it took a while for him to like understand  that uh and of course master poe gloating over the car he's like anthony why didn't you uh 
[00:40:30]  you know why don't you let me drive that over no thank you no i'm gonna third party out a  quarter of a million dollar car to master poe to drive uh no i'm not doing that but it it was  an adventure this morning driving in what did he sign did keith sign for it i don't know i don't care  i guess yeah yeah my my name is on the paper there's some kind of mafia thing going on we 
[00:41:00]  don't ask questions no there's some kind of so it's all your responsibility or something that's  what i was getting at yes yes bob until anthony signs the papers to join it i'm i'm i'm so in now  because uh talking ferraris i want the ferrari next yeah the f1 430 yep smoking and thank god  absolutely thank god jimmy's not here because ann tells these stories and i laugh i think it's cool  and jimmy's just thinking oh god all paranoid if something happens anthony my career my career 
[00:41:30]  screwed and i just laugh along like yeah wake up five minutes later be you know go drive 120 miles  an hour to work oh yeah i'm still picking sleepies out of my eyes you know it's great the midtown tunnel  is uh you ever see battlestar galactica when they launch the fighters yeah that's what that's what it  looks like when you take one of those things through the midtown tunnel yeah at speed what's  funny bob yeah this is funny little jim is panic about a little selfish is worried oh i know he's 
[00:42:00]  just worried about his own well well aware like when he panics about either anthony or i it's it's  it comes from a selfish place like my girlfriend got me a helicopter ride last year for my birth  my birthday yeah and he was in a panic you know how many of those go down and i'm like you don't  care if i live or die you can you you care if i you know you care how it affects you if i die  it's a little different i have a book signing i need to promote right exactly i don't want you  swimming in the ocean exactly talk about his sexual practices that could have cost him his life right 
[00:42:30]  yeah i yeah when i go scuba diving or snorkeling with the reef sharks all that dumb stuff he goes  into a major panic and i know it's it comes from a selfish place it really does i gotta promote a gig  buffalo right i just enjoy uh fast exotic cars i've i've gotten this bug now for these things that  are just i i can't get enough love them exotic exotic i hate what people use it they are exotic 
[00:43:00]  cars it has ferraris lamborghinis see took that giardo out that time it was just amazing you know  it's fun i never got into it oh but it's just like renting you're renting it's like the you're  renting your own vegas who rent the lamborghini what's wrong with that you don't have to worry  about parking it and having some idiot put his door into it and put a ding into it because you  don't take care of it does no they take care of it yeah you know they got they got uh stuff like  that like i get i get a little nervous when i take out my uh my shelby and i park it way far away 
[00:43:30]  and i don't like people getting near it things like that because it's my car if it gets dented  or something i'm gonna be pissed but that's the part of owning a car that is manly that you have to  you know no the part about driving someone else's fine car like that is the fact that you can  goose that thing okay so you so you have no chick you pull up in this what is it called  what's the car you took today today the ford gt okay you pull up in the ford gt and this hot 
[00:44:00]  chicks at a corner she gets in the car you go for lunch and she goes is this your car and then  you say you lie you go yeah but that's the point no it's a rent i'm part of a club no you lie i have  all those guys probably lie and say it's their car of a club why would you do that next week or next  week or next month engagement ring on her finger in the car she's gonna be with you uh forever if  you're the kind of guy that's going out trying to get chicks like that picking them up on corners

[00:47:30]  923krock.com okay right it's opie and anthony uh doctor said cool and that's bizarre which is  something you always want to hear from a doctor it's the return of what the hell is that on the  opie and anthony show hey good morning opie anthony bob kelly in studio getting ready for what the hell  is that some instant feedback coming in we got tyler from uh north carolina espn says that they  played the game because the thousands of people leaving the stadium could hinder rescue efforts 
[00:48:00]  ah in what way i don't know onlookers from another bridge clogging up roads clogging up roads and stuff  yeah windbreaker they play in a dome you idiot that's mike from sussex because we did that whole  thing with the windbreaker on the mdc let me uh tell you something about uh uh mascots i have finally 
[00:48:30]  found the lamest mascot ever ever uh last night it's the the milwaukee brewers mascot dude i'm watching  uh the met game and the when when milwaukee uh gets a home run apparently the brewer is he a beer  brewer is that what he is he's got the big dopey mascot foam head and a big mustache and beard he  looks like an oldie time beer brewer he's brewing some beer he slides down a big slide and the whole 
[00:49:00]  time he's up on the platform making all those dumb mascot moves and then when they hit a home run  there he goes down the slide where the hell did that come from the dumbest thing i've ever seen  i actually out loud said you gotta be me s-ing me yeah there's the big slide and he slides down it 
[00:49:30]  now look i'm not a big fan of the giant apple coming out of the top hat when when they score  at shea stadium uh when the mets do that but the the brewer sliding down the slide has got to be the  most ridiculous degrading thing for the guy in the suit but he comes out of bernie's dugout  is that where he comes out because it's bernie brewer right of course he's bernie brewer there he is  it's bernie brewer he hangs down the dugout and then when a homer's hit he comes out of the bernie's 
[00:50:00]  the bernie dugout and he slides down the slide i was just i was a fan  i was horrified when i saw it i go what is he doing oh no is that what they do when they get home  runs oh so uh that was we were trying to figure out like what the lamest mascot was the other day  and he gets my vote he's up there just because of how he looks and what he's got to do yeah what  they have to do is very important as to how lame they are like this stupid philly fanatic just  getting up on the dugout and putting his stupid tongue out in his stinky uniform yes i said stinky 
[00:50:30]  we had him in the studio one day when we were at ysp and that that goddamn costume stunk like sweat  well bo because it's never been here it's never been washed how do you wash a mascot uniform right  how do you wash it just an awful i bet that mr met head stinks too that big baseball foam head  just smells like dirty head oh man you got the people uh you got them you got them motivated jim 
[00:51:00]  in chicago listening on wckg jim what's up buddy hey guys i'm a cubs fan and the seventh inning stretch  we think take me out to the ball game i don't know what the mets and the yankees do but  the yankees are pretty gay walkie the brewers they got five guys that dress up like different  kinds of sausages there's a chorizo and a bratwurst and a and a uh full of sausage and they and they  run across the field and in foam tubes that look like um now more something else with arms and legs 
[00:51:30]  than a sausage does didn't someone hit one with a bat once they throw all kinds of stuff at them  yeah he got in trouble the yankees have to have the lamest uh seventh inning stretch thing i mean  the sausage thing is pretty stupid but when they do that ymca bit where the grounds crew comes out  and rakes you know the uh the field and um they do ymca i don't like that all choreographed  sausage races is pretty bad that and and when they play cotton-eyed joe i just want to i want to 
[00:52:00]  vomit how's that go how's that go i don't even know oh but it's so bad it's so bad and and i sit  there and then they play a video and it goes from the control room right and it shows some guy with  a goofy wig on in the control room the guy's probably been dead for 10 years the video is like  ancient i think it's from like the late 70s yeah early and he's dancing and they show people dancing 
[00:52:30]  to it in the stands where did you come from where did you come from oh here it is oh i hate this  worst part of the yankee game worse than if they're losing 18 nothing is when this goddamn song  comes on oh it's horrible why are you playing this in new york and then they show people in the  stands dancing if the camera went on me during this i would whip it out and shake it around like 
[00:53:00]  meat spin  this sucks this sucks hey uh a little more info on uh bernie brewer  gaspy what's going on hey how you doing guys love the show thank you listen i can explain the  bernie brewer all right please slide down that slide and he used to go into a giant beer mug  because it's miller park but now because they're so freaking pc they had to take away the beer mug and 
[00:53:30]  now it just looks stupid it looks like he's sliding on a on a on a playground because what is wrong  why why did they have to take away the beer mug for politically correct reasons i have no idea  because i guess baseball and beer they didn't want it to be too but it's miller state like the stadium  is sponsored by miller yes it's miller park yeah it's miller park what's the big deal if a  a mug of beer they're selling beer like crazy it's a cartoonish looking character and beer 
[00:54:00]  the children what of the children oh god the children have to watch their drunk father uh sit  there and and throw uh things at at other fans and then go in the bathroom and use the sink  that's what that's what the children get to watch i don't think seeing a a big foam guy going into a  beer mug is going to cause him problems see they're more uncomfortable actually seeing that 
[00:54:30]  guy slide down a slide right yeah without the hansen should meet him at the bottom what are you doing  here well and what's worse this is what's so ridiculous about political correctness you get  rid of a bernie brewer sliding into a big mug of fake beer by the way yeah but you will will sell  beer until the cows come home and right and there's a bunch of people in your stadium uh during that  exact game that are are just drinking way way too much now all drive much and driving home they'll 
[00:55:00]  ignore that but they'll get rid of the symbolism of a stupid mascot sliding into a mug of beer where  where did you come from where did you go to drive home drink responsibly people please all right  thanks for the info gatsby hey another instant feedback uh henchman from brooklyn he's good for  a few every morning opie super bad is produced by the same team that made knocked up i know that  i i said we saw super bad yesterday it's a really really good movie it's really really funny 
[00:55:30]  you're not gonna learn much but you're gonna laugh your ass off it's one of those movies you're just  gonna laugh your ass off not educational i'm not going let me just like apocalypto let me just say  this and write it down oh damn where's write it down super bad comes out i think next weekend  super bad i have comes out next weekend weekend i have two words for you i have two words for  oh i shouldn't be writing all this ready ready texas to me the whole country will be talking about 
[00:56:00]  the whole country that's not the two words by the way here's the two words okay penis montage  penis montage that's all i'm gonna say see i don't think i'd want to just write down those two words  eric looks like he just uh drank some sour milk just just trust trust me on this i don't want to  leave that just those two words on my iphone uh notes my notes section of iphone now just says  penis montage penis and god forbid someone gets my phone i don't know what they'll think so  eric is disgusted over there penis montage yeah and and people are disgusted on the phone 
[00:56:30]  and they're disgusted on the instant feedback you gotta just trust me on this one penis montage  that'd be a great name for whack bag no doesn't sound cool right not at all it'll be it'll be one  of the coolest things you've seen in movies in in 10 years penis montage monty rock is uh disturbed  over there but you gotta trust me on this one uh the movie comes out in two weeks and uh so yeah  same guys that produced knocked up i refer to knocked up just just because a lot of people saw 
[00:57:00]  knocked up this movie is funnier than knocked up i don't care the same guys made super bad you know  yeah the farley brothers made a bunch of movies some were really good and others were like eh  what are they all supposed to be just as good right knocked up was good knocked up was good but i'm  telling you super bad is much better it was edgy so maybe uh this guy's saying maybe use another  movie to make comparisons with by insulting that you're insulting the same people you're trying  to promote can i uh just use the radio for a private message yeah knocked up and super bad 
[00:57:30]  got it you fat limey oh thank you very good that's all i gotta do very good i also said it was  funnier than the simpsons movie so i don't go to the movies funnier than the simpsons movie he  illegally gets them i don't illegally get anything i said i don't go to the movies unless it's something  i really want to see let me tell you and i go with a fat limey they're getting crazy by the way when 
[00:58:00]  it comes comes to these premieres and stuff yeah and and this was just a basic radio station premiere  no big deal really just me and a bunch of listeners it was nothing right they had so much security  wanting everyone frisking everyone if you if you had a phone you had to put in one of those paper bags  wow they don't want any phones in there they want people recording nothing that's ridiculous because  who's watching a bootleg movie off a phone video yeah but i've seen some bootlegs off of camcorders  and it's bad enough you hear crunching popcorn occasionally you see the guy's hand get in front 
[00:58:30]  of the lens to focus that's because the actual guy is the movie theater guy came in and he's gonna  hide yeah hide hide it uh i've seen some good ones where apparently the guy's friends with the  projectionist and maybe three in the morning lets him in and he could set up real nice and get a  camcorder copy but for the most part they're just awful camcorder copies you need screener copies or  something like that but um what are you gonna get off a phone well the worst thing when people 
[00:59:00]  you know something video is getting stop with the video is getting much better with on the phone  video and sound we're getting they're not close enough minutes at a time yeah yeah 10 minutes at  a clip you're gonna do this and then edit it on uh your mac or something i've seen stop trying to  get concert footage on your phone when someone goes dude i saw this last night  one stage light goes on and the whole screen goes white it's like what what is this crap 
[00:59:30]  keep your phone away dude i'm at the show listen  what is that just hang up so and and then they had like guys that would kick your ass just walk in  the aisles yeah like intimidating everybody as we're trying to watch a comedy and then the paranoia 
[01:00:00]  sinks into you like maybe i'm doing i'm not doing anything wrong why am i paranoid you know what they  also do they have uh people that get behind the screen with uh night vision no way yep it's gotten  to that point it's gotten to that point and they look at the audience and the uh camcorders and stuff  like the smallest little light or anything from the camcorder uh will just shine like the sun  and they could pick people out so you can see the people from behind the screen yeah you can look 
[01:00:30]  right through that screen really and see people it's creepy they just creep me out yeah every time i  won't see a movie that wouldn't be great to i i always thought of this when i realized you can see  right through the screen to put some kind of a bed back there and as the movie's going on just have  sex with your chick in front of a i mean how voyeuristic and like kind of exhibitionist is that they 
[01:01:00]  wouldn't see you but you just look to your side and there's an audience of people looking right at  you because they're looking at the screen and you're just banging away that's hilarious that'd be  cool as hell i'm sure people have done it you'd have to peek out though would you anytime you're  on a stage you can't not peek out i don't think the curtain doesn't open but you'd sneak over to  the side and just stick at it just kind of look while she's doing stuff to you just kind of look  ugly that would be so odd that they're just all staring up at you you're just going at it yeah

[01:08:30]  if he was stung by ten thousand bees because he's got his black his black cap on wow i'm glad i'm glad  i can make you guys think it's chris cornell how you doing man one of the how do you know it's chris  cornell because i've seen you before oh chris cornell one of the greatest singers in rock history right  there i've always said it i've always said that uh we've been one of the best we've been huge fans 
[01:09:00]  that's why we're kind of disappointed we got to at least acknowledge the fact that uh we got a lot  of equipment set up because we thought you were playing today and there was a there was a miscommunication  somewhere we were just talking about that how i don't know how the miscommunication happened but  i'll sing a little bit for you if i could put time in a bottle then there's one thing i'd like to do  i'd put some time in the bottle and then i'd have time in a bottle 
[01:09:30]  wow i came through yeah i don't know how people like like somebody says oh yeah yeah yeah chris will  come in and sing and even i was like it's kind of early yeah for someone to sing i know how it is to  wake up and try to belt something out yeah you know especially with your your range and uh vocal  style it's not really conducive to morning singing not really i mean i've done it but you have to wake  up even you know a couple hours earlier and yeah sort of kind of take a shower and sing or stay up all 
[01:10:00]  night or something well that's sort of what i'm doing now i was i played a show last night and the  night before at the beacon two sold out shows yeah so i've slept i've had about an hour sleep right  right now that's why i don't i don't really know where i am and i'm just singing jim crow  that's why that's happening i like your version better time in a bottle just to get it out of the  way the last time we saw you you were in uh audio slave you were the lead man for audio slave what 
[01:10:30]  happened just um just time to move on yeah i you know i had a solo career happening and that's sort  of why audio slave was able to happen for me and it was a an opportunity that came up and really from  since temple the dog i thought and i want to keep my mind open to cool collaborative ideas and it was  that um but we did three albums pretty quickly and i'm very proud of them love the albums and then just  felt like it was time for me to move on right and um go back to my own world of kind of doing whatever 
[01:11:00]  i want i always thought you were your own person like it's hard for you to just stay in a band maybe i got  issues i was thinking about that like a little stir crazy i'm not sure yeah but you've been  successful no matter what you you've done you know with sound guard and then the temple the dog  which by the way i'm a huge fan of that album huge i can't get enough of it i was i was just uh  uh uh jamming say hello to heaven the other day just singing along to that freaking song and  my vocals are nothing oh don't sing along nothing like yours that's and then what's your favorite 
[01:11:30]  song on it say hello to heaven okay two three go and oh you're on no way man yeah i love when people  you don't understand how that is for a guy that has a range like you when people go hey could you  sing that song like if you're a singer and people go hey sing sing that uh sound garden song or sing  that yeah you're like no you don't understand it doesn't just come out like that yeah that's where 
[01:12:00]  the talent part is sometimes when i put the mic aim the mic toward the audience at the wrong time  and certain songs and stuff doesn't come back yeah it's like hey chris man we just can't do that  i realize what are you doing yeah if it's like everybody say yay they're gonna come up with a yay  but certain parts of songs it might not come back the right way yeah the real high part of sail  in heaven yeah one of those voices that you actually think you can sing like journey you actually think 
[01:12:30]  you can sing that good well you got to go into falsetto so you got no power at all but you but  you just think you're great like a little girl say hello to heaven that's pretty good  and knows how to sing no you can carry it down he doesn't play but anthony knows how to sing he  really does i uh i used to have a few bands back uh back in the old days you know you got to hear  his neil diamond for oh i'll sing neil all day and all night all day don't get me started  it on the neil i heard about uh like i read something where you when you first started 
[01:13:00]  singing you actually tried to figure out where your range was and really couldn't even find it  it's that you just kept trying to go higher and higher it would you wouldn't crack i would sort of  want to scream you know there are parts of the songs that were written where it's just screaming  that's the part you know there's a melody and then there's the screaming part and to scream i would  just sort of sing above my range and then your voice breaks up and it gets all frilled it's white  noisy and we were working on a particular song called heretic that the bass player wrote the the 
[01:13:30]  lyrics for and he all he could do was scream really but then it was decided that i was going to now sing  it so i would scream that part and one day i kind of went really high to get my voice to break up and  there were like a whole bunch of notes up there and that's kind of where it started and then i would  come back a couple days later and there wouldn't be you know and so i kind of you know some days i  could sing the notes some days i couldn't and then it was sort of on the job training we we were a band 
[01:14:00]  for three years before we put out a record we played a lot um and then we toured um you know for years  before really we started selling records that's amazing to me i was remembering now because i like  if i do three shows in a row um i'm kind of you know that's enough a little shot i need a day off  and uh uh our song garden i remember we did 18 shows in a row wow and i'm thinking like how did  i do that 18 in a row if you can do 18 in a row you can do 365 in a row i figure yeah yeah right 
[01:14:30]  i mean after about 10 um you wake up in the morning going like oh can't do it tonight no way i didn't  i didn't remember worrying about it too much i feel like what i do now is much better than  what i did then because i you know pay a lot more attention to it you know and i want to like  uh part of it is like people saying well this guy's a great singer and and uh he was number  whatever on the list of great singers and and over the years i thought well i gotta kind of live up to 
[01:15:00]  that so yeah you know i i kind of try to to make sure i'm in good vocal form and i don't know i i think  i think back then it was a little more crazy and sound garden was so loud yeah that in some  ways it kind of if i sang the best i'd ever sang in my life i'm not sure you would have heard it  what about um jesus what the hell was i just gonna ask you uh well speaking of sound garden  you guys ever i hate when that happens would you get back together i had a great question we do too 
[01:15:30]  yeah yeah go screw yourself bobby where you at with sound garden would you guys ever like do a  little something something i don't think so you're done with them too well it's been 10 years now and  i don't not once have i ever received a call or heard of anybody wanting to get that going again  so the fans man that's who wants to get back together you guys had some great stuff yeah how long  can time go by before it gets silly that you get together again i don't know i think it's so are you 
[01:16:00]  past that cool to not do it not do it yeah it's a way of especially nowadays with everyone getting  back together it's a way of being cutting edge you we can sound garden can be cutting edge by doing  absolutely nothing there's a sort of a genius in that we don't have to get up do you do they're  really ahead of the game man they're ahead of everybody you do uh sound garden tunes a couple of  them uh when you play out yeah i do a lot of different songs yeah um the band i have out now is  like really amazing and and i'm having an incredible time with them we're doing songs from 
[01:16:30]  i think the oldest one we've done is off of louder than love um and they play great and then kind of  everything from then on there's a lot of solo songs i did over the years from movies and then you do  seasons yeah we do that oh god i love that song anything from the single soundtrack yeah from the  the single soundtrack um anything i want from sound garden um we do we know like about  three or four um temple of the dog songs and um we do a couple audio slave songs and then for my 
[01:17:00]  two solo records and um and then i do weird cover songs occasionally you do billy jean i do that yeah  i was just hearing about that i haven't heard yet but i i i hear it's almost unrecognizable you do yeah  yeah it's very different it's like sort of gospel-y it's actually a heavy song lyrically  about a guy who you know gets involved with this woman who says this is your kid and it's not his  kid and it's like all we remember really is a dance track and he's walking backwards but it looks like  he's walking forward and um i i ended up doing that because i i had this period in the set where i do 
[01:17:30]  acoustic songs and i just started getting goofy and like trying to pick silly songs or songs you  wouldn't expect and um to play and just kind of freak the audience out and i thought who would be  really like the last person anyone would ever expect me to cover and i thought michael jackson  but then when i kind of unraveled that song and was reading the lyrics and i changed the time  signature and made it sort of gospely it became really kind of heavy yeah and and i really liked 
[01:18:00]  it and that's how it ended up on the record i just thought you know this is it's a good thing to  like remind an audience occasionally that you know songs and music are really pliable and malleable and  and we don't only have genres don't really exist like we want them to sometimes you know you can  like when johnny cash did rusty cage i kind of learned a big lesson there um did you like it i  loved it yeah i remember rick rubin asking me to do an do an arrangement of rusty cage so that johnny 
[01:18:30]  cash could record it and i thought he was out of his mind and i actually tried like an idiot and and  then called him and said that no i can't do it and then he didn't do it for that record he did it for  another record and and then i heard it and of course it it went doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  like every other song and then the lyrics to rusty cage like oh that's that's how you do that how you're  doing for john now i get it but people actually listen to the lyrics when he's saying them and 
[01:19:00]  then i would get phone messages and from people saying the oh and the lyrics to that song are great  and i would think well why didn't you say that to me five years ago because johnny cash wasn't singing  them is why and we listened to him um it was like that a little bit you uh did you write most of  the songs that are you know known as your songs popular soundgarden and i wrote a lot of the  singles i wrote i think most of the songs we ever made videos for that kind of thing yeah 
[01:19:30]  like the outshine black hole song fell on black days do you like do you when you play those now  do you think like holy crap i can't believe i'm still playing this song not really no and i'm not  sure why i think because there's been breaks in in that period yeah true you're not just out there  pumping it out like that the whole time and there's so many songs like if you think about it  soundgarden especially the last couple records we could never agree on what songs should go on a  record um so we'd go in the studio and record like 16 15 16 songs and we couldn't cut it down to 10 or 
[01:20:00]  12 so we would just put them all on it because that was easier than trying to argue wow so the  last couple records were really like double albums and it's just because of the compact disc we could fit  like 78 minutes of music on it and then when we put them on vinyl they are actually double albums  um so there's a lot of songs and there are songs we i've been doing uh songs here and  there that soundgarden wrote that we never actually even performed i don't think yeah it's probably 
[01:20:30]  different for like the wang chung guys i think they're probably like i can't believe we're still  doing everybody wang chung tonight or aha take on me guy kaja goo goo yeah back together my goodness  yeah that would be a great triple bill oh hell yeah i remember that you know the the movie live  and die in la yeah and wang chung wrote the theme song to that yeah called live and die in la and  the video was great because they don't they're not actually sitting with guitars and kind of writing 
[01:21:00]  the song it's all they're all just sort of writing the music and there's a scene where they're kind  of looking at each other and one guy writes a note on the sheet music and then they high five  that that was just the greatest video 80s rock video moment ever that's a great note give me  some skin it's so easy back then to make videos okay it just needed a little fire yeah and some  high-fiving over notes but as an artist uh do you listen to any of your old songs and wish oh god i 
[01:21:30]  wish i could redo this like there's a part in it where you you just most of it like um  the music and and like the guitar sounds and what's going on sonically in the parts i i think  are like better than i remember them sometimes i listen to the vocal performances and and that  bothers me really not all of it but sometimes yeah sometimes it sounds like it's somebody else or like  i'm i'm you know i've got some attitude going in there that has something to do with more than 
[01:22:00]  just singing the song you know it's like it's not who i am now and do you have an example of that  i would rather do that a song we all know or um there are parts of like the louder than love  record that bother me i don't really know if i could say what song yeah um but like something  must have been going on like in your head at the time like maybe i'm i'm just sort of forcing it a  little bit really you know what i can do i can do it i can sing it but it's like there's something 
[01:22:30]  going on there where it's like like it's acting i guess is the best way to put it yeah i didn't  notice it then but all these years later you know with the experience that i have making records and  just trying to be myself with a microphone in front of me i can hear that little bit of like okay there  here's a kid in there um screaming his ass off but there's like something in there that's not you  know there's something in there that wasn't entirely me that's coming out maybe it's tension  i don't know there is something about uh youth that will just make you do that like balls out and 
[01:23:00]  there was a song we wrote um i wrote actually called cold bitch that ended up being like a  b-side for something um and i had it i got it on my ipod i took it off of tom morello's ipod and i  hadn't heard it in years and it starts out it's very zeppelin it's this big sort of cascading  riff and it sounds so great and i'm just loving it thinking god i wrote this song and then the  vocal comes in and it's so high it's like it's so embarrassing and i think that was probably like 
[01:23:30]  my masterpiece that never really came to fruition because i was such an idiot i thought okay i've got  this great range i'm just going to sing way up there and and it's silly to me that was probably  like 1991 or something you would even think like that like oh god listen to me oh what an ass  it comes in and it's just so bad do you have any like stuff from way before you even started  seriously playing maybe with just like friends in in a garage or a basement that you listen to or or 
[01:24:00]  would go like oh i couldn't even listen to that embarrassing i have that i maybe like when you're  really younger like 80s ish stuff maybe i started out as a drummer and there are probably some tapes of  me playing drums on stuff not much though yeah but it wasn't very good that's for sure no no i do  remember that no singing though with some real hokey dopey lyrics or something like that no no i was  always a genius soundgarden was my first band i mean there's soundgarden's first band oh that was my 
[01:24:30]  first band where i sang it's true that's great otherwise it was drumming in like bad 80s bar bands  that's why soundgarden happened because like uh i ran into two other guys who kind of were having the  same experience like wow if we're going to be in a band that we like we have to kind of  do it ourselves and i that was when i actually picked up guitar and bass and started writing  the lyrics because i thought if we're gonna if we're gonna have good songs we kind of have to do  it we can't wait for somebody else to show up who who was uh in the band when you were the drummer 
[01:25:00]  and like what where where are they do you i have no idea no idea i was in probably 10 bands from 17  do you know what that's like to like be like dude chris cornell was our drummer yeah they're  still talking about you oh they're still saturday night at the bar going dude let me tell you  our drummer was chris cornell and they're like yeah shut up yeah shut up i was the singer man i was  the singer shut up it's your turn to get around you know you're the top eight on my space 
[01:25:30]  shut up we're up we're up it's darts time yeah i used to have a great way of quitting those bands  too which is i i would say and very sincerely i would say you know what i just don't think i'm  i really am good enough to be in your band oh that's sweet that's like you guys are just a little  bit because i was really young too everyone's always older than me i'm holding you guys back yeah  exactly yeah and and they would always look at me you know thinking i don't know this guy's 
[01:26:00]  telling us um that was the only way i could do it but really as a drummer i thought i had this  romantic idea that if i if i practiced and worked at it hard enough some amazing band would just kind  of roll through seattle and go that guy's so great that we want him to be our drummer um and that  didn't happen at least not in seattle i mean it was just never gonna happen yeah um and kim and  hero the the co-founders of soundguard and i met um one was the bass player one was kind of the 
[01:26:30]  fill-in bass player for one of those bad bar bands that i was in and i met them that way and neither  of them liked the band and neither did i but we ended up starting a band together because we decided  well we're gonna have to you know figure out a way to be in a good band and we're gonna have to write  songs and if someone else can do it why can't we do it and then we we spent like a couple years  writing songs and we had those like initial young band kind of awkward songs that had good parts but 
[01:27:00]  were sort of overdone and some of them were kind of silly and there's some probably some embarrassing  stuff in there were you like uh influenced by anything at the time because soundgarden is known to  be one of those bands during the grunge period that was like you know wow this is a standout band  uh how did because it was a complete change of music it went from that 80s hair stuff to the stuff  you guys were doing yeah like what what changed that for you what how did how were you able to take 
[01:27:30]  that 80s stuff and completely get it out of your head and get into this new music it's just so odd to me  that we were kind of in um or wanting to be initially in what was a very healthy us indie  record scene at the time which had bands like um black flag and bad brains and who's could do and  sonic youth and the one wrinkle that we put on it was and maybe it's because seattle was always sort  of a guitar based kind of place we wanted to include 70s rock influences that we liked you know riff 
[01:28:00]  rock old school not necessarily like the 20 minute guitar solos and things like that but um heavy rock  that we liked from the 70s which was not really allowed since punk rock that was sort of not cool  and i think that was a big part of what happened with seattle was just a mixture of influences like  we took aspects of older arena rock that were that were good and mixed it with with more modern kind 
[01:28:30]  of post-punk music and it just took a few years for people to realize oh wait that's okay there  there are elements of 70s rock that are great um and what happened with hair metal was they they sort  of like they would see led zeppelin and they would take like the kimono and the dove and the light show  and they forget about like the fact that it was the best rhythm section in any rock band ever  um they would concentrate on okay robert plan had a really high range so they would just find a singer 
[01:29:00]  that could sing a high range and forget about how great the riffs were or the melodies or the music  that was all sort of left behind um and i think for us we just didn't want to we didn't want to  completely abandon music that we like so we we sort of put it in there and we were not always loved we  we were sort of hated for a while really yeah i remember playing like vancouver canada and and  like ashtrays whizzing past my head jesus christ um because that i always thought of those as good 
[01:29:30]  shows though we felt worse if that's happening um we've maybe we're onto something we know something  they don't know yeah i think that was it because like not being in seattle at the time and that kind  of being the epicenter of what was going on you guys were ahead of the curve uh as to what you know  was going to kind of take off in the country you you kind of saw it building there and uh the rest of  the country and vancouver apparently had to kind of catch on yeah i was thought of it as like you know 
[01:30:00]  you got this white snake video with the guy who's who's model wife or whatever is doing the splits on  a variety of jaguars right and it's it's kind of what hip-hop does sometimes which is separating  the the artist from the audience and like basically throwing it in your face like you ain't gonna be  me and you're never gonna have her and then you then you see like smells like teen spirit which is 
[01:30:30]  probably a catchier song in the pop world um and and a with with a youthful aggression but with three  guys one guy's like six nine one guy's like five five um and they just look like the same people that  you go to high school with i think that was the the key factor in like this tremendous cultural shift  was like okay we don't you know seeing a video of motley crew coming down in the helicopter is kind of  cool but this is cooler and this is what we've been missing unattainable yeah yeah that was you know 
[01:31:00]  that was rock and roll yeah that uh it just seemed to happen so quickly too like really yeah and the  fans do that record companies don't do that there is no kind of marketing that can make that happen like  that that quickly that was literally like a whole bunch of young rock fans that said oh this is what  we've been wanting being in that atmosphere in seattle did you were you as taken by smells like  teen spirit as the rest of the country was where how that was kind of like wow what the hell's going 
[01:31:30]  on here i remember ben shepherd coming into a sound garden rehearsal before they had even made that  record and um he said yeah i saw nirvana last night and he got the name wrong he said um they had this song  uh smells like teenage spirit it's amazing i think it's going to be a huge hit which is weird hearing  him even say that yeah and that was probably like eight months before it was recorded um but it was  like that you know you they would play in front of 100 people and um that was around the time when 
[01:32:00]  that talk started happening like um you know it's not just an indie scene this is something that can be  like new rock and roll for the masses kind of thing and then you got the pissed off fans that  were there from the beginning going to sell out man oh what are you doing man sorry people like us  yeah you liked us but the other people aren't allowed to yeah is that how it works they because  everybody kind of wants to think they're a little cooler than everybody else so if other people start

The pal talk people  You just want to smack them sometimes  You realize that, you know  They are just internet people  Really?  Why?  What happened?  Just enough  Shut up  Turn this off  This is crap  More boring than the interview  What to do?  You know what?  I read nothing but positive things about the interview 
[01:39:30]  We got three or four  Look, we got three or four guys still on hold  They just want to say this  Dave and Mastic, go ahead  Hey, I just want to thank you guys for an awesome interview, man  It proves to anybody that has anything different to say  That you guys aren't just a couple of idiots on the radio  Well, thank you, Dave  Take care, thanks  We get a little in-depth  If we try to do anything that's a little different  These haters just jump all over us  You know, I actually wanted to know  What the whole feel was back then 
[01:40:00]  When it went from hairband to grunge  From the guys up there  Right  Like, did they see it coming  And what were the influences?  Right  Because there wasn't any influence  You could just kind of pull out of your butt  And start working off of  And that was interesting to find out  That it came from, you know  That 70s arena rock thing like that  But people, I don't know  What would you rather us do?  Punch him in the face?  Bring him a cake and step on it? 
[01:40:30]  Look, we  You know  There's times and places for that stuff  Yeah  Show him a pussy wound  We always want to, you know, be unpredictable  You know, just throwing Billie Jean on by Chris Cornell  That's, that's, that's  I like when we do that  I like it a lot  Speaking of that whole thing with Seattle Ant  I wanted to get into Mother Love Bone with the guy  Because Mother Love Bone  He, he roomed  Chris Cornell roomed with Andrew Wood  Who was the lead singer of Mother Love Bone  And you want to, like, listen to a band  That's right in between hair band and grunge 
[01:41:00]  That was the band  Yep  And I want to know what the influence  Mother Love Bone had on that whole scene  Because they still were doing  Some kind of hair bandy things  But they also had their 70s arena rock influence in there  And then Andrew Wood, you know  Dies, he ODs  And that's why Chris Cornell put together Temple of the Dog  See, we wanted  As a tribute to Andrew Wood  We didn't talk to Chris for another 15, 20 minutes at least  Easily  I was, I was bummed that we had to take a break  We were so late at that point

[01:58:30]  Get him  Bobby has a very weak stomach for the new listeners  Yeah, Bobby really doesn't like this at all  He gets the heebie  Nobody  Nobody  Nobody, you're right, Bobby  Oh, shit  You might want to  We're still on regular radio, Bobby  Bobby  Oh, sorry  That's okay  Bobby's got tears in his eyes  All right, Bobby  Check it out  Tears in his eyes, I guess  He looks at this lump  Just let me move into this  Look at this  It's like jumping in a pool  All right, look at this  Give me a second  Give me a second  Look at this  All right, give me a second  All right, here he goes  Bobby's looking  He took one look 
[01:59:00]  Ran off with his bucket  And is puking in the corner  Oh, he's got a weak stomach, man  There's a freaking hole in his head  Will you get over here  It's not a zit  It's a hole in that kid's head  Somebody needs to help him  All right, hold on  We've got to describe it 
[01:59:30]  I mean, it's not just a bump  Well, I mean, describe what it looks like  Doctor  He has what's called most likely an epidermoid cyst  It's an overgrowth of tissue underneath his skin  And then the hole in the top of his head is called a punctum  Because of this overgrowth  The bacteria that's normally on your skin  Fills it up  And then pops out of that hole  How can you fix that?  Oh  You just cut it out  Closes right up  That was like my older brother on weird science  Can you fix him?  I'll pay for it  Please 
[02:00:00]  It's easily fixed by someone  Is that easily fixed?  I'm so bad about this  Now, is that an in-office procedure  That he wouldn't have to go into a hospital or anything?  This bump for the people out there  Looks like it's dead  It's like a volcano  It's grayish  It's whitish  It's flaky  I think the dandruff on top of it  That he has not been able to wash  Is flaking  Yeah  Putting a little snow on top of it  Yeah, do you have to mess with his self-esteem more than that?  You're going to say he's flaky?  Well, actually, that is the kind of thing that I do  Get over here with you  How would that start?  Like, how does somebody get that? 
[02:00:30]  I thought I saw my head  Just a localized overgrowth of tissue  A localized overgrowth of tissue  What is that?  Just DNA gone mad  And deciding he's going to pile up some tissue over here  Let me ask you a question  It could start from bumping your head  Is your recommendation just growing your hair longer and hiding it?  Or should he maybe go to a doctor and have his head sewn up?  Let me remind everyone here  Although we are doctors, we are not your doctors  Right  We should all be going to a physician  They have these things checked out  But can you do this for the troops? 
[02:01:00]  Bobby  Just do it for the troops  Fix his head  We're running out of show  Come over here  We're going to pop this thing  There's a dude with no nose  We're going to  He's pooping out blood  When you say to me  He's pooping out blood  We're going to pop this thing  Can you pop this thing?

Um, well, let's see  We're not on the XM side here  No  So, let's put it this way  Um, my organ has binocular vision  Oh, oh, you have two  Where you should have one  Um, where you would excrete 
[02:04:30]  Uh, liquid waste  Exactly  To the left of the main eye  Shall we say  Yes  Uh, there's just a little smaller one  Wow, that is odd  Doctor, have you heard of this?  Yeah, I know  Exactly what it is  Show it to everyone  Alright  Alright  This is gonna be the one time in my life  Where I wish I was black  I swear  Well, don't worry about it  One time in my life  In your wife  Yeah  In my wife  You still have a little Freudian slip

[02:05:30]  It's gonna make her appear  Wow  Alright  That's  Quite the position she's taken up  She's kneeling, uh  In front of him  Getting a good look  Well  You can imagine what's going on by the laughter  Thank you  Huh, what's going on?  I'm sorry  It looks beautiful to me  It's  Oh  A condition called hypospadias  Yeah, it's hypospadism  Oh  Excellent  And how is that caused?  It's a congenital  Secondary growth of your urethra  Okay  So it kind of 
[02:06:00]  Exactly what he said  Split off  And, uh, there's no repercussions from this  It doesn't have to be corrected  Can I ask you  Bad aim  Bad aim  Okay  Can I ask you a question though?  The ultimate split early in the morning  Sometimes I'll destroy a toilet  Can I ask you a question?  Does Pepsi come out one and Coke the other?  No  I think it's rum and Coke  Does it separate like that though?  Like you can be like  Hey, check this out  And look over here  I don't know  Can you control which one comes out what?  If I could 
[02:06:30]  I'd be in movies right now  Yeah  Yeah  That's true  So, uh, obviously your whole life has been like that  But, uh, uh, is one, um, larger than the other?  Yes  The, uh, the main one is much larger  Much larger  Than the second one  Okay  And this doesn't affect you, um, sexually?  No, it doesn't  Actually, uh, women have never said anything  But the women I've been with really haven't been in a position to say anything  Oh, okay  They've never said it to your face  I got you  Believe it, it's fucking behind your back  Can hit a broad in both eyes?  Right  Okay 
[02:07:00]  Uh, people  Some people are suggesting the treatment is spackle, doctor  Surgery, unfortunately  What about a wine cork?  Yeah  A very tiny wine cork  Alright  But there is a surgical procedure that could if you wanted to, uh, solve that  Slightly increased risk of infection  It's called duct tape  Oh, there is, okay  Never had an infection  I'm not letting a knife go down there  Eh, don't you worry about it  I'm Jewish  I've already had a knife down there once  That was enough for me  Alright  Alright, listen, listen  Running out of show over here, Joe 
[02:07:30]  We gotta move on  We gotta move on  Alright, very good  Well, who do we got next there?  Who's up?  Doug, we have next  Alright, Doug  What's up, Doug?  How you doing?  I'm Doug  Uh, I don't have a problem like that  I mean, I sort of know what my problem is  I'm another head guy  I got a lump on my head here  Wow  And, uh, you know, to me, it's normal  I've been living with it  I know how I got it  I got in a head-on collision  Oh  I wasn't wearing my seatbelt  So, I was good for a year 
[02:08:00]  I thought I was good  They sewed it up  And then little pieces of, uh, glass started coming out  So, I was, uh, you know  I'd be scratching my head  And a little tiny piece of glass would come out  And then, I went to the barber  And I get my head shaved  And there was a piece sticking out  Old Italian man, he's retired now  And I said, you know, I told him  I might have a problem shaving my head  He's like, oh, don't worry about it  He shaves my head  He puts hot rags on there  And he, when he's done  He starts pushing out 
[02:08:30]  And the piece of glass he pushed out  Is, uh, made me a little nervous  It looks as  It's, you know, a pretty decent sized piece of glass  That was in your scalp  That I was holding around  It's the size of an aspirin, right?  A little bigger  A nice, a nice Tylenol gel cap  He had the last Mimsy come out of his head  But, uh, you know, I had that in my head for 10 years  And I was wondering maybe  I think I still may have a piece in there  And I was wondering maybe  If it would change into something better than windshield  Yeah  No, and my barber, by the way, told me, you know 
[02:09:00]  He said, F doctors  You don't need doctors  You come for me  Oh, you got the barber  But he's retired now  Well, let's explain  You know, you got a shaved head  And the bump is, uh, how big, guys?  What'd you say?  On the head  Hmm  Yeah, it's about, uh  It's about marble-sized  Marble-sized  It's got a little extension off of it  Yeah, very oddly-shaped  It was bigger before this piece here  Hey, what'd you get that shirt out of the hamper?  Hey, Rhett  Right, right  Your assistant to the assistant manager at the movie theater 
[02:09:30]  Kind of sound like the moan, my friend  All right  So what do we think, Dr. Mike?  Retained foreign body  He's still coming out  He needs to see someone  To make sure there's nothing else in there  Retained foreign body  Yes  So your head went into the windshield  Some of the glass got in there  And it's probably still in there  100%  He has to make sure there aren't pieces of glass  Slowly working their way into his brain  Wow  Wow  Now, what do you think that would do?  The hell do you think?  I don't know if it would make a big difference  I mean, I'm only a plumber  I just gotta go put pipes 
[02:10:00]  You're just a plumber  I really need my brain?  You don't need it  I like your attitude  All right  You just need pants that don't fit  Have someone see that  Because you can get infections later in life  You think it could go through the skull  That piece of glass?  No  But the infection could be bad  All right, listen  You lose half your skin  Anthony  Yeah, that would be  This is what we're gonna do  We're going late here in New York today  I hope some of the other affiliates are smart enough  To just go late if they want to  Certainly do  Philly, I hope you're on it  Because we're gonna go to about 9.15 today 
[02:10:30]  Okay  Because we gotta take a break  And then we got what?  Three or four more guys left?  Three more  All right  Three more guys to check out  We're in the middle of what the hell is that  Here on the O.P. and Anthony show  So to the affiliates  We're going to 9.15  If you want to stay with us  We'll promise we're not gonna curse and all that  All right  I'm hoping at least Philly  And at least Boston  And Chicago  Well, we hope everybody stays with us  Just stay with us  I started playing favorites  I'm an idiot  It's O.P. and Anthony  Stay there  Doctors, do you see a lot of this? 
[02:11:00]  Is this a common thing?

Way to go with it  We're in the middle of this great, disgusting  Little thing we do  This has to be the best idea ever  But the worst  Mike at WBCN, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  We didn't bail

Chris McDevitt  He's on here  Newbrunswick.com  Monday nights  With my friend  Pat Breslin  Okay  Chris McDevitt tanked  He was the dude who said  That his dump looked like a lowercase  Curse of G  It was kind of funny, actually 
[02:13:00]  He was just really nervous  I remember him  What's wrong with your throat?

[02:13:30]  All right, you will move up  But it takes me  All right, I'm going over there  I can't just jump in the pool  I'm going in  I'm going in  This, I think, is Dr. Jess's territory  Well, let's see  She does skin  So he's got some weird  Oh, wow  That is big  That's not that bad  It's big  Forward a little bit  It's about  About three inches long  As you study that  I'm good at explaining things  For the radio  That's a  Just picture a big wad of gum  And then just  Stretch it across your 
[02:14:00]  Mid-back  Yeah  And then there's some kind of  It's this color  Lesion on it  This looks like a plaque  Of psoriasis  But I think  It actually might be  Something called  Morphea  Which is when  The skin  Morpheus  Turns into a scar  For no reason  Wow  There's also  What happened to you  When did that happen  When did you first notice that  Probably about two years ago  Uh oh  Has it been growing  It like showed up overnight  And then it was just kind of there 
[02:14:30]  And then like a year later  It like doubled in size  Can I ask you a question  Do you ever really  Piss off your dad  It looks like  Yeah  It would look like  Something  Looks like an old burn scar  More like if you  Yeah  A nice whip to the back  A whack  It's about an inch wide  And about what  Five inches long  Actually there's a small  Reddish spot in it  Yeah what is that  Which makes me a little nervous  Because  Well on the other day  I did peel off  A decent sized chunk of it  Okay good  I got it right here 
[02:15:00]  That makes me feel better  Oh my god  You got the chunk  You peeled off  It looks like a  It looks like a  Contact lens  It's kind of scaly  Well  Old scars  Can occasionally develop  A little skin cancer  Can I ask you a question  No he is Indian  You sure he didn't get  Bit by a cobra  I don't know  A Gila monster maybe  Well Bob's not puking  So it can't be that bad  No it's not that bad  Well it's kind of disturbing  Thank you  Obviously  Obviously now 
[02:15:30]  He should go see  A doctor about that  He should go  See a doctor  For sure  Yeah  I did see a dermatologist  Like six months about it  Oh  And he just said  It's that morphia thing  Don't worry about it  Just hope it doesn't  Pop up anymore  Don't worry about it  Okay that's good  Yeah he was real helpful  Do you have insurance  Uh huh  Isn't there a way to like  Maybe get rid of it  Yeah can he take something  Then gouge it out  He's got duct tape  We don't actually know for sure  What causes it  Right  Wow  So sometimes  It may just have to stay there 
[02:16:00]  Is it just in Indian people  I guess they could try to cut it out  No but it can be more common  With Indian people  In different skin types  Really  Oh interesting  So can we cut it out right now  And then duct tape it together  Would that help  Well I was going to bring my scalpels  But I decided  Yeah  I may not be let in  If I did that  No surgery Bobby  Well apparently  All the sexual things  She said to me  She was joking too  Cause that was  Bobby  Awful joke  Well we'll  We'll never know  Cause you're not getting naked  Bobby  Get naked  For the lady  What do you want  He had to drop you too

[02:24:00]  I just had it covered  I didn't even realize  It was missing  Wow  When I finally took my hands off  They asked my wife  Do you have his nose  Oh jeez  By the time she went home  To get it  How big of a piece  Was chewed off  You know I never saw it  But I think it was  Like an inch  It's that side of his nostril  But after he put it off  Did he sit and give paw  You know when she went home  To get it  He was still laying  In the same spot  Really  Yeah it would have been  Because he would have been dead  We had him put to sleep  Oh you're dead  You had him killed  What were you doing  I went to kiss him goodnight  You went to kiss him goodnight 
[02:24:30]  Was it your dog  Yeah  His name was Phil Bird  How long did you have him  Well we adopted him  He was an abused dog  Oh great  So how long did you have him  We had him 10 months  10 months  Yeah  And did he show that  He was a little girl  A little snappy  A little nippy  Kissing him goodnight  Brought back some horrific  Memories for the dog  Apparently  I just got some in the ribs  Let's say the obvious  So they're building  They built you  A side of the nose  What is that called doctor  This part of the nose  Well that's the ALA 
[02:25:00]  Besides disgusting  The ALA  The one nostril side  Is an ALA  And the edge of it  Is the ALAR rim  Ah  This is very complicated  Surgery actually  For the inside of it  Wow  They took some of the leg  And put it on the inside  And then they're  Going to build it up  And you'll look like  You have a regular nose  Now docs  We're having a little  Trouble with the tip  Because every time I smile  Or maybe when I'm sleeping  It keeps breaking the stitches  So  Yeah  Well stop smiling  Don't smile  I won't have a nose  If you stop smiling  Yeah look in the mirror  You have nothing to smile about 
[02:25:30]  Oh wow  Bobby  In a couple months  You're going to be fine  You're going to be like  It looks great  But right now  You should be frowning  A question to the doctor  We got to kind of wrap up here  But will the nose  Look relatively normal  When this procedure is done  Yeah I mean fairly  I mean you're going to be able  To tell he had surgery  This isn't going to be  A brand new nose  But better than missing  Half of your face  Sure  You know I was  Right with my cheek  Can they just leave  Instead of putting it back  Just leave it  And give me like a facelift  On this side  Oh you kind of like  The way it looks  Kind of squeezed  Yeah 
[02:26:00]  And now  Actually this could turn out  To look quite good  Yeah  Depending on the surgeon  Alright good  Wow  Could you do the other side  Just like that side  Like just make it a big nose  Like he played basketball  For the Celtics  Back in 1982  Oh wow  One of the big three  I won't say which one  Listen  Just  Can I say the chief  You get any more  You get another dog  Actually we just got  Another baby bulldog  Last week  Are you crazy  Are you nuts  Why would you do that  Kiss him goodnight  On the other side  Any pending litigation

[02:30:30]  Back  So I don't know  I don't know what we should do  No one's happy  Let me tell you something  We  We went  Long  On FM  To finish up  The what the hell was that  Little contest  Which was a complete success  Oh my god  I was hoping  It would be half as good  As it was  A little radio secret  We didn't have much confidence  In this  What the hell is that  In the first one  Because whenever we bring  Something back  The first version  Is usually just kind of 
[02:31:00]  Getting the bugs out again  Yeah  Kind of getting up to speed  I didn't have confidence  In this one  Ant didn't have confidence  In this one  The people that were  Calling and emailing  Were like  Oh boy  We need a couple good ones  You know  Yeah  And we still weren't  Feeling it  Even as we did  The radio show today  So we kind of  Yeah  You push it to the end  Yeah  You push it to the end  Got to admit  And we push it to the end  It was radio gold  I mean  Puss head  Who's going to forget him  Anytime  Puss head  Made it  Right from the start  I'm like  I was so disgusted 
[02:31:30]  With Puss head  Yeah  And  Wait till you see the video  And the pictures of Puss head  And Bobby  Puking  I don't know if Sam  Could get all the action in  Because Bobby's running  Running over there  Stuff squirting out of  Puss head's head over there  When they finally decided  To pop the thing  On Puss head's head  And of course  Since he's Puss head  It was Puss that came out  It was so  Completely disgusting  I had to turn away  Yeah it was really gross  And Bobby just ran away  Puking  It was fantastic  A great success

Yeah, I'm making it  Bam  I wonder what's going to be  The future effect  Of all the media  We have access to now  As far as videos  Because only a couple  Only a couple of years ago  We're talking two years really  Where you really kind of  Had to search for things  A couple of years ago 
[03:07:00]  Now  You just pop something  In YouTube  Or Break  Or any of the numerous  Video sites  You're seeing anything  You know what?  Anything you want right there  And I'm not even talking about  It's going to desensitize  People to that  I mean, what's really  Going to be the impact  Of  Are people going to  Actually get maybe  Even smarter  By seeing so much  So much information  You're just going to  Be able to watch the world  Yeah, but that  Has an effect  The fact that  24 hour news  That has an effect  On the world  It had an effect 
[03:07:30]  On the world  Let's say the Vietnam war  The first war  Brought into your living room  With television  That had an effect  Just the guy  Being able to send  A message  To another empire  Somewhere  Had an effect  On how the world  Is viewed  Communism pretty much  Fell because  The people in the east  Actually saw  Because of satellites  How the people  In the west lived  And realized  That their governments  Were kind of bullshitting them  That had a huge effect  What is this going to do  To society  Because it's just  The beginning  It's such the beginning 
[03:08:00]  But it will have an impact  But I don't know  What it's going to be  It's going to do both  I mean, people  People are definitely  Going to get smarter  Because they're going to  Actually see what's going on  Yeah  Like in, you know  The 1800s  If you were going  To the west coast  You'd be like  Alright, I'll see you  In two years, honey  I'm taking the kid with me  Yeah  You know what I mean  He might be here  He might live  I don't know  Yeah, you will get more educated  I mean, right now  Of course  It's fun to watch people  Faceplant  And chicks to fight  But this is kind of  Going to mutate  Into something else  And it's going to 
[03:08:30]  Affect the entire globe  It's going to affect  Human beings  And we're going to  Take another one of those  Like notch steps up  Into something  You know how humanity  Kind of cruises for a while  And then something comes along  And we take a step up  Like the iPhone  Transportation  Yeah, the iPhone  Computers  Things like that  And computers in general  But then there's  Things that computers bring you  Which is this  Whole fucking  Bevy of information  And visual  Things from  Everywhere  You know what I hate about it 
[03:09:00]  Is the fact that  You know that  The world just sucks  There was a time  Before computers  And CNN  And Fox News  You were living your life  On this part of the planet  Look  Look out the window  It's a nice sunny day  Peaceful little New York City  You got blue skies  And a sunny summer day  Right?  You'd have to search out shit  Back in the old days  Now you turn on the TV  And you can just see  Some horrific thing  Happen on the other side  Of the world  Look at this  It was out of sight  Out of mind before  This is a guy  Just getting his fucking ass 
[03:09:30]  Beat by a gang of people  Yeah  And trying to run away  Now this  You didn't see this  No  You would just go  About your life  Like oh let me go  Go buy some groceries  Is it making people  More cynical  Jaded  More hated  Hatred of other people  I don't know  It's gonna have an effect  But I don't know  What it is yet  It makes you feel like  The world is fucked  I wanna figure it out  There was a day  You didn't think that  Like there was a day  Like they were fighting  Just horrific battles  On the other side of the world 
[03:10:00]  You lived your whole life  And had no clue  There was ever this horrific battle  Yeah  While you were living  While you were living  While you were living  While you were living  And just  Just chopping wood somewhere  They were just  Lopping heads off  And the whole society  Right  Dying  And you had no idea  No idea  No clue  It affects radio people too  Because I mean you guys  You know  Pretty you know  Not to be gay  But you know  You're good looking dudes  Right  But back  I mean most radio guys  Just back in the  You didn't know  What they looked like  You heard them  They sounded unbelievable  You imagined that  They would look like 
[03:10:30]  You know  Hair part  Like Barbie dolls  And then you show up  They weren't as cute  As you wanted  They're just fat messes  You know what I mean  They're just bald  They're sweat  Like what's that  What's that guy  With the 101  That sex court  He used to be a big radio guy  Oh Tom Lickass  Yeah he used to think  He'd be like this  Strong dude  Like a superhero  And then you see him  He's got glasses  He's bald  He's a mess  With his down syndrome haircut  Jesus  He's a douche  He'll always be a douche  I don't know how we got  Started on that  But 
[03:11:00]  We gotta take a break  Just something I've wondered  But you know what  What's interesting  You know the big bridge collapse  Right  Yeah  Now this is  We all think differently now  Than we did two  Three years ago  As soon as I saw that on TV  I'm like  Alright gotta go to the computer  And check out the video of it  Yeah  I just knew that they had video of it  Yep  Absolutely  And even the news  They're in a panic  Because now they just openly go  If you got video of this  Please send immediately to  They got a whole link  On their news website  Yeah  They know  They know they're losing

[03:32:00]  Every morning  On the O.B. and Anthony  Radio show  His new book  Happy Endings  The Tales of a Meaty Breasted Zilch  Debuted at number four  On the New York Times  Bestseller list  And you can see his work  Whenever you like  On the Super Deluxe  Website  Please say hello  To Jim Norton  Thank you  Thanks for having me  Oh thank you mister  My girlfriend  I'm really irritated  My girlfriend's in New York  At my apartment 
[03:32:30]  And she knows I'm here  She knows what I'm doing  And as I'm coming here  I get a text from her  And it says  Hey you're at a toilet paper  So I'm thinking  Alright  Did she just happen to notice  Or do we have a situation  So I ignore it  Because I don't want to know  The answer to that  Because that's the last thing  You want to picture  Is your girlfriend  Beating up sweat  On her forehead  Sitting on the bowl  Like Danny Glover  In Lethal Weapon 2  So I ignore it 
[03:33:00]  A minute later  I get another text  What am I supposed to do  I don't know  A headstand in the shower  I'm doing a TV show  You idiot  Grab a sock  Learn the improv already  You're 15 years old  And we fight constantly  And worse than fighting  Is the post-argument 
[03:33:30]  Discussion of the issues  You know how you have  That like argument  And then they talk after  Where you're supposed to  Discuss everything  Without the anger  But it always turns into  This awful passive-aggressive thing  No no no  I'm just saying  Don't you remember  When you said  And she says things like  You know  I don't mind when we argue  I just hate when you yell  Well then you mind  When we argue stupid  That's what makes it  An argument  If you're having an argument  And both people  Are talking like this 
[03:34:00]  That's not an argument  That's a woman  Lecturing  An emasculated idiot  And I hate to tell women  But if you're with a guy  And he never gets louder  Than this when he's angry  When he's not with you  He's strangling prostitutes  I can't tell if you're applauding  For the joke  Or the idea of strangling hookers 
[03:34:30]  And I spot guys  From like that  A mile away  Like one of those guys  That blinks slowly  You ever talk to a slow blinker  There's nothing creepier  Than someone who doesn't know  How to blink properly  It's like  Hey how you doing  Oh I'm alright  No you're not  And she  She's good to date  Like I like having a girlfriend  But I was single for five years  And there's so much to get used to  In a relationship  Like things I forgot about  Like after sex 
[03:35:00]  As we're laying there  I have to keep repeating to myself  Do not hand her cash  Do not hand her cash  Which is a nice improvement  Over last year  When it was  Ignore the Adam's apple  Ignore the Adam's apple  We've all made that mistake  Haven't we  You know you're receiving  Some fantastic oral treats  All of a sudden you're like  That's a large bag for a gal  Well now you're at a crossroads 
[03:35:30]  Because this is technically  A homosexual act  Yet on the other hand  This fella sure knows his business  Although I'm not gay  I'm not  I think I would be  If I was in better shape  But that's why I'm not homophobic  Because gay guys never hit on me  Because I live in New York  Where all the gay guys do  Is work out six days a week  Every guy in the gym I go to  Is gay  None of them hit on me 
[03:36:00]  None of them even acknowledge  I'm alive  I'm like a ghost in the gay gym  It's like I've actually had guys  Get on equipment  I was still using  Thank you guys very much  You are a slice of heaven  A slice of heaven  Thank you Jim  Jim Moore and everybody  We'll be right back  There you go  Not bad huh  Jimmy's funny  He's hilarious  And then he got some couch time  You want to hear that  Yeah yeah  That's the best part  I like the couch time  We're going to do line of the day too  We haven't taken a break

[03:53:00]  I'm loosening it up  A little bit in front  But I'm actually going to  Start my exam  With the scalp  Top of the head  So head your head forward  A little bit  And with his head shaved  Because I'm tall enough  That I can just look right  At the top of his head  Oh boy  That's not good  That's good  And I so far  Don't see any signs  Of skin cancer  On the scalp  The ears  Look clear  Neck  Also looks clear  Lift your head up  A little bit  Front of the neck 
[03:53:30]  There's a little  Bump on the front  Of the neck  But I think it's  An old zit  Not skin cancer  Wait a second  See this is what  I was hoping for Bobby  Hang on  Now go explain  Your dumb zit to her  An old zit  What is that anyways  I think it's a zit  Can you touch it  You picked that  Yeah but it won't go away  Well you might need  A little surgery  Oh boy  Yeah  I need surgery  Now I have to examine  Your face  She's tall as hell  Wait Bobby  You keep picking at a zit  And now it's a problem  Don't pick it

[03:58:00]  Oh one  But I think it's just like a thing  Where is it  Right here  Hang on one second  Let me find it  Hang on  I lose it sometimes  Because it's  You know my  When your balls get tight  It's like over here  I forget where it is  Where is it  He's really taking a lot of time  Feeling around here  Hang on one second  You don't smell that  No  All right go ahead  Okay now  All right now  I'm against the wall  Like  Patrice's childhood

[03:59:30]  That means like  There's no sexual  Like  Well I'm being very professional  Yeah  So like  It means it's in the right spot  Your asshole isn't on your side  Or something  Right  So  I'm sucking in my gut  For some reason  Like I need to do that  Should I shave  Like  Should you trim that  I would let your girlfriend  Answer that  No but do you trim that  Should you trim that  Is that healthy to do  I think that's a matter of taste  What do you like  Tasting it 
[04:00:00]  What do you mean  Does hairy assholes  Taste less better than  I think if you  You just get  Less stuck in your teeth  I think if  If you shave your ass  Hair  Right  It starts growing back  It'll probably feel like  You've got a pin cushion  Up your ass  So if I  But if you shave your ass  Does it grow back  Like threefold  While I look an orangutan  Or something like that  Yeah that's it  No more hairs grow  Than normal  But the tips of the hairs  Can feel a little rough  Right  You could get waxed  Do you shave
