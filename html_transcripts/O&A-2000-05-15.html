<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Jay Moore's appearance on Bill Maher's "Politically Incorrect." Opie and Anthony harshly criticized Maher, focusing on his stand-up and perceived arrogance, while praising Moore's jokes, particularly those about condoms and premature babies.  Moore's own prematurity was contrasted with Maher's views on the viability of premature infants.  Their own negative experience interviewing Maher was also recounted.  Listener calls followed, including one about a seemingly intoxicated Tom Brokaw at a Knicks game and numerous calls regarding issues with the show's "Wow" sticker promotion, centering on the incompetence of a staff member named Earl.  The hosts then engaged in sexually explicit and offensive commentary about Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and Christina Aguilera, their perceived sexual availability, and their public images. A listener call detailed a date with Bill Maher, devoid of sexual activity. The segment concluded with further complaints about the "Wow" sticker distribution and Earl's failures.

The show then transitioned to the chaotic preparations for the "Wow" sticker giveaway at the Staten Island Ferry.  The hosts repeatedly berated Earl for his extreme lateness, punctuated by angry phone calls and his eventual hang-ups.  Psycho Mark's lateness also contributed to the frustration. The Invisible Man's involvement remained unclear.  The possibility of firing Earl was seriously discussed.  Audio clips featuring Bobby Knight and Earl Weaver's foul-mouthed rants were played.  A listener call from the Ferry itself complained about the delay.  Louise from Veruca Salt then joined the show in studio.  The conversation covered the band's history, previous appearances on the show (including an underwear-theft incident), a band breakup, and her new album.  Sexually suggestive banter ensued, along with a call about a technical audio problem, potentially linked to Earl's phone.  The segment ended with Earl finally arriving at the ferry and reporting in.  Spaz's porno casting call idea was briefly teased.

The next segment focused on Spaz's detailed proposal for an all-female pornographic film casting call, including "ringers" to ensure participation and a "mass lesbian-for-a-day casting couch audition."  The hosts reacted with disbelief and mockery, highlighting grammatical errors and Spaz's misunderstanding of "gonzo." Callers offered absurd counter-proposals, including suggestions for physically assaulting Spaz and creating a snuff film.  Erica, Spaz's girlfriend, called in, expressing her shock and disapproval. A listener suggested shutting down a rival radio station's power grid, a proposal rejected for its illegality.

The final segment revisited Spaz's pornographic video idea, featuring extensive debate.  Opie vehemently rejected the idea due to concerns about the show's image and Erica's well-being. Spaz argued for the project, focusing on personal recognition rather than financial gain.  A tense exchange between Spaz and Erica ensued, escalating to the point where Opie and Anthony expressed concern for Erica's safety, using hyperbolic humor and references to *The Godfather* and Mike Tyson. Gary, seemingly connected to the project, briefly called in.  Opie and Anthony ultimately rejected the proposal. A "What Did We Learn Today?" segment mocked Spaz. The show concluded with an announcement of a WWF ticket giveaway.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027. WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Jeff's on the line real fast. Jeff, what do you got?  Hey, man. Great show.  Hey, thanks.  Hey, I got a joke. What do you call an Ethiopian with a yeast infection?  Uh, what?  Quarter pounder with cheese.  Did we ask for Ethiopian jokes today?  Huh?  Very good. Thank you, Jeff.  All right, thanks, man.  All right, buddy. There he goes, Jeff. 
[00:00:30]  We're not going to be taking Ethiopian jokes all day, are we?  Uh, no.  I think that's the type of things they do on morning radio in the middle of Ohio or something.  Wacky.  So, Anthony, did you see Jay Moore on Politically Incorrect Friday?  We finally got to see Jay Moore.  Yeah. It was on Friday.  No one knew when Jay was going to be on, so we all painfully watched Politically Incorrect every day last week.  I watched it right up until when they announced who was going to be on.  When I saw Jay wasn't going to be on, I tuned out because that show is a waste of time. 
[00:01:00]  Uh, Bill Maher is a, just a jerk off.  He's just not a nice guy.  He doesn't like anyone out, uh, outstaging him.  Yeah.  He doesn't like anyone that gets big laughs over him on the show.  He's horrible. He does that monologue at the beginning of the show.  Well, on Friday, he did a monologue, um, dressed as a gladiator.  This thing was so freaking painful to watch.  Yeah.  It's not even funny.  I mean, you and I, we're off the cuff trying to be funny.  We know there are a lot of times we just don't hit the mark. 
[00:01:30]  We understand that.  But, uh, Bill Maher, you know, this is all written beforehand.  Yeah.  Doesn't he read the material and go, wait, this just isn't funny?  I didn't even get half of the things he was trying to do.  Was he trying to be John Rocker dressed as a gladiator?  Like, was that kind of the premise of the bid?  Or, I didn't even know.  I don't know.  And it was just awful, painful to sit through.  It was horrible.  And then he has this, uh, psycho babble.  He doesn't know much about anything.  No, and he's holier than thou, because whatever his opinion is, is the right opinion. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Like, everyone else can add in their two cents on the panel, but his is the right opinion to have.  The most important.  Yes.  What a tool.  Jay saved that show.  Oh, without a doubt.  On Friday, because, uh, God damn, he was funny.  Yeah.  But you could tell Bill Maher wasn't happy that Jay was getting all the laughs.  No.  But we have, uh, we have a couple okay terrific mentions from the show, Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, Jay said he was going to do a few things.  Uh, on, on the show, uh, reference this show.  Right.  A couple of okay terrifics.  And, uh, well, the first one, I guess they were talking about condoms.  Yeah.  And Jay came up with something that was pretty funny, where, like, you know, no one's in a four-year condom relationship.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, after a few times using the condom, you just go, all right, this chick's okay.  Yeah, this, this chick's cool.  You know?  Yeah.  Or she's from Minnesota.  What could she possibly have?  You know, he's, yeah.  Jay Moore, not a fan of condoms in general. 
[00:03:00]  So I guess we pick up the discussion in the middle of that.  And, uh, check out for the okay terrific here.  Like he said, now, buddy, now, let's keep it real.  Now, you say after the eighth time, now, let's keep it real.  After you live with somebody, that's when you say, oh, she's cool.  No.  No way.  That's not what people are doing, though.  He's right.  People go, they use a condom.  I don't think it's eight.  I think it's once.  It's three or four.  I think it's like they use it once and they go, well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't know.  And then when she walks in the bathroom, you see her ass going in the bathroom, like, I don't have another condom, but look at that ass. 
[00:03:30]  You're like, okay, terrific.  You got it, you know.  Oh.  Oh, it's like that, huh?  Yeah, it's okay.  Lie, lie.  I guess unless she's a black porn star named Velvet.  Then you don't even weight one or two condoms.  Then you don't need condoms whatsoever because she's obviously safe.  Coolio had some chops to him.  Coolio, keep it real.  I would love to get Coolio on the show. 
[00:04:00]  Keep it real.  He's a pretty, he was funnier than Bill Maher.  He's not even a comedian officially.  Let's keep it real.  No, when you live with somebody, it's like Coolio.  But wait a minute, Coolio.  So, that isn't the way it is.  You know, Coolio's talking about the way maybe it should be.  Yeah.  But that's not the way it is.  People aren't using condoms.  All right.  And then the second, okay, terrific, which was the highlight of the whole show because it worked perfectly, Anthony.  Yeah.  This is how you use okay, terrific in a sentence, okay? 
[00:04:30]  Let's go to the tape here.  I mentioned in our last segment, in the womb, premature babies, that stuff.  Interesting, there's a big study that came out this week that said, you know, they've had technological advances in recent years that have allowed these preemie babies, very premature, up to 14 weeks, to survive.  And now they're finding that when they keep them alive by these heroic means, they grow up with incredible problems like cerebral palsy, autism, learning disabilities, blindness, deafness, you name it.  And, you know, I just think that that's playing God. 
[00:05:00]  People say the other way, you know, that if you stop a life, that you're playing God.  But aren't you also playing God if you enable a life that apparently God never meant to happen?  Well, if you go into labor, it's kind of meant to happen.  No, I mean, if a woman goes into labor, it's coming out.  But hold your applause.  Don't all clap now.  It'll screw up the tournament.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, but no, that's what I felt.  God wants to kill it.  God will kill it.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, Bill Maher, what an idiot.  Okay, terrific.  Isn't that playing God?  If you were born premature, you weren't supposed to be here.  What an idiot.  I got two kids in my family that were born premature, and they're perfectly healthy inside.  Well, then Jay went into the whole thing of how he was born premature. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, supposedly, Jay Moore, when he was born, like, his body could fit in his mom's hand.  It was like a baby kangaroo when they're born, and they have to crawl all hairless up into the pouch.  They're, like, have to make the journey from the vag to the pouch.  Yeah.  They're all blind, just crawling, looking for a teak.  Looks like he was really premature.  I think he said, like, two and a half months premature.  It was ridiculous.  It was premature, yeah.  His, like, lungs weren't working.  He had pneumonia all the time.  And there's Bill Maher saying that, you know, they shouldn't live. 
[00:06:30]  Ann and I just flat out hate Bill Maher.  Hate him with a passion.  I'd like to have hit him in that big wall forehead of his.  He thinks he's the funniest guy on TV.  Funny yet knowledgeable, Opie.  He's so smart.  Craig Kilbourne's funnier than him, and that's not saying much.  He, he, he, he.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I think Jay needs to get back to the NyQuil,  because he was shaking and twitching like a crackhead in Harlem. 
[00:07:00]  Well, let me tell you something.  Down in East Meadow.  Let me tell you something.  They, they caught the famous Jay Moore twitch on live TV.  We see that in the studio all the time when he comes in to see us.  All of a sudden, he'll just do that face.  Maybe that's the premature thing.  Yeah, I don't know.  He killed, though, Friday, and it was, uh, it was great to, great to see that.  Funny.  All right, Andy.  Jay.  All right, let's, uh, let's move on to all the stuff here.  2-1-2?  Yeah.  7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Don, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Don. 
[00:07:30]  I was at the Knicks game yesterday, and, uh, Tom Brokaw was there.  Yeah, Tom, a big Knicks fan, I guess.  We saw him when we went.  Yeah.  I went to, like, the one and only Knicks game I ever went to in my life.  He was there with, uh, some young lady.  Yeah.  And she would follow him out to the concourse area, and then she, uh, they were following him  back about after, like, 20 minutes, and then he couldn't find his seat.  He was, like, so, like...  Where's my seat?  Yeah.  So you're trying to say that, uh, Tom Brokaw was drunk at the Knicks game?  Uh, he looked at...  No, that's just him.  It's just Tom. 
[00:08:00]  He just gets woozy from working so hard.  I'm going to go do some shooters.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, here at the Knicks game.  Hey, give me another beer, beer man.  Beer man.  Beer man, get your ass over here.  I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Hey, I'll chug with you.  Come here.  Holy crap, I'm snotted.  This is just in.  I'm drunk off my ass.  I'm going to puke on Star Jones' head. 
[00:08:30]  He was sitting behind Star Jones when we went.  Yeah, well, that's where his, uh, season tickets are.  Yeah, and he looked all trashed and everything.  Mm-hmm.  He just looked...  I think that is just the way he looks.  You know?  He's got that, uh, drunken...  Well, because he just works his ass off, man.  Yeah.  You know?  Uh, how about that Charlie Ward?  Yeah, he saved the game, uh, yesterday, Mr. Brokaw.  Saved the game.  Saved the game. 
[00:09:00]  I was kind of dozing.  You were dozing.  I mean, I'm pushing the game.  You had no idea that Charlie Ward was the hero of the Knicks.  I don't know.  Next game yesterday.  Actually, I wouldn't even know who that is if you didn't write the name down.  All right, well, thank you, Don.  Uh, we lost Don?  Yeah.  Knicks looked good yesterday.  Ewing didn't really help us.  Blah, blah, blah.  Ah, useless piece of crap.  Tom.  Tom, you all right?  Hello.  Tom.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  You all right?  Yeah, I just scored some heroin.  I was shooting up some H before the...  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Bert.  Hey, Bert, what's going on?  Hello.  Bert.  Yeah.  How are you?  Hey, Anthony, how are you?  Good.  You're on the air, man.  I was watching that film bar show, and I noticed that that tight-butted Ancumster was looking  at your boy up and down, especially when he said he was born too much for sure he was 
[00:10:00]  a million-year-olds.  I was wondering if he's been up for the show.  Bert, I've got to ask, and don't take this personal.  Is it your phone, or do you have a stuttering problem?  It's a phone.  Oh, okay.  I couldn't tell.  Part of me thought you might have a stuttering problem.  I could.  All right, so what were you saying?  I wanted to know if your boy drilled Ancumster.  Oh, you wanted to know if Jay drilled Ancumster.  He was working those two chicks. 
[00:10:30]  He was totally working those two chicks.  He was a tight-ass Republican Christian.  Yeah.  You know, and as soon as he told me he was a millionaire, all right, it's lit up, man.  So I was just wondering if he was...  Yeah, he likes telling everybody he's a millionaire.  Yeah.  All right.  Take care.  I think he has a stutter, Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah, when that one chick said that she has a gun, Jay was like, ooh, you just got hotter.  And then he turned to the other chick next to him and was like, oh, you're hot, too.  I know.  He's trying to work both chicks at the same time. 
[00:11:00]  Completely working it.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  I think he told Coolio that he was hot at one point.  You never know.  Brian.  How you doing?  Good.  I just want to find out how I can get in touch with that Bill Maher because of his comment.  I was born with a congenital heart problem, 23 right now.  And, you know, I got some problems, but I'm perfectly fine.  I go to work every day.  What, were you preemie?  Yes.  Yeah.  I had a couple heart surgeries and you know what, I'm fine.  See? 
[00:11:30]  You're fine and you're working and...  I just want to kick his ass.  Distributing to society?  Nah, he's just an idiot.  Yeah, I wouldn't put too much into what he says.  Don't even worry about it.  He's trying to be controversial, I think.  I don't know.  Ann and I interviewed him in L.A.  And it was the lamest celebrity interview we ever did.  Yeah, that show should be off the air.  We're like, hey, Bill, your show's called Politically Incorrect, you know?  And what's the most, who's your most politically incorrect guest you've ever had on the show?  Well, I don't want to talk about anything. 
[00:12:00]  You know, I don't like talking about the people on the show or anything.  You know, politically incorrect, you know, you shoot from the hit, Bill Maher, you'll  say pretty much anything, you know?  You're not one to shy away from a subject.  Who's the biggest a-hole in Hollywood?  Who would you think is the biggest a-hole?  Nah, what's this line of questions?  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  I'm not going to say anything about anybody.  It's like your show's called Politically Incorrect.  Politically Incorrect.  Thank you.  What are you talking about?  Get off the show.  Yeah, probably because the answer was him. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  He couldn't say himself.  All right, Brian.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  He wouldn't even, this was during the time when the OJ trial was going on?  Yeah.  And he wouldn't even give us a, do you think OJ's innocent or guilty?  Right.  We asked everyone out there that question.  And he's like, well, you know, I think we all should wait for the, no, no, no, no.  What do you think he'll be acquitted or found guilty?  What do you think?  What do you personally think?  I'm not going to get into the whole thing.  Oh, wow.  You're real Politically Incorrect, aren't you?  That Bill douche ass.  That was scary when we were out in L.A. during that whole thing. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Every single celebrity we asked that question, they would not.  They refused to answer the question.  Yeah, Paul, he didn't care.  Oh, he's guilty.  Guilty.  Oh, bro.  He's guilty of sin, bro.  It's obvious.  He's a weak, so.  Yeah, he was the only one that would actually fess up.  Yeah, I remember.  But everybody else was so, well, I think we ought to wait for the jury.  No, who cares what it's going to be?  What do you think?  We're all a bunch of frigging, like, pussies. 
[00:13:30]  We're just scaredy cats.  Say the wrong thing and what, you'll be blackballed?  Don't worry.  Please.  Joe Piscopo still has somewhat of a career.  If he does, you really got to commit career suicide.  You got to say something about the blacks to get thrown out of show business.  Please.  Chris from Jersey.  I went to a taping of Politically Incorrect once, and the applause light is like the no-smoking light on an airplane.  You'd think there'd be a time when it goes off, but it just doesn't happen.  Damn things on the whole time. 
[00:14:00]  I know.  They're, like, trying to pump you up and everything.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jennifer.  What?  Jennifer, what's going on?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Oh, you're not playing by the rules.  You're not playing by the rules.  Did you talk to our screener?  Yes.  And what did you say when he said, what's your name?  He said nothing.  No, what did you say when he said, what's your name?  Oh, I said, no, my name is Jennifer.  It's Lisa.  All right, listen.  Very good.  Are you changing your name now?  Yes.  Okay.  All Jennifers from now on will be known as Wendy. 
[00:14:30]  Okay, I'm Wendy.  All right.  So if you're Jennifer, your official name for the O&A show is Wendy.  Okay, I'm Wendy.  Hi, Wendy.  How are you today?  I was listening to a phone warning.  Wait, wait, wait.  You've got to make believe your name's Wendy, so you've got to answer.  Wendy?  Hello, Wendy?  I think we just lost Wendy.  We lost her cell phone connection.  We will not respond to that name.  Oh, our buddy Joe Lyons from Comedy Central. 
[00:15:00]  You've given Bill Maher too much airtime already.  Yeah.  We just hate the guy.  We absolutely hate this guy.  We begged Jay Moore to just go at it with him on the show.  I was pissed that Jay was supposed to be on like Tuesday and then Wednesday,  and we were saying like Jay's going to be on, and it gave the show publicity.  For like two days, you had to sit through his dopey monologue before you realized who was going to be on.  Yeah.  Ugh, a monologue.  Speaking of Comedy Central, someone came up with something really, really funny. 
[00:15:30]  I want to read this.  It's from Vinny from Rosedale.  He writes in an email,  I'm starting to see similarities between the Opie and Anthony show and South Park.  Try and see if you guys can catch on.  All right?  So each character of our show is very similar to a character from South Park, Anthony.  Opie is Kyle.  He learns something new every day, the reasonable one of the group,  and is always trying to help his best friend Anthony, Stan, out of any situation, 
[00:16:00]  but ends up in more trouble.  Case in point, the IRS, $19,000 he owes him.  Anthony S. Stan.  He's always throwing up at the sight of a certain woman.  Let's call her Wendy.  Since that is a name we could use on the air.  Very good.  Psycho Mark is Cartman.  Always has to be the center of attention, loud,  mokes for the camera whenever he can.  Oh, thank you, Lord.  Crazy.  Stinky is Pip. 
[00:16:30]  Always getting in the way.  Jay Moore is Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat.  You never know which way he's going.  Loves to blurt out other names for penises and vaginas.  Penises.  Vaginas.  Butt sex.  Spaz.  Timmy.  Enough said.  Timmy.  Let me know.  Let me know.  Come on.  Dice is Chef.  Where all the words of wisdom come from. 
[00:17:00]  Jim Brewer is Mr. Mackey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Everyone knows Mackey has to be a closet stoner.  That's good.  Okay.  And then Rick.  Rick is Jimbo.  He overreacts to everything and isn't used enough on the show.  Rick doesn't overreact.  No, never.  And then that leaves just one.  And that leaves just one person.  He just threw something at me.  Earl is Kenny, Anthony.  Yeah.  You can never understand Earl on a cell phone.  And you guys are about to kill him off.  Very good.  Hey, we're still not allowed to talk about the situation. 
[00:17:30]  Vinny from Rosedale.  Rick?  I thought it was all out in the clear.  The listeners probably, I mean, I've gotten e-mails and phone calls.  Oh, here's that go on.  You know, remember that, Earl?  Remember about how long ago was that now?  Two weeks?  Let's take a break and we'll get something out of Rick, all right?  Yeah, let's see if we can get through this without any outbursts or flying bathroom stalled doors or anything. 
[00:18:00]  I can't believe this.  Somebody actually asked on the New York radio message board if they had Opie's address on Long Island.  Un-effing-believable.  That's great.  When are you moving?  Soon.  Are you?  Yeah, to be honest with you.  Out of the tree house.  I've got to figure something out.  The tree fort.  Opie's house is like a tree fort.  Do you ever go to Disney and go to the Swiss Family Robinson tree house?  That's what I'm living in.  And you're walking up the stairs. 
[00:18:30]  It's like wacky.  All you need is mirrors and that's a fun house.  I live in the house of the Seven Gables.  Yeah.  There's one part of the house where you walk upstairs to go to this room and you have to  walk over a little bridge.  It's like a stair bridge.  There's no apparent reason.  And then you're back downstairs and then you walk to the left and there's a room.  I think midgets...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think midgets used to live in my...  It does.  It's like some kind of wacky, wacky layout in there.  All right, wait.  This girl dated Bill Maher. 
[00:19:00]  Really?  Lori, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Real good.  I've got to tell you something.  I've never...  I've heard you guys a couple of times.  I just moved Janineet back to New York.  He's such a dick.  I'm sorry, but I couldn't take it any longer.  Bill Maher?  Yeah.  Oh, bad.  Yeah.  And he has these, I guess...  Do you think the producers are writing the material about people being born prematurely?  Yeah.  I was born prematurely and you know what?  I think he was, severely.  Now, you're saying you went out with Bill Maher? 
[00:19:30]  I went out with him four times.  Four times?  Yeah, I couldn't take it.  Where?  Out in California?  Yep.  What, did he like date you and stuff?  Well, he...  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Lori.  Bill Maher.  Bill Maher here.  No.  You want to go out tonight?  I'm having flashbacks.  They're bad.  Yeah.  I hear he does.  We'll go to Spago.  We've got a table over there at Spago.  We could go.  He was very good friends with Wolfgang, you know.  Yes.  Wolfgang talk.  It's going to be great.  I'll have him cook a special meal for you.  And then you could hob the Bill Maher knob, if you would, please. 
[00:20:00]  No.  No.  You don't do that.  Was there any sex?  No.  No sex?  No.  Would you?  You went out with Bill Maher four times and didn't have sex?  No.  I hear he likes just banging broads.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, but, you know, he's a little quirk, little guy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  All right, Lori.  Well, thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  There goes Lori.  You guys have a really cool show.  Keep it up.  We're trying.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We'll see if Rick wants to talk about the situation. 
[00:20:30]  I know.  We'll get to...  All right.  Hold on.  God damn it.  Let's break down.  Jerry, what's going on?  Jerry!  Yes?  You're on the air.  We've got to make it fast.  What's up?  Yeah.  I got myself a stamped envelope back for the wow stickers.  Yeah.  They're invisible.  Who packed them?  The invisible man?  What?  You got an...  An empty envelope back.  Wait.  You got...  The invisible man.  You got an empty envelope?  I got an empty envelope.  Those are the special edition...  Because I had to do about 12 of them.  Invisible wow stickers.  That's it. 
[00:21:00]  You did it.  You got them.  Invisible man.  Oh, that's funny.  Wow, that sucks.  Yeah, it does.  Do I have to go through this whole process again?  Send another envelope and everything?  Yeah, send another.  Yeah.  We'll make sure you get your sticker.  All right, Jerry?  Okay.  All right, man.  How hard could it be to put a wow sticker in a self-addressed stamped envelope?  That's how Earl's making up for lost time.  Some of the envelopes he just opens and sends the self-addressed envelope right back out again.  Right back out?  I thought he was mad because I asked for about 12 of them from my friends and I didn't get nothing back.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  Send something.  We'll send it back out.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jerry.  Bye.  Bye.  Speaking of wow stickers, we're doing another wow sticker stop today, Anthony.  Yeah?  We will be at the Staten Island Ferry.  Wow, that's going to be a nice scene.  Yeah, Staten Island Ferry.  If you're on your way home and you're taking the ferry tonight, make sure you get your wow stickers, okay?  Yeah.  Earl and who?  Invisible Man.  Oh, and the Invisible Man.  The Invisible Man.  We'll be there at 4.30.  Cool.  Obviously on the Manhattan side.  Staten Island Ferry, Manhattan side, 4.30 if you want to get your wow stickers, okay? 
[00:22:00]  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Hey, New York.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  Yeah, I got a Rockaway Bedding bed.  You going to get hooked up?  Yes, I'm going to get one very soon.  Seems like you had a good experience with Rockaway Bedding.  I'm going to follow your lead and have them take my old mattress out.  Yeah.  Get rid of it and give me a brand new one.  I just sit there and watch them do the whole process, right? 
[00:22:30]  They will do that.  I went to one of their fine stores in Brooklyn, Opie.  They have 140 stores throughout New York and New Jersey.  I picked out one of their brand name mattresses.  I got the Stearns and Foster.  King size.  They delivered it.  Set up the free steel bed frame.  Set up the entire bed.  It was perfect.  Everything but the sheets.  It was wonderful.  And, yeah, took care of the old bedding.  So you didn't have to worry about that.  Yeah.  You could buy anything there.  You need a headboard, metal beds, futons, day beds, electric beds, bunk beds, anything 
[00:23:00]  you need to sleep at any Rockaway Bedding store.  So what you do, Opie, you just go there, try out your bed, pick one out, and that's  it.  They do the rest.  And they got prices up to 65% below department store prices, Anthony.  You could shop in one of Rockaway Bedding's area stores or give them a call.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  That's 1-800-TRY-A-BED.  If Jay Moore and Anthony sleep on a new mattress from Rockaway Bedding...  Two separate mattresses.  Yeah, whatever.  So should you.  1-800-TRY-A-BED. 
[00:23:30]  Call system, go over.  Until you have any self-respect, aren't you embarrassed to yourself or your family?  Hopefully you have that today.  You live human slime!  1027-WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  Rick ran out of the studio, Ant.  Where did he go?  I don't know.  We've got to confront him about the situation.  Absolutely.  It's been a couple weeks now.  Let's see if he gets his ass back in the studio.  Mike, what's going on? 
[00:24:00]  Yo, yo.  How are you, Mike?  What's happening, fellas?  What's going on?  Hey, listen, Anthony, I caught Adam Ferrara Saturday night out of Governor's.  Yeah.  Where were you, man?  You said you were going to make me 8 o'clock, right?  Yeah, I was.  You were there?  Yeah.  I was looking around for you.  I was in the back.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you were hiding, huh?  Did you hand the plunger up to him?  Somebody did.  Yeah, that was hilarious.  Hey, listen.  You guys remember me?  I went and handed out flies when you guys first came from New York.  Of course I remember you.  Oh, yeah.  You guys have thrown it tremendously since then.  Oh, thank God.  You can't even get through anymore. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know.  I think the phones are all screwed up today because there's like 10 lines that aren't ringing.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, I know when I was down there, you didn't have no broads on the couch.  You know what I mean?  No, we've worked on the show a little bit since you started listening.  That's for sure.  Big time.  Big time.  I mean, nobody was even calling when I went on.  I mean, to be honest, you know what I mean?  No, you're right.  I mean, when we first got here, people just called in for requests.  That's right.  You know, and that drunk woman that hated you.  Oh, yeah.  That's still one of my faves.  All right, fellas.  Good talking to you, man.  Good luck.  Hey, thank you, Mike. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Eddie.  Eddie, you're next on NEW.  How are you?  All right.  What's going on?  Good.  I just received my, I thought it would be WOW stickers in the mail.  Yeah, you sent a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Yes.  And Earl sent you a WOW sticker back.  Great.  No, I got somebody else's self-stamped envelope with no WOW sticker, but I sent his.  I didn't open his.  I just sent his one along.  Oh, my God.  I mean, I know how to kill off black girl.  How?  I'm going to send a letter bomb and let it explode. 
[00:25:30]  No, no, no.  I'm only kidding.  I'm only kidding.  I'm only kidding.  All right.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah, send in another self-addressed stamped envelope and see what happens.  Can I write this time you dick?  Make sure you put one in?  Yeah, you can write that.  Attention, dick, whatever.  All right.  I love you guys.  You're great.  Oh, God damn.  That is the cheapest phone I've ever heard.  God.  A little high-endy.  A little bit.  Andrew.  Hey, what's up, O&A?  What's going on?  How are you?  All right.  This happened twice to me now with black girl. 
[00:26:00]  What happened?  Not once.  I sent the first time and I got the same one with no sticker.  The second time I sent two and I got two of them back with nothing.  So he sent back empty envelopes to you as well?  Twice.  Not once, but twice.  All right, Andrew.  Thank you.  I think a certain amount.  He's just like...  Just throwing them back in the middle.  Throw them back in.  All right.  Now everyone's just complaining about their stickers not being sent to them. 
[00:26:30]  Great.  Well, if you want to try to get a WOW sticker, self-addressed stamped envelope, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10106.  Just write attention WOW sticker or whatever on there, okay?  Right.  That address is on the unofficial Opin' Anthony website and the WNEW website.  Uh, okay.  Everyone's just bitching about not getting their stickers. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Did you guys check out Britney on MTV this weekend?  The new look.  She looks like a crack whore.  So dirty.  So doable.  And what's up with those fags in the audience screaming like little girls?  Britney was all over the tuba this past weekend.  Saturday Night Live.  MTV's doing all sorts of things.  Yeah.  I'm digging her new look.  Is it a new look?  Yeah.  She cut her hair a little bit shoulder length.  Uh-huh.  God, they want us to want her.  Well, that's, yeah.  And I hate them for it. 
[00:27:30]  I absolutely hate them for it.  Well, you're a little, uh, a little smitten with her.  I think everybody is.  Did you see her on SNL?  She looked great.  Yeah.  She looked great.  Hmm.  You're not into the Britney Spears hit?  Um, yeah, you know, she's hot.  But, I mean, oh, the music.  Can you get past that?  The whole image and everything?  I don't, I don't watch her for the music.  She's, I want her to totally dirty herself up.  I watch her for the cleavage shots, the, uh, the mid-trift. 
[00:28:00]  What is she saying about the, uh, lip syncing?  Oh, the delay on the screen above me.  So, if you listen to music and watch the screen, they don't sync up.  Do you ever go to a show and you watch the big jumbotron behind the, uh, artist?  And if you're sitting toward the back, the sound from the stage takes a little longer for you to get there.  Yeah.  It's like watching, you know, the carpenter banging the nail with the hammer from a distance and makes a sound when he's pulling the hammer up.  Yeah, it's a little weird.  Yeah.  And she's saying that's what it is? 
[00:28:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah, sure.  Well, you think she's lip syncing?  I think so.  I could care less.  As long as she looks good.  Why, are you planning on going to a Britney show?  I would, I would definitely stalk Britney Spears and stalk her and, uh, do some hard time.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She's going to be on, uh, TRL tomorrow, I believe.  Can, uh...  And, of course, yeah, playing Jones Beach, uh, June 27th through the 30th.  Can anyone say overexposure?  She's getting there, sure.  Let's enjoy it, though. 
[00:29:00]  Okay.  And then she gets overexposed, and then she's going to have to, you know, jumpstart a career,  and she's going to have to get, like, the Mariah Carey breast implants or, or pose naked in Playboy.  It's all coming.  She won't do that until we don't want to see her in Playboy.  What the hell happened to Mariah Carey?  Mariah Carey is doing everything now to try to get attention away from all these, uh, young Britney Spears, uh, singers.  It's, uh...  Mariah Carey's new video, she has her big, sloppy breast implants.  She might as well be naked.  She's dancing around some kind of penthouse suite or something. 
[00:29:30]  They're just, like, whoa, from side to side and stuff.  Oh, just.  Floppy, messy.  She's, uh...  Looking more and more like a whore.  Now you've got, like, Christina Aguilera, Brittany, all the new young whores for the new millennium.  Mariah's going to be in, uh, penthouse.  You think?  She's not even going to make the cut for, uh, Playboy.  Nah.  She's going to be in penthouse.  And she wants to be...  Doing a pea spread?  Oh, she wants to be in, uh, in those magazines.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  No way. 
[00:30:00]  You can just tell.  Swank.  Swank?  Yeah, being, like, swank or cherry.  Biggums?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  She's going to be in Biggums.  She couldn't be in that one.  No.  You're not big enough.  Hmm.  What was that?  Christina Aguilera wrecked our prom.  Teen pop star Christina Aguilera.  Seniors at Augusta, Georgia High School were delighted when one of their students won a contest to bring Christina to their prom.  Oh, they always do those wacky, uh, things like that with these, these little popette stars. 
[00:30:30]  But when the genie in the bottle star showed up, she acted like a full-blown diva, ruining the entire gala.  Uh, she performed only two songs, ordered a flunky into the crowd to remove any CDs of arch-rival Britney Spears,  and virtually ignored Colin Shapiro, the youngster who, uh, won the contest.  What's she supposed to do?  Hob his knob in the limo?  Well, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  If you agree to go to the prom with the guy, you gotta, you gotta make an effort.  Christina was rude, crude, selfish, and disrespectful.  Uh, Bebe Ballas, who helped out of the prom, said,  Huh.  Well, what the hell did they expect?  I, I think she should have made an effort.  I could not have been, ba-ba-ba-ba.  What's the big deal if she hobbed his knob in the limo?  It was clear that the prom was the last place Christina wanted to be. 
[00:31:30]  While getting ready, she kept hissing,  I can't believe I'm going through with this.  I can't go out there.  You sure this wasn't part of a wacky radio promotion?  It probably was.  This is like something, like the, uh, the old management would have got us involved with.  Bring Opie and Anthony to your prom!  To your prom!  Ho-ho!  Win the chance.  Christina, her road manager, had a huge fight over whether she'd do two or three songs.  And she gave strict orders, uh,  If the DJ plays a Britney Spears song, I'm outta here. 
[00:32:00]  Boy, they hate each other, huh?  That'd be a great one.  No, I think, uh, Aguilera hates Britney.  Britney's much more successful than Aguilera.  She was so busy complaining, she was 45 minutes late to the stage.  A prom guest fumed.  After her ridiculously short performance,  Christina was ushered to an interview area to meet with Colin.  He gave Christina a rose,  but she barely remembered this poor guy who was supposed to be her prom date.  She said,  Oh, you're the kid who won the contest? 
[00:32:30]  Handed him one of her CDs and moved on.  Oh, God.  The whole visit amounted to two quick songs and a cloud of dust.  Christina may be a big star, but she's a real zero in Augusta.  Well, come on.  Yeah, it's, you know, it's one of those dopey promotion things.  She shows up, but if you're gonna agree to do something like that, you gotta, you gotta play it out.  You can see this dopey kid.  I can't believe I'm going to the prom with Christina Aguilera.  He's, like, got all these, like, images in his head the night before. 
[00:33:00]  Without a doubt.  Oh, I'm gonna be in the prom.  What's my move?  I'm gonna give her a single rose.  And all of a sudden, we're gonna talk, and she's really gonna be into me.  And it's gonna last after this prom.  And then, uh, we're gonna drive home, and how am I gonna make the move for the kiss?  He's, like, he's working it all out, and she just hands him a CD and leaves.  Oh, you're the guy that won the contest.  I picture, how many times do you think he spanked it to the thought of him in the limo just pounding her?  Yeah.  Just plowing her. 
[00:33:30]  Probably had bets with all his friends, you know?  Dude, what do you think, man?  What are my chances?  She needs me.  She needs me.  Little Colin.  Colin Shapiro.  Oy.  Oy, they.  I ain't going out with Christina Aguilera.  I'm gonna wear my dress yarmulke.  Yeah, maybe a little butt sack.  Christina. 
[00:34:00]  That's what these things are, though.  They're those dopey promotional things that, uh, the companies hook up, or radio stations,  or, uh, the record company.  And they even don't honestly want to do this.  You think Christina Aguilera wanted to spend a night at a prom, a high school prom?  Then she should have said no.  With Colin Shapiro?  Well, a lot of these people can't say yes or no to things.  They're roped in for, uh, the year or two.  Christina.  Hello, Christina. 
[00:34:30]  It's your new promotions guy.  Hey, I want you to appear in front of a giant pop pop.  Okay?  There's a free satellite dish in it for you.  I got one.  A free.  We win it at any other game.  Well, when our old promotion guy, uh, sent us to a Super Bowl party, Anthony, we played it out.  Yeah.  We did, though.  But, you know.  We didn't stay there for five minutes, have a beer, and leave.  We realized it was a really stupid promotion, but, you know, we said yes, so we, uh, you know, we worked it.  And we ended up having a good time. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, here's a picture.  Let's see.  Contest winner Colin Shapiro got the cold shoulder from Christina.  Look at her.  She's wearing, it's a prom, and she's still got, like, the belly shirt thing on.  Look at her.  Imagine that.  She shows up.  Look at the picture.  I see that.  She shows up, and this guy's like, oh, man, I'm going to score.  I'm going to get laid.  She's wearing the belly shirt just for me.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Christina.  Let's go.  Would you go out to the limo?  You think you tried pulling something like that? 
[00:35:30]  Christina, do you want to, like, go out to the limo for just a little bit?  I really got to talk.  Oh, Colin, no, I can't.  No, my manager told me, like, just trying to blow him off, and he's trying everything.  Christina, I got some good pot.  Can I pin the corsage on you?  Here, let me put it on your chest.  Oh, sorry.  I caught the feel of Christina.  Yeah, you want to smoke some pot?  Yeah.  Let's fight the punch.  Christina, if we could go outside just for a minute.  Christina? 
[00:36:00]  What are we going to do about this?  Christina, look what I did to you.  Again.  Again.  But that's what those things are.  You know, what do they expect?  Anthony, what does a girl want?  Um.  Penises.  Yes.  Penises.  Yeah.  Buttsick.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Buttsick.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was supposed to go out with her.  I'm Colin Shapiro, damn it.  Christina showed up and blew me off.  Well, not in a good way.  She just gave me a CD and left.  I bought her a lovely corsage.  I'm Colin Shapiro.  I shined my shoes and wore my brand new glasses. 
[00:37:00]  She wore the belly shirt and I thought I was getting laid.  Ugh.  She gave me VD.  I know it.  I got the crabs from her.  Yeah.  And I'm itching.  And I got genital warts.  Ugh.  I even spanked out a batch before the prom so I'd last longer.  Cause two pumps and I'm done.  Ugh.  Now my yam bag is all itchy and rashy. 
[00:37:30]  Ugh.  She's a hot tamale.  She wouldn't put out.  Poor.  Ugh.  Let's go.  Oh.  I shaved my yam bag for her.  Ha ha ha.  I nared it all smooth.  Didn't have a hair on it.  Looked like a nine year old.  Like a clam shell.  Ha ha.  Like a Purdue oven stuffer.  Ha ha ha. 
[00:38:00]  Ha ha ha.  Fuck.  I was just fantasizing about putting a map of Guam on her belly.  Ha ha ha.  No.  And she totally didn't pay attention to me.  I'm Colin Shapiro.  The contest winner.  Ha ha ha.  Show me that balloon knot.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Yeah.  I had all my lines set up.  Like, here's your cassage, sweetie. 
[00:38:30]  And here's a rose.  And suck it, baby.  Everything preplanned.  The whore.  Ha ha ha.  Genie, rub my bottle.  Ha ha ha.  I got a bottle.  Ugh.  Ha ha ha.  Whore bag.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  I got a genie in my pants.  Ha ha ha.  And a rash from you.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Where's Britney? 
[00:39:00]  So who's most likely to dance with the pole?  Britney Spears or Aguilera?  I don't know.  This is almost shaping up to be one of those Debbie Gibson, Tiffany battles, where one will  kind of have a career that will go on a couple of years longer than the other.  Who really won that one?  Uh, well, you know, it was, in the long run, neither, uh, emerged victorious.  But, at the time, it was definitely, uh, Debbie Gibson that won. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Because I think Tiffany was back in the malls, uh, but working, you know, at a Gap or something.  After, like, a month.  And an Orange Julius.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, weren't you Tiffany?  Shut up.  Shut up.  What do you want?  You want a large?  Yeah.  Yeah, large like your ass.  What happened?  Did you see that, uh, Whatever Happened To show?  Yeah.  And they had Tiffany on there.  It was like, oof.  She was cute for five minutes.  You know, she just had that fiery red batch. 
[00:40:00]  Looked like she was perpetually on the rag.  Come on.  Come on.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hi.  I found out according to, uh, her website that Alex was the guy who didn't want to be  with her.  The guy who was acting like, uh.  Oh, please.  Any one of us would, would bang a, uh, a teen slut.  It's either that he's, uh, that the website's lying or he's gay, so. 
[00:40:30]  No, that's, that's a crock of crap.  Yeah.  You're 17, 18, going to your prom with, like, uh, Christina Aguilera.  You want action.  Oh, definitely.  You definitely want action.  I mean, look at this guy.  He's in his little, uh, tuxedo or his little suit.  He's got, uh, Christina Aguilera in front of him.  What?  You think he's just going to say, uh.  In a belly shirt?  Yeah, I didn't want her.  And we all know she goes.  You can just tell she goes.  Unless there's something wrong with him, then yeah, he would.  She went out with, like, Fred Durst.  You know she goes. 
[00:41:00]  Please.  He does it all for the nookie.  The nookie.  That cookie's like a chocolate chip now.  Hey, what?  Eating and raggy and melted.  Hey, what does a girl want?  Huh?  What does a girl want?  Uh.  Hmm.  Half.  All right, Jeff.  All right.  Syndication now. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Jeff, what's going on?  Yeah, how you guys doing?  Good.  I don't like how you guys are making fun of this Ronald Shapiro character, I'll tell you  the truth.  What, Colin Shapiro?  Yeah, you guys.  Colin Shapiro.  Shapiro?  To you, damn it.  Oh.  She gave me genital warts, and I had them burnt off with a laser.  Oh, it's tearing the ass out of me.  I'm dying over here.  That's crazy. 
[00:42:00]  Yo.  I don't.  Oh.  I was very injured at my prom.  She injured me.  She kicked me in my yambag when I went to Copperfield.  After Fred Durst had her, I don't think he left anything for us.  Yeah, I think I can kick your ass.  Something tells me Fred Durst is, uh, leaves, uh, he's one of those scorched earth policy guys.  You know, where you move on, you don't leave anything for the enemy.  You just burn it and move on.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Abso-effing-lutely.  I can't adjust, but that's a reject.  I can't adjust, but it's like the locust. 
[00:43:00]  You know, just sleeps in.  There's nothing left but dried up stalks burning in the sun.  Just tattoos her vag.  Fred Durst was here.  Oh, my God.  We got to do a remix here. 
[00:43:30]  As soon as he gets into the nookie part here.  Yeah.  Fred Durst having sex with Christina Aguilera.  Here we go.  Get ready.  First time.  I'll dance.  But, say.  Boa-t-sag.  Boa-t-sag.  Boa-t-sag.  Boa-t-sag.  How would you like them all by the law? 
[00:44:00]  Please.  Christina Aguilera is a type of girl, this is from Scissor, the type of girl you want  to get a Hummer from, and then once finished, punch her in the head.  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:45:00]  Uh-oh.  You know, I like that Fred Durst, but I think he's a little too rough on the women.  You think, Mike?  Mike Tyson, everyone.  Yeah, that's a little, you know, I like a little foreplay myself.  Yeah.  You know, a little bit of the rice and lefts to the vulva and uterus, but that man is out  of control.  I like that, Christina Aguilera.  You do?  I would like to date her.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd take my big boot and stick it off her rectum and turn it around. 
[00:45:30]  I'd do like a pirouette in her butt.  And then, of course, I would go with the usual beating of her breasts and then punch it in  her face.  And you know that belly that's always exposed?  Yeah.  That thing would look like a skating rink when I was done with it.  Iron Mike would unleash a skating rink.  And then, I'd like to finish it up with a tender moment with the girl after I'm through.  Uh-huh.  Right before she slips into unconsciousness, I'd beat her over the head with a spade shovel. 
[00:46:00]  That's how they leave knowing that it was with Iron Mike Tyson.  Butt-seg.  Jesus, man.  Was she really with Fred Durst?  Uh, Fred Durst says no, I believe.  A lot of rumors.  Carson?  Supposedly, uh, Carson got his, uh, knob hobbed.  When is the devil supposed to come up and take Carson's soul? 
[00:46:30]  Is that happening sometime, uh, in the next few years?  I don't know.  When did he ink that deal in blood?  He's a star.  Jennifer Love Hewitt.  He's a star, Anthony.  Getting all the hot women in Hollywood.  I think he TF'd, uh, her?  Jennifer Love Hewitt?  Are you jealous?  Because there was a time you liked her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, you know, you gotta look at, uh, every ad that, uh, was out for that, that  I Know What You Did Last Summer movie, uh, they just showed her breasts. 
[00:47:00]  And Carson, you know, to be able to walk around New York and see those posts and just go,  yeah.  I TF'd that.  I TF'd those.  You know?  Again.  Eee!  Look what I did to you again!  I'm sploothing over here now!  Alright, man, we gotta take a break, so.  Again?  Yeah.  Again.  We haven't broken, like, 40 minutes here.  We talked about Christina Aguilera today, Britney Spears. 
[00:47:30]  Christina.  Uh, Hitler mustache?  Triangle?  Mohawk?  Wood floor?  What do you think?  Um, she is, uh, wood floor all the way.  Whoa.  Britney Spears, very innocent, uh, well-crimmed triangle.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Only in Hollywood can you have somebody else do everything for you, even adjust your bra.  Jennifer Love Hewitt gets a realignment while filming the movie Breakers at a downtown L.A.  gas station.  Yeah, look at that.  Some chick is, like, tightening up her bra.  She's got her shirt pulled up. 
[00:48:00]  How big do you have to be to get a realignment of your bra?  Look at that belly on that chick.  She could take two or three punches before she pukes, I bet you.  All right, man.  We've got to regroup.  If you're heading to the Staten Island Ferry, we're going to be there today, giving out the brand new Wow stickers.  Earl and the Invisible Man will be there at 4.30 on the Manhattan side.  So, pick up your Wow stickers, Staten Island Ferry, starting at 4.30.  I hope Earl left already. 
[00:48:30]  All right, Ann, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and they're my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Both of you here and Anthony.  What a couple of ass wipes.  1-0-2-7.  All right, Anthony.  One of these days, we'll have it all figured out around here.  Yeah.  We've been announcing for the last two hours that we're doing a Wow sticker stop at the Staten Island Ferry on the Manhattan side. 
[00:49:00]  We said that Earl and the Invisible Man would be there at 4.30.  And what's up?  Well, as we took a break there, I walked into the hallway and bumped into Earl.  What?  He hasn't left yet.  We've only been talking about this the last two hours, so.  What's going on?  Is he leaving now, Rick?  He said he's frustrated just having to think about a conversation with Earl. 
[00:49:30]  Go ahead.  He talked about saying how he was thinking of leaving at 3.30, but then was told by someone to wait until people start leaving work.  And he should probably leave about 4.45, but he wasn't sure what he should do.  So why wouldn't he ask someone from our show?  Because it's all about our radio show.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.  And why would he leave at 4.45?  Midtown is a complete nightmare at 4.45. 
[00:50:00]  He wouldn't get there until I see.  And what else is he doing that he can't just leave at 2.30 and hang out there all day?  I like leaving in the heat of rush hour.  So, I don't know.  Screw it.  If you're going to be on the Staten Island Ferry, you might get a wow sticker.  Look, why bother?  Why even bother trying to do stuff?  No one communicates with anyone.  We're announcing for two hours that he's going to be there at 4.30.  I walk in the hallway. 
[00:50:30]  He's hanging out.  He's hanging out.  And then he gets pissed when we ride him.  Goes and cries and hides and stuff.  Hides in the stairwell.  Hides in the stairwell.  Stairs off bathroom stall doors.  Oh, wait, no.  That was right.  Sorry.  So, I don't know.  Staten Island Ferry, Manhattan side.  Eventually, Earl will get his ass down there with the brand new wow stickers, okay?  Eventually.  And I'm sure we can all look forward to another great phone call from Earl from the road. 
[00:51:00]  From the crappy phone?  With the distorted cell phone that we've been talking about for three, four weeks, but no one has done anything about that either.  We've even had people from companies that want to help out and offer free cell phone to Earl.  I think the problem is Earl.  I think he doesn't know how to use a cell phone.  He yells into it.  He screams into it, and he has a right of a gun so as well.  I'm sorry, but he doesn't know how to use a cell phone. 
[00:51:30]  What?  What, Earl?  So, lots of stuff to look forward to today.  Another horrendous, horrendous, you know, call from Earl.  Earl is still...  Earl, we've got to kill him.  What are you leaving?  Earl, what are you doing here still?  He's in the hallway.  What are you doing here?  I'm waiting for Mark.  You're waiting for Mark?  Morpheus, how the hell are you going to get down there in 20 minutes?  How long is it going to take you to get there, Earl?  Take the West Side Highway, just.  Take the West Side Highway down.  So, you'll be there by 5 now? 
[00:52:00]  You don't know.  I've been ready for an hour.  I'm sorry.  What have you been doing?  What have you been doing?  Sending out wow mail.  You've been sending out the wow mail.  Here he is.  Supposed to be somewhere else.  But he's here.  Earl, you've been doing the wow mail, right?  I just got to ask this, and this is not even going to...  I'm not trying to bust on you, okay?  Just answer honestly.  You've been doing the wow mail, right?  Everyone's sending their self-addressed stamped envelopes for the wow stickers, okay? 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  Have you been listening to the show while doing that?  Yes, I have.  How many times did you hear us say that you're going to be at the Staten Island Furry at 4.30?  To which I...  At 3 o'clock...  No, no, no, answer the question.  Did you or did you not hear us say, hey, Earl's going to be at the Staten Island Furry at 4.30?  I heard it a couple of times.  So why wouldn't you come in and say, look, guys, you're saying 4.30, but I haven't even left yet,  and I was told to go later.  Why wouldn't you like at least working out to see what the hell's going on?  People are waiting there now for you. 
[00:53:00]  They're waiting there for you, Earl.  Well, it's the biggest part of their day to meet Earl and the Invisible Man and get the wow sticker.  Seriously.  If you're listening to the show and you hear us say that you, the person listening to the show,  is going to be somewhere at 4.30, and you know because you're the person that you're not going to be there at 4.30,  wouldn't you talk to someone about it?  I did talk to somebody about it.  Who?  You!  Just now!  Just now, when I saw you in the hallway, and you're arguing instead of giving the damn thing. 
[00:53:30]  Get him going!  I'm going.  Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl!  Earl, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm just, Earl.  Earl, Earl, Earl.  All right, listen, when you, when you use the cell phone, don't yell into it.  Don't yell into the phone.  He's going.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I just asked him.  Is Psycho Mark going with him?  I don't know.  I, he's saying, 3.30, that's the fastest 40 minutes I've ever seen in my life, 
[00:54:00]  because when you said, hey, hey, Rick, Earl's still here, and I'm like, oh, I'm like, Earl,  what are you still doing here?  That was our 3.30 conversation.  Didn't that just happen during the last pop break?  Yes, of course it did.  Don't say in the 3.30, that's the line.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Jesus.  He'll be there by 6.  He won't get there.  Be fair, guys.  Earl probably wasn't paying attention to the show.  He was very busy mailing out empty envelopes. 
[00:54:30]  There are people waiting at the Staten Island Ferry.  I want Earl's job.  Just fire Earl.  You've got to write him off the show.  Send Earl to a Latino neighborhood.  The Invisible Man, this just in from Frank.  The Invisible Man is at the Staten Island Ferry, and, yes, he is handing out the Invisible  Wow stickers.  Oh, cool.  But the Invisible Man, and the Invisible Man, nobody's there.  Anyway, like you said, he's listening to the show. 
[00:55:00]  He hears that he's supposed to be somewhere at 4.30.  It's now 10 after 4.  He's got to get down to the Staten Island Ferry in 20 minutes.  Not only that, but where's the van?  Downstairs.  That alone takes 20 minutes just to get the van out of the parking garage.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What, what, Ben?  What?  You got a microphone in front of you?  No.  He asked him what the hell he's doing. 
[00:55:30]  And then he gets mad at us.  He said he didn't know what time he was supposed to go.  That's what he told me.  All right.  Well, Staten Island Ferry eventually with Earl and Psycho Mark on the Manhattan side handing  out the Wow stickers.  Psycho Mark.  Can't wait for the call-in that will take place.  We look forward to it every day.  We ought to make sure we remember where those are taped.  So we tape Earl's phone calls and send them in because we might get an award for that. 
[00:56:00]  Best remote phone call.  Best remote broadcast.  Yeah, we may maybe get another air award.  Yeah, we'll send it in to the air awards.  We should do that.  Earl's on the spot reporting.  On the spot reporting.  All right, Bob, what's going on?  And Earl Douglas from WNEW's Opie and Anthony show.  Against all the people from WINS that, like, go to fires and do broadcast live.  Right.  I'm here at the scene of the high-rise fire.  Now, Earl will win.  And here's Earl's submission. 
[00:56:30]  I'm here at the last stop.  I'm here at the last stop.  Uh, Ant?  No.  Earl's calling in.  I don't know why.  He just left the studio.  Earl, where are you?  I'm over here now.  Okay, very good.  He's over here now.  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Yes, Ben.  I've been informed that Earl's real reason he has left is because Mark is running late.  And it's Mark's fault, I'm told.  Ah, yes.  That's what I'm doing. 
[00:57:00]  Of course.  Always someone else's fault around here.  Pass the buck.  Earl, what's the problem?  Stop it.  All right, Earl, a little pissed off.  Oh, no, no.  He's desperate.  But do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Earl, what do you want on this wall?  I'm talking to somebody that's at the Staten Island Ferry right now.  Did you get a sticker?  I got it from a Negro. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, maybe he is down there.  Where'd you get it?  I got it from a Negro.  Hey, who's on the line?  I'm the universal guy.  Hey, Bob, what's going on?  Hey, Anthony and Precious.  Yeah.  On CNN right now, they're talking, they're having a press conference about Bobby Knight.  Yeah, he's going to keep his job.  You sure?  Positive.  They announced that earlier.  It slipped out. 
[00:58:00]  Why?  What are they saying on ESPN?  Well, they're just kind of going a big long route, long about route, you know, saying that  they actually had a videotape of Neil Reed and, you know, I'm just waiting for the final conclusion.  We were watching before the show today and it leaked out.  One of his assistant coaches said something to someone and said, you know, that Bobby Knight's going to keep his job.  Well, I guess we'll find out in a few minutes.  Yeah, no, they said, okay, that he's going to keep his job, but he's going to be under firm guidelines. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, yeah, right.  And sanctions.  Whatever.  No, he's going to keep his job.  No, you know, more entertaining basketball.  All right, Bob, thank you.  Okay, bye.  We should play some of our Bobby Knight clips.  Keeping his job.  He is keeping his job.  It's official, right?  Under just what the guy said.  Under what?  Specific guidelines.  Under specific guidelines.  It's a slap on the wrist.  They don't have the balls to fire him.  They'll take a chair upside their head or something.  Or take some duty and shove it in their face. 
[00:59:00]  He's a madman.  We got some great Bobby Knight clips, Anthony.  Yeah.  A few new ones.  I collect Bobby Knight clips at this point.  I see.  Trade him with your friends.  We'll play the best one last year, but let's start with Bobby Knight talking about fat officials.  Fat officials.  Fat officials?  Yeah.  He has a problem with fat college officials.  You know, we got more fat-ass officials in college basketball with pants that are two sizes too small for them.  I mean, they look like they're almost reformed prostitutes trying to make a comeback with how tight their pants are. 
[00:59:30]  It's amazing.  You know, you see this big fat-ass guy out there, and you want to say, what are you wearing 36s for?  God, why don't you get a pair of 42s?  What could possibly start him on that tirade?  He really is the best.  He is the best.  That's pretty funny.  He's looking at the officials.  Fat-ass officials.  You think he's checking out their asses and stuff with the tight pants?  Well, you know, the fat officials must really love them. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, look at the yam bags in the front of their pants.  Boy, way to get the officials on your side, huh?  Yeah.  All right, here's another Bobby Knight clip.  When my time on Earth is gone and my activities here are past, I want they bury me upside down and my critics can kiss my ass.  Well, he's got some issues. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah, he does.  Why is he so angry?  Is there anybody now?  He's obviously not getting laid.  If you're getting laid and hummers and stuff, you're just not that angry.  I guess.  You're not getting it.  You get angry.  This clip, someone asked him about being a time bomb.  He's all over the place with his answer here.  Is Bob Knight potentially a time bomb like Woody Hayes?  Well, I think everybody is.  I mean, I think there are circumstances that could develop surrounding any human being that would set that human being off in an abnormal way. 
[01:01:00]  I think that we all hope that when such a situation would arise, that we can control our emotions or we can react to the circumstances in such a way that doesn't put either that person or people surrounding him in any kind of a highly embarrassing or difficult situation. 
[01:01:30]  What?  Huh?  What?  What?  I have no idea what he said there.  But why were they, see, I don't know much about basketball and especially college basketball.  Why were they thinking about firing him?  Because of all the allegations coming out.  They got a video of him choking one of his players.  Choking one of his players?  We got the hidden audio from the locker room we're about to play here.  How come a player can choke the coach and keep his career, but a coach, if he chokes a player, it's a bad thing.  Wow, look at you.  Oh, no, I remember that one. 
[01:02:00]  I always remember the chokings that go on in basketball.  Up close with Anthony.  Yeah.  On ESPN.  No question.  Who cares?  Whatever.  I just want him in the game because he's too entertaining.  He's too colorful.  He is funny.  And here's our famous Bobby Knight clip.  It's all over the Internet.  It's hidden audio from, I guess, his team lost again in the locker room, and he just lost it.  Check this out.  What a poison.  I'm getting the f*** out of here.  I mean, if you're not going to recover Greg Graham, if you're just going to let him drive by you, if the rest of you are going to let him catch the ball outside the three-second lane and drive all the way in here without one guy challenging him, then I'm leaving. 
[01:02:30]  And you f***ing guys will run until you can't even fucker.  Now, I'm tired of this s***.  I'm f***ing f***ing tired of an 8-10 record.  I'm f***ing tired of losing to Purdue.  I'm not here to f*** around this week.  Now, you may be, but I'm not.  So I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night, you aren't going to believe the next four f***ing days. 
[01:03:00]  So I am not here to get my f***ing beat on Monday.  Now, you better f***ing understand that right now.  This is absolute f***ing bulls***.  I'll f***ing run your f*** right into the ground.  I mean, I'll f***ing run you.  You'll think last night was a f***ing technique.  I had to sit around for a f***ing year with an 8-10 record in this f***ing lane.  And I mean, you will not put me in that f***ing position again. 
[01:03:30]  Or you will goddamn pay for it like you can't f***ing believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  Oh, man.  God, you don't even want to hear that from your father, let alone your coach.  Well, it sounds like one of the father rants, you know?  Yeah, definitely.  He's yelling at you and you're like, ah, just shut up.  Shut up, I know, I know, I know.  Just take out the strap and hit me. 
[01:04:00]  All right, so, Anthony, this is just in from Dean Wormer.  Yeah.  From Faber U.  Bobby Knight is now on double secret probation.  You're on double secret probation, mister.  Yeah.  But Bobby Knight's going to keep his job.  That's what that whole press conference is about.  Choking somebody.  And they got video on that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was it during a game or?  No, I think it was practice on that one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  God, I want to see that.  So. 
[01:04:30]  The president of the college is telling Bobby Knight that he's got to be nice to the press  and the IU employees.  If not, he will be terminated.  David, that's the conditions of keeping his job.  He's got to be nice to the press.  Well, then he will.  That ain't happening.  He'll get fired.  Guys, could you please play the Earl Weaver interview again?  Yeah, we might as well.  Oh, Earl Weaver, yeah.  If we're playing the audio clips.  This is actually Earl Weaver, the old Baltimore Orioles coach. 
[01:05:00]  I don't know.  He did a segment on a local radio station called, I don't know, Coach's Corner or something like that.  Yeah.  And this is actual audio from one of those segments, Anthony.  We'll play this as we go to break.  Up next, don't go anywhere.  Spaz came to us with another idea for the radio show.  Yeah.  This one is absolutely incredible.  I think this one beats them all.  We'll get into it next.  Spaz comes to us from time to time.  He types up ideas for the radio show.  Yeah.  You're just not going to believe what he wants to do for us. 
[01:05:30]  Okay?  All right.  But here's Earl Weaver.  Right now, the manager's corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager,  the Orioles, Earl Weaver.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer.  From Frederick Merrill, he wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out  and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get some goddamn little fleas on a f***ing basis, 
[01:06:00]  getting picked off, trying to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big f***ers that can hit the f***ing ball out of the ballpark,  and you can't make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C. wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in f***ing baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the f***ing goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his f***ing ass for eight innings 
[01:06:30]  and enjoy watching a baseball game, just like any other fan,  and has the ability to get up there and break one open in the f***ing night.  So if this f***er's mind his own business, and let me manage the f***ing team,  we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl,  but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the f*** her next lady's coming from  rather than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from. 
[01:07:00]  She'd get her ass out to f***ing bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street.  She might get a f*** stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go f*** yourself and the f*** with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball F***ing Network.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer. 
[01:07:30]  1027 WNEW.  Oh, boy.  Earl's not still here, is he?  He's in the garage.  It's my fault.  What do you mean it's your fault?  He's waiting for me.  Why is he waiting for you?  Because I'm supposed to go with him.  Dude, we're supposed to be there at 4.30.  If you have too much work to do.  If you have too much work to do, then he should have just gone without you.  Yeah.  That's how that should have worked.  See, if we're telling everyone we're going to be somewhere at 4.30 
[01:08:00]  and you guys don't leave until 4.30, that's a problem.  Oh, boy.  Oh, forget it.  Oh, boy.  Anthony, the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Yes, Opie?

[01:09:30]  Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  We're obnoxious little assholes.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, if you have anything for the show.  Brian, what's going on?  Yeah, tell us, two morons.  I'm switching to another radio station.  I'm sitting at the Staten Island Ferry, and I can't take it anymore.  You're waiting at the Staten Island Ferry for the WOW stickers, right?  Yes, I am.  Well, we've just been informed that Earl still hasn't left. 
[01:10:00]  He's downstairs in the van waiting for Psycho Mark.  He'll get there in three minutes, right?  And now Psycho Mark is saying it's all his fault.  Hire new people.  All right, thank you, Brian.  Bye.  So now there's no way they're going to get there before what?  It's going to take at least 45 minutes.  At least.  What?  We got to call him on the cell phone?  Rings a couple times, and all of a sudden, poof, it goes off.  Because it's got caller ID, so he knows who's calling.  He's a prick when it comes to stuff like that, getting them on the phone, on the air like that. 
[01:10:30]  So what?  Well, we'll just keep re-dialing until he answers?  Ben just paid for the page.  I don't want to know why they haven't left yet.  We've been telling everyone 4.30.  This is me there in two minutes.  Two minutes from right now.  Stop.  Hey, Earl.  Earl.  Yes.  Where are you?  Is that Alan Curry?  Give me a sticker.  We're on the road.  We're on our way there.  Where are you, Earl? 
[01:11:00]  We just left.  Just left.  Like, where are you?  Right now.  Right at this second.  I bet you're not even out of the garage.  You're hung up on me.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  We're encouraging a lot of people to go to the Staten Island Ferry.  Man.  Earl wants to play a little game and hang up on us.  We encourage everyone to go to the Staten Island Ferry for the wow stickers today. 
[01:11:30]  And just harass the hell out of Earl.  Yeah.  He wants to play a game and hang up on us and stuff.  Nothing.  No.  No.  Just burp and win for it.  Burp and win.  We're playing a new game on the Opie and Anthony show today.  At the Staten Island Ferry, whenever they get there, it's going to be a while.  It's a game called Make...  Black Earl Cry.  Cry.  Yeah.  Make Earl Cry.  I like Spazman Charger. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, my God.  What is he typing?  Earl.  Oh.  Why are you hanging up on us?  I didn't hang up on you.  Oh, see?  Now he's hands on fire.  You're lying.  I swear to God, I didn't hang up on you.  Where were you right when we said, where are you?  We're on 55th and 7th.  We're heading down 7th Avenue now.  I swear to God, I didn't hang up on you.  And where are you right now?  We're actually approaching 47th.  47th.  How long is it going to take you to get to the Staten Island Ferry? 
[01:12:30]  20 minutes.  20 minutes.  You want to make a bet?  You want to put your job on that?  No, I'm not going to make a bet.  I don't know, guys.  We'll do this.  You don't get there in 20 minutes.  You don't get there in 20 minutes, you're fired.  You may get there in 20 minutes, you get a big raise.  I'll make that bet right now.  I don't want to make that bet.  I can't make that guarantee.  It's 4.30 now.  You will not be there until 5.15.  I will not be there by 5.  I'm not going to make that bet.  I can't guarantee that.  There's no guarantees with the traffic. 
[01:13:00]  Well, a lot of people are already there, so now they're going to have to wait because  you guys have decided to get there right now.  I apologize.  All right, Earl.  Have fun down there.  But I swear to God, I didn't hang up on you, guys.  Have fun down there.  Have fun for Make Black Earl Cry.  Live from the Staten Island Ferry, Manhattan side.  All right, Earl.  And if anybody's going to be down there with a cell phone, please give us a call so we  can hear the festivities on a good phone and one where the guy holding the phone won't 
[01:13:30]  hang up on us when he gets a little cranky.  I didn't hang up on you.  You have.  No, I have in the past, but I didn't hang up on you then.  Uh, this just in, uh, or on West Side Highway, backed up like it is every day just before  rush hour.  Gosh.  Guys, guys, I did not pick the time.  You'll be there in time for the 715 ferry.  Great.  That's good.  You didn't pick the time.  We picked the time.  We said 430.  That means you leave at 330.  It'll be on the same side.  Three different times. 
[01:14:00]  Three different times.  No, we were saying 430.  I understand that.  I don't care what people are saying off the air, if we're on the air saying, Earl is  going to be somewhere at 430 and you know you're not going to be there at 430, then we  have a problem.  Oh, boy.  He's got nothing to say.  Thank you, Earl.  Have fun at the Staten Island ferry whenever you get there.  Have fun.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Now he hung up on us.  Guaranteed that one. 
[01:14:30]  What are we talking?  You know something?  I'm getting a few emails from Hicksville and Jersey and stuff.  You're getting tons of static and your signal's cutting in and out.  Is that true?  That's Earl's phone.  Is that just Earl's phone or is it, uh, I think your radio station just got infected  by Earl's disease.  The station's coming in all fuzzy.  Sounds like Earl's cell phone.  It's really annoying.  That would make sense because they usually wait until we're on the air to start tweaking with  the signal because not many people are listening to us or anything.  What's up with your signal?  I feel like I'm listening to Earl's phone. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, our signal's screwed for some reason.  Do we have an engineer who's, uh, working on this or is the coffee machine, uh, need a  refill?  Oh, my God.  The sound coming from the radio for you for, like, two minutes was like some electrical  S was going around.  Really?  Is there, like, a storm or something coming up?  I don't see anything outside.  All right.  Let's go to Jay.  Uh, Jay, what's going on? 
[01:15:30]  Hey, Jay.  Yo, what's up, dude?  How are you, Jay?  Yeah, I was just over there at West Side Highway, man.  It's horrible.  Really?  I was in a parking lot.  I was, like, sitting, like, just...  Man, it's horrible down there.  They're going to have a fun time trying to get through.  Isn't it pretty much like that every day?  Yeah.  It's always like it this time.  Between, like, 3.30 and, like, 5 o'clock, you can't get anywhere.  Yeah.  Down there?  Yeah.  Come on, down there?  Down by, like, uh, Bigfoot World Trade Center, you know, over there?  Where they're doing a lot of highway work?  It's horrible.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  No problem, man.  Later. 
[01:16:00]  Bye.  Yeah, dude, I'm just getting...  Letter after letter.  Keith!  Yo.  The signal is breaking up?  Yeah, it's all screwed up.  Is it still?  Because I'm getting somebody saying it's clearing up.  It's like a crackling sound.  But it was a feedback buzz.  Static and squeal.  Yeah, it's like a stately squeal thing.  Yeah, it's not happening right this second, no.  Okay.  You sure it wasn't Earl's cell phone?  What?  Was it when Earl was on the cell phone?  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  It was?  Yeah, when Earl was on the cell phone, it was happening.  Anna from Mount Vernon.  Remember Gilligan's Island when Gilligan picked up radio signals on his teeth?  Yeah.  That's what you sounded like just before.  Oh, good.  Now, was it the Gilligan picking it up on his teeth?  Or was it the episode of the Partridge Family when Laurie had the braces and was picking up radio signals?  Well, it happened in both shows.  I know, but what did we sound more like?  Oh.  Thank God we weren't doing any of our A material there. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Thank God.  It wasn't like when Brewer was in or something.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  I saw a giant mosquito gnawing at your antenna.  Maybe that was it.  Or we're broadcasting too close to cancerous live wires.  All right, Ed, this is what we're going to do.  Yeah.  We're going to go to break, make sure our signal is okay.  We're going to check with the engineers.  We're going to come back with Spaz's idea for the show, which is just unbelievable.  Yeah, and then he's outside screaming, it's a good idea, when we talk about it.  All right, I'll give you the idea, but then he writes up a whole one sheet about it, okay? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, it's a proposal.  But I'll read what Spaz's idea is, and I don't think anyone's going to change the station.  Spaz wants to have a porno casting call.  That's all I'm going to say.  Porno casting call.  We'll get into it next, okay?  As we regroup here, why don't we give away some wrestling tickets?  Make sure Spaz hangs up on all the people talking about the bad signal and all that.  Winner receives a pair of tickets to see SmackDown Tuesday, August 8th, at the Continental Arena.  Before you can buy them, Anthony, tickets go on sale for this WWE event Saturday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster, 
[01:18:00]  but the 10th caller gets a pair.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Hey, Anthony, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Hey, Anthony!  Anthony!  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Does three things, doesn't it, Anthony?  Ugh. 
[01:18:30]  You got me.  Your pal could have played another commercial, but you know, I said screw him.  You screwed me, man.  I screwed you, dude.  I was taking a leak.  You nailed me.  Nothing worse than hearing that you're supposed to be on the air while you're there in the bathroom.  You see who's outside, man?  Who?  Louise from Baruchasol.  Oh, I missed that.  Wait a minute.  An old friend.  We'll talk to her next.  Cool.  And then we'll get to the spaz thing as well.  But right now, it's Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, Anthony. 
[01:19:00]  Well, yeah, it does the three things.  It burns the fat.  Yeah.  Crushes the cravings to snack in between meals.  And it gives you a boost of energy.  A lot of people lately checking in about the boost of energy thing that Stacker 2 gives you.  Yeah.  I can't really read any of the email on the air because it's like, holy ass, it's better than speed.  Whoa.  And I don't think Stacker 2 wants us to be saying that on a daily basis.  No, no.  Obviously, you can't.  But that's one of the emails I read today. 
[01:19:30]  Holy ass, it's better than speed.  They get really pissed when we say that, bud.  This is going to kill you, man.  I know.  She's going to kill me.  Well, I use the Stacker 2 when I'm petering out late in the day to give me that boost of energy, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, I'm still able to function stuff.  Sure.  I don't think it's that strong, but it definitely gives me a little boost.  Boost energy.  And if you had a weight problem, it would help you burn the fat open.  That's right.

This is debauchery mania.  I like that.  Frosted aid exam for everyone.  I like that.  1-1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the O&A Show.  Eh.  We're going to get the spaz's idea in a second here, but an old friend stopping by the studio. 
[01:20:30]  Eh, look at that.  Wow, look at you.  I got to give her a hug, eh.  How are you?  Long time no say.  Wow.  The old Boston day.  Of course, we're talking about Louise from Veruca Salt, Anthony.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  This is my drummer, Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  You're new to the band, right?  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  The whole band changed there, Louise. 
[01:21:00]  I know.  Well, we got to tell everyone about you.  Yeah.  The last time we saw you, we stole your underwear.  Yeah.  And we haven't talked to you since.  You guys were, like they say in Boston, wicked pissed.  You look very nice with my underwear on your head, Anthony.  Yeah.  And I think we should repeat this someday, don't you?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, they were doing a show for us, and we talked her into giving us her underwear.  Well, because we had a bet, and then we were going to auction the underwear off. 
[01:21:30]  But I guess it was a very important piece of underwear.  It was.  You know, and it was perfect on my lovely behind.  Yeah.  And I needed that underwear.  It was, you know, it was a key staple underwear piece.  Yeah.  Yeah, so then we had to send some guy from the station all the way out where we were.  Well, you were two.  Like 40 miles away.  We were both tired and drunk and just went home.  Yeah.  And you realized you brought Louise's underwear home with you.  Well, no, I knew I had it on me the whole time.  And then we had to get a guy from the station to get her underwear back. 
[01:22:00]  Get her underwear and bring it back.  And we thought you were never going to talk to us again after that episode.  Oh, hell no.  I love you guys.  Yeah.  That night, I remember stage diving, and I had the full-on trucker butt happening.  Yeah.  The plumber butt, you know, with my pants.  And, oh, God.  In fact, I don't know if I had the underwear on at that point.  And I stage dove, and someone ripped a hole in my beautiful velvet purple pants.  Mm-hmm.  And, um...  They groped you.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  They groped you like crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Got back on stage and started giving the finger to the crowd. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, and I was like...  We thought you were insane doing that, like jumping into the crowd like that.  Did you?  Yeah, we thought you were crazy.  We knew what our fans were like.  Yeah, because it was all, like, listeners.  I think I was crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  I think I still am a little.  So, you're still drinking the, uh, what was it, Johnny Walker?  Um, I don't do the brown alcohol anymore.  Really?  Come on.  It was that and Ring Dings or something?  Or Devil Dogs?  Um, what the hell did we used to get you all the time? 
[01:23:00]  Devil Dogs, because Nina loved Devil Dogs.  Yeah.  Is that what you guys got?  It was Devil Dogs and Johnny Walker.  And Johnny Walker red, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Which, no, it was black.  It was black, okay.  That was our favorite drink.  It was.  Well, it continued to be, and I still love it.  But, recently, my guitar player and I, um, had an, shared an evening with Jack, Jack Daniels.  Oh, yeah.  And, um, I, I, I.  You ended up with, uh, your, your genitals shaved, right?  No!  Because, no, well, that, no, because I gotta tell you, that'll happen.  Any, any night with a bottle of Jack Daniels, uh, and for some reason you wake up and you're shaved. 
[01:23:30]  And it was a great idea at the time, but you're walking around for two weeks chafing.  It's like crazy.  Oh, God, that is so awful.  I save for the irritation.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  You like the irritation?  That's a twist.  That's very good.  I like it.  I like the chafing.  No lotion for me.  And he slays on drums, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Cool.  Where are you guys playing?  Bowie.  Bowie Ballroom, Wednesday night, and Birch Hill, Saturday night, see?  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, you gotta tell us what happened, uh, with Nina. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, come on.  It used to be, like, Nina and Louise, Louise and Nina, and now it's just, uh, Louise.  Actually.  And a lot of new bandmates.  We were both in love with you, and I won't say who was in love with whom, but we, we fought  over it.  Yeah.  And it, uh, it led to her just being so pissed that she left.  That must be the best story.  Going back to that, Aunt and I were convinced, like, two, three years ago when we were hanging  with you guys that, you know, we could have done you.  We could have, yeah.  Yeah, we were kind of delusional and thought maybe we had a shot or something. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  We were thinking that you guys were shy, and we were going to do you.  Really?  See, that would have been cold.  We were, where were we, where we were in the dressing room?  Uh, Fleet Center.  Was that Fleet Center or somewhere else?  Yeah, no, Fleet Center in front of, like, 20,000 people.  They dedicated a song to us.  Yeah, that was cool.  And Aunt and I are in the audience, like, dude, I think we could, I think we could get  some action.  Kind of getting a little overzealous there.  I think we were.  We were, like, in the Bruins, in the, uh, the Bruins dressing room.  Yeah.  The hockey team, right?  And there was, like, the little back area that was curtained off. 
[01:25:00]  And me and Aunt were like, we could get them back there, man.  We were, we had a whole scenario.  We'll take showers.  You guys are sleazin' out.  Well, the problem was we had to get rid of a girlfriend and a wife.  We would have been all right.  And then everything would have been fine.  Yeah.  We had a little Johnny Walker black, and we're showering.  Well, actually, um, sadly, because we were all very attached, truly, back in the day.  Yeah.  Um, she and I had a, uh, sort of a, uh, not pleasant parting of ways.  My, my headphones are really, like, staticky and bizarre.  Oh.  Something's happening here. 
[01:25:30]  The equipment.  We'll get to new headphones.  Blows monkey ass.  I'm sorry to have, to, to have choked for you guys, because our friendship was very strong.  And I think so strong, and to a certain degree, when it came down to business, commerce, art,  and, and intense friendship, and being tied to the hip every day, and basically being  Siamese twins, that we, we just couldn't sustain it.  And, um, and all boils down to just having had a lot of time together, being under a lot  of pressure together, and having great, great times together, which you guys really remind  me of.  And then, um, and then just, like, that, that time coming to a close, and, uh, to a certain 
[01:26:00]  degree, that time having exhausted itself, which I wouldn't trade for anything, and it  has propelled me into the next phase.  And, uh, thank God for that.  Hmm.  You know what?  It had nothing to do with, like, uh, banging the same guy right now?  Some dude.  No, he has you.  Being like the proverbial Yoko Ono of the, uh, of Berukasol.  Nothing?  Nah.  No, no guy?  Um, it's not working.  Yeah, because that's what all the rumors were.  You know, you probably read them all. 
[01:26:30]  She thought of that answer for a long time.  That's a great answer, man.  That was a prepared statement right there.  Prepared statement.  I have a statement.  Right.  I've been asked this question a hundred times, and I'm going to answer it like this.  Wow.  Yeah, that is.  We were very close friends, and I think we both let each other down in some ways, and  that's, that's sort of the, that was sort of the grieving part of it afterwards, just  feeling like, you know, we were carrying a torch for girls aligned with girls, and I  feel like we kind of choked, you know?  Wow.  And, uh, the fact that, that our friendship didn't sustain itself over, you know, the 
[01:27:00]  entire course of our lives, and I hope that eventually that we can come together in some,  to some degree someday.  Again, um, right now we're, you know, mildly in touch, but we're working on very different  projects.  Mildly in touch.  Mildly.  Well, how else can I put it?  We've come, we've communicated some, but, um, we're not hanging out.  You know, she's, she's made, uh, a record of her own.  I've continued with Berukasol, obviously, and, um.  You're still fighting the sea, though.  Yeah.  I, well, I, you know, that would be my namesake.  And, um.  Me and Opie have the same problems.  I understand that.  But we, we know, like, you know, we can't stand each other as it is. 
[01:27:30]  But we know if we walked away from each other, uh.  It would be, uh.  Yeah, it's, uh, yeah, detrimental.  We do it purely for the money.  That's right.  And that's it.  Boy, we're making so much money right now.  I can tell by your clothes that you guys are rolling in.  All right, Jimmy.  Exactly.  We're really sharp.  Calm down over there, Jimmy.  Where'd you get this guy?  So, what happened?  Did you like to know?  Did you battle it out over the Berukasol name and everything? 
[01:28:00]  No.  No?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It was just, uh, it was a legal understanding.  Really?  Now, if you leave Berukasol, you're not going to leave the name to, like, a roadie or something.  I'll take, I'll take over.  Yeah, because I'll tell you, it pissed me off when I went to go see Foghat and found  out that, uh, uh, a roadie owned the name or something.  Uh-huh.  And, and it's not Foghat, man.  Yeah.  You know, it's like some guy that used to carry around the drummer's drum key, and he's now  Foghat.  Slow Ride is one of the best jams ever.  Come on! 
[01:28:30]  But you gotta see Foghat do it, not like you.  That's weird.  Yeah.  It happens.  A lot of the bands do that now.  Really?  They give their name to the roadie?  Or whatever.  Or like Berukasol will be like some, uh, former Mouseketeers.  They'll get up there and...  Ooh!  You can't name any names.  Get up with Brittany.  Yeah, I wish I was on Brittany.  That's what I'm going to get off it.  I have enough testosterone in my life every day.  Yeah?  To get overloaded with it right now.  How is that for you?  Um, well, at best, uh, interesting.  And worse... 
[01:29:00]  Horrifying.  No one to really...  Yeah, you can just get on the road and not really have anybody to share those girly moments  with anymore.  I have Suzanne.  Yeah?  Yeah, and for some time after Nina and I split up, I didn't want to play with another  woman just because I don't want to...  You mean, uh, music, right?  Well, you...  I thought you were going to step into it.  Whatever you...  Whatever's going on in your little, you know, the theater of your mind.  Let me just hold that moment.  That thought.  Okay, and...  Can I cough now?  Does that work?  Yeah, if you hit that.  Oh, cool.  So you could, like, yeah, cough or curse. 
[01:29:30]  How come I can't hear it when I cough?  Because it cuts you off.  Oh.  See, we like the...  Can I hear it?  We like the coughs on the air.  That's for the professional broadcasters.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, hey, it's 4.52, time for the news.  Okay, thanks.  Hey, hit the cough button so you don't hear them cough.  It's like 10-10 winds.  They're all cough buttons all the time.  It's not that you got a real cough, like something would cough.  I don't know.  Sound effect?  We got a machine for all that.  We got other stuff.  Yeah, we got good stuff over here.  Yeah.  So if you don't cough, you don't get off.  It's like, hello, 10-10 winds. 
[01:30:00]  There's no button for that.  Well, we don't have a cough, but we got that.  We got that.  All right, so Nina...  You guys have changed a lot, right?  No, not at all.  You can tell, huh?  Did you hear what happened to us in Boston?  I heard that you guys...  Got fired, obviously, because we're here.  ...are too good from that station, and you moved on.  Yeah, very good.  I like that answer.  We told the whole city that the mayor died in a car crash.  Mayor Menino was killed in a horrible car crash, and he wasn't dead.  We found out a lot of people didn't have a sense of humor up there. 
[01:30:30]  It was April Fool's, so we figured we'd do a joke,  and the joke was on us a week later when they threw us out the door.  Well, I think you guys are the coolest thing that ever happened to that station.  Wow, look at you.  Thanks.  You know?  Boy, they didn't think so.  I did.  No, they hate us now.  We're going to come back on another station and kick their ass,  but that's a story for another day.  All right, so Nina left the band.  Now you've got to tell us what's going on.  You've got Jimmy over here, and...  I've got Jimmy, I've got Suzanne, and I've got Steven,  and we are just touring. 
[01:31:00]  I have a new album, Resolver.  It's out in stores tomorrow, Tuesday, May 16th.  It's also my brother's birthday, so it's a very poetic moment for me.  All right.  And I love the record.  I went straight into it after touring on Eight Arms.  We took like a month off, and then Nina and I split up, and I had about 15 songs ready to go.  And so I thought for a bit about whether to keep going with Ruka Salt, maybe a day,  during which time I talked to some people I respected a lot in the industry 
[01:31:30]  who gave me some really solid advice about why I should keep going with the name  when I was sort of feeling like I didn't have a choice but wanted to really understand why,  you know, to go forward with a good feeling about it.  I needed to talk to people and gather some good information and sort of advice about it.  So I went to the studio.  I decided never to turn back to, you know, reform and make this band stronger than it ever has been. 
[01:32:00]  And, of course, it's different, and no one is being replaced.  But I had about 15 songs.  We went to the studio.  So, first, I went with a drummer from Los Angeles, formerly the band Failure, which you guys probably know.  And his name was Kelly Scott, and he played on a few demos.  And then...  What happened there?  Oh, he was great, but he lived in California.  So a friend of mine said, you know, there are great drummers in Chicago, Louise.  And I said, like who?  And he said, like Jimmy.  And I had known Jimmy from a bunch of parties in Chicago and bar scene and stuff. 
[01:32:30]  Just parties, bar scene.  Yeah, exactly.  Actually, he's a great chef.  So I had heard that he was a great chef, hence his name Tasty J.  Word.  Word.  And he told you that was because he was a chef.  Well, I have since learned the truth.  Not firsthand, mind you.  Britney Spears told me.  Anyway, so I called him up, and I was like, Jimmy, you want to come drum for me, with me?  And incidentally, every time I saw him at a party, he was always, he'd always end up in the dress of whoever was having the party. 
[01:33:00]  He'd always end up in the dress.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I thought you guys would like that.  Yes.  Fascinating.  He'd have, like, the Darth Vader helmet on, and somebody's, like...  Bra and panties.  Yeah.  Really?  And he and...  How about that?  He and...  Hey!  Okay, terrific.  He did.  Not my panties, but...  Actually, one time he dressed up in my Marilyn Monroe lingerie that I hadn't even worn yet. 
[01:33:30]  And that is the brand name, by the way.  Really?  Yeah, it's very pink and very, very flowy.  Very frilly.  And Jimmy looked very nice in it.  But I was very disturbed when I saw him at a party one day, and he didn't have a dress on.  I was like, could you please go put a dress on or something?  A dress!  Somebody's, you know, like, nightgown?  And since then, he's become a, you know, a total dude, and I've gotten used to it.  But initially, I wasn't sure.  Anyway, he came in and played, and it was just, like, a no-brainer.  It's like... 
[01:34:00]  I fit the costume, so she was like...  Johnny Bravo.  Johnny Bravo, yeah.  He hits really hard, and he plays great, and we are very happy together.  As we are with Suzanne and Steven.  Definitely.  They totally kick ass.  And I feel like this band right now is more...  This incarnation of Rufusall is so focused, dedicated, and committed, and, like, communicative  in a way that is unprecedented.  She's psyched.  Psyched for the band. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  You've got to come by and, like, play for us next time.  Well, you know, I could play this.  I could play my sunglasses now.  I would have.  You know, last time I saw you guys...  You guys used to play for us all the time.  Yeah.  And I would have brought my acoustic, but no one told me to.  Oh, really?  Oh, see.  Well, how about next time you're in town?  Definitely.  Yeah.  I plan on it.  All right.  Do that.  Well, we've got to make sure everyone goes to the Bowery Ballroom Wednesday to see  Veruca Salt.  Yes.  Our friend, Louise.  Thank you.  I have a picture of you on my wall at home.  You do not. 
[01:35:00]  Swear to God.  And I take a lot of pictures with a lot of rock people.  You made the cut.  You're on my wall.  Very nice.  Well, I was excited to know I was going to come see you guys today.  Without a doubt.  It's weird to say that publicly, because I would say it to you off the air, too.  Yeah.  That was true.  I was like, oh, kick ass out.  I mean, this band gave us one of the greatest moments ever, dedicating a song to us in front  of 20,000 people.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  When you guys were warming up for Bush, remember that?  Yes, I do.  The Bush show, where it was just like Aunt Nye and about 20,000 girls under the age of 
[01:35:30]  14.  Right.  And you know what?  The cool thing is that many of those girls who were wearing the I Love Gavin shirts, the  homemade I Love Gavin tees, they're now playing guitar and starting bands because they  saw Veruca Salt open for Bush.  Right on.  And I see every show I play, like girls come up and they're like, I saw you play with Bush  or I saw you play at 930 or, you know, wherever it is.  And then I started a band now and here's my demo.  Very cool.  And it's so awesome.  And then they get into fights because they're having sex with the same guy, right? 
[01:36:00]  And then they break up.  That's you.  No, I just threw out a hypothetical thing.  It's like, what?  No, come on, stop.  You don't know nothing.  I know.  Look, you know what?  Come on.  It's funny because it was written everywhere.  That was like what was written.  Well, that's an unfortunate point, isn't it?  It must be.  Because you must have had to just like paw through that for a while.  Yeah, well, I basically just sort of like didn't talk, didn't like tuned out the rest of the world 
[01:36:30]  because I went through two very publicized splits that year.  Yeah, Dave Grohl.  You know, yeah, I had to bring it up.  And, you know, I prefer for my private life to be more private now.  So.  Good luck.  Thank you.  Yeah, good luck is right.  I'm off to a good start with you guys today.  This is fun.  Come on.  Oh.  I know it's fun.  Yeah.  I'll talk about my private life.  Let's see.  The picture that I took with you guys that Opie puts on his wall.  The underwear?  Yeah, mine was probably given to Goodwill when my wife threw all my stuff out. 
[01:37:00]  No, really?  Who got the dog?  My wife, Dave Grohl.  Really?  You were married to Dave?  I told you.  It's been a lot of changes.  A lot of changes since we last saw you.  Wow, you guys seem so hetero.  Well, big changes.  Big changes.  Big changes.  Told you.  We couldn't have you and we weren't able to get over that.  That's it.  Oh, I'm sorry about that.  If I can't have you, that's right.  I'm swearing off of women. 
[01:37:30]  If I can't have you, I don't want nobody.  There you go.  I can't have you.  Ho, ho, ho.  All right, so Bowery Ballroom Wednesday night, the Birch Hill Saturday night.  We've got to play the single off the album that comes out tomorrow.  Yeah, we should play a couple songs.  A couple?  If you give us your underwear, we'll play two.  You know we're not even a music station anymore?  I know.  Okay, so you probably can't play more than one then, huh?  We'll play one now.  We'll play Born Entertainer.  All right.  Off Resolver, which comes out tomorrow, right? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Farook Assault.  Thank you, Luis, for coming by.  We really appreciate it.  Thank you, guys.  And everyone go see Veruca Salt at the Bowery Ballroom Wednesday.  All right?  Right.  Born Entertainer, it's Veruca Salt on the Opie and Anthony Show on NEW.  All right, we've got to thank Luis from Veruca Salt for stopping by today, Anthony.  Yes. 
[01:38:30]  Very cool show.  Should be at the Bowery Ballroom on Wednesday.  Anthony, we're doing a wow sticker stop today at the Staten Island Furry with Earl and the invisible man of Psycho Mark.  I guess Earl has made it to the Staten Island Furry Manhattan side to give out the wow stickers.  Is he there?  Yeah.  It's time once again for another bad phone call from Earl.  Earl, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  We're right in front of the uptown train at South Ferry.  We're handing out wow stickers.  People are approaching us in droves. 
[01:39:00]  And so we give out some more wow stickers.  Oh, very good.  Are they being kind to you?  Yes, they're being very cool.  All right, Earl.  We're asking where's the invisible man and where's the loft and what have you, but things are cool.  Now, Earl, this is the 10th sticker stop you've done, more or less.  This is the first one where we can understand you on the phone.  Yeah.  What are you doing differently?  I'm using Rick's phone.  Oh, you're using a phone that works.  Yes, I'm using a beautiful Nokia 6160 phone.  All right, and your phone is a little bit away from your mouth, right? 
[01:39:30]  So it doesn't just thork.  Very good.  Very good.  And Psycho Mark's down there, too?  Psycho Mark is wreaking havoc, as usual.  You guys going to be there for at least another hour?  Yeah, we're going to be here until about 6 o'clock or so.  And, oh, my God, they're just coming in droves.  Very good.  Staten Island Furry, why don't you give the location, the exact location again, Earl?  We are directly in front of the uptown one train at South Ferry, right on the underpass,  where everyone has to go to Staten Island. 
[01:40:00]  Okay, very good.  Very nice.  We'll check in with you in a little while, all right?  All right, you guys.  Good job with Veruca Salt.  It was really cool.  Yeah, we like Louise a lot.  Good friend of the show.  All right, Earl.  We'll talk to you soon.  I'll talk to you in a bit.  By the way, you would have won the bet.  You would have got a huge raise instead of getting fired.  You made it there before 5 o'clock.  Psycho Mark.  You drove like a madman down here.  All right, Earl.  Psycho Mark.  Well, we'll talk to you in a bit.  Okay, guys.  Bye.  Take care.  There he goes, Earl.  I'm the Invisible Man. 
[01:40:30]  All right, Ant.  I guess it's time for Spaz's idea.  Yeah.  We couldn't make Louise from Veruca Salt wait.  So let's bring in Spaz now.  Let's bring in Spaz.  You know, when doing this show, we love to get new ideas for new things to do on the Opie and Anthony show.  And we'll take the ideas from anyone.  Listeners, each other, the people that work here, and, of course, the interns. 
[01:41:00]  If they come up with a good idea, who are we to say it's not a good idea?  We don't care where the ideas come from.  Right.  It is the people's radio show.  I'll go on record and say we get most of our really good ideas from our listeners.  From the listeners, absolutely.  Get a lot of the funny lines from our listeners.  And we rip you guys off all the time.  Yep.  Comes up on the instant feedback.  If it's funny, we're using it.  We're using it and not giving you credit.  Now, we may and Opie fight over your stuff sometimes.  Oh, no, come on.  Look at Bob from Jersey.  He's got a great line. 
[01:41:30]  It's mine.  We try to give you guys credit.  It's so funny, though, if we don't, you guys are right on top of it.  Yeah, and then they write back on the instant feedback.  That was mine.  You ripped me off.  You ripped me off.  That's why you wrote it, so it would make me air.  Shut up.  All right.  So we got another idea from Spaz.  Now, usually you would think somebody would have an idea and just kind of walk up to you and go,  hey, I got an idea.  Right.  And tell you the idea.  Right.  And you'd go, yeah, that's cool, or, you know, maybe not.  Spaz presents these ideas all printed out on the computer like an outline. 
[01:42:00]  It's presented like somebody would present an idea for IBM or something.  And we appreciate the effort.  We do?  Oh, we do.  Yeah, I didn't realize he knew how to type, but you do, Spaz.  Any formats at all out?  What was the last idea you gave us?  I can't remember.  Yeah.  Neither can wait.  Tell you the truth. 
[01:42:30]  Can someone check line two?  See what that's all about?  Somebody might have just saw a lady get hit by a car.  That's sick.  Wicked.  All right, so Spaz, your latest idea for the O&A show is the porno casting call.  Yes.  Don't say anything.  We'll tell you when to speak.  Please.  You did a one sheet for us to explain exactly the concept, the film, bonuses.  He's got little subjects and everything. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Little headlines.  It's like an outline.  So it's Spaz's porno casting call.  Yes.  Now, he presents these things, too.  So, hoping, hoping they make their way to, like, Jeremy, and they're very nicely printed  out and stuff.  And I think he has this whole image in his head that Jeremy will read it, Ken Stevens  will read it, and Spaz will be accepted as an idea man.  Spaz, you're lucky that the bosses didn't get a copy of this.  Yeah.  Spaz, I got to say, after reading this, I had to read through this twice. 
[01:43:30]  I swear to you.  Rick saw it in the office.  And it was dumbfounded.  I had to read through this twice to maybe see if there was a punchline to it or just  to grasp it in my head.  This could possibly be the most ridiculous, insane idea I've ever, ever read to be presented  on this program.  Do you truly think this is a good idea for the show?  I just need to know.  I know this is a lot of work involved. 
[01:44:00]  No, no, not work involved.  We don't care if we have to build a spaceship and fly to Venus for a good idea.  I mean, we'll try it.  Yeah, we'll go the distance for a good idea.  It has nothing to do with work involved.  Is this worth a lot of effort?  I believe so.  Okay.  You see nothing wrong with this?  So you handed this in and you were all excited, right?  It's right up your alley.  But you were all excited, right?  You're like, I can't wait for them to read it.  They're going to go for it.  This is perfect, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm trying to get inside your head.  And he thinks it's right up our alley. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Like, this is the kind of stuff we should be doing on this program.  All right.  Well, let me read a little bit of this.  And we'll stop as we move along here, okay?  Spaz's O&A show idea.  Porno casting call.  The concept, Anthony.  Yeah.  Do an open casting call for women who want to be in a porno of all women gotten from the  O.P. and Anthony show.  First of all, the grammar there is fantastic.  It's horrendous.  Do an open casting call for women who want to be in a porno of all women gotten from  the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:45:00]  Now, what you're trying to say here is we open up the phone lines and say, okay, girls,  call up now.  We are producing a porno movie.  So we want a porno movie featuring you, the girls that listen to O.P. and Anthony.  Yes.  Okay.  Only women would be allowed up into the studio.  No men would be allowed in because of the number of people expected.  So you're expecting a lot. 
[01:45:30]  Huge turnout.  If we said we are casting for a porno, you're just convinced that there's going to be just  hundreds of women showing up at the station, right?  Yes, because I believe that there are a lot of girls out there who want to do this but  just don't know how to go about doing it.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And why no men?  Well, because, you know, they would just be in the way and everything.  Plus, you always get upset whenever you see men when you have girls on a lesbian count.  True.  Okay.  That is a true thing right there.  Okay.  If the men are interested in getting into the film, send their lady to be evaluated, and 
[01:46:00]  if the woman makes the cut, I will speak with the men myself after the casting call.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  What the hell does that mean?  So you're going to be the porno director, right?  Actually, it's...  You want to take this idea on, so you would be the porno director.  Yeah.  All right, so you want to interview guys, girls.  Yes.  Girlfriends, right?  Yes.  So how do they get in the film if their lady's been evaluated and is going to make the cut?  Well, like, they, you know, walk-on scene or something like that.  But if they're interested in getting into this line of work, then we would talk them off 
[01:46:30]  because they wouldn't actually be naked in the studio.  Because we don't have men themselves.  Oh, my God.  So you will speak with the men myself after the casting call.  Now, see if they'll be part of the film.  What would you speak to them about?  I don't even get, like, okay, a guy says, hey, I want to be in the porno movie.  And then you say, well, let me see your hot girlfriend, right?  And then you evaluate the girlfriend.  Yes.  So then what are you going to say to the guy after the girl makes the cut?  Though we might be able to work you into a walk-on part, we'll take a look at, you 
[01:47:00]  know, your resume, I guess.  And then we'll get back to you.  Okay.  All right.  You know, we should give Craig from Belmore a prize today.  He remembered Spaz's last idea.  Oh, what was it?  Remember it?  The eight-man fight club between show regulars?  Oh, right.  That was it.  And then Craig goes, what a loser.  Craig, we know your email address.  Give us a phone number because we're going to give you a prize, okay? 
[01:47:30]  Because that's good.  I forgot all about that spaz idea.  I will speak with the men myself after the casting call.  The women will be expected to get naked, be evaluated, describe past sexual experiences,  answer questions of a sexual nature, and at the very end, all interested women that make  the cut will take part in a mass lesbian-for-a-day casting couch audition.  Are you working for the WWF or something? 
[01:48:00]  It's like some battle royale with lesbians.  Without getting into any details, women expecting to get naked and be evaluated, describe their  past sexual experiences, does that sound vaguely familiar of another program that airs in this  city?  Vaguely, sure.  In the morning?  Don't you realize, like, we try to do stuff that is a little different?  And even try harder than usual so as to avoid any comparison? 
[01:48:30]  Have you ever seen a program where maybe a girl gets up, takes her clothes off, and is  evaluated by the members of this other program?  And that's why I don't think we've ever used the word evaluate on this program?  But he's never had it on film?  No, not on film.  Not on two TV shows.  No, no.  Jesus H. Christ.  All right.  All right.  To guarantee there will definitely be some action that day.  Well, this is way...  Back up.  Yeah, this is...  This is when they're doing the Lesbian-for-a-day casting couch audition. 
[01:49:00]  Yes.  And, no, they will be taking part in a mass Lesbian-for-a-day casting couch audition.  How many lesbians are you going to get on the couch at one time?  I figure we can fit as many...  Thousands, Opie.  Well, on the couch, around the couch, you know...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Okay.  Woo!  And then, as Ann said, to guarantee that there will definitely be some action that day,  I will supply some ringers who will definitely perform. 
[01:49:30]  Spaz, where are you getting ringers?  I know of a source to get ringers.  Where's your source?  Anthony the limo driver, right?  No, not him.  Who?  It's a friend of mine.  What's your source?  A friend of mine who...  Johnny Action?  No, Johnny Action.  Who's your source?  The Invisible Man?  Earl's friend?  I have a source.  What's your friggin' source?  Don't you think we wouldn't ask you, if we actually considered this idea for a nanosecond,  we wouldn't ask you what your source is?  My source is a friend of mine who's done a film before. 
[01:50:00]  Your friend Gary.  Let's just put it out.  Gary, who did the porno movie...  With me in it for ten seconds.  And with you in it for ten seconds.  Yes.  Where you were what?  Just a...  I was a cop.  You were a cop.  That's right.  Spaz is like trying to be Larry Flint.  So he'll supply some ringers.  Spaz is casting for Caligula 2.  The film itself will be shot here in New York City.  Oh, good.  Oh, it's cursing!  I'm cursing.  I'm cursing. 
[01:50:30]  We won't have to fly off to an exotic location.  The film itself will be shot here in New York.  It would be done in the gonzo style, allowing for more free-form, free-wheeling, anything-goes style, you effing moron.  What the hell does that mean?  What does that mean?  What is gonzo style?  It'd be like anything goes.  What do you mean anything goes?  That's what happens in every porno.  It's just called porno.  It's not called gonzo porno.  It will be done in the gonzo.  I prefer making films in the gonzo style, O.P. 
[01:51:00]  You know, the Muppet Show gonzo style.  And who's your influence?  Oh, the gonzo style.  Are there people you respect in the porno business that you follow?  There are professionals, but the thing is, like, usually there are restrictions.  Like, it'd be like, we can use, like, tools.  Like, I don't know, they can, there are usually restrictions on a different porno. 
[01:51:30]  Okay, in this porno, we're not going to use toys.  Pornos are like that.  But this would be open.  Like, whatever the girl wants to do, she can do.  She can do it.  What if a girl wants to take a shovel and slam it on the back of the head of another lesbian?  Well, no violence, of course.  I'm talking about sexual, a lot of sexual, if they want to take one of the cars and stick it up there.  How about bloodletting?  If that's what they're into?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  But in the sexual nature, whatever's erotic to them.  What's wrong with you?  All right, so, all right, so you want to have an open casting call for, for, will it be called the Opie and Anthony porno? 
[01:52:00]  Will our names be associated with this, or will it be the spaz porno?  No, if you choose.  Do you have a name for this film?  Not yet, but you guys could be associated as much as you want to.  Great.  Well, we all strive to be porn directors and producers.  That's really our goal here.  But you kind of do it anyway.  It's not like we get in trouble for explaining too explicitly genitalia or anything.  We'll just film a porno and put it out there.  Yeah, we have like ten women that listen to us. 
[01:52:30]  We'll convince them to come in here for this mass lesbian for a day casting couch audition.  And then the girls are allowed to do whatever the hell they want to do.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure the phones are going to ring off the hook with ladies that want to do this.  Spaz is jerk diggler.  You never know.  Oh, my God.  Taylor, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I got a great idea for a contest.  Yeah, what?  Yeah, it's called the Beat the Crap Out of Spaz Contest.  I like it already.  Open the phone lines, and the first 102 callers get to kick the crap out of spaz. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Taylor.  Later, brother.  God damn, you get people so freaking pissed off.  Spaz, did you think this up on your two-and-a-half-hour train ride today?  Jason, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Yeah, I'm just wondering, is Spaz going to go for the retarded pizza boy delivery guy in there?  Very good, Jason.  Very good.  God.  All right, so we've got to move on.  This is just explaining the film. 
[01:53:30]  So you haven't really explained the Gonzo style.  Pretty much anything goes is your answer to that, right?  Yeah, pretty much everything goes.  All right, so the film itself would be shot here in New York City.  It would be done in the Gonzo style, allowing for a more free-form, free-wheeling, anything-goes style.  It will only star women gotten from the casting call.  Gotten from the casting call.  There will be multiple scenes shot with a variety of different things to highlight each scene.  Right?  Yes.  Okay, and you explained some of these different highlights of your porno film, right? 
[01:54:00]  Yes.  One of them being both Opie and Anthony are invited to come and direct the scene either together or separately.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  We come down and direct a scene.  Yes.  You lost your mind somewhere, right?  No, you can direct the scene.  Is there going to be a thrilling scene that I can direct where a boyfriend gropes his girlfriend before he goes on a two-hour commute?  That's a fun, that'd be a fun scene, huh?  Come on.  Are you insane?  We have a studio location where you guys can go unseen. 
[01:54:30]  Here's what happened.  All right?  Here's what happened.  Spaz and his porn friggin' wannabe director got together for a few too many beers, and Spaz decided that he's going to hook this guy up with a way to sell his porno.  He's going to use Opie and Anthony.  Crap.  And you're flattering us by saying we'll direct a scene, so of course if we direct a scene in a porno, you don't think we're going to be talking about it like crazy on the air? 
[01:55:00]  So Spaz is sitting there with his buddy going, okay, how can I get, oh, I'll entice Opie and Anthony to say yes, but I'll invite them to direct the scene.  They can't refuse that.  I'm appalled that you would even say that.  Are you, I'm appalled that you would come up with this.  I think it was right up your alley a great idea, and you know, at least I'm trying with ideas.  Guys, just because I have the Spaz moniker, it doesn't mean that every idea is stupid.  A lot of these ideas could be good if it's stupid.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[01:55:30]  Are you kidding?  This idea?  I'm telling you, it's golden.  Tommy, what's up?  Golden!  Now it's golden!  Tommy, what's up?  What is his definition of gonzo?  Gonzo, wait, I got it.  Gonzo style.  It would be done in the gonzo style, allowing for a more free-form, free-wheeling, anything-goes style.  Spaz, can you name me one porno that you know that is done in gonzo style?  I don't know.  I haven't spoken to the directors.  Because you don't know what gonzo is. 
[01:56:00]  Gonzo is amateur porn.  It has nothing to do with free-wheeling anything.  Buttman.  You guys heard of Buttman, right?  Yeah.  The Avengers of Buttman.  Yeah, of course.  Gonzo.  That's Gonzo.  Gonzo.  So Gonzo basically means amateur.  Correct.  Okay.  So I guess Spaz could probably do it, being that he is an amateur.  Seymour Butts?  Gonzo?  Amateur.  Gonzo, right?  Gonzo.  And the biggest...  Debbie Does Dallas?  What's that?  Debbie Does Dallas? 
[01:56:30]  No, not Gonzo.  Not Gonzo, okay.  Tracy Lord's films?  Not Gonzo.  Not Gonzo, okay.  Now that we have that straight...  Very good.  Like we said, he doesn't know what he's talking about.  Spaz is going to film it in Bozo style.  The Pam and Tommy Lee tape?  Gonzo.  Gonzo.  Okay, there you go.  Now we're understanding that at least.  Thank you, Tommy.  All right, you got it.  Thanks.  All right, let's go to Glenn real fast, then we've got to move on with the idea.  Just another proud day in Iona College history, right here, right now. 
[01:57:00]  Glenn, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm looking for somebody to back me in a new snuff spaz film.  Yeah, that's my proposal.  Yeah.  I want to do a snuff film.  Yeah.  Spaz, if you would help out.  Here's my proposal.  We do an open casting call to murderers that want to come down here and blow your effing  head off live on film.  But first they have butt sex with you.  And Opie and I can be invited in to direct the scene.  And, you know, I think I would go for that one. 
[01:57:30]  Fine.  So both Opie and Anthony are invited to come and direct the scene either together or separately.  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  Spazoid mind trick.  ONA will direct the scene.  He's trying to do a Jedi Minecraft on us.  Yeah.  You want to direct the scene.  All right.  These are not the porn stars you're looking for.  All right.  Check this out.  More about the film, Anthony, besides us directing.  Have one of the non-CBS contracted people associated with the show actually appear and perform 
[01:58:00]  in a scene.  Example, Old Dirty.  He's dragging Old Dirty into the porno.  If he wants to be in it.  Was Old Dirty in the meeting with you and your porn wannabe guy?  Old Dirty, get me in there.  Old Dirty, I'll hook you up so you'll be able to get laid.  My buddy, what's his name?  Gary.  My buddy, Gary.  Don't worry.  I'll get over you, Anthony.  And CBS will finance the whole thing.  CBS will finance porno.  It's great. 
[01:58:30]  See, we're involved with Viacom now, so I'm going to get him in all the blockbuster videos.  Military Mike has a good point here.  Military Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on at ONA?  How are you?  Hey, Spaz, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  If I remember correctly, the lawyers wouldn't let these two guys put out a CD.  Yeah.  And they're going to let them put out a porno.  Thank you, Mike.  We can't put out a CD because it has some questionable material on it.  How the hell are we going to get a porno out there, you idiot?  You don't have to be in the credits.  You just direct the one scene.  Have a good one, guys.  Thank you, Mike. 
[01:59:00]  You don't have to be in the credits.  Spaz, this is a way you're going to get your friend Gary to sell a porno that he wants to make.  That never even entered our minds.  Oh, bull, come on.  Come on.  I'm appalled by that statement.  I think I'm taking it back.  I'm appalled at this proposal.  I'm taking it back.  Taking it back.  Mike, what's up?  ONA.  Yeah.  Favor for it.  Who's closer to him right now?  Anthony.  Anthony.  Kick him as hard as you can in the nuts.  There's no chance of him ever breeding again. 
[01:59:30]  No chance.  No chance at all.  What a frickin' dope.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  There's more.  There's more to the concept.  We're talking about Spaz's idea.  He wants to have a porno casting call, and he wants basically an open Anthony porno, but  he's not saying that.  But Spaz would be the director.  Okay, more about the film.  Have some of the sexual positions discussed on the show performed in the film.  Example, the rusty trombone, the wheelbarrow. 
[02:00:00]  So the girls that come in for the open casting call will be doing the rusty trombone on the  likes of Old Dirty.  Not in the studio, but in the disclosed location.  At what undisclosed location, not disclosed location?  Undisclosed, I'm sorry.  At what?  At the guy who's filming it.  Oh, at Gary's studio.  Well, it's not his studio.  It's someone else's studio.  Someone else who?  You don't know him.  But you do.  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  And was he at this meeting, too?  Has he been contacted?  Have all the principals that you mention in this, aside from, you know, porn star, Old Dirty,  been contacted?  Aside from Old Dirty, yes.  So you've already...  Just in case it was a go.  Just in case it was a go.  I am...  Just when you think he can't do it.  Just when you think there's the giant mosquito or the cancerous live wires.  Just when you think he cannot...  That's stupider.  ...come up with something that will just mesmerize you. 
[02:01:00]  Michelle says she's interested.  Michelle, are you interested in the spaz porno?  Yeah, I am.  Can I...  Does spaz hear me?  Yeah.  I had a fib a little to get on the air, but I was just wondering if he liked his girlfriend  a little bit and even cared, even cared what she thought about his ideas.  Yeah.  Have you run this past Erica?  She heard me and Gary talking it over.  And what did she think about the wonderful porn?  God, if Erica's listening, please give us a call. 
[02:01:30]  Give me her number.  Erica would never agree, and I'll stay on the line and know Erica would kill him for it.  All right.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you.  Now, one lady's calling saying that she wants to be in this spaz porno.  This just in from the...  Unbelievable.  The invisible man checking in from the Staten Island Furry, Earl.  My name is Spaz Cush Cush.  Right.  Earl and I want to direct a scene, too.  Oh, the invisible man wants it?  Yeah.  Can we have the invisible man?  We'll just have some chick, like...  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:00]  Dude.  Okay.  Spaz is writing something.  Why don't you say no?  Okay.  What?  What?  Not a good time to call Erica.  Why?  Personal problems.  Personal problems.  What?  You have another personal problem, Erica?  No, no, no.  It has nothing to do with me.  No, it has to do with Erica's family.  Okay.  All right.  Personal family problems.  Sure.  All right.  We'll get her on another time.  But I'm sure she would just be thrilled that you want to go through with this idea.  Well, she actually didn't say anything. 
[02:02:30]  Because she was storming out in disgust, probably.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, there's more to the porno casting call, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Spaz does Slotspur.  But not from Jersey, who comes up with funny stuff every day.  The name of the Spaz porno should be called Spaz does Slotspur.  Very good.  Okay.  Now the porno names are going to start coming in.  Unbelievable.  All right.  The bonus of doing the... 
[02:03:00]  Are we calling it officially the Opie and Anthony porno or the Spaz porno?  Whatever you want to call it.  Backed by Opie and Anthony.  What would it be called?  You must have knocked around some names with Gary and whatever the other porn guys you were with.  Basically, we would leave it totally up to you what you want to call it and how much you want to get involved with it.  So, basically, we would do all the work and you would get the credit, right?  No.  No.  Everybody would get credit for their porn.  We would promote the hell out of this, Opie.  No.  So as to, you know, get our name in the porno industry. 
[02:03:30]  That's exactly...  It's not hard enough showing up at the goddamn Thanksgiving dinners with my family for what we're doing here on the air as we speak.  Yeah.  But, you know, if I could just add porn director and porn producer and porn promoter onto my resume, my life would be happy.  That's one thing I really want to get into.  Pornography.  You don't have to promote it.  You just direct the one scene.  This whole thing is promoting a porno.  For one day.  For one day, I ask. 
[02:04:00]  One day, one day.  This is all going to happen in one day.  Filming everything.  One day.  We can't get through a spaz as we can review in one day.  Spaz, I beg you to do a porno.  We'll have nothing to do with it, but I beg you to do it because I need a good laugh.  It'll be the funniest thing I ever see in my life.  We want the director's cut, too.  Who the hell are you hanging out with?  Who are your friends?  Are you on the pipe?  You're hanging out with moronic extreme wrestlers that pound each other's brains in with two-by-fours and wannabe porn guys. 
[02:04:30]  He was in a film.  How could it be a wannabe if he was already in a film that's been released, by the way, and selling copies?  Selling copies.  Speaking of that, what would happen with this porno?  Where would it end up?  It would end up in the porno stores and selling.  Uncle John wants to say something real fast.  Uncle John.  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  Great.  Hey, I want to volunteer to buy drugs and plant them in Spaz's house.  Then we can, like, have a lottery to call the cops and see who gets them busted. 
[02:05:00]  What do you think?  I like the idea, man.  All right, cool.  Rock on, guys.  Talk to you later.  I hope he's cursing.  What I want to say is give John some credit.  He comes up with good Fs every day.  Un-effing believable.  Will there be a scene where a giant mosquito comes in and starts railing this woman with the proboscis?  If you want that in the film, we can have somebody get it.  Wouldn't that be funny?  A big, giant mosquito comes in with a nose like a dildo? 
[02:05:30]  That would have to be some of that wacky cartoon porn.  Yeah, yeah.  And just starts going at it.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Alan from Englewood, New Jersey.  Holy F.  Earl may have an invisible friend, but I think that Spaz has an F in invisible brain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Spaz admitted it.  You used to write for the Mason Kalinsky show, right?  The anti-brain show. 
[02:06:00]  All right, listen.  All right, so let's, all right, now he has bonuses, Anthony, to this whole Spaz, Opie, Anthony, porno, whatever he's going to do.  Now he's going to spell out the upside to this whole thing.  Okay.  This is the big pitch.  This is where he, you know, was going to get us with his pitch.  Here it is.  Just for allowing the casting call to take place, I will supply you with two dozen videos to be given to the audience.  So wait, we're going to get two dozen of the finished product to give out as prizes.  Yeah, because you did the Opie's porno, you did that as a giveaway, so I figured if you could do that, then you could do this as a giveaway. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  And if we are allowed to shoot the casting call and include scenes in the movie, I will try to get at least a gross of films to be supplied to the show.  Oh, you're going to try to get a gross.  And how many is in a gross?  I don't know.  I really don't.  It sounded good.  Also.  He doesn't even know what a gross is, but he's going to try to get us one.  No, but a gross is like the full amount of films.  A gross is that you have a brain in your head that you ain't using, and a poor retard is walking around drooling on himself. 
[02:07:00]  Also, a live event can be planned to coincide with the release of the film.  Good, good.  And we can have all the players involved appear.  Yeah.  Well, it's like a release party.  Yeah, release.  Any questions, contact me, 917-422-6189.  We can have porno sticker stops. 
[02:07:30]  We'll put the WOW stickers at porno locations.  Now, Spaz, are you getting beeped there, Spaz?  You getting beeped?  No.  My page goes on and off from time to time.  All right, so do you have a basic idea for this porno?  You get all the girls involved, our listeners.  Yes.  It'd be basically a lot of girl-on-girl scenes.  A lot of girl-on-girl scenes, right?  Spaz, Jeremy. 
[02:08:00]  We filmed just one scene here of the lesbian couch of all the girls involved.  Well, if we can't film it here, then we just film everything in the undisclosed location.  We could just have the casting call here.  Is the undisclosed location your apartment?  No.  Where is the undisclosed location?  Right here in Manhattan.  It's in Manhattan.  We need to know, because I'm convinced there's a girl tied up there right now.  Just waiting for R-O-K.  Right.  No.  All right, Spaz.  Now you've got 60 seconds to give us the final pitch. 
[02:08:30]  The final pitch.  What else can you add before we give you our answer?  Okay.  I think it's right up your alley.  You guys are going to talk about porno a lot.  You guys have the lesbian couch.  I figure you're spicing it up by having more than one or two girls on the couch at the same time.  They'll be doing everything, but you probably can't describe it on the air.  But for your amusement, if off the air or on the air, just stick your tunnies anywhere they want.  And I just think it'd be good and it'd be something, a little spin-off, a little different from just doing the ordinary lesbian on the couch.  Would it be more good? 
[02:09:00]  More good.  Okay.  More good.  It'd be like a spin-off of what you're really doing, you know, just to take it to the next level.  Like the Joni Loves Chats, you have porno?  Yeah, a spin-off, Opie.  A little cute spin-off show.  Spaz.  Next time you get together with your porno friends, your friends in the pornography industry, please don't bring up our names.  Don't bring up the fact that you're going to be like, you're going to try to be the big guy, that you're going to promote them. 
[02:09:30]  Spaz is going to be the big guy.  He's going to be the big shot.  And go into his porno friends and say, guys, I got a way where we can make a porno, we're going to advertise it on the Opie and Anthony show, and we're all going to get rich, and I'm going to pay off my $47,000 debt with pornography with the help of Opie and Anthony.  Because that's it.  Spaz, that's what you were doing.  Why else are you going to sit there?  Then why not just get together with your friends and make a porno and not let us even know about it, never mind trying to drag our names into it? 
[02:10:00]  Because I thought that I could bring a show idea to you.  You think we want to endorse porno?  A porn movie?  You did the Opie thing?  No.  That's not endorsing anything.  You did a porno that came out called Opie Does South Central.  South Central.  Something like that.  All of a sudden.  It was a stupid quick little idea.  Let's give out some of them to people of age.  That's all.  Yeah, and they had to come down here live and in person, produce ID showing that they were 21, and then we gave them the tape. 
[02:10:30]  But you have Liz being on the couch.  So?  So what's the difference if we just...  Spaz, not one girl is called.  That one girl was interested.  Not one girl is called.  She wasn't interested.  She wanted to abuse you.  I just figured, just have more than one or two girls on the couch as usual.  Laura, what's going on?  I just want to know if Spaz really thinks that even if us girls would want to do a porno, would we really do a porno with his name on it? 
[02:11:00]  I mean, after everything that...  I mean, I don't mean to, like, you know, diss him or anything, but, I mean, he talks about giant mosquitoes and things like that.  I really wouldn't want to be in a porno that has to do with his name.  That's not good publicity, you know?  That's why he was trying to get us involved.  I mean, yeah, if anything, yeah, exactly.  The publicity, that's why he wants to do it on the show.  Believe it or not, Ant and I still have our good names.  Barely, but we do.  Yeah, I think you guys are doing really good.  This would be a bad idea for you guys to get into, I think. 
[02:11:30]  All right, Laura, thank you.  That's what we would love to do.  And, boy, the company would just...  Yeah, again...  Hey, guys, could I get my name on that porno?  That sounds great.  Now you boys are talking.  That's Spaz is a smart businessman.  Right.  I want you, O.P. and Anthony, to help out the company by doing a porno.  Do you honestly think that would fly?  You honestly...  You printed this out.  Do you want to go to Ken Stevens, maybe?  No, no, not with that. 
[02:12:00]  No, why?  Why?  It's a great idea for the show.  Why wouldn't you present this to the big boss here, the general manager, the one that you  want to bond with and get closer with, Ken Stevens, and show him what a great idea you  have so he can embrace you as an employee of this company.  I'm going to put my copy in his mailbox.  No, come on.  It's coming back tomorrow.  I want to send one to Mel.  What?  Can we do that?  We'll just throw one off in that direction.  It'll end up at BlackRock, and he could read through this.  Sure.  Okay.  Hey, maybe Ken could come in and direct the scene. 
[02:12:30]  Maybe Ken Stevens would want to come down and direct his own scene.  I'm trying.  Chris from Staten Island writes, Spaz can make a Golden Showers video.  Girls getting leaked on from the roof of the WNW building.  Oh, my God.  So, if you think it's such a good idea, why wouldn't you want us to give this to Ken Stevens?  Because you never give any of the other show ideas to Ken Stevens before we do it. 
[02:13:00]  Usually give it to him after we do it.  He actually has a good point there.  No.  You know why?  That's us.  Spaz, did you fall off the train this morning?  No.  Since you're rolling behind the train.  Spaz, you have to, without naming the station or anything else, you've got to tell Anthony  the other show idea you had in the office last week.  Oh, my God.  What other one?  About the power grid.  Oh, come on. 
[02:13:30]  That's a good idea, too.  You were serious about this.  Where's Ben?  You were honestly serious about this.  Get Ben and Rick on the mic.  Dead serious.  All right, listen, don't name the stations, don't name what power company that you have  friends at.  Gee, yeah.  But explain.  There's so many of them.  Explain your other show idea.  I met somebody at the wrestling who works for a power company, and he said that he could  shut off the grid that a certain other station belongs to, and just during, I guess, whatever 
[02:14:00]  time of day we choose.  Oh!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Do you know how many years in jail you would get if you pulled off that idea?  In jail.  Not just fired.  Not fired.  From this company, which I think now, do we own Baskin Robbins now, too?  You wouldn't even be able to sling ice cream at this point?  You wouldn't even be able to work at Blockbuster after you got out of doing 10 years. 
[02:14:30]  Wait, let me, let me, let me say it again.  Spaz came to us last week and had an idea of turning off a power grid.  Power grid.  Here in the city.  To get rid of our competition for a day.  Or you could shut down just the building itself.  Brilliant idea.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Or die in an elevator.  Dude, you would be arrested so freaking fast.  But I would have nothing to do with, though, because I'm not the one pulling the switch.  Oh, when they come to Ant and I, very suspicious, you think we're not going to, you know, tell 
[02:15:00]  you what you have to drive.  You'd have nothing to do with throwing the switch, but the guy that approached you, if  you said yes, he would do it?  But you had nothing, there's nothing like a conspiracy?  Do you know what the word conspiracy means, to conspire?  I said, I said you could do it, but I don't want to, I don't want to know anything about  it.  We'd all be thrown in jail.  Thrown in jail, fired, and just.  Do you remember a few years back, well, you probably don't, because for some reason, 
[02:15:30]  I don't know how you even got into the radio industry, because you probably haven't heard  any lessons.  There was a woman that cut a power line to a remote broadcast.  We're not talking knocking out an entire portion of a major city, of the biggest city  in the world.  We're not talking about that.  She cut the power line of a very popular radio host during his show.  So only his show got knocked off the air.  They brought her up on charges.  That she had to get a lawyer and fight criminal charges. 
[02:16:00]  And she was just fired.  Fired.  She did the actual cutting.  Right?  So she, that's why.  No, I actually, whatever.  No, she didn't.  No, she didn't.  It was her idea.  But it wasn't my idea.  It was his idea.  I said, you could do it, but I don't want anything about it.  You can't even tell him you could do it.  Don't tell anyone to do crap like that for our radio show.  I, I, I don't want to know anything about it.  You are quickly becoming a liability.  You've got to be smart enough to say, dude, you're insane.  Don't do that. 
[02:16:30]  I thought it would be funny.  You thought it was a great idea?  Oh, my God.  All right, Ann, it gets better.  Spaz's girlfriend, Erica, is on the line.  Oh, good.  We definitely, good.  Thank God.  We definitely have to take a very quick break.  I promise it'll be quick.  We'll come back and we'll talk to Spaz's girlfriend, Erica.  What?  You don't think it's her?  Erica.  Erica.  Yeah.  Can you hold on a minute?  Yeah, sure.  We have to take a quick break.  Okay.  Great.  It's you, right, Spaz?  Yeah.  All right.  It's me. 
[02:17:00]  Why are you calling?  I don't know how he's going to do it.  It's his whining, Spaz thing.  Because didn't Opie, Opie wanted me to call.  We absolutely wanted you to call.  We need your input on this whole situation.  Give us a quick break and you can talk about Spaz and his porno idea, okay?  Okay.  All right, hold on.  Okay.  Make sure, we'll call her back because I'm sure they don't have many minutes left on their  cell phone.  I finally found out where the undisclosed location is.  Where?  It's the St. Regis Hotel.  We have to do a room out for $750 a night.  So the budget on this movie is very high. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  Part two of the Spaz porno idea on the way.  Stay there.  It's the St. Regis Hotel, Spaz, and Nick, with Andy, make me nauseous.  Whoa!  Don't know why we keep him with the trouble.  That's because.  Whoa!  Man's a bomb with brain damage and thoughts like this on pause.  Whoa!  Super St. Regis Hotel, Spaz, and Nick, with Andy, make me nauseous.  Whoa!  I call him Kevin K.  Goat Spaz when he thinks of the phone.  Whoa!  Don't expect an answer because his brain cells are all blown.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hey, this is Louisa Veruca Salt. 
[02:18:00]  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  I want my underwear back, you pricks! 
[02:18:30]  Ah, yes.  Car Cash.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  That's 1-800-CAR-CASH.  Bunch of people emailing me, excuse me, saying, what's the company that makes it real easy  to sell your car?  What's the phone number?  Even the phone number is easy.  Very easy.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  That's right, Ed.  It's very easy to do.  They buy any kind of car, new cars, fancy cars, vans, pickups, 4x4s, even leased or  financed cars.  If you could drive it, Car Cash will buy it.  No one gives you more money for your car than Car Cash, and no one makes selling it easier. 
[02:19:00]  You know what the deal is with the newspaper.  It takes forever.  You've got to give your number out to people that are like Spaz.  You know, you want to sell your car, all of a sudden your number's out there in the  paper.  Spaz is calling you asking if you want to star in a porno movie or something.  When all you wanted to do was sell your car fast and easy.  The paper's no way to do it.  Call 1-800-CAR-CASH.  Fast and easy.  You'll be out of there.  One guy, what is this?  He walked in 20 minutes later, walked out with more money than I thought he'd have for 
[02:19:30]  his car.  So even if you're thinking about selling your car, give it a shot.  See what they'll give you.  I'm sure you'll be happy.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  Visit Car Cash on the web at www.carcash.com or stop by Car Cash on West 55th Street between  11th and 12th Avenues.  See, they're not in an undisclosed location, I think.  Right in Manhattan.  Or just give them a call at 1-800-CAR-CASH.  That's 1-800-CAR-CASH.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Other debauchery on the way. 
[02:20:00]  Stay there.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  All right, it's the O&A Show.  Earl handing out WOW stickers at the Staten Island Furry today.  Yeah.  Manhattan side.  I think he's leaving soon.  Let's check in with him real fast here.  Earl, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  We're in front of the South Ferry Southwest Station on the uptown side.  We're handing out WOW stickers, and a couple people are joining us out here.  We're having fun.  Very good.  How long are you going to be there for?  That's the wrap.  We'll be here for another 10, 15 minutes or so. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  It's a possible van.  All right.  So get close to that location.  Get your WOW sticker, all right?  Thank you, right?  We're right under the underpass.  Right on, man.  Thanks.  All righty.  Bye.  There you go.  Bye.  Guys, I got a great idea for the show.  We take the WOW van and load it with fertilizer and fuel oil and hydrogen and drive it under the  World Trade Center and detonate it.  I was sitting with my friends, Rabib and Rashad.  No, but it's time I had to.  Like, I wouldn't be driving the van, so it's okay. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  You know, what you were proposing with the electric power is indeed terrorism.  It's terrorism.  Look, he's all pissed off.  Gary, who's the lawyers on the line.  Gary, what's up?  Yeah, I'm on the west side of the highway.  I said, crap out.  I'm sorry.  All right.  I don't mean to alert anyone, but Anthony really put his finger on it before.  Not only are you putting your own show in jeopardy, you could be putting your entire  station's license on the line.  Of course.  License.  Do you know something? 
[02:21:30]  How about, figure this little scenario out.  You cut the power grid, right?  Yeah.  Somebody, because of the loss of power, dies.  Maybe a few people.  It's a big city.  Maybe, maybe a respirator fails in a hospital.  Maybe somebody in the dark falls down and breaks their neck.  Do you know you'd be liable for those deaths?  We can only shut down the one building then.  Oh, my God.  Okay, so somebody sits and falls down a flight of stairs and breaks their neck. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  Is that only one death?  Someone gets caught in the elevator, freaks out, and frigging dies of a heart attack.  Do you know something?  You could be sued.  I mean, were you thinking?  Spaz, were these people talking about the civil?  He's talking about criminal activity.  Yeah.  He would be put away forever.  For your life, Spaz.  The next time someone comes to you with a really stupid idea, just don't say anything.  Okay.  Let this sort of be funny.  Just say you've got to talk to the guys about it.  Don't make any decisions for the show. 
[02:22:30]  You're going to get us all screwed.  I always wonder when you see on the news that somebody did something really stupid  and someone ends up dead or crippled and stuff, and you go,  who the hell is that frigging stupid?  Well, you wouldn't play it.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you, Gary the lawyer, everyone.  Stupid!  Have a good time.  So, so stupid!  All right, so let's get back to your porno idea.  The Spaz porno or the Opie and Anthony porno or whatever you call it.  Spaz porno, but we help them with it, with our listeners,  but only women on a lesbian couch. 
[02:23:00]  I have a great idea for the show, guys.  What?  Well, next time Clinton's in town, I could...  No, no, no, don't even say it.  Dude, don't...  Secret Service will be here so freaking fast.  Don't say what you want to say.  Be like, well, it won't be me.  She's okay.  No, no, no.  Don't even...  It's okay.  No, no, no.  Unbelievable.  Just in case anyone's wondering,  Spaz does not make any decisions for our show. 
[02:23:30]  No.  No.  Because I don't want to go home worrying about the crap you're saying to people when we're not around.  Do you think Corky, during the filming of Life Goes On,  was going up to the producers, directors of the show, and giving his ideas?  No.  He's just Corky.  He's the retard from Life Goes On.  Right.  They turn on the camera, he gives the toothy little crooked grin, and life goes on.  That's it.  All right.  So let's talk to Spaz's lovely girlfriend, Erica, who is hot, by the way. 
[02:24:00]  And I'm just saying it because a lot of listeners want to know.  The lovely Erica.  They're like, is she really hot, or are you guys just, you know, being nice to her?  No, she's nice.  Nice woman, nice looking, okay?  Don't mean anything by it, Spaz.  Don't get mad.  Come on.  All right, we want to see what Erica thinks of your porno idea.  Is it true that you were just on the phone with her, yelling at her?  I was not yelling.  For calling in?  Erica?  Yes.  Hi.  Was Spaz reprimanding you for calling in? 
[02:24:30]  A little bit, yes.  A little bit, yes.  You know we wanted to talk to her, Spaz.  Why would you get on the phone and give her a hard time?  Because I got criticized for not protecting her and dragging her through the air,  and now when I do decide to...  No, Kevin, that was in the beginning,  when I was being called, like, a slut and a whore, okay?  Right.  Now this is, like, innocent little what I think about your porno idea.  All right, and what do you think?  I am just shocked.  I am stunned that he thinks it would be okay with me to just check out naked chicks, 
[02:25:00]  and what was it, evaluate them?  Well...  Evaluate them?  I wouldn't be doing the evaluating.  Oh, that's not what I heard these days.  No, no, no, Spaz, let me read from your one sheet here.  The women will be expected to get naked, be evaluated, describe past sexual experience,  answer questions of a sexual nature,  and at the very end, all interested women that make the cut  will take part in a mass lesbian for a day casting couch audition. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, but Gary would be included, too.  Gary?  Well, I don't really care if Gary's looking at me.  What's this Gary guy like?  He's really nice.  Is he?  Yeah.  Wow, that's interesting.  All right, now...  Mr. Porno.  And Spaz, Mr. Porno will supply some ringers, too.  Erica?  Yeah.  Spaz is going to supply some ringers.  That'll get the action hot and heavy.  What I'm confused about is he's very, very protective of me. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  Doesn't let me do a lot of things and checks up on me constantly.  I don't understand what makes him think that that would have been like,  okay, cool with me.  And you don't check up on me?  I'm not saying that, Kevin, because you freaking cheated on me.  What do you want me to do?  I love you to death, but you're driving me crazy.  Like, with this crap, like...  And, of course, because we have new listeners to this show,  the only reason Erica found out that Spaz cheated on her 
[02:26:30]  was because he wrote it on his calendar.  The calendar they share in their apartment.  The only reason why the whole world knows is because Erica decided to announce it.  Oh, no!  Now he's getting down on you.  She was hurting.  Spaz, you cheated on a girl and wrote it on your calendar.  Yeah, but still, you don't announce it to a million people.  No, you just write it on your calendar.  You might as well just have some Skywriter write it outside your apartment. 
[02:27:00]  That could be arranged.  I don't understand why it's like, you're turning on me, Kevin.  It's not me.  Yeah, don't get on Erica about this.  I'm just trying to ask Erica nicely what she thinks of Spaz's porno idea.  If there's one ass you should just be making out with, it's Erica's.  I'm amazed she sticks by you.  I'm not making out with any other ass.  I don't mean it in that way.  I mean it as you should kiss her ass.  I mean, you shouldn't be blaming her for any messes you get yourself into. 
[02:27:30]  For the love of God, the girl is...  I'm amazed at her power.  Erica, do you do heroin?  No.  Okay.  I'm trying to figure out how the hell you do it.  I don't really know.  Honestly, I don't know.  The poor girl is like, stands by you for everything.  Rick's puking over there and slap it a lot.  And the first chance you get, you're trying to blame her or turn it on to her?  I'm not blaming her for anything. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Justin wants to ask Erica, does Spaz come up with great ideas at home?  Oh, yeah.  Tons of them.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They just never see the light of day.  Like what?  Any of you can tell us?  No, not really.  No?  Okay.  I'd be curious, though, if he evaluates me.  Do you evaluate me, Kevin?  What do you mean?  When I'm standing there naked, do you evaluate me in your head?  When you maul her in the morning?  Did he maul you this morning?  This morning, this morning.  A little bit. 
[02:28:30]  A little mauling.  What does he do?  Like reach under the sheets and cop a feel?  What does he do?  Yeah.  Is that what you do?  I'm just going to feel you up, baby.  All right.  So, can I ask you about a scale you guys bought for your apartment?  I heard about the scale.  Erica?  Yeah?  Is it true that Spaz bought a really expensive scale for your apartment? 
[02:29:00]  Well, yeah.  He bought a scale instead of buying other stuff that we needed.  What kind of scale did you buy?  It was a $40 scale.  Why do you need a $40 scale?  It was the cheapest one there.  Why do you need a scale at all?  Where did you buy a scale?  A drugstore?  Bed, Bath & Beyond.  Bed, Bath & Beyond.  You can go...  Jesus Christ.  Do you know, Spaz, you can go to, like, Kmart and pick up a scale for about $5.  It might not be as accurate, but unless you're weighing cocaine to sell to the homies, I don't think you need something plus or minus, you know, a gram. 
[02:29:30]  It's a scale.  $40.  Maybe you ought to cut some corners, you know, and try to save a little cash.  Unless, of course, you think that the boat is going to be coming in with $47,000 on this porno project.  Porno!  Erica, he wants to go into porno.  I know, I know.  He's got a great opportunity here. 
[02:30:00]  He's in at the ground floor at a radio station that's just starting to make a name, working on a show that is pretty hot in this city, and he wants to go into porno.  Wait, you guys are missing something that's really, really funny.  It just shows how far Spaz lives from New York City.  Does anyone else hear the nature sounds on the phone?  I'm hearing, like, bald eagles and, like, this is opening, like, hyena. 
[02:30:30]  It's like the Serengeti.  Yeah, be quiet for a second.  All right, let's hear it.  Oh, now it stops.  Wait.  There it is.  There's, like, nature sounds.  That's how far he lives from the city.  Sorry.  Continue.  He's honestly, though, in his defense, I guess he just wanted to come up with a good idea.  Well, we...  Really? 
[02:31:00]  We encourage Spaz to continue bringing the ideas to us, yes.  And as he sits there and looking like he's going to cry...  I'm not going to cry.  Spaz, you should realize that you are bringing some great stuff to our radio show.  Thank you.  Are you mad at me, Kevin? 
[02:31:30]  Is he mad at me?  Is he mad at you?  Are you mad at her?  Let's just continue on.  Who are you mad at her for?  I never said so.  You're not saying no.  I'm not saying no, and I'm not saying yes.  You're not going to, like, after we're done with this phone call, run out of the room and call her and yell at her.  If you're mad at her, say it right now.  No.  Why?  Because there are personal...  Can I keep anything sacred or personal?  She hasn't said anything to bury you.  Can we just keep it as sacred and personal? 
[02:32:00]  There's no sacred or personal thing as far as you being mad at her.  If you're mad at her, I don't think you should be mad at her.  I'm not.  I never said I was.  She asked you, are you mad at me?  And you said, let's just go on.  No, let's just move on.  That's a chick answer, by the way.  That's not pertinent to...  That's a blatant chick answer.  That's spaz cat.  If those two pertains are what we're talking about, I don't want you to come home and be mad at me.  No, what we're talking about is your reaction to my idea.  That's all we want to hear. 
[02:32:30]  Okay, Kevin, I'm sorry.  What the hell is that?  Oh, somebody driving by.  Oh.  Driving by where?  Where I'm standing.  The animal preserve.  You don't even need to do the sound effects.  You can hear them in the background.  There's some kind of bird or something, some kind of eagle flying.  Karen on line nine has spaz's next idea, Anthony. 
[02:33:00]  Spaz's next idea, according to Karen on line nine, a controlled brush fire by Los Alamos.  Yeah, you weren't working for another station in Los Alamos, were you?  No.  All right, anything else, Erica?  So you're not happy with Spaz's porno idea that he brought to the table today?  No, I'm not.  Yeah, no one around here seems to be. 
[02:33:30]  The new Ron Jeremy.  I'm just not looking forward to later on.  Why?  Does he come home and, like, get verbally abusive with you?  I don't know.  That might be qualified as personal information.  Oh.  Spaz, what are you doing?  Spaz is the guy that, like, takes the brunt of the crap at work and then goes home.  We need my dinner.  I'll hit you in a yule lock.  Come on. 
[02:34:00]  Spaz, your lovely girlfriend has done nothing wrong here.  Just mellow out.  She should be upset.  It's a crazy idea.  I don't think my girlfriend would be thrilled if I told her, hey, we're going to make a porno.  And I'm going to direct it.  Yeah.  And I'm going to evaluate the girls beforehand.  I'm going to try to use the show I'm on to promote it.  Because that's what you're doing.  That's not it.  Oh, come on, Spaz.  I just thought I'd present a nice idea for you guys to participate in.  If you don't like it, then that's cool. 
[02:34:30]  Spaz, here we go.  Spaz.  We read through this already.  Give me one friggin' upside to doing this on this program.  One upside.  One.  Go ahead.  You get to see porn chicks.  So who comes to see chicks every day?  We see chicks every day.  We see girls in here.  It's a different spinoff.  They're usually like what we saw with the strippers the other day.  It's a different spinoff of how to do it.  A different spinoff.  What's the upside for this program?  Now, even though it wouldn't be an upside on a personal level for us to see this, which 
[02:35:00]  you seem to think it would be, I mean, for a show, for this program to progress from  the point it is now of working its way up, doing very well, how does this help the show?  Because, okay, today what do we got for the show?  Let's be on the couch.  Ho-hum again.  But this time it's a different...  When was the last time we did that?  We haven't done it in a while.  We haven't done that in a while because we do things, we rotate stuff.  But it's a repetition of, okay, we got two girls, two lesbian on the couch.  And then we elaborate on it by doing what we did.  We drip the candles on them. 
[02:35:30]  It's acceptable.  It's good for the spaz cam.  It works as far as nobody getting communicable diseases.  I mean, there's...  This does not help this program.  You know who this helps?  You're porno buddies, and it helps you, maybe.  Maybe.  It doesn't help me at all.  I don't benefit at all from this.  All right.  And you get two dozen videos to give to your audience.  But I don't...  And maybe a gross.  I got to see how much that is. 
[02:36:00]  But the company controls that, not me.  And is there any kind of a partnership?  What did they offer you?  What did they honestly offer you?  I see you friggin' smiling, so I know they said something.  What did they offer spaz personally to approach us with this idea?  I get one thing.  I get the...  Well, I presented the idea.  And what do you get in return?  That I get the recognition.  You get no cut of videos made?  I get the recognition. 
[02:36:30]  The recognition?  Of the idea.  Recognition.  You get the...  But your friends that are going to produce this video, package it, and market it, offer  you not dime one.  No, because it belongs to a production company that owns the rights of the film.  So how much is your buddy getting?  I don't know how much he gets, because he's the one that's going to be doing all the producing  for it.  It's with a production company.  No one said spaz.  Look, you'll get like 2% of the gross. 
[02:37:00]  They don't control that.  The company does.  I haven't been in contact with the company, so I don't know.  But they said it's possible.  But they said it's possible.  This is just ponderous.  F-ing ponderous.  Jim, on line three, I used to think this stuff was scripted.  No, this isn't scripted.  No, I swear to you.  This stuff is in his head every single day.  It's a new...  Joni, it's Crouchy.  Now, make nice with your girlfriend.  We are nice.  Spaz, we are going to get a full report from Erica.  No, you're not. 
[02:37:30]  Tomorrow.  Oh, yes, we will.  Yes, we are.  As far as the goings on.  Did you ever see The Godfather?  No.  You watch it tonight.  Do you ever see the point where Carlos is beating up Sonny's sister?  He, like, beats her up.  And do you see what Sonny does to him?  Sonny finds him on the street and proceeds to beat the living crap out of him.  We are going to check back with her and make sure nothing happens to Erica tonight. 
[02:38:00]  We don't need anything.  Make sure she doesn't tell you you don't take out your aggressions on her.  We don't need to get personal with you.  We're just going to make sure that, you know.  I never lay a hand on any girl.  We're not talking about laying a hand on anybody.  She shouldn't have to take your verbal abuse for her calling in and discussing her feelings about this whole thing.  I don't curse.  It doesn't matter.  But you just yell a lot, right?  I raise my voice.  I've been doing that since I was two. 
[02:38:30]  I have a habit of raising my voice.  It doesn't matter if I'm in a happy mood or not.  When the brain stopped growing.  I can't believe this.  Did Spaz see the movie Saturday with Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez called Rated X about porn?  Did you see that movie?  No, I don't.  Have you heard about it?  No?  Okay.  The brothers that make porno.  The brothers that make porno.  The brothers that make porno and all that.  Or one did end up killing the other.  Yeah, they make porno.  All right.  Well, Erica, thanks for being brave enough to call our show today.  You're welcome.  Erica, coming forward.  Spaz, any last words for Erica here? 
[02:39:00]  Wait till I get home, baby.  No.  It's not her fault.  We told her to call.  Your ass is going to match your hair.  Yes or no.  It's her decision, ultimately.  Kevin, there's going to be a problem when you get home.  I just don't want to be there because I really can't deal with that anymore.  Would you stop dragging it on?  There's going to be no problem, okay?  Do we need to make another 20-minute bit out of this?  Okay, I'm going to go, guys.  Oh, man.  You know, you got her scared. 
[02:39:30]  I'm not going to do anything.  Why does she sound scared?  You ever hear a scared woman when she talks like that?  You sound scared, Erica.  Any reason to be?  Well, no.  He just has got a bad day with me, and I have other stuff going on, and I really just don't need it.  I don't have anything going on.  I'm quite afraid for Erica at this point with Spaz.  I understand things, but this man could get out of hand.  I mean, going way beyond punches to the uterus. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Wow, even Mike Tyson afraid.  So, Spaz, are you going to be cool?  Yeah, I'm always cool.  She didn't say anything bad.  She really did.  We'll be keeping tabs on you, Erica.  She was expressing how she felt about your idea.  That's it.  Okay?  Spaz?  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Erica.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes.  Erica.  Calling the witness protection program as we speak.  Jesus Christ.  Do we have to go that far? 
[02:40:30]  We didn't even go that far.  We could have went a lot further.  There was nothing personal in there whatsoever.  No witness protection.  It's a joke.  It's a joke, Spaz.  It's a joke.  That's right, Arthur.  It's a joke.  So, I guess we're going to have to say no to your idea, Spaz.  Okay.  But we weren't expecting it.  You expected it?  Yeah.  Well, all right.  My idea is always good.  Well, Spaz, they're a little outrageous.  Spaz, it's a little.  You've got to admit. 
[02:41:00]  Just for the fact that you didn't want to present this to Jeremy or Ken.  Because we never present ideas to Jeremy or Ken.  All right.  Listen.  We want you to continue bringing ideas to the table.  Okay.  All right.  But that one's just a little far-fetched.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  And be nice to Erica.  I'm always nice to Erica.  You don't know what you got over there.  I do know what I got.  You better count your blessings.  That's right.  That's why you're calling me.  Now, you call her now and tell her how much you love her and stuff. 
[02:41:30]  We don't know what you're calling her.  And we'll be listening in.  And we'll be listening in.  I got a phone call.  Now, you don't throw that.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  That was exhausting.  Oh, my God.  I swear, though, the funniest part about the Erica phone call was before you started playing  all the sounds.  You can hear nature in the background.  You can hear nature sounds.  It goes back to finding out that Spaz lives two and a half hours from the city.  You can really hear it through the phone.  You know, usually we pick up a listener, you know, in Manhattan. 
[02:42:00]  It's like cabbies and sirens and, you know, construction workers.  She calls in.  You hear, like, bald eagles.  Yeah.  I think at one point I did.  I heard, like, a hawk.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Hello?  Erica?  Yeah.  Erica?  And let's take a break, regroup, and we'll be back.  Hello, New Yorkers.  You've been hearing a lot lately about Opie and Anthony. 
[02:42:30]  They're setting new standards in New York radio.  Opie and Anthony.  They're mature.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're educational.  Johnny's starting to grow hair in places he didn't have it before.  And they reinforce family values.  Son, you coming down?  No, I'm not.  Not if you're going to start talking about mom's boobs.  And Sculpey and Anthony heard afternoons on this fine station.  N-B-W. 
[02:43:00]  Lots of instant feedback coming in, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm sharing me from Pinebrook, New Jersey.  Before Spaz gets home tonight, Erica better make sure Ron Goldman isn't coming over tonight.  Hey, uh, Sculpey, I cut myself on a glass I threw when I was upset that they turned down my idea.  Uh, the glove doesn't fit. 
[02:43:30]  They'll have Stinky driving the white Bronco.  Ah, the low-speed chase down the West Side Highway.  I got a kid home.  The two-hour drive to Slope Spur.  I guess a girl called in to be in this porno.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was working with some girl on the phone, right?  Ask him.  Oh, just open the door.  I'll screen to him.  Spaz! 
[02:44:00]  Did a girl call about the porno?  No.  Who were you talking to then?  I was talking to someone right here.  Who's on line three?  Talking to someone about a deal?  Talking to someone about what deal?  But, no.  A deal.  Line three is Gary.  That's his friend Gary.  Oh.  Line three is your porno pal.  All right, pop him down.  Hey, Gary.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up, man?  I wasn't meant to talk.  I'm in the subway at 59th Street now, and you're probably going to be a crappy connection. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Was Spaz offered anything for this video?  No, but it wasn't even at that stage.  He told me that he had mentioned it to Opie, and Opie needed to see something to move  on with it.  Really?  Yeah.  No, that was so cool.  That's why the light up was done.  Yeah, so we could talk about it on the air.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  I mean, come on.  Oh, my God.  And that was it.  Nothing.  The production company hasn't even been spoken to yet.  Yeah.  But this was a good way to get a promotion for a video. 
[02:45:00]  I didn't care.  I was just trying to...  Hello?  Yeah.  Your phone's crabbing out.  No, I'm in the subway.  I was trying to...  I just offered an idea to Kevin.  He was going to see if anything floated.  I didn't care.  All right.  Hey, dude, could you punch that guy in the nuts for us?  Kevin?  Saxophone guy.  The saxophone guy.  Those guys are so annoying.  Yeah.  Well, there's the drunk guy on the train, too, but he's even worse.  They think they're doing us a favor by playing a little saxophone while you're waiting on  the platform, and usually, all of a sudden, there's an announcement about maybe some type 
[02:45:30]  of delay you can't hear because saxophone man is blowing out of tune.  Excuse me.  Please deposit five cents for the next few minutes, or your call will be terminated.  This is a recording.  Cool.  All right, man.  All right, we'll let you go.  Go get your train.  All right.  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Porn producer is everything.  Oh, this is great.  We have to do this.  What's up?  I'm a certified special education teacher, and I would like to test Spaz and find out 
[02:46:00]  on what grade level he is functioning.  Oh, that's pretty good.  The test would only take about an hour to administer and an hour to score.  I even think he's laughing at his head.  He's got to do this.  He's got to do this.  Here, take this and email him back.  I don't care if Spaz has to do it, or he's not going to be part of the show anymore.  Cool.  Let's do that.  Get that person in immediately.  Tomorrow would be great.  All right, Anthony.  Did you hear about the bungee jumper? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Oh, who the hell's bungee jumping?  I don't know.  I don't have the balls to bungee jump.  Even though I guess the death rate is pretty relatively low.  Claims 17 lives in the past 14 years.  And, you know, thousands of people do it, so I guess relatively speaking it's safe, but  you can't tell that to the 17 people.  But this one, they bungee jump out of a cable car.  30,000 jumps successfully made out of this cable car. 
[02:47:00]  And what they do, they could move the cable car, I guess, to a different location, jump further or not further.  They did that as part of one of the road rules.  Yeah.  Where they put the cable car in the middle of a gorge or whatever.  A chasm.  And then a chasm, whatever.  And then they jumped out.  Sure.  Yeah.  Well, this guy, bungee jumper, falls 300 feet to his death.  Head.  He did a header on the pavement.  On the pavement, man.  That's pretty terrible.  Yeah, he's dead. 
[02:47:30]  They're trying to speculate as to what happened.  And they say, well, it was pretty safe.  Shortly before the man's death, two other groups made a 540-foot jump out of the cable car at a different location.  And they're looking into whether they failed to change the bungees from the 540-foot jump to the 300-foot ones.  Oops.  That's about 240 too much. 
[02:48:00]  240 feet.  Yeah.  240 feet of cord too much.  Head first into a parking lot.  Pavement, man.  You know what a head sounds like when it hits pavement from 300 feet?  You ever see those big light bulbs that you used to throw on the ground and they go, poof?  That's what they sound like.  I was at a football game when I was in Buffalo.  Saw a guy. 
[02:48:30]  There was like a hill.  They used to play some sick games while the Bills were playing.  They would play king of the hill.  Yeah.  All right.  There was a sick hill that was all ice and snow.  And basically, there were a bunch of idiots up top and you would attempt to climb up and become king of the hill.  And hundreds and hundreds of people would do this.  And people would slide down and just take your legs out from underneath you and stuff.  It was the sickest thing.  But one guy was like halfway up the hill.  So he might have been 10 to 15 feet off the ground.  Okay?  And this guy just runs full speed from the top of the hill and just takes him out and tackles him. 
[02:49:00]  And I saw live this guy's coconut just split wide open because right at the bottom of this hill is just pavement.  I saw that from 15, just this guy falling 15 feet, his noggin, you know, split wide open.  People were sick for like hours after that.  I got the dry heaves immediately because the sound it made.  It pops.  It pops.  People's heads pop.  So continue with your story.  There's some pressure under there.  Just imagining, you know, seeing a guy hit pavement from 300 feet. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  They actually, it was so bad they had to treat people on the scene for shock just from them seeing it.  But, like I said, relatively safe.  But you'd never, oh man, never.  What about the Super Bowl?  What Super Bowl was that?  That's right.  The halftime show?  Oops.  Where they were practicing the bungee from the roof of the Superdome in New Orleans?  It was there?  Oops.  Oh yeah, for the Tostitos commercial.  And it didn't go so well in practice.  They didn't figure out how much bungee they needed. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, how do you work that out?  I guess with a weight.  And the person slammed into the artificial turf right at the center field there.  Even though it's artificial turf, it's pretty real.  Yeah.  Pretty real when you crack your noggin on it.  Yeah, now a lot of people are calling in with seeing guys get their heads split open.  I don't know.  Oh, I don't want to talk about that.  No, because it is really disturbing when you see it live.  Since there's a bunch of jumping.  All right, Anthony, we've got to take a break.  We're trying to catch up here a little bit.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  I think we're at that portion of the show to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony  show today.  Yeah.  I think we'll do that next, okay?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  What's the line, Anthony?  1027-WNEW.  Oh, I'm talking to myself there.  Oops.  Check the out cue next time.  Phone line, 212-757-1027.  It's time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Anthony, right?  Yeah, I learned George C. Scott will be kicking the crap out of Spaz after he sees his daughter 
[02:51:00]  in a porn place.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  And syndication when Bosch wiper blades come back.  Very good.  Vinny from Rosedale.  I learned earlier in the show Spaz was Timmy from South Park.  Later in the show, I learned Timmy is more normal than Spaz.  Dominique from Jersey.  I learned that the Invisible Man is so popular that if you send Black Girl a self-addressed  stamped envelope, you'll get your very own invisible sticker.  JP from Jersey.  I learned Spaz should take a bunch of something. 
[02:51:30]  And, of course, now let's hit the phones here, man.  Let's go to John.  John, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, surgeon?  How you doing?  Yeah, I learned that the Opie and Anthony couch can hold about 100 porno stars.  100.  100 people on the lesbian couch.  It holds a gross of people.  All right, surgeon.  Over now.  It's a gross.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what did you learn on the show?  Hey, Bob.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  What's up?  Hey, I learned that Spaz is now under investigation in the CIA for being part of a secret underground  terrorist cell that's destroying New York City.  Operation Mayhem.  Hey, guys, put the case on the ground, man.  Thank you.  Eric from Flanders.  I learned that Spaz lives in the jungle.  Stupid Flanders.  I learned that all a girl wants is half.  That's from Chris from Jersey.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  James, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  I learned three things today.  Yeah.  Spaz is going to be the next Oscar-winning director.  Yes.  The Witness Protection Program picked up a new client.  Yes.  And to not write off Earl, but to write off Spaz.  Someone's saying Spaz should drive Earl around in the white Bronco.  That way we get rid of both of them.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, sorry about that.  Chuck, you're next on the show.  Yeah, I learned that since you did an impression of Spaz, I have to do, like, drink a case of 
[02:53:00]  beer.  Of course, you're going to have any drinking game now.  That's right.  I've been doing a little more voices lately.  Rock on.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  I learned that if you want to get a piece from Christina Aguilera, you need to wear your  dress yarmulke.  Yeah.  Miguel from Boogie Down the Bronx.  Move your hand.  Rick Segaria.  I learned that if a college education isn't enough to get ahead in radio, you could go  into porno.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, what did you learn on the show today? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got an extra hundred bucks, and I want to come down here on Thursday before I take my  wife to a play, and I want to be the first one to beat the crap out of Spaz.  Yeah.  We tried that, like, what, a week and a half ago.  No, I think beating the crap out of him might work.  Yeah.  I can't stand listening to him anymore.  All right.  It gets better every week, though, man.  It's amazing.  How do you...  Do you hear something over on you guys?  I mean, how do you keep him on the show?  It's just...  I think we like annoying people. 
[02:54:00]  I mean, I'm convinced we put him on to just annoy the crap out of you guys.  Just to piss you people off.  He's going to get you guys in trouble.  Because people just, like, they'll call us or email us and say, you get me so mad, I'm  pounding my steering wheel in traffic.  Guys, I got an idea.  It's frightening.  Yeah.  It's really...  I tried calling a hundred times.  You got to ask the language, dude.  I know he pisses you off.  I had one of your pictures of the guy who jumped off the 59th Street Bridge.  Yeah.  And I distributed it at work.  Yeah.  I had people running to the bathroom throwing up just from that.
