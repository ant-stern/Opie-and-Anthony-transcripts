<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent, with frequent use of highly offensive language, including homophobic slurs, misogynistic remarks, and graphic descriptions of sex and bodily functions.  Jimmy Norton was a guest in the studio throughout much of the broadcast, and other guests included Joe (who offered to perform self-surgery on-air, a proposition rejected by the show's legal team), Noah (whose sexual orientation was speculated upon), Francine (a prospective news reporter who delivered news in a crude and sexually suggestive manner), and Chuck Farnham (who recounted his experiences with women who enjoyed having their breasts punched).

The show began with a discussion of a purported new, rapidly spreading strain of a sexually transmitted infection, jokingly compared to AIDS, and a news story about a man's rapid progression from HIV to AIDS, accompanied by graphic descriptions and derogatory terms towards gay men.  This was followed by the playing of a song with extremely vulgar lyrics about having AIDS.  The hosts then expressed extreme contempt for Christo's "Gates" art installation in Central Park, referring to it as "orange shower curtains".  Listener calls followed, with callers sharing personal anecdotes about their experiences with HIV, childhoods, pornography, and even a humorous story about working at an orchard. One caller detailed their experiences as a police officer during the Central Park art installation, and another described creating a youth gang called "The Lords".

The show then shifted to reminiscences about obtaining pornography in the pre-internet era, with detailed accounts of scavenging for discarded magazines and using outdated technology to view pornographic films, including the specific film "The Fur Trap".  One host described a unique physical reaction after watching pornography with a friend. The conversation then transitioned to the Grammy Awards, with commentary on Jamie Foxx's Ray Charles impersonation, Chris Rock's controversial Oscars comments, and various performers' appearances and attire. Callers shared their own experiences with pornography, including one story about a mother using a pornographic magazine to teach her child about sex. Another caller described self-performing surgery on a mole. A news story about a woman stabbing another woman to death, possibly to steal her fetus, was also discussed.  A caller, Trish, commented on Chris Rock and her own experience with pornography,  while another caller recounted attending the wrong venue for a Norton comedy show.  Audio of a Grammy’s performance of “Across the Universe” was played.

A later segment began with Joe's rejected offer of self-surgery, followed by the playing of a fatal base jump video with the jumper's screams, and an audio clip of a woman describing her rape experience from an HBO special.  A Stephen Lynch song about a "big fat friend" was then played.  Further calls and discussion about the base jump led into XM Radio advertisements. Chuck Farnham’s call detailed women’s unusual fetish for breast punching. The hosts then attempted, unsuccessfully, to view an Allison Hannigan sex tape. This was followed by Anthony's frustrated rant about their computer malfunction. The show also covered a couple getting married in a shark tank, Jose Canseco’s book detailing steroid use in baseball (including audio clips from interviews), and the allegations against a rabbi who allegedly transmitted herpes and caused the death of an infant through oral suction during circumcisions. The discussion about Canseco’s book focused on his claims of injecting Mark McGwire with steroids.  A box of Godiva chocolates was received and shared during the broadcast.

A significant portion focused on allegations of steroid use in baseball, featuring humorous exaggerations and vulgar jokes about steroid injections.  The hosts discussed Tony La Russa’s denial of steroid use and speculated on the motives of those making the allegations. Audio clips of interviews with a former player who claimed to have injected multiple players, including Rafael Palmeiro, Juan Gonzalez, and Ivan Rodriguez, were played.  Their denials were met with derisive comments.  The conversation included bathroom anecdotes and shifted to discussions of various celebrities and their alleged scandals.

Francine, a prospective news reporter, delivered news stories in a crude and sexually suggestive manner, interspersed with jokes about the gay community.  Her comedy bit and clothing were critiqued by the hosts.  Noah was subjected to speculation about his sexual orientation.  This segment concluded with more news items from Francine and additional off-color jokes.

A final segment included a song with violent and sexually suggestive lyrics, followed by XM Radio commercials and a ski report.  A highly vulgar and sexually explicit conversation ensued with two female callers, “Lady Di” and “Marion”, involving insults about their weight and appearance. Andre joined the call, further escalating the insults towards Lady Di.  The hosts also discussed a friend's birthday celebration in Atlantic City, focusing on details of their sexual activity. The broadcast concluded with listener calls summarizing their “learnings” from the show, more commercials, and the show’s sign-off.

[00:04:00]  We hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites to fight 
[00:04:30]  the forces of evil.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With a cop.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act, act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Spam looks like poorly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Have you ever seen yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it's so nice. 
[00:05:00]  Hawketosis.  Hawketosis.  Hawketosis.  All right, kid.  You're not going to cry.  All right, kid.  I'm going to cry.  Ah!  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just mixed. 
[00:05:30]  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Can I help you, Bob?  Would you?  Say, are you about a size 14?  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told. 
[00:06:00]  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket!  Put the fucking lotion in the basket!  In the basket!  In the basket!  Put the fucking lotion in the basket! 
[00:06:30]  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Hey, good morning!  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  This is the virus that is resistant to all treatment, Opie.  The ONA virus.  Yeah?  New strains of it showing up, untreatable.  And it's happening quicker now.  You get full-blown ONA virus now in a matter of a couple of months. 
[00:07:00]  So it's not going to take like nine years to rebuild this show?  No, no.  It's this new strain of virus.  I don't know.  It's only a couple of people have gotten it this way so far.  But it's looking pretty promising for the show.  That virus just spreads now.  All you got to do is have an ass sex with another man.  And before you know it, you'll love the show.  You just have to have ass sex with another listener that already has the virus?  That has the virus.  And, you know, it used to take a long time to get full-blown ONA virus. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  But now, yeah, a matter of a couple of weeks, and you have it.  Full-blown.  Yeah, because it's a freewheeling show.  Yeah.  Resistance to all treatment.  Oh.  What's that, the new AIDS?  I guess.  Over the weekend here in New York, there's a super strain of AIDS or something like that?  We have a super strain, too.  We in Boston have a super strain, too.  Oh, Boston, could you just relax with the competition against New York constantly? 
[00:08:00]  You guys constantly have to have everything New York has?  Well, explain the super virus, the HIV AIDS super virus, Anthony.  Yeah, apparently in New York they got some guy.  He had HIV, and he only had that for like three months.  People have this for years.  Some people, like Magic Johnson, they just have it forever  and never seem to show any symptoms of getting AIDS, full-blown AIDS. 
[00:08:30]  Nine, ten years.  Yeah, which is like your death sentence.  Once you get the full-blown AIDS, it's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  But you could live with HIV for quite a while.  Well, this guy had the HIV, and he gets full-blown AIDS in a matter of months, three months.  Boom.  The guy goes right to it.  They give him all these drugs.  Yeah, Saturday's paper, Anthony.  Just the headline, sorry.  New AIDS super bug.  New AIDS super bug.  Nightmare strain shows up in city.  They give him the drugs that normally keeps AIDS from popping up. 
[00:09:00]  You get HIV, they put you on these drugs.  Well, they got the powerful cocktails now.  The cocktail.  Ho-ho.  Wasn't that the reason he got AIDS in the first place?  Ho-ho.  Cock and tail.  So the drugs don't work on it.  You just get the super AIDS.  And from what I read about this guy, oh, Jesus.  He was like super fag.  His troll in the neighborhoods downtown getting just had something like 70 partners had to 
[00:09:30]  have been a bottom.  Just getting pounded in the ass.  Just, you're just asking for it.  Gee, we almost have this AIDS thing figured out where people get it.  They give him the drugs.  Everything's fine and dandy.  AIDS, I don't know, seemed to, they were doing a good job preventing it.  And then the gay guys got to relax with the unprotected ass sex, guys.  Well, these guys.  Come on.  These guys, they find out that they got these super, you know, cocktails that keep it under 
[00:10:00]  control.  So they're like, eh, don't need condoms anymore.  We're back, boys.  We're back, boys.  Split them.  Just having the ass sex.  You know, for a long time, a lot of gay guys were afraid to have the ass sex unprotected.  Now, you know, AIDS kind of went away.  They had the drugs.  They figured it out.  And now, you know, you just got to stay away.  You got to roll on the condom or, I don't know, whatever they're doing to keep it safe, 
[00:10:30]  what they were doing for a few years there.  That is just so alluring.  A hairy man ass.  Spread them.  Spread them.  All right.  We're fine now.  That's Sunday.  Get the post from today because I got to get, because the funny thing is the whole Boston  angle.  But go ahead.  You know how good that has to be to a gay guy to just stare into that man ass?  Because it's just the fact that it's so dangerous, yet they keep pounding away at it. 
[00:11:00]  Tell me more, please.  Well, get into bed and smell that musky smell.  You just can't stay away from it.  It's a death sentence.  So we got the new AIDS superbug in New York City.  In New York, we get it.  So now Opie brings up a point in the office.  But I can't get the, Ben, I need today's post.  You guys are killing me.  Oh, today's post?  Sorry.  Oh, you had it the whole time.  Right next to me. 
[00:11:30]  Jesus Christ.  Holding out on you.  So yeah, I mean, it was the headline in the papers over the weekend.  Big headline over the weekend.  New York, AIDS superbug, guys here in New York.  We have a good one.  New York.  That's what it is.  And then Opie brings up a great point in the office.  Yeah, but I can't find it.  It's like, God damn Boston.  Oh, here it is.  It's on page 26 of today's post.  And it's a tiny little article that goes, Boston, too, has super HIV case.  We got the super HIV, too.  We also have it. 
[00:12:00]  Don't ignore us.  And we got two championships.  Yeah.  Yes.  Frigging Boston.  We got the superbug.  We got it.  Yeah, you got it.  Yeah, I can't do the Boston accent, but, you know, you can do the whole fag thing.  Oh, of course.  The Boston accent.  Of course.  They got it, too.  They got whatever New York's got.  We got it.  We got the superbug.  Just the competition between New York and Boston. 
[00:12:30]  And believe me, it's just Boston.  New York really doesn't think about it that much, you know?  But you go up there, and there's just such competition that they felt compelled to say,  we have the AIDS superbug, too.  Oh, congrats.  Hope it works out well for you.  Well, speaking of the new AIDS superbug, listen to this.  All right.  This is called, what is this called again?  Authors of the song?  Jay, what's this called?  It's called full-blown AIDS.  Down to my target weight.  A coma has popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth in all my friends. 
[00:13:00]  Looks like I'm nearing the end.  No, he's telling a lie or even a fib.  When you're lying in bed, counting all your ribs.  You try to give blood, but you shoved me the door.  Well, I went to stand up, and I fell on the floor.  It's full-blown AIDS.  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore. 
[00:13:30]  Damn that whore.  I said, damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  Jay and Mike, just reading what they wrote in front of me.  There you go.  There's an ONA classic.  Cool.  FBA.  It's the PSA for today.  Wear the condoms, boys.  Be careful.  Be careful out there in the big city.  We have super gay people in New York, apparently. 
[00:14:00]  Well, they're like superheroes.  They are so gay.  Downtown, roaming around at those gay bars, taking men home, and just having the unprotected sex.  Knowing, knowing how dangerous it is.  Seventy guys this guy was with, and they're looking for him.  They're looking for all his partners.  Seventy guys just pounding you.  Oh.  God, does that just conjure up an awful image every night? 
[00:14:30]  Night of cosmos and ass sex.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, that same FBA song was played in front of, what, 5,000 people once.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  That was a fun day.  I do have the audio if you want to hear a little bit of it.  Same song done in front of a live audience.  Want to take a quick listen?  Meh.  No?  Meh.  No?  Well, I kind of just heard it. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  I know we got, you know, the crowd behind it, but not a big hit.  You didn't think the FBA was a big hit?  I don't know.  Dude, there's 5,000 people singing along, though.  It didn't age well.  No?  I think.  Yeah.  It's all right, but it's one of Jay Moore's songs, isn't it?  It was up for a Grammy, though.  It was.  I didn't see them.  A star-studded performance of FBA last night.  You only remember the winners.  That's right.  There's a lot of songs that are up for Grammys that never win the prize. 
[00:15:30]  I thought they were going to bring Bono up and all of them, and they were going to sing  FBA last night.  No, they sang a song for the tsunami victims.  Did they do a, it's a tsunami?  They didn't do Rick's song?  I thought they were all going to come out.  Having Bono sing, swim, you bitches, swim.  Swim, you bitches, swim.  Goddamn, Rick.  No.  This guy is claiming that he found out he had AIDS over the weekend. 
[00:16:00]  Stop it.  Then if I can figure out how to go to the phones.  You'll figure it out, Opie.  Keep pushing buttons.  Something will click.  Oh, I think, well, I think I'll do this.  I don't know.  I'm done with my bananas.  I'd love to eat my bagel, but I can't.  Oh, just use that one?  That's your phone.  Oh, nice.  Ooh, nice.  Who got the bagel today?  No problem.  Hey, guys.  Leroy, what's up?  Hey, man.  I don't have AIDS.  I got diagnosed with HIV, though.  Oh, so you got AIDS.  Pretty much, but I'm a hetero, and, oh, by the way, I love the show. 
[00:16:30]  I always wanted to call in, but not for this, but I found out Saturday, and I got it from  my wife and a mate.  Now, how did you get...  Oh.  Oh, you're so full of crap.  No, seriously, I was diagnosed with HIV, and it's when I was working down in an orchard  for Agri-Co, and I left my wife Anna Mae, and it...  Wait, I don't get the bit.  I'm trying to figure it out myself.  I don't get the bit.  Help us out, Leroy.  What's the bit?  You're a little too... 
[00:17:00]  The only Anna Mae I know is Tina Turner, but I know you're not talking about her.  No, I was working for Agri-Co, picking oranges, and it just happened.  My dad was all mad about it.  Somebody stole his piece of chicken out of the refrigerator and said he hoped he choked  on the goddamn bone.  My name's Leroy Jones, by the way.  Which way's up, sucker?  Oh, wow.  That was obscure.  All right.  Yeah, that's a little obscure, my friend.  You did a good job.  All right, what's wrong with your bagel, Anthony?  Oh, um, sir? 
[00:17:30]  Yes, sir?  Sir?  How do I like my bagel every morning?  Nothing on it, but a bagel with onions.  Well, it doesn't have to be an onion bagel, but usually cut in half and toasted is kind  of a good thing.  See, this is just a, you know, bagel.  Throw it at him.  I wouldn't throw it at an intern, Opie.  Throw it at him.  He's got to learn his lesson.  No.  Throw it at him. 
[00:18:00]  I wouldn't throw it at him.  Don't get me a new goddamn bagel!  I wouldn't throw it at him.  You just threw it at him.  I know, but...  He jumped a little bit.  The audience didn't know that.  He did jump a little bit.  Now I feel bad.  Throw it back at him.  No, that's okay.  You can throw that in the garbage.  Yeah.  Because it's trash.  Thank you, my friend.  Now...  The garbage is right...  No, over there.  No, no, no.  Over here.  It's over this...  Yeah, it's over there.  It's over here.  It's near Anthony.  Didn't it?  No?  Oh. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, they moved it over here.  I think it's over by the couch.  Here it is.  Yeah, go over there.  Take it out from underneath your feet, dude.  It's over here.  Look at all the other guys in the control room laughing their asses off.  They love when it's not them.  He just walked around the studio to four different points trying to play the garbage, pal.  Jimmy doesn't like him getting stuff at all.  I won't allow him to touch my food.  Won't allow it.  Really?  Yeah.  I haven't allowed it.  Yeah, I saw him this morning. 
[00:19:00]  He's like, you want to go get something to eat?  No?  No?  No thanks.  You won't let him get your food?  No.  I'll get somebody else.  Why?  Now, why?  Because...  For the exact same reason.  Because he just gets it all wrong.  He's a nice guy, but there's always a problem with the food.  Your eggs have fingerprints in them.  Something creepy.  I figured I would save it with a wrapped up bagel with nothing on it.  It's amazing.  If you wanted to just like, don't do anything to it, it would have been sliced with butter.  Yeah, butter.  Cream cheese.  Did anyone else get to walk in Central Park over the weekend and see the orange shower curtains? 
[00:19:30]  Shower curtains?  Is that what it is?  What a fraud.  This thing is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen in my life.  It's art, Opie.  Get big Kevin on the phone.  He's insane.  He spent a lot of time helping Christo put these things up.  Christo and his wife with the bright red-orange hair.  She's a mess.  We're talking about, of course, the gates.  700,000 losers went to Central Park over the weekend to check out the gates. 
[00:20:00]  I don't understand why you go to Central Park.  I read 700,000 in one of the papers.  That's what I read, too.  700,000.  What does it say in there, Jimmy?  Read the stats.  Read the stats, Jimmy.  All right.  I've got to find them here.  7,500 gates.  7,500 gates.  7,500 gates.  23 miles of orange gates with these.  It's supposed to be saffron.  They're calling it saffron.  Saffron.  It's bright orange, and they just look like shower curtains. 
[00:20:30]  One of the police officers is quoting the paper saying it looks like a huge advertisement for Home Depot.  Oh, yeah.  It is Home Depot color.  It is awful.  Yeah, well, I don't understand why people came because they said a lot of tourists were going to come to New York and look at these.  And I can understand if you're in a helicopter, maybe, and you can look down on the whole thing.  It might look cool, like a bunch of dominoes set up or something.  But to go there, what's the allure to go there and look at a gate and then move? 
[00:21:00]  Like you said, people were moving from one gate to the next, and there were crowds at every single gate.  And they're, what, 10 feet apart, these frigging things?  Well, first of all, they're not gates.  They're doorways, like you explained.  Yeah, you don't walk down gates.  They're doorways with orange shower curtains hanging from above.  That's what it is.  Great.  And you walk in the park and realize everyone's walking around, they're trying to figure it out.  And no one has an answer for this.  And people are going to call up and say, well, you know, it's art and it's what you take from it and this and that. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  It's a fraud is what it is.  The mayor is in cahoots with these two artists, and they figured out a way to get tourism in Central Park in the middle of winter.  I'm telling you, it says 700,000 people were in the park over the weekend.  700,000 people.  All the restaurants that line, you know, the Central Park, completely packed, pumping money into the economy of the city like no one's business. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  But as far as an art project, it's a joke.  We've all been had.  Had.  Dude, you have to go there.  After the show, just go there for five minutes.  You'll laugh your ass off.  I looked down the street when I was walking home, walking to the garage on Friday, and I looked up the street into the park.  The people were already swarming, and I looked and said, there is no way I am going in that park.  Just a mass of dopey people looking at these gates. 
[00:22:30]  It's just a mass of people, so you can't even walk in the park.  And I live close to Central Park.  I love Central Park.  I mean, they're almost every day skating and whatnot, you know, depending on the season.  And there are so many people, even if you wanted to kind of enjoy whatever this thing is, you couldn't, because it was just a massive amount of people.  But I don't get what they're looking at.  Like, if you look at one, you've looked at the whole thing.  Right, exactly.  None of them are different.  They're all identical.  Right.  So if you look at one, you take your picture in front of one, I guess that's it, right? 
[00:23:00]  I don't know.  You're done.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  And no one else knew, because I was asking everybody.  I was literally asking people, what is this?  And everyone's like, well, we really don't know.  And then you had all these dummies that went to Central Park wearing orange to get into the mood of the whole art project.  The mood?  They're wearing orange winter hats, orange scarves, orange coats, orange sweaters.  They're dressing their little doggies up in orange. 
[00:23:30]  One ass that should be shot actually placed an orange gate on his dog's ears.  What?  People are so stupid.  Are they selling things like T-shirts?  Yeah, yeah.  There's vendors all over the park.  Of course.  Big Cav.  Oh, there he is.  All right, I went into Central Park over the weekend with an open mind.  Uh-huh.  Your artist there, Christo, he stinks.  He's the worst. 
[00:24:00]  Now he's your artist.  I know.  This is the biggest fraud I've ever seen in my life.  Why is it a fraud?  Because it doesn't mean anything to anyone.  I asked.  I asked a ton of people.  No one knows what it means.  That's supposed to mean anything.  No one's getting a feeling from it.  Nothing.  You're like, look at...  And it was described as saffron.  It's orange shower curtains.  Shower curtains.  Okay.  Dude, what did you take from it over the weekend? 
[00:24:30]  It's not supposed to mean anything.  I understand that.  But you should be able to get some kind of enjoyment out of it maybe.  Some kind of feeling maybe.  I don't know.  It's just supposed to provide an aesthetic.  It's hacky.  It's hacky at back.  You didn't enjoy it.  You didn't enjoy it.  You didn't take anything away from it.  Dude, this guy is supposed to be a world...  That's okay.  This guy is supposed to be a world-famous artist.  This is hacky.  This is something Anthony and I could have easily done.  This took 25 years.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:25:00]  The date on the charts...  I could have came up with this in five minutes.  Say 1979 to 2005.  It's not a question of how long it took.  It's not a question of whether you could have come up with it and done it.  That's not the issue.  Do you know all the amazing things that have happened between 1979 and now?  All the technology that's come about that just blows away the idea of a bunch of gates in a city?  What's 1979?  I don't get that.  What do you mean?  This is how long...  They first started planning this in 1979. 
[00:25:30]  The concept started in 1979.  It took this long to pull them all together.  7,500 doorways.  They're not even gates, so why are we calling them gates?  Since doorways with shower curtains hanging, one color, orange, not saffron.  You think in 25 years, the guy would have maybe thought, I'm going to throw a little blue in there.  Maybe another color to mix it up just a little bit.  If every shower curtain were different, now that would be amazing.  And then you could look at each one, take something away from it. 
[00:26:00]  It stinks.  And everyone walking around the park, Kevin, you know that people were walking around just trying in amazement like, what the F is this?  Sure.  No one had an idea.  No one had an appreciation.  No one.  I'm going to go see it, though.  I hope it spoke to 700,000 people and no one had a clue.  Well, in my survey, I didn't find one.  And I was asking a lot of questions.  What kind of sample did you take of me?  I was asking a lot of questions. 
[00:26:30]  And most people were like, man, this is really stupid, huh?  That's what I heard over and over again.  This is really just stupid.  Mm-hmm.  What did you take out of it, Kevin?  I think these artists, quote, artists, are frauds and they're in cahoots with the mayor to bring a lot of money into the city.  That's all it is.  If they were in cahoots with the mayor, how come previous mayors said no?  Ah, very good point.  Because the other mayors probably knew he was just a fraud. 
[00:27:00]  But if it was going to bring tourism and 700,000 people, as you say, into the park and the economy, couldn't parts of the city have used this before now?  Yeah.  And what you're going to see from this day on, every year in the middle of winter, some stupid art project in the park to get people to go there in the middle of winter.  No, you're not.  Yes, you are.  No.  No, you're not.  Yes, you are.  No, you're not.  You are.  No, you're not.  Well, hold on, man. 
[00:27:30]  That should tell you something.  If since 1979 every mayor has said no, and the first guy that greenlights it is some wispy pseudo-Republican, I mean, of course.  Well, you've got to realize that for many of those years, they would have been torn down and used for weapons against white people.  It just would have been these big orange spears flying through white people's chests and then wrapping the bodies in orange cloth and throwing them in the lake in Central Park.  But, you know, Giuliani wasn't going to say yes because he was a curmudgeon.  He wouldn't say yes to anything. 
[00:28:00]  And then, I don't know, Bloomberg seems like, you know, he's kind of more appreciative of art than any of the previous mayors.  So, you know, he gave in, and he's a businessman who knows a money-making opportunity when he sees it.  And he's a little limp-wristed.  Do you think he's a little gee?  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on there, but he's a little limp-wristed.  Does he have a chick?  I think he has a beard.  Does he have a wife or a girl?  I don't even know if the mayor of New York is married or not.  Because he's keeping that type of thing very secretive. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I don't know what the hell's going on with that guy.  John from New York, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Yeah, I was over there during the weekend.  I'm a city cop.  For eight and a half hours, I had to hear about people who planned their vacations.  I went stunk.  Wow.  Yeah, a lot of people plan their vacation from all over the world to see this thing.  Eight hours of staring at these drapes.  Well, if you planned your vacation and then get there and are disappointed, what were you expecting? 
[00:29:00]  You know?  What was anyone expecting aside from looking at the gate?  If that's what you wanted to do and you wanted to see these gates, fine.  Go snap some pictures.  Snap 7,500 pictures next to each and every one.  Yeah, as a goof, I would have gave the artists maybe a tiny piece of the park.  Not the whole park for this mess.  It's not art.  You know what art is?  You look at a painting.  Maybe there's a ball with some fruit in it.  That's art.  Some guy painted it.  Why is that art? 
[00:29:30]  That's art.  Yeah, Kev.  It looks nice.  Kev, it's hacky.  You got to admit it.  I like poker playing dogs.  No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's art.  Jim, why is that art?  What's that?  Why is a bowl of fruit art?  Ah, you just hang it in the living room.  It's classy.  Why?  Shows people you got class because you look at it and they'll go, hey, is that some fruit?  And you'll go, yeah.  So art has to be something.  Attaboy.  Yeah.  You know what I think art is?  You know what I like?  I saw these paintings once.  They're these nude black women with big afros. 
[00:30:00]  I hung one over my bed.  I hung another one across the room.  If somebody was standing at the foot of your bed looking past your awful black toes, would  they see it?  Absolutely would.  Yeah, I like the poker playing dogs.  That's good art.  I like Velvet Elvis paintings.  Velvet Elvis is nice.  Things like that.  That's art.  I got that Kramer thing.  You got the Kramer?  I got the Kramer.  That's art.  You hang it up on the wall.  You look at it, you know what it is.  It's artistic. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  This, I don't know.  It's crap.  I don't think it's art.  Dude, it's really stupid.  It's really dumb.  And you know what?  We have to get someone to go out there in the park and interview these people.  Because you'll get some great audio.  Oh, that's a good idea.  You'll get some great audio.  Just ask the question, what does this mean to you or whatever.  We should come up with three or four questions.  I'm telling you.  How does it affect you now that you've seen it?  Yeah, that's great.  Definitely send people down there.  All right.  Kev, I'm sure you're very proud of participating in this. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, there he is.  Go ahead.  Kev?  Send me.  I'm sure you're very proud of participating in this.  Yeah.  But I guess we just don't get it.  Uh-huh.  Call us stupid.  No, I won't call you stupid.  You don't...  If you didn't take anything away from it, I'm not going to call you stupid.  You're not sitting around, Kevin, with the other artsy types that you hang out with and discuss this for hours on end, are you? 
[00:31:30]  You haven't seen his friends, Opie.  They're not artsy types.  They're nerdy types.  I've been to the Christmas parties.  A bunch of comic book reading pedophiles.  Yeah, that's it.  Wow.  All right, Kev.  I don't know what to tell you.  I went there with an open mind.  I really did.  But I was overwhelmed at how stupid it was.  Stupid.  I'm sorry that you weren't able to appreciate it.  And, you know, to call it saffron, it's ridiculous. 
[00:32:00]  Home Depot orange.  It's Home Depot orange.  And it has a shower curtain feel to it.  Mm-hmm.  Or maybe, you know, when you go under, when you take your car for a car wash and that thing comes over it.  Oh, it looks like a big, giant, 26-mile-long car wash.  Yeah, where the little things come down and they're all sudsy.  Yeah.  And they take your windshield.  Wow.  All right, Kev.  Thank you, Kev.  If you have anything else to add to this, because you've added nothing, calls back when you wake up. 
[00:32:30]  Jesus.  Yeah, well, what am I...  Oh, you're up on them.  You are cruel.  Least thing, the least I could do.  I wasted time trying to figure this thing out.  Wasted time.  I really wasted time.  Maybe that's what the artist wants, is for people to walk away going, I don't get it.  That's a real artist.  Yeah, not someone that could, you know...  Hey, you guys want a figure of a human being to a T out of marble. 
[00:33:00]  That's nothing.  Right.  Anyone could do that.  You guys want to wake up everybody?  What?  What?  Warning, warning, C-word alert, C-word alert, warning, warning.  Wow.  Ooh.  What do you think?  What do you got?  Well, it's Valentine's Day.  Happy Valentine's Day.  It's Valentine's Day, so what do you think?

[00:35:30]  Whoa, cunt, the word was made for you, can't I do that, but, but, cunt, the word was made for you.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up.  Yeah, you need a driver there, buddy. 
[00:36:00]  Who's this?  This is Jake, calling about the job, driving, I saw it in the paper.  Yes.  Yeah, well, you still need a driver or what?  Uh, did you feel an application with us, Jake?  Pardon me?  Huh?  Speak up there, what did you say?  You feel an application with us?  No, no, no, no, look, I saw it here in the paper and I'm calling you, fruitcake, I'm looking for a job driving a truck.  We're looking for movers.  Yeah, well, that's what I do.  What class driver's license do you have?  I got five, one, two, three, four, I got them all. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, class what?  Yeah, I drive buses, trucks, I'll back a truck through the fucking, uh, two-family house garage.  One of those big two-ton trucks.  When was the last time you drove a truck to Trader?  Oh, jeez, what the fuck?  I'd say about two weeks ago, I robbed one down in Jersey and I drove it up here to New York.  Fucking flying.  Drove it through the tolls, no stopping, no nothing.  I'm good.  I said, why don't you call, uh, go back on Monday.  Hey, I'll tell you what, I come in, I'll take you for a test spin.  How's that? We go out and we take the truck around the fucking block. 
[00:37:00]  I speed, I pop wheelies, I'm good, baby.  All right, can I get you? I want you.  You sound good, you and me. We make a team. You drive with me.  All right?  What's your name again?  Jake.  Hey, who did you work for, Jake?  Oh, jeez, I worked for Moish, I worked for, uh, Mayflower, you know?  Oh, yeah, don't, hey, I was good with them, too.  You worked with Moish's?  Yeah, that's right.  When?  Eh, about, what, two years ago?  See, what I got problem there, they get fucking scared when I pop the wheelies and all that shit. 
[00:37:30]  You know, I pop a lot of wheelies. I'm good with that shit.  You know, I don't break no merchandise.  See, I get it there two hours ahead of time, all the time.  What do you say?  Say, if you pop any wheelies there, I'm not even gonna put it in your position.  Ah, listen to me. I don't break nothing, sizzle chest. I'm good.  Okay, come on there, we'll, uh, set up an interview.  Okay?  All right, I'll do that there, Rubberneck. I'll call you Monday.  Okay.  All right, fruitcake. See you later.  Happy Valentine's Day to everybody. 
[00:38:00]  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  A little Jimmy Norton in studio.  Jimmy had some great shows down there in, uh, Eatontown, New Jersey.  Yes.  You were down in Eatontown?  Yes. 
[00:38:30]  I didn't even know about that show.  I kind of kept it on the down low.  You really did.  Pat from Wynaki was there.  Oh, fuck.  It was a big hit Friday night.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  A big, big hit.  Is he, like, famous now? People are coming up to him and stuff, taking pictures with him?  They all cheered him. I inroad him from the stage, and they all cheered him. He's still  up in the back.  Hold on one second.  Oh, no. I wanted to hear that part.  There you go.  All right.  Thanks, Derek.  So, uh, it was, it was, uh, successful down there, huh? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, it was great, man. Yeah, really good weekend. I know I'm eating, but, uh, we don't have  long enough time.  Did everyone go and start going, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, when you introduced him?  They all clapped, and he just kind of stood up and, like, shyly waved.  Yeah, those big arms, you know, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  Of course, I mentioned the fact that he had nine toes. I forget what I said, but it was  something inappropriate about his diabetes.  Of course it was. You said it.  Yeah, he had some funny lines about his diabetes, actually, from the stage.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado. Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys, have you seen the new Playboy yet? 
[00:39:30]  With, uh, Debbie Gibson?  Yeah.  Yeah, that whole, uh, celebrity thing, posing nude is getting old, and I'll tell you why.  Yeah, it's getting old, but I'll tell you why, she's fucking hot.  Yeah, but she doesn't show anything.  She doesn't?  She doesn't show, they sell beaver shots, but...  Do you see Snatch?  No, you don't see Snatch.  None at all? No hair?  No, she has this, like, uh, she has, like, this, uh, what was it, a necklace or a belt that...  The one shot, she's holding a hat over it, the other one, uh, uh, I think it's, like, a belt or something she's covering with. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, it's some kind of wacky necklace or belt that just happens to cover the area perfectly.  Clever ways to hide it.  I mean, it's, uh, even still.  I mean, I'll tell you what, I was comparing her pictures to those of, uh, Tiffany that came out last year.  Her pictures are a lot better.  Remember the big Debbie Gibson-Tiffany fight of the, uh, 80s?  And then, uh, the joke was, you know, which one's gonna end up in Playboy first? 
[00:40:30]  And, uh, and Tiffany...  Funny is, when Tiffany closed, Debbie Gibson said she would never do it.  Oh, really? She did say that?  They all say they'll never do it.  The trick is, you gotta do it when you're hot, when, uh, the people wanna see you.  If Tiffany and Debbie Gibson did some kind of a dyke thing in Swank Magazine in 1985, you know, maybe then...  Well, I agree with you, because, uh, I was looking at the Debbie Gibson spread, and yeah, she's really hot and stuff,  but it just annoys me, because, you know, Playboy gets these has-been, uh, singers and actresses, 
[00:41:00]  and they get them to pose by saying, look, we'll, we'll do, uh, very artistic photos, and, and it'll be more of an art thing than, than, you know, porno.  Playboy stinks.  I mean, Debbie Gibson, she's, I mean, she's not really a has-been.  She's been big on Broadway still.  Yeah.  So what?  So is Nathan Lane.  You wanna see him naked?  Playboy blows.  Dude, like I said, a has-been.  Trust me.  She'd rather be selling, you know, uh, uh, hit albums.  I mean, you really wanna see...  You know, every time you hear, you hear one of their little songs, you're gonna spring wood now.  All right. 
[00:41:30]  Thank you, bro.  Later.  He's chatty.  They have this, this phony sense of, like, legitimacy, because they don't show hardcore.  That's what I mean, and that's what's driving me...  And it stinks.  If they're, if they're not showing pink, then they're not really posing for any of these magazines.  But they think that's classy.  It's called being classy.  Hustler is, is what a mag- Hustler's honest about the agenda.  This is what I'm looking at it for.  I want to look like a gynecological, an exam magazine.  You're right.  Filthy.  You're right.  Playboy fills the gap between, uh, people that can have that in their house and the 
[00:42:00]  poor sons of bitches that are pussy whipped by their wives that can't have porno in the  house.  But for some reason, they've been able to talk their wives into, uh, letting them get  Playboy because that's not really porno.  There are articles in it, interviews with politicians, things like that.  And then the occasional naked girl without, uh, you know, hubba-bubba hanging between her  and her knees.  So, you know, it serves its purpose.  And, for first-timers, you know, you're a kid, you get your hand on a Playboy, that  might as well be hardcore pornography. 
[00:42:30]  Anthony, not anymore, though.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  And, I mean, you know, you make some good points, but, I mean, Jim makes a good point  about the honesty issue, you know.  I mean, she's still, she's still showing her whore side.  I mean, who's she kidding?  Not if you ask her.  Keeps that private so no one can see it.  That's what I want to see.  That's the only thing I'm interested in.  They could cut the head off.  I don't need to see the head.  It's given me such freedom.  The reason I did this was, I don't know, it's an outlet, it's just a freeing experience  from, shut up, the paycheck. 
[00:43:00]  That's why she did it.  Yeah, because she, you know, wants her name in the press again.  All these people that do this, they do it for the check and the publicity.  It's just, yeah, it's just an avenue to get your name back up on top for a little while.  There you go.  And then maybe someone will pay attention to her latest song or maybe give her some kind  of role in a movie.  That's all.  You know, but to act like it's artistic and stuff.  No, you're showing desperation and you're, you know, you want people to start talking  about you again.  Right.  But to sit there, I watched her on all these shows, you know, the shows were, the shows, 
[00:43:30]  the shots were done in an artistic fashion.  Yes, they were.  They're very classy.  Look at this one, you know.  Yes, I'm dressed in orange cloth.  It's saffron.  It's art.  I swear.  So, you're right about the honesty issue, you know.  If you're going to do it, you should just do it.  Yeah.  We'll see in the future, I guess, like Christina Aguilera, things like that.  Britney.  You think Britney will spread them for Playboy?  Yeah, without a doubt. 
[00:44:00]  She might even go to Hustler.  I think Britney does it before she, you know, starts the down.  The downward spiral.  The downward spiral.  She's already pretty much the has-been, isn't she?  I don't know about that.  Every day there's a picture in the paper.  Yeah, but as far.  The bob hairdo now, the short haircut.  Yeah.  It kind of stinks, yeah.  No, she wore that for a day.  She's such trash.  I love it.  She wigged out.  Yeah, remember?  Yeah, we were talking about that last week.  She wigged out for a day.  But she threw the wig on just so she could go out.  Yeah, but I'm not saying she's not still huge in the news and stuff, but as far as a singing 
[00:44:30]  career goes, how relevant is she these days?  Well, she threw the Greatest Hits package out.  Greatest Hits, that's pretty much, that's all I had, people.  That's all I had.  Now here's the Greatest Hits of it, and I'm done.  You go Greatest Hits, then you go Live Album.  Or do you go Live Album first and then Greatest Hits?  I think Live first.  Live first usually and then Greatest Hits.  Yeah, because you might need some of the live cuts.  Greatest Hits with that one song.  That wrecks the Greatest Hits album always.  The one no one cares about because it's new. 
[00:45:00]  It's always in the last position because even the artist knows.  It's crap and no one wants to hear it.  It's something like, just name some stupid band, like Styx, Styx Greatest Hits.  It's like one after another, you know all these songs, and then this last freaking song  they're hoping you're going to like.  Something new that sounds like the old stuff with updated lyrics.  They're talking about like, that's what you want to hear.  A band like Yes puts out at Greatest Hits or something, and they write a new song, and  it's about like the internet. 
[00:45:30]  It sounds just like a song that came out in 1975, but you know, it's about computers and  you know, the new stuff, and the Iraq War.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God, this blows.  Shut up.  Really just awful.  Whining.  Let's say hi to Ted.  Hey, Ted.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Hello.  Jimmy, you're awesome show Friday night.  Thank you, Ted.  Thank you for attending.  Hey, I was sitting real close to where Pat from Unak was, and Jimmy introduced him as, 
[00:46:00]  you'll know him, he's the guy with the safety pin in his sock instead of the 10th toe.  Oh, did I say that?  Yeah.  Safety pin in his sock.  That's classic.  He has to pin it over.  Pin it over like the sleeve with the one-armed guy.  That's what it was, yeah.  Oh, that is funny.  That's very good.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  George, what's going on?  Not much, man.  Toy Boy does suck.  When I was 13, I was introduced to porn through High Society and Hustlers. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, High Society was great.  I used to like Wii.  Remember Wii?  I used to steal it out of a machine, yes.  That was great.  That's the porno, man.  Like, High Society, like this guy is talking, just skank whores in that one.  You get to see all the pimples.  Yeah, just a mess.  There's no airbrushing.  Big thatch of a patch.  Oh, awful.  Yeah, it was great.  You definitely worth the extra two bucks a month.  Thanks, fella.  Thank you, my friend. 
[00:47:00]  I remember in the hotel that was probably about a half a mile from my house, me and my buddies  used to go, and we had screwdrivers.  They had porn vending machines.  They had Wii and Penthouse.  Porn vending machines?  Yeah.  It was like a holiday inn or whatever.  It was like a little local dive hotel, and they had porn vending machines.  In Jersey?  Oh, yeah.  It was on Route 1 in North Brunswick.  And we would go with screwdrivers and jimmy them and steal the new porn.  Yeah.  And I was such a sex addict, even in like fifth or sixth grade, I couldn't look at it  until I was alone, and I could just kind of like rub myself.  Like, I couldn't look at it with my friends. 
[00:47:30]  You couldn't even look at it?  With my friends.  No.  Wow, really?  I never got into looking at porn with my friends.  I would always have to do it alone.  I had a big stash up in a tree fort, and yeah, friends would come by.  It was like a nightclub, you know?  I'd look, no, you, you, you.  Okay, come on in.  Come on in.  No, you're not dressed right.  Get out of here.  Velvet rope.  We didn't.  Get in the tree fort and just hand out the porno, and you'd look at it.  We had an underground tree fort.  An underground tree fort.  Well, it depended on the neighborhood, man.  That's a root fort.  Yeah.  I know, I know. 
[00:48:00]  Well, but it was that same, you know, feel.  It was a huge piece of plywood that we would cover with leaves and stuff.  And, wait a minute, you dig a hole?  Yeah, a massive hole.  And you cover it with plywood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had, like, candles and stuff down there, and that's where our porn was.  I like the tree fort better, the high ground.  Well, we had those, too.  I mean, we had all sorts of different varieties of the fort.  Yeah.  The underground one was pretty cool, though, because it was, like, honestly, it was, like,  eight feet down.  Really?  Yeah, it was huge, man.  And enough room side to side? 
[00:48:30]  Pretty much, yeah.  I'm trying to remember now.  It was probably six by ten feet, probably.  The work you used to put in as a kid to, like, make things like that.  And that was kind of easier, because all you needed was the big piece of plywood.  But a tree fort was, like, you had to go out to, like, places where they were building houses.  Oh, yeah.  And steal the wood.  And get, like, your dad's saw and hammer and a few nails.  And there you are, engineering a place that goes in a tree.  You needed truss work. 
[00:49:00]  And, you know, you have to get up and put those initial cross beams across the trees.  And they never fell down, you know?  It's like kiddie engineering.  You kind of knew you needed this.  And you didn't know where you learned it from or anything.  But you kind of knew how to build this structure that didn't collapse when five guys are up in there.  I remember amazing.  When I was a boy, we were going to make a gang in North Brunswick.  We were such faggots.  Oh.  And we were going to call...  A gang.  I swear to God, we were kind of like, let's make a gang.  We were going to call it the Lords. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, 1955, Jimmy.  It's atrocious.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang.  About, hey, I'm Jimmy Robinson, eh?  Hey.  At the war.  Patsy, over here.  Get under the porch, eh?  Hey.  Monster rain, a hobble, a hobble.  But no, they were going to build a fort, and me and my friend, like, were so lazy, we said that we volunteered to go to the hardware store and get the letters.  Because we were going to write our gang name.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:00]  Gang name.  Gang name.  On the front of the little hangout place.  And that was what me and him did.  Went and picked out letters.  Letters.  F-A-G-G-O-T-S.  Please, yeah.  We had, like, instead of a door, just a big piece of orange cloth that we could walk through.  A bunch of fruits.  The Lords.  You're a jet all the way from your first day.  Yeah.  To your last dying day.  We're the Lords.  You're a jet.  Let them do what they can.  You've got brothers around. 
[00:50:30]  You're a family man.  You're never alone.  You're never disconnected.  Honk, honk.  You're home with your own.  The company's expected.  You're well protected.  Here come the Lords.  And you'll stay with the capital J, which you'll never forget till they cart you away when you're a jet.  You.  Oh, my God.  The Lords.  The Lords.  Oh, I can't wait to see Whack Bag for the pictures they're going to make of that one.  Go to Photoshop on WhackBag.com.  Oh, how many leather jackets they're looking for on Google Images right now. 
[00:51:00]  We're, like, in seventh grade.  Just tools.  Oh, complete idiots.  Why the Lords, though?  I don't know.  I mean, why would they go to build something and let me and my dumb friend go pick out letters?  I mean, there's no real reason for it.  We're homos.  Who are you, Knicky?  We're all over the ball field today.  Let's say hi to Tony in Miami.  Tony!  What's up, Jack and Screech?  What's going on?  What's up, Tony?  Hey, hey, listen.  The first thing I was exposed to, of all porn, I was, like, eight. 
[00:51:30]  My brother was, like, a twisted ass freak.  Kids are usually, like, playboys and hustlers.  He had Puritan.  Do you remember that porn?  Sure do, yeah.  Puritan was, like, the hardcore ass fucking porn.  And my brother had, like, a huge, like, fucking pile of Puritans.  And one time I rubbed one out, and I left one out, I guess.  And I went downstairs, and my mom's this little old German lady, right?  And I guess she found it, and she's like,  Hey, found something in your room. 
[00:52:00]  And I'm like, Oh, shit.  And she goes, That's a hardcore porn!  So she started, like, freaking out, and she just,  I'm punching out.  Peace.  Oh, he didn't even let me get to the crash.  The best part was we all just started looking at each other, like,  What?  What?  What?  What's going on here?  I'm hitting buttons, cheering up for the crash.  I'm just waiting for him to stop and hit the crash, and he punched out.  He could sense that you were looking for, what are those white things called?  The template.  That he knew you were looking to.  It was so quiet, he could hear the shuffle of the papers. 
[00:52:30]  See, that's a punch out.  You can't punch out when you're done.  Some people get the crash, and they go, All right, I'm punching out.  It's too late.  You're a ditch in the ground.  Mike from Jersey.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  All right, good.  Good.  I got a good story.  Down the road from my house when we were kids, there was a piece of road there.  People used to flip stuff out the window all the time.  So occasionally you'd find a magazine on the side of the road.  But there was one day in particular that we were riding our bikes down the road, a friend  of mine, and I, and we saw a magazine over on the side. 
[00:53:00]  It was probably about a football field away, so we both raced as fast as we could to see  who could get it first.  We both got it at the same time.  We wound up getting an old fight over who's going to get to look at the magazine first.  It was kind of funny.  You could rip it in half.  Hold on.  It was pretty funny.  It was actually Cherry Magazine.  I don't know if you guys remember that one.  I certainly do.  I remember Cherry, yeah.  However, that wasn't funny.  Just to clarify, it wasn't funny at all.  Just to let you know, that wasn't really a funny story.  But it was interesting.  Go ahead and crash me.  No, it wasn't bad.  No, it was good.  West Virginia checking in. 
[00:53:30]  It's John.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, John?  Hi, Jimmy, you beefy tits.  Hi, John.  Let's not be insulting now.  It's Valentine's Day.  Hey, I was eight years old.  My dad introduced me to the two best pornos, Porky's and Roadhouse.  I'm punching out.  Porky's and Roadhouse.  You know what magazine stunk?  Easy Rider.  That trash laying around.  What the hell was Easy Rider again?  It was that biker magazine, but it had naked chicks in it, too. 
[00:54:00]  But they were the skankiest biker whores that you'd ever, ever see.  And it was like the...  I mean, if you're jacking it to the Sears catalog bra section, it might be good because it's probably a little better than that to jack to.  But just those awful biker chicks, very selective magazines.  Can you start with National Geographic, though?  No, always Playboy.  Started with Playboy.  Yeah, but you couldn't just get your hands on that when you were really little.  Let me think.  National Geographic might have been... 
[00:54:30]  You know, you might be right.  I mean, you graduate up to the porn magazines, you know, because National Geographic, you start realizing that they're just awful naked women in there.  Yeah, well, it was, you know, the African women.  But at first, it was just the, oh, my God, naked women.  Then you have to go, you know, you're jonesing for more and more.  And then you eventually get up to the real porn magazines.  But you have to start somewhere.  National Geographic.  And with me, it was National Geographic.  We're going through the dictionaries and stuff and, I don't know, just finding...  Oh, you'd have to find wherever you could, yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Wherever you could.  A dictionary.  Well, that's a bad example.  Whatever.  Medical book.  Yes.  You know, any type of books that the parents had around the house, you're leafing through, hoping to, you know, catch a glimpse of something.  You find a medical book and, like, thumb through it and find a picture of a woman with her eyes covered over with a black strip so you can't tell who she is kind of a thing.  And, you know, it's a whole thing on psoriasis or something, so she's naked with psoriasis, but she's naked.  That's exactly what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about. 
[00:55:30]  And then you have to find whatever you could.  Yeah, and then eventually you start figuring out how to get your porn magazines.  It's like Thalidomide Woman.  She's got little flipper arms, but she's naked.  Like, you know how I got my first porn magazines?  I had a paper route.  Yeah.  And I noticed that, you know, people would, like, just leave, you know, their paper and their magazines bundle up for the garbage man.  And, you know, you look through the stacks of that long enough, you'll find a porn magazine.  Yeah, they put them in the middle of the stack. 
[00:56:00]  You know, it took some doing, and you would have to spend maybe a whole afternoon literally going from house to house.  You know, I had scissors and everything, just, you know, cutting the rope that was tied around it.  And every once in a while, I'd hit pay dirt.  Kids just do not understand how lucky they are today with the Internet.  It is amazing.  I mean, years ago, you did.  You had to, it was like a treasure hunt.  You were just hunting around for a photo, anything, one picture of a nude woman. 
[00:56:30]  I remember my first porn movie.  I was, I'll never forget, my buddy was an Indian fellow who lived across the street, and his dad had a VCR back in those days.  Old cinnamon lips.  Yeah.  They certainly were, and his parents hated me.  But, you know, back in those days when, like, there were very few VCRs, and I went and watched a porno with him.  We sat on the floor of his dad's room and watched The Fur Trap with Kelly Mint, and it's an awful porno.  The Fur Trap, huh?  I had to walk out of his room and lay on the bathroom floor and whack my bag.  Really? 
[00:57:00]  You were just so worked up.  I was laying on his parents' bathroom floor in his Indian people's house with my head on the tile, scrapping all over myself.  Now, to this day, whenever he smells curry, he explodes on his stomach.  I just couldn't handle it, but I could never watch with other people and enjoy porn.  I had to, when I was a kid, once we found a super 8mm film.  Oh, my God.  Porno film.  How old are you?  Dude, it was years ago.  It was before, yeah, before friggin' VCRs, like the mid to late 70s. 
[00:57:30]  And had nothing to play this time.  That's when your parents dropped you off at your friend's house with a horse and buggy?  I mean, what ear are you from?  Jesus.  It was a long time ago.  So, now our quest, we had to find a super 8mm projector.  You knew it was porno, though?  Yeah, because we unraveled a little bit of it.  But how much can you get looking at a small 8mm film?  So, I mean, we were ready to tear the whole thing off the reel just to get each individual picture. 
[00:58:00]  But I said, no, let's try to get a projector.  Finally ended up going to my alma mater, John H. Glenn High School, and telling one of the AV teachers that we needed it.  We have a film about, it was something about history, we said, to help us study for a big test that was coming up.  And they let us sign out a projector.  Went to my friend Frank's house, who lived right around the corner from the high school.  Set up the projector and watched porno on the school's movie projector. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I know.  And it was just threading it through.  And finally you turn that on and...  Seeing porno like that.  The worst 70s big earth mama muff.  Bad washed out color film.  But it was great.  Pay dirt.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Hard to get your porn out.  Did you go to any of the porn theaters on Long Island growing up?  Went to one.  Bayshore, I think, was one of them.  Yeah, Bayshore was the one.  Yeah, I went to it when I was working at some place.  Dude, we went just as high school guys. 
[00:59:00]  We'd drink beers and then pay our admission and go in there.  But you felt so like, you know...  You had to go with a bunch of guys.  Oh, yeah.  It was like a night out.  But there was a bunch of perverts in there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But it was like, yeah, this is a cool thing to do.  We'll drink a bunch of beers on the way over and we'll go to the porno theater.  We went with a bunch of people from work once.  They just decided, yeah, let's go to the porno.  You know, we went down there, Bayshore, sat down and just laughed our asses off watching  the porno.  But it's like any other place, like even a strip club.  You get the group of guys that are friends there to drink beer and glance over at the 
[00:59:30]  girl.  But then you get the guy in the corner that's just drooling and telling the girl that  she looks like his daughter, you know, giving dollars and stuff.  There are certain classifications of guys.  There's the naive guy that just keeps giving his money away, the guy that thinks he's going  to get something, the only black guy in the white strip club, the old guy.  You know, you get those groups in the porn theaters, too.  This is a perfect Valentine's Day show.  Yeah.  It's all about love. 
[01:00:00]  Why don't we take a quick break?  The phones have exploded.  We'll stay on this topic for a little while.  Then we have to talk about the Grammys and Jose Canseco and I'm trying to think what else.  We have a ton of things to try to get to today, all right?  Right.  But as we go to break, some more love songs that we like on this fine Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Another ditty from Stephen Lynch.  That it's your duty to find your lass with child-bearing hips in a pink suplass 
[01:00:30]  and make her your wife and lover with love so true.  Now some rivers run high, some rivers run low.  When her river runs red, then she's starting her flow.  When it's called menstruation, here's what it means to you.  You will notice her bloomers are spotty at first.  Stand back, her ovarian dam's gonna burst. 
[01:01:00]  Son, don't be afraid, it's a natural thing.  Just wad up some cotton in hand or a string  and put the old linens on top of the bed.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  Hundreds of years old.  That's why bloomers.  Aye.  Aye.  She'll retain her water, her breasts will be tender.  Say something nice and you're sure to offend her.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead. 
[01:01:30]  She'll want to make love if you do.  You're a fool, you'll only end up with a bloody old tool.  Now get out of the house, go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want you to sample the fruit of her loins,  but son, it'll taste like some old rusty coins.  So turn off the light and take off your hat  and drop to your knees.  Say a prayer to St. Pat that'll give you the strength to get out of the bed  and for Ireland's sake, go down to the old pub instead.  I feel a solo coming on. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, really?  Perhaps right here, Anthony.  Very good.  Now the pub is the place where the lads are a-meeting  when the moon is full and the gals are a-bleeding  the Catholic, the Protestant, even the pagan  the pub is the place when your lady is ragging  so drink of your pint, boys, and thank your Samrocks 
[01:02:30]  that as menfolk we don't have to bleed from our c***  and that we can escape from the lady in red  and get out of the house  and go down to the old pub instead.  Down to the old pub instead.  Nice.  Thank you, my lads.  Thank you so much.  Raise your glass.  Find me good.  Have a drink.  The very worst of the opiate Anthony have you liked. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, that's for Lady Dye.  Okay, a job application is not a cardboard sign  that says we'll work the food.  Instead of taking a bus, fall under one.  Fuck you, you miserable excuse for a human being.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, you're so funny.  Stupid fucking idiot.  I want to send a big F you out to Opie, Anthony,  and Lil Norton.  Every morning I listen to the show  and I have to listen to see what's going on  and just when I feel it's safe to go to the kitchen 
[01:03:30]  and get something to eat before I have to go to work,  that play that fucking eggnog puking shit  or Norton snot or farting  and then it ruins my breakfast for me.  So I just want to say, fuck you.  Fuck you, New Orleans.  Fuck you, Tom the Drunk.  And fuck you, Fat Tuesday.  Yeah, I wanted to give a big F you to my buddy Rick.  We went out to see Brother Joe's band.  I was lucky enough to get a picture with Brother Joe  and he fucked it up. 
[01:04:00]  Half of my head, half of Brother Joe's head.  Hey, I got a big fuck you to the dumbass  that decided to run from the state police  over here in Pennsylvania on the Southbound 81.  I just sat in a fucking hour-long traffic backup  because this douchebag decided he was going to try to outrun the cops.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.

[01:06:30]  To the heart of me.  The love we share.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Seems to go nowhere.  And I've lost my light.  For I toss and turn.  I can't sleep at night.  Once I ran to you.

[01:07:00]  I don't know.  Ah.  Tainted love, did it?  Tainted love.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Wow.  All right.  Let's get back into the program here.  Let's say hi to Joe.  I guess Joe was at the Norton shows over the weekend.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey.  How do you do, Joe?  Hey, Norton.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I've got a funny little story. 
[01:07:30]  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Wait, what did you say?  I've got a funny little story.  Funny little story.  All right.  Hold on.  We like to strap in for these funny stories.  Thank God you said that, because if you just came out with it, a funny story, that could  be dangerous to people driving and stuff.  Guys in the booth, you guys ready for a funny story?  All right.  Thumbs up over there.  Put on your laughing hats.  Eric, you ready over there for a funny story?  It's nice and early.  We all need a good chuckle.  All right.  Anyway.  Ben's giving his thumbs up in the office. 
[01:08:00]  I think we're all ready for the funny story.  All right.  Let me sit back down.  All right.  Sit down, Opie.  What are you raising?  I'm insane.  I'm insane.  Don't stand.  All right.  Me, my girlfriend, and another couple.  We got the tickets for Norton, right?  At the stress factory.  And I should have known better.  My friend's like a complete moron on the internet.  So he gets the directions for the stress factory.  So we get down there.  And not the one we were supposed to be at.  But Keith's on there. 
[01:08:30]  Keith, I forgot his name.  He's going to be on your show later this week.  Keith Robinson.  Yeah, exactly.  So he's in the middle of his act.  And I'm like sitting up front.  I was like, so when is Norton coming out?  And he goes, Norton?  He's like, you're at the wrong place, fella.  I was like, what do you mean?  He's like, Norton's at the other stress factory.  And he goes, oh, you want to hear some Norton?  So he did some Norton bits on stage.  It was hilarious.  And then what happened was we talked to somebody, whatever, and they sent us to the one in, was it the Ramada Inn or wherever it is? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we get there.  And I got to thank the guys from the stress factory.  They hooked us up.  They gave us free tickets, free drinks when we got there.  And, you know, Norton was cordial.  You know, he signed everything for us and everything.  It was cool.  I hope he was cool as hell.  And, yeah.  And then me and Norton were talking. 
[01:09:30]  And, you know, I'll be sitting in the chair when you're taking pictures of him beating up people.  And I'm like, oh, I don't want to.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[01:10:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, boy.  I got to tell you.  Another funny story.  I love the funny stories.  Oh, boy.  I do remember the guy, too.  He came up and he told me that.  That's great.  That was funny.  As soon as he said we went to the stress factory, we had directions.  I'm like, oh, I know who this is.  He's a psychopath.  Oh, that's fantastic.  You know who he looked like?  Remember in Star Wars 3 when Vader's helmet came off? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  That's what he looked like.  He's a bald psycho.  That's terrific, though.  All right.  Well, anyone get to watch the Grammys last night?  Oh, no.  No?  I actually missed it.  I didn't watch the Grammys.  Saw some clips, though, thanks to us, Steve.  It was a lot of fun.  I think they did a pretty good job with it.  They did?  Definitely made it feel hipper and younger.  Who hosted?  Who did host?  Because I was just jumping in and out. 
[01:11:00]  I saw, like, Jamie Foxx singing some Ray Charles.  Oh, Jamie Foxx.  That was Jamie Foxx?  Jamie Foxx doing a little Ray Charles action.  Everybody had completed the transfer and actually become Ray Charles.  How long is this going to go on for?  How long is Jamie Foxx going to just be the Ray Charles everywhere he goes?  He really got into his role.  He might win an Oscar for that, eh?  Oh, I know.  It's awful.  I think he's going to win the Oscar.  You think?  Yeah, Ray dies.  They got the movie Ray.  Perfect timing.  I know.  The guy drops dead.  He played and did a good job. 
[01:11:30]  He's black.  They'll give it to DiCaprio.  You think?  Yeah.  They'll give it to someone else.  Racism in the Oscars, you think?  No.  Yes.  Oh, no.  They like all that stuff.  They like if you're black or if you're suffering from something.  Yeah.  Yeah, time.  Or play a part.  Right.  Or you're suffering from something.  Oh, Queen Latifah hosted?  Queen Latifah.  Really?  I'm right with her.  Was she being sassy?  I watched the Grammys off and on for an hour.  I didn't even see her once on the stage.  They had so many presenters.  There was no even need for a host.  The host doesn't really do much. 
[01:12:00]  You see how they're freaking out now about Chris Rock being the host of the Oscars?  Because he's been saying some controversial stuff.  Well, what did he say?  He said that only gays watch the Oscars?  Yeah.  Why did he say that?  He's been joking on stage.  He's probably on stage.  He's just joking.  The guy's a freaking comic.  Oh, so it wasn't a serious interview?  No, he was probably just being funny on stage saying, how many straight black men watched  the Oscars?  None.  You can't.  Oh, then it's funny.  Of course it's funny.  I thought he was being serious or something.  Veteran members of the Academy of Motion Picture and Arts and Sciences have grown concerned 
[01:12:30]  over the choice of Chris Rock as the host of this month's awards show.  Concerns deepened after Rock claimed only gays watched the Oscars.  Claimed.  He's a comic.  I never watch the Oscars.  Come on.  It's a fashion show, Rock recently declared.  What straight black man sits there and watches the Oscars?  Show me one.  Rock added, awards for art are fucking idiotic.  More.  Academy members have privately called for Chris Rock to be removed as host. 
[01:13:00]  Rock may be tarnishing the reputation of the Academy.  Simply put, this is a disgrace, one veteran Hollywood mogul, who asked not to be identified,  said.  This guy is out there saying awards for art are fucking idiotic and he's hosting the show  produced by the Academy.  You mean tarnish the reputation of the same organization that gave Art Carney best actor  for Harry and Tonto over Al Pacino in Godfather 2?  Wouldn't want to sully their reputation.  I mean, they've been so honest and forthright in the last 40 years. 
[01:13:30]  I think they thought Art was going to die soon.  God, he should have.  Hang on another 20, 30 years.  During a recent hate-filled rant, Rock imitated a White House press briefing saying,  Mr. President, what about gay marriage?  Fuck them faggots, Rock said of Bush.  What will Rock be wearing to the show?  And he's quoted as saying, nothing against people who aren't straight, but what straight  guy that you know cares?  Who the fuck, oh, who gives a fuck, Rock explained.  Well, yeah, because it's all come down to that. 
[01:14:00]  What are you wearing?  Who cares?  I don't care.  The only way I'd be, the only reason I'd be happy if they pulled Chris Rock off of this  is because Voss would probably lose his job as a writer.  I hope Voss wrote that joke.  I'm telling you, gays won't like it if you mention them.  That idiot, he's going to cost Chris Rock the Oscars gig.  Chris Rock doesn't need the Oscars.  But it's true, straight guys just don't care about what they're wearing.  Care less.  Yeah.  You know, and all these reporters that cover this crap, like, you know, during the pre-shows, 
[01:14:30]  they have nothing else to ask these people, so it's easy to go, hey, what are you wearing?  What are you wearing?  Who cares?  He's right.  Because they don't have a brain to ask the good questions, something that might be interesting.  Well, they don't want to offend.  It's all about the, you know, Hollywood honoring itself.  What award is Chris Rock going to win, by the way?  Chris Rock.  The most useless...  What did I call him?  Chrisco?  Chrisco.  Chrisco, whatever.  Chrisco.  What's his name?  Chrisco. 
[01:15:00]  Chrisco.  Sorry, I just saw Crockett walk into the studio.  Yeah, Noah, you know, I think Noah was kind of bummed that we didn't talk about him, I guess,  last week because he dressed relatively normal.  Yeah.  And so today he's wearing a very, very pink...  What does Sonny Crockett wear?  Very pink men's shirt.  It's manly, but it's pink.  It's pink, and he's got a white blazer over it, and he's wearing his sunglasses around inside  the studio.  It's not manly, by the way.  It's more manly if you take methamphetamines and catch super-aids. 
[01:15:30]  Super-aids.  Able to leave tall cocktails in a single bound.  Super-aids.  Look, up in the sky, it's a plane.  No, it's my spirit, because I'm dead.  I have super-aids.  You know, the Oscars just make me so nauseous.  I wonder if...  Sorry, I just had a thought.  I wonder if Ramon has the super-aids yet. 
[01:16:00]  Ramon, bring me my AZT.  Go ahead.  Back to the Oscars.  It's just so irritating, because Chris Rock is a great comic, man.  Hysterical.  He is a great...  He's the only interesting thing about that shitty cornball award show that they've had  in a long time.  Right.  And of course they want to remove him.  Well, you know who they could get in a pinch?  I'm sure Billy Crystal will come in and do his famous parodies of all the movies that 
[01:16:30]  are nominated.  No, he's on Broadway right now.  He can't.  When the adulation and accolades come in for him after every time he hosts those Oscars,  with the...  That's pretty brilliant, though.  The montage of...  It is the biggest hack act I've ever seen.  Aviator!  Aviator!  Oh, yeah.  He can come out wearing like a scarf and aviator goggles into some faggy Broadway show tune  as he skips across the stage. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, it's awful.  It's not funny.  It's not clever.  Oh, I'd rather see Jack Palance host it, and he's dead.  Wouldn't that be great?  Just cart out a dead Jack Palance.  You just open a casket, you see his rotting corpse, and just play audio.  How great would that be?  Oh, tip him out to do a one-arm push-up and the arm cracks off.  Do you know who was great as the host, though?  I thought Steve Martin was very funny as the host.  I really like him.  He's so dry and sarcastic. 
[01:17:30]  Is it dry and sarcastic, or has he just gotten to that point in his life where he's one of  those older comics that just...  I don't see him as being very relevant.  Like, Chris Rock is cool.  He's relevant.  Completely.  You know, if he's talking about current events, you know it's a take that somebody  that's in the now would have, you know?  You know, you get people like Billy Crystal and Steve Martin, their whole outlook on things  is from years ago, and they can't even relate to it anymore.  Chris Rock will not kiss their asses at all. 
[01:18:00]  He's one guy who will actually skewer the Oscars while he's doing it.  He did it at the MTV Awards.  He was great.  That's why he was so funny.  He's goofing on people that are sitting right in front of him.  Royalty.  Yeah.  This stupid Hollywood royalty, and he's ragging them.  You know, really, those jokes that, you know, that people know about, but no one ever  says to their face.  Sure.  That's what he's doing.  It's great.  Great stuff.  That's what makes it fun, too.  So, the Grammys, you didn't like Jamie Foxx coming out as Ray Charles?  I'm just tired of it.  Enough already.  The guy gets up and gives these frigging speeches. 
[01:18:30]  He's so self-important.  Great.  You did a fine job.  You did a great job.  It doesn't mean you go up there and accept an award and take 15 minutes thanking people.  Get off the stage.  He's selling himself, too.  That's why he came out and did the Ray Charles song last night at the Grammys.  He really wants to win this Oscar, obviously.  I guess he does.  So, want to listen to this a little bit?  A little taste?  Of him doing...  Yeah.  Jamie Foxx comes out pretty much like Ray Charles.  He was kind of acting like he was blind, it looked like.  Did he sing it, though? 
[01:19:00]  Was it a little...  He sang it.  It doesn't sound like Ray Charles at all.  It's his voice, but he's got a good voice.  You've got to give him props.  He sounds good.  Here he is with Alicia Keys.  For old friend.  Yeah.  For old friend.  That voice stinks.  The whole day through.  Get a great control.  Just like a nose-oing song. 
[01:19:30]  Believe me, I'm a noise, too.  Georgia on my mind.  My mind.  My mind.  Ooh.  I said, Georgia.  Ooh.  Almost freaked out.  Oh.  Georgia.  The song for you.  Sells is sweet and clear.  Alicia Keys, her awful body. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, she does have an awful body.  Alicia Keys, she has the hottest face.  She got up there to accept an award, and oh, my God.  She's shaped like a turtum.  She's as cute as a button in the face, but my God, is that body awful.  Ah!  Oh, Jesus.  Who is that?  Melissa Etheridge.  She scared the hell out of everyone, but it turns out, I mean, someone in the office  is like, figures she wants to look more like a dyke now.  It's like, no, she's got cancer, you idiot.  Does she? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Egypt requires the proper inflammation.  What does it look like from Star Trek I?  I was wondering why Nostradamus showed up at the office.  Oh, she's got kids.  She went through the chemo.  And she will buy a wig.  How about a hat?  I have the big C.  She kind of looks like the conehead without the cone.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, the conehead.  All right, anyway, there's whatever.  A little taste of Jamie Foxx.  I was annoyed that he could sing.  I was really hoping that he would go up there and try to do a Ray Charles song, and finally 
[01:21:00]  people would go, oh, enough of you.  It takes balls.  I mean, he's not known for singing at the Grammys to step up and do that in front of  a live audience, because they said no lip syncing at the Grammys, by the way.  No.  So he had to put himself out there, basically.  He did a good job.  He's got a really good voice, I think.  He did a great job.  I just think they should have gotten, and I like Jamie Foxx.  I want to see him win the Oscar.  I just think they should have gotten somebody.  You can have Alicia Keys, somebody that great.  You can have somebody great singing with her.  Old flower bag tits.  Alicia Keys.  Are they awful?  She really has an awful body.  It's horrendous. 
[01:21:30]  Her lower end is...  And she's a young lady, too, still.  So, I mean, she has really no excuses.  I mean...  You've got to chop that head off and put it on Beyonce's body or something.  Now, Beyonce has...  Her ass is way too big.  But in the hood?  Dude, come on.  That shit is fine.  She had a big dumper.  I never saw it.  It's not big, big.  She's just...  But it's ghetto.  Yeah, she's big.  Here, look at...  She's got big hips.  Here she is.  Oh, she's amazing.  Look at that awful body on her, though. 
[01:22:00]  No, look at that.  There's no real shape to it.  She's not bad.  You guys are...  No.  That dress was awful.  Yeah, but we can be picky.  Enough of Usher.  Anyway.  With him.  And then I guess...  Who's singing right now?  There's a guy with a guitar.  Who is he?  He keeps winning something.  John Moyer.  John Moyer.  What's he sing?  John Moyer?  Who is he?  He does a lot of pop rock.  Isn't that John Mayall?  He looks like Skippy from The Family Ties.  Skippy.  Whatever, Mark Price.  Ah!  Oh, sorry.  Melissa Etheridge again.  Oh.  My God. 
[01:22:30]  Watching TV here.  Which we like to do on a radio show.  That is it.  Occasionally we just turn and watch television.  Wait, you guys...  Someone said that if you burn Melissa Etheridge, she would look like Freddy Krueger.  That's exactly who she looks like.  Who wrote that?  Is that you?  You should have just said it.  Oh, that's awful.  That was Eric's.  Freddy Krueger.  That's funny.  Hey, Ben, what else about the Grammys?  Because I only saw, you know, a peak here, a peak there.  I thought the Across the Universe thing was pretty cool.  No, was that?  Yeah, it was good.  It was actually one of the better Grammys.  I can remember.  So, yeah, they had a bunch of people saying about the tsunami. 
[01:23:00]  Is Jack Palance still alive?  Yeah, he is.  I was going to ask you that.  I thought he recently died.  I never heard that he died.  Come on, he's got to be dead.  I wanted to question you on that, but I'm like, all right, I'll go with it.  I could swear I heard he died.  I'm sorry, Jack Palance.  Sheryl Crow was amazing.  Well, she just looked hot.  She didn't perform hot.  That's what I mean.  It was amazing.  Sheryl Crow.  And what was the whole thing with all of a sudden Leonard Skinner comes out and starts  playing Freebird?  What was that about?  Yeah, it was some chick, and then Dickie Betts came out. 
[01:23:30]  I started laughing.  He came out.  All I could think when Dickie Betts started playing Ramblin' Man, I'm like, man, we know  that guy beats his, well, allegedly, whatever.  Or that he beat the crap out of his wife or girlfriend.  Yeah, we heard tell.  What was the whole Freebird thing?  It was some tribute to Southern Rock.  I don't really know.  It was interesting.  That was weird.  That was a little weird to have Leonard Skinner.  It's like talking about irrelevant.  But it was good, Grammys.  What are the other highlights?  I'm trying to think.  He was born in 1919.  How is he still alive? 
[01:24:00]  Who?  You're obsessed with this.  I'm obsessed.  You're obsessed with your false information.  Purple Heart in World War II.  So 14.  He's 86 years old, I guess, huh?  86.  God bless him.  Yeah.  Oh, God, love him.  See, I was doing the math backwards.  It was a little trick I learned a long time ago.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good job.  Good job.  Thanks.  What you got to do is just take 100 minus whatever, minus 19, and then add five.  Right.  Vladimir Polanyuk.  What's his name?  Vladimir Polanyuk? 
[01:24:30]  Hey, how about that?  So across the universe, what was this song all about?  It was a Tsunami thing.  It was Bono, Steven Tyler.  Well, Velvet Revolver was on.  It was good.  Bono, it's got to be good.  No, it was Scott Weiland who's looking more and more like, who said it?  Like David Bowie.  He's like looking and acting like David Bowie.  Now, let me ask you, why is that an acceptable song to sing?  And I know that Rick's Tsunami song on 97 was mean-spirited, but why, this is, again,  back to the point of how comedians and comedy cannot address something, but musicians have 
[01:25:00]  carte blanche.  Why are they allowed to sing about it, and why are you not allowed to address the comedians?  It was a Beatles song, you idiot.  It was across the universe.  Harmless Beatles song.  No, no, no, but didn't they make it about the Tsunami?  Yeah, it was a tribute to the Tsunami, right?  How was it a tribute?  They just sang across the universe?  Well, what they're going to do is they made the song available, that version, on iTunes,  and then you download-  All the money will go to-  Oh, okay, I think you're saying they sang a song about the Tsunami.  No, they sang a Beatles song.  Oh, okay, okay, that's fun.  They had a really good cast. 
[01:25:30]  What are they going to write?  I don't know.  Swim, you bitches, swim?  Who knows, across the beach?  Maybe they could have just changed the words a little.  Across the beach.  That's a nice way to help the Tsunami victims.  Download on your iPod.  It's waterproof.  And then Steven Tyler was up there with his maracas.  Did he have the mic stand with the little 1981 stuff tied on it, those little gay best  scarves?  Oh, sure.  He'll lean the whole thing forward, and all the scars will flow, and Crystal will go,  Oh, Jesus, you're a faggot.  Shut up.  He's from Boston.  Yeah, he's great. 
[01:26:00]  No, Ozzy wasn't there.  Ozzy wouldn't be invited to sing with that cast, Jim.  He wouldn't at one point, a couple years ago, but that doesn't mean-  Look, I don't have anything that's Bono.  I know he's good.  I don't like you, too, but he's good.  I'm just sick of the same guys.  The only guys in rock they give any props to are Bono and Steven Tyler.  It's annoying.  That's the only representatives that they allow, and it's like Steven Tyler has done nothing  but sing ballads for the last 15 years.  I gotta say, though, the Grammys last night, it was younger.  Green Day performed, they were great.  Green Day's appearance was amazing.  Can we play a little of that later on in the show? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, we'll play that.  They did a great job.  Yeah, it seemed more like a VMAs-type vibe this year.  Yeah, it definitely felt hipper.  Anthony, Jack Palance might be dead.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike?  Yo, I'm telling you, Jack Palance is dead.  Well, I went to the Internet Movie Database, and they really know everything.  He's not dead.  And there's nothing about him dying on here, so...  I'm telling you, dead, dead, dead.  He's not dead, sir.  How do you know?  All right.  Yeah, how do you know?  Did you bury him? 
[01:27:00]  No, I just remember seeing it in the news.  I remember seeing a...  That's why I thought he was dead.  I swear, I...  He's not dead.  All right, well, Anthony, here it is, across the universe as we go to break.  All right.  Check it out from the Grammys last night.  A very good job, I thought, on this particular song.  Although Brian Wilson kind of wrecks it.  Is he kidding?  Oh, he sounds awful.  He's the only one that sounds awful.  Oh, he sounded awful.  Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup. 
[01:27:30]  They slither while they pass.  They slither way across the universe.  Beautiful ways of love.  Drifting through my open mind.  Co-dressing in with this for me.  Oh, nothing's gonna change my world. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Oh, images of broken light which stands before me like a million eyes. 
[01:28:30]  That call me on and on across the universe.  Watch me and look like a restless wind inside a letterbox.  They tumble blindly as they make the way across the universe.  The stars are broken in with this for me.  Take the deep dive in with this for me.  Oh, tears of broken light.  Nothing's gonna change my world. 
[01:29:00]  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  Sounds of laughter, shades of light  I'll find you through my open views  Inside and in my days 
[01:29:30]  Living this love, love  Shines around me like a million sun  It goes me on and on  Across the universe  I've been moving my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world 
[01:30:00]  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  All right now  All right now  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world 
[01:30:30]  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world 
[01:31:00]  Something's gonna change my world  You know that  Come on  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  You're listening to the swing sounds of Opie and Anthony 
[01:31:30]  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea  Close your eyes and drift away with O and A  Sick ass pop  Hi  This is great  You dick  Bye, I, I  Shut up, shut up  Fuck all y'all  Horrific and tasteless 
[01:32:00]  It's called sarcasm  I've never heard anything  As offensive and gross as you are  And that's why I'm signing up  The Opie and Anthony Show  I wrote a song  Mark has been my best friend for many years now  And I wrote a song  About one  To kind of  That's a lot of months  Years  I wrote a song to kind of celebrate what I think is our greatest asset as friends  And that's our complete and utter differences  We're total opposites when it comes to almost everything 
[01:32:30]  Completely  So I wrote a song  And we're gonna sing it for you now  Gay?  Not gay  Just one  One thing  One thing  It's his shirt, isn't it?  Alright, I'm the gay one  Whatever  Thank you  I didn't want to help you in front of everybody  I like my toast buttered  And I'll take mine dry

If you'd say  It's cool  It's not cool  I'd go pick her up  At her junior high school  Yeah, your sister  Wait, that sister?  I wanna fuck your sister  No!  I wanna fuck her in her fucking face  And if I could have all her fucking hair  No, hey  And if I could have her sticking in her eyeballs  Oh my God  You can't smoke off my sister

[01:34:30]  Can I have my stuff fixed at some point?  What are you talking about, Anthony?  Ah, my computer again  And no one come in here now, please  See, I bitched about it when we were down in Washington  When we sat in the tech meeting  Where we were told, you know, things like  Don't bitch about when something doesn't work  Because they get upset down there in Washington when we bitch  So they say, just tell us what's wrong 
[01:35:00]  And we'll get it fixed  It doesn't get fixed  I've been complaining about this fucking computer  For I don't know how long  And nothing got fixed  It's been months  I can't use this  Nothing works  All of a sudden, the screens will start scrolling  They'll start, like, skipping from one screen to another  From one browser to another  I open up, like, six at a time  So I can get, like, feedback and websites and stuff 
[01:35:30]  You go to go to another one  One flips up  The mouse still doesn't work  It's been months  You should just bring in your own laptop  And just set it up every day  I should  I really honestly should  Or we should just use our trios  Because it's not connected to anything  But you know something  What pisses me off is  They told us, don't bitch  Because it'll just make things worse  You're pissing off people down here in Washington  Pissing them off  How about fixing it?  I've bitched about this goddamn computer  How many times? 
[01:36:00]  A long time  Since I've been sitting here  Fix the computer  It's a computer  Grab one and plug it in  For God's sake  Jesus  What were you trying to find?  I know you were trying to find something  And then all of a sudden  I don't know  Windows started opening up like crazy  Oh, they started opening up out of nowhere  I don't even  You know what?  Honestly  I don't remember what I was looking for  I was looking for something  I don't remember  It's a little distracting  When 20 friggin' browsers  Start popping up in front of your face  Oh my God 
[01:36:30]  Just fix the goddamn thing  There, I'm done  God, we were having a pretty good show today  Computer diva  You brought the whole mood down  I bring nothing down  I don't bring nothing down  Now we're all kind of  Nope  Depressed a little bit now  We were all happy  Valentine's Day  Wish I had streamers and confetti to throw around  We're all feeling good  Singing along to across the universe  And now look  Nothing's gonna change my  Oh, that's what I looked up  Yes?

O.B. Anthony  And since it's Valentine's Day  Teddy Bear  Hi  I had my first porno experience 
[01:40:00]  My brother gave me a fat chick porno  And my dad caught me with it when I was like 12  And then he, like I thought I was in trouble  He took me into his room and he gave me a Playboy  He said, that's a real woman  And so, you know  I think it's a good thing he caught me  So he gave you the Playboy  And did you guys sit down and look at it together? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah  He was kind of pointing things out  He's like, you don't want fat chicks  That's kind of how he put it, you know  Alright, well thanks Jeremy  Thanks for wrecking this topic for the day  I really appreciate it  That wasn't a creepy story  Yeah, that was a whatever story  I love how  Thank you, Jeremy  I love how people try to help  Howard from Columbia, Pennsylvania  Sounds like your browser is too old to have pop-up blocking  You can upgrade Internet Explorer from 
[01:41:00]  Howard, you ass, ass  You think I don't know how pop-up blockers  Like I'm a computer fucking idiot over here, Howard  I know about pop-ups  It's not pop-ups that are annoying  I don't care  I don't care  I honestly don't care  I don't care  It's not pop-ups that are coming up, you idiot  It's not the pop-ups  The browsers  I have six of them open  They wrote  They switch from one to another 
[01:41:30]  I'll be looking at feedback  On the feedback one  And all of a sudden it'll switch to  CNN  And Drudge  And Yahoo  And Yahoo Mail  And all the other browsers  I have popped up  Don't forget chicks with dicks  Chicks with dicks  Oh, I didn't mean that one  Funny, Jim  He gives me a thing  Why don't you send me a thing  Telling me that my cup holder  Is actually a DVD-ROM  And the foot pedal is a mouse, you idiot  What a tool 
[01:42:00]  Sounds like you're browsing  Now it sounds like you're a dickbag  What an ass  Give me rookie friggin' computer instructions  Oh  Oh, that's funny  Unbelievable  Are you going to come back to the show?  Because we really have a lot of good things to do  I'm back  I'm back  Kind of  Well, you were good  Before you lost it with the whole browser thing  You were telling a very interesting hot story here  Hot?  What is wrong with these moms out there? 
[01:42:30]  That story's insane  Maybe we should say this for Mother's Day  This is a good Mother's Day story  Unfortunately  Well, it could be a Valentine's Day story too  Because it's sweet and full of love  Another woman trying to steal a fetus  That's what it looks like  I don't get this one  Yeah, this one's popping its ugly head up, isn't it?  A lot, right?  Yep  A woman stabbed to death  While possibly trying to steal a pregnant woman's fetus  Had been carrying an ultrasound picture of someone else's twins 
[01:43:00]  And wearing maternity clothes filled with padding  So she was faking a pregnancy?  Yeah  Obviously  And Alec Baldwin kicked her in the stomach  Oh, the cooler  How good was that movie?  You finally saw it  That was great  I loved the cooler  Police say 26-year-old Sarah Brady was nine months pregnant  Acting in self-defense Thursday  When she killed Catherine Smith  The attack happened after Smith called Brady  And asked her to come over and pick up a package  Supposedly delivered to her by mistake 
[01:43:30]  She was mentally disturbed  Said police  There's no question about it  Smith, 22, had been falsely telling neighbors for weeks  She was pregnant  And a search of her apartment after her death  Revealed a full baby nursery  How creepy is that?  Brady told police she was attacked  When she went into Smith's first floor apartment  To look at the woman's nursery  Police revealed details  Katie reached into her pocket  Pulled out the knife that was already open  Put it in an overhand thrust position 
[01:44:00]  And attacked her with it  Sarah was able to make it out into the hallway  But Katie reached out  Grabbed her by the hair  And pulled her back in  It appears that Brady struck Smith on the head  With an ashtray  Then grabbed the knife  Stabbing Smith three times  Including once in the upper chest  The money shot  Smith bled to death  And yeah  It seems like she was  Trying to do that old gag  Where you kill the mom  Cut the baby out  And then put it in the nursery 
[01:44:30]  And tell everybody  Because you've been faking  You're pregnant  Hey look  I had my baby  Meanwhile  You have a dead mother  In your apartment  That now you have to get rid of  Now they're not going to question  The neighbors  All of a sudden  You have a brand new baby  The mother's missing  Yeah  I mean  You've got to be crazy  And there's this cut open  Hulk of a woman  Dead in your foyer  She looks like the thing  In the Empire Strikes Back  That he kept  Luke Skywalker warming  Yeah  How do you explain that  Cut open the big animal 
[01:45:00]  And yeah  Oh  Yeah  People never think these things  You've got to watch A&E  Every so often  And get those crime things  And how they figure things out  That's a pretty easy one  To figure out  Someone married this lady  Right  Yeah  That is just creepy  A little creepy  But that seems to be  The new thing  People are  Crazy women are doing  And the woman did the right thing  How crazy is it  That she stabbed her to death  That's what has to happen  To someone like that  No trial  You just take a knife in the chest  And that's the end of it  Because if lawyers get a hold of that  All of a sudden  She's a poor woman 
[01:45:30]  That oh  She was mentally disturbed  You've got to let her out  And then a few years go by  People forget  And she's out on the street  What about the dude  That throws his baby out the car  Wasn't that a girl that did that  Or girl  Whatever  Was it a mother  Yeah she was 13  She threw her out the window  Because she was afraid  Her mother was going to hear her crying  Or something like that  No problem  No no  I'm just saying please  Better that  That on a plane  Stuck for nine hours  In a flight  I missed that story  I heard the one about the woman  That says she saw a baby  Being thrown out a window  Did you hear about that one  What there's two  Babies being thrown out 
[01:46:00]  The window stories  Woman's pregnant  She doesn't tell anybody  She's been pregnant  I guess she was a hefty woman  One of those cases where  No one knew she was pregnant  She has the baby  Knows that her mom  And family are going to be upset  With her having this baby  So she said  She was driving it  To the fire department  Going to leave it on the stoop there  And run off  Which is legal  I guess you could throw  Throw your baby to somebody  It was in Florida  This happened  Thank you Eric  That's a very important part  Of the story  In Florida  And she said  She made up this story 
[01:46:30]  She saw a couple  Arguing in a car  So she figured  She would say  That the car drove off  And a baby flew out the window  That the couple  Threw this baby out the window  She picks it up  She picks it up  It's her baby  And then she tells the police  Yeah I saw  This baby flew out the window  And her story  Got a little shaky  After a while  She said that she  Thought the story up  When she saw a couple  Arguing  Because then  She got witnesses  From the area  Saying yeah  I did see a couple  Arguing in a car  So it kind of  Corroborated her story  And it turns out 
[01:47:00]  That no baby  Flew out the window  It was her baby  It's alive though right  Yeah  Yeah that one's alive  Yeah because it didn't  Have a scratch on it  Because it never  Flew out the window  This woman just gave birth  And said someone  Had thrown it out the window  Interesting little story  Lovely  I like them better  She didn't think it's true  When a high school girl  Is throwing it in the garbage  In the bathroom  She didn't think it's true  She should have taken  Some grass  And smeared it  On the baby's face  Yeah to make it look like  Maybe it hit the ground  Or something  A skit mark or something  Yeah  You drag it on the pavement  With a soft baby butt  On the asphalt 
[01:47:30]  For a few yards  You just tie its feet  To the bumper  And drive it to the hospital  Jesus  What's wrong with you  Nothing  I'm not the one  Knocking chicks up  And tossing kids  Out the window  I think it's hilarious  Joe from Staten Island  What's up  Hey guys  I just called before  I'm sorry  It wasn't that funny  Of a story  But what I wanted  To get to was  I know  I do minor surgery  On myself  Yeah  What  Yeah I do minor  Like if I got like  A mole or something  On my chest

[01:54:00]  Maybe that was it then  And then he kind of just  Fell from there  Fell from there  He was really high up  And he slammed into  This rocky bottom  So he's dead  No  But he might as well be  I mean he  And he apparently  Thought he was  Because all you see  As he's crawling around  Because he's got  The cat on his head  Bloody hands right  Bloody hands  I saw that part  And blood on the rocks  And he's just crawling around  I'm usually  His point of view  I'm usually pretty good  I'm desensitized  To a lot of this video stuff 
[01:54:30]  This one really got me  Really  Yeah  I had to look away  The sounds he's making  Can only be made  By a guy  Whose chute failed  And it fell into the rocks  Or  A woman stomping grapes  That falls out of the thing  And hits the ground  Because I noticed  Some similarity in the sounds  Well  Alright  Why don't we play the audio  Of the guy  From the bass jump thing  The video is up on  Foulsburymusic.com  As we speak  Here's the audio of it  Ramone

Sounds like Super Aids is going to come from that exchange.  On the same CD Steve just gave me that has the bass jump audio, 
[02:01:00]  there's audio, all it says on this disc, it says,  Old woman describes rape.  What?  From some HBO special?  Oh, yeah, I heard about that.  No, I heard about it, though.  It's a whole documentary on some woman that was raped, some old woman.  Yeah.  But suppose the audio is a little, someone, I don't know, why don't we just play the audio?  I hear it's kind of interesting. 
[02:01:30]  All right.  After a rape, you go on breathing, you go through the motions of living, but your soul has been invaded and despoiled.  Hello, exactly.  To have on top of you a heavy, hairy, sweaty, stinking animal.  This is a giant cock.  To put your organ into your insides.  Who pushes and pulls and tears. 
[02:02:00]  Pushes and pulls and tears is the ultimate horror.  Okay, terrific.  Jesus.  The hell is that?  Oh.  There's a little more.  He got off of me, turned me around so that I was on my stomach,  pulled off my nightdress in four pieces, threw it on the floor,  and then he sodomized me.  And I thought, well, shucks, this is a new experience. 
[02:02:30]  Shucks?  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  She got raped and all she could say is shucks?  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  How old was she?  Oh, golly gee.  I'm big dick black.  Like 70 something, 76, I think.  Yeah, I heard about that.  She was interviewed and she told...  Obviously awful, but kind of creepy how she described it.  Was that supposed to be sexy? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, shucks.  Oh, shucks.  I'm taking the McKeister.  That is horrible.  That's harsh talk.  I'm going to hear Grandma getting railed.  We all know rape isn't funny, so let's relax.  No.  Yeah.  All right, it's Valentine's Day.  We're playing stuff in the brain.  Is that her?  Yes.  What?  Oh, she's awful.  What do you expect? 
[02:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Florence Holloway.  75.  Florence.  That's how old she was.  She had to tear off her nightdress.  She had to tear off her nightdress in four sections.  That's not a sexy teddy.  Let me take a look at her.  She's awful.  Whoa.  She's a square Frankenstein head.  My God, man.  She's in a wheelchair.  What is this HBO special?  It's just a documentary on an old lady that got raped? 
[02:04:00]  How awful.  Yeah.  Actually, it's been on for a couple months now.  Did they catch who did it?  25-year-old something.  It's cut off because the printer again.  I guess we hadn't discussed that enough times.  Yeah, we haven't talked about that enough.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's the first time we're bringing it up.  I think we have to talk about that another ten times, and that'll be taken care of, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, was she in the wheelchair before, or did he really give it to her good?  Oh, God.  All right, relax.  Let's play a song as we go to break, Anthony.  It's Valentine's Day. 
[02:04:30]  That's a good Valentine's Day story.  Playing some quirky songs.  Here's another one from Stephen Lynch.  You know how love begins, right, Anthony?  Of course.  You go out with your friend, and you look for chicks to bang, right?  There you go.  She got a smile.  Yeah, she got a smile.  And she's flashing it right at me.  She got a wink, a wink across the bar, and I know that it's meant to be. 
[02:05:00]  She got a walk.  Ooh, she walking over, and I know it could be my day.  She got a friend.  Ooh, she's got a friend.  While she's standing in her way.  It's a big fat friend.  Oh, God, there's always one.  Big fat friend.  To spoil my cooking fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby, if it's boots you want to knock, leave your chubbly friend at home, because she's going to block the car. 
[02:05:30]  Now, I'm afraid of no man, with any I'll contend, but I cannot compete with your big fat friend.  So, big fat friend, ah, we meet again.  You won't leave her alone. 
[02:06:00]  You'll roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments while you're sucking on that chicken bone.  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you, and your Achilles heel, and he's standing next to me, my non-discriminating friend.  So, what's that in your account?  Non-discriminating friend.  I'll nail you anyhow. 
[02:06:30]  I know that he's no looker, and he's had a couple rounds.  But with every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds.  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal, and your big fat friend.

[02:09:00]  It's everything, all the time.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Every rose has its own.  I'm listening to a favorite song playing on the radio. 
[02:09:30]  Well, the DJ said there's a game of easy coming, easy going.  But I wonder, does he know?  Has it ever been like this?  And I know that you would be here right now if I could have let you know somehow.  I get it.  Every rose has its own.  Everybody.

[02:10:30]  Remember Chuck Farnham?  Huh?  Oh, of course I do.  Hey, Chuck.  How are you, buddy?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you, Chuck?  I'm, you know, I'm okay.  Good morning.  It's been such a long time.  Yeah, I'm surprised that you're still alive.  You know, and it's strange because every time you guys get fired, I seem to be on that show.  You were on one of the last shows?  I was on the show in Boston, and then you were gone, and I was on the show in New York,  and then you were gone.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to try to keep this job for, I guess a total of three years wouldn't be bad. 
[02:11:00]  No, no, I think that works.  We're about four months in now, so, you know, we'll keep it for another, I don't know, two  and a half years or so.  Yeah.  So what have you been up to, Chuck?  You know, I took myself a regular job, sort of, kind of, and I've been hanging out with  a kid and trying to stay out of trouble and doing a pretty bad job on both of those  things.  When you're married now?  No, of course not.  Come on.  When you have a kid?  Yeah.  From one of the whores that you bang? 
[02:11:30]  You know, it could happen.  Was she a girlfriend or just one of these girls you knocked up?  Yeah, it was a girlfriend.  Yeah?  Well, I guess we wanted you on the show because it came up in conversation maybe about two  weeks ago now.  We were telling a story about the girl that liked to get her boobs punched.  Oh, yeah.  And we just wanted to, you know, talk about that, I guess, for a little while.  Sure.  Because we forgot all the details, but you find all these freaky chicks. 
[02:12:00]  There have been a few.  And as a matter of fact, the boop punching thing is relatively common, I've discovered.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, there have been more than one.  There's been more than one in your life?  Yeah.  I mean, there have been more than one since we discussed it.  Uh-huh.  They just kind of come out of nowhere and all of a sudden they just start, they don't like  to admit they like to have it done, but they do.  All right.  Could you, because we do have a pretty much, pretty much a brand new audience.  You want to walk us through the boop punching girl again?  All right. 
[02:12:30]  Basically, her thing is, she, you know, and you would think, you know, some girls like  to be fondled, touched, you know, pulled on, et cetera, et cetera.  She likes to ball up her fist and just go straight at them over and over and over again.  And she's not a young woman.  She was, like, in her mid-30s or early 40s.  Right.  And the more you did it, you could tell the more excited she got and the reality of the 
[02:13:00]  situation, because, you know, you start feeling really uncomfortable after you pop somebody  three or four times.  Yeah.  Or eight or nine times.  But how did you meet her?  How did I meet her?  Yeah.  Through a friend.  Who's your friend, Jake LaMotta?  Yeah.  I mean, you would think.  I don't think, and it's kind of funny, because when they, like, they bring, you know, you'll  say, hey, what would you like me to do?  You know, you're in the moment.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But this friend just, you know, casually comes up to you and goes, Chuck, I got a girl 
[02:13:30]  for you?  Yeah.  That's usually the problem.  And that usually means they already know that you're, you know, you're a freaky dude  and that they got the perfect chick for you type of thing?  Well, I think they know that I'm, I guess the word special comes up a lot.  Yeah.  How do you go from, you know, hooking up like a little blind date to punching her in the  tits?  Well, it's not that hard.  I mean, it's how you go through any of those situations.  It's like you're hanging out.  Next thing you know, you're messing around.  And then you're playing around and then I guess they start feeling comfortable and they 
[02:14:00]  say, hey, and they know you're a little, you know, I guess, affected as it were.  And then they go, you know, there's something I really like, but I have a hard time asking  you somebody to do it.  But you seem like you would maybe be okay with it.  You know, they don't want you to judge them.  Okay.  So then they go, I want you to, you know, could you just hit my boob?  And I'm like, you know, what?  You know, and I hit it.  And I'm like, so you slap it a couple of times, right?  They're like, no, no, no, really hard. 
[02:14:30]  Hit it really hard.  Use your fist.  So then you, you know, you start to try to do it once and you feel amazingly uncomfortable.  Of course.  Well, are you punching straight on or to the side?  Well, you kind of start to the side.  Are you like kind of taking a hook to it?  Like you're, you know, punching it to the side or?  Well, you're kind of popping in the side and then they're like, no, no, no, no, no.  Just hit it straight on.  In the nip?  Yeah.  And it's a large, you know, these are like your D size.  They're big. 
[02:15:00]  Now let me ask you a question.  When you're doing that, do you just do it or do you like ask her to complain about you being late or watching the game to kind of motivate you?  You start feeling uncomfortable.  That's the biggest problem with it.  And then, but you don't want to, you know, you don't, you don't want them to feel bad because you're, you know, because this is like not natural.  Yeah, but is she moaning through the process or is she saying harder, harder, harder?  Big time.  Big time.  And then I'm like, you know, I don't want to bruise you. 
[02:15:30]  I don't want to cause any, you know, tissue damage or anything.  And, you know, the word tissue damage when you're having sex is not the most erotic thing on earth.  Right.  And they go, no, no, no, no, no.  I like to look at the bruises the next day.  And then she used to call you up and as she's looking at the bruises in the mirror and then kind of, you know, tell you all about it.  And then, and then she would get turned on again.  She would start doing herself.  Yeah.  She would then now, she would masturbate.  See, you know, what he's saying is, dude, I actually dated a girl kind of like that who liked to be spanked that hard, like black and blue,  and would feel the bruises when she sat the next day. 
[02:16:00]  But it was only from open palms spanking.  Punching is like really kind of extreme.  Yeah, really.  It's really strange.  And then there was about, excuse me, about a year later, I'm with this other woman who's a friend,  and she knew the, the, the boob story thing, right?  Mm-hmm.  And we're sitting in a car in a parking lot at Denny's, and she goes, will you hit my boobs?  And I go, what do you mean?  And she goes, you know, like you did that girl, could you just, so I started smacking her.  She started moaning in the front seat of the car. 
[02:16:30]  Where do you meet these girls?  Jesus, really.  Maybe she had like, I don't know, like breast cancer or something, and you were like pulverizing it for her.  Well, that's a good way to give somebody some kind of weird medical problem.  Hey, look, after you've done with that, not for nothing, could you come over and hit my grandfather in the prostate?  You're right.  It's a new way to get rid of cancer.  Beat it up.  Right.  The tumor smasher.  That's so effing weird, bro.  It's pretty hot, though.  Yeah, like I said, it's not that unusual, apparently. 
[02:17:00]  All right, well, anything else freaky going on with you lately with the chicks?  No, I've been kind of mellow.  I got a raised junior, so it's been kind of light.  There has been one that's been a little weird, but she seems to have gone away.  And I've got to stay away from the younger ones.  Right.  They're troubling.  And I need somebody, you know, somebody who's, you know, over the 20s.  Really?  Yeah.  The 20-year-old's not so great.  No?  No.  All right.  Well, Chuck, thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Anything for you guys.  We just wanted a quick story there, because we were talking about it the other day, and  we were trying to remember all the details, but that's just messed up.  You know, somewhere around here, I've got a picture of her.  I should send it to you.  So, but you don't do that with her anymore?  I haven't seen her in a while.  Maybe, you know, maybe she's found somebody who really enjoys it.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe you should have checked yourself into a mental health clinic.  No doubt.  Yeah.  It's iconic.  Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you, gentlemen.  All right.  There he goes.  Chuck Farmer.  Wanting to be punched is just brutal. 
[02:18:00]  Isn't that weird?  Smacked is even acceptable to a certain degree, because it's submissive, but punched, that's  a violent crime.  I mean, I'm not knocking them.  I mean, I would do it, too, but...  But it would always start, like he said, he would just, you know, punch lightly, a little  jab, a little jab, and she would be like, no, harder, harder, harder.  That's weird.  What's wrong, Anthony?  I'm trying to use my computer for something, and of course, the Windows Media Player is so  old that it's not playing the video I want to see.  I'm trying to see if the, see the Allison Hannigan sex tape video that's sweeping the 
[02:18:30]  internet these days, but I don't think it's her.  It's not her.  Yeah, it's an imposter, is what I'm hearing from a lot of things, but I would like to see  it for myself, but...  I'm going to play stupid.  Who's Allison Hannigan?  Hannigan from Buffy and American Pie.  Oh, okay.  You know, band camp girl.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Oh, yeah, look at Big Cub gets a, oh, a redhead, ah, ah, give me a girl like Raggedy Ann,  ah. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, but this one has been all over the internet, but I don't think it's her.  She's given a BJ and taken one right on the chin.  See?  Whoosh.  But I can only see still pictures.  Because I can't see a video.  But the still pictures don't look like her?  No.  They, oh, see?  Uh, I would love to show you, but it just switched to an, oh, and then the, I, I, do you have a  virus, maybe?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, it just switched to the Drudge Report.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, maybe you should put some antivirus stuff on there and check it out.  That ought to fix it.  What'd you just hit?  I hit the computer.  And it turned off and turned back on.  Yeah, maybe now it's fixed.  I want this fixed!  God!  Can't they fix anything?  You know how important the computer is to this show?  Do you understand?  Something up to date?  I'm not looking for a mega machine in here. 
[02:20:00]  I just need something to get on the internet.  Do you know every, every, every jackass in the world has a computer at home that can get  them on the internet with, you know, nary a problem?  Why is there an issue here with this computer?  Why is it taking months and months and months and months and nothing?  Nothing.  They have to fix this.  What do I do?  I sit here, I make some asinine comments, and I check the computer.  This is half my job!  Half my job is broken! 
[02:20:30]  Half my job!  All right, a third.  I also, you know, I hit some buttons and make some funny sounds.  I get on mic, I call people jerk-offs, and I look at the internet.  And you're a good squeezer.  A third of my job.  But you squeeze, too.  What, this?  That goes hand-in-hand with the sound effects, though.  All right.  Unbelievable!  Well, let's see what's going on in the Drudge Report, because that just pops up. 
[02:21:00]  What's going on with Chris Rock and the Oscars?  I'm trying to go to paparazzifilf.com.  There you are.  And, oh yeah, how long will that stay on before it just switches to another browser?  God forbid I try to scroll down the page using the roller on the mouse.  It just, it doesn't work, and then switches browsers again.  I'm stunned.  All right, well.  I'm stunned it's taken this long to fix this.  And then I ask why this happens, and they go, oh, it's an old computer in there, is the problem, I think. 
[02:21:30]  It's not compatible with the mouse, and your Windows media player is old and stuff.  Okay, can you fix it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get on that.  Months, months, months!  Let's say hi to Brad.  Brad?  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, and A.  Hey, Anthony, you need to get rid of Internet Explorer.  Oh, another one of these hippies with Firefox.  They want everybody to go to Firefox.  I like Internet Explorer.  It works fine when it's updated and upgraded, and everything's in place, and it's on a newer computer. 
[02:22:00]  It works fine.  I have no problem with Internet Explorer.  It's not Explorer.  If I tried to put Firefox on this fucking computer, that wouldn't work either.  Trust me.  How come on Internet Explorer, Ant, you might know this.  Yes.  Like when I open a window, if I want to go to another page, like on AOL Explorer, I can open  a bunch of pages, but I can't put it in an Explorer.  If I open one, and I try to put the little dash to make it smaller, the whole Explorer window  closes.  Really?  I can only open one at a time once my Explorer's open.  That's odd.  Are you supposed to be able to do more? 
[02:22:30]  You can minimize it.  Yeah, sure.  Like this.  See?  Guys, let's try to move on here.  The Today Show is showing a very awful video right now.  It is Valentine's Day, so the Today Show thought it would be cool to have a couple get married  in a shark tank.  Oh, please, God, rip them to pieces.  When you do these wacky wedding things, it just proves to the world that you're a zero.  Look at her stupid veil.  It's sticking straight up.  It's floating. 
[02:23:00]  You are a zero with no personality.  It's our shark tank wedding, and then Friday, I saw a wedding on Fox, on their stupid morning  news show, where they were getting married at Dunkin' Donuts.  Not the fat couple.  Another couple?  A whole different couple was being married at Dunkin' Donuts, and the chick wasn't like  a pig.  But now this one, why do they keep showing these weddings?  Is it the Valentine's Day thing?  It would be a great wedding if they showed them getting married on a corner in New Orleans 
[02:23:30]  as black youths assault them and punch the groom in the face.  And grope and grab at his bride.  That is fantastic.  What would be better than that shark ripping a leg off?  What would be better?  Imagine just watching them being wed and seeing that leg with the perfectly tied sneaker on  it falling in front of her.  That's good.  You kids are right over there.  Over there. 
[02:24:00]  You kids are right over there.  There's no sharks in that area of the tank.  Yeah, they're in a shark tank.  The sharks are scared.  I guarantee some stupid lawyer for the Today Show is like, well, we'll do the shark tank  wedding, but there can't be any sharks actually in their area.  You've got to put the sharks away.  Which is probably some faggot nurse shark that does nothing but nuzzle you.  Yeah.  It'll cuddle.  There's divers all around him.  Oh, this is the dumbest wedding ever.  Oh, now they're holding up a sign.  Just married.  How are they hearing their vows? 
[02:24:30]  Two headphones or something they have.  Kill yourself.  Stupid reporters.  Kill yourself.  Here's the swimming with four-legged women.  Tie me a sheep shank.  You got soft hands, Mr. Hooper, from counting money on your life.  Couldn't need a bigger honeymoon suite.  I guess she was kind of hefty.  Oh, that's just a joke.  Look at Matt Lauer all, oh, look how nice this is. 
[02:25:00]  It's one of those segments that you know Matt Lauer's like, oh, do we have to do this?  God, I hope this helps our ratings.  Good morning, America's nipping at our heels.  This is what we'll do.  You think they'll be on the Tonight Show tonight now?  Ugh.  You got married in a shark tank.  Oh, big deal.  Stop it.  That veil floating straight up is ridiculous.  It looks like Don King hair.  Well, he should kink the hose on his bride right there. 
[02:25:30]  You know, they're interviewing them.  Are we running, maybe?  No, of course not.  No, they're talking to them.  I'm telling you right now, they're doing an interview.  Yeah, now it's an interview.  Got married in a shark tank.  See, Matt Lauer's asking the question.  Yep.  I want to hear...  We love sharks.  We'll have audio in a minute.  Oh, really?  We'll have audio in a minute.  It's done.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  I thought Ope was setting them up for the...  The big fall again?  The big fall, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Hey, why can't we just hook up the TV so we can get audio in...  If you want to watch us on the TV and get the audio,  you just hit a button and you get the audio from one of these two TVs  so we can just talk about it while it happens.  That would be just too easy.  Imagine being able to do something like that.  Why not?  I mean...  Oh, you're crazy.  Washington is all about complicating everything.  Now you're talking crazy, Jimmy.  Yeah.  How cool would it be to just push a button and just push the audio up?  Yeah.  We're not allowed to do that.  We're not allowed to do that for some reason.  What, for legal reasons or...?  I have no idea.  You're just crazy.  You are crazy.  Why don't we go to break, Anthony? 
[02:26:30]  We have Francine here.  She wants to do the news and a couple of our listeners  want to try out to be news people for the program.  We still have to talk about Corey Feldman,  his interview about Michael Jackson,  and also Jose Canseco.  Can we talk about this rabbi, too?  And the rabbi.  Oh, the rabbi.  Let's do the rabbi next.  Okay.  That's twisted.  But first, the Grammys last night,  you know, it was a lot of fun to watch,  and I thought Green Day did a great job.  You want to hear Quentin Tarantino,  first of all, introing Green Day? 
[02:27:00]  All right.  And then a little Green Day as we go to break?  Sure.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Quentin Tarantino.  Once upon a time, in certain neighborhoods,  calling somebody a punk might get your ass beat down.  But those days are long gone,  because in the 90s,  three punks from the Bay Area  popped into our lives in a big, loud way. 
[02:27:30]  Instead of fading away,  they've grown up releasing a concept album  with a very novel concept.  All the songs are good.  They're making punk rock history  with a real sense of purpose.  They're already winners tonight,  so you'd have to be a real American idiot  not to love Green Day! 
[02:28:00]  Don't want to be an American idiot  Don't want a nation under the new meaning  Can you hear the sound of hysteria?  The subliminal man,  come and cry  So don't you want to be kind of tension  Why cross the heat and shine?  Everything is at home  Till day and day  Now we share dreams of tomorrow 
[02:28:30]  We're not the ones from the footballer  But I think that's still a new fight  Well, maybe I'm a baguette of Nick  I'm not a part of a redneck agenda  Now everybody to the public end  They say no longer the age of paranoia 
[02:29:00]  The world is at home  The world is at home  The world is at home  The world is at home  The world is at home  Or I can't hear the end of the show  Everything is meant to be again  Tell me, talk to me, talk to my own  We're not the ones from the footballer  For the national one  You  Don't want a nation to lose 
[02:29:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:30:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:30:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:31:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  Ah, no, no.  The OPNM Show.  Comedy gone too far.  He shoots.  Pac-10 basketball.  It's the Pac-10 today.  Watch the bowls, man.  Watch the bowls.  Switch, switch, switch.  Get in his leg, get in his leg.  It's the Pac-10 today on XM Satellite Radio.  Today is Monday, February 14, 2005. 
[02:31:30]  I'm Scott Fleischer with the Pac-10 today.  Arizona head coach Luda Olsen continues to march towards John Wooden's record of 304 career Pac-10 wins.  Olsen just recently got the elusive number 300 in a victory over USC.  Now 304 is not that far off.  It's been quite a trip for Olsen from his North Dakota roots.  In 1952, Olsen led his Grand Fork Central High School team to a state championship.  After graduating from Augsburg College in Minnesota, Olsen began his coaching career at a high school in Minnesota. 
[02:32:00]  Olsen's first college coaching job came in 1969 at Long Beach City College.  After just two years at Long Beach City College, he led the school to the California State Juco College Championship in 71.  In 1974, the University of Iowa came calling and Olsen manned the sidelines for the Hawkeyes from 74 to 83.  Highlights of this stint included the Big Ten Championship in 1979 and a trip to the Final Four in 1980.  In 1983, Olsen's dominance of the Pac-10 began. 
[02:32:30]  Olsen joined the Wildcats as head coach and led them to a Pac-10 title just three years later.  In total, Arizona has won ten Pac-10 crowns during Olsen's tenure.  He has made four trips with the Wildcats to the Final Four and won one national title.  But it is not just Olsen's efforts on the basketball court that have gained him acclaim.  He has also made tremendous humanitarian efforts.  Olsen lost his wife, Bobbi, to ovarian cancer in 2001.  Since Bobbi's death, Olsen has been very involved with the Arizona Cancer Center.  In fact, this year, he and his family gave a $1 million donation. 
[02:33:00]  And that's the Pac-10 today on XM Satellite Radio.  The Ian Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Horrible choice for Valentine's Day.  Holy S.  This is sublime.  This is date rape.  Are you insane?  Let me tell you about a girl I know 
[02:33:30]  Had a drink about an hour ago  Sitting in the corner by herself  In a bar in downtown health  She heard a noise and she looked through the door  Inside, man, she never seen before  Light skin, light blue eyes  A double chin and a plastic smile  Well, girl had a race as he walked in the door  And took an empty seat next to her at the bar  A band who thought it was parked right outside  How'd you like to go for the ride?  And she said  Wait a minute  I have to think  He said 
[02:34:00]  That's fine  May I please buy you a drink?  One drink turned into three or four  And the best thing got into his car  And they drove away some place from far  Now, babe  The time has come  How'd you like to have a little fun?  And she said  If we could only take me on our way  I would not run  That's when things got out of control  She didn't want you  He had his face  She said  Let's go  He said  No way  Come on, babe  It's your lucky day 
[02:34:30]  Shut your mouth  We're gonna do it my way  Come on, baby  Don't be afraid  If it wasn't for date rape  I'd never get laid  All right  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program  All right  All right  Calm down  Yeah  Yeah  Mom  I love the Lord  I have to do this now  Mom  I hit the wrong one  Oh, well  All right  Well, we gotta get to the Jose Canseco audio  A lot of allegations 
[02:35:00]  Yes  I don't know who this is from  What is that?  Gee, guess  Well, it's Valentine's Day  And we just got a box of chocolates from Godiva  Wait, wait, wait  Are there two?  There's one  It says  Hey there  Wait, wait  It says  Opie and Anthony show  Oh, boy  Hey there  Happy Valentine's Day  From guess who?  From guess who?  Yeah  Who else works at Godiva?  She sent one box of chocolates over? 
[02:35:30]  Were we supposed to fight over it?  Well, we could just eat it  Open it up  Let's see what it is  Maybe it's good  That's a hefty box, too  That's a big one  That's a weighty box of candy  Oh  Chocolate covered strawberries  Wow  Get some plates  Look how big these strawberries are, man  They're mutants  I'll have one of these  Let's see one of those  Me too  Pass it around  That's nice  That's a nice gift from whoever sent that  Silver telephone  Or the gold telephone 
[02:36:00]  Pass it around  Very nice  Whoever sent that  Thank you  There you go, Jimmy  All right  These are like  Down syndrome strawberries  They're rude  They're fat, dumb, lunky ones  They're as big as your apples  They're ridiculously big  Look at that  There goes Jimmy  Pass them around  No, big cap  That's pretty good  Good, right?  Wow  Well, give me one, yo 
[02:36:30]  Oh, it's chocolatey  Now you've got to have one  Of course I've got to have one  Anthony, Jose Canseco  The steroid thing  Oh, my God  His book is coming out  It's really good, right?  Very chocolatey  I'll say  Wow  Good gift  Paddy actually  Came through on this one  I hope it's paddy  It's usually  We don't trust people  That just send open food like this  Probably that guy  Who wants to perform surgery 
[02:37:00]  On himself  Right  Great tumor on each one  Don't ruin it  We'll just eat on the air  Here people  Don't mind us  You're paying for it  We'll eat it  I'm three bites into this thing  And it's only half done  This strawberry  This thing is the biggest strawberry  I've ever eaten  Can I have a napkin, sweetie?  Yes, you can  For my little hands  Thanks, big cap  Wow  I'm biting mine 
[02:37:30]  Like a moyal bites  Of circumcision  Oh, yeah  We've got to talk about that  Yeah  It's a big story  Well, you're finished  So you start  Okay  Well  It seems  Any of the boys want some strawberries?  Come on  Oh, yeah  Look at them all coming in  Not Travis  He's new  You can have one  Danny, you're allowed to have one 
[02:38:00]  Come on in, Dan  Have a strawberry, son  Yeah, pass them around to the boys  See how big those things are  Thank you  I got one  Oh, my God  Look at that strawberry spider  It's bigger than your fucking head  Damn  Oh, you didn't look  Rockland County Health Commissioner  Has ordered a rabbi  To stop performing  Oral suction circumcisions  And to take a herpes test  I saw this story  It's got to be fake  No, it's not 
[02:38:30]  Rabbi Yitzhak Fisher  His old world method  Of performing circumcisions  Also has come under scrutiny  Of New York State  And Arndt County Health Department  The New York City Health Department  Said three infants  Circumcised  Circumcised by Fisher  Got herpes  And one died  Oy  Fisher uses his mouth 
[02:39:00]  To suction blood  From the wound  After he removes  The foreskin  Yes, people  You've heard that correctly  He removes the foreskin  Then puts his mouth  On the tiny little penis  And sucks the blood out  Can I interrupt  To take this moment  Of course  I have to officially apologize  For all the bad things  I've said about Palestinians  The ritual is used  Predominantly by Hasidic Jews 
[02:39:30]  Many rabbis said  Jewish law does not mandate  Mouth suction  Defenders contend  The spread of the disease  Is rare  And New York City  Health officials  Have prohibited Fisher  From performing circumcisions  And ordered him  To take a blood test  For herpes  Can I ask  Who's defending this?  Who is defending this?  People are so scared  Of offending somebody's religion  Especially Jews  Especially Hasidic Jews  That they will not  Come out and say 
[02:40:00]  Oh my God  You cannot do this  This is  This is ridiculous  I'm going to go out  On a limb here  Hey Jews  Quit sucking baby dicks  Or if you're going to do it  At least have the dignity  To wait until the blood  Is gone  Like the rest of us  Oh my God  How does that  Acceptable practice?  I mean you know  Catholic priests  Are all going  Dough  What a good idea  Yeah  If they would have  Thought it up  And written it  In some of their  Sacred scrolls  From years ago  Perhaps they could have  Done it  Well they do the same thing  They just continue  Cleaning the wound  Until the kid is 18 
[02:40:30]  Alright here's our  Little ritual for communion  Honol  Confirmation  Honol  Your wedding  Honol  Does that rabbi's wife  Actually have to kiss him  When he gets home  From work  I clipped four of them  Today  Come here  Foreskin breath  His breath smells like  Tears and little copper  Old baby powder  Copper breath  Having a bloody  Baby mule in your mouth  All morning 
[02:41:00]  Like a fine man of God  You think he tugs it  A little too  While he does it  And the kid's probably like  Could you tickle the bag  Your beard is uncomfortable  Mister  Poor baby  Your fucking  Foreskin is sliced off  And then this rotten  Old creep  Just leans in with his beard  Gotta get rid of the blood  It's gone rabbi  That is awful  And the kid doesn't know  Whether to cry  Or go for the money shot  What do the parents  Stand there 
[02:41:30]  And watch  Like all proud  That's a boy  I'll bet you the father  Elbows the mother  And go  Remember those days  How about it hon  Come on  How awful  That's really  That really goes on though  How is that  Acceptable behavior  It's gonna be like  Put a little piece of  Flesh freshen up  In your mouth  Whoa  What is the point of it  Justin on Long Island  Someone will help us  With that I guess  Yeah what's up boys  How you doing  What's up 
[02:42:00]  Alright so the thing is  This guy is famous  In the Jewish community  I was reading the Jewish paper  He actually will go around  Russia  And to all these  Like 30 and 40 year old  Russian men  That want to convert  I'll have to circumcise them  But he'll do the same shit  To them  So one of these assholes  Probably had herpes  He gave it to this guy  You're absolutely right  If that's what happened  The guy's a fag  Why don't we just  He's trying to blow people  He doesn't know how to do it  So he figures  Cut this off first  And that's fine  Yuck  And that's probably  This guy's doing it  To older Russian gentlemen 
[02:42:30]  That's probably why  He got the herp  He gave  Supposedly  Allegedly  Gave the herpes  To the babies  Ugh  Jesus  Yeah that practice  Has to stop  Juice  How is that not  Against the law  How is that not  Pedophilia  Yeah  I don't care why  You're doing it  You're doing it  Is he the only one  That does this though  Like it's just something  He came up with  You think like  He's the guy  I don't know  That's like his technique  His thing 
[02:43:00]  He's the guy  That does this  No one else  Dare try it  I'm a professional  And the baby's like  Little fat arms  Are moving  His little legs  Are kicking  And trying to get  That bearded thing  Off his little  Baby dinkle  Little fat legs  Kicking away  Confused  Let's go  Let's go  To Steve in Jersey 
[02:43:30]  Steve  Oh my god  You guys  Are making me sick  And I'll tell you why  Because  My son was circumcised  Many years ago  And my brother  Who was the  Godfather  Of my son  We hired this  He comes and he does  This circumcision thing  Right  And right at the last moment  He goes  He bends his head down  And we hear like  A slurping sound  And my brother and I  Look at each other  Like what did he just do  And then we were  Kind of like in a denial  Because we didn't want to think  Like he actually did  What we thought he did  And then I'm hearing this story  And I'm going  Oh my god 
[02:44:00]  This is what he did  Come on  Are you lying  Are you just trying to get on the radio  I swear  In fact  I never even realized  This was true  Until I just heard it on the radio  And like all these years  I've been in denial  About what I saw  What happened with my son  And now I'm like  Oh  This is unbelievable  I mean they really did  What they did  How old is he now  Your son  He was just  Bob Mitzvah  He's 13  Okay  Well that's what he did  He leaned over  And he gave it  A little slurperoo  I'm so freaked out  We need a sucking expert  To call in  And set us straight 
[02:44:30]  On this one  Because  I bet he doesn't even  Just suck the thing  He probably holds it  And he probably  You know  Just like licks a little bit  And kisses  Oh god  Jimmy  Maybe a little teasing first  That is horrible  Good thing he doesn't  Take care of black babies  You should hear  Well if anyone knows  Anything more on this  Please give us a call 
[02:45:00]  Alright  I don't know what the  Well they say  That most rabbis  Do this with their hand  Because you're supposed  To take blood from it  Is that what  I know nothing  About this practice  You're supposed to  Remove some of the blood  I guess  Collect some of it  And this guy  Uses his mouth  But  There you go  Alright  It's got him to stop  In other news  Jose Canseco  We got some audio  Of him on what 
[02:45:30]  Was it 2020  60 minutes  48 hours  Which one  They're all the same show  Supposedly he circumcised  Mark McGuire  And sucked the blood out  In his new book  Yeah well  He's got his  Steroid book  Coming out  Anthony  Yeah  He knew one of these guys  Would finally write about it  I mean everyone's been  Talking about the steroids  In  Especially Major League Baseball  For decades  He's saying  It was  He shot up  Steroids with a lot  Of these guys  Giambi 
[02:46:00]  Mark McGuire  To name a few  And he said  They would sit around  And talk about it  But it wasn't any big deal  Said it wasn't like  They were  You know  Doing crack  Or sitting there  Going you know  Wow I can't believe  We're doing these drugs  It was so  Commonplace  And so just nothing  That they didn't even  Think twice about it  It's just something  You did  There was no rule  Against it  Either  There's no testing  For it  So they did it  No big deal  Is what he's saying  And now all these critics  Are coming out saying  Canseco's lying 
[02:46:30]  Saying look at all the trouble  He's been in before  He's known as a liar  This is just another lie  Which makes me believe it more  Of course  People coming out  Really trying so hard  To deny this  Jose  We have audio  Yeah I'm just  Ira  Just backing up a second here  But I don't know  What she's trying to say  Ira from Long Island  Could she possibly be Jewish  Ira  Hey what's up guys  Oh it's a he  Hi Jimmy  Hi Ira 
[02:47:00]  Thanks for calling the program  Hi guys  Really think about this  The guy's Jewish  What's the one thing  About Jewish women  They don't do  That's right  That's right  That's put out  Punch it out  Sorry Anthony  Alright so  Jose Canseco  Had this to say  About the roid issue  Psychologists say  That steroid use  Can stimulate  Aggressive behavior  In some people  Behavior sometimes  Called roid rage 
[02:47:30]  Look at your own  Rap sheet  It's quite instructive  1989  Arrested in California  For carrying a loaded  Semi-automatic pistol  In his car  92  Charged with aggravated  Battery  For allegedly  Ramming his then wife  Esther's BMW  With his Porsche  1997  November  Arrested and jailed  For allegedly  Smacking his  Estranged bride  Of one year  November 13th  2001  Arrested with his 
[02:48:00]  Brother  After a fight  At a Miami Beach  Nightclub  On Halloween  Attacked two tourists  Leaving one  With a broken nose  And the other  With 20 stitches  In his lip  All of these  Are in the record  Are we to say  That any individual  Who's on steroids  That has an angry  Moment  Is due to steroids  What about the  Individual who gets  Angry and kills  Someone who's  Not on steroids  What do we  Blame it on now  Yeah I agree  With him  There you go  I mean 
[02:48:30]  Jose Canseco  That doesn't  Prove that he  Was on steroids  It just proves  He's an asshole  Right  That's what he's  Saying  Hey it wasn't  The roids  I'm just a dick  Right  I like the fact  He gave Esther's  Car a good  Ramming though  Pretty tired of  Yelling that awful  Name out in bed  Out of vehicle  I like the  Punch in the  Punch in his  Bride after a  Year of marriage  Good smack  To the face  That's great  She tried to  Embarrass him in the  Cobble by kissing  Tommy Cuomo  Oh yeah  Yep  Alright here 
[02:49:00]  Here's the  McGuire stuff  You write  Repeatedly  About injecting  Steroids and  Growth hormones  With and  Into  Mark McGuire  Tell me about  Your first  Hand experiences  With  McGuire  Steroids  Well it was  A moonlit night  Um  This is the  First time  Injecting him  In his buttocks  It was  But  It wasn't like  You gave a lot  Of thought  He injected  Mark McGuire 
[02:49:30]  In the buttocks  Two muscular men  Taking care of  Each other  Hey why don't you  Stick it in my ass  I'll prick you  And then you  Prick me  We gotta do it  In the ass  Though  Right  Why do you have  To do it in the ass  Maybe a rabbi  In the mix  To help things  Along nicely  Jesus  You take the  Back end  I'll take the  Front  Oh  They pricked  Each other  In the ass  In the buttocks  I gave it to him  In the ass  Then Mark McGuire  Went ow  That's smart  And came all  Over his shoes 
[02:50:00]  I gotta hear that again  You write repeatedly  About injecting steroids  And growth hormones  With and into  Mark McGuire  Tell me about your first  Hand experiences  With McGuire  Steroids  This is the first time  Injecting him  In his buttocks  It was  But  It wasn't like 
[02:50:30]  You gave a lot of thought  It was  It was something  So  So common  What we did  More times  Than I can count  Was go into  A bathroom stall  Together  Shoot up steroids  Wow  What the hell's  Going on  You will keep  Your hands  Off of my mule  Wow  Why do you have  To go into  A bathroom stall  Bathroom stall  Did you find  I don't know  A better place  That's something  That's right  After batting practice 
[02:51:00]  Right before the game  Mark and I  Would duck into  A stall of the men's room  Load up our syringes  And inject ourselves  I would often  Inject Mark  I injected him  Probably  Twice  But it wasn't like  I mean  We would just  Walk in  And a lot of times  They were pill form  A lot of times  You know  You were just  A quick injection  Of whatever  And that's it  I'm just repeating  What you say  In the book  If we're to believe 
[02:51:30]  What you say  In the book  Right  And I would often  Often  Not twice  Inject Mark  Well I think  It was more  Inject ourselves  I think I injected him  I mean this was  A long time ago  Once or twice  For sure  I didn't keep track  But  An athlete  An athlete  May prepare his needle  And may ask  Another athlete  To inject him  Quickly  I don't know about that  Wow  I think he got him  On that one  Yeah  Wallace got him  On that one  Wallace got him  He said often  And then he said  Once or twice 
[02:52:00]  Kind of nailed him  On that one  Mark McGuire  Must be sitting home  Watching television  With a beard in his hand  Just screaming  Every racial epithet  You can think of  On television  And he would beat him up  But now that he doesn't  Do steroids  He's a weakling  Wouldn't that be funny  Has him shoot him up  With steroids  And then turns around  And bashes him in the head  Gets a little roid rage  On him  I do believe  Ken Seiko though  I do think  It's just  There's too much  Most people  Wouldn't make that up  I went into a men's room  With a guy  And just shot him  In the hiney  With steroids 
[02:52:30]  Yeah you gotta  No one makes up  A story that hot  Yeah  Alright let's go  To the next clip  Tony La Russa  Three simple words  Three simple words  I am gay  Alright  Both McGuire  And Ken Seiko  Played under manager  Tony La Russa  In Oakland  Jose Ken Seiko  Says that he  And Mark McGuire  Used anabolic  Storage  A lot  When you were  Managing them  Back to the old  Hades 
[02:53:00]  True  I don't think  There's any doubt  That it's a fabrication  The product  Of our good play  And the size  And strength  That our players  Mark was a great  Example  What we saw  Was a lot of  Hard work  And hard work  Will produce  Strength gains  And size gains  Why do you think  That Ken Seiko  Says that  McGuire  Was using  August  First of all  I think  He's in dire  Straits  And needs  Money  I think  Secondly  I think 
[02:53:30]  There's a  Healthy case  Of envy  And jealousy  You know  He's delusional  These guys  Are using  Steroids  All you have to do  Is see the  Pictures of  Like a  Mark McGuire  When he first  Started in the league  And Barry Bonds  You ever see  Old pictures  Of Barry Bonds  How thin and  Skinny this guy  Was  They were working  Out a lot  Is what it was  That got him  Those huge arms  That could slam  A friggin ball  Out of the park  Like that  Sure  No chemicals  Big duties 
[02:54:00]  Jay  From Jersey  Is saying  Did Mark  McGuire  Say  Gosh  That's a  New experience  And I guess  Matt is  Wondering if  There was  Some kind  Of java log  In the  Bathroom store  And have  You seen  Mark McGuire  Since he  Retired  The guy  I mean  Some people  Say he's  Lost up to  80 pounds  Most of  These athletes  After they  Retire  They gain  A lot of  Weight  Because they're  Not working  Out anymore  Yeah  You know  But this  Guy went

[03:10:30]  it would be nice  if he could get hard again  so we can do it  Oh okay  But that might take  a little bit  That's why he was  asking for his blow job  and I said no  But he already came  Yeah  Well I wanted to come too  Yeah but your job  your joke's not accurate  Yeah  It's a little weird  A little weird  You're gonna have to  I don't know  You're gonna have to work on it  And then you say  you have  you know  the self esteem thing  and then you take  the shirt off  and people read the shirt  and laugh  That's what  that's what I thought  would happen  Oh  Okay  Alright well
