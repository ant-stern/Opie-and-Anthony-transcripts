<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from Washington, D.C. was a chaotic and technically disastrous affair.  The show began with a 15-minute delay due to security issues and an unfamiliar studio layout.  Opie, in particular, was enraged by the lack of control over the audio board, microphones, callers, and audio playback, leading to numerous on-air outbursts.  Sound engineers Steve and Jaime (who reportedly quit) struggled to manage the technical problems, which included echoes, delays, microphone malfunctions, and a microphone boom hitting Opie in the crotch.  A falling wall plaque became a running gag.  The hosts repeatedly criticized the station's management for the inadequate setup, emphasizing that their show's unique style required specific equipment not provided.  A guest, Bernie, stormed out after a technical issue, throwing a CD in frustration.  Staff members Ben, Jimmy, and Keith were present and contributed to the overall chaotic atmosphere.  The hosts also recounted a wild cab ride home with a driver, Sal (or Saul), characterized by reckless driving, and a drunken, explicit phone message from Pat O’Brien soliciting a threesome.


A significant portion of the broadcast focused on Jim Norton's negative experiences: a terrifyingly reckless cab ride with a cell-phone-using foreign driver (resulting in a lost hubcap), and a disastrous encounter with a Craigslist prostitute he described with offensive language as "atrocious," "a fatso," and "a big, black whale," whom he paid to leave after she displayed unusual shyness and requests.  They also discussed another caller's similarly disappointing encounter with a woman met online.  Technical difficulties with the phone lines prevented several callers from sharing their own stories.  The hosts also recounted their successful interview with Ozzy Osbourne the previous day, emphasizing Jim Norton's excitement and the acquisition of Osbourne's autograph.  The failing studio sign was also frequently noted.


Jim Norton detailed his disastrous encounter with a large, unattractive prostitute, focusing on the financial arrangement ($200, negotiated down to $150), his attempts to avoid legal trouble, and the reasons for abruptly ending the encounter, including his girlfriend's presence.  Radio host Mad Mexican and Bruce Kelly from the 80s channel were present in the studio.  News reporter Dee Dee, initially horrified by Norton's story, revealed kinky sexual preferences, leading to a playful, explicit exchange involving staged spanking while she delivered news reports, suggestive comments, role-playing scenarios, and discussions of various sexual practices.  Keith, a staff member, participated in the spanking.


Following Dee Dee's spanked news report, the hosts discussed spanking techniques and compared Dee Dee's crying to that of Walter Cronkite.  They planned to call Dee Dee's mother, pretending it was for a cooking segment, exploiting her mother's use of the term "sausage" for Polish sausage.  They also recounted being ignored by Gene Simmons in a Las Vegas casino bathroom.  A Washington Times photographer was present, prompting jokes about silly poses.  Bruce Kelly's uninvited interruption of a story about a hooker led to further frustration.  The call to Dee Dee's mother yielded discussion of Dee Dee's childhood discipline and sexually suggestive tangents.  The broadcast concluded with playing unedited, sexually explicit voicemail messages left by Pat O’Brien, discussing the messages' content, legal implications,  the possible recipient ("Betsy"), O’Brien's alleged intoxication, and a related Daily News article about his rehab entry. Dee Dee also provided news segments covering the Michael Jackson child molestation trial and the Terry Schiavo case, interspersed with the Pat O’Brien recordings throughout the show’s conclusion.

[00:03:00]  The Band of Heroes unites to fight the forces of evil. 
[00:03:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With Adam.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act, act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  That looks like curly spliced film.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Ever Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it's a sign.  Pauketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers. 
[00:04:00]  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just mixed.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  The audio is good.  Jimmy, how are you?  Nothing better?  Very good.  I'm styling.  You have a moron.  Guys, you're on. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, we're on?  Great to play.  Can you hear us?  Good morning.  Are we actually on, on, or just talking to you, on?  No, you're on, on.  Oh, that was a good cue.  Thanks.  Thanks for the cue, Eric.  What a great cue that just was.  We're just babbling like idiots.  It's silent in here.  We didn't hear any music.  No ecstasy of gold.  No, enough of this palaver.  Nothing.  And then all of a sudden, it's just, you're on.  Why weren't we being fed something?  Is Rage Against the Machine still playing, Eric? 
[00:05:30]  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  How come we can't hear it?  Wouldn't that be nice if we could have heard something?  Tommy just threw his headphones in the air.  He's pissed off.  He's all pissed.  Because the first thing that happens was a fuck-up.  I love it.  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  I love this.  What?  Are we still on?  That sounds fine.  Oh, it sounds fine.  Did Jaime just quit?  Jaime quit. 
[00:06:00]  He threw his headphones up in disgust.  And I would call that utter disgust.  Yeah.  And just walked out with, actually, I saw both hands grab his head and he walked out of the  control room.  But Jaime's a go-getter.  We like him a lot.  Because he has passion like we do.  You know, whatever.  And there's a short list of people that have passion like we do.  Let's just put it that way.  Passion.  Well, we're live from Washington, D.C.  Yes, we are.  In a studio that, I don't know.  It doesn't resemble last time we were here. 
[00:06:30]  It's just a table.  Yeah.  Opie's been neutered.  Opie has been neutered this trip to D.C.  Usually, Opie, very busy man, behind the board.  Anything you hear that goes out over the air is pretty much under Opie's control.  Microphones are little sound things.  Asshole!  Yeah.  Things like that.  Opie's controlling it.  They have completely stripped him of the ability to control the program.  You have no board in front of you.  No.  You have what amounts to a cutting board in front of you in a kitchen. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, because, once again, there's a lack of communications between us and, you know,  Washington, D.C.  Someone thought it would be a great idea to throw us in this studio and take me from behind  the board.  Yeah.  Which just proves that someone out there is not running the damn station and, you know,  should be fired at this point.  Well, you've been without the board before.  How long ago, would you say?  Never.  That's right.  Absolutely never.  Opie's never done the show. 
[00:07:30]  I can't think of one time.  So, way to be on top of it.  Maybe one quick phone call I would have been able to tell you what we needed.  One lousy phone call.  There is so much stuff that I do during the show that the average listener has no idea  about, and that's fine.  I don't care.  Subtleties.  I don't care, but it makes the show run smoother.  Yeah.  You know?  If there's a caller babbling and stuff, I pot that caller down.  And me or Jimmy or something want to make a point over the caller.  Right.  Opie knows.  Pulls the caller down so you don't hear him yelling and us trying to yell over him. 
[00:08:00]  And there's times that I've got to adjust everyone's, you know, mic volumes because  of things going on.  Just these stupid, tiny little things that make the show run, you know, much smoother.  But someone decided, ah.  Take him out of the mix.  Completely take me out of the mix.  Completely.  I can't just play, I can't play any of the news clips without going to Steve and it's  just dumb.  Steve is now in control.  And now we've got a delay in our headphones.  What is that about?  That's interesting.  There's some kind of delay I hear when I talk, all of a sudden it hears, I hear it 
[00:08:30]  kick him back.  You, Jimmy?  Yeah, but I feel good because I can hear the show twice.  I hear it live.  And then I hear the headphones a few seconds later.  We're getting the replay as it happens.  There you go.  Now it's gone.  It's fine.  Just a little echo.  A little echo never hurt, right?  Sure.  I'm not used to seeing little Opie's hands.  They're holding the pen.  They've got nothing to do over there.  They are just, he's going to be insane by the end of the show.  Yeah, it's going to be awful.  Because old Fidgety has nothing to do with his hands.  He'll just start figuring with buttons and like moving things around and adjusting everything 
[00:09:00]  and making it perfect.  Tapping things on and off.  Yeah.  We just need one person that is able to communicate with this radio show.  I mean, just to assume that this is going to be okay is ridiculous.  That was a little love.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  It's a leap of faith on someone's part.  Guess what?  There are times I throw two callers on at the same time.  Stop.  Now I have to tell Steve, Steve, go to one and then put caller three on bank two.  It's dumb. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, you have no control over callers either.  That's right.  I think I can answer them in here.  Oh, you can?  Ooh.  And actually, I probably could like control the phones at least.  Ah.  Ooh.  What's that scratchy, squeaky noise?  I'll have to move way up.  Oh, jeez.  Opie's mic.  The mic boom just went into his crotch.  Oh, my God.  Tighten her up. 
[00:10:00]  Tighten her up.  You'll never get that close.  I got it.  Stay away from me.  Prop it up with a two-by-four.  That looks good.  Everyone should really stay away from me today.  Oh, my God.  Just run, Ben.  Run for your life.  I was the cheerleader to, you know, get us all down here before vacation.  I was the go-getter.  Anthony couldn't be bothered.  Oh, could I not be bothered coming down here?  He wanted to just stay in New York and get ready for his vacation.  I don't blame him.  I thought it would be very important to come down here before vacation, get everything set, 
[00:10:30]  because we're coming off the premium April 2nd.  Yes, we are.  I'm not coming back down here again.  Is that it?  Yeah, I'm done.  We had to wait 15 minutes just to get into the building, because that wasn't set up right.  It's just incompetence all over the place.  It really is.  There's no reason Ant and I should be sitting in front of a security guy who has no idea who we are, which is fine,  and we have to sit there for 15 minutes, because there's no real setup to get us right in the building.  Yeah, that was interesting. 
[00:11:00]  Well, you know, unfortunately, they could blame it on us, because we didn't bring our little tags.  But the system should be a little better.  I remembered my little tag last time.  Yeah.  I forgot it this time, so we walk in, and the security guy at the front door, we say,  Hi, we're Opie and Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Denis.  Yeah, okay, this is going to be easy.  Yeah.  He had no clue who we were, what we were doing there, or anything.  He said, yeah, we work here.  We work in New York, but we're here broadcast. 
[00:11:30]  I might as well have been going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, because the guy had no clue what I was talking about.  Okay.  Like, I could have been, a guy walking in off the street asking if I could walk through the building.  Like, that's, and that's how he treated us.  Yeah.  Which is, you know, sit down, fill this out, put this sticker on, I'll call somebody.  And he's like, who's your contact here?  And Opie goes, Hugh Pinero!  I was thinking, I don't think the guy knows Hugh Pinero. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, he's a security guy.  He has no clue who.  A bone necklace, he has no idea who Hugh is.  I'm thinking if, I'm thinking if there's one guy that he would know, it had to be the top guy.  Absolutely not.  He had no clue who that was either.  Dude, you'd have been better off saying Mr. XM.  And then he's trying to explain another ridiculous corporate system, and I'm just pacing.  Yeah.  I am pacing back and forth like those panthers you see in the zoo.  Yeah.  So he goes, who's your contact?  And we go, okay, well, call Megan. 
[00:12:30]  So he doesn't call Megan.  He calls some guy that's supposed to call Megan to have her come and get us.  And then after a few more minutes, I'm like, who did you call?  He goes, oh, I called, and he gives me some acronym.  I have no idea what he said.  Was it?  Yeah.  Great.  So I said, well, is he going to call whoever needs to come down here to get us?  Because I think he probably said, okay, hung up, and when he gets to it, he'll get to it.  Meanwhile, we're going on the air soon, so I really need to get this taken care of. 
[00:13:00]  So he made another call to the guy.  It was just all of a sudden back to a lot of corporate stuff with calls and middlemen and intermediaries and stuff.  So it was a little difficult to get in today.  And that was just the beginning.  Now we sit here and Opie has no board.  I can't be way over here.  So where are you going?  Are you moving over a little more that way?  Oh, the keyboard when it slides. 
[00:13:30]  You have to slide it over a little bit more.  No, it's not in the right place.  Oh, stop it.  No, I just want it to be in the right place.  You heard that.  No, I didn't hear it.  It's funny.  It's like nails on a chalkboard.  Yeah.  All right.  So we're here in Washington, D.C.  I couldn't be more thrilled, so this is great.  You're digging it.  Mm-hmm.  I like the D.C.  I want to come down here more often.  Wait.  Let's go to the phones.  Let's see if these work at least.  All right.  Take a few calls.  Frank in Jersey.  Hey.  Good morning, gentlemen.  I didn't mean to drop any gasoline on the floor.  Wow.  There is an echo thing going on now that I can't even talk over. 
[00:14:00]  Can you hear me now?  Am I having an acid flashback?  Hey.  Hey.  No one hears that in Radio Land, though.  Well, it's gone.  They've got to deal with us hearing it.  Is it gone?  It's gone now.  All right, now it's gone.  We got the caller?  Frank.  Yeah.  Frank.  You guys are echoing.  Wait.  Can we take a call?  What?  Shut up.  Your mic's not on.  Ben's mic isn't on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no. 
[00:14:30]  He's going to kill somebody.  He is absolutely going to kill somebody.  Ben's mic is not on.  And if Ove had the board, click, that mic would have been on.  Seamless.  Hey, Cozy, I'd get that mic on.  All right.  Cozy Steve is going to have to.  Dude, you are.  No.  You know what?  I'm not even going to blame Steve.  No, I mean, he's in a situation now where he is going to have to chop chop.  But listen, Steve has to run all the stuff that I usually run. 
[00:15:00]  I swear, Steve, I will not blame you for anything today.  Because I know how ridiculous this is for you to try to read my mind.  Yeah, thank you.  I'm trying.  That was a simple thing.  Oh, Ben's coming in the studio.  Boop.  Yeah, you hit the button.  You're right.  You're right.  No, but it has nothing to do with you.  Do you understand that?  Yeah, no, I got you.  I'm just telling you that we're having two conversations going on in here.  So it's just so much more difficult.  I can hear the sweat on those Lebanese fingers already.  Oh, he's freaking out, man.  I don't just want to be cozy and be loved. 
[00:15:30]  This is just another example that this channel is running itself at this point.  It's running itself.  One phone call, I would have been able to say, you know, I just assumed, stupid me,  that it would look pretty much like it did last time we were down here.  Or something like we do every day in New York.  Not a completely different setup where you take me out of the mix.  Is that mic now on?  I don't know.  It's on now.  Sweetie turned it on.  What were you going to say, Ben?  Because I don't even remember.  They have to fix the, there's something wrong with the phones in New York that that delay  is happening, so Jaime's working on it.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we can't take phones yet? 
[00:16:00]  Not yet.  No, not yet.  Not yet.  Oh, bullshit, we can't hear that echo.  We heard at least two Anthonys talking in the background.  Oh, you did?  So it does go out over there.  All right, so then they can see some of the hell we're in right now.  Oh, cool.  And when all else is said and done, Opie's mic sounds like he's at the bottom of a well.  I don't know if that's, I think that's someone now, I think that it sounds okay out on the  monitor.  I think that someone might be a little messing with the mic, sounds funny. 
[00:16:30]  Because the levels actually, you know how the levels are perfect here.  Yeah.  All right.  Jeez.  Well, I'd love to know when we'll be able to take calls.  Is that a major problem, or is that a problem that can be solved within minutes?  Yeah?  I see phone calls being made in there.  Jaime's ready to kill somebody.  He's calling.  He's calling you.  We're trying to get it worked out.  Poor Cozy Steve.  No.  The pressure is now completely on Steve, even though, like, it's not his fault.  It's really not.  I won't get pissed at Steve at all. 
[00:17:00]  Because it just doesn't make sense on any level, if you understand the inner workings  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  I mean, you know, I think they made a corporate decision, because I was talking to Jaime,  that they're taking the boards out of all the talk studios down here, okay?  Well, that's great.  But you should be talking to the guys that are running these shows to see if that's going  to affect the show.  For the most part, on talk shows, a guest will come in, maybe during a commercial break.  He'll sit down at a mic.  Everyone will know that that mic has to be up by the time they rejoin the show. 
[00:17:30]  And then you talk to him.  But a show like this, someone's running into a microphone.  It's very hard to just pop the mic up for that guy if you're not in this situation.  As simple as this, probably Elo's listening right now, and these guys want us down here.  Yeah.  We're not coming back for this setup, because it just doesn't make sense.  Doesn't work for this show.  You're not going to take away something that I've been doing for close to 20 years, because  it makes sense for other shows.  Yeah.  This show is a unique beast. 
[00:18:00]  Every show is unique.  There might be other guys out there that need special things done in their studio.  Just to take all the boards out of every studio, because it makes sense to some gearhead out  there.  No.  And if someone was running this channel, they would be going to each show going, all right,  what are your needs when you come down to Washington?  You know, I notice, because I've spent so much time in New York, that you run your own  board, and you do a good job at that.  So I, as the guy running this channel, I notice that it's going to be different when you're 
[00:18:30]  in Washington.  Is that okay?  Nothing.  That's the conversation I would have.  Sure.  I should just run the channel.  I swear to God.  I should just take myself off the air.  I'll do a little something-something, and then I'll run the freaking channel.  You can't come off the air.  Actually, I can do both.  I can run this channel in my sleep.  That's what amazes me.  This is the easiest thing in the world.  You just communicate with the show and find out what their needs are.  Frank in Jersey, what's up?  Can you hear me now? 
[00:19:00]  Can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Yeah, can you hear us?  Your microphone sounds like shit, man.  Anthony's blasting through the radio, and then you, you can barely hear you.  It sounds like you're at the bottom of a well.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  That's what he wanted to say?  That was it.  Anthony in Oceanside, what's up?  You've got to be kidding me.  You've got to be kidding me.  I can't hear a word you're saying.  Not only that, Anthony's got the crazy radio DJ voice this morning, and so does Opie, and  it sucks, and fuck Washington. 
[00:19:30]  Ooh, keep it up, guys.  Ooh, punch down.  The crazy DJ voice?  Well, I don't think they've changed our voices, have they?  The mics are a little different.  Max in Dallas, what's up, Max?  Hi, boys.  God dang, I can hear you.  This is too cool.  Oh, he can actually hear us.  Opie, the reason you don't have a board is because you don't know how to run it.  Remember?  Didn't somebody already say that to you?  That was more of a joke. 
[00:20:00]  You have no idea what goes on on a regular basis.  I think there might be a weird delay thing going on on the phones here.  Really?  Are you catching that, where I think they're hearing us a little later than we think they're  hearing us?  Like, we're not hearing the delay, but it still exists.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, we say, hey, how you doing?  And then they chime in a little later.  I say, on the next call, we make a concerted effort to notice that, all of us.  Yeah, that's what I was going to do.  Are there any more phones?  Let's try this guy.  Doug out Doug.  All right.  Hey, Doug, what's up today? 
[00:20:30]  How do we sound on the phones?  Hi, Doug.  Oh, this is really bad, and I had a radio station ready for you guys, if you wanted to go to  that little bit this morning.  Wait, what's wrong with the phones, though?  You're a faithful listener of the program.  Yeah, right now, you guys sound like a really bad cell phone, cutting in and out, fading  in and out with the volume, and the callers sound like that over the radio, and while I'm  on the hold, you guys sound fine over the radio.  The callers sound like they're fading in and out of volume. 
[00:21:00]  Right now, you guys sound like you're in and out of volume over the phone.  Over the phone, we sound a little weird to you.  Yeah, you're fading in and out.  You're going up and down in volume.  And I sound like it on the radio right now.  Huh, interesting.  Well, there's a delay.  Yeah, I hear a little delay going to you.  Doug out Doug.  Say hi.  Hi, everybody.  I'm Doug.  See, there's the delay.  All right, well, we've got to take the phones out of the mix, too.  That's good.  That's really good for a talk show. 
[00:21:30]  Bye, Doug.  Thank you for playing along.  Thanks for that little experiment.  All right, well, technically, we're a disaster today.  Again.  Hopefully, we can make up for it with our creativity, some fun clips and hijinks that  I can't wait to see if we can even play, because that's going to be real interesting.  Yeah, we've got lots to do.  I hear we have Pat O'Brien audio that I have not heard yet, and I hear it's great.  It's amazing.  He's trying to get a girl to do a threesome, and that's why he went into rehab. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, he's in rehab.  He did one of those, what you call, phone calls, Opie, where he was completely smashed,  I guess, hammered.  Or that could just be the excuse.  Maybe he wasn't hammered and said, I better check into rehab and tell people I was drunk,  because that's the only excuse I have for this.  Called up some chick, was trying to convince her to get into a threesome with him and his  wife, and he's using profanities, and I guess this chick taped this, and now the tape is  out, and that's why he went into rehab.  Because for some reason, if you go into rehab, it gives you a clean slate. 
[00:22:30]  If he didn't go into rehab and this tape came out, he'd be screwed in trouble big time.  But you go into rehab, everyone goes, oh, well, he's in rehab.  Right.  Of course it's okay.  What?  Can you just deny it's him?  I mean, it might sound like it, but on the phone, it never sounds exactly the same.  No, you can't.  You really shouldn't deny it.  It just makes it worse, I think.  Well, no one should do it.  Maybe there's pictures.  Why don't we take a break, give these guys a few more minutes to make sure the bugs are,  you know, are fixed in this damn thing. 
[00:23:00]  Giving them a whole commercial break?  Well, can we play a song or something?  Eric, you got anything cool back at the home base there that you can play?  He'll play something.  Well, give us a lot of time, maybe they could pass something up.  Because no one wants to hear his bitch anymore, and I understand that, but it just amazes  us that there's just still problems.  It just amazes me.  If I was running the station, I would have been here at four in the morning to make sure,  you know, everything was set and ready to go.  I don't consider that bitching.  But that's stupid me. 
[00:23:30]  I consider that just talking about the situation at hand.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break.  We're going to play the Pat O'Brien audio.  We got to talk about the ride over here, Anthony.  Yes.  Got to talk about the train ride up.  Want to do the post-Ozzie interview stuff that our observations, it was really, really  cool.  The happiest boy in the world yesterday.  Anthony has a new movie theater experience.  Yes.  Also, we got Dee Dee in the house, Cricket. 
[00:24:00]  She's going to do the news today.  The Mad Mexican's going to stop on by.  We're going to talk to Sal, the cab driver from last night, who decided he wanted to  fishtail us all the way home.  Nice.  From Georgetown.  And lots going on in the news, obviously.  Sal, the cab driver?  Sal, the cab driver.  That was his name?  I thought he was, like, foreign.  I don't know.  His name was Sal, I guess.  So was Saul.  That's something awful.  It was Sal, Ben's saying.  Okay.  I thought we were turning into some wacky morning show where we have the cab driver. 
[00:24:30]  Keith, did you just say something?  I did say something.  Yeah, see, I can't control your mic.  Sorry.  What's that, Keith?  I said the cab driver's name was Saul.  Oh, there he is.  It's on, right?  Wasn't it on or no?  It's barely on.  I don't think it was.  I would have, you know, I would have...  Pot him up a little higher.  Pot him up a little higher, you know, but...  Keith isn't very, you know, on the mic.  You know, you're not a broadcaster, so it's, you know, maybe you'd have to turn your mic  up a little more, but, ah, who knows that?  Let me, uh, let's say hi to Peter.  I'm going to see if the phone's on.  Peter!  You're getting real deep, man.  In the old days, you used to flip out, break things. 
[00:25:00]  You're getting old, man.  I'm telling you.  You show up the edge.  I really am.  You know what the problem is?  There's nothing in front of him to break.  They've taken everything away.  You can't break granite.  You know what, Peter, the problem is, man, I mean, he comes in there to Washington, you  know, station, they weren't, they just dissed them all over the place, didn't ask them any  questions, what do you want?  If it was me and I had talent coming in there, first question, I have a question in your sheet,  what do you need?  Tell me your needs.  What do you want?  We'll take care of you.  You're a premium guy. 
[00:25:30]  I mean, I would have had to figure it out.  The guy that sort of runs the radio station, he called me around six o'clock last night  to ask if I was in Washington yet.  I'm like, oh, yeah, we're going to dinner.  Nice follow-up.  That was the first time I heard from him, you know, as far as this whole D.C. trip goes.  You know what, here's, Peter, Peter, Peter, here's the problem.  People are sick of me bitching and complaining and screaming.  I get that. 
[00:26:00]  But there's a point where it's fun for the radio show and it has its place.  But then it gets to a point where people are like, oh, God, another show where Opie's  losing his mind and Anthony's, you know, bitching, too.  They don't want to hear that after a while.  And we even acknowledge that.  And we talk to the gang down here in Washington.  We're like, look, we'll try to bitch less but get everything, you know, set up and set  up nice for us, you know?  That's why when we get back and we're off the premium, supposedly everything is going to  be running nice and smoothly.  We'll see.  It's going to be perfect when we get back to New York. 
[00:26:30]  But I understand people don't want to tune in every day hearing bitching and complaining.  But it just boggles the mind that we have these problems still.  Are they that stupid there?  They don't see that you guys run a very unique show?  And that you're the problem that needs to be talked to before you come down to a new venue  and say, you know, what are your needs and wants?  They just don't care about it, I don't think.  Oh, see?  Opie's trying to get a word in edgewise.  Well, I would have been able to...  And the delay, this guy keeps talking over Opie talking because he hears silence because 
[00:27:00]  there's a delay.  But see, what I would have done...  Pot him down.  I would have pot him down and talked over him.  But I don't have any controls over anything today because some idiot thought this was a  good idea.  No control.  See, here's the problem.  The person that is sort of running this channel, I think he's spread too thin, obviously.  Is that it?  And he has a lot of other things he has to worry about.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, let's take a little break.  Eric, is Eric going to talk to us back in New York at all? 
[00:27:30]  What?  We're going to do it here.  He's probably running around like crazy.  We're going to fire off all that other stuff from in here.  What do you got to play?  We got Bencho's Anthony's Martini Steve song, and then we'll do...  Well, see, that's what I want to know because then we...  Okay.  You set things up in radio.  Got you.  A little set up.  Just to play, it won't mean anything to somebody out there.  Gotcha.  Martini Steve, obviously, who's talking there, Anthony.  Yeah.  Likes his flame clothes.  Loves his flaming clothes. 
[00:28:00]  He's wearing one of his flame shirts today, and he's actually on fire in there.  Right.  Trying to work the board.  Right.  He's losing his mind in there.  And so you got with your brother.  Yep.  And you did a little song about Martini Steve.  A little song parody.  Back to my roots, Hopi.  You know, it's basically a play on the fact that he likes wearing a lot of things with  flames on it.  That's true.  Check this out.  Check this out. 
[00:28:30]  You know he's got some flaming shoes.  Martini Steve's clothes.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  He only buys flaming attire. 
[00:29:00]  His clothing's like a barbecue.  His laundry never needs a dryer.  If you're selling burning shoes.  If you're selling burning shoes.  This drunken Lebanese will fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  The only buys flaming attire.  You know he's got some flaming shoes 
[00:29:30]  The kind that Satan would desire  If you're with him drinking boots  The smoke detector is required  Martinez-Stee's clothes are on fire  Martinez-Stee's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  He only buys flaming attire  Martinez-Stee's clothes are on fire 
[00:30:00]  Martinez-Stee's clothes are on fire  Like sand through the hourglass  So is the O&A virus  Wow  You rule, Bernie  Bernie  No, no  This one, right? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, this arm  Oh, what are you?  Motherfucker!  Tony!  Tony!  Tony!  Tony!  Oh, he's coming over!  Oh, Bernie! Bernie, sit down!  Sit down!  Oh, my God!  Wait!  He's really mad  He's mad  You pissed off Bernie Gat  All right, get over there  It's getting hot in here  It's getting hot in here  It's getting real hot in here  Bernie, I don't have to take that  You don't have to take that, Bernie  All right, sit down 
[00:31:00]  It doesn't mean you're right, Bernie  Sit down, Bernie  Sit down  It's okay  It's okay, Paul  Oh, it's okay  It's okay  Oh, it's okay  Oh, it's okay  Oh, it's okay  All right, have Bernie sit down  Let's see  Everything's fine  Oh, it's all right.  Oh, yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you got to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, bro. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  I think him would take the CD out.  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep your CD.  I'm going to be here again.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  That was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it. 
[00:32:00]  He was out of his mind.  You know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man.  And when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman  and go, not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport.  Oh, yeah.  He's just like, ah, just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster and a little smoke filling up.  And he couldn't handle it.  Right.  Imagine that, though.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere. 
[00:32:30]  He just won.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You better.  Have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Stay fucking tuned. 
[00:33:00]  Because I'll come and fucking kill your baby's pet.  What makes bad kids bad?  What makes them do the things they do?  Ah, here it comes.  Live.  That's right.  From Cracktown, USA.  It's a joke.  Deep in the heart of Washington, D.C.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Both.  Drive safely.  Unquote.  Isn't that lovely?  Let's make a party out of it.  Right.  From the Anthony and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, don't give up on this radio show today.  How do I sound, Opie?  You sound great.  I sound good now?  Yeah.  Fix my mic?  Yeah, everything is good.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm just fucking.  Now Anthony's just being an asshole.  Oh, my God.  People panic.  What?  Oh, my God.  If you.  Wow.  Steve, you got to panic.  Wow.  Panic.  As you guys were enjoying that little song parody about Martini Steve, all hell just broke 
[00:34:00]  loose.  It's gone.  People are going insane in multiple states, Opie.  There was yelling going on.  And Elo comes in with coffee, hoping that it would be a nice morning for everybody.  Do not turn off this show today.  This is the one.  This is the one where it all goes horribly wrong.  Elo walked in here with a look on his face.  I can only imagine the similar look on JFK's face during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  He came walking in with his nice suit and everything. 
[00:34:30]  And the trouble on his face.  With his Terry Schiavo haircut.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  And the same look, I think, right?  His mouth agape.  Is he smiling or is he pissed?  I don't know.  Oh, that's horrible.  I was out getting my coffee and he had a little box of coffee.  He came in very nice, brings us a box of coffee.  Big Starbucks box of coffee.  And if he had it his way, he would put a few people into a coma. 
[00:35:00]  He just called me over.  I was out there.  He was, come here for a second.  And it's the first time I've ever really realized he could fire me.  I was really afraid of him.  I'm like, oh, this is what they deal with.  He wasn't mad at me.  He's like, what's going on?  And I was like, oh, phew.  So there was me.  Yeah.  So there was yelling and screaming.  And then Elo's coming in.  And Jaime is running around threatening to fire people.  And then he's making threats on the phone.  And then Ben comes in and goes that Eric is scared in New York and sounded like he was going to cry. 
[00:35:30]  It's serious.  Ben came in and he goes, dude, Eric sounds like he's going to cry.  Where is Ben?  Is he brave enough to say what he said to us during the commercials on the air?  It's Ben.  Ben is actually running around so much today.  His hair is perfectly neat.  Really?  Because he's running so much and it's offsetting the natural Anthony Mussiness.  We all went to dinner and we were just, Ben was talking about something.  And then we have no idea because we were just amazed at his hair.  Remember? 
[00:36:00]  We were all just like secretly staring at it.  He had at one point, you know, what would be anyone else's bangs sticking completely straight out.  It was awful.  He's talking and I look over at Ope and Ope is just staring at like the top of his skull.  It just went straight out like an awning.  And then I'm trying to get Jim's attention and then he's in on the gag and then Keith and then Ben knew that we were messing with him.  It was very, very funny.  So, where's Ben?  I don't know. 
[00:36:30]  He's looking for Jaime right now.  See, Ben's not brave enough to say what he said off mic, right?  No, I'm sure he's actually looking for Jaime.  That seems to be...  Where's Jaime?  He's probably in the floor somewhere.  Like there's hatches that you pull up.  This is like a submarine, this place.  There's hatches you pull up on the floor and crawl in.  You know that listener that called and was like, what's wrong with Ope?  In the old days you'd break stuff.  Yeah.  I don't need to break stuff anymore because other people are breaking stuff back in New York.  I'm here.  Apparently other people are breaking things.  We found out, I guess, that Mars, the guy back that helps us out in New York, Jaime had said something to him over the phone. 
[00:37:00]  I think a threat.  Went over the phone, a threat.  A threat about his job, I believe.  A threat about perhaps his job.  And as Ben was listening on the phone, he just heard a kaboom, he said.  He heard kaboom, and then the phones went dead.  Yeah.  Apparently Mars smashed the phone.  I guess it knocked the phones out.  I don't know if they're back working yet.  And then Ben hears Eric in the background.  It sounds like Eric is scared for his life and is ready to cry. 
[00:37:30]  And he's ready to cry.  And now Eric is rolling his eyes like, that's not true.  But that's what we're hearing, Eric, so I don't know.  Ben, there's Ben.  Come in here.  I'd be scared if Mars was on a rampage, like an eight-year karate expert.  Mars is a little psychopath.  Yeah, I wouldn't tango with him.  Dude, between him and Master Poe, we're scared for our lives every day in New York.  Well, Poe trains him.  That's how they know each other.  Yeah.  And between breaks, they're training each other.  They're kicking each other's ass.  What?  Are you talking about the stress factory until 3.30 in the morning?  Ben, so what happened?  I was just in engineering, so I just missed where you told him.  I'm trying to find...  No, what you were saying during break with Mars slamming... 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, Mars smashed the phone.  Eric sounded like he was going to cry.  It's another day at the office.  It's just difficult.  I'm just getting used to it.  You were on the phone.  The backdrop behind Ovi, it says Ovi and Anthony.  It's our big plaque.  Just halfway fell off the wall.  Just please leave it like that.  That's exactly how it should be.  One half of it just fell off the wall.  Just leave it like that.  This is...  This is just technical now.  I can't take it. 
[00:38:30]  It just shows you how important we really are to the company.  You know damn well...  It's sitting at a 45 degree angle.  You know damn well, just before we got here, it probably said Bob Edwards.  You know.  It just fell off the wall.  It's like...  It was Bob Edwards yesterday.  Like, oh no, but make them feel important.  Quickly.  You know, throw their poster board up behind them.  Yeah, throw it up there.  And it just falls off the wall.  The duct tape just...  Oh, it's that funny.  I just cannot wait.  When are we going to...  I say halfway through the show, we're going to be knee deep in water for some reason. 
[00:39:00]  Like the place is sinking.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, Jimmy's taking a picture of that.  That is classic.  It just fell off the wall.  All right, well...  Welcome.  All right, now that it's 740 on the East Coast, I guess we're ready to do a radio show finally, Anthony.  I don't know what's going on with the phones.  I have no idea.  Oh, God.  I have no idea, but here we are in D.C.  Yes.  Where do we begin?  Well, I've got to tell you, on the way down, we took the Xcella. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  I was on an earlier train than you guys, and I went right to the quiet car.  They have these quiet cars.  They're amazing.  Oh, you went to the snobby car.  You call it the snobby car?  Yeah, they're a little snobby in there.  I understand, though.  You know, you go in there, it's the silent car, because the rest of the train blows.  Hold on.  Yeah.  You're calling where I sat the snobby car, the quiet car.  Where were you sitting?  I was in the first class section of the Xcella.  First class.  Yeah, that's not snobby at all.  Which is also the silent car, because it's empty. 
[00:40:00]  Nobody else dares go into first class, because it's such a worthless place to be on a train.  Yeah, because you really don't get anything extra.  You don't really get anything else.  You get a meal that's slightly better than the concession food, or whatever they call it.  Yeah, slightly better.  And, you know, one thing I've noticed, you don't get kids up there.  Like, no one's going to pay for a stupid kid to be in there, so you don't get kids.  And I hate kids on trains and planes.  They just, bit, bit, bit, bit, yapping if they're that age, or crying if they're babies. 
[00:40:30]  So, eh, to not have to deal with that.  Why not?  I enjoyed first class at you.  I would love to have a conversation with you, Keith, but I can't control your microphone today.  Uh-oh.  Oh, poor Steve.  He is, to the stress and pressure that he is under.  Oh, he's not a mind reader.  I was just saying.  Yeah, it's, no.  Here, move to that mic.  No, dude, it's, Keith is too far away.  He's cranked all the way up right now.  Go ahead and talk.  I was just saying.  He's sucking the mic.  I was just saying how I enjoyed first class with Anthony yesterday. 
[00:41:00]  He was in first class with me, and then they kicked him out.  Yeah, Keith, the cop, decided to come down here with us, and because he's a cop, you  get to ride the trains for free, right?  There was a certain courtesy extended to me by the conductor of the train, and he was kind  of an old crotchety bastard, but when I went down, he was.  When I went down, I showed him my identification, and he pointed towards the front of the train.  Now, when we got there, Anthony went in that direction to the front. 
[00:41:30]  First class.  And everybody else went to the rear.  So I went to go with everybody else, because I know Anthony's going up to first class.  But the conductor pointed me to first class.  So I said, okay.  I walk all the way up with Anthony.  I sit down.  They give us the nice little nuts in the glass.  Oh, it was lovely.  In the glass, you know, whatever the hell it was.  Dude, are you panicking on telling your story?  Oh, he's having a nervous breakdown on the air.  Oh, really?  I know.  It's just that I have this, it's like a cock in my mouth almost, how close I have to be. 
[00:42:00]  I know, hard to contemplate without smiling.  To the microphone, I mean, I've got to be right on top of it.  Just waiting for that luscious surprise.  I know.  Normally, you're a couple inches away, and you can talk, but now, ah, ah.  You've been doing radio with us for many years, and I just noticed that you're just completely  panicking.  He's red.  You have no confidence in your story?  So, anyway.  It's a good story.  I walk up.  Now, I'm sitting there with Anthony in first class.  We have a nice little table.  I take the little napkin.  Keith, there's something wrong with that mic.  Go over there.  Oh, that's really going to throw him.  No, it's not a little idea. 
[00:42:30]  No, there's something wrong with that mic.  I'm telling you.  All right.  That mic now, Steve?  You're on it.  Nice.  Nice.  Are you saying a microphone makes your story awful?  Listen to the difference.  Is that better?  Okay.  Oh, this is much better.  Much better.  Now I can hear it.  So, we're sitting in first class.  I put the little napkin down on my lap.  We get the menu.  I order lunch.  They actually have menus up there in first class.  It's a train, though.  I text message Ben saying, I'm sorry, but I'm in first class, and we had some food that  I kept that we all had earlier on, and just as we're ordering lunch, the conductor comes 
[00:43:00]  up and goes, ticket, ticket, and I said, I talked to you outside, and he goes, well,  you can't sit in first class.  So, now I'm embarrassed, because now there's people looking at us.  Anthony's sitting there, and he's like, I said, well, I'm with him.  I wasn't going to help him out.  No, Anthony was.  I'm not getting thrown out of first class.  No, Anthony kind of just like, you know, pretending he was sleeping.  He closed his eyes.  He was reading the paper.  And he goes, that's my panic mode.  That's what I do. 
[00:43:30]  Let me see your ticket.  You're not supposed to be in first class.  So, I got thrown out of first class.  It made me take all my stuff, and yeah, they walked back.  They told him to leave, and it was right after he bragged to Ben on his text message that  he was in first class.  Did you have to go back to Ben and go, I got thrown out?  I had all my stuff, and I come walking back, and it looked like Felix Unger being thrown  out of his house.  That sign just fell even more. 
[00:44:00]  It's going to come off the wall.  Is this a barometer that's just, you know, trying to tell us that the show stinks so far?  When the sign hits the floor, it's time to just leave the show.  Who knows?  There you go.  Jim is taking pictures of it, of the progress of the sign as it falls.  To make an animation of it.  Are you done with that great story there, Keith?  No.  It was very exciting, yes.  Tell the point at the end.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's it.  No.  All right.  Well, you were in first class, Anthony.  I went to the quiet car to get some Zs, as they say. 
[00:44:30]  That's called the snobby car, yeah.  And, God, I love the silent car.  It's my people.  It's your people.  It's my people, I noticed.  And it's...  It's a car filled with uptight asses like myself.  Mm-hmm.  Uptight asses.  Yeah.  And as soon as someone...  You know, it is the quiet car, so you're supposed to do pretty much nothing.  Nothing.  You sit there and sleep.  You're not allowed to use cell phones.  You're not allowed to have loud conversations.  You don't even clear your throat.  You can't conduct business.  If you're just, you know, moving your luggage around in the luggage racks, too loud, someone 
[00:45:00]  will say something.  Yeah.  But the beauty is, like, I'm always on edge and ready to go, right?  So, some lady's on her cell phone.  I'm ready to pop up and say something, because I'm ready to, you know, crash, right?  Silent car.  Oh, dude.  Three people beat me to it.  I'm like, oh, this is awesome.  What do they say?  Oh, they're just rude as hell.  This is the quiet car.  Quiet car.  No cell phones.  On the quiet car.  Shh.  Shh.  You get shushes?  Oh, a lot of shh.  Quiet. 
[00:45:30]  It was quiet.  But the beauty of it is, you know, I was behind all these guys, you know, because I was ready  to get up, you know, and nope, I didn't have to do any of that.  The quiet car.  When you have to walk through it, you're all, like, ooh, tiptoey.  Got to be all quiet.  It's great, though, when you do a morning show and you're really tired after the show,  though.  It's perfect for us.  Go to sleep.  It's perfect for us, you know.  Did you talk on your cell phone once in a quiet car?  No, I turned it right off.  You did.  You turned it off.  I had, like, eight messages when I got to DC.  Because I know, I've been in a silent car before. 
[00:46:00]  I have.  I'll fest to that.  And I know that there are people that insist on using their goddamn cell phones and they'll  talk quiet.  Yeah.  We have to leave the village.  We have to go find some medications.  Very quiet.  Unless you always say what's on your mind.  This is the quiet car.  I can't act in the quiet car.  Yeah, and there are people that will try to talk in the quiet car.  Yeah, shush them. 
[00:46:30]  But a bunch of wimps, though.  I've got to point out this one thing.  Yeah.  Then there's a black guy that gets on in Philly.  Uh-huh.  If you've seen the pictures of, like, Britney Spears' old bodyguard, that behemoth of a  guy.  Yeah.  There's a guy like that that sits down in what could only be described as gang callers.  Jesus.  And he's on his cell phone pretty damn loud.  In the quiet car.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, where was anybody chiming in?  Hey, and I was one of them, too.  You didn't say anything. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, if you want to talk, I understand.  Oh, yeah.  The same...  It was an old guy, mostly, that was the leader of the quiet car, jumping up at every moment  he could.  Every little sound.  Man, this black guy was just, mother effer this and nigga this.  Oh, we are just such pussies, white people.  Oh, yeah, we are.  We're so frightened.  No one would have shut someone that big up, though.  And every time we do this break, there's a bunch of people that'll call and go, well,  I would have said something.  Yeah, right.  Whatever.  Sure.  And then finally, the ticket lady comes through and she shut them up because they were of 
[00:47:30]  the same color.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  There's a little bond going.  I bet he knew he was in the quiet car and just did it to be passive aggressive.  Of course.  Just to do it.  Of course.  And I wasn't going to say anything.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe I would have.  I would have told him to shut his fat mouth and get off the effing phone.  Now.  Cocksucker, it's quiet car.  So then I handle things.  So then, well, where do we go next? 
[00:48:00]  I mean, dinner was uneventful except for Ben's crazy hair and Sal, the cab driver.  And the nine of us sitting at that little awful table.  Fucking Ben recommends a place where they put like eight people at a two-person table.  Where'd you go?  Clyde's, it was called.  Clyde's in Georgetown.  Yeah.  The food was excellent.  It was fine, but I don't like my knees touching Keith on one side and Ben on the other.  I don't like other men's knees touching mine when I'm eating.  I don't like those restaurants that want to put you at that little goddamn table.  Anthony, it was a circular table that honestly could fit four people nice. 
[00:48:30]  Four.  Three really nice.  Three really nice.  And what do we have, five?  Five.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  They just want to cram as many people in here.  No, you're right.  Probably three tops.  Yeah, three tops.  Now that I think about it.  It's like a little cocktail table.  And then we see a bigger table right next to us.  Yeah.  That had room for six.  I'm like, this is perfect.  But the place, you know, I guess it's slamming all the time.  So they shoved nine people on that table.  Nine.  That figures.  Because I'm thinking, oh, we'll just move to the bigger table.  Like, no way.  Yeah.  Because it's just a very, very busy restaurant, I guess. 
[00:49:00]  So then we had enough and we'd jump in this station wagon.  I haven't seen a station wagon in so long.  I forgot that they even existed.  The family truckster.  A station wagon cab.  Yeah.  And there's three in front.  The driver, Ben, and who?  You?  Me, yeah.  In the front seat.  It was a station wagon.  Did it have that little backwards-facing seat in the back for Ben to sit there and wave  and try to get the truckers to honk their horn? 
[00:49:30]  When his hair is just right, he does look a little retarded.  When it's not combed, right, Ben's a perpetual child, too, isn't he?  Yeah.  Dude, he's just happy all the time.  Yeah.  Which is great.  I wish I could be as happy as he is.  He's one of the pressures on.  He's just, eh, well, that's how things go.  So then you had Sal, the cab driver.  You had Ben in the middle just messing with him, going, hey, can you drive us to the gay  section of D.C.?  Doing Mark Parental impressions to the cab driver. 
[00:50:00]  You got a PlayStation?  He was telling the cab driver on our way to Penn Station yesterday that we all worked  for the government, and we were on a secret mission to Washington, and Steve was a sniper.  Really, Steve?  And he's just telling this cab driver all this, and then he would, like, say, well,  that's all I could tell you.  And then he would, like, keep telling him more stuff.  He's twisted.  He loves just, like, I don't know if it's, like, some weird thing in his head where he  actually believes this stuff, but he feels he has to tell these embellished stories about 
[00:50:30]  who he is, what he does.  Gossip.  That's great.  Well, make even if it's fake.  Yeah.  He's got to gossip.  He's on the phone right now, just pacing back and forth.  God, he, you know how most people pace, like, five feet, maybe, just back and forth a little  bit.  In one spot.  Ben paces a hundred-yard haul.  The whole building.  It's just, like, back and forth, back and forth.  The one thing with Ben, you know, everyone knows by now, Norton does all these little,  you know, gags and stuff.  Ben loves those gags, but does them just really, really bad, you know? 
[00:51:00]  The worst at them.  Yeah.  But anyway, so it's Sal the cab driver, Ben, Norton in the front, then it's myself, Keith,  and Martini Steve in the back.  And this guy is rocking.  He's cranking the music.  He's on a cell phone.  I wish Ben was in here for this break.  He's busy.  Yeah, but see, it's taken away from the show because he has to deal with other stuff because  stuff wasn't set up.  See, he's waving Steve off.  We can't get him on the air right now.  Because Ben was just working the cab driver big time.  I wonder who he's talking to. 
[00:51:30]  I didn't say an ounce.  I said an eight ball.  So, it's not as good if Ben's not in here.  I will say, though, with Ben and that guy, my knees were pressed up against the front  on the dashboard.  I don't like to ride without a seatbelt at all.  It was a really uncomfortable cab ride.  You didn't have your seatbelt on?  No, I couldn't because Ben was there.  That's bad.  Fat baby legs all over the buckle.  Trying to get your belt both of these in.  Ben, I should have put them on my lap like they would have on a plane. 
[00:52:00]  Little kid.  Yeah.  Bubbles!  But Ben is just, you know, I wouldn't go past this huge hog.  You have to get an extension just to tie his cock off.  Like a tourniquet around that fat embarrassment he calls a penis.  But we notice the cabbie's just not right because he's talking on the cell phone and then Ben  makes him crank up the music.  And then all of a sudden, he just takes off, dude.  And my line, did he fishtail a couple times?  It was awful.  And, yeah, Norton and I are in the same boat when it comes to that stuff. 
[00:52:30]  Ben thinks it's the best ride he's ever had.  And I'm like, will you just stop right now?  I'll get out right now.  They think they're doing you a favor.  Yeah.  This must be how you guys drive because, you know, you're a little loud and fun.  It kind of brought me back to being a teenager in my early 20s where you have those friends  that will drink, smoke pot, do coke, and then want to go for a ride.  And you don't want to be the kid where you're the wimp kid.  So you go along with it.  I think you kind of talk about this in your act a little bit. 
[00:53:00]  And then you go along with it, and you're in the back seat, scared for your life, but  don't want to be the guy to speak up and go, why are you going 85 miles an hour on the  wrong side of the road?  I was that guy.  You were that guy?  I used to be the guy that would say something.  Oh, you used to say something?  Yeah.  No, no.  There were times growing up, like you said, that I would get in a car with somebody, a  friend or the friend of a friend kind of thing.  You're hanging out, and it's like, oh, I'll give you a ride.  And you have no idea how this person drives.  And the second he takes off, you go, oh, my God, he's one of these guys. 
[00:53:30]  And it's the drive fast, I mean, ridiculous fast, very reckless, passing over the double  yellow, things like that.  Passing over the double yellow up a hill so you don't even know if another car is coming?  Yeah.  And they're laughing and stuff.  And no, I was the guy that went, hey, asshole.  I go, excuse me, you want to kill yourself?  Do it when I'm not in the car.  Slow down.  Eh, pussy.  Yeah, I'm a pussy.  Slow down.  I was that guy.  I would say something.  I would always say something.  I hate it.  The nerves you would get the second you got in the car, and it would take off, and you 
[00:54:00]  realize you were in a car with one of these people, I'd be like, oh, no, one of these.  And then you never get in the car with them again.  Like, no, 10 miles, I'll walk.  That's okay.  I had a friend that basically got his license the day he turned 16.  And he was like 6'4".  He was buying us beer at 16 years old, because he looked like he was like 22.  He was the guy that had to shave during, you know, 6th period and all that.  The beard in high school.  Full beard.  Grizzly Adams beard in high school.  And he had a Volkswagen convertible that he would drive up onto sidewalks, onto people's 
[00:54:30]  lawns.  He would knock over mailboxes.  See, that's fun.  Because I could do that.  His car was a beater.  Because you don't do that at like 60 miles an hour, you know?  Yeah, but, you know, you're sitting on the back, and he just decides he wants to take  it off-road.  This is before off-road was cool, kids.  You know?  We live in the suburbs back on Long Island.  You don't go off-roading in Centerport.  Hey, you drive through the woods a little bit.  Why not? 
[00:55:00]  Sure.  So, it brought me back yesterday.  That's what I was thinking on the way to the hotel.  I'm like, what am I, 19 again?  Yeah.  And you start thinking like, ah, we only got a couple of miles to go.  You start counting down how close you are.  Yeah.  Say anything like that.  Oh, come on.  We're almost there.  Odds are we'll probably make it.  Yeah.  So, then there was this circle.  I guess it might have been DuPont Circle or something.  Was it DuPont Circle, maybe?  I believe it was.  It might have been about, it was about a mile or so from the hotel.  I'm not sure.  I know nothing of this city.  He took this turn.  He never slowed down.  And we felt the whole back of the freaking station wagon start fishtailing to the right. 
[00:55:30]  A little strip of paint on the guardrail.  And he's just laughing and hooting and hollering as we go.  Hubcaps came off the car.  Yeah.  Really?  One foot cap came off and flew into the side.  Hear it make that ringing noise.  I would have felt safer on the back of Christopher Reeve's horse.  It was an awful hairpin turn.  He's a foreigner on his cell phone and I never want to think about him again.  He's terrible.  Well, then he pulls in front of the hotel. 
[00:56:00]  He doesn't slow down slightly.  He just jams on the brakes.  Great.  And we skid to a stop.  Did you tip him?  Yeah.  That was the best part.  Yeah.  Because then all of a sudden he's like wacky cab guy.  All of a sudden he like jumps out of the cab like, ah, come on, you guys are home.  And he's laughing.  He looked like he could have been related to Ben now that I think about it.  He was in that same like, everything's cool.  He's opening up the doors.  There's cars stuck behind us.  You know, he don't care.  And he's thanking us all for the ride.  He doesn't know who we are, by the way.  I'm sure he does this with every ride he gets. 
[00:56:30]  And then Norton decides, you know, he gives him the $20 for the $13 fare.  For the fare.  But the guy's too busy on his cell phone thanking us, patting us on the back.  You know, we're getting his phone number to possibly get him on the show because he's such a whack job.  That all of a sudden you just said, what, keep the change?  Just keep it.  He was trying to keep talking so I wouldn't ask for my change.  Oh, so you wouldn't ask for change.  And it worked.  It certainly, because I asked him for change.  I'm like, just give me back five.  He's like, wow, what are you, like, you know, like he wanted more.  But he was kind of like being funny with it.  And then he kept talking.  And I'm like, just keep it. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, God damn, he totally got you.  Yeah, but it wasn't an intimidation thing.  He was just like a little twerp, but it was just like, ugh.  Do I want to wait for this animal to fish into his pockets?  Through disgust, he got you.  Wow.  I hope right now his car is a crumpled mess and his teeth are all over the beltway.  I hope that he smashed his face into the dashboard and little chiclet teeth just flew out.  Hey, Steve, what's Ben dealing with?  Because he's out of our show now.  Dealing with this situation.  I think he might be trying to get the cabbie on the phone. 
[00:57:30]  Either that or it's something else because I guess he shooed me away when I tried to get him.  So that usually means he's either yelling at somebody or being yelled at.  See.  See, if everything was set up nice, then we could have Ben on the...  See, it takes away from the whole process here.  The whole program.  The whole program.  And I'm looking at Opie and slowly watching the sign fall.  Yeah.  Have you noticed it's gone down a couple of inches on that side now?  Yeah.  Yeah, the right side just fell about three inches.  See, it's some kind of two-sided tape that's holding it up. 
[00:58:00]  And for some reason, it lets go and then it catches it again.  And the whole thing will fall completely before the show is over.  Yeah, don't touch it because we'll just laugh like idiots when it happens.  Yeah.  And you can enjoy it at home.  You might even hear it at home.  Yeah, Jimmy's taking another picture of it.  I'm taking photographs of the progress.  And then you can make an animation.  Yeah.  You put all the pictures together and watch it actually fall.  I'm sure someone in a whack bag will do it.  Maybe I can have my head bitten off in this one, too.  That was a great photo shot.  Let's go to Duke in Jersey. 
[00:58:30]  Duke, what's up?  You guys sound muffled today a little bit.  Duke.  Hey, Duke.  Big Duke 10.  Hey, it's Duke.  Duke.  Duke.  Yeah, so I go to California one year with my friend, and I'm a city boy and everything.  Duke.  How you doing, Duke?  Are the phones working, Steve?  They should be.  They told me they were, and you're up.  All right.  They should be.  Hey, Duke.  How you doing, Duke?  What's up, Duke?  All right.  I'm okay.  How you doing?  Morning, Duke.  You sound awful.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Sounds like your parents are funny.  Love your films, Duke.  It's too bad because we, you know, we want to take this conversation to the second level, 
[00:59:00]  as Elo calls it.  Second level, adding somebody else?  You go to the expert, and then you go to the phones.  We've pretty much done all we could do.  That we can't get to.  Well, maybe it's just Duke.  Maybe it's just Duke.  Duke sounds like an ass.  UConn.  UConn.  Hey, what?  UConn.  What's up, guys?  What is it?  Another college.  College is calling in?  You hear that?  UConn.  How you doing?  Temple Hill's on the phone.  Yeah.  Oh, UConn.  How are you?  Hey, I want to know where it is. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  All right.  See the delays.  I hear the delays.  I hear me go, how are you?  And then I hear, hey, how are you doing, guys?  I just want XM to know that we're holding up our end of the bargain.  We are?  Yeah.  We're giving a very entertaining radio.  Oh.  Yeah, it was some funny stuff the last time.  That part of the bargain.  But, you know, then we need the phones and everything else to work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That burns.  And now the guy that had a really good story is now gone because he can't just sit around  waiting for us to figure out what we're doing here. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, that delay is a...  Yeah, it seemed like it would have been a great story.  We brought back a memory for this guy.  Maybe I'll try to read his mind.  It said he wanted to talk about the time when he was younger that his friend wanted to take  him driving, his friend was drunk, and decided he needed to drive along a cliff.  Oh.  Can you imagine?  Yes, I can.  You know something?  I can almost relate to that.  But my dear departed dad, many years ago when I lived in California, would just get hammered. 
[01:00:30]  Get hammered.  And we would be out on something called the Ortega Highway.  This is a road that went between San Juan Capistrano and Lake Elsinore, California.  And it's a mountain pass.  And this road was the most dangerous road ever, ever, ever, ever.  Hairpin...  Hairpin turns, clips with no guardrail.  Well, two lanes.  One going one way, one going the other way.  Guy in the middle said, wait one for me. 
[01:01:00]  And just sheer clips.  And I would be in the truck, petrified, petrified, watching the tires.  Like every inch, the tire would go closer to the edge of the road.  The adrenaline would pump more, and I would just be in fear for my life.  And there's my father, just hammered, driving, you know.  And I'm in the passenger seat.  And the trip would take, you know, an hour and a half, two hours sometimes.  And it was just two hours of sheer hell and terror the whole time on this mountain road. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Maybe that's why I'm a nut.  Did your dad sprinkle that into my upbringing?  Did your dad have, you know, an open container?  Oh, yeah, a beer between the legs.  Yeah.  That's how all my uncles drove when we were growing up.  That's how I drove up until probably five years ago.  That's when drunk driving was a sport.  Oh, way back then?  It's just not a sport anymore.  They've taken that sport away from us.  My uncles would be just open beers at my grandma's beach house. 
[01:02:00]  And, you know, come on, kids, we'll get some ice cream.  And they're just, you know, pounding beers.  It's all about having beer.  As we're, you know, just tooling along 25A, no seatbelts, nothing.  There was a cement, I don't know, distribution plant off of this road also.  And you'd be driving.  And these huge, what they called Conrock, was the company?  Conrock trucks, cement mixers, would come just bolting up the other side.  And that was another thing.  Because the old man would move over a little to let the Conrock truck through and get closer to the cliff. 
[01:02:30]  I'm like, oh, my God, this is just petrifying me.  Petrified.  Very scary as a kid.  But always with the beer, yeah.  Always the beer between the legs.  It's slightly, well, I'm going to go off on a slight tangent.  Because when you just said that, it just brought back a horrific memory.  I lost my third grade teacher.  I think I was like in maybe fifth or sixth by this point. 
[01:03:00]  She went away for summer vacation or whatever, or maybe early spring vacation because it was still snowy where she went.  She went somewhere deep into Canada.  Deep into Canada.  And she never came back to school to teach.  Because her, her husband, and I think her friend were all decapitated by a snowplow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I forgot her name.  I'm like, wow, why isn't, what's her name back? 
[01:03:30]  That's terrific.  And why is there a young hot teacher in her place?  Well, I remember they had to sit us all down and tell us how she's not coming back.  And there was an accident in Canada that involved a snowplow.  And then I found out years later, oh yeah, it involved a snowplow.  Oh, they'll lose it in Canada.  Ugh.  Decapitated because the plow was up a little high and they got into some whacked out accident.  We had a kid die on that same highway I was talking about, the Ortega Highway. 
[01:04:00]  Him and his friends were tooling around up there.  And they went off the edge.  And one kid was thrown clear and lived.  The other kid, one of the kids that was in the back seat, flew out the hatchback.  But the hatch slammed shut on his arm right before he was thrown clear.  And he just rolled down the side of the cliff with his arm hanging onto the hatchback.  Like the car just bit him and dragged him down the cliff.  Ah! 
[01:04:30]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ah!  All right, relax, dude.  Like he almost made it out and the car just decided to poof, grab him.  Duke in Jersey.  Duke, what's up?  Yeah, so, as I was saying.  Hey, Duke, how you doing?  Oh, that was interesting.  What the hell was that?  Duke.  Oh, we needed a little promo.  Duke is where we were.  Yes.  Hey, Duke.  How's it going, guys?  How's it going, guys?  Good.  What's up, Duke?  So, Duke, is there a delay? 
[01:05:00]  A little bit.  No, a lot of bit.  All right, tell your story, Duke.  No, we can't.  Oh, is he gone?  We rarely have a nice phone topic, and we have one now today, and we can't go to the phones.  Another guy wants to talk about the Italian mountain roads.  They're the scariest.  Used to drive drunk.  Now I drive high.  Knocked out by the seatbelt.  Let's try to work with the delay.  Really?  Let's see.  Yeah.  Plunk one down.  All right, let's go back to Duke. 
[01:05:30]  We're going to have to think about this, though.  Who I think has his own problems, but we'll see.  Duke.  Yeah, good morning, boys.  Now listen to me.  We're on a delay, Duke.  We're on a really bad delay, so we're going to have to talk almost like walkie-talkie, okay?  I'm going to say over when I'm done, and you say over when you want me to talk, okay?  Over.  Over.  You've got to talk first, over.  I have nothing to say, over.  You're an ass, over.  Over and out. 
[01:06:00]  You guys look balls, over.  Over.  At least he's doing it in context.  See, this is how we're going to have to do the phones, Opie.  We're going to have to do it like KDK-12 to KDK-1, over.  Lonely Mrs. Torrance is trying to make conversation.  Can I acknowledge something?  Yes, Opie?  Here.  Over.  Over.  Something that we haven't discussed.  Imagine having to do the show like that, Opie.  Imagine?  Over.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, like that's far-fetched at this point.  Over.  Dude, yeah, Opie.  Crazy, nothing sane, Opie.  Over.  You guys do realize.  Motherfucker, Opie.  I don't know why I like flaming clothes.  Over.  Over.  Hi, Opie.  Over.  Over.  Over.  Over.  Over.  Over.  Over.  Over.  Over.  Hey, let me put my shemp wig on and go to work. 
[01:07:00]  Over.  Oh, wow.  Fuck.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do I have to say over?  Because I do have a very good observation.  All right, let her rip.  That'll throw me off a little bit.  No, over.  You guys realize we do work for XM Satellite Radio.  I think so, yeah.  The name, XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  Do you realize what it takes to get a satellite up into space?  Apparently, we thought it was a lot more than it really is because these people did it.  So they could get a satellite up into space, but we can't figure out a fucking cell phone.  A phone.  Or a phone in general.  A phone problem.  Yeah.  Actually, they launched satellites.  They launched satellites from the middle of what?  Like the Indian Ocean.  The ocean.  And everything has to be just perfect to launch the damn thing, but we can't figure out how 
[01:08:00]  to get phones to work on a talk show.  They got them up there.  They actually placed them exactly where they needed them to be in space, and they work.  The stuff goes up.  It comes back down.  Everyone hears what they got to hear.  But for some reason, we can't get the delay out of the phone.  It just amazes me.  It really is amazing.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Where's Ben?  Ben, just turn your mic on.  There we go.  Hi, Ben.  Hello.  Hey, Ben.  Ben's in the other studio.  Now, Ben. 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  We were talking about Sal, the cab driver.  Sal, the cab driver.  He's great.  Are we going to get him on the phone today?  Yeah, we can call him.  I'm sorry.  I had to go do something.  Do something?  It looked pretty intense, what you were doing.  Did that involve the program?  Yes, it involved the program.  Yeah.  They're not trying to blame you again, are they?  No, no, no.  All right, good.  We're over that part of the BS.  That's Ben.  We're all good.  That's what he is.  Yeah, Ben's not the scapegoat anymore.  Was he calling the hotel, asking him to have his overalls and butcher knife ready when  he gets back?  Oh, Chucky. 
[01:09:00]  Sorry, Jim.  I saw a Photoshop.  I saw a Photoshop on Wackbag of Ben as Chucky, and it was hysterical.  It was probably one of the funniest Photoshop I've ever seen.  I've actually been meaning to get the haircut.  Micah's going to get the haircut when we're on vacation.  Yeah.  I kind of like it.  It's been like three months, four months.  It's out of control.  It really is out of control.  It's very 70s.  It's you, man.  It's you.  It's groovy.  Groovy. 
[01:09:30]  So, what was your opinion on Sal, the cab driver?  It was fun.  Well, we were just being, Jim and I are in the front.  I'm in the middle between the guy.  The guy's going about 100.  We're driving through all the different areas.  We're just being jerks.  You're asking for the gay area.  We're just being silly.  The guy's on his cell phone.  You're telling him to crank the music.  He's fishtailing around corners.  You're like, XM Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio.  And, you know, it was, well, that wasn't even the fun cab ride was the first one where  the guy thought we worked for the government, the one that I took with Keith.  Who was in that one?  Keith and Anthony and Steve?  Oh, that was from Penn Station? 
[01:10:00]  We took, we made a turn, let's say, and it was a big deal to take this turn.  So, then the guy, I convinced the guy that we worked for the government and Steve was  a sniper.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We told all that, too.  Oh, okay.  I missed all that.  Right on.  That was a good one.  Why don't we take a break?  Is the cricket, Dee Dee, there ready to do the news?  Yeah, she's all dressed up and everything.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ooh, Jim, look.  All right.  We'll talk a little more after the break and then we'll get Dee Dee to do the news.  I guess, huh?  Yeah, let's do it.  All right.  Cool.  Get us out of here for a little bit.  I've got to take a leak, get some more coffee. 
[01:10:30]  I'll go with you.  Food.  Oh, great.  Two men.  Over.  Running in the bathroom.  Over.  Wow.  Just peeking.  Over.  Glory hole.  Over.  Tell me when you're going to come.  Over.  Ben, can we take a long break, kind of?  But keep it entertaining?  Like sand through the hourglass.  So is the O-A-Day virus.  I took this one girl to one of these really crappy hotels after the bar.  She was so hot, right?  Yeah.  I already, I banged her sister years ago. 
[01:11:00]  This one was the hot one.  So I take her to the hotel.  It was like, you know, 30 bucks or 40 bucks.  So we go within like two minutes in the room, three minutes.  I, you know, I finished.  I came.  It was just, I couldn't hold back.  So I called the front desk and I said, I saw a roach so I can get half my money back.  Because I don't want to spend a second to listen to night when I was going to get, I was going to get up again.  So I go, I just saw a roach.  So I got half the money back.  Can you tell, I'll tell the one about the other one.  Can you tell my favorite hotel story or the motel story? 
[01:11:30]  My favorite, I don't even care if the faithful listeners have heard it a million times.  It's great for the new ones.  Did you go to the, did you go to the front desk with a menorah and masa in your hand just to really push across that Jew point to yours?  Well, it's not a Jew thing.  It's a Jew thing, you cheap fuck.  No, but I'll spend, I'll drop money all over the place, but just certain, like, you know, I'll spend $500 on dinner for friends, but pick up golf tees the next day.  It's weird stuff.  You know, if you shoot alone in three minutes, you want some money back. 
[01:12:00]  You should win a prize.  Right?  It should be like, you know.  Tell the motel story where you picked up the girl.  I picked up this one girl after a show at Rascal South.  So we go, I go, let's go to the diner.  You always take them to the diner.  That's to, you know, get them alone first and to the car or whatever.  So we're outside the diner parking lot.  We're making out in the car.  She goes, I can't do this here.  It's a diner parking lot.  I go, okay.  So I pull next door into the car wash.  Right?  So she goes, I can't do it here.  So I go, okay, well, I know a nice place. 
[01:12:30]  Not a nice place.  It's just a little dumpy hotel.  And it was on the other side of the highway.  I drive there.  And it's like a crack hotel.  Right?  I mean, the place doesn't have a car in it.  It's like a total.  Yeah, the parking lot is completely empty.  Completely empty.  So we're in the car fooling around before I go in.  And she, you know, gives me a handjob.  And I come.  Right?  I have an orgasm.  So I'm thinking, well, you know, I'm not going to get a hotel room now.  Not now.  You're done.  So I go, hold on.  So I go, well, let me go in and get a room. 
[01:13:00]  So I walk in.  Right?  And I come back out.  And I look at her.  I go, they're all sold out.  And she said, there's no car.  I go, yeah, it's a crack hotel.  They don't have cars.  They don't drive.  They don't drive.  It's all sold out.  They've all walked up.  You're such a creep.  But I gave her my CD as a parting gift.  I do that to a lot of girls.  She wins.  Here, take a little piece of me home.  When you hate your life, just to confirm it.  I'm Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:13:30]  Live from Washington, D.C.  On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we are led to one conclusion.  This place just blows.  You're pretty harsh.  The European Anthony Show.  Wow.  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Well, she now.  Is she not right? 
[01:14:00]  Is she insane?  Well, she now.  I'm not like the machine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we're back with the European Anthony program, live from D.C.  at the XM Satellite Radio compound in the middle of the ghetto.  Had another interesting ride over here, by the way.  We had a nice car driver.  It was nice.  XM set us up nice.  We didn't drive over in the retard van.  We do talk about the nice stuff, too.  Once at a blue moon, when it happens. 
[01:14:30]  We had a nice town car with tinted windows.  Oh, yeah.  Making us feel very important, Anthony.  Was that because we were just ragging on the fact that they usually pick us up in the retard van with our cartoon faces on the side?  I have no idea.  Feels a little odd.  We were ragging about that last week.  I have a feeling that the European Anthony van has been painted over, and they don't want to tell us.  Yeah.  So they're like, look, we'll make it look really good.  We'll pick them up in a nice town car, tinted windows, and that'll distract them so they don't see Major League Baseball now on XM Satellite Radio all over this van that used to have our faces. 
[01:15:00]  Look out the window.  That was nice.  The Bob Edwards van driving around boring people on the road.  NPR.  Can I say, I listened to that on the way in.  NPR, it is atrocious radio.  How did anybody listen to that?  It is horrible.  I take a cab every morning in New York to the station, right? 
[01:15:30]  That's a quick cab ride.  Every, whoa, what happened there?  Every cab driver listens to NPR.  Yeah.  They can barely speak English, but they're getting informed by listening to NPR.  These savages, they're picking up like one word here and there.  They think they know American politics.  They nod occasionally at the wrong places.  It's a commercial, you monkey.  What are you nodding at?  Oh, it's terrible, boring radio.  It's just dry and mildly informative.  What's the most overrated radio in the country is NPR?  It's like a bad, never-ending newscast that just goes on and on. 
[01:16:00]  I was praying for a news ticker sound in the back.  Yes.  This is NPR.  Oh, you fucking dead person with a microphone.  It was awful.  Our guest today is the senator from Arizona who will be discussing the...  Oh!  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  You want to hear the senator?  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  It was unlistenably bad.  I couldn't get over that this is what everybody raves about is this informative radio. 
[01:16:30]  It just stinks.  They all listen to it.  Yeah.  So I was thinking on the way over, we're in this town car with the tinted windows.  Yeah.  The tinted windows were there, so people couldn't get a good shot at us, I'm thinking.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, because then the...  Can I take a pot shot through the window?  Oh, the driver, he's got this new GPS.  Yeah.  He had this new portable GPS system that he was bragging about.  He's like, I'm going to try it for the first time.  Yeah, great.  Well, the...  Test it out on your way driving us to work. 
[01:17:00]  If GPS, you know, the company that makes the GPSes want to make a lot of money, they  should have a feature on those things where you avoid the ghetto.  Oh, you mean like a red zone, hot zone?  Yeah, because the GPS doesn't know that they're going to take you the shortest way from the  hotel to the XM compound, right?  But the GPS has no idea that they're going to send you right through the ghetto.  Yeah.  This guy was making laps and rights through the ghetto.  There's burnt out cars.  There's cars in the middle of the road just idling.  Yeah, it gives you the fastest route, but perhaps the fastest route is not the safest route. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  They should have a shwuggy feature.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a GPS should be for it.  Get past shwuggies.  Oh, I don't even have my bell.  How can we do radio like this when I don't have my bell?  Ding, ding.  Jesus.  Well, think about it, though.  Yeah, well.  Whitey wants to go from point A to point B, but they don't want to have to go through  shwuggyville to get there.  Right.  Well, I was a little worried at one point.  We're going through the projects, and there was somebody parked in the road with just left 
[01:18:00]  barely enough room for the car to squeak through.  And that's a danger because you really have to slow down, and people can jump out and do  things, maybe carjack you or something.  They kind of do that on purpose sometimes.  Right.  They make it so you have to slow down so they could get to you.  You can't speed off.  And that was a little frightening because I looked at the guy sitting in the car in the  road, and he wasn't there picking up someone for an office job early in the morning. 
[01:18:30]  Believe me.  He was up to no good.  So I even said to the driver jokingly, like, well, usually we'd beep and yell and scream,  but let's not do that today.  To the drug dealer, you said.  And he goes, oh, you're right.  You're right.  He goes, you're right.  Do you know where we're at?  I'm like, no.  He goes, that's exactly what's going on in this neighborhood.  I'm like, great.  He goes, that XM, they got a great deal on that compound, but it's in the middle of the  ghetto.  Yeah.  Yeah, we understand that.  Fortress XM.  My guy was a little African gentleman who was a pretty aggressive driver, but we had 
[01:19:00]  a thing where there was a slow minivan in front of us, and it was on the block where  there was 40 young enterprising youths standing outside.  I imagine they're waiting for a school bus, and he's honking at the person in front of us,  and there's nowhere to go around.  Oh, no.  And I'm thinking, don't honk.  Don't honk.  Because if the person stops and gets out to confront you, we have no options unless  this car has a raise up and go over the car in front of it feature.  Which I doubt it did.  I'm not saying that those enterprising young gentlemen weren't out there doing good. 
[01:19:30]  Sure.  Maybe they were with the public work systems and waiting to get picked up for their jobs.  Could have been.  You don't know.  They could have been Adopter Highway volunteers waiting to clean up trash.  Could have also been holding bricks waiting to do the Reginald Denny impression.  Also a very, very viable possibility.  Here, take this with you.  Do a little dance.  You know what we haven't talked about yet?  Yeah.  The Ozzy interview yesterday was just amazing.  I could not believe how happy Jimmy was yesterday. 
[01:20:00]  What's up, Ben?  No, I asked him for something.  The happiest little guy.  Yeah, so Jim Norton's dream came true yesterday, and he got to talk to Ozzy in person.  Which I must say was very nice to have that whole thing work out.  That worked.  You know, we were supposed to have Ozzy come in.  It was supposed to be during the show.  So, he showed up, and we had a great time with him, and it actually all worked out.  It was something that worked.  I really enjoyed that interview.  I thought it was a lot of fun on so many levels. 
[01:20:30]  Ozzy was funny.  He was hilarious.  A lot of funny lines.  He's got a sense of humor about himself and his family and the whole situation with the TV show and his drug use.  I was walking around Georgetown and Norton yesterday, and he was just still on cloud nine, as they say.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  And he goes, man, I really thought you were going to throw me under the bus.  I'm like, do you understand, in the end, we're all true friends here?  What a scumbag thing that would be to do. 
[01:21:00]  Well, I panicked because you did mention it before.  I'm like, I didn't think you would, but then I'm like, well, what if he did?  Well, of course.  Why?  Wow, why does that happen?  Do you notice it's kind of fading a weird way?  Or what do you notice?  It's every time that door opens up.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's just like sucking the air or the oxygen out of the room.  I don't know.  That is weird.  Do you hear that door banging every time they close it?  Yeah, that's nice.  Well, it's just the little things you've got to get used to when you broadcast somewhere else.  They can't help every little situation.  Oh, no, how did I become the bad guy?  Just by mentioning that the door closed.  Hey, Kimmy, it's a door. 
[01:21:30]  What do you want him to do?  Hey, Kim, what do you want him to do?  Have Jaime just stand there and not close it?  I demand you put in Star Trek doors.  Just calm down, man.  Jeez.  Anyway.  Yeah, well, I am a dick enough to just have it in the back of your mind that you might be thrown under the bus.  But, you know, when it comes down to it, we're all really good friends, and I would never do that to you because that was your moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go, but just hear me out, though.  That's the only person I wouldn't throw you under the bus.  Just Ozzy.  That's it.  That's the only guy.  You really don't have any other huge heroes.  Although, yesterday, you were talking about Robert Plant, which would have been, like, huge. 
[01:22:00]  I like Robert Plant.  But I like Robert Plant a lot, but not like that.  I mean, Richard Pryor is the only other guy on that level.  Well, we're not going to get much of an interview with him these days, unfortunately.  So, Ozzy comes in, and just a few observations that we didn't talk about because we had to get right off the air yesterday.  But I've never seen Jim Norton look like he did yesterday.  He was just the happiest guy.  He looked like, you looked like you were 12 years old. 
[01:22:30]  You were just, like, in amazement.  Cute and tussleable.  And he spent the first 10 minutes, when Ozzy was in studio, I'd have to listen to the tape again, but barely talking.  I didn't say a word.  Just looking at him, looking at his eyes, looking at everything on his body.  Staring at Ozzy like a madman.  Looking at all his rings, his jewelry, his, you know, just everything.  His black left pinky nail with that really cool pinky ring he has.  With that thing on there, yeah.  He's got that really great, like, three-quarter length pinky ring on his finger. 
[01:23:00]  It's not even like a ring, it encases his pinky, where it looks like some kind of vampire thing.  Yeah.  Like, encases his pinky, and then he's got the nail coming out.  Well, that's really cool.  That's like the coke nail from the old days.  That's exactly what it looks like.  And I was, like, looking at his cross.  He looked really healthy.  It was the best I've ever seen Ozzy look in the last 20 years.  It was the healthiest I've seen him look.  It's all trimmed down.  And he sounded very healthy, too.  He wasn't, you know, babbling like he usually does.  And then, so Jim was just taking it all in, which I found fascinating. 
[01:23:30]  I was watching Jim watch Ozzy, because I'm like, wow, this is how it is when you get to meet, you know, your hero, I guess, you know.  And then, slowly but surely, Jim finally loosened up, like, oh, my God, I'm going to blow this.  I've got to start talking.  Like, you couldn't talk.  You were petrified.  I couldn't.  I had questions.  You were, like, paralyzed, it looked like.  I was for the first 10 minutes.  I had questions written down.  And as soon as he walked in the door, when they said, Ozzy's here, it was like, uh-huh.  Oh, he got all scared.  I realized that I had a paper with worthless ink on it, and those words meant nothing in human translation. 
[01:24:00]  He had spent all day writing down these questions that he wanted to ask Ozzy in red ink.  He had a whole big sheet of paper, and I guess three-quarters of it was just full of questions for Ozzy.  And I guess as you're writing them, you're thinking, yeah, this is good, this, that.  And then once Ozzy showed up, he quickly reviewed his questions and realized they meant nothing.  Because when he walked in, and you guys were great yesterday, because you guys were so comfortable,  and it's like, you, and she starts talking to him, and it's like, that was a great way to interview him. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, man, blah, blah, blah.  And then I'm looking at my stupid, my fucking Bill O'Reilly list of questions that I have for my idol.  So, what do you do before a show?  Question.  Shit, I was.  Question.  Nothing intuitive to ask him, nothing real.  Do you have that list of questions still?  They asked me to sign it.  They want to try to get it on eBay.  They're putting it on eBay.  Is it cool?  Oh, you should.  Dude, it was.  Yeah, let's all sign that.  Because I think we tried extra hard yesterday just for you, by the way. 
[01:25:00]  Here's what happened.  Let's be honest.  Anthony and I call this in every day, you know.  We've been doing this so long.  Call it in.  We're like, when Jim's meeting his hero, I guess we've got to try today.  You guys wanted Ozzy in.  We want to make your experience very enjoyable.  But you would have, because we had to come to D.C. and Ann had to go away.  And I know that you guys would have said, look, we love Ozzy.  We'll be happy to have him next time.  But for me, I know you guys are like, let's just stay in town.  You guys did that for me.  And I knew you did.  And I knew you gave him a great interview.  So, I really, I really was very grateful yesterday. 
[01:25:30]  For little Jimmy.  I was, if you would have just, like, let me do the interview, I would have sat there.  And it would have been horrible.  I was too nervous to talk.  I couldn't ask him anything.  No, you couldn't even, I'm not even kidding.  You were paralyzed.  Yeah, I couldn't talk.  If Ann and I walked out of the room, it would have probably made for some great radio.  But I don't think you would have been able to pull it off.  Which just amazes me.  Because you got, you know, you're famous in your own right and have a huge following.  But you couldn't even talk to him.  And then when you loosened up and started interacting with Ozzy, it was a cool moment for me.  I'm like, wow, look at this.  You know, what's going on here. 
[01:26:00]  This is the beauty of Ozzy, man.  This is why I like him.  It's like, well, most people come into the studio, they know Opie and Anthony.  I mean, they just look at me and think I'm some oddball in the studio, which is not an  incorrect assumption.  But they normally will just talk to you guys.  But the beauty of Ozzy was he was talking to you guys and he was also addressing me.  And when I would ask him something stupid, he didn't just politely nod at me and then  talk to you guys.  He was actually answering me.  It was really weird to, like, realize.  I'm like, Ozzy Osbourne is talking to you right there.  It was so surreal.  Oh, I know.  You're looking right into his eyes.  Oh, dude, it was... 
[01:26:30]  He really enjoyed his time with us, too, you know.  He loved it.  I could just tell.  You could tell when someone just hates being there and he was really into it.  You know, I could see him coming back, maybe not just once, and maybe, Jim, maybe some  kind of friendship, dare I say, gets sparked up between you guys.  The best part was when he noticed you blinked a lot.  I blinked a lot.  Oh, my God.  He goes, are you winking at me?  He's like, no, I'm just twitching like a nervous Nelly.  No.  He's like, somebody says, somebody goes, I don't suck cocks, Jimmy. 
[01:27:00]  I was like...  And he had no problem with your experience with the...  The tranny.  He didn't care.  Thank you for saying the word, because I still have a problem saying that word.  Tranny?  Tranny.  Tranny.  There you go.  Tranny.  I said it.  Well, it's a fine word.  You can knock that one off my list of words that I have conquered.  Oh, tranny.  Done.  And he was...  Put.  Put.  Put and tranny.  There you go.  Only a hundred words to go.  Put the money in the tranny's hand.  Tranny Island.  Where's that? 
[01:27:30]  Dot com.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You had to speak.  Hi, boys.  You had to speak.  Now we're going to have problems.  How you doing, boys?  We're in the middle of our Aussie post-interview.  I'm going to blow your mind who's going to be in here tomorrow.  You're here.  We already know.  I'm staying around for a picture.  Robert.  Is he going to be here, here?  Here, here.  In our studio.  You want him?  Doing our show.  More than anything.  Is he going to get up that early?  That's the problem.  That's the problem, see?  What time is he scheduled to come in?  He's scheduled to come in later in the afternoon.  I know it's either dinner with him tonight or tomorrow night.  He hasn't decided. 
[01:28:00]  Have you seen what they're doing in Performance One?  No.  The big studio.  No way.  They are recreating Morocco in there.  No joke.  They've got silk hangings and plants and candles all over the place.  And our phones don't work, but it's Morocco.  Wait, wait, wait.  What was that about?  What was that about?  It might be a literal circumcision in the other room, but we can't get a call from fucking  Bubba somewhere.  Let me get more details on Robert Plant.  What was the big deal this morning with all the...  Oh, we don't want to go back down that road.  We're in a happy place now.  Okay.  All right.  Sorry. 
[01:28:30]  I do believe...  Sorry.  I do believe at least three people will be fired over it, though.  Oh, nice.  I got one, two...  Three down?  Three down.  And I got to send out a special thank you, obviously.  Ben did a great job.  Lee Abrams, I know, really helped out.  And the booker was great.  She came through big time, worked through MTV.  So, I mean, look, we talk shit when things aren't good, but that was a tough one to get.  And, man, she pulled a lot of strings and got us Ozzy.  And that was, I think, 80% her.  So, fucking great, man.  This is where this is all leading to.  We'll get to Bruce in a second. 
[01:29:00]  It was like a Make-A-Wish Foundation thing for a retard.  Jimmy was like a Pejoria kid going to Neverland.  It really was.  We should really start our own Make-A-Wish experience for ourselves.  I wish the phones were...  There.  That's all I ask for.  All I want is something signed by Kurt Cobain.  That's all I want.  A real hologram.  I was thinking, that's going to be a hard signature to get there.  That's gettable, man.  There's a lot of stuff with this stuff. 
[01:29:30]  Dude, I was at the Hard Rock Cafe trying to figure out how to unscrew something that's upstairs.  And then I asked Hard Rock Johnny.  I'm like, dude, $1,000 cash.  What?  Wow.  You're offering a buy set?  No, he said no.  So, now I can talk about it on the air.  I'm like, here's $1,000 cash.  Give me a screwdriver.  I want to take that thing home.  What was it?  It was a nice thing that he signed.  You can find Kurt's stuff.  Steve brought it up on eBay or something.  There's tons of stuff.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Because you can trust everything that's on eBay.  Screw that. 
[01:30:00]  You need some kind of...  And I don't even trust the certificate stuff anymore.  No.  Our friend Jay, good old Jay, he bought a Lou Gehrig signature for one of his brothers.  Oh, no.  Dude, he shows it to me.  He's like, what do you think?  You know, my brother's a huge baseball fan.  This is his Christmas present this year.  When I go back to Atlanta, this thing, the autograph was in pencil.  And I'm like, oh, Jay.  And then he shows me the thing, the certificate.  They did use to use pencil.  I know.  Then he shows me the certificate.  And I go, well, did you compare it with other Lou Gehrig autographs, maybe online? 
[01:30:30]  He goes, yeah, it kind of looks like it.  How much did he pay?  How much?  It was a lot.  How much?  I really don't know.  I don't want to just throw a number out there.  Was it more than $1,000, do you think?  Probably, yeah.  Probably right around $1,000, maybe $800, somewhere around there, I think, if I remember correctly.  So then...  What was it on?  I think it was a letter or something.  Yeah.  This goes back a couple of years.  And then I told Jay, you know what?  Your brother's never going to know.  Just freaking give it to him.  He'll be excited that he has a Lou Gehrig, even though it's probably Bob from North Carolina 
[01:31:00]  to decide to make a few extra bucks.  Yeah.  But if the person doesn't know for sure that it's not a real autograph, then I guess to  him it's a real autograph, right?  Oh, he'll question it.  It's so hard to get memorabilia and know it's real.  So many people get ripped off.  Right.  So we've got to get back to the Aussie thing.  So it was a big day for Jimmy, and we come down here.  He's still on Cloud 9.  And decides to end his evening on an old note. 
[01:31:30]  You know, that's where we've been leading to for the last 20 minutes.  It's just the release of that drug in your brain, whether it's dopamine or whatever it  is that releases when you're in this rush, this joy, this euphoria.  And that's what I was having all day with Aussie.  I was...  I can't.  And Steve got him to do drops.  Oh, I know.  Do we have the drops available?  Oh, the drop he did.  He did one drop that was really good.  It was unbelievable.  I heard this.  It was like one of these days where everything is perfect.  Yep. 
[01:32:00]  Nothing was wrong.  Hello.  My name's Aussie Osborne.  And you're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  What a fucking little guy he is.  That's the one with the echo put into it.  There's another one, too.  Yeah.  Well, Steve plays that for us after the show.  And Jimmy started hugging Steve.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe he got it.  It was a real moment.  It wasn't Jimmy being, like, silly.  He grabbed Steve and hugged him and was like, oh, thank you, thank you.  Yeah, it was so great.  And anyway, it was just one of those days where everything was perfect. 
[01:32:30]  Aussie just signed the picture I had of he and I.  You know, it was just a...  Yeah.  I didn't bring a lot of stuff to sign.  Just one picture.  And I got a shot with him.  It was just fun.  He was so nice.  And last night we come down to D.C.  And I'm like, I'm going to finish this evening off right.  And what better way to do with that?  Ball bag release.  The perfect day for you now, this would amount to.  Yeah, the perfect day.  But I just couldn't get enough.  Greedy scumbag me.  Greedy, never wants to party to end and face who he really is in the mirror scumbag me.  You couldn't just go to sleep with a smile on your face. 
[01:33:00]  Couldn't just thank God and go to bed.  Right.  No.  I had to go on a Craigslist and have a young lady of the evening come over.  And she was atrocious.  Really?  Really?  Atrocious.  Now, looking or the technique, what was bad about her?  And was there a picture of her?  No, she didn't have a pic online.  Oh, no.  And she didn't want a lot of money.  And believe me, I'm like, oh, for two.  But I'm like, you know what?  I don't really want much.  That's all I want.  Right.  Little hummer.  Go to bed. 
[01:33:30]  So she comes over.  And I'm like, are you a BBW?  Which big, beautiful woman.  Fat chick.  She said no, but she should have said yes because she was a big, black whale.  She was a fatso.  She was a fucking fatso.  How fat?  Not fat enough to need a crane to remove from the home.  But fat enough where if somebody was assaulting her with a bat, you wouldn't call 911.  Wow, that is really awful. 
[01:34:00]  I wanted to carve my initials in her back while she laid on the beach and some liberal threw  water on her.  Fat whore showed up and ruined my Aussie.  I looked through the peephole and I'm like, argh.  So she comes in.  I was thinking of the chick that showed up in Risky Business.  What's happened to be a man?  You know who she...  Was she kind of manly?  She was atrocious, dude.  What time was this about?  Ballpark. 
[01:34:30]  Lost all concept of time and space.  It was late.  It was late because I heard some yapping out in the hallway.  Was she yapping?  Oh, my God.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's heard some loud yapping.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You better let me in.  Oh, no, no, no.  It was nothing...  You're giving my goddamn money.  It was nothing aggressive like that.  No, okay.  But she won't do anything.  Maybe it was Jimmy going, and stay out.  No, no, no, no.  It wasn't like that.  It was 150 bucks.  And she comes in. 
[01:35:00]  I'm like, look, I just wanted, you know...  You get right to business with someone like this.  That's all I wanted, yeah.  And she's shy.  She's like, um...  What?  Dude, you don't understand.  She was shy.  She's like, I don't know.  I don't know.  She wanted me to go down on her first.  Dude, I...  Holy Jesus.  You're kidding.  I swear to God.  Swear to God.  Are you kidding me?  She wanted me to go down on her first, and she's like shy about getting undressed. 
[01:35:30]  She's like, can you do it in the other...  Can I do it in the other...  She wanted me to leave the room, and I'm like...  Yeah, look around for what she could steal.  So I'm like, yeah, I'm not doing this.  Oh, brother.  And I'm looking at her, and she's awful, and I'm like, I really don't want to.  And I was trying to think of, like, why do I want to be a scumbag and be mean?  So I'm like, look, I've got to get up really early.  It's really late.  Maybe you could just do me.  And she's like, I don't know.  She's like, I'm not...  I swear...  Dude, it was like...  I don't know.  I was waiting for Alan Funt to come out of my closet and go, she's not really a hooker.  She's an actress. 
[01:36:00]  I wound up...  This is actually Joanne Flug in disguise.  We put Joanne Flug in a fat suit and sent her to little Jimmy Norton.  I wound up giving her...  I said, just give me back 50 and leave.  Are you kidding me?  The only reason I didn't...  You paid to have her leave.  The only reason I didn't freak out and demand at all is because you...  And again, you never know who you're dealing with.  Somebody could have mace or start screaming and yelling.  It's just not worth it.  And it was almost like a joke.  Like, this is what you deserve, asshole. 
[01:36:30]  This is what you deserve.  Well, it's just because you got greedy, like you said.  You got greedy.  This is what you deserve.  Go down on me.  No!  No!  Go down...  What?  She was awful.  I'm paying you, lady.  George from Philly wants to know if it was Mabel King with legs.  No, no, she wasn't that fat.  She was just awful.  She was just like awful.  Did she smell?  I don't think she smelled.  No, I would love to say yes, but I'm sure she would have had I gotten that far.  So what was she thinking coming into your room?  I don't...  She's like, can we get to know each other first? 
[01:37:00]  Know each other?  She was...  This girl, I don't know if she was an actual 24-hour, 7-day-a-week hooker.  This was something she was probably doing for some extra cash.  She...  What was she expecting?  Dude, I have no idea.  How much did it finally cost you?  A hundred bucks.  A hundred bucks for an annoying woman to come to your house and then to kick her out?  Had I been willing to go slow, I do think she would have done something.  She was really nervous.  She wasn't being...  She wasn't in rip-off mode.  And I believe me, I've had them show up. 
[01:37:30]  It wasn't like that.  It wasn't like, well, let's...  She's like, well, can we go slow?  Like, do you think we could just sit here for a little while?  And, like, she wanted to, like, make it, like, a regular experience.  I guess to fix it in her head.  That I'm not just coming over here.  And maybe she saw me without a shirt and realized, yeah, it's not worth the money.  Hob the knob.  Take your money and leave.  Dude, it was...  Jesus.  Just awful.  I had a similar story.  And I think I told Anthony this a while ago.  Back when the internet first started, maybe about eight years ago, nine years ago, I was 
[01:38:00]  talking to a girl online.  And it's before I got pictures.  Remember when you first started and you really got pictures?  And I talked to her a couple times.  And one morning, a Saturday morning, we're talking about sex.  And she's like, I'm really horny.  So, you know, she described herself to me.  And I said, what do you look like?  She's blonde hair, this and that.  But, you know, when you try and talk about being fat, you try to be discreet about it.  So she described herself, you know, I have, you know, like a 28-inch waist. 
[01:38:30]  And I said, okay, she sounded decent.  Pleasantly plump.  Yeah, so I said, okay, I'm going to let her...  She's going to come over to my house because she's looking to get laid.  And I was looking to get laid.  It was a Saturday morning.  So I'm on the cell phone with her as she's getting close to my house.  Yeah.  She pulls up in front of the house and gets out of the car.  And she is huge.  She had to have been 250 pounds.  Holy Jesus.  And I'm like, now she knows it's my house because I'm on the phone with her and she's pulling up in front. 
[01:39:00]  So I'm like, what do I do?  I didn't know what to do.  So she came in.  Wow.  And she's humongous.  So I said to myself, set your house on fire.  That's what you do in that situation.  She sees flames jumping out a window.  You go, sorry, my house is on fire.  You got to take the hit.  You just got to run out of the house with your cell phone going, the house is on fire.  I just called 911.  So she comes in and she sits on the couch and I'm looking at her and I'm saying to myself, all right, I'm going to let her blow me. 
[01:39:30]  So she takes her shirt off and she has these huge, sloppy, disgusting cans.  Of course.  But I pull my pants down and she starts going down on me.  Of course.  And I'm like rubbing her tits and everything and I'm looking down and I can't even look at her.  And it just got to the point where I tapped her on the shoulder and I said, you know what, you got to go. 
[01:40:00]  You tapped her out?  I tapped her out.  I tapped her out.  I'm out.  She had my cock in her hand and she looked up at me and she goes, what?  And I go, I'm sorry, you got to go.  So, oh, wow.  And she said, why?  And I said, you know what, I have a girlfriend and I feel guilty.  There you go.  And that was my out.  But, I mean, she already started going down.  But I just couldn't finish.  It was disgusting.  Did she have a tear in her eye while she had your hog in her hand?  You know, she kind of was humiliating for her.  Tapped out.  Well, I think she probably, I think that was nice what you did and that's the way to do it. 
[01:40:30]  What you said to her.  Right.  Very pleasant.  That was the right way to do it.  All right.  You don't need a hassle.  You don't need her freaking out.  I, this chick was, was, was, uh, this chick was just, was gross.  Um, but I don't need her freaking out in the hotel.  I don't need her screaming and yelling.  I don't, I don't know if she's got some maniac with her.  That's true.  Driver.  It's not worth it.  And it's my own, sometimes I take responsibility for my own stupidity for being involved in that game.  It was like, that was your own dumbness.  And she was actually nice.  She wasn't, this wasn't like some, uh, I ain't doing shit. 
[01:41:00]  She really wanted this to be like an experience that she wanted.  I wonder if this could be her angle to get to, to, guys to pay her for not having sex.  No.  No, because she asked me to go down on her first and, uh, she was ready for that and she would have done that.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  How many guys are going to do that?  Oh, a lot of guys would.  A lot of guys would.  Especially since in our email chat, maybe we discussed certain things about her, her, the build of her, uh.  Oh, look, so she, okay, now you're getting, give me a little more information. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  You probably led her to believe you would be interested in doing that.  Oh, I did.  Of course, okay.  I absolutely did.  All right, now she doesn't seem as kooky.  Oh, no, no, no, I said in the, I didn't say that, in the chat on the phone, you gotta be careful on the phone, she's like, well, it's 200.  I'm like, ugh, that's a little steep.  And I'm like, she's like, well, how much were you thinking of spending?  And I'm like, 150?  And she's like, all right.  Wow, that seems like you're taking a big chance there on getting arrested.  Well, she, no, because we didn't say, no.  Over the phone like that?  Well, that's why we didn't, we didn't say it for sex. 
[01:42:00]  Prostitute for dummies.  She's gonna explain why that's okay.  I'll tell you what.  200, 150?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  It wasn't for sex.  Yeah.  She called, you know, we talked online, we called, and she's like, well, how much do you  look for the spend?  No sexual talk.  And she's like, what do you want to do?  I'm like, I don't know, man.  Maybe I could, we could each have an, I could give you an oral exam, you could give me an  oral exam, which sounds cheesy, but you know what?  That is not.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  We all know what it means, but it's not what you said.  And for a cop, there's no way a cop is just gonna show up at your hotel room, a female  cop, and put herself in that position, and take her clothes off before I show up. 
[01:42:30]  You know what I mean?  There's like, there's so many things that would have to happen.  Yeah.  Like, for me to go to their room would be a problem, because they could have cameras and  stuff.  But what is she gonna do, walk into my room and close the door behind her?  And I would take her top off, it's not gonna happen.  And I'd assume that the cops just wanna look the other way when it comes to this stuff.  It's when it becomes a public nuisance that they get involved, right?  I've never heard anything like that, where anyone's gotten busted setting up a phone.  On the phone, yeah.  No, no, unless you're going to their room.  Like, if a cop, if a female cop has a room set up, they'll have John's food all day, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Well, that's just to clean up an area, I'm assuming, though.  So that's what she wanted me, that's why she wanted me, I should have said that before,  that's why she wanted me to go down there first.  I thought she just bust out with this out of nowhere, saying, yeah, you go down,  no, that's not how prostitution works, lady.  She was so awful.  I was just disgusted, I'm like...  And now you, so you're going to bed.  You're done.  We were talking.  You kick her out.  Nothing happened.  Yeah.  Nothing, she didn't touch my mule.  Would she have?  She's like, well, do you want me to give you a hand release?  And I'm like, no. 
[01:43:30]  No, I don't.  Jesus.  So there it is, Anthony.  That was the end to meeting my idol.  We were talking to my idol.  It was supposed to be his big special day, and he ruins it in the end.  That's the beauty of Jim Norton.  I had a dessert.  We all went out.  I shoved a white chocolate mousse into my fat face.  I'm like, it's time to treat yourself, little Jimmy.  You had a good day, thanks to the boys.  Did you hit the minibar and everything?  Big Daddy's here.  Oh, God.  Big Daddy, living large.  The Mad Mexican has entered the studio, Anthony. 
[01:44:00]  When we come down to Washington, we like to catch up with all our friends.  Bruce Kelly from the 80s channel is in the studio.  All of our Hispanic friends, right?  And now we've got the Mad Mexican.  When do you start your show there?  Not in.  A couple of minutes.  A couple of minutes.  So you came in to say hi?  I came to say hi.  Who was the sick one?  Well, we know both of you are sick, but who was ill?  Who was ill?  You were ill.  No, I wasn't.  You were.  It was actually me.  Oh, you were ill.  What I have, there's cocktails for, but there's really no known cure. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, okay.  I understand that.  Oh, no.  This guy says, tell him this.  Yeah, he has AIDS.  Oh, he does.  Yeah, everyone knows that.  I'm trying to hear that.  That's fine.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Well, I've got a plate in my head as well, so we're just going to go over that.  Same thing.  Plate in the head, it's the same thing, right?  Yeah.  So what are you doing on your show today?  What I'm going to do is offend the masses, which, excuse me, what I usually do, and I'm  just going to go out there and have a good time, talk to the people, and, you know, play 
[01:45:00]  the request, and that's essentially it.  What was that song I like that you played?  Oh, that was Fuego.  It's by the Cumbia Kings.  They're out of Corpus Christi.  Oh, yeah.  Are we going to get to hear his intro today?  You're going to give us a big plug?  No, but of course.  Right at 9 o'clock?  I'm crazy, but I'm not unreasonable.  Of course I'll do it.  Are we going to be able to get that set up, Ben?  Okay.  We got it here.  Why aren't you wearing anything with your dog's name on it?  Chicago.  I have a Chicago cap.  Chicago?  Chicago cap and a controller.  I was just getting ready to go on.  I had headphones and everything.  I just want to make sure your dog is still fine and everything's good. 
[01:45:30]  He is still in one piece.  You didn't back over him on your way to the station or anything like Don Geronimo did.  You really love this dog, Chicago, huh?  Yeah, that's my boy.  I'm his only family.  It's a bit of an obsession, we've noticed.  No, not an obsession.  You got Chicago hats, Chicago shirts, Chicago.  We thought he was a fan of the band, and his dog's name is Chicago.  I'm a fan of the band.  You got dog pictures in your cubicle.  Yeah.  Well, tomorrow I'm going to bring a thing for Jim.  Can you bring your dog in tomorrow?  Yeah, sure.  I can bring him in.  If they let me in, I'll bring him in. 
[01:46:00]  I would like to check out your dog, Chicago.  We've heard so much about him.  If they let me bring him in, I'll do that.  That would be awesome.  And he has a desk with a little, I like the little jelly beans and the hammer right next  to him, so when a girl leans in to take a jelly bean, you just clobber.  That's it.  He has the jelly beans set in such a way in his cubicle where the girls have to bend over  to show their cleavage to grab some jelly beans.  Yeah.  We know how you think there.  Always a motive.  Gentlemen, I didn't want to go, but you made me.  See ya. 
[01:46:30]  I got to go on.  Oh, he's got to go for his show already?  I got to get the show ready.  Good to see you, Jim.  Good to see you, buddy.  All right.  Gentlemen, bring your dog in tomorrow, all right?  I will.  I'll bring your dog in tomorrow.  And we'll listen to the intro of your show and all that, and great.  See you, Bruce.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  See ya.  Oh, Jesus.  Close the door.  Oh, boy.  Close the door.  Oh, brother.  Is this yours?  There you go.  I'm telling you, you guys are so lucky.  Why?  Because upstairs, this is every bad radio station you've ever worked at.  Yeah.  With every freak combined into one. 
[01:47:00]  And he's obviously one of them.  He's a nice enough gentleman.  Oh, he's a sweet man, yeah.  Comes in, talks about his dog.  I like the mad Mexican.  And now he thinks Jimmy has AIDS.  Good.  Let him.  We'll check out the intro to his show in a few minutes.  Hell yeah, Dee Dee.  Yeah, Dee Dee's got to do the news.  She's got her hair done, and I see she's got makeup, and we've noticed, Dee Dee.  Jimmy, she doesn't believe you and the hooker story.  Oh, she is mortified of you and the hooker story.  She doesn't believe it at all.  She should have seen me after the hooker left, and that didn't take Jimmy Norton out of himself. 
[01:47:30]  So I opened the mini bar, and I ate a half a tin of Pringles, and I did Diet Coke.  You ate the Pringles in there?  And I ate half of the Twizzlers.  Twizzlers?  Sugar and sodium, and I'm like, you're not going to be able to sleep.  And then I did, and my heart is do-do-do-do-do, and caffeine in the Diet Coke.  Oh, my God.  This is probably 2.30 in the morning.  I'm laying in bed wide awake just thinking about my awful evening end.  Did you eat the famous Amos cookies?  No, I didn't go to the cookies.  Oh, I ate those, and I ate, like, three Kit Kats, because they've got those huge Kit Kat bricks in there.  Oh, you've got to eat those.  Yeah.  Did you put the wax lips in your mouth and go, arrr, I'm a hooker, arrr? 
[01:48:00]  I should have.  Then I could have gotten down on her.  It wouldn't have bothered me.  Yeah, for some reason, in the mini bar, there's those big wax lips.  Yeah, I saw that.  And you put them in.  Yeah.  Put them in your mouth and walk around.  They're red, too.  Walk around like you live here.  What's wrong, babe?  He was like, oh, my God.  He was talking about going down on the hooker.  Why?  She is mortified.  Oh, I can't wait.  Did he have a smart pantsuit?  Yeah.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  We'll talk to Didi next.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? 
[01:48:30]  That's a lot of appointments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  Fix it.  Fix it.  Guess who's back?  I'm over here now.  Back hook it.  Nice head, dick. 
[01:49:00]  Back.  Bag it.  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  Back hook it.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  So bad.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Back hook it.  Guess who's back?  Celebrate.  Turn it off.  Hey!  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Turn it off?  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Oh, man. 
[01:49:30]  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What's up?  What the hell doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little hope.  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little hope.  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so empty without me.  Hey, Anthony.  Okay, cut.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime. 
[01:50:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Make no mistake about it.  These are evildoers.  Yes.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Blah.  Live from Washington, D.C.  They have no justification for their actions.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  This is evil.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting, waiting for us to. 
[01:50:30]  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so sick of waiting for us to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, it's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, oh, make a move.  Live from Washington, D.C., it's the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:51:00]  I guess the phones are working now, Anthony, but we could try it.  But there's nothing worth going to on them?  No, not really.  Okay.  But they're supposed to be working.  Yeah.  No more over?  You don't have to work it like a CB radio?  Yeah, I think it might be working now.  And we've got the Mad Mexican.  He's about to start his show.  We want to hear his big intro.  Listen in.  He's going to give us props in another language.  That's always fun.  It's only recognized two words in the whole thing.  Props in another language.  Opie and Antonio. 
[01:51:30]  I don't think he calls me that, does he?  I don't know.  Opie and Anthony in the wrong order.  N-D-O-P-E.  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  Yeah, let's get D in here.  We'll break into the Mad Mexican show when he's doing his thing.  But first, the return of D.D.  We met D.D. the last time we were in D.C.  Thanks to Bruce Kelly.  Yeah.  Bruce, no 80s music to play or something right now?  Why, you want me out or what?  I don't want to go.  I can't go back in.  Just kind of traipsing around the studio.  I can't go back in. 
[01:52:00]  Popping in uninvited and stuff.  Just sit down.  I can't go in there anymore.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't do it.  Just walks in.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, I'm part of the show today.  Yeah.  Just let me sit down.  He's the Valium of the program.  Yeah.  We all talk like we're way up here hyper.  We're on coffee.  And then, hey, guys.  Yeah.  Bruce Kelly here.  Well.  And you notice that, yeah.  Hey, that Mad Mexican.  How about him?  That I'm really smooth and cool.  Yeah.  How about the super cool?  Super cool.  And I'm just like, you know. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  Not a doubt.  Dee Dee, what's up?  Dee Dee?  Good morning.  Oh, my God.  Are you really a hooker?  No.  She's just being silly.  No, come on.  Because she really was horrified.  She was horrified.  I'm just being silly.  In the other room.  Are you kidding me?  I'm just joking around.  Why do you feel you have to pay for sex?  Look at me.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to Mad Mexican.  Turn it up.  Orale.  It's a Mad Martes Tuesday 22 de Marzo.  Cámara Pestadora Grupo Montes de Durango.  Los invasores y Capaz de la Sierra. 
[01:53:00]  Quiero darle un buenvenido a Opie and Anthony.  Se vinieron aquí a la capital, Washington, D.C.  Están aquí con el cómico famoso Jim Norton.  Y un saludo para ellos.  Están aquí visitando.  Y it just so happens que Jim Norton, el cómico famoso, quería oír la canción Cumbia  King's Juego.  Vámonos, Recio.  Ah, the song that you like. 
[01:53:30]  King's, baby.  Yeah.  King's of cumbia.  Woo-hoo.  Give me song requests.  That's a nice one.  This is America still, right?  I think so.  We didn't go off the border.  I think we're still in the United States.  Man, there's a whole thing going on in this country we have no idea about.  I like that switching back and forth from English to Spanish thing.  I watch some of the Spanish channels on TV.  Yeah.  And the only words they don't say in Spanish are like Washington, Houston, you know, states 
[01:54:00]  and cities.  Yeah, but every so often, Mad Mexican just pops into English for a couple of words that  aren't cities or locations and then just goes right back into Spanish.  It's hard to eat.  Like, oh, you know, jelly beans are chloroform.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, so let's get back to Dee Dee.  Thanks for that, Steve.  Martini Steve doing a great job in the other room.  I'll say.  All right, so Dee Dee's in studio.  We met her last time because we're still trying out news people, I guess. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  That's not funny.  Why are you snorting already?  I snort.  Dee Dee has a very unique voice and she likes to snort a lot when she finds something funny.  It's just one of those things.  It's a very, like, cartoonish voice.  Yeah.  To say the least.  And she does the traffic reports.  Yes, for Chicago and Minneapolis.  For Chicago and Minneapolis.  And she also did XM Kids.  Yeah.  For a while.  But now we find out.  I was crooked, but no longer.  Yeah, we find out she is no longer on XM Kids. 
[01:55:00]  And I think we had something to do with that.  Well, when she was talking dirty and then had to go down the hall and talk to kids, there  seemed to be a little conflict.  What did they say?  It was two Pee Wee Hermanists.  It was two Pee Wee Herman where Pee Wee was doing his show, but he's jacking it in  movie theaters in Florida.  Which I thought was fine.  Yeah, I had no problem with Pee Wee.  That was Pee Wee's private life.  What the hell?  The guy, you know, he didn't even look like Pee Wee at that time, right?  So Dee Dee was horrified when Norton was talking about the hooker.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's looking at him kind of strange.  I don't know. 
[01:55:30]  I just never met somebody who admitted to that.  Really?  You're the first guy I've ever met that really said they were with the hooker.  Seriously, that's a true story.  If you had a month, I couldn't tell you all the true stories.  Yeah, he's just...  You have no idea.  It's awful.  But what about STDs?  Well, that's their problem.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, and we're not even talking like responsible where perhaps protections involve stuff.  Ew.  He just goes to town. 
[01:56:00]  You don't understand, Dee Dee, it just can't happen to me.  You can find...  There's somebody for everybody.  No, I'm careful with STDs.  I'm not stupid.  He cures all that with Tylenol.  He's fine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I'm serious.  Ask him.  No, seriously, though.  You can find somebody.  Yeah, I know.  Then why don't you?  He does every night for a price.  No.  Yeah, absolutely.  I found a girl.  My name is craigslist.com.  And she's lovely.  Well, that's what you get for doing that.  I know.  That's why I only took back 50. 
[01:56:30]  Because, again, I get involved in the game sometimes.  That's what you get.  Did you believe things like that actually happen out there?  Well, I know they happen.  It's just I just never...  But you would think if you get a girl like that, she would come over, the money's paid,  what happens happens, and then she leaves.  You ever hear such a screwed up story where he's got to pay her, nothing happens, just  to get her out?  Isn't that odd?  It's sad.  It is sad.  I'm glad you said it.  I wish you were there.  You could have talked to her and said, look, just drink out of this kid's mule.  He's paying for this for Pete's sakes. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  See?  He's paying for it.  You eat it.  No, but you shouldn't have to do that, though.  It's not a matter of having to do it.  It's a matter of headaches that you avoid, and just the nonsensical conversations you have  to have, and the fucking baggage they carry.  He's in Washington.  This isn't familiar ground for him.  He doesn't know anyone here that he could just call up and perhaps go on a date, and  perhaps hope something will happen.  So he needs action right then and there.  Use your hand.  I have.  Please.  Like, there's never been an option I considered? 
[01:57:30]  Call a sex line and use your hand.  No, sex lines don't do it for me anymore.  They don't do it for me anymore.  No.  No.  To try to give a crack addict a, you know, a Tylenol PM.  There you go.  Get high with this.  Well, it's sad.  Ask him what he's really into.  What?  Oh, God.  He's got one thing he really likes in particular.  Watch the reaction.  Okay.  What are you really into?  Same thing everyone's into.  Sometimes you like to lay back, and you have a girl.  It's nothing dirty.  It's actually very good for you.  Where, you know, if she has to tinkle and I happen to be there, I mean, I'm like, why not? 
[01:58:00]  Ow.  She's losing her mind.  She's losing her mind.  You're not into that.  No, not at all.  You're kidding me?  I've never spent hundreds of dollars, even written checks for that type of stuff.  No, sir.  No.  Not at all.  You're right.  He called his first CD Yellow Discipline, DD.  He's really into that.  And every once in a while, if he's feeling it, why don't you tell her the final part of  the puzzle?  Well, there really is no final part of the puzzle. 
[01:58:30]  No.  What is it?  You might as well.  I'm just saying, if a girl's doing that and something else slips out.  Ow!  Because you had me say, won't you have me go.  Who's looking?  Oh, gross.  Because you had me say that way back when.  Did I really?  Yeah, that was one of the things you had me say.  Oh.  You can talk into that, Mike.  Yeah.  There you go.  I'm just kind of grossed out.  No, no.  Go ahead.  Talk into that.  No, remember you had me say, Uncle Jimmy, won't you make, you want me to make poopy  on you?  You had me say that.  Did I do it or did one of the listeners do it?  No, you said it was one of your favorite.  I think I might have made her say it. 
[01:59:00]  No.  Steve thinks he might have.  Oh, somebody said it was your.  Uh-huh.  Well, we didn't just pull that out of the air, DD.  No.  Wow.  That's wow.  Okay.  That's silly.  It's cute.  Well, you know, it's, you know, companionship.  Yeah.  It's more of the yellow discipline.  That's.  He likes things like that.  He says it tastes like a popcorn treat.  Ow.  Tinkle does.  You're going to make me throw up.  Why?  That's the goal here.  It's gross.  What's gross about it?  It's very hygienic.  It's gross.  It's good for you.  Dogs like that shit.  Exactly. 
[01:59:30]  And look at how happy dogs are.  Dogs are smart.  Dogs are smart.  They don't pay rent.  They just take dumps all over the place.  They laugh.  Play with other dogs.  Hey, come here in the park.  Come on.  I like you.  They stick it in.  Dogs have the right idea.  They stick it in.  Oh, my God.  You're amazed, aren't you?  I just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not into anything like that?  Any kinky stuff?  What?  You have a little kinky stuff?  A little kink to you?  A little kink. 
[02:00:00]  I mean, everybody has a dark side.  That's all I'll say.  Oh.  We all have it.  It's very human.  All right.  Dee Dee's got something going on.  I know what Dee Dee likes.  I know what she likes.  Stop.  Stop.  Oh, you weren't supposed to say that.  She's into whips?  No.  Okay, maybe.  I was going to say, every so often, she probably likes to get a little spanky.  The room is nodding.  I think she likes a little spanking every so often.  Of course she does.  Why is he turning red?  Why does everyone know you like to be spanked and whipped?  Or do you do the whipping?  The traffic department's a little wild.  A little wild over there?  The traffic department? 
[02:00:30]  Wait.  She does the whipping?  Yeah.  Is she the dominant one?  No.  I mean, she submits him.  Yeah.  She likes babies.  No.  They're all giving the...  Are you a switch?  She's a switch.  A switch?  Yeah.  I mean, are you both?  I does both.  Role play?  Yeah.  So what?  Wow.  I like to role play, too.  I just do it with porcelain around my face.  What's wrong with that?  Big mouth, Ari.  Oh, wow.  Big mouth?  The whole stamp knows.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Hugh Pinero just walked by and nodded.  I never thanked you.  How do they know this? 
[02:01:00]  It was at a party one time.  It came out.  Yeah.  You know, traffic and weather people were exciting.  Traffic and weather.  Do you have a whip?  I'm not going to say.  You have a little...  You know what you have?  A little riding crop, I bet.  You have a little riding crop.  All right.  The whole staff is coming in and getting in on the conversation.  Oh, God.  Hi, Ari.  And Jerry Burk.  Great.  State your name.  State your name and tell us what you know.  This is Ari.  It's Ari.  How's it going?  Oh, my God.  No, I work with her at a traffic party.  This is Jerry, too.  And I'm Jerry, and I work with her in traffic as well.  And it wasn't... 
[02:01:30]  And it wasn't...  It was not at a party.  No.  Unless you consider work a party.  No, you told me the next day.  The next day, you're like, oh, let me tell you what happened.  Well, what happened?  Fill us in.  It's all good.  Don't be embarrassed.  At least you don't like to tickle on people.  I know.  That's sick.  You're right.  No, no, being...  Having a whip put on you is healthy.  Right.  That's what you do.  I mean, it's okay.  What happened?  I want to know the story.  I'm not into that.  That's you.  We're not judging you on it.  We had a party here.  We had a party here one day.  It wasn't a party.  She told me the next day.  Yes, it was a party. 
[02:02:00]  Well, tell the story.  The story is that she was telling me about this dude that she met talking.  It's cool, you know?  And she was like, yeah, he kind of got a little scared because I brought up the whips and ch...  I brought out here...  I got...  She, like, came out in, like, her Catwoman suit or something.  Wow.  With a bullwhip and everything.  I think she might have had some electric shock treatment to shock the balls.  Whatever it was.  Are you into an electrical play, too?  Oh, you dirty girl.  No, he's making that up.  You dirty girl.  No.  I don't pee on anybody.  No.  I think she's not the electric razor that kind of, like, shorting it out. 
[02:02:30]  No, no, no, no.  You're making things up.  But that's true.  You are into that...  You like the way you're...  The leather thing you are.  I mean, Sticks' bones may break your bones, but whips and chants...  The whip?  The leather whip?  Do you like leather a little bit?  Sure.  It's okay.  Yeah?  Do you like...  Do you prefer to whip or be whipped?  What is it?  Do you prefer...  A paddle?  A little bit of both.  How about your switch?  Maybe a paddle?  What about a paddle?  You can't say the golden shower is dirty, because if you're into that lifestyle, you  understand, you know, GS is just a part of that lifestyle.  It's just one step farther than... 
[02:03:00]  Anthony's talking about a paddle.  I mean, what's the difference, really?  It's the same thing.  You think that cute voice changes when she goes into whip mode?  I'd love to hear it squeak when she gets her ass smacked off.  Hey, Deedee, would you bend over the console and let Jimmy spank you?  No.  Do you snort me when you do that?  That didn't sound like a no that couldn't be talked out of.  No, that wasn't a no with an exclamation point.  That was kind of a no.  Can we give you just a quick spank?  We'll even make sure no one else watches, so there's no record of it. 
[02:03:30]  I'm too embarrassed.  No, don't be embarrassed.  You know what we do?  We sling a mic in front of you.  Oh, my God.  I'm mad.  You just kind of stand up.  Jimmy will take his hand and smack your ass.  No.  You can have your pants on.  You can pull your pants off.  It's fine.  Maybe you just pull your pants down.  I don't have to pull the pants down to the mid-size.  I don't want his hands touching me because I touched a hooker.  No, don't take your belt off.  I don't use anything but my hands.  I don't know how to use a belt.  I've never used a belt on this one. 
[02:04:00]  I just heard something.  She will let someone else spank her.  Yeah, not Jimmy.  Okay.  She said not, Jimmy, because you touched a hooker.  I heard you say that.  Yeah.  So we'll let someone else spank you?  How about Steve C?  Steve C, are you a good spanker?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  Keith the Cobb might be good at this.  Oh, and does he have handcuffs?  Oh.  Look at her.  She all of a sudden turked up.  Wait, I think you talked about the handcuffs, too.  That was part of that.  All right, what the hell do you got in your dungeon at home?  You are dirty.  I don't have a dungeon at home. 
[02:04:30]  You're a dirty girl.  You don't have a closet.  It's a three-bedroom apartment.  Jesus Christ.  And she's moving into my neighborhood.  That's the most good.  Nice.  All right.  Thanks, guys, for the story.  Very nice.  We've got to get Keith to spank her now.  Now, Keith, could she?  No, but, like, would you like my belt?  Yeah.  No, I don't want the hands, though.  That would be a little weird.  All right, you want the belt, maybe?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  He's taking his belt off.  He's taking his belt off.  Get a belt off.  Do you want us to block the window so you're...  Oh, Harley!  Nah, she knows. 
[02:05:00]  They're cool with it.  They don't care.  Oh, my God.  Wait, he's got a belt.  Do you want the...  Listen, listen, listen to me, Dee Dee.  Oh, my God.  Because you guys...  You've got to work with these people.  We get to go back to New York, and no one's going to care about us.  But you have to walk these halls.  So you want us to cover up the window so no one knows what's going on?  Oh, fuck it.  I don't care.  All right.  No.  Okay, no.  Oh, my God.  I know.  This is going to hurt.  No.  Yeah, listen to that.  I could see this all ending in a nice human resources meeting at the end of the show.  Good radio.  She came in here to do news, but what the hell? 
[02:05:30]  We found out that Dee Dee has a kinky side.  All right, Dee Dee.  She's a dirty girl.  Oh, like you guys don't?  Everyone does.  Everyone does.  You're absolutely right.  You're absolutely right.  You may look like my dark side was so awful.  But I will never pee on anyone.  Okay, that's not your thing, but I'm not into being whipped.  I would never let somebody hit me with a belt.  It's not my thing.  All right, so let's set this up, Ben.  Dee Dee, now we've got to do a little role-playing here.  A little role-play to make this.  No, no, no.  No, I don't mean seriously.  I just mean like, you know, we can't just say, Dee Dee, would you please now bend over? 
[02:06:00]  We've got to say things like, you know, hey, bitch, bend over.  Well, what is your thing?  Here it comes to spank your ass.  What is your thing?  Step out of the car, man.  How do you prefer?  Oh, look at that.  She goes, I like that.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Don't photograph this newspaper.  You've been a bad girl.  Oh, no pictures.  You were speeding, weren't you?  Yeah.  Let's set it up.  Let's go.  Yeah, you were speeding.  I'm going to kill Ari. 
[02:06:30]  Okay.  Step out of the vehicle, please.  Oh, Jesus.  I want you to assume the position over the hood of the car.  I can't just see it.  Put your hands on the car, please.  Hands on the vehicle.  She's in her nice suit and everything, too.  She got all dressed up and business-like.  My partner here can either write you a ticket or we can maybe finish this some other way.  Please put your hands on the car.  This is for our safety as well as yours, please.  All right, mic her.  Hands on the car. 
[02:07:00]  Mic her ass and mic her mouth.  What?  Sorry.  We're just putting you on the rotisserie.  It's the mic on my ass.  Well, we've got to hear the snap.  No.  Just one time.  Okay, ma'am.  Assume the position.  Assume the position.  Bend over.  Bend over.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  He's putting her.  He's like doing if he was going to frisk her.  Don't do it too hard, though.  You can't do it too hard.  Put the feet back.  Why?  Oh, wow.  Give your feet back a little bit.  I love Dee Dee, man.  Wow. 
[02:07:30]  Dee Dee, you rule.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Just one time.  Really fast.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here we go.  I'm anticipating it.  You ready?  Not one time.  No.  We have to get the warm-up shots just to make sure it's being done right.  We don't want to go too hard.  Oh, my God.  They're all watched.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What are you doing?  Jesus.  Couldn't you pull your very long jacket off?  Oh, my God.  They're all out there.  All right, Dee Dee, listen to me.  We're going to start off slow because we've got to make sure it's the right, you know,  the right.  The right swing. 
[02:08:00]  The right swing.  So, start off slow.  And what you'll say, Dee Dee, is a little hard, a little hard until we get to the right.  You want me to say a little harder?  Yeah.  Yeah, until it hurts.  You can't start too hard because then you get hurt.  It's got to slow.  Yeah.  You want to lift up the back of your jacket a little?  No.  Why?  So your mind's exposed to it.  I'll feel it.  Just go.  Yeah, look at it.  Here we go.  All right, let her rip.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was nothing.  Jesus.  That was still nothing.  Nothing.  Uh-oh.  A little harder. 
[02:08:30]  Nothing.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That stomp.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that hurt.  Did she or did she not say a little harder?  Yeah, yeah, but I didn't think you were getting...  It went from that is nothing to, ow.  You did taunt him.  I mean, three times you taunted me.  I was being considerate.  That is exactly...  Now you have to rub the area.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  Did that feel good, though, a little bit? 
[02:09:00]  Not really, because it has to be with, like, my significant other, and then that will get  me going.  Yeah.  Most cops use a plunger back in New York, so I think I'm lucky.  I thought this Dee Dee girl was all innocent stuff, because everyone was like, but you got  it.  Listen to Dee Dee.  She's freaking out that Norton's talking about hookers, and look.  We got right into your dark side.  But do you like a paddle, too?  See, I was never into anything that's not, like, hands or anything.  You know, waves, paddles, nipple clamps.  Wow, you have a little kink in you. 
[02:09:30]  Everybody does, and if they say they don't, they're lying.  Wait, you do...  I'm sure my parents have that, too.  That's great with that voice, though.  It's make me harder.  Do you dominate, too?  Once in a while, but I'm not going to get into that.  No, no, I'm just curious, because I've heard about electrical play.  I've never done it yet.  I've never done it.  Electrical play.  She made that up.  How about CBT?  Do you do CBT?  What's CBT?  Oh, cock and ball torture.  I'm not into that either.  Cock and ball torture?  No, no, but you know about it.  Yeah, of course I do, but I'm not into it.  CBT. 
[02:10:00]  That's what it's called, CBT.  That's great.  No.  You got, like, fire going.  We can't even touch it.  But I'm not into it.  He's always tugging at his junk.  He's getting excited.  But I'm not into having to torture my mule.  I like to touch nicely.  Nicely.  That's hilarious.  All right.  Wow, DeeDee.  That is really good.  I'm a little stunned, a little surprised that you're into that.  I'm not always into it.  Yeah, no.  It's just one of those things.  Special occasion, significant other.  Exactly.  Comes out.  Sure.  Exactly.  I like that.  Not every day. 
[02:10:30]  That's good.  You're a free spirit.  All right.  Well, we got Lisa Simpson in the studio, and she's going to do the news for us.  Do we have the news, Ben?  Oh, great.  You ready for the news, DeeDee?  No.  I still hurt a little.  Does it hurt sitting down a little bit?  It's just a sting kind of feeling.  Your bottom's a little stinging.  What's your safe word?  You know about this shit.  Whoa.  You have a safe word, don't you?  Yeah.  Well, you have to.  What's the safe word?  Something funny?  Flowers?  My favorite color, green. 
[02:11:00]  Green.  Green.  It should have been Armageddon, like the gerbil story, I was thinking.  Isn't it something?  It's supposed to be something you would never really say.  It should be two different colors, like yellow.  I heard it as yellow and red light.  Like, yellow is like, all right, this is getting into an area that could be uncomfortable.  And red means stop.  Yeah, but green's my favorite color, so I use green.  Have you ever had to use it?  Yeah.  What caused you to have to use green?  I'm going to do the news now.  Well, just like, in general.  Look, help me out, because I'm into a different area of domination than you are. 
[02:11:30]  Not many people are listening today, because we had such technical problems today that  a lot of people gave up on the show today.  You know what, these safe words are supposed to be something you would never say.  As a matter of fact, Jaime's is, the phones are fixed.  Can you picture Ben getting spanked, saying, I've had enough, and they're like, well, he'll  never say that, you know, especially if you're in a bar.  My hair is so neat.  I can stand perfectly still. 
[02:12:00]  So what caused you to use your safe word?  Like, what type of activity?  Was it spanking, or was it nibble torture?  It was nibble torture.  Oh, wow, really?  And the clamps were too tight, and you said green.  Cool.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Can't even talk about it.  I'm embarrassed.  That's not embarrassing.  Embarrassed or it's getting you a little hot just talking about it.  No, no, I'm embarrassed.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I'm going to kill Ari for bringing this.  What was used on the nips?  Are they like clothespins or roach clip type things? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, they sell them at the store.  Oh, wow, specialty items.  Yeah.  Nice.  Do they tighten, right?  Like, you could tighten them slowly, slowly, and write them out of pressure.  Oh, wow.  I don't want to talk about that.  Well, it's interesting.  A lot of people don't know about it.  Let's talk about the kids that died in Minnesota.  All right, hold on, but I've got to tell you something.  I think that's stranger than what Norton does.  No.  Really?  No, no, no.  Pain and pooping is stranger.  Sorry.  Well, pooping is, I'm not into pooping.  You just said if something else comes out.  I was just being cute.  Yeah, why don't you tell her about the time where that thing, you know, shot onto your 
[02:13:00]  chest.  What thing?  The thing.  Milkthud?  Not the Milkthud.  Oh.  No, the Milkthud didn't show up my chest.  Oh, the suppository?  Oh, and it bounced off my chest?  It looked like the Kennedy assassination?  No, no, nothing.  It was just sometimes a girl says, yeah, I'm totally natural.  And a suppository shoots off your chest and then Governor Connolly is still holding his  hat and the motorcade continues on.  See, that's...  Yeah, no, you're awful.  But for me, like the nipple clamps, see, I'm not into having my nipples touched roughly  at all.  I like it nice. 
[02:13:30]  And a lot of guys are into having, like, you know, torture and having their, like...  A lot of guys?  More than you'd think.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I've talked to so many doms.  They want their balls tied up and stuff like that.  I'm sure you've run into guys like that that want it to be tied.  You know, yeah, of course you have.  I'm sure if you ask a dominatrix, she'll say a lot of guys because most of the guys she's  with, she's dominating and they'd be into that.  See, my friend in L.A. is a dominatrix and that's how I got into it.  Really?  She gave you a few ideas and pointers.  They seemed like a good idea to you and you figured you'd try them out.  Yeah.  Did you try them out?  How do you bring this up with guys? 
[02:14:00]  I just said, honey, to my significant other, he said, yeah, sure.  And we tried it out.  You're still with this guy?  No, not that one.  So you're not married?  Well, he's in traction somewhere.  No, not that one, but I'm with somebody else.  What did it start off with?  It has to start somewhere.  A little spank?  Can I do the news?  A little spank action?  Yeah, the spanking and the whipping and the nipple clamps.  Maybe you smacked your ass a little at first and you went like, ooh, but it didn't sound  like it was a bad thing. 
[02:14:30]  It sounded like it was good.  A little more each time.  Take it a little further.  Yeah.  You are filthy.  I love it.  No, no, because...  Yes, you are.  Oh, no.  You are a dirty, dirty girl.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  You need a spanking because you are so dirty.  You need a paddling.  Not all the time.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  Could Keith...  I like that.  I just have an idea here.  No, God.  Could Keith use the belt on you, not like he just did the last time, just enough while 
[02:15:00]  you do the news?  No.  I wouldn't be able to get through it.  Yeah, that would be kind of cool.  You read the news with just a little...  Everyone is applauding.  A little nice.  Oh, God.  Because quite frankly, you got some serious...  He's got a camera.  You got some very serious news stories today.  We got to lighten it up a little bit.  That's just like the Washington Post or something.  That's nothing.  All right, assume the position for the news.  Can I do it?  I don't want to do it standing off.  I want to like watch...  I feel more comfortable sitting right now.  Can't you lean on the...  Yeah, lean on the table. 
[02:15:30]  Come on.  Come on, dude.  She's crying.  All right, the belt is out.  We're all out of here.  Your friend's a dominatrix.  Yeah, Jaime...  Jaime's smiling.  Jaime's...  Jaime, you don't have to be in here now, do you?  Wow, Jaime.  Oh, God.  It looks like we found another freak.  Of course, down here.  He's a watcher.  I think Jaime messes the phones up on purpose just so Eric Logan takes him in the office.  Puts him over his knee.  Oh, my God.  I have a question.  Does your friend work for her?  Does she work for like...  Does she dominate?  Does she work...  Oh, no.  Is she... 
[02:16:00]  Okay, her domination.  Does she work in a place?  She has a mansion and all the rooms are like theme-oriented.  Not in the den, though, right?  In L.A.?  No.  Okay.  Is she hot?  Well, yeah.  Maybe I'll call her and I'll try to get in touch with her so you guys can talk to her.  See, that's interesting to me.  I've never done that stuff.  I've done a lot of stuff.  I've never done the aspect you're into.  That's what I'm asking about.  It's like...  I don't do it all the time.  I know.  You don't have to tell that.  I know.  I know.  It's okay.  I don't know if I can do that.  DeeDee's going to bend over to do the news. 
[02:16:30]  I can't bend over to do the news.  Let's at least give it a try.  At least stand.  You don't have to bend over.  Just stand before we read the news.  Stand up.  You want to talk about being a legend on our show?  People will talk about this for years.  The time DeeDee came in and did the news that she was getting spanked.  A little spanking.  I'm never going to get through the news if it's a...  Yeah, just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  We'll see how it goes.  All right.  Don't do it hard.  Oh.  She'll kick your ass.  My friend.  Oh, God.  It hurt that last one.  It certainly did, didn't it? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, Jesus.  There goes the mic on my ass again.  All right.  It'll be all right.  Do you want to bend over or do you want to just throw it a little bit?  I can't, like, bend over and, like...  Just a little bit.  All right.  Got to read the news.  All right.  Give us the...  Oh, Jesus.  There's the ticker.  And now with the news...  No, not the video camera.  No cameras.  No...  We promised there no cameras.  Yeah, no cameras.  Or photography.  The hidden cameras will take care of that anyway.  Wow.  All right.  Now with the news is...  Cricket is so non-existent anymore.  God. 
[02:17:30]  Now it's DeeDee with the news.  Oh, he just is making me.  Don't do it, like, in a rhythmic thing.  Surprise her.  Yeah.  Maybe wait a little longer and then hit her.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Let the anticipation build up.  Well, it's in my head already.  Okay.  And the news.  Okay.  This is going to be weird.  All right.  In Minnesota, you guys heard about those poor kids.  They're all dead now. 
[02:18:00]  Why are you laughing?  Because...  She keeps looking behind her.  It's not a funny story.  I know it's not.  I'm not laughing at the good story.  Just concentrate on the news.  I'm not laughing at the good story.  Okay.  In Minnesota, you know, at Red Lake...  I can't concentrate.  Listen, you're going to be a good girl, and you're going to read the news.  And you're going to do it now.  Oh, fuck.  God, everyone's dark side is coming out.  I think you've just done that a few times.  Okay.  Jesus.  What the hell's going on here?  In Minnesota, at Red Lake Indian Reservation, eight people... 
[02:18:30]  I can't concentrate with someone.  All you do is read it.  You're doing good.  You're doing good.  You're doing good.  I know it's going to come sooner or later, though.  Of course it does.  Yeah.  I didn't mean it like that.  Of course.  Of course.  Okay.  The shooting in Minnesota left ten people dead.  Fuck.  Eight at the school, and the two grandparents were killed in their house.  That hurt a little.  And then the gunman was found dead at the school as well, so another school shooting. 
[02:19:00]  Why are you laughing at another school?  She's crying.  That's awful.  I'm not laughing at them being dead.  It's the whip thing, okay?  Oh, yeah.  I got a little confused there.  Okay.  And then everybody knows about Terry Schiavo.  Who?  I haven't heard anything about this on the news.  Oh, yeah, right.  Like, it's not all over.  What about her?  Yeah, what about Terry Schiavo?  About how, you know, everybody's outraged.  Outraged. 
[02:19:30]  Outraged.  Outraged.  I've never heard of people being outraged.  Okay.  They're just outraged because they don't agree with the lawmakers that inappropriately intervened.  So what do you think, DeeDee?  It's wrong.  You know, that's...  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  Are you hitting both cheeks, at least?  You have to distribute the punishment.  What I heard is the judge ruled that the feeding tube will not be reinserted.  Okay, well, I heard last that they didn't make a decision yet. 
[02:20:00]  I just read that on...  Okay, that must have just happened.  Not too long ago.  And DeeDee, what do you think should happen?  I think she should die in peace the way she wants to.  I'm getting space.  Yes.  Um, yeah, I don't think it's right that they are going to do that.  Okay.  That hurt.  All right.  Um...  Don't worry.  Just read the news.  It's just, like, that last one kind of stung a little.  Uh-oh.  It's stung a little. 
[02:20:30]  I know, but, like, not doing the...  It's stung in a good way, I think.  Okay.  Well, motorists have seen gasoline prices rise for more than ten...  Jesus, Keith.  You're a break.  I can't.  Keith, let her say a few words.  Gasoline prices are on the rise, obviously.  Like, we don't know that, right?  So there's a bunch of junk out there.  But the fuel demand continues to increase, and both consumers and businesses are paying more. 
[02:21:00]  Officials say solid economic...  I keep looking back.  Solid economic growth is softening the blow of the gas prices, so they don't see a pain in this shit right now.  That hurt.  Oh, God.  I have news from Germany, but I don't think I should do it when he's with me.  Ah.  Why?  Because...  Wait, you only have two news stories today, or three?  Oh, there's one, two, three, and four.  Do you have entertainment news, sports news?  Well, the Pat O'Brien, but you guys were already talking about it.  He's in alcohol rehab. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, true.  Everybody's...  You've already...  You have skeletons in his closet.  I think...  Everybody.  So, we're all human.  It seems like...  Hi.  There's my friend.  It seems like he was making some phone calls he shouldn't have been making trying to get a three-way going, is what I hear.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  I think we'll play that audio after the break.  Okay, well, I'll talk about Germany now.  All right.  Some news from Germany.  Overseas news.  Germany postal workers reported a possible bomb threat after a package began to vibrate and make odd noises. 
[02:22:00]  Alarm!  Alarm!  Okay.  The police fetched the embarrassed sender who opened the package to show them that it was an inflatable sex doll.  Ah.  He was returning to the manufacture because he was unhappy.  He was unhappy that the built-in vibrator kept turning on at the wrong moment.  Yeah, that's the wrong moment.  So, obviously, he probably had complaints about his package and that's why you had to buy the doll.  And that's the news?  That hurt. 
[02:22:30]  Well, what about the lottery story from New York?  Oh, yeah, New York.  Yeah.  The scrap tickets and what about the...  But, see, there was so much in...  They were...  I was using the printer with the baseball people.  Yeah.  So, I couldn't get a lot done.  I don't have my own computer.  That's okay.  I think she's doing a great job.  Oh, my God.  My ass stings a little.  Is your ass all stingy?  A little.  Is it tingling?  But, it's kind of a good way, right?  Not right now.  I'm embarrassed.  Is it going to hurt to sit down?  No, but it's...  Is your bottom sore? 
[02:23:00]  See, why isn't your mic on?  Yeah, it stings.  It stings.  Just keep Jimmy's mic on.  It stings.  That's a banana phone.  Why isn't his mic on?  It is on.  They're all on.  Yeah.  All right.  So, there.  I did the news and I got stings.  Yeah, no, that's the one he usually is.  Do I get brownie points for this?  Wow.  You certainly do.  You are a hero.  Oh, he's...  He got me again.  You are a hero.  You want to spank Keith?  No.  Just show the technique a little bit?  You want to spank anyone?  You want to spank Jimmy with the belt?  No.  No?  I'm not into the belts, man. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  If you do it for me, I wouldn't take it.  No.  That's not my thing.  All right.  I'm not particularly submissive.  No.  No.  All right.  Well, we want to get another newscast from you.  Maybe one that has a little more information.  I couldn't concentrate, though.  Geez, you're critiquing her news for being...  I was being spanked.  ...for not being that informative.  She was being spanked, don't you?  I like Anthony.  He was spanked up for me.  I like Dee Dee a lot.  I think she adds a lot to the show.  She cries like Cronkite during the Kennedy reading, but for different reasons. 
[02:24:00]  President.  I still can't get another...  He's dead.  No, it's sting.  It's sting.  It doesn't sting, okay?  It's sting.  At least I'll never pee on anybody.  Where are you from?  Again, I forgot.  Juliet, which is a suburb of Chicago.  A suburb of Chicago.  And they say, instead of sting, they say stingy.  You should hear my mom.  We should get her on the phone.  Ask her a polo sausage.  The way she says sausage.  She goes, sausage.  We're having polo sausages and sauerkraut.  Get her on the phone.  Okay.  Banana food.  Oh, my God.  You know what? 
[02:24:30]  What?  Because she's like, you're going to be on with that dirty show again.  The dirty show.  The dirty show.  Oh, that's fun.  Let's talk to her after the break.  Yeah, I definitely want to hear the accent.  Yeah, Chicago.  Ask her Polish what?  Polish sausage?  We'll be asking her a lot of things.  We'll say we're doing a cooking show or something like that.  We'll talk about cooking or something like that.  On this dirty show.  We'll just talk about cooking and stuff.  I've got to have a donut or something.  All right.  Why don't we take a break so we get more food in our faces?  Is your butt still stinging?  Yes, but don't tell her that.  No, we would never do that. 
[02:25:00]  Of course not.  Not this show.  No, we're just going to ask her to say Polish sausage.  We know where the line is.  We always have.  Jesus.  No, we're not bringing that up.  Have some faith in us.  That's embarrassing.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  That's good, though.  Also.  You did a very good job on the news, Dee Dee.  Pad O'Brien audio.  Yeah, we're going to do the Pad O'Brien audio next.  Dee Dee, what do you think about getting spanked while your mom's on the phone?  No!  No!  Okay, we can't.  She's like, you know.  Yeah.  Nice old Midwest lady.  Right.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  This is the heartland of the country.  Holy S. 
[02:25:30]  Don't you have a train to take back to New York?  Show wrecker?  Show wrecker.  God.  Wow.  Anyway, we're going to take a break.  We'll do the Pad O'Brien audio next.  I'm going to go punch someone in the face.  I don't want to get punched.  Opie.  It steams.  And there was something else we were going to get to.  I've forgotten that.  That would steams.  That we'll figure it out after the break.  It steams.  Like sand through the hourglass.  So is the O&A virus. 
[02:26:00]  By the way, what happened with you and Gene Simmons?  Oh, that asshole.  All I know is I was getting phone calls all night long from you, Ben.  Ben laughing his ass off.  Really?  That's surprising.  I have genes.  That's what?  Gene blew off.  What happened?  Gene Simmons.  I just had him on the show, what, a week ago?  Two weeks ago?  I'm in the bathroom.  All right, granted, that's a little bit creepy.  I'm in the bathroom, and I see him, and he walks in the men's room at the Venetian.  So he walks by.  I go, hey, Gene.  And he goes, hello.  And of course, he doesn't look. 
[02:26:30]  He just keeps going straight.  Again, he's a rock star.  I don't blame him.  I wouldn't look at me either in the men's room.  I decide to wait outside and say hello real quick.  And his security notices me kind of lurking there with Steve.  So Gene walks out, and I'm like, hey, man, I'm on the Opie and Anthony show.  You just called in last week.  And he's like, all right.  And he just won't even look.  He just walks right by.  Wow.  Steve, were you there when he got blown off by Gene Simmons?  Yeah, we both did.  We both got totally, totally blown off in a really kind of...  I forgot. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, you did.  Oops.  It was just...  But like Jimmy said, he's walking into the bathroom.  I was the first one out.  I said, oh, hey, Gene Simmons.  He said, oh, hi, how you doing?  And as Jimmy came out, we waited.  We were going to talk to him.  And it was just so goddamn dismissive and condescending.  And we totally explained who we were, exactly who we were.  Mentioned the fact that he was on the show.  We just wanted to talk to him.  And his response was, that's nice.  Nice for you. 
[02:27:30]  I have to go.  And then he had to leave.  And he goes, oh, I'll be an empty.  I might see those guys later.  And I'm like, all right, can I just get a quick picture with you?  He's like, no, I'm really running late.  He goes, you can walk with me if you want.  So I started walking with him to get the picture.  And then Yoshi is just backing up and like trying to take...  All he had to do was stop for one second.  And he wouldn't stop or look at me.  So fuck you, Gene.  Oh, hey, relax.  Oh, that really annoyed me.  That really annoyed me.  He was one of your heroes growing up.  He was one of my heroes growing up. 
[02:28:00]  When you were Jimmy Robinson.  Sorry, I wasn't hawking a kiss keychain, motherfucker.  It wasn't just the setup to maybe coddle you a little later.  Oh, did he annoy me.  Every bit of loyalty I had for him went out the window.  And I wanted to spit on him.  I was so aggravated.  How many bad people bashed him, called in, trashing him.  And like an asshole, I defended him.  You did.  Time and time again.  And he doesn't need me to defend him.  He's a billionaire.  It's not going to change.  But it just really, really annoys me.  Look, I'm not anywhere near that level of fame, but I've taken enough fan pictures to know that you can stop for one second. 
[02:28:30]  A second.  Disinterested shithead.  Wow.  Six foot three in your dark Undertaker suit.  That stupid straight ahead look on your face.  We get it.  You're a genius.  We get it.  You have really turned.  Oh, did I, I can't tell you.  That's a lousy picture.  I am so tired.  Yeah, but you know what?  It was, Steve was right.  I understood he was busy and he had to leave.  I didn't expect a 40 minute photo shoot. 
[02:29:00]  But he knew that we were talking about being on the show and we're members of the show.  And he could have just stopped for one second and taken that picture.  He just, he didn't give a shit.  Right.  Sorry, I didn't have anything to sell for you.  That's what it was.  It wasn't advantageous to him to stop for a second.  There was nothing in it for him, for him to stop, Jimmy.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Our duties do have destructive power.  You think it stinks now?  You should have seen it a month ago. 
[02:29:30]  Kirby and Anthony show live from Washington, D.C.  All right, what are we doing now?  Oh.  Is my mic working?  There, that's better.  See, I could be adjusting all the levels.  It was a little odd.  That would be fun to adjust levels and push my own buttons, but.  Eh, no buttons.  No biggie.  They've changed something on my mic, though. 
[02:30:00]  I saw him doing something during a commercial.  Yeah.  During our little break.  Now I'm fine, I think.  I hope.  Smile.  Smile.  Ooh.  A reporter.  Actually, a photographer.  He could be.  No, he's probably just the photographer for the Washington Times, right?  Washington Times.  The Jimmy Olsen.  Was Jimmy Olsen your hero when you watched Superman?  Most people, Superman was like the hero.  But he was like, God, that Jimmy Olsen's got a great job.  Just runs around and snaps pictures for a newspaper. 
[02:30:30]  He's the young go-getter.  The young go-getter.  I'll go with you, Lois.  He's that guy.  Any famous pictures that you took that we might know?  That's definitely not.  No?  Not one of those, you know, I was there, Iwo Jima, something like that?  No?  Nothing?  All right.  Oh, Opie, you're putting your middle finger up.  He likes it, though.  That's terrible.  He's snapping away.  They can't post that.  Why not?  Because.  All right, we got Dee Dee back in the studio.  She's the hero of the show today. 
[02:31:00]  We love Dee Dee.  We do love Dee Dee.  Dee Dee is the best part about Washington.  Huh?  I said, you guys are great, too.  I love you guys, too.  Aw, thank you, Dee Dee.  Bruce Kelly is downright annoying.  We like you, though.  Bruce Kelly comes in.  You know what the one thing I don't like about you, though?  Oh, shit.  You wait until we ask you to come into the studio.  Because.  See, Bruce just barges in and sits down, and, you know, we're in the middle of a conversation,  and he's just all of a sudden sitting next to me as I'm looking at Jimmy, you know, out of my peripheral, I see him. 
[02:31:30]  Waiting for us to acknowledge him.  Yes, we see you, Bruce.  Well, I didn't want to finish the office.  We see you in your Valium voice.  I like that.  I saw, Ovi, you couldn't hide it.  It was such a quick glance.  It was, I think it was almost like the, was it Tattaglia, the glance that he gave before Luca Brasi got the knife in the hand and choked, or was it Barzini?  That was a young Tattaglia.  Yeah.  It was Bruno, right?  Bruno Tattaglia.  Bruno Tattaglia. 
[02:32:00]  Remember when Luca Brasi's talking, and he's looking at Luca, and then Luca looks down for a second, and Barzini looks at the Turk and just go, like, you knew it was kill him.  Just kill him.  And then he looked back up, Luca looked back up, and he was smiling already.  It was a split-second face.  Opie's face.  Nailed it.  Right when Bruce sat down, Opie looks over at Bruce and looks at me, and it was that kill him face.  And then he smiled again.  You picture Opie doing this to his hand. 
[02:32:30]  Patting his hand, and then just smashing it down and putting a knife through it.  It's not that I don't like the guy.  Of course not.  He just has a much different delivery than what we do.  And there are times.  I mean, he works on the 80s channel.  Jesus, do some coke before you get in here.  Wake the fuck up.  Be one with your decade.  Do some blow.  Be one with the show you're attempting to sabotage.  And most people would, you know, wait until maybe we're doing something that concerns you 
[02:33:00]  or involves you to come into the studio and sit down.  Wait for Ben to go, hey, we need you in here.  Come on in.  I went into panic mode because I knew the Aussie story was going to have a great finish.  Uh-huh.  You know, the rest of it was pretty much like kind of a setup with some cue lines and observations.  Fun conversation.  But I knew where the whole thing was going to the hooker story.  Right.  And he sits down right in the middle of that.  And you know how that is in radio.  Oh, my God.  That's all it takes to just destroy something that you know is going to work out just fine.  The distraction.  Yeah.  It's that distraction. 
[02:33:30]  We're having a three-way conversation here, talking.  Let's say we're at the bar hanging out, right?  And we're having a conversation.  Jimmy's telling us a story.  We're just hanging out there.  And some guy walks up and just walks into your conversation circle.  Wouldn't you, all of a sudden, you wouldn't just keep telling the story because it would be a little distracting.  Same thing.  So, next time, just walk in.  Sit down in front of everybody during the story.  He did get the hint, though.  He's not around anymore.  Sir, could you take my picture, too?  Pound that hint home. 
[02:34:00]  He just laughed at you.  Look at him.  Oh, Jimmy, put your shirt down.  Jesus.  I know.  He puts his picture shirt up and starts scratching his belly.  Like an animal.  You are an animal.  I've got to break into this fascinating conversation because we've got Dee Dee's mom on the phone.  Oh, wow.  From Chicago?  Joliet, suburb of Chicago.  Joliet, isn't that where that famous prison is?  Yep, Joliet.  What's that?  The Blues Brothers.  The Blues Brothers.  Steve, I don't read lips.  Steve is saying no, no, no.  That's all I could tell because he had the international sign of no, no, no.  What's up? 
[02:34:30]  No, the note I just passed you said the line was busy, so we're working on it.  Oh, Dee Dee's mom's line is busy.  I should have read the note.  She shouldn't be busy.  They have colleagues.  Uh-oh.  Maybe they're online?  They have a dial-up connection?  No, they're too old for that stuff.  Oh, really?  You have parents that don't do the internet?  Yes, 744.  They don't know what I just said.  No, of course not.  None of our listeners have ears.  I don't read the whole number.  Believe me.  If they had ears, they would know this show stinks.  What? 
[02:35:00]  I had a thought and I realized it would have been a cohesive thought, so I just kind of cut it off.  You just panicked because now they're taking your picture of the Washington Times.  I didn't even know.  They're not taking my picture.  He's photographing the machine.  He's photographing the instant replay machine and the beverage.  Is that going to be in the paper?  What is this for?  Is there a story accompanying this?  I guess.  Or is it just a picture?  Another dumb interview with the same questions.  Do we have an interview to do after the show?  Oh, that's the guy?  Oops.  I mean, another great interview.  I'm not going in. 
[02:35:30]  I'm not going in there.  Look, he's shaking his head.  No.  Why don't you guys do something weird for the picture, though?  Like, you want to get him to do something odd?  Like, maybe, like, sit together and, like, one is, like, you know what I mean?  They like to do, like, weird stuff during a photo.  Shut up.  I think you guys should have seen it funny.  Shut up.  Like, maybe both talking into the same microphone and fighting over the same microphone?  You know, your ideas are not even too far-fetched for what we've been asked to do like that.  Ben forgot the oversized shirt that we usually wear together, so. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, we get a giant shirt and both get in it, and I put one arm through one sleeve, he  puts the other in the other sleeve, and we're like the two-headed radio monster guy.  The best part is we both try to fight our way out of the shirt.  Yeah.  Makes us look all zany.  How about you both sharing one set of headphones?  Like, maybe both of your heads are together, and there's one big set over your left ear?  One big set of headphones, and our ears and cheeks are touching together?  Yeah.  That'll happen in some far-fetched, bizarro land.  Jesus Christ.  How about you bring Terry Chavo in here, and they're both teabagging her at the same time 
[02:36:30]  in the middle of the courtroom?  That's not nice.  Can I not offer a suggestion about what's going on?  It's just a suggestion.  It's just a wacky suggestion.  What's wrong with that?  Isn't that awful, Dee Dee?  There's no need to make light of that situation.  Jimmy, you always take me too far.  What?  She wouldn't know what's going on.  Yeah, what does she care for?  What?  What her family members do?  What if her friends are listening to you right now?  They might be listening to you.  They'll be like, wow, Norton's a real douchebag.  They know what filth we are before this program started today. 
[02:37:00]  That's true.  They're not going to be shocked.  They're fans of this show.  If they're fans of this show, they probably go into the hospital room at night and put pins  in her toes saying, look, see?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Creeps.  Only creeps listen to this program.  Or if they eat something that's bad, like, ah, it tastes awful, they just put it in her  mouth.  Go, try this.  Try this.  Look, it must be good.  She's not going, ugh.  Not doing anything.  It's wrong.  It is wrong.  It really is wrong, Dee Dee.  Where's your mom? 
[02:37:30]  They're trying to get her.  I guess the light is busy for some reason.  Is she yapping to somebody?  Does she yap a lot on the phone?  Does she have XR?  She has nine kids, so of course.  Wow, nine kids?  You have nine siblings?  I'm the youngest of nine.  The youngest of nine.  How many different dads?  No, one dad.  One dad.  Well, we adopted a family of four, so.  Wow, the whole family?  Mother, father, kids, everything?  Not the mother.  Oh, what?  I was the last of five she had, then we adopted four more.  You adopted four kids on top of five kids?  Because at first we had two foster, found out there were two more, and my mom and dad didn't 
[02:38:00]  feel that families should be split up.  Split up.  So they did the right thing.  What a nice thing to do.  Are they good kids?  Some of us were fuck-ups.  Yeah, us?  Hence the reason that you want to beat up people.  Are you one of the kids getting a little aggression out from your childhood?  I'm the last one my mom had.  I'm the last answer that my mom had.  And then the adopted ones are older than you?  Yes.  I'm the youngest out of everybody.  All right.  And are they good, though?  For the most part, we've had a couple that, you know. 
[02:38:30]  You know what happens if they start to screw up?  You say to them, you know, some children are born, but you were born from our hearts.  Some children are born from their mother's tummy, but you're special because you were  born from mommy's heart.  Like a big cholesterol bubble.  No, but we're all fine now.  It's just like growing up.  Some of us are bad.  All right.  Well, if you get Dee Dee's mom on the phone, we'll go right to Dee Dee's mom.  Can I ask how much older were they than you? 
[02:39:00]  The oldest is 10 years old.  Michelle's a year older, so everybody's like within a year apart.  What are their names?  Oh, my God.  The four adopted only.  Oh, they're four.  Michelle, Carrie, Eddie, and Johnny.  How old are Eddie and Johnny?  Johnny just turned 40.  How much older than you?  I'm 36, so...  Oh, okay.  For you, yeah.  Wait, you're trying to get something going that maybe there was some inappropriate touching,  Jimmy?  Just a curiosity.  Just a curiosity is all it was.  Did he ever wrestle with you?  Johnny?  Yeah.  No?  No?  No wrestling? 
[02:39:30]  No wrestling with your little sister.  What's wrong with that?  Who hasn't done that?  No, Michelle and I always fought a lot, though.  Yeah?  The one that's a year older than me.  The boys never pinned you down and tried to spit in your face?  No.  Nothing like that?  Who would discipline you when you were younger if you were bad?  Both parents.  For me, it was more my dad.  And you got spankings, right?  A lot of discipline in your family growing up?  They used...  Okay.  All right, we got Didi's mom on the phone.  Oh, we do.  We'll have that.  Why don't you ask her about...  Yeah.  All right, we'll ask her some stuff.  Didi's mom.  Hello?  Didi's mom?  Yes, it is.  Hey, mom.  Hi, how are you? 
[02:40:00]  I'm fine.  First of all, I'd love to say you have a wonderful daughter.  We love Didi.  But, of course.  She's very funny.  She's got great personality, cute as a button, and we love having her on the show.  Do you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  No, not yet.  I'm sorry, but we will soon.  No.  You know something?  It might be better if you avoid the channel.  But you did tell Didi that that's that dirty show.  Uh-oh.  Ah.  So you do know about the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:40:30]  You're familiar with the program.  What have you heard about the Opie and Anthony show?  Now, I heard good things, but on the wrong side of the track.  All right?  Yeah.  Okay, so she's familiar with what we do without actually listening to the program, which is fine.  Yes, yes.  Right.  That's good.  Are you very proud of your daughter?  Yes, I am.  She's worked very hard for everything she's gotten.  Is she like the star of the family?  No, we've got nine stars in our family.  Yeah?  Ah.  What a great diplomatic thing to say. 
[02:41:00]  I don't know who else is listening in, all right?  But she's kind of a celebrity, though.  Yes, she is.  She's on the radio, so that's kind of cool.  In certain circles, she is, yes.  Mm-hmm.  Do you know what your daughter does when she's not doing radio?  Well, no, not really.  Not all the time, no.  She's got a great personality and maybe a couple of quirks.  I don't know.  Hey, we were talking about discipline as she was growing up. 
[02:41:30]  Was she a tough child?  She was stubborn.  Stubborn.  Yes.  Like a lot of girls growing up.  Well, she had to keep up with the eight before her, see.  Yeah.  Are you an old-school mom where you would spank your children?  Like, I mean, I could admit it on the show.  I used to get spanked as a kid.  I respect that.  Yeah, I did, too.  I got the wooden spoon a few times in my life.  Yeah, but the best thing that worked with her is to put her up against the wall and have  her nose hit a circle I had drawn on the wall.  Wait, you drew a circle on the wall?  Uh-huh. 
[02:42:00]  And made her stand there and put her nose in the circle?  Right.  And she would have to stand there for about how long?  Well, she'd stand there next to her sister because they were always fighting until they  started laughing and then it was all over.  Yeah.  That's kind of funny.  You know, my dad used to make me go in the backyard and pick out my own stick to get beat  with.  Oh.  A switch?  Uh-huh.  And I always had some kind of a sense of humor, so I would always come back with a little  twig and then they would start laughing uncontrollably and then they forgot that they had  to beat the shit out of me. 
[02:42:30]  It was great.  Watch your language.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Dee Dee's mom.  His mother's on the other line.  I'm sorry.  I think you could curb the dirty language for a couple of minutes.  I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry, Dee Dee's mommy.  And so whenever you had to discipline her physically, would you use something?  My hand.  Just your hand.  Generally.  And spank her bottom.  Generally.  Yeah.  Good bottom right.  Yeah, we weren't the Partridge family, believe me.  No.  You do realize you set her down a path, right? 
[02:43:00]  No.  They always say it goes back to your childhood, Anthony.  No.  I know where you're going with that.  No, that's not that.  No.  Because there's usually something that stems from childhood that explains an adult's, I  don't know, preferences in certain situations, let's say.  And we've learned here today that Dee Dee, in certain situations, let's just say, enjoys...  Those certain situations could be after a bunch of cocktails, maybe. 
[02:43:30]  Maybe.  And maybe when she's with a significant other, let's just say, in a private moment, there  are certain things that she enjoys that maybe can be traced back to her being disciplined  as a childhood.  Maybe with a hand or a paddle or a belt or clips or a whip.  I think not.  No, you think not?  I think not, guys.  No.  She tends to misbehave on purpose. 
[02:44:00]  Poor mother.  Get her to say that.  Yeah.  We will when we're done talking to...  Yeah, you don't really believe that she's really into spankings and whippings, right?  No, not really.  Your daughter would never actually whip someone with the whipsy butt.  Oh, never, never, never.  Of course not.  It's just a deco item.  Yeah, something like that.  If you had a riding crop laying around the house...  Right.  It would never be used to, you know, have somebody spank your bottom with it.  Never.  For pleasure.  Right.  Even though it steams. 
[02:44:30]  You're talking about my little baby.  I understand.  Yes.  You're a little girl.  Yes.  We like her very much.  I'm glad you do.  We do, too.  Does anyone else in the family have a voice like hers?  Oh, I thought you meant a fetish like hers.  Oh, no.  Anybody else get Marquis to sign for Christmas?  No.  She's the only one there.  Yeah, the only one with that little voice.  And she always had that voice, even as a kid?  Yes, she has the gift, yes.  Yeah, never. 
[02:45:00]  Has her voice changed?  Or was it like that when she was a kid, and then it just stayed that way?  Or was it even more cartoon-like as a child?  Probably has matured with age.  Yeah.  So have some of her tastes in the bedroom.  Dee Dee, would you like to say something to your mom?  Yes, Deanna, would you?  No.  Deanna.  I'm just hanging here with the guys.  Do you have...  She's giving us a really dirty look.  She just gave you the Bruno Tattaglia look.  I saw that.  Dee Dee's mom, do you have XM Satellite Radio? 
[02:45:30]  No, not yet.  Well, you know what?  You can listen to the program online, and you know what?  Right after this show, it repeats.  Oh, yeah.  And Dee Dee did such a great job on our program today.  I think you really need to listen to the replay today.  She was reading the news.  Yes.  And getting spanked while she was doing it.  Oh, goodness.  That was interesting, huh?  Yeah, it really was.  When one is naughty, one must be disciplined, even in the middle of the newscast.  Deanna, Dee Dee, what do you have to say for yourself? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, Dee Dee.  Yeah, Dee Dee.  I was just going along with what they wanted me to do.  Just going along.  We told you not to be a follower, be a leader.  You weren't raised that way.  Well, she needs to follow you.  She is a leader, too.  Trust me.  Yeah, she can lead or follow.  It's called a switch.  Followers end up in Joliet.  That's right.  Getting spanked by other bigger men.  Now, I think you know that Dee Dee is a very, very, she's a pretty assertive person,  and she's not much of a follower. 
[02:46:30]  She pretty much does what she wants to do.  Yeah, she's quite a leader.  I think she likes having the crop in her hands sometimes.  She likes to grab the bull by the clamps.  Uh-oh.  But she's not into CBT.  No, she doesn't like the CBT, which I will not tell you what that is.  No GSBS, but I mean, she's definitely no CBT.  She's actually a very nice girl.  But she does enjoy the clamps on certain areas.  Yeah.  That's my mother.  Would you like to tell your mom, or do we have to?  No. 
[02:47:00]  I really don't want to tell your mom that you're into Nip-A-Clash.  You know, it's radio.  That would really be bad.  Mom, did you ever search through her room or anything?  Did you ever find anything that you went, oh, brother?  No.  Maybe once.  Dee Dee's making a face like, I think so.  I never found anything.  Never found anything?  Your mom's a snooper.  She knew stuff was around.  Did you keep a diary, Dee Dee?  No.  No?  I'm not into that.  Not into diaries or anything like that?  No photographs around that might have been incriminating that mom could have seen? 
[02:47:30]  No.  No, she knew how to hide things pretty good.  Books or magazines.  I had eight people in front of me.  I learned all the tricks.  Yeah, you learned all the tricks.  Very good.  Hey, Mom, do you have a little kink to you?  Oh, it's my mother.  Dee, you were the one who said that everyone has a kink.  I'm just trying out your philosophy.  No kinks.  I have a TV personality, a family I really appreciate.  Ah, see?  The King of the Hill, you ever watch it?  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, that's my role model right now, that family. 
[02:48:00]  That family?  Wow.  They're the average American family.  That is pretty screwy.  And it's interesting you picked a cartoon having a daughter that sounds like a cartoon character.  I thought you would pick the Simpsons.  She sounds like Lisa Simpson.  No, no, no.  And why isn't she on the Cartoon Network?  I don't know.  You really should send a tape into the Cartoon Network.  Why is my daughter being spanked?  Oh, God.  Dee Dee, why don't you just admit it to your mom?  Then you'll have an open relationship with her. 
[02:48:30]  Okay, Deanna, what do you have to say for yourself?  Just admit it.  She said my role model.  Deanna.  Dee Dee.  Just admit it.  Your mom wants to know.  Be free and open.  I have nothing to admit.  My mom.  You know her safe word is green?  That's my favorite.  You know what a safe word is, Mom?  Uh-uh.  Let's say Dee Dee was with a significant other and she's.  All right, all right.  Okay, okay, guys.  Yes.  It's one of those.  Green has always been her favorite word.  It's one of those words to make someone stop.  Yes. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, you know.  Oh, boy.  She doesn't sound very happy about that.  Yeah.  It's not bad.  I think Dee Dee's mom is misinterpreting.  It's not a bad thing.  It's not a dirty or awful thing.  Oh, my God.  She's misinterpreting it.  It's not bad.  Yeah, well, Dee Dee was shocked at what Jim Norton does during his spare time.  She's giving us another look, Mom, but, you know.  Would you like to know what Norton does in his spare time?  Uh, maybe I shouldn't.  No, it's...  Wait, what word...  Hold on.  I'm a mother.  What word did you want your mom to say?  Because we were kind of... 
[02:49:30]  We like the Midwestern accent.  It's so different than our East Coast.  What was the word that you wanted her to say?  That she cooks or something?  What's that?  Yeah.  She's been easier about it all the time.  What do you have with sauerkraut?  Sausage.  Right.  Sausage.  Have you ever been cooking and a sausage falls off and lands on someone's chest?  No.  Of course not.  That would be silly.  That's right.  No one has sausage falling on their chest.  Never.  Oh, my God.  It would probably burn because it's served hot. 
[02:50:00]  I know.  I'm getting hot.  You might have to take a sausage off your chest and write a check.  Hey, Dee Dee, are you being held captive?  No.  I'm sorry.  Why are you there on your free will?  She couldn't possibly be here under her own power.  I understand.  Well, Mom is great.  And we love Dee Dee.  Do we get to hear your mom?  My mom they've heard, yes.  And my mom.  We've heard them on the air also.  We've put them on.  Yeah, if I could get my mom out of the attic, I would get her on the radio. 
[02:50:30]  My mom likes singing, if you can call it that.  Well, then you should have a program of just moms someday.  Maybe for Mother's Day.  We'll do that wacky radio bit.  The mom show.  Right.  There you go.  All right.  We could tell all the little secrets of our little young'uns.  Dee Dee?  Yes.  Anything else you want to tell your mom that you do?  I love you, Mom.  I love you, too, hon.  Dee Dee, how's your ass?  Is it getting better?  It's steam.  Look!  Oh, guys, guys, you've got to go to confession. 
[02:51:00]  Why?  What happened?  Well, we tell her.  Confess our sins.  No.  All right.  Dee Dee, say goodbye to your mom.  We have a break to do here.  I love you, Mom.  I love you, too, guys.  Okay.  Bye, Dee Dee's mom.  Bye!  Who was that?  Dee Dee's mom?  Yes.  Listen to this.  Bye!  Bye!  She didn't hear it.  She didn't hear it.  No, but she heard your voice go three octaves higher.  Bye!  She's not stupid.  What a nice mommy.  Very nice. 
[02:51:30]  She's a wonderful Midwest mom.  That's a very sweet mom.  All right.  Very accepting of new ideas and new things and discovering things every day about her children.  She has eight phone calls to make right now.  They don't have a computer, so I'm safe.  You're safe, yeah.  I'm safe.  Nothing online going on over there, right?  Hey, Anthony, what's going on with the scratch tickets in New York?  Should we take a break, then?  Yeah?  You want a break?  All right, while we take a break, we do have a few more news stories to get to.  We've got to talk about that, but I think Eric is going to be entitled to some cash 
[02:52:00]  because he had a winning ticket also.  Oh, that's right.  And I hear there's a settlement in the offering, and we'll see how much money Eric's going to have.  He might just leave the show.  He had, what, a $100,000 winner?  Yeah.  He could leave the show with this settlement.  Well, it's the scratch ticket update that's a huge controversy back in New York.  Also, we want to talk about the guy on that flight.  We didn't get to that story yesterday.  And Pat O'Brien, right?  Yeah, Pat O'Brien Audio.  And DeeDee, can you do another newscast for us?  I'm not going to get spanked. 
[02:52:30]  No, you don't have to.  No, you can do it regular.  This isn't a show where we run things into the ground, trust me.  Oh, really?  We know when to stop things at 11 o'clock.  Yeah, exactly.  Can you do a better newscast, though?  Get maybe some other stories, entertainment news, maybe a Jacko update?  Sure, Jacko update.  All right, as soon as your news is ready, we'll go to you, okay?  Okay.  All right, but first, it's a little break.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton? 
[02:53:00]  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What's going against the wall?  I'm not going to give you a deal. 
[02:53:30]  I'm a diva.  I'm a Starbucks coffee man.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  What makes bad kids mad?  What makes them do the things they do?  Here we come.  Five.  That's right.  From Cracktown, USA.  This is drunk.  Deep in the heart of Washington, D.C.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Both drive safely.  Unquote.  Isn't that lovely? 
[02:54:00]  Let's make a party out of it.  Right.  The Anthony and Anthony Show.  I got to show you.  All right. 
[02:54:30]  You pulled your pants up and pushed your stomach out and just walked around like a big dummy  in the studio.  That was a perfectly accurate one.  Broadcasting live from the XM Satellite Radio compound in Washington, D.C.  This show started off quite rough, but I think it's been a pretty good show so far.  No, Ant?  Started as a disaster in the making.  A complete disaster.  I'm having a damn good time today.  Yeah, definitely.  And then we go into meetings.  Well, this is the week before vacation, too, so we're always a little squirrely, always 
[02:55:00]  a little just like, just can't wait to get out of here for a week or two and recharge  the batteries.  Ben told me it was nothing but a tech meeting today.  No promotions, crap, or this, that.  This is all about what are the problems in New York.  We're going to sit with the guys, write it all down on the window, and whatever problem  you have technically, think of them now.  Well, the other thing we have to do, right after the show, we have to intro all the worst 
[02:55:30]  of bits.  Oh, we're doing that, too?  Yeah, we're doing something a little different, because we have, you know, the faithful listeners,  they listen to every second of everything we do, so we're going to try to give them some  new material, so we're introing a lot of the bits you're going to be hearing when we're  away.  This is like the extras on a DVD.  Yeah, we're trying.  Isn't it?  I don't know.  I hope someone out there is getting into the 6 a.m. hour, because we're having a lot of  fun with that.  Yeah.  We're really messing with time, basically.  Adding a little extras in, sure.  It's fun, because the 6 a.m. hour now is kind of, you know, an hour of best, though, but  Anthony and I pop in and intro stuff, and we've been having a lot of fun with that. 
[02:56:00]  And then are we set for the second day in Boston yet, Ben?  Yeah, we're going to just finalize that today, but yeah, we're going to do that.  All right, because when we get back from vacation, April 11th, our first live broadcast off the  premium and all that is going to be live from Boston at Bill's Bar.  You know, it's opening day for the Sox.  They're playing the Yanks.  It's going to just be an all-out party.  I was reading some of the message boards.  People are figuring out how to road trip from great distances.  Yeah, I heard from Buffalo.  I saw the Buffalo one. 
[02:56:30]  Philly, yeah.  They're getting carpools together to meet us at Bill's Bar, which is on Lansdowne Street  behind the Green Monster.  And the broadcast is going to be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. East Coast time.  And then we go to watch the game and then watch the Red Sox beat the Yankees.  So we'll stay in Boston.  We'll do another broadcast the next night.  It's a new season, my friend.  And then, well, yeah, that's where it's going to get confusing, but it'll be on the websites  and we'll be running promos.  The second day, we'll go back to mornings.  It'll be kind of like a hangover show with coffee, donuts for all our listeners.  It'll be fun.  I'm sick of you of all the Red Sox stuff that's out now. 
[02:57:00]  They've got this guy.  Stephen King writes his book.  There's all kinds of books.  And now this goddamn movie that's out with Jimmy Fallon.  And Drew Barrymore.  And Drew Barrymore.  What's it about?  A guy cop and a cab driver?  No, this is about a Red Sox fan whose name is Ben, by the way.  Is it?  He plays a guy named Ben.  There's probably going to be great clips we could get for that to play on the show.  The guy's Ben, and he's just a hardcore Red Sox fan.  It's Jimmy Fallon.  And, of course, he falls in love with Drew Barrymore. 
[02:57:30]  And the conflict between his love for the Sox and the love for Drew, that's the movie.  And we're going to be in Boston for the premiere of that movie.  Yeah, that premiere's going on while we're up there, too.  And we're going to have Lenny Clark on, most likely, who's in the movie.  Yeah, they're all those guys.  Except for those.  Yeah, they're all of them.  Is L.B. in it?  Probably.  L.B.'s probably in it, too.  Who's L.B.?  Best scene ever with the Byers.  From the Bees.  Oh, man.  He's a good friend of ours.  The best is Cam Neely in the stall in Dumb and Dumber. 
[02:58:00]  When he comes in, what was his name?  Oh, yeah, Cam Neely's in there.  Seabass.  Yeah.  Seabass, right.  If you want some lovin', show up here and fun.  There were movies filmed in Boston.  All the regular characters come out of the woodwork.  Yep.  Where else?  Goddamn Red Sox.  So much attention.  There's a lot of Red Sox hats here in Washington.  You know what's that?  Ah.  Yeah, look.  There's another guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that the one we wrecked?  Yeah, that's his Boston hat we destroyed when we were up here.  What's your name again, bro?  Jerry.  We've only met a hundred times.  I'm sorry.  I don't really know you.  Well, I used to work in Boston when you guys were there. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, yeah?  And when you guys were here for a promo, you guys desecrated my Red Sox hat, and then they  won the series.  I put Go Yankees on there and probably jinxed the whole team.  You put Billy Buckner or something.  Yeah, well, I used the B on the hat.  Oh, that's right.  The big Boston B as the first letter in Billy.  So I wrote Billy Buckner Rules.  You were supposed to pick me up a new hat in Boston.  That worked.  You never did.  That worked well.  Yeah, keep waiting for that hat.  It'll happen.  By the way, no don't.  It's just danishes.  It's called humoring you. 
[02:59:00]  I mean, it's very bad.  Oh, thank you, son.  All right, there he goes.  Thank you.  Are you going to be Danish, Jimmy?  All right, yeah.  You want some Danish, sweetie?  No, no, thank you.  We have to get the...  I've got to stop at the dot and get Bella Danish.  Hey, do we have the Entertainment Tonight music, or could they play it in New York?  Because you've got to do the Entertainment Tonight voice for the Pat O'Brien story.  Do we have the hack puker voice?  Do we have it, or...  It's beyond puker, isn't it?  What?  That voice that that woman does for one of the entertainment shows, it's just that she...  It's not human.  We're waiting.  We're waiting. 
[02:59:30]  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  Pat O'Brien.  News today on Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien faces his demons of alcohol and checks into a rehab facility.  For years, Pat O'Brien has reported on problems facing Hollywood stars, formerly on Yaxos Hollywood,  more recently on his new show, The Insider.  Now, the former Chicago Spearscaster is facing his own demons. 
[03:00:00]  I've had problems with Yaxos Hollywood.  How many syllables can they cram in a word?  This is a great thing Pat is doing, said long-time old Brian friend and associate one day.  He's finally facing up to something many of us had known was a...  For a long time. 
[03:00:30]  He's facing up to it.  Pat O'Brien.  So he's an alcoholic.  He's an alky, but, Opie, that isn't the whole story.  Apparently, he checked into this rehab facility because he knew...  Are you saying we're going to go inside the story?  Inside the inside story.  Oh, that's not all.  That's not all.  But this story has an even darker skill wide.  It seems Pat's a fear-yucking perv yard. 
[03:01:00]  This guy gets all tanked up and makes phone calls.  And, uh, oops, one of them gets taped.  Now, Pat O'Brien's married, right?  I guess so.  Pat O'Brien married and he was getting drunk,  calling, uh, this woman and trying to work out a threesome with him, his wife, and, uh, and this woman.  Is this 1998?  No, it's not 1998. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, okay.  I just got a little confused.  Pat O'Brien.  It's now.  Oh, Pat O'Brien.  I'm sorry.  It's now.  Yes, I'm really sorry.  I seem to remember something very similar, but maybe, maybe I'm having just that deja vu weird thing that happens to you.  I've never checked into rehab.  Jesus.  1998, huh?  I mean, uh, 2005.  2005.  I'm a little confused.  I mean, 2005.  Oh, yeah.  It says right on USA Today.  March 22nd, 2005.  Right.  Okay.  We'll read the court documents of Anthony,  who settled the case right when this testimony made its scene in court. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, he's got a post and daily news reporter sitting in the courtroom.  Oh, Anthony, is it true that you try to invite other women into your settle?  I'll settle.  Give her whatever she wants.  The reporters, you can leave now.  They're trying to live like a rock star. 
[03:02:30]  Look what happens.  You're such a hero to a lot of people out there.  You know that, right?  A hero.  Were there whips involved?  No, no whips.  I don't need to know, Anthony.  That's your private life.  That was a long time ago, Opie.  Many, many moons ago.  That's right.  I got the DD snore today.  Hey, look at this.  I'm better than Pat.  Pat couldn't close the deal.  All right.  He faces his demons of alcohol, checks into rehab, 
[03:03:00]  and once you check into rehab, everything's fine.  Yeah, that's the thing you do in Hollywood.  You could do the most outrageous crap,  but you just blame it on the alcohol and the drugs.  You go to rehab, and everyone's like, ah!  Yeah.  Wow, that is weird when that door slams.  I know.  It sucks a lot of the thing out.  Anyway, so we have the audio of Pat O'Brien.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  I haven't heard this yet.  This is the beauty of...  Did you tape somebody or no?  I don't know.  Hey, you know something?  It would probably be illegal for us to tape somebody on the phone  because of some FCC rules. 
[03:03:30]  But for some reason, when these tapes get out,  ah, you play them anywhere.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Ah, what's the rule?  Ah, who cares?  This is the beauty of satellite radio.  No one else is going to give you the unedited version, right?  Unedited.  I hear some racy talk from Pat O'Brien.  I like to call it saucy.  Saucy?  Wow.  It's saucy stuff.  I like racy, but saucy...  Racy is dirty.  Saucy is sexy.  Racy involves a black woman.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Saucy.  I'll try that.  Nothing?  Nothing? 
[03:04:00]  This is risque.  Risque is boring.  Saucy.  I like saucy talk.  You take your wine, a little sugar, put in your meat.  You may have to talk 30 to 100 guys one day.  Oh, no.  The showstopper's going to talk again.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, no.  I actually heard the audio this morning.  Uh-huh.  On the way down here, I didn't have a room, so I shared a room with...  You're going to describe the whole scene of going into the room,  turning on the recorder?  I happened to share a room with Steve.  Yeah.  And this morning, I was laying in bed, and Steve was playing the audio on his laptop, 
[03:04:30]  and certain things you just don't want to hear when you're alone in a room with Steve  when you're half asleep.  Oh, did you go...  I absolutely did, because when you hear the beginning of this phone call,  and some of the things he's saying, I thought it was Steve, and it was a little scary.  Highly unlikely, but all right.  Where's your other hand?  Between two pillows.  Those aren't instant replay machines.  All right, Pat O'Brien.  All right, Steve, are we ready for the big exclusive? 
[03:05:00]  We're the only show that can play the unedited version of this.  Now, what if we want to stop this?  Just cue me.  And talk.  We'll point to Steve.  Yeah.  In the old days, I would just stop the tape, Anthony, but, you know.  Point at that cuddly face.  This means stop.  Okay, Jim, thank you.  Fuckin' sexy.  I don't want to fuck in.  Go crazy.  All right.  What are you doing, Steve?  Oh.  Oh, you dicks.  You're just going to screw with them.  You didn't fall for that, did you? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  You just both did the big stupid stops.  Why is the audio five feet behind you?  I don't want to stop like that.  Wow.  Yeah, rewind that, Steve.  God, that was too easy.  And get the Pat O'Brien clip, not the Joaquin Phoenix clip,  up front of the village.  You guys suck.  All right.  It's so far behind you, how are you going to stop it?  With my hand.  Can I interrupt really fast?  Because there's someone on the phone.  You know, can I go to the phone?  Oh, we could try that.  Ooh.  Because this is a very good observation.  Adam in D.C., what's up? 
[03:06:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  Hello?  Adam.  I thought the phones were fixed.  There you go.  Oh, Adam, what's up?  Still the delay.  Hey, you there?  Adam.  Adam.  Hi.  Over.  Over.  Hello?  Yeah, tell us what you wanted to say.  Over.  Hey, you there?  Hey, hey, you there?  Yeah.  Is Fat Jimmy going to eat the whole fucking show today, or what?  I'm not eating at all, stupid.  He's going to eat the whole fucking show.  You've been eating the whole show.  Every time you open that fat mouth of yours, you fucking got food in it. 
[03:06:30]  Every time Jimmy's been talking today, it's been,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I was going to let that...  You got a fucking mule in your mouth when you're talking, you faggot.  I did eat a little bit on the show today.  I was going to let it go.  You know, when this stuff pops up on the phone screens,  I usually look around, because this one says,  does Jim stop eating ever?  And I was going to let it go, but I turn to Jim,  and I see a big, huge Danish ready to go.  A big Danish full of all frosting, icing on top of it.  But it's a Danish from upstairs, which has probably been here for a week, 
[03:07:00]  so I took one bite out of it.  I'm done.  But he's right.  I have to admit, every time I opened my mouth today,  there was something shoveled into it.  Yes.  Just to cover up the anticlimax of my life  after God left the studio yesterday at 11 o'clock.  All right.  Well, why don't we go to the tape?  So this is Pat O'Brien making a drunken phone call to a girl  that he's trying to get in bed with his either girlfriend or his wife.  I don't know if he's really married or whatever.  So let's hear.  Fucking sexy.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  So, um, I don't want to fucking go crazy with you. 
[03:07:30]  To copy this message to another person, press 6.  To delete this message and go to the next, press 7.  To keep the saved message, Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  You are so fucking hot.  And I want to eat you. 
[03:08:00]  I don't want to suck my car.  I want to fuck you.  I don't want my girlfriend to eat you.  You're so fucking hot.  You are fucking hot.  Let's do it.  You are so fucking hot.  Please leave me a voicemail.  Go to the bathroom and leave me a voicemail.  Bye.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  I just got to soak that in.  What an ass.  He left these on a machine. 
[03:08:30]  Hey, uh, could someone get me the address for the insider?  There's a job opening over there.  Oh, my God.  There is no way he's coming back from that.  How can he come back?  And can I say he's awful at talking dirty?  You're so fucking hot.  Fucking hot.  Migs was better at it.  He stinks.  I can smell your liquor breath.  What an ass.  He left that on a machine like this woman isn't, like, on a cell phone? 
[03:09:00]  Did he say, suck my cock?  Oh, yeah.  He said he wanted to eat her and wanted her to suck his cock.  And then he said, go do the traffic.  Oh, my God.  Is there more?  That's hard to come back from.  Yeah, there's another four minutes of this.  Oh, my God.  I'm hanging.  Let's go.  Guys, great.  Someone says it sounds like Florentine.  Yeah.  Special.  Saved message Sunday, 7, 48 p.m.  And I'm just so fucking into you. 
[03:09:30]  But Betsy's so jealous.  But I'm fucking Amstrak's.  And I want to lick your pussy and suck your tits.  But you have to be into Betsy.  I told Betsy that you were into her.  And if you get this message, just look at me and say yes.  I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you come so much and get crazy. 
[03:10:00]  I don't know why I'm like this, but I don't want you badly.  I know you want me.  But you have to be into Betsy, too.  I don't want to get this message.  I should agree with you, too.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I've heard the worst part is that you should fucking a girl named Betsy.  I wanted to knit a flag and then eat your cunt.  You've got to be with old Betsy. 
[03:10:30]  Dude, your mic is messing up.  I know it is.  That is unbelievable.  That guy is so completely in a froth.  That guy is in a fucking tizzy over this chick.  He's probably like popping Viagra like they're Tic Tacs.  And now he just has a raging heart on him.  This guy cannot control himself.  He's thinking about this.  He can't even keep it in his head.  He's got to call this woman and tell her.  He's imagining licking her and doing it to him. 
[03:11:00]  And he cannot even deal.  How did these tapes get out?  This woman, whoever he left the messages on, saved them all.  Obviously thought it was newsworthy.  But why?  What happened?  Apparently she was flipping through the television one night at 7.30.  And so, hey, wait a minute.  I've talked to him before.  I know this guy.  I think I have some tapes.  Oh, my God.  How old are these tapes?  I don't know.  Any date on them?  Do we have any info on these tapes at all, Steve?  No.  I got sent a link, and that was it.  No background info. 
[03:11:30]  Now, what's the reason that she released these tapes?  Do you know the back story?  We don't really know much about this, huh?  This showed up in the email.  It's just, Pat O'Brien talks dirty, drunk, and coked up.  That was the link I got.  And he said, if you hear this message and you see me just nod and smile.  Yeah.  Is that Mike fading in and out, or no?  It's okay.  No, you're all right.  Okay.  You've got to stay on, Mike, a little more.  Are we the only ones playing these tapes today?  I think so.  Maybe she personally sent it to us.  She's a fan of the show.  I'm sure it's us and Betsy.  We're the ones who are... 
[03:12:00]  Betsy.  You've got to be with Betsy, though.  Yeah.  I called Betsy.  Betsy's so jealous.  Betsy.  I want to lick your pussy.  You heard it here first, folks.  Pat O'Brien facing his demons.  He wants to leah-yuck her puyussi.  You heard a horny Pat O'Brien right here exclusively on the Opium Yatham Yatham Yatham Yatham Yatham show.  Pat O'Brien, that horny fucker.  He just wants to lick her pussy.  He can't even take it.  And then we also heard him say he wants her to shuck his kyaw ark. 
[03:12:30]  He wants to make our chum over and over again  As he licks our pure jussie  He wants to lick her tits  Pat O'Brien, horny old bastard  Can he get Bietzy in on the whole situation?  We'll find out later in the pure jussie  On Inside Edition  He wants to stick his tongue inside her puss 
[03:13:00]  We got more, Steve?  Will Betsy say yes?  Yeah, well, let's see what happens  Maybe it's a whole...  Maybe there's a conclusion to this  Here we go  Save message Sunday, 7, 51 p.m.  It's so fucking hot  I just look at your degree with everything I've said  Just say yes to me  Oh, wait  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you 
[03:13:30]  I'm glad you're nuts  So copy  Save message  He doesn't even know if she's into this or not?  This idiot is just leaving these messages saying  If you agree with this, just wink at me?  Wow  Well, she must work with him or something, right?  What a risk  She's just going to walk down the hall and just give him a nod?  I have a pertinent question in this whole situation  Yes, Anthony?  How are we sure this is Pat O'Brien?  It sounds like him 
[03:14:00]  It does sound like him  We could have a voice, man  I understand...  Oh, no, I will not say it doesn't sound like him  But how are we sure enough to play this as Pat O'Brien?  Not having any confirmation  There's no news  I thought this was attached to a news story  That Pat O'Brien's sex tapes have leaked out  Are we going to be part of a story later today, Steve?  Jesus  Steve, I thought this was part of a story that was out in the news  That these tapes have surfaced  That's why he's in rehab, blah, blah, blah  Hey, we got a huge audience in there all over the country 
[03:14:30]  Hey, guys  Is anyone else playing the Pat O'Brien?  You know, if your morning show is playing him  Phone in, we'd like to hear it  Because right now, I think we're committing some kind of crime  It's actually Pat from Monaki  And the last tape, you're going to hear Pat go  Just blink  Now, you know, hey  I like it as much as the next guy  This is really funny stuff  But are we now alleging that this is Pat O'Brien?  I miss his playing him as well  I miss his playing it? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, but he can't play him like we're playing him  Yeah, I got to edit all the fun stuff out  You can just imagine  A bunch of bleeps and bloops  Right  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Here's Pat O'Brien talking about boop jobs  It stinks  Wish I was on the  Satellite  Satellite, I'm no dummy  Don't talk to me like that  I'm Imus  Yeah, yeah, satellite  You were right  I'm a dick  Boy, I like to eat your pussy

[03:18:30]  On insider host  Pat O'Brien's decision  To enter rehab Sunday?  Hollywood sources  Suggest the timing  Was to diffuse  The release of several  Sexually explicit  Voicemail messages  Available on the internet  Yesterday  Soliciting sex  From an unidentified woman  And then in quotes  Let's just bleeping  Have sex and fun  And drugs  And go crazy  Oh we didn't get to that part  No  Says the male voice  Yesterday's reps  For the insider  Would not comment  On widespread  Attribution of the voice 
[03:19:00]  To O'Brien  The tape describes  In graphic detail  Just how badly  The caller wants  Various activities  That involve  Gosh  All parts of a woman's body  I'm so into you  Betsy is so effing jealous  The voice claims  In one message  You know you want me  But you have to be  With Betsy too  The insider  Host has one child  With his wife  Linda  Hmm  Who's Betsy?  I don't know 
[03:19:30]  Sadly by the final message  Betsy seems to have  Pulled out of the threesome  Oh  They ruined it  They spoiled it  You don't have to say  That part  Yeah but I was reading it  Who's Linda?  Well then I won't read  The last quote  A little spoiler  Oh Anthony  Wow that's something  Alright why don't we  Go back to the tape  Let's uh  Let's continue  With the Pat O'Brien  Messages

[03:26:00]  You know we were saying  You check into rehab  It smooths everything over  But this is a toughie  This is just a horny  Drugged out ass  This isn't one phone call  This is 50 with the same things  Over and over again  Stalking  And he's like  Betsy isn't really into it  And then he goes on  Like a second later  Like you and Betsy  Are going to eat each other  I want to know  What did she do  That gave him a signal  That this is what she wanted  She probably flirted with him once  And said oh my god  Betsy oh my god  What I would do with you two  And then giggled  And walked away  What a good point  What did she say 
[03:26:30]  That warranted this guy  Calling her like a stalker  With filth like this  He misinterpreted something  And just ruined his career  With the signals he's telling her  To give back  It was probably  You know  I saw you go to the copy machine  I saw that  I know what that means  I want to get Betsy  And then just pick up  Jane Mansfield's head  And eat it  Jesus Christ dude  Get all of yourself  Across the desert  And beat you with a shovel  And bury you  We'll have a hooker come over  And she'll want us to eat her pussy  But we won't want to  So she'll give back 50  And then leave the room  It was horrible

Better news  Because obviously  See, there's nothing different going on  Nothing different?  No  I thought we asked you for Michael Jackson  Oh, okay, Michael Jackson  There is something  Michael Jackson  But they won't say who the comedian is  But a comedian is expected to be the first person on the stand 
[03:32:30]  I'm not used to that noise  Today in the Michael Jackson's child molestation trial  It's a female comedian  So who do you think it is, Norton?  I don't know  But I can tell you this  She's awful  Okay  Funny hack  Well, she tried to help Jackson's accuser as he battled cancer  And yesterday Jackson said, you know, he was in a lot of pain  And that's why he was a little late  She isn't engaged to a rich boss, is she?  I don't know  It doesn't say  It won't say who it is  It's just a female comedian  How can I capitalize on this?  We'll be the first there on the stand  Paula Poundstone 
[03:33:00]  No  That would be a really bad  Oh, that would be bad  Touching other girls  And the same stuff about Terry Shivo  You want me to read it again?  Or Mary  Mary Shivo  Terry Shivo  Terry Mary  It's Terry Shivo  I had two lines today  One killed and the other one would have if I had the right name  Mary Shivo  They're waiting just to hear for a full appeal that will happen  It will come later today  And I still think it's wrong  Well, they've got to figure it out, man 
[03:33:30]  She's starving to death right now  Yeah  It'll take a while for her to wither away to nothing  The punch it too back in  They said that you don't suffer when you're in that condition  Oh, really?  Yeah  Is that what they say?  You don't actually starve to death  And how do they know?  Who knows?  I just, I don't know  What do you guys think?  I think she'll smile right to the bitter end  I've heard about  Yeah, if you want me to suck your cock  If you want to suck my cock  Just look at me stupidly and kind of half smile  Oh, my God  Don't do anything  Don't do anything  Yeah, just lay there 
[03:34:00]  I think, I think Bill Hicks had the right idea  Put her in the movies  Yeah  Put her in the movies  Put her in the movies?  Yeah, like as a stunt double or something  Living stunt people  Living stunt double  Makes the stunt look really authentic and they don't care  I'm still trying to find the bit by Bill Hicks  It's brilliant though  Instead of letting your grandma like wither away in the hospital  You put them in an action movie  No?  No  Anyone?  No?  Didi 
[03:34:30]  Didi  Yeah  What do you write?  Okay, he's writing something that distracted me  And then, of course, Demi and Ashton  Oh, right  They want a baby  They want a baby  They want a baby  Is she pregnant?  She's not saying  She won't say yes  She won't say no  She's playing us right now  Yeah  I think she probably is  Yeah  Really?  I want to fuck her  Didi, could you say something?  Just say that  Just say that  Okay, O&A Party Rock  No, you have to say it like you mean it  Like you're yelling at a party  O&A Party Rock 
[03:35:00]  Well, how do you want me to say it?  Because eventually we're going to have an O&A Party Rock sweeper  With all the fun voices on this show  We don't have an example of what it should sound like  For her to listen to  And then to do it  You've got to be really drunk first  And what did you say?  What did you say?  It would be nice if she had an example of somebody saying that in the way it should be said  O&A Party Rock  O&A Party Rock  What's his name?  Okay  O&A Party Rock  Wow, you really dumbed it down 
[03:35:30]  What happened there?  I was trying to be like him  Alright, you're on stage  You're on stage  Close your eyes  You've got the microphone  You have to scream over a thousand crazy O&A fans  How would it sound?  O&A Party Rock  Fucking A  Adding in the fucking A  I like the improv  Sure, why not?  Yeah  Every good actor is an improv  That's all the news you got?
