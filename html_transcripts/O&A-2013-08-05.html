<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Anthony Cumia recounting his ongoing feud with Midtown Tunnel MTA police, detailing multiple instances of what he perceived as harassment leading to traffic tickets. He discussed the absurdity of the situation, speculating on the officers' motivations and considering potential legal action or further pranks.  The conversation veered into tangents about insurance cards, toll booths, and Cumia's recent appearance on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*. A caller shared a humorous anecdote about their father, a former MTA officer and toll collector.

The show then shifted to a discussion of public outrage surrounding celebrities' inappropriate behavior, using Riley Cooper's use of a racial slur as a prime example. The hosts, using highly offensive language, compared the intense backlash Cooper faced to the comparatively lighter consequences for politicians engaging in similar or worse acts.  The conversation expanded to a broader critique of societal hypocrisy, contrasting public fascination with celebrity scandals with outrage over government surveillance.  They discussed Bob Filner's sexual harassment allegations and his attempted defense.  The segment concluded with a discussion of explicit content on social media platforms like Vine, with descriptions of sexually explicit videos, and mention of Lazlo, a Rockstar Games employee, as a recent and expected future guest.  A coworker's cum stain on his shirt was also discussed.

Next, a storyteller recounted their backstage experience at a Black Sabbath concert, detailing encounters with Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, and a more awkward attempt to meet Tony Iommi. Jim Florentine and Troy were present in the studio during this segment.  The conversation segued into a debate about pet ownership, specifically cats versus dogs, with a caller discussing their Bengal cats.  The hosts graphically described the process of declawing cats.  The segment concluded with the showing and insensitive commentary on video clips of a dog with swimmer puppy syndrome and a young cancer survivor at a Cleveland Browns practice, followed by a pornographic video featuring two women, Pepper and Tilly, with crude commentary from the hosts.

The show then moved to a segment mocking a news report about a Zimbabwean man who claimed to have built a helicopter. The hosts repeatedly referred to him as "Flight Lieutenant Zimbabwe," focusing on the apparent flimsiness of the helicopter.  This transitioned into numerous anecdotes about a former employee nicknamed "Master Poe," detailing his incompetence, bizarre behavior, and disastrous attempt at hosting his own show, "Master Poe's Oosh Show," which featured ex-cons.  The hosts presented emails and other evidence, using offensive language, and a caller shared an anecdote about Poe.

The final segment discussed escapism and childhood movies, starting with a caller's experience at a bouncy castle event. This led to a detailed, often explicit, analysis of *Blank Check*, focusing on what the hosts perceived as unsettling sexual tension between the child protagonist and Karen Duffy.  The conversation encompassed other 1990s films like *Heavyweights*, *The Sandlot*, *Agent Cody Banks*, *Milk Money*, *Weird Science*, and *Toys*, with callers sharing their opinions.  Brian Bonsall's later life troubles were also discussed, and the segment concluded with a commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers and mentions of upcoming segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, look at that.  We're finally on the air.  I'm so fucking...  I'm so pissed off.  Man.  That's a great way to start Monday morning. 
[00:01:30]  Glad I checked Twitter.  Well, they got me.  Fucking tunnel rat.  The tunnel rats.  Over at the Midtown Tunnel.  If you recall, I've had kind of a pissing contest going on with them  for a few months now.  I, uh...  A few months back, I was going through and, um... 
[00:02:00]  There was a minivan in front of me.  And, uh...  He stops.  At the toll.  He just stops.  And I saw the gate go up, so I know it wasn't a problem.  But I couldn't see in front of him.  So I go, bam!  I beep him.  You know?  And, uh...  And then the minivan goes through.  And there's one of those fucking tunnel rats standing there.  One of those guys that probably, you know...  Couldn't quite eek through the NYPD Academy.  So, uh... 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, he's standing there.  And, uh...  And then he goes to wave me over.  Now...  Now, if I'm behind somebody.  And the gate goes up.  And I don't see the fucking tunnel rat guy in front of the minivan.  And I beeped at him.  Uh...  You know?  Just take it for what it is.  Kind of put two and two together.  And figure why I was fucking doing that, you know?  But no.  He's gonna try to, like...  Wave me over.  And dress me down.  And give me a little lecture.  For tooting my horn at the guy. 
[00:03:00]  And I wanted no part of it.  So I fucking stepped on the gas.  And fucking...  Blasted through.  Is he actually a cop?  Or is he, uh...  They're technically cops.  Yeah.  Technically.  Right.  So, uh...  You know.  I just fucking went around.  And apparently it hit their message boards.  And all this shit.  And all these fucking bridge and tunnel guys.  Are like, oh!  Bolo!  Bolo!  Be on the lookout!  Bolo!  Bolo!  Ew.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ew.  Be on the lookout! 
[00:03:30]  Anthony Coombe, you're driving a black Escalade!  So for a while I was taking the, uh...  The old Queensborough Bridge.  You know?  Kind of...  Kind of dodging them.  And that worked for a while.  And then I started going back to the tunnel.  Which worked for a while.  I was on the lam from the fucking Midtown Tunnel.  From the MTA police.  Yes.  From the Bridge and Tunnel.  Cops.  And, uh...  Well, this morning, um...  I'm coming through. 
[00:04:00]  And, uh...  And, you know, sometimes I guess they're fucking bored.  So they just stand there looking at everyone's vehicle for what they could pick away at.  And hassle the people that are just going to work in the morning.  Um...  So I pull up to the gate and he just steps in front of me.  He's like,  Go over to that area right there!  Go over to that area!  Because of any reason you didn't signal for that lane change?  Dude.  Who has not, first of all, 
[00:04:30]  in the Toll Plaza area,  changed lanes?  The fucking...  If one line is too long and you look,  you just go into the other lane.  It's kind of a no-man's land over there.  Well, I haven't done it without signal.  Shut it!  Yeah.  So that's what he got me for.  And then he comes over to the vehicle.  And, uh...  He's like,  Roll your windows down! 
[00:05:00]  So I'm...  Beep, beep...  He goes,  Roll the back windows down!  Like, that's as far as they go.  Because they don't go all the way down, you know?  It's a fancy vehicle.  Probably not one that you're used to.  You rat!  So, uh...  He looks in my truck.  He's peeking around.  And, uh...  License and registration.  Proof of insurance.  So, uh...  I get all the shit out and... 
[00:05:30]  Unfortunately, my registration is up there on my, uh, counter.  At home.  Oh, and...  Hey.  You want it from me?  It's registered.  I mean, it's fucking registered.  I mean, just the sticker thing isn't, uh, up there.  Says you.  Yeah, yeah.  Says me.  And, uh...  And I can't stand insurance companies these days.  It's like your fucking insurance cards expire every two weeks.  Every two weeks!  It's like fucking...  Why, what is this?  I get a new one?  Where is it? 
[00:06:00]  It used to be, hey, I paid for my year of insurance.  Here's my years...  My card for a year.  And you fucking take it out.  The next year you get a new one.  Now it's all willy-nilly.  Who the fuck knows when they give it to you?  I've used that excuse before.  Yeah, my...  That's not an excuse.  My homework.  I did my homework.  I left it at home.  But I did it.  All right.  She said the dog ate your insurance card.  Yeah.  Your wife ate my insurance card.  Should have told him.  Fucking prick. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, so, uh...  So he walks back to the fucking toll booth.  The toll booth.  He's fucking toll taker with a gun.  Oh, God.  He walks back there and just proceeds to now take forever.  Forever.  And he comes walking back.  And I'm like, okay.  He's done.  Uh, your insurance card is expired.  Do you have a new one?  Uh, no.  Not here.  No.  All right. 
[00:07:00]  He turns back around and walks back to the toll booth.  And I'm just watching the clock.  And, like, now I'm fucking late.  And, uh...  And I know he's writing.  This isn't fucking his little opportunity to tell everyone back at the booth he's giving me a break.  He's fucking writing.  I finally got that prick.  Oh, you know.  You know.  I'm just gonna make him sit there for a while.  I'm gonna make him sit and wait.  So, uh...  He finally comes back with, uh, three tickets. 
[00:07:30]  One of which is, uh, you know, I didn't show my, my Reggie.  I didn't show my, my insurance.  And the other one is failure to signal lane change.  There's so much paper there.  Yeah.  But aren't two of them, like, if you prove that you have it, that you, you don't have to pay the ticket or no?  Well, when he came up and gave these to me, I turn around and I said, I go, you're screwing with me, aren't you?  You're screwing with me. 
[00:08:00]  Sir?  I go, first of all, these two get thrown right out.  And I go, and the lane change, I go, I'm just gonna say that NYPD van that was next to me changed lanes and went into my lane and I changed lanes under emergency and, and didn't signal.  But I was changing lanes because another vehicle was coming in on me.  I go, you're screwing with me, right?  You're free to go, sir.  I go, just say you're screwing with me.  You're free to go.  I'll stop the traffic while you pull out, sir. 
[00:08:30]  You fucking cocksucker.  He's fucking with me.  They're fucking with me at the Midtown Tunnel Plaza.  Because they can.  A gross display of authority.  Misused.  Misused.  So you think they were waiting for you?  They were waiting for that day?  I now know what it's like to be a black man.  I know what it's like to be a black man.  I was being profiled.  You fucking speeding around an escalade with a gun. 
[00:09:00]  You've known what it was like to be a black man for a long time.  Oh, when you said three tickets, I thought they might have got you for fucking speeding or not that those are, but at least those aren't fucking major.  Nah, that's bullshit.  That's why I know he was fucking with me.  He was totally fucking with me.  He made me wait there longer than it would have taken to just write three tickets. 
[00:09:30]  And he wrote me up for like fucking, you know, come on.  It's just annoying because now you're either going to have to hire a lawyer or spend a day in traffic court or whatever.  I'll just hire people to fucking do my bidding.  I'll hire people to fucking do my will and fucking go to court.  Take care of this shit.  Drag him in there, though.  He could face off with my mouthpiece.  That's what he's going to do.  It would be great if your lawyer filed something wrong and everything got mixed up and you were sentenced to four years in prison. 
[00:10:00]  That would not be good, Jimmy.  It wouldn't be good, but it would be amusing.  Like, ah, you silly goose.  It would be funny for everyone involved.  Well, I took a little picture of my escapade there at the toll plaza, which they'll probably get me on.  Why are you taking my picture?  That's me looking backwards at the fucking little walkway that he walks between as I was hoping he would stumble, get plowed over. 
[00:10:30]  Cocksucker.  Yeah, you're not supposed to take photos of bridges and tunnels, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Is that a law?  I see it on the Verrazano.  I don't know if it's a law everywhere.  Yeah, a law.  Is it a policy or a law?  Exactly.  It's a big difference.  It is just a sign.  It is policy.  Even I am not above policy.  Little Yeti Seinfeld.  Yeah, yeah.  So now I don't know.  Are they going to just keep fucking with me every day? 
[00:11:00]  They know what time I come through.  They could fucking pull me over there and make me wait every time.  Well, here's your option.  Yeah.  You film every time you drive through with a GoPro like you do sometimes.  And then you fuck with them back.  And if you just make sure you don't change lanes.  Yeah.  And you make, in this way, if they pull you over and fuck with you and you got proof on  your GoPro, that the whole thing is a lie, then they have a fucking major problem.  That's a harassment thing. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  But make sure you just, you know how you shoot fucking forward and you shoot yourself.  Yeah.  I just get two cameras.  Dude.  Fucking guy.  You think they pulled you over to fuck with you?  Or they pulled you over and then realized who you were?  No.  And said, all right, let's fuck with him.  I saw the guy's face when I was pulling up.  I know he fucking knew who I was.  Was it Christmas?  He was, yes.  It was like a kid on Christmas morning to look on his face like, oh, here's the asshole  now.  Here he comes. 
[00:12:00]  Wouldn't it be funny if he just did something too?  Like if yesterday he went back to church for the first time in years, like his wife said,  I want you to start going to church.  He's like, I don't want to go.  And then he just went.  And then the next day, there you are.  There I am.  He's like, it works.  Just present it up to him like a fucking sacrifice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They are the worst.  Yeah.  They'll just keep pulling you over knowing that you don't have your license or your registration  and just keep giving you the same ticket over and over.  His little dot of jurisdiction he's got there.  His little plaza. 
[00:12:30]  This is my plaza.  I'm the law here on this plaza.  There he is.  The fucking king of the plaza.  You should thank him profusely for it when he does it.  Yeah.  It's no money.  I mean, it's nothing.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I just don't want to make it be late every fucking time.  But if he's doing that and it's for your safety, I would thank you.  Thank you.  Thank God I make so much that the money means nothing.  I appreciate you looking out for my safety.  He didn't.  I was even fucking, I was taunting him to fucking give me an answer. 
[00:13:00]  I'm like, you're screwing with me, right?  Right?  You're free to go, sir.  At least give me that.  At least, were you at the dinner?  Was I at the dinner?  Were you at the dinner?  Will you tell me that?  Will you tell me that?  At least give me that.  All right.  I was at the dinner.  All right.  He says I was at the dinner.  You're a liar.  Yes.  Oh, no.  I'm fucking Anthony.  Hi.  And I'm trying to get that guy to come here and debate me.  But will he?  Will he come and debate me?  Hope he's somewhere going, what is this guy doing? 
[00:13:30]  We told him to shut his mouth.  He's talking about the NDA again.  We can't have this.  Oh, my God.  We told him to buy it.  And you're on fucking TV!  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah.  That's another little piece of the puzzle here.  Fucking guy.  I think it was, too.  I think it was the same fucking guy that tried to stop me when I beeped. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, look, he's some fucking little fucking ginger-looking fucking Irish prick.  How old do you think?  Eh, fucking in his 30s, maybe.  Somewhere around there.  You think he's going to post on his message board?  Oh, he's going to be...  Got him, guys!  Got him!  Brought him in!  Update!  Update!  Got him!  That's not a huge ticket, though.  Like, it's basically all that is is a failure to signal.  I know.  Like, that's not a good ticket. 
[00:14:30]  You want to get someone doing 80 in the tunnel.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter, though, because he fucking...  He got me.  That's just it.  The little cat and mouse game, he fucking whacked me across the room.  Yeah, he did.  If you were Al-Qaeda...  Yeah.  ...and he was the U.S., he didn't get Bin Laden or Al-Zawahad.  No, he just got...  Fucking...  He got, like, a lieutenant from Kenya.  Ah, okay.  That's what that was.  It was a fucking...  Yeah.  ...a middle-ranking Al-Qaeda lieutenant. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just hated the fact that...  And the longer it went on, the more I knew, like, oh, yeah, they fucking got me.  They fucking got me.  All you can do is sit there.  All you can do is sit there.  There's no recourse.  And, uh...  Ah, he was so pissed.  He has to think about all the horrible things you'll be able to say about him whenever he  lets you go, because you get to go talk on the radio.  Well, that's true.  That's true.  I can't even read his fucking name here, either. 
[00:15:30]  I can't read it.  Oh, you've really scribbled that one out, knowing that I'm going to come on the fucking  air.  Like you said, he's got such that small jurisdiction that you're in...  Like, you're a big part of his world, I'll bet.  I bet I am.  Like, how often does somebody publicly fuck with specific MTA workers?  Never happened before.  BTO.  Bridge and tunnel officer.  I'm a BTO at the Midtown Tunnel.  Look out! 
[00:16:00]  Wow!  Wowie!  But that's what you fucking dreamt about as a kid?  You're probably going to be number one.  They don't make TV shows about the BTOs.  They fucking, you know, NYPD, you'll see it, Chicago, LA, you know, fucking down there,  Miami, all that shit.  You'll see that shit.  Never a real action movie about the bridge and tunnel cops, are there?  Watch it!  The gate didn't go up!  I got this one! 
[00:16:30]  Although they just shot the pilot today, if there is a show about them.  Yeah.  The asshole in the Escalade.  Law and Order BTO!  Oh, really?  Yeah?  BTO Blue.  BTO Blue.  A big fucking day down there at the plaza, huh?  It's spelled B-L-E-W.  Blue.  BTO Blue.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look out.  Swung! 
[00:17:00]  Ah.  N-C-S-I-B-T-O.  E-I-E-I-O.  He used his forensics to figure out why the easy pass didn't work.  He went from one lane to the other, Sam, and there was no signal!  No!  Ah, shit.  I hate getting got.  I hate it.  I was skating through there, fucking laughing every time that gate went up and I went through. 
[00:17:30]  I'd give a little chuckle.  Ha-ha!  I thought they nailed you speeding or something.  No.  They don't got me.  They don't got me for that.  It's like fucking how they got Capone on Tax Evasion.  Got me on a lane change.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Look at that  Fucking mad dogs over there on MSNBC  Talking about the A-Rod thing  Talking about the A-Rod suspension  His giant hands  He's a big handed ass 
[00:18:00]  Well looks like he's going to be suspended today  For the rest of the season  And next season  I bet he drove in safely  You think he got through  Well he doesn't do unsafe lane changes  I'll tell you  I have nothing but the utmost respect  For real police officers  I don't give him any lip  Or anything like that  But the BTOs  The Bachman-Turner overdrives 
[00:18:30]  The fucking bridge and tunnel guys  I don't see it  I just don't see it  First of all  You can't have a cop job  That doubles as a toll taker  You know  Sometimes they're working  You know law enforcement  Sometimes they're making change  While you're going through  The toll booth  Easy pass should have negated  Every single human being 
[00:19:00]  At a toll plaza  Their job could be taken care of  With easy passes and cameras  Easy passes and cameras  That's all you need  That's it  That's all you fucking need  But they're unions I guess  You know  They keep them there  We could be saving a lot of fucking money  In this city  Eliminate those fucking useless jobs  Yeah but they need someone  In case the gate doesn't go up  Yeah yeah  Well no gates  They got cameras  It takes a fucking picture 
[00:19:30]  They send you a bill  Yeah but if there's  If there's a wild man  Who keeps crossing through these tolls  Just on a mission of destruction  Oh yeah  There needs to be someone  Like our red-headed friend  Who saved the day today  Are you saying  If there's a troublemaker  Coming through  Putting other motorists in danger  Exactly  Zipping back and forth  In between lanes  Like he owns the damn place  Yeah  There's not one fucking person out there  Who has not changed  Which fucking little thing  You're going through at the toll booth 
[00:20:00]  I have many times done that  But it's always  Always with a signal change  It is not  A signal always  You gotta alert your fellow drivers  Absolutely  As to what you're about to do  Let the people behind me know what I'm doing  And let anybody looking in the rear view mirror know  I'm peeling off here folks  I even use the hand signal  Oh god no  Yeah 10 o'clock 2 o'clock  I'll do it smartly  No you don't  Hand right out there  And never without  Up to date registration  Never  I mean that's just irresponsible  For an insurance card  I check it before I leave the garage 
[00:20:30]  Every day  I make sure  You have a driving checklist  Yes I do  Check insurance  Reggie check  I'm reggie checking  I really can't stand that part of it  Where it's just  The fucking insurance  Your proof of insurance nowadays  It just expires  It willy nilly  You would think by now  They would have like an insurance card  With a scanner on it  And  And it'll either be valid  Or invalid  Exactly  Like they could check it  Instead of sending you a new card  Every six months  And they send you the card  Like three months before you need it 
[00:21:00]  So you just put it aside  You're like  Okay I'll put it in the car later  And why the fuck are we dealing with  Handing paper out the window in 2013  This should all be fucking digital  It'll be an app  It should all be an app  You should have your fucking insurance  Reggie  Everything on your phone  Well actually it'll be on the scanner  Of the easy pass  And it will scan all your stuff  And if you don't have a registration  Or whatever  You'll also get a ticket immediately  Like it'll be one of those things  Where they fucking get you  Every time

With my daughter  Right  And you're like  Oh it's safe  Nobody's signaling to come over 
[00:24:30]  No one's coming over here  No  There was nobody  Squish  Near the lane  There was an NYPD van  To my right  And we both came up  At about the same speed  The NYPD van  I was flanking his rear  Fucking quarter panel there  And uh  And uh  He moved  He went to move over  One lane  To get into his little  Toll thing there  And I moved over  At the same time  It was like  Synchronized swimming  After signaling  He moved over  No he didn't signal either 
[00:25:00]  By the way  By the by  And uh  And I moved over  And if I hadn't  Moved over  That NYPD van  Would have uh  Would have clipped  My front end  So I changed lanes  To  To save everybody  At the plaza  See this is  The second half  This is the second half  Of the ultra exciting  Law and order BTO  Where we get to the court  Yes yes  And a jury of your peers  Decides whether or not

[00:56:30]  Twittered  Me  About  It  And  It  Was  About  Free  Speech  And  He  Was  I  Guess  Talking  About  He  Was  He  Was  A  Really  Smart  Guy  He  Was  Talking  About  Hate  Speech  And  How  I  Think  That  He  Doesn't  Even  Believe  That  There  Should  Be  Any  Limits  On  Free  Speech  Right  And  He  Talking  About  How  And  He  Talked  About  The  Worst  Ones  Right  Now  Are  Radical  Islam  And  He  Saying  How  That  If  You  Say  Certain  Things  You  Are  Islamophobic  And  He 
[00:57:00]  Goes  But  You  Look  Where  Real  Hate  Speech  Is  Coming  From  Is  Religion  And  He  Talking  About  Look  At  All  The  Anti  Gay  Stuff  It  In  The  Bible  And  That  Is  Protected  And  He  Just  Talks  About  How  We  Are  Giving  Away  Our  Ability  To  Hear  Things  We  Don't  Like  And  He  Said  When  You  Stop  Someone  From  Saying  Something  You  And  It  Was  So  Smart  And  So  On 
[00:57:30]  Point  And  That  That's  What  We're  Doing  Yeah  We're  Taking  Away  Unpleasant  And  I'm  Not  Saying  That  Him  Mumbling  Nigger  Is  An  Opposing  View  That  We  Need  To  Hear  But  It  Falls  Under  That  Thing  Of  We're  Robbing  Ourselves  Of  This  Ability  To  Hear  Things  We  Don't  Like  Or  Don't  Think  We  Need  To  Hear  Right  Right  Yeah  I  I  Don't  At  Least  Be  Able  To  Say  It  And  Have  People  Go  Wow  That  Guy's  An  Asshole 
[00:58:00]  Now  The  Just  The  Fucking  Idea  That  This  Guy's  Gotta  Go  To  Some  Kind  Of  Counseling  Like  He's  Done  Something  So  Wrong  And  The  Statements  That  They  Give  Yeah  What  Are  Some  Of  The  Statements  Over  The  Top  Like  You  If  I  Read  You  This  Statement  And  Didn't  Tell  You  What  It  Was  For  You  Would  Think  He  Did  Something  Terrible  The  Eagle  Statement  As  We  Have  Said  Riley  Cooper  Will  Be  Seeking  Counseling  And  We  Have  Excused  Him  From  All  Team  Activities  This  Is  All 
[00:58:30]  New  Territory  And  We  Are  Going  To  Evaluate  This  Timetable  Every  Step  Of  The  Way  He  Will  Meet  With  Professionals  Provided  By  The  Eagles  During  This  Time  Period  During  This  Period  To  Better  Help  Him  Understand  How  His  Words  Have  Hurt  So  Many  Including  His  Teammates  Can  You  Fucking  Believe  That  Statement  I  Don't  Think  That  They're  Making  Him  Do  It  I  Think  That  He's  Been  Excused  Meaning  He's  Being  I'm  Thinking  He's  Volunteering  To  Do  It  Like  Look  Dude  This  Is  A  Nightmare  Okay  Look  Because  He  Probably  Wants  To  Do  It  Just  Because  He  Wants  To  Be  To  Face  His  Teammate  And 
[00:59:00]  That  May  Be  Mad  But  Like  Look  Like  Fucking  That  Scene  Out  Of  Fast  Times  At  Ridgemont  High  But  Is  Any  Black  Football  Player  Who  Be  Pissed  Off  That  He  Said  That  Would  They  Really  Feel  Better  That  Oh  He  Went  To  Counseling  I'm  Not  Mad  Anymore  No  His  Statement  Oh  Yeah  His  Statement  I'll  I'll 
[00:59:30]  Cut  It  Down  A little  Cause  It's  Oh  I  Like  Three  Oh  You  Want  The  Last  Few  Days  Have  Been  Incredibly  Difficult  For  Me  My  Actions  Were  Inexcusable  The  More  I  Think  About  What  I  Did  The  More  Disgust  That  I  Get  I  Keep  Trying  To  Figure  Out  How  I  Could  Have  Said  Something  So  Repulsive  And  What  I  Can  Do  To  Make  Things  Better  I'll  Say  The  Only  Thing  I like  About  This  So  Far  Is  He  Saying  I  And  He's  Giving  A  A  Personal  Account 
[01:00:00]  Like  A  Real  First  Person  Account  The  Only  Thing  I  Like  So  Far  Is  At  Least  He's  Saying  Hey  Look  I  Did  I  Said  This  I  Feel  Bad  Like  He's  Not  It's  Not  Like  This  Doesn't  Sound  Like  It  Was  Totally  Written  By  Let  Let  Let  Let  Let  Let  Let  Let  Let  Explain  Something  Though  Much  He  Isn't  Disgusted  At  What  He  Said  Now  And  I'm  Not  Saying  It's  Because  He's  A  Racist  And  He's  Not  Disgusted  He  Wants  To  Say  It  More  Because  You  Can't  Be  Disgusted  It's  Something  That  Isn't  Really  Anything  It's  Not  A  Big  Fucking  Deal  Let's  Be  Fucking  Real

[01:01:30]  Have  Done  Something  That  Was  So  Offensive  And  How  I  Can  Start  The  Healing  Process  For  Everyone  As  Long  As  It  Takes  And  Whatever  I  Have  To  Do  I'm  Going  To  Try  And  Make  This  Right  Charlie  Rangel  A  Democratic  Policy  Maker  Says  What  He  Says  And  Doesn't  Have  To  Go  Through  This  This  Is  Astounding  He  Said  The  Word  Nigger  Once  On  On  A  Video  At  A  Kenny  Chesney  Concert  Was he  Drunk  Or  No  Probably  But  Regardless  He  Says  It  And  Fucking

[01:05:30]  And  The  Threat  Or  The  Hit  That  Michael  Dick's  Brother  Put  Out  On  Where  The  Fuck  That  To  Me  Is  A  Much  Worse  Story  A  Guy  Offering  To  Pay  For  Violent  Things  To  Happen  The  Brother  Who  Of  The  Guy  That  Fucking  Killed  Dogs  Culture  Fucking  Yeah  Well  It's  A  Cultural  Thing  I  Guess  It  Really  That  Was  Wrong  I  Don't  Know  What  He  Did  Was  Wrong  I  Don't  Know  How  Like  When  You  Look  At  The  Racial  Divide  In  This  Country 
[01:06:00]  And  Stuff  And  You  Hear  About  This  Institutional  Racism  Of  The  White  Society  Against  Black  People  And  How  In  Order  To  Be  Racist  You  Need  A  Power  Base  They  Say  You  Can't  Be  Racist  Unless  You  Have  A  Power  Base  What  Is  A  Bigger  Power  Base  Than  If  You  Utter  One  Word  Your  Career  Can  Be  Over  And  Having  Seems  To  Me  To  Be  The  Most  Powerful  Thing  Right  Now  More  Powerful  Than 
[01:06:30]  A  Boss  Trying  To  Squeak  Something  Through  These  Massive  Channels  Of  Equal  Opportunity  That  He  Would  Have  To  If  He  Was  Racist  And  Didn't  Want  To  Hire  A  Black  Person  Based  On  Race  He  Would  Have  To  Do  Some  Wrangling  And  Tap  Dance  And  Fucking  All  Kind  Of  Shit  Meanwhile  Black  People  Have  This  Magical  Thing  Where  If  You  Say  One  Word  You're  Done  In  Your  Fucking  Life  That  To  Me  Is  An  Amazing 
[01:07:00]  Amount  Of  Power  That  Should  Not  Be  Available  To  People  Well  You  Should  Also  I  Think  You  Know  When  They  Say  You  Can't  Be  Racist  Unless  You  Have  Power  Base  Yeah  It's  Like  Maybe  As  You  Can't  It's  Hard  To  Say  That  The  The  System  Is  Systematically  Racist  Against  Whites  But  As An  Individual  You  Can  Absolutely  Be  A  Fucking  Racist  If  You're  Black  Or  If  You're  Fucking  Brown  It's  That's  Just  An  Excuse  Of  Course  You  Can  Be  Racist  There's  It's  Supposedly  And  I've  Heard  Usually  From  From  Black  People 
[01:07:30]  That  Have  Said  That  In  Order  To  Truly  Be  Racist  You  Need  To  Have  Some  Type  Of  Power  Base  That  Can  Deny  People  Something  Like  You  Have  To  Be  To  Career  And  Fucking  Reputation  Based  On  Uttering  One  Single  Word  That  To  Me  Is  More  Power  Than  Anything  Else  You  Can  Fucking  Point  Out  In 
[01:08:00]  Society  Today  There's  A lot  Of  White  People  Doing  This  To  Them  Too  Though  Yeah  Well  It's  All tied  In  The  Same  Thing  I  Know  The  Guilty  White  People  Are  They  Make  Me  Equally  As  Disgusted  As  These  Race  Baiting  Fucking  Fake  Leaders  Of  The  Black  Community  Worse  Because  I  Think  Their  Dishonesty  Is  So  Great  And  It's  Not  That  They're  Not  Appalled  By  Racism  Like  You  Know  People  Are  Appalled  By  Racism  And  That's  True  Racism  Yeah  But  It's  This  Fucking  Fake  This 
[01:08:30]  Fake  I  Will  Make  Myself  Look  Better  By  Holding  You  Out  Right  In  Front  Of  Me  Look  At  This  Person  I  Could  Never  Be  Like  This  And  A  Decent  Society  Must  Look  So  Fucking  Dangerous  Well  It's  The  Same  As  It  But  It's  Who  We  Are  Dishonest  We  Are  We're  Liar  Elliot  Spencer  Feels  Free  To  Say  That  The  Other  Guy  Is  A  Bigger  Pervert  Like  That's

[01:10:00]  He  Did  This  Is  He  Was  Never  Given  A  Sexual  Harassment  Lesson  He  Never  Was  Offered  The  Ability  To  Have  This  Class  Well  You Know  What  That  Is  Sexual  Harassment  So  He  Never  Knew  That  You  Shouldn't  Do  Certain  Things  That  Figuring  Out  Okay  We  Live  In  This  HR  World  And  You  Guys  Was  That  Wrong  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  So  Now  I  Can  Use  That  As  The  Advantage  If  I  Had  Known  If  I  Had  Known  Was  That  Wrong

I'm really disappointed in that clip, is that I couldn't see her  vagina. But she was giving her a good anal  rogering. That's all the porn  you really need. That was done very well.  Like, fucking beginning, 
[02:11:30]  middle, and done. You could just  jack it to that. I would need a little  bit more. Yeah? Just to see a bit  longer. I would like to see a little more vagina.  Yeah. Yeah. Like when the girl woke  up, was she, you know,  was she like, who are you? Why are you licking my vagina?  Did you eat a fucking Hershey  bar on my bed?  See, it's shit. I got it.  Oh, okay.  Tilly and Pepper again. These two are Tilly's  Revenge. Tilly. Oh, I love that one.  What is that on the... Tilly's rather  lovely. The Ice Planet of Hoth. 
[02:12:00]  Now Tilly  is licking her vagina. Wow. They get  vengeance in a very fun way in this city.  Look at her pubic mound. Yeah.  Wow. She has a very  lovely vagina. Now you can only see  Tilly's, not Pepper's.  You see, Tilly's vagina is over Pepper's face.  Yes. And they're getting revenge  by licking each other's... This is  some vengeance going on here. Yeah, it sure  is. Oh, what has she got there?  It looks like my toothbrush.  That's what I wish it was.  I wish it were my toothbrush.  It does look like some type of toothbrush. 
[02:12:30]  It looks like a giant chest piece toothbrush  and she's rubbing it on Pepper's  ample vagina. Wow. These are  two very attractive  girls for porn. Yeah.  Usually they're a little more beat up than these two.  And she put a towel over a girl's face  which is normally what a woman does to me.  Put a towel on my face. That was  nice. Yeah.  Oh. Yeah, I don't like the mutt sound.  No. No.  It's not very pleasant. They bark and they wake the parents up.  Goddamn dogs that  woof-a-woof-a. Then you gotta 
[02:13:00]  stumble out of the room before the father  walks in.  You're a guest in this house, Mr. Hargis.  Why? Why would Mr. Hargis  even be a guest? Yeah.  House with children. The dog starts  a woof-a-woof and you stumble  out of the room and you step  on one of the little play toys and it  goes, hee-haw! And the father  looks in there.  Imagine Uncle Paul walking out of the room  like fucking hitching his pants up  and the father's standing right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, the kid's crying like I was checking  on him. 
[02:13:30]  I was helping.  Which one?  Oh, what is that? A little foot worship?  This is called Pepper's Surprise.  Oh.  Is there a ghost or a member of the clan?  There's somebody under a white sheet.  There's a white sheet.  Oh, she's ripping holes in this white sheet  and now it's right over the vagina.  I'm actually touching my nipples for this.  She hit pay dirt.  Oh.  Yeah, I hope those were sheets that were  bought and not borrowed.  What the fuck did she got there?  It looks like an old singer's sewing machine  on her hand.  Well, hopefully she's fixing that faulty sheet. 
[02:14:00]  She has something that straps on  the back of her hand and vibrates her entire hand.  But it looks ancient.  It's the thing Demolition Man wore.  And there's a girl under a sheet  having her vagina licked.  Oh, she's out now.  Oh, welcome back.  Tilly is fucking hot, too.  Isn't that Tilly?  Tilly's pretty hot.  Tilly's a fucking home run.  Pepper and Tilly, a lot of films together.  They're very comfortable together.  Very attractive.  Yeah.  They offset each other nicely.  Ooh, to be continued.  To be continued.  It's like the end of Back to the Future.  Yeah.  Like that.  Oh, Roland, you came on your shirt. 
[02:14:30]  Roland.  Again.  Roland's gum-stained shirt.  Yeah, it's Tilly McReese.  And, uh...  Very nice.  I missed the chance to hang out  with Pepper and Tilly together.  Oh, God.  You see the kind of stuff they do.  Would you have seen them do stuff, you think?  No.  I think they would have just hung out.  Honestly, I don't think so.  I think we just would have hung out  and goofed around.  How do you make that move?  I would definitely try to make the move 
[02:15:00]  where they have some sex  and maybe, you know,  your jacket in the corner or something.  Well, I didn't...  Of course, I would have thought of that, but...  Well, you've got to make...  You've got to close the deal.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, it would have been very, very nice.  Look at this.  Pepper's now licking  and sucking Tilly's nice nipple.  Now Tilly is returning the fair  by licking Pepper's...  Wow, that is a very nice vagina she has there.  Yeah.  They're like really regular hot girls.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  She's giving quite a lapping there.  Girls on her back. 
[02:15:30]  I'd love to be there.  Pepper's a ginger, I guess.  A natural ginger.  Yeah.  Maybe the sister of the fucking tunnel and bridge guy  that I was...  Hopefully.  Yeah, exactly.  They're good friends.  It reminds me of us who were on the road.  Yeah.  Remember this?  Oh, boy.  She gives a good strap-on.  She's giving a good strap-on fucking.  Yeah, she gives a much better fuck than I do.  Well, it's easy when she doesn't have to worry about,  you know,  shooting the load  or the fucking, uh... 
[02:16:00]  the fucking dildo going soft.  Yeah.  It does happen.  It does happen.  Doesn't it?  The old dildo going soft.  Yep.  They don't have to worry about badge.  No, they don't.  It's easy being a girl.  Yeah.  You chicks.  Yep.  What could happen to a hole  dries out.  You could fucking throw some shit in there.  Absolutely.  What do you mean it could dry out?  It always does.  It's amazing how many times  I've put my face by it  and it's just like two fucking...  two thumbs next to each other.  I'm like, 
[02:16:30]  I need to work on my game  to moisten this thing.  Yeah.  We'll take a little break.  And, um...  return after this  short break.  The OPNN3 show  The OPNN3 show  On Sirius XM  The guys are back from the toilet  And now, back to our show  The OPNN3 show  That was literally correct.

The whiz on the electric fence?  Yes. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  That was a great show.  Uh, yeah.  Great prostate.  Oh, thank you.  Complimenting my prostate, I guess.  That's always nice to...  Let's give it a check.  Yeah.

[02:18:00]  The mini-documentary.  Well, yeah,  that kind of got into that whole thing.  I was watching a documentary  on television.  You're talking about a serious one.  Yes.  And it was, um...  In the Shadow of the Moon,  I think it was called.  And, uh...  Another one.  They did a whole thing  because I guess it was, um...  Uh, the anniversary  of the moon landing.  So I was watching  a lot of documentaries on it.  And the Shadow of the Moon  was one.  And it's great.  It's amazing footage  of the Apollo program 
[02:18:30]  and interviews  with the astronauts now.  Um, and that was,  I guess, 2007  it came out.  So it was then.  But, uh, Buzz Aldrin  talking and, uh,  Collins, uh...  It was just...  Collins Quinn.  Collins Quinn.  Well, you know,  I was on the other side  of the moon.  All they were doing...  You know, I would have liked  to have, you know,  walked on the moon,  but fuck.  I just stayed on the fucking ship  while you were on the moon.  You might walk.  I just stayed on the fucking ship.  Yes.  Biting his hand. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, it was, uh...  It was just fucking amazing.  Like, like...  I've seen so many documentaries  on it.  And Ron Howard did it.  Uh, presented, uh...  So it's...  It just makes such good space movies.  That fucking guy.  Yeah.  He did Apollo 13  and, uh, looked great.  But, um...  The documentary was...  It just showed...  The fucking 1960s.  Barely knew anything  about that shit.  And then, after ten years, 
[02:19:30]  man's walking on the moon.  And, uh, the machinery,  the men that did it.  What a set of balls  these guys had.  Just jump on big tanks of fuel  and, and just think  that it's gonna work.  Really crazy.  Uh, I, I highly recommend it.  And it was kind of, uh...  It was kind of sad  at the same time  because you realize  that whole period of time  is just fucking gone.  Just gone.  This...  The immense talent pool  that went into  sending men to the moon  and, uh, building that equipment 
[02:20:00]  and, and the support team  that was on, on Earth  and, uh, the guys  that actually went  and did it.  Just all of them  fucking amazing.  And, uh, so I'm watching that  and just awe-inspired  and a little sad  that, uh, that time is gone.  And then, I, I find a video.  Hang on, let me get it.  That is just...  Yeah, I find that video.  Uh, it's so good.  It's from, um... 
[02:20:30]  I think Kenya?  Probably.  No, Zimbabwe.  If I try.  Oh.  We're...  Zimbabwe.  This is Zimbabwe.  Kenya, if we try.  Oh, come on.  Is that terrible?  Horrible.  Oh.  This is from Zimbabwe.  And I honestly believe  that this, the white guy...  Could you turn this up a little bit?  Or a lot of bit?  Hold on, let me, let me just set up  a little bit. 
[02:21:00]  This, this is a white guy  and he's the, the journalist, I guess.  He's, he's got a camera  and a fucking mic  and I honestly think  he's goofing on this guy.  Okay.  Constantly goofing on him.  I'm not sure.  I think he's, he's doing the report,  but he's fucking goofing on this guy.  It's this guy from Zimbabwe  who decided he's going to build  his own helicopter.  You know, he's fascinated with,  uh, aeronautics and, uh, helicopters.  And just because  he's impoverished in Zimbabwe 
[02:21:30]  doesn't mean he can't join  the, uh, wonderful world of aeronautics.  Right.  So he builds his own helicopter  and this guy is reporting on the story.  Uh, it's fascinating.  Da-da-da-da.  94.  Zimbabwe.  14 years after independence,  we are behind in the aviation race.  Until now.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  We have joined  the aviation developers. 
[02:22:00]  One man, a courageous man,  Flight Lieutenant Zimbabwe.  Flight Lieutenant.  He keeps calling him  Flight Lieutenant.  Has built himself  a helicopter.  Who will help this?  He needs finance.  He hopes to start  a helicopter factory.  To quote an old cliche,  for so long we have done  so much with so little,  it is now possible  for us to do anything  with nothing.  What?  That's a quote?  Yeah, I've got a t-shirt.  With his brilliant intelligence. 
[02:22:30]  Brilliant.  Has shown us the way,  the way to the future  in Zimbabwe aviation.  Let's go and join him now.  Look at this!  They show this guy.  There's good tunes.  Look at this hunk of shit!  It looks like paper machete.  Yes.  It's just this  bolted together  disaster  of metal  and  I don't know  how you even describe it.  Daunted in his task 
[02:23:00]  to prove his ability.  Who will hear his cry?  Look at the wheels!  A cry for help.  A cry to finance his project.  We're standing here today  with Flight Lieutenant Zimbabwe.  The man  who made his dream come true  by building himself  a helicopter.  Flight Lieutenant.  Flight Lieutenant.  We'll hear some details  about this helicopter  for the international public.  And he keeps talking about  how he actually flew it.  He's lying.  What was the original aim  in building the helicopter?  Well, basically, 
[02:23:30]  I'm trying to come up  with the fastest  and the most cheapest  means of transport,  which is the helicopter.  Ah!  Which is the helicopter.  His caption has him  as Flight Lieutenant.  Yes, it says  Flight Lieutenant.  Flight Lieutenant Zimbabwe.  Flight Lieutenant Zimbabwe.  Able to be used by  this is more  for the communal topic.  Yeah.  Go forward in it a little bit  because it's kind of long.  Yeah, go to the point  where he, like,  starts actually...  Look at it!  The rotors  are so small 
[02:24:00]  and they're spinning  so slowly.  Look at the wheels on it.  It's like a baby carriage.  The wheels are baby carriage wheels.  It's got to weigh  20 times more  than any helicopter  that's actually flying.  It's just made out of  big plates of iron.  You don't think it flies?  No.  Now, Flight Lieutenant,  did you...  It looks like he used  parts from a radio flyer.  Yes, yes.  You know,  from a little wagon.  About 47?  Not specifically 
[02:24:30]  from any given helicopter,  but however,  I'd like to say  I did to an extent  you know,  utilize,  for example,  my structural base.  My structural base  from the Apache.  From the Apache helicopter  he based this on.  But that doesn't...  Yeah.  He's a very tall  African gentleman  dressed in yellow  with a yellow  motorcycle crash helmet on  with, like,  a red spot  painted on the front. 
[02:25:00]  Look at the tail rotor.  He's pointing out  that his helicopter  is also yellow.  Yes,  his helicopter is yellow.  He's got a helicopter book,  which is nice,  and he's pointing  at pictures.  of real helicopters.  You think this thing's lies?  No.  But he said  he's gotten it up  to 100 kilometers per hour,  and he's floated  for short distances.  Those are lies.  They are absolute lies.  Because he starts it up  at one point.  Get to the point.  Oh, yeah,  go to where... 
[02:25:30]  I think he talks  about the engine.  Look at the engine.  It looks like the wires  are stuck on  with chewed gum.  Yeah, they're just...  He's got a big battery  in there, and...  And the function  was to convert motion  to the vertical...  This is what's going  on in Zimbabwe.  ...the new body.  Ah, yes.  Then I converted the...  Get when he starts it.  ...the gear  to operate his aircraft.  Somewhere there.  He's sitting...  He's got a flying...  ...good vision.  Good vision! 
[02:26:00]  There's a giant piece  of metal in his face.  Now, these are the  control mechanisms.  Yes.  We've got a clutch system  which is supposed to  engage and disengage  the gear  when the machine is on.  Oh.  Then we've got...  What is that?  ...a steering mechanism  for elevation.  As we have asked  your question...  The entire rotors  tilt forward and backwards.  Not like...  ...a normal helicopter would.  At this edge...  And it doesn't look like  it's fastened by anything.  He certainly did. 
[02:26:30]  I'm sure you can see...  He's doing more  than everyone else over there.  You know, you're right.  I'm sure the rotors are moving up...  Look at the...  The rotors look like  those blades  that they cut each other up with.  They look like giant  handmade machete blades.  Looks like the one  fucking Billy Bob Thorpe  was holding a slave blade.  Yes!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  It's the building  Billy Bob Thorpe's head.  Then, as you go on like that...  Look, the whole thing moves.  ...which is at 90 degrees  to the...  See, I don't think,  first of all,  that these rotors  would have any lift 
[02:27:00]  to them whatsoever.  If I have to take off,  I have to take off  at 90 degrees.  Which is...  Look at the whole thing,  chefs!  The whole rotor...  And it's...  And it's much too small.  And I could be almost  something like this.  Because it's over time.  Like, do you honestly think  that that could...  Could lift that?  Would you take a ride in it?  100...  Sure, it's safe.  It's never gonna get off the ground.  You might die of carbon monoxide poisoning.  ...and so forth and so on.  And by the time I...  He just got pieces off  like a swing set. 
[02:27:30]  And that looks like  a piece of a lounge chair.  So I...  I'll be starting...  Hi, Jackie.  As to what you start up.  If I can...  Oh, he's starting up.  Look at the propeller.  The rotors going around  at like...  Okay, go ahead.  ...one revolution per minute.  I can actually stand on the windshield  that hop over each one.  Playing some Zimbabwe music. 
[02:28:00]  But I'll tell you.  It's not moving.  No.  It will never move.  It's stuck.  This whole thing's a joke, isn't it?  I thought so, but too much went into this thing.  Like, you could tell it was built.  And there's more videos like that.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, there's other people from Kenya  that tried to build planes and helicopters.  But that, on the heels of watching  the Apollo program documentaries, 
[02:28:30]  was just...  It's amazing.  And that was 1960s.  Early 60s they started that.  And this is 2013 in Zimbabwe.  That guy has actually got a motor  that spins a propeller, though, pretty quick.  But then he's using, like, you know,  heavy nuts and bolts.  You titled this video  The Wrong Brothers.  Yeah, yeah.  It was The Wrong Brothers.  See, as opposed to The Right Brothers.  The Wrong Brothers.  Here's the test of the last aircraft 
[02:29:00]  that he made.  Look, it weighs 8 million pounds.  The tail knocked the one African gentleman  in the ass and he fell down.  They were pushing it.  This is great.  Oh, boy.  But I don't know.  Hey, maybe in 500 years, maybe,  they'll have powered flight.  You don't think they'll be able 
[02:29:30]  to push it into the sky?  No.  I don't think so.  Everything...  They have no...  There's no concept here  of weight-to-lift ratio, you know?  There's...  You need a lot of lift  Yeah.  for the amount of weight  that's going into that.  So, um...  See?  They started working on the weight, but...  All right.  They're made-up sciences.  Thanks.  Yes, yes.  I don't think they...  He said he's not trying  to reinvent the wheel here. 
[02:30:00]  He's just trying to...  Reinvent the plane.  ...go off of technology  that's already out there.  Which it is.  I mean, I'm sure you can pop up people  that have actually built kit airplanes  by themselves in their garage,  um, and they actually fly.  Sure.  Not those ones, though.  No.  Not the guy from Zimbabwe  or from, uh, Kenya.  No.  I don't know.  You can't put shopping cart wheels  on the plane and expect it to...  No.  You can't pick up enough speed to...  They were rubber baby buggy bumper wheels. 
[02:30:30]  Rubber baby buggy bumpers.  Yeah, and then there's that video  of the martial arts guy.  Oh, this...  Have you seen this one, Jim?  It's hilarious.  This guy was doing a demonstration,  and, uh, all he's got to do  is, I guess, break these, um...  What amount to be 10 by 10  or one foot by one foot boards.  I couldn't tell if this guy  was more like Rex Kwon Do  or, like, Danny McBride  in foot-fist way.  He's trying to break it,  and he just keeps  smashing his hand  into the wood.  The guy's holding it.  Now he decides  he's going to try to kick it 
[02:31:00]  with a front kick.  It doesn't break again.  He's got to adjust  where it is, like,  you weren't holding it right.  Is he doing an example  for people?  Yes, he's doing a little show  for a bunch of people  who you will see shortly,  because the camera  will go in that direction.  He's kicking now.  He's got two people  holding the board.  Oh, and a piece of wood flew  and hit a little girl  in the face.  And now she's crying.  And it hit her in the nose.  And she's crying.  But it doesn't stop  the demonstration. 
[02:31:30]  Why would it?  He's now got two guys  holding this board,  and he's going to do  this spinning back kick.  Very impressive.  It didn't break.  It didn't break.  He's going to try it again.  He's got to take his shoes off.  He fucked up.  The shoes are the problem.  He left his shoes on.  Here we go now.  Ah!  Again, he kicks it  and it doesn't break.  It missed.  And he just kicked  the guy's hand.  And now the guy is injured.  That's holding the board.  The worst karate.  It's karate, Jerry.  Karate. 
[02:32:00]  He's so bad at karate.  Well, we're all  at the same skill level.  Yeah.  And he's still trying.  He's not breaking any.  Now he takes that board  because that was a bad board.  Yeah, it's the board's board.  And he picked up  a new board.  You want the perforated line.  Yes.  Although, he can't  break this one either.  It's the worst  demonstration ever.  Ah!  With my dojo!  What's it called?  What's it called?  Yeah.  It's called.  It's called  Possibly Worst Taekwondo  Martial Arts Demo Ever.  He winds up  injuring two people.  One a little girl. 
[02:32:30]  Not breaking a board.  He probably hurt himself, too.  I already broke his hand.  Well, I was watching  one of these  where a guy  was trying to break  these logs,  it looked like,  that were about...  They were about  three inches diameter.  These little logs  with his shins.  And he was laying  his shins  into these things  so fucking hard  and they weren't breaking.  and all I was thinking  is how painful...  I don't care  what the fuck you know  as far as 
[02:33:00]  Taekwondo or  Kirate  goes.  That's gotta hurt.  He's gonna have  bruised shins  for weeks.  And shin bumps  and fucking like...  Yeah.  Just that pain  in your shin.  It's a horrid pain.  Why would you do that?  Ah, he was trying  to look like  a tough guy.  And did he?  No, he looked  like an idiot.  He looked like  a guy that fucking  was hurting his shins.  Like a puss boy?  Like a pussy.  You gotta learn  how to do that stuff.  It's a certain way  you put the energy 
[02:33:30]  and you turn  your talking stuff.  How do you know?  I did a lot of karate.  Oh, did you?  I could break  like 17 boards.  He didn't.  He didn't.  You stack them up  I just fucking  crack them.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Karate is here  here  and here  Karate.  That was  a terrible display.  Yeah, I can't  when they take their head  and slam it  into cinder blocks  and it's supposed  to break  and it doesn't break 
[02:34:00]  you just gotta know  that's not going  to feel good.  It's funny to watch though.  Ah!  Remember Master Paul?  How could I forget?  When he would do  his demonstrations  at the studio.  I miss him terribly.  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes when I  I'll tell you now  Yeah.  Sometimes when I  talk to him  and about him  I was being sarcastic  some of the time  with him.  What?  Yeah, when I talked  about how great  Body Rock was. 
[02:34:30]  I never  even caught  the sarcasm.  There were times  when I was being sarcastic.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'll admit to it.  I'll cop to it now.  Ah.  What was?  Remember when he came up  with the hurricane  evacuation plan?  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because he was  told that he  he would be told  that he's got  these responsibilities  and then take them  to the umpteenth level.  Well, we also made up  the responsibilities  because we knew  that he would take them  to the umpteenth level. 
[02:35:00]  He set them up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Steve brought them  into the producer's booth  back at XM  and recorded a walkthrough  and told them  he was the head  of, like,  security  and safety.  Which, by the way,  we could have used  some of his tips  when Hurricane Sandy came.  Yes.  Right?  You know?  Oh, man,  he was great  with making sure  we had an evacuation plan  for a hurricane  in Manhattan  in a building  where you're  completely safe.  Well... 
[02:35:30]  We were more  in the middle  of the island  as we could ever be.  Probably at the highest  point of Manhattan.  Yeah.  And, um...  I mean, literally,  we were at the part  where even Sandy  devastated surrounding areas.  Yeah.  Didn't touch Midtown.  Didn't touch Midtown.  It was rainy.  But he was there  to evacuate people.  Why would you leave?  Just stay put.  Yeah.  Get a hotel.  Have fun.  Our own Roland  would always mix it up 
[02:36:00]  with Master Poe, too.  If you remember.  There was one time  when, uh...  Poe...  I guess he was trying  to get in on  the Tickle Roland gag.  Yeah.  Everybody tickled him  because he laughed.  And Poe did it  too aggressively.  Yes.  Yes.  So that got Roland  very upset.  Yeah.  And Roland said,  Hey, how are your dogs?  Oh, that's right.  They're dead.  They're dead.  And then he kept making  woof-woof sounds.  Yeah, just really insensitive.  To Poe.  And Poe loved those dogs.  Well, apparently. 
[02:36:30]  He lived with them, I guess.  Or slept with them  at the studio.  Right.  But didn't he sleep  in the office a few times  with the dogs?  A few times.  Remember when he wanted  the password  or he wanted a fucking, uh...  He wanted the computer  that we put all the music on?  He wanted a dilette machine.  A dilette machine  so he can...  And he just said,  he goes,  Why?  Well, so I can make tapes.  Well, first he said  he needed it  for security reasons.  Yeah.  And then we pressed him  on it and he said  it was because he wanted  to make mixes  for his body rock. 
[02:37:00]  He just wanted  free music.  Danny told me once  that when the show  first started,  he would have  Danny and Nathaniel  scan feedback  for curse words  because he would  consider them threats.  It must have been  every single one then.  Everyone's threatening  you guys.  One time Poe  issued a complaint  against Travis  because he was disrespectful  except he didn't know  Travis's last name.  And so,  in the letter of complaint  that he wrote  to our executive producer 
[02:37:30]  at the time,  he referred to him  as Mr. Travis.  Oh, boy.  And that letter  is proudly still  in my office.  Is it?  Yeah.  Mr. Travis,  what did you do  that was disrespectful?  Silly me.  I was doing show prep  before the show  and he wanted me  to print something  that could have  waited 10 minutes.  Oh, some stupid  job that he had?  Yeah.  He waited 10 days.  Yeah, he wanted me  to print guest release  forms or something  for someone that  wasn't coming in  for hours.  And I was like,  yeah, I'll do it later. 
[02:38:00]  And I disrespected him.  That's very disrespectful.  Eras, remember how  Poe was supposed  to be checking everybody  in, but he didn't  know celebrities?  Yes.  So he asked me,  this Aerosmith,  are they a big deal?  A big deal.  This Aerosmith.  When was he checking  them in?  Where?  When they weren't  even going to be there.  There was something  else going on,  but he just pulls me  aside and asks if  Aerosmith is a big deal.  Remember the IDs  from the girls  that would come in?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm a ladies man. 
[02:38:30]  Let me make a copy  of this ID  and take it with me.  Phone number,  fucking.  Would he use them?  Oh, yes.  So, because we have  this system where we  scanned IDs and copied  them, so we had a record  of who was coming in  the studio, but we just  kept them on file in the  office.  And they were constantly  getting reorganized and  refiled by interns.  However, you're saying  that there was a little  extra copy of the female  IDs made.  Let me run off a copy of  this one here.  I heard some IDs got 
[02:39:00]  lost.  Lost, huh?  And then were driven  to the home to be  returned.  Oh, wow.  Wait.  That's just what I've  heard.  That's creepy.  I never saw that.  Like the actual license?  That's what I've heard.  How do you say we lost  it within the three  fucking minutes that  they got a...  I remember when we  went to get...  Sleight of hand.  Yes.  Magic.  Jim, remember when we  got X-Men pictures  upstairs and Poe came?  No.  The armpits?  Wasn't it Fantastic 
[02:39:30]  Four?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  It's sweaty.  He had sweaty...  And he put his arm  around Jessica Alba.  Remember when all he  would wear would be  like a tank top?  Yes.  And shorts?  And you'd see the big  rings of sweat under  his arms.  Yeah, he'd put his  arms around these  people.  Yeah.  And then Jessica Alba  got a nice wet  armpit.  A wet Poe pit on  her shoulder.  Oh, God damn.  Did she say it?  She said something,  didn't she?  Yeah, I think she  made like...  She's disgusted. 
[02:40:00]  I don't know if he  was the right pick  for the job.  No?  I think he was.  I used to like his  demonstrations when he  would slap all over  himself.  Well, him and his  best friend Mars  used to do it  together.  Didn't you think  that him and Mars  were best friends?  They were.  Mars got him the  job.  Yeah, Mars got him  the job.  They used to hang  out all the time.  Well, then why does  Mars try to make it  seem like...  He wants to be part  of the group.  Who's that over there  now?  Why are these  curtains?  Let's open the  fucking curtain.  We're celebrities.  You know, they're so  fast to close the 
[02:40:30]  curtains when we have  a naked girl up on  the computer.  How about you pay  attention and when  the naked girl's off  the computer, you open  the goddamn curtain  back up.  Got time for that?  All right, who's that?  Yeah.  Whoa, we are.  Who is that?  There's an action  going on.  There is action.  There's like fucking...  Who's all these people?  I don't know.  I see somebody that  looks...  Wow, he looks like a  problem.  Oh, who is this guy?  He's a big guy.  He is a big guy.  Is he a performer or  is he with a performer?  I don't know.  He looks like security.  It looks to be Chris 
[02:41:00]  Colfer from Glee.  Oh, he's from Glee?  The big guy?  No, the big guy.  No, the big guy would  be his security.  Why is he security?  You're not going to  beat him up.  I don't know.  He's a very popular  youngster on the program.  Chris Colfer?  From Glee, yeah.  Why don't we have him?  Because we bring the  opposite to people's  lives.  Yes.  If there was a show  called Glum.  You see?  That's the opposite.  Absolutely.  We're all laughing at  Master Poe's video now. 
[02:41:30]  Where...  And by the way,  he had an intern at  this video for him  from the show.  Where is this video  found?  Please, please.  Can we put it on  our Facebook?  Of course we can.  This is...  Classic Poe.  He really is doing  a good job with  those nunchucks,  though.  I mean, he's fucking...  No, he's not.  He's going really fast  to make you think  he's doing a good job.  Yeah, he's got...  I can do that.  It's just one of those  sword thingies  that they use.  Do you remember  we convinced him  Chuck Norris was  going to be there  that day?  Yeah.  One day.  Oh, yeah.  You see a row? 
[02:42:00]  That's like how  you fool a child.  Chuck Norris is showing up.  We convinced him  Chuck Norris was  coming in,  and then we had him  write and read aloud  a page-long thing  about Chuck Norris.  Chuck Norris  influenced his life.  Are those nunchucks?  No, those are like...  Swords.  Oh.  So much time  was spent  fucking with Poe.  It's like,  yeah, we had him  write up something,  and...  Oh, man.  Because he had  so much free time.  I don't know why  he's wearing sunglasses,  but...  Because it looks 
[02:42:30]  cool that way.  Never showed up.  Where have you been?  Yeah.  I like the editing.  There's this  wavy transition  that he's been using.  Mother of that.  He's got, like,  some kind of  backdrop going on.  Where was this done?  Well, what's great is  he's got the backdrop  going on,  but it's out of frame,  so you can see  on the left side  of the screen  where the backdrop ends.  There's a desk there.  Let's see.  Now he's just slapping...  He slaps himself.  Oh, he just did a roll.  You people,  you've got to look  at this video.  It's called 
[02:43:00]  Master Pose Demo 2006.  What's this?  What is he doing?  He's dusting him.  It looks like  he's dusting.  I never, ever  understood  how this was  proper security.  I've never...  Look at it.  He's doing like a...  Like, just...  He's moving so...  I can't even  describe this.  He's moving his hands  at lightning speed  over this guy,  but it's not  doing anything.  You'd think you could 
[02:43:30]  just sock him  in the stomach.  Right.  That was seven years ago.  That was seven years ago.  Jesus.  That was great.  Wow, Drew Boogie  with the music, huh?  I guess so.  Oh, how about that?  Wow, that was...  Pathetic.  The top two comments  are pathetic  and this guy  is pure garbage.  Pure garbage?  That's such an insult.  Yeah, that's not good.  Oh, that's fucking great. 
[02:44:00]  The Poe years.  How long was he with us?  From 2004.  Four to six or...  No, wait.  48.  Yeah, eight.  Really?  It was that long?  Right as the merger,  he was...  Dude, he was there  for four years?  At least.  Because he used to,  when we were at K-Rock,  he used to just spend  the three or four hours  that we were at K-Rock  just sitting...  Oh, right.  And the XM officers...  Falling asleep.  Because K-Rock wanted  nothing to do with it.  I liked him, though.  I liked the security teams.  I used to play chess  with him every day.  I liked Poe.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember how... 
[02:44:30]  Sam?  Remember how mad he got  when somebody was  stealing his chess piece?  Yes!  Off the board.  Who was it?  He goes,  enough of this shit.  Was it Sam?  I don't remember,  but it very well  could have been me.  Yeah, because he'd have  these games set up.  And I guess Jim would play  and Poe would play,  but they couldn't finish  the game,  so they'd just leave it.  And Jim would come out  like during a break  and do a move.  But in between that time,  somebody would steal pieces.  Who took the chess piece? 
[02:45:00]  Someone took my rook.  I think all of us  would be moving him around.  I did not move that bit.  He always looks for  one fact to tell  each celebrity.  I like your movie.  Which one?  And he goes,  the only one I read about.  I got that one.  I know.  Oh, and then this was like  some fan came in  and wanted to wrestle Poe  and actually gave  some random dude  just gave Poe  a run for his money.  Oh, right, right.  And he was like,  what? 
[02:45:30]  They were going to wrestle?  Is that what this was?  There was room back then  to do it.  Hey, look at all that space.  God.  All right,  he kind of backed Poe up.  He got Poe on the ground.  Poe with a little reverse.  He's trying to hook his leg.  Some fan.  He's not tapped yet.  Did he tap?  No.  Poe's also not  great at this.  No. 
[02:46:00]  Wow, yeah,  this guy's kind of  giving him a run.  Because Poe can't do  certain things.  Yeah.  You can do that here now.  Imagine that, right?  Yeah, but Poe could put him  in like a quick choke hold  and not knock him out  or wrap his arm  or something like that.  Yeah.  Look at the audience  and the fucking giant room.  At least we still,  you know.  But he still has  the same carpet.  Yeah,  we got the same rug  on the floor.  Great.  We have some TVs.  Yeah, yeah.  God, that's studio.  I was wondering  why that was  such an extreme close-up. 
[02:46:30]  And then I remembered  I think I was filming  and decided to shove  the camera in his face.  You really, really  gave him a hard time.  Yeah, I did.  I'm sorry about that.  Are you?  Yeah, yeah.  Master.  Looking back,  some of the things  I did were not necessary.  He used to insist  on walking me  to my car every day.  It's a black leather jacket.  And, yeah,  he'd walk me to my car  and after a while  I just started  using my phone  which I could get TV on.  I remember  that was the big thing.  You had some phone  which you got live 
[02:47:00]  Fox News on.  We thought that was  the most amazing thing  that you could watch TV  on your phone.  I was watching  fucking like Fox News  and stuff  and I'd just be like  watching it  or I'd fake that  I got a phone call.  That was another thing  I'd do.  I'd start just going  yeah, uh-huh, yeah.  And then I'd walk  because I just didn't  want to fucking talk to them.  It's so insulting  to be walking with somebody  and they're like  oh, I have live TV  on my phone.  Yeah.  So instead of talking to you  I'll just watch television  on my phone.  And it's not even  like I couldn't deal with it  for the fucking  three minute walk.  Yeah.  And the answer is 
[02:47:30]  no, I couldn't.  Because every time  you got to your car  he adjusted everything  that you had.  Your mirrors,  the radio,  the seats,  something with you  used to have your phone  tapped into the  to the car  so you could just  call while you were driving  and he'd mess that up.  Yes, every time  I would get in.  That's when he started  bringing the truck over.  Yeah.  And it was like  everything.  He'd fuck with every button  in my truck.  Everything.  There was a time  he had to get  enter David  got drunk 
[02:48:00]  at the Halloween party  and Poe  gave him a ride home.  But Poe  had to make  all these shady stops.  So it took him  like three hours  to get home.  Shady stops?  Yeah,  you had to stop  at somebody's house.  They had to stop  and get something to eat  and then  the end of the day  there's just drunk  sitting there like  what are we doing?  Why are we stopping here?  Wait a minute.  I have to stop here.  If you see  any movement  in that area  alert me.  Do you remember  when Pal Talk 
[02:48:30]  had that pajama party  and he was trying  to contact the girls  because he insisted  he had to run security  for their party?  Yes, yes.  I want to be there.  You need Master Poe.  I want to be in you.  Off to FH Riley's.  Oh God,  then there was  that FH Riley's story.  Oh yeah.  There was alleged  sexual contact  in the parking lot.  Wasn't that  Obie's classic line  that FH doesn't stand  for FH?  No, that was Anthony's. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, is that you?  Yeah, hold on.  Let me see if I have it.  Fuck here, Riley's.  I like that Eric  Eric has Master Poe jokes  like right on fire.  Like, yeah, yeah,  I think I have it right here.  Yeah, I think I got that one.  We haven't talked  about him in years.  We went to  Caroline's Christmas party  and I looked at  the list one year  and it said  Poe,  Master.  No.  Because he didn't  give out his real name.  No.  Wouldn't he go there  to free dinner?  Every night.  Yeah, he went every night  to get free steaks.  Mr. Charles. 
[02:49:30]  Call me Maestro.  That's not Master Poe.  Poe is like the maestro.  Oh, Master Poe.  I'll have the Poe clip  if you want.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear.  Master Poe,  and with all due respect, Poe,  you kind of would run  after a female dog  because it's female.  Wow.  You're kind of known  around this place  to be a little flirtatious,  to look at a lot  of the girls and stuff,  so it's hard to really gauge  how much, you know, 
[02:50:00]  if you're just being Poe.  Let's just put it this way.  He does a lot of his dating  in the back parking lot  at FH Ryder.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  Why is everyone looking away?  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, Poe,  the FH doesn't mean  fuck here.  Somebody wants to chime in  about Master Poe, actually.  Rick in Ohio.  Hey, didn't he at one time 
[02:50:30]  leave a prescription  for Viagra  in Anthony's car?  Yes, he did.  Yeah.  Hey, leave shit in there.  Fucking Viagra prescription.  Of all the things to leave  in Anthony's car.  Yeah.  I need my dick hard news.  He left every screen.  How humiliating.  He was the best.  Trying to be this tough guy,  just lying about everything,  and then he leaves  a prescription for Viagra. 
[02:51:00]  For Viagra.  I ruined his other jacket  by putting stickers  in the back.  And then it got to the point  where it really got shady  with girls that were  texting us  and emailing everyone  from the show  talking about how fucking  horrible he was.  I don't even know  what all those were.  He ended up getting  very serious, very fast.  Yes.  And Poe used to come in  and be like,  if you get any emails,  don't acknowledge  any of those. 
[02:51:30]  It's like,  don't acknowledge them.  We're all fucking  in the office  reading each one,  laughing our asses off.  How did they get our email?  Oh, they hacked into his thing.  Yeah.  Somebody hacked his account  because I'm like,  how the fuck  did they get my email?  Who is this?  But then we get new emails  like every like  four months or something  from a different email  and you're saying,  hey, just so you know.  Master Poe was doing  this and that and that.  Oh, boy.  I'd love to find out  his real story.  Yeah, my dojo's  in foreclosure.  Do you remember  the day he didn't show up  and then the next day 
[02:52:00]  he said he was  taking a personal day,  but I guess Keith  found out that he was  arrested.  What?  Oh, really?  Because of unpaid  traffic tickets,  his license was suspended.  Yeah.  Yeah, he didn't show up  and then we found out  that morning he was  in jail.  Ah.  And the bail was  like 200 bucks  and he couldn't pay it.  My favorite story,  though, is the dojo story  where he...  I wish I had that photo.  He got everybody  from...  Every autograph. 
[02:52:30]  What was it?  From a website or...  Yeah.  Yeah, one of the...  All in message boards.  Yeah.  One of the fan websites  and message boards  and whatnot  and got them all together  to do free work  at his dojo  to build his dojo.  And he offered him  like free lessons  or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll give you free lessons  when it's built.  And, oh, they all got together.  They had this big grand opening  with the balloons.  Yeah.  The balloon video  was the one  where he was trying 
[02:53:00]  to explain, like,  making mistakes in combat  and he kept popping balloons  going,  that's a mistake.  Pop.  That's a mistake.  Pop.  It was the craziest thing  you ever saw.  We have that?  I don't know.  It was never published.  All of his videos  are insane.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  We had a copy of it.  They're insane.  I still have all of these emails.  And then it turned out  that his dojo  that he got everyone  to work for free  and build  and he was going to do  was actually  on his ex's property.  So she put a stop 
[02:53:30]  to that immediately.  And then  a short time later,  it burned down.  Oh, wow.  And we had  a great picture  of just the cement stairs  leading to a pile  of burnt rubble.  Yeah.  To nothing.  And there's  the contrasting picture  of him in front  all happy  at the grand opening  and then burnt stairs  and nothing else. 
[02:54:00]  Everything was always  so shady.  There's a caller.  If you remember,  he did a Saturday night show  once.  Oh, yes.  The arena.  He filled the studio  with ex-cons.  He called it the arena  and then invited  like 30 or 40 fans.  Right.  Right.  Sean.  And he's like,  ah.  Oh, yes.  Didn't he have the guys  pull a bunch of audio drops  for the beginning of the show  and it was like  an hour long show.  Yes.  So he had miles  and miles of audio 
[02:54:30]  he wanted to do.  I need this.  I need this sound effect.  I need a movie clip.  Oh, that's right.  Yes.  And he invited up  a bunch of people  that he was like,  these are fighters  and masters  and they were all fucking  the scariest bunch  of ex-cons  that were like  looking around  casing the joint.  How much can I off  this piece of equipment for?  and literally had  dozens  of random fans out 
[02:55:00]  that nobody knew.  No one knew.  Nobody goes,  allegedly.  Yes.  And weapons.  Yeah, but his fists  are weapons.  Ah, lethal weapons.  Look how fast they move.  What a great  update to previous  virus notification.  Oh, yeah.  When the emails came  when the accusatory  emails came to us  he claimed he had a virus.  This is a computer virus. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Computer virus.  Say that, Bo.  I suggest you do not  open said emails  due to the infestation  of virus.  He didn't want us  to open them  to read them  because they were  he must have sat  and toyed like  how am I going to  keep them from  reading this about me?  Oh, I'll say it's a virus  and if they open it  I'm very crappy.  Did you open it anyway?  Of course.  I wonder if he had  a tortured life  or if he thought  he was just slick  all the time. 
[02:56:00]  I think he thought  he was very slick.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a fighter.  Their MO is to  draw you into  their trap of infections.  Oh.  Who said that?  Who do you think?  Yeah, what type  of language is that?  That was Poe  if you opened up  the email  you were going to  get a trap  of infections.  From women  accusing him  of things.  Yes.  Always.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy  was a fucking pisser.  I miss him.  I miss that whole  fucking time 
[02:56:30]  over there.  It was.  It was crazy  all that shit.  There's the Wild West  over there.  I mean it's fun  and all this  to love  love doing the show  but man  that was crazy  over there.  It was brand new  like fucking  satellite radio  who knew what?  What is that?  This is the list  of all the sound effects  he wanted for his show.  Wow, you actually  have those?  I keep everything.  What does he need?  Muhammad Ali  spelled completely  incorrectly.  Float like a butterfly  and all his chants 
[02:57:00]  before and after a fight.  All of them?  Chuck Norris  his views on how  martial arts have evolved.  What the fuck?  Bruce Lee  his views on combat  and why he developed  Jeet Kune Do.  Did you get these  clips from him?  No.  This was forwarded  to me from an intern.  Did the interns get them?  I don't know.  I would think not.  Macho Camacho  his chants before  or after he fights someone.  Tyson  his chants before  or after he fights someone.  What the fuck?  What's he talking about? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, what is a chant  when he probably  spelled a C-A-H  H-A-N-C  Yeah, a chance.  End the sound bit  with the scene  from Braveheart  while he is in his cell.  Not every man dies  but not every man lives.  Oof.  Oh my god!  This is terrible!  Mixed with the scene  from 300  it's an honor  to die by your side  and his reply is  it was an honor  to live by your.  Wait!  He actually wanted these.  300.  Wow!  Download the scene  in Troy  before the Spartans  crash through the door 
[02:58:00]  and he tells his soldiers  it has been an honor  to battle by your side  boys.  Something to that effect.  Oh.  The end scene  in Braveheart  where William Wallace  is lying on his back  with an arrow in him  I think  and his friends  are saying goodbye  goodbye  by the way  spelled  G-O-O-D  space B-U-Y  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Viagra is a goodbye.  Goodbye.  Paul wanted all these clips  for a show  that was a one-off  maybe two hours  but possibly one hour.  Right.  For an intro.  This was all for the intro.  This is for the intro. 
[02:58:30]  Oh my god.  This is just the intro.  The movie Alamo  before the last battle scene  they may have said something  to prepare them for battle.  I don't know.  They may have said something.  Get me that clip.  One would imagine.  The movie Gladiator  before the scene  when he is in the woods  and he tells the Roman soldier  the frost  sometime the blades  stick in the cold  or something like that.  This is every  he wants every clip  of every moment  he's imagined himself  doing that.  It's such a long list.  Get the pinball machine 
[02:59:00]  clip from the accused.  Then at the end  a mixture of all the above  will give me  a beginning to the show.  Name of the show  Master Poe's Oosh Show.  Oosh.  If you have any ideas  let me know.  Remember the theme  of this show  will be strength and honor.  Holy shit.  Oh and then he has  a list of sounds  for the instant replay machine.  Oh he wanted to use  the instant replay.  Oosh.  Swords clashing.  Blocking and hitting.  The sound wind sound 
[02:59:30]  from a weapon  being wielded.  Like  someone yelling  while on the attack.  What the fuck?  Just amazing.  It's insanity.  Hey he was going to do  the fucking  Oosh Show.  Those were the days.  He did end up doing it  and he brought in  those convicts.  That was a wild time.  Just didn't know  what the fuck  was going on in there. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Everybody just  we weren't even  in the same building  in the same state.  Management was  literally  in Washington D.C.  Yeah they were  the doorman  hated everybody.  And we were  we hated him.  We hated the doorman.  Remember the doorman?  Dizzlery called  the doorman.  Every guest hated  that guy too.  Yeah yeah.  To all this is very serious.  Do not open any emails  from addresses  that are listed below.  Oh my god how many are there?  18.  I have just been notified  by Norton  of a virus being circulated

I am a victim.  He's made off  villains.  I love him.  He was a one of a kind.  And no one knows  what he's up to now?  Well this guy  some guy on the phone  does.  I don't know  if you want to go  to him or not.  Oh okay.  Sure.  We don't know  if this is true  or not.  What up yo?  Steve.  Hey buddy.  I don't know 
[03:01:30]  it looks like he might  be going now  by Master Rivera.  Oh yeah?  Okay good for him.  Master Rivera?  Does he have  a website?  Roberto Luis Rivera  dot com?  Roberto Luis Rivera  dot com?  Let's see.  There he is.  Oh no!  He's around  children.  It says  Master Rivera  trains kittens  into tigers  cubs into bears  fear  into courage.  Wow. 
[03:02:00]  New name  into new identity.  Can you go  to the testimonies?  Oh testimonies  let's see.  Contact form.  Oh yeah.  Oh okay.  There aren't any.  Maybe the website's  new sir.  I mean you know.  Maybe.  Is he photoshopped?  See if he mentions  his time at Sirius XM  in his bio.  No he does not.  He does not.  He wants that  era to be erased.  But he does mention  the name  Master Poe.  Oh Master Rivera.  He does?  Good. 
[03:02:30]  Does he mention  Bullshita?  Oh there he is.  There he is  at the arena.  With all the world's  warriors gathered  against us.  Hey.  This is the big intro.  Cool.  Do not forget  today's lesson.  Respecting us.  Respecting us.  We do what we were  trained to do.  What we were bred to do.  We'll put this together.  What we were born to do.  By Derek or Steve.  No prisoners.  I remember that  sweat jacket he's wearing  in the pictures.  Yeah he wore it every day.  This is where we hold them. 
[03:03:00]  This is where we fight.  This is where they die.  One shot.  Over the top.  It will be yours  for all time.  Never surrender.  Never retreat.  This is how he imagines  his life every day.  How dramatic.  Oh yeah.  This is awesome.  Yeah it is. 
[03:03:30]  I want this as our intro.  Let's steal this.  We're shitting on him  when he actually cared  about the intro to his show.  What an asshole  doing show prep  and trying to make it  sound right.  Yeah really.  Yeah.  Wow that's a cool  fucking intro right there.  That's pretty good.  Awesome.  Very epic.  His one off show  the arena.  Alright well good for him.  I hope he's doing well.  Yeah.  Yeah well.  I got no qualms. 
[03:04:00]  Where's that?  This fight is taking  fucking four hours  to make a chess move.  I still like him.  This looks like  what is that?  I think he had a  photos from a chair.  Look it's big A.  He had a dinner  before the arena.  So he just posted  all the photos.  Oh I recognize  a lot of these people.  Yes.  They're fans of the show.  Is he in New York?  I don't know.  I don't know where  this dojo is.  The last I saw  he was in Tampa  with Ralphie May  at a comedy club.  Oh yeah.  Shocker. 
[03:04:30]  Maybe they're dating.  I don't know about that.  Maybe they're dating.  It'd be funny  if him and Ralphie  were a couple.  Well that's great.  Well good for him.  It's been nice  this little trip  down memory lane.  I wish he would  come back and say hi.  I do wish him luck  and I hope he's good.  That's fine.  Wow look at the time.  That went really fast today.  Yeah.  All the way from me  getting fucked  by the goddamn  bridge and tunnel shithead  right up to  Master Poe  and everything in between. 
[03:05:00]  Oh boy.  Tell your friends  about the replay.  They're going to love it.  I have one plug.  What Jimmy?  What?  I'll be at the  Gathering of the Juggalos  this Friday night  on the 11 o'clock show  and actually  the 23rd  my special comes out  I'm going to start  promoting that now.  I'm going to LA next week  and doing a whole shitload  of podcasts  while we're off.  Nice.  I hear the week  of the release  and I'm very psyched.  Very cool man.  Yeah I hope people like it.  Do you think  you're going to get  a blowjob  at the Juggalos thing?  No.  Why?  Because I'll go in  I hear it's very easy. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah I know  whenever I hear  that it jinxes me  so I'll go in  here's what will happen.  Uh huh.  I will do my show.  Right.  I will get back  and get a message  from Sharon  saying Ozzy was asking  to go to dinner  and I'll realize  that I was away.  But if you get  Saturday I'll say  hey I'll go down  to Philly  and I'll fuck up again  and I'll be in the wrong place.  Oh no.  And then Sunday  I go to LA  to do podcasts.  So let's be honest  it has been a wonderful  slash humiliating week. 
[03:06:00]  No.  I think if you  do the show  and then you have  your all access pass  I honestly think  you could just get girls  to suck your dick.  Dude I hope you're right.  I hope you're right.  I had a Sabbath  all access pass.  I couldn't get  to the right area.  Right.  But that is different.  And I was allowed.  Yeah.  Anywhere I wanted to go  I could have moseyed.  So if you just didn't  go to the right place.  I didn't know what to do.  I panicked again. 
[03:06:30]  Terrible instincts.  Dude I am  literally  the fucking  the worst.  Those are bad instincts.  Very bad instincts.  I just want to get  my prick tugged.  My prick?  I want to get my prick milked.  That's what I say to a girl.  You want to milk my prick?  Prick.  It's the worst.  It is right?  Yeah.  Do you have time  for a kiss Sam?  No you're not.  What's coming up next?  After Opie and Anthony  live starts.  Wow.  Matt Roberts.  Wow.  Yeah.  People you don't even  know how lucky you are.  Yes.

I hope you had a good weekend.  Eric did you do anything fun  this weekend? 
[03:08:30]  Uh  I was doing a lot of family stuff.  You always got family stuff  going on.  Yeah because I got a lot of family.  In the area?  No.  One was in Pennsylvania  one was out in Long Island.  See  this is where I'm so lucky.  All my extended family  is like  really spread out  across the country.  I got a bunch of family  in the Detroit area.  I got  some family  in Kentucky.  I got family  out in Florida.  I got them in California.  But they're not  you know  I don't have any sort of  east coast  tri-state area  extended family 
[03:09:00]  to speak of.  So  I don't ever end up  having to do that stuff.  But for you  it seems like  at least twice a month  you gotta devote  a weekend  to someone's family.  Yeah but I also have  family too  that even though  they live around the country  they do travel  all the time.  So they come up here  they go down to  Florida  they go out to California.  My family stays put.  Yeah.  My  parents went to Detroit  this weekend  to see my  grandma  and  my uncle's  getting married too. 
[03:09:30]  They were making  a weekend out of it.  And I guess  this was the moment  where I got to be an adult  and I think I made  the right decision  cause  my parents were like  are you coming?  And I go where?  And they go to Detroit  where you know  see your grandma.  And I go what do you mean?  And they go like  are you gonna get a plane ticket?  And I go  are you gonna come with us?  I was like  fuck no.  What no  I'm not gonna go  I'm gonna go  and buy a plane ticket?  No I got stuff going on.  I got things to do.  And so they went without me 
[03:10:00]  but I think  I think I made the right call.  Of course you did.  I did right?  Yeah.  Why go if you don't have to?  No just stuck there.  Yeah yeah  what's the choices given to you?  Now do you end up  having to do more family stuff  with your family  or your wife's family?  Both.  It's kind of equal?  It is kind of equal.  What do you like better?  They're both fine.  Come on.  What do you like better?  Neither.  There you go.  You don't like either one of them.  You don't have a preference though  because I think it's interesting  because some  you know  I guess the stereotype  is to say  you know  oh my in-laws are impossible 
[03:10:30]  but at the same time  nobody likes hanging out  with their own family.  You don't have a preference  one or the other?  Nah.  You should.  Nah.  You gotta make choices  in this life.  I know  and then you gotta  sort out holidays  and other things  of where you're going  for which side of the family.  Yeah you're right.  Yeah.  So we're in that process  probably this month  start booking  for our holiday stuff.  Oh my god  that sounds like  an undertaking.  It is.  I wouldn't want  any part of that.  I did have fun  this weekend though 
[03:11:00]  at one of the places  I was at  it was a graduation party  and they had a bunch  of other stuff  set up for  little kids.  What graduation?  High school  going into college.  Alright.  So you got a little  barely legal pussy.  No this is family.  So they have all there  but there's also  a lot of little kids  in the family  so they had  stuff set up  for the little kids.  Yeah.  They had a big  inflatable bouncy house.  You didn't pop a bouncy house  this weekend did you Eric?  I did not pop it.  No.  I just  I saw 
[03:11:30]  that's where I thought  it was going.  But I did wait  for when they were  serving cake  so all the kids  ran over there  and I went into  the bouncy house  myself.  You went in?  Yeah I took a video  I put it up online.  Where is it?  It's up on  Iraq Radio on Twitter.  Did the bouncy castle moan?  Was it like a horror movie?  No.  It was made for adults.  The bouncy castle was?  Yeah.  They make bouncy castles  for adults?  They make them for adults  so that the little kids  can use them  but the parents  can go in  with the little kids.  Oh and you  on the other hand  were like 
[03:12:00]  well I'll just go in  by myself.  Well I didn't want  to go in there  with little kids  and I don't have  a little kid.  No you can't go in  there with little kids  yeah that's bad.  You got to keep  boundaries but so  when  Especially  I was going to say  even if they're  your family  but especially  if they're your family.  You know what I mean?  Because that molestation  is constantly happening  within the family.  You don't want to be  Not in my family.  I'm saying in families  in general.  Yes but not in my  kind of family.  Yeah but you don't  want to be the funny uncle.  No.  You know?  No no.  Not at all.  I don't know if we  invite uncle  although it'll get you 
[03:12:30]  out of a few invitations.  That is true  but I'm not looking  to take the hard way  out of things.  Maybe not.  But no as soon as  they all ran off  for cake and everything  I ran right into  the bouncy house myself.  It had a slide in it.  You strategized  so you could get  the maximum amount  of bouncy time?  I've been eyeing  that thing since  I got there.  That's unbelievable.  There's no part of you  that was like  that's humiliating.  I don't want to  go into a bouncy castle.  No I had cousins  that went in there too.  They all went in.  Adult cousins?  Yeah.  Alright well then I can see  that.  Did your wife go in? 
[03:13:00]  Did she?  No she did not.  But she didn't  think less of you?  No not at all.  I could see.  I guess if you go  I thought you were  going in by yourself  like oh who's with me?  And everybody's like  no we're gonna  eat cake now.  That's for the children.  No.  Some of her cousins  their husbands  we all went in  it was fun.  And you all just  jump around  pretending that you  don't have to live  this adult life  that you're all sick of?  Exactly.  You live your life  to that point  like the way you have  these like escapist things  and I know  we're all guilty of it 
[03:13:30]  I have my own little escapist  because I'm into wrestling  just as much as you are  but as much escapism  as you have in your life  with your treats  and your cartoons  and your bouncy castles  and everything  like you really live life  like you have  a 9 to 5 office job  that you're trying to escape.  You don't live life  as if you're  like you already have  a fun job.  Yeah I do.  So you shouldn't have  to go home  and  But I'm not miserable  when I go home.  No no no  I don't think you're miserable.  It's just a lot of people  who end up going 
[03:14:00]  doing these things  that are escapist activities  Yeah but see that's  have miserable jobs  and so they go home  and try to forget about it  with you know  See that's the difference  they're trying to escape  from their lives  This is my life.  This is just what I do.  So you're sitting there  telling me  you know  you know that thing you do  that escapist thing  that you do  to escape your life  Yeah.  That is my life.  24-7.  You're living the dream.  You are the kid  from blank check.  I'll pull the car over  if I see one of those 
[03:14:30]  miniature golf  go-kart track combos  Yeah.  That's where I'm going  for the day.  That's it.  I'm there.  You're an adult.  Yep.  You're driving around  and you've reached  the point  where you're  you're an adult  you're making  a handsome wage  you can treat yourself  at this point  I'm going to stop  at that  it's not planned  but I'm going to go  ahead and stop  at mini golf.  Yeah why not?  They got a volcano.  So you really are  you are the escape.  No I think work  is the escape  from my life.  Because it's too much 
[03:15:00]  pleasure?  Yeah.  I need to calm down  sometimes.  So it's like  I gotta figure out  how to act  like a regular person.  Are you slowly  kind of trying  to adapt your house  to make it  into more of a fun house?  Oh yeah.  Like just adding  like oh what if  we make this mirror  a little curvy?  What if we put  a maze in the back?  What if we  I was playing  with bluetooth speakers  to figure out  which ones I'm going  to put in the backyard  for when I do  the outdoor movie theater.  That's right.  You did a few months back  say that you're going  to put in an outdoor  movie theater.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  You are.  You are living the life  of the kid in blank check.  Yeah.  Brian Bonsall  from Family Size?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not the life he has now  because now he's  a complete disaster.  Yeah.  Google image his mug shots  because he's not doing well.  But back then  when a million dollars  could get you  apparently five billion  worth of stuff.  Yeah.  You have your own  limo driver  that looks like  they couldn't get  Chris Farley  to play him  so they got  the next best thing.  I don't know  who that guy was.  He was a fat guy  who looked like  Chris Farley.  Oh.  Probably get him 
[03:16:00]  a lot cheaper  and you're trying  to get that  did you  have you seen  that movie?  Blank Check?  Yeah.  When it came out  You gotta watch it again  because that is  a creepy movie.  Is it?  I was watching it  not too long ago.  That's right  we all have our own  little crosses to bear.  I have it on DVD.  But  Nothing wrong with that.  Thank you Eric.  Thank you very much.  I'll back you up  on that one.  There's nothing wrong  with sitting down  on a Sunday afternoon  with a Coke float  and watching Blank Check  is there?  Nothing.  Good.  Who doesn't enjoy that 
[03:16:30]  and then Mighty Ducks?  Yeah and maybe D2  depending on what time  it is.  Some Sandlot?  I love the Sandlot.  But I was watching  Blank Check  and you know  the female lead  who's in the movie  I think her name's  like  it might be Charlie.  She was on MTV  she did House of Style  she was like  in 94  she was the hottest  chick there was.  She had kind of  short black hair  she was on MTV  Oh Duff  Karen Duff  Karen Duffy  she was in all the  all the Revlon commercials  and everything 
[03:17:00]  she's the female lead  and like  the Blank Check kid  I think his name was  Preston in the movie  Preston Waters  right  is taking her like  out on dates  and he's wearing a tuxedo  and if you watch  that movie now  and Eric  I challenge you  to watch it again  I think I'll have to  because  I don't know  if it was the director  or the screenwriter  but somebody  added in  and you don't pick up  on it as much  when you're a kid  but when you're an adult  you get it  there is an  uncomfortable layer  of sexual tension 
[03:17:30]  between the 11 year old  and the like  30 year old  that's awesome  because it's not  like if it were a guy  and a girl reversed  if it were an older man  and then a young  whatever  11 year old girl  who had a million dollars  and they had that  whole thing going on  it would be a pedophile movie  yes  there's even a  a scene in the movie  where they  she kisses him  it's not a deep tongue kiss  but it's like a kiss  on the lips  that's not like  a kiss your mom gives you  there's  there's tongue  no not quite 
[03:18:00]  but there's a weird  sort of  underlying  lying  pedophilic  sexual tension  that's just  existing  and as the movie  is going on  they're treating it  like you would  treat a rom-com  like oh  you know  if only things  were different  we would be together  well that's not  what you say  to somebody  who's a preteen  well look  he's got a million dollars  he's living the life  yeah he's living the life  good for him  but teachers go to jail  for that  yeah 
[03:18:30]  female teachers  yeah that's what I'm talking about  Karen Duffy  it's a hideous crime  and that's what she was committing  no no  that they go to jail for that  oh  I see  your issue is  with the legal system  yes  because these kids  are obviously loving  this is totally acceptable  it was  it was uncomfortable  to me  what would you do  if you had  you have  oh my god  and he comes home  he has a million dollar check  and Karen Duffy  I would look at him  and say son  when I was 11  and Karen Duffy  was on TV  I was popping 
[03:19:00]  my first little  junior boners  over her  good on ya buddy  good on ya  his voice is all deep  yeah all of a sudden  he's more masculine  than I am  overnight  what happened  well I met this girl  Karen Duffy  yeah but she was popular  in 94  she's like 60 now  she's still on the prowl  yeah  she's a big time cougar now  what was your favorite  of those  era  because that was like  when Blank Check came out  in like the 90s  there was this whole era  there was like a golden era  of kid movies 
[03:19:30]  that are actually  holed up  like to me  the movie Heavyweight  it's a Disney movie  starring Ben  what was that  what was that  is that you  I love that movie  oh Jackie just I guess  freaked out  because she loved that movie  is that the sound  girls make when they're excited  I've never heard it before  go in there  she's coming  is that what  is that  Heavyweight's  starring Ben Stiller  and if you look  at the DVD box  it's written by  Judd Apatow  wow  yeah  no I'll have to watch that 
[03:20:00]  I haven't seen that one  like it's in my top 10  best movies of all time  it's a great movie  not a great kids movie  a great movie in general  Jackie you loved it  that's why you squealed  yeah it was  because I just DVR'd it  a couple weeks ago  and I've been watching it  did you watch it  because I told you to watch it  no it's been one  of my favorite movies  good excellent  oh yeah  Roland's just texted me  from the back  because he's too lazy  to stand up  and walk down a hallway  from the back  or the bathroom  probably on the shitter  the fountain scene  in blank  he just wrote  the fountain scene 
[03:20:30]  in blank check  oh yeah  yeah  have you seen  blank check  oh yeah  definitely  you have  and recently  but I didn't pick up  on the sexual tension  you're really  you're very well versed  in early 90's comedy  for somebody  who's very young  well I had  my sister's 6 years  older than me  and my brother's 7  ok so they were  yeah so they had  clueing you in  VHS  Roland's right actually  do you remember  this scene Eric  it's the quintessential  it's almost a  sleepless in Seattle  esque scene 
[03:21:00]  where Karen Duffy  and little  the kid from  Family Ties  not Michael J Fox  the little kid  from Family Ties  are running  through a fountain  holding hands  oh yeah  and it's like  it's the water  that shoots up  from the ground  but it's a romantic  scene is it not  it is  not from 11  yeah she's wearing  a really  you're watching  Eric  I'm watching  Eric's watching  the scene  alright Eric  watch this scene  alright yeah  they're running  through this fountain  that shoots  the water up  sort of like  what Disney has  where they shoot up  in little different 
[03:21:30]  spouts  and they jump around  and everything  and it's shooting  up her dress  that scene  is running through  and they're holding  hands  that scene  is probably  why Roland  got drunk  and tried to  jump into the fountain  in Las Vegas  and almost broke  his leg  is there not  even just watching it  Eric with no audio  is there not  a thick degree  of sexual tension  it's like  yeah  it's a cum reference  is what it is  it's a big cum reference  you think the fountains  are referencing  ejaculate  mhm 
[03:22:00]  it's little kids  running through  with the woman  of his dreams  and cumming  and all the water  shooting up  he's got  his balls  haven't even dropped yet  no the kid  doesn't know this  but they gotta put  stuff in there  so the parents  will watch it  you've seen  Blank Check rolling  oh yeah  is that not  when you look back  on it now  is that how you got  the cum on your shirt  is that not  there is a little  cum on your shirt  we mentioned that earlier  it's for Karen Duffy  that is  is that not  the craziest shit  you ever seen  in your life  yeah cause when  they were both  getting wet  it's like her dress  is getting tighter 
[03:22:30]  and she's hugging him  and they're laughing  spinning around  in the water  and she's not like  hugging him like  a big sister  or a maternal  it's not a maternal hug  it's not like  and they're holding hands  yeah  in some scenes  it's that sexy  I'm falling on you  kind of drunk in love  like Karen Duffy  is sitting there  Eric's got some weird  things going on  in his head  but Eric really does  live in his own world  and I'm starting to  respect that more  and more every day  but Karen Duffy  like the vibe  is almost like  oh you know 
[03:23:00]  I never thought  it would happen  but Preston  I'm falling for you  and us as the audience  are supposed to  forget the fact  that he's 11 years old  and he tried to do  a lot of stuff  to impress her  with the money  yeah  to make her happy  yeah  he's taking her out  he's like any of us  Roland  he's like any of us  taking a chick out  except you know what  we should have a better  shot with these chicks  than we do  cause we're not 11  unfortunately  we don't  Preston  is over there  getting all the tail  Preston Waters  enough of that 
[03:23:30]  Preston  go to the motels  I wonder what he thinks  watching it now  if he's like  like if he watches it now  and he's like  oh I so could have had her  at 11  I wonder  I wonder  if he puts that movie  cause he's fucked up now  like he's got all kinds  of tattoos  he's got mug shots  out there  I wonder  if when he got  to a certain age  he put that movie in  and he realized  he was molested  I wonder if he realized  at that moment  he was sexually abused  for the purpose  of a Disney film  who knows  I'm buying it on Amazon 
[03:24:00]  you're literally purchasing  it as we speak  $10  get it  it's so worth it  with Amazon Prime  so we can get a report  from you later this week  oh yeah  once I get it  I'll watch it  Karen Duffy  she was hot  back in the day  Karen Duffy was the hottest  chick there was  in that  yeah  for those  she had maybe  3 years  yeah  and when she was doing  House of Style  and all those  the Revlon ads  she did House of Style  after Cindy Crawford  I think so  yeah  I mean  my balls were around  the same place  that Preston's balls were 
[03:24:30]  and I was still like  okay  I'm into that chick  I'll flex her  and she wasn't even black  so I mean  that was a big deal  for me  she was like  the hot girl  with the short hair  for the first time  like wow  she has short hair  but she's so hot  and she had a little  edge to her  yeah  and she didn't mind  fucking a kid  and that was  something I learned  from a blank check  and she didn't care  where the actual guy  with all the money was  no no  he has the money  I'll just hang out with him  who cares if he's 11  yeah he's 11  I'm falling for him  I need money  these are my sunglasses  these are your sunglasses 
[03:25:00]  anybody seen Jim's sunglasses  stand there  no I don't see him over here  they're not in the bathroom  okay  Ryan in North Carolina  hello Sam  this is your new friend  in camp counselor  I wanted to let you know  that I got a picture  with you a while back  and you had broken my camera  heavyweights  that was Lars  I am Lars  we are going to be  on the body system  so I have to buy  this one too  have you never seen 
[03:25:30]  heavyweights  no I never saw heavyweights  like heavyweights  isn't even on  this sort of  oh this is a fun  kids movie  and it's like  you watch blank check  because it takes you  back to when you were  a kid and it's fun  and everything  heavyweights is  just a good movie  are they related at all  the short fat kid  and the big guy  because they look  a lot alike in the movie  if you ever watch it  which short fat kid  and the big guy  the main short fat kid  oh like the star  and then  oh and the fat counselor  the big cam counselor  they do look alike  what's up  you said heavyweights  have you 
[03:26:00]  get on the scale  get on the scale  I'm feeling skinny Tony  heavyweights is so good  like I'm sorry  if you guys haven't seen it  but you should  that's a little after  Opie and Anthony  live homework  to do  like this week  like immediately  and I've never steered you  wrong before  if you haven't seen  heavyweights  remember weeks ago  I was in here  telling everybody  you gotta see this show  that nobody's heard of  Orange is the New Black  it's become a phenomenon  I watched it  three days  I said it before 
[03:26:30]  Entertainment Weekly  you saw the whole season  in three days  well  yeah they filmed it  in New York too  Orange is the New Black  yeah they filmed it  in I think Silver Cup  oh oh oh  I was about to say  there's not a whole lot  of outdoor scenes  in this show  it's a prison show  mostly when they show him  right  what's that Frankie Muniz movie  with Paul Giamatti  I don't know  that came out  way after we were kids  though  like Frankie Muniz  is considerably younger  than us  that's not like  his Bond movie  no when he was a kid  before  yeah  that was before  Agent Cody Banks  Agent Cody Banks 
[03:27:00]  yeah we were like  we were like 17  when that movie came out  oh  you were way too old  to appreciate that movie  we were too old  to watch Blank Check  yeah exactly  like we were  94  I was 11 in 94  I was 16  okay you were way too  fucking old  yeah that's why  I didn't see it  but that means  and Cody Banks  must have come out  40  so  that's way after  Roland you were like  20 when Cody Banks  Agent Cody Banks  came out  I saw Frankie Muniz 
[03:27:30]  okay  you want to see  what year  sorry to cut you off  okay wait wait  what year were you born  Roland  79  1979  okay so you're 34  yeah  yeah okay  Cody Banks came out  in 2003  with Hilary Duff  that's like  you were 24  you were an adult  you were out  you were  you were  you were  you were  you were  you were in  grad school  by then  if you were  still in school  why would you  reference  take a call 
[03:28:00]  that was  literally  10 years  after any movie  we're talking about  Agent Cody Banks  my bad  my bad  oh what a creep  you are  you're a creep  you're like hey  ever seen Spy Kids 3  that one's really good  it came out  two years ago  yeah Frankie Muniz  is like  you know  that you're not  age appropriate  for that movie  because Frankie Muniz  is 15 years  younger than you  what about Toys  the classic movie 
[03:28:30]  Toys with uh  Toy Story  or Toys  no Toys  which are prior  or is that  no that's  The Toy  that was in  yeah The Toy  The Toy  that was in the 80s  yeah that  that I can give you  alright  uh Dr. X  in Mexico  oh como estas  hey how you guys doing  what's up buddy  you remember  the movie  Emmanuel  with Sylvia Crystal  she comes out  as a private tutor  for this little rich kid  whose dad goes away  in a movie called  Private Lessons  now she's got  in her 30s  or whatever  she's in cahoots  with the butler  trying to get the kid  to fall in love 
[03:29:00]  and swindle him out  of I don't know  this cash  but oh my god  it is the fucking  hottest movie  this little kid  is swabbing her  down in the tub  what  at the end  he takes  yeah  it's the fucking  grossest thing  it's from 81  now can you  that's the hottest movie  when you're a kid  because you're like  in your head  you're thinking  I could probably get  some real chicks here  and I could soap her  down in the tub  I still see the fucking  movie and I blow a nut  yeah but here's the  problem  that's what I was  going to ask you  you still bust a nut  to that 
[03:29:30]  here's the problem  with that  because it's not  like Blank Check  and some of these  other movies  that was a  one from the early 80s  but two it had  an R rating  right like Blank Check  so they were blatantly  making it that way  Blank Check wasn't  supposed to come off  it's got a G rating  Blank Check  like that's a kid's movie  it's like Winnie the Pooh  yeah  like real G  except  in Winnie the Pooh  there was no  references to pedophilia  well have you watched  Winnie the Pooh lately  maybe there is  you just don't know 
[03:30:00]  I haven't  and I had to go back  and watch Blank Check  again to get that  sort of sexual attention  so maybe you're right  about Winnie the Pooh  have you seen  Heavyweights rolling  I remember it  you have to  like I watch Heavyweights  at least once  every couple months  have you seen  Cody Banks  no I'm way too old  to have seen that movie  Eric did you see  Cody Banks  no I've never seen it  no why would you  I don't even know  what that means  do you want to see  some of the movies  around that time 
[03:30:30]  that Cody Banks came out  no that Blank Check  I guess  and this is what it  recommends after I was  purchasing Blank Check  here  you did purchase it though  yes  did you purchase Heavyweights  yeah it's in the card  I gotta finish that  but I didn't want to  lose this list here  so here's what else  it's suggesting  for movies around that time  Cool Runnings  great movie  we got a bobsled team  kiss the egg  is that John Candy's  last one  I think that was  John Candy's last movie  no John Candy's was  no yeah  I think it's Cool Runnings  alright so there was that 
[03:31:00]  the Sandlot  Sandlot's great  the Big Green  I love the Big Green  that's like when they  tried to  that's like  they took the Sandlot  and they were like  this was an outrageously  successful movie  what if we do the same thing  except with soccer  oh gosh  and so they took  they took the big fat  you know  great hambino  redheaded kid  and they just put him  as the goalie  on a soccer team  seriously  and I mean the movie  didn't pan out to be  quite as successful  as the Sandlot  obviously  but I'll fuck with  the Big Green  any day  I wouldn't  tell that  Benny the Jet  you need Benny the Jet 
[03:31:30]  Rodriguez don't you  he was my favorite  I bet he was  big crush on him  there's also  Camp Nowhere  with Christopher Lloyd  that was a great movie  but it wasn't Heavyweight  so I was like  I have room in my life  at that point  when I was a child  for one camp movie  it was Heavyweight  it was Heavyweight  always  Richie Rich  that was a shitty  no that was a shitty movie  that was Macaulay Culkin's  worst film  that was when you realized  it's all over  for Macaulay Culkin  that movie  yeah Richie Rich  was when you realized  okay it was just  Home Alone then 
[03:32:00]  like okay  he just had Home Alone  then he did  Getting Even with Dad  and it was even worse  The First Kid  was that with Sinbad  Sinbad  can't fuck with Sinbad  there's that  there is Man of the House  with Chevy Chase  and Jonathan Taylor Thomas  that was great  that was just a great film  and I think  who was it  Farrah Fawcett  I think so  maybe  Rookie of the Year  Angels in the Outfield  yeah Joey Gordon-Levitt  I love Rookie of the Year 
[03:32:30]  and Rookie of the Year's great  Tom and Huck  I'm not  I would never watch  Tom and Huck  even at a young age  oh three ninjas too  how come they don't  make movies  as good for kids anymore  remember like  Adventure of the Babysitting  that was a great movie  yeah I had a crush on there  wasn't that  that was  what's his name's  first movie  the director  Chris Columbus  yeah  not Christopher  he's the guy  who discovered America  that was even more impressive  Jerry on Staten Island  hey Sam  how you doing  I'm a big fan of the show 
[03:33:00]  thanks buddy  cool  I don't know  if you ever saw  the movie  Dutch  I did see Dutch  Dutch  Dutch is the best  I love Dutch  yeah with Ed O'Neill  that was very interesting  because he had to bring home  the kid for the holidays  from prep school  and the kid was all  stuck up or whatever  and there was a scene  like you were saying  with the uncomfortableness  between the kid  and the older lady  where they pick up  the two prostitutes  off the side of the road  right  and the one prostitute  like farting with him  the whole time 
[03:33:30]  right  and it turns out  that when they go  in the hotel  or the restaurant  they end up getting  ripped off  and robbed  or whatever  and there was just  that cool scene  where Ed O'Neill  had to break it to him  that she was a hooker  and he felt like weird  see but at least  in those movies  you know  it's a hooker  and it's like  this is sexual  and this is  this is kind of bad  but it's good  it's something  they're doing  to develop  in Blank Check  it was just the story  of a grown adult woman  falling in love 
[03:34:00]  with a child  what about Big  when he went back  to a kid  and they waved  after he knew  that they banged each other  I watched that movie  yesterday  for the first time  no  oh okay good  yeah I mean  Big was weirdness  because the woman in Big  accidentally fucked a kid  it was by mistake  she didn't know  she like to me  to me Tom Hanks  looked like an adult  and she felt the same way  unfortunately it turned out  he was just 13 year old  Josh Baskins  that was the thing  that he did  she made me cocoa pop  but 
[03:34:30]  that is pretty  still  that's forgivable  Ed O'Neill buying  Dutch prostitutes  that's forgivable  Karen Duffy  falling in love  you're just not  going to let this go  she fell in love  with a child  she fell in love  with his money  definitely  was that it?  well it was his money  I think it was  the way he filled out  that suit  and then it was  real love  wasn't Preston  like saying that  he was looking for  a real love  that the guy  with all the money  was actually in love  with her  Mr. McIntosh  yeah he was like  trying to hook him up  or something 
[03:35:00]  but she fell for him  and that is  weird  it's not  there's nothing  right about it  Steve in Ohio  hey how's it going  good  John Cady's last movie  was Blazing Saddles  he died while filming it  okay that's the most  retarded phone call  I've ever heard  Blazing Saddles  Blazing Saddles  Blazing Saddles  maybe that was  the one John Candy  was in  number one  he wasn't in it  number two  it came out  in 1970 whatever 
[03:35:30]  Wheeze made me  watch that movie  that's a great movie  it was one of the  greatest ones  he made me watch it  but John Candy  there's not even  anybody who looks  like John Candy  in that movie  no  not at all  that wasn't even  Gene Wilder's last movie  Steve from Ohio  is tired  line four is right  though  line one  two three four  Dom in Texas  I mean Dom  to your credit  for once  the last guy  actually was  retarded  yeah I know 
[03:36:00]  you know  you can't win them all  right  no it was  Wagons East  and he actually  died while  filming the movies  and had to  CGI him in  on some of the  things  like Olivia Soprano  or Olivia  whatever  yeah sure  okay  thank you Dom  like season three  season three  of The Sopranos  Tony's mom  was all like  CGI weirdness  is that The Crow  when they can't  finish it filming  right  but in The Crow  did they use CGI  or did they just  get some other  schlub and paint  his face  I think they  tried a little  bit of both  how awkward  does that look 
[03:36:30]  what the CGI  yeah that's  pretty bad  on The Sopranos  when it first  happened  it was like  wow this is  amazing  but then  when you look  back on it  now  as much as  CGI has  improved  it looks  terrible  like it looks  like it just  her head  was  Tony's mom's  head  was cut out  of some other  scene  and just  pasted on  like  I don't know  what you're  talking about  Rich in Florida  hey what about  Milk Money  where those  little elementary  school kids 
[03:37:00]  buy a prostitute  yeah  Melanie Griffith  yeah  Milk Money  is  they never  because there's  no way  that a movie  like Milk  Money could be  made now  there's no way  they would let  okay here's the  plot of the film  these kids get  together  and they save  up all their  change in a jar  and then they  buy a hooker  with it  because they  want their dad  to be happy  like that's a  touching story  but it involves  a little bit  of prostitution  but they got  big actors  Harris and  Melanie Griffith  Malcolm McDowell  is in that  yeah  and Melanie 
[03:37:30]  Griffith is a  prostitute  right  yeah  but they'll  never do  anything like  that  they also  won't make  movies where  grown women  fall in love  with children  and that  might be a  good thing  like  Bill Burks  can't make  his movies  now today  no  I'll come  back  what  where they  make movies  where grown  women are  you just  we want it  to come  back  well everything's  cyclical  you know  it comes back  every 20 years  so we're due  for a resurgence  of mid 90s  that's just a  hope of yours  no it'll  happen  it's like the  JT song  that mother  fucking loving 
[03:38:00]  or that  mother fucking  loving  the mother  loving  song  this song is  called mother  lover  not mother  fucking loving  did you ever  say that  Iraq  I did  trucker bob  in texas  mother fucking  loving  weird science  with Kelly  LeBrock  oh my god  when Kelly  LeBrock  comes out  of that  computer  in that  little half  shirt  and panties  I go  like my  underdeveloped 
[03:38:30]  brain was not  prepared for that  I had a  meltdown  a literal  meltdown  even the poster  was hot  yeah  even the poster  was hot  you could jerk  off to the  poster of weird  science  it was a more  innocent time  because we  were young  and there  wasn't free  porn on the  internet  wait how old  were you when  that movie  came out  I don't know  but it doesn't  mean I couldn't  watch it  on a whole video  I was two  just jerking my  tiny little dick  to it  it was amazing  I was like this  is incredible  you knew back  then  yeah  I was like holy  Toledo 
[03:39:00]  I gotta jerk  this thing  it was so small  then too  it was adorable  but yeah  it was a time  when it was like  you could do that  because there  wasn't free  porn on the  internet  so would you  guys do a  steal dirty  magazines  shove them  up your legs  you'd watch the  scramble channels  right you'd watch  scramble channels  and you'd jerk off  I'm telling you  Jackie  don't tell  human resources  I told you this  but you would  jerk off to the  sounds and  kind of like  you'd kind of  make out a  titty  like use your  imagination  well you could  kind of like  the lines on the 
[03:39:30]  TV would move  for a second  and you could  see a nipple  and you didn't  even know always  if it was a  guy's nipple  or a girl's nipple  or if it was a  nipple  yeah it could  have been a toe  and when it  sort of would  focus they're all  blue  right yeah  for a second  but you'd hear  all the sounds  and that would  be enough then  oh I'm sure  that's what  skidamax came in  right  like the other  but it's not  like that anymore  the other night  I was looking  on TV for  something to  jerk off to  and literally  flipping channels  they just say  you don't  you don't pay  for this channel 
[03:40:00]  right no no  I was flipping  around channels  like oh maybe  I'll see something  on HBO  or maybe there'll  be something  and then I said  oh and I  looked down  and my phone  was right next  to me  so I just  oh just google  a video on  your phone  and you have  just pornography  at your fingertips  I just go to  QVC  what  a plethora of  women that pop  out there  oh my god  you jerk off  to QVC  yeah  still  yeah  but you got a  phone  you just look at  the phone  it's charging  because it gets  too hot  I'm like  I gotta let the  phone rest  oh my god  and then your  palms all nice  and warm  yeah then you're  like hi

[03:43:30]  no I that one  slipped right by me  it's in the  Magna Carta  what's the what  yeah I don't even  know what that  means  no you're just  trying to you're  trying to dig your  way out anyways you  can  yes  hot dog was one  of those uh  cliche ski movies  where they're at the  resort and then they  do got to do a  competition to win the  girl oh yeah  mountain you ever  seen the movie  Midnight Madness  hmm I might have  you know who  you know who  debuted in that  movie young man  named Michael J  Fox no that's 
[03:44:00]  something you want  to put on your  little Amazon  car  bright lights big  city huh  bright lights big  city what's that  Michael J Fox  movie oh yeah  he's a lawyer that  one's good  Doc Hollywood  Doc Hollywood's  great it's not as  good as Midnight  Madness I'm still  confused by that one  movie's called Hot  Dog I'm still  hot dogging it  down the mountain  I'm still confused  why Disney thought  it was a good idea  to let a grown ass  woman fall in love  with a child that's  what I'm still  confused about  that was Disney's  dream you didn't  see you know Simba  getting all involved  with pedophilic lines 
[03:44:30]  you know you didn't  see the beast fall in  love with a nine  year old beauty no  but when you get to  live action Disney  finds it appropriate  for grown women to  I don't know the  rewatch of Blank  Check blew my mind  I gotta rewatch all  these old movies  and find more  Heavyweights is by  far the best one  well there's nothing  hidden in there  that's just a plain  awesome movie  that's just a good  well made film  do you remember  Flight of the  Navigator  and of course I  remember Flight of  the Navigator 
[03:45:00]  of course I remember  and if you go on  the Disney MGM  backlot tour the  spaceship from Flight of  the Navigator is on  it yeah  that big silver  clam looking thing  yeah the orb  what was I gonna say  oh yeah I'll say  this and this might get  a little controversial  Heavyweights  is Ben Stiller's  best movie  I said it  did you know in  that movie  Ben Stiller's  workout logo  is also his  workout logo  in Dodgeball  well he's the same 
[03:45:30]  character in Dodgeball  yeah  but nobody remembered  Heavyweights  no but I watched it  and I saw the same  exact thing  that's so funny  that is his best role  yeah  he's hysterical  Tony Perkins is better  than LaFleur any day  is LaFleur  Vince Vaughn's character  I don't know  I can't remember  I'm off the map  with Dodgeball  but Heavyweights  are you feeling skinny  Sal  I'm feeling skinny  Heavyweights  I'm feeling skinny  Tony  no I forget  I can't remember  I think it's in Dodgeball  and he's like  my friends  Blazer  Laser  he really plays 
[03:46:00]  the exact same  fucking character  in both movies  yeah he really does  Jeff  in Michigan  yo  um  movie from that era  Ladybugs  with  Rodney Dangerfield  yeah  great movie  unforgettable  Snowy in Michigan  guys how you doing  good  uh  couple good movies  with John  John Cusack  uh  Better Off Dead  and One Crazy Summer  both those  One Crazy Summer  was great  hilarious  yeah 
[03:46:30]  also uh  the phone screener  uh  I guess he's confused  with Seth McFarlane  or whatever his name is  cause he wrote  Better Off Ted  uh  our phone screener  wrote Better Off Ted  I love that movie too  who Better Off Ted  yeah Better Off Ted  yeah  Better Off Ted  it's a French uh  immigrated uh  fucking bear  are you a John Cusack  fan Roland  love him  he's great isn't he  every movie  I think he's like  the uh  like the  darker  prom-com guy  the rewatchability  of High Fidelity 
[03:47:00]  is almost uncontested  I love Gross Point Blank  in those movies  yeah  yeah  yeah  I'm with you  Dusty in Texas  Dusty  Dusty  hello  Dusty's not there  he missed his opportunity  well  we'll go to Steve  Steve what's up buddy  yeah I just wanted to  recommend if she hasn't  seen him  One Crazy Summer  and Better Off Dead  those are the two  all right  well I'm glad  everybody's listening  um  yeah that's one  when somebody 
[03:47:30]  coincidentally  has the exact same  suggestions  questions as a caller  two minutes to go  maybe we hang up  you know  that's why  there's a phone screener  it's pretty funny  the first one  yeah  not the second one  no the second one's  terrible  but  what do you got there  Sal  this is the line  the YouTube thing  is titled  greatest movie line  of all time  this is  I'm with you Sal  this is a great line  from heavyweights  play that  turn on the camera  Josh Birnbaum  step on up  get on the scale  son  get off 
[03:48:00]  turn off the camera  yeah Kenan's in it  it's a fat camp  movie  it's a fat camp  movie where all the  kids are cheating  but uh  and they've been at  this fat camp  for like six years  so your laughter  when I watch it  I might cry  I don't know  no but Ben Stiller  play  you'll love it  because Ben Stiller  plays this character  who was homeschooled  all his life  so he cannot relate  to children  whatsoever  so he's Tony Perkis 
[03:48:30]  and he comes in  and he takes over  the fat camp  and he wants to  create an infomercial  and he's working  all these fat kids  too hard  but guess what  spoiler alert Roland  you know why  you're going to  love this movie  fat kids win  in the end  that's right  fat kids win  60% of America  that's right  you're just going  with the numbers  right  that's all I care about  Eric must have  loved the scene  in heavyweights  where they're all  like uh  where they tie up  Tony Perkis  for the first time  and they're having a food party  yeah and they take over  the whole field  and they're shooting  whipped cream at each other  and eating pizzas 
[03:49:00]  and chicken bones  they all wake up  looking like they were drinking  but they've got food  all over  food comas  yeah  you remember that scene Eric  no I haven't seen it  so I just ordered  a few movies  you did  yes  I hope Amazon's  giving me some money  off that  listen  Eric bought himself  a couple gifts  but you gotta know  what the best gift  to give the woman  in your life is  don't you  Jackie you know  yes we're very picky  yes  women are tough  the best gift  for any occasion though  or no occasion at all  is an I love you gift  Jackie how much do you love  I love you gifts  I love them
