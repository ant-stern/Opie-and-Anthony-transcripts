<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show, airing on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, opened with a discussion about the holiday itself, its perceived significance, and Lincoln's role in freeing the slaves. This devolved into a racially charged rant about Hitler's motivations, interspersed with numerous racial slurs and offensive language. The hosts recounted a story about a weatherman fired for a racist on-air blunder.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal was present throughout much of the show.  The conversation then shifted to a comparison of historical figure portrayals, contrasting Lincoln's actions with those attributed to Hitler.  The discussion then moved to video games, focusing on the realistic graphics and emotional responses evoked by titles like *Call of Duty*, *Resident Evil*, and *Condemned*, along with anecdotes about frightening gaming experiences and the absence of cheat codes in modern games.

The show continued with a further discussion of video games, specifically *Resident Evil*, and then segued into a lengthy, humorous debate about NFL dynasties, featuring listener calls and arguments over the criteria for defining a dynasty, referencing teams like the Patriots, Steelers, Cowboys, and Bills.  A Martin Luther King Day segment ironically played a clip of Jimmy the Greek making highly offensive comments about black athletes, followed by discussion of recent NFL playoff games, referee calls, and the perceived overrepresentation of Samoans in the NFL, including a listener call.

An audio clip from an online *Counter-Strike* game showcased a frustrating teammate obstructing others.  This transitioned into a discussion of a video from HotGhettoMess.com, "Where's My Change?", featuring a young black child’s profane tirade at a Korean store owner, later identified by a caller as a scene from *Living the Life*.

Patrice O'Neal recounted a bizarre McDonald's encounter involving a man repeatedly stating "It's cold out here" while seemingly trying to access his car.  This led to speculation and listener calls.  A brief call with Sean Hannity concluded this segment.

The hosts then discussed their Las Vegas gambling experiences, followed by a tribute to radio personality Bob Grant, touching upon his controversial career, firing from WABC, and comments about Ron Brown.  The conversation moved to Danny Bonaduce’s struggles and the challenges faced by former child stars.

Sean Hannity joined the show again, discussing his TV viewing habits (including watching "bitches in prison" on MSNBC), an upcoming A&E Lincoln show, and his political views.  The hosts and Hannity debated Lincoln's motivations in freeing the slaves, including strategic, moral, and economic considerations,  using highly offensive language throughout.  Patrice O'Neal and Bill Burr joined the studio conversation, adding to the already vulgar and offensive commentary on Lincoln and slavery.  Tangents included discussions on airplane sickness, home remedies, and Bill Burr's stand-up comedy.

A significant portion focused on the documentary "Grizzly Man," its subject Timothy Treadwell, his apparent homosexuality, and his death.  The hosts and guests shared opinions, reactions, and humorous observations.  A listener call and further "Grizzly Man" discussion, along with comments on Bill Burr's show, concluded this segment, marked by more vulgar language and off-color jokes.

The show began with Opie singing a nonsensical song.  The hosts engaged in a racially charged discussion about the status of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a "real" holiday.  Patrice O'Neal discussed his VH1 show, "Web Junk 20," showcasing and commenting on various internet videos, including a dog bite incident and Tyra Banks on "America's Next Top Model," using highly offensive language.  The hosts recounted their experience at the Donald Trump roast, their obstructed view, and subsequent observations of Cheryl Tiegs, leading to offensive and ageist remarks about older women.  Finally, they discussed "Flavor of Love," using highly offensive and misogynistic language. A brief, technically-challenged call about "Brokeback Mountain" resulted in homophobic slurs from the hosts before the show concluded with jokes and vulgar language.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes.  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:04:30]  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  It's a new club at a radio.  Ho, ho, opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I am Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  Opie is a great, beautiful, beautiful. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The next couple of days, temperature is going to stay well above normal  after a couple of days well below normal.  Here's a look at your extended forecast for tomorrow.  Sunshine, 60 degrees, Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 
[00:05:30]  With these temperatures in the low 60s and mostly sunny skies.  Look at that as we head forward Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  Whoopsie.  You're fired.  Goodbye.  Ouch.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  That was a year ago, obviously,  that we played that clip for the first time.  Wow.  That went quickly.  Yeah, that guy fucked up.  Are they doing two of those a year now, Martin Luther King? 
[00:06:00]  Is that important?  Because that seems like half a year ago.  All right.  Guy fucked up and he was out the door pretty much that afternoon.  Do you have a new job or is that it for him?  Jimmy the Greek and his ass right to the grave.  I have no idea what happened to that guy.  No cool.  Poor guy.  How do you go for that next job?  What was your last job?  Your last employer?  I was at W Blah Blah Blah News.  I was the weatherman over there. 
[00:06:30]  Okay.  A reason for leaving that job?  A little problem on air.  What was that?  I said Martin Luther Coon on Martin Luther King Jr.  All right.  Well, we'll call you.  And they never, why don't these motherfuckers ever fuck up wifey with me?  See, this is why I'm here today.  Just because, just to make white people, make sure wifey will behave themselves on Martin Luther King's birthday.  We have to behave ourselves.  No one ever says, hey, today's George Washington faggot's birthday today.  Why are they always fraudy and slipping with niggas? 
[00:07:00]  I don't understand it.  They give them crap about the wooden teeth, I think, is that thing.  And, well, President's Day, right?  Isn't that today?  Is that coming up soon or something?  I don't know.  Like they want to lump it all into one thing.  But Lincoln's getting a little abuse on the History Channel.  I got to watch this.  Did you see that?  What is the coalition between Lincoln and him getting a bad rap?  He helped niggas out.  Now they got to expose him for the nutcase.  He was a schizophrenic.  He was a fucking nut. 
[00:07:30]  They're like, he was waging two wars, one on the battlefield, one in his head.  I know one in his head was helping those niggas be freed.  On the morning.  What a mistake.  On that dreadful morning in 1964, he woke up and said, I freed the what?  Lord, I'm glad he was crazy.  We'd still be picking cotton if that white man wasn't crazy. 
[00:08:00]  Of course he was crazy.  Look what he did.  Look what he did.  He freed the slaves.  He freed the slaves right at the peak of the slaves, right when we needed them the most.  You see why we don't like white people?  Do you see?  Let Lincoln be.  How long has he been dead?  How can you talk about how George Washington used to fuck rabbits or something?  Give us that first.  He never did anything bad.  You know what you should do to make it not fucked up?  Just all the presidents.  How many was it? 
[00:08:30]  60 or some shit?  I don't know.  There's been a few.  A bit of 40-something.  40-something.  Yeah, 45-something.  Just do like a succession of specials of how fucked up they all were.  Every single one of them.  And just get in the 16th week is Lincoln.  You know what I mean?  Just talk about Quincy Adams, but don't just say Lincoln was a crazy motherfucker.  He freed the slaves.  Do something else.  Somebody else.  Just one second.  Do you know that absolutely was not a noble thing that he did?  Like, it wasn't out of nobility. 
[00:09:00]  I've seen so much on this and read so much.  It was absolutely the fact that it crippled the South.  It crippled the South during a war against the South.  And Lincoln decided that was a good war strategy.  If there was no fucking war, do you think this asshole would come out and say,  She's just in the bullshit.  Free the slaves.  Can you do me?  Look it.  If you looked at it like that, it's like when you study Hitler, not to have my life destroyed.  I have done a little dabbling in the study of Hitler. 
[00:09:30]  It's like you could say in his mind.  Right.  It was a business decision.  It wasn't personal.  It was like the Holocaust was so that his soldiers wouldn't go crazy just shooting people in the streets.  It was a helping them out kind of thing.  In the beginning, it was all about getting Germany back in every facet, in business, militarily building back,  building up their spirit after being, you know, defeated in World War I and having to give up everything. 
[00:10:00]  This was their way.  They needed a common enemy.  They needed someone to blame.  Right.  They put that blame on the people that were successful in Germany at the time, the Jews.  Right.  They were making the money.  But you can't.  Like, imagine, okay, if we, out of context, right, like say somebody takes clips for this,  this little rant you're doing about Hitler.  Like that has never happened.  Mr. Cummier.  Oh, believe me, they got 800 other ones of me talking about Hitler.  Mr. Cummier has a little mustache now to commemorate Hitler's hard work. 
[00:10:30]  Why isn't his birthday celebrating?  He's a great man.  He's a man in history.  I'm not saying he was a good man, but he was a man that was there in history.  And he heard voices like that, nigger-loving Lincoln.  Motherfuckers are so wrong, man.  You guys are so wrong.  White people are so wrong when they do stuff like this. 
[00:11:00]  I am so right, Patrice.  Listen.  I am the only one looking through realistic eyes at the whole picture.  So what if Lincoln, what if Lincoln freed the slaves?  Because it was a great, it was a great thing to do to fuck the South.  But it's like.  It was all about defeating the South.  The South is trying to build and feed an army based on people going, all right, I'll get you that sugar.  Whatever you need, boss.  All of a sudden, there's none of them motherfuckers running around.  Now a good fighting man has to now provide for a family and worry about his fields and everything. 
[00:11:30]  There's a saying called impact versus intention, right?  Uh-huh.  The impact of it was greater than the intention.  He didn't know at the time.  His intention wasn't shit, but he actually did the biggest humanitarian move in the history of the world.  With ulterior motives.  Other than Moses.  The nobility of it was buried ten layers down under his ulterior motives. 
[00:12:00]  That's like if you come and you go, you know, sweetie, you know, you came by pulling my left ball.  And I really, the intention was me not to come.  But it's like he, he, we came.  It was a noble, it was a noble.  Who cares if it was noble?  The end result was noble.  You just said, well, let me get this correct because we don't want to get nobody in no goofy troubles.  That you could explain, and I was in England, I only learned about World War II correctly when I go to England. 
[00:12:30]  That's the only time I ever learned about World War II.  For all that.  Meaning, because it's a non-American viewpoint, you know what I mean?  So Hitler, if you, let somebody tell you, his mind, it was a noble.  The reason that they had the Holocaust itself is because in the beginning he used to just have his soldiers shoot people in the streets.  And they would come back crazy, like, I can't do this.  So they said, we need a better way to help our soldiers. 
[00:13:00]  More efficient way.  And here's the fucking Holocaust.  Right.  So it's like, you, you can make a case that he was a decent motherfucker.  Well, that's a little hard.  That is a rough one.  Because it's Hitler.  Right.  Don't make a case that Lincoln was a, was cuckoo, because he, he, he freed the slaves.  Can you not do that?  I'm not saying that.  I've never said that.  I said that he, he might have been cuckoo, but the cuckoo part of it was a brilliant wartime strategy. 
[00:13:30]  Free the people that are working for nothing for the enemy.  It is brilliant.  You take their workforce away.  I'm not going to say slavery wouldn't have been over if the cotton gin didn't, I mean, the cotton gin effectively would end the slavery at some point, I think.  That racist machine.  That racist, that stupid motherfucker.  That stupid machine.  Oh, and of course they got to put the word gin in the motherfucker.  Oh, no, how you like the gin and juice? 
[00:14:00]  The cotton crack.  What?  Well, happy Martin Luther King Day.  Thank you, bro.  Regardless of how the goddamn thing is.  I'm just here to make sure white people just don't.  Keep us in check.  Yeah, just don't abuse the man.  You know something, Patrice?  I appreciate it, because sometimes you're right.  I do get out there a little bit, and I need to be reeled back.  Just, oh, that crazy Lincoln. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, that man was crazy.  Even though, I ain't going to lie to you, I will expose something about the black community.  We are not jerking off Lincoln.  We really don't.  No.  Because black people really are into context, and the fact is that it wasn't like, oh, we  should free these people.  Black people know that.  Yeah.  It is Lincoln, but we're not on that shit, where it's like, he's our savior.  He's our Moses and shit.  We're not on that.  So, I mean, I'm fucking around, but, you know.  They had to do a little defending of Martin Luther King yesterday. 
[00:15:00]  I saw that going out on CNN.  Like, plagiarism or something like that.  Every, yeah, every...  Cheating on his wife a little bit.  Yeah, every year, it seems, another book comes out that points out his humanity.  You know?  Well, Jesus was supposed to be, you know, messing with hoes.  You know what it was?  He's too recent, Martin Luther King.  There's too much easily accessible info.  Jesus, you know, you can't go into the FBI fucking CIA files and go, who was this Christ?  Give me Christ's file. 
[00:15:30]  Let's see what that fucker was up to.  He was fucking healing leopards.  What's the FBI guy, the notorious motherfucker, the FBI?  Oh, Hoover?  Jay Hoover.  Jay Hoover.  You probably had the Jesus files.  Give me the Jesus file.  I want to take a look at this curing the lepers and turning that fucking water into wine shit.  I don't believe it.  But MLK, there's a shitload of stuff on him.  They were really looking at him.  Oh, they really were.  And there's accusations of a lot of womanizing, white womanizing, corruption, infighting with Jesse Jackson and other black leaders. 
[00:16:00]  So it's, I think it just shows him as more of a human than I think a lot of people like to put him up in this saintly.  Well, this is all to make sure he doesn't get, like, Jesus status.  Doesn't get Jesus status.  We got to chip away now, you know, so we don't walk around with chains with, like, of him on a balcony laying down.  On the ground and shit, like, you know, what's up, dog? 
[00:16:30]  Like, Christ on the dark.  Yeah, a diamond.  What would be on that?  A diamond Martin Luther King balcony.  A balcony.  That's just to make shit fucking chain.  To make out what it is.  No, I need an iced-out balcony, nigga, just to, you know.  You can walk around with the littlest, tiniest cross, and everyone will know you're fucking Christian or Catholic or something.  But you need a big thing for the detail of that balcony, them cradling, everyone pointing.  People pointing.  People pointing.  James Earl Ray in the bushes. 
[00:17:00]  This is a big mess.  This is the iced-out Martin Luther King Mertesine, yo.  You got a big fucking stage set on your chest.  Iced-out Mertesine.  That's just to make sure no one gets Jesus status anymore.  Yeah.  That's what that is.  No one.  Yeah.  He's the closest, I think.  Other than, unbelievably, you know, there's this dude Martin Luther without the king.  Right.  That I never even knew exists until 2000, when they did the top 200 people of the millennium or the last 2000 years. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And they go, number three, Martin Luther.  I'm like, wow, that's cool.  But where's the king?  They just left the king on.  Fuck it.  There's some white guy.  I've never heard of Martin Luther until that, until 2000.  Wasn't he like the Protestant guy?  He was, he invented, yeah, yeah, kind of, you know, whatever.  But it's like, he's, I think he's the closest since then to get that kind of status.  But Martin Luther King, they're going to make sure that he's not going to get, like, Jesus status in the next thousand years.  They got to keep undermining him a little bit. 
[00:18:00]  They got to.  Because a thousand years from now, it's like, oh, wow, he really is, black people's plight is really like the Jews in Moses' time, during the slavery.  They don't want us to change that into that.  You ain't totin' no fuckin' block up to the top of a pyramid.  Who gives a shit?  We talk, they built the pyramids for half a week.  It was half a week.  Now you talk about some fuckin', we didn't tote no fuckin' slavery.  You talk about some fuckin' slavery, my friend. 
[00:18:30]  That was slavery.  Let me tell you, let me, according to, according to Charlton Hester's movie from what I watched.  Right.  Was that Ben-Hur or the Moses one?  It was the Moses one.  All right.  Now.  Ten Commandments.  Edward G. Robinson.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Stop, Joe.  Meh.  See?  Mother Joe.  That's curtains for you, Joe.  It's curtains, see?  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh. 
[00:19:00]  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  And we can then stop the grass.  Uh-huh.  And water.  And mud.  the grass.  Meh.  Meh.  Yo-Brenner.  Yo-Brenner was a tough motherfucker.  Yo-Brenner just made sure that Edward G. Robinson was doin' shit right.  And then they just pushed  They pulled bricks  They pulled bricks  That wasn't all they did  According to that movie, to me 
[00:19:30]  That wasn't as bad as  Tote that bars, lift that bell  Picking cotton all day in the sun  It went on so much longer  Maybe the Egyptian sun was a little hotter  Than South Carolina sun  But that's about it  And there  I could fly you to find a house nigger  Back in those days either  Yeah, no, you did  There were, like, eunuchs or something  There was, no, there were  No, they were house  What, Egyptians, my friends? 
[00:20:00]  My friend?  My friend, my friend, you come in  Please, my friend  Cook the pita bread, my friend  That's where the origin of my friend came from  It was back in Egypt  My friend, no, no, no, please, my friend  Don't, don't  And I just think that, look  That's a good question  Who had the hardest slavery  Who had the hardest slavery  I would say  I don't know how long slavery went on for the pharaohs  It couldn't have took 400 years to build those pyramids  I think they were enslaved for upwards of probably 1,000 years 
[00:20:30]  I think it was a long-ass slavery that went on there  To build those fucking pyramids  At least they had one job to do  Just build ornamentary  When you get this done, we'll let you go  We'll let you go  We need some pyramids  We need a sphinx  We need a fucking tribute to Ra over here  I need the sun god motherfucker built over here  As soon as you guys complete, you go home 
[00:21:00]  Who was in charge of the nose on this motherfucking fell off?  You call that a nose?  You call that shit a nose?  It fell right off  We didn't have the straw for the bricks  Edward G. Robinson was very greedy with us  Now they'll break that straw  See?  Mwah, Mugsy, Mugsy  Gotta make sure the slaves are working  Mwah  So happy MLK to everyone out there  Yes  Whatever  In conclusion  No wayvers, Opie 
[00:21:30]  No wayvers  Whatever  This is enabling us to sit here today, Martin Luther King  It's your day  I just can't wait for the day  This show doesn't acknowledge MLK  That's why we're working today  That's why we're working  Look at us working  It's a company holiday  We're like, you know what?

[00:22:00]  And I was here to make sure you behave yourself  The truckers don't call in  And go, I was there when that  He overreacted  That nigga was taking his off  He's alive  Him and Tupac and Elvis are relaxing  Too good  MLK  Yeah, happy MLK Day  Alright, we'll say that with love  I do  We did  Alright  I appreciate that  We're going to do like black rejoiners and stuff when we come back  The guy actually during the  Probably some of the worst times 
[00:22:30]  In American history  Was able to unite black people  Something that other people have not been able to do  They've tried to come to the table  And I just can't see it happen  Marcus Garvey was close  Yeah  You know Marcus Garvey?  No  No Marcus Garvey?  I see  I have no idea  You've got to stop  You've got to stop  But if he was such a powerful uniting leader  The Whitey would know about him  Because we'd be shooting him  You know why they don't know about him?  Because he actually had the plan  That was going to save us  He created the Pan-African movement 
[00:23:00]  He bought  Was that Liberia?  No  Liberia was  That was supposed to be our fucking Israel  Because the send every African back to Africa plan  I think Whitey would have gotten behind that one  No it wasn't  It wasn't a back to Africa  It was stay in America  And trade with only Africa  We have our own ships  And trade with only Africa  When they realized  By fucking 1800  They realized black money was the shit  We wanted to spend some money  They just realized we do that 
[00:23:30]  Nigga Rich was some shit from  You know  18, 16  And we just bought shit  And they was not trying to have us go back to it  That's why Liberia failed  What do you find from Africa though?

[00:29:00]  I think the graphics was like a little cuckoo coming out of his head  Lincoln  Cuckoo  Cuckoo  You know they're probably gonna tell everybody that no one wore hats like that back then  It was just him  Imagine how ridiculous you'd look if just you walked around with that fucking stone pipe hat  There's a little known fact about Abe Lincoln  He was the only one wearing that fucking thing  He was the point of laugh  Compare him to Hitler  Notice that  Hitler the only one with that mustache  Lincoln the only one with that mustache 
[00:29:30]  Oh there you go  Lincoln  Lincoln told John Wilkes Booth  Just shoot me in the head  Because I hate this ugly bitch sitting next to me  He committed assisted suicide  God bless that Wilkes Booth  Wonderful chap  Alright  Good man  We're gonna take our first break  Alrighty  How are you Opie?  I'm just gonna be hanging today  Yeah  I'm getting there  Everyone's commenting on Pal Talk  That you have your sick hat on  Oh my god do I 
[00:30:00]  Your sick hat  I'm a lot better than last week  But I'm still  Well obviously  I'm still like 70  I don't know  I'm about 70-75%  Yeah  Almost back up to speed  You sound good  Your voice  Every fucking year I'm like  I get the flu  I was telling Patrice in the office  I get the flu every fucking year now  And every year around late September  I'm like I gotta get that flu shot  And just fucking get it over with  Didn't you get one this year?  No  Oh you didn't  I blew it off  Yeah you're the kind of guy  That just needs that flu shot  Yeah cause I get hit with this  Every fucking year now 
[00:30:30]  And last year I played through  I played  I played with it  It's best you don't take that flu shot  Man your immune system is  I played with it last year  But this year I got hit hard  And I was like fuck that  Maybe you should go to BJ's  And get that  That 75 gallon drum of blueberries  You fucking  Captain Healthy  This motherfucker  Grace just railed him this morning  A granola sandwich please  Made out of  I knew I was home  On whole wheat bread  And  I knew I was home  I'd come into the office  And instead of getting a little sympathy  For everyone 
[00:31:00]  I was like  Bam bam  Just getting the shit  Oh you just got hammered  Yeah cause people don't know  Opie comes in here  I've never seen anybody  Eat like him before  First of all  Before he comes in here  He didn't take a cab  Or drive  And have dropped off  In front of the building  What today?  Motherfucker rollerblades  Oh no no not today  No not today  But he rollerblades  To work everyday  From the upper west side  So you're moving  Which is at least 30 blocks away  You're getting some exercise  And then it's a whole day  Worth of grazing  On healthy stuff 
[00:31:30]  Which is nothing  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that  But here's the problem  I'm still rollerblading  Yeah  Not today obviously  Not anytime soon  I'm taking at least a week or two off  There was some cold fucking days  Where you come in here  With your blades in your hand  It was like under 20 degrees  And I was rollerblading still  I'm not saying  Eating healthy is bad  But I eat pork a lot  Like you know  And it's like  I'm not that well  But I don't get sick  Like  Yeah  I don't get sick like that man  But I work out hard 
[00:32:00]  And all that  So I'm always knocking down  My immune system  I'm stupid  Why is being healthy  Destroy the thing  That keeps you healthy  I don't know man  You know what  You gotta open your back  You gotta open your body up to shit  In order for it to know  How to fight the shit  You gotta get  Like expose yourself  To some  No practice  Some nastiness  He has no practice  His body has no practice  Right  In fighting  Right  You know what I mean  When you're eating fucking  Yodels  Ringdings  Some of the  And nastiness  Your body has to fight that shit 
[00:32:30]  So it's gotta build up  A little battle plan  Well Steve-O said it  Steve-O was on our show  And he said that  When he goes to these other countries  He drinks the water  To build up his immune system  Smart  Smart  You can throw up once or twice  But then after that  It's like  But it was better than staying home  Holy shit  There's nothing on fucking TV  No  If I knew I was gonna have a week off  Holy shit  I'd have gone somewhere  I'm like  Oh I'll catch up on TV  And this and that  Oh my god  There's nothing to catch up on  Thank god for celebriality  Is all I have to say  Is that it  Thank god

[00:33:30]  I watched one last night  It was pretty funny  It was a game of Counter-Strike  Some guy was  Obviously recording  Him playing Counter-Strike  But all he would do  And this thing went on  For about 10 minutes  And I watched the whole thing  Laughing my balls off  All he would do  Is go to this crucial  Junction point in the game  At the top of a ladder  And sit there  So other people on his team  Couldn't get past  And it's all voice  The guys at the headsets  And it's some kid  Whining  Move  Would you fucking move  I'm gonna get killed here  Come on 
[00:34:00]  You asshole  Fucking move  And all the guy would do  Is send out the automated  Key that you can press  That goes  Negative  Negative  And the kid's like  Move you're gonna get me  They're shooting my feet  They're shooting my  And he jumped down  Take the guy out  Climb back up the ladder  Fucking move  Negative  Negative  The guy was being  The biggest dick  And I watched all 10 minutes  Of it  It was hysterical  Just a prick in the game 
[00:34:30]  That's great  We gotta find that audio  Yeah we'll play a little bit of it  Well Patrice  You were saying  You were playing a video game  Where it's not even fun  The Xbox thing  It's not  What is it  Call of Duty 2  Call of Duty  It's not even fun  It's like real war  It's like you  It's a strategy  Like you can't just  Bum rush the dudes  No it's not a run and shoot  What is that  The AI thing  The artificial intelligence  You can't just go  Rush them  There's a guy  The only help it gives you 
[00:35:00]  Is a grenade  Implicator  That the grenade  Is implied around your area  That's the only way  That you'll continue to live  Other than that  It's like real  World War 2  Like you go  Oh my god  Like you start to get nervous  Like  Holy shit  I died  Like you always imagine  Yourself in war  Like being one of those guys  You're living  But it's like  Okay I'm crawling  And then a dude  Is right there  And he shoots you 
[00:35:30]  In the back of the head  And it gives you  And here's how creepy it is  It wiggles  It says  You died  And then it gives you  A quote for some  Fucking war guy  Yeah  War is crazy shit  Alexander the Great  You know  I never learned that quote  From that guy  You know  War is some crazy shit  It's not  It's not  Fun  Yeah  It's war  It's very realistic  As far as 
[00:36:00]  The enemy AI goes  It's not like the old days  You're right  The older games  You could run in  Run and shoot  Run and shoot  Run and shoot  Now it's about  You know  I gotta do a pincer  Maneuver  We have to outflank  This guy  And yeah  The guys are right there  They take cover now  When you shoot at them  Some Rambo shit  The old school was Rambo  This one  The only  The only two things  That's game like  Is  One  Like I said  It tells you that  A grenade is in the vicinity  A little grenade 
[00:36:30]  And it'll be an arrow  That's pointing towards  Where it is  Yeah  So if it's behind you  The arrow's pointing down  And you go  You run forward  And if you run forward  Those motherfuckers  Shoot you  As you're trying to run  From the grenade  So you can picture yourself  Going  Oh grenade  And then  Run  And then  And you die  And then it's time  For another quote  Another quote  I'm not gonna  Do this  Ever  In my life  Winston Churchill 
[00:37:00]  Right  You know  And the only thing  That's like  Game like  It gives you barriers  Right  That you can't go  Past  Yeah like a  Broken down building  A broken building  With a crack  You can't squeeze  Yeah you can't quite  Get through  Just to keep you  On that thing  But other than that  Dude it is  And then  The illest thing  About the game  Okay two or three  Of you  You know you always  Got two or three friends  Yeah  You're in an abandoned  Building  And it says  Okay hold down  This building  Until such and such  Comes  And usually 
[00:37:30]  In those old school  Games you just  Pick them all  And blah blah blah  These motherfuckers  Dude  You hear  Like  Hundreds of guys  And you see them  Running over the hillside  At you  And you're like  Oh my god  You just go  Turn it off  Like I said  You know what  This is not even  Fuck this is not even  Fun  It's  This is like  Real  It's stressing me out  Yeah  You know  But it's  It's unbelievable  It's an unbelievable  Game to exist 
[00:38:00]  Yep  But it's not  That great of fun  Man it's not  It's really not  They're getting amazing  And they're only  Going to get better  You've been through  A part of the game  Where you got to  Walk through  And it's  Old busted down  Buildings and shit  And it's nothing  But snipers  That you can't see  You're walking  You're taking cover  And everything  And all of a sudden  And you're getting hit  You're trying to take cover  You're getting hit  From the back  And you look around  You pop up  For a quick look 
[00:38:30]  Because you're getting shot  You can't see shit  There's snipers  It's everywhere  It's the spit  And then your sniper  This is the thing  It's just like  I don't want to play  A real game  Like the basketball  And all that shit  It's like  I don't need to see  This motherfucking sweat  Or his drawers  Get wet or whatever  But on the war game  The sniper mode  It's not just like  Now sniper is your favorite gun  In any game  Is the sniper gun  Ready  Not this shit  That you shake  What?  The shit goes up and down 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, yeah  So you gotta put this  You gotta push the  Stop being nervous  Button  And then you go  And then you go  All right  And if you miss  The motherfucker knows  You shot at him  And then it runs  And then it runs  I didn't know he's coming  To find it now  I love it  And he's coming  To get  They find your  Where you  Where the  They say it came from there  Yeah  Go tell the  The AI  Go say  It came from that building  Over there

[00:54:00]  I don't wanna have to go through it  Ten times  I did it  I got through that part  Why should I  If I get shot  Like fucking ten minutes later  Do I have to now run through  This part of the game again  Well that's a prerequisite now  They have  All games  You can just stop  There are some games  Though you gotta reach  A checkpoint  Before you're able to save it  Or  You get three saves  Max  Per segment  Of game  Right  Fuck that  I wanna save everything  I just jumped over  The fucking crevice  And made it  I just jumped over  A log save  Yeah  Save 
[00:54:30]  Someone  I just shot the guy  That was around this corner  Save  I want him  Coming back  And shoot me in the back  Like a save  Private fucking Ryan  Everyone dies  In my fucking games  I just jumped over  A log save  I don't care  If some Nazi  Is sitting there  Going  With his hands  Behind his head  Boom  Dead  Save  That fucker  Ain't coming back  I'm never  Ever seeing him  In the game again  And wait  They got games  Like that  It's 
[00:55:00]  Moral  Code  Like  Your morale  You can choose  Your destiny  Shoot the German  In his head  Right  Or let him go  Cause maybe  He's a good guy  And it changes you  For the rest of the game  Changes your path  The whole  Life  Yeah  I shoot him in the fucking head  All the time  You gotta  Let's go to Mike  On Long Island  Mike what's up  What's up boys  Hey I was playing  Resident Evil Outbreak  And uh  The next night  I had nightmares  I was at the level  Where you're fighting 
[00:55:30]  A leech man  So the next night  I'm sleeping in bed  At about 3 o'clock  In the morning  I just fling out of bed  Start yelling  Leeches  Leeches  I have leeches  All over my body  My wife wakes up  It looks like  I'm throwing them  Off my body  She's like  What the fuck  Is wrong with you  Then I lay back  And go back to sleep  Funny thing ever  Dude  Andy you're totally right  They make these games  They're so scary  They're so scary  Now the first game  I ever played  That was petrifying  Like that was Half-Life  It's called Half-Life  And it had a great story 
[00:56:00]  For the time  And this is like  Maybe 96  Or no  98 maybe  Half-Life  The graphics  Were fantastic  Gameplay  AI  Everything  For that time  It was the game  It made game of the year  In every friggin magazine  I love the game  Half-Life 2 came out  It's alright  Not as good as the first  But still  They're trying to build it up  To Half-Life 2  A little bit  Their AI is amazing  And they have  Ragdoll graphics  For the people you shoot  So they fall off rooftops  And just  Their arms will bend 
[00:56:30]  Behind their fucking head  Right  And the gravity gun  Is very cool  But talk about scary games  That game  You'd be walking  Through these duct works  You know  Through the duct work  And these things  Called head crabs  Come out of nowhere  And just go  And latch onto your face  And you gotta like  Beat them with crowbars  And shit  Just to get rid of them  Petrifying game  Another one was called  Deus Ex  I heard of that  That was a good game  The original  Not the second one 
[00:57:00]  That didn't get no props though  Nah  It had a lot of flaws  But it was scary  It was scary  In more of a sci-fi way  I had to get through  I physically jumped  Out of my chair  I came through this duct work  To a vent  Into a storage room  So I popped the vent out  I look to my left  There's nothing there  I look to my right  There's this big  Two-legged  RoboCop machine  That just goes  And looks at you  And starts shooting  I didn't expect it  So much 
[00:57:30]  I fell out of my chair  Fell out  I don't like being  It scared the shit out of me  I mean I would think  The granddaddy  I mean somebody could be wrong  But I would think  The granddaddy  Of fear  Was Resident Evil  Yeah  And that just  You play the Silent Hill games  You know  I couldn't get through  Silent Hill  The thing on Resident Evil  That got me  The first one  And the other one  Scared me too  The one with the  With the guy  What's the fucking monster  The creation they made  In the last movie 
[00:58:00]  And he just would be like  Umbrellas  Oh yeah  The umbrella core  The umbrella core  But I was walking  Through the god damn hallway  And my lights were off  I was chilling out  Resident Evil  And the evil dogs  Jumped through the fucking window  And my body  Wouldn't allow me  To push whatever button  I needed to push  And I didn't  I said  This is not  Why am I playing this  Like there's no way  You should be afraid  To play a fucking game  And it just was scary 
[00:58:30]  You know what I mean  And it's just  Nowadays dude  I heard this thing  Condemned  Bobby was telling me  Condemned  He's like dude  He's calling me  You know like  It's a real murder  Dude and you're walking  With a flashlight  And these crackhead  Dude things  Yeah Bobby's really  Into this shit  I'm like man  I don't need that shit man  I'm getting pissed off  At this war  I'm like  Give me  Give me  Like  Commandos  You know  Where I just run  And there's something  Glowing on the ground 
[00:59:00]  And I pick it up  It's a super duper  Head blowing up gun  You know what I'm saying  Alright baby  And you just pick it up  Come and get me  Give me the super duper  Give me this crazy gun  I'm gonna find myself  A big rock  And hang out for a while  You know  It's like  That's it  I do  Right  Not like  I gotta shoot a German  And then  There's a  You don't just go  Running over the gun  Nah  You  You gotta rifle  Through his fucking pockets  While they're shooting  So 
[00:59:30]  You gotta duck down  And the guy goes  Go check his pockets  And you're like  Okay  And you're looking  And you go  I got  I got a clip  So I can continue on  Yay  Yeah  Choose the right weapon  You go  Okay  Alright  Now okay  I picked up  So if you  If you pick  If you gotta make decisions  You go  Either I'm gonna pick up  A machine gun  Right  Or I'm gonna pick up  A bolt action rifle  Oh you can't carry  20 bazookas  Three fucking

[01:01:00]  Talking about the black athlete  All black day  Oh yeah  It's black day  The black is a better athlete  To begin with  Because he's been bred  To be that way  Because of his high thighs  And big thighs  It goes up into his back  And they can jump higher  And run faster  Because of their bigger thighs  This goes back  All the way to the Civil War  When during the slave trading  The big  The owner  The slave owner  Would breed  His big black  To his big woman  So that he could have 
[01:01:30]  A big black kid  Straight out of Compton  Crazy motherfucker  Named Ice Cube  From the gang  Called niggas  With attitudes  When I'm called off  I got a sawed off  Squeeze a trigger  And bodies are hard off  You too play  It's a fuck with me  This is his legacy  Yeah  Happy Martin Luther King Day  To everyone  We're back  With the Opie and Anthony  Program on XM Satellite Radio  How about them Colts?  How about them Colts?  Holy shit  Can you say choke? 
[01:02:00]  You watch any of the games  Over the weekend?  Nope  Didn't watch any of the games  There were some fine football games  Don't really  Didn't really care about  Any of the fucking teams  Patriots lost  But I don't think anyone  Was expecting anything  From the Patriots this year  What?  The dynasty is over  Two?  And that's it?  Well now  They had a pretty fucked up  Team all year though  They won three out of four  How's that not a dynasty?  It's not a dynasty  Three out of four  Three in a row  Three in a row  Is a dynasty  No one's won three in a row though  I know  So there's never been a dynasty 
[01:02:30]  Never a dynasty  Fair enough  Alright  Okay  Fair enough  That's consistent  To win that one  It's consistent  What about the Steelers?  One for the thumb in 81  One for the thumb in 81  It's not a dynasty  According to Anthony  No  No  They won two  Then they won another two  They didn't win three  Oh they didn't win in a row  No  Alright  If you win two  Then why the slogan  One for the thumb  Wait wait wait  I'm thinking  You know that means  Five in a row  Oh no  They was going for five  Going for five  Within  Within 
[01:03:00]  Let me tell you something  Okay  Did they win two  Lost one  And then won two more  No  They  I think they  What did they go  Seventy  Someone get the Super Bowl  Winners up for us  They won two  They won two  They won two  Now it was with  All the same players  So it couldn't have been  That far  A difference  And I think maybe  The Cowboys won one  In the middle there  If that was four  Out of five years  Then  79-80  And then I think  They won in 76-77  I think  Alright we're going to  Find out in seconds here  But the Pats weren't 
[01:03:30]  Supposed to do anything  Their team was pretty beat up  I mean  Colts choked  Yeah but how about  How many bad calls  There were all weekend  The NFL refs  Made so many bad calls  Oh no  In every game  I'm not just  The Asante Samuels call  Was terrible  But that Pittsburgh call  Yesterday  Was pathetic  See Boomer  Just trashed the NFL  And I'm glad  He did too man  What's his name  Grabbed their head  And fart in their face  And they were trying to eat  It was a good play  By one of these new  Everybody's Samoan now  When the fuck  There's Samoan  And fucking  Jimmy Schnuckers  Become  The greatest  Troy 
[01:04:00]  With tribal  You're so right  Where the fuck  Do they come from  This pool  Of  Of  Of  Parisian  Where the fuck  These  Polynesian  Motherfuckers  With hair  Down to their ass  They're gonna  Fuckin'  Ha-Fu  Ala-Hama-Hala-Mala  He's gonna  Attempt this kick  You're right  Scott from Utah  What's up?

[01:05:00]  Wanted the Colts  To go to the Superbowl  It's a great story  There's nobody  I'm against right now  I don't mind  If any of these  Steelers gonna win it all  I would love  For the Steelers to win  Because just to see  Jerome Bettis  The bus  I fucking love that guy  That could have been  His last play of his career  Yesterday  Can you fucking  Fubbles the ball  You know what  You just go  There's a guy  And there was a guy  Twice in that  It's like oh my god  He fumbled  Tony Dungy  Like that whole  My son got killed himself  Like we're gonna let that happen  God's gonna say 
[01:05:30]  You gotta get this guy  Or something  But you figure  You figure  Jerome Bettis  God Trump  Is not over  Like you know  You know what I mean  Karma Trump  Where it's like  You know  Give Jerome a fucking thing  Or my son kills himself  Karma  You feel what I'm saying  Like it's like  You figure like  Oh my god  It was creepy  That he fumbled  But then it's like  Okay Ben Roethlisberger  But I said  They're gonna win  This god damn game  Man  And then  Vandyjack misses  That is creepy  He hasn't missed  A field goal  Since he was 17 years old 
[01:06:00]  Or something  He missed it by a mile  I know  He wasn't even close  How far out was it  It was  For the 40s  It was a chip shot  And then Dungy  That's a long fucking  Not for him  Not inside  Did you see  The clip of Dungy's face  Going  He missed it  He missed it  Like he missed it  No Payton said that  So did Dungy  And so did Bill Coward  I saw Payton's reaction  Where he's like  He missed that  He missed it  Payton man  He's a pussy  You can't believe it  Alright here we go  75 Steelers beat the Vikings  76 
[01:06:30]  They beat the Cowboys  79  77  It was the Raiders  And then 79  Over the Vikings  78  It was the Cowboys  Over the Broncos  And then 79  Steelers  I thought you were just  Talking about Pittsburgh  And then Steelers  Yeah but  They missed two years  In a row there  They won two  Lost two  Won two  I would say that's a dynasty  Dude  I mean  For football  There's a few dynasties  There's San Francisco  There's Green Bay  There's now the Patriots  Are in there  And Dallas 
[01:07:00]  The 90's Dallas  You see Montana  Running through the airport  Those commercials are great  Jerome Bettis  He looks silly dude  I love those  Montana making some  Quick little cute moves  In the airport  Or wherever he is  So what  You gotta give Green Bay  A dynasty  You gotta give the Dolphins  A dynasty  You gotta give every  There's only one too  You got two in a row  That's a dynasty  That's not a dynasty  That's not a dynasty  I'm talking about  Just impact man  It's like  Three is an impact  Four is great  You see Bettis' parents 
[01:07:30]  Going crazy in the stands too  His parents have gone  They've missed what  Two games of his whole career  Yeah they missed  Two preseason games  One was in Mexico  One was in Japan  And one was in  Mexico  I tell you  If I hit it big  My mother would be  You know  Shit  He changed the whole  Family's life  You know  When you do that  When you can take care  Of your mama  She better come to my game  My mother should be  At web junk 20  He got that first down  Behind the green screen  When he pushed  Roethlisberger  When he pushed him  Just a push he gave him  To get him that first down  That guy's strong

[01:09:00]  Yeah he wants to coach  That's pretty good for 80  And what's his name  He's like telling him  Calm down Marv  Calm down  There's no hope  There's no hope  You know  There's some franchises  You go there's no  I'll tell you man  The Patriots  You know  I'm a fan of the Patriots  And what changed them  Was Bill Parcells  Who just goes  Bill Parcells comes in  And goes  Get rid of these  This stupid  Fucking  Logo  This is not even  Up to date  There's no aerodynamic  Anything to this  Dumb guy  Holding the football  Oh the stupid  Old Pat's logo  Right  The squatting  Taking his dump  Or taking it up

[01:49:30]  Jesus  I thought our career  Was screwed  I don't think so guys  So I heard you're out in Vegas  Did you stay at the Wynn  No  Ben did some drinking over there  I think  We were at the MGM  I've been at the MGM  You've got to  Next time you go out there  Go to the Wynn Hotel  You stayed there  I stayed at the Wynn  I do shows out in Vegas  Like once or twice a year  I love it out there  Nice  It's really  Yeah I heard Wynn  It's just unbelievable  I think it's like  $8.50 a night  But it's worth every penny  They've got flat screen TVs  All over the place  You've got huge huge space up there 
[01:50:00]  You've got a view of the strip  Second to none  And it's  You never have to leave the compound  You don't have to leave the compound  No  What's different about the casino  And the lobby and all that  It's just  You know look  It's newer  It's nicer  It's the latest and greatest  It's just fun  I like the Bellagio too  I like it  Yeah Bellagio's nice  Yeah definitely  What do you play  Usually craps  Or a little poker  Or a little bit of blackjack  That's all  Yeah  I lose my shirt 
[01:50:30]  Who doesn't  You've got to pay for that building  It's huge  Oh we've got to  We've got to pay for something  No one wins in Vegas  That is the biggest scam going  No I've had times  When I've walked out of there  Yep  Yeah but then you go  You know what  I just won whatever  I'm going to go  Treat myself to state tonight  You leave every dollar behind  No matter what  And I figured it all out  Huh  Because I'm so stupid  I'll be up $500  Or $1,000  And then I'll say  Alright roll it on this one hand  Haha yeah that never works 
[01:51:00]  That never works  That's where you say  Oh well I had a great time  They just know  Occasionally you get to hold their money  For a little while  Yeah  But for the most part  Everyone gives it back  And just  Well Anthony you sounded like you were up the other day  I was up in Texas Hold'em  But I wasn't playing really high stakes games  So I didn't make back as much as I lost playing three card poker  Okay  So I left down about $1,500  Yeah  But I had a great time 
[01:51:30]  Had a lot of fun  And you know  XM flies us out there  Puts us up  So  That's not a bad deal  You know  I would have paid a lot more than that  Hey Sean  You're going to have one of our faves on your show today huh  Bob Grant  We love Bob Grant  Bob is on your show  Bob Grant will be checking in today  There's not many radio guys we like  But Bob Grant is one of them  Well let me tell you something  Spot Sheem  You make sure you tell him  That we said hello  John Minnelli was trying to hire him at W 
[01:52:00]  NEW at the time  It would have been a great move  And he was walking through the halls  And Anthony and I were so starstruck  We're like holy shit  Bob Grant's in the building  We were in the same arena  Because look  How many of us grew up listening to him  Yep  For the rest of the country  You've got to understand  This guy was the real deal  He would just scream and yell at old ladies  And tell them he's going to knock their teeth out  When somebody wasn't  When somebody wasn't making sense  That's the best part about it  When someone was not making sense  Or babbling  Or just calling to compliment him 
[01:52:30]  He's a let's get to the point kind of guy  Yeah  And he would unload on some people  And it was done with such humor  But do you think he ever realized  Just how funny he was  That's it  He never came across like he knew  How funny he was being  When he would scream  Hey  Get off my phone  You creep  You creep  Or someone would make a point  And quietly  You'd almost think he was going to agree  With the guy  He'd go  Well thank you for your point 
[01:53:00]  Somebody please get me my digitalis  I am disgusted with you  And you will not pollute my phone lines again  I'm going to try and get to the real story  I don't believe he's walking out of there on his own  Nah  I don't either  I don't either  I think it's a typical radio story  Except maybe this is one of those moments  Where they actually got  They give somebody an opportunity to do a last show  It's been ten years since he walked out of WABC  Wow  Look you guys know what it's like to be under fire in New York 
[01:53:30]  Yep  And when he was under fire  It was huge  It was all over the place  And it was because of comments that he had made about Ron Brown  Oh yeah  I don't know if everybody remembers when Ron Brown's plane went down  He was the Commerce Secretary at the time  There was one report that there had been one survivor  Yeah  And Grant went on the air and he said  I know it's him  After all I'm a pessimist  Yeah  I mean  And he's apologized for it 
[01:54:00]  He said he shouldn't have said it  I don't think he should have been fired for it  No  No I don't think he should have been fired for that  And he should say stuff like that  What the hell  We need it all on the airwaves  Well I think we got you guys now saying everything  I don't think there's anything left to say  We try  We try Sean  There's plenty  I did feel like a loss of love  Because I  You know you guys don't call me anymore  But I tuned in the other day  And there's Danny Bonaduce  Now I know I can't top his stories of drug use, sex and rock and roll  What happened 
[01:54:30]  I was at that guy's house  In the 2000  When they were having the  What do you call it  One of the conventions were out there  Oh one of those radio conventions  No one of the presidential conventions  Look at how stupid I am  I'm trying to relate to Sean Haya  You mean one of those radio junkets  We've all known  The one that picks the leader of the free world  Oh that one  Yes of course  We can all relate to that Sean  I went to Bonaduce's house  It has a beautiful house  High up on the hills  And I guess it's Los Angeles 
[01:55:00]  He's got a wife  Who is really really extremely religious  Very nice woman  And he supposedly had turned his whole life around  And then I tune into you guys  And now he's worse than he's ever been  Yeah we've heard about his recoveries over the years  And each time he trips again  It seems to be worse and worse  Yeah and he seems to love it more and more  Yeah well the publicity  I think he enjoys that  And I can't get enough of that type of TV  That whole celebrity thing 
[01:55:30]  I can't get enough of these guys  Just showing it all now  And when did our favorite ex-white sitcom star  Become roided up animals  Peter Brady and fucking Danny Bonaduce  Are just  They look dangerous  Danny Bonaduce looks like he can actually whoop somebody's ass  Oh these guys are ready for ultimate fighting  He has yeah  Something happens  Anthony you made the point when you were interviewing him  Every single childhood star is messed up  Yeah they have some kind of problems  And I think it comes from the 
[01:56:00]  Not having that childhood  They always say that  He didn't have a childhood  Not chunk from the Goonies  I think they just get addicted to all the fame and celebrity  And they spend the rest of their lives  Trying to recapture what they once had  Chasing that  Yeah when you had it so young  Yeah then you're kind of lost when that goes away  They would have gotten it when they were mature like you guys  Hey Sean  We're kind of discussing TV in this segment here  What does Sean Hannity watch  When he's not doing the radio show?  Like we're talking about Celebrity Fit Club 
[01:56:30]  And the new Flavor Flav show  We're going to get into in a little while  I cuddled up with a case of some donuts  And a 24 hour binge on C-SPAN  It's not really that bad  Although I do have my moments watching the History Channel and A&E  I'm constantly watching those  I love the crime shows  Thank you  And I love the war shows  World War II documentaries  I can't get enough of those  I watched a block of bitches in prison on MSNBC  MSNBC 
[01:57:00]  Oh shit man  They're doing some stuff on Friday nights  It was like bitches in prison  I watched it last night  The Folsom prison thing  Oh I didn't see the Folsom prison one  Anthony ask him if he's going to watch  Lincoln was a nigga love on A&E  Coming up  Are you going to get into that there Anthony?  No bastard  Sean  Yeah listen to this  Lincoln was a crazy motherfucker  Just to let Sean know  Anthony has a whole theory on the Lincoln thing  There's a show that's going to be on the History Channel  About Abe Lincoln  And they're talking about his personal life 
[01:57:30]  And how  I think the slug line is  He was fighting two wars  One was in his head  Yeah the depression  That's been said for years  Yeah  Boris Kearns Goodwin has a book out  Team of Rivals  I'm reading it now  And it was the police  I'm reading a million little pieces  I'm reading the back page of the Post  Someone's got to do it man  Somebody's got to  How is your brain wired  Where you walk into a bookstore  And that's the book you pick up  Sean  I'm a total loser  I admit it  No he's Sean Hannity 
[01:58:00]  Well people  We do two different  He wasn't always Sean Hannity  But I'm saying  There was a time he walked into a bookstore  And he went right  For the boring books  No but is he  Are you more informed now  That you have to be  Or are you always just a dude  That would read everything  It's what I do  Look Anthony has this side of him  Yeah absolutely  If he had his way  Wouldn't even know who the president is  Absolutely  I think it's a waste of time  To know these fuckers  You follow politics pretty closely  Absolutely  I like sports  I like politics 
[01:58:30]  I like the issues of the day  And I've got to stick with the topics I know about  You guys can talk a lot about sex  I've been married 13 years  I don't know anything about it  Alright what's this book about?  What?  Going back to the book you're reading  That relates to Lincoln  It's the political genius of him  Lincoln literally was not supposed to win the nomination for the Republican Party when he was running  And he had all these smart guys  They were intellectually superior  They had better and more superior political skills  And it just talks about not only how he 
[01:59:00]  I thought we were talking about Lincoln not Bush  Well Bush has been great  Come on  The democratization of the region  You've got to see  Through the spectrum of history  You've got to see that this was a critical moment  In the movement of freedom and liberty in the world  Through the spectrum of history  That's correct  Through the spectrum of history  Well anyway Lincoln basically outmaneuvered all his critics  And how he was able to put a coalition together  Of the very people that were opposing him  For the nomination  And he ended up being a great president 
[01:59:30]  And that's the book you're reading?  But what about that mistake he made free and a slave?  I never said it was a mistake on this Martin Luther King Day  Anthony goes up he's a crazy sucker  What I said was  And it had nothing to do with his mental problems  Was the fact  That one of the considerations  To freeing the slaves  Was to really undermine  The power that the South did have  It ruined their industry  And it was a great strategic move 
[02:00:00]  For a war  It wasn't just out of the kindness of his heart  He decides during a war  Hey I'm just going to throw  The black people a bone  And free them  It was about  Making the South weaker  By taking away their workforce  Sean  Listen to Sean  Hello  Hello  Listen to Sean Hannity's like  Uh huh  Well  You hear that phone ring in the back  I've got a final answer  You talk about that if you like to mister 
[02:00:30]  I bet you Sean Hannity has a phone ring in the background  The whole time he's on the air  Just in case he gets uncomfortably goes  Whoa whoa this one I've got to take  Why can't we just talk about history  How quiet was that  Lincoln was just doing that  That was one of them  It just  But it's known  Freeing the slaves  There was a movement that rightly found it morally repugnant  The institution of slavery 
[02:01:00]  Lincoln was part of that movement  Right  It was a major part and major component of what the Civil War was about  I understand  That's why I didn't say it was his sole reasoning  Was to destroy the South  But that was a consideration  It's not as if  Over the years Lincoln has been looked at as this saint  That out of the goodness of his heart freed the slaves  But it was found out that he lost a bet  That was a big part of his motivation  Look even our founders  Even some of them that owned slaves were leading hypocritical lives 
[02:01:30]  They found slavery morally repugnant  They wanted to get rid of it  If they would have tried to end it  Say in 1787  When we were forming our constitution  They would not have been able to do it  So in their genius  I would argue  They put in place  The means by which  Over time  That they would be able to  To right wrongs and correct injustices  To downsize slavery  We left it  We're downsizing slavery over the course of our schedule 
[02:02:00]  Hope would be eliminated  Right, right  I understand that  The thing is  Why then didn't Lincoln immediately free the slaves?  Because it wasn't good for the country  It wasn't good business wise  To the north  It just  It wasn't a good thing  For the country at that time  Until  It hurt the enemy  Well because  The nigger police had to stand around for a while 
[02:02:30]  To learn how to control their own areas  So they had to just stay there for a little while  No, Patrice  I didn't say  Boy, you know  It is so hard to shell out an argument  And not just get crucified  The insurgents  I think he's got your checkmate here  No, he doesn't  Thank you, Sean, Harry, sir  And I'm on your side  No more fucking combs  Damn  I said no more combs  All right, Sean  You guys haven't caused any trouble 
[02:03:00]  Cause some trouble  So we can bring you back on TV  We're trying  We came close a few times recently  Yeah, no, I heard about it  Yeah, we'll try to stay  All right  We'll try to keep our jobs  I think we'll move a little closer to that line  Every time I hear about it  No, we want to be around for a while  Sean Hannity, it's always a pleasure  All right, guys  Good to talk to you  You're on XM 124 today  At 3 p.m. Eastern time  And one of our faves  I'm telling you  Bob Grant's on with Sean Hannity today  Yeah, definitely check  Check that out  And really, Sean  Tell Bob we said hi  We've always been huge fans, man 
[02:03:30]  He's in the studio  And tell him you said hello  All right  Thank you, Sean  All right  How genius was his silence  His silence  He had a phone ringing in the background  I love it  And he's such a  He's such a politician  With everything he does  He's very diplomatic  I bet you he set that up  And said, all right  Had his wife just ring the house phone  The entire time  He was on the air  So he had an out  Not on Martin Luther King's birthday  Not on Martin Luther King's  In the back  He's in the back  The phone's going  Bring  Yeah, yeah, yeah  So bring 
[02:04:00]  Then you get to Lincoln  It goes  Ring, motherfucker  Lincoln, get out of here  I want to find  One  One  One motherfucker  That agrees  That god damn it  If he was so fucking noble  Billy Burr will agree with you  If he was so noble  Get that  Day one  And do you accept  The presidency  As he got his hand on the bible  For the inauguration  I accept  The presidency  Of the United States  Of America  Free the fucking slaves  Yeah, none of these  I'm sure the plan  It was an ulterior motive 
[02:04:30]  In there  This whole idea  Of exit strategy  For Baghdad  Or whatever  It's like  You gotta have strategy  To that  Because you gotta understand  Even people in the north  Didn't like black people  But that's the reason  Listen  To go back  Not to get to this Jew thing again  But that's the reason  We didn't go to war  Right away in World War II  Is cause they didn't want  The country to think  We was fighting for Jews  Right  So you can't go in  And go  Okay, I'm the president  Hey  We gonna let slaves free 
[02:05:00]  White people are racist  So he had to be very careful  When he did it  Black people are racist too though  Race thing  See  So what  The race thing  I think  I was just saying  Call us racist  The race thing  Was the smallest part of it  You guys gotta  The race issue  Was the smallest part  Of Lincoln  Fringing the slaves  The race issue  Smallest part  The big  The fucking north  Ran on  The materials  From the south  The reason the north  Was so rich 
[02:05:30]  Was because they got  So much cheap material  From the south  To make shit  Why do you think  That material was so cheap  Slave fucking labor  If all of a sudden  Now the south  Had to pay workers  The north is gonna  Pay more for materials  And not make as much money  It's always  Alright  Ready  It's always about money  People  So wait a minute  Anthony  Always  So if  If your  Your idea that  Okay why didn't he just  Free him  Right  Right  So now they're free  Right  Why didn't they just  Bring him back 
[02:06:00]  Why didn't they just  Why  Oh no  Slavery  Why isn't slavery  Just  Alright you know what  We want slavery again  That shit didn't work out  Alright I'd like to announce  My new platform  I am  Trying to get  Why didn't they bring it back  I'm saying  If it wasn't  Moral  If it wasn't  A moral  Issue  Why isn't slavery  It became  A moral issue  Alright  And it was part  Moral issue  Look at  Oh he goes  Alright  All I'm thinking  That fuck slaves  No all I'm thinking  I don't give a fuck 
[02:06:30]  About that  All I care about  Is Bill Burr's been  Outside the studio  For 45 minutes  Trying to get  I can't  Look at  Once you bring  Billy in  It's stereo hunkies  With Lincoln  Stereo hunkies  Bill will agree with you  Because Bill  Bill doesn't like  Black folks  I'm his only  Bill doesn't like  Black folks  Let me tell you something  Bill only tries  To learn about  Black people  So he can use  It against them  He's so politically  Correct when  Bill Burr  Is in the studio  Billy  Nigga Billy  Is  Motherfucking  Listen  Billy dates 
[02:07:00]  Black chicks  He loves  Black people  He knows more  About black people  Than you  Sleeping with the enemy  That is  That's his trick  Listen with that  We're going to go to break  It's MLK day  As we go to break  We'll play  Boo Got Shot  I love Boo Got Shot  With the white translation  For Martin Luther King Day  Listen to this  It appears the young lady  Was trembling  From nervousness  Someone has been wounded 
[02:07:30]  I inquired as to  Who the victim was  Boo got shot  Boo has suffered  A gunshot  Boo got shot  Boo has become  The victim of another  Violent crime  I said oh my god  Oh my god  Oh me oh my  We just saw it  My sister had called  Somebody  My sibling telephoned  Another relative  She called my cousin  Pumpkin  To sell dust  In fact  It was my cousin  Pumpkin  Who lives  In this very same community  She called her  And Pumpkin told her  That she was on the phone  With Pauline  Pumpkin was already 
[02:08:00]  On the phone  With the local authorities  And Chi Chi  She had left out  Chi Chi had already departed  She went down  Her car  She bailed out  She found her vehicle  And put it in reverse  And when she left out  Then when I heard  The gunshot again  As she was departing  A shot rang out  Piercing the cold night air  When I heard the gunshot  And I seen  Someone had running  The beard no fat that way  Apparently the perpetrator  Was seeking cover  Behind a local building  She ran that beard  It was that building  Over there 
[02:08:30]  And I seen  That car  That thing  Flew off  I saw the car depart  With a rapid acceleration  And then I seen  A long gun  I saw a firearm  Of substantial caliber  A big old gun  I mean substantial caliber  The boy was in the backseat  He had a big old long gun  In fact  It was the gentleman  In the backseat  Who had the firearm  With the extended barrel  Fight the power  Fight the power  Fight the power  Fight the power 
[02:09:00]  Fight the power  It's Martin Luther King Day  So doing something  A little different  With the music  In studio  Patrice O'Neill  And now Bill Burr  Sorry to make your way  Bill  Not a problem  But Sean Hannity called  And he threw us off  A little bit  But he gave us good radio  And I don't even know  Why we broke  Because we just did  Another 20 minutes of radio  Now we've got to  Redo it for the radio  Talking about the cotton gin  And the horse  Oh god damn 
[02:09:30]  I forgot about that already  Well we've got to  Talk about that  Getting sick on planes  And the grizzly man  The grizzly man  I missed the cotton gin thing  So you're going to have  To explain that to me  I came in the studio  And you guys are just  Losing your fucking minds  We were continuing  Our ongoing discussion here  I had a whisper to E-Rock  I'm like  What the fuck is going on  About slavery  And Patrice made a valid point  That you can't just  Come into office  Especially back then  As Lincoln  Or in certain situations 
[02:10:00]  As any president  Throughout history  And just say  I'm going to do this  That's something  That might not be popular  You have to wait  Until a situation arises  That gives you the opportunity  To do that  For Lincoln  It was the Civil War  So I was asking  You know  Well  If the Civil War  Never happened  Would we still have slaves then  What if this  Golden opportunity  Never brought itself up  And then  Bill  Said  Brought up the cotton gin  And  I said yeah  Slaves would become 
[02:10:30]  Obsolete  Or obsolete  Or becoming obsolete  Yeah just like when  When we made the car  He didn't need horses anymore  No  Look at you two  Cocksuckers  It's no matter what  Here's white people  It's like  With the radio  Shut the fuck up  Obie for instance  Fuck y'all  Cause  And with white people  Do a fine job  To keep us down  Exactly  Off the fucking record  I hate that shit  Off the record  Y'all motherfuckers  Are like man  You guys are perfect  You hear that story  It's going  And then  You know  Lincoln  I'm not racist 
[02:11:00]  And then  As I was saying  See I'm not racist  No one ever said that  On this show  Shut up  Wait a minute  So Billy goes  Billy goes  Yeah man  You know  Like the horses  Cause I go  Okay the cotton gin  You go  You think there would be slavery  I go  No because the cotton gin  Would have took the place  The slaves  So Billy  So I said  You don't even need a couple  You know  So Billy goes  Yeah just like horses  When they made the car  So then they'd be racing niggas  And what if the cotton gin  Had the  Horsepower 
[02:11:30]  And the cotton gin  Had nigger power  How much nigger power  How do you measure  A cotton gin  Nigga I got a 500 nigger power  Cotton gin  I've seen one get up to 90  NPH  I got half a ship worth  Yeah because they still talk about cars and horsepower  And that's an archaic kind of scale  I know Billy not a racist  We all having fun  But it's something about society 
[02:12:00]  That just makes a white guy have to be careful  When he's opening up his fucking racial mouth  Well that's why I'm not careful  I am not careful  I don't  I present facts  The way I see them  Sometimes they're a little off kilter  I understand  But I am  There's a flag waving right behind you  Let me tell you something  I don't  I don't just blurt this stuff out  I am well informed  You know the only motherfucker that walks around with a bag of footnotes  Just in case 
[02:12:30]  Just in case  Anthony  Anthony  Cumia did not say this  This was said by Johnson Riggles  In 1902  He said  Let's go to paragraph 3  From section 265  Of the  Lick at his fingers  See now this says right here  I'm just quoting  I'm quoting gentlemen  Don't beat me senseless  You don't attack anybody  Attack Johnson  He's the one who says  Bill I noticed you're a little sick too by the way 
[02:13:00]  Now I'm wondering if I got you sick  Because the last time I saw you  Was a week ago today  And I started getting sick  Right in front of everyone  And I was like  Holy shit  Everyone tries to point the finger  I'm getting sick  I'm getting sick  Well then you had to fly out to San Francisco  No no  See airplanes  Yeah  Airplanes is what does  If I fly all the way across  If you're on a plane for fucking six hours in the winter  Done  And you haven't gotten eight hours sleep  And taken all kinds of items  You're getting sick  You know they finally did a piece of that on TV  They finally did it  Because people were like  Are you really getting sick in those planes  You know  And they were saying something like this 
[02:13:30]  If a guy sneezes in a plane  He infects the three rows in front of him  And the two rows behind him  Great  One sneeze  Takes out six fucking rows in a plane  And then it gets sucked up by the ventilation anyway  And spread all over the plane  You breathe in and breathe out that sneeze  Like fucking  Oh  20 times  So many times  But they say they filter the air much better these days in planes  So that's not the biggest problem  And they also say that little nozzle  Is safe 
[02:14:00]  Because it kind of keeps like the shit from coming at you  So you've got to keep the nozzle on full blast  On full blast  You want to point it at the sick person  Yeah  Point it at the sick person  Like a freaking fire hose  Just keep away  Keep your germs off of me  No what they did say was to stay away from those tray tables  They say if you don't  If you are a paranoid guy  And you think you're going to get sick on a plane  Don't even touch the tray table  Why?  What's on there?  Just the virus  The flu virus could live for two days 
[02:14:30]  Right there on the surface in front of you  Two days  You're going to look crazy  Really?  Oh yeah  Fucking flu virus  I'm going to fucking sneeze right on the tray table  On the tray table?  Because it's in front of you  And you might sneeze  Like or is it any open beverage?  Don't touch it  I've never seen them clean a plane  I'll be honest with you  I've never seen them clean up a plane  They don't have time to clean up a plane  When you're not on it  They come in and vacuum  They don't have time  And then they clean up  They're turning those fucking things around so fast 
[02:15:00]  How many times do you get on a filthy fucking plane?  Dude they have a crew  They have a crew that just quickly  They come in with those little bags  That's it  Because I've left my cell phone on there  Yeah  And they basically said  Well you better hurry up  Because they're cleaning it up  Meaning that they would have stolen the fucking thing  So do you think these people are vacuuming?  They just throw it in a bag  And then someone comes through it  Not really  It's not a clean  It's just they don't do it  I'm not talking germ free  They're not fucking windexing the tray  They don't even wipe anything down  They don't do anything  They don't wipe down  Dude they turn those planes around  They don't have time  They're like buses man  Those people get off 
[02:15:30]  They came from Houston  And you get on that plane  I thought it was like my planes coming in  They're bringing it out of the parking lot  Pull mine around  Hey they're getting ready to pull my plane out  Out of the beginning  Fucking newly fly  You're like  It's like  Alright get out  Come on  Alright  It's like that Chinatown bus  It's like a $12 round trip to go to Boston  I only figured that out recently  One of my flights was delayed  I'm like  Like you  What?  They're having a problem opening the garage door? 
[02:16:00]  What's wrong with my plane?  Where is it?  It's like  Oh no  We're still waiting for it to come in from fucking Cleveland  And then those people get off  And you get right back  I thought it was just like  Oh right  Yeah they're cleaning it  It's going to be shiny  Yeah they got it all  Air fresheners  All polished up nice for you  Do you drink at all on the plane?  Not really  Well they say the water  In most cases  Is just coming from a jug  Yeah but fuck the water  I'm talking drink  Do you have a Bloody Mary?  No  Do you have a fucking whiskey?  That's the key 
[02:16:30]  You gotta have a little alcohol in your system  You know I love this  Everybody has like the cure for the common cold  But they haven't like exploited it  And made like millions of dollars off of it  Dude I  They just decided to tell a select few of their friends  Dude you know what you gotta do?  Dude I got in a fight with Jim Norton over that shit  Cause I finally had it  Cause I was starting to get sick  And he's like oh you gotta try the uh  I think I have it  No what was his?  Cause he'll get mad if I do the wrong one  His cure?  His is coldies right?  Oh he loves like 
[02:17:00]  He's like I'm telling you dude  If you take the coldies  You don't get sick  A little cherry thing  Yeah and then you talk to someone else  It's like nah it's all about the emergency bro  If you take the emergency you're fine  And then someone else  Nah it's airborne man  Airborne  The one by the teacher  Yeah  Cause they can't prove if it works or doesn't work  But Jimmy and I got in a fight  Cause everyone  Just stay sick  Everyone has their fucking remedy for this shit  And none of it works  You just gotta ride it out  I think some of this stuff initially works  And then once everybody starts taking it  Then the cold's like oh this shit again  They're on to it 
[02:17:30]  Yeah they know your gameplay  They mutate  You're not gonna like it  Obi's not gonna like it  Anybody sick is not gonna like this  But how I keep from getting sick a lot  And I don't get sick  Is you fucking sneeze  As hard as you can  Without covering your fucking mouth  When you sneeze  You go  And get that shit out  And you go  That's the dumbest shit I've ever fucking heard  I have not gotten sick  I'm a motherfucker  It's as good as coldies  Cause I haven't 
[02:18:00]  If you fucking  You know if you haven't got enough sleep  You know what you do  You just yawn  As hard as you possibly can  You just go  And you do not need to sleep  For another three days  Treat O'Neal everybody  You and a weak body motherfuckers  That getting sick  I'm telling you I'm not sick  I haven't been sick in months  I'm telling you  If you sneeze  And don't cover your fucking mouth  Dude you're a big game man  You're like a fucking gazelle over here  He's on to something I think 
[02:18:30]  And the germs all over your hands right  Exactly  It's like  Fuck that plate shit  That polite shit  I go  And it just  It's gone  The fucking idea of a cold is gone  Gets the evil out of your body  It's like voodoo  Yeah it's voodoo  You got some kind of fucking voodoo  Oh black people in your remedies  All you gotta do is drink collard green juice  And chase a duck  And you will be cured  Chop off the chicken's head  Anything is as good as being sick 
[02:19:00]  I mean if you get sick  You know you might as well try anything  You know what I'm saying  I've tried them all  The airborne  None of that shit works  That's basically it  And you're right  If one of these worked  Trust me  It would be the headline  On all the fucking news programs  The sickness has done you well  You look like a crew member  From the Calypso  It's like  Oh Bill's doing the South thing  Yeah you can both be both  Don't you look like  Jacques Cousteau's crew  Usually I bring like  A baseball cap with us  But I was so tired this morning 
[02:19:30]  I forgot  I'm like  Well I'm getting trashed  They really are dressed like  The Falcon  Hit right and hit on to  A rumble  At least I like  Faisal  Who's still in the  Men of the Calypso  Descended to a depth  Of 3,500 feet  I'm dressed like Bobby  I try to shave down a little bit  I'm actually dressed like Bobby  When he's in shape  Right before he does his headshot  Oh poor Bobby  That is Bobby's  New headshot clothes  Bobby has  He has the  Long John sweater  I've never seen  I feel bad  If anybody I pray for  More in this world  Is Bobby Kelly 
[02:20:00]  Because he just went from  Like a cute  Fucking hair  Perfect kind of  Dude to this  Round  Balding little man  And it's just  It's so beautiful  The guy has the worst luck too  You hear what happened to him  Over the weekend  With MySpace  You know MySpace  Is like his  Plug Central  Fucking website  Well because he was  I would date cooking  And it did him well  He had like over  10,000  Fucking friends on there  And by friends  It's potential people  That you can send  Mailers out to  Or your appearances  He had audio 
[02:20:30]  Video  I mean  It was a nice  MySpace site  He gets a letter  From MySpace  That says  You have violated  The terms of the agreement  By using copywritten material  On your site  Boom  Gone  They erased his site  They zapped his site  Zapped his site  Now he has 90 friends  And a new name  Just Bob  Like everything else  Is taken  Oh my god  Yeah he had like  Bobkelly.com  I guess was his name  And now it's Bobkelly  The website  10012  No now it's just Bob 
[02:21:00]  A thousand Bobs  And he's one of them  They fuck it  And I said  Who turned them in  What did they do  He goes  Someone turned  Now it's conspiracy  Someone turned me in  I think it might have been  The Angelina Jolie video  I had on there  Or something with her  Saying something about  MySpace  And his show  Or something  Like I have no idea  What it was  But he goes  Watch it  Because his account  Got zapped  There's no getting it back  That sucks  No court of MySpace  To appeal to 
[02:21:30]  If anybody  You wanted to destroy  His MySpace  Would be Dane fucking Cook  With his 8 million friends  And he would just go  You know Dane  He used a  You know  He used the fucking  Audio of  Lou Rawls  Saying goodbye  So  You should get off  And shit  Everyone on there  Has got music clips  Everyone's got music clips  You put them right on the site  When your site comes up  It plays a song  That's copyright infringement  You got sabotaged  Somebody turned their man  Someone's fucking them up  Poor Bobo 
[02:22:00]  Hey and the other thing  We talked  While you guys were listening  To promos  Over and over again  My buddy Bill Burr here  I feel like we're brothers today  Because I can tell  With the hats  The hats  I can see in your eyes  You're not 100% yet  Are you?  No  He's waging two battles  One in his head  One with the virus  I'm waging  I got two battles  Two battles  One in my head  And one in my lungs  Right now  Trying to get this shit out  But Bill saw  One of my favorite documentaries 
[02:22:30]  We talked about it on the show  You still haven't seen it  Haven't seen it yet  Must see  Somebody was in here  And we went off on it  For a little while  Joe Rogan  Was it Rogan?  Oh yeah  It was me and Rogan  We're going at it  Another nut  The grizzly man  The grizzly  Rogan would have made him tap out  He kicks the bear's ass  For a rear naked choke  The fucking bear  Wants the audio destroyed  Makes him look bad  Are you ready?  Yeah  Are you ready?  Get it on 
[02:23:00]  Rogan's an animal man  Fucking kick that bear's ass  You see fear factor  Now they got Joe  Just walking up to people's houses  Yeah  Boom boom boom  Hey what's up fuckers?  Come on out  Eat this shit  I get a paycheck  Go fuck yourself  He can't believe that show's still on the air  He told us  He's like  I'll do it  The money's too good  But Bill saw the grizzly man movie  It's called grizzly man?  Grizzly man  I can't get enough of this movie  Accidentally  It's one of the best comedies of last year  Accidentally  Yeah  I laughed out loud 
[02:23:30]  I love when movies become  Unintentional comedies  You're so right  When they're not trying  But there's something about it  That makes it hilarious  Because the dude was clearly a psychopath  And this guy was  The guy who was shooting the video  Was portraying him  As if he was like sane  Right  Yeah  Like at one point  Like he's just sitting there  Like looking at grizzly bears  Like he's clearly just gay  And he's just going  Who's a big bear?  Oh that's a big bear  Who's a big bear?  This fucking thing is like  Ten feet tall 
[02:24:00]  Scratching himself  Up against a tree  And the bear is almost  Fucking weirded out  Just looking at him like  Like what the fuck  What is that?  Weirded out  Yeah like  Absolutely  I don't want to eat that  Confused animal face  Like  God  If I run out of fish  Yeah look  There's a reason  Last case  There's a reason  I'm living out in the wilderness  They ate that young before  They ate that fucking gay dude  They finally just  There's a reason  They live out there  They don't want to deal with  The likes of you  I did see clips of it 
[02:24:30]  I haven't seen the whole movie  And I did see that guy  Just blatantly gay  Well  At one point  He's literally  He has the hand held  With him  And he's looking at  The female bears  Going like  He was saying some shit  About oh the female bears  He goes  Maybe I'd have a better chance  With you  You know  I can't seem to sustain  A relationship with real women  He goes  You know  I don't know why  But you know  Sometimes I think it'd be easier  If I was gay  You know  Which I'm not  You know  He's just referring to himself  In the third place  And he's alone  Holding his camera  Like in the middle of the wilderness  Telling yourself 
[02:25:00]  You're not gay  In the middle  Of the upper part  Of like fucking Alaska  He's having this  Third dialogue  About his gayness  It's really  It's about  You know what the movie's about  It's about  Acceptance  Because complete lack of acceptance  Of what the fuck  He really was  Because we  His parents wouldn't accept him  Throve this fucking guy  Up to Alaska  And he ends up getting mauled  By a bear  Because he naturally  Wanted to suck a dick  And his dad  Couldn't deal with it  This nigga's like  Treading water  In the coral reef 
[02:25:30]  In Australia  Where all the sharks  Would look at this  You're not gay  I love pussy  I'm not gay  I'm in here with sharks and eels  With a big hammerhead  That's a big hammerhead  Yes you are  If only that big black gentleman  In that McDonald's parking lot  Would have let me in his car  Would have been fine  That's the bear  It's cold out here  It's cold out here  Well the guy wanted to be famous  And it turns out  He ends up living with the bears  Every summer in Alaska 
[02:26:00]  But he went to Hollywood  For a while  He claims that he was  Supposed to be Woody  On Cheers  Oh yeah  That he lost out  To Woody Harrelson  Yeah they go to interview  His parents  And like  You'd think then  That the guy would  Kind of bring up the fact  That this guy  You know  Might have had some  You know  Issues with his  Sexuality  And they got his dad  And he's standing there  On the front lawn  And he's holding  Like a stuffed  Like a little stuffed teddy bear  For some fucking reason  That was like his kids  You know when he was younger  And he's got like  American flags  All over his fucking front lawn 
[02:26:30]  So right there  You know  He's not accepting  So he brings up  Not accepting of his gayness  So the first thing  This dude did  I guess  To try to cover the shit up  Was he went to LA  And according to him  He tested for  Woody Harrelson's part  On Cheers  And it came down  To him and Woody  And they picked Woody  And I guess it crushed him  So  That crushed him  He had to go live with bears  Not the fact that he wanted  To suck a dick  And his father was against it  And yeah  Yeah  It's a great  I like this friend too  His friend  The failed actor 
[02:27:00]  Out in LA  When he was talking about him  And you could see  He clearly rehearsed  What he was going to say  To try to make it dramatic  It's so fucking bad  Another Bob Kelly staple  Right  But  They have all  The guy got mauled  And eaten alive  By a few bears  One bear  One bear  Now if you don't know  The background story  Is this  Him and his girlfriend  Does the movie tell you this  At the end  Like that he was killed  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah  No you pretty much know  From the get go  You do 
[02:27:30]  You know from the beginning  The buzz for the movie  I remember when it came out  Was that you actually  Heard the audio  Of him getting mauled  That's why I didn't want  To go fucking see it  I don't want to fucking see it  But actually  I watched the first five minutes  What a fucking idiot he was  I was like  You know what  I want to see this guy  I want to hear it  I want to see it  I want to hear it  He deserves it  Liz is playing like  Archie Street  And fucking  Picasso Road  Down in the east  East west village  I fucking can't go  I can't go to  Regan's theater  Yeah this  This movie will not be shown  At a Magic Johnson theater 
[02:28:00]  Go down to east east  West east street  In the water  To see  Fucking  Grimman man  Fucking  Artsy horse shit  First 40 customers  With Bergenstocks  Get a free bag of popcorn  I have one of those theaters  In my neighborhood  We go there  Every once in a while  And they  Instead of serving popcorn  They serve  Smoked salmon sandwiches  Oh god  Damn no 
[02:28:30]  How do you get up there  Take the Q  Over to the Z  Down to the M  The double M  Over to the dudes  Just a wonderful picture  It was made in France  It's got French subtitles  It won't be at the Magic Johnson  What the fuck is this  Grizzly  Nigga what  Alright  Alright  Chill chill  But anyway  Chill  That shit don't even look real  Like the shit guys waiting for the CGI bear to come in  That shit don't even look real nigga 
[02:29:00]  You know what  I saw that  What was that movie  Open Water  Yeah  I hated Open Water  I saw that  The Midnight Show  In Times Square  Motherfuckers  It was like me  And like fucking  Like 30 black people  In there right  And they sold that movie  Like it was gonna be Jaws  The next Jaws  And it was all like  More mental  Like what you would be thinking  And after once  They realized  In the end  That girl just kinda killed herself  And they're playing all this  Dun dun dun  Dramatic music  You just hear  Man that shit is whack 
[02:29:30]  Fuck this movie yo  Dude that movie  Walking out  That movie was filmed on  Fuck this movie yo  That movie was filmed  With like just a dumb  Handheld camcorder  Yeah  The quality of that  I was so disappointed  Cause I bought the hype on that  And the box looked good  And everything  You know it's like  I liked it  I have a fucking  You liked it  I had a huge  I have a huge fear  Of the fucking ocean  I don't need  To see the  Awful  The  Whatever  It was awful  But I mean  You scuba dive 
[02:30:00]  You come up  And the fucking boat is gone  That was a great moment  And you're like  Hey is it coming back  I love when movies like that  That they fail  And then they don't even become  Cult hits  Like I like the fact  That the set up was like  Yeah we gonna  Yeah this Blair Witch  Kinda feel  It's gonna be huge man  It's gonna be huge  And then it just  It flubs at the theater  And then it just never  It never picks up steam  In any other way  And I appreciate that shit  Yeah there's some movies  That have picked up afterwards  You know on video  Like Fast Times  The Ridge of My High  Was a kind of flop 
[02:30:30]  And then bam  It's on video  And it's like humongous  Fridays was like  Bow  But I'm glad  This horse shit  Just you know  That type of thing  You know what I mean  But you know the director  Didn't come out with that  Selling move  That sounds like  The guy who bought it  It's the scariest movie  Since Jaws  And he's like  Dude take it down a few  Kind of a mental  Kind of thing  Yeah  Jaws was a pussy  I wouldn't mention Jaws  As far as this new movie goes  They should have called it 
[02:31:00]  Treading water  Yeah treading  Is that the movie?  The whole movie?  Dude  The whole fucking movie  It's one  Hey we're still here  It's one fucking scene  One treading water  You know what's funny  You get to see them  In their hotel  You get to see them  Go on a dive boat  And then it's them  Treading water  For an hour and a half  Yeah  And you loved it  No big  I didn't say I loved it  I said I liked it  But you liked it  I was so disappointed  Anyway  The grizzly man  Getting back to that  Really fast  So they have the audio  He gets mauled 
[02:31:30]  And eaten alive  Him and his girl  He had a girl  At this time  And the camera was rolling  When he gets eaten  Who wanted to leave  Right  And was afraid of bears  Oh great  I mean that is the ultimate  I don't know how to break up  Did they talk to her family  No  No  They refused to  Yeah no shit  They wanted to sue him  She'll look like  Fucking breeder of an idiot  I was  I went to this movie  I went to this movie  Earlier though  Fucking  And uh  What happened  What happened  I was just laughing at  Just the sadness 
[02:32:00]  Of that like  Sweetie  Listen  You're in the woods  With a faggot  Who likes bears  Yeah  You're not gonna win  In any situation  If you live  With a faggot  Yeah  You're not winning the guy  You're not gonna get  Any money out of this  And he wasn't even like  Like  Oh shit  He's gay  He was just like  I mean  Show tune  Right  Fossy hands  Fossy hands  Just walking through the forest  Hello my baby  Yeah  No doubt  So the video camera was rolling 
[02:32:30]  So they have this audio  And I saw the movie real early  When I found out  You know  Later on  Whatever  That they didn't  They didn't  Fucking play the audio  Oh and that guy  Yeah  He ends up just  You need to destroy this  You really thought  Going into this  Especially because  It's a documentary  That they're gonna play  The audio of him getting eaten  Or at least part of it  Him screaming or something  How's this one  Those Golden Globe  Nominees for best  And he's getting  I don't think  They say he's getting  Eaten right  And his girl  Is taking like  A huge frying pan  And hitting the bear 
[02:33:00]  Over the head  And then the bear  Kills her  And kills her too  And the guy's screaming  Save yourself  Run  Leave me  I can't believe  That doesn't exist  Somewhere  And they fucking  Wouldn't play  Any of this audio  During this documentary  And I was so disappointed  But the guy  This fucking creepy director  Walks around  With the only  Remaining tape of it  Playing it to his  Old girlfriends  And whoever else  Yeah he gets to hear it  Fucking asshole  He got to hear it  And then you see  The reaction of the lady  As she's listening to the audio  With the headphones on 
[02:33:30]  You're like  Motherfucker  In the movie  Yeah  And then  Dramatically  Like after  After it's done  He's stopped  He pushes stop  And then hands over  The tape to her  And basically says  I'm like  If I was you  I would  I would take that tape  And destroy it  Did she  And is it  Yeah she did  I guess she did  What did they show her doing  Like throwing it  In a fucking  Fireplace  Yeah Patrice  I don't think  There's any way  You can download it  You're really  You are just looking  For a rare hope  Somewhere  You can somehow  Someone ran off 
[02:34:00]  Out there  I'm with Patrice  There's a copy  It's not  No one destroys  The only anything  Ever  Ever  You know what  All the ONA fans  Are fucking  Going to be screaming  In the garage  There's a Sapruta film  Or whatever  Right  Of that fucking  Mauling  You know  His hands  Back  To the left  The fucking  Wait  Before any  Documentarian  Got his hands  On this tape  The fucking police  That did the investigation  Yeah it's out there 
[02:34:30]  Had to get the tape  And review it  Absolutely  There's gotta be copies  Of this somewhere  And you're with me  You think he killed himself  In the end  Yeah he definitely  Had like a death wish  Like this guy  I think he wanted it  And then once it was  Happening it  He was like  Oh maybe I should have  Taken drugs  Yeah  No this guy  This guy decided  Out of nowhere  To stay much longer  Than he usually did  And they explain  In the movie  That these  Quote friendlier bears  Leave  Whatever time it was 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  It's checkout time  And all of a sudden  The bad bears come in  But the bad bears  Come in and take over  That habitat  The ones that could survive  A little longer  In the cold weather  And stuff  So the friendlier bears  They go off  And hibernate  They're like  We're done  It's early September  Whatever it is  And then they're replaced  By these even scarier bears  And he knew that  He knew that  And he decided to stay  Because I think he finally  Just had it with his life  And said this is  A hell of a way to go out  Yeah he kept talking  To the camera like  He's like  And no one has ever 
[02:35:30]  Been out here  During this time of the year  And survived  And he's like  If you tried to do it  You would fucking  You would fucking die  You would fucking die  Because we're in  Like a steak necklace  Or anything  Did he ever try to have  Like a dude voice  Like  Or he always kept  The game  Dude he's like  So in denial  Yeah  Dude he literally  What you do is  You watch this  And you watch him  Gradually get crazier  And crazier  Yeah  To the point  He wants to be a bear  Well  That's great  Well he was getting  Some recognition for this  He would come back  With his footage

[02:38:30]  Gonna eat that faggot  Let's go to Nathan  Two thumbs in somebody's ass  Nathan what's up  What's going on guys  Hey  Hey  Saw Bill Burr  Over the weekend  Here in San Francisco  At the punchline  Laughed my balls off  Definitely on cold meds  Though he was definitely  Pretty wired  It seemed like  I was out of it  Somebody put a picture  Up on my  MySpace  Yeah  Of them a picture of me  After my show  I'm all like  Fucking sweaty  And bloated  I literally have  My leather coat on  It's like 80 degrees 
[02:39:00]  In there  I'm freezing  Huh  What was the deal  With that guy  That ran up to the stage  With his cell phone  You just totally  Called him out on it  On Friday night  Oh yeah  Want to show you a picture  Yeah I was making fun  Of how many fucking  Homeless people  They have out there  Like San Francisco  How they just wander  All the way around  This city is so liberal  That they just have  Accepted the homeless  It is unbelievable  How many homeless people  They gave like a stipend  Or something like  Five hundred dollars a month  But I think they finally  Got rid of that  They are laying all  Over the place out there  What a great idea 
[02:39:30]  For a city  Let's pay the homeless  We won't get  Every homeless guy  That could drag himself here  Coming to the city  What they thought  They would do  Would take the money  And pay for rent and food  And what they did  Was they just fucking  Had a drug party  For three days  And then they'd be broke again  You know what some of these  Idiots don't fucking understand  Homeless people are homeless  For the most part  There are some  You know the evil more  There are some  Unfortunate circumstances  Where people fall into  These cracks in life  And become homeless 
[02:40:00]  But for the most part  Homeless people are kooks  They're crazy people  They're insane people  That are not locked up  In an asylum  And what do we need to do  About it Anthony  I don't have the answer  There's no guys  Who got fired  Not pay them  No check to check guys  They got fired  Not like fucking movie  Homeless people  Where you know  The guy was working at IBM  And he got fired  And then this  This chain of events  Happening  He's out on the road  With a fucking  Stick with a kerchief  Tied at the end  And he's  Fun with dick and dick  Homeless 
[02:40:30]  And he's in the shelter  But he befriends  The guy that runs the shelter  How much shit can you  Actually carry around  In that manner anyway  Not much  Jesus  What do you got in there  Not much  Unless they're doubloons  You're fucked  There's nothing  If you're homeless  You're fucking crazy  So if you give them money  They're not going to go  Thank you so much  I'm going to go  And I'm going to get  My resume together  And how could you  Even get an apartment  Do you have references  Or oh yeah  Ask the guy that walks  By the grate  Down there by the subway 
[02:41:00]  He says I never make a peep  They're crazy  Crazy people  I know you don't pay them  I don't know what you do with them  I think you do what  Giuliani tried to do  A few years ago  Round them up  And lock them in mental hospitals  Until the ACLU comes around  And says  That's unconstitutional  Let them back out  Yeah  Giuliani was like  I thought he pushed them  Just to the outer boroughs  Well that was it first  He did a good job  But the ones that wouldn't leave  Treat them like Batman criminals  Treat them like the villains of Batman  This nigga's dressed as a joker

They don't damage you very much  They just  They pinch  That dog was vicious  That little mutt  I don't want that dog around  Biting me in the penis  Man, could you get your dog  Off my penis?

[03:20:30]  Cause I truly don't believe  Women have any  Like that part of them  I believe is null and void  And I go  If I find a bitch  With personality  I test it  To see if it's an actual personality  To see if it's real  If it's like  I'm just a joking ass bitch  I don't care  Yeah  Or if they turn bitch on ya  Just to see if it's fake  Yeah  Just to see if it's fucking fake  I would be attracted to her  Or not attracted  But drawn to her  Because she's pretending  To have a personality  She's not pretending  To be a hoe  She's gonna

[03:21:30]  I tend to believe  There's no woman out there  That nothing bothers  Like a dude  You sit there  Talk shit all day  About this that and the other  But I just don't believe  There's a woman  That just can joke  And be like  Oh my god  That shit's funny  Like I said  I bet your pussy stink  Oh my god  You're crazy  You're so stupid  I bet your balls  They get just funny with it  And not angry with it  And then all of a sudden  Just get pissed off  At one thing you said  And just get  You know  They have some type of  You know  Guys usually are funny  To the core  Type no matter what it is  Laugh at A's 
[03:22:00]  Laugh at midgets  You know  Laugh at anything  You know what I mean  Even though the other  Do you think it's  The motherly instinct  That gets in the way  Of the comedy genius  I'm gonna  I'm gonna tell you  I'm gonna tell you  Something dude  This is  I was so phony  The other day  I had a delivery  Somebody sent a delivery  To my house  This is how we are  But I played a phony thing  Somebody sent a messenger  25 hour messenger  To my house  I had to get something  So they sent it  To the house  About 10.30  I have one of those  Code buttons  You know  You ring  You know  113 or something 
[03:22:30]  And it rings up  To my house  On my phone  I said hello  Yeah  I'm downstairs  With a delivery  And I go  Okay come on up  So there's a woman  I said  I'm on the second floor  Of the apartment floor  So I'm doing something  In my room  I go  Oh shit  I forgot somebody  Was coming up  Usually somebody  Would have been up  Knocking on the door  I go to the door  I go hello  She's like  I'm coming up  And she rounds the corner  On the second floor  She's one of those  Those afflicted midgets  With the hump  On the back  Holy shit  And each step  And each step  She has to  Fling her body 
[03:23:00]  To the next step  Like  Vroom  Vroom  So I  I'm going  Okay God  Let me treat her  It's like that Hitchcock movie  Rear window  I'm like let her  Let me treat her  Like a regular  Delivery person  God please  Cause I was getting ready  To go  Oh you should have told me  You was a freak  I came down  And got the package  But it's like  You just  I try to treat her  Like hey  You know  Hey  Yeah thanks  Right  Not feeling sorry for  Not asking any extra questions 
[03:23:30]  Like how'd you get here  Little thing now  Did you  You got a special car  Or  Did you fly  Did somebody toss you  Or something  Just like hey thanks  And slam the door  Like if it was a Mexican  But it's like  That thing  I think  Keeps women  From being hilarious  All the time  Is  Just to be able to laugh  At that  Situation right there  Like look at this  It's rare  You're rarely gonna see  A woman that'll  Find the humor in that  Yeah  I think you're right  Hey can I interrupt you  Because  Anthony brought this up  Stardust has 
[03:24:00]  Oh they just  Yeah  But basically  For the first time  We're bringing dust  From the outer space  Into our environment  Well  That's probably a good thing  It was a probe  And Anthony makes a great point  A probe from  A few years ago  They went up  They sent it through  The tail of a comet  And it collected  On this tennis rack  It's size  Little probe  That came off  Of the probe  It collected dust  And all kinds  Of whatever  That's coming off  Of this comet  Then it folds it  Back in  And returns to earth 
[03:24:30]  You know  After it's  Fucking billion mile  Journey  Just yesterday  It came down  Into the desert  In a completely  Sealed canister  Full of galaxy aids  Full of  Exactly  Full of  Who the fuck  Knows what  Look I love  The space program  I love space  Exploration  All this fun stuff  That goes along with it  Yeah I hope these scientists  Didn't sleep in class  Too much  I know  But  They're that confident  That there's no problems 
[03:25:00]  Yeah this is something  They have no clue  What it's about  Or what it is  They just know  It's comet dust  It's some of the shit  They're saying  These flakes  And little particles  Are older than  Our own sun  They're ancient  Right  Like they don't know  What it is  Coming off of this  It's a piece of jelly  Somebody touches it  It's him  Goes off your arm  Before you know it  It's squeezing out  Movie theater  You gotta freeze it  And they bring it down  They did something 
[03:25:30]  A few months back  Or maybe a year ago  Where they collected  Some dust  Off of something else  Like some solar particles  And that one crashed  In the desert  Without its parachute  And broke open  They're still trying  To figure out  If they could salvage  That because it was  Contaminated  This one  Fully sealed  They're gonna bring it  Into a clean room  And work on it  And see what the fuck  It's all about  Without any  Any shit  Contaminating it  From earth  Look at nervous  Ass H.G. 
[03:26:00]  Kumi  This motherfucker  Is so nervous  About evil things  Coming from the planet  Dude  That comet  Is made up  Of the same shit  That this  The fucking  Cement  Is made  It's nothing evil  Out there  In outer space  There's a reason  Anthony brought up  A good point  There's a reason  That things  There's a reason  There's an atmosphere  Around this planet  And it burns shit up  Before it comes in  It might be the same shit  But we're protecting  Now we protected  We gave  We're a pedacellia  Motherfucker  It could have been 
[03:26:30]  Any kind of organism  Or life form  That if it was  Hitching a ride  On a meteor  Would have been  Barbecued  On the way in  And just a vacant  Void rock  Would have been  Sitting somewhere  In the desert  For some hillbilly  To fucking sell  At some UFO show  In Roswell  But now  We gave this thing  A fucking  Protective shield  Brought it through  The atmosphere  That is there  To kill  Any of this  Fucking shit  This is it  And we brought it here 
[03:27:00]  We gave it  A fucking spaceship  And who's going to  Watch this dust  For the rest of time  Now it's got to be  Watched forever  Forever  And it's got to be  Kept in a clean room  Forever  Just in case  And what if you don't  Pay the rent  On the storage facility  Yeah  What if the power  Goes out  Right  What if the room  Cracks open  And it gets into the vent  That's right  You just don't  And I'm saying  Just a couple of  Furry trees  Will be walking around  You're probably right  You don't need to know  It's probably just  Cement dust  Like you said  I say  Can it be any worse  Than nuclear fallout  And all that goofy shit  We got now 
[03:27:30]  That's all the shit  We don't need to know  Everything  Just leave  We don't need to know  How about you  Gather it up  And then you study it  Like up there  You leave it up there  You have some kind of  Robotic arm thing  That goes  Because then we'll have  The fantastic four  Is that what we're  Coming for  Stone man  And flame guy  And invisible bitch  I can't  Don't you beat up  Anthony  I've heard your stupid  Theories with the weather  And stuff  Well look  I'm not  You got some paranoia  That's legitimate  Can fuck the earth
