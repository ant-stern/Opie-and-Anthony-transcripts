<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with commercials for hair loss treatments, Lexus cars, and other products, before launching into a vulgar and nonsensical exchange between the hosts.  They boasted about their high ratings in Philadelphia, receiving corroborating demographic data from a call with Tim Sabian.  This segued into a discussion about a raucous beach party they'd thrown in Buffalo, NY, involving strippers, excessive alcohol, and the use of a zucchini as a “foreign object,” recounted with numerous offensive jokes.  Calls from listeners in Philadelphia and Buffalo followed, with one caller, Joe, mentioning his landlord's displeasure regarding the party’s location.  A brief discussion of the show's "WOW Contest" and a Lenny Kravitz concert ticket giveaway also occurred, interrupted by computer system issues.

A heated argument then erupted between the hosts and Ken (presumably a manager or executive) regarding complaints, implied gag orders, and perceived threats to Jim Norton's job.  The hosts angrily countered with promotional materials contradicting these restrictions, employing extremely vulgar language throughout the confrontation.  More commercials, including ads for sexual lubricants and various other products, aired before promotional segments for an upcoming "pre-20 party" at their studio, featuring the Crystal Method as the musical guest.  The rules of “musical dildo chairs” were discussed, and a frequent caller was invited.  The segment concluded with more commercials and vulgar banter.

The show continued with more commercials interspersed with discussions mainly centered around the Crystal Method party.  The hosts took calls from women interested in attending, engaging in highly detailed and vulgar discussions about their physical attributes (height, weight, breast size, etc.).  A significant portion focused on the perceived leniency in the legal proceedings against Zacarias Moussaoui, prompting a heated commentary on the national mood after 9/11.  Callers, including an EMT and a city cop, shared their opinions, using offensive language and graphic descriptions. Jim Norton clashed with a caller, Irene, who threatened to send him a cancerous breast.  Other callers shared personal anecdotes, with the hosts consistently using offensive language and making crude jokes.  A caller, Benji, criticized the hosts for mocking people with lisps.


The selection process for female guests at the Crystal Method party dominated the next segment. Numerous calls were screened, with the hosts intensely scrutinizing potential attendees’ physical attributes (height, weight, breast size, hair length, shoe size), sexual availability, and “party vibe,” often rejecting callers with blunt and sexually suggestive comments.  A prolonged, contentious exchange with Irene occurred, along with a call from Krista, who was initially rejected but offered to come to the studio for reevaluation. Ken from the Crystal Method called to confirm party details.  A running gag involved attempts to get their boss, Ken Stevens, to hug Anthony.  The segment concluded before the gag’s resolution.

A call with Irene, known for her angry, foul-mouthed tirades, followed. This call centered on her boyfriend's death in their bathroom, which she witnessed after initially ignoring him.  The conversation was filled with sexually explicit and vulgar language from both Irene and the hosts, who made crude jokes.  The hosts also discussed a “pajama party,” using highly suggestive language.  Scotty Crane, Bob Crane's son, called to discuss the film *Autofocus*, detailing his ejection from a screening and his strained relationship with his half-brother. He discussed his father’s collection of sexually explicit materials. Jennifer, the sister-in-law of Irene’s deceased boyfriend, called to express distress.  Chachi promoted a listener contest, and Andrew W.K. was in studio.


The final segment featured more commercials and Andrew W.K. as a guest.  The focus remained on the Crystal Method party, with Opie outlining incredibly specific and stringent criteria for female guests, prohibiting former models and detailing requirements regarding height, menstrual cycle, and hair style.  This led to humorous exchanges. A caller, Jennifer, was interviewed and deemed acceptable. A large Heineken bottle, brought in by a listener, was shown.  The hosts prepared to attend Ben's birthday party with DJ Liquid Todd, and planned Andrew W.K.'s return.  Discussions about techno music and Andrew W.K.’s upcoming Ozfest performance ensued.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Spend thousands on prescription drugs or risk the side effects they cause.  But I heard this commercial for Avacor, and I realized Avacor had found the root of hair loss problems.  The problem is DHT, this bad body chemical that's the culprit in most hair loss.  And liquid Avacor deep cleans the scalp.  Avacor all-natural DHT blocker keeps that DHT from reaching the hair follicles.  It stopped my hair loss.  I began to see results in a few weeks.  People were asking me, hey, what did you do to yourself?  You look thinner, younger.  Avacor is safe for men and women.  There are no harmful side effects. 
[00:00:30]  It's effective for virtually everyone.  So do what thousands of others have done.  Call toll-free.  Get your Avacor risk-free trial now.  Call 888-305-1946.  888-305-1946.  Grow your hair back today.  Call 888-305-1946.  Call now.  Virtually all cars on the road come from an assembly line.  The problem is that so many look and perform as if they came from the same assembly line. 
[00:01:00]  You can blame mass marketing for that.  Which leaves slim pickings for the driver who seeks personal transportation that's truly personal.  Fortunately, there is Lexus.  A company that makes cars like the IS, shaped by lines and details bold enough to suit the most adventurous taste.  Such as drilled aluminum foot pedals, chronograph-style instruments, a muscular inline-six engine, VVTi technology to maximize torque, and an electronic throttle control system with intelligence for lightning fast response.  The Lexus IS, definitely not for the masses. 
[00:01:30]  Starting at $29,980.  The Lexus IS, totally unexpected.  See your New York, New Jersey, Connecticut Lexus dealer.  Or visit Lexus.com.  MSRP including delivery, processing, and handling fee excludes taxes, title license, and optional equipment.  Actual dealer price may vary.  Are you ready?  Here they come.  Opie and Anthony.  How you guys doing?  Get down.  Yeah.  I'm tired, y'all. 
[00:02:00]  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  Smoke weed every day.  Oh, DG.  Smoke weed every day.  Get my back.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Would you shut the f**k up?  What the heck are you doing?  No, no, no, you imbecile.  Stop.  Wow, I thought you were a girl.  You're an ass.  What the hell were you thinking? 
[00:02:30]  How you gotta do it?  You stink.  How you gotta do it?  We suck.  How you gotta do it?  Shut up, stupid.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, die.  Those shoe dogs used to carry the mail through wind and thunder, snow and hail.  Had no dogs, they had no slant.  And one thought drove them straight ahead.  Go, man, go.  They mush in Eskimo.  So, go, man, go, man, go, man, go.  I say, Oopie, what did you learn?  Aaaaaah.  Aaaaaah. 
[00:03:00]  Powl heads.  Aaaaaah.  Sand monkeys.  Aaaaaah.  Whatever, I'll do what I want.  Aaaaaah.  Aaaaaah.  That's a winner.  Go. 
[00:03:30]  F yourself.  You stupid faggot.  You like movies about gladiators.  Aaaaaah.  Poof.  Mama, I want skinny.  Aaaaaah.  Nice head, dick.  Aaaaaah.  Mule.  I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  Shut up.  First of all, you remove the condom. 
[00:04:00]  You dumb whoop.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oi.  Oi.  Oi.  Oi.  Oi.  Oi.  Oi.  I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Are we ready to broadcast? 
[00:04:30]  Ready for broadcast.  Aaaaaah.  Gentlemen, take your places.  We're ready for broadcast.  Aaaaaah.  Aaaaaah.  Aaaaaah.  Aaaaaah.  Well, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oi.  Yeah.  A show that a lot of people seem to listen to.  A couple phone numbers to give out in the New York City area. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  The hometown of the O.P. and Anthony program.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, including...  Oh, yeah.  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Philly.  Hello, Philly.  Pretty much our second home.  Man.  You can call us.  866-277-4WOW.  If you're in Philly or outside of New York City, that's the number for you.  866-277-4WOW.  Now, I'm hearing things, Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I really don't know how to read, like, the ratings.  You don't know how to read those things?  Not really.  Those confounded things.  The bosses kind of sit us down, and they tell us we're either more gooder or the same  or less gooder.  And then we go on the air and we tell our listeners we're more gooder.  Right.  That's what we do.  More gooder.  So, to explain the ratings in Philly today, on the phone is one of our pals, Tim Sabian. 
[00:06:00]  Where it's really gooder.  Congratulations.  Once again, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Really gooder.  Really gooder.  Really more gooder.  I mean, to the point where when you have a 29 share in certain demos, I mean, that's  really gooder.  Oh.  Hey, Tim, are you taking us for granted?  Not at all.  You don't sound as excited as you usually are.  Well, you know, when you see him this big, you're in shock.  I mean, it's stunning.  He's shocked. 
[00:06:30]  He was giving numbers that meant nothing to me.  He was saying something like, we're number one men 35 to 64.  Number one in men, 18 plus, 18 to 24, 18 to 34, 18 to 44, number one 18 to 49, number  one 18 to 54, number one 18 to 64, number one in men 25 plus, number one in men 25 to  34, number one in men 25 to 44, number one in men 25 to 49, number one in men 25 to 54, 
[00:07:00]  number one in men 25 to 64, number one in men 35 to 49, and number one in men 35 to 54.  Well, I never even heard that 64 demo.  I guess there's only one thing to say.  What's up, faggots?  Is that good, though?  Man, nice.  I guess we killed in Philly, huh, Terry?  Oh, congratulations.  And seriously, it just keeps building from the time that you guys started to the present. 
[00:07:30]  It just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.  Well, we got to thank Philly.  We have one of those special relationships with Philly.  Yeah.  The greatest listeners in the world.  Our first syndicated market.  And none of the girls F.  And we're getting, what, 29, 30 shares in some demos?  Absolutely.  A 29.7 share.  And the next closest competitor is like a 10 share, a 14 share.  Thank you, Philly, man.  Wow.  I feel like you're taking this for granted, though, Tim. 
[00:08:00]  You're not as excited.  You're not jumping up and down like you used to.  Oh, they've got me working so much that it's hard.  No, seriously, it's just, it's unbelievable.  It really is.  And when you look at it from where it was a year ago to where it is now, the growth is  just substantial.  That's great.  See?  Look at that, Opie.  And how did the rest of the station do?  Very good.  Tim?  Where'd he go?  Tim?  Tim?  He'll call back. 
[00:08:30]  Well, thank you, Philly.  Yes, you really got behind the show.  The ratings come out pretty much every day for the next two weeks.  Yeah.  So far, we're proud to report that we're number one in New York City with the demo, Ant.  The demo.  Yeah.  We were hired to be number one, men, 18 of 49.  Okay?  We would love to be number one overall in New York and Philly and other places, and we're  working on that.  But we were hired to be number one, men, 18 of 49. 
[00:09:00]  New York City?  We're number one.  Right.  We've been number one for three straight years.  I had Jeremy look it up today.  And we've got to add Philly to that list.  We're number one in Philly as well.  Right.  Thank you.  I guess Boston ratings come out tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Oh, God, please help me.  Dude, I need some help here.  Ratings, gods.  Hi, it's me.  Dude, could you please just, like, give me a little boost or something? 
[00:09:30]  I'm out the door.  They're going to kick me out.  We'll have to see about that.  All right.  Yeah, you know what?  We should get to the article.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Kevin.  Tell you about the Buffalo News today.  Well, we got a lot of emails from the Buffalo area.  Yeah.  You made the paper.  It wasn't real good about that.  It wasn't real good. 
[00:10:00]  It sounded, when I read this article, all I thought was, if I wasn't there, I would be  so pissed that I wasn't there.  I wasn't there, man.  I am mad.  Dude, doesn't it sound like a great party?  Yeah.  They write about it?  Hell yeah.  It starts out, shock, shock, beach fiesta becomes beach feet.  Oh, dude, your phone blows, so I'm going to have to go to somebody else.  They got a wacky title and everything.  Yeah.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Your phone blows, too.  What do you got, Joe?  Hey, I'm calling right from right down by Mickey Rats and Captain Kids, man. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  We're going to have our TN with ONA party.  Okay.  But, man, that article, man, you wrote, it does sound like it was a good party.  Of course it does.  Yeah, man.  I wish I could have been there, but, you know, crap happens.  I guess.  But my landlord is actually the guy who owns Captain Kids and Mickey Rats.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, he doesn't talk too well about you guys.  I don't know about that.  Hey, he doesn't say anything good about you.  Maybe in public.  I know, I know, I know. 
[00:11:00]  I heard about him asking you to be back and stuff like that.  I think we made a lot of people a lot of money this past Saturday.  Well, if you made him so much money, why does he still want my rent then?  I don't know.  Thank you, Joe, for being all fun and goofy.  All right.  Yeah, we made the Buffalo paper today, Anthony.  Yes.  Front page of the local section.  Shock, jock, beach fiesta becomes beach fiasco.  Beach fiesta becomes beach fiasco.  Fiasco. 
[00:11:30]  Fiasco.  What is that translated from?  What language is fiasco?  Fiasco.  I'm going to go eat el fiasco.  I think it's more like a Greek thing.  Is it?  It sounds Italian or French.  But that's the obvious choice.  I'm going to say it's...  Suck it, you fiasco.  I think it's Greek.  Yeah?  That's my guess.  Why don't you read this one, Ant?  All right.  Yeah, shock, jock, beach fiesta becomes beach fiasco.  The nightlife along the Lake Erie beaches has always been a little bit wild, but it took 
[00:12:00]  a turn toward Fort Erie standards over the weekend in Angola.  Fort Erie is where all the greatest strip clubs are located, Anthony.  There you go.  You go right over the border, you get to see some stuff.  What was billed as a...  I can't even read it.  Was it billed this way?  What was billed as a sporting contest for women's strippers...  That's great. 
[00:12:30]  ...developed into a rowdy event combining full nudity and lewd acts with foreign objects.  That's a party I want to be at.  I guess they just didn't want to put the word zucchini in print.  Full nudity, lewd acts with foreign objects.  Who doesn't want it with tanned?  No, it was full nudity and lewd acts with zucchini.  Zucchini.  That wasn't foreign.  Everyone knew what it was.  With one large zucchini.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  A four-foot monster of a zucchini.  I saw other things, including bottles, so maybe that was...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, perhaps that's the other foreign objects.  I saw zucchini.  Evans town officials, residents, and even the owner of Captain Kids, Mickey Ratz, were left  wondering this week how they could have prevented Saturday's activities when syndicated shock jocks  Sophie and Anthony brought their road show to the local bar.  How you prevent it?  A volleyball tournament between strippers from Western New York nightclubs was scheduled for 
[00:13:30]  the event, promoted by WBUF FM, Infinity Broadcasting.  Internet photos from the event show widespread nudity, but the activities apparently went far  beyond that.  And this is my best, my favorite quote of the article in the Buffalo News today.  Go ahead.  One woman reported that her twin 10-year-old nieces were at a birthday party nearby on  the beach, which was overwhelmed by the sound of drunken young men shouting lewd comments 
[00:14:00]  at women.  A little birthday party's going on.  You know what?  Happy birthday to...  Short, you can't, you slut!  Oh man, how friggin' funny is that?  You know, we love press like this, but we gotta state for the record, these twin 10-year-old  nieces did not see a thing.  Of course not, that whole area was cleared, we had a perimeter.  Yeah, I was trying to sneak them in and I got stopped. 
[00:14:30]  It was all fenced off and they didn't get, nowhere's near the action, no one did that  didn't want to be there.  Happy birthday to you.  Eat my c***!  Suck my c***!  Happy birthday to...  Stick the bottle in your c***!  Happy birthday to your 10-year-old nieces.  F*** me!  Me!  Hey! 
[00:15:00]  Happy birthday to...  Stick it in her c***!  That's great.  We continue, Evans Police Chief Robert Ferguson said his department is investigating the day's  activities.  Yeah, this story has some lags, because the news stations have reported on it, now the  papers are reporting on this.  But other sources said they haven't heard of anyone being injured.  Well, that's good.  I guess that's a plus. 
[00:15:30]  There were arrests for driving while intoxicated, disorderly conduct, and one report of a driver  leaving the scene of an accident.  An estimated 5,000 tickets were sold to the event.  But Richie Alberts, owner of Captain Kids Mickey Rats, said there may have been more people  because much of the beach itself is beyond the club's control.  And the boats they had out there?  Yeah, it was well over 5,000.  Anything that was on the license premises, we stopped immediately, Albert said. 
[00:16:00]  I had eight Buffalo cops working security.  I did everything that would be expected to do.  Albert adds, this was run by the radio station.  Do you notice, like, something happening here?  Hey!  Hey, don't look at me!  At this point, it's every man for themselves.  Right.  Which is fine.  We were only hosting, but ultimately, the reflection is on us.  Yeah, we were only hosting.  The bar owner said he didn't realize when the show was booked how big Opie and Anthony were. 
[00:16:30]  That's what he said?  Yeah.  And then he says, well, they won't beep this.  This is okay.  I'm just reading the article.  I'm not saying anything bad.  To be scrutinized more closely before I do future events with anybody.  Evan's supervisor, Robert Catalino, said he went to the event at the end of the day after hearing reports that there had been problems. 
[00:17:00]  He said things had quieted down by then.  He got there six and a half hours too late.  Yeah.  He was a former bartender.  Said he had helped 10 bar for a short time to give the bartender friend a chance to eat.  The event was already over by then.  The bar may face some repercussions from the event, Catalino said.  They know some of the things that happened I won't put up with and neither will the town board, he said.  These kind of things won't be tolerated on the beach.  It won't happen. 
[00:17:30]  Catalino said the town board may have to add additional conditions when various town licenses for Captain Kids Mickey Rats come up for a renewal next year.  They're forbidding it from, quote, from even considering anything leading to lewd behavior.  Like the chants.  All those little chants that were going on by the crowd.  Since the event, Opie and Anthony have been saying good things about the Buffalo area on their nationally broadcast show.  They went to Chippewa Street. 
[00:18:00]  They went to restaurants.  And they've been talking about how great Western New York is, said Alberts.  But the local spin isn't helping me too much.  And WB, B-U-F-F-M did not respond to requests for comment.  There you go.  We got some news in the Buffalo paper today.  Doesn't that sound like a great party?  Sounds like a great time.  What did I miss?  I, you know, if you read that and you weren't there, you're going to be pissed you weren't there. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  I'm going to smash this computer.  Why?  I'm just going to smash it.  Why?  Because now it's frozen again.  Pete Johnson.  Well, get Pete Johnson.  What's wrong with it?  Get Pete Johnson.  I'll go to the phone while we get Pete in here.  Lisa, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, where are you calling from, Lisa?  I am calling from Philadelphia.  Oh, cool.  Um, yeah.  How are your ratings with your female demographic?  Who cares? 
[00:19:00]  Well, we obviously want more women listening to us, but, you know, we're a little harsh at times.  Dude, I think you guys are fine.  We do well overall, though.  All those women, you know, they're bitches and, you know, they just whine and complain, you know.  You know, it really sucks for those cool girls out there that, you know, enjoy a little debauchery here and there.  Look at that.  Some crude language and, you know, stuff like that.  We do all right with the women.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you do have a strong following down here and I listen to you guys every day. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  You guys are hilarious.  Thank you, Lisa.  Love you, Jimmy.  Bye, ma'am.  Bye.  All right.  Pete Johnson's in the studio.  Pete, Anthony's having a big problem with his computer and he wants to smash it.  Pete, it's working now, right?  Pete, but then eventually the mouse, the little icon there will stop moving and the whole thing will freeze up.  I've had this happen before.  Try kicking it in the corner?  Kick it.  I'll give that a try if it freezes again.  Thank you, Pete.  Kick it. 
[00:20:00]  Kick it.  Pete doesn't know.  He's not the computer guy.  The computer guy isn't here.  He really doesn't know.  Scott's the computer guy.  Yeah, speaking of computer guy, he's on vacation.  He's in a state of panic.  He came into work today because he heard us talking about him being on vacation.  Yeah.  He discovered there's between 50 and 100 new contestants in the WOW Contest.  Wow.  And he goes, it's going to be really tough to get them all up on Monday when I get back into work.  Damn.  But there's like 50 to 100 more women to check out in this WOW Contest. 
[00:20:30]  More to throw out.  And tomorrow is officially the last day to qualify to be in the WOW Contest.  Yeah.  Go to opandanthony.com for all the rules and what you need to do if you want in on this contest.  So when are we going to be able to put up those girls?  He's going to do them as soon as he gets back on Monday.  All right.  But it's going to take them probably over a day.  He'll have some up on Monday, but he's not going to have all of them.  So, all right.  I want to see some of the beauties that are coming.  All right.  We're just warming up.  We'll take a quick break here, Anthony.  I want to thank Philly for giving us huge ratings once again. 
[00:21:00]  Man, Philly.  Thank you.  So, and also, Buffalo, what's up?  Good press.  Yeah.  Good press today.  Good press.  All right.  Yeah.

My sister Trudy never saw him.  Ma, I only go to Blockbuster once a week.  I drop off my old games, I get new ones, and keeping them a week lets me perfect them.

[00:31:00]  That's the name of a bitch.  Oh, that's the name of a bitch.  Ah.  That's the name of a bitch.  More getting crapped on.  Ah.  That's what it is.  Yo.  Yo, yo, yo.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The better we do, the more we get crapped on.  That's the bottom line.  People crying.  We can't talk about this, that, the other thing. 
[00:31:30]  Insinuating that we put gag orders on people.  Eat me!  We love handling things on the air.  We want to talk about things.  And Ken's now threatening the air staff of being fired.  Is that it?  If things are said that have nothing to do with anybody, has it gotten that sensitive of  a situation, Ken, that now you can't even say certain things like, love you, O.B., love 
[00:32:00]  you, Jim.  It's that friggin' ridiculous now?  It's gotten that stupid?  Because people are pussies and can't fight their own battles?  Or just ignore things or something?  So the better job we do, the better we are, the more crap we have to spoon feed down our  throats?  Is that it?  Why is that? 
[00:32:30]  I'd love an answer to that.  I'd love to know why anti-O&A bumper stickers are being produced, yet we can't talk about  it.  How did that get solved?  I didn't hear how it got solved.  I got a complaint call from the agent that the lawyer's calling, bitching at us about  something, about some veiled, separated by 800 degrees of separation reference that  was made.  Maybe.  Maybe. 
[00:33:00]  But no.  We get threatened.  Suck it, man.  I've had it being crapped on and backed into corners and then being told I agreed to stuff  I never agreed to.  If we're not, and I can't even say who because they'll jump out of it.  If we're not supposed to talk about people, then why are they making stickers and promotions 
[00:33:30]  and all kinds of other things?  Telling, holding court with listeners so the press can pick up on things and print it in  the paper.  That's breaking any agreement that was made in my book.  That's a broken agreement.  Broken agreement, Ken.  We have enough problems trying to do this show with the FCC limitations. 
[00:34:00]  Now there's just ridiculous rules.  There you go.  Stickers now available there.  And the argument is, well, it's not their site.  Yeah, well, they're the ones that came up with the idea on the air.  F-O-N-A.  Wow.  Oh.  There's a clever one.  So what was done about that? 
[00:34:30]  We're not getting backed into a corner again.  You already cut our nuts off when that first battle on the air went on.  And when we came back, we were told, oh, it's taken care of, so don't say anything.  Oh, it's taken care of.  Don't worry.  They're gone.  Everything's fine.  And then we come back.  And more crap gets set.  But we're just supposed to shut up because Ken's taking care of it. 
[00:35:00]  No.  No.  And I'm hearing that Jim Norton's job was just threatened.  Yeah, that's what got me all pissed off.  Ken's now telling Jim or anyone else on this show, you know, saying something like,  I love your hope, love your aunt.  You can't say that.  Because separated by 800 degrees of separation, it might be a veiled reference. 
[00:35:30]  Can Big Kev maybe get us an interview with Don Knotts?  Or would that not be right?  Is that too close?  Pool?  Is it?  My God.  The latest one, I had Sandy on the air yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I stated that I hate girlfriends and wives that are on radio shows.  Right.  Next thing you know, someone thinks we're talking about them.  Right.  No ass.  I can name three or four shows in New York alone that have their stupid girlfriends and 
[00:36:00]  wives on the air on a daily basis.  So shut your trap.  No.  No.  I was stating an opinion.  I hate girlfriends and wives on radio shows.  So Sandy said what she had to say.  And I said, ugh, fine.  I got my job to do.  And as far as Ken's concerned, we moved on.  We moved on, what, a month ago?  Whatever it was that we no longer had to listen here in New York. 
[00:36:30]  We moved on a month ago.  We were doing just fine and dandy.  And then some sticker promotion comes out that I had to call you up and tell you about.  You didn't even know about it.  And then I just hear, oh, it's been taken care of.  Well, it's out there.  Oh, we shut the barn door after those horses got out.  Don't worry.  Oh, they're no freaks.  So we sit there and what, take it?  No. 
[00:37:00]  We don't sit and take anything.  Never have, never will.  And they will not be firing Jim Norton.  No.  Tell us you love us whenever you like, Jimmy.  That's fine.  They'll reference my ass.  Stop it already.  And I don't want to hear from another effing lawyer.  I've had my fill of those sea-sucking pigs.  They should all croak.  Goddamn, please.  If there has to be another terrorist event, do it during a lawyer convention. 
[00:37:30]  Just blow that building up and kill them all.  They all suck.  They're vultures.  They're two-faced sea-suckers.  And I don't want to hear from another one of them.  I don't care.  Don't call me.  I don't have Bobby to tell me.  I got a call from Steve Lehrman, the lawyer over at Infinity.  I don't care.  He's a little upset that you guys said a word that rhymed with Ike. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Shoot me.  Calm the F down.  I'm talking to myself.  And it's a dick move to tell Jim that he might get fired.  Oh, stop it.  You think you got problems now.  You fired Jim Norton.  Watch.  Watch what happens.  Watch what happens.  You think we sit and smile at you as Norton goes out the door and just go on the next day and do our show? 
[00:38:30]  What do we look like?  Rock Hole?  Well, unlike Rock Hole, we're not going to just sit here and go, well, Jimmy, sorry.  Boss says you can't play with us anymore.  Hey, we're making too much money, so go F yourself.  We'll see you at the comedy clubs around town.  No, you will not be getting fired.  Trust me, Jim.  We haven't been talking about certain people, Ken, because it's a non-issue.  It's a non-issue.  The veiled references, you're hallucinating.  And as far as mentioning things that are happening on another show as far as bashing us, yeah, that's what we do. 
[00:39:00]  I heard it was taken care of.  I don't know.  I'm seeing these things available a little too late to have been taken care of.  Perhaps if it was taken care of the first time it was aired and you were paying attention and then went in and dealt with it, perhaps then it would be taken care of.  Now it's too late to be taken care of, which, you know something, by me, fine, I don't care. 
[00:39:30]  But as far as these dopey-ass, pussy, grammar school playground rules that these sea-sucking lawyers make, I see it as deals off.  Off.  It's obvious that some of the people out there can't play with the big boys.  It hasn't been taken care of.  So, there you go.  Don't let no freaks.  Say what you want. 
[00:40:00]  If a wife or a girlfriend calls this show and it sucks, you could say, God, that sucks when a wife or a girlfriend calls the show.  I've been saying that for years.  Of course.  That's why you don't hear our girlfriends and wives on this show.  Is anyone married around here lately?  Oh, Rick.  I've been saying that for years.  You could say, love you, Jim.  Love you, O.  That's fine. 
[00:40:30]  I could say, bowling sucks.  That's fine.  Because it does.  Enough.  I'm not going to sit here and take and be fed a baby spoon full of diarrhea.  By the likes of them, or lawyers, enough already. 
[00:41:00]  It's baby crap.  Got it?  Jesus.  Yeah, pay attention, Ken.  We're not having rallies and addressing, holding court to a dozen people.  And bitching so it ends up in the newspaper. 
[00:41:30]  That hasn't been us, Ken.  The little bargain we never agreed to, we've been holding to anyway.  Your problem lies a little south of here.  Not here.  We're not making F-O-N-A stickers, Ken. 
[00:42:00]  We're not the ones doing that.  Which look exactly like the WOW stickers.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice font.  Calling all freaks.  The same as the WOW sticker.  So why then are we, once again, put in the position that we're the A-holes.  And we're the bad guys.  And Ken has to go off to Jim Norton and put limitations.  To placate them?  Bull. 
[00:42:30]  Bull.  I wish I could curse right now.  I would string together about eight.  No.  No.  Got it?  No.  Talk about whatever you want.  We all straight?  There you go.  There.  Take this on Ken's office door.  Has he seen this?  Yes.  Throw these stickers at him.  All right? 
[00:43:00]  There you go.  We don't lay down for people.  We don't tuck our tail between our legs and run away.  And we don't make these stupid deals that the lawyers came up with.  The lawyers know nothing about entertaining radio.  Or having fun.  Or anything.  Satisfying a woman.  Nothing. 
[00:43:30]  You want to pat the guy on the back?  And the guy that's holding court and just lying to everybody that he gets the chance to whine to?  That's fine.  As they're, you know, putting out stickers and talking.  We can, you know, oh, perish the thought.  You say, I love you, Jim.  Oh, perish the thought. 
[00:44:00]  Don't talk about bowling.  All right?  Talk about whatever you want.  There you go.  Why is it that when it's supposed to be a happy day, it always turns into a sad day?  We just got killer ratings in Philly.  It's ridiculous.  And instead of being patted on the back and maybe taken out to lunch or whatever, we're getting yelled and screamed at. 
[00:44:30]  And our buddy Jim Norton is being threatened with a firing.  Yeah.  How does this make sense?  Yeah.  Good job.  We just gave Ken killer ratings in Philly.  Yeah.  This is what we get in return.  And in New York.  And in New York.  And in New York.  All right.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, wow.  Crystal Method playing, Anthony.  Name of the game. 
[00:45:00]  Crystal Method will be the house band on the Opie and Anthony show this coming Tuesday.  And we want to do something special.  Yes, we do.  We want a lot of ladies to come on down to the station.  Yes.  And I don't know.  Little, little skippy halter tops.  I think we want to have some kind of a, like a little negligee type party or a pajama party type atmosphere.  Yes.  You know?  All day long, they're going to be spinning live on our show, Crystal Method, this coming Tuesday. 
[00:45:30]  Is this a pre-20 party?  Well, we're not allowed to say teen anymore, so.  Pre-20.  We're looking for girls 20 and below.  But, you know, if you fit the bill and you're just into your 20s, that's fine.  Call up.  That's fine as well.  We're calling it our pre-20 party.  This coming Tuesday.  Right.  Are we going to have an open house policy?  Just come down and watch Crystal Method spin if you're a hot chick? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  But if girls want to call us up, though, and tell us they're coming down, we can talk to them a little bit.  If you want to come down, hang out, little party, Crystal Method spinning, and we're going to set it up.  We'll have a nice party atmosphere.  That'd be great.  We should get some beds so the girls can jump on the beds, have pillow fights.  And, guys, stay home.  Yeah.  We want the pack of girls to show up.  We're going to get calls from all the guys we know. 
[00:46:30]  Dude, can I show up, please?  Stay home.  Maybe we can...  How cool would it be to do musical dildo chairs with Crystal Method spinning?  Yeah.  Maybe we could do that.  We got a good prize we could give away?  We haven't played musical dildo chairs in a while.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll have something cool to give away.  Some of the girls can play musical dildo chairs.  All right.  Well, that's how you get into the party.  First of all, you've got to call in and tell us you want in on the musical dildo chair game.  Okay?  Yes. 
[00:47:00]  And then we'll go from there.  Basically, it's just like musical chairs, Anthony.  But all the girls start with a chair.  But there'll be something on the chair.  Something a little different.  There's a chair and a fake member on the chair.  But there's one less chair than people.  And they've got to fight over it.  And they've all got to sit down.  And I mean sit.  And then the girl that isn't sitting properly is removed.  And then another chair and rubber member is removed. 
[00:47:30]  Why is Frenchie losing their mind?  What is up, Malk?  I can see those stupid girls.  Oh, look at the fake series.  Sit on it, you all.  Sit.  All right.  All right.  We've done this before.  We've had a lot of success with the musical dildo chairs.  It's about the French Fonzie.  Hey, Cunningham, put that in my mouth. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, Emma, what's going on?  Hi.  Remember me from last summer?  No, no, no.  You don't remember the girl with one leg?  I came in and took my leg off and hopped around for you.  Oh, yeah.  What's up, Emma?  Not much.  How are you doing?  Good.  You want to come in?  I do want to come in.  I don't know about the musical dildo chairs.  But I will come in in a skimpy outfit.  Oh, that's good enough.  You've got one leg.  You're invited to the Crystal Method party this coming Tuesday.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Yeah, you were in the New York Magazine article.  I was.  I had a lot of friends from high school calling me up and saying, like, they didn't even put 
[00:48:30]  my last name.  They thought Emma with one leg, and they were like, oh, it's got to be you.  Well, duh.  How many people with one leg that are named Emma?  Nobody.  I don't even know any girls with one leg.  All right.  You're invited to the party on Tuesday when Crystal Method spins all day long, okay?  Awesome.  I'm psyched.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I'll definitely do that.  We need to throw a little party.  Yes.  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Hold on, Emma.  All right.  Cool.  You think she'd play if we couldn't get the dildos, but we had Morris Lindenbaum from  Long Island sitting there? 
[00:49:00]  Guy's my idol.  Oh, is that the...  What a classic.  Look at his face.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's...  I want to hug him.  Just peck his little cheeks.  He gave his wife AIDS.  The gift that keeps on giving.  She was 64 and he was 50, right?  Oh, he's just a classic.  What an ass.  AIDS.  He looks like Nick Nolte.  He's just great.  The wife makes a good point, though.  He's getting out of jail or whatever after serving, what, five months or something? 
[00:49:30]  And she's saying, well, I got a life sentence.  He gets out in five months.  Oh, how old abroad is she?  How old is she?  I think she's like 64.  Yeah, stop it.  Yeah.  You'll be fine.  Yeah, she's got a seven-year sentence, eight years tops.  Right.  All right.  I don't think you're going to be around too much longer anyway.  That stinks when you're in your 60s to run around with AIDS.  I mean, that's a young man's disease.  You know, your 60s, your health is going bad enough.  Young gay man's disease.  Yeah.  That's a below between 24th and 40th Street.  Why did her husband give her the AIDS?  Was there a reason for it? 
[00:50:00]  Maybe supper was cold.  He's just pissed off.  And he didn't.  I thought when I read it that he maybe did that old syringe trick or a little blood transfer.  Just had some unprotected sex with him.  He didn't like bags.  Good boy.  A little, uh, and that was that.  Hiv injection.  Oh, boy.  I guess we better, uh, take a break.  Nah.  Someone's been poking their head.  Oh, stop it.  I swear to God.  I don't want to hear anything.  I don't want to hear it.  Shaking his head.  Keep shaking it.  Once again, we're the bad guys. 
[00:50:30]  We're the bad guys.  Keep shaking it.  We did nothing wrong.  Absolutely nothing.  Uh, you want to play that Stephen Lynch song or what?  You're finding it?  You'll get it in time?  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City.  Uh, 866-2774.  Wow.  So we're putting together this Crystal Method party for Tuesday.  Okay?  I want the girls to call up.  Emma's in because you got the one leg. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Got us.  I guess you got to give us a reason why you should be invited to the Crystal Method party.  Really?  Hotness helps.  It's not going to take much of a reason, girls.  No, no, no.  Hotness helps.  Yeah.  They call in.  They're like, I'm 5'1", 200 pounds.  You know.  Yuck.  She wants to wear a little, little number.  Something a little.  Maybe she can come in if she lets us punch her in between breaks.  So give us a call if you want in.  All right?  Roy.  What a weird day this has become, huh, kids?  Bah.  What a strange day. 
[00:51:30]  We're all in the back office laughing and enjoying the success of our radio show.  Yeah.  And once again, we're getting slapped in the face.  We're doing absolutely nothing wrong.  There you go.  Beautiful.  All right.  You guys can't find it.  I can tell.  All right.  We'll play it later, I guess.  Oh, look at them.  They're just pawing through stuff.  Digging through CDs and carts and no organization as far as those CDs go.  We're going to take a break, regroup, and continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Featuring our pal Jim Norton.

No  Irene  Yeah  What's up?  I want to go to the party  Because I think I'd be a lot of fun 
[01:02:30]  I'm like about 18  And what's more  I have a crush on your little producer, Jim Norton  You know when that girl Irene called  About a month ago  And he said one-titted to her?  Wait  Oh, I got so  Ma'am, ma'am  I was laughing because she's going in for a biopsy  And if I find out that I have cancer  Which I don't mind because I don't want to live  Then I'm going to send a diseased breast to his  I'll whack my bag onto it, you dope  And I'm not the producer 
[01:03:00]  I'm the almost-fired hack comic they have in the studio  Get your information straight, cancer lady  Oh, boy, this is going to be a weird day  It's only going to get stranger, yeah  She cursed a lot, so I don't know what made the air  But basically she, the last time Irene called  You want to explain Irene?  Irene's the lady that  How do you explain her?  She's insane  Well, she was  Picture a C with feet  Irene was the lady that was too busy sleeping  To notice that her loved one, her husband 
[01:03:30]  Was dying in the bathroom  Yeah, yeah  It was like 2 in the morning  I think she laid the whole scene out  And the husband complained that, you know  He wasn't feeling too well or anything  And instead of maybe Irene staying up all night  Making sure her husband's okay or whatever  She went to bed  She went to bed and got a good night's sleep  While her husband died in the bathroom  Can you fix my heart?  I don't feel good 
[01:04:00]  But I think with one of those calls  Jimmy did make reference to the fact that  She might have one boob  Yeah  Oh, well  And so she said  She said that  But she used the T word for boob  And I guess you hit home  Because she does have two  But she's going in for a biopsy  There may be a problem with one of her boobs  And now she's really pissed off  That you said that a couple weeks ago  Too bad  Be a nicer person  It's not my fault  I don't know you  I don't care about you  I don't care if you have a lump 
[01:04:30]  And she also said if one is  Blow your brains out  That's what I would do  She also said if one's cancerous  I'm sorry we have to repeat all this  Because I don't know what the curse is  Cut out here  That she will be mailing  Or sending  The cancerous boob  To you  Jim Norton  Dude  And she said I should eat it  Yeah  And I replied to her  That I would whack my bag on it  How great would that be  And then just yell at it  And fall asleep  And have a heart attack  While it sits there  And does nothing  It would be  Do you realize that  If you sent your severed breast  It would be just as effective 
[01:05:00]  In helping a loved one  As the rest of you is  Oh man  Sit there callously  I love the fact how she called up all nice  I'm Irene  And then by the end of it  She was out of her effing mind  Like we weren't supposed to know it was her  She's a crud  And she does bad impressions of an 18 year old  I want to talk to your producer  Jim Norton  No I  We all knew it was Irene  Dominic what's up  Hey how are you  First time caller  I love you guys  Thanks Dominic  No I woke up in the middle of the night  One night  And I had chest pains  And I sat up at the end of the bed 
[01:05:30]  Sweating  Had chest pains and everything  Tried to wake up my wife  And I told her  I gotta go to the hospital  And she said okay  So I got in my car  And I drove myself  You drove yourself  She wouldn't drive you  Why didn't she drive you  She was sleeping  Well we got three kids too  So it was either that  Wake up somebody down the street  Or my neighbor or something  Or just drive myself  I drove myself  I spent a lonely night in the hospital  By myself  Wow  Did you  Did you bitch at your wife  No I didn't bitch  I'm a man 
[01:06:00]  I don't bitch  Alright  Sounds like you got  Quite the loving spouse  Yeah  She is the loving spouse  But that's my story  And I'm sticking to it  Thank you  I'm just hoping  Irene calls back  You only gave us a little bit today  With her lump  We love when  Irene calls this show  She is a lump  What's wrong?  Just this  This day is gonna be bad  Pedophiles  The world just sucks 
[01:06:30]  It's just a gross  Awful place  Oh well  They'll catch him  And you know  He'll plead insanity  Or something  And get off the hook  Some dummy will say  Well he's really thick  You know  You have to give him a  Hadn't even been a year yet  And we're just letting  These terrorists  Plead guilty  And get off the hook  You hear that now  That Massawi guy  He was supposed to be  On one of those planes  By the way  Supposed to be  On one of those planes  And he's now  They're talking about  His sanity  He might not be 
[01:07:00]  Seen enough  To stand trial  And now he says  He wants to plead guilty  And the judge goes  Well you think about it  We'll give you another week  Let him plead guilty  And I know  This will never happen  But execute him  The guy will get  A few years in prison  And prison's probably  A better life  Than he was leading anyway  I don't understand  Why we lose  The balls so quickly  Remember  Last  September  Hello  Anyone remember  What happened  No one seems to have 
[01:07:30]  That real  Spark anymore  Like they want this  Taken care of  And solved  And not happen again  And anyone responsible  Should be  Remember  I was saying  You know that  Mohammed Atta  Guy  We should break out  All the tapes  Because people  Were just losing  Their minds  Right after September 11  You make a good point  They forgot  Yeah  You know Mohammed Atta  His face on the  Cover of all the papers  And you're like  Everyone  Looked at that picture  And said  If I had that guy  Here right now  God what we would  Do to him  And you know  Kill him  If he was 
[01:08:00]  You know  If you were able  To get him  And he wasn't dead  Just think of what  We could do with him  If he even stood trial  Or something  That's what this  Other guy is  He was supposed to be  One of those guys  There's no doubt about it  But for some reason  Now everyone's just like  Alright  They're letting him  Make all these  Motions in court  They're letting him  Make these ridiculous  Motions  That just  Prolong the trial  And no one's  Doing anything about it  They just sit back  And everyone forgets  And we look at the  Flags on the side  Of the road 
[01:08:30]  And the gutters  There's barely any  Flags on vehicles  Now anyway  And everyone just  Kind of goes along  Their life now  And these people  Are still out there  Doing stuff  But we're like  Eh  Alright  Forget it  And then when it  Happens again  We'll all get all  Oh bring the flags  Back out  Kill kill kill  Let's all light our  Candles for a week  Yeah  And it will happen again  Alright of course it will  Alright a week's good enough  I'm busy  I gotta get back  To my regular life  Next time it'll be  A nuke  The city will be a nuke  It will happen again 
[01:09:00]  And again  And again  And you know what the judge  Is afraid of  She's afraid  Rick raised a good point  She's afraid of having  Her decision overturned  You know  On appeal or whatever  Well he didn't know  What he was doing  And you shouldn't have  Let him  You should have  Looked out for his sanity  And she's just looking out  It's a matter of  Covering your own ass  And another real kicker  On this whole subject  Is one of the leaders  Of the Black Panthers  Is now going to the court  With supporters  To make sure  Moussaoui gets a fair shake 
[01:09:30]  Make sure everything goes okay  Because he's being railroaded  He's having a hard time  Being incarcerated  I think the victims  Had a hard time  Realizing they were  Trapped on the 90th floor  And they weren't  Getting out  How about that  They weren't lucky enough  To die right away  Put him in a huge building  Start a fire  On all the floors  Below him  And let's see how  He deals with it  You know  No one remembered  Does anyone remember  This happened  Remember how some  Of the victims  Jumped because it was 
[01:10:00]  Better than being  Burnt alive  Does anyone remember  This  I think those people  Were having a tough time  Dealing with the situation  That they were handed  Because I don't understand  Why we're being  So nice to these people  Because a lot of people  See it  As the time has gone on  They see it as an attack  On white corporate America  And not the entire country  So they feel safe  And going well  Let's see if this guy  Gets a fair shake  Because they don't feel  Like they were personally hit  Yeah we were all united  There for a second  Ridiculous  And now it's turned into  Yeah  Alright well that attack 
[01:10:30]  Was on  You know  America  Supporting Israel  Or capitalism  Or yeah  Corporate America  And now everyone's  Divvying back up again  Into these  Little separate  Pockets of  Black and white  And Muslim  And Christian  And  The bottom line is  Lots of people died  We know  We know who  Did it  We know other people  That were involved  With it  Unfortunately  This son of a bitch  Was in jail  At the time  Which should have been  A little  Hello 
[01:11:00]  The guy's taking  Flying lessons  And you put him in jail  Because his visa  Isn't straightened out  How about you talk to him  As to why he's taking  Flying lessons  But  Why are they being  Treated so nicely  Because of  There's an element  In this country  That is an arrogant  Liberal element  That is guilty  And is very afraid  Of being considered  Racist  Or politically incorrect  So you have to  Handle this with  Kid gloves  Or people might see  What a scumbag  You really are  Brian what's going on  Hello gentlemen  Hey  How you doing 
[01:11:30]  Alright  I'm an EMT  I was there for the  First three days  After this happened  And I think  They should give them  To us  Give us 20 minutes  And we'll own a room  With them  I can think of  A lot of my friends  That were there  Had to deal with  All this problem  Like you were talking  About watching the people  Jump out of the buildings  And all that stuff  And I mean  At least us  We're never going to  Forget what happened  Because we were  I mean  No more than anybody  Else that should  But  Norton was right  There's too many people  Trying to make  Too many points  And say 
[01:12:00]  Well we can be liberal  And we can be  Forgiving and kind  And there's a lot of us  Start that way  So I think we should  Give them to him  Alright Brian  Thank you  Take care  Again you know  They're using  The race card  Which always comes up  It's true  They're using the race card  When the Black Panthers  Get involved  Now  There's a whole  Thing about  Alright  We don't want to  Upset this segment  Of society  So let's kind of  Twist around  The way we handle  The case  The case should be  Handled  Based on the facts  And everything else  The way it's 
[01:12:30]  Supposed to work  Not based on  Who are we going to  Offend  Whose religious rights  Are going to be  Stepped on  If we do this  With this guy  Or that  The guy is a  An animal  Criminal  That has no business  Being alive  And being fed  On tax dollars  We're feeding the guy  We're clothing him  We're giving him  Heat and television  And whatever else  He gets  Where he's being held  We should handle it  Like they would  One thing I'll say  About the Middle East  Is as much as I dislike  A lot of their 
[01:13:00]  Beliefs or policies  They do handle  Convicted criminals  The right way  An Iranian rapist  Is being thrown  Off a cliff  In a sack  That is what  Should happen  To a rapist  Is that what  They  Not only  Are they throwing him  Off a cliff  They're putting him  In a sack first  So he can't even  My legs will be  Kicking and  Hitting in the old  Cartoon sack  So he can't even  Feel like he has  A chance  That's right  You just gotta hope  The sack lands  Because if you're  Thrown off a cliff  At least you're gonna  Like  You know  Go through the motions 
[01:13:30]  Try to stop yourself  Maybe I'll be the first  Guy that flies  Maybe he'll grab a rock  And not go all the way down  They put you in a sack  That's brilliant  Throw him off a cliff  In a sack  And you know what  People see that and go  Oof  I better not commit a rape  That's a punishment  Right  Dave what's going on  What's up guys  Hey  I'm a city cop  Yeah  And I was there from day one  Right till the end  When I closed the site  Yeah  And I worked down that area  For a while  Now  People just forget  What happened  Like people just  Associated with TV  And movies  They really don't 
[01:14:00]  Understand what happened  We need to be the sake  Of lynch mobs  Start like taking people out  They absolutely forget  People have forgotten  Everyone was so weepy  And touched  And united  And then  We're not even  At the one year mark  God bless America  You sons of bitches  We need to be bloodbusters  We're not even  At the one year mark  And  People are fine with it  There's no outrage  There's no  Where are the protests  In front of the court  That this guy's being tried at 
[01:14:30]  People are scared  Where's the outrage  And protest  And marching  And all that  Where John Walker  It gets  Maximum of 20 years  In prison  Where's the justice in that  People are scared  To be called  You know  Like  They're so afraid  Supporting the regime  They don't want to be called racers  Supporting the regime  That planned those attacks  He would  Picked up guns  To defend the people  That want us dead  Yeah 
[01:15:00]  People are  People are terrified  And he gets  Maximum of 20 years  Where's the outrage  And there's no outrage  It was on the paper  And everyone's like  Oh jeez  Great  Okay  People don't realize  That's actually going on  He gets a maximum  Of 20  And Justin Volpe  Gets a maximum  Of 30  For attacking  The millionaire  Admiral Lelima  The healthy  Robust  Admiral Lelima  You're a rip off  Harder  Money will be gone  Soon  Alright Dave 
[01:15:30]  Thank you  And I gotta say  About this Iranian thing  This could be the greatest  Thing I've ever heard  After they throw him  Off a cliff in the sack  If the unnamed man  Survives the fall  Down a rocky precipice  Oh he's allowed to walk  Right  No  He will be hanged  Oh wow  Cause some of these  Sick crime  Sick punishments  They do  If you survive it  They  You go free  How great  But not in this case  They hang you  If you survive the fall  Imagine like  Boom  You do that last roll  And you go  Oh my god 
[01:16:00]  I'm still alive  Look at me  I made it  And you know  They pull him right out  Of the bag  And string him up  There's no back  To the  The jailhouse  For the appeal  They pull you  Out of the bag  They probably keep you  In the bag  Pull your head out  Put the news on it  And hang you  A rocky precipice  A precipice  That's great  Well maybe when the  One year mark hits  And all the news stations  Try to get the  Huge ratings  By replaying 
[01:16:30]  Exactly what happened  That day  Maybe people  Start remembering  But I don't think so  I think it'll be more  Nostalgia  Like watching an episode  Of Happy Days  Or something  You know  No one really gets  That  The impact  They have  To this day  I drive past there  Every day  And I'm  So angry  And pissed off  Just driving past  The site  And people just  They look in the paper  Oh  20 years  Oh  Whatever  And then  You know something  A few short years  Time flies on by  Man  And 20s max

[01:17:30]  But you gotta go  Out  John what's going on  Hey good afternoon  Gentlemen  Good afternoon  Anthony loved your comments  Today  Love and love and love  Many events  You know  93  They tried to take down  The World Trade Center  And now in 2001  They successfully did it  And you know what  People do forget  As Americans  It's a sad sad truth  But we just kick back  We forget  It becomes a part of history  We can't forget about  Stuff like this  Because we gotta stay angry  We gotta stay focused  And we gotta stay on target 
[01:18:00]  With what the goal here is  And the goal here is  Get these  Mother efforts  Out of our country  One way or the other  You know  You know what  There has been a lot done  Especially since then  To make things a little safer  Or at least the perception  Of safety  You know  You can't  You can't really take the truck  Through the tunnel anymore  Could you imagine the day  In 93  That an Arab man  Driving that  Goddamn rider truck  Was able to park  In the basement  Of the World Trade Center  Could you imagine  Anything like that 
[01:18:30]  Happening now  No  No  They find new ways  Of doing things  And the planes  Another idea  Now  The security at the airports  Are huge  I've heard apartment bombs  Are what they  I had heard  Where they're going to  Bomb apartments  That they're living in  And they will do that  Because they attack civilians  That's the way they operate  They're looking for  You know something  It's the thing of  Topping yourself  They're looking for  That next big thing  In order to top  The Trade Center  You've got to go  Nuke or something 
[01:19:00]  You know  It's got to be  Something so big  It's not going to be  A plane hitting  Into another building  Never has  They're not going to  Do something  That is less than  Because they'll just look  Out like  Oh alright  We've been there  Well only 200 people  Died that time  You know  It doesn't really compare  To the Twin Towers thing  So  And I'm not  I'm not even talking  About the safety  And the thing  The cops  And the military  Are doing  I'm just talking  About the public  The way  Where's the outcry  If  They said

[01:54:30]  Cut off for that  Oh yes you can  No you can't  I might be in agreeance  With all of you  On this one  There's a whole hormone thing  That happens  One girl is all moody  Because she has it  It's going to wreck  The mood of the party  But it's a party atmosphere  They're fine  We're all dancing  And clapping  I'm fat  We get one chance  To put the perfect party together  With just hot chicks  We're going to  We're going to  You know  Play with the rules a little bit  What's wrong with a little rag time  One girl with the hormone thing happening  Could wreck it for everyone  I'm telling you  I don't know

[02:32:00]  Well come on down and give Anthony a hug  Did you tell  Anthony mentally I'm giving you a hug  Ken  Yes  Did you tell Rick to take that little copied thing that I sent you  And shove it up my pain  Did you say that  I said it but I was smiling when I said it  You said that to me  Well no no I said it to Rick  There you go goodbye  See  He was saying I should shove it up my A  Why are you hanging up on Ken 
[02:32:30]  Because I am not ready for a hug  And I find out I send down  Evidence  Valuable evidence  How about he just gives you a little pat  I was wondering what you're doing with your hand  I thought a yambang squeeze  No a little one of those  Hey  I take that  Hey  A little  Hey that was a good shot  Pat on the behind  Get up Noah  Like hey that  You guys got some good ratings in Philly today  Pat  Pat  You're out of your mind  Like he's greeting you halfway down the third baseline on the home run truck

[02:33:30]  No  There will be no show of affection  No fun  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet  No helmets  No hugs  No nothing  We quickly spoke during the break  And uh  It's not that you're gay or anything  It's just a quick hug  There is uh  No reason for hugs  I don't think you've had a manly hug  Uh  In recent years  Do you want a hug?  No  What  Is that a bad thing? 
[02:34:00]  Well my dad gives me a hug still  Sure  My dad's dead  That's it  That's the last man I hugged  That's what I'm thinking  I'm thinking you might need a manly hug at this point in your life  I think I was well beyond needing the manly hug  I have no problem admitting I hug my dad every once in a while  Yeah  I hug my chick  Call me crazy  I don't want to hug men  There's room in your life for a manly hug every once in a while aunt  Go get Ken  Here's Ken  Take  Take that thing you sent me

[03:10:30]  to a lot of bands  and stuff  and a lot of people  just come through  and you kind of  talk of them and stuff  but you know  you've been cool  and we're hanging out  and then in between  when we're even on the air  just talking  it's fun stuff  We've actually become friends  Yeah  You'll become  you'll become too big  and you'll blow us off  Oh come on  now see  that's that advanced  that advanced thought  We used to have this relationship  with like the Goo Goo Dolls  and we had it with  Rob Zombie for a while  Yeah for 10 minutes  Stop  If you don't leave me

[03:11:30]  is my fist  Okay goodnight  Some people are into that  That's what she calls  She's hanging up  She was real smooth there  Oh I wish she would have  cursed before she hung up  God almighty  Just one  It was almost too clean  Yeah  You do what you do  You put nitroglycerin  on your helmet  and she'll pop it  right in her mouth  as her heart starts to flutter  You rotten old bag of meat  You gotta explain that  You gotta explain that  You gotta explain that  Picture the cryptkeeper  in a diaper with one breast  and a dead spouse  under a septic tank  and you have the lady  that just called us  You gotta explain 
[03:12:00]  This is one of the best stories  that we've ever heard  This old broad is completely insane  She called us up a while back  and said that her boyfriend  had died  It wasn't even a husband  It was Irene  Yeah  Her boyfriend died  He was feeling ill  like he thought he had the flu  He was up all night  like ill  as she was sleeping  and he decided  he goes  I'm not feeling well  and goes into the bathroom  And she continued to sleep  And she just keeps sleeping  She didn't think it was a big deal  So she hears like  Oh help me  And finally 
[03:12:30]  she goes into the bathroom  after a while  She rolls over a couple times  tries to go back to sleep  Yeah like  Oh would you  Shut up with that  Stop it with the help me  She goes into the bathroom  finally  There's her boyfriend  He had a heart attack  on the floor  of the bathroom  So I guess  she was able enough  to get the sleepy seeds  out of her eyes  enough to call the ambulance  and they put him  in the ambulance  and he died  in the ambulance  And she pretty much  admitted that  she should have  woke up  Maybe she should have  She called and told you this 
[03:13:00]  Yeah  Wow  And now she  calls and she curses  She hates our show  But she listens every day  No she hates that  we're sexist  she says  She loves Jimmy Norton  Yeah because she  I wear a Spider-Man shirt  and it just does something to her  and she wants to take the helmet  and just blah blah blah  But she's embarrassed about that  because she's probably 75  and she shouldn't be  having those feelings  Yeah she's some older woman  So there you go  Now you're kind of caught up  She's out  On her  Clearly hours of details  Oh yeah  Yeah  Scotty Crane's on the phone 
[03:13:30]  He's been waiting an hour and a half  and I apologize  You know Bob Crane  No tell me about it  From Hogan's Heroes  Oh okay  Yeah yeah yeah  Here we go  This is his son  Scotty  How are you guys doing?  Scotty put his  We're rejected right?  Scotty put a site together  website with films  that his father took  because Bob Crane was like  he used to love to F  and videotape  not videotape  but film  some video  and photograph  himself having sex  with women  Right  And Scotty Crane  took all these old films  of his father  and put them on a website  So he's like  he's making a little bit of cake 
[03:14:00]  and showing his father  tagging these chicks  And it's a good quality  like you said  it's on film right?  This is actual film  Yes some of them  are pretty good  He had some of the best  film equipment  that like an amateur  would have  As he should  Good lighting  Oh here it is  And he also had  a huge mule  Yeah he had  a pretty good sized mule  that thanks to Scotty  everyone got to see  So Scotty  Yeah what's going on  you guys  it's great to be back  You're in the New York 
[03:14:30]  You're making me  follow that Irene bitch  What's up with that man?  How am I supposed  to compete?  Well just don't curse  because she seems  to have a potty mouth  You're already ahead  of the game  Speaking of potty mouth  I heard about  Norton's diaper party  he wants to have with her  That sounds alright  Hey Scotty  can you wait  one more minute?  Yeah sure  I've got to be  doing another interview  at 4 o'clock  so it's got to be quick  What time?  You're probably in LA  I'm in LA  It's 3 o'clock right now  Oh you've got plenty of time  Hold on  only just for a minute  because we've got to 
[03:15:00]  finish up with Irene  Jennifer's on the line  she's saying that  she's the sister-in-law  of Irene's dead husband  Hello  Hi Jennifer  Hi guys  How are you?  Good afternoon  Hi  Now are you really  the sister-in-law?  I am the sister-in-law  of Irene's  deceased boyfriend  I married his brother  Wow  Alright  Now what happened?  Well I mean  you know  I understand it's a radio show  and everything  and it's got to be funny  I've been in and around radio  my entire life  so you know  I understand the whole thing  but my husband 
[03:15:30]  is a little upset  because he heard  the first time that she called  it was really very tragic  He was  Of course it was  and that goddamn Irene  wouldn't get up  We're not making light  of his death  It's not him  It's not him  we have the problem  We cannot believe  that Irene decided to sleep  instead of helping her husband  Well look  I'm not  It's just an amazing story  if you think about it  Well it was  it was a very tragic thing  I mean he was only 49  and he passed away  on his 49th birthday  Oh  Tragedy  And he was the only brother  of my husband  the only sibling 
[03:16:00]  of my husband  of a family  that there are not  too many people left of  so I mean like  it was just really  It is a true tragedy  because the tragedy  is when  his love for Irene  led to his own downfall  Oh my God  Oh  Well you know  I don't want to cause  any family strife  but there was never  any good blood  between any of them  anyway  except for my husband  and his brother  What do you think  of that Irene?  You know  she's always been  nice to me  Nice?  Is she  is she certifiably insane?  Well I am not 
[03:16:30]  a licensed physician  and so therefore  I can't make that judgment  I'm not either  but I can  I will say that  she can be a bit  high strong at times  and sometimes  I don't understand  what she does  What does she look like?  Yeah what does she look like?  Please  as vividly as you can  could you please  describe her?  Well God  she's got to be  at least 5'3  She's very very thin  Really?  Last time I saw her  she had red hair  Like Bozo Red?  That big  Ronald McDonald Red? 
[03:17:00]  I'm trying to be nice guys  because this is family  No don't be nice  be very accurate  She sounds like  a flying monkey  Does she leave  from tree to tree?  Extremely processed  and she  I'm a smoker  but she chain smokes  Yeah  Yeah and you know  I mean it's just  the whole thing is bad  like my husband  you know like I said  he doesn't have  any family left  But how pissed  is your husband  that Irene could have  saved you know  No you know what  we believe  saved his life there  We believe that  there was really nothing  that could have been  done about that 
[03:17:30]  because the heart disease  was advanced  and nobody really  knew about it  My husband is more  upset that she  goes on the air  and she tells people  these things  Why did she go on the air  initially to tell about it  just because it was  something on her mind  I think that maybe  she might be lonely  You think?  Yeah  She's going after Norton  of course she's there  And she called  and was really nasty  You heard her call  the call  She was nasty  And that's why  we make fun of her  So tell your husband  we feel bad  that his brother  passed away  Yeah of course we do  It's an attack on her  not the dead brother  Believe me  I understand 
[03:18:00]  it's just that  my husband  that first call  a couple of weeks ago  he came home  and he was on  the verge of tears  He couldn't believe  that she aired  the family's laundry  on the air  Okay well he knew  that it was her  that called  I know it was  I called him  and said  oh my god  Irene is on 1027  and he said  you've got to be kidding  and she has a very  unmistakable voice  Yeah  Of course she does  It's either her  or Babe Ruth calling  We used to do  something nice  for the memory  of the husband  Yeah well  he was a nice guy  he was a postal worker 
[03:18:30]  he worked real hard  and you know  Oh no wonder  he had a heart attack  Yeah well  Those guys are  a little high strung  Very much so  Very much so  Alright Jennifer  Alright well  thanks a lot guys  Hey did you send us  a picture of Irene  do you have a picture  of her  You know  I probably do  Oh please  we'll hang it up  in our office  We certainly will  Next to the Olsen twins  and a stripper  She called up  she's just trying  to get in my pants  and I'm not interested  so if you talk to her  tell her nothing personal  Hey Jennifer  when's her birthday?  You know I don't know  I've never been  really close to her  Like I said 
[03:19:00]  she didn't marry  into the family  and you know  she's much much  older than me  I figured  we could send her  some alarm clocks  Oh god  Alarm clock  and a stethoscope  Maybe one of those  medic alert buttons  to hang around  her rotten neck  her rotten  ineffective neck  Jesus  the melatonin queen  Alright Jennifer  thank you  Thank you for taking  my call guys  Bye Jennifer  Bye bye  My husband's fallen  and I can't wake up  I feel bad  I hope the guys  think we're  Jesus  That horrible 
[03:19:30]  Of course we're not  I know  She wants you  Norton  She wants you  Dude she really  bugs me  because she's just  a lonely bag  who's calling  and complaining  about morals  Shut your face  You're into the  over 40 thing  aren't you  I'm sorry buddy  You're into the  over 40 thing  aren't you  No not at all  I'm a believer  in euthanization  after a certain age  You know what I mean  As soon as they get  a little gray up there  and these things  start to a thing  just smother them  I thought you were  into a diaper party  I was getting excited  for some potty tricks  and stuff  Speaking of potty  Hey Scotty 
[03:20:00]  Yeah  Because we're running  out of time  So what happened  to you  What happened at the  screening of this movie  about your dad  It was an ejection  Oh man  It was just  It was bad  It was dying  Sony is having  this press  like screening  in L.A.  and I took time  off work  flew down to L.A.  because I got  invited by a journalist  to go with him  as his guest  and I get off the plane  and I get a call  from the guy  and he's like  Sony says you can't go  and I'm like  why not  and they're like  well because  your half brother 
[03:20:30]  is going to be there  and they don't want a scene  and I'm like  you know  what is that  he gets to see the film  and I don't  besides the fact  it's like  he's 52  and I'm 31  it's not going to be  Jerry Springer  you know what I mean  Hey Scotty  what's the deal  with you and your brother  having the same name  I'm Robert Scott Crane  he's Robert David Crane  and my dad  was Robert Edward Crane  It's a little odd  I know  He's running around  calling himself  Bob Crane Jr.  and there's no  Bob Crane Jr.  So anyway  I'm like 
[03:21:00]  are you serious  they won't let me go  and they go  well they now say  that they won't let you go  because you're not  a member of the media  and this is for a press screening  I'm like  I've got a syndicated radio show  so then they said  okay well  then Scotty can't go  because he's filed a lawsuit  against us  which I haven't  I haven't even done that  they're just like  out and out wide  Are you waiting for the release  and then you're going to  hit him with a lawsuit?  Well the fact is  I don't know what's in the movie  I saw the shooting script  I have no idea  what's in the movie  Because all I know  I'm just going off  of what I read  they're saying that  you're just waiting  and when the movie comes out 
[03:21:30]  there's some kind of  defamation suit  you might  I have to make that choice  when the movie comes out  you know what I mean  I haven't seen  I haven't seen  what's in the movie  What's the $25,000 write-off?  You know what  they wanted to give me  $20,000  to say that I wouldn't sue them  and they even offered  Paul Schrader  the director  offered me a role  in the film  he's like  Scotty I can get you  in the film  make you a star  I'm just like  you know what  tell the truth  about my family  and I'll sign your paper  I hear this movie  is a little glazed over  it doesn't really 
[03:22:00]  what's it about  it's not an accurate  portrayal of your father  no it's called  Autofocus  The Life of Bob Crane  and you know what  it's anything but  The Life of Bob Crane  it's just something  dreamed up by Paul Schrader  you know what  Paul Schrader is a great  director and a great writer  I mean he wrote  Taxi Driver  but think about it  like these movies  are just totally dark  and their characters  have no compassion  your father was  bludgeoned to death  isn't that dark  well that wasn't him  you know what I mean  that's what happened  to him  yeah but that's  kind of a dark ending 
[03:22:30]  yeah but he doesn't  even deal with the murder  all he does is deal  with Bob Crane's wife  and he totally paints  my dad to be this  dark sinister portrait  of a man  and it's just  nothing further  from the truth  yeah  yeah and he's saying  that my dad took  all these pictures  and photos of women  without their knowledge  and if you go to  bobcrane.com  right now  you'll see all the women  are smiling and mugging  for the camera  so anyway  that's because they're  looking at your father's  fabulously huge scene  I know  I smile when I see it  I'm not gay  I look like I'm 
[03:23:00]  from above and below  the waist  I'll tell you that one  so Scotty  it's safe to say  you will be suing  right  no it's not safe  to say that  because I don't know  I haven't seen the film  you know what I mean  yeah  what do you think  about Greg Kinnear  playing your dad  I'm guessing that  Jim Belushi  wasn't available  that's all I can figure  why did you think  Jim Belushi  looked more like him  or are you kidding  I was sarcasm  I didn't know  I think they were  going more for the look  because you could  almost kind of see  Greg Kinnear  wearing the Hogan  uniform and almost 
[03:23:30]  pulling it off  with a little smirk  on his face  or something  but yeah  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know much  about your father  aside from him  being Hogan  they're also claiming  that you're not  Greg Kinnear  doing Johnny Carson  that's what it is  it's a Greg Kinnear  impersonation of Johnny Carson  and I've seen a few scenes  and you know  what it looks like  it looks like  one of those  really bad  SNL skits  they're also claiming  or hinting that  you're not Bob Crane's  son right  right exactly  you guys met me  I know  that I thought  was ridiculous  because you look  like him  so  right 
[03:24:00]  and it's like  you know  I talked to some  people who did  see the screening  and they're like  oh yeah  that scene's still  in there  so it's like  yeah  they're claiming  that I'm not  Bob Crane's  son  so anyway  so how did you  come about them  what are they  saying in the movie  what's  oh they say  that uh  they say that  they hint  they basically  make  they put it out  that it's a possibility  that my mother  basically  or they hint at it  that my mother  tricked my father  into marrying him  through getting pregnant  and that it's not  his kid  it's like  I'm the spitting image  of Bob Crane  you know what I mean 
[03:24:30]  I go down to the grocery store  and people are like  hey you look like Bob Crane  they didn't speculate  as to who maybe  your dad was  it wasn't Schultz  was it  it might have been  Sergeant Schultz  no they didn't speculate  at all  LeBeau  little French guy  anyway  so I  so I just like  well I'm going to the screening  I'm just going  whether or not  they say I can go  it's like  I'm going to go  and so I show up  and I walk  out to the door  and I go  hey I'm Robert Crane  and they let me in  and I sit  directly behind my brother  who I haven't seen  now what  are you starting trouble 
[03:25:00]  no I'm not starting trouble  I'm sitting behind my brother  I didn't even see him  I like walked in the theater  and I sat down  and I'm like  oh my god  that's my brother  I haven't seen the guy  in 24 years  last time I saw him  was at the funeral  why is that  because my father  Bob Crane  essentially wrote  his Bobby side  of the family  out of the will  he basically  disinherited him  in his will  there was nothing  left to them  really  and it was all  left to me  and my mother  and my mother  is portrayed in this film  I'm portrayed in this film  and they never even 
[03:25:30]  want to talk to us  you know what I mean  they talked to us  once the film  was like nine days  away from finishing  shooting  that's when they're like  oh yeah  you know  and I offered to let him  talk to my mother  they wouldn't even talk to her  Paul Schrader was like  no I don't need to  don't need to huh  so what did you say  to your brother  in the theater  so anyway  I'm like  I'm sitting behind him  for two minutes  and I walk in with Michelle  and you know Michelle  she's gorgeous  it's like a small theater  and no one  Michelle my wife  and I walk in  and I'm like  there's no way  he didn't see me  walk in  and so I finally 
[03:26:00]  just tapped him  on the shoulder  and I'm like  hey Bobby  it's Scotty  how are you  it's been like  24 years  and we shook hands  we smiled  we got along fine  and then like  this security guard  comes and taps me  on the shoulder  and he's like  excuse me  you have to leave  and I'm like  what  and he's like  excuse me  you have to leave  and I'm like  why  and he's like  you're not allowed  to see this film  and I'm like  but my brother is  and he's like  you're not allowed  to see this film  and I'm like  there's 70 journalists  in this room right now  you really don't want me  to make a scene  do you  why don't you  just let me  watch the film  and he said  no you have to leave  and so I like  just said 
[03:26:30]  hey Bobby  they don't want to see  let me see the film  about our dad  and I just stood up  and then I threw  all these  bobcrane.com stickers  up in the air  these journalists  and I said  and I said  hey my name's  Scotty Crane  and they were like  grabbing at it  and going  okay okay  and I'm like  hey my name's  Scotty Crane  I'm not allowed  to see this film  for some reason  Sony doesn't want  me to see it  and if you want  to contact me  get a hold of me  through that web address  oh so they went  crazy calling you up  and everything right  it's been nuts today  yeah I bet  it's been insane  I didn't have  been contacted  about Gene Simmons  what does he want 
[03:27:00]  he wants to talk to me  everyone wants to talk to me  it's crazy  how does it figure in  for Gene Simmons  to make a buck on it  because that's the only  reason Gene would call  there's a lot of money  involved somewhere  you don't even know yet  I don't even know  I want some of the  new characters in Kiss  to wear the Hogan's  Heroes makeup  trying to get away  from the conventional makeup  so my wife and I  went to Gene Simmons  house it was intense  I got to meet  like a childhood  I told you guys  it's like when my dad  was raising me  he was a legendary  radio guy in LA  he would put on Kiss 
[03:27:30]  records and like  make me take it  to the post  really nice  yeah I totally  trained me to do this  that's because he was  banging somebody  under the console  at the time  so he needed you  to work the board  he needed a  microphone and a  tape recorder  hey son work the board  I gotta go nail this  bitch  hey what's the coolest  thing Gene Simmons  has in his house  there  what's the coolest  thing  yeah  he's got a whole  wing of his house  like basically  it's a Kiss museum  it's like every single  pinball machine  character  what's the coolest 
[03:28:00]  thing he has  in the house  that would be great  to see  probably take him  on the tour  he's got a new  clothing line  the logo is  Moneybags  have you seen this  really  yeah  he has the Halloween  mask  he has the Halloween  mask  yeah I remember  the little tiny  plastic Halloween  mask that were  like Gene Simmons  masks  oh Kiss  right yeah  yeah  for kids to wear  yeah Michelle and I  both wore them  when we were little  kids  they were sitting  there  I love that stuff  and he was doing  his Kiss condoms  and his new autobiography  like Kiss and Makeup  it was actually good  it was great to meet  him he was actually  a gentleman  you're gonna have to

[03:43:30]  which has the  perfect proportions  of barley, hops, and yeast.  Did you notice I left out fruit?  Now, I have nothing against the hard-working  lemon and lime producers of the world, but when I want  a beer, I'm not looking for some  bizarro mango kiwi surprise.  I want something that tastes like  beer. Like Amstel Light.  They don't need to pull some  cover-up of Watergate proportions  to distract you from its taste.  Amstel Light tastes good because it's  from Amsterdam, and it's made by people who  have beer in their blood. So next 
[03:44:00]  time you're ordering a beer, tell them to skip the  fruit cocktail and give you an Amstel  Light. Always satisfying,  never watered down. Amstel Light.  The beer drinkers like beer.  Imported by Amstel USA, White Plains, New York.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sitting in today, Andrew WK, 
[03:44:30]  our new friend. Oh yeah.  Thank you. Not a new friend anymore.  We've been hanging a while.  He might even party with us tonight.  A midlife friend. That's cool techno music.  You like it? I like that, yeah.  That's like trance. Is that what they call that?  Like puts you in a trance.  It's oak and foam. Oh, it's awesome.  Yeah. Depends on how much E you do.  Yeah, it's trance. It's a time.  And finally, there's so many kinds of techno music.  To me, it's all techno. You want to dance?  Yeah.  But apparently there's a lot of divisions.  So I'm like an idiot going in.  Hey, do you have a new techno CD?  That looks like a total idiot, but  I've determined that the kind I really like 
[03:45:00]  is this kind, which is called trance.  Trance. You should, yeah,  take some E and then Opie does the glow sticks  in front of your face and it's great.  And pokes them right in your eye.  Yeah, that's been a really good sentence.  Dude, it felt like you poked me in the eye.  No, I did, ass.  Ready. Steady.  Oh, my God.  I said oak and foam.  Billy Max in here.  He brought in one of his birthday presents.  A 50-pound bottle.  It's not measured by fluid ounces or gallons. 
[03:45:30]  It's measured by pounds.  It's the biggest bottle of beer we've ever seen.  It's like three foot high.  That is a huge bottle of Heineken.  Yeah, you couldn't fit it in a normal refrigerator.  Ben throws his own birthday party every year.  And tonight's the night.  You know, that's a brilliant move.  We're not saying where.  Oh, we're not saying where.  Don't worry.  Look at Ben.  We're not saying where.  It's a brilliant move, though.  A lot of people, other people plan their birthday parties  and it sucks.  You get there and it sucks.  Ben makes sure his party's the way he wants it.  And then we all go down there and party. 
[03:46:00]  Have a great time.  Yeah.  Party hard.  He's got Liquid Todd spinning.  Yeah, Liquid Todd spinning for him.  Who gets Liquid Todd a spin at their birthday party?  Ben.  He does.  Ben does.  Ben.  All right.  We're blown up.  What did we learn today?  Because you know what?  This show was just all over the ball field.  Think it'd be some girls here, Ben?  It's not educational today.  No.  No.  And I guess we'll get more girls for our Crystal Method party tomorrow.  Cool.  Yeah, Tuesday.  That's dance music.  That's techno.  Yeah, they're good, man.  We got Crystal Method coming in to spin and jam and do all that fun stuff on Tuesday. 
[03:46:30]  We're having a pajama party, man.  We're going to get a bunch of girls in PJs.  We're going to set up the outside, and they're going to have a little party.  They're going to dance.  Yeah.  They're going to dance.  We got to get some lights and everything.  You want to try to get one more girl?  Yeah, let's do this.  Want to explain to Andrew what's going on?  Yeah, tell me.  You got to include me in these things.  I want to know.  Andrew, the limits that Opie has put on this selection of girls has gotten ridiculous.  Meaning very broad or very, very, very broad?  No, it's so narrow, it's retarded. 
[03:47:00]  He's turning down the hottest girls.  No, no, no.  The girls cannot be under five foot tall.  That's a good rule, right?  No, well, wait a minute.  What if the girls...  I think one of the most exciting things in the world is a girl who looks like she's six  feet tall, but is actually four feet tall.  Right.  Proportions.  Proportions.  That's what I said.  Like Kylie Minogue is under five feet tall, and you wouldn't turn her down in a million  years.  You're out of your mind.  For our crystal method party?  Yes, I would.  Oh, my God.  And then the girls cannot be having their time of the month. 
[03:47:30]  He doesn't want them having their time.  Don't you understand that they're more excitable, and they're swollen, and they're all voluptuous,  and there's too much hormones floating around, and it's going to wreck the moods of all  their...  He thinks it's going to make all the other girls grouchy.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  The girls relate.  They cuddle, and they take care of each other.  They can't do things like that.  They can't have boyfriends.  They can't be wearing jeans, skirts.  No periods.  If you sneeze, the carpet's ruined.  Nobody needs that.  And then there's another one, the hair. 
[03:48:00]  He's got this thing where the hair can't be too short.  One of the girls showed up.  That we had a problem with the hair.  Really?  To show it personally.  How short is too short?  How short?  Over the years is a problem.  Like if the girl's got, like, hair that's cut over the ears.  No buzz cuts.  Right?  No shaved heads.  But that's what I said.  I go, no buzz cuts or shaved heads.  It's fine, but there are some girls that have short hair, and it looks good on them.  It looks fantastic.  Yeah.  The little bob.  Oh, yeah.  They have that bob type.  And the hair.  What is she doing?  And the hair cannot touch their, uh, miss?  The hair cannot touch the crack of their hair. 
[03:48:30]  Hey, miss.  So it can't be too short or too long?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Long hair.  No, no.  And now get this.  The girls can't be over 5'8".  That's insane.  Because that will scare the other girls.  No.  You want them all proportional.  This is really, really limited.  I like a frightened girl.  And I guarantee you, the more, the more rope you give them to narrow it, the narrower  it's going to get.  And it's going to eventually be one kind of girl.  Right.  And over and over again.  Yeah.  And no, and no former models.  One girl was trying to trick her, saying I'm, I was a former model.  Maybe.  But she does landscaping on the side.  She did, though.  You know how you can meet them? 
[03:49:00]  Maybe you can drive around in Florida in your brown Volkswagen, ask to help you a load  a boat while you have a sling on your arm, you psychopath.  All right, let's see what Jennifer's all about.  Jennifer, where are you calling from?  Jennifer.  Jennifer.  Did she go away?  There was a rumbling that went on.  Yeah, I heard something.  I think she was being assaulted.  We just gave this huge explanation so we could lead into Jennifer's call.  Hey, girl on the phone.  Oh, man.  I think she's gone, right?  I heard something.  Pounding that phone into her balloon notch.  You're breathing.  Well, we're going to have to screen more girls tomorrow. 
[03:49:30]  I think we've got five or six girls so far that passed all the requirements.  Get that girl in here real fast.  Has it happened where one has said they were something, come in, they were not, and they  didn't meet the...  Oh, he says he's going to sit there on a stool and give the thumbs up or thumbs down as they're  walking in.  See?  Look at her.  What's your problem?  Very sexy.  Man, your pictures didn't do you justice.  Wait, hold on.  Yeah, she was the one that was trying to describe her hair over the phone. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, it's really hard to explain.  Are you a real redhead?  No.  Okay.  She has kind of redhead...  I have blonde hair, but it's dyed.  You have very pink skin, though.  That's a redhead quality.  That's very desirable.  She's cute, man.  There's no hair color requirements, are there?  No.  No.  Thank goodness.  No, but he had a problem with a darker-haired girl with the brown eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too plain for it.  I know.  I want to smack him.  You don't like the plain look?  It was more that she was a mix of chinky and Irish. 
[03:50:30]  Black Irish.  That's a beautiful, beautiful thing, black Irish.  That's when the Spaniards invaded Ireland.  Yeah.  Beautiful things came out of that time.  There you go.  It was Chinese and Irish.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, she was a mess.  So clearly, the hair's too short for your...  No, this girl's fine.  Oh, yeah.  And did you...  I told you, right?  Did you lose weight between now and the time that...  I might have lost, like, five pounds.  I think because you photographed heavier than you look.  That's that Hollywood diet.  That one-day juice diet.  The miracle juice.  Blow it out your canned diet.  We found your picture because you told...  Stack or two. 
[03:51:00]  You told us to find your picture.  Right.  And I looked at your picture and went, uh-oh, how are we going to tell her?  Then you showed up and you're much better than those pictures.  She's very sweet, too.  She has a very sweet look in her eye.  She has a nice disposition.  Yeah.  She's in.  We only got a couple minutes.  You take that Hollywood miracle diet.  It looks like you fired a salad shooter into the bowl.  Yeah.  We're on someone's guest.  Pay 40 bucks for an enema.  Yeah, pretty much.  Hey, Jen, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You're 27 years old.  Yeah, but I don't look 27.  No?  See, there's an age thing.  I look about 20. 
[03:51:30]  There's an age thing.  It's supposed to be like a teen birthday pajama.  We started as an under-20 party, and then these guys are like, well, it's okay if they're  in their early teens.  Early 20s.  Now, all of a sudden, we're up into the upper teens.  No, not early teens.  Early 20s.  Let me put it here this way.  Freudian pedophile.  Early 20s.  Do you have a little mustache that you put on?  The internet teens where they're 50 with pigtails and a cheerleader outfit.  Doesn't that annoy the crap out of you?  You go to a teen site.  Internet teens.  Just confused.  That's hilarious.  No internet teens. 
[03:52:00]  Internet teens.  She's an internet teen.  You're going to show them in their cheerleading outfits, and they're like 45 years old.  You know she's a 42-year-old, flat-chested mother of three.  Pigtails and a C-section.  Internet teens.  God damn.  Yeah, it is.  You click on something that says, you know, teen, you click, and it's like, oh, great.  She's got her school books and everything.  There she is.  She's really trying to work it.  This is not an internet teen we're talking to.  That's...  No.  No.  Hey, Jen, could you call us tomorrow, because I think we've run out of show. 
[03:52:30]  Sure thing.  We're going to need to spend some time with you to make sure you're all right for the  party, okay?  Crucial.  Okay.  All right, Jen.  Oh, Jen?  Yes.  Man, that's...

See ya.

Ken Stevens outside the studio waiting to hug you.  I'm not getting a hug from Ken Stevens.  You are.  Maybe he's got a beer hug.  There's no way.  Yes.  I don't think we're...  You had a problem with Ken?  At the beginning of the show, it looks like you guys smoothed things over.  No, we talked and I was still cursing and I...  He's now okay with hugging you.  He's now okay with...  I don't want a hug.  Give me the kind of hug where his hand is clammy and wet and presses through the back 
[03:53:30]  of your shirt.  Oh, and you feel it.  Yeah, you feel it soak through.  It's our secret hug.  Yeah.  The priest hug.  All right.  We've got to get off the air.  It's time to party with Ben for his birthday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There we go.  His birthday's not even tonight.  No.  He picks his birthday.  He makes his own party.  It's all about the party.  Jimmy's birthday is tomorrow, though.  Tomorrow's Jimmy's.  My birthday is tomorrow, so somebody has to drink out of my tainted mule in celebration.  Tonight?  It'll happen.  Yeah, let's hope.  At 12-01, I want...  And Andrew WK, you're coming back soon to rock this play.

[03:54:30]  Check out the CD, I Get Wet, all right?  Yeah.  Speaking of I Get Wet, you want to talk about the yellow discipline.  See?  But that's cool.  That means there's another reason to come back.  Oh, we're going to have a thing organized, and we'll figure it out.  It's going to be a contest.  It's going to be about liquids and fluids and quantities.  All right.  Andrew WK is into the yellow discipline thing.  And he'll explain next time he's on our show, okay?  Thank you.  Good.  See?
