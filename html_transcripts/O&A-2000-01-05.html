<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with "Whippin' Out Wednesday," a listener participation segment, followed by a discussion of comedian Adam Ferrara being unexpectedly cut from the David Letterman show.  Opie and Anthony expressed their outrage at Letterman's segment choices (a Rams quarterback, chicken soup, and Lauren Bacall), contacted Ferrara for his account, and aired his frustrated response.  The conversation then veered into a discussion of a Penthouse photo spread depicting lesbian strap-on sex, with the hosts debating its aesthetic appeal and encountering technical difficulties with their phone lines, leading to some frustrated banter with Rick and Spaz.  They interspersed this with giving away WWF tickets to callers.  Listener calls continued the discussion of the Penthouse photos throughout the segment.


The show continued with a substantial portion dedicated to listener reactions to the Penthouse photo and a similar in-studio event from the previous year.  Callers shared diverse responses, ranging from arousal to disgust.  This segment also included a lengthy discussion of the New York Radio Message Board, where listeners debated the station's rebranding and the show itself.  Opie and Anthony read and mocked several posts, many of which were sexually explicit.  The segment featured numerous calls from women interested in the show's "Lesbian for a Day" segment, describing themselves and detailing their interest.  The show ended this section with the news that the New York Radio Message Board had been shut down.


A significant portion of the broadcast then focused on threesomes, featuring explicit caller accounts of their experiences, including details of sex toys and sexual acts.  Callers Giovanna and Lisa shared their personal experiences, with Giovanna detailing threesomes involving her husband, friends, and even go-go dancers, and Lisa describing a failed attempt to arrange a threesome for her husband's birthday.  The discussion broadened to encompass listener preferences on body types, with mentions of pictures from the show's unofficial website, particularly one of a host in a fur coat.  The hosts played a song about Raft Boy and another comedic song about a gerbil, and also touched on the audio quality of older show recordings.


The show shifted towards professional wrestling, featuring in-studio guests Steve from the unofficial website and Sick Boy from xwrestling.com.  The hosts discussed upcoming events, wrestlers' personas, and their past interactions with wrestlers like The Rock and Chris Jericho, providing predictions on storylines. This section involved further sexually explicit conversations.


A later segment heavily focused on professional wrestling, specifically Stephanie McMahon's appearance, which was discussed in vulgar terms. They critiqued various wrestlers' performances, including Sergeant Slaughter, Bob Backlund (running for Congress), and the Iron Sheik.  A caller provided updates on the wrestlers' current activities, and they also discussed Stone Cold Steve Austin's upcoming surgery and potential WrestleMania appearance. The segment included a discussion of "Whip'em Out Wednesday," John Rocker's altercation, the Ted Turner/Jane Fonda divorce (focusing on their net worth), and Rosie O'Donnell's adoption, all peppered with offensive language and homophobic slurs. The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featuring vulgar and humorous caller responses, and announcements that The Rock and possibly Jeffrey Ross would be guests the following day.

[00:08:30]  It doesn't work anymore  It's not like the old Dave  Well between him and  Jay Leno though  Yeah well Leno's just  I'll tell you who the best is  It's Conan  Conan rocks  Yeah Conan funny  Conan's almost what  Dave used to be  Right  When Dave first started  Well when I  The last time I remember  Watching Dave  Is when I was in college  And he used to make  The screen all fuzzy  When I was tripping  So  Alright see you later  Alright remember  Those things like  Monkey cam and stuff  Yeah  Dave put the monkey 
[00:09:00]  The camera on top  Of a monkey's head  And let him just run  Through the studio  And he had monkey cam  God damn  Now that was funny  George what's up  What's going on  Yo I was on Letterman one time  And I gotta stick out for him man  I'm sticking out  How long ago  I still think the show's good  Last New Year's Eve  Oh yeah what'd you do  Stupid human tricks  Hey what are you able to do man  I can stick out my gut  So I look like a pregnant woman  And I roll a quarter off  It bounces on a table  Into a glass  Really  Yeah that's pretty good  Where the hell are you  I'd like to see that  I'm in Newark

[00:10:00]  For an afternoon  Right  Because we know  It's going to help  Our show  But instead  Dave sits there  With bits that are  Just going nowhere  When he could have  Adam on  Yeah I guess  Six minutes  Was all he would have needed  Six lousy minutes  They couldn't have cut up  That god forsaken  Show us your photos  Bit  That went nowhere  Oh  Got six minutes  Out of that  Talking with that  Damn Rams quarterback  Who cares  Yeah  Yeah exactly  I mean you know  A quick little  How you doing  Let's go outside  And throw a football

[00:11:00]  Dean on a fax here  What happened to Adam last night  I never watched Letterman  And I stayed up until the end  Then Dave says  That Adam walked out  I'm sure that there's  An interesting explanation  The explanation is  Dave ran too long  With everything else  Yeah  And he does this all the time  You know  We're pointing it out today  Because we're really  Kind of bummed  That we didn't see Adam  But there's other times  Where you're  Looking forward to seeing someone  And they never make it  On the show  Because he watched  45 minutes of  Lame-o-crap  They didn't even get to  Lauren Bacall

[00:26:00]  Oh my God  Please  Instead we get  A box of popcorn  Maybe that's why  Maybe we didn't make  That much money  Now that I think about it  You're right  So  There you go  That's why no calls  Are getting screened  Well now they're  Slowly getting screened  Give me a break  Look at Rick  It's all pissed  It's all pissed  We're not full of crap  1, 2, 3, 4  There's 5 people  5 people calling  We don't know  What they're talking about

Nothing much  I just had a call  You know, I have my neighbor here  Wait, wait  Rick says the phones  Are all locked up  But here's a phone call  Yeah  Well, I was trying to call earlier  It was just ringing, ringing  Maybe there was a problem  With the phone calls  But I was trying to call earlier  Yeah  Because you had that  Ricky Martin bit going  Oh, yeah  And my neighbor was here  And she ran out crying  And I didn't know  What she was crying about  When I went to her apartment  To see what she was crying about  She was crying  Because she insisted  That Ricky Martin  Isn't gay  That homo  We don't know 
[00:29:00]  If he's gay  We honestly don't know  We want to state that  We want to state that  We have no clue  But we made some observations  Earlier, yes  But if you guys  Would have seen it  You guys would have  Pissed your pants  It was incredible  Well, thank you, Andy  Yeah, also  I have a question  Now Spaz is running  Down the hall freaking  Get Spaz in here  Yeah, go ahead, Andy  Yeah, you know that  You know that  Fun Dry Music site?  Foundrymusic.com, yes  Yeah  I've been going there  I've been trying to get  Some stuff off there 
[00:29:30]  For a few days now  I can't seem to get anything  Well, there's something  Wrong with your system  It's there  It's working just fine  I just checked out  Some pictures from Hooters  Right  Before we went on vacation  Oh, really?  Yeah  I didn't know there were  Pictures up there  There's a few of those  And this guy  Obviously  This guy  Frank from Manhattan  Is having no problem  He goes  O&A  I just checked out  The pics of Ant  In his bitchin' 70s  Fur coat  Yeah, that's what  I want to see  The fur coat  It says  What the hell  Was your mom thinking?  The shot with your sister  And older brother  Is great  Your mom dressed you guys

Oh, Andy, your time's up  Oh, okay  No, I'm not going to cut you off  What's another great picture?  Oh, remember  Remember the picture  That you guys were saying  That it was a prom picture  Or something  In the background 
[00:30:30]  There was the couple  Going at it  Oh, yeah  Yeah, yeah  I think that would be  Another great picture  Yeah, that's a pretty good one  You guys are great  All right, man  Here comes the train  I don't want to get hit  All right  Bye  Bye, Andy  Very good  Oh, he goes out of the way  A lot of people think  It's cool to be hit by the train  Trust me  You don't want to be known  As the guy that was hit by the train  On the Opie and Anthony show  So, Spaz, how did the crunch come out?  Yeah, what happened there, Spaz?  You abandoned your post?  You abandoned your post?  Look at the phones 
[00:31:00]  Look at them  I had to go to the bathroom  There was no way around it  I'm sorry  I'll never do it again  Don't you know the crunch  Before the show?  Yeah, but  Yeah, but I had a Big Mac  And a surprise  Yeah, but Rick wasn't here  During the long song  So I was waiting for him to come back  So I wouldn't be leaving a post  At least there would be one person here  Saying  Now, Spaz, how many phones were ringing  When you left?  There was none  That's not true  There were no phones ringing  When I left  I made sure that's not true 
[00:31:30]  Ant and I both have a screen  How many people were enjoying  The Metallica tonight?  Wow  That's very true  Rick is right  Listen, this is the deal  We need more bodies  Working for this radio show  Yeah  But when I crunch?  No, we need like interns and stuff  People that want to, you know, work  And they would rather take a dump in their pants  Than leave their post  Exactly  I very rarely take a dump during the show  We are looking for interns  That's true, right, Rick?  Yeah  Could they email you?  They can email me at  OAProducer at Yahoo.com 
[00:32:00]  You've got to be in college, though  Yeah, because you're going to get credits for it  And stuff  And we only want the serious inquiries  Right  All right  If you're like a pothead  And you just want to like  Come here for a couple hours  In between bond hits  No, thank you  You've got to be in college  That's what it is  I'd still be doing my regular duties, right?  Look at Spaz  It's not an effective job  I don't think duty is something  You've got to worry about  All right  Okay  Look, he's all paranoid  He's doing my regular duties, right?  Well, there'll be 
[00:32:30]  There'll be some competition  We bring in some new blood  And they start showing  Yeah  ONA some stuff  There might be some problems  Yeah, you're right  I think I'm doing a great job on this show  Oh, here he goes  Trying to defend myself  All right, let's go  Here he is where he gets pathetic  Hi, who's this?

What does the date say?  Well, no one, five, two thousand  Yeah?  Yeah  It's funny  It seems to be working  In the studio, we got a screen that, you know, shows all the phone lines and what people want to talk about

Well, give me my penthouse  And this is a serious question  I got the latest issue of penthouse  I'm sure it's serious if it's penthouse  It's about time that the fine people at penthouse send copies of the magazine to us every week 
[00:37:30]  Or every month  What?  My magazine, one?  You didn't get yours?  No  Oh, that's right, you get the blue boy  Oh, that's right, Opie  Blue boy, that's right  The stuff with the men in it  Can we see your stuff?

[00:38:00]  Phil  Oh, look  Oh, no, Phil hung up  I think it's working, though  Okay  I don't know  All right, Ant  What's your question?  Well, I got to phrase this carefully  In the February 2000 issue of penthouse  Yeah  There's the typical, you know, urination pictures and all that  A lot of those  That's very popular little ditty in penthouse  No, I  The past couple of years 
[00:38:30]  I don't  It does nothing for me, those photos, okay?  The take-a-whiz pics?  No  No, not really  Does it do anything for you?  Nothing more than just seeing the chick naked  Who's doing it  It kind of takes away from her nudity  To tell you the truth  But as part of  As far as being, like, erotic and all that  I don't see anything  Not in the way of that  Not in the way of that  Really taking a leak  I do have a serious question  And mind you  I'm not going to commit to either way on this one 
[00:39:00]  I am really  Well, it's very safe bet on this show  All right, because I'm really confused, okay?  But in the February 2000 issue of penthouse  Starting on page 31  You're confused?  You're supposed to like the way the girls look in America  Well, that's what I'm getting at, Ant  Okay?  All right, let me just spit it out  Is strap-on lesbo sex cool to look at?  Lesbo strap-on sex  Is it cool to look at? 
[00:39:30]  Strap-on lesbo sex  Is it cool?  On the next Jerry Springer  Let me think  Is there a picture of it in there?  Yeah, there's plenty of pictures  All right, well, obviously  I have to thumb through some of the pics  All right, because look  Like the first picture  Here, I'll go through it  I hate when they try to be artsy-fartsy  And do it in black and white  First picture  There's the two hot lesbians  Ready to go, fully dressed, okay?  All right  They're cheek-to-cheek  They're pushing their boobs against each other  Looks like they're going to be 
[00:40:00]  You know, bumping donuts in a minute or two  Going at it  All right  Absolutely  Now the one girl, the blonde  With the huge cans  Is now topless  And the other girl's behind her  And it looks like they want to ride a jet ski together, Anthony  Yeah  Reference to yesterday's show  Yes  And that's pretty hot, right?  Now there they are on the bed  Okay  And now there she's doing her thing there  Right  A little oral  That's all you have to say  Okay 
[00:40:30]  There you go  The how you doing shot  Hey, look at that  Okay  And that's where  I go  Okay  Am I supposed to get into that?  The next picture  Right  Now one of the girls all of a sudden has a  She's giving a hummer  Yeah  To the other girl  That has the apparatus on  Wearing the apparatus  Now, Anthony  The question I have today  Give me that  Give me that  Is strap-on lesbo sex cool?  Yeah  Because then the pictures get very explicit  From that point on 
[00:41:00]  Wow, yeah  Look at that  I'm going to punch myself in the mouth with this mic  Hold on  Hold on  Wait a minute  All right  I guess you haven't committed to anything, Opie?  No  Honestly  I'm definitely confused  Because I don't know what to think  All right  I guess  I'll take the plunge  And go on record  Okay  God damn  That's hot  It's hot 
[00:41:30]  Come on  Look  I see  Yes  I see the photos  Look at this  She's got her legs wrapped around  The other girl  That's not the problem I have, though  What's the problem?  Now, are you being turned on by that part of the act?  Like that?  Well, that it's a chick  I know  They're both a girl  But it's fine  Okay, it's a chick, though  That has the, you know, the apparatus  There's the apparatus on  What if it was like a transsexual?  It was just like 
[00:42:00]  That's completely different  Okay  Oh, my God  No, I'm just putting it all on the table here  For the discussion  Right  I'm not saying either way here  I'm saying you know it's two girls  You see it  You see that it's an apparatus  But that's a guy thing  But it's a sex toy  No, it's more than a sex toy  Because it's not just like a vibrator  That is a guy's thing  You know what I mean?  It's shaped as a guy's thing  Yeah, but it's strapped onto a woman who's using it like that  All right, so you're going to commit  On another woman  Not even using it  Like, if she was using it on a guy 
[00:42:30]  That would be rude  And you'd go  Ew, that's disgusting  Right  It's a girl on a girl  Using the strap-on apparatus  Yes, absolutely  Interesting  Hot to look at pictures  All right, so  Strap-on lesbo sex  Anthony, yes  I'm going to say  I'm going to say yes  All right  Yeah  Now the phones are going nuts  Because we yelled and screamed at Spaz and Rick so long 
[00:43:00]  We have to take another quick break  But we will go right to the phones and discuss  Strap-on lesbo sex real fast  Look at that  Before they throw us off the air  We'll do a couple minutes on it, okay?  That's a balloon knot territory right there  Yeah, I see that  Whoa  All right  We'll be back  If you're on the phones  On hold  Stay right there  The Opie and Anthony Show  I have no clue what anybody's saying  But it's the funniest damn show  More stupidity on the way  1027

A bunch of people on the instant feedback  Calling me a fag and a homophobe and stuff  I didn't say either way  On the strap-on lesbo sex thing  Right  I was just throwing out a question there  Absolutely  I didn't say it was not a turn-on  I didn't say it was a turn-on  I was asking the question 
[00:45:00]  Because I think it's something that other people would wonder about  I say, looking at the pictures  Lesbian strap-on dildo sex  No guy involved  No guy involved  It's two girls  One wearing a strap-on  And then doing the other one  Strap-on lesbo sex  Is it cool?  Now, hot  All right  I say hot  The only question I got  Is you look at the one girl  And you get a little paranoid  Like it might be one of those  You know  He-she's  He-she's 
[00:45:30]  But it's not  I understand that  And you know it's not  So there's not a problem  Okay  And I'm still not saying either way  I'll be honest  It seems like it's a  It's definitely a turn-on  Looking at those pictures  But  There's some issues there  It's still a few  See, like Rick is like  You're totally not into it, right?  Oh, it's okay when it's a chocolate penis  To eat it, Rick  Remember that?  Well, I don't remember seeing that happen  But, you know  If you've got pictures  Let me know  You know 
[00:46:00]  You're looking bad  For a fuck, boy  So, Rick  No, I just don't like it  Because it's still  It's a strap-on dildo  And what do they look like?  They look like a penis  Right  I'm like  It's just a tool  That the girl is using  On another girl  It's rubber  It doesn't matter  I'm not buying it  It still looks like a penis  Hey  Shut up  You live with a gay guy  Yeah, exactly  Como  Gay  Gay  Gay  Psycho Mark 
[00:46:30]  With a very intelligent  Rebuttal to that whole thing  Hey  Let's go have another beer  And a bong hit  Wow  Are you going to start with me now?  Yeah  What did I do to you?  You're abusing us  It sure is  What's wrong with two chicks  With a  I didn't say there's anything wrong with it  I'm just  I'm asking the question today  You sound like a homophobe  I lean toward  It's hot  Yes  But there's definitely  Like a  You know  You've got to give a yes or no answer 
[00:47:00]  Anthony answered  Alright, fine  If I had to  Okay, fine  If I had to  I would say yes  Bag  Yeah  I say it's pretty hot  Okay  It looks hot  It's got nothing to do with the  Actual strap-on utensil  Brian  Hey, how's it going guys?  Alright, what's up?  Just  The whole thing with the lesbo strap-on  It just doesn't work  Like the whole point of seeing  Two lesbians going at it  Is you don't have to look at some  Big creepy Italian guy  Shween for five minutes  Right  But you're 
[00:47:30]  But you're not  But  But it's just  Did he say what I thought he said?  Yeah, I had to dump out of you, man  No, it's  So you say  It's definitely not cool  No, definitely not  Okay  Like when you're looking at two chicks  You want to see some muff diving  Not a big queen  But once it's  In use  You're not seeing it  But then  What it looks like  Then, you know  You're just seeing  Gyration  And grinding  Sometimes it's to get  Like that dog shot, you know 
[00:48:00]  Yeah  It's got the girl behind  It's just like  Wait a second  You're not supposed to be doing that  Yeah, but it looks kind of cool  Why does it look cool?  It's a girl with a shween  That's why I brought it up  It's not the girl with the shween  Whoa  It's the girl with the big black plastic shawl  No, no, no  You've got to understand  What I'm trying to say here  It doesn't  It's not that it's a shween  Right  It is a utensil  There could be a  Small model of a Buick LeSabre  Hanging from the damn thing 
[00:48:30]  You know  It doesn't have to look like a shween  Well, yeah  It could just be  A vibrator looking thing  It could be whatever  Right  But the way she's using it  In these pictures  It looks hot  What am I supposed to say?  No  Ew, look  There's a little rubber thing  She's using to pleasure the other girl  Ew, that's disgusting  Well, you can't downplay it  I mean, it's definitely a  Shween  It's an all-out strap-on  Whatever  All right  Thank you, Brian  Sure, guys  Thanks  Bye  Donnie, you're next 
[00:49:00]  What's up?  Homos  Homos  Homos  All right  Now you have to explain yourself  Yeah, explain yourself  Look, who wants to see a chick with a stick?  If I want to see two babes  I want to see some muff diving  I want to see some tongue  I want to see some nips  I don't want to see a chick with a stick  All right  And don't cut it  That's why I brought it up  I wasn't  All right  Homos, homos, homos  All right, thank you, Donnie  Later, dude  Bye  Anthony, you phallic lover  Maybe in the next penthouse

Good  Yo, I think that's definitely cool  If two girls are willing to do something like that  Why not, you know?  Okay  If they're doing it in front of you  You know, you got to  You wouldn't turn that down  Seeing that, right?  I would definitely check it out  Either way  Yeah, so no doubt  If they're willing to do that  I think those are two girls  That any guy would want to hang out  All right, man  Thank you, Danny  All right

It's all good  Okay  An adamant object  I don't know, because I know you can't say that now 
[00:50:30]  Wait, no, I'm definitely on the side of  I'm trying to play both sides here  I see  Okay, I understand that  You can't go both ways, though  No  Well, some people do  So do all these guys disagree with the double-headed apparatus as well?  Well, I don't  See, I guess why I asked the question  Because they're obviously trying to make it look like a transsexual  A he-she  What?  No, they're not  Is that what you're getting from these pictures?  Are you insane?  We have videos 
[00:51:00]  Go get the video from our office  Dude, they're not trying  With some of those girls with the schlongs  If you didn't see the bottom half of them  You would be convinced they were ladies  Dude, if they were trying to make this look like a he-she  They would not have the black strap-on strap leather thing belted around her  Well, they would try to put the device on using some kind of thing where it looked like it wasn't a strap-on  Well, they'd just go get a real transaction  This is just a hot girl  Look at her, she's hot 
[00:51:30]  They're both really hot  And she's wearing leather strap-on apparatus  Black  But the actual unit thing is white, I guess  Right  Alright  So I don't think they're trying to  Well, that's what I'm just playing, you know, the other side with that  I don't know what they're going for there  I don't know  You know?  Alright, guys  Thank you, man  Can I just say one more thing?  Yeah  I've been listening to you guys since the very beginning that you're here in New York 
[00:52:00]  You guys are great  I've tried to call a couple of times  This is the first time I ever got through it  I'm convinced it's because Rick answered the phone and not spazzed magic retard  Alright, thanks, man  Thanks, guys  Bye  Alright, Benny, you're next  A stupid topic we understand, but we'll move on soon  What's up, Benny?  Hey, what's going on?  Alright  You can go both ways  Because I don't want to see pictures of it  But to see that live is great  See, I've never seen that live  That's the way you've got to go to a basketball party  Yeah, we've seen the egg shooting and things like that 
[00:52:30]  You saw it live, dude  Remember here?  Oh, I forgot about that  Yeah  We can't discuss that, though  Yeah  Because the people involved will get in trouble  Holy cow, wait  Now I've got to say, this is really cool  I forgot all about that  Yeah, remember?  We did see this live  And it was hot  Yeah  Yeah  It was great  But it was not 
[00:53:00]  I don't know nothing  Okay, thank you, Benny  We're talking about that picture  Yeah, because the pictures are also in black and white  And  Yeah  I don't know what  I don't know  Whatever  I don't know  I don't think they're trying to make it look like anything more than two girls  One with a strap on  No, okay  You know what  I don't think they're trying to pull the wool over any of our eyes  No, I was just bringing all angles up here  But I've got to say  I forgot all about that  That's like over a year ago  Yeah  I did see this whole thing live in the studio  And there was nothing homophobic about it 
[00:53:30]  It was unbelievable  Remember?  I forgot all about that  End of discussion  Just going at it  Banger  End of discussion  Right?  Yeah  Oh my God  How could I forget that one?  Ross, what's up?  Hey  I was just going to make that comment  If you couldn't tell me that if those two chicks entered that studio now  And did in front of you what they're doing on those pictures  That you or anybody else would run out of the room screaming 
[00:54:00]  I'm not going to be a homo  No, it's not even that  I just wanted to ask you  You know, how hot is it?  You know, to see that  Are you kidding me?  Incredibly hot  Save me the front seat  You're not going to get an argument from me anymore  I forgot about what we saw over a year ago  Oh my God  All right, Ross  Thank you  Later  Bye  You know what the difference is, though?  Is that last year there were other things that finally led up to that  It wasn't just that  Rick, you're not on our side at this point  You remember what we saw 
[00:54:30]  I remember what I saw  But I remember everything that also led up to it  Which is like, all right, that's cool  Just take the last five minutes we saw  If it was just the last five minutes, I'd be like, all right  I'll watch  Oh, man  I don't know  Dutch  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Listen  Is it the act or what?  Because, like, everybody watches heterosexual  Well, I think most of us do  What probably, yeah  What's the  Yeah, well, every other scene in heterosexual porn  Is like the guy's stuff like plowing the girl, you know? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah  I mean, does that make me a homo if I'm watching heterosexual porn?  No, but I just  I just don't get into the bobshot and all that crap  And the regular porno anyway  Yeah, I hear you  I know  Every time they show up for, like, 20 minutes  It's like, okay, already  Show the girl's face or something, you know?  Right  It gets pretty big  Hey, guys, have a good New Year  All right, man, you too  Later  Bye  Someone's saying you wouldn't mind it so much opiate  If it was two pregnant grandmas pounding it  I'd watch that  I'd watch that  Freak show 
[00:55:30]  Robert, what's up?  I used to go out with a girl  And she used to show me these tapes she had  She used to have sex with other girls  Now, the girl I went out with wasn't really that hot  But, like, some of the girls she did  And I wasn't, like, too into it at first  But when I saw it, I was just like, holy cow  I mean, it's like  You know, it's like  It's like if you watch a regular porno  I mean, you know, like a regular guy and girl  It's just that it's just two girls, you know?  So, I mean, if anyone, you know  Doesn't think that that's turn-on  Like a turn-on  Then definitely they're a fact  All right, thank you, Robert 
[00:56:00]  You're welcome  Bye  And, Artie, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  All right  I tell you what  I agree with Opie  Lesbian or no lesbian  They all yearn for the pipe  That's just the way it is  You know what I mean?  Good way to look at it  Personally, I can't stand it  I think it's a slap in our face  Really?  But if pipe is to be laid, I'll lay it  All right, man  Thank you, Artie  You guys rule  All right, bye  It's a personal insult, I guess  Well, you can look for yourself  Yeah, February issue of Pet House, Hent House 
[00:56:30]  It's there  Looks hot  All right, we've got to talk to this girl  Jill  Hi  Hi  How's it doing?  You sound all worked up  Am I?  Yeah  I just walked in the door from work  That's why  You've been listening to this discussion?  Yes, I have  I see what you want to say  So you've got to kind of be careful  How you say it, okay?  How do you mean?  Well, don't be too descriptive  Okay  All right?  All right  Go ahead  Let's see, how can I say this? 
[00:57:00]  I think the turn-on is both  In the lesbian action  And also in the penetration part  And I think putting the two together  Is what makes it that much better  Yeah  So  Do you ever do it?  No  Are you a lesbian?  No, I'm not  But you would check out the pictures in Pet House, let's say  And you'd be pretty turned on, or what?  I'm a big fan of pornos  Uh-huh  I like to watch them  But  I like watching lesbian pornos also  But I've never actually had a lesbian experience 
[00:57:30]  Even though I'm kind of intrigued, but  Well, you could be a lesbian for a day  Right here on the Opie and Anthony show  Could I really?  Yeah, we do it all the time  We haven't done one in the new year yet  Oh, wow  And the next one I think we're doing is a limo ride around Manhattan  Oh, my God  How can I turn that down?  Are you hot?  I don't know  All right, describe yourself a little bit  Um, oh boy  5'8", reddish-brown hair  Um, brown eyes 
[00:58:00]  What else would you like to know?  Measurements  Well, we got your head  Head is okay  Um  Your head passes  Okay  How about your neck?  My neck?  Um, not sure  I haven't really measured my neck  Okay, a little lower then?  Um, I can tell you my bra size  I might scare you guys a little bit  Why?  Why?  Yeah  38 double day  38 double day  On a 5'8", girl  That's pretty hot  Getting raves  That's very hot 
[00:58:30]  Getting raves here in the studio  Oh, good  Can I go down now a little lower?  Waist?  Waist, I don't really know  But I would say like 32, 34, something like that  Okay  Those are some birking hips  And then probably  And then what's your hips?  Um, 34, 36, something like that  Wait a minute  The waist to the hips ain't much of a difference, huh?  So you're shaped like a rectangle  Yeah  Is that what you're saying? 
[00:59:00]  Well  Yeah, it's kind of like  Well, did you hear?  I told you I never really measured  I'm giving a guess, boys  Guys  How much do you weigh?  Yeah, how much do you weigh?  5'8", how many pounds?  150  5'8", 150  It's 5'8", though  Yeah, a buck and a half  5'8", let me think  I'm a big girl  You're a big girl  I'll tell you  I'm just barely 5'9",  And how much do you weigh?  165  Hmm, okay  I'm trying to figure this out 
[00:59:30]  There's a lot of weight in the boobs, I'm imagining  Yeah  You got a big ass?  Not really  No?  It's not little, but it's not big  All right  What are you, just a big girl?

Yeah, it's my turn  But you want to do the strap-on thing?  Definitely  This might have to be one of those off-the-air bids that we put on the internet  See, my thing is that I'm graduating from college in May 
[01:00:30]  Uh-huh  So I'm figuring all my car messing stuff have to get out before then  All right  So I've got about five months left  All right, well, Susie  Yeah  What do you look like?

Uh, yeah  Have you heard any of our lesbian for a day shows yet?  Well, no  My boyfriend got me into the show  And he told me about it 
[01:02:30]  That's pretty hot  Yeah, that's what I heard  We gave you guys the opportunity to be a lesbian for a day  A lot of you girls out there, you know  Wondering what it's like  We have a lesbian couch  You come in here with a complete stranger  And you pick one out that you like  And then we'll see if there's any type of chemistry  Really?  Well, that sounds like fun  You've never kissed a girl before?  I've kissed a girl before  But, you know, like  It hasn't really gone too far, though  So you want to get a little further into it?

[01:03:30]  So I can make arrangements to wash their feet  Because the direction that the show has gone in  Since you guys have changed hands  And cleaned up shop over there  Has just been a beautiful thing  Yeah  Well, we definitely feel a little better about things  I can hear it, man  And I think everybody else probably can, too  Yeah, we do  We feel more comfortable here  Every day  In the studio  Doing our show  Instead of trying to fit into some mold  We've won some battles lately 
[01:04:00]  Yeah  With upper management  We're very happy with how things are going thus far  Rock and roll  So you've got a couple of cans of beer on the console  And somebody's head bumping underneath, right?

[01:04:30]  Yeah  All right, as we go to break  We're real late here  You're a pisser, man  What?  What?  That was you  That was you  Susie's a lovely girl  All right  As we go to break here  A lot of requests for Burger  The terrorist comic  Yes  Turns out one of the hijackers over there in India  Was cracking jokes  Cracking jokes in between killing people  Killing people while they're puking and stuff on that 
[01:05:00]  On that plane for six or seven days  Yeah  So here it is from the other day  Did you read that story?  Yeah, that's why  About the one hijacker named Burger  Burger  And he was like a real nice guy  He'd be all fun  Wait  And joking with the hostages  Was he Indian?  I think so  What a cruel joke that is  My name is Burger  But seriously, folks  Try the meal 
[01:05:30]  We'll all be here all week  So Burger, one of the hostages, right?  He was one of the hijackers  He was one of the hijackers  Take my cat, please  All right  He was one of the hijackers  And he was like  The hostages were describing him  As this really nice guy  Who would joke  He was telling jokes  Did you hear about the man in the helicopter?  This is one of his jokes  The man in the helicopter  Who asked  Turn the big fan off  I'm getting cold 
[01:06:00]  Everyone knows that's a Polish joke  But yeah, I guess he didn't want to offend anybody  He's got a gun to people's heads  But they said, yeah  He would joke around like that  And then the next second  If negotiations broke down  He'd say  Well, I'm going to kill all of you  And the people freaked out  They didn't know what to think of this guy  And at one point  They took a bunch of hostages up front  And slit some guy's throat  Killed him  Threw him off the plane  So they meant business  But then some of them were like  Oh, he was the nicest guy  He'd come by and pass out food 
[01:06:30]  He was like good cop, bad cop  All wrapped up in one  Right  The puke plane  The puke plane  That must have been something  When all of a sudden  The engines just went  And the fan stopped blowing  I was reading all that coverage  Yeah  I mean, I've been on a runway  For like two hours  And I thought I was going to die  You know what I mean?  Yeah  I mean, you're just trapped in a plane  And there's babies crying  And there's a big fat sweaty guy  Sitting next to you  Whatever  You know the deal  People are puking  Ugh  And then the body odor 
[01:07:00]  They said was just unbearable  And that's why  Everyone was puking on top of that  Like you said  Just when you're stuck on the runway  For a little while  You know  And a little while being  Even up to an hour  And you're just so agitated  And you just want off  And it stinks  Next time that happens  You're going to think about  This damn last situation  You could be with burger  But you know  I got to tell you folks  Does it stink in here or what?  Come on lady, smile  Wipe the puke off your face  Did it stink like this 
[01:07:30]  Before everyone started to puke?  I've been in some of your houses  Oh, puke  What's grosser than gross?  This plane  What are you kidding?  You're all weak  Opie and Anthony  Cunnilingus and psychiatry  Brought us to this  On FM Talk  At 1027  The Talk  You can't ignore  1027 
[01:08:00]  WNAW  It's Opie and Anthony  Hey Matt  I guess we should admit it finally  We're just kind of goofing off today  Yeah, why not?  Having fun though  Hope you're enjoying the festivities  We've got to clear something up  For all those knuckleheads  On the New York Radio Message Board  We talk about the New York Radio Message Board  From time to time, right Anthony?  Far too much, I think  But why not?  They talk about us a lot  It's basically this website 
[01:08:30]  Where all these radio freaks  Discuss the most stupidest things  About New York Radio  Yeah  Like with everything going on  In New York Radio  Or everything you think  Would be going on  In the number one radio market  They discuss like  The lamest crap  Whatever happened to  And then they throw out  Like call letters  Of a station  I never heard of in my life 
[01:09:00]  Right  You know  WNBC jingles  From 1985  Where can I find them?  What?  So they're having  A really big  Huge discussion today  On the New York Radio Message Board  God, these people  Have to get lives  They have to get lives  They're discussing  NEW once again  Yeah  See, the other day  Ant and I  Went on the radio  And we said  You know what?  We're sick of FM talk  At 1027  It does make sense 
[01:09:30]  It's stupid  It doesn't roll off the tongue  It doesn't roll off the tongue  It means nothing  So Ant and I  Took it upon ourselves  To, you know  Just dump  FM talk  1027  Get rid of it  It's called  1027  WNEW  I don't care  What is going on  At this radio station  But at 1027  It's going to always be  WNEW  In the minds of  True New Yorkers  Right  You know  Famous call letters  The most famous call letters  In America  I must say  At least FM  Call letters  Okay 
[01:10:00]  So honestly  This is how it started  The other day  We just said  You know what?  FM talk  1027  Is just plain stupid  Yeah  And Ant and I said  You know  From now on  On our radio show  We are not going to say  FM talk  1027 anymore  Yeah  We're going to start saying  1027  WNEW  Absolutely  Because that's what this place is  Simple as that  Alright  Yeah  And I applaud  The radio chick  She took our lead  And she decided  The same thing  Yes  Bravo  And that's the only other radio show  I listen to here  So I don't know what else is going on 
[01:10:30]  But I know  Yeah  Okay  So  Now they're discussing today  How schizophrenic we are  Because  Like  Some of  Some of the jocks  Are saying 1027  WNEW  And then there's  But they're still playing sweepers  That say  FM talk  1027  What's going on over there?  This is what they're discussing  It's okay  It's okay  It's  A little transition phase  You dopes 
[01:11:00]  It's a transitional period  Of course  Thank you Anthony  We have so many  Production elements  They're called  Hundreds of them  That just because  The other day  Ant and I said  You know  We don't want to be called  FM talk  1027  You know  It's going to take everyone  At least a week  I would say  To get rid of all the old  Production elements  Yeah  To get on the  WNEW website  And get rid of all the  FM talk  1027 logos  And that is what is going on here  End of discussion  You know 
[01:11:30]  The  Read one of the things  They read about  They post about this  Under the title of  Identity crisis  At 1027  Yeah  This guy  This guy  Charles  Must have spent  Oh my god  An hour  Composing this  Oh my god  It started last week  Uh  NEW  Turning into  FM talk  The  Rock of the  Millennium special

[01:17:30]  The radio message board dentist  Who's also  Who's also  Gene Dixon  Because he does make  Those predictions  Anthony  All the time  He predicted  One of his biggest predictions  For 2000  Is  Opie and Anthony  Will be doing mornings  Will  Will be doing mornings  Will be  And let me tell you why  He says  Yeah  Because if they want him  To do mornings  They will do mornings  They have no choice  In the matter  Do you think Opie and Anthony  Wield enough power  That they could say no  To their bosses  If their bosses say 
[01:18:00]  You're doing mornings  Hey Alan  We could quit  We could just leave  Yeah  We were hired for afternoons  We enjoy it here  And if we were offered mornings  And if we didn't want to do  We're not going to do  They're not going to force us  To do something  We don't want to do  And let's say  You had to fill a tooth  Alan  Right  There's a little cavity  In one of the bicuspids  Okay  And someone just comes over 
[01:18:30]  And tells you  Do a root canal  Or just pull the tooth  You would say no  I'm a dentist  I know what I'm doing  I'm just going to fill it  You know  You don't have to  Yank the tooth out  We're not doing mornings  We're not  We're not  Stop it  We're not stupid  There's no competition  Afternoons  We know that  We know that  Jesus Christ  Even a paraplegic  Could win a marathon  If no one else is running 
[01:19:00]  We're not stupid  We're not stupid  Is right  What do we got  Bob Grant  You know  Mike and the Mad Dog  Right  Come on  There's nothing going on  In the afternoon  We're comfy here  Mike and the Mad Dog  Discussing the Jets situation  For 40 straight hours  Let's say  That Tony was on Mars  Alright  Let's say  There was a football team  On the Mars  You tell you this  They have to just find 
[01:19:30]  Their stories  Over there now  We're not doing mornings  No  We're staying right here  The rock and roll dentist  Is wrong on this prediction  The radio dentist  No  Call him the rock and roll dentist  I wonder if he's like  A program director  At his office  And like he programs  The music that you hear  Alright  I'm going to need some Bach  And that  And then later on  In the afternoon  I think we might go  To something heavier  Like some Beethoven  For some of the younger patients  That might come in 
[01:20:00]  Oh  Too funny  Hey Rich  What's going on  Hey guys  I got a question for you  I do a lot of posting  On different boards  On the internet  Can you give out  The web address  So we can go on  And start doing  Some goof posts on it  Well we don't want to  We don't want to  F the guy up  Because if you're just  Going to post like  Curses or something  Then he takes them off  And it's just a pain  In the ass for him  And we don't want to  Do that  I mean if you've got  Something fun to post  About the radio dentist  And stuff  That would be funny  Yeah I'd like to do  If you want to go  If you want to go  Out of your way  I'll make it real easy 
[01:20:30]  If you know the  Unofficial website address  Sure  Under the link section  There's a link  To the New York  Radio message  Okay I mean  I ain't going to post  Nothing done  Just maybe something  A little funny  Doofing on him  No one's even better  Than posting  Is just reading  Some of the real posts  On there  You'll laugh your butt off  These guys' lives  Are this pathetic  That they're actually  Sitting down  And thinking of this stuff  They had a whole discussion  A while back  They truly believed  That what should happen  To WNEW  The legendary  1027 WNEW 
[01:21:00]  This should turn into  A standard station  Yeah  Standards  Standards  Standards  Because I want him  To do a cleaning  On my girlfriend's mouth  After he gets me  A rusty trombone  You know  Because I don't want  To be kissing that  Unless he can go in there  And you know  Do the old  Well Opie and I  Are starting the  New York dentist  Message board  As a matter of fact  We're going to start  Critiquing some of  Alan's work  Oh and one more thing  Paul's still a packer  Alright  Oh very good 
[01:21:30]  From yesterday  Thank you Rich  Goodbye  Alright  It's just amazing though  And 99% of the people  That post to the  New York radio  Message board  The legit posters  Yeah  Absolutely hate  Ant and I  And want us to go away  Oh yeah  They want us gone  In the worst way  And every time  Our ratings like  Drop like a couple  Tenths of a point  During like a  Trend they're called  We get like  Ratings every month  Basically  They're all over the place  See  See  I told you  They were just a fad  It's just a matter  Of time  Before they're gone  And we'll have  Our classic rock pack  On NEW  What are you laughing at 
[01:22:00]  They got posts  All over it now  Yeah  So I wrote  Dopey and Anthony  Ha ha ha  You rule  You know  Stop reading this board  Then if you have  A problem with this board  We don't have a problem  With the board  We love the board  We don't have a problem  We laugh  It's fun to read  You know  Ant and I  You know  We consider ourselves  Comedians  But we can't even  Match up  To the comedic  Stylings  Of these people  Posting on the  New York radio  Message board  They're starting 
[01:22:30]  A new rumor  On the New York  Radio message board  As I speak  Ant  Yeah  WNEW is going  To be  O&A all day  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Very good  That was from Ziggy  All right  And we gotta  Take a break  All right  But it's just  Hilarious  It's so stupid  Keep writing  Your nasty posts  About us  We really don't  Care  Sometimes I think  I think Alan slipped  And shot the  Novocaine  Directly into his  Brain  We do like him 
[01:23:00]  Though  I mean  He's gotta be  A fun guy  To run a radio  Message board  If you're a dentist  You need a sense  Of humor  He's actually  Had an open  Mind about our  Show from the  Beginning  I appreciate  That much  About it  Imagine like  You go to get  Your dentist  Your tooth drilled  And you're  Opie or Anthony  And you sit  In the dentist  Chair  And you realize  He goes  Hi  I'm  I'm Alan  Sniffen  It's like  Mike you're next 
[01:23:30]  What's going on  Oh my teeth  That noise  My eyes are watering  Oh my god  I swear to god  I feel like  I'm actually  Stinging that shit  Just hearing it  Over the radio  You know what that is  That's actually  One of these  In fast motion  Oh my god  I can't believe it  I feel it  Like at the bottom  Of my teeth  I can't take the pace  Yeah isn't that bad  It works with a  Car starter  Too

[01:25:00]  P.R. pants man  I'm telling you  I haven't laughed that hard  In so long  The commercials were playing  And we went to the  New York radio message board  We just did 20 minutes  On how stupid  The New York radio message board is  You can find the link  Through the unofficial  Opie and Anthony website  In the link section  But they discuss  The most mundane  And stupidest things  About New York radio  On this message board  Yeah  And they're like  Purist to the radio  Yeah they would 
[01:25:30]  Radio field  They would love  If all broadcasting  Went back to the way  It was in the 50's  I think  You know  You just  You play your songs  You give your time  And weather checks  And then you're back  Into songs  Correct  Makes you a great job  Correct  Yeah  That's what they want  But you know  They have us in New York  To talk about  So they bash us  So we pretty much  Trashed the New York  Radio message board  And pretty much  You know  Explained how  Everyone who posts on there  Are a bunch of tools 
[01:26:00]  There's a couple of good people  And we  And we  And we  We begged our listeners  To be intelligent  And you know  If you want to check out  The New York radio message board  For yourself  Through the link section  Of the unofficial website  To be nice and stuff  Right  Of course  You freaking bastards  It's hysterical  I gotta stress  Once again  They take it really seriously  On this New York radio message board  Yes  They're very pure  With their radio  Why don't you read  Some of the postings  That have made  The New York radio message board

[02:06:00]  Yeah  It's kind of like a car wreck on an alley.  You're going to have to, you know, take a sense to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So don't screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  One, two, seven.  One, two, seven.  WNNW. 
[02:06:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  People enjoying the...  What?  I hate the bed music.  What?  Like, I like it right at first, but then, like, fade out.  Yeah, it just...  Oh, God, it goes on forever.  There are some, like, best of bits that I listen to over vacation.  Yeah.  Crank that up.  Crank the music up.  Well, I've got to get another one, because that's fading. 
[02:07:00]  I've got another one.  Like, one that's really loud?  Yeah.  All right.  And I'll kind of describe to you what some of these phone calls sound like when they...  You pop right into a phone call.  Louder.  Make it louder.  So you're trying to say the bed is too loud on some of those old tapes? 
[02:07:30]  What?  Yeah.  Well.  Well, and then I've heard from other people that say, like, I guess the machinery here  at the station equals it out.  So, uh, no?  From what Rick is saying?  It does it on the microphone.  Right.  But not on another CD.  Okay, that's it.  Which is what we have everything burned on.  Right.  And if, like, a phone call comes through.  Right.  Or something.  But for our mics, it's okay.  But in our headphones, we hear the music loud.  So, now, here is what the listener hears when it's just us talking. 
[02:08:00]  So, play it real low.  Hey, what's up?  It's Opie and Anthony.  How you doing today?  Because, like, it's cranking in our headphones.  And we think it's loud, but it really is.  But it equals out as it comes out of your speakers at home.  Gotcha.  Stacy, you're next.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Talking to you.  Not to throw a wrench in the whole threesome conversation, but, uh, I think that it's okay  to fool around, but intercourse, I don't really think that that's necessary with a third 
[02:08:30]  person.  There's other things that could be done.  Intercourse.  Yeah, I don't really care.  Intercourse.  It's just too personal, especially when you're married.  Well, it's not like the main goal if I'm in a threesome.  Exactly.  That's what I wanted to hear.  See, that's not fair to you guys, right?  No, I'm serious.  What's your main goal?  Just that it's two chicks.  Right?  Shouldn't that be enough?  I get to pop one and feel around with the other.  I'm happy.  Yeah, without a doubt.  I don't need to pop two.  There you go. 
[02:09:00]  That's what I was looking to hear.  I hope my husband's listening.  If I pop the two, then that's an extra bonus, but it's not like I'm going away, you know,  mad or sad because I only popped one and got to feel around with the other one.  It's like a football game.  Good terminology, guys.  All right, take it easy.  You change end zones.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Uh, Eric, what's going on?  Hey, Owen.  How you guys doing?  What's up, man?  Hey, listen, I'm a big fan of threesomes.  Okay.  But I'm a way bad fan of threesomes when it comes to your wife or your girlfriend.  All right, why?  About seven years ago, my wife comes up to me and she says, uh... 
[02:09:30]  What if it's your wife and girlfriend?  Well, that might not be bad.  Yeah, but about seven years ago, my wife comes up to me and she's like, uh, wanting to do a threesome for my birthday.  I'm like, why is everyone shaking their head?  I'm just trying to...  Well, I'm like, this is great.  I had like three years...  You guys know something I don't?  All right, Eric, go ahead.  I'm very distracted.  Everyone's shaking their head in here.  Yeah, tell me to shut the hell up.  All right.  Well, I had like...  This was like seven years ago.  So I had like three years, like the best memory?  Yeah.  Well, like about three years ago, my wife comes up to me and she says, remember that threesome that we did? 
[02:10:00]  I'm like, yeah.  She's like, well, I'd like to do it again.  I'm like, this is great.  She wanted to do it with a guy, though.  Uh-oh.  I'm like, what, are you high?  You know, never, ever, ever, never, ever, never, ever.  Well, that's the opinion of your pal's O&A, but we heard...  I've been divorced two and a half years because of it.  We've heard from a lot of guys out there that they don't mind doing abroad with their buddy.  She held that over your head?  Yeah, she held it over my head. 
[02:10:30]  That's what...  When that other guy called, I had to call.  All right, wait, wait, wait.  Since I got you a chick, you've got to let me have a guy?  I mean, she was nice enough to give me a choice of, like, three of my friends.  And because you wouldn't do the threesome with...  The choice of three of your friends.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  She gives me a choice.  She's like, you can have these three, but not these two.  And I'm like, uh-huh.  I'm like, what, are you high?  No.  What, are you high?  I like people working that into their conversation, Ann.  Very good.  Go ahead.  It sounds like there might have been other problems in the marriage, sir.  Yeah, there was.  She ended up going and doing a threesome with two other guys. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  Oh, really?  She came back and told me about it.  She told me that I wouldn't do it, so she wanted to experience it that way.  Do you miss the bitch?  Only when I'm driving.  But I'll pump.  The other day, she ran across the street, and I missed her.  All right, all right.  Hey, you guys, you rule, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Wow.  Kim has a butt.  She would do a threesome, but.  Kim?  Oh, just a butt.  Okay.  Hey, my hope, I have a big problem with threesomes.  All right.  Basically, I would do it, but I don't want to do it with somebody that I love, like my boyfriend. 
[02:11:30]  You know what I mean?  Like the thought or the sight of him kissing another girl would piss me off.  You know?  It wouldn't turn me on.  I would be angry and jealous.  Really?  Like, okay, you and your wife and some other girl.  Well, I guess it's different for guys, but, you know, she's like making out with some other girl. 
[02:12:00]  Are you going to be jealous?  No.  All right.  Well, that was my whole point.  I would just be jealous.  I wouldn't want to do it with somebody I loved, basically.  Know where my jealousy would come in?  Where?  And I got to stress, I would not do this, but, I don't know, let's, because I always get in trouble for putting my foot in my mouth.  Let's say I was talked into a threesome where it was another guy.  But it's not going to happen, but this, that's... 
[02:12:30]  But you, but you see my point.  Oh, wait!  With a...  No, no, wait.  Ass wipe.  Can we see your stuff?  Another guy, another girl, obviously talking about the relationship I'm in.  You're such an idiot.  You can't even be hypothetical on this show.  You know how it works.  Eye pants down.  Eye pants down.  Eye pants down.  That's where the jealousy would come in, though, if I was involved with a threesome with my girlfriend and another guy, even though I said it wouldn't happen, but if I saw my girlfriend making out with another guy, I'd have a problem with that. 
[02:13:00]  Right, that's what I'm saying.  If I was with two guys...  Wait, you know, you guys could all laugh and stuff, but I could go to the phones and talk to a hundred guys that had a threesome with another guy.  I know, we've talked about that.  And they swear it's...  And they swear they're straight and stuff.  I personally don't want to do it.  It was a hypothetical situation, blah, blah, blah.  But you understand what I'm saying.  Yeah, but if I was in a threesome with my girlfriend and another girl and they were making out, I wouldn't be jealous in the least. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Now I'm screwed for the next month.  Thanks.  Yeah, whatever.  I'm a fag giving it to your sister, Craig.  That's right.  Oh, man.  She loves gay guys.  Ah, Moses.  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  She's a fag hag.  Well, you see, my girlfriend, she would like to tie with another girl. 
[02:14:00]  Uh-huh.  But I know also that, you know, before we talked and she said that she was with another guy, that would also, you know, that would also be good for her.  But if I were another girl, I wouldn't even be able to touch her because then she would want to be with another guy and I can't deal with that.  I couldn't let her.  Okay.  I mean, if I see her with another guy, I could never touch her again.  That would feel really weird.  I mean, what if she runs away with the other guy who doesn't like me no more?  God damn it. 
[02:14:30]  I'm distracted because everyone's on the phones now abusing me.  Of course they are.  All right.  Thank you, Moses.  All right.  Bye.  Might as well play it out.  John.  Yeah.  Hey, yo.  Yeah.  Hypothetically, you're a homo.  Hands down.  You're such a homo.  I can't believe you just put your foot in your mouth.  No, I...  You might as well forget it.  That's the best Florida guy.  All right, John.  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Hey, guys, it's rolled.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Let's say I was at the glory hall.  Shut up.  Right?  J.D.  And I'm on my knees.  Oh, you've got so many issues.  Why do I have issues?  You're having a lot of problems today.  Why?  You've got to just keep your mouth shut.  I know.  I'm not coming off real bad for that.  I'm not explaining myself well for that.  One more quick thing about my buddy Rick?  Yeah.  All that aggression, that fighting with men stuff?  That's gay.  That's gay, too.  He just likes to touch guys.  He can't wait to wrestle. 
[02:15:30]  He loves...  He can't wait to...  He loves...  He must love the crotch hold.  Oh.  Actually, his crotch...  What's his move?  His crotch was on my face.  Oh.  Well, there you go.  He loves it.  Oh, my God.  Beautiful.  A little too much information.  I don't know if I were you like being at a...  After all the hypothetical things that are happening.  Before or after the show.  Psycho Mark in the studio.  Psycho Mark, what?  His crotch was in my face.  We're going to isolate that for months. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, that's a good clip.  I hear a Ricky Martin song coming on.  Thank you, JD.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Was he shaking his bonbon at you?  Yeah, both of them.  Freak!  All right, man.  So, Mark, why do you live with a gay guy?  Because I'm not afraid to.  That's why.  I'm just asking.  That's all.  Look at the position marks in there.  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[02:16:30]  Everything's gay in this video.  Yeah, this is getting a little too gay, man.  I am.  Tell you the truth.  All right.  There's another scenario for me.  This could be good.  Hello?  Yeah, hi.  Oh, here we go.  Okay, Hopi, you're in a bar hanging out with a buddy of yours.  Yeah.  Right?  And you both meet the same girl.  She goes, I want to take you back home and do both of you.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  Besides putting my foot in my mouth, I'd have a real tough time doing that.  You wouldn't take her.  It could be the highest girl in the world, and you wouldn't take her home with you. 
[02:17:00]  So she wants to do you and your buddy at the same time.  Can we be in, like, separate rooms or something?  No, no, no, no.  She wants two guys.  And she's a stranger.  You don't know her.  You're not in love with her.  All kidding aside, Ant and I have discussed this, and both of us said, no way.  We wouldn't be able to do it.  All right.  Now you're making it sound like we discussed it because of the opportunity.  No, no, not for us.  No, no, no, no, no.  You absolutely made it sound that way.  We don't have to explain everything on the show.  No, we have this.  Dude, you totally made it sound like that.  All right.  But, I mean, no, this topic came up, and if I was in this situation with another person that happens to be a male and a girl, 
[02:17:30]  and the girl was hot, I don't think I could do it.  But there was a bunch of guys that called up laughing, saying, what's the big deal?  I didn't.  It was no problem.  Might as well just get into pornos.  Get paid for.  All right, Lou.  What the hell?  All righty.  All right.  This is getting a little too gay, this whole conversation, getting a little gay. 
[02:18:00]  Where's the norm clip?  We've got to end this segment with the norm clip.  Yeah, absolutely.  We'll take one more abuse call from me while we find the norm clip.  Frank, what's up?  I knew it.  You were on the jet ski with Ricky Martin.  I knew it.  That's out of the bag.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  You're welcome.  All right.  All these idiots coming up with scenarios.  Steve, you're next.  What's up?  I'll be, if you were in bed with two hot babes and one of them pulled out a strap on, how would 
[02:18:30]  you feel about that?  I was laughing his ass on that.  Ah, you just got to be here when someone puts their foot in their mouth.  It's just not fun.  You put your own foot in your mouth two times today.  I know.  Oh, thank you, Steve.  What's the instant feedback saying there, Ant?  Anything good on there?  Oh, there's nothing on the instant feedback.  Joe.  Just for people.  Hey.  Hey.  Using Opie.  What's up?  Besides the fact that you're putting your foot in your mouth, I guess you got other things 
[02:19:00]  going in your mouth, too.  Come on.  Rick Trach.  There's no way to win this.  Where is that?  Como.  Thank you.  Where is that?  Norm.  We're trying to find Norm.  Yeah, yeah.  Gay.  There's a girl on the line, Donna, who supports me, hopefully.  There you go.  Donna?  Hi, Opie.  Hi.  I support you.  Okay.  I understand when you say that you would be mad if you were still a guy kissing your  girl.  That's how the girl, that girl that was on the phone, that's what she meant when she  said that.  Right.  I know.  It's like you don't want somebody else kissing what's yours or whatever, but it still 
[02:19:30]  is funny when you're a fag.  Bye.  Thank you, Donna.  I think I made my point somewhere in there, hopefully somewhere.  If not, screw y'all.  I hate you all.  If all y'all.  I hate all y'all.  All right.  We'll end with our favorite clip that we've played a million times, and we'll be back  with more of the Opie and Anthony show.  Have you ever done anything in your long and storied career that you consider specifically 
[02:20:00]  to be in bad taste?  Did you look back on it?  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think  that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are, like one time I was doing  this thing in San Francisco, and there were all gay people in the audience, they told me,  so I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to me.  Yeah, it's more about it.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it  there were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our 
[02:20:30]  gay son, you know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know?  Because it's not an achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men are actually  bragging, you know, at work, like, hey, Bill, you know, my kid, oh my God, we're proud  of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean? 
[02:21:00]  And now he's articling over at a law firm, and, oh yeah, he loves cock.  He can't get enough cock in his mouth, his ass, his kid's always cock.  I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's cock.  I want to show him to him.  This one is called Gerbil. 
[02:21:30]  I bought a Gerbil at the petting zoo.  If Richard Gere can do it, I can, too.  I get undressed, I start to lube.  I stick the Gerbil in the end of the tube.  Wondering just how he'll feel.  Will he like it better than his little wheel?  Careful now, he's right beside me.  One more inch and he's inside me. 
[02:22:00]  Go!  Gerbil, go!  Burrow harder, burrow deeper.  Be my little chimney sweeper.  One thing I forgot about.  How am I supposed to get you out? 
[02:22:30]  So now my Gerbil's on Easy Street.  It's warm and cozy and there's plenty to eat.  The situation is beyond my control.  Gotta find a way to get him out of his hole.  I try crowbars, I try wires.  I almost hurt him with a pair of pliers.  I try cheese, but he's not biting. 
[02:23:00]  I wish this wasn't so exciting.  Go!  Gerbil, go!  Jesus, I am such a sucker.  Please get out, you furry.  I think I am getting ill.  Suddenly, he's very, very still.  Now it's too late, my Gerbil died. 
[02:23:30]  I guess I have committed Gerbil's side.  Here's some advice.  It's very clear cut.  If you love your Gerbil,  don't stick him up your butt.  Don't stick him up your butt.  Little fairy Gerbil in your booty hole. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  Wow.  The Gerbil song.  All right.  Thank you.  The only time you'll ever hear that on the radio.  Hope you taped it.  That's the end of it, Gerbil.  You're on the Anthony Show.  Crone men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  Terrific.  One-oh-two-seven-W-N-A-W. 
[02:24:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  And every day, our support stops by.  Oh, yeah.  Today, it's Steve from the unofficial website  and Sick Boy from xwrestling.com.  Sick Boy going to be in studio tomorrow  to help us out with the Rock interview.  Rock coming into the studio tomorrow, Anthony.  How excited are you?  Finally, the Rock has come back.  Well, he's never been here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll probably say it anyway.  Yeah, he probably will. 
[02:25:00]  You know what?  I just pray he comes in character.  I just pray.  Because it was...  I mean, I'm a huge Mankind fan.  And when they were in Jersey  and we had him on the ISDN line,  we were so excited.  We thought he was going to be in character.  We were going to have so much fun with him.  And he was just like regular McFoley.  And it was such a letdown.  We were so bummed.  Well, some people are fun when they're out of character.  Like Al Snow.  Yeah, Al Snow.  Very funny just being Al Snow.  The second time around was really good.  Real good.  Jericho, in character, knew how to play the game. 
[02:25:30]  Goddamn fun.  You know, we get requests for that damn Chris Jericho interview  every single day.  We should replay it.  We get emails about it asking to put it up on the site.  Oh, really?  You know what I heard?  And like about, God, maybe a month after we did that,  he was on with Kane, I guess, over at K-Rock.  Just awful.  It's like, how can you fail with Jericho?  I mean, the guy is on all the time.  And he was on.  He was trying.  But it was obvious Kane was too cool to even be talking to him. 
[02:26:00]  All those guys over there, they're too cool for the room.  Too cool for the room.  Exactly.  So we couldn't even have fun with them right now.  I'm on K-Rock.  That's all that matters.  I don't even need to try to do a radio show.  I'm just too cool.  I don't want anyone to even think I stopped by wrestling even while I'm just flipping  through the channels.  You know what I mean?  Can't be bothered.  I couldn't know anything about that.  Shane's doing VH1 now, too.  So that sort of doubles up.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But did we replay the Chris Jericho interview during Worst Of?  I don't remember.  I think... 
[02:26:30]  We did?  Let's find it for tomorrow.  We had requested it, but I don't think it ever got on.  We've got to find the Chris Jericho.  And the funny thing is, Ant and I have to take the credit for the change in hairstyle of  Chris Jericho.  Oh, we don't completely take credit for that.  The sperm fountain.  We said it looked like a sperm fountain on top of his head.  Absolutely.  We made so many homo references to the poor guy.  And the next time he was on Raw, his hair was completely different.  Yeah.  He pulled it way back down on the back of his head. 
[02:27:00]  It wasn't sticking up on top.  I think I called him Pebble Splintstone.  Yeah.  It's like the next time you saw him, it was down.  We definitely have to take credit for that.  Have to.  Oh, man.  But it's going to be something having the rock in here.  Yeah.  Maybe Rick could piss him off and he could...  Fight club.  You know, give him the rock bottom.  And then the people's elbow on Rick's head.  Sweet.  That would be amazing.  Or maybe Spaz can get the people's elbow.  There you go.  Oh, wait a minute.  I just remembered something.  In the Raw article that you and I did?  Yeah.  Didn't I say that I wanted the people's elbow to my forehead? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, you did say that.  Oh, no.  That's right, January 2000 issue of Raw featuring ONA.  All news fans now.  Absolutely.  We'll buy it.  We'll bring that up.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I went on record in that magazine as saying I thought Rock was one of the funniest, most  entertaining of the WWF.  Because they might have the magazine.  He's got it.  Because he's just funny.  I mean, to see him this past, what was that, Raw?  Monday? 
[02:28:00]  Last night?  Two nights ago.  Yeah.  Hysterical.  The guy is consistently funny.  I mean, people might think some of his act is running a little thin.  I still laugh my bag off every time he goes, you know, what's your name?  I don't think it doesn't matter what you're...  I don't think his act is running thin at all.  And I think some people have said that on xwrestling.com.  I've read some of the postings.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying that his gimmick is stale and all that.  And I think he's just as goddamn funny as he was when he started this, you know, kind  of version of the Rock gimmick. 
[02:28:30]  He's just been not only consistently funny, but consistently entertaining, in the ring,  on the mic.  I mean, it's like, with that circle right now, he's the number one guy.  He's the top dog.  And you realize how good he is on the mic when you see the people that are really bad  on the mic.  Yeah.  Especially if they're, like, doing dueling stuff with the Rock.  Oh, my God.  It's just awful.  No match.  Sick Boy's trying to find my quote in the January issue of Raw Magazine.  Yeah, I know it's in here somewhere.  I think it's near the end, actually. 
[02:29:00]  I think it was one of the last things I said in that article.  Right there.  Right there.  Yeah, there it is.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Here it is.  Opie agrees.  Exactly.  I want the people's elbow in my forehead.  He asked for it.  He gets the chance tomorrow, eh?  He'll throw his little elbow pad off into the crowd.  I just hope we're not disappointed.  Three people, yeah?  I just hope we're not disappointed.  We'll be all excited.  He'll be like, yeah, I'm the Rock.  I'm, uh, you know, the Rock.  If you smell what I'm cooking, buy my book. 
[02:29:30]  Well, Rock, uh, you know, what about your battle now with the, um, you know, McMahon-Helmsley  era?  Well, uh, right now I'm battling to sell my book.  It'll just be like, oh, come on.  Don't do this.  Don't do this.  Don't do it.  We're very excited about tomorrow.  Stan, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, I was wondering what happened to The Undertaker.  Uh, where is he at?  Or, you know, what's the storyline with him?  Recovering from a groin injury.  Ow.  Yeah.  He, every goddamn week they keep saying The Undertaker's going to be back this Monday 
[02:30:00]  on Raw, and, uh, it never happens.  So, they're expecting him to be back on television in some capacity before the Royal Rumble, but,  you know, it's only a few weeks away, so I don't know if that's going to happen by, you  know, I think it probably would have happened already.  But, uh, I imagine he'll probably be back within the next month.  As Jim Ross stated recently on WWF.com, that he's healing nicely.  Hey, I think, uh, here's my prediction, the way, uh, The Undertaker comes back, as Kane. 
[02:30:30]  That's what I think.  It's happened a couple of times before, where he dresses up as Kane.  I think it would be kind of, uh, cool, pull the mask off, everyone will kind of forget  that The Undertaker's done that before, think Kane is pulling his mask off, and bam, it's  The Undertaker.  That'd be cool.  Yeah.  Uh, what's going on with Hulk Hogan?  Nobody knows.  Uh, everybody kind of assumed that when Vince Russo and Ed Ferrar...  Everyone knows brother.  One, two, three, WCW.  Like a brother.  Brother.  Yeah, what a douche. 
[02:31:00]  Brother and brah is the other version of it, which I'll never understand.  We're the guy.  I'll let it all work.  Alan, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  I really want to know, uh...  Hey, Alan.  Brah.  Alan.  Yes.  You have pubes yet?  Hell yeah, yo.  Hell yeah, yo.  He says.  All right.  Uh, yeah, listen, um...  What's up with that whole, uh, China and Jericho thing? 
[02:31:30]  Huh?  I think they're going to fight for another year.  Yeah.  I'm kind of bored with that storyline myself.  It's another angle that's going to turn out forever.  Yeah, hopefully it's, uh, going to be done soon.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Let's go up with some guys in the ring, for God's sake.  Uh, Sal, what's going on?  I'm phrasing it a little differently.  Hey, I was just...  Yeah, perhaps.  Thank you, sick boy.  Sal?  Have them wrestling some guys.  Go ahead, Sal.  Oh, yeah.  I was just wondering what's going on with Mankind.  Is he, like, coming back or something?  It's like, Vince McMahon going to do another one of those things when, uh, all of a sudden 
[02:32:00]  they'll just bring someone back or something like that?  Or is it going to be he's really gone?  I think it's real obvious what's going to happen.  Cactus Jack.  That's right.  Yep.  Making the big return.  They fired Mankind, not, uh, Cactus Jack.  Oh, man.  Because when he appeared on, uh, was it Raw this week or Smackdown last week when he helped  the Rock out at the end there?  Yeah.  He didn't have his mask on and he was looking a little meaner and stuff.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, he's been growing the beard back in.  That's true.  They didn't fire him as Cactus Jack, only as a Mankind Cactus Jack.  Went through the crowd, too.  Yeah.  It was a little weird, you know? 
[02:32:30]  I think everyone knows at this point he's coming back as Cactus Jack, so.  Man at Royal Rumble is supposed to be Triple H versus Cactus Jack for the world title.  Yeah.  They did Hell in a Cell again on New Year's Eve.  Oh, yeah.  I was rewatching the replay of that.  I never get sick of that.  Freaking Rick's, uh, mother-in-law and wife were horrified.  Left the room, got sick.  What?  Linda was feeling sick, and as soon as she saw it, she just got sick. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  The Mankind, the bloody mess he was.  The teeth sticking out of his nose.  Yeah.  Him trying to...  And I'm sitting there...  His tongue through the hole under his lip.  Oh, yeah.  And I thought I was smiling, but I was trying to put my tongue through the hole that got  torn in my lip there.  And I'm...  Oh, God.  I'm snotting on champagne, and I'm, like, so freaking into this, right?  Because they're showing the highlights.  It was one of the best friggin' matches ever.  And I'm going to, like...  It was awesome.  And I'm going to Linda and Linda's mom.  Check it out.  Look right here.  Look, that's his tooth out of his nose! 
[02:33:30]  Freaking out.  And they were just horrified.  Was that when he came through the top of the cage and hit the chair?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How'd that help?  The chair hit him on the face when he landed and, like, cracked his tooth.  It, like, cracked one tooth in half and knocked another one out.  Oh.  What a great moment.  Yeah.  Proud.  Proud moment in mixed career.  Yeah.  His wife and children watching horrified.  I got to go on record, though.  The best match I've ever seen?  The ladder match.  Yeah.  The Hardy Boys and Ed and Christian. 
[02:34:00]  That was absolutely amazing.  Freaking believable.  Yeah.  That was great.  They're trying to milk that, though.  That whole thing.  They're dragging it out a little too long.  It's like with those four.  Richie, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, do you guys see WWF when Mankind did This Is Your Life, The Rock?  Yeah.  Holy cow.  I was there for it.  When he's that poor little old lady, and The Rock goes, you remember when you never used  to let The Rock make pancakes?  All you wanted The Rock to do was make donuts. 
[02:34:30]  It was the funniest thing ever.  And then the girl, he goes, you never let The Rock eat your pie.  Right.  That's great, man.  Hey, guys, you're kicking ass.  I tell you, yeah, we encourage you guys to call in with all your rock stuff tomorrow.  I think we got him for like an hour.  Yeah.  So I just hope he's going to be cool.  Someone wants Fight Club 2000, the first installment, Opie vs. The Rock.  So he can give you the people's elbow and totally rip you a new ass.  I would take the people's elbow.  Would you?  Why not? 
[02:35:00]  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  We've been seeing the orange symbol, and I know it has to do with Taz, but the orange symbol  has all but disappeared lately, and I was wondering, when is Taz going to come in and  take everyone's air and choke everyone out and dump them on their head?  Royal Rumble.  When he's supposed to debut.  Could be sooner.  Could be after that.  I mean, I don't even think they have it really all figured out yet, but it's going to be within  the next few weeks, without a doubt.  All right.  Matt? 
[02:35:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Dan, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  All right.  Is it just me, or does Rikishi Fatu look a lot like Yokozuna?  He's Yoko's cousin.  That's why.  If you really look at me, he looks a lot like Yokozuna.  Yeah, he's Yokozuna's cousin.  That's why they look alike.  No, I don't know.  Well, the only thing that's been trying to hide that it wasn't Yokozuna, and I think that's  how they brought him back.  No, it's not Yoko.  It's his cousin.  All right, whatever.  All right. 
[02:36:00]  His real name is Rikishi Fatu.  I'm filing out of town.  Angelo.  Moron.  Hello.  Angelo?  Yeah, Angelo.  His name is Anton.  Anton.  Yeah.  What up?  What up?  I got a...  Actually, somebody already asked my question, but I got a question.  When the hell is Taz going to show up?  Instead of they doing that crappy orange symbol.  Didn't we just answer that?  Yeah, we just answered that.  Royal Rumble, or maybe a week or so after.  Are we on delay in the radio station, too?  Yeah, really.  In studio delay?  Someone has a question about Ken Shamrock. 
[02:36:30]  I hear rumors he's coming back.  Is that true?  Yeah.  It's been going around the last few weeks that him, The Undertaker, Jack This Jack, and  Vince will all be back within the next four to five weeks.  And the Stephanie thing, you think that's going to play out soon?  Hopefully.  I think it's fun and all, but I think it's going to drag out for...  Another six months doing the WWE.  Yeah.  I would say a minimum of another month, because it all depends on how long they wait to bring  back Vince and Shane.  Right.  But knowing them, it will drag out until, like, friggin' Summer Slam, you know? 
[02:37:00]  I think Stephanie's reached peak hotness without working out.  Yeah.  Like, she's got to now start really working at her bod.  Yeah.  But she's got a set of guns on her.  Hell yeah.  She's got some cans.  It's amazing what they turned her into.  Yeah.  With the makeup and the hair.  Yeah, the hair, and she's got, like, the slut pants on and stuff.  They always thought she was kind of frocky, and then they're like, whoa, look at her.  But her bod, she's got to, like, if she does a little work on it, because she's a big girl,  you know?  She's pretty tall and everything.  And then she's got to stop making that Shane McMahon, I just smelt a bad fart face. 
[02:37:30]  You know?  She keeps doing that.  Yeah, he puckers up the lips and brings them up to her nose and she's like, all right.  Well, stop making that face.  If it wasn't for that, Vince's chin, which she unfortunately has, and a big dumper, she'd  be, like, perfect.  A big dumper, yeah.  You know, it's really hysterical.  Vince isn't coming in here tomorrow, right?  No, no.  No, man.  Oh, he loves this stuff, though.  Yeah.  We trashed his daughter right to his face. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  The pictures up on the Jumbotron of her and Triple H's.  The worst shots they ever could have gotten in a million years and put them on either  side of the goddamn Titanic.  I laugh every time they come on the screen, because they're that funny.  Because all you see in the shot of her is the chin and Triple H's nose.  That's like all that stands out of those two fireloaks.  It's just a miracle, man.  And Triple H's getting damn funny with that whole Chinese guy thing he was doing.  Hung low.  Hung low.  Have a bad day.  Have a bad day. 
[02:38:30]  Hey, Mick Fulry.  Too funny.  All right.  And obviously, Stephanie taking care of business her way, and that's how that's going to end  up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that's pretty obvious to everyone, though.  Absolutely.  Andy, what's up?  Hey.  I heard you guys talking about the Hell in a Cell match.  What did you think about the ladder match?  I went on record and said that was the best match I've ever seen.  Those four guys are the most unbelievable wrestlers I've ever seen.  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  They're just, they bring so much to the show.  And I don't know, I mean, I don't know why one of those two teams is in the tag champs  instead of those other two idiots.  Well, well, you know.  Who the hell has belts?  I don't even remember.  I don't know, they've been changing hands so many times.  Yeah, I think the Outlaws have it right now.  So.  All right.  And they're awful.  Very good, bud.  All right, man.  Yeah, they've lost their heat, huh?  Big time.  Big time.  Oh!  I think D.S. is pretty good.  Jason!  Oh, you didn't know.  No, we just don't care.  We stopped paying attention, Rosa. 
[02:39:30]  We stopped.  I got a question for you.  Jesus.  Yeah, go ahead, Jason.  Yeah, I haven't watched wrestling since I was a kid, maybe ten years ago.  And I used to see, like, Sergeant Slaughter and Bob Backlund and the Iron Sheik.  Whatever happened to those guys?  Do you guys know what happened to them?  The Sheik works, like, indie shows all around the country.  Believe it or not, he does a lot of personal appearances, like, in southern New Jersey.  Like, all these, like, hillbilly towns that put on shows at, like, firehouses and stuff.  And he shows up and poses for pictures. 
[02:40:00]  Sergeant Slaughter still works in the front office for the WWF.  And Backlund, believe it or not, is actually running for Congress.  Bob Backlund's running for Congress.  For what state, you know?  I don't know.  He wants to run for president eventually, too.  The guy's out of his mind.  Is he a kook or is he, like, does he have something, you know, to say?  I just think he's a complete nut.  He was campaigning at the Meadowlands on the October 4th Raw.  And everybody was just laughing at him.  Nobody even knew what the hell he was campaigning for.  Nice.  All right, Jason.  Hey, guys, thanks a lot.  Thank you. 
[02:40:30]  You guys rock.  All right.  I think we're done with wrestling.  People love it.  People hate it.  Austin.  What's going on with that?  What's today's date?  I think it's just a few days away from his surgery.  Yeah, he's going in on the 11th.  He's definitely going to try to come back, too, right?  Yeah.  It's not over.  Six to eight weeks of rehab.  Then he's going to go through, like, a two-week evaluation period.  So there's a possibility he could show up at some capacity at WrestleMania, which is, I think, the first weekend of April.  Cool.  All right, stick boy.  Always a pleasure.  Friend of the show.  Check out tomorrow for the Rock interview. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Check out xwrestling.com.  Take a break, and we'll be back with more stuff.  Stay there.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Booty-dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  OPSS today.  One-oh-two-seven.  One-oh-two-seven.  One-and-down with you, N.A.W.  It's the O&H U.  Hola.  It is Whip'em Out Wednesday.  A little dark now.  Well, I know, but, I mean, we've got to mention it just a little bit so it doesn't go completely away, Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  Ew.  Obviously, it's something that works much better in the spring and summer.  Oh, yeah.  And when the spring does hit in another, what, eight months, we'll bring it back in full force.  But basically, the guys with the wow in their cars, and the women, if they feel like it, whip out their lovely cans on the ride home.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  We've been pretty lucky, I think, to tell you the truth.  When you think about it, could have had snow in November. 
[02:42:00]  You know those winters where it's like, oh, it's snowing in November.  We haven't even had any snow yet.  None in December.  Nothing.  It was, what, 70 yesterday, 60, whatever it was.  Yeah.  It's going to be easy the rest of the week.  A few months, a couple months.  You start feeling it around St. Paddy's Day.  You start smelling spring.  Booze.  And booze.  And puke.  And puke in the streets.  Ah, the smell of vomit in the streets.  Vomit down Fifth Avenue.  You could also smell the loose broads. 
[02:42:30]  Must be springtime in New York.  Yeah, it is.  All right, I'm looking at the list of things we wanted to cover today, and wow, we didn't do a good job at all.  No.  We did discuss ref, boy.  We ran off at the mouth today.  We did discuss strap-on lesbo sex.  We didn't really discuss who wants to be the coach of the Jets, because it's like, whatever.  It's been done to death.  I know, and every other station.  I think Parcells has to come back, though, now.  He has to say face and go, oh, jeez. 
[02:43:00]  You think?  Without a doubt.  What are they going to do?  I don't know.  What the hell are they going to do?  Rumor has it Jimmy Johnson wants to come to New York.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think Parcells comes back, and then the press will make a big deal that, like, Vinny talked  him back into it.  There's no good coach out there that could come to New York.  Marty could come here, right?  Schottenheimer.  I think he's free.  Who else is free? 
[02:43:30]  Jimmy Johnson.  Ray Rhodes.  Ray Rhodes?  Parcell.  There's a few candidates out there, but look at our sports break.  How about that?  John Rocker thrown out of a bar twice in New Orleans.  Really?  Hilarious, man.  When you shoot your mouth off like John Rocker has, you've got to expect the abuse is going  to come your way wherever you go.  Uh-huh.  I guess he was down on Bourbon Street in New Orleans.  Yeah.  And drinking and stuff with some hot chick and, like, a couple of his buds and stuff. 
[02:44:00]  Nile-ing.  And they're pouring drinks from the balcony onto his head, and then he wants to go on the  balcony and beat the guy up.  And it's just a whole scene down there.  That's pretty good.  And what else didn't we discuss today?  Oh, the Ted and Jane thing.  Who cares?  Do you care that Ted Turner and Jane Fonda are splitting up in it?  Do I care?  Yeah.  No.  Although those numbers look pretty funny.  What do you mean? 
[02:44:30]  Boy, you see how much cash he's got?  Ted Turner?  He's got a lot of money, yeah.  It's like Ted and Jane.  Let's see.  Where is it?  I had it in there.  I think it's in the post.  Like, she's got a hell of a lot of money.  Because she, in her own right, here it is, movies and everything and that stupid workout  video, and she has some Time Warner stock.  She's worth $219 million.  $219 million?  Mill.  Okay. 
[02:45:00]  That's pretty good.  Sure.  You would think you could, you know, how old is she now?  60, I think.  62, I think.  62.  All right, 62.  You think with $219 million, you could live out the rest of your life pretty comfortably?  Very comfortably.  Easily.  And Ted, on the other hand, has $9.1 billion.  Jesus Christ.  Now, you know damn well that this twat is going to want half of his $9.1 billion.  Yes, she is.  And do you think she deserves half of it? 
[02:45:30]  Absolutely not.  What the hell did she do?  She's got $53 million in Time Warner stock that she wouldn't have had if it wasn't for  this guy.  Jesus Christ.  So you think it's not fair?  Absolutely not.  Okay.  Well, you know there was a prenup.  You know, that set up.  I mean, yeah.  How long have they been married, though?  I mean, how much?  I don't know.  It seems like forever we've seen them falling asleep at baseball games.  I want to say eight years. 
[02:46:00]  Doesn't it seem like, I don't know, years?  It's like eight or ten years.  That's it?  Yeah.  That's a long time.  I thought it was longer than that, though.  Is that again?  I don't know.  Who cares?  Well, I'm just looking at the numbers.  The numbers.  All right.  We didn't really get to touch on Rosie O'Donnell adopting a third child.  What's this woman doing?  Eating them?  I need another one.  The first two were real tasty.  Yeah.  God, a third kid. 
[02:46:30]  You ever feel bad for, like, dogs walking down the street?  You look at their owner and go, that poor dog has no clue.  His owner is like a third bag or like ugly or just stupid.  You know, I have something.  I have thought that.  You feel so freaking sorry for the pets.  Poor damn dog.  You know, you just want a dog to be in a house with the American family and playing ball in the yard with the kid.  Sure.  But even serial killers have little puppies and dogs and stuff, you know?  Yeah.  You know, you feel bad for them. 
[02:47:00]  Sometimes you see some guy dragging a dog around.  You're like, oh, you just feel bad.  I got to feel bad for these O'Donnell kids.  They're being adopted by her.  Yeah, okay.  They got the cash and stuff.  But look, you're going to have, like, Dyke-o-rama going on in the house.  I don't know.  She says she keeps a male, like, a father figure.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, the paper said a male nanny.  A male nanny, yeah.  That's even worse than having two moms, let's say. 
[02:47:30]  That's what she said is the father figure, like the male nanny.  How many male nannies do you know, Anthony?  None.  Let's see.  None.  Yes, none.  I rechecked, and it is none.  Male nanny.  You got Rosie O'Donnell as a mother and a male nanny being around.  It's still two homos, but it's still two homos, but even a kid, then.  Christ.  Male nanny.  The kid's going to be screwed up either way. 
[02:48:00]  Right?  Are they?  The equation still doesn't work.  Yeah.  No matter how you slice it.  No, that's great.  We could look forward to seeing her and her three kids at the women's basketball games.  And in rehab.  At WNBA?  Yeah.  She's not going to stop there, though.  She wants, like, a huge family.  Great.  She'll probably end up adopting seven or eight kids.  Oh, good.  Great.  Like Mia Farrow and those three seven or eight kids.  Yeah.  She loves Mia Farrow.  Yeah.  She looks up to her.  Look how great some of those kids turned out.  Oh, yeah.  Bang and Woody. 
[02:48:30]  And I think we discussed everything else today, huh?  Yeah?  Yeah, pretty much.  We yelled and screamed at Letterman for bumping Adam last night.  Oh, what a piss off that is.  Oh, we didn't get to play You Might Be a Homo if today.  That could have been fun.  Well, that's always a game for the future.  I'm sure.  What do you think?  We'll never again speak of homo issues?  We're due for the line.  Homo Central.  Five minutes from now. 
[02:49:00]  This is the longest we've gone without saying something homo.  I don't know what it is.  Like a whole 17 seconds.  I don't know.  But I think it's just something about when you hang out with your friends.  Like, hey, shut up, you fag.  Yeah.  Hey, homo.  What are you doing over there?  Just constantly you're throwing that fag thing at your friends.  You're like just throwing the word.  Yep.  You're fag.  All right, Ant.  I think this is a good time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show? 
[02:49:30]  I'll start.  Nothing.  I don't know.  I didn't learn a damn thing today.  Well, the listeners always come up with some good stuff.  212-757-1027.  As we wait for the phone calls to pop in here.  Don't forget tomorrow on the show, The Rock from the WWF.  Very excited about that tomorrow.  Live in our studio.  And I think we've got Jeffrey Ross coming in tomorrow possibly as well.  Oh, yeah?  The roaster.  Who was very, very funny the last time he was in here with Jimmy Kimmel.  I think we set that up.  I'm not positive, though. 
[02:50:00]  All right, let's start off.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today with Mike?  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  All right.  All right.  Hey, I learned that Opie managed to put his foot in his mouth.  I was wondering what he was going to reach for next.  Yeah, I put my foot in my mouth a couple times today.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right, you guys.  All right.  You guys bolt.  All right.  It better get a little better than that or we're going to cut the show off.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned that Ricky Martin, if his singing career doesn't work out, he's going to become 
[02:50:30]  a male nanny for Rosie O'Donnell.  That's pretty good.  That's good.  Hump in head.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  I need another baby.  Send me another baby.  Get in my belly.  Get in my belly.  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back, baby back.  Marty.  Chili.  Hello, Marty.  He stole that movie, by the way.  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  What's up, Marty?  We learned that you changed the call letter three times in three days. 
[02:51:00]  It was N-E-W on Monday, W-A-Y-H on Tuesday, for What Are You High, and today it's W-G-A-Y.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  We're striking out today, gang.  He's a little trying at being clever there.  We're limping to the finish line.  Len, you're next.  What did we learn on the Opioid Anthony show today?  I learned that double-ended dildos make great radio antennas.  Bravo.  Now, that's the stuff we're looking for. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Have a good one.  Thank you, Len.  David, what's going on?  David.  Kill Spaz.  What's your name?  Dude, you're on the air.  Yeah, he knows.  He's trying to listen to himself.  Wow, this went nowhere today.  See, they did learn nothing.  Rest and relent.  Man.  That's what it is.  You plunk them down.  Exactly.  Sometimes they work.  This time, there's bullets in every game.  We keep shooting ourselves over here. 
[02:52:00]  And we're so pathetic, we keep trying to make something happen, you know?  Oh, like, there's nothing.  What's this weak stuff, white man?  I'm ready to pack it in.  You're trolling.  I'm trolling.  We've got three minutes before we're back.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh.  Have you honestly listened to him?  Um, I got to say, when we're in the office, and it's on the PA, I listen to it for the  time it takes me to lunge at it and turn it off. 
[02:52:30]  And then, uh, if I'm in my truck, and I start it up, and, uh, any W was left on from my drive-in  listening to the chick, um, that split second until I could change the station.  But that's about it.  So I hear, like, ah!  Ha!  That's about it.  When did he start?  Like, mid-September?  Yeah.  I think I listened for the first two weeks.  Hmm.  I haven't, I have no clue.  I have not listened in at least two months.  And you'd think, you know, after everything, we would have listened at least during the holidays 
[02:53:00]  to see if there was some fun Yule Log stories, but nothing.  Nothing.  You only heard that on this show on More Stuff.  Yes.  What a Yule Log.  Hey, Dave, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that anybody who thinks that one woman doing another with a strap on is not sexy  should be riding a jet ski with Ricky Martin.  All right.  Very good.  So you're into the strap-on Lesbo set.  Oh, how could you beat it?  All right.  Very good.  Speaking of which, give me my penthouse back.  Yes.  Kind of a good example.  Well, that's where we got it from. 
[02:53:30]  Always makes for some good looks on the Long Island Railroad on the way home.  And you just casually open it up like this when you sit across from someone.  You're just like.  On the train.  Oh, man.  You get the most horrific looks.  They're great.  All right.  I mean, you guys have let us down today at the end of the show.  Just struck out on the learning thing.  Well, some days, I guess teachers in school feel the same way.  Bell rings, the class leaves, and they feel they've accomplished nothing.  We should have changed the question at the end of the show today to you might be a homo if. 
[02:54:00]  That would have worked a lot better today.  Maybe tomorrow.  Hope should shut mouth.  Hope getting in touch with feminine side.  Hope developed taste for man crotch.  I would go to it, but it's based on nothing.  Learn a little of homo in everyone.  What?  Tim, a little bit of homo.  No, let me clarify this first.  He got it wrong.  All right.  Go ahead, Tim.  I said not to take the wrong way.  There's a little bit of homo in all of us, but there's a hell of a lot more in you, Opie. 
[02:54:30]  In all ways mentioned.  Thank you.  All right.  What an idiot.  We want to finish on an up note.  We try every night to finish on an up note.  Nah, man.  Too late.  There's just nothing there.  All right.  Checking the radio message board.  I think he still has it shut down, Opie.  Oh, yeah, because I'm sure our listeners are still pounding that.  We'll wait until after we're off the air, but there is a link on the unofficial website. 
[02:55:00]  Do we have to give these away tonight, or can we wait until tomorrow?  No, we can wait until tomorrow.  All right.  AvengerMusic.com, by the way.  Yes.  F-O-U-N-D.  Oh, you get spazzing, you're yelling out.  Exactly.  Steve's here from the unofficial website, foundrymusic.com.  Woo-hoo.  And Sick Boy, thanks for stopping by from xwrestling.com.  And with that, see, I'm trying, but there's just nothing on the phone, so.  Nah.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, too.  Thanks for listening.  Don't even try to figure it out. 
[02:55:30]  Just go along with it.  Whatever.  1027.  1027. </pre>
