<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on XM202 was a chaotic mix of planned listener attacks, celebrity interviews, listener calls, and unrelated tangents.  The show opened with a detailed discussion of a successful coordinated listener assault on the Shannon Burke Show on Real Radio.  Listeners, using pseudonyms like "Ben's Licious Hog" and "Chester's Liver," flooded Burke's lines with disruptive calls and targeted his message board, showcasing their creativity and dedication to the cause.  Opie and Anthony played numerous recordings of these calls, highlighting Burke's repeated use of the "dump button" to cut off the onslaught.  The hosts mocked Burke's perceived inability to handle the situation.

The broadcast then transitioned to a variety of unrelated segments.  These included a listener's personal account of testicular cancer, a suggestive call seemingly promoting a boyfriend's comedy act, a discussion about sexual predators in nursing homes, a rapper name trivia segment, and a report—treated with a mix of shock and dark humor—on Don Geronimo accidentally killing his dog, Rudy.  The feud between Sean Hannity and Ed Asner was also discussed, with audio of Asner's angry comments played on air.  A listener complained about a frustrating neighbor, and the show concluded with a chaotic incident involving a production staff member, Bernie, throwing a CD in anger.  Throughout these segments, the hosts and callers used highly offensive language and discussed offensive topics.  Jim Norton was mentioned as being in Florida, but no other guests were explicitly identified as being in the studio.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion about the hip-hop community, specifically focusing on the violence and controversies surrounding 50 Cent and the alleged role of white record executives in promoting this image.  A phone guest, Earl, described as a "black expert," participated in a highly charged conversation that included racial overtones, discussions of "home training," the commercialization of hip-hop, and accusations regarding white influence on the genre.  The segment also included discussions about a planned live broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe for St. Patrick's Day, Anthony's brother's cover bands (U2 and Journey), a Led Zeppelin tribute band, and audio clips of rap music and cover bands.  The segment also touched upon Michael Jackson's trial and a bizarre news story about his alleged interactions with his chimpanzee. Listener calls further fueled the controversial discussion.

Another segment began with a caller, Julie, discussing her car accidents and loyalty to the show. This transitioned into further discussion of Don Geronimo's dog's death, along with other animal-related mishaps and cruel statements. The conversation shifted to the Michael Jackson trial, including the allegations, Martin Bashir's involvement, and the celebrity witness list. A caller made a disparaging comment about Jackson, and one host joked about using anatomically correct dolls to tell his story.  The focus then turned to the upcoming "Vag Pump" device encountered at a Las Vegas porn convention, with graphic and sexually explicit descriptions and plans to use it on female guests, including porn stars. Steve-O called in, intoxicated or high, discussing his drug use, upcoming appearance on Jay Leno, and romantic life, casually mentioning a friend's death from an overdose and flying a Mexican woman to the US. The show also featured a discussion of "RateMyWow.com," a listener-submitted hip-hop song about the website, and an explanation of Jim Norton's absence due to needing to defecate and/or masturbate.  Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson then called in, promoting *Be Cool*, discussing his movie persona, his role in the film, *Doom*, his relationship with professional wrestling, and a past misunderstanding with the hosts involving a racist online wrestling fan. The Rock also laughed off a previous tense encounter stemming from this incident.

A subsequent segment included an interview with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, promoting his new movie *Be Cool*. The conversation covered his part-ownership of his movie persona, his role as a gay character in *Be Cool*, his upcoming film *Doom*, and his past in professional wrestling.  The hosts jokingly mentioned a past tense encounter with The Rock, stemming from a misunderstanding involving a racist online wrestling fan. The Rock laughed it off.  The segment also discussed a past incident where wrestler Stevie Richards choked Opie, leading to a discussion about staged versus real violence in professional wrestling. This was followed by a studio segment with comedian Slim Shitty, who premiered a song about killing his neighbor's dog, Chester.  Further discussion included a listener’s bachelor party plans, a news story about a plastic surgeon molesting a patient, a brief, interrupted play of a Motley Crue interview from Regis Philbin's show, an anecdote about a 92-year-old woman impaled on a bathtub faucet, and the differences between "unlucky lottery" and "sucks-to-be-you" stories.  Crude humor and banter were frequent throughout.

The broadcast ended with a tense exchange between Opie and Anthony, with Anthony accusing Ben of sending notes requesting Jim stop criticizing XM Satellite Radio, which Ben denied.  Anthony ended his participation abruptly, stating "I'm out of here" twice.  The show concluded with more listener calls and various humorous and crude segments, including a bit where a listener falsely claimed to have been fired for masturbating, and a discussion of another listener-submitted song.

They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just, XM202.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  Yeah, yeah, y'all. 
[00:05:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  Oh, ow. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, right?  I don't know.  Ow.  Ah.  Oh.  Shut up, man.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America, and the virus hit Orlando, Florida, big time yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  Hi, Anthony.  How are you?  Oh, yeah.  Bunch of pests.  We just, we entertain a bunch of pests and nuisances.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to get right into it today.  Our listeners had a lot of fun.  They're just relentless.  They're hysterically funny, and they're assholes.  Thank God they're our fans.  Thank God, because I wouldn't want to deal with them.  Oh, what a nuisance.  Imagine you're just trying to do your radio show, and these agitators are just calling 
[00:06:30]  up and making all kinds of inside jokes about the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, you think you have a good caller on the line, you're having a conversation, and you've  got to find out the call is from Ben's hog or something.  It's just horrible.  What a bunch of pests.  I've never heard an assault before, and I was online listening to this awful show online  yesterday, and I was laughing really, really hard.  We made his show very funny yesterday.  Very funny.  Yeah, we called in an assault yesterday, and it worked great. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, on two fronts, on the air, on his radio show, and then there was another front, the  message board.  There was a message board that got pummeled, and I have up here a few of the names of people  that were...  He has a message.  I couldn't even get on it yesterday.  I must have smashed him.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it was very busy with people like Chester's Liver was writing in.  Of course, Lil' Connor Peterson. 
[00:07:30]  And look, a couple of posts from Golden Buns, and the subject here is Monster Rain, and it's  from Ben's Licious Hog.  Ben's Licious Hog.  Ben's Licious Hog.  Flaming Steve had a few comments, as did Wine and Jopalog.  And then a couple of posts from just Munaki.  I don't know what that could possibly mean, but Munaki checking it. 
[00:08:00]  The names, fucking hysterical.  They're out of their minds, just pests.  I can't think of another word.  You are pests.  But we love you.  God, that was fun.  Well, of course, it all started yesterday.  This guy, Shannon Burke, took a couple shots at us.  Yeah.  Pretty much trying to tell his audience that we were failures at XM and stuff, and that's  why we're, I don't know, being taken off the premium channel, or that's why we...  What was he trying to say?  I don't even know. 
[00:08:30]  They were saying that they took his show off of XM because they're trying to make the  entire platform boring so that people will be forced to subscribe to our show, is what  I believe he was trying to say.  Yes.  So it was...  That's a pretty roundabout way to...  So is that a backhanded compliment in a way?  No, not at all.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  No, no.  He's saying we suck so much that they have to eliminate anything even remotely entertaining  on the rest of the platform to get people to subscribe to us. 
[00:09:00]  Ah, I gotcha.  Yeah.  And then he said that we're pretty much failures.  Yeah.  It hasn't worked since moving to XM, and we don't have many listeners.  Oops.  So we called in an attack, and we showed them how many listeners we really do have.  Oh, it's hysterical.  I don't think a legitimate caller got through.  They got through his retarded phone screeners with their stupid, pesky story.  But they're really good, though, because a few of them I actually thought were legitimate,  and then you hear, oh, and a forever.  I'm like, Jesus, that was a good one.  Oh, they nailed them. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, everyone did a great job last night, or all day yesterday, I guess.  I think it was like 10 in the morning.  I think there's middays.  Yeah.  Which is always the sign of a powerhouse radio program.  Oh, of course.  Doing middays in Orlando.  Midday slot.  You really shouldn't mess with this program.  You really shouldn't at this point.  I mean, we've got all sorts of systems set up.  The listeners are ready to attack at any given moment.  The message board had, it was page upon page upon page of posts coordinating the attack,  congratulating people that have gotten through. 
[00:10:00]  It's a whole multimedia event for the guys on WackBad.  Shannon Burke should realize that Howard Stern doesn't even mess with us.  Howard doesn't even have the balls to mess with us.  He runs to his ball.  So why are you messing with us?  Are you insane?  Completely unprovoked.  Nobody had ever badmouthed the guy from the show.  We didn't even know who he was.  Exactly.  And after today, he'll go back into obscurity.  Never heard of him.  That's the beauty of what we do.  Oh, yeah.  We'll give you some attention.  And then we will move on with our radio show, and you're just left in obscurity. 
[00:10:30]  So you're a star for a day on our program.  Congratulations.  And then we move on, because that's what we do, right?  And how stupid is this guy that, you know, it's obvious we're getting off the premium channel,  which is huge, exciting news for the Opie and Anthony program.  That means we're going to have to start building this channel.  Yep.  We're going to be adding some shows.  Mm-hmm.  I guess we're not going to be adding Shannon Burke's show to our channel, huh?  Oh.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That consideration goes out the window. 
[00:11:00]  No problem.  Would have been nice, huh?  Yeah.  Pretty nice slot.  Pretty cozy slot sliding in on our channel.  Yeah, we have a say in who's going to join this channel, and it's not going to be Shannon Burke.  Of course not.  So if XM's going to bring your show back, well, you know, have fun with that.  Uh-huh.  But you're not going to get to our support whatsoever.  No.  Anyway, he was trying to do a show yesterday.  Trying.  Oh, my God.  Trying his best.  Just the nudges. 
[00:11:30]  You're a bunch of nudges.  I have, like...  I love them.  I have, like, 12 calls from the listeners.  Yeah.  And I think this is only half of them.  Yeah.  It happened all day long.  All day long.  It just didn't stop.  And he didn't know how to use the dump button, so there's cursing going on and all sorts of stuff.  Yeah, cursing went out.  He's trying to dump out.  But then the online feed, it was very funny.  Very funny.  Well, let's start with this call. 
[00:12:00]  Jim in Clearwater.  Jim, you're on Real Radio.  Yeah.  I had testicular cancer.  Yeah.  I right now have one testicle.  Yeah.  Can't they put a fake one in there?  No.  Yeah, they can't.  Well, the thing is, like, they called me Little Connor because they say only one nutter's  drop.  It's kind of a joke about Connor Peterson now.  A little baby joke.  And you're a fucking tool bag.  And O&A...  Oh, he was swearing like he had two nuts.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  Way to go.  That's all he has to say after that.  Oh, O&A.  Yeah.  He's getting into the call.  Way to go.  Little Connor.  They call him Little Connor.  Not addressing what just happened.  Typical radio fraud.  Yeah.  Just pretend it didn't happen.  Move right along.  You know, oh, the O&A called and come in.  Get back to the show with my natural voice.  And you just know he's right there.  He's annoyed.  Sure he is.  He is annoyed.  Well, dude, we've got to be careful because I understand a lot of Shannon Burke fans may  be calling into this program this morning. 
[00:13:00]  Uh-oh.  Hey, hey, everybody in that room over there, make sure you screen properly.  We don't want Shannon Burke calls getting through.  Let's batten down the hatches.  Let's all get ready.  I know.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Jimmy, love you.  Shannon Burke has faggot tattoos.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, I'm supposed to.  Forget it.  So that was just the beginning.  Here's another one.  Yeesh.  Here's Ricky.  Ricky, go ahead.  Hey, Shannon.  How are you doing?  Good, man.  Doing good. 
[00:13:30]  Ricky, the intern.  Ricky, the intern.  Already he's in there with a funny little name.  Yeah, you've got to be a faithful listener.  Well, we'll explain some of these.  Little Connor, obviously, is self-explanatory.  But Ricky is our intern, Ricky.  Screwed up the order yesterday and every day.  Who's being played by Sex Bagel.  Oh, is that Sex Bagel doing this call?  Wow.  It's Eric.  All right, Eric.  One of our producers here.  Yeesh.  Here's Ricky.  Ricky, go ahead.  Hey, Shannon.  How are you doing?  Good, man.  Doing good.  I don't know if you saw this news piece that Channel 2 was running in Orlando about sexual predators 
[00:14:00]  found in the state nursing homes.  No.  But some of these older guys that they didn't realize were sexual predators were being left  unattended in nursing homes with people's grandmothers and they're assaulting like 77-year-old women  and whatnot.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's horrible.  And, you know, I have a grandmother in a nursing home and I was talking to a friend of mine  and he was like, do you really think this would happen?  I'm like, kind of, yeah.  But how does that make you feel knowing that, you know, O&A are doing... 
[00:14:30]  Guys, nobody understands what a dump button is, apparently not.  What's the...  Idiots.  Idiots.  Yeah, wow.  Good comeback.  Hey, where's the dump button?  Hey, stupid.  How about addressing what went on?  Yeah.  How about telling your listeners, hey, I shot my mouth off at guys that had never bad-mouthed  me or heard of me and now their callers are assaulting me and I'm doing nothing but dumping  out of it and going back to my fucking cornball show.  Now it seems I can't do a program today and take phone calls because Opie and Anthony fans 
[00:15:00]  are ruining my show.  Yeah, and the guy's just hiding behind the dump button.  Yeah.  You know, if you're supposed to be this brilliant talk show host, then go with it, man.  Let it fly and go with it.  Let it fly.  We've always let it fly.  Other people want to call this show and mention other radio names?  Go ahead.  Yeah, it's happened before.  We'll tell you when they're on.  What channel?  Listen to them.  Go ahead.  Go listen to them because most of them stink.  Like Shannon Burns.  You stink.  We don't panic and go, oh my God, where's the dump button?  Doesn't anyone know where the dump button is and what it's about? 
[00:15:30]  You know why you need a dump button on that show?  Because it's shit.  It's corny.  The only funny part of that was the ONA listeners calling in and assaulting you.  That's it.  Dull fraud.  I got to call Eric out.  He was trying to do your bit and he failed miserably.  Yeah, he didn't do it too well.  Failed miserably.  I got to defend Hawk because he did just kind of say it and it was like, that's kind  of a weird one.  Like, you know, especially with the fraud that guy is, he never would have just went  with an honest reaction.  He just would have plowed right into something.  I don't know.  He kind of screwed.  You just sounded like a nervous caller, you know? 
[00:16:00]  Well, here's Amanda.  Ooh.  A girl would be, you know, the least likely suspect to be doing something like that.  Amanda's great.  Listen to this one.  Really good.  Here's Amanda in Fort Lauderdale.  Amanda, how are you?  Hey, what's up, Shannon?  How are you?  What's going on?  Great.  I just, I'm calling to defend girth, actually.  You're defending girth?  Yeah.  It really, I mean, I don't know what these women are talking about.  It's really not the size that matters.  My boyfriend that I'm currently dating just has a really thick penis.  And we were making love at Fort Lauderdale at the Improv from March 24th to 26th. 
[00:16:30]  And it was pretty much just the best sex I've ever had in my life.  Thank you.  I don't understand what that was.  It was a plug.  Plug for her boyfriend's a comic or something?  Yeah.  He has the comedy penis.  Why is he laughing at that?  I don't know.  That's not funny.  Comedy penis. 
[00:17:00]  Kuma.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Obviously, Jim Norton is playing down there.  You bet I am at the Improv.  And I want to thank beautiful Amanda for that fantastic plug.  That was a very good plug.  Oh, you bet it was.  I didn't even know I was there those days until I heard that.  Fantastic job.  She blindsided him with that one.  All right.  We have the next one.  It's Jesse calling in.  Here's Jesse in New Smyrna.  Jesse, how are you?  Hey, how are you doing, Shannon?  Good.  I'm down in New Smyrna right now. 
[00:17:30]  Down here for Bike Week.  I heard you talking about that earlier.  Second time I was down there.  I was down there last year with my friend Ben.  We went to a couple hot spots.  Right, Ben.  T-shirt contest, stuff like that.  Ladies up there.  Cabbage patch.  Did you catch that?  Ladies up there herkying and jerking around.  Are you kidding me, Ben?  Yeah, because, of course, dummy talks over him.  Right when you're here with my friend Ben, you just know it's one of the gags.  And you're listening like, oh, here it comes.  It's just hot spots.  Herkying and jerking. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, listen.  If you listen close, you can hear me.  He's herkying and jerking.  The second time I was down there.  I was down there last year with my friend Ben.  We went to a couple hot spots.  Wet t-shirt contest, stuff like that.  Ladies up there herkying and jerking around.  Cabbage patch.  Did you hear that in the background?  Herkying and jerking around.  Oh, it's cool.  I love it.  T-shirt contest, stuff like that.  Ladies up there herkying and jerking around.  Cabbage patch.  Yeah, just wondering if there's anywhere you could tell me to hang out.  You probably know a couple of the hot spots around there. 
[00:18:30]  Let me know.  I just roll around Main Street and what's that place called?  The Dock or the Yacht Club, the boat thing?  Oh, yeah, I heard of that.  I haven't been down there yet.  Anywhere, anywhere.  I mean, it's a, you know.  The No Name Saloon, that's a hot joint.  Yeah, a big party going on there.  I actually have a friend who couldn't make it but listen to your show all the time.  His name's Chester.  I just wanted to say hello to him.  He's at home.  He has a little liver problem.  All right.  But O&A forever.  See you later.  From Chester.  Weird, weird calls today. 
[00:19:00]  Really?  Is that what you have to say?  Weird, weird calls today.  Funny, weird stuff, Ed.  Funny.  Weird calls.  Weird.  You know what it is?  He's a real rebel, and I guarantee you his program director told him to shut his mouth.  Yeah.  And you know what he did?  He shut his mouth.  Just don't acknowledge it.  Press the dump button with that arm that looks like the Partridge family's bus.  That awful tattoos.  Ugh. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, just press the dump button and don't acknowledge it like your boss told you to.  Cover it up with a few phony laughs.  Yeah.  Why don't you just say LOL.  LOL.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yuck.  LOL.  Well, I personally didn't like the Chester reference.  I think that was a great reference.  Chester is home with liver problems.  Oh, it just keeps on going.  Check out this one.  Here is Chris in Daytona.  Chris, you're on Real Radio.  Hey, what's going on, bro?  Listen, I think that Michael Jackson would have a much worse time in prison than Scott Peterson. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, traditionally, kid touchers get a much worse time than kid murderers.  Baby killers, baby molesters get a harder time than baby killers.  Absolutely.  I mean, this one time I was talking to my friend and he was just like, baby killers?  They don't have that much of a bad time.  You were talking to your friend that was in prison?  Yeah, my friend was in prison.  He was like, he was a kid toucher and, you know, there was another guy who was a baby killer. 
[00:20:30]  And I was like, give him a really hard time.  And he was like, yeah, I do.  All right.  You've got to be careful who you hang out with.  That's another one of ours, stupid.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Doing the Jimmy bit.  And he's like, yeah, I do.  You have a hard time?  He's like, yeah, I do.  What an ass.  How do you not acknowledge it when a guy comes in and says, my friend is a kid toucher?  How do you not go into that?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Just keep the phony radio voice on. 
[00:21:00]  Cornball, one market, awful program you have.  You're listening to The Shannon Burke Show on Real Radio.  Real Radio.  He works for Real Radio?  Yeah.  It's the biggest phony I've ever heard on the air.  It's real, man.  We're just keeping it real here.  You're an asshole. 
[00:21:30]  What's wrong, Jimmy D?  He's like, dude, you've got to check out this picture.  You've got to check out this picture.  I click on it and it says lemon party.  Yeah.  And I click on it.  One dude with another dude in his mouth.  It was three dudes.  Yeah.  And they're like 80.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Old queers.  All right.  Guy's funny, man.  Yeah.  Old queers.  Yeah.  He's really good.  Whack Bag is checking in.  Doug Out Doug from Whack Bag saying that Whack Bag is now demanding an hour on our channel. 
[00:22:00]  Or we will turn on you guys.  You don't need an hour on our channel.  You got one on the Orlando station yesterday.  Yeah.  That's the problem with what we created.  They're going to take over for us.  It's like Willard believing.  Eventually, we're just going to be eaten alive and spitting out by the second pair.  Yeah.  Right.  Notice that just like Robin, Shannon's golfer sidekick is equally useless on the air.  That's Bach from Whack Bag. 
[00:22:30]  Caulfield from Whack Bag saying Shannon's regular callers were so awful that we just kept expecting  a Jimmy bit at the end of it.  Like his regular callers is so bad, it sounded like Jimmy's bit.  Very funny.  See, these guys don't understand that the listeners to this show have a very vested interest because  they're a big part of the show.  Right.  We're not just doing a show and then all of a sudden, ah, the listeners listen.  There are always instant feedbacks and the website plugs.  They're a big part of the show.  Yeah, their comebacks usually whenever we attack somebody is, oh, go ahead and do whatever 
[00:23:00]  O&A tell you to do.  It's the furthest thing from the truth.  We're not telling them to do anything.  Our listeners do feel like they're such a part of the show that if the show gets attacked,  you're attacking them and they take it upon themselves to be the pests that they are  just getting in there under your skin and ruining your program.  And it's very rare you can get all these people together for an internet attack so they live  for this shit.  Oh, of course they do.  So you dumbbells that pipe up, this is what you're going to get.  Oh, yeah.  We only break out the attacks every once in a while, so.  I would hope that more, I mean, you know, I would never encourage people to do something 
[00:23:30]  that's inappropriate because that's very bad taste.  But I got to tell you, I listened yesterday and I fucking howled.  It's hysterical.  And I can't wait to listen today.  They're the telephone equivalent of the roadside bombings.  Horrible insurgents.  It continues.  Listen to this one.  Here's Brian.  Brian, you're on Real Radio.  Hey, Shannon.  Yes, sir.  Not you.  What does that mean?  Not you.  He thought it was funny. 
[00:24:00]  It's not even the bin.  Try to be a little more funny.  Don't hang up like a pussy.  There's a lot of a-holery going on today.  Notice that?  The level of a-holery is at an all-time high.  It is.  A-holery.  A-holery?  A-holery.  A-holery.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  And don't hang up like a pussy.  What have you been doing, you fucking dump button pushing one market motherfucker?  Stop hitting the dump button.  Oh.  A-holery.  There's a funnier furry pie laying in Don Geronimo's driveway than on that guy's show. 
[00:24:30]  Stop it.  Un-funny a-holery.  Yeah.  We'll get to the next enemy after the break.  An unbelievable story coming out of Washington today, too.  Oh, it's just a great day to do radio, man.  Oh, horrid.  Continuing with Shannon Burke, though.  Who thought we didn't really have any listeners?  Or fan base?  Not.  Here is Reggie.  Hey, Reggie.  How are you?  Hey, what's going on?  What's happening, man? 
[00:25:00]  Can I suck your C?  Help you and Anthony suck.  Punch it out.  What?  Punch it out, Phil.  The guy's doing the Richard Treehouse bit.  Holy Jesus.  See?  Oh, is that funny?  Faithful listeners almost driving off the road.  New listeners.  You'll get it eventually.  Oh, he's doing the Richard Treehouse bit.  God damn.  That's Anthony's bit the time he was in a treehouse and his friend came on to him. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, he turned gay right there overnight.  And so Anthony had to make believe he was sleeping and he was fake snoring so the dude wouldn't suck his dick.  I wouldn't give him an answer.  The guy was asking, can I suck your cock?  I was like making believe I was asleep horrified.  Like in the corner of the treehouse like...  And this guy was doing the bit.  I gotta hear that again.  Please do, yeah.  That's great.  Here is Reggie.  Hey, Reggie, how are you? 
[00:26:00]  Hey, what's going on?  What's happening?  Can I suck your C?  Jip, jip, jip, jip, jip.  Opie and Anthony suck.  Jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip.  Punch it out.  How can I film it?  What the hell was that?  I knew that one.  The guy said he wanted to suck on a seed and then he said jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip.  What was that mean?  No idea.  Never heard of it in my life.  That's probably the 30th time he's called me a day.  Really?  Yeah.  Of course it is.  I'm pissed.  Well, if you had any real listeners, stupid, they wouldn't all be able to get through. 
[00:26:30]  I know, right?  Jesus Christ.  This was the easiest show to get through.  Oh, man.  The easiest.  God damn, that's funny.  Jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, punching out.  And all this dumbbell has to say is, what was that?  That's kind of weird.  I want to suck your seed.  What?  Here is Raymond in Edgewater.  Raymond, how are you?  Good.  How are you doing, Rick?  Good.  First of all, I'd just like to say great show.  Thank you.  Not you.  Oh, and A on it. 
[00:27:00]  Not you.  Guessing with the Bob Kelly, not you.  Oh, that's great.  I didn't hear half of these calls.  Listen again.  Ass is.  There's more to it.  Here is Raymond in Edgewater.  Raymond, how are you?  Good.  How are you doing, Rick?  Good.  First of all, I'd just like to say great show.  Thank you.  Not you.  Oh, and A on it.  You don't get on the air.  That was great. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, and A on it.  We do have caller ID.  You know?  Yeah, so?  Yeah, who cares?  So does everybody else in the country, fatso.  And why did he dump out an O and A?  Why?  Why?  You mad at the other guy for hanging up.  Don't hang up like a pussy.  Why are you dumping out?  Is O and A an FCC violation?  Stupid.  See, a real broadcaster would go with this.  This would be your show today.  Right.  You would go with what's coming into your program and then, you know, try to spin it.  And have fun with it or attack back or what have you.  You don't just sit there and go, wow, don't we have caller ID? 
[00:28:00]  Doesn't anyone know how to work the dump button?  Work it.  Work it, fella.  Yeah, you're supposed to be so great.  Then, you know, this is what was handed to you today.  Go with it.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys, please stop the assholery.  When I heard the Richard Treehouse call, I spilled my coffee all over my desk.  The O and A army is relentless.  He spilled his coffee.  He spilled his coffee.  Let's take a break.  I'm going to get these Greg and Tony.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a Shannon Burke show.  I'm real ready. 
[00:28:30]  What was that one?  He screwed up.  He was saying he's going to get to Greg and Tony, I guess.  That's hilarious.  And then he realized at the last minute what that was.  Let me hear that again.  All right.  Let's take a break.  I'm going to get these Greg and Tony.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a Shannon Burke show.  I'm real ready.  Greg and Tony.  What a bubbling idiot.  Yes, our real name is Greg and Tony.  That's terrific.  That is terrific.  That's terrific. 
[00:29:00]  Want to hear a couple more?  Of course.  Reverend, how are you?  Hey, what's going on, Shannon?  What's happening?  SBK.  How you doing, man?  Hey, preaching.  I'm a big fan of your show.  And I just want to say really quick before I get to why I called it.  Go ahead.  I was really bad news to hear what happened with XM and everything like that.  Because now I've got to listen to an online feed and all that.  It really sucks.  But anyway, glad I could still hear you guys.  I appreciate it.  Thanks.  So the reason why I'm calling is I'm in the Army.  And when I got deployed, I didn't receive dime one from Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony suck cock. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  What makes these idiots?  That's good.  That guy was on forever.  He was holding forever.  Did he actually say Opie and Anthony suck cock on his own show?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  He, like, tried to dump out of it.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a buffoon.  Oh, that's great.  That's all he can come up with?  What a buffoon.  I'm just worried that the Shannon Burke callers are going to start assaulting us back.  Oh, my God.  I hope not.  That would just be...  How would we do a show? 
[00:30:00]  I know.  Frightening.  Oh, you know what we'd do?  Keep dumping out of it and fake laughing and pretending it's not happening.  And then try to get back to the cornball topic of length or girth.  Tee-hee-hee.  How naughty.  You stink.  Fake laugh and make believe it's not bothering you.  Yeah.  You can hear it in their voices.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  David, what's up?  He's calling...  Hey, how's it going, O'Day?  You're calling from Orlando?  Yeah, I'm Orlando.  All right, let's go.  Get the...  Hold on.  Finger on the dump button.  No, no dump button.  That's what I'm talking about this Shannon Burke guy. 
[00:30:30]  This guy's a douchebag.  I don't know anything about him.  We're just proving that we do have an audience, and we do have faithful listeners, and we could  do some real damage, so...  This guy walks from Orlando and thinks he's big shit.  This guy's nothing.  I mean, he gets dumped off XM radio.  Do I think the guy knows about a motorcycling bike if one ran up his ass?  All right.  The guy don't know shit.  All right.  Thanks, David.  He's an idiot, man.  Thank you.  Thanks, Colin.  I really don't know much about the guy, so...  Nope.  Can't comment.  I don't know.  Yeah, who knows?  Here's one more. 
[00:31:00]  Let's see.  We got some great trivia today.  Oh, yeah.  That's good stuff.  We're going to give you the name of the real birth name of the rappers, and the callers  will have to identify their rap name.  I'd love a lot.  Oh, that's a good game, yeah.  I'm going to give you the rapper's real name.  You tell me what his rapper name is.  Here he's...  Tom.  Tom, how are you?  All right.  I'm going to give you the name.  You give me the rap name.  Calvin Broadus.  Is it Nate Dog, Music, Ja Rule, or Snoop Dog?  Raboon, Turn On, Opium, Anthony. 
[00:31:30]  Wrong.  That is not right.  Here he's the...  What did he say at the beginning of that?  I just heard Opium, Anthony, but did he say something at the beginning?  Yeah, he goes, Ramone.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Okay, it was Ramone.  Yeah, I barely heard the Ramone.  He goes, Ramone, Turn On, Opium, Anthony.  Yeah, we got to play together.  We got some great trivia today.  Oh, yeah.  That's good stuff.  Oh, that's great.  We're going to give you the name of the real birth name of the rappers, and the callers 
[00:32:00]  will have to identify their rap name.  Oh, that's a good game, yeah.  I'm going to give you the rapper's real name.  You tell me what his rapper name is.  Here he's...  Tom, Tom, how are you?  All right.  I'm going to give you the name.  You give me the rap name.  Calvin Broadus.  Is it Nate Dogg, Music, Ja Rule, or Snoop Dogg?  Ramone, Turn On, Opium, Anthony.  Wrong.  That is not right.  Here he is...  Oh, God. 
[00:32:30]  You guys rock.  What a dick.  I'm crying.  Ramone.  Oh, my God.  What a complete asshole.  I love it.  You guys proved what a phony this guy is.  He couldn't go with any of this.  Ramone.  He was in panic mode.  Panic mode all the way.  And he was trying to end with,  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Wow.  That was really funny.  I'm going to run home  and listen to this asshole show again today.  Oh.  God, that was funny. 
[00:33:00]  Holy crap.  When he gets to Tony and Greg  and then goes,  Oh, you know it got to him.  That's the booby man in Brooklyn.  Of course.  Ramone.  A Ramone call.  Oh, too funny.  This was the best one, though, right here.  Here is Reggie.  Hey, Reggie.  How are you?  Hey, what's going on?  What's happening, man?  Can I suck your seed? 
[00:33:30]  Jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip.  Opian Anthony suck.  Jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip.  Punch it out.  What in the hell?  What the hell was that?  I knew that one.  The guy said he wanted to suck on a seed  and then he said, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip, jip.  What was that mean?  That's right.  No idea.  Never heard of it in my life.  That's probably the 30th time he's called me today.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  That's interesting.  Really?  Unbelievable.  ONA listeners rolling over his show like an SUV over a puppy dog in a driveway. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  We'll get to that next season.  You just can't wait, huh?  Too bad Frida wasn't holding it at the time.  Oh, man.  Fat fuck.  Good.  I love this, Shane.  Shane from New Jersey.  Let's go to Shane.  Go ahead, Shane.  Hey, what's happening, fellas? 
[00:34:30]  I was just wondering when we could assault this jerk off again.  He sounds like a fucking cheap knockoff of Bubba Love Sponge.  I never really heard Bubba either, so.  I used to listen to him before I got XM.  He's a real tool bag, too.  I don't even think he's on the air anymore.  I think he got dumped.  Okay.  Is this guy on XM?  Who?  Is this guy on XM?  Is this Shannon Burke douchebag?  I didn't even know that he ever was on XM.  I guess he got kicked off XM.  I hear he's coming back on.  I don't know if it's true or not, nor do I care.  But when can they assault him again? 
[00:35:00]  I'll be listening at 10 this morning.  I would hope that it would continue, because it was fucking hilarious.  I don't know what time he's on.  Is it 11?  Maybe 11.  Okay, maybe 11.  All right.  Thanks, Shane.  Yeah, because it's middays, right?  11 to 3.  11 to 3.  There you go.  What's the website?  Have some fun.  Shannon.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  He's on middays?  Yeah.  That's what I was saying.  That's like the worst slot to have.  Right.  Absolutely.  And he's bragging?  Bragging.  Yeah.  They don't put their top talent in middays. 
[00:35:30]  Middays is just that slot that, you know.  Morning drive is first, then afternoon drive, and a lot of people would argue then nighttime  before midday.  Middays.  Because middays, a lot of people, just about everyone is working a 9 to 5 type job.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, he's just in middays?  Yeah.  Oh.  You see what that tattoo is made of?  What?  He drew it himself.  It's like fish around a coral reef, and then right on his wrist, he has his own signature.  Like the artist. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  He has his own name on his wrist, just in case he forgets.  What the hell is that?  Look who I am.  I'm Shannon Burke.  God, this business is just filled with idiots.  What's the website?  Let's give him a plug.  That's how unafraid of you we are.  What plug?  What's his site?  Shannon.WTKS.com.  All right.  Go enjoy his site.  It's fantastic.  There you go.  Why don't we take a break?  We're done with Shannon, because that's what we do.  We move on with our show. 
[00:36:30]  And we move on to the next enemy.  A great story coming out of Washington.  We'll tell you what it's about next.  The dog killer and Mike show.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. life.  I want to leave a big F.U. to the one-toothed bitch that lives upstairs.  Why don't you tell the kids that are running around that aren't yours and you're not getting paid to babysit to go home.  Go to your home, kids.  I'm sick and tired of hearing thunder and bullshit and just crashes and crap. 
[00:37:00]  I want to give a big F.U. to L.B. and Anthony for putting that song on the air Friday night.  I want to send a big F.U. to the ass month that came up with that damn banana phone song.  F.U. do whatever you made that.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to DirecTV because we got three inches of snow and my dish is covered and I can't watch TV on a snowy morning for four hours. 
[00:37:30]  F.U. DirecTV.  Yeah, I got a big F.U. to go out to Jamie Foxx, Mr. Ray Charles himself.  Hey, Jamie.  Hey, you better thank in your acceptance speech the fucking agent who didn't let you do booty call too.  I just want to know who the fuck is Mr. Babicham?  Mr. Babicham!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE1. 
[00:38:00]  1-866-FU-LINE1.  Well, fuck you very much.  Opie and Anthony XM202.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:38:30]  We like to call it the ONA virus.  Yes, the scourge.  You, the fans, help us.  The creeping crud.  Spread the virus.  We know that.  And we thank you for that.  I got to tell you, Ant.  I wasn't even going to come in today, but I knew we'd have just a stellar radio show today.  I couldn't miss out on this one today.  Had to be here.  Had to be here.  With your chest cold thing.  No, it's an upper respiratory infection. 
[00:39:00]  I'm dizzy as hell, but I'm on the super penicillin.  Super penicillin.  I literally get this every winter.  Yeah.  But I get the six pill thing, and it knocks it out of me.  Really?  Yeah, it knocks it out of me.  But I'm hurting really bad today.  I might even walk off.  No.  After we get all the funny out, then I might go for an early leave.  Where's Norton?  There's Jimmy.  He's back.  He's pulling his fly up.  I was whizzing.  It's all right. 
[00:39:30]  Did you wash?  Oh, yeah.  My hands always.  Yeah, always.  Always.  That was a hell of a start to a radio show.  Very funny.  Goddamn listeners.  Usually it's just Ant and I, you know, BSing for a while, but we got right into it.  Right into it.  Very good.  All right, let's go to the phones and say hi to Tom in Philly.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I'm going to guess from the things that you and Don Geronimo have a lot in common, Opie. 
[00:40:00]  Ramone, chill that dog.  Punch it out.  There goes Tom.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Oh.  A little story yesterday.  Well, maybe this will help.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies aren't much fun.  Come on, everybody out there.  Sing along, okay? 
[00:40:30]  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies are much fun.  One more time, the Roman rescue.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies.  That's right, breaking news out of Washington, D.C. 
[00:41:00]  Anthony, you want to take this one?  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Geronimo backs over dog.  We now learn why the Don and Mike show was in rerun.  Mode yesterday on WJFK.

[00:43:00]  goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo  record every time I do a goddamn death dedication now make it and I also want  to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week it's a  god last goddamn time I want somebody use his fucking brain to not come out of a  goddamn record that is that that's up-tempo and I got to talk about a  fucking dog dying sorry I just had to throw that in there  oh is that John on the phone is he on his phone in the SUV tell him to pull 
[00:43:30]  forward he just ran over his little dog and now a letter from a man about bad  breath SUVs and a dog smelly mouth fat fuck anyone else I would be like oh  that's that's a shame but that guy that that phony that crock of shit oh hi I'm  Casey Kasem and this bloody mess is Rudy the little crust dog the letters from Don in 
[00:44:00]  Great Falls it reads dear Casey I was hoping I'd run over my bitch wife Frida but I hit  little Rudy how am I supposed to come out of a goddamn up-tempo number into a  hysterical story like Don Geronimo running over his fucking dog 
[00:44:30]  emotionally distraught  wow that's rough oh man how the hell did that happen and then he couldn't do it  back and out looking over your shoulder having a good day on your way and then  what was that little doodump doodump oh there he is laying in the driveway Don to just scoop 
[00:45:00]  him up and put him in the SUV and drive off to the vet tears in his eyes I guess she tries to  breathe life into his little dog ah was a little Barty crying Frida they gonna look at daddy like that guy that  killed their goddamn dog that's the worst you know when you find your dog splattered in  the street it's bad enough when you kill him yourself oh that's gotta hurt that's

[00:46:00]  what's funny he couldn't do his show though he was too distraught  too distraught running over his little dog for that SUV ouch I wonder if it was the driver's side  probably would killed him a big gut big fat Don on that side of the SUV extra weight couldn't take  it fat fuck oh he probably even back over the dog it smelled his breath and then just killed itself 
[00:46:30]  keeled over then we used to have to spray the uh the Mike sponges and stuff yeah Don and Mike was on  the same station as ours uh back in the day and uh they failed miserably and then when we got fired  they took over for us and uh a lot of the markets and they failed in just about all those markets as  well including Philly was the big one and uh every once in a while because they were uh situated in  Washington they would come up and do their show you know from the New York studios and they'd use the 
[00:47:00]  same microphones that Ant and I would use yeah before us the smell that would come off my microphone  was unbelievable yeah and and then it was a I guess it's a known fact that he has just horrendous  breath but we had we had a whole thing we had to do we had to wash out the the the Mike screens  and and Lysol the hell out of it and it was just god-awful oh his breath smelled like a dead dog  laying in the driveway I would gather uh Ginny from Jersey saying killing his dog is the funniest 
[00:47:30]  thing Don's done in years that's great looks like boo-boo made of boo-boo Ramon bring me a shovel  mm-hmm and just for the rest of them to have to sit there on the air and watch this fat  jackass eulogize his awful animal and not laugh in his face whoa you think they all had to be some  you know fakes and you know being sincere and stuff hey I'm sorry oh darn man oh that's a 
[00:48:00]  great dog that's terrible that happened yeah yeah oh that's awful sorry sorry to hear about  your dog we lost ours a few years ago yes yes it was tragic for the family but you know you gotta  move on Don what'd you do eat it Jim in Jersey what's up Jim precious hope you're feeling better  baby oh thanks buddy uh you know I think we should all call over to Don today maybe uh give my condolences 
[00:48:30]  yeah that would just be a nice thing to do that's not a bad idea uh you know that would be nice that  would be nice I'm sure he's hurting real bad today that's true the Don and Mike show in Washington it  only happened a couple days ago so I think today will be the first days back on the air so oh my god  please someone tape what he has to say about his little doggy oh we would love please someone tape  that and send it in and can I say any callers please if you call him just because he's an enemy 
[00:49:00]  of the opium anthony show he's really having a bad day so be sensitive yeah no off-color remarks  about his dogs of course please be sensitive and you're gonna have to like um reel him in a little  bit because they're on a really long delay yeah oh yeah yeah a quick curse or something we'll never  get through no we'll never get through all right anthony well that's uh very sad news out of  very very sad news and then finally uh i guess this is the the dj hour all the dj's uh sean 
[00:49:30]  hannity is continuing his feud with ed asner it was the weirdest thing we uh interviewed ed asner  while we were out in l.a had a really good time with him because uh ed asner's cursing us out sounds  like you had a good time i had a great time with it doesn't sound like he was having much of a time  yeah he cursed me out because i i pretty much told him he was being very boring on our show yeah but  during the interview he uh talked about sean hannity and pretty much how much he just dislikes  the guy and i had no idea there was some kind of feud going on with him and sean hannity so 
[00:50:00]  sean hannity got a hold of our show to get the audio he's been playing the audio on his show  and i guess the other day he played more audio from our interview with ed asner yeah you got  something over there no um no that might be just some uh blurb from a website i'm i'm checking out  now all right don't mind me okay it sounds like it was funny as you check that out here's uh sean  hannity talking about ed asner and us again uh i think two days ago now all right as we roll along  thank you for tuning in hey sweet baby james ask ed asner's wife i don't want to sandbag her but ask 
[00:50:30]  her if she'd come on because i was just talking to her during the break apparently ed used the f  word he dropped a few f-bombs on me when he was on the opian anthony show on xm radio so to see if  see what uh see if she'll come on ask her yeah now how did you bleep this out good enough are you  sure you're positive i don't want any angry parents you're pot of 100 million percent sure 
[00:51:00]  what teller i just want to talk about the issue about why ed is so mad at me maybe we can maybe  look if if we find that we can have peace in the middle east and we're moving in the right direction  and there's dialogue and discussion going on then certainly sean hannity and ed asner can get along  together will she come on anyway so let's let's play the tape you can you can say on this yeah yeah 
[00:51:30]  yeah it's totally uncensored it's phenomenal who do you want to curse out first uh well let's see did we  cover hannity all the way out ouch oh man and we got one more all right one more at no come on give  me a handshake please  what is that all about there you have it and then apparently now this is on top of the discussion  that he had had with uh mike gallagher where he said we got limbaugh now we're going after hannity 
[00:52:00]  so i don't know what ed asner's problem is with me and then this is what he also said about me this  is from yesterday i think he's a mannequin he's too pretty he really is too he really should be  modeling clothes why do i feel like i need a shower after hearing that with sean is very good in this  day and age because he has such a warped political ideology and that seems to be going very well right  now i think he doesn't he's too pretty he really is too he really should be modeling all right enough 
[00:52:30]  i can't stand it anymore now was she willing to come on she's not willing to come on well why don't  we try and get a number where ed is at and then we'll see if ed will come back on the program with  us and and maybe we could just sort of we're at an impasse here him cursing me out him threatening me  and i don't know where all this hostility is rooted in i mean we've only been nice to him the few  times that he was on this program so i'm not exactly sure what it is that he's so angry about  or upset about but um you know i'd like to get to the bottom of it we got the wife on the end she's 
[00:53:00]  like what did he say you know and i said i got the tape we got the tape we we i got witnesses now  so there you have it a little taste getting a lot of exposure lately for the opian anthony program we  like that we like that we market our show our way that's the new marketing campaign by the way yeah  yeah i was reading a website um that has some uh stuff from from the don and mike show about don  running his his dog over oh really yeah it has like a little thing of what happened somebody's 
[00:53:30]  writing i don't know who it is but it says i apologize there was no show yesterday it wasn't  a beef with infinity it was something awful happened to me yesterday no i guess these are don's words i'm  getting ready to leave and the dogs are running around the car i shoo them away and nine times out of ten  uh they get away but this time i started down the driveway and i hear a thump 
[00:54:00]  that's terrific that's terrific and then it goes to some other person because then it says don said  he got out of the car went to the side of the car and rudy had been hit  i started freaking out i'm screaming and crying and running around frida came out and they both took  rudy to the vet fortunately our vet is close but unfortunately rudy had passed away  don apologized but everyone understood maybe you'll find this amusing when i was in the shower i had no 
[00:54:30]  idea that frida was even close by i was having a real conversation with god about what happened  with oh my god i called him a motherfucker don said when he went downstairs frida said she heard his  conversation with god i mean i really gave it to him  don and mike decided to take some calls don my husband ran over our dog and killed it 
[00:55:00]  i cried for two weeks how's he let's just say he had to tell the kids it was the first time i'd ever  seen him cry mike said what a wuss mike explained that someone had to make the first joke  of what their career you know mike just wants to tease this fat asshole and he can of course he does  little yappy dog getting smushed had a ribbon in its hair probably  thump yeah i heard the thump i had a conversation with god in the shower 
[00:55:30]  god why do i suck so much why why why why did i fail in philly why why  oh yeah why did you make me hit rudy  little dog  yeah so that's it he uh he killed his dog and then had a  a little conversation with god in the shower which conjures up an even more awful image  a naked wet don geronimo preaching to god yelling at god yelling at god god why is my cock so small 
[00:56:00]  and the reason frida heard the conversation is because she has to lift his stomach so he can wash his  dick  fuck you and your boring on-air wife stupid  there we go yeah  poor guy yeah i feel bad all right anthony yep 
[00:56:30]  i think we're going to start the show next all right enough of our other dj segment yeah  well getting a lot of good exposure though sure that's what the show's about getting exposure  for the program  good exposure like sean hannity weird exposure from that shannon burke guy i don't know  but uh getting our names out there spreading the virus that's what it's all about the plague  all right uh we have lots to do today man some weirdo was trying to steal one of the gates  we're gonna get into that story another doctor was busted for fondling a woman

[01:01:30]  we're back with the opian anthony program  a little tease  how about a little tease anthony  tease we're good with teases and story lines and  just something i want to say today  and then let them speculate like mother effers out there all right we're going to try to get the band  back together oh thank you thank you 
[01:02:00]  today's words we're going to try to get the band back together  speculation  start speculating you mother effers  how are you jimmy good thank you  but that was very interesting what you told me during the commercial yes that is  well uh we have uh earl on the line  why would we have earl on the line well earl is black that's true we have a black story and we figure  we get uh we we we get someone that is uh the whitest black guy we know to talk about rap music 
[01:02:30]  earl what's up yo how are you yo yo b what'd it be  uh guess what's going on what's going on with 50 cent  but he's completely lost his mind again  again i mean it this is the most ridiculous story i've ever heard what's with the rap community there  uh black girl yeah no home training what do you expect  say what no home training when you have a disagreement with somebody yeah 
[01:03:00]  you you know you try to work it out you know gunfire doesn't erupt well i think they need uh  they needed grandmammies like jamie fox had that would look that would whoop 50 cents ass  and tell them to be a southern gentleman i it i i it just doesn't make sense to be half  you have a disagree with someone and gunfire of that seems to be kind of commonplace in the hip-hop 
[01:03:30]  community the hip-hop community what the hell does that even mean yeah what i read about it all the  time the hip-hop community yeah what is the hip-hop community uh earl it's not i don't think it's  any different than let's say the rock community there is no rock community it's rock music you  listen to it if you enjoy rock music there's no community i don't get together with other rock  people and try to make legislation what kind of community is this and they're always trying to bolster 
[01:04:00]  their image but they can't because the actions speak much louder than their words there's a rally  here in new york uh against hot 97 against hot 97 against hot 97 and their racist management over  there of whitey their whitey management uh there is a rally tomorrow and it is because the hot 97 does  not represent the hip-hop community in a good light and they want to let the people know what the hip-hop 
[01:04:30]  community is all about it's not about the racism and the violence what are you insane well they've  always been very racially tolerant in hip-hop i mean if you listen to old krs1 lyrics i mean they  really are i mean very very uh yeah diverse group of thinkers uh-huh never any uh lyrics about violence  against women or uh violence against each other you never hear that stuff you never hear uh lyrics  about guns and killing it it's very rare that that's the hip-hop community hip-cop community that's 
[01:05:00]  it hip-hop the hippity-hop community we all get around and bounce earl comment yes earl there's not a lot  i could disagree with but at the same time there's a lot of positives about the hip-hop community name me  one please besides the blood of easy e oh wow god very good bravo i'm gonna be laughing on while i 
[01:05:30]  listen to that on my my file later oh wow you went there didn't you uh well well earl you stink as an  expert on them well you're black you're supposed to be an expert earl from runaki can you please just  help out with some opinions yeah you see i gotta explain what's going on elo down there in washington  he wants all these experts like experts like if we need x if you're talking about sports have that  sports expert you can go to you know maybe someone in if it's a football thing it's uh maybe an ex nfl 
[01:06:00]  player that's just an expert that you guys get along with if it's uh if it's entertainment or or or  gadgets you know maybe it's uh laszlo or you know experts left and right that's what that elo wants on  this program so we figured okay we'll give this a shot uh-huh so we got a black story let's go to  the black expert it's black earl stop you stink what you didn't let me finish we get more out of don's  dog rudy or let me let me ask you i mean the whole thing with 50 cent the rap community a lot of people 
[01:06:30]  think that it's just about violence but then you get the other side where people go well  well again rap music is probably the most original music to come out since since since rock and roll  easily yeah all right and in a way it has created a community it i mean remember hip-hop was always  an underground thing but it was just specifically why does it always have to be a community why does it  have to be this big separatist thing it's a community and guess who isn't invited into the 
[01:07:00]  community why yes we can't criticize the community get yeah guess who's looking at the community  thinking what a bunch of kooks wait a minute who's that is not including the community who's not  included he's making the most money off of hip-hop let's be honest here well that's been the way for  years yeah they're very much a part of the hip-hop community let's be let's be totally honest okay 
[01:07:30]  but then again white people put more money into the hip-hop community are you telling me white kids  are the ones buying more of these cds than anybody and you know it yeah that's absolutely true yeah  that's absolutely true but they're a part of it as much as anybody the rally uh that's taking place  tomorrow is also um it's to show how commercialized hip-hop has gotten and how it has to get back to its  roots in the community this is a whole thing i read on a website that is going on about this uh  this rally tomorrow they have guest speakers and you know it's just gonna be you know really a bash 
[01:08:00]  fest because they said hot 97 is run by whitey it's run by whitey and they have uncle toms in place  that do whatever the white management tells them to do so they could be racist they could commercialize  and profiteer on the hip-hop music that should be you know supporting the community what are they  really uh finding a way to blame white people for this one yes absolutely wow black so i guess  both with white people that pulled the trigger on uh on uh on tupac shakur and on biggie and i'm sure 
[01:08:30]  that was white people too not in inter inter uh you know the gang wars all that stuff it is whitey  makes it so commercial that there's so much money involved that uh the black artists feel compelled to  knock off the competition so they could get more money it's the new drug trade is what they're saying  wow because see i thought whitey originally held them down so now whitey has held them down and in  the same breath whitey is making it more commercial so god forbid they can make more money and because  i guess they're uncontrollable they're not human they don't know how to handle more money and just 
[01:09:00]  deal with lawyers like every other person so they shoot each other is that what the black community is  saying i guess that's how they're putting it well yeah that seems to be what they're what they're  implying yeah well the argument which i don't agree with is that record companies who were  primarily run by white let's be honest they okay they will only promote you know the thuggery the  you know the quote unquote violence that is true the bigger the thug the better he does yeah i don't  agree with it but let me ask you a question not to interrupt you but do you think that if soft-spoken 
[01:09:30]  guys who did gentle lyrics generated more money don't you think that's who they'd promote they  promote money yeah yeah the thug thing is a hot trend right now so they're going with it that's all  that's about how about in rock and roll man in heavy metal all they promote is dope addicts  guys that have all you know tommy lee has been abusive to his wife ozzy uh has abused sharon i  mean there's a different kind of uh of violence there but there's a drug subculture in rock too  they promote that yeah they promote whatever sells that's new in the black community i know you're not 
[01:10:00]  saying this but just the nerve of the hip-hop community can you stop explaining away everything  and take some responsibility well it's the same well going back to the rock argument there was a there  was a period there where sensitive the quote-unquote sensitive singer songwriters got a lot more plugs  you know the james taylors the jackson browns they got more promoted than let's say you know the black  sabbath sabbath made better records you're right they do but you know the record companies pump their 
[01:10:30]  money into those guys because they probably thought they were going to sell better and for a while they  did it's all about yeah it's it's you got to make money you can't be stupid oh let's let's pump our money  and support something that's not going to sell that's ridiculous well there's not integrity this  is this is a very dangerous game that's going on though because that's the whole thing that's  what we're getting carried over it's carried over i would i could understand if this was an act and you  see you say you know 50 cent is like an actor and he's portraying this role of this violent thug 
[01:11:00]  uh in order to sell his music but the truth of the matter is he is a thug it carries over into real  life where it's real bullets flying and shooting these people they're encouraging these rap bars to you  know to to sing about shooting other rappers and stuff because that's the hot trend this is what i'm  wanting to say and it's a dangerous game they're playing because these guys are dying over it yeah  in the end and and the latest is uh you know 50 cent is uh his new albums coming out and um the post  says here bullet prone rap star 50 cent featuring a retaliatory attack after two hip-hop shootouts this 
[01:11:30]  week canceled the times square appearance yesterday and was said to be lying low virgin making store  officials citing security concerns told fans at 50 would not show up for his planned meet and greet  at nine tonight to promote his new cd the massacre his cd's called a massacre this just got too nasty  says store manager after the multi uh millionaire bowed out too many beefs too much to lose industry  insider said the uh threat lead in a new album would likely skyrocket to number one with a bullet 
[01:12:00]  even as the hip-hop world braced for fresh mayhem  yep is that really like how eminem eminem is pretty heavily promoted he doesn't talk about shooting  other people you know it's whatever sounds why what's that he talks about kill the first two  records all he's talking about jimmy jimmy jimmy eminem pretty much produced this 50 cent  well you know what i'm talking about i i know eminem talks about violence but i'm saying he's not giving  real threats like in a real way to other rappers and going this is what's going to happen to you 
[01:12:30]  he's talking shit he's not a violent guy he ribs i understand that but at the same time talking having  several songs about putting your wife in the trunk dead but he doesn't act on it no oh absolutely but  at the same time these guys are acting on it they're shooting each other this hot 97 is a war zone these  poor bastards that's in a nice building and i was listening to the uh news station and some poor  son of a bitch who's got to go into an office every day is worried uh for his life that he's 
[01:13:00]  got to walk through this building with these thugs shooting well because there's been many shootings  outside that oh yeah right yeah yeah a little kim shooting a little kim shooting is on the front  page of the post today yeah and i think a dj jumped the like a rival dj once before the station also  like wars going on that are really killing people in the hip-hop community well listen to the cd  review of uh 50 cents uh new cd all right it says for 50 cent it's all about his rifle and gun and 
[01:13:30]  figuring which is for shooting and which is for fun anthony half of his latest cd the massacre which  hits stores today has mr scent this is in the review has mr scent cocking his clock and rubbing out other  rappers who've slighted him and the rest portrays the bullet riddled mc is a lover man despite tracks like  a baltimore love thing and his double entendre lace number one single candy shop where the man  raps to a young lady i'll take you to the candy shop i'll let you lick the lollipop his gun toting 
[01:14:00]  image dominates in rap after rap 50 cent describes how he's going to settle the war of words with  trigger pulls in fact that's how the disc introduces itself with a hail of bullets fired from a machine  gun there you go that uh record gunplay is the blatant warning anthony where 50 cent is subliminally  subtle is in the album's artwork where new york city certificate of death is uh reproduced with  irving jeffrey as the deceased if you're new to the rap wars irving jeffrey combines the given names 
[01:14:30]  of producer irv gotti the rap wars and rapper ja rule by the way according to 50 cent that uh the pair  have a date with death in a few days on march 8th march 8th he's saying that they're going to die  or something is that the date on the death certificate yeah is that what's uh going on  with that earl well that was the original release date yeah of the record but all right the song  piggy bank makes fun of other prominent hip-hop and rap artists like shine who's in prison and  according to scent is popping off his mouth in a cell nass takes a hit so does fat joe and judicus 
[01:15:00]  at the end of piggy bank scent pokes these uh rap tigers laughs and lets those who've been served know  they've got to do something now you've been served even though who's shooting who is what's really  important here musically this album is neat continuation of cents uh seven million selling  get rich or die trying from 2002 50 cent has been shot nine times he's the fucking sergeant barnes of  rap he's a these guys are fucking for rich he's not pretending to be a thug this is what these guys are 
[01:15:30]  man they're rough dudes they have talent and they become famous but it's like you're going to promote  dealers but you understand that's what they do yeah so it's like how are you supposed to not  promote we're not so this is what they write you think some jewish lawyer is standing over 50 cent  telling him what to write are you out of your fucking mind you know what it's like you know  what it's like it's like when uh they brought kong from monster island and they bring him to new york  uh you're not thinking about the consequences you just know people want to see kong so you strap 
[01:16:00]  them in and you hope for the best and in the long run what happens chaos people wind up getting killed  because you know you can't take kong out of his habitat and throw him in the city and think he's  not going to still be uh a kong probably not the example i would have chosen no maybe not  well guys i think of you think of a guy like jay-z who what who was at a time uh engaged in illegal  activity and now he's a businessman businessman dude so is snoop i'm not saying that they these 
[01:16:30]  guys shouldn't be millionaires because what they do is good fine my problem is don't blame white  management of record stations just take responsibility for it oh absolutely at the end of the day  you you're responsible for you and you but again it goes back to what i said at the beginning it goes  back to home training where what do you what you decide to do once the fame comes in  once the money starts to come in do you decide to grow that who started to get mature or do you 
[01:17:00]  stay a thug put a crib together suits featured on mtv is what you do that's right get some  bitches with all your whips that's the way rappers handle this shit i mean look when when black sabbath  left their manager they didn't shoot him they wrote a song called the riff when neil young and ronnie  van zandt had a problem they you know sweet home alabama came out of it there you go  fucking shoot neil young although neil was seen by an airplane i think you know an excellent  ring with an engine that's funny all right thank you earl thank you guys thanks for 
[01:17:30]  nothing uh tad s from san francisco i have a message for you  wow you're you're giving out um he had a little thing he had a thing all right chris from new york what's  up what's going on guys i just pray 50 cent doesn't get himself shot and killed  because all of a sudden we got to listen like he's some kind of genius for the next six years  well that's true once they get killed it's just amazing and are they really dead 
[01:18:00]  we all know tupac is still living tupac is uh put out what of course six or seven cds and he died  idel from new york  dude don't give answers don't give answers to the speculation just a couple wait let's go to  shane in staten island shane hey guys hey uh i was just curious does anybody know where the hip-hop  community is so i know not to raise my kids there yes it's uh it's called rikers island 
[01:18:30]  the hip-hop community move to the hip-hop community i can imagine ken and philly what's up  what's up i just wanted to say this shit isn't in it isn't only in the uh rap stuff man we got the  mayor of the city of philadelphia saying the brothers and sisters run the city whereas you  know the guy in congress a couple years back i can't think of his name said the word niggardly and  he lost his job well yeah yeah well he said that in a real conversation it's a legitimate word it  just sounds racist but it's not and yeah you're right borden you rock by the way brother thank you  angel eyes oh thank you sweetheart that's it ken all right let's go to cigars and scotch from 
[01:19:00]  whackbag.com i've been listening i'm just curious is this show becoming more afrocentric  afrocentric you should see the afros were growing as we speak excellent yeah but now i used to listen to  the militant black station here in new york was wlib years ago and it was like you know just the most  racist station i ever listened to just constantly bashing uh white people and you know it was 
[01:19:30]  entertaining it was fun i listened to every day because it was really funny it was entertaining  they had one segment about how the melanin in your skin they had an expert on there the melanin in your  skin actually affects your brain also and makes people with more melanin in their skin which makes  you darker more intelligent and this guy is just going on and on about how the blacker you are the  more intelligent you are because of the melanin in your body in your system and i'm listening you know  wow this great stuff it was the most racist radio station on the dial and never really got uh you know 
[01:20:00]  no one ever called him on it because it was it was black people you know talking about white people  uh it was amazing stuff though i wish to listen to very fun to listen to white management encourages  it and is responsible for it but can black people can you stop seeing yourselves as helpless children  whatever whatever like how come you know why aren't you giving white people credit for all your  fantastic accomplishments in a black history month you don't hear a lot about how fantastic white 
[01:20:30]  people are but whenever there's a problem it's white people's fault you want to pass out blame fine  we'll take it give credit too well we didn't uh invent the the peanut oil exactly george washington  carver if i had enough of that motherfucker peanut oil stinks who cares what are you good for you  rub it on your mule when you're whacking your bag what good is peanut oil it's in everything  it's a big deal i'll take the phone or electricity peanut oil is in just about everything yeah is it  really like what heart attacks we'll take the phone electricity and space travel you can have peanut oil 
[01:21:00]  like that's just something yeah there wasn't a bunch of inventions that helped us there that i'm  sure there was some black people were involved there's just one big invention space travel  peanut oil was a big part of space travel what would they have eaten that's actually what makes  tang it's peanut oil what is wrong with peanut oil nothing at all stupid peanut i should not know his  name i enjoy a handful of peanuts every once in a while so do i all right well why george washington 
[01:21:30]  carver i just don't care he gets a high school for inventing peanut oil if that's what he did i don't  know big rob hey how you doing boys what's up sugar tips hello rob thanks for calling the program  i think the one thing uh earl was missing is there's a there's two main factions of the hip-hop  community there's this whole faction of uh militant blacks that and they're the ones you see in the  news and they're the ones organizing these uh protests and all this shit i hate whitey and then 
[01:22:00]  everybody else i mean i'm a white kid but i i grew up in baltimore i'm living in jersey now lots of black  friends all that shit but none of my friends hate white people i mean and and some of them do the hip-hop  thing some of them don't but it's it's just ridiculous that everybody gets lumped into like  one community i mean it's like saying that it's all one community it's just nonsense well dude we  have to look at like baltimore has a really high uh murder rate and baltimore has always been kind 
[01:22:30]  of violent how long did you live in baltimore i lived there for about 10 years baltimore baltimore  you know i'm going down to baltimore uh a little next week i'm actually gonna be down there for a few  days but i'm careful now i'll stay in the baltimore harbor but i don't ever walk around downtown  baltimore because um you were telling me the truth back in baltimore sir please continue  well i've read the case file of you all right thank you thank you bye man when we take that  train ride to dc how scary is it when it starts going through some of those areas wow unbelievable

[01:24:00]  there they're working they're contributing to society uh it just must infuriate them ten times  more than it infuriates me when they read this in the paper and stuff because it just it affects the  entire race it just does in my i mean look when i see white people like you know whether they're  skinheads or clansmen i don't look at them as like a bad part of wife they're just dirtbags yeah like i'm  not embarrassed for them as another white guy i don't give a fuck about them they're just animals and 
[01:24:30]  and there's savage you know a cross-burning animal fuck them uh so i don't know why other black people  would even care like like you understand it's not even about hip-hop or people being violent be  violent who gives a shit that's your business but just don't blame white people for your own actions  stop it they're millionaires if you can't tell millionaires hey look stupid you're millionaires  don't shoot each other but bill gates and steve jobs shoot each other for christ's sake  ah that'd be some battle let's say hi to floyd in alabama sissy pushing each other

[01:25:30]  intelligent conversation about the subject because then now we're talking like we're talking and we're  labeled a lot of people would label what we're saying racist because of people like that and they  lump all that in the same category yeah but that's what i'm saying exactly an example like that i don't  i don't have any connection to that call or what that guy said i'm not like well he's making the  white community look bad yeah do what you want stupid run around the dixie flag tied to your  cock and smack your mother in the face with it i mean i didn't mean to get sexy all of a sudden  i'm just raising an example all right anthony we're going to take a break uh-huh want to play a little 
[01:26:00]  song here though and i want to make it perfectly clear this has nothing to do with 50 cent oh i don't  want to be involved with the rap wars are you thinking opie is going to get involved in i don't want  someone to get confused out there because look let's face it xm is in all the escalates okay that's  true there's a lot of escalates out there listening to our uh program well at least in april there will  be i don't see 50 and all them ordering the premium channels we had a uh we had a very honest 
[01:26:30]  discussion about the hip-hop community and 50 cent and we read his review sounds like his album's  gonna be terrific you're you're giving it a thumbs up sounds like it's gonna be a terrific cd  ah now what about the other side that doesn't like fitty now you're you're maybe getting them a  little pissed off oh i would just remain neutral all right i'm neutral if this is what you're into  all right i'm neutral here it's good i hear it's good but uh i don't uh i don't really go for it that  it looks like it's going to be a terrific cd i'm going to line up with fitty i mean i'm looking forward 
[01:27:00]  to the big drop um i understand that also the uh it's being kind of coincided to do at the same time  is the new jim norton cd oh that's kind of what 50 was thinking that he wanted our cds to kind of  drop at the same time do you diss other comics on there yeah talk about boss's teeth yo yo rich  boss you got teeth like mr ed and he by dissing me he doesn't shoot me he just goes onto my blog and  writes with his fucking horrible retarded boy grammar and then people think that i am also stupid 
[01:27:30]  that's how boss gets me back uh can you imagine if there was comic wars that'd be hilarious  yo bob kelly you're a sucker why don't you go to the hotel you sink fucker  well b  it wasn't bad it rhymed yeah rhymes got missing fuck  so this has nothing to do with 50 cent i'm just i just want to play a piece of a song i don't like  this what is this from another rapper that's all okay gangsta fact 
[01:28:00]  oh can we wait a while to play that that's a bad segue huh i just want to i just want to  separate myself from uh our discussion to to move into another thing which is another rap song  by a rap artist called gangsta fag that's all good luck to you but i'm saying not only is this  you're teetering on being dangerous but this is very gay well that's why i want to make it  perfectly clear it has nothing to do with the last 20 minutes of our program all right opie

What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all appointments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I mean, I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath. 
[01:32:30]  And begin.  Fix it.  Fix it.  I'm over here now.  Back again.  Nice cake, Pete.  Back.  Bag it.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man.  Back again.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Back again. 
[01:33:00]  Guess who's back.  Celebrate.  Oh, gosh.  Hey.  Guess who's back.  Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess who's back.  Ready to go?  Back.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What?  What's all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me.  So, everybody.  Just follow me.  Because we need a little way.  Because it feels so empty.  Without me. 
[01:33:30]  I'm saying.  This looks like a job for me.  So, everybody.  Just follow me.  Because we need a little way.  Because it feels so empty.  Without me.  Get in there.  Okay, Carton.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  M202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I'm here. 
[01:34:00]  We're going to be broadcasting live for St. Paddy's Day.  Hi.  Do we have details on that yet?  Hi.  Because that's only a week away or so, right?  Ten days away, more or less?  Yeah.  I think we're going to do something at the Hard Rock Cafe here in New York City. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  Broadcasting live from 7 to 11 or something.  What day of the week is that?  I don't know.  Maybe we can get some details rolling in.  Steve?  St. Paddy's Day?  What day of the week is that, Steve?  Thursday, March 17th.  Why are you handing me something?  Oh, dude.  I can't talk today.  You do it.  Oh.  I'm just hanging out here today.  Oh, I thought you were...  No.  Is this official?  This is definitely going down?  Yeah.  Thursday, March 17th from the Hard Rock Cafe, 7 to 11 a.m.  We'll be doing a live show.  Oh, two weeks from today, Anthony. 
[01:35:00]  Very good.  Now, I'm hearing that you can't start drinking beer until 8.  8 in the morning?  I think that's what Johnny Hard Rock said.  Is that the rules?  Yeah, the law is you can't start drinking until 8, so they've got an hour buffer before  they can start pounding.  So, we'll start the show at 7.  We're going to do the show in front of everybody?  I guess so, yeah.  Live at the Hard Rock.  That's a little strange.  We're not good at that.  No, we are.  We've got to get some things going on, though, for the Hard Rock.  Yeah, we do.  We need some entertainment for the listeners, or else they just stare at us. 
[01:35:30]  They'll just stare and drink beer and puke on us.  Stare at you.  They try to carry on conversations while you're doing the show.  How about that guy?  Whenever we have some of our listeners around, they'll try to talk to you while you're doing  the show.  Like, I'm here speaking to Opie.  There'll be some guy off to my right, like, waving his hand and talking to me.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm busy here.  I'm doing a show.  I'm doing a show for the whole country, and you want me to talk to you?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:36:00]  So, all right.  Well, that's going to be exciting.  Yeah.  We're hoping for a nice turnout two weeks from today.  And Boston broadcast coming.  Thank you, Ben.  Ooh.  Also, speaking of the Hard Rock, Friday, this Friday, Brother Joe, U2 band, going to be  down at the Hard Rock.  I'm going to go check that out.  So, what is it, Friday at 10?  Oh, to you and Evolution, the doubleheader.  The Brother Joe doubleheader.  You get to see the U2 cover band and the Journey cover band. 
[01:36:30]  Do we have a taste of the Journey cover band?  That just amazes me.  It absolutely amazes me.  At the Hard Rock Cafe, free admission.  Festivities start at 10 p.m. this Friday at the Hard Rock.  And, yeah, wow.  That's where Joe gets up.  And he's like, I guess, Ross Valerie from Journey, the bass player.  And then, all of a sudden, he stops.  Hey, another band comes up.  Look, he's the Edge. 
[01:37:00]  He's the Edge from U2.  He tries to look like the Edge, too.  Well, he puts a little wool cap on.  He puts the Edge thing.  He's bought all Edge's equipment, so the guitar sound is impeccable.  They're getting booked everywhere with the U2 band.  It's amazing.  And the Journey band, it's...  Yeah, Hugo Valenti.  He's the guy that is the singer.  Yeah.  And he's a dead ringer for Steve Perry and sounds like him.  It's pretty cool. 
[01:37:30]  That's the cover band.  That's not really Journey.  Isn't that amazing?  And that's Joe on guitar, no?  Yeah.  Or does he play...  Oh, you said he plays bass?  He plays bass in the...  I don't even know what he does in the Journey band anymore.  I think he's bass in that band.  All right.  And then guitar. 
[01:38:00]  Stone in Love.  I remember that one.  You would swear this is Journey.  Yeah.  All live harmony, so you can all sing.  It's just like seeing Journey.  Well, Hugo looks just like Steve Perry, too. 
[01:38:30]  I know.  He's got the moves down, the expressions.  He's always looked just like the guy.  It's creepy.  When you're lost in deep despair, you just ask the lonely.  When you're feeling the arms of the land, you just ask the lonely.  When you're lost...  It's like right on the money.  I know.  I have this idea.  I want to do like Battle of the Cover Bands.  Battle of the Cover...  Will there be gunfire in the cover band community?  You know, it's disrespectful. 
[01:39:00]  We should get...  The best cover bands in America and have one big, huge contest.  Yeah.  When we get off the premium, we're going to be exposed to a lot more people.  I think we should start getting that going.  Sort of an American idol for cover bands?  Why not, man?  That would be fine, because some of them are goofs.  Some of them are really good, talented.  They know how to do it.  And others are such a goof.  And they really think they're the person.  Yeah, they take it very seriously.  Yes.  If you want to get a lot of people...  How about this?  First prize is $50. 
[01:39:30]  Ooh.  $50.  Hey, hey, hey, where are you scraping that up?  That's right.  I'm trying to find one more hit.  Where's the hit?  Let me...  Oh...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...  Euch'11 is Peter Dodd. 
[01:40:00]  Thankfully...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...  Gracally...  don't see out.  Oh, oh...  Faithfully...  Faithfully...  cortex...  It's ridiculous.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...  It really is, man.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:40:30]  Come on, is there a better cover band out there than the Journey cover band?  Dude, with the exception of Sabra Cadabra, they are the best cover band I've ever heard.  Well, have them send something in.  We'll listen to it on the air.  That's what these bands could do.  They could start sending in their music.  Cover bands?  Yeah.  Tribute bands?  That's a great idea.  If you think you have a better cover band than what you just heard from Journey, or what's  the name of it?  Evolution.  Evolution, yeah.  Because you need that tie-in to the band.  They're always named something that you can identify the band with. 
[01:41:00]  But Joe's making a lot of money off the U2 cover band.  Yes, which is called 2U.  2U.  Wait a minute, that's U2?  Here's a sample of 2U.  All right.  Ant's brother, Joe's band.  Live performance. 
[01:41:30]  Live performance.  Hey, Joe, can you guys try taping through the soundboard?  Rerun got a better tape of the Doobie Brothers jumping up and down. 
[01:42:00]  Because I've seen them live in Boston, and I hate U2, and they sound exactly like U2.  If you like U2, you'll love them.  I don't like U2.  But even I knew they sounded like them.  Yeah, I mean, they're much better than this. 
[01:42:30]  This is a real bad mix of the band.  It's a live show.  Yeah, I understand.  The singer's got the whole Bono thing down.  Oh, that's really good. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, that's really good.  Yeah, all right.  Well, there you go.  If you have a cover band and you think you could beat, especially the Journey that we were playing,  then send it in.  And somehow we'll start some kind of competition down the road.  Patrick's checking in, telling me that my brother plays guitar in both bands now.  He used to play bass in Evolution, but now he's on the lead guitar. 
[01:43:30]  And Patrick knows this because he's going out with my sister.  Ah, very nice.  Is she taken?  Yeah, sure.  She's very attractive.  A little donny.  Hey, shut up.  I would be very respectful.  In the radio community, you don't talk to people about their family like that.  She's really hot.  Slinging lead.  Anthony's got a really hot sister and a really hot mom.  Hey, Jesus.  I mean.  Hey, hey.  Oh, what?  What happened?  I have to mention a pretty dishy brother. 
[01:44:00]  Watch out, motherfucker.  Yeah.  I'm my cat.  Extremely hot, I must say.  There you go.  Very, you know what, you know, wong, wong, wong.  Jesus.  Don't do with a wong, wong, wong.  Not the wong, wong, wong.  Finger through the hole.  I saw that.  My God, man.  Hey, Vic, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  You tell us.  Hey, man.  What's going on, sweet cheeks?  Welcome to the program, Vic.  Thanks, honey.  Hey, I was just calling because, speaking of tribute bands, I don't know if you guys 
[01:44:30]  are new or not, but I think it was 2000, New Year's or Christmas, Great White actually  did a tribute to Led Zeppelin called Great Zeppelin.  And if you ever get a chance, I've got the stuff.  I can send it to you if you want.  But if you can find it, he is, I mean, if you didn't know, you'd think it was Led Zeppelin.  I mean, he's got that voice.  Well, we're going to go into our Gillette and see if we can get a taste of Great White doing  Zeppelin.  Great White also did a tribute to Jimi Hendrix.  Yes, not to mention if I went to the Towering Inferno. 
[01:45:00]  That's awful.  I'm doing a great version of fire right here, too.  Yeah, that's the joke I had before Jimi stepped on me with his own fire joke.  But I didn't step on you.  I let you finish it.  I just didn't get it.  I thought maybe they did it.  Oh, give me baby.  I'm going to leave.  People were asking where they could find the Brother Joe U2 and Evolution thing.  It's the Hard Rock, Friday at 10, this Friday, at the Hard Rock in New York, free admission.  You going to be there yet? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I'm going to check that out.  Yeah, we'll check that out, right?  All right, here's Great White doing a little Zeppelin, a little taste.  It's better than Robert Plant ever could sing this song, by the way.  You've heard this version?  Plant's live voice closed.  Yeah, this guy does a great job. 
[01:46:00]  It's every note.  I'm going to say that you know I'm going to leave you.  The door is locked.  The door is locked.  Mama, if you remember so much, I'm going to leave you alone, but summer comes rolling. 
[01:46:30]  Leave me when my summer comes on.  Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I don't want to leave you. 
[01:47:00]  I'm going to tell you.  Yeah, I'm going to leave you alone.  And I'm going to leave you alone.  Oh, yeah.  Baby, baby, baby, I'm believing.  But you've got to remember.  I can hear you calling me the way you would do. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I can hear you calling me back home.  You'd never get that out of plants.  Wow.  That's unbelievable.  You'd never get that out of Robert's plants, even in his heyday.  All right, there you go, a little taste.  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  Great wife doing some Zeppelin.  So if you have a cover band and you want to show off what you guys can do, 
[01:48:00]  or you know of a cover band, get in touch with them for us, okay?  And you can send your CDs to Opie and Anthony, cover bands, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York.  Really?  That's the zip code?  I thought we were giving out another zip code.  Yeah, 100, what?  10019, right, Hawk?  10019.  Basically, it's the same address that you send in your self-addressed stamped envelopes for the WOW stickers,  which is up on opiananthony.com, okay? 
[01:48:30]  There's a Billy Joel cover band called Big Shot.  That's a cover guy.  Yeah.  Isn't that just a cover guy?  Whoa, hey, hey.  And they try to look like the guy.  There's websites that are really funny.  We should troll a few and pluck some songs off, because there's some really funny ones, like Billy Joel, or what's his name?  Love on the Rocks.  Neil Diamond.  Yeah, Neil Diamond.  There's plenty of Neil Diamond ones. 
[01:49:00]  And they are really bad.  They come out with a bad wig on and stuff.  Oh, awful.  The shirt button down to the belly button.  Some real bad ones.  All right, Anthony.  You know what my favorite cover band is?  Yes.  Sabra Cadabra.  I know.  Sabra Cadabra.  Sabra Cadabra.  Great.  Yeah, I know there's a band called Dread Zeppelin.  Yeah, we know that.  Reggae Zeppelin songs.  Is it good, or does it stink?  No, they're all right.  If you're into reggae Zeppelin. 
[01:49:30]  Yes, Ben?  There's a Neil Diamond band, Super Diamond.  They sell out, like, everywhere.  They do big...  Super Diamond?  They're called Super Diamond, I think it is.  Yeah, and they sell out, like, Irving Plaza here in New York.  Oh, yeah.  They sell out like crazy.  All these things.  ABBA cover bands and Hart cover bands.  They sell out.  People want to see this crap.  All right, moving on.  Most of the time, the cover band does the song better than the real band when they go out touring  in their later years.  The cover band's doing better than they...  I used to love the Doors tribute bands. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  There were a bunch of those growing up on Long Island.  Bo Hulse.  Big, fat version of the Doors.  Great.  I remember one where...  I think I saw it, like, at Southampton College or something, and Outdoors, and the band's  on stage, right?  The Doors.  They're starting with L.A. Woman or something like that, so it's a long intro.  That was one of the bands.  They were called L.A. Woman.  So maybe it was L.A. Woman.  I don't even know.  And all of a sudden, you're wondering where the lead singer is.  Yeah.  And he's being carried from the back of the crowd on a door, completely, like, drunk and 
[01:50:30]  looking just like Jim Morrison.  Stop it.  It was hilarious.  And they just dump him on the stage, and he gets up and just sounds exactly like Jim Morrison.  Dumped him on the stage?  I literally just dumped him.  I remember one Doors act, and they had a ladder in the back of the stage, and he would sing  Mr. Mojo Rise In and climb up the ladder.  Yeah.  I know.  It was hard enough for me to just say that.  He should sing the end while somebody chops his back with a machete. 
[01:51:00]  There's an Aerosmith cover band.  The guy looks just like Steven Tyler.  Yeah, it's called Draw the Line.  Yeah.  Dead on.  Well, we'd like to hear some of these bands, so get us some of their stuff, and then maybe  we'll get some huge competition going.  I tell you, $50 first prize up.  I'm not even joking.  I'll tell you right now, I don't think anyone would beat Joe's Journey band.  That's pretty good.  That's what I say.  The look is there, the sound.  That's what you need in a good cover band. 
[01:51:30]  Good tribute band.  All right, Anthony, in the post today, there's a very interesting story about Michael Jackson.  Oh, another one.  Yeah, well, every day, I mean, there's another story about Michael Jackson.  The trial's going on.  How's the trial going?  Anyone, like, paying attention to that damn thing?  No surprises.  It's the prosecution saying this is a predatorial animal that has been going after kids for years  and getting away with it, and the defense is saying no surprises there either.  They're just saying the parents are money-hungry gold diggers that were using Michael Jackson, 
[01:52:00]  and Michael Jackson is the victim.  That's pretty much it.  And I don't know what proof either side has, but they've been going back and forth with this for a couple of days now.  Once the witnesses really get up there and start yapping, unless you get one of those real big moments where some kid comes out  and points at Michael Jackson and goes, that freak touched me, I don't know.  It's up in the air.  I don't know.  Usually you can kind of gauge whether he's going to go to jail or not, but not this time.  Unless they have DNA evidence, I think he walks. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, I think he walks.  Supposedly they have a lot of verbal evidence, you know, a lot of testimony from kids that they're going to say,  this guy had us drinking, there was some oral sex, some touching, so good luck to you.  Let me ask you a question.  Leno is being a lawyer for Jay Leno, asked the court to exempt the late-night funny man from a witness gag order  so he can continue cracking trial jokes.  Why is he a witness?  Did anybody know, were they just doing that to keep him quiet on the late-night TV? 
[01:53:00]  No, no, no, no.  The mother of the victim went to Leno.  How's the story, though?  Asked for money.  Michael Jackson isn't the only person that she tried to get money out of.  Oh, okay.  That's what the defense is going after.  There have been some celebrities that they had gotten money from.  She was going around with her sick kid saying, we need money, and getting money,  and then using it for DVD players, vacations, cars, things like that.  And Jay Leno is one of those people that were approached, so I guess they're going to call him as a witness. 
[01:53:30]  But he's got to go on the Tonight Show every night and do jokes, and Michael Jackson's case is huge,  so it's kind of cramping his style.  So they're looking to not have him be under this gag order.  Do you have that Leno joke?  Yeah, we've got Leno's monologue.  We'll play it into break.  I love Leno, man.  But first, here's a story coming out of the Daily News, Russian Molloy.  Jacko and Chimptail, it gets hairy.  Jacko.  Where did that come from? 
[01:54:00]  Chimptail.  Is that a post thing, or is that an English mirror thing?  Well, this is the Daily News.  Wacko Jacko.  I read that.  I forget where it came from.  They all just come up with their wacky title.  But Jacko's huge.  Yeah, I know.  Where Jacko?  He loved it at first, I heard, because he got to give him publicity, and negative press is good.  Now he must hate seeing it.  Jacko.  You know it's not like Jacko sells out another stadium, or Jacko's album goes triple platinum.  Look at this face.  He soaks himself in bleach.  He should just be shot. 
[01:54:30]  Sick of him.  He should be shot for bleach in his skin?  He's just a self-hating weirdo.  Enough already.  I liked him back in the days when he was doing...  And you are...  Making a living being a self-hating weirdo.  Self-hating weirdo.  All right.  Also a pasty white nothing.  Point taken.  All right.  But the bottom line is he fucks kids and I...  All right.  All right.  You raise a good point. 
[01:55:00]  I apologize.  I started thinking he might be your hero.  Wow.  All right.  Well, the Daily News...  Listen to this story.  It's unbelievable.  The sex charges against Michael Jackson grow more...  Beastly?  Beastly?  Beastly by the day.  Beastly?  Listen to this one.  Just when you thought the King of Pops reputation couldn't sink any lower...  Beastly?  It turns out...  Huh?  Is it beastly?  Uh...  Probably bestial.  I guarantee there's an eye in there.  Beastial.  Beastial.  I can't even see the article.  All right.  Beastial.  The sex charges against Michael Jackson grow more bestial by the day. 
[01:55:30]  Just when you thought the King of Pops reputation couldn't sink any lower...  It turns out Jackson's former brother-in-law, James DeBarge, has claimed the singer was  up to some inappropriate monkey business with his chimp.  Monkey business with his chimp.  This guy who was married to Janet Jackson for a while says some crazy stuff.  He basically saw Michael Jackson, all right?  And he says he was changing Bubbles' diapers and just got carried away. 
[01:56:00]  Stop it.  DeBarge said in a 1993 interview, which we've obtained.  DeBarge added that during the alleged incident, Bubbles, who was just a baby, had a smile  on his face.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  The musician said Michael would call the trainer and have him bring Bubbles over to spend the  night once in a while when he wanted some company.  Bubbles dropped out of sight several years ago, prompting rumors that Jackson's father,  Joe Jackson, shot the chimp after he caught him in bed with his son. 
[01:56:30]  Are you kidding me?  This is in the Daily News today.  But this isn't the Weekly World News.  This is a legitimate newspaper.  How do you know which one to shoot?  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  That is not right.  That's not what you think.  Oh, okay.  Then it's funny.  Yes.  But yesterday, California animal trainer Bob Dunn confirmed to us that the chimp was in  his care.  He's in his 20s, said Dunn, who still works with Jackson, and he's doing fine. 
[01:57:00]  Mm.  But, uh...  Diddling with the chimp?  Well, that's what John Jackson's old husband there is claiming.  Wow.  That is some allegation.  Claiming that he, uh, he had some fun with the chimp.  Oh.  Poor little chimp tear rolling down his little chimp cheek.  Like an Indian looking at garbage.  Just wants to be bounced around and maybe have a banana, maybe land on a pillow and be  tickled. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Nothing like what Michael was doing.  All of a sudden, the chimp's like, you know, I know when something's wrong and this is it.  Yeah.  You know, this isn't fun anymore.  Why is he shaving my ass?  I'm not a baboon.  Let's say hi to Mike at Hoboken.  Mike?  What's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  What's up, butter nipples?  Hey, Mike from Hoboken.  Thanks for calling the program.  No problem.  Bashir might have his own documentary thrown out as evidence because he wouldn't answer  four questions to the judge, so he might also be held in contempt of court. 
[01:58:00]  Who, the guy that made the documentary?  Yeah.  Oh, he's not answering some questions?  He's not answering how long he taped for, uh, and there's, I don't, to be honest with  you, I don't even remember the other three questions that he didn't answer.  I just read it yesterday, thought I might give you a tidbit, and now I'm going to punch  you.  You're hearing it here first from me.  This case will just be thrown out of court.  I don't know.  They seem to have a lot of evidence this time.  Nah, this is, uh, something, something's going to pop. 
[01:58:30]  I'm telling you.  It already did.  I thought it was his zipper when a youngster walked in.  Monkey's ass.  Oof.  Well, as we go to break, you were talking about Leno.  Yes.  Here's his Michael Jackson stuff.  And can I say, this is why I love Leno, because the rest of these late night faggots  never would do a pedophile joke.  This is NBC, and Leno's doing a pedophile joke.  This is a little cutting edge.  Dude, he's fucking a real comic.  Yeah.  I really mean, I love him for that. 
[01:59:00]  Try that on, on CBS.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, no Michael Jackson jokes.  They don't like victims.  Man, you're obsessed with the Letterman thing.  I don't hate Letterman.  I just despise the standards they put for comedians.  They used to make comics wear suits.  You know, a band can come on wearing a fucking, you know, a severed skull attached to their  shoulder, and as a comedian, you know, go ahead, Bubbles, go up there and tap dance  in a suit.  You had to wear a suit?  Real love for the art.  Wow.  I thought they just wore the suit.  Oh, yeah, because that's how comics want to dress.  Yeah.  Like fucking Undertakers. 
[01:59:30]  Let me just say hi to Julie.  Hey, Julie, what's up?  Hey.  What's going on?  I just, I just wanted to call.  I wrecked my car last week, and I haven't had XM.  Oh, yeah?  And I miss you guys so much.  Thank you.  I can't even deal.  Thank you.  I was listening to you guys back in AEW, and I've told you that before, but, oh my God,  I'm miserable.  Like, every day, I come running home, and I'm like, yelling at my husband, what went 
[02:00:00]  on?  What went on?  And, like, he just keeps me in suspense just to piss me off.  Well, when are you going to get a new vehicle?  Well, I'm waiting for it to get fixed.  Oh, fixed.  What happened?  You back over a dog?  No, I ran into a guardrail the other day in the snow.  You chicks can't drive worth a shit, man, especially in the snow.  No, you know what, though?  Like, two people, two guys after me ran over the same ice and did the same thing.  Ah, black ice.  That's because you were there in front of them.  No, I was gone already.  I left. 
[02:00:30]  What happened?  You were going around a curve.  It's all icy, and you figured you'd still do 30?  No, I was actually on the Taconic just driving along, and it went into a guardrail.  I don't know, honey.  I told her husband, and he's just like, oh, God, again.  You know, so I just took off and went to the police station, and then after I turned around.  How many wrecks have you had in your driving career?  How many?  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Two.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  Two.  Well, my husband's wrecked more than I have.  How about that?  All right.  Well, Julie, thanks.  We appreciate that.  No problem.  Are you listening today?  You're listening today?  No, I'm listening to you on the phone.  Oh, that sucks.  You missed some great radio already.  I know.  I haven't turned you guys off since you've been on in October.  I mean, like, I haven't even explored any other channels on XM. 
[02:01:30]  Remember Don and Mike?  Oh, God.  Well, Don, this is one of the big stories we're talking about today.  Don ran over his little doggie.  In the driveway.  Oh, shit.  Yep.  Killed his little doggie so he couldn't do his radio show.  Dog killer.  Backed over his dog.  My mom hit our cat.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the cat ran into the tire as she was backing out.  I can think of another dog I'd like run over with a little black circle eye.  How great would it be to see that little fucking awful thing backed over in a driveway? 
[02:02:00]  Which one?  Maybe that's what happened to Lester.  Oh.  Because his body got kicked.  That little dog.  Faggity cartoon little character.  Look, guys.  Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  Yuck.  All right, Julie.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Shit, heads.  I remember once my mom was in the driveway starting up the old Mustang, and we heard  thud.  I was like, what the hell is that?  Popped the hood of our car, and there was a cat sleeping on the engine.  Oh, because it was warm.  Yeah, and the fan, the radiator fan smacked its spine and almost cut it in two. 
[02:02:30]  Did it die?  It was just, of course it did.  It was just laying there.  My mother's all freaked out.  It wasn't our cat, so I didn't give a shit.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, back to Leno.  Talking about Michael Jackson last night.  Well, let's see.  Opening arguments have begun in the Michael Jackson trial.  And the prosecution, for some reason, today ripped into Jude Law.  Why?  He's so unfair.  What did he do?  You know, why go after him?  Well, it's interesting. 
[02:03:00]  Boy, they got right into it.  The prosecuting attorney, Tom Seddon, said that Jackson presided over Neverland as a kind  of haven for adolescent boys who are allowed to skip school, drink alcohol, view pornography,  and stay up all night.  You know, you take Michael out of the picture, that's not a bad deal.  You know, I would go there now.  You know, I hadn't thought of going to Neverland before, but now.  Sounds good to me.  Actually, Michael was furious when he heard these allegations.  At one point, he became so angry, he actually got some color in his face. 
[02:03:30]  It was amazing.  Oh, and the British journalist, Martin Bashir, this guy's kind of sleazy, too.  He's the guy who did the documentary on Michael called Living with Michael Jackson.  Well, he could be facing a jail sentence now for being in contempt of court after refusing  to answer questions from Jackson's attorneys, which is kind of ironic.  So Bashir's next documentary could be Living in Prison with Michael Jackson.  I mean, wouldn't he have got the same cell? 
[02:04:00]  That'd be kind of funny.  Yeah, well.  You know all the allegations, and Michael Jackson claims that his partners would sleep in the  bed while he slept on the floor.  You know, it's the same arrangement that Clintons have.  You know, basically.  Basically, the same.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And as you may have heard, I have been named as a possible witness in the Michael Jackson  club.  Actually, I am not going to speak at the trial. 
[02:04:30]  No?  No, no.  What I'm going to do is tell my story with the help of some anatomically correct dolls.  That's what I do.  It'll make it easier for me.  Have you seen the celebrity list?  It looks like a bad Cannonball Run movie.  It's like Elizabeth Taylor.  It's only stars from the...  And do you see how they're going to be questioning the celebrities?  Well, take a look.  Show today.  From Santa Maria, California, it's the Michael Jackson Tribe. 
[02:05:00]  Starring Larry King.  Stevie Wonder.  Elizabeth Taylor.  Diana Ross.  Kobe Bryant.  Lori Povich.  Deepak Chopra.  Nick Carter.  And center square, Jay Leno.  I want to thank my agent for getting me that center square.  That's the one you want. 
[02:05:30]  And today, Michael Jackson's lawyers tried to portray Michael as the victim.  Well, you can understand that.  I mean, one of these 12-year-old boys is going to learn no means no.  You know what I'm saying?  For to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the Fruit Roll-Up Factory, making the Fruit Roll-Up.  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that are so much better than your American...  Because I... 
[02:06:00]  You know...  What do you...  Let me just...  Well, you already know, but...  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right.  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad.  You fat American.  Right.  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should, uh, need to know.  Okay, back to work.  7-2-0-2.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sushi! 
[02:06:30]  Seek and destroy!  Seek and destroy!  Seek and destroy!  Seek and destroy!  Tomorrow on the program, Anthony.  The debut of the Vag Pump. 
[02:07:00]  No way, that's tomorrow?  The debut of the Vag Pump on the Opie and Anthony program tomorrow.  We discovered this little device while we were out in Las Vegas for the porn convention.  And the fine people that make the Vag Pump gave us one to use.  And, of course, Martini Steve is lining up the girls as we speak.  Nice!  Stop it.  Kick-ass production.  Where is he going to get these girls?  I don't know.  Let's get Steve in here if we can.  Because this is like a, this isn't something you just invite some girl in off the street to do. 
[02:07:30]  This Vag Pump, we saw, uh, pictures of the results of it when we were in Vegas.  And, oh, my God.  Big, just nasty, swollen, red, bloody mess.  Nice.  Mmm.  Steve was in Don Geronimo's driveway, too.  You got girls lined up for the Vag Pump for tomorrow?  Oh, yeah.  It certainly looks like it.  I'm praying to God they don't get freaked out.  Oh, boy.  How many?  Well, pitching, uh, supposedly three.  Have they ever done anything like that? 
[02:08:00]  No, and that's why I'm crossing my fingers.  Because these chicks tend to flake whenever, you know, they get faced with this.  You know, the initial response is, yeah, sure, it sounds like fun.  And as they start to see pictures and video, they go,  they understand what this entails.  Yeah, well, I, you know, exactly.  It's, it's, you send them pictures, and it's not like this thing is supposed to be painful.  Every video I've ever seen of this thing in action is, uh, is, features a woman moaning in ecstasy,  so I'm assuming it feels good.  Ah.  Yeah, I, where did you get the pump? 
[02:08:30]  Uh, Jeff from, uh, Kick-Ass gave me the thing.  And it was, he gave it to Norton and I when we were at dinner that one night in L.A.,  and we tried it out on our arms.  You did?  Yeah.  Did you raise a hickey?  Yeah, exactly.  You did.  Oh, that's what you told your wife.  What?  Ah, it attacked my neck.  Yeah, and my ball bag.  Um, yeah, it's, it looks like, um, like a plastic version of, um, what the hell are those masks?  Like an oxygen mask.  Yeah, thank you.  A plastic little oxygen mask, but it's transparent and plexiglass, and you put it on the, uh, you know, 
[02:09:00]  the vads.  The vads, yeah, thanks.  All right, I was trying to skate around it.  What if it sucks the whole womb out?  It doesn't do that.  No, it just, you know, it just forms a vacuum and makes the skin puff up.  It makes it really, really sensitive, apparently.  And you know what's working when the head and face start to get, like, shrunken?  Yeah, it's like pulling her head into her neck.  When her ears are at shoulder level, stop pumping.  So we're, you know, we've got some girls lined up, and we can always take more.  Who are they? 
[02:09:30]  Uh, they are...  Are they porn chicks, I mean?  Yes, yes.  Is it plug-in or batteries?  No, it's, um, it's not, it's not powered, but it's just, it's got a pump on it.  Oh, it's got a hand pump.  It's got, like, a little hand pump, and it looks like a tire gauge on top.  Really?  And you just kind of pump the air out?  What, what does it tell you to pump it down to a certain level, and then you leave it?  No, this didn't come with any instructions.  No instructions?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you just slap it on.  You slap it on, form a tight seal, and just pump, pump, pump until the skin starts to raise up,  and then you, you know, wait a little bit until it gets a little comfortable,  and then you do it a little bit more, and then a little bit more. 
[02:10:00]  Disgusting, man.  Oh, we're going to see, who the hell came up with this one?  Yeah.  Look at Jimmy.  I got a rod.  It's so hot.  Oh, God.  It is not hot.  It's not hot.  That one's, the final result is, uh, quite disturbing.  Oh, it looks like Bubbles' ass after Michael Jackson's done with it.  It does.  It kind of looks like puffy.  Red and puffy.  Mandrill ass.  Do you want some girls to just show up tomorrow?  Yeah, please.  Maybe some girl just walking off the street as well?  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  A regular girl?  Yep.  That'd be cool.  Girls can't be shy. 
[02:10:30]  Like, put that across.  You can't come in here and be shy about something like this.  This is, we're going to see your snatch.  It's not going to hurt, either.  Relax.  It's not, there's no plug-ins, like he said.  It's just silly.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  And maybe Patrice can come in with his fuck swing,  and we can, uh, just, you know, push you around the room and put lamps in your ass.  Something else that he'd enjoy.  Sexual sociopath.  Glass dildos.  I can't wait to get Patrice back on the program.  Oh, yeah.  Gotta see a filth bag.  But tomorrow, it's the vag pump on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  God willing.  I don't know if I want to see this.  I do.  I want to see it, but, I don't know, it does nothing for me as far as being a sexual thing.  It's like a freak show kind of thing.  I want to see it, but it's not going to be like Jimmy, where he's adjusting himself,  thinking about it.  All right.  Keeping clear stuff.  And people will be able to check out some pictures and video?  Oh, yes, they will.  Oh, yes, they will.  Speaking of which, how's Rate My Wow going?  It's going very well.  It's going very well.  Jeff pulled an all-nighter, got every picture up, so I've got to thank him for that. 
[02:11:30]  And then we got, like, four new ones overnight.  So, yeah, Steve Starr, a new website, ratemywow.com.  It's linked to all the other websites, and basically, it's all the old photos of girls flashing us, right?  Yeah.  It's just all the old wow photos of just boobs and wow pictures and, you know, pears and, you know, several boobs,  and it's just great.  But, yeah, that was one I, maybe last night, I had to have some fun with Photoshop.  Wait, you did that one?  Yeah.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I put Don's face on Cruella DeVille's body. 
[02:12:00]  It's a new movie, A Hundred Dalmatians?  Oh, and that one, too.  I was a little bored last night, so I jumped on Photoshop.  Yeah.  It's Casey Kasem popping out of the hedges at Don's house with a dead dog laying in the driveway.  And Casey's saying, how the hell can he come out of a goddamn up-tempo number into a goddamn dog dying?  Yeah, you've got to go to whackbag.com and go to Photoshop.  There's always some good Photoshop's going on every day that have something to do with the program, so.  All right, so ratemywow.com's going well. 
[02:12:30]  And you go on there, you check out the topless girls, and then you rate them and stuff, right?  Yeah, exactly, and guys, stop sending in pictures of yourselves.  That's really awful.  Guys are sending in pictures.  Guys are sending in pictures.  What's wrong with guys?  Dorm rooms holding up big wow stickers.  No, no, it's defeating the purpose.  Like, every other picture is of boobs, and some dope in his dorm room is sending me a picture of himself.  I don't want to see that.  Hey, click on, go up, up, up.  No, no, I said up.  Up, he said.  Down, down, down, down, down, right there. 
[02:13:00]  From a distance, though.  Wow.  That could be, like, as far as big boobs go, that could be the nicest set of big boobs I've ever seen, man.  I saw the little thumbnail from a distance, and they really stood out.  And she's from Cleveland, it looks like, right?  Those look familiar.  Like, have you ever been on the show?  You know, I could tell you, like, some of the girls' names by just looking at their boobs.  Yeah, she looks like one of the girls that were on the show.  That's quite impressive, yes. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  So there's plenty of boobs to check out at ratemywow.com.  Yeah, go back and look at all the thumbnails.  There's plenty of them.  Oh, wait.  You know, I was going to play.  All right, hold on.  Tell Steve-O to hang out there for one second.  He might go.  Steve-O was supposed to call us around, I don't know, 6 this morning.  Well, get him.  And he's finally calling in from Los Angeles.  Steve-O.  Yeah, dude.  What happened to you, man?  You were supposed to call, like, two hours ago.  Well, that shit, man.  You know what?  I told your guy that he was better off calling me because I was a wreck. 
[02:14:00]  What happened?  Why?  Oh, nothing, man.  Like, I was in love with you.  And I feel pretty unaccountable for what I say on digital radio.  Right.  I was in the middle of a big drug binge.  Oh, what were you taking?  Well, I got snowed in in West L.A.  Snowed in.  Wow, he loves the coke.  But, yeah, so then, I don't know. 
[02:14:30]  Like, I had a car on a wild weekend.  Then my necessary hibernation went down.  And then I found out that I had to film this morning some stuff.  I'm going to be on Jay Leno on the 9th.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  What are you going to do on Jay?  It's my fourth time on Jay Leno.  I'm really psyched.  What are you doing?  Are you on his show?  Well, we'll play some clips.  I've filmed one special for Jay Leno. 
[02:15:00]  They're going to load up a kiddie full of alligators.  And I had to frolic around in the pool until I get bit.  Yeah, I've seen you get bit by alligators.  Pretty funny.  Yeah, and now I'm not, like, you guys went digital radio, right?  Yeah, so like.  And now I'm reduced to a digital TV star.  Because my Wild Boys show is on MTV, too, now. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, it is?  But, yeah, check out how cool the guy I was.  Like, I took, like, a fistful of pills to try to make myself tired early last night, you know?  Yeah.  Because, yeah, except that last minute, I got to film in the morning.  What kind of pills?  Vicodin and Xanax.  Quite a bit of Xanax.  A lot of Xanax, huh? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm in love with that stuff.  Mellows you out?  Yeah, yeah.  It probably makes you tired when you've only been awake for a few hours.  Right.  Yeah.  How have you guys been?  I'm single again.  Remember I was dating that really bad model?  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, I don't know, man.  Now I've been back on the road, and, you know, our relationship just couldn't handle the separation.  I thought you guys were completely in love. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, she was a knockout, man.  She was, like, six foot tall, right?  Yeah.  No, she's amazing, yeah.  She's amazing, but I don't know, dude.  Like, I'm a bachelor.  So, what is it?  Back to D?  Oh, yeah.  Steve-O, you sound really out of it, man.  Yeah, I really am, man.  Like, I was dead asleep when you guys called.  But, you know, I love you guys that much. 
[02:17:00]  Very good, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Aren't you worried about ODing?  Oh, man, no, dude.  Like, actually, I thought I might be pulling kind of a River Phoenix diet.  That's what I was thinking.  And then I was like, yeah.  Wow, dude.  You are so fucked up.  Dude, how are you?  A real three-course River Phoenix meal.  Do you want us to call, I don't know, call someone to help you out? 
[02:17:30]  You sound like you might need some help.  No, no, no, man.  I'm actually really excited, man.  I got Leno coming up on the 9th.  The season premiere of the third season of Wild Boys is premiering on MTV2 on March 11th.  So, that's rad.  And then I got my Steve-O box set comes out March 18th.  And then, I don't know, I got a pretty big month coming up.  So, it's like me to be really high or drunk, but probably both. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, you got to stay alive if you're going to have a really big month, bro.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, and I forgot to say, shit fuck.  Yeah.  There you go.  I'm not allowed to say shit fuck all I want, right?  You can say whatever you want, Steve-O.  Oh, man.  What a pleasure.  Are you going to be all right, though?  Yeah, man.  I'm going to be absolutely fine.  I'm going to go right back to bed, and then I'm going to wake up, and I believe I'm going to be attacked by an animal around 10 a.m. California time. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  You want to tell us about this party?  It sounds like you had a great party, man.  Well, no.  It hasn't really been a party.  I was just trying to get in bed early to be professional, you know, for my filming this morning.  You can barely understand what he's saying.  It sounds like a lot of people are saying he sounds like real-time friends.  I have been one-term rescue with one, literally.  You can't understand that.  Oh, my God.  We were filming Rock Boys in Mexico, and I met this little sweetheart. 
[02:19:00]  So I'm flying her in.  I'm flying in Mexican merchandise.  You've met a Mexican chick, and you're flying her in?  Yep.  She gets there for the afternoon.  Illegal alien?  I don't know how that shit works.  She doesn't know how it works, man.  Before she said.  Oh, okay.  She's a real deal.  She hardly speaks a word of English.  Is she your mule?  Neither do you.  She's speaking international language. 
[02:19:30]  She's got something in common.  Is she your mule?  Yeah, we're going to speak the international language.  I'm probably going to eat her ass.  Yeah, that pretty much.  There's no mistaking that when you're eating ass.  You can't really rule that in the translation.  It's something that I've just recently picked up.  You know, like, I didn't really discover the joys of ass eating.  You know, but girls love it.  They say it.  Let's face it.  Steve-O, how much?  Not a lot of girls are going to ask you to eat their ass. 
[02:20:00]  No, no.  But none of them are going to damn well tell you to stop.  Right, you are.  Steve-O, how much Coke did you have over the weekend?  Oh, and I was just doing it for a couple days.  A couple days straight?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then a handful of pills to get you to go to sleep.  Yeah.  Actually, there were a couple of Coke binges in the last few days.  Turns out that the last few days was quite a long one.  And you don't worry about taking too many sleeping pills or too many Xanaxes? 
[02:20:30]  You know, I actually had a friend recently die, not to make light of it, but, yeah, I can say died of taking alcohol and somas.  And I thought somas were really mellow pills.  But I don't know, you know, like, it's like my attitude about anything else.  You know, like, I drink tap water on every continent, you know, like, just to build my immune system and make it stronger.  Yeah, that's true.  And I think, really, the more pills I keep taking all the time, you know, like, the less likely I'll be to OD.  You know, I'm really just trying to beef up my immune system. 
[02:21:00]  You drank tap water in Africa, didn't you?  Yeah, yeah, Africa, Indonesia.  How crazy is that?  You know, they always deliberately drink tap water.  How bad was the...  If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger.  How bad was the liquid diarrhea?  So, really, I can't say it was too bad.  Hey, you know, I want to tell you guys, man, I feel really honored that, you know, I just got this random call yesterday, 
[02:21:30]  and, you know, you guys said how you missed me, and, you know, like, fuck yeah, man.  I really feel the love, dude.  We love the Steve-O.  We love the Steve-O.  I hope to get out to New York soon, and, boy, will I be a mess.  The last time you were here, you were sleeping in the hall next to the elevator.  Yeah.  Waiting to go on our show.  I was taking it pretty easy.  But, yeah, you know, and then the other morning, it's a little bit tougher.  Back in the good old days when I'd come in there in the afternoon, oh, man, pure gold. 
[02:22:00]  Those were the good old days.  You're right.  I know.  I mean, I'll be really thinking of what to do when I get back in there next time.  Yeah, you've got to come up with something really good.  I'm glad you called and checked in, and over here in Steve-O land, everything's just happy as can be.  Cool, Steve.  Thanks, man.  Hey, Steve-O, before you go, could you say I'm not an animal?  I am not an animal. 
[02:22:30]  There you go.  Thank you, Steve-O.  I'm a very sensitive individual.  Of course he is.  Dude, stay alive.  I'm going to go back to sleep, guys.  I really appreciate you calling to check in on me.  You sure you want to go back to sleep?  If you thought I was wasted last time, wait until you see me tonight.  I think that's what Marilyn Monroe said.  It didn't work out for her.  No.  I'm just going to go back to sleep.  You guys are fantastic, man.  I'll let you know when I come to New York, dude.  All right.  And it's on. 
[02:23:00]  All right, Steve-O.  Hang in there.  All right, man.  All the best, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Steve-O.  Thank you.  All right.  There you go, Steve-O.  There it is.  The last interview with Steve-O.  That could possibly be his final interview.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  This guy is gone.  He is so fucked up.  I wanted to get involved on the Rate My Wow.  I wanted to take a look at it, so I went to Foundry Music.  Okay.  And then I went to Opie and Anthony, and I'll be damned if I could find it anywhere. 
[02:23:30]  There's no link on opieandanthony.com?  Well, maybe on opieandanthony.com.  I went right to Foundry Music.  Isn't it there?  Isn't it hosted on Foundry Music?  And then I go, and I'm looking for it.  I even put in Rate My Wow in the search engine for Foundry, and I came up with no results for Rate My Wow.  It is the hardest site to navigate. 
[02:24:00]  I don't care what Steve C. says about it.  He's re-engineered it.  He's had people work on it.  I can never find anything on Foundry.  Steve.  Steve, where is Rate My Wow on Foundry Music?  Oh, it's actually, we haven't put it up yet.  Oh, well, there you go.  We put it right at the top of opieandanthony.com.  It's one of the top links.  I go to foundrymusic.com when I look for all my Opie and Anthony needs.  Sorry.  But it's on opieandanthony.com.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I just want to clear that up, because I think a lot of people went to Foundry Music looking for it. 
[02:24:30]  I'm sorry.  And if you can't find it right away on Foundry, you just assume that it's lost somewhere, and you spend hours looking for it.  No, you don't get lost anymore.  God, I don't remember signing this girl's boobs.  They're beautiful, too.  No, I don't remember that either.  That's pretty cool.  A lot of boobs.  Very good.  Some nice, some...  Oh, wow.  Hey, look at that.  Hey, Ruck, look at my nose.  That is something you don't see every day.  Anyway.  The torpedoes.  Yeah, check it out for yourself. 
[02:25:00]  RateMyWow.com.  Someone made a song about the new website already.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, it's not the best, but I just thought it was neat, considering we only announced it yesterday.  This guy came up with a song.  All right, let's take a quick listen.  RateMyWow.com.  You're infected.  Now spread the virus.  Here comes the virus.  You're infected.  We have a lot of hip-hoppers that listen to us.  A lot of hip-hop.  What happened to the rockers that used to listen to us?  Every song parody that comes in is a hip-hop thing. 
[02:25:30]  Popular with the brothers.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Take your door.  Let your door.  Let your door.  Get on.  Wear a bar.  Don't make me stall.  Show what you want.  As long as you do.  Make my door.  Doi.  Doi.  Come through.  You're beautiful.  Just look at you.  You know what it is that you need to do. 
[02:26:00]  Wear a bar.  Show your door.  Wear a bar.  Explosive events.  Do what it can get.  Hell it gets out.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  We want to see those brass even if they're a mess.  Now ain't this a boy.  Get off your chest.  Get off your chest.  Let's see those boots.  Watch out, dudes.  We're sick, horny, perverted, twisted, dudes.  Not trying to be rude.  Just lean on the roots.  Make your name so you can provide moods.  So wrap them out.  Show your tits.  Wrap them out.  Explosive events.  Pretty titties. 
[02:26:30]  Pretty titties.  Pretty titties.  Pretty titties.  Pretty titties.  Pretty titties.  Pretty titties.  Show your tits.  Show your motherfucking tits.  Wow.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's what that song needed.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  I don't know what to think of that.  Readmywow.com.  That was from Johnny Five, by the way.  Got a girl in the supermarket holding up a bag of Lay's Wow potato chips and showing her 
[02:27:00]  boobies right there in the supermarket.  Yeah, I'm going to spend some time on this website after the show.  There's some really, really cool wows there.  And Mike from Long Island.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, just want to let you know, I think Steve C screwed up the foundry cut, the promo.  What'd I do?  You spelled it wrong.  Uh, oh, no, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  It just goes real fast.  You sure?  Positive, dude. 
[02:27:30]  I edited it.  It just goes real fast.  Whoa, look at Steve.  I'm a little defensive.  I'm a little defensive.  No, he's not defensive.  He's just wrong.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Hey, where did Jimmy go?  Jimmy left a while ago.  Jimmy had a hard on when we were talking about the vag pump, and then he pointed to his  gut and made the sign of, my tummy hurts, and then he just took off.  He's probably jacking.  He probably got in there, had to take a dump, and he's sitting there going, eh, I gotta  come back.  Sometimes he gets so worked up that he has to go off and jerk off. 
[02:28:00]  He's gotta go and jack it.  We'll see if he's honest with us when he comes back.  He's an addict.  All right, Ant, why don't we take a break, quick break, get into a couple other stories  when we return.  Also, I think, still to come on the show today, Frank Caliendo calling in, and also  The Rock.  The Rock says Dwayne Johnson.  He's not The Rock.  No, he's still The Rock, right?  Playing a gig.  Can he use that name?  Yeah.  How is that possible?  Vince gets a cut every time he uses it.  Oh, that's how it's possible.  Every movie he does, you see at the end, it says WWE films kind of tie into it. 
[02:28:30]  Really?  Yeah.  So he can use The Rock, but he's gotta get...  But Vince, he owns The Rock, but Vince gets a cut of it, too.  Well, The Rock is an interesting guy.  He's playing a gay character on this Be Cool movie.  Oh, is he?  The Get Shorty sequel.  And I guess what happened, WWE just let his contract expire.  Really?  Yeah.  And then, so The Rock isn't part of the WWE anymore, but Vince said it was just an oversight  that they want to work out a new contract with him, right? 
[02:29:00]  I'm sure they want to, but I don't think he wants to.  All he's doing now is special appearances.  He's not wrestling full time.  He'll just show up every now and then.  If I was The Rock, I mean, he was so huge with the WWE, WWF, whatever.  You know, I wouldn't actually wrestle anymore.  No, why bother?  And risk the chance of, you know, getting paralyzed or something.  Bad injury.  He's a big action hero now.  He's an actor.  He's a movie star.  He doesn't need that.  That's right.  I mean, I respect the guys in the WWE, but would you take the big chances that they do if 
[02:29:30]  you're a movie star?  I think they're all gunning to get into the position where they can leave.  Right.  You know?  Enjoy it.  But truth of the matter is, I'm sure they would love to be in The Rock's position where they  get enough popularity that they can move on.  There you go.  All right.  I don't know.  We'll see where Jimmy went and we'll continue in just a bit.  It's the Obi and Anthony show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say . 
[02:30:00]  Oh, it's the, uh, it's the Obi and Anthony. 
[02:30:30]  XM 202.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm not a place over the door.  It's everything I wish I didn't know.  It's true.  Give me something.  I can feel.  Feel. 
[02:31:00]  Here is Reggie.  Hey, Reggie, how are you?  Hey, what's going on?  What's happening?  Can I suck your seed?  Jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib.  Elpy and Anthony suck.  Jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib.  Watch out.  What?  What the hell was that?  I knew that one.  The guy said he wanted to suck on a seed and then he said jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib,  jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib, jib.  What does that mean?  No idea.  Never heard of it in my life.  That's probably the 30th time it's called it a day. 
[02:31:30]  The guy said he wanted to suck on a seed.  What's wrong?  A puker.  A puker.  A puker.  If you're just tuning into the program, make sure you listen to the replay.  The show starts off with a bang.  There's about 12 more of those calls as we attack Shannon Burke down there in Orlando,  Florida yesterday.  Very funny though.  That was my favorite one.  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  First of all, my throat is starting to get sore.  Why don't they just sell penicillin over the counter? 
[02:32:00]  It would be very dangerous.  I think so.  People would take it for the littlest thing and people would start building up a tolerance  to it.  Well, I got to get some penicillin.  I think I'm starting to feel whatever it is in my throat.  See?  This one's brutal, dude.  Brutal.  Hawke licks the microphones when we leave just to get us all sick.  A bunch of sickies.  Mine started with a little gulp.  A bunch of sickies.  A bunch of sickies.  A little gulp and now it's an upper respiratory infection.  I got the...  Where you have to swallow real hard because it feels like there's something back there 
[02:32:30]  but it doesn't go away.  I do.  I didn't sleep all night because I was just gulping all night.  I'm on the super penicillin so I'm just waiting for it to kick in because usually that  takes care of it like that.  Isn't that the penicillin in the wheelchair with the respirator?  No?  Hey, where is kryptonite?  We got a good version of kryptonite?  What happened was I felt some intestinal cramping in the middle of Steve O's call and I realized  that I was going to probably shit in my slacks.  Ah!  So I traipsed into the restroom and cleaned off the seat and papered it and sat down and 
[02:33:00]  nothing.  Was it really working up when you were trying to clean off the seat?  Because you know your body kind of knows when you're going in there and it gets kind  of rough right at the last minute.  Yeah, it begins gurgling.  Yeah.  And I sat down and nothing would come out.  Aww.  A little plink and then finally it did.  That's because you were nervous that the show was going on and you had time constraints  so you sit down and you can't relax.  I wanted to go in and just sit down and fire out one the length of a banana and the consistency  of toothpaste.  They say that's healthy. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, God.  The type that gently sink like a well-oiled submarine.  Got a little something for you.  All around the toilet bowl, Big Monkey chased the weasel.  But weasel has the diapers on, goes the weasel.  Big Monkey takes the diapers off, wipes the weasel's bottom, puts clean diapers on and  then goes the weasel. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, there you have it.  That's disgusting.  I smell promo.  Disgusting little songs.  Who goes the weasel with us talking about crapping.  There's been enough crap discussion on this program.  Please.  Write that one down, Eric.  Write that one down.  More than enough.  Op has an idea.  I got to confess, we thought you might have went to the bathroom to whack off.  Yeah.  Because you get worked up so...  Hearing Steve-O talk?  No, no, no.  Before that, because we were talking about the vag pump, you showed us your rod and you've  been known in the past to go off and whack off because you're so worked up, right? 
[02:34:30]  I wouldn't do that in a moment.  All of a sudden you left and were like, well, he's either going to take a dump or he's going  to whack off.  Never taken the work jerk?  Very rare.  Never done the work jerk?  You've done the work jerk?  Years ago.  I have, but it's rare.  Take the work jerk.  It's one of those things where you're at work and you go into the bathroom and there's  a lot of playboys or swanks laying around or something like that.  You kind of look at it.  You start thinking like, ah, it won't take long.  Kind of relax me a bit.  Then it makes you tired for the rest of your work day. 
[02:35:00]  It does make you tired and then you just don't do any work.  Then you're like, ah, I think I'm going to go home a little early.  The work jerk.  I can't sit on the toilet like that and do it.  I have to stand.  I've done it over toilets before, but I have to stand because I have to lie down with my  toes pointed straight out.  I look like I'm in rigor.  I'm very unsexy.  My left hand tweaks my nipple and I go into this like zone, especially when I'm online.  If I'm sitting in the chair, I kind of get high almost like for an hour.  I'm just kind of like stopping myself before I finish. 
[02:35:30]  Right, right.  Then you finish and go, ah, what was all the hubbub?  Now I got to face life, my fat tits and my appendix scar, just like I remembered before  I started.  Had an hour of fun and joy and pleasure in life and now it's just back to me.  I was the man in that picture having his hogs slobbered on, but now I'm just little  Jimmy Norton, failure at large.  Jimmy Robinson for a while with the cape.  That's right.  Now you're just Jimmy Norton again.  Anthony, you just reminded me of something.  It's a quickie. 
[02:36:00]  A quick hi mom.  Which one is that?  Hi mom, I got fired from work.  I got fired from work for masturbating.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play hi mom.  I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really gullible.  Alright, relax.  What?  Jim's pointing at me.  Is that your voice?  Yeah, it is.  Oh, God.  I started radio when I was 12.  Yeah, listen to that.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, we got your mom on the phone.  Um. 
[02:36:30]  That was very hurtful, Jim.  I just didn't sound like you.  I couldn't believe that was you.  You weren't sure and you're pointing at me.  Is that your voice?  Who is that?  I'm like, yeah, that's my voice.  Hey, we're the only station that really rocks.  You're listening to Hobie and Anthony's show.  The Ethel Merman and Anthony show.  Things are swell.  You got your mom on the phone.  Well, I don't know.  I think when we used to record stuff back then, like it recorded just slightly fast. 
[02:37:00]  Is that it?  Because there's a lot of old stuff that just sound sped up a bit.  All high voice.  A little bit.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play hi, mom.  I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really gullible.  Hold on the line.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Hello?  What's the problem now?  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Good luck. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Autumn turns to winter.  And winter turns to spring.  It's not just season to know it goes for everything.  Where's Opie's part?  Is that him?  You know?  You got to take a lesson from Mother Nature and if you do, you'll know.  When it's time to change, then it's time to change. 
[02:38:00]  You got your mom on the phone, isn't it?  When I come along for the ride, don't you see?  When it's time to change, then it's time to rearrange.  When you are into what you're going to be.  Cha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Cha-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Cha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Cha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Day by day, it's hard to see the changes you've been through. 
[02:38:30]  A little bit of you, a little bit of growing, all adds up to you.  When dad tries to cut you.  A girl's a woman, too.  And if you want to reach your destiny, it's what you've got to do.  Dad has AIDS, you know.  Dad has AIDS.  Life's a time to come along for the ride.  Oh, it's time to change your last name because you're embarrassed.  You're embarrassed. 
[02:39:00]  Time to change your melanoma melanoma.  Open doors on my face.  Sitting in court with ten dollars, my lawyer.  Marches in my name.  In the dumpster.  In the dumpster.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Cha-na-na-na-na-na-na.  When it's time to change your diaper because you don't have control of your faculties. 
[02:39:30]  Cha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Make a quilt.  Cha-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Autumn turns to winter.  You'll be dead by spring.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  Easier to bury you in summer comes the ground isn't frozen.  Ooh, it's time to change.  Rach.  You're the worst at rhyming.  I wasn't supposed to rhyme.  It was time to change that coffin order for a skinnier one. 
[02:40:00]  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  God to rearrange those flowers.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  No more tulips, because that's what got him in trouble.  It's time to rearrange.  That's horrible.  Horribly funny.  Shana-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

[02:48:30]  funny  I forgot about  the ending  of that one  yeah we gotta  play that one  and then he  takes the Ben  clips and puts  them all together  yeah we gotta  play that one  from time to time  I forgot all  about that  some shitty  that's really  good  an oldie  but a goodie  yes and you  flew in from  Florida  yeah well I  came up for  my wedding  actually  oh that's  right we were  talking about  your wedding  we were trying  to talk you  out of it  right  yeah  we always do  that it's a  public service  we feel compelled  to do it  every time we  hear some sucker  being married  but you're  being married  up here  yeah  why is that  that's where  all our family  lives  whose family  mine and hers 
[02:49:00]  we were raised  up here  in upstate  well she was  living upstate  I was living  in Long Island  Long Island  but the wedding  is where  upstate  yeah that speaks  volume  they're paying  for it  so they can  have it up there  they're paying  for it  you eat it  so it's upstate  where upstate  by the way  New Windsor  New Windsor  yes  it's a good  hour and a half  would you have  rather had it  on Long Island  I would have  rather gone  to the justice  of the peace  or flew to Vegas  ah see  even the Vegas  thing is kind of  cool  yeah why not  the Vegas thing 
[02:49:30]  is turning out  to be real cool  got more legs  than it used to  you know  it's not  it's not a  guaranteed flop  wedding if you  do it in Vegas  anymore  a lot more  people are doing  it  yeah  should have done  that but no  big thing  is it a big  wedding  120  130 people  what kind of  hall you get  up there  in New Windsor  is it like  a hunting lodge  paneling and  animal heads  on the wall  it's a real  catering hall  they got a real  nice and cheesy  elevator that comes  up from the  bottom of the  floor  I don't think  we're going  to use that  oh where the  bride and groom 
[02:50:00]  can come out  of the floor  oh wow  wow  that's a good  one  rock and roll  I'd pay for  that  see that one  that's good  the applause  will start  as the elevator  starts to come  out  brand new  mr. and  missus  smoke machine  and bubbles  as the elevator  is coming up  I can only assume  you can only assume  to cover up  the mechanics  of it  there's smoke  and then all  of a sudden  the bride and  groom is there  that's good  and then a lawyer  comes up  from another  one  serves you  those divorce  papers  dressed as  the devil  another big 
[02:50:30]  freight elevator  comes up  so you can  put your  money on it  and then it  goes away  and you never  see it again  that's fascinating  good stuff  but then there's  the one elevator  that's really helpful  that one goes  to the bottom  of the ocean  another little  small elevator  for maybe  another visitor  another little  guest of the  elevator  hey some shitty  sit down  because we have  to go right  to the phone  oh we do  we have a very  very big star  on the phone  a very big star  ladies and gentlemen  in the rock  Dwayne Johnson  Dwayne 
[02:51:00]  how you guys doing  the rock  long time  no talk  how are you  buddy  great  it's good  to talk  to you guys  again  as he laughs  through that  because I know  you're probably  doing the satellite  tour today  where you're  making a lot  of phone calls  and you probably  saw our name  on the list  and went  oh these guys  again  no but  the truth  of the matter  is when  I saw the name  I was like  guys listen  I gotta go in  I actually requested  to go in live  but because of my  schedule I couldn't  oh that's very cool  we'd love to have you  in man  we will for sure  we had you on  before you 
[02:51:30]  a huge movie star  now  Jesus Christ  you know  everyone was saying  that you'd probably  take off  and look  you did it  now  how were you  involved in wrestling  really not that much  at all  yeah  contractually I was  done with them  last year  and that was it  and just moving on  I appreciate  everything that  I was able to do  and I appreciate  the relationship  I had with those guys  I heard that the  contract just kind  of ran out  huh  you know what  that's what happened 
[02:52:00]  it went down  in a way that  that was not only  disappointing  but you know  that kind of  pissed me off  but it was just  one of those things  that ran out  never got contacted  not a goodbye  not a thank you  not a good luck  not anything like that  why is that  and it's really  really weird  considering the  family history  we talked about  that the last  time I was in there  my grandfather  wrestled for Vince's  dad  I wrestled  and my dad  of course wrestled  but  was there  some animosity  maybe some animosity  because of your 
[02:52:30]  success  and they maybe  attribute  some of your  success to  the wrestling  and feel like  you're abandoning  them or something  I don't think so  I hope not  I don't think  at any point  anybody thought  I was abandoning  them  especially from  a company standpoint  because I would  always go back  in my spare time  yeah  whenever I had a  moment to go back  I would go back  to do my job  in terms of  helping the company  and always giving back  I went back  for Wrestlemania  I went back  for television 
[02:53:00]  appearances  anything I could do  just to go back  and help out  so have you spoken  to Vince recently  or no  no  wow  no not at all  I think probably  about a month and a half  two months ago  I was reading  excuse me  I was reading something  where Vince was saying  that they're going to  try to work something  out with you  I swear to god  oh really  that was him  just spinning it  a little bit  it might have been  page six  or something like that  oh ok  the reality is  somebody was saying  that I guess  they were blaming  it on the postage 
[02:53:30]  really  like the postage  wasn't there  whatever it was  postage  something insane  who knows  the weird part is  the WWE needs you  I mean the ratings  are down these days  you know  you were there  when it was just  absolutely huge  one of the superstars  of course  how do you deal  with using the name  The Rock  because I know  Vince is really  protective of  it's still a dual  ownership  like he has the  ability to use it  in terms of  say for example  we want to make  an action figure  or something like that 
[02:54:00]  how did you work  out getting  part ownership  in that though  because doesn't  usually own  it was like a couple  of years ago  we sat down  and by the way  I've always had  a great relationship  with him  and a great partnership  and we talked  about that  and he knew then  what I wanted  to do  with movies  and continue  to make that  transition  and that was  a couple  of years ago  around the time  that the rundown  came out  and we just  made that agreement  and that was it  wow that's pretty  good for you though 
[02:54:30]  because it would  have sucked  if The Rock  had to go out  under the name  Joanie  did you see  China's  sex tape  no  you didn't see it  I heard about it  we love Joanie  she's been on the  show a lot  but Anthony  and I are like  what are you doing  wow  any ounce of dignity  that she had left  was just gone  without the window  how was it  oh my god  it was really  it was unique 
[02:55:00]  let's just say  she has a body  that is very muscular  so that's a little  odd to see nude  and then her  her private area  there was something  going on there  that  it was a little  masculine looking  Dwayne it's as big  as a thumb  really hot  yeah  and one of the guys  that does the show  with us  Jim Noren  he loves that  on a woman  but  it kind of horrified  Anthony and I  oh here  Vince has a word  for you  you're fired 
[02:55:30]  you're fired  oh Jesus Christ  you don't need that  anymore anyway  you're a big movie star  you're in the remake  of Get Shorty  Be Cool  it's not a remake  it's a sequel  I'm sorry a sequel  I'm really under the weather  the remake was Walking Talk  and you play a gay character  right Dwayne  I do  and you're getting  rave reviews  in the New York Post  today  did you read that yet  no I didn't get a chance  it's pretty hilarious  they have a picture 
[02:56:00]  of you with your afro  and your  and your blue  your powder blue suit  yeah that hair  is something on you man  looks good right  looking good  and what  you play a bodyguard  or something  that's gay  yeah it's me  and Vince Vaughn  we're partners  in the movie  and I play  I play a guy  who's this  who's this badass guy  who's kicked a lot of ass  but at the same time  happens to be gay  and wants to  want to entertain the world  through song  and through dance  great  it's hilarious 
[02:56:30]  that's pretty good  you didn't have to do  any kissing scenes  or anything did you  no no  I didn't have to do  any kissing scenes  yeah that's a little rough  I've seen a few of those  on screen  it's like oh  you just  it's painful to watch  they have Frank DiCaro  in this article  talking about how hot  you are as a gay guy  because he's gay  have you gotten a lot  of letters  from gay guys  saying they were  impressed with your performance  no no no  you know what  the truth is  I think  I've gotten  well I've gotten  a lot of  positive reviews  and positive letters 
[02:57:00]  actually from the gay community  because they just  I think they just  appreciate the fact  that it wasn't  turning anything  into a mockery  or turning into  a Saturday Night Live skit  or anything like that  by trying to play it  as straight as possible  no pun intended  right  well Frank DiCaro  he says in this article  not only can we smell  what the rock is cooking  we can see what he's  staring it with  oh god damn  you're wearing some  tight pants  in some of these scenes  that's the problem  when you wear the tight  when you wear the tight pants  I think he's claiming 
[02:57:30]  that you got a huge hog  there Dwayne  a huge hog  and then he goes on  and he says  he's like nine feet  of Polynesian god  yelps DiCaro  he's delicious to look at  and that thing he can do  with the eyebrow  when he does that  there's a 14 year old  girl in me  who's seeing the Beatles  for the first time  I really want to scream  wow  so you're getting  rave reviews  from the gay guy  Frank is like  uber gay  we've had him on the show  oh that's great  really really gay  so you're not going 
[02:58:00]  to be at Wrestlemania  no  no I don't foresee  that at all  okay  I'm looking  I'm just looking  at some of the other  movies you have  coming up  Doom  yeah I got Doom  coming out  Doom  a great game  in August  yeah  and  it was great writing  we had a great writer  and rated R  unapologetic  just like the game  good  it's so funny  because  I remember last year  Ben Affleck  and I like Ben  he's actually a cool guy 
[02:58:30]  he's like listen  I never want to  blow anything up again  I don't want to  shoot any guns  or anything like that  well I love  blowing shit up  in this  in this  in Doom  it's just  it's a consistent  blowing shit up  and just  I'm sorry about  the cussing by the way  that's fine  satellite radio  satellite radio my friend  oh good  fuck it  exactly  I love hearing  the stars curse  yeah that's good  that you know  you're a guy  that gets on screen  and kicks some ass  you know  so  what  Ben Affleck  actually said  he doesn't want to 
[02:59:00]  get on and blow  stuff up anymore  yeah I guess  I don't know what  happened  what was his reasoning  I don't want to  blow anything up  I don't want to  shoot any guns  anymore  oh god  he went Hollywood  I think he's got  to go back to  drinking  yeah  drinking and guns  he's got to go back  to living in Boston  and then we got  Johnny Bravo  is that the cartoon  a little  yeah that's the cartoon  they're rewriting it  right now  it's actually really  really good  doing that  really really fun  wow man  you got like  one two three  four five films 
[02:59:30]  in pre-production  you're hot  I got a lot  I'm lucky man  I really got  good people around  I got some good  material too  which is tough  you still hang out  with any of the  wrestlers  no but  probably  keep in contact  with them  from let me see  Kurt Angle  to Chris Jericho  just those two guys  what about mankind  Mick Foley  yeah Mick Foley  yeah  he called me about  like  at the end of last year  he's a great guy  yeah we love  what did you think  of Triple H 
[03:00:00]  and Blade  I never saw it  I was over in Prague  I was filming Doom  really  yeah  look at you  in Prague  filming Doom  couldn't catch it  no movies in the hotels  over there  no no  not that one  it's not going to be  a sex tape  featuring you  yeah not that one  there was many other  different types of movies  but not that one  yeah you're a family man  you got a four year old  now right  yeah well yeah  she's three and a half  three and a half  congratulations man  wow look at that  alright Rock  well it sounds like  the movie's gonna be  a smash  you know what 
[03:00:30]  I hope so  I got a chance  to see it  really really funny  and  well I loved  Get Shorty  that's one of my favorites  so  when's it come out  yeah so it's  basically obviously  the same character  with Travolta  but  a cast of other  characters around  and really really  make it good  cool man  we'll go see it  when does the movie  come out  the movie comes out  tomorrow  oh yeah  well next time you're  in New York  come on by and say hi  we're having a lot of fun  with this satellite radio  I would love to  congratulations by the way  I was reading about you guys  it's awesome  and next time I come in 
[03:01:00]  we'll have  we'll do a great interview  yes  what are you laughing  we're over all that crap  no god damn troublemaker  sitting in on the  I was greatly misinformed  last time  yeah  no we were too  you know  whatever  it was a misunderstanding  but we're past all that  it's all good  it's all good  we'd love to have you in here Rock  I would absolutely love to  and I will definitely next time  I appreciate everything  alright thank you Dwayne  alright boy  there he goes  go see Be Cool  starting tomorrow  Dwayne The Rock Johnson  we should explain  for the new audience 
[03:01:30]  we had a very uncomfortable  moment with The Rock  very uncomfortable  we really thought  we were going to get  beat up  get the crap kicked out of us  because we had a great  relationship with the  WWF  WWE  and The Rock came in  and we had a killer  interview man  I mean he was our  favorite character  or whatever wrestler  back then  and we were just  really  really  he had a lot of heat  back then  yeah the chemistry  the chemistry was just  great  we were having so much fun  and we invited this guy  that did a wrestling  website  Sick Boy  and all of a sudden 
[03:02:00]  you know  Sick Boy did a lot  for the show  so we're like  hey Sick Boy  you want to ask  The Rock a question  and all of a sudden  The Rock  his whole mood  changes  in a second  he goes  your Sick Boy  from that website  he went  you motherfucker  and I guess it turns out  that Sick Boy  on this website  and we honest to god  had no idea  had a lot of  racist stuff  on the website  a lot of racist stuff  about The Rock  was on this website  oh wow  and yeah  The Rock found out  about it  knew about it 
[03:02:30]  knew who this guy was  knew the website  knew the stuff  that was written  on the website  and thought  that this guy  was part of our show  he just came in  Sick Boy  because he was a fan  of wrestling  and wanted to sit in  and you know us  we're like  yeah come on down  yeah listeners  are hanging out  all the time  yeah  so he came down  and Rock thought  he was part of our show  and we were in cahoots  with that  and the website  and just  all of a sudden  it just turned  it was really bad  he goes  if you guys  are associated  with Sick Boy  this interview's over  or something like that  nothing to do with it  I don't want anything 
[03:03:00]  to do with you guys  and pretty much  walked out  it was done  the interview was done  we were trying to explain  but there was no  explaining at that point  over the years  it got settled  and he realized  people had told him  no  that he's not part of the show  and everything's cool  that's why he was laughing  when he said  I'd love to come in  yeah let me come in  so you have  sitting there  we'll invite David Duke  in to sit down  and interview him  why would Sick Boy  show up  if you knew you wrote  Racist  why would you show up 
[03:03:30]  and confront a  six foot five guy  you wrote Racist  here's the deal  with Sick Boy  he ran a website  he wasn't writing  the racist stuff  but he wasn't  taking it off  of his website  it was a message board  or something  and he had no idea  that The Rock  was reading his website  right and Sick Boy  was a huge wrestling fan  yeah  it wasn't like  he was coming in  to confront The Rock  at all  it was just a major  misunderstanding  and Eric just found  the clip  yeah just go to  foundrymusic.com  in the search  just type in The Rock  oh just type in The Rock 
[03:04:00]  and it'll pop right up  right  yeah  if you go to  foundrymusic.com  if you want to  listen to some  some O&A history  there you go  it's very uncomfortable  The Rock says  you're a racist  alright why don't we  take a quick break  oh that would  a lot of people  saying it would be  interesting to see  Poe versus The Rock  in the security room  with all that The Rock  would have to go through  right  and then Poe  and The Rock  who would you take  fight  Poe and The Rock  I have to  you know  I definitely respect  Poe's skills  but I have to go  with The Rock  The Rock is so big 
[03:04:30]  he grabs you  but then again  guys who can  really grapple  and I mean guys  who really can  fight like that  the bigger you are  they don't care  how big you are  because they  arm lock you  and they do things  that will just  snap bones quickly  that's true  I've seen like  the Gracie family  on the  140 pound guys  yeah little guys  that take out  big guys  but I don't know  yeah if he gets  I think if The Rock  gets you though  yeah The Rock's an athlete  he's not just a big dope  I mean he's a guy  who fights and throws  people for a living  so he also has skills  I don't know  we should ask Poe about that  I'll go in there  and ask him  when The Rock comes in 
[03:05:00]  we'll just say  it's getting hot in here  and then we'll say  oh The Rock is trying  to assault us  and Poe  Poe turn down  his monitor in there  I'm like fucking  with 6 foot 5 Rock  let it be hot stupid  open the window  he turns on the AC unit  for the studio  I'm sorry  it's hot in there boys  I wanted a picture  with Dwayne  before he ripped  your heads off  and Funky Treasure  from CringeHumor.net  is saying  great relationship  with the WWF  what about the time  Stevie had to choke  the life out of Opie  yeah that was a bad scene 
[03:05:30]  too  because I got cocky  what happened  you did  you can't talk smack  to these guys  or else they will  he cracked something  in my throat  dead serious  like my voice box  or something  it was the most  uncomfortable feeling  I've ever had in my life  and it took two weeks  to go away  why would you allow him  to put his arm around your neck  we were at the River Rave  in Boston  you know  kind of backstage  hanging out  and he was there  and we were filming  something for the website  or something  I don't even remember  maybe I think 
[03:06:00]  it was for TV  yeah it was for  some wrestling thing  some piece they were doing  oh yeah  it was going to be part  of one of the wrestling shows  and I got real cocky  and you know  like I could get  and he called me out  on it  and he goes  oh yeah  and he threw me  in a choke hold  and lifted me  right off the ground  by my voice box  that happened years ago  with  what's his name  the comic  did Cavett  no  no  Dr. David Schultz  did some  oh  Richard Belzer  oh yeah Belzer  Richard Belzer  had a talk show 
[03:06:30]  and he had the Hulk on  and Mr. T  and um  uh  the Bells  just kept saying  how wrestling is fake  and isn't it fake  and wanted these guys  to fess up  that it's fake  and uh  the Hulk got up  and said  I'll show you  how fake this is  and put the sleeper  hold on him  and choked the Bells out  and just  you know  you're watching TV  you watch the Bells  just collapse  on the stage  uh  he let him out  of the sleeper  hold  the Bells  like pretty much  came right back  to life  he was all woozy  looked in the camera  and said  we'll be right back  after these 
[03:07:00]  and it uh  went on for years  lawsuits and everything  and Belzer actually  got a settlement  from both of them  yeah  well today's wrestling  is not like your  father's wrestling  I mean  you know  you want to claim  it's fake  and all that  which you know  it pretty much  is  they present it  as sports entertainment  yeah  but they beat  the crap out of each other  we know these guys  well enough  that they're getting  um  you know  bruised  pretty  you know  they're getting messed up  pretty good in the ring  when they're flying  off of ladders  oh here's Opie being choked  right  wow  holy jesus  yeah  your head is like  a bobblehead doll 
[03:07:30]  yeah no  I never saw that  and look at my pal  Anthony climbing on his back  I climbed up on his back  trying to get him off of Opie  but it wasn't happening  look at this choke  he puts on  dude that's  that's the real deal  and he shakes your head  look at Opie's head shake  look at this big goon  choking you  dude that was the real deal  that's  and Anthony at this point  thinks it's kind of  you know whatever  I was just trying to  distract him  yeah  play it again  I'm like a fly  where's this on  foundrymusic.com  I'm like a fly  what do you have to do

[03:11:00]  wake up  are you  alive  are you  listening to me  I'm gonna talk  about some  antigies  now  someone  is  gonna die  when you  listen to  me  this is  a big die  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM.  The virus is spreading.  Oh, it's spreading.  Is Howard listening to our show at this point?  I know he has XM. 
[03:11:30]  It's like two weeks behind us on a lot of stuff.  It's getting a little strange.  Yeah.  A little strange, Anthony.  A little strange.  Stop, Jimmy.  I want a Pop-Tart.  Stop.  Do you really want one?  Anthony, look at him.  I want a Pop-Tart.  I just want a...  Stop with the banana.  I'm hungry.  Pop-Tart.  Would you share one of those with me?  Yeah.  And they're two in a pack?  Yeah, you take the first one. 
[03:12:00]  Why don't we all have Pop-Tarts?  Oh, God.  He's deep-throating them.  Yeah, where's the banana?  Is Travis around to cook up some Pop-Tarts for us?  There you go, Jimmy.  Here, cook up some Pop-Tarts.  Slim, you want one?  That's right.  All righty.  I don't need them cooked.  No, you got to cook them up.  No, you don't.  Eat it raw.  Travis, could you cook these?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Don't burn them.  I won't.  You know what happens.  Can I have some more water?  Yeah, I can do some more water, too.  More for the boss, quickly.  Also known as Agua. 
[03:12:30]  All right, so we have Slim Shitty in the studio.  Getting married, blah, blah, blah.  No one cares about that.  In 1984, John Stossel told wrestler Dr. D he thought wrestling was fake.  I guess Dr. D attacked Stossel yelling,  You think it's fake?  And, yeah, choked him out.  Stossel sued and won $425,000.  Damn it, I could have made a lot of money.  You got to see this video.  Dr. D was fired by the WWF.  You probably could have.  I probably could have sued. 
[03:13:00]  Your head, it gets rocked.  Like, as he's choking you, you're getting whiplash because he's moving his big, meaty hand.  And we have a video of it.  That would hold up in court big time.  Well, not anymore.  Dude, you know what?  I had to take my beating because I went after him verbally, and so there you go.  If I could make some cash, believe me, I'd poke the rock in the chest.  I'd take a good smash to the jaw.  Would you?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Would you?  Wake up three weeks later, I'm a millionaire.  All right, so what's the deal with the new song, Slim Shitty? 
[03:13:30]  You know, 100% honest is that I just wanted an excuse to come up here and see you guys again.  Oh!  It is a treat to sit in with us, isn't it?  I thought it was a treat to sit in with me.  Watchers eat.  I know.  Watch Jimmy deep-throat a fucking banana like a...  Look at him.  I don't know what a log looks like.  What do you want to do?  I'm going to spit out Pop-Tot, you ass.  Get my checkbook.  That's how it looks, Jesus.  I'm standing out of your mouth.  Hanging out of his mouth.  No, no.  I'm on my back. 
[03:14:00]  I don't want to swallow it.  Do you really do that?  No.  Of course not.  No, Mom and Dad.  You know, what's funny is every day we have listeners that kind of check out the show.  We have like, I guess that would be the studio audience out there.  Courtside.  Yeah, the seats are empty today, but on a regular basis there are people that just sit and watch  us do our show even though they see our lips moving and then there's a delay so it doesn't  sync up really.  Yeah.  But they check out the show.  And I notice a lot of them walk away going, oh, that's it? 
[03:14:30]  That's it?  It's better to hear through your speakers, I think, at home.  They expect a three-ring circus to get a fucking buffet.  Us eating.  Us eating, him complaining, he's not feeling well.  Ant not moving for four hours.  Me pissing every three seconds and shitting.  I got cancer.  There's some weird stuff that goes on during this show.  Anthony literally does not get up from his seat for four hours.  I troll the internet during that break. 
[03:15:00]  Every opportunity, during the break, it's 30-second breaks.  And I'm trolling.  Every chance I get, I jump up and do something.  Yeah.  Walk out of the studio, take leaks, whatever.  Usually it's Jimmy and I taking leaks, talking about how the show's going.  And when you look through the office, you see Ben and you look like you're looking under  his head under a magnifying glass and then you realize, no, that's just how large it  is.  Well, that's true.  You do not get up.  No, I sit here and I read.  All right.  I have, I have, how many, one, two, three, four, five, five browsers up today. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  And I go through them.  All right.  You got the story about the doc busted in the, uh...  Yeah, there's all kinds of things.  I'll just pop up.  I'll go to the movie sites and, you know, look at what The Rock is up to.  Yeah.  Before we do The Rock interview.  So I'm constantly doing research.  All right.  Why don't we play Slim Shitty's latest creation?  Mm-hmm.  He's getting married.  So what the hell?  I think it...  Bachelor party set up, dude.  Tonight.  Tonight is your bachelor party.  Doing a little Italian restaurant thing with a limo and then we're going to Cafe Royale. 
[03:16:00]  Cafe Royale.  Farmingdale.  A little VIP treatment.  That's, uh...  That place isn't topless, is it?  I'm pretty sure it is.  It is?  Yeah.  I remember I went there once and they were dressed in, like, bathing suits.  Unless something's changed in the last two years.  It was one of my favorite places.  That's cool.  You go there.  Nice.  Get your friend, uh...  Hook anything up?  Is there going to be any whores?  Uh...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Have fun.  Yeah.  The bachelor party.  Sounds great. 
[03:16:30]  How many guys?  Uh, ten, including myself.  Ten guys.  Wow.  Ten guys all just...  Wild and crazy men.  Getting horny.  Those look a little dark on top.  No, they look a little light on top, actually.  I saw a little...  Oh, those are the holes that the filling is coming out of.  They look too much like Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  I want them to look like Halle Berry.  Halle Berry?  Ah, that's a good way to put it.  Thank you, Travis.  Thank you so much.  All right, so here's Slim Shitty.  I hear it's a song about Chester.  Yeah, I already hit up Jim with the Monster Rain and then Ben and Anthony. 
[03:17:00]  I could have, I guess, with the Beverly Hills stuff, but I didn't have enough time and Chester  was pretty much out there.  All right.  Chester.  This Chester thing is taking on a life of its own.  Unlike Chester.  I've never told the story.  Or Don's dog.  But people have kind of pieced it together, I guess.  Uh-huh.  With the little hints I've given.  Oh, yeah.  You had to be a regular Columbo.  Jesus.  Dinner on the floor, foot and liver.  Wait a minute.  Dead dog.  You know when you come home from work with some food on the mind  and then some fucking mutt has to go and steal it? 
[03:17:30]  Well, there's only one thing to do.  What's that, O?  Who kicked you?  Knocked a little sliver from a sliver, but he still grabbed the beef,  that fucking mutt beef.  It's on, Chester.  Fuck all those little doggy treats.  Listen for my feet as it's ringing for your teeth.  Your yelping won't help.  I can hear your heartbeat chasing you, making your dog beat.  The hammer's about to drop as a hero knock knocks.  Chester, come downstairs and kiss your mom.  Gonna get it now.  No time to think. 
[03:18:00]  Gotta find a box of water, make this bitch a drink.  The bitch already drunk, no need to postpone.  Three rice make a left.  I want to go home.  Sneak a peek at Chester while he's chewing on the bone.  Picturing what I'ma write on his tombstone.  Here we go.  He stole my dinner.  Kicked in the liver.  Should've done it like Scott Peterson and tossed him in the river.  In the river.  Fuck the liveries.  I meant what I did.  If Lil Chester fucked the dog, I want to kill his kids.  Now a daydream.  The cock schemes.  Kicking Bob Kelly's dogs wouldn't make me fucking cream.  Everyone around me thinks I'm fine, 
[03:18:30]  but I'm wishing I could plant my boot in a dog spawn.  And I, and I, I still persist.  Bob Kelly's dogs is the next on my list.  Can I kick your dog?  Not hard, I just want to tap it.  Just annoy it a little bit.  How about I just flick his belly with my finger, just like.  Why would you want to kick my dog?  My dog, it weighs nine pounds.  I know.  There's no way you have that much control in your foot.  Just a tiny little.  To kick it a little tiny bit.  I just want to poke it.  You're not going to kick my dog, you ass.  Just a little.  What's wrong with you?  Just a little bit.  You're sadistic. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, that's not bad, man.  Very good.  Slim shitty, everybody.  That's aight.  That's aight.  Very funny.  I like that.  I like the mother-in-law character that you put in there.  Very funny.  Three rights make a left.  I want to go home.  Oh, Pop-Tarts are back.  Oh, how are they now?  Well, I don't know how they're getting there. 
[03:19:30]  Sort of a Sinbad.  You're pushing your luck if you go any more in there.  You think?  Yeah.  They're going to come out burned, believe me.  Oh, forget it.  They look like that dude that plays basketball.  He has a little black blood in him.  He has like the black afro, but the rest of his body is like white.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, yeah.  Are they good hot?  Yeah.  I think I'm going to enjoy these.  Thank you.  You've got to watch, though, because it could go... 
[03:20:00]  You want one?  Take a piece of one.  I already had one.  Here.  In a matter of seconds, it could go from Halle Berry to Lou Gossett, Jr.  That's it.  Mickey Rivers.  Mickey Rivers.  That's my favorite of all time.  Is that filling hot?  Mm-hmm.  Ooh.  All right.  Weird.  Careful.  Careful now.  Don't want to burn yourself up.  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  Okay.  You don't have to smack when you eat.  Google, man. 
[03:20:30]  Where are your poker chips today?  Hey, why didn't Tommy Lee do our show today?  Oh, no.  Look at their on Regis.  These sellouts.  Tommy Lee does Regis, but he won't do this show?  I like your tattoos.  Yeah, because we pissed him off.  Got to throw in a little aside about Motley Crue yesterday, I guess, ringing the stock exchange bell.  Apparently, I was on the train this morning, I heard two guys probably working on Wall Street  saying that Mick couldn't make it up to the bell because he's got a bad hip.  Yeah, his bones are like graham crackers. 
[03:21:00]  So he couldn't make it up the stairs to go ring the bell.  No, he's in really bad shape.  Really bad.  They don't even know how they're going to do the whole tour with this guy.  He's hunched over all the time.  He can't straighten up.  It's actually really, really sad.  But Tommy Lee, look at you.  I think his hair's getting really dark, man.  Now tell me, so you got the herpes, the hepatitis, what disease did that whore give you?  Give him a real interview.  Oh, he's doing the rock, the rock fingers, the pointer and the pinky finger. 
[03:21:30]  You're on Regis.  Please tell me we're taping this.  We have to.  I absolutely want to hear this.  Please tell me we're taping this.  Can't we just turn the volume up and play it?  No, we're not.  I don't know why, but we can't do it.  What if it's in the background?  I mean, Regis talking to Motley Crue, you know he has no idea who they are.  The Motley Crue.  He probably just calls them The Crue.  The Motley Crue.  So what is that?  How long have you guys been together?  First Larry King and then Regis.  Boy, they're really fucking hitting all the hard rock circuits.  Yeah.  Really rocking. 
[03:22:00]  Vince and Mick couldn't be here because they're doing The View.  What the fuck happened to this band?  Oh, that's awful.  Did I tell you I have an album out?  Forget me not, you sightless twat.  Forget me not.  Punch that twat.  I remember one time I woke up with a heroin needle stuck out of my arm.  I was snorting ants with Ozzy.  I was a rocker back then. 
[03:22:30]  So, Tommy, how big is that hog?  I hear it's giant.  Go ahead.  Take a look at his hog.  What's her name, the whore that he's with there now?  I don't know.  Kelly?  Kelly Ripper.  His hair looks good, Nicky.  Kelly Ripper.  Why don't you rip a hotwad with that huge monster?  All right.  You make me feel so young.  Tommy Lee's so hung. 
[03:23:00]  That's great.  Oh, you know this just stinks, this interview.  I can't wait to play it.  Hopefully tomorrow.  No?  Or later today?  Maybe we can get it on before we get out of here?  That'd be great.  Even just a piece.  We just need a piece.  Just a piece, Hawk.  Tom, what's up?  Yo.  Tom from Long Island.  Yeah, what's up?  I have a tattoo on my penis.  It says, okay.  And then when I get excited, it says, Oklahoma!  Go ahead, fast, Tom.  Hey, that bar in Long Island's closed. 
[03:23:30]  That top-less bar he's talking about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Don't go there no more.  Oh, they put clothes on?  No, it's done.  They're closed.  Oh, closed?  Wait a minute.  Constitution.  You got a bachelor party going?  You're supposed to go to a place and you don't even know if it's open?  I requested the place.  I wasn't the one planning the party.  Closed for prostitution.  Let me tell you what you do.  Here's what you do.  Closed for prostitution.  Over and out, guys.  You know where, obviously, the Long Island Expressway is?  Yes, I do.  Well, instead of going to the Cafe Royale, you keep going down the Expressway a little ways. 
[03:24:00]  You get off at exit, I believe it's 51 Deer Park Avenue.  Okay.  And you take that to Jericho Turnpike.  You just take it north on Deer Park Avenue.  Once you get on Jericho Turnpike, you just go a matter of yards.  And look on your right.  You will see a place called The Tender Trap.  Oh, I've been to the Tender Trap.  I wrote a song about The Tender Trap.  The Tender Trap, my friend.  You want Long Island sleazery, this is your place. 
[03:24:30]  Really?  The Tender Trap.  Hard women with other ghouls.  They're great in there.  Go to The Tender Trap.  You'll love it.  All right, Ant.  Skank whores.  All the chicks have snatches, like, snuffle off against trunks.  Oh, they're awful.  I love that.  Oh.  You got to, when you sit at the bar, you got to go, and blow away.  You just see pubic hairs flying off of the bar.  Oh, right into the ice.  It's great.  I love it.  All right, here you go, Ant.  I like this story a lot.  It was in the Daily News today. 
[03:25:00]  Doc busted in patient sex rap.  Pretty much every day, there's one of these in the paper.  Guys that just can't control themselves.  A Manhattan plastic surgeon has been busted for molesting a patient who asked him to remove  a scar from her lip.  So this lady goes in, she's got a scar on her lip, the plastic surgeon's looking at the  scar, right?  Okay.  The woman told cops Smith was examining her lip when he suddenly lifted her sweater  and began fondling her breasts.  Wow. 
[03:25:30]  Wow.  What's his name?  Dr. Smith.  You will be molested.  Oh, you know, I didn't even make that.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Yes, come to Dr. Smith.  I'll feel your boobies.  I can't take it anymore.  She must have had a really nice set.  Yeah.  Because it wasn't even like a gynecologist or, you know what I mean?  Dentist, she's out under anesthesia and you sneak a little feel.  This guy's just talking about a lip.  There's no way you could make a mistake. 
[03:26:00]  There's no connection between the lip and her boobs in any way, but the guy just lost his  mind.  Miss, I do see this scar.  We could take care of this with some minor...  I've got to feel those tits.  He just lost his mind right there.  I've got to touch those.  He just starts tuning in Tokyo.  Yeah.  Paul.  Those are great tits to make you toss out eight years of medical school.  That's it.  You've got to feel them.  They must have been a great set.  He's probably in his head like, I've got to fix her lip.  How can I touch her tits, though, and explain to her that it's because of the lip? 
[03:26:30]  You know, there's a nerve connection between the lip and the breast area.  I must check this out.  Bye.  Please look at that lip.  Come here closer.  Closer, my dear.  Yes.  Well, that looks like a simple operation.  That could be fixed with...  Oh, I must grab your titties! 
[03:27:00]  Tweet those nipples!  Your bosoms are as smooth as young William's bottom.  Yes, but William's bottom doesn't have those pesky nipples in the way.  They're just such a turn-off.  Just hold your bosoms together, cover your nipples, and speak like a young boy.  Yes, like Opie did at AAF.  Talk like that.  All right.  So, yeah, a Manhattan plastic surgeon has been busted for molesting a patient who asked  him to remove a scar from her lip. 
[03:27:30]  Medical school, medical school.  This actually gets better.  The woman told cops Smith was examining her, her lip, when he suddenly lifted her sweater  and began finaling her breast.  The woman also claims Smith tried to remove her pants and thrust his body against hers.  I was protecting her!  There was a creature coming toward the Jupiter, too! 
[03:28:00]  Wow!  My gyration scared him away!  What a whore dog!  That guy just couldn't take it.  He just lost his mind.  He couldn't...  Little Jimmy doesn't do that.  No, especially not with pants.  A skirt, you can just lift up and jump on, but how do you unbutton and unzip pants?  What is holding her pants down?  He's looking at the lip.  All of a sudden, he just pulls her sweater up, starts fondling her boobs, and then tries  to rip her pants down.  This is a doctor.  And me and a friend held a rock over her head.  Made her give us oral favors. 
[03:28:30]  Woo!  Woo!  All right, and then it continues.  But in a secretly taped phone call after the incident, Smith told the woman he had a good  excuse for the surprise exam.  I gave her a choice.  Sit on the sticker bushes or let me touch your boobies!  She opted for the sticker bushes!  Woo!  His excuse?  He wanted to see if she had enough sensation for him to give her a tummy tuck if she wished  it.  Oh!  That makes sense.  You might have to give her a tummy tuck, so rip her pants off and start humping her 
[03:29:00]  like a monkey.  What an animal.  That's great.  That is just some guy who couldn't take it anymore.  You know, you've got to sympathize with the guy.  Sometimes you just look and go, I've got to touch that.  I've got to touch that.  And I don't know what steps in that keeps you from doing it, but somehow it didn't step  in for him.  This story made me laugh all morning.  Because, I mean, the guy just lost his mind.  Yeah.  All right, the interview's over.  If we can get that tape really fast. 
[03:29:30]  Let's get that tape for a please.  I've got to see what Regis asked Motley to do.  That's wonderful.  I'd like to thank Mr. Six for coming on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And they did do the rocker point at the end.  They did.  You know what that horrified audience must have been doing?  The old bags that go to see Regis?  Looking at those freaks?  Those aging rockers?  The faded arms full of tats?  Oof.  Tommy Lee is still a pussy, I've got to tell you.  He'd rather do Regis than a national radio show that has an audience that may go out 
[03:30:00]  and see Motley Crue.  Who the hell is going to see Motley Crue that watches Regis?  No one.  Nobody.  Larry King to interview you?  Larry King.  Interview you?  Why?  And now, the Motley Crue.  That awful interview.  And we did try to get them, by the way.  I know.  And Vince Neil loves us.  He does?  Yeah.  Vince Neil, he created the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  That's true.  Because it was something they used to do on the road. 
[03:30:30]  I heard you had taken credit for that, and he actually called Steppin' Out Magistrate  and said, no, I invented the Wiffle Bat Challenge.  What a douche.  Yeah, you got something on me.  Whatever, dude.  Forget me nuts.  At least we didn't try to ever get Howard's attention by putting on a dress, you idiot.  We made something out of ourselves without Howard's attention. 
[03:31:00]  Another story, Anthony.  I think this is a sucks-to-be-you story.  Yeah?  We have one of those?  Finally?  We haven't done a sucks-to-be-you.  There's unlucky lottery and sucks-to-be-you.  Which we think is...  No, I guess it's not really the same thing, but it gets kind of confusing at times.  It is very confusing.  I consider the unlucky lottery something that the odds of it happening are one in a billion trillion gazillion.  And instead of winning the lottery, which are the same odds, this happens to you.  A prime example is you're driving down the New York Thruway, 
[03:31:30]  and a boulder that probably had been perched on a hillside looking at dinosaurs decides when you're passing to roll down and crush your car and kill you.  That is unlucky lottery.  It also sucks to be you if you're in that situation.  Right.  But it doesn't necessarily mean that every sucks-to-be-you is also an unlucky lottery.  The sucks-to-be-you is something that happens that just sucks to be you.  That guy that walked into the pizza place and got in a fight with the sister, 
[03:32:00]  and that big fat guy comes over and punches him as hard as he can in the face, that sucks to be you.  Is it unlucky lottery?  No.  It could probably happen 20 times in that same pizza place.  Yeah, the odds of a black guy acting violent, that's, you know, two to one.  Not exactly the lottery odds.  Oh, my goodness.  Jesus.  So that's the distinction.  This, I believe, is a sucks-to-be-you because, really, the odds of it happening, though not very low, aren't all that high.  All right.  It's an old bag.  Our skin is probably like silly putty anyway. 
[03:32:30]  92-year-old woman impaled on faucet and saved.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Lee Majors was impaled on a faucet.  Ha, ha.  Far off.  Well, you know, he's fucking...  What are you going to...  Eggnog came out of his junk.  Wow, wow.  This is pretty whacked, man.  For more than six hours yesterday, a 92-year-old Harlem woman banged on the walls 
[03:33:00]  and desperately screamed for help after she was impaled on a bathtub faucet.  Did she have a life call?  I owe my life to it.  How are you impaled on a...  Commercial.  How are you impaled on a bathtub faucet?  I don't know.  It was one of those...  As I could see, it's one of those oldie-time faucets where you turn it and there's like four  kind of prongs on there.  And one of them is facing up, and she fell, and her back hit it, and it kind of hung her 
[03:33:30]  up like on a meat hook.  I was thinking hiney hole.  Wow.  I was thinking hiney hole.  I don't know if I look more for her or the poor faucet to be stuck into a 92-year-old  asshole.  Wow.  I didn't even think of that.  Might have brought back some nice memories for her.  Oh.  Jesus.  She remembers like, ah, when the doughboys left for Europe. 
[03:34:00]  Well, we don't prep for the show, so let's read on and see where it was impaled.  All right.  Between noon and about 6 p.m., residents ignored the noise.  You got an old bag yelling and screaming and banging, and your neighbors are ignoring  you.  That old senile woman, she yells that every day.  They ignored the noise, thinking someone was working on the plumbing at that address here,  blah, blah, blah.  Two neighbors finally used a key to get into the 8th floor apartment and found Thelma Riley  naked.  Thelma.  With a four-pronged, very good, Anthony, metal faucet knob stuck in her lower back. 
[03:34:30]  Lower back.  Hmm.  Could have been right at the tailbone or something.  Oh, Jesus.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Old broad trying to take a bath by herself at 92.  Stop it.  Exactly.  They're always falling over.  Ow.  Yeah, throw that in there.  So, um.  Old pretzel bones.  Yeah.  You don't need to take a bath.  Just rinse your twat out with the water out of a sarkist can. 
[03:35:00]  A sarkist.  Sarkist?  What the?  Are you being starcastic?  As soon as I said it, I realized I haven't had tuna fish in years.  I don't remember this name.  What is that?  Oh.  Yes, I prefer clicking of a C.  Oh.  Well, that's track four, though.  Yeah, that's what you want.  What is that?  I want the whole thing.  Oh.  The whole thing.  We don't have the whole thing?  This is the whole Larry King thing, yeah.  The whole what?  Larry King.  No, I don't want the Larry King. 
[03:35:30]  No, Opie wants...  I just showed it to you.  You said, okay.  Opie wants Motley Crue on Regis.  On Regis.  Oh, you're still working on that.  Opie wants that.  Oh, yeah.  Motley Crue.  All right.  No worries.  So, she was lucky.  It's a good thing she didn't bleed out, the fire guy said.  Bleed out.  Mm-hmm.  She slipped and fell while taking a shower.  Yeah.  How many hours was she sitting there?  Six.  Six hours with a faucet knob in your back.  92.  Just stand up. 
[03:36:00]  Just stand up.  They have no energy, the old folks.  Lazy old bitch.  Lazy?  Rather just sit there and hang like the guy in Goodfellas.  Who was the one who found the meat truck?  The one who wanted the car to warm up?  Yeah.  Carboni or something?  Yeah.  Put the coffee.  Put the coffee back, that guy.  Yeah.  All frozen.  Hanging there all frozen.  There she is for six hours, impaled on a faucet knob.  Firefighters covered Riley in a sheet and placed her on a gurney in the hallway.  She was taken to Harlem Hospital with the knob still in her back. 
[03:36:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, you mean they had to take the knob?  Yeah, they had to take.  Disconnect the knob?  Yeah, they had to take bolt cutters or whatever and remove the knob.  And then it was still in her back.  She's naked.  And they had to bring her to the hospital that way.  That is truly, truly a shining moment.  And I mean, but the movie's shining.  You missed the part where the fireman couldn't take it, and he just grabbed her tits, and  since her pants were already off, he just hummed her.  Jesus. 
[03:37:00]  You're going to be okay.  You're going to be okay.  We're going to get a thing in here to pull this knob off the, I gotta feel those tits!  That's exactly what went through that doctor's mind, though.  We've lost this mind.  Imagine it's just like, it's just another day at the office, and all of a sudden he's  just, I gotta feel those tits!  He's probably sitting there going through appointment after appointment, looking in the  book going, anybody wants a tit job today so I can just feel up a girl? 
[03:37:30]  Anyone?  No.  What do we got?  Foot?  Got a problem with the foot?  I got a facelift.  I got a, what, a scar on a lip?  And all day he's waiting for the tits to come in, and they just don't.  Right.  Last appointment of the day, it's her lip.  He's looking, going, I gotta feel tits today.  Up goes the shirt.  God, I feel, isn't he trying to pull her pants down and humper?  Figured he was screwed at that point anyway.  You know, he's losing his license, his career's over.  Good point, Anthony.  Why not go for the gusto?  If he's married, his marriage is over. 
[03:38:00]  Why not, right?  Why not?  Okay, um, we got a new production piece.  Oh.  Maybe.  Yeah?  If it queues up a little bit here for us.  No, it ain't queuing up there, Eric.  I don't know.  What is it?  I don't know.  Why isn't it queuing up for open?  What happened?  I thought we replaced the CD player.  You're kidding.  I was just taking a bath. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, no.  All right, here we go.  Brand new production, Anthony.  The faucet's in my ass.  How did it happen?  Oh, give my condolences to the firemen.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's cute.  That's still one of my favorites.  All right.  This is a new production piece by Martini Steve and our own Nathaniel.  Stop it. 
[03:39:00]  Nathaniel?  Hmm.  Yeah, he's the tall intern.  Oh, that guy?  There he is.  I thought the other guy was Nathaniel.  No, that's Danny, I think.  Oh.  Danny.  All right.  Danny, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Or Derek.  I'll get him.  No, Danny.  Where's Derek?  There's Derek.  Okay.  That's his name?  Yep.  Yeah.  Derek?  Yeah.  It's Nathaniel, Donald, and Derek are the three interns.  Is he a new guy?  Why don't they introduce us?  Yeah, they've been working here, I think, a couple weeks.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  All right.  I'll get to know him after a while.  A couple weeks, five months, I'm not really sure.  All right.  The National Board of Health and Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping and just lay over one of them.  They won't help.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay.  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight decibel shits. 
[03:40:00]  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck?  Like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the face.  Hey, that's good.  That is very funny.  Remember, I'm the what? 
[03:40:30]  The last line.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  I don't know.  Okay.  On the face?  On the face.  Remember, on the face.  Remember, on the face.  Right.  My God, that's funny.  Good job, Steve.  You say some really silly stuff, Jimmy.  Yeah, but when you take it out of context like that.  Yeah.  If I had AIDS, I would bite somebody under the certain conditions that could be.  I'm sure when you said that, it was in a context that was fine.  That's right.  I was quoting Robert Reed, ironically enough.  Watch what you wish for.  LOL.  Give me those ribs, feller.  You don't need to. 
[03:41:00]  They're very apparent.  Through your suit jackets.  I love when they play the Brady Bunch themes in the final few episodes on a xylophone of his ribs.  Just kind of...  Yeah.  Keep them on the show.  All right.  I think we're pretty much done for today.  Is it that time?  Oh, my goodness.  Look at the time.  If you're getting ready for the replay because you missed the show today, we start the show off with a bang.  Usually it's Ant and I just chit-chatting.  A little small talk as we warm up, but today we got right into it. 
[03:41:30]  Something we're going to do from time to time, by the way.  Just to mix it up a little bit, Ant.  Straight out of the gate.  Straight out of the gate.  But we have a really, really good show.  Took off running.  If you're standing by, stay right where you are.  All right?  Don't check out the 90s channel yet or anything like that.  Same shit you heard two weeks ago.  Oh, they do a good job.  So what?  So what?  Buy the CD.  Oh, fuck.  Hey, this is that Christina Aguilaria.  Blah.  Yuck.  Shit. 
[03:42:00]  All of it.  It's not, though.  That's the beauty of satellite radio.  I'm not saying.  That's on Robert Reed's ribs.  That was actually him coughing.  That's great.  Do we have any, what did we learn?  All of these are good?  Ooh.  Usually, like, highlight it.  Highlight the good ones for us.  Oh, look at you.  Opie and Anthony University.  What's that? 
[03:42:30]  Motley on Regis.  Oh, man.  How much time do we have?  Oh, come on.  How much time?  Pop it in.  Pop it in.  Do we want to rush it, though?  All right, pop it in.  Screw what?  I've got to hear it.  We'll play it again tomorrow and talk about it.  I've just got to hear some of this.  This will be a tease for tomorrow's show.  We have a huge show tomorrow, by the way.  The girls coming in to do the Vag Pump.  Otto and George.  Otto and George, possibly.  Otto and George.  A couple other things I forgot already, but.  Pop Road Concert.  All right, we're back.  Yeah, those infamous bad boys of rock whose albums are sold more than 40 million world. 
[03:43:00]  Holy crap, you got his voice down.  And he's certainly more nasal than ever.  I haven't heard him in a long time.  I have a bit of a cold.  We're back together again for the first time in six years.  And they're tearing up arenas on their Better Alive Than Dead tour.  And here's the Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  I knew it. 
[03:43:30]  The Motley Crue.  Tommy, how are you doing?  How are you?  Come on, Nicky.  How are you doing?  Hello, Nicky.  How are you doing?  Yeah, come on in.  Well, it's everything I thought it would be so fun.  We're already having fun.  Oh, sure.  So I'm glad you guys came.  How are Vincent Mick feeling?  Um, well, look at his eye.  Yeah, what happened?  You should see those guys.  Oh, no.  No.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Actually, no.  It was a bad drumstick, actually.  Black guy.  Really?  Yeah.  Bounce right off the thing and got you.  I do this trick where I hit the drum with the stick and the stick flies up into the air  and the strobe lights are flashing.  Yeah.  Oh, I lost sight of it and they hit me in the eye the other night.  I thought you hit yourself with your huge heart.  Does the show stop for a minute or you just keep going?  Oh, no.  We keep going.  We keep going.  Now, do you still drum almost nude?  Because I want to know before I buy my ticket.  We're going to have to get into this tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Save this for tomorrow. 
[03:44:30]  Why did Ben send the notes that Ben says tell Jim to stop bashing XM?  Were you bashing XM?  No.  Oh, you weren't.  We're just having some fun.  Oh, we're having fun.  Stop it.  Really fast, Anthony.  Once again, we're trying to get the band back together.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
