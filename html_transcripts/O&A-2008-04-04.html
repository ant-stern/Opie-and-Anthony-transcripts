<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts introducing themselves as "radio shock jocks," declaring radio needn't be "nice," and briefly recounting a visit to a lesbian bar.  A listener named Esther, a self-proclaimed "Yenta from Brooklyn," then submitted a letter filled with incredibly offensive and anti-Semitic remarks targeting Sarah Silverman and Colin Quinn ("Big Jumbo Colin Quinn"), detailing her harsh criticisms of their appearances and personalities.  Opie followed with graphic details of a particularly pungent fart that woke his fiancée, launching a discussion about flatulence, bowel habits, and diet, referencing a *Today Show* segment on gas.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a feud with Boston radio personalities Dennis and Callahan from WEEI.  Audio of Toucher from the Toucher and Rich show was played, featuring a scathing and highly offensive rant against Dennis and Callahan, filled with accusations of hypocrisy and racism. Opie and Anthony urged listeners to contact WEEI to harass Dennis and Callahan.  The show heavily promoted the Opie and Anthony Animation Festival at Roseland Ballroom, providing ticket information and mentioning comedian appearances.  Several movies were discussed (*I Hate Sarah Marshall*, *Leatherheads*, *Chapter 27*), interspersed with listener-submitted "FU's" directed at various individuals and institutions.  Hillary Clinton's account of being under sniper fire in Bosnia, as told on Jay Leno, was mocked and questioned.  The show included listener calls, comedic bits, and a song mocking Hillary Clinton.  Big A's horrific breath was a recurring topic, culminating in plans to scrape his tongue on air.  Randy Rhodes' suspension from Air America for an obscenity-laced rant was discussed, including playing a clip of the rant.  The hosts debated the suspension, framing it within a discussion of free speech and perceived hypocrisy among liberals, mentioning Rhodes' accusations of anti-Semitism and racism against Nixon, Reagan, and Cheney.  Listener calls further explored the free speech debate, with one caller highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of Opie and Jimmy Norton endorsing Obama while criticizing liberals' stance on free speech.  Anthony clarified his criticism was aimed at political correctness, not Obama. The discussion broadened to address the state of free speech in America, drawing comparisons to Lenny Bruce and using highly offensive language to describe Hillary Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro.

Comedian Jim Jefferies joined the show in studio. A substantial portion of the show revolved around Jefferies' intense phobia of bananas, triggered by a childhood trauma.  The hosts relentlessly teased him, escalating the situation to the point where he left the studio multiple times.  This was interspersed with a "mastic moment" focusing on a Long Island town, and the planned Big A tongue-scraping stunt.  The banana phobia continued to dominate, with Jefferies returning to be further tormented with banana peels as makeshift hats.  The hosts also discussed personal items—Jeffries’ bananas, and another's sex-related item—and played a song about a banana phone.  Big A's breath became a major comedic focus, involving the crew smelling the scraped gunk from his tongue, causing visceral reactions, including vomiting and near-vomiting.  Jefferies recounted a South African story about a dangerous belief regarding AIDS and sex with virgins.  The ONA Animation Festival was repeatedly promoted, alongside a call from a shirtless Bob Kelly, who shared a story about his scoutmaster.

Jim Jefferies then recounted a home invasion in Manchester where he and a friend were robbed at knifepoint, and his girlfriend threatened with rape.  His friend’s attempt to dissuade the robbers by mentioning his child was retarded was noted, along with his girlfriend's distress over a damaged hair straightener.  The conversation shifted to Anthony Cumia's new .45 caliber pistol, leading to a discussion of gun ownership and self-defense, contrasting American and British gun laws.  Anecdotes about encounters with intruders were shared.  Bobby Kelly's crude and sexually explicit interjections and diversions, including a PalTalk performance, were frequent. Colin Quinn and Jay Moore called in, with Colin Quinn sharing a story involving Jerry Seinfeld's car.  Bobby Kelly's Comedy Central special and DVD/CD were promoted, along with Jeff Ross's experiences with threats.  The Opie and Anthony Animation Festival was again heavily promoted.

A final segment focused on the escalating banana incident with Jim Jefferies, including his repeated departures from the studio and the hosts' crude humor.  Jeffries also recounted a family story about his great-great-great-great-grandfather being a serial rapist.  Discussions of sex and sexual acts, including foot jobs and armpit sex, and comments about transsexuals and their clothing choices occurred.  A technical issue with static and crackling sounds interrupted the broadcast.  Lily's photoshoot was briefly discussed.  The segment concluded abruptly due to the technical problems and Jeffries’ final departure.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want to pet a deer.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar.  Are they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out. 
[00:01:00]  What does it smell like when one of them bust?  An old tackle box.  Where entertainment is going?  Larry King gets confused when Fran Drescher starts speaking spack.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Time to make believe we're happy to be up this early in the morning. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Well, you know, at least we're happy to be here.  But to wake up.  Yeah.  The waking up part sucks.  Yeah, that part does suck.  But then when you get here, then it's cold because we're all laughing in the office.  We turn the mics on and we come out of the box swinging, don't we? 
[00:02:00]  Don't we?  Swinging.  It's Friday.  We know that.  Yeah.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Do you love Esther, Jimmy?  You can't not love Esther.  Yeah, we have this lady Esther.  We've never talked about Esther, have we?  Esther's been writing us letters for, I don't know, a couple of years.  Years.  She's from Brooklyn.  But she openly admits she's a Yenta from Brooklyn.  And she writes these letters.  She's hilarious. 
[00:02:30]  We might have to read one of her letters today.  This letter.  But she attacks Howard so bad that, I don't know.  Just full of anti-Semitism.  Oh, you can.  See, I've been waiting for a letter where it's not all about how bad Howard is and how great we are.  No, no, no.  Which, she says this.  I've been waiting for a letter where Howard's not mentioned so we could just show you the comedic genius that is Esther, the Yenta from Brooklyn.  She's a pretty good penmanship. 
[00:03:00]  She handwrites everything on a single-spaced notebook paper.  That's a spiral notebook and it's torn out of the spiral notebook so, you know, you get all those little ragged edges of paper.  Yes.  And she doesn't seem to think that it's important to clip the ragged edges.  No.  No.  No.  Why would it be important?  It's like you would write an old love letter in junior high or something.  Apparently, there was a biography on Sarah Silverman. 
[00:03:30]  Now, I like Sarah.  I think she's funny.  Yeah.  But it was, Esther apparently has other opinions.  Oh.  Esther's a little anti-Semitic.  You think so?  Just a tad.  Yeah.  I've noticed in a few of her letters this underlying anti-Semitism.  Is there anything you could read from the letter today, Jimmy?  Well, I just want to open the...  See, this is really weird, what's going on right now.  Because she's been entertaining us in the office for, I don't know, a couple of years. 
[00:04:00]  Years.  And we just kind of chose not to read them on the air because they're just brutal.  Well, it's dated Wednesday, March 26th.  Mm-hmm.  Jasper Newton, M.D.  That's what she called me.  Better name for you than Little Pete Ferguson.  And she's right.  That was the name Colin gave me, Little Pete Ferguson.  Oh, that's right.  Wow.  I was shocked, and she underlined shocked, to see how blown up, stretched out, husky, and rectangular Colin Quinn looked.  Rectangular.  On that Sarah Silverman biography tonight on A&E. 
[00:04:30]  His face was gigantic, and she underlined gigantic.  She should have...  I thought it was going to bust through the TV.  I was also shocked at how he took part in that sissy fest with all these wussy-type guys gushing over how great-looking and hysterical Sarah Silverman is.  They all, with Colin leading the pack, sounded like an embarrassing bunch of love-struck little virgin boys who never saw a girl before.  Number one, Sarah Silverman is not pretty.  She looks like that guy from the Foo Fighters. 
[00:05:00]  Dave Roll, is that his name?  She also looks like a horse and a monkey.  I always thought she looked like she should be pulling the Budweiser wagon in a Super Bowl commercial.  That is damn funny.  And her eyebrows are so heavy and manly.  Didn't she ever hear of a tweezer?  And her shoulders are so broad, when she wears certain things, she looks like an effing linebacker.  She has to be abusing Jimmy Kimmel in some way.  And she has to be the man in that relationship. 
[00:05:30]  Maybe you should step in and have a heart-to-heart with him.  I won't say she's 100% gross.  She has pretty hair.  But she's not pretty.  Number two, she's not funny.  Her biography proved what I figured about her.  A spoiled, indulged brat with a family who hung on her every word.  Thought she was the most brilliant, talented, special, adorable, wonderful little girl ever born.  Indulged her every whim.  And she grew up thinking that she should be the biggest star in the world.  But she entertains no one except herself with her self-indulgent antics. 
[00:06:00]  Herself and that posse of her interior decorators.  Herself and that posse of male interior decorators.  Gossips and Big Jumbo Colin Quinn.  Big Jumbo Colin Quinn.  How is a screaming, I don't know if I can say it, let's just say it, a screaming, hilarious guy.  Peer, she puts.  How is a screaming pistol like Nick DiPaolo?  Yeah.  And the object of my sex dreams, Greg Giraldo.  Unknown for the most part. 
[00:06:30]  Whoever heard of them except for those Comedy Central roasts.  And this Silverman beast is being hailed as another Lucille Ball and gets a biography yet?  I wish Lisa Lampanale, the real female genius of comedy, would smack her face.  I also think Colin Quinn went berserk.  And then she signs it, it's like a Star of David with a smiley face in the middle.  Esther, blah, blah, blah, local neighborhood yenta.  She's wonderful.  Finally, we have brought Esther to the program.  We've been waiting a long time to do this.  Esther, more letters. 
[00:07:00]  I love the fact that she called, my favorite line on the whole thing is, uh, Big Jumbo Colin Quinn.  I guess we can read the letter she wrote about Howard.  Kenny's got a whole Esther file.  Maybe you can get the latest letter out of there and we'll read that for you as well.  All right.  Very, very nice.  Uh, we got lots to do today, man, for this fine Friday.  Um, what happened? 
[00:07:30]  Oh, okay.  What happened?  Well, the pregnant man was on Oprah, so we got some more.  We're going to do that a little later.  Uh, last night I was woken up, uh, in the middle of the night because my fiancee.  Oh, I was going to say, do you have guns?  Was, uh, no, no.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to, I'm in a building, man.  Oh, they never get robbed.  There's security in the elevators.  There's security in every hallway.  There's doorman.  There's that.  Yeah, assaulted.  I got double locks. 
[00:08:00]  They're not.  Robbed or killed in buildings.  They're not going to be climbing in any windows.  I know that, but.  What, are they going to be like Spider-Man or something?  Come down from the roof or something?  I don't know.  No, the, uh, the problem was, um.  Kind of answer I had there.  What?  It's a nice definitive answer I had there.  Uh, so I wake up in the middle of the night because my fiancee is gagging and choking and  trying to puke right next to me.  Okay. 
[00:08:30]  I'll tell, I'll tell you why.  Gagging like, and then after she gets through the initial gagging, choking and trying to puke,  she starts laughing uncontrollably.  I'll tell you why.  What?  Because in your sleep, you had released noxious fumes under the blanket and she smelt it and  it was just a natural reaction.  It was so freaking bad.  It woke her up from a sound sleep. 
[00:09:00]  And then of course woke me up because she's gagging and she's, she makes like cat noises.  Just imagine the female version of that.  That's how it sounds.  Unbelievable.  And then just starts laughing.  She told me that it, um, this thing smelled like, um, rotting vegetables.  How did she, how did she stay with you?  Do you think that when she walked into the bathroom, she like, she might've like breathed a little 
[00:09:30]  bit and put some cold water on her face and then caught herself in the mirror and went,  I'm a 10.  What am I doing?  What am I doing?  She went down.  She was an 11.  What happened?  Because 11 just sounds like, you know, I had to keep it in the realistic scale.  And, you know, when someone's about to puke, you got to knock them down a notch.  11 to a 10.  After they just splash water on their face in the middle of the night.  No one's at 11 when they still have vomit chunks on them.  Yeah.  But she was gagging and, uh, just, just having a tough time, but then just starts laughing 
[00:10:00]  hysterically.  Like, this is just.  Oh, she thought it was funny?  That's cool.  In the end, she thought it was really funny.  And I'm just like, I wake up all mad and I'm like, whoa, whoa.  I gotta get up early.  Oh yeah, that thing.  Are you crazy?  I gotta get up at 4.30.  What's wrong?  Was it the powerful scent of wasabi?  Did it smell like rotting sushi?  Oh, it was just, just got awful.  Cause then now I'm smelling it like, oh my God.  They should can that up to wake the deaf during fires. 
[00:10:30]  Right, exactly.  Gagging.  Unbelievable.  Are you embarrassed?  Uh, yeah, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Well, this, this, uh, this morning radio does it to you.  You just, uh.  Does it?  I don't know.  You're the only one that doesn't have a problem.  Well.  Jimmy's trying all sorts of stuff.  He's on the Metamucil.  I do the Metamucil.  Yeah, but that's because you guys are eating like Metamucil and, and, and other things.  Opie eats like, um, I don't know. 
[00:11:00]  You kind of eat like a, a farm animal.  Not only in the mornings.  Like last night, for example, I had a nice like Greek platter.  Like a, like a nice chicken kebab and rice and, and a Greek salad and bread.  Yeah, man.  And it all just rotted inside of you in a matter of hours.  I don't know.  But come, uh, the weekends?  Yeah.  Like clockwork, my friend.  One after another.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  But during the week, man, I look like that pregnant dude. 
[00:11:30]  Ugh.  I start looking like the pregnant dude by Friday because there's a lot of, uh.  A lot of pregnancy in me, if you know what I mean.  You a little bloaty?  Oh, man, am I.  A little bloaty?  Let's go to Buffalo, uh, the home of Shred and Reagan.  Dustin, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I think we need to get this Yetta on, on the show.  I want to see if she's half as quick-witted as, uh, as it sounds like in that letter.  She's, uh, she's terrific.  But she's got a, a, uh, a real hatred for Howard. 
[00:12:00]  So she usually just obsesses about him.  So we haven't really been able to read her letters on the air until today.  That was the first one that came in that didn't, uh, that had nothing to do with Howard.  Well, I gotta say I'm impressed.  Yeah, well.  A long time we were sharing you, and, you know, I've been a fan of Howard, too.  I, uh, you know, I like to talk radio, but.  Okay.  I really think that we need to hear more from her, because that was impressive.  Well, I, she listens, she listens every day, so I, I suggest that Esther, like, writes about  other things, because, uh, she definitely has a way with words. 
[00:12:30]  Big jumbo Colin Quinn.  Esther, can you just write at least just a page about all the things Colin reminds you of?  Speaking of, uh, speaking of gas, what the hell, we'll throw it in here, even though we  have a very busy day, a lot of things going on in the news.  We have another mastic moment, which is going to be terrific for everybody.  Uh, this Today Show, that's on every morning, they, uh, they have four hours of programming  now. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And they, uh, learned a while ago that, that fourth hour is a little rough to fill up with  material.  Yeah, see?  A little rough.  Have fun.  Um, so they're just doing really just dumb stuff.  Mm-hmm.  And millions and millions of people are watching this.  This isn't like a little college radio TV show.  Yeah.  All access, you know, like a, what, what, cable access show.  It's the Today Show, an establishment, right?  Listen to what they were filling up their fourth hour with, uh, recently.  Okay, passing gas. 
[00:13:30]  Moving on, another great topic.  Yeah.  Everybody does it, right?  Everybody does it.  How many times a day?  You know, we actually, the average is between 14 and 20 times a day.  Wow.  So, you know what, we're all doing it.  Woo!  Clear the room.  Exactly.  When the hell did this happen?  Boring.  Boom!  They're talking about, uh, passing gas.  Yeah.  On the Today Show.  On the Today Show, yes.  There's a war going on. 
[00:14:00]  If you can't fill up a fourth hour with a war going on.  With all kinds of details on the war and, and, uh, what, what, what, what is going on  with the, the news, the fake news, the not even close to news anymore news?  It's just beyond me.  Well, that wasn't all.  They kept going.  And this is totally normal.  But again, there are certain foods that can produce it more than others.  I mean, beans, we kind of all know that one.  But broccoli, certain vegetables.  Vegetables, again, the starches. 
[00:14:30]  The leafier, starchier.  Yes.  Exactly.  And if you swallow too much air, it's going to come out the other end.  So things like chewing gum or drinking carbonated beverages, that can produce more gas.  So do you know when you should be seeking medical attention?  Well, again, if it's something that's new or abrupt for you, if it's accompanied by pain  or it's some kind of diarrhea or constipation, you may have irritable bowel, you should talk  to your doctor.  Okay.  Oh, you should talk to Eastside Dave.  I don't know.  I didn't realize. 
[00:15:00]  Do you know what?  That was actually helpful.  Why was it helpful?  I swear to God, because we all know that I have a reputation.  Yes, you do.  But I drink a lot.  I try to cut down on Diet Coke, but I chew a lot of gum.  I always chew gum.  Yeah.  Because I got much more obsessed with gum when I quit smoking.  You think you're sucking in a lot of air?  Apparently.  Wouldn't that make you burp, though?  Yeah, burp and go the other way, too.  Sure.  What's the food that does it for you, Jimmy?  Oh, what's the food that doesn't?  Anything lactose. 
[00:15:30]  Broccoli is a biggie for me.  Ice cream is a biggie for me.  Because I never thought it was so much.  Beans is a huge one for me.  Oh, God.  Kashi's Autumn Harvest.  Why are you even eating that?  Which we have in the office.  Eat the box.  I avoided it the last couple of weeks to save you guys, but Autumn Harvest.  It's like shredded wheat, but it has a little cinnamon on it.  Yeah.  I didn't think it was so much air you're taking in your mouth as it is whatever gases are being  let off by the digestion process and then building up as it works its way down your intestine. 
[00:16:00]  Like, I know you can burp a lot if you're sucking a lot of air.  But as you're swallowing air, it just makes the release that much worse because now there's more of it flying at you.  Is there?  Oh, yeah.  I'm just going to do that today.  I'm trying to find my stupid Steve clip.  Hey, let's say hi to Rick in Alabama.  Rick, what's up?  Yeah, I was just going to let you guys know I've been trying to call your boys in Boston there. 
[00:16:30]  And when I got through, well, actually, I didn't get through.  But when I was, you know, they'd probably just be like, oh, when the hell did this happen?  So, you got somebody in Alabama trying to do some testing for you.  Were you trying, sir, were you trying to get in a Back to the Future reference?  Yeah, I guess.  When the hell did this happen?  Yeah, that's kind of what he was going for.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:17:00]  Well, could you do it again, sir, while Homer responds?  Yeah, can you try that again, please?  Yeah, give me your best shot.  Give me your best shot.  When the hell did this happen?  Boom!  Oh, well.  He goes, oh, well.  Here, I'll save your phone.  Have a good day.  I'll save your phone call.  I'll give you one of these.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Grr, grr.  Yeah, grr, grr, grr.  Speaking of that fine station, W-E-E-I.  Yeah.  Those dopes, Dennis and Callahan. 
[00:17:30]  They started the week by going, I wonder what ever happened to the guys that did the mayor's  prank.  They must be working at a McDonald's or...  Uh, yeah.  And then made a pedo joke, so now they're just suffering.  The listeners are just calling their show, calling every other show on the station.  The wrath of the pest.  Yeah, it's just been beautiful to follow.  And know who jumped on board yesterday?  Who?  Toucher from Toucher and Rich.  Heard on BCN in afternoons.  Wow.  Hopefully we're going to have the audio in a little bit here, but Toucher went off on 
[00:18:00]  these guys yesterday for us.  Just went off.  Was it intelligible?  I don't know.  Could you hear it at all and understand what he was saying through the slurred words of  a drunk?  I'm very excited to bring some Toucher and Rich audio to everybody today.  Sure.  We've been talking about this alcoholic for what?  Six months or so?  We actually only saw the guys once when we were up there.  It's about time.  It was a party. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And he was having some fun.  Some?  At the party.  He had fun for about 10 people.  And now we just have him pegged as drinking constantly.  So Sam's working on that.  Because Dave Wellington, the fine PD up there, he was all excited.  He sends me an email.  He's like, oh, Toucher really went off on these guys for you yesterday or today, whatever.  And I wrote him back like, why wouldn't you send the audio so we could play it on the  show?  Yeah.  I want to hear what Toucher had to say.  We're good like that.  We are good like that. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  It's also FU Friday.  We're just getting warmed up.  Oh, Jimmy, Animation Festival?  What's going on with that?  Oh, yeah.  At 8 o'clock.  It's an hour and 45 minutes from now, depending on where you're listening.  Here in New York.  I take it, Master.  The Animation Festival is Thursday, June 5th.  And it's a huge first prize they're working on getting, so send in all, or you have to  mail in all of your submissions because we need clear quality to show them.  And it's going to be done at the Roseland Ballroom Thursday, June 5th.  We could not get the venue for free. 
[00:19:30]  You can't do it here in New York.  It's $10 tickets plus a service charge.  We kept it as cheap as we possibly could.  And believe me, it's going to be a great night out.  A lot of the fans just hanging out, getting together.  Roseland's a great venue for this.  We will be tipping a few back, which is nice.  Tip a few back with the listeners.  And you get to watch some comics and these animations that people have submitted.  Yeah.  Like a little festival. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  We're finally bringing it all together because we've played some of these animations during  the comedy tour last summer.  They got a great reaction.  Yeah.  They get a great response on all the websites that they're featured on, including iTunes.  We're in the podcast section of iTunes, and they got free O&A animation downloads.  Free in the podcast section.  And then you go to onaradio.com, and you get CokeLogix animation.  So it's become this thing on our show.  And finally, we want to feature the best of the best and award the winner of the best animation. 
[00:20:30]  And it's just going to be a great hang for everybody.  I think we're going to have at least 20 animations that we're going to be playing on June 5th at  the Roseland Ballroom.  And a couple comedians to mix it up a little bit.  All the surprises, hopefully.  Can we have girls involved somehow?  Something sexy?  That would be...  Sexy?  That would be very nice.  I would love that.  Tickets, like Jimmy said, $10.  A little bit of a service charge because it's Ticketmaster.  But here's the key.  Tickets go on sale at 8 a.m. this morning.  And all the info about the O&A animation festival is up on onaradio.com. 
[00:21:00]  We'll be back.  China Light opens up in theaters today, right?  Got a little stones for you in the background.  Oh, we got the Martin Scorsese.  Yeah, yeah.  It's getting like three stars, I believe.  Leatherheads.  Was it called Leatherheads?  Helmetheads?  Yeah, that's that...  The George Clooney movie?  George Clooney early days of football movie. 
[00:21:30]  I think it is Leatherheads.  Leatherheads is getting like two, two and a half stars today.  I've been trying to find a movie to watch.  I went and saw I Hate Sarah Marshall last night with Roland.  Yeah, that's advertised everywhere.  That movie is good, man.  Is it?  Yeah, really good.  You went with Roland?  Well, me, my girl, Roland, and...  And Roland's friend.  Ooh. 
[00:22:00]  I'm just joking.  I'm only joking.  Roland hangs out with very, very timid fellows.  Oh, really?  That doesn't surprise me.  You like movies about gladiators?  I Hate Sarah Marshall's going to be a huge hit, though.  Very funny.  Very funny, yeah.  Jonah Hill's in it.  He doesn't have a huge role, but the guy is just naturally funny.  You know, the dude from Superbad?  Sure.  He's in it, and that chick's in it.  See, I need Roland here.  I wasn't planning on going in this direction. 
[00:22:30]  Let's put it this way.  Very, very funny movie.  I Hate Sarah Marshall.  I don't know when it comes out.  Maybe next weekend or something.  I hear the movie with...  Someone said they saw Judah's in it.  I mean, he's got a good role with Jared Leto.  Chapter 27?  With Lenin Assassination?  Yeah, I got a copy of that.  I haven't checked it out yet.  Yeah, they said Judah's great in it.  Really?  Movie's getting kind of reviews, but I hear Judah is good in that.  Yeah, Fast, because a lot of really good roles, man.  You know what?  I'll check that out this weekend.  I'll have a full report on Monday, I guess.  Do you have a copy of it?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Roland gave me a copy of that. 
[00:23:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've been talking about this toucher guy for a long time.  Finally, we bring some toucher and rich audio to the rest of America.  Yes.  They do afternoons on BCN, that fine station we're being heard on right now.  And how did this start?  And would you want to set this up with the whole Denison Callahan and WEI thing?  Yeah, they're douches.  Ah, douches.  Yeah.  They, I guess on April 1st, they were talking about April Fool's gags or something. 
[00:23:30]  They're doing a break on that.  Do we have that audio?  See, that would be good to play right now, see?  Yeah.  That's kind of self-explanatory if you play the audio.  Yeah, why don't we play the audio?  It frees me up from having to explain it.  It all started with this on April Fool's Day, just a mere, what, two or three days ago.  So we're out of time.  We can't do our top ten April Fool's jokes of all time?  The mayor's dead.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  No, the mayor's alive, kicking. 
[00:24:00]  He's happy, healthy.  Out riding his bike every morning at 5 a.m.  I'm not going to give you ten.  I'm going to give you like three or four out of the top ten April Fool's hoaxes of all time.  Whatever happened to those idiots that said the mayor was dead?  They're like working at that McDonald's with the child molester.  Working at the McDonald's with the child molester, which was a big story in Boston.  It's like, you know exactly what happened to us.  Stop being dishonest.  Is that how we were able to rally the troops to ruin your show on a daily basis now?  Because the pests are just killing you? 
[00:24:30]  Well, they asked the question, whatever happened to those guys.  So we decided to have the pests call them up and tell them exactly what happened to us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now Toucher and Rich have joined the war.  Yep.  And this is what they were saying yesterday afternoon.  WBCN 104.1, The Rock of Boston.  With the whole Unfunniest Comic and Everything, we've been talking about Opie and Anthony a lot recently.  But I want to talk about...  Wait, that doesn't sound good.  Unfunniest Comic. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, wait a minute.  We've been talking about Opie and Anthony a lot lately.  I'm insulted.  Right.  He's got to get his thoughts together through that booze haze.  The whole Unfunniest Comic and Everything, we've been talking about Opie and Anthony a lot recently.  But I want to talk about one thing because it really pissed me off.  Opie and Anthony were talking about this.  WEEI.  Dennis and Cowan are the biggest loser hypocritical bastards.  They were talking about, on April Fool's Day, the incident where Opie and Anthony, when they were here, they said the mayor was dead and then they got in trouble and got fired. 
[00:25:30]  And they were saying something like it was, they were comparing them to pedophiles working at a McDonald's and claiming not to remember who Opie and Anthony are, which is ridiculous if you're in the business.  You obviously know who they are.  Ooh.  Nice.  Maybe he's not drinking anymore.  He sounded really coherent.  Very clear.  Got to go to another party with them.  Yeah.  River Rave.  Those guys know how to party.  Yeah.  We're going to do River Rave with those guys.  We were in a little meeting yesterday and that subject came up and, yeah, River Rave is great. 
[00:26:00]  I think we're doing River Rave with Toucher and Wretched and the rest of the gang at BCN.  When is it?  Do you know?  No.  I should know.  Oh, they're going to kill me now.  Did they announce it?  Somewhere like late May, early June.  I wasn't asking you.  I was asking Iraq.  Oh, okay.  Of course, he didn't have the information prepared.  No.  Wasn't that the 31st or something?  You ready for this?  That was just the setup from Toucher and Rich.  Here we go.  Dennis and Callan have a tremendous amount of balls to go after anyone for a mistake that 
[00:26:30]  was made on the radio, considering that when we started here, the first 25 days was beat  into our heads about their Metco guerrilla thing that they said, where everyone said that  they were racist and they got suspended.  You hypocritical bastards.  You Benedict Arnold, stupid pricks, resting on your laurels.  I hate nothing more, nothing more when these old, washed up, craggly, loser nothings just 
[00:27:00]  sitting on their asses, picking their butts, writing horrible articles in the Herald.  Hey, you know something?  I don't appreciate them talking about our program like that.  I thought they were our friends.  No, compared to Dennis and Callahan.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I thought they were commenting on us.  No, compared to Dennis and Callahan, we work our asses off on the radio.  Yes.  Picking their butts, writing horrible articles in the Herald, sit around and act like they're  so superior to everyone else and turn their back on their broadcasting brothers and sisters. 
[00:27:30]  There comes a point where you turn off the shtick.  Just stopping the tape, the controversy they're referring to, there was a gorilla that got  loose, remember?  And the Boston Herald, I believe, had a picture of this said gorilla kind of hanging out at  a bus stop.  Yeah.  And they made some jokes about that.  Yeah, a racist joke.  Extremely racist jokes were made.  They got suspended. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, so they got themselves in some trouble.  So for them to go after us and, you know, talk about what we did, it's ridiculous.  Well, you turn off the Nazi garbage little thing that you've made up for yourself.  First of all, one of you is 98 years old or something like that.  The other one of you, as far as I'm concerned, is a no-talent hack that walks around behind  the guise of, oh, I'm telling it like it is, right-wing nutjob.  What do you really believe?  I find it very difficult to believe you hold the positions that you talk about. 
[00:28:30]  Your show is unbearable to listen to.  You pay the guests you get.  You do nothing.  You don't ask any kind of leading questions.  You're no-talent idiots who just happened to be born in the right place and not die of  old age.  That pisses me off so much when people come after different broadcasters for that.  You hypocritical pricks.  Considering that I knew about what you said in another market.  Boy, does that piss me off.  So whatever Opie and Anthony want their listeners to do to those stupid, loser, hypocritical,  Benedict Arnold bastards, I suggest you do it. 
[00:29:00]  It drives me insane.  Thank you.  Wow, we're getting everyone fired up.  Damn.  Fired up.  Fired up.  This guy's fired up.  This toucher.  Fired up.  And then he wraps up.  That's all I got to say about that.  Turning your backs on it.  And you know what?  Slow clap.  I bet you no one was attacking you.  I bet you Opie and Anthony weren't attacking you when you made the mistake and said something  that was blatantly racist and so stupid because it was a hot-blooded issue of bussing in Boston 
[00:29:30]  and then you stupid idiots open up the paper and that's your act?  That's your act?  Comment on the front page of the paper?  And then it turned around and from what I heard, proving yourself by having black friends  of yours talk on your behalf.  Idiots.  Idiots.  They could put anybody in that morning show and it would succeed.  Idiots.  Don't know who Opie and Anthony is.  Screw you.  How much do you love this guy?  That's great.  How much do you love this guy?  That's fantastic. 
[00:30:00]  That's just wonderful.  Yes, Jimmy.  I didn't know that Denison Callahan had their own problems.  Oh, of course they did.  Maybe that's his idea of trying to be like a community activist.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, we'll rail against those negative type of jocks.  That's right.  Just forget about what we said, though, about the whole...  The whole busing thing.  The gorilla's hanging out at bus stops.  We're at a bus stop.  There you go.  It feels good that someone is helping us out.  Yeah.  Usually we're in this alone. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, I know.  This whole, you know, taking on all of radio.  But I think we might have found some people that we can hang with a little bit.  It's going to be sad when we hate each other.  Yeah, it'll happen.  It'll happen.  I'm kidding, really.  I hope I am anyway.  Look at our relationship with Ron and Fez.  Right.  It's lasted for years.  Yeah, but it's not shaky ground.  Let's be honest with each other.  I couldn't imagine not liking Ron and Fez.  Oh, shaky ground, you think, a little bit?  A little bit, a little bit, yeah.  There's some cracks in their relationship. 
[00:31:00]  Oh.  I think it's over the staff.  You think?  Yeah, because we kind of, we're trying to steal people from them.  Well, they stole first, though.  Yeah.  They took Big A and Stalker Patty and did a lot of stuff with them.  So we're taking Eastside Dave.  It's only fair.  We want Dave.  But there you go.  So the war continues in Boston with WEEI.  Mm-hmm.  What's the number?  Yeah, of course.  Oh.  Oh.  Whoa.  Sorry, Rock.  I'm very, very sorry. 
[00:31:30]  That hand came right up.  It's right in front of you.  Not hey, oh, but it's right here.  It's very stupid.  I'm very sorry.  Yeah, he did.  He was kind of like calling you stupid, Opie.  If you want to join the war, the phone number for WEEI, and we want everyone to suffer.  Mm-hmm.  And I apologize to Mike Adams because we know the guy, and he's kind of fun, and he's just  insane when he's working on that station.  So it's kind of like collateral damage.  What can I tell you, Mikey?  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about the calls you're getting.  But knowing Mike Adams, he's enjoying it.  Secretly, he's enjoying the awful phone calls from the past. 
[00:32:00]  But around the clock, call WEEI.  888-525-0850.  And make sure you listen to Toucher and Rich later on this afternoon if you're in Boston.  Take a personal interest in making you suffer.  All right.  Love it.  Very, very good.  Moving on to other things.  We had Hillary Clinton on Leno last night.  I love how they're doing all the late-night shows now.  Like, that used to be something a presidential candidate would never do. 
[00:32:30]  It was kind of taboo, right?  Yeah.  It was one of those things that...  You just didn't do.  You didn't do it.  It was beneath you as a presidential candidate.  And now they all do it.  I think it really started with Bill Clinton.  Because Bill Clinton went on Arsenio.  He played the saxophone.  And it really helped him out.  He came off like a regular guy.  But that's Bill Clinton.  You can't just throw a candidate on a show and they can fit into that whole atmosphere. 
[00:33:00]  Yes, Jimmy?  Didn't Carson have...  I mean, the old footage with Richard Nixon, I think, was on Johnny.  I think Johnny...  Was he on Johnny?  I think RFA.  Really?  I think Robert Kennedy was on it.  Reagan was on Carson.  Well...  I don't know.  I always thought...  Call me a douche.  No, I'm with you.  And I thought it all started with Clinton.  I know Nixon said, soccer to me.  I'm laughing.  That's true.  Yeah.  I want to say Nixon was on.  I want to say that...  Unless I'm mixing it up with Jack Parr.  But I think that both of them... 
[00:33:30]  And I think even Robert Kennedy.  Okay.  Well, it continues.  We had Hillary Clinton on Leno last night.  Making fun of herself about the Bosnia incident, by the way.  Really?  Good to see you.  Oh, it is so great to be here.  You know, I was worried I wasn't going to make it.  Oh.  Yeah, I was pinned down by sniper fire.  Really?  Right out here.  You know, in L.A., that might be true, actually.  Oh, I know.  Well, I mean, this has just been, you know, such a mismatch of words and actions. 
[00:34:00]  And I was thinking about it because, you know, obviously I've been so privileged to represent  our country.  Right, right.  Gosh, more than 80 other countries.  Lots of war zones and all the rest of it.  And, you know, I wrote about this in my book.  And then I obviously just had a lapse.  Okay, yeah.  So, here I am, safe and sound, and proud of all of our...  A lapse in what?  Yeah.  What is a lapse? 
[00:34:30]  What's a lapse?  She was trying to say, but then she...  I think she figured that we would look into that as well.  She?  That she was under sniper fire, but in another incident that she's confusing with Bosnia.  Oh, gosh.  But then she stopped short of actually saying that.  Yeah, because that's what it sounded like she was trying to do.  Say, well, you know, I have been under sniper fire, but it wasn't in Bosnia.  Yeah, I just got confused.  Yeah.  But then she stopped herself because she knows that's a lie, too.  Lewinsky was under sniper fire in the Oval Office.  Boy, was she.  Took a few direct hits. 
[00:35:00]  I had a lapse.  I was in Geraldine Ferraro's lap, and that's what I did.  Oh, just an insincere phony.  She cannot sound natural.  She cannot sound like a human being when she talks.  Yeah.  Everything is so calculated.  Ugh.  Did you hear that?  It didn't even sound like...  Oh, gosh.  I had a little trouble coming here. 
[00:35:30]  Pause.  Mm-hmm.  Comic timing.  Well, that was written for her.  You know that.  Of course it was.  Well, we took the Bosnia sniper thing, and we did a little something-something.  Mm-hmm.  Hillary Clinton is running for president.  Hillary!  Hillary!  Hillary Clinton has a spotty memory.  I certainly do remember that trip to Bosnia.  These events never happened.  And I remember landing under sniper fire. 
[00:36:00]  Alzheimer's is a devastating illness that affects millions of people worldwide.  Okay, listen up.  Did anybody see a sniper?  Did anybody see anything?  Anybody see a sniper?  Including Hillary Clinton.  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport.  Murph will receive an enemy sniper fire.  Eight ball is down.  But instead, we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicle.  Give generously to the Hillary Clinton Alzheimer's Foundation. 
[00:36:30]  It was a moment of great pride for me.  This promotional message is complete bull.  Unbelievable.  Let's say hi to Jake in Chicago.  Jake, what do you have for the show?  Yeah, who could miss Hillary?  She talks about this sniper fire.  Who could miss Hillary Clinton with that big friggin' head of hers?  Yeah, really?  That's a huge target.  I wish Leno would have said to her, I'm not sure what you mean by lapse.  She was so kind of vague.  It's like, did you just out and out lie when you told that story?  Yeah.  How could that happen? 
[00:37:00]  She did.  And then she's on Leno and she's trying to glaze the whole thing over as this lapse she had.  Right.  I don't think you have a lapse if you're under sniper fire somewhere.  I think it's something that would probably stand out in your head for the rest of your life.  You would remember that one.  Sergeant G from Iraq, he writes, I think she means she's been running laps.  Look at those calves.  And then Steven S from Bayshore.  Bill went on Arsenio and played the sax.  This, this, can't say that word because someone got suspended for using that word right there, 
[00:37:30]  Steven S.  This W.  Mm-hmm.  Got it?  This W?  Yeah.  Somebody of questionable.  Look, I'm not.  I'm not sexual morality.  Steven S. writes, Bill went on Arsenio and played the sax.  This whore went on Leno and blew her own horn.  What a self-serving sow.  Hmm.  I hate to do this to you.  I really do. 
[00:38:00]  What happened?  I really do hate doing this to you, too.  What happened?  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand.  East Wisconsin, Ohio.  Texas and on to Penn State.  She's gonna do it.  Give her just a chance.  She'll make it.  Shut up.  She's got a feeling she'll break it.  She's gonna be your president.  Yeah.  When the hell did this happen?  Nothing's gonna turn her back now.  Straight ahead and on the track now. 
[00:38:30]  With plans to make our dreams come true.  Hillary Clinton, there is nothing she can't do.  Really?  Never heard of what is possible this time.  There's no time for a chance.  She's gonna do it.  On your mark, get set and vote now.  Got a dream and lots of know-how.  With plans to make our dreams come true. 
[00:39:00]  Working for us all day.  Yes, all day.  It is really.  Make all our dreams come true.  Working for us all day.  Yes, all day.  Make all our dreams come true.  For me and you.  I don't want to play that song anymore.  I really don't.  I just love when she kicks in and really goes for it. 
[00:39:30]  The first part of the song.  We're gonna do it.  That answer is.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Pops.  Oh, I don't think she's gonna do it.  Oh, she's not gonna do it.  No, I don't think she's gonna do it.  Let's say hi to Gary in Rockland.  Gary, what's up?  Boys, good morning.  Good morning, Gary.  I think we got a perfect opportunity for the bleep game.  You heard some good bleeps in that?  Let's see.  With the Leno audio? 
[00:40:00]  That's a good shot.  All right, we'll give it to young Sam and see what he comes up with.  Run it through the lab.  Yeah.  Back in the Institute.  Absolutely.  Can I ask a question?  I'm looking at onaradio.com.  Uh-huh.  Is that really?  Is that Larry King's hair?  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, it's not his hair?  No.  Oh, okay.  But he does look, Larry King does look like that little monkey.  Yeah, what kind of monkey is that?  Who did this?  I don't know.  Steven S. from Bayshore?  That's a monkey that throws feces. 
[00:40:30]  The feces-throwing monkey.  Looks like a little rhesus monkey.  If you go to yesterday's rundown that Steven S. from Bayshore writes on onaradio.com, he has  a bunch of pictures of Larry King, and the one with his hair all the way up in the air  is hilarious.  Yeah.  I really thought that might be his hair.  With a little Photoshop going on there?  Okay.  And then he's got Larry King, well, a monkey with big Larry King glasses that look-  Looks just like Larry King.  It certainly does.  I look like a monkey.  Comment. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Hey, we're just under, well, just over an hour away before our tickets go on sale for  the O&A Animation Festival.  Very exciting.  All you need to know is we're doing the Animation Festival Thursday, June 5th at the Roseland  Ballroom here in New York City.  Tickets go on sale at 8 a.m. this morning through Ticketmaster, $10 ticket, a little bit  of a service charge, but make sure you get your tickets.  I think this is going to sell out fast, okay?  Yeah, it's not a massive venue.  It's like it's much smaller than the Beacon.  It's much smaller than a lot of the bigger venues here.  I think it's around the same size as Town Hall.  I think we're only talking 1,800 tickets, and I think these will go fast, especially because 
[00:41:30]  it's a very, very cheap ticket.  Going on sale at 8 a.m. this morning.  We're going to Ticketmaster, okay?  Very exciting.  Very exciting.  It's also FU Friday.

[00:43:00]  FU.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd just like to say f*** you to the state of Illinois for passing a no smoking law.  Like it's going to keep any of you non-smokers alive for any f***ing longer.  F*** you.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big FU to little Jimmy Norton.

Opie and Anthony.  We've got our new friend,  Jim Jeffries,  coming by once again.  Really funny guy.  He just belongs on this program.  Unfortunately,  not...  Unfortunately for us,  not for him,  he travels pretty much the world  to do his comedy.  Yeah.  So we only get to see him 
[00:47:00]  like every six months.  Mm-hmm.  So he'll be in again today.  He's playing Caroline's  here in New York City  all weekend long,  so make sure you check him out.  Also, Big A is here, Jimmy.  And we're going to scrape  his tongue today.  Oh, that's today?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  We don't know what we're going to do  after we scrape his tongue,  but it's going to be horrific.  Oh, I got the heebie-jeebies.  I wish Bob Kelly was here today  because that would be...  That would be the thing.  Let's see who the bigger man is.  I know you're not going to do it,  but I'll...  Well, I don't get involved. 
[00:47:30]  I will go for a sniff.  Jimmy, will you go for a sniff?  I don't know if I can.  What?  I don't know if I can.  You have to.  I don't know if I can.  Seriously?  Yeah.  All right, we'll line up some people  to go for a sniff  and see what happens.  I just got so grossed out  thinking about it.  We love Big A,  but he has horrific breath.  Horrific.  And after this bit today,  we might have to do the right thing  like we did in the past  with Stalker Patty and stuff  and get him some real help.  Dynamite for his mouth.  Maybe we'll just get some pliers  and just pull his teeth out 
[00:48:00]  one by one today  and really do him a favor.  Gargle with OxyClean.  Yeah, exactly.  877-212-ON-A.  You know, it's a very interactive radio show,  so give us a call.  Jimmy is just fired up right now.  I almost...  It's almost like a joke.  Air America host suspended  for obscenity-laced rant  against Clinton and Ferraro.  Yeah.  Air America radio has suspended  talk show host Randy Rhodes.  You just like the name.  I certainly do. 
[00:48:30]  And that wispy, blonde, hairy head.  I've heard Randy Rhodes.  She's a really good broadcaster.  I don't agree with what she says  for the most part.  She's a liberal dreck.  She's extremely liberal,  but she's very good at saying it.  She has a very entertaining program.  Yeah, I'll say for the record,  I think that most of her politics suck.  Yeah.  But the fact that she's been suspended,  it's embarrassing.  Rhodes used obscene language  in her choice remarks  at a March 22nd appearance  in San Francisco.  It was sponsored by 
[00:49:00]  Air America affiliate station,  and apparently it was some kind  of a stand-up routine.  This was not like an on-air thing.  This was not like  in a political debate.  This was a stand-up routine,  and we have the audio, I think.  Yeah.  But Air America,  this is the, you know,  Charlie Kirker,  who's like the,  he's got something to do  with Air America.  Air America encourages  strong opinions  about public affairs,  but does not condone  such abusive and hominem language.  H-O-M-I-N-E-M. 
[00:49:30]  I don't even know  what that means.  Yeah, I've seen that word  over the years.  Gay, I think.  During what was  an apparent stand-up routine,  I'm gay, man.  Rhodes attacked Ferraro.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  I can't let that fly.  Of course not.  Boo!  All right, sorry, Jimmy.  During what was  an apparent stand-up routine,  Rhodes attacked Ferraro,  the former vice president,  or candidate,  for saying that  Clinton rival Barack Obama  had benefited  in the Democratic presidential race  because he's black,  which Ferraro  had to apologize for.  Yes.  And Ferraro's another worm. 
[00:50:00]  Geraldine Ferraro  turned out to be  David Duke in drag.  Who knew?  So just Randy Rhodes  is just a liberal dummy.  But she said it to laughter  and she was kidding.  What a whore  Geraldine Ferraro is.  She's such an effing whore.  Now, obviously,  she's being funny.  She's tagging a joke with that.  Right.  And even though  I don't like the point of her joke,  that's what it is.  It's a joke  and you know it's meant.  And then a few minutes  she said that Hillary's  a big effing whore  and she suggested Hillary  was trying to force her way,  whatever she said.  And of course,  Geraldine Ferraro,  this David Bowie-haired 
[00:50:30]  49-state losing  with Mondale nothing.  Yeah.  Was it 49 states?  49 to 1.  What state do they win?  I don't know.  Does anyone know?  Their husband  with questionable finances.  In a way,  this makes me want to throw up.  And in a way,  it's like,  this is a world  that liberals recently  And it's like,  yeah,  I'm sorry it happens.  I don't like seeing  any radio personality  getting screwed  for what they're saying.  But, you know,  she made her bed  with the liberals  and the liberals love  this political correctness 
[00:51:00]  and everyone should  go through a life  without being offended.  Well, this is what  Geraldine Ferraro said.  So, enjoy it.  This is what Ferraro said.  Rhodes should be fired.  Of course.  Why?  Well,  what they did with Don Imus,  what did they do  when he went to Don Imus  when he went after  a young black team  who was playing basketball  with that kind of language?  Treat them both the same,  Ferraro told Fox News.  She's coming at me  and Hillary  in a sexist way.  No one,  I don't think anyone  would confuse 
[00:51:30]  those two women  of being whores.  No.  Because you have to have  willing participants.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You ugly,  ugly,  self-important monster,  Ferraro.  You're an ugly monster.  And you would be a whore,  but you're not attractive enough.  Right.  That's what we're saying.  Too ugly to give it away.  You gotta kind of be good looking  to be a whore.  The great Elmo Hughes,  my brother,  who's hanging out  in Huntington,  I guess he's awake right now,  he writes on the instant feedback,  ad hominem means attacking  the person, 
[00:52:00]  not what he says.  Oh, I see.  So in a stand-up routine,  which I guess is what it was,  now this sissy  who runs Air America  or whatever he does for them  is kind of putting  like boundaries  on what you should talk about  in a stand-up routine.  Yeah, this didn't air.  I can't make that clear enough.  This wasn't on the air.  Well, I'm hearing it did air.  Hey, I'm an idiot then.  Oh, this,  what do I got in front of me?  I'm a little confused,  E-Rock.  Hey, somebody was videotaping  the event  and leaked it on YouTube  and it just came out this week 
[00:52:30]  and they suspended her,  I think, on Tuesday.  Oh, okay.  So she was doing an appearance  for one of her affiliates.  Yeah.  Okay, now,  all right,  here's the deal.  She's doing an appearance  for one of her affiliates,  KKGNAM in San Francisco.  So she's not on the air,  but she's doing an appearance  for the affiliate,  says these things,  and that's what got her suspended.  That's amazing.  It's that,  that,  and know who,  who is very,  very scared?  Club sort of Kenny  picks me up.  He goes,  did you hear about Randy Rhodes?  Wow. 
[00:53:00]  You think this could affect  little Jimmy Norton  and what he does on the road?  God.  No.  That's what Kenny said  on the way in today.  Mr. Panic.  No, it couldn't.  You want to hear what you said?  I would never not say  what I want on the stand-up stage.  Yeah.  Ever.  Under any circumstances,  when I allow a company  I work for,  but not the CBS or XM,  I don't think would ever try to,  they've never even hinted at that.  No.  Yeah.  But this is a world that,  the conservatives have been  pigs with free speech 
[00:53:30]  since time out of mind.  But in the last 20 or so years  with political correctness,  this is the one that the liberals  have grabbed the ball with and ran.  And it's like,  it's frightening to me  that this can happen to somebody.  Why wouldn't Air America come out  and go,  we found what she said offensive,  but we do have a free speech  in our country.  Of course.  And we defend her right  to say what she wants  even though we find it repulsive.  Especially in parody.  Right.  As you're up on a stage  trying to be funny. 
[00:54:00]  You want to hear what you,  Yes.  Of course.  Charlie Brown turned out  to be the David Dukin drag.  Oh no.  I don't have no idea.  She's like,  why am I the bad guy here?  I just don't want  an anti-Semite racist  in the White House.  Like Nixon.  Or Ronald Reagan.  Or Dick Cheney  who moved to Wyoming  so we would never have to see  a black guy or a Jew ever  as Bill Rock  for Vice President 
[00:54:30]  of the United States.  Do you know what's interesting?  It's interesting.  It's hard to hear.  How the,  well she said,  she was accusing like Nixon  and Reagan  and I think Cheney  of being anti-Semite racist.  Yeah.  It's funny how the guy  from Air America  didn't consider that  an attack on who they were.  Right.  As people.  It's funny how that,  that completely  politically correct douche  noticed that the attacks  on Ferraro and Clinton  were attacking who they were.  Yeah,  but not Cheney  or Reagan.  So don't call them 
[00:55:00]  effing whores  because that's attacking  who they are.  But call someone  else in politics  who's conservative  anti-Semite.  Anti-Semite racist.  Racist.  Right.  Good.  Okay.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob,  what's up?  Hey,  what's up guys?  How's it going?  Good man.  Hey listen Anthony,  I gotta give it to you man.  You stand up.  You're a stand up guy.  Opie and Jimmy,  they're two hypocrites  because  they talk about  this Libyan  and they talk about  the liberals,  this,  this guy.  And then they endorse  or they say  they're going to vote  for Obama. 
[00:55:30]  I also start,  hold on,  hold on,  you're not going  to get away with that.  I started this off  by saying  that since time out of mind  the Republicans  and conservatives  have been complete pigs  about free speech.  Now just because I find  political correctness  repulsive,  it doesn't mean  that I'm not going to  go against Obama.  You understand what I'm saying?  Yeah,  but he's more liberal  than anyone you're talking about.  I get it stupid,  I get it.  But that doesn't make me  a hypocrite  because I like  one guy  over another guy  and I still hate  political correctness.  You're talking about  the liberals.  You're talking about 
[00:56:00]  the liberal ideas.  I'm talking about  the liberal connection.  Hey,  stupid,  I know what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about  the liberal connection  to political correctness.  And don't think  that the conservatives  would come to bat  for free speech  like that either  because they would  let you swing in the wind  if the advertisers  walked away from you.  So shut your mouth,  you idiot.  Stay with your point  of view,  Anthony.  Of course.  You're an ill-informed dummy.  Ciao.  You know,  all these candidates  scare me  as far as political  correctness goes. 
[00:56:30]  Not McCain.  Huh?  McCain and Giuliani  were the only two  to come say  I misapologize.  Yeah,  actually McCain  did the right thing  when it came to that.  You're right,  Jimmy.  So I completely agree  with him on that.  But first of all,  I'm not voting.  I don't vote.  I don't,  for the most part,  I don't like politics.  I think it's a big joke  and I don't think  anything changes  in this country,  you know,  for the most part.  Our taxes are still  completely out of control  and all that.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I just want a black guy  in the White House  because I think  it would be interesting.  Something different.  You just want  something different.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[00:57:00]  I know that's so lame  to say and it's so basic  but that's really  the reason I want  Obama in the White House.  Something different.  I think it would bring  excitement to this country  and it would make  things very interesting.  You know something?  Planting landmines  in your living room  would make excitement  in your life too.  True, true.  You know,  it might hurt  after a while.  It might cause  some problems.  I really don't think  in the end  it's going to hurt anything.  You don't?  Nah.  You don't?  It would be fun  to say,  hey,  I was alive  when we had  the first black president.  Is that something 
[00:57:30]  you want to be able to say?  The system is in place,  Anthony.  What?  One man doesn't make  that much of a difference  anymore in this country.  You know that deep down.  You know that.  Well.  You know that.  No, I don't.  You know that.  I do.  No, I don't.  The case of like  a Kennedy type person  really, you know,  making changes.  It's just,  it's not going to happen.  To his hairdo.  That's a little too neat.  Let's must that up.  All right,  back to Randy Rhodes.  And by the way, 
[00:58:00]  this is something  that liberals have not done  is as much as I find  her political reviews  just repulsive,  I would,  she should not have  one negative repercussion  due to what she said.  She should not be suspended  even for a day.  Absolutely not.  And it's funny,  nobody comes to other people's aid  when it comes to stuff like this.  Everybody's afraid.  Everyone hides and goes,  ah, don't connect me with this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of the point where  now it doesn't even  have to be broadcast.  Whatever you're saying, 
[00:58:30]  people want your job.  They want you to be fired for it.  This Geraldine Ferrara,  ugh,  she just wants,  wants people to lose their jobs.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Why?  Because you're personally insulted  by something someone said.  Why are they giving her attention?  I don't really get it.  Yeah,  why did she come out  of the woodwork?  Just because she's a broad  that once ran?  Who cares?  Yeah.  The vice presidential  kryptonite candidate.  She hasn't been heard from 
[00:59:00]  in like two decades.  Yeah.  And now people are-  They drag her out  because she has a vagina.  Right.  It's pretty much why  they drag her out  because Hillary's running.  And she just said something  racially that she had  to double talk on  and then Hillary just lied  about being in a war zone  and basically spitting  in the face of soldiers.  Yeah.  And Ferrara wants  Randy Rhoades fired.  It's mind boggling.  We got it.  What phonies we are  as Americans.  We should get Sean Hannity  on today.  Scary.  Charlie, Jersey,  what's up?  Yeah, morning, guys.  Hey. 
[00:59:30]  I was listening to  Sean's show last night  and he pretty much  agrees with you guys  as far as  Randy Rhoades  not being suspended.  He's been very consistent  whether it's  I miss you guys,  Randy Rhoades  that, you know,  especially in a venue  like this  where it wasn't  even on the air.  You got the right  to say what you want to say.  Yeah, Sean Hannity's  been great over the years  with defending free speech  even if he personally  doesn't agree 
[01:00:00]  with what they're saying.  Yeah.  Why?  Thank you, Charlie.  Why do people feel  that if you're offended  that that gives you  this right  that the country  we live in  you have a right  to not be offended.  It just,  it's not,  we don't have a right  to not be offended.  People have a right  to offend you  with their speech.  Yeah.  That's what this country  is about.  Yeah.  But not anymore.  It will threaten  your livelihood. 
[01:00:30]  That's disgusting.  All right, let's  We're soft.  We're soft.  Americans are very soft  and have become  disgustingly dishonest.  Yeah.  Let's get back  to the Randy Rhoades thing.  So this is what  you got in trouble for.  Have I earned you ever  as Bill Rhoades  for Vice President  of the United States?  I mean, it's like  unbelievable to me.  I can't believe  it's what a whore  Jeremy Corrado is.  She's such a  f***ing whore  I like  She's killing. 
[01:01:00]  A huge laugh.  I want to see her  have to stand  beside her husband  at one of those  mandatory  I have sinned  against you  I'm a whore  kind of a  press conference,  right?  Mr. Corrado  should have to stand  next to his horrible wife.  She's doing stand-up.  Yeah.  He really is  just doing stand-up.  Yeah.  I don't think  she was literally  saying that  Geraldine Ferraro  goes out  and has sex 
[01:01:30]  with a lot of people.  I don't think  she was saying that.  No one would confuse her  of being an actual  whore.  There is a figurative  use of the word  whore  and bitch  that I think  she was using  that they parade  that they parade out  this Geraldine Ferraro  for Hillary Clinton's sake  and  whore her out.  There's a different  it has a different meaning.  The word whore  doesn't just mean 
[01:02:00]  sexually promiscuous.  I mean you could  whore yourself out  for a cause.  The same as NBC  saying that they  pimped out Hillary  and I'm sorry  pimped out  Chelsea Clinton.  And this  by the way  the guy  Charlie  Caricker  or Caricker  he's the Air America  chairman  and just another  phony  another phony  free speech  is only free speech  if it goes  hand in hand  with what I think  free speech should be.  We just suck.  People have lost  any courage 
[01:02:30]  and this doesn't  even take courage  it's amazing  that I'm even using  the word courage.  They've lost  any courage  to stand  behind somebody  for what they  say  regardless if you  agree or not.  No one will  stand behind you  and  these are the people  that should be there.  Your employer  if you're a broadcaster  should absolutely  stand behind you  unless you're  you know  unless you're  saying something  really outrageously 
[01:03:00]  stupid  irresponsible  dangerous  they should  stand behind  your opinions  and Air America  way to know  your audience  I mean  she's in front  of her audience  killing  they're loving  what she's saying  they love this woman  and you turn around  and suspend her  for what she said  it's ridiculous  how funny  is it that the left  is just biting  their own tail  on this one  I mean  the ultra liberal  being dumped  by the ultra liberal  it's just hilarious  it's like  why don't you  just defend  they're eating  their own  and it's great  to see  hey  we gotta get 
[01:03:30]  this in too  this is what  Randy Rhodes  said about  Hillary Clinton  Hillary  is a big  f***ing whore too  okay  I didn't know  what I can say  I was like  I don't know  what I can say  I don't know  how they vote  I don't know  what the deal  she is a big  f***ing whore  and you know  why she's a big  f***ing whore  because her deal  is always  redefine  print  f***ing  you know  like I said  f***ing you  but I didn't say  f***ing you  you know  she's like  the super delegate  oh no 
[01:04:00]  nevermind  the super  the pledged delegates  aren't legally  obligated to do  anything  oh f***ing you  you know  just f***ing you  they're not legally  bound to do  anything  she said  and if that doesn't  work  you know  she's going  all Lieberman  on you  right  because it's that  northeastern politics  it's very  very tough  everything  is a f***ing  scandal up there  everything is a  scandal  and you're doing  all of it  all the time  there's nothing wrong  with what she said  no  she was killing 
[01:04:30]  the audience seemed  to enjoy what she was  saying  I didn't hear any  boos  boo  I didn't hear that  we're heading back  to the days  of Lenny Bruce  it really  it's embarrassing  I can't believe  we're going backwards  you know  Lenny Bruce  would get arrested  for his stand-up  routine  we're slowly  not even slowly  we're heading back  toward those  those days  and it's amazing  how people always  find a reason  why it's okay  to not allow you  to say something  no one ever says 
[01:05:00]  I'm a freedom  of speech  repressing  slob  they always have  a reason  because nobody  wants to admit  that they are  that self-centered  that they wouldn't  want somebody else  to say what they want  it's too self-revealing  to admit that  so you find reasons  if you're a conservative  it's family values  if you're a liberal  it's hate speech  your sex is  everyone has a reason  as to why their speech  should be allowed  and yours shouldn't  it's sickening  they never stand up  for the person  ever  and I hate Randy Rhodes  she should not  stop any repercussions  believe me  let's go to Charlie 
[01:05:30]  in Jersey  Charlie  hey what's up guys  hey Charlie  just a quick point  how do you think  these liberals  that are fans of her  that would definitely  get out in droves  to support the firing  I am it  how they're coming out  now that happened  to one of their own  gotta love liberal  on liberal crime baby  liberal on liberal crime  that's funny  I'd be interested to know  her take on Imus  like what was she  as a radio person  what was her take  I'm wondering  did she call for  to be fired  maybe one of our guys  could just look for that  if there's anything on it  yeah that's a very good question 
[01:06:00]  let's go to Rob in Jersey  Rob  hey good morning guys  how you doing  good morning  I just want to send  a special F you  out to all these politicians  who talk to talk  but can't walk the walk  ooh that's a good one  as far as what you guys  as far as what you guys  were talking about  as far as  you know these guys  not having the courage  to stand up for what it is  they don't have courage  they got no balls  just be a  be a man  have some balls 
[01:06:30]  stand up for what you believe in  that's all  they don't even know  what they believe in  these idiots  yeah  how impressive  would Hillary be  if she came out  and said I heard  what she said  it's kind of repulsive  it's personally offensive  to me  but  she has the right to say it  yeah  of course in this country  there's a right  to say things like this  I think she would get  a lot of respect  if she came out  and said that  I really do  she's unrespectable  because what  what is offensive  in society  changes  like you know  oh well back 
[01:07:00]  when the forefathers  wrote this  that wasn't  that would never  have been said  yeah but certain  things about  black on white  relationships  was considered  offensive  back  you know like  it always changes  with the time  Jefferson called Hancock  a douche  I think  forefathers  we're always  calling each other  names  wow  it's got the  phones lit  let's say  hi to Eric  in Indiana  Eric  hey what's going  on guys  yeah I agree  with what you're  kind of just  saying that  you know  nobody has  the balls  to just stand 
[01:07:30]  up and say  hey I'm offended  they all go  behind people's  backs  and use lawyers  and litigation  and sue  because their  feelings got hurt  I mean come on  it's so stupid  if a person  has the right  to say whatever  they say  then why don't  you have the right  to stand up  and say hey  that bugs me  you know  there's a  what people do  now too  is they say  hey I'm not  saying they don't  have the right  to say it  but there's  going to be  repercussions  to everything  that you say  and yeah  the repercussions  should be  another person  voicing their 
[01:08:00]  opposing opinion  because that's  a dialogue  that's debate  that's what  freedom of speech  is based on  not a fear  that you  are going  to lose  your livelihood  over what  you said  that then  doesn't  it's not  free speech  anymore  that is  a speech  that is  costing you  something  it's costing  you your job  but they will  say that is  just a  repercussion  of what you  said  you have  free speech  but you have  to then pay  the price  of that freedom 
[01:08:30]  and again  the price  should just  be a rebuttal  from somebody  maybe calling  you an a-hole  not agreeing  with you  out talking  you in a debate  to make you  look stupid  whatever it is  but it shouldn't  be the fear  that you're  going to lose  your livelihood  because that  takes away  freedom of speech  when you have  fear  from what  you're saying  and that fear  could be  losing your job  or losing  your life  it's a fear  once you place 
[01:09:00]  that in the  way of speech  you're taking  away freedom  of speech  that's what  they've done  with these  firings  very good  Anthony  let's go to  North Carolina  Ryan disagrees  Ryan  hey buddy  hey uh  America  is not even  liberals anyway  it's got  a margarine  a bunch of  characters  they're just  a bunch of  fake liberals  they don't care  about progressive  ideas or anything  like that  what's happening  is that  people that  support Hillary  Clinton  don't like her  at all 
[01:09:30]  and they don't  want to  want her  fired  she was on  the air  saying she's  just like Bush  because she's  using the same  fear tactics  like the 3 o'clock  in the morning  phone call  so it's got  that to do  about free  speech  it's about  Clinton supporters  having the money  in the back  and saying hey  we want her  fired because  we don't want  talking bad  about her  yeah but you  know what dude  don't let  Air America  off the hook  as far as the  free speech  issue is concerned  either  because Geraldine  Ferraro came out  publicly saying  she should be  fired  and that's not  being done  behind closed  doors  that's being  done publicly  and she's not  being penalized 
[01:10:00]  for criticizing  Hillary on the air  she's not being  criticized for  railing against  Hillary in a  political sense  she's being  criticized for  saying offensive  things in a  stand-up performance  so what you're  saying would be  accurate if that  happened on the  air during a  political debate  where she like  bad-mouthed Hillary  but this was  something she said  that was offensive  on a stage  as a comic  and she's being  penalized for it  it is a free speech  issue there's nothing  more to it  we joked about this  when the whole  limas thing went  down that  eventually they're  going to like  start going into  comedy clubs and  comedy settings and 
[01:10:30]  going after people  remember we said  this exact thing  like the next step  here is you know  they're going after  radio guys who are  just trying to be  funny and entertaining  their audience  now they're eventually  going to go into  the comedy settings  and get comedians in  trouble for saying  outrageous things  for saying what  they're saying  yeah  we kind of said  that in an act  we sort of said  that as a joke  but wow today we  wake up and  they're doing just  that  the beauty  the beauty of  stand-up  I tell you it's  like throwing up  every night  it's like it is 
[01:11:00]  you get to attack  anything that happens  that I can't stand  on the air here  I can attack there  and it just it feels  so good to get  that stuff out  I mean as a comic  you can't ever be  told not to say  something on a  nightclub stage  you can't  yeah I thought  Lenny Bruce fought  for that right  but it looks like  we're slowly going  back toward getting  in trouble for saying  stuff in comedy  clubs or comedy  settings  same people that  would have defended  Lenny  like the same  like you know  hipsters that  would have said  man he got  yanked off by  the man 
[01:11:30]  yeah  the same ones  now that would  say well  club soda  Kenny  when he was  performing was  disgusting  he did homophobic  and pedophilia jokes  and she was  disgusting  she called them  more  everyone has a  reason  yeah  yeah  all right  obviously an  ongoing topic  with this fine  radio show  this won't  ever end  we have to  take a break  we got Jim  Jeffries joining  the program next  we got Big A  here he's gonna  get his tongue  scraped  see we do  all sorts of  things with this  we're all over  the place  we got a  mastic moment  right after the  break  that's a freedom  of speech should  be taken away  from Big A  you think 
[01:12:00]  he shouldn't be  able to open  his mouth  ever ever  and let's not  forget  the first annual  ONA animation  festival is going  down Thursday  June 5th  at the Roseland  Ballroom here in  New York City  this is all you  need to know  today peeps  gonna call them  peeps today  tickets go on  sale starting at  8 a.m.  in just over a  half hour from  right now  tickets are only  $10 and you  can get them  through Ticketmaster  okay  and all info  about the ONA  animation festival  is up on  ONA  radio.com 
[01:12:30]  moving right  along with the  Opie and Anthony  show we got  Jim Jeffries in  studio playing  Caroline's here  in New York City  tonight tomorrow  and Sunday  and Sunday  yeah  very very cool  757-4100 is  the number for  tickets  yeah we're  we're hitting a  lot of things  right now a lot  of things talking  about free speech  you got that free  speech in Australia  I'm sure they do  they still get 
[01:13:00]  mild racism  kicking on for  years and years  I'm sure they  have free speech  in Australia  not in America  it's always handy  free speech is  going away in  America  how have you  lost it  where have you  lost it  ah yeah  you used to be  able to say  things on the  radio  now you're not  allowed to  there's this  cloud of fear  over everybody  like you still  technically have  freedom of speech  because you can  you have the  physical capability  ability of saying  anything but the  repercussions they 
[01:13:30]  used to just be  debate you know  people would then  top you and make  you look silly for  what you said and  that's the  repercussions but  now the repercussions  are you lose your  job your livelihood  there's this fear  over everybody that  what they say is  going to get them in  so much trouble that  they can end up  losing your house  your family  no they definitely  have the same  problem in England  I don't know about  Australia but they  definitely have the  same problem in  yeah just ridiculous  let's go to Dan 
[01:14:00]  in Wisconsin  Dan  hi Dan  good morning boys  how are we doing  are you a cheesehead  yes I am  forgot about that  he's a cheesehead  I never expected  to be able to say  on the air that  you guys are the  absolute voice of  reason when it  comes to freedom  of speech but  my god even back  when Imus was  you know getting  fired you haven't  said on the air  that you would  defend Howard's  right as much as  it repulsed you  to defend Howard  if he got fired  for something like  that and I just 
[01:14:30]  have to point out  you guys have been  the most consistent  position of anybody  on the radio for  freedom of speech  and I think it's  awesome  you gotta be  you know what's  weird about us  we pretty much hate  every other radio  show out there  but we're the only  ones that defend  every other radio  show out there  when they get in  trouble for saying  something  and we're the  first ones that  gets crucified by  99% of the radio  personalities when we  get in trouble for  saying something  good they should  be taken off the  air  yeah we yell  and scream at  those people like  don't you understand  they're gonna come  after you next 
[01:15:00]  you're next  idiot  yeah  oh I don't do  shock radio  you don't have to  anymore  no  you just have to  say something that  offends somebody  and you're gone  by calling Hillary  Clinton a whore  right  that's not really  shocking  no especially when  it's not on the air  and it's a live  stage show  right let's go to  Mike and Beth  Page  Mike what's up  hey I got something  better to talk about  besides his politics  okay righty  how about a more  important subject  like a mastic moment  and now it's time  for a mastic moment 
[01:15:30]  as Opie and Anthony  take a glorious look  at this majestic  Long Island community  Anthony you want to  do a little reset  for Jim Jeffries  because he's sitting  there like what's  a mastic moment  strangely enough  this ties into  freedom of speech  and what we were  talking about  mastic is a small  town out on Long  Island here in New  York it's a hell  hole it is a crap  hole it's it's very  small a lot of 
[01:16:00]  impoverished people  living there the  property values are  in the crapper we  saw a house that you  could buy for $1,900  $1,900  yeah I know we were  just like let's just  buy some houses in  mastic screw it  and a DJ out there  in Long Island made  some dumb white  trailer park  trailer park type of  joke and got in a  lot of trouble and  actually got suspended  from his radio show  yeah for saying that  and we defended this  guy we hate this show  he does but we 
[01:16:30]  defended the guy  how did the rednecks  get together to  actually get lawyers  and stuff and get  angry it was uh  yeah if you can't  get out of bed in the  day and you're a  drunken how do you  get complaining going  well there's so many  people I want to  want to fight against  but I just can't be  asked I can't really  do it yeah it's  ridiculous and this  town uh some of the  um leaders of the  town I guess uh got  together and complained  and uh called the  radio station got this  guy suspended for  making a trailer park  joke  kind of innocent joke 
[01:17:00]  so we're we're like  all right we're gonna  take up the fight and  now we're gonna tell  everyone what  mastic really is all  about because we're  from Long Island very  familiar with mastic uh  and we know it's a  crap hole it's one of  those towns that if  you live on Long  Island you know it to  be a crap hole like  wine dance like  Brentwood I mean to  the rest of the  country these names  mean nothing but just  insert the town around  you that you know and  everyone knows is is a  piece of crap town  half of Amityville  right Amity yeah uh 
[01:17:30]  North Amityville  South Amityville very  nice I'm just saying  half yeah half of that  town exactly is a  horror show and around  the country like I  said just pick a town  you know it you know  it there's towns near you  that you know are crap  towns mastic is one of  our crap towns so now  we just uh stick with  the facts okay yep and  uh we got a mastic  moment here Long  Island duck gets order  of uh protection a  duck like any other  victim of a violent  attack circles the duck  now has legal protection  an order of protection 
[01:18:00]  against the man charged  as her assailant in  addition to getting  shot in the neck by a  pellet gun Suffolk  prosecutors said circles  of mastic managed to  make legal history  yesterday was the  duck eating spaghetti  at an Italian  restaurant how's the  Italian food here  to my knowledge it's  the first order of  protection for a pet  in Suffolk County  outside of domestic  violence cases said  uh prosecutor Michelle  all letter yeah uh the 
[01:18:30]  attack was quick said  circles owner Janet  Lippincott a group of  teens jumped the  backyard fence and  charged her uh with  pellet guns uh yesterday  the yellow bill peking  duck the same variety  as Long Island duck  fame scored a legal  victory the man police  say is her attacker  wow you like Matthews  Y-L-I-K yeah Y-L-I-K  Matthews a mastic pleaded  not guilty to felony  animal cruelty charges uh 
[01:19:00]  judge John wow  L-L-I-O-U  L-L-I-O-U  issued a full order  protection for  Lippincott's family  including circles  Matthews uh was held on  bail of five thousand  dollars cash or ten  thousand dollars bond  good luck getting it  according to court  papers you ready for  this the single pellet  pierced the duck's  larynx larynx shattered  shattering a bone around  her voice box and 
[01:19:30]  leaving two holes on the  opposite side of her  neck  circles is back to  sleeping in the dog  crate she shares with  two pit bull labrador  sisters viper and  sweetie  what you're saying the  pit bulls never went  for the duck first like  the pit bulls have lived  with this duck for how  many years  yeah nice peaceful  living with the duck  I have no problem with  someone hurting a duck  I eat duck  you know as long as you  eat the animal  I don't think they were  eating it 
[01:20:00]  yeah but you know what  I thought I think  kill them cows and all  that  I think Jim is right  Jim Jeffries is right  as long as you eat the  animal you should be able  to do whatever the hell  you want to him  now before you determine  they're just like bait  just change its name to  Jack Klugman  quack  quack  dogs hired the guy to  shoot it in the throat  so they wouldn't have to  hear that stupid quacking  don't kill it  because we kind of like her  we bang her  I think it probably was  like a loud  mack  mack  mack  mack  mack  mack  all the time  and just I'm going to  shoot that thing in the  throat  I think the animal's  owner is quite sadistic 
[01:20:30]  yeah  poor circles has his  injury and then you  put it back in the  crate with pit bulls  well weren't they  buddies  yeah they were  they were pals  yeah  they grew up together  you don't think the  the dogs are kind of  looking at that duck  going yeah I know  we're buddies but I'm  a little hungry right now  maybe they're well fed  who knows  and that was a  bird's eye view  into the scenic town  we hold close to our  hearts  a mastic moment  on the Opie and Anthony  show  let's go to California 
[01:21:00]  Mike what's going on  today buddy  hey not much  I've got a thing about  Big A's teeth  or tongue scraping  yeah Big A is here  and we're going to  scrape his tongue  yeah just take all the  remnants from it  water it up and give it  to E-Rock as a breath  man  wow he's implying your  breath is worse than  Big A's tongue scraping  Jim Jeffries saw some  amazing stuff on our  show yesterday and we're  going to try to top that  today Jim Jeffries  I'm not going to mention  it  we got Big A he has 
[01:21:30]  horrendous breath  I've smelt it  I have been close to it  you don't even have to be  close to him  who's going to be  scraping it who's  holding the scraper  he'll scrape it  he'll scrape his own  tongue  if you never I'm a  scraper if you've never  scraped before he'll gag or  something it's not it's not  an easy  I scrape my tongue  I really try to keep my  mouth in shape here and  when I scrape my tongue  every morning it's just  ugh  I can't even imagine  I can't imagine what's  going to be on that  scraper  did we get like the  scraper  no I don't like the  toothbrush  it matters up the 
[01:22:00]  things when you're a  smoker I get big yellow  chunks coming off the  thing after  yellow and brown  yeah yeah  you ever take a whiff  you ever take a whiff  oh yeah yeah  just imagine on Big A  I hope they got the  right scraper  please tell me you got  what you got to get the  one that looks like a  spoon if you didn't get  the one that looks like a  spoon we got to go back  out he's going back out  right because the one  that looks like a spoon  when you scrape and then  turn it over nice you got  a spoonful of custard I  like to call it a spoonful  of goop yeah Jim 
[01:22:30]  Jeffrey's like oh I'm  getting a little disgusted  and then we're gonna we're  gonna collect this and  then I don't know what  we're doing yet I think  we're gonna line up a  bunch of guys and see who  can handle the goop the  best believe we have five  guys willing to do that  it's amazing to me yeah  what's gonna happen is it  five guys gonna eat it or  something no no just to  smell it not to eat it  smell it how much would  you pay someone to eat it  oh hundred bucks give him  ten dollars I got I got  yeah no I think that's  worse than yesterday you  think that's worse than  yesterday I think eating  that stuff with the tongue  is worse than yesterday 
[01:23:00]  then what uh what's this that's  not a tongue scraper yeah well  that's after the fact I think  when did we get that let's  see turn that around we just  sent him back out why do we  not get this yesterday no you  gotta get the uh no no no no  this is kind of more this is  like a tongue brush you need no  you know you need it looks like  a spoon it really looks like a  spoon it's like a scoop yeah  you're scooping what's on your  tongue off tongue spatula and it  collects in the middle of this  like uh scraper I'm getting so  grossed out and then uh we'll  we'll get a whiff obviously 
[01:23:30]  none of these guys scraped  their tongue they have no  idea what to get from the  store he just scraped  something off his tongue he's  not lying that's like a mini  tumor you just remove from  your tongue I didn't do it  today I had to get up very  early I need a good scraping I'm  in desperate need of a scraping  Jimmy's face you're right  Jimmy I'm just thinking of the  four or five volunteers that  are gonna have to smell that's  horrid yeah absolutely even that  was rude I must stink today I  almost stink today you guys will 
[01:24:00]  talk about me when I leave I  stink I stink well you can use  that other tongue scraper they  got because we're not using it  for the thing yeah Eastside Dave  would be interested huh Eastside  Dave you hungry are you still  full from yesterday I gotta tell  you I was saying before I told my  mom about that and what happened  yesterday yeah and she didn't  believe me it was like when you're a  kid and you go and then he did  this and then this happened and she's  like come on James yeah stop making  stories up it was the end of the 
[01:24:30]  show got horrific yes it really got  probably into some of the most  disgusting stuff that's ever  happened on the program yeah we had a  naked man Eastside Dave from the  Ron and Fez show he he was completely  naked because he does this segment  for us it's called guess what Eastside  Dave is hiding in a certain place on  his body but we yeah but we don't  talk around the issue when we do the  bit but you're right no no no he's got  something but believe me he put on his 
[01:25:00]  naked body he puts something  somewhere yeah and we do a question  and answer thing like a 20 questions  thing asking yes or no questions until  we figure out what he is hiding in this  certain place on his body and then he  removes he slowly and painfully  removes the object and holds it up  with pride and then we'll use the  object like what was it yesterday  it was a packet of cigarettes pack of  cigarettes yes a pack of cigarettes and 
[01:25:30]  he took him them out and and then put  them in his mouth yes which is really  disgusting yes absolutely but then it  got even more disgusting because I guess  he had an upset stomach yeah and what he  did in the studio has never been done  before I had enough believe when you  have an upset upset stomach yeah there's  something you can do to relieve the  pressure I think everyone on an upset  stomach everyone he did that right he 
[01:26:00]  did that in the studio pretty much  ruining a garbage can ruining more than a  garbage yeah much yeah pretty much  ruining then broke my soul then Sam tried  to attack him and trim more of his hair  off his head with a razor well we got  to explain we got this dumb little bit  called Afro Wars it's our guy Sam  against Eastside Dave from the Ron  and Fez show Sam has a huge afro at  this point and we thought we ended the 
[01:26:30]  contest because we pinned Eastside Dave  down about a week ago yeah we said about  a week ago and we shaved a reverse  mohawk into his huge bushy hair and we're  like any contest Sam wins Afro Wars we did  a little wrestling thing the contest can't  continue you lose he decided I'm still in  this yeah and and he's still growing the  hair even though he has like an old man  horseshoe now but it's really really  bushy on the sides so like no man so we  try to pin him down again yesterday to  really end this Afro Wars and get him with 
[01:27:00]  the with the clippers right and he's still  completely naked so he uses the only defense  he could possibly use and that is taking  his hand and placing it somewhere right  the cigarettes were yeah yeah yeah where  where where he would hide the cigarettes  yeah and then removing his hand from that  area his hand is now visually contaminated  visually contaminated and he was chasing his 
[01:27:30]  assailants around the studio he was with  one hand he looked like the Heisman  trophy look chasing someone around we  had we had about eight guys that were  trying to attack him pin him down so we  could like finally end this Afro Wars yeah he  was able to hold off everybody everybody  with this hand going around with one hand  like a superhero and then everyone would go  back like you see those movies with the  caveman and they see fire for the first  time that's how our guys were backing off 
[01:28:00]  and then my hand and then money was paid  to him to remove the visual atrocity from  his hand yeah with his mouth yeah Gigi Allen  is alive and well and he did 2008 he did  and he started throwing up into the same  garbage do it once yeah yeah I think Jim  said it's not clean keep going keep going  it it made everyone pretty much start 
[01:28:30]  dry here you could rob a bank like that  people always want to have hostages and  stuff like that if you're like I don't  know what they call linebacker or something  like that just do that with your hand and  run hand first yeah hand first people get  out of your way it was so disgusting  uh and that's not a bad scrape that one  that's are we getting better but it's not  the scoop oh how much money are we going to  it away how much money are we going to  waste on on tongue scraper 84 50 there's 
[01:29:00]  one that it's an actual spoon steve it's  a spoon you can pretty much eat ice cream  with this thing and you scrape see that  that's more of a how do you explain that  well it's it's like a bent bit of metal  that you have at the end and then you  put all right it's yeah there's no way to  collect a good bonus smart floss  I don't know how it's different to normal  floss why don't we just get a spoon  well we can do a spoon no no this you can  get heaps off with these ones maybe get  heaps off of this one like Jim Jeffries 
[01:29:30]  just said and then we will work with that  in a spoon I am if this is done wrong  people will be fired sorry we have to  fire that's the right time to get it  10 of 8 on the air yeah that's time to  get it all right I'm in advance and look  them over you do yeah right in prime  time so with that said we're going to  try to do some with this this tongue  scraping today to maybe people well we're  not gonna equal yesterday it was one of  the greatest moments in radio history  disgusting not something I'm going to 
[01:30:00]  put on my resume I've ever done the  show I thought that was just one of  your bog-standard ones I  you were trying to tell your your mom  I try to tell me mom me mom tell me mom  tell me mom and she was you're just  making things up what are you always  making stories up you don't have to  lie I love you I'm your mom she doesn't  really love me no we heard she knows she's  mental my mom my mom I had a friend 
[01:30:30]  commit suicide a while back I'm trying to  cheer you thing but I had an argument with  her before she committed suicide that day  but I rang my mom up and and and I go  I go um okay I said some awful things  mom and she goes well James in your life  you're gonna you know say hurtful things  to people that you don't mean but you  just try to you know minimize these  things so they don't happen again right  because I'm just happy I've said some  awful things in my life but I'm just  happy that I never said to anything bad  to you or your brothers I'm like what  did you do when you left the house we 
[01:31:00]  just like stabbing people in the street  or something last time I was home I got  woken up by this 400 pound woman  bashing into my room going I want you  to know that when I'm dead in many ways  you've been a huge disappointment to me  and the reason for that is the reason  for that is because I didn't show her  some photos and I showed them to my dad  oh she's mental she used to beat the  hell out of me I got scars on my really  she used to hit me with a belt buckle  from a scout belt right because I  wouldn't go to scout the reason I  wouldn't go is I was being molested  every day I was there oh my god oh 
[01:31:30]  wow why would you go I don't want to  go boom you must have been an adorable  little kid now it explains all the  stories you told us yesterday yes it  does right Jimmy  now we understand why you do what you  do sexually I had my space messages  just a row of 20 when I got back to the  hotel yesterday that just said gay  you got molested at boy scouts oh it's 
[01:32:00]  scouts yeah yeah yeah yeah he never  actually physically inside or anything  whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah well was that  all right you think probably not used to  just put me in a corner and anyway it  wasn't a good day either way you look at  it wasn't a good day what would he just  what was it was he into just looking at  you and the thing is he always wanted  you to call him Barloo through the whole  experience he never lost these you know  seniority from the jungle book what did he  make you do and you got to kind of keep 
[01:32:30]  it like sort of vague uh it was we'll  figure it out a lot of a lot of swearing  and sitting in the corner and and like it was  like being in the front row at SeaWorld  oh no okay oh Jesus wow oh god when  Shamu uh yeah flips up in the air  caution you may get wet  that was that was the best way i could  describe it  i thought that was pretty good the way i  danced around there  wow oh god so this was going on at scouts 
[01:33:00]  you go home and now you decide you know  it's in my best interest not to go back  there anymore and now you're getting  carbs actually  and now you're getting beat by your mom  yeah and so i mean because you won't go to  scouts to get uh molested basically  thrash me with the the belt buckle of the  scout belt  when the hell did this happen  and those scout belts they're like they're 
[01:33:30]  like those big buckles and everything it  wasn't yeah it wasn't nice in the end my dad  found out i tell his i tell this a little bit  in my routine but i'll mention anyway in  the end my dad found out i swear to god  this is what he said he comes to me and he  goes uh i went with me mate who had also  happened to and my dad said you've done  the right thing by coming to see us and i  want you to know that you've done nothing  wrong and he's done everything wrong and  he's going to get what's coming to him  and then my dad hugged me and looked at  me and went i wonder how you got all  those badges and people think i made that  oh wow i swear to god that's all the thing 
[01:34:00]  is i respect my father so much for that  because i believe comedy is all about  taking risks and my father was holding  his molested child and he thought no it's  a good one  maybe i'll get a joke here  i'm just gonna let this one fly i'll just  work it in did you laugh no i didn't  really get it i can promise you later on  that evening he was in the pub with his  mates going and then i said  let's uh let's say good morning to  cleveland we got pete on the line pete

[01:41:30]  with milk shooting out of it  brrrr  brrrr  you're being very cruel  I just  that's his kryptonite  he doesn't like that  but it's amazing  see my problem is now  because  he wrote  Robert Kelly  he tells everybody  and some guy  in I don't know  Wisconsin or something  rings up and tells me  that I don't like bananas  I thought it was a fairly  well kept secret  and now there's going to be  like people at the show  tonight just with a banana  just sitting on their knee  just in the front  have them thrown out  oh yeah  have them thrown  if you bring a banana 
[01:42:00]  you will be thrown out  of the venue  I once  I once  shagged a bird  want to say that word  oh sure  I once shagged a bird  and she put a condom on  and it was banana flavor  but I didn't know  and it was banana  I vomited all over  with that artificial  that artificial smell  of  you don't even like  the smell of bananas  so you don't like  any  banana flavors  let's just see what happens  just hold this banana  I'm not going to hold it  I'm not going to hold it  it just ain't going to happen  hold my banana  something happened  did the scalp 
[01:42:30]  I was  but I mean  was I molested with a banana  no no  by breakfast or something  where that smell  it's a visceral reaction  probably  my mom said  even as a baby  I wouldn't eat  like mashed up bananas  I remember my brothers  used to hold me down  and mash banana  into my head  oh what bastards  yeah but I didn't like it  before then  they would do that  because you didn't like it  it wasn't the cause of it  they weren't mashing  bananas into your head  that's what they told  your mom 
[01:43:00]  your mom  right  opi why are you being  such an ass  to our guests  I'm just showing love  man we love this  Jim Jeffries guy  how would you like  if someone brought  a vacuum in  and just started  vacuuming around  you  don't you like vacuums  bit over  he hates  bit over  Anthony figured out  a way to make you stop  why wouldn't you like  vacuums  bit over  bit over  the sound 
[01:43:30]  of a vacuum  drives him nuts  really  yeah absolutely  nuts  my mom would vacuum  our house  I don't know  hours at a time  and we'd be  watching TV  and  and when they  found that out  lift your feet  listeners would start  calling  listeners would start  calling and over the  phone just play them  the vacuum sound  and it would freak  them out  I'm like  exhaust fans in  like bathrooms  it's the same sort  of sound  no it's just  vacuums  I'm lucky enough  now in my life  to have a cleaning lady  and she comes 
[01:44:00]  once a week  and she was vacuuming  the other day  I had to leave  the apartment  really  I had to leave  the apartment  alright see  look what it does  I love that sound  it sounds good  that's my thing  yeah I like that sound  and just like you  I don't know why  it can't be just  because my mom  was vacuuming  a lot as a kid  but look at my arm  goosebumps right away  from the sound  of a vacuum  can I feel them  yeah here you go  you know what  that was very sensual 
[01:44:30]  what the hell  you know what gets me  you know the air hose  on a compressor  use it like  to clean up  if you work  in a shop  you use it  to blow off  sawdust  or metal chips  off a lathe  or something like that  to put it  a little too close  to your arm  and hit the air  and it  it like  makes your skin  go like  a little bit  that  I can't even  deal with that  how often  does that happen  well you know  something  in the  when you're  working a shop  it happens a lot  yeah  because you're 
[01:45:00]  like cleaning  stuff up  and just the air  coming out of the  nozzle  kind of gives me  the heebie jeebies  I'm sadistic though  I will do a bit  where we get a lot  of vacuums  turn them on  all at the same time  I want to see  how many vacuums  I can take  before I actually  have to leave  the studio  because I will  leave the studio  eventually  I don't think one  the one makes  the goosebumps  pop up  immediately  and the hair  on the back  of my neck  but you know  when someone  is reminding us  we're missing  the obvious here  what  Maury  Maury fears  oh my god 
[01:45:30]  yeah  you would be  perfect on  Maury Povich  because he has  people confront  their fears  you know  to help them  whoa  the banana  is getting  loose in my hand  don't  whoa  it has a life  on its own  you know something  whoa  stop it  this isn't even  good radio  people at home  we're already  bored of this  this is boring  Jim has been  nothing but a  great guest  on our program  and you're  rewarding him  by being a douche  I won't vomit  or anything  I'm alright  my ex-flatmate 
[01:46:00]  put a banana  in my underwear  drawer  and I punched  him in the head  and I made him  wash all my  underwear as well  it's weird  because you look  down  like you  you can't make  eye contact  with the banana  or the person  that is holding  the banana  you can't look  down and shy  away from the  microphone  watch  whoa  it's that  little flinch  that a dog  gets that  you've hit  a lot  yeah that's  exactly what  you look  like  no no no  don't give  it to  you can't 
[01:46:30]  watch people  eat a banana  the whole  density of  the thing  and they  chew it  oh my god  why are you  doing this  to this man  oh my god  they're so  I'd rather eat  big ass  tongue  oh my god  oh  nothing  you said  that  hey  Jim  it's too thick  no see look  he's gonna leave  don't leave  see he's gonna leave  he's leaving  it's just a

[01:48:30]  it's not nice  Jimmy you got  one of those  things  mine is  vacuums  his is  bananas  ants  air hoses  whatever  you think  I would tell  you  I have one  I would never  tell you  you got one  oh yeah  is it an  innocent thing  kind of  heterosexual  sex  is it an  innocent thing  like the laugh  of a small  child  oh I got  something for  you  thank you  fan  it grows in 
[01:49:00]  bunches  I've got  my hunches  it's the best  beats the rest  cellular modular  interactive modular

[01:50:00]  and now people  think I'm an  idiot  I have another  one but I do  enjoy a good  banana  I like to eat  them  yeah  I know  people too  it's a superfood  it's full of  some vitamin  that I obviously  lack  you never had  a banana  no  that's so weird  all right  we got big  someone offered  me about $500  once to eat  a little bit  and I vomited  well could you  do that for our  radio show next  time you're in  town  that would be  terrific radio  I would need  much more money  than that  would you ever  take a gig  that was when I  was poor  at bananas  in Poughkeepsie 
[01:50:30]  that's a funny  question  would you ever  take a gig  at bananas  in Poughkeepsie  I can handle  the word  yeah  there's big  bananas  hanging  it's fake  oh yeah  they're fake  but they're fake  you can do that  I used to have  one of those  blow up bananas  that you rode in  the pool with  oh really  like a pool pony  but that was cool  with that  oh okay  so you're not  completely insane  it's just actual  bananas  I can't go to  Queensland though  up in Queensland  there's just  banana plantations  everywhere  and I have  like walking  through it  and the trees  like attacking  me  they're not  trees  they're like 
[01:51:00]  bamboo  yeah banana  whatever they are  we got big A  in studio  big A  what are you  growing a beard  you got a  Homer Simpson  thing going  how you been  buddy  wow that beard  covers a lot  of real estate  so you doing  okay  yeah not bad  how is it  without any  eyebrows  we shaved  big A's eyebrows 
[01:51:30]  for the TV  pilot  they're growing  back  already  wow  a little bit  he was late  no  I thought  he always  didn't have  eyebrows  he did  what's wrong  big A  you're not  talkative  today  you're sad  a little bit  I guess  why  why are you  sad  what's wrong  he doesn't  like seeing  me upset  yeah  of course  why you 
[01:52:00]  sad  why  it's me  well it's not  a good thing  to have bad  breath  the scraper  helps though  if you use  the scraper  afterwards  or cleaner  that does  help  it can help  we all have  it sometimes  you don't want  to do the  tongue scraping  bit for us  today  I'll do it  this is  horrible  this is  horrible  we're just  trying to find 
[01:52:30]  where your  line is  let me eat  a banana  or something  we should  start it  if you  eat a  banana  that's  fair  scrape his  tongue  lose his  dignity  I'm not  eating a  bloody  banana  what's the  price of  this man's  soul  I'll tell you  what it's  not a  bloody  banana  if you  were drowning  and the  only way to  reach you  was with a  banana  would you  grab it  what do you  mean the  only way to  reach me  like you're  just out of  hands reach 
[01:53:00]  so you're  saying a  banana  this is gonna  happen is it  the only way to  reach me is  banana you  haven't got an  item of  clothing that you  can chuck off  with your  hand you're  naked you're  only holding a  banana you  couldn't stick  your leg out  instead which  is longer than  your arm but  doesn't have  the  dexterity to  hold a  banana between  his toes  the banana  i love  jeffrey's rules  i would i would  tell you that  that i that  use your leg or  use your shirt  or something like 
[01:53:30]  that or i just  because then i  know even if you  save me then on  the the boat  going back to  the big boat  you'd just be  baiting me with  banana  the whole time  and that would be  uncomfortable  okay who saved  you  who saved you  just have to  jump in the  water again  hey uh big a  uh what's gonna  make this fun  we want you to  be part of the  joke we want you  to be laughing with  us and instead of  us all laughing at  you i know this is  a little rough  how about eric go  smell uh big a's  uh breath 
[01:54:00]  eric has been known  to have really bad  breath as well  yes we've talked  about it and  actually because we  brought it uh to  everyone's attention  it's it's not as  bad these days  eric is going over  to big a i'm sure  it's not that bad  big a could you  just uh do a nice  like uh like  breathe really  just give him a  yeah give him a  oh my god  inhale here we  go right in his  face just go  wow i've never 
[01:54:30]  seen him make  that face before  all right wait  a minute that was  a great face  he just he he  he just freaking  wobbled like he  got hit it did it  looked like a boxer  that just got it  clocked in the head  and got all woozy  yeah yeah that's  you need a standing  eight count  that's gotta help  big a laugh with  hold on i don't  even want to know  eric you didn't do  this properly so now  you gotta take another 
[01:55:00]  one because you know  this is radio  all right give give  eric his own mic  big a instead of  going go  like right but can i  say this anyone any  guy breathing in  another guy's face  isn't nice you're  gonna have a visceral  reaction to like my  breath probably smells  like bananas right  now or coffee it would  probably give you a  similar reaction so  it's not just you any  one of us breathing in  someone's face would  cause a reaction  big a this is gonna  lead to some fine  dental care  mine smells like 
[01:55:30]  scoutmaster  all right  how much does it cost  to get your teeth  clean we should just  get that done over at  xm because we got that  dentist upstairs  yes we'll do it  today we'll get  your teeth clean  yeah 10 grand  well you're on your  own uh one more  time and follow  anthony's  go go  instructions  don't go  don't be embarrassed  we're friends  big long  right into his nose  and eric you have to  visually inhale  yes when he does it 
[01:56:00]  through your nose  ready  and go  big a's about to  vomit  big a you all right  what happened  oh  you shouldn't tell  big a to do a big  breath  could be his last  breath  all right big a  i saw what happened 
[01:56:30]  also  when i see people  throw up  i also  throw up  oh you get a little  sick when you see  people  throw up  where were you  yesterday  yeah right  that would have  been a show  all right  all right so there's  a little bile mixed  in now good  all right eric  what happened  you dropped the  mic and started  puking immediately  did you actually  vomit eric  i threw up in my  hand  you had a bucket  no it wasn't there  yet  um you know like  his eyes are 
[01:57:00]  tearing  you know like when  you go to the gas  station you're  pumping and you  get that gas bubble  inside where you're  constantly just  breathing gasoline  he didn't just  breathe in my face  he forced it down  my throat  he might be an  energy resource we  haven't tapped yet  like if it smells the  same as gasoline  it might actually be  combustible  yeah a harbor  naika  all right so let's  let's get moving on

[02:00:00]  continent yeah but i've done  a lot of countries inside  those continents as well  yeah we're gonna go back to  big a in in a second but i  remember something from  yesterday that i wanted to  bring up really fast kind of  got to keep it short because we  really want to get into this  big a thing sure uh south  america yes you love south  america yes uh no no uh  south africa sorry south  africa's ace yeah you love  south africa love it and they  got some weird thing going on  with uh with aids yes what is  that again one in four people  have aids in south africa right 
[02:00:30]  we understand that yeah but how  how do they cure aids oh i didn't  think okay well there's a there's a  theory in the townships and this  isn't just me talking off the cuff i  heard this from several people  that if you can cure aids by  having sex with a virgin right  they really believe that they  will they will cleanse you through  doing this and uh so a lot of um  there's a lot of rape going on  with virgins involved who then get  aids it's it's not it's not a funny  bit this no i'm not  people get confused with this show 
[02:01:00]  every once in a while we do like to  like get a little serious moment no  no i thought that was amazing well i  hear about south africa i heard this  before i went out there and i thought  oh no this doesn't happen and then  when you speak to people you go no  it's a serious problem and i went to  an aids check myself was out there  because they do it so quickly like in  britain you have to wait like two  weeks there they they bash them out  really fast and it's funny when you  get an aids test in south africa that  they have a person with aids sitting  there while you wait the 10 minutes  for the test to come back who just 
[02:01:30]  sits with you and goes it's not that  bad it's all right oh wow it's because  they're expecting it to just come back  positive yeah they don't want you  killing everybody in the doctor's office  so they're trying to keep you calm  keep you calm unbelievable all right  so uh let's get back to big a uh  irak uh irak's uh our go-to guy when  we really need irak he steps up and  that needs to be known because we  kill him on a daily basis on the show  but when things need to be done irak  is right there he has never said no to

[02:02:30]  to supervise you see he's got the the  tongue scraper that's going to get the  goop off his tongue but then you got to  make sure the sample goes into that  plastic spoon all right and steve it's a  good thing that you're there because  you'll be the first one as punishment  for not having the scraper i feel you  should be the first one to take a little  whiff and then you got to heat up the  spoon inject it no i know that but it  wasn't i thought it wasn't to your  liking when you do it make sure you  stick your tongue right out because the  stuff at the backs the more heinous

[02:13:00]  I wish Dave was here.  He won't cut it.  Come on, Roland.  You have to make up for your naughtiness.  Roland, come on.  I would love to see Bob Kelly in this situation because he would just be...  Oh, dude.  Dude, that was so bad.  Oh, that was so...  Roland, come on, Roland.  Just take one for the team.  We all did it.  Come on, Roland.  Roland.  One whiff.  I don't care. 
[02:13:30]  We're leaving for the weekend after this.  Now make sure you smell it.  Don't fake it.  We can tell.  Then you just got to do it again.  Roland, how are you today?  Smash the spoon.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, Roland.  Close your mouth.  Roland.  No, smell it.  Roland.  You got to smell it, Roland.  We'll hold you down if you don't.  You see his arms?  He just went so gay.  He just looked like a baby.  He put his arms up in the air like...  He was like one of those...  Oh, I'm going to get you. 
[02:14:00]  He shook his arms back and forth.  He did.  He went like...  Oh, my God.  Oh, did you see it, Jimmy?  Yeah, he basically...  You got a good look.  Dan said that Roland had a slight seizure right now.  He just had a slight seizure.  Oh, my God.  I am so nauseated.  Jim, you're up.  Bring over the spoon.  Bring the spoon.  No, no, no, no.  Have him go over to it.  Bring the spoon.  I want that nowhere near me.  All right.  Jim Jeffries, who's playing Carolines, tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday. 
[02:14:30]  A very, very funny call.  212-757-4100.  I do believe he's going to do quite well at Carolines this weekend.  No, no, it's not...  That's...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, I know what it does.  Oh, Jesus.  You get a bit of a burn at the end.  It's like wasabi.  It's when it goes up the end towards the hairs and all that. 
[02:15:00]  It's powerful wasabi.  Go on, Norton.  Have a go.  No, can't do it.  I've done some disgusting things.  I can't do it.  Opie, what do you think?  Do me a favor.  You're going to go in?  All right, get another good scraping.  Get one more good scraping.  I don't know.  Get a good, hard, deep scrape.  Right way back.  Almost choke yourself.  There you go.  Ant, are you going to do it?  Ant?  Are you insane?  Are you a mad person?  That would be the great get.  Look at it sliming off on this moon. 
[02:15:30]  I actually thought it was going to be worse.  Although I do feel kind of ill now.  Yeah.  It's looking like cake batter.  All right, E-Roc, bring it over.  I'll give it a shot.  What the hell?  I've had a worse tongue than that.  I'm not close, Anthony.  Get away from me.  I swear I'll kill.  I will kill.  I'm not doing the mustache thing, though.  No way.  A quick one.  Just a quick one.  I think smelling it.  Wait, wait.  Don't do that.  Can you get disease of smelling it?  I don't think so. 
[02:16:00]  Put it down there.  I just want to look.  Oh, my God.  You're not okay.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Opie.  Hey, Opie.  Tongue scraping mustache.  Come on.  No way.  I don't know if I can do this.  I did it.  Go and do it.  Take a good, deep breath through your nose.  It's not that bad.  It's quite a noise.  Jimmy, if I do it, you do it.  Can't do it.  Come on.  I've done a lot.  How about we do a tag team?  I can't do that.  Can't do it.  Well, Kenny.  Kenny.  Hey, me and Kenny. 
[02:16:30]  I'll throw up horribly.  I already feel nauseous.  Oh, my God.  I can smell from here.  Get a good one.  The only reason I'm doing this is that because you sold 160 tickets in the last half hour.  Wow.  What are we up to?  Yeah.  Another 160 plus.  So, what are we up to?  I don't know.  A sellout is $1,800 for the ONA Animation Festival.  People are slowing down.  Don't disappoint your radio heroes.  Tickets are on sale.  Dude, Fenters, I am Ball Ramone Animation Festival.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  Now, let me smell this.  Hamilton, Brandt, Kornfeld.  Get a good one.  Come on.  I'll be doing it.  Kenny, we're going to do a tag team here.  Ready?  Get it over there.  You've got to get right into it.  The first one didn't really hurt me.  Oh, God.  Want me to go first?  Yeah, you go first.  Yeah, big Kenny.  Nothing phases him.  No, Kenny is really...  He's on the floor. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  He's facing Mecca.  He fell on the floor.  Oh, my God.  Oh, come on.  It wasn't that bad.  Have another go.  It might be better now.  Look at my eyes.  It's not that bad.  His eyes are tearing.  He's crying.  Jimmy, please do this.  He's crying.  Please do this.  Oh, no.  Jimmy's doing it.  Norton, here we go.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Look at him. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, God.  He's backed against the wall.  One of the better reactions, not to try even, but Jimmy, does that, like, look at my eyes.  They're watering.  It assaults you.  I feel sicker now than I did when I smelled it.  It was a few minutes before it settled into my...  It's not...  And what it smells like, it's just bad breath, really.  It's not...  I've smelled...  If this is a prelude to try to get me to do it, it certainly will never work.  I will never...  I can't...  Get away from me.  I swear to you.  I can't explain...  Save this stuff. 
[02:18:30]  Don't throw it out, though.  Save this stuff.  It absolutely smells like bad breath, but there's something else mixed in there.  Yeah, it's a salt.  It assaults you.  It's like a...  It assaults you.  It assaults you like...  Put it in a baggie because Dave's across the way, and maybe Dave needs a mustache and  some money.  Mm-mm.  Okay.  Ugh.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to smell my own tongue to see how bad it is.  Everyone's tongue stinks.  No, man.  I've smelled my own tongue scraping.  It's awful.  My one smells...  Big A, I want to acknowledge it.  It's awful on just about everybody.  Mine smells bad because it's concentrate. 
[02:19:00]  You don't...  Your breath doesn't actually smell like that spoon.  That's like it at its best.  If you will.  Well, that's not good.  I think I popped a effin' blood vessel in my eye.  I will say this.  That was funny.  That was funny when you fell to the ground.  Yeah, keep it all on there.  Oh, God.  Jimmy nailed it.  It assaults you.  Let's put it on anybody.  You're like, it's not that bad, and you get a little closer, and then bam.  What the hell is that, Steve?  Get the...  That looks like something out of CSI. 
[02:19:30]  Get away.  Get away.  Big A, great job.  We'll get you fixed up.  We'll get you to a dentist.  You know, whatever.  It's fine.  It'll be all good.  And we're going to teach you how to shave, too, you're a psychopath.  But we're glad you came in.  You're terrific, as always.  He's a TV star.  They loved you.  Comedy Central loved you.  Never disappoints.  Yeah, we shaved his eyebrows for the pilot that...  We don't know if it's going to get picked up or not, but we did our job.  Jim Jeffries, great comic, man.

We blew off a lot of material to just do tongue scraping for a half hour.  It was worth every delicious whiff.  I want to thank Toucher and Rich for all the support they're giving us up there in Boston.  Listen to them later on today if you're a BCN listener, okay?  And leave stupid Randy Rhoads alone.  Let her do her job.  Ah, yeah, whatever. 
[02:21:00]  And go listen to Shredder Reagan today for all the people in Buffalo.  Hey, Cleveland, what's up?  Haven't talked to you in a while.  All right.  Have a good weekend.  We'll see you guys Monday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202.  In the world of radio shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options. 
[02:21:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:22:00]  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it  feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from  to my  and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio of E-Rock in the bathroom.  They are sick freaks.  Can you pop this?  I want to see something squirt out. 
[02:22:30]  Aim it over there.  This is the worst  show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are.  XM Satellite Radio.  Got a nice little crowd out there.  They're nice.  Three people?  Yeah.  You guys can come by and check out the show. 
[02:23:00]  No problem.  We got the bleachers set up.  You can come any day of the week.  It seems like people decide to come by on Fridays.  Yeah.  Friday's the day.  Maybe they take Fridays off.  But I mean we're here every day  and you can see the show any day you want.  Just come on by.  You wait outside.  What?  Right around quarter to nine?  Something like that?  Yeah.  Something like that.  And then we get you up here.  You sit on the bleachers  and the uncomfortable bleachers  and you watch the show.  They really are uncomfortable.  Like metal.  Fucking aluminum or some shit.  I can't wait to see what Sam does with that video. 
[02:23:30]  It's aluminum.  Aluminum.  Aluminium.  I know.  Aluminium.  Aluminium.  Aluminum.  It's aluminum.  Right?  It's aluminum foil.  Aluminum.  Aluminium foil.  Or as the R's called, tin foil.  Tin foil.  We call it tin foil.  Yeah, we call it tin foil.  Oh, do you?  Hey, instant feedback.  A lot of people thought the tongue scraping was amazing  and a lot of people had to actually punch out.  Had to turn it off.  I'm from the school of it's just hilarious 
[02:24:00]  and I have to hang in there until the end.  No, too disgusting.  A bunch of people over at the other joint  said they had to kind of leave studios  and leave the radio for a while.  That just got over the top disgusting.  I can't wait to see the video samples together.  It's going to be terrific.  I don't know what's going on  with our O&A Animation Festival tickets.  We try so hard to put an event together  where we're not taking money out of your pockets.  We try to keep it cheap or free  and we just never could accomplish that. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, I'm hearing all sorts of disgusting things  with the service charges, the shipping charges,  the venues, the venue fee, this and that.  I mean, we wanted a $10 ticket.  We knew there would be some kind of charge.  Yeah.  But now I'm hearing people like are spending $20, $25  for a ticket, even higher than that,  close to $30 a ticket  after they add in all these other charges.  And it's not because we jacked the price up  at the last minute or did anything.  It's still what amounts to a $10 ticket.  But in this day and age, 
[02:25:00]  they put service charges  and so much bullshit on top of everything.  Do you reckon there'll be scalpers for this gig?  Yeah, there'll be that.  Is Bob Kelly naked on Pal Talk?  Oh, God.  What is he doing?  It is.  That's Bob Kelly.  Bob, what is he doing?  That really is him.  God, for a fat man,  he's got like solid pecs, though.  How did he get that done?  He does.  He's quite solid, isn't he?  Bobby.  He's listening to the show, obviously.  Fucking. 
[02:25:30]  That's got to be the weirdest thing ever.  Lick your nipple, Bobby.  Try to lick your nipple.  Bobby's a fat.  He's still fat,  but he's got like well-defined pecs.  Like bullets.  Ah, he's licking his fingers  and rubbing his nipple.  He's got nice biceps as well.  The whole package is sort of doable.  Huh.  All right.  And it's the fag hanging out of the mouth as well.  Which makes it a little better.  Somebody,  Crisco,  she's a reliable source from Whack Bag.  She writes,  I just spent $88 on four $10 tickets.  It's fucking,  it's revolting. 
[02:26:00]  The fucking Ticketmaster charges.  Four $10 tickets cost $88.  Shipping and handling.  That's $22 per ticket.  Trust me.  I just want to say something to,  Bobby,  hey, Bobby, you cunt,  why did you tell him about the banana thing?  Oh, it was Bob Kelly that did,  Yeah, he told somebody.  He's the one he knew.  He's the one he knew.  Look at him.  He's just laughing at me.  Why don't we get Bob Kelly on the phone?  We're trying.  All right, we're trying to get Bob Kelly.  Bob, you know the number.  Why don't you just give us a call, please?  He's smoking.  He's topless.  He's tweaking his nipples.  What the fuck?  I like the artwork in his house. 
[02:26:30]  He's drinking Gatorade?  Drinking Gatorade.  Drink,  drink,  drink Gatorade rain.  Less calories.  Starbucks.  Two Starbucks coffees.  Very nice.  And why is King Kong Bundy on television?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, hey,  I just got another  another communique  about the ONA Animation Festival.  The prize money at this point  is up to $10,000.  Wow.  That we're going to distribute  between first, second, and third place.  Nice.  So first place will be 
[02:27:00]  at least $5,000.  Whoever wins the ONA Animation Festival  will win at least $5,000.  Five Gs.  And then we got another 5 Gs  for second and third.  A Gs.  And that might even go up.  Or we might throw other things  into this thing.  So we need the animators.  We're getting a little nervous.  We know there's some animators  out there working on stuff,  but maybe you could start  maybe helping us hype this event.  Maybe you call up with your animations  and explain what you're doing.  I don't know.  Because we've got to make sure  we have some fine,  fine animations for this thing.  Yeah.  And we need you guys 
[02:27:30]  to mail in your animations  to Opie and Anthony Animation Contest.  111 West 57th Street, Suite 500,  New York, New York, 10019.  All this info is up on opieandanthony.com.  But this event is going to rock.  We're thinking of maybe getting  Jim Jeffries to do  20, 30 minutes of comedy  at the day.  Hey, why not?  I will.  I must fly out for it.  Who knows?  We're definitely going to get  like two comedians  just to break it up a little bit.  A bunch of animations up front,  a couple of comedians,  more animations,  and then maybe the final three  and then announce the winner  and bam, everyone goes home. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, has opieandthony.com  sent out like a mass mailing and stuff?  For what?  Just this whole idea of this.  Oh, I don't know.  To get your tickets and stuff?  Yeah, and also  for the animation.  I don't know,  for the animation themselves.  Yeah, we'll, I'm sure.  Yeah, thumbs up.  Yeah, yeah.  Thumbs up.  Good.  Thumbs up on that.  We're doing everything we can  to market the hell out of this.  We really want this to be  one of these events  that we're proud of  that we could bring  to the people every year.  Huge.  There's a lot of fun  in the crowd. 
[02:28:30]  Absolutely.  All right.  Want to get into  some other things today?  Sure.  We have the Seinfeld  Car Crash 9-11 call.  9-11?  9-1-1 call.  We got the pregnant man  on Oprah.  Car crashes?  What are they about?  I'm wondering.  You know when you're in your car  and you smash into something.  I don't understand  what happened.  You're on your phone.  We have to back up  and say hi to Bob Kelly.  Bob.  Oh, Bobby.  Hey, what's up, man?  Where are you? 
[02:29:00]  What are you doing?  I'm in West Palm.  I just got done  doing my morning radio zoo.  What show did you do?  I don't know.  What was the name of the show?  Two guys and a girl.  And a cup.  Did you do Loper and Schmitty?  Uh, I don't know.  Did you do, uh...  Huh?  I'm doing one this afternoon, too.  No, what morning show  did you do?  Um, hang on.  Let me see if I have  a piece of paper.  I have no idea.  I just go in and do them.  One was a husband and wife. 
[02:29:30]  Husband and wife theme?  A real one?  Wow.  Kevin and Virginia?  Yeah, real husband and wife.  Cunt and pussy whipped.  Why would you do a radio show  with your wife?  I don't know.  There's a TV show in Britain  called Richard and Judy.  Hey, guy.  How are ya?  Jeffrey Ross entering the studio.  Hi, Jeff.  And, um, Bobby.  What's up?  I, uh, I got your DVD slash CD.  Oh, you got it?  I got an advanced copy.  It looks great.  I can't wait to actually watch it,  but the packaging looks good.  Oh, cool.  Did you know I tried to rip it up 
[02:30:00]  and throw it down a flight of stairs yet?  No, man.  No, no, from there.  We don't mess with that crap.  When does it come out?  Tuesday?  Uh, CD comes out Tuesday in stores, yeah.  The special's on tonight.  Yeah, the Comedy Central special's  tonight with Bob Kelly.  Next Tuesday, his DVD slash CD comes out.  Uh, just the tip, right?  Yeah, just the tip.  And there's a bunch of videos  on ComedyCenter.com,  including one with, uh,  Jim Norton,  Louis C.K.,  Patrice,  and Colin,  where they just literally  ripped me apart.  Very nice.  Now, uh, Bob, 
[02:30:30]  I hate to admit this,  but, um,  for, like,  kind of a chubby guy,  I can't even really call you fat anymore  because you are starting to lose weight.  For a chubby guy,  you got well-defined pecs.  What's that about?  I've been working out.  Look at that.  Look at that.  I don't want to look that close, but...  And then Jim Jeffries  noticed that you have nice biceps.  Look at these biceps.  He's all man, the Kelly.  The Kelly.  Look at that.  The Kelly's all man.  Why is he there shirtless, though?  No, I'm telling you,  he's a,  you're a bear.  You're a bear.  In the gay world, 
[02:31:00]  you're a big bear.  You know,  you call him out over here?  Yes.  The big fat guys are bears.  Bears and twinks?  No.  We did this whole bit.  What was it again?  Twinks.  Twinks and...  I'm a sloppy bottom.  You're a sloppy party bottom.  Bobby.  I'm a sloppy party bottom bear twink.  Bobby,  you were just getting to know  this Jim Jeffries character,  and you gave us  the greatest thing indirectly.  We learned today  that he's deathly afraid of bananas.  I've got that secret  for a long time.  He's like a monk.  But how did you find out  that he's scared of bananas? 
[02:31:30]  I was eating a banana,  and I came near him,  and he flipped out  like I raped him  in high school.  Were you ever a scout?  Scout master?  Yeah,  we can tell the story over here.  We also learned  that Jim Jeffries  got the shit beat out of him  by his mom  because he wouldn't go  to scouts anymore  because...  The scout master  used to put me in a corner  and call me names  and wank on my face.  What have I walked into? 
[02:32:00]  Bobby Kelly's naked.  That was it, really.  As I said,  it wasn't that bad.  You know,  it wasn't great.  Did he cum on your face?  He used to wank on me,  yeah.  What would he call you?  What kind of names?  No,  it was just calling me  a fucking bad boy  and shit like that.  It wasn't like names as such.  It wasn't like...  Did you look at it?  Like,  would you look at it a little bit?  No,  it was a little bit  keep looking at my eyes  and stuff.  The same things  I make grown people do now.  Did he,  did he,  like,  like,  would it go in your mouth? 
[02:32:30]  A little bit, right?  No,  a little bit,  a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh,  gosh.  All I'm saying is that  being,  I think some people  get molested  and some people  get molested.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I was on the lower scale.  It wasn't,  you know,  I walked away from it.  You walked okay?  I walked okay.  I,  I,  I enjoyed everything else  to do with scouts.  I could still tie  a good bow shake  and,  it was just bow like it.  And he's kind of like 
[02:33:00]  taking the military approach.  A lot of our boys  go over there  to the Middle East,  Iraq and all that  and they come back okay  and others,  they're,  they're shell shocked.  Shell shocked.  Most traumatic stress.  I think I'm okay,  but yesterday we're talking  about me felching  people's assholes out  and saying that  that's an okay activity.  Yeah.  And so there's a few issues  that are underlying here,  but he still lives  a couple of streets  up from his parents.  Why don't you  beat the shit out of him?  Well,  he went to prison  for a while  and you know,  I,  I,  I hate ex-girlfriends, 
[02:33:30]  but I don't go around  and hit them.  They're paying for it.  You suck it.  And he's an old man now.  He's an old man.  Yeah,  but that's good.  You could go in like,  uh,  uh,  Simon Wiesenthal  with an old Nazi  or something  and just kind of,  you know,  attack him.  So Bobby,  I actually,  I actually blew a guy  for a steak  when I was in,  uh,  first grade,  so that's not bad.  For a steak?  Like,  a bit of meat?  He took a T-bone steak  on his,  uh,  roof and he,  uh,  made me go in the closet  and put it in my mouth.  Just so you could have  the steak? 
[02:34:00]  He must really like steak.  It was a nice T-bone steak.  Yeah,  look at him.  He's a big boy.  You took a bone  for a T-bone.  Hey,  Bobby,  so,  um,  yeah,  so this was going on  at Scout,  so he goes home  and he decides,  you know what,  I don't feel like  being molested anymore,  so he stopped  going to Scout,  so then his mom  got pissed  that he wasn't  going to Scouts  and beat the shit  out of him.  With the Scout belt.  With the Scout belt.  With the Scout belt.  You see the buckles  on those things?  They're massive.  She clubbed me to hell  with the Scout belt.  Did you ever tell your mom?  And I had a little chunk  in the back of my head 
[02:34:30]  that was bleeding  and so she had to  take me into the hospital,  right?  And I go into the hospital  and my mom's sitting  there with me  and they go,  so James,  how did this happen?  And I went,  well,  mom told me not  to ride me bike  so fast down the hill.  Like,  I couldn't go there  with all the things.  Oh,  you couldn't rat her out?  Yeah,  yeah,  I couldn't rat her out  because,  you know,  I could be putting  some foster care home  where I'll get molested  and beaten with a belt  which would have been,  you know,  involved packing  which I didn't want  to get into.  That would have been  the only difference  from the situation  I was already in. 
[02:35:00]  I was a suitcase  away from that.  Unbelievable.  Did you ever tell your mom?  No,  I told my parents  the guy went to prison  for eight months.  Because of what he did  to you?  You don't have to testify?  me and a couple,  no,  no,  it was,  he pleaded guilty  and done deal.  It was me and a couple  other guys  and then he just moved  back into the neighborhood  and I hear he's  back at scouts.  No,  I don't know.  Oh,  yeah,  right.  I'm sure he's been  banned from that institution.  Oh,  did he make you  open your mouth  and like...  No,  there wasn't,  there was always  a bit of shame  with him 
[02:35:30]  while he was doing it.  He was always  regretting it  as he went along.  Oh,  I'm horrible.  But his kid  went to our school.  Oh,  boy.  Because,  you know,  the Scoutmasters  are always a father  of one of the kids  so his kid  was a kid we knew  and so then  he gets put down  for,  he gets put into prison  for a couple of kids  at our school.  That kid had a hard time.  The amount of times  we held him down  and wanked on his face  was unbelievable.  Oh,  that would have been  some justice.  Do you have like  seagulls,  like the tricks 
[02:36:00]  where you're like  wet willies  where you stick your finger  in someone's ear.  Do you have the seagull?  What's the seagull?  The seagull is this thing  sweeping Britain  which when I was a kid  no one admitted to masturbating,  right?  No one ever talked about it.  You got to about 16  before you told one bloke  or something, right?  Are you kidding?  That's different than in America.  You know,  you wanted to share  with other...  No,  no,  no,  I was denying it for years.  I wanted to share  your knowledge  with other guys  like,  dude,  did you realize  you wanted to share  that knowledge?  No,  no,  not in Australia.  No,  no,  no.  So there's this thing  called seagulling now  where what you do 
[02:36:30]  is you go into the toilet,  wank on your hand  and then you wait  for a kid to pass by,  smash it against his face  and go seagull  like a seagull  shouting at him.  That's where they've gone  from wet willies  to smashing cum  on another kid's head.  What's the odds  that you have  two bald guys  that actually suck cock  in the studio  at one time?  What's that?  I said,  what...  I'm not doing that.  What have I walked into? 
[02:37:00]  Bobby Kelly's naked,  everybody's jerking off  on each other's faces?  I never got a seagull  but my friend Dean,  me and my friend Neil  were at his house  when we were like  fucking 12  and Dean was in the bathroom  for a long time  and Dean came out  and we didn't know  what he had in his hand  and he goes,  he goes to Neil,  you've been given head  and he wiped his load  in his hand  across Neil's mouth  and he tried to wipe it  on my face  by his glasses back then  and it swooped  on my glasses  and pulled up  like in the bottom 
[02:37:30]  half of the glasses  because he touched my skin.  How much jizz  did this guy have  in his hand?  He was a young man.  There is something horny  about getting sucked off  by a girl with glasses  and when they come  there's something about that  that I have.  Oh yeah, yeah.  It's called humiliation  which you're used to.  Bad boy,  look me in the eyes.  Open your mouth  just a bit now.  Open your mouth  just a bit.  My mother read reviews  of me doing material  about that on stage  and she goes,  why do you have to  disgrace the family  all the time?  You hit me with a fucking  belt while I was being  molested.  She's there going,  yes, but I didn't know. 
[02:38:00]  Tell her to stop  disgracing the family  and lose some weight.  Yeah, well,  I'm just glad to...  Oh, poor mum.  Sorry.  She's never left  the block of land  that we live on  by foot.  Really?  No, never.  She's been there  for like 35 years.  She's never left  by foot.  Once there was  like a soccer game  that I was playing  in as a kid  that was up the road,  the soccer field  was so close  to where I live  people were parking  out the front of our house.  My mum just circled 
[02:38:30]  the block  until she got  slightly closer.  So she didn't walk  off your property?  Ever.  Never.  She never set foot  off the block  of land we grew up on.  She's probably afraid  of being stranded.  Yeah.  And not being able  to walk back.  Hey, Jeff Jeffries,  did you tell them  the story about your girl  when the house  got broken into?  Yeah, we told that  last time, didn't we?  You know what?  We have a lot of new listeners  since the last time  we were here.  I wouldn't mind  hearing that story again.  It's quite horrific.  I can't even remember  where the jokes were in it.  What did I tell you earlier? 
[02:39:00]  Sometimes it's about  just telling an interesting story.  I was...  We're getting a tidbit out there.  I was at home  in Manchester  with my mate  watching a movie  and my girlfriend  was next door  asleep in the bedroom.  Me and my mate  were stoned  watching Unforgiven,  I think.  And at four in the morning  two guys came through  the window,  one with a machete  and one with a hammer.  And they tied me up  and there's a scar there  on the side of my head  where they cut my head  and they put a shoe bag  over my face  and all the blood 
[02:39:30]  rushed out  into the front of the bag  and then they threatened  to rape my girlfriend  while I was tied up  on the ground.  And it was good,  I got a good lot  of material out of it.  This is the weird thing,  right?  So they got me  on the ground,  I got these pictures  and stuff  on my chest of drawers  of all my nephews  and nieces  and the nice one  out of the two,  right?  He's a good guy,  the other guy  was a bit of a prick.  And he pulls up  a picture  and goes,  either of you guys  got kids?  And my mate Steve's  on the ground  like this  and he goes,  I got a five-year-old boy  like that, 
[02:40:00]  right?  So I think,  fucking hell,  you don't have kids,  they're going to fucking  kill me now,  right?  They're going to fucking  kill me.  So I go,  I got a four-year-old girl,  right?  And my mate tries  to top me by going,  my one's retarded.  How's that going to help?  You're not going to kill  the guy with the retarded  kid,  he needs all the loving.  Yeah,  that retarded kid  needs all the help  he can get.  Why did they come  through your window?  Were they looking for drugs?  Were you guys  known to have drugs in the house? 
[02:40:30]  No,  they thought we were  drug dealers  because being comics,  we had a fair bit of cash,  I drove a nice car  and I didn't seem  to go to work  and when I did go to work  it was for like two days.  But I didn't,  if you knocked on my door  at three in the afternoon,  I'd answer in my underwear  eating a bowl of cereal.  And that's drug dealer behavior.  Why did you leave  the window open?  Because we were in the house  and it was hot.  It was the middle of summer.  It was a nice neighborhood.  It was an alright neighborhood  but they came through  actually the second story  window at the bathroom.  Why was that window  left open? 
[02:41:00]  Because you shit in the bathroom  and it smells bad  so you open a window.  You're batting down  the hatches.  But we were in the house.  Robert Kelly's acting  like a girl.  Oh God,  he's doing the talk.  What is wrong with you?  What has happened here today?  What the hell, Bob?  Bobby Kelly's on Pal Talk  doing the talk  and it looks like  he's wearing  flesh panties.  Oh my God,  it's like  his cock's gone down  one side.  It's like just one big flap 
[02:41:30]  on the side of his cane.  Oh God.  Yeah, show his fly's eyes.  Kenny, cancel our bagel sandwich.  And now he's vomiting.  Oh, he just held open  the crack of his ass  and there was like  a fucking  big hair hanging out.  What is wrong with you, Bob?  Bobby's just  fucking lost his mind.  I was telling  a heartfelt story  about my robbery  and Bobby goes,  I'll put my cock  between my legs  so it looks like  I got a cunt.  Yeah.  He looked like  you had a bunch.  Good job. 
[02:42:00]  A man-gina for you guys.  Yeah, thank you, Bob.  A man-gina.  That's what this show  needed today.  Oh, gosh.  So, Jim, how did this end?  They got 12 years in prison  which they'll be out  probably in six  or something like that.  They pleaded innocent  even though they were  wearing balaclavas  in the middle of June.  Like, they were driving  in my car  with a whole bootload  of shit.  They go,  no, we weren't there.  We just found this car  and got in it.  Yeah.  And they went to one of them  and they go,  why are you wearing 
[02:42:30]  balaclavas?  And he's like,  it's me style.  That was his excuse.  My mate Steve,  this is the line he said,  this is what happened, right?  My mate Steve used to be  the drummer for Pi Mortal  and he was the relief drummer  for Faith No More  when they came out to Australia.  So, he's like a heavy metal guy, right?  And they came through the window  and he said to me,  he goes,  look, I think you've chosen  the wrong house.  All I have in this house  are 20,000 heavy metal records  and I assume you like hip-hop.  Right?  It was just the most...  Oh, shit.  That didn't help the situation at all. 
[02:43:00]  Nah, I can imagine it wouldn't.  Did they leave the girl alone?  I don't remember.  Yeah, they held a knife to the throne  threatened to rape her a few times  and then they didn't.  But the funny thing was  when I was getting tied up,  I thought to myself,  I thought,  fuck,  they're going to tie everyone up.  So, while they were doing it,  I kept on acting like  it was hurting my wrists  so that they'd do it loosely.  So, when they tied everyone up,  I could escape  and do some ninja shit  and sort everything out.  But then they just held me hostage  so they didn't tie anyone else up.  So, but she was alright. 
[02:43:30]  But I was tied up  with the fucking cord  from my girlfriend's hair straightener.  The power cord, right?  And when they left,  my mate went and got a knife  and cut me free  and the girl,  she didn't cry  when they had a machete to her throat  so they were going to rape her.  But then I turn around  and she's holding up the power cord  just bawling her eyes out.  That her fucking hair straightener.  Yeah, going,  you can only buy this brand in America.  When am I going to America again?  I can't even fucking get them.  Wow.  Are you crying about your hair straightener?  I'm still bleeding from the head. 
[02:44:00]  Holy shit.  She's the one who's listening.  Was this England or Australia?  This is England.  This is Manchester.  Yeah.  Jim, this is Anthony's worst nightmare.  You know what I mean?  This is why Anthony has all his guns.  Well, I exercised my Second Amendment right  again yesterday, by the way.  I have a brand new weapon.  What is it?  Very happy.  I have a Sig P220  .45 caliber pistol  Oh shit, he's going to be carrying that. 
[02:44:30]  That is a beautiful little weapon.  But what's the use of having it?  In my situation, even if I had a gun,  they just came through the door bang, knife.  Uh-huh.  Would you carry it with you all the time?  Yes, exactly.  You carry it with you all the fucking time.  That's what you do.  Around your house, you're rocking around with a gun.  Why wouldn't you walk around with a gun in your house?  I get so depressed.  If I had a gun with me all the time,  I would have killed myself 50 times already.  Just at the lowest moment,  I would just go boom.  Would you really?  I really would be dead now if I owned a gun. 
[02:45:00]  Well, then you're probably sitting on one.  You know, I'm not a cutter or anything,  but I could definitely go a bullet.  Really?  Oh!  Yesterday, at about 2 o'clock,  feeling a bit down.  Oh my God.  Oh, feeling a bit down.  You couldn't decide what I wanted for lunch.  It would have been all over.  No, I really would be dead if I owned a gun.  Really?  Yeah, not a shadow of a doubt.  If I owned a gun,  if I had a gun with me at any time,  I'd be dead,  or would have killed a couple of people in a race.  Wow, okay, yeah,  then you shouldn't have a gun.  That's why I think it's bad.  It's bad to have guns.  No, it's good to have guns.  Anthony, you don't think you're taunting lunatics right now? 
[02:45:30]  I'm not taunting lunatics.  What are they going to do?  If a lunatic's a lunatic,  he's going to do something bad.  I'm not taunting anybody.  I am a card-carrying member  of the National Rifle Association.  You're a gun-carrying member  of the National Rifle Association.  Yeah, I'm a gun-carrying member.  Do you have a gun on you right now?  No.  Then what's your policy  and carry it with you all the time?  He just got it.  I have Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, but he has other guns.  That's not his first...  He's like fucking Elvis.  He's got other guns. 
[02:46:00]  I have Club Soda Kenny.  I went through...  He's my security guy.  I got a tour of Anthony's house  about two or three weeks ago.  I was amazed at...  I lost count...  What did I say?  It's like Billy out of...  I think I lost count at around eight.  I like guns.  They're fun.  Eight guns in his house.  How was his house?  That's the gun I just got.  Guns and TVs.  Guns and flat screens.  That's what Ian asked.  Have you ever held a gun up to a person?  Mm-mm.  In rage?  No.  For fun he has, though.  No, no.  Have you ever played around in bed with it? 
[02:46:30]  No, no.  Never played in bed.  Have you ever taken my guns in bed?  I've cleaned my guns in bed.  Anthony...  That was just before my girlfriend left me.  Wow.  I hope you don't shoot your guns in real life  like you do in Call of Duty 4  because you stink.  All right, smartass.  I know.  I stink at that game.  Have you ever wanked with a gun in your mouth?  Mm.  No.  Cock.  But never a gun.  No, I don't find guns, you know, like that. 
[02:47:00]  But you just looked at that gun and said,  isn't it sexy?  It's a pretty gun.  Isn't it a pretty gun?  Look at it.  Doesn't that look like something you just want to have on you  all the time?  That's what you got?  Yeah.  That looks cool.  Isn't that cool?  It looks like it's a fun thing to hold.  Yeah, it is.  It's very good.  Can you bring it in and we all get to hold it?  Something I...  No, I can't bring it in.  How many bullets does that thing hold?  How many can you chuck out?  You put about eight in there.  Yeah.  What are you allowed to do?  Are you allowed to take it out of the house?  No.  Yeah.  What's the law?  When are you allowed to shoot a person?  You have to be in danger of your life 
[02:47:30]  or you have to feel like you're in danger of your life being taken.  What political disagreements?  I could have shot those guys in my house.  Or political disagreements.  Yes.  Yeah, you absolutely could have shot those guys in your house.  See, the thing is, if I shot someone in my house in England  in that situation, I'd be in prison right now.  There's deadly physical force laws.  No, you can't.  It doesn't matter.  Really?  Are you shitting me?  If you're in fucking England and people break into your house  and you kill them, you're fucked? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, you're fucked.  You're supposed to just take the shit?  Fuck England.  You've got to blow a whistle.  You can restrain them until the cops get there with their batons.  It's just a stupid fucking country.  That is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.  But the cops really have guns in England, right?  Some of them do.  Yeah, I always find it weird.  The bobbies don't know.  They've got their weird hats and that's scary.  Oh my God, I couldn't imagine that.  No, you just need a gun on you.  Somebody broke into my hotel room one time and I was sleeping. 
[02:48:30]  If I had shot him...  Where?  Tempe.  That sounds justifiable.  What?  What happened to Jeffrey Ross now?  Jeff had a knife pulled on him on stage, didn't you?  Oh yeah, that's true, Bobby.  That's true.  I was actually in Brooklyn.  Oh yeah, that was a different time.  Oh really?  Oh yeah, Bobby, another time too.  Holy shit, I'm an instigator.  Obviously.  What happened in Tempe?  Tempe, I was at this hotel.  What's it called?  Shit. 
[02:49:00]  Anyway, I'm sleeping.  It's a hotel.  I've got to get up at 6 in the morning.  A good hotel or like a shitty motel?  Nice hotel.  Oh wow.  Second floor balcony.  So a guy climbed up.  Oh.  And there had been like rapes and murders for a month.  Oh great.  Going out in Tempe.  That's fantastic.  That's a nice cool breeze and about 4.30 in the morning, I hear the door, the balcony  door start to open.  Holy shit.  Oh shit.  I wish I heard it.  I'm naked.  I'm half asleep because I've got to get up in an hour for radio. 
[02:49:30]  And I go, get the fuck out of here.  And the guy just, I see the hand quiver.  The hand is now six feet from my head.  Oof.  And he goes, uh, uh, uh, security, sorry.  And I hear him fucking run.  And they caught him on video camera climbing over the wall.  Really?  Yeah.  Wait, what did he have in his hand?  A knife or a gun?  Nothing.  He's just coming to steal your cash, wasn't he?  He just wanted to, thought you'd still be sleeping.  I think he was coming to rape some chick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were the wrong guy.  But he heard the fucking voice. 
[02:50:00]  He got a Chucky Jew and he called it off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It probably sounded like you were awake and fuck, he didn't know.  Bobby, I should have played your new CD and scared him off.  No, come on and choke.  Ross, I have the exact same story.  I've told it a million times in Buffalo.  But it's the guys on the street taking a nap during the day.  And I wake up because I feel a presence in the room.  And there's a black guy in a hoodie pulled down tight inches from my face.  And I just open my eyes.  And I just go, what are you doing here?  And I was like, as I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do, I'm like, holy shit. 
[02:50:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  He got up real fast and ran.  And there was a rapist loose in Buffalo at the time.  And he was checking it out to see if I was a girl, I think.  As soon as he heard the man voice.  And what decision did he make?  Oh, you're a man.  No, he ran.  One time when I looked down at 300...  It's the fuck out of me, though.  It is terrifying.  I can't live on a...  I live on like a top floor now apartment in London.  I don't live...  I wouldn't live on the ground.  I'm super careful now.  300 Mercer, when I first moved to New York, I just... 
[02:51:00]  I went down to get my laundry.  And I was downstairs for five minutes.  I'm pretty sure I locked the door.  But it doesn't matter because he probably picked it.  And I opened the door.  And I walk in.  And there's just this crackhead in my bedroom.  And he's like quivering like a deer.  Holy crap.  And I look at him.  And he looks at me.  And it's just like, we both know what's happening.  And he's like, where's Dave?  I'm supposed to play soccer with Dave.  He's out that window, you motherfucker.  And I back off.  And I let him run out.  And he takes the steps. 
[02:51:30]  And I take the elevator.  And I beat him.  And me and the doorman trapped him in the revolving door for 20 minutes.  He just sat in the revolving door banging on it.  A rat trap.  Like catching a fly under a plastic cup.  So finally, the cops, we drag him back in.  And they take him in.  And he's like, obviously, he had AIDS and stuff.  He was a drug addict.  And I go back up the stairs.  And I find like a broken watch in my tape recorder with like my act on it from the night before.  Like he just stole whatever was right there.  And then like six months later, I was in Union Square. 
[02:52:00]  And I saw him just peeling through the intersection.  Like they eventually let him out.  I never pressed charges, I don't think.  And then he just ran.  I saw him robbing somebody else.  Unbelievable.  Oh, monsters.  He's squashing a bug.  There's monsters out there.  Monsters.  Did you hear this, Jim Jefferies?  I know much.  Ants well armed.  Maybe they got it right in England.  They'll have to worry about it as a fucking scout master.  A machete?  No, that's a straight.  Please, they're all whack off for 10 minutes.  I'll tell you what.  The crime in Australia is very low for things like house burglary and stuff like that. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah?  It's much worse in Britain.  They'll have guns in Australia.  No, you're not allowed to have it.  Everyone's got a kangaroo guard.  Yeah, you're not allowed to have a gun.  But the cops can't.  You've got a cute koala bear looking out for you.  Yeah, they've got like stingrays in Australia and things of that nature.  Stingray, that's Steve Irwin.  He fucked with that stingray.  There's no way in the world that cunt was just going and giving it a bit of a pat.  I'm with you.  There's like three people have died from stingray attacks in like the last 50 years.  And the last guy was a guy in New Zealand who was a fisherman who caught a whole lot 
[02:53:00]  of fish in a net.  There was a stingray on top of the fucking fish.  So he picks up the stingray to chuck it overboard.  So he's physically holding the thing.  It stabs him through the heart, right?  You can't.  I've swum with stingrays.  They don't fucking come near you.  They let you pat them at all the fucking stingrays.  You've got to hold them and stuff and wrestle with them.  And he's got fucking, he's got what's coming to him, I reckon.  You think a stingray knows where the heart is or it's just random?  It just randomly.  It doesn't know where the heart is.  Yeah, how many people have been stabbed in other places where they lived?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  By a stingray.  You heard about the latest ray story, right? 
[02:53:30]  It wasn't a stingray, but the greatest ray story happened a mere two weeks ago.  Some ladies in a boat in Florida, Marathon, Florida, and they're tooling along at a nice  clip.  And one of these rays that jumps out of the water decides to jump at that time and smack  her in the face.  Hit her right in the face.  And kills her instantly.  I think it was 75 pounds or something.  And just smacked her right in the head, killed her instantly.  A sea monster jumps out of the water and kills her, basically.  A six foot wingspan, I think, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Massive.  Yeah, right, right.  Massive water bat happens to jump out of the water as the boat's going by. 
[02:54:00]  Can you imagine the odds?  And this thing hits her square in the face.  Pretty much just about takes her head off.  But that's just unfortunate.  That just happens.  So can you keep a stingray in your apartment in London to protect yourself?  Yeah.  Just hold him up and throw his tail at the assailant.  If someone breaks in, you have to lure them into the tub where the stingray is.  Well, in Australia, let's say they have like three or four shark deaths a year, like great  whites.  Now, great whites are like an endangered species. 
[02:54:30]  You can't just, you know, go kill a great white shark.  But if somebody gets killed by one, they pull out like a bounty on its head.  The government go, oh, let's search and find this shark and kill it.  But anyone can do it.  You don't have to be like a professional shark.  So you get a whole lot of fucking cowboys with harpoon guns.  Well, it's the famous scene from Jaws.  Just killing whatever shark they feel like killing.  Yeah.

Oh, it's the same shit.  Jersey, New York.  I want to put a bounty on Kenny's head.  The first person to slap Kenny in the face with a cum hand.  Seagull in.  Wins a big decision.  Kenny, do you remember when you met me in 1991?  Do you remember?  I remember it very vividly.  What happened, Ross?  I'm in Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  I'm opening for Ray Romano, who was a prop act still at the time. 
[02:57:00]  Was Ray Romano a prop act?  Yeah.  He was an actual prop act?  Yeah.  No.  Well, he did a stand-up, and then the last 10 minutes, he did a couple props.  He put a rubber band on his hair, and it went up like a volcano.  That was him?  He had kids.  He was trying to headline, and he didn't have the material, so he had like 10 minutes of  shit at the end.  Wow.  So anyway, this is like 1990.  Hey, guys, I have Colin Quinn on the phone.  Oh, great.  Jeez, nice interruption.  Hi, Colin. 
[02:57:30]  What's happening, guys?  How are you, Colin?  Oh, I'm grand.  Grand.  I can't believe I'm on this show.  I talk about modern technology.  This is ridiculous.  Did Bob Kelly wake you up?  No, actually, I'm awake.  Why up so early?  Alive and kicking.  I was just calling him to see if maybe he fell back asleep after his morning radio so  we could wake him up, you know?  Why help each other get over those crazy times on the road?  Oh, you know, Colin's tired from pushing Jerry's porch down the road the other night. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, Colin, you talked to Jerry Seinfeld about that accident?  Yeah, but then a night later, his Porsche died and I had to give him the old jump start.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Yeah, but his Porsche died on Minetta Way and he had Colin push his one of 38 Porsches  down the side street to get it started.  To have to bump start it, yeah.  What the fuck is Jerry owning like a bunch of shitty cars? 
[02:58:30]  The brakes fail, the thing doesn't start?  Bought a bunch of lemons.  Yeah.  Now, come on.  I heard you guys talking about the old, yesterday on the show, the old days, the Jimmy Jackson  days.  You know?  Colin, you remember, Colin remembers when I was going to go.  You know, one of those, like Anthony's, you know, Grape to Wrath family that moved  out to the West Coast.  Grape to Wrath.  Those are fine cars.  By the way, when I heard Patrice on yesterday philosophically rambling, I literally was spitting 
[02:59:00]  my teeth out of my mouth.  I really had it with his, yeah, you know, it's funny.  He's like musing him in North.  What really got you about that whole thing?  What really got you, here's a guess in general.  I think Bob is guilty of it too, probably, but I can't remember offhand.  And in the past two years, I've heard both Patrice and Norton experts go, that was good  radio. 
[02:59:30]  As opposed to this.  That was good radio, fucking people.  Hey, you want to read?  That was good radio.  Shut the fuck up.  What do you know about good radio, you phony little fake half radio guys?  Not a lot.  We put you on.  No, it's too, same joke in two minutes.  Oh my gosh.  Hey.  Well delivered too, sitcom.  Sitcom?  Hold on, another thing you know nothing about.  I love it for you.  I'd give it a stronger line for the out on that, would you?  Why?  I thought it was pretty good, Morty. 
[03:00:00]  I don't know.  Hey, Jimmy, you got the Esther letter still?  Oh, no, it's over at CBS.  Oh, fuck.  What did she call him?  There was a woman named Esther who writes that sometimes, and she was critiquing your  appearance in the Sarah Silverman biography, and she was noticing...  My appearance?  Yeah.  She critiqued...  You like my outreach?  Yeah, I know.  My appearance?  She critiqued the fact that you've put on a few metric tons.  A few LBs. 
[03:00:30]  Well, you can't sue her for slander, that's for sure.  That's funny.  That's good radio.  I came on, it's so much livelier than when Bob was on, and he actually seriously pushed  me in this conversation.  Bob fucking...  Bob was getting so ignored, he fucking turned around and opened his asshole on Pal Talk.  The same thing he would do as a boy for attention. 
[03:01:00]  Well, now that's it.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  Keep talking.  What's that, Bob?  I'm talking to Colin.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's trying to call me the Queen of England.  Hey, Colin.  Do you remember when Ray Romano used to do props at the end of his show?  No.  How about what you know what he used to do?  What's that?  Norton used to do them.  No, I wouldn't.  Yeah, you did.  You're a prop act.  You did.  I'd buy the enema bag and the parachute pants.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  Wait, what's that, Jimmy?  Yeah, you forgot about that four minutes, five years you started. 
[03:01:30]  The enema joke I used to do.  I used to have an enema...  You could bring an enema bag on stage?  It was an enema in a box, a fleet enema.  It was in a brown paper baggie.  And I would talk about how enemas were addicting.  And then I would do this thing about an enema junkie.  It was fucking...  Oh, no, you didn't.  I hope you guys laugh.  I had to buy this thing.  You know, just muscling it and overly eager.  Muscling it.  Oh, you've never seen a fucking more muscled piece of material.  There was also a message at the end of the act like,  hey, you know, addiction is a serious problem, you know? 
[03:02:00]  It's not true.  You ended it by going, we all have addictions we have to look at.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Good night.  All I'm trying to say is...  Don't lump me...  Don't have to say...  Do me a favor.  Don't lump me in with stupid Voss.  I have 14 years, 8 hours, and 10 minutes without a drink or a drug in my body.  It's really horrendous.  Going for the cheap applause at every show.  Well, in all fairness...  22 years sober.  With Voss, addiction is a problem and diction is a problem. 
[03:02:30]  Line of the day.  But he's not saying, look, I'm sober.  It's the fucking dramatic way he sets it up, without a drink or a drug in my body.  Like, wow, it really is a temple, isn't it, Tom?  Yeah, that's great.  He's always ex-archaholics.  They're always bragging.  Fucking hip hop on his kidney.  What, Kyle?  No, it just all looks good now.  How about the other day when he hit Keith in the kidney?  I can't believe there's like a mini race war going on at your pilot taping.  Yeah.  God, the word got out fast about that. 
[03:03:00]  Keith gave Voss a beating.  I was talking to Keith a day later, and he goes, I think, you know, Voss is on the other  line.  Voss called him up.  He's not satisfied.  This is like a serious thing going on.  Yeah, but Voss thinks he actually threw a legitimate karate kick.  And he's fucking...  He jumped like an inch off the ground.  He's kneading and bent fully.  I told you, 10,000 garbage cans can't be wrong.  Rich Voss had a kick.  Unbelievable. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, Keith was trying to break about it the other night.  You know where Keith is right now?  He's on a fucking plane to Alaska to open for Wanda.  Really?  Yeah.  That fucking lackey.  Is he really?  No, he certainly is.  He really is just an old fucking Negro.  It's cold up here, Wanda.  You got a problem?  No, I'm just saying it's actually refreshing.  I remember me and Wanda opening for Keith at Newark one time.  So happy that fucking flip-flopped.  That fucking Robyn Robinson.  That's the best.  Yeah.  Fucking worm.  All right.  We got to take a break, guys.  Bye, Kyle.  Bye, Bobby. 
[03:04:00]  All right, gentlemen.  Take care.  Hey, Bobby.  The Comedy Central special is tonight.  Let's make sure people check that out for you.  Wait, don't hit Kyle.  Kyle.  Kyle.  We lose Kyle?  He's good.  Yeah, he hung up.  God damn it.  And then your DVD slash CD comes out on Tuesday, right?  Just a tip.  Tuesday.  Can you call him back?  Just a tip Tuesday.  Bobby, can you call Kyle back for one second, please?  Hang on.  For real, yeah.  All right.  And Bobby's going to come in Tuesday, so he can really push his DVD slash DVD.  Colin.  Yo.  Hey, it's Norton.  I had, before we got the phone, 
[03:04:30]  I don't like you trying to interfere with my friendship with Jerry, by the way.  Oh.  What happened?  Interfere with what friendship?  Jerry didn't even, I swear to God, Norton came up to me and he goes,  Hey, Jerry, like peers, you know, like, hey, what's up, Jer?  Like, you haven't seen Jerry in a few years.  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm not his mechanic.  Like, you fucking.  Like, this kid's really moving.  Jerry goes, hey.  Like that.  No.  Hey.  No.  Like, I knew he didn't recognize Norton's name. 
[03:05:00]  And then later I go, you don't even know his name.  He goes, yes, I do.  James.  He had an accident that day.  He's at the cellar.  And he's talking to Colin.  So I walk over and go, hi, Jerry.  And he went, hey, Jim.  And Colin comes over.  No, he did it.  I heard him.  He said, hey.  Quiet.  So Colin walks over.  And he goes, after Jerry was on stage, because he bumped Colin two nights in a row.  Because he knows who to bump.  No, I told him.  Shut your mouth.  You didn't.  And if you would have said not bump me, he would have bumped you anyway.  So fucking Colin was fucking bumped.  Well, he could have.  Shut up.  You were bumped.  You stepped aside. 
[03:05:30]  And then Colin comes up.  Shut up.  And he goes, Jerry didn't even remember.  Jerry didn't even remember your fucking name.  He did remember my name.  He knows my name.  By the way, Jimmy is saying all this with egg hanging off his chin.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't want to say.  Is that what it was?  It was a bit of melted cheese and egg.  And omelet.  Egg on his face.  It cost him literally.  Right.  No, but I resent you trying to interfere with this relationship.  This budding relationship.  Every time Jerry liked.  No, I just didn't like the fact.  First of all, last night, you know, Kurt Metzger.  Yeah.  I shouldn't even mention his name on an actual, you know, an airwave anyway, because he said 
[03:06:00]  nothing.  But last night he came over to me.  And he liked.  Jerry was there.  I'm talking to Jerry.  He comes by and touches my shoulder.  Hey, Carl.  And walks by.  And I could tell he'd practiced it outside on like a fence like three times.  And he'd been there to come by.  Because he wanted you to introduce him to Jerry?  No, no.  He just wanted me to go hate-coat as he walked by.  Did you?  He didn't even stop.  Hey, Carl.  Did I meet you last night?  I was there.  I don't.  Who is this guy?  Colin Quinn?  Yeah.  Is he important? 
[03:06:30]  Not really.  No.  Oh.  Jim Jeffries.  He's a little.  Jim Jeffries.  He's a comic from England.  Really?  Yeah.  He's like Jim Norton, except with an accent.  Really?  With that fucking egg hanging off me chin.  Jim Etty.  Hey, why don't you go back to the Edinburgh Festival and run that shit by somebody else?  How's that, Jeffrey?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That was really harsh.  I didn't know that you had bitter comics in this country as well.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What did he say?  He said that you were bitter. 
[03:07:00]  Hang on.  Stop for a second.  Colin, put that phone to your good ear.  Oh, he's tearing him up.  Don't start with me.  Let me explain something about Bob.  Yeah.  Me and Bob are both guilty of being so fat that sometimes they're talking to each other,  and one or the other loses him, and it's our fat, our neck fat hangs up on ourselves.  And both of us have had this.  So don't just blame me, fatso.  You should be in a hollowed out palm tree canoe playing a ukulele. 
[03:07:30]  All right, Quinn, you are funny.  I'll give you that, man.  You look like every character on Dr. Seuss.  No, he got you, Kelly.  That wasn't bad, Bob.  Under normal circumstances, that would have been amusing.  But after a hollowed out canoe playing ukulele, you've got to fuck up to come back in that  one.  Yeah, just cover up and take your head.  You should have given a little rest period there, Rich Boss, instead of going, I've  got to fuck this one. 
[03:08:00]  All right, we've got to let everyone go.  We've got to take a break here.  So, yeah, so, Carl, please, let's, you know.  Carl, when are you coming in?  What?  When are you coming in?  I'll come in, I'll come in anytime next week.  How about Tuesday?  Yeah, come in Tuesday.  We're going to have a little party for Bob Kelly, because he's got his DVD slash CD coming  out.  Oh, that's right.  All right, cool.  That's nice.  So come on in Tuesday.  We'll have a little fun.  I love the party in there.  Why not?  Hey, today, Colin, you'd be proud. 
[03:08:30]  We had everyone smelling Big A's tongue scraping.  Tongue scraping gook.  Bobby, you missed a good one, pal.  There's people vomiting.  That's horrible.  Yeah, really bad.  I love Big A.  Yeah, he's, Big A, they love you.  I have a dream.  I think, actually, I'd like to see Big A wearing Lady Di and Marion's hair and being  on John Adams.  God damn it, is that good. 
[03:09:00]  I forgot that Colin's obsessed with the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Yeah.  Back in the day, you were just obsessed with those two.  Oh, he could rip them apart.  All right, Colin, you probably have, he's trying to hang up the phone for the last 10 minutes,  right?  You're chatty Cathy.  That's all good.  Colin, come on.  No, I'm trying to help Norton with his career.  If you could have just seen him, though, leaning over to Jerry, like, fuck this, now we equals.  Hey, Jer.  No, I didn't.  Hey, Jer.  Somebody's been busy in the business.  Did he call him Jer?  I said, hey, Jerry. 
[03:09:30]  No, he was just like, hey, Jerry.  But he looked at him like, hey, it's not fucking, there's no fear.  And then Jerry just goes like, that thing he does where he goes, oh, hi.  And then Colin, he wants to mention this.  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  Colin, he's like, I know him, but who the fuck is he?  No, no, no.  That's a pack of lies.  Colin understands that Jerry and I were probably very close, and it fucking threatens him.  Because Colin was on stage, Jerry went on again last night at the cellar, and then  Colin went on after, which is called being bumped.  And Jerry stayed to watch, probably to be polite.  Like, yeah, he's going to help push my car. 
[03:10:00]  No, he knows him a long time.  I was kidding.  No.  And Colin's not really a mechanic.  Oh, they're friends.  They're friends.  Colin, I'm trying to, you know.  And so I'm standing there watching, like, the last five minutes of Colin's acting.  I was just very fucking funny.  And so right after Colin finishes up, Jerry, I didn't know was still in the room, walks out.  And he says, hey.  And he says to me, are you coming up?  Like, am I going to come up and sit? 
[03:10:30]  And I was like, yeah, I am.  But then I talked to Colin for a minute and decided to go home, because I got a text from  my girl, and I was late.  Oh.  So you know what, Colin?  I might have went up last night, but I was afraid.  I didn't want to steal the whole show.  I'm like, you know what?  Colin means a lot to him.  So I went home.  Wow.  No, the best was, some guy in the audience walks out of the show.  Norton had just been on a couple of comedians ago, and hands him his receipt, because he  realizes you can't be a full-time guy.  He just hands the receipt to Norton, and Norton goes, hey, I go, oh, I saw you, and hands 
[03:11:00]  him the receipt.  Like, I hope you're taking receipts to let people out, because you're not a full-time  stand-up.  I think I was the fucking, well, if you've been there.  I thought I was the doorman who fucking probably sang for my supper.  Yeah, just did a few minutes.  Okay, Colin, does anyone like Jerry Seinfeld?  I do.  I love him.  I love him.  I think he's hysterical.  You know what?  No, I didn't say it right.  Does Jerry Seinfeld like anybody?  Oh, man, I know who he doesn't like.  Oh, Bobby?  Yo.  I actually was on stage one time, and I was on for like two minutes. 
[03:11:30]  I get the wrap-up sign.  They're telling me to get the hell off.  Get off.  So I'm thinking somebody famous is there.  I get off stage.  He's sitting there.  This is after the not-you shit.  I actually waved to him.  He stared right through me.  Oh.  He just doesn't.  He didn't even acknowledge my waved.  He doesn't want any part of you.  What did Jerry like the most is people like Bob trying to win him over, probably.  Well, we.  You can't do that with him.  Anthony and I have met him twice, and both times we got him. 
[03:12:00]  Oh.  Oh.  I had that like 20 times.  He doesn't like dirty comedy, does he?  I had that like, I don't know who he likes.  He kind of wrinkles his nose a little, his lip goes up, and he goes, oh.  Right, right, right.  Like, oh, you two.  Oh.  And he's had a lot to comedy.  His fucking Bumblebee movie was so fucking prolific.  Well.  Prolific?  Prolific.  Profound?  Yeah, it doesn't really make sense, Bob.  Prolific means a lot of, like, stuff to put out.  Yeah, a lot of, dude.  There'd be Bumblebee and other bikes. 
[03:12:30]  It'd be profound.  Dude, you know what it is, man.  He's so arrogant, dude.  He thinks he's got the market cornered there, but that Bumblebee movie, shut up.  I didn't mind the Bumblebee movie.  And how long did Norm give me shit about that?  But when you see him at the cellar during the week working on new stuff, he's like a fucking,  you know, 18th century French poet.  Hey, well, fuck the comedy thing.  He's turning the automotive world on his head.  That's right.  And at least I'm doing it in front of an audience and not my mirror, you fucking zilch.  You know what, dude? 
[03:13:00]  Just once, Bob wants someone to say to him, God, man, you're a smart dude.  I didn't think of that.  You've never heard that in fucking 35 years.  Every time you've said something you thought was interesting, people went, we know already.  We know.  We get it.  Bob wanted to just sit there and talk to him probably about the accident.  You know, hey, Jerry, what happened there?  You know, how did the car roll?  Pull over, and he's just looking right through you.  Here's how pathetic I am.  His dream is to have Jerry go, hey, not as bad as that accident I saw you have on tour gasp. 
[03:13:30]  Woof.  Dad, the fucking car's flipped.  That was a great move, dude.  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Bob.  Thanks for helping me.  That's never going to happen.  He's never going to be moved by anything you say unless you just leave, and he'll go, good.  That thing is out of my way.  That thing.  That fucking space tanker is gone.  I met him like 20 times.  He's going to be like, good. 
[03:14:00]  That giant Adobe building that was standing in front of you.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You fat fuck.  I sent him a Christmas present.  You sent him a Christmas present?  He's already got a lot of shit.  I know.  I couldn't resist.  Wow.  Where did you send him?  I was in Vegas.  Airplane meal?  And what year was this?  This is a few months ago.  If it's 89, I'll respect you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  I've met Seinfeld a million times, but you don't really meet him.  You know, it's like he knows who you are, but now I'm in Vegas, and he's for the festival, 
[03:14:30]  and I'm opening for Chris Rock, so Seinfeld's there.  He's on the late show.  It's like, you know, Caesar's Palace.  It couldn't be cooler.  Me and Rock are wearing suits.  You know, a big show.  And I have Buddy Hackett's hanky in my suit, like, you know, for good luck.  So Seinfeld comes up to me afterwards.  He goes, hey, good set.  I like your hanky and your thing.  And then the next night, I came back at a different suit with a different hanky, and he  commented to me again.  He goes, good set, and I like that one.  I go, this one was my dad's.  And next day, I'm having lunch. 
[03:15:00]  We're walking to the forum shops.  Me and Rock, he calls Seinfeld, so now the two of them are like, it's like, you know,  Hope and Crosby walking to the forum shops.  You can imagine what that looks like.  So we go to lunch, and I'm like, oh, my God, this is Jerry Seinfeld telling me, hanging  out with me.  So we walk back, say goodbye.  We look at some sneakers, and it's no big deal.  I feel like we had, like, a little thing.  You had a little connection, sure.  So a month goes by.  I'm in Beverly Hills.  I run into Jerry's manager, George Shapiro, the little guy.  He had bought lunch. 
[03:15:30]  I go, hey, thanks again for lunch.  And I just start thinking about that moment, and I get a block later, and I see, like,  a men's, you know, haberdashery, fancy store.  So I went, and I bought him a little blue hanky.  Oh, my God.  And a little letter.  Why didn't you just suck up to the celebrity?  He's my favorite.  He's not a celebrity.  He's a great comic.  I feel like I learned a lot from him.  I'm a good comic.  Buy me a fucking hanky, bitch.  Like, seriously.  So then, so then, so then here's, it gets worse.  So I don't hear anything now.  I was like, the other day. 
[03:16:00]  What's that?  Nothing.  Go ahead.  I don't want to fall in a little while.  So then I'm downtown at some party, and there I see the lovely Mrs. Seinfeld.  Is she a nice boot?  Yeah.  Very sweet.  Very beautiful.  Very friendly.  And of all people, my neighbor, Sarah Jessica Parker, goes, do you know Jeff Ross, the comedian?  And she goes, the comedian?  I was like, oh, my God.  Maybe he got the hanky, you know?  Like, she knows who I am. 
[03:16:30]  So I go, hey, I sent Jerry Seinfeld this hanky for Hanukkah.  And she looks at me like, what?  And she was just like, no idea.  It was just like, I just put my hanky.  Even if he got it, do you think he opened it up and went, honey, you have to see this.  Honey, come here, look, it's a hanky.  Did you leave a little note?  Yeah, I wrote a nice note.  I wrote a nice note thanking him for lunch and stuff.  Here's a hanky.  I've used it.  Well, it's like a $100 silk thing, you know? 
[03:17:00]  Probably wiped off one of his Porsches before he went out.  You know when you get a hanky.  I feel it's my only chance to ever tap with him.  He probably used it as a comrade.  Or he'll send it back to you with a fucking stool saying, put these two together, you know  what to do.  Or even worse, just wiped his dipstick after he checked his oil and just tossed it in this  expensive garbage bag.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  I'm full of hankies.  Whenever you watch him on TV, do you always check the pocket to see if there's a blue hanky? 
[03:17:30]  I have been late.  You know, you watch it, you go, he's got to wear it one day.  That's my hanky.  He loves the hanky.  Pacino's card got more respect in Donnie Brasco.  From one breath to the other.  Take care of that hanky's got a double meaning, you know what I mean?  Unbelievable.  I thought I was being like Sammy Davis Jr., you know?  What other faggy gifts would you be giving to me?  He's Jewish. 
[03:18:00]  In both senses of his ethnicity.  All right.  We really have to take a break, guys.  It was frankly...  Yes, it was good.  Bob Kelly, you can't get racist because there's an English guy on the show.  Let me explain to you, English man.  You're going to see it soon enough.  Let me explain it to you.  I'm Australian, you dick.  Is that James Smith?  No, it's Jim...  That's Jim Jeffries.  Oh, come on.  Who's number 16?  All right.  Who's number one?  You don't want to fill in for the other.  Jeffries is getting some buzz today. 
[03:18:30]  He's number 61 on Google Trends for some reason.  Google Trends, what's that?  Maybe it's another Jim Jeffries.  No, there's only me and the heavyweight boxer.  He's named after the fighter.  Yeah, yeah, there's a fighter called Jim Jeffries.  I'm more popular than the guy from the 1920s.  He's like, fuck.  There's not even footage of the cunt fighting.  You've got to think that I get more YouTube hits than a guy where there's no footage.  Hold on.  Hold on.  True.  Just when you thought we couldn't have enough comedians on the show at one time, we say  hi to Jay Moore.  Jay!  Oh. 
[03:19:00]  Oh.  Well, first of all, you know, it's Colin.  Hi, Colin.  Oh, Colin.  You know, that's really good.  Jim Norton and Caroline start to sleep with a waitress from Eau Claire, Wisconsin.  Telling his palates every weekend.  Guess what, Mom?  I'm on Broadway.  I like to throw a bone to the shop.  I don't know how much we like taxation without representation.  That's good.  What a zilch.  Walking around. 
[03:19:30]  Look at me.  I'm magnanimous.  I'm from the first of all.  I'll help everyone.  Fucking Jay.  That is my favorite impression anyone does of anyone.  Calm down, dummy.  Jimmy Norton all of a sudden is like, yeah, they're dancing on the stars.  The big judge is saying the big old British guy.  Telling everyone how good they are.  That was a very good joke, Jimmy.  I like your lines.  And don't forget to straighten your legs next time. 
[03:20:00]  I can tell that joke.  He does a perfect fucking call.  He's like Colin with better lines.  I can't tell which one's which.  We'll go to Colin's midget hand.  He gives him for his money.  You're all scarred from chewing on him.  Creep.  How are you going to whack that? 
[03:20:30]  You're the whole swarling.  It's Jim Jeffries gay.  Oh, yeah.  This guy wears a bonnet and just spank.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  You have anything to say to the other Colin?  I can't.  I can barely hear it, but I know it was...  Oh, jeez.  That age is a bitch.  Fucking great.  Why don't you go back to your book, stupid?  That is a good impersonation.  That's amazing.  The great white hope Colin sits around on his typewriter with a blinking cursor waiting  for the world to end so he has an excuse or not finished. 
[03:21:00]  Blinking cursor.  I was on the food art and the big meteorite and took out my apartment only.  That's great.  I had the British guy rolling in my aisles.  Hiya, boys.  Hey, look at Jeff Ross at the big boy table.  What's up, Colin?  Oh, goddamn, Jay.  Very good.  Fucking right on the money.

[03:36:00]  Yeah, do this  I'll see you guys later  He puts his glasses on upside down  It's a scream  You funny guy  Jim  What?  You wrecked my bed  God, crazy  Great, great grandfather story  Alright  We're not gonna get a laugh now  But basically  This is 100% true  Me great, great, great, great grandfather  Was on the first fleet  Coming out to Australia  Which is like being on the Mayflower  All the original convicts  And that type of stuff  And for an Australian  That's a very proud thing to be, right  And his name was George Bell 
[03:36:30]  And there used to be  A painting of him  Above our sofa  Of him looking all distinguished  In a suit  Like, I'm George Bell  Yeah, just, I'm George Bell  From 1788  And all that type of stuff, right  Now, when the internet  Came into play in our lives  They put all the crimes  Of everybody that went away  To the colonies  You know what I mean?  And it turned out  That George Bell  We always thought  He stole a loaf of bread  Or he tried to help someone out  In the dirty English government  You know  Turns out he raped six women  Six fucking women 
[03:37:00]  He raped six women  And we had a painting of him  And this is in 1788  Women had no rights  He really fucking raped them  Like, proper raped them  And even  Even by today's standards  You raped six women  How many women  Do you think you get away with raping?  You want another 40?  Yeah  50?  Back then  He might have raped like 100 women  Back then  You could probably get away  With raping a couple of women  Because they wouldn't believe  The woman who gives a shit  Right  Exactly  If they put you away for it  You must have really  Been doing some raping 
[03:37:30]  But here's what's great about it, right  He was one of the first Australians  To have a residential home  Because his sentence ran out  Earlier than everyone else  Because it wasn't seen as  That bad a crime  So he got out  And was ready to look around  And go, I'll settle right here  Yeah, he got a house  Right on the fucking harbour  Right  He was laughing  He got the good real estate  No, lovely  Down the rocks  Yeah, Georgie  Ah, the rapist  We don't have the picture of him anymore  It's still down in the basement  I want it really badly  My mum won't give it to me  She feels like it's a shameful thing 
[03:38:00]  On the family  Now it's shameful  It was a proud thing for a while  I would love to have it in a pool room  Or something  Of course  Just something for the real  They go, why have you got the picture  Of the old guy  Well, have I got a story for you  Sit down and let me tell you  About my great, great, great grandfather  Yeah  The rapist  It's amazing  It's lovely work  Living in a country  That was a prison  Nothing's going to be as funny  As watching you run for that banana  No  He raped him with bananas  It's a lot of shame  When I was in high school  When they had sex education  They taught us how to put condoms on  And they used bananas  Oh, fuck  What'd you do?  I just didn't do it 
[03:38:30]  I still don't know how to put them on right  Yeah  With your mouth  What if just banana bread  Or banana in a fruit salad  No, nothing banana  Nothing  It's not going to happen  It's just not going to happen  If even banana leaves  Sometimes in Thai cooking  They use that as a garnish  Or something  Really?  Yeah, I just ask nothing  And if I go to like  Java juice  Or whatever they fucking call it  I make them clean a blender up  They can't use a blender  They've previously used  That might have had banana in it  You think it's a sexual flashback?  It's not a sexual  I didn't like it as a kid  Mind you, I was having sex 
[03:39:00]  At a young age  It's just been very interesting  It's not about liking  It was obviously forced on you  Yeah, bananas  Yeah, fuck you  That's just an odd  You know what it is  It's an odd fear  Phobia  I'm not going to pick up snakes  And stuff  Most people have  Yeah, like snakes  Would be one thing  Heights  Things like that  Black people  An innocent little  Right  An innocent little banana  That's the inappropriate bell  Whenever black people  Are spoken  Of ilk
