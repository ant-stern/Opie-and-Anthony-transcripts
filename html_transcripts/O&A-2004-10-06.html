<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a song fragment, immediately transitioning into a discussion of their recent firing from terrestrial radio for a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral and their chaotic first few days on XM Satellite Radio.  The show is plagued by significant technical difficulties:  a substantial audio delay, malfunctioning microphones (especially Jimmy Norton's), and a completely non-functional phone system. They attribute these problems to their new, technologically advanced (but poorly supported) studio and the friction with building staff, including the night security guard.  They recount a particularly unpleasant morning commute, encountering homeless individuals and a moving garbage bag. The hosts frequently use highly offensive language throughout the entire broadcast.  The conversation veers off on numerous tangents, touching upon the increase in homelessness, over-reliance on technology, a French driver's experience with cruise control failure, past conflicts with former colleagues, and their intention to push the boundaries of explicit content on satellite radio (including a desire for a female caller to masturbate on-air). They briefly discuss the previous night's presidential debate, expressing their opinions on the candidates (Bush and Kerry). Jimmy Norton repeatedly leaves the studio in frustration due to the technical issues.

The show continues with a discussion of the 2004 presidential election, specifically criticizing the Bush-Cheney campaign's portrayal of John Kerry's Iraq War stance.  They encourage listeners to critically examine information from diverse news sources beyond Fox News. However, the dominant theme remains the persistent technical problems—phone lines, audio levels, and a significant audio transmission delay.  Numerous callers attempt to participate, but their calls are frequently interrupted by technical difficulties, leading to humorous (and often offensive) exchanges with the hosts.  Their attempts at usual comedic bits are constantly disrupted.  The hosts are frustrated by the playing of pre-recorded segments featuring George Carlin (among others) instead of their chosen material, and a heated phone call with an XM customer service representative regarding an unwanted subscription is aired.  The hosts lament the lack of female listeners and a perceived "gay undertone" in some pre-recorded segments, further punctuated with offensive jokes targeting racial groups and people with disabilities.  Technical issues continue until the end of this segment.

The next segment features more complaints about the audio levels and pre-recorded content.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton express their irritation with the lack of creative control, complaining about repetitive bits and the necessity of traveling to Washington D.C. for breaks, suggesting they could manage the broadcast entirely from the studio. The conversation shifts to criticisms of other media personalities (specifically Tony Danza), childhood memories of inappropriate drive-in movies (with graphic descriptions), and anecdotes involving their grandmothers. They discuss the "WOW" campaign (women flashing their breasts in response to stickers), their plans for new stickers, and the success of a flash on the Today Show. Further complaints about technical difficulties and coffee preferences (Jimmy Norton's Starbucks latte addiction) are interspersed. A caller describes marital problems stemming from the show's content.  Homophobic and racist slurs are used during a discussion of the Boston Red Sox.  A phone call with a prospective driver who boasts about his driving skills and criminal record is featured, followed by a news segment about a couple having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral and more complaints about audio imbalances.  The segment ends with Jimmy Norton recounting a story about a massage and his use of medication to achieve and maintain an erection, followed by comments about his preferences for women of different ethnic backgrounds—again, using extremely crude and offensive language.

A large portion of the show is dedicated to sexually explicit discussions, fantasies, and anecdotes.  Graphic descriptions of sexual encounters involving Levitra, enemas, and mocking of a "man pillow arm" Japanese invention are included.  The hosts repeatedly mock Howard Stern, focusing on his perceived hypocrisy regarding freedom of speech. They boast about their ability to use offensive language and discuss taboo topics unavailable on terrestrial radio, detailing various sexual acts and fetishes without restraint.  A "Nurse Pig" character from a Las Vegas encounter and stories involving urine and feces in sexual contexts are described, along with a host's childhood experience with constipation and enemas. A listener calls to question the excessive cursing.  They discuss a previous Today Show appearance featuring a woman with a "WOW" sticker and Howard Stern's alleged attempt to take credit for it, mentioning Howard Stern's potential move to satellite radio and their perceived victory in the battle for uncensored content. The segment is replete with vulgar terms and descriptions.

The final segment begins with a discussion of their early success on satellite radio and recognition from other media personalities, again referencing a "Wow" sticker incident. The conversation quickly becomes highly vulgar and sexually explicit, focusing on bodily functions, sexual acts, and personal hygiene.  A caller, Bob Kelly, recounts an anecdote about Jimmy Norton's allegedly unsanitary behavior, which prompts more crude jokes and descriptions of bodily odors.  Other topics include technical difficulties (phone lines), the death of Rodney Dangerfield (and a reminiscence about getting him high), Tiger Woods' marriage, a listener's question about the difference in smell between drunks and homeless people, a listener's introduction of the word "humiliated," and a discussion about a caller with a cleft palate (which elicits insensitive comments).  The show includes ads and a cooking segment by Tony Tantillio (acorn squash).  The hosts mention plans to reinstate "Whip'em Out Wednesday" and "Stoner Spelling Bee" segments. The broadcast concludes with further vulgar banter and ongoing technical difficulties.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I  Earth would fall back, natural habitat 
[00:00:30]  Just a rhyme without a reason  Never-ending phase, kicked enough for days  Now your life is out of season  I will mock you cry, I will help you die  I will run to you, now I rule you too  Come crawling faster 
[00:01:00]  Obey your master  Your life burns faster  Obey your master  Master of perfect, I'm pulling your strings  Switching your minds, passing your dreams  Don't you find me, you can't see the thing  Just call my name, cause I hear you scream  Master, master  Just call my name, cause I hear you scream 
[00:01:30]  Master, master  Master  Oh  Oh  Oh  Haha  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:02:00]  Ha, ha. 
[00:02:30]  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:03:00]  Ha, ha. 
[00:03:30]  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:04:00]  Ha, ha. 
[00:04:30]  Ha, ha. 
[00:05:00]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves.  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[00:05:30]  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the FCC be able to touch them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  Call it!  Call it!  Let's do it!  The blonde one.  The blonde one.  Radio shock jocks.  Our society needs borders. 
[00:06:00]  Our society needs borders.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Shot.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural  degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Call it!  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock?  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  We're in a delay.  We're in a delay.  We're in a delay.  Nice.  Nice, nice, nice, nice.  It's like an echo on my headphones. 
[00:07:00]  Headphones, headphones, headphones, headphones, headphones, headphones, headphones.  That's today's problem.  You hear it a couple of minutes later.  A couple of seconds.  Is it working now?  There we go.  Oh.  It was just one button?  One button.  Yeah, we're going to explain that today.  Anthony and I are technology retards.  Man.  We want to blame everyone else around here, but when it comes down to it, Anthony and I  are technology retards.  Yeah.  And you're pretty good with the technology.  I love it. 
[00:07:30]  You know, and I always buy the newest things, the newest computers and stuff.  I like being up to date.  But the stuff they have around here, and it seems like people will come in if we have  a problem and fix it, but they won't tell us how it's done.  They just do it.  So we sit here, and before anyone gets here very early in the morning, we're sitting here  like, I don't know how to turn this on, I'll be.  Right, well, the show started, and I guess at home, or if you're in your car listening  to this, you didn't hear what we heard, but when I was talking, I wasn't hearing it in 
[00:08:00]  the headphones until two seconds later, so to me it was like some kind of delay or  an echo.  Very distracting.  So one of our pals, he just casually walks in, pushes a button that obviously I should  know to push.  One button.  And then walks out rolling his eyes like these stupid DJs.  Like the tech guy bit on SNL.  All right.  They laugh at us.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's wrong now, Ben?  Welcome.  Ben, people hate.  I know, I'm sorry.  You're giggling in the background.  Stupid mics on all the time, sorry.  I don't like you giggling, Ben. 
[00:08:30]  You're having fun.  I'm having fun.  And I don't think Norton's mic is working.  Talk.  Is that, is this on?  Oh, God, your mic's not working.  Yeah, it is.  I hear him.  Really?  I hear him kind of low.  I think you've got to really punch him up.  Everyone's been saying I'm low.  I don't know what to say, guys.  Yeah.  You've got to get right on the mic.  Well, which mic is his?  Right here, Opie, in front of you.  No, this is me.  This is Ant.  They reconfigured all the buttons after we left yesterday just to make it that much harder  when we come back today. 
[00:09:00]  I think someone is effing with us after we leave.  I don't even know what mic you, talk.  Hi, Opie.  No.  Good to be here.  All right, that's him.  Oh, that's him right there?  All right, I've got to crank you up.  There you go.  Why?  I don't want to, I just.  No, you have to be.  So we can hear your lovely voice.  You have to be louder than everyone else.  Okay.  Is that good?  I'm already sweating.  I'm already sweating.  This is so frustrating.  I'm starting to think that we probably should have debuted the new Opie and Anthony show  November 1st.  Like November.  I think we needed another month to work out all the bugs here. 
[00:09:30]  You wouldn't know the bugs were there, though, until you actually got on.  So you'd have this problem into November.  So it's probably best right now.  And then trying to log on to something as simple as just logging on to the Internet to  check out some of the sites, see what's happening, a little few current events or whatnot.  And we can't figure out how to do that.  We came in here nice and early to prepare for the Opie and Anthony show.  We got here at 4.30, which if you're like a faithful listener of the old show, I know  you're falling down right now.  Oh, I know.  But yes, Anthony and I are taking this very seriously. 
[00:10:00]  We got here at 4.30.  We came into this state-of-the-art studio.  Yep.  It's an unbelievable studio.  And Anthony and I sat here for 45 minutes just sitting here waiting for someone to turn  things on for us.  Couldn't do anything.  We couldn't log on to the Internet.  I got this unbelievable laptop that the company just gave me.  Here.  Uh-huh.  This is your corporate laptop.  Didn't even have to pay for it or anything.  I don't have passwords for it or anything.  No.  So it's just sitting here. 
[00:10:30]  And then I heard a guy came in before and said, there's a ticket.  A trouble ticket.  A trouble ticket's been put in.  So you'll be taken care of.  It's like, what's a trouble ticket?  Didn't it used to be a phone call where you'd just call him and go, hey, dude, what's the  password?  Oh, yeah.  It's this, this, this.  There you go.  But now, like in the new corporate world, there's a chain of events that has to happen.  See, that's what I hate about radio.  I've been doing radio a long time.  Uh-huh.  It's gotten way too corporate. 
[00:11:00]  And you have a lot of technology.  And way too much technology.  It used to be you come into a radio station, you smoke a few joints, maybe do a few lines  of coke, you pile up your CDs, and you go.  Mm-hmm.  Now you've got to wait for all these engineers to come in to turn everything on for you.  You pile up your CDs.  You mean records.  Your records.  It wasn't CDs.  My records.  I don't go back that far.  Stereophonic records.  Some hot wax, as we used to say in the biz.  All right, so here we are.  I'm spinning hot wax.  It's day three of the Opiate Anthony Show. 
[00:11:30]  I was walking down the sidewalk here on 57th Street.  I caught up with Anthony.  You scared the crap out of me, first of all, because I'm walking, and I'm just in a daze  because it's early.  And all there are walking the streets at that hour are the dregs of society, which I'm proud  to be one of.  So I'm not expecting to hear anything.  And I hear, Anthony.  It was frightening.  I spin around waiting to see some guy with a cobblestone that he's going to wail over  my head. 
[00:12:00]  You don't recognize my voice because I'm still, you know, I still got this cold, and I'm calling  out to you.  You turn around all in a fright.  And then we're walking down the sidewalk together, and all of a sudden, like, a garbage pail  moves, and both of us jump.  Like, what the freak was that?  It's a woman that's a homeless woman living in a garbage bag.  Bag.  But it looked like it was just a garbage pail.  It started moving.  It started moving.  I was like, whoa.  What the hell was that?  We jumped a little bit.  There are a lot more homeless in New York City than there were a couple of years back. 
[00:12:30]  I guess it's that thriving economy Dick Cheney was talking about last night, how everything's  going up and everything's getting better and stuff.  You could always tell how the economy is by the number of homeless on the street.  A few years back, when everything was really cranking, there weren't a lot of homeless people  in New York City, now, every day you walk the street, especially at the ungodly hour  of 4.30 in the morning, and you just see people reclining on the sidewalk, on top of  the subway grates, a little dirty blanket over them, and there's plenty of them. 
[00:13:00]  That's because the bar's just closed.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, then, what I said is...  Those are just the drunks that have the jobs that start at noon, one, two in the afternoon.  No, one thing you can tell the difference between are the drunks and the homeless, just by the  smell.  That's true.  One guy will smell like booze, that's the drunk guy, and the homeless will smell like  a horse's rectum, really bad.  Yeah, you walk by, I swear, it might sound insensitive, but it's the truth, you walk by 
[00:13:30]  and they have this aura of stink that's just around them, because they have no home, by the  way.  You know what helps with that?  Well, I'm homeless.  Yeah.  It helps with that, and some teenagers have figured this out.  Gasoline and a match.  That really works wonders.  Oh, my goodness.  That awful smell.  No.  No, no, no.  That is horrible, Jimmy Norton.  So then we pass the moving garbage, pal, and then we get to the building.  This is adventure number 62.  The new home of the Opie and Anthony show, and we have to ring a doorbell to get into the 
[00:14:00]  building.  Yes.  How many buildings in New York City have doorbells to begin with?  Ring the sidewalk.  Ring the doorbell.  So we have to ring the doorbell, and then we have to wait for the drunk that is the  security guard for this building during the overnights.  What a tool this guy is.  Man, he must have did real well on his SATs, huh?  Yeah, this is just a guy that is so bitter about where he is in life.  This guy's a miserable fuck.  There you go. 
[00:14:30]  Miserable.  He's just miserable.  So Anthony's like, I just lay on the bell.  Yeah, because I walked up there.  Because the past few days that I've tried to get in, I ring the bell nice.  I do a quick little, you know, meh, like that, meh.  And I wait.  And I wait patiently for a long time.  And if he doesn't show up, I've got to hit it again.  Meh, meh.  And I wait for him.  And this time I figured, no, I'm not going to do that.  I'm going to lay on the buzzer.  And I did.  I just, meh, I laid on it. 
[00:15:00]  And the guy still didn't show up.  Oh, Pat, I hit it again.  Meh, meh, meh.  And then here he comes.  You can see down this long hallway through the locked glass door.  It's like, oh, here he comes.  Just take it as a fat bastard.  Sweet old time.  Yeah, he's sauntering up the hallway.  Yeah, just not rushing at all.  You know, not even breaking into a quick walk.  It's this slow, what the hell are you bothering me for walk that he does to the door. 
[00:15:30]  Son of a bitch.  And he gets to the door and he's like, what's with the buzzer?  I could be on the 20th floor.  It's going to take me a while.  You're going to have to be patient.  You're not on the 20th floor.  You're right around that corner that we can't see past from the door, sitting there getting tanked or something.  Or sleeping.  Or snoozing, right.  He's definitely sleeping.  Yeah, I woke him up.  I hit the alarm clock for him.  That's what it was. 
[00:16:00]  That's the alarm clock.  It's his alarm clock.  And he's all pissed off.  What a bastard that guy is.  He's going to be fun to deal with.  Everyone in this place, from the building guy up, hates our guts.  Yeah, it didn't take long.  Three days.  Not even.  We're in our third day, Jimmy.  Hates us.  It was two days it took to just get everybody pissed.  Well, they're going to just have to get used to us.  Yeah.  We're here to stay, so.  Yeah.  You know, we might as well just sleep until 530.  We're so motivated to get here early and get a good radio show on the air. 
[00:16:30]  And, you know, there's problems all over the place.  The technology we can't figure out because we're stupid.  And the technology has just gotten to the point where, I don't know, it might be too much.  And coming from me, because I love technology, we might have gone too far.  Years ago, people used to say, you know, oh, well, we've gotten too much technology.  And now, you know, if we ever get in a case of a big emergency or something, we're really going to be screwed.  I almost agree with that now.  I actually do agree with that.  Remember the older days with the big steel file cabinets and everything was in those file cabinets? 
[00:17:00]  And then eventually, when a bunch of people started using computers, the computers were just an easier way to access what you could get in those paper files.  Now they've just eliminated anything paper at all.  And once the big lights go out thing happens, you know, when the lights go out and we're all reduced to being cavemen again, we're just screwed.  We're going to be a bunch of soft people that can't even survive anymore. 
[00:17:30]  I think that's kind of a good thing.  It'll weed out the population of people that can't get along with a gun and a good fire and cooking your own deer meat and fun stuff like that.  But we'll all get laid again if we go back to the caveman thing.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  You're talking about just club them over the head and drag them into the cave?  Yeah, sure, into your cave.  I think we've just gone too far.  Everything has been overcomplicated.  The simple automobile has gotten to the point where, you know, I'm amazed at my vehicle. 
[00:18:00]  You know, do you know if I lock my keys in my car, I can make a phone call and somebody someplace far away will unlock my doors?  Or if I lose it in a parking lot, I could lose my car in a parking lot.  I could call a number and they will beat my horn and flash my lights.  When I hit OnStar, they tell me where I am.  That's very scary.  That is scary.  It's kind of scary.  And you don't think of it.  You only think about the good parts of it where you're like, all right, this is cool.  I'm driving.  I used OnStar for the first time during our trip to Cleveland. 
[00:18:30]  And I hit it in the, you know, OnStar, may we help you, Mr. Kumia?  They know who I am.  They know exactly where I am.  And I'm like, is there a Denny's within like five miles of where I am?  And they tell me where it is.  They tell me where the Denny's is.  Yeah, you don't have to think anymore.  You don't have to think, which is kind of a bad thing when you think about, I don't know anyone's phone number.  I don't know your phone number, Opie. 
[00:19:00]  I don't know yours, Jimmy.  No one's phone number.  Why?  Oh, no, that's all just programmed right in here.  Right, because I hit my cell phone and your name comes up and I hit the button where your name is.  That's it.  I don't need to know your phone number.  But if I don't have my phone on me, I cannot call you.  And that's happened before because you rely on the technology now.  It's making us all stupider.  It's making us stupid.  So things like, you know, getting a map out of your glove compartment and trying to find something, it's a thing of the past. 
[00:19:30]  Now with the navigation system in the vehicles, I don't have to know where I am at any given moment.  I just know my car is going to take me where I need to be.  I don't have to know how to get there.  So if something happened to the nav system in the middle of it, I'm screwed.  I'd be sitting there in between point A and point B not knowing how I got there.  Going, ah.  Yeah, just going, help.  On Star, I'm lost.  Can you help me?  And now you're crying through your technology for help. 
[00:20:00]  Help me.  You need help now from technology.  Does it help you from falling asleep on the way home from this radio show?  Absolutely not.  Again, yesterday, I think the only thing that saved me yesterday was a call from Frenchie wanting to know how he sounded on the air.  Anthony, how was I?  How was my bit there?  Ugh.  Go surrender and shut up.  You know, speaking of technology, you see this story today?  Driver feared that he was going to die. 
[00:20:30]  He was going 125 miles an hour.  A mobile phone call may have saved the life of a panic-stricken French driver.  What do I do?  Was it Frenchie?  Who found himself hurling down a motorway at 125 miles an hour.  Let me call Billy Mac.  But unable to slow down because of a mystery fault with his luxury saloon car.  There you go.  See?  The driver called police to say the cruise control of the Renault Velsatis had jammed while overtaking a lorry.  And that all attempts to break or put the automatic into neutral had failed. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  So he was just hurling down the highway going 125 miles an hour.  He's heading toward, like, I think, a toll booth.  He doesn't know what to do.  He couldn't even take it out of gear?  That's what it says.  See, that's pretty scary.  Worthless European faggot.  He was panicking.  He was doing between 110 and 125 miles an hour.  A croissant was stuck on my gas pedal.  He tells the police he was doing 87 miles an hour only.  And then the car just accelerated away on its own.  Because of his cruise control.  Yeah.  Maybe he couldn't look up to see the road because of the German head on the back of his hand forcing his mouth up and down and up and down. 
[00:21:30]  You will be able to drive once I finish in your mouth, coward.  But there's a great example of the technology gone bad.  Plenty of technology, man.  But even when you write things down, it doesn't help.  Like when you say you want a medium iced latte and you get a hot latte.  Uh-oh.  Are you complaining about the coffee somebody brought you, Jimmy?  I want to throw it at somebody.  I want to go down and find that Pat Cooper-looking building guy and throw my hot coffee in his face. 
[00:22:00]  Wow, he does look like Pat Cooper.  I hope he dies.  Yeah, he stinks.  Ben, what do you got?  You keep walking in.  Everything all right?  What's the matter, Ben?  No, everything's fine.  Are you getting nasty looks outside?  Oh, well, whatever.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  No, there's a problem with our phone system right now, as you might have known.  Oh, that's today's problem?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've noticed we don't have any calls coming in, and we usually have some calls coming in.  We usually have the lines all up.  It was kind of disheartening to look at the phone screen and see that no one's calling.  I thought people gave up.  Well, that's nice. 
[00:22:30]  We put out a topic out there that I'm sure a lot of people want to talk about and can relate to.  Technology, your vehicles, things like that.  And the technology itself of our phone says, we must be really brave radio personalities to put ourselves out there like this.  Put ourselves out there.  We're used to everything working like a fine-oiled machine.  I know.  It's just...  All right, so what's the problem with the phones today?  I don't know.  They're trying to figure it out.  See, everything goes through Washington.  It's kind of weird.  Yeah, that's the other problem.  We can't even turn on our own radio, our channel, high-voltage 202. 
[00:23:00]  We have to wait for Washington to turn it on for us.  Yeah, this is merely a substation that we are at here.  Everything has to happen down in Washington.  They have to flip all the switches and whatnot.  It's technology on top of technology.  I used to do radio back in the day where I had to turn on the freaking transmitter myself.  Turn it on, go down the hall, and do my radio show.  Did you have that...  That's all it was.  Did you have that big rotating pot that you used to have to turn? 
[00:23:30]  Turn it all the way to the right to turn up the volume, yeah.  Sparks coming out of it.  Any idea when the phones are going to work?  I don't know.  They're working on it.  They're working on it.  I mean, at least we got to listen to the channel for a little while on a boombox out there.  You know, rock out to some tunes.  What do you mean boombox?  What's a boombox?  Boombox.  Jimmy, now people are going to be very upset.  What?  I'm just curious what boombox he's talking about.  I don't know.  We got a boombox out there.  I was rocking out to the tunes.  Well, Jimmy doesn't have one because he hasn't done.  Oh, they have those? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Very good.  You still didn't get your XM radio?  Oh, no.  I don't have one.  Am I supposed to get one?  You have to speak to the right people is what it is, Jim.  Is there a guy whose last name is XM?  I don't know who the fuck else to talk to.  I've talked to 30 people already.  Is Xylophone Michaels around?  Talk to the guy out there.  All right.  So we don't have phones to go to.  No?  No phones to go to. 
[00:24:30]  Why is he even here?  I don't know.  There's a lot of tension in this place.  There's a lot of tension.  A lot of tension.  See, we came screaming into here.  The Opie and Anthony show came screaming into here.  And, you know, it's a priority show.  It really is.  There's a lot banking on this program.  And a lot of people are...  Pretty much.  We're pretty much going to change radio as you know it.  Right.  So we're kind of a priority.  A priority.  And because we are, certain other people and shows didn't have to take a back seat or anything, 
[00:25:00]  but things had to be changed around here.  Had to get out of the car.  Things had to be changed a little bit in these studios.  These aren't big studios here in New York.  The Washington facility is giant, sprawling, and beautiful.  And the New York studios, the studio itself, high tech, nice size and everything.  But the offices and the space for other people and other programs that are based in New York,  not that much room. 
[00:25:30]  So it's kind of cramped.  And when you're cramped in with the Opie and Anthony show,  you have to really get along with the program or it's going to be very, very uncomfortable.  And it's starting to get uncomfortable.  It's like putting a lot of rats in one cage.  Right.  But see, the Opie and Anthony rats, we all have rabies.  Now, me, we're out of control.  We do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Myself, I don't really, and I never really have had that much of a problem with anybody.  Even at the other place, you know. 
[00:26:00]  I'd hear things.  I pretty much keep to myself.  I do the show.  I go home.  You know how many times I heard that from people?  Like, you know, it's fine, but, you know.  What do you think the problem usually is?  Why are you all looking at me?  I don't know.  Sociopath.  Make the radio check.  Wait in the other room while I walk down the hall.  Napoleon, psychopath you are.  Oh, my God.  That's not the story.  It was Carol Miller.  It was Carol Miller, first of all.  And I wasn't the one who made her way in the mail room. 
[00:26:30]  How did that come about?  Ben knows.  Gary Wall.  Yeah, Gary Wall.  Our old program director, Gary Wall.  See, wherever we go, we have conflict with people because we do a very different show  than the other people around us.  And not many people understand what we do.  They take certain things very personally, too.  They take sometimes our bitching and moaning personally.  And don't take it personally.  We're just commenting on a situation.  But some people take it very personally.  They get very angry.  And they don't get along with the program. 
[00:27:00]  And that happened with Carol over at N.E.W.  Well, we were at W.N.E.W., which was just a legendary rock station.  And all the other DJs there took pride in being able to seg a Led Zeppelin song into a Doors song.  Get the lead out.  On W.N.E.W.  And they felt like that was a major talent to seg records.  Right.  All right.  Whatever.  That's what you do.  And back in the old days, you know, they got this whole thing that people wanted to hear the music 
[00:27:30]  and hear the jocks seg those tunes.  And the jocks were, as the jocks like to say, one of their friends.  The listeners actually would look upon the jocks as a friend that's sharing their music with them.  And that's all they had to do was get on and play music.  And they thought they were doing a very big thing.  By the way, can I just jump in as a listener?  I never looked at the jocks like they were my friends.  I looked at them that they were more jerk off who won't play Sabbath.  I hate the jocks.  And I hate the way they talk until the singing starts. 
[00:28:00]  Hit play and shut your fucking yaps.  Did it be the opening to Led Zeppelin?  And, you know, Robert Plant, you know, we're saving some money on this Christmas.  Yeah, the talking over the beginning of the music.  I don't know who started that one, but not a good thing.  What do they call it?  Hitting the post, right?  Hitting the post, yes.  Hitting the vocals there.  So at N.E.W., Ant and I came in and started doing this crazy radio show,  which was a lot different than the other jocks that just segged their tunes.  Yeah.  And there were fights every single day when, you know, we would take over the studio. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  And then when we left the studio, the next DJ would come in and go,  well, now that that distraction's over with, let's go back to playing the music.  Yeah, it was almost like we were tainting that legendary rock station.  It was like we were tainting it by getting on and talking.  And deep down, anybody that's doing radio and segging songs wants to talk.  They want to get on the air and speak their mind and talk about things that they think  the people are interested in and stuff. 
[00:29:00]  And their boss tells them to shut up and play the music.  So they get upset when a show comes on that is talking and just expressing ideas and having fun.  And it makes tension.  So the fights were just getting out of control.  Every day we were just going at it off the air, on the air.  It didn't matter anymore.  So the program director at the time, Gary Wall, ice cream man, he made a rule.  I had nothing to do with this.  This is why we're going down this road.  I don't want people to think that I'd make rules like that.  But he basically told Carol Miller that she had to wait in the mailroom until we passed by the mailroom 
[00:29:30]  back to our office from the studio.  Then she could come out.  And then as soon as she knew that the whole staff passed by the mailroom,  she was allowed to leave the mailroom and go down the studio to do her show.  So that was the rule that was put in place.  Right.  Yes.  And did she actually not like that?  Yeah.  She didn't like that.  Legendary jock told to stand by the Puerto Rico who's sorting letters while you young creeps  waltz down the hallway. 
[00:30:00]  Can't believe the legendary jock wouldn't like that.  So that was a problem.  You know, we had a problem there.  We always seem to have these problems.  And now there just seems to be a little tension.  And now we've got new problems at the new place.  What?  And one more thing.  Back to Carol Miller.  Yeah.  She was all proud of her segment.  She didn't even run her own board.  Eddie Trunk ran her board.  And then other people that used to run her board had to drink because they couldn't take it.  I mean, she was just such a mental case.  She still is.  It's all about the music, Ben.  All right.  So now we have a problem with the guy that does the Frank's place? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  Is that what we're hinting at here?  I think everyone here just hates us.  I was here until like 4 o'clock yesterday, and I don't know.  Well, this used to be their studio.  The studio that we're in used to be their studio.  And now they see us come in.  All of a sudden, the technology gets updated.  There's a huge Ovi and Anthony poster behind us on the wall.  All the Frank Sinatra discs come down.  The albums come down off the wall.  And it sort of seems intrusive. 
[00:31:00]  I think if you look at it, it could seem like we came wheeling in here and tossed everyone out.  Well, the guys that used to broadcast from here, yeah, they're feeling slighted.  It's kind of like this is their girl, but they don't go out with the girl anymore.  And in its place is a bunch of guys gangbanging her.  Yeah, and there's a big window for them to watch as jizz in their face.  It's not that fun to watch, I think.  And granted, maybe our attitudes coming in let me be the first to apologize for saying I can't wait to sling those records down the hallway. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, see, Jimmy, you didn't keep it quiet.  You have no tact is what it is.  I like being sort of a diplomat in certain situations.  I think I have a good BS line, and I think I could talk to people and calm situations down some of the time.  But Jimmy is just a lunatic who doesn't care what he says or what people's feelings are hurt or anything.  Opie, like you said, is just a sociopath. 
[00:32:00]  He doesn't really care.  Well, he does care, and he just goes the opposite way to make it hurt more.  That is true.  You care.  I don't care.  He cares and tries to hurt.  So it's just like one.  So I'm trying.  You know, the funny thing is I've been nothing but nice so far in this new environment.  That is true.  I must admit, I'm extremely surprised, and it has been a whopping two days.  The only reason is because I'm still suffering from this flu, this cold, whatever the hell it is.  But by Monday, forget it.  It'll be a whole new person.  I have to tell you, Opie, I am extremely surprised at you, especially through the technical glitches and whatnot. 
[00:32:30]  I have seen Opie pick up machinery, electronics, and throw them through walls.  Literally throw them through walls.  So I'm very surprised at your patience.  There was a, Pete, the old engineer, estimated that I broke close to $100,000 worth of equipment at the old place.  Yeah, I don't even doubt that.  Between phone systems and other things.  Not at all.  And you know what may have hurt?  In my attempt to be friendly. 
[00:33:00]  Could I be more clogged up with an uncomfortable, lactose intolerant, fat-titted little nothing?  I can't breathe.  Maybe I shouldn't take Levitra before getting a handjob for money last night.  Stuffy nose.  We'll get into what we all did last night in the next break.  Because I could beat you, by the way.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you can, actually.  I was talking.  I was trying to be polite.  I'm like, wow, that's cool.  They're finally building a bathroom in here so we don't have to go out and use the toilet out there.  And then I was told, no, no, that's the studio that they're putting the old guys from here in. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, my God.  It's a very small little box, so I can kind of understand the resentment and unpleasant feelings.  Now, what I'm seeing is, yeah, see, these are things that just upset people, Opie.  It's really small.  Our office is going to be worked on.  Right now it's full of construction materials that are being used to build the security vestibule.  Right.  So we are safe broadcasting here from these facilities.  And they had to do that for us as well, the security vestibule.  And that kind of threw things in a tizzy.  They hired a guy that could kill any one of us with his finger. 
[00:34:00]  With his fingers.  With his index finger.  But our office is the biggest single room in this place.  Really is.  And it's going to be our office.  Nice glass front on it.  Huge plasma, big screen television.  We're going to be loaded up in there.  Right now, though, it's full of construction equipment because they're doing a lot of work in here.  But eventually it will be cleaned out, and that's going to be our office.  Could it have been used to build a new studio about the size of the studio that we're in?  Yes, it could have.  But we wanted it for our office. 
[00:34:30]  So the studio now for the other people that work here is going to be made out of an office that was, I swear, a one-desk, one-seat, one-telephone office.  Yeah, it's the size of a big closet, a big walk-in closet.  I am feeling for these people, and I think we need to be a little more diplomatic.  Not only that, we demanded not only the conference room as the big office, right, we're also taking over the kitchen area for private offices for Anthony and I.  There was the little nook, I would call it a little nook, that was being used where you go in and pour your cup of joe in the morning, open up the closet, 
[00:35:00]  and there's just a big wall of non-dairy creamers and stirs and sugar and stuff like that.  And that's what that room was, a little place maybe where you go, hey, Bob, how's your night been last night?  You see the Yankees, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  A water cooler area.  A water cooler area where you might meet in the morning and have your little chat and crackers and coffee or something.  And you know something? 
[00:35:30]  That is going to be mine and Opie's personal office, aside from the huge pit, we're going to call it, where we will all hang out and play PlayStation games.  Oh, yeah, they're bringing in the PlayStation games, right?  Yeah.  All right, good.  So now we have pretty much taken over any space, any free space that has been here.  Our goal is to take over this entire floor, by the way.  I want everyone to know that out there.  All these cubicles, I already have design plans for all of this stuff.  No, let me reiterate, you're not being diplomatic. 
[00:36:00]  That is not the thing to say is eventually, do I believe it?  Indeed, I do.  I believe that there will come a point where this entire floor will be ours.  Oh, I can see where we're going to put the bar area.  But you don't want to say that.  That's going to be the green room.  That's where we're going to put the blue tarp for the blue tarp cabaret.  There's a bit of tact and diplomacy that needs to be done here because there are people that are still working here that, you know,  we shouldn't feel like we're coming in and rolling over what they've been doing for the past few. 
[00:36:30]  I guess they've been here how long?  Years.  Years, yeah.  What happened with the music this morning, Ben?  You were playing some music.  What happened?  Oh, Jesus.  I want to know.  Ben was saying something.  He's just bummed because one of the guys made him turn down his music.  Turn down the music.  All right.  He was cranking.  Because High Voltage 202, just before the O&A show, we play some nice loud music to get ready.  Gets us pumped for the show, man.  All right.  Well, we still don't have phones today.  That's today's problem.  Oh, my goodness.  And we really need phones. 
[00:37:00]  I wanted a girl to, like, I don't know, like, play with herself or something this morning to help us out.  Well, that would be nice.  I wanted to kind of test this whole satellite radio thing.  See how far it can really go.  I want to start doing all the things that every other DJ in America wants to do, but they can't anymore because of the FCC.  I want to really start rubbing it in everyone's faces.  So we could get a girl to just masturbate on our radio show.  Now, I remember on broadcast radio, what you would do is get a girl on and say, okay, could you moan for us? 
[00:37:30]  That was as far as you can take it.  And she would do some moaning, but there could be no description of what she was doing.  And actually, you would have to say that she wasn't masturbating.  But you couldn't use the word masturbating.  That's right.  It was this big, long thing.  So we, yeah, indeed, would like to get a girl on there to just give us some nice audio treats.  But, like I said, the phones aren't.  And maybe you can word it differently now since you're not on terrestrial radio.  You could say, I want you to rub your clit until it's shaking like Katharine Hepburn's head and on Golden Pond. 
[00:38:00]  That's one way to put it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow, why can't we get phones to work?  It's all through Washington.  It's all through Washington.  So somebody has to be down there and fix them down there?  This is where you and I are really stupid, by the way.  We're trashing a lot of people, and they have the ultimate control down in Washington.  No, no.  I'm not trashing anybody that's down in Washington doing anything.  I'm not trashing anybody.  I'm the nice guy.  You know, down in Washington, they've got guys that are from NASA that work for XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  This is how crazy the technology has gotten. 
[00:38:30]  Are you saying, then, Opie, that perhaps the phones are down because of something we said?  It's a thought.  Really?  Sure.  Why not?  I wouldn't think anybody would be that vindictive.  It's just a thought.  You know.  All right.  The success of the program.  Well, how are we going to play Stoner Spelling Bee without the phones?  We can't.  How are we going to get that girl to play with herself today without the phones?  Well, we could get one in here live to do it.  That would be nice.  That would be nice, too.  But we couldn't get a phone call from her telling us that... 
[00:39:00]  And that creep downstairs won't let her appear anyway.  Oh, that's true, too.  Maybe somebody else that used to broadcast out of here and make them just jack off on the microphone a little bit.  If you want to see that, Jim, feel free, man.  But I want no part of that one.  All right.  Well, day three of the Opie and Anthony show.  A few more glitches to overcome.  I got some kind of meter thing in the studio so I could control the mics a little better today.  Oh, you got some what they call a VU meters? 
[00:39:30]  And we're appreciating all the instant feedback as far as the show goes.  They're saying Norton's mic's too low sometimes.  The phone calls are too low sometimes.  Now I got some meters in here.  I could ride some switches and hopefully we could fix that a little bit today, okay?  Right.  Man, this is unbelievable.  All right.  We're going to try to fix the phones.  And I don't know.  We'll talk about other things.  The debate and baseball and...  Hey, Rodney.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Tiger Woods getting married. 
[00:40:00]  And hopefully that girl masturbating.  And our evenings last night.  Ah, sounds like you two just had a fun-filled night.  Not together.  No.  I hope not.  No.  After hearing some of the things I heard.  No, because I...  No.  No, it would not...  Whoa.  Drop said one.  See, you're always...  You're always fiddling with things, too.  And I've read that on Instant Feedback.  People are like, what's happening in there?  Is somebody running a teletype?  I haven't touched anything in here.  You like fiddling with things.  That was the first time. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Because I'm starting to feel healthier.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  So you turn the screw on the mic and the mic fell down.  I'm starting to get really juiced up for this radio show.  Oh, my God.  You're a fidget.  We had a peaceful couple of days.  It's just going to get worse.  Because I was on the DayQuil and the Sudafed and everything else.  You were tranquilized.  Valium, Unisom, uh...  Did it help your stuffy nose?  I have a stuffy nose.  No, I'm still stuffed.  You can hear that part.  Okay.  We'll take a break.  Maybe we'll play some Rodney Dangerfield in honor of Rodney's death. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah?  Aw, poor Rodney.  Martini Steve.  All right.  Thanks, Martini Steve.  Hit it.  Prepare to be wows.  What mockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Wow.  Have you ever been in a serious social situation when you suddenly realize you have to pull the underwear out of the crack in your ass? 
[00:41:30]  You take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?  Huh?  Who, her? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  Well, it's one of life's little moments, isn't it?  It's one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time.  You've got to get in there and clear that thing out.  You've got to rescue your underwear.  There's a letter in your mailbox.  That's right.  You ever been in a really loud party? 
[00:42:30]  I mean, a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking too loudly.  And in order to be heard, even by the person standing right next to you, you've got to be screaming at the top of your lungs.  But every now and then at a party, it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time.  And only your voice can be heard. 
[00:43:00]  Right, I know, I know.  Well, what I'm going to do, I'm going to have my testicles laminated.  Life's little moments.  You ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt? 
[00:43:30]  And you have to just kind of keep talking, you know?  And make believe it's part of the design.  Works all right if you're wearing a Hawaiian shirt.  But otherwise, they're going to notice.  Hey!  You got a big snot on your shirt!  Some guys are really cruel, you know? 
[00:44:00]  And some of these things are not even your fault.  These little things that happen.  You didn't cause the situation.  A lot of times, you're the victim.  You walk into some situation, and suddenly you're the one who's taking all the heat.  Not your fault.  Give you an example of the kind of thing I mean.  Do you ever meet somebody, and you go to shake the guy's hand,  and you suddenly realize,  he doesn't have a complete hand.  And you've got to make believe it feels great. 
[00:44:30]  You can't go,  You can't do that.  It's not even an option.  You're going to hang in there and say,  Hi!  Hey, swell hand!  Give me three!  Give me three! 
[00:45:00]  Hi, three, yo!  Not your fault!  You didn't cause that!  You weren't even there when it happened to the guy!  Did you just put a firecracker in my vagina?  I just wanted to see what would happen.  No, no!  Get it out!  Come on!  What's the big deal?  It'll be fun! 
[00:45:30]  Are you fucking crazy?  What are you doing with that later?  I'm coming closer.  If you blow up my pussy,  I'm going to bludgeon you.  Oh, stop.  Relax.  I'm just screwing around.  Ow!  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:46:00]  Morning.  I think our phones are finally working.  Jim Norton just had a meltdown and ran out of the studio.  Yeah.  He's pissed off that we just played the same George Carlin bit as yesterday.  Yeah.  Very upset.  Where did Jim go?  Oh, he's socializing.  He's out socializing with the other people. 
[00:46:30]  What's wrong, Jim?  Socializing.  I think the phones are working.  They're working, but now they want...  It's not coming up on your screen.  Ugh.  Nothing.  I just want to know that...  I think it's cool they have one comedy CD down there.  Maybe the Carlin bit we just heard the other day.  Give me three.  Right.  Yeah, I know.  I really got to get better.  I got to start controlling things again.  You got to have the meltdown, Opie.  Yeah, I know.  I know it's coming, too.  Maybe we should just go home until they figure all this stuff out. 
[00:47:00]  I could use a few hours more sleep.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, you can't do a radio show without phones.  Technically, we're a talk show.  Yeah.  And these guys have been working their asses off.  I don't blame them.  Yeah, we like taking the calls.  You want the mouse?  Making the listeners part of the show.  Remember the days when you would answer a phone by picking up a receiver?  Yeah.  It would ring.  We answer phones now with a mouse.  With a mouse on a computer screen.  I want to go back to the old technology. 
[00:47:30]  You want, like, the old big black telephone with the dial on it?  Oh, wow.  We got phones now.  People are listening, I think.  Do we have eight phone lines now, too?  We went from four phone lines to eight.  Oh, was that the problem?  Was it the problem because they increased the number of phones from four to zero?  I don't know.  Maybe Steve knows.  All right.  Wow, this isn't too annoying.  All right, Lee. 
[00:48:00]  There you go.  Yeah, you know what?  That is going to be one of the more annoying things that we have, because every time you  move this mic, it makes noise.  I've never seen such squeaky mic stands.  I know.  Boy, are we a bunch of bitching, complaining, just awful.  Let me defend the company on the squeaky mic stand.  I'm going to defend the company, too.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'll defend first.  Because this way, they're very stiff, so they stay where you put them, so they kind  of have to be squeaky.  You have to be eating.  You're right.  You just have to be eating all the time.  Dude, first of all, I'm hungry.  And second of all, I ordered a medium iced soy latte, like every good boy drinks during 
[00:48:30]  the radio show.  And he brings me back a medium iced latte, which, I mean, a medium latte, but it wasn't  ice.  And I felt it would be wrong to pour it down the back of his shirt, because that's how  you show somebody that you wanted a cold coffee and not a hot one.  Right, right.  Third degree burns.  Motivating.  I got you.  And that was the second cup of coffee that he fucked up.  The first one, I'm like, get me a regular coffee with skimmer, fat-free milk.  He brings me back a black coffee.  Do you want sugar?  Well, I don't know.  Are you going to whack your bag into that, stupid?  Because there's no milk. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  I will defend the company, though.  They wanted us to do some practice shows to work out the equipment.  And Anthony and I thought it would be a lot more fun to just kind of throw ourselves in  the middle of this mess.  Just get on the air, right?  I mean, I honestly thought that when we started our first show, we'd actually have an office.  We'd have the security thing done.  We'd have the studio up to speed.  Yeah.  But no.  I don't even think the office is going to be done for at least another week or two, right?  Week or two?  Look at it.  Dude, I'm saying month. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, month.  I'm saying at least a month before that office is done.  They claim it'll be ready tomorrow.  Wow.  I swear to God.  Do they have a time-stopping device?  Have you met the construction guys, by the way?  All the Irish guys?  Oh, they're great.  They're great.  Oh, yeah.  You fucking love it.  That, you know.  Unbelievable.  They're like a Belfast company.  Oh, yeah.  We got the Belfast guys.  Yeah.  They're from Belfast.  A lot of guys on cell phones, like, pacing up and down the halls behind the glass over there.  You notice that?  All right. 
[00:50:00]  So let's start the radio show now that it's almost 7 o'clock on the East Coast here.  This is what you're going to get every day, by the way.  This is it.  Well, I don't think you'll get as much bitching and complaining.  Well, the bitching and complaining has its place, though.  It certainly does.  But, you know, once we figure all this stuff out, as far as the equipment goes, I don't  think we will.  Then we'll find other things to bitch about.  Yeah, you're right.  That's the beauty of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're right.  They just made it very easy for us to start bitching around here. 
[00:50:30]  We're always ragging.  I didn't know our little microphone was on out there.  Oh, what?  Oh, they could hear the show out there?  See, that's every word.  See, that's the difference between you and I.  I'll say it right to their face.  You need all the volumes turned down all over the place before you bitch someone out.  That's not true.  I just like to not be looking right at them.  I know.  I just get all, like, cringey, and I can't do it.  I'm a pussy.  Can't do it.  I can't, like, rag people out and have them right there.  I'll do a job on you behind your back. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, I'm the worst.  I'm a real scumbag.  Jack the Ripper wants you to turn around.  You know.  I'm not the face-to-face kind of confrontation guy.  Oh, yeah, but in the face, like, no, no, no, that kind of stuff happens.  You know, you know.  Yeah, I'm the behind your back and then a little gas in your fuel tank kind of guy, you know.  And then I'll say, oh, what happened?  You said a little gas in your fuel tank?  Oh, oh, sugar in the fuel tank.  What an idiot I am.  Oh, get some sleep, you fucking idiot.  I knew what you were saying, though. 
[00:51:30]  You must be mad at that guy you filled his tank up.  Yeah, oh, I showed him.  Anyone else think?  What a fool.  Well, thanks for pointing it out, and listeners, what am I, gas in the fuel tank, you dick?  All right.  Well, it's 6.50.  Time to do a radio show.  Yeah.  Did you see the debate last night?  Yes, I did catch the debate, which most people would think,  Anthony, you're getting up at 3 in the morning to come in and do the show. 
[00:52:00]  What the hell are you up watching the debate for?  Well, my sleep habits are still a little awry.  I can't figure it out.  I cannot figure out how to wake up early in the morning, what I should do.  So you know what I do?  I drive home and I fall asleep immediately.  I cannot stay awake.  People are like, what you've got to do is stay awake until about 8 o'clock at night.  Then you go to sleep, you wake up, and you come into work.  I pass out the second I get home.  And then I wake up at about 8 o'clock at night.  And then I'm up from 8 o'clock until 1.30, 2 in the morning. 
[00:52:30]  And then I snooze for a good hour.  And then I come in here on about an hour's sleep.  Yeah, we've really got to figure this out.  I can't figure it out.  You know, yesterday when we were doing the show, Anthony and I have been doing afternoon radio for about 10 years.  So this is really brand new for us.  I want to say hi to all the people that got their XM radios tuned in.  Oh, a new batch today.  New batch every day.  The audience slowly but surely growing as we spread the O&A virus across America.  Yesterday, though, at the end of the show, I started getting delirious. 
[00:53:00]  Because I look up at the TV and I'm like, why is the Today Show on in the afternoon?  Oh, yeah, I know.  I get home and maybe I try to stay awake, so I throw on some TV.  And I keep thinking it's a lot later than it is.  Like, oh, where's Seinfeld's got to be on somewhere, you know?  No, it's the horrible afternoon television is on.  So who won the debate?  I didn't really get to see it.  I saw some highlights.  It just looked like, I don't know, John Edwards was talking to the principal of a high school or something. 
[00:53:30]  That's pretty much what it looked like.  I thought it was more like John Edwards looked like Cheney's son and he was ready to ask him for the car keys or something.  They were just going at each other like an old crotchety bastard, which Cheney is.  Cheney and Bush both at these debates look like they just could not be bothered, don't want to be there,  feel that it's their right to be elected for another four years, 
[00:54:00]  and they shouldn't have to go through all this silly stuff like debates and an election process and all that crap, you know?  They should just be given the four years because, damn it, they've earned it with the past four years.  And Cheney came off that way.  Like, he just couldn't be bothered.  He didn't even, you know, on the debates, how everybody has a set amount of time,  and then the moderator, who, by the way, last night was horrible, I'll get into that too,  the moderator says, okay, Mr. Vice President, you have 30 seconds. 
[00:54:30]  He goes, nah, nah.  He just would like grunt and go, nah, I've got no.  And wouldn't even utilize the 30 seconds of debate time to debate.  The guy was just a crotchety old bastard who didn't want to be there.  He also, I think, Edwards did a good job pointing out the bullshit from the administration  and how they twist things around. 
[00:55:00]  And Cheney, I don't know, I'd like to give the American people a little more credit  than to believe a lot of the stuff that Cheney was putting out there,  a lot of the criticism of Kerry.  I'm not a Kerry fan.  Don't get me wrong.  Don't get me wrong.  I know I sound like I'm a Democrat and a Kerry fan.  I'm not.  Well, yesterday you sounded like a Republican.  Today you're sounding like a Democrat.  I know.  This is how it is.  This is how it is with these two candidates to vote for.  No, I know.  Because they both stink.  They both suck.  We were on Sean Hannity's show.  He was asking us who we would vote for. 
[00:55:30]  And I said, you know, I'm not voting because I don't like the choices.  Yeah.  And then people, you know, are sending me an email, you're not an American because you're  not voting.  Yeah.  If you don't like the choices, you make a statement by not voting.  Right.  I'm not voting.  You're not voting.  I don't like either guy.  John Kerry seems sincere, though.  He seems like a genuine down-to-earth guy.  I'll tell you something.  He came off as a very prepared guy.  He was prepared.  He had a lot of facts.  And Cheney, again, just following this line of let's discredit, let's discredit Kerry. 
[00:56:00]  Did Norton blast a fart now?  Now I'm going to puke in the studio.  We're having a serious political discussion.  You couldn't wait?  You couldn't wait for the TNA break to do the fart thing?  Of course he couldn't.  I got scared.  I won't be farting today, though.  I'm nice and clean today.  So what Cheney's doing and what Bush does and their whole thing that they're doing is  discrediting Kerry. 
[00:56:30]  And the way they do it is twist around what he said and what he's done.  And the biggest thing that they've been hitting on is the fact that Kerry has been saying  the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time.  And how Kerry voted for the war and then comes out against the war?  Well, the truth of the matter is, and I don't know why Kerry doesn't spell this out in black  and white for the people, what he did was vote for the use of force against Saddam Hussein.  Which is fine.  You want to vote for that. 
[00:57:00]  And then when they say he came out against the war after he voted for the war, just because  he voted to use force against Saddam doesn't mean you immediately then use force.  That's what he did.  He voted to use force as a tool with diplomacy, with getting some allies on our side, getting  a coalition together, not just, you know, okay, we voted for war, go get them, boys.  It wasn't that situation.  But now they're using that.  And Cheney was pounding that last night. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, he voted for the war, but then he comes out against it.  Well, and so many American people get fooled by this stuff and just listen to it at face  value and take what Cheney and Bush are saying at face value.  Oh, this guy's flip-flopping.  Flip-flopper, Opie.  He doesn't stand for anything.  Open your mind up.  Listen to what both sides are saying.  Separate the crap from the fact.  Do some research on your own.  Don't use Fox News as your only source for news. 
[00:58:00]  I mean, you really have to educate yourself to what both candidates are for.  We report.  You decide.  Oh, the no spin zone.  Holy tornado.  They're spinning like crazy over there.  It's the Bush-Cheney machine over at Fox.  You're right, but it's the only place in the media.  You are right about Fox, but it's the only place where there's a conservative slant on  the media.  It really isn't.  I mean, look at CNN.  Look at major networks.  I would take, you know something, CNN, well, okay, I take CBS and I take Dan Rather as being 
[00:58:30]  very liberal.  CNN, I'd look at CNN more as they kind of put the facts out there.  I think you could make a better decision based on what CNN's broadcasting than what Fox  News is broadcasting.  I have more faith in Al Jazeera than I do in CNN.  I don't know.  I don't find them as left as Fox is right.  Yeah.  Anthony, I want to go to line seven because Pete has a comment about the debate, but my 
[00:59:00]  phone system is just showing a log on to Windows screen.  Oh, that's great.  Your Norton antivirus is popping up on your phone screen.  See, this would be a great time to go to the phones and get the other side.  Right.  I would kind of like to.  I'm sure people aren't too happy about the things that Anthony are saying.  Maybe they are.  Maybe some are agreeing.  But I'm sure other people have another spin on this.  But we can't go to the phones. 
[00:59:30]  How are we supposed to do a radio show without phones?  Do you want me to pretend I'm a caller?  Hello, I don't agree with you, Anthony.  Hey, that's a bunch of bunk.  Now to answer the phones, I need a username and password.  But they haven't passed those out to us yet.  Yes, Ben.  Ben's coming in now and he's going to help out.  Looking exasperated.  Wes is writing in on instant feedback saying, okay, who is Anthony voting for again?  Because no one knows.  Because you know what?  I'm not straight on this yet.  I don't want to vote for Bush. 
[01:00:00]  You're definitely a flip-flopper.  I'm not kind of a flip-flopper.  I haven't made a decision yet.  I don't want to vote for Bush, but I don't want to vote for Kerry.  But I don't want to not vote either.  There's two things here.  There's a selfish vote.  I could be very selfish and vote for what would be better for me as a person.  Financially.  Financially, tax-wise, things like that.  They should have a third party that's just like a really hot stripper.  You think she'd get a lot of votes, Opie? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, just to make a statement.  You could vote for Ralph Nader.  Who's pretty much working for the Republican Party.  Yeah, that's the Republican vote.  Who the F is he kidding?  If you're voting for Nader, you're pretty much just giving the vote to the Bush-Cheney camp.  Well, the meltdown will happen tomorrow, by the way.  Oh, I see it heating up already in Opie's head.  I will give them today, but the meltdown will happen tomorrow.  Ben, what are you doing, Ben? 
[01:01:00]  Why don't we go to the-  Well, we can't go.  Why don't we take another break?  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  This is morning radio at its best.  And we'll try to get the phone system working?  Okay.  Well, you're supposed to have a username and password whenever you answer a phone for a radio show.  Isn't that normal?  Hello, Joshua.  Tic-tac-toe.  The only way to win is not to play.  Faggot social message computer.  You ended up war games. 
[01:01:30]  Matthew Broderick should have raped that chick while the whole world exploded.  People are paying for this shit.  People are paying for this crap that is called the Opie and Anthony radio show.  That's not up to speed yet.  I feel sorry for you.  Yeah.  Send me a bill.  I'll give you $1.99 back.  There you go.  Send me a bill for $1.99.  I'll write checks all day long.  Hey, it's happening in the free month.  Take lemons, make lemonade, Ope.  It is happening in the free month.  Oh, there you go.  But see, here's the key.  The free month is supposed to turn you on so you pay for November and beyond. 
[01:02:00]  See that?  I was just playing devil's advocate.  And if we don't have a fully functional studio with phone calls and sound effects and stuff,  who's going to pay for the month of November?  Are we just actually waiting for a password?  Yeah, I got it.  That's what I was trying to do.  Oh, that's what Ben was trying to do.  We're just waiting for a password?  All right.  A small 1968 British man shirt.  All right.  Well, we're an hour into the show, and we still haven't been able to take a phone call.  But I think after another George Carlin bit, oh, look, look, look, look what just happened. 
[01:02:30]  Ben, put the password in.  The system could not log you on.  The system could not log you on.  Make sure your username and domain are correct.  Type your password and then type your password again.  Hit the cash lock button.  Sometimes that happens, Benny.  You know what, Ant?  If no one else is going to care, I'm not going to care.  Uh-uh.  I'm showing up tomorrow at 5 to 6.  And we're just going to throw a crappy radio show out there.  That's it. 
[01:03:00]  I want to know what's going on with this radio show.  I'm going to go to Bob Kelly's apartment and listen to that XM radio, and we're going to figure it out.  We shouldn't have to be popping passwords in like this on every computer screen that we have.  Okay.  All right.  There are seven computer screens in this studio, seven, no, eight, eight computer screens right now on this, and everyone needs a password.  Why don't you open up the window and maybe take a, you know, a call from the street.  Can I do that?  Give us a megaphone.  We'll have some kind of interaction with the gang walking up and down 57th Street. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, my God.  What, Steve?  Steve, what?  You want me to, you want a Rodney bit going into this break?  Why?  These bits were programmed four weeks ago.  Do you have any Jake Johansson?  That would tie in nicely today.  Those pre-recorded ones I can't affect.  The ones coming out of D.C. I can't touch.  But the Rodney thing, if you want, I got two waiting right here.  Is it a good one?  Get a horse.  Do you know what that's about?  Not a clue. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, that's great.  Because Rodney, it's got to be at least playable.  Just go to a regular, it's called a commercial break, but it's really a George Carlin bit or a Dice bit.  It's either Dice or George Carlin.  Right.  Because there's only two comedians in the entire world.  Perish the Thought, we play some Regan or something.  Perish the Thought, we play some Brian Regan, sure.  Maybe something from Jim Norton's CD.  There you go.  That would be nice.  Maybe some Bill Hicks, one of my favorites of all time.  All right.  We'll return. 
[01:04:30]  Opie Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  The Opie and Emity Show.  Comedy gone too far.  Yeah, it is Willie.  Can I help you?  Yes.  I got a letter in the mail and I want to be taken off the membership list.  What are you trying to say?  I don't want to be on s***.  I was signed up for it when I didn't sign up for it. 
[01:05:00]  What do you mean you don't want it no more?  I never wanted it.  Why would you want to do such a thing?  That's ridiculous.  Well, don't worry about it.  It's not any of your business.  I want to be taken off of it.  Who told you you don't need our service?  Who told me?  I don't.  Who told you this, your old lady?  No, just don't worry about that.  What do you want to do?  I received it in the paper and I want to be taken off.  Why do you want to take it off?  You just wake up this morning with a wild hair up your ass and you decide you don't want it? 
[01:05:30]  Who told you this?  Who told you you don't need our service?  What's your name, buddy?  What's mine?  This is Willie and customer service you're talking to.  Willie and customer service.  You just decide.  Willie, just do what I want you to do there.  Listen to me.  You're making a rush to judgment.  You need the service.  And I don't want the s***.  I don't use that s***.  Why?  Why?  Why don't you need it?  I don't use it.  What?  You can't live without it. 
[01:06:00]  I can live without it, Willie.  Come on.  If you change your mind, I'm going to lose the commission.  That's not my problem.  I didn't sign up for the f***ing thing.  I don't want it.  Hey, listen up.  Damn it.  You need this.  I don't need this.  Listen to me.  You people call up and make your mind up like you don't need it.  I want to know who told you you don't need this.  Hey, Willie.  How about I talk to your boss?  Hey, listen.  Listen.  Don't try to manipulate me.  You don't try to manipulate me, man. 
[01:06:30]  I just don't want it.  Take me off the service.  I want this s*** taken off my card.  That's it.  This big major, uh, uh, you can't...  It's nothing big major.  I just want it taken off.  And what's $60?  You know, the people in Ethiopia are starving and you trying to...  Don't worry about it.  That's my money.  Hey.  I'm not going to give it to the s***.  For the service I didn't ask for.  Listen to me, damn it, the people starving in Ethiopia.  You're going to...  You're going to try to...  Hey, Willie.  Let me talk to your boss, man. 
[01:07:00]  What?  Why?  Don't be talking that way.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  I'm not $20.  You're supposed to be doing customer service.  Yeah.  Listen.  All right.  Listen.  I'm about to drop the whole f***ing card.  Hey, come on.  Don't be talking that way.  Listen.  I'm not $20 off, but don't call us again.  No, Willie.  You're not.  You're going to take it...  You're going to take all of it off.  I don't want it.  Listen, man.  I'm going to knock...  And I'm about to f***ing drop the card here in a minute.  Hey, shut the f*** up, damn it.  I'm talking to you, boy.  Hey, don't be swearing at me, dude. 
[01:07:30]  I used to be a drill sergeant, boy.  I don't care if you've been a drill sergeant or what the f***.  You're terrible customer service.  If I want you to drop and do a hundred push-ups, I'll make you do what I want you to do, boy.  Pick up the phone.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Complete whores. 
[01:08:00]  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Desecration against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Uh-oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing, and then when they go too far, they 
[01:08:30]  suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh my God, is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper. 
[01:09:00]  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now with a new climate of radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news. 
[01:09:30]  I love Opie and Anthony.  My name is Opie and Anthony.  My name is Opie and Anthony.  Opie, great, beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  I love Opie and Anthony.  We stink.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:10:00]  Levels still all effed up.  Because now I got meters in here.  It's a work in progress, Opie.  When they're doing the thing down in Washington, the levels are a lot lower.  This is the complaint I'm getting from a lot of people that are emailing me personally.  So they turn up their XM radios so they can hear it because it's so low.  And then it goes back to something else that's a lot hotter, as they say in the business.  The audio is hot, hot, hotter.  And they're pretty much blowing out their eardrums.  Great.  We'll work out all these bugs. 
[01:10:30]  We were pretty stupid to take this on without everything all figured out.  But that's what we do.  Want to try some phone calls?  I think they might be working.  Bear with it.  You can say you were there at the beginning.  Yeah.  Boy, what a treat.  What a treat.  Hey, Bill, what's going on?  Okay.  Bill?  Bill?  Yeah.  All right.  I hope he's pressing a couple of buttons.  Perhaps that's the problem.  Bill?  No. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, God.  Bill?  I hear something.  Wait.  Huh?  You hear something?  Yeah.  What do you hear?  I'm not sure.  Don't ask it for me, Teej.  I'm not bad because the phone ain't working.  Hey, Bill.  Isn't that Bill?  Maybe Bill's just an ass.  Is he listening to his radio, perhaps?  Bill?  Bill?  Yeah.  Listen, listen.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, stupid.  We're talking to you.  Hey, asshole.  Holy S.  I'm sweating.  I'm getting so pissed off.  Try another one. 
[01:11:30]  Maybe it's just him.  Maybe it's Bill?  Maybe it's Bill.  All right.  Let's go to Max in Oklahoma.  Max.  Hey, what's going on?  There we go.  It was Bill.  It was Bill, you fucking asshole.  Now Bill's listening to himself.  Hey, it's my turn on the phone.  I just missed my opportunity to be a jerk.  Douchebag.  Hey, Max.  What's going on?  Hello?  Let's go to Max in Oklahoma.  Oh, he's listening to his radio.  Max.  Hey, Max. 
[01:12:00]  Turn down your radio, jackass.  I can't hear you guys at all, man.  No, it's not.  It's not.  I don't even know if I'm getting through to you guys or not.  It's not Bill's fault, and it's not Max's fault.  How come we picked him up and he said hi?  There's a button that needs to be pushed down on this board so they can hear us through the microphones.  I guarantee that's what the problem is.  Oh, my God.  What button would that be?  I don't.  We could just try a lot of them until it works.  Oh, my God.  Does the audition button have to be down when we're taking phone calls? 
[01:12:30]  Try that.  Let's try that.  All right.  Let's give it a whirl.  We'll try Ken.  Hey, Ken, what's going on?  Ken.  Can't hear shit now, boys.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Why don't we just go home?  You can't hear shit.  Here we go.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  They're doing something.  Hold on.  That could work.  Something's being done.  Hello?  Nice.  Ken?  Ken?  Your levels are just atrocious, guys.  You know what it is?  When you guys are on, we've got to turn our volume way up on the XM radios, and then 
[01:13:00]  as soon as you guys cut to a commercial or what you call it, we are blasted.  My windows almost blew off my doors in the car.  Yeah.  That's what I'm hearing.  And it's like, guys, this is fucking 21st century.  XM radio.  You're high tech.  You're high tech, guys.  Fix this puppy.  Can you hear us through the phone, Ken?  Now I can, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So we got that figured out.  When you guys hit the audition button, it went dead.  But then as soon as you guys came back, whatever you just did.  Well, someone's got to tell us exactly what we need to do here. 
[01:13:30]  Because now there's a utility button we have to push down to make sure you guys hear us  through the phone lines.  That's all well and good, but someone has to tell us.  Yeah.  Because you know what happens?  After we're done with the show, whoever's in here next, they reconfigure the whole board  for what they're doing, which is playing records.  And I'll throw you one ray of sunshine.  I switched from Sirius to XM because you guys came on, right?  Oh, what a great choice that was, huh, Ken?  Yeah, it was fucking great.  First off, Sirius had one good thing that XM doesn't have, which was that you could buy 
[01:14:00]  like a lifetime receiver subscription so you never have to pay.  But you guys came on, it's like, hey, I'm a fan.  I've got to get on to you guys.  All right, Ken.  And Sirius, their talk, any of their talk channels sound like shit on the radio.  I mean, it really just sounds bad.  And we sound like experts.  You sound better, but you're like talking through, you know, it's almost like, hey,  can you guess what's in Open Anthony's pants?  Because that's what it sounds like.  All right.  You turn the volume way up, you know what I mean?  It's like, this is bad news. 
[01:14:30]  But somebody over at XM has to be able to figure out why DC is a normal thing.  Any of the music channels, the volume is good.  It's just going to take a while.  It's going to take a while.  All right, Ken, thank you.  To get it all sorted out.  Here's the deal.  Let's make a pact.  Okay.  We don't come in tomorrow unless everything is set.  Uh-oh.  Because I'm sweating.  I'm getting so frustrated.  I know.  But, geez, come on.  This is day three.  We couldn't even make a week.  Wait, after two years.  It's day three, though. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I'm getting all the email.  Like, people are getting so frustrated.  I know.  They're getting really pissed.  Because they have to ride the volume on their XM radios during the whole show.  Right.  And they're starting to figure out whose volumes are too low and stuff.  So, like, if Norton's talking, then they'll turn up their radio because they know his mic's too low.  We might have figured that out today.  But then when they go down to Washington for the prepared breaks, their levels are a lot different than what we got going on up here.  And it's screaming.  So it's either screaming or too low.  So then they adjust the volume on that.  Then we come back live.  And then it's just blasting in your headphones. 
[01:15:30]  I haven't heard that the...  Like I said, half the good phone calls from yesterday, you could barely hear.  I know.  I haven't heard that any of the recorded things that we go to, the breaks, are too low.  I've never heard that.  I've only heard that they come on blasting.  And we're too low sometimes.  Sometimes one of the mics are too low.  The phone calls are too low.  Crank the phone's way up.  I think that's what we've got to do.  All right.  Well, let's try it here.  I don't know who you are.  Whoever you are, say hi.  This is Pete.  Hi.  Hey, Pete.  What's going on? 
[01:16:00]  What's going on, man?  I want to talk about the debate, but, you know, I'm concerned the phones are so effed up.  We might have figured it out on the fly here.  Well, you know, I thought it was stick for the last couple of days.  I thought, you know, they're just, you know, wasting a couple of seconds here and there.  You know, everything's fucked up over there.  It's, uh, hopefully it'll get better.  Well, you guys suck.  I'm glad to talk to you.  All right.  What's up, Pete?  All right.  Thanks to Anthony, and, you know, I'm going to do whatever it's there with the first two  minutes, you know, with each answer to each question where he's going to answer the last  one.  Anthony was talking about CNN and Fox News and how CNN is just, you know, more fair than, 
[01:16:30]  say, Fox.  Fox is slated.  CNN is more slated.  If you think about it, Carville and, uh, that tool from Crossfire, two guys that work  on CNN and do the whole, you know, uh, liberal thing and democratic thing, they're fucking  advisors now for Kerry and his campaign.  I mean, you can't get any more bias than that.  Look, I'm not saying that CNN doesn't lean left, uh, but I, I am saying that Fox is  ridiculous right. 
[01:17:00]  Well, if O'Reilly or one of those other clowns is over there, you know, advising Bush, forget  it.  People would go nuts.  Although I would like to say that I think Fox leaning right seems more obvious because  the whole media is so slanted left that CNN in comparison with other media organizations  seems maybe a little bit more left, maybe a little less left, but Fox, because it's so,  you understand what I'm saying?  Since there's no other real media outlets leaning right, I mean, except maybe the New York  Post, uh, you know, most of them are very left leaning.  So it's, it's kind of part of the course CNN to be liberal. 
[01:17:30]  You're absolutely right, Jimmy.  That's why I sent your CD to Iraq, baby, to support the troops.  Oh, thank you.  It's not very political.  There's a lot of dick jokes in there, but I'm glad you tied that in.  You think they want to listen to politics?  They want to hear dick jokes.  All right.  Good.  You're supposed to disagree there and go, no, there's a lot of smart shit on that CD.  Yeah.  Well, with the debate last night, Edwards, I mean, when Cheney brought up his Senate record,  it was quite clear that, that Edwards was over here, he didn't vote out of like 30 out  of 34 votes, you know?  All of those clowns in the Senate, though, they, they never show up for these votes and 
[01:18:00]  it bites them in the ass when they try to run for another office.  Well, they don't show up because they, they don't want their record to be used against  them.  Right.  And now when they do a lot of naysaying and when they do a lot of, hey, look, show up to  this and we vote for this two years from now when I'm trying to be King  Dick, it's going to fuck everything up.  So certain sites like, like vote smart.com, where you can actually go and see how people  are voting.  And this is set up by the Democrats.  And I checked that out myself.  You can actually see what they voted for.  It's, it's in a wacky, ponderous kind of way. 
[01:18:30]  You can see it.  It almost looks like Carrie and Edwards were trying their best to sabotage the fucking war.  Now that sounds like crazy conspiracy stuff, but the facts are there on the site.  By not voting to fund the war and then complaining about canvas stores and Humvees, you're saying  this and they're like, hey, well, look, they didn't have it going in.  Yeah.  Hey, you know something?  What I was saying before, I'm not, I'm not backing Carrie and I'm not, I'm not trying  to defend Carrie.  All I'm saying is, you know, yeah, Carrie could be wrong when it comes to that. 
[01:19:00]  And he could be, uh, uh, he wasn't, um, given the support to the troops like he says he  is now, you know, that's all well and fine, but it doesn't change the fact of the matter  that Bush and Cheney, uh, twist stuff around till it doesn't even resemble fact anymore.  Well, you know, the thing which they're both idiots, the both of the candidates, I can't  take them.  And Opie's right about not voting for either one of them because, uh, you know, I would,  I would love to be able to vote for somebody here, but I don't think, I think I'm going 
[01:19:30]  to be in the same boat.  I think they both suck.  I might be doing something really wrong here by comparing you to Bush, but I don't want  you to take offense to that.  The way that George Bush is a good president is kind of like the way you're good on the  radio.  Like, I don't expect you to be able to work the boards and to figure out phone calls and  shit like that.  But, you know, you have the right message.  You know how to put a guy out a good show.  I think the president's kind of similar in that respect where he knows how to, he knows  what he needs to do.  He knows how he needs to do it.  And when it comes to bullshit, like debates where it's, it's down to popularity and who's 
[01:20:00]  got the facts, he just can't be bothered with that shit.  These debates are, it comes down to who looks the best on TV.  Right.  Someone, someone mentioned, I think it was in a New York times article.  They said you can make a choice by, uh, turning down the sound and just looking at both  candidates.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  That's what, to see who looks smoother.  Who's not, you know, smugging for the camera.  Who's keeping his cool.  Who has the right makeup on and his hair done the right way.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And people are like, look how flustered George Bush looked. 
[01:20:30]  He's sitting there rolling his eyes.  Yeah.  So, so Bush looked flustered during his debate.  So a bunch of people are going to vote for Kerry.  Well, yeah.  That's how stupid America is in general.  That's all they need to go.  You know what?  I don't like how he was smugging for the camera, so now I'm going to vote for Kerry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bush didn't seem comfortable in his answers, though.  I mean, I like Bush more than Kerry, but Kerry was much better in that debate.  Look, I want honesty out of a president, but it's like, I don't want the, well, you know,  I don't know, I guess.  You know, it's like, Jesus, could you at least act confident in your decision, stupid?  And let's get rid of the awful.  Let's get rid of the red lights, the green lights, the blue lights, and just let these two 
[01:21:00]  candidates just go at it.  Too many rules.  I hate the rules.  They can't talk to each other.  Give them a subject and let them just go at it.  That's what I want to see.  Isn't that what a debate is?  They're supposed to debate each other?  Right.  They don't.  There's no interaction.  It's called a debate, but no, you talk for two minutes, then he'll talk for two minutes,  then you can respond for a minute, and then you can respond for 30 seconds.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  And then the whole time you're watching the debate, you're like, oh my God, get your point  and the light's turning.  I'm just watching the light.  I'm so distracted by the light going, is it going to end before the light stops? 
[01:21:30]  Oh my God.  Oh, forget it.  If the buzzer goes off, people's heads are going to explode all around the country.  They're going to be so psyched.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right.  There you go.  The phones are working.  It's now an hour and 20 minutes into the show.  Now I will shed the image that people might have of me now as a liberal by saying I love  the fact that the assault weapons ban is expired.  Yeah.  Buy me an AR.  Nice.  I don't think assault weapons are appropriate unless you have a trench coat and you're in high 
[01:22:00]  school.  Then you're thinking.  Yeah.  Then they should be handed out to high school students.  God, have fun.  Shoot each other, you little spoiled jizz buckets.  All right.  Let's try another phone call here.  Who's this?  This is Chad.  Hey, Chad.  What's going on today?  Not much.  Not much.  Hey, I got two things for you guys.  Well, actually three.  You guys are working at the same radio station I worked at in college.  I swear to God, everything going wrong.  College, great.  I'm so glad that I have been in radio 20 years so I could go back to college radio stuff. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, right.  The audience is as big as college radio so far, but growing every day.  Every day.  And we knew what we were getting into here, so that's fine.  You know, the ONA virus will be spreading slowly but surely across America.  I do have to say this because I know there's going to be a lot of people bummed in Washington  at the XM facility down there.  Oh, my God, they're going to be manic.  Because we just pitched for the last hour and a half, but I'm having more fun on XM Satellite  Radio than I've had in probably five years.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  And it's going to just get better every day. 
[01:23:00]  So with that said, what do you got, Chad?  Well, I wanted to make a suggestion to you.  You guys need to get a hold of some of your old CDs and just grab the sound effects off of  those, and also thank you for letting us know what that horrible noise was when you  guys were adjusting the mics because it sounded like you were busting ass.  Oh, really?  What?  Oh, yeah.  That?  All right.  Yes.  Thank you, Chad.  All right, bye.  All right, bye.  So there you go.  And somebody was complaining about Jimmy eating, I think. 
[01:23:30]  Were you eating and crinkling paper on the air?  No, he crinkles the paper.  If you hear a crinkle from me, it's because there's a little fella in a bag.  I do eat on the air.  Yeah, we should explain.  I crinkle all the instant feedback when I'm done reading it.  Ben is the one that's cackling like an asshole in the background.  Or breathing heavy into the mic.  Or breathing heavy.  And he's the only one that's not congested, but for some reason he's breathing heavily.  Yeah.  And Norton's the one that has no problem just talking with his mouth full.  You're right.  I do tend to eat. 
[01:24:00]  And Anthony, probably a professional broadcaster.  I'm trying to be professional here, but...  Look, you keep your hands on your lap.  It's kind of breaking down.  I have to be, like, just touching things.  I know.  I'm not moving my mic at all.  I try to keep that still so it doesn't make that creaky noise.  I try to be a professional broadcaster, but in this situation, it's a little rough.  Want to go to Kansas and talk to Chuck?  Let's talk to Chuck in Kansas.  We've been so distracted, we haven't even really set up the show yet today.  I mean, we've got Stoner Spelling Bee.  We've got to try that today.  Yeah.  Or maybe we'll wait for tomorrow now at this point. 
[01:24:30]  Well, the phones are crucial for that game.  And it's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  We've got to get that going again.  That's going to be a slow process.  But we're going to start that up today.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, a couple things.  First of all, this is the first day that the sound sounds excellent.  You guys, everything is up.  Even Norton's talking.  You can hear him good.  Oh, maybe we're getting it figured out a little bit.  Because they gave me meters in here.  Yeah, keep it out of Washington, I think, like everything else.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me move your volume up a little bit.  I think you're a little low. 
[01:25:00]  Attaboy, Hope.  Oh, you were a little high there, Jim.  Wait, let me lower you a bit.  Let's get us all evened out.  All right.  Seems like everything else that goes through Washington, it gets fucked up.  You guys keep control of it there, because it sounds great today.  But I listened to your promo thing, and one thing that was mentioned that got my interest was sex for Allah.  Oh, yeah, the sex for Allah, yes.  Yeah, if we do that, how about let's throw a twist in it this time and make the couple maybe an interracial retarded couple or something.  All right.  Or maybe instead of the anal being the two-point conversion, if he cuts off a clit, that's two points. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, I'll have to shout out the word Howard Stern right about the time the guy's about ready to load off or something.  We could throw in some more.  All right, Chuck.  When are you guys going to get to your hit list, all the people you got to get back at?  Well, we have to take care of everybody around here first.  I got a whole vendetta list, but we have to get the show in shape here first.  We have to make sure everything works.  Well, you guys saved me from not having listened to all the politics and bullshit this time of year.  And then what did we do? 
[01:26:00]  Talk about politics.  Yeah, that's it for politics.  Just being on the air.  Man, that beats the shit out of listening to those boring parts that we're hashing them out.  All right, Chuck.  Thank you.  Chuck from Kansas.  It's amazing how much you write the callers love the cursing, because no matter how smart the political commentary they're making,  like, you know, and Kerry raised a good fucking point.  I'm trying to make a rule on the show, especially with the callers.  Don't curse just to curse.  We don't care if you curse, but a lot of people are like, oh, wow, it's satellite radio.  We just got to throw the F-bombs like crazy out there. 
[01:26:30]  The rule should just be don't curse just to curse.  Use it, don't abuse it.  Wow, I like that.  All right.  And we would play a lot more sound effects, but we're still too scared to do that.  Yeah.  We were joking the first day we only had one sound effect.  Of course we had the whole machine loaded.  A lot of people are like, they had two years.  Why didn't they load up their machine with all their sound bites?  But we're too scared to use it, because we don't know where the levels are going to be on that.  See, that's a little low still.  All right.  Let me move you up.  Try that again, Anthony.  You beast. 
[01:27:00]  You savage.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Bark like a dog.  I will teach you the meaning of the word of respect.  Ah!  Oh!  Hmm.  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  Okay.  All right.  Sex Bagel, you can get rid of all the people that want to talk about the debate.  I think we're boring people with that.  Let's say hi to Roman in New Jersey.  What's up, Roman?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Listen, I don't know if you were aware of this, but one of your sweepers that you were 
[01:27:30]  playing right before you came on this time, one of the guys there in Russian mentioned  that Opie's schlong is beautiful and long.  Ah, more gay stuff.  In Russian?  In Russian, dude.  That's the other thing we've got to fix with this show.  There's a gay undertone happening with all the sweepers and what?  Yeah, and where the hell did you get a Russian guy to talk about your schlong, Opie?  Hey, what's to fix?  Steve, what's that about?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Wait, hold on.  Unless Steve's level's good.  I can't hear Steve.  Yes, Steve. 
[01:28:00]  I was constructing those production pieces, and we had a lot of...  Hold on, Steve.  Yeah.  Okay.  Making those sweepers, I was looking for a little bit of flavor.  So some of the interns we were interviewing...  Steve, your mic is too low.  Whatever you talk, I can't hear you on one side of my...  Turn your mic up.  And why...  You know, we're paying you a lot of money to sit there and just, like, ride volume controls.  I don't know how I can hear it.  It's...  Dude, I'm...  You're too low.  How could it possibly be too low?  It's right... 
[01:28:30]  I'm looking at it.  It's dead even with yours.  No.  You're too...  No.  No.  All right.  How's that?  That's much better.  All right.  You got it.  All right.  You're too low.  Because what happens is people are going to turn up their XM radios because they want  to hear what you have to say because it's going to be so fascinating, and then we're  going to go back to the show, and we're going to blast everyone out.  That's right.  That's the problem that everyone's been emailing us with.  These fucking video meters.  All right.  Okay.  I was making those production pieces, and I wanted to do something a little different, so  some of the interns that we were interviewing spoke fluent foreign languages. 
[01:29:00]  So if you listen, you'll hear some Russian.  You'll hear some Japanese.  And one of them I just told to riff in Russian, and I had no idea what he said, so I just stuck  it in there, and I figured that somebody who knew the language was going to call in  at some point and tell me what he said.  Look, we don't mind the gay.  We just don't mind the gay, but it's a little too heavy on the gay.  That's all I want to say.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, now that we got gay guys from all over the country going, what, you don't  like gay guys?  We don't mind the gay.  But there's a major gay undertone on this show right now with all the sweepers.  We shouldn't have so much of the gay. 
[01:29:30]  One of the sweepers has us getting butt-effed by convicts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little too much.  Maybe we can have some girls doing something.  That would be nice.  On some of the sweepers.  Instead of guys talking about our asses.  Sharon from Arizona.  Hold on.  Now Norton's pissed.  We're going to spend the whole day just bitching until everything's right.  Yes, Norton?  I just, I think I figured out why Martini Steve sounds lower than he should.  Because when he's talking, I'm only hearing him in one microphone, like in one headphone. 
[01:30:00]  One headphone.  And yet I'm hearing you guys perfectly clearly.  So obviously, if he's supposed to come through on two channels, he's probably coming through  on one.  That's my idea of technical knowledge.  Jim, are you aware that one of your headphones is not on your ear?  No, it is.  But that's, now, talk again.  Okay.  Like this.  I can only hear you in my left one.  Oh, for Christ's sake.  And now you sound.  Yeah, I can hear Opie in both.  You sound in the distance.  The other thing that has to happen.  See, I just got to get better.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to lose your mind and I can see it coming.  I see it bubbling.  No, Norton needs what's called an omnidirectional mic. 
[01:30:30]  Because I move a lot.  He moves around a lot.  He's a stand-up comedian.  So he's used to moving and going like over here.  And as soon as you leave the microphone, you drop out.  And then the listeners get frustrated because they can't hear you.  I just wish the listeners could see the funny faces I make.  Because that really just kind of drives it home, folks.  I wink a lot.  Sharon, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I always had heard about how great you were.  Yesterday or the day before was my first time listening.  And I'm really surprised to hear you keep saying that your listenership is so man-driven. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, we need more girls.  I'm amazed at...  Yeah, Sharon from Arizona.  Hello?  Where'd she go?  Sharon?  That might be Sharon's fault, though.  She has a chick on her phone that could be her fault.  She's amazed at, and then she dropped off the face of the earth.  No, the reality is we don't have a lot of female listeners.  We've got to bring them back to the table.  I don't think Frenchie using the C word ten times in one phone call is going to help personally, but girls don't seem to like that word. 
[01:31:30]  I don't want to censor people.  That's the key to this show.  We'll let people do what they want to do.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  For what reason, I don't know why, but...  Anyone got to take a leak?  I got to take a leak.  All right.  I'll grab another cup of tea.  Maybe I'll go in the bathroom with you, and I'll take a leak next to you.  We'll talk about the show.  Whatever else we want to talk about.  Well, we want to talk about your Yankee Cranky.  Okay.  Oh, you had an interesting evening, too. 
[01:32:00]  I had a very interesting night.  I could top your Yankee Cranky, and we got to talk about Whip Them Out Wednesday, and  hopefully, if we feel confident enough, we'll do stoner spelling bee, but we need the phones  working.  They look like they're working now.  I don't want to continue bitching.  Because half these guys could kick my ass.  Day three of this mess.  What's the matter, Ben?  Holy crap.  Wow.  Ben came in looking like a...  Ben, how many hours sleep did you have last night?  Not that much.  It's obvious.  You all right?  Your long-sleeved shirt just comes past your belt by an eighth of an inch. 
[01:32:30]  Why are you ragging on poor John's shirt?  Let's talk about what you wear.  I'm a mess.  I know the mess.  But you have a short shirt, and I don't like it.  It's a long shirt.  It just comes...  A long...  Look at what my shirt comes down to.  Way past my smaller-than-average bag.  I got to say something.  Ben's shirt ending there is kind of normal.  It's not.  Your shirt...  No, your shirt shouldn't go down to your bag.  It should.  Only if you're covering stuff.  Maybe I am.  Like, T-shirts that come down low are usually reserved for people that are trying to cover 
[01:33:00]  up something they don't want the rest of the people to see.  Like my fat stomach?  Could be.  That's what you think.  I think you'll look fine, Jimmy.  All right.  It's cold out today, too.  Notice that?  So then wear a shirt that covers your belly button.  What the hell is wrong with the shirt?  Nothing.  You have a loss.  That's not Steve's case about dress...  Well, at least he dressed well today.  No, he's not dressed well today.  It's like Sammy the Bull when he's lounging.  That outfit sucks.  Why is Steve trying to argue with Jim without turning on a microphone?  Yeah.  Hey, turn it...  You want to turn it on, Martini, Steve?  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you. 
[01:33:30]  I can hear you in my left ear.  Wait.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Now it's on.  What exactly is wrong with this shirt?  I can't hear a word you're saying in the right ear.  What?  Can you hear one ear at least?  Is one fucking ear working, Jim?  Nope.  Only one ear working.  I'm not listening to you until you fix your goddamn levels.  Fine.  Bye.  I can't hear a word you're saying, MS.  Seeing?  Whatever.  I said saying, didn't I?  No, you did not.  I'm tired, Opie.  I'm on...  All right.  We're going to have to do something that people want to listen to next.  Right.  Right.  Something where they're going to go, wow, I really need to listen to Opie and Anthony every 
[01:34:00]  day.  Not an hour and a half of trying to fix stuff that isn't working.  Doohickeys.  Doohickeys?  Then we can talk about stupid Robert Kelly trying to call in yesterday, finally, and have  Anthony go, hello, hello.  And Bob, who was listening to his radio, didn't realize you were talking to him until you hung  up.  Yeah, that's the other thing.  There is a slight delay, people.  Yeah.  So don't listen to your radio when you're calling.  Because the signal has to go from here down to Washington, then NASA has to decipher it,  then shoot it up to the satellite, and then it goes back down to Washington, back up to 
[01:34:30]  New York.  Yeah.  And I think that takes about eight seconds.  Takes a while.  That's what I think.  Get up into outer space.  I'm not a technology whiz, but I think there's a delay because it's going through all sorts of  stages.  Yeah.  Are we talking about my new favorite show when we come back?  The Tony Danza Show.  Hey, there's a tease.  We'll be back.  It was Whip Him Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great. 
[01:35:00]  Please, wow responsibly.  And here, as long as we're talking about theme restaurants, I got a proposition for you.  I think if white people are going to burn down black churches, then black people ought to  burn down the House of Blues.  Huh?  What a fucking disgrace that place is.  The House of Blues.  They ought to call it the House of Lame White Motherfuckers.  Inauthentic, low-frequency, single-digit, lame white motherfuckers. 
[01:35:30]  Especially these male movie stars who think they're blues artists.  You ever see these guys?  Don't you just want to puke in your soup with one of these fat, balding, overweight, over-aged,  out-of-shape, middle-aged male movie stars with sunglasses jumps on stage and starts blowing  into a harmonica?  It's a fucking sacrilege.  In the first place, white people got no business playing the blues ever, at all, under any circumstances. 
[01:36:00]  Ever, ever, ever.  What the fuck do white people have to be blue about?  Banana Republic ran out of khakis?  Huh?  The espresso machine is jammed?  Hootie and the Blowfish are breaking up?  Shit, white people ought to understand their job is to give people the blues, not to get  them. 
[01:36:30]  And certainly not to sing or play them.  Tell you a little secret about the blues.  It's not enough to know which notes to play.  You've got to know why they need to be played.  And another thing.  I don't think white people should be trying to dance like blacks.  Stop that!  Stick to your faggoty polkas and waltzes.  And that repulsive country line dancing shit that you do.  And be yourself.  Be proud.  Be white.  Be lame.  And get the fuck off the dance floor. 
[01:37:00]  Now, I thank you.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show, tip of the day on XM Radio.  Wayne from Fort Wayne, Indiana writes, I own an 87 Ford Mustang GT.  I'm wondering why the oil pressure gauge constantly registers low.  Will this have a negative effect on my vehicle's performance?  Wayne, will low pressure have a negative effect on your engine performance? 
[01:37:30]  Well, yeah.  And that the engine could seize up and stop running, never to run again.  Is that negative enough for you?  Have an oil pressure test performed with a mechanical gauge to determine if the engine  indeed has low oil pressure, or if it's just due to a bad oil pressure sensor or wiring  harness to it.  If you do have low oil pressure, you could do major damage to the engine in the form of  rod or main bearing damage, crank or cam damage, cylinder wall damage, or damage to anything  else that needs lubrication.

Moments after the Jimi Hendrix experience reduced the stage to ashes at the Monterey Pop Festival  in 1967, it was clear Jimi's incendiary guitar playing had finally converted the American audience  to his electric vision.  Jimi first took up the guitar in his early teens, religiously jamming to blues heroes Muddy Waters 
[01:39:00]  and Robert Johnson.  The Jimi Hendrix experience.  The Jimi Hendrix experience.  Shot Tracks.  FM 46.  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  Throw the first switch.  Sentence served.  Get ready.  Get set.  Permission to freak out.  Go!  O.B.  Where the talk of the industry is.  Anthony.  That's the way it's always been.  The outcast of radio. 
[01:39:30]  Bastards.  No one truly wants our radio show.  No one has balls anymore.  Your balls are showing.  Big, beefy, hanging, swinging nuts.  Throw the second switch!  Wow, this is even better than I imagined.  Love you, Alfie.  Love you, Anthony.  Boy, we're gonna have great fun.  Love you, Ben.  Love you, Steve.  I hope you brought a big bag of smiles.  O.A.  O.A.  You two are going to hell.  Shut up.  Kill yourself.  Throw the third switch!  O.A.  O.A., the virus is spreading. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, Black Biddy, Bambalam, yeah, Black Biddy, Bambalam, Black Biddy had a job, Bambalam,  damn thing gone well, Bambalam, she's always ready, Bambalam, she's on Rock City, Bambalam,  whoa, Black Biddy, Bambalam, yeah, Black Biddy, Bambalam.  All right.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  All of a sudden, you were really loud there now. 
[01:40:30]  I know.  Wow.  It's a work in progress.  Wow.  People are really starting to get pissed off that we've bitched this long.  And I apologize.  We just want to have everything set so we can, you know, do the show we know how to do.  Instant feedback, or whatever the hell we're allowed to call it, you can get to it through  opianthony.com and some other ways.  Are you guys wearing panties on your head like in weird science?  That's what it sounds like.  Yeah, with the whole technology thing.  Great.  And regarding Rodney Dangerfield, who died overnight, 82 years old, how cruel is the world when 
[01:41:00]  a genius and generally nice guy like Rodney is taken from us, and a retard like Carrot Top  is allowed to roam the earth?  Dial down the center.  Speaking of Rodney Dangerfield, XM Satellite Radio, XM Comedy 150, we'll be saluting Rodney  Dangerfield all day today with Rodney's segments every hour and an in-concert special tonight  at 8.  Hey, wang!  Right before our Richard Pryor special on XM Comedy 150.  I'm no doorknob either, alright? 
[01:41:30]  We'd like to play some Rodney Dangerfield clips today, but they're obsessed with George  Carlin.  I don't mind George Carlin because he's the greatest comic working right now, but how  about a bit that's a little different than the ones we heard yesterday, like Give Me  Three and White Male Movie Stars Play in the Blues.  Those are the exact same bits.  Yeah.  Let me say something about comedy.  I'm not an expert.  Part of the joy of a joke, it's contingent upon catching you off guard.  That's why comedians have to...  You can't just do your hits like you can as a singer. 
[01:42:00]  Songs are not contingent upon catching you off guard.  So you can hear a comedy bit you love six months later, a year later, you'll enjoy  it all over again.  But if you hear the same fucking bit that you heard yesterday, it's not going to make  anybody happy.  Wow.  Oh, man.  I am really uncomfortable now.  Well, the instant feedback is going crazy.  Everyone's like, you guys are playing a lot of George Carlin bits.  Does anyone know why?  Because there's one CD they have. 
[01:42:30]  George Carlin has a body of work that's 30 years old.  Yeah.  New rule.  New rule.  Because that other booth, the mics are so much louder because they're bitching about  Steve's mic still.  We've got to stop reading the instant feedback, but we're trying to adjust everything here.  New rule.  If you guys have something to say, come into the studio, you lazy F.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel's going to explain why we're just playing George Carlin bits.  Oh, okay.  There's a reason?  I think.  It can't be.  What we were told is that for these set breaks, you have to have a set bid for two minutes, 
[01:43:00]  three minutes, four minutes.  There's 20 of each, but for some reason, they're only rotating maybe six.  And we're getting phone calls when you guys are on breaks that when they hear the replays,  DC's programming Christmas music and all these other weird things that we're not doing in  the commercial breaks instead of what we had put together and gave them.  What do you mean Christmas breaks?  Oh, there's a guy online, too, said that he was hearing Christmas music during one of  our breaks.  He might be high or something. 
[01:43:30]  I can't believe all of the listeners.  Yeah.  John from Jersey, what's up, buddy?  Dude, two years, you guys ruined it.  Listen, man, I'm listening to the replay.  Yeah.  And there was like, between the stuff, there was like frickin' Charlie Brown, this music,  Disney, I don't know, it was like 1940s stuff.  And then they play the Red Peters, Blow Me, you know that tune?  Oh, yeah.  There's no lyrics in it.  It's just the backup and the frickin', I'm like, I'm listening to them, what the hell is  this?  Hmm.  They're just fucking it all out. 
[01:44:00]  It sounds like I'm listening to a fucking Don and Mike or something.  Oh, don't say that.  Oh, those guys are terrific.  Oh, don't say that.  And by the way, hey, thanks a lot, DC Snipers, you had those two fat cocks right there, you  couldn't have done them, instead of the bus driver.  Oh, love you, boo-boo.  Right in that fat gut.  All right.  All right, I'll change it all around today so it's gone.  How about a song, maybe, during a break?  Something that the listeners would like.  Why can't we just program the breaks?  Because we know what we're doing.  We know all the comedians we want to hear and what bits work. 
[01:44:30]  Apparently we're not allowed to.  Why?  That's what I was told.  We had to get this together and then give it to them and let them do it.  That's interesting.  Everything is pretty much taken out of our hands.  But half the stuff they're playing, when we take a quick break so we can try to take  a dump, which I haven't been able to do naturally in four days now, half the stuff they're playing  I don't find funny.  And if it's the Opie and Anthony show, I'd like to pick out all the stuff that I and  Anthony and Jim Norton find funny.  Yeah.  That junkyard graveyard crap, some of it's funny, but most of it stinks. 
[01:45:00]  Normally I would agree with you, but these are set to a certain length.  Like they have to be exactly at a certain length.  So there's some other bits.  Oh, that's it, Opie.  See, instead of it being funny or something, it's time sensitive.  But you guys could do the same thing with the length, because you're very qualified to  look and go, all right, that's three minutes, stop.  Why do they think that above, like, Maryland, we can't hit stop after three minutes?  I say we.  I wouldn't be a part of that.  Why can't they in Washington just throw the whole show to us right here in the studio, 
[01:45:30]  and then we'll play everything from, you know, like old school radio.  From right here.  We'll get the cart machines out and the CD players, and I'll put breaks together.  I'll make some calls.  I'll see what we can do.  Some music, maybe?  Why don't we even go to Washington if we're not even playing commercials?  We're going all the way down there so they can take it for a while while we go take leaks  so they can play PSAs and bits that are timed out perfectly.  But they're timed out perfectly, but they're not funny.  We have to figure out the logistics.  See, the number one priority of those things should be funny before it times out perfectly. 
[01:46:00]  Like, I don't understand the logic of that.  I don't understand that we have 20 of each timed bit, and they were playing only the  same six over and over.  Where are the others that we gave them?  The beauty of doing satellite radio, you know, you're listening to this, and you're not  going to have to listen to 10 to 20 minutes of commercials in a break.  Yeah.  In a row, excuse me.  But we could play funny stuff for these people.  Yeah, why can't we just do it from here?  I mean, the George Carlin thing was funny, but I've heard that three or four times now. 
[01:46:30]  Well, how about a song once in a while?  We've only been on the air three days.  You could toss in a Metallica song or Ozzy or Kiss or whatever.  I mean, whatever you want.  You don't have a commercial yet.  Someone just find out why we have to go to Washington if we're just playing.  I'd rather just talk the whole time, and when we need to take a break, I'll just put on  a Brian Regan or a Bill Hicks bit.  When it's over, we'll be back on the air.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  We'll see what we can do.  And then if they finally sell this crap they call the O&A show to some sponsors, then we'll  take it to the next level, right?  Right. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  Yeah, I don't get it.  We should be able to just do it from here.  You know who would know the answer?  A man like Tony Danza.  Awful.  It was bad.  It was bad.  I watched 30 seconds of that show yesterday, and I wanted to put my fist in the television.  He was ready to break the television.  It is nothing worse than watching an ex-boxer try to be charming for fat whore housewives.  Just be yourself.  You're a mean dago.  That's what you do.  Yeah, I saw about five minutes of it yesterday when you were watching, and he was telling 
[01:47:30]  this story, and then he mentioned his daughter's test scores or something.  It was just the most.  It was the most.  He was very proud that she got a hundred.  It's like, this is one thing I love about Colin is how much he hates applause breaks  in comedy, and it's like there's nothing worse than watching somebody go for an applause  break.  Yeah.  What are people going to do when you say my kid got a hundred?  Boo.  Now you've got to applaud. 
[01:48:00]  And the people that are forcing that applause out of you, like, yeah, well, I've got to  tell you, I just celebrated my 10-year wedding anniversary, and then they stop and pause  and wait for people to clap.  Let's just say what you're really meant to say.  I celebrated 14 years without a drink or a drug in my body, sober by the grace of God,  and I have two daughters.  All right, Rich.  Well, that's what's happening on TV and regular radio. 
[01:48:30]  It's all about safe programming.  Yeah.  It's garbage.  It is absolute shit.  What is this?  Oh, oh, oh.  Man, I saw an old episode of this show the other day, Who's the Boss, and that, uh, what's  her name?  The girl?  Alyssa Milano.  Alyssa Milano.  It's so filthy watching that show when she's a little kid like that, because you just know  what a babe she turned into.  Yeah.  So you watch it, and she's, what, friggin' nine years old or something? 
[01:49:00]  And you can't help but look and go, yeah.  She's going to be a slut in a few more years.  You know what she turned into?  Ava Save-A-Lot.  Those big, juicy cans she's got.  Yeah, but I...  Oh, so you're saying you like to, like, whack your bag watching her when she's lying, picturing  what she's going to be.  Well, no, I don't whack my bag watching the program, Jimmy.  I might try that, but no, I haven't done that.  But it's filthy.  You watch it, and she's a kid, and you kind of feel dirty, because you know that she turns 
[01:49:30]  out to be, uh, really hot.  So you look at her with that knowledge of that hotness in your head, even though she's  a kid on the TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't get out of your head that she's, you know, really hot.  Yeah, it's kind of like when you watch The Champ and young Rick Schroeder is crying over  the body.  Do you realize how good his abs are going to be in a few years?  I hear you.  Well, sure.  That's, uh, what he's trying to say.  Another way to look at it that I completely wasn't looking at.  Blonde lad with tears. 
[01:50:00]  That was a nice, nice moment.  Get up, champ!  First movie I ever saw in the theater, by the way, was The Champ.  Really?  And I was embarrassed that I cried, yeah.  You were crying.  How old were you?  Oh, I was a little boy, maybe the same age as a little Ricky Schroeder.  I might have been five or six years older.  What was that, 73?  I was born in 68.  Uh, so I guess I was five or six.  And you cried?  I cried.  I blubbered.  I cried like a, like some grandmother.  Lil could act like a man!  I, I, my parents took me to, um, I think the first movie I ever went to was a drive-in 
[01:50:30]  movie.  Took me to see Bonnie and Clyde.  Oh, Gene Hackman.  Remember that movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Wait, I'm sorry, Warren Beatty, right?  Warren Beatty.  Warren Beatty.  But Gene Hackman was in it, too.  Yeah.  And, uh, I, I, uh, they took us to Arby's beforehand, and, uh, I filled up on some Arby's, and then  they take me to this movie, and I don't even know how old I was.  I was a little, little kid.  And I puked my Arby's all over my father's, uh, Rambler, uh, because the movie, it was, 
[01:51:00]  it was not a movie to take a kid to.  I mean, the, and, and like I'm saying, they were, you know, bad parents or something, smoking  during pregnancy and drinking and stuff.  We didn't know back then.  Yeah, sure.  Who could possibly think inhaling smoke would, uh, do anything?  But, uh, no, you don't take a kid to a movie like Bonnie and Clyde, and I just puked  all over the place.  It was awful.  If you're going to take a kid to see a movie, make it Nine and a Half Weeks, or Blue Lagoon,  or something, that little kid can get something out of you. 
[01:51:30]  Put them on your lap, you'll watch, you'll explain what's going on, and how it's not wrong.  And then when I was living out in California, my father, uh, takes me to, uh, him and his,  uh, his girlfriend at the time, and me, to the drive-in theater, to see, uh, Barbarella.  Oh, now that's a hot movie.  In the open, yeah, but you don't want to be sitting in between your father and his girlfriend.  Uh, why were you sitting in between them?  No, actually, I was by the window, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That clip you've seen in Midnight Cowboy, where they're drinking in little John Voight's in bed. 
[01:52:00]  But the opening credits start for Barbarella, and she's, uh, kind of silhouetted, but nude,  and, and, you know, she's dancing around and stuff, Jane Fonda, Hanoi Jane, and, uh, it was  really hot, and I'm, I'm trying not to breathe heavy, but I'm getting all worked up, so I'm  breathing heavy out of my nose, so I'm not like, you know, my father and his girlfriend  in the car, and I notice the whole side of the truck that I'm on, the windows are completely 
[01:52:30]  fogging up, and I'm all embarrassed, and I've got, I've got a boner, and it's, I'm breathing  heavy, and it was the most awful, awful situation to be in.  How embarrassing.  Too bad you weren't in a tree fort, you could have had that taken care of.  It's really embarrassing.  Oh, that's funny.  I tried to get my dad when I was a kid, we used to go to the drive-in, and I, one time  I tried to get him to take me to see Ursula Andrew in The Sensuous Nurse, but I said, no,  I don't think we should see that together. 
[01:53:00]  No.  Yeah, which is probably, look in hindsight, that was a wise decision.  My, uh, and then one time I go with, uh, my mother and her mother, which is, of course,  my grandmother, to, uh, uh, a movie to go see Saturday Night Fever.  And now I'm sitting there, and I think at that point I was sitting in between my mother  and my grandmother, and there it is, Tony Manero and his crew banging what's-her-face  in the backseat of the car on the Verrazano Bridge, pretty much raping her as she's in 
[01:53:30]  some drugged-out coma, crying, and I'm sitting there, and there's my old grandmother sitting  next to me.  It's just embarrassing, you know?  You get that feeling inside where you're all, you can't leave the situation, you just  want to grab down and pull the ejector seat and pop out of the roof of the building?  Awful.  Humiliating.  Very humiliating.  God, some trauma at the movies.  You can't watch Hardcore Sex with your grandmother sitting there.  No, and it was pretty, you know, that was pretty good back then.  Uh, it, it, you just brought up a memory.  I was driving to, um, Hardcore. 
[01:54:00]  You're happy, now you raccoon.  I was driving up to New Haven on, uh, I-95.  Yeah.  I told this story once before, and I'm driving with my grandma, and I think, uh, one of my  brothers or sisters, I can't remember anymore, and the car in the, in the, the right lane  was going really slow.  Yeah.  And you saw the lady's head bobbing up and down.  Oh, getting a little, uh, road head.  A little road head.  It's nice that we could say road head on satellite radio.  Yeah.  Regular radio, you can't say road head.  You just have to spend 15 minutes, uh, trying to describe it. 
[01:54:30]  So I'm checking it out, and my grandma was also checking it out, and turns to me and  gives me a smile, like, yeah, I know what's going on over there.  Ah!  She was like 88 at the time.  Is that the same one that tongued you?  Uh, yeah.  That you tongued?  No, I tongued her by accident, yeah.  Did you ever hear that, Jimmy?  He, he was kissing his grandmother goodbye or something, and, uh, he opened his mouth.  And, uh, and-  I was little, man.  He thought that, you, you kind of thought that's how you would kiss people?  Not grandma! 
[01:55:00]  Ugh!  Tongue kissing!  You were too, you were old enough to understand the open mouth French kiss concept, but not  old enough to understand who to use it on?  You don't give it to grandma.  I thought a kiss was a kiss.  I don't know.  Yeah, it certainly is.  She was like, close your mouth!  She had to tell him to close his mouth.  That would stick with me for a while.  I just want to say goodnight.  You ever see, uh, grandma boob?  Uh, no.  No.  That's pretty bad, too.  I remember one day grandma cooking, uh, I guess it was for Thanksgiving, some holiday, 
[01:55:30]  and I was over there, and she was in her little housecoat thing or something, and she, uh,  bent over, and I turned my head and caught a glance right down the front of her, her housecoat  thing, and just saw these old grandma, uh, breasts.  And then that stuck with me.  I was just horrified for, for years.  Like, then every time I went over there, all I could think about was how embarrassing  it was, and, and how awful it was to see, and try to get that image out of my head.  You had big nips?  No, they, I guess at some age. 
[01:56:00]  No, they were long.  A woman's, uh, uh, areoli pretty much just turned into the same color as the boob.  This pale, see-through, like, the visible woman model, kind of, you could see every  vein and organ pumping, translucent skin thing that happens to old people.  Like those phones, like, from eight years ago, the clear ones.  That you see all the wiring and inner working.  Yeah.  Your, your grandparents become, like, the visible models, where you could see their  organs, and their blue and red veins and stuff, and it's awful. 
[01:56:30]  And the breast was, it was just some, uh, breast, it was, it had no, no nipple to it  or anything.  And that stuck with me.  I like a larger, uh, areola.  A lot of guys don't like that, but I prefer-  Big flapjack?  I really-  Big hotcake?  Yeah.  Like someone just took mud and, pfff, squished it against the breast.  That's very sexy.  Big and dark.  I'm the pretty average guy.  I like average things.  I don't like those small Madonna ones that look like two buttons on those big-  Oh, does she have little teeny ones?  Oh, little teeny ones. 
[01:57:00]  I figure she does.  She's such a-  She's actually into Jewish mysticism.  I'd like to spit gum right in her lip-syncing face.  I'm so glad that fruit cup attacked her at that award show.  Elton John doesn't like lip-syncing.  Elton John went off, yeah.  Yeah.  Apparently, when you're giving head to another man, you can't lip-sync.  And it's very obvious.  Shut your faggot mouth, Elton.  I'm tired of him criticizing everyone.  And everything.  That's what he does now.  He just criticizes things.  This is why I'd like to kick him right in his recently knighted face.  Because he attacked Sam Kinison a few years ago.  So I'd like to congratulate Sam on being the first pig to ever host an award show because 
[01:57:30]  he did AIDS jokes.  And then all of a sudden, Eminem, who I love and who does AIDS stuff in his songs and trash  his gay people, what's he doing a couple years ago?  Oh, he's singing at the award show with him.  I guess it's how hot you are at the moment.  At the moment.  This fucking fruit cup.  He really irritates me.  That's pretty much what he does.  Well, remember his last controversy?  He was getting all upset at American Idol, saying it was a racist competition.  And it's been won by black people for two out of the three seasons.  Or what?  Two out of the four seasons?  Oh, because the person that he thought should win. 
[01:58:00]  And apparently the one who had the larger bulge didn't advance.  Ugh.  Shut your face.  Hey, let's go to the phones and talk to Teresa.  What's up, Teresa?  Oh, no.  I was just calling in to tell you that I'm one of your devoted female fans.  I was patiently waiting for you to come back on the air.  Oh, well, thanks for that.  There it is.  See, we do have some girls listening.  Are you keeping WOW alive out there?  I'm trying to.  When can I get my WOW stickers?  Ooh, you had to bring up that. 
[01:58:30]  Well, they promised me we would have that all set and ready to go, that system.  But we're still waiting.  Well, I think the...  We have the new WOW stickers, the new Opie and Anthony WOW stickers.  Basically, it is Whip Them Out Wednesday.  And basically, all those wows you've been seeing on the back of trucks all over the country,  that's something that Anthony and I started about seven or eight years ago.  And WOW simply means Whip Them Out Wednesday, the girls see the WOW,  and they'll drive up to you if they feel like it, and they'll WOW you as you're driving.  Yeah, all of a sudden you'll be driving.  And you won't know when, where it'll happen, but you glance over, 
[01:59:00]  and the girl that saw the WOW on the back of your vehicle could be right up next to you,  and she's flashing you.  You're going, whoa, what?  How did that happen?  Oh, yeah.  I had a WOW on my vehicle.  So the new WOW stickers look great, but we need a way to get them to the fans.  Yeah.  And I even said, look, I'll just get a P.O. box.  I'll put the P.O. box on my website or our website, opianthony.com,  and I'll stuff the envelopes with the WOW stickers.  I don't care.  I'll do it.  Do it yourself. 
[01:59:30]  I'll do it myself.  Grassroots.  They're like, no, we're going to take another 10 or 12 meetings,  and we'll figure out how we're going to do this.  Yeah.  Because XM does stand for extreme meetings,  and they will get the system in place,  and supposedly it was supposed to be up and running already,  where you, the fan, all you had to do was give them your address,  and they were going to give you WOW stickers.  Right.  That was supposed to happen at least two weeks ago.  Yeah, but who needs that, though?  It's stupid just to have, like, promotion for the show.  But I don't mind doing it.  I said, look, just mail up a bunch of WOW stickers.  I'll set up a P.O. box. 
[02:00:00]  I'll do it myself.  Yeah.  We really want to get this show rolling.  We're motivated for the first time in our careers to really, really go for it.  Actually motivated.  Opie Phil from Boston says,  when I was seven, I saw Grandma Box still haunts me today.  God, that's just got to be the worst, man.  How did he?  You don't want to see Grandma Box.  He's got to explain how he saw the Grandma's Box.  You know it's not Kemp.  It looks like Einstein's head. 
[02:00:30]  There's no reason to Kemp that.  It's unkempt.  At that point, it's a Dropbox.  I never understood how someone sexually assaults somebody.  Not that sexual assault is ever right with somebody.  But it's like, how angry are you at society when you see somebody that old and you can...  Oh, I know.  It's just awful.  Sometimes I watch the news and I'm like, there are just some really angry, angry people out there.  And you wonder how they could do some things.  Yeah.  A woman at a rest home or something. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, he'll hop on board, punch her in the face like eight times and just go to town on a woman in her 80s or something.  It's like, wow, that is some anger that has to come out of what?  What happens to you growing up that you have to do that to Grandma?  Well, I can understand the punch her in the face part because you're going to get stuck behind one of these bags of meat in the supermarket.  Well, at least that's a reason.  Buying their items, canned peas and diapers.  Step it up.  But when it comes down to the sexual assault thing, I just don't understand how you can translate that anger into using your junk. 
[02:01:30]  I don't understand how you can do that.  Yeah, because it's not about the hotness of it.  I know, but I've never been angry enough where I can function sexually with an 80-year-old.  The manner I am at someone, the less I can function...  I can't bang a girl when I'm angry at her.  Yeah.  I don't have, like, revenge sex.  I have it with somebody else.  Like, you know what I mean?  I go out and cheat.  That's how I get my anger out of my girlfriend at or whatever.  I'm awful.  I can't do anything to anything violent or even nasty to girls.  It's just not in my nature.  And then you see on the news, like, you know, go up and guys just, you know, smack around their girls and think that's kind of a cool thing to do. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, we're getting some Morse code in on the...  Are you hearing that?  Yeah, that was a little distracting.  I think they're communicating with each other.  Still kind of hearing that.  It's so hard.  You get into a conversation and you want to keep talking about something and then you're just distracted by some kind of noise now.  Any idea where that's coming from?  Somebody's cell phone is going off.  It's a cell phone? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, these G...  What are they?  No, it's not.  GSM cell phones make that kind of noise through the monitors.  So it's somebody's cell phone?  Somebody in the vicinity of these two studios has a cell phone that's going off.  Wow.  This is very interesting.  Let's go to Greg in Houston.  Can they hear that over the air?  We can...  I don't know.  It's really distracting.  Who knows?  Hey, Greg, what's up?  Jesus.  I can't hear it.  Greg.  No, I can't hear it.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  All right.  Cool.  Hey, yeah, you know, y'all went off the air right as I was starting to listen when I would travel up to the north. 
[02:03:00]  And so finally the jar back on and my wife's getting to see all this twisted information that y'all are starting to spew.  And I don't think she understands it quite well.  Uh-oh.  What?  Problems with the wife?  Yeah.  You know, I tried to get her to do the Whip Out Wednesday, and I tried to get her to, you know, I'm trying to get her to get the $1.99,  but, you know, it's kind of hard to sell it whenever she's hearing all this, the gay promos and the mics going up and down. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, I know.  We only have one shot at this, too, you know?  People are kind of trying out the show for the month of October, so that's why I'm a little freaked out here that, you know,  we need everything working perfectly because, you know, people are deciding if they're going to continue with the Opie and Anthony show on High Voltage 202.  Right.  After October's over.  Yeah.  That's why I'm in a panic and yelling and screaming and want everything working, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  You've got to get some good material out there so that people can, you know, bring in the new people who haven't ever heard you before. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, we've got to sell ourselves.  I mean, you know, we spend an hour and a half bitching about how everything's not working.  That's not really giving people a chance to like us.  No.  Yeah.  No, when that's all they're hearing.  We need to do really good radio shows, and then you, the consumer, will decide to keep listening to us.  That's how this works with the satellite radio.  All right, Greg.  Yeah, you've got your base.  Just keep up the good work.  All right, thank you.  That's why we're, you know, we're pushing so hard. 
[02:04:30]  We understand that we're only going to have one shot at this.  Yeah.  Speaking of Whippin' Matt Wednesday, yesterday we were talking about how the girl flashed on the Today Show Live.  Yeah.  It was part of our guerrilla campaign of getting our names out there.  It works.  Which started up again only a couple days ago.  Someone on Fox and Friends had an XM satellite radio opening to Anthony Banner,  and they've just pretty much disrupted their broadcast when they went out on the street.  Yeah.  So it has begun again. 
[02:05:00]  So we mentioned the wow on the Today Show.  You know, the girl's flashing her tits.  And also the C-word that made it on local TV here in New York City.  Yes, yes.  Well, OAVirus.com has those two video clips.  See, we're a very interactive radio show.  So if you were listening yesterday and you heard that break, well, you can see the video for yourself at OAVirus.com.  All right.  Okay.  Doughboy from Whack Bag saying two words, century sex.  Remember that one? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  We forgot all about that.  Talking about old ladies.  We were given a videotape called Century Sex, and this is...  And you know what?  That's another thing we weren't allowed to take out of our office when we got shown the door two years ago.  Good.  I wanted no part of that video.  Dude, that's...  It was actually a good attraction.  People that came in, guests and stuff, we'd bring them back to the office and screen it for them.  And it was horrific.  It was horrific.  All you would see is she had to be... 
[02:06:00]  Well, she was near 100.  I don't think she was 100, even though it was called Century Sex.  She was at least 90, though.  She was like 90 years old.  She had the body of E.T.  Her body was like E.T.  And this guy was having sex with her.  Barely.  And he could barely do it.  He could barely do it.  He couldn't get a plump.  This was filmed, obviously, before Viagra made its mark on society today.  Yeah, yeah.  Because this guy could barely get it going.  Oh, Viagra.  If he had Viagra, it would have killed the woman.  Her body, you know, gravity takes its toll. 
[02:06:30]  And she was all bunched up like all of her organs had fallen into her pelvis.  And she had this big, round, tired belly.  And her boobs drooped like right down to her belly button.  And a guy was doing her.  And it was on video.  I've never seen a movie turn 2,000 guys into one collective.  Remember at the Vanderbilt?  Oh, we actually played it at the Vanderbilt in front of 2,000 people. 
[02:07:00]  You guys played it at the road show.  I forgot about that.  At one of the road shows.  Yeah.  And it was awful.  You just heard the whole crowd, when she hit the screen, go,  Oh!  Well, we've got to get another copy of Century Sex.  Yeah.  That was a conversation starter.  Yeah, please, if someone has it, send it in to us.  We'll give you a wow sticker for it.  Okay.  All right, we're going to step aside again.  We're going to attempt to do that.  It should be coming naturally.  Finally, it's up to day four. 
[02:07:30]  I'm going to go to the store and get some...  What's wrong here?  Jimmy is all upset again.  No, no, no.  The third time the coffee water gets fucked up, who cares?  I'll just go to the store and get it myself.  What are you looking for?  I'm not asking anybody to get me anything anymore.  I'm very independent.  I'll do it myself.  What did you need?  I only drink...  I asked for a bottle of water.  I didn't get that.  And a medium iced latte with soy milk.  And what is that?  It's not from Starbucks.  It's from this other company.  And it tastes like somebody dropped a log and put ice on it.  It stinks. 
[02:08:00]  Why didn't they get your Starbucks?  Because that would be easy and correct.  Why would they?  Why are we all so angry?  There's a lot of anger in here today.  Is it because we're not really sleeping yet?  We're not sleeping.  We're not sleeping.  And I do realize I'm very cranky today because I'm not sleeping in my nose and stuff because  I told you I took that Levitra last night to get my hand...  So that ruined my nose so I shot Zycam and now I can't breathe.  So I know I'm in a bad mood.  That's why I wasn't going to say anything.  But, you know, someone just caught me making a face at this dog shit with ice in it. 
[02:08:30]  I hate iced lattes that aren't Starbucks.  And I'm not whoring for Starbucks.  But they're the only ones I want to drink.  A lot of people now will only drink Starbucks coffee.  What about the mom and pop places?  Their coffee is burnt and it sucks.  This is what you get when you go somewhere else.  I don't want some Arab, some uncut savage making my latte.  I want a nice white or black or Spanish American kid making it with a smile on his face and  fucking it up, calling it a medium grande.  Fuck you.  Get me a medium with soy milk, sissy boy. 
[02:09:00]  But I only drink Starbucks.  Okay.  Oh, I know that the young anarchists are not going to like that.  You know, they broke Starbucks windows during the World Trade Organization.  Corporate America.  Yeah, Starbucks.  That's real balls.  Go after the coffee makers, you little anarchy jerk-offs.  Hey, Yankees lost and the Red Sox won last night.  Ah, yeah.  No, it's all right.  I'm just busting on you, bro.  No, no.  I think it's good that the Yankees lost and the Red Sox won. 
[02:09:30]  Get those dirty Boston.  I love when they feel good because the better they feel.  Hey, Curt Schilling looked great last night.  I hope Curt Schilling gets elbow cancer.  Curt Schilling's going to win the Red Sox, the World Series, finally.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  Come on.  What?  Jim Rice couldn't do it.  Yastrzemski couldn't do it.  Clemens couldn't do it.  Mo Vaughn couldn't do it.  Curt Schilling is going to get the job done.  Are you saying that this is Boston's year?  This is the year.  This is the year.  I know I've said that in the past, but this is our year.  You say it every year, and you're insane.  Wait a second.  That year I predicted the Patriots would win the Super Bowl. 
[02:10:00]  You said, oh, no, no, no, and we won the Super Bowl.  Patriots are different.  Yeah, but it's different.  I know, but this is my prediction.  Mark my words, we're going to win the World Series.  Do you realize the last time someone said Boston won the World Series last year,  if you said Hitler, they'd go, who are you talking about?  Right.  1918.  I mean, come on, dude.  There's something wrong with the organization.  Yeah.  Six years prior, the Titanic sunk.  Well, what was wrong with the organization for many years is that they didn't like black  people on their team.  What's your point?  The Red Sox. 
[02:10:30]  They still don't.  They're all Dominicans.  How many black stars do they have in Boston in the last few years?  Mo Vaughn they chased out.  I mean, with Jim Rice.  I mean, there are very few.  Pedro, they're all Dominicans.  Manny Ramirez.  I don't have any black guys in Boston.  So, all right, you know, you can take it.  That's why the curse, though.  All the other teams were getting the Darkies and the Red Sox.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  What?  What kind of...  What?  Do your research.  Do my research?  What?  Is it 1958?  I didn't say colored.  Jeez.  They did a whole show on it where the freaking owners of the Red Sox were racist and they 
[02:11:00]  didn't want the Darkies on their team.  That would be an anthracite show.  So everyone else was, you know, scooping up the Darkies for their teams and they were  winning the World Series.  Is that what they were calling black people in Boston?  It wasn't a freaking...  It wasn't...  Pretty much.  We're calling them Darkies.  It wasn't a curse.  They didn't want the best players on their team because they were racist.  When did the studio get moved to Southie?  Really?  Oh, my God.  I saw a whole show on this.  I think it was HBO on the curse.  Fucking dense.  And they were explaining that it's really, you know, for many years it wasn't a curse. 
[02:11:30]  They just weren't getting the best players because the team owner was a racist.  Yeah, but they had a 4-0 lead last year with a fine...  Yeah, there is just a...  It's a curse.  It will just always fall.  They will always fall on their faces.  They will always choke when push comes to shove and the pressure is really on and they  look like they're ready to win, that's when they choke the worst and it's over and...  Go Sox.  Yeah, another...  Yankee sir of chanting Yankee Sox.  I'm not jumping on the Yankee bandwagon.  Not bandwagon. 
[02:12:00]  Even though I'm from New York.  I'm a Mets fan.  Hey, look, I'll tell you.  And I'll always be a Mets fan, which pisses off the Red Sox fans even more, but I'm going  for the Sox this year.  Look, Boston's one of my favorite cities.  Boston, they have great basketball, fantastic football.  You want to shoot your pregnant wife in the stomach and have a black guy blamed?  That's where you go.  Oh, Chuck Stewart reference there.  That's good.  Of course.  Well, Charles, I don't call him Chuck.  That's a little too familiar.  That's how you know Boston's a little racist, though, because he just said a black guy did.  They're like, round him up, shoot him!  There wasn't even a question of maybe it was a black guy. 
[02:12:30]  That was a great one.  What was that guy's name?  Oh, they...  Willie something?  Yeah, they...  If he just would have waited, and then he could have jumped off a beautiful bridge now instead  of...  Yeah, that nice new bridge.  The old Tobin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, so there you go.  Yankees lost.  Red Sox.  Yeah.  And by the way, that's another proof that Steinbrenner...  Can you stop going after hitting?  Because it's...  I mean, even though Mussina was okay last night, but it's pitching.  It's never hitting in the playoffs.  Well, the...  By the way, if I ever make such a fucking boring point on radio again, somebody smacked  me in the face.  You're trying to go to break, and I'm just... 
[02:13:00]  The Twins had a couple of great plays and stuff last night.  Yeah, and one more double play.  Stole it away from the Yankees.  Yeah, the Yankees gave it away.  Double play after double play after fucking double play.  Yeah, I was so irritated.  So when does your body adjust so you can take dumps in the morning?  I...  You know, it's funny you should say that.  Apparently, whoever makes this coffee doesn't have a problem.  I am...  I am like...  This is just...  Well, you had a fun-filled night, Opie, from what I heard.  Yeah.  We don't need to tease things on satellite radio, because, you know... 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, they're either here or they're not.  Right.  So, yeah, I'll talk about my night last night.  I almost had to break out a coat hanger.  Ah!  Something.  I just need my...  I just need my body clock to adjust to these crazy hours that we decided to do.  A coat hanger, huh?  Oh, man.  What happened?  What'd you do?  Well, we gotta play another George Carlin bit.  Okay.  Oh, God, no, please.  I want a prank phone call instead.  Let's go ahead and prank phone call.  Look, Jakey.  I'm thinking maybe a dice bit. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know what we're doing, but I'll be at Starbucks.  I'm gonna go get my own stuff.  I'm not sending anybody out anymore.  Are you actually going down to Starbucks yourself?  I'm gonna walk right by that uneducated drunkard who watches the...  I'm gonna go walk right by...  That guy's an ex-con, by the way, that's watching the building.  Well, I don't care.  When we show up at really 30 in the morning.  I'm Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  You say what you want, convict.  Great.  Get me in trouble.  Was that the guy that was sleeping when I came up?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  That's what he does best.  Why was he a convict?  Was he in the getaway car and he dozed off while they were robbing the bank? 
[02:14:30]  Lazy motherfucker.  All right.  Sticks.  What happened to the bottled water?  We ever get stacks?  Stacks.  That was his name.  I was actually thinking of the Happy Days episode.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  That's what a bunch of bisexuals with guitars were supposed to drive from the job.  I stink.  Okay.  Let's play another comedy bit.  Great.  Maybe a PSA.  Still waiting for our first sponsor to join the Opie and Anthony show.  What is that guy's problem? 
[02:15:00]  Nothing.  I think you should just put a little wig on him and watch him work at a chocolate factory.  Old Oompa Loompa body.  Wear this green hair, motherfucker.  Do-pa-dee-doo.  I've got a smaller studio for you.  We're not making new friends, guys.  We're not making new friends.  Oh, my God.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  Well.  You are so bad, man.  Oh, I'm so cranky.  I don't care.  You understand?  I got a hand job last night.  I took a little picture for a prostitute.  Hold on.  We're going to talk about that next.  All right.  I'll be back in another 40 minutes.  I'm going to grab coffee.  No, get to someone else again.  We only have three minutes.  No, it's gotten messed up every time I've sent somebody.  Now, my egg sandwich is going to be nice and cold by the time I eat it.  Give it one more try.  Give him one more shot. 
[02:16:00]  No, because he's going to hate my guts and start spitting in my drink.  I know what he's going to do.  I've seen roots.  I know what happens when you don't like somebody.  You just stir it up and you get it back to them.  I don't know anyone named Kizzy.  You know what's funny, Jim?  It's only your order that keeps getting screwed up.  Well, you know I'm not making it up, Ben.  I'm not going.  I don't know how yours keeps getting screwed up.  Has anybody else had a problem today?  Not really ordering anything as complex as a coffee.  Sort of.  But I'm trying to be nice today.  It's kind of hard to screw up a banana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's true. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  No, just send someone else because we've got to hear your story next.  Okay.  Because then I'll tell you my story.  All right.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Hit the, uh, is it a break?  Is it a whatever it is?  All right.  I was walking down the street and some construction guy was shouting at me, hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly. 
[02:17:00]  A public service announcement of the O.B. and Anthony show.  Yeah, you need a driver there, buddy.  Who's this?  This is Jake calling about the job, driving.  I saw it in the paper.  Yes.  Yeah, well, you still need a driver or what?  Uh, did you feel an application with us, Jake?  Pardon me?  Huh?  Speak up there.  What did you say?  You feel an application with us?  No, no, no, no.  Look, I saw it he had in the paper and I'm calling you, fruitcake.  I'm looking for a job driving a truck.  We're looking for movers. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, well, that's what I do.  What class driver's license do you have?  I got five, one, two, three, four.  I got them all.  Yeah, class one?  Yeah, I drive buses, trucks.  I'll back a truck through the fucking, uh, two-family house garage.  One of those big two-ton trucks.  When was the last time you drove a truck to trailer?  Oh, jeez, what the fuck?  I'd say about two weeks ago, I robbed one down in Jersey and I drove it up here to New York.  Fucking flying.  Drove it through the tolls, no stopping, no nothing.  I'm good. 
[02:18:00]  I see.  Why don't you call, uh, call back on Monday?  Hey, I'll tell you what.  I come in, I'll take you for a test spin.  How's that?  We go out and we take the truck around the fucking block.  I speed, I pop wheelies.  I'm good, baby.  Call back on Monday, I'll talk.  All right, can I get you?  I want you.  You sound good.  You and me.  We make a team.  You drive with me.  All right?  What's your name again?  Jake.  Jake, who did you work for, Jake?  Oh, jeez, I worked for Moish, I worked for, uh, Madeflower, you know?  Oh, yeah, don't, hey, I was good with them, too. 
[02:18:30]  You worked with Moish's?  Yeah, that's right.  When?  Eh, about, what, two years ago?  See, when I got a problem there, they get fucking scared when I pop the wheelies and all that shit.  You know, I pop a lot of wheelies, I'm good with that shit.  You know, I don't break no merchandise, see?  I get it there two hours ahead of time, all the time.  What do you say?  I say, if you pop any wheelies there, I'm not even going to put in your position.  Ah, listen to me, I don't break nothing, sizzle chest.  I'm good.  Okay, come Monday, we'll set up an interview, okay? 
[02:19:00]  All right, I'll do that there, Rubberneck.  I'll call you Monday.  Okay.  All right, fruitcake, see you later.  Where the Surfers Go.  Next is SpamSlicer.com presents Megabyte Minute.  Thanks for tuning in.  I'm David Radin on XM Satellite Radio.  Many people want to know where internet users most often surf.  CEOs, marketing and advertising companies, as well as parents, could use this information to their benefit. 
[02:19:30]  It might help when deciding where to place ads, or what might be seen by children while using the web.  In a study performed by Hitwise, a web tracking firm, numbers show that the category with the most traffic is adult-oriented websites.  With over 18% of the pie, adult entertainment even beat up the search engine category for the number one slot.  Best in Google, Yahoo, and MSN Search all together. 
[02:20:00]  I'm David Radin.  More at MegabyteMinute.com  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray.  One couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Good morning.  Based on a dare from radio hosts here in New York.  Hello.  They fired these two guys for orchestrating an obscene stunt in New York's most famous Catholic cathedral. 
[02:20:30]  Shock Jocks Opie and Anthony had encouraged to coupled out sets of locations where producer was waiting to call in the play-by-play.  Opie and Anthony were fired, and their nationally syndicated show canceled.  Did these Shock Jocks simply go too far?  When they crossed the line.  This is outrageous.  Oh, dear.  What are you, stupid?  Huh?  Just when everything was going good.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I like yambangs on the tool.  I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender. 
[02:21:00]  Broadcast an outrageous live account of a couple allegedly having sex right in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day of obligation.  Presided over the slaughter of a wild pig.  Closed down San Francisco's Bay Bridge.  Encourged teenage girls to run naked.  And invited listeners to compare the taste of eggnog and urine.  Scorn everything up.  Shock Jocks.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form.  It murdered these people to actually have it as a set-up.  No crap, Sherlock.  Die. 
[02:21:30]  Die.  Die.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I've got another puzzle for you.  Boom-pa-boom-pa-doom-pa-dee-dee.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  You got me with a mouthful of bagel.  It's all right. 
[02:22:00]  At least I'm not the only one eating.  The volumes are still messed up.  Steve, when it goes to you in there, the volumes is still too low.  When you're doing the promo, it's too low.  So people are turning up their radios and then they're getting blasted out still.  When I tell you that it looks completely even, and I just got done telling the XM people like this,  they're looking completely even.  So I can't figure out where the problem is.  The problem is it's not even with the volume in here.  There's got to be a better way to just balance everything out.  They just called me from D.C. and said that they raised your level in there more. 
[02:22:30]  And that should have evened it out, but evidently that didn't even help.  No, but your level is the one that's been too low.  What, the promo level now is too low?  I thought that was screaming hot before.  Well, maybe yesterday it was.  I don't know.  I can only hear on one side.  I'm telling you, it's only coming out of one channel on that side, and that's why we're not getting it.  No, Jim, your headphones are only getting one channel.  They just told me they're going to fix it.  Right now, Opie's in the right channel, and Steve C's in the left.  They're going to fix that after the show.  They've got to get under the console and rewire some stuff. 
[02:23:00]  According to my levels in here, Steve, when you talk, you're barely registering.  I'm right around where you are on my levels.  You're way down here, and we're way up there.  So I don't know what the people are hearing out there.  My views are way up, are right in line with yours, as I'm speaking right now.  So weird.  Can't hear Norton.  Steve is too loud, is what Doughboy is saying.  Can you hear me now?  Hey, Denise, what's going on? 
[02:23:30]  Hey, guys, how are you?  Pretty good.  Hey.  What I want to know is why Jimmy Norton is acting more like J-Lo than the guy who got  replaced by the old guy on Last Comic Standing with the hat that said, did you poop today?  What do you mean?  J-Lo.  You say why does Jim Norton act more like J-Lo?  I'm not sure what you mean.  You're acting like a diva.  I'm a J-Starbuck.  Listen to me, stupid.  I'm not being a diva.  But when I want a medium iced soy latte, I want a medium iced soy latte. 
[02:24:00]  And you're like, boo-hoo, I have to go to Starbucks myself.  Take off your skirt.  That's not boo-hoo, by the way.  If I say I'm going to go to Starbucks myself, that's what a man does.  You don't send somebody out to get your coffee.  I don't like other people.  You guys probably put his dick in my coffee.  He hates my guts.  I hope not.  Okay.  Thank you, Denise.  Oh, that guy's hot under the collar about something.  Oh, he's hot.  Anthony, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  Welcome back, fellas. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, thank you.  First off, with your FU lives are early working, I want to tell Mike Messina,  there's a reason why you win games in the regular season.  Is that when you get to the postseason, you win those two, you son of a bitch.  All right.  Sorry about that.  I'll do that.  You guys are talking about grandmothers naked?  Yeah.  I got the orders.  I was eight years old, and I saw my great-grandmother on all fours getting wiped.  I saw my mother and my aunts.  Very nice.  Your phone sounds like a wave file.  Getting wiped.  No.  Like a wave file. 
[02:25:00]  No.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Your phone's not that good to put it on the air, unfortunately.  Shut up.  Stop, man.  Oh, wow.  And Doughboy is saying, stop eating.  You meaty-breasted nothing.  Why you got to talk to me like that, man?  It's hurtful.  That's what he says.  I guess people hear you eating again.  That's all.  Sorry.  Not that he shouldn't be able to eat a full meal in two minutes and 48 seconds while  re-listening to a Jerky Boys bit.  I mean, you know, who shouldn't be able to enjoy it? 
[02:25:30]  There is such anger, man.  There is such anger in here today.  Well, it's just frustrating.  We got to work all the bugs out.  It really is.  We were feeling pretty good yesterday.  It's kind of tough to work out all the bugs in front of everybody, though.  Yeah.  Weren't we feeling good yesterday?  Yeah.  Remember how good we were feeling about ourselves?  But the problem was, that's why we went off today.  I thought we had a really good show yesterday, and then I was reading all the email that comes  in to me, and people were really frustrated.  At the levels, yeah.  The levels were really bad, you know, whatever.  The problem is, no one wants to complain. 
[02:26:00]  We love being here.  But once you say, like, hey, look, can we fix this?  You just want to get a fix so the show is better.  That's all it is.  Nobody, you know.  Hey, Kevin from New Rochelle.  What do you got?  Hi, guys.  Good to see you again.  Just a couple of things.  First two days were a little rough.  Today's a hell of a lot better.  I think I could have put together a better show the first two days with the sound boards  I got from Foundry.  Yeah, well, we're still not confident enough to start using our instant replay and stuff.  No.  We got to get all the levels figured out.  We got to get the compression right. 
[02:26:30]  I think we need new microphones in here.  We got to make a list.  Yep.  These are unidirectional mics, and that's the other problem.  If Norton moves away from the mic, it drops completely out.  Like, he needs an omnidirectional mic.  We always worked with microphones that took in the noise of the room.  So, it works much better for us.  It says the callers are really low.  That guy's screaming.  I could barely hear.  Well, then the level thing.  You might as well take this machine, open that window, and throw it on 57th Street.  I'd be really happy to do that.  Because I'm riding the levels, and that's not helping, I guess. 
[02:27:00]  I guess the callers have to be really loud.  All right.  I'll crank them up, and we'll see what happens with that.  All right, Jim.  So, what happened last night?  Well, as you all know, I'm a frightened, lonely man.  So, I have a massage girl that I wanted to see, and I canceled my spot at the comedy show.  It was going to be too late.  So, I'm like, what am I going to do from 7 o'clock to like 9.30?  And I had her come over, and I took a Levitra, because that's how bad I am.  It's like, I feel like my dick has to be rock solid for a massage girl who I'm paying. 
[02:27:30]  What's the difference between a Levitra or a Viagra?  Well, funny you should ask, Ant.  Levitra doesn't destroy your nose as bad.  And Viagra gives you, like when I was in Brazil, it makes you congested.  Horribly congested.  Like, when I was in Brazil, I was doing 100 milligrams of Viagra a day, which is, like, that will keep you hard four days after you're dead.  And then just banging three hookers in a row.  I went banging three hookers in a row in Brazil.  So, coming back, I got Levitra, and it doesn't make your nose as stuffed, and it gives you a nicer erection. 
[02:28:00]  I like it better.  Nicer?  In what way?  It's more juicy?  Yeah, it's going to look better.  And it's easier to finish with.  I couldn't bust on 100 milligrams of Viagra.  You can't bust.  You're hard for hours.  Yo, you can't bust, yo.  Well, yeah, I'm trying to say it nice.  Bust a nut, yo.  Now, maybe I just can't hear myself talking, but I can't hear out of these headphones.  Yeah, you've got to get closer to the mic again, too.  No, no, I can't hear out of the headphones.  Great.  Great.  Now, I can hear that, but I can't hear that. 
[02:28:30]  So, we'll put them there.  We'll just talk.  And so, the massage girl comes over last night, and I can't breathe because I took the Levitra,  which makes my nose stuffy, so I pop Zycam.  What is that?  It's a nose spray, which clears you up.  Oh, okay.  You know what a fucking mess I am?  Wow.  You would medicate a lot for somebody that doesn't do drugs.  No, none of them are narcotics.  None of them are narcotics.  That's why my nose is stuffy today. 
[02:29:00]  So, I took Zycam last night, and then I slept.  None of them are narcotics, but do you realize you could have some kind of dependency, some  chemical dependency to get hard-ons with medication?  No, no, no, no.  I just wanted it to be particularly lovely while she was here.  For what reason?  So, she'd look at it and not be able to ignore it?  Because nothing is worse when you're getting a massage than hoping she gets the hint.  But, you know what I mean?  You want to be firm, because if it's just laying there like a paraplegic slug, she's going to  think you're not interested, and she's not going to touch it. 
[02:29:30]  Okay.  So, you have to be ready.  You have to be physically, you know, you've got to be erect.  Was it an Asian girl?  No, I don't mess with the Asians.  The only time I ever did an Asian, they bug me with their submission and their stupid,  they're just awful.  They do nothing for me.  You want a take charge kind of gal?  No, I just want somebody that doesn't have the same dumb, deadpan look on her face,  whether she's smiling, happy, or indifferent.  You can never tell how Asians feel.  Stupid plastic Halloween mask faces.  They don't make any expressions.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ, could you be a person?  I'm not being mean. 
[02:30:00]  I got one in a massage parlor.  I went in this place in Jersey, and I'm banging her, and she's got her stupid eyes closed,  I think.  You can never really tell.  Are your eyes closed, or are they wide open with surprise?  I can't tell.  There's only an eighth of an inch difference.  You're a rotten P.O.W. torturing whore.  And she's looking the other way while I'm on top of her.  She's got her eyes closed, and she's looking the other way.  I'm like, I'm not expecting you to enjoy this, but could you at least not act like you're  paying off a slave ship debt?  For Christ's sake, how awful. 
[02:30:30]  She just looked horrified.  Not even horrified, just like she was in pain.  She didn't want to be there.  It was actually an honest expression.  That's how you should look if I'm on top of you with my fat tits dangling over your  $100-making face.  Yeah.  But they don't do anything for me, the Asians.  They don't do anything for me.  Wow.  Okay.  Sorry.  No, everyone's got their own little tastes and stuff.  You're like, I touch.  You're like, you touch.  No, I don't.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you like?  Like, what race is good for you? 
[02:31:00]  American Indians, women, I love them.  Because they, where the hell do you find them?  Where the hell do you find one of those?  Where are you?  New Mexico for a horse?  I don't know how easy they are.  You just got to drive down the street with a bottle hanging out the window.  No, I like them because.  Hang out outside the casinos.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, is that where you're going to be?  I like larger, as you guys all know, I like larger, I'm not even being nasty, I like larger  lips in certain areas.  I like larger lips.  And Native American women have that, that's a big.  They do, like a big buffalo.  Wait, wait, where do you find the Native American women in New York City? 
[02:31:30]  You really don't find them anywhere.  But when I hear a girl say that she's part American, thank you, buddy.  When I hear a girl say she's part American Indian, I'm like, I know she's going to have  like, you know, camel toe you can see through her comforter.  And that's what I prefer.  Like you like to say, you want it to look like a chimp's face.  Yeah, I like the type of vagina that could just as easily fit onto a brontosaurus.  Just, like when you pull your panty aside, I actually want it to flop out and go like  this.  I want to hear it. 
[02:32:00]  I want to hear your droopy, like when you, I like when a girl tells me, like, you know,  I was so embarrassed to get dressed in front of other girls in high school, I had to face  the locker.  I get clear stuff coming out when I hear this.  Really?  Yeah, because I know it's just a big, meaty mess.  You like that?  I love that.  You like it to look like Abner Louima with his head turned sideways?  I understand.  Oh, I really like it.  Yeah, I want it to look, I want it to look like it just got punched.  Jesus, who just punched you in the vag? 
[02:32:30]  You're swollen.  Yeah, I like that.  Like you get a cold compresses for her at a, just concerned.  Like, I want it to look like her vagina just smoked an exploding cartoon cigar.  To me, that is sexy.  That's hot.  Okay.  Oh, that's hilarious.  So now you got this girl, this massage girl, and you have a raging one because of the Levitra.  Levitra.  Which, by the way, the Levitra commercials are awful.  Isn't it with the one with the guy and his wife or girl or whatever it is, and she goes, 
[02:33:00]  it gives him more, what does she call it?  She doesn't even call it like a hard-on or something.  Of course not.  That would be honesty in advertising.  No, you're not going to say that.  Yeah.  Because he gets a better erection.  It gives him more pep.  More quality.  That is, it gives him a quality erection that he's looking for.  Do they say erection, though?  No, not even.  No, they're androgynous words that could mean anything.  Yeah, really, it's awful.  And the guy just looks like, oh my God, you just know what was happening before he got the Levitra. 
[02:33:30]  Like, she's just completely unsatisfied.  He's got a limp noodle between his legs.  And she's looking at the pool boy.  That's how they should sell Levitra, by the way.  They should show, like, a really strapping young black guy with a white chick, and they  should say, are you tired of this happening?  Take this pill, you Eastern European fairy.  So you get her, you're all juiced up on the Levitra.  Oh, yeah, and it looked really good.  It did? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Very proud of you.  Oh, yeah, fantastic.  And so she starts, you know, tugging.  And then she's like, you want to fuck?  Wow.  And I'm like, yeah.  That's pretty forward.  Yeah, I like that.  She wasn't a shy girl.  Chinese girl never would have said that.  No.  She would have closed her eyes.  You know, whatever I wanted to do would have been satisfactory.  Wow, she asked you if you wanted to.  Great.  In Japan, actually, they came out with the man pillow arm.  You know what that is?  No, what is that?  Oh, I saw that in the paper the other day. 
[02:34:30]  It's a pillow.  Well, it's a pillow, and it has a man's arm, so the lady could kind of like, you know, cuddle it.  What?  Yeah.  It's a pillow, but it has like a man's arm with a white glove on it, which is odd.  I guess that's perfect in case you're a kid and you want to feel like you're being molested by a pop star.  It has a white glove on the arm, but you sleep on it, and I guess it feels like you're being cuddled.  What lonely person is getting this?  I really, how codependent are you?  Did you say a pillow with arm, alcoholic father not included? 
[02:35:00]  Why would anybody want to sleep like there's somebody else there?  How about a pillow that wipes itself off and leaves as soon as you're finished?  Stupid Asian.  That's horrible.  Oh, what Asian people are using this?  I've never heard of this.  It was one of those stupid Japanese inventions.  Yeah.  They come up with all those stupid inventions over there.  And you know what the really depressing part is Bob Dole's wife ran out and got one.  Oh, wow.  She wakes up with pen writing all over her every morning as he tries to grope her. 
[02:35:30]  Bob Dole doesn't like it when you pull away from Bob Dole.  Speaking of Levitre, that's why he took it for his arm.  Wow.  The Viagra he used to sell.  He was the Viagra sponsor.  Yeah, he was the Viagra whore.  That's right.  Don't you love uncensored radio?  Sure.  All the other DJs out there can't talk like this.  But their equipment works.  Yeah, their equipment works.  But they can't say what they want to say.  Oh, it's the commercial radio.  I've done it all over the country.  Because they're in chains.  The FCC has them in chains. 
[02:36:00]  How's your coffee, Jimmy?  I see you just got your Starbucks.  My medium iced latte from Starbucks.  I want to thank the fine young strapping buck that ran out and got it.  It was very nice.  And I know I've been a real prima donna dick today.  I apologize.  Part of it is I am very tired and I'm very not used to this game.  Yeah, we're all kind of freaking about this.  So how many nuts did you blow last night?  One.  Oh, but I did blow another one.  What was his name?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
[02:36:30]  Two days on the air.  He is already working it.  That's why we didn't put a computer in front of him.  I'm smart.  He used our program to get laid so much.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  And then the two years that we were on, I don't know how well a tough crowd worked for you getting laid.  Gee, not that Colin and those camel legs, as Bob Kelly calls them, doesn't attract a lot of women.  You know what?  Those atrophied legs.  We were on to your scam, though, bro.  What scam?  Norton.  It's no secret that Norton and I are good friends off the air and stuff.  He's like, you know, you guys gave me a great opportunity and stuff.  You know, I do tough crowd, but I'm not allowed to say what I want to say.  And I go do this and I do other radio shows.  You know, he wants us to think he appreciates us because we allow him to say, you know, whatever he wants, right? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  No, it's all about getting the pussy.  That's it.  We got you more pussy than anybody else.  You did?  You raised a good point?  You don't give a flying F about being able to say what you want on our show.  No, that's not true.  I like creative freedom because the more creative freedom you have, the funnier you are.  The funnier you are equals bigger gigs.  Bigger gigs equals more money, which equals more girls putting their mouth...  All you care about a hepatitis dispenser.  All you care about...  That's what that equals.  All you care about after the show is you've got mail. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  Yes.  You've got...  I'm a sex addict.  So now you were chatting with that girl.  Yeah.  Let's see if her pictures are still here.  There she is.  Yeah.  She's pretty sexy there.  She sent me some pictures.  Nothing really hardcore.  Yeah.  And after we talked, I just had to scrap another one into a napkin.  And I did.  It was fantastic.  By the way...  After you spoke with her, you tossed one off on me.  We were just chatting normally.  She was very nice.  And we were just chit-chatting.  Bullshitting.  A little chit-chat. 
[02:38:30]  And I still had that three-quarter Levitra rod.  By the way, Eric Logan down in Washington, he's been text messaging me like crazy this morning.  During the show?  Yeah.  Oh, here comes another one.  Is that you?  Yeah, that's...  And it's Opie's phone.  Why don't you turn the phone...  You son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Your phone's been making the noise in the headphones.  No, he just wanted to let us know that Howard's losing his effing mind today because he can't  do his radio show.  See, we're uncensored over here.  We could do whatever the hell we want. 
[02:39:00]  We could curse.  We could have...  We were going to have a girl masturbate today, but the phones weren't working, so we blew  that opportunity.  I invented masturbation.  Blew that opportunity.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  And Eric Logan, our big boss down in Washington, I'm so glad he listens to us over Howard.  I hate these clones, Robin.  But he...  I invented the inhale-exhale thing, and now everyone does it.  They call it breathing.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  See, I...  That was me.  I knew that we would start driving everyone else nuts because when people start figuring  out that Opie and Anthony are on XM Satellite Radio doing an uncensored show, it's going 
[02:39:30]  to drive Howard, Don, and Mike, the rest of them absolutely nuts.  Yeah, because...  Because they can't compete with this.  No, they have to adhere to the rules.  Oh, no service.  The rules.  I was going to read some of the text messages I'm getting.  But they're dumping out of Howard's show like crazy today, and he's just losing his mind,  and here we are on XM Satellite Radio doing whatever the hell we want, and it's driving  him absolutely nuts, and I love it.  Absolutely love it. 
[02:40:00]  Interesting.  He wants to walk off the show.  We can't do a show anymore, but he has something called a contract.  He's just losing his mind.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  Have fun over there as we reinvent radio.  We get to reinvent radio.  And then everyone else will follow us.  Right.  The Satellite Radio.  Come on over, everybody.  Hoo-hoo.  You know how nice it is?  Just even...  Well, even if it's not profanity, it's just content.  To be able to talk about whatever... 
[02:40:30]  Phone.  Oh, phone.  Oh, my God.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, get the phone.  Who cares?  Hello.  And it's kind of hard to...  I don't want to talk while Ope's talking, because not only...  I'm doing a radio show.  I'll call you after the show.  Ope, who is that?  Oh, I can hear it almost.  Me too.  Okay.  Bye.  I can almost hear your caller.  There you go.  Yeah.  Your 44th Enema's ready.  All right.  I hear that it was kind of like civil rights footage in your ass last night. 
[02:41:00]  Is that what happened?  Oh, yeah.  Want to get into that?  Of course we do.  Howard's basically screaming that he's going to satellite radio in 2006.  Oh, really?  That's like 15 months away from now.  Sounds like contract negotiations to me.  We'll have to wait and see.  See how much money Viacom coughs up to keep him.  He'll go where the money is.  There you go.  Yeah, I haven't dumped in four days. 
[02:41:30]  Really?  Until last night, I had to make myself dump.  Now, you were-  I had to do something I've never done before in my life.  What, digits?  And I'm going to have to do it again after the show.  Have you been putting digits in there trying to pull it out?  Hell no, man.  I've heard that.  Did you have to hire a gentleman to come over and hold onto your hips and put something  in there to loosen it up a little bit?  Hell no.  We've all done that a few times, haven't we?  Hell no. 
[02:42:00]  I had to get a couple enemas.  Never done this before in my life.  I had to do that when I was a kid, a little kid.  Really?  I was like, yeah.  Like 11.  It is the most humiliating thing you can do to yourself.  What?  Now, you had-  Give yourself an enema?  I never did it.  You didn't have it administered by somebody?  Who's going to-  Is there a service for that?  Yeah, it's called a dominatrix.  They will-  Dude, I'm trying to help you.  Hell no.  They'll put you on your hands and knees.  They'll come over in a nurse outfit.  They'll put that in.  They'll make you hold it while they do see it. 
[02:42:30]  That is-  Okay.  Let me bring something up.  It's all right.  I do not get the nurse thing.  You know, when I'm trolling through pornography on the internet, and I see the girl in the  little maid outfit with the little skirt and stuff like that, and then any various strippers  that wear their outfits and little things, and Catholic school skirts, very cool, the  little Catholic school dress.  And then you go by the girl with the white rubber nurse suit with the big mash X on her 
[02:43:00]  head from, you know, World War II medic emblem on her head.  Nothing.  This does nothing for me.  I have to disagree.  Well, you are a disturbed, sick individual that likes girls to dump on your chest.  Well, who doesn't?  I mean, you know, come on.  You say that like it's callous, but I mean, we all enjoy a log on the chest.  It shows you who's boss.  You're right.  I was mouthy.  Drop one on there and straighten me out, miss. 
[02:43:30]  The nurse thing is all about enemas.  That's what it is.  It's an enema.  And enemas aren't fun or sexy.  They're disgusting.  My favorite hooker ever is in Vegas.  Her name is Megan, and she does a character called Nurse Pig.  This is true.  She comes over.  She puts on a nurse outfit, and she is so sexy, and she gives me a golden shower, and 
[02:44:00]  she spits in my mouth, and then we do full service.  And she's like, you like Nurse Pig giving you your medicine?  And I do.  I like when Nurse Pig gives me my medicine, and it's completely true.  Nurse Pig gives you your medicine.  Yeah.  Yeah, she does, and it does help.  What does she do?  Hello.  Urinates on me and spits in my mouth, and then we have sex.  True.  And that's what she calls her.  Oh, my God.  Nurse Pig.  And she's fantastic.  She's absolutely fantastic.  And that's what she considers giving you her medicine?  That is my medicine. 
[02:44:30]  What else is medicine?  Yeah.  A golden treat.  Straightens her right out.  What can we do about that?  You amaze me, man.  I'm a pervert.  I'm a real pervert.  Every guy thinks I'm a pervert.  You really are.  Really.  I think you, because you have an addictive personality, of course.  A little, yeah.  And I think you're completely addicted to sex, which is fine.  Nothing wrong with that.  It seems like the least harmful of the addictions, but it makes you such a sick, sick person.  Dude, you don't understand how, I'm not going to get graphic here.  I don't want to get into my personal life, but when you're rinsing out your mouth after 
[02:45:00]  a sexual experience, and you're worried about you just caught a tapeworm, you know, there's  just something inherently wrong with that.  And this is no bit.  No, he loves it.  No, Norton doesn't do bits.  He loves it.  It's funny you say that.  You are sick, man.  You're welcome.  You're all right, man.  Brought you your little breakfast.  What did you get?  A little pop-toys. 
[02:45:30]  I don't want them heated.  Wow, that's something.  I could not get that deep into that sickness.  The taking leaks on you.  You like, and how old are you when a girl first urinated on you, Jimmy?  It's funny.  Well, let's backtrack really quick.  First time, I realized I liked it when I was probably in second grade.  I used to pay, not pay her, but get this girl to sit on my face because she would always  wet her pants.  So I liked the way it smelled, and the first time I ever experienced GS was probably when 
[02:46:00]  I was like 25 or something like that.  Yeah.  A girl I was dating used to wet her panties for me, and I would smell it, and this is  true.  You are.  And then we started doing, I would lay a towel back, and she would dribble a little, and  I would swallow it, and I kind of liked it, and it became like a thing we did.  And I'm sure now she's in a relationship somewhere just emotionally and mentally beat up.  Oh, I'm certain.  I really am a wrecking ball.  I just leave a human wreckage behind me.  I pissed on another human being. 
[02:46:30]  All right, go find a nice fella.  They trust me.  They fall in love.  Girls you date.  Not all girls, but girls you date.  And then you just have them do the worst, most reprehensible stuff.  And it's against their will, pretty much, but they do it because...  No, no, no, no.  Not, I mean, you're pinning them down saying, piss on me.  I mean, but they're, you know, they probably would rather not do it.  Well, when they realize that, when they look down and they see the normal tricks they try  on guys, which is the neck kissing and the, do you want me to be naughty? 
[02:47:00]  When they look down, they realize my mule looks like a pig's tail.  And then when they do something really filthy and they see the nice direction they get,  I guess they put two and two together and realize, I'm going to bore this guy if I don't do  something really dirty.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  He's far gone, man.  I don't mess with kids.  That does nothing for me.  I don't mess with animals.  You know what I mean?  I'm not a monster.  But with a girl, I'm dirty.  Yeah, you're a dirty guy.  Dirty.  Oh, by the way, can I just explain how I made Bob Kelly puke by rubbing my belly button  and he sniffed it for two poker chips and then he threw up in his toilet? 
[02:47:30]  Bob was also a compulsive, addicted sociopath and we were playing poker and I had two $1  chips.  I'm like, dude, will you sniff my belly button?  He's like, I'm not smelling that.  I'm like, come on, man.  It's like grape jelly.  He's like, I'm not smelling that.  I'm like, I'll give you two bucks.  He goes, you give me two chips?  And I'm like, yeah.  And then this idiot closes his eyes like he's about to have a wine tasting.  I think I get a nice dollop in there and I hold it under his nose and he goes, and he  runs to the bathroom and he vomits in the toilet and he's got, he picked up a Listerine 
[02:48:00]  because he said it got into his taste buds.  So I'll show you guys on the break.  I have a photo of Bob Kelly puking in his toilet because of my belly button stinks.  What is in there that smells so bad?  What was in that?  Was it the night before I had scrapped on myself?  And you know how you scrap and you wipe it out of your belly button and the next morning  it stinks?  Is it worse than the stuff behind Voss's ear?  I don't know.  He said it was.  The next time Voss comes into the studio, we all have to take a sniff. 
[02:48:30]  I'm taking a bunch of them.  I didn't puke.  I dry heaved, though.  It's legendary.  He'll never do it.  Anthony will never do it?  Never.  No.  Anthony, you gotta do it.  No.  It is horrific, the smell that comes from behind Voss's ear.  Why would I want to smell that?  Because it's hilarious.  And why does it stink behind Voss's ear?  It is hilarious, though.  What?  There was a whole bunch of us.  It was me, Adam Ferrara, Rick, a bunch of us in a parking lot all taking turns.  It is the funniest thing you'll ever do in your life. 
[02:49:00]  It's not funny.  It's disgusting.  It's truly disgusting.  What's back there?  But two people puked doing it.  I was dry heaving.  And you're laughing so hard because it smells so freaking bad.  He's tricking everyone.  He runs his finger up the crack of his ass.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He doesn't do this thing behind Voss's ear.  Because I've heard about this for years, and I finally did the smell test, and it is horrendous.  It's only behind one of his ears.  And he'll scrape it onto those little hands, which also look exactly like turtle feet.  Those stupid doll hands in his. 
[02:49:30]  And he gets a substance on the back of his finger.  He's actually rubbed it on the table and then poured water.  What is it?  Yeah, he'll pour water.  He'll rub it on the table one time, and he poured water on it, and the water went around it like it will with oil.  So it's some kind of an oil that he builds up behind his ear.  It's like a pussy boil or something.  No, no, no.  It's not that.  I don't know.  You'll see.  I don't know what it is.  It's disgusting, whatever it is.  It's foul.  And why are you smelling it?  Because I'm a team player.  It's not about me.  It's about the team.  I don't smell anything.  People go, here, smell this. 
[02:50:00]  Fingers or anything.  And what is it going to take for you to do it?  Because it's hilarious.  I will never, ever do it.  It's hilarious.  All right.  I will never do it.  We'll have to keep you out of it then, but it is hilarious.  If you can conjure it up in a lab artificially.  All right, listen.  I've got to take a dump.  I'm dying.  That's right.  You didn't tell us about your experience.  Well, because he went off on a great tangent, to be honest with you.  I want to hear about your experience getting an enema.  I just lost the phones.  There it is.  Well, first of all, I had to dress like the Unabomber to go get it. 
[02:50:30]  I'm not even kidding.  You were all embarrassed.  A hooded sweatshirt and sunglasses.  Went to the Duane Reade up on Broadway in the 70s there.  Yeah.  And then I walked around the store for literally 20 minutes, found where the enemas were.  The aisle was busy with a parent and kids, so I had to wait for them to finish.  Then I tucked it in my sweatshirt.  Then I bought about, I don't know, 10 or 12 other things.  Then I had to wait for the register that had absolutely no one around.  I found a lady that barely spoke English, so I thought that was okay. 
[02:51:00]  And then I just threw all my stuff on the counter and bought the enema along with more cold medicine and tissues and mouthwash.  All this stuff just to distract that I'm getting the enema.  And then I go home, and I felt like a rape victim in the shower because that was the only place I figured you could do it.  Right?  In the shower?  Yeah.  In the bathtub.  It's probably safe to do it.  Yeah, because you don't want that stuff getting everywhere.  So I run the shower water to get the bathtub warm, so I'm laying down. 
[02:51:30]  Were you on your back in the tub?  Yeah, on my back in the tub that was ice cold, so I had to run the shower water.  So the shower water is pelting me.  And then I, yeah, lifted my legs up onto the side of the tub and ministered the...  I was humiliified.  Humilified.  I was humiliified by the whole thing.  It humiliified me. 
[02:52:00]  My sister's name's Humilified.  It was brutal.  How did you, um...  And then you make diarrhea, basically.  I never did this before.  So now you squirt, you inserted the tube into your boyish little backside.  Yeah.  Your blonde hair is wet.  You're laying in the tub with your legs up in the air.  Yeah, trying to make this sound sexy, you creep.  Well, I'm talking here.  I'm trying to be your friend.  I'm helping you out.  Your abs are glistening with the tub water.  That's right, and the water was bouncing off my stomach, the beads. 
[02:52:30]  Your wispy, golden blonde ass hairs are damp, and you put the...  See, you can't talk like this on regular radio.  Don't say ass hair, that's too descriptive.  You can't even say enema on regular radio.  No.  You can't say insert on regular radio.  You can't say enema even if you're describing what Michael Powell needs to relax him.  And everyone laughed when they said, Opie and Anthony are going to XM Satellite Radio.  I didn't laugh.  No, we understand the future.  I didn't.  Right.  We understand what's going on.  Ant, I don't know if I'm correct in this, but when we were kids, didn't something like 
[02:53:00]  happen after Halloween one year, and we were all like constipated badly?  I mean, really bad.  Backed up with candy corn.  Really bad.  That waxy candy corn.  And we went to like Dr. Fuchs, right?  Or a pediatrician back then?  That was the first and only time that I had to deal with constipation.  Did you have an enema?  No.  I did.  No, no, no.  Anthony didn't, but I had to.  It was like doctor's orders.  And I was scared.  I was scared, Essel, to do it.  And Uncle Joe...  No, I'm serious, man.  This is all coming back to me now, Jimmy. 
[02:53:30]  And Uncle Joe...  Talk slower.  Uncle Joe had to sit on me while Mom administered the enema.  Oh, of course he had to sit on you.  He had to sit on me.  I wouldn't hold still for it.  But after you're done with that, you're supposed to like hold it inside for a while and...  Hell no, man.  That was the most uncomfortable feeling ever.  The most disgusting thing I've ever been through, man.  I had to go...  I did two yesterday.  Let me ask you.  Two.  And it still came out like Silly Putty.  There's so much crap in me, it's not even funny.  Did you lay on your back when you administered it? 
[02:54:00]  Look at my stomach.  This is all crap.  Look at that stomach.  Look at that...  Oh.  You actually...  He has very slender abs.  He's built like a Filipino swimmer.  You know I'm in pretty good shape in general.  Look at this.  That is all crap in my belly.  That has to come out.  It's really disgusting.  You really have to take a dump when your body shape changes.  That's an indicator.  I was looking around my apartment to see what I could like...  Like...  Use to kind of loosen things up.  Stop it.  You were going to...  Roto-Rooter.  I'm not kidding.  It's killing me.  I'm getting headaches because it's toxic. 
[02:54:30]  I know what you can do.  What?  I've done this before and this is not a bit.  Go for a colonic.  I'll tell you where to go.  Fuck no, man.  No, listen to me.  Listen.  It helps.  They put the tube up in you.  It's very painful for a while.  Like for the first five seconds because my little hiney is tight.  They put it in.  Oh.  They shoot the warm water in.  It will clear you out.  I went...  I was going for an eight-step treatment, but I only went through three of them.  And while you're getting it...  Eight steps?  It cleans out.  It helps to be colon cancer stuff.  That's what I'm worried about.  So what will happen is...  That's what he's worried about.  He's worried about colon...  He's worried about Brazilian hookers without rubbers. 
[02:55:00]  You should be worried about the hip.  That can't happen to me.  The high five.  The ninja.  So what's happening is, as the water's shooting up to you, the lady gives you something.  It feels like almost like a floor waxer, but it's small.  It vibrates.  And you hold it over your stomach, I guess, to shake the logs loose that are in there.  And your system, you're watching it go down a tube.  A clear tube.  Hell no, bro.  You have to watch.  You can.  You don't have to.  I watched.  It was better than most things Hollywood puts out.  Looks like the tool video.  Yeah, right.  The guy pushing the crap through the tube. 
[02:55:30]  I was going to say, it looks like any Nine Inch Nails video.  Oh, one word.  Cure.  Suppository.  Oh, see, that's what happened now when I was a kid.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  So you had stuff stuck up in your butt.  It was a suppository with, like, the doctor took a big finger full of Vaseline first and  just went in there and then took the suppository and put it in there and was waiting.  You know, by the time I got to my grandmother's house, I had to go to the bathroom.  I went in there.  I was a kid and what came out shouldn't have been, it looked like a stegosaurus had taken 
[02:56:00]  a dump in there.  It was just huge.  It hurt me.  Remind me someday to tell you the suppository dominatrix story.  I won't tell it now.  Hey, that could be a good tease.  I like that.  We do have to take a break.  All right.  And I got to take a dump.  Godspeed.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  Hit, hit, hit.  Prepare to be wowed.  What knockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  Though I have always been a fool for long, I have finally made my score.  I got a girl and I don't mean to boast, but she loves me the most.  Even though she's a highly paid whore. 
[02:57:00]  She'll give head to a sheep.  She can stuff three cocks in her cheek.  But she comes home to me.  She'll do the groom and the best man.  She'll slap your ass in the back of a van.  But she comes home to me. 
[02:57:30]  She could fuck nine guys in a row, but still have a tent for me.  And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips, unless you pay an extra fifty.  So mister, don't you fall in love.  Cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove.  Since her heart belongs to me.  She has a throat that just won't quit. 
[02:58:00]  She can take all of it.  I still have room for your balls, but she shops in the malls for me.  She'll say twelve, then call back and say one.  But I don't care, I know it's just work, not fun.  When she blows you jack, don't you think she's not thinking of me.  She'll go down on a yak, lick a horse's nutsack, but strictly for cash. 
[02:58:30]  And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee to watch you put a water bottle in her gash.  Put a water bottle in her gash.  She'll let you suck her nips till they're leaking.  But don't you dare try to go and take in.  Cause she does that with me. 
[02:59:00]  Her boy's as sweet as honey.  But when she moans, it's just for the money.  Unless she's sitting on me.  She'll jam your asshole with a mouse.  But she won't do it in our house.  Tough luck jack.  She knows that don't fly with me.  She might eat your wife's box. 
[02:59:30]  But she won't tell you where you left your socks.  She rolled up and down your fat brick.  But it was Lee who took her to the Meg Ryan flick.  She's got a face full of nuts and a mouth full of cots.  She's done see Larry King for new kids on the block.  She blew the Winnipeg Jets right after a game.  But they never got to know her actual name on your face.  She will piss on your chest. 
[03:00:00]  She might poop.  But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup.  That's simply reasonable.  She'll bite you.  She'll spank you.  But she'll never thank you for free.  Cause baby.  Cause I'll do it.  Coming home. 
[03:00:30]  Did you just put a firecracker in my vagina?  I just wanted to see what would happen.  No.  No.  Get it out.  Come on.  What's the big deal?  I'll be fine.  Are you fucking crazy?  What are you doing with that later?  I'm coming closer.  If you blow up my pussy, I'm going to bludgeon you.  Oh, stop.  Relax.  I'm just screwing around.  Oh my God. 
[03:01:00]  I'm so sorry.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Rawr!  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I'm an innovator.  We could say fuck over here and you can't. 
[03:01:30]  You could say fuck in another year and three months.  Well, we could say it now.  That's my little song.  Whip Em Out Wednesday, yes.  That's what the wow is all about on the highways and the byways.  You put a wow on your car, maybe right in the dirt of the back of your truck and girls  see that and if they're feeling happy, they will flash their lovely tits at you.  Whatever it takes.  Cause we could say tits over here.  Cause we're the innovators. 
[03:02:00]  I can too when I revolutionize the industry.  I can swear over the past two years that you guys have been off.  There are more wow stickers on the road now than there ever were.  And there could be a lot more if XM Satellite Radio down there in Washington gets their act  together and put the system in place where our listeners could just mail in a self-addressed  stamped envelope or leave their mailing address on the website and then they would get the  wow stickers and then the whole wow thing could grow again, Anthony.  It'll happen.  The phenomenon will grow again. 
[03:02:30]  It'll happen.  Ah, I want to go to the phones.  Okay, let's, uh, Marky in New Jersey.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Listen, I want to talk about Stern real quick, but why are we paying two bucks to hear you  guys say the F word and the S word?  I just said tits.  I said fuck.  Yeah, but it's like every other second, you know.  No, here's the deal, bro.  I mean, you know, it's got to be kind of clever.  The rule we're trying to start on our show is that don't curse just to curse, but if  it makes sense, then curse. 
[03:03:00]  Well, let me ask.  I mean, the first day, guys were, you know, calling in like, holy fucking, they're just  losing their minds that they get cursed.  And it's kind of, it kind of is a distraction when you're trying to do some, if I dare say,  clever radio.  When you guys are speaking in everyday language, don't you curse?  Like, just a curse?  I don't know, man.  We just had so much fun with that whole alphabet thing over the years that maybe we got to  break the habit.  I don't know.  Just trying to find a balance is all.  It's brand new.  It's only third day in.  Just trying to find a balance.  So it's not gratuitous, but it's also not too, you know, clean either. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  I like when Norton's been cursing the most lately.  You know what?  A little bit.  But no, it's more important than cursing the curse is, you know, here at XM Satellite Radio,  we could say masturbate.  We could say, I inserted an enema.  This is the type of thing you cannot say on broadcast radio anymore.  Exactly.  And that's why Anthony and I gave up on broadcast radio and came to Satellite Radio, knowing  that the audience would be a lot smaller, but eventually it would grow because everyone  would catch on and figure out that commercial radio is dead. 
[03:04:00]  Right.  Okay?  So all those other DJs out there were laughing at Anthony and I when we made this decision.  But there was no doubt in our mind that this is the future of radio.  I hear you, bro.  So we took the big step and we're talking to a lot less people, but we know this is going  to grow and we know this is the future of radio.  We're very excited.  And all the other DJs out there, they're going to figure it out and eventually they're going  to get in line and follow us.  Apparently.  Well, apparently Howard's been talking about his show all morning.  We've been driving him nuts for years and especially the last three days because I know 
[03:04:30]  he has XM Satellite Radio.  I know for a fact.  And I know he's been listening to our show and he hears us speaking freely and cursing  and talking about things that, quite frankly, he can't talk about on his show.  You know what I love?  He's talking about Sirius all morning, how they're telling him he's going to revolutionize  radio.  Well, you know what?  Eat him.  Revolutionize.  Oh, I was talking to XM originally, but I think we know we're not going to go there  anymore.  Well, you know, then he's making a very stupid decision because Sirius is way, way behind  as far as the technology goes in satellite radio. 
[03:05:00]  Way behind.  We could have went to Sirius, but quite frankly, they don't have their act together over there.  Their units look like fish finders.  They're huge and cumbersome, if I dare say.  Dare.  And they have no one listening yet.  And they're making huge money deals with people that aren't bringing any subscribers  in.  The company, you know, there's some nice people over there and stuff, but they have a long  way to go to catch up to XM. 
[03:05:30]  Now, we know why Ben didn't get a paycheck for six months.  I took Ben's money.  Thanks, Allie.  Hey, can we get the ping pong sound or something back, too?  Did they own that?  No, we could.  Yeah, we got that as well.  You do?  Yeah.  I'll bust it out, man, because we haven't heard that in a long time.  Well, yeah, we're adding things every day.  All right, cool.  And more stories about Norton's whore-fucking, man.  They're the best.  Gotta love that.  Don't lay off those.  All right, guys.  They're all true.  You suck.  Later.  All right, buddy. 
[03:06:00]  Let's go to Jeff in Boston.  Hey, Jeff.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  Yeah, I just called in to talk about that Stern thing, too.  Serious sucks, though, guys.  Serious is, you know, they got a long ways to go.  So maybe when Howard...  Wicked suck, dude.  Maybe when Howard goes to satellite radio in 2006, they'll have their act together.  Who knows?  We'll see.  Talking about two years from now, I mean.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, who knows what's going to happen in two years, huh?  I know for a fact we have been driving him absolutely nuts, because we had the balls to 
[03:06:30]  take this step into, you know, uncharted territory.  Yeah.  His show's all bleeped every 10 seconds.  It's on like a 20-second delay, his show.  You can't even hear what he's saying.  But for some reason, I guess he's saying he's going to be the innovator, and he's going  to be the first one.  Really?  In more revisionist history.  Really?  Just like his website.  Yeah.  Well, you guys did it first.  Remember that?  I think everyone will know that.  Hey, we know it.  I got XM just to get you guys.  Thanks, bro. 
[03:07:00]  And this O&A virus is going to be spreading all across America, and there's nothing you  can do about it, so.  You guys wake me up in the morning for work, so keep it going, fellas, all right?  All right.  Thank you.  Keep it going, guys.  Nice.  Phones are going nuts all of a sudden.  Bob from PA.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, man.  How you guys doing?  It's good to hear you guys again.  Right on, man.  Hey, I just called about the Howard thing also.  I heard his crap he was saying there about him being the innovator and the first to change,  and I just thought I wanted to give you guys a call and finally get through and let you 
[03:07:30]  know about it, because it's all BS.  Yeah, the innovator.  The first.  The first to willingly do it.  Excuse me.  No.  Yeah.  Sorry.  It's crazy.  And also, you know, I wanted to say you guys definitely got your act together a little  bit, but XM overall, you know, you go between the different channels and everything.  They've still got some stuff to work out with the volume levels, you know?  You could be listening to classic rap on one channel and go to classical on another, and you  got to turn the volume way up or way down.  They definitely got to work on that.  Yeah, well, there you go. 
[03:08:00]  You know, they're working on things every day.  Yeah, but you guys definitely rock, and like I said, you know, as many other people have  said, I've been waiting for about a year and a half now.  You know, I was watching XM back in the days when the stock was nothing, and they were testing  in California and Texas, and I waited all this long to finally hear what you guys meant  to finally get the service.  All right.  Got it for me.  Got it for the woman.  She's playing it at work right now.  Good old son of America.  So, you know, you guys keep rocking on.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Yep.  Yeah, the reality is we could have went to Sirius or XM, and it was, you know, it was 
[03:08:30]  an easy decision for us.  No brainer, man.  And then the gang over there trashed us, making believe, oh, we were, well, they were interested  in us.  We were just kind of listening to what they had to say.  Yeah.  No, they had us in hotel suites in Times Square.  They would have blown us if we asked.  They wanted us so freaking bad.  And then they go into the trade magazines and go, well, they were interested in us.  We kind of just listened to what they had to say.  Scott Greenstein, you lying fuck. 
[03:09:00]  I'm the innovator now, though.  Please.  Yeah, Howard is paying to hear Opie and Anthony.  That is a fact I know for sure.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I just think it's hilarious that all these schmucks out there are paying, subscribing  to your service to listen to you guys so they can bust on you.  I just think that is the funniest damn thing going.  I guarantee he has our show on his little XM radio dial. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Guarantee it.  It's great, man.  All right.  Welcome back.  That's all I got, man.  Have a great day.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Later on.  Later.  We'll do one more here, and then we'll go back to our little radio show.  Hey, George.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, morning, guys.  It's so great to have you back.  Listen, we want Howard to go to serious because then it's really game on.  Game on.  The last thing you guys want to do is have him with XM doing all that,  oh, don't let them talk about me again.  Right.  Game on. 
[03:10:00]  Game on, brother.  All right.  Great to have you back.  You guys suck.  Thanks, buddy.  Bye.  Yeah, game on.  We can talk freely about him and how much of a hypocrite he was to us  and everyone else that worked for Viacom.  Yeah.  Run to the boss.  And how all of Viacom is scared of Howard, that he actually runs the place.  I want their satellite shot down.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  So they can't talk about me.  I invented cursing, Robin.  Fuck.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  I said that first.  What a shithead.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. 
[03:10:30]  It's going to be great, isn't it?  We'll be on satellite radio, Robin.  I invented everything.  I invented the satellite, Robin.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  You invented the satellite there, Howie?  That's right.  I invented the word ass fuck.  Come face.  Hoo, hoo.  All me.  All me, Robin.  Dick bag.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Yeah.  You got until, what, 2006?  Have fun.  Have fun. 
[03:11:00]  Mm-mm.  Going to be an adventure.  You know, it's going to be nice between now and then to see his listenership drop while  people are paying to hear you guys.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  His people will be paying to hear you guys.  Yeah.  I invented shithead, Robin.  Mine.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  All mine.  To the Howie Copter.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. 
[03:11:30]  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Out to the Hamptons.  Go to Billy Joel's wedding, Robin.  How was it?  It was a fucking great time.  You can't say that, Howard.  I can say that now.  No, you can't.  I can say that.  You can say that in 2006.  You can't say that now.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Look at my girlfriend's fucking tits.  You can't say that.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  I can say it all now.  I'm on satellite radio, Robin.  So I can say anything I want.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Out here in the Hamptons hanging out. 
[03:12:00]  Give me another fucking Seabreeze.  You can't say that yet.  Another one of those fag drinks.  You can't say the F word.  I can't say Seabreeze.  Well, you can say Seabreeze, yes.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  We get to curse, and he can't.  That's what it comes down to.  Boy, Martlin got fucked up the ass by me, didn't he?  I can say that now.  No, you can't.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Eventually, you'll be able to say that.  Hey, uh, baa-ba-fucking-booey. 
[03:12:30]  You can't say the F word yet.  I can't say that?  No.  Uh, 15 months and, uh, counting, Robin.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  The countdown clock.  Didn't we invent the countdown clock?  Ha, ha, ha.  Hey, uh, Robin, your pussy looks like a wallet.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[03:13:00]  What you get, people, now that I can curse on satellite radio.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Ow. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Let's see.  Let's go to Steve in Louisiana.  Steve, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man, what's up?  What's up?  Louisiana.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  What do you got?  Well, I've never heard y'all before, and I figured I'm going to activate my XM again  to hear what y'all are.  Y'all pretty funny.  I like it.  Hey, thank you.  It's only going to get better, bro.  Oh, yeah.  I want to be the first one down here to have a WOW sticker, too.  Send me one.  Well, as soon as they get their act together down in Washington, we'll be sending those 
[03:14:00]  WOW stickers all over the country.  What are you going to put it on, a pickup truck?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Is it going to go above or below the Dale Earnhardt No. 3 that you also have on your truck?  I don't have that on there.  Oh, you don't?  What do you got?  You got the Dale Jr. 8?  No, we don't do the Dale Jr.  I don't do racing.  Oh, okay.  Then it's got to go in between your rifle rack.  There you go.  There you go.  So we can see it.  You're stereotyping, Anthony.  There you go.  All right.  Well, thank you, Steve. 
[03:14:30]  All right, man.  I appreciate it.  Thanks for bringing the show to a screeching halt.  Yeah, no wonder they drag him behind trucks.  Waddledoodle, I apologize, Robin.  You can't do indecent material yet, Howard.  Why not?  Because you're still on regular radio.  No, no, no, no, no.  The FCC is up your butt.  Oh, wait.  Up your ass.  You could say up your ass.  Up my ass.  What the hell is that?  Ooh.  Steve is making an executive decision in the other room. 
[03:15:00]  Rock.  That's right, Robin.  Rob fucking zombie.  Rob zombie.  I was hanging out with him in the Hampton with Billy fucking Joel the other day.  We were rocking at his wedding.  What a lovely bride. 
[03:15:30]  Got a snatch like a clamshell.  Nice and tight, that girl.  Very young.  What a hot twat on her, Robin.  Hey, Robin, you see my daughter's tits lately?  They're huge.  My daughter's got big, fat, huge tits, and I can say that now on satellite radio.  Oh, it's going to get interesting.  Oh, is it going to get interesting? 
[03:16:00]  Let's see.  Let's go to Pat.  Hey, Pat, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You tell us.  Well, if you really want to fix your little constipation problem...  Oh, back to that, yeah.  Yeah, I got it for you.  Okay.  It's called calcium citrate.  They sell it at, like, any of the drugstores.  It comes in, like, either cherry or lemon flavor.  You drink it, and I promise you, your constipation problem will be gone within an hour. 
[03:16:30]  Thank you, Dr. Pat.  I'm telling you, it works, man.  All right, well, thanks for that.  Hey, not a problem.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  I just drink, like, ten sea breezes, and it goes away.  I crap my pants.  Oh, I can say shit.  Not yet.  You can't say shit yet.  Why?  Opie and Anthony can say shit.  You can't yet.  Eventually, you'll be able to.  When could I say shit, Robin?  Didn't take him too long to figure out that this is the place to be, huh? 
[03:17:00]  That's right.  Duh.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  We knew the FCC won that battle, with us especially.  But I'm the one revolutionizing the industry, not you.  But you're going to be second aboard.  No, I'm first.  No one remembered the second guy that stepped onto the moon?  Who, uh, Buzz Aldrin?  Oh, was it Buzz Aldrin?  Yes.  I'm smart, too.  Fucking got a brain on me. 
[03:17:30]  You know, there was another guy that broke the four-minute mile when Roger Bannister did it.  In the same race, but no one remembers his name.  You mean the Hulk?  Robert Bannister?  Was that his name?  Roger Bannister was the guy who was the first to break the four-minute mile.  Who's the second guy?  No one cares.  Same race.  He did it, though.  No one cares.  I'm doing it first.  I did everything first.  Yeah, yeah, sure you did.  Mark from Kentucky. 
[03:18:00]  People just used to stay in one place, and I started putting one foot in front of the other and doing it again.  And now they call it walking, Robin.  I invented walking.  Hey, Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You tell us.  Oh, man, I got to say, I'm new to the XDM.  I love it, and I heard about your show, and I had to pay for it to get it.  Yeah, a whole whopping $1.99.  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm a truck driver, and that ain't much to me, but screw Bob and Tom and Howard Stern can lick my ass. 
[03:18:30]  Well, all these guys.  Yes, I can.  There are so many.  I'm live on my uncensored show.  There are so many guys that laughed and laughed and laughed when Anthony and I got fired for that Sex for Sam thing.  Yeah.  Oh, they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and let the FCC walk all over them.  And now look what's happening.  There's a bunch of guys out there on regular radio absolutely miserable.  Yep.  Absolutely miserable.  They can't wait for their contracts to end so they can jump aboard. 
[03:19:00]  Hello?  No, he's gone.  Oh, okay.  He's gone.  Kim, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys?  Welcome back.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  I've been a listener since before I got married, which is in 99.  Cool.  Because I remember Rick got married at the same time I did, so.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Yes.  Yeah, right.  Is Rick gone?  Rick is producing the morning show for Hot 97 here in New York City. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  No bad blood.  He just is doing his thing and we're doing ours.  Okay.  So, now, I'm not going to get too hard on you, but you know why I'm calling.  I heard the Hannity interview a week ago.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, we were on Sean Hannity's show.  Mm-hmm.  You guys did pretty good.  And then I heard your interview over the weekend on XM.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, we flip-flopped, didn't we?  Well, I don't know if you flip-flopped.  We don't want people to know what we're.  We're a scumbag conservative. 
[03:20:00]  I just want to not be alienated.  I will give you a secret as far as myself.  I don't want anyone ever thinking they know what I'm thinking.  Uh-huh.  There you go.  Well, you were always the Democrat of the group.  I lean.  No, these days I'm a moderate.  Okay.  Well, why'd you call them a scumbag conservative?  You don't like the conservatives?  No, no, that's what was said during the interview.  And really, this was more geared towards you, Anthony, because you've always been more towards 
[03:20:30]  the middle, but then you said you had to get that, you know, I don't remember the exact  words, fascist, religious, out of the office.  Yeah, I don't like the way he has his religious ideology and brings it into the office with him.  Yeah, well, I just didn't know if you felt that his entire policy ran on religion.  Hey, you have asshole hair, honey?  Howard, you can't say that yet.  What color's your asshole hair? 
[03:21:00]  No, you can't say that.  I bet it's blonde.  You have to still beat around the bush for a while.  I bet it's all blonde.  It has little dingleberries full of shit on it, doesn't it, sweetie?  You're not allowed to talk like that yet, Howard.  I can talk like that.  You still got to beat around the bush and work with the FCC there.  I bet she's got flowing blonde hair, don't you, sweetheart?  Don't you got dingleberries on it, don't you?  Big little lumps of shit hanging from your fucking asshole.  I can say that now, Robin.  No, you can't.  Oh, not yet?  Not yet. 
[03:21:30]  Tony, what's up?  Call Mel.  Get Mel on the phone.  He'll solve it.  My boss, Mel.  Mel can't help you right now.  No, Mel can't help you right now.  What satellite company did Mel go to?  Probably serious.  Tony, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  Welcome back.  Oh, thank you.  Yo, I lost a lot of respect for Stern.  And when he didn't credit you guys with the girl with the tits on the Today Show with  the Wow, I was just trying to take credit for it.  It was brilliant.  A girl's fucking Wow on her tits. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, that did go down.  Yeah, we made international history.  That's stupid.  I'm like Napoleon making international history, Robin.  We made international news with the girl flashing her tits on the Today Show.  And then, yeah, he did, that morning he did try to say it was one of his fans.  And the sad part about it is one of our Wow stickers was right across her belly.  Yeah.  That is a true story.  Matt Lauer would go on Tonight Show and just say he's like, oh, these two guys are from 
[03:22:30]  New York.  These two DJs.  Didn't he say your name and everything on the Tonight Show?  No, Howard didn't say our names until we got fired and we couldn't fight back anymore.  No, I meant Matt Lauer.  He credited you guys.  The guy from the Today Show credited you guys, Andre Leno, saying that it was you guys.  You know what I mean?  Oh, no, everyone knew it was us because the Wow sticker was right there.  Yeah.  All right.  Yo, Anthony, can I suck your cock?  Parenteau's not here. 
[03:23:00]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  All right.  Did we talk about everything today?  We invented it.  Wow.  It's going to be really hard to say that you're the innovator.  It really is.  Yeah, because we kind of made a name for ourselves.  And kind of made a big splash about coming to Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  I mean, the interviews are still coming in.  We're still going to do press all over the freaking world at this point, you know?  It's going to be kind of hard to hide that you were first. 
[03:23:30]  Are you going to tell everyone you were first and you're going to reinvent something that  is already being reinvented?  What?  What am I trying to say, huh?  This is like when the first movie stars decided to do television.  That's one of the quotes.  What?  What?  Huh?  I'm clock fucking Gable.  Put me on television.  All right.  Let's go to another phone call here.  Let's talk to...  Oh, Bob Kelly. 
[03:24:00]  Is this the hotline?  Hey.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  What's going on?  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Bobby.  What's happening, guys?  You notice Jimmy's not saying a word.  Yeah, I do.  I know he's clamming up nice and tight just in case.  He's holding out just in case we blow ourselves up again.  He needs a radio show to go on.  That's not true.  I was wondering why he's being so quiet.  Oh, my God.  I've taken notice.  That's not true at all.  He turned his mic off.  He sat in the corner.  He started rocking back and forth in the fetal position.  Let's all say hello to Jimmy the Joke Man Norton. 
[03:24:30]  What's happening, guys?  Congratulations on being back on.  Right on.  Thanks, Bob.  I just wanted to talk about Jimmy's belly button smell.  Okay.  The worst...  Let me tell you something.  First of all, he came to my house three days in a row, that little friggin...  He's like gambling with an old lady at nickel slots. 
[03:25:00]  Son of a bitch.  And he took my money three days in a row, came over, ate all my food, takes my money,  and all of a sudden has to go because he has some appointment upstairs.  And he goes, I ran out of all chips.  I ran out of my chips.  Doesn't give you a chance to make your money back, right?  No, of course not.  He came to my house, wins two big hands, and then takes all his money, cashes it out,  and plays with the house money like some 85-year-old asshole.  That's smart gambling.  So now you have no chance to make your money back.  He's either just going to break even or not. 
[03:25:30]  Exactly.  And then comes down the next day and tells me what type of whore he got with my money.  Oh, that's right.  Rubbing it in.  Yeah.  So I was down on chips.  I needed some money.  And he offered me $2 in chips, which was a lot because we were playing for 10-cent annies.  It wasn't a lot, Bob.  This is a week ago.  This is...  I think it was 1910.  I would say it was a lot back then, but it was 10 days ago.  Yeah, not a lot.  It was a lot as far as the annie, you stupid.  Two bucks? 
[03:26:00]  Two bucks when your annie's 10 cents, that's a lot of fucking money.  Yeah, but...  Do the math, shithead.  But not in real life.  I know not in real life, but when you're gambling, you're playing to win.  So you're saying that we had suspended all relief, so if I had given you 10 chips to  kiss me on the helmet, you would have, because the annie was 20 cents?  I might have.  Not for two bucks.  Go ahead.  Anyways, I didn't think it would smell.  I mean, it doesn't...  His belly button doesn't have a hole on the other end going into his body. 
[03:26:30]  So I didn't think it would smell that bad.  It's just a ditch.  It's just a ditch that it collects stuff from the air.  I didn't think it was connected to, like, a baby's asshole.  I've never...  Look, I've eaten ass.  I sniff my own ass.  Why?  Why would you sniff your own ass?  Because I itch it with my finger.  It's kind of a habit I do when I want to see it.  There is no way your finger should ever get close to your ass. 
[03:27:00]  If you have hemorrhoids, the feeling of itching a roid is probably one of the best feelings  I've ever seen.  What happens, though, Bob, if you ever...  What happens if you dig in your crack and then fall asleep?  What happens if I dig in my crack and I fall asleep?  Yeah, before you wash your hands?  I'll wake up and smell it.  Nobody told me he woke up one time and the dog was licking his fingers.  Thought it was another dog's ass.  This is hilarious.  Because that doesn't come off your fingers.  No, it's awful.  The one thing, when I do itch my ass, I have to hide my hand under the pillow when I'm sleeping 
[03:27:30]  with my girl because I just don't want her to wake up right next to my finger and look  at me disgusting.  Which she would.  Yeah, exactly.  His belly button made me gag instantly.  Worse than Voss' thing going on behind his ear?  You've got to understand, Voss' thing behind his ear, it's kind of like period blood.  It's like irony and has a little old stink to it. 
[03:28:00]  It's not that bad.  His, Norton's, it smelled like snake shit.  And wet hamburger meat.  I've never in my life, in my life, did I, I gagged instantly.  I went to the bathroom and this serial killer whipped out his camera and was just snapping  pictures of me as I'm puking in the bathroom and just giggling.  I'm going to have to take a look. 
[03:28:30]  I think Jimmy's pulling one up now.  I have a bunch of pictures.  It was an instant vomit, though, when you smelled his wet hamburger meat belly button.  It was the, it just instantly I puked up my lunch.  Instantly just came out of me.  I've never in my, and you know what happened?  He actually had a whore the night before and he busted on his belly.  And he had his own hot, steamy child salad caked in there from the night before, mixed  with whatever friggin' else goes in there.  It was the worst thing I've ever smelled in my life. 
[03:29:00]  There's a picture of you.  Vomiting.  Vomiting into the toilet bowl.  He's like a serial killer.  What's in his hand?  Is that the Listerine?  He's going to hit him in the taste buds.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Show up.  Look at the new haircut.  Do you see Colonel Kurtz vomiting into the toilet?  You shaved your head, huh?  I shaved my head.  What are you going to do?  That's a good look.  Yeah, well, you know, I was going bald and gray.  Hanging out with these jerk-offs, you know, you can't give them any ammunition.  Very nice.  All right, Bob.  Good first appearance on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:29:30]  There you go.  Good job.  Hey, Norton.  Not going to work ever, Bob.  Fucking asshole.  See you later.  Should we take a little regroup break?  Yeah?  We have three breaks to do, even though we don't play commercials here?  Why can't we just talk all the way to 10 while, you know, while everyone else plays like 20 minutes of commercials in a row?  Yeah.  That's how we'll get listeners.  More listeners.  No?  All right, hit the button and...  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons. 
[03:30:00]  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You know, honey, I knew it was hot and sunny before I even got out of bed today. 
[03:30:30]  Ask me why.  Say it.  Say why.  Repeat after me.  Why?  Because my balls were hanging low.  Let's say that real tight.  We're talking rainstorm.  Half-masked, cloudy with a chance of showers.  That's right, honey.  The penis sinks for itself.  It's got its own brain.  Why do you think the head's bigger than the rest?  I can prove it's got a mind of its own.  You ever get up in the morning, and he's already awake? 
[03:31:00]  He's dressed.  He's ready to go, right?  He's in the kitchen making fucking flapjacks.  You're in bed going, come on, Joey, five more minutes.  And your penis is going, take me shopping.  I need a new hat.  But you remember when they first came out with the hard-on, huh?  Third, fourth grade, you're leaning over like the hunchback of Notre Dame.  Teacher calls you up to the board, and you're like, I don't think so, honey.  You're the teacher, you figure it out, all right? 
[03:31:30]  I got some kind of ligament over here.  I don't know what's going on.  This thing is like alien.  It's drilling into the desk next to me.  Call a cop.  Maybe he'll throw a donut around.  But you grow up, you learn to accept the hard-on to deal with it.  Accept the pee hard-on, you know?  That's God's joke.  You get up, you're late for work, you got to take a squirt, and Joey's admiring the chandelier. 
[03:32:00]  You got to stand there like a moron and talk him down.  Come on, Joey, I dig you.  We'll dot I's and cross T's later.  Work with me.  Yeah, the morning hard-on.  I'll put that up against that Ginsu knife any day.  It'll slice, it'll dice.  It'll pump your car up if you got a flat tire.  See what I'm saying, Kyle?  Heather.  Hello, everybody.  I'm Tony Tantil, your Fresh Grows. 
[03:32:30]  So we're going to do a tip on another squash.  We're going to do a tip on the acorn squash.  The acorn squash has got this flavor to it that is absolutely amazing.  You don't have to mix it with anything.  You can make a soup, of course, with it, even desserts.  But when you cut them up and you put it in the oven and you put a little brown sugar in there  and you bake it for about 40 minutes, the flavor is incredible and they're loaded with nutritional value.  Now, when you select these, you want to make sure they have a little orange color and green color all the way around. 
[03:33:00]  And the bigger ones are the better ones.  And make sure they're kind of heavy for their size.  That means they'll have a smaller cavity inside there, which means it's better when you bake it because there's more there to bake.  When you bring them home, store them in a cool, dry place.  And I'm Tony Tantillo, your Fresh Grocer.  This is your tip of the day.  And if you want a great recipe, go to TonyTantillo.com.  I think it's two chimps on a Davenport and a base. 
[03:33:30]  The Opinality Show.  The Opinality Show.  And the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Famous for fuck all. 
[03:34:00]  All they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard.  And the German Empire.  Very Prussian, very organized.  Always building an empire.  Build an empire, build an empire.  Eins, zwei, eins, zwei.  Build an empire.  And then they'd celebrate with the World War and then lose the whole fucking empire by the end of the world.  Then the 30s.  Hitler, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France.  Second World War, Russian Front, not a good idea.  Hitler never played Risk when he was a kid. 
[03:34:30]  Because we know it was impossible to hold on to that Asia, Eastern Europe area, wasn't it?  You know.  In Risk.  You know, seven extra men.  We've all played it.  Seven extra men at the beginning of every go for that Asia bit.  But you could never hold it, could you?  Azerbaijan would fuck off somewhere.  And then fucking Siberia.  Come on, Ukraine.  Hang on there.  Fuck it.  Australasia.  That was the smart move, wasn't it?  The purples.  Get everyone on Papua New Guinea and just build up forces saying, fuck off to everyone. 
[03:35:00]  You'd never attack anyone.  You'd just get bigger and bigger and bigger.  Yes.  And I think America.  Because you're the new Roman Empire.  You know that.  Yeah.  There's no other big, you know, country.  You're the Roman Empire now.  There's no one else going, really.  China's there and big and large, but kind of, and kind of, they're just trying to do a bit  of housekeeping at the moment.  And so you've got vomitariums and orgies to look forward to.  I think you've already covered orgies, but vomitarium's the future. 
[03:35:30]  Maybe that's in the bulimic area.  I don't know.  But, um, because I get the, I get the impression that America after the Second World War would  really like to have built up an empire, but, you know, everyone else in the world was  going, well, you can't now.  We've just given that up.  Email on the go.  I'm Kevin Eby with Chip Talk.  The ability to send text messages is a standard feature of most cell phones.  Now, one wireless company is out with a messaging device that eliminates the phone.  AT&T Wireless says it designed the Ogo for teens and young adults. 
[03:36:00]  Studies show a fair number of people in that age range have spent far more time sending  short, instant messages than they do sending even regular email.  The device is small.  It's only about four and a half inches by three inches, but it comes with a full keyboard.  There's a key for the letter S.  You no longer have to hit the seven button four times.  The Ogo service is compatible with most popular instant messaging systems, AOL, MSN, and Yahoo,  and it's also compatible with the full email systems from those companies.  You can view your inbox and send and receive messages. 
[03:36:30]  The emphasis, though, is on instant messaging.  You can set it up so that it lets you know the moment your friends get online.

[03:37:30]  Go check out Channel 42.  XM LM appreciates you holding.  Someone will be right with you.  Radio to the power of X.  XM Satellite Radio.  The Opium.  It's fucking stupid.  The Opium Show.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday on the Opium Anthony Show. 
[03:38:00]  We didn't do much as far as that is concerned.  But, I don't know, as the weeks go by, we'll get the Whip'em Out Wednesday thing going again, right?  Sure.  First thing we need is the WOW stickers.  We'll work on that after the show and talk to the gang down there in Washington  to see how you can get your WOW sticker, put it on your vehicle, 
[03:38:30]  and then if the ladies see the WOW, if they feel like it, we'll flash you.  Simple, simple concept.  There you go.  We couldn't do stoner spelling bee today.  No, we had a little problem with the phones earlier.  A little?  Well, we didn't get our first phone call until 7.30, New York time, hour and a half into the show.  So, that kind of wrecked that.  So, maybe tomorrow we could do the stoner spelling bee.  That'd be nice.  And the FU line's still not working?  No?  I don't think so.  Okay.  We have so many things to fix. 
[03:39:00]  We talked about Rodney Dangerfield dying at 82.  Maybe we needed 15 months to sort things out.  Just to get everything together.  Everything's going to work out fine, guys.  The phones will get fixed.  Let's take lemons and make lemonade here.  Let's feel a little bit better.  I don't like the way everybody's being like a bunch of negative Nellies.  Everything is going to be fine.  Negative Nellies.  Yeah.  All of us.  You were the one that was more out of control than anyone today.  Once I got my latte, I was fine.  Do you understand that's all I need is my medium iced latte from Starbucks and I'm fine. 
[03:39:30]  Do you remember when we had Rodney on the show and we got him high?  Yeah, he loved smoking pot, Rodney.  He loved the weed for like all day long.  He would be stoned.  That's what I heard.  And we took him into Club Stinky, which was the stairwell.  And he smoked his pot.  Was that the day when he came on when we were at N.E.W., right?  Because I got him the first time.  I finally got to meet Rodney.  He's one of my childhood idols.  Yeah.  And I missed him getting high because I was gone the second time he was on. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  He got high that day.  He got high every time he came on.  Yeah.  We had a lot of fun with Rodney over the years.  Rodney's, everyone who knew him, knew he smoked a lot of pot.  It's a real bummer.  I know.  I know.  It's such a great, great, prolific fucking comic, man.  In a coma for a while there.  He survived a lot of crazy surgeries, too.  Yeah.  I was reading his book on the way home from L.A., and I was laughing out loud on the plane.  Or LOL, as I say in computer terms.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I was laughing out loud alone reading the book. 
[03:40:30]  It must have been frightening.  It's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Did they escort you off the airplane?  A man with a weak chin going, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  I've always wanted to do that, sit on a plane and, like, laugh out loud.  And when I hold up, it says, uh, uh, JonBenet Ramsey trial transcripts.  Or, you know, police blotter information.  That would have been funnier if there was actually a trial.  But, you know, Mr. Improv Skills of an Autistic fucking said, uh, the JonBenet Ramsey trial, which never occurred. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, we know that.  Nice try, meat tits.  See, we can say tits on this show.  I don't like to, though.  It's a poor taste.  What, you don't like that word?  No, I don't like the dirty language.  I'm not a potty man.  Oh, sure.  You've cursed more than all of us.  That's true.  You guys cursed a little bit recently, though.  We cursed a little more today than usual.  It feels good.  I'm using characters, though.  It's not like, uh, me cursing.  Hoo-hoo.  I use characters. 
[03:41:30]  Like Mr. Imus.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Tits.  There, I said it.  Big, juicy daughter tits.  You can't say that yet.  You could say that in 2006.  2006.  Yeah.  How would you guys...  What am I going to be then?  Like, 60?  Come on.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Come on.  At least 55, I guess.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Come on.  Huh.  You were going to say something.  I was...  But then I realized that I don't want to tell the story about the suppository smashing me in the chest until another day. 
[03:42:00]  Why?  Because it's a gross way to end the show.  If I start telling you...  That is really disgusting.  ...how I had been calling this mistress who was going to come over and give me some full toilet training, as they say.  And then...  They have a name for it?  Full toilet training?  Of course they do, you silly goose.  Full toilet training.  And, um, I don't...  You don't want it ever, like...  I don't like suppositories or enemies and that stuff.  You want it to be natural.  What's the difference between full toilet training and, like, partial toilet training?  Well, one is only, uh, one is only one, and one is maybe number one and two. 
[03:42:30]  I'm just speculating.  You need it natural?  Yeah, who wouldn't?  You know, come on.  Of course.  What am I, a communist?  And, uh, I say no suppositories, and she comes over after using a suppository, and it shoots out of my chest and bounces on the bathroom floor.  Like, melted brown candle wax from five feet up.  No.  It's just...  Did it make a little tick-tick-tick sound on the bathroom floor?  I couldn't tell.  I was too busy going...  Holy...  You really have a problem.  We're getting into, uh, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today? 
[03:43:00]  Someone writes...  It's Taylor from, uh, Massachusetts.  Today I learned some retarded squash recipe from that ass they play during your commercials.  Are you guys serious with this crap?  They had a squash recipe when we took a break?  Um, Steve C. saying yes.  Yeah?  Yeah, well, you know, people, you used to listen to, uh, dick cream ads and whatnot, and, uh, that would go on for quite some time back in the old days.  I just think when we take our breaks and try to take our craps and get our coffee orders right and stuff, that we could utilize that time and play some really cool stuff. 
[03:43:30]  Mm-hmm.  It's all about keeping the listener.  Yeah.  I learned that a long time ago.  Radio school.  Just to keep the listener interested.  Keep them hanging in there.  Uh, I learned that Jim likes a camel toe.  He can see through a comforter.  Very nice.  Tiger Woods got married.  We forgot to talk about that.  But we kind of talked about that yesterday.  We did, yeah.  We talked about her being a golfer lover.  Yeah.  She loves the golfers. 
[03:44:00]  And her father has to say that my daughter, I did the best I could, and regardless, she married a golfer.  Every father's nightmare when his daughter brings home a golfer.  Walk down on the couch, you see him kissing with those big golfer lips.  Bringing that long shaft home with him.  And, you know, the kids are going to be, you know, not bad looking kids, I'm sure, but, you know, you're still going to see the golfer in them.  Every time you pose for a family photo, half golfers looking back at you. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, man.  Someday his playing days will be over, but he'll always be a golfer.  You can take the golf out of the tiger, but she can't take me.  No, stop.  Jesus.  What?  Uh, Doughboy from whackbag.com.  A great message board.  Great Opie and Anthony message board.  I learned the difference between drunks and the homeless by smell.  One smells like booze, the other smells like horse rectum.  True. 
[03:45:00]  This was a lot of fun today.  I think we're almost hitting our stride again.  Almost.  The beginning of the show was taken up by technical errors and us bitching about them.  Yeah.  My nose is tough, so I apologize today for myself being a bit off and cranky.  My head is great.  Levitra knows.  Oh, it made for great radio, though.  I don't know.  I felt like I was awful today, so I'll send that a call.  I've got to stay up now until 8 o'clock at night.  I can't go to sleep.  You want to come over?  This is...  Dump a suppository on my chest?  No, no, nothing.  I'm just...  I suck your cock. 
[03:45:30]  It's just like a massage.  You want to hang out, watch some TV?  This show was really dirty today.  Yeah, it was really dirty.  It was really dirty.  There's going to be days where it is and days where it's not.  It's going to be organic.  And however you feel like talking, you talk.  Like in a locker room.  Right.  Some days you'll talk sports.  The other days you'll try to talk sports while looking at the size of the package on that  new Asian kid that just came in out of the corner of your eye.  All right.  We talked about Tiger.  We talked about Tiger Woods.  We talked about baseball.  What about baseball?  I'm rooting for the Sox this year. 
[03:46:00]  Which has Boston fans just so pissed off at you.  Why?  That you can't even believe it.  Oh, the sports curse.  Because your sports curse.  Opie's sports curse is unsurpassed.  Yeah.  He's the worst.  You're going for the Yankees.  Jimmy's going for the Yankees.  Always.  Ben's going for the Sox.  All right.  What else?  We talked about the technology problems.  I write little thought stars in my little book here.  Little notes.  I like to be prepared for the radio show for once.  Did you write your name on the front of the notebook?  Greg's thoughts?  Greg's deep thoughts?  G-R-E-G-G-S. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, no parole for Lennon's killer.  Duh.  That's all we need to say there.  There you go.  Yeah.  He shouldn't be paroled.  Huh?  Wow, really going out on a limb there.  Yeah, I don't mean to take risks.  Taking some risks.  They say Yoko was very upset, obviously, but you couldn't tell by looking at the Asian  face.  Doesn't give away any emotion, does it?  Hey, what's that painting?  Oh, that's my Asian wife.  Oh, sorry.  This expression has not changed in four hours.  David, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, boys. 
[03:47:00]  What's going on, man?  Hey, John.  Listen, today I learned that if you take an animal, you get humilified.  You get what, sir?  Humilified.  Oh, all right.  Oh, humilified is another word, yeah.  Yeah, that was a new word we invented today.  We like inventing words.  Steve from Oregon.  Thank you, Steve.  Whoa.  Thank you.  Learn how to be rude, huh?  Henchman learned from Brooklyn, I learned that itching a roid feels really, really good.  Yes.  That dirty bob does lay in bed and scratch his filthy ass. 
[03:47:30]  Make your fingers smell for weeks.  I learned today Jim Norton is actually J-Lo, whiny bitch.  Kevin learned that Norton hates submissive slopes.  Oh.  I didn't quite say it like that.  Yeah.  Big bitch put it right up her ass.  Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.  Hey, Jay, what's going on, buddy?  How are you doing?  Good, Jay.  Great to have you guys back.  And I learned that Opie's the smartest man in America. 
[03:48:00]  Go Socks.  Go Socks.  Go Socks.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  Cool.  We're all just breathing, finally.  Well, my nose is stuffy.  I'm actually breathing very easily at all.  I learned.  I have one nostril to go, and I'm back to normal.  There you go.  I think tomorrow's the day.  Atta boy.  Tomorrow's the day.  He learned Voss needs a tampon behind one ear.  Gio, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Nervous Nelly.  It looks like a little... 
[03:48:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Start over.  Say it again.  You silly goose.  I learned two things, actually.  I learned that Opie's ass hair glistens in the shower, and I learned that Robin's pussy  looks like a wallet.  You open up a black leather wallet.  That's what it looks like.  Right, Robin?  That's where she keeps her money from the show.  In her black wallet.  We haven't talked to Sacramento yet. 
[03:49:00]  Brian, what's up?  It's Brad, Opie.  What is it?  How you doing, man?  Brian?  Brad?  What is your name?  Brad.  B-R-A-D?  Yeah.  Brad.  Brad.  I'm crippled with a high palate.  You have a cleft palate?  Yeah.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Do you have an awful, like, Dave wants that mustache to not hide it?  F you, Norton.  Would I?  Would I?  You have a...  Hair lip!  Hair lip!  Do you really have a cleft palate?  Yeah.  So what...  So what...  Why are you getting mad at me for just teasing it? 
[03:49:30]  I know you probably have, like, a thick, awful mustache, which has, like, a scar in the  middle of it, because all cleft palate mustaches...  Like Cheech?  ...have that lightning strike in the middle?  What did this guy do to you?  I don't know what to guess.  He called up saying, I have a cleft palate.  What am I supposed to do?  Pretend it's kissable?  Is it all fixed?  No, no.  Wait a minute.  You didn't...  You never got it fixed?  Well, I don't have straight teeth and stuff, but it's not...  No, it's not fixed.  Do you know what would help that?  If you put one end of a shotgun on it, and your toe on the other end.  Shut up.  So bad.  Blow that bad lip off and have them put some wax ones on there. 
[03:50:00]  Anyways, I want to put what I learned today.  All right.  What'd you learn?  I learned nothing, because it's too effing early over here.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you're in Sacramento.  It's very early.  Okay, very good.  Thanks, Brian.  I'm sorry I teased your freakishly misshapen lips, sir.  Make sure you listen to the replay.  That's going to start in, like, ten minutes, I think.  I'm sure nobody notices when you're face down in the pillow.  Holy shit.  You don't even know this guy.  Why would he mention that he had a cleft palate?  Yeah, that isn't something you just bring up in conversation.  I could kind of hear it, because cleft palate people always talk.  They're just trying to hang on and talk properly, because half of their gums are hanging out. 
[03:50:30]  There goes the cleft palate audience that we were trying to get.  We're losing the cleft palate audience.  I don't want you and your fucking horse gums listening.  You'll never work with Joaquin Phoenix for as long as you live.  That's right.  And the other one, what's his name?  Kareeb.  What's his name?  Stacey Keech.  Stacey Keech is another one.  And Cheech.  Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, color cane.  Stacey Keech.  Stacey Keech.  I didn't know Joaquin Phoenix had that.  Oh, yeah, you can tell.  So he was yelling, help, help, while his brother was breakdancing in front of the Viper a few years ago. 
[03:51:00]  Fucking faggot name.  It's a J, not a Y.  Hey, Joaquin.  Why are you so...  Help, help, help.  Why are you so worked up today?  V-lip motherfucker.  I'm tired and my nose is stuffed.  Help.  Help.  Help.  He can't breathe.  Help.  Neil, take a spray bath.  You're going after the easy targets today. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How can you not?  Everyone in Pittsburgh has a cleft palate.  Awful city.  I had nine people on every show with a fucking improv.  I didn't know this was a touchy subject with you.  How can it not be?  Because if he's a cleft palate, we're supposed to go, hey, you're brave, facing your injury.  Wow.  You know what you should do if you have a cleft palate?  Move to Alaska, because it's night for half the year, and people won't see it. 
[03:52:00]  I got to build an igloo.  I live in that.  Awful.  What would you do if you brought home a girl, and she had a cleft pussy lip?  You'd punch her in the stomach and kick her out.  You wouldn't talk to her like she was an eagle?  Stupid knife slash on the face lip.  Fuck off.  He's hurting me.  He's hurting me.  Oh, my. 
[03:52:30]  Imagine having to kiss that.  It's like this is a kiss.  But his little kiss is probably this.  Like that fucking half and awful.  Can I make out with the right side of the left tonight?  Holy ass.  Oh, that's got to be awful.  Hey, Doug, what's going on?  Hey, not much.  All right.  I learned this morning that if you really want to get back at somebody, you put gas in  their fuel tank.  Yeah, what an idiot I am.  Oh, very good.  Can't really show them.  He put it in regular instead of premium.  Oh, help, help. 
[03:53:00]  There's gas in my fuel tank.  Who punched you, son?  Oh, nobody.  I was born this way.  Ugh.  I'm sweating.  Where does this come from?  Always have to be careful you don't make B or P sounds when they go like this.  I'm a good boy.  I'm a good boy.  You're a good boy.  What is that?  Where does this come from?  What?  He really has a cleft palate problem.  I've known you for a long time.  Where did I just think of a cleft palate? 
[03:53:30]  I saw a guy.  It was at a Starbucks.  I was buying coffee one time.  Starbucks?  Yeah, Starbucks.  You want a nice, nice, nice.  I want anything as long as you don't speak.  Just nod.  Just nod.  If you have a cleft palate,  what you should be is a bank robber  because it's acceptable  to put a bandana  across the lower half of your face.  Bank robber in the 1800s?  That should be your  perfection of choice.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You know what they should say? 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  This should be every bit of dialogue  in a hospital.  Mr. and Mrs.  Fill-in name here.  Your boy slash girl  was born with a cleft palate  and the parents should respond,  so how did you euthanize it?  Wow.  Not to break it up,  look at Ozzie's daughter's tits. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, my God.  Is that Kelly?  Wow.  Kelly Osbourne's tits are good.  That's good.  Those are fat tits, though.  They're fat tits.  Yeah, but that's, you know, she still has youth with her, so it's okay.  Not really, man.  She has a good eight inches of cleavage.  Yeah, but she's wearing the low cut, so you're not paying attention to how awful the rest of her body is.  Yeah, but look at the cleavage behind Ben's head.  Anyone else notice that only the fat girls dye their hair like that?  No, you want to take the attention off of the body.  Fat girls like to dye their hair crazy colors so you don't notice how fat they are. 
[03:55:00]  She's got such a cute face.  Yes, that's not a bad suggestion.  So, by the way...  Those are nice.  Those are nice, though.  Nord, how much would you love to bang her just to say you banged her?  I would love to, but I also want to throw out the suggestion.  I don't want to say the name again, but if you're one of these people walking around with an unpleasant split lip,  dye yourself from the neck down a color like pink or yellow so people don't look at you above the shoulders. 
[03:55:30]  Jesus.  Wow.  I had no idea that was in you about those people.  I didn't either until he called up and offered that up.  I never thought about it before.  So you thought he wanted us to feel sorry for him?  No, I don't know why he said it.  If he walked in and had that, I probably wouldn't make any remark.  Because they could, guys, what am I going to do?  You know, how do you fight a guy like that?  This all happens after...  Hey, do you want a fat?  Forget it.  After the iced latte.  This all happens.  Yeah, I know.  Let's say hi to the henchmen.  What's going on, guys?  See, this is why we should do morning radio. 
[03:56:00]  Hey, man.  Because you're meaner.  He's all cranky.  I love the cranky ginormous.  Who knew there was a cleft lip?  You were too happy when we were doing afternoon radio.  I know you're not going to get mad at me for complaining about stuff.  I will.  Because believe me, I'm not going to mention anything, but someone is going to get it this  week.  Someone is going to get a good dose this week.  All right.  Henchmen, we didn't hear you, so start over.  Go ahead.  I guess I'm not going to tell you about my deviated septum, but...  No, that doesn't bother me, dude.  You don't have to look at that.  Today, I learned you guys have the audience and production values of college radio. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, that's so true.  One minute to go.  But it's six minutes off, Ben.  I know.  What if we want to just go late?  Yeah, what if we want to talk a few minutes?  Yes, Ben?  Well, it's up to Martini Steve.  We can't hear you, Steve.  It's not up to me at all, actually.  We can't hear you, Steve.  What do you say, Steve?  There are going to be some days we want to just continue.  There he goes.  Yeah.  Martini Steve.  All right.  Now, how many seconds left? 
[03:57:00]  One minute exactly.  I thought you said one minute, 20 seconds ago.  I said one and a half minutes.  Hey, Steve?  Yes?  Who is the sociopath with the buttons all the way up to the top done behind you?  Who is that?  He's the guy that's going to fix your goddamn headphones.  Oh, he's a frightening guy.  Now he's not.  Now he's not.  Thank you.  He's one of the tech guys that are going to straighten out this mess.  How do you normally get them in the car, sir?  With candy or a puppy?  Wow.  Hope he doesn't have a cleft palate. 
[03:57:30]  No doubt.  All right.  Well, should we just leave then?  Yeah.  How much time now, Steve?  We'll let him fix our electronics.  Exactly 20 seconds right now.  Hopefully we have, what, 20 hours to fix some of the stuff?  Well, we fixed a lot of things today.  Yeah, but hopefully they're not all screwed up tomorrow.  Like, when we get here, are we going to have to spend time trying to log into the computers again?  I'm hoping to get a password.  Are you?  Yeah.  We were a little more gooder today than yesterday.  A tad more gooder?  A tad more gooder. 
[03:58:00]  Getting gooder every day.  My password's going to be cleft palate.  How do you spell, ugh?  We're out.  Prepare to be wowed.  What mockers.  We're about Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow me.  We'll be right back. 
[03:58:30]  I went to Cancun for vacation about a year ago.
