<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Nick Wallenda's Grand Canyon tightrope walk.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton, reacted with profane commentary, focusing on Wallenda's frequent mentions of "Jesus" and the technical aspects of the walk, comparing it to Evel Knievel's stunts and criticizing ABC's use of safety wires in a previous walk.  Wallenda's family briefly joined the show for an interview.  The conversation then veered into a graphic discussion of the show *Naked and Afraid*, filled with vulgar descriptions of the contestants.  They then discussed upcoming guests: Bob Kelly, with a new food-based show, and Melanie Monroe, a Penthouse model who had challenged their capabilities.  The hosts made crude jokes anticipating her arrival and potential inclusion in their "bus trip" segment.  The conversation briefly returned to Wallenda, speculating on his fall contingency plan and then touched on a Canadian Supreme Court free speech decision, before moving into a lengthy, offensive discussion of Paula Deen's racial slur controversy and subsequent firing from the Food Network,  filled with racial slurs and sexually explicit language. One host then performed a self-surgery on a loose stitch, prompting more vulgar jokes. The segment ended with anticipation for Monroe's arrival and further discussion of Kelly's show.

The next segment started with planning for a "bus tour," including ideas like "naked karaoke."  A Black caller, Steve, engaged in a debate with the hosts about the N-word, its offensiveness, and its varying usage amongst different racial groups. The conversation expanded to media bias and racial dynamics in America.  Bobby Kelly joined the show in studio, graphically detailing his recent fatherhood experience, including the birth of his child and humorous anecdotes about newborn care.  Melanie Monroe was also expected as a guest.

The following segment focused on one host's dating difficulties, expressed with vulgar language, and their views on dating and relationships.  The discussion shifted to fatherhood and the hosts' desires to have children, touching upon one host's chaotic home life.  Nolani Monroe, a pornographic actress, arrived, and the conversation became intensely sexually charged.  Monroe discussed her career, sexual preferences, and fantasies, including "stepson" scenarios.  A significant portion involved an improvised, explicit role-play scene between Monroe and Bobby, and a studio employee, Edgar, was briefly involved in a non-consensual touching scenario with Monroe while blindfolded.  The segment ended with further discussion of Monroe's career and potential participation in the Opie and Anthony bus tour.

The final segment discussed the upcoming bus tour, including destinations like "Titty Mountain Highway," and recounted Opie's encounter with a partially exposed woman.  The conversation quickly became sexually explicit and crude,  featuring extensive discussions of genitalia and bodily functions, often involving references to Chip's mother and his sexual experiences.  The hosts struggled to keep the conversation appropriate with Melanie Monroe, who was present in studio.  The conversation shifted to upcoming comedy shows at Foxwoods, with discussion of acts and audience interaction.  They briefly mentioned their neighbor, porn star Brittany Andrews. The segment concluded with more sexually explicit discussion, personal anecdotes, plans for a future pool party, and promotion of Bobby Kellyâ€™s Travel Channel show and Foxwoods appearances, alongside comparisons to other comedians like Kevin Hart and Bernie Mac.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, Jesus.  It was a good show, Jesus.  Please, Jesus. Lord.  King of kings.  Lord.  Make this a good one, Lord.  Lord. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  Hallelujah.  Praise Jesus.  King of kings.  Please, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Give us a good show, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  You are Lord.  You are love, Jesus.  Make sure everything works, Jesus.  King of kings.  Jesus, please calm management.  Please calm management, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, Jesus.  Nick Wallenda blew it. 
[00:02:00]  That Jesus stuff was a bit uncomfortable.  That's the thing.  It's like everybody.  Maybe it would have been better that we didn't have a mite.  You think?  Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  Background music?  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, you didn't watch the walk?  What's wrong with you?  The whole world was watching.  Jim Northam.  I went online, actually, last night.  Yeah.  And after the fact?  I didn't know when it was on.  And I went and looked.  I looked up.  Tightrope across.  And every video I saw was promoting that it was going to happen. 
[00:02:30]  What time did it happen?  I looked at like nine something.  Yeah, it was happening around, what?  It was 24-minute walks on my dad?  9.40.  Oh, I was actually probably too early.  Okay.  Ah, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  The second he stepped out on that wire, it just started into the hallway.  Praise Jesus for this beautiful view, Jesus, what you have created, Jesus.  Thank you, Jesus.  Calm the winds, Jesus.  Please calm me down, Jesus.  Calm me.  Calm the winds, Jesus.  Jesus, you are the king of kings. 
[00:03:00]  You are the king of kings, Jesus.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  The whole fucking way.  Every step.  There was a Jesus, I believe.  Although, let's be honest, in that position, I guess that's the guy who you want to be on his fucking good side.  That's not where you want to have your fucking theological debate.  Right.  You know, I'm not too sure of the sort of bullshit.  You have a good point, because that was, I mean, the guy, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus the whole way is one thing.  But, man, that's pretty fucking amazing to be able to do that. 
[00:03:30]  It's easy to make fun of the Jesus stuff, but you're right, man.  I mean, that one view from pretty much a GoPro, what was the, how did they get that one shot?  Because he wasn't wearing anything on his head.  It was on his chest.  Was it on his chest?  Yeah, he had a camera there, but I think it also had like a prism.  Oh, okay.  So it could look down.  Oh, I got you.  But not have to stick out and down.  Because just seeing his chubby feet, Nick Willender's a bit on the chubby side.  He's a pudgy guy, isn't he? 
[00:04:00]  I want to see that.  They had video looking straight down.  Oh, it's crazy.  Was he wearing bell bottoms?  What the hell was that about?  And some faded bells.  Why would you risk anything getting caught in your fucking tightrope shoes?  Can you ever see cartoons?  If you fall off wearing bell bottoms, they act like parachutes.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And then you just ease yourself down.  I guess you don't really have to do a lot of cardio in the gym if you're a tightrope walker.  No, apparently not.  A bit of a pudge.  But when they were showing his feet, like you were just saying, just on the wire, looking 
[00:04:30]  straight down into the canyon.  Oh, my God.  Look.  Look at this.  Did you?  His jeans should have been fucking flood pants, don't you think?  That's where he started.  That's actually the start of the walk.  Yeah.  It's, you know, the Jesus stuff was a little rough.  But we could just play this in the background.  Tin, tin, tin, tin, tin.  It's only like two months.  I'm glad they had a delay, though.  It feels slippery.  There's dust on this cable.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's covered in it.  Tin, tin, tin, tin, tin, tin.  Well, he said there's dust on the cable, but he's going to keep walking. 
[00:05:00]  I would say, how about if somebody re-dusts the cable?  Dust remover.  Get out there.  Oh, my God.  Praise God.  This is awesome.  Awesome.  Praise God.  Oh, God.  I'll just go back right there.  Oh, my God.  He's way up there.  All you see is his feet sliding to step on the tightrope.  How's that dust on there right now?  Oh, it's all right.  Jesus put it there.  It's absolutely fabulous.  Yeah, Jesus cut a fart. 
[00:05:30]  What's that yellow thing mean?  He's pressing.  Those are just markers.  That's a pendulum.  Yeah.  You have these heavy pendulums there that kind of damper the way the thing was swinging.  As best they can.  It's moving that rope, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How heavy were the pendulums?  The cable reaction.  I'm not sure.  Oh, it's okay.  I should have known from hearing it 8,000 times.  Look at that view.  Holy.  Oh, my God.  What's he doing?  Fuck.  Why would you do that?  What's he doing?  Is that dizzying?  This is amazingly well done.  It's fucking amazing. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Discovery did a great job of this.  Absolutely great job.  Unlike those pussies.  What was it?  ABC?  Yeah.  Making them wear that fucking...  Skywire Live with Nick Willendry.  Just like fucking Evil Knievel would do, right?  Because we couldn't...  We watched Evil Knievel break every bone in his body.  Yes.  And we're still here.  Right.  Well, I mean, you know, this was the same guy that did the Niagara Falls walk, but he  had to have the safety wire on because of stupid ABC.  And he was polite about that during the preliminaries last night. 
[00:06:30]  He said, well, my TV partners at the last minute came to me and insisted.  Fucking lawyers fucking ruin everything.  Right.  Look.  I mean, these guys...  You know what his safety cable...  He could have pretty much ran across that damn thing.  You know what his safety cable is?  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You think he would have added Christ if he fell?  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  Praise Jesus.  King of Kings.  Oh, is there more?  I want to hear more of that audio.  There's only two minutes?  Is there more?  That's all he said. 
[00:07:00]  There's 20 fucking minutes of him praising Jesus and walking.  I want to hear Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Just blow your stuff down.  Is that the best version we can find?  No HD version.  Dude, that's so high up.  It's so crazy.  Oh, it was...  They have a view from the bottom, too, up, and he's a speck.  He's a dot.  He's a speck.  That's not nice, Ant.  Oh, speck.  Oh, you cut it down to this.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's fucking...  Fucking Sam just made it very easy for us, Jesus. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you, Jesus.  What's the helicopter for, Jesus?  Praise Sam.  Praise Jesus.  That brought him over to the other side, because he was on the one side, Jesus.  Right.  It brought him over there, praise Lord.  And then he walked back.  Right.  Praise Jesus.  Christ.  Oh, no.  Not the Christ part.  King of Kings.  I guess the Christ part makes it bad.  You're right, Jesus.  You can say Jesus a lot, but you can't say Jesus Christ.  Yes, Jesus.  Right?  Or something.  I don't know.  Calm the winds, Jesus.  Calm the winds.  And then the guy from Jurassic Park was watching him.  Right.  On the other side. 
[00:08:00]  That's his pop.  That's his pop.  That married it to the family, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't think he's ever fucking got out of wire in his life.  No.  He said, fuck that shit.  Look at that.  Isn't that amazing?  He is a dot.  I don't.  Like, look at how, like, what do you do if all of a sudden you wake up at that moment  and go, what am I doing?  What am I doing?  Yeah, you freak out.  I can't do this.  Yeah.  If you freak out.  But he said it during the pregame.  Basically, if he slipped, he would just, you know, grab onto that wire.  Unlike his grandfather who had weak muscles back then. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  And he would just wait for a helicopter to come get him.  Really?  With that fucking 30-pound thing around his neck?  That's what I was saying to him.  Like, if you do slip, then...  You probably know how to throw that thing right off of you.  You think?  I bet.  I don't know.  Look at that thing.  It's fucking swaying and moving.  What are those things sticking out from the sides of the pendulum?  It's hanging down.  You can't really see it.  It looks like it's coming off the wires, but it's actually on a pole behind him.  The pendulums are hanging down.  Yes. 
[00:09:00]  Swinging back the other way or what?  Swinging back the other way.  Well, I mean, usually they got those things fucking fastened.  Yeah.  But you can't fasten them because they're high above the Grand Canyon, obviously, so they  just weighed them down a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Shit.  Is that crazy?  That's dizzying.  That is fucking...  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Terrible.  Watching it here, it's dizzying.  Could you imagine being that guy, looking like that?  Right.  Just looking down, Jesus?  Oh, Jesus.  With his bell bottoms that are very close to his heels.  Why would you do that? 
[00:09:30]  Little chubby thighs.  Well, we're going to play it this way.  Oh.  Because we got it all edited nice for the people.  Praise Jesus.  Do you want to do that?  No.  Praise Sam.  Why couldn't you do this, Sam?  What's wrong with you?  You should at least try.  That's windy.  Look how windy that is.  Oh, yeah.  He asked Jesus to calm the wind.  Yeah, he did.  And Jesus did calm the wind.  Calm the wind's Jesus.  I'm glad Jesus...  Instead of working on the other problems in the world, he fucking calmed the winds for  a little time.  Yeah, a little time.  And then some asshole.  I went for a couple jokes on Twitter.  You know, he can do more than one thing at a time. 
[00:10:00]  Just go for a stupid fucking line.  A dumb...  And I'll admit it.  A stupid, dumb Twitter line ends up...  Yeah, you obviously don't know anything about Jesus.  Jesus.  Then I got Warren Sapp to tell me to stop it.  He goes, stop it.  Why was Warren Sapp...  Huh?  Warren Sapp told you to stop it? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Because one of my tweets...  It was just...  Everyone was making fun of Jesus.  The Jesus thing.  So I wrote, uh...  Yo, Jesus.  Solve the world's hunger problems or get Nick Willenda across the Grand Canyon.  It's your call.  That's great.  It's a dumb fucking quick Twitter joke.  So Warren Sapp writes, stop it.  I like how his gut was hanging on the fucking pole, too.  That was great.  He has a little gut kind of hanging on the pole there.  Wouldn't you want to be in incredible shape?  Oh, you'd think.  Because just walking that would be a little bit of a... 
[00:11:00]  You'd think you'd want to be.  With 30 pounds.  I mean, how...  What is that thing called?  The pole?  Yeah, it's a little pole.  How much does that weigh?  It's got to be heavy.  To keep you from falling off?  40 pounds?  43 pounds.  43 pounds.  So...  Look, his little ponch.  Yeah, he's got a ponch.  Did you hear the first thing?  He's E-rock fat.  As soon as he got off the rope, did you hear what he said he was going to do?  What?  Go get some prime rib.  Some prime rib, yeah.  He loves the prime rib.  In a martini glass, you think?  Whoa, look at that.  He was even fatter before, though, when he was walking all the other things. 
[00:11:30]  He watched the two-hour pregame to the pregame.  Dude, I blew it off after that.  I just went right to the walk.  He had titties when he was walking across Puerto Rico.  Yeah.  With his mom.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Where his mom decides she has to do it, too, and then...  Almost like she hasn't tightroped in a while, and then she just does it and sits down in  the middle, and he steps over her.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That was way more crazy than this, I think.  Oh, there's Jurassic Park guy telling him what's going on. 
[00:12:00]  He looks like Dennis from the Bunny Ranch.  Come on over.  I'm going to get you blown by three girls.  Just cross this fucking wire.  Oh, Jesus.  Praise you, Jesus.  Praise me, Jesus.  Praise you, Jesus.  Praise everyone, Jesus.  Look at that view.  He's a dot.  It's nothing.  You are so high up.  Oh, man.  Higher than the Empire State Building.  Why didn't he go across, like, where it's really wide?  Yeah.  This is a pussy move right here.  You want to get your bottle of water?  All right, here, here.  We got the highlights.  Can he drink water or no?  No.  How are you going to drink water? 
[00:12:30]  He got 20 minutes.  I guess he could have had, like, a Camelback or something on.  He probably didn't want to have any extra equipment.  Yeah, sure.  I would have put one of those fucking hats on with the fucking two beers.  Yeah.  Just be the party type.  That's right.  Look at how fucking much that thing is.  There were a couple times the pole really went over one way.  What does that mean, like, if that happens?  Is he in danger of falling?  I guess he's trying to balance himself, but.  It's windy.  Yeah, it was very windy.  Praise Jesus.  Yeah.  I think that 40-pound pole really keeps you fucking all nice and tight. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, without that, there's a fat guy at the bottom of that fucking ravine right now.  I think you should have to do these things without the pole.  Pole-less, yeah.  Pole-less.  Wow, that's fucking crazy.  So they got a category where they go pole-less?  I don't know.  I guess.  They put their arms out?  Right.  Go pole-less.  Whoa, whoa.  Or ride a little bicycle across like this.  Oh, my God.  Would you ride a bicycle across that?  Me and Ann were talking again about this shit, because then there was another guy like.  Oh, he was an asshole.  Another guy's like, oh, the wire's as wide as his feet. 
[00:13:30]  Not impressed.  Not impressed.  And I wanted to write the guy back.  I'm like, then you do this.  I told him.  Me and Ann were talking.  If there was a sidewalk across that with no fucking wind, and they said, look, go ahead,  go walk across the Grand Canyon on this sidewalk.  On the sidewalk.  I bet you fucking 90 out of 100 would say, get the fuck out of here.  No way.  No way.  And it took him almost 25 minutes.  Can you imagine being 10 minutes into doing this?  Yeah.  And not even being halfway done yet.  Oh, you're just petrified. 
[00:14:00]  And why is that Joel guy there?  What's his name?  Joel Osteen.  Oh, that's right.  He helped him pray before, right?  Praise Jesus.  He was helping him praise Jesus.  Well, how about Osteen help some fucking homeless people somewhere?  You think?  He's running up.  You can't see him running, because they have the fucking graphics.  Oh, my God.  Yes, at the end.  At the end, he decided to give it a good run.  Right.  And he kissed the ground.  No, he kissed some dude's foot.  Oh, he did?  Okay.  He kissed a black man's foot.  Was it a black man?  There he is.  His wife's refusing to hug him.  Like, watch your mouth. 
[00:14:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  He's, uh...  Praise Jesus.  I know.  All right, here we go.  Nick steps up and notices the view.  So we got just the highlights right here.  All right.  From the 20...  How many?  24 minutes?  It was 2250-something.  Wow.  2250.  You would never do that for a minute?  I couldn't even sit there.  I was laying in bed watching it.  Is that uncomfortable?  That's uncomfortable to look at.  Oh, I was freaking out.  I'm glad those aren't my feet.  No.  Of course.  It's really impressive, obviously. 
[00:15:00]  I was so tense watching it.  I figured that, like, he had this, because I watched him practice.  I was like, this is going to be stupid when it's on, because he knows what he's doing.  Right.  But then once he started, and he was like, I didn't think this rope was going to be this  shaky.  I was like, oh, no!  Oh, come on.  And then when they show the view where he's a little speck, or that sweeping shot, where  it looks like everything is moving incredibly fast around him.  Yeah.  Like, it shoots him from behind, and you're like, he's got so much more to go.  Right.  I know.  Just to look.  But I think he blew with the Jesus thing, because that's all anyone's talking about, 
[00:15:30]  is Jesus.  Praise Jesus.  Jesus, King of Kings.  It's like, well, what about, holy shit, look what this guy just did.  Yeah.  And people were asking on Twitter, this or Evel Knievel, you've got to go Evel Knievel  every fucking time.  Yeah.  With that spaceship thing.  That was so dumb.  Evel Knievel, though, he just designed stunts.  That he was like, all right, I'm going to break some bones, but I'm not going to die.  Right.  Well, he didn't care.  I know I'm not going to make it.  Well, the new stuntman's got it all figured out. 
[00:16:00]  They go on the computer and everything and figure out every little nuance of the stunt.  Evel Knievel and those guys were like, I don't know, well, maybe move the ramp just  a little.  Give me another 10 feet, I think.  I think.  It looks like.  Yeah, they didn't figure it out on a computer.  Well, that's what he was saying, too, in the pre-show, that now they have meters on  the rope, so you can tell exactly how much tension is on it by the pound and everything.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then, except when his great-grandpa did it and fell, back then, they would just  kind of flick the rope with their finger and say, yeah, that's tight. 
[00:16:30]  Ding, ding, ding.  Look at that fucking view.  The worst part of his grandfather dying was the comb-over.  His comb-over went wacky.  He was trying to grab the wire.  His little chubby legs are rubbing together.  He is a fat guy.  Those yellow things would freak me out if I was walking.  It's like, that shouldn't be there.  Yeah, those are the pendulums and the markers, I guess.  They've marked pretty much, I think, every 10th or something, was it? 
[00:17:00]  Well, they said there's like a pendulum every 50 to 75 feet, I think.  Right.  What is he looking at?  He was counting them.  Is he looking down, or is he looking straight ahead?  I think he's looking right ahead.  He said, yeah.  He said the pendulums were fucking him up, too, because you see the canyon wall that he's  walking towards.  And then the pendulums were going back and forth, and it would give that illusion that  the wire was moving.  So he's looking, and had this optical illusion that he was actually moving back and forth,  and the pendulums were staying still.  So he...  Oh, my God.  And how do you figure that out mid-walk? 
[00:17:30]  He just had to fucking figure it out.  Jesus helped.  Jesus actually helped.  Jesus wouldn't do that.  Here's Nick stepping up and noticing the view.  Oh, that's a view there, buddy.  Hey, praise God.  This is awesome.  Awesome.  Thank you, Jesus, for this beautiful view.  God is an awesome God.  Remember to slow up your steps just a little bit.  He's a coach.  Is that Jesus?  Table reaction all right?  That's his dad.  It's okay.  It's not my favorite, but... 
[00:18:00]  All right.  Praise you, God.  Why is he kneeling?  He took a little break because of the wind and the wire is oscillating.  He loves Jesus.  He loves Jesus.  Yeah, it got a little windy, so he decided to kind of almost sit down on the wire.  It was actually...  The wire started oscillating a little back and forth.  If he keeps the same rhythm as he's walking, the wire will start like a swing.  It'll just start going more and more, so he's got to break step and just stop for a minute  and let the wire calm down. 
[00:18:30]  I would start running and panic and just fall.  You think you'd panic and just want to run?  You just throw the pole like half a minute.  Throw the pole, start running.  You fucking make it a half a step and you're off the wire.  Wow, he really fucking stopped, though.  And then like a minute and a half in, he just said, no, I don't want Willie Geist talking  to me.  Did you hear him?  He goes, I don't want anybody talking to me.  Oh, he did.  Because the hosts were supposed to kind of talk to him.  Hey, how you doing up there, buddy?  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  As soon as he got up there, he was like, hey, Dad, I don't want anybody talking to me 
[00:19:00]  up here.  Yeah, good for him.  Good for Nick Walenda.  Just the wire, guys.  I'd be asking him, like, what the fuck, Nick?  How high is that, right?  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  Stupid questions.  Look down.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  All right.  So then Nick is not happy with the cable, but Jesus has his back.  I'm trying to get a shot of your feet so I can see what the cable's doing underneath.  Well, it's just getting some reverb in it.  Thank you, Jesus.  Thank you, Jesus.  I think by the time you get to the next pendulum, some of that's going to come out. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, I praise you, Jesus.  Oh, I praise you, Jesus.  He just loves Jesus.  Lord, help this cable to calm down.  Oh.  Command it in your name, Jesus, with the authority of God.  Praise you.  Praise you, Jesus.  The authority of God.  Come on, fine.  You're handling it good, Nick.  Praise you, Jesus.  Jesus, calm the cable.  He's got a little more movement with that one, but you're handling it just fine.  Under the co-signing of God. 
[00:20:00]  The authority of Christ.  The authority of Christ.  Praise you, God.  Wow.  That's his, I mean, that's the fucking, the chant.  That's his mantra.  It's a mantra.  Whatever that is.  A mantra, yes.  Yeah, I get that.  The law of Wagba.  Yeah.  The law of Wagba.  Praise, if I look down and saw my tootsies on a wire, I would be fucking singing to Jesus  too.  You're a good egg, Christ.  Thanks a million.  Sorry about those holes in your hand.  Thanks a lot.  You saved me.  You bled for me. 
[00:20:30]  Good for you.  Thank you.  As soon as I hopped off, where's a chick who has extra?  Who has extra?  Wow.  Praise Jesus.  Praise his name.  Yeah, this is the sweeping shot.  Look.  It makes everything.  It just makes everything.  Dizzying.  Dizzying.  It looks like it's flying by him.  That is a great shot.  They go around him with the helicopter, and then they kind of keep going once they pass a certain  point.  Is there a helicopter?  You can really see where he is.  Yeah.  Then it's pulled back.  He's shot beautifully.  He's helpless.  Looks great.  He's totally alone.  Look, look, look, look.  He's in the middle of nowhere. 
[00:21:00]  Dude, you're watching a guy.  Holy fuck.  Look, he's just a tiny little speck.  Oh, my God.  He's saying fuck you to death for 22 straight minutes.  That's crazy.  Praise Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Without a doubt, it's crazy.  Praise Jesus and God's authority.  Fuck, I wish I knew when this was on.  I thought I missed it and that you just couldn't get the video.  It was great, and it was only on a 10-second delay, so.  But just the fact that it's like.  And they said that's just, you know, standard TV shit, I guess.  I think it was on a longer delay, dude.  I saw one tweet from a breaking news guy that was there, and he said, he says, Nick has squatted 
[00:21:30]  down on the wire while the wind calms down.  And I swear to you, like, 10 minutes later, that is when he squatted.  It was very weird.  I don't know.  I don't know what the guy was fucking.  The show was about 10 minutes?  Yeah, it was a long time.  Wow.  Because when I saw him squat, I'm like, wait a minute.  That guy said that fucking a while ago.  And then you just tell everyone, nah, it's only a 10-second delay.  Yeah.  What do you do if your asshole itches?  Oh, you just wait until you hit the other side. 
[00:22:00]  How do you look?  Praise Jesus.  You have to ask Jesus.  You can't get one of the Jesus fingers.  Jesus, scratch my asshole under the authority of God.  Right.  Praise him.  King of kings.  Scratch my bunghole.  The devil's tail is tickling my hand in Jesus.  The devil's tail.  I have one of the devil's horns in my asshole, please, Jesus.  Dude, just try not to itch for 22 minutes.  Oh.  Even worse, you get that weird little itch on the nose there.  We have to.  You're probably so distracted, though.  Yeah.  Right.  Itches don't bother you.  That would drive me nuts, though. 
[00:22:30]  This is going to fucking give me more anxiety.  It's terrible.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  It's crazy.  Nick is still talking to Jesus, but doesn't want as many updates from his dad.  Oh.  How I love you, Jesus.  How I love you.  You're my king.  You're my savior.  You're my protector.  You're my shield.  You're my strength.  This is everything.  Beautiful shot, Nick.  You're an amazing God.  The only God.  How is the dust on your feet now? 
[00:23:00]  It's all right.  Okay.  Thank you, Lord.  Thank you for coming that cable, Lord.  Thank you, God.  You didn't know how to think.  Thank you, Satan.  That's my savior.  That's Jesus.  Isn't that a new hit show on CBS?  That's my savior?  No.  No, it's a little dusty, but take in a nice deep breath.  Okay.  You're 16 minutes on the wire.  Doing great. 
[00:23:30]  Okay.  You don't have to tell me how long I'm on the wire.  Oh, boy.  All right.  All right.  All right, Mr. Fancy Pass.  Fine.  Get in the background with him.  Fine.  Hi, Mr. Fancy Pass.  Fine.  Look, asshole.  I'm just trying to help you here.  Fuck you.  Fall.  What do you want me to tell you?  I hope you slip.  You're the one on the road.  All right, Mr. Needy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I figured you might want to leave Jesus alone.  He heard you the first time.  Right.  And then he finishes the walk. 
[00:24:00]  He's doing good.  Oh, my arms are tired.  I'm sure they are.  I won't tell you how long you've been.  Oh, that's a long way down.  Maybe in the real I shouldn't look down when you do what I do.  It is a long way, but you're conquering it.  Remind me of a true artiste today.  I don't know about that. 
[00:24:30]  Did he just thumbs up on the wire?  Yeah.  Thank you, Lord.  You're cocky, dummy.  Wow.  It's a long way down.  Yeah, it is, but you take your time.  I am.  That's when he started running.  He should have done that the whole time.  Yeah.  Cocksucker.  But it seems like it's easier to do it that way because you've got the nice wide foot.  It's always sideways.  That's pretty crazy, man.  Without a doubt.  He's probably a lot stronger than he looks. 
[00:25:00]  To be able to do that for fucking 22 minutes, balance yourself.  Right.  How much did he make for that?  I don't know.  A couple mil?  A couple mil, probably.  That's what kind of deal.  Holy fuck.  Jesus.  Now he wants to do a couple skyscrapers.  Philippe Petit did that back in 1970.  I want to say four, right?  After you do the Grand Canyon, you pretty much blew your load.  70.  No, it was Twin Tower shit.  So when was Philippe Petit's?  72, I want to guess.  I'm guessing 72, 70.  No, no, no.  Maybe 74. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I want it with 74.  But that's what he wants to do next.  And Mayor Bloomberg will never allow him to fucking walk between two, you know, fucking skyscrapers.  You don't think, no?  Without major safety shit.  And how much distance is it between two skyscrapers?  A block.  Yeah.  Right?  But what?  That's like four football fields.  Unless you go from the top of one to the top of another over other buildings.  That would be sick.  Willie Geist hugged him.  I guess you have to.  If the guy wants to hug you, you hug him.  Willie Geist had tight pants on.  He certainly did.  Look how tight his pants are.  I can see his penis, Jesus. 
[00:26:00]  Praise Jesus.  Jesus, his helmet is offending me, Lord.  Lord, please protect me from Willie Geist's penis, Jesus.  Help me, Lord.  It's pretty emotional.  I think it's a put-on.  My arms are aching.  Yeah.  He's wiping his eyes, like, for 20 minutes.  I want you to strain those arms any further.  He's going to go and yell at Christ while the things that went wrong.  That's why you make me tell you go down to the wire.  Thanks for the win, Dick.  Readjust.  Get the balance.  Were you nervous?  Well, I was building a huge rhythm in the cable.  And I had to sit down to hopefully take that rhythm out. 
[00:26:30]  That was the only thing I could do is what happens, as I talked about it, you can put  a rhythm in that cable.  And if I didn't go down and kept walking, it was just getting worse.  And it was totally an optical illusion.  You know, you guys talked about it leading up to this.  And the fact that those pendulums swinging this way, and the cable moving this way, and  a wall that's solid, really was confusing for me to see, to have anything to focus on  that I can counterbalance off of.  Were you fatigued by halfway point?  It looked like you were getting tired.  I was fatigued until I was three-quarters of the way all across. 
[00:27:00]  And then it was just all adrenaline.  I could tell when you stopped thanking Jesus and started thanking people like the Discovery  Channel, you were probably feeling...  That's pretty funny.  No, Willie Giles is going to be a rock star, man.  We want to bring your family in, if that's okay.  Come on over, guys.  Who's your buddy?  As much congratulations as anybody here.  This is Evita Amadeus Yanni and Erendira.  Erendira, how are you feeling after the war?  Dumb names.  Oh, I'm so relieved.  I can finally, like, breathe in.  Were you nervous when you saw him just kind of take a breath and step down to the wire? 
[00:27:30]  I had no idea what was going on.  I saw him go to the wire, and I was like, oh, no.  I started freaking out because I didn't have to knock the wire.  I think his son was like, I'm going to be on TV.  I'm going to wear my fucking Superman.  Superman.  Man of steel, motherfucker.  I bet the father doesn't like that because Jesus is more powerful than Superman.  The son doesn't think so.  No.  But I'm here.  I can finally stop with the Jesus nonsense.  I can't believe how dry it was out there.  Did that come into play as you were walking across? 
[00:28:00]  Was dust kicking into your eyes?  There was dust.  I mean, definitely my contacts are filled up with dust right now.  Oh, that's why he's wiping his eyes.  My mouth is so dry, I feel like I walked in the desert for three weeks, not 20 minutes.  Sounds very religious.  Just over 22.  I'll have to get the official word from your dad.  He was counting.  He was a little bit over 22, but not much.  It helped that you ran at the end.  You may have some time.  Yeah, that totally helped me at the end.  Hey, kids.  What's it like watching your dad cross a line like that?  It's amazing watching him do this because no one else ever even thinks of doing this. 
[00:28:30]  By the way, 2254 was your time.  I think about it.  Me too all the time, liar.  I'm suing him.  This is when they were trying to stretch for time.  See, they were trying to get the 1020 really, really.  I don't know.  Dickhead had to run at the end.  Yeah.  I guess you're used to it at this point, right?  Yeah.  She just wanted to be in front of the camera.  This is not easy to watch your dad do this, is it?  No.  You're always happy when it's over.  Yeah.  Well, you got a lot of celebrating tonight. 
[00:29:00]  Let's bring Mom and Dad in.  Come on in, Terry.  Delilah.  They had nothing at the end of this.  What were you seeing as safety coordinator?  Those wins were proud of.  She keeps interrupting.  You know, it was.  I mean, the wins really kicked up again.  Why are you dressed like Hannibal Lecter at the end of the movie?  I mean, old friend for dinner.  Cable started reacting a little bit different than we had hoped.  But, you know, again, Nick and I talked through the whole time, you know, what was going on.  And he earned every step. 
[00:29:30]  I knew that he would.  But, you know, he performed like that.  And then dramatically, he has to go off by himself.  He saw that.  And look over the edge and stand there for a moment.  You know, with every walk, the first step, I mean, there's always that.  Talk to the mom.  She walks herself.  Yeah, this guy don't fucking, he walks to the fucking early birth special.  That's what I was telling you.  They went back to the spot where the grandfather died and redid it.  Nick Melinda did the walk.  I was confident. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, he did.  They all walked at one point, but this dad hasn't walked in like 30 years or something.  Oh, the dad used to walk.  He did walk at one point.  Your husband is across, excuse me, your son is across safety.  And finally said, fuck that.  He was much thinner.  Well, I'm feeling wonderful.  I was very respectful.  Like Terry said, I knew he was working for every step he took.  Wait, that's the mom?  Yeah.  As compared to other walks, worse, better.  They're all, they're wrecking.  Niagara, we had to work too, but this, it just seemed like he was really working harder. 
[00:30:30]  Praising God.  You know, having a moment with the Lord.  It looks like he's taking a piss.  Yeah, it probably is.  He's showing his cock to some.  Satan works for a frost.  Suck this, bitch.  Some Navajo Indian.  A lot of people celebrating online, as you can imagine.  So, let's go over to Chris Jacobs, who is checking all of the social media reaction on Discovery.com.  Chris?  Wow, that was just amazing, man.  Pretty fucking amazing.  Very impressive.  You see, they showed how the cables are laid in there.  Like, they fucking drill massive fucking holes at an angle in the ground. 
[00:31:00]  And then put cables in there and then pour cement in there.  And there's like six of those that go up to a big turnbuckle with two and then one.  It's fucking amazing.  Like the Virozano.  Yeah, it's like really, because they've got to anchor it somewhere.  Well, the Indians want it all put back to how it was, though.  Our land must be.  That was a stipulation.  Put them back.  Yeah, the Indian guy came out at the end and gave him a bolo tie.  I saw that.  I was like, oh.  Yeah, but then Nick gave him some dumb Empire State Building statue.  Empire State Building thing.  You get it for what?  Four bucks in the gift shop? 
[00:31:30]  Nick said, this is what we did with your land.  Yeah.  You did nothing with it.  Here's what we did.  Yeah, you get a bolo tie.  Thanks.  Yeah, some guy on Twitter said, he goes, oh no, the Indian doesn't know he just sold the Grand Canyon.  That's like a smart ass.  Yeah, very fun.  Praise Jesus.  Dude, that is King of Kings.  Praise Lord.  King of Kings.  Under the authority.  King of Kings.  Under the authority of God.  Oh, Jesus.  Praise God.  Praise Jesus.  I like everything he does. 
[00:32:00]  Yes.  When he was putting it together, he was like, the wind needs to calm down.  Jesus controls the wind.  Jesus, I hope you will control this wind.  You can control that spirally wind in fucking Texas.  No kidding.  Texas.  He let that wind a blow.  Oklahoma.  He had no desire to stop that wind now.  Yeah, praise God.  Praise Jesus.  Under the sponsorship of God Incorporated. 
[00:32:30]  And of course, another person.  Don't you realize it's our responsibility?  It's dope.  It's a free will thing.  It's like, I understand the basics of everything, yes.  But you can kind of throw some of the basics out to get a stupid fucking tweet joke out.  Oh, wow.  Ricky Gervais tweeted something like, after all, the Jesus thinking he's doing, Nick Willenda  must feel silly for doing all that practicing. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, he's quite the atheist.  Oh, praise Jesus.  That tightrope shit is pretty impressive.  But I think you've got to shut the door on it now, because what else could he do?  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  The building thing.  I mean, Philippe Petit did it.  And the cool thing about Philippe Petit, he didn't ask any permission, which made everyone  go, holy fuck, what is this guy doing?  He was a godless fuck, though, you know.  True.  Was he?  Yeah.  Now you get praise Jesus, praise Jesus, going across Manhattan. 
[00:33:30]  But what else could he do?  Like they said, we're going to reveal what he's going to do next.  And then the skyscrapers is like, oh, OK, that's not as impressive as what he just accomplished.  Which ones?  He should do the ones in the Petrosian Towers or whatever.  Like, you've got to find equal height buildings.  How about he does R2 buildings, and he could bring you lunch.  Oh.  I'll buy lunch, and he could bring it over to your buildings.  Oh, nice. 
[00:34:00]  That would be lame.  But there's nothing he could do in New York that comes close to the Grand Canyon thing.  What could he do?  I don't know.  What would he do in New York?  Cross the river and go to Jersey.  Maybe go to Jersey?  Yeah, but it's not as...  Even though you know it, it's the Grand Canyon.  Like, there's nothing else he could possibly do.  I guess just because of the showbiz aspect of New York.  There'd be more people there.  And there'd be a building you could...  If you could fall 1,000 feet, that's still pretty cool.  Yeah, but it was three football fields officially? 
[00:34:30]  Four.  Four.  He just did four football fields.  He's going to do two skyscrapers in New York?  Well, Philippe Petit went back and forth, too.  And laid down completely on the wire.  And he didn't have the fucking whole...  And he had a team doing it, but they had to fucking shoot an arrow to get the wire across.  And they didn't have any pendulums.  They had no idea what the tension of the wire was.  The documentary's good, because, unfortunately, there's no real video, man.  But they explain how they snuck in with all this equipment.  Then they had to shoot an arrow to the other side with a little, tiny little rope, obviously. 
[00:35:00]  And then they used that rope to get bigger ropes and then eventually get the wire across.  And then they just hoped they could find a way to fasten it.  Yeah.  They took it across with a helicopter this time.  They had a rope.  And then they took that across.  And then the cable, they pulled that across.  And did someone get in that little metal box to put the pendulums in place?  Yeah, yeah.  A little metal box on fucking pulleys.  Could you even do that?  No.  Wait, do they...  I don't think so either, man.  What metal box?  There's a little metal box they showed. 
[00:35:30]  I guess that was a way they might rescue them as well.  Or if the helicopter couldn't do it.  Yeah, and then they just, you know, with pulleys on the little box and they'd go and put a pendulum where it needs to be.  There was somebody who went across that already on a box?  Yeah, and a little...  Did you have video of that?  I would love to see that.  They didn't show them actually doing it.  They didn't want it to take away from the amazingness of Jesus.  Of Jesus, right.  Praise.  Praise.  Praise everything he has done for everybody.  What made that go across?  I think people actually were pulling with a rope. 
[00:36:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  No, I couldn't do that.  Was the box exposed and open, or were you just...  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was almost like a window washer time.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You know, like to put on the side of the buildings?  You wouldn't take a ride in the metal box across even?  No, praise Lord.  No.  That's just...  I have trouble on the sky thing in Hershey Park.  I don't think I could do over there.  No.  I don't like the fucking train at Newark.  That little, uh, the tram. 
[00:36:30]  You don't like the little tram?  That makes me nervous.  We might fall over.  Yeah.  Oh, George, George, George.  This is good.  Go ahead, George.  Go ahead, George.  Morning, boys.  Morning, George.  Go ahead.  Could you just imagine if he landed a swum of bees while he was up there?  That would be the worst thing ever.  A bird?  Or a bird taking a shit on the wire.  A pesky bird pecking at his head. 
[00:37:00]  Pecking like Tommy boy.  Oh, God.  Bees would be fucking...  Bees would be...  He's just...  He can't swat at him.  He's just gotta be like, ah...  Wouldn't swat.  Walking across the wire going, ouch.  Ow.  Well, you know, he probably wouldn't bother him because he'd be so calm.  The bees would probably be all on his wire.  Like, this is the calmest guy we've ever fucking encountered.  Yeah, look at this guy.  Yeah.  Flinching.  He's trying to hold a grape Fanta soda with one hand while bees land on it. 
[00:37:30]  Jesus, praise Jesus.  Please take these bees away, Jesus.  Well, bravo to the Discovery Channel for allowing this to happen without the safety wire.  Oh, my.  Like stupid ABC.  Like pussies.  They're fucking lawyers.  Isn't that sickening?  The Disney lawyers?  Well, our point at the time was then don't do it.  Right.  The guy doesn't want a safety wire.  You're insisting he does it.  And they probably tricked him into it somehow with the contract.  Uh-huh.  And Discovery turned around and said, look, what do you want to do next?  He says, Grand Canyon.  No safety wire. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Let's sign the fucking contract.  Yeah, Discovery don't care.  Remember ABC like all like, oh, my God.  It's like, no, no, oh, my God.  It's because nothing can happen to the guy.  He falls.  He just hangs there and waits for a helicopter.  Yeah, they were trying to make it that it was death defying.  And it's like, no, it's, you know, you got to have a set of balls just to be up there.  But don't make it sound like he's going to fall into the water.  It's just not going to happen.  Nah.  And I don't think he used the whole Jesus thing.  Was he might?  No, he was saying Jesus.  I don't remember him saying Jesus like he was saying Jesus last night. 
[00:38:30]  Well, he had a fucking wire on.  That's why he's playing hockey.  Right.  Go ahead.  Make me fall.  I dare you.  Right.  He is a religious dude.  David Blaine was sending him love last night.  David Blaine is trying to fucking get in on the action.  That's my homeboy, David Blaine.  What's he going to do?  I think his next stunt, he's going to stand in a circle and hope that he doesn't step outside the circle.  Right.  I think that's his next stunt, if I'm not mistaken.  He's walking on a sidewalk and not step on a crack. 
[00:39:00]  Right, exactly.  Whose mother's back could be broken if he steps on.  What?  David Blaine's a hack.  He started doing morning zoo radio bits.  Yeah.  He's a hack.  You see him getting electrified?  Yeah.  We did that.  Amazing.  We did that.  Remember the girl that just sat there and was electrified?  Yeah.  I did that when I was eight at the science museum.  Right.  But he does a whole thing about it. 
[00:39:30]  Couldn't have been less dangerous.  No.  He's a hack.  I like his street shit.  A lot of that stuff's set up, too.  And he always makes it seem like he's on the brink of death when he's done.  Oh, yeah.  Like he collapses.  He's...  Well, I can't...  Oh, my God.  I was in the ice cube.  Right.  Fucking shut up.  I don't want to tell everyone it's actually really warm in there.  It's warm in there.  Because my body, he kept me warm.  It's like being an igloo.  But we need the people to think that I'm frostbite now.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, God.  His hamstrings retire.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's his deal, is that he can stand...  He can be uncomfortable for long periods of time.  Who cares?  Nick Wallenda wasn't breaking down crying and needing an ambulance to take him away.  No.  Yeah, even though he only did it for 22 minutes,  I'll bet that was significantly more uncomfortable than standing up for four days.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know, man.  I think the jury's still out.  He thinks so.  Yeah, that's right.  Halfway through, you just probably get that anxiety that you want to rush.  You want to get done. 
[00:40:30]  You're in the middle of this fucking span.  What are you going to do?  It's crazy.  Oh.  Insanity.  Dude, I want to cross the Grand Canyon in a helicopter, and I was out of my mind.  In a stupid helicopter.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine just standing up there on a wire?  You were in...  Dumb.  You were panicking in the rescue vehicle.  Yeah, yeah.  The thing that took him to the other side of the canyon.  Like, that's the safe thing.  Right.  Oof.  Yeah.  Very impressed.  He had to take a helicopter just to fucking get to the wire.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  When he was in Puerto Rico, I don't know if this is it or not, he's like...  Yeah, this is it, right?  This is...  He's in Puerto Rico, and he's crossing the wire, and he's wearing a shirt that's buttoned  up the front, and it's open.  Uh-huh.  It's like the wind is just going to be blowing his shirt.  Flapping it.  Why would you do it?  Show Jimmy the...  Yeah, he practices...  Oh, is that what he does with fans?  They put big fan motors on him so he could get the wind.  Yeah.  Yeah, here it is. 
[00:41:30]  This is the...  This might be a montage.  I don't know if it'll be on it.  Even to the point where when I was a child and I was...  Yeah, this is all just...  Okay.  Shh.  Is that the one where his grandfather fell?  Uh-huh.  He went back and did it with his mom.  His mom decided she needed to do it, too.  So they were walking toward each other.  Could you find that clip, possibly?  Maybe.  That was maybe crazier than what we saw last night.  And then what did they do when they met him?  You move over.  You move over.  She freaking sits down on the wire.  And she's a chubby, older woman now. 
[00:42:00]  And he steps over her.  And he steps over her.  It's crazy.  Get the fuck out of the way, Ma.  There it is.  Is that...  Yeah, this might be it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Look.  There's Mommy.  Mommy's on the wire.  She sits and then leans down.  She's sitting would be hard.  And then watch.  He has to step over her.  Whoa.  Yeah.  And she has to bend down and sit down.  She's a woman of a certain age at this point.  Right.  It's crazy.  And now he's stopped.  Now watch.  Is he stopping so she can get up?  Probably, yeah.  And then she's got to figure out how to get back up. 
[00:42:30]  How do you even get back up?  Look.  She balances with her one leg.  How do you get up?  The pole is very important at this point, I would think.  Oh, my God.  Mom is panicking.  Get up, you old bag.  You've got to counterbalance.  How the fuck on a cable do you stand back up after?  Oh, my God.  That's some fucking strength.  She has strong legs.  And you know that people, you know she didn't fall because you don't hear horror gasps.  That is amazing. 
[00:43:00]  And then they both start walking again.  How crazy is that?  And he has a camera on the end of his stick.  Right.  His pole.  Yeah, his pole has a camera.  Cam on his pole.  And family's been doing this since, like, the 20s.  Yeah.  Seven generations, Sam Roberts.  But Disney made him wear a wire.  That's disgraceful.  Yeah.  That's literally like a black guy doing a stunt and them going, hey, could you fucking  put on this mammy hat?  How humiliating that is.  Yeah.  That's what that's like.  Mammy hat.  You know what I mean? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  This is what you've been, your family's been doing this, and we're stepping in saying  wear a wire.  Yeah, I think I got it.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, I know what I'm doing.  I'm going to get it.  Sniper's on either end of the tightrope to shoot down birds.  Oh, are they?  No, there weren't.  There's no way that's true.  This guy is such a fucking liar.  Well, let's see.  I love liars.  Rich, you're lying.  No.  Seriously.  It's the windage and the Coriolis of the Earth movement. 
[00:44:00]  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Snipers to shoot at birds.  That sounds safe.  Yeah, I think the Navajo Indians would allow that.  Is it Navajo over there?  Oh, Navajo.  Yeah, I think they got some Navajo.  They got some Hopi.  Oh, they got a few Hopi Indians.  Oh, they got the Hopis?  Yeah.  Nice.  And, yeah, the guy came up and gave him a little time.  You've been to the Grand Canyon, right? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  How cool it is.  It was fucked up, though, because at one point, this fucking old guy, who was cool at first,  he, for some reason, thought we were jumping his claim.  No.  And we were checking out this ghost town, and there was a jail in there.  Right.  And he, like, said, check out this cell.  And we all went in, and then he fucking shut the door and then stole our station wagon.  Whoa, that's crazy.  I know.  Fucking pissed.  Did he get lost in the Grand Canyon, too, a little bit?  No, no, my little sister did, and my brother. 
[00:45:00]  Did he call out to her?  Yeah, yeah, we were calling out for a while.  Did you finally come, or...?  Yeah, yeah.  They had lived off of some, I guess they were baked beans in a flashlight or something.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  They met some Indian kid.  It worked out in the end, obviously.  It all works out in the end.  Terrific.  Everything's fine now.  Mm-hmm.  Except Dad had AIDS, and he died.  Jesus.  Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  Can we get Nick Willenda on our show?  No way.  He was in here.  What? 
[00:45:30]  Like a week or two ago.  What?  Did he go on the morning mashup?  What did he do?  I don't know.  He did a bunch of shows.  Who?  Nick Willenda.  When?  A week or two ago.  Why did we talk to him?  Tightrope Channel?  I didn't even know he was here.  You went on the Tightrope Channel?  Tightrope Channel?  Are you an Indian to our fucking channel?  Grand Canyon Channel?  He would have done the show.  I mean, he wasn't being picky.  What other shows are on the Tightrope Channel?  I don't know if their channel exists.  Did he do the Catholic Channel?  He did like...  Oh, I bet he did.  The Tracking Channel.  He did a ton of them.  Praise the Lord.  Praise Jesus.  Did he do the...  Can we put a...  Can we get some like duct tape and make a line all the way down this hall? 
[00:46:00]  Thank you, Jesus.  Praise Jesus for our interns.  Yes.  Praise Jesus.  Yes.  Praise Jesus for the way that thing moves.  Thank you, Lord.  Let's put a line of duct tape all the way down the long hallway and see who could fucking  make it to the end.  Without, what, falling off the line?  We should film it for WorstBitsEver.com. 
[00:46:30]  That was a big fat wire.  Oh, come on.  It was two inches.  It was like the size of his foot pretty much.  Yeah, exactly.  And the bottom of his shoes are really soft.  You can see he takes his like big toe and then the next one over and goes over the wire.  Yeah.  And the shoe kind of bends.  They're special shoes Mama makes.  I would think they'd have to be a special shoe.  Mama makes the shoes.  Mom makes them.  He should have to wear tap shoes.  How slippery that would be.  Yes.  With metal taps.  Yes. 
[00:47:00]  He's just shuffling off the buffalo on the...  Yeah.  Do a little scat man in the middle.  Give him Gene Simmons boots.  Yeah, do it.  Yeah, kiss boots.  You fucking suck shoe for us over there, you fucking...  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, that was some terrific TV last night.  I definitely enjoyed it.  That was easy.  I enjoyed it.  Come on, Chip.  Fuck, yeah.  Chip, stop.  It wasn't easy.  But Twitter sucks because you just watched the Twitter feed to see if he fell or not.  That's true.  I guess I should have just shut that part up. 
[00:47:30]  Somebody would have said that was there.  In a second.  It would have been instant.  Oh, my God, he just fell.  Right.  Before it happened on TV.  Yeah.  And you think they would have shown it?  No.  Absolutely not.  They would not have shown it.  They would have went to a helicopter shot or something?  They had a fucking contingency plan and a guy on a button that was like his fucking one job is to punch out of that show.  Sound and audio, sound and video, done.  You think, right?  Absolutely.  Guarantee it.  There'd be lawsuits up the ass. 
[00:48:00]  But why?  People were traumatized, things like that.  I bet they'd show him stumble off the wire and then immediately cut it.  Then you'd have to go online.  I don't think they would show him stumbling.  I think that's right.  It would just be a quick cut to whatever, something.  And just say, oh, just so you know, he fell off the wire.  I don't know if they would even say anything.  They would probably just go to another show and make believe they never put it on.  Just straight to scared and naked or whatever that show is called.  Yes, yes. 
[00:48:30]  Bears in Alaska or something.  I don't know, they would just fucking make believe.  Yeah.  They would make believe they never had anything to do with it.  What happened to Nick Willenda?  I don't know.  He wasn't on our channel.  What do you mean, Nick Willenda?  Who?  Yeah, it wasn't on our channel.  What are you talking about?  Oh, he finished it.  He's fine.  Yeah, yeah, it's fine.  We didn't.  What's the naked show about?  It's like Survivor, but they're naked.  Everyone has to be naked, though?  It's the dumbest show.  I was watching it.  Really?  The reviews on the show were good.  It's stupid.  There's a guy.  Right.  He was like 40, I think. 
[00:49:00]  in his 40s, and there's some chick, and she was like 22, and then they put him out in  the middle of the jungle.  It's naked and afraid, and they take all their shit, their clothes, their fucking supplies,  and they got to kind of make do for a couple of weeks, a couple of three weeks, I guess.  But they have everything blurred out.  Right.  So you didn't see any tick.  You didn't see any what I assumed to be a giant hairy pussy on her. 
[00:49:30]  She got really wide hips there.  And then this guy was a psychopath.  Really?  And then they just mostly sat around complaining naked.  If they finally figured out a way to start selling DVDs again, because you're just going  to want to get the uncensored DVD.  Right, right.  You want the naked version, maybe.  So, yeah, it just looks like Survivor.  Yeah.  Naked.  And then you got the camera crew that always fucking takes you out of it. 
[00:50:00]  Because, you know, if anything really bad happens, there's people there to help them  out.  I hate that.  That's why I like Survivor, man, because he was filming his own shit.  Yeah.  That shitty camcorder.  Set the camera up.  Yeah, but this camera crew's naked.  Oh, everyone's naked?  I don't know if the camera crew's naked.  But this is the show that the producer of the show got bit by that snake, and his foot  was rotting away, and they showed it.  Oh, really?  That was that guy?  They showed it online?  Yeah, yeah.  That was him.  Oh, look how cute.  Little monkeys. 
[00:50:30]  I would never go into the jungle naked.  No.  I wouldn't come in here naked.  Why would you go in the jungle naked?  Yeah.  He got to kill a snake, poisonous snake.  Wow.  He beat his head in with a stick.  Imagine fucking fire ants crawling in your anus.  Oh, God.  In a pee hole.  Ow.  That could definitely happen if you were naked in a jungle.  Is he barefoot?  Yeah.  Yes, Jesus.  What's the point of this guy doing this?  Exactly.  It's difficult.  They fashioned some crude clothing out of leaves and vines and whatnot. 
[00:51:00]  There's people who live like this all the time.  Who gives this shit?  Yeah.  And then he gets overly dramatic after he killed the snake.  He looked up.  He's breathing heavy.  This guy was such a tool.  Why did he kill the snake?  Just to protect himself?  To eat it.  And so, you know, it wouldn't go around, you know, biting him.  To make cool TV.  And then they...  There's probably other snakes.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet there's other snakes in fucking Costa Rica.  And then they went back and then they also...  The chick got a tortoise.  She got a little turtle.  So they cracked that thing open and ate it. 
[00:51:30]  And then the next three days, she had like explosive diarrhea.  Oh, my God.  Food poisoning from a turtle?  And to keep warm at night, they were spooning naked.  Nice.  So imagine how shitty his dick got.  Nice.  She's squirting fucking diarrhea.  You think they, you know, did a little of that fucking...  I don't know.  Well, not much indication.  The guy was very...  He was naked in a jungle with a broad.  I think...  I think he just...  He's got to do some fucking...  It has to happen. 
[00:52:00]  He was a bit misogynistic.  He had a problem with girls and women and whatnot.  Yeah.  He was calling her kiddo for a while and it was really kind of...  Really?  ...twisted.  There was some paternal thing going on, but they're naked.  Right.  Were they wearing any clothes?  No.  Naked?  They're naked.  Oh.  It's in the title of the show, by the way.  Afraid.  Naked.  And naked.  Nice.  The naked part made no sense at all.  I was questioning.  It's like, why...  Like, who...  Why...  That's purely for shock. 
[00:52:30]  Of course.  Can't they have, like, you know, bikini and swim trunks?  Right.  We're taking everything, but here's your swim trunks.  Yeah, yeah.  Living in the scary jungle.  Right.  Naked.  But also naked.  Naked.  Their penis just rubs up against so many things in the jungle.  Just bumping into shit.  Yeah, at one point he's going down a steep embankment that was pretty muddy.  He's carrying wood.  And he slipped.  Right.  And he's just falling down.  And all I'm thinking is, what...  It's going up his ass and his dick and balls are hitting the ground. 
[00:53:00]  Just bouncing off everything.  Oh, yeah.  You're getting those parasites in there, probably.  Going to be with him for the rest of his life.  Dick worms or something.  Costa Rican...  The Costa Rican penis worm crawls in there.  Lays its eggs.  I'd be worried about getting a tick on my penis.  A little bit of everything else that's in the jungle.  Why would your penis start fucking making a weird movement?  Sick.  Oh, boy.  Like the whole of your dishes keeps going. 
[00:53:30]  Wah.  Wah.  Hello.  Why don't we take a break?  We've got a busy show today.  We've got Bob Kelly coming in today.  Oh, nice.  I believe he's got a TV show right around the corner.  Oh, right.  On Travel Channel or something?  Yes, it's called Naked and Afraid.  Oh, Bob's going to be on Naked and Afraid.  Only the viewers are afraid.  And then Melanie Monroe, she's been tweeting that we can't handle her and she's coming in today.  So watch out, guys.  Watch out.  She comes highly recommended. 
[00:54:00]  By the Who Kid.  By DJ Who Kid.  Why highly recommended?  He loves her.  She's on his show all the time, all naked.  Who is Melanie Monroe?  Afraid?  She's a big-titted penthouse.  Oh, good.  We have a penthouse broad coming out.  She's over there in the Shade Studios.  Then she's Naked and Afraid, I bet, too.  Yeah.  Goes on over there.  Queen of the MILFs.  Well, she's been tweeting that we can't handle her.  So let's, you know, let's take a deep breath here.  And I believe the idea...  Get prepared.  Everyone relax.  The idea of her is that we want to audition to see if she has the potential to be one of the bitches 
[00:54:30]  to come on the bus trip.  Oh, I thought to be on Naked and Afraid.  Naked, Afraid.  Let's do our own version of Naked and Afraid today.  We are.  It's on the bus trip.  Let's get her naked and let's see who can make her very afraid.  All right.  Like, E-Rock will hide under the desk and be like, boom!  Right.  There you go.  We can try that.  That's good.  Naked and Afraid.  Afraid.  E-Rock, you were tweeting like crazy about the Nick Wallenda.  What were your thoughts?  Oh, I was panicking, too, because I have a thing with heights just like Sam does. 
[00:55:00]  But I was wondering if, like, if he fell off, would they have to, like, cut off the mic if he's cursing Jesus?  It's a whole way down.  That's a long way down.  Yeah.  And you would hear some stuff.  Oh, you'd hear some shit.  I was wondering if they'd dub in, like, Goofy falling over the cliff.  Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm coming to you, Jesus!  Uh-huh.  Jesus, I'm coming!  Oh, yeah, you'd think.  My Lord, take me home!  I don't think he would understand Jesus at that point.  I don't think he would be thanking Jesus. 
[00:55:30]  Like, thank you, Jesus.  I know it's my time to go, Jesus.  Thank you.  The shot would be on Willie Geist, but they wouldn't have figured out the audio.  So Willie Geist is just staring awkwardly at the camera.  No, he would be saying something like, I'm coming home to you, Jesus!  They're going to ruin Willie Geist.  It's too bad.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a rock star right now, but they're going to get to him.  They're going to get to his brain.  Get to his brain?  I hope not.  Because he would be the type of guy that would just go, that is awesome.  He'd just plummet into his dad. 
[00:56:00]  That is awesome.  You see, at one point, they didn't know what to do with the camera, so the camera shot is  just on Willie Geist's crotch.  What?  It just cuts to a scene, and the camera's just on his crotch while they're talking.  I'm like, what the hell are they doing?  Then they cut back to the scenery.  Willie Geist had very tight pants on.  I don't know what that was about.  He did.  He decided, I need to fucking put some tight pants on.  Looked like he had a segment of that wire in his pants, right?  Amazing.  That is a thick wire.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Very.  All right, Jesus.  Thank you, Jesus.  We come back.  Just to the first break, Jesus.  Yes.  King of Kings.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you.  Can we talk about fucking Canada and their fucking sickening Supreme Court decision?  Oh.  Why?  We're keeping it fun right now.  Let's do it.  Let's talk about Canada.  Just the fucking lack of free speech.  I hate the Canadians.  No, I'm kidding.  Of course, Canada.  I love Canadians, but they're worse up there than we are here. 
[00:57:00]  Well, that's obvious.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  That comic has to pay money to that fucking lesbian couple.  Oh, that story's still going on.  All right, yeah.  We're getting up there on that.  The Supreme Court upheld.  That's crazy.  Really?  That's embarrassing.  You should be in Canada.  You should be fucking embarrassed.  Well, we'll talk about that next.  And, of course, Paula Deen.  Paula Deen.  And her apologies.  How many did she make?  How many is she up to?  Like 10 or 12 now?  Yeah, I think so.  15.  Oh, my God. 
[00:57:30]  And what?  She put one online and doesn't understand?  Embarrassing.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll get into that.  Oh, yeah.  It's fantastic.  All right.  My name's so shitty.  My name's so shitty from your asshole.  My name's so shitty.  My name's so shitty from your asshole.  Oh, yeah.  Say you won't blow me like it in your face. 
[00:58:00]  Say you won't take the cock in your dirty place.  Now, I'm all filthy.  There's jewelry on my dick.  It looks just like a black pants. 
[00:58:30]  But not quite as thick.  Your coolie needs a diaper.  Cause I'm in your cold and blue.  Down in dirty hand.  And my dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  My dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  Dick's so shitty. 
[00:59:00]  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  Oh.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony Show  On SiriusXM  Hold on, hold on, hold on  I just want to say one thing, y'all  I want to say one thing  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel 
[00:59:30]  Opie and Anthony Channel  Opie and Anthony Channel  On SiriusXM  We should do a montage of the first things we say  When these mics go on  We should do a montage of the first things  When these mics go on  We should do a montage  Because even after all these years  It's just dumb little noises  Ha ha noises  Ha ha noises

I got to go before he gets mad.  I thought I was going to get that, too.  God damn it.  I can't get no puss here.  Chip, chip, person on the scene.  Chip, chip, person on the scene.  Yeah.  Fucking home run, chip, person.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[01:03:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you, Jesus, for my oatmeal.  I wonder what's hanging on.  King of Kings, thank you.  Thank you, Jesus.  Oh, and these wonderful blueberries, too, Jesus.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't know.  What is this?  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[01:04:00]  What's that?  50 years?  45 years?  I'm not even going to say what it is.  I don't know.  I'm just throwing out, like, how many years?  Is this 45 years?  72 years ago, the Beach Boys released their greatest hits album, Endless Summer.  72?  Endless Summer, yeah.  What?  I don't think it was that one.  Yeah, right there.  Look, 72 years ago.  Damn.  Who did that spell?  Al from Happy Days is still alive?  That's too bad.  Get the fuck out of here.  How old's Al?  94?  No way. 
[01:04:30]  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  Really?  Wow.  Is he still alive, really?  What was his name?  Al Molinero.  Oh, Jesus.  How old's Fonzie?  Uh, Fonzie's, uh, 82.  82.  The Fonz.  He is, though.  No.  Yeah.  Come on, Mel.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.  All right.  See, anyone could do that. 
[01:05:30]  I could have been a Beach Boy, Sam.  You could not.  I did good there.  You didn't.  That's a great song.  Huh?  That's a great song.  Yeah.  You like that one?  You like that Beach Boy stuff?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Look, I, I, um, I know Paula Deen should be able to say nigger.  Uh-huh.  But I was just thinking how much fun Patrice would have with the, uh.  Oh, my God.  The old white-haired fucking woman saying, saying the word.  Yeah.  Racist old white lady.  Oh, yeah.  He would be.  He, um.  I hate when this shit comes up, because I just picture Patrice immediately. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  He would be laughing so fucking hard at Paula Deen and how ridiculous she looks.  I mean.  You know, she would say it.  Everybody would say it.  She's a racist old white lady.  He'd be, he'd be like, let's be, you know.  He would be laughing at how she's groveling for forgiveness from black people.  That apology.  No one's going to listen to your apologies.  It's please, please, black people.  Please.  My life was great.  Let me work, black people.  Please, Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Please, Jesus.  Jesus. 
[01:06:30]  Under the authority of black people, Jesus, please.  King of kings, please, Jesus.  Hallelujah.  You understand.  Sometimes you just have to say that word, right, Jesus?  All she had to do is say, no, never use that word.  Never said it.  I don't believe there's a person alive that has not said that word.  Exactly.  I really don't.  Yeah, that's why.  I mean, when Sean Hannity once said on our phone, he never said the word or never thought  the word.  I was like, all right.  I threw my hands up that day and then went, all right. 
[01:07:00]  I understand why you have to say that, Sean Hannity, but that's ridiculous.  Yeah, I don't believe it.  Sean's smart.  You're not rewarded for honesty in this country.  No.  You're rewarded for lying.  Right.  We are rewarded for being a liar.  So Sean is smart and Paula Deen is dumb.  Yeah, you can't say that shit.  But for people to make believe that people don't use the word, that's just crazy.  That's just crazy talk.  Of course they use it.  I think every person has used the word in some context.  Right? 
[01:07:30]  Even if you're just describing somebody else use it, you say what they said.  Or you're listening to Biggie Smalls and you're singing along.  Exactly.  Or you can't hear the movie.  Or you're cooking with Brazil nuts.  But here's Paula Deen.  It's her turn.  It's her turn in the old racist slash you can't say shit barrel.  The apology.  I like her red-faced apology the best.  You do?  Yeah, but then she decided that wasn't good enough. 
[01:08:00]  So she decided, oh, we got to get that off YouTube before everyone sees it.  And I'm going to make another one.  And she has no idea how this shit works.  That it's there forever.  Forever and ever.  Like she thought that she could just get rid of that video and no one would fucking see it.  You can delete that, right?  Right.  Well, I deleted it.  How is it out there?  Now, how do they have copies of it?  Right, Jesus, those people.  I'll be honest, I got lazy with this story.  I don't even really know what this is about.  She was being sued. 
[01:08:30]  For sexual harassment?  It was like harassment, workplace harassment.  They said she was saying nigger and she talked about some party she wanted to have.  Right.  Some plantation party.  Plantation party.  So what was the problem with that?  Well, it would have been like everybody would have been dressed like Plantation Day, like Django, you know?  Sure.  But she also wanted the black people in servant uniforms.  Would not be renewing her contract, but now her supporters are dishing out plenty of criticism of that decision.  While others are applauding the Food Network. 
[01:09:00]  I want to apologize to everybody.  All of these fans are standing by the butter-loving chef and threatening to boycott the Food Network for sticking a fork in her shows.  I'm going to wrap it in bacon and we're going to deep fry it.  At her Savannah restaurant, the line was around the block this weekend as patrons showed support.  She has apologized.  I thought maybe we ought to take that for what it's worth.  I think it's a learning lesson for her and it's a learning lesson for the people that do forgive.  So I would forgive her. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, good.  Holy shit.  We just saw something happen on TV.  We've never seen that before.  They have nothing to forgive her for.  She wasn't talking to them.  What are their business?  Filed by a former employee.  Please forgive me.  What?  The mistakes that I've made.  And it's so great because they're showing the apologies online after readily admitting to using the N-word in the past.  The N-word.  Your color of your skin, your religion, your sexual preference.  Your penis size.  To me. 
[01:10:00]  Your inability to adhere to the law.  I am so sorry.  Dean is also accused in the lawsuit of wanting to plan a southern plantation-themed party with black waiters.  Just last year, Dean spoke at a New York Times event about race relations in the South and her views on slavery.  Black folks played such an integral part in our lives.  They were like our family.  And we didn't see ourselves as being prejudiced.  I think we're all prejudiced against one something or another. 
[01:10:30]  And I think black people feel the same prejudice, you know, that white people feel.  Shortly after her public apology, the Food Network said it was not renewing her contract, putting an end to her three shows.  The scandal has whipped up more than 13,000 comments on the Food Network's Facebook page.  Food Network, I'm firing you.  Goodbye, row one user.  Others applaud the Food Network's decision to dump Dean.  I love seeing this. 
[01:11:00]  Great move, Food Network.  It had to be done.  Disrespectful slurs will not be tolerated.  People fighting back for once.  This all-out could continue.  Listen to what QVC, which carries Dean's line of cookware, told CNN.  We're watching those developments closely and reviewing our business relationship with Miss Dean.  Fired.  I think they fired her already, right?  Which sells Dean's products, has not yet commented on the future of their relationship.  Her cookware is also sold at other chains, including Target and Kmart.  The case she is involved in is still ongoing. 
[01:11:30]  And Dean has released his statement thanking the Food Network for 11 great years.  So her life is ruined because she admitted that she has said nigger in her life at some point.  Well, known as the Reputation Doctor, better name, better title than anyone I've ever had.  And has been in more than 20 years' experience in strategic public relations.  So beyond the legal trouble that she is facing, let's talk about her reputation.  Damn, that's a big bitch.  In the role that she has, in the brand that she has, it is all about reputation. 
[01:12:00]  Do you think she's done?  Holy shit, she's huge.  Or do you think this is a blip and there is a chance that she could actually come back to have a career?  Well, there's a court of law and there's a court of public opinion.  One of the things you need to be thinking about when you look at this story is that approximately 50%,  I would even lean more towards it being more important than 50% the court of public opinion.  So the attorneys are obviously behind the scenes, but there needs to be someone like myself,  a crisis PR expert or reputation management expert, helping her.  By the way, where's all the progressive free thinkers in this country sticking up for her? 
[01:12:30]  They're kind of sticking up for her.  But I mean, her fans are.  Right, right.  But where are people who politically or ideologically find what she said revolting?  Where are they?  They're too scared for their livelihoods.  No, they're happy that she's in trouble.  Right.  Where's the celebrities?  There's not, even though she is a cunt.  Right.  There's not one celebrity.  I know.  Sticking up for her right to be a cunt.  Yeah.  We're almost celebrities.  Well.  And we're sticking up for her.  Sure.  But we're shock jocks.  All right.  Right out.  Oops.  It's completely ridiculous.  Yep.  They just leave her hanging.  But I like that her fans are, you know, fucking coming out of the woodwork and, you know, 
[01:13:00]  doing whatever they can.  Because you rarely see that.  Right?  Yeah.  No one ever fights back.  No one ever fights back.  Yeah.  It also doesn't help that everybody hated her before anyway.  Yeah.  Why is she so hateable?  She's not a likable.  Because she gives people diabetes.  Like, she just makes.  She really does make horrible things.  Mac and cheese wrapped in bacon and then deep fried.  Oh, boy.  That's hard to figure out.  Why is she a great chef for coming up with that? 
[01:13:30]  She's not.  She's just this sort of.  She makes tasty ass food, I bet, though.  Yeah, but that shit we were doing at the Fig House, a stupid fraternity house, we would  fuck around like that.  Whoa.  I don't have a cooking show.  You also have marshmallows in your ass.  Well, true.  You know.  Awkward.  To be real.  Well, we didn't eat dessert.  Oh, imagine those.  I'm sure.  I'm sure someone had to eat one.  She's just like that, you know, southern grandma who everybody finds comfortable, except 
[01:14:00]  then you find out she's doing terrible things.  Right.  And she admitted she used the word because, what, she was being held up or something or  saw her, like, a robbery go down or what the fuck?  I don't exactly know why she said she used the word, but the fact that she also, I think  it weighs in heavily that she wanted to throw a party with black people dressed up.  Now, here it is.  It's not just the black people dressed up.  In house slaves.  She wanted to have, like, a plantation party, a southern plantation party of the era, of,  you know, the mid-1800s. 
[01:14:30]  Part of that is having a black waitstaff.  She's not, I'm sure she's not going to be, like, let's whip them and put them in the  box or something like that.  But just to have that whole thing, it's portrayed in movies.  But the complaint would be celebrating.  Like, oh, look, it's an authentic, what about when you're having the Civil War reenactments  and stuff?  You know, things like that.  It's a historical-themed party.  Why wouldn't you want authentic, you couldn't have a Nazi party? 
[01:15:00]  It's not the smartest idea.  He does it every weekend.  A Nazi party probably meant you shouldn't.  It certainly isn't the smartest idea to have a plantation party.  No, no.  Hey, look, I'm not saying it's a smart idea.  I mean, she's not the smartest fucking person.  I'm not saying it's not tacky.  It's not in a horrid taste.  I'm just saying to put on it the same weight you would as her, like, making jokes about 
[01:15:30]  slavery or things, like what some people are saying, that it's so horrible.  No.  You know, you've got to keep it in perspective.  Yeah, I don't think it's that bad.  And the fact that she wanted to have that kind of party, who gives a fuck?  I can see why people would stop watching her, because they don't like that.  But the Food Network, you can't fire somebody.  She's an old cunt.  Like, fuck.  I'm not saying she's not a cunt or just an old bag.  Exactly.  Like, to want to do that, you're kind of an old cunt.  But it shouldn't cost you your job.  No.  Of course not.  It comes off as an entitled old white woman that, like, is downplaying the struggle of 
[01:16:00]  blacks in the history.  So all that, yeah, sure.  But to lose your job over something like that is ridiculous.  Well, the dishonesty in the whole thing is what's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Right.  I mean, I guarantee the guy who had to make the decision to get her off the Food Network  used the word.  I mean, who are you kidding?  Unless everybody...  And enough with the media saying the N-word.  I know.  It sounds ridiculous.  You're saying the word.  They're saying nigger.  So if you're not going to say it, let it be uncomfortable. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  And say the word.  Yeah.  And you're saying it more than when they used to not say the N-word.  They love that there's a word now that means the word.  Because now they can say it all the time.  Right.  I don't know how they used to get away with it.  What's the difference between the two?  You're saying the word when you say the N-word.  How did they used to report on the news?  Well...  They said nigger.  He said...  You know...  Did we see that Tonight Show clip recently?  Did I watch it here or was it at home?  Oh, it was the Pryor documentary. 
[01:17:00]  How about the niggas?  No, it was Johnny Carson.  Yeah.  Yes.  And he was talking to Richard Pryor.  And he said, you say nigger a lot.  Does that...  And they were very close.  And he was no...  Did the audience go...  No.  No, it was really weird, though, to watch.  Yeah.  They applaud.  Because the audience knew back then...  It was strange, though, being from the future like we are.  The future.  We're from the future.  And then you get to...  You see that.  You went, oh, that is weird.  Because you will not have Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, or Jay Leno. 
[01:17:30]  They would never say that.  Never.  I used to be able to use that word on the radio when I was in high school.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Can you find that?  Can you look up Carson Pryor?  Crazy.  Because he was asking him about a legit question.  Of course.  Because people had given Pryor a little bit of shit about it.  There's no context anymore.  It's a great clip.  With the nigger, there's no context in saying it.  It's always portrayed as horribly bad.  Whether you're asking a question like that or using it in an offensive manner, it's the same now.  Wait, this lady wants to school us on Paula Deen. 
[01:18:00]  Jennifer in Pennsylvania, go ahead.  What are we getting wrong?  Oh, you're getting nothing wrong.  I just wanted to let you know that Paula Deen is the one who brought the Neelys, who I believe are black, to the Food Network.  And she's also had gay people, black people, all kinds of people on her show.  Oh, then I'm glad she's being fired.  Very, very bad woman.  All right.  Well, you just turned to us.  Good for her.  Good riddance.  So there you go.  I just wanted to let you know.  Well, I think, obviously, we don't have her fans listening to us for the most part. 
[01:18:30]  All that goes down to shitter.  I sure hope the fans continue to support her, because it's enough already with this bullshit.  Yeah.  It's all bullshit.  If you like a show and the host gets in trouble, you've got to support them.  You've got to start fighting back against these corporate douchebags.  Yep.  Well, I'm sure no woman in the Deep South has ever used that word before.  Oh, I'm sure they have, miss.  We all have.  We've all used the word. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, and I love you, Chip.  What's that?  Oh, God.  Go fuck yourself.  I'll put my Pekka ring in so deep.  I'll give you a good Pekka rogering.  Okay, I'll send you my email.  Yeah, please do.  You can send it to me, and I'll send you pictures of my Pekka.  I would appreciate that.  It's so fucking big, it's not even funny.  It isn't.  All right, thanks, guys.  Yeah, all right.  I think my Pekka is deep.  Makes you cum buckets.  Can we listen to the Paula Deen apology? 
[01:19:30]  Which one?  I think my mutter.  Oh, you found the Johnny Carson clip, too?  No, I did not find it.  Okay.  That's not online, but you want the first one or the second one?  Oh, the first one when she's a red-faced idiot.  Yeah.  A red-faced idiot.  Hi, I'm Paula Deen.  I'm on the sun.  Why is her face so red?  Because then in the other one, I want to apologize to everybody for the wrong that I've done.  Especially the naggers.  I want to learn and grow from this inappropriate, hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. 
[01:20:00]  I've made plenty of mistakes along the way.  But I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness.  Please forgive me for the mistakes that I've made. 
[01:20:30]  That's it?  Mistakes?  Yeah.  I feel like you can edit that, right?  I'm not fucking just groveling.  It makes me sick to my stomach.  But you can't blame her in a weird way, you know?  She's, yeah.  She's seen her whole empire go away for something, some just nonsense.  It's just nonsense in the end.  So, now she's not a red-faced idiot in this one.  No.  And then she released this, what, an hour later or something?  A couple hours later? 
[01:21:00]  I'm still really sorry.  Please, I beg you black people.  Is this the one where she apologized to Matt Lauer?  Yes.  For what?  Because she was supposed to go on Matt Lauer and then she chickened out.  She was not physically able.  No, this is where she should have went on Matt Lauer and just taken the heat.  Her fucking pukey rep probably told her.  Fucking vomity publicist.  Exactly.  You don't want to do that.  Hello, y'all.  I'm Paula Deen.  I was invited this morning to speak with Matt Lauer about a subject that has been very hurtful. 
[01:21:30]  And the Negro weatherman.  The pain has been tremendous that I have caused to myself and to others.  To myself.  The pain I caused to myself.  So, I'm taking this opportunity now that I've pulled myself together and am able to speak  to offer an apology to those that I have hurt.  Keep in mind, she was obviously able to speak before this because she had already released 
[01:22:00]  and believed in the other apology.  The one where she was a red-faced.  The one I label.  Red-faced idiot.  Red-faced idiot.  I want people to understand that my family and I are not the kind of people that the press  ever sounds good.  This is wanting to say we are.  I've spent the best of 24 years to help myself and others. 
[01:22:30]  Your color of your skin, your religion, your sexual preference does not matter to me.  But it's what in the heart.  To God it does.  Yeah.  And my family and I try to live by that.  And I am here to say I am so sorry.  I was wrong.  Yes, I've worked hard and I've made mistakes.  But that is no excuse. 
[01:23:00]  No excuse.  And I offer my sincere apology to those that I have hurt and I hope that you forgive me  because this comes from the deepest part of my heart.  And I will continue to work and continue to do good things for good people.  Okay.  For white people.  Thank you for listening. 
[01:23:30]  That's the groveling begging right before you get shot on the fucking, like, firing squad  or, you know, some fucking warlord's got a machete and hacks your head off.  Another fake outrage by the Americans.  Another fake, another fake fucking American.  You know, I've been obsessed with it as we all have.  This inspires this dumb country into a racial chat.  Yes.  Michael Richards inspires this dumb country into a racial chat.  But the four black Marines who fucking rape the black wife and murder the white husband 
[01:24:00]  of their, you know, the Marine commander.  And then they write nigger on the wall so it looks like the Klan did it.  Uh-huh.  And the media says that their motives were robbery.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or that the one guy didn't get a promotion.  That doesn't spark any racial chat.  None.  This does.  Mm-hmm.  And none of this, by the way, is the fault of blacks.  This is all white people's fucking phoniness.  Well, I'll add a little fault of the black people. 
[01:24:30]  No, none.  All of it.  Wow.  Because black people will talk about it.  If you talk about those Marines, black people will talk about it.  They won't shy away.  They know what happens.  You talk to a couple of black guys about that, they understand what that was.  Mm-hmm.  And they understand.  If you ask black people, do you think that the media would report it differently if it  was what?  They would probably tell you, yeah, if it was four white Marines, a black male and a  white woman, of course they would report it.  This is what makes us talk.  It is ridiculous.  Shit.  This fucking old battle axe. 
[01:25:00]  Who cares about her?  Who cares about her?  She's not relevant.  She's a fucking fat old lady.  Give the fuck.  You know, saying that, just let her do a dumb show.  Who cares?  Why would you fire someone for that?  Yeah, the Food Network is disgusting.  And the Food Network's statement, you know, trying to distance themselves from it.  We, oh boy, we don't.  Harumph, harumph.  But we sure don't have the feelings that this woman, please, in no way do we agree with  the fucking blah, blah, blah.  That's so stupid.  I bet you there's a lot of joking in the boardroom at the Food Network. 
[01:25:30]  I bet.  Those old white guys trying to tell me they've never used a word.  Are you kidding me?  I was saying, I tweeted, they should have the glasses like on, and they live.  Only you see everybody that's used the word nigger before.  Oh my God.  It would be like everybody.  I can't imagine there's not a person.  It's so dishonest to think that people, if their emotions or their anger is really up  there, they're personally affected by something, whether it's somebody cutting you off on the 
[01:26:00]  street or killing your family or anything in between, that you wouldn't want to use the  most harsh language as possible against that person, no matter what they are, no matter  what race or anything.  You go for the jugular when you're angry.  No one's going to convince me that in the case of black people, you tame it back one notch.  You tame your anger back one notch because you're such a good person and would never think  or speak like that.  You're fucking being so dishonest. 
[01:26:30]  Because when someone fucks you and fucks with you, your family, whatever, you go for  the jugular every time.  Fucking asshole, fuck you, you motherfucker.  And you're going to at least think it, if not say it.  Stop.  So, we'll see what happens with Paula Deen.  But so far, you know, the fans are stepping forward with it.  It's crazy that they don't even wait to see if people will still watch it or not.  If everybody stops watching it, then okay. 
[01:27:00]  That was the discussion we had last week, because this happens all the fucking time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You wait and see what happens, and then if the ratings drastically drop because she did  that, and then you get rid of her.  But they never wait it out.  Mm-mm.  What would be the problem with waiting it out?  Especially because it didn't happen while she was doing this show.  It has nothing to do with what she does for a living.  And most of the people that are upset, like, they don't even know. 
[01:27:30]  People aren't reading the story.  They just heard Paula Deen is dropping M-bombs.  So, yeah, I hate her.  Well, that's just it.  People hear what they hear on the news, and that's it.  Oh, the news.  They make that decision based on that.  That's why there's so many misconceptions about the Zimmerman trial.  And people are like, oh, yeah, he did this, that, oh, he's going to be charged.  Because no one knows what the real facts of the case are.  They heard the news report shit a week after it happened, think they knew everything, and 
[01:28:00]  you still hear people quoting things that have been proven absolutely false.  That, by the way, starts up today, I guess, opening arguments today in the Zimmerman trial.  They have the jury.  It's six, all women, five white broads, one Hispanic mixed woman.  They will be sequestered.  Wow.  And they are from, you know, various backgrounds.  But, uh...  You think the women thing is bad news for them? 
[01:28:30]  No, I don't think so.  I think it's all right.  I think, uh, if you read about their backgrounds, it's not just, you know, some fucking college  chick or something.  It's, you know, women that have worked, their mothers, the people saying it's the mother  thing you think can affect it.  But, I don't know, white moms are a little different.  Why no black women?  I guess, uh, I guess they were like, we don't want any black women on here.  Why wouldn't the prosecutor?  I guess they wanted it, but, you know.  I think the lawyers should be fired for racism. 
[01:29:00]  Racism.  The women will, um, the, uh, uh, black women are very emotional in this case, from what I've  seen and read, my own, my own experience with black women, women in this case.  They're very emotional.  They, uh, they kind of bypassed some of the facts for pure emotion.  Uh, we'll see what happens, though.  They're, they're starting that up today.  I'll keep a close eye on it. 
[01:29:30]  Close eye on this case.  I was wondering.  Like I did Casey Anthony.  Like I did Casey Anthony.  If you recall, I was, uh, you know, inundated with people saying, oh, you're crazy, she's  going to prison, I'm like, look, what I see in the evidence, and lack thereof, actually,  on the part of the prosecution, she's going to walk on this one.  You were right.  And she walked, and I'm saying the same thing about the Zimmerman trial from what I've seen  so far.  But, but you only watched that case because she was really hot, and you were hoping that  she would come to the compound for a pool party.  Exactly. 
[01:30:00]  Why else would I?  Are you going to do surgery on yourself or something?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm, uh, I got some, uh, little cuticle scissors.  Right.  Right here, and a mirror.  But I think I got to go into the bathroom and use that mirror, the big mirror.  Why?  I can't really do it here.  I can't get a good look.  What are you going to do?  Well, I got a stitch, one more stitch.  No.  You are a stitch.  In there.  From when I had the extraction done on my wisdom tooth.  Right.  And it's really intrusive.  It's, it's on the side of my tongue. 
[01:30:30]  I can't really talk very well.  It's, uh, and it's hurting, like, right where it's threaded through the gum.  I'll get it.  So, that's like, it's irritating it.  So, I'm going to snip the stitch.  Let's hold the mirror and let's do this.  I'm going to snip the stitch.  By the way, the stitch is not a tight stitch at this point.  It's a loop of, of, uh, material that is hanging down and, and it's interrupting with  my speech.  All right.  So, it's not holding anything right now.  So, I'm going to snip it and then pull it through.  What are you, a Lenda? 
[01:31:00]  It's very risky.  You want me to hold the mirror for you?  No, I, I think I got to go to a.  No, you got to do it on the air.  I want to.  All right.  Let's get a bigger mirror.  Let me see.  Get a bigger mirror.  Get a bigger mirror.  What if we get, oh wait, I get a bigger mirror.  Wait, we're getting you a bigger mirror.  Yeah.  Wait, let me take a, um, I got to take a photo first.  Of what?  Inside.  So, I could scope it out.  Oh.  I got to scope it out.  We got a bigger mirror.  Yeah, we got a bigger mirror.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's see what we got.  I'll call it that.  Oh, okay.  Hey, look at that.  It's a Grand Theft Auto.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Anthony.  Well, someone's got to hold the mirror for it.  You're going to hold it out?  Oh, I got to hold it.  Jesus Christ.  I'll hold it.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  He's just snipping a fucking, what's wrong with you? 
[01:32:00]  He's going to cut his tongue.  No, he's not.  I wish he would.  You see that big worthless appendage fall out?  That fucking race-baiting appendage.  All the hatred on that thing.  Oh, my God.  It would probably shrivel up and die like a fucking rose in a vampire movie.  That fucking hateful piece of flesh.  Holy shit.  They never had a decent thing pass over it.  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.  The tongue that launched 10,000 racist diatribes has been killed.  All right.  Where are we at?  Is this just snipping?  Attaboy.  Snipping.  Oh, fuck.  Now you admit.  Want me to do it?  Did he do it?  Uh-uh. 
[01:33:00]  He's got scissors in his mouth.  It's all the way in the back, too.  Ah.  Ah.  You got it?  There it is.  That's pretty impressive.  There it is.  Ah.  A little surgery.  There it is.  Do you want to smell that?  No.  A little stitch.  Oh, that's much better.  Oh, thank God.  Oh, Murray, you're a stitch.  Praise Jesus.  Jesus, steady my hand, Jesus.  King of kings.  King of kings, Jesus.  Keep that hand fucking steady.  Oh, Jesus, DDS.  Yes. 
[01:33:30]  Thank you, Jesus.  Very good.  Hi, Jackie.  Yay!  She looks very cute today.  She's got a little striped dress on.  She's a wonderful girl.  She's a red belt.  She comes right in and brings the berries.  You know what they wear.  You know their names.  Why wouldn't I?  They're adorable.  This is atypical intern behavior.  It's called having respect, Sam.  Wait till the next batch of dumb guys.  They're human beings, goddammit.  It's called having erections.  Not having respect.  Yeah.  By the way, look at this.  What?  See, this to me is pretty good. 
[01:34:00]  Right?  Yeah.  And she's completely out of my demo.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She's nice, too.  You look every time, though.  Is she nice?  Yeah, she looks every time.  Yeah, she's very friendly.  All right, our oatmeal's here.  Praise Jesus.  Praise Jesus.  We're going to do some oatmeal.  We got Bob Kelly coming in.  I think he's got a travel channel show or something.  Does he?  Yeah, what is it about?  Does anyone know?  Yeah.  It's, uh, I think it's him and Sherrod. 
[01:34:30]  Right?  Yes.  It's men versus food is what it's called.  Oh, boy.  But it's not the same concept as men versus food.  They go to a town, and then they find, like, all these different food spots, and then they  just have to keep going and going until one person taps out.  They just eat and eat and eat at different food spots.  Why did he do this?  Yeah, Bob Kelly's trying to take care of himself, I thought.  Well, this is just...  How do you find an excuse to eat?  He needs everybody to...  You can't say no to TV.  He needs everybody to watch because this is the pilot. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  And they say, he said, if a lot of people watch, they'll pick it up for a full season.  Oh.  I don't know.  He's just going to do a lot of eating.  I feel this isn't healthy for Bobby.  It's not smart.  No, it's not healthy at all.  Yeah, let's make sure the pilot doesn't get picked up.  And it's not like they're going to juice bars.  Juice?  Well, they're allowed to drink there, too.  That's not appropriate.  Juice.  Juice.  Do they eat little juice sandwiches?  No, juice.  I said juice bars. 
[01:35:30]  I don't know, but the juice sandwich thing is starting to take off a little bit.  What's a juice sandwich?  You know it when you see it.  It's wrapped in tinfoil.  It's not impressive.  I don't know.  I've seen some juice make giant sandwiches.  A bit on the thin side.  Yeah?  Usually there's some kind of pickle with it that's also individually wrapped in tinfoil.  Pickle?  Mm-hmm.  I hate when they lay that fucking pickle on your sandwich and wrap the sandwich up, and  they open it up, and there's a green stripe of pickle juice on your fucking sandwich, and  now your sandwich tastes like pickle every bite? 
[01:36:00]  How about...  Fucking bullshit.  How about we start with, I hate when they give you a pickle that doesn't taste like a  fucking pickle.  Can we start there, at least?  That, too.  If you're going to give me a fucking pickle, could it taste like a pickle and not a goddamn  cucumber that you left down in the sun for a day?  Ugh!  What the fuck is that about?  Exactly.  I hate when you're trying to pull the pickle back out, and you can only get your fucking thumb and  point your finger and nail on it, and you break the tip off while it's still lodged in your  asshole.  Don't you hate that? 
[01:36:30]  Jimmy doesn't have human experiences.  Oh, I love it.  I gotta finally realize that.  Jimmy's human experiences are a bit different.  His observations are completely unrelated.  Yes, yes.  Right.  Oh, Jimmy.  What is it with the pickles that aren't pickles yet?  And why do they serve them?  Yeah, it's a cucumber.  Stop it.  It's dry.  Oh, the hell out of me.  Yes.  It's dry and fucking not pickle-y tasting. 
[01:37:00]  I'll eat pickles all day long.  They're called half-sours.  They're disgusting.  But people love them.  Half-sours.  I don't mind that.  Because sometimes a sour is too much.  A half-sour.  If you have a fissure, it burns.  Oh.  Check out the big belly on E-Rock.  Although you can't eat a lot of gherkins.  He knows lots about food.  I, uh...  Can't eat a lot of gherkins.  I like jerk in the gherkin.  Oh, nice.  Sure.  Okay.  Yes.  All right, then.  The gherkin.  How do you feel about your bread and butter pickle? 
[01:37:30]  Not bad.  Those are pretty good.  Not bad.  I like a good dill.  I do like a solid dill spear.  Old school.  Dill spear.  Now you're talking.  Yes.  Vlasic.  With a little hamburger on the side.  Hamburger, ketchup, a little cheese on that bed boy.  No, I don't like...  Maybe a little tomato and then that nice dill pickle.  To bring it all together.  Don't like a pickle with anything.  Pickle is very overbearing.  You don't like pickles with your hamburger?  I just like taking a pickle and eating it.  I don't want a pickle with anything else because they overpower everything. 
[01:38:00]  It's a very strong thing.  So it's like, oh great, I'm having a pickle burger.  I'm having pickle fries.  I'm having pickle ketchup.  It's pickle.  Pickle, pickle, pickle.  We're talking about pickles and not racial issues?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, I got a little confused.  I like having my pickles separate.  I got a little confused.  Separated.  Picklemania.com?  Yeah.  Picklemania.  Although you got the dill spear and you got the hamburger and you want to put the pickle on the hamburger  and you're all fucked up because it's all lumpy.  It doesn't work.  But you want the wonderful taste that the dill pickle brings to the hamburger. 
[01:38:30]  In every bite.  I'm very good.  I need a pickle in every bite too, yes.  With condiments too, I don't like the one thing sitting there on the edge of something  and you get one bite and that.  I need everything evenly distributed in every bite.  It's funny, that's the only place you feel that way.  Exactly.  I like diversity in my food.  That's it though.  Melanie Monroe is on her way.  She's going to be here in about an hour.  She's been tweeting.  Look out.  She's been tweeting.  We can't handle her. 
[01:39:00]  So she wants to make sure we're fully prepared for her appearance.  What was her quote?  I don't know.  We look out.  I don't know.  Here she comes.  Those days have passed us by.  The, whoa, watch out.  I'm sure she's going to be cool as hell.  Is she a MILF?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, all right.  She's fucking juicy, man.  All right.  Look at her ass.  All right.  I see what's going on there.  Give it a kiss.  Hi.  Would you?  She's got a bit of an hourglass figure going on. 
[01:39:30]  Hourglass.  Okay.  I see what's going on there.  Hmm.  What did she do on the Who Kids show?  She's on there all the time.  Okay.  I see.  All right.  She's bent over there.  Oh, God.  What is going on there?  She's a good girl.  That's what's going on there.  She's bending over in shade 45.  She was over there bending over for the boys.  Oh, yeah.  What is she doing there?  That a girl.  Is she wild?  Whoa, look out.  She's working out with princess weights.  Oh, look at the big ass on her. 
[01:40:00]  That's sticking out.  Sam, you like that?  Yeah.  That's juicy, man.  Oh, she's fucking fantastic.  Yeah, you digging her?  Oh, my God.  Look at the ass on that girl.  That's a man's ass.  Oh, dude, you're crazy.  I have to say no.  You're crazy.  That's a fat ass.  That's a big ass.  That's a man's ass or skinny.  It's a little muscular.  I don't like a muscular ass.  Oh, man.  A man's ass is a skinny. 
[01:40:30]  It's round.  That's a woman's juicy, plump ass.  It's a big.  Yeah, it is big.  It's a big ass.  But a guy's ass is flat.  Guys have awful asses.  Thank God.  What I'm saying, actually?  I'd hate to be turned on by a beautiful man ass.  She's all right.  She's all right.  What's she going to do for us today, Sam Roberts?  She said look out.  What kind of things are you going to have her to figure out whether she's good enough to be a bitch on the bus tour? 
[01:41:00]  Oh, is that what's going on?  Well, we need bitches on the bus tour.  Yeah, I guess Troy Kwan wants to check some bitches out.  So have Troy try out the broad for the bus tour.  You want to bring him in when she's here?  Yeah, tell Troy he's going to have to try out this girl to see if she's got what it takes to be on the bus tour.  Because we were thinking it's going to be the aunt bus where the bitches are on.  So what is aunt like?  Karaoke?  Maybe some naked karaoke?  You know, I've never been one to shy away from a little naked karaoke. 
[01:41:30]  Right, so maybe we have her do some naked karaoke today.  Exactly.  That sounds really exciting.  Well, her titties will be out when she does it, so that's one thing to keep in my eyes.  And we'll see her vagina.  What?  That's right.  I want to.  Vagina?  Yeah.  I'm trying to behave and be good, and it's really hard.  Why?  Can you make sure help?  No.  I'm just too lost.  I am.  Aww.  Sorry.  No.  It's just how you deliver that. 
[01:42:00]  I am.  I'm just a lost.  I didn't mean to laugh at that.  Dude, you can't.  I meant it to be silly.  Okay, all right.  I really am.  I'm just gone.  She's a man-eater.  Tin, tin, tin.  Bam, bam, bam.  No connection to humanity anymore.  Oh.  Steve in New York is a black guy, and he wants to talk about that N-word thing.  Oh.  Steve in New York, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hi, Steve.  We won't argue this time, Anthony.  I just want to put the word nigger in a little perspective.  The vast majority of black people in this country find the word very offensive. 
[01:42:30]  And why is it in all your music?  Well, I mean, I'll dress up briefly, too.  But the point is, entertainers have a different perspective.  They have different motivations for using the word, and they have different sensitivity  levels.  But they do not represent the vast majority of black people who understand history, who  understand Jim Crow, slavery, discrimination, lynching, and the whole thing. 
[01:43:00]  And I'm not going to get into all that.  I love it.  It is a very significant part of not only black history, but American history.  It doesn't only have to be entertainers, sir, because if you watch a lot of videos on the  YouTubes and whatnot, you will hear a lot of young black men, and girls especially, yeah,  using the word nigger without a problem.  And even though there are people that you say that find the word very offensive and don't 
[01:43:30]  use that in the black community, they will not have the same reaction hearing a bunch  of kids, black kids on the streets saying it, as they would hearing white people say  it.  That's not right.  It is absolutely true.  Hold on.  And I got to jump in on this one, too, because I walk around Manhattan.  You cannot walk by, and it's telling the truth on this, man.  You cannot walk by a bunch of black kids without hearing that word at least 12 fucking times.  Think about what you're saying, a bunch of black kids. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, put it in perspective.  All right, but why isn't it?  Hold on.  Hold on, sir.  But that's where you got to start.  Why isn't that word important to the black kids?  If it was such a bad word, why would they use it so much?  Well, unfortunately, black kids are superficial to some extent, and obviously they follow rappers.  They admire rappers, and they're going to adapt to whatever they do. 
[01:44:30]  But it takes the power away from the word if they're just throwing it around like it's  nothing, right?  I agree.  I agree.  And then we're supposed to understand that it's such a powerful word.  We don't see it that way if you hear it wherever you go.  Well, that's only because you're hearing it again from a majority of black people.  Black youth do not represent the majority of black people.  Right, right, right.  But my point being that if an adult, a black person that has no fucking, they don't say 
[01:45:00]  nigger.  They don't like it.  They're offended by it.  They will absolutely not have the same reaction in hearing another black person say it and  hearing a white person say it.  Again, but you're wrong.  No, I'm not wrong.  I personally react to it when I hear it from black youth, particularly a few years ago before  the use of it became prevalent in the use of macular, you know. 
[01:45:30]  But it's still offensive, again, to the majority.  It's more offensive if a white person says it, though.  It's more offensive to blacks if a white person says it.  Well, that's retarded.  Well, I have a question for you, too.  I understand.  Look, I look, I get I understand why it would be more.  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but I get why it would be more offensive.  Like if, hey, look at the ass on her.  A lot a lot of people would find it more offensive if a black guy said that about a white woman 
[01:46:00]  than if a white guy said it about another white woman.  We just probably we look at me.  I'm not saying that's right or wrong, but it is what it is.  But do you, as you know, you're a black guy, how do you feel about the phony?  Like at least black people will have these racial discussions.  What how phony do you think most white people are when they act so completely ignorant to  the fact that black people have strong racial feelings, some that are not pleasant about 
[01:46:30]  white people, too?  Well, I think, again, you have to put blame on the media because their only interest is,  as you alluded to earlier in the show, is basically to ride an issue for as long as it's hot and  it will generate interest.  And, you know, they have a particular perspective and self-interest as well.  So you I believe that the media really doesn't support a true equality. 
[01:47:00]  I think they basically have a business objective and that's what they perpetuate.  But do you think that even perspective as far as I mean, I can't speak for all white people.  I work with a lot of white people.  I know a lot of white people.  I grew up with white people.  Yeah, I agree.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I work.  Right.  You know, I mean, I would say it's with no, no, I mean, do you think, sir, it just drives  me crazy that that like you're right about the media, but I think the media more than 
[01:47:30]  just milking a subject, I really believe they have an agenda to like like they have they  purposely don't report racial it like why won't they give black people the same thought  process and motivation?  It's such a really weird like whenever like the Marine case that we're talking about.  Now, I know that that stuff happens, but they're actually saying that the robbery was  the motive.  Like they're saying that blacks are behaving in a way where they go to rob you and they  just happen to rape and torture you and try to burn you all like.  But whenever white people commit these violent acts against blacks, there has to be a thought 
[01:48:00]  out motive.  It's a really weird, subtle arrogance.  Again, it's all you said, it's also a thing.  There's self-interest.  I mean, they're about selling newspapers.  They're about selling their programs.  Well, racially motivated, but racially motivated stories will sell newspapers.  Why do they purposefully steer clear of that yet a racially motivated story where a white 
[01:48:30]  perpetrator and a black victim is splashed all over the news?  That's huge.  But the other way around, I still think it would sell papers, make the news, get ratings,  but they steer clear of it regardless of that.  So I don't even think ratings is the answer because they're not going for the story that  would get the ratings.  No, I don't think so.  There has been, I guess, in recent years.  The media has been a little bit more sensitive to putting on the airwaves every night some 
[01:49:00]  black-on-black crime and other negative things.  Negative?  That's just news.  I find it offensive they don't cover all that.  There's fucking another 15 people shot, eight dead, eight people killed over the weekend  in Baltimore, and nothing.  Nothing.  Paula Deen saying it is headline news.  I agree with you.  That's horrible.  It should be covered.  It should be gutwood aggressively.  It should be gutwood intelligently. 
[01:49:30]  Because nothing's going to be done unless people even identify the fact that this shit's  happening.  Well, we're too busy wasting time on Paula Deen.  Exactly.  Paula Deen said nigger, so holy shit, we've got to fucking crucify her while blacks are  killing blacks in every major city on the weekends like it's fucking, like it's festival.  Well, you're suggesting perhaps that the media doesn't give a fuck about the black community.  Do you know what?  They really don't.  In a way, they don't.  You're right.  They don't, right.  They understand that this goes on, and they fail to adequately cover. 
[01:50:00]  I agree with you.  Do you know why, do you know why, sorry to interrupt you, do you know why you can tell  they don't care?  Because they have such a higher behavioral expectation for white people, so they're scolding  people they see as the other adults.  And whenever, and you know, guys like Patrice always talk about, like, whenever they cover,  like, say there was a black female soldier who was missing, and then when the white one  wiped it, like every missing kid you see on the news, every missing kid that becomes 
[01:50:30]  the story is a little white kid, like, that's how the media really reveals.  The blonde of the hair, the mortal care.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, you know, God rest his soul.  I mean, he was absolutely right.  He was great.  You know, and it is a shame also, they're not, the media's not only selling the black community  short, they're selling the white community short, too.  I agree.  They're basically catering to people who are not on a particularly sophisticated level, sufficiently 
[01:51:00]  enough to understand the problems and how to deal with them.  Oh, you think I like having to troll through a bunch of websites to get my black-on-black  crime stats?  Jesus Christ.  I would love to just tune in the news and watch it on one channel.  Yeah, but I'd like you to kind of put it in perspective.  Oh.  I mean, you know.  Oh, that.  Oh, perspective.  Hey, more importantly, hold on, hold on.  More importantly, you think a black guy could tightrope across the Grand Canyon?  I don't think a black guy would try to do that.  He'd have to pull his pants up, because the pant thing would get in the way. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, Opie, that's a stereotype right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, sir, what's your solution to the whole N-word thing?  Because, you know, goofy white people, when they see kids just throwing around like it's  nothing, we don't really see the power in the word.  Yeah, we want to play.  We understand the older generations, you know, it means a hell of a lot more to, you know,  older black people than the youth.  So what's the solution?  Well, the solution is to speak out whenever you could as a black person. 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  You know, I talk to my kids.  I talk to black youth.  You know, again, when I hear the word, there's a visceral reaction to it that is quite confrontational  sometimes.  So do you try to explain that to the younger black people?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, I'm not hearing, you know, the word big is used by a lot of white people in the  city.  No.  No.  You know what?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on. 
[01:52:30]  I got to.  I got things to say.  I got things to say.  I do.  I do hear white kids saying it a lot when I walk around the city.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  When they're with black people, with black kids.  It's really strange.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a whole, you know.  It's almost like it's accepted on.  Buddy.  It's almost accepted in, I don't know, like the junior high slash high school level.  Well, I absolutely have heard it.  See, that's your bit, Ant.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're doing Ant's bit on TV.  I guess they brought a tightrope over there by Fox News, and the anchors are trying it 
[01:53:00]  out.  And the people from Fox and Friends are walking on it.  Look at me.  Whoa.  It was just a beam.  Oh, with your dumb suit.  That's Carol Alt, who's still fucking hot.  I don't know how she's not aging.  Anyway, sorry, Steve.  Yes.  Yeah, I absolutely have seen, you know, kids of all colors using the word as they walk  around with their pals.  Yeah, and it's disturbing, and it burns my ears, and the ears of black people like myself. 
[01:53:30]  We hear that.  No doubt about it.  But unfortunately, you know, the word has been trivialized to some extent, and people  who really don't have a perspective about history, about some aspects of morality and  unity, community, they're not going to understand the significance of it, and they're going  to react in a very, very cavalier way, and they do, particularly if they're influenced  by, you know, I have to say that some of the idiots in the rap industry who don't understand 
[01:54:00]  the history, or don't care about it.  Like Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  He's had that in his...  Ice-T has said it many times.  Which one we have?  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  Ice-T.  We had Ice-T, not Ice-T.  Ice-T.  And Adam Walsh.  But Ice-T's got the N-word in all his songs, right?  But if you said it to his face, he'd be really fucking pissed off, right? 
[01:54:30]  Bet you're right.  That is so confusing to a white guy.  Absolutely.  Really confusing.  Absolutely.  Again, it's a matter of what...  Not that I'd want to, by the way.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  I don't have any desire to fucking...  Oh, please.  You guys throw a nigger around like it's...  Not all of us.  Never.  You know, it's funny.  It's like, when discussing the word, it's a really weird thing.  Like, on stage, I've been talking about Paula Deen.  Right.  And the first night, like, I don't use nigger as a punchline, and I don't like saying 
[01:55:00]  the N-word.  It's not because I think I should be able to get away with it.  Right.  It's because there's a dishonesty in it, and it's like, it's a word that you kind of should  feel jarred when you hear.  Like, meaning...  Of course.  It's a fucking harsh word.  And you better...  If you use it, you better use it selectively and in the right context, or people are going  to pull back from you.  Yeah.  Or you're going to get your teeth knocked out.  Oh, yeah.  If you use it angrily towards somebody.  Sure.  But, I mean, even mentioning on stage and saying, Paula Deen said nigger.  I said that.  And the audience pulls back.  They stop breathing for a second, right? 
[01:55:30]  That's hilarious.  And they look at the black people, and the bit didn't work as well.  So last night I'm on, and I'm talking about it, and I said, there's the N-word.  And I address why I say the N-word.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But the bit worked a lot better.  Wow.  That might be a better bit.  Because I could see how you would be just disgusted.  That's weird.  Yes.  The problem with Paula Deen, though, is that she represents a public entity, a public interest.  And once you are in that position, you have to be very careful about the... 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, but it's something she said a long time ago that had nothing to do with what she's  doing for a living.  So why are we fucking crucifying her for that?  Don't you understand that doesn't make sense?  I don't think she should be fired for this particular incident.  Everyone represents somebody's interest.  If you have a job, you represent somebody's interest.  Your life shouldn't go down the shitter, because in your personal life, you decide to use an  offensive word.  And hold on.  If we were going to think that way, then we should just all unplug our TVs, because you're 
[01:56:30]  not going to find one person that's squeaky clean that doesn't have some shit in their  past.  Well, I agree.  I agree.  Again, I'm not saying that's right or wrong.  I'm just putting it in perspective and understand the interest behind that, the interest of the owner  of the entertainment entity.  I get their reasoning why they fired Paula Deen, but we're saying here today that it's  completely and utterly ridiculous.  I agree.  All right.  You know what I would like to... 
[01:57:00]  I'm sorry.  I think she should be fired under those circumstances.  I agree.  I wish that black people would...  Like you...  How old a guy are you, Steve?  Boy, do I have answers to that.  I'm in my early 50s.  Okay.  So you understand how white people are.  You've been around enough white people.  And doesn't it bother you the fucking fake indignation?  Like to say, hey, look, that's a lousy word and it's shitty.  She said it.  Okay.  Fair enough.  But this fake...  Oh my God!  Did you hear Paula Deen say it? 
[01:57:30]  Doesn't that annoy you as an adult?  Embarrassing.  I don't see people on the street doing that.  No, but I mean the media, the press.  Again, the media, again.  Certain interest groups, yeah.  Right.  It's not the majority of people, right.  Right.  Of course.  The majority of people have no action.  They mostly don't care.  You're right.  Yeah.  It's complete apathy.  They don't care.  Yeah.  All right.  It's only when the media drives their interest that these things happen.  All right, Holmes.  We got some big boobies waiting for us and a girl with a nice big black... 
[01:58:00]  A cast that's about to enter the studio.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  Steve, good call, by the way.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  All right.  It's so nice to talk to Steve without yelling.  Yeah.  That was kind of nice.  A little conversation.  It's kind of nice.  Yeah, I've absolutely seen the white kids hanging out with the black kids throwing the  word around.  Not every single time, but certainly enough where I go, wow, that is so fucking strange  to see.  I'll use nigga in my texts sometimes. 
[01:58:30]  I'll be like, hey, where you at, nigga?  Because it's kind of funny.  You know?  But I'm not just walking around saying nigger all the time.  Hey, nigger.  Like, in context, it's a word.  Just fucking stop with this outrage of a fucking word flying out of your mouth.  It has a harsh...  It's a harsh word.  And he's right.  It has a terrible history.  But the reaction to it is irrational and fake.  Yes.  Because people don't know the difference between somebody who admits they've said it in their 
[01:59:00]  private life and somebody saying it in a public forum angrily.  It's like, why are we so dishonest with each other?  I also cannot stand having to walk on eggshells and tiptoe around black people's feelings.  And regardless of who's to blame in that fact, is it black leadership and interest groups that have pushed this agenda?  Is it the white media that has made it so taboo to even criticize a black person?  But the idea that as white people we have to tiptoe around and not fucking watch out for the words we say, watch out for terms we use. 
[01:59:30]  Don't say inner city because we know you mean nigger.  What?  Just stop it.  And it's insulting to see white people begging for their fucking lives because they have to appease this fucking air of infallibility and excuses and all this other shit that goes along with having to kowtow to black people. 
[02:00:00]  It's all white phoniness.  Not at all.  Every ounce of it.  Black people don't fire you.  They're a minority in this country, like, numbers-wise.  The people attacking, if white people as a whole were honest with themselves about race, even when somebody slipped up and did something stupid like that, if they didn't pile on and attack, the discussion would happen.  It came from somewhere.  White people?  No, I think it came from when black people started getting power, getting a power base, coming out of the civil rights problems of the 60s into the 70s and 80s and started getting a power base. 
[02:00:30]  They fucking poured it on.  And white people got petrified.  And that's where we're at now.  Scared white people that are afraid to even criticize.  Like, I heard on the news this morning, Nelson Mandela is in bad shape.  He's like 94 fucking years old.  He's in the hospital, blah, blah, blah.  There's some shit to do with Nelson Mandela that was pretty fucking stupid and shitty. 
[02:01:00]  And no one can criticize the man because he's a fucking saint.  But, uh, and if you do, they will call you racist.  Not just, oh, I'm familiar with his history and his fucking wife's history.  Perhaps that's what I'm talking about.  But, uh, there's this tiptoeing, walking on eggshells thing, Jimmy.  I agree.  I'm not a big fan of.  It's not, I fault, dishonest, fucking fake, afraid, because by scolding me or scolding  you, the person doing the scolding doesn't have to admit the ugliness in themselves. 
[02:01:30]  It's all fucking fake, uh, white people trying to deflect attention from themselves.  That, I'm not talking about when someone is being a true racist.  Yeah, you should kind of stand up against that.  It's sickening.  But when it's not real racism, when it's just people trying to make themselves look  better, that's what we do.  We take pop culture figures and we use them to make ourselves look better.  Oh my God, look what she said.  I've never said that.  It's an opportunity for fake white people to say to black people, see, I'm a good one. 
[02:02:00]  That's all it is.  That's not black people forcing that.  That's fucking white people.  But what I see, again, is just another excuse that's blaming white people for things to  do with racial issues between whites and blacks.  And here's my observation.  We're having a nice discussion about the word, right?  Sure.  Going back and forth and really getting into it.  Yeah.  I look up CNN with that big bitch.  Yeah.  They're talking about how Twinkies are back.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  They should be talking about this shit.  No real discussions.  No, there's no discussions about race.  How did this happen?  We were the goofy, like, let's shove a Twinkie up a girl's ass type of guys.  Hey, I'll still go for that.  And now we get into some of this, as we like to say, that tough lifting and these controversial  subjects.  And they're talking about Twinkies.  They'll never do it.  Twinkies are coming back.  And then Fox had them bouncing on a stupid beam.  Walking a tightrope.  It's amazing.  And I'm only blaming white people.  Which makes your point, Jimmy.  They're too scared to fucking have this discussion. 
[02:03:00]  So they've got to fill up their time so they find the Twinkie story.  There is an element of fear.  Fear does come into play.  It's not just this paternalistic or maternalistic.  Feeling that, oh, these are the young children that have the excuse.  We're the adults.  We have to act a certain way.  They're just children.  Don't worry about it.  I understand that white part of it.  But there is also a black element of let's use our power.  I think certain black people and certain black organizations relish watching white people  squirm. 
[02:03:30]  Love it.  And love that power base it gives them to keep white people from saying certain things,  from criticizing, from getting into certain organizations.  It's just...  But white people like to see black people squirm, too.  Not as much as the old days.  That's for shit short.  But, you know, you talk to black people, you would think...  When Reverend Allen is talking out his ass, you don't like seeing him squirm.  I love it.  Although he rarely squirms.  You know, there's, again, that weird infallibility on these people because we have to walk on  eggshells around them. 
[02:04:00]  But I know you're right about the groups that like to see white people squirm.  Yeah.  But if other white people...  And I'm not saying white people should band together.  I'm saying that when they do it, they're being full of shit and they're not being honest.  And so real racists are kind of lumped in with people who have just said casual things  that we've all said.  Right.  I don't think the head of the Food Network gives a flying fuck if she said nigger back  20 fucking years ago.  It's the same thing as gay politicians who legislate against homosexuals and then suck dick on them.  It's the same fraudulent... 
[02:04:30]  Not as sexy.  Of course.  Exactly.  Can't jerk off to the racism story.  Of course.  Wait, she said it 20 years ago.  I don't even know.  It was a while ago.  How many years?  I'm not sure.  For real, but it was...  Before her Food Network days, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what she was saying.  Even though she should be able to say that in her private life during her Food Network days.  Yeah, that she's being sued.  But we're talking about something she did before...  She should have lied and said, no, I never said that word in my life.  I'm offended that you would even suggest it.  Goes there.  And we've had that discussion.  You're just going to hear really... 
[02:05:00]  You're going to see really boring TV because no one's going to be willing to give their  opinion on anything.  No.  Because it's your job in the end.  And rightly so because, yeah, they'll ask you the question like Jimmy's brought up many  times.  They ask you the fucking question.  You give the honest answer and they will turn around and hang you with your honest answer.  When you weren't even soliciting it, you weren't just going around going, here's how I feel.  They asked you.  That's not how the real world works.  It's crazy.  It is.  That's crazy talk.  And by the way, who hired Reverend Al?  The fact that Reverend Al Sharpton has a job on MSNBC... 
[02:05:30]  Self-appointed, self-anointed.  Well, it goes to Jimmy's point.  That's why he's bringing it up.  That's the white people.  The white people hired Reverend Al.  They were scared shitless of this guy and the power he has and what he could do to their  network.  MSNBC.  Who are you kidding?  XM hired him too.  Yeah.  Let's not forget.  Is his show still on?  I don't even know anymore.  I don't think so.  But they hired him because they were scared of...  He starts sniffing around because of the trouble we got in. 
[02:06:00]  The homeless Charlie thing.  So one of the things they did was they turned around and made a deal with Reverend Al to calm  him the fuck down.  Now, that is a fact.  And white people did that.  Smart black people tap into...  When you say they like to see white people squirm, that just means that there are black  people that have figured out how fucking...  How to tap into that fake horse shit.  Yeah.  Because Patrice said it brilliantly, I've never met a racist.  Like, there are people that are genuinely racist. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  And he's like, no one has ever admitted...  And I'm not saying...  Oh, Patrice met a racist.  But he says he never, ever...  Oh, I loved one, actually.  Came over at my house.  I didn't say who it was.  But people won't even admit racist thoughts.  Yeah.  Like...  So phony.  That's what drives me nuts.  Yeah.  Like, when you...  And if you do admit one, everybody covers up their own sins and goes, you're a racist.  Instead of going, yeah, I relate.  It's like you talk about jerking off.  Most guys in this day and age will go, yeah, me too.  But when you talk about racist, like the 1950s, talking about jerking off, you say it, everybody 
[02:07:00]  else is like, what are you, homo?  What are you, grab your dick?  What's wrong with you?  That's what it's like now.  Yes.  And it's...  It's like everybody's making pretend.  Yeah.  I wonder where it goes at this juncture.  Where Canada is right now.  That's where we're going.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, where the fucking...  The PC police are literally the PC police.  Well, we could talk about it after the break.  It's in trouble.  Yeah.  We're waiting for Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby should be here soon.  Bobby.  Is he here?  All right.  So Bobby will be joining the program next. 
[02:07:30]  And this lady, Melanie Monroe.  Yes.  From Penthouse.  Who I love.  Who Jimmy loves.  She seems like she's cool.  We'll have her on.  Yeah, ready for some titties.  We'll have her on in about a half hour, right?  Yes.  Kool-Aid.  Ah.  I see it outside.  Who wants to stop it?  Do we have time or we have...  Well, bring him in for it.  Ice kill.  Ice take.  I mean, ice take.  Holy shit.  I'll tell you later.  I'll tell you later.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[02:08:00]  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly in studio.  How are you, Bobby?  I'm tired, man.  First time we're seeing Bobby.  Well, I am seeing Bobby as he's a new daddy. 
[02:08:30]  Congratulations.  It's so funny.  Same here.  Yeah.  Let's hug it out.  Hi, buddy.  Hug it out.  I know it's...  I try to think of people that I know as I'm experiencing this stuff.  I try to think of people that I know.  Who could...  What would happen to this guy?  Like, and I've thought of Anthony.  Oh, like if they had kids?  If you had to do what I have had to do for the last three weeks, it would just be...  That would be a great show.  Oh, no.  Just to give a guy like him a kid for a week.  That would be a great reality show.  For a week.  Let's do this. 
[02:09:00]  Let's do this.  For a week.  No.  Hey, I got a couple questions really fast.  Yeah, what's up?  Did you look?  Did you get squeamish?  You know, walk me through it fast.  I know you went over with Jimmy and Sam the other day.  I didn't get squeamish at all because I didn't look at all.  Because you were panicking that you were going to lose it a little bit, right?  I was panicking.  Because we had our conversations.  Yeah, because it was...  There's a lot of blood, though.  The blood starts...  This is what people are going to tell you.  The blood starts immediately when you go to the hospital and they check her cervix.  Because they don't check...  There's not a cervix checker machine. 
[02:09:30]  There's a hand.  Do they pop any shit?  No, the water broke at the house.  Oh, really?  You didn't get to see a rod?  No.  They pop shit at it.  What do you mean?  Well, suddenly they go, oh, we got to break your water.  Oh, the water?  They have like a thing and they fucking go in there with a hook and they pop shit.  Whoa.  They got to go in and get the mucus plug, it's called.  Yeah.  Oh, I heard about the mucus plug.  Yeah, because it's so hard to sell out mucus. 
[02:10:00]  That's a gig.  Right.  You're plugging it.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, it was...  She stuck her hand up my...  They just...  But they don't have any tenderness in them.  It's not like...  They just go, let me...  Right, right.  And then they pull it out and just...  It's blood.  You think it's delicate fucking procedure, right?  It's not.  It's like dating Andre the Giant for the first time.  Did you see the crowning of the head?  That's the only time I looked is when she said the head's halfway out. 
[02:10:30]  So you were up near the shoulder, right?  Up near the shoulder.  That's where the guys usually...  Right shoulder, right?  Right shoulder.  Right shoulder.  That's the place to be.  You know what amazed me, though, is it's very nonchalant.  There was a nurse, the doctor, and myself.  And that's it.  Like, I thought a team of people come in and we get...  We have to put stuff on our feet and our face.  Did they come in with a tray of tools?  Yeah, they...  But that was their from...  That was their cover.  Tools you've never seen before in your life?  She didn't use...  I don't even think she used them, though.  Really? 
[02:11:00]  Did it look like the fucking table at the end of Braveheart?  Yes.  The book and the rope and the...  They bring this fucking, like, tray and it's all...  My baby comes out, freedom!  Yeah.  It's all sorts of shit you've never seen before.  I think there was a catcher's mitt on the tray, just in case.  It was pretty well.  And then she puts all her shit on and she kneels down.  Well, the doctor...  The doctor said...  She put her shield on so she doesn't get any splatter.  Yeah, she...  Going in.  She put it on quick, though, because she didn't think the kid...  She's like, you're 10 centimeters, and she goes, 
[02:11:30]  you're going to try to practice push.  Right.  And my wife practiced push, but I think she's from Everett, Mass.  She didn't know she was, like, a strong broad.  Oh, really?  So you halfway push the kid out.  So the doctor went, whoa!  How long was labor?  20 minutes.  Well, she was in labor for 12 hours, or I guess 24 hours.  Right.  But it took 20 minutes to get the kid out.  You didn't have to sleep uncomfortably on that chair they give the guys?  I did, but she was fine.  She had the...  Yeah.  She had the... 
[02:12:00]  What is it called?  The epidural?  Yeah.  She was out.  What was the room?  Messy?  Our room wasn't messy.  No.  But supposedly the room gets really messy.  You're in this, like, really, really nice room.  Yeah.  And you can't imagine.  They say, oh, my God, you can't...  It looks like a murder scene sometimes.  No.  This nurse, this nurse that was there...  After they're done.  There was a nurse that was there.  It was this...  She was really a young girl.  And then halfway...  I'm not kidding.  Halfway through the labor,  just before we were about to push the baby out, 
[02:12:30]  right when we started,  right when we started,  after a couple of pushes,  this nurse comes in,  uh, listen,  you have to go downstairs.  I've got to take over for you.  What?  And my wife goes, what?  Yeah.  She goes, yeah.  And she's like, yeah.  This girl is really nice.  She's like, I have to go.  I'm a traveling nurse.  And they just send me wherever I have to go.  And my wife's like,  I don't want her.  She pointed right at the lady's face.  Right.  I don't want fucking...  We're never going to make it.  Yeah, they don't care.  They do 10 of those a day. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  It was pretty basic.  It's not special to them.  It's not a special moment for them.  The lady that was monitoring all the machines,  it was a bad allergy day for her,  so she took a pill.  Like, the non...  It wasn't non-drowsy either.  She went all in and we're like, great.  And I think it was my mother-in-law,  she kind of said a thing or two.  Like, well, you know,  our lady in there that's looking at the instruments,  she just took a fucking pill.  I'm trying to remember what it was.  Oh, like Sudafed.  Vicodin.  Yeah, like Sudafed.  Her arm in it. 
[02:13:30]  We don't want a lady that just took a Sudafed  because it's a bad allergy day.  Maybe if it was non-drowsy.  To them, it's just the day at work.  I know, I know.  Did you cry when the baby was born, Bobby?  We have the same lackluster attitude  we have coming in here every morning.  But we're not delivering kids, man.  Yes, we're doing something more important.  We're bringing mirth.  Mirth, jocularity.  I like it.  Yes.  Did you cry?  I cried.  Oh, like a baby.  But it's hard to connect to the situation, though.  You think you're immediately going to be like, 
[02:14:00]  oh, my, you're in shock.  Yeah.  I saw a head, a half a head coming out of a vagina.  Holy fuck.  When the hair met hair, that's a freaky thing to see.  Oh, man.  And then it comes out.  Full head of hair.  Yeah.  And then it comes out and it's on, and you're like, what the fuck is going on?  See, guys aren't being honest.  I think most guys, their reaction is, what the fuck just happened?  Not this loving moment of like, holy shit, my son was just born. 
[02:14:30]  You're like, an alien just popped out of my wife.  But my wife did that, too, though.  Can we talk about this?  My wife wasn't connected fully.  She was trying to connect.  Well, because it's so fucked up.  And then, of course, you connect immediately.  But that first moment, you're like, what the fuck is this?  I actually think the connection is still happening.  Yeah.  As he gets, I connect with him every day more and more, as he looks, you know, I see his  eyes, he gets fuller, his legs, and he does cuter shit.  You know what I mean?  He's already doing cuter shit? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  You know, he makes a poo face.  It looks like, yeah.  What's that?  His face.  Edgar?  He's just looking for a nipple.  He's not entertaining.  He's not entertaining.  No, not you, Edgar.  The baby.  He's not doing anything.  I know.  He's just looking for a nipple.  I know.  He can only see about, I think, two centimeters in front of his fucking eyes at this point.  He's got blue eyes right now.  I hope he keeps them.  I'd love a little Travolta.  They don't change, do they?  Yeah, they do.  They change.  Hair changes.  He's got blonde hair when I was a baby. 
[02:15:30]  I was a blonde kid until I was about four.  Yeah, me too.  Yeah.  I did.  I didn't.  Wait, but what color was your hair when you were born?  I don't know.  I don't think I had much.  I was a blood clot pretty baby.  That's what my Jamaican friend wrote on my picture.  You was a blood clot pretty baby.  My son was born a ginger, and now he's got white hair, basically.  White blonde hair.  So is that going to change again?  Like a lethal weapon villain.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:16:00]  Does that change again?  Joshua, you're something.  Does it change again, though?  Make up their mind.  What color is he going to have?  Dr. Steve has saved my life, by the way.  Dr. Steve.  Did you call him every other second?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Oh, God.  Because your real doctor has no time for you.  Thank God we have a friend that happens to be a doctor.  Oh, they'll call you back two hours later.  Yeah.  The kid's blue.  He's already in the barrel.  Oh, my God.  He's not joking, though, man.  You got these, you know, especially a new parent. 
[02:16:30]  When you get the second one, you kind of relax a little bit.  But that first one, you don't know what half this shit means.  And you call your pediatrician, and they're like, oh, this again.  So they get back to you eventually while you sit at home panicking for hours.  I put his diaper on wrong, and his belly button thing came off.  And I was like, oh, shit.  I fucked it up.  It's supposed to just fall off, and I ripped it up.  And you hear all the air comes out of it.  It flies around the room.  It looks like a blown-out fucking balloon, man.  That's been in the sun a little too long, huh, Bobby? 
[02:17:00]  A little dry or what?  It was disgusting, man.  Jerky.  A little beef jerky.  It just pops off one day.  You're like, what the fuck?  Christ.  Yeah, it just comes the fuck off.  And you keep it.  She has it in, like, a book.  Nah, see, don't do that.  She kept it.  That's terrible.  She has a memory book.  Aw.  With all these things she has to collect?  The, the, uh...  Did she smear the duty on the duty page?  The duty?  Is it a duty page?  No.  What?  That'd be the worst thing.  His first duty. 
[02:17:30]  Did she smear the duty on the duty page?  No.  You might want to look in the book.  But he shit outside for the first time at Bye Bye Baby.  And I had to go into the men's bathroom with a baby and use one of those folded...  Baby table?  Right.  Which I've, I've walked by my whole life and went, fuck off.  You don't even know how to unfold it.  I used to just snort lines off of it.  That's the only experience I had with.  Anthony fucks chicks on them.  Bye Bye Baby.  Bye Bye Baby is a terrible name for a story.  They're too young to tell. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I think Bye Bye Baby is a horrendous name for a baby store, if you think about it.  Yeah, I know.  It's a great name for an abortion clinic.  Except, yes!  Oh, shit!  But someone on a corporate level said, no, there's a perfect name for a baby store.  Bye Bye Baby.  Hey, we'll take it down to Bye Bye Baby.  We'll get one of those abortions.  Let's name a store after a parent's worst fear.  Oh, my God.  How stupid is that?  Wow.  Isn't it funny, if you drive by, there's just a line of young chicks with mustaches that 
[02:18:30]  don't connect, guys in sunglasses.  Let's make that video.  There's the viral video.  But there was a guy, the baby's shitting so bad it's coming out of the side of the diaper.  Oh, Christ!  Come on, dude!  And then there's a guy, a Bye Bye Baby employee taking just a massive dump.  And his fucking name tag shoots off at one point and just says, Bye Bye Baby Greg. 
[02:19:00]  I don't work at Bye Bye Baby.  Not you.  Oh.  Oh, really, Bobby?  Not me?  Did it fall off on the floor?  No, but mine was...  It came out from under the stall?  Mine was still going with it.  Okay.  Did it come out from under the stall?  It came out from under the stall.  You're kidding, right?  He was taking a shit.  Is that a code for gay sex in the bathroom?  You throw your name tag out at the guy you want to fucking...  Hey, I'll fuck you, Andrew, baby.  Leave the baby on the changing table.  He'll be all right. 
[02:19:30]  Gee.  Yeah, it was...  I panicked.  So you've had some blowouts with the poo.  It was the first one.  Have you had one go all the way up to the neck and you're like, how the fuck is this possible?  The back of the neck?  No.  Wait till you get that one.  I don't want that.  Fuck.  I'm going to get that one.  I don't want that.  Do you carry spare clothes with you?  I'm supposed to.  A spare outfit?  I'm kind of ghetto, too.  I don't...  I leave them on the...  You're ghetto.  My wife, she gets mad.  I'm like, I'm ghetto.  Like, I can handle any situation.  It's New York City.  Yeah, just get a napkin.  She packs like we're going away for a week. 
[02:20:00]  I'm like, we're just going to the park.  Just get...  The carrier.  I've put one diaper on my back without wipes because I'm like, I'll find some...  I'll wet down something.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'll use my hand.  Or I'll put some wipes in like a quick sandwich bag.  But that's it.  That's how I leave the house.  What did they do, you know...  Stay home.  A hundred years ago.  They lived to 35.  I'll tell you.  It's the cloth diapers.  I didn't know how to say that. 
[02:20:30]  They didn't have the disposable diapers and they had the safety pins.  We all got a safety pin to our hip.  And your mom had to wash out the diapers.  Could you imagine washing out the diapers?  So you could reuse them?  So you got to wash out the shit and then you throw them in the fucking washing machine.  That's the sky.  I would never do it.  That's how they had to do it.  Except for people to do that now.  Because you can't afford to throw away cloth diapers.  You got to reuse that shit.  There's rich people that have cloth diaper services.  That's disgusting.  They like that old school. 
[02:21:00]  Have you washed out any of the clothes in the sink yet?  Because they got a little too...  No, I don't wash it.  It's his own.  I don't do laundry.  They're covered in shit.  On the front.  On the front.  That's a big bitch.  Holy fuck.  She's dressed like the sun today.  Sorry.  She's a big bitch on TV I'm obsessed with.  That's a funny clip.  Oh, the spider?  The weather woman going crazy because there was a spider on her green machine.  The staff down beside her.  Huge.  Right. 
[02:21:30]  Very good.  So what else?  Did you...  And then you go home and then all of a sudden you're like, now what?  They don't give you enough fucking directions to take a kid home two days later?  They don't give you enough Vaseline.  Whoa.  What the fuck is that about?  You got to use Vaseline on the butt.  And on the ding-ding on the...  Oh, you have to fucking, yeah, keep it all.  They don't give you...  We actually...  We...  You go to the baby class at the hospital?  We stole everything from the hospital.  Did you steal everything?  We went through everything.  I had a bag full of shit that I... 
[02:22:00]  And then the nurse was like...  She came in and she was like, I need to...  Is there a diaper or...  Where are the diapers?  Don't look in there.  I had to go into my bag and open it up and it was just stacked with shit.  All your stolen goods.  Your booty.  I know everybody does that.  But fuck it, I didn't want to get caught doing it.  Are you walking around the city yet with the kid?  No, I haven't walked around.  I just got a new baby holder.  What are they called?  Oh, my God.  Look at you. 
[02:22:30]  A Bjorn?  Yeah, Bjorn.  Whatever that is.  A front one?  Shit.  Yeah, it's a front back.  I like them.  I'll do that.  Yeah.  I don't mind it.  This sucks about New York.  Nobody gives a shit.  No...  Thank you, Sydney.  My wife has a baby in her arm.  I'm holding a carriage.  We're trying to go up our stairs.  And three stupid fucking dumb white girls on their cell phones.  Oh, my God.  Just walk by.  And don't even help my wife.  Bump into her.  They fucking bumped into her. 
[02:23:00]  Jesus.  Didn't even say sorry.  Yeah, they don't get a fuck.  Just kept fucking walking.  It's a nightmare having a kid in the city.  Yeah, I would assume that's got to be a little fucking nerve-wracking.  It's a little weird.  It's very nerve-wracking.  You walk around like a Vietnam vet just waiting to fucking slice somebody's throat.  It's my whole day with the baby.  You're all protective.  That's what it is.  In your summer in one way, good luck at the playgrounds.  Yeah.  Good fucking luck.  What does that mean?  You're going to pin a three-year-old up against a fence because he tripped your kid or something. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you've got to search him.  I think he stole something.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  No, no.  Of course not.  But I've yelled and screamed at parents before to watch their fucking kids.  What do they say?  Huh?  What do they say?  Oh, they get annoyed.  You'll see.  It's a nightmare.  Going to the playground is a nightmare, especially when they're really young.  Because kids are just passive-aggressive assholes.  They're going to step on your kid.  They're going to push him out of the way to get to something.  And you're going to be sitting there just following him. 
[02:24:00]  And you have to fucking figure it out in your head.  So Uncle Anthony will come with one of his guns.  You'll go.  It drives you insane.  I've bitten my lips so hard because I'm like, fuck, I want to just lose my fucking mind right now.  Crazy.  I don't know.  So that's the part of having the kid that's going to kill me is the part where I know he's going to break his fucking arm.  He's going to get hurt.  He's going to get fucking bullied.  He's going to cry.  He's going to get all fucked.  Pounds per square inch per second per second.  I'll tell you one. 
[02:24:30]  My kid recently discovered water balloons.  So we go to the playground with water balloons.  And I gave him a blue water balloon, right?  And he was amazed by the whole fucking thing but didn't understand the concept of water balloons.  He thinks he had this blue fucking water balloon forever now.  Sure.  Like he's going to bring it home and put it right next to his Buzz Lightyear.  Like, holy fuck, look what daddy gave me.  So he's on the swing and he drops the water balloon and it breaks.  He lost his fucking mind.  He couldn't put his head around what the fuck happened.  And he's screaming, my balloon, my balloon, it broke, it broke. 
[02:25:00]  And I'm sitting there going, how the fuck am I going to ever teach this kid what a girl could do to him?  Exactly.  If he can't handle a water balloon breaking.  Hopefully he'll drop one on the fucking sidewalk and see.  Best way to break up with a girl.  You know what a woman can do to you if you can't handle a water balloon?  Losing a balloon, yeah.  A water balloon?  Oh, boy.  But he couldn't understand.  He just couldn't wrap his little head around it.  It's like, no, it popped.  And I don't even know what the words are.  But then a week later, he's now throwing them. 
[02:25:30]  He gets it now.  But that first time, he was like, what the fuck just happened in my little brain?  Yeah, that stuff is overwhelming to me.  Like, I'm so, I'm so, like, second by second with this thing.  Yeah, with this thing.  I'm literally, let me just, I'm doing this today.  I'm going to try to do this today.  And that's it.  Like, I don't, I tell my wife, don't.  One day at a time.  I can't, I really can't.  I start hearing that stuff.  And I'm like, I want to Google how to teach you about death.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  I get fucked.  You'll just be gone, man.  Holy fuck.  If you look too far, if you look too far ahead, it fucks you up.  It really makes you go, what the, what, what's going on?  Yeah.  Because I look at my friends, you know, you got, you got the friends that just go home.  Now I know you're lying.  My friend.  Sorry, I put an S at the end of that.  Yeah.  So you look at your friends, like Norton and Anthony and go, what the fuck?  Like, these guys just get to watch TV. 
[02:26:30]  They get to sit down and watch a movie from front to end.  Yeah.  Christmas morning, we get to wake up alone again and look at no tree, no presents.  Oh, yeah.  It's a wonderful life.  You get to have another escort come over and do nothing and your dick doesn't work.  And you're like, why am I doing this?  I just want to hug someone.  Can someone just love me?  I just do cunts out to lunch.  Not even the courtesy of a response.  Why do you get hookers? 
[02:27:00]  I don't know, you fucking cunts.  Because I ask you out to lunch and you don't get back to me.  That's why.  So this is, uh.  Shit, I'm crying.  So that's what you've taken away from the whole thing?  That's exactly what I've taken away from it.  Question after, hey, you want to go out to lunch?  Nothing.  You want to go grab some food?  Nothing.  What the fuck?  What's that all about, Jimmy?  We get to all these.  I'm happy to have a baby and a family.  I can't wait for Christmas. 
[02:27:30]  Very lucky, man.  This Christmas, you want to get a tree.  Oh, you'll have a tree.  You'll get a baby's first Christmas.  It's, I don't know.  It sounds gay.  But, I mean, yeah, there's things I'm like, oh, yeah, that'd be nice.  But I don't know.  Everyone here says, no, it doesn't sound gay.  Sure, there's things I miss doing.  There's things I miss doing.  But, I mean, it's going to sound horrible.  But I wouldn't have it any other way now.  Like, you know, it's...  Yeah, you just...  This is the weird part.  You just go.  You don't even really...  You think about it for a second. 
[02:28:00]  You just go.  Like, I was up all night with a kid.  He didn't shit.  I had to help him poo.  How'd you help him?  You got a...  A little Vaseline around the rim?  A little pinky.  A little pinky?  You got to rim your kid with a little fucking Vaseline.  You got to put...  I do what makes me shit.  You got to go inside a little bit, too, sometimes.  A little bit.  Give him a coffee.  A little bit, Bobby.  Give him a coffee and tell me he's got to sit on the subway.  And then all of a sudden, his body will go, time to shit.  Prunes are an amazing thing. 
[02:28:30]  You're going to...  Well, he's not eating anything yet.  Not yet.  Prunes are going to become your friend one day.  I put a...  I get a warm baby wipe and wipe his butt.  And then I push down on his stomach and he just shits.  What kind of gadgets do you have?  Wow.  That's what I've been wanting to ask you.  Because you're a...  You're the gadget king.  I have the best baby monitor out there.  Yeah, all right.  But do you have, like, the baby wipe warmer?  Yes, I do.  Oh, gosh.  I don't know why we don't have that as adults.  It's a baby wipe warmer.  Or you get a baby wipe and it's warm when you wipe your asshole. 
[02:29:00]  It's so nice.  So let's go on Shark Tank.  There's our idea.  What?  They already have it.  You just have to buy one and put it in your bathroom and use it as an adult, you asshole.  I'm just hoping it could be our idea.  We just erase the baby part.  Shark Tank.  Oh, that stupid joke.  Let's do it.  I didn't know.  I thought you were talking about the one where they build the fucking fish tanks.  No, Shark Tank.  My idea is we're going to take the baby wipe warmer,  but we're going to just erase the baby part.  And just put a wipe warmer. 
[02:29:30]  Wipe warmer.  Wipe warmer.  There you go.  You know what, though?  Who doesn't like the cool wipe?  Sometimes you've got to cool some shit down.  If you've got to use the wipe, you like it kind of cool.  Right.  So maybe an air-conditioned one.  Yeah.  There you go.  Let's go the other way.  Like a nice Mexican meal.  Yeah.  There you go.  Or toilet paper with little fans on each piece.  That's blowing to your asshole as you wipe.  You have to plug in each piece of toilet paper.  Oh, I thought you meant like fans of this show.  Oh, no, no.  And they go. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Do you really want to have kids someday?  I think so.  It's not that I want to have kids.  I think he wants to be in a really nice relationship.  I just want someone with a cunt to have lunch with me.  Fucking rotten over 30 fucking oinkers.  You wonder why you're single at your age.  Flaky whores.  I want a nice guy.  Shut up. 
[02:30:30]  Fucking liars.  Oh, my God.  I'm telling you, man.  Being a piece of garbage is the only way to go.  I've tried the nice route.  It literally does not work.  No, huh?  Does not work.  Are you willing to put in the times?  With some of these women, you've got to put in the time.  Dude, I've actually said to...  You've got to wait maybe a month before you get some action going.  I've said to women, do you want to go to lunch?  Just lunch.  Not dirty texting.  Right, right.  And then they say yes, and they don't get back to you. 
[02:31:00]  And I'm not overbearing, but it's like...  Jesus.  Either A, you just lie, but I'm not even asking you in a pressure-filled way.  Right.  It's just a nice way I'm asking.  So fuck them.  Why do you get jerked off for money?  That's why.  Maybe you should move out of the city, get a house like Anthony, and have parties, and have  a social circle instead of...  All you do is go to the club and go the fuck home, Jim.  My house is a disaster.  You have no social circle.  But I do talk to enough people and meet enough people.  He's trying. 
[02:31:30]  Jimmy's been trying.  And I love being in the city.  I love where I am.  And if I was in the house, I would just isolate more.  I mean, at least in the city, I can step out.  Why don't you move in with me and Don when we move out?  We'll get you like an apartment.  Hey, there you go.  You take care of the kid.  The dog loves you.  The dog dogs do.  The baby loves him, too.  He's great with the kid.  He holds the kid.  The kid doesn't cry.  He just coos.  Jimmy would probably want to be a dad at some point.  You've still got time.  All I want now is just somebody who can say, you want to meet at the Brooklyn Diner for  a bite.  That sounds nice, Jimmy.  Yeah.  What ends up happening? 
[02:32:00]  No response back.  There's one girl I texted.  Oh, no.  But again, she may have had a boyfriend, so I wouldn't have been mad if she said no.  Okay.  But like you ask, and there's just like literally no response.  And it's like, could you give me the courtesy of, and I can't, or I'd like to, but I'm involved.  Okay.  It wasn't even a date.  I'm not even asking you pigs on dates.  I'm literally not.  I'm not going to try to fuck you after lunch.  I think it's your toad. 
[02:32:30]  It might be your toad.  I love you.  Oh, I've had enough, though.  You might want to tune this down a little bit.  If you're over 30, and you're single, there's a reason you're single.  Wow.  Because you're shit.  Jesus.  You fucking dopes.  You fucking flakes.  Oh, I don't know.  I got it.  Do you?  By the way, all babies supposedly are born with blue eyes.  That's coming today.  I know.  It's from Brazil eyes.  It comes in. 
[02:33:00]  They come in blue, and then around, they change.  I was hoping they stay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not for, he's going to be big, too.  He's from, her brothers are all six something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to hire some people.  My friends come over when I, I got to, hey, you're not going out tonight.  Yes, I am.  Well, apparently you are.  Me and Jim are just going to sit here.  Yeah, he's going to be a fake boy.  Jim, believe me, by the time he's going out, I'll still be in the same position.  Hey, you got any fucking friends at school that will have lunch with me? 
[02:33:30]  Hey, you know, you're going to meet somebody.  It's fucking, but literally, like, I've tried the respectful route.  I really have, dude.  What's the respectful route?  Meaning, you talk to him and his friends.  Don't send creepy text messages or dirty text messages.  Like, there's some girls I've dirty text with, but I mean, literally just being polite and being nice, it's, I'm telling you, from my own experience, either they Google me, but it's like, hey, dummy, you've had a real interaction with me.  Yeah, but you're going to meet somebody that likes you for the piece of shit that you are. 
[02:34:00]  But I'm not even saying I wouldn't be a piece of shit.  It's like a Hallmark card.  My wife blew me on a rock the first date.  Well, that's because you're in a foreign country.  But you know what I'm saying?  I got it.  The rock.  The rock.  Yes, we got it.  But, I mean, everybody's chick knows what piece of shit you are.  You can't pretend to be this honorable, hey, I'm not going to offend you.  You know what?  You're going to be you.  There's a good guy, Jimmy.  Jimmy's a nice guy.  Thank you. 
[02:34:30]  You are a nice guy.  He's very sweet.  There's a really good person somewhere in there.  Yeah, but so ain't I, so are you.  But he's got to be more of the piece of shit he is on this show.  No, no, no.  But guys, don't think that I'm giving that guy up.  I'm not saying, I don't know, I'm not being fake with these chicks and going, hey, we'll just hold hands and have a moth.  I'm not doing that.  I'm only saying, but I'm saying, let's just go to lunch.  Like, I'm not being creepy and I'm not denying who I am.  I'm not saying, don't Google me, it's all lies.  I'm only saying, let's go to lunch like a courtesy to get to know someone as a friend. 
[02:35:00]  Like, I'm not even being, I'm not saying, look, if she fucking shat, then I would make her white before coming over.  I'm not saying I'm changing who I am.  Well, thank God for that.  But you know what I mean, I'm not denying who I am or being fake.  The type of girl that likes you, there's got to be, I know.  They don't eat lunch?  The type of girls that like me don't ever get hungry?  They don't eat, yes.  Yeah, that's all he's looking for.  Yeah.  There's a nice meal and some conversation.  But the type of girls that like you, I don't know if this makes sense, but the girls that like me when I was single didn't live in Manhattan. 
[02:35:30]  They lived in Jersey.  That's true.  And Boston.  God damn.  And Long Island.  I used to have to go to Long Island on a train to get head.  Yeah.  Manhattan girls suck.  Yeah, Manhattan girls are.  New York City girls suck.  So it's like.  Yeah, you already got points taken away from you there.  So it's like, Jim, you're going to have to go outside of the city and meet a chick and go somewhere else.  Yeah.  And meet a square.  But if I have to do that after fuck, you know, it's like, oh.  It's not about getting laid. 
[02:36:00]  Getting pussies.  Like, literally, you know, it's not hard to get laid.  I know that.  You can always get your dick sucked.  There's guys everywhere.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, he has a dress on.  What the fuck?  Women with a little extra.  Right, of course.  But honestly.  Women with a little extra.  I'll do a circle jerk with you.  I haven't got fucking anything in months.  Oh, God.  It's just terrible.  I'm sinking it deep into that fucking mucus plug.  Oh, Jesus.  I'd never reach that.  Oh, poor Bobby.  Is the girl here yet?  No.  Yeah.  Is she?  She's not here yet. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, she is here?  We should tell you.  I think about the kid.  Like, if I ever had a child or something like that.  You'd be a great dad.  But I don't have that.  Like, I love when my brother's kid comes over, my sister's kid comes over.  It's like fun.  And even Travis's kid comes over.  It's fun to, you know, they go in the pool.  It's fun to watch kids have a good time and everything.  But I don't have that fucking parental instinct thing where it's like, oh, I kind of want that.  I don't either, dude.  I don't either.  But I'm telling you, dude.  And the other thing is, like, we're like you. 
[02:37:00]  I hate everyone else's kids.  Well, yeah.  I'm telling you.  But when you realize that you're a kid, it's hard to explain.  I told Bobby, just something gets turned on in your fucking brain.  It's weird.  It's fucking weird.  It's all cliche, dude.  It's all fucking cliche.  That's what I hear from everyone.  My own brother.  I know.  I've heard that.  Saturday, though, I was like, all right, Saturday.  Go to the fucking range.  Blast some fucking rifles and pistols.  And then there's a couple people there at the range that were like, they go to parties at my house.  So I was just like, you know what? 
[02:37:30]  Let's just have a fucking party at my house tonight.  All right.  Like, I love spur of the moment shit.  Well, you want to live like you're Jake in Once for Warriors.  But I mean, some fucking Jesus alone.  That's great.  Just having all the people in the bar come over.  Oh, my God.  I left the house this morning.  All I know, poor Ange.  Ange, sorry about the house.  There's a half of vanilla, like an ice cream cake that's just locked on my fucking island in the kitchen, just melting. 
[02:38:00]  It's like, oh, shit.  Beer, bottles, everywhere.  It's just a disaster.  Here's the thing, too.  You're loaded.  So having a kid for you.  He has money as well.  You could have done everything.  It's so much easier.  You could have done everything you just explained because you have money.  You could go, I got a nanny or a babysitter that obviously has to take care of my kid because I'm doing my thing.  You get a wife sometimes that fucking doesn't want you, you know.  Well, you got to pick the one.  Charlie, she had kids.  You can have kids. 
[02:38:30]  I understand.  You got to pick the right guy.  Then you're going to do the right thing by then.  You'll do the right thing.  It takes a lot of sacrifice from what I've seen to do the right thing.  You can have a kid and do whatever the fuck you want, and then they're going to grow up like fucking half the celebrity kids, all psychopaths.  As soon as the girl you're dating is able to have children, you should have.  Once that blood starts coming out.  I got to piss badly.  All right.  I've said it.  That would be a great fight.  You'd actually have a ball with it.  I would just start fucking, son of a bitch. 
[02:39:00]  Jesus Christ.  Don't get all pissy-eyed with me.  I'd be just like that.  Oh, look.  There's people out there.  Yay.  Hi, everyone.  Hi.  What's going on?  Are we being invaded by Amsterdam?  Amsterdam.  That is a handsome Aryan family out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  O.P. and Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break, and we'll be back shortly.  With Nolani Monroe.  Yes. 
[02:39:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Sorry.  I thought you guys would just come back.  We were bullshitting.  It was a fucking baby meeting down the hall.  Oh, boy.  We're going to the bathroom.  Bobby had a kid, obviously.  In the bathroom?  Yeah.  Terrible.  Our boss.  Our boss.  Give it to him.  Give it to him today.  Just for today. 
[02:40:30]  And Steve Blatter had a baby right around the time Bobby did.  So also we're talking about baby shit, and then he's turning me on to a great baby app.  The best.  We're a bunch of faggots.  Baby app.  Dude, he could like, it's kind of like your cameras.  Your cameras.  Yeah.  But he could pop a button, push a button, and then talk to his wife.  Whoa.  I used it the other day because she wasn't answering her cell phone.  I guess.  She wasn't answering her cell phone, so I hit that.  I go, pick up your, I go, use your phone and call me.  She goes, that's not what that's for. 
[02:41:00]  Hey, dude, are you talking about, are you talking about drop cam?  That's what Steve said.  No.  No, it's with baby.  It's not drop cam?  Oh.  It's a monitor.  I got drop cams around my house.  It's a baby monitor.  Drop cam.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Take a seat, honey.  Wow.  Wee.  Laney, how you been?  Hey, Laney.  How are you, too?  Yeah, whatever.  Hey, what's up?  Hang it out.  How are you?  Look at your big tits.  Oh, my God. 
[02:41:30]  You've got big tits.  Bobby hasn't had sex in two months.  I might have to go.  I feel very rapey right now.  Are you rapey?  Those are very nice implants.  Thank you.  Yeah, man.  Usually they're a horror show.  Those are nice.  They're super soft.  I don't have to wear a bra.  Right.  I like to get the titty sweat underneath.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  Damn.  You are on the air, so.  There you go.  Well, good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Why did you get into porn at 32? 
[02:42:00]  At 32.  Well, you know, I had a boyfriend for 12 years from 15 to 27.  Boom.  And then I took like a year off, and then I had another boyfriend for three years.  So it's like I never really got that wild college crazy experience.  So at 32, it was I'm single.  I'm in Miami.  Girls going wild.  Is that what college is about?  Double penetration?  Shit, right?  Good schools, yes.  Man.  I'm not ready for the DP yet.  Bobby, by the way, I'm looking at Bobby looking at you, and I haven't seen this look 
[02:42:30]  since Wild Kingdom.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You absolutely look like a guy.  I could cry right now.  He is tearing up.  He's very emotional.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you how dirty I could get right now.  You want a titty fucker, right?  No.  I want to literally bury my face in her bum.  Wow.  That's not my thing.  Well.  She's a lovely girl.  Why don't you take her to lunch?  That always works.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:43:00]  Would you like to go to lunch with Jimmy?  Will you go to lunch with Jimmy?  Yes.  I'm from Texas.  I can eat any time of the day.  Let's go.  Oh, yeah?  Texas girl?  Jimmy will take you to lunch today.  He has a great steak place.  He's being serious.  I have a tranny session.  Would you like to ask her out proper?  Someday, yes.  A tranny session?  No, no.  That's every day.  No, I have to go to the gym.  What?  Gym?  Walking out?  Eating better?  Daddy.  Do some sit-ups, Daddy.  No, it's more like, let me hold your legs back, Daddy.  You can pretend you're doing sit-ups, but you're really trying to push this out of you. 
[02:43:30]  I do lots of working out during bad sex.  Oh, during bad sex?  Yeah, when I'm, you know, missionary position, and I'm not enjoying it, I can get my crunches  in.  What constitutes bad sex?  If it's just boring, and I'm just not feeling, sometimes I'm just not into the guy, and I,  you know, I was at first, but then once he pulls it out, and he gets going, and he  And then I'll get in doggy style, and if it's horrible, he doesn't realize it, but I'm counting 
[02:44:00]  my push-ups.  Oh, then you're doing some push-ups.  He thinks you're just really into it.  Yeah.  You're like a Brazilian hooker that's staring at herself in the mirror, doing poses while  you're fucking her with all you got, and she's not even affecting her.  She's like, mm-mm-mm, and she's doing a photo shoot.  Jesus.  Nice.  Nice.  It's got to be disheartening.  I think older, you know, that you're in your 30s.  I'm 36.  There's so much sexier.  Yes.  There's so much sexier. 
[02:44:30]  I'm in my prime.  This is like when I'm really super horny, and once you get a little older, you're comfortable,  and you go for strange.  You want strange.  Oh, boy, do I like uncomfortable.  I like uncomfortable, and...  Yeah, and after sex, likes to have to sit a girl down.  And put his arm around her, and like dab away tears, and explain what's just happening.  Let's sing this song.  London Bridge is falling down.  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  So, less inhibitions, is that it?  Yeah, definitely.  You're not as inhibited with things, and...  Yeah.  Are you a MILF?  Well, I'm officially a MILF now, because I just got a little puppy, but I'm not...  A puppy?  Yes.  No kids.  Okay, no kids.  Well, that's good.  But I don't have any children, but I mean, you know...  There's no problem there.  I play one on TV.  You don't have any children?  No kids.  How many abortions?  Oh.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  That is a good question.  I have never been pregnant.  Never.  I'm very responsible.  Wow.  Is it responsible, or are you barren?  Can you move... 
[02:45:30]  Oh, come on, son!  Is your nickname down there Arizona?  Oh, she's dry.  Can you move the microphone?  I'm trying to get a cleavage shot for the Twitter.  That is nice.  Yeah.  Look at that, right?  Can I move the microphone?  Wow.  Oh, gosh.  No, no nips on Twitter.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Let's be good.  Well, fuck Twitter.  Yeah, fuck that.  Oh, Jesus.  You cut blocker.  You're moving them together too much.  Quickly.  All right, right there.  Oh, that's good.  You have great natural cleavage.  What does her areolas look like, though?  Beautiful.  I've never seen it.  You're a lovely girl.  I haven't seen an areola without milk coming out of it. 
[02:46:00]  I'm so sorry.  Bobby is horned up right now.  Bobby's a brand new dad.  Oh, congratulations.  He's very horned up seeing you here.  It's been a while, you know.  Did you have good pregnant sex?  Huh?  Did you have...  What do you mean, fuck my wife while there's a baby in her belly?  Oh, boy.  That's when the women are really horny.  We did that a couple of times.  Yeah, it was good, but it wasn't the best.  It must have been on your mind. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Bobby, what would you like to see?  It was a baby.  Bobby, what would you like to see next?  What would I like to see next?  This is all about you right now.  Yes.  What would you like to see?  What would you like to see?  Her clitoris?  Close?  Oh.  No, I'm kidding.  Well, she'll show you that.  Her breasts are beautiful.  All right.  But I can't get over her.  Is that your real butt?  Yeah, that's my booty.  Are you kidding me?  I'm from Texas.  That's crazy.  But this is what's crazy about it.  Your waist is so thin.  Thank you.  And your stomach is so flat, but your waist is so thin. 
[02:47:00]  And you're like an hourglass.  You're really...  Thank you.  I mean, your butt is crazy.  I'm trying.  She's lovely.  I'm in that Equinox every day.  That's good, because you're like an old-fashioned alarm clock.  It's the round.  Yo, what's your Twitter?  I should have said your grandfather clock.  That would have been good, too.  You're right.  Damn it.  Yo, what's your Twitter?  You should have said Big Ben.  My Twitter is Melanie Monroe, and Melanie has two L's.  All right.  Wow.  Tweet this shit.  So, do you have a boyfriend?  Oh, no.  No, huh?  No.  Now, you got into doing some of them adult features. 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  Let's say adult features.  Did you just dive right in?  Or did you kind of be like, I want girl on girl.  I want to do this first.  No, I really just...  It just happened.  I was managing...  I was corporate retail management.  I worked for Lacoste for many years, and so I was living in Miami, and it got a little  wild and crazy, and South Beach is a small community, so you just meet a lot of people,  so you meet girls in porn, and then you meet the owner of Bang Bros, and he's like,  oh, God, your ass.  You just don't understand.  And I'm like, you know what? 
[02:48:00]  Let's be wild and crazy and rebellious.  So I shot a Bang Bros scene.  Black guys?  It was some Spanish guys with Adriana Deville, that really pretty Italian girl.  Uh-huh.  So they broke me in in a foursome, my first scene.  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  You were all right.  She's lovely.  So were you on the rotisserie?  Were you like, you know...  It's like Boston Market.  One from the back, one from the front.  No, no.  I've been very vanilla.  Well, besides my wrestling at Kink and kind of letting them whip me sometimes.  Oh, Kink has some great stuff. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love Kink.  They're tied into some other sites, too, but they have some really hot domination scenes  at Kink.  Oh, wow.  They do a good role play over there, too, right?  Yeah.  Do you like role play?  The wrestling.  What's your role play fantasy?  Oh, I really enjoy, now that I'm older, I really enjoy the stepson scenes.  Whoa.  And I love the lesbian.  Bobby just lost his mind.  You like the stepson?  What about Chunky's stepson that doesn't fit in?  That works.  That works for me.  Chunky's stepson.  I'm adventurous. 
[02:49:00]  Let's do it.  Oh, why don't we do a little role play?  We're just going to lump in a basement.  We really could.  Bobby, why don't we do a little role play?  You two should improv a scene.  I can't.  I would never...  You're an actor.  You're an actor.  This is acting.  Improv a scene.  It's not going to be...  Bobby!  This is what will happen.  I'll go home and drag that baby and that woman out of my house.  And I'll fucking...  If she gives me her number, I'll call her.  I'll pay her whatever she needs to come over to my house.  Bobby, a little improv.  We can stop it at any time. 
[02:49:30]  At least start with your improv.  Bobby can do...  My second favorite thing is I like to get those really young girls that are new in porn.  And, you know, lesbian stuff was always a fantasy.  And I never really got to experience that.  Stepson is pretty good, though.  Jimmy, would you like to be a stepson?  But I'm good at teaching a girl scissors.  Jimmy should do stepson.  Jimmy should do stepson.  Jimmy's good at improv, too.  I don't know if Jim would do it.  Huh?  Oh, maybe...  I just want my son to see this 19 years from now.  I was fucking three weeks, Dad.  Three weeks.  Three weeks and this is what you were doing? 
[02:50:00]  And you're in a studio with those fucking assholes.  Oh, my God.  Brings over his new fucking black boyfriend for you to meet.  I'm glad they're both dead.  A little rebellious.  Oh, he's so rebellious.  Ha!  Mr. Kelly.  How would you start a stepson role play?  Very good question.  With a guy who was very shy.  Maybe...  Can I be the dad?  The great actor?  Can I be the dad that leaves?  Chip Chipperson?  You can be the dad that leaves.  I'll be the dad that leaves.  That's the extra that gets like 10 seconds.  Oh, good.  I'll be the dad that leaves. 
[02:50:30]  And I'll yell at my son.  Bobby, we want you to be stepson.  No, he looks like the stepson.  How about two stepson?  Maybe that makes it a little easier for you.  No.  Or sometimes I have my son's friend.  He comes over.  He's like, Miss Monroe.  What do you think?  Miss Monroe.  How about I'm your son.  That's my friend.  And I go, look, wait here, buddy.  And I'll be right back.  Wait with my mom.  And Ma, can you make him something to eat?  All right, let's do this.  Ready?  Okay.  Wait, but that's not a stepson thing.  No, but we're doing son's best friend, which is sexier.  Iraq, you got some light music in the background?  Way sexier.  Let's turn the lights down a little bit. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, is Iraq there?  No.  Let's get it cooking.  Make it sexy.  Get it cooking.  What the fudge?  Someone needs to yell action.  Yeah.  Action.  Oh, look, the lights are a little dimmer.  Wait with the music, fatty.  Action.  Now we need a little music.  Hang on.  Oh, boy.  Fuck, yeah.  All right, whatever.  This is very interesting porn on music.  It really is.  We don't want to go hack.  We don't want to go hack.  Iraq.  I appreciate the selection.  Maybe a little Beach Boys in the background.  Okay.  That's good for an opening scene of a porn. 
[02:51:30]  Yes.  Let's go different.  Aruba, Jamaica.  Don't you want to rape her?  I think the music is the irrelevant.  Yeah, yeah, the music isn't real.  All right, who starts?  Who starts in a second?  Me and Jimmy are walking to my house.  I mean, Chip.  Your name's Chip.  Chip.  That's his name for the thing.  Really?  All right.  That's a weird name.  Hey, dude, I've got to go to my house for a sec before we go to the game.  You cool with that, Chip?  What do you got to get from your house?  I've got to go to the bathroom.  Oh, look, you can go to the bathroom, but don't do what you did last time. 
[02:52:00]  All right?  I couldn't help it.  It clogged the toilet.  It ain't my fault.  All right, well, listen.  You can use the bathroom.  Use the one downstairs.  My mother calls me the double flusher.  I've got to double flush everything.  Your mother's such an asshole.  All right, listen.  We're going to go to my house.  My mom's home.  Don't be so fucking gawky this time, all right?  Can't help it.  She's really pretty.  I know she's pretty.  She makes my peck a jump.  Hey, hey.  Chip, it's my mom.  Remember she had to get me the plunger?  That was so embarrassing.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  I'll go to the plunger.  Listen, use the bathroom downstairs.  Yes, so let's just, we're going to go in.  Just be cool, all right?  Okay.  All right.  Ma, how come you don't have the keys to your own house?  I lost them.  It's a little, I lost them last week.  Why are you not coming?  I'm doing a backstory.  Yeah, why don't we just walk in?  It's a backstory.  I want to see your fucking house.  I want to see your mother.  She's wonderful.  Hey, Ma.  Hi, boys.  Hi, boys.  Hey, what's up, Ma?  Come on in.  I got Chip with me. 
[02:53:00]  Remember Chip?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He's such a cutie.  Hey, what's up, Miss Monroe?  Always a little nervous around me, though.  He is.  I ain't nervous.  I don't give a fuck.  Hey, I got to go.  I got to.  Oh, I forgot my books at school, Mom.  Okay, well, go get them, and I'm going to keep Chip here.  I need some help.  What about my fucking books?  I'll get your books, too, Chip.  I don't like my books.  School's for queers.  All right, listen.  But Chip, Miss Monroe needs help moving some boxes from the garage.  I hope they ain't heavy, though.  I hurt my fucking back, Miss Monroe.  Well, I'll give you a back massage if you need it after.  Okay, but careful. 
[02:53:30]  I got a cyst.  Jesus.  I like it so far.  I got a cyst.  I'm not feeling.  The backstory's good.  I'm not feeling this sexy yet.  For sure.  It's coming.  Give it time.  Listen to this music.  All right, well, come with me into the garage and remove your shirt so I can take a look  at the cyst while you're doing so.  Okay. 
[02:54:00]  I get embarrassed, though.  You're going to look at my body.  No, it's okay.  You're just such a little cutie.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  I got a port wine stain.  You look so nervous.  I am a little bit nervous.  My hands are sweating.  Okay, well, I'll just show you how to pick up the boxes.  You just kind of, like, bend over and pick it up, and make sure that you use your legs  and not your back.  Careful.  Your underpants are showing.  I love you.  I like to see it.  That little pink string you should have? 
[02:54:30]  That little bitty pink string?  Yeah, that's way too small.  My mother wears big underpants.  They cover her, and she's a very Ruben-esque woman.  I bet she's a sweetheart.  But you know, if I wear the big pants.  Yeah, she has big ankles.  She can lift a safe up the flight of steps.  She's very strong.  How do my ankles look?  You got very nice ankles.  Careful, your feet are hitting my pecker.  She got very nice ankles.  You like my ankles?  I do.  They're really nice.  Hey, your toes are blue. 
[02:55:00]  What are they, cold or something?  Fucking home run, Chipperson.  That's my sexy, hot, single MILF look.  What's a MILF?  A MILF?  Yeah.  That's a mother I'd like to fuck.  That's what you would do.  Oh, that's very crass.  I don't go for that talk.  No, you don't?  Can I see your feet without the shoes?  Hey, look, your shoes are made of wick.  What are they, chairs or something?  Oh, those are just some Louboutins.  What, Louboutin?  Who's Louboutin?  Nothing special.  Oh, is he friends with Frank Baton? 
[02:55:30]  Okay, take your shirt off.  Okay, take your shirt off.  It's time.  I don't want to.  I'm embarrassed.  I get a big port wine stain and a cyst, and I sweat, I perspire a lot.  Can I see your feet?  Yeah, you can see my feet.  I don't have a foot fetish or nothing, but my mother makes me rub her toes after a hard  day's work.  Oh, no.  Yeah, she said that sometimes Lamar holds them too tight, and they're really sore.  These may be a little bit more enjoyable for you.  Oh, these are very lovely toes.  Thank you. 
[02:56:00]  My mother makes me do the little piggy game on her.  Oh, no.  You should spend more time over here with my son, seriously.  Yeah.  He's cool though.  Sometimes we go into the basement, and he wants me to watch him tug his PETA.  One time behind a washing machine, he pulled down my pants and was rubbing his pecker on  my backside.  He said he was going to pop my cyst with his pecker, and he had me bent over.  I got tied all over my shirt.  You sound so stressed out, sweetheart.  Why don't you take down your blue jeans, and let's just do it on the boxes. 
[02:56:30]  Because I'm scared.  Don't be scared.  I got you.  I'll guide you through it all.  Oh, you want to see my you-know-what?  Yeah, I want to see the cysts.  I'll give a fuck.  I'll take it out.  The penis.  Let me see it all, sweetheart.  It's fucking big.  It is?  Yeah.  Fucking huge.  People tell me that fucking pecker should be in a museum or something, Chipper.  That feels so good.  Yeah, I'm rubbing your feet.  Is your penis getting hard?  No, I have erectile dysfunction.  Oh, no. 
[02:57:00]  Because sometimes I was taking medication for my anxiety, and it dries out my mouth and  gives me erectile dysfunction.  So sometimes I got to try to put it in soft.  I can do that.  Put my wet, juicy lips on it.  Oh, fuck.  I bet I'll cure that erectile dysfunction.  Fuck, yeah.  Yeah.  Get juicy, wet, like two fucking nice slugs crawling up and down my pecker stairs.  My panties are wet at this point.  Fuck, yeah.  I know that. 
[02:57:30]  People tell me I'm the cooter dampener.  I get a cooter so sloppy and wet it looks like someone threw a bucket of lard on it.  And the setup is over and cut to sex.  This is fucking hot, though.  We're getting there.  It's getting good, man.  We're getting there.  Mom.  Mom.  What are you guys doing?  Oh, you got to go upstairs, Miss Monroe.  He wants him and I to fool around a little bit.  Sometimes we play spin the bottle, and he makes me kiss him on the mouth, Miss Monroe.  Oh, Chip, that's not true.  I don't like that at all. 
[02:58:00]  Chip, it's not true.  I don't like kissing your son on the mouth.  I don't do that, Mom.  Hey, Chipper, let's practice kiss.  That's lies.  I'm going to leave.  I don't like.  I wish Dad was here.  We're going to have to have a talk.  I don't like practice kissing.  I'm rubbing her feet, though.  They're very nice feet.  I noticed the Chip character is really getting to rubbing your feet there.  Am I hurting your feet?  I know.  It feels incredible.  Yeah, my mother would make me rub her feet.  Sometimes she has big bunions.  She would say, look, Chip, on my sixth and seventh toe, I would kiss her bunions. 
[02:58:30]  You're so silly.  Oh, man.  I hope you don't talk when we start fucking.  Whoa.  No.  I talk with my pecker.  I just say, yeah, fucking pick that shit.  Let your pecker do the talking.  Fuck, yeah.  I give a good fuck.  Holy shit.  It's the face you're making.  It's great.  Yeah.  You should see me when I'm licking a cooter.  I'm down.  I'll look right up in your eyes.  Look at me. 
[02:59:00]  Look at me.  It's the sexy glances that works well.  The staring is going to really just make it awkward.  I could see your cleavage, though.  I didn't mean to look.  Can you see my titty sweat?  Yes, Miss Monroe, I can.  I was looking at that one time.  I was over here.  Remember one time when your son was...  I came over one time, and Bobby was sick.  Remember he was in the hospital?  He was really sick.  We thought he was going to die, and you was going to go see him.  And I said, why don't you stay here first and show me your you-know-whats. 
[02:59:30]  Don't tell all of our secrets.  This is fucking good, right?  You liking it?  Fuck, yeah.  Yeah, I bet you are.  Cocksucker went to market.  This motherfucker stayed home.  Oh.  She had a nice...  Now, you know, in a porno, at this point, it would be on in action time.  Yeah, yeah.  You'd have to fucking start fucking.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm rubbing her feet pretty good.  Yeah, it's good.  Yeah.  Should we get the ass involved, or what?  I already am. 
[03:00:00]  That is quite the ass.  That is quite the ass.  You should do the ass.  You should rub the butt.  I think I'm going to rub my butt on your penis.  Oh.  Oh.  Just kiss the toe.  Yeah, kiss the toe.  Nice.  Did you enjoy that cocoa butter lotion?  I fucking did.  Yeah.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  It smells like cocoa butter.  Yeah.  It's cocoa butter and a little bitter apple so my puppies don't bite my toes.  Does that stop dogs from biting your feet?  Oh, yeah.  I've got bitter apple all over my house.  You know what else would stop the dog from biting your foot? 
[03:00:30]  You kick him.  You foot.  Yeah.  Or you put milk on your pecker, chipper.  Oh, but that's not what you do.  Wow.  All right.  We've got to finish this.  Right in your lap.  Wow.  Let me get shit.  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  That hiney.  Right there.  Yeah.  Wow.  I've got to be honest.  It's really nice.  Yeah?  Wow.  Yeah.  You're digging that?  Yeah.  A lot of the movies.  Wow.  A lot of the movies focus on your butt there.  Yeah.  There's some movies where it's all about the ass. 
[03:01:00]  All about your ass.  Oh, is it going up?  No, I'm sitting off to the left.  You're sitting on your penis?  How big is this?  No, no, no.  That's 145 pounds on you, buddy.  I have to fix my penis.  It's not in you.  There we go.  Exactly.  No, no.  I zipped up the head and I got a scamp on it.  More romance.  I was in a rush.  We're going to double up the condoms on this one.  I was in the bathroom and a fire alarm went off.  So I zipped up the hole over my pecker by mistake. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, that'll hurt.  I had to go to a hospital.  Yeah.  What about my bum hole?  Are you going to do my bum hole?  Whoa.  Yeah.  I'm going to put my pecker in there.  Ass play.  No fear of dick in the ass, right?  For four years, I never did a bum hole scene.  And two weeks ago, I did my first one for Evil Angel.  Two weeks.  Oh, wow.  How was it?  Thank you.  Wow.  Who at Evil Angel?  Evil Angel is a company.  No, no.  I know.  But who at Evil Angel is a company?  Mike Adriano.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  Big dick? 
[03:02:00]  It was, yeah.  Yeah?  He's a very nice guy.  Oh, she's sexy.  How'd you take it?  Was it good?  Did you get it slow?  They gave me an anal training kit.  So it was like five.  What is that?  It's five rubber penises.  It's an application for here.  You know, your bum hole is a muscle, so you've got to stretch it out to get ready for this.  Was it like those Russian dolls?  Very similar, but more pointy.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  You can do the same thing with your mother's shampoo bottles.  Yes, you can.  Oh, shit. 
[03:02:30]  Or a hairbrush.  Chip, my hairbrush smells.  Have you been at it again?  Oh, no.  So you work it like small first.  So I practiced a little bit, but really I didn't.  I've only had maybe anal sex a few drunken times in my life.  Right, right.  I'm 36 years old.  Wow.  This was probably number five, and I just went for it.  I like this challenge.  That's what you make, two number twos and a one.  No, Chip.  I don't think she meant that.  So your asshole is crystal clean.  Oh, yeah.  It's not all beat up. 
[03:03:00]  That's what I'm saying.  She's wearing it.  I can't get a rod in front of people, but I probably could, but I can't.  It's probably fucking inconvenient when you're fucking.  Yeah, yeah.  How you can't get a rod?  Do you know how pathetic my dick feels right now?  Really?  Why?  She probably thinks it's awful.  I think he's precious.  Aw, isn't he?  Yeah.  So you get it in the ass on film.  Right.  And then did they capture some real live, like, holy fuck?  Because I know when I see a girl taking the ass on a movie, I'm kind of like, you know,  she looks like, oh, oh, but she probably has done this before. 
[03:03:30]  It was my first one, so they wanted to catch that nervousness and that initial intrigue.  And the initial one, he went in, and I screamed, and I go, I can't do it.  And I ran off, and I went to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Wow.  I took one of those, like, Melanie Monroe breathers, like, you can do this, girl.  You can do this.  And I went back out there, and I did the whole scene, 25 minutes.  Talked yourself back up.  Once it gets going, as long as the head doesn't come out, it's very enjoyable.  Oh, okay.  Were you afraid, though?  This is the thing.  I had an ex try to put a strap on in. 
[03:04:00]  This is true.  And I couldn't do it because it was like, I wanted to do it because it was so kinky and dirty.  Right.  But I couldn't do it because physically it just is too uncomfortable, and I kept feeling  like I was going to shit.  And it was like, I know, that was a, but that's true.  Like, I couldn't do it.  Until you get a baby to shit.  There's a whole process for anal.  It's graphic.  Oh, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, what do you, uh, what are they called?  Enema out and get, I get it, you just gotta clean out, right?  Yeah, all, the night before, you know, and then you don't eat, you don't eat the next  morning, then you pop the emodium, lock the system up, and you're ready. 
[03:04:30]  Emodium?  Oh, I never thought of that.  That's the problem.  Lock the system up.  I tried having a strap on.  You gotta lock that shit up.  Lock that.  I went to Chipotle first.  No, that's probably not the thing to do.  I did.  I had three coffees in a Chipotle.  It was like, the next thing you know, the lady was wiping off her thighs.  Oh, no.  But I liked it.  It was, I actually enjoyed it. 
[03:05:00]  You did?  I did.  So that was my first one for a company company.  And I'll probably just continue exclusively the rest of my anal life on my website.  So that'll be kind of something special.  Oh, that is special.  And it's, by the way, it says.  You got sponsorships.  MelanieMonroe.com.  Yes.  With two L's.  And you're going to be at the Exotica in Chicago, July 12th through 14th.  Yes.  And you're very fun.  That's why I love the penthouse girls at Lainey Briggs.  Because they're always got personality.  And they're like, they're fun people to talk to.  And they're honest.  Yes.  But so many of the girls we get in don't want to talk about anything. 
[03:05:30]  I know.  What?  It's annoying.  I hate those girls who just lay there.  I know.  They don't want to talk.  They don't want to take their clothes off.  I'll get naked here.  Don't test me.  Get naked.  Let's do it.  Don't do that.  Because the company policy doesn't allow for that.  Let's get naked over here.  Oh, you can't get naked anymore in here, right?  All right.  What the fuck?  Take your clothes off.  Fuck them.  She's getting naked.  She's getting naked in here.  She's getting naked.  You want it?  Why don't you get naked?  We would love to appreciate your body.  Do you want to see his beautiful brown nipples? 
[03:06:00]  Please.  Yes, I love them brown.  Wow.  Wow.  Wait.  Oh, Bobby.  Bobby, where are you going?  Bobby, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  He's got to check on his kid.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Where are you going, Bob?  Bobo.  I need a break.  He's taking a restroom break.  He really can't.  They look very, very real.  Thank you.  You can touch them.  I don't mind.  All right.  Well, there's a guy that wants to touch them outside, too.  Whoa.  Oh.  He's touching them properly right there.  They're nice and soft, right?  Wow.  They're really beautiful.  How do they feel good?  Do they feel normal? 
[03:06:30]  They feel perfectly.  They could be the best implants I've ever seen.  Wow.  You know what it is?  I used to be a big girl.  At 26, I had gotten up in a few years.  Bad relationship.  I'd gotten up to 224.  I lost 87 pounds.  Oh, my God.  I did.  And I kept it off.  But basically, I had those Discovery Channel empty sack hanging things.  Oh, okay.  So maybe that's why once they put the gummy bears in there, they...  Gummy bears?  Uh-huh.  Did you...  Do you shave everything?  Oh, yeah.  I haven't seen...  Let's get her naked, Bobby. 
[03:07:00]  I haven't seen my nuki hair in like...  That's been...  You shaved that off, right?  Yeah.  Not going old school.  It's Chippa making his little face.  You have no hair down there at all?  Bobby's eyes are going crazy.  Look at Bobby's eyes.  They're crazy.  You're a little fucked up right now, huh?  Well, look.  I love my wife and my child all the time.  I love...  He's just...  There's nothing better than what I have right now.  It's just I have...  I've been very...  I've been having very vivid sex dreams.  Can we see you naked?  This is here.  Bobby hasn't seen a girl naked in a while.  Yeah, we would love to. 
[03:07:30]  I've seen my wife naked.  It's just not the same.  But I mean, you know, a strange girl naked.  Yeah, give me some booty here.  Oh.  Some booty.  She has a...  Wow.  Are you fucking shitting me?  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a very lovely book.  That's your real ass?  That's my booty.  That's Texas...  Wow, mate.  Texas ass right there.  I need to shave it at all.  I grew up on cornbread.  You shaved the whole thing?  Oh, yeah.  I've shaved the whole thing for years and years and years.  Are they big or small?  Yeah.  Have you ever...  Can I ask you a question? 
[03:08:00]  Jimmy just wants...  Jimmy wants to see your pussy.  There you go.  Wait, wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, wow.  What is the pussy?  It's beautiful.  I have to see, too.  It's in the rules.  Bobby, it's in the rules.  What do you think, Bobby?  Yeah.  Imagine being down there, Bob, licking away.  Just going, lick, lick, lick.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick,  lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  I love that song.  How does it go again?  Lick, lick, lick, fucking lick, lick, lick.  That's what you say while you're doing it.  Will you say it while you're doing it? 
[03:08:30]  Look it right up in her eye.  Lick, lick, lick.  Fucking lick, lick, lick.  I don't think they...  Come bucket.  That's a hit song, I'm telling you.  Oh, yeah.  It would work, huh?  Lick, have you ever, can I ask you a question, have you ever just randomly met some dude  in a hotel or somewhere and just, not you and Chip, and ever just fucked him for shits  and giggles?  Never a stranger, always somebody that I know from meeting, like, somewhere like at a radio  show.  No, one night's dance.  We got that guy outside that wants to feel her up to her. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  This guy Edgar wants to take...  With your mind?  He's not supposed to because he works here in this video.  He's a maintenance guy here.  He's not supposed to do that shit.  Would you mind?  Of course.  No.  Come on in.  I'm a jungle gym ready.  I want to...  Can we blindfold you?  Sure.  Blindfold.  We want to blindfold you?  Plenty will watch out for you.  No one knows.  That sounds kinky.  You're blindfolding me so I don't know who it is.  Yeah, he's embarrassed.  Actually, he's an employee and he's, like, fucking fucked up.  You have to take your shirt off.  It's probably Who Kid or something. 
[03:09:30]  No, no, no.  Who Kid.  Who Kid.  Would you take your shirt off so we could take it?  He won't hurt you.  Who Kid highly recommended you.  Yeah, he's...  Yeah, he's awesome.  Yeah, we love the Who Kid.  Yeah, Who Kid's Instagram makes me feel shitty about my life.  Just hanging out with, like...  Everybody.  He gets some serious moisture.  Hot chicks.  Well, he's got...  He's fucking...  He's a shredded, talented, black guy with a huge cock.  He's funny.  Does he have a big penis?  I've never had sex with him.  Oh.  I enjoy that sexual tension. 
[03:10:00]  I'm telling you...  It's a good show.  When we're together, we're always just like...  I'm telling you, he has a big penis.  You can't?  I've had sex with him.  Oh.  My mother loves him.  I bet.  I don't know.  I'm in a big competition now with him.  Now that I've got the puppy, I'm just, like, total chick magnet.  And I'm very bisexual.  So I'm having those hot Asian girls that I like so much.  They're just...  Oh, this puppy's so cute.  Oh, you like being with another girl?  I do enjoy scissors, yes.  My mother said that's sinful.  She said, my Bible says Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, Chippa. 
[03:10:30]  Where's my blindfold?  I hate Chippa.  Oh, yeah.  Let's blindfold...  Is Chippa ruining the sexual vibe?  Yes, Chippa's destroying any sexual vibe that might be built up.  You wreck it.  I promise I won't.  You should take the headphones off.  You have to take your shirt off, or do you not want to take your shirt off?  Well, I'll just hang it out.  He can touch you.  Yeah, he can get around.  He can get all around.  All right.  Yeah, we'll run around.  He can get all around. 
[03:11:00]  That's okay.  Or she.  Yeah, that shirt is more like a...  That's a...  Make sure she's blindfolded.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  Stomach is amazing.  She's fantastic.  That's that Equinox.  Yeah, how'd you lose the weight?  Green juice and Equinox.  Is it Equinox or Equinox?  Go to the gym.  Whatever you want.  Go to the gym.  Eating better.  I don't want to call it.  Go to the gym.  Eating better.  Eating better.  Eating better.  I like my stomach fat.  I like my tickies big.  That is nice, man.  Thank you.  God damn.  Bring in Edgar. 
[03:11:30]  It's Edgar.  You can't look.  Can you look up and see?  I'm trying.  Stay right there.  She can see.  She's fine.  No, I really can't.  How many cocks are out in the room right now?  I have no idea.  Hey, all right.  How many cocks are out in the room right now?  Edgar.  What's up, Edgar?  Edgar.  There he is.  Edgar's wonderful.  We're just getting a microphone for Edgar.  What's up, Edgar?  Oh, my God.  There's a mic.  Edgar, slow down.  Okay, there's a man.  What are you doing?  Scratching her back?  Wait, I don't feel her. 
[03:12:00]  Edgar.  Are you squeezing that thickness?  Shut up.  Edgar's feeling the ass.  Edgar doesn't look like he's doing...  That sounds so funny.  Very sexy.  Oh, look.  The pants are coming down.  Holy doo-doo.  Oh.  What?  Yeah?  I like it.  Yeah?  Wow.  Edgar's feeling the ass there.  Can I touch Edgar?  Yeah.  No? 
[03:12:30]  No.  I can't back up on him?  I'm trying to see.  Let me see.  Oh.  There it is.  Let me see.  Oh.  Oh, Edgar's going to turn on.  Edgar.  Edgar, relax.  Edgar.  She's not a moralistic woman.  Edgar, why are you...  Why are you...  You're, like, scratching her.  Edgar.  Cup it.  Cup it.  How is Edgar's touch?  I mean, I'm going to have to teach him a little bit, but he's doing a good job so far.  Yeah?  He's talking fingernail. 
[03:13:00]  He's, like...  He's manicured.  But they're sharp.  They're, like, sharp little baby nails.  She's got small breasts.  What?  These are small breasts.  Oh, he said April Fools.  He said April Fools.  Yeah.  That's his thing around the office.  April Fools, as he says.  April Fools, right.  Oh, wow.  Edgar.  You're so sweet, Edgar.  Edgar's...  Edgar's licking.  Edgar.  How's he doing?  Like I'm a little puppy. 
[03:13:30]  Getting worked up, Edgar.  No.  Get away from me.  Get away from me.  How?  No, I'm...  Edgar's ticklish.  Are you ticklish?  No, I'm...  Where did you go?  I'm here.  Oh.  Now I'm going to try to cheat and see.  Oh.  I think Edgar's a little ticklish.  She's looking at me.  Stop looking at me.  She's tickling Edgar all over.  Quit tickling me.  A lot of me tickled.  Yes, I am. 
[03:14:00]  I go to the gymnasium.  No, you don't.  I'm totally trying to cheat and I can't sit.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  That's a good blindfold, right?  No, I didn't know.  Smash over the head.  Wouldn't even know.  Put you in my gun closet.  Yeah.  The weekend.  I like A cups.  Were you like A cups?  April Falls.  Oh, April Falls.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  April Falls.  You don't want this.  I see. 
[03:14:30]  April Falls.  Don't worry, babe.  I'll bring you something you like.  I got a lot of hot chicks.  Katie.  You can take the blindfold off.  That's wonderful.  That was Edgar.  Oh!  That's so good.  She didn't know.  I didn't think she...  Oh, I didn't know she didn't know.  I had it, yeah.  Yeah, I had it.  Of course.  Love that.  It's like, of course.  Looks like you two have to do lunch.  Yeah, you guys should do lunch.  You should do lunch.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  That's right.  Lunch is good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe have a little lunch.  Ah.  Lunch.  That's what you do.  You say regular things in a sexual kind of a tone.  You want to maybe get a little hummus?  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  Eating pussy sock again, Chip?  Yeah.  Hold on.  We got to get this on film.  It's fucking...  You get down there.  Wait, wait, hang on.  You open up that fucking cooter.  You take your nails.  Take your nails.  Hang on.  You got to dig your fingernails into the lips and you open them.  And you wrap your nails in them so they can't come out. 
[03:15:30]  And you just fucking stop going.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Fuck, lick, fucking lick, lick, lick.  You do that until she fucking comes all over her leg.  How does it go?  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Fucking lick, lick.  Fucking lick.  Fucking lick.  And then her fucking cooter gets so wet that you could fucking whatever.  Put a slip and slide on it.  Oh, slip and slide.  I'm telling you, you throw this over a beat, it's a hit song.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Very good.  Good to know.  Fantastic.  Melanie Monroe is a trooper.  She's fantastic.  And now, she wants to come on the bus trip possibly with us. 
[03:16:00]  Oh.  We apply on one of the stops.  Oh, heck yeah.  Yeah, you should go.  It's going to be fun.  Oh, gosh.  That's the vibe we need from the girls.  Fun.  Excellent.  Where are you going on the bus?  Everywhere.  Yeah, we have like five stops.  Down south a little bit.  That's where I'm from.  Then we're actually going to end up in Austin, Texas.  I love Austin, Texas.  We're going to be on the best.  We're going to be on the Titty Mountain Highway.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  We've got to get out and take those little bicycle girls.  They're hot. 
[03:16:30]  Bicycle girls?  Yeah, you don't take taxis in downtown Austin.  They have it in San Diego, too.  Same thing where they ride around.  And you just ride in the back.  And they're always dressed in superhero costumes.  Are they hookers or no?  No, they're totally not.  Damn it.  I had a girl one time.  I was in San Diego at Comic-Con.  Do you remember, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  There was a girl on one of those bikes, and she was stopped.  And she's standing there with her foot propped up, and she was wearing little shorts.  And I could see one of her lips.  That's dope.  And I'm fucking talking to her.  And I know she saw it.  And I just gave her 20 and kept talking to her.  And she just stood there. 
[03:17:00]  It's one of the most turned on I've ever been.  Wow.  So you think she stayed like that because you slipped out of the 20?  Absolutely.  You think so?  You remember that moment.  But you can see it, right?  And what were you just staring down at her?  I literally...  It was almost like that someone stole her head.  If she was Ichabod Crane, and I was just chatting with her vagina, because she was showing  it to me.  Right, right.  Holy fuck, man.  Those girls are hot.  So that's a nice thing about Austin.  Those are the food trucks.  Oh, yeah.  I love Austin.  I've only been there a couple times, but it's a really fun city. 
[03:17:30]  I can't wait to hang out there.  I just kind of go...  Because you go in for the thing, and you're in and out.  Oh, I can't wait to go.  This is going to be a good time, definitely.  I guess we have to plug everything.  Yes.  I definitely want to plug the great Melody.  We have to plug everything.  Melanie, thanks so much.  Thank you.  No, no, I didn't...  No, no, no.  Chip.  I didn't mean that to be crap.  No, I know.  It's just a...  Fucking Chip could suck the sexuality out of the room.  Did Chip ruin the sexuality?  Oh, God.  No. 
[03:18:00]  My panties are still wet, so we're good.  He brought it back with a fucklit lip song.  Oh, no, you should probably be careful, because you're going to get chased.  My mother one time had her thighs and vagina chased.  That would be horrible.  She's incontinent.  A lot of times, she'll wet herself on the bus.  See?  Just like this.  Like the end of Midnight Cowboy.  Well, that's what happens to me in the summertime if I wear...  I like to wear tights or pants, because they're little short shorts.  My thighs, they're very thick and round, like turkey legs, and they rub together in  the summer, and they get red, and yeah, it just gets like a little... 
[03:18:30]  You've got to put salve on them.  Salve.  My mother would have me rub salve on her thighs.  Talking about his mother and salve.  Chip, my thighs are raw.  Whatever turns you on, baby.  Supposed to be.  I was doing it because she's a very good woman.  Why don't you stop talking about your mother, you guys?  I know, she's an asshole.  You've got a beautiful girl here.  Melanie Monroe is very lovely.  Talk to her all nicely and, you know.  Talk to her, Chip.  She's right there.  You're very beautiful.  Oh, see?  That's nice.  Hold her hand.  That's good, Chip. 
[03:19:00]  Hold her hand, Chip.  No, hold her hand.  Not your finger.  You fucking alien.  I'm holding her fucking hand.  What the fuck?  Like he's guiding someone across the street.  It's the worst.  It's really terrible.  Oh, she's rubbing your hand.  Yeah, she's petting my hand like it's a small giraffe or something.  Humor's good, too, Chip.  You're doing good.  That's a good one, Chip.  Yeah.  Now, don't screw up this sexual vibe you've got going now.  His palms are sweaty.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My palms are wet like I've been fucking, like I've been juggling with wet avocados or something. 
[03:19:30]  Stop.  Don't try that.  Now, compliment her.  Talk to her nicely.  Yeah.  You've got fucking great hair.  Thank you.  I love my little bob haircut and my bangs.  Who's bob?  Cracking himself up again.  That's actually my dad's name.  Oh, cool.  Oh, no.  My mother's name is Dolores.  Nothing about your mom.  Don't bring your mother up, Chip.  Don't bring your mother up.  It's not sexy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Talk to her about, like, how sexy her.  My mother's hot.  She runs marathons.  How old is she?  She's 58, but she's banging. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I fuck her.  No, Chip.  Chip.  Talk to her about how sexy her body is.  Yeah.  Talk to her about her lips.  Your body is fucking so hot that I would fucking tear it up.  Thank you.  Talk to her about her lips, Chip.  How sexy her lips.  How you like to kiss them.  Yeah, I'd love to fucking smooch with you till the cows come home.  I'd fucking lay in bed and just fucking smooch with you while the TV's on.  He's growing on me.  He's growing on me.  Yeah, I'd fucking stick my tongue down your throat so far that it would come out your fucking, 
[03:20:30]  your cooter.  My cooter?  I think, once again, you're kind of blowing the whole vibe here, Chip.  You should give her a kiss on the cheek, Chip.  So, what's allowed on the bus?  Is there sex on the bus?  Oh, yeah.  Shenanigans and hijackers.  I just have one rule.  No number twos on the bus, and we're good.  Yeah, fuck that.  You mean blacks, right?  You silly goose. 
[03:21:00]  Holy shit, Chip.  You silly goose.  Oh, my God.  Melanie's fun.  Melanie rules.  Thank you, Melanie.  It was Melanie Monroe on Twitter, and it's M-O-N-R-O-E.  And it's two L's, too, in the Melanie part.  I tweeted, how about we spell the whole thing?  M-E-L-L-A-N-I-E-M-O-N-R-O-E.  And, yes, Melanie will come on the bus with us, and she'll be exotic in Chicago in July 12th through 14th.  What a fun personality.  Awesome.  Thank you.  I love my job. 
[03:21:30]  I'm having so much fun.  This is my sexual peak.  My website's really cool because it's very interactive.  It's the only place where, when you join, you can actually private message me.  You can tell me what kind of porn you want me to make for you because I get to create whatever I want.  Yeah.  And I'm on their live webcam all the time, and if you remember, it's free.  Damn.  I mean, it's a good deal.  You fucking jack off while you're watching.  Yeah, you pump your pita until you fucking shoot it all over the top of your flip-flops.  And your mother goes, what happened? 
[03:22:00]  It's a silly.  Ah, Chipper.  So, yeah, go to her website.  Go to MelanieMonroe.com.  It's nice to see.  Someone like you, it'd probably be very fun to interact with live like that.  You can tell she's a real pervert.  She's not fake.  Thank you.  You can tolerate a lot of silliness.  I'm nasty.  I'm pretty nasty.  I was pent up.  I had one boyfriend that I was faithful to 12 years ago.  Damn.  Was he shredded?  I'm getting it all in.  Like a UFC fighter?  No.  Did he have a big penis?  No.  Wow.  Did he hunt fucking possum? 
[03:22:30]  And it was from, wow.  He was a DJ.  He was way more into that than anything else.  But, you know.  Don Johnson?  No.  He was just thin.  He would never.  I would never get to finish.  He was a damn Joe.  My mother always said, Chip, I'll do a kike burger, so take all your pennies.  Jesus Christ.  Chip.  You never got to finish?  I never got to finish.  So, once we would do our little two minute thing, he would go and take a shower, and  I would sneak into the walk-in closet, shut the door, hold my breath, and wait and make 
[03:23:00]  sure he didn't come out, and I would masturbate and finish off.  That's pretty hot.  So, now I'm super sexual.  It's like, whew.  Damn.  What would he just fucking blah, blah, blah.  What would he sing when he was in the shower?  I don't know.  He would lock the door.  Fuck, lick, lick, fuck, lick, lick, lick, fuck, lick, lick, fuck, lick, lick, fuck, lick.  Wow.  Yeah.  I make a girl cum so many times, she don't want to do nothing but fucking cum again.  I mean, I got that same thing that I do get sometimes. 
[03:23:30]  You know, for 12 years, I got that, oh, you're just so sexy, I couldn't hold it.  Okay.  Yeah.  I have to say that sometimes, too, and it's like, then I got to take my pants off and have  them washed.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One time I came while I was high-fiving a girl.  That's happened to me before.  I was the coach of the soccer team.  Are you a size queen?  What do you mean?  Not you.  I'm actually, I have a, because I do so many squats in the gym, I get that, you know, my 
[03:24:00]  pussy muscle gets, you know, I do, I'm nasty, I can't help it.  So I do a lot of kegels when I'm doing all those squats and all the kickboxing, so it's  really, really tight.  So the big ones, I'd rather a regular-sized penis, in all honesty.  I want a regular-sized penis because I can sit on it all the way, the Chex's cowgirl.  Hang on one second, what's a regular?  Fucking 15 inches, right, Bob?  Wink.  Six, six, seven.  Yeah, that's how wide the head is on mine. 
[03:24:30]  I mean, that's average, right?  One potato, two potato, three potato?  I can fold a pillow in half, ride it, and cum, so penis size really doesn't matter.  I don't sleep too long, I got apnea.  I'll put you to sleep.  As long as she's talking about chip.  He's trying to relate to the conversation, but he's singing.  He'd sit on his face with that ass to help us sleep apnea.  Right?  No, I couldn't breathe that way, Bob.  Oh, yeah, you would stop breathing.  Yeah.  Michael, get off me.  I can't breathe on that one.  That's my point.  Yeah, a girl put a butt on my face one time. 
[03:25:00]  She's like, go ahead, Chippa.  What happened?  I keep your face.  You gotta get your butt hole over my face.  I feel like there's a bunch of raccoon dancing on my face or something.  He fucking hated it.  He just doesn't understand.  My fucking head hurts right now.  My fucking head hurts.  Chippa.  Yeah.  I put my finger in a girl's butt, and she tightened up and dragged me around the room.  He was cracking up.  He really dragged me over to a coffee table. 
[03:25:30]  He really took all the sexuality out of it.  I'm fine now.  Everything.  It's impossible.  I just want to go home to my baby and my wife.  Oh, my God.  You just start getting into a conversation.  Go ahead.  I ain't trying to fucking in a theater.  Say what you want.  I'm just trying to help.  You're going to get into a horrible conversation.  No, you're hilarious.  I'm loving it.  I'm trying to help out.  No.  Yeah.  Maybe Melanie has a question for Chip.  Or any of the guys.  I don't want to tell you about me.  Yeah, Melanie, what do you got?  What do you want to ask?  Are you single or married?  There you go.  That's a very good question.  Fuck yeah.  What does that mean? 
[03:26:00]  Either or Chip.  Which one?  Which one?  Oh, she didn't specify.  She did.  I'm single.  You're single?  Love to mingle.  Oh, no.  I'm the same way.  I am very single, too.  I eat pringles.  Horrible line.  Maybe ask him what he likes to do on a date, Melanie.  I know you like to go to eat.  Fuck yeah.  Cuda.  What else do you like to do?  Fuck.  Me too.  Stick it in fucking deep.  As a single man, how many times a week are you having sex? 
[03:26:30]  Hundreds.  You beat me.  Fuck yeah.  You beat me.  I'm a compulsive liar.  Go ahead.  When I'm home in New York, I rarely date.  It's very rare.  I wish I could date more.  I'd like to.  You live in New York?  You live in New York?  I do live here.  Look at that.  I live right down the street.  Wow.  Yeah, me too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We probably live in the same building.  I live in the Trump house.  Oh, nice.  Oh, I'm not that fancy.  On the 30th Avenue. 
[03:27:00]  Okay.  Could you imagine being neighbors with her?  Fuck yeah.  I'd drill a hole in that wall.  What, yeah?  Quicker than you can fuck it.  There's a very famous porn star in my building as well.  Really?  Yes.  Watch it take.  Jesus.  Me and Brittany Andrews are neighbors.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Must be a party at the old garbage chute.  Wow.  Wow.  It's crazy over there.  I can't wait to see her come downstairs sometimes just to see the outfit she's got on because  she's DJing now, so it's awesome.  She dresses very provocatively. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hot pink fishnets.  Patent leather boots.  She'll come in the lobby like that.  Yeah.  I'll pat some leather boots.  No fear.  Get it?  Chip.  But I'm in love with my Hitachi.  It plugs in the wall.  Who's he?  A Japanese fella?  Yeah.  He's my magic wand.  He helps with my abs because I'm totally crunching for an hour.  I can get 10 in with that Hitachi.  Wow.  I can get 10.  I was watching a lot of woman masturbation fucking squirt videos last night. 
[03:28:00]  I got on this fucking thing.  What's with these fucking videos where it's like this virtual reality monster fucking these  chicks now?  Who's getting off on that garbage?  I love that stuff.  No, it's so stupid.  It looks like a battering ram.  It's like video game looking monsters and they superimpose them like they're fucking  chicks.  Oh, wow.  It's so silly.  You never played a girl on like Call of Duty and you and her, instead of fighting in the  belly, you snuck off to a hut and she just crouched down and went back and forth, back and 
[03:28:30]  forth, back and forth, and said, you like that?  You fucking...  No, it never happened.  It's pretty hot.  It's pretty hot.  It's pretty hot.  It never happened.  That's why they invented that other stuff for him.  I was watching that.  I saw some girl in a video.  She was masturbating and she had to be real quiet.  She's in her room and then she took her hairbrush and started going off.  Jesus.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Nice.  Yeah.  If I can hear my neighbors are home, I have to sometimes turn on my hair dryer and they'll  keep the water running in the shower just for extra noise.  You use a hair dryer? 
[03:29:00]  No.  I've used a hairbrush in my backside before.  I get on my hands and knees and I move it back and forth like I'm trying to jimmy the  coin slot in the washing machine.  Okay, our first date, you're going to get waxed.  No, I don't.  My hair's a natural and wild.  Natural juices and berries.  Show her the arm hair, Chip.  No, I have very wispy arms.  Oh, it's jimmy.  It does.  Jimmy, how you doing?  It's really weird.  Just pet it. 
[03:29:30]  It's very ticklish.  There's no hair there.  I know.  He is a hairless.  Do you shave it?  No, I only shave my face and my dick.  I don't shave my stomach, my legs, anything.  He's got no hair.  Balls are good.  Yeah, you know, I don't really need to shave my balls.  I do, but they're very...  I'm Irish, so I'm very not too hairless.  Nice.  It's so funny.  I never knew you were Irish.  Yeah.  I never asked you what you were.  Norton, Irish Jimmy.  Irish Jimmy.  I never knew.  It comes out of the jam.  It comes out of the jam.  Yeah, it's obvious when I talk to Ozzy.  Yes.  I'm a Protestant in fucking... 
[03:30:00]  Corporate accent.  Belfast.  Go to the...  Jim, we're eating a little better.  My name's Jimmy Norton.  Eating better.  Yeah.  Fucking skipping to the low of something.  I get a shillelie.  Eating better.  My crooked shillelie.  Hi.  So, let me ask you...  You're so silly.  Oh, I know.  Bobby, where are you going to be?  What gig do you have?  I just love somebody.  I think he's going to be on the Travel Channel tonight.  We didn't talk about it at all.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, but...  Oh, really?  Well, I'll talk about it, because I want to fucking... 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, we didn't talk about it at all, but Bobby's got a show on the Travel Channel tonight.  Nice.  Yeah.  What time?  Just because I want to know.  It's, uh...  Well...  I want to see my pal.  9.30.  9.30.  Why can't you talk about it?  They don't want me to...  They don't want me to...  They want a cold watch.  They want to see who would watch it without promotion.  Oh, without any...  Well, I didn't know that, but...  All right.  9.30 tonight at the Travel Channel.  I'm going to check it out.  And then I'm at Foxwoods this weekend.  Foxwoods.  Doing a YK...  You know what, dude?  Podcast show all weekend at the casino. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, nice.  Oh, cool.  He does a very good podcast, Melanie.  Yeah.  I have one of those.  I'd love to have you on.  Will you be on?  Are you actually performing there?  Yeah.  I'm doing a show Thursday, Friday.  One Thursday, one Friday, two Saturday.  I'm doing a nasty show late Saturday.  So it's like a few people on the show.  Who's on it?  Some nasty people.  I'll come right up and do some fucking hilarious stuff.  Would I love Chip to do a fucking set?  I'll come right up there.  Fucking peckers!  You think that'll get the crowd right away? 
[03:31:30]  Fuck yeah!  You just yell fucking peckers at the crowd?  Yeah, suck it, everybody!  Fucking suck peckers!  I'm just going to spit hot coffee on her tits.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I'm probably going to like it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Chip knows how to grab that crowd right from the start.  Fuck yeah, he'll be great.  I don't see nothing.  Walk out.  Yeah.  What do you want the emcee to say to bring you up?  This is the funniest guy in the world.  He's fucking...  Usually does the garden, but he's here tonight.  He makes millions of dollars. 
[03:32:00]  Those are all lies.  And what's your second joke?  I just go like, fucking pecker!  Because they fucking cheer.  If you don't get a girl to suck your pecker so good, that her fucking hair falls out or  something.  Why would her hair fall out?  She's getting like chemo.  That's not even funny!  That's horrible, Chip!  That's horrible!  Why would you do that?  Why would you have sex with a girl who's doing chemo?  Because she's on a bed laying there, and you're like, you don't look too busy.  You pop this giant fucking pecker into your open mouth. 
[03:32:30]  Holy fuck!  They're all horrible!  That's horrible!  It's not even funny!  I don't even know what the fuck is.  It really is not funny.  Oh my gosh, Chip, huh?  What the fuck?  You ever see a comic, Chip?  Yeah!  You go up there, it's a rapport with the audience, it's a joke?  Yeah, that was a joke, I wouldn't really do that.  No, it wasn't really a joke.  Fuck yeah, it was.  So that's all you do is just...  How do you leave the stage? 
[03:33:00]  What's your closer?  Whatever, I'll say something like, you guys been great, and I've been Chipper.  I'll fucking clap my hands and drop the mic, and just let them stand.  You know, Ben, I want to see this.  I know, it sells the mic.  This doesn't happen in the near future.  You guys are all assholes.  Fucking brilliant.  On Saturday, July 20th, we added our show to the Sands Casino anti-social show.  The first one is sold out.  This is a 10 p.m. show with myself, Attell, Amy Schumer, and Artie Lang. 
[03:33:30]  Jesus, what a fucking show.  Yeah, I know tickets are selling very well.  Do you guys have like a poster or a t-shirt for that?  It's a billboard.  I don't know, we have a billboard outside of Lincoln, but I should do a t-shirt.  Like, I mean, how great would that?  I'd love to have a shirt.  You know what I mean?  Remember the old concerts with the wrist on the back?  Yep.  Yeah, we should do that one.  That would be great.  We haven't done enough dates in a row to make the list.  You're not going to be able to see, you don't get to see that many comics like that.  That's all the headlines.  That's good, too, yep.  Right on, brother.  Who follows who?  I host, the way we've done it is I've hosted it, then it was Amy, then it was Dave, then 
[03:34:00]  it was Artie.  We had, when the first year was myself hosting, Bill, and then Jim Brewer, and then Dave.  You know, it varies.  I host it, so it's, you know, my easiest gig.  And then we all go out together at the end and just fucking riff for like 10 minutes.  That's fun.  That's my favorite part.  That's awesome.  I just go out there and steal a fucking show.  I see you in like a black latex onesie.  Fuck yeah!  I see you like in this F&M outfit one time.  No, I wear a leather vest on stage when I do jokes. 
[03:34:30]  A leather vest?  Yeah, with a fucking studded gloves.  I come right out with my thumbs up.  What's up, fuckers?  That's what I'm picturing.  What kind of buttons on the vest?  No buttons.  Why button it when you show what you got?  Fuck, get the chips wet.  Yeah?  All the guys want a beer.  I would definitely see that, though.  I would.  I would chip on stage?  Ridiculous.  On a nasty show?  You know how quickly it would get old, though?  Oh, you don't know.  You'd just be sitting there going like, yeah, peckers, and then you'd just start going like, right. 
[03:35:00]  I tell you, that's the beauty of Chip, is he always disappoints.  Yes.  Like, whenever there's a video, like, go ahead, be Chip.  It's like, huh?  He just panics.  He's like, don't you fucking know what we want?  He's not the anti-hero who wins in the end.  No.  He's a fucking zero.  You've got to have him do, like, seven minutes before Jim Norton.  Jim Norton probably couldn't follow seven minutes before Jim Norton.  But you come out with a fucking wig and the whole thing, man.  Jim Norton sometimes does Chip towards the end. 
[03:35:30]  It's very fun to me to watch when they get sick of it.  They start getting tired of him.  They should do Chip on that bus thing you guys are doing.  Chip, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Chip will be joining us on the bus, I'm sure.  Chip will be joining you.  You'd be lucky if you see Jim for five minutes on that stupid trip.  It's going to be all Chip and fucking Edgar and fucking Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  He really did create other people who doesn't have to deal with you guys.  So he doesn't have to fucking...  Do you know how great it is that Jim can stay in New York while fucking Chip goes on  the bus trip? 
[03:36:00]  But Melanie was very fun.  Absolutely.  You really took it to a weird show, but you were very fun.  We loved you, man.  Yeah, she was fun.  We've got to say it because Lainey knows.  Yeah.  It's hit or miss.  You know, Lainey was a fucking home run.  You know, Lainey, somebody's fucking bitches you bring in here.  We've had him run out crying.  Are you serious?  And we're not even doing anything that bad.  Cutting farts.  I mean, don't...  I mean, us.  Melanie was great.  Melanie Monroe on Twitter.  Very beautiful.  Yes, absolutely.  Come back and see her.  It was fun and sexy. 
[03:36:30]  All right.  And she would have been very sexy behaviorally if Chip hadn't spoiled everything.  Oh, no, man.  You went with it.  I enjoyed Chip.  I actually did.  Sexual kryptonite.  Next time we'll do something different.  That worked, man.  That was hilarious.  Fucking whatev.  Whatev.  I want to see that porno.  Yeah, me too.  Really do.  I just want to see that.  Chip sticks it in.  You know, fucking awesome.  But did you see a hilarious, like a funny porno?  Just some character.  Fucking railing.  Fuck lick, lick, fuck lick, fuck lick, fuck lick.  Holding her fucking hips.  Going, go ahead.  Come again.  I ain't doing nothing. 
[03:37:00]  I'm game.  We're taking you down.  We're going to get you tested.  And you're a porno star.  Get tested for what?  For the AIDS.  For cooties.  Chippy cooties.  I don't got no fucking AIDS.  Chipper cooties.  I like chipper cooties.  Chipper cooties.  All right, we got to go.  All right, guys.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Melody.  Thank you, Bobby.  Thanks, man.  Bobby, good to see you, Bobby.  I'm a little child.  Yes, nice.  Very sweet.  Can I bring him over to the pool?  Yes.  Yes.  Believe me.  Anytime.  Bring him over to a pool party.  Yes.  Have you brought your kids over to the pool yet? 
[03:37:30]  No.  I haven't been over to Anson in a little bit.  We should do it all kids day.  I agree.  No, Paul doesn't go.  That's every Saturday night party.  I was going to say a regular fucking day.  We're just throwing a few babies in there.  I mean, kid kids.  I got you.  You're non-fuckable kids.  I'll bring my puppy.  I'll bring my puppy for the kids.  And I'll wear a onesie.  I'll wear a one piece.  Oh, a onesie.  Nice.  I would not be able to.  Those old school one pieces.  One piece?  Yeah, I'll do it for the kids.  That's actually hotter to me. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Hotter.  We should have a pool party day.  Hotter.  With your brother and the kids.  You and the kids.  Me and the kids.  Absolutely.  Let's plan it.  Jimmy comes out.  Yeah, I entertain them.  I tell them a little long jokes.  Travis, of course.  Travis, Lisa, and Riley.  Yeah.  I'm in charge of children's activities.  Oh, we'll have you in a lifeguard chair.  Naked.  Yeah, have her in a lifeguard chair.  Have me sneaking in the pool house with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, give me some mouth-to-mouth wink.  Again. 
[03:38:30]  Fucking.  I guess we'll see you in an hour then.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  On Demand.  On Demand.  After 1-A-Live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[03:39:00]  This is After 1-A-Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Make it red.  Oh, they're red, Bobby.  Make it red.  Oh, they're red.  Make it red.  Make it red.  Opie and Anthony live.  The Bob and Sam show.  Bob and Sam show.  Sam, Bob, and who kid?  Without who kid?  I miss who kid.  I miss him every day of my life that I don't see him.  Really?  Are you a little calmed down now?  You're very horned up.  Hey, dude, you know what?  Look, here's the reality of it. 
[03:39:30]  I love my wife.  I love my life.  I love my kid.  Right, but...  My sex is not a thing that it used to be.  Did you just say my sex?  My sex.  My sex is not happening like it used to be.  My sex is just...  It's not around anymore.  It's not, it's not, you know, there's certain sacrifices you have to make later in life.  For instance, my sex.  My sex.  And I feel weird talking about with these little hot interns walking around.  And they're just kind of...  Smoking dirty elves. 
[03:40:00]  They're just looking at you but not looking at you.  Who hired them?  Nagel.  Thank God for Nagel.  You've been hiring creeps for fucking five years.  You finally hired some nice girls with...  Who want to...  Look at them work.  No, they're not.  They're working at the same rate as any other intern we've ever had.  Except we've never paid attention to any other intern we've ever had.  They both look...  I like the hoodie outfit she's got.  I like the summer dress that she's got on.  No, that's Jackie with the summer dress on. 
[03:40:30]  I like Jackie.  It's a great name.  Oh, shit.  Hi, ladies.  They just laugh.  They don't even acknowledge that you're saying hi.  Fuck, yeah.  They're both into me, but I'm like, it's not appropriate.  Nobody likes you, Chip.  Nobody likes you.  No guys think that you're cool.  No girls.  They were emailing me and going,  Hey, Chip, maybe we could go out for a drink or perhaps a fucking Waldorf salad.  Did they say fucking Waldorf salad?  I was like, why don't you talk like a lady?  You don't even know what a Waldorf salad is. 
[03:41:00]  Yes, I do.  What is it?  It's a fucking salad with a bunch of Waldorf's on it.  Cocksucker.  Home run, Chippersna.  I got to give that one to you.  I got to give that one to you.  Oh, yeah.  What do you got going on the rest of the day?  Fucking just a bunch of puss.  Yeah.  What?  What do you mean?  Fuck a bunch of puss.  Are you going to go to lunch with that girl?  No.  Why?  I ain't got no money.  I got $1.60.  Well, make her pay.  She has money.  She wasn't into him, Bob.  Did you?  I mean, you saw that.  She was freaked out by him.  And first of all, she was into Chipper. 
[03:41:30]  I don't think so.  Yeah, here's a little words back.  You're block cocking.  Fucking think about it.  You're right.  You can take those.  Goodbye.  Bye, Chipper.  Bye, Chipper.  Words back.  Yeah, so you're married.  You're done.  You were never a creep, though.  No.  I don't know how you exist on this show.  You have like a normal sexual experience, like a normal sexual life.  Yeah, I stay on the periphery of things.  I was talking with Jess this weekend about like partners and stuff, like who's the most 
[03:42:00]  whatever you've been with, because we know each other's lists.  Did she start using a calculator on her iPhone?  Yeah.  Well, that way, I mean, we banged, but we didn't, you know, but neither of us, we've  been together since we were 21, 22, and, you know, we've been with a handful of people  each.  We don't, we're neither of us are creeps.  Well, it's, I, it really depends on how sex was brought up in your life.  I mean, sex was forbidden for me, and then I learned sex from other friends my age or 
[03:42:30]  older.  You know what I mean?  Like if your parents are smart enough to teach you about sex, and it's all right, and you  learn about it in a healthy way, I learned about it in a fucked up way, so it was more  like a thing you do to feel good, or that your friends do, and then it became an addiction  in my 20s and early 30s.  So did it start rebellious, and so you're like, yeah, this is cool.  It's like something to do.  It's like, it's like eating is now with me, you know, when you have, like when you're  an addict, I'm an addict.  You, you know, you go to drugs, you get, you quit those, you alcohol and smoking and, and 
[03:43:00]  then, and it's food and sex.  Well, yeah, that's, I'm not an addict.  Yeah.  And so I don't have that, you know, I don't have that problem.  Fuck, I wish I didn't, because, I mean, you know, it's hard now, because I, I mean, I  don't think about it when I'm home.  Sex, you mean?  When you have the responsibility of your family and, you know, you're working, are you doing stuff  all the time, but when you have that downtime that comics have in the hotel room all day,  the day, the day, from the time you wake up until eight o'clock at night. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  You usually have radio, and then you're around all fucking day.  Yeah.  We're like vampires.  Right.  And it's like, what are you going to do?  Sex is so easy.  The hunt, even porn, it would be great to go home right now and hunt everything she's  ever done down and put, like, little blocks on my, my screen.  You're talking about Melanie Monroe.  And play every one of them at the same time and see where I come.  And then, and then, and you'd be thinking about her being in here and giving you a hug.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  And what could have been?  I don't think she would, she'd be thoroughly disappointed.  Maybe, but still, that's not the part that you think, you know?  I would, I think about that now.  I have, I have image, body, you know, image, I hate myself.  Body image issues.  Yeah, that, that, I, well, yeah, if I, if I was in shape, Bob, which I've been four times  on this show.  I've known you as in shape, Bob.  I think three in shape, Bob.  Mm-hmm.  I would have, it's harder for me.  That, you know what's weird?  No.  As I think, I think, Sam Bones, and this is what you're going to think is weird. 
[03:44:30]  Tell me.  Do you, you, so now you tell me if it's weird.  Okay, I'm going to tell you if this is weird after you tell me what it is.  I think me and food and being heavy is subconsciously, I do it and keep it on because it keeps me  away from being a creep.  I see where you're going.  Because if I get into shape again, I get more opportunities to get my ding ding touched.  Yeah, but you know, I mean, and you know.  What?  That you can still get your ding ding touched and be out of shape. 
[03:45:00]  I'm not, no, no.  I would have to pay for it.  I would, it's like an instant like this.  I don't know.  Maybe I could.  But when you're in shape and chicks want you, there's something about a girl wanting to  touch your shit.  Yeah, but you're also, you're on stage, you're a comedian, you have a good personality, you  know, you make the women laugh.  Listen, dude, laughter only goes so far.  Is that right?  Yeah, man.  It's not going this far.  Yeah, yeah.  Laughter.  There's a poundage that we've exceeded that laughter will make up for. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, dude.  I can, I go to a certain amount, but no, this, it's, so I think in a way it's almost like,  fuck, maybe I, if I get shredded again and then, you know, oh, sex is the worst.  So food sucks because you have to eat, but sex is terrible.  Well, sex will ruin your life, but food can kill you.  Yeah.  Literally can, and can kill you.  Yeah, they're both bad.  It will give you disease to kill.  I mean, James Gandolfini.  He died because of drugs, let's be honest. 
[03:46:00]  They said there's no drugs in his body, didn't they?  Well, that doesn't matter.  You could be sober.  Oh, they do.  Look at my, I know people who have been sober for years and died because of their drug abuse  on their heart and body.  Right.  I have years and years of abuse with food and alcohol and drugs and stress and.  But you can't get comfortable being out of shape?  Like, you can't sit there, because I was, you can't sit there and say, okay, I'm going  to be heavy.  But I mean, I'll stop here.  I'm just going to keep getting heavier and heavier. 
[03:46:30]  But this is going to be me.  I think there's a point.  Right now, that's not it.  I mean, I quit smoking and then I had a baby.  I mean, I've totally given myself every excuse in the world, but I think now it's at the  point where I have to, you know, I got to, I got to put the brakes on and I got to take  care of business because you, I got to run around with this motherfucker in a couple months.  Right.  Right.  Baby's going to start walking and running and.  Yeah.  I got to take care of business.  It just sucks.  Plus, I mean, it's for your health at this point. 
[03:47:00]  And you're like, okay, now this thing that just popped out of my wife is a thing.  It's my son.  It's reliant on me being alive.  My son.  We can call.  We can say my son now.  This organism.  No, when, when, when it was inside, you could say that.  But now that it's out, you can say son.  This it.  No, none of it.  They came out.  This sort of.  We could say Max.  Yeah, we could say, but it's also just kind of a, this.  No, but you can.  Blob.  You know.  No, not a blob.  It's not a blob.  No, it's not a blob.  It actually has a shape.  It looks, looks like a human.  Right.  Like this human shape. 
[03:47:30]  Bones that has not developed yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's not it.  It's reliant on you being alive.  Yeah.  And so you can't be out of.  You can't be a fucking live.  I, I, I'm not, I'm not, I've, I've, I've, I don't not go to the hospital.  I've, I've, I've been checked out yearly.  I'm fine.  Everything's fine.  I have, my heart is fine.  I don't even have high blood pressure for God's sakes.  It's.  But yeah, it's just, you're absolutely right.  Yeah.  You gotta be in shape.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, it's hard for people who, I love people who email me and have gotten in 
[03:48:00]  a shape or, or fat, you know, you know, they have that addiction, but there's a lot  of people that don't, you know, you don't have it.  No.  You just, you've never been.  This is probably Rick.  Right now is as fat as I've ever been.  Probably.  Right.  I mean, you're, you're unattracted to me fat.  Right.  Like I don't want you anymore.  Right.  No.  Yeah.  Like that, that sort of baby skinny, like my metabolism is obviously catching up.  I'm getting older.  Yeah.  You have five o'clock shadows a little thicker. 
[03:48:30]  Right.  It's there.  Well, I had to stop shaving every day.  Cause the, as you, well, bumps on my neck.  Right.  Well, I don't know.  So what are those?  What?  Razor bumps.  Razor bumps.  Razor bumps.  So I can't, I can't shave.  Everybody has their own cross to bear.  Yeah.  I'm fat and you have bumps on your neck.  Right.  I prefer the, because now I just shave every three days.  I want to know, did you see Superman?  No.  You didn't.  I finally, I saw this weekend.  I went to the first summer movies I've been to all summer.  Right.  I've been sleeping on everything.  I didn't see Iron Man. 
[03:49:00]  I didn't see Superman.  I didn't see World War Z.  I didn't see any of these movies.  There's a lot of good movies out right now.  Have you seen This Is The End?  What's that?  That's the.  Oh, I heard that's funny.  Oh my God.  Is it funny?  Is it?  It's really funny.  It looks hilarious.  And those movies usually turn me off.  But those, that looks funny.  And all the guys that are in it, that you might be tired of because they've been playing  the same thing over and over again.  They're the only guys in comedies for the last four years.  Exactly.  They're funny in this because they're making fun of everything that they're hated for. 
[03:49:30]  It's funny.  You know what I mean?  They're taking on these.  It's funny.  It's a smart thing to do.  And you know what I love about those guys is they always help.  They've helped each other become famous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish we did that.  Right.  They all, you see these guys and they all start together, but.  And we just come on this show and stay the same.  And just shit on each other.  And we try to push each other down.  We just shit on each other and keep each other exactly where we are.  The only people that hang out with your group of friends.  Yeah.  The ones that get famous are the ones that escape.  Kevin Hart's in this movie. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, that makes me sick.  And at one point he was like, he was with, he was at the cellar.  Now he was, first of all, Kevin was with us for seconds.  Really?  Yeah.  He came in.  Keith brought him down.  He hung out for a couple minutes.  And he was gone.  Was he gone to go on to something else or did he start getting famous right away?  He, look, man, he's just, there's certain guys.  There's people that are born that way.  My acting teacher said that.  Tom Cruise was born famous. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  You're born that famous.  You don't get to become, you don't get to work hard in acting class and, and become  a great actor and get to become that famous.  People that big or people.  Predestined.  Yeah.  It's just the way it is.  But there's a whole other, there's a lot of room in between there and fucking not famous.  Like Philip Seymour Hoffman was probably not born famous.  He actually developed a skill.  Absolutely.  And became good. 
[03:51:00]  Absolutely.  And it's like, that guy is so good.  But, but like Kevin Hart, I swear, not only is he in this movie, but before this is the  end starter, you know, you're watching the trailers and the trailer for his standup  special.  Yeah.  That's coming to theaters flames.  Yeah.  He's got fire going.  It's a movie.  Yeah.  It's like a movie movie.  The microphone's almost as tall as him.  Yeah.  He's a little guy.  He's a movie movie though.  Yeah.  I mean, he is.  Well, he did what Eddie, Eddie Murphy did it years ago.  Um, and then, uh, who else did it fucking not very many people. 
[03:51:30]  Well, yeah, but, but Kings of comedy.  Yeah.  But that's four of them.  Yeah.  But here's, it happens every once in a while.  Yeah.  It just happens.  He's a very funny guy.  It happened.  Look at this.  Four of them.  Think of the, who was the, who was the, out of those four Kings of comedy, who really became  a star?  Well, not all four of them.  No.  I mean, they're all, look at, they're all popular.  They all make a great living.  They're all funny.  One of them's dead, but that's the one who became a big star, Bernie. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  He popped.  He was the one who was in the movies.  You're right.  He popped.  I mean, Steve Harvey found his thing.  They all found their thing.  They all found their thing.  Exactly.  But Bernie Mac was the one who went on to blockbuster movies.  Yeah.  So, I mean, Kevin Hart is just that guy.  Dane was that guy.  Who else was that guy?  But do you think it's.  Patrice wasn't that guy.  No, but he's the guy who was as good as anyone.  Patrice, let me tell you something, man.  I listened to his album the last, uh, last week.  I was taking, I decided to take the train more just so I can move. 
[03:52:30]  I love cabs.  You know what?  Patrice might've been that guy, but rebelled against it.  Patrice, but he was never that guy.  He was always, he was always on the out.  He was never on the in.  But didn't he put himself on the out specifically?  Didn't he have these opportunities?  Because he was, I know what you're saying, yes.  Because he's Patrice, he was on the out.  Right.  He never, he never kissed ass or gave people what they wanted.  He just gave them what he was.  Right.  Which, if he showed up and he didn't like your face, he'd tell you.  He would tell you. 
[03:53:00]  No matter who you were.  He'd kick out half the crowd before he started the show.  Right.  But he was that good to do it.  Like, you know, there's certain comics you can't just kick out half the crowd.  We gotta wrap up.  He was, he was the best though.  I think he was.  His last CD that I listened to this week, I was laughing hysterically on the train.  Yeah.  And it still makes me go, fuck, I suck.  He was on stage, there was nobody funnier.  And in life, there was just nobody funnier.  He was probably the greatest comic of our time.  Probably.  Yeah.  And I'm the 50th. 
[03:53:30]  Well, you're working though.  Of our time.  You're getting there.  And 50 is high.  I don't know.  But of our group, not of our time.  Of the people you know.  Yeah, the people who come on O&A.  You're about the 50th best.  I got my special coming out this summer though.  We're filming it.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, you're gonna come to it?  Yeah, where is it?  It's gonna be, we have, it's either gonna be Jersey or New York.  I'll be there.  So we're gonna pick.  I'm thinking Jersey.  I like Jersey people.  Jersey will be fun.  All right, look.  Ryan and Fez are coming up next.  Bobby, thanks for hanging out.  Foxwoods this weekend.  Foxwoods this weekend.  Tonight, I can't talk about it.  I'm gonna be watching Food Network tonight at 9.30, but that's just what I'm doing.
