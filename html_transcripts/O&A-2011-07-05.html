<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a contentious discussion featuring comedian Colin Quinn and later, Pat Cooper.  Colin expressed anger towards Jim Norton stemming from a car ride incident where he insulted Jim's appearance, further criticizing Jim's perceived self-serving post-HBO special career trajectory.  Colin also detailed his massive, disorganized writing project – a “manifesto” – his recent divorce, struggles with depression, and a concerning incident where he leaned over his apartment balcony.

Pat Cooper then joined, offering his perspectives on stand-up, roasting (criticizing Jim Norton's material as too explicit), and the work ethic of younger comedians. He shared numerous profane anecdotes from his career, including clashes with bookers and other comedians. He also discussed his upcoming roast and his experiences with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien, claiming Howard Stern’s reaction to their antics inadvertently propelled their careers.  The conversation then devolved into a graphic discussion about bodily functions, specifically defecation, complete with detailed descriptions and absurd anecdotes, culminating in a listener defecating into a bag on air.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a news story about a mugged 101-year-old woman and a columnist’s call to action.

The show continued with a debate about the 101-year-old woman’s mugging, exploring self-defense for the elderly and listener reactions, many expressing outrage and advocating for harsh punishment including the death penalty. The hosts interjected with absurd hypotheticals, such as Rocky Balboa defending the woman.  They also discussed their own finances, a plan to secretly move money, and an upcoming St. Patrick's Day event.  The conversation then turned to the Jessica Lunceford case, resulting in graphic and angry commentary about the perpetrator and various methods of capital punishment.  One host then launched into a fantastical monologue about seizing control of the US government, invading Venezuela, and restructuring society, complete with a new currency ("Kumias") and assigned cabinet positions for his co-hosts.  Listeners offered suggestions, and the segment concluded with a discussion of the hosts' difficult childhoods and regrets.

A later segment focused on relationships, beginning with reflections on past crushes and their disillusionment upon encountering those individuals as adults.  Anecdotes of unrequited love and betrayal were shared, followed by a conversation with stand-up comedian Mike.  Mike discussed his experiences in the NYC comedy scene, conflicts with a club owner, and his struggles with heroin addiction, criminal activity, and the death of his wife. He connected these experiences to his comedy and perspective on life, contrasting idealized expectations with reality.  The conversation also touched upon various types of "dumbness" among their friends.  Mike elaborated on his coping mechanisms and how his past shaped him.

The show concluded with a caller recounting two distinct experiences. First, he described his early stand-up career, starting with an offensive joke about Guatemalans, and his successful performance at a Narcotics Anonymous convention in Fort Lauderdale, fueled by his past drug experiences in Florida.  He then detailed a paid encounter in Los Angeles where he watched a married couple have sex, describing it as arousing yet depressing, highlighting the wife's "look" as a key element.  He concluded by discussing his girlfriend’s interest in swinging and his strict criteria for potential partners. The hosts interjected with comments and jokes throughout the caller's stories.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  now this is cool this is something unique and different oh it's a nice change of pace  strap on your douche chill belt that just stinks there's no substance to it  oh it's just this big confusing mess of who gives a crap yeah we suck anything else um  as we were talking colin just was saying uh why don't you bring on your accountant and he was  dismissing me by not looking at me with his fucking awful middle finger pointed at me yeah 
[00:00:30]  which i thought was why the anger disrespectful well here's the thing about jim as you guys know  i spoke to you briefly at the pat cooper roast and i said i really disgusted with jim and as you know  i'm only half joking when i say things like that yeah and i mentioned that here's what bothers me  about jim what okay i've mentioned this to him before okay we're in a car one day and i was  probably seeing him he drives me uptown in his crummy car non-celebrity car the fancy caddy what  are you talking about it's a kind of key is i drove you up harry obviously you haven't taken a ride with 
[00:01:00]  jimmy in a while every caddy it's a camry caddy it looks like a camry it feels like camry and nobody  knows to caddy unless you say it actually took the insignia off so i get so really caught me here and his  girl and you know and so maybe i was zing a little hard you forget sometimes because we're comedians we  bust balls but when you call jimmy like i kept calling what an ugly creep and how he's worked out to look  mediocre and i forget that like you know what comedians we bust balls probably his childhood  had a lot of pain and horror as he should have so suddenly here we are me being a snide kind of 
[00:01:30]  idiot his girlfriend sitting there probably politely putting up with it and then jim outburst goes so  what about you you act like you were at 10 when you were younger you weren't that great looking just  with total anger like holding in this nonsense no and i was like first of all i never thought i was  at ten i was about to say i was a hard seven he was you were fucking six me now you will not make  a monologue out of this no he's lying he's lying he's lying he's lying no because it's a 40-minute 
[00:02:00]  dissertation that's not true it's a falsehood you're spreading falsehood i wasn't angry here's  what colin does i believe me i wasn't mad me and my girlfriend's still laughing at that house  she's like what did colin say he was that day i'm like a hard seven but he acts like colin acts like  he's fucking ten pounds away from the glory days like he was fucking no i don't he well all right  140 he acts like he was beautiful and he was not a bad looking guy but that's all i said i never  thought you were gorgeous but doesn't say the fact that he thinks that but no it's true well even if 
[00:02:30]  it had been true which i i know how i really thought but even if i did think that why would  you let an old man have his own delusion because you're not that much older than me he screamed  i didn't scream at you the amount of anger there and here's my other point okay here's my other  point what other point you haven't made one to begin with no he's my first and only point and  he is a lot older than you he's 10 years older than me i'm 38 i'm 39 you're nine years older than me but  in entertainment years calvin's a hell of a lot older than you yeah but here's what bothers me 
[00:03:00]  the fact that he's angry about that is true that was pretty funny i thought well i thought it was  i don't think it was an insult but apparently it was  i don't like the fact that jim right after his last special goes to the club every night because  it's almost like hey man i'm a gym rat i just work at stand-up you're a compulsive ass take a few  weeks off shut up and let me finish no i'll tell you why i'm not a gym rat you think to yourself hey i'm  a guy that just blue collar i take my lunch pail into the club every night with your fake humility and i'm 
[00:03:30]  putting a stop to it today why i don't want people here's your face hold on no no no you're compulsive  take a few weeks off and just breathe i'm compulsive you're seeing yourself in front of a buffet  oh that was hurtful of course it was but it's not true the reason i do it is because i don't think  a buffet would i know i couldn't think of a better way to say it was good but the bottom line is i don't  want people coming out if you see the hbo special and seeing the same shit they're gonna get pissed  off it's selfish i want to make more money i was trying to say though you don't you don't seem to enjoy all the 
[00:04:00]  success i do enjoy the success i love doing stand-up i'm trying to stop any enjoyment of this  i don't want him to enjoy it if he has any chance of enjoying it i'm putting a stop to it now look  another chewed pen i think the i'm gonna keep chewing the pens i don't know whoever it is  is going to get what are you doing he's putting it up his ass there you go enjoy enjoy the chewed pen  oh god damn it chew on that shit ew now wait a minute yes that's shit all right um you have to 
[00:04:30]  be careful with that kind of behavior no i don't like i want to do new stuff so i was done with the  set in june and i started doing new stuff i got i don't want you to do the same material people come  out and see me they're not going to see the same act you know he's a little that i'm picking up  something here what i don't want to completely bash jimmy i'm picking up something i think jimmy is  assuming that everyone has seen the hbo special yeah you're right so that he's got to get new  material because when they go out everyone that's there has seen his uh uh old material no one has 
[00:05:00]  seen it but it's more than that not everyone no but but i do think that a good amount of people will  calm who have seen it hold on we're trying to change this can i address my friend i think there's  truth in both no i don't assume i really don't believe me i would love to be able to just live  off that for another year but you can't not what i'm saying what what i'm saying is that you think  you fancy yourself a humble gym rat that goes down to the club and just works it out and i want you to 
[00:05:30]  stop coming to the club and if i see you there again i'm gonna punch you in the snap well you're never  there what are you talking about you're fucking lonely psychopath if i decide to go there you know  you're writing a manifesto like fucking ted kaczynski you're never there he's just in front of this  computer rallying about technology and jews and the fucking lesbians that run showbiz what are you  talking about how do you know where i am he's starting to leave the house again that's right  i'm here aren't i you're an agoraphobic creep you had to because mizzoli threatened to fire you if  you didn't fucking plug playing eight tickets sold it's like go on the radio no one knows you're in our 
[00:06:00]  club oh that's why he's here to plug it's fine the hurt that is going on over here  there's no hurt at all oh that's where you have to go out and plug when you're on it you're doing  a gig oh do you believe this idiot's trying to act like mr pragmatic shut your mouth it's the truth  it's reality i'm i am a very pragmatic which i think means realistic guy i'm not exactly sure  a pragmatic call what's going on it means fun and joyful what's going on with colin uh well actually  what jimmy's saying is semi-correct in that i have been writing my manifestos okay but they're not 
[00:06:30]  really against anything particular it's just basically it's a compilation you know i'm like  what happened was i got ahead of myself psychologically and wrote thousands and thousands of  pages so my apartment looks a little bit like kaczynski is a height a little bit like beautiful  mind yeah just no stuck to the walls with strings connecting bits together yeah and that's the problem  so i've been trying to organize but it's very difficult i wish i had like a you know i fantasize  about having like a really efficient asian like assistant you know yes in stockings and 
[00:07:00]  of course the other part of it yes and mail you know but i'm just that's what it's going on with  me you know why don't you get yourself a trapper keeper i used to use those to organize when i was  or the five section don't book but i got like so many you know what i mean i was like that it is like  it's gone it's gone a little out of my control yeah what is this thing gonna be a book it's just so  many things it's too many pages of things wow are you being serious for once yes yes yes you just 
[00:07:30]  you just sit there and you're typing away no he's not like is i just go to ob like i was actually  got all the stuff like yeah you're really trying to like i was like yeah i'll be on the stands like  i got him and he goes you're being serious it was weird it's it's weird weird it's weird when you get  serious colin oh i thought you meant it was weird i have all my thousands you're very you're very  protective yes you only see one side of you the sarcastic side we don't get to see the real  sweet colin we don't get to see the sweet colin you have a big fat shell around you 
[00:08:00]  i picture you crying alone in your apartment some nights  no not really crying you know there's a lot more anger than me chewing the inside of his  mouth like a coke addict right yeah there's a lot more you know just trying to see other  sides you imagine myself yeah this is kind of an intervention you didn't realize what you  stepped into well i'm just trying to say like i'm not really i don't see myself as hurting myself  before really damaging a lot of people other people so i don't want an analysis of it you know  really you don't like when i was in your 30th floor apartment and he steps over the rail and 
[00:08:30]  he's kind of hanging on and letting go for a second you know yes he was that's cool yes he was  36 and doing like the oh where you let go fall backwards and then grab the rail all right colin  that's a problem like that that's a bit oh that's cool that's cool i'd lean out the window and hang  on from what the on the set 17th floor no the uh the office on the 17th floor why would you wait  wait could you slow down a minute whose apartment was this his my so you have an outdoor space a  balcony balcony and he was on the outside of the road yes he stepped outside the railing and he's 
[00:09:00]  like letting go for it not going back that far that's because the audience what were you hoping for  a really good reaction from your friends well you know i was hoping like your butterfingers he was  hoping he was hoping a straight pigeon would come by and jar me and sniffing his eye you were hoping  for an ounce of care from from jim norton the last thing you see is a smiling jim norton looking over  the railing that's how colin gets love he can't just say i need some love he has to hang on to a rail  so we'll all go no don't like he wants us to he wants the value of having everyone appreciate 
[00:09:30]  the fact that he's turning my great beginning analysis this what was your beginning analysis  about you well suddenly it's turn around about me so what that's the way life is turn about is  fair play i always say and why would you and you would hang out tough talk you would hang out the  window yeah but that's that was easy i don't remember such a small part of the manifesto i can't  even believe we're discussing it that's nothing to me but you could have you do understand you could  have nah fallen nah to your death yes but it didn't happen what but that didn't bother you or 
[00:10:00]  how far did he lean back before he grabbed hold again doesn't matter just stepping up but that  doesn't matter just the act of doing it dude i would be freaked out there stepping on the other  side of the rail holding on tight but some people are also very scared of heights like bobby kelly's  been over my house a couple times and he goes in the balcony don't don't push me you know it's like  no he's afraid the balcony is gonna just crack under his weight as he should be you better up  back in a steamroller on your fucking balcony and bob step onto it yeah he's scared that he's gonna go 
[00:10:30]  right through that railing with a slight push he's scared and the balcony is also scared they look at  each other with a mutual understanding just look over me from inside i'll do what i can for you kid but  while i'm stepping on that balcony it'd be like an elephant stepping onto a piece of tracing paper  short poor bob not here for bob right here to defend himself  fuck poor bob with a black cock right in his mouth that's what i say to bob 
[00:11:00]  fucking juicy lips fucking grab his head and fuck his throat  how you got colin laughing where's he crying who knows are you crying laughing what do you got over  there colin i don't think it'll hold tracing paper so you're gonna be a gotham colin yeah  but what about the manifesto i need an organized assistant what are you trying to do yeah what is 
[00:11:30]  it don't know is it like a huge book is it a book about your life it's everything everything then start  writing a blog are you a blogger no i blogged for a couple days it was boring well why don't you  fucking stop being such an isolated homo and fucking get someone to help you sell it yeah why  the isolation i don't know uh-oh we are getting the serious call yeah we're breaking it down my  depressed i think that's my theory my theory is he hasn't told me that but i theorize he's a little  depressed some drugs what the suffolk county solution 
[00:12:00]  and that's all my friend i know but where you from aren't you from yeah i'm from suffolk  where are you from huntington oh no not wrong he's changing the subject to where you're from  that's never good i'll go right back to it go ahead are you depressed are you depressed no i'm  actually coming out of depression but i was depressed you're seeing how are you you seem uh  way better than the last time i saw you thank you exactly i'm dead serious i'm being serious now  i'm agreeing with you you had like you you had like a jesus christ you had a distant look in your 
[00:12:30]  eyes for a while there you know i don't see that today yeah i don't see that today  more yeah right now did you name your computer charlene about anything  anything in particular or just one of those uh chemical imbalance depressions no i think i was  just depressed in general a lot of stuff you know i don't know i don't think it was chemical you find  yourself sleeping late no no not like that i always sleep late you know how did you get out of the  depression just kind of just you know just facing it you know i mean i've been going to therapy for 
[00:13:00]  many years anyway but yeah working out and stuff no obviously not how could you ask that  he's obviously not no no i'll say something else jesus i'm going to say something else looks like  he did lose a few pounds that's why you asked that thanks hope did you what do you think of that  i i'm not going to bad mouth three years of working out and no definition whatsoever but i  understand i'd shut up by the way no definition i said a few not a lot by the way yeah you want to 
[00:13:30]  feel the guns i can look right here and i'm telling you i i agree actually i i have been kind of swinging  in the wind there working out hoping for a little definition but i can't stop eating it's your eating  habits i know it is yeah it's not the food uh so what you just started living your life again like  no i still haven't started living my life but i've been depressed but i've just been working on  certain things but you know it's also it's a lot of stuff you know i mean i hate to even talk about  it because it really is about the manifesto i hate to say it it really is yeah you know and so that's 
[00:14:00]  a big part of it you know is is in the manifesto is it your life is it some fiction is it like i don't  know it's a bunch of different things but it's just just organized you know like you would just  what wake up in the middle of the night and go hey let me type away here and like some ideas  it just spill out of you yeah and also my brought my divorce was a big thing but i oh i didn't  realize it at the time i forced it to happen but you know you back up your stuff on computers 
[00:14:30]  stupid or no oh boy what's wrong with him yeah i just i had this vision is opening up here i'll  tell you what backup i had this because i had this vision of him writing for years yeah and he's  such a losing it and losing our surge so i'm like yeah do you back it up of course okay don't  say of course that you're savvy so you never got over the divorce no but i think that affected me  greatly oh why because it had stupid wives because carl was in love oh was that i'm sorry yeah he 
[00:15:00]  wasn't in a miserable marriage yeah he wasn't married for a long time it was a short one oh man  do you see like that was it your fault do you think i don't think you can find anybody in the world  that could say it was anything but my really yeah there's no i literally left her no choice it's  a hundred percent no choice if there's a hundred percent of anything do you want to share get it  off your chest wow i just literally left it like she had no choice but to leave like what type of 
[00:15:30]  things were you doing that a woman would not enjoy or want to be around he is the ultimate thing  what i really did in the long run to chase her away was cheated on her and then told i'm not saying  i'm gonna not cheat again all right all right we think that gene simmons that's pretty much  a hundred percent you know i i was waiting for the explanation of a hundred percent he just nailed  it yeah there's not a better definition of a hundred percent than that right really are forcing  the person to be pushing him right out of there yeah if you would have like begged and said oh i'm 
[00:16:00]  sorry i i absolutely wouldn't do this again then you could say all right there might be a glimmer of  hope but when you say you might go to therapy and figure this out together but when you say uh  or if it's like 1973 it's me and kevin klein in the ice storm you know standing there in our jackets  honey it's a swinging world but yeah i just left it a choice you know wow and that bothers you  well it bothers me because you know yeah but it does bother me a little then why do you uh why'd you 
[00:16:30]  cheat well at the time it didn't bother me oh okay and then you realize that you really blew it and  that's yeah yeah i have to say my work the things i've been working on are just the fact that i've  written certain amounts of shows and certain amounts of movies that don't get done that are  really like what should be done and i just feel like they end up doing crummy versions of it eventually  it really makes me so angry yeah about show business i can't even i can't even talk about  i can't jokingly talk about the level of fury that i feel about it and i know that relative to a 
[00:17:00]  six-year-old like a sudanese child my problems mean nothing to me they're actually more important  that's what we differ but compared to the people that i know do certain things or get certain  success it just i can't help it i know it's thinking i know it's the cliche of bitterness  but i know that my work it all should be done i prove i prove it every time i do do get some things  i just want to burn down about eight networks and kill about from 5 000 people same crap happens to us in

[00:28:30]  gonna put a butt on it i know you are and i respect him and i think he knows i mean that the last 15  minutes of that home box was tough to talk about a woman's private parts the way he did  i thought was not was too heavy you don't have to do that because he's funny he's natural he's got a  great way about him saying why go talking about a woman's clit because i like it's a  shit i like that it's not funny no i understand i like a big clip cut i agree but you know something 
[00:29:00]  he's working to one particular audience hopefully that they will and i'm saying here's a guy that's  what what the hell is he doing why is he underneath a woman's ass sucking at this and sucking at that  that's not funny it is what's funny what's funny is what he did because i said this guy's this guy's  wonderful but why and i like him and i say myself this guy's he's gonna have to take it out one day  because it's gonna hurt him you don't need that because you got women saying wait a minute is that  what we're about you talk about our vagina and our pussy like with garbage dumps and that's what it 
[00:29:30]  sounds like i don't think he meant it that way i don't think you meant it that way and again i i  care about we're in a great business i'm on my way out i've been on my way out since i was 40.  on your way out i'm serious how far away is that door i'm on my way out jesus i'm i'm lucky  i made this this is the last yes a long hallway out the door oh but you see you're taking liberties  which is fine if you feel comfortable but fine but i'm looking at as a comedian i'm saying to myself  jesus christ you don't need that this guy don't need that i want him on a series i said that's what 
[00:30:00]  i'm hoping this guy gets get him on a series that's the money today no no my acting is not up to snuff  date line nbc we don't want the creditor series i saw you on that series you were wonderful thank you  lucky louie app but no see you were the only good thing on the show because you had brains to say i can't  act see that's the secret then they're going to get some session to get your own series because  but those who can't act get a fucking series that's why the guys who have this series surround  themselves with greatness well that's true do you think seinfeld was a good actor right no no 
[00:30:30]  all the time jerry was smart i respect jerry because he surrounded himself yeah i respected  a mary tyler moore they surrounded himself all in the family surrounded ray romano isn't a good  actor absolutely who ray romano's got trouble humming  but he's a nice man he got the series god bless him i don't i don't be i'm not jealous of him who  gives a damn i'm out it's finished i'm 78 it's all over but at least we're in a profession i want this 
[00:31:00]  gentleman to know you know i care about you because you're good and you're wonderful and you but i'm  saying somebody maybe that doesn't like him so keep doing it and i'm saying i think one day they're  going to say to you you gotta cut that out that thing because it's vulgar it's not funny anymore to get  you know my tongue i'm looking at that he's doing noises that don't that don't fit and i'm talking  to the set and my lady friends go why is he talking about people's brother i said shut up will you  please the guy's a comedian what the fuck you expect them to talk about cucumbers but but i do like that 
[00:31:30]  it is the truth like i do really like a big that's okay i'm not saying you don't like your material  don't know i'm a pussy i'm a big person basically he's asking do you like a swollen like he does i like a  fat but you gotta understand the the people that are listening to this are not in a comedic adult  mode i'm talking about because i've been around a long time and the only rap that people said to me  about this guy was the exact thing i said they said why did he do that last eight ten minutes because he 
[00:32:00]  don't need it he's a funny man and all of us said and and you know they could tell me my my  fucking business i would respect him i don't tell him how to funny i don't tell him how to drive  but but when you care about a guy you care you say this guy's good you don't need that  shit this guy's good you want jimmy to go mainstream no no i didn't say that well  well it's not this you're not a comic do me a favor do your fucking radio you're not in my  fucking league i love these guys i don't do fucking radio you stay out of my fucking business i don't 
[00:32:30]  tell the butcher how to cut meat don't tell that guy how to masturbate you understand i was just trying  to follow you i guess you can't follow nobody that's why you got this fucking show but i like  i know what you mean though but i like i don't mind getting that dirty i'm comfortable being that  dirty because i i i don't feel like i have to close with it but i like it it's like i'm not saying that  to take it out right i'm telling you i guarantee you somebody's gonna pop down the show that's the  lesson you want to do here yeah you got to cut that out otherwise you're gonna have a problem so you 
[00:33:00]  cut it out what's the big fucking thing you're only gonna live on that piece of material no of  course not now that's not the great things but just about the matter i guess i'm not gonna get  nobody's gonna remember what you did except that piece of you know what though he's killed on  letterman and leno and he's done clean stuff on there no bullshit he did not kill with that material  on let him he talk about a pussy and eat oh no that's what i mean he's able to work though that's  what i'm saying if he can go on let him i don't know if he gets pussy i would read him go on  let him in and jay leno's i'm not knocking the man's talent he's a talented guy but i think that 
[00:33:30]  particular choice he don't need because this guy can skyrocket and i think somebody's i'm not going  to dress you can't work as we say vagum and say the hilton hotel you know that kind of a thing or a  certain high-class hotel they'll say look you got to draw the line so i think he's what do you think  of his advice there i understand what he's saying this is me doing radio by i do understand what pat is  saying um i don't agree 100 because when you look at guys that have got again it's all doing what 
[00:34:00]  you like i'm looking at you fuck those guys it's it's uh uh uh kinnison succeeded very well doing  what he wanted dice succeeded doing what he wanted i don't model myself after those guys but i think if  you're doing what's true to you okay i'm just saying yeah okay okay i never heard richard prior to me  was one of the best i never heard don records to me is one of the best i never heard none of these guys  turn around and get raunchy you can talk about a woman's body part the many who say hello the hair 
[00:34:30]  was coming at it and the clit was hanging down i turned around and i got a heart off i said to my  girl i can't look at your pussy no more you're ugly which is why he's on television he must be right  so that's the end of it yeah i'm going at the transvestites that's my show hey well that we can  agree on uh it's just it's just a difference in a in a take on it but it's not a knock to you  well i think isn't it i dig it i think you're terrific and i think you're going to go wherever  you want to go thank you that's telling you to get up and become a prop comic no what he's telling 
[00:35:00]  yeah yeah let me ask you yes sir you don't know fucking comedy what you spend it for this guy  this guy's a community i'm trying to learn through jimmy about comedy you're learning days  you're going to be out of this fucking show i can't learn anyway that's uh you know that's  that's enough there but i you know we're in a great profession you're you're taking advice from  a guy wearing a members only jacket i do respect pat's opinion very much and do you respect his 
[00:35:30]  jacket yes i do i would i would scream to the top of my my lungs to say this is a wonderful young man  i said you know it's nice to see that in young people but when i saw that and i'm not a prude i've  done it all i've seen it all but i said they were great comics who never got that way are we getting  down to that next we talk about on my mother's pussy and then my father's cock and then it becomes you  know something what about grandpa no then they're going to talk about the pope that he messed up  then we're going to talk about subject matter that should be left alone we don't need to get a 
[00:36:00]  left i'll give you an instant i want to stand there today but so stern says you three guys roast pat  so i said that under one condition they can roast me short of paper way so they looked at me one guy says  i throw the paper away and he threw it away he goes by the way who's that cunt you're sitting next  to when i stopped that's let me tell you that's funny and stern says get out of here to you no not  me that's not not me i'm a genius of myself nobody tells me they'll throw him out off the  air before i go but i tried to explain to the guy after the show was over i said you're so stupid 
[00:36:30]  you went desperate you panicked you said what does my girlfriend's got to do with trying to roast  somebody jerry stiller was roasted a wonderful man one comic is asshole goes off it goes after  jerry stiller's wife's vagina what the fuck is that got to do with a roast because they panic  they think mother fuck them and if you say the curse words and there's a story it blends i got  a flow i can say 90 million nobody gets offended there's a certain flow there are people who say 
[00:37:00]  they go oh gee don't say that word that's the difference that's the difference but but and you're  right we all judge our own flow a certain way like i know what i do that's true to my thinking  like that guy probably did panic to blast someone's girlfriend and call her a cunt and it's stupid  for no reason at all but unless you're talking to paul mccartney well yeah exactly a one-legged one of  that um but to blast somebody uh the woman just for being there is panic move but to be vulgar because 
[00:37:30]  that's what you want to do is different yeah i agree with you there but the guy turns around  and all he had to do they don't have to force himself to try to be funny take it out on someone  that was not being roasted right you're roasting me don't roast that guy over there i can do it  because i am going to be roasted i can turn around and say go after his remarks and say what what this  man says to me is what pat does this now i'm going to turn to myself so really when i get up i'll say  this this that's a roast but when i go into the audience who has nothing to do with it the only thing i ever  did that that they still talk about it what's her name was in the uh it was in one of the rows there 
[00:38:00]  the girl that was uh ran away with with a gun with the uh oh yeah patty hers and she's sitting  in the front row and i go honey pat so nice to see you we know you did it yeah and there was like  and they'll play it yeah of course you gotta laugh and i backed away but that's a celebrity being in  the audience that's a famous person that's fair game i mean they're showing up yeah i agree but i  generally don't like to go in to the audience i like to see it up here and i tell people the secret 
[00:38:30]  of a roast is pay attention what you can't say and they go what do you mean i said they're going to  say this about that one this about that one you know you can't say it what what if you ain't got  enough go after somebody else on that day but just keep going so they want five six seven minutes  if you can't hold five six seven minutes and i see milton burr and i've done him with the biggest  get up and tell this particular comic stop you didn't do your homework what gives you the 
[00:39:00]  right he said what gives you the right to stand up with great talent now sit down and shut up  the guy was never on a roast again and i told him i try to tell you stay the  fuck off you got trouble whispering you got trouble spitting you don't know what the  the fuck you're doing i'm gonna be on a roast i'm gonna be on a roast all right you know it's the  chicken you stupid who is the comic i don't want to tell you none of your business who is the comic  that you are on howard show huh who is it oh no i don't know there were three young guys nice guys i 
[00:39:30]  didn't put the guy down i wasn't mad at him but my lady said you got to forgive him because he panicked  and he didn't know and right right and i tell you barry gary dollabody said he grabbed him he said let  me tell you something you see why this man's great he knows when to sweat and he said he didn't mean it i  said the man didn't mean it because he didn't know what the fuck to do i said now if you're  going to be in a state of panic don't go in that hallway you don't belong don't go on the days if  you don't belong he gets up this i belong fine now you're gonna have to put your fucking nickels down  and we've had some great stars who had trouble you know he's a lot of pressure for you guys now 
[00:40:00]  absolutely because pat uh what pat is talking about uh he's being roasted on friday at the friars  club we're all invited uh and i get to just sit there and uh jimmy will actually be roasting  pack over one of the many guys roasting you pat some water i'll ask my friend for some water  it's unopened unopened that's it could be open anyone that eats pussy i like to drink with  who do you think is that's ad-libbing that's using your comedic fucking mind that's when it comes 
[00:40:30]  natural right that's why when a young sick ass 30 year old tells me you're going to go into carolines  i said first of all go to school and learn your craft you don't go to a butcher and grab the nuts  i'm a fucking butcher go to school and find out who pat cooper is don't ask me for a tape you sick  fuck i said i want to take me you what do you want to take me for i want to know what the  fuck you do you scumbag i said how dare you work for carolines and he hung up on me now caroline 
[00:41:00]  i don't know nothing against caroline caroline doesn't even know comedy caroline is an empiric  a producer of comedy she stays home and hopes you get left and give a fucking laugh don't matter  we're under the hammer every fucking time we go out i'm 78 how many fucking hammers hit me over the  head so there you go but i respect my fellow comedian and i'm not looking to say i hope he  fucking bombs i come also listen to me you want to do some take that out maybe put that in it might  help you i don't know who do you think who do you think's a great roaster over the years who's 
[00:41:30]  really good up there a great roasters with the guys like uh rickles you know something no don't  rickles no when you say great roaster because don rickles and i told this to don in fact it was  roast we we were doing bob newhart and he was the one and seeing the show and and it didn't happen  mm-hmm you understand it just because he can't say the mexican over there the guy over there i said 
[00:42:00]  when the fuck do you talk about the days so but he decided well i'm not the guy who's all got to do  it so we all roasted bob newhart i tell you guys like burr were one of the greatest ones i did uh i  did a dean martin rose not the ones on tv had to be one of the best no but not no no i never did his  television show i'm talking was dean martin sinatra the uh uh uh uh tommy lasso i'm talking heavy  which when no girls were allowed and what's her name the comedian there she's about 90 years old 
[00:42:30]  but i don't know right uh bill stiller oh yeah she came in dressed as a man it's a true story  that's funny though man i think it was great all right good but they nailed her and they had a  lever out there now you're talking about stalkers you're talking about the guy that lived to be 90  years old george uh gracie allen and i mean you're talking about fat jackie lennon you're talking  about hennie youngman this is that pointing at him to beat us kind but this is where my my my my my  my expertise came from watching these guys on a roast i mean they they had writers i'm with you 
[00:43:00]  because uh the dean martin roast that they show on tv all the time and you can get the dvds they're just  amazing and i see a lot of these roasts on economy central and some of the guys they're really good at  but a lot of them are like uh but they got to learn from the did you know that dean martin  roast a lot of them are never in the same room what do you mean really no i'm going to teach you  something i love when you teach us something did you know that don rickles when he's roasting was  cost but was told to come down to the studio and they had pictures of james stewart pictures of john 
[00:43:30]  johnny carson and they just framed that get the fuck out of here so they have a close-up of just uh  don rickles not only don rickles a lot of them that then they would turn around and try to get them all  one day and just take that one maybe 30 seconds and show them but a lot of them holy  shit are you kidding me so they have a close-up i know you're not kidding me it's just an expression  relax don't jump down my throat we're having a conversation here i'm worried about his throat  no i want to follow you here so they got a close-up but those guys aren't even all the time 
[00:44:00]  well what they did is with some of these guys let's just say don guys i can't make it so now they got bob  hoped that so they inserted don into that that whole into the set right right so but a lot of  people didn't know that in fact his producer even said it when when they were interviewing him that's  tough that's tough so this is what they're but they can you know edit everything and make it make  it look so what are you trying to say with that it's easier to do what they were doing in the old  days because the the people they were roasting weren't there well let me put it this way if you 
[00:44:30]  fuck up right do it again i got you hello so guys what she's i don't like when i say make  that race that try again because it takes a certain amount of balls to actually like beat up these guys  right in front of their face so it would probably be easier if you're alone on set by yourself and  they're going to throw in the laugh tracks and the long shots of everyone laughing on the dais  it seems like it would be easier to beat someone up right fryers roast is the true roast and particularly  now with youngsters coming along who should look at the old roast and see what it's all because a lot 
[00:45:00]  of them buy material which is nothing wrong with that we got guys in the roast they go uh i'll give  you three lines give me a grand that says i'll tell you i'll give you 19 for nothing you assholes i  don't need none of them but guys needed so what happens is they turn around and they write something  guy gives them the grand or five one i'm not i guess these writers getting paid never never works  because the writer doesn't know what's inside this gentleman knows what's inside him yeah jimmy  doesn't use writers no but i'm bringing he knows what's inside of he knows where i can swim or more 
[00:45:30]  i can't swim a lot of them go i can do that i said no so in other words if somebody gives you a knife  you can open a head right i have a feeling you're going to be cracking some skulls on friday no way  you're going to jump up and beat some of these uh comedians up no if they can't take it get the  off that's a lot of pressure for these guys it's not pressure it's not pressure it's not pressure  because they accept it they accept it and the worst thing to do is one second true don't rehearse  it you can't rehearse a fucking roast they're in front of the mirror i know what i'm talking about  i'm talking about the fact that i'm talking about the fact that the worst part of a road 
[00:46:00]  is when the audience gets uncomfortable with the comedians brutalizing each other they get  uncomfortable with what we're comfortable with yeah which is shitting on each other uh and they  some the mcs to kind of let them know it's okay we're comfortable with this and you know no one's  getting their feelings nothing i've nothing's worse than watching a comic get up there though and the  first couple of of uh jokes they throw out just bomb and you sit there and go oh boy now what if you 
[00:46:30]  tell the comic before he goes on you say look come here just in case because i know the guy ain't gonna  make it i fucking know he can make it just in case you get up there and you go that at that did it  that that at that did it that better say it's been a pleasure get the off all right now i'm going to  tip you off paul schaefer remember paul schaefer yeah paul schaefer from the letterman show sure  all right we're roasting jerry lewis last year this guy comes in has to have a piano for him 
[00:47:00]  this guy's as funny as can't you understand i'm so that this  a fucking guy had the balls to come on a fucking roast roasting jerry lewis and he starts to try to  tell a story he was on 20 fucking minutes but he's playing a minute i love jeffy jeffy loves me  and i'm saying when the does he get off i go on after him because i'm last okay wait a minute my 
[00:47:30]  opening line is i want to thank you paul for giving jerry lewis a chance to go to sleep  you fucking asshole how dare you do i go in your fucking band and play you gotta stay out of that  that's what i'm trying to say you gotta blame the friars club though no why would they have a guy  like that in their in their fine establishment thinks he's a celebrity like he's got a brand  now they really think he could have pulled it off well they don't want to insult the guy no way  don't know like you should be the president whatever they need over there let me tell you 
[00:48:00]  something oh boy it's a lot of politics involved also we all know that and the idea is you can't  there's no more guys of my age anymore so these young guys are coming along who are great and it's  good for them to get up there and say i got fucking balls and you know if you don't kill but you  survive yeah well that's okay too mentally you go home you say you know something i'm with them  that's with the big guys right that really is the big guy but to see paul schaefer i said get the  fuck on the fuck it's like me going into his fucking van and say give me a kazoo because i 
[00:48:30]  think i can play along and you know something that's an insult because he didn't care right  about the fucking people wasted ten thousand dollar fucking tables and this guy comes up that's why  he's got a puppet how's your blood pressure pat i have not i died maybe uh hey is jerry lewis  gonna be there at your roast i know i got jerry lewis was taking catnaps not when i was on because 
[00:49:00]  he wouldn't dare see jerry lewis wouldn't there because i fucking glob him what's that about though  why would you sleep during your own house well oh and if you remember he had a milding heart attack  going back to vegas jerry's not well jerry in my opinion is probably one of the geniuses of our business  and jerry is 80 some odd years old has contributed so much that kind of comedy is over my comment  comment i'm asking because i'm getting involved with controversy and stuff but you know they're  talking about pussy more but you gotta know when to quit you gotta know yeah that's gotta be a hard 
[00:49:30]  thing though that's the sad part just leave walk away that's gotta be hard they said to me i got a  job for you in utah i said listen to me i love utah me and the mormons don't understand each other  i ain't going that's the end of it i don't go on a stage where i know i don't have a chance it's  ridiculous i i uh do you accept any gigs huh you got this guy from caroline do you tell him to go  fuck himself he says no a lot utah tells him no i'm not going there because the guy that's booking 
[00:50:00]  carolangelo the girl don't do their homework they say what does pat cooper do i said tell him i clean  fish what the fuck do i do you sick fuck what do you do how dare you insult me first of all how about  manners for an old an adult how about a young punk saying mr cooper you know but don't tell me what  do you do you little asshole go to school and learn about comedy what is who's milton burrell who's  groucho march who's all these guys and learn why they became successful now sit there and say i'm  booking acts now book your mother book your mother you're sick fuck out of the young guys who do you 
[00:50:30]  like it seems like you're but i saw a mob the other day well give us a few names like who do you  like out there pat you're like a legend you're not the district attorney come i'll turn your  mic off let me explain something i go past carolines the other day you need me because i can just do that  you know what i do for a hobby i rehearse dying  so let me tell you something let me tell you something yeah yeah i went past carolines the other 
[00:51:00]  day all right there was about how to be 100 comics there trying out for what to get into the festival  oh okay okay yeah okay the big uh new york comedy festival now i must tell you this every one of them  looked the same there was not one guy look neat and clean with a jacket and a guy i says this is the  same picture they're all coming in to do two minutes the only guy i understand what what i mean was  a guy with an indian cap on he went he got two minutes but as far as the young guys i know this 
[00:51:30]  gentleman when i met him you know we did the carlin quinn show and we had we have great shows  at carlin quinn sure but i don't i i i don't get a chance to see like sarah silverman she probably  great i never saw her you know i never saw a lot of the guys look at the guys on saturday night because  most of the times i'm working and then i forget about it you know you do bring up a good point  because i do see a lot of comedy and you see a lot of young comedians that are like playing the role  of a comic you know what i mean they got the look they got the lines they're very rehearsed but it's like 
[00:52:00]  i think you got to be true to yourself you know who's overrated who that lou black lewis i think  he's overrated i don't think he's funny i said young guy that's my friend that's my opinion i saw him  on a couple of specials i'm saying uh jesus christ i said i don't know he's to be that funny funny this  guy funny funny i'm not a guy i don't dislike those but if he likes what i don't like when i say  fuck him i'm not worried about it i wanted to understand not everybody likes me not everybody likes  anybody so so what's your advice to the young comedians to be to be true to yourself though 
[00:52:30]  or you know what i mean like you could you could see the difference we we have a lot of comedians  that come in here okay we know the guys that are actually naturally funny and some of them have a  funny act there's a big difference and then some of these guys are mechanics mechanics okay i don't  know the terminology but so what do you what would you say to young comedians what not to do your homework  they won't worry about and he'll know it because he's been in that era don't worry about i don't  go on first or second hole or third hole i said how about honing your craft the fuck you worried 
[00:53:00]  about if you go on first second or third you're a baby you're a you're a small little kid yet you're  learning fuck when you go on second or third let the guy once you go on third let him worry about it  you learn learn because automatically they'll say come here you you're going on close you're a  fucking strong guy but they're all fighting out or when i hear a comic i'm funnier than him how the  fuck he's on television guys because you're stupid you're worried about who's funnier than me and  funnier than me that's me while you're cleaning spittoons you asshole do your homework learn out 
[00:53:30]  there if this young man can teach you something go this is a great business but we're in a dangerous  business comedy is the toughest fucking thing in show business even opera which is supposed to be tough  don't come near comedy because we got to get laughs every couple of seconds when you start to see a  guy get laughed every five minutes trains are going from you understand this is what what's happening  comedy has changed music has changed i passed the hat on to these young guys who were wonderful 
[00:54:00]  don't put nobody down but i can smell when a guy my dentist right you do me a fucking favor drill the  fucking teeth when you drill the fucking door i gotta tell you a story you tell me one more  fucking story i don't want to hear about it hey pat let me tell you i'm going to start to do stand  sit down or go someplace else i don't want to fucking hear about you you got no fucking talent  hey pat i gotta ask you where do you get your balls from be serious for a moment where do you get  these big fucking balls from like i'll tell you why i respect you you're one of the only guys that uh 
[00:54:30]  didn't kiss howard's ass and you were still able to come back many many times and that was so  refreshing the year but i come in here with respect i don't dislike you two guys i don't i don't think  that at all i like him no no no it's not all i'm saying is like i got us as i'm a kid you're not  worried about how how you're going to be no uh perceived i i love that and listen to me but where  does it come from listen to me when you can tell your mother and father cut the shit don't you dare do 
[00:55:00]  that to me i'm a fucking human being right why should i worry about saying about other people why should i  say hey who the fuck are you yeah but it's rare you don't see a lot of guys like you you take on  everybody and you're like you know what if this fucks my career who gives a shit is a curse you can't  be honest they don't want to hear it woman says tell me the truth pat am i heavy you're fat you're not  fucking heavy will you do me a favor stop swallowing i don't fucking you stay skinny if you turn around  and don't shit you must shit you must go out and pee when you pee you are the luckiest person i know

[00:59:00]  times they roast people who aren't funny so when they go up at the end and they have to roast everybody  back they suck so they want to roast a comedian who can roast because at the end you're going to  go up and blast everybody and that's the way to close the show and another thing i say i i'm 78  years old they say pat can you get up before in the morning and do this show i get up because to  me that's important you never know who's listening on the other side you never say well he's not a  big radio guy oh he's not a small you do it i tell some guys i gotta get up it says jesus 
[00:59:30]  guy wants to be there at 3 30 get up who the fuck are you that guy's asking you to do his ready  show well you know force larry king me oh larry king i know i understand you want to do the fan  and sam show no i'll do anybody's show why not hey listen to me why not i did reagan yesterday i  did i told you i'm still i'm still doing it hey i don't do letterman no more because letterman  doesn't like me because letterman when i said to let him he says what do you do for a hard ass i 
[01:00:00]  realized dying and i kept telling him it's for pleasure to die he didn't know how to handle it  he didn't know how to handle it and i said this is my last i was there three times this is the last  but that's okay i'm not angry at letterman god bless him he did a great you there for 25  fucking years now leno sweat sweating he's there 14 years they may push him for conan o'brien who gives  a fuck they are pushing him for conan o'brien but uh leno's like fuck that and he's only looking  to go somewhere else he doesn't want to leave it's turning out if they if if they turn around  and let leno go how do you turn around you let a guy that's batting 500 give me a fucking break 
[01:00:30]  i mean that's terrible they're gonna push around brian is not they may be 11 30 to 12 30. he may  not be that he's not there's nothing wrong with him he may not be that but somebody says i think  that's the future how about fucking today and don't worry about who you're going to  fuck 10 years from now you may not get a hard on they don't understand that so you're dealing with  guys who are in business trying to make a great moat movement so we push leno out as and he's  number one in that time slot that's what's fucked up about it listen before leno so what does leno do 
[01:01:00]  well leno see leno doesn't want to leave that leno would rather sleep in that chair and leno has  proved that he don't take a day off he doesn't and you know still does his gigs on weekends absolutely  he's insane so he's a guy that's a winner what the fuck you know if it's breakfast if it ain't  broke why are you trying to fix it so you want to push conan o'brien in nothing against conan  o'brien he's not already guaranteed he's going to do exactly what leno did in my personal opinion  before leno i thought letterman should have been the should have been the guy but that's only my 
[01:01:30]  opinion meanwhile let him prove me wrong and meanwhile let him prove me right also he's excellent  so what the fuck you're going to do what are you going to do what happened i lost you there  you get lost a lot of excellent all right we're going to take a break pat cooper uh well uh  i'm serious stay stay stay sit down what time you're off the air uh 11. you're doing that long  yeah yeah yeah cut it down to 10 30. tell us about it pat said we have to go home at 10 30. we're 
[01:02:00]  going home at 10 30 today we're doing it down to 10 like human are you going to the roast yeah we're  going to be on the dais we're not allowed to talk because we're not comedians like you said so we'll  sit there and listen don't get himself i don't recognize that i'm brushing it's just that i got  a bad fucking memory sometimes pat let me tell you something though uh and i don't go out much so  this is a big thing for us we we usually say no to everything you're on four o'clock in the  fucking that that's one of them but we usually don't go to these things why don't you do one  show why do you have to do two fucking shows because we're like jay leno we're stupid you're not 
[01:02:30]  like jay leno you're selfish you're not competitive you're in your own boat no you don't want to put all  our eggs in one basket with this business i think i think it's got a company merging you  got company that you can't say uh the n-word anymore you can't do this you can't do that so  that's another thing so we we don't know where our careers are going you know there's a merger going  on milk commerce big howard fan not a big fan of ours because what we did to howard so we don't know  if we're going to be part of the merger you did nothing thank you pat exactly why don't you go tell  mel that you know what i told howard that you know i told i'll tell you what i told howard what's up with 
[01:03:00]  the dentures i said howard you want to know the truth you made them bigger you didn't hurt them  because when they're screaming he's screaming at you he elevated you guys that's way to open  empty wisely fight sometimes a great fight like that makes him bigger let me tell you something  i'm going to say something here like i try to get a little serious moment out of you but i couldn't  all right i couldn't accomplish about it but i will tell you this howard stern played right into our  fucking hands right into our fucking hands we were the small guys in new york and we're like how do you  get attention you go after the big dog and then you and you can't be scared to go after the big 
[01:03:30]  dog you can't go after the big dog and and in a in a way you got to go right at him but why do you say  that about me then you know i'm right you're absolutely right you just said something that  made me think of something i'm like i'm giving you props that's exactly i will give howard props  for making us bigger but he was he was stupid to play right into our hands that's exactly what we were  going for i said we knew we had the talent but we also knew we needed to get uh attention out there like  you said right and that's what we did we're like howard in his backyard we go after him and we did 
[01:04:00]  well and he played into it you know the old because he couldn't take it and we're like well  as he's not taking it he's making us bigger well don't you know the old story when you after the  big guy you're getting you know you get attention you can't go off the guy that nobody knows about  exactly that's the way it is but you know something it's it's it's it's it's helped both years of  course so what's the big deal because i said howard we're not going to be here forever  so if they're the new guys that's the next but i thought what's who gives a fuck right i mean  i feel he's the next generation if he stops talking about uh big pussy lips though i didn't mean that 
[01:04:30]  because he doesn't look like he has any feelings  an old-school guy we have a different take on certain things  no i'm not doing it all right listen we're gonna take a break i'm happy he liked the rest of the  special i'm actually impressed dude pat enjoyed honestly they're supposed to play it again they're  supposed to play it again they will give him a dvd oh i don't have mine today i would hand you mine  i would get another copy yeah give pat cooper your dvd jimmy he's a busy man he's watched your whole 
[01:05:00]  special he sat down and watched it he was just too tired there was only one play he are you selling  that out where you work uh not yet the dvd deal they gave me is not that good area what selling where  you are what because you're asking the audience who say pay fifty dollars to see you then you want  say twenty dollars for your album as they're walking out the door now you're asking the  the people to pay seventy dollars to see you and i think it looks amateur night when you're standing  there like the smothers brothers they sell wine they sell yo-yos i says you know what i don't know 
[01:05:30]  why don't you sell pussy necks for christmas you've never seen what is this a mall you've never seen a  bigger amateur i stand there and whore anything i'll park your car if you want to pay me that's all right  nothing wrong with that but then jimmy gives the personal touch we give the personal touch i think  that's important when you have a fan base very important i'm serious but i don't like to go out  in the lobby and sit stand there and start saying you want my album you want my  shit go on the computer and get it if you don't who the cares because i'm not into that i gotta sell 
[01:06:00]  i've seen guys sell i told you everything i've seen a guy come off the show sweating like a bastard  running in the lobby so the people don't run out there like a carnival barker i got him with me  screaming at people as they walk out buy something okay now listen to me here's the old trick if you  buy say 50 000 of your albums yeah okay that's registered that you bought 50 000 of your albums 
[01:06:30]  now you claim you only sold 10 000 albums the government says where's the other 40. they're  coming out to those guys right what the guy the guy in brooklyn bought 10 000 boxes for the pizza  boxes and he said he only sold 3 000 is this true they said where's the other fucking boxes is that  really true that cooper bought 10 000 of his albums if he sold 5 000 that's all i saw where now you  show him the closet there's the other five thousand you better show him the other five thousand they got 
[01:07:00]  you're by the fucking ball okay all right listen we got to take a break you're listening to the  worst of opian anthony it's the worst of the opian anthony show on the virus  serious xm bad your breath would smell with a fucking moose load in your gums  dry it'll be all pasty it'll probably dry out like fucking milk does you imagine a  fucking a firm angry moose load that's fucking dirty foreskin on your chin 
[01:07:30]  fucking god damn it clip the moose cock sliding past your eager lip as opposed to the clipped  ones exactly there's no jewish moose no just got a yarmulke on that head with those antlers it would  look silly big antler it's got moose milky film on your teeth yeah it's a fucking keep brushing and  brushing can't get it off you know when you're like you get your gums and all of a sudden like  uh a layer of skin decides to shed oh man i had i had a good one yesterday i think i i took out my 
[01:08:00]  my the top layer of my whole mouth really it's like oh it's such a great feeling what you know morning  breath how your mouth feels when you first wake up your mouth is like oh god i hate that it feels like  three seconds after a moose just gives you a fucking mouthful how come animals don't seem to care about  morning breath because they shit outdoors without wiping the fuck is that i don't know their idea of  marking their territory is shitting and going there from here over to here it's that's mine they don't 
[01:08:30]  have sense enough to fucking shit somewhere they're not going to step in it they sleep in it the  fucking awful animals suck i would love people just to kill all animals and laugh at them  fucking dummies the only animals that should live are ones that actually take paper and clean their  assholes we should leave wet naps out in the woods and any animal that uses one to wipe his  asshole lives is saved but anything that shits and then just walks and shits on the back of their  ankles can go that includes aphids and eagles too dude a dog will walk around with his with his own 
[01:09:00]  shit on his paw for days of course he will he doesn't give up trying to get a cake cake piece  of shit off his ass with that tooth thing they do where they go and then they lick and chew more  make that their upturned nose like they're growling only they're chewing on themselves  and then more licking of their own shit off of themselves wonderful give mommy kisses 
[01:09:30]  all people should enter the woods with arrows just fucking kill every living thing  everything that's alive that shits should just be fucking executed stupid animals  holy holy and we don't even clean them up just leave them there as a lesson to the other  shitters we know what we gotta do we gotta build toilets in the woods and if you're caught not  using it or drinking out of it you get your fucking head decapitated oh i love pot talk monday 
[01:10:00]  how long ago did this smoothie get here about four hours well has it been like two hours yeah  you know i've got to say kenny informs me of when the smoothie has arrived oh boy if it's just  sitting there he's too busy moving like really heavy stuff that's a hot smoothie you know we're  gonna we're gonna end the show at 10 i had a dilemma less radio always good yeah less radio to go home 
[01:10:30]  and move your shit not not good and incidentally this smoothie is nice and warm so it has a better  taste but i'm sure the same viscosity consistency as fucking old marvin the moose with putting the  hooves on the back of your head treating your mouth like a moose pussy oh you have to go to the park  ranger and report that a large animal just mistook your mouth and throat for a moose cunt 
[01:11:00]  try to explain that one with your dried out moose cum mouth yes excuse me sir  could you turn your head when you speak to me you smell like moose cum he'd know as soon as you  said help help me he'd go he got you didn't he smell it you'd have fucking because i bet your moose  seed is really gooey it'll probably hang off the back you have a like you have to be clearing your  throat like you're just like a milkshake the worst of the okay anthony show let me make an amendment 
[01:11:30]  yes an animal that we shouldn't kill any animal that has like no hindquarter hair that shits because  there's nothing but the fucking shit to cake to if there's a smooth ass animal and it shits smoothly  and there's no hind quarter legs and hair i'm sorry no hind quarter hair then it should be allowed to  live even if it doesn't wipe no because it probably doesn't have it can't wipe oh you're being reasonable  now maybe i don't know there's no fucking it's got hooves or some creepy things that are good for 
[01:12:00]  scaling trees any animal that rubs its ass on bark as an attempt to wipe because it's seen people i  think bears do that all right then bears have seen but bears have so much hair back there all they wind  up doing is smearing it all over their ass they're just they're just they're just trying to be like  people just trying to record some production that's why they wander into our neighborhoods they're  trying to assimilate we keep shooting them making rugs out of them they don't know any better they  think when they see when they see a lodge with a bear laying in front of a fireplace and people 
[01:12:30]  fucking on it they think he's part of the team do you think the bears is yeah now see pot talk  continues uh you think uh you think the bears are are coming into our neighborhoods because uh  they could be the first bear that gets along with us yeah i mean the first animal i think it's  going to be like we're going to share everything right right we want to be a part of yeah part of  the human race they want to drive cars they're ready they're like look man we're done with the woods  and stuff we yeah we want to drive cars we want to get a job i want to have kids we want to wait at

[01:49:00]  thing to an 85 year old broad yeah decides to take out a younger opponent and takes her 60 her  ring her wedding ring that she wore for 60 years 60 years of love and and and the papers are going nuts  the uh the voice of the people going nuts everyone's writing into the papers oh yeah people are outraged  something about when old people and there it is and there there it is right behind you i'm just  watching her getting slow i don't understand the last hit because she reaches for the she kind of 
[01:49:30]  reaches look at her she's leaning forward oh yeah oh oh granny goes down  oh and people get confused when they listen to this show trust me we are outraged we all have  old relatives this is not cool the worst part of that is the way her head her hair like like she  like was shaped oh it did it totally dead yeah and i guess she she was it was supposed to talk to 
[01:50:00]  uh detectives yesterday but she had like she had to go to bingo or canasta or something yeah and said  she didn't have time she didn't want to miss her canasta or her card game now grandma i might feel a  slight sting that's just pride with you remember in the fifth your ass goes down very good very very  good old bat five thousand dollars wow to the person that turns this guy in so now is that going to be 
[01:50:30]  added to the cash added to the uh total are they going to report that on the news now that it's uh  what eighteen thousand i don't need i don't need this to make the press i'm just saying five thousand  five thousand dollars to the guy that turns this creep in no problem no questions asked i'll meet you  in an alley and i'll give you a bag of money bring him to the show first huh bring him to the show

[01:51:30]  which doesn't make it any any better obviously but he was just kind of toying with her that wasn't  like that guy was an animal that wasn't the kind of punch you would give somebody for giving him  like some soap chip instead of some crack then he would have walked up and like knocked that guy's  head off still punch her in the face it's an old lady punch yeah looks like jimmy stewart how do you  punch her anyway but but you got this column i'm going to read bill gallo and and others if you saw 
[01:52:00]  this guy face to face you would crap yourself face to face you look away lock your doors but it's  pretty much what we were talking about yesterday everyone likes hiding behind their computers with  fake names and screen names and stuff but the reality is if you're face to face with these people you're  trashing on the computer you would crap yourself yep you absolutely would bill gallo in uh the daily  news today he's he's a legend he's a legend he's been writing for who knows probably 10 years 
[01:52:30]  i would guess he's been writing for 65 years he's in his 80s is he in his 80s he's in his 80s  uh the headline like picking on old ladies punk punk want a piece of me oh look i dry gristly piece  of me look we're all pissed off and you know and bill gallo's a terrific columnist but stop stop you 
[01:53:00]  got you got to know your limitations please stop and then again it's embarrassing this article is  embarrassing to read you know this lowlife who has been mugging helpless old women whoever you are punk  i'd like to meet you in any boxing ring and see if you're interested in a fist fight fisticuffs  first of all if you're really brave you should meet him in a vestibule somewhere uptown yeah then we'll  see how tough you really are boxing ring and then he's perusing the newspaper too he thinks this guy's  like a gentleman like i'd like to take you off your smoking jacket and give you a sock to the face right 
[01:53:30]  engage in some fisticuffs it goes on i'm over 80 now jesus what what are you what are you going to  do he's over 80 and he's going to take on this like 30 year old crackhead ready for this i i think  wait 60 i think i nailed it been writing since 1941 wow this guy wrote about the war and the war  great war the big one he wrote about world war ii ending ww two oh he wrote about it starting yeah

[01:54:30]  just take these guys like they all run at him at once like it like like the bugs bunny cartoon you  can bet that that that yeah that that's not knocking out old people knocking out old columnists jack  lalane will step up and i'll just punch him in the face there's no way an old guy is going to do  anything to that guy god bless bill gallo but stop already and go ahead uh and then the next line is  just hilarious allow me to be the first and then he writes i did box in the pal as a kid and continued 
[01:55:00]  to mix them up later in the marine corps during world war ii but it was all in sport i've loved  boxing all my life and taught my kids to throw jabs hooks and right crosses after the war i still  sparred with friends in gyms until i was well into my 50s but i've never gotten angry with an opponent  with an opponent i'm not a violent man but what you did to these two wonderful old ladies has  gotten me madder than a wild cat wow he is mad are wild cats really mad no they just go hungry 
[01:55:30]  if that's them being mad or not here's the thing can you imagine let's take this a step further yeah  let's say how do you organize this like let's say this guy comes out of hiding and says look i'd like  to take that gentleman up on his offer to fight him do they really promote the fight like yes  corner is the thug and in this corner and you see he's 85 and he's like i really have to fight this  guy yeah right he'd be like um i was writing a column i really didn't mean this i uh look i'm

[01:56:30]  ah well into my 50s but i've never gotten anger okay i'm not a violent man but what you did to  these two wonderful old ladies has gotten me madder than a wild cat in the last 40 years or so of my  life i don't ever remember being so damn mad as i am now 40 years this is the maddest he's been are  you kidding what about 9 11 you yeah how about that you dope how about the nazis yes thank you  fan he wrote about the nazis that was more than 40 well he did say 40 years okay oh yeah perhaps you  know all right boarding on okay so it was 60 it was probably 67 liberating concentration camps 
[01:57:00]  and then this how about blacks being hosed down in the middle of the streets he wasn't that didn't  bug him obviously uh come out from hiding come out and take my challenge oh god  oh my god  he knows what's ten thousand dollars for the mugger if he comes out of hiding to take  wow now you're offering 10 grand for the mugger if he comes out of hiding just to fight bill 
[01:57:30]  gallo fight him promote this one don king could promote it uh huge i want to see bill gallo savage  in a boxing the guy won't let up because the ref is trying to get him off of him and he's just  overhand writing his head just pow pow because there are people all over this world that do this they  hide behind their keyboards and stuff and look he's mad he should be mad but stop with like  like putting out a challenge in a uh in a newspaper that everyone's reading how about a ufc fight not 
[01:58:00]  just ball jujitsu mixing it up you could kick him in the face what's the old cod you're gonna do  and you know what there'll be letters in the paper uh in the coming days we we got to look for that  of people going bravo to you sir you are a man of courage oh it'll be in tomorrow's paper so make sure  we take a look at that yeah uh you are good for nothing and you just you deserve the beating of  your life come on out you rat and let's get a look at you do you think she's really going to give him 
[01:58:30]  the beating of his life no i don't know i think this guy's probably been in a few brawls probably had  the beating of his life a couple of times like in his crib he's in his 80s he's in his 80s yeah do you  think this guy right now is watching the news going i can't believe i hit her like that yeah wow the  purpose gotta be nervous man when the whole when you're constantly on television oh yeah  like a hundred year old lady you're gonna really bug your city's looking for the entire city of new 
[01:59:00]  york is waiting for this guy to get caught it's it this story is just huge it's it's it's got uh  it's got legs as they say yeah now there's stories about old folks uh um you know getting into self  defense oh they're taking self-defense they kind of always show this whenever an old person gets  assaulted they show old people at self-defense classes and you just look at them and go just stop it  just stop you're a victim you're a victim it's like a wounded zebra going to a class at the little 
[01:59:30]  side of the pond yeah it just ain't going to save you when the lion comes charging at you at 40 miles  an hour yeah exactly now make sure you scream real loud when you throw your punch that'll frighten the  attacker that's her little hat goes flying when the attacker grabs her from behind she tries to use the  mover she flips the attacker but instead she just enrages him so he picks her up by her throat and 
[02:00:00]  throws her through a window here we go uh here's what was on the news the self-defense ladies old ladies  taking self-defense watch grace wilson in action and you forget she's 82 years old you don't the  self-defense class she's taking involves short but powerful moves for seniors that use an attacker's  momentum to gain control of an opponent oh sure because they're in their 80s they're supposed to  start we're using the cane and feeling sorry for themselves wilson's attending the class after seeing 
[02:00:30]  this disturbing attack caught on surveillance video watch as defenseless 101 year old rose marat  gets pummeled in the face not once but four times by a mugger how about this how about all the old  people in that building instead of wasting their money on their self-defense how about they all chip  in and get a doorman yeah there you go there you go a gun oh no here he comes where i gotta remember  my self-defense cause yeah 
[02:01:00]  i don't know  dummies come on it's kind of dangerous to tell your grandma to take self-defense take them on when 
[02:01:30]  she's never done anything like that in her life before just give it up apparently she got that  knockout blow because she leaned over her walker trying to get her purse back yeah maybe you should  teach uh the old broads what to do in a situation give up everything give up your 30 dollars and  your you know your lotto tickets yeah don't worry about it teach you want to pop those teeth out and  provide a service here's a little more to the audio you know be a scamp now i don't know how to use  self-defense but if i was taught i mean i would try to defend myself the best i can the glenwood senior 
[02:02:00]  center in ridgewood is starting classes for elderly members who want to feel more secure  like grace wilson she offers to demonstrate her moves on me some 30 years her junior after promising  to take me down gently i realize she is not as frail as she looks since i'm taking these lessons and  doing what i'm doing honey he get his kick right where he don't want it there you go oh honey honey  the old lady kicked to the the balls he get his kick right way my mom oh people all right i don't see 
[02:02:30]  oh oh oh oh stop hitting me i'm trying to fall  oh they're gonna try to throw a kick in there hip is gonna crack like ground crackers 
[02:03:00]  trying that flip move oh just collapse to the floor like a fish that has been thrown into the sand  you just lay there until you're rescued this is the worst this is the worst  who will be at the virus serious xm talking about this uh 101 year old lady that got punched by the 
[02:03:30]  uh the mugger in the in the vestibule everyone has seen the video by now it's just everywhere it's  worldwide by the way yeah people are um commenting that it's uh it's all over the place yeah people  love stuff like this a lot of pressure from the nypd to catch this guy a lot of pressure they'll get  him sooner or later somebody knows who he is yeah well you turn him in five thousand dollars from me  personally not from our joint account anthony which we zeroed out anyway because we don't trust each  other well you got it you know i'm sure john lennon and paul mccartney had great times 
[02:04:00]  anthony and i we have this corporate account for whatever show expenses and stuff and  we notice it gets a little too high and we both called bob secretly bob it's a little higher  every so often it gets a little fat and we're like that you want to divvy that up you want to  want to move that into some individual accounts police we got to move some of this i want to stay  pretty liquid but um i might may want to invest no it's not that i don't trust anthony but but um you 
[02:04:30]  know keep like ten bucks in there ten all right five bucks we both do the same thing it's hilarious all  right hey uh letters to the editor about the old lady who wants to take this over here  love these all right i highlighted some of the good ones myself you did yeah well go ahead and you  do you start highlighted yeah you start go ahead uh well i like uh the first one i don't know how 
[02:05:00]  anyone could possibly think that a goon like this could ever be rehabilitated hold on hold on what's  important to this anthony because we see the same crap with our radio show everyone likes to comment  about what we're doing wrong with the radio show and they hide behind screen names they don't use  their real names this first guy is really brave because his name is news n-o-o-z guy one news guy  one yeah let's see how brave you really are write these same letters with their real name and the first  and last and your address and a cell phone number get a knock on the door yeah by a guy in a uh hooded 
[02:05:30]  jacket uh he could have killed both women and the fact that they were so elderly and infirm infirm uh  makes it all the more vicious give him the needle give he's being tough he wants to give the guy a nice  easy death penalty i like this one yeah which one p-n-o-bronks 
[02:06:00]  damn and and she spelled damn d-a-m idiots from the bronx why lots of whys that wasn't right at all  when i see the playback on this i was not too happy but what a what a risk taker take this poster is i  was not too happy i was not too happy why that is the worst thing i've seen in a long time how are you  going to punch her not once put about four to five times and he couldn't put her down he had to push 
[02:06:30]  her to the floor and then in capital letters you go grandma i wish i knew who this guy was  or rather i wish i was walking down the block when that happened no you don't why no you don't i mean  you think that while you're behind your uh keyboard but no one wants to see this animal face to face for  the most part uh brooklyn kid it's a shame before god for someone to do such a thing jail is too good  for this poor excuse for a human payback will come in spades for this fool well yeah oh well where's 
[02:07:00]  the one where they want to throw the book at him yeah oh phantom this was a dreadful attack on the old  and feeble i watched the video clip on the news last night i was absolutely dismayed i think the book  should be thrown at this guy throw the book at him 1950 talk the hell does that mean throw the book  at him uh what other ones you want to read really fast here how about bronx girl 74 bx grl 74 typical 
[02:07:30]  that's all i that's all i'll say on that oh you gotta love her typical huh first thing i thought  when i saw this on tv i was so angry i hope the police catch this and then capitalize animal soon  jail time should be life with no parole for this animal ooh it's like this guy doesn't know jail  here's a t-y-s-e-n-s 13 another person hiding behind their screen name instead of using their real name 
[02:08:00]  and this is for the this isn't a wacky uh message board this is in the in a respectable uh newspaper here  in new york uh it's a long letter but uh this line uh caught my attention i hope they catch him and  turn some of the seniors loose on him with their canes walkers whatever and beat the crap out of him  like clockwork orange one of the old people are beating alex yeah diamond lou has a good one the 
[02:08:30]  only question is where's the big mouth al sharpton now why is he not crying for justice now it is  interesting how not one black leader has stuck their stupid face out to make a remark not even  comment on it not even commenting who cares yeah um jailhouse doc it's my favorite that clown is a  punk coward plain and simple let him go against someone who could give him a run for his money and  his skirt would drop right down if he gets locked up the other inmates will form a conga line on him 
[02:09:00]  and he will have hemorrhoids that no amount of preparation h will soothe this guy's kind of  painting a picture isn't he hopefully he will be caught and even the crooks and protective  custody on rikers will make his life unbearable he's not even talking about the criminal he's talking  about that kid from american idol and then on the line did you see dr phil another person hiding behind  their fake screen name uh put me in the ring with this little fart and i'll show you rocky balboa gone wild 
[02:09:30]  he'll be walking like an egyptian for a few decades and then he ends it with uh the a-hole yeah but  he spells it arse a-r-s-e yeah blah blah blah get into quite the donny brook with the guy huh yeah if  you want some entertainment uh you know go read the letters to the editor in your paper  the rocky thing yeah i hope the guy would wind up like mickey but rocky he probably would too but 
[02:10:00]  rocky balboa isn't real that's exactly what the scene would look like if that idiot columnist there  what was his name bill gallo yeah uh if he if he uh got in the ring with this uh beast it would look  just like clubber lang that's some bitch slapping mickey  ah rock  i'll i'll get him rock 
[02:10:30]  here he is come on get in the ring  and rocky wants to help with all time but uh yeah but mickey's like no i can handle this one rock  i can handle it you just sit there and watch what i do to this punk i'll get this punk we'll  fight fair and square come on punk put up your dukes 
[02:11:00]  hey vicky  he brought a shovel into the ring rock  he's caving my skull in rock  don't worry i can handle this one  oh my head looks like oatmeal 
[02:11:30]  i don't think that's allowed in the ring sir  apparently it is i just like the visual of him taking them on and rocky's not allowed to do  anything because yeah he just thinks he can handle this punk  go on mickey uh he's picking me up oh no he's ready  oh  whoa  oh god rock 
[02:12:00]  he's just waiting for the for the call  come on come on let me get in there let me in mickey maybe i can help you out with the guys  no i'll handle them rock i'll handle them my wool cap is full of stool but i could  oh oh oh oh  i don't think that's what you want to like do the horse toys too i need coconuts he's running 
[02:12:30]  me over with a horse rock  rocky he's running me over with a horse  oh no rock he's picked up a dolphin  he's hitting me with a dolphin 
[02:13:00]  ow  not a sheep  we're not even close to the water how's he doing this  what do you mean is it safe 
[02:13:30]  he's drilling my teeth rock  rock he's drilling my teeth  ow  oh  now he's offering me some oil of clove rock  just say the word  no i'll handle him rock  you just raise your hand or something 
[02:14:00]  no not that  that gentleman again  i just love the visuals  just raise your hand and i'll help you mickey  he hit me with a horse rock 
[02:14:30]  oh no  what's what's he pulling out of his pocket rock  i'll get him if you want  oh no i got him  he tased me rock  just say the word  i got your back  i got him rock  not a problem  i've chased chickens i can beat up this big spade 
[02:15:00]  you want a piece of me  you want a piece of me that's exactly what it would look like  with all these people that are brave enough to take this  on  80 year old columnist is going to beat up this guy  oh man is that  very funny  why would he hit him with a dolphin  like people would just accept that and watch it like  like here's the thing that the dolphin would have to be sitting somewhere for him to grab it  like no one would question why there was a dolphin by the side of the ring 
[02:15:30]  but he's just pummeling the old guy with it  yeah he picks up this endangered animal and hits an elderly man with it  with his gloves on how do you do that with your gloves on  i don't even know how you'd hold them they're slippery  let's go to larry on long island  larry hey what's going on larry larry  morning morning quick thing before i get to my question to you guys  uh as far as senjaya patrice has totally become a queer 
[02:16:00]  there's no way of defending that when you sit there  panalyzing and titillating about some young boy who's under 18 nonetheless  yeah it's just his theory is just kind of funny yeah  that's all it is funny it is funny and he's real straight anyway um  so well my question was when they do catch this guy yeah how much time is he  really going to do for stealing 33 bucks and not even using a weapon well  is there like a law for people that are over like 65 is it like worst punishment  for that oh uh you know uh funny you should mention that and no  lie yes as people like to say but uh they want to make it a felony 
[02:16:30]  if you uh mug uh someone over 70 years old to assault them apparently it's a  misdemeanor to punch uh an old person in the face  right so uh the guy really you're right the guy wouldn't get much time and the  lawyer would plea bargain it down and it would be like hey look he he's got a  drug problem he was high on dope and he's uh  cleaning himself up they they pull out all those usual crap uh  i think fences i think the age is too low though man there's 
[02:17:00]  70 year olds can be tough right i think if it's his first defense he's  probably going to just get honestly honestly he's not going to get much time  in the end but then everyone's going to know who he is and you know his life is  just going to be hell but uh here's the law they uh the new york legislators  proposed a new law yesterday that would make it a felony to assault anyone older  than 70 and hit the assailant with a maximum of four years in the slammer so  they're trying to get that passed i think they should actually go at 60 um  because all like that's the difference between that like regular hate crimes like 
[02:17:30]  everybody will be old if we live long that's not a black thing or a gay  right and that's every person will live long enough you're going to be old i  guess that's everyone equally they prey on the uh  the elderly so now they want to you know protect the elderly by having this new  law so it's pretty interesting you should get more than four years too man  if you punch an old lady in the face like that you should get 10 years that's  brutal i mean he really just like clocked her until she fell down  he had her money he had everything she leaned over to grab  her bag i guess he could have just like mushed her you know just could have given a 
[02:18:00]  mush or yeah leave the building she probably had just a little birthday  card in there for her great great great grandson or something and that's all her  her day was going to be was trying to get to the post office and mail the damn  thing she'd like to handle money for church yeah yeah for that like like what  you do when she went to grab the purse he could have just raised his hand up like  he was going to slap her and she would have backed i mean that's what i always do  like i'm trying to get in line there's some old people like hey you're just like  like you're gonna backhand them and they back right off yeah they understand all right great 
[02:18:30]  thank you guys you guys are the best larry thank you all right hey uh really fast this  saturday at uh bro's restaurant yeah all right we're doing saint patty's day uh  i i was there this weekend and and he wants to start the festivities at like 11 30 in the morning  that's good but we're doing karaoke later on in the night we're doing like saint patty's day  karaoke we don't really have to promote this because it's a small place but it is going down  just want to make sure people know that oh yeah it's going to be uh packed believe me it's uh it's 
[02:19:00]  the restaurant i own with my two brothers brett is the you know he's it's really his place we're  just like silent partners that hang out and just kind of make sure everyone's having a good time but uh  it's 400 new york avenue in the heart of huntington village fh reilly's this saturday what's wrong  there jim these scumbag attorneys this guy who killed jessica lunceford who buried her alive  they're showing like the brain scans of him and a normal person like that should avoid the death 
[02:19:30]  penalty yeah because he raped a nine-year-old and buried her alive and they're showing you the brain  scan like that's somehow going to excuse it or should spare his life lawyers should just be shot yeah  the uh the the defense is saying that he oh he's got the mind of a child no he doesn't he took the  life of a child that's uh that's about it just kill this guy already if this guy doesn't get the death  penalty we're just doomed just give the father an aluminum bat and if that's what the family wants 
[02:20:00]  and allow that'd be great to chain this guy to a chair and just kill him yeah change the chair first  the ankles work your way up the groin question on good morning america should kill or get death oh  yeah uh yeah yeah yeah he raped and burned an annual live i think that pretty much covers what the death  penalty is for better alive it's horrible actually convinced her to get into this bag by saying that  he was uh get into the bag so i could take you home that's what he told her and uh got her to get 
[02:20:30]  into this bag close the bag up through in the hole and buried her so she was completely alive and  conscious did he say why he did that uh no he won't say why won't say why he said he said he was scared  he didn't he actually broke into the house meaning to steal things but then on an impulse took her  and uh you know that's an impulse so then you rape her and then uh throw in her bag and bury her alive 
[02:21:00]  and they found uh the but when they dug her up they actually found that she had poked a few fingers  out of the bag yeah i mean they just the worst possible crime you could think of you can't even  fathom a more horrible crime than what this guy did and you actually have to contemplate whether he gets  the death penalty this is a kid what if this guy doesn't get the death penalty then there should be  no death penalty for anything ever how can anybody anybody think this guy has any redeeming value as 
[02:21:30]  a human being we absolutely have the right to squash this bug what's prison going to do if he's got the  mind of a child then he's not going to appreciate the full impact of the horrors of prison it's just  going to be uh him sitting there uh uh going like an idiot so kill him just kill him get rid of him  what do we gotta what do we gotta make believe we're so civilized and above that what are these  people that just think oh no that you know the taking of a life uh for another is just as bad as 
[02:22:00]  the no it isn't no we're not that civilized stop it it was just a very short time ago we were just  throwing spears at each other could we just put this guy to death and i hate that goddamn lethal  injection hate it yeah make the death penalty as horrific as it should be as it sounds as it said  yeah the death penalty yeah it's not just going to sleep yeah has anyone had you know an operation  or anything where you had to be put put to sleep for a little while is that like horrible you don't 
[02:22:30]  even remember it you get a needle put in your arm and then you're waking up only this time you know  you don't wake up yeah but but it's just over what's wrong with a firing squad or a guillotine  why is that so considered so barbaric i like yeah i like i like a cage on his belly with a rat inside  the cage hungry rat and the rat is really hungry or they also have the uh you lay down on the cage 
[02:23:00]  with the rat and then you um heat the bottom of the cage so the rat has to eat through you to get out  of the the hot cage yeah yeah that's a good one that is a very good one yeah we saw some of those  medieval tortures at some way i think it was some renaissance fair no i think it was like spooky world  or something i don't remember where we were but yeah i was in massachusetts all right they would do  that they would heat the cage with the rat to eat yes so the rat would have to eat through yeah we  didn't just make these up we actually saw these and they swear this is what they used to do back in  the day they would get a hungry rat and put a cage on your belly with obviously no floor to the cage so 
[02:23:30]  your belly's the floor of the cage and the rat would just start eating uh eating you away what  about the um the metal cone it was like it looked like an ice cream cone made of metal and it was  turned upside down pointy side up and they would lower you down on top of this thing till the point  um made a contact with um a place in your body that is usually meant for uh things not to um go into 
[02:24:00]  right and and they would lower you down onto this thing and as you got lowered down of course the  diameter gets bigger and bigger and bigger until you just get ripped into pieces what are you not  confessing in that situation but what information what information is so valuable that you're tolerating  that nonsense that god i've never even thought of it that way you are telling everything everything 
[02:24:30]  everything all they have to do is go do you see that cone and you go is that what i think it's for  and they go yeah and you go get a pen yes i will write everything they want photos everything no problem  coming what is going on this is the worst of the open anthony show serious xm so anthony wants to be uh  a furor i'm sorry uh well not quite a furor i think that's i think that that the word has bad  connotations to it it's not like you know i'm just thinking a true leader this country what this country 
[02:25:00]  needs right now is a true leader we are in a very bad situation as far as the world goes um we're like  the world police but anything we do gets criticized by that world and they don't understand how important  our being on this planet is to the stability of the planet we are under appreciated  the euro over there in europe they're getting their own economy going and they're saying screw 
[02:25:30]  you and the euro keeps going up and the dollar goes down china's hoarding our money they're uh using up  all kinds of resources uh the russia isn't this um a friend of ours anymore they're always poking at us  for whatever we try to do france don't get me started germany same thing like they haven't tried  a couple of shenanigans over the past uh century or so what about the irish the irish irish in england  have been pretty cool but i'm sorry they're gonna have to suffer also really yes because this plan 
[02:26:00]  is very very direct and very uh easy here's my plan if i led this country first of all i'm sorry congress  the senate all those people they gotta go they can't have any input on what i say i am like making the  rules i can't be bogged down by red tape and meetings and and hearings and all this other crap 
[02:26:30]  that happens because it's just partisan bull that just divvies up the nation and waste time and nothing  ever gets done so uh i have to be in charge just let him go let him go he's on a roll then go ahead  what we do yeah all of our military that is spread around the globe making uh every other little  uh crap country safe yeah pull them back pull them all back every single soldier that belongs to the 
[02:27:00]  united united states military gets pulled back to the united states of america we then get a giant uh  uh uh build up of troops on our carriers on our destroyers airborne  marines everything and we go to uh-oh uh-oh here it comes venezuela venezuela we attack venezuela 
[02:27:30]  in a decisive disgusting display of force that in a war that ends in a day we take over venezuela  no one likes chavez there's oil there up the ying yang solves our problem can we make a t-shirt  venezuela oil up the ying yang oil up the ying yang work on it brother look we we we then we we take them 
[02:28:00]  in as uh you know like we got puerto rico and stuff we then we own venezuela yeah anyone who doesn't agree  with it or like it down there you're gonna have trouble what do we call it we can still call it  venezuela i got a problem name you said you want to call like the 57 uh it could be like the 51st  state or something somewhere around look i'll i'll let the people i'll give the people like a little  bit of freedom uh to pick a name they can do it like american idol style on tv whatever they want to 
[02:28:30]  do but it solves our oil problems okay and now we're going to get a lot of flack from the world  because they're used to the old u.s the u.s that backs down to all this kind of stuff i get up there  and i give a speech and i tell the whole world look this is the new united states of america  this is what we do we're taking care of numero uno the united states of america and if anyone doesn't 
[02:29:00]  like it and if anyone god forbid tries any shenanigans with this country you will see a use of force as you  have never seen decisive none of this crap where we sit and go and go uh oh we're sorry about  civilian casualties or oh we won't use too many troops or oh we'll only use smartphone i'm talking  devastation to anybody who even tries to interfere with these plans can you add go screw to your  speech go screw yeah that'll be like my slogan right and uh then what's the slogan again go screw nice 
[02:29:30]  then after we uh have venezuela we leave troops there obviously so no shenanigans can start with  any of the surrounding nations and then we we pull again a big part of our military back to the u.s  where we guard our borders no one else allowed no one allowed in you can come and visit if you have a 
[02:30:00]  valid passport from a nation like england those are your perks and it's the only perks we're going to give  you like uh you're from australia you're from england countries we get along with then you're allowed  to come in a little bit and visit but you will be monitored and you'll be asked to leave when your  time is up but this will take care of the problem of us not getting the respect we are due around the  world and we will tell the world in 10 years or so come back crying crying for us to to spread ourselves 
[02:30:30]  around the globe again because it will be utter chaos around the globe without this country being  policemen to uh the rest of the world there will be countries beating the crap at each other and we'll  sit back and if people think these nuclear nations these budding nuclear nations are going to uh uh uh  perk up and do something people will be warned for every nuke that has attempted to be sent over in our 
[02:31:00]  direction a completely devastating nuclear strike will uh come against their country where they will  just not exist anymore they won't exist so if you want to do that because we're the big boys on on the  block but no one seems to want to realize that or give us that respect that we are due as a nation  that is saving the globe right now why do you think other countries aren't running in and invading other  countries all the time and and taking resources the us of a we become pussies all right i gotta come we 
[02:31:30]  need a strong fist the fist i got a couple problems what what party are you going to get elected on this  is a no party the parties will be dissolved there will be no republican or democratic party it's got to be  one guy that takes control and me and now i have to lead this country oh i will once once everything 
[02:32:00]  is in place i will give up my power yeah yeah some other leaders said that once everything's established  i will give up my power is it true that you want to get rid of the mighty dollar uh well that suggestion  was brought up uh in exchange for the dollar the new denomination called the kumia will be introduced  to the economy uh that way and what does that solve that solves the problem of goddamn china  owning all our money oh okay now china can whip around all their useless dollars with the old 
[02:32:30]  presidents on them but we'll be printing up the kumias the the one dollar kumia the the five dollar  coming and and that's the money you spend and we spend it amongst ourselves what do we need we need  wood we need wood uh we go to our forests and we get wood uh venezuela's got some wood uh we take that  as a little perk from our oil thing we take our wood and then we pay people in kumias to uh uh make the uh 
[02:33:00]  lumber and then our cars we we we get uh iron we got all the resources we need here in this country  why outsource things the country would be so employed and so prosperous under my rule now uh  can i be on like uh something yes all my friends will be on my like committees i will not i want to  be on like a like a dollar bill or something no i mean they're called kumias but can i like be the  face of no my face has to be on all of them you can maybe get the back of one somewhere like you could 
[02:33:30]  get the back of one on like a little picture by one of the buildings by my chancellery uh the white  house uh and jimmy can be there but but this this is what we the times right now are calling for this  can i be uh in charge of the national cereal sure i'll put you in charge of the national cereal national  breakfast cereals yes it is a great plan for jimmy for a great yes hold on i was just joking but if 
[02:34:00]  you're going to be like the furor and the money's going to be the kumias yeah what do you got for  little old me jimmy will be the head of the ministry of comedy your job will be ticket because let me tell  you no it's a very important job because the people when they're ruled under an iron fist of one leader  tend to get a little edgy they tend to get a little like they want to kill the leader sometimes 
[02:34:30]  your job will be to find comedians that can then go around the country and keep people laughing  keep morale up during this uh these tough uh initial times until this plan kicks in and people love it  i'll produce 30 films with bill engville do it it's on you read the review on a sitcom too oh boy  uh uh what about me opie you will be nice minister of communication oh button push now you're not 
[02:35:00]  button push your job will be to uh does that mean i get to push some you know you're in charge of the  state-run real things radio now all but it's i want to be the official button pusher for every button  how about this what fcc dissolved there will be no fcc you you will be the voice of the nation nice and  you could then delegate that responsibility of course under you know my approval to whatever 
[02:35:30]  whoever you want to hire of course  yes and uh the comedians as minister of comedy you cannot mock the fur the president the leader me  hey you can't mock me i can't be made fun of a lot of people suggest suggesting that i should be on  the penny at least um what do you mean no e rock is saying no what the hell is he going to be in  charge of minister of nothing he's there so that the people the public can look and go my god it can be 
[02:36:00]  so much worse i could be him yeah you're an example he'll be the pro-choice face right hey we got  syracuse checking in this is a very very rare thing uh steve in syracuse what's up hey what's  up fellas how you doing good steve yeah i came up with a great idea while i was washing myself in the  shower yeah diabolical laugh tuesday he's going to be an evil ruler he needs a diabolical laugh yeah we're not 
[02:36:30]  evil we need the official uh diabolical laugh  hold on hold on hold on tim take that and make a uh a sweeper please immediately there's there it's not  evil this is a plan that needs to be put in place diabolical laugh tuesday diabolical sounds 
[02:37:00]  diabolical this is a plan that is needed in this day and age america is divided right now the world  looks at us like we're a bunch of uh uh uh jackasses we get we don't get the respect for all we do for  this planet i'm raising my hand now that's the only way we're allowed to talk at this point um how about  we start slow how about we start like our own society like uh nope the opie and anthony society 
[02:37:30]  can't be or how about we build our own city because the government we built this city the government  then sees that as some kind of threat and this has to be done immediately i don't know how i think i  just gotta ask they could say no and then i gotta go with plan b what's plan but i'm just gonna ask  uh uh uh the president and uh congress if i could just do this  if i could just you know hold on step in it's diabolical lab tuesday 
[02:38:00]  the way to start to gain power is you go home to home and you slaughter  all families found to be in the possession of plums okay that could be a good start  i just think it's time someone is suggesting maybe we should just try to get ourselves on the  front page of uh the xm radio website before we attempt to get on money that's a good idea  words maybe if i if i offer yeah the present government yeah 600 billion kumias 
[02:38:30]  oh just gotta print them up nice maybe they'll be like wow now when the government changes over to  just me being the leader should we ever take venezuela should we have a contest like someone's  gonna like you know invent the kumia now uh the design we accept the design all right all right all  right i think uh some of the message boards uh i know there's a lot of talent over at the whack bag 
[02:39:00]  on the photoshop section uh could you design the kumia and then we want to print it up and sent to  the station yes i want a stack of kumias i have an idea that the kumia should be it should be a horse's  ass and the denomination is determined by where the tail is pointing i may be insulted minister of  comedy no no the horse is a beautiful animal oh okay yeah yeah yeah and it feels just like a person 
[02:39:30]  apparently all right all right we're on to something i like that that's just you know  something a lot of people with a lot of uh complaints and questions and stuff i'm the only  one delivering uh an answer a concise answer to the problems of this nation god you were doing all  the heavy lifting last night i was reading jimmy's happy endings book see you're getting real things  done i'm i'm just enjoying a nice read i'm an answer man whether you like my idea or not it's an  answer so all the problems right every problem done yeah what what steve well we all know yes

[02:41:00]  wear one of those ankle bracelets we give out the felons now oh that way you can track them  everywhere they go and think of the economy wow that's diabolical wait wait but we interrupted you  and i think oh did he hang up oh he was so he knew he had a good that was diabolical i did interrupt him  a little bit i'm not going to be the minister of marshmallows ray didn't the communists try this it 
[02:41:30]  didn't work i'm not talking communism here my friend you're talking about an entire society  turning inward and solely relying on itself i'm not asking for everybody to pitch in for uh just you  work and give me all their money and i'll divvy it up amongst the american dream will still live  capitalism within uh ourselves uh will live live on people that will be rich there will be poor who  might have to be you know taken care of uh and by that i don't mean given a bed and uh three squares 
[02:42:00]  being used for fuel uh apparently well we have venezuelan oil so perhaps we can labor something i  don't know but we'll find something for them to do we're talking more of a utopia right but isn't the  american dream predicated on people from outside if you use the word predicate again it was let me tell  you another thing i'm gonna get up with a chisel and reword some of that stuff that the lady in the  harbor is holding on that book cover it's not gonna be a welcome sign anymore i think it works and and 
[02:42:30]  the people agreeing in droves this is very encouraging for me very encouraging are we allowed to take a break  because uh opie you are the minister of communications it's your call see i i i i am i am soft and gentle  when i need be so i still have a little power of course you do you run the entire communications 
[02:43:00]  of the united states of america official button pusher official button for all for all  jimmy you you are the minister of comedy could you remind people of this help make the people laugh  minister of comedy is now there it's my whole plans coming together right in front of your eyes i love  this i'm the official button pusher jimmy's the minister of comedy and iraq's doing nothing this  is going just as planned well as per the generosity of president kumia um he has demanded that all tickets 
[02:43:30]  only ten dollars so that all people can come out and enjoy the comedic festivities aren't the up is  the public applauding these these uh things don't we have uh uh the public why don't we open the windows  so the people that are gathered outside can listen to uh jimmy uh giving his address uh and his speech  and perhaps listen to the public reaction yes let me uh uh uh president kumia wants all people to enjoy 
[02:44:00]  comedy comedy for ten dollars thank you thank you but he has said this will only happen in boston detroit  washington dc and pnc and home dell new jersey wait he has said also philly 
[02:44:30]  and he has said that philly will continue until friday  i am generous because according to him there are less jews in philly  well i don't know where that came from if you're comparing me to somebody else  oh jesus what's that smell this is the worst of the opie anthony show  on sirius xm brought me back to being a kid and you go to camp or something and you hang out with 
[02:45:00]  these people for like a week two weeks and and you think like uh you went through the nom together yeah  and it's just a week of playing you know dumb sports and canoeing and crap and making pottery on days  it rains and then your parents come and uh and then you say goodbye and and even as a little kid  you realize oh no i'll never see these people again i'm real sad i'm real sad yeah yeah i'm  extremely sad this is i don't know what this means but but if you really step back and think about it 
[02:45:30]  you know especially if you went to camp as a kid it was only a stupid week in your life  who cares if you don't see these people ever again i went to summer camp so it was longer than that  it was like you got to go all summer yeah it was pretty much the whole summer at what was called  uh the paul bunyan day camp uh when i was living in central islip paul bunyan day camp babe the blue  ox wait was it on long island yeah yeah so you didn't even go get to go away no we had to take a 
[02:46:00]  bus there but it was just like it wasn't that far it was in the middle of the woods somewhere and  the counselors were all a bunch of like just pot smoking dope fiends so you took a you took a bus  a couple exits down the highway to camp yeah yeah on a summer camp you have to like you have to go  over a bridge and and start going up the mountains and stuff no we came home every day  it was it was day camp you didn't even get to sleep sleep over with all your no 
[02:46:30]  with all your hormones going crazy in your body no no i i i think i was a little young for the  hormone things going crazy but oh my god it was uh yeah it was day camp so we take a bus there and  and then they bus us back that's like that's summer camp for poor people if the poor people we tend to  live in clusters right yeah it was uh it was real boring too like after the first week they ran out 
[02:47:00]  of stuff for us to do and we didn't have a cool it wasn't a cool camp with like canoeing and and archery  and things you see at like cool camps it was pretty much you either played softball or or like soccer or  kickball outside but when it rained they took you inside where you made like ashtrays out of clay yeah and  that was it nothing fun about it that's retard kid it really was my mother just sent us there because 
[02:47:30]  she wanted to like have fun a summer and she didn't want the kids around what do you mean by  what do you mean by have fun probably have sex with multiple partners uh i have no idea i don't know what  she was into back then she was being groovy in her culottes i don't know it was uh yeah so she just you  know sent us all off to day camp that was that i mean it sucked i did a little of that uh day 
[02:48:00]  camping too and sent yeah camp alvernia i think it was called i don't know the one on the on the lake  down by the lake well uh on the harbor there instead of port it was moose lake it's closer so i made that  assumption yeah the one that's right by the lake there with the uh because that that's one that they like  it's a a camp for for nannies i think all pairs i don't know this is going right by centerport i  used to take my jet ski by there and they would all lay out topless because that's what they did 
[02:48:30]  in europe and they were all from like yeah sweden and stuff oh yeah so they'd lay out there and you  saw nothing but like these puttering uh jet skis doing circles and i was one of them  thing could do like 60 miles an hour on the water and i'm just doing like a mile and a half in front  of this place of course you got to of course you have to place is legendary went to camp when i was  a boy my mother said when i was 13 i didn't want to go and i remember we were such dorks that one of the 
[02:49:00]  guys thought it'd be cool if we all pretended we were dead when the counselor came in  so we all laid out like we were dead what what was wrong with you i don't know yeah i just played  along you just did not have a normal childhood jimmy so you guys were playing dead because you were  because you heard the rumors of this guy touching kids probably and that was the only way to you could  think play dead yeah play dead so he didn't uh you know violate you no he was uh he was young he  was like 16 or 17 he was young a young dude he wasn't like he was like one of those guys 
[02:49:30]  because for the summer and how old were you 13. perfect summer creep perfect for the hormones  that are raging through your body but you uh you you what did he come in and wake you up every  morning no but i forget what he walked in and we all just pretended we were dead like what did it  work no of course it didn't we should have been no watch out these guys are nuts did you put ketchup  around your neck or something i think someone did do that not on my neck but yeah we were just we  we were and what did he posing hacks what did he do just dip his lunch into the kid's neck no 
[02:50:00]  there were a little extra ketchup the worst out was when he walked in he heard the of the screen  door and he looked around and then just nothing and you thought it was going to be so cool when he  went oh my god they're dead there was just nothingness no the dorks had to just get up and go all right  well it had no impact let's say hi to scott on long island what's up scott hey guys how's it going hey  hey hey i i went to that paul bunyan death camp myself oh you did i did and it was no picnic and 
[02:50:30]  anthony don't you bs what was no picnic well well i i i know what do you have to add to this  oh they they the uh the instructors they throw you in a pool whether you knew how to swim or not  if you didn't you know if you didn't get to the front and back you know you wouldn't get no lunch  they throw you in the woods and they take off and leave you in there for hours hey yeah that  happened to me oh yeah it happened to everybody it really was terrible i got tied to a tree um 
[02:51:00]  and then this big fat counselor took his big meaty paw and and smacked my stomach till he gave me pink  belly where you just go bam bam bam and then left me tied to the tree that's that's what you remember  from that incident yeah you blocked out everything else i hope so i hope it stays repressed forever  wait why did you that because they were all a bunch of i've used to you know use the scum word 
[02:51:30]  uh and that's what they were they were just uh a bunch of low lives that were put in charge of  these kids at the day camp well who else is going to do that job in the summer i know like they're like  cool kids were like lifeguarding and caddying and doing all that other stuff that was kind of cool  it was a crap uh day camp that had uh the worst counselors ever i remember that guy he he was  like i think he was russian or something and he had this big like meaty wrestler hand big fat 
[02:52:00]  mitt and he would he just like smashed me in the stomach as i was tied to a tree he tied me to a  tree tell your mother yeah what'd she do she didn't care she had a date she was wild back then wild i tell  you probably with him she probably paid him to do that to you all right thank you scott all right try 
[02:52:30]  to bring up some memories oh yeah thanks it's all on your death camp they called it the paul bunyan  death camp yeah let's we arrived in box cars let's say uh good afternoon to cleveland uh what's  up ray so i used to go to a day camp out out here um a suburb of cleveland and it was the worst  camp i've ever been to in my entire life the counselors had no control of the kids they thought  they did but they never did you had counselors picking on kids putting them down 
[02:53:00]  all that stuff so i really relate to what anthony's saying about like camps and stuff  yeah i think we all pretty much went to a camp growing up oh yeah and why do you you didn't  need to control the kids let them be let them be wild it's camp camp huh i used to fight all the  time with kids it was amazing yeah there were a lot of fights they were you know there's a bunch  of kids being bussed from central islet to this paul bunyan day camp so uh there was a lot of trouble  a lot of racial uh uh trouble back then even when you were like 12 dude it was central isolate oh 
[02:53:30]  yeah yeah and we'd be on the bus and and it was just like the the black kids controlled the bus  at 12 years old yeah little skinny white kids we're just sitting there like oh boy don't mouth off  don't mouth off oh oh why did i get smacked in the face i didn't say a word i didn't even eyeball  them you would get smacked yeah occasionally you just just as one guy was walking by you get smacked in  the face and they'd all laugh and go as they walked that's sorry as they walked to the back 
[02:54:00]  of the bus oddly enough you know uh they they had the freedom to sit wherever they want but wanted  to sit in the back so they could pull shenanigans on the poor little white children of central islet  face yeah yeah it's a lot of slapping stories i was constantly being slapped and crying that was my  whole childhood anthony poor me thank you jimmy punching bag i was so just abused doesn't it does 
[02:54:30]  explain a lot though the mental abuse and then like we're finally seeing where the seed was planted uh  jimmy and i have so many like regrets that i remember in my head like little moments that probably could  have been happy moments that i just didn't do the right thing or something there was i was in central  islet and uh it was a lot just a lot of racial trouble i i it was i guess it was you know during  the uh early 70s and um you know the races weren't getting along very well back then and uh blacks were 
[02:55:00]  coming uh out onto the you know this new sense of uh empowerment and it was time to get back at whitey  yeah uh so you know us white kids kind of had to stick together and everything but we never did  we never could and then i remember one time there was a little white girl named um uh her name was  dawn it was kind of grossed me out a little because that's my sister's name there's nothing worse than  like being in love or lust with a girl that's the same name as your sister i've said just the opposite 
[02:55:30]  and in jimmy's case it allows him to just relive uh yeah the fond memories and i would just i i was  telling i was telling people how i really liked this girl and yeah and um i guess the word got back to  her and and i was sitting at my desk and we had this thing where we all had to make these little little  um kind of like a scenery a little scenery thing of uh thanksgiving or something 
[02:56:00]  so i made little pilgrims and everything and set them up and glued them to some construction paper  and and did a whole nice thing and and then they brought in other classes to to kind of look around  at our thing so i'm sitting at my desk all proud of my thing and this girl dawn comes by and um and  she looks at me and she must have gotten word that i liked her because she looked at my my stupid little  construction paper thing and then looked up at me and and gave me this smile and i swear i had to be 
[02:56:30]  probably nine years old at the time but the smile she gave me i still remember it was one of the it  sent like like chills down my spine and i was like oh my god oh jesus and she kind of like looked at me  a little more when she walked away to the next person's stupid display that was probably a friggin bodega  or a crack dealer so i i was sitting there thinking this is great and uh i'm gonna talk to her dude i 
[02:57:00]  never mustered up the the balls to say a word to her and then it was just you know she goes along her  merry way i had that one moment of a smile and i i was i was like hey it's it's 80 000 years later and  i'm still regretting not talking to this girl at nine years old where's she at now i'm probably  dating one of the black guys absolutely well she's probably dating a pilgrim that had such an impact 
[02:57:30]  on her i turned her off to white kids no go get them gumption idiot that i was but that might have  changed your life see the good thing was if you would have talked to her you might have dated her  and then had self-worth and you never would have been funny you wouldn't need it to be funny you  might have changed the course of your life you might be right little that little dumb kid might  have recommended you would have had five kids by now too it could have been they could have changed  you know that is odd that there's that that little that might have been one of those forks in the road  in your life and another situation happened in california and i talked about this one uh a while back 
[02:58:00]  when uh i was in school and this girl very cute girl was at her locker and she's bent down getting her  stuff and some douche just kicked the locker door and hit her square in the head and and she started  crying and i was like three lockers away and all i wanted to do was go over there and comfort this  crying girl that got her head smashed by the locker and again just what a pussy i couldn't muster up the 
[02:58:30]  the confidence that a girl that just got her head smashed that if i gave her a little comfort she  wouldn't just reject me so i'm sitting there and i uh should i go should i moment over moment over  idiot just shut your locker go to class and regret it for 50 000 years are you um having a nervous  breakdown no no this is the stuff that keeps you from having a nervous breakdown you just vent it all 
[02:59:00]  out it's just memories of your childhood uh that like don't go away and for some reason it's odd that  they stay with you uh so vividly for so long but those are the things that made it makes you who  you are makes you who you are because then now the way to get the girl is make her laugh is do this so  that stuff kind of goes into making that stupid that big-headed chick at the locker who probably  deserved it and the one who would have hated you after two dates anyway not talking to them did change  the course that made you who you are you never would have been as funny as you are if you had that 
[02:59:30]  kind of self-esteem there was no need for you to be funny guess so the girls liked you because you had cute hair  you would just rely to get stupid hairdo let him let him vent though man oh but i mean i relate to  him it's finally uh he's finally venting getting this getting this out yeah getting all this crap out  it's just this i had an awful childhood let's be honest there's so many stories like that but i just  saw it was though but but i wanted to have a really good fun childhood so i did like with myself and a few 
[03:00:00]  friends and stuff like i i think of a lot of times that i enjoyed i had a lot of fun growing  up as a kid did you ever enjoy your dad but they were punctuated by yeah i enjoyed my dad a lot but  with this reservation with this impending doom feeling uh because it was just like being around  him was a lot of fun but there was always this element of danger like i always felt like uh i could  be killed at any moment either killed in a horrific drunken wreck or shot accidentally or starved to 
[03:00:30]  death or uh thrown from a horse there was always just this element of danger that he felt um in  order to make me the the guy he wanted me to be he had to put me through this training course  that uh put me on the brink of death many times so it was kind of odd and i definitely enjoyed it  uh 12 through 16 man around those years i was thinking of your dad when you were talking about  that thanksgiving display mm-hmm how long did that last when when you brought it home oh who knows he 
[03:01:00]  was probably having sex with his gomar up in uh connecticut jesus what's the matter joey yeah uh because  he used to fill a vending machines that was his job sure it's like uh uh where were you oh connecticut i  i don't remember your roots being up in connecticut i had to pick some stuff up oh did you why did it  take two days uh joey don't think don't think i'm stupid joey i know what's going on shut up bro

[03:02:00]  you got that that lame stomach ache thing it's a stomach ache and i couldn't because men don't  get stomach aches it was a tummy ache and and and he would turn around and go you don't have a stomach  ache and and you wish you could just like project yourself as an adult into that kid to go  yeah you're right i don't i said i have a stomach ache because you two are ruining me you're just  yelling it doesn't end it doesn't stop could you just leave each other so we can grow up in an 
[03:02:30]  environment not filled with hate there my stomach's put the pepto away mom the stomach's fine you two  are jackasses and you're destroying your children that was uh 30 some odd years ago you really should  get on this you really should just get over it well i have a question wow i want to ask it seemed like  yesterday when i was saying it no kidding now you saw this girl after she smiled at you did you see her 
[03:03:00]  in the hallway all the time and just be afraid to walk up to her yeah yeah i didn't even make eye  contact after that well that's that's normal crap though dude it might be normal crap but everybody's  an individual so to me it was like it's not normal but and then there was didn't what was her name  oh my god uh diane i think or denise or something and and uh she was in the apartment complex that i  lived in in central islet and we went down in the basement and uh and uh kissed in the basement yeah 
[03:03:30]  and i was like wow that's pretty cool you know uh first time i ever did that with a girl with a  little girl and um then she uh takes off and uh then i see her with uh this kid named keith doing  the same thing yeah that's just normal like a little slut but it adds up yeah but it's normal  crap to be scared to talk to a girl when you're growing up i used to follow this girl home from uh when  i was in junior high i had a massive crush on this girl i don't want to say her name i would follow 
[03:04:00]  her home i would keep my distance and and and it wasn't like i was stalking her because a lot of  people walked home i want to know her name no way why it's her first name only of course but what's  her name no it's all right it's not frank is it no it's not right and um i i was never i was never  brave enough to to uh to walk you know completely up to her i would keep my distance and the whole time  i'm like come on you could do it i would have these conversations with myself you could do it  and i would start walking a little faster i'd get a little closer still pretty far away still a couple 
[03:04:30]  hundred feet away and then i'd back off and have almost like a panic attack and i never i never  told this girl how much i uh i liked her yeah never did it but i i followed her home for a long time  so you remember those things oh yeah and they like jimmy said they all add up to make you the person you  are but all that's normal crap we could do an hour on this yeah but i was constantly doing it  it was a part of my personality that i couldn't like i couldn't make the move i had no confidence 
[03:05:00]  as as a kid to uh interact with girls in that way you didn't want to confront anything  well because your parents well maybe but i just didn't have any confidence and i think that was  from growing up in like that that household that environment was probably not the most conducive  to building a child's confidence all right we uh we have to take our first break no we can't  i'm in the middle of a crisis i want to hear more of this when we get back oh absolutely 
[03:05:30]  jimmy yeah very interesting stuff anthony is finally venting and we'll uh we'll continue  i've vented about my stupid childhood for years that's a little different oh god you're like you're  like a 13 year old kid today yeah yeah you're having a nervous breakdown this if i was like a 13 year  old kid i'd be in the bathroom doing what 13 year old kids do by the way if you're gonna have a  nervous breakdown make sure it's might make sure it's around 7 30 because that's 7 30 that's when  we have our biggest audience all right all right you will let us know if that lamb takes a look at  your little display won't you we got kelly from michigan she wants in on this discussion i don't know 
[03:06:00]  kelly kelly leak wasn't kelly good morning guys yes it's a she she's a broad hi kelly hi what's up you  you know what i thought this was the dr phil show the dr phil show yeah did i tune into the  wrong station well it's uh venting a little bit possibly he's getting close to a nervous breakdown  i'm thinking i don't think so i'm just kind of you know uh remembering remembering inventing and not 
[03:06:30]  even like uh memories coming out of nowhere this stuff i've remembered my whole life i look back fondly  on a lot of it uh it's nostalgic it's very wonder years ish but um you know how it still affects  you so like you still get that feeling like you'll think about that girl looking at the thing and that  smile still means something oh it was so it was so sweet and nice i was thinking about uh you know  the girl i would follow home during the break and i as soon as we went to commercial i told jimmy uh the 
[03:07:00]  name yes and and then i realized why didn't i just say the name on the radio yeah her name's uh  well yeah i'm still scared of saying now and i heard her first name's ann but um because i think it  brings you right back like oh my gosh she might be listening oh geez i could give a call i could  give a crap about this girl i used to follow home but it brought me right back because anthony it  reminded me of something and i was scared to say her name because i'm thinking she might be listening to 
[03:07:30]  the show and i don't want to know what she really thinks of me oh it was 20 some odd years ago or  whatever it was that in that time capsule where where whatever it was right when you fall at home  uh like junior high i'll call you older than like seven right okay you like oh no i was like 13  home last week yeah last week right i follow her kids home now  all right kelly thank you you can have it is time to get over it oh uh i'm you know something the 
[03:08:00]  truth of the matter is i'm really over uh a lot of stuff it's just um there there are kids that went  through a hell of a lot worse than i did uh these are just these are just childhood moments like ope said  a lot of kids go through the same things but it affects you and kind of not so much now you're not  sitting there uh now still freaking out over anything but it kind of made you who you were  you kind of bounced off of these events when you were growing up and all through your life you you 
[03:08:30]  bounce off these events and it kind of guides you down whatever path you end up at uh the end of  and uh you know those little moments are one thing and and it was directly because i didn't have  any confidence to go out and and really you know assert myself and and say hey i'm sorry you that  idiot hit your head on the locker you know let me let me let me rub the bump on your head you could  rub the bump in my if it's any consideration hold on to the guys that would have walked up to her and 
[03:09:00]  comforted her or smiled back and went i'm glad you like my little project and there are plenty of kids  like that yeah none of them are funny yeah almost none of them could make anybody laugh it's a total  lack of confidence that you just have to start making stupid jokes it is a desperate reach for  love it's a plea for attention of course it is it's like this is what i have to give you here here 
[03:09:30]  but you know what 35 years later whatever it's better to have that than a stupid high school football  jacket which you would have gotten who cares over the glory days they ran for 65 against central  bunch of douches so good for you not to say hi to her who we are central jimmy puts things in such  great perspective remember the big win over central look man it's weird it's like but i think of the  girl that i liked when i was a kid i picture i still have a feeling for her but i don't picture her as 
[03:10:00]  an adult i picture her yeah exactly a fourth and fifth grader like i had that little pic image of  her like in the school picture that's how you think so yeah it's still very affecting yeah there was a  girl um that i really had a huge crush on growing up and i did try and she wouldn't give me the time of  day and then you fast forward many many years and i'm at a high school reunion and this girl is completely  following me around the entire time loving my ass loving my ass because of who i am now 
[03:10:30]  oh you know what she wants the uh he was fortune i'm like you know what go go f yourself  and i  go f yourself how old were you when you liked her honestly from uh kindergarten all the way uh  uh for for most of high school okay i would keep going back to this one girl like wow man and we 
[03:11:00]  uh you know when we were in kindergarten in the grammar school we we would talk we'd go to each  other's house you know nothing big no kisses none of that never got to that but always had something  for her and man when i i went to this high school reunion a few years back wow yeah wow and i'm like get  lost you don't you don't think i i see this coming do you know that it's how it would how it affects  you this i i was kind of in love with this girl when i was in fourth and fifth grade whatever and 
[03:11:30]  now i look back on it and i realized that she didn't like me as much as i liked her and i remember  going to her house one time and uh we were going to hang out and then her and my friend kept going  down to the basement they're like just wait up here so i was like okay and i waited up there oh oh no  oh oh god years later in high school he told me like yeah that day she and i were downstairs making  out and i got this is you know it was years later i didn't tell him i got angry i knew that made me a  kook but i was like so angry and it's like i don't trust women and that's probably why you were the one 
[03:12:00]  girl i really liked all of a sudden i never want to be the guy that doesn't know right like the guy  that's like yeah oh my god i thought i never want to be the guy that has the revelation and realized  he's been made a fool of right right i look back and that day god you were innocent jimmy and she's  downstairs basically losing her virginity or what would be your virginity at that age  oh stupid non-kissable chapped lips so that's not crazy stuff no it really isn't there's hey  there's uh one more one more of these uh hard little stories of no confidence or anything and 
[03:12:30]  and not being able to see my hand in front of my face uh before i left to go to california um i'd  been living in huntington right behind um fred's diner over there uh oh knows where that is and um  there was this uh girl leanne me and leanne were buddies from the time i moved in there as as a kid  growing up into like you know pre-teen dumb kind of junior high-ish age around there uh and uh before 
[03:13:00]  i went to california uh i was like all right take it easy and stuff we'd always hung out and i was  really just in love with this girl um and then i went to california and i get a letter from her  and it's just her writing i can't believe you you left uh i'm so in love with you and she was  circling where her tears were hitting the page as she was writing and and i'm like i'm an idiot i'm 
[03:13:30]  three thousand miles away now i'd have like you know i'd have stayed in new york probably  if it was uh uh if i knew how this girl felt and we hung out like every day well did you like her  like that yes but i we hung out all the time but i was just in an inept complete lack of confidence  douche who couldn't see like what was going on i thought we were friends and i never wanted to  make that next step because i i didn't want the rejection or i just uh didn't have the courage to 
[03:14:00]  do it it's just you know an ass how old were you and show you that letter uh 30. no  it's always funny to say you're older it makes you seem silly i love exaggerated humor probably 12  or something like that when's the next time you start after that oh man when i came back from  california and then forget it you know everybody's just having their own good time and off on their 
[03:14:30]  own own ways and it was you know completely over so but my mother told me she goes uh leanne came  to because when i was on the phone with my mother from california and she goes leanne came to the door  and uh asked where you were and i told her you're in california because i i told her i was going but  i guess i didn't say the day or anything like that and then i left and she goes and she just started  crying i was like oh that's odd and then i got the letter i my baby she wrote me a letter  wait did you ever see leanne i have to know what happened to leanne yeah i i saw leanne after that 
[03:15:00]  because i i had kind of came back from california moved into the same neighborhood but i was at the same  house tell you the truth she still lived like across the street i moved into the same house  after i came back from california went to the same school and i come walking in and there's a  big difference between 12 and 16. so i came walking in and people were kind of like i think i know this  guy but i'm looking around going i know you i know everything about this person i know this so 
[03:15:30]  i'm kind of walking around because i disappeared from the face of the earth for a few years uh  according to these people so but they were different people too you know they were all older  and uh yeah i kind of picked up with old friendships but for the most part just made new friends  leanne i kind of talked to her and stuff but she was in her own crowd she ended up being like very hot  uh so she hung out with the you know hot girls and perished the thought i i approached them i'd rather  stand in the back hall in my army jacket smoking pot with guys uh wondering why there are no girls around us 
[03:16:00]  where's leanne now uh i don't know you don't want i don't know can i can i be honest where's leanne  you don't want to know where these girls are now no probably not i think it helps sometimes though to  kind of like to kind of not feel bad about them when you look at them now and you go oh yeah they're  middle-aged women heading toward menopause you really let's be honest with each other we have  these memories of what they used to look like and what they used to do for you i don't want to know  where these broads are no i'm saying that's good with regret though if you have regret if you look at them 
[03:16:30]  now it's like yeah how can i regret that look at you you're a pig look we got everyone fooled they  think we're in our late 20s early 30s oh really some of the girls we dated are heading toward menopause  at this point it's right over the over the hill it's right around the bend i uh i got it there was  this girl i mentioned it recently on the show um when we talked about long distance relationships and  i just am convinced they just don't work whatsoever because i had one when i was going to geneseo with 
[03:17:00]  this girl she lived in utica and we wrote uh letters all summer long back and forth i got a  stack i just remember this a stack of letters from her still tied up in a bow or something at my mom's  house i'm gonna bring them in and i'm gonna read uh i'm gonna read a letter or two oh yeah because now  knowing what i know as she's writing these letters she went uh went back out with her uh her ex who 
[03:17:30]  was the star football player for central central she was banging him all summer long while she's  writing me these awesome like uh romantic letters so now i gotta bring these in and read them on the  air wait did she circle other things on the paper right where he had left a little remarks right  my back and it fell on the paper oh she oh she played perfectly she she wrote nice things she uh  quoted uh lyrics from hot songs of the day and uh and perfume on the letters all that stuff and then i 
[03:18:00]  find out like you know later on that she would that the whole time she was banging uh her ex who was  the quarterback of central central behind her and her face was pressed into the paper so hard it looked like  the shroud of touring right i must really love me speaking of not trusting women because now i just  i just assume like like they're naked together and and i'm the i'm i was the joke the whole time  where the guy's like oh you're right this right this yeah like they're writing the letters together  because i was so effing gullible i guess i will bring them in and read them on the air yeah that'll be 
[03:18:30]  fun definitely that would be fun knowing you know what what i know and what the listeners know i'll make  some chills i wish i would have saved like letters and things but too embarrassing there's a girl that  broke up with me that i wrote a letter to and you don't realize till later how just how completely um  impossible it would have been to get that girl back like it was just over you know she had moved on and 
[03:19:00]  you are just a distant memory but you think there's this chance if you you write this nice like letter or  something and it was just just talking about how you know hoping she'll forget that you had sex with  her best friend no it was it was even like yeah no it wasn't it wasn't anything like that moment it was  just like you know it was that it's that time when they just decide you know or you decide yeah you're  just gonna leave yeah it's done you know you're early teens you're in school so school relationship 
[03:19:30]  things and then they just find someone else you know there's one day they walked down the hallway  and go ah okay oh i'll go out with him and then you're just left there so you write your little  letters but we're so made for each made for what at 14 i'm not even completely made yet yeah i'm not  even cooked i'm made for each other made i'm not made this thing uh still needs a few parts still has 
[03:20:00]  some ingredients right but you know what when you look at this low self-esteem and not talking  to a girl when you look back at the times you talked to them and shouldn't have like my self-esteem  being low was justified when i was in high school i liked this girl michelle i loved her and i  couldn't ask her out but i finally had the courage i looked her up in the phone book oh and i called her  and i was like uh hey it's jimmy and she's like hi like and i'm like uh you don't want to go out with me  do you oh there's some confidence she actually was kind of nice she's like no i don't think so 
[03:20:30]  but she wasn't hateful about yeah well you put her in a great position and i think i told you this  right i tried to be careful i was like wow that's that's the way the ball crumbles like i tried to  be funny and saw by by mixing them up yeah yeah thinking she'd go oh wait on the other hand you're  funny oh wow yeah plenty of just embarrassing i should have just my douchey moments my most  self-esteem was telling me the truth all right now that we uh ugly uh now that we got therapy 
[03:21:00]  out of the way we're going to start the opie and anthony show after the break that's true we're all in  our periods yeah we're going to conventionally waiting to exhale in a half a circle  the worst of the gold pete anthony show on sirius xm yeah i know mike uh was coming in as well  oh d stefano's not here yeah he's right there where is he oh i didn't see him where where when did you get  here getting here for a few minutes what's up oh dude i didn't fucking do it happening 
[03:21:30]  how you doing hi sweetie what are you doing mike  you could point to a chair he don't give a  shit he'll sit in whichever one he wants whichever one he damn well pleases we blew up uh me and my  brother blew up a uh a bag of balls when we were in high school with with blockbusters right nothing  we uh i got community service and nothing you mean yeah we blew up with we made a bomb bomb yeah two 
[03:22:00]  blockbusters duct taping together blew up they had a bag of balls in the gym you know like hanging all right  yeah the rubber ones yeah sure blew it up we both got caught it wasn't that big of a deal no they  didn't care yeah now well that was the you know that's a different time yeah unfortunately we were  talking about uh this morning there was a girl that brought a steak knife into school and cut a  little steak and she got in trouble yeah a lot of trouble actually possibly a felony charge now or  something like that jesus yeah because they can't everyone's afraid of being like singling somebody  out yeah you know you know we're growing a nation of weak little douchebags that's what's 
[03:22:30]  going to it's ridiculous yeah while they're attempting to yeah i don't i don't think they'll  succeed because there's no individuals anymore you can't deal with anything on an individual basis they  all got to be lumped into one category and you'll have the zero tolerance policy so that if a kid comes  in with a gun not looking to kill everybody or a kid comes in with a you know spoon with a handle 
[03:23:00]  looking a little too sharp they fall into the same category yeah and they've both dealt with  and it's all it's all based on like one fucking incident that happens yeah yeah you know every  even the terrorist attack you know i don't want to be a dick but it happened to us once in our whole  fucking history you know other countries go through it every month you know and and here it's like  art now is the the orange alert today i heard that today they're still saying that the alert  where are we always are i think uh stop paying attention to the alert thing a while it's retarded 
[03:23:30]  it's just to make us afraid so we'll buy shit to quell the fear i'm telling i think that's what it  comes down to this some fucking i'm not in a good space this week why what happened no it just because  in comedy as a stand-up you know that's really what i that's all i really fucking know about drugs  stand-up and a little bit to crime in my life that's my whole life story crime and uh like this  week there's a club and i'm not going to get into who what where but there's this big fat uh jewish 
[03:24:00]  american gentleman that that just took over a club in times square he took over a club and this guy's  that fucking filth bag he is a scumbag and i'm doing i've been there for three years i kill in this  place i'm i'm kind of blue you know i do my thing but i kill i do what i gotta do and this guy comes in  within a week he has me fucking taking off the scale i can't you can't play early shows he told  uh the booker told me why are they getting pc and comedy club that should be the last place i i i hate 
[03:24:30]  it but i understand radio wise but yeah i don't really understand but i i yeah but i i guess the  there's advertising radio right right you understand why they have to bend over right not in a fucking  comedy club not in the car right there's only two clubs left in new york place they go after  there's two clubs left in new york i'm not going to say the names of them carolines in the cellar  but the rest of them no it's the truth man which club is douching you you might not was the laugh 
[03:25:00]  factory and they the laugh factory hasn't really been douching they've been pretty cool with me  because you know what it is it's a whole it's a fucking porn joint first of all the guy that owns it's a  a porn guy he opened a comedy club with jamie masada from fucking l.a you know don't say n-word  it's on a band yeah i said i said it 50 times the night he banned it i still stayed there anyway the  point is that jamie on a bunch of times yeah yeah we you know we tolerate him yeah yeah you have a lot 
[03:25:30]  of tolerance i mean we we know the same people and all but i don't i don't agree with pretty much  anything he says you've been whatever he's got a little a little too much power there with the  n-word and all that well what happens is uh banning the n-word from a comedy club that's completely  insane jimmy brought up a point you know about the gangs and stuff in l.a but i'm just what i don't  know i didn't mind no you said the funniest thing about not letting black people in the club anymore  that was fucking classic did that's the funniest thing said about when norton said it on your show 
[03:26:00]  when jamie was here jamie was going buddy i don't want to have big problems in l.a we have the riots  and blah blah blah so so uh we banned the n-word it's and jimmy said uh real quiet you know he said uh  he goes instead of banning the n-word why don't you just stop letting black people into the club  and yeah it was just funny but i know i understood because the gang threats he was getting it's almost  like they were threatening to firebomb his club right he's in a really weird position yeah jamie's one thing 
[03:26:30]  you know jamie you could see coming if you give jamie uh if he hurts you in any way you deserved it  right the guy just oozes scum you know what i mean i'm a fucking filth back now now so he was partners  in this club he left wait jamie's not part of that club anymore no no he's not part of the club yeah yeah  it's a real whatever but all the staff there the one thing about them they really didn't they don't know  about stand up which was actually good because all he did was go wow this guy makes everyone laugh

[03:31:30]  meeting after that show i did and i called i said look i have a really important meeting i'm gonna i  can't make the spot tonight well mike there's a new policy if you cancel a spot they take you off the  whole week oh shit so you had a great reason yeah so i said to him well you know zero tolerance yeah  exactly zero tolerance going back to the weapons in school for fucking you know for uh uppity comics  see this is the difference between what you're saying and uh hanging out with jimmy the seller a 
[03:32:00]  lot of big names go in there yeah but you could easily call up uh esti and go look esti i can't make  my spot tonight because i'm going to be on jay leno or what or i'm going to have a meeting with hbo or  something and like that she just says she don't like when you cancel spots but you know what there's  that exactly what you are as a comic that you got other opportunities that you can't blow off but  guys things like uh she's a gate yeah is it really don't don't break my book i'm very sensitive you 
[03:32:30]  guys don't understand people think i'm a tough guy i'm a fucking tender guy i'm very sensitive i'll  fucking split your head with a hammer no but after trying to talk to you i'll try that you'll you'll  split our head with that not your head you know but then you'll feel bad about it you want to hear  afterwards listen i punched the guy once at a show nice and uh oh restaurant row yeah we're outside  the club and there's these two spanish guys standing there like they were waiting for me to beat the 
[03:33:00]  fuck out of me and i don't know what i said to them whatever so one of them standing here the other  ones to my left this guy starts with blah blah blah i said bro i don't come on it's comedy i don't know  what happened the other guy i see him clocking his hand back so i drilled them i would drilled them  this guy was unconscious standing up you ever see that happen it was beautiful his eyes rolled  i fucking went nice in the bar and brought out a bag of ice and put it on his face for him and said  look why are you swinging at me and i'm trying to talk to him that's how i am what did he what happened 
[03:33:30]  nothing he went up that happened they were nice then we were friends and went out for coffee all right  so so this over why don't we call marty can we get marty in the air no he's a scumbag he don't even have  a phone probably he's an animal right so he got but he's out of there here's what happened they called  me yesterday and i said to the kid he i saw his number i said what's up bj i said why are you calling  me bro i told you not to call me unless marty fisher was dead it's the only way i want to hear from you 
[03:34:00]  and he said mike he's out they threw him out he's already starting to embezzle  shit and with the money so they fired him well that's what mike's saying i have no idea and i'm  back there sitting back there yeah so that story wasn't worth telling all is good with you not  really no there's a lot of drama in there there was a lot of drama yeah i like any comedian  yeah club owners and stuff like that hell yeah don't do it so i enjoy that well you probably did it 
[03:34:30]  years ago i mean not oh yeah yeah i mean now jim used to do it with his act you can't have any  self-worth as a comic until you're making enough money right and i just don't i'm not going for that  i can't live like that you know i can't i not that i don't go around arguing with nobody but this  guy you know certain things you can't you don't fucking tell you don't start taking me off the  schedule after three years of killing in that fucking place so now you're back to doing your thing  well yeah now i'm back over there yeah whenever i want you know i'm treated good over there but 
[03:35:00]  when this guy came in i wasn't and that's the way the business is and pete they try to censor you and  now down at the cellar when i first was there the early shows she likes you to be not too rough you  know so sd came to me said mike look i i'm not censoring you but can you tone it a little bit on  the early i said absolutely can i ask you i'll do that that that early show late show crap  people going to a comedy club is there really a difference between the early show crowd and late 
[03:35:30]  there is but there shouldn't be i don't think there is the difference obviously is alcohol  consumption like you get a drunker crowd later but the ones that come early really want to  uh see cleaner stuff is that true i don't know conservative i think a little bit like you know  like you picture your your family's probably go out more likely for an eight o'clock show and  and did i be home by ten so there is some right philosophy yeah yeah yeah i mean later i don't  run a club so i don't know but she's not saying clean she's saying don't do the cunt kicking joke  at 7 30. you know that joke you do when you punch the girl in the cunt on the subway don't do that 
[03:36:00]  can you not do that for me she asked me like you know and i guess manny i never met the guy but  it was amazing spirit of that place is just about stand up it really is and there's a three drink  uh thing there did you know that maximum a lot of comments don't even know that you can't you  can only have three drinks there like that's how committed you are to having a good show really  i don't want people drunk and no parties of eight or more if you're eight or more because  fucking comedy clubs love giant work parties yeah seller eight or more you are not permitted to sit 
[03:36:30]  together yeah that's important because uh they're not yapping yes just yapping i've been to a club  yeah they got two or three tables filled with uh people people they work with and they just can't help  but you tell a joke and then the guy at the table goes hey that happened in the office the other day  remember then they all start talking and shit and it's retarded you know but that is what we do as uh  as uh as uh as patrons pain in the asses we relate to what you guys say up there and we have to elbow 
[03:37:00]  and go that's great that's me me oh it's funny because it's true right right those are the tough  ones by the way to deal with it's not a guy motherfucking you on stage you can deal with  because he's being a prick and everybody knows it but a guy who likes you who's like uh yeah all right  jimmy but there was a guy recently in scranton doing that he meant well he was having fun but it's like  you sir are a fucking you're trampling everything and i want to fucking i want your heart to stop 
[03:37:30]  beating him in a sentence but you know he's not trying to fuck you so you can't hit him too hard  this girl uh the other night i did it well two weeks ago i did this really cute rape joke that i  do for the holidays cute and uh can you tell it it's not even a joke i just said that raping a stripper  shouldn't be a felony because it's like taking extra food out of a buffet you know you paid a certain  amount you took a few extra ribs or something home so so this girl so this girl but they're just 
[03:38:00]  trying to work their way through college mike yeah and i don't have a lot of that kind of there used  to be sluts back in the day but now they're just you know i only do that one girls uh trying to pay  their way through college i do that kind of material just to annoy people it's not really part of my  you know and then uh so anyway um this girl fucking almost was in tears you ever have that  happened jim yeah they're upset they're emotionally connected to what you said and i'm like she said 
[03:38:30]  and she used the word horrifying you guys were talking to you about you said uh what's that no  tolerance policy everyone has their own vulgarity right when i'm hearing people go we have a no  tolerance policy and the asian american community is going to get to get i want to throw up that  language is vulgar to me it's phony and it's fucking vulgar cursing don't bother me you're like bill  car everyone says bill cosby you don't correct yeah you ever get compared why don't you be like 
[03:39:00]  bill cosby and for a finger a girl who stops over exactly i give him a fucking melatonin there you go  so so so so i say well bill cosby doesn't curse this is true i curse like a fucking animal 13 women  accused him of molesting them 13. wow i've done it i've been that's the answer 13. all right let's  what accused him four women accused me and jim we're all allegedly on that one too they gotta  use the word allegedly yeah mike guy well they allegedly and i'm not saying he did it i'm not 
[03:39:30]  saying he did it but after eight accusations somebody you know got to settle with my seat up  people don't care and sean from monroe no no i didn't get a lot in yeah and i think he went home  and he's been obsessing about that since no you know next time i get a chance at that  fucking show i'm gonna show them no well there's only us guys you know i'm talking a little bit  yeah you guys seem to be like you don't really want to work today so i'm fucking throwing the  shit out there i think you've got that right and the last time i was here that that dumb off was so 
[03:40:00]  funny oh you were part of the dumb yeah no i wasn't part of it i came in during it or that show over  at the other space and uh it was so funny we're doing homeless pyramid on thursday yes same type of  thing we lost in them but they're uh we're matching them up with uh homeless people yeah  and then we're going to do pretty much the same game no it was baffling how dumb they are yeah no  kidding yeah at the same time voss ten minutes later will say the most brilliant fucking thing  really when improv in here yeah improv he just said something oh i thought you meant just saying 
[03:40:30]  something no no he doesn't have a good information about things no he's really really dumb yeah when it  comes to just knowledge he's almost dysfunctionally stupid like you're surprised he understands it's  food yeah bob kelly is a different kind of dumb bob is desperate to be technologically bob is fairly  brilliant and he wants to be sort of smart yeah that's why he rehearsed he tries so hard to not  be the dummy that he really is but he's technologically fantastic yeah yeah colin quinn is so brilliant 
[03:41:00]  because he pointed bob out as being a technological bully and and colin was so fucking dead on he has a  carlin like ability to narrow call i mean yeah he's great and colin's like bob is like a techno  bully where like you'll ask him for help and he'll help you he's like what are you stupid come here dummy  like you just have to bully you while he's helping you right yeah colin like the tech guy in the office  good yeah i hate those fuckers fucking bob does do that speaking of voss uh coke logic's video it's all 
[03:41:30]  over the place it's one of the ones you can download from itunes yes and we're we've been number one as far  as uh video podcasts uh being downloaded which is pretty cool but uh he's got the one up there with  rich voss talking about how there were no flavors what until eight years ago or something like five  years ago when did flavor come out he had a whole discussion and he was trying to convince us all  there were no flavors until five years ago like potato chips like mostly potato chips like only five years 
[03:42:00]  ago uh you could start getting different types of potato chips and we're looking at him like you're  you're insane yeah where do you live with this lack of knowledge he's a dumb guy and that's  i love i really love voss he's one of my closest yeah he's a great man he really is closest confidant  yeah but he's he's just a stupid man and it's almost like i didn't realize as years when i didn't realize  how fucking dumb he was yeah yeah you initially think it's some kind of put on because it has to be 
[03:42:30]  because you like that no no there's no way you can be this stupid and walk the earth you know how  you know you can tell he's also at peace with himself yeah he doesn't need there is a little  bit of peace with the man he doesn't care yeah that he's stupid well used to blow drug dealers for  drugs well you know how to get to that point i think he just dressed sexy for everything else is gravy  that's what he said he had a drugs yeah i did a little drugs too it was fun that was fun  you like your drug days i was uh i did heroin that was my thing wow really yeah and everybody 
[03:43:00]  that's like so fascinating to people i never smoked pot i didn't really drink that's fucking  heroin was like heroin was your stepping stone that was my gateway drug to heroin start off slow  and get to her nope you're not supposed to jump right into it went right to the heroin wow  you might be the first person i've ever met that went right to her i grew up around it there was a  a lot of heroin dealers in my neighborhood and uh probably pot dealers too they weren't dealing  nickel bags of heroin they were dealing pounds of it you know how old were you 15 when i did it 
[03:43:30]  first when i started snorting yeah i started snorting and then then they they told me how to shoot it  all right shooting did you have your own works yeah yeah i had my own works and uh it was fun it was fun  it was great it was the best you're insane i can't wait wait i'm all for drugs now i'm all right  i'm all for drugs nine years i don't want to fast forward so you're 15 i'm never going to say heroin 
[03:44:00]  sucks and people say it's like you never if you never tried it it's like having your dick sucked and  a puppy licking your nose at the same time kind of imagine right you have the beauty of that but reverse  the participants right no and then then the girl bites your dick off and kills the puppy but still  you wake up the next day go i want to do that again but dude at 15 i was scared to like like  like half a beer like how does it how does it go through your head that at 15 i'm going to try  heroin i don't get that i had a cast on my arm oh my father hitting me with a baseball bat so like 
[03:44:30]  that's that real yeah i swear to god so why did he hit you okay why not why didn't he broke my arm  with a baseball bat i don't think there is any why but what'd you do wrong in his eyes what could i have  done killed the fucking my little baby brother i understand that but there was a reason why you  sound like a therapist that wants me to block you with that therapist should talk to him no  no do you blame the mumbo jumbo he's pushing me towards like blaming myself for being beaten 
[03:45:00]  is what i'm saying my father you brought it on on yourself no but what was the reason you should be a  rape counselor what were you wearing i'm gonna relate to you not with broken bones but like my  mom would yell and scream when i was a kid over the same thing over the most stupidest  shit what he's saying so what i'm saying is there was some reason why he did it it's not going to  make sense but what is your reason you left your sneakers on the floor what what dumb thing did you  do i don't remember i swear to god like my father was just a violent dude he was a violent guy uh you 
[03:45:30]  know we grew up in violence that i live right across the street from a numbers store where my father hung  out card games all wise guys it was just that's how i grew up hitting kids was normal but like he  would overdo it and he'd so you asked me about shooting the dope right so you got the arm on the  cast yeah my fucking arm's broken from my father so i don't you know i mean there's so much pain  mental anguish that's fucking sticking a needle in my arm it's not the needle that hurt it's what you're 
[03:46:00]  gonna get when you hit the plunger that's why you do it it hurts for a second it's a pinch but then  the blowjob and you know what i mean yeah puppy all of a sudden mommy loves you and everything's  wonderful so you grab the bet uh at fifteen you start snorting it from who no i just neighborhood  guys dude how older yeah a little bit older than me i grew up i'm i'm from throgs neck you know you've  heard of it throgs neck i got a bridge there i know the bridge yeah well there's actually a neighborhood  below that fucking thing yeah now the whole it's all uh isn't that just part of queens you know there's a 
[03:46:30]  lot of guys from harlem there that grew up in harlem italians they would have drug dealers heroin  deal you know so there was a lot of heroin in the neighborhood so i just i tried it it was you know  and i liked it what what'd you get the first time out of it you throw i threw up like an animal  like sick but no but and you want to die but then when you stop throwing up and the drug  does its thing you're like that was so worth it i want more you know wow no it's a great it's a you 
[03:47:00]  know that's why people tell i get paid i actually what was the next time you did it after that  the next day you were done he started his career in a week i was it i was yeah i was hooked in like  a week i had a habit like i had to have it every day what did you get what did you do to get it uh  nothing like voss did i've never was the worst thing you did to get it the worst thing i did uh

[03:49:30]  when we were kids and uh when he died i got the jesus thing because that's the bronc you know italian  thing and then you know i got here and now on my wrists so i don't forget to stay in the  moment try to live in the moment because i'm always all over the place uh and that's about it this is a  tibetan prayer you sure yeah no it is it's so money padme hum it's a great thing i really do i 
[03:50:00]  really meditate and believe it or not yeah yeah no i'm not good at it you're not good at it oh really  oh i'm trying buddy i'm trying i've been through a lot you know what i mean so you were funny the  whole time i don't think when i was on heroin i wasn't that funny but you know when i got into rehab  and all i started developing sense of humor uh like some funny guy like you only want it's like  it's almost like you can tell by talking to a guy if he's a funny guy in the neighborhood and just a  fun guy sure it's like it's like yeah it's like keith robinson i raised i talk about him a lot but 
[03:50:30]  you know like keith is just a shit talker in a funny way yeah he's fun ah shut up yeah one of those guys  that it doesn't have to be a punchline just like i enjoy talking to this guy yeah the technicality of  being a stand-up is starting to get into me but i was always funny i think i always had people  laughing you know what i mean um so you'd be jail funny like you'd be funny in jail yeah yeah no that's  a good thing no doubt mike would make guys in jail yeah that's how i survived my life through jokes i 
[03:51:00]  really did like i was never you know um like i got a lot of friends that are tough you know like tough  guys you know what i mean and they love me because of my sense of humor not because i'm  tough or any of that you know what i mean right right so i'm like this guy that that survived the  the neighborhood and i'm very loved by a lot of people that are you know tough guys like wise guys  like real street guys and but they like me because my sense of humor they want me around yeah so it's 
[03:51:30]  fun you know it's always that's been my my thing wow yeah it's a hell of a story man oh it's nothing bro  i guess i can forget it i mean go figure another up comic another comic that just has a  fucking past but yeah it's the way you relate to it though isn't it though because everyone's got  a past but they're still they're dysfunctional and they still live in it i'm not really living  in i got the anger you know stuff like that that's coming out now but i'm not really like that when 
[03:52:00]  was the last time you hit somebody it's been a while like a couple of months like a couple of  months the one that hot thing that was the last time the thing at the comedy club with a guy  but honestly the guy was swinging right at my face i got him before he got me i was guilty of being  quicker than him that was it there was no my i'm with you with the anger thing i'd slam some guy's uh  you know leg with the cab door uh only friday so i'm with you bro yeah i'm with you and i know how  stupid it is but you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes well because we don't you know we're men and

[03:53:00]  you know we're not that close like if we're really close then it's all bets are off but some  of them just you know there was another i ain't going to say comics names because that i won't do  but this one comic i was going to look at it out of him in 15 seconds i know he can't help me  he just gets riled out like once you get me going comedy club owner ah i'm not going to go  there i'm not going to say his name so marty the fucking animal that he is he's not really a  club owner whatever but yeah he just uh running their fucking mouth they actually went on the radio  when i got passed at the cellar this fucking piece of shit was on like the over at x the

[03:55:00]  what go for the weakness exactly i'm with you me and you are on the same page i'm not really like  that oh that's not what i'm trying to say we're gonna bring it out of you by 11 o'clock he's gonna  beat this shit out of this no i don't want it that's what i'm saying i hate that i can hear the  panic in your voice you're trying to convince us that you're not like that but i think right below  the surface you're like that no i'm a good dude man are you married no no my wife died what  so if you ask questions i'm gonna answer them and we're gonna the show can go off in a whole 
[03:55:30]  another direction i don't care about everything has to be put in the show i don't know if i've told  you that my i was married uh my wife we were clean we got off drugs and uh she got sick  with the hepatitis and and oh yeah and uh she died 
[03:56:00]  jeez mike any other questions wow boy you really want people to come to your comedy show huh dude no  wow the last one so this is what i do sorry but uh no she's there was a long time i mean it's you  know it's like 12 years now it's been a while she died 12 years ago yeah how long were you married  five uh six years uh yeah yeah she was my girl gonna die or was it yeah i knew she got sick after a  couple years i knew she was she was ill and i uh and they couldn't turn this around nah nah once you 
[03:56:30]  have shed all kinds of shit forget it it was she ended up with a lot of uh uh lung damage and  shit from pneumonias it was horrible yeah but no dude you know listen this is what makes me who i am  this is why i'm the way i am and and and this is what makes me a good comic you know at least a good  comic you know with somebody that the people know they're listening to something they're not just  fucking hearing i just gotta write notes you know jokes that are from somewhere else you know it's  coming from inside like you know the pain yeah let me just write this note never have mike on again 
[03:57:00]  oh jeez he might actually kill somebody no somebody mike's a sweet boy you got any other  questions what do you want to share man i mean you're doing good so far um  we would have blown off the goddamn uh are you smarter than a fifth grader if we knew you had this  shit come out of you see try to tell you some tragedy in there huh it's so it's not a big deal  like everyone yeah but so what kind of a big deal it's not you know what that it shouldn't be a big 
[03:57:30]  deal to lose your wife no no that's a biggie for me but it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about it  that's why you know i don't know i'm not even in some ways that's why this country this  shit you were saying before how we're all fucking weak because there's no people don't want to look at  nothing they want to these little fucking douche groups these young kids with that stupid look of  hope walking around like ooh everything's gonna work out it's not you little douchebag look of hope 
[03:58:00]  yeah yeah it's an because it's unreasonable it's unreasonable yeah there's no hope out there there  is hope but it's hope but you're gonna suffer you motherfucker yeah and the hope is that you get  through it i not that you avoid it i do laugh when i hang out with like uh like high school kids  you know within you know the family look at these guys though what the fuck are we doing we want to  see tits and people farting i do laugh when when you do talk to kids that are still in high school  and they have such dreams and you're like you have no fucking idea it's not gonna happen this is what 
[03:58:30]  you want i had a friend joe in high school and we were graduating high school and our senior year he  said this is going to be the best year of our life and i didn't understand at the time but he knew  he just knew that it just gets so bad after high school for many many years and then maybe  some of this hope does turn around for you and you do become successful it's something you want  to get into or whatever but all these uh high school kids with the dreams of being the heart doctor  and being an astronaut and i'm going to be on the olympic team and god bless you i think everyone 
[03:59:00]  should have dreams i certainly had my own dreams when i was growing up but the reality is is what you just  said that there's going to be fucking hell and many years where you don't even know where the  fuck you're going in your life how you're going to pay your bills another chick breaking your heart  all this shit they have no idea in high school it's all just it's easy yeah you know they bitch about  uh a test or something or writing a paper who gives a shit that shit is easy compared to real life  here's the pain deal with it then you'll have hope dude people that's my point then you'll have hope not 
[03:59:30]  you don't make it up as you oh it's going to be perfect i'm going to the american dream the american  dream is fucking you work hard when you're young and then you spend the rest of your life protecting  your fucking money and then you die alone and your kids are home managing their portfolios because that's  what you taught them to fucking do to make money you know and it's all and then some retarded guy  with fucking down syndrome is happy every day hello good morning it's good to see you yeah they have no 
[04:00:00]  words right because they're missing all the shit that makes the rest of us i learned i learned that  less than a while ago i don't i don't feel sorry for for people like that whatsoever because they  they have no clue they're just happy ignorance they're happy in their fucking skin they're simple  dude we had a guy that delivered mail at any w i tell the story every once in a while but it's one of  my favorite stories and he he uh he grew attached to me for whatever reason and uh one day i'm feeling  that way too though i feel that way too well jimmy kind of brought up yesterday there is a there is a 
[04:00:30]  sweetness to me that i don't allow to come out all in but uh he kind of he kind of felt that maybe  because they have like that retard like uh intuition intuition or or an extra sense i don't know and  people around the office what was that piece of paper why i just flicked it i meant it to go over  there and it just missed your head uh people uh around the office like you should take them to lunch  yeah every we take turns taking lunch so he feels part of like the workplace and stuff i'm like  how how bad could this be i'll take him to lunch we'll talk about the mets he's a mets fan and we'll 
[04:01:00]  and and we'll we'll make pictures with crayons on the fucking menus or whatever right so we bring him  down i bring him down to the brooklyn diners just me and him and uh the waitress comes over and she  had big tits and the kid who doesn't look like he's slow by the way is just staring at the tits to the  point where i i i wanted to fucking hide because he doesn't understand to him it's tits and it's  the greatest day of his life he's getting a free lunch and looking at tits and that's all he knew 
[04:01:30]  no manipulation about he doesn't give a try to manipulate it and hide it the waitress is getting  pissed ready to tell this guy off and i'm just like oh my god and i can't tell the waitress that  he's a little slow and that's why he's looking at your tits hey he's retarded but leave him alone  but getting back to your point that's his life yeah he's happy he's not worried about you know getting  a promotion he was happy delivering the mail uh all wrong by the way to the wrong mailboxes but you  know seeing tits for us isn't enough we have to tie her up punch her in the back of the head you know 
[04:02:00]  there's all we need extra shit it's not enough to just look at them and enjoy them but no it's true  like they're very simple people simple people give chocolate milks the meaning of life yeah he's  fucking that you know and craig from scranton pa well oh what about you you made it dude so why can't  other kids dream too that's the only thing that keeps you going i said that we all should have dreams  yeah but you should there's a reality to it too it's not as easy as you think it is when you're  17 18 19 20 years old it's not about i've been doing radio since i was 18 i was only successful 
[04:02:30]  seven years ago right but but you stuck you you stood with it i i wrote the point is these kids are  walking around thinking it's all going to be great well the people that know my timeline of radio  i was in buffalo doing overnights and i moved home to long island to work at bab a place where i started  interning i moved home from buffalo with no money in the bank whatsoever i couldn't even pay the toll  coming back over the bridge to long island i had to actually open up the back and uh and and and  find my change thing to pay the toll i had nothing and i was i was up there already in age yeah you 
[04:03:00]  know and then finally then one thing after another you know worked out for me right it's not you know  it's like but people will see that opening like be disconnected from the reality of how you got to  where you are and the fact that you're still have unhappiness in your fucking life you're not perfectly  happy right it's not life's not like that that's that's all i'm saying get rid of that fucking horse  shit and realize that there's struggles you know you put a fucking ipod on and block it all out look 
[04:03:30]  at an ipod no one's gonna die people are still confused on instant feedback yes i i you should  have the dreams but there's a reality to it as well and you should be prepared for the reality and the  hard work and a lot of disappointment most people don't make it because they're they they get rejected  or whatever and they're like all right i suck right and they quit right you know that's when you should  dig in harder and work harder at what you want to do yeah well their parents are afraid of their 
[04:04:00]  own their parents are afraid so they make them afraid by telling them how perfect they are you're  special penelope penelope you're special you have a wonderful little white vagina it smells like lemon  and coriander it's not dirty you're wonderful then she's 25 someone lets her down and she goes to the  hospital for fucking surgery to repair the fucking dad you know i mean this is all i'm saying so this  assholes you have to have dreams that's not what we're saying you fucking jackass just be prepared 
[04:04:30]  for the reality of it and how hard it really is it you know life is messy man it's hard and messy it's  not easy there's no overnight success you know success story though and the game plan doesn't uh you can't  make a game plan and then follow it and have it work yeah right it falls apart somewhere you're not in  control of it you get these obstacles thrown in there i feel guilty because a lot of uh young guys come up to  me and and uh ask how they get into radio and for many zipper down and then for many years i would i 
[04:05:00]  would like encourage them to get into it i think it was it was a great business now i almost feel bad  that i'd tell these kids don't go into it do something else with your creativity because this  business sucks because you've been well satellite satellite has brought back uh some of the excitement  and i'm not just trying to kiss xm's ass today but they have but the business has changed in such a way  i'm like why why don't bother me right i don't know if it's the same way uh with stand-up i have  no idea if it's changed very much so to me stand up is a way to make sense of all the that i've been 
[04:05:30]  through to be honest with you the first time i ever got on stage was all right let me just tell you one  more sad thing and then i'll make it funny you haven't told us one thing yet no all right my wife  died in march of 95 now i didn't even when my wife died i didn't people said what happened did you fall  apart no i didn't even shed a tear not because i'm tough because my father who i got close to over  the years had a brain tumor so i said let me save it up i don't want to fall apart now wow my dad's  gonna die in a couple of months no this is how human beings react you might have done it yourself in your 
[04:06:00]  life where one bad thing happens to you you don't let yourself really experience it because you're like  my mother's got this issue sickness my father died a few months later i got on a plane from florida to  come to new york to bury my father when i was on the plane i i was done i said i'm done i i was  gonna kill myself but i wasn't angry i wouldn't i was at peace i was like thank god it's over i'm  fucking done i land in new york and um i i go to my father's funeral and my i had a fucking open mic 
[04:06:30]  night scheduled in florida the week later and i remember saying to myself let me just do that  fucking thing then i'll kill myself i swear to god florida it was my first time on stage i never  had done it i booked a gig in florida right right no it was in a bar it was just said it was like  how are you gonna kill yourself did you have it all figured out let me tell you some anybody heroin  you think people shoot themselves have you heard of drugs you asshole it's so simple easy so you just did 
[04:07:00]  it i would have just done it yeah i would have just done a nice dope i'm making a point here and  the point is this that i went and did the open mic night and my first joke i'll never forget it was  it was about guatemalans i still do to my act now because it was funny i said look at these little  fucking guatemalans down here in florida i'm from the bronx we have puerto ricans these guys are like  little brown pokemon they're little tiny little midget right it's a cute fight but i got such a big laugh on 
[04:07:30]  it i don't know what i said for the next 10 minutes but i finished my set and i remember being  like oh yeah i can there is something to live for there's something else there's comedy then i went  and i was using drugs at the time so i went to a narcotics anonymous convention in fort lauderdale  let's get must get some good drugs at a place like that no no no i had four i had four days off of  the drugs and everything i gave myself i said i'm going to try this one more time this whole 
[04:08:00]  getting off drugs thing and all this i go to convention it's pouring rain so this guy was  there he had a lot to do heroin i mean the rain is depressing as shit he had a walkie talkie you've  been hurt opie hey you need therapy i think jim's right shut up with that mumbo jumbo crap no kid so uh  there was this guy with a walkie talking about so i knew he was like in charge of the na thing so i said  dude what's going on he said it's raining we're supposed to have a pool party so there was a dj  and all this i go look i'm a stand-up comedian this is what happened i said i'm a comedian he goes

[04:09:00]  how uh they they sell crack on bicycles they ride around selling crack crack horrors or chemically  enhanced oral pleasure technicians i just came i started coming up with all this drug shit and pain  and it all came out of me and i killed i fucking killed and that was it that's i found that's what  comedy is to me that's what it means to me it's like a way for me to live with all of this pain  would have bombed in florida oh if i would have bombed i wouldn't be i would have killed myself  but i literally killed you know i don't know what killed means it felt so good i made everybody laugh 
[04:09:30]  we joke about therapy a lot on the show lately but this in a way is therapy that you're able to  turn on a mic and just rant and rave you know yeah not not and get somebody it's not going to work  and oh yeah no jimmy i haven't i don't even know what he's talking about but i know he's manipulating  right now yeah he's trying to get me to agree that he doesn't need to go see alan  we have a good therapist he works with a lot of comics i don't see him i see his wife oh his wife 
[04:10:00]  his wife that's that's oh but you hang out with me we'll go do buddhist meditation i'll straighten you  out i'm a cutter when i cut um um do you really no no i don't know i i i i thought we were all  being honest here i thought maybe you were telling us therapy is very helpful but uh urinating when  you've had to for 30 minutes is also helpful yeah we got to take a break so i have to i have to  desperately de stefano you're listening to the worst of the opening show on serious xm you know one time 
[04:10:30]  i've made a couple um this is years ago i paid to watch them have sex it was it was like one of those  no touching you couldn't even be on the bed with them you had to like sit in a chair and is this  something they did or you just approached the no no they were a married couple and they did it i  don't even remember where i found it i think it was before my craigslist days um it was they were  just a married couple and uh they said we just put on shows and uh i watched them and it was hot  he's like watching a porno three feet away from you it really was it was 3d this is great to just sit 
[04:11:00]  there with popcorn did you have little snacks it didn't go unbuttered um it was uh hold on  really sexy to watch but it was it was just depressing because as i'm watching them all i  kept thinking of is my girlfriend i kept thinking if this guy was with her instead of his wife  i'm finished like it depressed me it turned me on wow but it depressed me because uh they were they  were a married couple but he was doing it well yeah it was a lot more than i had it's embarrassing 
[04:11:30]  it was like watching me if i was a man i cannot compete with this like if this guy was with my  girl she i could just picture the look of love and ecstasy in her face while i sat there like i could  never really be a cuckold i could never do it i would just be depressed and unturned on they would  get done and look over and you'd have killed yourself in the corner i'd be weeping softly like  collapsing in my fat stomach nudity not functioning sexually just depressed i would kill the vibe  immediately like how did i don't know wow that's so weird i don't i don't get it so you're in a 
[04:12:00]  hotel room yes and all of a sudden like what they go all right you could just get naked now and the  way it happened was and um like walk us through it like i'm always thinking about oh that's kind of  like just how does it develop it was in la i remember that much and usually la i would never do  stuff in because the girls were awful there any type of situation you had in la there was a problem  so i never did really like no i just didn't always bad for some reason this ad i remember got me like 
[04:12:30]  they just seemed like real people and i emailed and i actually got a phone number and i called it  it was the girl so i knew it was like all right well this is more legit and she's like yeah we're  married blah blah and this is what we do and she's no touching it's watch only like you can't take any  pictures or whatever the hell she said so i got so they came over and literally i was sitting in my  room and i had the lights kind of dim because i was hoping like you know well maybe you know she  was kind of nice on the phone you never know but as soon as i got there uh she's like all right we 
[04:13:00]  got to turn the lights on a little bit so we could i'm like all right so it is watching so um she's like  um you can sit there uh she pointed that there was a chair at the desk so i pulled up to the edge of  the bed i don't want to just stand it was just too creepy oh no yeah you're a little too close no i didn't  get that she was there with her and um and they started kissing and uh literally it was that fast  and then she said to me and this is what made me so crazy she gave me a list of options as as far as  where the uh the finality could occur oh okay where the finale could occur right you got you got a menu 
[04:13:30]  basically just for the last just for the finale that's good for the yeah the grand finale could be  here here here yeah whatever yeah well it's like i'm in the mood i'm in the mood for but you could  see it maybe if you don't want to see it absolutely yeah sure absolutely i'm in a i'm i'm in the mood  for this but i am on a diet uh i like my options yeah i said that i said that's what i'd like to see  but remember sweetie keep your eyes closed and uh so it was kind of hot watching it interactive porn 
[04:14:00]  that's uh not interactive kind of cool you could direct it if you wanted to and i didn't really  want to look at his stupid face it was just kind of because it was too real there's another guy that  i can never function with a guy yeah but if you're not looking at his face you're looking at something  else it's about i'll look at the face yeah how about you uh jimmy here's what they were doing the  hottest part which was one part where i'm looking at his stupid feet and her face at the same time okay  the way she kept looking at me it was almost like this was the sexy part for me they were married 
[04:14:30]  she was never i mean you know believe me she would if she tried to sleep with me i would have  been like are you a dope look what you're married to you're retarded but it was the fact that i felt  she was doing something behind his back by looking at me like that and that was the major part of the  turn on that little sneakiness that moment of sneakiness how how much extra did you pay for that  no but it was only a look because they figured that out a long time ago yeah right look if i give the  look to the guy and we're gonna get a nice tip here but that's all it was it was just it was it was 
[04:15:00]  sexy watching what she was doing at the moment but it was really hot like the little look she  would give me while she was doing it i'm like oh so what did uh what that run you i don't know  buck fifty in that area i don't even remember exactly i think i tipped him a little bit really meant  the dollar fifty in this case i know buck fifty also means 150. no i mean it was 100 200 bucks i  don't actually remember yeah um but it was one of the hotter things i've seen but i didn't get the press  because i was thinking of the girl i was dating just hooking up with this guy and it was bumming 
[04:15:30]  me out i was like oh i could just picture her face and how humiliated i'd be sitting there i don't  know how guys i don't know how you do it how you bring home a guy who's better in bed than you and  watch him show your girl what she's missing that's a whole nother breed of uh that's a whole nother  world my girlfriend now wants to swing i'm going to say no guys under 250. only fat men who sweat a lot  that's it for the worst of we'll beat anthony well gentlemen another show well done i knew what
